1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:01,769
I haven't talked to anyone, really…

2
00:00:01,853 --> 00:00:02,840
Now that we've decided,

3
00:00:02,923 --> 00:00:04,030
should I write down our names?

4
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,690
You're in a group with the "Big Four"?

5
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:07,360
A bunch of strangers, basically…

6
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:09,860
My contact lens fell out.

7
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,780
You can't see well without your glasses,
can you, Hioki?

8
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,500
Whoa!

9
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:15,770
I'm so-sorry…

10
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,330
I'll do anything. Please, just forgive me.

11
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:18,709
I'll think about it.

12
00:00:18,733 --> 00:00:21,590
I'll give you my answer before the trip is
over.

13
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,360
Yeah, what's up?

14
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:37,950
Well, it's just that with your glasses on,

15
00:00:38,033 --> 00:00:38,890
you have a totally different vibe.

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,040
I do?

17
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:43,740
He means you look cute.

18
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,280
Yeah, you're cute.

19
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:47,860
Huh?

20
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:48,890
Oh…

21
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,330
Yeah.

22
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:53,570
There's no way you actually mean that.

23
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,520
It's okay. You don't have to force it.

24
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:58,300
No, I'm serious. You're cute, Hioki.

25
00:00:58,860 --> 00:00:59,870
Huh?

26
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,300
You're cute.

27
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:13,540
Hey, um…

28
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,170
Sorry to break up the lovefest,

29
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,030
but isn't it time for a bath?

30
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:23,290
Speaking of which, Hioki,

31
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:24,840
are you going to be okay in the bath?

32
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,680
Huh?

33
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,040
Hey, listen.

34
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,870
You're gonna take them off when you get
in, right?

35
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:32,500
Your glasses.

36
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:37,820
Oh.

37
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,100
"School Trip Joined a Group I'm Not Close to"

38
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:41,090
(Episode 2)
I totally forgot about the whole bath situation.

39
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,970
It's not like being at home.

40
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,570
But I'm sure it'll work out.

41
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,070
I've got some juicy gossip.

42
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:48,680
Someone saw you…
What…

43
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,950
- Hioki-chan.
- Tsujitani…

44
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,780
Oh, sorry. You guys go on ahead.

45
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:55,980
- Okay.
- Yeah.

46
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,320
We're gonna head in, too.

47
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,850
Later, later.

48
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,470
Oh.

49
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,150
So, I heard…

50
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:12,450
I heard you held hands with Watarai?

51
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:13,680
No! There was a reason for that…

52
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:16,830
That's so not fair! You're all over
the Big Four's Instagram, too.

53
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,000
Man, at this rate,

54
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:20,760
- Hioki's becoming one of the popular kids!
- Hey! Listen to me!

55
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:22,120
- Can't hear you!
- Yes, you can!

56
00:03:22,144 --> 00:03:22,896
Can't hear you!

57
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,450
You can totally hear me!
You're just messing with me, aren't you?

58
00:03:24,533 --> 00:03:24,640
So what happened?
So?

59
00:03:25,483 --> 00:03:26,660
So, so?

60
00:03:26,743 --> 00:03:28,170
What are you talking about?

61
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,460
Was there a confession of love or
something?

62
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:30,030
No way.

63
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,670
- We're going in ahead of you.
- Okay.

64
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:38,950
Sorry about that.

65
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:43,440
What were you guys talking about?

66
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,000
Huh?
Oh.

67
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,350
It wasn't anything really.

68
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,020
Oh, okay.

69
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,640
Anyway,

70
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:53,760
Are you sure you'll be okay?

71
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:56,190
Want to go in together?

72
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,400
No, I'm fine.

73
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,760
I'm seriously fine.

74
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,100
If you say so.

75
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,750
Try not to fall again.

76
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:07,190
I'll be careful.

77
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:18,530
Sigh.

78
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:20,700
I can't bring myself to tell him.

79
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:33,980
Alright.

80
00:04:34,063 --> 00:04:35,200
Finally… I made it.

81
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,440
Whoa.

82
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,480
Ah.

83
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,010
Someone… Can someone turn it off?

84
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,270
- What are you doing?
- Can someone turn it off…?

85
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,980
You saved me.

86
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,070
Is that…

87
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,470
Watarai?

88
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,370
Thank you.

89
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,850
Wait for me after you're done.

90
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,240
Huh?

91
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,860
It would be a pain if you actually fell.

92
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,560
Be careful.

93
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,060
Okay, I'm letting go.
Yeah.

94
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,310
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

95
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,250
Those two are getting along great.

96
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,860
They're like a couple of kindergarden kids.

97
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,230
By the way, Hioki,
what do you do during swimming lessons?

98
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,580
I don't really go swimming.

99
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,980
My vision was better in middle school.

100
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:38,120
Besides, our high school doesn't have a pool.

101
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:39,910
Oh.

102
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,100
What about the beach?

103
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,270
The beach?

104
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:44,910
Even if I go, I don't actually get in the water.

105
00:05:44,993 --> 00:05:46,310
So it's never been a problem.

106
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,180
The beach, huh.

107
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,580
The beach is awesome.

108
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,910
Man, I wanna go.

109
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:56,120
- Man, I really wanna go.
- Then why don't we?

110
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,230
Huh?

111
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,420
- Summer break's coming up, right?
- For real?

112
00:05:59,440 --> 00:05:59,730
Huh?

113
00:05:59,813 --> 00:06:01,480
- Hey, let's go, let's go!
- That's a great idea.

114
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:03,010
Let's all go together!

115
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,270
Then Hioki…

116
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,560
you're in charge of the fireworks.

117
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:11,450
OK.

118
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,740
I'm…

119
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,340
…included in this?

120
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:27,870
- Are you awake?
- Yeah.

121
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,210
Let's talk.

122
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:33,860
Okay.

123
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,680
About what?

124
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,130
Do you even have to ask?

125
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,210
When you're on a school trip,

126
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,580
you obviously talk about romance.

127
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,140
Yeah, let's do it.

128
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,570
Let's talk.

129
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,140
I'm curious about your love life, Hioki.

130
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,050
Huh? Mine?!

131
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,410
Hey, Hioki, do you have a girlfriend?

132
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,750
Uh.

133
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:58,850
No.

134
00:06:58,980 --> 00:06:59,980
I don't.

135
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,270
Aww, man.

136
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:03,710
Really?

137
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,120
Huh?

138
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,160
But didn't you have one in middle school?

139
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:09,450
You know,

140
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,140
the one you were always with.

141
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:14,630
Oh.

142
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:15,950
No.

143
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,080
That was a misunderstanding.

144
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,080
I was just helping a friend through a
tough time.

145
00:07:20,163 --> 00:07:22,020
People just assumed we were dating.

146
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:25,150
And then the rumor just took off.

147
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,450
Oh, so that's what happened.

148
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:29,160
Aww, that's a bummer.

149
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,170
I really wanted to hear one of your
romance stories, Hioki.

150
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,130
Sorry, I don't have any good material for
you.

151
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:37,920
So, in other words,

152
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:40,040
everyone in this room right now

153
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:41,830
is single.

154
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,240
Huh?

155
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,420
Really?

156
00:07:44,503 --> 00:07:45,420
That's kind of surprising.

157
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:47,090
I just

158
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,110
got out of a relationship, too.

159
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,540
Me too.

160
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:53,810
Actually, I'm taking a break from dating
for a while.

161
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,960
Well, yeah, of course.

162
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:58,330
After breaking up the way you did.

163
00:07:58,413 --> 00:07:59,830
Yikes.

164
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,400
Yeah.

165
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,750
Nakasato's girlfriend,

166
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,528
they grew up together and were dating,

167
00:08:06,817 --> 00:08:08,020
but she got stolen away from me.

168
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:11,000
By her college-aged tutor.

169
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,840
Wow.

170
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,860
That's way more dramatic than I expected.

171
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,620
But compared to me,

172
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,080
Morisaki had it way worse, didn't he?

173
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,660
True. Morisaki's ex was,

174
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,230
what's the word…

175
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:27,020
- Super possessive.
- Totally.

176
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,510
Ugh, I don't even want to think about it.

177
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:31,330
Please, just drop it.

178
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,020
It's past lights out. Go to sleep.

179
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:37,950
Oh, Suzuki-kun.

180
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,560
I don't know,

181
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,600
it seems like being a hot guy is tough,
too.

182
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:45,950
Anyway, is this what talking about romance

183
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,350
on a school trip is supposed to feel like?

184
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,460
Alright, good night.

185
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,280
But,

186
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,760
speaking of intense people,

187
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,520
- Watarai's pretty intense, too.
- He is.

188
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:05,480
No, I'm not.

189
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,910
We're not talking about your ex.

190
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,260
We mean you, Watarai.

191
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,540
It's not just intense,

192
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,500
you're also super jealous.

193
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,030
Once you fall for someone,

194
00:09:15,113 --> 00:09:16,880
you're the type to get way too invested,
right?

195
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,220
That's an exaggeration.

196
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:21,850
Oh, but according to his ex,

197
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:24,590
she said it was actually really
suffocating.

198
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:25,310
Oh.

199
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,400
And also,

200
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:28,310
she said you lead people on without
meaning to.

201
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,360
That's the review from a teenage girl.

202
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,400
Hey.

203
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,160
Don't talk about it like you're reviewing
a product.

204
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:35,230
Oh, by the way…

205
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,430
Don't give Hioki any weird ideas.

206
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:39,650
Yeah.

207
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,300
There's still a lot more.

208
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,470
And another one…

209
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,840
- That's enough.
- Seriously?

210
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,560
- Yeah, stop.
- Oh, crap…

211
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,700
Whoa, I got it, I got it.

212
00:09:55,783 --> 00:09:58,500
It's three against one again.
Hioki, come on.

213
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:00,240
Go, go, throw it!

214
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,200
Okay.

215
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,400
Whoa.

216
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:12,590
The sun's coming up.

217
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:19,600
It's so beautiful.

218
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:23,170
It really is.

219
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,830
Such a beautiful sunrise.

220
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:27,870
You know,

221
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,470
I really like the morning sun.

222
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,660
I don't get it.

223
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,950
Yeah, more than the sunset.

224
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:34,790
I'm a morning sun person too.

225
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,440
Oh.

226
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:38,030
Hioki, you're up?

227
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,380
Ah, yeah.

228
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:43,370
What's wrong?

229
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,120
Don't tell me you're not feeling well.

230
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:54,940
No.

231
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:56,720
It's not that.

232
00:10:58,330 --> 00:10:59,530
Are you okay?

233
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,220
You can take your time.

234
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,520
Just try telling us.

235
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:03,950
Well…

236
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:06,150
Um…

237
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,670
My name…

238
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:11,130
is also "Asahi."

239
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,520
Ah.

240
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:18,930
You don't mean…

241
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,260
The morning sun…

242
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,560
Asahi.

243
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:26,190
Huh, is that it?

244
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:30,410
That's it?

245
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:32,170
Ah.

246
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:34,490
Sorry.

247
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:37,850
That's so cute!

248
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:43,840
I thought you'd think I was weird…

249
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,990
I was so worried.

250
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,300
Geez. Ah.

251
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:51,850
That's great.

252
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,320
Let's take a picture.

253
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,290
- Hurry up, let's take one.
- The lighting is perfect right now.

254
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,140
It'll definitely look good.

255
00:11:58,223 --> 00:12:00,060
- Yeah, yeah, totally.
- Here, look.

256
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,420
Hioki, you too.

257
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:02,490
Oh, okay.

258
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,690
- Hioki, hurry, get in the middle.
- Wait.

259
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:09,620
- Over here, over here.
- Okay, okay. 3, 2, 1.

260
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:14,710
It turned out pretty good, right?

261
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:18,420
Yeah, it's cute. Looks great, cute.

262
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:20,290
Ah, it's backwards, it's backwards.

263
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:23,880
This is awesome.

264
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,310
Okay, students going to the amusement
park, please gather over here.

265
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,310
The second day of the school trip.

266
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,150
The main event of the day was free time.

267
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,280
Our group was going to the amusement park.

268
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:38,970
Should I bring tissues?

269
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,370
Um, I'm sure you all know,

270
00:12:44,453 --> 00:12:46,050
but once we get there,

271
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:48,370
the boys and girls must stick together.

272
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,030
Yes.

273
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:59,128
Is hanging out with girls that bad?

274
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,470
But after hearing those love stories last
night,

275
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,810
I can't say I blame you.

276
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,960
What should we do?

277
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,100
Why don't we all just ditch?

278
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,680
Ditch and go where?

279
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:13,920
You know, I was thinking.

280
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:16,270
Do we really have to stay together the
whole time?

281
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,320
- Huh?
- No.

282
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:19,990
I mean, the teachers

283
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,350
can't possibly be watching us the whole
time.

284
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,320
Why don't we decide on a meeting spot

285
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,230
and then split?

286
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:29,730
That's it!

287
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,460
Great idea. You're a genius.

288
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,540
Today's going to be so much fun then.

289
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:40,990
Hey, we can't do that.

290
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:42,730
- Huh?
- Huh?

291
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,000
Because we could just split up

292
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,620
and meet up again later, right?

293
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:48,140
No, that's against the rules.

294
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:51,270
- But…
- But the teachers will be patrolling.

295
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:52,810
Wouldn't it be terrible if we got caught?

296
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:58,200
Besides, I heard some upperclassmen last
year got suspended for breaking the rules.

297
00:13:58,510 --> 00:13:59,510
That's right.

298
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,360
So,

299
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,640
let's all stick together.

300
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:05,670
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

301
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:09,830
In the end,

302
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:12,370
the girls' persistence won out.

303
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:16,220
Let me see, let me see, let me see.

304
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,240
What do you think?
So cute.

305
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,070
Then again,

306
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,800
everyone complained,

307
00:14:22,883 --> 00:14:24,740
but they were actually having a lot of
fun.

308
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:28,490
Hioki, you should pick one too.

309
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,620
From these?

310
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:33,300
Oh, I pick these for you.

311
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,540
Okay.

312
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:42,210
So cute.

313
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:44,730
Thanks…

314
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:47,920
Then I'll get this one.

315
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,360
- This one's pretty cute.
- How is it?

316
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,920
Yeah.

317
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:53,290
It suits you.

318
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:55,010
Is it cute?

319
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:56,330
- I see.
- Yeah.

320
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:00,230
Thanks.

321
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,570
Sorry for the wait, everyone.

322
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:09,980
Here, please get on.

323
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:14,430
- It's here, it's here!
- Whoa, this is awesome.

324
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Ah.

325
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,060
Ah, this…

326
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:20,440
- Watarai-kun…
- Hioki, let's sit together.

327
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,120
Okay.

328
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,220
The doors are closing.

329
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,460
Thank you.

330
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,660
Don't tell me…

331
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,980
Are you not good with these kinds of
rides?

332
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,840
Oh, no, I can handle this.

333
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,620
But I can't do intense ones like roller
coasters.

334
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:40,430
I see.

335
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:42,490
If you feel like you can't take it,

336
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,760
let me know.

337
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:45,060
Okay. Thank you.

338
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,160
Yeah.

339
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:49,080
- All right.
- The ride is starting.

340
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,160
Whoa, whoa.

341
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:21,530
Nakasato, I'll take a picture for you.

342
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:24,140
- It looks good on you.
- Thanks.

343
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,270
Hioki, you've got some ketchup on you.

344
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:35,610
Hm?

345
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:41,610
The other side.

346
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,600
Sorry.

347
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,800
Thanks.

348
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,560
Hey, Hioki-kun.

349
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,260
What are you to Watarai-kun?

350
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,960
Huh? Nothing at all…

351
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:06,330
But you two suddenly got so close, didn't
you?

352
00:17:06,413 --> 00:17:08,410
You barely even talked before the school
trip.

353
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:09,230
Why?

354
00:17:09,313 --> 00:17:10,550
Hey, Hioki-kun.

355
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,760
Just who exactly are you?

356
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:14,620
- I'm nothing special…
- And yesterday…

357
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:16,510
I heard you guys held hands.

358
00:17:16,534 --> 00:17:17,236
That was just…

359
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:20,160
- Seriously? I'm so jealous.
- Right?

360
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:22,310
Hey, how did you two get so close?

361
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:25,310
How…? I didn't really do anything…

362
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,480
Please.

363
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:29,070
We really want to get on good terms with
the Four Heavenly Kings.

364
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:30,910
By the way, Watarai-kun…

365
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,620
Is he that friendly with everyone?

366
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,980
What about Morisaki-kun?

367
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,400
Does he have a girlfriend right now?

368
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,230
And Nakasato-kun?

369
00:17:36,313 --> 00:17:37,520
Do you know what his type is?

370
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,620
Tell us.

371
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,080
Um…

372
00:17:41,163 --> 00:17:42,080
I…

373
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:44,370
What's wrong?

374
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:47,520
It's fine. It's nothing.

375
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,900
Right?

376
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,250
Let's go.

377
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,120
Did something happen?

378
00:17:58,130 --> 00:17:59,710
It's nothing.

379
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:01,010
I see.

380
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,780
30-minute wait from this point.

381
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,080
The line is huge.

382
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,750
It says it's a 30-minute wait.

383
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,800
Hioki.

384
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:20,290
Are you sure you'll be okay by yourself?

385
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,560
Yeah, I'm totally fine.

386
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,270
I'm used to being alone.

387
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,840
Sorry about this. Later, we can all go on

388
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:26,110
the merry-go-round together.

389
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:28,150
-No, no, we don't have to
ride the merry-go-round.

390
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:29,990
Well then…

391
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,820
Hit us up if you need anything.

392
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:33,810
Take care.

393
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,140
Let's go.

394
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:36,730
Let's go, let's go.

395
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:51,050
What should I do now?

396
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,310
If there is space ahead of you,
please move forward.

397
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,640
Hey, I have a suggestion.

398
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,120
After we're done with this,

399
00:19:09,203 --> 00:19:11,400
what if the seven of us
go on another ride together?

400
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,880
But…

401
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:14,540
Hioki is waiting for us.

402
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,260
But,

403
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:18,360
-Hioki-kun can't handle thrill rides, right?

404
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,340
He's going to be waiting anyway,

405
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:21,690
so I don't think it makes a difference.

406
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,500
In that case, we should just go on rides
Hioki can handle.

407
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,220
Didn't Hioki-kun say it himself?

408
00:19:26,303 --> 00:19:27,500
He's used to being alone.

409
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:29,360
He's always alone at school anyway.

410
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,760
It should be fine, right?

411
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:32,290
No.

412
00:19:32,373 --> 00:19:33,390
Of course it's not fine.

413
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,220
We can't do that.

414
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:41,970
Besides, look.

415
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:42,650
If we do that,

416
00:19:42,733 --> 00:19:45,060
then Hioki would be the only one on his
own.

417
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,710
According to the rules,

418
00:19:46,793 --> 00:19:47,910
that's not allowed, is it?

419
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:49,710
Well…

420
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,700
I mean, yeah, but…

421
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:54,140
If you girls don't want to go that badly,

422
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:55,830
why don't you just go on your own?

423
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,750
Oh, no, that's not it.

424
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,570
We were just…

425
00:19:59,653 --> 00:20:01,140
Anyway, once this is over,

426
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:03,730
I'm only sticking with Hioki.

427
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:09,990
By the way,

428
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,070
why are you so protective of Hioki-kun?

429
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:17,880
You guys weren't even that close at the
beginning.

430
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,780
Watarai-kun,

431
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:27,610
about Hioki-kun…

432
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,150
What do you even see in him?

433
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,960
Well… How should I put this?

434
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:57,110
So what is Hioki-kun to you, Watarai-kun?

435
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,880
That's true.

436
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,670
Now that you mention it…

437
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:04,650
In that case…

438
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:06,230
I'll sit next to Hioki.

439
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,010
From the very beginning,

440
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:13,420
he's been so considerate of me.

441
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,880
Watarai…

442
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,560
What does he…

443
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,620
like about me?

444
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,430
What am I even thinking?

445
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,200
We should get going.

446
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,220
Huh?

447
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:46,500
That was so fun.

448
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:50,810
Huh?

449
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:52,010
Where's Hioki?

450
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,300
What?

451
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,520
Did he go to the restroom?

452
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,320
Did he text anyone?

453
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,350
- No.
- I'll call him.

454
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:02,230
I'm calling him now.

455
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,320
But he's not picking up.

456
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,080
What?

457
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,680
Wait, seriously? Where did he go?

458
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:09,090
Don't tell me…

459
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,270
he's lost.

460
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:14,330
We'll be in deep trouble if the teachers
find out.

461
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:17,810
I'll try calling too.

462
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,540
Where are you? Mommy, where are you?

463
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,780
Mommy…

464
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,610
Is there anywhere we haven't looked?

465
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,260
Hioki.

466
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,280
(Next Episode)
Hioki.

467
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,720
(Hioki Is Missing)
Where are you…

468
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,100
Why is Watarai…

469
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:45,400
so nice to me?

470
00:22:45,401 --> 00:22:46,605
(Love Accelerates in the Haunted House?!)

471
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:47,630
If you get scared,

472
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,000
you can hold my hand.

473
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,640
Good night.

474
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:54,570
Good night.
