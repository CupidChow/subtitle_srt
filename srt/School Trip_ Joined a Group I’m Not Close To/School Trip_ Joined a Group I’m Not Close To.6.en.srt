1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:02,550
Are you Hioki Asahi?

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:04,010
Huh?

3
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:05,550
Oh.

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,330
Well, you're pretty cute.

5
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,350
Ho.. How... how do you know my name?

6
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:14,340
You're Naoya's friend, right?

7
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:16,330
Naoya?

8
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,790
Morisaki Naoya.

9
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:19,430
- Huh?
- Hey.

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,520
Get over here.

11
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:22,220
Hey!

12
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:24,380
Hey, hey!

13
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:26,830
Come on, come on.

14
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:30,490
There were three other high schoolers.

15
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,300
Are you guys friends?

16
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:34,010
Yes, we're friends.

17
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:35,230
Ah, in that case...

18
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:36,740
that's too bad.

19
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,089
Huh?

20
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:40,080
See, those guys got into a bit of trouble.

21
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,280
Anyway.

22
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,410
Just get in the car.

23
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:47,050
I... I have to get in?

24
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:48,370
Hurry up...

25
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,680
Come on.

26
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:51,690
Huh? Huh...

27
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,890
What in the world...

28
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,640
is going on?

29
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,960
Is he going to bury me somewhere?

30
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,500
Um...

31
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,820
Where are Morisaki and the others...?

32
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,660
Those guys?

33
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,800
Don't worry. They're still alive.

34
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:32,000
"Still" alive... Don't tell
me he's really going to...

35
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,140
Alright, it's about time we get going.

36
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:35,550
Asahi.

37
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:38,930
Do you have any...

38
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,110
last words?

39
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:43,590
L... Last?

40
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,080
Yeah.

41
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:47,130
Last words.

42
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,370
It won't open.

43
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,290
So...

44
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:02,000
do you have any...

45
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,510
last words?

46
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,180
Hm?

47
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,840
I...

48
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,520
I want to call...

49
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:20,660
my family.

50
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:28,960
What's with you?

51
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,400
That's adorable.

52
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,100
Huh?

53
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:35,130
My family.

54
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:36,910
- Hioki...
- My family.

55
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:39,130
My family.

56
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:43,580
Hioki...

57
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,590
Are you okay?

58
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,920
That must have been scary.

59
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:48,770
Let's go.

60
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:50,580
- Huh?
- Hey!

61
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:52,430
You okay?

62
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:54,800
Sorry, we scared you.

63
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,600
Don't tell me Ryoko-san made you cry.

64
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,200
Ryoko... san.

65
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,440
By the way, are you guys okay?

66
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,080
He was just messing with you.

67
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,690
He's my older brother.

68
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,450
How are you feeling now?

69
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,180
Any...

70
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,150
last words?

71
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,230
Huh?

72
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,530
Can I go home now?

73
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:23,000
School Trip: Joined a
Group I’m Not Close to

74
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,260
I'm really sorry.
Don't be mad, Asahi-kun.

75
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,060
(Episode 6: Summer Vacation)
I'm not mad.

76
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:31,520
Sorry about that.

77
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,050
That's just how my brother is.

78
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,780
Come on, forgive me.

79
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:37,010
For the rest of the day,
I'll be your driver...

80
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,030
and your chaperone...

81
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,150
and I'll take good care of you.

82
00:04:41,419 --> 00:04:42,295
Right, Naoya?

83
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,450
This guy is our chaperone?

84
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,130
That makes me even more nervous.

85
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:47,630
But you were pretty cute, though.

86
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,710
The look on your face
when you were about to cry.

87
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,250
Huh?

88
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,960
Hioki, did you cry?

89
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,180
No, I didn't cry.

90
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,230
Are you really okay?

91
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,940
Yeah.

92
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:04,980
I'm fine.

93
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:07,150
I'm sorry.

94
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,440
For scaring you.

95
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,660
What...

96
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,290
What is this...

97
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,110
sweet atmosphere?

98
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:17,130
Thank you...

99
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:18,490
for not running away.

100
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,390
Yeah.

101
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,030
Hey!

102
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,780
Hurry up, you two!

103
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,760
- We're heading to the beach!
- Let's go.

104
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,040
- Hurry up.
- You're so slow.

105
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,240
Come on.

106
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,860
Let's go, let's go, to the beach!

107
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,260
Coming, coming, coming, coming!

108
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,470
Whoa! The ocean!

109
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,250
Sorry to keep you waiting.

110
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,920
Here I come, ocean...

111
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,820
The ocean~

112
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,490
- Hey, don't leave me behind!
- You guys are crazy.

113
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:55,780
Let's go over there.

114
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:58,940
Hioki, you come too.

115
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,539
Huh? No, thanks. I'll
just watch from here...

116
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:01,940
- Why not?
- Wait, hold on...

117
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,030
This is awesome! Whoa~

118
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,960
- Stop it, don't splash me!
- Nice, nice...

119
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,120
Naoya, hey!

120
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:32,630
Being lazy are we? Why be lazy at the
beach!?

121
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:35,980
Whoa, run for it!

122
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,440
Okay.

123
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,250
Ready...

124
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,319
Set?

125
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,540
Heave-ho~

126
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,420
What happens to the loser?

127
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:50,490
- Hey, should there be a penalty?
- Two.

128
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:52,490
Anyway, the loser gets a penalty.

129
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:54,070
- Huh?
- One... Go!

130
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,430
Whoa!

131
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,480
Ah, there he is... Hioki.

132
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,560
Over here, over here, wave!

133
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,470
I can't.

134
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,200
- This is heavier than I thought.
- Yeah, it's so heavy.

135
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,060
You okay?

136
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,140
- Huh?
- I'll get it.

137
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:23,210
Sorry.

138
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,520
- Ah, you okay? It's really heavy.
- Yeah, it is.

139
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,270
Alright!

140
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:31,110
Okay, heave-ho.

141
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:32,770
Here.

142
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,120
Okay, wait.

143
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,560
So... where's Hioki?

144
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,060
Oh, he went over there.

145
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:44,290
- I'll go check on him.
- Okay.

146
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:47,350
- Where'd he go?
- Huh... Over there?

147
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,270
Hioki.

148
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:05,290
What are you doing?

149
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,520
Ta-da!

150
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:10,770
It's beautiful, right?

151
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:15,930
Yeah.

152
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:17,890
It's beautiful.

153
00:08:18,173 --> 00:08:19,173
Right?

154
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,720
Anyway, let's go.

155
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:24,880
Everyone's waiting.

156
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,380
Okay.

157
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:28,010
Hioki.

158
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,270
Hm?

159
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,390
Hey, are you listening?

160
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:32,660
Mmm...

161
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:38,570
Huh? What?

162
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,470
Since you won't listen, I'll
have to carry you by force.

163
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,280
No, don't!

164
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:44,470
Wait... Ah, stop!

165
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:45,730
I'm heavy!

166
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,110
Here we go.

167
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:51,140
- No, no, no, no!
- What are you doing?

168
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:54,180
What a big baby.

169
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,250
Huh?

170
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,560
So cute... Look this way.

171
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,440
No pictures!

172
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:08,950
In the end...

173
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,220
I was carried all the way here.

174
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,560
Ah, thank you.

175
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,260
Are your arms okay?

176
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:17,880
They might be sore tomorrow.

177
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,880
Sorry.

178
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:21,110
I'll go on a diet.

179
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,760
Huh?

180
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,766
Does that mean you want
me to carry you again?

181
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,230
No, no, no, that's not what I meant!

182
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,620
Just kidding.

183
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:41,300
Watarai, you really are...

184
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,190
so kind.

185
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:46,590
Give it your all... Whoa~

186
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:49,010
Yay! Awesome, awesome!

187
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:53,960
Nice.

188
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,240
Let's eat, I wanna eat eat eat.

189
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:57,550
- So good!
- It's cut perfectly! - Bring it here.

190
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:00,650
Can I eat it?
Of course you can.

191
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,590
Go ahead.

192
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:09,460
Hioki, on the side of your mouth...
you've got something.

193
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,510
Thanks.

194
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,370
You've got it good, Hioki.

195
00:10:15,145 --> 00:10:16,416
Having such a devoted die-hard fan by your
side.

196
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,240
(Die-hard fan)

197
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,250
What's that?

198
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:22,680
It means he only has eyes for Hioki.

199
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,340
(Refuses to Share)
And he refuses to share him.

200
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:26,860
You really get it.

201
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,950
Yeah, that's great for you.

202
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,340
Mmm... Now he's sulking.

203
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:32,990
It's fine.

204
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,640
Come on, let me keep you company.

205
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,490
No, that's okay.

206
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,460
Huh?

207
00:10:44,461 --> 00:10:45,950
Don't be shy.

208
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,290
Come on, let's just talk.

209
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,009
Come with me to the convenience store.

210
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:52,020
- Convenience store?
- N-No... I'm okay. This is scary, so scary!

211
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,080
Okay, right.

212
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:55,310
Please let go of me.

213
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:57,210
Hey, mister...

214
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,690
Why are you holding my hand?

215
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,940
Thank you. I'll take it.

216
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:13,440
- I'm back.
- Welcome back.

217
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,100
Here you go.

218
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:16,370
It's from Ryoko.

219
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,440
Thanks.

220
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,270
No problem. It's fine.

221
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,920
Is it good?

222
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,100
- Yeah.
- Here we go.

223
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:29,810
Delicious.

224
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,030
You two seem close.

225
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:34,730
You and Ryoko...

226
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:37,930
Are you jealous?

227
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:39,630
No, it's not that.

228
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,170
It's okay to be jealous, you know.

229
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,790
Th... that's not what I meant.

230
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,380
Hey~

231
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,280
Can you film me from over there?

232
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,600
Sure.

233
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:06,950
It's not that it bothers me.

234
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:08,810
It's just...

235
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:10,450
ever since that day,

236
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,180
every now and then,

237
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:14,060
I find myself thinking about Watarai.

238
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:16,610
Hioki.

239
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,240
What do you think about kissing a friend?

240
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:23,880
Ah.

241
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:24,950
Ice cream.

242
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:27,630
It's melting.

243
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,930
Maybe I should tell him.

244
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,890
But if I say something to him now...

245
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,250
Oh.

246
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:50,530
Huh?

247
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,270
Sorry, your ice cream...

248
00:12:58,990 --> 00:12:59,990
Hmm?

249
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,220
It's fine. Thanks.

250
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:40,800
Asahi, do you have a girlfriend?

251
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:42,370
Huh? Me?

252
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:44,770
- Yep.
- Oh, Hioki doesn't have a girlfriend.

253
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,180
Oh, and by the way,

254
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,109
- He's never had one, either.
- Hey, why are you guys answering for him?

255
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:52,710
We've already done
our research on all this.

256
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:56,480
So you have zero dating experience?

257
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,860
Don't you have a crush on anyone?

258
00:13:58,450 --> 00:13:59,950
Huh? No...

259
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:01,030
What about your type?

260
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,680
I don't really have one.

261
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,090
Well, let's say,

262
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:10,910
if you were a girl, Asahi,

263
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,320
- Huh?
- If you were a girl,

264
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,350
and you had to pick one of the four,

265
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:18,830
who would it be?

266
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,450
What kind of question is that?

267
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:23,080
- Dude, stop messing around.
- What's the big deal?

268
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:25,020
Just give it a thought.

269
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:29,280
- Out of these four...
- Yeah.

270
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,520
Imagine it.

271
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:33,870
If you were going to date one of them,

272
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,030
what would it be?

273
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:51,490
Well...

274
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,280
I guess...

275
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:54,900
I'd...

276
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:58,100
Hey there, boys.

277
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,700
Are you college students?
What are you all up to?

278
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,460
What gives? It's a total sausage fest.

279
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,860
Then again, you're all pretty cute.

280
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,760
Are you celebs?

281
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:10,630
Or influencers?

282
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,220
Hey, come hang out with us.

283
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,340
Um, uh...

284
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,880
Excuse me, could you please leave?

285
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,200
They're underage.

286
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,200
Underage, huh?

287
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:25,840
It's fine if you can't
drink. Just come hang.

288
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:29,690
- Yeah!
- Come on, picture time!

289
00:15:29,715 --> 00:15:31,250
[unintelligible straight man noise]

290
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,000
Please stop.

291
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:36,910
Huh?

292
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:38,210
Why?

293
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,000
Could you please leave?

294
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:45,770
Because you're a nuisance.

295
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:49,000
What? What did you just say?

296
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:50,610
You're a pain.

297
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:52,980
I said get lost.

298
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:55,700
What's your problem?

299
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,120
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

300
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,800
What are you doing?

301
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,370
This is getting annoying.

302
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,270
You're causing trouble.

303
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:07,152
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

304
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:11,550
Hioki.

305
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,260
Are you okay?

306
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:15,670
I was just startled.

307
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,670
Those guys just...

308
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,380
Oh, wait a sec, that...

309
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:25,350
Hioki, is that...?

310
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,880
- This is definitely alcohol.
- Alcohol?

311
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:30,290
Who has water?

312
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:31,411
Does anyone have some water?

313
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,500
Here.

314
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:34,580
Thank you.

315
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:47,550
Are you okay?

316
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,460
Feeling any better?

317
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:55,090
Mmm... I still feel a little strange.

318
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,200
Light-headed.

319
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:01,610
Maybe you should lie down.

320
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,590
Oh, I'll go get the picnic blanket.

321
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:06,490
Wait.

322
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,520
Stay here.

323
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:11,330
Huh?

324
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:12,740
Having you here...

325
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,260
makes me happy.

326
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:19,630
Okay.

327
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,160
It's all right.

328
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,000
I'm sorry.

329
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:33,520
I'm always causing you trouble.

330
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:36,050
Mmm.

331
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:37,970
That's not true at all.

332
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,960
Besides, I told you before, didn't I?

333
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:44,080
You can lean on me when things get tough.

334
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,720
Thank you.

335
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:53,670
Then...

336
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,240
- Hmm?
- Just a little more.

337
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:01,650
Let me be a little selfish.

338
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,510
Huh?

339
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:13,530
Hioki.

340
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
You're drunk.

341
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,420
I don't know.

342
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,610
But for some reason,

343
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,760
this feels so comforting.

344
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:30,180
Is... is that...

345
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,480
only with me?

346
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,230
Yeah.

347
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,080
Only you.

348
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,020
I wonder why.

349
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,500
Is it your scent?

350
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:56,680
Your scent...

351
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,170
is so calming.

352
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:04,990
Ah.

353
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,680
I can't.

354
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,690
Ah... I'm so sorry.

355
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,110
Mmm.

356
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,360
It's okay.

357
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,740
No, that's not it.

358
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:19,130
Um...

359
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:20,910
Yeah?

360
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,200
I...

361
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,560
feel a little sick.

362
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,200
What?

363
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:33,630
Sorry.

364
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:35,189
Water, drink some water.

365
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:36,190
Oh, sorry. Thanks.

366
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:41,310
You okay?

367
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:45,830
Yeah.

368
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:50,730
Watarai.

369
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,020
You're too kind.

370
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,270
Huh?

371
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,110
Am I?

372
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:05,080
You carried me all the way back.

373
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:08,210
When I lean on you,

374
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,520
you always hold me steady.

375
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,860
That's because...

376
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:19,520
it's just for you, Hioki.

377
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,380
Because I'm a die-hard fan.

378
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,310
Mmm.

379
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,780
From now on, if I ever see you in trouble,

380
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,630
I'll come running.

381
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:39,170
If you want to be selfish,

382
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:41,880
I'll always be by your side.

383
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,440
Then,

384
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,970
what if I asked to borrow money?

385
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:49,780
Huh?

386
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,580
Well, that depends...

387
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,100
on the amount.

388
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:57,630
You're supposed to refuse!

389
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:00,450
Well...

390
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:01,950
But,

391
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:04,520
if you spoil me too much,

392
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,370
I'll become useless.

393
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:13,510
It's okay if you become useless.

394
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:17,520
I'll take care of you forever.

395
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,190
What's that supposed to mean?

396
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,520
What are you getting at?

397
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,910
I'll cherish you forever.

398
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:32,230
I've always...

399
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,300
been curious.

400
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:35,480
Why Watarai...

401
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:36,770
is so...

402
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:39,030
good to me.

403
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:41,390
But...

404
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,630
deep down...

405
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,710
maybe I've known

406
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,910
the answer all along.

407
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,350
Oh, um...

408
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,110
Huh?

409
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:02,170
Wait... don't tell me...

410
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:04,650
right now...

411
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,340
am I...

412
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,770
being confessed to?

413
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:24,010
Yeah.

414
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,970
So that response means...

415
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,999
Watarai-kun, you...

416
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,500
I like you.

417
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:40,130
I...

418
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:43,480
I like Hioki-kun.

419
00:22:59,100 --> 00:22:59,600
(Next Episode)

420
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:02,660
(The Day Their Love Began)
A day so happy I'll never forget it.

421
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,360
Hioki... Asahi.

422
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:06,266
(The Truth of That Day)
Can we add one more person?

423
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:06,800
That way...

424
00:23:06,801 --> 00:23:09,210
I can be in the same
group as the person I like.
