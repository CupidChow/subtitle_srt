00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:03,440
Over these past three days,
I've learned a lot about you, Hioki.

2
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:07,740
And it's made me want to
get to know you even better.

3
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:12,290
So...

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,200
If you don't mind, will you...

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,130
No way...

6
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,780
Is he about to confess his feelings for me?

7
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:24,570
Will you...

8
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:33,950
be my friend?

9
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,160
Huh?

10
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,870
Fr-friends?

11
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:42,620
Yeah.

12
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,960
Friends.

13
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:46,110
Huh...?

14
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:53,690
Sorry.

15
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,480
Huh?

16
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:57,500
Oh, no, what I meant was...

17
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,709
I guess I already
thought of you as a friend.

18
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:01,820
So... sorry about that.

19
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:03,490
Oh...

20
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:09,070
So, um...

21
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:12,750
I'm really happy.

22
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:14,870
I'm happy you said that.

23
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:18,970
I'd like that, too. I'm
looking forward to it.

24
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,070
Thank you.

25
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,160
But...

26
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,350
When I say "friend"...

27
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,350
I don't mean just a regular friend.

28
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,600
Huh?

29
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,860
What do you mean by that?

30
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:45,550
Uh... well... for example...

31
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,650
When you're feeling lonely, Hioki...

32
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,330
I want you to call me without hesitating.

33
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,736
And when you're having a tough time, too.

34
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,476
I want to be the first, the first person...
the first person you think to turn to.

35
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,080
Oh...

36
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,120
So, in other words,

37
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,400
a relationship where we
don't have to hold back? Right...?

38
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,250
Thank you.

39
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,260
Then that's what I'll do.

40
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:14,690
Okay.

41
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:16,350
Then we'll do that.

42
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,370
Okay.

43
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,110
Ah.

44
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,120
Well then...

45
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:28,930
I'm looking forward to it.

46
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:32,490
Me too.

47
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:37,710
Yeah.

- Morning.

(Episode 5: School Assembly)

51
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,630
So cute.

52
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:52,290
Three months had passed
since the start of the second year.

53
00:03:54,956 --> 00:03:55,956
Hioki.

54
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,390
Morning.

55
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,170
- Morning.
- Morning.

56
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,209
- Morning.
- Morning.

57
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:03,410
In my class,

58
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:06,100
I made some new friends.

59
00:04:06,589 --> 00:04:07,789
Do you have a charger...

60
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:10,330
Yeah.

61
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,780
Making friends...

62
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:14,410
is something I should be grateful for...

63
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,020
Hioki.

64
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:18,910
I'll help you.

65
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,890
- No... but...
- We're friends, right?

66
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:22,630
Thank you.

67
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:26,430
For someone like me,
who's used to being alone,

68
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,900
it still isn't familiar.

69
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:29,550
Hioki.

70
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,510
- Let's go.
- Oh, sorry, sorry.

71
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:41,460
Passing from behind is dangerous!

72
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:44,370
Hehehe...

73
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,440
Hioki, hold on.

74
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,490
Oh, huh? Oh, sorry.

75
00:05:09,046 --> 00:05:10,880
Omgggggg look.

76
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:14,090
- Wow, so cool.
- Like a prince.

77
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,260
There you go.

78
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,230
Oh... thank you.

79
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,490
I'm not used to it.

80
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,530
Hioki, do you like sausages?

81
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,259
- Yeah.
- I brought extra.

82
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,210
- Here, have one.
- Oh... thanks.

83
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:41,370
Thank you.

84
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,510
I'm not used to it...

85
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:48,720
but really, friends do all this for each other?

86
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:51,879
Well then... Hioki.

87
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,090
Want my konjac?

88
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:53,810
Huh?

89
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:55,300
You can have my broccoli, too.

90
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,920
You guys just don't like
it yourselves, do you?

91
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,720
Then... here you go.

92
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:07,109
- Don't just put it in there!
- Hold on.

93
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,290
No, no, no.

94
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,620
Oh, want some?

95
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:13,550
Here.

96
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:28,550
Mm.

97
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,310
Sweet.

98
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,360
Thanks.

99
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,980
I have no idea what the
definition of a "friend" is anymore.

100
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:54,480
Hey, the bell rang. Let's pack up.

101
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:57,470
Next is the school-wide assembly.

102
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,890
We'll be reviewing the field trip.

103
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,490
So don't forget your
handbooks and writing utensils.

104
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:03,790
Okay.

105
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:06,049
- Don't forget, everyone.
- Okay!

106
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,960
Hayato, could you please erase the board?

107
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,170
- Sure.
- Thanks.

108
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:16,770
Hioki.

109
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,020
Let's go together.

110
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,840
- Let's go. - Okay.

111
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,840
- Let's go. - Okay.

112
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,900
Come on, let's go.

113
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:35,260
Alright, please line up with your classes.

114
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:39,970
Class 5 is over here!

115
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,680
Okay, next up...

116
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:47,040
we're going to play a video of some
of the highlights from the field trip.

117
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:50,840
Oh! If you can't see the
screen well, feel free to move.

118
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:56,950
Hioki.

119
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,530
What should we do? Should we move too?

120
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,880
Huh?

121
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,620
The back...

122
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,390
Let's watch from the back.

123
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,510
Sure.

124
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:06,560
Let's do it then. Come on, come on.

125
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,890
- Let's go.
- Hey, wait.

126
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,649
Oh, sorry, I can walk on my own.

127
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:13,550
Watarai.

128
00:08:13,551 --> 00:08:15,550
Here, this is... for you.

129
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,140
Sorry.

130
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,320
It's fine. Stay like that.

131
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:34,820
Alright then...

132
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:35,900
It's starting.

133
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,200
(Kazamino High School
School Trip Memories)

134
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:42,450
Ooh.

135
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:43,470
Here it comes.

136
00:08:46,566 --> 00:08:50,166
The teacher's so cute!

137
00:08:58,730 --> 00:08:59,730
Aren't we...

138
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:01,490
a little too close?

139
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:09,290
Or rather,

140
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:14,150
right now am I using the most
handsome guy at school as back support?

141
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,980
- Hey, that's us.
- That's right.

142
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,920
Ugh, wait, I look so bad.

143
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:27,149
This is awful. What's with that face?

144
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,350
Give me a break.

145
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,310
Since we're friends,

146
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:36,350
this should be okay, right?

147
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:39,190
But...

148
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,340
if Watarai's fans saw us like this...

149
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,630
I can't see if you
keep fidgeting like that.

150
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,290
If this keeps up, my life will...

151
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,300
What do you mean?

152
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,080
Oh no!

153
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,580
What are you doing?

154
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:33,780
There.

can return to the classroom for self-study.

156
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:41,210
Oh, the reflection section...

157
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,710
You need to fill out at least 80% of it.

158
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,880
A reflection, huh?

159
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:53,350
Oh, are you writing something?

160
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:54,890
No, not yet.

161
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,160
I see.

162
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,520
Um...

163
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,410
Oh, Tsujitani!

164
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,790
Sorry, I'm borrowing Hioki for a sec.

165
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,770
Can you please stop staring at people?

166
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,580
He got borrowed.

167
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,820
Tsujitani...

168
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,696
- You were in a group with the Four Heavenly Kings...
- What's with that reaction?

169
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,080
I can't even deal with it anymore.

170
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,520
I'm so bummed out...

171
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:40,670
Seriously.

172
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,060
By the way, who was that just now?

173
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,230
Tsujitani. He went to my junior high.

174
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,010
And those guys over there,

175
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,040
I think they're all on the badminton team.

176
00:11:50,853 --> 00:11:51,853
Huh?

177
00:11:51,886 --> 00:11:53,326
Hioki's on the badminton team?

178
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,960
Oh, yeah.

179
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,309
Wait, he's in a sports club?

180
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:57,340
That's pretty surprising.

181
00:11:58,170 --> 00:11:59,170
It is.

182
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,150
Right, Watarai?

183
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,160
Oh, yeah.

184
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:07,170
I've been playing since junior high.

185
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:09,269
Whoa, you can play?

186
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,270
What the hell?

187
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,830
- That was so nerve-wracking.
- What?

188
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,180
What's wrong?

189
00:12:14,181 --> 00:12:15,650
It's not what's wrong with us.

190
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,080
It's you.

191
00:12:17,081 --> 00:12:19,960
Please stop hanging out in a
place that's so hard to approach.

192
00:12:22,038 --> 00:12:22,604
Wow.
Ahh...

193
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:25,780
That's true.

194
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,820
It does take a bit of
courage to go over there.

195
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,010
More than a bit...

196
00:12:31,963 --> 00:12:33,920
Look, my hands are still shaking.

197
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:36,510
Is it that bad?

198
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:38,059
I mean, if you're that nervous,

199
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,426
then we should all go
together for moral support.

200
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:40,450
No, no, no, no, no!

201
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:41,690
Don't be ridiculous.

202
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,880
The three of us...

203
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,480
Combined...

204
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:45,690
our power level...

205
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:47,150
is only around 30.

206
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:48,450
Yeah.

207
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:49,330
Even if you add Hioki,

208
00:12:49,331 --> 00:12:50,720
our power level is only 20.

209
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,080
- How did it go down?!
- Huh...

210
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:53,670
- Don't "huh" me.
- Huh...

211
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,166
Anyway, forget that. What's up?

212
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:58,590
- Why'd you call me here?
- About the club...

213
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,670
Oh, right, right, right, right. That's it.

214
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:01,830
No, I mean...

215
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,750
it's about passing out the club souvenirs.

216
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,850
- I wanted to figure out who's doing what.
- I see.

217
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:09,980
By the way,

218
00:13:09,981 --> 00:13:11,740
you've gotten really close to them.

219
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:13,030
The Four Heavenly Kings.

220
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:15,940
Yeah, I guess.

221
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:18,780
- I guess you could call us friends...
- Friends?

222
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,680
- Seriously?
- Friends?

223
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,620
- I think so...
- Friends?

224
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,060
You...

225
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,610
You've totally become
one of the popular kids.

226
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:30,596
I'm so jealous, you wannabe cool kid.

227
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,580
Whoa, that's a little harsh.

228
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:36,010
Alright, okay, it's done.

229
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:46,940
What do you think?

230
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:48,610
Hey.

231
00:13:48,611 --> 00:13:49,811
Watarai, are you done writing?

232
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,100
Hey.

233
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Watarai.

234
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,600
Are you okay?

235
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,500
- Are you okay?
- Hey.

236
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,540
You okay?

237
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:08,070
- Sorry.
- What took you so long?

238
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:09,310
Sorry.

239
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,320
Huh?

240
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:14,250
Oh, I handed in your
notebook already, is that OK?

241
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,480
Oh, sorry. Thanks.

242
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,500
- No problem.
- Thank you.

243
00:14:16,501 --> 00:14:18,500
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- Thanks.

244
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,700
Oh, and also,

245
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:22,590
the teacher asked me
to help lock up and clean.

246
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:25,279
Hioki, can you check the second floor?
Let's split up.

247
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,110
- Got it.
- Yeah, thanks.

248
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,970
- I'm heading up.
- Mmm-hmm.

249
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:32,700
- Come on, you come too. - No, no.
- Why not?

250
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,800
Hioki.

251
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:36,710
I'll go with you.

252
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,411
What were you guys
talking about just now?

253
00:14:55,435 --> 00:14:56,030
Huh?

254
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,070
With your club friends.

255
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,080
Oh, nothing important.

256
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:05,310
Just about the club souvenirs.

257
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,740
Why do you ask?

258
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,370
It's nothing.

259
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,660
Watarai.

260
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:23,490
What's up with you?

261
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,540
Nothing.

262
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,890
I was just a little curious.

263
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,840
You just looked like you were having fun.

264
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,540
What's that supposed to mean?

265
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,400
Don't tell me you're jealous.

266
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:45,050
Yeah.

267
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,600
Huh?

268
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:51,339
- Did you really write that?
- The guy is full of it.

269
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,840
- I just thought it was funny.
- I could never write that.

270
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,390
Being jealous of your friends.

271
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:00,820
Is that wrong?

272
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:06,260
It's not that it's wrong...

273
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,260
No.

274
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:17,490
Am I wrong?

275
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,100
For me,

276
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,500
actually...

277
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,700
Hioki, Hioki, Hioki!

278
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,750
Look, a new racket.

279
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:35,049
You bought another one?

280
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:36,210
You're such a gearhead.

281
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,790
Hey, don't knock it.

282
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,380
I'm telling you, this thing is light.

283
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,080
Before we became friends,

284
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,580
I was always...

285
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,490
I was always so impatient

286
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,000
about the distance between us.

287
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:03,190
Watarai? Are you okay?

288
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:10,050
Huh?

289
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:14,730
Why are you hugging me all of a sudden?

290
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,300
- Just for a little bit...
- Huh?

291
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:22,250
Because I'm lonely.

292
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,890
Let me stay like this
for just a little longer.

293
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:34,950
What?

294
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,280
This...

295
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:37,530
feeling...

296
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:42,860
Ah...

297
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:43,930
Um...

298
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,700
Watarai.

299
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:48,710
Hioki.

300
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:52,770
Where are they?

301
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,266
Then again, it's not like
you were really looking.

302
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:56,290
I was...

303
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:59,850
Come on... You're so unreliable.

304
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:02,610
Hey...

305
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:06,810
Do friends...

306
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:08,790
do this kind of stuff?

307
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,300
I would.

308
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,190
Is that wrong?

309
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,260
It's not that it's wrong,

310
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:27,050
but... isn't that a little long for a hug?

311
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,880
Only with Hioki...

312
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,700
You...

313
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:48,520
- What about kissing a friend?
- Wait... what?

314
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,060
Well...

315
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,560
that kind of thing...

316
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:53,010
you can't do that.

317
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,720
That kind of...

318
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:56,820
That...

319
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:59,350
What's gotten into you all of a sudden?

320
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,600
It's nothing.

321
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,490
I won't do it. Yet.

322
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,550
Yet...?

323
00:19:21,586 --> 00:19:22,586
What do you mean by that?

324
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,640
But I've said it now.

325
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,280
Huh?

326
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,600
That we're not just friends.

327
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:35,220
Hey, there he is.

328
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,860
Hey, what are you two doing?

329
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,100
Sorry, I'll be right there.

330
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,460
I'm going ahead.

331
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,330
Okay, I'll leave the rest to you.

332
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,520
What the...

333
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:52,550
is going on?

334
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,340
That just now...

335
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,600
What took you so long?

336
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:02,690
Sorry.

337
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,260
What were you guys doing?

338
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,110
It's a secret.

339
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:08,910
Hey.

340
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,560
What? What is it?

341
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:11,870
Now I'm curious.

342
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:13,670
It was nothing.

343
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:16,810
Hioki just got tangled up in some cords.

344
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,576
It just took a minute to sort out.

345
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,810
Oh, so it was just a little accident.

346
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:26,400
Anyway, are we going anywhere after school?

347
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,540
It's so hot. I'm craving some ice cream.

348
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,780
Oh, should we go to a
family restaurant then?

349
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,230
And make some plans?

350
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:33,530
Plans for summer break.

351
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:36,790
- Yeah, sounds good. - Yeah, yeah.
- Summer break.

352
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:40,010
- The beach, the beach!
- The beach!

353
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,560
Before that,

354
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:42,820
we still have finals.

355
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:44,630
I don't get it.

356
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,830
I don't get what Watarai is thinking.

357
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:52,850
Summer break is coming.

358
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,200
Let's just forget about it for now.

359
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,300
Let's go then...

360
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:59,470
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!
- Let's go study.

361
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:03,350
- Let's go, the beach is waiting for me.
- My beach is waiting.

362
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:11,660
We're friends,
but I don't understand him at all.

363
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,560
Hioki.

364
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,420
- Oh, let's hurry.
- Sorry, sorry.

365
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,810
Four months into my sophomore year,

366
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,390
still riding the high from the school trip

367
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,600
and exhausted from final exams,

368
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,690
our long-awaited

369
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,270
summer break had finally arrived.

370
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:56,420
Anyway, today's plan was to
go to the beach with everyone.

371
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:58,230

00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,166
(So Hot, Our Love is Heating Up Fast?)

382
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:58,090
Huh?

383
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,420
- The ice is melting...
- Ah.

384
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,980
