1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:02,960
Aww, he's so cute.

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,160
So what's Hioki-kun to Watarai-kun?

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,560
Being asked that directly...

4
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:11,450
What does Watarai...

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,020
think is so great...

6
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:15,370
about me?

7
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:19,290
Huh?

8
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,040
Wait...

9
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:23,110
Where's Hioki?

10
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:25,680
- Don't tell me he's lost.
- Mommy... Where's Mommy?

11
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:28,950
Hioki.

12
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:36,920
Mommy... Where's Mommy?

13
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,740
Oh, look. Is that her over there?

14
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,970
Well... where else might your mommy be?

15
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:45,710
Try to think.

16
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,400
Oh... right.

17
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,349
I have to contact the others.
Hold on a second, okay?

18
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:52,250
No... Hold me.

19
00:00:52,251 --> 00:00:53,320
- Oh... Sorry, sorry...
- Hold me...

20
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,140
Sorry, let me just get my phone...

21
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:57,090
- No... No!
- Ahh! Sorry, sorry, sorry...

22
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,290
Okay... Okay, just calm down...

23
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:02,890
I have no choice.

24
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,340
I'll have to take him
to the information desk.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,200
So, did you have fun today?

26
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,500
I don't know.

27
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:11,530
You don't know!

28
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:12,810
You don't know, huh?

29
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:15,410
There.

30
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:22,270
No good.

31
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,020
Still no answer.

32
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:26,240
I checked the restrooms, too.
He's not there.

33
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:29,770
I don't see him over here either.

34
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,770
I'm gonna go look for him.

35
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,890
Call me if you find anything!

36
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:43,000
"School Trip: Joined a Group I'm Not Close to"

37
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,700
(Episode 3)

38
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,670
Everyone's probably already gone back...

39
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,380
I hope I'm not causing
trouble for everyone...

40
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,300
Okay, let me just get my phone...

41
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,220
- Got him.
- Ah... Sorry about that.

42
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,240
Alright.

43
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,520
Hioki...

44
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Where are you?

45
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,860
Mommy...

46
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:26,580
We're almost there.

47
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:32,270
Yes, the restaurant is over there.

48
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,220
Enjoy your meal.

49
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:35,570
Excuse me...

50
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:37,980
This child seems to be lost.

51
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,040
He seems to have fallen asleep.

52
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,780
Oh, you're right. I'll watch him for a bit.

53
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:45,210
No!

54
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:46,660
Sorry, sorry.

55
00:03:46,661 --> 00:03:48,560
- No!
- Hioki.

56
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,030
Watarai!

57
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:53,650
What are you doing here?

58
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,970
I couldn't get in touch with you, Hioki...

59
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,470
I was worried...

60
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,490
You came looking for me?

61
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,380
I couldn't find you anywhere...

62
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:10,410
I thought maybe...

63
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:11,710
you'd be here.

64
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,220
I'm sorry! I...!

65
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,540
No...

66
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,480
I'm just glad you're okay.

67
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,230
By the way,

68
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:20,530
that kid...

69
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,140
He seems to be lost...

70
00:04:22,577 --> 00:04:25,047
But he starts crying
whenever I try to put him down.

71
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,380
This...

72
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,160
That's so cool.

73
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:39,130
- Mommy bought it for me.
- I see.

74
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:44,280
- Your mommy is so nice.
- Yeah. Where's my mommy?

75
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:47,790
I'm sure she'll be here soon.

76
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,716
Right now, your mommy is probably...

77
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:52,259
- looking all over for you.
- Really?

78
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,260
Yeah.

79
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,740
So, come on.

80
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,360
Here we go...

81
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:01,800
You're being so brave.

82
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:03,950
Did you cry?

83
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,260
That's amazing...

84
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,660
Yu-kun!

85
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,060
Mommy!

86
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,800
I'm so glad you're okay.

87
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:17,460
Thank goodness...

88
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:20,626
Don't run off like that again, okay?

89
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:21,650
Promise me?

90
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,380
I'm so sorry about all this...

91
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,600
Um...

92
00:05:30,601 --> 00:05:31,670
I didn't tell you guys...

93
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,659
I told you, you don't have to apologize.

94
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,660
But...

95
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,870
The fact that you were missing, Hioki,

96
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,840
I didn't tell the teachers either.

97
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:41,990
It's just that I...

98
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,360
was really worried.

99
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:45,790
It's not a big deal.

100
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:49,430
Even so, I still caused
trouble for everyone...

101
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,970
It wasn't exactly trouble...

102
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,080
I was definitely freaking out, though.

103
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,160
But as long as you're okay,

104
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:05,730
that's all that matters.

105
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,190
Why...

106
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:12,910
Huh?

107
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,130
Why is Watarai...

108
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:20,810
so kind to me?

109
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:24,810
Hioki?

110
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,780
I'm too scared to ask.

111
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,240
But I want to just come out and ask.

112
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,080
Let's go.

113
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,270
Yeah.

114
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:41,790
Watarai... what do you...

115
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,200
like about me?

116
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:56,430
This time, really...

117
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:58,260
I'm so sorry, everyone.

118
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,560
Hey, don't worry about it!

119
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,390
Why are you apologizing anyway?

120
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,070
Helping a lost kid is a good thing!

121
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:06,650
But...

122
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,920
If anything, it was perfect timing.

123
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,400
We wanted to take a break anyway.

124
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,500
Thank you.

125
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,780
Besides, something fun happened.

126
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:18,140
Huh? What?

127
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,690
Watarai was totally panicking.

128
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:21,191
Oh yeah, totally.

129
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:23,790
- For real!
- He was on a whole other level of worried.

130
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,500
- And then he just took off running!
- Yeah.

131
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,390
Well, what was I supposed to do?

132
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,160
- I was seriously worried!
- It was super...

133
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:39,610
- I'm sorry to you girls, too.
- Huh?

134
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,320
Oh, no.

135
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,860
It's fine with us...

136
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,230
Right?

137
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:47,020
Yeah, don't worry about it at all.

138
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:49,290
However...

139
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:51,750
In exchange, you could
do something for us...

140
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,210
There's actually...

141
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,520
a place we want to go.

142
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,400
(Cursed Hospital)

143
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:16,620
- Do you have the courage to face the truth?
- A ghost appeared.

144
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,520
I see...

145
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:25,090
- Whoa!
- No, no, no.

146
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,510
- Whoa!
- That looks so scary!

147
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:31,719
Well, I can probably guess...

148
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,370
why the girls wanted to come here.

149
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,960
Hey, it's so scary! Guys, come with us!

150
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,450
Sure.

151
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,200
But you girls have to lead the way.

152
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,950
This guy never changes...

153
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,680
But still,

154
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,120
this atmosphere...

155
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,680
is actually pretty scary, isn't it?

156
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,160
Hey!

157
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,190
If it gets really scary,
can I hold on to you?

158
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,760
- Absolutely not.
- Hey, you guys...

159
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:00,930
Hioki.

160
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:02,010
Aren't you scared?

161
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:04,770
Huh? Me...?

162
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,500
No, I'm not.

163
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,120
If you do get scared,

164
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,370
do you want to hold hands?

165
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,040
No... I'm okay.

166
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:23,980
I see.

167
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,080
Aah!

168
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,000
You've got to be kidding me.

169
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,940
Ah! Wait... Hold on...!
No way...

170
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,040
Everyone...

171
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:12,380
Man... What is even happening?

172
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,160
If I'd known it was this scary,

173
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:17,990
I should've just... held Watarai's hand.

174
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,990
Ah... Is that you, Watarai...?

175
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,580
Watarai...

176
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,050
Asking someone to hold my hand...

177
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,730
is just too embarrassing.

178
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:39,910
But you know...

179
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:41,580
Watarai's hand...

180
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,060
is so big.

181
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,660
Hioki... Are you okay?

182
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,030
Watarai... is in front of me?

183
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,430
Which means...

184
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:54,930
this hand is...

185
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:01,530
Aah!

186
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,450
Please come again.

187
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,310
We've been waiting for you.

188
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,180
- That was terrifying.
- Holding hands with a mummy...

189
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:17,290
- That's hilarious!
- Right? By the way...

190
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,910
I never knew Hioki could be so loud.

191
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:20,930
Tell me about it! His scream...

192
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:22,730
- was the scariest part.
- I know, right?

193
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:24,590
Sorry.

194
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,970
I should have been next to you.

195
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:30,140
No, it's really okay...

196
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,190
I can't believe a mummy
stole you away, Hioki.

197
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,870
What do you mean, 'stole away'?

198
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,100
Besides, you guys were all...

199
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,410
scared to death, weren't you?

200
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:40,850
That's true.

201
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,210
Hotta was about to cry.

202
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,669
What?! I was not!

203
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,970
- Yes, you were!
- Hey... guys... where to next?

204
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
We only have about 15 minutes left...
Is there anything you want to do last?

205
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:51,590
We only have 15 minutes left.

206
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:53,730
Is there anything we
can all ride together now

207
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,670
without having to wait in line?

208
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,620
Oh, hey, how about that?

209
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:09,510
The carousel.

210
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,030
Whoa, what is this?

211
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:13,890
Ooh, I call this one!

212
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:18,090
- That one's so cute too.
- Which one are you picking? Have you decided?

213
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,540
- I guess I'll take this one.
- Yep, this is the one for me.

214
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,430
This makes me Napoleon!

215
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,076
- This one's so awesome.
- If you've picked one, just get on.

216
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,856
- Isn't this one adorable? It is, right?
- Adorable.

217
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,680
- Hey, yours is pretty cool.
- Cute, right? - So cute!

218
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,770
"The word impossible is not in my dictionary"

219
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,930
A carousel, huh?

220
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:55,630
Man, it's been a while.

221
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:00,530
Hioki.

222
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,660
Look over here.

223
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:03,210
Huh?

224
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,260
Oh.

225
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,200
It's a video.

226
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:13,810
Wait!

227
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,840
You should've told me.

228
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,280
Oh, in that case...

229
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:18,690
I'll take one too.

230
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,750
Okay, ready.

231
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:28,750
With you filming me,

232
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:30,900
it feels kinda embarrassing.

233
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,110
Why?

234
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:34,510
But you're so good-looking.

235
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,540
How about I film you instead?

236
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:44,650
- No... you don't have to film me.
- I have to!

237
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,760
Why?

238
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:52,330
Because for me,
having you is all I need.

239
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,540
Why?

240
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,240
What is it...

241
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:14,690
you...

242
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:21,030
like about me?

243
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:26,770
What is wrong with me?

244
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,820
Why did I say something so stupid?

245
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,100
Oh, wait... what I meant was...

246
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:33,530
Let's see.

247
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:35,430
I'm not really sure myself.

248
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,660
Huh?

249
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,230
Looks like he didn't...

250
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,220
think much of it.

251
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,840
You gotta take these one by one.

252
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,720
Spoken like a true big brother.

253
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,500
Tsukasa.

254
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,222
Tsukasa!

255
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,470
Help me with mine!

256
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:15,040
Do it yourself.

257
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,790
Aren't you the oldest son?

258
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:19,809
- Yup.
- That's no way for the oldest to act.

259
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:21,010
- Why not?
- Oh...

260
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,610
Talking about siblings, huh?

261
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:29,910
- What's that you're eating?
- I'm starting without you.

262
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:34,310
- It's coffee-flavored. There's no way you can finish that.
- Yes, I can.

263
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,440
- Digging in, meow.
- Meow.

264
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,030
Ugh, I can't even watch.

265
00:15:40,485 --> 00:15:42,085
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.

266
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:43,510
- Let's eat.
- It's good.

267
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,816
Oh, by the way... Watarai,
do you have any siblings?

268
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,350
Yeah, a younger brother.

269
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,720
He's really cute.

270
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,650
- He's only in first grade.
- First grade?

271
00:15:51,996 --> 00:15:52,996
So that means...

272
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:54,970
he's ten years younger than me.

273
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:58,590
That explains it.

274
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Huh?

275
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:02,930
Your hair

276
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,450
is a mess.

277
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,790
That easy sense of closeness...

278
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,040
That kindness...

279
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:10,300
It's all because he's an older brother.
That's why he acts that way.

280
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,960
So that's it.

281
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,430
So that's what this is about.

282
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,220
Hey! What's your problem?

283
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,440
Nothing.

284
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,790
It's none of your business.

285
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:21,910
What about you?

286
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:23,419
Don't you have any?

287
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,090
Siblings?

288
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,830
Oh, yeah! Two older sisters.

289
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:28,030
Oh...

290
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,560
That explains it.

291
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:30,870
Huh?
What?

292
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,620
Nothing.

293
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,700
It's nothing.

294
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,420
None of your business.

295
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:37,770
What's your deal?

296
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,476
Man, time is flying, isn't it?

297
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,500
The trip ends tomorrow.

298
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,150
I know, right?

299
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:48,230
It feels like it went by
in the blink of an eye.

300
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:49,740
Yeah, you're right.

301
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:51,640
The school trip.

302
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,980
It ends tomorrow.

303
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:55,800
But summer break is coming up.

304
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:00,140
Right! We said we'd all
go to the beach this year.

305
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:01,490
And do fireworks, too.

306
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:03,330
It's kinda crazy...

307
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,760
I was so nervous at first.

308
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:06,990
Oh.

309
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,086
Hey, we should come back
to an amusement park again.

310
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:10,110
Totally!

311
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,620
Let's all go again.

312
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:12,500
Yeah, let's.

313
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:16,070
Hioki, you'll have to get over
your fear of roller coasters first.

314
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,200
Huh... you think I can?

315
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:21,120
And you have to try the
haunted house again.

316
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:22,970
No... that's a hard pass.

317
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,960
Without realizing it,

318
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:28,500
we've gotten to a point where we
can just look at each other and smile.

319
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,306
There's no way I can
be satisfied with just this.

320
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:39,800
Tomorrow, I have to...

321
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:47,380
- Okay, let's check in.
- I'm so excited.

322
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,710
On the second day, we moved to a hotel...

323
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,880
Actually, there was a bit of a mix-up.

324
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:55,619
I'm so sorry... about your rooms.

325
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:59,700
There aren't enough beds. So... I'm
hoping you can all work something out.

326
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,020
Mr. Kokufu.

327
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:04,890
Yes, of course.

328
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,290
Yes, no problem.

329
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,530
Yes, it's fine.

330
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:10,220
- No problem at all. We've got it covered.
- Miss...

331
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,820
- Not a problem.
- But...

332
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,890
Yes, of course.

333
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,880
- How does this even happen?
- Seriously?

334
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,650
So, who's sharing with who?

335
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,960
I toss and turn a lot, so I'm out.

336
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,410
- Same here.
- What?

337
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,560
So...

338
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:31,690
How about it, should we
play rock-paper-scissors?

339
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,880
Actually, considering our heights,

340
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:40,340
wouldn't it be too cramped
for Watarai and Hotta to share?

341
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,640
Good point.

342
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,850
With two people in that bed...

343
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,130
It'd be...

344
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:46,490
So...

345
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:48,340
Um...

346
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:50,566
Why don't the pairs who sat
together on the bus just share?

347
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:51,590
Huh?

348
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,280
I mean, I'm...

349
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,580
I'm cool with it.

350
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:57,949
He actually agreed.

351
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:00,170
Oh, but it's up to Hioki.

352
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,330
Huh? Oh, uh...

353
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,620
I... I'm okay with it.

354
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,920
Seriously?

355
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,120
You sure?

356
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,100
Awesome!

357
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,310
Which bed?

358
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:12,890
I'll take this one.

359
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,890
Aww, then I'll take that one.

360
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,340
I'll take this bed.

361
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,360
For real?

362
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:21,540
Well... here we go, I guess.

363
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,420
Yeah.

364
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,650
We decided that pretty quickly, but...

365
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:02,950
it feels like...

366
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:06,260
this is a lot closer than I thought.

367
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:15,119
But we're both guys anyway,

368
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,770
so it shouldn't be a big deal.

369
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,880
You're gonna fall off
sleeping that close to the edge.

370
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:26,860
Yeah.

371
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:28,900
You're... right.

372
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,530
Even so, this is way too close, isn't it?

373
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:34,820
What is with him?

374
00:20:34,821 --> 00:20:37,301
Do all good-looking guys have a
weird sense of personal space?

375
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,570
Ugh, seriously.

376
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:40,920
I'm too nervous to sleep.

377
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,360
Back then...

378
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:04,470
Watarai...

379
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:06,710
What do you...

380
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:09,730
like about me?

381
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:15,860
I have no idea what the
right answer would have been.

382
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:17,910
But...

383
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:19,900
by the way,

384
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:22,910
why are you so protective of Hioki-kun?

385
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:27,910
Huh?

386
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,810
You guys weren't even
that close at the beginning.

387
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:38,590
Watarai-kun.

388
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:41,660
Hioki-kun...

389
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:44,110
What's so good about him anyway?

390
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,510
Hmm... how should I put it?

391
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:55,510
Everything about him.

392
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,360
But for now,

393
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,400
it's...

394
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,160
Wh-what?

395
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:20,010
A secret.

396
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,070
I'm not gonna

397
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:26,980
tell you that easily.

398
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,020
Good night.

399
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,050
Yeah.

400
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:34,830
Good night.

401
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,400
(Next Episode)
(It's the final day of the school trip.)

402
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,346
(My heart's racing seeing him in
that kimono...) Your hair is a mess.

403
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:00,620
There. All better.

404
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,643
(A new rival appears?!)
It really is you!

405
00:23:02,668 --> 00:23:03,668
You're here too?

406
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,900
What is this, some kind of hottie festival?

407
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,440
If you wouldn't mind...

408
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,360
would you like to... with me?
