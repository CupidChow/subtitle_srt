00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:04,000
(Four months ago)

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,900
(New Semester: 2nd Year Class Assignments)

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,680
No way.

4
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,870
Class 5 is stacked this year, huh?

5
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,496
- Seriously, the Big Four are all in one class.
- That's insane...

6
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,180
- I'll come hang out sometime.
- For sure.

7
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,880
They're good-looking.

8
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:40,540
They've got great personalities.

9
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:42,250
In every single way.

10
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,960
Sometimes I wish I was just a normal guy.

11
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:05,190
He's so handsome.

12
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,180
You're so lucky.

13
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:11,770
- I've used up all my luck for the year on this.
- He's seriously handsome.

14
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,050
Watarai-kun?

15
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,240
Huh?

16
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,360
Oh.

17
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,300
Hey.

18
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:21,950
I'm Nakasato.

19
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,800
Nakasato Haruki.

20
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:25,170
Yeah.

21
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,620
Hey.

22
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:30,170
Honestly...

23
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,440
it's kind of a pain.

24
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:34,490
Huh?

25
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,239
We've never even talked before,

26
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,256
and people are calling us
"The Big Four" or whatever.

27
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,130
Don't just lump us together
like we're the final bosses.

28
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,910
- Tell me about it.
- Right?

29
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,080
What are you doing?

30
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,229
That's...

31
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,330
my seat.

32
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,790
Oh, sorry.

33
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:02,120
Oh, I'm not mad or anything.

34
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,710
I was just born with this scowl.

35
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,850
Oh, Morisaki.

36
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:10,480
We're in the same class again.

37
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,580
Looking forward to it.

38
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,110
Huh?

39
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,520
Who are they?

40
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,120
Friends of yours?

41
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:19,960
Nah, no idea.

42
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:21,410
Who are they?

43
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,040
Hey, wait a sec.

44
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,150
We're supposed to be "The Big Four,"

45
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:30,280
but we don't even know each other's names.
That's pretty funny.

46
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,300
Well, whatever. I
don't really get it either.

47
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,140
I'm Hotta.

48
00:02:37,141 --> 00:02:39,110
- Nice to meet you.
- I'm Nakasato.

49
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,590
And...

50
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:41,850
this is Watarai-kun.

51
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,040
Just Watarai is fine.

52
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:45,890
Nice to meet you.

53
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,420
I'm Morisaki.

54
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:49,740
Nice to meet you.

55
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,660
Wait, what class were
you guys in first year?

56
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,780
- Class 3.
- Class 3?

57
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:54,589
Wait, wasn't what's-his-name in Class 3?

58
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:57,076
The guy who crashed his bike
into a tree and flew into a rice paddy.

59
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,676
Sato, the one who walked
away without a scratch.

60
00:02:58,700 --> 00:02:59,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

61
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,180
You know about that?

62
00:03:00,181 --> 00:03:01,620
- So crazy, right?
- You knew?

63
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,930
Back then, I had no idea.

64
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,770
That four months later...

65
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,500
I would confess my feelings

66
00:03:16,227 --> 00:03:18,007
to a boy whose name I didn't even know.

67
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,460
"School Trip: Joined A Group I'm Not Close to"

68
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,469
(Episode 7: The Encounter)
It all started...

69
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:25,860
with something completely trivial.

70
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,239
All right, I'm passing out the handouts.

71
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,940
Fill them out and pass them to the front.

72
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,500
Make sure you use a pen.

73
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,020
- Watarai, can I borrow your pen when you're done?
- Sure.

74
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:56,950
Here you go.

75
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,350
Thanks.

76
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:10,690
Huh?

77
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,360
Don't tell me...

78
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,850
A pen...

79
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,270
you didn't bring one?

80
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,880
I didn't.

81
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,640
Hold on.

82
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,030
You can borrow mine.

83
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,670
Are... Are you sure?

84
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:39,940
Go ahead.

85
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,930
- What's her deal?
- Right?

86
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,490
She could've just asked the teacher.

87
00:05:52,596 --> 00:05:54,066
- Totally.
- I know.

88
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,458
She could have at least
asked the person next to her.

89
00:05:55,482 --> 00:05:55,870
Exactly.

90
00:05:55,871 --> 00:05:57,739
- I would've just asked the person beside me.
- It's so weird.

91
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:01,130
- She's totally doing that on purpose.
- I know, she has to be.

92
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:05,999
- Anyone would just ask the person next to them.
- So lame.

93
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,480
I bet she has one in her pencil case.

94
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:09,430
Sorry about that.

95
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,230
Thank you.

96
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:14,810
Yeah.

97
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,140
In a situation like that...

98
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,510
what's the right thing to do?

99
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,780
Still, those four have it so easy.

100
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:39,320
They're playing life on easy mode.

101
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:40,580
I know.

102
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:42,170
Especially Watarai.

103
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,019
If I had his face...

104
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:46,640
I'd have, like, ten girlfriends by now.

105
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,750
For all we know, he probably does.

106
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:50,769
He literally just lent someone a pen...

107
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:52,610
and all the girls started freaking out.

108
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:54,690
Seriously. Life must be so easy for him.

109
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:00,370
This kind of thing has always happened.

110
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,480
I'm used to it.

111
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,390
But...

112
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,590
even so...

113
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,040
it doesn't mean it doesn't sting.

114
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,700
Oh.

115
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:14,010
Wait.

116
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:15,890
Don't we have our committee meeting today?

117
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,980
You're right... I completely forgot.

118
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,560
Oh, I have to go too.

119
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,370
What should we do?

120
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:23,790
You wanna head home first?

121
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,590
Nah, I'll just wait here for you guys.

122
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,076
All right, see you in a bit.

123
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,020
- We'll hit you up as soon as we're done.
- Okay.

124
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:39,600
So, how's the new class?

125
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,626
You've got those "Big
Four" guys in there, right?

126
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:42,650
Oh yeah.

127
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,409
- We do.
- And?

128
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:46,010
So are they as popular as everyone says?

129
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:47,530
Here we go again.

130
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,020
Well, I've never actually
talked to them, so...

131
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,950
Hioki's not exactly the
type to start a conversation.

132
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,050
Hioki?

133
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,720
Who's that?

134
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,230
Anyway...

135
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,020
What's Watarai like?

136
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,540
What terrible timing.

137
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,850
I just told you, I've never spoken to him.

138
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:12,040
Come on, even so, you must
have some kind of impression, right?

139
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:15,790
Like, does he seem cheerful or gloomy?
Just your first impression...

140
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:17,590
Let's see...

141
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,250
How do I put this...

142
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:22,740
I know I shouldn't be eavesdropping.

143
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,220
He seems... nice, I guess.

144
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,270
Really?

145
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:30,530
That's kind of surprising. Why? Tell me.

146
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:32,990
It's nothing, it's just...

147
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:35,310
he lent his pen to a girl who forgot hers.

148
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:37,270
Huh?

149
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:39,000
Huh? That's it?

150
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:41,270
That's the most useless
piece of information ever.

151
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:42,110
Aww...

152
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:44,716
- How is that interesting?
- I was hoping his parents were celebrities or something.

153
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,976
- Or that he was dating some influencer.
- What a stereotype.

154
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,050
But, I mean...

155
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:50,910
- Everyone says stuff like that.
- I don't really get it though.

156
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:51,730
But from what I saw...

157
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:53,750
he's just a genuinely nice, normal guy.

158
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:57,940
You're so pure.

159
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:01,530
- That's what's great about this dummy.
- Hey!

160
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,210
It's pretty much her only good quality.

161
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:05,050
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

162
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,540
Club practice, club practice!

163
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,680
Hey!

164
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:09,590
- We're screwed.
- We're screwed.

165
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:13,260
- I don't wanna get yelled at by the whole team!
- No one's gonna yell at you!

166
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,110
It was the first time...

167
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,920
a guy had ever complimented
me on my personality.

168
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,350
And...

169
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,010
it was from someone
I'd never even spoken to,

170
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,400
praising me when he
thought I wasn't listening.

171
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:55,990
Hioki...

172
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:58,690
Asahi...

173
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:04,930
It was something so small...

174
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:07,090
but to me...

175
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,650
it brought me a
happiness I'll never forget.

176
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,230
From then on...

177
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,550
at first, I just...

178
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,560
wanted to talk to him.

179
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,400
- Watarai-kun, good morning.
- Morning.

180
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:30,749
- Watarai-kun, you're so popular!
- Whoa, that's amazing.

181
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,270
Are all of these love letters?

182
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:33,370
But...

183
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:34,890
the more I became aware of him...

184
00:10:34,914 --> 00:10:35,914
Thanks, everyone.

185
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,940
The harder it became
to find the right moment.

186
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:43,810
Here he comes. Hioki.

187
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:48,510
Okay, here I go... Hioki.

188
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,680
Behind you, behind you! Hurry!

189
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,540
Whoa!

190
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,880
Come on!

191
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,240
Next one!

192
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,720
Excuse me!

193
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,186
Could you throw the ball down?

194
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:08,210
Please!

195
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,700
Tsujitani, get up!

196
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,560
What are you even doing?

197
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,630
Before I knew it...

198
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,850
I couldn't even manage
to say "good morning."

199
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,400
A whole month had passed just like that.

200
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,676
(School Trip Group Assignments)
All right, first off...

201
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,340
I need you to get into
groups of three to five.

202
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:36,250
Once you've formed your groups...

203
00:11:36,251 --> 00:11:40,080
- Please write your members' names on
this sheet. (I hope this can be my chance.)

204
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:41,690
All right, then.

205
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:42,710
You may begin.

206
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,600
Amusement Park.

207
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,620
Okay, I got the sign-up sheet.

208
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:55,386
The teacher said to write our
names on this and turn it in.

209
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:57,806
(School Trip Group Sign-up)
Thanks. Can you write my name down for me?

210
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:59,560
- Write mine down too.
- OK.

211
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
My chance.

212
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:04,070
This is it.

213
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,520
Hm? What did you say?

214
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,300
Oh, it's nothing.

215
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:09,670
Oh, by the way,

216
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:12,020
what's the max number
of people for a group?

217
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,010
Um, I think it's five people max.

218
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:16,010
In that case,

219
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,780
can we add one more person?

220
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,760
Huh?

221
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,779
It's just that...

222
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:22,780
Like, for example...

223
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:25,290
Hioki-kun.

224
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,150
Hioki-kun?

225
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,460
Who's that?

226
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,680
Huh? Are you close with Hioki-kun?

227
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:36,290
No, I'm not...

228
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,970
I've never actually talked to him.

229
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,120
Right.

230
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,500
I know this is sudden.

231
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,620
Me asking this out of the blue.

232
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,520
- Sorry, never mind...
- Sure.

233
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:52,310
Huh?

234
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:53,990
I mean...

235
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,880
what's one more person, right?

236
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:58,440
I'll go get him.

237
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,320
Huh? Really?

238
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,710
Yeah, Hioki-kun and I went
to the same middle school.

239
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:04,130
I'll go ask him.

240
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,320
Hioki-kun, have you decided on a group yet?

241
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:10,290
I never thought

242
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,740
things would go this smoothly.

243
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,240
No, but...

244
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:17,679
- what will Hioki-kun say?
- Okay.

245
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,710
- Then it's settled.
- Wait.

246
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:23,830
Hioki-kun says he'll join our group.

247
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:26,230
- No, I...
- Just kidding.

248
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:28,290
Seriously?

249
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:29,870
Ah.

250
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,180
Um...

251
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:33,050
Watarai-kun,

252
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:36,170
right?

253
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,460
Are you sure you want me in your group?

254
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,140
Yeah.

255
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,080
By the way,

256
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,430
you can just call me Watarai.

257
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:46,310
I talked to him.

258
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,250
For the first time.

259
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:50,290
Oh.

260
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,050
This is Nakasato-kun and...

261
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,480
Morisaki-kun.

262
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,680
Nice to meet you.

263
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:56,370
Nice to meet you.

264
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,770
So, it's settled then?

265
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,120
Huh?

266
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,030
I'm grateful,
looking forward to it.

267
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,260
Just like that,

268
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:18,290
I was in the same group as
my crush for the school trip.

269
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:41,610
At first, all I wanted...

270
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:43,090
was to talk to him.

271
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,160
Okay.

272
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,790
Sitting next to him,

273
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:54,530
little by little,

274
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,890
as I got to know Hioki-kun,

275
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,680
that simple feeling

276
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,740
of just wanting to talk to him.

277
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,780
Wow.

278
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:08,970
Began to swell every time we grew closer,

279
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,560
growing bigger and bigger.

280
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:20,630
So? Think you and Hioki-kun
can become good friends?

281
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,060
Huh? What do you mean?

282
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,140
Because...

283
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,820
you asked him because you
wanted to be friends, right?

284
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,100
I mean, there's no other reason, is there?

285
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:33,900
Well...

286
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,480
I guess,

287
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:45,180
I want to know more

288
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:47,270
about Hioki-kun.

289
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:50,930
My name is

290
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:54,050
Asahi.

291
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,390
That's so cute.

292
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:01,950
The more I learned about him,

293
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:04,260
the more endearing I found him.

294
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,040
I really like it.

295
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,140
Gradually, I started wanting more.

296
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:11,020
Because I'm lonely.

297
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,670
Just let me stay like this a little longer.

298
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:17,260
Before I knew it,

299
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,490
I was already hopelessly...

300
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,350
You like him, don't you?

301
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,250
Asahi...

302
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,910
It's totally obvious.

303
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,560
We're in the same boat.

304
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,020
Even so,

305
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:39,880
I was scared to say
these feelings out loud.

306
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,170
You're not going to tell Asahi?

307
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:48,750
Probably not.

308
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,580
It would just make things awkward for him.

309
00:16:58,980 --> 00:16:59,980
I see.

310
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,860
And yet, I...

311
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:14,150
So, in other words,

312
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,440
Watarai,

313
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,180
do you have feelings for me?

314
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,960
I...

315
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:27,280
like you, Hioki-kun.

316
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:35,090
Um, as in,

317
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,360
I mean,

318
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,400
uh...

319
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,630
in a romantic way.

320
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,320
Yeah.

321
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:55,050
I'm sorry.

322
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:57,390
I didn't mean to say it.

323
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,760
This must be weird for you.

324
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,040
You can just forget about it.

325
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,040
Ah.

326
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,480
I'll go get a cold towel.

327
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:07,900
I knew it.

328
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,400
I shouldn't have said anything.

329
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,950
Wait.

330
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,240
Sorry.

331
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,400
Um.

332
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:27,650
I've...

333
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:29,430
never

334
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,880
been in a relationship before.

335
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,460
No one's ever

336
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,860
confessed to me,

337
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,550
and I've never confessed to anyone.

338
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:41,750
When it comes to romance,

339
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,170
I don't get it at all.

340
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,740
Even though I don't understand it,

341
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,240
the feeling of liking someone

342
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,040
is...

343
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:53,810
something anyone is free to feel.

344
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:56,590
Watarai,

345
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:58,790
the fact that you like me,

346
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,320
I don't think there's
anything wrong with that.

347
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,020
I guess I support you?

348
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,940
No, that sounds weird, doesn't it?

349
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,140
Um.

350
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:11,130
Huh?

351
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:14,740
Anyway,

352
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:17,970
I'm not bothered at all.

353
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:23,910
Wait, so,

354
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,540
you're not bothered by it?

355
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:27,550
Right.

356
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,860
Being with you is fun, Watarai.

357
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,140
And I feel comfortable around you.

358
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,560
But whether those feelings

359
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:40,150
are romantic or not,

360
00:19:40,151 --> 00:19:42,240
I have no idea.

361
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:45,330
So,

362
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,080
I can't give you an answer right away.

363
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:51,900
But even so,

364
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,860
I want to think about this seriously.

365
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,880
Hioki-kun.

366
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,360
So,

367
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,280
it might take some time,

368
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,350
but my answer...

369
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:10,080
could you wait for it?

370
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,150
Of course.

371
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,460
Hioki-kun is...

372
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:19,330
the one I fell for.

373
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,780
He's always so pure.

374
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,360
He just honestly...

375
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:27,120
looks right at me for who I am.

376
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,090
Can I just

377
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,500
keep liking you?

378
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,740
Yeah.

379
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,520
Thank you.

380
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,400
In that case,

381
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,520
I don't have to hold back anymore.

382
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,640
Huh?

383
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:00,750
Wait,

384
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,340
what did you just say?

385
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,170
I said I won't hold back anymore.

386
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:11,240
So you'd better be prepared.

387
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:20,170
Prepared for what...?

388
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:22,200
What... what do you mean?

389
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,040
I'm going to show you
just how much I like you.

390
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,700
I'm going to make it clear.

391
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:37,550
Make it clear...

392
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,209
No, but before that,

393
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:43,550
- you might start to hate me, Watarai...
- Impossible.

394
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,050
I'll make my feelings for
you clear all over again.

395
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,070
You don't have to rush your answer.

396
00:21:58,930 --> 00:21:59,930
Okay.

397
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:03,540
Oh.

398
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:05,770
By the way, are you feeling okay?

399
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,100
Are you alright now?

400
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,580
I think so.

401
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,430
I see.

402
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,600
That's good.

403
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:20,860
Hey, you alright?

404
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:23,630
We're good.

405
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,540
We're on our way.

406
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,830
Alright, let's go.

407
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:31,020
Okay.

408
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,580
Anyway...

409
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:38,100
Until you're of age, Hioki,
you are not to drink with anyone but me.

410
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,840
- Why not?
- Just because.

411
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:41,326
What about people you know, Watarai?

412
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,350
Nope. Not even them.

413
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:43,760
No way. Absolutely not!

414
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,800
If you're ever going to
drink with other people,

415
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,930
you have to let me know first.

416
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:50,980
Got it.

417
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,000
I can't drink either...

418
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,916
(Next Episode) (Fall Culture
Festival) When you get all shy like that...

419
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:56,940
I love that, too.

420
00:22:58,090 --> 00:22:59,980
- Then marry me.
- Huh?

421
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:02,610
(Sudden School Confession?!)
Please.

422
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,300
I'm serious. I really like you.
