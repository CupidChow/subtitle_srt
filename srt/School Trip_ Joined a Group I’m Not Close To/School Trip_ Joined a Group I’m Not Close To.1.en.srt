(Kazamino High School)

2
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:41,690
Right now,

3
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:45,170
I'm facing a major problem.

4
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:51,710
(School Trip Group Assignments)

5
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:56,380
It's only been two months
since we started our second year.

6
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,900
I'm doomed.

7
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:07,470
In this class,

8
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,870
I don't have a single friend.

9
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:18,090
The school trip everyone's been looking forward
to is just around the corner.

10
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:25,460
Seriously, why are we having a school trip in June?

11
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:29,460
The teachers are totally overestimating
a high schooler's social skills.

12
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:31,780
Okay, first things first.

13
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:34,540
Get into groups of three to five,

14
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:38,990
then write your members' names
on this sheet and turn it in.

15
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,790
Okay, begin.

16
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,410
W-Wait a second.

17
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,770
I'm done for. What am I supposed to do?

18
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,030
Hioki, have you found a group yet?

19
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,390
If you haven't decided,

20
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,620
why don't you join us?

21
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,160
Huh?

22
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,570
It's Hotta... from junior high school.

23
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:05,830
That said,

24
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,840
we never interacted at all back then.

25
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:09,530
Why is he asking me?

26
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:11,530
So?

27
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,740
Are you in a group already?

28
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:14,700
Uh, no. Not yet.

29
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,210
Great, it's settled then.

30
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:17,150
Huh?

31
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,050
Wait, wait. Why me?

32
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,770
By the way, the other members are...

33
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,550
Huh?

34
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:25,890
No way...

35
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,970
I've never even spoken to any of them.

36
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:29,650
Come to think of it...

37
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,050
These four...

38
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,080
Aren't they...

39
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:38,320
the most popular group in the entire school?

40
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,240
No, no, no, no. No way, no way, no way.

41
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,200
Absolutely not.

42
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,830
A super elite group of handsome guys
where every single one of them is tall...

43
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,640
There's no way a regular guy like me could fit in...

44
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,200
Hioki's joining our group, too.

45
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:51,510
No, I haven't...

46
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:53,540
I haven't even agreed to anything.

47
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:55,370
And honestly,

48
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,960
they don't look like they want me here at all, do they?

49
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,300
Um... everyone looks kind of uncomfortable.

50
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,160
Isn't there some kind of misunderstanding?

51
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,630
Huh? Everyone agreed to it.

52
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,120
No, they didn't.

53
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,630
Uh, but I've really never talked to any of you...

54
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,140
Hey, since it's decided, can I write down the names?

55
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:17,280
- Oh, yeah!
- Hey, are you even listening to me?

56
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,700
U-Um...

57
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:25,290
Uh...

58
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,560
I think...

59
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,000
his name is...

60
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:34,880
Watarai... right?

61
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,010
Is it really okay? For me to join?

62
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,040
Yeah.

63
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:40,850
By the way, just call me Watarai.

64
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,840
Oh, and these two are Nakasato

65
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,490
and Morisaki.

66
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,630
Nice to meet you.

67
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:48,330
Nice to meet you.

68
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,810
So, we're all set then, right?

69
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:52,690
Huh?

70
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,380
Oh...

71
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,040
Um...

72
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:05,360
Nice to meet you.

73
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,320
Two months into my second year of high school,

74
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,620
on the school trip,

75
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:17,490
I got stuck in the worst group.

76
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,000
"School Trip: Joined a Group I’m Not Close to"

77
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,500
(Episode 1)

78
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,470
So the day has finally come.

79
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,200
Hey, Hioki!

80
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,400
Hioki.

81
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:33,670
Tsujitani...

82
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,450
You're full of energy this morning.

83
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,120
Huh? You're in a group with the "Big Four"?!

84
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:43,230
Why?

85
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,410
I'd like to know that myself.

86
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,340
I've practically never met them before...

87
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,350
The only one I've spoken to is Hotta.

88
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:53,100
Hotta went to our middle school.

89
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:57,210
That guy's a social butterfly who can get along
with anyone, young or old, male or female.

90
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,040
You know what I'm talking about.

91
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,470
Yeah, I know.

92
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:00,770
In contrast,

93
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,470
Morisaki Naoya can seem a little hard to approach.

94
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,270
But for the girls,

95
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:07,700
his cool demeanor is what makes him so charming.
It just sucks you in.

96
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,730
What?

97
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,920
Sucks you in?

98
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,690
Nakasato Haruki is the classic "cute" type.

99
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,500
He's really friendly.

100
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,020
Like a pop idol?

101
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,890
Yeah, but...

102
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,140
as expected,

103
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:26,850
the one who's by far the most popular

104
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,250
is Watarai Tsukasa.

105
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,490
Look.

106
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:34,790
He's a refreshing, handsome guy with no bad angles.

107
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,160
He's basically a walking soft drink commercial.

108
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,680
For real.

109
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,140
Oh.

110
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,250
He noticed us.

111
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,080
He's looking this way.

112
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:57,120
Should I wave or something?

113
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,720
Ah.

114
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,900
He's coming over.

115
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,090
Huh?

116
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,220
- What do I do...?
- I'm outta here.

117
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,700
- Huh?
- Good luck.

118
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,980
Hey, wait...

119
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,040
Morning.

120
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,320
Uh... ah...

121
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,230
Morning...

122
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,440
Good morning.

123
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:19,400
This one's looking handsome this morning too.

124
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,660
Was that your friend just now?

125
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,060
Oh, yeah.

126
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:24,650
From middle school...

127
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:25,700
We were in the same club.

128
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:27,570
I see.

129
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:34,710
Did you sleep well last night?

130
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,540
Uh...

131
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,030
I was a little nervous, so I didn't get much sleep.

132
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,250
I see.

133
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,440
This is so awkward.

134
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,800
Hey.

135
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,400
Over here!

136
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:50,730
We're gathering up.

137
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,150
Let's go then.

138
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:53,650
Yeah.

139
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,620
Morning.

140
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,700
- Morning.
- Morning.

141
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,080
How should we sit on the bus?

142
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,570
Hey, where are our seats?

143
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:07,130
Let me see.

144
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,250
Here and...

145
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:10,290
here.

146
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,310
Huh?

147
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:12,920
I don't want to sit here.

148
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:14,190
It's next to a girl.

149
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:16,620
I knew you'd say that.

150
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:20,510
That's why I said from the start
that the five of us should sit in the back row.

151
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,230
But then we wouldn't be able to hear everyone else talking.

152
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:24,240
Just deal with it then.

153
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,300
- I don't know...
- Then how about you sit next to her, Hotta?

154
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:27,650
- They're arguing over something so stupid.
- Why me?

155
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,150
Is it that bad?

156
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,460
Sitting next to a girl.

157
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,350
Let's play rock-paper-scissors for it.

158
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,750
Ah...

159
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,560
Please, let me sit here.

160
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,200
Um...

161
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,950
- No, no, over here.
- Um...

162
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:40,650
I can take that seat.

163
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,750
Huh? Seriously?

164
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:43,950
Are you sure?

165
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:45,750
Yeah, I don't mind where I sit.

166
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:48,270
Are you a god? Thanks!

167
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:51,220
I'll sit next to Hioki then.

168
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:52,820
Huh?
Okay.

169
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:54,430
We'll take these seats.
Is that okay?

170
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,540
Oh... yeah.

171
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,480
I'll sit here then.

172
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,640
Please return to your seats.

173
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:10,850
Although...

174
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:14,150
I wouldn't have minded sitting next to a girl.

175
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,710
She's definitely thinking,

176
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:24,030
"Why is it this guy?"

177
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,250
Sorry about that.

178
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,570
That you're not sitting next to a handsome guy.

179
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,710
Oh, sorry.

180
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,820
It's okay.

181
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,670
By the way, if it feels cramped,

182
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,200
you can lean on me.

183
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,270
No, that's okay.

184
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,480
Thank you.

185
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:45,810
Still,

186
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:46,910
if you were going to say all that,

187
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,170
I really wish you'd just switched seats with me.

188
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:58,260
We'll be taking a 20-minute break.

189
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:02,520
Please be back by 10:45.

190
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,160
10:45. Take care.

191
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,300
Hioki.

192
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,920
You can sit up front for the next leg of the trip.

193
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,260
Huh?

194
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,490
Watarai said you looked uncomfortable
sitting in the middle.

195
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,700
So he suggested it.

196
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,460
Watarai did...?

197
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:37,310
Hey, seriously?!

198
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,410
Oh my God, they're really here!

199
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,020
Is that really them?

200
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,380
This is insane!

201
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:45,060
Huh? Does everyone know them?

202
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,660
No, they must be fans from someone's Instagram.

203
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:48,590
Huh?

204
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:50,920
Probably Watarai's or Morisaki's.

205
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,950
They have the most followers, after all...

206
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,840
Come on, your numbers aren't that different.

207
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,280
What? Yes, they are.

208
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,850
- I only have around 25,000.
- What?

209
00:10:58,850 --> 00:10:59,880
25,000?

210
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:01,110
That's a lot, isn't it?
Is it?

211
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,450
Huh? But those two have way more, right?

212
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:05,560
Huh?
Look.

213
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,340
These are Nakasato's numbers.

214
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:09,300
Huh?

215
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,260
Watarai.

216
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,770
Yes.

217
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:14,370
And these are Morisaki's.

218
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,490
Huh!

219
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,550
Um...

220
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,520
Are you guys celebrities or something?

221
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,110
No way.

222
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,160
It's pretty normal for regular people
to have this many followers, right?

223
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:24,830
Is... that so?

224
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,820
Oh yeah, Hioki, let me get your handle too.

225
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:28,130
Your IG.

226
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,510
Huh? Oh...

227
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:31,010
I'm not really on it.

228
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:31,970
Huh...

229
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,360
Huh?

230
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,380
Uh... sorry?

231
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,620
Feeling sleepy?

232
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,740
Yeah, a little.

233
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,230
You can sleep for a bit.

234
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:06,930
I'll wake you when we get there.

235
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,660
No, it's...

236
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,100
Um...

237
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,110
Thank you.

238
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:28,900
Hioki...

239
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,260
We're here.

240
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:31,890
Wake up.

241
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,150
Hioki.

242
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,020
Oh, crap...

243
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,180
I-I'm so sorry!

244
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:45,000
It's fine.

245
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:48,000
What horrible crime did I commit...

246
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:51,380
to fall asleep on the shoulder
of the most popular guy in our year?

247
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:53,570
I'm really sorry.

248
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:54,950
I must have been heavy, huh?

249
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,010
By the way,
did I wrinkle your clothes or anything...?

250
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,540
No...

251
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,070
Don't worry about that.

252
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:07,010
Huh?

253
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:09,850
Wha... What is it?

254
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:19,110
Your hair...

255
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,600
is messed up.

256
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:24,870
Thanks...

257
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,680
Whoa, this is amazing.

258
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:43,050
Is this outer space?

259
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:45,550
- Oh, there's a map.
- Huh?

260
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,340
We're here right now...

261
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:49,290
Hey, this is pretty cool, huh?

262
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:52,500
Wow, so cute.

263
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,900
Ah...

264
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,220
Wanna take a picture?

265
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:01,480
Hioki, you get in too.

266
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,060
Come on, hurry.

267
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,430
Come on, get over here...

268
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,310
Closer, get closer.

269
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:08,580
Okay, ready? Smile!

270
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:11,020
Hey, let's take a picture everyone!

271
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:13,360
Okay, smile!

272
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:21,630
What are you doing?

273
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,850
Hey, that looks good.

274
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:28,050
Let's see the cool astronauts.

275
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:28,900
Let me see.

276
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,720
Whoa.

277
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:36,370
He's super tall, isn't he?

278
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:39,420
When we first got grouped together,
I was worried how it would turn out.

279
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,090
More than I expected...

280
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,740
I'm glad it turned out to be more fun than I thought.

281
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,570
Hey, did you see the Big Four' IG?

282
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:48,550
Totally. They're all ridiculously good-looking.

283
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,840
But doesn't Hioki look out of place
in there?

284
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,880
Yeah, but Hioki is always alone.

285
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,410
- They probably just felt sorry for him and invited him, right?
- You think so?

286
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,410
Watarai and his friends are so nice.

287
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:01,150
But honestly,
I wish he wasn't in the picture.

288
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:01,850
I know, right?

289
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,160
Hioki just seems...

290
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,870
like he's got some nerve, you know?

291
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:09,950
Yeah, totally.

292
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:13,580
To just hang with the Big Four like that.

293
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:14,500
Whoa.

294
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,730
It's starting to rain.

295
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,780
What should we do?

296
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:23,300
Anyone bring an umbrella?

297
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,350
I don't.

298
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,270
Me neither.

299
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,060
What about you, Hioki?

300
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,320
Uh...

301
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:30,630
I didn't bring one either.

302
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,620
Sorry.

303
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,960
Ah...

304
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,340
And we have to walk back to the hotel.

305
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:38,330
Hey.

306
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,880
I got us an umbrella.

307
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,060
Huh? How'd you get it?

308
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,210
Some random guy gave it to me.

309
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:45,780
Your social skills are on another level.

310
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:47,590
Can we all share it?

311
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,530
Oh, don't worry about me.

312
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,110
Huh...

313
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,140
I'll head back later.

314
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:54,790
You guys go on ahead.

315
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:56,550
But what about you, Hioki?

316
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:59,510
Me? My club members are over there.

317
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,300
I'll be fine.

318
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,750
- Well, let's go then.
- Yeah, okay.

319
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:05,580
- Let's go.
- Okay.

320
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:17,700
Hurry, hurry.

321
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,700
Whoa, it's really coming down.

322
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,620
Let's run for it.

323
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,760
Whoa.

324
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:37,790
Huh?

325
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:39,450
Oh.

326
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,060
My contact lens fell out...

327
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,890
Oh, right, my glasses.

328
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:58,180
My glasses are in my suitcase...

329
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:02,110
Hioki.

330
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,540
Huh?

331
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,460
Watarai? What are you...?

332
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,340
I just couldn't...

333
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:16,590
I was kind of worried about you.

334
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,380
What's wrong?

335
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,380
Huh? Well...

336
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,880
I accidentally dropped my contact lens.

337
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:25,470
What?

338
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,680
Whoa, are you okay?

339
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:28,930
Yeah.

340
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,570
Things feel a little weird...

341
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:31,690
But I'm okay.

342
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,490
- Huh?
- Let's go.

343
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,120
Huh...?

344
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,780
What is this...

345
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,560
What is happening?

346
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,040
I feel like everyone is staring at us.

347
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:36,940
Groups that have their room keys,
please proceed to the banquet hall immediately.

348
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:39,210
It says we have to go to the banquet hall first.

349
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:40,940
What should we do?

350
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,800
But aren't our bags already in the room?

351
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,880
Hioki, isn't it hard for you without your glasses?

352
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,740
Yeah.

353
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:50,510
I'll go ask the teacher.

354
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:52,770
I'm... I'm sorry.

355
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,310
I'm really sorry about today.

356
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:07,100
You went out of your way to invite me to your group,

357
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,240
and I've just been causing trouble from the start...

358
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:11,210
You don't have to worry about that.

359
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:14,100
I don't think you're any trouble.

360
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:16,860
- But...
- Besides, I actually...

361
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:22,280
Never mind. It's nothing.

362
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:24,780
Huh?

363
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,400
Is this it?

364
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,310
Thanks. I'll go grab them.

365
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,700
Be careful not to fall.

366
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,480
Did you find them?
Yeah.

367
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:38,530
Sorry for the wait.

368
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,160
Whoa!

369
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,040
I messed up.

370
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,380
Ugh, what am I even doing?

371
00:20:50,404 --> 00:20:51,404
I'm sorry...

372
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Ah...

373
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,620
Are you okay?

374
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,700
Ah... Yeah.

375
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:03,430
I'm okay.

376
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,860
That's good.

377
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,910
I just told you to be careful not to fall, didn't I?

378
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,880
Huh?

379
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:16,190
He's not mad.

380
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:18,230
If anything...

381
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,640
it's the opposite...

382
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:23,480
Are you sure you're not hurt?

383
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:26,370
What is...

384
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,400
this feeling?

385
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:42,290
I can't...

386
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,280
I feel like... I just...

387
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:47,600
I'll do anything if you'll just forgive me.

388
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:56,710
Oh?

389
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,340
Anything, you say?

390
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:00,190
Huh?

391
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:08,800
Uh, well, right now... W-Wait a second.

392
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:13,710
Th-That...

393
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:15,740
Can you just forget what I just said?

394
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:16,750
Nope.

395
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:17,870
An instant no?!

396
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:19,150
Wait, what did I even say?

397
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:20,750
I said I'd 'do anything'?

398
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,480
Watarai wants me to...

399
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:24,020
do what?!

400
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:25,170
Um, well...

401
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,560
What's going to happen to me?

402
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,500
Who knows?

403
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,540
I'll think about it.

404
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,400
By the time this school trip...

405
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,060
is over.

406
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:41,450
On the very first day of the school trip,

407
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:45,470
things already seem to be getting out of hand.

408
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,180
(Next Episode)
Hey, I heard you held hands with Watarai Tsukasa.

409
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,080
So cute.

410
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,000
(A naked date with the hottie squad.)

411
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:02,240
(The first night together...)
Let's talk about love.

412
00:23:02,541 --> 00:23:03,715
(As the two of them get closer...)
You're not the type

413
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:04,970
who, when you fall for someone,

414
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:06,570
ends up falling way too hard, are you?

415
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:07,830
Give me a break.
