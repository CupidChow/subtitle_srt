1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:02,499
Excuse me.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,319
There aren't enough beds for everyone.

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,269
Hope you don't mind squeezing in a bit...

4
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:09,510
The two of you were bus
buddies, right? Just share a bed.

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:10,640
Huh...

6
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:12,590
Well, I...

7
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:13,940
It's fine.

8
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,200
Is he...

9
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,500
closer than I thought?

10
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,900
But we're both guys, anyway.

11
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,320
It shouldn't be a big deal...

12
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:25,650
You're so close to the
edge. You're going to fall off.

13
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:26,540
What the heck?

14
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:29,021
Do all handsome guys have such
a weird sense of personal space?

15
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,530
It's cold.

16
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,880
Ah...

17
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,450
I can't seem to settle down.

18
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:55,070
Hioki.

19
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:56,490
Oh, sorry. Did I wake you?

20
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:00,790
He's talking in his sleep.

21
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:10,220
Huh? What should I do?

22
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,700
If I move, I'll probably wake him up.

23
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:16,470
Huh.

24
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,190
But somehow...

25
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:22,940
Watarai's body...

26
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:24,990
is so warm.

27
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,330
No, no, what am I even thinking?

28
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,390
But...

29
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,500
Watarai's asleep, too.

30
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:48,260
Just for a little while...

31
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,260
Anyway...

32
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,710
it's not morning yet.

33
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,420
I'll just stay like this for now.

34
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:00,010
(Day Three of the School Trip)
Ugh... I'm starving.

35
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,820
Mmm, this is good.

36
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,520
Ah.

37
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,020
Mm.

38
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,620
Hmm? You awake?

39
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:13,030
Oh, everyone's up.

40
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,030
I should go wash my face.

41
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,500
Huh?

42
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,460
Come to think of it...

43
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:25,190
Last night...

44
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,210
Did I just...

45
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,520
fall asleep like that?

46
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:34,780
Oh, well...

47
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,790
Watarai doesn't seem to mind.

48
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,560
So it should be fine, right?

49
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,480
Achoo!

50
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:42,170
Bless you.

51
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,149
That's so mean.

52
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,100
Ripping off the covers to wake someone up.

53
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:47,500
I had no choice.

54
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,550
The alarm went off and
you guys didn't get up.

55
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,630
Ah.

56
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:54,130
Ugh.

57
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,410
It's freezing.

58
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,640
What a horrible way to wake up.

59
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:03,250
You're so gentle with Hioki.

60
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,510
What's next, is he gonna ask for a hug?

61
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,320
Hey.

62
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,870
It's not like that.

63
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,580
Mm.

64
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:34,590
Hioki.

65
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,110
What was that...

66
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,020
all about?

67
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:50,120
Hey.

68
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:51,890
Alright.

69
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,290
Today is... oh!

70
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,060
Right, what are we doing?

71
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:58,020
We're going to a temple or something...

72
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,580
- Mmm.
- Oh...

73
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:02,229
- And a kimono experience.
- A kimono experience.

74
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:02,900
A kimono experience.

75
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:04,840
Ah! Then I'll have to do my hair.

76
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:07,460
Just borrow Nakasato's flat iron.

77
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,550
Okay.

78
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,440
Handsome guys really are...

79
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,520
on another level when it comes to style.

80
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,180
I'll do yours, Hioki.

81
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,590
Huh?

82
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,640
Hmm?

83
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,920
- Oh.
- Mmhmm!

84
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:22,500
"School Trip: Joined a Group I’m Not Close to"

85
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,630
Is it okay if I use some hair wax?

86
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:29,930
Yeah.

87
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:31,550
It's not itchy?

88
00:05:31,574 --> 00:05:33,256
(Episode 4)

89
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,380
Nope.

90
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,600
Mmm, this scent.

91
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,400
It's the one I usually use.

92
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,880
Ah...

93
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:57,290
Don't tell me you don't like it.

94
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,080
I like it.

95
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,050
That's a relief.

96
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,190
Mm.

97
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:11,530
Alright, you'll have
free time starting now.

98
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:15,590
This is the last stop on our school trip.

99
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,299
Everyone,

100
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,260
make sure you have fun.

101
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:30,709
Hey, guys...

102
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:31,910
Are you ready yet?

103
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,470
As expected of the Four Heavenly Kings.

104
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:59,020
They really are on another level.

105
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:05,310
- Sorry for the wait.
- Looks great.

106
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,870
So that's the color you chose, Hioki.

107
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,520
- It really suits you.
- Not bad, not bad.

108
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,240
Ah, Hioki.

109
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,600
Look here.

110
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:13,840
Your hair is a mess.

111
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,400
Mm.

112
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,800
There, all better.

113
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,600
Thanks.

114
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,750
Alright~

115
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,150
Shall we get going?

116
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,260
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

117
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,500
Let's go.

118
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,290
- The air is so fresh.
- It's nice.

119
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,539
- Let's take a group photo here.
- Good idea.

120
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,540
Okay, smile.

121
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:43,390
This one turned out nice.

122
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:45,730
That one's amazing.

123
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:49,550
Ah...

124
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:53,500
- This water wheel is cool.
- It really is.

125
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:55,950
Okay, smile.

126
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,920
- Ooh, nice one.
- Yeah, that's great.

127
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,590
- Okay?
- Perfect.

128
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:04,650
So good.

129
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,300
This is delicious.

130
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,980
- Yum, this kusamochi is so good.
- So good, so good.

131
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,540
Huh...
So sweet.

132
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:14,310
You want this one?

133
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,410
Ah, mm.

134
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,240
You've got something on your face.

135
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,670
There, got it.

136
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:30,490
Thanks.

137
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,780
Mmm...

138
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,040
Yummy.

139
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:35,610
Oh.

140
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:39,130
Do you want to offer some incense...?

141
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:41,590
- I don't have any change.
- I do.

142
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,750
Huh...

143
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:43,880
- Really?
- Need some?

144
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,230
- Can I borrow some?
- Sure.

145
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:47,170
Thanks. I'll pay you back.

146
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:48,290
I'll buy you a juice later.

147
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,790
- Any one is fine?
- Anything.

148
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:52,770
And then,

149
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,100
this smoke,

150
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,050
is for purification.

151
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,550
And then,

152
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,520
you wave it over your whole body like this.

153
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,680
Okay...

154
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:04,750
Okay, what's next?

155
00:09:07,563 --> 00:09:09,203
Looks like they have fortunes over there.

156
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,320
Cool, wanna try?

157
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,720
I want to.

158
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,020
Oh, then let's all draw one and...

159
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:16,070
let's make it a competition.

160
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,080
A competition for what?

161
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,700
Isn't it obvious?

162
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,100
We'll see who

163
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,500
has the best luck.

164
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,330
Let's settle this.

165
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:28,300
- Alright, bring it on! I'll definitely win!
- I won't lose either.

166
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:31,940
There's no way I'm gonna lose.

167
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,680
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!
- Let's do this.

168
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,060
- I'm ready.
- Okay.

169
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:41,750
Here we go! Yeah!

170
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:43,100
Ready, set, go!

171
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:44,650
Yes!

172
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,700
Great Blessing.

173
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:49,470
- Great Blessing, not bad.
- Blessing.

174
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,630
Ugh, No Blessing.

175
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,790
Hioki got the worst one?

176
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,840
Yeah.

177
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,470
So, what's it say?

178
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:01,610
It's Small Blessing.

179
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:04,170
"The person you await will appear."

180
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:05,980
No way.

181
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:09,640
Let me see yours too, Hioki.

182
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,150
Mm.

183
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,510
Here.

184
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:13,630
Mine too...
Thanks.

185
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:16,730
Yourself... what was it?

186
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:20,220
"The person you await..."

187
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,780
"Believe in yourself."

188
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:25,660
That's ridiculous.

189
00:10:25,661 --> 00:10:29,290
Who would ever turn down
a confession from Watarai?

190
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,200
Um, if you don't mind...

191
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,370
could I take a picture?

192
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,090
Sure.

193
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:51,440
- Thank you.
- Go-go ahead.

194
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,060
Wow...

195
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,770
What a scene.

196
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,080
Asahi?

197
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,819
I knew it was you, Asahi.
You have a totally different vibe now.

198
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,030
I almost didn't recognize you.

199
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,500
Anna?

200
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,800
Thank you. Aw, how cute.

201
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,070
Excuse me for a second.

202
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,390
Hioki.

203
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:19,570
Sorry to keep you waiting.

204
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:20,740
No, it's fine.

205
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,016
You had your hands full back there, huh?

206
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,040
Not at all.

207
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,920
Um...

208
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:25,940
Is she a friend of yours?

209
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,429
Um... she's a friend from middle school.

210
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:28,820
We went to the same middle school.

211
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,430
He's so hot.

212
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,709
- Huh?
- Anna, you said the quiet part out loud.

213
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:36,610
No way... I'm so sorry.

214
00:11:36,634 --> 00:11:37,516
Anna...

215
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,380
Um... we went to the same middle school.

216
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:42,100
- Back in seventh grade...
- What are you guys doing?

217
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,270
Is this some kind of hot guy festival?

218
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,110
Huh?

219
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:50,510
Hotta-kun?

220
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,500
Oh, it's Ikegaya.

221
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,820
Wait, Ikegaya, you're on a school trip too?

222
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:56,860
Yeah.

223
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:57,560
For real?
By the way...

224
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:01,630
Are you and Hotta-kun that close, Asahi?

225
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,040
Asahi.

226
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:06,740
Oh, no, not at all.

227
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:09,130
We only just got to know
each other on this trip.

228
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:10,580
Oh, I see.

229
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,750
- So...
- What?

230
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:15,650
What's the deal here?

231
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,560
Who are all these handsome guys anyway?

232
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:19,630
Hey, spill the details.

233
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,150
Ugh...

234
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,560
I have a feeling this is
going to get complicated.

235
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:29,170
Oh.

236
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,320
Excuse us.

237
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,670
We're running out of time.

238
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:33,990
Right?

239
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:35,330
Oh, it's time.

240
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:36,850
Alright then.

241
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:39,490
See ya.

242
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:40,870
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

243
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,070
Asahi!

244
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,980
- I'll message you later!
- Okay, got it.

245
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:58,100
Mmm, this is so good.

246
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,200
Good, right?

247
00:12:59,310 --> 00:12:59,840
- It's delicious.
- Nice.
I want some too.

248
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:01,470
I want to try it.

249
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,640
- Nakasato, take a picture for me.
- Sure.

250
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:06,639
That girl from before...

251
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,510
Could she be the one from
Hioki's middle school days?

252
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,109
The girl everyone thought he was dating?

253
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:11,620
Yeah.

254
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

255
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:17,250
Yeah, they did seem pretty close.
They were on a first-name basis.

256
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,810
- Salty? Or soy sauce?
- This is soy sauce.

257
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,950
Whoa, are you buying that many?

258
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,860
- They all look so good.
- That's way too many.

259
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,440
This one is really good too.

260
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:27,490
Here, try it.

261
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,889
- Delicious. I'll take this one.
- Here you go.

262
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:30,890
Here, have a bite.

263
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:31,990
Here.

264
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,550
Open up.

265
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,520
Mmm.

266
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:36,820
- How is it?
- Delicious...

267
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,480
- I think I'll buy one too.
- Thank you, right this way.

268
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:40,730
Oh, excuse me, thank you.

269
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,080
Tsukasa, bro...

270
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,390
feed me too.

271
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,840
UWu

272
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,280
No way.

273
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:49,870
Me too, me too!

274
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:52,600
Hey, don't copy my little brother.

275
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,210
Then I want some too.

276
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:56,440
- Just eat it yourself.
- Nah, just kidding.

277
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,130
Huh? You were faking?

278
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,410
Couldn't you tell?

279
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:04,010
- My bad.
- Feed me.

280
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:06,560
- I told you to stop.
- Big bro.

281
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:09,800
(Maneki-neko keychain)

282
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,020
Oh no, we're out of time.

283
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:12,890
Look at this.

284
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:14,630
Oh, shoot.

285
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:16,739
We only have ten minutes
until we have to meet up.

286
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:17,780
Hurry, we gotta go.

287
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:19,230
Ugh...

288
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,510
I can't.

289
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:22,190
I'm so tired. I've hit my limit.

290
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:24,549
I've been in these wooden clogs all day.

291
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,590
My feet are killing me.

292
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,150
Ah.

293
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,620
- Come on, hurry up.
- I'm getting dizzy too.

294
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,979
- Let's get going.
- Pull me, please.

295
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,579
It's hard to walk pulling you like this.

296
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,700
Just hold my hand.

297
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:37,160
- Okay.
- Okay.

298
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,230
Me too, then.

299
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:40,710
Huh?

300
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:41,910
Here, then...

301
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:43,170
This side too.

302
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:44,530
What are you doing?

303
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,700
Yep, holding hands.

304
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,770
Alright, let's all go together then.

305
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,450
What is even happening?

306
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:52,940
I don't know.

307
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:56,460
- But it's not so bad.
- This is so embarrassing.

308
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,700
Feeling lonely?

309
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,770
- Oh, sorry, thank you.
- Here.

310
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,070
Yeah.

311
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,200
A little.

312
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,470
Because I had so much fun.

313
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,230
Me too.

314
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,760
Um...

315
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,080
Yeah?

316
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:34,590
Back at the temple...

317
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:36,400
That girl we met.

318
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,370
Oh, you mean Anna?

319
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:40,990
Yeah...

320
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:43,980
Um...

321
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:45,730
Hioki...

322
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,630
Are you two close?

323
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:50,610
Well...

324
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:52,940
We were close in middle school.

325
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,930
But we haven't really kept
in touch since graduating.

326
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,920
Why do you ask?

327
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,140
Oh...

328
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,600
It's nothing...

329
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:03,950
Um...

330
00:16:06,603 --> 00:16:08,393
I guess... never mind.

331
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,570
Oh, right!

332
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,870
Watarai, hold out your hand.

333
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,680
Huh? Why?

334
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,960
Just do it.

335
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:24,610
Here.

336
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,050
This is for you.

337
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:27,730
Huh? For me?

338
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:29,190
Yeah.

339
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,180
- Can I open it?
- Yeah.

340
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:36,570
Huh? Why?

341
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,370
How should I put this...

342
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,180
You've been such a huge help

343
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:45,480
these past three days.

344
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,220
It's just a little something to say thanks.

345
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,790
It's almost time.

346
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:03,470
Oh.

347
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,500
And look.

348
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:07,100
Didn't you say you have a little
brother in elementary school?

349
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:09,250
If you don't want it...

350
00:17:09,275 --> 00:17:10,615
- You can give it to him.
- No.

351
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,760
I'm keeping this for myself.

352
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,500
Okay.

353
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:15,370
Thank you.

354
00:17:17,233 --> 00:17:18,663
No, thank you.

355
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,350
Tsukasa bro...

356
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:22,070
Huh?

357
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,630
Oh, sorry. I was just copying the others.

358
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:25,860
You don't like it?

359
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:27,570
No.

360
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,680
It's not that.

361
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:31,390
You can just call me by my first name.

362
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:32,790
Huh?
Just your first name?

363
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,820
Call me by my first name.

364
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,920
Tsukasa?

365
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:47,110
Actually...

366
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,740
On second thought, my last name is fine.

367
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,830
What do you mean, "on second thought"?

368
00:17:58,603 --> 00:18:00,003
Alright everyone...

369
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,790
For these last three days,

370
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:03,200
you've all done very well.

371
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,930
Since this is a school trip, please
go straight home and don't wander off.

372
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,050
Please get home safely.

373
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,190
We're heading back this way.

374
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,480
- Bye-bye.
- See ya.

375
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,700
Hey, we're going the same way.

376
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:28,790
Are you heading home?
Oh, I'm...

377
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,890
My older sister is picking
me up around here.

378
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,320
Oh, I see.

379
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:37,170
Um...

380
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,860
Thank you.

381
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:43,850
For asking me to join your group.

382
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:45,940
I wanted to say it again.

383
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:49,280
I had a really great
time being in this group.

384
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:50,980
Glad to hear it.

385
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:52,770
Hearing you say that,

386
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:54,430
I'm really glad I asked you to join.

387
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,050
But, uh...

388
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,720
I wasn't actually the one who invited you.

389
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:01,010
Huh?

390
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,240
Yeah.

391
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,060
Watarai?

392
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:09,730
What is it?

393
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:13,330
I'd like

394
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,260
to speak with Hioki

395
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:17,550
for a moment.

396
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:27,230
Um...

397
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:30,220
About the first day...

398
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,680
Do you remember?

399
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:35,910
At the hotel...

400
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:38,170
When you went back for your glasses.

401
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:40,180
Huh? My glasses?

402
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:43,690
Oh...

403
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:44,860
Oh no.

404
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,770
I'll do anything, please forgive me.

405
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,250
It completely slipped my mind.

406
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,280
That whole thing...

407
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:55,170
So we're not past that yet, huh?

408
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:58,650
Yeah.

409
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,990
Of course, I remember.

410
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,000
Um, there's something...

411
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,240
I'd like to ask you.

412
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,500
Yeah?

413
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:10,470
Okay.

414
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:21,690
Have a seat.

415
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,120
Actually...

416
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,620
about the groups for the school trip...

417
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:36,750
the one who suggested
inviting you, Hioki-kun,

418
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:39,690
was me.

419
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:42,510
Huh?

420
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,600
But...

421
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,650
it wasn't because you're always alone,

422
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,610
or for any reason like that.

423
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,220
I just...

424
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,540
simply...

425
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,030
wanted to get to know

426
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,190
you a little better.

427
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:04,330
Why are you telling me...

428
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,560
this now?

429
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,010
Because we'd never really talked.

430
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:15,760
I didn't know anything about you.

431
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,970
I just genuinely wanted to talk to you.

432
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:21,770
At first,

433
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:24,140
that's really all it was.

434
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:27,470
At first?

435
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,900
But after actually...

436
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,900
spending time with you...

437
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,690
These past three days,
I've learned so much about you.

438
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,370
Your fun side,

439
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:50,340
your kind side,

440
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,330
and your slightly ditzy and cute side.

441
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,200
I like all of it.

442
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:03,490
Somehow...

443
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:05,950
this whole vibe...

444
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,440
it just...

445
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:11,530
made me want to get to know you

446
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,850
even more.

447
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,090
So...

448
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,620
if you'll have me...

449
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,200
please go out...

450
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:36,730
No way...

451
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:39,050
Is he about to confess to me?

452
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:43,290
With me...

453
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:54,700
(Next Episode)

454
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,106
(After the 3-day, 2-night school trip, )
Hioki...

455
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:57,136
(their relationship deepens.)
Let's go together.

456
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,730
I can't see if you keep fidgeting.

457
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:00,690
Excuse me, I'm borrowing
Hioki for a second.

458
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:03,650
(The spark of jealousy ignites.)
I'm so jealous. You two are so chummy.

459
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:06,360
Just let me stay like
this a little longer...

460
00:23:06,613 --> 00:23:08,723
You're Hioki Asahi, right?
