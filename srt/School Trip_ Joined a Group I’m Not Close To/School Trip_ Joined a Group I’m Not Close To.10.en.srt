1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:02,390
The winter of our second year.

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:05,280
Winter break starts tomorrow.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,350
We decided to have a Christmas party together.

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,120
Yeah.

5
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:21,680
Thanks.

6
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:23,150
Yeah.

7
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:34,150
Oh, sorry.

8
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,790
I almost kissed you just now.

9
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,240
Huh?

10
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,080
Hey, don't get carried away.

11
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,720
- Don't forget we're here too.
- Sorry.

12
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,960
I only had eyes for Hioki just now.

13
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:52,690
Sorry for the wait. I brought pizza.

14
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,910
- You brought a lot of stuff.
- I brought a bunch of things from home.

15
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:58,340
- We can play with them later.
- Which one? Which one?

16
00:00:58,580 --> 00:00:59,710
This one...

17
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,780
- Can we play this?
- Yeah, totally.

18
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,080
What's wrong?

19
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,060
Oh, it's nothing. It's just...

20
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,260
When I think about it, it's pretty amazing

21
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,230
that we're all hanging out like this.

22
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,600
That's true.

23
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,920
We all got super close
right after the culture festival.

24
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:23,250
Huh? What's this picture?

25
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:24,620
Oh, this?

26
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,530
I thought if everyone saw
a rare picture of Hioki from middle school,

27
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,690
you'd all get a kick out of it.

28
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,020
A rare picture...

29
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:32,550
What did you bring, Tsujitani?

30
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:33,840
What is it? What is it?
What kind of picture?

31
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:36,430
A picture of that rumored girl.

32
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,340
And stuff from middle school, like when we became
the badminton club's representatives.

33
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:43,080
- I'm confiscating this.
- Give it back! What's there to be shy about?

34
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,415
You're always so embarrassed.
You'll never grow if you don't embrace it.

35
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,520
What are you talking about?

36
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,650
What are you doing?

37
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:02,000
"School Trip: Joined a Group I'm Not Close to"

38
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,940
(Episode 10: Spring Breeze)
Let's set the table.

39
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:06,210
Over here.

40
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,810
Hurry, hurry.

41
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,310
Who wants orange juice?

42
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:12,820
Um...

43
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,830
About what happened earlier...

44
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,420
Are you mad at me?

45
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,060
No.

46
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:20,610
I'm not mad.

47
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:22,860
Why?
Look.

48
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,630
Before, whenever I was getting along with my friends,

49
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:28,130
you'd always...

50
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:30,370
I'm over that now.

51
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,240
I know you like me.

52
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,240
Besides,

53
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,590
I'm confident no one's going to steal you away.

54
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,470
I see.

55
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,430
It's good that you're not bothered by it.

56
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:52,170
However,

57
00:03:54,638 --> 00:03:56,400
to make sure that never happens again,

58
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,310
you have to stay by my side from now on.

59
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:02,790
Okay?

60
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,540
Those two are so lovey-dovey.

61
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,750
Hey, you two over there.

62
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,830
Come join the toast.

63
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,480
Oh, okay.

64
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,580
- Let's all take a picture!
- Okay!

65
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:19,960
Picture time, picture time! Everyone, get in here.

66
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,510
- Raise your glasses, raise your glasses.
- Okay.

67
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,860
- Closer, get closer.
- Okay, I'm taking it.

68
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,490
I'm sending this to Santa Claus.

69
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:31,250
Ready? Merry Christmas!

70
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,800
Cheers!

71
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,610
- Nice one.
- It's great, it's great!

72
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:42,580
Eat up.

73
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,430
Are you having fun?

74
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:47,560
- Yeah. - Glad to hear it.
- Hey, badminton club members...

75
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,510
So sweet.

76
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:55,370
Here, open wide...

77
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,800
- Is it good?
- He says it's pretty good.

78
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,860
I've practically started a revolution.

79
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,340
Okay.

80
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,380
Here we go.

81
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,600
Not bad.

82
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:35,630
Left foot.

83
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,250
Red.

84
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,890
- I'll help.
- Oh.

85
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:42,630
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

86
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,660
By the way, is this okay for today?

87
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,220
Huh?

88
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:46,900
What do you mean?

89
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,980
Well, you know.

90
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,720
It's Christmas Eve, after all.

91
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:54,200
I was just thinking you two
might've wanted to be alone.

92
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:55,730
Be alone?

93
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:57,750
Oh.

94
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,330
You mean me and Watarai?

95
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:00,610
Yeah.

96
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:02,330
I mean, look.

97
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:06,530
I've been trying not to ask, but...

98
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,480
um...

99
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:13,870
Yeah.

100
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:15,830
You two are dating, right?

101
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:18,550
Huh?

102
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,000
Sorry, is that a touchy subject?

103
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,300
Oh, no, it's not that.

104
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:25,090
Hmm?

105
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,590
I think...

106
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:29,040
I've just had a shocking realization.

107
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,410
Or rather, um...

108
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,430
We...

109
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:38,430
might not be dating.

110
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,760
We're not dating?

111
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:47,660
He definitely told me he likes me.

112
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:49,170
And I said it back.

113
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:51,080
But now that I think about it,

114
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,790
we've never actually talked about
whether or not we're dating.

115
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:58,840
Should I ask him about it?

116
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,710
'Are we dating?'

117
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,350
No, no way.

118
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,890
There's no way I could ask that.

119
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,340
Hioki...

120
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:08,810
Huh? Oh, yes!

121
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:10,230
Do you have a minute?

122
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,410
I'd like to talk to you alone.

123
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,160
Huh?

124
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:15,550
Oh.

125
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,700
Oh, okay.

126
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:28,850
Your hands must be cold.

127
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:30,370
Oh.

128
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,540
A little.

129
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:33,100
Here, take this.

130
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,480
Oh.

131
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:35,630
Th...

132
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:43,060
What should I do?

133
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,000
Maybe I really should ask.

134
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,480
But...

135
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:48,360
Oh, um...

136
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,180
Yeah?

137
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:53,630
Oh, it's nothing.

138
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,740
Um...

139
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,430
Oh, speaking of which, this place...

140
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:00,070
We came here on our way back
from the school trip, didn't we?

141
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:01,730
Oh.

142
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,600
Yeah.

143
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:06,460
Speaking of that,

144
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,510
didn't we draw fortunes that day?

145
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:10,630
Yeah.

146
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:11,930
My fortune,

147
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,980
do you remember what it said?

148
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,070
Hmm, what was it?

149
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:20,270
'Believe in yourself and move forward.'

150
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,920
What's that about?

151
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:24,130
It was actually pretty spot-on.

152
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,790
- Right?
- Yeah.

153
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,950
In fact, it's because I tried
to move forward after that

154
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:31,350
that I get to be here with you like this now.

155
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,650
Yeah, the gods really knew
what they were talking about.

156
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,400
But,

157
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,670
that part actually worries me a little.

158
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:43,590
Huh?

159
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,130
I might...

160
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,820
just keep rushing forward on my own.

161
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,430
And because I'm too hasty,

162
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:56,210
I might end up causing you trouble.

163
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,460
So,

164
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,720
if

165
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:02,940
I start to get out of control,

166
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:05,610
you have to stop me.

167
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,040
Out of control...

168
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:12,890
I want

169
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:15,420
to cherish you properly.

170
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,420
Oh, right.

171
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,810
I have something for you. Sit down for a sec.

172
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,390
Huh?

173
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,560
Okay.

174
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,430
Close your eyes first.

175
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:44,430
Okay.

176
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:51,970
You can open them now.

177
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:55,370
Huh?

178
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:57,560
Merry Christmas.

179
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:00,510
Thank you.

180
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:01,910
Go on, open it.

181
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:03,760
Ooh, I wonder what it is.

182
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,760
A watch...

183
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:19,770
Yeah.

184
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:22,500
I considered getting you jewelry or something,

185
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,150
but then,

186
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,100
they'd probably confiscate it at school.

187
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,750
So I figured,

188
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,260
something you could wear at school,

189
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:30,450
during club activities,

190
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,950
anytime, anywhere,

191
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,140
would be better.

192
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,800
Also,

193
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,460
to be honest,

194
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,430
if you wore it every day,

195
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:45,030
it would make me really happy.

196
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,340
Oh.

197
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,480
Just now,

198
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,300
was I being too intense?

199
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,800
I'm so happy.

200
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,240
It feels like Watarai

201
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:05,410
has always been by my side.

202
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:35,700
I'll leave it at this for today.

203
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:38,550
I'll just have to be patient.

204
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:44,770
Well,

205
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:46,090
maybe we should head back now.

206
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,280
Don't tell me...

207
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:57,650
I overwhelmed you again?

208
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,040
I don't think I'll ever

209
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:06,700
be a match for him.

210
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:08,790
Come on.

211
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,130
- Let's go.
- Okay.

212
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,100
Yeah.

213
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,420
Whether we end up together

214
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,020
or not...

215
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,360
Just being with him...

216
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:26,590
makes me feel like I could be this happy forever.

217
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,220
But...

218
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,700
Someday...

219
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:38,768
(Art Prep Room)

220
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,600
(3 Months Later)

221
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,040
- Come in.
- Excuse me.

222
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,280
Sir.

223
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,840
- I brought the class roster.
- Thanks.

224
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:07,480
This year

225
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,990
flew by, didn't it?

226
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:10,710
Yeah.

227
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:12,910
It was a lot of fun.

228
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:15,090
I'm glad to hear that.

229
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,470
When we were making the groups for the school
trip, I was actually a little worried about you.

230
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,080
Oh, that.

231
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:21,780
But,

232
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,610
thanks to that school trip,

233
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:25,220
I was able to make friends.

234
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:27,670
High school friends...

235
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,970
some you stay in touch with after you grow up,

236
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,330
and some you don't.

237
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:35,910
But you guys,

238
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,320
I have a feeling you'll all stay friends for a long time.

239
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:40,930
Yeah.

240
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
That's the plan.

241
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:46,760
But Hioki-kun looks so stiff here.

242
00:13:48,016 --> 00:13:50,920
- He's still the same.
- You just don't see it.

243
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,320
He's totally different now.

244
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:23,750
Hioki.

245
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,390
Here.

246
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:26,950
I just need you here, Hioki.

247
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,040
I...

248
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:30,420
like you, Hioki.

249
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:33,500
I like you. I really like you, Hioki.

250
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:46,350
You're home.

251
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,300
I'm home.

252
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:50,510
That was quick.

253
00:14:58,670 --> 00:14:59,870
We're going to be seniors soon.

254
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,220
Yeah.

255
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:05,610
Hey.

256
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:06,160
Hm?

257
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,430
During spring break,

258
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:09,940
want to go somewhere, just the two of us?

259
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:12,570
Yeah.

260
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,220
Sure.

261
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,240
Where should we go?

262
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:18,590
Hmm...

263
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:20,380
I'm not sure.

264
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,040
But,

265
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,550
somewhere a little far.

266
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:26,430
Sounds nice.

267
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,300
We could take a train or something.

268
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:33,500
Just looking at the scenery would be fun.

269
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,800
That's true.

270
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,940
Oh, but...

271
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:42,410
once we get our licenses,

272
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:44,220
it'd be fun to drive somewhere.

273
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,230
Like a road trip?

274
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,840
Yeah.

275
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,190
We could go to the beach

276
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:52,620
or the mountains.

277
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,140
We could go to so many places.

278
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,560
During spring break,

279
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:03,220
I want to see you

280
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:04,930
as much as possible.

281
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,520
Yeah.

282
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,380
Okay.

283
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:11,970
I want to see you, too.

284
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:15,910
Okay, then.

285
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,710
I'll make a list of places I want to go.

286
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:29,530
Watarai.

287
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,020
Yeah?

288
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,830
Should we... go out?

289
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,140
Huh?

290
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,180
What did you...

291
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,270
just say?

292
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,490
I want you to go out with me.

293
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,150
In other words...

294
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,920
I want you to be my boyfriend.

295
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,540
Watarai?

296
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:22,370
It's nothing.

297
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,470
I just feel so pathetic.

298
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:27,930
Huh?

299
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,120
Because...

300
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:34,970
I was supposed to be the one to say that.

301
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:38,570
What are you talking about?

302
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,320
Let me be the cool one for a change.

303
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:48,470
But...

304
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,320
you're already cool.

305
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:55,290
Because...

306
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,210
confessing takes so much courage,

307
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:01,060
yet you always manage to put your feelings into words

308
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,810
and tell me everything.

309
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,750
I think...

310
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,280
that's really amazing.

311
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,760
You are too.

312
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,820
Oh.

313
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,130
So,

314
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,360
uh...

315
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,500
Are you really

316
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:26,690
sure you want me?

317
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,250
Yeah.

318
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:33,150
I want you.

319
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:34,570
It has to be you.

320
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,500
I like you so much.

321
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:52,150
I'll be in your care from now on.

322
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,450
As your boyfriend.

323
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,520
Oh, boyfriend...

324
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:04,380
Ah, wait...

325
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,120
I'll... I'll be in your care too.

326
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:08,680
Why are you getting shy?

327
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,820
I am not!

328
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:12,470
So cute.

329
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,080
Look at me.

330
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:17,940
Well then,

331
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:19,590
shall we go?

332
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:21,780
Yeah.

333
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:37,680
- Come on, let's go.
- Okay.

334
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:52,080
(Class 2-5, Thank You!)

335
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:58,040
In the grand scheme of life,

336
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:01,410
high school

337
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:04,040
is just a small part of it.

338
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:08,620
But,

339
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:13,090
meeting new friends

340
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:15,710
and falling in love...

341
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,250
Oh, you're finally here!

342
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,660
What took you so long?

343
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:23,160
Weren't we all supposed to go get
conveyor belt sushi?

344
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,340
Oh, sorry, sorry.

345
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,250
I can't believe this.

346
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,480
Hm?

347
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,550
Right now,

348
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,650
I think I'm getting a little carried away with happiness.

349
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,370
Me too.

350
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:45,150
Hey, have those two
forgotten about us?

351
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,190
Totally.

352
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:47,890
They're always like this.

353
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,190
Hey!

354
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:50,430
You two over there.

355
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:51,780
You're obviously getting carried away.

356
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:52,860
Oh, sorry, sorry.

357
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:55,090
I really only had eyes for Watarai just now.

358
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:56,390
Huh?

359
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:57,770
Hey, you too?

360
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,040
You two are so lovey-dovey.

361
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:00,150
Let's go.

362
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,040
Let's go.

363
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,500
Sharing a laugh with everyone...

364
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:34,360
those days we spent together...

365
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:38,980
I'm sure,

366
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:40,990
that in the future,

367
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,410
no matter how old we get,

368
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,760
these memories will last a lifetime

369
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:49,280
and stay in our hearts forever.
