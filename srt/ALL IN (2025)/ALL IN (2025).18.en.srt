1
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:55,920
I'm here. Let him go.

2
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:02,600
Dad.

3
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,920
I'll take him out right now.

4
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,590
No rush.

5
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:08,920
We need to confirm if he's the Golden Finger.

6
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:10,280
Why are you—

7
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,200
I heard, Boss Mu Kun,

8
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:14,400
the person you're meeting later is the Golden Finger.

9
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:16,680
Why not introduce me?

10
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,150
Sorry to make Miss Sun laugh.

11
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,120
Actually, this person—

12
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,480
I'm not sure if he's the Golden Finger either.

13
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,040
Then I'll stay and help you check.

14
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,760
So that later,

15
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,510
you don't end up with a fake Golden Finger

16
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:34,200
and ruin your plans.

17
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:43,950
Over here.

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,950
It's dangerous here. You should go.

19
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,200
Young Master Mo Panbi.

20
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,400
I—I...

21
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:09,030
I'm really not working for Miss Sun.

22
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,960
You're not with Sun Yiqian?

23
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,800
Then why are you helping her

24
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,750
to seduce that worker's girlfriend?

25
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,000
This is all a misunderstanding!

26
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,360
I'm just doing business.

27
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,080
It's inevitable to get some attention from the Sun family.

28
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,840
Just returning a favor.

29
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,280
Yes, a favor.

30
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,630
You need favors, you know.

31
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:37,800
You know,

32
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,470
at such a critical moment,

33
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,590
learning to pick a side

34
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,750
is very important.

35
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:45,960
Pick... pick a side.

36
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,590
Since you refuse to say anything,

37
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,190
there's no point in keeping you around.

38
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,430
Don't.

39
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,080
I... I...

40
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm valuable.

41
00:02:59,470 --> 00:02:59,840
I have...

42
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,710
I'm valuable.

43
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:01,680
Young Master Mo.

44
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:02,800
I'm valuable.

45
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,000
I...

46
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,400
I just heard about it.

47
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,360
Sun Yiqian found someone named Mu Kun.

48
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,310
She wants to invite him out of retirement.

49
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,400
She found Mu Kun.

50
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:17,960
Mu Kun.

51
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,240
Come, come, come.

52
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:23,190
Come.

53
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,030
I'm giving you a chance to show your loyalty.

54
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,470
Take my men with you.

55
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,030
No matter what method you use,

56
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,080
stop Sun Yiqian for me.

57
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:46,520
Go now.

58
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,280
I told Jin Jin to make the call.

59
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,590
To get you here.

60
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,870
I just wanted to confirm something.

61
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,910
Are you really Golden Finger or not?

62
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,480
There's actually a misunderstanding here.

63
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,600
I can't explain it clearly right now.

64
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,800
If I say I'm not Golden Finger,

65
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,120
would you believe me?

66
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,510
I heard Golden Finger

67
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,070
inherited the God of Gambling's secret technique, Ghost Hand.

68
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,600
A cheating technique.

69
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,270
No one else can ever spot it.

70
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,160
Deal me four aces.

71
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:08,800
I can't do it.

72
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,270
So it's another impostor.

73
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,390
Boss Mu Kun,

74
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,390
let's get rid of him quickly.

75
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,870
Don't let him delay our important business.

76
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,680
Do you think pretending not to know how to cut cards

77
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,950
means I can't see through you?

78
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,040
Do you think Hao Jinjin

79
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,560
isn't in my hands?

80
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,750
Let me go!

81
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:34,680
Jinjin!

82
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,480
Lucky Brother!

83
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,000
No!

84
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,070
I'm Golden Finger.

85
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,920
Let Jinjin go right now.

86
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:50,360
I'll give you one last chance.

87
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,070
Cut out four Aces.

88
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,000
Prove you're Golden Finger.

89
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,270
If I cut out four Aces,

90
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,040
you must let Jinjin go immediately.

91
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,600
Please cut the cards.

92
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,190
Watch closely.

93
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,070
A female gambler's life

94
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,390
doesn't interest me.

95
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,040
What interests me is

96
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,000
you, Golden Finger.

97
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,360
I didn't expect this.

98
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,950
For a female gambler,

99
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:49,270
you actually revealed your identity.

100
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,630
Is it worth it?

101
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:53,920
Is it worth it?

102
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:05,950
Let Jin Jin go right now.

103
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,390
Or I'll kill your boss.

104
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,120
Get up.

105
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,190
Get up.

106
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,430
Don't do anything crazy.

107
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,190
I'm Sun Yiqian, the eldest daughter of the Sun family.

108
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,270
What are you all standing around for?

109
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,430
Hurry up and call the Sun family to save me.

110
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,160
Or I'll make sure you all die with me.

111
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,120
Back off.

112
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,510
Or I'll kill her right now.

113
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,510
Back off.

114
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Stop pretending.

115
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,310
Stop pretending.

116
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,720
Everyone in Laiwan knows you two are married.

117
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:49,950
I just didn't expect

118
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:53,000
that you really are the "golden finger."

119
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,510
Someone, tie him up!

120
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,000
Don't come any closer.

121
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,040
I have a bomb.

122
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,680
That bomb of yours doesn't look real.

123
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,750
If you don't believe me,

124
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:07,800
then let's take a gamble.

125
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,120
Let Jin Jin go right now.

126
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,720
Or I'll pull the pin.

127
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:17,750
Kid, you—

128
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,510
Calm down, calm down.

129
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:29,270
Let her go.

130
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,870
Good luck, brother.

131
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,630
They set me up to make me owe gambling debts.

132
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,080
They forced me to call you.

133
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,080
I really didn't know it would turn out like this.

134
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,000
You go first.

135
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,270
We'll talk about it later if anything comes up.

136
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:45,840
Don't worry about me.

137
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,870
If you stay here, you'll just hold me back.

138
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:48,510
Go, quickly!

139
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,390
Go!

140
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,000
Don't move.

141
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,120
You—

142
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:33,390
Good luck.

143
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,440
Why are you here alone?

144
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,440
Where's Jinjin?

145
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:39,910
I told her to run back first.

146
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm here to cover you.

147
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,150
Are your bodyguards nearby?

148
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,270
It's complicated.

149
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,550
I've already changed to a new group.

150
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:46,910
The new ones aren't up to standard.

151
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,240
Then what good is your backup?

152
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,960
It's really dangerous right now, don't you know?

153
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:51,480
First, tell me

154
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,270
What's the grudge between you and Mu Kun?

155
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,630
Why is he trying to kill you?

156
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:55,550
I don't know either.

157
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,720
We can't worry about that now.

158
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:57,750
Let's go, quickly.

159
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:02,840
Xiaopeng Sai.

160
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,240
Now we're saved.

161
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:06,840
Come here.

162
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,270
Miss Sun.

163
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,390
Hurry, catch them!

164
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,270
Take them back to Young Master Mo Panbi.

165
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,000
It looks like they're here to catch you.

166
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,440
Then what are you waiting for? Run!

167
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,030
We're done for.

168
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,870
Sun Yiqian has people stationed here.

169
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,320
I didn't expect the Sun family to arrive so quickly.

170
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,600
We probably can't escape this time.

171
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,390
It's over.

172
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,550
Brothers, take them down!

173
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:42,510
Go!

174
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:46,480
Brothers, go!

175
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:47,150
Go!

176
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:48,510
Take him down!

177
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,840
Are you hurt?

178
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,480
That Mukun...

179
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:08,550
I think I've seen him before.

180
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,000
Mukun...

181
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,550
Didn't you say you couldn't find him before?

182
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:13,840
How could you have seen him?

183
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,670
Especially that scar on his hand.

184
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,790
I feel like I've seen it somewhere.

185
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,320
I remember now.

186
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,630
I said I would pay the money back.

187
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,480
Why are you stopping me?

188
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,440
Do you not believe I can win?

189
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,390
Is it that you don't believe I can win?

190
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,440
Wait for me here.

191
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I will definitely come back.

192
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,480
Wait for me here.

193
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,030
The night my parents were killed...

194
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:55,630
He was the robber.

195
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,030
Miss.

196
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:27,630
Miss.

197
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,790
Miss, are you alright?

198
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,200
Haoyun.

199
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:34,600
Haoyun.

200
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,320
Haoyun, wake up! Haoyun!

201
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,910
Uncle Pacha, call an ambulance!

202
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,360
Call an ambulance!

203
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:42,870
Hurry!

204
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:43,600
Haoyun, yes.

205
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:44,720
Haoyun.

206
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,440
Haoyun.

207
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:50,510
It's okay.
