1
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:54,479
At best, it would just be a draw.

2
00:00:57,079 --> 00:00:57,640
Really?

3
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:19,599
How could this happen?

4
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:34,719
He actually managed to beat Nuo Yi, who's in the top three.

5
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,159
Could he really be...

6
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:39,079
You lost.

7
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,560
Hurry up and give me back my glasses.

8
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,799
Bet with me one more time.

9
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:46,599
Nuo Yi, I accept my loss.

10
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,879
You're not trying to cheat, are you?

11
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,719
Do you want it?

12
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:53,519
Come and get it.

13
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:57,560
You...

14
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:19,159
Leave this to me. You go back first.

15
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,039
About the shop on Jin Street,

16
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,439
I'll have Lawyer Jin handle it.

17
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:23,879
Thank you.

18
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,159
Nuo Yi.

19
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:35,719
Since even you lost to him,

20
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:36,960
it seems

21
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:39,840
we can't let him live any longer.

22
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,319
I won't let you touch him.

23
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,639
I'm not done playing yet.

24
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,759
Leave him to me.

25
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,319
I'll handle the charity poker tournament.

26
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,639
Alright.

27
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:07,479
Jinjin

28
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:11,039
Let me do it.

29
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:14,159
Jinjin

30
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,879
It really was my fault last night.

31
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:18,039
I did gamble at the Sun family's casino.

32
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:19,439
But I had my reasons.

33
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,919
Good Luck Brother

34
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,560
Of course you had your reasons.

35
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,159
But don't tell me.

36
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:25,360
I don't want to hear it.

37
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:26,560
Jinjin

38
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,719
Miss Sun said

39
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:29,280
she can give us a shop on Gold Street.

40
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:29,840
Enough.

41
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:31,680
Good Luck Brother

42
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:34,319
Can you stop making excuses for your gambling?

43
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:36,000
And also,

44
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,319
about the Gold Street shop,

45
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,800
Mr. Peng Sai is already helping me with it.

46
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,439
What?

47
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:44,319
You went to see Mr. Peng Sai again?

48
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,360
Mr. Peng Sai is not a good person.

49
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:47,639
Don't let him fool you.

50
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:50,199
I don't know if Mr. Peng Sai is a good person.

51
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:51,319
But I do know

52
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:53,159
you're definitely not a good person.

53
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:56,159
Sooner or later, you'll end up just like my dad.

54
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,919
Once you get involved with gambling,

55
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,680
there's no turning back.

56
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,560
Jinjin

57
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:15,000
Hello.

58
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,639
Hello.

59
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,319
I'm Lawyer Jin Dazhuang.

60
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,680
Everyone in Laiwan should know me.

61
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,800
So I won't introduce myself further.

62
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm here

63
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:26,439
on someone's behalf

64
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,920
to deliver the property deed for the Gold Street shop.

65
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:31,879
The property deed for the Gold Street shop.

66
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,800
So soon?

67
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,759
This person doesn't look like a lawyer either.

68
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,279
Could he be a fake?

69
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:47,079
No profession is more noble or lowly than another.

70
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,240
Who says lawyers can't ride bicycles?

71
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,079
This is called being low-carbon and environmentally friendly.

72
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,399
What would people of your level know?

73
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:15,519
It's really a shop on Jin Street.

74
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:29,959
What's going on? Why are you so happy?

75
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,399
President Peng Sai

76
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,240
Someone just brought over the property deed for the Jin Street shop

77
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,000
and delivered it.

78
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:37,560
Thank you, President Peng Sai.

79
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:41,439
This is nothing.

80
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,480
Who am I, after all?

81
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:44,720
An important partner of the Sun family.

82
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,680
A small shop is nothing to me.

83
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,120
What I promised you

84
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,439
I will definitely do.

85
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:53,439
I clearly earned the shop back myself.

86
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:54,720
How did it become yours?

87
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:56,480
The Jin Street shop

88
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:58,120
You earned it back?

89
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,879
Jin Jin, don't believe him.

90
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,879
He's just a liar.

91
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,839
Lucky Brother

92
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,720
is now President Peng Sai.

93
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:05,439
He helped me get the Jin Street shop.

94
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,920
You say he's a bad person,

95
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,360
then what about you secretly going gambling behind my back?

96
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:10,480
Jin Jin

97
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:11,839
A gambler!

98
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:15,000
That's really serious.

99
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,759
Don't you know Jin Jin hates gambling the most?

100
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,560
Someone like that isn't worth your effort.

101
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:20,360
Remember that.

102
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,399
Leave it to me.

103
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:23,720
Jinjin.

104
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:25,920
Gambler, do you know what to do?

105
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,720
What are you doing?

106
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,160
Don't hit him.

107
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,279
It's okay, it's okay.

108
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,920
I'm doing this for his own good.

109
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:32,639
Do you understand?

110
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,360
Gambling addiction needs to be treated.

111
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:35,839
Every time he gambles, he gets beaten.

112
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:37,360
Let's see if he dares to gamble again next time.

113
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,040
No, not like this.

114
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,120
Go take a look with Mr. Peng Sai.

115
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:40,439
See if our new shop is good.

116
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,519
Come on, be good.

117
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:42,079
I...

118
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:43,199
Let's go.

119
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:44,519
Go.

120
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:55,480
Wait until I get the evidence to Jinjin.

121
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,800
Let's see what he says.

122
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:00,079
See this?

123
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:02,839
This is your family restaurant mortgaged to me.

124
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:03,680
Exchanged for these chips.

125
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,360
After deducting your debt to me, this is what's left.

126
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:07,079
You take it for now.

127
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,879
You take it for now.

128
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:11,800
Remember this.

129
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:13,480
If you want to gamble again, come to me.

130
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,600
Given our relationship,

131
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,000
I won't make things hard for you, right?

132
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,959
I'll talk to Jinjin about it.

133
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,319
Mr. Peng Sai, let me see you out.

134
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,600
Good luck.

135
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,360
You're hurt.

136
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,759
Put some ice on it, it'll feel better.

137
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,040
Thank you.

138
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,360
Who exactly is Jinjin to you?

139
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,600
I can't believe you're willing to do so much for her.

140
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,639
Maybe our smuggling boat capsized.

141
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,199
I was unconscious on the beach at the time.

142
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,959
I had a head injury.

143
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,120
I couldn't remember anything.

144
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,319
Jinjin ignored Uncle Youqian's objections.

145
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,240
She insisted on taking me home.

146
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,319
They used the information on the boat ticket

147
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,959
to give me the name "Good Luck."

148
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:25,279
Jinjin didn't mind that I was an illegal immigrant

149
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:26,040
working odd jobs.

150
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:27,560
She took care of my food and shelter.

151
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,079
She even paid me wages.

152
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,560
This kindness

153
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:33,360
I don't even know how to repay.

154
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:38,000
Then you should marry her.

155
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,120
It's not what you think.

156
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,720
Miss Sun,

157
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:49,919
I've always wanted to apologize to you.

158
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,360
I'm sorry.

159
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:53,320
I made you angry last time.

160
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:57,200
I...

161
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:59,200
But I still really want to know

162
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:01,440
since you clearly hate gambling so much,

163
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,559
why do you insist on finding someone

164
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:04,519
to participate in the charity poker tournament for you?

165
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,080
He's so sincere.

166
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,240
If I tell him how I really feel,

167
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:11,919
maybe he'll come help me.

168
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:19,200
Only by winning this charity poker tournament

169
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:22,000
can I regain control of the Sun family's casino.

170
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,159
That way, I can cut off the family's gambling business.

171
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,639
Gamblers wager more than just money.

172
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,320
They also risk their families and their lives.

173
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:33,840
My parents too.

174
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,799
Miss, the car is here.

175
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:40,879
We can leave now.

176
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:44,960
Give me a pen.

177
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,559
Your hand.

178
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,360
This is my private number.

179
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,759
I don't care what you think.

180
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:53,200
But

181
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,879
I sincerely hope you can help me.

182
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:08,919
Miss.

183
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:13,000
Do you have a thing for that brat?

184
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,480
Uncle Pacha.

185
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,919
You know I hate gamblers the most.

186
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:18,960
I...

187
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:22,159
I'm just using him.

188
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,240
Right, right.

189
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:24,960
Our miss is so beautiful,

190
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,399
how could she possibly like him?

191
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,720
But after all these years,

192
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,039
I've never seen her care about anyone on her own.

193
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:34,720
Miss.

194
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,159
Since that kid doesn't want to help us gamble,

195
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,399
should I go look for Mu Kun again?

196
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,399
Alright.

197
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:46,639
But I do have a way to make him help me gamble.

198
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,320
But if Mu Kun is willing to come out of retirement,

199
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,720
wouldn't we have double insurance?

200
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,320
Right.

201
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,919
Alright, alright, alright.

202
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:58,200
Congratulations, congratulations!

203
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,120
Thank you, everyone.

204
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,639
Thank you all for your great support.

205
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:02,759
Congratulations, congratulations!

206
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:04,039
Congratulations, congratulations!

207
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:05,720
Wishing you a prosperous opening!

208
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:07,960
Mr. Peng Sai

209
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:10,320
Come, come, come.

210
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,360
Come, come, please, please.

211
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:14,080
Please stand here.

212
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,000
Mr. Peng Sai

213
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,200
Mr. Peng Sai

214
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,279
Dad, Mr. Peng Sai invited you here today.

215
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,360
You can stay here.

216
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,440
But after the ceremony is over,

217
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,080
you must go straight back to your restaurant.

218
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,159
Don't ever see me again.

219
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:27,559
I...

220
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,039
We're all family.

221
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:30,159
Isn't this a shame?

222
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:32,240
I won't forget what you did before.

223
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,399
You...

224
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:35,159
Jin Jin

225
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:39,120
Wait, why are you here?

226
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:39,759
Go back.

227
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:40,440
I miss Jinjin.

228
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:41,399
You can't even think about her.

229
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,759
Even thinking about her is a crime.

230
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,759
Why did he come?

231
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,039
Let me tell you,

232
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,159
today is the big day for President Peng Sai and Jinjin.

233
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,759
Don't be a third wheel here.

234
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:52,399
Don't get in the way of them getting closer.

235
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,279
Jinjin.

236
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:54,879
You need to be careful with President Peng Sai.

237
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,200
He's not a good person at all.

238
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,320
I have video evidence.

239
00:11:57,639 --> 00:11:58,600
Wait, this...

240
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:01,720
And the shops on Jin Street have nothing to do with him.

241
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,799
He's been lying to you all along.

242
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,399
You, you...

243
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,720
Watch your mouth.

244
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,120
Are you asking for trouble?

245
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:07,840
Wait a second.

246
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:10,720
This...

247
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:17,840
President Peng Sai.

248
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,799
You actually gave my dad gambling chips?

249
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,759
Weren't you always telling him to quit gambling?

250
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:25,080
Jinjin.

251
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:27,320
You don't actually believe what he said, do you?

252
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:32,720
Why is it so quiet?

253
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,200
Forget it.

254
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,399
There was never any sound to begin with.

255
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,799
But that really was me.

256
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:42,879
Jinjin.

257
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:45,200
I got those from the casino.

258
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,000
They’re chips I got back for your dad.

259
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,000
I told him to use those chips to pay off his debt.

260
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:51,080
And quit gambling.

261
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:53,000
If you don’t believe me, ask around.

262
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:56,399
Heaven and earth can attest to my honesty.

263
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:58,759
Boss Peng Sai has always been helping me quit gambling.

264
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,480
Jinjin, it’s not like that.

265
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,519
They’re lying to you.

266
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,159
You keep saying

267
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,480
that you earned this shop back.

268
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:10,120
Fine.

269
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,559
Then why don’t you tell everyone today

270
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:13,440
exactly how you earned it back?

271
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:18,480
It's Sun Yiqian.

272
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,399
I did her a favor.

273
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,960
She promised to give it to me.

274
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,159
The famous Miss Sun of Laiwan.

275
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,639
A poor guy like you did her a favor?

276
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,360
If you can't brag, don't force it.

277
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,480
I...

278
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,720
I'm actually a well-known figure in Laiwan.

279
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:40,720
Now I can even chat and laugh with the Sun family.

280
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,440
It's just returning a favor.

281
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:43,759
I've been laying the groundwork for years.

282
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,840
What makes a poor guy like you qualified?

283
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,039
You're not joking with me, are you?

284
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,559
Joking?

285
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,399
How about you prove it?

286
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:53,279
You helped Jinjin get this shop?

287
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,240
I don't have time to waste words with you.

288
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,600
I invested and acquired this shop.

289
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,320
The owners are Jinjin and me.

290
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,600
If you want to stay,

291
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:05,080
show some respect.

292
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,840
Say something nice.

293
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,080
Or you can kneel and bow to me.

294
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:09,960
As for me,

295
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:11,720
I might consider letting you stay.

296
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:12,759
You're talking nonsense.

297
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,440
You're not even the boss.

298
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:15,840
So arrogant.

299
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:16,919
Take him down.

300
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:20,559
No, don't hit him!

301
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:23,679
Don't hit him, just ignore him.

302
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:26,559
Let him go!

303
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,759
Let him go!

304
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:30,759
Bow to Mr. Peng Sai.

305
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:31,639
Bow.

306
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:33,919
Hurry up and bow.

307
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,279
Bow to Mr. Peng Sai.

308
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:54,799
It's fine.

309
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:55,919
Don't get physical.

310
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,759
Miss Sun.

311
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,840
Why is Miss Sun here?

312
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,200
She must have known

313
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:01,159
that my shop is opening today.

314
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,600
She came especially to congratulate me.

315
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,320
Miss Sun,

316
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:05,360
your visit today

317
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,399
truly brings honor to my humble shop.

318
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:10,600
Miss Sun,

319
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,720
it's enough that you came.

320
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:12,720
You even brought so many gifts.

321
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,120
I really feel embarrassed, you know?

322
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,200
Who are you?

323
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:17,759
Me?

324
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,080
I'm Xiao Peng Sai.

325
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:19,720
Move aside.

326
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:20,799
Uh...

327
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:23,480
I came here today

328
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,080
to give him a gift.
