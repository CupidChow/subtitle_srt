1
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,710
You guys leave first.

2
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,880
Leave this to me.

3
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:05,120
Young Master Mo Panbi said to clean things up thoroughly.

4
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:06,590
We should stay and help you.

5
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:07,710
No need.

6
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,200
Alright then.

7
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:14,510
We'll leave this to you.

8
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:30,950
Close your eyes and play dead.

9
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:32,760
I'll help you put on an act.

10
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:37,310
Why did you betray me?

11
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,230
I never betrayed you.

12
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:40,760
I am a member of the Mo family.

13
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,150
Then why haven't you acted all this time?

14
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,310
If you want to live, don't ask anything.

15
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,000
I've already arranged a boat.

16
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,510
You have to leave Laiwan tonight.

17
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,400
I...

18
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,000
Get up.

19
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:02,920
Hurry.

20
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,310
Quickly.

21
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,520
They've escaped! Send backup now!

22
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:35,840
Miss.

23
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,030
You can't beat Mo Panbi.

24
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,240
He has power in both the underworld and the authorities.

25
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,470
My business is none of your concern.

26
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,030
Even Mu Kun has sided with Mo Panbi now.

27
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,870
Tomorrow's charity poker tournament.

28
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,000
You can't win against him.

29
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,120
Since you're working for him,

30
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,080
then stop the car and let me go on my own.

31
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:58,800
Stop the car.

32
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:06,590
Uncle Pacha.

33
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:15,750
Uncle Pacha.

34
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,400
You've been shot.

35
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:29,280
Be careful.

36
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,310
Uncle Pacha.

37
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:43,910
Don't...

38
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,910
Qianqian.

39
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,710
Don't talk, listen to me.

40
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,710
I don't have much time left.

41
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:59,400
Ever since I came to the Sun family,

42
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,520
I thought I had become numb.

43
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,910
But I didn't expect

44
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,840
that seeing you grow up healthy

45
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,160
would make me see you as my own daughter.

46
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,870
Even though I've been lying to you all along,

47
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,480
there are many things

48
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,510
I've never told Mo Panbi.

49
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,360
Qianqian,

50
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,800
take my share certificate

51
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:53,920
and leave Laiwan immediately.

52
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,240
Live a good life.

53
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,310
Mo Panbi won't be able to find you.

54
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,750
Please stop talking, Uncle Pacha.

55
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,360
Let's go to the hospital, okay?

56
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,750
No.

57
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,510
Leave Laiwan right away.

58
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,480
Don't worry about me.

59
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:12,750
No.

60
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:15,390
No, let's go to the hospital, okay?

61
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,720
I don't want to.

62
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,560
I don't want you to die.

63
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,390
Miss,

64
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:24,000
please listen one last time

65
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,120
to Uncle Pacha's words.

66
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,430
I don't want to.

67
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:35,600
Uncle Pacha!

68
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,480
Uncle Pacha!

69
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,270
Uncle Pacha!

70
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,040
Uncle Pacha!

71
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,600
Uncle Pacha!

72
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,600
You traitors,

73
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,510
none of you will die a good death!

74
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,390
I'm sorry, Miss.

75
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,040
Young Master Mo Panbi offered too much.

76
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,190
Are you okay?

77
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,800
How did you know I'd be here?

78
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,390
I just happened to be passing by.

79
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:30,430
Passing by the cemetery?

80
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,480
Alright, don't get hung up on the details.

81
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,680
I'm here to take you away.

82
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,390
Tomorrow night's poker tournament—

83
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,720
Don't even think about joining.

84
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,830
Mu Kun has already sided with Mo Panbi.

85
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:40,270
You can't win.

86
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:41,240
I know.

87
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,270
If both of them are there,

88
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,630
then I have even more reason to go.

89
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:52,870
Dad.

90
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,430
Golden Finger's hotel is under protection.

91
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,120
My men and I can't make a move.

92
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,310
It's fine.

93
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,950
No one can beat me.

94
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,360
Anyone who can beat me—

95
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,270
won't live.

96
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,160
The fireworks have arrived.

97
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,480
Have the guys bring them in early.

98
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:15,560
Okay.

99
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,480
I'm here to compete.

100
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,360
Please show your proof of equity.

101
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,560
The chips for this tournament

102
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,560
are exchanged according to your share percentage.

103
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,720
You hold thirty-five percent of the shares.

104
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,310
Your wins or losses in the tournament

105
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:45,600
won't affect your actual shareholding.

106
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,510
How did Sun Yiqian's shares end up with him?

107
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:51,950
Don't worry, Young Master Mo.

108
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,720
Later, the two of us will go against him.

109
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:56,950
The advantage is ours.

110
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,040
These are your chips.

111
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,480
Someone will bring them to you shortly.

112
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:05,600
Thank you.

113
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,510
You're welcome.

114
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,480
I want to ask you something.

115
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:14,480
What method did you use back then

116
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,120
to deal with my master?

117
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,430
Don't worry.

118
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,560
You'll find out soon.

119
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:28,680
Why are you here?

120
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,390
How do you have so many chips exchanged from shares?

121
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,870
Didn't you ask Lawyer Jin

122
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,480
to transfer assets for risk avoidance?

123
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:38,910
You didn't specify where to transfer them.

124
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,630
They could only be transferred to my name.

125
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:41,870
I'm just holding them temporarily.

126
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,720
You Haoyun.

127
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:45,510
You're so despicable.

128
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,030
You tricked me into thinking there was a problem with my shares.

129
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,510
Then you bribed Lawyer Jin

130
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,200
to transfer the shares to your name.

131
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,670
I'll definitely settle this score with you later.

132
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,670
Looks like Old K was right before.

133
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,510
The two of them might really have a conflict.

134
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,510
My Qianqian,

135
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,960
you don't have any shares left.

136
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,150
Are you here just to watch?

137
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:16,750
Who says I don't?

138
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,150
These are the shares Uncle Pacha left me before he died.

139
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,320
Those few chips in your hand

140
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,910
might not even be enough for one round.

141
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,510
Thank you.

142
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,000
You shouldn't have come.

143
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:48,910
What's wrong?

144
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:51,670
Do you have another plan?

145
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:52,910
No.

146
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,360
It's just that at the gambling table,

147
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,390
It would only be a burden.

148
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,150
They'll definitely tamper with the surveillance.

149
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,670
If they see your cards,

150
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,120
it'll be even easier for them to figure out mine.

151
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,790
I suggest you don't make things more complicated later.

152
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:10,390
Just keep folding and you'll be fine.

153
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,080
This casino has jammers.

154
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,790
Cards with chips

155
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:29,840
won't work here.

156
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,270
But don't worry.

157
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,670
I've already bribed the dealer on site.

158
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,720
After every round,

159
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,440
he'll switch to a new deck.

160
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:38,390
This way,

161
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,720
you can cheat without any worries.

162
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:43,750
Mr. Mo,

163
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,750
let me show you something.

164
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,150
What is this?

165
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,960
It's a tool we just developed.

166
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,030
With this,

167
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:55,320
you can be a gambling master too.

168
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,630
Welcome, honored guests.

169
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,790
to the event hosted by the Sun Group.

170
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,550
the Charity Poker Tournament.

171
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:39,030
There are four contestants participating tonight.

172
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,200
They are Sun Yiqian from Sun Group,

173
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:43,670
Mo Panbi,

174
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,720
the king of gambling, Mu Kun,

175
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:50,080
and tonight's most mysterious figure,

176
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,320
the God of Gambling's apprentice, Golden Finger.

177
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:57,480
Tonight's chips

178
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,630
will be converted to cash at ten times their value

179
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,360
for charity donations.

180
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,240
As for the competition itself,

181
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,390
it will be a poker game everyone is familiar with,

182
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,510
Show Hand.

183
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,480
Whoever still has chips at the end

184
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:13,200
will be tonight's final winner.
