1
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,479
Hurry up and go!

2
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:55,439
Screw you!

3
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,680
You had this thing all along?

4
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:09,200
Why didn't you take it out earlier?

5
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:14,079
Because I like seeing men fight for me.

6
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:15,879
Hey, beautiful.

7
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,959
This has nothing to do with you.

8
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,040
As long as you hand him over,

9
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,200
I'll let you go.

10
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,200
No way.

11
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:24,920
He's my man.

12
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:27,359
I'm definitely getting involved today.

13
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:33,799
You nasty woman!

14
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,480
You're in trouble now.

15
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,120
My boss Xin Li will be here any minute.

16
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,840
You're all dead.

17
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:42,359
My boss used to be in the armed forces.

18
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,519
He's got dozens of lives on his hands.

19
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:46,239
And dozens of guns at his disposal.

20
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:47,879
If you put down your gun now,

21
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:49,359
and beg for mercy on your knees,

22
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,319
I might spare your life.

23
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:56,480
Boss!

24
00:01:58,239 --> 00:01:58,959
It's them!

25
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,719
Not only did they borrow money and not pay it back,

26
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,159
they even beat up our guys.

27
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,159
That woman has a gun.

28
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:04,879
Be careful.

29
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:27,800
She has nothing to do with this.

30
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,400
Bro, my boss is over here.

31
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,000
Sorry.

32
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,199
Boss, I...

33
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:41,560
Sister Nuoyi

34
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,599
This...

35
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:49,039
You are...

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,680
Sister Nuoyi.

37
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,560
I used to drive for President Naiwen.

38
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,800
Do you remember?

39
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:58,360
I think I remember.

40
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,479
My father did have a driver named Xin Li.

41
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:03,840
Big brother.

42
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:05,159
This...

43
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,159
You blind fool!

44
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:08,719
Big brother!

45
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,240
You actually tried to collect a debt from Sister Nuoyi?

46
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:13,039
Are you tired of living?

47
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:15,000
I'll put a hole in your head.

48
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:15,680
Don't!

49
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:18,960
Sister Nuoyi!

50
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:20,159
I really was blind.

51
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:20,879
I...

52
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,560
No...

53
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,879
Please be magnanimous and forgive my mistake.

54
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,639
Just treat it like a fart and let it go.

55
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,120
Big brother, big brother!

56
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:31,080
I'm begging you.

57
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:33,120
I really didn't know you were with Sister Nuoyi.

58
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:34,680
I-I'm not with her.

59
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,759
I really didn't know Sister Nuoyi was with you.

60
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:37,960
She—she's not with me either.

61
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,759
Stop pulling my pants, they're about to fall off!

62
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,120
Alright, alright.

63
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,560
Stop pulling, stop pulling.

64
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,680
You don't have to pay back your gambling debt.

65
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,719
Just take it as a little brother's respect for his big brother.

66
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:50,560
His matter is settled.

67
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:53,039
But you all beat him up today.

68
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,039
Shouldn't you...

69
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,400
I won't force you.

70
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,080
You tell me, what should be done?

71
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,000
Come on, hurry, hurry!

72
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,520
Faster!

73
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:17,959
Big brother.

74
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:19,639
Big brother, no, no, no.

75
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,839
No need, no need, please take it.

76
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It's just a small token, really, you don't have to.

77
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,399
If you ever need my help in the future,

78
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:24,759
just let me know. I don't want this money.

79
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:25,560
Big brother.

80
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:27,920
That's enough.

81
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,879
Alright, get lost.

82
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,839
Aren't you leaving yet?

83
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:35,560
Okay.

84
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:37,839
Get out of here.

85
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,000
Sorry, Sister Nuoyi.

86
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,680
My glasses are broken.

87
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:57,680
I really owe you tonight.

88
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:58,759
Thank you.

89
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,079
Thank you, thank you.

90
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,519
Did I say you could leave?

91
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,600
You, you...

92
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:14,800
What do you want?

93
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,920
I just saved your life.

94
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:21,560
Aren't you going to thank me?

95
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,959
Thank... thank you?

96
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:36,800
What are you thinking?

97
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,040
I want to make another bet with you.

98
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,079
Anything is fine.

99
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:41,560
If you win, you can leave.

100
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,279
Anything else is fine.

101
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:44,360
But I really can't gamble.

102
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,399
I promised Jinjin.

103
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,720
I would never gamble again.

104
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,199
Jinjin.

105
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,360
No matter what,

106
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:00,439
thank you for helping me out tonight.

107
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:02,879
I'll find a way to deal with the gambling debt.

108
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,720
Please don't come looking for me again.

109
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:06,439
Thank you.

110
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,079
This man is really interesting.

111
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:26,920
Jinjin

112
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,480
Jinjin

113
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,160
Why is no one here?

114
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:09,040
Jinjin

115
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:14,399
Jinjin

116
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,399
No

117
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,800
Aren't you Sun Yiqian's fiancé?

118
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:29,399
Why are you living in a place like this?

119
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,920
You followed me?

120
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:33,000
What exactly do you want?

121
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,000
You—

122
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:36,920
Good luck

123
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,279
I grew up in a casino

124
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,480
I started playing dice when I was three

125
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,160
By eight, I was playing Pai Gow with gamblers

126
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,680
By sixteen

127
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:47,439
No one could beat me at the gambling table

128
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,920
But you were the first

129
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:51,600
And in front of so many people, too

130
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,319
So I have to win it back

131
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:55,720
I really can't do this

132
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:57,839
I just want to live an ordinary life with Jinjin

133
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,639
I don't want to deal with your underworld

134
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,920
Then what's your relationship with Sun Yiqian?

135
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,399
I—

136
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,560
I got it.

137
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:14,800
You look like an innocent puppy on the outside,

138
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,759
but you’re actually quite the player behind the scenes.

139
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:18,600
Tell me,

140
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,959
besides those two,

141
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,199
how many other girlfriends do you have?

142
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:22,720
Sister Nuoyi,

143
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,040
please, I’m begging you.

144
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:24,839
Let me off this time.

145
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,639
I shouldn’t have beaten you back then.

146
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,240
What do you mean?

147
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:29,720
Are you saying

148
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:31,199
you can win against me whenever you want,

149
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,519
or lose whenever you want, is that it?

150
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,600
That’s not what I meant.

151
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,919
Let me tell you,

152
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:37,639
whether you want to or not, you have to gamble today.

153
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,080
I can’t gamble.

154
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,519
You can’t, huh?

155
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:42,840
Then I’ll make sure your Jinjin misunderstands you.

156
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,840
Let’s see if you can still refuse.

157
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:51,000
What are you doing now?

158
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:53,320
I’m going to sleep here tonight.

159
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,480
Just ignore me.

160
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,360
You can’t stay here.

161
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,080
If Jinjin comes back and sees you sleeping here,

162
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,159
she’ll get the wrong idea.

163
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,600
She’ll kick me out.

164
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:04,879
Sorry about that.

165
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,519
What are you doing now?

166
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:13,399
Didn’t you say you’re afraid Jinjin will find out?

167
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,879
Then let’s hide under your blanket.

168
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:18,639
No way.

169
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,320
You act like it's a hardship to sleep with me.

170
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,840
Do you know

171
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:31,159
that in all of Laiwan, not a single normal man

172
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,480
can resist me?

173
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:33,679
Now that I'm making the first move,

174
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,200
you're actually turning me down?

175
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:37,440
I just don't understand

176
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:39,840
why you insist on betting against me.

177
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,159
Then do you know

178
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:43,639
that in Laiwan, I rely on two things to stand my ground?

179
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,000
One is my gambling skills,

180
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:46,120
the other is my looks.

181
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,000
And I absolutely won't allow

182
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:50,039
anyone to reject both at the same time.

183
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,200
Oh no.

184
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,279
Jinjin is coming back.

185
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:56,399
Sis, just take it as if I've agreed to your request.

186
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:58,480
Please, just hide for now.

187
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,080
Agree to be my man.

188
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:04,519
What are you thinking?

189
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,360
