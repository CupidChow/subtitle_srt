1
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,359
Jinjin, you're back.

2
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,679
Why don't you lock the door to your restaurant?

3
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:01,920
No, that's not it.

4
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:04,239
Why are you here so late at night?

5
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:09,799
Now the whole Laiwan knows

6
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:11,719
that you're the future son-in-law of the Sun family.

7
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,680
We're just putting on an act.

8
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,879
Of course, we have to do the whole thing.

9
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,519
Otherwise, Mo Panbi will stick to me like glue

10
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,280
and keep pestering me.

11
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,000
So?

12
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:24,439
So you have to pretend to be my husband

13
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,519
and move in with me.

14
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:26,400
That's impossible.

15
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,959
I absolutely won't leave here.

16
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:30,519
Fine.

17
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,000
Then help me join the poker tournament.

18
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:34,840
I won't choose either of those.

19
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:42,840
You won't choose either?

20
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:44,200
That's fine too.

21
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,920
Then I'll leave some evidence here

22
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,799
so your Jinjin thinks you have another woman.

23
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,200
Wait, why are you all like this?

24
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:06,400
You all...

25
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:07,760
No, no, no.

26
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:08,759
You can't stay here.

27
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:12,439
Fine.

28
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,840
If you won't choose either option,

29
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:16,520
then I'll go back

30
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,599
and take back the ownership of this restaurant.

31
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,240
How can you do this?

32
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,960
Didn't you promise me yourself

33
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,960
that you'd give me the restaurant?

34
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,000
How can you go back on your word?

35
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:26,120
So what if I go back on my word?

36
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:27,560
Didn't you say

37
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:29,439
you don't like things won by gambling?

38
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,240
You...

39
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:32,599
If there's nothing else, I'll go now.

40
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:36,759
Okay.

41
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:38,719
I promise you.

42
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,280
Promise me what?

43
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,319
Promise to help me gamble.

44
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,599
What are you thinking?

45
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,879
Of course, to pretend to be a couple with you.

46
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,960
Don't bring up gambling again.

47
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,439
I definitely won't touch it.

48
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,360
Fine then.

49
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,599
Not gambling? Didn't you just promise to gamble with me?

50
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,280
Nuoyi.

51
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:02,680
Aren't I just dealing with her?

52
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:04,560
Who are you dealing with?

53
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:06,759
Enough.

54
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:08,759
What do you want from me?

55
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:10,840
Good luck.

56
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,639
You're quite the ladies' man.

57
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,319
In the middle of the night,

58
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:16,639
there are still people eager to date you.

59
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,759
Aren't you afraid you'll wear yourself out?

60
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,759
Good luck, I'm just saying,

61
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,960
Miss Sun is a wealthy heiress,

62
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,719
and she's shamelessly insisting on marrying you.

63
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:27,000
But you only have Jinjin in your heart.

64
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,879
Where does that leave Miss Sun's dignity?

65
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:30,400
But you clearly know

66
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,280
you're not the one she truly loves.

67
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:33,199
Yet in the middle of the night,

68
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,639
you still come running to someone else's house.

69
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,280
You—

70
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:36,520
Aren't you ashamed?

71
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:37,759
Who says I'm the one chasing?

72
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,080
Say that again.

73
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,560
If you want me to, I'll say it again.

74
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,400
You're the one chasing.

75
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:44,879
That's enough.

76
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,439
You two, stop arguing here.

77
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:50,360
If Jinjin comes back and sees you here,

78
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,800
how am I supposed to explain?

79
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:52,479
Shut up.

80
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,159
Say it.

81
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:58,000
Are you lying to her or to me?

82
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,520
Of course I'm lying to you.

83
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:00,840
She already said she doesn't gamble anymore.

84
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,280
How dare you lie to me!

85
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,319
I'm not lying to you.

86
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:05,919
Then you are lying to me.

87
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,719
I'm not lying to you either.

88
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:08,479
Are you messing with us?

89
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:09,520
Are you betting with me

90
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:10,960
or pretending to be a couple with her?

91
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,599
How about we talk somewhere else?

92
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:14,439
No.

93
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,120
You have to give us an explanation today.

94
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,560
Otherwise, we won't leave.

95
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,920
How are you two suddenly so in sync?

96
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:26,959
Don't interrupt.

97
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:28,160
Hurry up and talk.

98
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,279
Lucky Brother, are you there?

99
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:33,680
It's over, it's over.

100
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,680
This time Jinjin really came back.

101
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:37,319
How about you two hide in the bathroom first?

102
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:37,879
I'm not going in.

103
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,600
Me neither.

104
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,759
Alright, alright, I promise you.

105
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:43,319
Then make it clear first.

106
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,439
What are you promising?

107
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:45,680
Promise to be a couple with you.

108
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:46,600
Promise to bet with you.

109
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:47,360
Okay.

110
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,279
That doesn't seem right.

111
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,079
Okay, no more backing out.

112
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,439
Alright, alright, alright.

113
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,079
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

114
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,519
Lucky Guy

115
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm going to the bathroom first, Jinjin.

116
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:08,560
Then hurry up, I need to go too.

117
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,480
I've got diarrhea.

118
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,199
It'll probably smell pretty bad when I'm done.

119
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:17,839
Don't make a sound.

120
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,839
No rush, I'll wait for you.

121
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:32,639
What do you mean by that?

122
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:35,040
Nothing.

123
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:37,639
Unlike some people who will do anything to achieve their goals,

124
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,079
and use any means necessary. That's just pointless.

125
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:41,959
Don't say "some people."

126
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:43,240
Just say it's me.

127
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,519
Lucky Guy is right there.

128
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:46,240
Ask him if he has it.

129
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,079
No, no.

130
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:49,959
Ladies, please stop talking.

131
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,720
When it comes to using any means necessary,

132
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,560
no one beats you, Sun Yiqian.

133
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,120
You—

134
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:57,319
Please, I'm begging you both to stop talking.

135
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,160
Lucky Brother

136
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:08,959
I...

137
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:10,879
I...

138
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,040
Lucky Brother

139
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:16,040
What's wrong?

140
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:18,319
Actually, there's something

141
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,279
I want to make clear to you, Lucky Brother.

142
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:21,959
Lately, have you

143
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,399
still been in contact with Miss Sun?

144
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,759
No, absolutely not.

145
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,759
Actually, what I want to say is

146
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,199
Miss Sun is a good person.

147
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,639
If she ever gets a chance to find you,

148
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,160
you must seize it.

149
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,920
Yes, yes, yes.

150
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:43,360
Miss Sun is really nice.

151
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,399
But her family is involved in gambling.

152
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,199
I still need to keep my distance.

153
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,519
But think about it,

154
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:53,120
Miss Sun just says a word,

155
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:56,199
and the restaurant we could never earn even by working ourselves to death

156
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,000
she just gave it to us.

157
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,000
And behind the restaurant,

158
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,639
she gave us such a nice place to live.

159
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:05,240
Someone of her social status

160
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:08,360
is someone we could hardly ever meet.

161
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:10,519
So,

162
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,480
you should really seize this opportunity.

163
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:14,360
Gambling is not good.

164
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,399
But I believe you have self-control.

165
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,240
You won't end up like my dad.

166
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:26,079
I understand, Jinjin.

167
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,639
Actually, I don't want to gamble.

168
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:30,360
I have my own reasons for that.

169
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:35,240
I'll support whatever decision you make, Lucky Brother.

170
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:38,759
As long as it leads to a better future.

171
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,120
Lucky Brother,

172
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,519
you'll always stay by my side and help me,

173
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:45,959
right?

174
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,160
You're all I have now, Lucky Brother.

175
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:55,279
Only you, Lucky Brother.

176
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,399
You two, stop talking.

177
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,720
What was that sound?

178
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:01,079
I'm fine.

179
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,199
Can I ask you a question, Lucky Brother?

180
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,040
What do you think of me?

181
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,240
You're great.

182
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,759
What's great about me?

183
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,920
You're hardworking, diligent, and really cute.

184
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,680
Am I good-looking?

185
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:31,560
Yes, you are.

186
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:35,240
Then...

187
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:37,960
How do I compare to Miss Sun?

188
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:44,000
I know Miss Sun comes from a good family and she's beautiful.

189
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:48,480
Do you still think I'm good-looking?

190
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,480
Of course.

191
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:54,200
Why did you shout so loudly?

192
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,759
I was afraid you wouldn't believe me.

193
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,480
Among all the girls you've met,

194
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:04,000
where do I rank?

195
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,200
The...

196
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,039
First.

197
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:19,000
Then I'm second or third, huh?

198
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,200
That's not what I meant.

199
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,120
Is that so?

200
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,840
Stop fighting, stop fighting.

201
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:27,799
Stop fighting.

202
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,240
What was that sound?

203
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,279
There was no sound.

204
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:34,960
Is there someone else inside?

205
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,039
No, there isn't.

206
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,960
Why did you lock the door, Lucky Bro?

207
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:45,320
The lock seems to be broken.

208
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,759
I can't open it at all.

209
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,600
Then, just wait there.

210
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:49,879
I'll go find the key to get you out.

211
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,799
What should I do? What should I do?

212
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,639
Jinjin is coming in soon.

213
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,759
Hurry and find a place to hide.

214
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,080
Quickly!

215
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:01,679
Jinjin is coming in.

216
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,840
Please, you guys, hide!

217
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,000
It's so small here, how can we hide?

218
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,279
Lucky Bro, I'm coming in!
