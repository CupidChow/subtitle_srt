1
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,719
So it's Sister Nuoyi.

2
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,719
What brings you here today?

3
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:15,000
To play at my little casino.

4
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,359
I'm not here for you.

5
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:27,439
I'm here for him.

6
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,640
Sister Nuoyi.

7
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,280
How about this?

8
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:46,280
This truckload of cash

9
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:48,599
is a gift from our casino to you.

10
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:52,040
Why don't we leave it at that for today?

11
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,519
I heard Miss Sun's fiancé

12
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:01,680
is the God of Gambling's disciple.

13
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:03,760
I'm here to challenge him.

14
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,080
How about this:

15
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,240
Let's have a gamble.

16
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:15,599
If I win,

17
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,240
I'll trouble Miss Sun

18
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,840
to transfer this casino to Mo Panbi's name.

19
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,719
If you happen to win,

20
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,039
I can give you a casino too.

21
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:29,759
Or is there something else you want?

22
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,639
Let me thank my Sister Nuoyi first.

23
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,240
But Sister Nuoyi,

24
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:44,840
compared to a casino,

25
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,240
I'd rather you help my fiancée

26
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,439
expose this fraud who claims to be the God of Gambling's disciple.

27
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,240
If you're not really the God of Gambling's disciple,

28
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,879
then you're deceiving my fiancée.

29
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,400
I'll have to rip your tongue out.

30
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:13,199
Wait, why am I being dragged into this again?

31
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,759
Don't go.

32
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:18,960
Mo Panbi.

33
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,439
Who is your fiancée?

34
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,759
Aren't you just trying to

35
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:23,319
get our Sun family's casino?

36
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,400
Fine.

37
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,840
Let's have a bet today.

38
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:30,280
But if you lose this time,

39
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,479
from now on,

40
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,719
don't ever bring up that so-called engagement again.

41
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:37,599
Hurry, go, I—

42
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,439
What are you doing?

43
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:46,479
If you help me win today,

44
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:48,599
I'll agree to any condition you want.

45
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:49,840
I told you,

46
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,120
I'm fine with running errands or odd jobs,

47
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,879
but I won't gamble.

48
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:56,479
If you help me win today,

49
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,159
I'll give you the entire Golden Street.

50
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,599
I really can't.

51
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:03,680
Good luck.

52
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,199
I've heard

53
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,000
that your Hao Jinjin hates gambling the most.

54
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,520
You probably don't want her to know

55
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:15,039
that you're at the casino today, right?

56
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:17,040
Look,

57
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,079
Mo Panbi's people

58
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,800
will definitely send out all the photos tonight.

59
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:21,680
They'll spread them everywhere.

60
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,199
Tomorrow, all of Laiwan will know you were at the casino.

61
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:29,160
Including Hao Jinjin.

62
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,959
Miss Sun,

63
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,360
you're setting a trap for me.

64
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:38,000
What those reporters will write

65
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,399
is out of my control.

66
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,040
But,

67
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,560
if you help me win this round,

68
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,439
I can make all the reporters keep quiet.

69
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,639
Dad

70
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:11,519
There are still survivors from the previous cruise ship explosion.

71
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,879
Didn't they say everything had been taken care of?

72
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,040
This wasn't supposed to happen.

73
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,000
But a few bodies were eaten by fish in the sea.

74
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,160
It's normal that they couldn't be found.

75
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,879
I didn't expect this.

76
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:35,319
I didn't expect it.

77
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,920
No matter what method you use,

78
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:43,399
this person

79
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,600
cannot be allowed to live in Laiwan.

80
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:48,399
Yes.

81
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:06,199
Get up.

82
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,319
Sign this.

83
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:13,319
Then you can leave.

84
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:14,959
Okay.

85
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:24,000
This...

86
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,639
This is an agreement to sell my organs!

87
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,759
Since you refuse to sign,

88
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,240
Guards!

89
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:36,319
Take him back to the death cell.

90
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:38,560
I'll sign!

91
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,399
I'll sign, I'll go!

92
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,360
I'll sign!

93
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,680
I'll sign!

94
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,600
Go ahead, what do you want to play?

95
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,120
You just won so much money with the dice.

96
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:57,560
Let's play dice, then.

97
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:00,360
Are you looking down on me?

98
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,439
Alright.

99
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,240
Then let's play dice, highest number wins.

100
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:06,800
Miss.

101
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:08,680
It won't be easy for us to win this time.

102
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,839
You just returned to Laiwan.

103
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,399
If we lose the casino,

104
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,920
it'll be hard to explain to the board.

105
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,720
What do you mean?

106
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:19,839
Nuo Yi is all about skill.

107
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:22,480
I'm afraid things don't look good this time.

108
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,199
He's the one I chose.

109
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,839
Win or lose, I'll accept it.

110
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,519
We'll figure something out later.

111
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:33,839
Yes.

112
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:57,079
Turns out it's six sixes.

113
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,399
Your turn.

114
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,800
Reveal it, go ahead.

115
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:45,559
He really pulled it off.

116
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,559
Yes.

117
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:53,639
What a pity, Sister Nuo Yi.

118
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:55,879
Sister Nuo Yi didn't get to keep winning this round.

119
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,120
Uncle Pacha, prepare the car.

120
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,480
Take Sister Nuo Yi back.

121
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:00,360
Yes.

122
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:01,759
Wait.

123
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:04,120
What is it?

124
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:07,080
Sister Nuo Yi, are you going back on your word?

125
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,120
Qian Qian, don't be hasty.

126
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:14,240
I remember Sister Nuo Yi just said

127
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:15,840
the loser leaves.

128
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,039
But Sister Nuo Yi didn't lose.

129
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:20,320
So no one is leaving.

130
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:23,159
Good luck.

131
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,759
I haven't lost yet.

132
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:26,600
Some people already want to send me away.

133
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:29,039
You just got lucky earlier.

134
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,360
When we played for the highest, you rolled six sixes.

135
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,039
How about we play for the lowest this round?

136
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:40,240
Is Nuo Yi going to use the "Dragon Spits Pearl" move?

137
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:43,639
"Dragon Spits Pearl" is Nuo Yi's signature skill.

138
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,200
Hardly anyone in Laiwan can do it.

139
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:49,120
Looks like Lucky is going to lose.

140
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,480
What is "Dragon Spits Pearl"?

141
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:55,879
"Dragon Spits Pearl" uses centrifugal force

142
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:58,960
to stack all the dice in a straight line.

143
00:09:59,440 --> 00:09:59,960
This...

144
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,759
That doesn't sound too hard.

145
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:04,399
Stacking them in a line isn't hard.

146
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:05,840
The hard part is

147
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,360
the second die from the top.

148
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:11,399
The second die must show one dot.

149
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,039
Because only the pit for one dot

150
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,480
can support the top die to hang in the air.

151
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,440
So that none of its faces are facing up.

152
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:22,200
Which means it shows no number.

153
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,039
No number.

154
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:25,919
Right.

155
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,720
That's why Nuo Yi

156
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,080
chose to play for the lowest.

157
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,879
Because no matter how lucky you are,

158
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,159
it's impossible to get no number.

159
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,519
It's over.

160
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,000
Please.

161
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,840
Why aren't you rolling?

162
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,600
Are you afraid you can't do it?

163
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:00,960
Let me go.

164
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,039
Let Lucky go.

165
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,879
Jin Jin, why are you here?

166
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,440
They didn't do anything to you, did they?

167
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:17,879
I'm fine.

168
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,480
I'll be able to go back soon.

169
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:30,360
You are

170
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:32,440
gambling.

171
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:34,759
Jinjin, let me explain.

172
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,159
I...

173
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:35,799
I was so foolish.

174
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:39,559
I even asked you to persuade my dad not to gamble.

175
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,480
Jinjin.

176
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:41,679
But you’re gambling too.

177
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,320
Please, let me explain.

178
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:48,559
Give me back my glasses.

179
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,120
You want your glasses?

180
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,279
Finish this round with me.

181
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,120
You’re forcing me.

182
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,399
That’s better. Good.

183
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:41,759
You lost.

184
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,120
How is that possible?

185
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,279
Even with good luck, you still rolled "Dragon Spitting Pearl."

186
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,960
Not only is the top die still spinning,

187
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,360
but all the ones below have one facing up.

188
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,399
