1
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:07,870
Jinjin

2
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:16,200
Where are they?

3
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,840
The woman threw up all over the man and ran off.

4
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:20,590
The man didn't tip me and ran off too.

5
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:35,510
Sorry.

6
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:37,350
I-I feel really sick.

7
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,070
Um, well, President Peng Sai...

8
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:40,790
I have something to do at home, so I'll leave first.

9
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:42,840
Jinjin

10
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,840
Now you can relax, right?

11
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,560
Hao Jinjin has already gone home.

12
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,150
Where are you going?

13
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,790
I'm going back.

14
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,680
You just owed me a favor.

15
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:08,710
And now you want to run away?

16
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,190
Miss Sun

17
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,750
I've told you many times.

18
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,430
I won't agree to join your charity event.

19
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,310
I know.

20
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,680
But you can't just leave like this.

21
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:18,590
Then what do you want?

22
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,590
At least have a drink with me.

23
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,870
Leave two bottles of wine, then disappear.

24
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:27,870
Alright, alright, alright.

25
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:28,710
I'll disappear right away.

26
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,000
You've been following me all day.

27
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,840
What exactly do you want?

28
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,190
This is for you.

29
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,240
This is for you.

30
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,310
When I went to look for you last night,

31
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,710
I saw that your glasses were broken.

32
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,280
I was going to give this to you this morning.

33
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,360
But you ran off.

34
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,710
Don't use these glasses anymore.

35
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,520
Contact lenses should be more convenient.

36
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:21,000
You can keep your thanks to yourself.

37
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:22,590
Hurry up and take it.

38
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,030
Thank you.

39
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,560
Last time you said

40
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,750
you wanted to take back the family casino's management rights

41
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,000
and then cut it off.

42
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,190
Why is that?

43
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,310
Because of gambling,

44
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,520
I lost my family.

45
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,590
I want another one.

46
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:50,710
You want to buy another one?

47
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:53,710
Okay.

48
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,190
Dad, you're the best.

49
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,470
Are you happy?

50
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:57,800
Stop!

51
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,030
Stop!

52
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,080
What are you doing?

53
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:00,910
Take out the money.

54
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:02,680
Okay.

55
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,960
Here, it's all yours.

56
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,470
Please don't hurt my family.

57
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,470
I'm borrowing money, not stealing it.

58
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,960
I'm going to the casino right now.

59
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:10,960
If I win money,

60
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,280
I'll pay you back with interest.

61
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,680
It's okay, it's okay.

62
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,750
Take off the necklace.

63
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:19,480
Take off the necklace.

64
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,430
Hurry, okay.

65
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,190
It's all yours.

66
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,160
Hurry up.

67
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:23,950
It hurts.

68
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,190
Please don't hurt my daughter.

69
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:42,800
Fill it up.

70
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:49,600
Why does this wine look familiar?

71
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,480
What did you say?

72
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:01,240
This is the wine that Peng Sai drugged.

73
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,190
The wine you just drank was drugged.

74
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,120
Drugged?

75
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,000
It's not poison, is it?

76
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:11,830
Hurry, spit it out!

77
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,870
I can't spit it out.

78
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,950
Stick your finger down your throat, down your throat!

79
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,480
I can't do it.

80
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,720
Let me do it.

81
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,920
Let go, let go, let go!

82
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,830
Even sticking a finger down your throat doesn't work.

83
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:38,950
Then what do you suggest?

84
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:40,800
Got it!

85
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,510
Harder!

86
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:48,800
If I use this much force,

87
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,040
can you handle it?

88
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:52,360
Don't stop!

89
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,950
Okay, here I go!

90
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,000
Shameless couple!

91
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:58,600
Keep going.

92
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,920
Where's my bag?

93
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,070
Jerk!

94
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,270
What are you doing?

95
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,190
I'm about to throw up.

96
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,720
I should be asking what you two are doing.

97
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:33,360
I'm using the Heimlich maneuver to help her vomit.

98
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:34,270
You...

99
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,510
Do you think I'm stupid?

100
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:40,390
The Heimlich maneuver?

101
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,600
That's for clearing blocked airways.

102
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,240
What are you doing?

103
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,560
Let go of me!

104
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,870
If she doesn't throw up now, it'll be too late!

105
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,720
If you touch her again,

106
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,950
I'll break your hand, believe it or not.

107
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:52,070
Why is it suddenly so hot?

108
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,270
It's so hot. I want to take off my clothes.

109
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:00,950
Miss Sun, you can't do that.

110
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:01,600
You can't.

111
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,510
No, no, no.

112
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,190
I want to take off my clothes.

113
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,160
No.

114
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:09,830
What are you doing?

115
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,560
I want a kiss.

116
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,070
Hold her back, quickly!

117
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,070
I'll tie her up.

118
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:16,830
Hurry up, I want a hug.

119
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,240
I can't hold her much longer.

120
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:28,720
I'm so tired.

121
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,390
Why is it that every time I run into you,

122
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,680
nothing good ever happens?

123
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,800
What's wrong with her? Is she poisoned?

124
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,560
She drank something that was drugged.

125
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:40,720
Alcohol.

126
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,070
Now we're in trouble.

127
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,160
It's so hot...

128
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,430
Don't touch me.

129
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:53,000
I want...

130
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
No, no, no.

131
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,160
Move away a bit.

132
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,480
I really can't.

133
00:07:58,630 --> 00:07:59,870
Don't take off my clothes—hug me.

134
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:00,870
Stay away from me.

135
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,000
I want a hug.

136
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,390
Don't come over here.

137
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,870
Don't come over—hurry up!

138
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,000
Lucky brother.

139
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,070
Jinjin.

140
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,750
Alright, alright.

141
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,390
I'm so stupid.

142
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,510
I actually thought

143
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,040
you only had one woman outside.

144
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,720
Jinjin, you came at the right time.

145
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,390
I really need you right now.

146
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:30,750
Isn't having two enough for you?

147
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,840
Jinjin, don't go.

148
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,270
I really need you.

149
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,030
Jerk!

150
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:57,960
Little troublemaker.

151
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,440
I told you to introduce investors to Hao Jinjin,

152
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,600
to introduce investors.

153
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,960
Not to use these dirty tricks.

154
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,360
Miss Sun,

155
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:10,270
I think you might be misunderstanding.

156
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,630
You know what kind of person I am.

157
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:13,750
How could I possibly do something like

158
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,000
putting drugs in someone's drink?

159
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,480
Right?

160
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,000
I'll drink as punishment.

161
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,840
President Peng Sai

162
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,550
Don't say I didn't warn you.

163
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,480
Among these three glasses of wine,

164
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,390
only one hasn't been drugged.

165
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,080
If you're unlucky,

166
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:37,480
See?

167
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,080
Only it can give you the antidote.

168
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:51,910
I...

169
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,390
I'm not...

170
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,150
Have you seen this woman?

171
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,080
If you do see her,

172
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,030
be sure to tell us.

173
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,270
I...

174
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:31,870
Let's go.

175
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,030
It should be him.
