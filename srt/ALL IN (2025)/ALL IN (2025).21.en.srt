1
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:53,920
Let me introduce myself.

2
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,560
I am Golden Finger.

3
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,430
Golden Finger?

4
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,350
And I'm the Buddha's relic, then.

5
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:05,040
Do you even consider the occasion before bragging?

6
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,680
You guys are really something.

7
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,590
You invite me over,

8
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,640
then tell me to leave.

9
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:13,230
Who would invite you here anyway?

10
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,350
And look,

11
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:16,400
Miss Sun isn't here today.

12
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,680
No one's here to clean up your mess.

13
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:19,950
If you can't show an invitation,

14
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,640
then get lost.

15
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,640
Golden Finger's invitation?

16
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,040
How could you have that?

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,790
Could he really be Golden Finger?

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,510
Impossible.

19
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:36,350
That invitation of his must be fake.

20
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:38,680
Someone like him, just a low-level worker,

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
it's normal for him to do shady things like this.

22
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,760
But what is his real goal?

23
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,680
Be careful, he might ruin things between you and Jin Jin.

24
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,480
I'll scare him to death.

25
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:00,230
It has to be authentic French cognac.

26
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,230
Isn't that...

27
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,150
The Seine?

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,590
The Seine.

29
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:05,710
I've even been there.

30
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,630
Isn't that the Sun family's son-in-law?

31
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:12,750
Yeah.

32
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,030
Just to marry in,

33
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,430
he goes around lying that he's Golden Finger.

34
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,630
So shameless.

35
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:21,120
Isn't he afraid of being exposed and humiliated here?

36
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,240
When we get there, I'll cover everything.

37
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,000
Don't touch it.

38
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,190
This is a gift I prepared for Golden Finger.

39
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,630
If you break it, how will you pay for it?

40
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,680
I'll pay with my life.

41
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:36,430
Yes.

42
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:37,840
How is it?

43
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,360
Not bad, right?

44
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,520
The price is just a number.

45
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,080
Name your price, I can afford it.

46
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,630
I'm telling you,

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,120
don't stoop to that bumpkin's level.

48
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,710
These gifts,

49
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:53,520
I bet he's never seen anything like them in his life.

50
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,470
Of course.

51
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:55,430
That's true.

52
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:56,800
Everyone here tonight

53
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,000
is a wealthy person worth over a hundred million.

54
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:00,800
If you ask me,

55
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,590
you'd better stick to being a waiter.

56
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:03,710
Otherwise,

57
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,400
I'll break your legs.

58
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,120
Where are you going?

59
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,520
Hurry up and take him away.

60
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,080
Otherwise, it's too embarrassing.

61
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:14,910
Why bother with him?

62
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,400
Doesn't he like to show off?

63
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,560
Let's see how he gets himself killed today.

64
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,120
True.

65
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:27,080
Assets over a hundred million,

66
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:29,310
still doesn't mean much here.

67
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,430
I...

68
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:31,910
You bumpkin!

69
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,470
Do you believe I can keep you from leaving this place?

70
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,310
Did I say I was leaving?

71
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,310
Fine, fine.

72
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,520
I'll call someone right now.

73
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,240
I'll beat you until you beg for forgiveness.

74
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,750
Big words.

75
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,280
I'd like to see who dares.

76
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,800
Sister Nuoyi.

77
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,800
I think the one who should be kneeling and begging for mercy is you.

78
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:54,680
Nuoyi.

79
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:55,430
Sister Nuoyi.

80
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,120
Even if he's with Nuoyi,

81
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,960
he can't treat us so rudely.

82
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:02,710
After all, in Laiwan,

83
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,630
we have status and position too.

84
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,030
Exactly.

85
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,310
Even if we don't break his legs,

86
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,680
making him bow and apologize

87
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,800
isn't too much to ask, right?

88
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,870
Of course you can.

89
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,600
If you don't want to do any business in Laiwan

90
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,360
from now on,

91
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,160
go ahead and try.

92
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,950
How come there's another woman protecting him now?

93
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,630
That lousy worker sure is lucky.

94
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,630
I...

95
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:31,750
I'll take my leave.

96
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:33,720
Goodbye. Let's go, let's go.

97
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,360
They're gone.

98
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,680
This must be

99
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,680
the famous Miss Nuoyi.

100
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,870
I'll remember your kindness today.

101
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,870
Haoyun, where have you been these past few days?

102
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,240
Our family's casino was blown up.

103
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,270
Even my father...

104
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,630
Uncle Naiwen has passed away.

105
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,560
Yes.

106
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,430
Miss Nuoyi.

107
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,000
My condolences.

108
00:04:59,310 --> 00:04:59,920
Haoyun.

109
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,310
What's wrong with you?

110
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,040
I heard Miss Nuo Yi is known for being passionate and outgoing.

111
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,160
We've only just met, not even for a minute.

112
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,800
Our relationship isn't that close, is it?

113
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,310
Good luck.

114
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,070
Are you pretending to have amnesia with me?

115
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,920
I don't know what Miss Nuo Yi is talking about.

116
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,430
I was indeed injured a few days ago.

117
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,870
If we had any connection before,

118
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,240
let's catch up after I'm done with my work.

119
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:29,680
Good luck.

120
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,240
Mu Kun.

121
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:43,920
Good luck.

122
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,000
Why are you acting like a different person?

123
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:48,920
Stop.

124
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,390
Where are you going?

125
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,560
This stage is reserved for Golden Finger.

126
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,510
Don't cause trouble here.

127
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,270
Hurry up and leave.

128
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,600
I'm talking to you.

129
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,390
Tonight is very important to me.

130
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,070
I don't have time to argue with you here.

131
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,430
Go cool off somewhere else.

132
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,000
Fine.

133
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:10,510
Have today's organizer come see me.

134
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,270
Worker.

135
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,750
Am I being too nice to you?

136
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:18,560
Young Master Mo Panbi.

137
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,600
He even forged Golden Finger's invitation.

138
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,480
You need to teach him a lesson.

139
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,270
Take him out.

140
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,070
Brother Good Luck.

141
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,510
Hurry and apologize to them.

142
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,160
Miss Hao.

143
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,390
Please remember this.

144
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,480
First,

145
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,190
My name is not Good Luck.

146
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,000
My name is You Haoyun.

147
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,120
Second,

148
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,800
I'm not a waiter.

149
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,040
I'm the apprentice of the God of Gambling.

150
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,510
I don't care if you're called Good Luck or Haoyun.

151
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,560
Someone, come here!

152
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:45,950
Come over here.

153
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,000
Come.

154
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:52,600
Nuo Yi

155
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,600
Your father is already dead.

156
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,720
And you still have time to meddle in this?

157
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,070
It's true my father passed away.

158
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,870
But the Naiwen family hasn't fallen yet.

159
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:03,720
I want to see who dares to make a move today.

160
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,160
Let's see if you can protect him today.

161
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,560
Break his arms and legs.

162
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,430
Throw him out.

163
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,310
Go get him!

164
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,270
Wait!

165
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,270
This is

166
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,630
a legal document that has already been signed.

167
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,600
It can prove

168
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:47,870
that You Haoyun is the God of Gambling's apprentice, Golden Finger.

169
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,240
After this legal document was signed,

170
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:53,480
he inherited all of the God of Gambling's assets.

171
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:08,870
My name is You Haoyun.

172
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,800
Also known as Golden Finger.

173
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,430
The God of Gambling's apprentice.

174
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,120
I officially announce

175
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:15,750
I'm back.

176
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,240
Okay.

177
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:27,920
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

178
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,070
Take a look, take a look.

179
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,430
What a talented young man.

180
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,720
He looks extraordinary at first glance.

181
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:32,750
He's not an ordinary person.

182
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:35,080
Earlier, we failed to recognize your worth.

183
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,030
We didn't know you were the Golden Finger.

184
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,670
All these gifts are prepared for you.

185
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:41,390
You can spend them however you like.

186
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,870
Yes, yes, yes.

187
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:46,270
I don't want any of these things.

188
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,000
Not these.

189
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,360
We've prepared other things for you as well.

190
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,360
Yes, yes, yes.

191
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:53,600
I want you all to disappear.

192
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,870
Then we'll leave.

193
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,600
We're leaving.

194
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,360
See you.

195
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,550
Goodbye, we're leaving, we're leaving.

196
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,120
Goodbye, we're leaving now, see you.

197
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,030
Goodbye.

198
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,200
We're leaving, leaving, leaving.

199
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,790
This is the cash you asked me to prepare.

200
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,150
I owe you all for saving my life.

201
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,630
You made me do odd jobs, run errands, and take the blame before.

202
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:24,510
I even had to clean up after you, a hopeless gambler.

203
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,670
None of that matters.

204
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,390
But you keep looking down on me again and again.

205
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,120
No, we don't.

206
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,600
You don't believe in my abilities.

207
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,670
Now the money is right here.

208
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:39,840
Do you want it or not?

209
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:43,360
We want it.

210
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,550
Is it really okay to just take it like this?

211
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,000
From today on,

212
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,720
my daughter Hao Jinjin

213
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,120
will be the woman of Golden Finger You Haoyun.

214
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,030
Dad.

215
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,550
Peng Sai, get lost.

216
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,000
Don't be a toad trying to eat swan meat.

217
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:05,960
Brother Haoyun,

218
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,720
for anything I didn't do well before,

219
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,240
please forgive me.

220
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:11,270
Exactly.

221
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:14,600
Who acts like this?

222
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,440
So shameless.

223
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,550
He's not fit to be a father.

224
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,390
That's right.

225
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,000
He only cares about money.

226
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,030
Yeah, who does that?

227
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,960
Money, money.

228
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,360
Money, money!

229
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,670
Hao Youqian, get up.

230
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,320
Aren't you ashamed acting like this?

231
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,750
Leave me alone.

232
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,790
Golden Finger, my brother.

233
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:51,790
It's a misunderstanding.

234
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,000
A misunderstanding.

235
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,910
Actually, I've always treated Jinjin

236
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,270
like my own little sister.

237
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,200
I was blind, I admit.

238
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,600
Please, be the bigger person and forgive me.

239
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,840
Wouldn't you agree?

240
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,870
Who says we're brothers?

241
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,630
I can let this go.

242
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,630
Fiancée or little sister, whatever.

243
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:15,910
I want you to take Hao Jinjin's whole family and get out of Laiwan.

244
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,630
Otherwise, you know what will happen.

245
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,030
Understood, understood.

246
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:24,000
Good luck, brother. You're so righteous.

247
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,720
I'll take them away tomorrow.

248
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,550
I—I'll leave today.

249
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:29,720
I'm leaving.

250
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,320
Go, it's all mine now!

251
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:33,320
I've struck it rich!

252
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,750
This time, I came back

253
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,670
for one reason only.

254
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,320
Let me make this clear.

255
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,120
My master, the God of Gambling,

256
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,240
never lost to anyone.

257
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,390
It was Mu Kun who slandered him

258
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,120
and killed my master.

259
00:11:58,790 --> 00:11:59,630
So,

260
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,270
at the Sun Group's

261
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,670
charity poker tournament,

262
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,080
I will defeat Mu Kun

263
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,390
and clear my master's name.

264
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,840
He really is a cheat.

265
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,480
This is bad.

266
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,150
But I noticed he seems to have lost his memory.

267
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,000
Look.

268
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,670
Nuo Yi, Jin Jin.

269
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:29,600
He doesn't recognize them at all.

270
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,790
Is that possible?

271
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,960
He doesn't remember Sun Yiqian either.

272
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,870
I don't care who he remembers now.

273
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Or who he doesn't remember.

274
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,790
I just want to ask him right now.

275
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,480
What gives him the right at our Sun Group's

276
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,840
charity poker tournament to challenge Mu Kun?

277
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,840
Does he even have that qualification?

278
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:48,440
To participate in our company's tournament,

279
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,270
you must own

280
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:52,030
at least one percent of our company's shares.

281
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,240
But right now, Sun Yiqian

282
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,150
hasn't transferred any shares at all.

283
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:58,670
What's going on?

284
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:00,960
Young Master Mo,

285
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,600
someone outside says they want to see you.

286
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,550
No, no, I won't see anyone.

287
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,870
He says he can help you deal with the cheat.

288
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:10,910
Who is it?

289
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,000
Young Master Mo, it's him.

290
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,750
Last time, he ruined our plans.
