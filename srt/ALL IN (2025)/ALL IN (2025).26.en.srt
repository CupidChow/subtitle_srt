1
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,400
What was that sound?

2
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,280
A bomb.

3
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,070
The bomb was fake.

4
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,000
The bomb was real.

5
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:34,040
It was just switched.

6
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,040
Who switched it?

7
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:39,480
How was it switched?

8
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,510
Xiazhi.

9
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,400
Thank you.

10
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,310
Come.

11
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,150
I wasn't poisoned tonight.

12
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,950
She was the one who coordinated it.

13
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,200
Why didn't you say so earlier?

14
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,080
You scared me to death.

15
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,680
Why did you help us?

16
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,360
Mu Kun killed my husband.

17
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,360
Actually, You Haoyun's master

18
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,520
didn't lose to Mu Kun.

19
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,120
You don't admit it?

20
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,710
It was Mu Kun who cheated and refused to admit defeat.

21
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,630
He killed the God of Gambling.

22
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:27,240
What do you want me to admit?

23
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,910
You promised me.

24
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,080
If you lost, you'd leave Laiwan.

25
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,800
The boat is mine, and the people are mine.

26
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,150
Where do you want me to go?

27
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,000
Gambling is about luck, not cheating.

28
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,360
What do you want?

29
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:43,310
Speak.

30
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,400
I'll destroy you.

31
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,840
He even blew up my husband's boat with a bomb.

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,360
Now my wish has been fulfilled.

33
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,630
I can finally go home in peace.

34
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,360
Xiazhi.

35
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:25,470
I'll bring Lele to visit you in the future.

36
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:33,590
Goodbye.

37
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,870
Thank you for tonight.

38
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,590
You helped me win this bet.

39
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,400
I just wanted to avenge my master.

40
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,560
Actually, it didn't matter who won tonight.

41
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,240
I didn't care either way.

42
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:05,800
Where are you going?

43
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,680
I don't know.

44
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,430
I'll just go wherever I end up.

45
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,080
I want to show the world

46
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,510
my master's most advanced gambling skills.

47
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,430
So everyone can become a gambling master.

48
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,190
What? You...

49
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,190
The highest level of gambling skill is, of course,

50
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,680
winning by not gambling at all.

51
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,750
He just left like that.

52
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,390
Let him go.

53
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:49,480
I liked the old, naive Lucky.

54
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,040
Not the slick-haired Golden Finger.

55
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:56,920
Nuoyi.

56
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,720
Today, as the head of the Sun Group,

57
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,560
I officially announce to the public

58
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,430
that to better adapt to society's development,

59
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,360
our Sun Group has decided

60
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:27,600
that from this moment on,

61
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:30,270
we will close all casinos and related businesses.

62
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,070
Let go of me.

63
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,240
Young Master Mo! Young Master Mo! Young Master Mo!

64
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,800
Young Master Mo, you illegally transferred assets.

65
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,870
Is this true?

66
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:45,600
Is this true?

67
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,480
Please explain, Young Master Mo.

68
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,750
Please answer, Young Master Mo.

69
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,040
Young Master Mo, please say something, Young Master Mo.

70
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,190
Please explain to us, Young Master Mo.

71
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,240
Young Master Mo! Young Master Mo!

72
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,360
Explain to us, Young Master Mo.

73
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,000
Please answer, Young Master Mo.

74
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:54,630
No.

75
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,390
Young Master Mo.

76
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,310
Young Master Mo.

77
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,270
Did you illegally transfer assets?

78
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:57,870
Young Master Mo.

79
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,750
Young Master Mo.

80
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,160
Stop filming.

81
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,750
Young Master Mo, please explain to us.

82
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:19,830
Auntie.

83
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,720
Excuse me, where is the previous owner of this shop?

84
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,000
How would I know?

85
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,870
What bad luck.

86
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,600
The previous owners were all gamblers.

87
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,750
After racking up gambling debts,

88
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,040
they disappeared.

89
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,160
The debt collectors came here and splashed paint.

90
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:22,750
Dad

91
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,270
Dad, I'll go get your medicine.

92
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,390
Dad, wait here.

93
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,270
These are all my things.

94
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,390
Put it down.

95
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:52,190
Dad

96
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,630
I originally planned to give you money

97
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,040
so you could stay away from trouble.

98
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,870
I didn't expect it would end up hurting you.

99
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,190
Jinjin

100
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,390
Since you hate gambling

101
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,270
why are you still willing to indulge in it?

102
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:36,550
Or is it that what you hate isn't gambling

103
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:38,720
but losing?

104
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,630
You Haoyun

105
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,360
Don't get me wrong.

106
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,910
I'm not here to ask you to stay.

107
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,390
I just remembered before

108
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,150
I forced you to sign a cooperation agreement.

109
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,120
Since you're about to leave Laiwan,

110
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,030
let's just cancel the agreement.

111
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,870
I think I forgot to bring it.

112
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,550
Wait a moment, I'll have someone fetch it.

113
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:47,440
No need to fetch it.

114
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:52,080
That agreement was never fingerprinted.

115
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,440
I tricked you into admitting it, didn't I?

116
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,390
If you really lost your memory after falling into the sea,

117
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,440
how do you remember the fingerprint wasn't done?

118
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:08,120
I knew all along you were faking your amnesia.

119
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:12,510
Otherwise,

120
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,910
how else would you have forced Hao Jinjin's family

121
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:15,960
to leave Laiwan?

122
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:18,480
Why did you ask Nuoyi to save me?

123
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:22,600
And why did you ask Xia Zhi to help set up the trap?

124
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,270
Now you only don't remember me.

125
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:28,360
Ow, ow, ow!

126
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:28,870
Qianqian!

127
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,120
Be gentle, be gentle!

128
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,240
I...

129
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:32,790
How dare you lie to me!

130
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,030
I didn't mean to deceive you.

131
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,200
If I hadn't kept some distance,

132
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,750
Mu Kun and his people would have hurt you.

133
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,510
As for what happened before, that's not my concern anymore.

134
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,150
Now the fingerprint has been added.

135
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:05,870
You can't escape now.

136
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,750
But all the Sun family's casinos have been shut down.

137
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,790
There's no point in me staying.

138
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,150
Who said you had to stay with the Sun family?

139
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,270
This time, it's a marriage contract.

140
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,120
Now we

141
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,030
are legally married.

142
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,360
Wherever you go, you have to take me with you.

143
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:36,120
Wait, no...

144
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:36,960
Hold on.

145
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:37,840
Something doesn't seem right.

146
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,550
Lawyer Jin said this isn't legally valid.
