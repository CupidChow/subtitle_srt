1
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,710
Welcome! What would you like to eat?

2
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,110
One order of fried chicken, please.

3
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:03,840
Of course.

4
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,710
Sit wherever you like.

5
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:08,790
Sir.

6
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,760
You look a bit familiar to me.

7
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:12,870
You've been here before.

8
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,430
I've been here a few times before.

9
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:16,430
This is the place.

10
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,870
Hao Youqian, what are you doing here?

11
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,840
Can I use this restaurant to pay off my gambling debt?

12
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,070
Yes.

13
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:30,200
Here.

14
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:30,950
For you.

15
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:32,920
How do you have the property deed to my restaurant?

16
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,150
Then... can I leave now?

17
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:36,950
You can.

18
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:39,680
Beat him up before letting him go.

19
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,310
No, wait.

20
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:41,950
I...

21
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:42,950
I... this...

22
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:45,150
No, don't!

23
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:46,350
I'm telling you,

24
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,430
I don't know this person.

25
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,510
Give me the property deed.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,870
Then you can leave.

27
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,350
I don't care about any of that.

28
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:56,040
All I know is he owes me two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.

29
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,070
If you don't pay up,

30
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,710
I'll take your restaurant.

31
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,680
What are you doing? Stay back!

32
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,870
Don't come any closer!

33
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,000
Don't break my stuff!

34
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:11,750
Stop!

35
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,080
I can give you some time.

36
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,960
After one day,

37
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,240
I want to see two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.

38
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,150
If I don't see it,

39
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,520
you can say goodbye to your restaurant.

40
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,590
Let me think, who are you again?

41
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,400
Xiaoya, right?

42
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,000
Alright, don't be mad.

43
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,470
I'll take you somewhere nice later.

44
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,360
You're so annoying.

45
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:15,960
I'm hanging up.

46
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,080
Sorry.

47
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,190
This place might not be able to stay open.

48
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,080
I do have an idea.

49
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,870
I don't know if you'd be willing.

50
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,590
Actually, I'm a math teacher.

51
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,680
I used to count cards at the casino.

52
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,430
I got blacklisted.

53
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:01,590
I'm banned from betting.

54
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,080
If you're willing to place bets for me,

55
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,240
if we win money,

56
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,470
we'll split it fifty-fifty.

57
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:11,520
But...

58
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,430
you're just placing bets for me.

59
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,680
If we lose, it's on me.

60
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,160
Of course.

61
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,720
If you feel uncomfortable,

62
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,120
just forget it.

63
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,190
Goodbye.

64
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:31,750
Wait.

65
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,430
I want to give it a try.

66
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,310
Try to sit at the edge if you can.

67
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,190
That way, I'll have more time to count cards.

68
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,480
Just place bets according to my instructions.

69
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:51,390
How is it?

70
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,480
Counting cards is pretty simple, right?

71
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,950
Just follow my instructions when you place your bets.

72
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:57,270
Then you can win.

73
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,630
You need to lose on purpose in the next round.

74
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:03,800
Why?

75
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,870
You can't keep winning in the same place.

76
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,830
The dealer is already watching you.

77
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,190
Okay.

78
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,270
I...

79
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,950
All of this is yours.

80
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,510
I...

81
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,270
I...

82
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,830
I just need enough to pay back the restaurant's money.

83
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:38,750
The rest is for you.

84
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,630
We agreed to split it fifty-fifty.

85
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,360
If you hadn't helped me place the bets,

86
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,430
I couldn't have won this much.

87
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,040
But...

88
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,600
It's fine.

89
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,800
I still need to go back to school to prepare my lessons.

90
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,480
If you're still interested,

91
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,360
call me to set up a time.

92
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,240
Goodbye.

93
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,310
It's a total of 250,000. Count it carefully.

94
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,000
Take it.

95
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,920
Let me say this again.

96
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,270
I don't know that Hao Youqian guy.

97
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,270
Any gambling debts he owes in the future

98
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,190
don't come to me about them.

99
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,160
Alright.

100
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,720
The money I worked hard to earn in a month

101
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,080
is less than what I make in half an hour at the gambling table.

102
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,270
Hello?

103
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,750
Sorry.

104
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,270
The school suddenly sent me out for training.

105
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:03,870
I won't be able to come during this period.

106
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,910
Let's reschedule.

107
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:06,390
Okay, it's fine.

108
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,910
Since this money didn't belong to me in the first place,

109
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,670
I'll just lose it all before I leave.

110
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,320
I won.

111
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:34,480
It's all mine.

112
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,870
Miss, I won again.

113
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:01,120
Deal.

114
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:05,360
What luck!

115
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,790
Miss, do you want to keep playing?

116
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,670
If you want to play, place your bet.

117
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,080
If you don't have enough money, we can lend you some.

118
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:19,790
I'll play.

119
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,270
Here.

120
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:25,360
Um...

121
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,630
Let me go back, please.

122
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:27,720
I still have money at my shop.

123
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,200
I'll go get the money for you.

124
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:30,200
Is that okay?

125
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:32,670
Here she comes.

126
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:33,440
It's you.

127
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,240
I... I accidentally lost too much just now.

128
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,150
Can you lend me some money?

129
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,150
Boss.

130
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:42,120
Boss.

131
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,910
Why are they calling you boss?

132
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,390
Sorry, miss.

133
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,630
Actually, I'm not a math teacher.

134
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,600
I'm just someone who runs a casino.

135
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,600
W-What do you mean?

136
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,000
You...

137
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,550
You tricked me into gambling.

138
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:12,000
Tricked?

139
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,360
Did I force you to come here today?

140
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,200
You came here on your own, didn't you?

141
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:19,440
Weren't you the one who wanted to gamble?

142
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:20,960
I really didn't expect this.

143
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,840
You're a bad person.

144
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:24,870
Give me my money back.

145
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:33,320
How am I suddenly the bad guy?

146
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,840
Everyone who gambles is a bad person.

147
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,150
Then that means you are too.

148
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,120
He is too. Everyone is.

149
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,600
Gambling stirs up people's greed.

150
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,390
That's the most primitive human nature.

151
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,150
Aren't you the same?

152
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:50,120
Don't move.

153
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,870
Actually, you don't have to pay back the money you owe my casino.

154
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,200
You just need to do me a small favor.

155
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:04,790
Call that worker named Lucky.

156
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,240
Have him come pick you up.

157
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:07,550
Then the two of you

158
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,670
can leave safely.

159
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,600
Someone's here.

160
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,200
No.

161
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,600
It's the eldest daughter of the Sun family.

162
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,600
She says she's here to discuss a partnership with you.

163
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,150
Sun Yiqian.

164
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,550
Lock her up for now.

165
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,200
Lock her up first.

166
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,320
Let's go.

167
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,600
I... I'll walk by myself.

168
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,390
Uncle Pacha, where's my bodyguard?

169
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,670
Why do you always mess up at the critical moment?

170
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,510
Have we met before?

171
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,150
Mu Kun, the king of gambling.

172
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:26,750
You’re really hard to find.

173
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:28,480
I’m Sun Yiqian.

174
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:29,910
Nice to meet you.

175
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,670
Miss Sun, nice to meet you.

176
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,270
What an unfortunate coincidence.

177
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,270
I have to meet a guest soon.

178
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:42,150
Miss Sun, please wait for a moment in the VIP room.

179
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,000
Take Miss Sun to the VIP room.

180
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,510
Let me go!

181
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,910
I’ve already called Brother Haoyun.

182
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:51,750
Go, quickly!

183
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:52,440
Let me go, please.

184
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,670
Why is she here?

185
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,960
We can’t let Golden Finger escape this time.

186
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,720
Tell the guys to get the gear ready.

187
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,240
Golden Finger.

188
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,600
Are they using Jin Jin to catch Haoyun?

189
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,000
No, I have to warn them.

190
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,000
Miss Sun.

191
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,240
The VIP room is this way.

192
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:13,550
Since Mr. Mu Kun is busy,

193
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,240
I’ll come back another day.

194
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:19,000
Alright.

195
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:21,270
Let me see you out.

196
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:25,200
I’m here. Let her go.
