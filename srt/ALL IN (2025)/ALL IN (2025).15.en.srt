1
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,560
Dead men tell no tales.

2
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:58,750
Boss,

3
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:00,430
How about

4
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,790
we talk somewhere else?

5
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,230
Why change places?

6
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,790
Isn't this place just fine?

7
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:11,000
There's a kid nearby.

8
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,840
It's even more exciting with a kid watching.

9
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,760
It's not safe here. Go, quickly!

10
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,120
Lele, hurry, go!

11
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,560
Dad, you're hurt!

12
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,560
Thank you, Lele.

13
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,150
You're hurt.

14
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:15,680
Sit down first.

15
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,310
I'll get some gauze to bandage you.

16
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,960
Go watch cartoons over there for now.

17
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,430
Why did you lie to me?

18
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,080
Who are they? Why do they want to kill you?

19
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:44,910
I didn't lie to you.

20
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,520
My name is Xia Zhi.

21
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,190
Your name is You Haoyun.

22
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,000
But I'm not your man.

23
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,400
Lele isn't my daughter either.

24
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,240
Please trust us.

25
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,630
We absolutely never meant to deceive you.

26
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,750
We just want you to help us leave Laiwan.

27
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:07,560
Because...

28
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,000
Because you're the only one we can rely on.

29
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,560
Dad, do you not want us anymore?

30
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,190
Don't worry.

31
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,590
I'll get you both out of Laiwan safely.

32
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,800
Thank you, Dad.

33
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,960
Thank you for saving us.

34
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,520
And for getting so badly hurt.

35
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:33,310
In a bit,

36
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,590
I'll help you change and take a bath.

37
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,710
You must know my real identity.

38
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,310
Right?

39
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,630
I think it's better if you don't know.

40
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,400
Hello?

41
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,280
Miss, where are you now?

42
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,520
I'm at the old street.

43
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,280
Why did you go there?

44
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,720
Why didn't you tell me?

45
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,560
I found out the address of Mu Kun that Mo Panbi got.

46
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,270
It's right here.

47
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,070
Miss, aren't you going to use your luck to join

48
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,310
the charity poker tournament?

49
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,680
Since luck can't be on our side,

50
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,270
we can only look for Mu Kun.

51
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,830
Miss, come back quickly!

52
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,240
This is too dangerous.

53
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,160
Qianqian.

54
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,630
I'm here.

55
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,680
Why are you here?

56
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,190
Because I never found Mu Kun at all.

57
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,600
I gave you a fake address on purpose.

58
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,430
I tricked you into coming.

59
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:00,920
So childish.

60
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,240
Let's go.

61
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,480
Well played, Mo Panbi.

62
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,600
You actually bribed someone close to me.

63
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,360
Since you're already here,

64
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:16,390
then sign this marriage agreement.

65
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,390
Just sign it.

66
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,000
Once you sign, I'll let you go back, okay?

67
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,240
Young Master Mo Panbi,

68
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,000
have you forgotten our previous agreement?

69
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,390
We agreed not to mention the engagement again.

70
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:28,560
Besides,

71
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,950
I already have a fiancé now.

72
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:34,390
Stop pretending.

73
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:37,750
Everyone knows that guy is already married.

74
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,360
How could he be your fiancé?

75
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,270
What if I don't sign?

76
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm being nice to you, aren't I?

77
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,680
Do you even have a choice?

78
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,510
Young Master Mo

79
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:09,750
My eyes

80
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:14,680
Sun Yiqian

81
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,510
Today, I insist on having a choice

82
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:22,750
You

83
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm going to get some cash

84
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,120
We'll need it later

85
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,560
Be careful

86
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,630
You're following me again. Good luck

87
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,560
Help me, someone's chasing me

88
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,240
Stop

89
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:55,920
Don't run

90
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,000
This way, hurry

91
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,190
What tricks are you playing?

92
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:01,600
Why are you talking nonsense?

93
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,160
Don't run

94
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:05,270
Stop

95
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,430
Don't run, over there

96
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,360
Stop

97
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,040
Hurry, stop

98
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:19,750
This way

99
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:20,750
Go

100
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,430
Look at the path you chose

101
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,270
Didn't you just choose this way too?

102
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:35,800
Run

103
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,120
You go that way, split up and chase

104
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:46,750
You two, come with me

105
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,160
Go, go, go

106
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:54,800
Follow me

107
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:02,920
Hurry, take off your clothes

108
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,240
What?

109
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,310
Are you crazy?

110
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,560
If you won't, I will

111
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,950
Where is she? Where did she go?

112
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,510
She's not here either.

113
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,680
Why does that figure look so familiar?

114
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:32,960
It's her.

115
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:34,030
Stop!

116
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:35,600
Stop!

117
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:37,870
Miss Sun.

118
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:42,480
Sir, is there something you need?

119
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,240
Sorry, we mistook you for someone else.

120
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,030
Sorry about that.

121
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,030
Miss, do you have time to have a meal together?

122
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,670
Have a meal, my foot! Let's go.

123
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,510
Keep chasing!

124
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:54,750
Sorry!

125
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:55,910
Come on, let's go, go, go.

126
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,000
Go that way. Okay, okay.

127
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:57,670
Hurry up!

128
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,360
It's safe now.

129
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,320
You can come out now.

130
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,200
I just saved you.

131
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:16,510
Why did you hit me again?

132
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:18,390
Just because you saved me doesn't mean you can look at things you shouldn't.

133
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:20,480
Watch out or I'll gouge your eyes out.

134
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,960
I had no choice just now.

135
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,270
Alright, alright, I have things to do.

136
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,240
Let's switch back first.

137
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,030
You still want to look?

138
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,440
Stop hitting me.

139
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,120
If you hit my face again, it'll swell up.

140
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,080
Then swear it.

141
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,670
If you ever

142
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:39,600
look at another woman's body again,

143
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,670
you'll gouge your own eyes out.

144
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,670
Alright, alright, I swear.

145
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,720
If I ever look at another woman's body,

146
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,080
I'll gouge my own eyes out.

147
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:49,670
That's more like it.

148
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,510
Let's go back and change clothes.

149
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,000
Wait, hold on.

150
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,240
Something doesn't seem right.

151
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,240
These are the boat tickets for this afternoon.

152
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,270
These are things to use on the boat.

153
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,320
You and Lele, hurry up and pack your things.

154
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,080
No rush.

155
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,240
There's still some time before we leave.

156
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:25,000
It's better to leave early.

157
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:29,440
Where's Lele?

158
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:34,790
Haven't you always

159
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:36,120
wanted to recover your memories?

160
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,240
I'll take you somewhere.

161
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,200
It's up there.

162
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,600
Wait a moment.

163
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:49,240
What's wrong?

164
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,270
This is for you.

165
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:54,360
What is this?

166
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:57,080
Hasn't Lele always wanted to eat this?

167
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,440
Even though I'm not Lele's father,

168
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:01,670
after spending these past few days together,

169
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,390
I've really grown fond of Lele.

170
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:12,840
What's wrong?

171
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:15,630
It's nothing.

172
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,080
Let's go.
