1
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:55,039
Don't talk, kiss me.

2
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,320
Don't be like this.

3
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:02,920
I'm just here to work.

4
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,400
Don't get so close.

5
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,439
If you take advantage of me, I'll kill you.

6
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,719
I didn't move.

7
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:09,560
You're the one moving.

8
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,519
Sun Yiqian.

9
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:14,640
Looks like you're hungry.

10
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,439
You'd even go for someone like that?

11
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:19,680
He's not just anyone.

12
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,040
He...

13
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:24,040
He's the God of Gambling's apprentice, Golden Finger.

14
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,840
When did I become

15
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,640
the God of Gambling's apprentice, Golden Finger?

16
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,719
When did the God of Gambling ever have an apprentice?

17
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,719
Sorry to disappoint you, Young Master Mo.

18
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:39,920
Uncle Pacha.

19
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,280
See the guest out.

20
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:42,799
Young Master Mo.

21
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,480
Please leave.

22
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,840
He looks like a country bumpkin to me.

23
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,760
How could he possibly be the God of Gambling's apprentice?

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,599
Our Sun family has always kept our cooperation with the God of Gambling a secret.

25
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,920
You're an outsider.

26
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:01,040
There’s a lot you don’t know.

27
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,319
Besides,

28
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:04,079
don’t you think

29
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,280
stray dogs are cute?

30
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:09,199
Let’s go.

31
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:10,400
Wait.

32
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,400
If this stray dog really is Golden Finger,

33
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,759
do you dare to make a bet with me?

34
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,159
Mo Panbi,

35
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:22,759
what makes you think you’re qualified

36
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:23,919
to gamble with the God of Gambling’s apprentice?

37
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,199
Then,

38
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,560
this stray dog isn’t a fake, is it?

39
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,599
Afraid to accept the challenge?

40
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:36,000
You keep calling him a stray dog,

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,800
aren’t you underestimating Golden Finger a bit too much?

42
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:40,319
Fine then.

43
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,479
Whoever loses later

44
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:44,120
has to bark like a dog.

45
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,080
I don’t want to get involved in your business.

46
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,199
I don’t want to gamble either.

47
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,240
Let me tell you,

48
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,360
the person ahead is a real villain.

49
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,319
If you don’t help me,

50
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,680
he’ll take over my family property

51
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,960
and force himself on me.

52
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,520
I know you're a good person.

53
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:18,360
If you just stand by and do nothing,

54
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:19,840
won't your conscience hurt?

55
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,439
It hurts, it hurts!

56
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:21,479
My conscience hurts.

57
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:22,400
It really hurts.

58
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,159
Are you two done talking?

59
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:25,879
Are we still gambling or not?

60
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,120
Texas Hold'em, Blackjack, Dice—

61
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:30,199
What are we betting on?

62
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,039
I don't know how to play any of those.

63
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:34,080
No way.

64
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:36,840
He actually doesn't know any of these?

65
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:40,680
Makes sense.

66
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,919
Look at how rustic he looks.

67
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,719
How could he possibly have a golden touch?

68
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,520
Having good luck means

69
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,159
he never loses.

70
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,599
I...

71
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,120
If it's about gambling skills,

72
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,919
that would be too unfair to Mo.

73
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:04,879
So,

74
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,400
how about drawing high or low cards?

75
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,800
I can't do it.

76
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:24,639
I...

77
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,680
Uncle Pacha told me to come here to work.

78
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,240
You just need to do it like you did on the fish raft.

79
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,079
Just draw a card.

80
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,360
Let me borrow your luck for a bit.

81
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:55,000
It's a potion.

82
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:57,600
The potion can mark the back of the cards.

83
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,680
With special glasses, Mo Panbi

84
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:01,079
can see the value of the cards.

85
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:03,839
Please.

86
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:05,680
You go first.

87
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:15,000
The third card from the left.

88
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,439
Forget it.

89
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,720
The situation is unclear.

90
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:21,000
Better listen to her.

91
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,399
Sorry about that.

92
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,360
I'm the Ace of Spades.

93
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:55,639
Young Master Mo, your luck is really good.

94
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,240
But if it's best two out of three,

95
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,439
just relying on luck won't be enough.

96
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:02,720
When did I ever say it's best two out of three?

97
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:05,360
I also never said it would be decided in one round.

98
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:11,199
Fine, whatever.

99
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,959
Let's see how you beat me.

100
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,360
But I have a condition.

101
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,600
If I win this second round,

102
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:20,759
you have to fulfill your engagement.

103
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,720
Marry me, Mo Panbi.

104
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,759
Watch how I win this round.

105
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:48,920
Ace of Spades.

106
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:00,800
Ace of Spades.

107
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:03,000
It's tied, one to one.

108
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:08,680
Could it be that Young Master Mo Panbi also has the Ace of Spades?

109
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:12,279
There's only one Ace of Spades in a deck.

110
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,360
Young Master Mo isn't a card cheat.

111
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:16,279
How could he draw the Ace of Spades every time?

112
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:19,160
Let's say you got lucky.

113
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,560
Next round.

114
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,839
Didn't expect this country bumpkin to have some skills.

115
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:32,000
Next round, I'll turn over the Ace of Spades.

116
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,120
I'll finish him off directly.

117
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,879
Next round, I want to draw first.

118
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,839
Isn't that against the rules?

119
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,720
You drew first last round.

120
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:41,879
I've already compromised with best two out of three.

121
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,079
Can't you compromise just once?

122
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:43,720
You...

123
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:44,759
Fine.

124
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:46,399
But I have a condition.

125
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,920
Next round, I'll shuffle the cards.

126
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:48,959
Shuffle the cards?

127
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,079
Shuffle however you want.

128
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:50,959
No problem.

129
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:55,480
No matter how you shuffle,

130
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,160
I can still find the Ace of Spades.

131
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,360
It's not mine.

132
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:27,000
What's wrong?

133
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:29,279
When did he

134
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:31,040
switch out the whole deck?

135
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,879
You draw a card.

136
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,399
Two of Diamonds.

137
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:57,480
So what card do you need to draw to win?

138
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:59,960
Maybe I can't lose no matter what I draw.

139
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,200
Isn't the Two of Diamonds the lowest card?

140
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:04,840
Is it?

141
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,840
I'm done playing.

142
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:09,080
Young Master Mo Panbi,

143
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,519
aren't you forgetting something?

144
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:12,759
What did I forget?

145
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:16,480
You forgot you have to bark like a dog if you lose.

146
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,960
When did I ever say I'd bark like a dog?

147
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:20,360
You're being unreasonable.

148
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,720
Take him away, take him away.

149
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,559
Don't block the way.

150
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:25,279
Take him away.

151
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,600
Sorry about that.

152
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:28,639
Our dog doesn't understand human language.

153
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,279
If you want it to move,

154
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:33,480
you'll have to speak dog language.

155
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:34,240
I...

156
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:46,279
Sit.

157
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,600
Young Master Mo Panbi's barking

158
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:58,240
is really something else.

159
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,399
Even the dog understands him.

160
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,120
Just you wait.

161
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,720
I won't let you off.

162
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,519
Miss Sun,

163
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,240
I have something to do, so I'll go first.

164
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:18,240
Don't ask me to do this kind of thing again.

165
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:26,159
Miss,

166
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,639
this person's gambling skills are unpredictable.

167
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,320
Plus, his background is unknown.

168
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,039
We can't use him.

169
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,879
Do we have any other options?

170
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,960
The charity poker tournament is next month.

171
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:41,720
We still can't find Mu Kun.

172
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:45,600
I think he can do it.

173
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:52,519
What?

174
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:54,240
He left without even taking the money.

175
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:58,240
What exactly do you want me to do?

176
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,639
Oversee our Sun family's casino.

177
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:04,840
Help me win next month's charity poker tournament.

178
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,480
No.

179
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:07,519
I can't do this job.

180
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:09,799
I've already looked into it.

181
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,039
You've had your eye on a shop on Gold Street lately.

182
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:15,919
As long as you agree to help me,

183
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,440
I can give it to you directly.

184
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:20,960
A shop on Gold Street?

185
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:23,799
By the way, Lucky Brother,

186
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,879
about what I asked you to look into before,

187
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:27,879
how's the matter with the Gold Street shop going?

188
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:33,080
Look,

189
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,840
this shop looks really nice.

190
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:40,879
But it's too expensive.

191
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:44,000
Someday, I must have

192
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,399
my own shop and life.

193
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:48,320
I have to leave Hao Youqian.

194
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,399
Before he drains me dry.

195
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,200
Leave here.

196
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:54,919
Brother Good Luck.

197
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,519
What I hate most in this life are gamblers.

198
00:11:58,519 --> 00:11:59,279
Promise me.

199
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,759
Never get involved in gambling.

200
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,519
Not even once.

201
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,759
Jinjin, don't worry.

202
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,639
I, Good Luck,

203
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:11,440
I'm here to thank you.

204
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,519
For helping us today on the fish raft.

205
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:15,720
So our Sun family has decided

206
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,759
to offer you a job.

207
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,000
Sir,

208
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:20,919
it was nothing, no need to thank me.

209
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,840
I don't need a job or anything.

210
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,519
I already have a job.

211
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,440
Don't rush to answer.

212
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:28,360
Think it over carefully.

213
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:30,039
After you've thought it through,

214
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,679
call me at the number on here.

215
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,240
I must help Jinjin live a good life.

216
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,240
A gambler shouldn't pretend to be so noble.

217
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:54,440
As long as you agree to work with me,

218
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:56,440
money and a shop space

219
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,279
are all yours.

220
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:02,600
Brother Good Luck, something's wrong!

221
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:05,480
What's wrong, Jinjin?

222
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,399
My dad, he...

223
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,120
Hurry, let's go!

224
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,120
You still come to gamble with no money?

225
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,200
Just one more bet.

226
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,159
Just one more bet.

227
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:22,240
I can definitely win it back.

228
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,360
Trust me.

229
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,559
Cut the crap.

230
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,799
Left hand or right hand?

231
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,120
You pick one.

232
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:29,919
Can I just cut my fingernail?

233
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:31,399
Are you messing with me?

234
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:34,720
Th-this...
