1
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,560
Then I have the highest hand.

2
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,880
So that means I win.

3
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:02,350
Wait.

4
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:05,400
What now?

5
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:13,200
I have a straight.

6
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,150
What?

7
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,150
A straight.

8
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,560
Actually, I didn't have a six at all.

9
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,040
I just pretended the revealed six was my hidden card.

10
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,040
I played a mind game with you.

11
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,680
If you hadn't switched cards,

12
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,870
your full house would have beaten my straight.

13
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,560
But you tried to break up my four sixes

14
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,280
and even cheated.

15
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,590
You ended up ruining yourself.

16
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,120
A diversion tactic.

17
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,870
Weren't you poisoned?

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,510
Did you switch the wine?

19
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,920
I didn't switch the wine.

20
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,430
I just changed the waiter.

21
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,030
Since you weren't poisoned,

22
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,190
why didn't you just win directly earlier?

23
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,240
If I had won directly,

24
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,800
how could I have tricked you into giving up all your shares?

25
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,400
And also,

26
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:31,590
the dirty tricks you used against my master—

27
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,430
Looks like the outcome is decided.

28
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,910
I announce

29
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:42,470
that tonight's final winner is Miss Sun Yiqian.

30
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:44,750
Not bad at all.

31
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,520
You're quite skilled.

32
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,000
Congratulations.

33
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,680
A bet is a bet.

34
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,310
With so many witnesses here today,

35
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:01,280
you can't go back on your word.

36
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,470
Sun Yiqian.

37
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,080
How much money have I made for the Sun family over the years?

38
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,280
And in the end,

39
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,120
is this really how it ends for me?

40
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,150
You—

41
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,190
Qianqian

42
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,000
Qianqian

43
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,680
Listen to me

44
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:35,000
You've always wanted to shut down the casino

45
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:36,840
But do you know

46
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,840
how many ordinary people

47
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,680
work their whole lives

48
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,080
and still can't make as much as they could win in one night at the casino

49
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:51,280
All these years, I've been working to develop the casino

50
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,030
I just want to give those poor people

51
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,590
a chance to turn their lives around

52
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,120
Am I wrong

53
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,030
You

54
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,430
But do you know

55
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,030
Out of a hundred times gambling

56
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,240
there are a hundred times of cheating

57
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,680
If you keep gambling, there's only one outcome

58
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,400
And that's losing

59
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,840
You only see that gambling gives everyone

60
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,270
the illusion of getting rich overnight

61
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,920
But you don't see what gambling does to everyone

62
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,040
and the harm it brings to every family

63
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,510
Qianqian

64
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,680
Forget it.

65
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,510
Even if you take back the Sun family,

66
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:43,480
it will just be an empty shell.

67
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,240
You—

68
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:46,720
What do you mean?

69
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,270
I've already made arrangements.

70
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,720
No matter how this competition ends,

71
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,310
I've already transferred the company's assets

72
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,600
a long time ago.

73
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,510
And I did it under your name.

74
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,630
So you can take all the blame.

75
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:08,720
Not necessarily.

76
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,630
Miss Nuoyi.

77
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,480
Nuoyi.

78
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,430
Why is she here?

79
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,360
You took over our casino

80
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,870
and used it for money laundering.

81
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,830
But what you don't know is

82
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,560
we still have many people in the underground casino.

83
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:31,070
All the evidence of your crimes

84
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:32,830
is now in my hands.

85
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,560
Nuoyi, are you crazy?

86
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,360
What good does this do for you?

87
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,950
Good?

88
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,680
You killed my father.

89
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,480
I wish I could destroy every one of you.

90
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,560
Mo Panbi.

91
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,160
The accounts you transferred assets to

92
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:52,040
have already been frozen by my request.

93
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,070
And they're completely locked.

94
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,160
You—

95
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,240
Give that to me.

96
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:01,920
Give it to me!

97
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:03,600
Th-this...

98
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,720
Young Master Mo! Young Master Mo!

99
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:07,870
Young Master Mo, let's go!

100
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:08,950
Let's go!

101
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:17,480
You reap what you sow.

102
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:18,630
Thank you for helping me.

103
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,270
I didn't expect your father...

104
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,310
No need to thank me.

105
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,630
I just helped you along the way.

106
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,000
Thanks.

107
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,070
Mu Kun.

108
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,600
You can't escape today.

109
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,480
Miss Sun.

110
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,360
It's just a card game.

111
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,190
It won't cost anyone their life, right?

112
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,830
It's just a card game.

113
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,510
Then back then, you...

114
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,830
When you lost everything gambling and turned to robbery,

115
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:03,120
why didn't you spare my parents' lives?

116
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:17,830
No wonder you look more and more familiar.

117
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,510
You're that little...

118
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,360
little girl from back then.

119
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:25,630
Today,

120
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,000
I'll make you pay for your crimes with your own blood.

121
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:32,160
I had no choice back then.

122
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:35,070
I only wanted money, I didn't mean to kill anyone.

123
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:35,800
But...

124
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:38,000
your parents didn't cooperate at the time.

125
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,680
The loser of today's competition is this useless guy.

126
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,600
I, Mu Kun, will not lose.

127
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,510
To tell you the truth,

128
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,800
I've hidden a bomb here.

129
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:55,480
None of you are leaving today.

130
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,360
You'll all be blown up.

131
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:00,870
Stop!

132
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,390
Or I'll blow you all up.

133
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,360
Dad, the car is ready.

134
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,390
Alright, hurry!

135
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,560
Mu Kun, you...

136
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,000
Let go of me!

137
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:12,720
Behave yourself.

138
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:18,360
Let go of me.

139
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:18,800
Sit down.

140
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:20,310
Mu Kun.

141
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,160
I advise you to turn yourself in.

142
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,160
Don't keep making the same mistakes.

143
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,360
Turn yourself in.

144
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,360
Your master couldn't beat me.

145
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,160
You won't be able to beat me either.

146
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,830
This bomb

147
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:34,630
isn't like the one you brought last time.

148
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,910
This one will really explode.

149
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,480
What I owe you in this life

150
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,550
I'll repay you in the next.

151
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:56,960
Mu Kun.

152
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,150
Come back.

153
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,150
Come back.

154
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,750
Come back here!
