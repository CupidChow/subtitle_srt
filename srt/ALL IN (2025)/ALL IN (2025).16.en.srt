1
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:12,710
Sorry.

2
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:14,280
Lele is in their hands.

3
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,430
I've brought the person as you asked.

4
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,120
Where is my child?

5
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:21,310
Don't rush.

6
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,350
Soon I'll bury you all together.

7
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,510
You'll see each other very soon.

8
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,680
You didn't keep your word.

9
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,640
Where did you hide my child?

10
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,590
You don't really think

11
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,560
that by handing over the God of Gambling's apprentice to us

12
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:39,070
you'll get to live, do you?

13
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,480
Do it!

14
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:53,640
Don't move.

15
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:56,640
Don't move.

16
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:10,800
Thank you.

17
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,240
If you really want to thank me,

18
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,400
then hurry up and get a divorce.

19
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:15,960
and marry into my Naiwen family.

20
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,400
Wait, why are you here?

21
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:20,360
That nasty woman teamed up with you to trick me.

22
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,520
The child suddenly disappeared.

23
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,030
Her behavior was very strange.

24
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,400
I'm not an idiot.

25
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,000
Isn't it obvious?

26
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,000
You'll know when we get there.

27
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,520
Is Lele in danger?

28
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,400
Where did you hide Lele?

29
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,430
Tell me quickly, where is Lele?

30
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,910
You actually dared to trick me.

31
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:48,310
In this lifetime,

32
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,080
you can forget about ever knowing where your daughter is.

33
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,080
I'm begging you.

34
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,360
Where exactly is Lele?

35
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,400
I can't lose her again.

36
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,310
I'm begging you, please.

37
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:04,840
Get up first.

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,030
I'm begging you.

39
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:06,750
Get up.

40
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,120
Leave it to me.

41
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,000
What are you looking at?

42
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:18,630
Let me tell you,

43
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,910
you'll never get

44
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,240
any information from me.

45
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:22,630
Don't worry.

46
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,870
Making you talk will be as easy as eating.

47
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,470
Just wait and see.

48
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:30,840
Go.

49
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,520
Go.

50
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:33,800
Move.

51
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:34,840
Go.

52
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,400
If you know what's good for you, let me go now.

53
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,120
Otherwise, when Mu Kun comes looking,

54
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,430
you'll all be begging for mercy.

55
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,190
Stop wasting your time.

56
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,960
We're in this business,

57
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,910
and loyalty is what matters.

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I've already told you,

59
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:02,000
there's no way I'll give you any information.

60
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,910
Or,

61
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,240
if you spend a night with me,

62
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,150
maybe then,

63
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,190
I might tell you something.

64
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,590
The way I usually deal with prisoners

65
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:15,800
comes in three types.

66
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,360
The first one

67
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,120
is psychological torture.

68
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,240
For example, hanging them up,

69
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,870
with their feet barely touching the ground,

70
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,120
and keeping them awake for days and nights.

71
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,360
When they're at their weakest mentally,

72
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:28,480
that's when you test them.

73
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,600
This method

74
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:30,870
usually takes a long time.

75
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,070
I can't wait that long.

76
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,000
There's also a second method.

77
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,430
It's the one I prefer.

78
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,870
For example,

79
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,270
using physical torture.

80
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,630
Make them feel extreme pain,

81
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,070
and force the prisoner to give in.

82
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:44,920
But this method

83
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:46,870
really tests your technique.

84
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,920
It's all about knowing where it hurts the most.

85
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,830
But this method is really noisy.

86
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,000
I'm not a big fan of it.

87
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,830
Let me emphasize the third method for you.

88
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:05,390
Do you know what percentage of the human body is made up of blood?

89
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,630
About seven percent.

90
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,120
For someone muscular like you,

91
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,750
it could be around eight percent.

92
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,600
You might not know this,

93
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,430
but a person's blood

94
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,830
if you lose a third of it, you'll die.

95
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:19,390
I'll make sure you experience

96
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,680
something even more painful than death.

97
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,240
What are you going to do?

98
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,360
Xin Li.

99
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,560
Prepare the type O blood bags.

100
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:29,040
We'll draw blood while transfusing at the same time.

101
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,920
But before that,

102
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,870
I'll add another step.

103
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,390
When you're getting blood back,

104
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,480
I'll chill it with ice to lower your temperature.

105
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,480
If you can last an hour,

106
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:48,190
I'll consider you a real man.

107
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:49,160
You—

108
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,240
Don't you dare say

109
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:52,630
I haven't even started yet.

110
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,870
That would be no fun at all.

111
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,310
Xin Li.

112
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,630
I'll leave this to you.

113
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,270
Yes.

114
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,390
Let's go.

115
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,560
Miss Nuoyi

116
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,430
I was disrespectful before.

117
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:10,630
I offended you.

118
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,830
Please forgive me.

119
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,720
What’s wrong? Did I scare you?

120
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,310
Don’t worry.

121
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,510
I couldn’t bear to hurt you.

122
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,480
May I ask out of curiosity,

123
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,480
as a young lady,

124
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,000
how do you know all this?

125
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,560
It runs in the family.

126
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,070
He confessed so quickly.

127
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,480
That’s no fun, he just gave up.

128
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,390
Go save the child first.

129
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:43,800
Okay.

130
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,720
Lele, Mommy!

131
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,560
My child!

132
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,870
Come here, let Mommy see if you’re hurt.

133
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:17,630
I’m glad you’re okay.

134
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,160
I’m glad you’re okay.

135
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,390
Come here, Lele.

136
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,430
Sit here for now.

137
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:26,870
Haoyun

138
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,750
Thank you.

139
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:29,720
It’s nothing.

140
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:32,120
As long as you and Lele are safe.

141
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:34,310
It’s not like we’re really married.

142
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,560
Just go through the motions.

143
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,120
I just can’t bear to part with Lele.

144
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:42,390
I haven’t taken her out for good food these days.

145
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:44,950
If you really can’t bear to part with Lele,

146
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,800
then you two should hurry up and have one of your own.

147
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:56,600
By the way, Haoyun,

148
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,510
because of Lele,

149
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,510
I had no choice

150
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:03,560
but to reveal that you are a cruise ship survivor.

151
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,600
I told them about it.

152
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,430
I'm sorry.

153
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:09,560
Can you tell me everything now?

154
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,800
Actually, I'm not very sure myself.

155
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,920
I only know that your gambling skills are incredible.

156
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,240
Haoyun, let's leave this place.

157
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,430
Let's go live somewhere else.

158
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,600
Lele, let's go.

159
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,320
Goodbye, Dad. Goodbye, Auntie.

160
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:45,750
Dad, Dad!

161
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,240
Dad, listen to me!

162
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:47,840
Dad!

163
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:49,080
Dad!

164
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:49,870
Dad!

165
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:53,840
Dad!

166
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,670
What a useless person.

167
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,000
You’ve alerted them too soon.

168
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,750
How am I supposed to catch them now?

169
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:10,840
Dad!

170
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,150
I have another idea.

171
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,600
We can force the "Golden Finger" to show up.

172
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,150
Speak.

173
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,910
There's a gambling addict named Hao Youqian.

174
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,320
He often comes to our place to gamble.

175
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,670
He always loses everything.

176
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,080
So?

177
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,910
Good luck is in their shop.

178
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,480
And good luck is also closely tied to his daughter.

179
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,870
They have a very close relationship.

180
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:33,510
If we can trick his daughter into coming here,

181
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,320
we can definitely force good luck to appear.

182
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:42,750
Alright.

183
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,480
Then let's change our approach.

184
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:53,750
A gambler's family should be reunited.

185
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:55,670
Once we have him under control,

186
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:59,510
good luck will come to us naturally.
