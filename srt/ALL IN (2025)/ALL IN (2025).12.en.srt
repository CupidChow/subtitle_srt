1
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,070
Jinjin, what are you doing?

2
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,640
Just leave.

3
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:04,870
Go stay at another woman's place.

4
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:09,790
Why do you have to go to Peng Sai's party?

5
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:11,760
Don't you know what kind of person he is?

6
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:13,920
I don't know what kind of person he is.

7
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:16,150
But I know exactly what kind of person you are now.

8
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,590
I found these stockings on your sofa bed.

9
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:22,350
You went from my shop to the karaoke room.

10
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,710
Lucky Bro, you really know how to have fun.

11
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:26,950
No, that's not it.

12
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,310
And also,

13
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,280
Last night wasn't what you think at all.

14
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:31,680
They were drugged.

15
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,640
I was saving them.

16
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,200
You even drugged them?

17
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:35,920
No, the drug was meant for you.

18
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:36,760
What?

19
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,950
No, Peng Sai was the one who drugged you.

20
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,150
But somehow, they ended up drinking it.

21
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:42,680
It's Peng Sai again.

22
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,430
Lucky Bro.

23
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:46,640
Why are you always targeting Peng Sai?

24
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:49,150
If you can show evidence like last time,

25
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,120
then I'll believe you.

26
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,000
Fine, you don't have any, do you?

27
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,790
Then get out of the shop right now.

28
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,400
Why are you still hanging around?

29
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:00,120
Dad.

30
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,760
What are you two doing?

31
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,120
You should ask him.

32
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:06,230
Daughter.

33
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:07,680
I'm sorry.

34
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,430
Dad lost everything again.

35
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,870
I'm begging you, please help me.

36
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,360
Lucky Bro, please help me too.

37
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,630
I'm begging you both.

38
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,590
Didn't you say you quit gambling?

39
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:20,190
I'm sorry, Dad is sorry to you.

40
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:20,960
Enough.

41
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,400
Hao Youqian.

42
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,560
It wasn't easy for me to leave you.

43
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,150
I finally started my own new life.

44
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,120
Why do you have to come and ruin it?

45
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,310
I've made it very clear to you.

46
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,430
I've completely cut ties with you.

47
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,750
Even if you die out there,

48
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,680
I absolutely won't help you this time.

49
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,710
Daughter, listen to your dad.

50
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,430
It's all Dad's fault.

51
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,800
Dad is a jerk.

52
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,800
But this time, Dad has really realized his mistakes.

53
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,520
I'm begging you, save me this time.

54
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,710
Just this once.

55
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:51,470
I promise I'll never gamble again.

56
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,400
I'll let you handle all the money.

57
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,470
Daughter.

58
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:55,910
Daughter.

59
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,000
Alright, alright, alright.

60
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,960
Good luck, brother.

61
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,240
I'm the one who saved you.

62
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,430
I'm the one who took you in.

63
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,560
Did you forget?

64
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,470
I'm begging you, save me.

65
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,960
Please, help me.

66
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:06,960
Please, Jinjin.

67
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,280
Please save me.

68
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,870
I'm begging you, I really know I was wrong.

69
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,280
Alright, alright.

70
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,590
You can make a scene, you can argue,

71
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:15,870
but he's still your father.

72
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:17,870
Hurry up and bring two hundred thousand dollars.

73
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,000
Come to this address to ransom him.

74
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,470
Or I'll stab him in the kidney.

75
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,000
Let's go.

76
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:29,560
You can go ahead and kill him.

77
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,910
I won't go to ransom him.

78
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:34,960
Why aren't you leaving yet?

79
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,280
Get out of here!

80
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,960
How about I give it a try?

81
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,560
See if I can get Uncle Youqian out.

82
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,710
You can go.

83
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,150
I don't need your help.

84
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,360
I don't want to save him either.

85
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,680
But he did save me once.

86
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,750
I owe him that favor.

87
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:44,560
Boss.

88
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,310
There's someone sneaking around outside the casino.

89
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,240
Speak.

90
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,360
What are you here for?

91
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,950
I'm here to exchange for Uncle Youqian.

92
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,480
Let him go.

93
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:55,800
I'll stay here as collateral.

94
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,390
Kid,

95
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,680
we run a casino,

96
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,190
not a human trafficking ring.

97
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,510
But Uncle Youqian is old,

98
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,040
his body is already worn out.

99
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,480
Selling his old kidneys

100
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,920
would be cheating the buyers, wouldn't it?

101
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,920
How about giving me a few days to raise the money instead?

102
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:10,950
Let him go.

103
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,270
We can let him go,

104
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,190
but you have to gamble your kidney with me.

105
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:20,430
If you win,

106
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,360
I'll let him go.

107
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:25,390
What?

108
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,000
Are you scared?

109
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,310
Fine.

110
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,510
I'll gamble.

111
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,270
Alright.

112
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,360
Let's keep it simple.

113
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,120
Guess odd or even.

114
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,190
Grab a handful of sunflower seeds

115
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:51,750
Guess whether the number of seeds inside is odd or even

116
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,040
You can feel the weight before placing your bet

117
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,800
By the weight of the seeds and the cup

118
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,750
you can judge the number of seeds

119
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,600
This isn't hard at all

120
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,310
The cup weighs about forty-five grams

121
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,750
One seed weighs about zero point two five grams

122
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:23,600
Eight

123
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,830
It's eight seeds

124
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,000
So, what do you think?

125
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:32,240
Have you decided?

126
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,160
Odd or even?

127
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,120
Even

128
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,800
Then let's reveal it

129
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,830
Seven pieces

130
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,510
Odd number

131
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,480
How is that possible?

132
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,920
It clearly weighs as much as eight pieces.

133
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,000
You're cheating.

134
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,600
Young man

135
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,950
Is this your first time at a casino?

136
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,160
Casinos are places where people cheat.

137
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,160
If you gamble, you must accept the outcome.

138
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:13,160
Someone, cut out his kidney.

139
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,480
You're cheating.

140
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:17,920
Wait

141
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,630
Let's bet one more round.

142
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:20,920
What do you have left to bet?

143
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,680
I still have my heart, liver, spleen, and lungs.

144
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:23,870
Do you dare to bet?

145
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:25,950
Kidney

146
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,160
Kidney, kidney

147
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,720
My kidney, mine

148
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,390
M-my, my kidney

149
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,070
My kidney

150
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:36,750
My kidney

151
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:37,240
Let's go

152
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,950
My kidney

153
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,430
Sorry about that

154
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,070
The equipment is a bit crude

155
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,070
Don't mind it

156
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,190
So, do you still want to bet?

157
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,240
Yes, I'll bet

158
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,430
You clearly know we're cheating

159
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,510
Why do you still want to bet?

160
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,950
No matter what

161
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,600
Uncle Youqian and the others saved my life

162
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,480
Even if I have to risk my life

163
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:06,870
I still have to make this bet

164
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:08,630
Alright

165
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,480
I'll make it quick for you

166
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,630
I guess odd

167
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:50,550
Kid, you've got some skills

168
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,960
But you're still too young.

169
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,030
I'm definitely going to win this round.

170
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,390
In the casino,

171
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,360
winning and losing

172
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,910
are decided by the house.

173
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,630
Is that so?

174
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,390
Then do you dare to raise the stakes?

175
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,120
If I lose,

176
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:11,030
you can take any valuable organ from my body.

177
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,120
If I win,

178
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,600
I want to leave safely with Uncle Youqian.

179
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,240
Young man,

180
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:22,390
I admire your courage and character.

181
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,120
But

182
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,670
you will surely pay for your recklessness and ignorance.

183
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,120
You will pay the price.

184
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,480
What a pity.

185
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:36,910
No one has ever beaten me in my casino.
