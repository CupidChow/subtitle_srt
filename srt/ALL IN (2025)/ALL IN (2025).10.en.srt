1
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:58,320
Manman

2
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,560
Jinjin, hurry and come with me.

3
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:13,560
Quick, quick, quick!

4
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,719
Let go of me.

5
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,239
Why are you following me?

6
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,599
Go find your Miss Sun.

7
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:20,959
No time to explain, just come with me.

8
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:22,519
You're in danger right now.

9
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:23,519
I just saw him slip you something.

10
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:24,480
I told you,

11
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,079
my business is none of your concern.

12
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:27,560
What's wrong?

13
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,040
What's wrong?

14
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,879
Jinjin, let's go!

15
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,599
What are you doing?

16
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:34,799
Take your dirty hands off me.

17
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,159
Remove your dirty hands.

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,159
Is he bothering you again?

19
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,879
Now get out of here.

20
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:43,719
Did you hear me?

21
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:46,200
Someone, come here!

22
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,000
Why should I leave?

23
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:52,799
Can't I spend money here?

24
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,319
Spend money?

25
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,879
Did I hear that right? You came to spend money?

26
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:58,239
Here, even a single bottle of wine—

27
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,599
It costs over ten thousand dollars.

28
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:01,480
Even if you work hard for a whole month,

29
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:02,719
could you even afford half a bottle?

30
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:04,359
Besides,

31
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:06,680
this club is members-only.

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,879
How did you get in?

33
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:10,960
I remember now.

34
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,719
Our working-class friend here

35
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:15,800
is best at sneaky, shady things.

36
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,400
Isn't that right?

37
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:19,360
Let me tell you,

38
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,759
get out of here.

39
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:21,639
Otherwise,

40
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:23,960
I'll have security take you to the police station.

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,639
You can stay there for a few days.

42
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:26,439
Who ends up in the station isn't certain yet.

43
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:27,680
Jinjin,

44
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,840
I just saw him have someone drug you.

45
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,719
He wants to hurt you.

46
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,120
That's not true.

47
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:34,280
Jinjin, don't listen to his nonsense.

48
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:34,960
Impossible.

49
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,400
I'll drink it right now to show you.

50
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,199
Let's see if he really put something in it.

51
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,639
If I pass out in a bit

52
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,240
or if anything happens to me,

53
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:52,199
don't worry about me, just run.

54
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:07,560
How is that possible?

55
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,919
I clearly saw it just now.

56
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:11,639
Do you think I'm like you,

57
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:13,919
someone with a filthy mind?

58
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:16,560
I think you just came here to mooch some drinks.

59
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:17,240
Am I right?

60
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,919
Let me tell you, Jinjin,

61
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,319
this person is rotten to the core.

62
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,439
I'll help you kick him out.

63
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,479
Throw him out for me.

64
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:30,719
Jinjin, trust me.

65
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:32,080
I really saw it just now.

66
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,039
He drugged you.

67
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,199
Jinjin, hurry and leave!

68
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:39,879
You can serve the drinks now.

69
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:53,759
What should we do with this guy?

70
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:55,639
Should I just dig a hole and bury him?

71
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,240
Go ahead and dig, aren't you tired?

72
00:03:58,599 --> 00:03:59,879
Why not just throw him into the sea?

73
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,560
Hurry up.

74
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,560
That's true.

75
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,240
Wait.

76
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:04,840
Miss Sun.

77
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,719
Miss Sun.

78
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,560
I want this person.

79
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,080
Boss Peng Sai told us to handle this.

80
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,879
I said I want this person.

81
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,480
Which word didn't you understand?

82
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:17,879
I wouldn't dare.

83
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,639
I'll leave right away.

84
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,480
Miss Sun, untie me quickly.

85
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,560
I need to find Jinjin.

86
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:40,399
I...

87
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,920
You want me to let you go?

88
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,120
Fine.

89
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,240
But you owe me a favor.

90
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:49,439
Okay, okay, okay.

91
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,480
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

92
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,000
Come out.

93
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,279
Thank you.

94
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,800
Jinjin, please be safe.

95
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:10,879
Jinjin, please don't let anything happen to you.

96
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,319
Hey, Sister Nuoyi,

97
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,480
your underground casino is really hard to find.

98
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:44,600
Let me tell you,

99
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,759
that guy needs to disappear from Laiwan for me.

100
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,000
I don't care if he ends up feeding the fish in the sea

101
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:51,800
or getting fat in the mountains,

102
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,560
either way is fine.

103
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,199
Who are you talking about?

104
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,439
I'm talking about that worker named Haoyun.

105
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:00,399
No.

106
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,120
Are you playing dumb with me?

107
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,920
You were the one who wanted to protect him before.

108
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:05,040
You wouldn't let me touch him.

109
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,040
Now he's getting close with Sun Yiqian.

110
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,000
If this keeps up,

111
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,480
I'll be kicked out of the Sun Group.

112
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,439
Sister, look,

113
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,519
once I take over the Sun Group,

114
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:29,759
I'll keep my promise as I said before

115
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,480
and let you run the casino.

116
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,360
Since you want to protect him,

117
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:37,319
then help me become friends with him.

118
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:38,319
That's fine too.

119
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:40,959
Right.

120
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,680
That guy is now with Sun Yiqian

121
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,079
developing a relationship at the club.

122
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,519
As long as you help me win him over,

123
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,959
the promise I made to you before

124
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,920
will still be fulfilled.

125
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:00,879
Young Master Mo Panbi,

126
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:03,959
I always thought we were just business partners.

127
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,319
Are you telling me how to do things?

128
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:10,120
No, no, Sister,

129
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:11,279
I wouldn't dare.

130
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:12,360
Well then...

131
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:21,480
Well, sis,

132
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:22,319
Well then,

133
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,879
You, you drink first.

134
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,800
I won't bother you anymore.

135
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,360
Why did you tear it up?

136
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,680
Boss, didn't you say you didn't want to go?

137
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,399
Now even you want to tell me what to do?

138
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:47,000
No.

139
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:11,959
Okay.

140
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:12,720
Come on, come on.

141
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,720
President Peng Sai,

142
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:15,319
I really can't drink anymore.

143
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:16,120
It's okay, this wine tastes terrible.

144
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:16,879
Just one last small glass.

145
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,759
Just the last small glass.

146
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:18,360
Alright, here we go.

147
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,040
Come on, Jin Jin, you can do it!

148
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,279
Well done.

149
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,199
That's great.

150
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,000
How do you feel?
