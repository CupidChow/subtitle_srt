1
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:54,320
No!

2
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:55,399
No, stop! Please, no!

3
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:56,799
Stop!

4
00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:57,200
Dad!

5
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,000
My finger!

6
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:05,640
Dad!

7
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,720
What will it take for you to let my dad go?

8
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:12,959
Your dad owes me this amount.

9
00:01:13,399 --> 00:01:15,080
Th-thirty million?

10
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,119
Thirty million.

11
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:16,679
No.

12
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,080
I don't have that much!

13
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:19,519
What about the interest?

14
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,800
If you don't pay, I'll cut off your hand.

15
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:23,720
Brother Long...

16
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,159
I really don't have that much money left.

17
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:27,879
Even if you cut off all my fingers,

18
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:28,879
I still don't have that much.

19
00:01:29,679 --> 00:01:30,239
How about this—

20
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,000
I'll give you my restaurant as collateral.

21
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,399
How much is that rundown restaurant of yours even worth?

22
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:36,440
Someone, come here!

23
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,840
Cut off his hand first, then we'll talk.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,800
Wait! Wait!

25
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,519
Brother Long!

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,159
What do you think of my daughter?

27
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:43,759
No way.

28
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:44,560
Dad!

29
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:47,519
You really know how to scheme.

30
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,840
Trying to use your daughter to pay off my thirty million?

31
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:58,920
But she could cover part of the interest.

32
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,599
That, we can discuss.

33
00:02:11,679 --> 00:02:12,679
I'll pay off this gambling debt.

34
00:02:13,279 --> 00:02:15,200
Thirty million it is.

35
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,119
Why should I believe you can pay it back?

36
00:02:20,399 --> 00:02:21,920
It's not about whether you believe me.

37
00:02:22,399 --> 00:02:23,399
It's about giving you a choice.

38
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:24,880
Either I pay the debt,

39
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:26,519
or the debt dies with the person.

40
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,080
No, no, please don't!

41
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,360
Alright.

42
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,160
I'll give you one week.

43
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:35,640
If I don't see thirty million in a week,

44
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,880
it won't be settled with just a finger.

45
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,040
You all better be careful.

46
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,399
Why didn't you step in just now?

47
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:43,600
Let's go.

48
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,959
Good luck, brother.

49
00:02:51,399 --> 00:02:53,439
Can you help me pick up my finger first?

50
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,519
I heard

51
00:02:55,239 --> 00:02:56,920
that if you sew it back on at the hospital, you can still use it.

52
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,160
You lousy wage earner.

53
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,719
Go ahead and play the hero if you want.

54
00:03:14,119 --> 00:03:15,839
Why are you holding a knife to my neck?

55
00:03:16,559 --> 00:03:17,600
You already owe millions.

56
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,200
Yet you insisted on promising them thirty million.

57
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:21,279
I'm telling you,

58
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:22,439
you're the one who has to pay this money back.

59
00:03:26,559 --> 00:03:27,600
I—I...

60
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:28,880
I...

61
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,439
I...

62
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:34,320
Dad.

63
00:03:34,679 --> 00:03:36,160
This is clearly your own mess.

64
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,640
What does it have to do with Brother Haoyun?

65
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,760
Besides,

66
00:03:39,999 --> 00:03:41,119
if it weren't for Brother Haoyun,

67
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:42,480
you wouldn't even have your hand anymore.

68
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,239
You...

69
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,999
What's wrong? What's going on?

70
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:53,559
Didn't I already tell you?

71
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,600
When you're in Laiwan,

72
00:03:55,399 --> 00:03:56,999
if you run into trouble, don't wander around.

73
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,040
Boss Peng Sai will help you handle it.

74
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,360
What happened to your hand?

75
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,360
I...

76
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:06,880
Is there a financial problem?

77
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,920
You should've said so earlier.

78
00:04:11,119 --> 00:04:11,719
Dad.

79
00:04:11,839 --> 00:04:13,480
Why do you have to tell everyone everything?

80
00:04:14,559 --> 00:04:15,759
Boss Peng Sai isn't an outsider.

81
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,520
Once you marry him,

82
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,480
we'll all be family.

83
00:04:20,559 --> 00:04:21,239
Jinjin,

84
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,879
when it comes to feelings,

85
00:04:23,239 --> 00:04:25,679
I'm truly sincere with you.

86
00:04:28,239 --> 00:04:31,360
Just let me do a bit more for you.

87
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,160
Where else could you find someone as good as Boss Peng Sai?

88
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,199
Jinjin, just marry Boss Peng Sai.

89
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,319
Dad.

90
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,319
Boss Peng Sai is almost as old as you.

91
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:48,400
What do you know?

92
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:50,319
A man three years older is like holding a mountain of gold.

93
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,480
Dad, hurry and give the check back to Mr. Peng Sai.

94
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:55,920
Without this check,

95
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,119
where are we going to find thirty million?

96
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,439
What are you doing?

97
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:00,280
Give it to me.

98
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,280
What are you doing?

99
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,079
Give it to me, you—

100
00:05:02,239 --> 00:05:03,559
Uncle, just accept it.

101
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,119
You all—

102
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,600
Why—why did you tear up the check?

103
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,480
This—this—

104
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,239
Once it's torn up, it's void.

105
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,360
I have to—I have to—

106
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,160
Go to the bank and—

107
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:14,800
The bank is probably closed now.

108
00:05:14,999 --> 00:05:16,360
I'll see if I can get another one issued.

109
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:16,960
Don't worry.

110
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:17,879
Let's go.

111
00:05:17,999 --> 00:05:18,360
No, no—

112
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,720
Mr. Peng Sai, Mr. Peng Sai—

113
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:20,960
This—

114
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,040
I—

115
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:26,280
I—I'm—

116
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:28,999
It wasn't easy to find someone to pay our debt.

117
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:30,520
It's all your fault.

118
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,199
From now on,

119
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,280
I'll really call you

120
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,079
Bad luck.

121
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,119
I wasn't the one who ruined the check.

122
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:39,119
Mr. Peng Sai never intended to give you the check.

123
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:40,559
Can't you see that?

124
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,759
Nonsense!

125
00:05:42,119 --> 00:05:44,040
My—my check—

126
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,239
I—I—

127
00:05:46,119 --> 00:05:46,319
I—

128
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,199
Hao Youqian!

129
00:05:47,559 --> 00:05:48,160
If it weren't for your gambling,

130
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:49,920
would our lives be like this?

131
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:52,759
Fine.

132
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:54,360
You two eat my food and drink my drinks,

133
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:54,999
and wear my clothes.

134
00:05:55,679 --> 00:05:57,400
And you, ungrateful woman, still side with outsiders.

135
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,600
I'll sell you right now to pay off my debts.

136
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,520
Stop!

137
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,439
What are you doing?

138
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,840
I'm warning you.

139
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:09,999
You're an outsider.

140
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,160
Stay out of our family business.

141
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:11,639
Shut up.

142
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,679
This thirty million,

143
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:15,319
I'll figure out a way.

144
00:06:15,999 --> 00:06:16,480
Okay.

145
00:06:16,679 --> 00:06:17,679
You said it yourself.

146
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:23,199
Boss.

147
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:24,840
Are we going to the bank?

148
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,999
What bank?

149
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,040
Didn't you just say inside

150
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:29,480
that you were going to the bank to cover the check?

151
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,239
I didn't even touch it.

152
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:34,879
You really expect me to pay up?

153
00:06:35,679 --> 00:06:36,800
What are you thinking?

154
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,400
I wonder if the gift I gave

155
00:06:44,559 --> 00:06:45,960
is something Miss Sun likes.

156
00:06:49,239 --> 00:06:50,119
Miss Sun.

157
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:52,639
Good luck.

158
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:54,840
Why are you here?

159
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,280
This pork is for you.

160
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:59,559
I ordered it yesterday through a small restaurant.

161
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,600
It's absolutely fresh.

162
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:04,840
What guy gives a girl pork belly as a gift?

163
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,119
Last time I saw you, you looked too thin.

164
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:09,040
Eat something with some fat to nourish yourself.

165
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:10,520
Good luck.

166
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,360
Am I so poor I can't even afford meat now?

167
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:17,879
Alright.

168
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:18,960
Stop talking about me.

169
00:07:19,999 --> 00:07:22,759
You said you came here today because you figured things out.

170
00:07:23,119 --> 00:07:24,079
And you wanted to help me out.

171
00:07:24,239 --> 00:07:24,720
No.

172
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,119
Well, yes and no.

173
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,439
I just wanted to see

174
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:31,720
if there’s any work I can do.

175
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:33,360
Anything except gambling.

176
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:35,160
I can be a cleaner, a driver,

177
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,319
do odd jobs, run errands, anything.

178
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,319
I urgently need some money right now.

179
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,239
If I could get an advance on my salary, that would be great.

180
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,480
If you’re in trouble, just tell me.

181
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,319
I’ll help you sort it out.

182
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,559
We can talk about gambling later.

183
00:07:49,679 --> 00:07:51,879
Jinjin’s family owes thirty million in gambling debts.

184
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,920
What’s that got to do with me?

185
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,559
If it’s not paid in a week, someone could get killed.

186
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,559
US dollars?

187
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:01,439
Laibi.

188
00:08:02,679 --> 00:08:03,879
Thirty million Laibi.

189
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:05,280
I thought it was more than that.

190
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:06,879
I can’t fix this.

191
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,520
Why not?

192
00:08:12,119 --> 00:08:13,559
I know these people all too well.

193
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:15,800
Today I lend you money,

194
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,079
you use it to pay off their gambling debts.

195
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,480
Tomorrow, they lose at gambling again,

196
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,400
and end up owing a ton of money.

197
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,759
And the day after that?

198
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:21,879
You'll come to me again,

199
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:23,199
working yourself to the bone to pay for them.

200
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,439
Hopeless gamblers deserve to die in the casino.

201
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,280
But their families are innocent.

202
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:29,999
If you hate gambling so much,

203
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,199
why do you run a casino?

204
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,599
Why do you participate in

205
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:33,920
that so-called charity poker tournament?

206
00:08:34,319 --> 00:08:36,199
Isn't it because of people like you who run casinos

207
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,719
that there are so many hopeless gamblers?

208
00:08:42,079 --> 00:08:42,679
Get out!

209
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,640
What's wrong with what I said?

210
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,880
Where are you going?

211
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:00,599
Bomb.

212
00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:01,559
No.

213
00:09:02,439 --> 00:09:03,120
I can't afford it.

214
00:09:04,319 --> 00:09:05,000
I can't afford it.

215
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:07,559
I'm back.

216
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,160
Lucky Brother!

217
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,479
Weren't you going to find a solution?

218
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,520
Why is it so little?

219
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,439
I haven't figured out a way yet.

220
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:26,520
I knew it.

221
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,679
You're just a worker, why act tough?

222
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,400
Do you think you're President Peng Sai?

223
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:31,679
Do you have his abilities?

224
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,439
Dad.

225
00:09:33,199 --> 00:09:35,199
Lucky Brother is also trying to help us.

226
00:09:35,319 --> 00:09:36,439
How can you say that about him?

227
00:09:36,599 --> 00:09:37,679
Why are you defending him so much?

228
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,559
President Peng Sai said

229
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,520
he'll take care of the thirty million.

230
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:47,559
I'm warning you.

231
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,760
Don't even think about reaching above your station.

232
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,280
My daughter is going to marry into a wealthy family.

233
00:09:53,079 --> 00:09:53,760
Good luck.

234
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:56,760
Who are you people?

235
00:09:57,599 --> 00:10:00,040
I'm Pacha, head of security for the Sun family.

236
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,959
I'm here to take someone.

237
00:10:02,719 --> 00:10:03,599
The Sun family?

238
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,599
You've gotten yourself into even bigger trouble than I have.

239
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,120
The Sun family is extremely powerful in Laiwan.

240
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:11,559
You actually dared to cross them?

241
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:12,599
I...

242
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,520
I didn't!

243
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:14,479
No, I didn't.

244
00:10:14,719 --> 00:10:16,839
You must have lost money at the Sun family's casino.

245
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,160
Now they're here to collect, aren't they?

246
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:20,800
Take him away.

247
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:21,679
Let's go.

248
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:22,760
Where are you taking him?

249
00:10:23,479 --> 00:10:25,520
Here, you can have him.

250
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
We don't even know him.

251
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:27,599
Let's go.

252
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,520
What are you doing? Ignore that guy.

253
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:31,839
Go, go, go—get inside.

254
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:32,359
But...

255
00:10:32,719 --> 00:10:33,959
No, go back.

256
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:35,359
Get inside.

257
00:10:37,599 --> 00:10:38,400
Go, go.

258
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,000
What are you doing?

259
00:10:39,479 --> 00:10:40,000
You, you...

260
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,839
What are you guys doing?

261
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:48,400
You wait outside.

262
00:10:48,599 --> 00:10:49,479
I have something to say to him.

263
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,400
Uncle Pacha.

264
00:10:52,599 --> 00:10:54,240
Miss is alone with that guy.

265
00:10:54,359 --> 00:10:55,240
Could it be dangerous?

266
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,079
Is that any of your concern?

267
00:10:58,679 --> 00:10:59,760
I've already thought it through.

268
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,359
As long as you're willing,

269
00:11:01,359 --> 00:11:03,319
to help me participate in the charity poker tournament,

270
00:11:03,599 --> 00:11:05,079
I'll not only help you pay off your debt,

271
00:11:05,479 --> 00:11:07,120
but also give you the shop on Gold Street you want.

272
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,160
No.

273
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:09,800
Anything but gambling.

274
00:11:10,199 --> 00:11:11,199
Anything else is fine.

275
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,439
You...

276
00:11:18,479 --> 00:11:19,400
Then...

277
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:26,640
just cooperate with me and finish this act.

278
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:28,479
Keep pretending to be my fiancé.

279
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,599
What are you doing?

280
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:37,880
Don't be like this.

281
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,319
I-I don't fall for this.

282
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:41,640
Don't do anything crazy.

283
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,479
Don't be nervous, just behave.

284
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,000
It'll be over in a moment.

285
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,719
What are you looking at?

286
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,479
Miss is really going all out to sign that guy.

287
00:11:56,599 --> 00:11:57,800
She's making a big sacrifice.

288
00:11:58,199 --> 00:11:58,839
Shut up.

289
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,400
Yes.

290
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,800
Ow, ow, ow!

291
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,679
A contract of servitude?

292
00:12:05,719 --> 00:12:06,479
I don't want to—Fine, I'll sign.

293
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,120
Now you belong to me.

294
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:07,959
No!

295
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:10,439
You have to do whatever I say.

296
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,439
Let me go!

297
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,559
Help! Help!

298
00:12:17,479 --> 00:12:18,319
I'm not signing!

299
00:12:18,319 --> 00:12:18,959
Something's wrong, Miss!

300
00:12:19,199 --> 00:12:20,439
Someone is causing trouble at the casino!

301
00:12:54,359 --> 00:12:55,520
Another three of a kind.

302
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:56,400
Three of a kind.

303
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,400
That's incredible.

304
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:01,719
This woman...

305
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,880
She only played ten rounds.

306
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,520
She's almost won all the casino's money.

307
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,199
Who exactly is this woman?

308
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,520
You don't even know that?

309
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,880
She's Nuo Yi.

310
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,160
Her gambling skills are ranked third in Southeast Asia.

311
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:12,880
That's amazing.
