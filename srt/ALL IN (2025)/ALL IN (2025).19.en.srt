1
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:55,470
Boss

2
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,030
This kid has been winning all night.

3
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,000
I suspect he's cheating.

4
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:59,070
Should we cut off his hands?

5
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,230
Mr. Landon

6
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,590
How about we make a bet?

7
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:07,950
If I win,

8
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,640
you let my master, the God of Gambling, go.

9
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:10,870
If I lose,

10
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,150
these hands of mine are yours.

11
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,510
Who is the God of Gambling?

12
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,230
The God of Gambling's skills are unmatched in Southeast Asia.

13
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,040
Twenty years ago, he dominated all of Europe and America.

14
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:20,870
He had no rivals.

15
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,680
The only one who could stand alongside him

16
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,200
was the king of gambling, Mu Kun.

17
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:27,840
Who knows if what happened twenty years ago is true or not?

18
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,310
As for Mu Kun's gambling skills,

19
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,590
when it comes to Mr. Landon,

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,790
he could only bow his head and admit defeat.

21
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:39,920
Your master is with Mu Kun.

22
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,870
If you want to see Mu Kun, you have to get past me first.

23
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:42,840
But

24
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:46,120
what makes you think you can gamble with me?

25
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,070
I may not have anything else,

26
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,430
but I have plenty of money.

27
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:56,680
I'm asking you,

28
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:59,840
what gives you the right to gamble with me?

29
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:10,360
How about my life? Is that enough?

30
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,150
Mr. Landon

31
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,470
In our gambling world,

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,310
we settle things at the table.

33
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:25,310
The money is right here on the table.

34
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,960
Do you dare to bet?

35
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,710
You've got guts, kid.

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,590
Then let's play showdown.

37
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,590
Deal the cards.

38
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,910
Boss Langdon

39
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,430
How about we settle this in one round?

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,680
Chickened out.

41
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,360
I really like your style.

42
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:18,960
All in.

43
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:23,800
Fold.

44
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:25,470
Fold.

45
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,240
You only have a pair of threes.

46
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,400
And you're still barking here, trying to mess with me?

47
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,000
A pair of threes.

48
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,630
Damn.

49
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,840
You guys are cheating!

50
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,800
What makes you think I'm cheating?

51
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,270
What's wrong?

52
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,720
Even the God of Gambling's apprentice makes excuses when he loses?

53
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:30,360
Since ancient times, nine out of ten gamblers cheat.

54
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,630
You're not just setting up the game,

55
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,240
you want to win all the money on the table,

56
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,360
and even take everyone's money on this ship.

57
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,480
The ship is yours,

58
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,800
the dealer is yours too.

59
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,270
You already know what cards will be dealt next.

60
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,390
It's all been arranged, hasn't it?

61
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:48,950
Deal the cards.

62
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,950
The next five cards to be dealt are:

63
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,160
Five of Hearts,

64
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,390
Queen of Clubs,

65
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,510
Ace of Diamonds,

66
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,070
Seven of Diamonds,

67
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,070
Nine of Spades.

68
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,720
Hu, you dare set us up?

69
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:19,750
You—

70
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,950
Don't think just because we're overseas

71
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,480
you can treat us like pigs to be slaughtered.

72
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,120
Shut up!

73
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,680
Or I'll throw all of you into the sea.

74
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,870
Swim back to China on your own.

75
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,680
This only proves

76
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,190
you really are the God of Gambling's apprentice.

77
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,630
Your gambling skills are impressive.

78
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,600
But you should know the rules at the table.

79
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,390
If you can't catch someone cheating in the act, the bet still stands.

80
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,600
Do you dare reveal your cards?

81
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,600
I don't need to show my cards.

82
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:53,720
I'll beat you with just a pair of threes on the table.

83
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,480
Are you saying

84
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,510
you're going to beat my straight flush with a pair of threes?

85
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,040
Where's my ten of spades?

86
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,480
If we were playing Dou Dizhu,

87
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,680
you'd have the highest straight.

88
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,630
But now, you're nothing.

89
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:23,120
Even my small pair of threes is enough to beat you.

90
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:26,510
Mr. Landon, you lost.

91
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,190
When did you

92
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,920
switch my cards?

93
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,510
You cheated. This doesn't count.

94
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,120
The rule at the gambling table is,

95
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,720
if you can't catch someone in the act,

96
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,600
the bet still stands.

97
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,310
You said it yourself.

98
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:52,270
You...

99
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,000
Mr. Landon.

100
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,830
Lost and now you want to back out?

101
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,240
Take me to see Mukun.

102
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,560
Then I'll let you go.

103
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,240
You're awake.

104
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,920
Who... who are you?

105
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,800
I'm Qianqian.

106
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,000
Uncle Pacha, he's awake!

107
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:44,950
Where am I?

108
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,160
This is my home.

109
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:48,480
Are you feeling better?

110
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,630
What happened to me?

111
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,750
You were injured by Mukun.

112
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,070
You were unconscious all night.

113
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,000
I was really worried about you.

114
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,240
Mukun...

115
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,510
Where's my master?

116
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,390
Master?

117
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,360
What do you mean, your master?

118
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:02,510
My master, the God of Gambling.

119
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,680
God of Gambling?

120
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:09,120
I heard the God of Gambling lost to Mukun in a gambling match.

121
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:12,360
He died on a cruise ship that exploded and sank.

122
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:13,160
Impossible!

123
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,630
How could my master, the God of Gambling, lose?

124
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,240
Where are you going?

125
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,070
You're still not fully recovered.

126
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,950
It'll be dangerous if you leave the Sun family.

127
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:23,430
I need to find someone.

128
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,510
Jinjin.

129
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,870
She's safe now.

130
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:28,360
You don't need to worry about her.

131
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:29,310
Okay.

132
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,430
Who's Jinjin?

133
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,960
You're joking with me, right?

134
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,670
You don't remember me?

135
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,150
Even though I don't know why I'm here,

136
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,790
did we know each other before?
