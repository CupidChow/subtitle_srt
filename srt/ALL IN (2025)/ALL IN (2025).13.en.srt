1
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:56,150
Unfortunately, no one has ever managed in my casino

2
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,280
to beat me.

3
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:04,040
What?

4
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:06,510
This...

5
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,400
I know your cheating methods.

6
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,040
There's a scale on the table.

7
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,040
You use it to weigh and figure out the number of seeds.

8
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:14,950
And one of the seeds has a magnet inside.

9
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:17,400
You use your magnetic ring to control whether the number is odd or even.

10
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:20,760
But there were clearly seven seeds just now.

11
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,400
Why is there only one left?

12
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,430
If I hadn't swapped the seed under the cup,

13
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,590
how would you have fallen for the trick?

14
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,480
Impressive.

15
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:43,510
To swap objects in plain sight,

16
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,230
and with such speed,

17
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,680
you truly deserve the title "Golden Fingers," apprentice of the God of Gamblers.

18
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,840
I admit defeat.

19
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:00,310
What do you mean by that?

20
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,680
This $200,000 is what you just won.

21
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,590
I don't want the money.

22
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,190
I want Uncle Youqian to go back.

23
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,030
You foolish boy.

24
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,030
You saved him this time,

25
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,030
but he'll gamble again next time.

26
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,150
I advise you to take the money.

27
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,470
Don't waste your money on this hopeless gambler.

28
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,840
I don't want the money.

29
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,560
I want Uncle Youqian to go back.

30
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,520
I'll be honest with you.

31
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,280
The kidney already has a buyer.

32
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,360
So one of you must stay.

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,680
Kid,

34
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,190
I'll ask you one last time.

35
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,680
Are you going to take the money and leave,

36
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,590
or do you insist that I let him go?

37
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:03,590
What's wrong?

38
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,520
Why did you call me over in such a hurry?

39
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,360
What happened?

40
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,120
Don't cry, don't cry.

41
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,310
Mr. Peng Sai

42
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,360
You have to help me.

43
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,030
Brother Haoyun went to ransom my dad.

44
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,000
But the two of them

45
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,870
still haven't come back.

46
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,870
Can you send someone to rescue them?

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,470
Don't worry, stop crying, don't cry.

48
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:28,120
Your father definitely needs to be saved.

49
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,400
As for Haoyun,

50
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,080
it's not impossible.

51
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,870
Really?

52
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:36,710
Jinjin

53
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,310
Many years ago,

54
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,190
your father once promised me

55
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,080
that you would marry me. Look at us—

56
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:47,680
Mr. Peng Sai

57
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,520
We've always respected you.

58
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:51,800
But—

59
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:52,470
Jinjin

60
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,560
There's something you need to understand.

61
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,470
Do you want to live like this your whole life?

62
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,280
Always living in fear,

63
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,030
and ending up with hardly any money saved?

64
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,710
Be with me.

65
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,800
Stay with me.

66
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,150
I promise you'll never have to worry about food or clothing.

67
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:14,960
Okay?

68
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,070
Boss.

69
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:18,630
Boss, is that okay?

70
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:23,630
Think about it.

71
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,480
This...

72
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,560
Mr. Peng Sai.

73
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,430
You, you...

74
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,720
Are you really going to go?

75
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,950
It's just a few nobodies.

76
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,270
Just give them a little and they'll be satisfied.

77
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,360
In Laiwan, except for the Sun family,

78
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,830
everyone else still has to show me some respect.

79
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,310
But, but...

80
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,360
I heard the one behind this kidnapping is...

81
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,510
Who is it?

82
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,270
It's him.

83
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:54,950
What's wrong?

84
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,510
It's cash, after all.

85
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,120
It takes some time to prepare.

86
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,750
You can trust Mr. Peng Sai to handle things.

87
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,430
Have you made up your mind?

88
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,160
I'll give you one more chance.

89
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,000
Let Uncle Youqian go.

90
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,040
Okay.

91
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,390
Release Hao Youqian.

92
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,360
Give him the money from selling the kidney too.

93
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:25,800
Yes.

94
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,430
Then your kidney stays here.

95
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:34,920
No, that's not it.

96
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,270
You guys are really unprofessional.

97
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,360
Aren't you even going to use anesthesia?

98
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,390
Kid.

99
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,920
You're loyal, brave, and clever.

100
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,310
You really are qualified to marry into our family.

101
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,270
Marry in again?

102
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,480
Good luck. Are you okay?

103
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:32,920
Dad.

104
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,560
Can you stop meddling in my business?

105
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,920
You are my daughter.

106
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,720
Your marriage is a big deal.

107
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,480
As your father, how can I not care?

108
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,190
Young man,

109
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,560
I’ve taken a liking to you.

110
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,950
Be the son-in-law of our Naiwen family.

111
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:53,950
No, that’s not it.

112
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,510
What exactly are you all doing here?

113
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,240
That Hao Youqian

114
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,000
doesn’t treat you well.

115
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,600
Their family’s situation is also bad.

116
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,630
Today, our Naiwen family is asking you to be our son-in-law.

117
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,270
Why would you go back

118
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,000
to be their errand boy?

119
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,510
This two hundred thousand dollars

120
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,000
can be considered as buying out whatever kindness their family showed you.

121
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:20,040
Dad.

122
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:22,950
Uncle.

123
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,510
I’m sorry, but I can’t marry into your family as a son-in-law.

124
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,560
Kid, don’t push your luck.

125
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:34,390
Let me ask you one more time.

126
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,390
My daughter—

127
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,680
Will you marry her or not?

128
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:42,920
Uncle,

129
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,560
I’m someone who’s lost his memory.

130
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:47,920
How about we wait until I get my memory back?

131
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,480
Alright.

132
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,480
If he won't marry, then just kill him.

133
00:07:59,390 --> 00:07:59,950
Uncle.

134
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:00,870
Dad.

135
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,270
I dare anyone to touch my people.

136
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,630
Miss, don't be impulsive.

137
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:07,950
We're here to negotiate.

138
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,720
You come to my turf to threaten me?

139
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,630
Sun Yiqian, are you out of your mind?

140
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,120
We just got intimate yesterday.

141
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,600
So today I'm a bit desperate to save my husband.

142
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,430
President Nai Wen, please don't take offense.

143
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,160
Are you a kindergartener?

144
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,240
If you put it that way,

145
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,830
he touched me last night too.

146
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,510
So does that make us a couple too?

147
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:34,870
Miss.

148
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,510
Even if you really like that brat,

149
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,360
there's no need for us to go against the Nai Wen family.

150
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,790
They have a military background.

151
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,510
Does the Sun family need to be afraid of them?

152
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:47,840
Your Sun family

153
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,080
has already taken all our casino business.

154
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,510
Now you want to steal my son-in-law too.

155
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,320
President Nai Wen.

156
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,030
It's a misunderstanding, a misunderstanding.

157
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,510
It's just young people dating.

158
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,480
It's not as serious as you make it sound.

159
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:02,480
Alright.

160
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,600
How about we make a decision today?

161
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,480
Let's let Haoyun choose for himself.

162
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,360
See if he chooses my Nai Wen family

163
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,550
or your Sun family.

164
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:10,790
Fine.

165
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,000
Then the loser has to back out automatically.

166
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:14,910
Deal.

167
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:20,150
Get up.

168
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:25,870
Choose.

169
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:32,030
You must choose one of the two today.

170
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:40,790
Dad

171
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,630
Dad

172
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:43,910
Dad

173
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:45,550
Dad

174
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:46,440
Honey

175
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:47,510
Honey

176
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,510
Honey

177
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:50,360
Honey

178
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,320
Honey

179
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:03,960
Who... who are you?

180
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,120
What's going on right now?

181
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:11,360
This is my husband, You Haoyun.

182
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:15,480
We got separated last month because of a shipwreck.

183
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,320
Wait, I don't think I know you.

184
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,870
Honey, what's wrong?

185
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,360
Honey, don't scare me.

186
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,910
I'm your wife, Xia Zhi.

187
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,150
How could you forget me?

188
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,670
This is our daughter, Lele.

189
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,840
Right, the photo.

190
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:36,750
Look.

191
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,080
This is our photo.

192
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:46,360
We finally found you, honey.

193
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,600
Let's go home together, okay?

194
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,080
You really are my wife?

195
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,630
Lele

196
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,440
Let's take Dad home together.

197
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,000
Let's go.

198
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,480
Honey

199
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,080
Let's go.

200
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,080
Wait

201
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:02,510
Where are you going?

202
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,480
He hasn't chosen yet.

203
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,480
He already has a wife.

204
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,030
Stop embarrassing yourself here.

205
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,240
Miss, something's wrong.

206
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,240
There's trouble at the company.

207
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,510
We need to go back right away.

208
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,480
Thanks to the support of all the uncles.

209
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,790
I believe I will definitely lead the company

210
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,510
towards even greater prosperity.

211
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,150
Qianqian.

212
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,120
Why are you here?

213
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,200
I... I'm not really sure either.

214
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:40,390
I was just called here by Lawyer Jin as well.

215
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,120
At today's shareholders' meeting,

216
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,440
they suddenly initiated a vote.

217
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,030
It was decided on the spot that Mo Panbi

218
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,120
would be the acting chairman of Sun Group.

219
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,550
Isn't this a bit inappropriate?

220
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:56,630
Mo Panbi.

221
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,550
I really underestimated you.

222
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,870
I was only away from the company for a few days,

223
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,000
and you already took control of the entire board.

224
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,840
No, Qianqian,

225
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,790
you see, this was the board's decision after all.

226
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,440
I couldn't refuse it either.

227
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,750
I'm really sorry.

228
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,630
Young Master Mo, you don't need to blame yourself.

229
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,670
Actually, you can voluntarily give up

230
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,030
the right to be acting chairman.

231
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,360
If you want,

232
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,440
I can help you with the procedures right now.

233
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,360
No need for that.

234
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:26,750
Lawyer Jin, have a seat.

235
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:27,630
Sit.

236
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,320
Alright.

237
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,910
I think I should still follow

238
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,840
the decision of all the uncles.

239
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,200
What a pretender.

240
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,030
Qianqian.

241
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,320
I know you want to use

242
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,030
the charity poker tournament at the end of the month

243
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,750
to win the casino management rights

244
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,440
and thereby control the whole casino.

245
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,630
But I have some bad news

246
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:50,630
to tell you.

247
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,150
I've already sent someone

248
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:03,030
to track down the whereabouts of the gambling king, Mu Kun.

249
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,440
Even the God of Gamblers can't beat him.

250
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:07,390
Now,

251
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,390
you don't stand a chance.
