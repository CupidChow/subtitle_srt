1
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,430
Although I don't know why I'm here,

2
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,960
have we met before?

3
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,750
No, we haven't.

4
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,000
Alright.

5
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:03,920
Then tell me who you are.

6
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,680
You might not have heard of my name.

7
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,350
But my master is the God of Gamblers.

8
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,000
You definitely know him.

9
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,230
I don't believe you don't remember me.

10
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:16,230
We even pretended to be a married couple before.

11
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:18,040
You saved me more than once.

12
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,200
We even wore each other's clothes.

13
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:21,400
Do you really not remember any of this?

14
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,120
Miss,

15
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,000
although you look very beautiful,

16
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,350
your way of striking up a conversation is a bit outdated.

17
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,310
Miss!

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,790
Someone, come quickly!

19
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,510
These are your master's personal belongings.

20
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,840
There are also accounts opened in your name.

21
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,120
Good morning, Master.

22
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,350
Haoyun.

23
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,640
You have fully inherited my skills.

24
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,760
There is nothing more I can teach you.

25
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,310
Master, what are you doing?

26
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,230
I need to go out for a while.

27
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:10,630
The conflict between the old and new cheating techniques

28
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,750
has reached an irreconcilable point.

29
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,030
I must represent the traditional techniques

30
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,120
and defeat Mu Kun, who uses technology.

31
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,190
Master, let me go in your place.

32
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,680
I won't let you down.

33
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,000
Haoyun.

34
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,000
Listen to your master's advice.

35
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:27,150
Whether it's new or old cheating techniques,

36
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,310
they are all harmful and should not be used.

37
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,360
Never use them to gamble or deceive others.

38
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:33,470
Master.

39
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,080
Heaven is watching everything we do.

40
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,400
Karma always comes back around.

41
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:45,710
I've seen too many people at the gambling table in my life

42
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,150
lose everything and destroy their families.

43
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:48,870
Myself included.

44
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,960
As the saying goes, nine out of ten gamblers cheat.

45
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,150
I've made up my mind.

46
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,870
I will do everything I can to atone for my sins.

47
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,000
I will expose so-called gambling techniques to the world.

48
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,120
Their essence is just cheating.

49
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,360
Master.

50
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:06,360
Then what was the point of me learning all these skills?

51
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,190
If our unique skills are lost,

52
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,800
that will be my fault.

53
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,000
Come.

54
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:18,710
Remember this password.

55
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,150
Then go contact this person.

56
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,960
I opened an account in your name.

57
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,840
It's enough for you to live happily for the rest of your life.

58
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,750
Consider it some compensation from me to you.

59
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,190
But no matter what,

60
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,910
you can't use what I taught you

61
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,560
to make money for profit.

62
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,680
In Laiwan,

63
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,310
not many people know I have a disciple.

64
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,000
If something happens to your master,

65
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,030
you must continue to stay hidden.

66
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,560
Keep your identity secret.

67
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,470
Never reveal yourself.

68
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,430
Go live your own life well.

69
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,120
I didn't expect you to be Golden Finger.

70
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,560
Lawyer Jin.

71
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:05,870
Have we met before?

72
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:09,000
This is your master's will.

73
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,470
It's also proof

74
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,190
of your master-disciple relationship.

75
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:13,430
Sign it,

76
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,720
and you can inherit all your master's assets.

77
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,720
Lawyer Jin.

78
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,240
I want to reveal my identity.

79
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,000
But your master instructed

80
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,680
that you keep your identity hidden.

81
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,480
And live your life well.

82
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,190
I've made up my mind.

83
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:33,160
My master treated me with great kindness.

84
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,360
Now he died under unclear circumstances.

85
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,510
I absolutely can't tolerate this.

86
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,270
Young Master Mo

87
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,240
There's news from Lawyer Jin.

88
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
God of Gambling's apprentice, Golden Finger, has surfaced.

89
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,120
Who is it?

90
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:56,920
It's not confirmed yet.

91
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,950
Lawyer Jin said

92
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,160
he has to abide by professional ethics

93
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:01,870
and can't reveal it.

94
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,040
But given the past relationship between the God of Gambling and the Sun family,

95
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,040
Golden Finger will definitely go to the Sun family.

96
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,360
Young Master Mo,

97
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,120
if Golden Finger goes to help Sun Yiqian,

98
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,920
then in this charity poker tournament,

99
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,390
it'll be hard for us to gain the upper hand.

100
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:23,720
Besides,

101
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,750
because of what we've done before,

102
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,310
Sun Yiqian will definitely take revenge on us this time.

103
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,950
Look at you, acting so timid.

104
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,120
What are you afraid of?

105
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:34,000
Nothing.

106
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,950
The God of Gambling once worked with the Sun family.

107
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:44,040
But even if his apprentice goes to the Sun family,

108
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:47,120
he might not necessarily help Sun Yiqian gamble.

109
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:53,920
Now,

110
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,630
Sun Yiqian is seriously ill and bedridden.

111
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,800
She doesn't have the energy

112
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,830
to care about Golden Finger's return.

113
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,950
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for us.

114
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,190
Young Master Mo, you mean...

115
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,750
You should organize a welcome banquet.

116
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,000
Send an invitation to Golden Finger through Lawyer Jin.

117
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,510
Deliver an invitation letter.

118
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,430
We should try

119
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,720
to win over Golden Finger

120
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,680
and bring him to our side.

121
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:28,680
Understood.

122
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,480
I'll take care of this, don't worry.

123
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,040
It will definitely be done grandly.

124
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,190
Welcome! What would you like to eat?

125
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,270
Lucky Brother

126
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,310
I didn't get a chance to thank you that day.

127
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,070
Afterwards, I was too scared.

128
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:02,920
So,

129
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:04,750
I heard from others

130
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:07,310
that it was your family who saved me by the sea.

131
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,070
I have a check here.

132
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,680
It's to repay you for saving my life.

133
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:23,830
Who let you in?

134
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,070
It's okay.

135
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,240
Tonight, you can

136
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,000
come with me to the Golden Grand Hotel for a banquet.

137
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,720
If you have any requests, just let me know.

138
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,360
Wait a minute.

139
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,560
What banquet are you talking about?

140
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,240
The Golden Grand Hotel.

141
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,750
Is there a problem?

142
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,070
What a coincidence.

143
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:38,920
Tonight,

144
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:41,040
I also have a banquet at the Golden Grand Hotel.

145
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,800
And I'm the host.

146
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,000
Are you involved?

147
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,190
I haven't heard about it.

148
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,560
Who are you?

149
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:51,950
Who am I?

150
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,630
He asked who I am, Jin Jin.

151
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,480
No.

152
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,510
I'm your Brother Peng Sai, don't you recognize me?

153
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,720
Listen carefully.

154
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:03,160
Today, Young Master Mo Panbi assigned me

155
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,510
to organize this event.

156
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,480
It's a welcome banquet for Golden Finger.

157
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,190
All the dignitaries of Laiwan

158
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,480
will be present.

159
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,800
So, Jin Jin,

160
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,000
you must come tonight.

161
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,800
Because at the banquet,

162
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,600
I'll ask Golden Finger to be a witness

163
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,390
when I propose to you.

164
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,390
Listen up.

165
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:34,600
Stay away from Jin Jin.

166
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:35,440
Otherwise,

167
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:37,750
I'll beat you up every time I see you.

168
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,720
Since someone already sent an invitation,

169
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,440
that saves me the trouble.

170
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,440
I, You Haoyun, always repay kindness.

171
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,510
If you have any requests, just tell me.

172
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,360
Wait for me to pick you up.

173
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:14,840
Good luck.

174
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,240
Wait a second.

175
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,960
People always strive for a better life.

176
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:23,670
Isn't that right?

177
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,000
Peng Sai always promised to treat me well.

178
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,150
Mr. Li is really generous.

179
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,790
He actually gave a bracelet made of imperial jade.

180
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,320
Not just here in Laiwan,

181
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,670
even across the entire Southeast Asian market,

182
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,320
this is considered top quality.

183
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:30,080
Ever since the God of Gambling passed away,

184
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,870
his rumored apprentice, Golden Finger,

185
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,240
has probably become the top gambler in Laiwan.

186
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:36,750
Yes.

187
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:37,840
What I have to offer

188
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,630
might not even catch his eye.

189
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:42,600
Mr. Zhao,

190
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,150
what did you give?

191
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,360
I heard Golden Finger's sleight of hand is extraordinary.

192
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:50,510
Compared to his master, the God of Gambling,

193
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,960
he's just as good, if not better.

194
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,320
But every time he uses it,

195
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,960
it takes a lot of energy.

196
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:56,600
So,

197
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,960
I prepared a box

198
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:00,870
of thousand-year-old ginseng I've treasured for years.

199
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,080
Mr. Zhao,

200
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,910
you're really betting big this time.

201
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,720
Of course.

202
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,720
This thousand-year-old ginseng,

203
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,870
even when your father passed away,

204
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,480
you couldn't bear to take it out, right?

205
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,910
But today you're being so generous,

206
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,360
giving it to Golden Finger.

207
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:18,550
Yes, yes.

208
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:19,550
But speaking of which,

209
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,670
how did the God of Gambling die?

210
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,440
I heard that some time ago

211
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,870
the God of Gamblers and Mu Kun

212
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,670
agreed to have a showdown on a cruise ship.

213
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,630
In the end, he was outmatched.

214
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,120
He lost badly.

215
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,240
The God of Gamblers couldn't take it for a moment.

216
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,440
He got stuck in a dead end.

217
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,360
He blew up the ship and killed himself.

218
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,600
It was really tragic.

219
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,440
Is that true?

220
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:49,870
A casino was also blown up not long ago.

221
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,030
And also,

222
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,790
a very powerful boss died.

223
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,550
Could it be that he lost a bet and imitated the God of Gamblers

224
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,840
by blowing up the casino?

225
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:01,270
Let's go, let's go.

226
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,750
Come on, hurry up, let's go.

227
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:07,240
Mr. Chen.

228
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:07,840
Please go in.

229
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:08,840
Let's go.

230
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,720
Please show your invitation.

231
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,080
Why are you here?

232
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:21,790
You're getting engaged today.

233
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,960
How could I, as your father, not come?

234
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:25,960
You still have the nerve to see me?

235
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,790
Have you forgotten

236
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,600
that we severed our father-daughter relationship long ago?

237
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:32,390
My good daughter,

238
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,630
if it weren't for me,

239
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,390
how could you have gotten together with Mr. Peng Sai?

240
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,360
How could you be wearing such nice clothes?

241
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:38,510
I'm afraid

242
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:41,200
you'd still be with that worker, Hao Yun,

243
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,720
struggling to run a restaurant.

244
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:43,550
Shut up!

245
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,270
Sorry, sir.

246
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,030
I accidentally got your coat wet.

247
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:53,840
Why don't you take it off

248
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,910
and let me take care of it for you?

249
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,550
Okay.

250
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:01,440
Thank you.

251
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,600
So who exactly is this Golden Finger?

252
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,390
Why is everyone trying to please him?

253
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,870
Lucky Brother,

254
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:13,910
why are you here?

255
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,360
Are you pretending to be a waiter to ruin my Golden's plans?

256
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,550
I'm telling you, get out of here.

257
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,080
Everyone inside is someone you can't afford to mess with.

258
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:22,320
Sir,

259
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,270
I think you've got it backwards.

260
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:25,840
You—

261
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,720
Lucky Brother,

262
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,120
you'd better leave now.

263
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,080
Mr. Peng Sai will be here soon.

264
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,750
Today's event is special.

265
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,080
Don't cause any more trouble.

266
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,390
You lousy worker, you really showed up.

267
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,670
This banquet is for me.

268
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,510
If I'm not here,

269
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:44,670
where else would I be?

270
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,080
No,

271
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,080
you dressed yourself up as a waiter,

272
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:48,670
do you think that means you can

273
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,270
come and go in a place like this?

274
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:52,550
Security!

275
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:53,240
Here!

276
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:54,750
Come here.

277
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,670
Take this lousy worker

278
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:57,870
and drag him out for a beating.

279
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,720
I'd like to see who dares.

280
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,630
You— you—

281
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:03,630
Why are you barking like a dog?

282
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,200
Who do you think you are?

283
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,670
Let me introduce myself.

284
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,510
I'm Golden Finger.
