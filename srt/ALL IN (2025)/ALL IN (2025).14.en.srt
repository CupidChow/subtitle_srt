1
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,640
I've already sent someone

2
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,750
to find the whereabouts of the gambling king, Mu Kun.

3
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,880
Even the God of Gamblers can't beat him.

4
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:03,750
Now

5
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,840
you don't stand a chance anymore.

6
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,870
Your best decision now is

7
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:12,710
to marry me.

8
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,150
It's still too early to talk about winning or losing.

9
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,120
Even if you become the chairman,

10
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:25,790
you still can't be rude to me.

11
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:27,840
Because my surname is Sun.

12
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:30,640
This is the Sun Group.

13
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:46,200
Miss,

14
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,000
don't drink too quickly.

15
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,840
Mo Panbi is really something.

16
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:51,840
I really underestimated him before.

17
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,000
Uncle Pacha,

18
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:54,790
Yes.

19
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:56,870
Go help me investigate

20
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,000
a woman named Xia Zhi.

21
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,070
Who?

22
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,640
The woman who took away Good Luck today.

23
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:04,430
Miss,

24
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,430
there's something I'm not sure if I should say.

25
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,680
This is ruining someone else's family.

26
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,280
Don't get the wrong idea.

27
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,470
I have my own plan. Just go quickly.

28
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:22,360
Yes.

29
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,960
It really is Nai Wen.

30
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,870
Stop joking.

31
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,960
We can't handle this guy.

32
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,630
Let's talk about this later.

33
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:50,960
Hey, Jinjin.

34
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,000
I've already made the call.

35
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,960
I told them to release the person.

36
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm going to head out now.

37
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,840
Mr. Peng Sai, you can't leave.

38
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,280
You have to help me.

39
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,590
I'm already doing my best to help you, Jinjin.

40
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,800
What we need to do now

41
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,680
is to be a little more patient.

42
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,560
Let's wait a bit longer, okay?

43
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,190
Just wait a little longer, please.

44
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:07,870
I...

45
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,280
Is it fast or not? Is it fast or not?

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,910
I just sent someone to deliver the message.

47
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,710
Uncle came back by himself, didn't he?

48
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,750
What about Good Luck Brother? Where is he?

49
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,080
I didn't see him.

50
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,430
How is that possible?

51
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,750
He clearly...

52
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,630
Jinjin.

53
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,520
How could a mere worker save your father?

54
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,190
Doing something like saving someone in a crisis like this,

55
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,150
only you, President Peng Sai, could pull it off.

56
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,710
And let me tell you, Jinjin,

57
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,190
your biggest problem

58
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,470
is that you're too kind.

59
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:38,910
And you always think of others

60
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,590
as being as kind as you are.

61
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,400
That's not good.

62
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,630
President Peng Sai.

63
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,470
I'm truly grateful to you, President Peng Sai.

64
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,910
Thank you so much.

65
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,150
President Peng Sai happens to be here.

66
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,800
Please be my witness today.

67
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:53,870
Hao Youqian.

68
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,630
Today I had someone save your life.

69
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,000
Consider it repaying you for raising me.

70
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:00,680
From now on,

71
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,470
we owe each other nothing.

72
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,120
I, Hao Jinjin, no longer have you as my father.

73
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,560
What... what did you say?

74
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,630
I said we're severing our father-daughter relationship.

75
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,560
From now on, we'll have nothing to do with each other.

76
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:12,630
I... I...

77
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,150
Today, I...

78
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:14,630
I'll beat you to death!

79
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,360
Go ahead, hit me!

80
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:21,680
Fine.

81
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:22,950
Fine.

82
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,240
Fine.

83
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,630
I guess I deserve it.

84
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,630
Hey, who are you throwing things at?

85
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,360
Are you okay, Jinjin?

86
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,000
Don't be angry.

87
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,680
He's confused.

88
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,270
Wipe it off, wipe it off.

89
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:05,040
So you live here?

90
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,950
After the ship sank,

91
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,920
Lele and I fled to Laiwan.

92
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,630
We had no one to rely on.

93
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,190
Being able to find a place like this to stay

94
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:18,040
is already pretty good.

95
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,160
Besides being your man,

96
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,390
what else do I do?

97
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,480
I'm a crew member.

98
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,390
A crew member.

99
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:30,870
But why do I know so many gambling tricks?

100
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,070
Do I have any other friends?

101
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,560
Can you introduce me to them?

102
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,920
Dad, I'm hungry.

103
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,950
That's right, we haven't eaten yet.

104
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:44,160
Dad, we haven't eaten all day.

105
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,070
Should we eat first?

106
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,040
Honey.

107
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:57,830
Thank you.

108
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,510
Eat more vegetables.

109
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,680
I'm very sorry.

110
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,510
I really don't remember what happened before.

111
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,680
If you hadn't found me,

112
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,750
I don't know how much longer you would have gone hungry.

113
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,360
Honey, eat some vegetables.

114
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,310
Now that we can be together again,

115
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,510
I'm already very content.

116
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,270
Why did you seal the windows

117
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,600
so tightly?

118
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:34,680
Because we have to hide from the bad man.

119
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,600
The bad man?

120
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,750
Lele, don't talk nonsense.

121
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,630
That's how it is.

122
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:40,870
What about Laiwan?

123
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,000
Things have been unstable lately.

124
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,680
And the public security isn't good either.

125
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,240
You told me

126
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,680
to prepare more supplies.

127
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,800
Sorry for dragging you into this.

128
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,000
Honey.

129
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,800
Then let's buy boat tickets tomorrow

130
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,750
and leave Laiwan, okay?

131
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,240
Tomorrow?

132
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:02,270
Where are we going?

133
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,240
Home.

134
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,560
That way you might recover your memory sooner.

135
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,120
Let's get some rest.

136
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,310
How did we sleep before?

137
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,480
I mean sleeping, not that.

138
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,630
I sleep inside, you sleep outside.

139
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,680
Judging by his look,

140
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,190
he seems like an honest person.

141
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,830
He wouldn't lose control, would he?

142
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:35,390
But if I resist,

143
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,080
will he realize I'm lying to him?

144
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,790
What are you trying to do?

145
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,600
You two should sleep on the bed.

146
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,670
I'm more used to sleeping on the sofa.

147
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,550
Wait for me here for a while.

148
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,480
I'm going to meet someone.

149
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,360
The snakehead will be here soon.

150
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,270
Where are you going?

151
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,320
I'm afraid that after leaving Laiwan this time,

152
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,240
I don't know when I'll be able to come back.

153
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:35,480
I want to say goodbye.

154
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,320
Alright, go ahead.

155
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,840
We'll wait for you here.

156
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:41,080
Here.

157
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,150
I'll be right back.

158
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:00,150
Get in.

159
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:01,360
I'm not getting in.

160
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,600
What are you doing?

161
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,720
I know you're going to say goodbye to Hao Jinjin.

162
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,440
It'll be faster if I take you there.

163
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,720
Good luck.

164
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,030
I have something to tell you.

165
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,870
There's something wrong with that person named Xia Zhi.

166
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:26,910
I've already investigated

167
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,200
the crew list of that ship.

168
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,720
There's no one named Xia Zhi on it at all.

169
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:33,600
She might have made up everything she said yesterday.

170
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,320
Miss Sun,

171
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,200
stop showing off your tricks.

172
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,080
It's not hard for you to forge a list.

173
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,200
Ever since I met you,

174
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,480
I've always been used by you.

175
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,440
I can't tell anymore which of your words are true

176
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:49,790
and which are lies.

177
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,240
I'm just afraid you'll be fooled, you idiot.

178
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,240
Where have you been these past two days?

179
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:21,600
You said you were going to look for my dad.

180
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:22,670
Where have you been hiding?

181
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,960
Has Uncle Youqian come back?

182
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:29,440
Thanks to a few calls from Mr. Peng Sai,

183
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,270
they released my dad.

184
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,840
It's Mr. Peng Sai again.

185
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,390
Jin Jin,

186
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,480
I told you I risked my life to get Uncle Youqian back.

187
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,030
Do you believe me?

188
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,480
Good luck, brother.

189
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,480
How do you expect me to believe you?

190
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,120
Mr. Peng Sai made those calls right in front of me.

191
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,670
And you?

192
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,790
Where have you been these past two days?

193
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,080
It doesn't matter anymore.

194
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:57,150
I came today just to say goodbye.

195
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,360
I wish you a better life.

196
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,550
Hello, may I take your order?

197
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:29,200
Lele, wait here for mommy.

198
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:30,870
Mommy will go buy you something to eat.

199
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,630
You really made us search hard for you.

200
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:41,840
Please, I'm begging you, let me go.

201
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,510
I-I really didn't see anything at the time.

202
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,270
You didn't see anything?

203
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,790
Then why have you been hiding from us?

204
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:51,550
I'll leave Laiwan right away.

205
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,150
I promise I won't say a word.

206
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,080
Oh, really?

207
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,670
I only believe

208
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,000
that dead people can't talk.

209
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,600
Boss,

210
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,000
Or else,

211
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,240
let's talk somewhere else.
