1
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,240
I came here today

2
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:56,799
to give him a gift.

3
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:01,000
Wait, Miss Sun.

4
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:02,079
You might be mistaken.

5
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,200
I'm the owner of this shop.

6
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,519
He's just working for me.

7
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:08,120
Miss Sun is here.

8
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,280
Why haven't you taken these idle people away yet?

9
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:14,239
Did I tell you to touch him?

10
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:17,000
Let go.

11
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:30,400
I brought gifts today

12
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,120
specifically to give to him.

13
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,280
Uncle Pacha,

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,319
Sun Group presents a solid gold fortune toad,

15
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,079
an imperial green jade sailboat,

16
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,439
and a gemstone money tree.

17
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,079
Thank you.

18
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:55,599
I don't want any of these things.

19
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:56,640
Take them back.

20
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:57,719
What?

21
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,519
Are you out of your mind?

22
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,560
No.

23
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,840
These things are worth more than the shop.

24
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,000
How can you not want them?

25
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,960
You're Hao Jinjin's gambler father, aren't you?

26
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:12,719
Yes, yes.

27
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:14,800
I'm very sorry.

28
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:17,639
This is mine.

29
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:20,960
Yes, yes.

30
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:25,639
Congratulations.

31
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,120
I hope you can embrace a new life.

32
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,439
You and Good Luck should cut the ribbon together.

33
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,919
Then I

34
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,439
Th-this

35
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,360
Wishing you a prosperous opening

36
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,680
Good, good, good

37
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,560
May your business flourish, congratulations

38
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,360
Congratulations

39
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,599
Wishing you a prosperous opening

40
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:55,520
Wishing you a prosperous opening

41
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:56,759
May your business flourish

42
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:58,919
May your business boom

43
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,680
Miss Sun

44
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,400
Thank you for attending the ribbon-cutting at Jinjin Restaurant today.

45
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,840
And for helping me clarify the facts.

46
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,879
You don't need to thank me.

47
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,080
You know why I'm here.

48
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,080
To help me participate in the charity poker tournament.

49
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,039
So, what do you think?

50
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:21,199
Have you made up your mind?

51
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,879
When I helped you a few days ago,

52
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:26,599
I realized I'm really good at gambling.

53
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,800
It's like I was born to be a gambler.

54
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,039
Not only am I good at it,

55
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:32,960
I also really enjoy the process.

56
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:36,120
I'm afraid I'll become a compulsive gambler.

57
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:36,919
So,

58
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,879
I just want to live an ordinary life.

59
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:42,080
Please take these gifts back.

60
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:43,879
They're too valuable.

61
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:45,960
I really can't accept them.

62
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:47,400
Thank you.

63
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,080
You don't know what's good for you.

64
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,759
Congratulations.

65
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:55,240
Congratulations, congratulations.

66
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,400
Uncle Pacha, let's go.

67
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,479
Okay.

68
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,360
Let's go.

69
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,159
Wait, no.

70
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,639
My golden toad!

71
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,960
My jade sailboat!

72
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,000
My gemstone tree!

73
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,919
Good luck, brother.

74
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,120
I misunderstood you before.

75
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:14,520
I'm sorry.

76
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,240
My cards are too small, I fold.

77
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,439
Dad.

78
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:41,240
They found a survivor from the cruise ship explosion.

79
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:44,839
Then what are you waiting for?

80
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,839
Send someone to take care of it.

81
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:00,879
I won.

82
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,519
Good luck, brother. Your food is here.

83
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:08,160
It's right next door. Thanks for your hard work.

84
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,199
Uncle Kun has given a death order.

85
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,720
He must be eliminated tonight.

86
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,079
And he's right here.

87
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:20,959
In a moment,

88
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:22,800
everyone, keep a close watch.

89
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:24,399
Did you hear me?

90
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,279
Yes.

91
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,160
Let's go.

92
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,800
Deal the cards.

93
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:39,800
You guys are cheating.

94
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,240
Take me to see Mu Kun.

95
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:54,920
This is the place.

96
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:12,240
B-boss...

97
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,839
Look at me, I don't look like a rich guy.

98
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:16,439
There's no need to kill me for money, right?

99
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:22,600
How could I bear to let you die?

100
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,240
It's you.

101
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:33,319
Didn't Peng Sai help pay back the money?

102
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:34,759
Why are you still asking for money?

103
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:37,839
Peng Sai or not, it doesn't matter.

104
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,959
Do you think you can escape your debt?

105
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:43,040
That bastard Peng Sai

106
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,079
never tells the truth.

107
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,560
Give me one more day.

108
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,920
I'll find the money to pay you back.

109
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,920
So you don't have it now.

110
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,000
Hold him down.

111
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:54,279
What are you going to do?

112
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:59,160
Your eyeballs look pretty good.

113
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:01,839
I'll dig them out and use them as my glass eyes.

114
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:03,920
No, no!

115
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,839
Hey beautiful, who are you looking for?

116
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,160
I'm looking for him.

117
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,680
You're quite the lucky guy with the ladies.

118
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:31,279
Why are you always surrounded by beautiful women?

119
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,639
What are you doing here? It's too dangerous.

120
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,120
Of course, I came to make a bet with you.

121
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:40,000
If I win, I'll leave.

122
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:41,120
No.

123
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:42,480
Can't you see I'm busy?

124
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,959
You should hurry up and leave, miss.

125
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,000
Hurry up and go.

126
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:45,759
Alright, let's go, let's go.

127
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:46,439
Then I'll wait for you.

128
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:00,360
Hurry up!

129
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,160
Let's go.

130
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:05,120
She doesn't want to leave, so stop causing trouble.

131
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,519
Let go.

132
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:10,399
Calm down, calm down.

133
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:11,040
Calm down.

134
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,759
Babe, want a smoke first?

135
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:24,959
I don't really like men who smell like smoke.

136
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,480
What a coincidence.

137
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,000
I never smoke either.

138
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,159
Hey beautiful,

139
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:33,879
Being with this loser

140
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,279
isn't as good as being with me.

141
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,559
As long as you become my woman,

142
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,720
I promise you'll live the good life.

143
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:52,759
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts!

144
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:54,320
It hurts!

145
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:55,720
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts!

146
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:57,840
Don't come over here! Stay back!

147
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,200
You bunch of useless trash.

148
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:00,639
Even all together,

149
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:03,039
you might not even be worth as much as one of his hands.

150
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,080
Boss!

151
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:09,559
You filthy woman, how dare you lay a hand on me!

152
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,840
Now we're in big trouble.

153
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:18,519
I'll hold them off. You go, quickly!

154
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:20,799
Someone, strip this filthy woman!

155
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,480
Get him!

156
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,720
When I'm done with her,

157
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:23,480
you guys can do whatever you want.

158
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:25,600
Hurry, get out of here!

159
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,440
Screw you!
