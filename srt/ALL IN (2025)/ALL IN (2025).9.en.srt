1
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,439
Lucky Brother, I'm here!

2
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,240
Lucky Brother, I'm here!

3
00:00:58,479 --> 00:00:59,280
Jinjin, be careful.

4
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:03,840
Be careful.

5
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,040
Why aren't you wearing any clothes?

6
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:13,840
I... I...

7
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,480
I just used the bathroom, so I smell a bit.

8
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:16,239
I took a shower.

9
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,439
Wait for me, I'll be ready soon.

10
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:18,680
Almost ready, almost ready.

11
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,159
Just a moment.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,560
Almost done.

13
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:23,920
Almost done, almost done.

14
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,439
Sun Yiqian, what do you really mean?

15
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,280
Then what do you mean?

16
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,040
I think you don't just want his help.

17
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,599
To win the charity poker tournament.

18
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:45,040
You want to have him for yourself.

19
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:48,439
Him?

20
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,079
He's just a gambler.

21
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,959
You know I hate people like that the most.

22
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:56,000
But...

23
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,079
Birds of a feather flock together.

24
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,799
He probably suits your taste quite well.

25
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,599
You wouldn't just

26
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:04,879
want him to gamble with you, would you?

27
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,680
Since you already know,

28
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:08,439
then there's no need to waste any more effort.

29
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,080
He's mine.

30
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,000
Thank you.

31
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,400
I was worried he'd cling to me.

32
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,560
Hello, Mr. Mo.

33
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,319
Young Master Mo.

34
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,479
Old K from the Sun family sent a message.

35
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,080
He said...

36
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,439
He said the eldest Miss of the Sun family

37
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:06,439
will have lunch at a fast food restaurant tomorrow.

38
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,080
No need to report such trivial matters.

39
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,280
Yes.

40
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,840
Should we let him take action?

41
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:17,879
No need.

42
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:21,400
Just have him arrange a meeting with the board members for me.

43
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:29,479
Old K is a big player.

44
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,560
Unless it's a critical moment,

45
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:39,520
he absolutely can't be exposed.

46
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:43,800
Understood.

47
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,919
Good luck, brother.

48
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,199
Sorry.

49
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:09,680
About last night in the restroom—

50
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:11,360
I really didn't mean it.

51
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:13,840
Let me help you apply the medicated oil.

52
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:15,960
It's fine, it's fine.

53
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:16,879
No need.

54
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,240
I can do it myself.

55
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:20,839
I—

56
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,560
Jinjin, Jinjin.

57
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,240
Jinjin.

58
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,120
I'm here.

59
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:34,319
I wanted to talk to you about the shop incident last time.

60
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,720
Sorry, it was a misunderstanding.

61
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,959
It's all in the past now.

62
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:39,759
President Peng, there's no need to bring it up again.

63
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:43,079
Actually, I came today for another matter.

64
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:46,759
I just found out about it too.

65
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:49,040
A very, very powerful boss

66
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,959
is coming to Laiwan to invest in chain stores.

67
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,639
I think

68
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,639
I think it's perfect for you.

69
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:56,959
Chain stores?

70
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:57,600
Yeah.

71
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:05,199
But my shop has only just opened.

72
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,879
I'm worried I won't be able to handle it all.

73
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:10,319
People strive to move up, just as water flows downward.

74
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:13,079
Once you really join the franchise,

75
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,319
and become a big boss,

76
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,720
enjoying the cash flow,

77
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,759
then you'll understand

78
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,240
what it's like to count money until your hands cramp.

79
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:23,040
Really.

80
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,920
Of course it's true.

81
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:27,720
You don't need to worry about the capital operations.

82
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:28,600
I'll handle it.

83
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,079
When the day comes

84
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:31,639
that you're counting money until your hands cramp,

85
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,120
you'll have me to thank.

86
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:36,839
Here, take this.

87
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:42,639
Everyone will be at the club tonight, here's the address.

88
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:43,560
You must come.

89
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:45,360
We'll talk about joining the franchise.

90
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,879
Jinjin, don't believe him.

91
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,560
He's just a liar.

92
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,680
Last time, he said he paid back the thirty million Uncle Youqian owed.

93
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:55,879
But he never actually paid it back.

94
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:56,959
I...

95
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:57,959
I ac—

96
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:00,480
Don't come looking for Jinjin again.

97
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:03,000
Or I'll beat you up every time I see you.

98
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,800
W-wait, Brother Haoyun.

99
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,759
The debt collectors really haven't come after us anymore.

100
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:10,879
You...

101
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:14,040
I can't believe you're taking his side.

102
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:16,600
I'm begging you,

103
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:18,839
please don't ruin Jinjin's bright future anymore.

104
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,680
You say I didn't pay back the money,

105
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:22,160
but has anyone come to collect it?

106
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,519
That's because someone paid it for us.

107
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,639
Someone else paid it off.

108
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:28,439
Don't tell me you're going to use Miss Sun as an excuse again.

109
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,560
As your shield.

110
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,639
I didn't pay that money.

111
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,439
Are you saying you paid it?

112
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,360
That thirty million has nothing to do with Miss Sun.

113
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,920
I'm not even that close with Miss Sun.

114
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:36,519
Yeah, right.

115
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:37,319
The thirty million was because...

116
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:37,720
Haoyun.

117
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,120
Yes.

118
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,160
It's been days since we met. Did you miss me?

119
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:45,720
Oh, right.

120
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:47,199
I even brought you a gift.

121
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,759
Jinjin, you're here too.

122
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,319
Whoa, why is she here?

123
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,160
President Peng Sai.

124
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,720
Let's go meet the investors.

125
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,399
Okay.

126
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:04,000
Jinjin, don't go with him.

127
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,240
He's definitely lying to you.

128
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,720
My business is none of your concern.

129
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,800
Sorry, Miss Sun.

130
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,680
I have something to do, so I'll leave first.

131
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,519
Let Haoyun take care of you.

132
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:17,399
Goodbye, Miss Sun.

133
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,120
Jinjin.

134
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:21,680
Miss Sun, I have something to do.

135
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,879
If there's anything, let's talk tomorrow.

136
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,879
Haoyun, wait a moment.

137
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:30,040
Haoyun.

138
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:32,199
Today you chased after Jinjin and convinced her to come back.

139
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:34,680
But what about tomorrow? Or the day after?

140
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,600
She has an ambitious heart.

141
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:41,360
You can't protect her forever.

142
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:43,360
But as long as you help our young lady

143
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,319
win the competition,

144
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:45,720
you become her ambition.

145
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,560
Then Jinjin will never have to

146
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,399
deal with people like Peng Sai again.

147
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:53,920
Uncle Pacha.

148
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:56,040
Let him go.

149
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,399
Yes.

150
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:17,560
Why haven't I seen anyone else?

151
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:19,360
It's still early.

152
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,759
And big bosses,

153
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:23,040
they all like to be late.

154
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,319
Jinjin,

155
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:30,600
do you know why I care so much

156
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:32,039
about your affairs?

157
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:37,399
Because long ago,

158
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,679
I already saw you as my future wife.

159
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,879
Mr. Peng Sai, you really like to joke.

160
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,799
I'm sincere about you, Jinjin.

161
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:49,240
I've done so much for you.

162
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,600
My feelings for you—

163
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:52,600
don't you understand them at all?

164
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,480
No.

165
00:08:58,519 --> 00:08:59,320
Mr. Peng Sai.

166
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:03,039
It's fine, it's fine.

167
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:06,440
I'll go get a bottle of wine.

168
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,279
Relax a bit.

169
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,240
Sorry about that.

170
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:30,480
Peng Sai.

171
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:31,919
Wait a moment.

172
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,159
Put this in the wine.

173
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,600
Bring it to my room.

174
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,240
I'm telling you,

175
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,159
no matter what sounds you hear later,

176
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,200
don't come in and disturb me.
