1
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:54,280
Young Master Mo, it's him.

2
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,960
He was the one who ruined our plan last time.

3
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:02,960
Pardon my intrusion, Young Master Mo.

4
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,510
As the saying goes, a fight brings people together.

5
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,710
If it weren't for the misunderstanding last time,

6
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:10,870
I wouldn't have known

7
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,430
that we actually share a common enemy.

8
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,680
A common enemy?

9
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,200
You mean Golden Finger?

10
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,640
I'll get straight to the point.

11
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,870
I came here today

12
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,400
to join you, Young Master Mo.

13
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,120
I know that you

14
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,590
are preparing to enter the charity poker tournament.

15
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,150
You also want to take over the management rights of the Sun family's casino.

16
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,280
If you help me get a spot in the tournament,

17
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,230
I, Mu Kun,

18
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,120
can win the competition.

19
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,230
Rumor has it you once beat the God of Gamblers.

20
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,070
But I've never seen your skills myself.

21
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,000
Why should I trust you?

22
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,790
Do you have any other choice?

23
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,120
If I could make the God of Gamblers lose once,

24
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,840
all the way until the explosion,

25
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,080
he never won back, even when he died in the blast.

26
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,840
Let alone just a disciple.

27
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,870
He hasn't seen much of the world.

28
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,000
Young Master Mo,

29
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,310
only I know Golden Finger's weakness.

30
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,800
Help me get into the tournament,

31
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,150
and I'll help you take down Golden Finger.

32
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:41,310
Let me introduce myself.

33
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,840
The head of the Naiwen family

34
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,120
has already been taken care of by me.

35
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,710
All their family’s businesses

36
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,430
now belong to me.

37
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,120
If I help Young Master Mo win the competition

38
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,840
and secure the casino management rights from the Sun Group,

39
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,560
then in the whole of Laiwan,

40
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,000
the gambling industry

41
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,630
will be controlled by just the two of us.

42
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:12,800
Alright.

43
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,800
The money and people you lost

44
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,030
I can make up for all of them.

45
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,560
As long as you help me defeat Golden Finger,

46
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,310
whatever you want,

47
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,680
I can give it to you.

48
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,840
I knew I wasn’t wrong about you.

49
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:52,560
Goodbye.

50
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:01,520
Young Master Mo Panbi

51
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,120
Do you really trust him?

52
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,280
Is it really that important whether I trust him or not?

53
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,800
It's just spending a bit of money.

54
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,680
Just buying some insurance, that's all.

55
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:15,960
Xiao Pengsai

56
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:19,430
You have a lot of questions today.

57
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,000
Did that Golden Finger scare you out of your wits?

58
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,920
Are you planning to go complain to him later?

59
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,680
Young Master Mo Panbi, you're overthinking it.

60
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,310
It's definitely not like that, I swear.

61
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,560
Come, come, come.

62
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,310
Of course I trust you.

63
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:37,920
How about this—

64
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,600
You leave Laiwan immediately.

65
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,160
So that Golden Finger

66
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:45,870
won't find out you're pretending to obey me while actually defying me.

67
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,830
And then throw you into the sea to feed the fish.

68
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,040
That wouldn't be good, would it?

69
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,630
I'll do as you say, Young Master.

70
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,040
I'll go back and pack my things today.

71
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,360
I'll leave here first thing tomorrow morning.

72
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,310
The longer the night, the more likely something will go wrong.

73
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,480
You leave right now.

74
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,680
Right now.

75
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,390
Don't worry.

76
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:06,870
My people will escort you out safely.

77
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:08,510
Wait—

78
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,390
Young Master Mo, what are you—

79
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,310
Where are you sending me, Young Master?

80
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,950
Young Master, you can't just burn bridges after crossing them.

81
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:14,680
Right?

82
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,070
Have Old K bring the key.

83
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:28,750
Come in.

84
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:32,630
Miss.

85
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,190
Uncle Pacha, please have a seat first.

86
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,000
I have something to discuss with you.

87
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,120
I can't just sit and wait for death anymore.

88
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,720
Mo Panbi has already targeted me twice.

89
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:46,950
But

90
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,750
before I find evidence of him transferring assets,

91
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,000
acting rashly will only cause greater losses.

92
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,870
That means we shouldn't rush things even more.

93
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,510
Didn't you hear what the doctor said?

94
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,000
Your health isn't very good to begin with.

95
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,600
And lately, your condition has been unstable.

96
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,000
So you really need to rest well.

97
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,000
I've already found

98
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,920
the person who killed my parents back then.

99
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:08,390
What?

100
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,120
Yes.

101
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,270
That person is

102
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,120
Mu Kun.

103
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,070
Mu Kun.

104
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,120
Good luck.

105
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,480
You came to see me

106
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,720
because you remembered who I am?

107
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,190
Miss Sun.

108
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,870
I'm here today to propose a collaboration.

109
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:52,750
I've received news

110
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,510
that Mu Kun and Mo Panbi have joined forces

111
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,390
and decided to participate in the charity poker tournament

112
00:06:59,120 --> 00:06:59,680
in order to

113
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,920
gain control of the entire Sun Group.

114
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:05,510
Mu Kun is the real mastermind behind my master's murder.

115
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,000
Now we both have a common enemy.

116
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:09,950
So

117
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,430
working together is our best option.

118
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,360
How do you want to work together?

119
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,630
Transfer some shares of Sun Group to me.

120
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,630
That way, I'll be qualified to join the game.

121
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,630
I want to defeat him at the charity poker tournament.

122
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,600
I want to ruin his reputation.

123
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,750
So you were after

124
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,630
the casino owned by Sun Group.

125
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,680
The price is negotiable.

126
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,360
You can leave.

127
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,040
I will not transfer my shares to you.

128
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:45,310
I have evidence in my hands right now.

129
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,720
It can prove

130
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:49,310
that you have been illegally transferring assets within the group.

131
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,310
Miss Sun,

132
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:53,560
you forced me into this.

133
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:57,630
Now I want all of your shares.

134
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,120
What?

135
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,870
If you don't transfer your shares to me,

136
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,480
be prepared for them to be frozen

137
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:10,600
and for you to be kicked out.

138
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,190
Hello, Lawyer Jin.

139
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,920
You have served Sun Group for three generations.

140
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,800
You are known for your integrity.

141
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:35,150
Now I want you to help me investigate

142
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,120
whether there is

143
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,750
any illegal transfer of funds within the group.

144
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:39,670
Yes.

145
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:42,720
If necessary,

146
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,630
you can urgently transfer my shares

147
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:45,960
to avoid risk.

148
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,200
Okay.

149
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,080
I'll authorize you soon.

150
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,000
All the surveillance footage has been deleted.

151
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,870
Check the computer in the president's office

152
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,000
to see if there are any traces left.

153
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,200
How could he unlock my computer?

154
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,720
Where did he get my fingerprint?

155
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,910
Oh, my Qianqian.

156
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,630
I used your computer and your access rights

157
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,320
to sell off the company's assets.

158
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:46,030
If this ever gets discovered,

159
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,030
you'll be the one to take all the blame.

160
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,910
Let's see how you'll beg me then.

161
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,200
Hello, Uncle Pacha.

162
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:20,320
Call all the board members to the company immediately.

163
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,030
I've got evidence of Mo Panbi

164
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,630
illegally transferring assets.

165
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,870
We have to stop him right away.

166
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:35,720
Miss.

167
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,480
Where are the other board members?

168
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:50,440
My Qianqian.

169
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,150
Are you waiting for someone?

170
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:55,840
Don't wait anymore.

171
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:58,030
They're not coming.

172
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,320
Mo Panbi.

173
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,630
What on earth is going on?

174
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,320
Why don't you explain it clearly?

175
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,790
Old K.

176
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,120
I'm sorry, Miss.

177
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,270
Uncle Pacha.

178
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:23,320
You were bribed by Mo Panbi too?

179
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,270
Now you finally understand

180
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:29,120
why every move you made

181
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,320
I was always one step ahead of you.

182
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:34,080
You—

183
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:34,630
Come back!

184
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,870
Mo Panbi

185
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,870
You despicable scoundrel.

186
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:45,790
By doing this,

187
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,080
have you ever considered the other board members?

188
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,510
Why should I care about them?

189
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,360
I've been handling things all these years,

190
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,270
but the money

191
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:57,790
has to be split with those old geezers.

192
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:02,360
Why do you stubbornly refuse to change?

193
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,320
Why do you insist on making money you shouldn't?

194
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:06,840
Money I shouldn't make?

195
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,390
And what money shouldn't I make?

196
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,000
Is it just because my last name isn't Sun?

197
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,390
Because I'm not a Sun,

198
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,870
I deserve to be trampled under your feet?

199
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,240
Trying to send out the evidence, huh?

200
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,870
Old K, take care of it.

201
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,270
Hand it over, Miss.

202
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:03,390
Since everything's out in the open,

203
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,440
just sign it.

204
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,720
Give up the group's casino management rights.

205
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,840
So I don't have to jump through more hoops

206
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,550
to fight you at the gambling table.

207
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:15,910
Pah!

208
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:18,720
Shameless!

209
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,030
You're right about that.

210
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:26,670
Old K.

211
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:30,750
We'll leave the Sun family's young lady to you.

212
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,750
In Laiwan,

213
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,390
I don't want to see her again.

214
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,480
Thanks for your hard work, brother.

215
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,510
Take a break.

216
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:10,720
Come.

217
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:12,750
Come on, brother, get up here.

218
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:14,390
Come.

219
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,120
Just do as I say.

220
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:47,870
Don't move.

221
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,200
I'll let you go without any trouble.
