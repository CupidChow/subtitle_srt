1
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,000
Open, open, open

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,760
Big, big, big

3
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:19,800
Big, big, big

4
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,480
Again, reveal the cards

5
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:54,159
Royal flush

6
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,079
Hello, Miss.

7
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,760
Dad, Mom.

8
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:47,439
I'm back in Laiwan.

9
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,359
I will take back everything that belongs to the Sun family.

10
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:52,480
I'll get it all back.

11
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:54,480
This is my promise to you.

12
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,280
Miss.

13
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:57,879
There's a conclusion now.

14
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,840
According to the police investigation,

15
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:03,000
the God of Gambling and Mu Kun were gambling on a cruise ship.

16
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,519
In the end, the God of Gambling lost.

17
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:08,120
For some unknown reason, the cruise ship suddenly exploded.

18
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:09,439
Mu Kun was rescued.

19
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,599
But his whereabouts are still unknown.

20
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,199
Miss.

21
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,120
Please listen to my advice.

22
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:16,800
You shouldn't get involved in the group's

23
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,000
charity poker tournament anymore.

24
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:18,599
No.

25
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:21,680
The charity poker tournament

26
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:24,039
is my only chance to regain the Sun family's casino management rights.

27
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:24,840
It's the only opportunity.

28
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,719
But without the God of Gambling's help,

29
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:27,960
how can you win the tournament?

30
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,400
How can you beat Mo Panbi?

31
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,080
Since it's rumored that Mu Kun can beat the God of Gambling, Chawa,

32
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,199
then isn't Mu Kun our new candidate?

33
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,159
Come on, come on.

34
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:49,199
Come on, come on.

35
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,479
Come on, come on, keep going, keep going.

36
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,080
Keep going, keep going.

37
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,240
Deal from the bottom, he's cheating.

38
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:59,319
Uncle Youqian, stop gambling.

39
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:01,080
What if you lose the money Jinjin gave us to buy fish again,

40
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:01,919
and lose it all?

41
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,639
Then the restaurant won't be able to operate.

42
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:06,000
You really don't know how to be grateful at all.

43
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,439
If my family didn't live by the sea,

44
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:08,759
and take you in after finding you,

45
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,080
you would have starved to death in Laiwan long ago.

46
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,000
Come on, come on.

47
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:15,199
I'm warning you.

48
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,360
Don't touch my lucky charm setup.

49
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:17,800
If you talk back again,

50
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:19,080
I'll kick you out.

51
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,639
And then I'll report you for illegal entry.

52
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,680
They'll lock you up in jail.

53
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,280
Looks like I've got good luck today.

54
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,520
Finally took the bait.

55
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:42,400
Straight wins all.

56
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,319
Miss.

57
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,879
This is a lawless place.

58
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,039
What are you doing here at the Pangzhan fish farm?

59
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:57,240
I'm looking for someone.

60
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:58,560
Looking for someone?

61
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:01,520
Give me your cigarette.

62
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:13,599
Come on, hurry up, hurry up.

63
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,839
I heard the gambling king Mu Kun

64
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,079
is the boss around here.

65
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:33,839
Do me a favor and take me to see him.

66
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:36,040
If you're not gambling, get out of the way.

67
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,439
Where did this annoying woman come from? Who do you think you are?

68
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,639
What are you nosing around for?

69
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,720
How dare you insult me!

70
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,720
My Pixiu, miss.

71
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,360
Miss.

72
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,079
Sorry, my friend.

73
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:48,480
It's fine.

74
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,600
It's a misunderstanding.

75
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,120
It's okay.

76
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:50,800
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

77
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:51,480
How is it okay?

78
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:52,959
You almost ruined my fortune array!

79
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,120
Uncle, your Pixiu didn't fall over.

80
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:55,839
No.

81
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:57,680
No, which side are you on?

82
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:58,959
Go on.

83
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:02,879
Take me to see Mu Kun.

84
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:04,279
This stack of money is yours.

85
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:05,759
This, this...

86
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,120
Why are you looking for my boss?

87
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,680
Do I still need to explain?

88
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:12,720
No.

89
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,439
Then to see my boss,

90
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,240
you still need to make an appointment.

91
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:18,399
No, no, this—

92
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:21,399
I'll take you there right now.

93
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:23,120
No, that's not possible.

94
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,160
The cards are already halfway dealt.

95
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:26,279
We have to finish this round.

96
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,439
Alright.

97
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,240
If you want to give me money,

98
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:32,560
why would I stop you?

99
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,839
Fine, let's finish this round.

100
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,319
Uncle, stop gambling.

101
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:38,959
You're definitely going to lose this round, let's go.

102
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:41,399
So you can see what's going on too.

103
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:42,800
No.

104
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:45,920
I just noticed the dealer here is really bad at dealing.

105
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:46,920
He can't deal good cards.

106
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:48,959
Uncle, let's go quickly.

107
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:49,920
Nonsense!

108
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:51,319
I'm on a winning streak right now.

109
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:52,519
Don't jinx it here.

110
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:54,160
Wait a second.

111
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,480
What nonsense are you talking about?

112
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:56,759
Why don't you do it, then?

113
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,519
You—

114
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,360
Miss.

115
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:00,800
We'd better not meddle in other people's business.

116
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:02,360
Let him learn his lesson.

117
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,160
Since you don't want us to leave,

118
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,199
then I'll make you return the money you just cheated out of people.

119
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:07,879
Give it all back.

120
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:09,680
Deal the cards.

121
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:21,360
Alright.

122
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:36,600
Three of a kind

123
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,360
Call

124
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:37,920
Fold

125
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:40,079
No

126
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,720
I have a straight

127
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,040
Straight

128
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,360
I have three of a kind

129
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,839
I won

130
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,720
Such good luck

131
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:57,920
How is this possible?

132
00:06:58,439 --> 00:06:58,959
They're all mine

133
00:06:58,959 --> 00:06:59,959
Such quick hands

134
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:03,560
He can actually pick out an Ace from the deck so fast

135
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,439
No, you have to accept the loss if you gamble

136
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,839
No, what are you doing?

137
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,879
Accept your loss if you gamble

138
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,839
Put the money down

139
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:16,160
How can you cheat?

140
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,120
What are you doing?

141
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,199
Screw you

142
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:20,879
Accept your loss if you gamble

143
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:22,079
Why are you hurting people now?

144
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:23,199
You

145
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,680
Give me the money, hurry up

146
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:27,920
Stop right there

147
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,040
Are you guys okay?

148
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:32,000
Thank you

149
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,240
We have no luck, let's go

150
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,199
Let's go

151
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:39,759
Miss, this guy's got some skills

152
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:44,480
God of Wealth, bless us

153
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:46,560
May we have mountains of gold and silver

154
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:56,040
When I first picked you up

155
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,399
The ticket said "Good Luck" on it

156
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:58,920
So I just wanted some good fortune

157
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,120
I named you "Good Luck"

158
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,439
But how come you don't have any luck at all?

159
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,319
You

160
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,519
You loser

161
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,079
Let's just call you "bad luck."

162
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,800
Where's the fish you were supposed to buy?

163
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,160
Dad, you lost all the money again.

164
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:23,000
I didn't lose. I won today.

165
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,759
Then where's the fish?

166
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:25,480
Who knew that guy would cheat—

167
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,639
He ran off with the money.

168
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:30,120
Dad.

169
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,399
Can you please stop gambling?

170
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:33,279
I...

171
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,759
You can't blame me for that.

172
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:36,080
It was good luck that led me there.

173
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,000
This was his hand.

174
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:43,159
Uncle, uncle!

175
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,240
No, Jinjin—

176
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:45,919
I didn't.

177
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,080
Do you think I'm blind?

178
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,200
If you keep gambling like this,

179
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,399
this family will fall apart.

180
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:52,759
You...

181
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,879
We can't go on like this.

182
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:54,720
You...

183
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:06,159
Qianqian.

184
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,240
Mo Panbi.

185
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,279
If there's nothing else,

186
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:19,759
please go back.

187
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:22,159
There is something.

188
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:23,799
Take this.

189
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:25,759
Of course there's something.

190
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,240
And it's a good thing.

191
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:30,840
When we were little,

192
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,480
our families arranged our marriage.

193
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,399
I'm here today to fulfill that engagement.

194
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:37,919
I'm here to marry you.

195
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:42,120
You really know how to joke.

196
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:43,639
I've never heard about this.

197
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,159
Attorney Jin.

198
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:51,840
Attorney Jin.

199
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,360
What he said is true.

200
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:58,519
As a veteran of the Sun Group for over thirty years,

201
00:09:58,919 --> 00:09:59,759
I can vouch for it.

202
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,840
This engagement is real.

203
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,279
But as the most renowned lawyer in Laiwan,

204
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,639
I can tell you with full responsibility

205
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,399
that this so-called engagement

206
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:13,200
actually has no legal effect.

207
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,360
What do you mean, no legal effect?

208
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,159
Come on, come on.

209
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,039
This is an engagement between two families.

210
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:27,519
If your Sun family doesn't honor the engagement,

211
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:31,120
aren't you afraid the uncles on the board

212
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,840
will lose faith in your family?

213
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,279
Mo Panbi.

214
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,159
Don't think I don't know what you're up to.

215
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:39,879
You're just afraid that at next month's

216
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:41,240
charity poker tournament,

217
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,000
you won't get the casino's management rights.

218
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,799
So now you want to use the engagement

219
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:47,080
to split my shares.

220
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,120
No.

221
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,639
Keep dreaming.

222
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,960
So what if I am?

223
00:10:58,799 --> 00:10:59,679
Or do you

224
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,000
want to go against the entire board?

225
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,960
That's really a shame.

226
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:10,679
I'm already engaged to someone else.

227
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:19,200
In Laiwan,

228
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,799
other than me, Mo Panbi,

229
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,679
who else is worthy of the Sun family's eldest daughter?

230
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,519
Why not?

231
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,360
My fiancé is

232
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,480
is...

233
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:36,279
it's...

234
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:43,799
It's him!

235
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,519
My fiancé is him.
