1
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:45,962
MISS NIGHT AND DAY

2
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:53,762
Come on!

3
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:56,014
Why aren't you drinking?

4
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:58,641
To be honest, I don't feel well.

5
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:01,144
I don't feel well either!

6
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:02,228
Just one sip.

7
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:07,734
Okay? Let's cheers.

8
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:09,903
-All right?
-Excuse me. Who are you?

9
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:11,029
Just a second.

10
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:12,363
Who are you?

11
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:13,281
I'm Lee Mi-jin.

12
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:14,324
Are you kidding me?

13
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:19,913
Don't drink it.

14
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:23,958
Hurry and take a sip. Cheers.

15
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:25,210
Okay.

16
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:30,799
Hurry and drink it.

17
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,759
Cheers! Okay?

18
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,177
Cheers!

19
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,845
She did this, and if you drink it…

20
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,597
You'll become like this.

21
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,225
Does your neck hurt?

22
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:42,185
-No, I'm fine.
-Cheers.

23
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:45,605
Just one sip.

24
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:49,859
She did this.

25
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,861
Dizzy. No, don't.

26
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,614
-What do you keep looking at?
-No, wait… Cheers.

27
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:59,661
It's bottoms up. You have to finish it.

28
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:01,121
Okay.

29
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:09,629
No!

30
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:21,099
Hey. Excuse me.

31
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,612
Babe!

32
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:37,240
-"Babe"?
-"Babe"?

33
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:40,034
Are you cheating on me again?

34
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:41,077
He must've cheated.

35
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,746
He is pretty handsome though.

36
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,085
Who's this woman?

37
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,128
Who are you?

38
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:51,713
Who is she?

39
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:56,926
-I can explain--
-Is she your girlfriend?

40
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,012
No, she's--

41
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:00,722
Yeah, I'm his girlfriend! So?

42
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:04,976
It doesn't matter if he's taken.

43
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:09,230
Who will it be? Choose.

44
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,107
-Excuse me?
-Will it be that bitch or me?

45
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,483
"Bitch"?

46
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:13,818
No, wait…

47
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,987
He's my boyfriend! Back off!

48
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,864
What's wrong with you?

49
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:20,283
Wow, you're strong as hell! He's mine!

50
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:21,743
Starting today, he's mine!

51
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:23,411
He's my boyfriend, damn it!

52
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:25,330
Starting today, he's mine!

53
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:27,290
Jeez, she's too strong.

54
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:28,207
Hold on.

55
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,208
Why are you so strong?

56
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,753
-Stop! That's enough!
-Okay!

57
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:36,633
Let's not do this and take it outside.
I mean, let's talk outside.

58
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:38,551
Goodness!

59
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,011
-Poppy!
-Who is it?

60
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:41,971
-Who is it?
-What are you doing here?

61
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,681
Who keeps hitting on you?

62
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:45,725
It's not like that.

63
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:46,976
Is it this punk?

64
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,311
You're dead today!

65
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:52,023
This little bastard…

66
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:56,653
-What are you doing here?
-Mr. Gye.

67
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:57,737
Are you a prosecutor?

68
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:00,114
-What's wrong?
-A prosecutor!

69
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:02,408
-He's a prosecutor! Run!
-Hey! You jerk!

70
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:05,620
Hey!

71
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:07,789
You can't go.

72
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:11,918
-Just come peacefully.
-Gosh.

73
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:14,462
-Well?
-It's not what you think.

74
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,090
I borrowed this bike.

75
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:19,801
Okay, I'll come with you.

76
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,388
-Let's go.
-Fine.

77
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:26,391
What? Stop right there!

78
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:41,322
Damn it.

79
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,415
-Don't move!
-Who are you?

80
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:51,708
-Stop messing around!
-Let go!

81
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:52,667
-So strong…
-Let go!

82
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:56,921
Investigator Ju, hurry!

83
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:57,880
-Hey!
-Hurry up!

84
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,091
I'm coming! Careful! Thank you.

85
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,176
-Stop moving!
-Let go!

86
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,053
But how did you know
I was an investigator?

87
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:07,974
Mr. Gye told me. Like he said,
you looked so competent.

88
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:10,226
-I wonder what else he said. Stop!
-Let go, bastard!

89
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:12,937
The office couldn't run without me!

90
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,064
Are you okay? Nope, you're not.

91
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,400
-It's not okay!
-Stop moving!

92
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,944
Do you know how much trouble
you've caused me today?

93
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:22,363
There's been a misunderstanding.

94
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:23,740
Just come peacefully.

95
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:30,997
Holy cow!

96
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:32,749
That was a sick kick!

97
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,667
You're the one who started this.

98
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:35,668
Wow.

99
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:37,545
Come here.

100
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:38,921
Damn it!

101
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:47,346
They just don't listen.

102
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,223
Wait! My back!

103
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:51,059
That hurts, sir!

104
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:52,852
That hurts!

105
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:55,688
-Don't be a crybaby.
-That hurts! Damn it!

106
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:57,815
Why are you so strong?

107
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,238
Just as before,

108
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:07,241
we keep running into each other
during critical situations.

109
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:08,785
Right.

110
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,454
It's fate to meet like this again.
Should we introduce ourselves?

111
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,457
Sure. I'm Lee Mi-jin.

112
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,460
I'm Ju Byeong-deok.
Mr. Gye can't work without me.

113
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,170
I'm like his right-hand man.

114
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,547
The way you broke your fall was great.

115
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:24,467
-I'm constantly training.
-I see. Special training--

116
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,052
-Come here!
-Be careful.

117
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:27,887
Jeez.

118
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,222
Watch your head.

119
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:30,348
Mr. Gye.

120
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,184
I'll see you at the office then.

121
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:34,977
Okay, great job tonight.

122
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,562
Hey!

123
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:39,899
-It's not what you think!
-How could you? You jerk!

124
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:42,693
This is all your fault! Look at this!

125
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,112
-Damn it!
-Quiet!

126
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,114
Damn it.

127
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:50,535
What happened back there?

128
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:52,286
What?

129
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,163
What were you doing here?

130
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:56,415
I came to eat chicken.

131
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,335
If so, then why did you throw it?

132
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:03,464
That woman earlier seemed strange to me.

133
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:06,592
Who knows? She might've spiked your drink.

134
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,846
Is that why you made up
that ridiculous act earlier?

135
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:13,975
You know this is really suspicious, right?

136
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:16,477
We met at the club last time
and here tonight.

137
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:21,232
Wait, you can't possibly think
I'm stalking you or something, do you?

138
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:23,025
Maybe that could be better.

139
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:25,319
What does that mean?

140
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:28,030
By any chance…

141
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:31,993
Never mind.

142
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:36,372
What is it? It looks like you have
something to ask.

143
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,628
I heard you got a job
right after you were scammed.

144
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:43,713
What do you do now?

145
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,300
Why do you ask?

146
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:53,681
I got a job. You really don't believe me?

147
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:56,017
So tell me what you do then.

148
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,226
Where do you work?

149
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,980
At Seohan District Prosecutors' Office,
in your damn office.

150
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:04,150
Are you embarrassed to tell me?

151
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:05,610
Or is it something else?

152
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,829
The next bus will arrive soon.

153
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:24,962
If the lie is only for your sake,
is it still considered a white lie?

154
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:29,509
Either way, I believe the truth
will always be eventually revealed,

155
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,177
one way or another.

156
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,432
I don't even get thanked for helping.

157
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:39,393
And I get treated like a weirdo instead.

158
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,312
But it's true. I am a weirdo.

159
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,644
It's late. Why is she walking instead?

160
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,148
He wouldn't believe me even if I told him.

161
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,192
It's not like I don't want to tell him.

162
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,861
I can't tell him,
because I have my reasons.

163
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:31,988
And what about him?

164
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:35,324
If I ask why he doesn't trust cops,
would he tell me the truth?

165
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:36,951
He wouldn't.

166
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:40,913
In case it would make him uncomfortable…

167
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:44,250
or if it was a heartbreaking story,

168
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,004
I purposely didn't ask
despite being curious.

169
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:52,008
For a prosecutor, why is he so dense?

170
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,551
If I hadn't thrown that drumstick

171
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:56,679
and he drank that beer,
who knows what would've happened to him?

172
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:01,851
He should know to be careful
if a woman clearly looks suspicious.

173
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,688
How could he accept
every drink offered to him like a fool?

174
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,816
He doesn't even know I helped him.

175
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:11,485
All he did was glare and question me.

176
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:12,612
What a jerk.

177
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,906
He's a jerk,

178
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,034
but he's not wrong either.

179
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,286
Whatever. This sucks.

180
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:28,252
What the hell?

181
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:30,338
I'm sorry, sir.

182
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,257
What the hell?

183
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:34,550
Who are you?

184
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,178
I was aiming for the trash
but hit you by accident.

185
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:40,389
Does my head
look like a trash can, you punk?

186
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,557
I'm sorry.

187
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,851
You punk, you know who I am?

188
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:45,895
I'll tell you!

189
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,773
During my non-active military service
in Seohan,

190
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:50,941
I had meals with the chief. Did you know?

191
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:53,027
We even played table tennis, all right?

192
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,821
We did it all, you punk. Rotten punk.

193
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:01,952
Forget it.

194
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:05,373
Give me your number.

195
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:07,458
I'll give you my card.

196
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,959
Not yours.

197
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,589
What's this? Your last name is "Gye"?

198
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,011
"Gye Ji-ung"?

199
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,346
PROSECUTOR GYE JI-UNG

200
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:22,890
You're… a prosecutor.

201
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:25,935
I'm sorry.

202
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:29,688
-How's your head?
-It's fine. I'm sorry.

203
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,984
Have a great night.

204
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:35,653
Good night!

205
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:38,114
-Thank you.
-Take care. I'm sorry.

206
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:44,245
You can't kick a can like that.

207
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:47,832
-How long have you been here for?
-I don't know.

208
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:50,376
-Since when you called me a jerk?
-I see.

209
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:53,546
No, maybe it was when you said
you threw the drumstick.

210
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:55,756
I see.

211
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:58,217
Why didn't you tell me?

212
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:04,140
I thought you'd misunderstand.

213
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,893
Sometimes, not saying things
can lead to misunderstandings.

214
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:11,272
Still,

215
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,275
everyone has their own reasons.

216
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:19,697
I'll wait until you can tell me.

217
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,247
What about you?

218
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:33,043
If I wait for you,

219
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:35,421
do you think you could tell me
everything too?

220
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,592
I don't know. I've never been…

221
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:44,013
the type to open up like that.

222
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:50,436
But I think I might be able to tell you.

223
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,772
I don't know when that'll be though.

224
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:57,526
I'll wait for you.

225
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,195
I can wait.

226
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:05,743
I mean it.

227
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,831
Let's go now. It's late.

228
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,674
I'm home.

229
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:21,842
-Hey.
-Welcome back.

230
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:22,760
Hey.

231
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,262
-Come sit and have some fruit.
-Yeah.

232
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:30,809
However, next to him

233
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:33,354
is another male goose
who is attracted

234
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:35,189
to the same female goose.

235
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:36,774
Here.

236
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:39,401
When a goose picks a mate…

237
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:40,319
Mi-jin?

238
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,656
Lee Mi-jin?

239
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,408
Why are you laughing like that?

240
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,285
-What?
-Have you been drinking?

241
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,538
I wasn't drinking. Why would I?

242
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,498
Judging by these mood swings,

243
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:54,750
did you take
your mom's menopausal medicine?

244
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:56,293
What are you saying?

245
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,003
-I didn't take it.
-I'm joking!

246
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:00,965
Come on.

247
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:08,180
-By the way, Mom and Dad…
-Yes?

248
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:11,600
If someone says they could only tell me

249
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,770
something they couldn't tell anyone else,
what does that mean?

250
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:16,814
Who said that? Mr. Gye?

251
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:18,941
What did he say? When?

252
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,777
He can tell you
because that's how much he trusts you.

253
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:25,823
It means he trusts you.
He thinks of you on his side.

254
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:28,534
Yeah, it's solid trust.

255
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:35,207
Seriously, Dad. You're so sensitive.

256
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,501
What about me?

257
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:40,337
You know how to kill the mood, Mom.

258
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,923
I'm so tired. I'm full.

259
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,049
I did what?

260
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,385
You brat!

261
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:50,097
Honey, did I kill the mood?

262
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,056
No.

263
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,224
-Nonsense, right?
-No.

264
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,392
You brat!

265
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:55,519
Your dad said I didn't kill the mood!

266
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,062
She's so dense though.

267
00:14:57,938 --> 00:15:01,066
SEOHAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

268
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,244
So what happened with that woman?

269
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,000
What's going on with you two?

270
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:27,843
You're as cold as ice, but if you
took her home, it means you're very close.

271
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:29,887
Goodness!

272
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:31,805
Are you okay?

273
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,975
I was so caught up
in your fun conversation.

274
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:37,311
Jeez, so you like these kinds of stories?

275
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,898
Look how happy he seems.
You're in a relationship, right?

276
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:43,817
What are you talking about?
When did I ever look unhappy?

277
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:47,363
You can just whisper it to me.

278
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,073
Is she your girlfriend? Or a fling?

279
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,407
Get to work, please.

280
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:59,166
This is because the oxytocin
is surging through him.

281
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:02,586
Have you ever seen
the women he's dated before?

282
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,129
Women?

283
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:07,549
Other than female suspects, victims,
or ex-cons, there haven't been any.

284
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,135
He lives a very dull and dreary life.

285
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,503
Among the trash, I'm the bottom
of the barrel. I'm a nobody.

286
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:46,505
There's someone else who's in charge!

287
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:50,592
You're not even in charge,
but you gave drugs to minors without fear?

288
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:53,887
I was just giving them a little taste…

289
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,182
Why don't you set up
a free sample stand too then?

290
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,685
Damn it, I'm going to go insane!

291
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:01,020
It's too early for that.

292
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,731
Two prior drug convictions
and a statement

293
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:06,525
that says you gave drugs
to minors while on probation.

294
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:08,444
It'll be hard to avoid severe punishment.

295
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,487
It really wasn't me!

296
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,948
Don't shout.

297
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:20,414
Okay.

298
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:22,708
Then, how about this?

299
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,336
We won't detain you
if you disclose the supplier.

300
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:29,715
Your girlfriend didn't have any priors.

301
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:32,217
Her life could be ruined
for meeting the wrong guy.

302
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:35,345
You don't want her
to resent you forever, do you?

303
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,097
Don't touch my girlfriend.

304
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:38,891
She has nothing to do with this.

305
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:41,393
We caught her at the scene.
What do you take us for?

306
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,147
But who knows?

307
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:49,318
If I write up this report neatly,
it could end in a dismissal, right?

308
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:50,903
Of course.

309
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,822
He's known for writing them very neatly.

310
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,418
Excuse me, sir?

311
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:10,547
I receive the patches
once or twice a week,

312
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:11,882
and I only deliver them.

313
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:15,135
Sometimes, I would pocket a few

314
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,262
and used the money for dates.

315
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,640
I only took a few. That's it.

316
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,809
And the delivery method?

317
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,102
Who, when, and how?

318
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,896
When the people who book
on the dark web come to the club,

319
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:28,148
we put it all together with drinks

320
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:30,275
and deliver it to their rooms.

321
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:31,485
But it's not just alcohol.

322
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:33,112
Come on. Of course, it's not.

323
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,322
We pick a few pretty girls,

324
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:37,449
and we send them in too.

325
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:41,286
So these unsuspecting young girls
who are picked up by the wrong guys

326
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,163
have their drinks spiked and are molested?

327
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:45,165
Well, I don't know all that.

328
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,501
-They're the ones who--
-You little punk.

329
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:48,669
-You little…
-Wait, don't.

330
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:50,504
Hold on.

331
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:51,922
Request an arrest warrant.

332
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:53,382
You said I wouldn't be detained.

333
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:58,470
You should've told us something useful.

334
00:18:58,554 --> 00:18:59,680
-But--
-Don't worry.

335
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:02,141
I'll write exactly
what you both did in the report

336
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,184
for harsher punishment too.

337
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:07,771
Wait, sir!

338
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:09,523
Hey! Wait!

339
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:11,024
Wait! Hey!

340
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,860
Hold on. That's not what you said!

341
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:14,528
Wait!

342
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:16,655
That hurts!

343
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:20,117
The club guys will start to move
if they hear an arrest was made.

344
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,494
Shouldn't we retrieve the drugs
before arresting them?

345
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,246
There are too many to retrieve.

346
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:27,332
Seeing as how those kids had them,
they were spread intentionally.

347
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,085
If we follow the trail,
it'll lead to the supplier.

348
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:33,046
I have them on my radar,
so I'll check often.

349
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,302
Hello, boss.

350
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:40,929
We took care of the goods. Don't worry.

351
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:44,266
They won't be able to connect us.

352
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,018
We can cut all the loose ends.

353
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:47,978
So I was thinking,

354
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:49,771
if you just held onto the goods…

355
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,150
Damn it.

356
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:54,776
Where should I send them?

357
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,820
It's best to bury them.

358
00:19:58,113 --> 00:19:59,948
Let's go to Obongsan Mountain!

359
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,033
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

360
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:02,784
PRINCE

361
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,211
-What are you doing?
-What?

362
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:13,253
Me?

363
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,048
-I was taking out the trash.
-Damn it.

364
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:17,549
Dump it and get lost!

365
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:18,634
Yes, boss!

366
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:29,061
What do I do?

367
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:34,775
-Yeah?
-Hello?

368
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:36,818
-They're quickly moving the goods.
-To where?

369
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,779
-I don't know that.
-You don't?

370
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:42,783
-You punk--
-Well, they said they'd bury them.

371
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:45,786
Do your job properly, you punk.
Get it together. Find out quickly.

372
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:50,082
Don't think of running either.
I'll chase you down.

373
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,545
Man, I'd like to hit him.

374
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:56,922
That punk.

375
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:01,760
Ms. Lim.

376
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:03,679
-Just take these.
-Okay.

377
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,055
I don't think I need the cart.

378
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:06,556
-Okay.
-I can just take them.

379
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:10,686
Thank you.

380
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:13,021
Ms. Seo Sun-deok?

381
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:14,606
Yes.

382
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:25,075
Lim Sun!

383
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:32,916
Don't you remember me?

384
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:35,419
I'm not sure.

385
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:37,462
I'm Seo Sun-deok from Seohan Bank.

386
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,715
We worked together at the Myeongil branch.

387
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:42,801
I think you have the wrong person.

388
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:45,804
I'm so sorry.

389
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,015
You look just like Lim Sun.

390
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:50,600
I'm sorry.

391
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:54,980
I thought you were a friend I used to
work with at the bank. I'm sorry.

392
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:57,774
No, it's fine.

393
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,110
-Have a good day.
-You too.

394
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:05,157
That's definitely Lim Sun.

395
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:44,654
LIM SUN? OLD LADY
A WOMAN IN HER TWENTIES?

396
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,828
This is Seohan District
Prosecutors' Office.

397
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:54,039
Yes, I'll transfer you.

398
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:57,459
CIVIL COMPLAINTS DEPARTMENT

399
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,178
Won, you have a call.

400
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:10,514
Won?

401
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:12,182
Yes?

402
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,101
The phone.

403
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:15,769
Right.

404
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,482
This is Seohan District
Prosecutors' Office.

405
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:23,819
All of it was done,
so all these people came and…

406
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:26,029
The deputy chief has arrived.

407
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:27,322
Hello, sir.

408
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:28,990
Hello. Thank you for your work.

409
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:31,076
-Take a seat.
-Yes, sir.

410
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:35,664
-Make yourself comfortable.
-We are, sir.

411
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:40,252
Our new intern, Baek Cheol-gyu,

412
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:42,546
wants to treat everyone
to a company dinner.

413
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:45,465
We'll have the dinner tomorrow night.

414
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:49,386
We expected nothing less
from a local pillar.

415
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:50,762
He's so generous too.

416
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,347
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

417
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,559
But I have dinner plans.

418
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:57,310
Again?

419
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:59,688
You're always trying to take off at night.

420
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,731
Why do we need to have it at night?

421
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,448
Don't be scared!

422
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:13,994
You're not in your twenties.
You can say whatever you want.

423
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:16,288
I'm quite old now. So what?

424
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:19,207
I'm sure there are people
who don't want to go, right?

425
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:23,086
To be honest,
it's not like you're paying us overtime.

426
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,338
We can't pick what we want to eat either.

427
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:29,301
You'd get indigestion while trying
to please and humor your bosses.

428
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:31,761
Also, we'd be lucky if it ends early,

429
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:35,348
but if our superiors get in the mood,
we'll be dragged around all night

430
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:37,267
hearing the same story again and again.

431
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,394
After our ears start to bleed,

432
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:41,438
we'd barely escape
and make it home by midnight.

433
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:44,441
And we wouldn't be able to enjoy

434
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:47,110
the weekend properly
due to being hungover.

435
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:49,029
So who are these dinners really for?

436
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,698
I'm sure they're not for me.

437
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:54,201
I don't think they would be for me.

438
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:02,375
Well, when did I ever force
company dinners on anyone?

439
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:04,794
You can come if you want to.

440
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,213
You're free to do what you want.

441
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:08,173
-Absolutely.
-Of course, sir.

442
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:11,218
If there's anyone who doesn't want
to attend, let me know.

443
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:13,970
It's okay. You can tell me.

444
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,055
There aren't any.

445
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:17,015
As for the food,

446
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:20,101
I mean, do we only eat pork belly?

447
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,269
We have skin-on pork belly.

448
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,521
We eat beef belly too. What's the issue?

449
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:26,650
What is it?
Tell me if there's something you want.

450
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:28,318
It's okay. You can tell me.

451
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:30,737
Okay, then I'll tell you.

452
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:33,657
It's not because I want
to eat something in particular.

453
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,659
The odor gets on our clothes.

454
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:40,372
Rather than a barbecue place
where young coworkers have to grill meat,

455
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:43,500
wouldn't something like
a French restaurant be better?

456
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:47,295
Sure! French it is!

457
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:49,506
I like French cuisine too!

458
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:50,548
Let's go!

459
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,133
Let's go eat some French food!

460
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:53,260
It sounds great.

461
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:54,719
Let's go with French.

462
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,346
What else?

463
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:57,639
Having it at night?

464
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,307
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

465
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:02,394
Then, let's have it
at 4:00 p.m. tomorrow. Okay?

466
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:05,146
Okay, then I'll attend too.

467
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,440
-Okay, then it's settled.
-Yes, sir.

468
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:08,984
Okay, then.

469
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:15,323
In return,

470
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:18,618
come to work by 7:00 a.m. tomorrow.

471
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:19,995
-What?
-7:00 a.m.?

472
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:28,295
-Come on!
-Seriously?

473
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:30,213
You get up early though.

474
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:32,424
I like to sleep in!

475
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:33,383
Jeez.

476
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:34,592
How about some stretching?

477
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,855
-Hey.
-Hey, Won.

478
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:48,732
I looked into what you asked for.

479
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:49,733
What did you find?

480
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:52,610
So the person who saved you, Lim Sun?

481
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:54,654
She's quite unusual.

482
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,324
-What do you mean?
-There aren't any records of her.

483
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:00,201
-What?
-She doesn't have any records.

484
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:03,663
How can someone go through life
without ever getting a ticket?

485
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:04,664
Is she a real person?

486
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:05,790
Besides that,

487
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:07,792
you'd think she at least
had a phone, right?

488
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:11,171
But there's no record
of her activating one.

489
00:27:13,631 --> 00:27:15,342
-There was nothing?
-Nothing.

490
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:18,345
Well, about 23 or 24 years ago,

491
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:20,638
there was
a canceled missing person report.

492
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:22,140
There's no trace after that.

493
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:23,850
Okay, I see.

494
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:29,814
A person who disappeared
more than 20 years ago…

495
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:33,902
Why is she here?

496
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:32,627
PC INTERNET CAFE

497
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:41,344
Wow, holy cow. Aim is on point today.

498
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:42,679
What's with this guy?

499
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:47,350
Wait a second. Today's…

500
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:49,185
We might dominate today.

501
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,062
Let's just get ten wins today.

502
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:53,314
Once I fill my item stats,
I'll sell them all.

503
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,817
What? You came through the back?

504
00:28:57,694 --> 00:28:58,945
Welcome.

505
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:00,864
Do you have an account?

506
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:02,240
I'll just surf the web.

507
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:03,992
You can sit wherever you like.

508
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:09,497
I'm sure she came in here.

509
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:18,715
Okay! You're all dead!

510
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:20,800
All dead!

511
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,428
Okay! We can do this!

512
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:24,846
You can do it, Lee Mi-jin.

513
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:30,310
This is nuts. Come on.

514
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,228
I'll get you.

515
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,526
Why do you play like this? What?

516
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,615
-Excuse me?
-What the hell?

517
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:45,784
Come on.

518
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:48,203
What kind of play was that?

519
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,582
Okay, good.

520
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:55,585
Nice.

521
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:06,971
"HE WHO WANTS TO GO HOME"
HAS SENT YOU A MESSAGE

522
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,515
We need a mercenary for a clan war.

523
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:10,225
I can do that. I can do it all.

524
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:19,901
Voice chat costs extra, but I'll give you
a discount for Ranked Matches.

525
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:22,237
Come on! It's me!

526
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:23,947
-Me!
-I'll take it all.

527
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:26,157
-There you go.
-Help me get to Diamond in Ranked.

528
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:29,619
That's 300,000 won,
so 1.8 million total! Nice!

529
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,289
I'm so good. Seriously.

530
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:35,333
I deserve to eat this ramyeon today.

531
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:36,751
This is insane.

532
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:39,587
Nice.

533
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:43,675
It's so hot but so good.

534
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:50,932
You've never seen anyone
eat ramyeon before?

535
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:00,483
My goodness.

536
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:02,360
Why is this here?

537
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:06,197
I'm so sorry! I thought this was mine.

538
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:08,074
It had two eggs.

539
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:11,703
No one else has ever ordered it
like this here before.

540
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:13,413
If you don't mind,

541
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:16,207
I'll order you a new one.

542
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:23,172
It's okay. I can do it.

543
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:26,759
That scar…

544
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:29,178
I got it as a kid
while playing with a cat.

545
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:30,889
Doesn't this look like a heart?

546
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:32,682
It's like my tattoo.

547
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:37,478
Do you eat kimchi?

548
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:39,689
Kimchi.

549
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:49,073
So the person who saved you, Lim Sun?

550
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,575
There aren't any records of her.

551
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:52,869
She doesn't have any records.

552
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:35,954
What?

553
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:38,498
Where did he go?

554
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:39,666
Damn it.

555
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:42,085
I added three eggs. How could he leave?

556
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:46,464
What?

557
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,050
My keychain.

558
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:53,763
Where did I drop this?

559
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:11,966
Call me right away
if something dangerous happens.

560
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,010
It doesn't matter when or where.

561
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:29,859
Hello?

562
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:33,529
Hello?

563
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:36,324
Mi-jin?

564
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,326
Hello?

565
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:42,246
I'm sorry. I called you by accident.

566
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:44,290
Is something wrong?

567
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:45,458
No, nothing's wrong.

568
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:47,835
No, really. It's fine. I'm sorry.

569
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:54,842
I'll head over right now.

570
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,803
You don't even know where I am.

571
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:59,263
You're off work,
so you're probably near your house.

572
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:01,057
No, it's really okay.

573
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:01,974
I just…

574
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:06,270
I thought a suspicious car
was following me.

575
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:10,566
After you told me about that killer,
I guess it had me spooked.

576
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:12,985
Are you really okay?

577
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:15,113
Of course. I really am fine.

578
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:17,532
Gosh, it's already so far away.

579
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:18,616
I can't even see it.

580
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:20,326
I'm hanging up now.

581
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:21,285
Wait…

582
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:14,297
All right! It's on the house tonight
at Crazy Tasty Butcher Shop!

583
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:19,218
CELEBRATING DAUGHTER'S
FIRST PAY AS CIVIL SERVANT

584
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:22,096
Hey, bakery shop! Come on over!

585
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,726
-Crazy Tasty Butcher Shop is buying!
-Hurry on over!

586
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:28,603
Hey, pig's trotters shop!
Come and eat!

587
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,271
Where are the bakery folks?

588
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,648
Mi-jin!

589
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,525
You're finally here!

590
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:37,361
This party's for you, you brat!

591
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:39,447
What took you so long?

592
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:40,948
Come over here.

593
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,783
Everyone, Mi-jin's here!

594
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,000
-Sure thing!
-Hey!

595
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:55,504
I'm here too.
I've grilled 25 kilograms of pork.

596
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:56,589
The meat's here!

597
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:57,882
Goodness!

598
00:36:57,965 --> 00:36:59,217
My goodness.

599
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:01,302
Hey, Mi-jin.

600
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:02,845
What's with all this meat?

601
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,889
Today's a special day.

602
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:06,390
After eight long years,

603
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:09,727
my daughter received her first paycheck!

604
00:37:12,855 --> 00:37:14,774
Take a look. I even did my hair.

605
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:17,068
-Goodness.
-I went to the salon.

606
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:18,694
Mom, that's enough. Please.

607
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:20,154
Why?

608
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:23,324
It won't cost me that much
to brag a little like this.

609
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:26,869
Everyone here had been thinking
and worrying about you so much.

610
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:28,162
I'm so grateful to them.

611
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:30,748
Mi-jin, every time you took the exam,

612
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:33,751
I pulled out countless rice cakes for you.

613
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:35,211
You passed because of that.

614
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:38,422
That's not why.

615
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:41,217
It's because we brewed
pots of Korean medicine for her.

616
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,636
I'd say that played a crucial role.

617
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:46,013
-You're right!
-Good for you!

618
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,223
Okay.

619
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:48,891
Say, "Thank you."

620
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:50,935
Thank you.

621
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,773
So when is this going to end?

622
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:56,857
When?

623
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:59,443
-At 100 kilograms.
-What? 100 kilograms?

624
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:00,528
A hundred kilograms!

625
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:05,825
Enough. You drank so much you're drunk.

626
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:07,493
Bring me some more soju.

627
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:08,619
Stop drinking.

628
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:10,997
Stop drinking. Let's go.

629
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:15,084
-That's enough. Go home now. My goodness.
-Mi-jin!

630
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:16,294
-Thanks!
-Okay, bye!

631
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:18,379
-Thanks!
-Goodness, he's drunk.

632
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:19,630
Goodness.

633
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:22,717
Go in and rest. You've worked all day.

634
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,094
Your dad and I can clean this.

635
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:26,887
-Go in and rest.
-It's fine.

636
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:29,849
You both worked all day too.
We can clean it faster together.

637
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:34,520
Lim Sun.

638
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:35,730
Don't you remember me?

639
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:37,940
I'm Seo Sun-deok from Seohan Bank.

640
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:40,192
We worked together at the Myeongil Branch.

641
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,031
-Mom.
-Yes?

642
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:47,491
When Aunt Sun disappeared…

643
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:51,579
I mean,

644
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,582
when she left home…

645
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:58,252
Wasn't she working at a bank?

646
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:00,588
What about it?

647
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:05,051
Didn't she suddenly quit back then?
She'd worked there for years.

648
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,679
Yeah, it was her first job.
She was there for a long time.

649
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:12,141
But why? Why are you asking about that?

650
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:14,935
No reason.

651
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:17,980
I just thought about her a lot today.

652
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:27,865
Goodness, they sure did stuff their faces.

653
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:40,669
That's right.

654
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,089
Today's the company dinner.

655
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:55,393
SEOHAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

656
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:09,323
MY FATHER DISAPPEARED! PLEASE FIND HIM!

657
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:12,785
HE WORKED AT SEOHAN DISTRICT
PROSECUTORS' OFFICE WHEN HE DISAPPEARED

658
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:16,455
There you all are.

659
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:17,915
Did you ride your bike here today?

660
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:20,042
I left it at home
since we have dinner today.

661
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:23,129
That's right.
Drunk driving applies to bicycles too.

662
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:24,130
Good job.

663
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:25,381
Good grief.

664
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:28,968
Why do we have to come to work
at the crack of dawn just for a dinner?

665
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:31,595
I'm sorry for the inconvenience I caused.

666
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:34,098
Please have some tea.

667
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:36,142
You didn't do anything wrong.

668
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:37,476
Actually,

669
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,687
I'm a morning person, so I'm grateful.

670
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,772
Think of your age.

671
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:44,150
You still sleep in? Jeez.

672
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:47,236
Don't you know beautiful women
need their beauty sleep?

673
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:48,320
Yeah, sure.

674
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:49,530
Goodness.

675
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:51,490
Aren't you ashamed to say that yourself?

676
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:55,202
You excrete melatonin hormones
when you sleep.

677
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,830
It's closely associated with our skin,

678
00:40:57,913 --> 00:41:00,332
so she's not wrong.

679
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,375
See.

680
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:04,420
As expected,
educated people are so different.

681
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,509
Goodness.

682
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:13,095
Thank you.

683
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:16,265
Are you left-handed?

684
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:18,851
Yes.

685
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,316
Yes! Just a moment!

686
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:26,317
Coming!

687
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:28,027
Who is it?

688
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:30,863
Yes, hello.

689
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:33,324
-Certified mail for Lee Mi-jin.
-Okay.

690
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:34,992
Thank you.

691
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:39,747
"Seohan Provincial Police Agency"?

692
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:46,462
-What is it?
-It's nothing.

693
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:50,508
It's about the Lee clan gathering.
It's just a notification.

694
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:53,844
Goodness, whenever you
get together with them,

695
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:55,971
you all try to rip each other apart.

696
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:57,681
Lee clan, my foot.

697
00:41:58,307 --> 00:41:59,350
I'm going out.

698
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:28,837
Mi-jin, are you going to be late tonight?

699
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:30,839
-Yeah, I have a dinner.
-Come home early.

700
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:33,050
Be careful. Don't drink too much.

701
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:40,933
We're off work early today,
so let's all wrap things up.

702
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:45,771
I put together the list of vehicles
ending in 6438. Should I print them out?

703
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:47,523
Just a moment.

704
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:51,819
Yes, Detective Kwon.

705
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:54,196
I looked into your request

706
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:57,366
about the detective who handled
the old missing persons cases.

707
00:42:57,449 --> 00:42:58,659
Right. Did you find him?

708
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:01,328
I don't think meeting with him
will help though.

709
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:04,248
Let me see him first.

710
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:05,416
Text me the address.

711
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:10,129
Email it to me.
Something urgent came up. I have to go.

712
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:13,257
What about the company dinner tonight?

713
00:43:13,882 --> 00:43:14,883
Company dinner…

714
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:23,017
Mr. Cha!

715
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,018
It's so good!

716
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:25,686
Can we order one more pizza?

717
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:26,645
Order all you want!

718
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:28,606
-Yeah!
-Thank you!

719
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:30,274
Mr. Cha!

720
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:34,486
The chef heard where we're from
and prepared this for us on the house.

721
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:36,947
This isn't bad.

722
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:39,408
The food's good and so is the ambience.

723
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:42,369
But where's Gye?

724
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:45,456
Well…

725
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:50,127
Mr. Gye.

726
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:51,587
Something urgent came up.

727
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:54,423
Mr. Cha said attendance wasn't mandatory.

728
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:55,716
Still…

729
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:58,469
Of course, it's not mandatory.
Did I say it was?

730
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:05,225
Okay. One, two, three.

731
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:11,649
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

732
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:14,902
Mr. Ko Won!

733
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:16,487
Come here.

734
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,078
You're on non-active military duty.

735
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:25,746
Work's over. Why are you here?

736
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:28,832
I came for the company dinner.

737
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:35,214
He wanted to come,
and I couldn't stop him.

738
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:36,256
Jeez.

739
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:39,718
Those who should come don't attend.
Those who don't need to do attend.

740
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:45,015
What was that?

741
00:44:46,558 --> 00:44:47,559
Well…

742
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,061
This is a bit tough.

743
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:50,646
Have some.

744
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:58,404
Have some of this too.

745
00:44:59,905 --> 00:45:00,906
Is that her?

746
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:04,076
The lady working for Mr. Gye.

747
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:05,953
She's lasting a long time.

748
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:08,330
Still, hiring an old lady's a bit much.

749
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:09,873
Is the prosecutors' office a joke?

750
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:11,333
Right.

751
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:13,085
She's a good worker.

752
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:17,214
She's laid-back and handles tasks well.

753
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:20,926
Unlike young people these days.
she's motivated and doesn't try to shirk.

754
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:22,678
There's nothing to criticize.

755
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:27,808
She would have to be like that
to work with Ji-ung.

756
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:31,645
Mr. Gye doesn't hold back when he works.

757
00:45:31,728 --> 00:45:33,272
He's so reckless.

758
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:35,482
That's why we get along so well.

759
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:37,985
I act wild when I get pissed too.

760
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:50,914
Goodness.

761
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:57,713
Your wife must be so happy
to have such a sweet husband like you.

762
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:00,299
I suppose.

763
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:02,843
If only she had lived longer,

764
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:05,888
I would've taken care of her for life.

765
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:08,474
Goodness. Then, you're a widower.

766
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:10,767
So you're living alone

767
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:13,770
after losing your wife.

768
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:16,023
What about your children?

769
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:19,485
After going abroad to study,
they settled down there.

770
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:21,320
I haven't seen them in years.

771
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:22,988
My goodness.

772
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:27,910
You've been doing
an amazing job on your own.

773
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:29,244
Let me pour you a glass.

774
00:46:30,704 --> 00:46:31,914
I have to drive.

775
00:46:31,997 --> 00:46:32,873
It's fine.

776
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:35,334
-Just one drink.
-That's okay.

777
00:46:36,251 --> 00:46:37,419
If that's the case,

778
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:41,089
I'll drink it for you.

779
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:42,841
In return, you have to grant me a wish.

780
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:46,553
Bottoms up.

781
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:50,098
That sounded more
like a threat than a request.

782
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:51,058
Good grief.

783
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:53,352
I'm starting to feel nauseous.

784
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:56,230
Do you have any kimchi here?

785
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:57,147
Eat up.

786
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:59,816
You should have a proper meal.

787
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:02,736
Shiny, shiny

788
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:06,865
Shiny, shiny

789
00:47:08,825 --> 00:47:09,910
Shiny, shiny

790
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:17,626
She's so beautiful

791
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:21,922
Wow! You're a great singer, Mr. Cha!

792
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:23,549
Gosh, you're embarrassing me!

793
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:26,134
My throat is a bit sore today.

794
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:27,594
Hey!

795
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:30,222
What's with the vibe here?

796
00:47:30,305 --> 00:47:31,932
It's because you're not drinking.

797
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:33,517
Come on. Raise your glasses!

798
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,102
Everyone, down the hatch!

799
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:36,395
Bottoms up!

800
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:39,773
Come on!

801
00:47:39,856 --> 00:47:40,857
Come out and sing!

802
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,569
Okay, sing a song.

803
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:46,572
Won, could you sing a song for us?

804
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:48,657
Sing one of the songs you wrote.

805
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:49,950
Sing a song.

806
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:54,329
That wouldn't be fair.
I'll just be part of the audience today.

807
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:57,082
Ms. Lim, don't just sit there either.

808
00:47:57,165 --> 00:47:58,292
Sing us a song.

809
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:01,628
She's not singing because she can't.
Don't provoke her.

810
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:04,506
Turning a blind eye
is more helpful at times like these.

811
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:06,133
Come on. No way!

812
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:08,885
You listen to music all day.

813
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:11,555
You always have those round pebbles
stuck in your ears!

814
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:13,932
My throat's not feeling great today.

815
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:15,434
I don't feel well.

816
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:17,436
Come on, now!

817
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:19,187
Okay, starting now,

818
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:21,481
I'll give a coupon to anyone
who gets a perfect score!

819
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:23,650
A coupon?

820
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,527
-It's not for coffee, is it?
-No!

821
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:28,113
A coupon of your choice!

822
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:30,115
Anything we want?

823
00:48:30,198 --> 00:48:31,074
Even for work tasks?

824
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:32,117
What about a bonus?

825
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,410
A bonus?

826
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:36,913
Whatever your wish is,
I'll grant it for you!

827
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:37,998
I promise!

828
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:39,916
Have it notarized!

829
00:48:41,209 --> 00:48:43,670
This song would be a hit!

830
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:44,755
Hold on!

831
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:48,258
"MR Chu"? What's that?

832
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:03,148
When I see you once,
I want to see you two more times

833
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:06,902
If I see you two, three times,
I want to hug you even more

834
00:49:06,985 --> 00:49:10,864
I want to wear couple rings with you

835
00:49:10,947 --> 00:49:14,993
And walk down this road together

836
00:49:15,577 --> 00:49:18,955
Even though I see you every day,
I like you even more

837
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:22,459
Even when I pinch myself
two, three times

838
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:25,212
It's like I'm dreaming, dreaming

839
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:27,172
It's like I'm in a dream

840
00:49:27,255 --> 00:49:31,426
I smile at just the thought of you

841
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:35,597
Mr. Chu
On my lips, chu

842
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:37,933
Sweetly, chu

843
00:49:38,016 --> 00:49:41,937
I lose all strength in my body

844
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:44,773
You shake up my heart
You shake me up

845
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,860
I'm falling, falling for your love

846
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:51,905
Hey, you
On my lips, chu

847
00:49:51,988 --> 00:49:54,241
Every day with you

848
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:57,202
When I see you, my eyes close

849
00:49:57,285 --> 00:50:01,081
Will you secretly come to me
And kiss me again?

850
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:06,086
You're like my dream
You're my Mr. Chu

851
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:12,092
Jeez.

852
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:14,302
What's with me?

853
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:15,887
I didn't even drink that much.

854
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:19,141
Do drinking limits age too?

855
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:43,457
What the hell?

856
00:51:08,273 --> 00:51:10,275
Wait a second. Let's see.

857
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:11,485
It goes this way.

858
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:14,446
How did they do it?

859
00:51:24,998 --> 00:51:26,291
It's tangled now.

860
00:51:29,085 --> 00:51:31,254
NEULPALAN NURSING HOME

861
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:39,346
Find the starting point
and solve it from there.

862
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:47,521
Please find her!

863
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:48,772
Find my mom!

864
00:51:48,855 --> 00:51:51,566
I know you hated her,
but you still always visited her!

865
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:53,235
Jeez, this is getting old.

866
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:56,071
You've done this for days now!
So what, then?

867
00:51:56,154 --> 00:51:59,032
Are you saying
it's my fault she disappeared?

868
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:02,410
Find her! Bring back my mom!

869
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:03,370
You little punk.

870
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:05,956
Don't you move. Stay right there!

871
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:07,457
Go.

872
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:09,376
Find her!

873
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:11,837
Find my mom!

874
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,713
You're a bad detective!

875
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:15,173
Find her!

876
00:52:17,175 --> 00:52:19,010
Find my mom!

877
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:20,720
Find her!

878
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:24,182
You said all cops were bad.

879
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:27,686
When you were shouting, I said,

880
00:52:27,769 --> 00:52:30,939
"Kids like you always get arrested
when you grow up

881
00:52:31,022 --> 00:52:32,858
and ruin your lives."

882
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:36,111
Yeah.

883
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:39,614
Thanks to those wise words,
I'm doing well as a civil servant.

884
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:43,577
Gosh, you're so persistent.

885
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:51,835
I came just in case.

886
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:54,880
But I think I wasted my time.

887
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:06,141
If it's been tangled for too long,

888
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,562
it's better to just cut it off.

889
00:53:25,785 --> 00:53:26,620
Goodness.

890
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:29,331
Hey, Gyeong-hui.

891
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:31,666
You're being too harsh.

892
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:35,712
Don't be like that.
Just help me this one time.

893
00:53:36,671 --> 00:53:37,923
How many times have I told you?

894
00:53:38,006 --> 00:53:39,215
I didn't see anything.

895
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:40,967
I couldn't see anything.

896
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:43,261
I know. You didn't see anything.

897
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:44,763
But what about a glimpse?

898
00:53:44,846 --> 00:53:47,057
-Even a little glimpse is enough.
-Damn it.

899
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:49,100
Get out! Just go!

900
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:50,560
Are you crazy?

901
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:55,106
It's all broken! Seriously?

902
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:59,319
Look, I know I'm forcing someone
to do something they don't want to.

903
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:01,780
I hate this too.

904
00:54:01,863 --> 00:54:03,782
But we don't have any evidence.

905
00:54:03,865 --> 00:54:05,909
We can't identify the culprit.

906
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:08,954
Even if we wanted to,
there's no way to catch them.

907
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:10,830
In any case,

908
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:13,166
I didn't see anything
that day even if I did.

909
00:54:13,249 --> 00:54:14,084
Understand?

910
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:17,462
Then, are you saying
that even though someone's missing,

911
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:19,714
you'll sit back and do nothing?

912
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:21,299
Damn it! Did I hide her?

913
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:23,259
I don't care where they went!

914
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:25,595
-I don't know anything!
-Wait.

915
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:26,846
-Get lost!
-Wait!

916
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,515
-Get lost!
-It's not that!

917
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:29,933
Hold on!

918
00:54:30,392 --> 00:54:31,434
Come on!

919
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:33,561
Wait! Just listen!

920
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:35,230
We need your help to capture them!

921
00:54:35,313 --> 00:54:37,524
I heard everything from Madame Kwak!

922
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:40,610
I know you saw something
in the alley behind Seohan Bank!

923
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:42,153
I know you saw something!

924
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:43,113
Seriously?

925
00:54:43,196 --> 00:54:45,031
You're really going to be like this?

926
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:45,949
Wait!

927
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:47,492
Put yourself in our shoes!

928
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:15,061
Mom.

929
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:16,438
Don't cry.

930
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:19,232
I'm scared.

931
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:22,360
I'm so scared.

932
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:24,738
I pretended like I didn't know.

933
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:28,950
Don't cry, Mom.

934
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:45,216
Mr. Gye, here's the list of silver SUVs
ending in 6438 that you asked for.

935
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,010
I'm sending it to you by email now.

936
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:53,058
OFFICE ASSISTANT LIM SUN

937
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:54,768
INVESTIGATOR JU BYEONG-DEOK

938
00:55:57,479 --> 00:55:58,313
Hello?

939
00:55:58,396 --> 00:56:00,148
When are you going to come?

940
00:56:00,231 --> 00:56:03,151
Ms. Lim just tore up the stage
with her cuteness.

941
00:56:03,985 --> 00:56:05,028
Ms. Lim?

942
00:56:05,111 --> 00:56:08,615
Yes. The karaoke you hate so much

943
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:10,909
wrapped up just now.

944
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:12,702
For round three…

945
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:14,370
It'll be soju and spicy fish roe soup.

946
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:16,706
He'll repeat the same story.
An infinite loop.

947
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:20,376
Mr. Cha said attendance
wasn't mandatory, but you know him.

948
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:21,878
He holds grudges.

949
00:56:21,961 --> 00:56:23,338
It'll affect me too.

950
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:26,257
-By chance, did you know?
-What?

951
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:28,551
Baek Cheol-gyu was
Hwadong Medical Center's director.

952
00:56:29,677 --> 00:56:30,887
He was?

953
00:56:31,596 --> 00:56:32,847
Yeah, isn't that crazy?

954
00:56:32,931 --> 00:56:34,891
He's a well-known local pillar.

955
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:43,191
PLATE NUMBER 6438

956
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:05,797
This is for your ears only, but…

957
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:08,174
Wait a second. What?

958
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:09,175
What is it?

959
00:57:09,801 --> 00:57:10,927
Never mind.

960
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:13,263
-Have fun.
-Mr. Gye, wait!

961
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:29,654
That scared me.

962
00:57:38,246 --> 00:57:39,706
She's so beautiful

963
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:42,125
She's so beautiful

964
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:43,126
Nice!

965
00:57:43,209 --> 00:57:45,545
I told you it's true!

966
00:57:45,628 --> 00:57:47,755
But that bottle of beer!

967
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:49,716
Ms. Lim!

968
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:52,135
You were incredible!

969
00:57:52,218 --> 00:57:53,720
I mean! Wow!

970
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:56,306
You're still a spring chicken!

971
00:57:57,682 --> 00:57:59,309
Hey, the time!

972
00:57:59,392 --> 00:58:01,311
Look at the time! It's still early!

973
00:58:01,394 --> 00:58:02,896
Okay!

974
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:04,230
Let's go for a third round!

975
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:07,233
Third round will be soju
and spicy fish roe soup!

976
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:08,651
Okay, let's go!

977
00:58:09,235 --> 00:58:10,069
Let's go.

978
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:12,113
Hurry, let's go!

979
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:14,866
Who should I call him as?

980
00:58:16,242 --> 00:58:17,827
He didn't call me.

981
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:21,206
He called Lim Sun's phone.

982
00:58:21,289 --> 00:58:22,373
LIM SUN, LEE MI-JIN

983
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:23,500
It wasn't Mi-jin.

984
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:25,919
I'll call with Lim Sun's number then.

985
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:28,379
PROSECUTOR GYE JI-UNG

986
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:34,344
DOCUMENTS

987
00:58:36,888 --> 00:58:37,722
Hello?

988
00:58:37,805 --> 00:58:39,891
I didn't get a perfect score.

989
00:58:39,974 --> 00:58:41,017
Wait…

990
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:41,976
Go ahead.

991
00:58:46,898 --> 00:58:47,732
I just…

992
00:58:47,815 --> 00:58:50,151
I thought a suspicious car
was following me.

993
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:53,905
After you told me about that killer,
I guess it had me spooked.

994
00:58:56,074 --> 00:58:57,617
DOCUMENTS

995
00:59:26,312 --> 00:59:27,438
You have to go home.

996
00:59:27,855 --> 00:59:28,690
Hey!

997
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:32,485
The dinner's just starting to get fun.

998
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:36,072
Why are you trying to ruin it? Let go.

999
00:59:36,656 --> 00:59:37,949
I said let go!

1000
00:59:41,452 --> 00:59:43,788
-You punk!
-All right!

1001
00:59:43,871 --> 00:59:46,457
We'll be going home now.

1002
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:47,417
-Wait!
-All right!

1003
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:48,334
Now, now!

1004
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:49,460
I told you!

1005
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:51,379
Anyone is free to go!

1006
00:59:51,462 --> 00:59:53,923
All right! This is not mandatory!

1007
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:55,008
Let's go!

1008
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:56,843
-Thank you! Have fun!
-Thank you!

1009
00:59:57,677 --> 01:00:01,139
Not mandatory!

1010
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:03,474
Let's go to round three!

1011
01:00:03,558 --> 01:00:04,601
Quickly!

1012
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:05,602
Okay, let's go.

1013
01:00:05,685 --> 01:00:07,937
-Ok-hui!
-Let's just go. It's okay.

1014
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:09,105
Ok-hui!

1015
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:14,944
Where is everyone?

1016
01:00:20,825 --> 01:00:22,994
What do you think you're doing?

1017
01:00:23,077 --> 01:00:24,245
Go home now.

1018
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:26,998
I didn't drink that much. What's with me?

1019
01:00:27,081 --> 01:00:28,916
It's almost time so just go.

1020
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,044
I'll figure it out. Don't worry about it.

1021
01:00:31,127 --> 01:00:32,462
Let's part ways here.

1022
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:35,673
You're out of time!

1023
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:37,884
You little punk.

1024
01:00:38,509 --> 01:00:41,179
How dare you speak
to an elder like that?

1025
01:00:41,262 --> 01:00:42,639
The sun will set soon.

1026
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:47,101
Do I need to spell it out?

1027
01:00:47,852 --> 01:00:48,936
What's going on?

1028
01:00:50,021 --> 01:00:52,357
Let's go somewhere quiet and talk.

1029
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:53,816
What's going on?

1030
01:00:56,986 --> 01:00:58,655
PROSECUTOR GYE JI-UNG

1031
01:00:59,405 --> 01:01:01,282
Let's not do this here. Let's go.

1032
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:03,326
It's him.

1033
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:10,375
If you suddenly end up fainting…

1034
01:01:17,882 --> 01:01:19,300
Not now…

1035
01:01:20,551 --> 01:01:21,469
Not yet…

1036
01:02:02,885 --> 01:02:05,012
Don't move or you might get caught.

1037
01:03:03,821 --> 01:03:06,741
MISS NIGHT AND DAY

1038
01:03:07,325 --> 01:03:08,785
How did you find out?

1039
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:13,289
Why do I think this situation
seems to have something to do with you?

1040
01:03:13,372 --> 01:03:14,332
Sun!

1041
01:03:16,459 --> 01:03:17,710
I can help you.

1042
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:18,753
Sold to the highest bid!

1043
01:03:18,836 --> 01:03:20,630
Transfer complete!

1044
01:03:20,713 --> 01:03:24,217
I think Ko Na-heun has gone missing.

1045
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:26,594
Mom!

1046
01:03:26,677 --> 01:03:27,678
By any chance,

1047
01:03:27,762 --> 01:03:29,680
have you seen me anywhere else?

1048
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:32,391
-What are you doing? Seriously.
-Excuse me.

1049
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:34,936
I just liked you from the start.

1050
01:03:35,019 --> 01:03:38,397
What happens if someone was
temporarily insane due to alcohol?

1051
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:46,113
