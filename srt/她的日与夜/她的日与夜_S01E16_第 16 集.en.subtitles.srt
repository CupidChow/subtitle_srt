1
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:45,962
MISS NIGHT AND DAY

2
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:51,468
You.

3
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:56,473
You…

4
00:00:58,808 --> 00:00:59,851
You're Sun, right?

5
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:03,063
Are you Sun?

6
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:03,980
Honey.

7
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,774
Wait a second, honey.

8
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:07,859
You're Sun, aren't you?

9
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:09,444
Right?

10
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:15,992
Sun.

11
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:18,286
You're her, aren't you?

12
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:20,789
Right, Sun?

13
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:23,500
See, honey! I told you Sun was alive.

14
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:26,169
She's standing right here alive.
She's not dead!

15
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:27,087
Sun.

16
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,547
Where have you been all this time?

17
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:32,592
Where were you?
You've been doing okay, right?

18
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:36,554
You came because you missed me,
but I didn't recognize you.

19
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:39,057
I kept kicking you out
and chasing you away.

20
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:39,974
I'm so sorry.

21
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:41,142
I'm sorry.

22
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:43,061
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.

23
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:44,354
I'm not Aunt Sun.

24
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,565
I'm Mi-jin.

25
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,652
What are you talking about?

26
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,988
What is it?
Are you mad I didn't recognize you?

27
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:55,448
I'm so sorry.

28
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:58,034
I'm really sorry.

29
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,869
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.

30
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:01,996
I'm sorry, Sun.

31
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,041
My goodness.

32
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,678
Sun.

33
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,139
I'm so sorry.

34
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:30,483
Dad.

35
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:45,748
Mi-jin?

36
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:46,916
What?

37
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:59,095
You…

38
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:02,807
Where did Sun go? What?

39
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,058
Where did Sun go?

40
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:08,605
Mi-jin? Where's your aunt?

41
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,273
Your aunt.

42
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:11,983
Where?

43
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:13,943
Mom.

44
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:17,363
She can't come back anymore.

45
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,198
You saw it too.

46
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:21,868
Aunt Sun…

47
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:23,953
Let's put her to rest.

48
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:27,874
It's the only way
she'll be able to find peace.

49
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:29,334
Okay?

50
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,795
But Mi-jin…

51
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,422
Why are you…

52
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:36,507
Why?

53
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:41,012
Honey?

54
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,223
Mi-jin, why?

55
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:45,558
Why?

56
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,769
Why is my girl like this?

57
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:50,146
Why?

58
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,815
Wait, what is this?

59
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:56,027
What happened to my daughter?

60
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:01,908
My goodness!

61
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,994
Heavenly Father!

62
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:16,381
SEOHAN DISTRICT COURT

63
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:18,967
The defendant has admitted guilt
and shown remorse.

64
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:22,428
He has cooperated with investigations,
served the community for years,

65
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:23,805
and is currently in poor health.

66
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:27,308
Taking the kidnapping victim's
request for leniency

67
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:28,977
and other factors into account,

68
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,063
we hereby sentence the defendant
to three years in prison.

69
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:40,822
I was wondering if she would,

70
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:43,032
but I guess Ms. Lee isn't coming.

71
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,705
She won't be able to.

72
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:52,083
But she'll be at Gong Gi-cheol's trial.

73
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:54,002
What?

74
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:56,629
You didn't know?
Ms. Tak summoned her as a witness.

75
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,720
She'll have to submit
a witness absence statement.

76
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:07,390
Why? I guess it would be hard
for her to attend?

77
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,726
She has a reason
why she can't come during the day.

78
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:11,936
Did you hear?

79
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:18,359
Lee Mi-jin's attending
Gong Gi-cheol's trial.

80
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:21,112
I was curious.

81
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:23,156
What's so special about her?

82
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:26,075
Why would the great Gye Ji-ung
go to such lengths to protect her?

83
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,628
Wait, what's going on?

84
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:51,142
I have to do whatever I can
to return to my original state.

85
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:53,644
For me

86
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:55,897
and for my mom and dad.

87
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,654
Still, just in case,

88
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,908
I have to prepare.

89
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:13,456
MY BUCKET LIST

90
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:14,665
Number one.

91
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,877
-Mom, get up.
-Okay.

92
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,629
Take Mom and Dad to the hospital.

93
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,339
-Have them get medical check-ups.
-Me?

94
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:23,466
-We'll go if you're ready.
-Okay.

95
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:26,969
Number two.

96
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,596
Abstain from drinking.

97
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:33,643
Allow for drinking only once a week.

98
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:38,898
Or twice a week?

99
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:41,109
Yeah, twice a week!

100
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:46,531
Okay, ladies. Have fun with it!

101
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:49,117
-Left, right!
-Number three. Join a gym.

102
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,202
-It's to prevent rapid aging.
-Left!

103
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:53,913
-Just a little.
-Okay, all the way. Let's go!

104
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:55,915
One, two, three, four!

105
00:06:58,584 --> 00:06:59,752
All right!

106
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:04,257
-See you next time!
-Great job!

107
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,967
Great work.

108
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:11,055
But what if I suddenly
get really old or sick?

109
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:14,725
What about my mom and dad?

110
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:18,521
Number four.

111
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,357
Take out an insurance policy.

112
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:23,860
Number five.

113
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:26,195
Just in case,

114
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,531
look into nursing homes.

115
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,783
Number six.

116
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,034
Do good deeds.

117
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:35,580
-There you go.
-Maybe volunteer to help abandoned cats?

118
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,707
I know it's a hassle,
but we have to clean our face.

119
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,250
Good kitty.

120
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:42,086
Look at your tail standing up!

121
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,379
Here's your food.

122
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,881
This cat looks just like me.

123
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,215
Look at its face.

124
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:47,884
It's you.

125
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,596
-Number seven.
-Careful, it'll burn!

126
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:54,724
Go on trips with my parents
while they're still healthy.

127
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,100
-That's hot!
-It's good!

128
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,143
Have some meat now.

129
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:59,562
-Sweet and salty!
-You'll rot your teeth!

130
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,397
-It's okay.
-Meat needs garlic.

131
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,815
It's so good.

132
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,109
One, two, three!

133
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,777
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

134
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,070
-Number eight.
-Okay.

135
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,323
-Take lots of pictures.
-One, two, three.

136
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,617
Kisses! One, two, three.

137
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,036
Do it to Mom! Okay. One, two, three.

138
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,454
Wow!

139
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:21,292
I'll deliver this.

140
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,210
-Number nine.
-Okay!

141
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:23,127
Bye, Dad.

142
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,129
-Find something I can do.
-I need meat for stew.

143
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:26,088
-For a stew?
-Yes.

144
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,007
Business? Cleaning?

145
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,008
Thank you.

146
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:30,343
Or take mom's job?

147
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:31,427
Yeah, I did it.

148
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,887
And run her butcher's shop?

149
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:35,973
Do two of these make 600 grams?

150
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,099
It's a bit more.

151
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,101
-Okay, I'll take these two.
-These two?

152
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:55,409
Do you know what's scarier
than studying again?

153
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:59,038
It's having to face another situation
where I have to give up.

154
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:02,166
That's why I want you to do
something you like.

155
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:04,585
Whatever that may be,

156
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,170
even if it's not studying,

157
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:08,464
I want you to do what you love

158
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,758
and feel excited instead of being scared.

159
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:18,516
Yeah, I should do
what I really want to do.

160
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,851
Number ten.

161
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,064
Do what I really want to do.

162
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,239
Mi-jin, come and eat…

163
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,759
MY BUCKET LIST

164
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:03,853
Goodness.

165
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:14,947
Mi-jin!

166
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:18,284
Get up.

167
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:19,535
What are you doing?

168
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,828
-Get up.
-But why?

169
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,121
We have somewhere to go.

170
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:23,789
-Go where?
-Come on!

171
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,249
Mom, what's wrong with you?

172
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,251
-Where are we going?
-I said come on!

173
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:28,919
Tell me first!

174
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:31,422
There's a skilled shaman
at the foot of Obongsan. Let's go.

175
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:34,133
Jeez, I've already tried it!

176
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,969
I tried everything!

177
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:41,057
Jeez! No matter what I do,
it doesn't work!

178
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,018
That shaman said,
"Show me, show me, show me."

179
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:46,437
But he didn't see anything
and couldn't fix me!

180
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,980
Skilled, my foot! I won't go.

181
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,358
So you're going to keep living like this?

182
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:52,109
You said you're getting older!

183
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,111
What if you become older than me?

184
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:56,113
How are you going to live then? How?

185
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,907
What do you think?

186
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:01,661
I'll just live with you two until I die.

187
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,913
Why would you die, you brat?

188
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:06,374
Is that why you wrote all that
in your notebook?

189
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:09,752
The things to do before you die.
What was it? A bucket list?

190
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,170
That's just…

191
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:14,632
I could just end up
continuing to live like this.

192
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:16,175
I just wanted to prepare.

193
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:18,594
Why on earth would you live like that?

194
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:22,306
I mean, what do you want me to do?

195
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,265
Goodness.

196
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,559
This is driving me crazy.

197
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:28,396
-Seriously.
-My goodness!

198
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:29,897
This is ridiculous.

199
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,690
I'll get wrinkles if I cry.

200
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,234
What?

201
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,903
Goodness, I can't believe this.

202
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,000
Put some on.

203
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:51,377
But this is Mom's.

204
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,795
It's okay. I bought it.

205
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,340
-Here too.
-Okay.

206
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:58,384
That is a bit better.

207
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:00,469
You're slowly getting
more premature gray hairs.

208
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,430
They're not premature. They are grey.

209
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,349
-They are?
-I should dye my hair, right?

210
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:06,350
I have some!

211
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:10,271
-It needs to help prevent hair loss too.
-What?

212
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:11,814
Is this all-natural?

213
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,107
Probably.

214
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:16,110
-Jeez, you need to get reading glasses.
-What?

215
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:18,446
Can I borrow these, Mom?

216
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,658
These are comfortable
once you get used to them.

217
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:24,994
It is all-natural.

218
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:25,911
Good grief.

219
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:28,080
It would've been nice if it was brighter.

220
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,415
I think it's just black.

221
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:30,624
Whatever.

222
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,501
Can you do this for me?

223
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:33,586
Okay.

224
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,255
-I'm good at it.
-Here.

225
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,508
-Ga-yeong.
-I have so many grays now.

226
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:40,426
Sun…

227
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:41,844
I've been through so much.

228
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,388
Mi-jin is driving me crazy.

229
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,390
-If you'd told me…
-Can you take her away?

230
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:48,476
-Come on!
-Just come with me!

231
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,561
-For crying out loud!
-Come on!

232
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:51,979
Why are we here?

233
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:55,524
The culprit has been caught,
but you didn't change back.

234
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,402
You could be old like this forever.
You need to take care of yourself.

235
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,197
I can't afford it. I'm leaving.

236
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,032
-Come on!
-What's with you?

237
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:05,784
It was a two-for-one deal.
I already had mine done.

238
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,661
How's my radiant and dewy skin?

239
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,792
Want to try? Just once?

240
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,669
Two-for-one? Let's go!

241
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:18,380
This is to make up
for the scar under your chin.

242
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:21,342
That machine can really get rid of it?

243
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:22,843
Jeez, just trust me.

244
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,346
-Hello!
-Hello.

245
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,850
Goodness, your daughter
must care about you so much.

246
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:32,186
She made the reservation
and brought you here herself.

247
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,438
I'm leaving.

248
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:36,065
My goodness.

249
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,066
Please do it fast.

250
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,609
Okay. Ma'am!

251
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:40,653
This doesn't hurt at all. Calm down.

252
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:42,738
So…

253
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,366
-Goodness!
-Mom.

254
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,878
I'll do what I can
to drag Mi-jin around all day,

255
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,588
so no need to worry.

256
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,760
-Wow!
-It's so bright!

257
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:06,845
You look ten years younger!

258
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,598
-Really?
-Yeah, it's so cool!

259
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:11,725
What do you think?

260
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,187
But I'm already 29.

261
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,481
What's great
about looking ten years younger?

262
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,901
Come on.

263
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:23,571
Everything's on me today.
Okay? Just leave it to me.

264
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:25,155
Come with me. Let's go.

265
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:28,075
Let's go! It's all on me!

266
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:29,785
-Which one? This?
-The first one.

267
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:32,329
Okay, it's ready.

268
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:33,289
-Look here.
-Okay.

269
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,373
One, two, three.

270
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,421
-What's that?
-Smile. One, two, three.

271
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,341
Hey, you wanted to do it!

272
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:46,218
Wait!

273
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:50,764
TAKE PHOTOS HERE

274
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,066
Lady.

275
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,067
I'm not a lady!

276
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,152
Are you kidding me, lady?

277
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,987
I was born in 1996!

278
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,071
More like 1969!

279
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,159
Why did you push me?

280
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,077
You want me to call the cops?

281
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,040
Should we go?

282
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:17,917
-Okay.
-What do you want to eat?

283
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,920
I know a great place.

284
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:27,718
I'm hungry now after all that fun.
I recently found an amazing restaurant.

285
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:29,511
What is it?

286
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:31,597
What?

287
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:33,307
You want pig's trotters?

288
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:38,479
Let's not go here.
No, let's get chicken instead.

289
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,566
Mr. Chu
On my lips, chu

290
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,568
Sweetly, chu

291
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:47,571
I lose all strength in my body

292
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:51,909
You shake up my heart
You shake me up

293
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:55,913
I'm falling, falling for your love

294
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:58,457
Hey, you
On my lips, chu

295
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,626
What is it? What are you doing? Let's go.

296
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,838
I found a great chicken place recently.

297
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:07,132
They don't use sugar,
so their food's not sweet.

298
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,303
I told you everything was on me today.

299
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,055
This is the best part.

300
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:15,224
Can we not go in here?

301
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,560
Why not? This place is good!

302
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,313
You don't want to go?

303
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,524
Come on, let's go.

304
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:28,570
Damn.

305
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,156
You can have both drumsticks.

306
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:39,206
-Enjoy.
-It looks so good!

307
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:40,332
Eat up.

308
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:43,460
It looks so good.

309
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,006
No!

310
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,144
Babe!

311
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:19,997
Right.

312
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:28,130
What? I gave you both drumsticks.
Why are you so depressed?

313
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:30,966
To be honest,

314
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:33,802
I once came here when I was working.

315
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,098
I see. Damn it.

316
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:40,434
I picked the wrong place.

317
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,314
I didn't really know it back then.

318
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:47,441
Know what?

319
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:49,485
I didn't know

320
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,528
just how much

321
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:55,991
I liked that job.

322
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:58,535
But you know what?

323
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,623
I only realized after it was gone.

324
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,794
It's just like my youth.

325
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,801
What on earth?
Since when did you become an old soul?

326
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,886
Did you age emotionally too?

327
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:24,353
Thanks to you,

328
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:28,190
I know what I want to do now.

329
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:30,192
What is it?

330
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:37,324
It's good.

331
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:38,492
What is it?

332
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,037
You're not going to tell me?

333
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:44,832
Then, give this back. Okay.

334
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,555
Goodness, he's back again.

335
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:45,392
Why does he look so thin?

336
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:47,311
That handsome face is wasting away.

337
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,897
-Stay here.
-What?

338
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:54,693
Go give this to him.

339
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,905
Tell him not to skip his meals.

340
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,156
-All right.
-Okay.

341
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:11,627
You don't have to visit.

342
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,672
I couldn't even if I wanted to.
I've been called up to Seoul.

343
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,717
Really? That's great.

344
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,676
Yes.

345
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,554
-Thank you for everything.
-Gosh, I didn't do anything.

346
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:23,555
-Take this.
-No.

347
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:24,640
-You don't have to.
-Stop.

348
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,391
You'll upset her. Just take it.

349
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:29,811
Please thank her for me.

350
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:30,729
Okay.

351
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:34,566
I'm almost home now.

352
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,402
I'll get going now.

353
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:39,571
-Mr. Gye!
-Yes?

354
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,659
Gosh, there are so many stars out tonight.

355
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:51,917
What's he looking at?

356
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:57,839
You know, the plum wine we made
fermented really well.

357
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,049
How about a glass?

358
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:00,676
I drove here.

359
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:04,888
-I'll go now--
-Wait!

360
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:08,934
There was something I wanted to tell you
one last time. Will you hear me out?

361
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:12,771
-Sure.
-The thing is you're always so busy.

362
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:14,815
I bet you can't work out much.

363
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:17,025
I want to teach you some stretches.

364
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:20,070
Try this. Follow me.
Put that down and try.

365
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,074
-Follow me.
-Okay.

366
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:28,704
To the left too.

367
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:33,208
Goodness, you're so stiff.

368
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,419
Grab my shoulders and press down.

369
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:39,256
Press harder!

370
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,174
Are you okay?

371
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:43,844
You're good. Should we try this too?

372
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:45,804
Now, stretch.

373
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:47,389
You have to pull too.

374
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:48,598
Okay.

375
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:50,392
Are you okay?

376
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:53,145
What are they doing?
Why are they exercising at night?

377
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:55,063
I don't believe this.

378
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:11,413
You must work out.

379
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:12,622
Yes, in my spare time.

380
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,293
Okay, then.

381
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:17,377
Right.

382
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:19,713
I'll be on my way now.

383
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:22,049
Wait… Well…

384
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,596
-Take care of yourself.
-I will, sir.

385
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,222
Goodbye.

386
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:32,184
Hey, drive safely.

387
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:33,852
-Okay.
-Yeah.

388
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,773
Is Mr. Gye leaving?

389
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,252
Damn it!

390
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:01,922
Goodness.

391
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:05,967
Dad, Mom!

392
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:09,763
What took you so long?
You said you'd come ages ago!

393
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:11,056
Stop it.

394
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:11,973
Jeez.

395
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:15,435
What's with him?

396
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,229
You should've come earlier, you brat.

397
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:21,566
But is it something
to get that angry about?

398
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:22,734
I don't know!

399
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:28,782
Jeez.

400
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,429
I'll be on my way now.

401
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:53,640
Hey, drive safely.

402
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:54,975
Hey…

403
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,102
Don't forget about me.

404
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:58,854
-Okay.
-All right.

405
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:30,552
Come on.

406
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:32,679
Let's go.

407
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:34,014
Let's do what needs to be done.

408
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:37,726
Do what needs to be done. I'll do that.

409
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:44,566
ADMINISTRATIVE LAW

410
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:47,152
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW

411
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:56,745
SEOHAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

412
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:09,883
It's so…

413
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:11,426
expensive.

414
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,184
LOCAL DEALS
SECONDHAND

415
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:22,812
You're not buying
secondhand couple rings, are you?

416
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:25,899
Rings from couples who break up
before three months are practically new.

417
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:29,236
But still, how could you buy
secondhand rings?

418
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:31,404
You know my current financial situation.

419
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:33,823
Then, get ones within your budget.

420
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:35,742
Why go overboard and get scammed again?

421
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:38,036
Then, to make up for that,
you'll be scammed again.

422
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:39,621
What's wrong with secondhand rings?

423
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:41,915
If you look carefully,
new and unopened ones suddenly…

424
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:43,291
Holy cow!

425
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:51,675
WEDDING RINGS IMPORTED FROM US
800,000 WON

426
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:00,642
If you buy this,
you're hitting the jackpot.

427
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:07,774
A Cartier at this price
is pretty much a steal.

428
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:08,858
They're practically new.

429
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:11,194
They're not "practically new."
They are new.

430
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:12,737
How long were they worn for?

431
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:15,907
Honestly, they were never worn.
We broke up on the first day.

432
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:17,742
-I might jinx it.
-But we got back together.

433
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,160
You should wear them then.

434
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:22,122
My business became really successful
after we got back together.

435
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:24,666
So I got
four-carat diamond rings instead.

436
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:25,959
Really sparkly, right?

437
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:27,252
Wow.

438
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:29,004
That's absolutely incredible.

439
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:30,463
I see.

440
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:33,383
But if you look at them closely,

441
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:35,593
I see some fine scratches.

442
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:39,889
Where? I can't see them.

443
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:42,600
No, right there.
It's about 0.2 millimeters long.

444
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:45,437
-I'll give you a discount then.
-Yes, of course.

445
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,314
-How much?
-Okay, I'll take 5,000 won off.

446
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:48,273
That's all?

447
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:50,608
Plus another 5,000 won,
so a 10,000-won discount.

448
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:53,028
Thank you. I'll transfer the money now.

449
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:54,237
-Quickly.
-Okay.

450
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:57,949
I knew this would happen.

451
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,076
Mr. Gye.

452
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,161
Long time no see.

453
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,039
What are you doing here, sir?

454
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,623
I should ask the same for you.

455
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,335
Where do you think you're going?

456
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:09,419
My hair. Wait.

457
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:11,588
-You'll pull it out.
-Come peacefully.

458
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:17,761
Last time was our first meeting,
so it took ten minutes.

459
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:20,305
Since we're already familiar,
let's make it quick. Get up.

460
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:21,890
I can't believe this!

461
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:23,892
Was this an undercover operation?

462
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:25,977
What's going on? Do you know him?

463
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:28,605
He has seven prior fraud convictions…
Wait, is it eight now?

464
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:29,522
Gosh, I'm dying.

465
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:31,566
How could someone like him
get out so fast?

466
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:33,693
Fraud?

467
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:35,570
Fraud?

468
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:37,072
Fraud? You punk!

469
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:39,491
-Fraud?
-Jeez, come on.

470
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:40,700
-Goodness.
-You punk!

471
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:41,785
Hey, you punk!

472
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:44,579
I could sue for assault, you know.

473
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:45,914
How dare you scam me?

474
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,332
Hello, Detective Kwon.

475
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:49,667
I caught a perp on scene.
Can you pick him up?

476
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:54,631
Come here!

477
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:04,432
Get over here!

478
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:14,943
Hey! Come here!

479
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:18,780
I got you! Come here!

480
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:37,507
Just don't do anything from now on.

481
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,342
How do you get scammed so often?

482
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,471
I'm not bad for being scammed.
It's the fraud who's bad.

483
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:46,307
If you were scammed once,
you should be more careful.

484
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,518
Why would you dive
straight into a mess like that?

485
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:50,520
It was clearly a scam.
How do you fall for that?

486
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:51,980
For goodness' sake.

487
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:55,984
Pull over by the station over there.

488
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:58,445
Why? Are you going to stay
at a bathhouse again?

489
00:28:58,528 --> 00:28:59,571
Why would you care?

490
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:03,116
Here.

491
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:06,578
What's this?

492
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,496
I mean, it's not much.

493
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,957
GIFT CERTIFICATE
HANDONG

494
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:13,918
Mr. Gye!

495
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:16,045
Mr. Gye, I love you!

496
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:17,297
-I love you!
-Get off!

497
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,465
I said I love you!

498
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:20,175
Go away! It's too hot for this.

499
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:23,011
Wow.

500
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:24,888
It's a farewell gift.

501
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:31,144
What do you mean "farewell"?

502
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:35,440
Farewell? What are you talking about?

503
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:40,361
Did you think if you gave me this,
I'd happily say goodbye? Did you?

504
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,822
Where are you going without me? Where?

505
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:44,449
How was it?

506
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:45,617
This is great.

507
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,660
-So pretty. Okay.
-Take it like this.

508
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:50,371
You didn't discuss it with me at all,
so tell me now.

509
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,207
Where are you going? You can tell me!

510
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:54,834
Tell me! This is so frustrating!

511
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:57,337
Where are you going without me?

512
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,506
Why? Why are you leaving?

513
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:02,967
Don't go! Please, don't go!
I'm right here!

514
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,059
Seriously.

515
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:12,477
What do you think?

516
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,645
Hey!

517
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:22,779
I hated being young.

518
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:27,700
People think you can
do anything if you're young,

519
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:29,911
but there are so many things you can't do.

520
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:34,332
I would've rather given up my youth.

521
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:38,461
But it wasn't until after I'd lost it

522
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:40,213
that I realized.

523
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,092
My youth was a gift.

524
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:48,429
The time we take for granted

525
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:51,558
never lasts forever.

526
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:04,946
This came out well too.

527
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:06,155
Look at this.

528
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:08,324
How's this?

529
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:09,450
-This is good.
-It's great.

530
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:10,535
Right?

531
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:39,939
What?

532
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:46,529
I'm leaving.

533
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:00,627
You're leaving now?

534
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:02,670
Yeah.

535
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:06,090
I feel so strange.

536
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:08,635
I thought I'd be happy.

537
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,721
Didn't you want me gone?

538
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:13,848
I did, but…

539
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:17,727
I'm kind of at a loss
of what to do without you now.

540
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:23,650
Just do what you've been doing.

541
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:26,945
You made everything I did happen.

542
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:32,992
I was able to do it because of you.

543
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,913
I could've never done it on my own.

544
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:39,624
You know,

545
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:41,918
I understand how you feel.

546
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:43,753
But you're wrong.

547
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:48,633
You were able to do it because it was you.

548
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:52,887
Only you could've done it.

549
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:56,474
You're me.

550
00:32:58,267 --> 00:33:00,061
You were a gift to me.

551
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,442
But the thing is…

552
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,278
you always had that gift.

553
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:13,950
You just realized it a little late.

554
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:22,000
You know, being old…

555
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:24,293
was really sad.

556
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:29,424
Work as much as you can.

557
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,844
Have fun and meet lots of people.

558
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:35,722
You can fall in love too.

559
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:39,017
But it'd be so nice to do it
when you're younger.

560
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:41,102
That's what I think.

561
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:43,855
You're young.

562
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:47,108
You should do
everything you want to do in life, right?

563
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,445
Do you think

564
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:53,573
I can be brave again

565
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:57,035
without you?

566
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:02,415
You already are.

567
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:15,511
I'll go now.

568
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:26,606
Goodbye.

569
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:26,999
Your move isn't for a while.

570
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:28,459
But you're packing already?

571
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:33,965
It seems like you wish I'd leave sooner.

572
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:35,508
Of course not.

573
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:39,679
Your eyes look sad, but you're smiling.

574
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:42,181
That's a misunderstanding.

575
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:43,850
Yeah, right.

576
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:47,353
I'll be living here
until the end of your contract,

577
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:48,646
so I'm very grateful,

578
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:51,065
and I feel at ease moving in.

579
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:53,109
But you're really just going to leave?

580
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:55,820
It was a sudden transfer.
I had no choice. The case is over too.

581
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:57,572
No, not that.

582
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:04,871
Just let me know how she's doing.
Ask Ga-yeong about her.

583
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:13,588
You took good care of it.

584
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,222
We will begin witness examinations.

585
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:24,807
Witness, please step forward.

586
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:26,976
SEOHAN CITY SERIAL MURDER CASE

587
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:28,060
DEFENDANT

588
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:36,319
Is the witness not here yet?

589
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:39,488
The witness will be here.

590
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:41,282
Please give her a bit more time.

591
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:46,996
If the witness cannot attend…

592
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:26,202
At the abandoned house where the defendant
imprisoned Lee Mi-jin, we found…

593
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:30,373
drugs made from poppy extract,

594
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:33,000
the weapon used to commit the crimes,

595
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,043
and…

596
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,798
the victims' remains.

597
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:40,758
The prosecution rests.

598
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:45,972
WITNESS STAND

599
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:49,475
Does the defense have
any additional questions for the witness?

600
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:53,271
I didn't intend to kill them.

601
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:57,525
They brought about their own deaths.

602
00:37:58,192 --> 00:38:00,778
I said I just happened to kill them.

603
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:06,033
The statute of limitations
for the murder of my aunt…

604
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:10,162
and the other victims have expired.

605
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:13,082
But the pain
that families have felt for years,

606
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:17,169
not knowing the fate of their loved ones
who suddenly disappeared, still remains.

607
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:20,172
Your Honor,

608
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:24,510
as a relative of the victim

609
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:28,472
and as a victim
who was almost killed by the defendant,

610
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:31,392
I hope the defendant
will be severely punished.

611
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,720
-Stop looking for him.
-What?

612
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:10,681
You keep looking around
for Mr. Gye in case he shows up.

613
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:16,687
I guess Mr. Ju isn't here yet.

614
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:18,898
Yeah, because it's not his case.

615
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:20,608
Right.

616
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:23,027
He's very busy too.

617
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,282
It's about Mr. Gye.

618
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:30,493
He's going back to Seoul.

619
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:34,288
Hey, they're starting.

620
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:37,708
All rise.

621
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:49,595
Verdict for criminal case number 2024-317.

622
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:52,973
On October 15, 2024,

623
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:56,143
the defendant brutally killed
the victim Na Ok-hui

624
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,354
by striking her several times with an axe.

625
00:39:58,437 --> 00:40:01,273
In addition, the defendant
murdered a witness to this crime,

626
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:03,859
the victim Ko Na-heun
by severing his ankle

627
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:06,028
and throwing him into a reservoir.

628
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:11,784
Past crimes cannot be punished
due to expired statute of limitations.

629
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:13,911
But the murders of Na Ok-hui
and Ko Na-heun,

630
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:16,372
the kidnapping
and imprisonment of Lee Hak-chan,

631
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:19,166
and the kidnapping, imprisonment,
and attempted murder of Lee Mi-jin

632
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:22,628
are inhumane crimes
that cannot be tolerated.

633
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:26,507
Despite this, the defendant shows
no remorse for her crimes

634
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:29,552
and was deemed to be
a high risk of reoffending.

635
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:34,348
Above all, the victims and their families
have requested severe punishment.

636
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:38,018
Therefore, the defendant
must be permanently removed from society.

637
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:42,064
The court sentences
the defendant to death.

638
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:48,362
All rise.

639
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,405
Death?

640
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:53,033
I'm going to appeal!

641
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,285
You bastards!

642
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:56,162
I'll sue you all!

643
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:58,789
Let go! Let go of me.

644
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:03,085
You damn beast!

645
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:07,548
You call yourself a human being?

646
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:09,383
You killed my sister

647
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,635
and tried to kill my daughter too?

648
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:15,097
Death is too good for you

649
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:16,640
and Hell wouldn't be enough.

650
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:18,142
You damn devil.

651
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:20,978
You better wait in Hell for me.

652
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:23,314
I'm going to chase you down,

653
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:27,193
and I'll tear you to pieces!

654
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:28,652
See you in Hell.

655
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:34,492
You'll never be forgiven even in death!

656
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:43,501
Sun!

657
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:44,460
My poor sister!

658
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:46,337
Sun!

659
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,630
Mom.

660
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:55,638
Ms. Lim left, and you're leaving too.

661
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:58,307
I'll be all alone here.

662
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:00,476
I'll make a recommendation
for you when I get there.

663
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:02,937
Why would you do that?

664
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:05,773
Mr. Gye.

665
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:11,278
You did a great job.

666
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:12,863
Thank you, sir.

667
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:15,783
Hearing that you're leaving
is so refreshing. I mean…

668
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:18,160
It's sad.

669
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:23,165
For a talented prosecutor like Gye Ji-ung,
he belongs in the big leagues, not here.

670
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:24,625
For sure.

671
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:26,293
I'll get going.

672
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:28,462
All right.

673
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:30,172
Good work.

674
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:33,842
No need to see me out.

675
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:43,394
PROSECUTOR GYE JI-UNG

676
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:41,452
Gosh, that's good!

677
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:42,369
Here.

678
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:43,579
-It tastes so good.
-Nice!

679
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:44,955
-I brought more. Eat up.
-Wow!

680
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:46,415
Thank you for the food.

681
00:43:46,498 --> 00:43:47,458
It's good.

682
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,918
-By the way, Mi-jin.
-Yes?

683
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:53,881
I hear you're quitting
your environmental public service job.

684
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:55,758
What are you going to do now?

685
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:01,305
Dad, do you want to be dragged out again?

686
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:04,016
-Eat up.
-I mean…

687
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:07,728
What if she tries to prepare
for the civil service exam again?

688
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:09,688
I just said it since I was worried.

689
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:13,609
I am going to start again.

690
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:15,861
Start what?

691
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:17,237
Studying for exams.

692
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:27,289
So you've been going out every night
to study for the civil service exams?

693
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:30,376
I was going to tell you after I'd passed.

694
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:33,295
But I don't know when that'll be.

695
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:36,006
Are you crazy?

696
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:38,300
I'm sick of hearing about civil servants.

697
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:41,637
-Don't even dream of it.
-You wanted me to be a civil servant.

698
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:45,391
But what I'm studying for
is what I really want to be.

699
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:49,228
There's something I really want to do.

700
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,148
That's why I want to start again

701
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:54,942
and do it properly.

702
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:57,111
Even if I fail, I won't regret it.

703
00:44:58,237 --> 00:44:59,071
Okay?

704
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:03,909
Goodness.

705
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:17,047
Cheers!

706
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:18,966
Okay!

707
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:20,968
Yeah, cheers!

708
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:22,761
What's with you all?

709
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:23,679
Come on, Mom!

710
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:25,097
Don't be like that.

711
00:45:25,764 --> 00:45:27,474
We're missing someone's glass.

712
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,977
Jeez. Whatever. I don't care anymore.

713
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:30,936
Jeez!

714
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:33,647
-Good luck!
-Good luck, Mi-jin!

715
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,570
-How refreshing!
-It's so good!

716
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:41,488
-I'll do my best.
-You better, you brat.

717
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:42,906
Don't worry, okay?

718
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:45,325
-Take some meat when you go.
-Mom, wrap this for me.

719
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:47,244
Don't be ridiculous!

720
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:49,746
But your shop gave away pork shoulder!

721
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:53,333
-Jeez! You're drunk!
-Gosh, be quiet!

722
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:57,379
-I think your dad needs to go home.
-Dad.

723
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:58,380
Come on, Dad.

724
00:45:58,464 --> 00:46:00,340
I've already had three shots.

725
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:28,262
SEOHAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

726
00:47:28,845 --> 00:47:30,681
Okay, you may now begin your work.

727
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:33,100
If you have questions, ask your superiors.

728
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:35,769
Good luck.

729
00:47:35,852 --> 00:47:38,105
-Have a nice day, ma'am.
-Have a good day.

730
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:41,316
Let's see here.

731
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,443
It looks like everyone's in uniform.

732
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:45,028
-So follow me.
-Okay.

733
00:47:45,779 --> 00:47:48,782
I heard a legendary intern
used to be here.

734
00:47:48,865 --> 00:47:51,076
Yes, there was!

735
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:52,619
The legendary intern!

736
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:55,163
-Her name was Lim Sun.
-That's right.

737
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:57,916
-Really?
-She was amazing.

738
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,751
She threw herself into harm's way!

739
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:01,086
She stopped a terrorist attack!

740
00:48:01,169 --> 00:48:04,214
-A terrorist attack?
-She helped catch a serial killer too.

741
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:06,883
-The rumors were true.
-Stop exaggerating.

742
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:07,843
What?

743
00:48:07,926 --> 00:48:09,344
Are you writing a biography?

744
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:12,764
I'm saying there's a reason why
the term "Senior Avengers" exists.

745
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:14,891
Where is she now though?

746
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:15,851
I don't know.

747
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:17,477
I want to know too.

748
00:48:18,854 --> 00:48:20,606
I wonder where she is
and what she's doing.

749
00:48:22,357 --> 00:48:24,610
Before resuming activities
after your military service,

750
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:27,362
we wanted to know why
you're releasing a single album first.

751
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:32,784
I wanted to communicate through my music
rather than show my appearance.

752
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:35,412
I took such a long break,

753
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:37,080
so I was itching to work again.

754
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:40,626
Your fans are especially interested
in the first track.

755
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:43,420
They want to know if it's based
on a real romantic experience?

756
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:45,672
The lyrics are so poignant.

757
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:47,591
Ko Won,

758
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:53,138
having someone as remarkable as you
be my friend and supporter

759
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:55,641
reassured me so much.

760
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:02,856
But things aren't over between him and me.

761
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:09,154
I'm trying really hard
to be close to him again.

762
00:49:11,573 --> 00:49:12,407
Well…

763
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:14,868
I have no comment on that.

764
00:49:18,955 --> 00:49:20,332
I'll keep your secret.

765
00:49:20,415 --> 00:49:21,458
Ma'am…

766
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:23,085
You kept my secret too.

767
00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:25,420
You know too many vitamins
can make you sick too, right?

768
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:28,465
I'll get you an iced coffee
every morning. Deal?

769
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:29,549
That's cold!

770
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:31,968
Everything you say is so typical…

771
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:35,013
but it's nice.

772
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:37,849
Thanks for being Ko Won's fan.

773
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:40,102
And I hope you continue to support him.

774
00:49:44,606 --> 00:49:46,274
It's a precious memory

775
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:49,319
I want to keep to myself.

776
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:08,338
Wow!

777
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:09,548
It looks so good.

778
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:13,051
If it's for you, I can do anything.

779
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:16,430
But is today a special day?

780
00:50:17,055 --> 00:50:21,184
I tried so hard to think,
but I have no idea what this day is.

781
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:23,478
To be honest, today…

782
00:50:26,022 --> 00:50:28,525
I'm celebrating
the early repayment of my loan.

783
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:31,528
So you… paid off all of your debts?

784
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:33,280
Yes, finally.

785
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:36,199
You've worked so hard for that.
Congratulations!

786
00:50:38,243 --> 00:50:41,872
So to celebrate the early repayment,
I've prepared something.

787
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:43,582
-What is it?
-Wait just a moment.

788
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:45,625
Let's see.

789
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:46,668
Where was it again?

790
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:47,836
What is it?

791
00:50:47,919 --> 00:50:49,087
What's wrong?

792
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:50,255
Where is it?

793
00:50:50,964 --> 00:50:51,798
What?

794
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:00,098
What's this?

795
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:10,442
What? What's wrong?

796
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:11,985
What are you doing?

797
00:51:23,538 --> 00:51:26,374
Ga-yeong, please accept this.

798
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:36,510
I can't take it.

799
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:38,804
I see…

800
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:41,431
-It's okay.
-So help me put it on.

801
00:51:43,016 --> 00:51:44,100
Do it for me.

802
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:03,662
Wow.

803
00:52:06,581 --> 00:52:07,582
It's so pretty.

804
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:10,043
You're even prettier.

805
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:15,882
-Can I take a picture?
-Yes.

806
00:52:29,437 --> 00:52:31,523
How's Mi-jin? Is she doing well?

807
00:52:31,606 --> 00:52:32,440
Yes.

808
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:34,818
She's preparing
for the third round of exams.

809
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:35,819
Already?

810
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:39,656
Wow, that's incredible.
She passed the first two rounds in one go.

811
00:52:39,739 --> 00:52:41,116
But I'm a little worried.

812
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:44,452
She always does well and then slips.

813
00:52:45,161 --> 00:52:46,121
How?

814
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:49,124
On the day before her Grade 7
civil service exam, her appendix burst.

815
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:52,794
She had a car accident the next year,
so she couldn't make it.

816
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:56,089
Everything,
from shingles to kidney stones.

817
00:52:57,382 --> 00:52:59,217
They're all actually stress-related.

818
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:01,761
It's the pressure of having to pass

819
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:04,764
and a type of mental anxiety.

820
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:11,104
But who knows this time?

821
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:13,815
She has a clear goal now.

822
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:15,775
A goal?

823
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:17,444
Well…

824
00:53:20,071 --> 00:53:22,741
How's Mr. Gye doing?

825
00:53:22,824 --> 00:53:23,783
I see.

826
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:26,411
Yes, he's the same as always.

827
00:53:26,494 --> 00:53:28,747
They looked so good together.

828
00:53:29,497 --> 00:53:30,498
Just like us.

829
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:33,710
Gosh.

830
00:53:33,793 --> 00:53:34,669
Stop it.

831
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:41,259
SIX MONTHS LATER

832
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:58,693
You don't feel it?

833
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:01,071
-Feel what?
-Where was it?

834
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:02,864
Seohan? Seohyang?

835
00:54:02,948 --> 00:54:04,491
-Seohan District?
-Yeah, that's it.

836
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:07,827
Since returning, you've been persistently
poking your nose in everything.

837
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:09,454
Working hard at my job is a problem?

838
00:54:09,537 --> 00:54:12,082
No, doing it needlessly well is a problem.

839
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:14,000
Don't overdo it.

840
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:16,628
If it's not for personal gain,
you'll be called a sociopath.

841
00:54:22,884 --> 00:54:23,802
Hey, they're here.

842
00:54:24,302 --> 00:54:25,679
This year's top investigator hire.

843
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:31,559
A new Grade 7 recruit
was assigned to my office.

844
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:33,186
She's totally my type.

845
00:54:33,269 --> 00:54:34,938
A woman with a sexy mind.

846
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:37,357
She wrote a statement in five minutes

847
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:41,444
and organized supplies and receipts
in Excel sheets as soon as she came in.

848
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:42,821
It's like she's done it before.

849
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:48,994
It's all done.

850
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:52,288
I'll make a formula that will manage
the supplies efficiently.

851
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:55,166
There's someone else who's that good?

852
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:56,459
Yeah.

853
00:55:00,213 --> 00:55:01,297
Are there seats?

854
00:55:02,215 --> 00:55:03,717
It's the prosecutor I called dibs on.

855
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:04,718
Incredible, right?

856
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:11,808
Ms. Lee, over here.

857
00:55:11,891 --> 00:55:12,934
Okay.

858
00:55:14,185 --> 00:55:15,854
Hello.

859
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:41,796
Take a seat.

860
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:43,214
Okay.

861
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:00,065
She's incredible.

862
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:03,193
We studied together before,
and she was hired as a recruit.

863
00:56:03,276 --> 00:56:05,278
She bombed the Grade 9 exam back then.

864
00:56:05,361 --> 00:56:06,738
What are you talking about?

865
00:56:07,572 --> 00:56:09,991
But I'd say that created an opportunity.

866
00:56:10,742 --> 00:56:11,993
Yeah, it did.

867
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:14,662
What are you doing this weekend?

868
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:17,207
I have tickets to the Coolplay concert.

869
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:18,625
How did you get those?

870
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:19,876
I really wanted to go.

871
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:21,669
Can you sell them to me?

872
00:56:22,962 --> 00:56:23,797
Want to go with me?

873
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:26,424
No, I have plans.

874
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:27,759
What plans?

875
00:56:27,842 --> 00:56:29,594
I'm seeing someone I like.

876
00:56:32,263 --> 00:56:33,765
Do you have a girlfriend?

877
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:37,185
Do you have a boyfriend?

878
00:56:41,523 --> 00:56:42,357
Me?

879
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:55,829
PROSECUTOR YOON BAK

880
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:04,003
By any chance, do you like pasta?

881
00:57:05,171 --> 00:57:08,174
Let's end work early today
and go to the new pasta place nearby.

882
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:11,970
I usually try to avoid working late.

883
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:16,057
How is eating dinner
the same as working late?

884
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:17,392
That hurts my feelings.

885
00:57:26,025 --> 00:57:28,653
I bought the concert tickets.
Want to go with me?

886
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:32,824
I usually try to avoid
working on weekends.

887
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:34,826
You're so funny.

888
00:57:34,909 --> 00:57:36,161
Working on weekends?

889
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:37,912
I'm asking you out on a date.

890
00:57:39,205 --> 00:57:42,000
I usually try to avoid dating coworkers.

891
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:45,503
Then, what am I supposed to do?

892
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:48,590
I usually don't pay premiums
on concert tickets,

893
00:57:48,673 --> 00:57:50,008
but I made an exception--

894
00:57:50,091 --> 00:57:52,886
You didn't really pay a premium, did you?

895
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:56,097
Is one of our nation's prosecutors
violating the Minor Offenses Act?

896
00:57:56,181 --> 00:57:57,599
And did I just witness that?

897
00:57:58,516 --> 00:58:00,435
I can't report a colleague though.

898
00:58:00,518 --> 00:58:02,228
-What should I do?
-Stop it.

899
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:05,315
You should be leading by example,
not scalping tickets.

900
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:08,193
Our department head will…
Wait, was that the reason?

901
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:09,402
He asked for you.

902
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:10,487
-You should go.
-Hey!

903
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:12,489
Why are you telling me this now? Jeez!

904
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:16,159
Because I just got here.

905
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:18,828
What's Coolplay anyway?

906
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:31,508
Did you need something?

907
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:36,137
No, not really.

908
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:39,015
I was curious about something.

909
00:58:39,098 --> 00:58:40,767
Why do you hate dating coworkers?

910
00:58:42,435 --> 00:58:44,103
I never said I hated it.

911
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:46,648
You just said you hated dating coworkers.

912
00:58:46,731 --> 00:58:49,859
Yes, because he asked me,

913
00:58:49,943 --> 00:58:52,195
but it depends on who is asking.

914
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:54,614
Right?

915
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:57,867
So you were just turning him down, right?

916
00:58:58,451 --> 00:58:59,494
I mean…

917
00:58:59,577 --> 00:59:01,079
To be honest,

918
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,206
it's been so long…

919
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:08,253
-My gosh!
-My hand!

920
00:59:08,336 --> 00:59:10,547
Why would you touch that?

921
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:16,135
-Does it really hurt?
-Yes.

922
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:17,720
-Should I stop?
-No, it's fine.

923
00:59:18,471 --> 00:59:20,390
Gosh, what if this leaves a scar?

924
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:23,434
Why did you pretend
to not know me back there?

925
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:26,563
Because you did it first.

926
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:34,279
It's not because you have a boyfriend
and felt uncomfortable, is it?

927
00:59:34,362 --> 00:59:35,947
I said I had a boyfriend?

928
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:37,115
You didn't say you didn't.

929
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:42,996
But you said there's someone you like.

930
00:59:43,955 --> 00:59:44,831
I do.

931
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:49,377
She's right in front of me.

932
00:59:57,594 --> 00:59:59,220
-I don't have one.
-What?

933
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:02,432
I don't have a boyfriend.

934
01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:09,522
People will look!
What if someone sees us?

935
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:11,316
Who cares? No one's around.

936
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:16,779
Do you know how hard it's been for me?

937
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:20,408
Do you know how long I waited?

938
01:00:22,076 --> 01:00:23,536
I missed you so much.

939
01:00:24,662 --> 01:00:25,705
I really did.

940
01:00:54,942 --> 01:00:57,570
Tomorrow's Saturday.
Should we go on a date at night?

941
01:00:58,154 --> 01:00:59,447
Why at night?

942
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:00,990
We can't meet during the day.

943
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:03,201
It's daytime right now.

944
01:01:03,284 --> 01:01:05,745
-You're right!
-What's with you?

945
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:07,121
What happened?

946
01:01:07,205 --> 01:01:09,290
We can see each other during the day now?

947
01:01:09,374 --> 01:01:10,625
It just happened.

948
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:13,127
But how? All of a sudden?

949
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:15,463
I know. It was sudden.

950
01:01:16,464 --> 01:01:18,174
For no reason at all?

951
01:01:19,634 --> 01:01:21,010
Mr. Gye!

952
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:44,492
What was that?

953
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:46,160
Did you hear that?

954
01:01:48,871 --> 01:01:50,873
No, I didn't hear anything.

955
01:01:50,957 --> 01:01:52,458
What did you hear?

956
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:54,335
It looks like you heard something too.

957
01:01:54,419 --> 01:01:55,670
I didn't hear anything.

958
01:01:55,753 --> 01:01:58,548
-Are you okay? Are you hearing things?
-How strange.

959
01:02:02,635 --> 01:02:04,595
Gosh, the weather's so nice.

960
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:05,680
It really is nice.

961
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:08,057
What's nice?

962
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:35,084
MISS NIGHT AND DAY

963
01:02:56,939 --> 01:02:58,816
SPECIAL THANKS TO YOON BAK

964
01:03:32,391 --> 01:03:37,021
