1
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:45,962
MISS NIGHT AND DAY

2
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:52,385
Do you know how precious that job is
for those who live hand-to-mouth?

3
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,012
I swear.

4
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:55,930
But that person was hired!

5
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:59,934
At our age, we all know
how unfair the world is.

6
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:01,561
It'd be odd if it were fair.

7
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,607
The thing is I definitely recognized them,

8
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:06,900
but they were someone else.

9
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:10,195
A different person?

10
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:11,780
It's unfair that I wasn't hired,

11
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:15,033
but seeing a fraud get the job
was too much to bear!

12
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:16,326
That's why I sent the letter!

13
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,620
Wait. Then, who is this person?

14
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:20,789
Where did I put it?

15
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:23,166
Gosh, here it is.

16
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,126
Here.

17
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,003
SEOHAN NEWS

18
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,131
What?

19
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:31,382
Na Ok-hui?

20
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:32,300
Who?

21
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:35,053
She isn't Na Ok-hui.

22
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:41,684
Goodness, I'm so nervous.

23
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:42,602
Really?

24
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:44,562
You poor thing.

25
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:46,356
What if I don't get it?

26
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,816
-I'm at my interview.
-Don't worry.

27
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:49,234
I have nowhere else to go.

28
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:50,276
NA OK-HUI

29
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,986
Don't worry. It'll work out.

30
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:53,905
-Ok-hui.
-Yeah?

31
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:54,948
Aren't you nervous?

32
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:58,326
Not really.

33
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:01,121
Yes.

34
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:03,081
Yes, it went well.

35
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:06,126
Gosh, you're the one who recommended me.

36
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,002
Thank you so much.

37
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,129
All right.

38
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:10,672
Okay, goodbye.

39
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:11,589
All right.

40
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,092
Goodness.

41
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:17,720
NA OK-HUI

42
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:18,721
Thank you.

43
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:19,722
Congratulations.

44
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,933
You got the job
right after your interview.

45
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:23,309
It all worked out.

46
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,072
Can't we just go and ask her?

47
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,241
You think she'd tell the truth?

48
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,368
I'd never tell if I were her.

49
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,579
You can run a background check.

50
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:51,963
Hello, Mr. Ju.

51
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:53,923
This is kind of urgent.

52
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,426
Can you run a background check?

53
00:02:56,509 --> 00:03:00,054
It can't be for just anyone.
It's only if they're related to a case.

54
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:02,932
Right. Well, I just got a tip.

55
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,143
I'm doing some work
outside the office right now.

56
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:06,853
I'll look into it when I return.

57
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:08,479
Okay, thank you.

58
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:10,565
What did he say?

59
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,985
He'll run the background check
when he gets to the office.

60
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:16,112
I think we should check after that.

61
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:17,822
But we don't have time for that.

62
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,242
Let's get dinner then.
What do you want to eat?

63
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,703
I have plans.

64
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:32,503
Does he…

65
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,840
know your secret?

66
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,470
I can't tell him. Not right now.

67
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,433
Call me if you're ever in trouble.

68
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,645
I'm always ready to be taken advantage of.

69
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,067
Thanks for today.

70
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:09,832
Fold if you're scared.

71
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,501
No one's going home.

72
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,088
Wait.

73
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:16,547
I got the best hand!

74
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:22,553
Can you be quiet, please?

75
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,896
Why must I come
all the way here just to see you?

76
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,315
How did you know about this place?

77
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,316
I know everything!

78
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,423
I wanted to ask you something.

79
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,135
Gong Eun-sim?

80
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:03,052
Yeah.

81
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:06,180
She's been active
in Seohan City for 24 years.

82
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,599
Couldn't you find something
if you ask the locals?

83
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,059
You could.

84
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:12,562
What's in it for me?

85
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:17,442
I should report you for illegal gambling.

86
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:19,610
Hey, that's not ethical!

87
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:23,239
You gripe about ethics so that's why
you always go broke at gambling dens.

88
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,324
Good grief.

89
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:27,952
You're just going to leave?

90
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:33,333
I'll be waiting.

91
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,003
Give me some money instead!

92
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,346
Since we came late, no one's here.

93
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,306
Isn't it nice?

94
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:51,559
You're right. Mr. Ju said you can't get
a table here without reservations.

95
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,520
Did you tell Mr. Ju about us?

96
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:58,316
I heard you already told Ga-yeong,
so I thought it wasn't a secret anymore.

97
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,567
I see.

98
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:04,322
It was actually still a secret.

99
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,658
Let's just keep it between us four then.

100
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:09,452
Only those two will know. No more.

101
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:12,080
-Sure, that's fine.
-Okay.

102
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,540
-Would you like to order?
-Yes.

103
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:15,583
We'll each have

104
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:17,794
the A course.

105
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:22,090
I'm sorry but the kitchen is closing soon.
You can only order single dishes.

106
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,257
Is that so?

107
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:24,175
In that case…

108
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:28,387
Then, we'll have two steaks
and the cheese platter.

109
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,014
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

110
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:34,644
Thank you.

111
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:38,773
-Please enjoy.
-Thank you.

112
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:39,774
Thank you.

113
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:44,695
Give that to me.

114
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,405
No, I already took a bite.

115
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:47,990
Who cares? I'll take it.

116
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:51,953
Thank you.

117
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:56,415
You can order more if that's not enough.

118
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,793
No, it's fine. I'm on a diet right now.

119
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,466
I don't think that'll be enough.
Let's go somewhere after.

120
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,509
Should we?

121
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,136
To tell you the truth,

122
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:11,055
small portions and expensive prices
give me indigestion.

123
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:13,766
I only ate cost-effective food
when I was studying for exams.

124
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,185
You know, right? Cheap but large portions.

125
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,563
-Like cup-bap?
-That's the best!

126
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:26,195
Have you thought about studying again?

127
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,489
Studying?

128
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:32,618
Well…

129
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:36,330
Do you know what's scarier
than studying again?

130
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:43,421
It's having to face another situation
where I have to give up.

131
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:46,340
TEST PREP
KOREAN

132
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,927
I worked so hard in life.

133
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:54,432
There was never a day
when I didn't work hard.

134
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:56,017
But…

135
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:01,189
what do I have to show for it?

136
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,400
That's what scares me the most.

137
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:11,407
That's why I want you to do
something you like.

138
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:14,785
Whatever that may be,

139
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,412
even if it's not studying,

140
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,789
I want you to do what you love

141
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:21,334
and feel excited instead of being scared.

142
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:28,007
Cheers.

143
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:29,592
Cheers.

144
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,142
Are you off tomorrow?

145
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:39,060
Tomorrow?

146
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:40,144
It's Sunday.

147
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,063
Well…

148
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:43,397
I know it's Sunday,

149
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:46,067
but my work schedule
is a bit unpredictable.

150
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:49,445
I'm really busy during the day.

151
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,991
I don't know what kind of work
you're doing with Ko Won,

152
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:56,744
but give what I said a serious thought.

153
00:08:58,287 --> 00:08:59,121
Okay.

154
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:01,624
I'll seriously think about it.

155
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:11,092
Something I want to do?

156
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:16,013
What I want to do…

157
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,937
Yeah, who knows what will happen?

158
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,355
I should prepare.

159
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:31,487
I WILL NEVER STOP

160
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,165
Do I need to get my books back
from the bookstore?

161
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,168
Grammar and…

162
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:47,795
vocabulary.

163
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:50,006
Wow, this is a blast from the past.

164
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:54,969
Let's see.

165
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:26,250
NA OK-HUI
BUT WHY?

166
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:33,966
How about this?

167
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,886
Create a situation
where she has to see you during the day.

168
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,180
If she uses work as an excuse
on weekdays,

169
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:41,390
just barge in on the weekend.

170
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,338
I couldn't come empty-handed.

171
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:13,839
Goodness!

172
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,758
How did you know I love flowers?

173
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:18,719
You're so thoughtful.

174
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,554
Gosh, you're here early.

175
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,598
He brought flowers. You hate flowers.

176
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:24,600
You should've just brought food.

177
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:25,518
Stop.

178
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,061
Should I go buy food?

179
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:28,938
No!

180
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:29,855
Come in.

181
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,690
Come on in.

182
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:41,700
Honey, go and wake Mi-jin.

183
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:44,286
She'll make a fuss if I wake her now.

184
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,540
You want to show him
your nearly 30-year-old daughter

185
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:50,292
who sleeps until noon?
Will that make you happy?

186
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:53,712
I'm just afraid she'll throw a fit
if she finds out Mr. Gye's here.

187
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:56,048
It's all a part of my plan.

188
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,716
That's why I'm being secretive.

189
00:11:58,342 --> 00:11:59,176
Hurry.

190
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:03,514
Ma'am, it's okay. I don't need to eat.

191
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:04,765
Goodness.

192
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,600
What are you saying?

193
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,853
You left last time without eating,

194
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:10,521
and I was so upset about it.

195
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:12,940
Here. Sit.

196
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:14,316
Take a seat.

197
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:17,695
Just wait a little longer.

198
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:21,365
Mi-jin's getting ready,
so she's a bit late.

199
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:23,868
That rascal. Hey, Mi-jin!

200
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:25,244
Mi-jin!

201
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,083
Hey, Mi-jin!

202
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,003
Gosh, that brat.

203
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,388
Ms. Lim?

204
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:50,811
By any chance,
has Ga-yeong's aunt been here recently?

205
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,688
-Ga-yeong's aunt?
-Yes.

206
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,148
Honey,

207
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:55,691
does Ga-yeong have an aunt?

208
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,277
Did you mistake my wife for her aunt?

209
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,029
Right.

210
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,865
Ga-yeong's mother passed away
when she was young,

211
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:05,284
so she treats me like her own mom.

212
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:06,327
That's right.

213
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:08,412
Then,

214
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:11,373
have you ever heard
of someone named Lim Sun?

215
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:20,341
How do you know our Sun?

216
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:22,551
"Our Sun"?

217
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,471
Actually, Lim Sun

218
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:27,014
was her sister.

219
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,853
To be honest,
it's my aunt's birthday today.

220
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:35,147
The aunt you resemble?

221
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,232
Yes.

222
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,816
She's not here,

223
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,860
but we always celebrate her birthday.

224
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,403
She doesn't have a date of death.

225
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:49,078
I'm so sorry.
I think I misspoke by mistake.

226
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,748
But why are you asking about Sun?

227
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,292
By any chance, did you find her?

228
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:56,377
Honey.

229
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,171
I mean, did you hear from her?

230
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,839
-No, I just--
-Where is she?

231
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,217
She's alive, right? Right?

232
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,720
I think I've confused her
for someone with the same name.

233
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:07,638
I'm sorry.

234
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,518
What's taking Mi-jin so long?

235
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:13,852
Hey, Mi-jin!

236
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:15,813
Mi-jin!

237
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:18,107
Mr. Gye's here! Come out!

238
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:20,568
-Hey!
-What?

239
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,195
Hey.

240
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,322
Mr. Gye's here. Come on out.

241
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,993
-Who?
-Mr. Gye's here.

242
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,787
Damn it. What do I do?

243
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:32,830
My gosh.

244
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:34,331
What do I do?

245
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:35,457
Come on.

246
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:37,626
Hey, Mi-jin!

247
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,169
Is something up with her?

248
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,171
-Gosh. Just a moment.
-Where's the key?

249
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,132
Mr. Gye's here!

250
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,258
What is she doing?

251
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:46,176
-Mi-jin?
-Honey, move.

252
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:49,263
-Jeez.
-That brat.

253
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:51,640
What is she doing?

254
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:57,438
Mi-jin?

255
00:14:57,521 --> 00:15:00,482
-Where did she go?
-But I heard her.

256
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,151
-What?
-Did she leave this morning?

257
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,194
-I didn't hear her go.
-Right?

258
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,279
Did she sneak out?

259
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,198
-Who's that lady?
-That lady!

260
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,492
-That hag!
-Isn't that her?

261
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:13,579
Honey, get her! Get her!

262
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:14,705
Get her!

263
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:18,083
DO NOT OPEN
OPEN IT DURING THE DAY AND I'LL RUN AWAY

264
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:21,295
That hurts!

265
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,012
-There's that woman!
-Move!

266
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:32,932
Stop right there!

267
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,646
Where did that lady go?

268
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:39,813
Where did she go?

269
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:42,024
What on earth? Did she get away already?

270
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,817
-Where is she?
-What's going on?

271
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,194
-Who is it?
-Did you see her?

272
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,071
She was wearing red.

273
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:48,739
Wait a second. Let's report it.

274
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:49,990
Then, I'll go this way.

275
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,700
-Okay! Go that way!
-Okay!

276
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:53,744
This way.

277
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:55,621
Hello, police?
I want to report a crime!

278
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:25,943
Damn.

279
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,069
It's so cold.

280
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:32,950
Where did she go?

281
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,159
-There she is!
-There she is!

282
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,369
Stop right there, lady!

283
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:37,579
Stop!

284
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,124
-Come here! Hey, lady!
-Hey, lady!

285
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:41,709
-Grab her! Stop!
-Hey!

286
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:44,169
-Where are you going? Get her!
-There she goes!

287
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:45,629
Get her!

288
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:49,425
Look, officer!

289
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:54,513
I'm telling you this crazy lady
came into our house again!

290
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:57,057
Ma'am, please take the hood off.
Right now.

291
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,475
Take it off, will you?

292
00:16:58,559 --> 00:16:59,393
Come on.

293
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:01,729
This is the second time!

294
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:06,233
In our country, how could someone
possibly do this in broad daylight?

295
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:09,528
For crying out loud!
Why won't you listen? Take your hood off!

296
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:11,071
Take it off!

297
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:13,699
-How dare you steal my daughter's clothes?
-Come on.

298
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:15,909
-What is the meaning of this?
-Hey.

299
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,286
-Honey.
-Please calm down.

300
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,203
Wait!

301
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,204
Take it off.

302
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,956
-Honey.
-Damn it!

303
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,624
Why is she so strong?

304
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,126
Goodness. Hey.

305
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,669
Honey, grab her!

306
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:27,254
-Gosh, be careful!
-Let go!

307
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:29,256
-Let go!
-Please let go!

308
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:30,841
Hey! Stop!

309
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:32,593
Please calm down!

310
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:34,053
My goodness!

311
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,888
-My gosh.
-Come on!

312
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:37,473
-See?
-It's her.

313
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,475
Here. Take it!

314
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,977
Come on! It's not even that expensive!

315
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:44,146
I was trying to study,

316
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:48,734
but you dragged me to a warehouse
with carryover inventory on 90% sale.

317
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:50,944
I said I didn't want to go.

318
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,489
But you said
that leftover bright red hoodie

319
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:54,990
would brighten up my dark skin.

320
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,200
Yeah, right!

321
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:57,409
You forced me to buy it.

322
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,578
I've always hated that hoodie!

323
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:00,621
So just take it.

324
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:02,873
Take it with you. You're so cheap.

325
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:03,916
What's going on?

326
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:05,751
How did she know that?

327
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,129
Come on, I told you!

328
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,506
I am

329
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,091
Lee Mi…

330
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:15,594
Mr. Gye!

331
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:25,687
I heard you caught the culprit.

332
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:26,814
Over here!

333
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,066
That's her.

334
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:34,780
Just a moment.

335
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:37,741
Is that you, Ms. Lim?

336
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:40,452
Ms. Lim?

337
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:44,206
Do you know her?

338
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,335
What? What's going on?

339
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:50,504
I don't know.

340
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,648
Tell me what happened.

341
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:13,902
I…

342
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,239
I really want to tell you too.

343
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:21,535
So…

344
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:24,079
The thing is…

345
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,587
Did you lie about being
Ga-yeong's aunt too?

346
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:36,258
Yes.

347
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,926
Who in the world are you?

348
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,636
Why did you sneak into Mi-jin's house?

349
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:46,226
Should we go to the interrogation room?

350
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,689
Do you know how much I trusted you…

351
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:57,362
Let me ask you one last thing.

352
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,698
What's your relationship with Mi-jin?

353
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:06,830
You can't tell me that either?

354
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,055
It's strange.

355
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,431
It's so strange.

356
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,435
I'm sure it's her.

357
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:30,520
She's that crazy lady.

358
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:31,897
Yeah, it's her.

359
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,733
But that lady looked so familiar.

360
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:37,611
I think she resembles Sun.

361
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,155
Honey…

362
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,490
I mean it.

363
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:44,660
A lot of time has passed and she's aged.

364
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,663
That's probably how she would look.

365
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,581
I wish that were true.

366
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,667
Honey, do you remember?

367
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:54,920
The text we got long ago.

368
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:57,798
Don't look for me.

369
00:20:57,881 --> 00:20:58,715
My goodness.

370
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,676
Don't report me missing either.

371
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,095
Still, she's alive. That's good enough.

372
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,436
I know she's alive.

373
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:14,815
Sun…

374
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,109
is alive.

375
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:26,868
DOGAVILL STUDIO APARTMENT
ROOMS FOR RENT

376
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:29,871
Damn it. Come on.

377
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,217
I've never seen this car before.

378
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:54,313
Hello, I'm in front of Dogavill.

379
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:55,731
Could you move your car?

380
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:08,035
I didn't know it was you.

381
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:12,164
Mr. Ju has a partner.

382
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,166
Don't tell me.

383
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:16,960
He's been off the market for a while.

384
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:23,300
We keep running into each other like this.
I can't help but think it must be fate--

385
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:24,509
Just move your car.

386
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:25,594
The car. Right.

387
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:37,022
My car needs to heat up a bit.

388
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:38,482
That means it needs time.

389
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:40,484
So if you're not busy,
would you like to…

390
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:42,986
come up for some ramyun?

391
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:46,698
Ramyun?

392
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,785
Yes, as you know,
I'm unbelievable with noodle dishes.

393
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,454
You really are unbelievable.

394
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:56,792
I should stuff him
into a tear gas chamber

395
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,377
and fill every single hole
in his body with poison.

396
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:05,175
Am I a pushover?

397
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:06,134
No.

398
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,844
Do I look like an idiot to you?

399
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:10,097
You worthless, lowdown…

400
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:12,891
How dare you? I'll claw your eyes out!

401
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:16,061
I'll knock them around for billiards
and smash them to pieces!

402
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:22,109
Don't park in front here.

403
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:23,235
Yes, ma'am.

404
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:29,825
-Move your damn car.
-Okay.

405
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:44,131
Mi-jin.

406
00:23:58,812 --> 00:23:59,980
Are you okay?

407
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,825
It was nice.

408
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,036
I may have been old,

409
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,874
but I was able to work.

410
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:20,709
It was so nice.

411
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:25,213
It made me forget about everything.

412
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:30,802
I deceived the people who trusted me.

413
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:33,471
I hurt them.

414
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:42,731
I can't do it anymore.

415
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:44,858
I don't want to hide

416
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:47,068
or keep things hidden.

417
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,698
I really can't do this anymore.

418
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:53,533
Okay.

419
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:56,494
Let's tell everyone.

420
00:24:58,914 --> 00:24:59,915
Let's tell them.

421
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,500
And let's go to jail.

422
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:06,546
What? Jail?

423
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:09,132
I'm sure they've grown
fond of you at work.

424
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:11,885
The prosecutor's office
wouldn't press charges, right?

425
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:14,471
Press charges?

426
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:16,806
Even if you get arrested and go to jail,

427
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:20,268
I'd still get to see you, right?

428
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:28,526
No, stop it.

429
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,861
Mi-jin.

430
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:32,280
Your life's terrible as it is.

431
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,910
It'll get downright awful
if you become an ex-convict.

432
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,037
What will you do?

433
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:41,957
Mi-jin, what are we going to do?

434
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:45,585
Ex-convict?

435
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:50,465
It'll be absolutely terrible.
What do we do?

436
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,472
Mi-jin, what will you do?

437
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,642
It's okay.

438
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:09,609
Ms. Lim!

439
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:10,735
She's my aunt.

440
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,654
-She's my niece.
-That's right, Aunt Sun.

441
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:14,572
Does Ga-yeong have an aunt?

442
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:18,076
Did you mistake my wife for her aunt?

443
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,786
Mr. Gye! Over here!

444
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:20,954
That's her.

445
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:23,039
Ms. Lim, what are you…

446
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:39,347
What's your relationship with Mi-jin?

447
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:42,142
I really want to tell you.

448
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:45,145
So… the thing is…

449
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:47,522
You can't tell me that either?

450
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:00,618
DOCUMENTS

451
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:34,903
Ma'am, what are you doing here?

452
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:37,072
Gosh, Mr. Gye. I'm so sorry.

453
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:39,741
I know it's not right
to bother a busy man like you,

454
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:42,619
but I just couldn't wait and do nothing.

455
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:44,621
It's fine. What's the matter?

456
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:46,081
Earlier today,

457
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:48,208
it seemed as if you knew that lady.

458
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:51,211
Do you know her name by any chance?

459
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,630
Well…

460
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:55,673
-She's our office assistant.
-Yes?

461
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:57,884
Her name's Lim Sun.

462
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:01,679
Lim Sun?

463
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,432
Lim Sun? That's what you said, right?

464
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:10,271
My goodness. I didn't recognize her.

465
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,981
I must be out of my mind.

466
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:14,651
Didn't you say you didn't know her?

467
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:17,278
She's my little sister.

468
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:19,489
-Excuse me?
-I'm sure of it.

469
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:21,116
The right face and name.

470
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:23,993
Even though it's been years,
I should've recognized her.

471
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:25,495
She must've been so shocked.

472
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:26,538
Sun…

473
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,206
My sister.

474
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,250
I can't believe it.

475
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,127
Wait.

476
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,920
Where is she right now?

477
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:39,217
Mom went to Mr. Gye's house?

478
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,385
Yeah.

479
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:41,845
She wanted to find your Aunt Sun.

480
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:44,806
She's at it again.
No one can stop her now.

481
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:46,683
-Gosh.
-I'm going to lose my mind.

482
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:50,061
But after hearing her out,

483
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:52,480
she really could be Sun.

484
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:55,400
Come on, Dad. Not you too!

485
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:58,695
Seriously, I bet that's what
she'd look like if she were still alive.

486
00:28:58,778 --> 00:28:59,904
It's so interesting.

487
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:02,115
She had a similar vibe.

488
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:06,327
This is driving me crazy.

489
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:54,501
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

490
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:00,048
I got the job.

491
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:03,927
Not me, but Lim Sun did it.

492
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:04,928
LIM SUN

493
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:06,721
I got the job!

494
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,932
-Really? I had the highest marks?
-Of course.

495
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:12,519
I've never been the best
in anything before.

496
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:14,479
Thank you!

497
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:27,450
THANK YOU

498
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:35,375
The Brave Intern Award.

499
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:40,255
I'll do my best to support you.

500
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:42,674
I'm your new office aide, Lim Sun.

501
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:46,970
I'd like to go too.

502
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:49,055
I can go in disguise or sneak in.

503
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:54,727
Don't worry.

504
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:57,730
I'll interpret it.

505
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:01,109
-Goodness.
-My gosh!

506
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:05,363
What are you doing?

507
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,240
Let's have a nice climb.

508
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:09,993
Mr. Gye!

509
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:11,619
This is it, right?

510
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:12,662
Yes.

511
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:15,665
Everyone, freeze!

512
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:17,417
Nobody move!

513
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:25,174
Let's really do our best.

514
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,343
For a long time, if possible.

515
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:52,952
THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING

517
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,261
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

518
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:36,704
Who are you?

519
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,498
Director Baek sent me here.

520
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:42,418
Director Baek?

521
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:52,804
Wait. What's this smell?

522
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:53,930
You don't recognize it?

523
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:07,610
Hold on.

524
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:17,954
This is it. This was the smell.

525
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:20,164
Director Baek wanted me
to check if it was right.

526
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,167
But what are these flowers?

527
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,085
Poppies.

528
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:25,670
Poppies?

529
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:35,888
SEOHAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

530
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:49,485
If you've quit, then don't regret it.

531
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,655
It's not good for your health.

532
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:59,120
Have we met somewhere before?

533
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:04,751
Gosh.

534
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:07,295
It's cold out here!

535
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:10,631
Don't you know you'll catch a cold?

536
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:14,719
I won't go!
I won't leave until my mom comes back!

537
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:16,554
Your mom isn't coming back.

538
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:17,889
Mal-tae.

539
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:19,390
Come on, Ji-ung.

540
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:23,227
I'll let you know if we find your mom.

541
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,187
Let's go, okay?

542
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:26,856
How many times do we have to tell you?

543
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:28,149
Your mom's dead!

544
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:30,485
My mom's not dead!

545
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:33,613
When my mom comes back,

546
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:36,574
I have to be here.

547
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:42,872
I had no idea.

548
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:46,084
I bet. A lot of time

549
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:47,919
has passed.

550
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,547
Anyway, you know why I'm here.

551
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:54,884
But was there another reason why
you came to this prosecutors' office?

552
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:02,225
Do you still think your mom's alive?

553
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:06,521
As a kid, I just wanted to think
she didn't abandon me.

554
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,314
What about now?

555
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:09,899
Even if she did abandon me…

556
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:13,945
I just hoped she was alive.

557
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:17,532
What if,

558
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:18,658
hypothetically,

559
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:20,576
she's dead?

560
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,661
The culprit

561
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:25,206
probably knew your mother was a witness.

562
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:26,791
How do you think they knew?

563
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:29,252
It's likely to be someone close to you.

564
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,756
Do you think

565
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,259
similar cases have occurred
since my return by coincidence?

566
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:38,970
Cases and coincidence.

567
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:40,972
If we've really found the culprit…

568
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:45,226
I might be able to find my mom soon.

569
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:02,577
BACKGROUND CHECK FORM

570
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:08,166
NAME: NA OK-HUI

571
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:09,333
NAME: NA OK-HUI

572
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:27,727
BACKGROUND CHECK FORM
NAME: GONG EUN-SIM

573
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:34,150
No wonder why she looked familiar.

574
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:36,611
She's Gong Eun-sim.

575
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,157
Ms. Lim!

576
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:44,202
Has Mr. Gye not come to work yet?

577
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:46,662
No. The person you asked
the background check for…

578
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:56,672
I came to say goodbye.

579
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:00,259
What do you mean?
Why would you say goodbye?

580
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:01,719
Let's talk outside.

581
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,848
Just talk here.

582
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:10,895
I ran the background check…

583
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:23,991
This is what you've decided on?

584
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:26,118
I'm sorry.

585
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:28,621
-What if I said it's okay?
-No.

586
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:30,581
I want to stop here.

587
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:32,375
Look, Ms. Lim.

588
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:35,253
Also, I'll take responsibility

589
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:37,255
for all I've done.

590
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:40,132
You're just going to leave
without even an explanation?

591
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,634
Why?

592
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:43,344
For what reason?

593
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:46,639
I'm sorry.

594
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:50,226
I don't want to hear you apologize.
Just explain it to me.

595
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,689
Thank you for everything.

596
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,235
I'm just wondering,

597
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:01,904
but does Mi-jin know about this?

598
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:05,950
What is your relationship with her?

599
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:14,750
Did you borrow her missing aunt's name
and make all this up to get a job?

600
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:26,220
Mi-jin's mother is looking for Lim Sun.

601
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:28,639
She thinks you're her sister.

602
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,516
What will you do about that?

603
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:33,644
You played with the emotions
of innocent people.

604
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:36,772
How are you going to
take responsibility for all of their pain?

605
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:39,191
Do you know how much Mr. Ju
and I trusted you?

606
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:41,068
Why would you--

607
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,154
I can't tell you right now.

608
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:44,238
I'm sorry.

609
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:45,323
Wait, hold on.

610
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:48,326
Ms. Lim!

611
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:05,551
Do you really have to go there?

612
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:06,969
Just write down the address.

613
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:09,388
This is driving me insane.

614
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:11,891
DOGAVILL WALLPAPER & REAL ESTATE

615
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:15,853
I'm not even sure about it.
I just heard it from someone.

616
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:17,438
Just write it down!

617
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:21,317
If you get caught or things go south,

618
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:22,735
it's not my fault.

619
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:24,403
I understand, so just write it.

620
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:27,948
What are you trying to do by seeing
Madame Kwak after all these years?

621
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:36,290
HWARIMDANG TEAHOUSE
23 DAEHO 3-GIL, SEOHAN CITY

622
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:42,963
HWARIMDANG TRADITIONAL TEAHOUSE

623
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:19,917
Ms. Lim!

624
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:22,962
Thank you for everything.

625
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:24,839
What do you mean? You're not leaving.

626
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:27,842
The background check you asked for.

627
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:29,593
-Na Ok-hui.
-Yes?

628
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:31,387
Is she the woman who works here?

629
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:34,765
-Yes.
-What was the tip you received?

630
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,694
THERE'S A SENIOR INTERN
WHO LIED ABOUT THEIR IDENTITY

631
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,364
What's the matter?

632
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,075
We were looking for a woman

633
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,536
named Gong Eun-sim
from Baek Cheol-gyu's drug list.

634
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:58,372
Can you take a look at this?

635
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,292
BACKGROUND CHECK FORM

637
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:06,255
But this is Na Ok-hui.

638
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:09,675
BACKGROUND CHECK FORM
NAME: NA OK-HUI

639
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:17,391
I have to check something.

640
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:22,897
Na Ok-hui didn't come to work today?

641
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,815
She said something urgent came up.

642
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:27,067
But why are you looking for her?

643
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,069
It's nothing. Never mind.

644
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:49,423
Are you Ms. Kang Gyeong-hui?

645
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,183
Help me…

646
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:00,184
Ma'am.

647
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:02,102
It's not my fault.

648
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:19,787
Okay, now.

649
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:29,755
Welcome.

650
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:32,216
KANG GYEONG-HUI

651
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:37,346
It's my wife's old account.

652
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:40,599
If someone tries
to withdraw money from this account,

653
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:41,517
please call me.

654
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,604
May I see your ID, please?

655
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:47,856
Yes. Here you go.

656
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:50,109
RESIDENT REGISTRATION
KANG GYEONG-HUI

657
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:54,196
Just a moment.

658
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:05,499
Director, please pick up.

659
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:13,215
-The number you've dialed is unavailable--
-Gosh.

660
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:14,717
Why won't he pick up?

661
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:32,276
SEOHAN BANK

662
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:56,300
The number you've dialed is unavailable.
Please leave a message after the tone.

663
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:57,343
Director.

664
00:43:57,885 --> 00:44:00,012
It's Lim Sun from the bank.

665
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:04,558
I think the person you mentioned before
came to the bank today.

666
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:46,892
DELETE MESSAGE?
YES

667
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:19,550
ROYAL COFFEEHOUSE

668
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:30,978
Hey, Ms. Teahouse!

669
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:35,774
Someone kept coming by here.

670
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:37,734
-A man or a woman?
-A man.

671
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:39,987
He asked how you've been.

672
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:42,030
He wanted to know why you weren't open.

673
00:45:42,656 --> 00:45:45,492
That's right.
He even asked for your number.

674
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:46,827
Of course, I shut him down.

675
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:48,078
Thank you.

676
00:45:48,787 --> 00:45:49,788
Okay, bye!

677
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:50,914
Bye.

678
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:07,014
Who are you?

679
00:46:11,226 --> 00:46:12,561
This is driving me crazy.

680
00:46:13,979 --> 00:46:14,980
Mr. Gye.

681
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:16,732
-I found Gong Eun-sim.
-What?

682
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:21,612
She took night classes at nursing school
and gave house call injections.

683
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,821
House call injections?

684
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:25,532
Yes, she administered
beauty injections or sedatives.

685
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:27,784
She usually got work by word of mouth,

686
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:31,205
so the middlemen were unknown
and operated in the shadows.

687
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:32,372
What about now?

688
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:34,416
If you look below, she had been running

689
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,251
a teahouse
by the police station recently.

690
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:37,920
She closed it and vanished months ago.

691
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:41,298
But you know what's even more shocking?

692
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:42,216
What?

693
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:44,218
She'd been right next to us.

694
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:45,385
What does that mean?

695
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:48,680
She pretended to be Na Ok-hui
and got a job here.

696
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:50,516
She's a senior intern like Ms. Lim.

697
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:52,851
This prosecutors' office?

698
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:54,603
I have to investigate further,

699
00:46:54,686 --> 00:46:57,814
but I ran a background check
on Na Ok-hui and she looks different.

700
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:00,192
RÉSUMÉ
NA OK-HUI

701
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:01,693
She looks like Gong Eun-sim.

702
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:04,863
But Gong Eun-sim… I mean, Gong Gi-cheol
looks much older than her actual age

703
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:08,825
because she disguised herself
as an old lady to fake her identity.

704
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:10,118
Where is she now?

705
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:12,829
She hasn't been to work
in days after Baek's arrest.

706
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:16,583
Her teahouse is by the police station?

707
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:20,587
Search the teahouse first. I'll track
her whereabouts with Detective Kwon.

708
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:21,630
Yes, sir.

709
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:33,183
NA OK-HUI

710
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:02,921
I don't know if you remember,
but long ago,

711
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:07,050
I once asked you
to help find my sister-in-law.

712
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:09,428
That's when we first met.

713
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:11,722
I see.

714
00:48:12,514 --> 00:48:14,141
You still haven't found her yet?

715
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:16,143
You remember.

716
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:19,229
I was wondering if it was too late

717
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:21,023
to ask for your help again.

718
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:25,777
It's been 20 years.

719
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:29,031
You still think she's alive?

720
00:48:29,114 --> 00:48:30,324
Still,

721
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:32,868
I need to know if she's alive or not.

722
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:35,871
My wife's still having a hard time.

723
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:37,414
My goodness.

724
00:48:37,497 --> 00:48:40,500
You're making this unmarried woman so sad.

725
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:51,553
You said you could find her before.

726
00:48:54,806 --> 00:48:57,100

KWAK WILL HELP FIND LIM SUN

727
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:59,728
Did you still have this?

728
00:49:02,397 --> 00:49:03,315
You're right.

729
00:49:04,524 --> 00:49:06,151
"Kwak Geum-hwa."

730
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:07,903
LEE WILL PAY SEVEN MILLION WON

731
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:09,696
CLIENT LEE HAK-CHAN
SIGNEE KWAK GEUM-HWA

732
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:13,533
You're suddenly quitting?

733
00:49:14,576 --> 00:49:15,535
Yes.

734
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:17,496
One bitch disappears,

735
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:19,915
and the other's suddenly quitting.

736
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:21,917
The store's already up for sale.

737
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,711
At least you told me,
so I put a little extra in there.

738
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:25,629
Thank you.

739
00:49:25,712 --> 00:49:26,880
Clean up a bit and go.

740
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:28,465
Okay.

741
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:31,885
Thank you, ma'am.

742
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:35,430
ROYAL COFFEEHOUSE

743
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:40,102
We're closed for the day.

744
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:43,855
No, we are here to ask you something.

745
00:49:45,982 --> 00:49:49,236
So you're looking for this person?

746
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:56,076
Yes, we heard a lady
from this coffeehouse disappeared too.

747
00:49:56,159 --> 00:50:00,622
So we were wondering
if you knew anything by chance.

748
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:01,707
That's why we came.

749
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:05,669
To be honest, my sister-in-law
sent a text before she disappeared.

750
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:08,755
She told us not to report her missing
or to look for her.

751
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:10,090
So why are you looking for her?

752
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:12,259
She'd never suddenly disappear like this.

753
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:14,469
We couldn't just sit back and wait.

754
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:18,306
My wife's killing herself over this,
and it hurts watching it happen.

755
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:20,726
We'd appreciate your help.

756
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:25,647
Detectives come by often,
so I did hear a few things.

757
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:26,982
Anything is fine.

758
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:29,401
But when it comes to people,

759
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:32,070
some things can't be done
on good intentions alone.

760
00:50:32,904 --> 00:50:33,739
I see.

761
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:35,782
How much will it take?

762
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:37,409
MY LOVE

763
00:50:38,785 --> 00:50:39,703
Answer your phone.

764
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:44,040
It's my wife. I can call her back.

765
00:50:49,254 --> 00:50:50,338
How pretty.

766
00:50:50,422 --> 00:50:51,715
Is that your daughter?

767
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:53,717
Yes. My daughter, Mi-jin.

768
00:50:59,264 --> 00:51:00,724
Lee Hak-chan.

769
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:02,934
Lee Mi-jin.

770
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:17,616
Ms. Lee Mi-jin!

771
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:24,790
LEE MI-JIN

772
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:27,918
LEE MI-JIN
LIM MI-JIN

773
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:31,505
I see.

774
00:51:34,633 --> 00:51:37,636
So her name was Lee Mi-jin.

775
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:11,169
By the way,

776
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:13,338
how did you find this place?

777
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:15,215
Does anyone know you're here?

778
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:17,384
No. No one knows, not even my wife.

779
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:21,721
What a relief.

780
00:52:32,941 --> 00:52:34,234
But who told you…

781
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:38,238
I was Kwak Geum-hwa?

782
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:51,209
Gosh, you're the one who recommended me.

783
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:52,127
GONG GI-CHEOL

784
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:54,170
Thank you so much. All right.

785
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:55,213
Goodbye.

786
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:57,173
Goodness.

787
00:52:58,925 --> 00:53:00,552
-Thank you.
-Congratulations.

788
00:53:00,635 --> 00:53:02,345
You got the job
right after your interview.

789
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:03,346
It all worked out.

790
00:53:10,061 --> 00:53:10,896
Excuse me.

791
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:13,231
What worked out?

792
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:14,691
I wasn't talking about you.

793
00:53:17,402 --> 00:53:18,612
No, not for you.

794
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:21,114
I was talking about me.

795
00:53:39,507 --> 00:53:40,383
COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO

796
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:47,557
Go back and play it from here.

797
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:48,808
-Yes, sir.
-Here.

798
00:53:53,229 --> 00:53:54,064
Hey, Mi-jin.

799
00:53:54,689 --> 00:53:55,523
I found her.

800
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:58,193
DOCUMENTS

801
00:53:59,277 --> 00:54:00,111
Ms. Lim?

802
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:01,613
Yes, I found the culprit.

803
00:54:02,822 --> 00:54:04,532
What do you mean you found the culprit?

804
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,826
I know who killed Ko Na-heun.

805
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:08,870
It's Na Ok-hui.

806
00:54:09,454 --> 00:54:11,247
Hey, stop. Zoom in there.

807
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:13,750
Is that her?

808
00:54:16,544 --> 00:54:17,545
Ms. Lim, wait.

809
00:54:18,254 --> 00:54:21,174
-Put an APB out on Gong Eun-sim.
-Yes, sir.

810
00:54:21,257 --> 00:54:22,258
Where are you right now?

811
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:25,053
I'm in the women's dressing room
at the office.

812
00:54:25,136 --> 00:54:28,098
Don't go anywhere and stay there.
It could be dangerous.

813
00:54:28,181 --> 00:54:29,599
Please stay where you are.

814
00:54:37,023 --> 00:54:38,274
The APB's out for Gong.

815
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:39,985
Can you track her location?

816
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:41,569
I'll head to her teahouse first.

817
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:42,570
Yes, sir.

818
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:50,912
Mi-jin, it's Dad. Can you come
to where I am? It's urgent.

819
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:52,205
What is this all of a sudden?

820
00:54:53,206 --> 00:54:54,249
Where is this?

821
00:54:57,752 --> 00:54:59,838
Hey, Dad. It's me…

822
00:55:01,339 --> 00:55:02,382
Dad?

823
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:04,342
Why aren't you talking?

824
00:55:05,218 --> 00:55:07,345
Can you hear me? Hello?

825
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:08,346
Hello…

826
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:14,519
DAD

827
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:19,566
The person you are trying to call
is unavailable. After the tone…

828
00:55:22,193 --> 00:55:23,278
What's going on?

829
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:29,534
Dad!

830
00:55:30,785 --> 00:55:31,745
DAD

831
00:55:35,915 --> 00:55:37,751
Hello? Dad?

832
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:39,335
Lee Mi-jin.

833
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:43,757
Who is this?

834
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,216
You don't know who I am?

835
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:48,428
We met once before at night.

836
00:55:50,346 --> 00:55:53,183
Listen to me carefully
if you want to see your dad again.

837
00:55:54,809 --> 00:55:56,269
Don't tell anyone.

838
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:58,313
Come to where we first met.

839
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:01,900
If you bring the cops, your dad will die.

840
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:06,571
You'd know better than anyone
if I was bluffing or not.

841
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:09,783
Okay.

842
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:13,328
My dad's safe, right?

843
00:56:13,411 --> 00:56:14,954
You should hurry

844
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:17,248
if you want to save your dad.

845
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:20,210
If something happens to my dad,
I'll kill you!

846
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:31,638
COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO

847
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:53,243
Excuse me, sir!

848
00:56:53,326 --> 00:56:54,869
Take me to Daeho Intersection!

849
00:56:54,953 --> 00:56:56,162
-Yes, ma'am.
-Quickly, please!

850
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:57,080
Yes, ma'am.

851
00:57:03,878 --> 00:57:04,712
Ga-yeong…

852
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:05,797
GA-YEONG

853
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,257
Please pick up.

854
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,593
MI-JIN

855
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:14,556
Could you do it as gently as possible,
so it doesn't hurt?

856
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:16,599
It won't hurt as much as you expect.

857
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:18,268
-Really?
-No.

858
00:57:18,351 --> 00:57:19,477
Let's begin.

859
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:20,854
Just a moment.

860
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:24,607
Hey, my dears!

861
00:57:25,316 --> 00:57:28,945
I'm here to get treatment on my skin.
My gosh, I'm so nervous!

862
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:32,490
The procedure I'm about to have
is the most popular one at clinics.

863
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:34,659
Ta-da! Here it is!

864
00:57:34,742 --> 00:57:38,955
Now, let's see
how I end up with glowing skin.

865
00:57:39,038 --> 00:57:40,248
Bye!

866
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:43,126
Okay, I think we can start now.

867
00:57:43,209 --> 00:57:44,919
-Okay, I'll begin.
-Okay.

868
00:57:45,628 --> 00:57:47,714
Gosh. I'm so nervous, my dears.

869
00:57:49,674 --> 00:57:51,593
-Wow, it doesn't hurt.
-Yes. Not bad, right?

870
00:57:51,676 --> 00:57:54,679
My dears, it doesn't hurt that much.

871
00:57:58,308 --> 00:57:59,851
MI-JIN

872
00:58:01,769 --> 00:58:03,521
NEW MESSAGE FROM MI-JIN

873
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:07,317
Mr. Ju!

874
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,527
Mr. Gye, I was going to call you.

875
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:11,905
-Where's Na Ok-hui?
-The teahouse is closed.

876
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:14,365
The store owner downstairs
said she came by this morning.

877
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:17,285
That woman, Na Ok-hui. She's the culprit.

878
00:58:17,368 --> 00:58:19,412
Then, what about Gong Gi-cheol?

879
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:21,873
Just as you said,
Gong Gi-cheol is Na Ok-hui.

880
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:30,340
Thank you.

881
00:59:02,914 --> 00:59:04,541
DAEHO-RI
1 KM

882
00:59:05,124 --> 00:59:07,502
Where is she?

883
00:59:07,585 --> 00:59:08,419
My phone.

884
00:59:08,503 --> 00:59:09,963
RESTRICTED NUMBER

885
00:59:10,838 --> 00:59:11,798
Where are you?

886
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:14,968
Are you Lee Mi-jin?

887
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:16,386
Where's my dad?

888
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:18,763
You didn't bring the cops, did you?

889
00:59:18,846 --> 00:59:20,932
I swear on my life. I'm not foolish.

890
00:59:21,015 --> 00:59:23,059
I've changed the location though.

891
00:59:23,142 --> 00:59:25,478
Let's see if you have
dogs chasing after you.

892
00:59:26,145 --> 00:59:27,814
Don't think of calling the cops.

893
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:30,108
Then, you'll find your dad's corpse.

894
00:59:30,191 --> 00:59:32,443
You know how I killed the others.

895
00:59:34,529 --> 00:59:35,697
You've seen the news.

896
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:40,410
Wait.

897
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:44,998
Where is this place?

898
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:47,917
Where is it?

899
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:45,224
DAD

900
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:09,499
Dad!

901
01:01:50,915 --> 01:01:53,835
MISS NIGHT AND DAY

902
01:01:55,586 --> 01:01:58,005
Lee Mi-jin, you want to see your dad?

903
01:01:58,089 --> 01:01:59,757
What did you do to my dad?

904
01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:01,592
What do you mean you found the culprit?

905
01:02:01,676 --> 01:02:03,636
I know who killed Ko Na-heun.

906
01:02:04,929 --> 01:02:06,264
You shouldn't have made a fuss.

907
01:02:06,347 --> 01:02:09,434
