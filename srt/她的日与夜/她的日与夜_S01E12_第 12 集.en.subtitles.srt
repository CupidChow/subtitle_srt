1
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:45,962
MISS NIGHT AND DAY

2
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:15,575
I've waited for so long
after you disappeared 24 years ago.

3
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,245
I waited for you to reappear.

4
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,793
RESTRICTED
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

5
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:26,294
OPERATING ROOM

6
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:28,713
The number you've dialed is unavailable--

7
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:31,424
WIFE

8
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:34,594
You want to report your wife missing?

9
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:35,512
Yes.

10
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:39,766
So you're saying your wife
hasn't been home for a week now, right?

11
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:41,017
Yes.

12
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,019
But why are you reporting it now?

13
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:45,480
If you report an adult missing right away,

14
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:48,107
they'll just be reported as a runaway.

15
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:52,362
I checked all
of her credit card transactions.

16
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:55,532
Strangely, no transactions
were made after she disappeared.

17
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:56,950
No calls were made either.

18
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:58,952
What does that mean?

19
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:01,037
There's no sign of everyday activities.

20
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,038
Anything else?

21
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:03,665
Also,

22
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:06,459
I confirmed
she frequently visited motels.

23
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:07,585
DAEHO MOTEL

24
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:10,463
It seems she continuously met someone

25
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,549
at these motels.

26
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:15,635
It's about money in most crimes.

27
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:16,636
CALIFORNIA DREAM MOTEL

28
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:20,306
This has a similar pattern
to kidnapping and missing persons cases.

29
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,393
You should check her bank accounts first.

30
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:29,065
Gosh. It's been so long, Director Baek.

31
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:31,985
I have a favor to ask of you, Ms. Lim.

32
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:33,862
Sure. Have a seat.

33
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:36,156
This.

34
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:38,158
It's my wife's old account.

35
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:39,159
KANG GYEONG-HUI

36
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,911
If someone tries
to withdraw money from this account,

37
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:42,871
please call me.

38
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:46,875
Goodness.

39
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:49,335
I'm asking because I know I can trust you.

40
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:50,295
Please.

41
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,548
Please help me out.

42
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:01,806
LIM SUN

43
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,312
All the way straight! Okay!

44
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:08,479
Goodness.

45
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:09,772
Hold on.

46
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:11,983
We identified the victim.

47
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:15,194
It's Kang Gyeong-hui, the wife
of Hwadong Medical Center's director.

48
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:17,989
Hwadong Medical Center…

49
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:20,533
Dr. Baek Cheol-gyu?

50
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:27,457
Mr. Baek Cheol-gyu.

51
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,084
You're under arrest
for the murder of Kang Gyeong-hui.

52
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,628
You have the right to remain silent.

53
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:35,256
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

54
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,926
So your wife didn't come home
the day before,

55
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:40,011
but you just went home and rested?

56
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:42,764
I thought she'd be back like before.

57
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:46,309
That means this wasn't the first time
she's left home without warning.

58
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:49,187
Were you and your wife
experiencing any troubles…

59
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:52,982
Shouldn't you go out and catch the culprit
instead of doing this?

60
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,901
Yes, we should.

61
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,320
But if we want to catch them,

62
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:00,949
we need to confirm
if you really were at home

63
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:02,784
on that day.

64
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:05,078
Are you saying I did it?

65
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:11,000
You reported your wife missing
after she had been gone for a week.

66
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,502
On the day before she disappeared…

67
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,173
-You two fought, right?
-Of course not!

68
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,633
My wife is dead!

69
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:21,261
And it's killing me right now!

70
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:24,138
But what did you say to me?
I'm the culprit?

71
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,226
SEOHAN PROVINCIAL POLICE AGENCY

72
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:31,312
Your alibi checks out,
so we're releasing you.

73
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,940
But you haven't been ruled out
as a suspect yet.

74
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:37,986
THREE MISSED CALLS
SEOHAN BANK LIM SUN

75
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:43,408
The number you've dialed is unavailable--

76
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,831
Hello, Seohan Bank? Ms. Lim…

77
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:53,042
I mean, I'd like to speak with Lim Sun.

78
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,961
Ms. Lim has resigned.

79
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:56,671
Wait a minute!

80
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:59,590
She was working there recently.
What do you mean she resigned?

81
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:02,927
I looked into her colleagues,
friends, and old classmates,

82
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,013
but Lim Sun has just vanished.

83
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,639
What do you mean by that?

84
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:09,684
Well, when you gave her
the bankbook that day,

85
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,602
she must've figured it out and fled.

86
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:15,231
Are you saying Lim Sun could be
the culprit who killed my wife?

87
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,733
Or she could be working with them.

88
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,028
In any case, I'm certain

89
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:22,947
that Lim Sun is closely linked
to your wife's case.

90
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,160
Do whatever you can to find Lim Sun.

91
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:29,495
If she's deliberately hiding,
it'll be very hard--

92
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:33,041
I don't care how much it costs
or how long it takes.

93
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:35,752
You must find her for me.
Do whatever it takes.

94
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,172
RESIDENT REGISTRATION

95
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:41,007
CHILDREN - LEE MI-JIN
SIBLING - LIM SUN

96
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:44,343
I've been looking for you for decades.

97
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:47,346
I gathered
all the information I could on you.

98
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,515
Family and medical records. Everything.

99
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:52,560
I looked through every last trace of you.

100
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:53,811
And I kept digging.

101
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:55,313
But…

102
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,607
I couldn't find you.

103
00:05:58,357 --> 00:06:00,401
As time went by, I grew anxious.

104
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:04,280
If I couldn't find you,
it would all be over.

105
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:05,490
EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH
LIM SUN

106
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:08,117
I couldn't let that happen. I wouldn't.

107
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:12,872
I waited for so long to find you.

108
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,669
After I lost my wife,
I drowned myself in alcohol

109
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,129
and even became sick.

110
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,340
So overnight, I was banned from surgeries.

111
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,718
I lost everything!

112
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:29,388
My family! My reputation! Everything!

113
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:38,815
No. It wasn't me.

114
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,358
It wasn't me.

115
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:42,276
The only person who can tell me

116
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,904
why my wife died, how she died,
and who killed her

117
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:47,323
is you, Lim Sun.

118
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:49,367
I'm not Lim Sun!

119
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:52,078
Even if you're impersonating
the real Lim Sun,

120
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:54,413
you know for sure who she is.

121
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,749
If not, it makes no sense

122
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,794
for you to steal her identity
to enter the prosecutor's office.

123
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:02,213
Sure, let's grab a bite sometime.

124
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:04,423
Yes, okay.

125
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:06,509
Goodbye.

126
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:10,888
Hello?

127
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:15,685
You found Lim Sun?

128
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,025
Do you recognize her?

129
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:26,237
Not at all. It's been decades.

130
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:28,990
What are you going to do?

131
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,326
I'll take it from here.

132
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:36,789
So you're saying

133
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:39,625
I just have to get this woman
to come to the hospital?

134
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,544
Her face will be scratched up a bit.

135
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,212
Don't hurt her too badly.

136
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:46,966
She has to be brought in one piece.
Can you do it?

137
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:48,759
Don't worry.

138
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:51,012
If this goes smoothly,

139
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:53,890
the next fentanyl shipment
won't be an issue. Right, Director?

140
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:11,199
ACID ATTACKER CAUGHT BY 50-YEAR-OLD

141
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:24,504
Mr. Mayor, it's Dr. Baek
from Hwadong Medical Center.

142
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,091
Yes, I was hoping we could grab a meal.

143
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,719
-I'm honored to work with you.
-Thank you.

144
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:35,348
If you're curious or have questions
about anything, you can ask me.

145
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:37,475
I'm the youngest one here.

146
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:40,436
You are quite young
for a senior public intern.

147
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,063
That's a great smile too.

148
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:45,733
I impersonated her.

149
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:48,069
As you said, I've lived for decades

150
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:49,862
quietly and in complete secrecy.

151
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:54,158
I had absolutely no idea
I'd run into anyone like this.

152
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,077
Still refusing to talk?

153
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,164
There's nothing I can tell you! I swear!

154
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:02,833
I never expected you to tell me so easily.

155
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:06,254
Please, believe me!

156
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:14,220
I'll make you talk
even if I have to numb your mind.

157
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:16,389
But…

158
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,395
How long have I been trapped here?

159
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,564
It was around 4:00 p.m.
when I was brought here.

160
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,276
Has the sun set yet?
It's going to get dark soon.

161
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:38,786
Wait! Wait a second!

162
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:42,790
Wait! I'll prove it!

163
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:44,917
I'll prove it.

164
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,919
I'll prove that I'm not Lim Sun.

165
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:49,839
I can show you who I am.

166
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:52,717
Please!

167
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:54,176
We don't have to leave.

168
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:56,345
Please believe me. Just once.

169
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:59,432
I'll prove it to you right here.

170
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:04,437
Please.

171
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,367
Mr. Gye!

172
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,203
The raid's over. Why are you here?

173
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,872
I'm looking for someone.

174
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:23,873
Is it Ms. Lim?

175
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:25,333
What about her?

176
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,460
She suddenly disappeared
while we were working.

177
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:29,170
I'm sure she'll call.

178
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:31,130
Anyway, I'm looking for someone.
See you later.

179
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:32,798
What? But Mr. Gye…

180
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:34,425
Mr. Gye!

181
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:37,928
Who is he looking for?
Why is he running off so frantically?

182
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:53,110
MI-JIN

183
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:56,864
What is this?

184
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:58,824
Have these with you just in case.

185
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:24,558
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

186
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:45,413
Mr. Ju!

187
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,124
Request backup
to the basement storage room.

188
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:03,180
That's strange. Why won't I change?

189
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,641
Your time's up.

190
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:10,312
You had your chance to prove
you weren't Lim Sun,

191
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,273
and it's over now.

192
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:14,108
What time is it right now?

193
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,445
Maybe the sun's still up. It has to set.

194
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,332
HWADONG MEDICAL CENTER

195
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:33,419
Damn it!

196
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,506
Sir! The sun could set late!

197
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,591
Please!

198
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:04,950
Lee Mi-jin!

199
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:07,453
Mr. Gye?

200
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,080
Over here! I'm over here!

201
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,383
Are you okay?

202
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,010
Behind you!

203
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:38,526
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm okay.

204
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,213
Mr. Gye!

205
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:03,592
Don't.

206
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,056
Don't do it.

207
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,243
Are you okay?

208
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,846
It's okay.

209
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:50,556
I'm here now.

210
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,861
Mi-jin?

211
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,824
Mr. Gye, what's going on…

212
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,290
We have people injured
in Hwadong's basement.

213
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:17,958
Yes, the basement storage room! Hurry!

214
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:26,759
AMBULANCE

215
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:30,512
EMERGENCY CENTER

216
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:48,447
Mr. Gye.

217
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,032
Are you awake?

218
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:52,993
Please don't call my parents.

219
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,914
Okay. Hold on. We're almost there.

220
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,548
SUSPECT INTERROGATION FORM

221
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:19,812
There are many watchful eyes.

222
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:22,898
That's why we've brought you
here to the prosecutors' office.

223
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,441
So we ask that you cooperate.

224
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:30,906
A vehicle hanging around
the victim's house

225
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,492
was also spotted on CCTV
near the hospital.

226
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:38,414
After hiring someone to watch Lee Mi-jin,
you kidnapped her, right?

227
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,128
Who?

228
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:51,885
You're the one who kidnapped her.
Did you forget already?

229
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,262
Ms. Lee Mi-jin.

230
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,005
Are you okay?

231
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:29,673
Mr. Gye.

232
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:32,885
-How do you feel?
-I'm okay.

233
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:40,309
Were you hurt?

234
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:44,146
It's just a scratch.

235
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,149
You should have it treated right away.

236
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:49,485
It's no big deal.

237
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,987
Worry about yourself. Look at this.

238
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:55,824
That must've hurt.

239
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:01,371
Does it hurt?

240
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,209
Ms. Lee Mi-jin…

241
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:08,587
I mean, the victim's blood
has been sent to NFS.

242
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,924
Fortunately, she's not hallucinating,
so it wasn't a narcotic.

243
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:13,258
And Baek Cheol-gyu?

244
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,843
The perpetrator isn't talking,

245
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,596
and it just so happens
the victim can't remember anything.

246
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:26,355
Is there anything else
you'd like to tell me?

247
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:33,695
To be honest, Lee Mi-jin
is a witness in Ko Na-heun's murder case.

248
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:34,780
Excuse me?

249
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:39,952
But that wasn't
in the case file when we got it.

250
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:41,829
I purposely didn't tell the police.

251
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:42,871
Why not?

252
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:47,417
I should've done whatever I could
to catch him before.

253
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:53,215
Lee Mi-jin is a witness in a murder case.

254
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:54,925
And if Baek's the culprit…

255
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:58,011
I see. I get it now.

256
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,557
Baek Cheol-gyu did say something though.

257
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,725
He said he didn't kidnap Lee Mi-jin.

258
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,770
He's denying his crime. Utter nonsense.

259
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,775
If you denied committing a crime,

260
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:14,153
wouldn't you say
you didn't kidnap anyone at all?

261
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:20,117
So he admits to kidnapping someone,
but it wasn't Lee Mi-jin.

262
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:21,785
Is that it?

263
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:27,791
Cover yourself with this.

264
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,335
The car's not warm yet,
so it's cold. Be careful.

265
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:49,438
From the first time we met and even now,

266
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:52,065
you're always saving me.

267
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,778
I'm sorry. I couldn't keep my promise.

268
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,032
I should've protected you at all costs.

269
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:03,076
I should've locked him up
before this happened.

270
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,078
Does he still not know?

271
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,999
If Baek Cheol-gyu talked, he'd know.

272
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,377
Baek Cheol-gyu won't talk.

273
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:17,341
So your statement is important,

274
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:19,968
but there's no need
to force yourself to remember.

275
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,304
The most important thing
is that you feel at ease.

276
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:26,642
The only person who can tell me

277
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,228
why my wife died, how she died,
and who killed her

278
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,188
is you, Lim Sun.

279
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,196
-Mr. Gye?
-Yes?

280
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:43,659
I don't think
Baek Cheol-gyu's the culprit.

281
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,706
We can't be sure about anything yet.

282
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,334
Whether he's the culprit or not,

283
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,378
we'll conduct an investigation
to find out.

284
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,338
So for now,

285
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,882
don't think about anything and rest. Okay?

286
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:01,677
Okay.

287
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:04,137
-Put your seat belt on. Let's go.
-Okay.

288
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:17,067
Lift your foot.

289
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:22,572
Did you hear?

290
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:24,199
About what?

291
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,369
Director Baek was arrested.

292
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:28,912
What?

293
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,956
Goodness gracious.

294
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,417
I guess a disaster did happen after all.

295
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,334
My goodness.

296
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:35,502
I don't believe this.

297
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:37,004
Goodness.

298
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:39,423
It seems like you know something.

299
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,258
Please tell us.

300
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:45,846
It's not related
to Ko Na-heun's death, is it?

301
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:49,599
Why do you keep trying to link
Ko Na-heun's case with this?

302
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:52,644
-It's ridiculous.
-I'm not the only one who's thinking it.

303
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:55,814
I heard Baek Cheol-gyu
killed his own wife.

304
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:57,899
-He killed his wife?
-Yeah.

305
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,277
My goodness.

306
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:05,240
The most normal-looking people
are the most sinister on the inside!

307
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:07,326
Goodness.

308
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:10,078
It's like he waited for Ko Na-heun
to leave so he could join.

309
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,580
I knew it was strange.

310
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,165
Did he come to investigate the case?

311
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,334
Don't go around
ignorantly spreading rumors.

312
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:17,252
Just get back to work! Come on.

313
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,920
What? "Ignorantly"?

314
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:21,506
Well, how else would you describe it then?

315
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,091
-"Ignorantly"?
-Lower your voices!

316
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,969
You rude punk!
Why do you always speak like that?

317
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,596
Why do you talk so rudely?

318
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,306
-Goodness!
-Why?

319
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:30,932
Sun, are you okay?

320
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,684
What?

321
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,771
You look terrible.

322
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:37,272
I'm fine.

323
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:40,067
Did you hear
about Director Baek Cheol-gyu?

324
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:44,738
They say he's the one
who killed Ko Na-heun.

325
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:45,781
Who said that?

326
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,783
The rumors have already spread!

327
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:50,243
He had an ulterior motive for coming here.

328
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:51,328
How terrifying.

329
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:54,372
How terrifying! My goodness!

330
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:24,402
Ms. Lim doesn't even drink those,
so I'll help myself.

331
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:27,447
You shouldn't drink what's not yours.

332
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:31,159
He's been loitering here for a few days.

333
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,078
Do you think they already broke up?

334
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:34,788
What do you mean?

335
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:37,374
Ko Won and Ms. Lim.

336
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:39,126
Right, so what about them?

337
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,254
I told you last time.

338
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:43,380
What?

339
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,051
Did you know too, Mr. Gye?

340
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:49,719
About the person he likes.

341
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:54,558
The feelings are mutual,
so how can you stop them, right?

342
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:56,643
They're mutual?

343
00:23:56,726 --> 00:24:01,606
Yes, I thought it was one-sided at first,
but it seems to have become mutual.

344
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,362
So you're saying

345
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:10,407
Ko Won and Ms. Lim are dating?

346
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,659
Who the hell said that nonsense?

347
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:19,374
It wasn't me. Mr. Ju said…

348
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:22,252
Hey, didn't you take the morning off?
Why are you so early?

349
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:24,171
Where did you hear such nonsense?

350
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:27,007
You've got to be kidding me!
Unbelievable!

351
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:29,217
-I can't even speak!
-Are you okay?

352
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,344
No. I mean, it's okay.

353
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:32,262
I mean,

354
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:34,055
you have to chase down those fools

355
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:36,600
who spew nonsense like that
and slug them in the ear!

356
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:41,313
I'll pluck their ribs out and turn them
into a xylophone to play on!

357
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:44,399
You can go home
if you're not feeling well.

358
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:45,442
I'm fine.

359
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:46,776
Gosh, I'm so mad. My head!

360
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:50,030
-My head.
-What's wrong with your hand?

361
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:52,282
I played a game with my nieces
that had punishments.

362
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,993
About the person he likes.

363
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,834
Why are you laughing?

364
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,252
No, I'm not laughing.

365
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:06,046
Hold on.

366
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:07,547
You're laughing at me right now.

367
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:09,591
-I'm not!
-Seriously.

368
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,134
You're so annoying!

369
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:13,053
I've never seen him laugh like that.

370
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,597
Mr. Ju, look.

371
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,266
Who said that rumor
about Ko Won and me? Tell me.

372
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:19,809
To be honest,

373
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:22,604
you two feed each other,
ride home together after work,

374
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:24,898
and gift each other vitamins.
That's what I heard.

375
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:26,316
-It's what I heard.
-I see.

376
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:27,651
-I bet it was you!
-No!

377
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:29,152
-Come here.
-No, I heard it.

378
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:30,654
-It's okay. Come here.
-Mr. Gye.

379
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:32,030
-Jeez, let's go.
-Mr. Gye.

380
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:34,282
-I support you two!
-Could you hold down the fort?

381
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,159
Mr. Gye! No! Wait!

382
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:41,039
So that's what it was.

383
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:42,332
Gosh.

384
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:44,668
I had no idea.

385
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:45,835
Gosh.

386
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,754
That was enough laughs for the year.

387
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,344
You've been coming straight home
after work lately.

388
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:56,888
I'm so proud of you.
You're so ambitious.

389
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:01,017
Coming straight home is the problem.

390
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,519
You should be busy dating

391
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:04,354
or at least getting to know some guys.

392
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:06,731
But after work,
you lock yourself up at home.

393
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:10,193
How is always having dinner
with your parents ambitious?

394
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:12,153
Even if she's not ambitious,

395
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,531
it's very inspiring
from a family harmony standpoint.

396
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:15,490
"Inspiring"?

397
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:17,575
I'll do the dishes.

398
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,703
Go to your room
and put a sheet mask on instead.

399
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:21,997
What's with your face? It looks rough.

400
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:25,417
You do the dishes, honey.
Do them inspiringly.

401
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,460
Thanks for dinner.

402
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,255
I planned on doing them inspiringly.

403
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,222
Mi-jin! Here. Answer the phone.

404
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:40,640
It's Mr. Gye!

405
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:42,517
Come on! Take it!

406
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,102
No, I don't need to answer it now.

407
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:45,312
Hurry!

408
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,368
What brings you here?

409
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:03,580
This is tea. They say it helps you sleep.

410
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:04,873
Try drinking some before bed.

411
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:09,377
Is this why you came here?

412
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:11,379
Also,

413
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,840
you know the drugs
Baek injected you with?

414
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:18,053
It turns out it was just a muscle relaxant
commonly used in the hospital.

415
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:19,804
So you don't have to worry.

416
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:21,348
I see. Okay.

417
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:24,601
You could've told me over the phone.

418
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:28,188
Still, I wanted to see you in person

419
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:31,358
and came to make sure that you were okay.

420
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:34,027
You're okay, right?

421
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:36,529
Yeah, I'm okay.

422
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:40,283
Well, since I got to see you, I'll go now.

423
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:45,330
Take care.

424
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:52,170
It's cold. Go inside.

425
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:54,464
I will. Thanks for the tea.

426
00:27:55,673 --> 00:27:56,508
You're welcome.

427
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,109
Hey, those are provocative words.

428
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,110
What's with you?

429
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:27,539
So what happened?

430
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:29,916
Why did he come? What is it this time?

431
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,210
Tea.

432
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:34,045
Tea?

433
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,006
-Like what you brew and drink?
-Yeah.

434
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,426
-He came here at night to give you that?
-Yeah.

435
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:43,972
Goodness, he's making up
all types of excuses, isn't he? Gosh.

436
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:45,181
Did anything else happen?

437
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:46,850
No!

438
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:49,436
-What? I like tea.
-Me too.

439
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:54,023
I swear, you two are like peas in a pod.

440
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:57,402
Hey, you brat! If you like him,

441
00:28:57,485 --> 00:28:58,737
why can't you tell him?

442
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,405
Gosh, you're so frustrating!

443
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:02,240
That's because of your menopause.

444
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:06,703
Yummy.

445
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:24,095
Over here!

446
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:29,851
I'm over here!

447
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:32,270
Don't do it.

448
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,904
-No!
-Die!

449
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:52,433
Baek Cheol-gyu won't talk.

450
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:55,520
So your statement is important,

451
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:58,106
but there's no need
to force yourself to remember.

452
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:00,817
The most important thing
is that you feel at ease.

453
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:11,035
If Baek Cheol-gyu keeps quiet,
what will happen then?

454
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:16,249
What if they can't catch the culprit?

455
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:36,644
SEOHAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

456
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:43,276
The only person who can tell me

457
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:46,029
why my wife died, how she died,
and who killed her

458
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:48,031
is you, Lim Sun.

459
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:52,952
He won't budge.

460
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:57,165
Did Baek Cheol-gyu refuse
to give a statement again?

461
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:58,875
He's very resolute.

462
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:00,960
He won't even drink any water.

463
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:02,921
The silver lining is

464
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:06,549
the high-powered legal team
we expected hasn't shown up yet.

465
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:11,888
Maybe he isn't the culprit.

466
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:13,806
What?

467
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,058
If that's the case,

468
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:17,977
won't we miss our chance
to catch the real culprit?

469
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:23,858
He's invoking his right to remain silent.

470
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:26,611
Won't it be faster
to raid Club Hovan and investigate?

471
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:29,280
He can get at least a ten-year sentence
for distributing drugs.

472
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:31,282
If we mess up
and it backfires, it's all over.

473
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,997
We just need Baek Cheol-gyu's statement.

474
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:47,465
I'll do it.

475
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:49,092
I'll meet with Baek.

476
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:50,218
What?

477
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,719
We used to work together

478
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,012
and were on good terms.

479
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:55,223
I'll try my best to convince him.

480
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,476
-But--
-Please.

481
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:02,605
Trust me just this once.

482
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:30,550
This is…

483
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:32,176
Do you think this is okay?

484
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,595
She's not one to talk nonsense.

485
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,305
She must have something in mind.

486
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:43,980
The reason why you're refusing to speak

487
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:46,399
isn't because you don't want to.

488
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,234
It's because you can't, right?

489
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:01,372
-Why did she turn off the mic?
-Wait.

490
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:02,623
Let's keep watching.

491
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,799
Because the person you kidnapped

492
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,843
was Lim Sun, not Lee Mi-jin.

493
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:18,681
But you're sitting here
on charges of kidnapping Lee Mi-jin.

494
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:20,892
If I tell you,

495
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:23,895
will you believe me?

496
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:15,446
What kind of trick is this?

497
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,156
I'm Lim Sun's niece.

498
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:18,908
I'm Mi-jin.

499
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:21,536
Is that the best excuse
you could come up with?

500
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:24,789
Lim Sun and Lee Mi-jin
are the same person?

501
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:29,836
What are you trying to accomplish
with this doctored video?

502
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:32,797
Decades.

503
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:36,175
I've been digging and searching
for over 20 years.

504
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:38,678
"Why did Lim Sun disappear?"

505
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:39,804
"For what reason?"

506
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:43,808
"What happened right after she met me?"

507
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:45,059
This won't do.

508
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,227
Wait a second.

509
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:02,743
I understand.

510
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:04,912
At first,

511
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:08,082
I couldn't believe it either.

512
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,130
I had forgotten everything,

513
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:16,883
but I remember now.

514
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,427
When I was a kid,

515
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,179
you treated me yourself.

516
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:29,020
This wound on my forehead.

517
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:31,147
Do you remember it?

518
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:34,233
I got hurt riding my bike.

519
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,277
You treated me and told me something.

520
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:42,116
You said I looked just like my aunt.

521
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:45,203
But is she really your aunt?

522
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:46,204
Yes.

523
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:48,247
You look just like your aunt.

524
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:52,043
Here.

525
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:54,670
If she was your mom, we'd believe it.

526
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,132
Great job.

527
00:36:58,674 --> 00:36:59,634
You're so brave.

528
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:05,056
I thought being under this damn curse

529
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:08,142
and having no choice
but to steal my aunt's identity

530
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,894
was all a coincidence.

531
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:12,605
But I realized
after hearing what you said.

532
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:15,107
Perhaps…

533
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:18,778
this was a task assigned to me.

534
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:20,488
A task?

535
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,615
The person who killed your wife

536
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:23,824
might have…

537
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:26,869
killed my aunt too.

538
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,498
To solve what you weren't able to,

539
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:32,583
please help me.

540
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:37,046
This is driving me crazy.
What are they saying?

541
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:43,386
Help you with what?

542
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:44,303
By any chance,

543
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:46,806
do you suspect anyone else besides me?

544
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:49,767
Why do I have to tell you that?

545
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:52,144
I still don't believe
your ridiculous words

546
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:53,938
and have no intention of believing them!

547
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:57,775
I was at the scene
the night Ko Na-heun died.

548
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:00,319
You met the culprit?

549
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:01,737
I didn't see their face.

550
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:05,574
But I'm sure the culprit saw mine.

551
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:08,577
I know it's ridiculous.

552
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:10,288
And I know it's hard to believe.

553
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:11,372
But…

554
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:16,043
I could be the next target.

555
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:18,587
Mr. Baek.

556
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:21,090
I don't have any time left.

557
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:24,260
Please, help me!

558
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:29,056
He definitely reacted.

559
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,516
What do you think she said?

560
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:32,393
Who knows?

561
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:35,521
Whatever it was, I'm sure
it's something we can't know about.

562
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:38,983
Will he talk?

563
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:41,485
We have to do what we can to make him.

564
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:01,922
As you can see,
she meets with her niece behind the house.

565
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:04,592
I don't know why.
But they don't go in together.

566
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,385
Any pictures of them together?

567
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:07,428
None.

568
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,430
They move separately.

569
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:12,558
I'm sure the two of them
are up to something.

570
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:14,685
These are Lim Sun's blood test results.

571
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:17,938
BLOOD TEST RESULTS
LIM SUN

572
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:20,816
BLOOD TYPE
A POSITIVE

573
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,068
PATIENT NAME
LIM SUN

574
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:23,611
O POSITIVE

575
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:26,739
If the person who killed

576
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:29,784
Ko Na-heun and your wife
is the same person,

577
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:31,994
I can find them.

578
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:37,666
I promise I'll catch them.

579
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:14,161
Is your friend okay?

580
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,580
Are you talking about Mi-jin?

581
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:19,625
She's always happy.

582
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:22,503
What a relief.

583
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:26,048
To be honest, kidnapping victims
experience a lot of trauma.

584
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:28,884
Since you two are close like sisters,

585
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:30,636
I'm sure Mi-jin already told you.

586
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:33,013
But make sure you give her a lot of help.

587
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,473
Gosh, on that day,

588
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:36,642
if it weren't for Mr. Gye,
it would've been--

589
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:38,644
Just terrible. Right.

590
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:41,230
I know.

591
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:44,733
Are you okay?

592
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,445
So you're saying,

593
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:49,822
just like how we see on TV,

594
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:53,033
Mi-jin had been kidnapped, right?

595
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:55,286
Yes, that's right.

596
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:00,916
Right.

597
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:23,647
Where are you?

598
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:25,774
Come to my house right now!

599
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,360
Never mind. Hey.

600
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:30,654
It's late, so just stay there.

601
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:31,655
I'll come to you.

602
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:37,244
Hey, Ga-yeong.

603
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:40,748
-You bring the food containers?
-I'll bring them next time.

604
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:42,708
I made more food, so take it when you go.

605
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:43,626
Okay.

606
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,259
Hey.

607
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:57,097
Hey! What's wrong with you? Hey!

608
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:00,226
What's with you? What?

609
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,983
Wait. Why are you crying?

610
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:10,903
What is it? Did something happen?

611
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:15,241
-I heard you were kidnapped.
-What?

612
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:17,535
I heard you were kidnapped, you idiot!

613
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:19,620
No, don't!

614
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:20,996
No.

615
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,373
No. Wait.

616
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:23,791
What are you two doing?

617
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:27,169
-Is Ga-yeong staying for dinner?
-Yeah, she is!

618
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:28,879
Hey, Ga-yeong.

619
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:31,090
Ga-yeong.

620
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:33,509
Hey, where did you hear that?

621
00:42:33,592 --> 00:42:34,426
Mi-jin…

622
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:37,346
Why didn't you tell me?

623
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,685
I didn't even know, like a crazy bitch.

624
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:44,895
Hey.

625
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:48,857
How could you do this to me?

626
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:53,153
I didn't know what had happened to you.

627
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:56,407
I didn't even know anything.

628
00:42:57,032 --> 00:42:59,785
I'm really sorry.

629
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:03,163
Are you okay? Are you?

630
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:06,000
You should've told me!

631
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:08,294
I'm so sorry.

632
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:10,421
I'm sorry.

633
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:12,298
Are you really okay?

634
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:13,674
Yeah, I'm okay.

635
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:16,385
I didn't get hurt at all.
I'm completely fine.

636
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:19,305
I'm going to kill that bastard!

637
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:24,059
Hold on.

638
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:25,311
Okay.

639
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:27,855
You crazy bitch! You should've told me!

640
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:32,526
I'll snap his neck!
I'll make him beg for mercy!

641
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:36,155
Okay.

642
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:38,824
I didn't know how sad this show was!

643
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:42,786
All right. Okay. I get it.

644
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:45,164
I'm so sorry.

645
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:52,004
I'm just really curious.

646
00:43:52,087 --> 00:43:53,756
Why do you keep coming to my house?

647
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:57,426
You think I came for no reason at all?

648
00:43:57,509 --> 00:44:00,179
-Yes.
-I have a family, and I'm very busy.

649
00:44:00,262 --> 00:44:01,680
But despite all of that,

650
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:04,975
you're overwhelmed with work,
so I came to help you.

651
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:07,227
-You don't even help.
-Do you have any beer?

652
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:10,314
-I don't.
-But I'm thirsty.

653
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:12,066
I don't have anything!

654
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:16,862
There's no soju either!

655
00:44:16,945 --> 00:44:18,489
I'm tired, so just go.

656
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:20,115
Right now?

657
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:21,492
I have to work.

658
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:23,661
Wait a second.

659
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:25,537
I need to use your bathroom.

660
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:28,123
Jeez.

661
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:30,668
What's wrong with him?

662
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:33,045
MY DEAR WIFE

663
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:38,676
Your phone's ringing!

664
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:45,140
Your wife's calling.

665
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:48,852
No.

666
00:44:49,311 --> 00:44:50,896
No!

667
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:06,954
This is a special deal
for only our VIP customers!

668
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:08,997
Change cell phones now

669
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:12,668
and receive up to 500,000 won!

670
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:15,045
You'll never see a deal like this again!

671
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:19,383
What was that?

672
00:45:19,466 --> 00:45:21,885
Why did you save
a spam call as your wife?

673
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:23,554
Well…

674
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:28,434
What is it?

675
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:30,018
What's wrong?

676
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:32,438
What? What's the matter?

677
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:34,022
What is it? Tell me.

678
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:35,899
No, it's too embarrassing.

679
00:45:36,733 --> 00:45:37,776
Gosh.

680
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:43,532
Wait, so the marriage was a sham…

681
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:44,658
No.

682
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:48,078
There was no wedding
or marriage certificate.

683
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:50,122
She just stole your money and ran.

684
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:52,082
So you were literally scammed.

685
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:54,126
Wow.

686
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:57,254
She must've been really good
to have duped an investigator.

687
00:45:57,337 --> 00:45:58,338
Thanks to her,

688
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:01,508
when victims come to testify
with desperation in their hearts,

689
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:02,551
I kind of… No.

690
00:46:02,634 --> 00:46:04,928
I fully understand how they feel.

691
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:08,599
I've channeled my pain into my work ethic.

692
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:13,061
But you passed out
those wedding invitations.

693
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:16,607
Wait, what did you do
with the congratulatory money I sent?

694
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:17,900
Give it back now.

695
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:20,986
-How could you say that to a scam victim?
-I'm a victim too!

696
00:46:21,069 --> 00:46:23,822
You always used your wife
or mother-in-law as an excuse!

697
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:27,409
You shouldn't lie so much.
You work for the government.

698
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:31,622
Once you start lying about a few things,
it becomes pretty easy.

699
00:46:31,705 --> 00:46:32,748
Jeez.

700
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:35,334
So how much did you lose?

701
00:46:35,417 --> 00:46:37,127
Not much. Just the house deposit.

702
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:41,465
What?

703
00:46:41,548 --> 00:46:42,633
Are you crazy?

704
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:46,053
I have the cheapest studio apartment
in my building,

705
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:48,096
so it's freezing in the winter.

706
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:50,599
And I can't keep staying at a bathhouse.

707
00:46:51,266 --> 00:46:52,643
Do you have an extra room?

708
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:54,645
What extra room? Look for yourself.

709
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:56,563
No way!

710
00:46:58,857 --> 00:47:02,194
I have no home.
You're not going to kick me out, are you?

711
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:04,780
I didn't hear him. Nope.

712
00:47:09,826 --> 00:47:11,328
Can you turn up the heater?

713
00:47:14,456 --> 00:47:16,291
No, never mind. This is perfect.

714
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:17,209
Wow.

715
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:18,794
It's so warm.

716
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:20,462
What do I do?

717
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:24,007
You didn't change after sunset?

718
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:26,051
-No.
-Isn't that a good thing?

719
00:47:28,845 --> 00:47:29,680
Of course not.

720
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:34,935
That means you're slowly spending
more time as Lim Sun.

721
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:38,021
I didn't change
for a while after sunset.

722
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:42,234
Luckily, it's not something
that always happens.

723
00:47:42,317 --> 00:47:44,319
So I didn't get caught this time, but…

724
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,282
Then, what happens now?

725
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:53,704
After that…

726
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:56,331
-I checked the times.
-Okay.

727
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:59,334
The amount of time
not changing even after sunset

728
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:00,502
has gradually…

729
00:48:02,462 --> 00:48:03,297
increased.

730
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:08,051
Then, are you saying
you could completely change into Lim Sun?

731
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:10,846
Maybe.

732
00:48:12,097 --> 00:48:13,807
No way.

733
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:17,144
We can't be sitting here like this.
Shouldn't we do something?

734
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:22,149
Yeah, we have to do something,
but we can't find even the cat.

735
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:24,276
Or maybe

736
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:26,820
it wasn't because of the cat
to begin with.

737
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:31,491
Or maybe you'll change
if we catch the culprit?

738
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:32,659
The culprit?

739
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:34,703
In TV shows and movies,

740
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:37,164
things change
at the end of a dramatic event.

741
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:39,666
So that crazy killer…

742
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:42,044
Yeah, if you help catch that crazy killer,

743
00:48:42,127 --> 00:48:42,961
then who knows?

744
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:45,672
The heavens may be moved
to lift this curse.

745
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:51,845
Even if that's not the case,
you're just going to give up and grow old?

746
00:48:51,928 --> 00:48:53,472
We have to try something.

747
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:10,947
Jeez.

748
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:14,618
Gosh.

749
00:49:15,952 --> 00:49:20,165
Right. I can't keep
hiding like this forever.

750
00:49:20,248 --> 00:49:22,709
But what if they can't catch the culprit?

751
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:25,295
Do I have to live in anxiety

752
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:27,172
for the rest of my life?

753
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:34,930
SEOHAN CITY SUNSET TIME

754
00:49:35,013 --> 00:49:38,433
SUNRISE TIME 6:25 A.M.
SUNSET TIME 6:25 P.M.

755
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:01,623
What in the world?

756
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:02,541
No way!

757
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:03,709
What is it now?

758
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:06,336
Omurice was for dinner a few days ago,

759
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,296
but it's omurice again tonight.
I'm sick of it.

760
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:10,590
Then, just eat out. Why get angry over it?

761
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:12,134
-Let's go.
-Okay.

762
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:14,052
Come with us.

763
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:16,304
I'm not hungry. Go without me.

764
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:17,431
Do you want takeout?

765
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:18,765
No, it's fine.

766
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,434
-We'll be back.
-Okay.

767
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:48,003
Enjoy your meal.

768
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:52,174
Do you know

769
00:50:52,257 --> 00:50:54,217
what's even sadder

770
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:55,594
than losing that money?

771
00:50:55,677 --> 00:50:56,678
I'm not curious.

772
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:59,264
The pain of losing someone you love.

773
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:03,477
That's what makes it
an even tougher time.

774
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:06,229
But it was one-sided,
so what's the point? She was fake.

775
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:07,689
I just can't talk to you.

776
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:09,232
Then, hurry and go to bed.

777
00:51:09,816 --> 00:51:11,985
It was real love for me, okay?

778
00:51:12,068 --> 00:51:14,821
Jeez. Fine. It was real love.

779
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:23,205
Eat up. I'm sure you feel
pretty sick to your stomach.

780
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:29,169
Did…

781
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:31,379
Did I do something foolish last night?

782
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:32,380
Something foolish?

783
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:34,841
Well, nothing really foolish.

784
00:51:37,844 --> 00:51:40,388
But I did realize something thanks to you.

785
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:43,225
Don't let people
with bad drunk habits into your home.

786
00:51:43,308 --> 00:51:44,184
Especially,

787
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:46,311
people with sob stories.

788
00:51:46,394 --> 00:51:47,938
I realized they were hopeless.

789
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:50,023
"Never associate with them."
Things like that.

790
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:51,608
Yeah.

791
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:54,152
But that wasn't the case,

792
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:56,154
so relax and eat.

793
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:57,739
You scared me. That's not me.

794
00:51:57,823 --> 00:52:00,492
I'd never do that. I have my act together.

795
00:52:00,575 --> 00:52:01,451
But…

796
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:02,994
I did realize something.

797
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:06,039
In a good way.

798
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:09,042
That's why I decided

799
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:10,585
that if…

800
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:14,923
if I actually fell in love
with someone again,

801
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:17,425
I would be so good to them.

802
00:52:18,009 --> 00:52:19,928
Why would you end up at that decision?

803
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:22,013
Wouldn't the normal answer be

804
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:24,432
you'd never fall in love
or trust women again?

805
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:30,146
For someone like you
who's optimized for living alone,

806
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:31,815
what would you know?

807
00:52:31,898 --> 00:52:33,650
You don't know anything, Mr. Gye.

808
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:37,821
The pain of losing the one you love.

809
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:42,075
The helplessness
of being able to do nothing.

810
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:43,827
And…

811
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:47,122
the fear of ending up alone.

812
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:53,378
You would never know what that feels like.

813
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:56,506
I know it too.

814
00:52:58,925 --> 00:53:00,760
I've never told you this before…

815
00:53:03,179 --> 00:53:05,473
but I never want to go through

816
00:53:06,391 --> 00:53:07,517
losing someone again…

817
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:10,145
Are you asleep?

818
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:13,398
Jeez.

819
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:15,984
Don't sleep like that.

820
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:38,089
You scared me!

821
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:39,049
Jeez!

822
00:53:41,843 --> 00:53:43,261
I can finally take my first bite.

823
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:58,693
SEOHAN PROVINCIAL POLICE AGENCY

824
00:54:25,887 --> 00:54:28,932
What if you came to the station
as a witness, got exposed,

825
00:54:29,015 --> 00:54:30,100
and became a target?

826
00:54:30,183 --> 00:54:32,060
The sun doesn't stop murderers.

827
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:34,854
I've been digging and searching
for over 20 years.

828
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:36,940
"Why did Lim Sun disappear?"

829
00:54:37,023 --> 00:54:39,109
"For what reason?"

830
00:54:39,192 --> 00:54:42,112
"What happened right after she met me?"

831
00:54:42,195 --> 00:54:44,489
If Baek Cheol-gyu isn't the culprit,

832
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:46,658
then who is?

833
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:48,368
Who is it?

834
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:21,961
Are you okay?

835
00:56:26,257 --> 00:56:27,383
It's okay.

836
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:28,343
I'm here now.

837
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:32,430
I'll trust you, so keep your promise.

838
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:36,976
I prepared your meal,
so make sure you eat.

839
00:56:50,865 --> 00:56:51,783
Hello, Detective Kwon.

840
00:56:52,367 --> 00:56:53,201
Mr. Gye,

841
00:56:53,284 --> 00:56:56,621
Ms. Lee Mi-jin is here,
and she wants to give a statement

842
00:56:56,704 --> 00:56:58,331
in regards to Ko Na-heun's case.

843
00:56:58,414 --> 00:56:59,916
A statement?

844
00:56:59,999 --> 00:57:03,586
But she's asking to meet
Baek Cheol-gyu first.

845
00:57:04,212 --> 00:57:05,088
What should I do?

846
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:07,507
I'll be right there, so just wait.

847
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:26,651
Maybe you'll change
if we catch the culprit?

848
00:57:26,734 --> 00:57:27,819
The culprit?

849
00:57:27,902 --> 00:57:30,905
If you help catch that crazy killer,

850
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:31,990
then who knows?

851
00:57:32,073 --> 00:57:34,909
The heavens may be moved
to lift this curse.

852
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:01,102
Let's go.

853
00:58:01,853 --> 00:58:02,687
Wait a second.

854
00:58:04,772 --> 00:58:05,982
No, wait.

855
00:58:09,777 --> 00:58:11,779
Mr. Gye, wait. Please?

856
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:19,621
I said let go!

857
00:58:19,704 --> 00:58:21,998
Are you insane? Why would you come here?

858
00:58:22,081 --> 00:58:23,791
Just hiding won't solve this.

859
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:28,046
If I tell them I'm a witness,

860
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:30,632
it could help the investigation.

861
00:58:30,715 --> 00:58:32,342
What if Baek isn't the culprit?

862
00:58:32,425 --> 00:58:35,470
What if that damn killer
is still out there?

863
00:58:35,553 --> 00:58:37,430
What will you do if they find you?

864
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:39,390
That's why we don't have time!

865
00:58:39,474 --> 00:58:41,184
I told you I'd catch them!

866
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:46,147
I told you I'd do whatever it takes
to catch them.

867
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:53,947
But you haven't caught them yet.

868
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:08,753
I'm sorry.

869
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:10,672
I should trust you.

870
00:59:11,422 --> 00:59:13,591
I wanted to trust you and wait,

871
00:59:15,677 --> 00:59:17,345
but I'm so scared.

872
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:20,265
I couldn't just sit at home
and do nothing.

873
00:59:30,858 --> 00:59:32,318
I promise I'll catch them.

874
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:36,489
I'll never let someone I care about

875
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:38,700
disappear again.

876
00:59:57,302 --> 00:59:58,595
I'm sorry I was late.

877
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:01,347
I'm late in catching the culprit

878
01:00:02,515 --> 01:00:05,268
and in realizing my feelings for you.
I'm sorry for everything.

879
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:36,609
MISS NIGHT AND DAY

880
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:39,529
I didn't come because I was worried.
When I come and see you,

881
01:01:39,612 --> 01:01:41,948
I don't have to look for you in my dreams.

882
01:01:45,451 --> 01:01:47,787
We're sitting together,
but why do I feel so lonely?

883
01:01:49,163 --> 01:01:51,040
To be honest,
there's someone else I like.

884
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:52,083
It doesn't matter.

885
01:01:52,166 --> 01:01:53,459
She has a crush?

886
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:55,420
-Want to get a drink after--
-Damn it!

887
01:01:55,503 --> 01:01:58,589
You said you don't know
where she works or what she does.

888
01:01:58,673 --> 01:01:59,882
-Who's that lady?
-Look!

889
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:03,261
But Gong Eun-sim's a woman.
Gong Gi-cheol's a man.

890
01:02:03,344 --> 01:02:04,846
No, she's a woman.

891
01:02:06,973 --> 01:02:08,141
Ms. Lim?

892
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:10,351
Who in the world are you?

893
01:02:14,439 --> 01:02:19,068
