00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:45,962
MISS NIGHT AND DAY

2
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:04,939
What happened?

3
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,441
There's no time to explain.

4
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:15,116
Hello, 911?

5
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,911
Someone has fainted here.
Can you please hurry?

6
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:20,330
Okay.

7
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:38,431
HWADONG MEDICAL CENTER

8
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:58,284
What were you two doing there?

9
00:01:58,368 --> 00:01:59,911
Why did she suddenly faint?

10
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,497
I didn't know you knew each other.

11
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,249
I could say the same.

12
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:05,959
We met at work.

13
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:09,170
Work? What type of work?

14
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:12,298
I don't think I need to tell you that.

15
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,300
Then, she fainted while working?

16
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:16,719
There must be a reason.

17
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:37,490
Chu!

18
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:46,207
CEO

19
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:58,261
Why do I think this situation
seems to have something to do with you?

20
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,140
What if it doesn't?

21
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,184
-Would you believe me?
-It better not.

22
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:09,063
If you're involved, I'll make things
very difficult for you.

23
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:10,982
It won't compare to last time.

24
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,821
Doctor.

25
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,835
She fainted,
but you're still not attending to her?

26
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,087
You should at least explain
what happened.

27
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:34,422
Didn't you hear?

28
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:35,965
About what?

29
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:43,181
Her white blood cell count
was unusually high in her blood test.

30
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:47,602
If she has no underlying conditions,
I suspect she took too much medication.

31
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:52,440
Overconsumption of anxiety medication
can cause side effects like drowsiness.

32
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:54,400
So she's sleeping right now?

33
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,236
We'll run tests when she wakes up.

34
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,029
So let's talk more in detail then.

35
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,035
Anxiety medication?

36
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:10,208
Where are you right now?

37
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,044
-The hospital.
-The hospital?

38
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:14,170
Which hospital?

39
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,382
Did you split the pills with her?

40
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:19,467
How generous of you!

41
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:22,845
No, I didn't mean to give them to her.
I was going to take them.

42
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:24,889
They were just anxiety meds.

43
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:27,225
Anxiety meds are drugs too!
Are you crazy?

44
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:30,061
Of course, I am.
Why else would I take them?

45
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:35,149
Then, we'll say this.

46
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,777
You never tried to take anxiety meds.

47
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,530
No, you were never even there. Got it?

48
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:41,823
What are you saying?

49
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:43,866
She just fainted on her own, okay?

50
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,285
If you just keep quiet…

51
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,372
She won't know why she passed out.

52
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:50,665
Are you crazy?

53
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,005
She passed out after taking my drugs.

54
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:58,840
They weren't anxiety meds, were they?

55
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:03,219
Are you crazy?

56
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:06,556
Was it temporary insanity again?
What's your excuse this time?

57
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,266
Was it because the suspect died?

58
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,727
Don't bring others down with you.

59
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:13,146
Leave innocent people alone.

60
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:15,523
I was just…

61
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:17,317
I was going to take them but…

62
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:22,655
Mi-jin, are you okay?

63
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,366
What? What happened?

64
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,701
Give this to me.

65
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:28,953
-Wait…
-Gosh.

66
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,205
No one was there.

67
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:32,707
-This hurts.
-Why did you come out?

68
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,292
My head hurts.

69
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:37,754
INFORMATION
HWADONG MEDICAL CENTER

70
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,840
-Mr. Gye, I'll--
-Are you still…

71
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,384
Are you really dizzy?

72
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,262
I'm fine.

73
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:49,849
I'm sorry.

74
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:51,976
Can we talk?

75
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:53,853
You haven't recovered.

76
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:55,855
You can't be discharged yet.

77
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:58,691
Do you know why you fainted?
Or why you lost consciousness?

78
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:09,285
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

79
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:10,328
I'll take you home.

80
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:13,790
No, I can go alone.

81
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,958
-But you're not well.
-Thank you.

82
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:44,487
Get in.

83
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,156
I didn't come for a ride. We need to talk.

84
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:57,917
Get in. We can talk on the way.

85
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,836
No, let's talk now.

86
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:05,550
Explain what you said to me earlier.

87
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,219
I know I heard you correctly.

88
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:11,931
The sun will set soon.

89
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,560
Don't move or you might get caught.

90
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,646
What did you mean?

91
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,234
Do you really know everything?

92
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:38,833
Don't worry. I'll keep your secret.

93
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,174
How did you find out?

94
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,931
Tell me right now! How did you find out?

95
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:58,686
I kept watching you.

96
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:09,131
Should we get started?

97
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:25,690
I want to eat some good food

98
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:36,534
What was that?

99
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:38,828
This doesn't make sense.

100
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:48,462
I'll keep your secret.

101
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:52,717
Ma'am…

102
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,429
I mean, you.

103
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,848
You kept my secret too.

104
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,685
I'll keep your secret,

105
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:04,687
so you can trust me.

106
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:17,408
Mi-jin!

107
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:18,451
I have to go.

108
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:20,661
You can't just leave…

109
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:21,579
Hey!

110
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,916
-Who's that?
-Don't look. It's three years bad luck.

111
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,001
-I mean it.
-Okay.

112
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:28,878
-I'm not lying.
-Are you okay though?

113
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:31,672
-Hey, don't look!
-Okay. Hold tight.

114
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:49,732
I'll keep your secret.

115
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:52,693
So you can trust me.

116
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,304
-Damn it.
-What is it?

117
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:22,556
Did you sprain something?

118
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:24,392
What's wrong with my body?

119
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:27,061
Hey, after eight years
of studying for civil service exams,

120
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:30,106
all you had
was your stubborn will and stamina.

121
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:31,899
So what's with you?

122
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:35,236
I know, but my body feels strange.

123
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:36,320
What is it?

124
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:39,782
Wasn't it just your face that aged?
Your stamina was fine.

125
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:42,034
-I know. That's what I thought.
-Right.

126
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,328
Could I have been wrong?

127
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,206
Don't overdo it! Take it easy.

128
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:49,291
-It's okay. Sit down.
-Okay.

129
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:56,799
Come on.

130
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:58,801
Stop scaring me.

131
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:00,428
Hey.

132
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:04,640
What if I keep aging like this and die--

133
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:06,684
Seriously, stop it!

134
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:08,561
Okay.

135
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:13,399
Forget it.
Just think about finding that cat.

136
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:16,777
I'm going to hang a huge banner
at the intersection tomorrow.

137
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,696
Okay, thanks.

138
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:24,827
It's so weird.

139
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,207
Hey, what's with you?

140
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,003
-Well?
-Are you okay?

141
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,087
Yeah.

142
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:37,756
-It'll be okay.
-Yeah.

143
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,925
-Don't worry.
-Okay.

144
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:47,808
It's right.

145
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:51,187
Mr. Jeong, have them delivered right away.

146
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,022
I'll deposit the money tonight.

147
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,440
Don't be late again.

148
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,401
-What?
-I waited because I trust you.

149
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:58,736
I don't normally do this.

150
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:00,321
What are you talking about?

151
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:03,157
My daughter said
she deposited it right away that night.

152
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,743
"Seohan Provincial Police Agency"?

153
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:08,370
You must've been mistaken.

154
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,956
Do I need to show you
that it was deposited today?

155
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,958
What's with all the chatter?

156
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:17,129
I mean, let's go if you're done.

157
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:18,589
-Bye, Mr. Jeong.
-Bye.

158
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,176
Wait, honey. Let go.

159
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:23,886
He must've been mistaken.

160
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,971
Mi-jin wouldn't have deposited it late.

161
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,932
Well, that's what I'm saying.

162
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:32,436
She's just like you.
She's so upright and stubborn.

163
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,147
She wouldn't steal
a single cent from anyone.

164
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,398
She'd never deposit it late.

165
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,526
Exactly, and he got the money.

166
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:41,153
What's left to talk about?
Don't be so stubborn.

167
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,447
I'll just do it myself from now on.

168
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,698
Yeah.

169
00:13:57,711 --> 00:14:00,965
MY FATHER DISAPPEARED! PLEASE FIND HIM!
PLEASE CALL IF YOU SAW HIM

170
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,641
Did her father work here?

171
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:13,227
Why is she doing that here?

172
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:15,479
Ms. Lim.

173
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:21,527
Ms. Lim?

174
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,369
Ms. Lim?

175
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,329
-Ms. Lim!
-My goodness!

176
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:35,416
Mr. Gye's been calling you,
but you weren't answering.

177
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:37,543
-Yes, sir?
-Are you feeling okay?

178
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:38,878
You don't look so good.

179
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,212
I'm fine.

180
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,089
Is something the matter?

181
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:44,884
The attachment was missing
from the email you sent yesterday.

182
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,343
I'm so sorry.

183
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:47,970
I'll print it out for you now.

184
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,221
Okay, take your time.

185
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,351
Thank you.

186
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,861
NUMBER 35, 6438, SUV, GRAY
HWADONG MEDICAL CENTER

187
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,866
Didn't you say the former director

188
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:10,951
of Hwadong Medical Center
works here?

189
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,078
-Director Baek Cheol-gyu?
-Yes.

190
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,789
How long has he worked here now?

191
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:17,499
It's been two weeks.

192
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,879
The sulfuric acid attack
occurred here on October 16.

193
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:25,257
Baek Cheol-gyu was hired
as a senior public intern on October 23.

194
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:26,967
One week apart.

195
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:28,886
Excuse me.

196
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:33,182
After Ko Na-heun left,
he came as his replacement.

197
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:36,644
It hasn't been that long,
but someone has already quit?

198
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:39,063
He was terminated
for being absent without notice.

199
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,358
After the incident,
he joined the prosecutors' office

200
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,068
as an absent employee's replacement?

201
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:48,656
Is something the matter
with Director Baek Cheol-gyu?

202
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:51,158
-We need to find out.
-Excuse me.

203
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:53,035
Can I look into it by any chance?

204
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:56,664
-What?
-I've lived in this town for a while.

205
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,874
I know Hwadong Medical Center pretty well.

206
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,002
We're both senior public interns,
so we can easily become acquainted.

207
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,671
We'd be grateful.

208
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,673
I understand you want to work hard.

209
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,716
But you almost passed out last time.

210
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,426
Please refrain from other tasks.

211
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:15,557
Yes, sir.

212
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,444
Jeez, I was hoisted by my own petard.
Serves me right.

213
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,655
After using pain as an excuse
to get out of trouble,

214
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:32,408
I get special treatment
for being old and sick now.

215
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,201
Jeez.

216
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:41,333
Sun!

217
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,881
What? Why is she running away?
Sun! Your coffee!

218
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:50,092
-What?
-Go away!

219
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,176
Your iced coffee!

220
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,262
What? Where are you going?

221
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,723
What in the world did he see?

222
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,308
Why do you keep following me? Why?

223
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,061
Sun, stop!

224
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,022
Come on!

225
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,566
Jeez, stop!

226
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:07,651
Are you going to avoid me forever?

227
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,136
Aren't you happy that I know?

228
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,555
I can help you.

229
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:37,681
How can you help?

230
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,435
Can you release me from this damn curse?

231
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:53,530
First,

232
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:54,990
sell me your coupon.

233
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:56,909
What coupon?

234
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,286
Mr. Cha's wish coupon.

235
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:17,721
Okay, smile!

236
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,848
One, two, three!

237
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:25,104
I'll buy it for 500,000 won.

238
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:27,314
Excuse me! What do you take me for?

239
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:29,149
Okay, one million won.

240
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,111
Gifts shouldn't be bought
or sold for money.

241
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:34,279
Three million won.

242
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,491
MONEY LOST FROM SCAM
SELL GAME ITEMS AND COUPON

243
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:38,659
PRETTY MUCH PAID OFF

244
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:40,661
Sold to the highest bid!

245
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,412
Transfer complete!

246
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,876
But what are you going to do with that?

247
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:57,386
WISH COUPON
ISSUED BY CHA JAE-SEONG

248
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:58,637
Why do you have this?

249
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,847
It was handed over to me.

250
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,056
It was?

251
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,225
This isn't something you can hand over.

252
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,018
That's not written on there.

253
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:09,231
And it's against the Fair Trade Act
to not recognize issued coupons.

254
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:11,066
"Not recognize"?

255
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:14,278
An unconditional wish coupon.
Was it a false promise?

256
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:17,990
When did I ever say
it was unconditional? Come on!

257
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:19,950
You did though.

258
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:22,035
Excuse me. Didn't he say that?

259
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,954
-Yes, he did.
-Excuse me?

260
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,921
Yeah, fine! So what's your wish then?

261
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:34,339
Goodness.

262
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:38,135
I'll be your assistant secretary.

263
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:40,470
-What?
-Assistant secretary.

264
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:42,014
I don't have a secretary.

265
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,933
I heard a busy office clerk
does your secretarial work.

266
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,188
I'll do it for you.

267
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,355
Jeez!

268
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:51,398
Who said that?

269
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:52,566
Did Ms. Kim say that?

270
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:54,610
That she's busy
but I gave her secretary duties?

271
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:55,694
No, she didn't.

272
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:58,780
But I'm sure the other clerks
don't want to do the work.

273
00:19:58,864 --> 00:19:59,907
Look.

274
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:03,952
Not only do we not have
an assistant secretary position here--

275
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,287
Come on.

276
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,956
You have an office aide,
so why not an assistant secretary?

277
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,167
-I want to do it.
-For goodness' sake.

278
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,462
Also, I've been going on two hours
of sleep a day since I was a trainee.

279
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,088
So being really busy doesn't faze me.

280
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:16,924
Listen!

281
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,967
I'm saying this makes me uncomfortable!

282
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,637
Don't you think it's wrong
to be stubborn about…

283
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:26,225
No matter what.

284
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:29,228
Wow, what a complete lunatic.

285
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,444
That'll be 13,000 won.

286
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,572
Do a lot of Hwadong Medical patients
come here?

287
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:43,408
They'd go to convenience stores,
not mom-and-pop stores.

288
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:44,910
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

289
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:47,788
I heard the director there
was pretty strange though.

290
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:49,498
Goodness, who said that?

291
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:53,377
He's a very mild-mannered gentleman.

292
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,046
He treats so many sick children.

293
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:58,924
-Where does it hurt?
-Some of the elderly can't afford care.

294
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,093
So he goes and treats them for free.

295
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:03,011
There's no one else like him.

296
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,596
Looking at your medical chart…

297
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:06,848
I see.

298
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:08,809
So he's a good man.

299
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:09,935
Have a great day.

300
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:11,311
Tell me if you need more.

301
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:12,396
-Okay.
-Okay.

302
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:15,482
Okay, please enjoy these cold drinks.

303
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:16,650
Thank you.

304
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:20,070
So when did the director's wife die again?

305
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:23,031
I think it's been about 20 years, right?

306
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,742
There was a lot of commotion
around the town then.

307
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,244
There was so much talk.

308
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:29,579
Did something happen?

309
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:33,834
Find out what you can
about Baek Cheol-gyu.

310
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:37,421
You suspect this 6438 car you saw
at the scene was the culprit?

311
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:40,507
They fled after seeing me,
so it means they know me.

312
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:43,510
Even if they're not the culprit,
they're at least involved.

313
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:45,262
After his wife died,

314
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:49,599
he was so upset that he tried
to follow her into the afterlife.

315
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:51,852
He fell severely ill overnight,

316
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:53,895
and he even quit being a doctor.

317
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,898
He quit the hospital
after his wife passed.

318
00:21:57,482 --> 00:22:00,902
But he started going around
with a big bag to help people.

319
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:05,157
For him, helping other people
is the only joy he has.

320
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,325
That's right.

321
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:10,912
He's too clean.

322
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,332
-Hello, Dr. Baek.
-Hi, how are you?

323
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:21,965
Why are you telling me
about what your subordinate did?

324
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:25,052
Do whatever you can to take care of it.

325
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:26,970
That way we'll both be in the clear.

326
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:37,064
I'm about to take the fall for everything!

327
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:40,025
Before I expose
why you tried to kill that person,

328
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:41,526
handle it now.

329
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:57,375
CLEAN UP YOUR OWN MESS

330
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:26,113
Are you okay?

331
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,866
You've been standing here for days.
You'll pass out like this.

332
00:23:30,408 --> 00:23:32,994
It'll be bad if you become dehydrated.
Come with me.

333
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:35,038
Your bag.

334
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,877
Your father worked
at the prosecutors' office

335
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:42,629
before he went missing?

336
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:45,298
My dad…

337
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:49,469
He took care of me for over 20 years
with his injured leg.

338
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:54,474
He always made sure
I never ate dinner alone.

339
00:23:57,352 --> 00:23:59,062
He said he wasn't a good enough father,

340
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,898
so he couldn't do anything for me.

341
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:05,277
That's why

342
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:09,447
he'd always personally prepare
dinner for me.

343
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:10,907
I'm just happy

344
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:14,744
to at least have a chance
to work like this.

345
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:17,622
The dinner was canceled.

346
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:19,249
On my way home,

347
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:20,792
I'll buy you something tasty.

348
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:23,879
I'll make your favorite,
beef soybean paste stew.

349
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,213
Hurry home.

350
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,773
Dad, where are you?

351
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:58,455
The person you are trying to call
is unavailable.

352
00:24:58,538 --> 00:24:59,915
Leave a message after the tone.

353
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:02,626
Dad, where are you?

354
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:05,003
Why is your phone off?

355
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:07,297
Should I come get you?

356
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,382
Dad, I'm worried.

357
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:12,177
Text me back when you see this, okay?

358
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:15,639
He wasn't able to get a job
because of his disability.

359
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:19,809
He was so happy to be working
at a prestigious prosecutors' office.

360
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:21,770
But why would he leave home?

361
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:25,815
I'll look into it.

362
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:28,443
By any chance,

363
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:31,238
could you tell me your father's name?

364
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:34,699
Ko Na-heun.

365
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,202
Ko Na-heun?

366
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:45,377
I think Ko Na-heun has gone missing.

367
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:50,715
How long has it been
since he's been out of contact?

368
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,842
Ever since he stopped coming to work.

369
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:54,135
Anything else of note?

370
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,888
No one's heard from him
since he said he got off work.

371
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,306
His phone's been off too.

372
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,976
There were no transactions
on his card either.

373
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:05,313
That means there's no sign
of everyday activities.

374
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:08,358
Do you think something bad
happened to him?

375
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:10,610
He's a grown adult. What could happen?

376
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:13,196
He's probably out somewhere playing cards.

377
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,239
You know,

378
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:18,410
there's one case
I've never been able to solve.

379
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:19,619
An unsolved case?

380
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:23,873
Cases of serial disappearances
in Seohan City.

381
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:27,127
Cases of serial disappearances
in Seohan City?

382
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:30,505
CASES OF SERIAL DISAPPEARANCES
IN SEOHAN CITY

383
00:26:30,588 --> 00:26:31,631
What is this?

384
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:36,761
Was that the same case?

385
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:40,557
In the end, the case died out
without any evidence.

386
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,852
There weren't any witnesses either?

387
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:45,937
Well, that's…

388
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:49,816
Tens of thousands of adults
are reported missing each year.

389
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:53,528
Maybe you're blowing it
out of proportion.

390
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:55,655
Unbelievable. What do you even know

391
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:59,617
about investigations
to talk about missing adults like that?

392
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:02,954
Why are you being angry at him?
It's not like he was wrong.

393
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:05,248
-What?
-It's true.

394
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:08,168
What would be the use
of carrying off a grown old man?

395
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:11,296
Well, you know what?

396
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,715
He probably ran away then!

397
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:24,392
Did he know when he asked me that?

398
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:28,229
It's about the person
who held this position before I did.

399
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,231
I was wondering why he quit.

400
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:31,900
By any chance…

401
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,985
Something didn't happen, did it?

402
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:44,037
Excuse me!

403
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:49,250
Why were they serial disappearances?

404
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:54,297
Well, right before they'd disappear,

405
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:55,840
there'd be a similar pattern.

406
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:58,093
-A pattern?
-Yeah.

407
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:00,887
They took out loans from banks,
withdrew from their savings,

408
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,305
settled their affairs,

409
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:04,391
and used their credit cards a bunch too.

410
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:07,060
They even borrowed money
from the people they knew.

411
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:09,646
I see, as if they were going to leave.

412
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:10,730
That's right.

413
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:12,107
On the surface.

414
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:14,192
Why do you suddenly ask?

415
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:15,902
Well, it's just…

416
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:19,197
I was wondering if someone I knew
was involved in that case.

417
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,325
-Someone you know?
-But it wasn't.

418
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:23,827
It wasn't a disappearance.

419
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:37,215
-Mom.
-Yes?

420
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:38,174
So…

421
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:42,387
Before Aunt Sun left home…

422
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:45,640
Why do you suddenly ask?

423
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,600
Did she use her credit cards

424
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:50,478
or borrow money from the bank?

425
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:53,231
Don't you know who your aunt is?

426
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:56,860
She worked at the bank
and never wasted any money.

427
00:28:58,319 --> 00:28:59,446
Right?

428
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:00,947
Why do you ask?

429
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,240
I was just wondering.

430
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:06,286
I'm sure she's doing fine.

431
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:09,247
Mom.

432
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:12,625
Aunt Sun's not missing, right?

433
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,086
That's right.

434
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:19,466
Didn't you hear what they said
at the police station?

435
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:20,592
She ran away.

436
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:23,595
The police said there was no way
she was missing.

437
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:25,054
Even if that were the case,

438
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:27,849
we looked everywhere for her.

439
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,480
Please take a look. She's my sister.

440
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:36,316
Please look at this.
She's my sister, Lim Sun.

441
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,402
Auntie.

442
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:40,570
I miss you.

443
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:41,613
Please.

444
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:45,742
Please take a look at this.
Her name's Lim Sun. She's my sister.

445
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:47,827
Help me find her. Please!

446
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,329
Could you take a close look?

447
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,372
Please take a look.

448
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:54,292
Take a look at this.

449
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:56,836
Could you take a look at this?

450
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:00,757
Please take a look at this.

451
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:03,510
She's my sister. Could you take a look?

452
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:07,305
Please take a look.

453
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,850
Just one look. Please.

454
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:12,894
Please look at this.

455
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:27,492
MISSING PERSON

456
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,848
Here's your favorite.

457
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,979
-You should've brought me soju.
-What?

458
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:57,105
Please.

459
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:59,315
You have dementia and diabetes.

460
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,067
How could you ask for that?

461
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:04,362
You don't even deserve that popsicle.
I'll give it to the ants.

462
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:05,822
Don't.

463
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,199
Jeez.

464
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:12,495
The thing is

465
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:14,747
someone I know has gone missing.

466
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:17,792
But something feels off about it.

467
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:20,336
Age?

468
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:24,132
Around 60 years old at least.

469
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:26,509
Personal details?

470
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,095
Nothing special,

471
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:31,472
aside from his bum leg.

472
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,433
He has a mild temperament too.

473
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:35,310
He isn't one to hold grudges.

474
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:36,561
When did he go missing?

475
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:39,188
Goodness, look at you.

476
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:40,982
The look in your eyes has changed.

477
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:42,942
You still think you're a detective?

478
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:47,989
Don't worry.

479
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:50,074
It's not a woman.

480
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:52,368
He's very old too.

481
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:55,204
I'm sure it's not what we're thinking.

482
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:59,918
In any case, search all of Daeho-ri
and the surrounding area.

483
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:02,879
Did you search
the field of reeds behind the mountain?

484
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:05,924
This won't do. I need to go.

485
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:08,343
Come on! Take it easy, will you?

486
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,053
Don't open another investigation

487
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:12,597
and make the squad suffer like last time!

488
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:17,268
-I'll go there.
-Hey, come on!

489
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:19,270
Good grief.

490
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:35,662
I'll tell you what I saw that night.

491
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:38,748
I'll tell you everything.

492
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:41,501
Okay. You made the right choice.
I'm on my way.

493
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:44,379
Okay.

494
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:46,172
-Hey, Jeong-ho.
-Yes, sir?

495
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:49,717
The chief called and said he got
into a crash at Hwadong Intersection.

496
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,469
Hurry and bring the chief here.

497
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:53,638
I have to go meet a witness though.

498
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:54,722
You punk.

499
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:57,392
Just tell the witness to come here!

500
00:32:57,475 --> 00:33:00,186
She was so nervous
that I barely talked her into it.

501
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:01,938
So we agreed to meet outside.

502
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:03,022
Here.

503
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:04,565
-I'll be back, sir.
-Are you kidding?

504
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:08,403
Hey, is a witness
more important than our chief?

505
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,154
Let's say you go meet the witness

506
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:13,074
and the chief gets hurt
while trying to return without help.

507
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:16,494
What would you do then? Are you going to
take responsibility, punk?

508
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,955
-Hey, Mal-tae.
-Yes, sir?

509
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:20,623
-Are you busy?
-Not at all, sir.

510
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:22,875
Detective No's on his way
to meet a witness.

511
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:24,335
But what do we do?

512
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:26,254
Something really urgent has come up.

513
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:28,423
Come on, sir!

514
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:31,300
It doesn't matter who goes.
We just need a statement!

515
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:33,386
A witness statement?

516
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,431
Sir, it was hard for me
to convince her.

517
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:39,267
I have to get her testimony
before she changes her mind.

518
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:43,312
In that case,
can't Mal-tae go and get the chief?

519
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:44,939
Don't be ridiculous. Shut it!

520
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:47,150
It's not hard at all.

521
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:49,110
-You can do it, right?
-Yes, sir.

522
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:50,194
Sir!

523
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:51,988
I have to tell him where she is!

524
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:53,281
Just follow me!

525
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:54,657
It's so cold.

526
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:00,371
Why is he so late?

527
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:03,875
I never should've said
I'd give a statement.

528
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:19,599
I won't say anything.
I didn't see anything.

529
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:21,309
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

530
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:31,027
Did she leave?

531
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,613
Darn it.

532
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:49,879
What's this?

533
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:50,797
Is this…

534
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:59,555
Hello? I think there's been
an accident here.

535
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:02,141
Yes. I think something's happened.

536
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:07,105
I didn't know either, okay?

537
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,272
I didn't know

538
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:10,942
things would turn out this way either!

539
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:14,403
Snap out of it!
Can you just give it a rest?

540
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:16,405
I'm exhausted, for crying out loud!

541
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,328
By the way, that woman…

542
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,456
The witness with a son.

543
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:28,501
I can't reach her.

544
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:29,544
Goodness.

545
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:31,379
This won't do.

546
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:33,506
I should go look for her.

547
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:36,008
She died!

548
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:39,178
She died a long time ago!

549
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:42,140
She disappeared years ago.

550
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:44,475
It'd be strange if she were still alive.

551
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:47,436
So don't do this anymore. Please.

552
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:52,191
Please let go of your guilt!
I'm begging you!

553
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:54,235
No, I have to

554
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:56,529
search the mountain behind
Hwadong Medical Center…

555
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,115
What are you doing? Want me to go alone?

556
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:00,449
Detective Seo, come on!

557
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:02,577
Call Yeong-sik too!

558
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,494
Hurry up!

559
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:05,079
Detective Seo!

560
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:08,166
-Yeong-sik! Come on!
-Please snap out of it!

561
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:09,083
Sir!

562
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,169
The field of reeds
behind Daeho-ri are thick!

563
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:13,004
We have to search thoroughly there!

564
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:17,592
Seriously?

565
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,553
You're the assistant secretary
for Mr. Cha now?

566
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:21,554
Yes.

567
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:22,471
Why?

568
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:27,310
Why would you spend three million
on a coupon to work there?

569
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,437
Wouldn't it be uncomfortable?

570
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,606
You couldn't pay me to do that job.

571
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:33,733
It's to keep my promise to you.

572
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:35,568
What did you say?

573
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:38,279
We're only a year apart.

574
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:42,158
By the way,

575
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:44,368
what's your promise to me?

576
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:45,411
What promise?

577
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,332
What is it?

578
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:52,543
What promise did we make?

579
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,255
Never mind.

580
00:36:57,757 --> 00:36:58,883
What?

581
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:01,052
You just said you did that because of me.

582
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:02,678
What is it?

583
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:14,982
Don't worry.

584
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:18,110
I'll stay here and protect you.

585
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,497
Here's the investigation report
from the prison.

586
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:38,798
"Complained of stomach pain before death."

587
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:41,342
Guard! Over here! Come quick!

588
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:44,971
Look at this. Are you insane? Jeez.

589
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:49,976
"The medical director administered
a sedative to treat the seizure."

590
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:52,520
Hold tight!

591
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:53,938
Hold him down now!

592
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:58,109
We know this already.
Is there anything else?

593
00:37:58,192 --> 00:38:00,653
A sedative was used to treat his seizure,

594
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:04,323
but there were strong side effects
due to his severe addiction to drugs.

595
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:05,908
That's the medical expert's opinion.

596
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:08,494
-It's what was expected.
-Yes, it is.

597
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:12,248
The only question here is whether or not
the doctor gave the appropriate drug.

598
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:14,709
But even if it was an overdose,

599
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:18,212
it was during an emergency
to calm the inmate down.

600
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:21,090
There's plenty of wiggle room here.

601
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:34,770
Mr. Gye?

602
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,605
Gosh, it's been such a long…

603
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:38,566
It's nice to meet you.

604
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:41,319
-What?
-How can I help you?

605
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:44,322
I'm Detective Kwon from Seohan PPA.

606
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:47,867
I was in the area, and I need to give
these documents to Mr. Gye.

607
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:48,951
I see.

608
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:50,036
But he's not here?

609
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:52,079
He'll be back soon.

610
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:54,915
Should I give these to him for you?

611
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,709
If you don't mind.

612
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:57,793
They're important.

613
00:38:57,877 --> 00:38:58,878
I understand.

614
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:00,254
Don't worry.

615
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:02,173
Thank you very much.

616
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:04,383
-Goodbye.
-Have a nice day.

617
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:07,636
Damn it. Why act like you know him?

618
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:23,736
LIST OF MISSING PERSONS IN THE 2000S

619
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:39,043
"Yang Jae-ha."

620
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:40,127
"Yuk Jeong-sim."

621
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:43,172
"Lim Sun"?

622
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:46,801
What are you doing?

623
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:50,596
Well, Detective Kwon just stopped by.

624
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:53,057
He asked me to give this to you.

625
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:53,974
I see.

626
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:02,650
Yes, I just got it.

627
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:05,194
I'll look it over at home and call you.

628
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:06,195
Okay, bye.

629
00:40:07,988 --> 00:40:10,908
Wait, are you leaving work right now?

630
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:11,826
Yes, I am.

631
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:13,494
I have pressing documents to go over.

632
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:14,912
I'll be going now.

633
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:30,136
I'm screwed. I'm totally screwed.

634
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:34,390
If he finds out I stole my aunt's name,
I'm doomed. What do I do?

635
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,061
"Home"?

636
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:41,021
Home!

637
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:52,116
You're leaving work early today.

638
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:54,034
You even know when I get off work?

639
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:56,495
Your office is always
the last to turn off its lights.

640
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:58,164
The prosecutor in Room 307.

641
00:40:58,247 --> 00:40:59,832
You seem very interested in me.

642
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:03,294
It's because you're quite famous, Mr. Gye.

643
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:06,714
You're more famous than I am,
Director Baek Cheol-gyu.

644
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:10,009
By any chance,

645
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:12,845
have you seen me anywhere else?

646
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:21,437
Six…

647
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:23,939
Four, three, eight.

648
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:27,276
NUMBER 35, 6438, SUV, GRAY
HWADONG MEDICAL CENTER

649
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:28,986
I don't know.

650
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:31,739
Did I see you at the hospital?

651
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:34,825
You might not remember.

652
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:37,870
It might not have been me.

653
00:41:57,515 --> 00:42:00,100
Did you quit gambling
to become a petty drug dealer?

654
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:03,020
Seriously?

655
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:05,022
I'm leaving.

656
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:06,982
You should earn your keep first.

657
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:09,443
Or pay back everything you've received.

658
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:11,362
Damn it.

659
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:18,285
Baek Cheol-gyu.

660
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:22,915
He gives me the creeps.

661
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:35,469
People are saying he's a local pillar,

662
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,680
and he's throwing money
all over the place.

663
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:39,598
That's why everyone's keeping quiet.

664
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:50,609
In the past, there were tons of rumors
that he killed his wife.

665
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:53,362
He killed his wife?

666
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:56,240
She didn't die from an illness?

667
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:58,492
His wife's body was discovered in a motel.

668
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,911
Goodness. She was having an affair.

669
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:04,039
His wife siphoned off all of their assets,

670
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:06,250
and the director was left penniless.

671
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:07,334
Wow.

672
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:11,463
Dr. Baek must've been seething with rage.

673
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:13,299
But there was no proof.

674
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:15,593
No evidence and no eyewitnesses.

675
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:18,178
I bet they couldn't find a weapon
and his alibi was solid.

676
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:21,056
So the case just fizzled out.

677
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:23,183
What about her lover?

678
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:24,977
Was he caught?

679
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,187
The woman he planned
to run away with died.

680
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:29,523
He fled overseas with all that money.

681
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:32,943
If he didn't,
he might be buried somewhere.

682
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,403
Come on!

683
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:36,530
You're making me lose my appetite.

684
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,032
I've lost all my money as it is.

685
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:41,493
It's a habit from work.

686
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:44,246
Reasonable doubt.

687
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:56,884
The motel went belly up
after the murder case.

688
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:59,094
That building was sold for a bargain.

689
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:03,182
It was auctioned off and renovated
into an apartment building.

690
00:44:03,265 --> 00:44:05,684
They probably made a huge profit from it.

691
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,896
What was the name of that building again?

692
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,440
Was it Dogi? Dog something?

693
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:14,568
That's right! It was Dogavill.

694
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:17,071
Dogavill.

695
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:21,492
DOGAVILL STUDIO APARTMENT
ROOMS FOR RENT

696
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:35,130
Mr. Gye?

697
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:37,132
-What are you doing here?
-My question exactly.

698
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:39,218
What are you doing here?

699
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:41,804
I live here.

700
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:43,681
Right, you live here…

701
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:44,598
You live here?

702
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:50,813
You can put these on.

703
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:57,820
So this is where you moved to.

704
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:03,075
For a man living alone,

705
00:45:04,284 --> 00:45:05,369
it's perfect.

706
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:07,621
Why is it so dark?

707
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:09,373
Want some coffee?

708
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:11,834
I'm on a diet.
Three creams and two sugars.

709
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:14,711
You just said you're on a diet.
Just drink what I give you.

710
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:16,588
Coffee's no good without cream and sugar.

711
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:20,801
I have to review the documents.
Drink it and go.

712
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:30,227
By the way…

713
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:37,317
I'm sorry I didn't buy you
a housewarming gift.

714
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:38,610
That's right.

715
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:41,071
Near here,
there's a great pig's trotters restaurant.

716
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:43,574
Their spicy pig's trotters
are perfect with soju.

717
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:45,409
I've decided to work overtime tonight.

718
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:47,870
My wife will understand if I tell her.

719
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:51,123
-Don't worry about anything.
-Who are you calling?

720
00:45:51,623 --> 00:45:53,125
I have documents to review.

721
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:55,210
It looks like you're done. Get up.

722
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:57,379
Take this with you.

723
00:45:58,088 --> 00:45:58,922
Go now?

724
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:00,841
It's late. We have work tomorrow.

725
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:02,384
No, I can spend the night.

726
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:03,802
-It's fine.
-Don't be absurd.

727
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:05,637
Why would you sleep here? Get up.

728
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:08,140
-Hurry up and go.
-No, I can spend the night.

729
00:46:08,223 --> 00:46:09,766
-Please go.
-I can sleep anywhere.

730
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:10,893
-I can sleep here.
-Go.

731
00:46:10,976 --> 00:46:12,644
-But--
-It's urgent for me.

732
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:15,772
-Let's review them together.
-No, I'll do it alone.

733
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:23,113
Don't come back
acting like you forgot something.

734
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:24,072
It's so immature.

735
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:25,991
What are you so obsessed about seeing?

736
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:29,536
You're so cold-hearted!

737
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:38,128
But why does he live here? How unsettling.

738
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:49,056
Is this too much?

739
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,226
LIM SUN

740
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:56,355
Yes, I just got it.

741
00:46:56,438 --> 00:46:58,565
I'll look it over at home and call you.

742
00:47:08,116 --> 00:47:10,327
Whatever. It's not that much.

743
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:15,999
Gosh, he's so cruel. So cold.

744
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:18,126
That's why he's always alone after work.

745
00:47:19,044 --> 00:47:21,922
He'll end up old and alone
with a boring life.

746
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:26,468
-Have a good night.
-Thank you. Come again.

747
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:27,386
Thank you.

748
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:36,478
The back of her head looks very familiar.

749
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:43,151
I wish he'd eat pig's trotters with me.
It's too much to eat alone.

750
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:47,489
I was going to sponge off of him
while pretending to be drunk.

751
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:49,700
It's all ruined now.

752
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:56,790
LIST OF SEOHAN CITY
MISSING PERSONS IN THE 2000S

753
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:15,559
Mom!

754
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:18,353
-Mom!
-Who let the kid in?

755
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:19,855
-Get rid of him!
-Go!

756
00:48:19,938 --> 00:48:21,398
What about my mom?

757
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:23,108
Mom!

758
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:47,799
You can do this.

759
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:49,885
It's okay.

760
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:54,473
Okay, my dears. Take a look.

761
00:48:55,682 --> 00:48:56,767
Holy cow!

762
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:58,435
Doesn't my hair look so smooth?

763
00:48:58,518 --> 00:49:00,437
Did you buy that online and get scammed?

764
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,938
No. Be quiet.

765
00:49:03,398 --> 00:49:04,274
It's this.

766
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:06,026
How do I look?

767
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:07,569
Come on!

768
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:11,073
Hello, my dears!

769
00:49:11,156 --> 00:49:12,783
I have something to show you.

770
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:14,201
Where did it go?

771
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:16,745
I can do this. Okay.

772
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:26,088
Come on.

773
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:32,219
What did you leave behind on purpose now?

774
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:33,512
Hello.

775
00:49:33,595 --> 00:49:34,554
What brings you here?

776
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:36,139
Were you with someone?

777
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:37,057
No.

778
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:39,017
What brings you here this late?

779
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:40,268
Well…

780
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:44,189
I wanted to resolve our misunderstanding
over some good food.

781
00:49:44,272 --> 00:49:45,691
-What misunderstanding?
-Well…

782
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:49,486
It's about the incidents
at the chicken restaurant and hospital.

783
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:51,655
It's okay. I already ate.

784
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:54,116
-But I'm not okay.
-What?

785
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:56,159
You invited me into your home too.

786
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:58,453
I did? When?

787
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:01,456
I was just so overwhelmed then.

788
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:03,458
I wasn't able to thank you properly

789
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:04,918
on the night your door broke.

790
00:50:05,001 --> 00:50:06,378
That wasn't an invitation.

791
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:08,672
You head-butted and kicked me.

792
00:50:08,755 --> 00:50:09,631
Okay, fine!

793
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:13,844
Let's add that on
and talk openly about everything tonight.

794
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:16,513
-Okay. Yes.
-Talk openly?

795
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:18,724
As a sign of remorse,
I'll get the heavy one.

796
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:20,934
-What are you doing? Seriously.
-Excuse me.

797
00:50:21,017 --> 00:50:22,436
You're doing this again!

798
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:23,520
To the right.

799
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:25,939
Go and eat with your friend.

800
00:50:26,022 --> 00:50:27,774
-I said I'm not hungry.
-There it is!

801
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:30,193
I have documents to review.

802
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:39,703
-Is your phone ringing?
-Right.

803
00:50:42,414 --> 00:50:43,623
Hey, Ga-yeong.

804
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:44,624
Mi-jin.

805
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:46,543
Buy me spicy pig's trotters
on your way back.

806
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:49,671
Gosh, you already ate?

807
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:52,883
Then, I have no choice
but to eat before I go to your place.

808
00:50:52,966 --> 00:50:54,676
What the hell are you saying?

809
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:57,012
I'm so hungry I could die.

810
00:50:57,095 --> 00:50:58,930
Buy me that super spicy pig's trotters.

811
00:50:59,848 --> 00:51:01,600
You're going to bed now?

812
00:51:01,683 --> 00:51:04,102
All right, you must be tired. Go to bed.

813
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:07,105
Why would I sleep? I'm so hungry
that my hands are shaking!

814
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:09,941
Buy me some spicy pig's trotters!
Is that so hard?

815
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:11,943
What? She hung up?

816
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:15,989
I slept all day.
Why does she want me to go to bed?

817
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:17,991
I'm so hungry.

818
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:21,870
Your friend's going to bed?
It's not even 8 p.m.

819
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:24,915
She usually goes to bed early.

820
00:51:24,998 --> 00:51:26,917
That's why.

821
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,585
She's an early bird.

822
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:30,670
Yeah, that's it.

823
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:33,381
Seriously, though.

824
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:37,803
But…

825
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:40,722
I brought friends.

826
00:51:41,681 --> 00:51:43,433
Ta-da!

827
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:48,522
I didn't know you worked with Ko Won.

828
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:52,067
Did he say I worked with him?

829
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:53,443
You don't?

830
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:55,654
We did.

831
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:59,241
But what kind of work do you do?

832
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:00,784
Could you call that "work"?

833
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:03,495
I wouldn't call it that.

834
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:08,208
Anyway, I signed
a non-disclosure agreement.

835
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:11,002
So I can't really tell you about it.

836
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:13,839
Okay.

837
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:16,550
Drink it quick and go home.

838
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:17,509
Go already?

839
00:52:17,592 --> 00:52:19,594
What? You want to spend the night again?

840
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:21,680
No, it's not that.

841
00:52:22,347 --> 00:52:27,519
But I thought I can't just leave
after only drinking tea.

842
00:52:27,602 --> 00:52:28,603
Then, what would we do?

843
00:52:28,687 --> 00:52:29,938
Drink alcohol.

844
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:31,648
I bought drinks.

845
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:35,402
Yeah, I'll get him drunk,
steal the documents, and run.

846
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:39,656
Why would you suddenly come here to drink?

847
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:44,160
Lately, I've had that stress…

848
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:46,371
What was it called again?

849
00:52:46,454 --> 00:52:50,458
-Because of traumatic stress…
-Post-traumatic stress disorder?

850
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:52,127
Because of that,

851
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:54,838
I'm having a hard time.

852
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:56,256
I have no one to talk to.

853
00:52:57,257 --> 00:53:00,010
Scary people keep showing up in my dreams.

854
00:53:00,093 --> 00:53:03,513
And I keep having these scary dreams,
so I'm having a hard time.

855
00:53:09,644 --> 00:53:10,687
Should I open the bottles?

856
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:16,443
Cheers!

857
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:19,487
Why am I the only one drinking?

858
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:30,790
Gosh, you're a good drinker.

859
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:34,336
Here you go.

860
00:53:34,419 --> 00:53:35,837
Splash!

861
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:38,548
This is how fast I usually drink.

862
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:39,674
Cheers!

863
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:41,384
-This doesn't feel right.
-Why?

864
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:44,930
-You're not drinking.
-Gosh. Yes, I am.

865
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:49,643
But this place is just like a prosecutor.

866
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:51,895
What does that mean?

867
00:53:52,437 --> 00:53:54,022
I mean, it's just like you.

868
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:55,649
You wouldn't get it.

869
00:53:57,651 --> 00:53:58,485
What?

870
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:00,195
Danmuji!

871
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:02,405
Wow.

872
00:54:03,531 --> 00:54:04,950
How do you know its name?

873
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:06,409
What?

874
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:08,620
What do I do?

875
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:17,128
Ga-yeong's aunt showed me a picture of it.

876
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:19,673
She was very fond of it.

877
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:21,383
I see.

878
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:25,136
Didn't you want to drink though?

879
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:28,348
Right, I want to drink so bad.

880
00:54:30,558 --> 00:54:31,601
You didn't drink at all.

881
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:33,937
What are you saying? I drank so much.

882
00:54:34,854 --> 00:54:36,106
I'm the only one who's…

883
00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:38,316
Look, this is because

884
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:42,445
I shouldn't get so drunk
and cause trouble like last time.

885
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:45,323
So after you've had your fill,

886
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:47,409
I was going to drink comfortably then.

887
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:50,996
But I don't get drunk.

888
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:55,625
-You don't?
-No.

889
00:54:56,167 --> 00:54:59,129
-I've never been drunk before.
-Are you sure you've had alcohol before?

890
00:54:59,212 --> 00:55:00,380
How is that possible?

891
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:03,174
I haven't met anyone
who could drink more than me.

892
00:55:03,883 --> 00:55:04,926
Wait.

893
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:06,678
How much can you drink?

894
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:09,055
Like four or five bottles of soju?

895
00:55:09,597 --> 00:55:10,682
Four or five?

896
00:55:10,765 --> 00:55:12,600
"Four or five?" What?

897
00:55:15,186 --> 00:55:16,938
Then, you'll meet your match today.

898
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:18,732
Someone who can outdrink you.

899
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:19,649
Let's do this.

900
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:22,318
You couldn't even
open your eyes properly last time.

901
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:24,237
Last time,

902
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:28,658
that was because I emptied
my personal liquor pot before coming here.

903
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:33,038
I can easily down
four or five bottles too.

904
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:34,914
Why are you bluffing about this?

905
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:38,543
Ha! I knew this would happen,
so I came fully prepared.

906
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:47,260
Just you wait.

907
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:56,478
I just liked you from the start.

908
00:55:57,353 --> 00:55:59,856
Wait a second.

909
00:55:59,939 --> 00:56:01,983
How could you suddenly say that?

910
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:02,984
Goodness.

911
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:06,071
I knew this day would come one day.

912
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:08,865
Have I thought about it?

913
00:56:09,824 --> 00:56:11,076
I think I did.

914
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:12,285
I swear.

915
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:13,995
Me?

916
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:16,039
Gosh.

917
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:19,250
May I ask about your parents?

918
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:20,376
They're not around.

919
00:56:21,669 --> 00:56:22,962
Here. Take this with you.

920
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:24,714
-It's fine.
-Please.

921
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:29,135
From now on,
saying "It's fine" will be prohibited.

922
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:30,428
Here. Take it.

923
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:32,180
Thank you.

924
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:37,894
When I tell people I'm an orphan,

925
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:41,648
they usually make a face or look sad.

926
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:43,942
They can't hide their expressions.

927
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:48,321
They say they're sorry or apologize to me.

928
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:50,490
That's the norm.

929
00:56:51,866 --> 00:56:55,036
But I've never met anyone
who said it didn't matter.

930
00:56:58,623 --> 00:56:59,833
When I think about it,

931
00:57:01,793 --> 00:57:02,877
it's true.

932
00:57:04,462 --> 00:57:05,463
What is?

933
00:57:07,132 --> 00:57:08,258
To be honest…

934
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:14,722
my mom was never really around.

935
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:18,309
You know what I mean?

936
00:57:20,478 --> 00:57:22,105
I'm better off alone.

937
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:28,862
Of course, it's not for the best.

938
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:29,779
But at least,

939
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:32,449
it hasn't been a bad life

940
00:57:33,074 --> 00:57:35,243
despite not having parents.

941
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:38,830
That's what came to mind.

942
00:57:41,207 --> 00:57:42,208
It was a first.

943
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:52,844
Goodness.

944
00:57:53,761 --> 00:57:54,971
What?

945
00:57:55,054 --> 00:57:56,055
What's that?

946
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:00,226
Mi-jin!

947
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:02,395
You should've told me you got these back!

948
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:04,230
Jeez.

949
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,819
Gosh, my dear son-in-law!

950
00:58:10,445 --> 00:58:12,280
Look how cleanly he washed these!

951
00:58:21,873 --> 00:58:24,125
Goodness! What's this?

952
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:25,585
Pieces of evidence?

953
00:58:26,085 --> 00:58:28,796
He definitely is a prosecutor. Goodness.

954
00:58:34,093 --> 00:58:36,221
-What's that?
-Hand lotion.

955
00:58:37,972 --> 00:58:40,934
Goodness, why did he send
something so expensive?

956
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:42,977
-Doesn't it look expensive?
-Yeah.

957
00:58:43,811 --> 00:58:45,104
Let's see.

958
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:55,865
-It smells nice.
-It does?

959
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:56,950
Yeah.

960
00:58:58,993 --> 00:58:59,827
Goodness.

961
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:44,163
Gosh, look at the time.

962
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:46,583
I'll clean this up.

963
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:48,376
No! Why? Already?

964
00:59:48,459 --> 00:59:50,086
No, I'll clean the table.

965
00:59:50,169 --> 00:59:51,087
No, it's fine.

966
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:52,338
No, wait. Already?

967
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:53,798
-Then--
-Stay seated.

968
00:59:53,881 --> 00:59:54,882
I'll clean…

969
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:59,095
-Gosh, are you okay?
-No, let me--

970
00:59:59,178 --> 01:00:00,263
Don't touch it!

971
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:02,265
Jeez, you're bleeding!

972
01:00:02,348 --> 01:00:04,142
-I'm okay.
-Get up.

973
01:00:04,809 --> 01:00:05,643
I'm so sorry.

974
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:07,937
-Watch your feet.
-No, I'm fine.

975
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:08,855
-Goodness.
-Sit here.

976
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:10,231
Gosh, the shards are everywhere.

977
01:00:10,315 --> 01:00:12,025
-I'll look for ointment. Gosh.
-Okay.

978
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:13,401
I'm so sorry.

979
01:00:13,484 --> 01:00:16,029
-Keep your hand up to stop the bleeding.
-Okay.

980
01:00:21,367 --> 01:00:23,745
Are you always this clumsy? Well?

981
01:00:24,495 --> 01:00:26,331
Why are you so careless?

982
01:00:31,127 --> 01:00:33,796
Why put your body in harm's way
instead of protecting it?

983
01:00:34,505 --> 01:00:36,633
Jeez, where's that ointment?

984
01:00:39,093 --> 01:00:41,012
You did this at the restaurant too.

985
01:00:41,095 --> 01:00:44,515
She was twice your size.
Why would you take her on?

986
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:45,683
She wasn't that big.

987
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:47,518
-Still!
-I'm sorry.

988
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:49,479
-And you're hurt now.
-I'm sorry.

989
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:56,361
What if you get into an accident that way?

990
01:01:04,452 --> 01:01:05,953
What is it?

991
01:01:06,037 --> 01:01:08,373
-Ouch!
-What is it?

992
01:01:08,456 --> 01:01:10,667
It's starting to hurt a lot!
I need ointment!

993
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:12,001
-Okay.
-Ointment! It's bleeding!

994
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:13,920
-Are you okay?
-Yes, thank you.

995
01:01:22,387 --> 01:01:26,015
"Lim Suk." Lim Suk?

996
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:27,850
LIM SUK

997
01:01:29,143 --> 01:01:30,061
Here it is.

998
01:01:37,235 --> 01:01:38,152
Jeez.

999
01:01:43,282 --> 01:01:44,534
-Let me see.
-Okay.

1000
01:01:45,576 --> 01:01:46,536
Thank you.

1001
01:01:47,912 --> 01:01:48,996
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

1002
01:01:54,585 --> 01:01:56,254
-Does it sting?
-A little.

1003
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:21,946
-Does it hurt?
-A little.

1004
01:02:22,655 --> 01:02:23,948
It's okay.

1005
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:32,248
So…

1006
01:02:32,874 --> 01:02:33,708
Well…

1007
01:02:34,709 --> 01:02:37,920
What happens if someone was
temporarily insane due to alcohol?

1008
01:02:39,213 --> 01:02:40,047
What?

1009
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:43,885
Well, sentence reduction

1010
01:02:43,968 --> 01:02:46,637
will depend on whether the incident
was an accident or not.

1011
01:02:46,721 --> 01:02:47,555
I see.

1012
01:02:50,141 --> 01:02:51,559
Why?

1013
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:56,272
Then, this isn't an accident.

1014
01:02:57,565 --> 01:02:58,733
What isn't an accident?

1015
01:03:46,447 --> 01:03:49,367
MISS NIGHT AND DAY

1016
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:51,869
But the mood was just…

1017
01:03:51,953 --> 01:03:53,037
What if…

1018
01:03:53,746 --> 01:03:55,498
Ko Won confesses that he likes you?

1019
01:03:55,581 --> 01:03:57,542
-That didn't happen!
-It's just for fun!

1020
01:03:57,625 --> 01:03:59,168
How is this fun?

1021
01:03:59,794 --> 01:04:01,295
Are you saying they drowned?

1022
01:04:01,379 --> 01:04:03,089
Fentanyl was found in their blood.

1023
01:04:03,172 --> 01:04:06,926
Are you saying the person
who killed the intern could be Dr. Baek?

1024
01:04:07,009 --> 01:04:08,553
Let's dig into Baek Cheol-gyu.

1025
01:04:08,636 --> 01:04:10,179
My stomach!

1026
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:13,599
We must find any potential evidence
before it's hidden.

1027
01:04:14,141 --> 01:04:17,645
Lim Sun, who are you?

1028
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:26,070
