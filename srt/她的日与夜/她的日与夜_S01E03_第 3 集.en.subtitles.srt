00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:52,302
He left a body part here
for everyone to see.

3
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,766
Since the ground isn't dry yet,

4
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,643
it's been less than 30 minutes.

5
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:05,231
The killer was surprised
or flustered by something.

6
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:06,608
Or they're hiding.

7
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:11,821
The culprit could still be at the scene.

8
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:19,120
Damn it.

9
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:29,631
I wonder what's in here.
He made me work so hard for this.

Ms. Lee Mi-jin!

19
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:50,707
Are you okay?

20
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,584
Yes.

21
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,171
Did you see that car's license plate?

22
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,048
No.

23
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,052
It was a silver SUV.

24
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:07,557
Did you run here? Why were you running?

25
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,933
At this late hour,

26
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,144
how can you just send a text and leave?

27
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:12,103
Jeez.

28
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,189
You're the one
who vanished without a text.

29
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:17,442
Forget it.

30
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:19,152
It's late, so let's go together.

31
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:22,405
Don't tell me.

32
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:24,282
Because it's dangerous?

33
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:26,909
I even know every tree
in this neighborhood.

34
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:30,913
I found your documents.

35
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:42,008
They flew out
when the car suddenly stopped.

36
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:44,677
Still, your papers are okay.

37
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:46,929
They're a bit crumpled though.

38
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,357
Judging by the skid marks,

39
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:01,069
the driver was going over at least 60 kmh.

40
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,863
There's a high chance it was the culprit.

41
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,701
Was that car from this neighborhood?

42
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,870
Every other family has a silver SUV here.

43
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:14,165
Was anything suspicious?

44
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,044
I don't know. It happened so fast.

45
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:19,837
Still, try to think.

46
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:21,798
Even something small will help.

47
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:31,099
There was a strange smell.

48
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:32,975
What smell?

49
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,685
A smell I've never smelled before.

50
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:37,313
The smell of blood or a corpse.

51
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:39,690
By any chance, was it fishy or bad?

52
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:41,526
It wasn't like that.

53
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:45,655
It was more unique than unpleasant.

54
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:48,574
Was it an air freshener?

55
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,124
Where is she?

56
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,129
She's coming!

57
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,768
Go on in. If anything happens,
make sure to call me.

58
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:16,686
Okay.

59
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,373
Jeez, you scared me.

60
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,791
-Hey!
-Hey!

61
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,209
What are you doing this late?

62
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,837
What about you? Why were you out so late?

63
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:45,047
Fine, I'll be home earlier next time.

64
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,382
That's not what I meant.

65
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:49,343
I'm not complaining about you being late.

66
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:50,970
What matters is who you were with.

67
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:53,848
I'm going inside.

68
00:07:57,185 --> 00:08:00,354
Mi-jin, who were you with
and what were you doing?

69
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:03,024
Why are you being like this too, Dad?
Come on.

70
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:04,442
-I'm going in.
-Okay.

71
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:15,953
My back!

72
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,288
Good grief.

73
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:18,956
What a long day.

74
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,291
I'm so tired.

00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,585

76
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:25,046
-Were those documents important?
-Yes.

77
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:26,881
Daeho-ri?

78
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,303

What a relief!

92
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:32,775

would've been a waste.

It's so new and clean!

97

Hello, Detective Kwon.

00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,967
It seems I missed your call.

100
00:11:58,551 --> 00:11:59,927
Why did you call so early?

101
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:03,347
There was something missing
from the file you sent me.

102
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,434
That case? Kang Gyeong-hui's file?

103
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:07,852
It was gone. It's missing.

00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:09,895

-Are they still there?
-No, he retired.

was in charge of that case?

00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,415
I understand.

112
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:40,968
An unheard of sulfuric acid attack

-Really?
-My gosh.

You're amazing.

00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,090
You were so brave.

131
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,635
I only did what I had to.

132
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:24,053
Thank you so much.

133
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:27,264
She saved someone's life.
Doesn't she deserve another prize?

134
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,141
Of course, we have plans for that.

135
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,894
Yes, we're considering what it should be.

136
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:37,107
Since we're here for this happy occasion,
I have some more good news to share.

137
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,902
We have a new intern
who will take over for Ko Na-heun.

138
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,363
Mr. Baek Cheol-gyu,
come out and say hello.

139
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:50,788
It's nice to meet you.

140
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:53,290
My name is Baek Cheol-gyu.

141
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:56,126
But Ko Na-heun left just recently.

142
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,253
You already hired someone?

143
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,755
Already? He's been absent
without notice for a week.

144
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:01,298
He's caused so much trouble.

145
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:02,716
What's he saying?

146
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,469
Mr. Baek is the director
of Hwadong Medical Center.

147
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:06,762
-What?
-Goodness!

148
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:08,764
Sir, I had no idea.

149
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,768
I'm flattered, but that was ages ago.

150
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,520
You don't have to say "sir."

151
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,481
-Director?
-A round of applause, please.

152
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,035
What's with you now? What is it?

153
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:33,163
What's the problem?

154
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:35,249
How interesting.

155
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:39,336
Why would a hospital director
want to come here to work?

156
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,796
What's wrong with our work?

157
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:43,883
I made billions in profit back in my day.

158
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:46,093
And I had dozens of employees.

159
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:48,262
Still, I see what he means.

160
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:52,141
People with nothing
had to fight to get this job.

161
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,643
But he has everything,
so it's strange he'd come here.

162
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:59,356
What? I don't mind.

163
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,484
We're a bunch of nobodies
as public works interns,

164
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:03,986
but he's increased our prestige.

165
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,030
To put it bluntly,

166
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:07,823
did he increase our prestige?

167
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:08,949
It was Ms. Lim

168
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:11,243
who increased it by saving a life.

169
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:13,704
Take a look at this.

00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:17,124
"Protecting lives
from a sulfuric acid attack."

171
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:18,584
It was nothing.

172
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:21,170
Yeah, it was nothing.

173
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:24,006
I used to move around quick
at her age too.

174
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:27,843
True. If I was just ten years younger,
then I'd also…

175
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:31,138
I see you in a new light now, Ms. Lim.

176
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:34,391
With those kind of guts,
you could've been a cop.

177
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:37,269
Why have you let
such skills go to waste until now?

178
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:42,149
I heard the guy you saved

179
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:45,778
happened to be a huge star
even among celebrities.

180
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:48,989
Do you think
we might benefit from this too?

181
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,533
Gosh, I didn't do it
expecting anything in return.

182
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:54,912
Why not? Maybe a little something, right?

183
00:15:54,995 --> 00:16:00,501
DOGAVILL STUDIO APARTMENT
ROOMS FOR RENT

184
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:05,798
Just leave it by the door, please!

185
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:08,050
Excuse me!

186
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:13,222
You can just leave it by the door and go!

187
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,769
Jeez!

188
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:23,107
Just leave it by the door.

189
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,567
I'm sorry, but can you open the door?

190
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:26,944
There's a lot of stuff.

191
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:29,446
I'm Ko Won's manager.

192
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,781
What is he talking about?

193
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:34,994
-Hello.
-Hi.

194
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,378
What is all of this?

195
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:45,796
There's still more.

196
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:49,800
What?

197
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,052
These are gifts from Ko Won to thank you.

198
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:55,681
The car's outside.

199
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,434
What are you talking about?

200
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:02,688
Seriously?

201
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,773
This is ridiculous.

202
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,201
Wait.

203
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:17,786
Is that…

204
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:18,996
Is the Ko Won you mean

205
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:20,998
that Ko Won?

206
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:24,376
-Yes, that's right.
-But why would he give me this?

207
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,045
Not you, but your mother.

208
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,129
What?

209
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:30,382
-I don't have a mom.
-What?

210
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:34,053
Isn't this where Lim Sun lives?

211
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:36,472
Lim Sun?

212
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,416
PROSECUTOR GYE JI-UNG

213
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:35,697
I didn't get a chance to thank him.

214
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,324
So it was new.

215
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:03,660
What's up?

216
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,584
Hey, I can explain everything.

217
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:12,586
The thing is…

218
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:14,880
What happened was…

219
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:17,507
Just wait, okay?

220
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:20,510
Damn it!

221
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:27,351
I don't know this lady!

222
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:29,102
Get out. Who are you, lady?

223
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,687
-I'm their daughter.
-No, she's not!

224
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:31,939
She's not our daughter!

225
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:33,523
This is insane!

226
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:34,691
I'm your daughter!

227
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,212
-Is that you, Mi-jin?
-Yeah, it's me.

228
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:57,130
Open the door. There's so much.

229
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,717
-What is this?
-I'll tell you the whole story.

230
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:02,135
What?

231
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,804
Why did you bring this in?

232
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:05,639
Just put it back outside.

233
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:07,557
I told you on the phone earlier.

234
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:08,600
I've changed a lot.

235
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,519
My gosh! What in the world?

236
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:11,853
Get out!

237
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,230
I'm Mi-jin!

238
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:14,815
Hey! Damn.

239
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:17,818
Hey, you of all people have to believe me.

240
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:21,488
I know all the guys
who've dumped you so far.

241
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:24,241
Baek Seo-woo, Choi Jin-yeong,
Lee Yeong-min, Nam Jeong-woo.

242
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:26,076
Yu Jun-gyeong!

243
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,122
How did you know that?

244
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:32,332
-Because--
-Also, lady…

245
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,544
I dumped Baek Seo-woo and Lee Yeong-min.

246
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,171
Either way, I know your passcode too.

247
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:49,474
I'm Lee Mi-jin.

248
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:52,019
I think I've been possessed.

249
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:56,481
This is my bag.

250
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,692
-That's Mi-jin's bag.
-Yeah, it's my bag.

251
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:00,068
How is it your bag, lady?

252
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,029
These are my mom's clothes. Remember?

253
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:03,196
Those are her mom's.

254
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,781
Yeah, my mom's clothes.

255
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:07,826
-Your mom?
-My birthday's March 16, 1996.

256
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:09,369
Your birthday's October 3rd.

257
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:10,495
Your dad's Do Pyeon-gang!

258
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,873
You know I'm right!

259
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:14,082
-You're right.
-Right?

260
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,334
How did you know that?

261
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:16,877
Because I'm Mi-jin!

262
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,129
-So you're…
-I'm Mi-jin.

263
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:20,422
-My friend, Mi-jin?
-Yes.

264
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:21,673
Then, where is she now?

265
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,342
Seriously!

266
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:26,803
Were you even listening this whole time?

267
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:30,724
I become like this when the sun rises,
and I turn back to normal at sundown.

268
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,769
This is driving me crazy.

269
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:36,271
What are you talking about?
This lady's crazy.

270
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:39,024
Where did you go, Mi-jin?

271
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:41,109
See?

272
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:44,237
GA-YEONG

273
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:47,449
Damn it.

274
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:48,492
You believe me now?

275
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:51,369
So is this like what they call

276
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:53,997
organ trafficking or something?

277
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:57,542
-What?
-Is this voice phishing?

278
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,628
Where's Mi-jin?

279
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,630
-I said I'm Mi-jin!
-Poor Mi-jin!

280
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:02,631
Who are you calling?

281
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,549
-Your phone…
-Wait. Don't touch me!

282
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:07,344
Jeez, lady! Don't touch me!

283
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:08,929
Lady, are you for real?

284
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:11,306
Hey! Why are you so strong?

285
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:14,392
-What is this?
-This is insane!

286
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:17,813
I don't know why I keep changing either!

287
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:20,982
Since when were your arms this strong?

288
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,276
Is this a hidden camera prank?

289
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,904
-Mi-jin!
-Yeah?

290
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:27,155
Come out, Mi-jin.

291
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,740
-I'm right here.
-Lee Mi-jin…

292
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:31,827
I said I'm Mi-jin.

293
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,912
How are you Mi-jin, lady?

294
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:38,583
You want me to hit you
and mess up your fillers?

295
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,252
Jeez, that hurts.

296
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:42,379
No one knows about this.

297
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:45,465
Of course not! Just the two of us went.
It was a two-for-one deal.

298
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:47,759
I got laser treatment. You got fillers.

299
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:50,178
I didn't want to go,
but you said it was cheap.

300
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,180
You coaxed me into it for the ad deal!

301
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:54,224
Take a look. Down here.

302
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:57,060
I still have the burn mark. Do you see it?

303
00:23:57,894 --> 00:23:58,937
Right?

304
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,273
I have the emotional scars
because of you too.

305
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:08,864
Damn it! Don't!

306
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:10,782
Stop it!

307
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:12,450
Don't!

308
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,786
I said stop it!

309
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,371
You're Mi-jin, but…

310
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:17,539
How could you be her?

311
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:20,542
-Take a look.
-This makes no sense!

312
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:24,045
What is this? This is ridiculous!
What are you talking about?

313
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,256
All this talking
is just wasting by breath.

314
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,552
Hey, the sun's setting.

315
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,888
-Come take a look.
-Don't touch me, lady!

316
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:34,472
-Okay!
-What will you do to me?

317
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:35,849
Okay! Just wait!

318
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:37,517
When the sun sets,

319
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,686
I'm going to change. Just wait.

320
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:42,063
Take a look! Watch!

321
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:45,525
-It's setting.
-Do I have to wait for this?

322
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:46,526
You can record it.

323
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:48,820
-Save it to your phone.
-Okay.

324
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,322
I need evidence anyway.

325
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:52,782
Don't be surprised.

326
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:54,826
Whatever.

327
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:56,620
Change, my foot.

328
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:14,763
Holy crap!

329
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,264
-Gosh!
-Are you okay?

330
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:19,476
I knew it'd scare her. I knew it.

331
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,230
Holy cow!

332
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:30,153
Is that you, Mi-jin?

333
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:31,279
Yeah, it's me!

334
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:34,241
I said it's me! Can't you tell it's me?

335
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:35,867
Don't I look different now?

336
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:37,953
I'm telling you it's me.

337
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:48,922
So that stray cat did this to you?

338
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:50,632
I think so.

339
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:52,759
And you took
your aunt's name for the alter ego…

340
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:54,052
Lim Sun.

341
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,888
ACID ATTACKER CAUGHT BY 50-YEAR-OLD

342
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:01,184
And the lady who did this to Ko Won…

343
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:03,478
It was Lim Sun. It was me.

344
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:05,605
How many times do I have to tell you?

345
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:08,566
I said I think I ended up like this
because of that cat,

346
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:11,361
and all of that was me, Lim Sun.

347
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:13,780
No. If you were me, would you say,

348
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:15,865
"I see. My friend Mi-jin

349
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:17,993
just aged overnight like this."

350
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:20,412
"But only during the day."
You'd believe that?

351
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:22,122
Fine! Don't believe it then!

352
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:24,374
-I don't!
-Fine!

353
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,005
Seriously.

354
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:36,011
So did you upload the video
about the missing cat or not?

355
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:40,890
So that's why you asked me
to put that ad on my channel.

356
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:42,058
Exactly!

357
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:44,644
I get it now!

358
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:48,565
It's why you only came at night
and why you used my address as yours.

359
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:50,734
Hey.

360
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:53,320
What if your parents find out?

361
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:55,280
They absolutely can't find out.

362
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:57,782
If they find out I was scammed,

363
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,159
I'll die.

364
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:00,994
Your mom would execute you.

365
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:06,791
So just help me out
until I get better, okay?

366
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:09,419
Okay. So we have to find that cat.

367
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:10,628
-Is that it?
-Yeah.

368
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:12,047
Okay, then.

369
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,215
I'll visit animal shelters tomorrow.

370
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:17,385
Thank you so much. I knew you'd help me.

371
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:18,636
Thank you so much.

372
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,681
Hey. Before I help you, handle that first.

373
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:24,559
I mean, seriously…

374
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,146
I know he's showering me with money…

375
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:31,816
But isn't this too much?
I don't know about this.

376
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,026
Hey.

377
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:35,904
He earns billions a year
in royalties alone.

378
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:37,197
He can do anything he wants.

379
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,990
-Billions?
-Yeah.

380
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:42,077
Wow, I'm so jealous.

381
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:53,880
KO WON

382
00:27:57,967 --> 00:28:00,136
This is Seohan District
Prosecutors' Office.

383
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:11,106
This is more like a fan club meeting.

384
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:14,234
-He's not even that impressive.
-What?

385
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:16,903
King Land's annual profit last year
was 100 billion won.

386
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:19,739
Of course, Ko Won
earned the most among them!

387
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:23,326
His show had the highest ratings
even with his bad acting.

388
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:24,452
LIKES

389
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:27,038
All of his songs would top
the music charts.

390
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:31,292
The channel he created out of boredom
had a million subscribers on launch.

391
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:35,630
Before the incident, he had either shot
or signed up for 15 commercials!

392
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:38,425
BEST OF THE BEST
K-POP'S COMMERCIAL STAR, KO WON

393
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:39,509
A WIDE RANGE OF ADS

394
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:41,428
Of course, he wasted it all.

395
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:45,056
"Is it a crime to have someone else
get me sleeping pills?"

396
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:48,059
To put it bluntly,
he enlisted since he was guilty.

397
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:52,063
He fell during their comeback concert
and had a herniated disc.

398
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:55,608
Because of his back injury,
he was assigned to public service instead.

399
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:56,526
I need water.

400
00:28:57,944 --> 00:28:59,404
This is what's next.

401
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:02,574
Yes, I understand.

402
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:08,955
And because of that,
you have it easy here. I'm so jealous.

403
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:10,582
Nothing ever works out for me.

404
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:12,959
But everything works out for you.

405
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,254
He's so cute!

406
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:31,352
Ma'am.

407
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:33,938
I need to talk to you outside.

408
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:37,859
Hey, I'm going out for a bit.

409
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:38,943
What did you just…

410
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:43,656
Make sure to keep your breaks
as short as you can.

411
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,241
-Be back quickly.
-Okay.

412
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:06,554
-Hot?
-What?

413
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:09,516
-Iced.
-You knew what I meant?

414
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:11,726
Older folks usually like
hot coffee though.

415
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:13,937
I always get iced coffee.

416
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:15,897
Me too.

417
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:19,734
Why did you want to talk?

418
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:21,569
You can tell me anything.

419
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,822
I'll listen to whatever you have to say.

420
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:28,701
I want to return
what you sent me yesterday.

421
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:32,831
I put everything in the car.

422
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:35,834
Why?

423
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:37,126
You didn't like the gifts?

424
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,462
They were too much
to just be called gifts.

425
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:42,090
Just take this then.

426
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:45,343
This was the most excessive one!
Who gives a car as thanks?

427
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:49,097
I'll just take this drink.

428
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,307
I heard you ride your bike around.

429
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:52,559
What's wrong with that?

430
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:54,727
I ride it on purpose for my health.

431
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:58,982
You could fall and break a bone
while riding around.

432
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:02,485
Look, thank you for being considerate,

433
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:04,445
but I'll take care of my own health.

434
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:07,156
-How about a scooter then?
-I said it's fine!

435
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:09,117
I was thinking of you--

436
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,203
If you need to do something for me
to make you feel better,

437
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:15,707
then just buy me coffee from time to time.

438
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,542
That would be more than enough.

439
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:19,711
Then, I'll get you a coffee shop--

440
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:20,962
For crying out loud!

441
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:24,132
What about a coffee machine?

442
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:25,383
-I'm leaving.
-Wait!

443
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:27,302
Wait! Where are you going? Why?

444
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:29,679
Where are you going? All right.

445
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:33,224
No, wait. Okay, I got it.

446
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:35,310
Just take a seat for a moment.

447
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:42,108
Then, I'll get you an iced coffee
every morning. Deal?

448
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:43,484
Maybe not every morning--

449
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,278
-I'm going.
-Okay!

450
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:46,821
Daily coffee. Deal.

451
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:50,033
Daily coffee. Deal?

452
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:51,743
Okay, deal.

453
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:55,538
Daily coffee.

454
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:05,840
Thanks to the huge crime you committed,
you'll be more famous than Ko Won.

455
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,731
Ko Won's arrival
was announced that morning,

456
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:24,692
but how did you know
and prepare in advance, Mr. Ji Dong-kwon?

457
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:27,904
Did someone give you a tip
about his schedule?

458
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:30,323
How dare he go around
with his head held high?

459
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:32,116
Who does he think he is?

460
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,869
You're not cooperating at all.

461
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:36,996
Let's try again.

462
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:40,959
Did Ko Won ever harass you,
Mr. Ji Dong-kwon?

463
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:46,130
I know everything.

464
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:48,091
I know what he's thinking.

465
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:50,093
What is he thinking?

466
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:56,182
He shamelessly smiles,
but he's terrified on the inside.

467
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:04,190
At his autograph signing event,
I saw him curse at me.

468
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:10,321
You mean last year
when you were indicted for hate comments?

469
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:13,658
That's when that bastard cursed at me!

470
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:16,661
Judging from the video,
you were at least 20 meters away from him.

471
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:19,998
Your eyesight must be sharper
than an eagle's.

472
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:22,250
You're all on the same team.

473
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:24,877
This is why I go mad.

474
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,463
Because of all of you,

475
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:29,298
I can't help but take drugs.

476
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:32,593
Bring them to me.

477
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:35,680
My drugs!

478
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:36,931
Bring me my drugs!

479
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:40,601
Well, doing that
will only hurt your hands.

480
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,146
Let's make it a tidy confession.

481
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:45,940
You held a grudge against Ko Won,

482
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:49,152
who sued you for hate comments,
and with all those reporters there,

483
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:50,820
you planned to get revenge, right?

484
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:53,656
Just a moment.

485
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:56,117
I love you all!

486
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,244
Take a look at this.

487
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:01,914
It's that bitch's fault.

488
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:04,876
It's all because of her.

489
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:09,047
That damn old lady ruined everything!

490
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:14,761
Hey, you punk! Ji Dong-kwon! Settle down!

491
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:20,892
I'll kill that bitch!

492
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:24,937
I'm going to kill her! Let go!

493
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:31,402
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

494
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:34,864
They say the drugs he was on
are new ones popular at clubs.

495
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:36,616
It's a modified drug patch.

496
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:39,410
I bet they'll even make
topical drugs soon.

497
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,954
I guess you and Ko Won
were destined to be linked.

498
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:43,372
You're entwined again.

499
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:46,042
You met in court and reunited
at the prosecutors' office

500
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:47,085
with him as the victim.

501
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,127
Destiny, my foot.

502
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:50,338
Don't use that word so carelessly.

503
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:53,591
Didn't you say
Ji Dong-kwon lives in Seohan City?

504
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:56,552
Yes, the report says Seoul,
but he lives in Seohan City.

505
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:58,346
We found sulfuric acid at his house.

506
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:00,431
He moves to Seohan City,

507
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:03,518
and the person who sued him
just happens to be assigned to Seohan?

508
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:06,896
That kind of destiny rivals your own.

509
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:19,492
You didn't drive?

510
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:21,536
I was tired,
so I took some sleeping pills.

511
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:23,788
-Just being safe.
-You should've summoned him then.

512
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,499
Why come all the way
to the detention center?

513
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,417
To ease nerves.

514
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:30,795
Whose?

515
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:34,173
Whose nerves?

516
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:35,508
Get in the car.

517
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:36,926
Who?

518
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,502
-Did you bring the document?
-Yes.

519
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:08,517
"Hang in there. You got this."

520
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:10,019
If you say that--

521
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:11,812
How could I even comfort you?

522
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,522
My life's hard too.

523
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:18,069
I'm in no position to comfort anyone.

524
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:24,325
They're vitamins.

525
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:29,372
You know too many vitamins
can make you sick too, right?

526
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:32,541
Don't overdo it.

527
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,296
You know too many vitamins
can make you sick too, right?

528
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:21,882
Don't overdo it.

529
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:56,417
-You must've had some work to do outside.
-Yes.

530
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:02,923
You weren't in your office this morning.

531
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:05,509
No, I wasn't.

532
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:11,182
Do you have something to say?

533
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:13,893
I just wanted to thank you.

534
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:15,895
For what?

535
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,292
Here.

536
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:41,712
It's my favorite flavor.

537
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:44,173
I see. Thank you.

538
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:05,486
That's so funny!

539
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:06,821
You're too kind.

540
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:08,280
I'm not smart, so I know nothing.

541
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:09,532
Goodness!

542
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:13,411
You didn't head home?

543
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:15,162
It's still office hours.

544
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:20,668
Could you send this data
as files to the investigator?

545
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:22,711
I'll do it tomorrow.

546
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:25,047
Send it today for the report, okay?

547
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:26,632
The work day's almost over.

548
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:33,639
It needs to be handed over
to prosecute or do anything.

549
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:35,516
But it's just so much work.

550
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:39,061
You work four to five hours a day at best.

551
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:40,312
But that's too much?

552
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:43,732
Then, you want me to sit at my desk
for eight hours without breaks?

553
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:49,488
If you're not going to work
eight hours a day, why are you even here?

554
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,699
Because I get paid.

555
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:54,952
Right, so you work as much
as you're paid and do it properly.

556
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:56,620
-Isn't that normal?
-Exactly.

557
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:58,998
I won't get paid more for working hard.

558
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:01,750
There's no need
to work until exhaustion. Right?

559
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:06,172
I see. So that's the type
of person you are.

560
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:07,840
What's that mean?

561
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:09,300
Ignorant.

562
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:10,926
-Irresponsible.
-Excuse me?

563
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:13,179
-Lacks common sense.
-What did you say?

564
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:14,096
I'll correct that.

565
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,389
Totally thoughtless.

566
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:22,313
I won't do it!

567
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:24,899
I'm going to kill him!

568
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:27,234
That bastard!

569
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:29,195
Excuse me? I'm sorry but--

570
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:31,906
I'm so annoyed right now!
Don't talk to me!

571
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:40,206
Excuse me? Are you okay?

572
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:42,291
I said don't talk to me!

573
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:44,043
I told you to stop talking to me!

574
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:50,132
Hey, lady!

575
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:51,967
There's no tissue paper. Damn it.

576
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:53,928
That's why I was going to put it in.

577
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,179
Are you mocking me?

578
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:57,431
This is ridiculous.

579
00:41:58,182 --> 00:41:59,391
Tissues.

580
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:01,227
Do your job properly!

581
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:04,563
Wow, that crazy…

582
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:08,317
You're lucky
you didn't run into me at night!

583
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:13,864
Crazy bastard.

584
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:15,699
He thinks he's so important.

585
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:21,205
He's like a damn virus.

586
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:22,456
So annoying!

587
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:24,124
You're crying…

588
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,584
I've been too upset.

589
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:26,669
"What about my makeup?"

590
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:27,836
When you have a meltdown…

591
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,839
Does he think I can't get another job?

592
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:33,092
Whatever! I'm a Do Ga-yeong fan!

593
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:36,637
Nice and thinly. First, take the base…

594
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:39,348
-This is good.
-Good?

595
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:43,227
To lose someone
when we're understaffed as it is?

596
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:46,230
Process her resignation
and send another office assistant.

597
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:48,983
Look here, Gye.

598
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:52,486
Is it that hard to stay under the radar?

599
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:53,988
Is it?

600
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:57,074
Is it due to hard feelings with Ko Won
and having his acid case now?

601
00:42:58,033 --> 00:43:00,619
Why would there be
any hard feelings when it's work?

602
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:01,954
Even if there were, why--

603
00:43:02,037 --> 00:43:04,623
Are you trying to get even
because you were angered?

604
00:43:05,207 --> 00:43:06,542
Is that what you do, sir?

605
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:11,088
Do you involve personal feelings into work
to get revenge, get even, or retaliate?

606
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:12,256
You little punk.

607
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:13,799
You just insulted me.

608
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,304
How could I possibly do that?

609
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:19,763
So just talk to her--

610
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:21,348
You can teach what they don't know.

611
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:22,975
And time solves inexperience.

612
00:43:23,058 --> 00:43:24,810
But being ignorant can't be fixed.

613
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:28,314
Anyway, this was my fault. I apologize.

614
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:32,943
I assume you took my request so I'll go.

615
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,653
Wait. I'm not done yet!

616
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:37,281
You kept repeating yourself,
so I thought you were.

617
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:40,993
I'm really going now.

618
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:47,458
Damn it!

619
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:49,293
Kang's always been so selfish.

620
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:51,587
I knew it when he gushed
with praise for Gye.

621
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:55,674
We're low on staff. Who do I assign?

622
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:08,729
She saved someone's life.

623
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:11,565
-Doesn't she deserve another prize?
-Of course, we have plans for that.

624
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:14,568
Yes, we're considering what it should be.

625
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:24,662
Damn, it's cold!

626
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:26,580
Hey, there's no dismembered corpse!

627
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,540
Pull out!

628
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:30,250
Let's pull out!

629
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:31,669
Pull out! Pack it up!

630
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:32,836
Get the equipment!

631
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:33,921
Pull out!

632
00:44:34,546 --> 00:44:35,964
Let's go home.

633
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:44,139
Did you find anything else?

634
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:47,601
Not yet. Not sure
if that's a good thing or not.

635
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:48,769
What?

636
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:49,687
The victim

637
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:51,438
could still be alive.

638
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:53,482
Wait.

639
00:44:54,983 --> 00:44:56,318
If she's still alive…

640
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:58,987
The limb hasn't shown
discoloration or rigor mortis,

641
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:01,281
so it was cut while she was still alive.

642
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:04,660
Man, this guy's an absolute lunatic.

643
00:45:04,743 --> 00:45:05,953
It was a living person.

644
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:11,250
But…

645
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,627
why would he have been so cruel?

646
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:17,423
Good question.

647
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:20,426
I think there was a similar case before.

648
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:23,470
In the files that I gave you,

649
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:26,598
wasn't there a victim
who was dismembered while still alive?

650
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:38,110
Is the autopsy report out yet?

651
00:45:38,193 --> 00:45:39,820
It'll be out next week.

652
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:43,490
Also, about the silver SUV
you mentioned from that night…

653
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:44,658
Yes, did you find it?

654
00:45:44,741 --> 00:45:47,369
We checked all traffic cameras
on roads leading out of town,

655
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:49,955
but from the night
of the accident to morning,

656
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:53,459
there weren't any silver SUVs
that left during that time.

657
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:57,754
This path is the only one here,
which means they went into town.

658
00:45:58,714 --> 00:45:59,840
By any chance,

659
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:03,260
can you see if any of these cars
look familiar to you?

660
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:05,804
I sent this by text to you too.

661
00:46:06,388 --> 00:46:09,224
Even if it's silver,
there are many different shades.

662
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:11,685
Light and dark gray.
They're all different.

663
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:14,688
I'd be grateful
if you could pick the most similar.

664
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:16,523
-I'll check.
-Okay.

665
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:17,566
Take care.

666
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:18,901
Detective Kwon!

667
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:20,027
-Come here!
-Coming!

668
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:38,879
DOCUMENTS

669
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:42,508
The person you are trying to call…

670
00:46:43,091 --> 00:46:44,843
Why won't she unblock me?

671
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:07,384
Six…

672
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,636
Four, three, eight.

673
00:48:17,894 --> 00:48:18,979
Damn it!

674
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:34,036
Six, four, three, eight.

675
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:51,011
Mr. Gye.

676
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:57,309
At this point, it seems
you're blocking me on purpose.

677
00:48:57,392 --> 00:48:58,518
Right, I forgot.

678
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:02,189
I'm sorry.

679
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:05,067
I've been so busy lately
that I forgot to unblock you.

680
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:07,235
You called me.

681
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:08,862
What brings you here?

682
00:49:08,945 --> 00:49:10,614
Let's go somewhere and talk.

683
00:49:12,824 --> 00:49:13,867
My goodness.

684
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:16,161
Let's go out.

685
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:18,455
-Let's take the car.
-Okay.

686
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:20,832
Goodness!

687
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:22,709
It's late. Where are you going?

688
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:24,336
Come in and talk. Come in.

689
00:49:24,419 --> 00:49:26,338
-No, it's fine.
-Nonsense.

690
00:49:26,421 --> 00:49:28,090
It's not fine with me.

691
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:29,508
Come inside.

692
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:32,010
-We're not strangers, are we?
-We are!

693
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:33,470
Be quiet. Come on.

694
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:36,181
Make yourself at home. Relax.

695
00:49:36,264 --> 00:49:38,141
-But I can't relax…
-I'll help you.

696
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:39,309
I don't think you can.

697
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:42,229
-Ms. Lee?
-Dad, do something about Mom.

698
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:44,356
-Me?
-No.

699
00:49:46,274 --> 00:49:47,275
Damn it.

700
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:02,249
Take a seat. Sit down.

701
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:06,128
What are you doing?

702
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:07,713
Honey?

703
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:12,509
Hurry and sit. Sit down.

704
00:50:14,594 --> 00:50:15,804
Okay.

705
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:18,724
-Open up.
-I can eat it.

706
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:20,225
Come on now. Open up.

707
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:25,605
Should we talk outside?

708
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:27,315
-Yes.
-Okay.

709
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:29,192
Why go outside? Go in and talk.

710
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:31,737
-In where?
-Where do you think? Your room.

711
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:33,196
-My room?
-Yeah.

712
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,156
Why would we?

713
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:35,824
Here.

714
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:37,826
-What's with you?
-Come on.

715
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:39,369
It's important. Right?

716
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:40,746
Go inside and quietly talk.

717
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:42,122
It's okay. Go inside.

718
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:43,165
It's only one question.

719
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:45,167
-Honey, the fork.
-Right.

720
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:47,252
It won't take long though.

721
00:50:47,335 --> 00:50:49,755
Go inside. It's quiet.
Make yourself comfortable.

722
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:51,923
Just relax.

723
00:50:52,007 --> 00:50:53,008
But I can't…

724
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:55,594
Pretend we're not here.

725
00:50:56,261 --> 00:50:57,137
Mom, please…

726
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:00,974
Jeez.

727
00:51:20,118 --> 00:51:20,952
This is…

728
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:23,371
This is really good for dieting.

729
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:25,248
I can do arm workouts.

730
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:27,918
I can work biceps and triceps
and do squats with it.

731
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:31,004
Well, people who often fail go on diets.

732
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:35,634
So what did you want to ask me?

733
00:51:36,384 --> 00:51:38,637
I can't hear a word they're saying.

734
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:44,226
I know.

735
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:45,769
The room's soundproofed well.

736
00:51:55,904 --> 00:51:57,656
He didn't come just to talk, right?

737
00:51:57,739 --> 00:51:59,533
-Then, what else?
-Come on.

738
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:03,328
A young man and woman
wouldn't talk with just their words.

739
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,337
By any chance, are any of these
the silver SUV from that day?

740
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:20,095
It was a light gray SUV.

741
00:52:20,178 --> 00:52:23,640
But it was dark and at night,
so I'm not sure.

742
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:36,403
Light gray.

743
00:52:37,696 --> 00:52:40,282
That would narrow it down to 20 cars.

744
00:52:47,914 --> 00:52:49,499
You have to check each one?

745
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:50,959
They'll analyze the tracks.

746
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:53,169
Identifying the tire model will help.

747
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:59,467
What was that smell though?

748
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:00,802
It was so unique.

749
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:03,471
If I could just remember that,

750
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:05,640
I think it would help.

751
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:19,446
Take care.

752
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:24,367
Drive safely.

753
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:36,171
Goodness!

754
00:53:40,508 --> 00:53:41,635
A prosecutor?

755
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:46,348
Of all public servants,
did you snag the best? A prime cut?

756
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:48,808
If he's a prime cut,
what am I? Frozen pork?

757
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:50,477
Hardly. You're chopped liver.

758
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:52,896
Thanks for hitting me
with that hard truth.

759
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:53,939
It sure hurts.

760
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:54,856
Jeez.

761
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:55,941
Pork belly's fine.

762
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:57,776
Chopped liver, too.

763
00:53:57,859 --> 00:53:59,653
You snagged the cream

764
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:01,071
of the crop.

765
00:54:03,114 --> 00:54:05,450
At the tail end of your twenties,

766
00:54:05,533 --> 00:54:07,786
you've hit the jackpot.

767
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:08,954
A prosecutor?

768
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:12,123
A prosecutor!

769
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:13,291
Come on in. Prosecutor.

770
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:14,250
Okay? Prosecutor.

771
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:16,378
-A prosecutor's here!
-Dad.

772
00:54:16,461 --> 00:54:19,130
I don't know why
she's like that either, so don't ask.

773
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:21,424
A prosecutor came to our house! How nice!

774
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:23,134
This is so embarrassing.

775
00:54:23,885 --> 00:54:24,970
I'm so embarrassed.

776
00:54:25,053 --> 00:54:27,931
All right, a prosecutor!

777
00:54:36,022 --> 00:54:37,065
Bye, Mom.

778
00:54:38,274 --> 00:54:40,151
Mi-jin. Wait, come here.

779
00:54:40,235 --> 00:54:41,069
What is it?

780
00:54:41,152 --> 00:54:42,779
Here. Drink this before you go.

781
00:54:42,862 --> 00:54:44,447
-Mom, I have no time.
-Drink it!

782
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:49,703
By the way,
how did you meet that prosecutor?

783
00:54:51,162 --> 00:54:54,082
Drink it! It's good for you.
Don't spit it out. Hurry.

784
00:54:57,335 --> 00:54:58,503
-Good girl.
-I'm late.

785
00:54:58,586 --> 00:55:00,380
-I'll be back.
-Wait.

786
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:01,715
Tell me how you met him.

787
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:04,718
There's no reason for it
unless you got in trouble!

788
00:55:05,343 --> 00:55:06,678
That brat!

789
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:12,684
That was close.

790
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:16,646
Let me introduce myself.

791
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:18,314
I'm Seo Mal-tae.

792
00:55:19,107 --> 00:55:20,191
He's a former detective.

793
00:55:20,775 --> 00:55:22,736
When Detective Seo was on the scene,

794
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:25,321
even the meanest punks
would be scared to death.

795
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:27,240
That's how great he was.

796
00:55:27,323 --> 00:55:29,617
I'm honored to work with you.

797
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:30,702
Thank you.

798
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:38,460
If you're curious
or have questions about anything,

799
00:55:38,543 --> 00:55:40,253
you can ask me.

800
00:55:40,336 --> 00:55:42,380
I'm the youngest one here.

801
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:45,300
You are quite young
for a senior public intern.

802
00:55:45,383 --> 00:55:47,177
That's a great smile too.

803
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:49,971
It wasn't that big,

804
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:52,682
but I did have a business
with 30 employees.

805
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:54,142
I'm sure you can tell,

806
00:55:54,225 --> 00:55:59,105
but everyone here
was successful in their primes.

807
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:01,399
Of course, the same goes for me as well.

808
00:56:01,483 --> 00:56:04,861
I promise to work hard
and not cause any inconvenience.

809
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:14,162
Ms. Lim.

810
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:16,873
-Yes?
-The deputy chief's looking for you.

811
00:56:16,956 --> 00:56:17,832
Why?

812
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:19,459
Did you do something wrong?

813
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:21,377
No, not that I can think of.

814
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:23,588
-Can you take this?
-Yeah, go on.

815
00:56:23,671 --> 00:56:24,756
Okay.

816
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:27,926
She shouldn't have meddled so much.

817
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:46,236
Mr. Gye!

818
00:56:47,987 --> 00:56:48,988
Yes?

819
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:55,328
I'll work really hard.

820
00:56:57,622 --> 00:56:58,456
Okay.

821
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:01,626
I promise I'll do my best.

822
00:57:04,003 --> 00:57:05,463
Okay, sure. Keep it up.

823
00:57:06,214 --> 00:57:07,674
You were…

824
00:57:08,883 --> 00:57:10,135
so considerate to me.

825
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:12,428
Thank you so much.

826
00:57:17,433 --> 00:57:19,769
I'll take care of your office from now on.

827
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:21,646
What?

828
00:57:35,326 --> 00:57:36,327
Hello.

829
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:42,292
Where did you get the candy?

830
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:44,752
I got them on my way here.

831
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:46,171
You hate sweets.

832
00:57:47,755 --> 00:57:49,299
That's interesting.

833
00:57:49,382 --> 00:57:52,010
I've seen a lot of people
tell you to shove it,

834
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:54,137
but none of them ever gave you candy.

835
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:05,690
SEOHAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

836
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:30,757
You've cleaned the office so well lately.

837
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,008
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

838
00:58:32,091 --> 00:58:33,343
You work so hard.

839
00:58:36,304 --> 00:58:37,388
Have a nice day.

840
00:58:50,151 --> 00:58:52,403
Pink looks so good on you.

841
00:58:53,071 --> 00:58:54,531
They're new clothes I bought.

842
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:55,949
I see.

843
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:57,742
I see you're going somewhere nice.

844
00:58:58,451 --> 00:58:59,494
Well, yes.

845
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:04,332
Take care.

846
00:59:44,956 --> 00:59:46,457
You haven't started cleaning yet?

847
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:48,209
She said she's here to work.

848
00:59:48,793 --> 00:59:51,129
I see. Let's skip cleaning today.

849
00:59:51,212 --> 00:59:52,213
We're a bit busy.

850
00:59:53,047 --> 00:59:54,799
Well, the thing is…

851
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:57,176
The new office assistant…

852
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:59,178
-Wait, what was it?
-Office aide.

853
01:00:01,055 --> 01:00:02,140
Yeah, that's her.

854
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:03,725
What?

855
01:00:07,228 --> 01:00:09,397
As of today, I'll be here to help you.

856
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,190
I'm your new office aide, Lim Sun.

857
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:14,444
Office aide?

858
01:00:14,527 --> 01:00:15,987
Did that position exist?

859
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:20,617
To be more precise…

860
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:23,036
An office clerk.

861
01:00:23,703 --> 01:00:25,747
Why did you assign me an office clerk?

862
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:26,664
Why?

863
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:28,583
Your office assistant quit.

864
01:00:28,666 --> 01:00:29,542
We're understaffed.

865
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:31,836
But our intern with abundant experience,

866
01:00:31,919 --> 01:00:34,672
a strong will,
and overflowing enthusiasm is…

867
01:00:34,756 --> 01:00:36,424
-An old lady.
-Yes, that lady--

868
01:00:36,507 --> 01:00:37,967
No! Don't say that!

869
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:41,429
Ms. Lim is the perfect fit.

870
01:00:41,512 --> 01:00:42,513
Why is this so slow?

871
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:45,475
Please put this off.

872
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:46,517
Put it off?

873
01:00:46,601 --> 01:00:49,604
You think you can go back and forth
on personnel appointments

874
01:00:49,687 --> 01:00:51,397
however you feel like it?

875
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:54,817
Open your own practice
if you want to pick employees.

876
01:00:55,443 --> 01:00:57,195
A civil servant
can't be biased about staff.

877
01:00:57,278 --> 01:00:59,614
Still, how could you hire an old lady?

878
01:00:59,697 --> 01:01:00,657
She's not an old lady!

879
01:01:02,075 --> 01:01:03,076
Sir…

880
01:01:30,103 --> 01:01:32,480
I'll do my best to support you.

881
01:02:30,621 --> 01:02:33,541
MISS NIGHT AND DAY

882
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:35,918
You're really a civil servant?

883
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:38,087
No, not yet.

884
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:41,340
Since it's come to this,
the best is to have her quit on her own.

885
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:43,468
Organize these into documents before noon.

886
01:02:43,551 --> 01:02:45,470
A lot of chocolate chips.

887
01:02:45,553 --> 01:02:47,096
Don't forget it

888
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:48,848
No way!

889
01:02:49,807 --> 01:02:51,267
Ma'am!

890
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:53,853
I've seen that bag somewhere before.

891
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:55,980
You can trust me.

892
01:02:57,315 --> 01:02:58,900
I want to see.

893
01:02:58,983 --> 01:03:01,527
If I do my best,
I want to see how well I can do.

894
01:03:02,153 --> 01:03:04,155
-Lady.
