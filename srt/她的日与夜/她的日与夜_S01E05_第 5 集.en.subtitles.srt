1
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:45,962
MISS NIGHT AND DAY

2
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,383
What the hell?

3
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:51,634
That's hysterical.

4
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,511
Look at how red his face is!

5
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:55,805
What's this?

6
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,098
My purse.

7
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:58,308
Damn it!

8
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:01,686
What's that?

9
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:10,111
I can't believe this bitch.
You dare play tricks, you bitch?

10
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:12,322
The camera!

11
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,203
What's going on?

12
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:22,332
Let's shoot a real video. Let's do it.

13
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:23,917
-Hey!
-Stop it!

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,168
-What's with you?
-Stop it!

15
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,796
I'm feeling high right now,
so why should I stop?

16
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,047
Ms. Lim!

17
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:32,842
Ms. Lim!

18
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,616
It's empty.

19
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:58,368
Damn it!

20
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:00,328
Emergency! It's a crackdown!

21
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:02,038
-It's the cops!
-What?

22
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,456
Hey! Take the drugs!

23
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,295
-Yes, boss.
-What is it?

24
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:10,588
Let's go. Run!

25
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:16,469
-Who are you?
-What?

26
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,596
-This isn't the bathroom.
-Get out.

27
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,723
That wasn't the bathroom.

28
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,401
What's going on?

29
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,031
The person you are trying to call…

30
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:43,913
Some crazy bastard came here saying
he's a prosecutor from Seohan District.

31
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,082
It was Gye something.

32
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,667
Yes, that's right. Gye Ji-ung.

33
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,717
This is a place of business.
You want to go to jail?

34
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,135
They definitely had drugs.

35
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:08,438
Holy crap!

36
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:15,028
Wow!

37
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:18,907
DRUG PATCH

38
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:21,618
Just a little.

39
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,538
Shit!

40
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:28,249
-My goodness.
-It looks like a rat snuck in.

41
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,879
-Let go.
-I'll gouge your eyes out!

42
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:39,719
You crazy bastard. He's a prosecutor.

43
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:40,720
Well?

44
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:42,639
Are you okay, sir?

45
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:43,973
What do you think?

46
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:49,062
Mr. Gye, you should've said
that you were coming.

47
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:51,022
I would've prepared the VIP room for you.

48
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:53,858
And I would've had
the Diamond Set all ready.

49
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,236
-Where did you take the old lady?
-What? Old lady?

50
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:57,987
We don't have old ladies.

51
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,323
The kitchen staff
even knows not to come out.

52
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:05,370
If you touch a single hair on her head,
you're all dead. Got it?

53
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:07,747
-Yes, boss.
-I'm not your boss.

54
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:15,171
Everyone, take care of the stuff.
We're dead if the prosecutor sees.

55
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:20,218
I was just passing through.

56
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:21,678
You're not going anywhere.

57
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,429
You won't be able to leave here intact.

58
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:24,973
Why are you doing this?

59
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:28,017
Are you a cop?

60
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,102
I'm…

61
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:32,855
I'm a civil servant!
You'll be in big trouble for this.

62
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,109
Civil servant, my foot! Come on.

63
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,904
Damn it! Hey!

64
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,741
Stop right there, you stupid girl!

65
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,076
Damn it!

66
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,287
You little…

67
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:55,169
Get off me!

68
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,131
Why you little…

69
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,300
You want to die?

70
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:08,933
Hey! Come here.

71
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,101
Damn it.

72
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:12,729
Go away! Go!

73
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,067
Are you okay?

74
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:19,944
Seriously!

75
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,821
I promise you this.

76
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:23,573
You won't get out of here alive.

77
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:27,243
Get away from me!

78
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,455
This crazy bitch.

79
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:34,500
Wow, you're making this such a hassle.
Damn it. Hey, come here!

80
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:39,547
-Ms. Lee Mi-jin?
-Mr. Gye.

81
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,591
What are you doing here? Who are you?

82
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:43,926
Are you a prosecutor?

83
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:46,012
Wait. What's going on here?

84
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:48,347
Yes, room three? Okay.

85
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:51,059
The fruit platter's on the way.

86
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:52,935
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

87
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,020
Why are you here?

88
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:57,565
I dropped my phone.

89
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:59,025
-What?
-What?

90
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:03,112
Wait, did you see someone
in a beige coat around here?

91
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,447
No, I didn't.

92
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:07,366
Where did she go?

93
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:10,328
MS. LIM SUN

94
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:23,716
PROSECUTOR GYE JI-UNG

95
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,303
MS. LIM SUN

96
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:31,724
Mr. Gye, I suddenly got
chest pains and left. I'm sorry!

97
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,894
I told her not to come out.

98
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,234
By the way, it's late.

99
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:42,360
Why are you here?

100
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:45,696
Go home now!

101
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:49,200
I want to go home too.

102
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,627
Is it a special day today?

103
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:04,549
Yes, well…

104
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,176
Yes, it is.

105
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,427
What day is it today?

106
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:11,597
Wait.

107
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,396
The doors are closing.

108
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,377
I'm fine though.

109
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,545
Thank you.

110
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,554
Can you hold this for a second?

111
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,934
Thank you for the coat.

112
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,398
-Goodness. I'm so sorry.
-It's okay.

113
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:05,067
Thank you.

114
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:07,945
It's the first floor.

115
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:16,412
CLUB HOVAN
PROPER ATTIRE REQUIRED

116
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:19,665
-Have a good night, boss!
-Good night!

117
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,042
Jeez, that's a bit much.

118
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,044
Please come again, boss.

119
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:25,254
We'll give you
the very best service, boss.

120
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,798
Boss, we'll do whatever you ask next time!

121
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:28,758
I'm the youngest.

122
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:29,967
I can drive you, boss.

123
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:31,886
Mr. Gye!

124
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,349
I could've handled everything
if I'd gone in.

125
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:37,266
I'm sorry.

126
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,143
I think you would've been handled.

127
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:41,395
-Sir?
-Let's go.

128
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,238
Attention!
Greet the prosecutor as he leaves!

129
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:51,781
-Thank you!
-Good night!

130
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,616
Don't do that. Go inside.

131
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:54,700
Stop it.

132
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:57,245
Son of a bitch.

133
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,496
Damn it!

134
00:08:58,579 --> 00:08:59,872
Damn.

135
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:02,792
They know the prosecutors' office
is watching now.

136
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,001
They'll start to move.

137
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,754
We'll have to keep an eye on them.

138
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,675
Are you sure
you don't want to report this?

139
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:13,970
Yes, I'm totally fine.

140
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:18,808
Yes, and we're investigating now,
so it's better to stop here for tonight.

141
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,142
-Yes.
-But…

142
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:24,730
Where's Ms. Lim,
and who's this beautiful young lady?

143
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,900
She suddenly got chest pains.

144
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:33,447
The person saying she was born
in the '90s suddenly had chest pains?

145
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,034
I don't know. Anyway, great work.

146
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,286
I'll escort her home.

147
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:39,370
-What?
-Let's go.

148
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,001
What in the world?

149
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:49,463
Was he really seeing someone?

150
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:55,469
Once again, thank you.

151
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:57,763
Are you really okay?

152
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:00,975
Yes, thanks to you.

153
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:02,935
Do you have
the self-defense tools I gave you?

154
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,520
Of course. Here.

155
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,315
Then, why didn't you use them?

156
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,275
They're for dangerous situations
like today.

157
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:11,736
Well…

158
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:14,238
It feels bad to use them on civilians…

159
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,116
They're not civilians. They're assailants.

160
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,202
But I'm the victim, so why are you…

161
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,123
Are you angry?

162
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,836
I'm not angry, but I'm right.

163
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,881
You said you don't care about others.

164
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,259
But technically, you're not just anyone.

165
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:40,473
Then, who am I?

166
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:43,851
I guess you're a witness,
and I'm your proxy.

167
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:46,646
What is that?

168
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,820
By the way, I'm curious about something.

169
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,114
What did you save me in your phone as?

170
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:01,535
It's just saved as your name.

171
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:02,912
Can you show me?

172
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:06,248
That's fresh coming from someone
who blocked me.

173
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,208
I mean…

174
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:08,793
I know.

175
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,670
So can you show me?

176
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:12,588
Why do you want to see it?

177
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,800
Something's fishy.

178
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:17,593
Let me see.

179
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:19,470
No, I'm driving right now.

180
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:21,639
Okay, since you're driving,

181
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:23,682
I'll check it on my own.

182
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:24,934
I'll see for myself.

183
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,105
DOCUMENTS

184
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,357
Wow!

185
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,901
Wow! "Documents"!

186
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:36,487
Since when was my name "Documents"?

187
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,447
Hello, I'm Lee Documents.

188
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:41,951
I was going to change it later,
but I forgot.

189
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:45,621
That's fresh coming from someone
who scolded me for blocking them.

190
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:48,582
What should I save you as?

191
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,793
Yeah, "Witness" and "Proxy"
seems suitable.

192
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,002
"Witness" and "Proxy."

193
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,921
Jeez, you're so immature.

194
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:55,881
Yes, I'm very immature. I'm Lee Immature.

195
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:03,722
We almost died!

196
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,015
-Are you okay?
-Are you okay?

197
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,058
Yes.

198
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:09,770
-Wait.
-I don't think we can get out.

199
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:12,064
Don't! Stop.

200
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,900
We have to get out of here.
Just wait. Don't be nervous.

201
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,779
Stop! Don't!

202
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,323
-We're in mud.
-Wait.

203
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,534
-Just wait.
-I'll get out too. I'm scared.

204
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:31,083
It's totally stuck.

205
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:34,503
My goodness.

206
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,339
What do we do?

207
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:38,716
Can you drive?

208
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,551
Yes, I have a license.

209
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:42,178
-Get in the driver's seat.
-Me?

210
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:45,014
I'm really getting in then.

211
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,186
-Step on it.
-Okay.

212
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,687
-One, two, three!
-One, two, three!

213
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:55,232
Step on it harder!

214
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:56,400
One, two, three!

215
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:58,569
Harder!

216
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,004
-Goodness!
-Goodness!

217
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:18,923
Mi-jin!

218
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:21,425
-Mom!
-Goodness, my girl! What's going on?

219
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,052
Are you okay? Were you hurt?

220
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,470
-I'm fine.
-Are you…

221
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:27,139
Goodness gracious! What happened to you?

222
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,974
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, Dad.

223
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:32,811
-What happened to your face?
-Ga-yeong practiced putting makeup on me.

224
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,480
I see. But you're okay?

225
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:35,439
-Yeah.
-Okay.

226
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:36,899
You can't go anywhere like this!

227
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,652
Our house is close by.
You can wash up there.

228
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,237
No, that's fine.

229
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,822
No, it's not.
It's not fine with me. Let's go.

230
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,115
Let's hurry.

231
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,701
Yeah, get on.

232
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,958
Honey, step on it.

233
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,292
We should drive safely.

234
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:00,464
-Are they okay back there?
-Yeah, just fine.

235
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:02,466
This is nice.

236
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,386
I would've brought the car had I known.

237
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:07,137
-Right?
-Yeah.

238
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:22,861
I put clothes outside the door,
so you can get changed.

239
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,113
Yes, sir.

240
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:28,117
Stop acting like this.

241
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,952
Also, why do you keep bringing him home?

242
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,705
You wanted me to just send him home
looking like that?

243
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:36,208
You have absolutely no compassion.

244
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,419
No, this will make him more uncomfortable.

245
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:39,461
That's not it!

246
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:42,590
What do we do?

247
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,968
Just shut up and go clean your room.

248
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,595
Why do I have to clean my room?

249
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:51,015
Make sure your body and mind
are always neat and clean!

250
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:52,141
Your room too! Go!

251
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,893
Jeez, you're embarrassing me!

252
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:57,688
I endured for eight years while my one
and only daughter was semi-employed.

253
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:59,064
Why would you be embarrassed?

254
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,399
It's not that.

255
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:02,568
It's embarrassing when you act like this!

256
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:03,569
You brat!

257
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:10,367
My goodness.
Those are the clothes I put in the hamper.

258
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,494
It's a perfect fit. Right, Dad?

259
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:16,206
It must be your good looks,
because those colors really suit you too.

260
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,250
It looks better on him than you!

261
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,295
I'll head out now.

262
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:23,339
Already? You're dripping water!

263
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,257
Honey. Get a plastic bag.

264
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:26,926
-Where?
-The kitchen!

265
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:27,885
The kitchen.

266
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:29,845
I'm sorry.

267
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:32,640
Here you go. Put them in here.

268
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:35,309
-Slowly.
-Okay.

269
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:36,560
Easy.

270
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,021
-Thank you.
-Here you go.

271
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:43,943
Well, I'd really like to make you
something to eat before you go.

272
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:46,695
-Is it too late?
-It's okay. You've done so much already.

273
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,197
Wait!

274
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,406
No, it's fine…

275
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:54,995
Here. Take this with you.

276
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,830
-It's fine.
-Please.

277
00:15:56,914 --> 00:16:00,584
From now on,
saying "It's fine" will be prohibited.

278
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:02,211
Here. Take it.

279
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:04,254
Thank you.

280
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:07,841
You stopped something bad from happening
to Mi-jin at the playground.

281
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:09,843
I wanted to show my thanks.

282
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:11,470
-Playground?
-The playground.

283
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:14,223
The fun, exciting, and spectacular
playground for adults…

284
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:17,685
She's gotten older,
but she's still immature.

285
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:21,021
From now on, don't think
of leaving this house at night. Got it?

286
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,482
-That hurt.
-That's why I hit you.

287
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:26,276
How old are you?
Why would you go to a playground--

288
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,237
What are you doing in front of our guest?

289
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,328
I'll really get going. Thank you.

290
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,372
Yes, of course.

291
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:39,999
-Take care.
-All right.

292
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,334
Good night.

293
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,464
Honey, did you just yell at me?

294
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:55,514
-Mr. Gye!
-Can you help me?

295
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:56,807
I can't open the door.

296
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:02,104
I guess I forgot my jacket.

297
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:03,397
Yes, here.

298
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,565
Put it on top here.

299
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:07,651
I'll do this then.

300
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:11,405
Thank you.

301
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:13,449
About earlier…

302
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:16,368
Thanks for not saying anything to my mom.

303
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:20,414
I unintentionally keep lying
to your parents.

304
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:21,707
I lied about the job scam too.

305
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:25,586
I mean…

306
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:29,715
Well, that's why it's called a white lie.

307
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:32,384
I don't know.
If the lie is only for your sake,

308
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,261
is it still considered a white lie?

309
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:36,638
Can you just let it go?

310
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,058
If I'm not persistent,
I shouldn't be a prosecutor.

311
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,934
Yeah, good for you.

312
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:44,313
-Are you being sarcastic?
-No way. I wouldn't dare.

313
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,565
-I think you are.
-Gosh, no.

314
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:48,692
Being sarcastic would be…

315
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,742
Mr. Gye, those pants
look really good on you.

316
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:58,285
They fit perfectly.

317
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:00,120
You know what? I should tell your parents.

318
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:02,873
I'm really sorry. I mean that.

319
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,001
How does it look?

320
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,795
-I think you're still being sarcastic.
-No.

321
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:11,924
No matter how you look at it,
I think your clothes look better on him.

322
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:14,009
I meant about Mi-jin!

323
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:19,598
Still, he's a prosecutor.

324
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:21,683
So? What's wrong with Mi-jin?

325
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,894
Are you saying
she's not on the same level as him?

326
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:25,729
How could you say that
about your daughter?

327
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:28,148
I can say that because she's my daughter.

328
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:30,901
What if Mi-jin ends up getting hurt?

329
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:33,362
-I'm leaving.
-Good night.

330
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,950
This won't do. You take the back.

331
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:39,493
I'll take the front.

332
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,037
-The back?
-Yeah.

333
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,832
I'll attack first from the front,

334
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:47,417
and you block him
from the back so he can't escape.

335
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,711
Come on. Would that even work?

336
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,260
I just have to block the back, right?

337
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:57,427
-That's right.
-Okay.

338
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:19,426
Wow.

339
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:23,513
Weren't you looking
for a pain-relief patch? Here.

340
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:25,807
Want me to help?

341
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,143
Yeah, right here.

342
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,228
Come here.

343
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,314
Here, Mom.

344
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,358
-Here. Yeah.
-Here?

345
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:37,236
-Is it here?
-Yeah, my shoulder.

346
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:40,072
Goodness gracious.
What have you been doing out there?

347
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:42,783
I was in the middle of work.

348
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:45,160
-Goodness.
-Thanks.

349
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:47,996
Are you happy you're working?

350
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:51,124
Of course.

351
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,126
Then, why are you making that face?

352
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,087
Because it could end someday.

353
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:58,674
What are you saying? You know what's great
about being a civil servant?

354
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,801
You stay employed until retirement.

355
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:05,222
-I'm tired.
-Lie down.

356
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:06,932
-Your legs too?
-Yeah.

357
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:09,893
-Mom?
-Yeah?

358
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:11,478
Now that I'm working,

359
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:15,107
I now understand that saying,
"You're only as old as you feel."

360
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,734
What? Are you saying you're old?

361
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,486
-Why are you old?
-I mean…

362
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:22,990
-The soles of my feet are old.
-Good grief.

363
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:24,491
-They're so tired.
-You brat.

364
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:28,996
Did having a job make you grow up?
How do you know how an old person feels?

365
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:33,792
Right? How would I know
how old people feel?

366
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,085
So weird.

367
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:36,920
Mom, stop. Your wrists will hurt.

368
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,130
Stay still, you brat.

369
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,841
SEOHAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

370
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:46,555
It's about Ms. Lim.

371
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:48,890
If she left because she felt ill,

372
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,310
wouldn't working here
also be too much for her?

373
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:53,020
That's what I think.

374
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:54,771
I wonder if she's okay?

375
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:57,649
I knew it. I should've gone in!

376
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,903
This is why you can't ignore age.

377
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,990
But you couldn't even get in the door.

378
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:08,035
And the original plan
was to go through the back.

379
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:11,621
You couldn't get in there either?

380
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,377
It doesn't matter which door it was.

381
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:22,090
I'll show you how good I am!

382
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:25,469
I'll show you my skills
as an investigator!

383
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:28,221
You heard me, right?
Can you hear me? My skills!

384
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:30,640
I'll show you all my skills!
No need to answer!

385
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:31,767
Because this is…

386
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:48,492
I'm so sorry about last night.

387
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:50,994
We heard you were feeling ill.
How are you?

388
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:55,082
My heart suddenly felt
like it was being squeezed.

389
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:56,083
-Like this.
-Gosh.

390
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:58,376
I think you overstrained yourself.

391
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,795
You look terrible.

392
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,296
Thankfully, I got pictures.

393
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:02,464
Here…

394
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:04,466
Don't overdo it! Take it easy.

395
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:05,926
-Easy.
-It's okay. Sit down.

396
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:07,177
Okay.

397
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:21,066
But I can't see their faces,
so it'll be hard to identify them.

398
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:22,317
What about the VIP room ones?

399
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,444
I was caught then…

400
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:27,614
You were taking these secretly,
so no wonder your heart was taxed.

401
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:30,033
But how did you get in the VIP room?

402
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:33,203
Come on.

403
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:35,163
I told you to leave that room.

404
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,582
Yeah, sure. I'm sure you did.

405
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,960
I said it
since you suddenly said you went in.

406
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:41,586
Yeah, sure. I'm sure you did.

407
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,880
-Like this.
-Are you pushing?

408
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,465
-Let's talk.
-What? Why?

409
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:46,716
Bye.

410
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:50,971
Damn, the quality is…

411
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,849
It looks fine. Can't he tell who it is?

412
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:59,187
Still, it was too much.

413
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,274
You want her to voluntarily quit,
but there's a line.

414
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:05,902
I mean, she was so startled
she had chest pains.

415
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:10,907
Are you saying I made her do this
to kick her out? By myself?

416
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,660
-Isn't it true?
-No!

417
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:16,163
You were in on it with me.
You're so shameless.

418
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:20,167
I wasn't that bad! You did this to her
on your own. Don't lie.

419
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:23,753
Jeez, we'll have to stop her
if she wants to quit now.

420
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:26,339
She's going to keel over before she quits.

421
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:29,050
There's no time for this.
Let's look for their clients.

422
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:34,598
Yeah, sure. Because your work
comes first even in this situation.

423
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:36,892
And don't make any more plans from now on.

424
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,019
Yeah, sure. I'll just do my work.

425
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:44,024
Do senior public interns
clean this area too?

426
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:15,764
The dashboard camera.

427
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:25,732
Mr. Baek, aren't you tired?

428
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:30,862
Goodness, this work is too hard
for someone like you, isn't it?

429
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,614
I bet you're tired.

430
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:34,241
Do you want me to help?

431
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:36,117
I'll gradually get used to it.

432
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,911
Moving around
makes it feel like a workout.

433
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:39,162
It's nice.

434
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:44,376
Gosh, some work to make a living,
while others do it for fun.

435
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,961
Jeez.

436
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:48,922
By the way,
it seems the youngest intern is busy.

437
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:50,340
I haven't seen her around.

438
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:52,676
Why bring her up? She's not even here.

439
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:56,763
She thinks she's important
working for the prosecutor now,

440
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:58,598
and she doesn't hang out with us.

441
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:01,810
She looked young. How incredible of her.

442
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:03,228
She took on office tasks.

443
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:06,564
-Incredible, my foot.
-It is incredible!

444
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:08,483
It's very incredible.

445
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:11,486
She even caught a terrorist
cops or prosecutors couldn't catch!

446
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:14,572
-Fine, it's incredible.
-It is!

447
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:18,952
This place only recognizes skills.
All right?

448
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:21,997
Whatever you did elsewhere
or however successful you were,

449
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,832
it doesn't matter at all.

450
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:25,375
Why not? It's important.

451
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:28,586
-It's so important!
-I used to be successful too!

452
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,046
Who says you weren't?

453
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,674
-So just keep doing your job.
-Why are you yelling at me?

454
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:37,178
-What's going on?
-Who's that?

455
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:44,269
I got the dashcam footage
from the cars as you requested.

456
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:46,896
But why? We already have
high-resolution CCTV footage.

457
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,816
-Ji Dong-kwon's movements are strange.
-They are?

458
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:53,987
I didn't see anything.

459
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:58,074
In past videos, he'd look around
at autograph signing events

460
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,410
and wait for Ko Won
before approaching him.

461
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:02,162
Yeah, that's usually the norm.

462
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:05,040
Inspect the site, find the target,
and commit the crime.

463
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:08,460
-But the sequence was different this time.
-How so?

464
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:22,307
The parking lot is quiet, secluded,
and even allows a way out.

465
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:24,476
Why leave the perfect spot for a crime

466
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:28,229
and choose the crowded area
in front of the lobby?

467
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:31,066
I guess he wanted the world
to see his crime?

468
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:33,401
A normal criminal would've done that,

469
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:38,073
but what would drug addicts
like Ji Dong-kwon be afraid of the most?

470
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,451
-Being unable to do drugs again.
-Okay, then.

471
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,413
Why commit a crime
at the risk of being arrested?

472
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,666
His goal…

473
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:52,253
It wasn't Ko Won.

474
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:57,675
Then, why would he do this?

475
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:00,970
Well…

476
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:06,393
I'm sure only Ji Dong-kwon knows that.

477
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,896
Ko Won wasn't the target
for the acid, was he?

478
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,776
At first, I was sure
you were after Ko Won.

479
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:18,530
You were sentenced to prison thanks to him
and there's immense resentment.

480
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:22,575
But it was actually others
who were harmed.

481
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:25,412
It's all because of her.

482
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:29,374
That damn old lady ruined everything!

483
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:34,170
What the hell are you saying?

484
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,550
Bring Ko Won to me now.

485
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:42,387
I'll kill him for you.

486
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:46,766
After committing such a crime,
you knew it could ruin your life.

487
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:50,687
Did you find a boss
who'd supply you drugs forever?

488
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:52,480
I told you it's not like that…

489
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,317
Are you goddamn deaf?

490
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:01,322
You've been sober,
but you keep talking nonsense.

491
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,074
It sounds like you don't want to talk.

492
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:06,494
I get it, so let's wrap it up.
I think I have my answers.

493
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:07,454
Goodness.

494
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:08,371
Sure.

495
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:13,418
Did you hear something?

496
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:14,961
What?

497
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:16,921
You changed your mind?

498
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:21,009
I'll give you time to think.

499
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:23,887
Why protect a shameless instigator

500
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:26,681
who turned you into a terrorist
for just some drugs?

501
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:45,283
You monitor all the inmates' calls, right?

502
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:47,368
Yes, their calls are all recorded.

503
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:48,870
Called numbers are checked too.

504
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:50,205
Watch him closely.

505
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:52,791
Call me if he shows any strange behavior.

506
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:00,632
I think he knows.

507
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:03,927
Damn it, you still don't get it.

508
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:06,429
I'm about to take the fall for everything!

509
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,308
I won't go down alone.

510
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:12,018
Why the hell would I?

511
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:16,564
Before I expose
why you tried to kill that person,

512
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,150
handle it now.

513
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:37,043
CLEAN UP YOUR OWN MESS

514
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:01,609
The iced coffee lover!

515
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:03,945
Thank you.

516
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,287
I should be thanking you.

517
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:17,333
You didn't give advice,
recommendations, or consolation.

518
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:22,005
I hate "Back in my day" stuff.

519
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,966
And who cares
what strangers say about you?

520
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:26,050
It's not important.

521
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,139
Being obsessed with hate comments.

522
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:33,558
It's pathetic, right?

523
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:37,937
Can I be honest?

524
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:46,070
I'm ready.

525
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:50,742
I thought you were different.

526
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:52,994
You had a comfortable life.

527
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:57,248
Some people out here have it rough,
but you had it made.

528
00:31:57,332 --> 00:32:01,502
The most useless thing to worry about was
a celebrity like you who had an easy life.

529
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:06,132
That's why I think it's hard on you.

530
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:08,509
Because that's how everyone looks at you.

531
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:28,446
Without time to rest

532
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:32,241
Without time to rest

533
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,538
Without time to rest

534
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:41,709
-This isn't it.
-Okay, let's get this down.

535
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:45,213
Wow, he does all that in a week?

536
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:47,507
What? No way. It's his daily schedule.

537
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:48,424
What?

538
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:51,970
Hey, when does he eat and sleep?

539
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,411
You can't see it,

540
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:19,414
but you're trying your best to hold on.

541
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:22,375
People don't know that.

542
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,587
THE FAST TRACK TO BE
A 7TH-GRADE CIVIL SERVANT

543
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:31,759
I worked so hard
and didn't rest for a single day.

544
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:33,344
But…

545
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:38,266
what do I have to show for it?

546
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:43,521
They can't see it, so they say that stuff.

547
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,738
Also, that online troll
will get his punishment.

548
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:55,366
Those who harm others
are destined to have a miserable life.

549
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,122
Everything you say is so typical…

550
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:07,754
but it's nice.

551
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:17,805
Darn it.

552
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:19,974
Look at the time!

553
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:22,518
-I have to go.
-I'll toss it away for you.

554
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:25,563
No, I used to be a cleaning lady.
I can go and do it.

555
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:26,856
Just give it. I got it.

556
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:27,982
-No.
-Give it to me.

557
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,150
That's cold!

558
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:32,361
Just a second. Are you okay?

559
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:33,446
Yes.

560
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:36,407
I'm okay. I just need to wipe a bit more.

561
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:39,494
What's that scar?

562
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:42,705
I got it as a kid
while playing with a cat.

563
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:45,166
I know a plastic surgeon
who's good with scars.

564
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:47,710
Doesn't this look like a heart?

565
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:49,962
It's like my tattoo.

566
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,255
Thanks for today.

567
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:02,308
Hey.

568
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:03,726
Hey, it's me.

569
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:06,521
You said you couldn't stand
being in a remote village

570
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:09,440
filled with terrorists,
so I've been looking into a few things.

571
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:10,525
I want to stay here.

572
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:11,567
What?

573
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:12,902
I like it here.

574
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:14,529
What are you saying?

575
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:17,198
You said you were scared
the terrorist might return.

576
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:20,243
I'm sure someone will help me
if that lunatic shows up again.

577
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:22,036
Who in the world's going to help?

578
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,705
You said first you were bored
and frustrated in the country.

579
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,541
You said you were losing your mind.

580
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:28,334
Yeah, but it's become better.

581
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,379
The water's clean. The air's fresh too.

582
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:36,509
And the people…

583
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:39,387
are good too.

584
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:43,432
Hey, Won. Are you…

585
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:48,563
You know the hardest issues
to deal with… involve women, right?

586
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:53,025
Why won't you answer me?
Won, are you listening?

587
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:55,027
Won? Hey?

588
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:57,363
Hey, I have a favor to ask.

589
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:03,494
What is this? Come on.

590
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:06,539
Guard!

591
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:09,667
Over here! Come quick!

592
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:12,295
Come on!

593
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:13,713
In here!

594
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:17,383
Look at this. Are you insane? Jeez.

595
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:18,634
What's going on?

596
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:20,928
-Did you harass him?
-No way!

597
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,472
He suddenly started to vomit
and shout on his own.

598
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,769
Let's go. Come on.

599
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:30,897
When did this start?

600
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,190
Hold his hands and feet tight!

601
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:33,149
-Yes, doctor!
-Sir!

602
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:35,902
Just a moment.

603
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,446
I'll prepare the shot.

604
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:40,281
Hold him tight!

605
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:41,490
-Yes, sir!
-Hold tight!

606
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:42,950
Hold him down now!

607
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:50,374
That should do it.

608
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:09,977
Don't follow me!

609
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:50,309
Ji-ung, give me the pink lipstick.

610
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:56,565
This is orange.

611
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:00,778
This is pink.

612
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:06,325
Come here.

613
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:11,289
Am I pretty?

614
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:13,457
Of course. You take after me.

615
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:17,878
What?

616
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:20,256
It's a gift for you.

617
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:22,425
Wow, it's a huge diamond ring!

618
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:27,596
The ring I never got from that bastard.

619
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:30,975
But I get one from his son.

620
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,320
I want to come too.
I want to go with you, Mom.

621
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:44,613
Hey! Why am I your mom?

622
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:45,865
Don't call me that!

623
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:47,616
Okay.

624
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,534
Don't follow me.

625
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:52,997
Mom!

626
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,625
Mom.

627
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:05,694
MISSING PERSONS
KANG GYEONG-HUI, NO MI-JA, SEO JI-SUK

628
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:18,040
DAEHO-RI

629
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:21,460
DAEHO MOTEL, PAST
DOGAVILL, PRESENT

630
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,021
This is scaring me to death!

631
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:45,151
Mom!

632
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:46,444
You can't come in here!

633
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:47,862
Mom!

634
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:49,405
How could you let the kid in?

635
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:50,990
Mom!

636
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:58,747
You scared me!

637
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:02,293
-What are you doing here so early?
-What's it look like? I'm working.

638
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,839
You never come to work before 9:00 a.m.
What's the occasion?

639
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,967
To be honest,
my mother-in-law came yesterday

640
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:12,219
with a suitcase that was as big as me.

641
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,805
So I started to wonder

642
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:18,642
about how long I'd have to
come to work early and work overtime for.

643
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:20,186
But don't get the wrong idea.

644
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:22,521
My relationship's great
with my mother-in-law.

645
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:26,275
I adequately fulfill
my duties as a son-in-law.

646
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:28,360
Hello?

647
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:36,202
Okay.

648
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:41,040
Excuse me. Mr. Gye?

649
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:43,626
Mr. Gye?

650
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:49,256
Ji Dong-kwon…

651
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:51,800
is dead.

652
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:00,851
SEOHAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

653
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,397
Goodness!

654
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:07,900
You're a real office worker now.

655
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:08,984
Ms. Na!

656
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:11,445
How's working for the prosecutor?

657
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:13,906
Work's the same wherever you go.

658
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:16,784
You have papers in your hands,
and I have a mop in mine.

659
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:18,953
I wouldn't say it's the same.

660
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:23,374
I meant the mindset
about work was the same.

661
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:27,086
Yeah, and that prosecutor, Gye Ji-ung?

662
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:28,879
-How is he?
-Sorry?

663
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:31,632
The word's spread.
They say he's difficult.

664
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:35,594
Well, I don't know.
He's just skilled and works hard.

665
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:37,263
He's good to me too.

666
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:38,639
Please.

667
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:40,474
They say he's a selfish workaholic.

668
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:44,061
As long as he works hard, does it matter?

669
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:48,440
All right. Let me know
if you have trouble with anything.

670
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:51,652
I'll help you
if it's something I can help with.

671
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:53,279
What are colleagues for?

672
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:55,781
Love thy colleague, love thy country.

673
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:57,992
You're so cool.

674
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:01,161
Yeah, I'm in charge of your old job,

675
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:02,788
so I bet I'm cool.

676
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:04,873
No, it's just…

677
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:10,462
Clean it up. Okay?

678
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,090
Inspector?

679
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:14,842
Is this the cell?

680
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:17,511
We were going to give you
the investigation records.

681
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:20,097
But you actually came? What for, Mr. Gye?

682
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:24,476
Because I have to see it for myself.
That's why.

683
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:32,776
-What was his prison number?
-It was 5204.

684
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,570
Here's a list of his personal belongings.

685
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:39,241
And the time of death?

686
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:41,452
The medical director
will know the details.

687
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:43,871
If it's before roll call,
it would be 9:00 a.m.

688
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:46,373
Can we check
his call history after I left?

689
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:48,000
We already had it printed out.

690
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:49,168
Let's go.

691
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:53,714
This way.

692
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:18,822
CALL HISTORY

693
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:22,493
A few numbers stand out.

694
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:24,953
The number 5412 stands out.

695
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:29,667
If you take a look,
he called this number often recently.

696
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,627
The number you have reached
is not in service.

697
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:32,544
It's disconnected.

698
00:44:33,253 --> 00:44:35,631
He wouldn't have called
a disconnected number.

699
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:38,217
Clearly, it's a number
that can't be tracked.

700
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,302
They must've cut ties
knowing something happened.

701
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:43,847
But how did they learn faster than us?

702
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:50,396
By the way, he must've been
in serious pain before he died.

703
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:53,107
If you look here,
there are signs of vomit.

704
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:56,944
Before he died, he said his stomach hurt
and went to the infirmary.

705
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:58,612
It really was just indigestion.

706
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:01,448
Where's the infirmary?

707
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:02,616
MEDICAL RECORDS

00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:14,420
There will be an autopsy anyway.
Why the fuss?

709
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:16,422
Medical records aren't in autopsies.

710
00:45:18,715 --> 00:45:19,550
Sure.

711
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:23,178
We were told it was just indigestion.

712
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:25,931
But judging by your records,
he was here for a while.

713
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:27,641
You know this.

714
00:45:27,724 --> 00:45:32,438
An inmate will cut their finger
and act as if they're dying, you know?

715
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:36,191
They'd break their own arms
and legs to get outside.

716
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:38,110
It's a relief if they understand.

717
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:42,322
Those who don't understand
must give you a hard time.

718
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:43,407
Yeah.

719
00:45:45,742 --> 00:45:47,870
You won't find much even with the autopsy.

720
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:50,998
Drug addicts go into cardiac arrest
all the time.

721
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:54,543
Please move.

722
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:25,991
He just came and left.

723
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:28,869
I'll prepare the shot.

724
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:31,497
Hold him tight!

725
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:32,498
-Yes, sir!
-Hold tight!

726
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:33,957
Hold him down now!

727
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:48,263
Who cares if they're suspicious?

728
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:50,224
A drug addict died after doing drugs.

729
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:03,946
There was something off
with the medical director.

730
00:47:04,029 --> 00:47:06,698
Someone died,
but did you see how he reacted?

731
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:08,534
It might not be a big deal for him.

732
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:10,744
It's like how murder scenes don't faze us.

733
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:13,789
The autopsy report
needs to come out quickly.

734
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:17,209
Be careful so the victim
doesn't hear of this until then.

735
00:47:17,834 --> 00:47:18,710
Ko Won?

736
00:47:19,127 --> 00:47:21,255
Even if the perpetrator tried to harm him,

737
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:24,174
suddenly learning of his death
could affect him mentally.

738
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:28,595
Are you worried this might shock Ko Won?

739
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:30,889
Media coverage won't help us.

740
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:33,934
How surprisingly kind of you.

741
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:36,770
If only you could be
half as good to people at work too.

742
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:38,814
It's not like I'm bad to people.

743
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:40,566
You aren't good to them either.

744
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:42,693
I'll be on my way.

745
00:47:57,666 --> 00:48:00,669
The prosecutor will be here
in about ten minutes.

746
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:04,923
The deceased perpetrator's case
is a sensitive issue.

747
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:07,509
Okay, thank you.

748
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,224
Coffee delivery.

749
00:48:16,476 --> 00:48:19,104
Did you know I was here alone?

750
00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:20,939
Yes, of course.

751
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:25,777
Did someone die?

752
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:29,489
Did you hear me?

753
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:33,160
Who died?

754
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:35,037
You said it was a perpetrator.

755
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:36,622
Who is it?

756
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:43,045
He'll know anyway when he gets the call.

757
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:49,301
The online troll who tried to hurt you.

758
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:55,641
Are you okay?

759
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:58,518
Ko Won? I shouldn't have told you.

760
00:49:01,938 --> 00:49:02,856
He died?

761
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:06,234
My goodness.

762
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:09,613
What do I do?

763
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:23,627
We need to talk.

764
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:26,630
Go in first.

765
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:28,173
Okay, if you'll excuse me.

766
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:35,055
I'm not sure what it's about,
but let's be brief.

767
00:49:36,848 --> 00:49:38,016
I heard he died.

768
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:44,731
Was it suicide?

769
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:49,236
Who told you?

770
00:49:52,864 --> 00:49:54,074
By any chance…

771
00:49:57,035 --> 00:49:58,286
did he die because of me?

772
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:03,709
Did he die because of me?

773
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:22,477
Who told the victim
about the suspect's death?

774
00:50:23,478 --> 00:50:25,313
It didn't leak from here, did it?

775
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:30,777
He seemed so uneasy,
so I wanted to reassure him--

776
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:32,320
Is your job

777
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:34,948
to interpret and give meaning
to whatever you want?

778
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:36,199
In any case,

779
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:40,078
he'd find out when they file
the paperwork to drop the charges.

780
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:44,040
His legal representatives
could've received that paperwork.

781
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:45,125
I know that, but--

782
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:48,170
Is that all you know?
The investigation isn't over yet.

783
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:51,882
Did you even consider how the suspect's
death would upset the victim?

784
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:56,344
I'm sorry.

785
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:58,597
What if the autopsy
reports it as a suicide?

786
00:50:59,055 --> 00:51:01,349
How can the victim handle that
while working here?

787
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:02,392
How?

788
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:04,978
Sir, I think she told him without knowing.

789
00:51:05,061 --> 00:51:06,521
-That's enough.
-I mean…

790
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:32,798
Why would I be upset?

791
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:35,717
He was totally right.

792
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:41,556
I'm not even a real office assistant.

793
00:51:43,099 --> 00:51:44,434
Or an investigator.

794
00:51:45,727 --> 00:51:46,645
I'm just…

795
00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:50,899
Lee Mi-jin, an insignificant job seeker.

796
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:55,821
Nothing more, nothing less. Just that.

797
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:02,869
This is why I don't like
working with people

798
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:05,288
who are old, inexperienced, and chatty.

799
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:07,958
But you wanted to delay her quitting.

800
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:09,876
She's been working pretty hard.

801
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,795
What's the point? She's not helpful.

802
00:52:12,504 --> 00:52:14,172
I was the only one who was happy.

803
00:52:14,714 --> 00:52:17,133
Like a fool, I was so excited.

804
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:19,302
I finally got to work.

805
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:22,639
Organize these legal precedents
into documents before noon.

806
00:52:22,722 --> 00:52:25,141
Organize our accounting records in Excel.

807
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:27,936
Attach the necessary quarterly statements
and the annual plan

808
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:29,479
and save them to the shared folders.

809
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:32,357
Give this to him in person.
Having him appear would be best.

810
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:36,111
I didn't know anything

811
00:52:36,194 --> 00:52:38,238
and was so excited. Damn it.

812
00:52:39,072 --> 00:52:40,115
I'm such a moron.

813
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:46,913
What do you want me to do?

814
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:49,708
You should've made me totally old!

815
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:51,418
Like an elderly, hunched lady.

816
00:52:51,793 --> 00:52:54,170
Then, I wouldn't have tortured myself
with hope!

817
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:57,132
What can I do looking like this?

818
00:52:57,841 --> 00:53:01,803
Why in the world
did you make me like this? Why?

819
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:08,184
To be honest, I already knew.

820
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:12,355
Who asked you to do this?

821
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:15,525
They keep legal precedents as records?

822
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:17,402
That's a first.

823
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:21,948
But why would you do this?

824
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:25,035
We don't need to organize
accounting records like this.

825
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:29,873
-Take them.
-I'm sure they asked since they needed it.

826
00:53:29,956 --> 00:53:30,999
-I see.
-Thank you.

827
00:53:31,082 --> 00:53:31,917
You're welcome.

828
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:36,546
Why would you serve a summons in person?
You're not a postal worker.

829
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:42,010
SEOHAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

830
00:53:43,219 --> 00:53:45,138
I pretended like I didn't know.

831
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:49,517
I was barely hanging onto the job.

832
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:52,312
I didn't want it to disappear.

833
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:37,190
The wind is blowing

834
00:54:38,566 --> 00:54:39,401
Damn it.

835
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:42,612
Who the hell drank it all?

836
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:45,490
I drank it all

837
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:49,077
I drank all of it

838
00:54:56,584 --> 00:54:58,628
Why is time moving so fast?

839
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:07,262
What if my mom and dad

840
00:55:08,346 --> 00:55:10,724
become really old?

841
00:55:16,938 --> 00:55:19,858
They can't get older than me.

842
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:29,826
What if I grow old and never get married?

843
00:55:31,244 --> 00:55:32,996
That would…

844
00:55:34,956 --> 00:55:37,292
upset me so much.

845
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:52,807
Two, three, four, six, seven, eight.

846
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:55,477
What? Damn it.

847
00:55:58,772 --> 00:55:59,689
Damn it.

848
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:02,692
Is this it?

849
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:05,278
I know it's right. Ga-yeong!

850
00:56:05,361 --> 00:56:06,905
Why won't you open up?

851
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:13,244
Ga-yeong! I'm here!

852
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:14,829
I know you're home.

853
00:56:16,581 --> 00:56:17,665
Ga-yeong!

854
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:18,958
Ga-yeong?

855
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:23,922
Ga-yeong!

856
00:56:25,298 --> 00:56:27,634
Ga-yeong, why won't you open the door?

857
00:56:39,395 --> 00:56:41,022
I've got a way.

858
00:56:45,401 --> 00:56:47,195
Shit! My goodness!

859
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:50,824
What's this? What's wrong with it?

860
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:52,867
What's going on?

861
00:56:55,411 --> 00:56:56,412
What in the world?

862
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:02,085
What's going on?

863
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:14,055
Who are you?

864
00:57:15,056 --> 00:57:16,015
Excuse me?

865
00:57:18,226 --> 00:57:19,519
-Ms. Lee Mi-jin?
-Yes?

866
00:57:20,186 --> 00:57:21,604
What? Are you sleeping here?

867
00:57:22,355 --> 00:57:23,398
Wake up.

868
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:25,233
Please get up.

869
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:28,361
What are you doing?

870
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:30,071
This isn't the right house.

871
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:31,656
Wait, Ms. Lee Mi-jin.

872
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:40,540
Did you wreck the door?

873
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:48,840
-Ms. Lee Mi-jin!
-Yes?

874
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:01,227
I told her it was dangerous,
but she goes and drinks alone.

875
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:05,773
She really doesn't listen. What?

876
00:58:06,566 --> 00:58:07,775
Please wake up.

877
00:58:09,861 --> 00:58:14,115
My stomach feels terrible.
I think I might throw up.

878
00:58:15,116 --> 00:58:16,576
I'll see if I have medicine.

879
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:21,289
Don't wear those glasses!

880
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:25,168
-What?
-You look like such a jerk with them on.

881
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:29,422
-What?
-Jeez, I said you look like a jerk.

882
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:33,009
They turn you into a jerk,
so just throw them away!

883
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:37,055
See?

884
00:58:37,138 --> 00:58:39,599
You look much better without glasses.

885
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:41,017
Seriously?

886
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:44,896
-Look here.
-What?

887
00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:48,900
Don't look down on me.

888
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:52,570
Damn it.

889
00:58:53,655 --> 00:58:55,490
What is it? Well?

890
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:57,784
You're selfish.

891
00:58:58,284 --> 00:59:00,328
You're mean too.

892
00:59:00,411 --> 00:59:01,913
You're so rude.

893
00:59:03,414 --> 00:59:06,918
But what a waste of a face.

894
00:59:07,001 --> 00:59:08,461
Let go of me.

895
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:03,933
I'll trust you, so keep your promise.

896
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:55,818
What in the world?

897
01:01:00,114 --> 01:01:01,783
You're up earlier than I thought.

898
01:01:03,451 --> 01:01:05,078
Drink this and get it together.

899
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:13,336
What are you doing here, Mr. Gye?

900
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:15,046
This is my place.

901
01:01:15,129 --> 01:01:16,130
Your place?

902
01:01:18,049 --> 01:01:18,883
But…

903
01:01:20,051 --> 01:01:22,011
I went to my friend's house

904
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:24,138
last night.

905
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:27,266
Where am I?

906
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:28,935
My place. My apartment.

907
01:01:29,018 --> 01:01:30,019
Your place?

908
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:32,105
Dogavill, Apartment 403?

909
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:33,314
I'm Apartment 303.

910
01:01:33,898 --> 01:01:34,732
Apartment 303?

911
01:01:41,239 --> 01:01:43,658
I'm so sorry. Last night…

912
01:01:43,741 --> 01:01:46,119
I drank too much
and thought this was my friend's place.

913
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:47,537
I mistakenly came in. I'm sorry.

914
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:50,289
You were pretty drunk.
You reeked of alcohol as well.

915
01:01:51,249 --> 01:01:53,126
I'm sorry. I'll go now.

916
01:02:01,342 --> 01:02:02,552
What's going on?

917
01:02:03,302 --> 01:02:05,179
I forgot to tell you.

918
01:02:05,263 --> 01:02:08,182
Some drunk person destroyed
my door lock last night.

919
01:02:09,016 --> 01:02:10,017
Ga-yeong!

920
01:02:12,478 --> 01:02:14,188
Shit! My goodness me!

921
01:02:15,606 --> 01:02:19,318
I'm sorry. But you're not saying
we can't get out, are you?

922
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:20,945
I had my doubts too at first.

923
01:02:21,028 --> 01:02:23,364
I don't know what you did,
but it doesn't work.

924
01:02:23,448 --> 01:02:25,783
-What do we do?
-We wait for the repairman.

925
01:02:25,867 --> 01:02:28,119
-When's he coming?
-When they open.

926
01:02:28,202 --> 01:02:29,954
-So 9:00 a.m. at the earliest--
-No!

927
01:02:35,126 --> 01:02:37,795
I mean, I have something
very urgent to do today.

928
01:02:37,879 --> 01:02:39,464
I have to go right now.

929
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:41,215
Should we break the door down?

930
01:02:41,299 --> 01:02:43,301
-Can you do that?
-Seriously?

931
01:02:43,384 --> 01:02:45,261
Please open the door! Seriously!

932
01:02:45,344 --> 01:02:47,722
I have to go before the sun rises!

933
01:02:47,805 --> 01:02:48,931
How? It's broken.

934
01:02:49,015 --> 01:02:51,517
You broke it.
Why are you going in there?

935
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:53,144
No!

936
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:56,898
Where are you going?

937
01:03:01,694 --> 01:03:02,737
What's wrong?

938
01:03:04,363 --> 01:03:05,698
-What is she doing?
-I…

939
01:04:04,006 --> 01:04:06,926
MISS NIGHT AND DAY

940
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:09,345
Did you get in a fight?

941
01:04:09,428 --> 01:04:10,888
It looks like they aimed for it.

942
01:04:10,972 --> 01:04:13,349
Just leave the money and go
while we're being nice.

943
01:04:16,769 --> 01:04:18,062
I said…

944
01:04:19,146 --> 01:04:20,481
I'll interpret it.

945
01:04:20,565 --> 01:04:21,858
A grand plan.

946
01:04:21,941 --> 01:04:24,861
We need your exceptional skills.

947
01:04:25,486 --> 01:04:27,029
Goodness.

948
01:04:27,738 --> 01:04:29,448
Do you have time to meet up?

949
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:31,409
I didn't know
we'd get along this well either.

950
01:04:31,492 --> 01:04:33,119
Let's really do our best.

951
01:04:33,995 --> 01:04:35,496
For a long time, if possible.

952
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:43,004
