1
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:45,962
MISS NIGHT AND DAY

2
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:02,145
-What in the world?
-You're up earlier than I thought.

3
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:06,149
Drink this and get it together.

4
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,777
What are you doing here, Mr. Gye?

5
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:09,819
This is my place.

6
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,196
Your place?

7
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:14,699
But I went
to my friend's house last night.

8
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:15,909
Dogavill, Apartment 403?

9
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:16,993
I'm Apartment 303.

10
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:18,411
Apartment 303?

11
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:23,833
I'm so sorry. Last night…

12
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:26,044
I drank too much
and thought this was my friend's place.

13
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:27,462
I mistakenly came in. I'm sorry.

14
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:30,423
You were pretty drunk.
You reeked of alcohol as well.

15
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,050
I'm sorry. I'll go now.

16
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:39,015
What's going on?

17
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:40,308
What's wrong with this?

18
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,602
I forgot to tell you.

19
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:45,814
Some drunk person destroyed
my door lock last night.

20
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:47,607
Ga-yeong!

21
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,318
Ga-yeong!

22
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:51,611
Why won't you open up?

23
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:56,116
Shit! My goodness!

24
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:01,663
I'm sorry. But you're not saying
we can't get out, are you?

25
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:03,331
I had my doubts too at first.

26
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:05,750
I don't know what you did,
but it doesn't work.

27
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:08,336
-What do we do?
-We wait for the repairman.

28
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,505
-When's he coming?
-When they open.

29
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:12,465
-So 9:00 a.m. at the earliest--
-No!

30
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:20,265
I mean, I have something
very urgent to do today.

31
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:21,808
I have to go right now.

32
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:23,560
Should we break the door down?

33
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,728
-Can you do that?
-Seriously?

34
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,730
Please open the door! Seriously!

35
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,108
I have to go before the sun rises!

36
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:31,359
How? It's broken.

37
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:33,778
You broke it.
Why are you going in there?

38
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,238
No!

39
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:37,949
What?

40
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:43,913
What's wrong?

41
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,250
-What is she doing?
-I…

42
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:57,093
What are you doing?

43
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,722
Hey, are you insane?

44
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:01,973
Sir! I'm going to fall!

45
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:03,224
-Let go!
-Come down!

46
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,643
-I'm going to fall!
-It's dangerous! Come down!

47
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,061
-Come down, okay?
-Let go.

48
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:08,396
This is more dangerous.

49
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:09,856
Mr. Gye!

50
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,482
Hello, 911?

51
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:12,984
This is Dogavill, Apartment 303.

52
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:14,068
I'm sorry!

53
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:17,530
Gosh, I'm so sorry!

54
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,908
I'm sorry. Just a moment.

55
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:23,202
Wait! Someone's in danger,
so can you come right now?

56
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,455
Don't call 911. Okay, I made it.

57
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,582
I'm here! Here I go!

58
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:30,543
Never mind.

59
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,421
Ms. Lee Mi-jin.

60
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:35,340
Excuse me?

61
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,385
Ga-yeong!

62
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:44,766
Open the door.

63
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:47,185
The door!

64
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:49,604
What's going on?

65
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,774
It's so early in the morning!
What is she doing?

66
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:54,525
What in the world?

67
00:03:58,321 --> 00:03:59,447
Open the door.

68
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,241
What are you doing?

69
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,538
What are you doing? Why are you here?

70
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,624
Close the door! Close it!

71
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,922
How did you get up there?

72
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:17,048
I almost died.

73
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,426
What's with you?

74
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,095
What's wrong with you?

75
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:23,638
Hey…

76
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,442
Goodness, Ga-yeong.

77
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:37,902
Give me some water.

78
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:44,325
Damn.

79
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:46,202
Damn it.

80
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:53,334
You've gone
and lost your mind, haven't you?

81
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:57,714
So you went to the wrong place
because you were drunk?

82
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:01,509
But that happened to be
the prosecutor's place?

83
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,138
Are you insane?

84
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:06,097
Gosh.

85
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,141
I know. Of all places…

86
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,728
Doesn't he know the place is haunted?

87
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,730
Are you worrying about him right now?

88
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,481
I don't know.

89
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,150
I don't want to think about it.

90
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,861
As of now, I have amnesia.

91
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:21,946
Wait.

92
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,032
If you got drunk,

93
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:26,951
you should've just gone to bed,
but why come to my place?

94
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,161
Hey, friend.

95
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:31,164
I came here because I drank alcohol.

96
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:34,542
If my parents saw me
like this while drunk…

97
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,336
Where did you drink all this alcohol?

98
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:37,837
At home alone.

99
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:39,881
Did something happen?

100
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:42,425
Something happened.

101
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:44,677
What am I going to do?

102
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:45,845
Well, what can we do?

103
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:48,806
For now…

104
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,767
Hide it from your parents and--

105
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,226
It's not that.

106
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,896
It's the prosecutor.

107
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:57,023
What do I do if he thinks I'm weird?

108
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:00,485
Damn it, what do I tell him?

109
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,529
What if he asks me
why I climbed out the window?

110
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:07,158
Should I say it's an occasional hobby?

111
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,036
He wouldn't believe me.

112
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:12,246
What do I do? Damn it!

113
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,459
What is it? Hey.

114
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:20,546
Don't look at me like that.

115
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,672
Stop it.

116
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,344
-Come on.
-Right?

117
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,806
They say even flowers
can bloom in the desert.

118
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,808
What are you talking about?

119
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,268
Stop it. Don't.

120
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:36,270
You brat.

121
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:38,564
What is it?

122
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:39,565
I got the sign.

123
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:42,401
It's time to poop.

124
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:44,237
Wait. My phone.

125
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,617
Did you eat kimchi ramyeon?

126
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:54,914
You're always watching TV shows
when you poop.

127
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:56,582
That's why you're constipated.

128
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:57,667
Damn.

129
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,214
He wouldn't come up here.

130
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:05,258
Should I eat some ramyeon first?

131
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:11,180
Ga-yeong, someone's here.

132
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,020
Hey!

133
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:21,190
-Open the door.
-Why?

134
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,608
He's here.

135
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,193
He came from downstairs!

136
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,403
Come on out!

137
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:28,156
Hey, I can't stop right now.
Why don't you just go?

138
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:30,783
Gosh, what do I do?

139
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,577
Should I call and tell him to go?

140
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,913
-What do I do?
-Just cover you face and get out there!

141
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:38,499
Wait a second. Did he leave?

142
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:47,550
Excuse me.

143
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,011
I'm busy, so just leave.

144
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,306
Ms. Lee Mi-jin?

145
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,310
You left your belongings.

146
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,563
Just leave it there.

147
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:02,523
Okay.

148
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:34,972
-Ms. Lim!
-No way!

149
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:36,766
What are you doing here?

150
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,227
Why would I be here?

151
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:42,730
-What?
-Nothing. Do you live here?

152
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:46,651
She's my aunt.

153
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:48,236
My niece.

154
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:51,239
I live in Apartment 403.
I'm Do Ga-yeong, Mi-jin's friend.

155
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,406
Hello.

156
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:54,909
Then, where's Lee Mi-jin?

157
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,287
-She's taking a dump.
-Taking a what?

158
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:00,748
She's pooping.

159
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:03,626
Do you want me to get her? Mi-jin!

160
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:06,003
-Mi-jin!
-Someone's here for you.

161
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,630
Are you going to take long?

162
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:08,923
Come on out here.

163
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,676
-She must be constipated.
-That's right.

164
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,010
I think it'll be a while.

165
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:16,055
Should we tell her to call you
when she's done?

166
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,307
No, it's fine. There's no need.

167
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,517
Have a nice day.

168
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:21,477
Wait, is that…

169
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:22,770
What is that?

170
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:24,355
She said her stomach hurt.

171
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,399
Could you give this to her?

172
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,778
Okay, I'll make sure she gets it.

173
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,154
Have a good day.

174
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,365
-She told me you were kind.
-That's enough.

175
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:35,408
Excuse me?

176
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:37,243
Mi-jin often spoke of Mr. Gye--

177
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:39,704
I mean, she said so much about you--

178
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,790
-What?
-For crying out loud!

179
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:45,167
A fly went into your mouth.

180
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:50,590
This girl…

181
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,758
She's so funny.

182
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:54,885
Take care.

183
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:56,387
Goodbye.

184
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,856
Stop laughing.

185
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,275
You don't like him?

186
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:10,818
Even though you're acting like this?

187
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:12,320
Seriously, I don't…

188
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:13,404
It's not true.

189
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:14,322
Holy cow!

190
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:19,201
Sure, I could have good feelings
about him because he helped me.

191
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,662
But don't you know me?

192
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,664
I'm really good at knowing my place.

193
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,249
What are you talking about?

194
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,043
What's so bad about you?

195
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:30,379
Jeez, I already had a
gloomy life that wasn't special,

196
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,797
and then I suddenly became old.

197
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,716
You actually think I seem normal?

198
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:35,384
Hey.

199
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:39,430
Why put yourself down like that?
I just said it for fun.

200
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:40,431
Stop it.

201
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:43,559
It's only fun when you know
you have a chance.

202
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,102
Seriously,

203
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,104
it's not like I have talents like you.

204
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:50,566
I'm not good at anything.
So why cause harm to others?

205
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,360
I hate that more than anything.

206
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,946
Why are you being so serious?

207
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,157
Hey.

208
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,158
Stop it.

209
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:01,285
Where did you get that hat?

210
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,871
-Your room.
-You came out like this?

211
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:04,789
Yeah.

212
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,501
Look at your fashion sense.
You're a catch.

213
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:11,003
There weren't any clothes
in your laundry basket.

214
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,422
Is your name Sancho? From Mexico?

215
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:22,890
Did she say she knew her?

216
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,437
Is that all you know?
The investigation isn't over yet.

217
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:32,233
Did you even consider how the suspect's
death would upset the victim?

218
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,111
I'm sorry.

219
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:47,623
Why did Mom call me so much?

220
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,210
CALL HISTORY
PROSECUTOR GYE JI-UNG

221
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:52,378
What?

222
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:53,921
-Why did I do that?
-What?

223
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:55,589
What did you do this time?

224
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,676
I drunk-dialed him.

225
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,344
Why did I call him?

226
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,596
From which number? You have two.

227
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,473
-Mine.
-Yeah, which one?

228
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,600
I mean, Lee Mi-jin's number.

229
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:09,353
Did you talk about Lim Sun as Lee Mi-jin?

230
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:10,729
I don't remember.

231
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,189
Give me your phone.

232
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:18,946
Hey, you talked for 30 minutes
and you don't remember?

233
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,030
I don't remember.

234
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,992
Do you remember how you got here?

235
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,493
I said I don't remember.

236
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,454
You crazy bitch. Go and die.

237
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:29,081
I must be insane!

238
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,458
-Should I just die?
-Hey.

239
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,751
Don't do that to your hair.
You'll go bald!

240
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,003
There's already a spot.

241
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,464
Is blacking out a symptom of dementia?

242
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,966
You always black out
when you drink too much.

243
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:41,594
Also, it's better
if you don't remember this.

244
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:44,096
If you were obnoxious,
how would you face him at work?

245
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,432
Seriously!

246
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:51,312
It's hot.

247
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:52,771
Are you in menopause?

248
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,064
What?

249
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,357
You're all over the place.

250
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:57,401
Seriously, I feel so…

251
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:58,819
What am I going to do?

252
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:01,530
Okay, this won't do.

253
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:02,698
-Mi-jin?
-Yeah?

254
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:05,493
I'll make you feel better.

255
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:06,577
How?

256
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,914
Clear your schedule this weekend.

257
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:12,082
Should I drink another one?

258
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,417
Go ahead.

259
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,170
SEOHAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

260
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:19,048
FOR ALL REQUESTS, PLEASE TAKE A NUMBER
AND WAIT FOR YOUR TURN

261
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:27,348
But he died.

262
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,309
He's dead.

263
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:33,395
Who's in charge?

264
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:37,942
Come out or else!

265
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:40,694
If you don't, you're all dead!

266
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,238
Sir, please calm down.

267
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,906
Please tell us what you're--

268
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,158
Just because I didn't pay
some measly fines,

269
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,035
you freeze my bank account?

270
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:49,870
Are you insane? Seriously?

271
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:50,788
Sir.

272
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:52,665
I can help you with that.

273
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:54,083
How are you going to help?

274
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,417
You must calm down first.

275
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,795
-What?
-Over here, please.

276
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:00,256
What are you doing? Let go!

277
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,466
-Calm down.
-Let go of me!

278
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,020
Damn it.

279
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,456
Where's my medication?

280
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,624
Medication?

281
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,584
For your anxiety?

282
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,252
You told me to get rid of them.

283
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:40,254
Damn it.

284
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:18,584
Ms. Lim?

285
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,086
Hello.

286
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:26,800
You said before that I could ask you
if I was curious about something.

287
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:29,345
Of course. What is it?

288
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:34,433
It's about the person
who held this position before I did.

289
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:37,478
You can speak informally.
I'm the youngest here.

290
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:41,023
-With more comfort comes more respect.
-I see.

291
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:44,777
But what about Ko Na-heun?

292
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:47,655
I was wondering why he quit.

293
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,616
He was absent without notice,

294
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:53,118
so in line with our contracts,
he was let go.

295
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:59,541
I felt bad because I thought
I'd stolen this job from someone in need.

296
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,001
-I see.
-By any chance…

297
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,420
Something didn't happen, did it?

298
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,005
What do you mean?

299
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:14,890
Never mind.

300
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,517
Okay.

301
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,602
-Let's get back to work.
-Okay.

302
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,314
AUTOPSY REPORT

303
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,821
PRESUMED TO BE ASIAN MALE IN HIS SIXTIES

304
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,324
-A man?
-I know.

305
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:33,826
I was really surprised too.

306
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:36,829
I thought it was a woman
from the size of the footprint.

307
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,331
Did you see the victim's presumed age?

308
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:49,591
What type of SUV tires
do you normally put on?

309
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,011
We have all sorts of brands.

310
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,262
We have all of them.

311
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:56,849
Yes, Ms. Tak?

312
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:59,768
"Cause of death unknown."
"Unable to identify murder weapon."

313
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,353
Why wasn't anything found?

314
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:02,980
Well, I think

315
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:05,983
conducting an autopsy
with a single body part has limits.

316
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:10,029
-How's the investigation?
-Well, we haven't found anything yet.

317
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:12,865
We're investigating
with the tire track results.

318
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:14,825
We'll be able to identify
the suspect soon.

319
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:18,412
Fentanyl found in the blood test
wasn't a lethal dose.

320
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:22,166
It's just as Mr. Gye had said.
We're going through the medical records.

321
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:23,751
Why would Mr. Gye know that?

322
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,628
Wait, how does he know that?

323
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:27,880
He asked for it.

324
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:29,715
He saw the autopsy report too?

325
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:31,300
Just the blood test results.

326
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:33,927
Detective Kwon.

327
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:37,514
From now on, don't tell anyone else
who's not involved with the case.

328
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:40,726
Damn it.

329
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:43,896
What's with her?

330
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:48,442
-Sir.
-Yes?

331
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,320
It's about plate number 60B38.

332
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:54,865
If you look at the forensic report,
the back tires were different.

333
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:56,742
They put on different ones from the front.

334
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,869
These are Noble Tires.

335
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:01,830
Mid-sized SUVs
are usually fitted this way.

336
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,248
Is that so?

337
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:06,668
That narrows it down.

338
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,921
Thank you, sir.

339
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:16,428
-Is that jerk here?
-Why would a jerk be here?

340
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:17,387
Damn it.

341
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,307
Come on. You're friends,
but you shouldn't call him that.

342
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,518
Then, what should I call him?

343
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,728
Whether by experience or rank,

344
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,481
he's your superior,
so even if you can't be formal,

345
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:29,274
at least show basic common courtesy.

346
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:31,485
You're saying I lack the basics?

347
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:35,781
I didn't mean to hit a nerve,
but that seemed to have hurt.

348
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:42,538
Lady, is that funny to you?

349
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:51,296
What is that cactus?

350
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,965
Did Gye give that to you?

351
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,342
Address her properly.

352
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:57,136
It's not "lady" but Ms. Lim.

353
00:18:58,303 --> 00:18:59,638
What fight are you picking now?

354
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,269
What about it? I gave it to her.

355
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:07,896
Damn it.

356
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:16,613
Have a nice day.

357
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:22,703
Some things never change.
He still looks down on people!

358
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:25,622
That lady's ridiculous too.

359
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,749
He gives you a gift and you take it?

360
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:28,750
Damn it.

361
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,504
They all suck!

362
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:46,226
I'm sorry.

363
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,604
You got in trouble because of me.

364
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:50,230
For what?

365
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:53,150
I felt bad about throwing out
a living plant,

366
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:54,943
so I planted it in there.

367
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:59,156
You did well.
It would've died in a week at my desk.

368
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,490
You've got a green thumb.

369
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:02,784
It's bloomed too.

370
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,627
This is Danmuji.

371
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,212
You even named it.

372
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:15,881
I grew attached while growing it.

373
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,052
Why are you putting it here?

374
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:21,470
You should try tending to it.

375
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,096
No, that's okay.

376
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:26,266
It was your cactus to start with.

377
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,977
It's all settled now.
Just manage the humidity.

378
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:30,771
And it'll endure.

379
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:32,439
Still, I don't think I can.

380
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,274
Really, it's okay…

381
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,463
Sir, the documents you asked for…

382
00:20:58,882 --> 00:20:59,800
What's with your face?

383
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:03,262
Did you get in a fight? Did you get hit?

384
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,473
Hello, 911?

385
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:08,058
This is Dogavill, Apartment 303.

386
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:09,226
I'm sorry!

387
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:12,062
Gosh, I'm so sorry!

388
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:14,189
Yeah, I got hit pretty hard.

389
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,232
Goodness.

390
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,943
Why are you going around getting hit?

391
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:19,236
Apply this often.

392
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:22,364
It looks like they aimed for it.

393
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,369
They definitely got me.

394
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:28,662
I was cursed out too.

395
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:31,498
You must've met a powerful trash talker.

396
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:38,630
I've been cursed out before,
and it's never bothered me.

397
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:42,676
But what I heard really shook me.

398
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:46,138
Don't wear those glasses!

399
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:49,641
-What?
-You look like such a jerk with them on.

400
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:53,270
I need to stop drinking so much.

401
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:55,522
Seriously!

402
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:59,568
Still, after I really ripped into him,

403
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,111
it must've been effective.

404
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,864
Whatever.

405
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:05,157
Let's just quit.

406
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:10,454
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

407
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,628
Someone saw the flyer and called.

408
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:21,715
Who? Did they see the cat?

409
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:24,509
Holy cow. They have the cat!

410
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,970
Tell them you want to meet right now!

411
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,138
I'll go.

412
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:29,806
But you're working. Is it okay?

413
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:34,561
That's not important now.
I'm almost done. I'll go straight there.

414
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:36,897
Okay, I'll give you the number.

415
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:39,316
Okay, thanks.

416
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:45,739
-Excuse me. I'm sorry, but--
-Yes?

417
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:53,455
It's been a while.
Should we all leave on time today?

418
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:55,082
My mother-in-law's at home.

419
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:58,877
I'm working overtime this week.
Let's get some stew for dinner together.

420
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,003
I'll pass on dinner.

421
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:01,880
-Can we talk--
-Goodbye.

422
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:05,050
Wait. Can we talk for a moment? Can…

423
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:07,219
How about some pork stew?

424
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:10,639
Enough with the stews.
You gave me strange meds too.

425
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:23,068
No!

426
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:25,737
Damn it.

427
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:27,739
What?

428
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,756
This umbrella…

429
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:48,760
Someone left this on my desk.

430
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:51,346
Since it was my desk, I guess it's mine.

431
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:56,643
Was there something
you wanted to talk about?

432
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:00,730
Well, the thing is

433
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:04,484
people can unintentionally
say things by mistake.

434
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:07,737
Is this because I drunk-dialed him?

435
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:09,072
What was said in anger--

436
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:10,490
Wait!

437
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:12,826
Anyone can say something by mistake.

438
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:15,871
No one's perfect, right?

439
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:17,539
To persistently harp on someone

440
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:19,916
for one little slip of the tongue
is so harsh.

441
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,170
As an intellectual, shouldn't you be
generous and understanding

442
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:25,714
of mistakes made by those
who are less competent?

443
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:28,925
I didn't think you were like this,

444
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:31,094
but you're really…

445
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:33,638
You have an admirable attitude.

446
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:36,641
You're so accepting
of everything you hear.

447
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,977
You're generous,
and you don't hold grudges.

448
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,354
You really are an intellectual.

449
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:43,023
My goodness.

450
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:47,360
I didn't know you were so understanding.

451
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:50,906
I didn't know
we'd get along this well either.

452
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,075
To tell you the truth,

453
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,037
I wasn't sincere back then
when I said I hoped we'd get along.

454
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:58,747
Wait, what?

455
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,833
Is he buttering me up before firing me?

456
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:02,876
But I take it back.

457
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:05,795
Let's really do our best.

458
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:08,215
For a long time, if possible.

459
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:49,506
You didn't have to give me a ride.

460
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:02,560
I'll get out here.

461
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:05,814
It's raining. I'll drive you home.

462
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,774
No! I'm getting out here right now!

463
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:11,278
Okay.

464
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:16,157
Thank you.

465
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:17,826
You should take the umbrella.

466
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,786
No, it's fine! Thank you!

467
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:42,100
Damn it. The vibes were so good though.

468
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:44,644
Damn it. If it weren't for my old face…

469
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:54,029
Why did they want to meet here?

470
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,196
Is this right?

471
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:56,948
It's the right place.

472
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,075
Hello.

473
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,911
-Hello.
-Hello.

474
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:04,664
Did you call about having a cat?

475
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:06,791
-Yes. Right here.
-Great.

476
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,209
Thank you.

477
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:16,343
But I don't think
this is the cat I'm looking for.

478
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,389
You punk. Are you sure you saw her?

479
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:22,682
Did you?

480
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:25,852
You said she was a famous content creator,
but she's a hag.

481
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:28,897
I saw her put the flyers up myself.

482
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,483
You can't do anything right.
You want a beatdown?

483
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:32,442
-Hey.
-But…

484
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:34,194
What will you do if we're not paid?

485
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:37,072
I think this wound looks new.

486
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,076
Did you do this?

487
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:43,661
This is unbelievable.

488
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:45,955
Are you playing tricks
to get out of paying?

489
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:51,294
What is wrong with you?

490
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:55,632
Just leave the money and go
while we're being nice.

491
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:57,092
Okay? Hey!

492
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:58,802
You didn't get the money yet?

493
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,471
You can't get through to her. Hurry up.

494
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:04,891
What? What's the problem?

495
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:07,769
If you're old,

496
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:09,604
you should act your age.

497
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:11,398
How dare you try to rob a bunch of kids?

498
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:15,068
Hey, just shut up.
Leave the money and go.

499
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:18,238
That's not the cat I'm looking for.

500
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:20,323
Hurry and give us the money!

501
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:21,866
-You talk too much!
-Stop!

502
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,161
Who is that?

503
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:26,746
Mr. Gye.

504
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:29,416
Step back. Move.

505
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:31,334
What's going on?

506
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:32,627
We agreed to meet here.

507
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:36,631
You even brought your boyfriend.

508
00:28:36,714 --> 00:28:37,674
Incredible.

509
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:40,760
Is it okay to steal someone's cat or not?

510
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:43,430
What the hell are you saying?
No one stole it.

511
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:45,098
I don't think you get it.

512
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:48,476
If you simply stole it, that's theft.

513
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,770
A lost cat makes it theft by finding.

514
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:53,940
If you didn't feed
the stolen cat and hit it,

515
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:56,067
that adds property damage
and animal abuse.

516
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,903
The cops will decide
which one to charge you with.

517
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:02,449
I'd like to report a crime.

518
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:03,491
Wait a second!

519
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:04,701
No, wait!

520
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:05,785
Hey!

521
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:07,996
This is…

522
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:10,915
I'm in front of Manjeon Internet Café.

523
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:15,879
You son of a…

524
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:18,465
You little…

525
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,803
Wait!

526
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:25,722
You don't need to come.

527
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:27,015
Let's get out of here!

528
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:28,892
Yes, it's fine.

529
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,031
I think we should have
a proper conversation.

530
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,074
Hey, let's get out of here.

531
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,327
That hurt, didn't it?

532
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,370
Those damn jerks.

533
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,164
Go back in. I'll tuck you inside.

534
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:53,041
Let's go back in. There you go.

535
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:57,253
Did you lose your cat?

536
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:58,963
Yes.

537
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:01,049
But what brought you here?

538
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:03,092
I was looking for someone.

539
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:08,807
I feel like I always meet you
in the strangest ways.

540
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:12,018
Are you sober today?

541
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:13,102
Yes.

542
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:18,149
I wasn't able to
properly say goodbye last time.

543
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,235
I'm sorry.

544
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:23,196
You should apologize
to yourself and not me.

545
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:27,492
If something were to happen,
you'd be the one who gets hurt.

546
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:30,954
Do you have to say it like that?

547
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:33,498
What? Did I sound like a jerk again?

548
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:36,251
No.

549
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:39,671
Is it okay to send
those kids away like that?

550
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:41,881
It's fine. I identified all of them.

551
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:44,008
Still, you never know.

552
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:47,762
Are you scared they might do something?

553
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:51,140
I'm being serious,
but it seems like you're enjoying this.

554
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:53,852
Don't worry.

555
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:55,812
I'll be sure to tell them next time.

556
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:00,441
Next time?

557
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:02,861
Yes, I have to see them for something.

558
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:11,202
Goodness. You must be scared.

559
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:14,873
I think he was abandoned. He's hurt too.

560
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:16,165
Goodness, what happened?

561
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,334
Gosh, you poor thing.

562
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,088
Goodness.

563
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:24,215
Please take good care of him.

564
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,134
All right, we'll look after it.

565
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:27,135
Thank you.

566
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:28,595
Be good.

567
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:35,435
I'm sorry you didn't find your cat.

568
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:38,021
I'll just have to keep looking.

569
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:40,565
Thank you so much for earlier.

570
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:47,071
Did you know?

571
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:50,909
They say cats give back
as much as they receive.

572
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:53,411
Says who?

573
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,121
My aunt.

574
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:02,462
How cute.

575
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:06,299
Aunt Sun, do you like cats or me more?

576
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:09,844
Why would you ask that?

577
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:13,556
Because you're always buying
something yummy for cats.

578
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:18,478
But you get to eat
whatever you want all the time.

579
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:24,442
Cats can't even kiss you like this though.

580
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:26,277
Still, they know.

581
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:27,278
Know what?

582
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:30,782
Cats have special eyes.

583
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:34,869
They never forget those they love.

584
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:38,164
They give back as much as they receive.

585
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,250
Really?

586
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:43,086
Yes, really.

587
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:47,215
Then, I want to feed the cat too.

588
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:48,299
Okay.

589
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:59,769
You must've been close with your aunt.

590
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,231
I resemble her a lot.

591
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,400
People said I looked like her daughter.

592
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:10,655
I think I liked her
more than my mom back then.

593
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:12,782
What about now?

594
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:16,703
Now?

595
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,542
I like her a lot now too.

596
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:24,502
And I miss her.

597
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:37,473
SEOHAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

598
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:38,808
Seriously.

599
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:48,151
Be quiet!

600
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:50,570
You here on vacation?

601
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:53,031
The tests came back positive.

602
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:57,785
Sit up straight!

603
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:01,122
You should apologize
and pray for a suspended sentence.

604
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:02,999
How dare you chew your gum here?

605
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:06,044
-What a boomer.
-Don't use your middle finger!

606
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:09,005
Forget it. We'll charge them
with drug use and theft.

607
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:10,048
Send them to juvie.

608
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:11,632
Juvie? What did we do wrong?

609
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:14,052
He's a damn thug, not a prosecutor!

610
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:16,220
You've got a mouth on you for a student.

611
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:17,388
I'm not a student.

612
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,182
I looked into it, and they're not.

613
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:21,851
They were expelled last year
and are no long minors.

614
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:23,352
They're legal adults now.

615
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:25,646
Then, why are they wearing uniforms?
It's confusing.

616
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,357
When you wear a uniform,
it's easier to catfish

617
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:30,234
stupid women like the one from last night.

618
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:32,070
Catfish?

619
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:38,076
They're so delicious.

620
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,494
What's with her?

621
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:42,830
But is this really
a prosecutor's office?

622
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:46,334
Why is there an old lady here?

623
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:48,628
She'd be a voice phishing victim.

624
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:49,837
That was funny!

625
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:52,924
Enough with the nonsense,
and just answer the questions.

626
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:54,467
Where did you get the drug patches?

627
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:56,427
What's that? Are they snacks?

628
00:34:58,387 --> 00:35:00,264
-Shut your mouth.
-"Shut your mouth."

629
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:03,059
The thing on your arm.

630
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:05,728
That thing?

631
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:08,064
It's a contraceptive patch.

632
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:11,317
You better answer him properly!

633
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,944
Is he going to hit him?

634
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:17,782
You should answer properly
for your own good.

635
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:20,743
If we do,
then you won't call us back here?

636
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:21,828
If you answer right.

637
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:23,830
-You won't call our parents?
-It depends on you.

638
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:28,334
I'll say it only once, so listen up.

639
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:29,752
Wait a second.

640
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:38,636
In game, there's an expert sniper
who loves reggae.

641
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:40,096
I bought an item from them.

642
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:42,223
I'm a Lieutenant,
and to move up to Commander,

643
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:43,850
I have to take out snipers in Area A.

644
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:45,226
Cap the hidden enemy sniper

645
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:47,687
and push with rifles
while watching the stairs.

646
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:50,022
But the tank in front of me
threw a sick grenade.

647
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,774
She was my type, so I asked her out.

648
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:54,360
She said she knew
a great spot to grub, so I said "Cool."

649
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:57,697
But she brought rejects with her.
What am I, some kind of fool?

650
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:01,117
The food wasn't good, she was clueless,
and I couldn't fake it anymore.

651
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,743
-Right.
-So I complained.

652
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,078
And she called some loser over.

653
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,496
He's the one who brought it.

654
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,581
Well, it was…

655
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:08,291
a disaster I brought upon myself.

656
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:10,585
Take it easy. How can they understand?

657
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,170
Mr. Ju?

658
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:13,796
Was that too much?

659
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:15,715
Then, don't ask.

660
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:18,593
Did you record that?

661
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:20,553
I can't translate it. It's useless.

662
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:22,263
You didn't understand any of it?

663
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:26,726
I think he mentioned a German bar.

664
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:28,895
I see.

665
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:30,354
Excuse me.

666
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:33,482
I'll interpret it.

667
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:34,859
What?

668
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:36,861
The lady said she'll interpret.

669
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:39,155
As if she'd know.

670
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:41,574
The young man wanted to level up.

671
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:44,952
He bought an in-game item,
and while playing said game,

672
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:50,249
he met someone online to team up with
and became attracted to her.

673
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:54,170
So they decided to meet offline too.

674
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,255
Shot.

675
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:58,591
Hey, we got one.

676
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,427
Ask if we can get a discount.

677
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,387
She said we can.

678
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:10,144
General Toothpick?

679
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:11,896
Wow.

680
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:13,564
I'm Master Expert Sniper.

681
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:14,732
Hi.

682
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:19,695
Ha-yeong!

683
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:22,782
Over here!

684
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:25,076
My friends!

685
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:27,870
What?

686
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:34,210
They intentionally tried
to mooch off of him.

687
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:36,921
He became angry
at their unethical behavior

688
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:39,257
and strongly objected.

689
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:41,550
-Are you joking?
-Just you wait.

690
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:43,844
-His online teammate?
-It's me.

691
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,930
She called a deliveryman
she was close with.

692
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:48,766
A grand plan.

693
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,561
Anyways…

694
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:54,272
Jeez, I'm so busy right now.

695
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:57,817
Here, the young man learned something new.

696
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,069
-Hey.
-Sir, I'm sorry.

697
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:01,570
But it's a misunderstanding.

698
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:03,864
I'm not the one who asked to meet.

699
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:07,702
This lady asked me out first,
so that's why I came.

700
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:10,371
-Asked you out? Is that so?
-Yes.

701
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:12,415
-No, I didn't!
-Tell me the truth.

702
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:14,625
He seduced me, saying he'd buy me chicken!

703
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:16,460
I bought you chicken yesterday!

704
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:17,795
It was boneless!

705
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:20,548
You should've told me then!
How else would I know?

706
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:22,425
You've never bought me anything like this!

707
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:23,884
-Come here, you brat!
-Let go!

708
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,845
-Come here!
-Let go!

709
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:27,013
What's with you?

710
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:28,806
-You really don't know how I feel?
-No!

711
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:33,686
There was a reason
why the deliveryman came.

712
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:38,399
-It was because he was her lover.
-Incredible!

713
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:44,530
In the end,
the deliveryman gave the young man

714
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:46,657
the drug patch that's popular in clubs

715
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:48,451
to settle things.

716
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,036
The good stuff?

717
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:52,705
In conclusion,

718
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:54,665
we would need to summon and question

719
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:58,711
his online teammate and the deliveryman
who personally supplied the drug patch.

720
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:11,724
Do you see him here?

721
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:16,103
You said his name was Poppy.

722
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,855
This guy. Poppy.

723
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:20,232
-Let's track him down now.
-Yes, sir

724
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:23,903
Hey, lady. Who are you?

725
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:26,364
You're a Lieutenant?

726
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:40,294
I'm a General.

727
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:44,215
OFFICER, SENIOR OFFICER, SERGEANT,
LIEUTENANT, CAPTAIN, CHIEF, GENERAL

728
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:15,121
Goodness.

729
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:16,622
It's not even winter.

730
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:18,541
-Isn't that fur vest hot?
-Right.

731
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:19,875
Can't you hear me?

732
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:21,544
Take it off.

733
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:23,003
-Okay?
-What?

734
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:24,713
Take them off. Aren't you hot?

735
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:26,173
It's not hot at all!

736
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:27,800
It's nice and warm.

737
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:29,885
Hey.

738
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:31,053
You're sweating.

739
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:33,180
Just take it off.

740
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:34,515
I can't.

741
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:37,935
My civil servant daughter bought it
for me with her first paycheck.

742
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:42,690
Goodness. So you were wearing that
to brag about your daughter.

743
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:45,943
Want to feel it? It's expensive.

744
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:49,113
Goodness.

745
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:50,364
-It's soft.
-Isn't it?

746
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,116
It's so soft.

747
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:54,577
That's enough. It's new.
You'll wear it out.

748
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,287
Did Mi-jin buy it?

749
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:57,371
Of course.

750
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,291
-It suits me well, right?
-I guess.

751
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:02,460
It's nice. I'm jealous.

752
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:03,544
Right?

753
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:08,174
You won't freeze to death
in the freezer now. It's perfect.

754
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:15,222
Just take them off.

755
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:16,724
I'm not hot.

756
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:18,309
Looking at you is making me hot!

757
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:20,436
Either take the top off or the bottom!

758
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:23,439
If it bothers you that much,
turn on the AC then.

759
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:25,816
My goodness. Summer's already over.

760
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,234
Don't be ridiculous.

761
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:30,321
Jeez. You own this building.

762
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:33,073
And you can't even spend
a few pennies on electricity?

763
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,909
Why did you even install the AC?

764
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:37,286
Is it to block out the wind in the winter?

765
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:39,205
You must be boiling hot.

766
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:41,040
I said I'm not hot!

767
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:42,625
Unbelievable.

768
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:44,043
Goodness.

769
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:47,254
It's slowly going to get cold now.

770
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:51,467
I wonder if the prosecutor's apartment
has good heating.

771
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:53,511
What prosecutor?

772
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:55,554
The one our Mi-jin is dating.

773
00:41:56,138 --> 00:41:58,057
Your tenant.

774
00:41:58,682 --> 00:41:59,683
He's a prosecutor.

775
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,353
Prosecutor?

776
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:06,357
The same ones from TV
who question people?

777
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,358
Those prosecutors?

778
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:10,653
Yeah, those extraordinary prosecutors.

779
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:13,113
Your first time seeing one, right?

780
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:15,616
Mine too.

781
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:18,077
My goodness.

782
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,246
Wow. My goodness.

783
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:21,622
This is crazy.

784
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:25,459
Do you think I'll be sued
for leasing a haunted house?

785
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:28,671
I've always told you
to act with more of a conscience.

786
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:30,798
Serves you right.

787
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:32,341
There he goes.

788
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:36,262
Goodness.

789
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:37,805
Hello.

790
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:41,600
I have to speak with you…

791
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:45,437
about something.

792
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:46,772
What is it?

793
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:48,274
When you signed your lease,

794
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:51,527
you should've told me
that you were a prosecutor.

795
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:55,573
Do I have to tell you my profession
when signing a lease?

796
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:56,782
To be honest,

797
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:02,204
this place has a slight problem.

798
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:04,039
What problem?

799
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:08,085
Well, it's not really a problem.

800
00:43:08,168 --> 00:43:10,129
It's just a kind of…

801
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:12,756
Let's say it has a story.

802
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:16,510
Is there any place
without a story? It's fine.

803
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,971
What?

804
00:43:19,054 --> 00:43:21,849
Someone died there.

805
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:32,234
It's haunted.

806
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:39,158
It doesn't matter.
Was there anything else?

807
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:41,493
Nope.

808
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:43,078
Have a good night.

809
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:47,958
What was that?

810
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:51,003
It's like he already knew.

811
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:54,798
Does he like ghosts?

812
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:57,301
My goodness.

813
00:43:57,384 --> 00:43:58,844

LEE MI-JIN

815
00:44:13,942 --> 00:44:16,070
LIM MI-JIN

816
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:17,655
ACID ATTACKER CAUGHT BY 50-YEAR-OLD!

817
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:39,468
You said you'd cheer me up.

818
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:41,011
This is making me feel worse.

819
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:43,389
We shouldn't let free tickets go to waste.

820
00:44:50,145 --> 00:44:51,563
You've been busy job hunting

821
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:54,358
and gone through so much
that you never had a chance to relax.

822
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:57,403
Jeez, just enjoy yourself now!

823
00:44:58,028 --> 00:44:59,363
Come on.

824
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:02,491
Yeah, my best friend's the only one
who thinks about me.

825
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:04,034
What would I do without you?

826
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:04,952
Take a video of me.

827
00:45:06,995 --> 00:45:08,622
Now, follow me!

828
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:12,709
Call my name.

829
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:16,463
Good!

830
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:18,882
Turn around.

831
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:20,759
-That's good.
-Make me look tall.

832
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:22,719
Right. You look short though.

833
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:30,352
-How many times do we have to do this?
-Do it one more time.

834
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:31,937
Gosh, you're so obsessed with photos.

835
00:45:45,617 --> 00:45:47,327
Hello. Did you come here alone?

836
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:50,664
I came here with a friend.

837
00:45:50,747 --> 00:45:52,124
-Really?
-Yeah.

838
00:45:52,207 --> 00:45:53,584
Hello.

839
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:56,295
Ga-yeong, they didn't have
strawberry frappuccinos.

840
00:45:57,379 --> 00:45:58,922
You came with your mother.

841
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:00,757
-I'm her friend.
-She's not my mom.

842
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:02,926
-Have a great time.
-We hope you have fun.

843
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:03,844
Friend?

844
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:05,345
-My friend.
-Bye.

845
00:46:05,971 --> 00:46:07,431
Who were they? You know them?

846
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:09,349
I could've known them.

847
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:15,772
Cheers. Thanks, Mi-jin.

848
00:46:29,077 --> 00:46:31,413
My goodness.
Those are the clothes I put in the hamper.

849
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:35,334
It must be your good looks,
because those colors really suit you too.

850
00:46:35,417 --> 00:46:37,044
It looks better on him than you!

851
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:42,633
Here. Take this with you.

852
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:44,134
-It's fine.
-Please.

853
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:47,596
From now on,
saying "It's fine" will be prohibited.

WATER DANMUJI

855
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:17,334
What are you doing this weekend?

856
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:25,842
Do you have time to meet up?

857
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:36,436
Mi-jin, look.

858
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,813
Overhead photo. Two, three.

859
00:47:38,855 --> 00:47:39,815
Two, three.

860
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:43,402
It's so pretty! Let's take one here.

861
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:45,112
Come on.

862
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:47,698
This is really the last one.
Just one more.

863
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:49,575
-I swear.
-We've been at it for hours.

864
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:50,826
We keep taking videos.

865
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:51,910
Just help me out a bit!

866
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:53,245
I finally got a sponsor.

867
00:47:53,328 --> 00:47:55,080
You brought me here for this, didn't you?

868
00:47:55,163 --> 00:47:56,039
Of course not!

869
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:58,041
This trip is for both work and pleasure.

870
00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:59,918
Make money and play for free.

871
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:01,211
It's the best of two worlds.

872
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:03,088
Kill two birds with one stone!

873
00:48:03,171 --> 00:48:04,256
-So nice!
-Ridiculous.

874
00:48:04,339 --> 00:48:06,008
That stone's going to kill me.

875
00:48:06,091 --> 00:48:08,302
Let's be honest.

876
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:10,971
-You can't even have fun.
-Hey.

877
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:13,557
Once the sun goes down and you come back,

878
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,559
that's when we were going to have fun!

879
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:17,311
I'm exhausted now.

880
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:19,563
When is the sun going to set?

881
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:20,480
SEOHAN SUNSET TIME

882
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:21,648
What do we do?

883
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:23,191
Go before you change.

884
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:24,776
-Okay!
-Here's the key!

885
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:26,612
Bye!

886
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:27,946
I'll be waiting here.

887
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:32,743
A video this time.

888
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:34,411
Hey, everyone!

889
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:40,375
Where did she go?

890
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:43,170
Damn it. She could've lost my phone.

891
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:53,555
What?

892
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:55,474
Hello, are you here alone?

893
00:48:55,557 --> 00:48:56,975
Would you like to hang out?

894
00:48:57,059 --> 00:48:58,894
No, I have to look for my friend.

895
00:48:59,561 --> 00:49:02,272
That's great. There are two of us too.

896
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:03,357
How about a drink?

897
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:04,983
She has company.

898
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:10,906
Have a great time.

899
00:49:13,241 --> 00:49:14,701
What are you doing here?

900
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:16,745
Exactly. Why tell me to come here?

901
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:19,956
I had my doubts,
but it really is a water park.

902
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,124
-I did?
-Yes.

903
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:23,543
You texted me to come here.
You sent a map too.

904
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:27,381
I told the prosecutor to come.

905
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:29,216
It's a tree!

906
00:49:32,177 --> 00:49:33,720
Jeez, she forgot her phone.

907
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,600
Do you have time to meet up?

908
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:46,608
Sure! Let's meet now!

909
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:49,069
I'll send you the address. Please hurry!

910
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:51,113
The game's been set, so enjoy the match.

911
00:49:51,196 --> 00:49:52,197
That crazy…

912
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:55,158
Are you going to keep swimming?

913
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:00,455
Probably not, right?

914
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:16,763
Jeez, summer's over now.
Why are there still so many bugs?

915
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:19,266
-They're not on me.
-Yes, they are. Look closely.

916
00:50:20,225 --> 00:50:22,144
But why did you want to see me?

917
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:23,729
Here.

918
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:28,567
What is this?
Did you pick this up on your way here?

919
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:32,612
I see.

920
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,531
Tell your mother I enjoyed them.

921
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,659
You called me
on a weekend night for this?

922
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:39,244
And all the way out here?

923
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:43,790
I was going to come by your house.
But it's nice to get some air too.

924
00:50:44,624 --> 00:50:46,585
Should I just kill Ga-yeong?

925
00:50:47,252 --> 00:50:48,128
By the way,

926
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:51,965
you really don't remember that night?

927
00:50:52,048 --> 00:50:54,217
-It'd be awful if I remembered.
-What?

928
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:59,931
So what I'm saying is
I don't remember anything at all.

929
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:01,099
Yeah.

930
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:03,810
That's what I mean.

931
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:05,729
I swear.

932
00:51:28,835 --> 00:51:31,671
Gye Ji-ung, Gye Ji-ung

933
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:34,674
Gye Ji-ung

934
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:38,220
The world hasn't changed

935
00:51:38,303 --> 00:51:41,723
Time is passing by

936
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:44,935
But I'm the only one

937
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:49,189
Who has changed

938
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:52,901
Scattered by the wind

939
00:51:52,984 --> 00:51:56,905
My wishes made in vain

940
00:51:56,988 --> 00:51:59,533
Frustratingly

941
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:06,581
Disappear

942
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:08,542
Is it a crime to be old?

943
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:10,252
You think you won't grow old?

944
00:52:10,335 --> 00:52:13,296
You'll be an old man soon
and a grandpa in an instant!

945
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:18,635
Why look down on age? Why?

946
00:52:18,718 --> 00:52:22,722
Don't you know the saying,
"Young at heart"?

947
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:24,975
The old lady you work with.

948
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:28,144
If you don't want to work with her,
just tell her to leave.

949
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:29,896
Why didn't you fire her?

950
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,314
Because you pitied her?

951
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:32,983
Or did you just totally ignore her?

952
00:52:33,066 --> 00:52:34,025
Why won't you answer?

953
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:37,028
Damn it.

954
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:49,583
Hello?

955
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:52,586
Hello?

956
00:52:54,629 --> 00:52:55,463
Mi-jin.

957
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:05,265
Because she was like me.

958
00:53:07,642 --> 00:53:09,519
She looked like she had
nowhere else to go.

959
00:54:02,697 --> 00:54:06,368
INVESTIGATOR JU BYEONG-DEOK

960
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:08,078
Hello, Mr. Ju.

961
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:10,372
He's been off-grid for a few days now.

962
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:14,417
He caught wind of the students
being investigated and ran.

963
00:54:16,294 --> 00:54:18,505
If he went into hiding,
let's lure him out.

964
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:19,673
How?

965
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:23,468
His girlfriend is active online,
so let's use that.

966
00:54:24,302 --> 00:54:26,179
Do you think that's possible?

967
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:32,852
-You need me?
-Yes.

968
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:35,188
We need your exceptional skills.

969
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:39,401
You can ask me anything.

970
00:54:39,484 --> 00:54:40,610
It's about video games.

971
00:54:41,903 --> 00:54:42,821
-Video games?
-Yes.

972
00:54:42,904 --> 00:54:44,322
Just find the woman who sold

973
00:54:44,406 --> 00:54:46,741
the in-game item
to that young man we questioned.

974
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:48,868
In other words, log on and keep watch.

975
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:50,245
All you have to do is

976
00:54:50,328 --> 00:54:53,081
try to make a deal,
and we'll do the rest.

977
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:54,582
A deal for an in-game item?

978
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:57,627
That's right.
She's even stolen from students.

979
00:54:57,711 --> 00:54:59,421
We'll get her quick if we do it right.

980
00:54:59,504 --> 00:55:01,673
She's likely pressed for money
while in hiding too.

981
00:55:01,756 --> 00:55:04,759
Right. At that level,
she's probably addicted.

982
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:07,137
-She'd play every day.
-But can you do it?

983
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:10,473
Of course. I'll find her. Sure.

984
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:17,480
Once you find her and approach her,

985
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:19,107
induce an offline meeting.

986
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:22,694
Whether it's for an in-game item
or friendship, do whatever you can.

987
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:24,779
What will happen after that?

988
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:27,866
We'll follow her
and discover where she's hiding.

989
00:55:27,949 --> 00:55:30,952
Or we'll provoke her
to call her boyfriend like that kid did.

990
00:55:39,252 --> 00:55:42,213
This is driving me crazy.
I can't even play.

991
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:46,676
Skins and items are for sale. Contact me!

992
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:47,677
What?

993
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:50,096
Hell yeah.

994
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:51,681
She's here!

995
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:53,558
I want to buy both.

996
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:54,642
Let's eat some chicken.

997
00:55:55,393 --> 00:55:57,729
Deal. No discounts. Is that okay?

998
00:55:58,563 --> 00:56:01,149
-Nice! Can I get a small discount?
-Let me think.

999
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:03,109
I'll buy you chicken.

1000
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:06,237
Deal.

1001
00:56:08,323 --> 00:56:10,366
We agreed to meet on Thursday at 4 p.m.!

1002
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:11,367
Really?

1003
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:12,452
Yes.

1004
00:56:18,124 --> 00:56:18,958
-Ga-yeong!
-What?

1005
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:21,711
-I'm in charge of an investigation!
-What?

1006
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:24,506
-Did something happen?
-Where do I start?

1007
00:56:24,589 --> 00:56:25,673
-What is it?
-Hey.

1008
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:27,383
-I need some makeup.
-Makeup?

1009
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:29,177
Make me look like an intellectual.

1010
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:30,261
-Okay.
-You know.

1011
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:31,805
-Like Scully!
-I don't know.

1012
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:32,931
Scully wasn't old.

1013
00:56:33,014 --> 00:56:35,016
I need some thick eyeliner.

1014
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:37,310
Thick? Okay.

1015
00:56:37,393 --> 00:56:39,395
I'll just draw on thick eyeliner then.

1016
00:56:40,313 --> 00:56:41,314
Yeah.

1017
00:56:41,397 --> 00:56:42,440
Shut your eyes.

1018
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:47,612
-Am I late?
-How thick does it have to be?

1019
00:56:47,695 --> 00:56:48,696
Wait.

1020
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:52,325
You scared me! Jeez, come on!

1021
00:56:52,408 --> 00:56:53,910
-Jeez.
-What do I do?

1022
00:56:53,993 --> 00:56:56,454
I can't come at 4 p.m.
I'll see you at 8 p.m.

1023
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:58,623
The sun's gone by then. What will you do?

1024
00:56:58,706 --> 00:56:59,707
I'm screwed.

1025
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:02,544
No, I have to fix this.

1026
00:57:02,627 --> 00:57:04,754
How? How will you fix this?

1027
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:06,589
I have to or the investigation's ruined.

1028
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:08,466
But how?

1029
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:10,385
What are you going to do?

1030
00:57:10,468 --> 00:57:11,970
Can you come any sooner?

1031
00:57:12,053 --> 00:57:14,222
In return, I'll buy you
two whole chickens.

1032
00:57:15,181 --> 00:57:17,308
I'm full, so two is too much.

1033
00:57:18,351 --> 00:57:19,477
Muscle building.

1034
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:21,855
-Yeah.
-Good, right? Okay, for bulking up.

1035
00:57:21,938 --> 00:57:24,315
I'm exercising to build muscle.
I can't meet at night.

1036
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:26,860
You must have a nice body.

1037
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:29,696
"You must have a nice body."

1038
00:57:30,905 --> 00:57:32,824
Okay, I'll see you at 6 p.m.

1039
00:57:32,907 --> 00:57:34,325
Hey, when's sunset today?

1040
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:35,535
Sunset? Hold on.

1041
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:38,872
It's at 7 p.m.

1042
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:40,415
-That's a bit risky.
-Yeah.

1043
00:57:40,498 --> 00:57:41,916
What if you end up caught?

1044
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:46,004
I'll see you at 6 p.m. then.

1045
00:57:46,087 --> 00:57:47,255
Is that okay?

1046
00:57:47,922 --> 00:57:48,798
-Let's try.
-Try?

1047
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:50,049
-Yeah.
-Okay, let's try!

1048
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:51,134
Let's give it a try.

1049
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:53,720
I'M EXERCISING TO BUILD MUSCLE

1050
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:55,180
"Build muscle"?

1051
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:57,348
How much muscle?

1052
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:00,768
Jeez. I'll go then.

1053
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:04,022
Substance is what's important.

1054
00:58:05,064 --> 00:58:06,065
I'll watch the back.

1055
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:07,400
Should I watch the front?

1056
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:10,069
Another chest pain would be dangerous.
Don't come out.

1057
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:11,863
I can't be the only one to sit out.

1058
00:58:11,946 --> 00:58:13,198
We should do it together.

1059
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:15,783
Your job was up to this point.
It's fine. You did great.

1060
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:25,084
True. It'd be bad if the sun sets
and my face changes.

1061
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:26,688
She's here.

1062
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:29,566
SHE'S HERE!

1063
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:39,617
This is her, right?

1064
01:00:22,368 --> 01:00:23,953
Semi-basement King?

1065
01:00:24,662 --> 01:00:26,080
Sniper Master?

1066
01:00:27,832 --> 01:00:30,418
You really have built up a lot of muscle.

1067
01:00:44,265 --> 01:00:45,600
What in the world?

1068
01:00:45,683 --> 01:00:47,393
What? Is she looking at us?

1069
01:00:54,233 --> 01:00:55,068
Please eat.

1070
01:00:55,777 --> 01:00:59,280
-I'm usually a picky eater.
-I see.

1071
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:01,199
It's so hot.

1072
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:03,284
Are you hot?

1073
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:09,374
Is it the heat?

1074
01:01:09,457 --> 01:01:10,917
I want a drink.

1075
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,211
Drinks? This early?

1076
01:01:13,294 --> 01:01:15,672
Drinking's better
when the sun's still out.

1077
01:01:16,214 --> 01:01:18,424
All you do is work out,
so you must not know.

1078
01:01:19,717 --> 01:01:21,636
-Ma'am! Two beers, please!
-All right.

1079
01:01:21,719 --> 01:01:22,595
Wait, I…

1080
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:25,640
I don't…

1081
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:29,477
What's going on?

1082
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,411
-Cheers!
-I drove here.

1083
01:01:46,494 --> 01:01:47,328
I'm sorry.

1084
01:01:49,664 --> 01:01:52,500
You're making me lose my appetite.
I even gave you a discount.

1085
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:01,134
Cheers.

1086
01:02:02,301 --> 01:02:06,305
Gosh, I told you I was upset,
and you gave in right away.

1087
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:09,142
-Goodness.
-My gosh!

1088
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:11,144
Damn it.

1089
01:02:15,648 --> 01:02:16,816
Seriously!

1090
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:18,818
She has a boyfriend. What's her deal?

1091
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:23,823
You're so funny!

1092
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:27,827
What's that smell?

1093
01:02:29,912 --> 01:02:31,038
You smell so nice.

1094
01:02:31,122 --> 01:02:32,582
That's enough!

1095
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:36,544
I'm sorry.

1096
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:39,130
I have to go to the bathroom.

1097
01:02:41,716 --> 01:02:43,092
Come back quickly!

1098
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:54,645
Hey, babe.

1099
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:56,689
I went out to sell stuff.

1100
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:58,483
Damn, I can't hear her.

1101
01:02:58,566 --> 01:03:00,485
Sorry, I'm going to be late.

1102
01:03:00,568 --> 01:03:03,070
I'll buy you some chicken on my way back.

1103
01:03:03,154 --> 01:03:07,408
I love you! Kisses.

1104
01:03:10,077 --> 01:03:11,662
Okay.

1105
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:13,289

SEND

1106
01:03:25,927 --> 01:03:26,761
Hey.

1107
01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:32,642
What's that?

1108
01:03:32,725 --> 01:03:33,559
She's…

1109
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:37,230
Is she putting in drugs?

1110
01:03:37,313 --> 01:03:38,356
That crazy…

1111
01:03:38,439 --> 01:03:39,565
Seriously!

1112
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:44,237
That damn lunatic.

1113
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:45,321
Hold on.

1114
01:03:46,614 --> 01:03:47,448
Damn it!

1115
01:03:47,532 --> 01:03:48,616
Welcome back.

1116
01:03:52,912 --> 01:03:53,955
This won't do.

1117
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:58,376
OFFICE ASSISTANT LIM SUN

1118
01:04:00,419 --> 01:04:02,338
Keep your phone off until the evening.

1119
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:04,674
What?

1120
01:04:06,634 --> 01:04:07,844
This is driving me nuts!

1121
01:04:07,927 --> 01:04:10,221
Okay. Here's your beer.

1122
01:04:13,057 --> 01:04:14,058
What time is it?

1123
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:30,867
Damn it!

1124
01:04:31,993 --> 01:04:33,578
Damn it. For crying out loud.

1125
01:04:34,161 --> 01:04:36,539
What are you doing?

1126
01:04:36,622 --> 01:04:38,499
Why aren't you drinking?

1127
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:40,001
-Excuse me. Who are you?
-Sorry.

1128
01:04:40,084 --> 01:04:41,502
-Wait.
-I don't feel well.

1129
01:04:41,586 --> 01:04:43,004
Who are you?

1130
01:04:43,087 --> 01:04:44,839
Just one drink, okay?

1131
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:51,888
-Hurry and drink!
-Okay.

1132
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:52,805
Cheers.

1133
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:55,641
Don't drink it. I saw it.

1134
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:56,684
Cheers.

1135
01:04:57,268 --> 01:04:58,895
-Okay.
-Does your neck hurt?

1136
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:00,605
No, I'm fine.

1137
01:05:00,688 --> 01:05:01,564
Cheers.

1138
01:05:04,358 --> 01:05:06,319
-What do you keep looking at?
-No, wait…

1139
01:05:06,861 --> 01:05:08,029
Cheers.

1140
01:05:09,363 --> 01:05:11,824
It's bottoms up. You have to finish it.

1141
01:05:12,491 --> 01:05:13,409
I saw her.

1142
01:05:13,492 --> 01:05:14,410
She did this.

1143
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:16,662
Dizzy. No, don't.

1144
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:18,289
You'll be like this.

1145
01:05:18,372 --> 01:05:20,499
No.

1146
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:22,126
No!

1147
01:06:03,668 --> 01:06:06,587
MISS NIGHT AND DAY

1148
01:06:07,254 --> 01:06:08,839
-What's going on with you two?
-He's my boyfriend!

1149
01:06:08,923 --> 01:06:11,717
-Starting today, he's mine!
-Is she your girlfriend? Or a fling?

1150
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:13,678
I'll wait until you can tell me.

1151
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:18,933
So the person who saved you, Lim Sun?
There aren't any records of her.

1152
01:06:19,016 --> 01:06:20,935
You know this is really suspicious, right?

1153
01:06:21,018 --> 01:06:22,561
When Aunt Sun disappeared…

1154
01:06:23,562 --> 01:06:25,940
Are you saying
it's my fault she disappeared?

1155
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:27,733
Director Baek Cheol-gyu.

1156
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:29,527
We need to find out.

1157
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:33,990
What's going on?

1158
01:06:34,073 --> 01:06:35,074
Is something wrong?

1159
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:44,000
