00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:45,962
MISS NIGHT AND DAY

2
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,665
GOOD LUCK ON YOUR EXAMS

EXAM SITE

5
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:43,937
Hey, kid.

6
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:47,440
-You'll get the highest score on the exam.
-Me?

7
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,609
But when it comes to getting a job…

8
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:50,985
Come here for a second.

9
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,198
It can't be done
with just grit or perseverance.

10
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,659
Isn't it time you realized that by now?

11
00:01:57,742 --> 00:01:58,785
Who are you?

12
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:02,914
You could say I'm like a miracle worker
that makes the impossible possible.

13
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:05,875
I don't believe in luck or miracles.

14
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:08,878
The world might deceive you,

15
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:12,507
but a miraculous business card
could change your life.

16
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:30,358
I pray to the heavens.

17
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:35,113
Please let our Mi-jin pass
her civil service exam.

18
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:38,783
She's been studying her tail off
for eight straight years,

19
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:41,202
and she's failed each time!

20
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:44,789
There's no misfortune
as disastrous as this.

21
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:46,791
If she fails again this time,

22
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,502
she's going to keep studying for it

23
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,504
all the way until she's forty

24
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:52,881
since she's so stubborn!

25
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:57,135
Please help our family
this one time. I beg of you.

26
00:02:57,927 --> 00:02:59,679
My goodness! Oh, no!

27
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,098
That wretched stray cat!

28
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:04,434
My gosh! Oh, no! What am I going to do?

29
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:05,351
Goodness.

30
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:07,937
I swear…

31
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,817
-Next, Jeong Min-su.
-Yes.

32
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:13,818
And Lee Mi-jin.

33
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:14,736
-Yes!
-Yes!

34
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,195
-Lee Mi-jin?
-Yes?

35
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,196
-Yes?
-Come in.

36
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:20,033
Lee Mi-jin?

37
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:20,950
Yes.

38
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,285
Please go ahead.

39
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,662
I see you're both named Lee Mi-jin.

40
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,080
Lee Mi-jin One, in her twenties.

41
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,833
Lee Mi-jin Two, in her thirties.
Let's do it this way.

42
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,543
I'm also in my twenties though.

43
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,546
If you're 28, you're in your thirties.

44
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,089
Most apply in their twenties.

45
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:37,175
Those in their thirties
or forties will be tough.

46
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:40,220
I'm armed with maturity
and unlimited energy!

47
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:43,723
I ranked the highest
on personality and physical tests.

48
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:46,976
I'm the best in terms
of my strong will and effort as well!

49
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:47,977
Just a moment.

50
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,604
-Lee Mi-jin One.
-Just sit.

51
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:52,148
My MBTI is ENFP.

52
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,776
My strength is that I'm bright
like a puppy.

53
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:57,195
I know I can do well!

54
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:59,030
-I can do it!
-I can do it!

55
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,630
WE REGRET TO INFORM YOU
THAT YOU WERE NOT SELECTED

56
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:20,093
What am I going to tell my mom this time?

57
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:42,824
I'm home.

58
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:44,284
Mi-jin!

59
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,576
-Yeah?
-Come here.

60
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:48,913
Why didn't you tell me?

61
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:49,831
Are you upset?

62
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:51,082
Of course, I am!

63
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:53,167
All right, dear. That's enough.

64
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:54,711
This calls for a celebration.

65
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:58,965
I called the environmental department.

66
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:01,801
You should've told us
that you got the job!

67
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:03,428
Why didn't you say anything?

68
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,639
-I got the job? Me?
-Yeah!

69
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:09,267
I see you're both named Lee Mi-jin.

70
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,810
Lee Mi-jin One, in her twenties.

71
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:13,438
Lee Mi-jin Two, in her thirties.
Let's proceed this way.

72
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:17,734
Mom, it's not what you think…

73
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,360
I know I'm saying this in hindsight,

74
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,070
but during that whole time

75
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:24,991
while you were locked in your room
studying for civil service exams,

76
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:27,618
it felt like rocks in my mind
weighing me down,

77
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:31,205
and I couldn't comfortably eat anything
for even a day. Did you know?

78
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,374
What's the point of telling her that now?

79
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,502
Because she got the job!
Imagine if she'd failed again!

80
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:39,672
Do you really think I could say
what I just said to her?

81
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,007
Anyway…

82
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:46,888
Goodness, it's such a relief. I mean it.

83
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:48,264
Isn't it?

84
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:50,725
I was embarrassed
to show my face around town.

85
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:53,019
Anyway, great job. Okay?

86
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:54,729
My baby.

87
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:56,647
At least you finally got a job.

88
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,359
I can die in peace now.

89
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,280
I'm so happy!

90
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,042
Hi, dear!

91
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,543
It's me.

92
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:20,254
You're the one who told me

93
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:23,007
to call you first
when my daughter got a job.

94
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:27,178
Yeah! She got the job.

95
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,555
What? Seven years.

96
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,808
After failing interviews for seven years,

97
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,476
she made it in her eighth year!

98
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,561
Don't say all of that!

99
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,271
What? Right.

100
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,315
Are you okay?

101
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:25,027
Thank you.

102
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,779
I think you hit your forehead…

103
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:34,370
I thought about it a lot
before coming here.

104
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:38,458
Things like this should be settled easily
so everything can be done at once.

105
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,376
This really isn't a scam, right?

106
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,044
What do you take me for?

107
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:46,757
Look into my eyes.

108
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,428
Do I look like a fraud
who'll bleed someone dry?

109
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:54,515
Jeez, why are you dressed
like a court lady? I feel uncomfortable.

110
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,312
I had a gig as an extra.
There was a lady who was a no-show.

111
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:00,563
I didn't have time to change.

112
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,442
But if it were that easy
to get a government job,

113
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:07,195
the eight years I spent studying
would feel like a waste.

114
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:11,574
I don't give this chance to just anyone.

115
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,910
Just one spot opened up
and I barely got it

116
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,828
after begging for it.

117
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:20,666
To be honest, I had no idea there was
a recommendation system in place.

118
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,001
Give me the documents first.

119
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:26,339
I brought all of the documents
you asked me to prepare.

120
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:34,847
These days, everyone's hired
through nepotism.

121
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,225
That's why our poor
and innocent job seekers

122
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:40,061
keep failing their interviews
after all their hard work.

123
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:45,775
But… your fees seem rather high.

124
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,945
Couldn't you give me a small discount?

125
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,573
A big discount is great,
but a small one's okay too.

126
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,618
Are you trying to haggle
like we're at a marketplace?

127
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:56,577
Come on.

128
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:59,914
Just spend your life job seeking
until you're old and tired then.

129
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:01,541
No.

130
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,376
I'll pay it.

131
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:05,878
It's expensive. Don't touch.

132
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,967
Be ready. I hit the jackpot today.

133
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,970
I'll buy you something good.
Tell me what you want to eat.

134
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,890
Goodness, I am so sorry.

135
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:21,394
Excuse me, but may I use
your phone to make a call?

136
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:23,396
I have to meet someone,
but I lost my phone.

137
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,064
I'd really appreciate it.

138
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:26,315
Make it quick then.

139
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,733
Okay, thank you.

140
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,032
Hey, it's me.

141
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:36,993
Yeah, it's not my number.

142
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,745
Some idiot stole my phone.

143
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,290
No, it's fine.

144
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,334
Track this phone's location and details.

145
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,839
Here you go. Thank you.

146
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:54,218
Goodness.
Some idiot must've stolen your phone.

147
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,470
I know. The world's full of crooks.

148
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:59,056
The world's a terrible place these days.

149
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,308
You have to be careful.

150
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:04,687
Did you make the deposit?

151
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:06,856
My limit's only five million won.

152
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,983
Can I send you the rest tomorrow?

153
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:11,569
I can't do business with you
if you keep this up.

154
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:13,696
I might not be able to continue.

155
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,573
I'll go and get it
from the bank right now.

156
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:18,451
That's a burner phone.
I tracked its location just in case.

157
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:20,328
Go quickly.

158
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,207
Thank you for earlier. Here you go.

159
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,044
You didn't have to.

160
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:28,961
Thank you.

161
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,130
That's hot!

162
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:32,214
Wait, it's not hot.

163
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,674
Damn it.

164
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,426
-Sorry.
-My wallet can't get wet.

165
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:36,719
-Give it here.
-Damn it!

166
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,262
-Use these napkins.
-Jeez.

167
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:39,930
Yeah, can you run a background check?

168
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:41,807
The name's "Choi Geun-ju."

169
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,018
Resident registration number is 891017.

170
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:45,853
-And 112…
-Are you insane?

171
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:48,939
Damn it!

172
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,362
What's going on?

173
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:56,197
Can't you tell? He's a scammer.

174
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:03,871
Hey! You bastard!

175
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,252
Hey, you jerk!

176
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:19,595
Who the hell are you?

177
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:47,039
Damn, he was on me like a leech!
He was so tall though.

178
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:55,548
Hey, you scammer!

179
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:57,800
There you are, you fraud! Hey!

180
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,176
Give back my money! Hey!

181
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,637
-I'm sorry!
-Hey, wait…

182
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:03,347
Hey!

183
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:05,808
Stop right there!

184
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,184
Stop, you jerk!

185
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,274
Are you okay?

186
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,359
It's dangerous, so don't follow.

187
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,446
What in the world?

188
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:21,907
Mr. Gye?

189
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,375
Let go of me!

190
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:35,004
You could find a decent job if you want,
but you leech off others instead?

191
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,297
Who are you? Are you a cop?

192
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,340
I'm the cop, punk!

193
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,426
Who is this punk?

194
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,845
He scams job seekers.

195
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,263
I caught him at the scene,

196
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:45,598
you can take him in now.

197
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:48,767
Wow, you caught him within ten minutes?

198
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,144
Get up, punk.

199
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:54,857
Hey! You bastard!

200
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,110
Hey!

201
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,612
-Give me my money!
-What is this?

202
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:00,863
-Give it!
-What are you doing?

203
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:03,324
Give me back my money!

204
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:05,159
That's enough. You can't do this.

205
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:06,744
-My money!
-You can't do this!

206
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,164
You rotten punk.

207
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:12,416
You had nothing better to do
than steal pennies?

208
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,667
Don't hit me!

209
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:22,801
I can't go home like this.

210
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:27,056
That money was from my mom's shop.

211
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,726
Mom…

212
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:34,980
I'll escort her to the station.

213
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,900
She could get emotional again
while riding with the perpetrator.

214
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:40,611
He's the type who'd say
both parties were at fault.

215
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:42,696
Okay. We have to question the victim.

216
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,241
-Please do it as quickly as you can.
-Okay.

217
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:17,273
Excuse me, ma'am?

218
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:19,733
I was looking for you.

219
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,861
Thank you for earlier.

220
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:24,780
Put these on first.

221
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,409
No, it's fine. I'm okay.

222
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:30,286
The witness interview takes a long time.

223
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,872
The station's floor is cold. Put them on.

224
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,290
Thank you.

225
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,749
Also, we'll take my car.

226
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,585
No, I can take the bus.

227
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,503
Your bag and things are in my car.

228
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:40,671
Put those shoes on first.

229
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,833
-Put your seatbelt on.
-Okay.

230
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,548
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm fine.

231
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:27,176
-I'm sorry.
-No, that's okay.

232
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:32,431
Why is this man so friendly?

233
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,184
Is he trying to scam me too?

234
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:37,186
Thank you for the ride.

235
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,689
I don't normally meddle
in other people's business, but…

236
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:42,483
But?

237
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:44,777
I guess I felt a sense of responsibility.

238
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,904
What responsibility?

239
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:49,156
I'm just saying
there's no need to thank me.

240
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,033
Okay.

241
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:54,828
But how did you meet that fraud?

242
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,122
Well…

243
00:15:58,374 --> 00:15:59,917
It's kind of embarrassing to say.

244
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:10,427
I'm sorry,
but this is all I have right now.

245
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:14,473
-It's fine.
-Thank you for everything.

246
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:15,599
It's fine--

247
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:18,727
It's really okay…

248
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:25,192
She seems so normal.
How did she fall victim to that fraud?

249
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,334
Wow, you're pretty brave.

250
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,586
You came up with a scam
at civil service exams?

251
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,255
If you want to dig a well,

252
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,132
you have to go somewhere
with thirsty people

253
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:51,468
to increase your chances of success,
and that's just how it works.

254
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,137
-You punk.
-Sir, that's illegal.

255
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,097
You should shove his face into that bowl.

256
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,724
This is a police station, you punk.

257
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:58,517
-Goodness.
-Detective?

258
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,687
But when do you think
I can get my money back?

259
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,565
Well, it was deposited
into a voice phishing account.

260
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:06,108
You can't get it right away.

261
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,192
What?

262
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:09,570
No.

263
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:12,364
I need that money now.

264
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:13,615
Wait…

265
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,744
Did you bring emergency funds
to give to the scammer?

266
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:17,828
Well…

267
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:21,665
-That bastard…
-Wait!

268
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,459
-Give me my money!
-What are you doing?

269
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,294
-Now, now.
-Why are you eating?

270
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,796
Calm down, okay?

271
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:30,174
But he…

272
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:34,678
He said if I paid the fee,

273
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:36,847
I'd get the job.

274
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,974
-Okay.
-I could get a loan for civil servants.

275
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,351
And he said I could
get my money back right away.

276
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,145
So?

277
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:48,609
I gave him my bankbook too.

278
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:49,693
What?

279
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,654
I gave him my bankbook.

280
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,364
-You gave him your bankbook?
-Goodness!

281
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,241
-Good grief, ma'am!
-My gosh!

282
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:57,743
I'm not that old!

283
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,955
Sir, I'll look into his fake accounts too.

284
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:02,873
All right.

285
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:06,001
Did I do something wrong again?

286
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,837
If this ends up being connected
to a phishing case,

287
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:12,841
the victim can become
the perpetrator in a heartbeat!

288
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,676
But I'm the victim.

289
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,928
I know that!

290
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,357
Goodness.

291
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:51,547
What is this?

292
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,756
SELF-INTRODUCTION

293
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,715
RÉSUMÉ

294
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:56,969
Put your seatbelt on.

295
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:10,274
NAME: LEE MI-JIN
RESIDENT REGISTRATION NUMBER: 960316

296
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:11,567
She was born in 1996?

297
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:30,210
There are so many companies in the world.

298
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:37,426
But how come there's no place
to work for me?

299
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:48,770
Hello?

300
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,689
-Is this Lee Mi-jin?
-Yes.

301
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:52,774
This is
Seoul District Prosecutors' Office.

302
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:56,653
Your personal information has been leaked.
Check the balance of your bank account--

303
00:19:56,737 --> 00:20:00,490
Excuse me. I'm in no position
to take a call like this right now.

304
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:02,576
Then, if you send
your public key certificate--

305
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:03,660
Listen,

306
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:07,247
I only have 1,500 won
in my account, so it's fine.

307
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,541
Don't be like that.
Before the funds are withdrawn--

308
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,252
You don't seem to get it
since I'm saying it nicely.

309
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:16,798
I'm in no mood for this kind of call,
you damn fraud!

310
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,342
You think I'm stupid?

311
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:21,428
-Do I look stupid to you?
-Do you know who I am?

312
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:22,930
Who are you?

313
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:24,932
I'm Jang Chen!

314
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,184
You can't even earn a living, you wretch!

315
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:29,061
-Speak for yourself!
-What did you say?

316
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:31,313
-Hey--
-Is he out of his mind?

317
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:45,619
Is it you again? The prosecutor?

318
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,914
-How did you know?
-I warned you.

319
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:50,874
I said I'm in no mood for it today.

320
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:54,002
I understand you're upset
because of the scammer.

321
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,921
-But why the rude words…
-You understand?

322
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:59,424
If you understand,
then how did you get my number?

323
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:02,386
It seems your personal information

324
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:04,304
accidentally fell into my hands.

325
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:05,764
"Accidentally"?

326
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:08,558
Hey, you crazy psycho!
You're worse than a rabid dog!

327
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,143
I can't believe what you're saying.

328
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:14,064
Who do you think you are
to call me back like this?

329
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:16,733
Are you insane? You said you were
Jang Chen earlier, right?

330
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:19,194
If you're Jang Chen,
I'm my neighborhood's Jang Yi-soo!

331
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,113
If you call me one more time,

332
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:24,241
I'm going to rip your lips off
and hang them off the moon!

333
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:27,411
So you better brace yourself
if you're going to call me again!

334
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:28,495
You bastard!

335
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,377
BLOCK

336
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,880
The next stop is Saeyeoul Apartments.

337
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,717
-I'm sorry.
-The next stop is Saeyeoul Elementary.

338
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,719
My stomach suddenly hurts.

339
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:49,057
The person you are trying to call
is unavailable…

340
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:53,437
Wow.

341
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:00,902
NAME: LEE MI-JIN

342
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:13,790
What do I do?

343
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:26,845
I'm a mess.

344
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:03,173
SOUNDS OF CALMING RAIN AT DAWN

345
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:16,019
Daeho-ri in Seohan City…

346
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:19,189
It's a very strange place.

347
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:22,067
Twenty years ago,

348
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,860
a lot of women went missing.

349
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:29,658
There was a witness connected
to the disappearances, but they died.

350
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:33,703
Things settled down after that.

351
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:38,125
But it's hard to investigate
when an adult goes missing.

352
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:42,838
Where do you think

353
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,216
all of those missing people went?

354
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:08,780
It's a cat.

355
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,491
Hi.

356
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:14,286
Why aren't you running away?

357
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:18,165
It's really not running away.

358
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,461
Are you hungry?

359
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:27,883
Wait.

360
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:33,889
I got this from my gig today.

361
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,017
I think you can drink this.

362
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:38,810
Here, drink it.

363
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:44,482
You don't have anywhere to go either?

364
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:49,404
Same here.

365
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:52,949
What's even sadder is

366
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,786
no one's looking for me.

367
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:01,917
Why aren't you drinking?

368
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,761
You look just like this cat I know.

369
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,138
Instead of a broke job seeker like me,

370
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:17,349
make sure you find a rich owner

371
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:20,727
who gets paid well
and feeds you nice organic food.

372
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:21,728
Got it?

373
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:24,147
Here, drink this.

374
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:25,857
Good.

375
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,822
I can't pet you
since I have milk in my hand.

376
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:36,493
Fine dust is in full swing

377
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:39,704
in the central region, including Seoul.

378
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:42,832
The government has issued
a fine dust warning across the nation.

379
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:44,584
I'm home.

380
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:46,628
Hey. Welcome home, Mi-jin!

381
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,630
It will decrease.

382
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:50,465
But instead of better air quality…

383
00:25:50,548 --> 00:25:52,092
Why are you dressed like that?

384
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:54,594
Why are you wearing that?

385
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:55,971
I told you I had a gig.

386
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:01,559
A maiden ghost yesterday
and a middle-aged court lady today.

387
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:03,728
It's not like you get paid
that much though.

388
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:06,690
Is that why you were too busy
to answer your phone today?

389
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:07,816
Did you call?

390
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:10,568
My phone's out of battery.

391
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:12,404
I almost forgot. Mi-jin.

392
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:15,031
Did you make the payment
for the goods the other day?

393
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:16,825
Did you pay the wrong person?

394
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:19,911
I made the payment.

395
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:21,121
Right?

396
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:24,666
Jeez. But why did they say
they didn't get it?

397
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:27,043
-Why the fuss?
-This happened in the city today.

398
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:29,421
An absurd incident
occurred today in Seohan City,

399
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:32,590
where a job fraud victim
had their personal information leaked

400
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,384
and was framed for voice phishing.

401
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:35,552
Here's a video we received.

402
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:38,430
My goodness.

403
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:40,682
Dad, where's the remote? Where is it?

404
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:41,891
-You scared me.
-The remote.

405
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:43,893
What is it?

406
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:45,937
But I was watching the news.

407
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,439
-What's wrong with you?
-Well…

408
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:49,649
It's just that…

409
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:51,484
Your Majesty.

410
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:56,239
Your Majesty,
I ask for your understanding.

411
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:57,324
What are you doing?

412
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:59,326
Go and take a shower!

413
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:02,662
I bought some hanger steak

414
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:04,331
just for you tonight.

415
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:06,666
-Okay?
-You're a butcher's daughter.

416
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:09,252
But you always complained
you never had any Hanwoo to eat.

417
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:13,673
You begged
for premium grade Hanwoo every day.

418
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:17,677
You're the one who said
you couldn't even waste pork on me either.

419
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,304
That was a long time ago.

420
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:23,641
A jobless bum can't compare
to a respectable office worker.

421
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:27,729
Forget it. I don't need it.
Someone like me should starve.

422
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:29,272
What? Are you on a diet?

423
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:34,569
I just want to go to bed early tonight.

424
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:37,947
What's wrong with you?

425
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:39,199
Leave her be.

426
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:42,285
She finally got a job
after seven years of studying.

427
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:43,703
She must be exhausted.

428
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:45,747
She looks so lethargic.

429
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:48,833
Should I make some ox knee soup for her?

430
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,737
I'll eat dinner later.

431
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:26,579
What's this?

432
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:28,832
DEAR DAUGHTER, WEAR THESE
ON YOUR FIRST DAY TO WORK

433
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:41,761
Jeez.

434
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:45,181
Mom!

435
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:46,641
Who told you to buy me shoes?

436
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,977
Why do you keep doing things
out of character?

437
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:52,647
I bought you those.

438
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:55,191
I didn't ask you to buy me shoes, Dad.

439
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:58,695
You barely have any pocket money.
Who said I needed them?

440
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:04,159
What's the matter with that girl?

441
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:06,411
Come on out, you brat!

442
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:10,665
You're proud of barely being able
to get a job after seven years?

443
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:12,792
Stop being so arrogant!

444
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:17,422
LEE MI-JIN, TEST PREP
KOREAN

445
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:23,094
Why are you tossing those out?

446
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,930
You could get money for those
from a used bookstore!

447
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,183
That foolish girl!

448
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:08,890
"Mi" means "small,"
and "jin" means "progress."

449
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:13,269
If you improve little by little,
you'll become someone big one day.

450
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:15,939
It's the meaning behind the humble name
my parents gave me.

451
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:29,702
I often wanted to quit when I couldn't see

452
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:31,621
the light at the end of the tunnel.

453
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:35,166
But I didn't stop or look back.

454
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,168
I kept going without rest.

455
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:46,427
I WILL NEVER STOP

456
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:15,123
What I can confidently say to the person
reading this right now is…

457
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:18,251
Number 27, please come in.

458
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:19,168
Yes, sir.

459
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:24,132
Even though I experienced failure
much more than success in my life,

460
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:27,218
I'll never get tired and stop.

461
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:31,848
And I'll make progress little by little
today and tomorrow.

462
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:48,364
I worked so hard in life.

463
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:52,493
There was never a day
when I didn't work hard.

464
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:04,130
I worked so hard
and didn't rest for a single day.

465
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:08,968
But…

466
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:14,098
what do I have to show for it?

467
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:19,562
Why am I the only one
who ended up like this?

468
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:27,654
You've got to be kidding me.

469
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:29,948
Sure, it might as well rain.

470
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:46,506
This is ridiculous!

471
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:52,929
If you're willing to grant this,
why didn't you just grant me a job?

472
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,445
RÉSUMÉ
NAME: LEE MI-JIN

473
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,204
There it is.

474
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:20,206
Mr. Kim!

475
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:23,876
Mr. Kim Soju!

476
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,753
It's our fourth time meeting.

477
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,507
Now, let's drink!

478
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:32,301
All right, let's drink!

479
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:44,814
What?

480
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:47,233
Hey. You.

481
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:50,737
Aren't you the cat I met earlier?

482
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,448
Do you like me?

483
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:57,994
Or do I look pathetic to you too?

484
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:03,583
Thanks for staying by my side.

485
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:08,087
Thanks. Hey. Damn.

486
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:13,009
What? You just said you liked me.

487
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:16,471
Jeez, you scared me! Hey!

488
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:19,891
Don't go in there! Hey!

489
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:25,813
I wish…

490
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,858
I could just disappear like this…

491
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:31,944
without anyone knowing.

492
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:34,072
Or…

493
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:38,117
I wish I could be someone else.

494
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,943
What's wrong with my body?

495
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:14,987
Did I catch a cold from the rain?

496
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:18,991
It doesn't feel like the flu.

497
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:24,247
My body aches so much.

498
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:38,219
You must've had
a lot of stress while raising kids.

499
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:41,347
A lot of stress!

500
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,683
I feel so nauseous.

501
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:45,101
When did I come in last night?

502
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,485
-Honey, another cucumber.
-Okay.

503
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:59,031
Dad.

504
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:01,075
I feel really weird.

505
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:04,787
Gosh. Your body is tensing up
now that you have to go to work.

506
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:06,330
Mi-jin.

507
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:09,917
-Can you scratch my back?
-Just take a shower.

508
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,878
-Jeez. Here?
-No, next to it.

509
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:14,755
-Here?
-A little lower.

510
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:15,715
Right there.

511
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:20,052
But I do feel really weird, Dad.

512
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:23,139
It feels heavy, and I'm aching all over.

513
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,683
-Is it the hangover?
-That's good.

514
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:28,644
-That's good.
-Did you have hairtail?

515
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:30,354
That feels so good.

516
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:32,398
It feels so nice.

517
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:33,608
What are you doing?

518
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:35,026
What do you think?

519
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:37,528
-What in the world?
-What's with you?

520
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:40,114
-What is this?
-What's going on between you two?

521
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:41,115
What are you saying?

522
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,575
I don't know this lady!

523
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:44,869
Who are you? Why are you in our house?

524
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:46,495
-Who are you?
-Jeez.

525
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,623
What's wrong with you two?

526
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:50,166
-Mi-jin!
-What?

527
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:53,753
-Mi-jin!
-What?

528
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:57,548
-Mi-jin!
-What's wrong with you?

529
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:58,549
Where's Mi-jin?

530
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:01,344
-You really don't know her?
-I told you I don't!

531
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:03,221
-Who is this lady?
-What's with you?

532
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:05,431
I said I'm feeling awful.

533
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:07,892
Mom, where's the medicine?

534
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:10,478
What is with you two?

535
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,230
-Call the cops!
-Okay!

536
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:15,149
Where did I have it wrapped up?

537
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,068
-Leave while I'm being nice.
-What?

538
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:19,237
-Get out.
-Seriously! Stop it!

539
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,738
-Lee Mi-jin!
-What?

540
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:22,531
Who are you, lady?

541
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:25,660
Why are you being like this?
I'm right here!

542
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:26,661
Mom.

543
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:28,996
-This is the police.
-Dad--

544
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,374
Hello! This is 44 Daeho-ri!

545
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:32,291
Yes, that's it.

546
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:34,961
A strange person has broken into our home!

547
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:37,505
Yes, it's some old lady.
She's a total stranger!

548
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:38,839
Why are you doing this?

549
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,508
Is it because of yesterday?

550
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:42,051
I'll tell you everything!

551
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:44,428
-Mom!
-Please come quickly!

552
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:45,513
-Dad!
-Don't!

553
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:47,223
What's with you two?

554
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:48,516
-Seriously!
-Just go!

555
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:50,142
-Just go!
-Mom!

556
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:51,686
Get out right now!

557
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,145
What's with you? Snap out of it!

558
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:54,563
-Get out!
-Please come now!

559
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:56,023
Why are you doing this?

560
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:57,566
Please leave, lady!

561
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:58,776
Get out, lady!

562
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:00,278
-Mi-jin!
-What?

563
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:01,904
-Get out!
-Dad!

564
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,867
They've gone insane!

565
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:09,537
What's with them?

566
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:16,585
Move out of the way!

567
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:17,503
Move!

568
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:20,298
Sir, are you okay?

569
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:21,757
-Do I look okay?
-I'm sorry!

570
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:23,467
Watch where you're going!

571
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:24,969
Damn it!

572
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:27,763
Hey, lady! Get it together, will you?

573
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:32,935
I know I don't have makeup on,
but I'm not old enough to be called that.

574
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:47,575
What's this?

575
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:49,744
What is this?

576
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:54,540
What's wrong with my face?

577
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:58,836
What's going on?

578
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:00,796
You better call your insurance!

579
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,298
-Come fix this!
-What is this belly?

580
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:03,924
Hey! You!

581
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,426
Where are you going?

582
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:07,303
It's the cops!

583
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:09,096
Officer, there's been an accident!

584
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,724
Over here! Someone call my insurance!

585
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:12,683
Ma'am, hold on!

586
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:14,435
Don't move, ma'am!

587
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:16,145
-Just wait.
-Mom, calm down.

588
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:17,938
-Stop calling me that!
-It's me, Mi-jin!

589
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:19,774
-I'm not your mom!
-Over here!

590
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:21,067
Over here!

591
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,234
-Officer!
-What is it?

592
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:23,152
I'm their daughter.

593
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:25,529
No, she's not! She's not our daughter!

594
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:28,824
She keeps calling me "Mom," but I'm not!

595
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:30,117
This is insane!

596
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:32,244
I'm your daughter!

597
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,622
I got this belly overnight!

598
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:37,583
Our daughter doesn't have a potbelly!

599
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:41,045
Who are you?

600
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:45,674
Excuse me, ma'am. What is your name?

601
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:49,845
I'm Lee Mi-jin.

602
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:52,765
-My gosh.
-And your resident registration number?

603
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:54,767
It's 960316…

604
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:55,726
-Nine…
-2651--

605
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,353
What? Born in 1996?

606
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:02,233
Seriously, why are you doing this?

607
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:04,402
She totally planned this.

608
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:07,196
You look normal on the outside,
but you broke into our house.

609
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:08,781
And you're posing as my daughter!

610
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:10,491
-Mom!
-My gosh!

611
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:13,160
-I'm not a stranger! I'm Mi-jin!
-Officer!

612
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:15,079
I said I'm Mi-jin!

613
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:17,915
This is ridiculous!

614
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:18,833
Take a seat.

615
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,167
-Take a seat.
-Mom!

616
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,503
Your birthday is June 13
and blood type is B.

617
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:24,422
And you have a wart on your butt.

618
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:27,383
Dad, you gave me your emergency funds!

619
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:29,051
Jeez!

620
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:31,220
This is crazy!

621
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:33,264
Did you tell her?

622
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:35,891
What's wrong with you? It wasn't me!

623
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:38,978
Then, how does she know
about the wart on my butt?

624
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:39,895
Ma'am.

625
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:43,315
Seriously, who are you?
Do you have something against our family?

626
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:45,734
I'm really Mi-jin!

627
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:48,320
I really am Mi-jin!

628
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:49,822
Sit down! Just sit!

629
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:52,324
Why would you go
into someone else's house?

630
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:54,493
Sir, how old do I look to you?

631
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:57,538
Seriously, I was born in 1996.

632
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:00,458
My goodness!

633
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:01,375
Unbelievable.

634
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:02,376
That's right!

635
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,419
My ID!

636
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:06,213
Here. Look at this. We're the same, right?

637
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,381
-Honey.
-If you look…

638
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:08,841
-That's Mi-jin's wallet!
-Right?

639
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:10,342
-Hey! Her wallet!
-Hey!

640
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:15,598
She stole her clothes too!
She totally planned this!

641
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:17,433
Come here right now.

642
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:18,934
-Come here!
-Honey!

643
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:22,396
-Where's Mi-jin?
-Calm down.

644
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,981
I feel like I'm insane.

645
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:27,234
When I woke up,

646
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:29,320
I looked old like this.

647
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:30,321
I see.

648
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:32,907
Is this a dream? It's not, right?

649
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:33,824
Right?

650
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:38,287
Are there hidden cameras?

651
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:39,663
She must be crazy!

652
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:44,335
I really was born in 1996!

653
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:47,046
I'm going to lose my mind!

654
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:49,673
I was born in 1996!

655
00:41:50,382 --> 00:41:51,592
This is insane!

656
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:52,760
How did this happen?

657
00:42:02,394 --> 00:42:04,480
I don't think she's in her right mind.

658
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:08,192
She doesn't have a guardian,
and she doesn't know her own name.

659
00:42:10,402 --> 00:42:11,403
Is it dementia?

660
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:17,785
This makes no damn sense.

661
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:20,746
This is my face?

662
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:24,542
This is crazy.

663
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:27,086
I think I'm crazy.

664
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:28,629
What do I do?

665
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:30,005
Excuse me?

666
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,425
-Did you really age overnight?
-Yes, sir.

667
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,470
Instead of being here like this,

668
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:38,847
shouldn't you go to a lab somewhere?

669
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:41,642
Or tell your story to that show,
Unanswered Questions?

670
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:43,060
Wait a second.

671
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:45,271
-I know one of the producers.
-No, it's fine.

672
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:46,730
Just wait. It's okay.

673
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:48,524
-No, later--
-It's okay.

674
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:49,775
A lab?

675
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:52,278
By the way,

676
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:54,280
I keep looking at her,

677
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:56,198
and she does look familiar.

678
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:58,617
It's like I've seen her before.

679
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:00,869
-Where?
-I think she's unwell.

680
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:03,330
We'll take care of this.

681
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:04,999
-We'll reprimand her too.
-Okay.

682
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:08,335
I feel bad for her.

683
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:14,675
By the way, can't you scan
her fingerprints and find out who she is?

684
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:16,885
Actually, we're going to scan them

685
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:18,762
and find her place of residence…

686
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,515
What? Where did she go?

687
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:22,433
Where is she?

688
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:24,560
-Hey! Where'd the lady go?
-Where is she?

689
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:25,603
My goodness!

690
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:28,314
She got away! What do we do?

691
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:32,192
Lady, don't come near me again! Move!

692
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:34,153
Move! Damn it!

693
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:38,282
-I'm sorry, sir. I'm sorry.
-Damn it!

694
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:40,326
-Seriously, are you insane?
-I'm sorry.

695
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:42,828
-Ma'am, where are you going?
-Twice in one day!

696
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:45,372
Damn it!

697
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:46,582
Where are you going?

698
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:48,876
-Hey!
-Please stop!

699
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:13,484
Excuse me!

700
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:15,069
A lady came in here, right?

701
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:16,570
Damn it. I'm exhausted.

702
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,280
How was that lady so fast?

703
00:44:18,947 --> 00:44:20,115
Ma'am!

704
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:21,659
Stop playing and come out.

705
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:26,914
What are you doing?

706
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:28,749
Goodness.

707
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:31,168
You thought hiding your head
would make you invisible?

708
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:33,045
What are you, an ostrich? Come out.

709
00:44:33,128 --> 00:44:34,588
Why are you doing this?

710
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,340
-Come on, lady!
-Let go!

711
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:41,595
I said I'm not a strange person!

712
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:43,889
My gosh! I'm sorry!

713
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:46,016
I'm so sorry! Are you okay?

714
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,768
I'm sure she came in here.

715
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:49,561
What's suddenly up with him?

716
00:45:08,705 --> 00:45:09,706
I'm back.

717
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:15,379
I'm back now.

718
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:18,590
I'm back!

719
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:23,095
Ma'am.

720
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:25,722
I look younger, right?

721
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:30,144
Do I look like an old lady?

722
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:32,020
No.

723
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:35,065
Do I look like I'm in my twenties?

724
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:40,779
Mom! Dad!

725
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:42,990
Where have you been?

726
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:45,033
It was total chaos today.

727
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:48,370
Some weird lady
broke into our house this morning.

728
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:49,663
It was no joke.

729
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:51,498
Look.

730
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:54,376
That madwoman had even stolen your wallet.

731
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:57,796
Your mom's preparing to increase
security here in a large way.

732
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,590
What kind of security?

733
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:07,514
Where did you get these clubs?

734
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:09,057
I borrowed them from next door.

735
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:12,394
We didn't have any suitable weapons.
We need to be prepared in advance.

736
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:14,897
-Pick one.
-No, I'm fine.

737
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:16,064
They look scary.

738
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:20,861
Here. You take this.

739
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:21,778
Here.

740
00:46:22,362 --> 00:46:23,197
Okay.

741
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:25,949
After today,

742
00:46:26,783 --> 00:46:28,785
something worse could happen.

743
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:30,204
We need to be prepared.

744
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:35,918
How dare she sneak into our home?

745
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:38,378
-She called me her mom!
-She called me her dad!

746
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:40,672
That was me.

747
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:43,050
Mom!

748
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:45,928
She clearly looked much older than me.

749
00:46:46,011 --> 00:46:47,513
It was ridiculous.

750
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:49,515
I said that was me.

751
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:51,892
But where have you been all day?

752
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:54,311
Were you with Ga-yeong?

753
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:56,855
Yeah.

754
00:46:58,649 --> 00:46:59,650
What's with her?

755
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,454
Wow. What's going on?

756
00:47:13,288 --> 00:47:15,207
Why did I suddenly get old?

757
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:18,961
And how did I come back?

758
00:47:19,044 --> 00:47:20,337
Was it just for a moment?

759
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:22,631
But why just my appearance?

760
00:47:23,423 --> 00:47:26,093
Even if I was a little achy
because of a hangover,

761
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:29,304
but I still had
the same stamina and energy.

762
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:31,390
Damn it.

763
00:47:31,473 --> 00:47:33,267
Is it a disease that ages the face?

764
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:46,613
SUDDENLY OLD…

765
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:49,408
RAPIDLY AGING FACE

766
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,535
What do I do?

767
00:47:51,618 --> 00:47:53,870
RAPIDLY AGING FACE AFTER LOSING BABY FAT

768
00:47:57,874 --> 00:48:02,004
What did I do wrong?
Why did I suddenly get old?

769
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:05,382
Wait.

770
00:48:05,882 --> 00:48:08,343
I was old when I woke up.

771
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:10,512
Was it because of the sun?

772
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:24,818
I can't die yet.

773
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:27,404
I still have so much to do.

774
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:29,406
I have to go on dates,

775
00:48:30,198 --> 00:48:32,618
get a job so I can give
my parents pocket money,

776
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:36,038
and take time off
to travel overseas with Ga-yeong.

777
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:39,625
We said we'd go to famous restaurants.

778
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:00,187
It's morning!

779
00:49:03,523 --> 00:49:04,983
What's happening to me?

780
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:07,277
What is this?

781
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:16,536
Mi-jin! Hey, what's going on?

782
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:18,664
Don't come in!

783
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:20,248
I said don't come!

784
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:21,833
What's the matter, Mi-jin?

785
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:24,336
-Should I come in?
-No.

786
00:49:24,419 --> 00:49:25,962
It's nothing.

787
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:27,631
It's nothing. Don't come in.

788
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:30,884
What's wrong with your voice?

789
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:35,847
I caught a cold.

790
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:37,391
My voice is hoarse.

791
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:39,726
Are you okay?

792
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,144
Yeah, I'm okay.

793
00:49:52,989 --> 00:49:54,199
Am I wearing underwear?

794
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:08,755
The veterinary clinic!

795
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:19,599
Hello. Do you remember me?

796
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:23,603
May I see the cat I left here last night?

797
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:30,110
Okay. Here you go.

798
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:33,822
The cat fell in a well.

799
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:35,365
Can you take a look?

800
00:50:37,492 --> 00:50:41,329
The cat was moved
after treatment but disappeared.

801
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:42,998
This has never happened before.

802
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:45,083
I'm very sorry.

803
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:46,835
Disappeared?

804
00:50:48,503 --> 00:50:49,629
Where did it go?

805
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:54,176
Yeah, I need to find that cat first.

806
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:07,147
MISSING PERSON
NAME: LIM SUN

807
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:14,446
We demand a not-guilty verdict!

808
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:16,323
-Ko! Not guilty!
-Ko! Not guilty!

809
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:17,866
-Ko!
-Not guilty!

810
00:51:17,949 --> 00:51:19,868
We demand a not-guilty verdict!

811
00:51:19,951 --> 00:51:21,077
Not guilty!

812
00:51:37,093 --> 00:51:39,930
Despite substantial evidence
against the defendant,

813
00:51:40,013 --> 00:51:41,598
he has denied the crime itself

814
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:45,852
and has claimed temporary insanity
in an attempt to avoid punishment.

815
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:46,770
DEFENDANT

816
00:51:46,853 --> 00:51:47,938
Your Honor,

817
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:50,857
he is a prominent figure
with large influence on society.

818
00:51:51,691 --> 00:51:54,402
We request that he receives
a more severe punishment.

819
00:51:54,486 --> 00:51:55,654
That is all.

820
00:52:05,413 --> 00:52:06,748
COURT

821
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:14,798
Breaking news.

822
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:17,843
King Land member, Ko Won,
had claimed innocence…

823
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:20,262
Hey, coming soon!

824
00:52:20,887 --> 00:52:22,222
Will he finally appear?

825
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:23,557
Who's all the fuss about?

826
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:25,517
You don't know Prosecutor Gye Ji-ung?

827
00:52:26,184 --> 00:52:27,310
It's Gye Ji-ung!

828
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:33,900
I'm sorry.

829
00:52:40,615 --> 00:52:42,325
He seems like a normal lawyer.

830
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:44,035
He may seem that way,

831
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:46,037
but he changes when he's in work mode,

832
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:47,205
like Jekyll and Hyde.

833
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:50,083
To cover a story,
you should mind your manners first.

834
00:52:50,166 --> 00:52:54,421
Your cheap and prying methods
are why you're called trash journalists.

835
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:56,798
-Unbelievable.
-Seriously?

836
00:52:56,882 --> 00:53:00,802
The Prosecutors' Office was criticized
for being lenient by asking for a fine.

837
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:02,804
Wouldn't you say that it's warranted?

838
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:05,098
Pretending to be close, smart, or tough…

839
00:53:05,181 --> 00:53:06,600
Well, you reap what you sow.

840
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:08,935
So I came to take responsibility.

841
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:11,354
-He hates that.
-Dirty prosecutors made a mess.

842
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:13,815
A proper prosecutor like me
will clean it up.

843
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:15,317
The problem is

844
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:17,485
he knows he's good.

845
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:19,279
I'll respond with my skills.

846
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:21,323
My high conviction rate shows you that.

847
00:53:21,406 --> 00:53:22,782
He's so annoying.

848
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:24,534
Were there any other questions?

849
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:26,369
If not, please move.

850
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:28,830
Then, why was he put
in charge of that big case?

851
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:30,248
He has a bad personality,

852
00:53:30,832 --> 00:53:32,334
but he's the best.

853
00:53:35,837 --> 00:53:36,838
Attack!

854
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:56,483
Who is this jerk?

855
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:57,692
Hey!

856
00:54:04,532 --> 00:54:05,617
What?

857
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:14,501
It's a good thing Mr. Gye
doesn't work at our district office.

858
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:15,418
Wow.

859
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:18,338
Just think of this as Heaven on earth.

860
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:20,757
Welcome to paradise!

861
00:54:23,134 --> 00:54:23,969
Damn it.

862
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:34,104
Damn!

863
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:37,148
Was I really this skinny?

864
00:54:43,196 --> 00:54:44,239
Damn it.

865
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:14,436
Mom.

866
00:55:15,311 --> 00:55:16,563
I'm just borrowing them.

867
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:19,399
The scarf too.

868
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:21,484
Thanks!

869
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:48,845
Goodness.

870
00:55:48,928 --> 00:55:50,013
She's something else.

871
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:00,440
Get up already!

872
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:03,068
Get up!

873
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:07,655
You sleep during the day
and go out at night!

874
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:09,282
No wonder you can't sleep!

875
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:14,829
-Open up.
-I can't.

876
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:16,706
-Open the door!
-No way.

877
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:19,417
You really want to do this?

878
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:20,960
Just you wait.

879
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:22,420
That brat.

880
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:32,639
What do you take me for?

881
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:34,307
You think I can't open this?

882
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:36,351
Just you wait, you brat.

883
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:44,234
Your room is a mess!

884
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:47,237
You're still asleep in bed.

885
00:56:48,196 --> 00:56:50,907
That's why you're getting fat!

886
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:52,742
-You brat!
-That hurts!

887
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:58,081
Come on out!

888
00:56:58,164 --> 00:56:59,666
Why are you so strong?

889
00:57:00,458 --> 00:57:03,128
Come out of there! What's with you?

890
00:57:04,712 --> 00:57:05,588
Seriously!

891
00:57:06,172 --> 00:57:07,257
Are you kidding?

892
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:09,217
At least get some exercise!

893
00:57:10,176 --> 00:57:11,803
Look at the size of your butt!

894
00:57:11,886 --> 00:57:12,887
Goodness!

895
00:57:53,094 --> 00:57:54,554
It's fine.

896
00:57:57,765 --> 00:57:58,975
I can fix this.

897
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:03,521
I'll change back.

898
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:08,109
I can do it.

899
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:11,821
Your face suddenly aged?

900
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:14,866
All of a sudden, I got severely old.

901
00:58:14,949 --> 00:58:17,494
We all have a point
when we suddenly age a few years.

902
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:21,164
It's not just that.
I change when the sun rises and sets.

903
00:58:21,247 --> 00:58:22,248
I become someone else.

904
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:23,917
It sounds like menopause to me.

905
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,043
I'm in my twenties.

906
00:58:25,126 --> 00:58:26,753
You have a daughter in her twenties.

907
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:28,588
Wait, you're in your twenties?

908
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:30,548
-Wait--
-I'm in my twenties!

909
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:31,799
Hey, can we help this lady--

910
00:58:31,883 --> 00:58:34,761
I mean, patient in her twenties
with an appointment?

911
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:37,347
I am in my twenties.
Look at how my skin's changed.

912
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:38,890
It changes every morning.

913
00:58:38,973 --> 00:58:40,266
Okay, I'll put you down for it.

914
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:41,726
Hello.

915
00:58:41,809 --> 00:58:42,977
Excuse me?

916
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:45,772
Will the facial acupuncture
make me younger?

917
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:46,940
Of course, ma'am.

918
00:58:51,277 --> 00:58:52,862
How can I help you, ma'am?

919
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:56,074
My daughter's waiting.

920
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:03,164
Like this.

921
00:59:03,831 --> 00:59:06,918
I won't ask for more or less.
I just want it like this.

922
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:08,503
Ma'am.

923
00:59:08,586 --> 00:59:10,421
Because of your age,

924
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:12,340
it's hard to look exactly like that.

925
00:59:12,423 --> 00:59:14,467
I told you we're the same age.

926
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:39,784
Seriously, what am I going to do?

927
00:59:40,618 --> 00:59:42,495
I'm in my twenties.

928
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:44,247
I was born in 1996.

929
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:47,166
But I change into this when I wake up.

930
00:59:48,126 --> 00:59:48,960
What?

931
00:59:50,086 --> 00:59:51,838
I change into this in the morning.

932
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:53,131
To someone born in 1996?

933
00:59:53,214 --> 00:59:55,300
No, the other way around.

934
00:59:55,383 --> 00:59:56,968
-That's the same thing.
-No--

935
00:59:57,051 --> 00:59:58,261
-You're possessed.
-I am?

936
00:59:58,344 --> 00:59:59,512
Let's find a way.

937
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:03,391
Show me.

938
01:00:03,474 --> 01:00:05,184
Show me the way.

939
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:08,354
Show me.

940
01:00:09,314 --> 01:00:10,607
Why can't I see it?

941
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:12,358
Show me.

942
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:15,403
The spirits are angry. I can't see.

943
01:00:15,486 --> 01:00:18,656
Show me.

944
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:22,410
Here. Show me the way.

945
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:29,000
My goodness!

946
01:00:29,083 --> 01:00:30,209
Jeez, you scared me!

947
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:32,253
-Who are you?
-The person born in 1996.

948
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:33,671
Don't be ridiculous.

949
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:34,756
Where did the lady go?

950
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:35,715
-She was--
-I'm her.

951
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:36,883
Get out. Who are you?

952
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:38,426
I don't want to know. Go!

953
01:00:38,509 --> 01:00:39,802
Go away!

954
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:41,638
-But…
-Go away! Go!

955
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:42,597
Go away!

956
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:36,359
Why?

957
01:01:37,819 --> 01:01:40,279
What did I do wrong?

958
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:45,743
Why do I have to be
an old lady like this? Why?

959
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:53,876
Is someone listening?

960
01:01:55,336 --> 01:01:56,337
It was my fault?

961
01:01:57,296 --> 01:01:59,048
Are you blaming me?

962
01:02:01,175 --> 01:02:02,677
So it is my fault.

963
01:02:04,011 --> 01:02:05,471
I'm the one to blame.

964
01:02:15,481 --> 01:02:16,774
What in the world?

965
01:02:16,858 --> 01:02:19,235
My goodness!

966
01:02:21,612 --> 01:02:22,613
My gosh!

967
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:27,034
Damn.

968
01:02:27,118 --> 01:02:28,536
I almost died.

969
01:02:30,538 --> 01:02:31,622
What is this?

970
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:48,347
My leg!

971
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:49,474
I have a cramp!

972
01:02:54,979 --> 01:02:56,022
What's with her?

973
01:02:56,105 --> 01:02:57,690
I feel like seaweed on a beach.

974
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:04,489
Have you wasted your time doing nothing?

975
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:09,452
Does your future seem
too bleak to start anew?

976
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:13,915
As long as you have passion,
anyone can do it.

977
01:03:14,832 --> 01:03:18,211
All ages, genders,
and educational backgrounds are welcome.

978
01:03:19,086 --> 01:03:21,506
Take the challenge now!

979
01:03:22,089 --> 01:03:25,134
We are waiting for you!

980
01:03:25,218 --> 01:03:27,428
Yeah, I can't let it end like this.

981
01:03:27,512 --> 01:03:30,139
I can't give up
without ever getting a job.

982
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:33,017
Never having a proper job

983
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:35,228
before turning 30

984
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:38,147
is a disservice to my weary twenties!

985
01:03:52,995 --> 01:03:54,622
PUBLIC JOBS
FOR DISPLACED WORKERS

986
01:03:59,919 --> 01:04:01,128
Ms. Lim Sun?

987
01:04:01,212 --> 01:04:02,046
Yes!

988
01:04:02,129 --> 01:04:04,173
-Mr. Ko Deok-hun.
-Yes!

989
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:05,675
-Ms. Kang I-deok.
-Yes!

990
01:04:05,758 --> 01:04:07,009
-Ms. Baek Hwa-ja.
-Yes!

991
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:08,511
Please come in.

992
01:04:21,649 --> 01:04:23,234
-Ms. Lim Sun.
-Yes, sir?

993
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:25,736
You're very young.

994
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:26,654
Excuse me?

995
01:04:26,737 --> 01:04:28,614
You're our youngest applicant.

996
01:04:30,157 --> 01:04:30,992
I see.

997
01:04:34,287 --> 01:04:37,915
How much wood would a woodchuck chuck
if a woodchuck could chuck wood?

998
01:04:39,166 --> 01:04:40,585
Your pronunciation is great.

999
01:04:40,668 --> 01:04:42,336
These are all my natural teeth.

1000
01:04:45,339 --> 01:04:47,967
I can speak very clearly as well.

1001
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:49,552
How much wood could…

1002
01:04:50,136 --> 01:04:51,262
-If--
-Thank you.

1003
01:04:57,852 --> 01:04:59,312
You're very flexible.

1004
01:05:00,354 --> 01:05:02,106
I can do other things too.

1005
01:05:02,189 --> 01:05:03,357
Sorry, you can't come out.

1006
01:05:03,441 --> 01:05:04,358
Please go back to…

1007
01:05:12,366 --> 01:05:13,659
On the banner behind me,

1008
01:05:13,743 --> 01:05:16,662
next to where it says
"Seohan City Hall Senior Internship,"

1009
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:19,165
"Program" is spelled incorrectly.

1010
01:05:19,248 --> 01:05:21,709
It's spelled with an "R,"
not an "L." Right?

1011
01:05:22,668 --> 01:05:24,462
Wow, that's incredible.

1012
01:05:24,545 --> 01:05:26,088
Your English is great too.

1013
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:27,965
You even found that small typo.

1014
01:05:28,049 --> 01:05:32,053
-You must have good vision too.
-Yes, I have naturally perfect vision.

1015
01:05:32,678 --> 01:05:34,472
Do you know any other languages?

1016
01:05:34,555 --> 01:05:40,978
Learning a second language
is the first step to globalization!

1017
01:05:54,867 --> 01:05:56,619
PROSECUTOR GYE JI-UNG

1018
01:06:04,126 --> 01:06:05,419
Your transfer notice to Seohan.

1019
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:07,672
Hey.

1020
01:06:08,422 --> 01:06:11,676
Everyone tries so hard to come to Seoul,
even using their connections.

1021
01:06:11,759 --> 01:06:14,345
So why do you want to go down to Seohan?

1022
01:06:18,724 --> 01:06:21,435
Directing you
to Seohan District Prosecutors' Office.

1023

SENIOR INTERNSHIP PROGRAM
LIST OF HIRINGS

1024
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:13,446
It's up.

1025
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:35,301
SELECTED APPLICANTS

1026
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:44,643
LIM SUN

1027
01:07:45,478 --> 01:07:46,479
It's there.

1028
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:50,316
"Lim Sun."

1029
01:07:59,617 --> 01:08:01,077
I got it.

1030
01:08:14,715 --> 01:08:15,800
I got the job.

1031
01:08:18,427 --> 01:08:19,720
I did it!

1032
01:08:21,305 --> 01:08:22,973
I really did it.

1033
01:08:24,934 --> 01:08:27,353
Not me, but Lim Sun did it.

1034
01:08:28,729 --> 01:08:30,189
I got the job!

1035
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:36,320
My gosh. That hurt.

1036
01:08:37,446 --> 01:08:38,864
I really got it.

1037
01:08:43,828 --> 01:08:47,498
I got the job!

1038
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:54,130
I did it!

1039
01:08:54,213 --> 01:08:58,050
I got the job!

1040
01:08:58,134 --> 01:08:59,468
I did it!

1041
01:08:59,552 --> 01:09:00,511
Finally!

1042
01:09:33,627 --> 01:09:36,547
MISS NIGHT AND DAY

1043
01:09:37,798 --> 01:09:41,927
My friend, Mi-jin, finally has a job.
Who knew I'd live to see the day?

1044
01:09:43,304 --> 01:09:45,431
You haven't started cleaning yet?

1045
01:09:45,931 --> 01:09:48,350
What's he doing here?

1046
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:51,228
I better not get involved with him at all.

1047
01:09:51,854 --> 01:09:53,105
This is so chaotic.

1048
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:54,190
Please come again.

1049
01:09:54,273 --> 01:09:56,734
I don't know if this is a miracle or not,

1050
01:09:56,817 --> 01:09:58,944
but it seems related to that cat somehow.

1051
01:09:59,486 --> 01:10:00,988
The culprit is still at the scene.

1052
01:10:02,823 --> 01:10:04,074
Ms. Lee Mi-jin!

1053
