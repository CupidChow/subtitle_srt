1
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:45,962
MISS NIGHT AND DAY

2
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,302
-Goodness.
-A special position?

3
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:53,595
Are you okay?

4
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,015
Yes, well…

5
00:00:57,098 --> 00:01:01,144
It's better than being a contract worker.
You're practically a civil servant.

6
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,021
Gosh.

7
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:05,482
My dream was to become a civil servant.

8
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,069
That's great!

9
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:11,404
It's settled then!

10
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:15,533
What's wrong?

11
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:21,456
But does it have to be for Mr. Gye?

12
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:23,458
Hey! Come on!

13
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,711
It seems you've heard the rumors,

14
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:29,547
but they're not true at all.

15
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:33,885
Mr. Gye's not as grouchy, sensitive,
or difficult as you think he is.

16
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:35,637
He's not like that at all!

17
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,263
Well, maybe a little.

18
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:38,765
Yeah. Just a tiny bit.

19
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:44,604
Then, does that mean Mr. Gye…

20
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,732
What?

21
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,530
I already knew.

22
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:55,990
He's the "cold exterior" type.

23
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,493
-Cold what?
-The "cold exterior" type.

24
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:01,830
He's cold on the outside,

25
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:05,125
but he secretly gifts people
items they've lost

26
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,042
without telling.

27
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:10,171
Okay, so…

28
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:11,840
you'll do it, right?

29
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:13,758
My goodness.

30
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,593
Gosh. It's such a difficult choice.

31
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,345
Should I do it?

32
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:19,681
Goodness.

33
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:23,226
You both want me to accept,
so I can't refuse.

34
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:24,602
What do I do?

35
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,062
So will you do it or not?

36
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,107
I'll give it a try.

37
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:33,653
Here. Have some tea.

38
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,365
There's no going back.

39
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:42,036
It's hot.

40
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:47,458
What did he want?

41
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,002
What was it?

42
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:50,920
Why did he want to see you?

43
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,046
Well…

44
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,174
-You did something wrong, didn't you?
-Stop that, will you?

45
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,385
They didn't even give her a second reward.

46
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:59,596
Just what in the world did you do wrong?

47
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,264
Why would he ask to see you?

48
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:04,100
Good grief.

49
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:05,935
Just a moment.

50
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:06,853
-What?
-Why?

51
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:10,231
What happened?

52
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,567
Something happened. I'm sure of it.

53
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:14,694
You're really a civil servant?

54
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:17,405
No, not yet.

55
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:18,990
-Cheers.
-The special position.

56
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:21,868
It's, like, a civil servant.
And you're an office aide.

57
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,828
Like a semi-public servant?

58
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:26,289
So I was wondering…

59
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:29,667
-Yeah?
-Can you help me do my makeup tomorrow?

60
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:35,590
What are you doing?

61
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:36,591
What is this?

62
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,929
This prosecutor, Mr. Gye. Do you like him?

63
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:44,015
No! No way!

64
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:45,600
It's not that.

65
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:48,811
I'm much older
than the prosecutor, you know.

66
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,355
-You?
-Me.

67
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:52,732
Not me at night, but me during the day.

68
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:55,652
The changed me.

69
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:58,696
The changed you. Okay.

70
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:02,158
Mr. Gye could feel a little uncomfortable.

71
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,576
Right, he could.

72
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,703
Also for me…

73
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,915
It's a bit uncomfortable. That's why.

74
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,586
Yeah, sure.

75
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,673
After the sun rises and you change,

76
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,341
I'll give it a try.

77
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:19,259
Okay.

78
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:22,428
Still, congratulations!
I can't believe it!

79
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,889
Great job, Mi-jin!

80
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:27,267
Do I get to see your real skills?

81
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,314
What are you doing?

82
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,358
I still can't get used to it.

83
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:40,530
Come on, Ga-yeong.

84
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,240
Yes, ma'am.

85
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,885
Smile for me. Just like that.

86
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:13,688
Lift your head.

87
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:21,571
You really are
a good beauty content creator.

88
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,449
Is old lady makeup that different?

89
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,036
The more you age,
we have to focus on your skin tone.

90
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:31,748
Yeah.

91
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:34,167
Using colors to contour
and blushers for shine

92
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,419
as if you're in your twenties can look…

93
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,087
It makes you look out of style.

94
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:41,466
Maybe a little more?

95
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,636
But if this were a miracle,

96
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,180
time would usually stop

97
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:48,556
or go to the past or future.

98
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,016
But why did this happen?

99
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:50,933
Damn it.

100
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:53,811
What if it's a curse?

101
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,647
-A curse?
-You could've become younger.

102
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,983
But you aged. This is ridiculous.

103
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,280
Instead of helping the cat,
did you abuse it?

104
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:09,160
I may not be kind,
but I don't do bad things. You know that.

105
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:11,204
I do.

106
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,748
Okay. Forget it.

107
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,960
Seeing as how everything
is playing out nicely,

108
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,004
maybe this is for the best.

109
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,341
Since it's turned out like this,

110
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:25,343
I'm going to keep at it until the end.

111
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:26,761
What happens then, ma'am?

112
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,097
-I'll kill you.
-What happens?

113
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:35,353
My twenties were full of failures,
but if I were to go back,

114
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:38,773
I think I can start over again.

115
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:42,276
Ga-yeong.

116
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,571
I've worked so hard

117
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:48,241
but never achieved anything.

118
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:51,494
So this time,

119
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,913
I want to see.

120
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:56,874
If I do my best,

121
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,128
I want to see how well I can do.

122
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,716
You really are Mi-jin.

123
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,553
I told you I was.

124
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,429
-Sorry.
-It is you!

125
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:16,602
I'll do my best to support you.

126
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,362
Unbelievable!

127
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:40,251
I know how uncomfortable you are
working with older people.

128
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:45,173
Since it's come to this,
the best is to have her quit on her own.

129
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:49,260
There are no applicants,
and you saw the deputy chief.

130
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:50,845
If she quits on her own,

131
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:53,973
do you really think
he'd hire someone older?

132
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,060
Honestly, she's past her prime.

133
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,937
She lacks stamina
and can't communicate.

134
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,273
She can try,
but she'll last a month at best.

135
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:04,775
No, if you put your mind to it
and pressure her,

136
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,110
she won't last a week.

137
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:10,072
How many young and energetic
office assistants have worked with you?

138
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,450
At least three or four quit on their own.

139
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:13,826
You have a talent for it.

140
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:19,332
I'm saying there's still hope.

141
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:54,784
I promise to do my best to support you.

142
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,706
Okay, I look forward to it.

143
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,045
Thank you, sir.

144
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,595
-You can let go.
-Right.

145
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,867
Ms. Lim?

146
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,119
Yes, sir!

147
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:40,955
-Could I have a moment?
-Yes, sir.

148
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,960
Organize these legal precedents
into documents before noon.

149
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,587
Yes, sir.

150
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:56,012
You can't scan them.
You have to type them by hand.

151
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:00,975
-All of these?
-Of course.

152
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:03,227
Yes, sir.

153
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:11,819
That'll be tough even if you can type
1,000 words per minute.

154
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:17,825
Don't be so obvious.

155
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:45,895
PART-TIME EXPERIENCE AS PAID CHATTER
CAN TYPE 1,000 WPM ON AVERAGE

156
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,066
Okay, let's work
and get paid on the same day!

157
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,577
No. No way!

158
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:12,421
It's all done.

159
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:14,423
Already?

160
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:17,134
You said to finish before noon, so I did.

161
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,767
Check to see if she did this right.

162
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,022
All of these?

163
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:32,983
Yes.

164
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:02,930
It took her two hours to type them
and over four hours for you to check.

165
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:04,849
Isn't that a big drop in efficiency?

166
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:07,476
Four hours, my foot.
I'm not even halfway done.

167
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,894
You know how hard this is?

168
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:11,272
If you can't see up close,
wear glasses then!

169
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:13,649
It's taking forever
because you're reading so slowly.

170
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:16,861
-Any spelling errors?
-Spelling errors?

171
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:19,530
She didn't even miss a single space.

172
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,282
I mean…

173
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:22,700
did she work as a typist?

174
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:24,493
You should've pressured her more.

175
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,495
More how?

176
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,873
Have some coffee as you work.

177
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:29,832
Coffee…

178
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:31,959
Thank you.

179
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:38,424
Taste it for me.

180
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:43,429
Organize our accounting records in Excel.

181
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:46,557
Attach the necessary quarterly statements
and the annual plan

182
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,142
and save them to the shared folders.

183
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:51,187
So you're saying you want me

184
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,606
to create Excel spreadsheets for this?

185
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:55,065
Yes.

186
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:58,444
Using functions is hard,
so I'm sure you won't know.

187
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,699
If you can't do it--

188
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:07,203
I'll classify the supplies
by their codes and set it up

189
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,830
so it extracts characters
with the MID function.

190
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:12,249
Combined with the FIND function,
if you separate the text,

191
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,211
you could check by number,
manufacturer, and quantity.

192
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,964
So if I start with cell C…

193
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:29,099
Mid, parenthesis, C5, find, parenthesis,
slash in quotes, C5, close parenthesis.

194
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:32,269
Plus one, find, parenthesis,
slash in quotes, C5, find.

195
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:35,773
Parenthesis, slash, C5, close parenthesis,
plus one, close parenthesis, minus find.

196
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:39,693
Slash, C5 in parenthesis,
minus one, close parenthesis.

197
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,783
I'll use three FIND functions

198
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:49,078
and make a formula that will manage
the supplies efficiently.

199
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,373
Okay, not bad.

200
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,668
Yes, not bad.

201
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,600
2022 FIRST QUARTER FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

202
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:18,315
Compared to every office assistant
I've seen so far,

203
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,110
this quality of work is far superior and…

204
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,990
Just in case,

205
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,242
I made it into a program.

206
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:29,618
You have programming skills?

207
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,162
Yes, I studied coding for a while.

208
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,458
I put it in the shared folder.

209
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:37,793
If you could take a look…

210
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,891
What are we going to do now?

211
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,477
-What?
-What are we going to do now?

212
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:56,729
Now!

213
00:14:56,812 --> 00:15:00,065
She can master computer skills effort,

214
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,109
but she can't keep up with the youth!

215
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:03,110
What did you say?

216
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,613
She can't keep up with the youth!

217
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:06,697
Allow me

218
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:08,866
to show you!

219
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:50,783
Thank you for today.

220
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:51,909
I'll be going now.

221
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:53,619
Before you go…

222
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:56,914
We'd like to order dinner.

223
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,249
Okay, I'll order it.

224
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,460
-Let's have something simple.
-What?

225
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:02,753
Delivery food is too heavy.

226
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,797
-I don't want that.
-Me neither.

227
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,341
Can you buy us something from around here?

228
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:10,970
Okay, I'll be back soon.

229
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,639
How about something simple
from a nearby cafe?

230
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,268
A medium-well steak.
Don't overcook the asparagus.

231
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:19,603
It should have a crunch.

232
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,313
Mr. Gye's sensitive to spices,

233
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:23,399
so no garlic flakes or black pepper.

234
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,442
Ask the chef directly
to make the sauce.

235
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,736
-A glace de viande.
-The what?

236
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,321
Glace de viande.

237
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,073
I see. "Glace de viande."

238
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:32,783
Okay.

239
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:37,037
I want a burger on honey grain
with a lot of lettuce,

240
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:38,956
thinly cut tomatoes,
and cooked onions.

241
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:41,000
Make sure the olives
and pickles don't fall out.

242
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,919
Also, I'm vegan,
so no bacon and add cheese.

243
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:46,922
-Okay.
-For drinks…

244
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,757
-There's more?
-I'm just getting started.

245
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:53,178
I want a latte with two shots
but not too hot.

246
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,014
Add hazelnut and vanilla syrup.

247
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,016
I want milk foam instead of whipped cream.

248
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:59,601
Add a mocha drizzle
and the whipped cream too.

249
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,228
A lot of chocolate chips.

250
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:02,146
What? A lot!

251
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:03,480
-A lot. What?
-A lot.

252
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:04,732
-Yes, a lot.
-Right.

253
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:07,526
Also, I'm on a diet,
so make it low-fat milk and decaf.

254
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:09,445
Don't forget it

255
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:10,946
I'll be right back!

256
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,374
We did it!

257
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,126
Don't go overboard.

258
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,796
Man, I'm late now.

259
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,256
TAKEOUT, PICK-UP AVAILABLE

260
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:30,716
Number 82.

261
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:31,800
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

262
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:36,722
TAKEOUT, PICK-UP COMPLETE

263
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:43,520
It won't be easy
to find a place for my order.

264
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,647
Not to mention, it's the dinner rush.

265
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,524
After waiting in line,

266
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:48,942
it'll already be sold out.

267
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,071
My gosh!

268
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:57,159
The layered latte is seasonal drink,
so I got a free gift too.

269
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,327
-You did?
-Here.

270
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,787
I'll be going now.

271
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:02,748
Wait, hold on.

272
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,668
Is this…

273
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,128
Is this possible?

274
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,798
What just happened?

275
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:12,758
This is impossible.

276
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:16,553
Isn't that Ko Won?

277
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:17,554
-It's not.
-Ko Won!

278
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:18,847
-Ko Won!
-He's so handsome!

279
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:21,100
Ko Won, over here!

280
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,142
Ko Won!

281
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:24,520
Hey, Ko Won!

282
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:26,814
This is insane!

283
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:29,858
Ko Won!

284
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:33,737
Hey, Ko Won!

285
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:51,588
Ma'am!

286
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:00,597
Ma'am!

287
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,414
Ma'am…

288
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:01,867
I swear it was her though.

289
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:21,595
Goodness.

290
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:23,931
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm okay.

291
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:25,474
You look like death.

292
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:26,892
You're not okay.

293
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:28,977
-Let me see.
-Mom.

294
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,104
-Forget it. It's fine.
-Stay still.

295
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:32,564
Mom!

296
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,650
-Cramp!
-Is it a cramp?

297
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,110
-Cramp!
-Is it a cramp?

298
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:40,322
Goodness.

299
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:43,200
Your legs are all swollen.

300
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,118
Lightly, Mom.

301
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:47,788
Do you just run around all day?

302
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,959
Still, it's nice.

303
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:53,043
What?

304
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,170
Now that I'm working,

305
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,298
it feels so nice.

306
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:03,470
I love it so much but…

307
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:07,641
I'm sad since I can't work
in my normal appearance.

308
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,229
Why did you stop in the middle? But what?

309
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:14,314
It's nothing.

310
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,276
Forget it. It's fine.

311
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:20,279
Mom, with my first paycheck,
what should I get you and Dad?

312
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:21,905
I've always wanted to do that.

313
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:24,116
I'll buy you two whatever you want.

314
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,286
It's not like we paid for your studies.

315
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,331
You earned money on your own
to pay for your studies.

316
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:34,376
Don't waste your money and save it.

317
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,921
Spending it on you two isn't a waste.

318
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:40,882
Tell me. Do you want new clothes?

319
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:43,135
A bag?

320
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:45,637
Forget it. I don't need anything.

321
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:49,099
Get your dad
some fur-lined boots for winter.

322
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:51,727
They're so worn out
I'm scared he might slip and fall

323
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,020
at the slaughterhouse.

324
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:55,439
Jeez.

325
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,525
I should've bought those a long time ago.

326
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:03,196
If you buy those for him,
he'd wear them until his feet got sore.

327
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,076
Okay, give me your legs.

328
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,786
No. Let me do it for you, Mom.

329
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:11,371
Wow.

330
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,332
-Your fingers won't work.
-Nope.

331
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:14,416
-I'm made of rock.
-Yeah.

332
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:15,751
Lie down.

333
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,712
All right. Let's switch legs.

334
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:19,838
Here we go.

335
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:23,008
SEOHAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

336
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:24,843
You want me to go where?

337
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:26,595
Obongsan Mountain.

338
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:29,848
Why do I have to go to Obongsan right now?

339
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:32,350
The summons we sent
kept returning, so I checked.

340
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:35,520
The victim moved into the mountains
to live as a recluse.

341
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,147
-So that mountain is--
-Obongsan.

342
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,484
Give this to him in person.

343
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:42,069
Having him appear would be best.

344
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:43,570
SEOHAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

345
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:45,572
But it's hard to go dressed like this.

346
00:22:46,364 --> 00:22:49,993
You'll have to leave now
to be back before lunch.

347
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,369
Lunch? Not dinner?

348
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:52,370
Yes.

349
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:55,457
-I guess it'd be tough due to your age--
-No!

350
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,043
I'll be back soon.

351
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,095
Gosh.

352
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:10,555
It's impossible to do in a day.

353
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,641
A round trip to Obongsan Mountain.

354
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:13,725
You're the best.

355
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:15,894
You're amazing, Mr. Gye.

356
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:19,106
You sure have a talent
for working people to the bone…

357
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:24,903
I wonder if she'll make it back alive.

358
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:38,834
How did they know
I wasn't built for hiking?

359
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:53,140
PART-TIME EXPERIENCE AT CLIMBING GYM

360
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:56,393
ROCK CLIMBING LEVEL 10

361
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:23,378
I'm so glad I made it on time.

362
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:27,465
Did you have lunch?
Do you want some dumplings?

363
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:29,384
It's okay. I ate with him.

364
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,261
Him?

365
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:33,930
He promised to appear in court next week.

366
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:50,030
Who in the world is she?

367
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:55,577
I'm sure she was the same person.

368
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,207
What is this?

369
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:02,542
Is it makeup?

370
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,503
But it's so real.

371
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:09,466
Ma'am!

372
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:31,988
MISSING CAT

373
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:33,907
Ma'am?

374
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:36,993
Excuse me.

375
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:39,412
I'm looking for a cat
that looks like this.

376
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:41,623
This isn't the same one.

377
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:45,252
If a similar cat comes in by chance,

378
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:46,544
could you please call?

379
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:48,838
-Please call.
-Okay.

380
00:25:55,595 --> 00:26:02,018
MISSING CAT
REWARD 300,000 WON

381
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:03,937
-Fentanyl?
-Yes.

382
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,897
Traces of it were found in the blood.

383
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:12,112
If it's fentanyl,
it could be a drug patch.

384
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:15,532
They say the drugs he was on
are new ones popular at clubs.

385
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:17,325
It's a modified drug patch.

386
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:21,413
Fentanyl was found
in Kang Gyeong-hui's corpse.

387
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:23,498
But she had no illnesses.

388
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:24,666
Right.

389
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:28,461
Wait, does that mean someone injected her?

390
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:30,463
-Mom…
-Or did she inject herself?

391
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:33,508
Mom…

392
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:38,513
You said the detective in charge
of the case back then had retired.

393
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:40,390
Well, it happened a long time ago.

394
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:41,641
So I'm sure he's retired.

395
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:43,977
Could I get his name and number?

396
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,603
Sure, I'll look into it.

397
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:56,656
Six, four, three, eight.

398
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:00,285
Six, four, three, eight. Was it him?

399
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:07,959
If it was him, why would he make such
a risky move and return to the scene?

400
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:11,421
For what reason?

401
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,384
He's looking for something.

402
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,678
Or someone.

403
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:20,805
What could it be?

404
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:26,353
SEOHAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

405
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:35,779
Are you free today?

406
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,085
Are you avoiding me on purpose?

407
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:56,049
It's been a while.

408
00:27:58,426 --> 00:28:00,053
I heard you got a big case.

409
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:05,141
Deal with the crazy acid thrower
and help calm the chief down quick.

410
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:08,520
You have a lot
of unnecessary interest in me.

411
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:11,064
I've had a crush on you. Didn't you know?

412
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:14,609
I've been longing for you since college.

413
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:18,113
Stop giving me so much attention.
It's not worth anything.

414
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:23,660
I'm not someone who bases
their feelings for someone on worth.

415
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:25,537
SEOHAN MUTILATION MURDER CASE

416
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:28,081
The autopsy report's still not out?

417
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:34,796
Stay away from my case!

418
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:39,050
Okay?

419
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:43,179
You better stay away from my case.

420
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:45,265
Weren't you jealous that I got a big case?

421
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:47,475
Take mine and give me yours.

422
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,561
I don't know why you're here,

423
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:53,022
but while you were on TV,
swarmed by reporters at Seoul Central…

424
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:56,776
I spent three years here
dealing with greenhouse arson,

425
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,653
attempted murder with pesticides,

426
00:28:58,737 --> 00:28:59,863
low-stakes gambling,

427
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:02,532
senior center assaults, antler theft,
and rotating savings fraud!

428
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:06,578
This is the first real case I've ever had.

429
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:08,288
Don't touch it.

430
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:10,165
Yeah, you've worked hard.

431
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:13,042
Well, I was thinking about
how to handle this.

432
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:15,003
I just got a firearm-related death case.

433
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:17,505
When? Where? And the victim?

434
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,924
The victim…

435
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:23,094
is a boar.

436
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,012
Yeah.

437
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:27,056
Damn it.

438
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:46,493
You're the senior intern
who was assigned to Mr. Gye, right?

439
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:49,078
Yes.

440
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,331
Be careful of him.

441
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:53,458
He may not look it,

442
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:56,836
but he's much more
of a jerk than you think.

443
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:04,761
Me and my big mouth. Why did I laugh?

444
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:07,222
Jeez.

445
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,072
Hello?

446
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:25,990
Why haven't you texted me back?

447
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:28,868
Sorry, I work during the day.

448
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:30,995
It's hard for me to check on time.

449
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:32,997
What? I can't hear you. Where are you?

450
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:35,750
Well,

451
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:39,379
I don't get… service… here.

452
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:45,176
I'd like to see you today.

453
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:48,388
I see. I can't during the day,
but I could see you tonight.

454
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:50,807
Let's meet
at that coffee shop from before.

455
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:52,600
From before when?

456
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,018
What's wrong with her voice?

457
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:56,521
Is this Lee Mi-jin?

458
00:30:58,481 --> 00:30:59,732
Yes, it's me.

459
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:02,110
Remember where you were scammed?

460
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:03,736
Yes, that place.

461
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,154
Okay, goodbye.

462
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:27,635
Are you okay?

463
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:40,064
Thanks for bringing me my stuff.

464
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,524
How have you been?

465
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:42,734
Just fine.

466
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:45,403
It's so nice to not see Gye Ji-ung.

467
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:47,030
Whenever I think about that jerk--

468
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:48,865
-Still.
-Crazy bastard.

469
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:50,491
He continues to be handsome.

470
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,785
Don't be fooled by his appearance.

471
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:54,454
That bastard's insane.

472
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:03,212
Goodness.

473
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:05,798
Why?

474
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:07,759
Why do I have to be here and do this?

475
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:09,135
Why?

476
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,182
Damn it.

477
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:21,731
Hey, lady!

478
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:23,942
There are no tissues again!

479
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:25,902
Hurry up and bring some toilet paper.

480
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:30,031
I said it's urgent!

481
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:32,450
Hey, lady!

482
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:36,329
Here you go.

483
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:38,206
Hurry it up. Damn it.

484
00:32:58,184 --> 00:32:59,060
Damn it.

485
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:08,569
Goodness, I'm sorry.

486
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,947
I thought there was a fire.

487
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:12,782
Are you okay, miss?

488
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:14,617
Are you insane, lady?

489
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:16,035
Are you crazy? Hey--

490
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:19,831
Your face is all wet. My goodness!

491
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:21,374
That's a rag!

492
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,209
Miss.

493
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:26,879
Do you know how much the fine is
for smoking in a non-smoking area?

494
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,297
You must be rich.

495
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:29,841
-I'm sorry.
-Goodness.

496
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:31,759
Look at how wet you are.

497
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:34,012
Help me!

498
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,596
Someone help me!

499
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:38,266
I'm wiping her face. What's with her?

500
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:41,269
Serves you right.

501
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:46,691
The drug patch Ji Dong-kwon used
had traces of fentanyl, right?

502
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:47,734
Probably.

503
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:51,738
After dealing with drug offenders,
I even look at their brain synapses now.

504
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:54,073
Ji Dong-kwon has four
previous drug convictions,

505
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:55,742
which means he's serious about drugs.

506
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:58,703
At that stage, it's common
to not act consistently.

507
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:00,705
Consistently?

508
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:04,542
It's like speeding at 200 km/h
while high on drugs,

509
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:06,002
causing an eight-car pile-up,

510
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:09,088
stealing a car in the chaos,
and ramming it into a cop car.

511
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,299
A literal ticking time bomb.

512
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:16,512
But he left behind evidence
along every step of the way.

513
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,893
Shouldn't you at least buy
the acid in person?

514
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:23,144
He buys his drugs in person.

515
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:25,396
That's true.

516
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:28,941
There's no need to buy it online
and leave evidence.

517
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:32,361
-Should I check his illegal account again?
-Just a moment.

518
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:36,032
He purchased sulfuric acid
online on the 3rd at 2:00 a.m.

519
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:39,202
He signed up for Ko Won's fan club
and checked his schedule.

520
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:42,622
He stalked him and waited by his house,
but when that didn't work,

521
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:46,084
he decided to take him out on a day
when all the reporters were there?

522
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:48,628
Does that make sense?

523
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:50,671
No, it doesn't.

524
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:54,133
Look into all transactions related
to fentanyl in Seohan City.

525
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:56,677
It's new,
so it hasn't been out for that long.

526
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:59,555
Maybe about a year?

527
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:03,226
That's around the same time
when Ji Dong-kwon moved here. Interesting.

528
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,061
I'll look right into it.

529
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:08,397
Damn it.
Why does he suddenly want to meet?

530
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:10,733
Jeez, it's bothering me so much.

531
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:11,859
It seems you have plans.

532
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,111
What?

533
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:14,654
Why are you so scared?

534
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:18,199
Yes, to be honest…

535
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:20,284
I have a weak heart.

536
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:24,163
Could you look for an SUV registered
in Seohan City with the number 6438?

537
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:25,540
What's the first part?

538
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:26,916
That's all I know.

539
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:30,002
I can't find it right away.
I think it'll take a few days.

540
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:30,920
Okay.

541
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:32,964
Submit the warrant request and go home.

542
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:34,340
What?

543
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,135
What is it this time?

544
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:41,264
It'll be so late
when I'm done with all of that.

545
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:07,498
I'm sorry, but something urgent came up.
I'll be a bit late.

546
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:08,583
I'm sorry.

547
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:13,588
Maybe don't do things you need to
apologize for in the first place then.

548
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:21,554
Hello.

549
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:38,863
I'm a witness to a murder?

550
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:41,908
I'm not sure yet.
We're still investigating.

551
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:45,161
We're not sure
if the victim is still alive.

552
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:48,956
In any case,
the person I saw was the culprit.

553
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:58,382
What is this?

554
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,303
Could you give me a few items
that are good for self-defense?

555
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:04,180
You've never asked for that before.

556
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,682
I doubt it's for you.

557
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:08,726
Who's it for?

558
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,686
Someone important.

559
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:13,356
-Your girlfriend?
-More important than a girlfriend.

560
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:15,816
Be careful with that.

561
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,443
Press the button and it'll zap you.

562
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:18,653
I'll take this too.

563
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:21,530
Do you have that too?

564
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:23,824
Have these with you just in case.

565
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:27,286
I'll call the cops if I'm in danger.
I don't think I need these.

566
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:32,375
That scared me.

567
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:39,882
I arrived 40 minutes ago.

568
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:51,394
PROSECUTOR GYE JI-UNG

569
00:37:58,317 --> 00:38:00,194
Here are the drinks you ordered.

570
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:05,950
Thank you.

571
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:09,287
I saved my number in your shortcuts.

572
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,831
Call me right away
if something dangerous happens.

573
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:13,416
It doesn't matter when or where.

574
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:15,334
Okay.

575
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:20,423
But if I'm a witness,

576
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:22,925
why haven't the police called me yet?

577
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:24,635
-I didn't tell them.
-Why not?

578
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,470
-Because of trust.
-You don't trust me?

579
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:28,764
-I can't trust the police.
-Wait.

580
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,267
What I don't understand is

581
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:34,228
you're a prosecutor,
but you don't trust law enforcement.

582
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:37,273
What if you came to the station
as a witness, got exposed,

583
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:38,357
and became a target?

584
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:40,443
So you should catch the culprit sooner.

585
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:42,778
Is there anything I can testify to?

586
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:45,531
I've already reported everything you said.

587
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:49,327
So even if you get involved,
there's nothing more you can do.

588
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,494
Still.

589
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:53,289
Getting involved could put you
in danger so listen to me.

590
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:56,625
What if they come after me?

591
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:58,836
We need to catch them.

592
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:01,756
So until then, you can trust me.

593
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:15,978
Answer when I call. I'll do the same.

594
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:19,065
Okay. I won't stay out late either.

595
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:21,067
The sun doesn't stop murderers.

596
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:24,278
I mean you should always be careful.

597
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:26,822
Why did you tell me that?

598
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:29,283
I would've at least been comfortable
if I didn't know.

599
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:30,993
Ignorance is bliss.

600
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:32,953
And what if something really happens?

601
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:43,506
I'll go now.

602
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:52,014
You don't have to get out.

603
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:53,557
I'll see you to the door.

604
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:55,601
You don't need to do that.

605
00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:58,187
Go on in.

606
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:01,107
Thank you.

607
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:37,726
We need to catch them.

608
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:38,936
So until then…

609
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:42,440
you can trust me.

610
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,404
Who said I didn't trust you?

611
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:49,488
But what do I do?

612
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:52,199
I don't think I can pick up
during the day.

613
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:54,118
PROSECUTOR GYE JI-UNG

614
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:07,089
Hello?

615
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:16,182
Did something happen?

616
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:17,099
Well…

617
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:19,685
So the thing is…

618
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:21,395
Well…

619
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:24,190
Did you get home safely?

620
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:27,359
Only call if it's important.

621
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:29,570
I had something to say too.

622
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:31,906
What is it? Tell me.

623
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:34,950
I'll trust you.

624
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:40,706
I'll trust you, so keep your promise.

625
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:43,000
Okay.

626
00:41:57,806 --> 00:41:59,225
Damn it!

627
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:08,317
-Do you have that too?
-What?

628
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,902
A GPS tracker.

629
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:12,738
To track openly? Or secretly?

630
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:14,865
Something that won't get me caught.

631
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:15,783
Is it possible?

632
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:17,034
INSTALLING

633
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:26,794
Today was so much fun. My goodness.

634
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,463
Right. Today, Ga-yeong had to…

635
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:31,549
What happened with the cat?

636
00:42:37,471 --> 00:42:39,598
Hey, Ga-yeong. Did you find the cat?

637
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:40,849
MISSING CAT
REWARD 300,000 WON

638
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:44,019
I went to all the shelters,
but there weren't any similar cats.

639
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:45,604
Right?

640
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:47,898
Gosh, you did great. Thanks a lot.

641
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:50,067
I'll treat you once I get paid.

642
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,902
You're working. It can't be helped.

643
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:54,989
I should work hard
for my suddenly old friend.

644
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:57,241
By the way, are you doing well at work?

645
00:42:57,324 --> 00:42:59,368
What? Are you worried the work's bad?

646
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:01,161
It's not the work that worries me.

647
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,497
You've had tons of part-time jobs before.

648
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:06,584
But this is a little different.

649
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:08,544
An office aide? A special position, right?

650
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:09,670
Yeah, so that's why

651
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:12,214
I think it's more fun.

652
00:43:14,216 --> 00:43:15,050
It's fun?

653
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:20,014
Yeah. You know I've seen procedural dramas
from all around the world.

654
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:20,931
Hey.

655
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:23,726
TV shows aren't the same as real life.

656
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:25,894
It's more fun because it's real.

657
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:28,772
But the thing is

658
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:30,774
I think…

659
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:34,445
I've found what I'm good at.

660
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:40,701
Is that prosecutor good to you though?

661
00:43:41,368 --> 00:43:42,661
Well…

662
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:45,623
I mean,

663
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:47,750
I'll tell you later in person.

664
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:49,668
I have some stuff to tell you.

665
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:51,128
Mi-jin, come and eat!

666
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:52,755
Coming!

667
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:54,214
Hey, Ga-yeong,

668
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:56,342
send me the cat video when you're done.

669
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:58,052
Okay, bye!

670
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:06,060
It's not like she can keep working
like this. What will she do then?

671
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:09,521
Still, it's a relief to hear
she's having fun.

672
00:44:10,856 --> 00:44:12,941
She won't end up getting fired, will she?

673
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:15,611
Thanks for the meal.

674
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:19,448
That's nice.

675
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:20,866
-Soup's good, right?
-Yeah.

676
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:25,037
What's up, Mi-jin?

677
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:27,414
You look happy about something.

678
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:30,959
-Yeah.
-What is it?

679
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:34,922
I have a job.

680
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:39,426
Honey, get some water
for our employed daughter.

681
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,428
-Yes, ma'am!
-Dad, it's okay.

682
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:43,639
Eat up.

683
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:45,974
-No, you eat it.
-You can have all of it.

684
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:47,976
What's with you? Just eat it, Mom.

685
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,061
Here you go, ma'am!

686
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:51,397
Thanks, Dad.

687
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:54,358
Thank you, Dad.

688
00:44:56,693 --> 00:44:57,945
This is really good, Mom.

689
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:09,039
Are you okay?

690
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:12,418
I mean, you saw
how much she loves to work.

691
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:14,294
Imagine how hard it must've been for her.

692
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:19,091
It's not that she didn't work.
She just never had the chance to.

693
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:22,970
Thank goodness she's working now.

694
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:41,989
This picture came out well.

695
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:46,034
This tasted so good.

696
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:54,042
Even if you're going to gamble,
don't skip your meals.

697
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:57,629
Where were we?

698
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:00,466
The homeless.

699
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:02,050
You won't find anything from them.

700
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:04,761
People don't use them
to open accounts now?

701
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:06,555
It's too complicated.

702
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:09,433
You get prescriptions for drug patches
and sell them for money.

703
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:12,227
You think homeless people
still have health insurance?

704
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:17,065
Our way's cleaner
in terms of processing transactions.

705
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:21,737
There's no kimchi?

706
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:24,531
Could we have more kimchi, please?

707
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:25,491
All right!

708
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:31,330
We're different from those drug addicts.

709
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:34,124
Drugs or gambling, it's all the same.

710
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:35,375
Damn it!

711
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:37,794
Gambling only ruins individuals.

712
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:40,756
But drugs ruin everyone around you too.

713
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:41,840
People go down with you.

714
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:43,509
Is that why you made your wife

715
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:46,803
with terminal cancer
get you a prescription for drugs to sell

716
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:47,804
so you could gamble?

717
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:49,890
I told you it was just one time!

718
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:50,933
Why?

719
00:46:52,017 --> 00:46:53,143
The insurance ran out.

720
00:46:57,189 --> 00:46:58,690
Can I get another bottle of soju?

721
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:00,609
Just eat your food now, will you?

722
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:09,076
Fentanyl.

723
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:12,204
I know people
who distribute it professionally.

724
00:47:12,287 --> 00:47:14,414
-Another bottle of soju, please.
-Okay.

725
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:17,000
This right here.

726
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:19,044
It's a pretty big business.

727
00:47:19,127 --> 00:47:21,630
You know gambling dens
are in decline these days.

728
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:23,423
They start doing it as a side job,

729
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:25,467
and then, they make it their main work.

730
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:26,969
That says it all.

731
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:29,096
If that's the case,

732
00:47:29,888 --> 00:47:31,682
where can I go to meet them?

733
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:37,521
All I've had was soup.

734
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:38,438
I feel so weak.

735
00:47:39,147 --> 00:47:40,399
Maybe if I had some meat,

736
00:47:40,482 --> 00:47:42,734
I'd have the strength to tell you.

737
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:47,155
Could we get a plate of boiled pork too?

738
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:48,073
Okay.

739
00:47:48,156 --> 00:47:48,991
A small plate.

740
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:51,451
SEOHAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

741
00:47:53,161 --> 00:47:55,122
All the fentanyl in Seohan's from here.

742
00:47:58,417 --> 00:47:59,626
Let's go today.

743
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:00,544
Let's go.

744
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:03,672
I'd like to go too.

745
00:48:03,755 --> 00:48:05,591
No, that's fine.

746
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,217
Don't overdo it.

747
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:09,428
I can go in disguise or sneak in.

748
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:11,054
Let me back you up.

749
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:20,105
I'll take this chance to make sure
and show you that you need me.

750
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:24,568
When does Club Hovan open?

751
00:48:25,193 --> 00:48:27,613
I guess you didn't know,
but clubs open late.

752
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:29,323
It gets crowded after midnight.

753
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:31,783
No, ordinary clubs are like that,

754
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:35,078
but Club Hovan opens pretty early.

755
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:39,082
So during the week, they open at 7:00 p.m.
for people getting off work.

756
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:40,000
Yeah.

757
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:42,044
Have you already surveyed the location?

758
00:48:42,127 --> 00:48:45,130
I've been going for years,
so it's basic knowledge…

759
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:50,469
It's basic knowledge to scout in advance.

760
00:48:50,552 --> 00:48:51,970
Yes, of course.

761
00:48:52,054 --> 00:48:54,014
But people go to clubs at that hour?

762
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:58,393
Gosh, Club Hovan lets people in
for free only from 7:00 to 9:00 p.m.

763
00:48:58,477 --> 00:49:00,771
On some days,
before doors open and until late at night,

764
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:02,814
the line stretches all the way out.

765
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:03,732
It's no joke.

766
00:49:03,815 --> 00:49:07,069
It's the hottest club
for young people to go to in this town.

767
00:49:15,744 --> 00:49:17,663
You know a lot about clubs in Seohan.

768
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:22,334
My niece goes there often.

769
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:24,586
She's a clubber.

770
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:33,428
If they open at 7:00 p.m.,
let's wrap up and go.

771
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:37,057
On the way there,
could I drop by somewhere?

772
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:39,226
I'll meet you
in front of the club at 7:00 p.m.

773
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:40,185
What for?

774
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:41,978
We're going out to war,

775
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:44,314
so we need to prepare for combat.

776
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:53,699
Turn me into a trendy clubber.

777
00:49:53,782 --> 00:49:55,117
Not the disco, but a club?

778
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,243
Damn it.

779
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:59,037
Make me shiny and sparkly.

780
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:01,039
I need to be hot and pretty.

781
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:03,500
-Okay.
-They're all dead meat.

782
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:06,294
I wonder whose funeral it's going to be.

783
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,049
-Looking like you're in your twenties?
-Yeah.

784
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:14,928
-I'm not done yet.
-I'm embarrassed.

785
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:25,856
Open your eyes.

786
00:50:36,491 --> 00:50:38,702
I'll go. I have the best chance to get in.

787
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:12,903
I let you come
since you insisted on this.

788
00:51:12,986 --> 00:51:14,446
Don't worry.

789
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:16,323
I'll make sure you have back up.

790
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:18,658
The art of undercover investigation.

791
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:21,495
I'll show you what that is.

792
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:24,039
Report every ten minutes once you get in.

793
00:51:24,122 --> 00:51:25,874
I'm going in if there's no word.

794
00:51:25,957 --> 00:51:26,958
Ms. Lim?

795
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:29,920
Don't feel hurt if you can't get in.

796
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:32,714
This place has high standards.

797
00:51:35,467 --> 00:51:36,510
Don't worry.

798
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:48,063
Is this the right thing to do?

799
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:53,068
SEOHAN CITY SUNSET TIME

800
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:56,696
I just need to hold on for three minutes.

801
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:57,697
Three minutes.

802
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:02,661
Look and kick out the rejects.

803
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:13,797
Excuse me?

804
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:17,968
Ma'am?

805
00:52:19,052 --> 00:52:20,804
Excuse me? Hey, lady.

806
00:52:21,763 --> 00:52:22,597
Auntie?

807
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:23,515
What's going on?

808
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:25,892
Excuse me?

809
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:27,394
Don't pretend not to hear.

810
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:28,478
Come on.

811
00:52:28,937 --> 00:52:29,938
Take the sunglasses off.

812
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:33,024
Just come out. Now.

813
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:34,985
Damn it.

814
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:36,403
Me? What is it?

815
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:38,196
Your kid's not here. Go somewhere else.

816
00:52:39,447 --> 00:52:42,576
-Sweetie.
-"Sweetie"? Come on.

817
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:43,910
You hurt my feelings.

818
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:45,036
I'm not an old lady.

819
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:47,956
You obviously are. Don't be ridiculous.

820
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:49,749
I'm here to party with my friends.

821
00:52:50,166 --> 00:52:51,960
Are you here to grocery shop?

822
00:52:52,043 --> 00:52:53,378
-Excuse me?
-Are you?

823
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:55,255
They're young enough to be your nephews.

824
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:57,007
Jeez. I was born in 1996.

825
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:59,050
-Lady.
-I'm not a lady!

826
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:00,218
Are you kidding me, lady?

827
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:02,095
I was born in 1996!

828
00:53:02,178 --> 00:53:03,263
More like 1969!

829
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:05,015
You want to see my ID?

830
00:53:05,098 --> 00:53:06,391
-Poppy!
-Yes, boss?

831
00:53:06,474 --> 00:53:07,809
-Should I dance?
-Take her out.

832
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:09,477
-Yes, sir.
-I was born in 1996.

833
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:11,021
This way. Come on!

834
00:53:12,939 --> 00:53:14,357
Move it!

835
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:17,611
Now's the time!

836
00:53:24,492 --> 00:53:26,202
Why did you push me?

837
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:27,162
This lady again?

838
00:53:27,245 --> 00:53:28,872
You want me to call the cops?

839
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:31,333
Aren't you the one born in 1969?

840
00:53:31,416 --> 00:53:32,542
I'm sorry, miss.

841
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:35,128
-Hey!
-Yes, boss?

842
00:53:35,211 --> 00:53:37,464
Come on. Show this young woman inside.

843
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:38,840
-Yes, boss!
-Hurry up!

844
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:40,884
Right this way!

845
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:43,094
What? How did she get in?

846
00:53:43,178 --> 00:53:45,722
We'll do our best to serve you.

847
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:51,978
Hey!

848
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:53,939
-Who are you, mister?
-Let go.

849
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:56,608
I came for fun! What's with you?
See? I'm a regular.

850
00:53:56,691 --> 00:53:57,525
Come on!

851
00:53:57,609 --> 00:53:59,861
Look at me! Look how cool I am!

852
00:54:00,779 --> 00:54:01,863
Wow, seriously?

853
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:04,574
Why can they go in and I can't?

854
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:07,035
Why? I'm wearing a leather jacket!

855
00:54:08,453 --> 00:54:10,455
Why can't I go in?

856
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:23,635
Jeez.

857
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:29,683
I'll wait in the back.

858
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:31,184
Just go home.

859
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:53,873
I'm in.

860
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:56,126
I'll be waiting outside.

861
00:54:56,209 --> 00:54:57,836
Call me if something happens.

862
00:54:57,919 --> 00:54:59,087
It's every ten minutes.

863
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:00,839
I'm going in if you don't call.

864
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:11,433
I would've gone in
if we weren't undercover.

865
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:40,211
I should be getting approached by now.

866
00:56:20,293 --> 00:56:21,878
They do deals in the rooms.

867
00:56:21,961 --> 00:56:23,213
From what we know,

868
00:56:23,296 --> 00:56:26,508
this area with clubs, bars,
cabarets, and other establishments

869
00:56:26,591 --> 00:56:28,301
are managed by the Bald Head Gang.

870
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:31,763
Let's be serious.

871
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:33,264
I'm sorry.

872
00:56:34,015 --> 00:56:35,892
The Bald Head Gang manages them,

873
00:56:35,975 --> 00:56:39,187
but they wouldn't openly deal drugs
no matter how bold they were.

874
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:41,481
They'll do deals in rooms for VIPs.

875
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:45,193
In other words, we need evidence
of deals being done in the rooms.

876
00:56:45,276 --> 00:56:46,152
That's right.

877
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:52,242
Should I see if we can disguise her
as kitchen staff?

878
00:56:53,034 --> 00:56:55,286
It's not a restaurant.
Why would they go in a room?

879
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:56,329
So…

880
00:56:57,038 --> 00:56:59,040
I just have to get into the VIP room?

881
00:57:18,393 --> 00:57:19,227
Wait a second.

882
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:29,529
I'm entering the VIP room.

883
00:57:30,196 --> 00:57:31,531
The VIP room?

884
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:34,576
There's a cabaret near here too.

885
00:57:34,659 --> 00:57:36,661
Did you go into the wrong place?

886
00:57:36,744 --> 00:57:38,580
-Are you in Club Hovan?
-Let's go in.

887
00:57:47,672 --> 00:57:48,923
-Holy cow!
-What?

888
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:49,841
She's killer!

889
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:51,468
Killer?

890
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:53,928
What's killer?

891
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:56,639
Over here!

892
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:01,436
These are drugs?

893
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:03,313
These are fentanyl patches.

894
00:58:03,396 --> 00:58:06,483
They're supposed to be for patients
to alleviate their pain.

895
00:58:06,566 --> 00:58:09,444
But drug addicts
illegally obtain and abuse them.

896
00:58:09,527 --> 00:58:11,529
So I just have to find these shapes?

897
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:12,572
NUMBER 3

898
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:14,449
This way! Take a seat.

899
00:58:15,366 --> 00:58:17,243
-You too.
-Come here. Sit down.

900
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:20,163
You're loving this too much.

901
00:58:20,246 --> 00:58:22,749
Why are you so far away? Come here.

902
00:58:23,374 --> 00:58:24,542
Want to take this?

903
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:26,085
It's great.

904
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:27,170
Your mind goes numb.

905
00:58:27,253 --> 00:58:29,130
-Come on.
-I said it's not.

906
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:30,298
-What are you doing?
-Drink.

907
00:58:30,381 --> 00:58:32,634
You looked hot.
Doesn't your shoulder hurt?

908
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:34,802
I'm fine.

909
00:58:36,095 --> 00:58:37,013
But my wrist…

910
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:41,267
Your wrist hurts?

911
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:43,269
You should do this then.

912
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:44,437
What are you doing?

913
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:46,231
You said your wrist hurt.

914
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:48,942
It'll feel much better
if you massage it like this.

915
00:58:57,158 --> 00:58:58,660
What the hell?

916
00:59:00,828 --> 00:59:02,288
Why hasn't she reported in?

917
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:04,541
It's been almost ten minutes.

918
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:08,795
Ms. Lim?

919
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:09,963
Mr. Ju?

920
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:12,215
What's going on?

921
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:23,518
I'm here to check something.

922
00:59:23,601 --> 00:59:24,435
PUBLIC SERVANT

923
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:25,478
Hello, Mr. Gye.

924
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:28,273
Is that what you expected, punk?

925
00:59:28,356 --> 00:59:29,983
What do you take us for?

926
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:31,526
Posing as a prosecutor?

927
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:35,613
What do you take us for, you punk? Well?

928
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,533
You started this.

929
00:59:38,616 --> 00:59:39,492
You little punk.

930
00:59:47,792 --> 00:59:49,168
Get that punk going in now!

931
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:50,753
He's crazy! Just stop him!

932
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:24,245
Hey, that crazy bastard
is going up right now!

933
01:00:25,997 --> 01:00:27,332
Damn it!

934
01:00:27,415 --> 01:00:29,167
What were you doing? Damn it.

935
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:31,336
-Yes, boss.
-What is it?

936
01:00:31,419 --> 01:00:32,629
Let's go. Run!

937
01:00:33,671 --> 01:00:34,547
What's going on?

938
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:43,431
What the hell are you doing?

939
01:00:43,514 --> 01:00:45,308
You touched my stomach!

940
01:00:45,391 --> 01:00:46,392
-You little…
-Do-gyeong.

941
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:48,353
Your face is red, man!

942
01:00:48,436 --> 01:00:49,437
Shut your mouth.

943
01:00:51,856 --> 01:00:53,358
-What's this?
-My purse.

944
01:00:53,441 --> 01:00:54,317
Give it to me.

945
01:01:00,865 --> 01:01:02,283
I can't believe this bitch.

946
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:17,840
Did you hit me with a bottle?

947
01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:19,384
This is self-defense now.

948
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:44,492
Wait. Let me borrow this.

949
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:45,618
What?

950
01:02:06,764 --> 01:02:08,474
You dare play tricks, you bitch?

951
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:15,356
Ms. Lim!

952
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:19,444
Ms. Lim!

953
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:28,953
Let's shoot a real video.

954
01:02:29,036 --> 01:02:29,954
-Let's do it.
-Hey!

955
01:02:30,037 --> 01:02:31,289
Hey!

956
01:02:31,372 --> 01:02:32,832
-What's with you?
-Stop it!

957
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:35,418
I'm feeling high right now,
so why should I stop?

958
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:21,839
MISS NIGHT AND DAY

959
01:03:22,924 --> 01:03:25,259
Ko Won wasn't the target
for the acid, was he?

960
01:03:26,886 --> 01:03:27,720
Ms. Lee Mi-jin?

961
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:29,222
You don't care about others.

962
01:03:30,556 --> 01:03:32,725
But technically, you're not just anyone.

963
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:36,896
Everything you say is so typical,
but it's nice.

964
01:03:38,356 --> 01:03:41,234
Before I expose
why you tried to kill that person,

965
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:42,610
handle it now.

966
01:03:42,693 --> 01:03:44,946
This is why I don't like
working with people

967
01:03:45,029 --> 01:03:47,073
who are old, inexperienced, and chatty.

968
01:03:47,156 --> 01:03:49,075
You're selfish.

969
01:03:49,158 --> 01:03:51,118
You're mean too.

970
01:03:54,413 --> 01:03:59,043
