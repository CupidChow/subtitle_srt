1
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:45,962
MISS NIGHT AND DAY

2
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:07,400
Well…

3
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:10,987
What happens if someone was
temporarily insane due to alcohol?

4
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:12,572
What?

5
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:15,909
Well, sentence reduction

6
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:18,203
will depend on if the incident
was an accident or not.

7
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,121
I see.

8
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:23,249
Why?

9
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:26,961
Then, this isn't an accident.

10
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:28,505
What isn't an accident?

11
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:51,778
What's this…

12
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:54,656
doing here?

13
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,701
-Damn it.
-Wait.

14
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,580
I'm going to go home.

15
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,541
I should go.

16
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:07,377
I thought you were going to
headbutt me again.

17
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,878
The place is a mess as well.

18
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:10,213
Wait…

19
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,006
It's like PTSD.

20
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:15,051
Damn it.

21
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,434
My gosh!

22
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,146
I don't believe it! This is crazy!

23
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:28,731
Goodness.

24
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:32,610
Hey, they're kissing! My gosh!

25
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:35,029
On the lips! Kiss her!

26
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:35,989
They're kissing!

27
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:37,782
I can't believe… My goodness!

28
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:41,786
What's it to you if they make out or not?
Be quiet so I can sleep!

29
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,873
-I can't even live vicariously?
-No, you can't.

30
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:46,499
Wait.

31
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,501
Hey, wait.

32
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:50,211
Did something happen?

33
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:51,838
-Tell me what happened.
-No.

34
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:52,922
Nothing happened.

35
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:56,009
Why are you blushing
and hiding under the blankets?

36
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:58,303
-Me? No way.
-Something did happen.

37
00:02:58,386 --> 00:02:59,846
-I know you. Tell me.
-What?

38
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:01,514
-Nothing happened.
-Yes, it did.

39
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,599
-Don't!
-I know you.

40
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:03,683
I know you.

41
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:06,185
What is it?

42
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:08,146
Well…

43
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:09,230
Yeah?

44
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:13,985
-It's just…
-Yeah?

45
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,112
Well…

46
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:17,030
Have you…

47
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:18,990
ever kissed before?

48
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:21,784
Yeah, I have.

49
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:22,911
Yeah, okay.

50
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,204
-With a palm?
-What?

51
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:26,289
With a palm.

52
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:28,082
What?

53
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,335
-With a palm.
-What?

54
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:32,003
-With a palm.
-With a palm?

55
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:32,921
-Yeah.
-Why?

56
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:33,922
Good question.

57
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:37,508
What the hell?

58
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:41,262
Did Mr. Gye try to kiss you?

59
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,513
And you blocked him?

60
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:44,933
That's crazy! I don't believe it!

61
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,351
-He blocked me.
-What?

62
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:48,728
-He blocked me.
-He did? Why?

63
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:51,231
He blocked you?

64
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,150
Wait, he blocked you?

65
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:01,950
My goodness!

66
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,993
He blocked you! How embarrassing!

67
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,497
That's so damn embarrassing!

68
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,873
He blocked you!

69
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:12,252
I have to see him at work tomorrow.
What do I do?

70
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:13,962
I can't face him. I'm too embarrassed.

71
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:16,631
You're such a hot mess
when you drink, Mi-jin.

72
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:17,924
You take the cake.

73
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:20,385
Seriously, what do I do?

74
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:23,304
Wait, that means… Don't tell me you…

75
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:27,433
When I asked you to buy food for me,
were you downstairs at his place?

76
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,894
I'm going to kill you.

77
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,729
I was hungry my hands were shaking.

78
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,321
What in the world?

79
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:21,821
Do you have any Sangiovese?

80
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:23,698
Or any other vintage wines?

81
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:25,199
That's all we have there.

82
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,118
Okay.

83
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,624
-Lee Mi-jin.
-Welcome.

84
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:34,667
Are you buying?

85
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,210
-Be quiet.
-Are you buying?

86
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:37,795
-I'll buy.
-Nice!

87
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,881
Still, don't grab too much stuff. Okay?

88
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:41,758
Come on. You said you'd buy.

89
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,468
Can I buy this too?

90
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:45,219
Get whatever you want.

91
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:48,973
Wait. Why am I hiding?

92
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,605
I need something to drink.

93
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:59,108
-Just beer won't cut it tonight.
-You're crazy.

94
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,109
-Hey.
-What?

95
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,444
To get drunk and mess up again?

96
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:02,779
-Don't stop me.
-That's enough.

97
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,322
-Stop it.
-That's enough.

98
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:06,949
-I said let go. Don't stop me.
-That's enough!

99
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:09,869
Let go!

100
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:19,462
Crap. Did it hit someone?

101
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,214
Why did you stop me?

102
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,821
I'm sorry.

103
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:49,117
What is it?

104
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,670
By any chance…

105
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:03,798
-Is that…
-Yes, I was going to give it to you.

106
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:14,934
-Hello.
-Hello.

107
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,523
You found it.

108
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,525
-There it is.
-Yeah, it was here.

109
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:32,577
Yes.

110
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,828
I mean, no. Keep the receipt.

111
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:40,710
You said you didn't drink,
but I see you're already restocking.

112
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:43,796
I drink a little from time to time
when I'm tired or upset.

113
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:45,590
I was out anyway.

114
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:48,426
I see. You were upset.

115
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:50,219
No.

116
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,555
-That's not what I meant.
-I made a mistake…

117
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,517
I'm sorry.

118
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,480
I didn't mean
to cause you so much trouble.

119
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,400
No, I'm sorry.

120
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:08,863
Sorry about what?

121
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:10,531
What?

122
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:15,536
-I mean…
-I suddenly want spicy pig's trotters!

123
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,664
I'd better buy some
on my way home then, right?

124
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,877
So you two don't have to worry about me.

125
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,378
Just have a nice talk and…

126
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,422
What? Hey, where are you going?

127
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,177
Have a good night.

128
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,720
Hey, Mi-jin!

129
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,539
Sorry about what?

130
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,098
Why is this all crumpled?

131
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:25,398
It's the autopsy report
for Baek Cheol-gyu's wife.

132
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:27,149
They found fentanyl in her blood.

133
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:30,695
He had easy access to drugs,
so he became the prime suspect.

134
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:33,823
That's when they discovered
his wife's affair.

135
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,283
He was suspected even more.

136
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:37,618
There was speculation
but no hard evidence.

137
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,120
His alibi was also solid.

138
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:42,123
And they couldn't ignore
his respected status in the community.

Kang Gyeong-hui's hand was severed.

141
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,991
The current victim's foot was severed.

142
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:22,038
Both had fentanyl in their blood.

143
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:27,209
I asked forensics for the photos

144
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:31,255
of the recently found severed foot
and Kang Gyeong-hui's severed wrist.

145
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,465
What were the results?

146
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:34,759
They appear to be the same.

147
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,178
If the victim had died,

148
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,014
why would the culprit reappear now

149
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:41,432
well after 20 years?

150
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:43,809
Why would he have been so cruel?

151
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:48,689
Because it wasn't planned.

152
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:57,782
There was a murder,
but if it was an accident

153
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,742
and they couldn't get rid
of the body parts…

155
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:08,626
They could've hidden the body nearby.

156
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:12,546
I'm sure the surrounding areas
were searched thoroughly.

157
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,402

Hello, Mr. Gye.

160
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,045
I'm sorry for calling so late.

161
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,339
During your search
after you found that body part,

162
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,799
did you check the reservoir too?

163
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:59,427
Yes, we took a boat out
and searched the whole area.

164
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,928
We sent in divers too.

165
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:02,430
You didn't find anything?

166
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:05,141
That reservoir is very deep.

167
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,809
There was bad visibility.

168
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,103
We didn't really find much.

169
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:10,396

Good morning.

174
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:48,684
You two look rough.

175
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,102
-No, I don't.
-No, I don't.

176
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:53,772
Did something happen with you two?

177
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:56,025
No, nothing happened.

Seriously?

181
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,044
Why is this thing acting up?

182
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,762
I guess it was out of staples.

DAEHO RESERVOIR
DAEHO-RI

184
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:29,517
Ms. Lim?

185
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,684
What?

186
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:35,397
Well…

187
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,441
If it's not urgent,

188
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,568
please tell me later.

189
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:42,821
Well, it's not urgent.

190
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,532
But you know the area of Daeho-ri well.

191
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:45,908
-Could you--
-No, I don't.

192
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:47,868
You said you were from there.

193
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:51,247
So that means I must know
its geography too?

194
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:54,833
Well, no.

195
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,044
Then, after work--

196
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:59,463
You still don't know
I don't work overtime?

197
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:01,632
I do.

198
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:06,679
And from now on, I refuse
to work overtime or do special tasks.

199
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:07,680
Bear that in mind.

200
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:12,351
Jeez.

201
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,607
What did you do wrong?

202
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,360
Good question. What did I do?

203
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,028
What's with her?

204
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:31,287
By the way, is Ms. Lim married?

205
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:33,414
I don't know.

206
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:35,416
-Why?
-I'm just wondering.

207
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:37,543
It seems she's always busy at night.

208
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,461
It's no big deal,

209
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,922
but it feels like she tries hard
to avoid me at night.

210
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:45,050
I don't know. I thought it was
because her body couldn't keep up,

211
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:48,095
but she helped us
get into the club that time even at night.

212
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:51,390
Right, she did have to leave
due to sudden chest pains.

213
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,601
You know, she never works overtime.

214
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:54,894
Is something going on?

215
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:57,897
There are no issues with her work,
so it doesn't matter.

216
00:14:58,439 --> 00:14:59,648
But still, it's strange.

217
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:02,484
Hey.

218
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,653
Sit across from me.

219
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,238
Everyone can see.

220
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,032
Who cares? This is a seat too.

221
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:09,825
-Damn it.
-We're just eating. So what?

222
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,412
I said I'd buy.

223
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:14,580
Why the cafeteria?

224
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,957
We can go out and eat something good.

225
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:20,210
I have to eat quickly and work
if I want to finish on time.

226
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:23,005
And I told you to use honorifics here.

227
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:28,177
But we're around the same age.

228
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,263
This is driving me nuts.
I'm going to kill you.

229
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:36,185
Come on.

230
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:37,811
Seriously?

231
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,480
Stop.

232
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:40,564
Try it.

233
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:43,609
You ate it anyway.

234
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:46,362
Drink some water.

235
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,246
Stop it.

236
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,457
-Just a second.
-No. Stop.

237
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,377
-Stop it.
-Let me just get it.

238
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,836
No, I said it's fine.

239
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,313
Jeez.

240
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:25,818
What are you doing? I'm eating!

241
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:27,903
Wow, it's so good!

242
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,279
Then, why are you angry?

243
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:30,364
You're so weird.

244
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:52,696
THERE'S A SENIOR INTERN
WHO LIED ABOUT THEIR IDENTITY

245
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,701
Yes?

246
00:17:58,535 --> 00:17:59,953
Have you eaten yet?

247
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:02,414
Yes, I have.

248
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,752
Thank you so much.

249
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:08,212
Would you like me to help?

250
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,005
No, it's fine.

251
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,549
I can do it. It's okay.

252
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:16,345
Thank you.

253
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:28,232
THERE'S A SENIOR INTERN
WHO LIED ABOUT THEIR IDENTITY

254
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:08,397
JINPYEONG-EUP
DAEHO RESERVOIR, DAEHO-RI

255
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,389
Hello, Detective Kwon?

256
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:44,641
I'm sorry, but can I ask you for a favor?

257
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:47,853
Mr. Gye!

258
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:53,358
Did you ask the police to redo
the search for the missing person?

259
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,611
-Yes.
-Who do you think you are?

260
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:56,862
Who are you to do that?

261
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:59,573
I was told vision was obstructed,
so the search went poorly.

262
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:03,785
I'm asking why you're making this fuss
when it's not even your case!

263
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,329
If the victim is dead,

264
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:07,289
the body will be in the vicinity.

265
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:08,916
Fine, let's say it's there.

266
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,918
They'd search again
if they can't find it,

267
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,544
or Ms. Tak would take care of it!

268
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,671
So why are you getting involved? Why?

269
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,506
Don't you know the longer
a body's submerged

270
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,133
the more difficult an autopsy will be?

271
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,551
What if it's not there?

272
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,595
That's why I'm asking them
to search again.

273
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:23,013
Are you insane?

274
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:24,056
Don't get involved.

275
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:32,773
Don't mention anything
about missing persons again!

276
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:34,191
Got it?

277
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,340
DETAILS OF MISSING PERSON

278
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:02,010
DAEHO-RI 1.3 KM

279
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,567
I left the convenience store
so you could talk.

280
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:18,902
But you just left!

281
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:21,530
That's when you should've talked it out.

282
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,782
Has he called you at all?

283
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:26,702
He's been really busy
with a case these days.

284
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,161
That's okay.

285
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:30,706
No news is good news. There's still hope.

286
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,250
Forget it. There's no hope left.

287
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,419
Mi-jin, if you two are destined to meet,

288
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:37,587
then you're bound to meet somehow.

289
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:39,840
Whatever, I'm going to drink
a bunch tonight

290
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:41,008
and forget everything.

291
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:43,135
Jeez, don't do anything stupid
while drunk again.

292
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:44,469
Excuse me? Hey.

293
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,930
What could I possibly do
at a pig's trotters restaurant?

294
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:49,057
But where are you? I'm here.

295
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:50,809
Go ahead and get in line.

296
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:52,602
You're still not at home, are you?

297
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,604
I'm done editing. I'll be right there.

298
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:56,773
Don't wait inside somewhere
because of the cold.

299
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:58,025
You have to wait in line.

300
00:21:58,108 --> 00:21:59,776
It gets packed at night.

301
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,194
Okay. Just get here.

302
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:02,279
Okay.

303
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:04,906
I knew she'd do this.

304
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,492
Why is this line so long?

305
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:15,876
Ms. Lee Mi-jin?

306
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,213
What are you doing here, Mr. Ju?

307
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:21,840
I'm a regular here.

308
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:23,133
I see.

309
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:24,885
Yes, this place is good.

310
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:26,636
I see you're a regular too.

311
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,597
Yes, my friend and I love this place.

312
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,599
Your friend? But why are you alone?

313
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:32,768
She's running late. She asked me to wait.

314
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:35,604
-Great. You can join us then.
-"Us"?

315
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:36,688
Just a moment.

316
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:39,858
Hello? Where are you?

317
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:43,612
How many times do I have to tell you?
Turn the corner.

318
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:45,197
Yes.

319
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,116
Mr. Gye, I know you'll just drink wine
on an empty stomach.

320
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,787
In times like this, you eat something good
and relieve that stress.

321
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,914
That'll increase your work efficiency.

322
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:56,083
I've been running around in circles here!

323
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,630
What are you doing here?

324
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:04,382
Over here!

325
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:06,093
Come over this way!

326
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,108
What happened?

327
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:23,735
It's not what I wanted.

328
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:28,073
What are you going to do
about this awkward situation?

329
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:30,408
I said this isn't what I wanted.

330
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:35,455
You two must understand
each other with just a glance.

331
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:36,456
-Yes.
-Yes.

332
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:39,126
We grew up together.

333
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:41,044
We're practically sisters.

334
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:42,963
So your families must be close too.

335
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:44,131
-Yes.
-Of course.

336
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:47,050
Mi-jin's parents
are like my second mom and dad.

337
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:48,969
My mom passed away when I was young,

338
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:52,055
so Mi-jin's mom packed
my lunch boxes on field trips,

339
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:54,975
and she sends me kimchi
every year when she makes it.

340
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,144
I see.

341
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:59,020
-Yes.
-That's amazing.

342
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:01,815
I wonder where the food is.

343
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,235
-Help yourself to this.
-Thank you.

344
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:08,530
Here you go.

345
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:09,698
He offered it, so you eat.

346
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,116
No, you eat it.

347
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:12,325
-Stop it.
-No, you.

348
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:13,493
I don't like these.

349
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:15,453
-He gave it, so eat it.
-You eat it.

350
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,042
-I'll pick it up.
-I'm so sorry.

351
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,794
-I'll clean it up.
-No, it's okay.

352
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:24,462
-Hurry up, Mr. Gye.
-I'll do it.

353
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:30,886
Are you okay?

354
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,012
I'm fine.

355
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:33,930
I said I'd do it.

356
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:54,868
-Should we have a drink?
-Sure.

357
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,001
-Do you have a boyfriend?
-No.

358
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,378
I don't plan on having one.

359
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:06,922
I see.

360
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,882
-Still, you must have a type.
-Ko Won.

361
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:11,927
Ko Won?

362
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,762
We'll clean it, so just leave it.

363
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:15,180
We've already cleaned up.

364
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:16,598
Sorry for the mess.

365
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:18,683
Why Ko Won of all people?

366
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:19,643
What do you mean?

367
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:22,479
It's hard for any woman
not to like Ko Won.

368
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:24,397
Do you agree, Mi-jin?

369
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:26,191
-About what?
-Do you like Ko Won?

370
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:27,567
She said all women do.

371
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,444
Do I like Ko Won?

372
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,197
I'd be thankful for someone like him.

373
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,074
But of course, he'd turn me down.

374
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:35,909
Yes, I'm sure.

375
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:39,037
But if he did like you,
would you date him?

376
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:39,955
If he liked me?

377
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:41,039
-There's no chance.
-No.

378
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:42,082
This is so frustrating.

379
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:43,375
What if…

380
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:47,003
What if Ko Won
confesses that he likes you?

381
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:49,464
Why are you asking hypothetical questions?

382
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:50,757
There's no chance of it.

383
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:52,550
I can ask.

384
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,844
Asking "What if" is wrong in itself.

385
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:57,806
Saying that would express
a very rare case!

386
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:01,434
That didn't happen. Why can't you see
it's pointless to assume things

387
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:03,144
and ask such questions?

388
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,145
I have my reasons!

389
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:05,689
It's just for fun!

390
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:08,108
How is this fun? What's fun about it?

391
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:10,527
-Is this fun?
-It's so much fun.

392
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:19,869
Another beer, please!

393
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:24,624
You said you weren't drinking.

394
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:27,335
-I'll call a designated driver.
-Yeah, answer him.

395
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,838
Would you go out with Ko Won if he asked?

396
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:32,757
What's wrong with you?
Why would he ask me out?

397
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,134
It's a hypothetical.

398
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:35,885
Did she not hear me?

399
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:37,178
We ordered a beer here!

400
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:38,096
All right!

401
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:40,765
I'll be generous enough
to let you have him.

402
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:41,766
Tell us the truth.

403
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,977
-Why would you do that?
-No reason.

404
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,563
At the very slightest chance

405
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:49,691
Ko Won said that he liked me…

406
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,905
Your extra-large
spicy pig's trotters and beer.

407
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:57,449
-Thank you!
-Here's the beer.

408
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:58,992
-Thank you.
-Let's eat first.

409
00:26:59,075 --> 00:26:59,909
This looks good.

410
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:01,119
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

411
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:02,662
She stopped mid-sentence…

412
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:04,581
It's so good!

413
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:06,124
That's not important. Look.

414
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:07,375
I don't want it!

415
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:10,879
It's better when you eat it here.

416
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:17,052
-Snap out of it, will you?
-Get it together!

417
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:19,679
You said you'd help
ease my stress, not add to it.

418
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:21,306
If we have one more drink…

419
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:24,309
What are you talking about?
You're totally drunk.

420
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:26,311
Ouch!

421
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:27,854
-Be careful.
-I'm so dizzy.

422
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:30,023
-Jeez.
-Let's rest a bit before we go.

423
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:32,776
I wanted to stay home,
but he just had to drag me out.

424
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,944
Sorry about joining you two.

425
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:37,530
No, that's not what I meant.

426
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:41,993
Mr. Ju was happy to see you earlier.

427
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:45,955
Yeah, it was nice seeing him outside
even though I see him every day.

428
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:48,166
When did we see each other?

429
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:49,751
You see him every day?

430
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:50,794
Where?

431
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:52,837
Well…

432
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:54,005
going here and there,

433
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:57,050
I've seen him around a lot.

434
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:59,344
Then, you should've said hi!

435
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:01,221
Let's get another drink! Excuse me!

436
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:02,764
Table for four right here!

437
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:04,391
-They're closed.
-Four's good!

438
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:07,227
-Hello?
-Get up. They're closed. Leave it.

439
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:09,437
Hey, over here!

440
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:10,438
-They're closed?
-Jeez.

441
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,774
-Let's get one more drink!
-Stop it.

442
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:15,485
-Can you carry me on your back?
-One more!

443
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:24,202
Why is this so tight?

444
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:25,787
It's too tight!

445
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,705
How could she do this to us?

446
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:30,917
I asked for a table for four,
and she didn't open the door.

447
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,210
This can't happen…

448
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:34,462
-Who are you?
-Your designated driver.

449
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,548
Where's Mr. Gye?

450
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:37,841
-In the back.
-I'm here!

451
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:39,467
Gosh, you scared me.

452
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,219
You always do this when you're drunk.

453
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:42,470
I don't feel well.

454
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,139
-Hey!
-I feel nauseous.

455
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:46,349
-Stay on your side.
-I feel so sick.

456
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:48,059
I'm fine. Make yourself comfortable.

457
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:50,353
-Thank you.
-I'm sorry.

458
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:53,314
I said go back to your side.

459
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:57,694
But I still haven't heard your answer.

460
00:28:58,695 --> 00:28:59,529
About what?

461
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:01,364
About what Mr. Ju asked you before.

462
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:06,161
Will you get off me?

463
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:13,209
I think I already answered it though.

464
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:15,795
When?

465
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:19,007
That night.

466
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:23,970
-Then, this isn't an accident.
-What isn't an accident?

467
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:34,689
Mi-jin, about that--

468
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:35,982
We've almost arrived.

469
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:37,275
-Okay.
-Okay.

470
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:39,694
The pho restaurant? We're here?

471
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,825
-I love pho.
-You're a great guy.

472
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:50,914
Careful.

473
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:58,922
-I'll be going now.
-Okay.

474
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:06,387
Take care.

475
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:07,472
You too.

476
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:10,308
By the way…

477
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:13,603
what were you going to say earlier?

478
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:20,235
I'll call you.

479
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:22,362
Okay.

480
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,412
When is he going to call?

481
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,581
-Do you think he'll ask you out?
-My goodness.

482
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:36,251
I knew it.

483
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:38,336
You two were so inseparable.

484
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:42,131
Weren't you drunk?

485
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:45,635
Jeez. Come on.

486
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:47,095
Snap out of it, will you?

487
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:49,806
Get it together!

488
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:54,185
Pull it together.

489
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:56,312
An investigator shouldn't drink so much.

490
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:57,772
Thank you for driving, sir.

491
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,609
Gosh, so nice and warm.

492
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,070
Get up. Not there.

493
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:05,280
Sleep anywhere on the couch.

494
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:07,407
Then, how about we…

495
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,576
have a little pho?

496
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,327
-Okay?
-In your next life.

497
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:14,414
Jeez.

498
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:19,294
I'd like to order a large size.

499
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:22,755
Make it spicy, please.

500
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:24,716
Goodness gracious.

501
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:15,266
Good grief.

502
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:17,977
Look at this.

503
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:20,939
The prosecutor ended up
causing trouble again.

504
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:23,024
-Please stay back.
-What do you mean?

505
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:27,820
Whenever he catches onto something,
he keeps showing up like a hyena.

506
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:30,949
Still, we found the body thanks to him.

507
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:33,159
"Thanks to him"?

508
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:34,953
He's not why we found it, punk!

509
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:37,038
It just happened to surface.

510
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:40,583
Gosh, it's deteriorated a lot.

511
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:42,961
Goodness, is it someone we know?

512
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:44,671
What are you saying?

513
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:46,339
That's enough!

514
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:47,715
Fine, let's wrap it up!

515
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:49,050
Go!

516
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:49,968
Just go.

517
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:50,885
Goodness.

518
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:58,518
-It was caught in the water weeds.
-That makes bodies hard to find.

519
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:03,064
-Hey, watch the line!
-Dad!

520
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:04,732
-Dad!
-Stop her!

521
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,025
-Stop her!
-Dad!

522
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:08,861
-Please, calm down!
-Dad! This can't be!

523
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:10,530
Hey, keep her back.

524
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:12,907
-Please calm down.
-Dad, get up! Let me go!

525
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:15,410
Please calm down. All right.

526
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:16,953
Dad!

527
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:18,997
Dad!

528
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,873
Dad!

529
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:24,043
-Hey, keep her away!
-Wait. Dad!

530
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:28,297
Dad!

531
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:40,309
-Hey, secure the scene inside!
-Mom!

532
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,896
Mom!

533
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,857
What's going on?

534
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:48,901
What happened?

535
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:50,570
It's a body!

536
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:53,072
-Mom!
-My gosh!

537
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:55,199
Mom!

538
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:07,295
Who let the kid in?

539
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:09,297
-Get rid of him now!
-Just go!

540
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,549
-What about my mom?
-Ji-ung, it's not your mom.

541
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:15,053
-She's not your mom! Get him out of here!
-Please find her!

542
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:18,097
-Now!
-She's gone missing too!

543
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:28,149
Goodness.

544
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:30,610
What about my mom?

545
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:33,780
Where is she?

546
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:36,365
Please find my mom.

547
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:38,785
Have you eaten anything?

548
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:42,872
Here.

549
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:45,333
Buy something to eat.

550
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,710
Goodness.

551
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,927
Gosh, it's cold out here!

552
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:58,387
Don't you know you'll catch a cold?

553
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,935
Go home now, okay?

554
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:06,604
I won't leave until you find my mom.

555
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:08,856
It's not that we're not looking for her.

556
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,193
We tried really hard,

557
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:14,904
but we couldn't find her.

558
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:18,908
My mom's alive.

559
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,745
She made me a promise.

560
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:25,790
She said she'd come back.

561
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,001
Okay.

562
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:32,296
I hope

563
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:35,508
that's the case too.

564
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:37,552
She'll be back if she's alive.

565
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:56,779
Dad!

566
00:35:58,614 --> 00:35:59,532
Dad!

567
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:04,287
Dad!

568
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,000
Ms. Lim.

569
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:53,419
-If you have time for dinner--
-No.

570
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:55,129
No, let's have pig's trotters and soju--

571
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,130
-No.
-No?

572
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,049
Then, there's this great crab place.

573
00:36:58,132 --> 00:36:59,008
It's on me.

574
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:00,760
Work's over, so I'll be going.

575
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:02,803
See you tomorrow.

576
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,034
Hey, Sun.

577
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:27,078
-What?
-I'll give you a ride.

578
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:33,584
No, it's rush hour. My bike's faster.

579
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:36,003
And if you overexert yourself
and break a bone?

580
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:37,505
I said it's fine.

581
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,257
It's not fine with me.

582
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,302
Hey, what if people see us?

583
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:45,429
What's so important about that?

584
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,431
Your safety's more important.

585
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,141
-What's with you today?
-Give it.

586
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:51,227
-Let's go.
-What's gotten into you?

587
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:52,186
Let's go.

588
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,854
-Come on.
-Get in.

589
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,564
-Come on, let's go.
-Hey.

590
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:56,524
-Let's go.
-Wait.

591
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:57,692
Come on, let's go.

592
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,568
-Ms. Lim.
-What's with you?

593
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:01,237
See? I knew you'd get in.

594
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:03,155
Watch your head.

595
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:06,117
Don't get in. Please.

596
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,410
Let's put on your belt.

597
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:22,258
-Don't speak informally to me in public.
-Come on.

598
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:57,376
Hey, this isn't the way home.

599
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,253
I haven't bought you some good food yet.

600
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:00,338
Let's have dinner.

601
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:02,673
Why do you do as you please?

602
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,342
Who said I wanted dinner?

603
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,678
I just felt bad about what happened
at the company dinner.

604
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:12,433
If it weren't for him…

605
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:20,441
Are you okay?

606
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:21,609
I said I'd do it.

607
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:29,408
By the way…

608
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:32,828
what were you going to say earlier?

609
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:35,122
I'll call you.

610
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:42,963
Is something wrong?

611
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:47,635
Nothing's wrong at all.
Everything is fine.

612
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:01,482
But please don't do that.

613
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,275
Back there…

614
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:04,860
Damn it.

615
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:07,238
Who called them?

616
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:09,073
Did the prosecutors leak this?

617
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:11,242
I bet they're trying to screw us over.

618
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:14,412
Come on. Mr. Gye wouldn't do that.

619
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:15,913
Yeah, right.

620
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:18,165
He requested a warrant
as soon as he got the case!

621
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:22,044
He's making a damn fuss
searching for the body and the culprit.

622
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,714
This is driving me nuts.

623
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:30,469
-Someone's coming!
-How's the case going?

624
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:33,180
A foot was found last month.
Why was the corpse found now?

625
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:35,808
Did police mishandling
the investigation cause the delay?

626
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:39,562
Is it true the foot was severed
while the victim was alive?

627
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:42,648
If it was a murder,
could there be more victims?

628
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:44,900
What is your position?

629
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:46,444
-Tell us!
-I'm on my way.

630
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:48,070
-Is it true?
-I'll see you at NFS.

631
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:49,780
Did you mishandle the investigation?

632
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:51,282
-Do you admit it?
-Tell us.

633
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:52,992
-Give us a statement.
-Tell us!

634
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:54,577
-A few words, please.
-Come on!

635
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,911
A male body with a missing foot

636
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:58,706
was found in a reservoir in Seohan City.

637
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:02,334
It's been confirmed
the victim was a male in his sixties.

638
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:06,464
Despite finding a severed foot
near the reservoir last month,

639
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:09,550
there are claims that the body
wasn't found for over a month

640
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:12,386
due to police
mishandling the investigation…

641
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:15,764
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE
DIRECTOR CHOI

642
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,061
Hello, Director Choi. It's me.

643
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:23,522
I have something to ask you.

644
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:24,607
Yes.

645
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:26,942
Could I see you for a moment?

646
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:28,736
I understand. Goodbye.

647
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:36,160
BODY WITH MISSING FOOT
FOUND IN RESERVOIR

648
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:37,453
POLICE SUSPECTED OF NEGLIGENCE

649
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:45,419
You said you could do it.

650
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:48,839
You said I could leave it to you.

651
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:52,760
The police searched for days
and couldn't find it.

652
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:54,720
I don't think that's on us.

653
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:55,930
"Us"?

654
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,766
This is on you!

655
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:00,976
Gye found what even the police couldn't!

656
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:03,145
This wasn't even his case!
What were you doing?

657
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:04,855
-Mr. Cha.
-Forget it!

658
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:07,191
Anyways, the case
has gone to Gye. It's final.

659
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:11,904
-Mr. Cha!
-Enough!

660
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:13,531
-Mr. Cha!
-Go away!

661
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:18,494
Gye Ji-ung!

662
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,873
I'm going to kill him.

663
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:25,125
Damn it.

664
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:29,421
Gye Ji-ung!

665
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:37,304
I'm so scared.

666
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:38,556
She's so scary.

667
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:48,148
Mr. Ju, are you okay?

668
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:51,860
I'd already been feeling upset.
Now, it's one thing after another.

669
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:53,904
Are you really okay?

670
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:57,491
The emperor has donkey ears!

671
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:05,666
Saying things that shouldn't be said
is absolutely unacceptable.

672
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:07,585
For your own good,

673
00:43:08,794 --> 00:43:10,087
I absolutely cannot say.

674
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:11,463
I won't!

675
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:12,840
I won't tell you.

676
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:29,607
Wow, I guess Mr. Ju
is seriously stressed out.

677
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:32,276
I should work harder for him.

678
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:33,402
I can't believe it.

679
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:34,987
-My goodness.
-Hello.

680
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:37,239
-How could it happen? Hi.
-Hello. Did you see this?

681
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:39,742
-What is it?
-He was a custodian here named Ko Na-heun.

682
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:40,659
Really?

683
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:44,288
The police mishandled
the investigation. It's terrible.

684
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:51,754
BODY WITH MISSING FOOT
FOUND IN RESERVOIR

685
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:01,847
My dad…

686
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:04,808
He took care of me for over 20 years
with his injured leg.

687
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:07,895
He always made sure
I never ate dinner alone.

688
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,272
He said he wasn't a good enough father,

689
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:11,940
so he couldn't do anything for me.

690
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:15,319
He'd always personally prepare
dinner for me.

691
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:29,958
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

692
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:31,752
-Mr. Gye.
-Hello.

693
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:33,796
I would've called you when it was done.

694
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:36,465
-How much longer for the autopsy?
-We made an urgent request.

695
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:38,384
It'll be over within the hour.

696

SEOHAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

698
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:54,566
Goodness.

699
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:58,904
I'm sure you've all seen
the news about Ko Na-heun.

700
00:44:58,987 --> 00:45:00,823
They're still doing the autopsy.

701
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:03,826
Even if we can't hold
a memorial service right away,

702
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:06,829
let's remember he was a colleague of ours

703
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:08,831
who we shared ups and downs with.

704
00:45:08,914 --> 00:45:10,457
Right?

705
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,626
We only worked together for a few days.

706
00:45:12,709 --> 00:45:14,086
You're so rude.

707
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:15,754
Just listen to yourself!

708
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:19,341
What, am I wrong? It's true.

709
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:23,720
Ko Na-heun's daughter stood outside
and begged for someone to find her dad.

710
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:25,556
Did anyone here try to help?

711
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:27,558
Come on, now.

712
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:30,060
-We were getting to know each other--
-He's dead now.

713
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:31,145
Come on!

714
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:33,313
Is that the only way you can speak?

715
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:35,274
What if you'd died like that?

716
00:45:35,357 --> 00:45:38,777
-Think about your family!
-Did I kill him? Why take it out on me?

717
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:40,863
Just thinking about it is making me mad!

718
00:45:40,946 --> 00:45:43,157
I need some tea. Good grief!

719
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,867
That's enough.

720
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:48,662
Nothing good can come
from us acting this way.

721
00:45:48,745 --> 00:45:50,789
Yeah, he's right. Okay?

722
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:52,040
At times like this,

723
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:55,252
we should keep a low profile
and stay quiet

724
00:45:55,335 --> 00:45:57,546
to avoid any unwanted attention.

725
00:45:57,629 --> 00:46:01,258
Also, let's all chip in some money

726
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:03,719
and provide some condolence money, okay?

727
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:05,596
That's all.

728
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:08,015
I'm in favor.

729
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:10,017
I'll help too.

730
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:12,728
If something happens
to his daughter's health,

731
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:15,022
my hospital will actively support her.

732
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:43,467
Mr. Baek!

733
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:52,893
NUMBER 81D 6438

734
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:00,234
Ms. Lee Mi-jin!

735
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:12,704
Could you look for an SUV registered
in Seohan City with the number 6438?

736
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:15,332
Didn't you say the director

737
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:17,334
of Hwadong Medical Center
works here?

738
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:18,627
Yes, Director Baek Cheol-gyu.

739
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:20,629
How long has he worked here now?

740
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:35,310
The owner of car 6438!

741
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:39,314
The owner of 6438 is Dr. Baek.

742
00:47:42,067 --> 00:47:43,944
Baek Cheol-gyu is car 6438!

743
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:45,612
Ms. Lim, calm down.

744
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:48,615
He's on a list of suspects
and is being investigated.

745
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:49,533
Then…

746
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:52,995
Are you saying the person

747
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:55,330
who killed Ko Na-heun could be Dr. Baek?

748
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:57,040
We're not sure of anything yet.

749
00:47:57,833 --> 00:47:59,835
Of course, Mr. Gye is almost certain.

750
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:05,424
Then, why haven't you caught him yet?

751
00:48:06,883 --> 00:48:09,094
You have to arrest him
and lock him up now!

752
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:11,054
There's no proof yet.

753
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:14,725
Mr. Gye wasn't in charge of the case then.
Building a case has its limits too.

754
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:18,478
What if he kills someone else
in the meantime?

755
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:23,817
Witness… A witness!

756
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:25,819
A witness? Who's the witness?

757
00:48:25,902 --> 00:48:28,697
Well, that's…

758
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:31,074
If that case…

759
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:35,037
The person who saw the culprit.
The witness.

760
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,288
What do we do?

761
00:48:36,371 --> 00:48:38,624
What proof would we need? What evidence?

762
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:39,875
Let's think rationally.

763
00:48:40,792 --> 00:48:42,252
Right here. The two of us.

764
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:45,255
Let's go find the evidence together.
Let's find something.

765
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:46,840
-Okay?
-Ms. Lim!

766
00:48:46,923 --> 00:48:49,176
After the autopsy
and after we get a warrant--

767
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:53,513
Ms. Lim, are you okay?

768
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:55,057
-The thing is--
-Take a seat.

769
00:49:06,151 --> 00:49:07,194
What did you find?

770
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:09,029
The cause of death

771
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:11,573
was asphyxiation
due to the inhalation of water.

772
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:15,952
So he wasn't submerged after death.

773
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:17,621
Are you saying he drowned?

774
00:49:17,704 --> 00:49:19,498
Yes, the victim's organs

775
00:49:19,581 --> 00:49:21,917
contained a large amount
of plankton and sand.

776
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,336
It was inhaled from the water he was in.

777
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:32,511
So his foot was severed
and he was submerged

778
00:49:32,594 --> 00:49:34,179
while he was still alive?

779
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:40,644
What a damn psycho.

780
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:42,562
Did he have any other injuries?

781
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:45,774
There are some scratches on the body.

782
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:49,319
I don't think he got them
from the rocks in the water.

783
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:52,280
He likely got scraped when the culprit
dragged him on the ground.

784
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:53,365
What the hell?

785
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:54,825
You have to be kidding me.

786
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:56,410
Anything else to report?

787
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:59,579
Right. Fentanyl was found in his blood.

788
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:03,041
Even just two milligrams
of fentanyl can be lethal.

789
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:05,919
The amount detected wasn't a lethal dose,

790
00:50:06,002 --> 00:50:07,796
but he was probably unconscious.

791
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:12,884
If the culprit had administered it,

792
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:16,722
it may be someone with specialized skills
who knows how to control dosages.

793
00:50:16,805 --> 00:50:17,806
Probably so.

794
00:50:17,889 --> 00:50:22,978
Also, even though it was a minimal amount,
opium was found as well.

795
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:25,647
Once we get the detailed report,
I'll send it over.

796
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:29,651
-Mr. Gye.
-Yes?

797
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:30,819
I have to go.

798
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:32,362
-Okay, great work.
-Thanks.

799
00:50:33,071 --> 00:50:35,782
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

800
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:41,872
-Hello?
-Mr. Gye.

801
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:45,083
The search and seizure warrant
for Hwadong Medical Center was rejected.

802
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:46,752
What?

803
00:50:51,506 --> 00:50:53,717
-What is it?
-I should ask you. What is this?

804
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,093
Why was the warrant rejected?

805
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:56,762
Am I the one who rejected it?

806
00:50:57,429 --> 00:50:58,972
It deserved to be rejected--

807
00:50:59,055 --> 00:51:02,100
Don't you know Dr. Baek
was a suspect in his wife's death?

808
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:04,519
Come on.

809
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:06,772
Don't you know who he is?

810
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:08,899
I do. He's a prime suspect.

811
00:51:08,982 --> 00:51:10,525
Hey, seriously?

812
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:13,528
Director Baek was cleared
of charges in the past. Remember?

813
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:16,031
Also, there are all sorts
of drugs at a hospital.

814
00:51:16,114 --> 00:51:17,866
Why would fentanyl be a problem?

815
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:20,660
So the thing is,

816
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:25,165
fentanyl was found in his wife's body
and in Ko Na-heun's body.

817
00:51:26,082 --> 00:51:27,876
You are being so uptight.

818
00:51:27,959 --> 00:51:31,254
Do you have proof the fentanyl
came from Hwadong Medical Center?

819
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:33,632
That's why I need a search warrant.

820
00:51:33,715 --> 00:51:36,384
For goodness' sake!
Why come to me and complain?

821
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:38,094
Take it up with the judge!

822
00:51:43,016 --> 00:51:44,810
Let's dig into Baek Cheol-gyu.

823
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:50,065
What is it? What's wrong?

824
00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:53,735
Mr. Gye has
three different warning levels.

825
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:54,945
What are they?

826
00:51:55,028 --> 00:51:56,988
He gets immersed in work
and becomes a jerk.

827
00:51:57,072 --> 00:51:59,241
Ignorant. Irresponsible.
Lacks common sense.

828
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:00,867
I'll correct that.
Totally thoughtless.

829
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:03,912
What's level two?

830
00:52:03,995 --> 00:52:06,790
He becomes a jerk
and loses his humanity too.

831
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:08,250
Is that all you know?

832
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:09,876
I'm sorry.

833
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,003
This is why I don't like
working with people

834
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:14,047
who are old, inexperienced, and chatty.

835
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:18,301
Then, what about level three?

836
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:20,262
He just goes crazy
and doesn't hold back.

837
00:52:20,345 --> 00:52:21,555
He charges ahead recklessly.

838
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:24,140
Then, what level is at he now?

839
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:26,184
He's probably at level two right now.

840
00:52:30,272 --> 00:52:32,107
We're going to Hwadong Medical Center now.

841
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:36,152
It's level three now.

842
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:41,032
Then, what happens now?

843
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:45,287
My stomach!

844
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:46,746
-Someone help me!
-Honey!

845
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:47,956
-Where do we go?
-Gosh!

846
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:50,834
-Where? My gosh!
-I'm dying! Help me!

847
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:04,723
Let's start.

848
00:53:04,806 --> 00:53:05,640
Okay.

849
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:11,146
I won't miss out this time.

850
00:53:11,229 --> 00:53:13,857
You'll have to trample over me
if you want to go without me.

851
00:53:14,399 --> 00:53:15,525
It's do or die for me.

852
00:53:18,236 --> 00:53:20,155
Why are you suddenly so spirited?

853
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:23,742
-Let's go.
-Seriously?

854
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:26,745
My life's on the line!

855
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:28,246
What do you mean?

856
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:35,629
My… survival.

857
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:40,967
I have to earn my keep to survive.

858
00:53:58,944 --> 00:53:59,819
Let's go.

859
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:12,082
WARD A
A GENERAL WARD

860
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:30,767
Aside from working here, the hospital is
the only other place Baek goes.

861
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:32,560
I'm sure we'll find something there.

862
00:54:33,144 --> 00:54:35,772
We don't have time or the manpower.
It won't be easy.

863
00:54:36,815 --> 00:54:39,484
Mr. Ju, you take
the medicine storage room here.

864
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:41,778
I'll take the basement storage.

865
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:42,737
Yes, sir.

866
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:45,323
Baek likely knows
we requested a search warrant.

867
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:48,702
We must find any potential evidence
before it's hidden.

868
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:51,830
Then… where do I go?

869
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:04,259
EMERGENCY PATIENTS ONLY

870
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:26,781
Ms. Lim Sun?

871
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:29,409
Ms. Lim, where are you going?

872
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:32,579
My goodness.

873
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:34,372
-Are you okay?
-I'm so dizzy.

874
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:36,207
-My stomach hurts.
-Let's go inside.

875
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:38,168
My head and my stomach hurt.

876
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:39,669
You can't come out here.

877
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:41,546
-Let's go inside.
-Okay.

878
00:55:41,629 --> 00:55:44,049
It was just so stuffy in there.

879
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:45,759
We still have to draw blood.

880
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:46,968
Wait, to draw blood…

881
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:48,094
Draw blood?

882
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:50,305
It's a simple test. Let's go in.

883
00:55:50,388 --> 00:55:52,098
No, it's not that simple.

884
00:55:52,724 --> 00:55:55,810
You can't be out here.
Why are you so strong?

885
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:02,317
Lim Sun's at the hospital? Are you sure?

886
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,902
Hold her there no matter what!

887
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:27,383
Make a fist. This will sting a little.

888
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:30,678
I'm really scared of needles though.

889
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:32,889
Can you please do it gently?

890
00:56:37,977 --> 00:56:39,521
I haven't done it yet.

891
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:43,483
What tests do you need to run?

892
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:01,876
-Where's Lim Sun?
-Bed six.

893
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:08,925
What did I say? I told you to watch her!

894
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:10,802
She was just here moments ago.

895
00:57:10,885 --> 00:57:13,304
Find her right now. Call security!

896
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:25,817
FIVE MINUTES EARLIER

897
00:57:41,916 --> 00:57:43,126
What are we going to do?

898
00:57:59,517 --> 00:58:00,852
Hello, this is security.

899
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:04,022
A woman in her fifties?

900
00:58:04,105 --> 00:58:05,648
What does she look like?

901
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:07,775
A mint-colored jacket and a perm.

902
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:10,737
I understand. I'll check right now.

903
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:15,200
A mint-colored jacket and a perm.

904
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:26,294
A mint-colored jacket.

905
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:37,555

DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

907
00:58:54,072 --> 00:58:55,198
You're in the lobby?

908
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:57,992
I'll be right there. Just wait one moment.

909
00:59:17,595 --> 00:59:19,430
What evidence am I looking for?

910
00:59:21,015 --> 00:59:22,892
Damn it, what do I look for?

911
00:59:28,147 --> 00:59:29,190
A DNA test.

912
00:59:37,532 --> 00:59:39,617
SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY

913
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:41,119
It's her! That's her!

914
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:44,664
EMERGENCY ROOM ENTRANCE

915
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:49,168
It is her.

916
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:51,296
The elevators.

917
00:59:51,796 --> 00:59:53,256
And then…

918
00:59:57,969 --> 00:59:58,970
What?

919
01:00:01,014 --> 01:00:04,267
Where did she go?
She was just in the elevator.

920
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:05,351
What's going on?

921
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:07,395
You still haven't found her?

922
01:00:07,478 --> 01:00:08,813
I'm sorry, Director.

923
01:00:08,896 --> 01:00:11,065
There's no footage of her leaving,

924
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:12,483
so I'm sure she's inside.

925
01:00:12,567 --> 01:00:14,569
Find her right now before she leaves!

926
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:16,821
Yes, sir. I'll call you as soon as I do.

927
01:00:30,084 --> 01:00:31,461
Did anyone come in here?

928
01:00:31,544 --> 01:00:33,296
No, sir. No one.

929
01:00:38,259 --> 01:00:42,889
DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

930
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:50,164
Sir!

931
01:01:53,793 --> 01:01:55,753
These are Lim Sun's blood test results.

Lim Sun,

938
01:02:57,356 --> 01:02:58,316
who…

939
01:03:00,401 --> 01:03:01,277
are you?

940
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:43,277
MISS NIGHT AND DAY

941
01:03:44,028 --> 01:03:47,573
Has the time come for us now
to put this to an end?

942
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:49,951
Why would he run a blood test on me?

943
01:03:50,034 --> 01:03:52,370
-That's cold!
-Do you like older women as well?

944
01:03:52,453 --> 01:03:54,580
She's 20 years older, you punk!
You weren't even born!

945
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:57,041
Anyways, I might not be able
to come in tonight.

946
01:03:57,166 --> 01:03:59,710
She started dating late,
and now, she's going hard.

947
01:03:59,794 --> 01:04:00,962
Get it together!

948
01:04:01,045 --> 01:04:02,421
Let's finish the job quick.

949
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:05,550
-I'll head down first.
-My goodness!

950
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:09,387
What's your relationship with Mi-jin?

951
01:04:09,470 --> 01:04:12,348
-I just really like someone.
-I know how that feels.
