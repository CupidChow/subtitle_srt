HWADONG MEDICAL CENTER FLOOR PLAN

4
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:04,981
Aside from working here, the hospital is
the only other place Baek goes.

5
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,900
I'm sure we'll find something there.

6
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:10,653
Mr. Ju, you take
the medicine storage room here.

7
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,655
I'll take the basement storage.

8
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,044

00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,192

PROCUREMENT DEPARTMENT STORAGE

12
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,268
What evidence am I looking for?

13
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,729
Damn it, what do I look for?

14
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:33,027
A DNA test.

15
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,045
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

16
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:15,904
Did anyone come in here?

17
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:17,739
No, sir. No one.

18
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:54,484
RECOVERY ROOM

19
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,157
Yes, I'm on my way.

20
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,075
Okay.

21
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,202
I'll go straight to Ward 2 now.

22
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:05,828
Just wait one moment.

23
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,656
Mr. Ju, where are you?

24
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:57,964
Sir!

25
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,512
These are Lim Sun's blood test results.

26
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,806
Okay. Hurry up and find her.

27
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:33,124
LIM SUN

What in the world?

32
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,514
Lim Sun,

33
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,100
who…

34
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:53,978
are you?

35
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,905
There's too much foot traffic here.

36
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:47,865
He wouldn't hide them
out in the open.

37
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:50,868
Nothing to report
from the medicine storage room.

38
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,136
FENTANYL

39
00:07:12,431 --> 00:07:13,307
What?

40
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,017
Why is there so much?

41
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:35,413
CLINICAL TRIAL DRUGS

42
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:01,898
Ms. Lim.

43
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,445
Ms. Lim.

44
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,418
Ma'am! What are you doing?

45
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:16,764
Mr. Ju! Quickly!

46
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,310
Ma'am!

47
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:23,980
What in the world?

48
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,608
Hello? Security?

49
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:30,194
Some crazy lady
tried to steal my access card!

50
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:35,157
Mr. Gye!

51
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,534
-Get in!
-Let's go!

52
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,411
Where's Ms. Lim?

53
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:39,579
Ms. Lim? Wait.

54
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,414
-Get in!
-Ms. Lim, hurry!

55
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:42,957
-Hurry!
-Get in the front!

56
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:44,625
She's not in yet!

57
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:47,878
Wait a moment! Wait!

58
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:48,796
Hey, lady!

59
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:51,007
Lady, wait!

60
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:54,594
Are you okay?

61
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,012
Yes.

62
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,640
Thank you so much for earlier.

63
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:02,643
-What? Did something happen?
-Yes, something happened.

64
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,478
I might need four weeks to recover.

65
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:05,813
So what happened was--

66
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:07,023
Did you find anything?

67
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,483
Right. This belongs to Director Baek.

68
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:11,861
I took it just in case.

69
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,696
Let's have it tested for drugs.

70
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,281
And you, Mr. Ju?

71
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:19,410
There were many boxes
of fentanyl in the pharmacy.

72
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:20,911
These are all fentanyl.

73
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:26,000
I'll make a NIMS request to the Ministry
of Food and Drug Safety about them.

74
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,793
Did you find anything, Mr. Gye?

75
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:30,254
I found this in the basement storage.

76
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,590
It didn't look like an ordinary drug,
so I brought it.

77
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,926
I'll ask the NFS to analyze this.

78
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,720
These are Lim Sun's blood test results.

79
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,056
Was there anything else?

80
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,308
Yes.

81
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:45,311
There was. I was actually trapped
inside the pharmacy.

82
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:49,273
I was trapped, and who knew I'd have to
use my wits as an investigator?

83
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:52,902
Well, I expected it,
but I hid everywhere and I…

84
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,739
couldn't get caught…

85
00:10:57,573 --> 00:10:59,700
Why would he run a blood test on me?

86
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:01,869
Is he after Aunt Sun?

87
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:03,746
Why Aunt Sun?

88
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:06,165
What does Director Baek Cheol-gyu

89
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:09,001
want with my aunt?

90
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:20,096
SEOHAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

91
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,180
DRESSING ROOM

92
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:44,620
Goodness.

93
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:46,038
Hey, Ms. Na.

94
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:49,792
We couldn't catch a glimpse of you
when you moved to the prosecutor's office.

95
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,253
So what brings you
to this humble men's dressing room?

96
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:53,170
Gosh.

97
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:54,630
It's not like that.

98
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:59,468
By the way, I don't see Dr. Baek.

99
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,345
I think he took a few days off.

100
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:05,349
You've been very interested
in Director Baek lately.

101
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,727
-What's your deal?
-Me?

102
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:10,938
Is something going on between you two?

103
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:13,232
Come on! There's nothing going on.

104
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,818
Not at all.

105
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,570
I'll see you later.

106
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:45,514
Why did he suddenly go on leave?

107
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,850
And a few days at that.

108
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:07,203
But isn't it strange?

109
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,120
What is?

110
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,747
Baek Cheol-gyu is well-off.

111
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,624
Why would he turn to selling drugs?

112
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,418
That's what we need to try and find out.

113
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:18,214
How's your leg?

114
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,174
Yes, I'm sure it'll heal quick.

115
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,180
Mr. Gye.

116
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:30,643
They say Director Baek
has taken leave from work.

117
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:31,644
All of a sudden?

118
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:34,772
You don't think
anything will happen, do you?

119
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,111
Are you worried about something?

120
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,241
No, it's nothing.

121
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:04,552
DIRECTOR BAEK CHEOL-GYU

122
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:23,153
Has the time come for us now
to put this to an end?

123
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:33,038
This didn't get nearly enough views.

124
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,332
I'll have to edit this lost pet ad again.

125
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,306
Mi-jin?

126
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,182
So…

127
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:55,352
Did he sue you for sexual assault
after rejecting your kisser?

128
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,277
Hello?

129
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,405
-What?
-Did he sue you for sexual assault?

130
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:07,489
Sexual…

131
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,241
Hey!

132
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:12,745
Hey, I didn't even kiss him on the lips.

133
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:14,955
I kissed his palm.

134
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,582
How is that sexual assault?

135
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:20,586
The thing about sexual assault
is not where on the body it happened.

136
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:23,130
It's about if that person
felt offended or not.

137
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:24,506
That's what's important.

138
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,841
Felt offended?

139
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:26,759
I mean…

140
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:29,303
But the mood was just…

141
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:31,639
It felt right.

142
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:34,516
Jeez, you moron.

143
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,518
If you're going to do something crazy,

144
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:40,064
I told you to make sure you have
at least a 51% chance of success.

145
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,148
Look, my friend.

146
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:47,655
In that situation, how can I be sure
that I have a 51, 49, 70, or 1% chance?

147
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:48,864
How can I know?

148
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,449
True. You wouldn't know.

149
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:52,660
But it's okay.

150
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:55,663
It's okay. I can fix all of this for you.

151
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,164
Don't worry.

152
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,625
You can trust me. I got you!

153
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,085
I'll fix everything.

154
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:02,002
Whatever.

155
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,003
Look, just…

156
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,965
Were there any posts
on your message boards?

157
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,098
That's cold!

158
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:16,558
Didn't sleep well?

159
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:19,186
I mean, yeah…

160
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,063
I slept well.

161
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,482
-But I woke up at dawn.
-Why?

162
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:26,151
I'm only going to drink decaf now.

163
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:28,404
Why?

164
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,657
I think my biological age
is aging rapidly.

165
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,242
All of a sudden?

166
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,704
Drinking coffee after lunch
keeps me up late at night now.

167
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,583
It doesn't look like
that is what's keeping you up.

168
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,838
My friend's helping me
look for a lost cat,

169
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:49,591
but we stayed up late last night
making a video for it.

170
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,303
Come on.
Then, you should've told me earlier.

171
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:54,638
I'll help you.

172
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:57,224
BROWN AND ORANGE, BLUE EYES,
OLD SCAR ON FACE

173
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:02,688
What?

174
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:03,689
What in the world?

175
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:05,941
What's this doing here?

176
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:09,153
Wow! This is crazy!

177
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,363
Holy cow!

178
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:24,668
This is nuts. How is this real?

179
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,131
IT LOOKS FAMILIAR
I'LL BE ON THE LOOKOUT

180
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,425
WON IS SO KIND
LET'S LOOK TOGETHER, WON

181
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:34,595
THE CAT IS SO CUTE
I SAW IT IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD

182
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:39,099
Someone sent me a DM,
saying they found a similar cat.

183
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:40,809
Let's go see it on the weekend.

184
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:54,156
Hey, don't get out.

185
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:56,033
What if word gets out?

186
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:57,117
I can go alone.

187
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:59,661
It's my post.
I should see it through to the end.

188
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,038
Jeez.

189
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:03,123
Thanks. My friend told me.

190
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,752
Hundreds of millions of followers
saw your social media post.

191
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:09,046
It was effective thanks to that.

192
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,466
I'll return the favor if I find the cat.

193
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:14,760
But…

194
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,054
you sure it's okay to go alone?

195
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,056
Don't you dare get out.

196
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:20,724
-I mean it.
-Still, let's go together--

197
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,117
Are you here about the cat?

198
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:43,497
Are you the person
who said they saw the cat?

199
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,916
What? Why is an old lady here?

200
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:50,170
Where's Ko Won?

201
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:53,882
Well, he only helped
with uploading the post.

202
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,134
I came here alone.

203
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,386
This is so annoying.

204
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,721
-Did you really come alone?
-Yes.

205
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:01,932
But where's the cat?

206
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,475
Don't be ridiculous.

207
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:06,478
-I've never seen that cat before.
-What?

208
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:08,730
But you said you had it.

209
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,150
You sent me a picture.

210
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,026
It looked pretty similar.

211
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,571
It's easy to Photoshop things.

212
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:18,115
Hey, listen!

213
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:21,118
I made this three-hour trip

214
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:23,287
because of the DM you sent.

215
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,168
For your troubles. Happy?

216
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,379
No.

217
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,091
Excuse me!

218
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:42,973
-Let's go.
-Where's the cat?

219
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,309
-I said let's go.
-What?

220
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:47,769
Okay.

221
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:51,815
Damn it.

222
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:10,667
Still avoiding Mr. Gye's call?

223
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:11,919
Yeah. Well…

224
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,214
Things are hectic, and I'm busy.

225
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,675
You're so frustrating.

226
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:20,636
Him too.

227
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,638
He keeps calling you,

228
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:26,016
so I don't think
he's not interested in you.

229
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,894
And you said he only blocked your lips

230
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:31,230
because he thought
you were going to headbutt him.

231
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:35,067
Take this chance and just ask him.

232
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,818
-Ask him what?
-"Do I like you?"

233
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,571
Or "Do you like me?"

234
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,698
-Gosh, you're so annoying.
-I know.

235
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:43,492
You want jajangmyeon later?

236
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:44,868
Yeah, I'll order it.

237
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:51,333
Mr. Gye!

238
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:54,670
-Hello. How are you?
-Hello.

239
00:20:57,881 --> 00:20:58,840
Would you like one?

240
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:00,550
No, I'm fine.

241
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,347
Then, would you like to
come up for a cup of tea?

242
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,473
You're asking me?

243
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:08,809
Then, some alcohol?

244
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:09,977
No, that's…

245
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:12,271
I'll get going.

246
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:13,647
That's too bad!

247
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,816
I wanted to talk to you about Mi-jin.

248
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:19,069
What about her?

249
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:20,862
Take a seat.

250
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,450
Is water okay?

251
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,578
But what did you want to
tell me about Mi-jin?

252
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:32,374
I'll tell you one by one
if you take a seat.

253
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:34,793
Is that necessary?

254
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:41,675
To be honest, Mi-jin is…

255
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:43,510
Just a second.

256
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:45,053
Goodness.

257
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:47,431
She's calling.

258
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:49,016
You should pick up.

259
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:50,600
Okay.

260
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:53,228
Hey, Mi-jin.

261
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,063
Did you call me to buy you pig's trotters?

262
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,649
Just go and buy it yourself.

263
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,568
Or wait until dawn.

264
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:00,652
I see.

265
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,321
Why are you so busy?

266
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:03,613
I think we're here.

267
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:05,198
This is it, right?

268
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:06,533
Goodness.

269
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:07,743
Who's with you?

270
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,578
Is it a guy?

271
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,038
What? What do you want?

272
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:11,955
Hey.

273
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:14,708
His voice sounds so nice.

274
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,209
Does his face look nice too?

275
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:19,421
Anyways, I might not be able
to come in tonight.

276
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:21,340
Tell my mom I'm with you if she calls.

277
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:25,093
All right. Okay.

278
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:28,430
Are you okay?

279
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,558
Okay, have some water.

280
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:37,439
She started dating late,
and now, she's going hard.

281
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:41,818
Shouldn't you stop your friend
from staying out all night?

282
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:42,819
Did you hear that?

283
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:45,489
You must have good hearing.

284
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,075
But why stop her?

285
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:52,996
-Well, it could be dangerous.
-For Mi-jin?

286
00:22:56,374 --> 00:22:57,209
Or for the guy?

287
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:02,798
I doubt it.

288
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:06,259
So what did you want to say earlier?

289
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:07,886
That's right.

290
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:14,184
It's kind of hard for me to say this.

291
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,437
Where should I begin?

292
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:50,053
The wind is blowing

293
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:52,180
Why would this song play now?

294
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:54,266
What a weird algorithm.

295
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,939
The more I think about it,
the stranger she is.

296
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:04,734
After trying to kiss me,
she's spending a night with some guy?

297
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,613
Where is she and what is she doing?

298
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,785
GPS TRACKER

299
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:19,207
What am I doing?

300
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,751
I didn't install it for this.

301
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,212
Get it together.

302
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,506
Don't be lame, Ji-ung.

303
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:52,616
CONTACTS

304
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:56,536
DOCUMENTS

305
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,662
-Hello.
-Hello.

306
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,956
-Did you report seeing the cat?
-Yes, I did.

307
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,208
May I take a look?

308
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:02,626
-Yes, that's okay.
-Okay.

309
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:05,962
PROSECUTOR GYE JI-UNG

310
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:24,272
Hello?

311
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,111
What? Why isn't he saying anything?

312
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:32,948
What is it? You can tell me.

313
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,909
Why are you answering Mi-jin's phone?

314
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:38,578
You don't need to know
about Mi-jin's personal life.

315
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:41,957
Put Mi-jin on.

316
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,918
I'm sorry,
but she's not here right now.

317
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,378
I'll let her know.

318
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:50,215
But the two of us are very busy today.

319
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:53,426
She can't call you right back,
so don't wait.

320
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:56,054
She can't…

321
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:00,267
Serves you right.

322
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:06,815
She's with Ko Won?

323
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:17,534
Damn it.

324
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:32,299
It's hard for any woman
not to like Ko Won.

325
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:34,384
-Do you agree, Mi-jin?
-About what?

326
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:37,262
But if he did like you,
would you date him?

327
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:38,221
Yeah, answer him.

328
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:40,140
Would you go out with Ko Won if he asked?

329
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:42,934
If Ko Won said that he liked me…

330
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:49,649
Your extra-large
spicy pig's trotters and beer.

331
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:51,151
-Thank you!
-Here's the beer.

332
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:53,153
-Thank you.
-Let's eat first.

333
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:02,829
You can pull over here.

334
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:03,747
Yeah.

335
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,123
-Here?
-Yeah.

336
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:07,250
Thanks…

337
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:09,669
for today.

338
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:13,006
Why would you thank me?
I should thank you.

339
00:27:13,631 --> 00:27:15,050
Bye. Thanks.

340
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:26,394
Don't be ridiculous.

341
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:27,354
What?

342
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:29,230
I've never seen that cat before.

343
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:31,649
But you said you had it.

344
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:33,234
You sent me a picture.

345
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,904
It's easy to Photoshop things.

346
00:27:36,654 --> 00:27:37,489
No.

347
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:38,406
What the…

348
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,324
Excuse me!

349
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:44,954
Take this back.

350
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:49,417
Also…

351
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:56,132
Thanks for being Ko Won's fan.

352
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:01,388
And I hope you continue to support him.

353
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:43,930
Damn it.

354
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:48,727
Jeez!

355
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:58,528
Are you sure?

356
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:00,739
Where on Obongsan?

357
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:02,532
Well, I don't know that.

358
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:03,658
You don't know?

359
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:06,995
You don't know? You need to find out.

360
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:09,247
The entrance, summit,
hiking trail, or walking trail?

361
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:11,958
Aren't you asking too much
from a club grunt?

362
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,878
I'm not some detective or anything.

363
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:16,212
HIKING TRAIL
OBONGSAN MOUNTAIN

364
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:17,297
We're so screwed.

365
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,467
It's buried in a place empty of people.

366
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,469
It'll be away from the entrance or trails.

367
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:25,013
This looks too broad of an area to search.

368
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:28,391
Finding evidence is a race against time.
We need to hurry.

369
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:29,809
How?

370
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:38,860
PROSECUTOR GYE JI-UNG

371
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:40,487
You've lost so much weight.

372
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:43,072
Getting locked up is the best diet.

373
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,367
You brought me here to tease me?

374
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:49,871
-I wanted to give you another chance.
-"Chance"?

375
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,040
Jeez.

376
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:54,709
It looks like you need my help.

377
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:57,754
Then, this wouldn't be
"giving me a chance."

378
00:29:57,837 --> 00:29:59,297
Isn't this asking for cooperation?

379
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,008
You're very arrogant.

380
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:04,803
Aren't I the one helping you?

381
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,805
The Narcotics Control Act states

382
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:10,266
that anyone who sells or provides
narcotics to a minor will receive

383
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,435
five years to life in prison.

384
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:15,939
When did I ever sell drugs to a minor?

385
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:18,149
Come on.

386
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:24,614
Recognize them?

387
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:28,618
Those punks! I'll kill them!

388
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:30,954
Seriously, I didn't know they were minors.

389
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:33,414
And I didn't sell them for money,

390
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:34,791
so why is that a problem?

391
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:36,626
Who knows?

392
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:39,712
Charges could change from distribution
to possession if you answer well.

393
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,924
Damn it. I'm not falling for that again.

394
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:46,636
The day after I went to the club,
they immediately stopped selling drugs

395
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:48,596
and removed all of their goods.

396
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,640
So here's my question.

397
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:53,017
Where did they take all of these goods?

398
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:56,187
How am I supposed to know?

399
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:00,191
I've been locked up.
I haven't been pushing for a while.

400
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:02,235
Hey, put some effort into your answers!

401
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:04,237
I mean…

402
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,154
Damn it.

403
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:07,407
I should ask for ten years
instead of five, right?

404
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:08,908
-Let's do ten.
-Ten years?

405
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:10,493
Wait. Wait a second.

406
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:12,871
Jeez.

407
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,126
I don't know the details…

408
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:22,505
but they said
they buried it on a mountain.

409
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:25,049
We know it's Obongsan.

410
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:27,093
We want to know where on Obongsan.

411
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,726
Next to the pavilion at the summit.

412
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:36,769
Pavilion at the summit?

413
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:39,480
Next to the pavilion
are the Five Brother Trees.

414
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:42,066
They told me they hid them
under the last tree.

415
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,985
-Did you hear that?
-Yes, I'm on it.

416
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:46,487
You're going to reduce my sentence, right?

417
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,281
We do have to consider your cooperation.

418
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:49,240
Yes. Right.

419
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:51,284
-Take him away.
-That's it?

420
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:52,201
Yes.

421
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:53,119
I see.

422
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:55,580
Wait a second.

423
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:57,582
I'll be counting on you.

424
00:31:57,665 --> 00:31:58,791
-All right.
-Okay.

425
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,129
By the way,
they apparently weren't minors.

426
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:08,676
-They just wear their school uniforms.
-You damn fraud!

427
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,886
You said they were minors!

428
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:11,095
-Wait!
-Let's go.

429
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,222
I said I'd consider your cooperation.

430
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:15,683
How can I trust that? Wait!

431
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:16,851
Stop moving!

432
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,061
-Come on!
-I said stop!

433
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,566
Don't trust it then.

434
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:28,488
From here…

435
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,659
We have to keep going.

436
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:38,122
-Goodness! I'm sorry, baby! I'm so sorry!
-Jeez.

437
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:46,673
-Why did you stop?
-I can't go any further.

438
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:48,466
We have 60 more kilometers to go.

439
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:50,843
It'll wreck my car if we go further!

440
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:53,304
Is this why you wanted to bring my car?

441
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:57,058
Don't be ridiculous.
Just go. There's no other way.

442
00:32:59,018 --> 00:32:59,894
Ms. Lim.

443
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:03,564
She went and returned
in three hours last time.

444
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,359
Yeah, there's no shot
without knowing a shortcut.

445
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:08,403
Shortcut?

446
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:09,862
Hello, Mr. Ju.

447
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:10,989
Ms. Lim!

448
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:12,156
Wait…

449
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:24,585
Wait. You didn't climb up there
last time, did you?

450
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,129
It's because I hate hiking.

451
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,715
What are you doing?

452
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:31,134
Let's finish the job quick.

453
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:32,969
-Us too?
-Of course.

454
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,182
But I'm…

455
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:40,143
I'm afraid of heights.

456
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:42,478
But… What?

457
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:43,938
Hey, where are you going?

458
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,273
My leg's hurt.

459
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:47,984
You know I'm hurt.
I won't recover if I hurt it more.

460
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:50,028
Where are you going? I know you're healed.

461
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:51,696
You two go and enjoy.

462
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:53,281
Stop pretending to be hurt!

463
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:54,741
Ouch! Wow.

464
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:02,915
Jeez!

465
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,465
What are you doing?

466
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:12,717
Let's have a nice climb.

467
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,218
No, I can't do that.

468
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,262
-Wait.
-I just can't do it!

469
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:18,014
Seriously?

470
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,365
-Are you okay?
-Hold on!

471
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:38,242
How did you get up here?

472
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:42,288
I'm sorry about last time.

473
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:45,958
Going down is harder than climbing up.

474
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:48,127
-There's no time. Let's go.
-Right now?

475
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,506
No, let's rest for one minute!
Just one minute!

476
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:52,924
Come on!

477
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:55,176
What kind of supplements is she taking?

478
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:02,058
For crying out loud!

479
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:04,519
Damn it.

480
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:06,312
Jeez!

481
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,116
Ms. Lim.

482
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:20,368
Let's rest for just five minutes.

483
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:26,374
Wow, I am so exhausted.

484
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:28,626
Wow.

485
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:32,463
I think I sprained my wrist too.

486
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:38,761
Hello!

487
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:41,514
-Who is he?
-He's a naturalist.

488
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:45,226
-What?
-He came to help us find the evidence.

489
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:47,186
Wait for us!

490
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,231
But why did he appear like that?

491
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:52,275
He scared me to death.

492
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:06,247
Are you sure this is it though?

493
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:09,792
Yes. The Five Brother Trees
next to the pavilion.

494
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:14,130
How are they Five Brother Trees?

495
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:17,717
Not all brothers look the same.

496
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:20,052
I mean, they're not five brothers.

497
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:21,971
It's more like almost 20 brothers.

498
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:30,771
Not too long ago, he saw several men
loitering around here at night.

499
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:33,065
That could've been other people.

500
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:37,945
He could just tell me, you know.

501
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,156
He's very shy.

502
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,449
What did he say?

503
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:43,075
"Shut up and dig."

504
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:50,666
Then,

505
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:53,169
starting from this big tree,

506
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:56,214
let's go all the way to the end…

507
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:02,678
I should've come by myself.

508
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,828
I found it!

509
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:29,789
What?

510
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:34,627
What is it?

511
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:40,299
I'm feeling energized.

512
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:43,135
This is no time
to dig for medicinal herbs.

513
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:59,402
-Mr. Gye!
-Yes?

514
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:02,989
-Did you find more medicinal herbs?
-Over here.

515
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:17,712
This is it, right?

516
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:19,338
Yes.

517
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:27,555
Can't we just take the trail down, please?

518
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:28,973
I'll head down first.

519
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:31,267
I have to clock out before the sun sets.

520
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:32,810
You're leaving me alone here?

521
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:34,812
Yes. Bye!

522
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:36,564
But…

523
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:38,357
My goodness!

524
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:41,610
Wow!

525
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:43,654
But…

526
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:49,535
Where do I go to take the trail down?

527
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:54,206
Goodbye.

528
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:10,056
Mr. Gye! Take your time, but hurry up.

529
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:14,518
Ms. Lim clocked out ages ago.
What took you so long?

530
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:18,689
Mr. Gye!

531
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:20,107
-I'm dying!
-Mr. Gye!

532
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,859
My goodness, Mr. Gye!

533
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:23,778
Mr. Gye!

534
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:26,280
You could've damaged the evidence!

535
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,574
I'll ask NFS to analyze these immediately.

536
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:32,787
Please. Give me some water!

537
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:36,082
SEOHAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

538
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:38,793
KING LAND KO WON

539
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:44,048
Mr. Ju, any word from the NFS?

540
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:47,093
I asked them to compare the drugs we found

541
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:49,887
with the one you found
at Hwadong Medical as fast as possible.

542
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:51,680
The results will be out in three days.

543
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:54,100
What about Director Baek's
drug test results?

544
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:55,726
Those all came out negative.

545
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:00,356
Who's your ideal type of woman, Ko Won?

546
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:02,358
My ideal type…

547
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:05,903
Someone who's warm and cozy.

548
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:08,614
Do you like older women as well?

549
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:12,410
Is an age gap that important
in a relationship?

550
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:14,286
Then, how much older would you go?

551
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:16,205
I don't know.

552
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:18,833
I think ten years older is okay.

553
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,751
Age is just a number.

554
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:23,254
She's 20 years older, you punk!

555
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:24,422
Mr. Ju!

556
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:25,548
Twenty years older!

557
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:26,841
-Calm down!
-Please stop!

558
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:30,219
You weren't even born
when Ms. Lim was in college!

559
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:32,847
Someone who's warm and cozy.

560
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,890
She's over 20 years older than you.

561
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:36,434
Twenty years…

562
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:39,228
What have you been doing all day?

563
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:42,773
Go back.

564
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:44,233
-Go to the beginning.
-No.

565
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:45,693
-It's nothing.
-Whatever.

566
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:47,820
-Go back to the start.
-There's nothing there.

567
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:49,822
Yes, there is. Go back. Now.

568
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:57,413
A SCAR HERE

569
00:40:57,496 --> 00:40:59,665
I'm looking for my dear friend's cat.

570
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:01,667
Please help.

571
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:04,086
It's someone I care about.
I want to find it for them.

572
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,631
This guy's ridiculous.

573
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,551
Exactly.

574
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:30,446
SEOHAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

575
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:32,406
Come here. Come on.

576
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:34,366
What is it?

577
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:37,578
I got everything
that's good for you, so take them.

578
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:39,371
Hey…

579
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:40,372
Come on.

580
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:42,082
Take a look.

581
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:44,710
These are for your joints
because you're old.

582
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:45,961
This is lutein.

583
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:49,256
Here, this is for your eyes.
This is milk thistle.

584
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:52,551
This is good for menopause.
Make sure to take it.

585
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:56,597
Forget it! You take them.
Jeez, what are you doing?

586
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,432
Think about your biological age.

587
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:01,685
Wow, what if you get
age-related farsightedness? It'll be bad.

588
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:02,603
I'll kill you!

589
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:05,523
It's not that bad. Look.

590
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:08,984
There we go!

591
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:12,446
It's not medicine. They're supplements.

592
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,281
-Make sure to take them.
-Forget it.

593
00:42:15,991 --> 00:42:17,451
Here, take them.

594
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:18,577
You're ridiculous.

595
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:19,662
Down the hatch.

596
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:22,414
-It's sweet.
-Drink.

597
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:23,874
There you go.

598
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:26,877
-Good, right?
-It's caught in my throat.

599
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:28,879
-Make sure to take them.
-Okay.

600
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:31,006
He called you.

601
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,716
-Who?
-Mr. Gye.

602
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:35,094
-He called that night.
-That night?

603
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:37,429
It wasn't by mistake?

604
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:39,306
He asked for you.

605
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:43,519
Call him tonight, then.

606
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:48,691
He would've called again if it was urgent.

607
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:06,834
You seem excited.

608
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:08,794
What? What is it?

609
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:11,338
Yes. So?

610
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:13,257
Are you done with work?

611
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:14,675
Yes.

612
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:20,222
-I need to talk to you.
-Why?

613
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:23,225
Follow me!

614
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:29,690
Is he crazy?

615
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:31,442
I'm not a narrow-minded boomer.

616
00:43:32,651 --> 00:43:34,403
You receive drinks with both hands.

617
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:38,490
Both hands.

618
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,206
It's etiquette to drink the first shot.

619
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:48,584
Jeez.

620
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:58,427
I drank it. Can I go now?

621
00:44:00,262 --> 00:44:01,388
Sit down!

622
00:44:10,689 --> 00:44:12,775
You have nothing to say,
so why tell me to sit?

623
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:18,322
Listen to what I'm about to say.

624
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:23,327
If a man and woman
have a healthy relationship,

625
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:25,287
I'm very much for it. I fully support it.

626
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:27,122
But what you're doing isn't healthy!

627
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:28,749
Me?

628
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:30,167
It's very dangerous.

629
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:34,963
Why does it have to be Ms. Lim?
What kind of mischief are you up to?

630
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:39,259
Despite her age, Ms. Lim wants
to achieve something in life.

631
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:41,136
She works really hard.

632
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:43,972
She types really fast too!

633
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:47,434
Sometimes it's like I'm listening
to some percussion instrument!

634
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:58,070
Don't swallow the glass! Spit it out.

635
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:02,366
Wow, this guy is not normal.

636
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:05,619
-I fully support you to the end.
-Okay.

637
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:07,246
Look out.

638
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:08,288
My goodness.

639
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:12,000
What in the world? Is he sleeping?

640
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:15,087
How many bottles did he drink?
No wonder why he's asleep.

641
00:45:16,755 --> 00:45:17,840
Damn it.

642
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:21,385
Hey, mister?

643
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:23,679
Let's go home. Come on.

644
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:25,931
Sir! It's time to go home!

645
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:27,182
Yeah.

646
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:30,060
Let's go home.

647
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:32,771
-Let's go.
-Ms. Lim.

648
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:36,191
-Take care of her.
-I will. Let's go.

649
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:37,901
We have to go. We really should.

650
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:40,737
I'll kill you if you hurt her!

651
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:41,905
Why would I hurt her?

652
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:00,174
What's this?

653
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:02,176
Why are they together?

654
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:04,261
When did I ever hurt her?

655
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:05,762
Goodness!

656
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:15,022
I can't even leave him here. Damn it.

657
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:18,025
Sir?

658
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:20,444
Get up. Come on. Let's go.

659
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:23,697
Up like this.

660
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:27,576
-Wake up!
-Wake up!

661
00:46:30,662 --> 00:46:31,538
Seriously?

662
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:33,916
Okay.

663
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:42,007
-Hey, mister.
-Yeah?

664
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:43,634
-What's your password?
-What?

665
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:45,511
-Please buy me some pho.
-No!

666
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:47,554
Not pho. What's your password?

667
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:49,848
Just a second.

668
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:52,601
Look over here. There you go.

669
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:56,730
Okay, again. One more time.

670
00:46:58,023 --> 00:47:00,108
Damn it.

671
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:02,027
We need to…

672
00:47:11,703 --> 00:47:12,704
Hello?

673
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:14,456
This is some guy's phone.

674
00:47:28,428 --> 00:47:31,431
-Ko Won!
-Ko Won!

675
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:34,601
What happened?

676
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:35,894
That's what I want to know.

677
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:38,397
Mr. Ju?

678
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:40,524
Mr. Ju!

679
00:47:41,066 --> 00:47:42,067
He can't hold his liquor.

680
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:43,860
Why did you let him get drunk?

681
00:47:45,862 --> 00:47:47,614
-Mr. Ju?
-What?

682
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:49,491
You think I drugged him?

683
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:56,248
Snap out of it, will you?

684
00:47:56,331 --> 00:47:57,958
Ms. Lim likes pink.

685
00:47:58,041 --> 00:47:59,084
What's he talking about?

686
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:01,670
Help me. Grab his bag.

687
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:04,423
-You've got to be kidding.
-Mr. Ju, get up.

688
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:08,510
I knew he'd cause trouble again.

689
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,347
You are just the worst.

690
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:18,437
Come on.

691
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,605
Excuse us.

692
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:21,523
Goodness.

693
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:26,069
Get in.

694
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:32,492
Jeez. Take his bag too.

695
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:36,371
Get in.

696
00:48:37,205 --> 00:48:38,081
Forget it.

697
00:48:39,207 --> 00:48:41,585
All this exposure
won't do you any good. Get in.

698
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:54,348
Sir, please hurry to a pho restaurant.

699
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:55,432
Hurry.

700
00:49:01,938 --> 00:49:03,023
-Then--
-Hey…

701
00:49:04,566 --> 00:49:05,609
Go ahead.

702
00:49:07,819 --> 00:49:10,864
-What's your relationship with Mi-jin?
-What do you mean?

703
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:15,035
I just wanted to be sure.

704
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:28,924
I hate getting in between two people.

705
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:42,312
Jeez.

706
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:47,025
Gosh, you're so heavy.

707
00:49:58,203 --> 00:50:00,080
Why does he drink so much?

708
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:10,090
What's your relationship with Mi-jin?

709
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:14,845
I hate getting in between two people.

710
00:50:29,025 --> 00:50:32,195
DOCUMENTS

711
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:38,994
Darn it.

712
00:50:58,513 --> 00:50:59,890
-Does it hurt?
-A little.

713
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:08,523
Did I overreact?

714
00:51:09,357 --> 00:51:10,317
Well…

715
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:14,529
What happens if someone was
temporarily insane due to alcohol?

716
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:19,242
Things will depend on if the incident
was an accident or not.

717
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:22,454
I see.

718
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:26,875
Then, this isn't an accident.

719
00:51:27,542 --> 00:51:28,710
What isn't an accident?

720
00:51:30,128 --> 00:51:32,589
Gosh, that blasted alcohol.

721
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:36,843
By the way…

722
00:51:38,386 --> 00:51:40,138
what were you going to say earlier?

723
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:45,685
I'll call you.

724
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:49,272
Why has he stopped calling?

725
00:51:55,111 --> 00:51:55,987
Whatever.

726
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:36,111

POWER OFF

728
00:52:42,158 --> 00:52:44,327
DOCUMENTS

729
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:51,376
The number you have dialed
is unavailable…

730
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:00,719
Gosh, this is bothering me so much.

731
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:25,577
Mr. Gye?

732
00:53:28,663 --> 00:53:31,791
That sofa must be comfortable.
Everyone sleeps so well on it.

733
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:34,586
Has someone else slept here too?

734
00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:38,381
Just a friend.

735
00:53:40,508 --> 00:53:41,968
But how did I get here?

736
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:44,471
How do you think? I dragged you here.

737
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:48,058
There's no time. Eat so we can go to work.

738
00:53:48,141 --> 00:53:49,517
Wait. What time is it?

739
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:51,186
Is there any pho around here?

740
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:53,605
You've been asking for pho
since last night!

741
00:53:53,688 --> 00:53:55,482
You thought I was a driver too.

742
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:57,233
-Don't eat it then.
-Okay. Fine.

743
00:53:58,526 --> 00:53:59,903
-Eat it quickly.
-Okay.

744
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:03,865
-Can I get a latte?
-Are you kidding me?

745
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:05,867
I'll walk in first. Wait five minutes.

746
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:07,953
Why?

747
00:54:09,537 --> 00:54:12,374
-Why?
-It'll look strange to walk in together.

748
00:54:12,457 --> 00:54:14,751
It's okay for two men to sleep together!

749
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:16,670
-Hello.
-Hello.

750
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:17,754
Hello.

751
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:30,850
You're here early.

752
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:33,019
-Mr. Gye.
-Yes?

753
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:34,854
I got the analysis report from NFS.

754
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:39,526
The drug from Hwadong Medical Center
and the drugs from Obongsan are a match.

755
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:43,697
FENTANYL FOUND IN BOTH EVIDENCE 1 AND 2

756
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:44,739
Request a warrant.

757
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:49,411
This should be enough
to get them this time, right?

758
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:52,205
I haven't picked up boxes in a while.

759
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:54,874
I'll need to use my strength.

760
00:55:08,763 --> 00:55:09,931
"Ju Byeong-deok."

761
00:55:12,183 --> 00:55:13,768
Let's see.

762
00:55:27,949 --> 00:55:29,492
TO PROSECUTOR CHA JAE-SEONG

763
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:33,121
THIS IS A TIP! THERE'S A SENIOR INTERN
WHO LIED ABOUT THEIR IDENTITY

764
00:55:55,935 --> 00:55:57,312
Who keeps sending these?

765
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:04,903
These ears are too big.

766
00:56:06,821 --> 00:56:08,281
This one doesn't have a scar.

767
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:15,872
Mi-jin.

768
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:20,168
-Mr. Gye.
-It's late.

769
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:23,338
Why are you here this late?

770
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:25,799
What were you doing?

771
00:56:27,967 --> 00:56:29,636
Something urgent came up.

772
00:56:30,386 --> 00:56:31,930
Right, so what was so urgent?

773
00:56:33,848 --> 00:56:35,016
It's a personal matter.

774
00:56:37,435 --> 00:56:38,895
What you do with Ko Won's a secret.

775
00:56:38,978 --> 00:56:40,730
Your personal matters are secret.

776
00:56:41,314 --> 00:56:43,316
Why do you have so many secrets?

777
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:49,280
You've been making me out
to be some strange person since last time.

778
00:56:50,615 --> 00:56:52,575
Did I do something wrong to you?

779
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:56,079
No, you haven't.

780
00:56:56,162 --> 00:56:59,707
Then, is it a problem if I see Ko Won
over public or personal matters?

781
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:01,960
No, it's not a problem but…

782
00:57:02,043 --> 00:57:04,754
Then, why are you here
interrogating me late at night?

783
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:07,674
I'm not interrogating you.

784
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:12,011
I'm sorry if that's how you felt.

785
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:13,638
But that wasn't my intention.

786
00:57:16,391 --> 00:57:17,600
Then, why did you come?

787
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:21,187
Well…

788
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:24,232
I met your friend.

789
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:27,277
My friend? Ga-yeong?

790
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:29,154
Whenever Mi-jin drinks,

791
00:57:29,237 --> 00:57:30,405
she turns into a puppy.

792
00:57:30,488 --> 00:57:31,698
A puppy?

793
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:33,825
Well… a dog.

794
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:35,160
Woof, woof! A dog.

795
00:57:35,243 --> 00:57:37,537
She'll grab onto anyone
and try to kiss them.

796
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:40,415
She'll kiss anyone?

797
00:57:40,498 --> 00:57:44,043
Just to make sure
there was no misunderstanding,

798
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:46,671
I wanted to let you know.

799
00:57:49,924 --> 00:57:51,092
Was it because of that?

800
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:52,760
Is that why you've avoided my calls?

801
00:57:56,598 --> 00:57:58,558
-What?
-Nothing.

802
00:57:59,684 --> 00:58:00,935
There's no need for that.

803
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:05,148
What do you mean?

804
00:58:05,231 --> 00:58:08,067
There's no misunderstanding,
so don't worry.

805
00:58:09,068 --> 00:58:11,237
And not because
you don't want to misunderstand?

806
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:12,989
What does that mean?

807
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:14,866
Do you know you're really strange?

808
00:58:14,949 --> 00:58:15,783
What?

809
00:58:15,867 --> 00:58:17,911
You show up late, ask strange questions,

810
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:19,704
and tell me not to misunderstand

811
00:58:19,787 --> 00:58:21,206
despite giving mixed messages.

812
00:58:21,289 --> 00:58:23,875
Then, you apologize for no reason.
What's wrong with you?

813
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:27,670
I think you're misunderstanding
what I'm saying right now.

814
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:29,172
I'm not misunderstanding you!

815
00:58:31,883 --> 00:58:34,260
-That's not what I meant--
-I promise I won't.

816
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:35,845
I know how you feel now,

817
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:36,930
so you can go.

818
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:40,892
But I'm not done…

819
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:42,685
talking yet.

820
00:58:47,982 --> 00:58:48,942
What's with her?

821
00:58:58,451 --> 00:59:00,245
She knows how I feel about what?

822
00:59:15,843 --> 00:59:17,804
Why did he even come here?

823
00:59:19,472 --> 00:59:20,557
He denied everything.

824
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:23,810
Misunderstanding?
What did I misunderstand?

825
00:59:25,937 --> 00:59:28,815
What am I supposed to do?

826
00:59:56,551 --> 00:59:59,345
He didn't have an umbrella when he left.

827
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:02,515
Well, he has a car. He'll be fine.

828
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:04,851
Yeah, because he's so good at everything.

829
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:06,769
He can block the rain like this too.

830
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:30,668
Hey!

831
01:00:32,211 --> 01:00:34,672
Why are you in the rain?
What's the matter?

832
01:00:35,506 --> 01:00:36,674
I was worried.

833
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:38,092
All of a sudden at this hour?

834
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:40,345
Can't you just quit
from the prosecutors' office?

835
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:44,974
Seriously, why are you
doing this to me too?

836
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:46,351
Did someone upset you?

837
01:00:46,434 --> 01:00:48,895
Forget it. Why are you here?
What did you want to tell me?

838
01:00:55,151 --> 01:00:56,402
Quit your public works job.

839
01:00:57,570 --> 01:00:59,489
If you need it, I'll pay your salary.

840
01:00:59,572 --> 01:01:00,490
Hey.

841
01:01:00,573 --> 01:01:02,784
You can help with my work
if you don't want it for free.

842
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:06,496
I heard you already told Mr. Gye
that you worked with me.

843
01:01:07,121 --> 01:01:07,997
Just do that.

844
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:10,166
What's with everyone today?

845
01:01:10,249 --> 01:01:13,378
It's like irritating me wasn't enough,
so you have to piss me off.

846
01:01:14,837 --> 01:01:16,964
Go brag about your money somewhere else.

847
01:01:17,048 --> 01:01:19,384
I'm too busy trying
to make a living to care at all.

848
01:01:19,467 --> 01:01:21,135
No, that's not what I meant.

849
01:01:21,219 --> 01:01:22,970
I looked pathetic,
so are you pitying me?

850
01:01:24,305 --> 01:01:25,473
Am I a charity case?

851
01:01:26,724 --> 01:01:27,558
Pity?

852
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:33,564
How could I?

853
01:01:34,816 --> 01:01:36,567
You think life's easier with money?

854
01:01:37,443 --> 01:01:40,488
Then, why do I take so many meds
from my psychiatrist and sleeping pills

855
01:01:40,571 --> 01:01:41,906
to go to bed every night?

856
01:01:43,074 --> 01:01:44,575
So why are you doing this?

857
01:01:44,659 --> 01:01:45,702
I don't know!

858
01:01:46,327 --> 01:01:48,162
It's my first time, so I don't know.

859
01:01:49,956 --> 01:01:51,457
I just really like someone,

860
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:54,502
but I'm worried to death
that something might happen to her.

861
01:01:54,585 --> 01:01:55,795
I'm restless.

862
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:57,547
I can't get anything done all day.

863
01:01:58,589 --> 01:02:01,426
I'm so preoccupied
that I even forget to take my pills.

864
01:02:02,135 --> 01:02:03,428
I've never felt this way before.

865
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:19,360
About who?

866
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:23,656
You.

867
01:03:20,296 --> 01:03:23,216
MISS NIGHT AND DAY

868
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:25,927
Mr. Gye called in sick today.

869
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:27,011
He's sick?

870
01:03:27,595 --> 01:03:31,140
All the food
from the refrigerator is gone!

871
01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:33,100
He looked just like Ko Won.

872
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:34,018
Like who?

873
01:03:34,977 --> 01:03:36,062
Don't go.

874
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:39,607
We got the search warrant for Hwadong.

875
01:03:41,692 --> 01:03:42,693
Fierce presence, my foot.

876
01:03:43,861 --> 01:03:45,404
Any pictures of them together?

877
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:47,824
Lim Sun disappears
without a trace after work.

878
01:03:47,907 --> 01:03:49,826
We should check for ourselves.

879
01:03:49,909 --> 01:03:51,994
By any chance,
did something happen to Mi-jin?

880
01:03:52,453 --> 01:03:53,663
Lee Mi-jin!

881
01:03:56,415 --> 01:04:01,045
