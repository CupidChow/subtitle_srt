1
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:45,962
MISS NIGHT AND DAY

2
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:52,802
I found Gong Eun-sim.

3
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:57,932
Ms. Kang Gyeong-hui.

4
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:00,143
She'd been right next to us.

5
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:05,982
She pretended to be Na Ok-hui
and got a job here.

6
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,859
She's a senior intern like Ms. Lim.

7
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:10,403
I found her.

8
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:13,907
I know who killed Ko Na-heun.

9
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:22,624
Dad!

10
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,126
Na Ok-hui. She's the culprit.

11
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:27,629
Lee Mi-jin.

12
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:31,132
Don't tell anyone.

13
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,967
Come to where we first met.

14
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:35,887
Where's my dad?

15
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,680
I've changed the location though.

16
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:12,215
DAD

17
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,309
Dad!

18
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:39,117
-You're all done now.
-Thank you.

19
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:41,536
Not bad.

20
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,832
My procedure just finished. How do I look?

21
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:48,459
It's been a while
since I splurged on my skin.

22
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:52,755
I'll post the full video
of this makeover tomorrow.

23
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,299
I hope you watch. Bye!

24
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:55,717
-Don't forget your things.
-Okay.

25
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,719
-And come to the front desk, please.
-Okay.

26
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:05,184
MISSED CALLS
MI-JIN

27
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:07,228
What is this?

28
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:11,941
If you can't reach me, call the cops.

29
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,992
The person you are trying to call…

30
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:23,411
Damn it! Why won't she pick up?

31
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:24,787
Mr. Gye.

32
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,041
Wait, I don't have his number.

33
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:29,834
What do I do?

34
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:35,757
MOVE YOUR CAR

35
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,684
Hey, neighbor.
To what do I owe this pleasure?

36
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:47,727
Hi, it's me.

37
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,812
I think something's happened to Mi-jin.

38
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,272
What are you talking about?

39
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,316
I have 12 missed calls from her.

40
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:56,110
I wasn't able to pick up at the time.

41
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,904
But I got a text from her too.

42
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:00,823
She told me to call the cops
if I couldn't reach her.

43
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:02,742
What do I do?

44
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:08,873
-Zoom in here.
-Yes, sir.

45
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:10,959
-Mr. Gye!
-Yes?

46
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:13,086
I think something's happened to Mi-jin.

47
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:15,922
-What do you mean?
-I got a call from your neighbor.

48
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:18,800
Mi-jin texted her to call the cops
if she couldn't be reached.

49
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,593
And she hasn't been picking up since.

50
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:22,637
What are you talking about?

51
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:29,894
The person you are trying to call…

52
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,859
LAST SIGNAL LOCATION
113-7 CHUKMALMYEON, SEOHAN CITY

53
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:39,070
It's a map.

54
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:40,154
She sent me the location.

55
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:42,073
24-3 CHUKMALMYEON, SEOHAN CITY

56
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:46,077
Ms. Lee Mi-jin!

57
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:57,547
Detective Kwon.

58
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,758
Get the location from Mr. Ju,
and ask for backup now.

59
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,593
-Yes, sir.
-Here it is.

60
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:04,512
Wait, Mr. Gye!

61
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:05,638
I'll text it to you.

62
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:08,850
HWARIMDANG TRADITIONAL TEAHOUSE

63
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,812
LEE MI-JIN
LIM MI-JIN

64
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:31,622
Where's my dad?

65
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:35,668
Where's my dad?

66
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:39,088
Where is my dad?

67
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:50,683
You didn't hurt him, did you?

68
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:53,728
Your dad isn't the one I want to hurt.

69
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,066
Lee Mi-jin.

70
00:05:58,691 --> 00:05:59,650
It's you.

71
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:17,293
Detective Kwon,
anything to report from there?

72
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:19,712
Okay. Then, come quick
to the address I texted you.

73
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:48,324
Did you find her phone?

74
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:49,617
It's not Mi-jin's.

75
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:01,754
The last locations of Lee Mi-jin,
Na Ok-hui, and Gong Gi-cheol were here,

76
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,381
and all their phones are off.

77
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,635
I'm going to look around.
Find out whose phone this is.

78
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:08,719
Okay.

79
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:36,414
Did you find any other signs?

80
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:37,957
No, nothing yet.

81
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,001
Mr. Gye.

82
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:42,295
The phone belongs to Mi-jin's father.

83
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:43,379
Her father?

84
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,090
Fortunately, the officers
searching the teahouse

85
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,717
found where he was locked up.

86
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:53,931
There's someone here!

87
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,226
He came to right away.

88
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,605
After speaking with him,
he said he passed out after drinking tea.

89
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:02,482
He doesn't remember anything else.

90
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,861
Na Ok-hui… I mean,

91
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:09,572
Gong Eun-sim's old house
is near here apparently.

92
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:10,656
Where is it?

93
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:10,299
Do you know what's more fun
than hanging and beating a dog to death?

94
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:13,219
It's hearing the whimpering

95
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:17,390
of a dying dog using its last bit
of strength to beg for its life.

96
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:21,310
That's when its true nature emerges.

97
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,112
You killed my aunt, didn't you?

98
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,202
Is that important right now?

99
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,579
Of course, it is.

100
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:44,166
My family searched frantically
and waited so long for her.

101
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:46,961
But you didn't find her.

102
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:52,258
You should've tried harder
if you loved her that much.

103
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:56,095
You gave up in the end

104
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:57,680
and abandoned her.

105
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,811
You don't even know where she is now.

106
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:32,006
Damn it.

107
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,048
Did you find anything?

108
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:15,675
No, there's nothing here.

109
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,135
There's nothing here, sir.

110
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,514
But it seems someone
lived here recently.

111
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:24,809
-You find anything?
-No, not yet.

112
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:29,980
Mr. Gye!

113
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,463
LEE MI-JIN
LIM MI-JIN

114
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:08,269
What in the world is this?

115
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:10,646
She must've been here.

116
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,315
Have this area searched now.

117
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,776
-Redirect backup to come here.
-Yes, sir.

118
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:22,658
It's me. Don't go to the greenhouse.

119
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:25,119
Come here first.
I'll send the coordinates.

120
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,413
Come right now. Okay.

121
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,044
Mr. Gye!

122
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:36,464
Have just a few on standby.

123
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,257
Everyone else, get here right now!

124
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:35,147
Come out, come out, wherever you are

125
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:39,443
Come out, come out

126
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:53,791
Mi-jin!

127
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:57,836
Lee Mi-jin!

128
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:54,768
Where is she?

129
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:04,695
Where are you?

130
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,129
What are you doing here?

131
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,302
But I killed you.

132
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:11,595
Please don't kill me.

133
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:13,722
Must be nice to have a family.

134
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:16,392
You have people who worry about you.

135
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:21,522
Please don't kill me!

136
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,066
I'm sure I killed you.

137
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:29,029
Why are you…

138
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,284
Stay away.

139
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:38,580
Why did you do it?

140
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,625
Isn't this what you talked about?

141
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:45,004
Wanting to die but not being able to?

142
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,547
Stay back!

143
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:50,968
Stay back?

144
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,595
Now, it's your turn.

145
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:54,680
Stay away from me!

146
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:33,927
Mi-jin!

147
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:57,826
Detective Kwon, I caught the culprit.

148
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,495
I'll send the coordinates so come here.

149
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:07,711
Mi-jin!

150
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,094
Did you know?

151
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:18,555
They say cats give back
as much as they receive.

152
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,760
Over here! We found something!

153
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:21,011
Come over here!

154
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,102
According to KCSI,

155
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:31,021
it's been about 20 years.

156
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:34,399
We'll know for sure
after a thorough analysis.

157
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:39,905
Yes, Captain?

158
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:42,407
Yes, we're wrapping things up now.

159
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:44,660
Am I pretty?

160
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,120
Of course. You take after me.

161
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,164
It's a gift for you.

162
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,583
Wow, it's a huge diamond ring!

163
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:41,216
Here.

164
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:48,432
They said the first snow
of the season's falling tonight.

165
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:50,058
How about we make a snowman?

166
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,560
You really promise?

167
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:53,020
I really promise.

168
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:54,771
I'll be home soon.

169
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:55,939
Hurry home.

170
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:22,609
Mi-jin, are you awake?

171
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,737
Hey, don't get up. Just lie down.

172
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:27,656
What happened?

173
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:29,574
You know what you did wrong, don't you?

174
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:34,412
Damn it. If you weren't hurt,
I'd kill you myself. I swear.

175
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:41,795
Are you insane?

176
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:43,755
Why would you even go there?

177
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:47,843
What if something
terrible happened to you?

178
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:49,970
I had no choice.

179
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:53,265
She had my dad and threatened me.
What could I do?

180
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:56,935
What about my dad? Is he okay?

181
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:59,437
He was admitted upstairs.

182
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:01,815
I have to see him.

183
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:03,150
No, you can't go like this.

184
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:06,611
I went to see him.

185
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:09,698
He's fine. So don't worry and rest.

186
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:12,659
I'll tell the nurse you're up.

187
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:13,827
Just rest, okay?

188
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,809
What are you doing here?

189
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:40,729
I'm sure I killed you.

190
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:45,358
It was really scary, right?

191
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:48,612
When you're in danger next time,

192
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:51,656
I promise I'll come to your rescue.

193
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:53,992
What if you're not around?

194
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:55,911
I'm not going anywhere.

195
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,621
I'll be right by your side.

196
00:24:57,704 --> 00:25:01,541
I'll come running to save you.

197
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:03,126
You promise?

198
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:08,215
Pinky swear.

199
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:10,675
And seal it. Boom.

200
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:04,646
Cheong,

201
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:06,731
it's a misunderstanding.

202
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,733
I didn't tell him to go

203
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:11,695
when I gave him
the address of the teahouse.

204
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:14,281
He tried to stop me.

205
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,741
But I was stubborn.

206
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:21,621
That's right!
I kept telling him he shouldn't go.

207
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:24,082
But he forced it out of me with threats.

208
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:25,667
That's not true.

209
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,793
Both of you, shut it.

210
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:33,133
Honey, you and Mi-jin are all I have now.

211
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:34,843
Got it?

212
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,220
Please. I'm begging you.

213
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:39,389
Okay, I was wrong.

214
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,100
Dad.

215
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:44,477
I'm sorry.

216
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:47,731
It's all my fault.

217
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:50,066
Why won't she pick up?

218
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,652
I wonder if she knows
her father's in the hospital.

219
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:55,905
She's probably busy with work.
Don't keep calling her.

220
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:56,865
Give me a second.

221
00:26:57,574 --> 00:26:58,616
Goodness.

222
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,076
What is she doing?

223
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,037
Good grief.

224
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:07,459
The person you are trying to call…

225
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:43,119
Why haven't I changed back yet?

226
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,999
Does a day need to pass
after catching the culprit?

227
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:56,925
I said I'm okay! I'm completely fine,
so why would I stay here?

228
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:58,885
Will you just listen?

229
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:00,345
The doctor told you.

230
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:03,765
They said to stay the night
and see how you progress!

231
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,934
-Yeah.
-You're still in a neck brace too.

232
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:07,560
-This is--
-Dad!

233
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:10,522
Dad, were you hurt anywhere else?

234
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:11,606
I'm fine.

235
00:28:11,689 --> 00:28:13,400
-Goodness.
-Dad.

236
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:15,485
I thought I'd never see you again.

237
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:17,195
I was so scared.

238
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:18,571
Goodness!

239
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:19,906
What's with you?

240
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:20,949
You brat!

241
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:22,909
Why didn't you answer your phone?

242
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:25,495
I lost my phone.

243
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:27,705
-What?
-How did you know your dad was here?

244
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,834
Ga-yeong called me at work.

245
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:32,669
-I see.
-What happened to your face?

246
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,046
This?

247
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:36,589
I nicked it at work.

248
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:38,633
-How did you scratch your face at work?
-Gosh.

249
00:28:38,716 --> 00:28:41,052
Dad, I'm so glad you're okay.

250
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:42,345
Goodness.

251
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:44,723
I'm fine. I'm okay.

252
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:45,640
-You are?
-Yeah.

253
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:46,558
Hello?

254
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:51,396
Yes, this is Lim Cheong.

255
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:52,689
The police station?

256
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:56,234
Yes!

257
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:57,777
Yes, my sister's Lim Sun…

258
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:03,491
Yes.

259
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:07,620
The culprit of the mutilation murder

260
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:10,331
that occurred in Seohan
last October has been caught.

261
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:13,752
The culprit attempted to kidnap
and kill a witness she had run into

262
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:15,879
while fleeing from a crime
she previously committed.

263
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:18,840
Her attempt failed when the victim
escaped from where she was held.

264
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:19,966
While pursuing the victim,

265
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:23,261
the culprit was caught by prosecutors
and police searching the area.

266
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:26,222
A large number of opium poppies
and drugs derived from its substances

267
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:28,683
were found in the culprit's greenhouse.

268
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,478
And the extent of her crimes
doesn't stop there.

269
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:33,938
In the yard of the culprit's old house,

270
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:36,608
the skeletonized remains
of two bodies were discovered.

271
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:39,402
Both were identified as victims
of a missing persons case

272
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:41,321
in Seohan that began in 2000.

273
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:44,949
The victims were finally returned
to their families after 24 years.

274
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:48,703
I heard one of the victims
was your mother.

275
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:51,539
Why didn't you tell me?

276
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:53,750
I wasn't sure.

277
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:57,337
My mother was just a witness in the case.

278
00:29:58,671 --> 00:30:01,049
Her body wasn't found
after she went missing.

279
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,553
So that's why you worked day and night

280
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:08,306
to find the missing persons.

281
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:13,061
Let's take you off the case.

282
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:17,607
Give it to Ms. Tak.

283
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:44,509
Go in.

284
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:46,135
I know you have a lot of questions.

285
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,556
The case hasn't been transferred yet.

286
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:13,079
Don't you have questions?

287
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:15,707
"Why my mom?"

288
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:18,001
"Why did you kill her?"

289
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:19,794
That's what you're going to ask.

290
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:23,464
Just do it. Don't waste time.

291
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:31,264
So why did you kill her?

292
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:33,516
Why did you have to do it on a snowy day?

293
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:39,230
I could've made memories with my mom.
Why did it have to be that day?

294
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:42,817
You're making this woman
with no son so sad.

295
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:45,361
You think having no son,
family, or parents,

296
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:46,905
made your life turn out this way?

297
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:49,741
We decide our own fates.

298
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:51,993
You did this to yourself.

299
00:31:57,832 --> 00:31:59,834
You think you know my life?

300
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,085
Do you?

301
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:02,712
You know nothing.

302
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:04,631
No matter how low I sink,

303
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:07,425
I'd never become scum like you.

304
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:10,053
You should've lived like a decent human.

305
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:15,266
Hey, Hui-jin.

306
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:20,313
You died without getting to see
your precious son.

307
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:21,564
Poor you.

308
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:23,775
You must be so resentful.

309
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:31,866
ROYAL COFFEEHOUSE

310
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,117
Hey.

311
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:35,286
I'll call you back.

312
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,871
Why do you look so out of it?

313
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,874
I think I saw a lunatic.
He was dragging a woman away.

314
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:44,045
I'll work really hard.

315
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:46,589
Even a little glimpse is enough.

316
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:49,300
I didn't see anything.
I couldn't see anything.

317
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:51,970
Jeez, I shouldn't have told
the detectives.

318
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,513
Want me to talk to Detective No?

319
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:03,648
I'll tell you what I saw that night.

320
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:08,152
How about we make a snowman?

321
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:09,988
I'll be home soon.

322
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:16,536
What on earth?

323
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:18,913
-You didn't go home?
-It looks like snow.

324
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:20,707
Go straight home.

325
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,375
Damn it.

326
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:24,961
I never should've said
I'd give a statement.

327
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,760
I really don't know anything.

328
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,971
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

329
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:43,855
Your mom called out for you so much.

330
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:48,067
Not only did you wait all night
but you also waited for decades?

331
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:51,112
Want to know the last thing your mom said

332
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,406
as she died?

333
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,035
"Eun-sim."

334
00:33:57,994 --> 00:33:59,245
"I'm sorry."

335
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:01,164
Eun-sim.

336
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:02,623
I'm sorry.

337
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:06,377
I didn't tell anyone.

338
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:11,090
"Ji-ung's been waiting all night."

339
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:12,759
I made a promise…

340
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,012
to Ji-ung.

341
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:38,993
"I made a promise to Ji-ung."

342
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:47,168
"Please don't kill me."

343
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:52,673
"Please don't kill me!"

344
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:14,612
That's right.

345
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:18,282
I waited 20 years.

346
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:22,203
But this is all you've got?

347
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,705
Just pay for your sins.

348
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:40,388
Mr. Gye.

349
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:56,696
Here.

350
00:35:57,363 --> 00:35:58,614
Herbal cigarettes.

351
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:03,828
After that day, I became a chain smoker.

352
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:06,873
Then, I thought,
"Gosh, this will kill me one day."

353
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:08,499
And I got by with those.

354
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:13,045
If I had arrived
just a bit earlier that day…

355
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:17,508
If I had made
that right turn a bit faster…

356
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:18,926
No.

357
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:22,763
I should've got out of the car and ran.

358
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:27,268
I've regretted it every day.

359
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:31,564
I know they're pointless regrets.

360
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:53,502
DETENTION CENTER

361
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:57,757
The statute of limitations has expired.

362
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,550
But for the murders of Ko Na-heun

363
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:01,219
and Na Ok-hui,

364
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:03,679
and for attempting to kill me,

365
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:06,349
she'll receive at least a life sentence.

366
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:10,269
Thank you.

367
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:14,649
You kept your promise.

368
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:21,906
I heard you're refusing treatment.

369
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:24,992
Think of your family on the outside,

370
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,827
and get the treatment, Dr. Baek.

371
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:29,288
Now, I can finally face

372
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,708
my children again.

373
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:47,139
I'm Lim Sun and I worked as an office aide
at Seohan District Prosecutors' Office.

374
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:49,558
I helped Prosecutor Gye Ji-ung

375
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:52,478
investigate Ko Na-heun's murder case.

376
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:56,482
I learned anonymous letters
were being sent to Mr. Cha's office,

377
00:37:56,565 --> 00:38:00,403
saying a senior public intern had lied
about their identity to get their job.

378
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:02,780
The reason why I didn't report
the letter right away was

379
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:04,240
when I was given my duties,

380
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:07,493
I was told Mr. Cha usually receives
many threatening letters,

381
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:10,162
so I was instructed to
filter them out in advance.

382
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:13,582
I believed that letter
was one of those threatening ones.

383
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:15,459
After learning of the letter,

384
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,296
we checked the facts together.

385
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:21,799
I learned the person being accused
was Na Ok-hui.

386
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:22,967
Before reporting it,

387
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:25,344
I wanted to find out
if the accusations were true.

388
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:26,554
In that process,

389
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:29,015
I received help from Lim Sun.

390
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:30,975
Through Mr. Ju Byeong-deok,

391
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:34,645
I confirmed that Na Ok-hui
was a fake identity.

392
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:38,149
However, Na Ok-hui
had already disappeared by then.

393
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:40,901
I WILL COOPERATE WITH INVESTIGATIONS

394
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:41,819
LIM SUN

395
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:44,113
Their statements align perfectly.

396
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:45,948
Is that a problem?

397
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:48,534
They match almost too well.

398
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:51,329
Also, do you know how many times
they said "by coincidence"?

399
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:52,455
I don't know.

400
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:54,665
When I read it earlier,

401
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:57,376
it didn't look like it'd be an issue.

402
00:38:58,419 --> 00:38:59,670
It wouldn't be.

403
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:01,630
But something feels very off.

404
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:04,133
Come on. Everything's in our favor.

405
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:06,344
It's like having a feast laid before us.

406
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:10,014
All we need to do is eat.
It's a total gain for us!

407
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:14,769
That's what bothers me the most.

408
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:19,273
You said it all worked out without issues.

409
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:20,858
Then, isn't that a good thing?

410
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:22,485
That's the strange thing.

411
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:23,402
What is?

412
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:24,987
I mean,

413
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:28,616
if they'd kept probing,
that could've caused problems.

414
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:31,285
But it's strange how things moved on
without any issues.

415
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:35,414
Let it go now. Please.

416
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:37,375
Forget about that crazy bitch too, okay?

417
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:42,838
Let's relax and wait.

418
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:44,965
For what?

419
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:47,802
The culprit's been caught,
so you'll change back soon.

420
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:51,222
That would've happened already then.

421
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:52,139
True.

422
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:53,724
You're right.

423
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:59,230
COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO
CALL ME

424
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:09,240
How long are you going to
keep avoiding him for?

425
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:11,867
I can't avoid him forever.

426
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:14,912
I have to end it.

427
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:16,914
Hey, wait.

428
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:19,667
I'm sure my aunt was identified.

429
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:22,837
No matter what excuse I give,

430
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,588
it'll be strange.

431
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:27,633
He'd never understand.

432
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:29,760
Can't you just tell him the truth?

433
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:34,140
Who knew Aunt Sun
would show up like this?

434
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:37,560
What I'm saying is

435
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:41,480
it's such a relief
that she was even discovered.

436
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:42,523
But it's just…

437
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:45,776
the timing wasn't all that great.

438
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:49,029
I think it's all my fault.

439
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:50,865
No, it's not!

440
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:52,408
It's because of that crazy bitch!

441
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:54,201
Why would it be your fault?

442
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:55,661
Maybe

443
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:57,746
deep down,

444
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,874
it's what I wanted to believe.

445
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:03,544
Maybe I thought
my aunt wouldn't suddenly show up,

446
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:08,466
and it'd be okay to live
with her name like this.

447
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:13,429
It's not your fault.

448
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:17,099
It's all thanks to you.

449
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:18,642
Thanks to you,

450
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:21,437
they were able to find everyone.

451
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:24,398
Aunt Sun and Mr. Gye's mom.

452
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:32,698
Even if others don't know,

453
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:35,493
I do.

454
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:40,581
You did something incredible.

455
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:46,212
Also, I dare anyone
to point their finger at you!

456
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:49,381
I'll break each and every one
of those fingers!

457
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:51,342
You couldn't break anything
with those arms.

458
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:53,385
I'll break them all!

459
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,721
Don't be ridiculous.

460
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:58,766
Stop it.

461
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:01,143
I mean it, you brat!

462
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:07,816
Mi-jin,

463
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:09,693
I'm so proud

464
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:13,364
to have you as my friend.

465
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:18,202
I mean that 100%.

466
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,373
No, 50,000%.

467
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:24,833
Why are you crying?

468
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,586
Because you're crying.

469
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:31,549
Stop it.

470
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:35,261
Jeez.

471
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:36,845
We're out of makgeolli.

472
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:38,681
Don't cry, okay?

473
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:55,864
ARE YOU OKAY? DON'T SKIP YOUR MEALS
I'LL WAIT FOR YOUR CALL

474
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:06,917
Mr. Gye.

475
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:09,003
Could you take a quick look at this?

476
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:10,921
Yes, right here.

477
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:33,736
ARE YOU OKAY? DON'T SKIP YOUR MEALS
I'LL WAIT FOR YOUR CALL

478
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:46,415
-PHO AGAIN? UNBELIEVABLE!
-YOU'RE DEAD, JU BYEONG-DEOK

479
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:50,711
SO HANDSOME

480
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:58,594
Remember before when you asked me
to keep my promise?

481
00:43:58,677 --> 00:44:00,054
I'll keep that promise.

482
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:02,640
I'll protect you no matter what.

483
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:05,851
So put a little more trust in me,
even if you're worried.

484
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:11,982
You have reasons and circumstances
you can't reveal. I understand.

485
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:14,943
Because you're the only person
I fully trust.

486
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:49,228
PROSECUTOR GYE JI-UNG

487
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:13,335
ROOM 307
GYE JI-UNG, JU BYEONG-DEOK, LIM SUN

488
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:50,831
DOGAVILL STUDIO APARTMENT

489
00:45:51,748 --> 00:45:54,168
Mi-jin! I told you to just sleep over.

490
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:55,419
It's fine.

491
00:45:55,502 --> 00:46:00,007
What if something else happens to you?

492
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:03,010
Do you have any idea

493
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:06,305
how much I've wanted to walk around
at night without any worries?

494
00:46:08,765 --> 00:46:10,142
I'm leaving. I'll call you.

495
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:18,442
-Call me when you get there.
-Okay.

496
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:19,526
-Bye.
-Bye.

497
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:20,444
I'll call you.

498
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:22,529
Be careful.

499
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:23,447
Okay.

500
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:24,448
Call me!

501
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:25,365
Got it.

502
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:32,122
Come on!

503
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:45,177
Well,

504
00:46:46,011 --> 00:46:47,429
he did help.

505
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:54,144
-Who parks like this?
-Excuse me?

506
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:58,482
Just park in front of Dogavill.

507
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:01,360
If you'll allow it…

508
00:47:01,443 --> 00:47:02,778
-Thank you.
-Okay.

509
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:04,738
In return,

510
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:07,449
don't hit on me with your skills anymore.

511
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:08,784
My skills?

512
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:10,494
Don't come out and flirt with me.

513
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:13,038
Just go home and treat your wife better.

514
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:16,041
Wait, what are you talking about?

515
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:17,459
I may not look it,

516
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:19,378
but I care a lot about ethics and morals.

517
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:22,089
I'm not some hussy who messes
with someone else's man

518
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:23,507
and gets in catfights!

519
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:27,511
"Someone else's man"? I'm a bachelor.
More specifically, an old bachelor.

520
00:47:27,594 --> 00:47:28,470
What?

521
00:47:29,846 --> 00:47:31,473
But Mi-jin… I mean,

522
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:32,599
my aunt said

523
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:35,269
that you were married.

524
00:47:35,894 --> 00:47:37,896
That's what I've told publicly.

525
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:40,107
But there's a long
and sad story behind it.

526
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:41,942
So you're not married?

527
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:47,281
Two days wouldn't be enough
to tell you the full story.

528
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:49,533
I see.

529
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:51,660
What should we do?

530
00:47:51,743 --> 00:47:54,371
Should we go inside
and talk about that story then?

531
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:56,915
We can have some ramyun.

532
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:00,544
-Ramyun?
-Ramyun.

533
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:04,006
Okay.

534
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,925
You can park there. I'll help.

535
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:08,343
-No, that's fine.
-Okay.

536
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:10,929
Get in. We can go for a drive first.

537
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:12,222
That sounds good.

538
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:13,890
I'll get the door!

539
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:56,642
How long have you been waiting?

540
00:48:57,392 --> 00:48:58,518
Not long.

541
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:02,272
Where were you? What were you doing?

542
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:03,315
It's late.

543
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:05,025
Well, just…

544
00:49:06,568 --> 00:49:09,112
I wanted to walk around at night in peace.

545
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:15,869
But why have you been avoiding me lately?

546
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:30,050
I have something to tell you.

547
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:34,471
You've asked several times,
but I couldn't answer.

548
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:37,683
It's about what I do for work

549
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:41,186
and why we can't meet during the day.

550
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:43,105
You don't have to.

551
00:49:43,188 --> 00:49:44,398
No.

552
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:46,858
It's been so hard each time
I've had to hide it from you.

553
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:48,527
I just want to tell you everything now.

554
00:49:51,196 --> 00:49:53,990
What I'm trying to say is…

555
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:56,827
The thing is…

556
00:49:57,577 --> 00:49:59,037
The fact that you're Lim Sun?

557
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:05,502
Or…

558
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:08,130
that Lim Sun is Lee Mi-jin?

559
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:13,301
How did you know?

560
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:16,096
No, since when?

561
00:50:19,015 --> 00:50:20,434
I saw everything that day.

562
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:35,323
Despite seeing it for myself,
I couldn't believe it.

563
00:50:47,252 --> 00:50:48,545
"Was I mistaken?"

564
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:51,214
"Did I hallucinate?"

565
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:55,719
But the more I thought about it,

566
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,305
the more everything made sense.

567
00:50:59,514 --> 00:51:01,516
Your whereabouts

568
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:04,144
and Ms. Lim's strange behavior.

569
00:51:05,061 --> 00:51:06,688
"So that's why all of that happened."

570
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:09,733
It took me some time to understand that.

571
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,991
You should've just told me. If you had--

572
00:51:18,074 --> 00:51:19,367
How could I tell you?

573
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:25,081
It's the side of me I least want to show
to the person I care about the most.

574
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:28,001
How could I tell you that?

575
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:31,755
Still, if you really had trusted me,
you should've told me.

576
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:33,423
If I hadn't hidden it from you,

577
00:51:34,132 --> 00:51:37,093
I never would've even had
the opportunity to work with you.

578
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:39,513
To me,

579
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:43,642
it was a job I could've never obtained
no matter how hard I tried.

580
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:46,937
But strangely enough,
I got the opportunity

581
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:48,104
once I aged.

582
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:53,360
No matter how much I wished,
it was something I could never have.

583
00:51:57,489 --> 00:52:00,325
That's why I couldn't quit
despite knowing it was wrong.

584
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:06,373
I'd already fallen in love with the job…

585
00:52:09,751 --> 00:52:13,421
and I loved coming to work
every morning to see you.

586
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:18,093
I was too scared to tell you the truth.

587
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:20,679
Still, you should've told me.

588
00:52:20,762 --> 00:52:24,099
If you did, you wouldn't have been put
in danger by Gong Gi-cheol.

589
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:26,560
Do you know how scared I was that day?

590
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:31,147
Do you know how much I regretted…

591
00:52:32,941 --> 00:52:34,568
and blamed myself?

592
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:38,613
I promised that I'd protect you.

593
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:40,282
But I couldn't do anything.

594
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:44,286
I felt so pathetic. It drove me crazy.

595
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:59,634
I think it's only right that I take
responsibility for my actions.

596
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:05,390
Let's break up.

597
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:12,480
You want to break up?

598
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:15,525
I can't stay and keep bringing you harm.

599
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:17,986
I know you tried to force
the case closed with my statement.

600
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:19,946
That doesn't bother me at all.

601
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:20,864
But I'm…

602
00:53:20,947 --> 00:53:22,574
I'm not okay with it.

603
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:25,201
I don't want to stay

604
00:53:25,952 --> 00:53:29,205
and burden you with my situation.

605
00:53:36,212 --> 00:53:37,380
Then, what about me?

606
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:43,053
I've never liked anyone like this before.

607
00:53:44,137 --> 00:53:45,889
What will you do about my feelings?

608
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:02,405
I'll go now.

609
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:47,594
A tip?

610
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:49,304
What tip?

611
00:55:50,555 --> 00:55:52,140
Come on, Mr. Cha.

612
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:55,185
I heard the crucial factor

613
00:55:55,268 --> 00:55:58,813
in catching the killer
was senior public intern, Lim Sun.

614
00:55:58,897 --> 00:56:01,316
There was a lot of talk of that
at the police station too.

615
00:56:01,941 --> 00:56:02,817
Come on.

616
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:04,903
In any case, she's already quit.

617
00:56:04,986 --> 00:56:07,447
Nothing good can come
from stirring things up.

618
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:08,406
Still,

619
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:10,950
I can't write about things
that didn't happen.

620
00:56:12,368 --> 00:56:15,288
Not speaking about what did happen

621
00:56:15,371 --> 00:56:17,290
wouldn't cause problems though, right?

622
00:56:17,373 --> 00:56:18,792
Yes, come in.

623
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:21,753
What? Aren't you Ko Won?

624
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:24,964
Wow, I can't believe
I get to meet you here.

625
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:26,549
Can I shake your hand?

626
00:56:27,425 --> 00:56:28,468
I'm a fan.

627
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:31,721
Wait a second!

628
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:35,016
Wasn't Lim Sun the person
who saved you on your first day here?

629
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:39,771
-You may go.
-Can I get an interview?

630
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:41,481
It'll just take a second.

631
00:56:42,148 --> 00:56:46,027
Why feel the need to discuss things
if one doesn't want to?

632
00:56:46,694 --> 00:56:49,072
-It's just as Mr. Cha said.
-That's right.

633
00:56:51,407 --> 00:56:52,242
I'll be on my way.

634
00:56:52,325 --> 00:56:53,952
-Excuse me.
-Sure.

635
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:56,913
Come on.

636
00:56:56,996 --> 00:56:59,290
-Come here.
-I almost had a good story.

637
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:02,085
Look.

638
00:57:02,168 --> 00:57:04,045
What's on the indictment
is all that happened.

639
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:05,839
There's nothing more.

640
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:07,215
Nothing.

641
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:10,510
WITNESS STATEMENT
KO WON

642
00:57:12,512 --> 00:57:13,721
So you're saying

643
00:57:13,805 --> 00:57:17,350
the victim Lim Sun has the same name
as our former senior intern?

644
00:57:17,433 --> 00:57:18,434
No, wait.

645
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:20,311
They're the same person… No.

646
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:22,397
-So--
-No, wait!

647
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:25,442
So Lim Sun lied
about her identity to work here.

648
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:27,485
He wants to take all that out, right?

649
00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:28,403
Yes, sir.

650
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:31,156
That little punk.

651
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:32,240
So,

652
00:57:32,907 --> 00:57:36,453
the fake Lim Sun disgraced the prosecution
by conning us to get hired.

653
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:38,246
And if we don't stay quiet,

654
00:57:38,329 --> 00:57:42,459
Gye Ji-ung will reveal
not only did the fake Lim Sun deceive us

655
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:45,879
but she also caught the criminal
by herself, making us look like fools?

656
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:46,796
Yes, sir.

657
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,298
That little punk!

658
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,800
He is so stubborn.

659
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:53,803
Damn it.

660
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:55,305
Mr. Cha,

661
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:58,224
Gye Ji-ung will be called up
to Seoul soon.

662
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:00,643
He's leaving?

663
00:58:05,231 --> 00:58:06,941
Proceed with the indictment as is.

664
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:08,485
What?

665
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:10,653
Just do as Gye Ji-ung says!

666
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:11,863
All right, now!

667
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:14,282
He wants it covered up. Do it.

668
00:58:14,365 --> 00:58:15,450
Mr. Cha.

669
00:58:15,533 --> 00:58:17,160
-All right, now!
-Mr. Cha!

670
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:21,998
I need to send that punk away quickly.

671
00:58:22,081 --> 00:58:23,875
I'm so sick of him.

672
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:46,940
Drink this too.

673
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:55,031
By the way,

674
00:58:56,324 --> 00:58:57,575
I still can't reach

675
00:58:58,201 --> 00:58:59,202
the kid's mom.

676
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:07,877
They found her.

677
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:11,005
They did?

678
00:59:12,131 --> 00:59:12,966
Yes.

679
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:14,467
Goodness, hold on.

680
00:59:15,134 --> 00:59:16,427
Good grief.

681
00:59:16,511 --> 00:59:18,721
-What's wrong?
-Let go. I need to leave.

682
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:20,557
You can't go anywhere in your condition.

683
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,934
I have to let her son know.

684
00:59:23,643 --> 00:59:24,519
That little punk.

685
00:59:24,602 --> 00:59:27,564
He furiously begged me every day
to find his mother.

686
00:59:27,647 --> 00:59:29,440
I should hurry and let him know.

687
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:31,609
He'll love it.

688
00:59:31,693 --> 00:59:33,027
Wait a second.

689
00:59:33,611 --> 00:59:34,779
I'll take these too

690
00:59:35,488 --> 00:59:36,656
and give them to him.

691
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:43,037
Thank you!

692
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:08,021
Honey.

693
01:00:08,646 --> 01:00:10,106
You have to eat something.

694
01:00:12,692 --> 01:00:14,694
The living have to keep on living.

695
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:16,237
You can't starve to death.

696
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:24,037
They called us
and said they identified Sun.

697
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:28,666
All that was left were bones.
How could that be Sun?

698
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:29,584
How?

699
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:33,087
Do you remember?

700
01:00:33,671 --> 01:00:36,090
Sun was in such good health.

701
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:37,634
She was smart too.

702
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:39,719
So how can you say

703
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:41,888
that was Sun?

704
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:43,056
No, it's not her.

705
01:00:43,723 --> 01:00:44,849
It doesn't make sense.

706
01:00:45,933 --> 01:00:47,560
She grew up without her parents.

707
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:50,813
Our poor Sun grew up without their love.

708
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:52,565
I did all I could to raise her.

709
01:00:53,524 --> 01:00:55,193
You know that.

710
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:58,446
But all they brought back
were those thin bones.

711
01:00:58,529 --> 01:01:01,783
How is that Sun? How?

712
01:01:03,618 --> 01:01:05,078
No, it can't be.

713
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:09,290
I can't just sit here.

714
01:01:09,374 --> 01:01:10,291
What is it?

715
01:01:10,375 --> 01:01:12,168
Honey, I have to see Mr. Gye.

716
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:14,420
Last time at the station,

717
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:16,089
I'm sure he said it was Sun.

718
01:01:16,881 --> 01:01:17,799
I have to go.

719
01:01:17,882 --> 01:01:19,175
-Let's go.
-Honey.

720
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:20,510
Jeez!

721
01:01:23,054 --> 01:01:23,888
Mom.

722
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:27,141
Don't go.

723
01:01:28,309 --> 01:01:29,143
You.

724
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:33,856
You…

725
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:37,235
You're Sun, right?

726
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:40,446
Are you Sun?

727
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:41,364
Honey.

728
01:01:41,447 --> 01:01:43,282
Wait a second, honey.

729
01:01:44,075 --> 01:01:45,243
You're Sun, aren't you?

730
01:01:45,827 --> 01:01:46,869
Right?

731
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:53,376
Sun.

732
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:55,670
You're her, aren't you?

733
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:58,172
Right, Sun?

734
01:01:58,256 --> 01:02:01,050
See, honey! I told you Sun was alive.

735
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:03,553
She's standing right here alive.
She's not dead!

736
01:02:03,636 --> 01:02:04,470
Sun.

737
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:06,931
Where have you been all this time?

738
01:02:07,014 --> 01:02:09,976
Where were you?
You've been doing okay, right?

739
01:02:10,601 --> 01:02:13,896
You came because you missed me,
but I didn't recognize you.

740
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:16,399
I kept kicking you out
and chasing you away.

741
01:02:16,482 --> 01:02:17,358
I'm so sorry.

742
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:18,568
I'm sorry.

743
01:02:18,651 --> 01:02:20,403
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.

744
01:02:20,486 --> 01:02:21,821
I'm not Aunt Sun.

745
01:02:23,781 --> 01:02:24,949
I'm Mi-jin.

746
01:02:26,617 --> 01:02:27,994
What are you talking about?

747
01:02:28,494 --> 01:02:31,789
What is it?
Are you mad I didn't recognize you?

748
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:32,832
I'm so sorry.

749
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:34,625
I'm really sorry.

750
01:02:35,501 --> 01:02:37,253
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.

751
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,297
I'm sorry, Sun.

752
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:42,341
Gosh, Mom.

753
01:02:52,393 --> 01:02:54,061
Sun.

754
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:56,606
I'm so sorry.

755
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:07,867
Dad.

756
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:23,132
Mi-jin?

757
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:24,342
What?

758
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:35,853
-You…
-Mi-jin?

759
01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:16,853
MISS NIGHT AND DAY

760
01:04:16,936 --> 01:04:19,897
I didn't know just how much I liked…

761
01:04:19,981 --> 01:04:23,192
I only realized after it was gone.

762
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:26,445
What do you mean "farewell"?
Farewell?

763
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:29,740
I have to do whatever I can
to return to my original state.

764
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:32,410
For my mom and dad.

765
01:04:33,077 --> 01:04:36,497
Thanks to you,
I know what I want to do now.

766
01:04:38,457 --> 01:04:39,417
I'll get going.

767
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:43,588
Do you think I can be brave again?

768
01:04:45,298 --> 01:04:47,592
You were able to do it because it was you.

769
01:04:48,217 --> 01:04:50,219
Only you could've done it.

770
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:59,020
