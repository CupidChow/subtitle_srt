1
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:45,962
MISS NIGHT AND DAY

2
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:54,053
Do you know you're really strange?

3
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:55,847
You show up late, ask strange questions,

4
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,932
and tell me not to misunderstand

5
00:00:58,016 --> 00:00:59,517
despite giving mixed messages.

6
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:02,896
Then, you apologize for no reason.
What's wrong with you?

7
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:05,732
I think you're misunderstanding
what I'm saying right now.

8
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:07,233
I'm not misunderstanding you!

9
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,652
-That's not what I meant--
-I promise I won't.

10
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,112
I know how you feel now,

11
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,030
so you can go.

12
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:03,873
Could you look up
the registration for this car?

13
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:11,131
I don't know!

14
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:13,341
It's my first time, so I don't know.

15
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,010
I just really like someone,

16
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:18,847
but I'm worried to death
that something might happen to her.

17
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,307
I'm restless.
I can't get anything done all day.

18
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:25,436
I'm so preoccupied
that I even forget to take my pills.

19
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:27,272
I've never felt this way before.

20
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:37,782
About who?

21
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:41,744
You.

22
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:07,770
SEOHAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

23
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:13,026
PROSECUTOR GYE JI-UNG

24
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,368
Mr. Gye called in sick today.

25
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:23,620
He's sick?

26
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:24,704
What does he have?

27
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:26,539
How sick is he?

28
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:32,795
He doesn't miss a day of work
and comes in at the crack of dawn.

29
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,005
It's just surprising.

30
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,550
But it's not very serious, is it?

31
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:41,512
Well, he usually takes care of himself,
but he's come down with a nasty cold.

32
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,264
Let's not think about it.

33
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,308
He has nothing to do with me.

34
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:47,685
But I can't just rest.

35
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,145
Damn, it's so annoying.

36
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,230
Excuse me?

37
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:53,441
I was talking to myself.

38
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,236
It was about someone else
and not worrying about them.

39
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:58,571
Who?

40
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,785
Whether it's this guy or that,
don't worry about them.

41
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,707
Go! What are you doing?

42
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,961
-What are you doing?
-Nothing. The sun is so bright.

43
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:14,671
We need some blinds.

44
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:17,423
I know how that feels.

45
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:20,051
You don't want to think about it,
but it bothers you.

46
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:22,387
The more you try not to think about it,
the more you do.

47
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,515
You feel restless and crazy all day.
You can't do anything.

48
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:30,353
I know how that feels too.

49
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,940
Because that's how I feel right now.

50
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:40,029
Even when I tell myself to stop, I can't.

51
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:43,116
I know it won't happen,
but I can't help it.

52
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:47,036
I can't even control myself,
so how could I tell you to do the same?

53
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:20,945
PHARMACY

54
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:25,616
He usually takes care of himself,
but he's come down with a nasty cold.

55
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,828
What's wrong with me?
I said I wouldn't think about it.

56
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:30,955
Just go.

57
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:33,333
Start pedaling.

58
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,294
There's no need for that.

59
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:39,464
There's no misunderstanding,
so don't worry.

60
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:43,426
And not because
you don't want to misunderstand?

61
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,263
He doesn't deserve it.

62
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,640
Serves him right.

63
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:50,558
Jeez.

64
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:54,937
Here you go.

65
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,315
-Two pills after meals, right?
-Thank you.

66
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,484
Lee Ja-yeon? Okay.

67
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,613
You have no pride, Mi-jin.

68
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,956
Don't get off the bike.

69
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:18,628
Why did I get off?

70
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,004
I don't like rice porridge.

71
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,007
Darn it.

72
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,141
My goodness!

73
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:35,561
Damn! That scared me!

74
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,688
But why am I running away?

75
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,690
I didn't even do anything wrong.

76
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:41,984
Damn it.

77
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:50,076
You know, without Mr. Gye at the office,
it's so quiet and peaceful.

78
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,119
It feels so…

79
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,122
empty.

80
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,624
-Excuse me, ma'am.
-Yes?

81
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:58,376
When someone who rarely gets sick

82
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:01,337
catches a nasty cold
and has to be in bed for days,

83
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:05,049
I'd like a porridge that will help him
bounce back, and make it to go, please.

84
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:09,887
I'm home.

85
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:14,934
What's this smell?

86
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:18,438
Wow, it smells so good.

87
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,022
Mom, I'm home.

88
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,190
-Hey.
-Hi.

89
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:24,652
Wow, look how milky white
that ox knee soup is.

90
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:26,571
Mom, is this the most premium grade?

91
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:27,488
Yeah.

92
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,532
If someone was suffering from a cold,

93
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,493
I bet a bowl of this
would cure them right away.

94
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,078
What? Is someone sick?

95
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,415
No, I'm just saying.

96
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:38,958
-Ms. Lim.
-Yeah?

97
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,835
-Is it done?
-What was that?

98
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:42,044
Are you "Ms. Lim" too?

99
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,506
Well, Mom's busy,
so I just answered for her.

100
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,467
-Our girl's so sweet.
-Yeah.

101
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,010
Wash your hands for dinner.

102
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:52,638
It's been so long since you made
something this nourishing.

103
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,390
I better wash up fast and dig in.

104
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:03,084
That's all of it.

105
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:19,642
-Hey.
-Did you give it to him?

106
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:21,269
No, not yet.

107
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:23,563
Should I just leave it here?

108
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:26,399
I said just go in and give it to him.

109
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:28,109
-You're so frustrating.
-Go in?

110
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:29,944
I'm on my way out, so I'll come down.

111
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:33,197
What in the world?

112
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:34,240
Hey.

113
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:36,325
My contact lens fell out.

114
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,035
Why would I go inside?

115
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:44,750
Ms. Lee Mi-jin?

116
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:46,836
-Hello.
-Hello.

117
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,755
I was dropping by because Mr. Gye's sick.

118
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,924
-I see.
-Wow, I'm cluelessly interrupting!

119
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,010
I only dropped by
on the way to my friend's house.

120
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,177
I was about to go up.

121
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,304
I'm sure you were.

122
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:57,680
Enjoy your visit.

123
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:58,598
Wait a moment.

124
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:01,350
No, wait…

125
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,560
Give him this for me.

126
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:04,312
Did you make all those yourself?

127
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:06,188
-I did, but--
-What's that?

128
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,941
This is ox knee soup.
Can you give this to him…

129
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:14,280
What brings you here?

130
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:16,282
I didn't press the bell.

131
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:18,868
Are you okay?

132
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:20,328
Go in…

133
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:21,829
Let's go inside.

134
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:31,839
Wow. He's got good sense.

135
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:38,804
DOGAVILL STUDIO APARTMENT

136
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:17,385
He's so dazzling.

137
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:23,766
Incredible.

138
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,144
Gosh, it's cold.

139
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,938
Now, where should I go tonight?

140
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:32,983
Wow.

141
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:34,693
He's so cool.

142
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:40,783
What?

143
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,789
What is this?

144
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,298
You haven't eaten anything?

145
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,761
I took medicine, so I'll be fine.

146
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:04,432
You can't take medicine
on an empty stomach.

147
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,142
It's fine.

148
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:21,449
I should reheat this.

149
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:26,745
Hot.

150
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:28,664
That's hot.

151
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:04,742
Here.

152
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,497
Is that for me?

153
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:18,797
I guess you like it.

154
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:43,447
What's this?

155
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:50,246
Where did all the side dishes go?

156
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:59,004
Honey!

157
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:00,798
Come out here!

158
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:03,175
What? What is it?

159
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:07,346
-What?
-That crazy lady must've been here again!

160
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:08,889
What?!

161
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,182
I don't believe this!

162
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,935
Where is she? Where?

163
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:15,854
All the food
from the refrigerator is gone!

164
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,359
-No, it wasn't her.
-What do you mean?

165
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:23,237
She even stole every drop of soup I made!

166
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,114
It went to our future son-in-law.

167
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,032
What did you say?

168
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:01,442
I prepared your meal,
so make sure you eat.

169
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,249
Don't go.

170
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,166
My mom…

171
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,503
said she'd come back.

172
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:26,402
-Mom?
-Hey, you were still awake?

173
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,028
Yeah, I was waiting for you.

174
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,531
I told you I'd be late tonight.
Go to bed now.

175
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:33,075
They said the first snow
of the season's falling tonight.

176
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,952
No wonder it's been so cold.

177
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:36,954
How about we make a snowman?

178
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,038
Really?

179
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:39,873
Really.

180
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,750
You really promise?

181
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,168
I really promise.

182
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,628
I'll be home soon.

183
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,422
-Hurry home.
-Go to bed now.

184
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:47,881
Okay.

185
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,426
That was the last time.

186
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,849
That promise my mom made with me

187
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,144
was the first and last one.

188
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,817
Why was it the last one?

189
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:10,696
She disappeared.

190
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,036
Everyone told me she died.

191
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,249
Or they said she ran away.

192
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,045
Maybe I wanted to believe it.

193
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,549
I didn't want that promise to be a lie.

194
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:38,849
That's why I came here to Seohan.

195
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:13,967
So cool.

196
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:24,561
What in the world was that?

197
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:29,983
You're still up?

198
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:34,321
What? What's wrong?

199
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:39,701
Who was that person
who helped you downstairs earlier?

200
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,079
The investigator?

201
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:43,330
The investigator!

202
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:45,582
So that's why he had
such a fierce presence.

203
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,585
-Had what?
-He looked just like Ko Won.

204
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:49,503
Like who?

205
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,592
By the way, what's going on
with you and Ko Won?

206
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,387
Nothing's going on.

207
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:00,264
If nothing's going on,

208
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:02,724
why would he help find the cat?
He always rebuffs girls.

209
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,395
No way. Did Ko Won ask you--

210
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:07,813
I saved his life.

211
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:10,858
He's just helping me
look for the cat in order to repay me.

212
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:13,360
Nothing's going on. It never will.

213
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:16,697
I thought you had something on him
and were exploiting him.

214
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,740
But is something the matter with him?

215
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,325
He's so depressed right now.

216
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:21,451
It's like he was dumped.

217
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,537
Come on! He wasn't dumped!

218
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,586
I mean,

219
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,839
there's no way a star like him
would be dumped.

220
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:41,096
It's… ridiculous.

221
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:45,100
You've finally realized
just how precious Ko Won is.

222
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:46,977
But no thanks.

223
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,813
Because just my love is enough for Ko Won.

224
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:52,274
Wow! He's so handsome.

225
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,318
I'm going to bed.

226
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,487
-I'm turning off the lights.
-Okay.

227
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,898
If Mr. Gye's mom disappeared…

228
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:18,694
If instead of running away,

229
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:22,197
she really disappeared…

230
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:31,915
does that mean Aunt Sun disappeared too?

231
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:43,552
That tiny elf we met
at the pig's trotters place

232
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,095
is the investigator?

233
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:46,555
I told you.

234
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,515
No way!

235
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:50,225
But he looked just like Ko Won.

236
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,602
That's how he looked in my eyes.

237
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:56,023
You didn't wear your contacts, did you?

238
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:56,940
No, they fell out.

239
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:58,984
Always wear them.
You're asking for trouble.

240
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,112
My Ko Won!

241
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,740
My gosh, I don't believe this!

242
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:06,658
-No way!
-Bye.

243
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:08,827
This can't be true.

244
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,038
That little elf's really Ko Won? Damn it!

245
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,084
This is ridiculous!
How could he be Ko Won?

246
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,669
My Ko Won!

247
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:21,882
Come in.

248
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:36,980
You work on the fourth floor.
Why are you always here?

249
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:40,317
It's uncomfortable for us.

250
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:02,214
Yes, I'll bring down
the files you mentioned.

251
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:03,965
Okay.

252
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:15,560
Did you know too, Mr. Gye?

253
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:16,895
Know what?

254
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:18,647
About Ko Won.

255
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,315
I thought you knew.

256
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:22,526
Know what about him?

257
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,654
About the person he likes.

258
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:33,954
So you did know.

259
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:39,543
The feelings are mutual,
so how can you stop them, right?

260
00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:41,586
They're mutual?

261
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:46,758
Yes, I thought it was one-sided at first,
but it seems to have become mutual.

262
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,135
-It's sweet.
-Drink.

263
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:49,761
So make sure to take them.

264
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:57,102
Come on.

265
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,062
-Hey.
-Let's go.

266
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:00,188
-Wait.
-Come on, let's go.

267
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,107
-Ms. Lim.
-What's with you?

268
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,567
See? I knew you'd get in.

269
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:05,944
Watch your head.

270
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,825
I don't know!

271
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:14,035
It's my first time, so I don't know.

272
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:17,038
I'm so preoccupied
that I even forget to take my pills.

273
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:18,915
I've never felt this way before.

274
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:28,633
Are you okay?

275
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,635
She's really dating Ko Won?

276
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,137
At first,

277
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:35,098
I didn't think it was right either.

278
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,476
But I'll support them now.

279
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,437
Why would you support them?

280
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:43,023
To be frank, love isn't a crime.

281
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:51,865
What about the vehicle
I asked you to look up?

282
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:54,326
I checked. It's an unregistered vehicle.

283
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:56,745
Why are you telling me this just now?

284
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:58,788
You should've told me right away!

285
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:00,957
Do I always have to ask first?

286
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,668
What do you do all day?

287
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:05,337
Jeez!

288
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:11,301
Yeah, at first…

289
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,346
I'm sure it'll be hard to accept.

290
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:15,847
Yeah, I understand.

291
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:18,183
I was like that too.

292
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:27,108
Hello, Detective Kwon?
Where's Baek Cheol-gyu right now?

293
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:28,818
Hello, Mr. Gye.

294
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:31,279
He's hiding in the hospital
and hasn't come out.

295
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:33,448
Are you sure he's inside?

296
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:35,784
I'm sure he's roaming around
somewhere inside.

297
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,411
Does he even go home?

298
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:40,413
He hasn't gone anywhere.

299
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:43,416
I'm sure he's inside the hospital.

300
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:47,212
Okay, keep an eye on him.

301
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:58,640
Yeah, the car with plate number
ending in 2953 drove off.

302
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,600
What should I do? Should I stay here?

303
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:01,977
Okay.

304
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:07,649
What's this?

305
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:16,032
Why is Gye poking his nose
in everywhere? Damn it.

306
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:19,703
Hello. Thanks for your hard work.

307
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:20,620
Yeah.

308
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:23,123
-Is the dashcam on this car on?
-Yeah.

309
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:27,752
When did the black van parked here
with plate number 2953 leave?

310
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:30,088
It left about an hour ago.

311
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:31,214
An hour ago?

312
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:36,553
Look, I'm only doing this
because Detective Kwon begged me to,

313
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:39,055
but it's not like I'm on night watch duty.

314
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:41,349
Will the culprit even show up
if I stay here?

315
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,727
I know it's difficult,

316
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,395
but this is very important.

317
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:46,980
I'd appreciate your help.

318
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:57,115
Why is he suddenly being so respectful?

319
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,707
What's the problem here?

320
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,377
It just comes and goes.

321
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:10,920
Jeez.

322
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:42,660
Lim Sun's place of residence is Dogavill.

323
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:44,788
But take a look.

324
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:08,478
Instead of going home,
she went to a different house.

325
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:15,110
After following her for a few days,
I found that she went to that house often.

326
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:24,077
But the strange thing is…

327
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:32,710
whenever I'd lose sight of Lim Sun,

328
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:34,879
a young woman would appear.

329
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:35,797
I'm home.

330
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:41,136
I looked into it.

331
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:44,055
It turns out the house belongs
to Lim Sun's older sister.

332
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:46,891
And the young woman is Lim Sun's niece.

333
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:07,662
As you can see,

334
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,873
she meets with her niece behind the house.

335
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:11,374
I don't know why.

336
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:13,460
But they don't go in together.

337
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:16,171
What do they do when they meet?

338
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,214
I haven't found that out yet.

339
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:20,425
They move so quickly.

340
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:22,343
Any pictures of them together?

341
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:23,303
None.

342
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:25,346
They move separately.

343
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,558
Lim Sun disappears
without a trace after work,

344
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:31,311
and Lee Mi-jin only moves
after Lim Sun gets off work.

345
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:35,774
I'm sure the two of them
are up to something.

346
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,653
Here's information on her niece.

347
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:45,283
RÉSUMÉ
LEE MI-JIN

348
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:49,287
Are you sure Lim Sun
is that the same woman from 24 years ago?

349
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,792
We should check for ourselves.

350
00:29:57,504 --> 00:30:02,383
Season the bean sprouts well

351
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:06,179
Hey, by the way…

352
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:07,722
What?

353
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:11,976
I mean, well…

354
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,603
What is it?

355
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:15,897
Look at these bean sprouts!

356
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,191
They're nice and firm.

357
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:19,359
How nice.

358
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:26,908
What?

359
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:29,160
Madame Kwak.

360
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:31,663
Did you hear she's selling her shop?

361
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:33,414
Have you lost it?

362
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:36,000
Why would you suddenly bring that up?

363
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,085
Be quiet!

364
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,130
I mean, I just thought
you'd be worried about it.

365
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:43,091
-Stop!
-I barely managed to find out.

366
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:45,718
Forget it then! Jeez, you're unbelievable.

367
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:49,305
Absolutely ridiculous.
I did it for you and you chew me out.

368
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:55,103
Where was her shop?

369
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:58,606
At the intersection of--

370
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,732
You scared me!

371
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:01,818
Gosh!

372
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:06,072
When did you get back, Cheong? Goodness.

373
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:07,240
I was just…

374
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:09,409
We weren't talking about anything.
We just--

375
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:10,451
Shut up!

376
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,664
We did nothing wrong!
Why are you making excuses?

377
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:16,249
Yeah!

378
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:19,002
Yeah, that's right.
There's no need to make excuses.

379
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:20,795
Wow.

380
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,841
Goodness. Why would you
roll up your sleeves?

381
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:25,925
It's so chilly.

382
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:27,468
Don't do this.

383
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:28,928
Use your words.

384
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,984
RECENTS
DOCUMENTS

385
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:46,070
Should I ask her to come out?

386
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:51,618
That hurts!

387
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:56,539
-I have plans. I should go.
-Right.

388
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:58,041
Where do you think you're going?

389
00:31:58,124 --> 00:32:00,460
-Where are you going?
-What's going on?

390
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:01,544
I'll teach you to…

391
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:06,758
Goodness.

392
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:09,218
What brings you here, Mr. Gye?

393
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:12,305
Well, I came in because I heard screams.

394
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:13,640
I'll be on my way.

395
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:15,099
-Don't go!
-Don't go!

396
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:17,977
You seem very busy, so--

397
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:21,230
-No! Come in.
-No! Please come inside!

398
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:22,523
Come on in.

399
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:24,025
This is what we do for fun.

400
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:28,196
Honey, shall we clean up now?
You help too, Pyeon-gang.

401
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:36,037
Goodness, I can't believe
I finally get a chance

402
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,873
to serve you
my precious homemade quince tea.

403
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:40,333
Thank you.

404
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:44,462
We should share
this precious tea with everyone.

405
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:52,637
It's all yours.

406
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:56,391
-Please have some.
-Okay, thank you.

407
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:59,519
Thank you.

408
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:04,899
Goodness, thank you.

409
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:12,448
By the way, how do you two
know each other?

410
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:15,368
I'm one of his tenants.

411
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:16,744
A tenant?

412
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:19,372
I see. For which place?

413
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:25,003
You know, the one over there…

414
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:26,254
What did you say?

415
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,172
So which place?

416
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:30,425
Dogavill.

417
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:31,467
I see.

418
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:34,429
Where Ga-yeong lives?
There must've been an empty unit.

419
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:37,849
Tell her the truth.

420
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:41,811
Apartment 303…

421
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:42,854
Where?

422
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:47,483
Apartment 303.

423
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:49,152
Are you crazy? That haunted…

424
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:54,365
How could you put that unit up for rent?

425
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:59,662
I mean, I was going to
give him a discount.

426
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:02,457
Starting this month,

427
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:05,209
just pay half the rent.

428
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:06,711
All of a sudden?

429
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:07,837
Yeah.

430
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:13,426
I wanted to be a really good landlord.

431
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:15,136
All of a sudden.

432
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:26,481
Hey, did something happen
to Director Baek?

433
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:28,858
He hasn't come in to work for days now.

434
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:30,401
He must be busy.

435
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,653
Jeez, is that all you can say?

436
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,697
He's a colleague. Aren't you worried?

437
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:37,075
He's my colleague too.

438
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:39,535
I've already called him.

439
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:42,497
He won't pick up or text back.

440
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:45,124
Still, this isn't normal, right?

441
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:47,085
Shouldn't we go by his place?

442
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:51,672
Remember how we lost contact
with Ko Na-heun, and then…

443
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:54,509
And then, look what happened to him.

444
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,927
Good grief.

445
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,929
You still think you're a detective?

446
00:34:58,554 --> 00:34:59,972
Director Baek is different.

447
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:02,892
Unlike us, he has somewhere to go
if he quits this job.

448
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:06,813
He used to be a director
of a hospital, so he's well-off.

449
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:10,983
We knew he wouldn't stay long
as a senior public intern.

450
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:12,318
I know that, but…

451
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:14,487
I'd be out having fun too if I were rich.

452
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:17,782
Just hurry up and clean.

453
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:21,327
Gosh.

454
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:26,874
What?

455
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,509
I'm home.

456
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:40,721
Hey!

457
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:44,809
Hello.

458
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,270
Mr. Gye.

459
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:48,813
I told you to stay seated.

460
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:49,814
Yes, ma'am.

461
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:51,399
-Hey.
-Hi.

462
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:56,195
Go wash your hands. Dinner's ready.

463
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:58,573
What's going on?

464
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:02,368
-I think it's your engagement dinner.
-I'll kill you.

465
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,620
Why is there so much?

466
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:06,289
Dad, where should I put this?

467
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:07,623
-Here.
-Put it here.

468
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:09,333
-Ga-yeong.
-Yes, Mom?

469
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:10,501
-Sit down.
-Yes, sir.

470
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:11,586
Take a seat.

471
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:12,795
Sit.

472
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:15,131
It's not time for alcohol yet.

473
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:16,716
Do you like it mixed or straight?

474
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:20,344
What in the world are they doing?

475
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:24,182
Mi-jin, don't you ever fix
your makeup at work?

476
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:25,266
You try growing old.

477
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:26,809
-Makeup is suffocating.
-Wait.

478
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:28,686
Look at these bags and your greasy skin.

479
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:31,063
-Is it that bad?
-Yeah. Sit down for a second.

480
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:34,192
I'll make it look natural. Lips.

481
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:36,360
What if my parents
start saying weird things?

482
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:37,904
Don't worry. I'll be your defense.

483
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:39,071
-Okay.
-Lips.

484
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:40,573
-Will they ask weird things?
-No.

485
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:42,533
Even if they do, I have your back.

486
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:44,452
-Okay.
-Don't worry. Wait!

487
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:45,661
Your greasy face.

488
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:47,705
-Greasy face?
-Why are you so greasy?

489
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:49,248
Smile. You'll get wrinkles.

490
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:51,125
-I'll trust you.
-Yeah.

491
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,793
-Seriously. I'm counting on you.
-Okay.

492
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:54,378
Okay.

493
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:57,548
This is what we usually have for dinner.

494
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:58,799
A simple meal.

495
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:02,094
Now, let's eat.

496
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:05,264
-Please enjoy! Thank you!
-Thank you for the meal!

497
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:06,766
Mr. Gye, eat up.

498
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:08,184
I will. Thank you.

499
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:11,020
Ga-yeong, take some side dishes
with you when you go.

500
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:13,606
Okay, Mom. Nice! I was out of kimchi too.

501
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:16,192
That's right.

502
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:21,072
I made some great ox knee soup yesterday.

503
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:23,074
But someone ran off with it.

504
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:25,034
Gosh, I should've given you that.

505
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:26,577
What a waste.

506
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:32,291
Are you okay?

507
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,419
Eat slowly.

508
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:39,090
All right. The japchae's good.

509
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:40,841
But is today a special day?

510
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,432
Goodness, I almost forgot.

511
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,101
I need to bring the yellow corvina.

512
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:51,644
Keep eating.

513
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:55,856
What? What's the matter?

514
00:37:57,525 --> 00:38:00,236
It's your aunt's birthday today.

515
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:06,075
Then, should we wait
until she gets here before we eat?

516
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:11,455
Actually, my wife's--

517
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:13,207
Mr. Lee, here.

518
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,375
Have a drink.

519
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,544
-Let me pour it for you.
-Should I?

520
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:17,878
How's work, Ga-yeong?

521
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:18,838
Yes, of course.

522
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:20,756
I got 50,000 more subscribers.

523
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,759
I don't know what that means,
but it sounds good.

524
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:25,386
Subscribers for my channel.

525
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:27,305
I create beauty videos.

526
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:28,222
Right.

527
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:30,933
Actually, my wife's--

528
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:33,227
-Mr. Lee!
-What?

529
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:34,854
I think you've had too many drinks.

530
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:37,231
-I only had one shot.
-It must be the fine dust.

531
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,150
But why is your face so red?

532
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:40,443
-Am I red already?
-Yeah.

533
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:41,861
But I usually drink two bottles.

534
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:45,031
That's right. It was two bottles.

535
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:48,868
That's why I secretly brought
some imported liquor for you.

536
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:50,328
What imported liquor?

537
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:52,955
It's from a sponsorship. Don't tell Mom.

538
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,123
Come here, Mr. Lee.

539
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:55,082
-Hurry.
-Really?

540
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,417
-Yeah.
-What about me?

541
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,585
I'll give you some later.

542
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:58,961
-What about me?
-Just wait, Dad.

543
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:00,046
Mr. Lee, come on.

544
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,275
Mom, are you okay?

545
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:25,237
It's nothing. I'm fine.

546
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:27,907
It's already been years.

547
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:32,703
I'm sorry I forgot.

548
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:38,209
These yellow corvina were Sun's favorite,

549
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:40,503
and I was never able to make this for her.

550
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:46,425
She'll come back.

551
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:49,470
I know she will.

552
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:56,685
I'm sorry.

553
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:07,071
Goodness.

554
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:08,823
Let's get back to eating.

555
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,367
To tell you the truth,

556
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:13,786
this family has a heart-wrenching story--

557
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:15,913
-Dad!
-My goodness!

558
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:17,540
What?

559
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:18,958
You're drunk.

560
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:20,501
You've had too much to drink.

561
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:23,546
I didn't even have
one drink yet, you brat.

562
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:26,841
Then, instead of soju,

563
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:28,342
let's drink something expensive.

564
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:30,886
I have an expensive bottle
of liquor just for you.

565
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,555
-I'll give that to you.
-Liquor?

566
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:34,557
-Get up!
-Liquor all of a sudden?

567
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,766
I'll give you some! Come on.

568
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,017
Where are we going?

569
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,686
Should we go home? Come here.

570
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:39,770
-Go home?
-Yeah.

571
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:42,857
-I'll give it to you at home.
-We can't leave all that food here. Hey!

572
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:49,989
I didn't come for this though.
She gave me so much again.

573
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:52,658
How did you get dragged into this?

574
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:56,287
-I didn't. I walked in on my own.
-To see me?

575
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,497
Well, it's just…

576
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:02,042
I was just passing by,
and it happened by coincidence.

577
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,503
So you just happened to pass by here?

578
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:11,177
To be honest,
it's my aunt's birthday today.

579
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,929
The aunt you resemble?

580
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:14,847
Yes.

581
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,099
She's not here,

582
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,477
but we always celebrate her birthday.

583
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,895
She doesn't have a date of death.

584
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:22,563
If she doesn't have a…

585
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:25,107
I see.

586
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:26,775
Yes.

587
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:33,574
Hearing about your mother
reminded me of my aunt a lot.

588
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:39,622
I think maybe my mom feels the same…

589
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:44,960
and can't bring herself
to say goodbye to my aunt.

590
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:48,672
She has a sense of hope
that she might come back.

591
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:50,341
That's why.

592
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:06,148
There's something I didn't tell you.

593
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,780
-Yes?
-I have something to ask you.

594
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,242
Since you're a prosecutor,

595
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:18,202
I figured you'd know.

596
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:25,084
SEOHAN PROVINCIAL POLICE AGENCY
SUSPECT TO BE PROSECUTED FOR FRAUD

597
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:30,589
I don't think I should be
telling you about this.

598
00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:32,675
So you do know about it.

599
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:46,105
It's all my fault.

600
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:48,357
She was born to an incompetent dad.

601
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,026
Her mom pressured her

602
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:53,320
to get a civil service job
that doesn't even suit her,

603
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:54,738
and she suffered so much.

604
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:58,659
I just feel sorry for Mi-jin.

605
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:19,930
No.

606
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:22,391
You didn't do anything wrong.

607
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:23,559
It's all my fault.

608
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:43,912
Hey.

609
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:45,164
Did you see him out?

610
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:46,457
What are you doing, Dad?

611
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:48,334
I was just bored.

612
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:51,503
Have you been shining my shoes every day?

613
00:43:52,087 --> 00:43:54,256
Just every now and then.

614
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,424
Goodness.

615
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:16,153
Yeah?

616
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:17,613
Can I come in?

617
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:18,530
Yeah.

618
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:22,117
Were you going to bed?

619
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:23,160
No, not yet.

620
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:37,174
It's some money I had saved up.

621
00:44:37,257 --> 00:44:38,425
What is this?

622
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:41,387
I wanted to buy you an outfit
when you got a job.

623
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:42,763
Just use it however you like.

624
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:43,889
Dad, it's fine…

625
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:46,767
I can afford this much, okay?

626
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:48,519
Take it.

627
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:49,645
Don't tell your mom.

628
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:51,814
Today was hard, right?

629
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:53,524
No, I'm fine.

630
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:54,900
-Get some rest.
-Okay.

631
00:44:57,236 --> 00:44:58,779
-Mi-jin.
-Yeah?

632
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:00,114
You're doing great.

633
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:15,254
FROM DAD

634
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:00,716
SEOHAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

635
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:03,385
-Ms. Lim.
-Yes?

636
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:05,220
We got the search warrant for Hwadong.

637
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:06,346
What?

638
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:07,890
Let's go get Hwadong Medical Center.

639
00:46:07,973 --> 00:46:08,891
Yes, sir.

640
00:46:56,813 --> 00:46:59,566
Everyone, stop what you're doing.
We ask for your cooperation.

641
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,319
Hey! Stop!

642
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:04,363
We're from the prosecutors' office.

643
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:07,449
From this moment on,

644
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:09,451
we will conduct the search and seizure

645
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:10,577
of Hwadong Medical Center.

646
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:11,954
Everyone, freeze!

647
00:47:12,037 --> 00:47:13,455
Nobody move!

648
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:16,124
Please put everything
on their desks into the boxes.

649
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:26,885
Hwadong Medical Center?

650
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:31,265
Didn't Baek Cheol-gyu used to be
the director of that hospital?

651
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:32,891
Why would they search there?

652
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:36,812
It might not be an issue
with Director Baek.

653
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:38,397
Then, is it an internal issue?

654
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,733
Ask Lim Sun if you're that curious.

655
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:44,444
It looked like she went along
to help with the boxes.

656
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:46,822
I knew it.

657
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:50,075
She gets to work on serious cases
as an office assistant.

658
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:54,454
Some get to carry seized boxes,
and others get to carry mops.

659
00:47:55,247 --> 00:48:00,002
Jeez. At your age, you should be grateful
for the chance to even hold a mop.

660
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:01,545
What are you grumbling about?

661
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:04,214
Give it here if you don't want to work.

662
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:07,593
There are plenty of others out there
who are willing to work.

663
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:08,885
Who says I didn't want to?

664
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:15,475
Wait.

665
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:18,729
It couldn't be related
to Ko Na-heun's case, could it?

666
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:21,148
Who knows?

667
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:24,568
It's not like the lunatic has a sign
on their face saying they're crazy.

668
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:30,574
Once in a while,
those who you'd least expect

669
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:33,619
end up being the culprit.

670
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:41,376
I mean, I'm not saying that's true
about Ko Na-heun's case.

671
00:48:43,545 --> 00:48:44,379
Goodness.

672
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:49,343
Some people are mopping like crazy,
and others are fixing their makeup. Jeez.

673
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:51,637
Please have some drinks as you work.

674
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:52,971
Here you go.

675
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:53,889
Thank you.

676
00:48:55,557 --> 00:48:56,683
I'm sorry,

677
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:58,727
but can I check some security footage?

678
00:48:58,810 --> 00:48:59,978
-Security footage?
-Yes.

679
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:01,647
It's not allowed for security reasons.

680
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:04,900
Of course, not. I know it's not allowed,

681
00:49:04,983 --> 00:49:09,404
but someone keeps dumping trash
in front of the deputy chief's office.

682
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:11,198
-Mr. Cha's office?
-Yes.

683
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:13,325
He's very upset about it.

684
00:49:13,408 --> 00:49:16,036
Who would dare to do something like that?

685
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:17,746
-I know.
-How strange.

686
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:19,039
Let's take a look.

687
00:49:24,419 --> 00:49:26,588
It's a blind spot, so we can't see.

688
00:49:30,884 --> 00:49:31,760
Okay, then.

689
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:32,678
Thank you.

690
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:33,637
I appreciate it.

691
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,180
-Thanks for the drinks.
-Sure.

692
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:51,321
They came here in the middle of the day
to deliver the letter.

693
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:53,365
It's someone who works here.

694
00:50:05,585 --> 00:50:06,545
DIRECTOR BAEK CHEOL-GYU

695
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:37,617
What are you doing?

696
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:39,911
When I use my instincts to search…

697
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:44,249
There was a drawer here?

698
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:48,837
…I score big sometimes.

699
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:53,467
There's nothing here.

700
00:50:54,342 --> 00:50:56,136
The fierce presence Ga-yeong mentioned.

701
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:07,397
Are you okay?

702
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:12,027
I'll take care of this.

703
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:13,153
Can you take the boxes?

704
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:14,571
-The boxes? Okay.
-Yes.

705
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:23,371
Are you okay?

706
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:25,832
-Could you help me a little?
-Sure.

707
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:27,334
One, two…

708
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:34,299
-Tell me if you need help.
-Okay.

709
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:40,680
You should take your coat off.

710
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:41,973
No, it's fine.

711
00:51:45,393 --> 00:51:46,978
It's harder to carry the boxes.

712
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:50,482
Fierce presence, my foot.

713
00:51:56,988 --> 00:52:00,951
Yes, once the hospital records are done,
get a warrant for the director's house.

714
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:02,786
Okay, bye.

715
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:10,085
We need to talk.

716
00:52:20,136 --> 00:52:21,638
Why did you really come here?

717
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:23,265
Why?

718
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:31,690
People think you're here to take a break,
and I would've thought so too

719
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:34,401
if it weren't for my dad's intel.

720
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:38,572
What did your successful
law firm CEO father say?

721
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:39,865
You volunteered to come.

722
00:52:40,365 --> 00:52:41,575
But what's to gain here?

723
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:46,872
I thought about it after the case
was reassigned, and something was strange.

724
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:50,333
There are way more cases
to snatch up in Seoul than here,

725
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:54,004
so why would you come all the way here?

726
00:52:55,797 --> 00:52:56,715
Thanks for the drink.

727
00:52:56,798 --> 00:52:58,675
You didn't come to steal what's mine.

728
00:52:58,758 --> 00:52:59,885
You came here

729
00:53:01,052 --> 00:53:02,262
for my case.

730
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,599
I ended up in hot water because of that.

731
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:08,184
Thanks to my successful dad,

732
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:11,104
I can't sleep at night
when someone takes what's mine.

733
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:13,940
Just wait and see
what I take from you.

734
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:22,949
Jeez.

735
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:27,245
-I'll take care of that if you're done.
-It's fine.

736
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:28,747
-Let me.
-I'll throw it away.

737
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:30,123
Thank you, sir.

738
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:39,925
Gye Ji-ung?

739
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:43,261
Gye…

740
00:53:44,262 --> 00:53:45,138
No way.

741
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:52,604
Ms. Lim Sun?

742
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:56,650
Hello.

743
00:53:56,733 --> 00:54:00,028
I was very surprised when you disappeared
from the ER that day.

744
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:02,447
Right, sorry about that.

745
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:05,033
Something urgent came up that day.

746
00:54:05,116 --> 00:54:06,076
Excuse me.

747
00:54:06,159 --> 00:54:07,285
Just a moment.

748
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:10,080
Take your blood test results
while you're here.

749
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:13,833
-The results?
-Yes. This way, please.

750
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:31,643
Damn it.

751
00:54:38,733 --> 00:54:40,485
SEOHAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

752
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:42,904
Hello, Detective Kwon.

753
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:44,447
Hello, Mr. Gye.

754
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:46,574
I think Baek Cheol-gyu is onto us.

755
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:49,327
We don't know
if he's actually in the hospital.

756
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:50,578
What do you mean?

757
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:53,206
It was strange how he was
nowhere to be found during the raid.

758
00:54:53,289 --> 00:54:54,457
What about his car?

759
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:56,167
Well, his car's here.

760
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:58,128
It hasn't moved.

761
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:00,338
But gosh, this is…

762
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:01,423
it feels really off.

763
00:55:01,506 --> 00:55:03,633
Check the security footage first.

764
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:05,885
If he did get out, it'll be on camera.

765
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,846
Or he could've left in another car.

766
00:55:07,929 --> 00:55:10,765
But they're conducting
the search and seizure now.

767
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:12,892
Do you think they'll agree to cooperate?

768
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:14,436
We'll have to try our best.

769
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:15,812
Okay, I understand. Bye.

770
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:18,773
HWADONG MEDICAL CENTER

771
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:29,242
For crying out loud!

772
00:55:29,325 --> 00:55:31,661
An arrest warrant for what?

773
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:34,831
Baek Cheol-gyu disappeared
as soon as the search started.

774
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:36,166
What did you find?

775
00:55:36,249 --> 00:55:38,126
We couldn't review the documents yet.

776
00:55:38,209 --> 00:55:40,420
He knows he's guilty
of something, so he ran.

777
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:43,465
You can't get an arrest warrant
without evidence!

778
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:47,719
Then, let me search his home.

779
00:55:47,802 --> 00:55:49,554
For crying out loud!

780
00:55:49,637 --> 00:55:50,889
Are you kidding me?

781
00:55:50,972 --> 00:55:52,682
Gosh, you're so stubborn!

782
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:54,142
Hey!

783
00:55:56,102 --> 00:55:59,731
If you want a warrant, bring me something!
Work all night if you have to!

784
00:55:59,814 --> 00:56:01,232
That's the only way!

785
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:09,824
Wait.

786
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:14,496
By any chance,
did something happen to Mi-jin?

787
00:56:15,914 --> 00:56:17,123
Why are you asking me?

788
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:19,167
I'm worried.

789
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:21,878
If you're that worried about her,
then call her.

790
00:56:21,961 --> 00:56:23,088
Don't ask me.

791
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:25,799
She won't…

792
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,259
answer her phone.

793
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:40,105
The number you've dialed is unavailable--

794
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:45,485
CURRENT LOCATION
HWADONG MEDICAL CENTER

795
00:56:46,444 --> 00:56:47,654
Hwadong Medical Center?

796
00:56:57,956 --> 00:57:00,416
THERE'S A SENIOR INTERN
WHO LIED ABOUT THEIR IDENTITY

797
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:07,882
HWADONG MEDICAL CENTER

798
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:10,885
Good job. See you at the office.

799
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:12,220
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

800
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:15,640
Have you seen Ms. Lim?

801
00:57:15,723 --> 00:57:17,392
No, we haven't.

802
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,318
The number you've dialed is unavailable--

803
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:29,279
Where did she go?

804
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,781
Why didn't she say anything?

805
00:58:57,575 --> 00:58:59,118
DOCUMENTS

806
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:03,998
The number you've…

807
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:05,792
Where in the world is she?

808
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:19,430
This is her.

809
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:22,392
Can you check to see
if she was caught on CCTV?

810
00:59:22,475 --> 00:59:23,643
I have to find her.

811
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:25,645
-I need your help.
-Yes, I understand.

812
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:27,814
-I'll take a picture of this.
-Okay.

813
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:30,316
Here you go.

814
00:59:33,319 --> 00:59:34,988
Did you find the van?

815
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:36,197
Yes.

816
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:37,824
We were tracking it,

817
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:41,286
but it disappeared after leaving
Lee Mi-jin's place last night.

818
00:59:41,953 --> 00:59:45,081
It's unregistered,
so I think they switched the plates.

819
00:59:45,164 --> 00:59:48,001
There have been a lot of incidents lately.

820
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:51,588
So just as a precaution,
how about thinking of ways

821
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:54,299
to keep Lee Mi-jin safe?

822
00:59:55,717 --> 00:59:56,551
Well?

823
00:59:56,634 --> 00:59:57,552
Hello?

824
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:01,806
But if I'm a witness,

825
01:00:01,889 --> 01:00:04,601
why haven't the police called me yet?

826
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:06,102
-I didn't tell them.
-Why not?

827
01:00:06,185 --> 01:00:07,812
-Because of trust.
-You don't trust me?

828
01:00:07,895 --> 01:00:08,938
I can't trust the police.

829
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:12,108
What if you came to the station
as a witness, got exposed,

830
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:13,067
and became a target?

831
01:00:13,151 --> 01:00:15,403
So you should catch the culprit sooner.

832
01:00:15,486 --> 01:00:16,946
Is there anything I can testify to?

833
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:19,532
Getting involved could put you
in danger so listen to me.

834
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:20,575
Still.

835
01:00:20,658 --> 01:00:22,619
What if they come after me?

836
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:23,828
We need to catch them.

837
01:00:24,370 --> 01:00:25,663
So until then,

838
01:00:25,747 --> 01:00:26,831
you can trust me.

839
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:29,167
Lee Mi-jin!

840
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:35,757
I'll trust you, so keep your promise.

CASES OF SERIAL DISAPPEARANCES
IN SEOHAN CITY

842
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:15,505
Ms. Lee Mi-jin!

843
01:02:39,881 --> 01:02:42,800
MISS NIGHT AND DAY

844
01:02:43,134 --> 01:02:44,010
Lee Mi-jin!

845
01:02:44,969 --> 01:02:47,054
He said he didn't kidnap Lee Mi-jin.

846
01:02:47,138 --> 01:02:49,557
-No!
-Please tell me what happened.

847
01:02:50,349 --> 01:02:53,060
Please. Trust me just this once.

848
01:02:53,978 --> 01:02:56,814
Why didn't you…
Are you okay?

849
01:02:57,815 --> 01:02:58,983
Your wife's calling.

850
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:01,235
No!

851
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:04,197
We can't be sure about anything yet.

852
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,364
At first,

853
01:03:06,157 --> 01:03:08,242
I couldn't believe it either.

854
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:10,620
I'll never let someone I care about

855
01:03:11,704 --> 01:03:12,955
disappear again.
