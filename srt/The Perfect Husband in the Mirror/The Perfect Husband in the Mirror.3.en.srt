2
00:00:45,088 --> 00:00:47,264
=Episode 3=

3
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,560
Who's this?

4
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,240
Tell me!

5
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,920
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

6
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:04,920
Happy birthday,

7
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:05,720
honey.

8
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,200
You're so annoying.

9
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,320
- ♪Happy birthday to you♪
- ♪Happy birthday to you♪

10
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,120
Thank you.

11
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:22,880
Come on, honey.

12
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,560
Blow out the candle and make wishes.

13
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:25,800
Okay.

14
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,000
My first wish

15
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,280
is that everyone here today

16
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,040
can have good health and happiness.

17
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,840
My second wish is

18
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,760
that for the next seven years,

19
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,800
we'll be a happy couple

20
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,800
and all will go well.

21
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,200
My third wish...

22
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,040
Honey,

23
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,200
make the third wish

24
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,080
for yourself.

25
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,080
Don't say it out loud.

26
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,200
Okay.

27
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,520
(I hope this perfect husband)

28
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,400
(can stay perfect forever.)

29
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,640
That's it.

30
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,200
Okay.

31
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,120
Blow it out quickly.

32
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,840
Great.

33
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,200
Take this card.

34
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,000
I have saved up enough money.

35
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,040
Tomorrow,

36
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,040
we will start Weiqi's dental clinic.

37
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,080
This is my seven-year promise.

38
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,720
Look at her husband.

39
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,680
And then look at you.

40
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,880
He is her husband.

41
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,120
But we're not married.

42
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,720
So what?

43
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,480
So...

44
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,400
I don't wanna get married.

45
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,800
The thought of it is frightening.

46
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,280
Spinning around the wife all day?

47
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:52,720
I...

48
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,840
Why is she here?

49
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,440
When did you start saving?

50
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,040
The moment I fell for you.

51
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,160
It has been years.

52
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,960
How come I never knew about it?

53
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,720
I've never hidden any private money.

54
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,840
It's the dedicated fund

55
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,360
for your clinic.

56
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,040
For all these years,

57
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,560
I've saved some every month.

58
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:36,960
Haven't missed a year.

59
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,040
Honey,

60
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,920
what about breakfast?

61
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:52,800
Skip it.

62
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,320
I'm late.

63
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,200
I'm leaving now.

64
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,000
Then take it with you.

65
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,000
No.

66
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,880
I really have to go.

67
00:04:59,200 --> 00:04:59,840
Here.

68
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,720
Wait a moment.

69
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,160
Zip it up properly.

70
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,720
Be careful not to trip.

71
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,120
Weiqi!

72
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,072
(Eight years ago)

73
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,800
Be careful not to trip.

74
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,240
I'm leaving now.

75
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,600
Bye-bye.

76
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,240
Sorry, honey.

77
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,920
I shouldn't have doubted you yesterday.

78
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,400
It was my fault.

79
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,320
I turned the surprise into a scare.

80
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:43,760
Don't worry.

81
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,080
I'd rather die than cheat on you.

82
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,400
Stop that.

83
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,320
Don't talk nonsense.

84
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,400
In my heart,

85
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,840
there's only you in this lifetime.

86
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,480
I'm leaving.

87
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:00,920
Bye-bye.

88
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,440
Okay.

89
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,200
Li Ke,

90
00:06:05,856 --> 00:06:06,640
ask for leave for me.

91
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,520
Are you going to be Director Luo?

92
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,040
I'll just take a quick look
at the bank first.

93
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:11,920
No.

94
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,920
Okay. Talk later.

95
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,800
Good morning, Shi.

96
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,720
I'll bring the plan later.

97
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,640
Meng.

98
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,800
You've been eating
a lot of yams lately, haven't you?

99
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,200
You're full of energy.

100
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,880
What yam?

101
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,920
My wife is the most important.

102
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,000
Hurry up and marry one.

103
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,280
Please spare me.

104
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,840
Good morning,

105
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,080
Mr. Meng.

106
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,160
I have something to tell you.

107
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,120
If you have anything to say,

108
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,400
just tell my assistant.

109
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,480
Mr. Meng!

110
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,960
(Miss, this card number
does not exist in our bank system.)

111
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,160
(I don't know where you got it from.)

112
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,600
(Could you please confirm again?)

113
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,880
Do you have no shame?

114
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,920
We have been here before.

115
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,040
Do you remember?

116
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,320
I don't.

117
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,000
I went to your home yesterday.

118
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,440
You and your wife are truly loving.

119
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,280
I went to take back what belonged to me.

120
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,160
Also,

121
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,440
don't even think

122
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,840
about getting rid of me in this life.

123
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,440
Listen to me carefully.

124
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,040
Stay away from my wife.
