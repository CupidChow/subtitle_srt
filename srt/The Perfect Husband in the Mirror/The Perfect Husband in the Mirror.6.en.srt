2
00:00:44,832 --> 00:00:46,688
=Episode 6=

3
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,600
Weiqi.

4
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,560
Why did you space out?

5
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,760
Do you suspect
he has multiple personality disorder?

6
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,040
Do you still suspect
he's cheating on you?

7
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,040
From what I've observed
this period of time,

8
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,360
Meng Yingchao has truly changed.

9
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,000
I think he only wants to treat you well.

10
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,040
That's too much.

11
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,040
Don't you think he's
like a different person?

12
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,240
You don't have a fever.

13
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,920
Isn't that the perfect husband
you've always wanted?

14
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:29,680
Hello.

15
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,560
Hello, honey. Come back home tonight.

16
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,880
We agreed
that I'd go straight to Li Ke's home.

17
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,320
Okay.

18
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,880
Well, don't forget to do the test.

19
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:37,960
Okay.

20
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,960
Just be normal, okay?

21
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,280
Leave.

22
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,720
Do you miss me right after work?

23
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,360
Li Ke, I need you to see

24
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,840
if anyone's following me.

25
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,640
Is there?

26
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:18,760
Yes.

27
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,880
Can you see the face clearly?

28
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,840
No.

29
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,440
You send me a location
and I'll call the police.

30
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,600
You bad guy!

31
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,200
Honey, it's me.

32
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,280
Aren't you going to Li Ke's place?

33
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,440
Why are you alone?

34
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,920
You've been following me
from the clinic?

35
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,000
Why are you sneaking around?

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And you even got hurt.

37
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,760
I'll do it myself.

38
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,040
What do you mean?

39
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,840
I remember

40
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,600
you have blood phobia.

41
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,880
I have to be strong

42
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,080
to protect you.

43
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,680
I will stay at Li Ke's place tonight.

44
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,080
You'd better go home.

45
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,760
Weiqi.

46
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,040
Are you okay?

47
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,240
Why are you here?

48
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,480
Were you the one
who's been following her?

49
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,480
How do you guard your husband
like he's a thief?

50
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,040
You two are really funny.

51
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,480
You'd come home with me.

52
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,320
Li Ke, didn't we agree I'll go to

53
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,560
your place for midnight snack?

54
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,000
Can't your wife
stay at my place for one night?

55
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,520
I will stay at Li Ke's place tonight.

56
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,360
Okay then.

57
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,880
Then I'll pick you up tomorrow.

58
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:04,920
Okay.

59
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,880
Then we're leaving.

60
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,560
Let's go.

61
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,040
Welcome home, honey.

62
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,080
Mom.

63
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:37,720
Mom.

64
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,680
The man who ran away the other day

65
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,120
must be Yingchao, right?

66
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,360
You've recognized him?

67
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,440
I've recognized him at first glance.

68
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,560
Who are you?

69
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,040
What are you doing here?

70
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,520
What have you done with my son?

71
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,440
What can I do to him?

72
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,720
He made me do it.

73
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,000
Impossible.

74
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,520
I know my son

75
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,480
well.

76
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,600
You really don't know.

77
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,000
Weiqi is pregnant now.

78
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,120
Whose child?

79
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,640
Child?

80
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,600
Impossible.

81
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,480
Did you forget what the contract said?

82
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,760
You don't belong to this world.

83
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,120
It's impossible to have a child.

84
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:33,640
I...

85
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,440
Even if there is one,

86
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,240
it won't be yours.

87
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,760
Your son's child.

88
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,800
Now,

89
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,280
you really need to help your son.

90
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,720
Dr. Luo, here's your parcel.

91
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,800
Thank you.

92
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,160
Weiqi.

93
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,360
Let's go and have a meal.

94
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,160
You just go. I've ordered takeout.

95
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,360
Amy just called and said

96
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,520
she left a stocking in my car.
