00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:45,960
=Episode 13=
But one day,

3
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,160
I inadvertently found that bar.

4
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,200
I found there was another world.

5
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,440
In that world,

6
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,720
that guy has you by his side,

7
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,120
but he didn't cherish you.

8
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,200
You took me as her substitute?

9
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,280
Why would you think that?

10
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,880
I truly love you no matter where I am.

11
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,200
Meng Yingchao of this world
doesn't love you at all.

12
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,200
He dates many women besides you.

13
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,440
He has many women like Liu Yuyun.

14
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,680
He only cares about his own happiness.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,680
I'm the only one who truly loves you.

16
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,280
That's why I want to divorce him.

17
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,480
Divorce?

18
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,720
What if he doesn't let you go?

19
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,680
Then you'll have to
find a way to make him let me go.

20
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,160
Didn't you say
you love me more than him?

21
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,480
Easy to say,

22
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,960
but it's hard to do.

23
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,800
I will do whatever you ask me to.

24
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,040
We can go wherever we want afterwards.

25
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,400
We will be happy.

26
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,520
It's too early to say these things now.

27
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,040
We must find Meng Yingchao,

28
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,200
and confront him to resolve our issues.

29
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,200
Only by ending this relationship

30
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,840
can I start fresh.

31
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,120
Don't worry about this.

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Leave him to me.

33
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,200
I'll make him come back willingly soon.

34
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,560
I will also make him wish he was dead.

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,360
If you really want to take this job,

36
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,360
do as I say.

37
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,720
I'll have a fair twenty percent.

38
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,680
Hey, can't you drive?

39
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,400
That's it.

40
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,240
Just outsourcing tasks.
Same job, different hands.

41
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,480
Figure it out yourself.

42
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,400
I need to submit the plan to Mr. Sheng.

43
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,400
What?

44
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,440
I can't believe it happened.

45
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,480
I will talk to him.

46
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,440
Remember the video with Mr. Sheng?

47
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,440
Come to the company.
Something good is coming up.

48
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,040
Mr. Meng,

49
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,680
this is the women's bathroom.

50
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,440
I know.

51
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,800
Bad man.

52
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:55,960
Meng Yingchao,

53
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,640
what are you doing?

54
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,080
What do you mean?

55
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,120
This is the women's bathroom.

56
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,960
Sorry, I wasn't aware.

57
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,480
Here. Listen to this.

58
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,400
If you really want to take this job,

59
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,480
do as I say.

60
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,440
I'll have a fair twenty percent.

61
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,880
Mr. Sheng,

62
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,520
this is what we do in this industry.

63
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,080
I'm only doing my job.

64
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,040
Anything wrong?

65
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,560
You're openly taking bribes

66
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,440
and harassing female coworkers.

67
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,560
Do you admit it all?

68
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,080
Yes, I do.

69
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,240
Good.

70
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,440
Fine.

71
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,240
I don't want this to get too ugly.

72
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,480
Just quit on your own.

73
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:01,720
Hello?

74
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:02,720
Hello?

75
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,880
I want to expose them.

76
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:08,880
Just wait.

77
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,240
I'll share
your last night's secret video

78
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,240
in the gossip chat

79
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,360
and post it online.

80
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,200
Okay.

81
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,400
Mr. Sheng,

82
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,360
I've been here for so long.

83
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,960
I have made the company lots of money.

84
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,400
Now you want to rush me out?

85
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,400
That's quite disrespectful.

86
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,840
We didn't take you to court,

87
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,360
and that's doing you a big favor.

88
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,440
What about your affair with Liu Yuyun?

89
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,080
Aren't you afraid I'll talk?

90
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,320
Meng Yingchao.

91
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,080
You're having love affairs secretly.

92
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,480
You think nobody knows, huh?

93
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,200
Not to mention other places,

94
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,840
the company is
not your personal playground.

95
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,240
It isn't some romantic hotel.

96
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,880
Bathroom. Office.

97
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,080
And this sofa.

98
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,120
Your affairs are all over the place.

99
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,360
Meng Yingchao,
what on earth do you want?

100
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,720
Nothing.

101
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,680
I just want to secure my job.

102
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,200
All I need is
a word from you, Mr. Sheng.

103
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,560
And I'll shut up immediately.

104
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,080
Why are you doing this?

105
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,640
Can't you give yourself some dignity?

106
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,120
Dignity?

107
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,840
You're so hypocritical and insincere.

108
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,400
You can't even admit what you've done.

109
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,800
Things have gotten this far today,

110
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,880
and you're still talking about dignity.

111
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,680
Have you shown me any respect?

112
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,560
Have you ever respected me?

113
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,000
Meng Yingchao, you are crazy.

114
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,680
I am crazy?

115
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,960
Have I gone mad?

116
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,040
You used me and shoved me aside.

117
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,080
You think I'm the crazy one?

118
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,320
Am I crazy?

119
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,960
Someone. Get him out.

120
00:06:52,768 --> 00:06:54,688
(Li Ke)

121
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,400
Hello, Li Ke.

122
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,720
We're doomed, Weiqi.

123
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,280
What's wrong?

124
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,040
Check out the picture I sent you.

125
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,760
Nobody online believes us.

126
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,840
(This is too fake.)

127
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,200
(What kind of cheap effects are these?)

128
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,640
(Internet celebs are
recycling cliche now.)

129
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,280
(How desperate are they for fame?
It's ridiculous.)

130
00:07:14,176 --> 00:07:18,464
(What she said is true.)

131
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,080
Li Ke.

132
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,520
I found a companion.

133
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,760
You've gone mad, really mad.

134
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,800
I've gone mad, huh?

135
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:32,880
Fine.
