=The Perfect Husband in the Mirror=

2
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,232
=Episode 9=

3
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,800
Amy.

4
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,600
I just saw Shi and his imposter.

5
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,840
What did you say
when I came to beg you that day?

6
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,760
Hypocritical and ridiculous.

7
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:00,720
It's true.

8
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,080
Right here just now.

9
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,440
You really saw

10
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,960
Shi and his imposter?

11
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,360
Everyone thinks I'm crazy.

12
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,720
Amy, I can help you,

13
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,400
but you have to tell me
everything you know.

14
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,800
Why are you going to help me?

15
00:01:16,096 --> 00:01:17,108
(Husband)

16
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,240
Amy.

17
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,320
Let's meet at Bohao Cafe

18
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,720
at 9 PM today.

19
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,280
You'll see the real Shi Feiyu.

20
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,800
Okay.

21
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,720
You dare to come see me?

22
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,320
I will take you to see him.

23
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,360
Shi.

24
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,520
No.

25
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,240
You are not him.

26
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,880
Resolve it once and for all.

27
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,520
Amy,

28
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,200
it's me.

29
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,360
You heartless man.

30
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,760
I detest you.

31
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,480
Amy,

32
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,800
can you calm down?

33
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,560
How can I calm down?

34
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,080
You kept saying
you would be with me for a lifetime,

35
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,840
but you married another woman.

36
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,880
Fortunately, he was fake.

37
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,280
You would really marry me.

38
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,000
Right, Shi?

39
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,920
Marriage.

40
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,800
Is marriage the only thing
on women's minds?

41
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,240
Amy, I'm telling you.

42
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,560
I never thought about getting married.

43
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,600
I hate marriage and being tied down.

44
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,080
How many times do I have to
tell you for you to believe?

45
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,080
Can you have self-respect?

46
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,280
Shi Feiyu,

47
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,800
you bad guy.

48
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,320
Right.

49
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,600
I'm a bad guy.

50
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,640
I'm such a bad guy
that I risked complete ruin

51
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,680
to find an imposter to marry for myself,

52
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,480
just because I didn't want
to truly betray you.

53
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,080
I'm such a bad guy that time and again,

54
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,280
I can't stop making promises to you.

55
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,720
I just hope you can be happy.

56
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,160
But what about you?

57
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,440
Could you consider my feelings,

58
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:15,920
okay?

59
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,000
What you said

60
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,480
is all true?

61
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,160
My love for you is true.

62
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,640
My unwillingness to marry is true too.

63
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,120
If you can't accept it,

64
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,280
let's end it here.

65
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,680
I knew I am the one you love the most.

66
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,600
Then,

67
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,200
let's not get married.

68
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,960
As long as two people are in love,

69
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,040
a marriage certificate is not important.

70
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,200
You will keep all my secrets for me,

71
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,720
right?

72
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:09,920
(I'm sorry.)

73
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,840
(I lied.)

74
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,000
(No imposter.)

75
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,480
(I couldn't accept the reality,)

76
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,240
(so I lied to you.)

77
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,600
(Hello.)

78
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,880
(The subscriber you dialed
is power off.)

79
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,400
(Sorry.)

80
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,200
(The subscriber you have dialed...)

81
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,560
Wait a moment.

82
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,720
I will be back shortly.

83
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,120
Crisis is averted.

84
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Great tactic.

85
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,320
What are you standing here for?

86
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,440
Just like a statue.

87
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:08,800
Li Ke,

88
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,760
I'm sure

89
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,680
Meng Yingchao is fake.

90
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,000
Weiqi,

91
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,760
this can't continue.

92
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,840
You come with me now.

93
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,760
Let's go.

94
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,480
Dr. Li, did you hallucinate
or did you have insomnia this time?

95
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:34,960
Dr. Jiang,

96
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,600
this time, I am here
to see the doctor for real.

97
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,480
Don't slander me.

98
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,200
Dr. Luo.

99
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,640
You know me?

100
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,840
Dr. Li is very worried about you,

101
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,400
and she often mentions you.

102
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,120
Often?

103
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,520
You chat.

104
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,760
I'm entrusting my best friend to you.

105
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,480
Have a good chat.

106
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,520
That's about it.

107
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,840
But I know I have no evidence.

108
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,800
They will think that I'm crazy for sure.

109
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,480
So I want to ask for
your professional opinion.

110
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,040
I want to figure out if there is
something wrong with my mental state.

111
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,880
From the consultation just now,

112
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,040
I think you're fine mentally.

113
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,880
So, you think I'm okay.

114
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,320
Then

115
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,920
there's only one possibility left.

116
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,200
Someone else is

117
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,840
impersonating Meng Yingchao.

118
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,600
Would you mind

119
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,000
sharing your story?

120
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,400
When I met him,

121
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,400
we were still in college.

122
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,000
At that time, he pursued me

123
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,480
by inviting me to a concert.

124
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,560
He once remembered
all my likes and dislikes.

125
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,280
Since I love you,

126
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,280
I will support you

127
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,480
and understand you.

128
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,200
I thought he treated me best
in the world.

129
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,240
But after we got married,

130
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,960
things changed gradually.

131
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,480
He came home less often.

132
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,600
He often drank
with his friends till midnight.

133
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,960
And he often flirted with some women.

134
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,520
One day, we had a big fight.

135
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,560
Who could put up

136
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,200
with a suspicious woman like you?

137
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,040
I've wanted to divorce you for a while.

138
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,960
I made up my mind
to prepare for a divorce,

139
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,560
but the next day,

140
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,640
he suddenly became
like a different person,

141
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,520
being kind and considerate towards me.

142
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,360
I thought he had changed for the better,

143
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,720
but I discovered

144
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,440
he had forgotten much of our past.

145
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,080
We're about to have our first child.

146
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,200
Don't you remember?

147
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,440
What?

148
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,440
He followed me.

149
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,160
Why did you take a leave for me?

150
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,480
He tried to control me

151
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
like a lunatic.

152
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,360
I suspect

153
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,320
he's not my husband.

154
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,760
So I took his dental mold
for comparison.

155
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,240
They are completely different.

156
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,160
I am not the only one
who has experienced this strange thing.

157
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,240
Meng Yingchao!

158
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,480
You did it!

159
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,240
Since you took him to that place,

160
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,280
he has become a different man.

161
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,400
Got it.

162
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,560
I think you're mentally stable.

163
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,552
Based on the process of elimination,

164
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,520
your husband might be an imposter.
