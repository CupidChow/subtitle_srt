=Episode 14=

3
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,320
Turn it off!

4
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,480
Turn everything off!

5
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,040
Meng Yingchao.

6
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,520
Shut down the video now.

7
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,640
I won't hold this against you.

8
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,280
It's too late.

9
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,320
And I won't.

10
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,320
I'll kill you!

11
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,040
What's wrong with you?

12
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,480
What do you think you're doing?

13
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,080
Don't you want to go down together?

14
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,840
I want everyone to see

15
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,640
what kind of person you really are.

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,960
Everyone. Listen up.

17
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,960
Mr. Meng, Meng Yingchao,

18
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,680
he's married,

19
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,360
but he was still hitting on me at work.

20
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,960
He was afraid I would tell his wife.

21
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,640
So he beat me up
in the bathroom and threatened me.

22
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,760
There's something more.

23
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,720
He stole from the company

24
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,560
and took secret bribes.

25
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,080
No idea how much he's pocketed.

26
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,160
He's just a useless, spineless man.

27
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,480
Have you created enough drama?

28
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,640
What is wrong with you?

29
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,880
From now on,

30
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,000
I won't take your life,

31
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,880
but I'll make you
carry the guilt of a life,

32
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,800
haunting your conscience for good.

33
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,440
Call the police! It's getting serious.

34
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,680
Don't come any closer.

35
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,600
Yuyun, calm down.

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,040
Listen to me.

37
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:40,960
I'll fire him tomorrow.

38
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,640
I'll make him return
all the company's money.

39
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,400
And then I'll sue him in court.

40
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,360
Stop being hypocritical, Sheng Jianwei.

41
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,920
You promised me the position of CFO,

42
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,760
but the minute you left,
you acted like nothing happened.

43
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,080
I've figured it out.

44
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,200
Guys are the same.

45
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,280
None of you are any good.

46
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,160
Yes.

47
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,600
You're right.

48
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,200
But here we are.

49
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,600
What can you do about it now?

50
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,440
Now, put the knife down.

51
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,720
Let's talk this over nicely.

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,320
I have nothing to say
to someone like you.

53
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,640
Amy.

54
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,840
Amy, I've finally found you.

55
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,680
You left anonymous messages online.

56
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,560
Why don't you tell us the truth?

57
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,920
I'm doing very well now.

58
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,880
My husband loves me very much.

59
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,440
I don't want to

60
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,280
be part of your drama anymore.

61
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,400
Your husband?

62
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,240
- Amy.
- Shi.

63
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,280
Amy, listen to me. Snap out of it.

64
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,080
He is lying to you.

65
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,280
He is just trying to hold you back.

66
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,640
He only loves himself, Amy.

67
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,400
- Amy.
- You should go.

68
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,160
- Or I will call the police.
- Amy, snap out of it.

69
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,280
Taking bribes and
pushing a coworker to suicide?

70
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,600
Is this your solution?

71
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,760
Do you know

72
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,360
you could go to jail for that?

73
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,160
What's to be afraid of?

74
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,720
Anyway, now Liu Yuyun

75
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,400
is just lightly injured.

76
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,280
Just a light injury?

77
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,920
Aren't you trying to
have Meng Yingchao to show up?

78
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,560
All this

79
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,480
is just the beginning.

80
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,360
What on earth are you going to do?

81
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,640
It's you.

82
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,160
Dr. Jiang, you recognize me?

83
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,960
What are you doing here?

84
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,560
I'm here to ask

85
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,800
if you could get me
a certificate for mental illness.

86
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,480
I can't do that.

87
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,400
Don't turn me down so soon.

88
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,240
We do this

89
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,360
all for the good of Weiqi.

90
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,960
I think you're mistaken.

91
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,200
I have no connection with Dr. Luo.

92
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,480
Then tell me what I should do

93
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,120
to get me diagnosed with mental illness?

94
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,640
Mr. Meng,

95
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,600
only hospitals can diagnose patients.

96
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,160
By the way, Dr. Jiang,

97
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,920
he will come here to see you.

98
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,280
What should I do then?

99
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,960
Don't turn him down
and don't take responsibility.

100
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,040
I'm here to see you.

101
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,840
By the way,

102
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,760
Meng Yingchao has a mental condition.

103
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,280
He deserves it.

104
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,600
I'm fine.

105
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,920
Stop pretending to be sympathetic here.

106
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,560
Indeed, I have no sympathy for someone

107
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,920
who breaks up a family.

108
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,280
But I detest men

109
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,600
who cheat in marriage even more.

110
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,560
To be honest,

111
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,680
I am here today

112
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,240
to ask you to withdraw
the lawsuit against Meng Yingchao.

113
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,360
Why should I listen to you?

114
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,120
Because I believe

115
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,560
you hate Meng Yingchao
no less than I do.

116
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,880
Sending him to jail

117
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,600
is not enough for him.

118
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,400
Neighbors,

119
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,520
my name is Meng Yingchao.

120
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,360
Today,

121
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,000
I got fired from the company.

122
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,680
I can't believe I got fired.

123
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,560
Do you know that?

124
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,720
They believe

125
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,600
I stole their money,

126
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,880
took bribes behind my boss's back,

127
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,840
and even took my boss's woman.

128
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,960
Do you know that?

129
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,200
Now everyone in the company

130
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,760
thinks that I am a complete loser

131
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,600
and a bad man.

132
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,000
A female coworker
even tried to kill herself today.

133
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,160
And it's all my fault.

134
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,560
What do you think?

135
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,680
It's early in the morning.
Are you out of your mind?

136
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,840
Who is it?

137
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,880
Who was just speaking?

138
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:49,960
Come.

139
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,960
Let's have fun together.

140
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:51,880
Who is it?

141
00:07:59,584 --> 00:08:01,887
(Li Ke)

142
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,520
Hey, Li Ke.

143
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,240
Weiqi.

144
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,360
Did you see the video on Moments?

145
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,800
What on earth is your man up to?

146
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,480
He is acting
out of Meng Yingchao's character.

147
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,240
What do you mean?

148
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,840
Isn't this just
how Meng Yingchao behaves?

149
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,040
Got it.

150
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,280
I'll share the video in the gossip chat

151
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,040
and make sure
it goes viral to even outer space.

152
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,360
Weiqi, go take a look.
Your man has gone mad.

153
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,440
Ms. Zhang.

154
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,080
What is happening?

155
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,800
Your man has gone mad.

156
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,880
Did you tell my mother-in-law?

157
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,480
Of course, I did.

158
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,640
Hurry up, hurry up.

159
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,360
Let me grab my coat.

160
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,640
I've lost my job.

161
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,040
I'm penniless.

162
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,560
What shall I do?

163
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,480
Excuse me,

164
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,440
I'm penniless.

165
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,840
Let me have your pancake.

166
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,720
What are you doing?

167
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,840
Why are you making a fuss?

168
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,840
You'll make my son...

169
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,040
What's wrong?

170
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,280
You'll make him lose reputation.

171
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,240
What reputation?

172
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,160
He's already been shameless ages ago.

173
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:02,840
You...

174
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,480
How could you hit your mom?

175
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,080
Mind your own business!

176
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,120
I'm telling you.

177
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:08,880
You just want drama.

178
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,400
Meng Yingchao.

179
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,360
What are you doing? They're neighbors.

180
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,480
Where did you pop out from?

181
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,240
Don't look so grumpy.

182
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,040
I'm telling you.

183
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,520
I'm fed up with you.

184
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,040
I'm so sorry.

185
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,520
He's been stressed at work lately.

186
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,360
He's a bit...

187
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,560
I'm not stressed!

188
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,600
I'm telling you.

189
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,560
You've done this to me.

190
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,000
You've done this to me!

191
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,680
Go away. Don't touch me.

192
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,400
Meng Yingchao.

193
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,920
Meng Yingchao, stop it.

194
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:34,880
Let's go home.

195
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:35,640
Go.

196
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,320
- Go home.
- I'm telling you.

197
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:37,720
Go, go.

198
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,600
Sorry. We're sorry.

199
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,560
How are you doing? Are you okay?

200
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,960
Whatever you're doing will not work.

201
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,400
If Meng Yingchao really
cares about me and his mother,

202
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,760
you wouldn't exist.

203
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,880
How could it not work?

204
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,320
You'll see.

205
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,800
There's more to come.

206
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,080
What else are you going to do?

207
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,720
You want the whole world

208
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,760
to hate you to the bone?

209
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,040
To hate Meng Yingchao to the bone.

210
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,640
Sign this.

211
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,760
You're being too impulsive.

212
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,360
I don't want to get involved.
