3
00:01:31,552 --> 00:01:33,472
(Real Estate Sales Contract)

4
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,480
(The verdict is in.)

5
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,760
(I've sold the house.)

6
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,960
(I'm leaving half of the money to you.)

7
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,440
(Take care of yourself.)

8
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,800
Hello.

9
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,160
Hello.

10
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,840
The number you've dialed
is not in service.

11
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,560
Please check the number and dial again.

12
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,160
The number you've dialed
is not in service.

13
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,360
Please check the number and dial again.

14
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,520
I want to resign.

15
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:20,960
So happy?

16
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,240
Planning to seek
a better position elsewhere?

17
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,720
Bye.

18
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,800
Adults should remember
to treat themselves to candies.

19
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,920
Thank you.

20
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,080
Dr. Jiang,

21
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,280
I'll supply all the sugar
you need for the rest of your life.

22
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,320
Then you'll have to take
good care of my teeth.

23
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,160
No problem.

24
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,280
We have a more important thing
to do today. Let's hurry.

25
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,600
When you return
after completing your studies,

26
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,840
I'll work with you, Director Luo.

27
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,360
You started calling me that now.

28
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,200
Of course.

29
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,720
You promised to offer me a job.

30
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,080
No regrets allowed.

31
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,280
Not just a job.

32
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,240
I'll give you a great job.

33
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
When my business grows big,

34
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,880
I'll invite Dr. Jiang
to work together too.

35
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,560
No problem.

36
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,920
It's already hard to focus on
and excel in one thing.

37
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:54,960
I support you.

38
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,880
Amy.

39
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,240
I heard you were leaving today.

40
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,920
You look well.

41
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,800
So do you.

42
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,240
You're getting married?

43
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,760
Yes.

44
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,120
To a man I love and who loves me.

45
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,760
It's quite nice.

46
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,720
I always thought
relationships were all about effort.

47
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,360
But after I met the right person,

48
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,120
everything seemed
to fall into place naturally.

49
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,080
Alright, enough chit-chat,

50
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,920
or Dr. Luo is going to miss the flight.

51
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,440
Hurry up.

52
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,320
Okay.

53
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,440
No need to see me off. I'm leaving.

54
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,280
Weiqi.
