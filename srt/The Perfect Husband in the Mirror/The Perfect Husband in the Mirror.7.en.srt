00:00:44,896 --> 00:00:47,392
=Episode 7=

3
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,000
What's wrong? Why the rush?

4
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,000
Come on.

5
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,160
Meng Yingchao is missing.

6
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,520
Maybe he's gone to work?

7
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,440
I'm telling you,
though I didn't see clearly,

8
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,480
it must be him.

9
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,200
The current Meng Yingchao
is an impostor.

10
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,000
Mr. Meng, you're here
for Dr. Luo, right?

11
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:10,840
Yes.

12
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,360
She's not in her office.
I'll find her for you.

13
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,000
Okay.

14
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,880
Yesterday, you said he has MPD,

15
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,720
today, you said
he's a completely different person.

16
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,640
Is Meng Yingchao a twin?

17
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,240
Could there really
be two identical people?

18
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,360
You can come check it yourself.

19
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,120
Weiqi.

20
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,560
In the past, Meng was
indeed not that good.

21
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,320
But now he has truly changed.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,960
To say the least,

23
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,880
if you can't make it anymore,

24
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,200
just divorce.

25
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,320
I'll wait for her in the office.

26
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,400
I'm really worried about you.

27
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,240
You don't trust me?

28
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,160
Weiqi, honestly,

29
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,640
just come with me

30
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,280
to meet my psychologist friend.

31
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,760
Dr. Luo, your husband is here.

32
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,600
He is at the front desk.

33
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,560
Where is he?

34
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,240
He is waiting for you in the office.

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,880
You are back.

36
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,040
Come over and take a seat.

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,280
Come on.

38
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,520
Mom has come over in the morning

39
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:22,840
and stewed a fish soup.

40
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,200
I brought it to you.

41
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,520
I've ordered takeout.

42
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,960
The takeout is not good for your health.

43
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,320
Just have home-made meals.

44
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,520
Come on, have a taste.

45
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,080
I made some simple dishes.

46
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,000
Right, honey.

47
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,800
Did you do the test?

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,200
I haven't tested it yet.
It's been a busy morning.

49
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,960
Haven't you tested it yet?

50
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,960
Don't worry. I'll test it.

51
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,160
Drink more when it's warm.

52
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:18,640
Weiqi.

53
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,800
I have to go. Take a leave for me.

54
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,200
No way.

55
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,040
It's totally damaged.

56
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:25,800
It can't be fixed.

57
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,320
Can you please try again? Please.

58
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,200
This thing is kind of important to me.

59
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,320
Why didn't you take good care
of something important?

60
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,560
If it's that important,
maybe you should check

61
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,720
if there's a backup.

62
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,160
Thank you.

63
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,520
We usually keep surveillance video
for about a month.

64
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,640
I don't know if it's still there.

65
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,280
Miss Luo.

66
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,680
When did you lose your necklace?

67
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,960
Just a month ago.

68
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,320
Do you remember the exact time?

69
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,040
And

70
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,760
where did you go that day?

71
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,920
Let's check the underground parking.

72
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,920
Probably 3:30 PM.

73
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:18,640
Right here.

74
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,240
Miss Luo.

75
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,520
Don't mess it up.

76
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,400
We are responsible for it.

77
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,440
It's okay. I'm just checking.

78
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,480
Miss Luo.

79
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,960
Are you really looking for the necklace?

80
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,400
I think you should call the police.

81
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,240
Don't make it hard for us, right?

82
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,520
Honey,

83
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,200
you're back.

84
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,440
Come on and have a seat.

85
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,480
My mom and I have prepared many dishes.

86
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,680
Well...

87
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,400
What are we celebrating?

88
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,920
What else?

89
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,200
For your baby.

90
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,360
Come on, take a seat.

91
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,000
Sit down.

92
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,920
Eat more.

93
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,280
Tell me what you want to eat,

94
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,120
and I'll make it for you.

95
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,280
Whether it's Chinese or Western food,

96
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,760
I'll do it all for you.

97
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,680
If I don't know how to do it,
I'll learn.

98
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,400
How about it, honey?

99
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,400
Did you test?

100
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,120
Not yet.

101
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,080
Haven't you tested it yet?

102
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,400
I have one right here.

103
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:42,960
Go test it now!

104
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,840
Eat after you've tested it.

105
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:45,840
We'll wait for you.

106
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,560
Go, hurry.

107
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:47,920
Hurry up.

108
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:49,720
Go.

109
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:52,920
Go.
