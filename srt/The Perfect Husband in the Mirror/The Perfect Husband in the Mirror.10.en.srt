=The Perfect Husband in the Mirror=

2
00:00:44,768 --> 00:00:46,040
=Episode 10=

3
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,328
Based on the process of elimination,

4
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,200
your husband might be an imposter.

5
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,160
So, you believe me.

6
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,480
Indeed, nothing is too odd
in this large world.

7
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,320
Take this

8
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,960
and take the assessment report I offered

9
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,360
to see the psychiatrist Dr. Guo
of the public hospital.

10
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,240
Ask him to issue a certificate
of sound mental health for you.

11
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,120
I think you might need it

12
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,520
to prevent something bad.

13
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,360
Thank you.

14
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,440
Right, Dr. Jiang.

15
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,440
Be cautious.

16
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,480
Don't worry about me.

17
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,600
Honey,

18
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,040
why did you lock the door?

19
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:50,640
Honey.

20
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,440
I'm feeling a bit unwell today.

21
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,680
You sleep in the living room.

22
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,640
Oh.

23
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,400
Weiqi.

24
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,480
What's wrong?

25
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,440
Something happened to Dr. Jiang.

26
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,720
What's the matter?

27
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,600
Someone sent a complaint letter
to his boss.

28
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,800
It says that he's been having
an affair with a patient.

29
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,360
It's described in great detail.

30
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,720
If he's not fired,

31
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,120
they'll post the photos on the Internet.

32
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,560
How is this possible?

33
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,240
Just firing him on hearsay?
Is there any evidence?

34
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,800
The patient mentioned in the letter

35
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,760
is you.

36
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,760
Hello.

37
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,040
Hello, Dr. Jiang.

38
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,040
I heard about it. Are you okay?

39
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,160
I'm fine.

40
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,160
And you?

41
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,600
I...

42
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,760
Monitoring, tracking and framing.

43
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,680
He's targeting you.

44
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,840
He tried so hard
to stop your investigation.

45
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,680
I am more and more convinced
of your guess.

46
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,240
Have you watched this video?

47
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,440
She's been making frequent visits
to a psychologist recently.

48
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,840
Maybe there's really
something wrong with her mind.

49
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,440
She even made a client
bleed from the mouth.

50
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,080
Don't talk nonsense.

51
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,560
Don't you have patients to treat?

52
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,840
Weiqi,

53
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,200
is someone messing with you?

54
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,800
Dr. Luo, do you have time

55
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,480
for a chat?

56
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,720
Recently, we have received six
or seven calls of complaint about you

57
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,680
and a letter reporting you

58
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,640
for a mental illness.

59
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,000
Ms. Wang,

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,680
you believe their nonsense?

61
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,800
That just means someone
is trying to cause trouble.

62
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,960
I am wronged.

63
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,400
Why do you want to fire me?

64
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,200
But you have caused a bad impact
on the reputation of our clinic.

65
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,560
It is clearly written in the contract

66
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,840
that we don't employ people
with a bad reputation.

67
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,440
The contract also states

68
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,480
the salary and the social security
are fully paid.

69
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,040
Why didn't you mention that?

70
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,120
I will investigate this matter.

71
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,080
It's not up to you anymore.

72
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,680
Whether you want compensation or not,

73
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,880
you should pack
your things and leave today.

74
00:04:57,696 --> 00:04:59,178
(Yameijia Employee Termination Notice)

75
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,840
I don't need compensation.

76
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,120
Once I figure this out,

77
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,880
I need an official apology
from the clinic.

78
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,480
Weiqi,

79
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,880
I will definitely help you
find out who did it.

80
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,280
No need.

81
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,720
I know who it is.

82
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,120
Honey,

83
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,840
you're back.

84
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,200
Sit.

85
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,280
What's wrong?

86
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,480
I've lost my job.

87
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,680
You've lost your job?

88
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,640
It's a good thing.

89
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,080
It's a good thing?

90
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,400
Yeah.

91
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,000
We can

92
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,200
go to a faraway place.

93
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,560
Don't you want to open
a clinic by yourself?

94
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:00,960
I'll provide the money.

95
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,280
Meng Yingchao,

96
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,440
let's get a divorce.

97
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,200
What's this about?

98
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,840
Why do you suddenly
want to get a divorce?

99
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,440
No.

100
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,000
Honey,

101
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,680
it was not what you think.

102
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,000
You misunderstood it.

103
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,360
Weiqi.

104
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,440
We're doing fine
and now you want a divorce?

105
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,040
What are you doing?

106
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,160
She's still carrying a baby.

107
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:49,840
Mom,

108
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,560
Weiqi is going to get a divorce with me.

109
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:53,880
Divorce?

110
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,120
Then...

111
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,520
Then it must be his fault.

112
00:06:59,240 --> 00:06:59,880
Weiqi,

113
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,200
don't mind him.

114
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:01,720
Mom.

115
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,440
What I say goes.

116
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,680
Go away.

117
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,400
Get out.

118
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,040
Get out.

119
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,480
Wait.

120
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,200
- Go.
- Wait, Mom.

121
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,440
What if she divorces me and leaves?

122
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,800
I won't leave.

123
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,240
I'll be here waiting for you.

124
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,000
I'll be waiting for you to divorce me.

125
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,640
- I...
- Go.

126
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,320
Go.

127
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,160
- Leave here.
- Mom.

128
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:17,800
Leave.

129
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,880
Get out.

130
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,320
Get out now.

131
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,400
Yingchao has gone too far recently,

132
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,080
but he still cares about you.

133
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:27,840
Mom,

134
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,000
don't you think

135
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,160
he hasn't been acting
like himself recently?

136
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,600
Nonsense.

137
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,800
What do you mean by that?

138
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,720
It's exaggerated.

139
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,360
He stalked and secretly filmed.

140
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,920
He even wanted to take me away.

141
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,360
Isn't that exaggerated?

142
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,160
I don't know

143
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,600
whether we will get a divorce,

144
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,960
but if he continues like that,

145
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,920
our baby will be gone.

146
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,560
What?

147
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,520
Don't joke about the child.

148
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,240
It may bring bad luck.

149
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,120
Tell me

150
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,160
what he's done wrong.

151
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,760
I will scold him.

152
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:07,880
Mom,

153
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,160
I plan to sell the house
to divide our property

154
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,280
before the divorce.

155
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,000
What?

156
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,200
Selling the house? Divorce?

157
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,560
You want the child
to be homeless since birth?

158
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,960
Anyway, I don't want
to go on with him, Mom.

159
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:26,960
Don't worry.

160
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,360
I'm here.

161
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,400
Tomorrow morning,

162
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,720
everything will be back to normal.

163
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:35,920
Okay.

164
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,680
Then

165
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,480
I will

166
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,360
wait for your news.

167
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,200
Hello, Li Ke.

168
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,400
How's it going?

169
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,800
My mother-in-law knows something.

170
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,880
I told you.

171
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,480
How could she not know?

172
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,320
Let's proceed according to the plan.

173
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,120
Okay.

174
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,800
Stick to the plan.
