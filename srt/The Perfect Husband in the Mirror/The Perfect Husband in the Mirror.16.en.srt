=Episode 16=

3
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,840
How could this happen?

4
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,160
Hello, Li Ke.

5
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,280
Hello.

6
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,200
Someone is knocking on our door.

7
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,160
Are you okay?

8
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,200
Sneaking around.

9
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,120
Hello?

10
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,440
Weiqi,

11
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,320
are you okay?

12
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,280
Not convenient to talk?

13
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,240
Honey.

14
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,080
It's me.

15
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,600
I'm back.

16
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,520
It's okay now, just Meng Yingchao.

17
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,160
Take off your shoes.

18
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,240
Where did you go?

19
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:43,960
I had

20
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,680
a drink with Shi.

21
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,080
Shi?

22
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,680
He didn't accompany his wife,
but drank with you?

23
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,752
He had just started drinking,

24
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,480
and then his wife called him away.

25
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,600
So,

26
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,240
I rushed back as well

27
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,520
to be with my wife.

28
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,440
Today...

29
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,480
Is the floor mopped?

30
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,400
Are the dishes washed?

31
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,280
Is the laundry done?

32
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,200
What?

33
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,960
You said you'd take care
of all the housework.

34
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,600
The washing machine's down for days.

35
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,920
It's piled up like a mountain.
You should get to work now.

36
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,000
Okay.

37
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,800
Well, I'm going to sleep.

38
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,480
You brought this on yourself.

39
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You can't blame me.

40
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,320
Honey.

41
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,640
Why did you lock the door, honey?

42
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,840
Honey.

43
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,200
I don't have a job now.

44
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,640
No need to go to work.

45
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,520
Why up so early?

46
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,360
Back to sleep.

47
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:43,920
Honey.

48
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,640
I'm not in the mood.

49
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,960
Not in the mood?

50
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,080
Not in the mood for you.

51
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,520
Then,

52
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,280
I'll make breakfast for you.

53
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:06,680
Coming.

54
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,480
Mom.

55
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:14,640
Mom.

56
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,760
What's wrong?

57
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:18,920
What's wrong?

58
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,720
All thanks to you.

59
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,800
Why is my life so miserable?

60
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,360
My husband is a bad guy.

61
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,600
I've raised my son through hardship,

62
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,960
but he ended up like this.

63
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:34,920
Mom.

64
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,360
Don't call me mom. It's disgusting.

65
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,760
I'm here to cook for
my daughter-in-law and the child.

66
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,360
What do you take yourself for?

67
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,200
Mom, I'm Yingchao.

68
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,480
You are Yingchao?

69
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,280
- You still dare to pretend.
- Mom.

70
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,040
- Mom, I really am Yingchao.
- You've ruined my son.

71
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,000
Do you know that?

72
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,200
- I will beat you to death.
- Mom.

73
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,320
You've destroyed my son.

74
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:02,680
Mom.

75
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,400
When my dad was on his deathbed,

76
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,200
you told me to pull the plug,
but I didn't dare.

77
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,640
I'm really Yingchao.

78
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,880
Son.

79
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,200
You're really Yingchao.

80
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,320
My son,

81
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,960
son.

82
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,560
Son.

83
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,840
You're back.

84
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:40,640
Honey.

85
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,480
Come and sit. Dinner time.

86
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,680
Honey.

87
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,240
Where are you going today?

88
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,280
I'm going to work.

89
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,280
Are you putting on
such heavy makeup for work?

90
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,480
Don't I always do this every day?

91
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,600
You...

92
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,360
You're pregnant
and still wearing such heavy makeup?

93
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,360
Having such greasy food
early in the morning?

94
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,680
Then I will redo it.

95
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,880
No need, Mom.

96
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:19,920
Hello.

97
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:21,800
Dr. Jiang.

98
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,000
Okay, Dr. Jiang.

99
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,920
Then we'll meet later.

100
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:26,760
Alright.

101
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,000
Bye.

102
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,640
I have something urgent. Gotta go.

103
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,600
You take your time eating.

104
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,440
Honey, have something before you go.

105
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,840
Honey.

106
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,520
Even if we have let her down,

107
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,440
there's no need to be so disrespectful.

108
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,200
She's already been fired.

109
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,400
Still applying lipstick
and drawing eyebrows every day.

110
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,600
She's going to see that Dr. Jiang,

111
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,320
being alone together.

112
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,600
Not shying away at all.

113
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,320
Weiqi got fired?

114
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,160
You didn't know?

115
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,080
She got photographed with this guy,

116
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,360
being lovey-dovey.

117
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,640
Don't get agitated.

118
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,800
(Yameijia Clinic Dental)
Meng Yingchao, why are you here?

119
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,240
Where is my wife?

120
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,440
Where is my wife?

121
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,200
She has a patient now.

122
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,800
She has quit her job.
What patient does she have?

123
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,920
Patients have privacy.
You can't just look around.

124
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,040
He's here.

125
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:33,720
I know.

126
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:36,760
Security.

127
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:37,760
Security, quick!

128
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,040
What are you doing?

129
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,800
What are you doing?

130
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,280
What is this?

131
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:42,840
Let go.

132
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,360
Let go.

133
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,200
- Ties comfy?
- Let go.

134
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,040
You let go.

135
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:45,760
What are you doing?

136
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,240
What is this?

137
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:46,920
You let go.

138
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,160
- Let go.
- What are you doing?

139
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:48,600
Let go.

140
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,440
- Let go.
- What is this?

141
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,800
Let go.

142
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,200
What are you doing?

143
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,560
What kind of hospital is this?

144
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,880
What kind of clinic is this?

145
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,160
Doctors are having an affair
under broad daylight here?

146
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,520
What kind of nonsense hospital is this?

147
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,560
You are so shameless.

148
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,040
Help!

149
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:24,720
Dead body!
