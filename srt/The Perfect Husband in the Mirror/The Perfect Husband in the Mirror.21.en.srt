=Episode 21=

3
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,400
Meng Yingchao,

4
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,160
I really didn't expect this.

5
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,280
If I make this video public,

6
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,360
you can still stay in the company?

7
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,400
You died before me.

8
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,480
Looks like fate is fair.

9
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,360
What did you say?

10
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,440
Bah! You shameless thing.

11
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,960
No one came to visit you after you died.

12
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,600
You hurt a woman.

13
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,840
You're not a man.

14
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,360
Today,

15
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,440
let me say goodbye to you.

16
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,720
Thanks to you,

17
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,600
I've become a mad woman
cursed by everyone.

18
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,120
A toast to you.

19
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,040
Son.

20
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,400
This is...

21
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,800
Flour?

22
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,120
A funeral?

23
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,560
You want to fake his death?

24
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,840
You give me fake ashes.

25
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,640
I'll hold a funeral for him.

26
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,880
You want everyone to think he's dead.

27
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,200
When the funeral is over,

28
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,880
you will let him out, right?

29
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,760
During this period,

30
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,080
don't let anything happen
to Meng Yingchao.

31
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,280
You won't abandon me

32
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,280
when it's over, will you?

33
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,960
If you don't believe me,

34
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,440
you can just keep lying here.

35
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,160
Of course I believe you.

36
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,000
But remember,
before the funeral is over,

37
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,880
Meng Yingchao will not show up.

38
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,440
After the funeral,

39
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,760
we'll leave together.

40
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,320
Weiqi,

41
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,000
I heard there was a fire
in the psychiatric hospital.

42
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,280
Meng Qi set the fire.

43
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,200
He took Meng Yingchao,

44
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,360
and forced me to leave with him.

45
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,720
Why don't we confront him head-on?

46
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,040
We can't.

47
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,840
Meng Qi is insane.

48
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,920
It will be a lose-lose situation.

49
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,000
What should we do now?

50
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,600
The top priority now
is to find Meng Yingchao.

51
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,000
Leave this to me.

52
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:22,520
Let's go.

53
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,360
Where?

54
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,920
Prepare for a funeral.

55
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,320
Okay.

56
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,480
What are you doing?

57
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:51,960
Mom,

58
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,520
I am Yingchao.

59
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,040
Nonsense. I am Meng Yingchao.

60
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,640
What's going on?

61
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,920
Don't you know that?

62
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,440
This is my world.

63
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,560
If you kill me,

64
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,560
you'll kill yourself too.

65
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,320
As long as you can't harm me,

66
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,400
I won't give Luo Weiqi to you.

67
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,680
Son, you...

68
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,640
You are still alive.

69
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,280
You scared me to death.

70
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,960
Guys, look.

71
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,880
The real and the fake husbands
show up together.

72
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,880
Which of you is the real one?

73
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,400
Of course it's me.

74
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,800
Of course it's me.

75
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,720
I am Yingchao, Mom.

76
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,960
This is really strange.

77
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,960
A mother
can't even recognize her own son.

78
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,040
Shut up.

79
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,080
If there is no other way,
I'll accept both.

80
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:42,760
No way.

81
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,600
You can have two sons.

82
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,000
But I can't have two husbands.

83
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,400
Weiqi,

84
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,160
I am the real Yingchao.

85
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,520
You should know.

86
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,640
Shut up.

87
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,840
Weiqi,

88
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,120
we've been together for so long.

89
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,920
You must be able to recognize me, right?

90
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,960
Although I don't want to admit

91
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,880
one of you is my husband,

92
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,080
this farce needs to end.

93
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,040
Meng Yingchao,

94
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,360
it's time to take your responsibility.

95
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,200
You unfilial son.

96
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,720
Look at what you've done.

97
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,320
- Look at what you've done.
- Mom.

98
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,720
You scared me to death.

99
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,320
Mom.

100
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,800
Son.

101
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,080
You scared me to death.

102
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,800
Son.

103
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,320
What are you doing?

104
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,520
We had a deal.

105
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,720
Come with me.

106
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,040
What are you doing?

107
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,320
What are you doing?

108
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,840
What are you doing?

109
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,440
Weiqi.

110
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,280
What are you doing?

111
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,400
Get out of the way.

112
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,160
Stop fighting.

113
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,400
Don't touch my son.

114
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,600
What are you doing? Weiqi, come here.

115
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,240
Come here.

116
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:23,960
Get out of my way.

117
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,360
Come here. Come here.

118
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:27,840
Get out of my way.

119
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:32,840
Meng Yingchao.
