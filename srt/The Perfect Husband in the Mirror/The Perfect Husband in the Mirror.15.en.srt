What else are you going to do?

3
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,600
You want the whole world

4
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,560
to hate you to the bone?

5
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,640
To hate Meng Yingchao to the bone.

6
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,160
Sign this.

7
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,440
You're being too impulsive.

8
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,920
I don't want to get involved.

9
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:26,640
Alright,

10
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:27,680
that's fine.

11
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,920
Anyway, in this way,

12
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,920
I have even fewer worries.

13
00:01:48,269 --> 00:01:50,200
(Crazy Meng Yingchao,
get out of the neighborhood!)

14
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,760
What are you doing?

15
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,680
My son is not that kind of person.

16
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,560
You've misunderstood.

17
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,080
You've misunderstood.

18
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,520
Hey.

19
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,320
It's crooked.

20
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,520
To the right a bit.

21
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,560
Pull it to the right a bit more.

22
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,560
You go inside.

23
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,520
Aren't you embarrassed?

24
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,000
Shouldn't your son see a psychiatrist?

25
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:18,760
I...

26
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,840
Splattered me with eggs.

27
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,880
Don't worry about this.

28
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,720
Leave him to me.

29
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,720
I'll make him come back willingly soon.

(Kanglan City First People's Hospital's

31
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,720
Hello.

32
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,880
Meng Yingchao will return very soon.

33
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,320
When?

34
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:16,840
Not now.

35
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,600
You still need to go somewhere

36
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,880
to do something.

37
00:03:25,088 --> 00:03:26,400
(New Club)

38
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,760
Is it him?

39
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,080
It's him. He's mentally ill.

40
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,720
What are you talking about?

41
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,320
We didn't say anything.

42
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,480
It's going viral online.

43
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,120
Look, see for yourself.

44
00:03:59,111 --> 00:04:04,992
(Crazy Meng Yingchao,
get out of the neighborhood!)

45
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,520
Meng Qi.

46
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,040
Get out of here!

47
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,640
Honey.

48
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,200
Who are you so angry with?

49
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,600
Darling?

50
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,760
I don't know what's going on here.

51
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,760
A bunch of elderly women
in the neighborhood,

52
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,680
upon seeing me,

53
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,560
started throwing dirty things at me,

54
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,200
and they looked at me in a strange way.

55
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,000
Yeah.

56
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,560
You've changed lately.

57
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,920
Like you've become a different person.

58
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,040
You've lost your job,
and your reputation is ruined.

59
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,760
And you owe a lot of debt.

60
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,760
Tens of millions.

61
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,840
How can our little family bear this?

62
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,240
Let's sell this apartment,

63
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,400
and go somewhere else.

64
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,840
Okay? Let's go.

65
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:13,960
Honey.

66
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,760
About this,

67
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,560
let's take our time to discuss it.

68
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,320
I'll sort things out first.

69
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,480
You go rest in the room.

70
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,480
I'll clean up these dirty things.

71
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,200
Have a good rest.

72
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,360
Meng Yingchao will return very soon.

73
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,880
When?

74
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,600
Not now.

75
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,040
You still need to go somewhere

76
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,680
to do something.

77
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,440
He has already seen the photo.

78
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,120
Meng Yingchao,
what are you trying to do?

79
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,240
What are you trying to do?

80
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,600
Are you trying to ruin me?

81
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,440
You put me deeply in debt.

82
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,760
You made me lose my job,

83
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,680
and diagnosed with insanity.

84
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,320
Everyone condemns me.

85
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,120
What did you say?

86
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,240
What are you doing?

87
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,720
Hey, over here.

88
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,240
Help! Somebody!

89
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,760
Weiqi already knows everything.

90
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,080
Only I can explain to everyone.

91
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,200
No need for your explanation.

92
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,480
What are you doing?

93
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,040
Meng Yingchao,

94
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,400
you better think clearly.

95
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,680
If I really disappear,

96
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,120
whether it's going to jail

97
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,960
or the rumors in the company,

98
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,800
you'll have to handle it alone.

99
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,280
Shut up!

100
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,880
Let me tell you.

101
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,080
You are fake,

102
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,720
and I am the real one.

103
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,600
You can never replace me.

104
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,640
You are not worthy
to be Luo Weiqi's husband at all.

105
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,560
What qualifications do you have?

106
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,080
Disappear from this world.

107
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,120
How could this happen?
