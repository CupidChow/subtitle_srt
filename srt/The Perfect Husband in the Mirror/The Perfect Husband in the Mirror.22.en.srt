=The Perfect Husband in the Mirror=

2
00:00:45,184 --> 00:00:47,552
=Episode 22=

3
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,800
I'm not leaving.

4
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,200
You wanted to exchange your life.

5
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,600
But look at what you've done.

6
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,000
It's all your fault.

7
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,320
I cherish her and love her

8
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,400
more than you do.

9
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,280
Shut up.

10
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,520
You cheated on her.

11
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,120
You don't deserve to be her husband.

12
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:02,880
I'm not going back.

13
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,760
What are you doing?

14
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,080
Luo Weiqi,

15
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,600
didn't you say

16
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,040
we'll leave together?

17
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,200
Have you forgotten?

18
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,440
Have you forgotten all of it?

19
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,920
I need to be sure

20
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,320
if you would leave with me.

21
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,960
Of course I would.

22
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,240
You are much better than Meng Yingchao.

23
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,200
But if we leave,

24
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,920
my mother-in-law
will surely come looking for us.

25
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,800
I don't want to spend our future days
in fear or anxiety.

26
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,400
Trust me.

27
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,400
I will treat you well.

28
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,320
Haven't you realized it yet?

29
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,120
Stop daydreaming.

30
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,120
Meng Yingchao,

31
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:50,880
do you think

32
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,680
you can live in peace

33
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,240
after I leave?

34
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,120
You ungrateful bad guy.

35
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,520
It's none of your business.

36
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,000
Everyone,

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,200
you either are exchanging your lives

38
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,240
or have already exchanged your lives.

39
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,160
Do you really think

40
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,320
you can shirk all responsibilities
in this way?

41
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,760
The New Club is filthy.

42
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,360
What's behind it
is selfishness and cowardice.

43
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,120
Giving your lives to strangers.

44
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,640
You are truly pitiable,
detestable, and pathetic.

45
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,720
Ask yourselves.

46
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,440
How can you face yourselves

47
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,920
and those who love you?

48
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,600
Are you okay?

49
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,160
Yes.

50
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,000
How did it go?

51
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,440
The only way
to restore order in this world

52
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,000
is to shatter that mirror.

53
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,800
Meng Qi.

54
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,400
Let me go.

55
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,600
My name is...

56
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,560
I know.

57
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,440
You have been following me.

58
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,480
No.

59
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,200
I...

60
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,760
Actually, I've liked you...

61
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,760
I've liked you for a long time.

62
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,760
(We had a deal.)

63
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,040
(Come with me.)

64
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,760
(After the funeral,)

65
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,080
(we'll leave together.)

66
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,080
(Of course I would.)

67
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,760
(I'll make him
come back willingly soon.)

68
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,320
(I will also make him wish he was dead.)

69
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,360
(If I sign this,)

70
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,040
(you will leave with me, right?)

71
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:36,880
(I will)

72
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,280
(take care of Weiqi for you.)

73
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,800
(We're about to have our first child.)

74
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,720
(That's great.)

75
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,360
(Honey.)

76
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,040
(I miss you so much.)

77
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,840
(You have no idea)

78
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,000
(how long I've been waiting
for this day.)

79
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,360
(Well,)

80
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,840
(can't I be nice to my wife?)

81
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:58,640
(Weiqi,)

82
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,600
(let's start over.)

83
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,600
Honey.

84
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,440
Sorry.

85
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,280
If you want to pursue me,

86
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,880
I can only say sorry.

87
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,960
That one is fake.

88
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,280
And now the real one is back.

89
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,080
Hello, a cup of cappuccino, please.

90
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,800
Madam, I think the mirror is gone.

91
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:02,800
Retreat.

92
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,120
What?

93
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,200
I said, "Retreat".

94
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:18,880
Weiqi.

95
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,720
You saw what happened just now.

96
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,520
This is not AI technology.

97
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,000
They are not twins, either.

98
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,320
To shirk his responsibility
for the family,

99
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,880
my husband
found a substitute to live with me.

100
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,560
These fake husbands
come from a mirror of the New Club.

101
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,360
For her own interests,

102
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,160
the owner of the club
would help those who are cowardly

103
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,680
and afraid of facing the reality,
just like my husband.

104
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,160
That's right.

105
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,200
I am also one of the victims.

106
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,160
My ex, Shi, just wants a girlfriend.
He doesn't want to take responsibility.

107
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,880
So he went to the New Club

108
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,680
and found someone identical to him
to marry a rich woman.

109
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,240
And he used her money
to live a life of debauchery.

110
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,720
This club will disappear soon.

111
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,280
However,

112
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,600
it might reappear somewhere.

113
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,680
So I hope,

114
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,440
if one day you find out
the person beside you is fake,

115
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,880
do not be deceived by tenderness.

116
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,760
Please step forward.

117
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,520
Do not become a victim.

118
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,760
Let's go.

119
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,160
They ran away fast enough.

120
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,160
Maybe

121
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,640
they'll still show up somewhere.

122
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,280
I hope they'll never show up
to harm anyone again.
