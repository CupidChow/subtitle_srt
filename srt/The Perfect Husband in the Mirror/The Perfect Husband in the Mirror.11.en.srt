2
00:00:44,928 --> 00:00:47,392
=Episode 11=

3
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:03,960
Where's the person?

4
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,040
Up ahead.

5
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,320
I can't get too close.

6
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,480
Cheers.

7
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,320
You don't know.

8
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,360
I just came back from a road trip
with some buddies.

9
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,400
During that time,

10
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,120
there were no work calls

11
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,680
and no family burden.

12
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,040
Also,

13
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,880
someone was doing my job

14
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,520
to make money for me.

15
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,760
I could do
whatever I want to. So free.

16
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,880
Actually, I think marriage

17
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,280
is just a besieged city.

18
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,960
Sometimes, you need to go out to relax.

19
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,760
That was the first time

20
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,280
I'd felt such freedom and joy.

21
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,880
What if I want to return?

22
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,280
It's easy.

23
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,560
You pay for it.

24
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,160
Continue if you want to.

25
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,080
Terminate the contract

26
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,960
if you don't want to.

27
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,640
Come back if you want to come back.

28
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,200
You still know to come back?

29
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,080
Mom,

30
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,360
why are you here?

31
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,640
Let me go in and have a look.

32
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,600
Wait for me.

33
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,800
I tell you

34
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,880
I know it clearly.

35
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,640
Since you took him to that place,

36
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,000
he has become a different man.

37
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,920
I'm sorry, lady.

38
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,520
You can't use a mobile phone here.

39
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,720
Why?

40
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,600
That's the rule.

41
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,280
Otherwise, please leave.

42
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,680
My wife is pregnant.

43
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,920
Take care of her for me.

44
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,600
We've tried so many methods here
but still can't get a baby.

45
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,440
You really don't know
how blessed you are.

46
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,800
Isn't this just right? Deal.

47
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,240
You bad guy.

48
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,960
The imposter told me everything.

49
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,320
What?

50
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,200
Do you know your wife is pregnant?

51
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,040
She is pregnant?

52
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,840
Really?

53
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,600
It can't be true.

54
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,440
I saw the report with my own eyes.

55
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,760
How can it be fake?

56
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,320
You let a stranger stay in your home.

57
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,280
Aren't you afraid that he'll harm
your child and your wife?

58
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,200
Mom,

59
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,560
you don't know this.

60
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,240
I am him, and he is me.

61
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,280
In his world,

62
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,360
he didn't win over Luo Weiqi,

63
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,680
so in this world,

64
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,400
he can't be happier.

65
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:11,800
Mom,

66
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,800
just let me

67
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,040
have a good rest away from my home.

68
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,000
My home

69
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,040
is practically suffocating.

70
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,920
You're suffocating.

71
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,200
Your wife is about to divorce you.

72
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,800
Let's go.

73
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,160
Mom,

74
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,040
I don't mind

75
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,160
divorcing her.

76
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,200
Go home.

77
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,440
Calm down.

78
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,480
Or else

79
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,640
I'll return in a few days.

80
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:46,960
Okay, Mom?

81
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,760
In a few days?

82
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,400
What if that imposter

83
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,800
divorces her for you?

84
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,800
He.

85
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,480
Mom,

86
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,200
I told you. It won't happen.

87
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,520
For him now,

88
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,360
this is the life he dreamed of.

89
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,320
How about this?

90
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,680
You just let him stay there.

91
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,040
You still let him stay at home?

92
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,880
Then you can't come back in the future.

93
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:10,960
Mom,

94
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,920
actually, during this period of time,

95
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,000
I've been back a few times.

96
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,880
I thought his performance
was quite good.

97
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,200
If he wants this marriage,

98
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,600
I'll give it to him.

99
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,160
Let's go. No more drinking.

100
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,360
- Let's go home.
- Mom.

101
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,720
- Right now.
- Mom, stop it.

102
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,640
- What's wrong with you?
- Mom, sit for a while.

103
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,880
Why are you so disobedient?

104
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:28,840
Mom.

105
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,760
- Let's go.
- Mom.

106
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,520
Let's go.
