1
00:00:08,128 --> 00:00:10,338
(There is a legend
passed down in Kanglan)

2
00:00:13,088 --> 00:00:15,040
(that there is a place called New Club.)

3
00:00:18,016 --> 00:00:19,402
(It is rumored that this club)

4
00:00:19,552 --> 00:00:21,257
(can manufacture a doppelganger of you,)

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,398
(living the life
you don't want to live for you.)

6
00:00:25,093 --> 00:00:26,080
(After signing the contract,)

7
00:00:26,187 --> 00:00:27,844
(the person in the mirror
will live for you.)

8
00:00:28,331 --> 00:00:30,144
(For all the consequences
caused by this,)

9
00:00:30,144 --> 00:00:32,178
(the club
does not take any responsibility.)

10
00:00:32,443 --> 00:00:33,312
Isn't it perfect?

11
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:34,584
The contract is established.

12
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,948
=The Perfect Husband in the Mirror=

13
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,320
=Episode 1=
(My name is Luo Weiqi.)

14
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,000
(He is Meng Yingchao.)

15
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,880
(- This is my mother-in-law, Li Huixian.
- Honey,)

16
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,560
(come on.)

17
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,600
(- Maybe we've been married for too long.
- Gentle.)

18
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,880
(So we have lost our passion)

19
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,400
(and have to pretend to be close.)

20
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,760
(Stop. That's itchy.)

21
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,120
(What's the rush?)

22
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,600
(You're on my hair.)

23
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,400
(Wait, wait.)

24
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,560
(It's our seventh anniversary)

25
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,440
(in a few days.)

26
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,600
It's been seven years already.

27
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,000
Even cats and dogs
could have lots of kittens or puppies.

28
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,720
But you haven't even given me
a grandchild.

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,880
That's intolerable.

30
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,120
Meng Yingchao?

31
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,480
I have a meeting
and need to leave early.

32
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,800
Meng Yingchao?

33
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:10,680
I'm not eating either.

34
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,040
You... Sit down.

35
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:12,480
Here.

36
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,440
Drink this soup.

37
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,040
It's pig placenta soup.

38
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,440
I've finished this for you,

39
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,720
Weiqi.

40
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,200
It's been so long.

41
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,120
Why aren't you pregnant yet?

42
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,720
My husband and I...

43
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,920
Honey.

44
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,240
How about we...

45
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,440
I'm not in the state.

46
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,760
Are you not in a state
or not in a state towards me?

47
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:48,840
Weiqi,

48
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,480
listen to me.

49
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,240
No man

50
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,720
can do without it for a year.

51
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,200
Be careful that he has some other woman.

52
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,560
Did you hear me?

53
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,160
Weiqi, you should go home quickly.

54
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,200
I saw your husband
take a woman into your house.

55
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,840
Where is that woman?

56
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,760
What are you looking for?

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,360
What about the high heel mark
at the door and this strand of hair?

58
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,760
They belong to Amy,
Shi's new girlfriend.

59
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,400
So this is why?

60
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,800
Just stop making a fuss.

61
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,400
I'm already very tired.

62
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,080
Give me a break.

63
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,960
So you think I'm not tired?

64
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,040
You haven't even touched me for a year.

65
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,280
We have to trick your mom every day.

66
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,240
You want a child, huh?

67
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,240
But I'm not an amoeba
that can undergo binary fission.

68
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,400
No man can tolerate a woman

69
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,360
as suspicious as you.

70
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,520
Do you want a divorce?

71
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,680
Meng Yingchao, you rat!

72
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,120
Do you think only you can smash?

73
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,120
Do you think so?

74
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,040
What are you doing?

75
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,800
Luo Weiqi,

76
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,240
I've wanted to divorce you
for a long time.

77
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,280
Fine.

78
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,640
Let's get a divorce tomorrow.

79
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,680
I've decided.

80
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,480
I can't live

81
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,680
this life anymore.

82
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,400
(I thought our marriage
had come to an end.)

83
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,760
(But surprisingly,)

84
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,400
(after that night,)

85
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,920
(everything has changed.)

86
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:45,880
Honey.

87
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,720
Soon, I won't be.

88
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,600
What?

89
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:06,920
Move away.

90
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,320
What?

91
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,280
What are you doing?

92
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,960
What's this, Meng Yingchao?

93
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,600
(Somehow, he seems)

94
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,680
(to have become a different man.)

95
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,920
Your complexion

96
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,160
is rosy and fair.

97
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,320
It's like you are glowing.

98
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,720
What happened?

99
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,520
The parched land met sweet rain?

100
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,040
Dr. Luo!

101
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,280
Someone sent you flowers.

102
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,240
There's also a card.

103
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,640
Thank you.

104
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,320
I don't know what happened.

105
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,320
He's been a different person
since the morning.

106
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:30,920
Who is it?

107
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,120
Hello?

108
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,360
Hello, honey.

109
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,440
I'm outside your clinic.

110
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,240
Ask for leave.

111
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,480
I wasn't planning to take leave.

112
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,680
Then I'll come in.

113
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,160
No need. I'll go out.

114
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,840
I'll take you to a place.

115
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,320
Did you prepare all this by yourself?

116
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:01,640
Yeah.

117
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:03,960
It's our date.

118
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,520
Shouldn't it be like this?

119
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,920
We haven't had a date like this
for so long,

120
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,560
right?

121
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:11,640
Weiqi,

122
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,280
I really love you.

123
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:16,760
Really?

124
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,320
Why can't I feel it?

125
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,680
I'll prove it to you.

126
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,040
Then I will

127
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,520
wait and see.

128
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,440
(In this moment,)

129
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,680
(it's as if we've gone back
to when we were dating.)

130
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,160
(This long-lost sweetness
has me in a daze.)

131
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,400
(Is this really him?)

132
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,360
Don't worry.

133
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,280
I won't let her find out.

134
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,560
I've handled everything.
