=The Perfect Husband in the Mirror=

2
00:00:44,704 --> 00:00:47,200
=Episode 4=

3
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,240
Listen to me carefully.

4
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,200
Stay away from my wife.

5
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,760
What if I don't?

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,760
The person you love isn't me at all.

7
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,840
And the person I love isn't you.

8
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,720
Don't you understand?

9
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,440
Why is the door locked?

10
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,640
Who's in there?

11
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,760
Mr. Meng, the meeting is about to start.

12
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,120
So, we are highly competitive

13
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,560
in this case now.

14
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,080
Who's in charge of this case now?

15
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,160
It should be Liu Yuyun.

16
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,720
Where is she?

17
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,600
It seems she went out
before the meeting.

18
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,520
And she didn't say what for.

19
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,240
I'll go bring her back.

20
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,640
(If you want to know the truth,)

21
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,200
(come to Bohao Cafe.)

22
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,760
Leave immediately.

23
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,680
Why should I?

24
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,400
She will be here soon.

25
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,200
I look forward to seeing
her shocked and angry look.

26
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,320
You're so scheming to harm me.

27
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,000
What on earth do you want?

28
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,000
I want you.

29
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,000
You don't love me at all.

30
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,200
You're sleeping with Mr. Sheng.

31
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,360
Do you think no one knows?

32
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,560
There's a reason for this.

33
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,040
Yingchao, let me explain.

34
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,200
No need to explain.

35
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,960
How many other men
do you have around you?

36
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:24,280
I...

37
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,640
I only love you.

38
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,520
If I make this video public,

39
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,680
do you think
you can stay in the company?

40
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,440
Honey,

41
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,680
I've prepared an anniversary surprise
for you.

42
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,440
Here.

43
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,400
Come on.

44
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,640
I'm sorry, Ms. Luo.

45
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,000
Mr. Meng has been taking care of me.

46
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,520
So I wanted to give you a surprise.

47
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,720
That's right, honey.

48
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,040
I wanted to give you
another anniversary surprise here.

49
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,160
But I didn't expect you
to react that way yesterday.

50
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,560
I was afraid to scare you again.

51
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,800
But Liu didn't know.

52
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,240
So I rushed over to stop it.

53
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,080
Otherwise,

54
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,760
it would cause misunderstandings again.

55
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,560
Then, that photo...

56
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,760
I photoshopped it.

57
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,040
I'm sorry.

58
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,680
Liu, Mr. Sheng
is still waiting for you at the company.

59
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,600
You go ahead.

60
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,160
Anyway, I have already

61
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,040
prepared an anniversary
set meal for you.

62
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,360
Let's tell them to serve.

63
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,640
Then, can you explain

64
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,960
what's with this bank card?

65
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,160
Is this also part of your 'prank'?

66
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,200
What's wrong? Is there a problem?

67
00:05:17,664 --> 00:05:20,096
(Account not activated)

68
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,040
Hello?

69
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,440
So this card can't be used
in this world at all.

70
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,320
Why didn't you say it earlier?

71
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,120
Because you don't belong
to this world at all.

72
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,160
After we get married,

73
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,440
we will have children.

74
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,760
A lot of them.

75
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,800
I don't want to give birth.
It's so painful.

76
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,800
Okay, we won't have kids.

77
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,440
Who are you?

78
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,480
He is not me.

79
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,040
It's me.

80
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,520
Meng Yingchao
has been acting strange lately.

81
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,520
Weiqi,

82
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,720
aren't you a bit overacting?

83
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,640
Well,

84
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,760
he keeps making surprises.

85
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,800
It's almost as if
he's become a different person.

86
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,760
Then do you have any proof

87
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,520
for what you said?

88
00:06:48,096 --> 00:06:49,742
(Honey)

89
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,200
Honey,

90
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,440
I know you're watching.

91
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,200
When exactly are you coming back?

92
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,440
Please come back soon.

93
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,880
Who exactly are you?

94
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,520
Honey,

95
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,640
I miss you so much.

96
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,080
Please come back soon.

97
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,720
It's already dark.

98
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,320
And the food has got cold.

99
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,600
When exactly are you coming back?
