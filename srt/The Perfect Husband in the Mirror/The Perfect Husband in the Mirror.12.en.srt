=The Perfect Husband in the Mirror=

2
00:00:44,928 --> 00:00:47,671
=Episode 12=

3
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,520
I need to talk to your boss.

4
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,200
The new product. I'm treating you.

5
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,560
You are the boss.

6
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,840
I want to chat with you.

7
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,280
Sorry.

8
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,280
At our place,

9
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,720
you have to drink first
before discussing matters.

10
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,960
That's the rule.

11
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,640
I heard you can
help people exchange lives.

12
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,240
What drink is it?

13
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,160
Take it easy.

14
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,840
It's not poisoned.

15
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,480
Miss Luo,

16
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,000
you are not the first woman

17
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,720
who came here seeking an explanation.

18
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,320
Nor will you be the last one.

19
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,040
Instead of living in resentment,

20
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,160
why not try

21
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,560
a different life?

22
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,480
So this is how you
incited my husband, right?

23
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,160
I'm a businesswoman with principles.

24
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,200
I only help my clients
fulfill their wishes.

25
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,760
I don't make choices for them.

26
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,280
See.

27
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,400
If back then,

28
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,800
you hadn't chosen to get married,

29
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,720
but had decided to study abroad instead,

30
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,240
you could have been living
the life in the mirror.

31
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,720
You just saw it.

32
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,840
Inside the mirror, there's another world

33
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,920
with another perfect you.

34
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,280
As long as the contract is signed,

35
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,600
she can come and replace you.

36
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,400
Replacing me?

37
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,320
Yes.

38
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,080
Replacing you.

39
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,040
This way, you can get away
from being an employee and a wife,

40
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,720
get away from those awful identities,

41
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,360
and live a different life,

42
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,760
a perfect life.

43
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,760
Only then can you

44
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,080
retaliate against him.

45
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,440
She's doing so fine.

46
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,840
Will she agree
to exchange lives with me?

47
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,800
That is the greatest
and darkest nature of humans,

48
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,640
being never content.

49
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,720
But as long as you sign the contract,

50
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,840
she can come and replace you.

51
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,800
How long is the term?

52
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,200
Forever

53
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,880
as long as you keep adding credit.

54
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,200
What if I regret it?

55
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,520
The transaction
can be stopped at any time.

56
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,040
What if she doesn't want to end it?

57
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,120
As long as you want her to leave,

58
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,680
you can stand in front of this mirror,

59
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,720
and the other one

60
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,880
will disappear at any time

61
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,840
and never come back.

62
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,680
Wait a moment. Let me check.

63
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,600
My wife has been here.

64
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,080
You know the consequences
of breaking the mirror.

65
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,440
Oh my goodness.

66
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,640
I really should not have doubted you.

67
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:01,560
Then

68
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,680
did you see yourself in that world?

69
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:05,880
Yeah.

70
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,200
She looks so successful.

71
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,080
I do not want to disturb her life.

72
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,800
I will fix

73
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,920
my life myself.

74
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,000
Honey,

75
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,280
when did you come back?

76
00:06:37,792 --> 00:06:38,960
I was looking for you all night.

77
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,600
Hmm.

78
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,040
I had to work overtime
unexpectedly last night.

79
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,240
My phone battery was dead,

80
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,600
so I didn't go back home.

81
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,760
On my way back,
I bought you a piece of clothing.

82
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,520
I thought about it last night.

83
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,320
I think I might have misunderstood you.

84
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,640
Consider it my way
of apologizing to you.

85
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,840
Come in and see if you like it.

86
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,400
It fits quite well.

87
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:09,760
Come over.

88
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,560
Take a look.

89
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,120
Does it fit well?

90
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:14,560
This...

91
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,720
How come this is here?

92
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,880
You mean this mirror?

93
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,840
I just bought this.

94
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,880
Hurry and see

95
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,440
if it suits you.

96
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,040
You are really not him.

97
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,720
Look.

98
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,760
This is a dental clinic voucher.

99
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,640
You've had a crush
on her for four years.

100
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,440
Hurry and make a move,

101
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,320
or she will date the other boys.

102
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,080
I've already inquired for you.

103
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,040
No other ones at this time.

104
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,480
Hurry up and go.

105
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,160
Are you okay?

106
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,400
I'm fine.

107
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:13,600
I...

108
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,480
My name is

109
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,400
Meng Yingchao.

110
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:16,960
I know.

111
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,760
You often follow me.

112
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:21,840
No.

113
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,600
I...

114
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,400
I've been actually into you

115
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,120
for a long time.

116
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,480
This is a dental cleaning voucher.

117
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,760
Are you free this Saturday?

118
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,720
Can we go together?

119
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,240
Sorry.

120
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,520
If you want to pursue me,

121
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,880
I can only apologize.

122
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,320
I have already applied to go abroad.

123
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,720
To go abroad?

124
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,560
I am focusing on my studies right now.

125
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,880
You have your own things too.

126
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,560
Why are you revolving around me?

127
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,320
Going abroad

128
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,600
to open your own dental clinic?

129
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,480
I can contribute.

130
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,240
I have started saving money.

131
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,480
You claim to support me?

132
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,520
Don't you boys have any new moves?

133
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,240
When you like someone,
you are really good at sweet talk.

134
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,800
After winning us over,
you act like you didn't promise.

135
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,880
I only believe myself.

136
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,680
After graduation,

137
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,480
you went abroad.

138
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,840
During that time,

139
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,600
I was drinking every day

140
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,360
just to forget you.

141
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,400
Later, I realized I shouldn't.

142
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,520
I need to pull myself together.

143
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,840
Maybe when you came back to the country,

144
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,800
I still had a chance.

145
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,320
So I pulled myself together

146
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,720
and started desperately
looking for a job.

147
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,480
I changed my name

148
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,720
to Meng Qi.

149
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,080
It means dreaming of Weiqi.

150
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,080
After you came back to the country,

151
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,400
you rejected me again.

152
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,840
You were successful.

153
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,640
I could only watch you from the crowd.

154
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,120
We were worlds apart.

155
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,680
I'd never have a chance again.

156
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:33,960
But one day,

157
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,440
I inadvertently found that bar.
