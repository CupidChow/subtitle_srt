00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,824
=Episode 2=
I've handled everything.

3
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,280
Was it your mother?

4
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:51,920
Then let's go back.

5
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:54,880
It's fine.

6
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,240
I've already told her.

7
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,880
We can stay as long as we like.

8
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:58,720
We don't have to go back.

9
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,880
Really?

10
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,280
The phone call can't get through.

11
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,120
They are not children anymore.

12
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,880
Where did they go?

13
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:11,640
Weiqi,

14
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,320
let's start over.

15
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,200
Why are you doing this? Get up.

16
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,480
You have no idea

17
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,560
how long I've been waiting for this day.

18
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,400
You were not even this excited
when we got married.

19
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,280
(I thought that from this day on,)

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,240
(everything would get better,)

21
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,000
(and he has finally become
the perfect husband.)

22
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,760
Allow me.

23
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,320
There is a camera.

24
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,720
Where is the camera?

25
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,080
I don't see one.

26
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,400
I suddenly feel a bit tired.

27
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,640
Let's go home first.

28
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,200
Okay.

29
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,840
You go take a shower first
and wait for me.

30
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:46,520
Okay.

31
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,640
What?

32
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,080
Sir,

33
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,280
what kind of service would you like?

34
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:28,960
Shh.

35
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,200
Hello?

36
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:41,720
The back seat?

37
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:42,720
I can't see it.

38
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,560
Sir,

39
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,960
what kind of service would you like?

40
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,640
I want it all.

41
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,320
So this is how you played
in the car, huh?

42
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,680
In the car?

43
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,240
Wait.

44
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:31,800
What is this?

45
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,680
You didn't find this in my car, did you?

46
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:34,680
Honey,

47
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,840
you've misunderstood.

48
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,840
Amy just called me,

49
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,040
saying she left her stocking in my car.

50
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,120
I looked for a long time
and couldn't find it.

51
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,320
Why would Amy's stocking be in your car?

52
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,000
You'll have to call Shi

53
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,280
to see what exactly they did
in my car that day.

54
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,680
I couldn't find it, but you did.

55
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,080
I'll get my phone and take a picture

56
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,680
to ask Amy if it's the right one.

57
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,760
It's mine.

58
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,920
You are so beautiful.

59
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,240
It's a work call.

60
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,120
I'll go answer it.

61
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:33,600
Hello?

62
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,080
Didn't I tell you

63
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,440
not to call me now?

64
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,680
Alright, I got it.

65
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,496
See you at the office tomorrow.

66
00:05:56,704 --> 00:05:59,776
(Amy: So let's meet in front
of your company the day after tomorrow?)

67
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,280
So you just believed him?

68
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,600
I'm not that gullible.

69
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,480
I'll be with you.

70
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,120
Take me when you need to catch them.

71
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,000
I will definitely help you take revenge.

72
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,960
The data is hard to recover.

73
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,120
I'll bring you a spare card in a while

74
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,000
to record your driving log first.

75
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,320
How much is this camera?

76
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,200
Hello.

77
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,400
I'm here for Meng Yingchao.

78
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,680
Do you have an appointment?

79
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,640
Tell him

80
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,600
it's Miss Li.

81
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,000
Hello, is Mr. Meng there?

82
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,800
There is a lady in the lobby
looking for him.

83
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,920
Mr. Meng says

84
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,480
he is in a meeting with a client.

85
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,000
Maybe you can contact him later.

86
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,320
I am here.

87
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,400
Amy.

88
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,120
Hello, honey.

89
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,080
Hello.

90
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,160
I happen to be near your company.

91
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:35,920
Do you have time?

92
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,760
Let's meet.

93
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,440
I am currently discussing business
with a client.

94
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,800
Then you go ahead.

95
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:45,720
Let's go.

96
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,080
Okay.

97
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,200
Hello?

98
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:54,920
Come pick me up.

99
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:58,680
What now?

100
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,520
Let's go to my place now.

101
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,360
Okay.

102
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,640
He's even brought her into your home.

103
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,280
I've never seen such a shameless man.

104
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,880
Let me deal with him in a moment.

105
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,520
Honey,

106
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,800
why are you back?

107
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:35,960
Why am I back?

108
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,160
Why are you at home?

109
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:37,760
I...

110
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,960
I came back to get some stuff.

111
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,440
Let me in.

112
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,120
Honey.

113
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,200
Wait a moment.

114
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:42,640
Please.

115
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,280
Why should I wait?

116
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,960
- Why can't I enter my home?
- Wait.

117
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,520
- Wait a moment.
- Why can't I enter my home?
