00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,920
(My name is Luo Weiqi.)

4
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,760
(He is Meng Yingchao.)

5
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,440
(It's our seventh anniversary)

6
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,440
(in a few days.)

7
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,000
Meng Yingchao,

8
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,040
I have endured so much for this family.

9
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,040
Your mother medicates me,

10
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,240
treating me like a breeding machine.

11
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,600
Having no concept of privacy,

12
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,400
she enters our home
as if it were her own.

13
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,440
What have you done

14
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,960
aside from drinking and cheating?

15
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,600
You have the nerve
to call me unreasonable.

16
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,920
I've wanted to divorce you
for a long time.

17
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:24,800
Fine.

18
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,400
Let's get a divorce tomorrow.

19
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:29,880
I've decided.

20
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,080
I can't stand this kind of life
for even one day.

21
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,720
(I thought our marriage
had come to an end.)

22
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,320
(But surprisingly,)

23
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,880
(after that night,)

24
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,280
(everything has changed.)

00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:52,920
Honey.

♪All of these smoke screens haunting♪

30

There you go again.

31
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,760
Stand up.

32
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,400
Let's start over.

33
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,040
Yingchao has changed.

34
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,640
He is nice to me.

35
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,760
He is extremely attentive to me.

36
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,240
I don't know what happened,

37
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,200
but I'd like to fall in love
with you once again.

38
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,480
Don't blame me for being nosy.

39
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,040
There must be something strange
about things going wrong.

40
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,520
Don't worry.

41
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,400
(I won't let her find out.)

42
00:02:27,168 --> 00:02:29,664
♪Step into the, step into the haze♪

43
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,200
(But don't you think
he's being too nice to me?)

44
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,280
You have no idea

45
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,040
how much I love you.

46
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,200
Honey,

47
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,280
I miss you so much.

48
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,360
(He became violent and cold.)

49
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,360
(He has an urge to control me.)

50
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,160
(He's frightening.)

51
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,880
You've been following me
since leaving the clinic?

52
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,040
To protect you.

53
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,440
(Don't you think
Meng Yingchao's recent behavior)

54
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,720
(is not like him?)

55
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,560
(Meng Yingchao is missing.)

56
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,200
(The current Meng Yingchao
is an impostor.)

57
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,960
You are really not him.

♪Don't run from the great unknown♪

60

You just saw it.

61
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,440
Inside the mirror,
there's another world.

62
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,320
As long as the contract is signed,

63
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,720
she can come and replace you.

64
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,120
Replace me?

65
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,400
Someone was working my job

66
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,040
to make money for me.

67
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,520
I can do whatever I want.

68
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,400
I thought his performance
was quite good.

69
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,680
If he wants this marriage,

70
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,880
I'll give it to him.

71
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,080
(I will fix)

72
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,280
(my life myself.)

73
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,520
Meng Yingchao of this world
doesn't love you at all.

74
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,520
Let's go to the seaside.

75
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,520
I can't go.

76
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,320
Do you still love him?

77
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,840
I want to divorce Meng Yingchao.

78
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,840
Leave him to me.

79
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,160
(I will also make him wish he was dead.)

80
00:04:06,752 --> 00:04:08,080
(Paranoid personality disorder)

81
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,480
My name is Meng Yingchao.

82
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,520
They believe

83
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,440
I took kickbacks from our boss!

84
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,720
Meng Yingchao, you crazy?

85
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,640
And even took the boss' woman.

86
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,360
(He's married,)

87
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,040
(yet he's still hitting on me at work.)

88
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,160
Meng Yingchao will return very soon.

89
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:26,880
Honey,

90
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:28,760
it's me.

91
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,160
I'm back.

92
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,880
Let's get a divorce.

93
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,680
The last seven years

94
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,800
were one big farce.

95
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,200
If you make it hard for me,

96
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,400
don't think you can live a good life.

97
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,920
Hello, is this a mental hospital?

98
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,280
There's a mental patient
making a scene here.

99
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,720
Being treated as mentally ill.

100
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,520
How does it feel?

101
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,600
Does it feel good?

102
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,920
I'll help you handle him

103
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:01,960
(and end all this.)

104
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,920
But what do we do now?

105
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:04,880
Let's go.

106
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,040
Where to?

107
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,400
(To restore order.)

108
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,880
(The liar)

109
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,520
(and those who abetted him.)

110
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,240
(No one will escape.)

111
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,520
What do we do next?

112
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,560
(Face the final battle)

113
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,960
(and bid the final farewell.)

114
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,472
(We will hold Yingchao's funeral
this Saturday to say our final goodbyes.)

115
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,240
I want to say today's funeral

116
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,040
is not for Meng Yingchao, but myself.

117
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,240
You unfilial child.

118
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,720
Look what you have done.

119
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,520
(Meng Yingchao,)

120
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,600
(you should take
your responsibility now.)

121
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,800
(The only way to restore
order to this world)

122
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,040
(is to shatter that mirror.)

123
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,280
(Everything has finally ended,)

124
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,320
(and Meng Yingchao has received
his deserved punishment.)

125
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,560
(If you ask me
if I regret getting married,)

126
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,840
(actually, no.)

127
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,200
(Your life)

128
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,600
(always depends on you.)

129
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,200
(My name is Luo Weiqi.)

130
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,680
(My new life has just started.)

131
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,240
(How about you?)
