=Episode 8=

3
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,360
Weiqi, how is it?

4
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,240
Honey.

5
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,280
What took you so long?

6
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,440
You scared us.

7
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,040
How's it?

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,840
Positive.

9
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,720
Mom, alright.

10
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,760
I'll have a grandchild.

11
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,360
Enough, mom.

12
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,040
Don't look at this. It's pretty dirty.

13
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,400
(You don't belong to this world.)

14
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,880
(It's impossible to have a child.)

15
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,280
(Even if there is one,
it won't be yours.)

16
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,160
Yingchao.

17
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,000
Do you still remember

18
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,120
our first child?

19
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,680
Of course he remembers.

20
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,320
You were so busy at work,

21
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,200
and overworked,

22
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,760
the baby even didn't make it

23
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,600
within three months.

24
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,720
Today we are happy,

25
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,720
don't mention

26
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,680
such an unlucky thing.

27
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:11,640
Right.

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,240
I remember at that time,

29
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,600
I was so worried.

30
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,160
Daughter-in-law,

31
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,600
rest assured.

32
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,680
This time, I will take good care of you

33
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,640
to ensure the child is born safely.

34
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,400
Come on, let's eat.

35
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,760
Right, Weiqi.

36
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,480
Eat more.

37
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,120
Yingchao.

38
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,120
Come and pick me up from work tomorrow.

39
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,520
I want to make you a new dental mold.

40
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,800
Okay, no problem.

41
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,520
Honey.

42
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,280
Honey.

43
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:42,840
It's done.

44
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,960
Take a look.

45
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,000
Okay.

46
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,640
How is it?

47
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:04,920
Do you like it?

48
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,520
Yeah.

49
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,400
Yingchao.

50
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,480
I couldn't find you
at your house or at your office.

51
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,440
You didn't answer the phone.

52
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,600
What's wrong, Amy?

53
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,920
Yingchao.

54
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,320
Please.

55
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,960
Please persuade Shi for me, okay?

56
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,320
What happened to Shi?

57
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,440
Haven't you received it yet?

58
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,640
Shi is getting married,

59
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,280
but you are not the bride.

60
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,480
But this surely is not Shi's idea.

61
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,680
He told me once

62
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,880
he only loves me,

63
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,480
and he will never marry anyone else.

64
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,520
Shi is indeed that kind of person.

65
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,560
You don't even know about him.

66
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,120
Yingchao.

67
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,400
Please.

68
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,720
Please help me persuade him.

69
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,320
I...

70
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,040
I really don't know what to do.

71
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,440
Amy, don't flip out.

72
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,800
This is Shi's own decision.

73
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,640
And one can't force
a relationship thing.

74
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,560
You should go.

75
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:07,880
Let's go.

76
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,200
Meng Yingchao.

77
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,040
I tell you I know it clearly.

78
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,160
You did it.

79
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,720
Ever since you took him to that place,

80
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,760
he's become a different person.

81
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,800
That place?

82
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,320
I don't know what you're saying.

83
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,200
Did you know
Shi is going to marry long ago?

84
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,120
Don't you know
what kind of person Shi is?

85
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,120
I have no other choice.

86
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:41,840
Honey.

87
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,480
I need to refuel the car.

88
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,720
You go upstairs first.

89
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,960
Why did you call me back?

90
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,000
I did ask you to come back,

91
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,120
but I didn't ask you
to come back so blatantly.

92
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,560
She almost saw you.

93
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,000
Don't you think this is exciting?

94
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,320
Even your mom knows.

95
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,720
- She wants to see you.
- Just for this?

96
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,920
She'll keep it a secret.

97
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,600
Tell her I'm all right.

98
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,080
Don't contact me if it's not necessary.

99
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:19,880
I'm very busy.

100
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,240
And...

101
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:26,840
What's wrong?

102
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,240
I'll take care of her for you.

103
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,600
Rest assured.

104
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,360
Hello, Weiqi.

105
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,040
I have done the thing

106
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,920
you asked me to do.

107
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:46,880
How is it?

108
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,200
These two dental molds
are completely different.

109
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,480
What's wrong, honey?

110
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:30,960
You had a nightmare?

111
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,160
I'm okay.

112
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,040
Let's go welcome the bride.

113
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,480
This wedding can't be held.

114
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,280
Because the groom is an impostor.

115
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,120
The real Shi was
switched out by someone.

116
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,800
Shi is my man.

117
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,000
I wasn't with him for very long,

118
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,840
but I have loved him for five years.

119
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,560
He can't suddenly fall in love

120
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,240
with a woman no one knows.

121
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,840
This man is definitely not Shi.

122
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,680
What are you talking about?

123
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,440
Get her out of here now.

124
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,520
This man...

125
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,720
He is really cruel.

126
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,680
Open your eyes and take a good look.

127
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,560
I think I left something in there.

128
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,160
I'll go get it.

129
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,360
Okay, I'll bring the car over.

130
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,000
Hmm.

131
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,240
Shi.

132
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,240
What's the matter?

133
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,640
I want to wish you a happy wedding.

134
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,640
Thank you.

135
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,080
Well...

136
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,520
Sorry for making a fool of myself

137
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,680
in front of you.

138
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,400
Have you really known
the bride for long?

139
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,480
Why didn't you mention her
to me and Yingchao?

140
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,040
We've known each other for a long time.

141
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,840
Shi.

142
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,280
I'm coming.
