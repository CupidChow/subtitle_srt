=The Perfect Husband in the Mirror=

2
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,280
=Episode 18=

3
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,400
What's with this?

4
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,600
To avoid unwelcome developments,

5
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,880
I've packed up everything at home.

6
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,560
Let's go to the seaside.

7
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,440
I can't go.

8
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:56,960
What's wrong?

9
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,520
Didn't we agree on this?

10
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,240
After I settle everything
with Meng Yingchao,

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,200
we leave here and go far away.

12
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,200
But,

13
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,200
we haven't settled things between us.

14
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,320
He doesn't think he did anything wrong.

15
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,320
He still thinks I'm messing with him.

16
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,920
Isn't the outcome the same?

17
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,840
It's not the same.

18
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,800
He thinks he is the victim.

19
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,880
He thinks me and this marriage
are to blame.

20
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,400
I won't leave if he doesn't come around.

21
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:27,920
Do you still love him?

22
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,680
I don't love him. I hate him.

23
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,720
I just think he has lost
far less than I have.

24
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,600
I'll help you handle him
and put an end to all this.

25
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,880
This is between him and me.

26
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,000
It's a matter between spouses.

27
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,200
Stay out of it.

28
00:01:54,528 --> 00:01:56,416
(Kanglan Mental Hospital)

29
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,840
It's not visiting hours yet.

30
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,240
Please wait outside.

31
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,320
My son is inside.

32
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,680
Let go of me.

33
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,840
Let me go.

34
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,080
- Another sedative injection.
- This is murder.

35
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,080
I'll sue you.

36
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,240
I'm going to sue you
and have you all put in jail.

37
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,000
Let go of me.

38
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,000
Release my son.

39
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,560
Get out of my way!

40
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,560
Doctor, I beg you.

41
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,320
Can you reexamine my son?

42
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,680
I'm sure he's not sick.

43
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,240
I swear on my life.

44
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,600
He has a tendency to kill people.

45
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,520
The guardian requests
full confinement treatment.

46
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,480
Am I not my son's guardian?

47
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,120
Your son is married.

48
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,800
His wife is the guardian.

49
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,840
And that appraisal report.

50
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,120
That report is definitely fake.

51
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,560
There is a person
who looks exactly like my son.

52
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,920
He did it.

53
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,280
Doctor!

54
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,760
Doctor!

55
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,720
- May I ask
- Doctor!

56
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,600
- which ward Meng Yingchao is in?
- Let me explain.

57
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,520
- Doctor!
- I'm his wife.

58
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,640
Do you have an appointment?

59
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,520
I'm his legal guardian,
applying for accompaniment.

60
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,240
Please wait a moment.

61
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,040
You have the nerve to come?

62
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,040
What do you want?

63
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,640
Do you still want your son to go out?

64
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,200
He goes crazy when he sees you.

65
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,720
You should go.
I'm here to accompany him.

66
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,120
You came to accompany him?

67
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,200
It was you who did this to him.

68
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:24,640
You...

69
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,240
Being treated as mentally ill.

70
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,160
How does it feel? Is it good?

71
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,400
Are you satisfied now?

72
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,960
Why would I be satisfied?

73
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,120
My family has become like this.

74
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,120
The person I once loved the most
is lying in a bed in a mental hospital.

75
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,280
I have lost my job.

76
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,080
My life is a complete mess.

77
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,760
What can I be happy about?

78
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,360
Is that because of me?

79
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,520
Because of me.

80
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,920
Because I realized it too late.

81
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,960
If you hadn't taken things
to such an extreme,

82
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,320
things wouldn't have turned out
this way today.

83
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,920
What spell did you cast on Meng Qi?

84
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,880
He ran to our company and made a scene.

85
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,000
He forged
a mental illness certificate for me.

86
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,760
He has ruined my reputation.

87
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,720
You haven't fallen for him, have you?

88
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,320
Let me tell you.

89
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,000
He is just my stand-in.

90
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,480
Sooner or later,

91
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,360
he will disappear from this world.

92
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,160
Meng Yingchao,

93
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,440
isn't Meng Qi just you?

94
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,400
The two of you

95
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,840
are the same.

96
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,120
Neither of you two is any good.

97
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,720
When you arranged for him
to be by my side,

98
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,360
you should have considered

99
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,080
that it would lead to
such consequences today.

100
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,440
Someone!

101
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,520
Someone!

102
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,600
Let me out!

103
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,000
Sorry.

104
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,760
My husband has another episode.

105
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,640
Lady.

106
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,200
It's you.

107
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:06,920
Have a drink.

108
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,440
I am here for after-sales service.
