00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,000
=The Perfect Husband in the Mirror=

2
00:00:44,864 --> 00:00:47,466
=Episode 5=

3
00:00:59,200 --> 00:00:59,800
You've known

4
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,000
about the surveillance.

5
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,720
Why do you pretend you don't know?

6
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,400
You have no idea

7
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,200
how much I love you.

8
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,080
This is not love.

9
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,520
Then tell me what this is.

10
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,000
I know we've all
been through a lot lately,

11
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,640
and you are tired.

12
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,400
How about this?

13
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,160
We move to a place by the sea.

14
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,240
How's that?

15
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,600
By the sea?

16
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,480
Yes.

17
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,040
Why?

18
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,720
There is a transfer opportunity
in our company right now.

19
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,160
Didn't you say

20
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,040
you want to live by the sea?

21
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,000
Then we'll find a place

22
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,360
by the sea where no one knows us

23
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,640
and start over.

24
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,600
What do you think?

25
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,120
I can't leave.

26
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,720
Why?

27
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,200
I might be pregnant.

28
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,840
I've been lazy lately,

29
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,480
wanted to vomit,

30
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,960
and craved sour food.

31
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,400
You're pregnant?

32
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,760
That's great.

33
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,600
I need to buy a baby crib and stroller.

34
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,120
And we have to change the house.

35
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,160
This house isn't big enough.

36
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,360
Honey.

37
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:50,880
Did you do the test?

38
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,840
Not yet.

39
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,520
Not yet?

40
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,120
Then I'll go buy it now.

41
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,720
Don't hurry.

42
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,040
I'm a bit tired now.

43
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:01,880
Let's do it tomorrow.

44
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,400
We're about to have our first child.

45
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,320
That's great.

46
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,760
First child?

47
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,840
(Seven Years Ago)

48
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,240
What time is the patient's
appointment this afternoon?

49
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,560
That appointment has been
changed to 1:30 PM.

50
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,520
Dr. Luo.

51
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,640
Right away.

52
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,040
Weiqi.

53
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,040
Are you okay?

54
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,760
My stomach hurts.

55
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,840
Yes, that proposal can
be submitted tonight.

56
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,400
Mr. Sheng, please wait.

57
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,360
How is it? Is the child okay?

58
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,760
The child has gone.

59
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,560
What took you so long?

60
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,080
How dare you ask so!

61
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,640
It's good that Weiqi is okay.

62
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,720
Don't you remember?

63
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,720
What?

64
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,080
Tonight,

65
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,160
you just sleep on the sofa.

66
00:05:21,568 --> 00:05:24,832
(If a person suddenly changes
his personality, he might have MPD.)

67
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,040
Hello, Li Ke.

68
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,440
Do you suspect Meng
has multiple personality disorder?

69
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,360
Don't you think Meng Yingchao

70
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,720
has changed a lot?

71
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,000
You scared me.

72
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,760
Are you looking for me?

73
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,880
You've been very busy lately.

74
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,040
You didn't answer my phone,

75
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,240
or reply to my messages.

76
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,080
What's the matter?

77
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,680
I have to buy something for Weiqi.

78
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,640
Weiqi, Weiqi.

79
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,400
So sweet.

80
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,680
How is she?

81
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,080
Pretty good.

82
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,720
I've handled Liu Yuyun's matter for you.

83
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,520
Why don't you even thank me?

84
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,920
You need to get this straight.

85
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,240
You did so

86
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,920
to do yourself a favor too.

87
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,720
I think you've been
getting carried away lately.

88
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:56,800
Let me tell you.

89
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,320
Stay away from my home.

90
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,480
Your home?

91
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,320
Don't get it wrong.

92
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,720
You're just my stand-in.

93
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,880
He's been nice to you,

94
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,600
and this is good.

95
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,120
Yes, he's been nice to me.

96
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,360
But he became violent and cold,

97
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,440
with strong desire to control,

98
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,320
which is frightening.

99
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,240
Son.

100
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,320
Mom.

101
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,040
Who's that?

102
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,080
A friend of mine.

103
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:32,760
It's fine.

104
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,600
Mom, let's go back.

105
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,800
Maybe you should get some sleep.

106
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,120
Tomorrow

107
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,360
I'll meet a friend for a meal.

108
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,600
He's a psychologist.

109
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,480
Just nearby.

110
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,160
Do you

111
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,440
want to join us?

112
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,640
Psychologist?

113
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,520
What do you mean?

114
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,720
Oh, nothing.

115
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,680
Don't overthink.

116
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,000
Honey.

117
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,800
I have to hang up. Let's chat tomorrow.

118
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:27,720
It's fine.

119
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,320
I've already taken a leave
to the clinic for you today.

120
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,280
Why did you take a leave for me?

121
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,080
You've said so.

122
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,000
Be careful in the first few months.

123
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,640
I have several tooth extractions
scheduled today.

124
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,120
I have to go to the clinic.

125
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,000
I'm leaving.

126
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,240
I'll stay at Li Ke's place tonight.

127
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,280
Maybe you should stay home tonight.

128
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,280
I'll pick you up if it's too late.

129
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,200
I can't break the appointment.

130
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,440
I do not lie to you.

131
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,080
Money is not a problem,

132
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,400
and everything is ready.

133
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:00,520
Just...

134
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,840
Just give me more time.

135
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,640
I want to refund.

136
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,760
I have to complain against her.

137
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,560
I did a teeth cleaning here,

138
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,480
but you wanted to get my teeth out.

139
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,640
How did you become a doctor?

140
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,800
This hospital is so terrible.

141
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,520
Where's the director?

142
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,080
You two are just going to
stare at me all day

143
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,720
and wait for me to leave, right?

144
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,560
You let me bleed all day.
What if I'm out of blood?

145
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,320
I'm about to pass out.

146
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,280
That doctor is Dr. Luo, right?

147
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,520
Tell her not to be a dentist
if she is not capable.

148
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,880
Let me tell you, if I see her again,

149
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,560
I'll complain against
your entire clinic.

150
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,400
Are you looking for trouble?

151
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,720
Are you the one who complained Dr. Luo?

152
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,080
What? Can't I speak frankly?

153
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,480
You can't

154
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,280
complain against her.
