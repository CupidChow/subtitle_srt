=The Perfect Husband in the Mirror=

2
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:47,616
=Episode 17=

3
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,280
You're pregnant
but still flirting with another man.

4
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,000
You have no shame at all!

5
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,840
Do you have any evidence?

6
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,040
Do you?

7
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,280
What more evidence do you want?

8
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,520
What evidence do you want?

9
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,680
Look how intimate you are.

10
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,160
And the tie he has around his neck.

11
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:18,920
This tie

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,280
is a gift from the clinic

13
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,920
to the doctors and the patients.

14
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,440
Can't a therapist get a dental cleaning?

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,480
Dr. Luo only went
to the front desk to fetch it for me.

16
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,040
Dr. Jiang came to get
a dental cleaning from me.

17
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,400
I just went out to run some errands.

18
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,840
Weiqi was assisting me.

19
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,920
Assisting you with what?

20
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,280
She has already resigned.

21
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,000
Why would she assist you?

22
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,400
My forced resignation
involves Dr. Jiang.

23
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,680
Of course, I should come to him.

24
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,360
What?

25
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,280
Well,

26
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,080
the one who reported her
anonymously was you, right?

27
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,200
This...

28
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,880
Since we're on the subject,

29
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,280
let's make it clear.

30
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,720
Meng Yingchao,

31
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,520
because of your possessiveness,

32
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,320
you made the relationship
between me and Dr. Jiang seem so bad.

33
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,040
You spread rumors online.

34
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,440
You even pretended to be my patient

35
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,040
and complained and framed me,
causing me to resign.

36
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,960
Now you are pulling the same old trick.

37
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,040
What do you really want to do?

38
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:25,480
This...

39
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,480
It's not him. It is...

40
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,000
Who is it?

41
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,960
Anyway, don't talk nonsense.

42
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,480
I just saw you two
being intimate right here.

43
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,640
I wanted to save you some face
in front of these people around,

44
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,360
but you've gone too far.

45
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,360
Meng Yingchao,

46
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,560
is the gin good?

47
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,720
Didn't you say
that he acted like you very well?

48
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,960
Didn't you say you wanted
to give him your marriage?

49
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,160
Let's get a divorce.

50
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,400
For the sake of the baby,

51
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,400
just forgive him once.

52
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,800
Forgive him?

53
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,200
Then who'll compensate for my marriage,

54
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,480
my career, everything I've lost?

55
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,720
The baby is innocent.

56
00:03:47,885 --> 00:03:50,304
(Kanglan People's Hospital Lab Results:
Negative, Not Pregnant)

57
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,080
There isn't a baby at all.

58
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,880
If not, would she go to see you?

59
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,160
Would you go home?

60
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,160
Mom.

61
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,680
You are uniting to trap me up.

62
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,520
To first ruin my reputation,

63
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,120
and now you are forcing me
to divorce, aren't you?

64
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,880
Meng Yingchao, you've had enough.

65
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,880
Just because Weiqi doesn't say anything,
you think she's easy to bully?

66
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,000
You are the many,

67
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,720
banding together to pick on us.

68
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,720
You are too cruel.

69
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,640
You lied to us about being pregnant.

70
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,960
Now you are banding
together to trick us.

71
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,640
He is 30 years old,

72
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,360
but he can't even feed himself

73
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,440
or wash his own underwear.

74
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,040
Your indulgence made him the man he is.

75
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,280
Weiqi.

76
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,280
Yingchao.

77
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,120
Stay away.

78
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,160
Everyone get out!

79
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,320
Yingchao.

80
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,640
Yingchao.

81
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:43,840
Yingchao.

82
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,440
Don't stop me.

83
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,880
Yingchao.

84
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,800
What do you want?

85
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,000
What do I want?

86
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,600
What do you want?

87
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,760
This is what you want, isn't it?

88
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,840
You're driving me crazy.

89
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,040
You're trying
to drive me crazy, aren't you?

90
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,440
Yingchao, don't be rash.

91
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,040
Meng Yingchao,

92
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,600
I know all about you
going to the New Club.

93
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,160
You planted a fake one by my side
and you have the nerve to say

94
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,440
all of this was caused by me!

95
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,600
Even if all of this is my fault,

96
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,120
can't you just talk nicely to me?

97
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,280
Do you have to make
such a fuss about this?

98
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,800
Are you happy to see this mess now?

99
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,400
Hello.

100
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,680
Is this a mental hospital?

101
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,280
There's a mental patient
making a scene here.

102
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,120
Someone's gonna get hurt soon.

103
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,840
At Yameijia Clinic.

104
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,200
In the corridor outside,

105
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,840
I lost my first child.

106
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,720
I didn't go abroad
for the sake of our relationship.

107
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,000
And you?

108
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,920
Three days after my miscarriage,
you were with Shi

109
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,840
in a bar, holding hands
with a strange woman.

110
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,640
Mr. Sheng, please wait.

111
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,720
How is it? Is the child okay?

112
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,000
You know I have hemophobia.

113
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I can't be of any use here.

114
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,600
Mom has made chicken soup at home.

115
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,480
You should take a good rest.

116
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,560
I have a meeting to attend.

117
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,880
You don't remember, do you?

118
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,320
I really regret it.

119
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,360
I regret not exposing you.

120
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,760
Let's divorce

121
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,320
and make all of this public.

122
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,240
The last seven years

123
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,280
were one big farce.

124
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,640
No.

125
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,680
I will not divorce you.

126
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,400
If you make it hard for me,

127
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,280
don't think you can live a good life.

128
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,480
Yingchao.

129
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,840
Hurry in and persuade him.

130
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,480
Hurry in.

131
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,240
What's wrong?

132
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,280
Go in. What are you doing?

133
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,960
Stop taking photos.

134
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,240
Yingchao.

135
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,360
Yingchao.

136
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,440
Yingchao.

137
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,760
Yingchao.

138
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,600
Severe paranoid personality disorder.

139
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,960
Distorting facts
and starting having delusions.

140
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,280
Suspecting his spouse
of being unfaithful.

141
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,480
Attacking and monitoring his spouse.

142
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,200
Even showing violent
and aggressive behavior.

143
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:21,920
Take him away now.

144
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,840
Yingchao.

145
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,160
Meng Yingchao is really odious.

146
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,160
You've endured for seven years.
It's been hard on you.

147
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,200
This is not a long-term solution.

148
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,560
Weiqi, you can file for divorce.

149
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,280
It's not time yet.

150
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,200
Why?

151
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,600
Are you okay?

152
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,400
Why are you here again?

153
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,720
He is not Meng Yingchao.

154
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,760
You are not Meng Yingchao?

155
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,680
I want to talk to my wife

156
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,600
face to face.

157
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,760
First, she is not your wife.

158
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:11,640
Second,

159
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,760
we don't think it's safe
for her to be alone with you.

160
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,480
So we'll talk here

161
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,520
or at home?

162
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,400
I'll go home with you.

163
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,440
Weiqi.

164
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,320
Don't worry.

165
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,000
Let's go.
