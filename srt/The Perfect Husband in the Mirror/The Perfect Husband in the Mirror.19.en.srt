=The Perfect Husband in the Mirror=

2
00:00:45,036 --> 00:00:47,600
=Episode 19=

3
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,200
Lady.

4
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,080
It's you.

5
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,840
Have a drink.

6
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,320
I am here for after-sales service.

7
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,560
After-sales service?

8
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,480
What after-sales service?

9
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,080
I want Meng Qi

10
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,280
back to where he belongs.

11
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,160
Sorry.

12
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,920
The signatory
has to terminate it proactively.

13
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,360
Otherwise, we don't have the right.

14
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,720
The signatory is now missing.

15
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,560
My life is a mess.

16
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,080
You have no reason to refuse.

17
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,120
Miss Luo,

18
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,360
let me be clear.

19
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,680
I have no right
to terminate this agreement.

20
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,640
Everyone,

21
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,840
you either are exchanging your lives

22
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,600
or have already exchanged your lives.

23
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:02,800
Do you really think

24
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,120
you can shirk all responsibilities
in this way?

25
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,240
The New Club is filthy.

26
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,720
What's behind it
is selfishness and cowardliness.

27
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,600
Giving your lives to strangers,

28
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,880
you are truly detestable and pathetic.

29
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,680
Ask yourselves.

30
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,240
How can you face those who love you?

31
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,040
What else do you want?

32
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,720
I'm almost driven mad by you.

33
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,360
What else do you want?

34
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,040
As long as you're alive,

35
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,400
Weiqi won't start over with me.

36
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,120
They will use your bodies

37
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,680
to do all kinds of bad things.

38
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,200
You will never be able to go home.

39
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,240
Let go of me.

40
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,800
I can walk by myself.

41
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,040
Remember this.

42
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,720
You are just my stand-in.

43
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,280
Do you know this?

44
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,280
Luo Weiqi told me personally just now

45
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,440
that I'm the only one she loves.

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,920
I'm wondering.

47
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,920
Aren't you afraid

48
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,440
of waking up next to a stranger someday?

49
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,360
Are you okay?

50
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,560
Yes.

51
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,080
There's a fire! Run!

52
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,720
Don't touch me.

53
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,280
My son is inside.

54
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,920
Don't touch me.

55
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,360
My son is inside.

56
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,080
I must save my son.

57
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,080
Let me go!

58
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,240
Move aside. I must save my son!

59
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,520
Move aside!

60
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,000
You came out.

61
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,560
Where is my son?

62
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,400
Leave us alone.

63
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,360
Meng Qi,

64
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,480
stop pretending.

65
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,400
I fooled the doctor.

66
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,200
But I can't fool you.

67
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,800
Where is Meng Yingchao?

68
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,480
He's dead.

69
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,160
Impossible.

70
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,680
Isn't this what you want?

71
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,000
After he's completely gone,

72
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,240
we'll leave together.

73
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,880
Meng Qi, didn't I say

74
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,760
I will make this cowardly husband

75
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,200
admit his mistakes in front of everyone?

76
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,160
I love you so much.

77
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,840
Isn't this enough?

78
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,800
Love me?

79
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,560
The girl you love
is Luo Weiqi in another world

80
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,240
who rejected you.

81
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,040
You're just like Meng Yingchao.

82
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,680
Both of you

83
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,480
pursue the girl you want

84
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,600
because of your obsessions and desire.

85
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,520
You both hurt me again and again.

86
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,000
What are you talking about?

87
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,680
I hurt people and set a fire.

88
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,480
I did it all for you.

89
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,440
For me?

90
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,320
Stop being so self-righteous.

91
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,520
We have to put an end to this.

92
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,400
How can we leave now?

93
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,560
Now that Meng Yingchao is dead,
what do you want me to do?

94
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,840
So this is the reason.

95
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,440
Alright.

96
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,960
I'm gonna tell you something.

97
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,560
Mom.

98
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,400
What is this?

99
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,680
What else could it be?

100
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,080
It's Yingchao's ashes.

101
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,120
Impossible!

102
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,920
How could this happen?

103
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,680
I see.

104
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,400
I believe you.

105
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,800
Is what you said true?

106
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,480
Of course.

107
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,560
But I still
want to put an end to this relationship.

108
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,880
Let everyone know it's over
between me and him.

109
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,120
Then I can leave with you.

110
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,680
It hasn't been easy to come this far.

111
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,440
We can't afford to make any mistake now.

112
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,720
If you really need an explanation,

113
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,280
he must "die".

114
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,760
Mom.

115
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,720
Alright.

116
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,440
Don't be sad.

117
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,080
We both need

118
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,160
to pull ourselves together now.

119
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,440
We need to hold a funeral for him.

120
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,920
Let him die with dignity.

121
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,400
Right?

122
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,320
Okay.

123
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,680
I'll listen to you.

124
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,520
(My husband,)

125
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,040
(Meng Yingchao, died in a fire.)

126
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,960
(We will hold his funeral this Saturday)

127
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,240
(to say our final goodbyes.)

128
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,040
What are you doing here? Hurry.

129
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,640
Stay with Yingchao. Go.

130
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,160
Is anyone home?

131
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,120
Hello?

132
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,520
Is anyone home?

133
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,840
Shi has left.

134
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,600
I told you long ago.

135
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,520
People like Shi and Meng Yingchao

136
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,640
will never turn over a new leaf.

137
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,880
If you're here to mock me, please leave.

138
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,400
Don't you feel sad?

139
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,840
Do you think you deserve
to be abandoned like a rag?

140
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,040
Come with me now.

141
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,680
Let's expose their true colors.

142
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:52,600
You...

143
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,200
I'll be right back after dressing up.

144
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,080
Weiqi,

145
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,280
all is going well.
