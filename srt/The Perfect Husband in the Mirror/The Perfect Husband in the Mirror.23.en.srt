00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,488
=Episode 23=

3
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,520
Honey,

4
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,280
you're back.

5
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,680
What are you doing here?

6
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,120
Waiting for you to come back.

7
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:01,960
Oh, right.

8
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,440
I made your favorite, white fungus
and lotus seed thick soup.

9
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,640
No need. I don't want to eat.

10
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,680
You eat it yourself.

11
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,480
I'll bring it over for you.

12
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,480
Honey.

13
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:28,960
Honey.

14
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,640
Why was it such a hassle to revoke

15
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,080
a household registration cancellation?

16
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,400
They asked for this document
and that document.

17
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,160
Thankfully, it was finally settled.

18
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,760
Your name was changed too.

19
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,320
This is giving you a chance

20
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,240
to start over your life.

21
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,760
Got it?

22
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,760
Honey,

23
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,440
you're back.

24
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,080
Honey.

25
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,840
Honey,

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,880
I even wrote a pledge.

27
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,560
Do you want to take a look?

28
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,680
If you want,

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,320
I will send it to everyone.

30
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,640
I've really decided
I want to be a better person

31
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,480
and forever faithful to you.

32
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,880
I really know I was wrong, honey.

33
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,040
Mom.

34
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,040
Mom, what are you doing?

35
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,280
Even if we were wrong,

36
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,880
we should make it clear.

37
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,440
If you want to divorce, hurry up.

38
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,760
Constantly getting the cold shoulder
when we try to please you.

39
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,760
How can we go on like this?

40
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:53,880
Open the door.

41
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,360
Mom.

42
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,640
Mom.

43
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,280
Mom.

44
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,120
- Get up, Mom.
- What are you doing?

45
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,360
Others might think I'm abusing an elder.

46
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,920
Weiqi,

47
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,720
I've never kneeled down to anyone,

48
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,640
but for my son,

49
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,040
I pushed it today.

50
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,080
I'm begging you.

51
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,800
Please give Yingchao a chance.

52
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,840
Life has to go on.

53
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,920
Mom.

54
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,280
Holding grudges will only hurt yourself.

55
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,080
If you dislike me,

56
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,000
I will sell the house
and move somewhere else.

57
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,520
I'll move far away from you.

58
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,840
I won't interfere with
your life anymore.

59
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,160
Is that okay?

60
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,800
Are you still making
excuses for him even now?

61
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,880
See if there's anything else to add.

62
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,200
This...

63
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,680
It's no use even if you tear it up.

64
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,160
I can sue.

65
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,560
I can't act like nothing has happened.

66
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,880
Meng Yingchao
can't escape paying the price.

67
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,720
I'm going to start my new life.

68
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,600
The money you owe,
and the mistakes you've made.

69
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,000
Bear the consequences yourself.

70
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:55,280
It's all on you!

71
00:05:25,088 --> 00:05:28,000
(Notification of failing the interview)

72
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,280
Hello.

73
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,720
Hello, I submitted
a resume to your company before.

74
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,680
My name is Meng Yingchao.
Could you check for me?

75
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,960
I received an email today.
You rejected my application.

76
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,080
I'd still like to try and fight for it.

77
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,400
I really have
a lot of successful project experience.

78
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,440
I feel I am a good fit for your company.

79
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,800
Well, Mr. Meng.

80
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,680
We reviewed your experience,

81
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,760
and we think you're good.

82
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,480
However, there are
some rumors about you.

83
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,200
So we hope you can understand.

84
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,960
Hello?

85
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,560
Hello, sir.

86
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,080
This is Yingchao.

87
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,840
I've asked you to help me find a job.

88
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,440
May I inquire about the progress?

89
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,400
It's you, Meng.

90
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,720
I have submitted your resume,

91
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,360
but upon hearing your name,

92
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,160
everyone

93
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,280
shook their head.

94
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,400
Bad news spreads far and wide.

95
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,160
One must not slip up
at any point in life.

96
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,480
Who are you?

97
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:03,920
Excuse me,

98
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,840
I want to see Mr. Sheng.

99
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,760
Mr. Sheng?

100
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,080
You think anyone can see Mr. Sheng?

101
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,800
I used to work here.

102
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,800
Or I want to see Mr. Shi.

103
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,840
Mr. Shi Feiyu.

104
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,920
Get out.

105
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,840
Go away.

106
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,000
- Wait.
- Leave.

107
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,240
I really worked here before.

108
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:17,600
I...

109
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,640
Leave.

110
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,160
Hi, Shi.

111
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,480
This is Yingchao.

112
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,080
- Bro,
- I...

113
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,280
you did me dirty enough.

114
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,040
Now I'm married to someone I don't love.

115
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,280
I am ruined,

116
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,120
and I've been grounded
with my allowance limited.

117
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,440
Get lost.

118
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,400
You're no longer my friend.

119
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,160
No. Let me explain. Hey.

120
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,360
Hello?

121
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:14,960
Hello.

122
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,720
Sorry.

123
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,600
The subscriber
you dialed is unavailable.

124
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,760
Please try again later.

125
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,320
Sorry.

126
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,920
The subscriber you dialed...

127
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,400
Hello, I am Meng Yingchao.

128
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,280
Here is my resume.

129
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,840
Hello, here is my resume.
