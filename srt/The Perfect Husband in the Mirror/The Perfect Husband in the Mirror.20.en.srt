Weiqi,

3
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,032
(Mourn)
are you sure you've informed everyone?

4
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,480
I'm sure.

5
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,920
I called all the colleagues

6
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,360
and friends.

7
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,440
I've invited them.

8
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,120
I also informed the neighbors
from door to door.

9
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,360
They still haven't arrived yet.

10
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,056
Maybe they are on their way.

11
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,640
On their way?

12
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,160
It's already noon.

13
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,600
The ceremony is about to begin.

14
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,320
Weiqi, I'm here.

15
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,920
I'm glad you came.

16
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,240
What are you doing?

17
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,440
Some friends and classmates
can't make it,

18
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,600
so I asked Li Ke to help them
say goodbyes via live stream.

19
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,000
In awe of life and death,

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,440
let's show our condolences
for Mr. Meng Yingchao for three minutes.

21
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,240
Next, the family members,
please come forward and speak.

22
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,400
My son

23
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,640
was good-natured

24
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,640
and had a successful career.

25
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,320
He was filial to me

26
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,400
and loved his wife.

27
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,240
His death

28
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,480
is a great loss

29
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,800
to his family

30
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,080
and friends.

31
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,360
His existence is a great loss to us.

32
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,240
He deserved it.

33
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,040
I just want you to be happy.

34
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,480
But what about you?

35
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,680
Think for me.

36
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,040
Okay?

37
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,600
They were selfish.

38
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,560
They only loved themselves.

39
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,680
During the past seven years,

40
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,000
this kind of thing happened every day.

41
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,400
I want to say today's funeral

42
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,000
is not for Meng Yingchao, but myself.

43
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,120
It's for saying goodbye to my old self.

44
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,400
Please take this as a warning, guys.

45
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,400
Some people

46
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,720
want a family
but don't want to be responsible.

47
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,280
They want a good wife
but don't want to be a good husband.

48
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,200
They want
a life of both stability and debauchery.

49
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,760
They will end up like this man.

50
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,080
Luo Weiqi,

51
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,960
Yingchao is your husband after all!

52
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,960
He has become like this

53
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,800
because you spoiled him
and turned a blind eye.

54
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,320
You...

55
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,160
You're slandering us.

56
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,640
That's nonsense!

57
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,920
That's because
they don't know Meng Yingchao well.

58
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,080
Who are you?

59
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,680
Auntie,

60
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,880
perhaps you don't know me.

61
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,360
But Yingchao and I
have known each other for long.

62
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,720
I've never seen you before.

63
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,600
Auntie,

64
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,440
well,

65
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,440
Yingchao suddenly died,

66
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,520
and you're all alone.

67
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,600
Auntie,

68
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,400
let me speak with Yingchao
for a few more words.

69
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,720
Liu Yuyun,

70
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,240
I asked you here

71
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,840
because I think

72
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,480
maybe you really loved Meng Yingchao.

73
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,920
Don't push your luck.

74
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,120
Don't listen to her.

75
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,760
Meng Yingchao.
