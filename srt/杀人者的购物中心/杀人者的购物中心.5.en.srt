1
00:00:16,058 --> 00:00:18,560
What the fuck? Just my luck.

2
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,158
Hello.

3
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:39,873
I...

4
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,252
I saw your part-time job ad.

5
00:00:45,087 --> 00:00:47,256
STORAGE ORGANIZATION
AND SIMPLE TASKS

6
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:48,841
My name is Bae Jeongmin.

7
00:00:49,508 --> 00:00:50,592
I know who you are.

8
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:53,345
I went to elementary school with Jian.

9
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:03,605
A SHOP FOR KILLERS

10
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:08,861
EPISODE 5
BABYLON

11
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,488
How does this even work?

12
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,033
I wasn't talking to you.

13
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:22,207
How many times do I have to tell you?
Seriously.

14
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:26,420
Do you know how many times I almost died?

15
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,549
Anyway, I'm inside.

16
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:35,262
You saw the picture of Jian, right?

17
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:39,766
I'll activate murthehelp's source
and get it to you today.

18
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,935
Handing over this shopping mall
in just three days.

19
00:01:43,312 --> 00:01:45,189
I'm the number one contributor to that.

20
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:53,947
What?

21
00:01:54,907 --> 00:01:55,908
You want me...

22
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:58,785
to kill her?

23
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:06,835
<i>What?</i>

24
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,755
<i>You've come this far
and now you can't do it?</i>

25
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,425
<i>Is that all you're made of?</i>

26
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:38,492
What do you mean?

27
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:42,246
You locked me in?

28
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:45,707
What?

29
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:48,335
That's what you just said.

30
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,587
When we were younger,

31
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:53,257
you were the one that locked me
in the storage room.

32
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:58,762
Oh, that?

33
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:06,144
Jeong Jinman!

34
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:09,064
Jeong Jinman!

35
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:15,195
I was just curious...

36
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:20,158
if you were really a mute or not.

37
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:22,578
So I talked some friends
into locking you in.

38
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:25,497
I thought you'd be able to speak
in an extreme situation.

39
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,001
You should be thanking me.

40
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,378
You overcame your aphasia, thanks to me.

41
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:42,764
You're confused, aren't you?

42
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:46,518
You must be confused
about what's going on.

43
00:03:46,602 --> 00:03:47,603
Am I right?

44
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:53,817
Something you could've never imagined
is happening. It's understandable.

45
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:57,696
What the hell are you saying?

46
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:04,953
Don't you want to know?

47
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,665
About what's going on right now.

48
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:16,048
There's a place called Babylon.

49
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:21,011
You moron.

50
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:23,764
There aren't any killers in our country.

51
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,683
You saw the deep web site.

52
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:28,602
Weapons were being traded.

53
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,854
An AK-47 was being sold
for 1.2 million won.

54
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:32,981
So will you buy it if you have the money?

55
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:37,236
You were discharged from the military
for hardship. What will you do with an AK?

56
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:40,572
You were in operations.
Can you even shoot a gun?

57
00:04:40,656 --> 00:04:42,783
Jeez. What do you even know?

58
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:48,789
Hey, I'm serious.
The quality of the site was different.

59
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:52,167
It was recovered
five minutes after I hacked it.

60
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:54,419
There's something suspicious about it.

61
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:55,754
Come on!

62
00:04:55,838 --> 00:04:58,924
The better the quality,
the higher the chance it's a fake.

63
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,134
What's wrong with you? Are you an amateur?

64
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:04,888
Amateur?

65
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:10,894
Then, what's a pro like?

66
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:16,733
We attend a no-name college.
We're not pros.

67
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,151
We're fucking losers.

68
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,321
These days, there are so many hackers

69
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:23,699
trying to land a sweet job
at a major company.

70
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:25,617
A true black hat hacker in our country?

71
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:27,536
They've all given in.

72
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,414
They pretend to be black,
but they're all white.

73
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:32,207
Wait and see.

74
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,502
I'll show you
what a real black hat hacker is.

75
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:41,758
Hey, forget it. You'll end up in jail.

76
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,970
Are you scared of going to jail?

77
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:47,055
Of course!

78
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:48,557
- I'm so scared!
- Cut it out.

79
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:57,107
Just live the rest of your life
eating meat on a stick.

80
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,736
What's wrong with that?

81
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:02,279
ENTER PASSWORD

82
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:04,781
What was the name of that site?

83
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:07,034
"Murthehelp"?

84
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:09,203
My God.

85
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,626
What the hell? What a jerk.
Who smokes inside these days?

86
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,679
Fuck.

87
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,973
The jerk kept giving us dirty looks.

88
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:31,642
Shall we go down and fight him?

89
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:34,269
Guys like him need a good beating.

90
00:06:34,353 --> 00:06:35,979
I haven't felt this heated in...

91
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:37,064
What's wrong?

92
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,571
Huh?

93
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:49,034
Was it you?

94
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:51,954
Did you hack murthehelp?

95
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:32,703
One minute left.

96
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,943
This is crazy.

97
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:15,954
I did it!

98
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:40,103
Wait. Hold on. I can do it
if you give me a little more time!

99
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:41,688
I'm almost there. I really...

100
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:06,004
By the way...

101
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:10,467
Are you going to get rid of the body?

102
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:22,688
That's when I realized
I was different from ordinary people.

103
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:28,402
I told you to tell me about my uncle.

104
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:31,154
- Is this an autobiography?
- Hmm-mmm.

105
00:09:32,698 --> 00:09:34,908
All of this is connected, you see.

106
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,786
Just be patient and listen.

107
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:41,915
Do you know this man?

108
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,255
What about her?

109
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,039
I'm so sorry.

110
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,918
I wasn't like this
during my military service.

111
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:28,462
I haven't worked out properly
since I was discharged.

112
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:29,713
Sure, rest a little.

113
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:33,008
Okay.

114
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:36,512
I really should work out.

115
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:55,614
Why is it turned?

116
00:10:57,241 --> 00:10:58,325
Shit.

117
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,417
What is this?

118
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:14,758
It's hot as hell in here.

119
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:20,639
Damn it.

120
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:23,350
I want to take a shower so bad. Fuck.

121
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:29,648
What the hell is supposed to be in here?

122
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:30,774
What?

123
00:11:33,569 --> 00:11:35,445
Oh... It's nothing.

124
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:39,575
Drink this.

125
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:41,159
Thank you.

126
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:48,542
How's Jian doing?

127
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:53,380
We were quite close in elementary school.

128
00:12:12,608 --> 00:12:15,194
YOU'VE GOT ONE DAY LEFT

129
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:17,863
God damn it...

130
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:31,376
Boss?
I have to take a dump.

131
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,754
Can I use the bathroom in the house?

132
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:38,050
Thank you.

133
00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:35,649
<i>What are you looking for?</i>

134
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:08,891
Hey.

135
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:10,851
Did I scare you?

136
00:14:11,852 --> 00:14:14,563
When Jian's at home
and I'm in the storage shed,

137
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:16,732
it's a hassle to walk back and forth,

138
00:14:16,815 --> 00:14:18,442
so I had a speaker installed.

139
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:20,027
Oh...

140
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:22,821
I was just taking a look around.

141
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,991
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay. That's no problem.

142
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:28,368
By the way,

143
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:31,246
you major in computer engineering?

144
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:38,378
Yes, computer engineering.

145
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:41,256
That's great.

146
00:14:42,633 --> 00:14:44,927
I think my computer's broken.

147
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:46,637
Can you repair it for me?

148
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:50,599
I'll add the repair fees to your paycheck.

149
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:55,771
Sure.

150
00:15:06,365 --> 00:15:07,908
SCANNING IN PROGRESS...

151
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:09,868
I think it's infected with malware.

152
00:15:09,952 --> 00:15:13,205
I'll format it first and try to save
all the files that I can.

153
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:16,542
Okay. Thanks.

154
00:15:17,543 --> 00:15:21,380
Then, how much should I pay you
for the repairs?

155
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:23,507
That's not necessary.

156
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,592
Jian and I were really close.

157
00:15:26,385 --> 00:15:28,470
- I can do this for free...
- In what grade?

158
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:32,474
Pardon?

159
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:37,771
I've never seen
any of Jian's friends before.

160
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,899
So I was wondering
when you became friends.

161
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:44,695
Well... When we were really young.

162
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:46,113
In the second grade.

163
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,410
She was so rude as a kid
that she had no friends.

164
00:15:55,706 --> 00:15:58,667
You know, Jian couldn't speak
very well back then.

165
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,544
I helped her out quite a lot.

166
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:10,596
And I don't know if you remember,

167
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:12,848
but she was once locked in the school...

168
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:14,641
Yes, that's right.

169
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:17,352
Then, I'll buy you dinner after.

170
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:20,981
I'm going to go clean up.
Come when you're done.

171
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:22,482
Okay.

172
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:23,984
I will.

173
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:43,670
That was easy.

174
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:03,232
It smells like manure. Fuck.

175
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:06,026
Who knew I'd go back to that neighborhood?

176
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:12,407
When will this finish?

177
00:17:22,918 --> 00:17:24,336
ARE YOU DONE YET?

178
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:27,589
Jeong Jinman needs to access it
before I can do anything.

179
00:17:29,258 --> 00:17:31,468
They're such morons.

180
00:17:31,552 --> 00:17:32,636
WAIT A LITTLE LONGER

181
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:40,060
He's on.

182
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:01,456
There you go.

183
00:18:07,462 --> 00:18:08,463
It worked.

184
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:18,891
What is this?

185
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:48,504
GREAT JOB

186
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:27,084
Fuck.

187
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,002
Listen carefully.

188
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:32,673
If you kill me like this,
it'll all be in vain.

189
00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:34,967
That's how I set it up.

190
00:19:49,147 --> 00:19:50,148
Bang.

191
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:04,580
<i>It's me, Lee Yonghan.</i>

192
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:07,708
<i>You've got some balls, kid.</i>

193
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:11,712
I needed my insurance.

194
00:20:13,547 --> 00:20:14,548
If you kill me,

195
00:20:15,007 --> 00:20:16,842
murthehelp will reset,

196
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:18,844
and you won't be able to access it.

197
00:20:19,887 --> 00:20:21,638
I made it so that only I can do it.

198
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,271
<i>Take care of him.</i>

199
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:32,149
Wait! Wait a second.

200
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:33,317
Wait.

201
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:35,444
You saw me in action.

202
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:38,071
I'm good at this.

203
00:20:38,572 --> 00:20:40,407
I'm smart, and I'm good at hacking.

204
00:20:40,866 --> 00:20:42,201
What is it that you want?

205
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:44,411
Jeong Jinman?

206
00:20:44,912 --> 00:20:46,163
Or these weapons?

207
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:48,498
I have...

208
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:53,295
a really sick plan.

209
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:04,932
<i>Let's hear it.</i>

210
00:21:06,934 --> 00:21:09,061
<i>In the end,
it all went according to plan.</i>

211
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:20,531
What?

212
00:21:21,031 --> 00:21:23,367
So embarrassing.
Why does it have to start here?

213
00:22:02,489 --> 00:22:03,490
Huh?

214
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:05,409
What the hell?

215
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:08,871
So that stuttering moron was bluffing.

216
00:22:08,954 --> 00:22:11,582
I thought there'd be something on here.

217
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:15,961
You can't find out the truth of that day
with that.

218
00:22:20,132 --> 00:22:22,176
Aren't you curious, Jian?

219
00:22:23,635 --> 00:22:24,761
Watch closely,

220
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:27,306
how I killed your uncle.

221
00:22:41,987 --> 00:22:43,530
<i>Save me, Uncle.</i>

222
00:22:44,114 --> 00:22:45,949
<i>I don't know where I am right now!</i>

223
00:22:47,534 --> 00:22:49,328
Fuck, let me go!

224
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:52,206
<i>Save me, Uncle.</i>

225
00:22:52,998 --> 00:22:55,000
<i>I don't know where I am right now!</i>

226
00:22:57,502 --> 00:22:59,213
If you kill me,

227
00:22:59,796 --> 00:23:01,340
your niece, Jeong Jian...

228
00:23:01,423 --> 00:23:02,508
<i>Save me, Uncle.</i>

229
00:23:02,591 --> 00:23:05,677
- Babylon will kill her.
<i>- I don't know where I am right now!</i>

230
00:23:05,761 --> 00:23:08,430
Untie me while I'm asking nicely!

231
00:23:10,265 --> 00:23:11,266
Now!

232
00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:14,603
Damn it!

233
00:23:14,686 --> 00:23:15,979
<i>Save me, Uncle.</i>

234
00:23:16,605 --> 00:23:18,774
<i>I don't know where I am right now!</i>

235
00:23:29,368 --> 00:23:30,786
I'll do as you say.

236
00:23:32,955 --> 00:23:35,123
Let Jian go right away as you promised.

237
00:23:35,999 --> 00:23:37,834
Yes, of course.

238
00:23:38,585 --> 00:23:40,712
Trust is so important
in this line of work.

239
00:23:41,588 --> 00:23:43,715
As you know very well. Right?

240
00:23:44,967 --> 00:23:46,218
Untie me now.

241
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:55,602
Pasin.

242
00:23:56,812 --> 00:23:58,355
You don't have to pay me back.

243
00:24:08,782 --> 00:24:10,117
Jeong Jinman!

244
00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:12,244
You have to put me down!

245
00:24:12,786 --> 00:24:14,288
Hey, fucker!

246
00:24:14,955 --> 00:24:16,373
Hey! Shit.

247
00:24:28,886 --> 00:24:29,928
Tell Babylon...

248
00:24:32,014 --> 00:24:34,266
to keep their promise.

249
00:24:36,143 --> 00:24:37,561
Nod if you understand.

250
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,721
Damn it.

251
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,090
A work of art, right?

252
00:27:13,467 --> 00:27:14,927
How did you get my voice?

253
00:27:16,094 --> 00:27:19,223
I've never said that before.

254
00:27:19,723 --> 00:27:21,808
That's a deepfake. It's so common now.

255
00:27:22,976 --> 00:27:26,063
I can make it in less than ten minutes
with your voice clip.

256
00:27:26,563 --> 00:27:30,526
And your convenience store boss helped
with the voice recording.

257
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,361
Watch.

258
00:27:33,445 --> 00:27:36,865
<i>Jeong Jian has shit for brains</i>

259
00:27:38,158 --> 00:27:41,495
<i>Jeong Jian has shit for brains</i>

260
00:27:45,624 --> 00:27:47,292
And your uncle was so...

261
00:27:48,418 --> 00:27:50,462
Jeong Jinman was supposed to be amazing.

262
00:27:51,004 --> 00:27:53,674
But he fell for such a lame trick
and killed himself.

263
00:27:53,757 --> 00:27:55,801
No!

264
00:27:56,969 --> 00:27:57,970
No!

265
00:27:58,887 --> 00:28:00,931
When the almighty Babylon was

266
00:28:02,182 --> 00:28:04,768
being so careful,
I was quite scared to be honest.

267
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,565
But it turned out, it was nothing.

268
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:11,191
It was so lame

269
00:28:12,818 --> 00:28:13,819
and so easy.

270
00:28:15,362 --> 00:28:16,822
But then, it means

271
00:28:17,781 --> 00:28:19,491
I'm that capable, right?

272
00:28:20,534 --> 00:28:23,579
I got something so difficult done
so easily.

273
00:28:25,706 --> 00:28:27,499
Maybe they chose me for a reason.

274
00:29:09,124 --> 00:29:10,125
What is it?

275
00:29:11,126 --> 00:29:13,629
You're just a minion
pretending to be clever.

276
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,131
Are you talking about me?

277
00:29:19,676 --> 00:29:20,677
Babylon?

278
00:29:22,095 --> 00:29:24,932
I doubt they'll keep you alive.

279
00:29:25,015 --> 00:29:27,434
They'll kill you
as soon as you get out of here.

280
00:29:28,185 --> 00:29:30,395
No, wait.

281
00:29:31,188 --> 00:29:35,067
If you kill me,
I bet that woman will kill you first.

282
00:29:35,651 --> 00:29:36,652
Will you be okay?

283
00:29:40,155 --> 00:29:41,156
Hey.

284
00:29:41,657 --> 00:29:44,409
I don't think you're in any position
to piss me off.

285
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,703
Babylon just told me

286
00:29:46,787 --> 00:29:48,205
to kill you.

287
00:29:48,288 --> 00:29:49,331
Hey!

288
00:29:49,915 --> 00:29:50,916
Don't you remember?

289
00:29:52,084 --> 00:29:53,710
You're the one that told me.

290
00:29:54,336 --> 00:29:57,464
"Everyone with a code
has a duty to protect Code Green."

291
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,716
Since my uncle's dead,

292
00:30:00,425 --> 00:30:02,177
I'm the only Code Green left.

293
00:30:06,139 --> 00:30:08,475
I don't know what my uncle has been up to,

294
00:30:10,143 --> 00:30:11,520
but judging by the scale,

295
00:30:12,271 --> 00:30:15,858
I bet there are more people
who will try to protect me.

296
00:30:17,025 --> 00:30:18,652
What the hell are you saying?

297
00:30:18,735 --> 00:30:20,904
Think if you've got a brain.

298
00:30:21,572 --> 00:30:25,492
There's no one from Babylon here.
They don't care if you die.

299
00:30:25,576 --> 00:30:27,953
Didn't you see the drones
that tried to kill us?

300
00:30:28,036 --> 00:30:29,454
You're just

301
00:30:30,455 --> 00:30:32,082
expendable to them.

302
00:30:35,002 --> 00:30:37,921
The only Code Green is me in front of you.

303
00:30:39,214 --> 00:30:40,674
They aren't the ones you need

304
00:30:41,967 --> 00:30:43,302
to make a deal with.

305
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,721
It's me.

306
00:30:46,221 --> 00:30:47,222
Watch it!

307
00:30:49,391 --> 00:30:52,144
You're tied up. Who are you to lecture me?

308
00:30:55,189 --> 00:30:56,190
Also,

309
00:30:58,442 --> 00:31:00,110
why would I make a deal with you?

310
00:31:01,028 --> 00:31:02,571
Jeong Jinman is dead.

311
00:31:03,614 --> 00:31:06,450
Are you trying to act like
murthehelp is yours now?

312
00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:10,329
You didn't even know who your uncle was
just a few hours ago.

313
00:31:12,497 --> 00:31:13,498
Hey.

314
00:31:14,249 --> 00:31:15,250
Look at that.

315
00:31:16,001 --> 00:31:18,754
They can fly their drones,
send in all those old morons,

316
00:31:18,837 --> 00:31:20,172
and shoot all they want.

317
00:31:20,255 --> 00:31:22,090
But I'm the one that made it here

318
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:25,052
and captured you. Me!

319
00:31:27,012 --> 00:31:28,013
Right.

320
00:31:29,348 --> 00:31:32,518
You were wailing and crawling
around our hallway for this?

321
00:31:33,727 --> 00:31:35,521
Thank God you didn't wet yourself.

322
00:31:36,021 --> 00:31:37,940
You only got this far to save yourself

323
00:31:38,023 --> 00:31:40,609
because Babylon had a gun to your head,
you coward!

324
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,738
What are you on about, you mute.

325
00:31:44,821 --> 00:31:46,657
Scared assholes

326
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:49,743
bark like little bitches in groups!

327
00:31:49,826 --> 00:31:52,079
Just like you and the assholes up there!

328
00:32:02,005 --> 00:32:03,423
I dare you to keep talking.

329
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,064
That crazy bitch.

330
00:33:37,768 --> 00:33:38,977
Jian?

331
00:33:41,855 --> 00:33:42,856
Jeong Jian!

332
00:33:43,982 --> 00:33:45,984
You didn't become a mute again, did you?

333
00:33:46,443 --> 00:33:50,155
<i>You need to use everything
around you in times of crisis.</i>

334
00:33:51,156 --> 00:33:53,575
<i>Use whatever means necessary to survive.</i>

335
00:33:54,868 --> 00:33:56,495
<i>I have to do whatever I can.</i>

336
00:34:02,417 --> 00:34:04,169
What the fuck?

337
00:34:04,253 --> 00:34:08,048
I almost killed Jeong Jian so many times.
You don't want me to kill her now?

338
00:34:08,549 --> 00:34:11,260
What if I actually killed her earlier?

339
00:34:11,844 --> 00:34:14,972
Is this the best you can do?

340
00:34:15,556 --> 00:34:16,557
You little...

341
00:34:19,351 --> 00:34:23,188
They want face recognition now?
Are you kidding me?

342
00:34:24,106 --> 00:34:25,107
What?

343
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:51,508
Why are you so late, you punk?

344
00:34:58,182 --> 00:34:59,391
Hello!

345
00:34:59,474 --> 00:35:00,976
Are you late because of that?

346
00:35:01,059 --> 00:35:04,021
I wanted to get this for you,
but there's nothing but mountains.

347
00:35:04,104 --> 00:35:06,648
- It wasn't easy getting it.
- You little punk.

348
00:35:08,734 --> 00:35:10,194
Don't hate me too much.

349
00:35:12,112 --> 00:35:14,573
Your uncle wasn't that great
of a person either.

350
00:35:15,699 --> 00:35:16,825
Jeong Jinman

351
00:35:17,409 --> 00:35:19,161
probably killed a lot of people.

352
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:26,460
And Jian.

353
00:35:28,045 --> 00:35:29,671
This world we're living in...

354
00:35:31,006 --> 00:35:34,009
It's not about being good or bad.

355
00:35:34,092 --> 00:35:36,428
It's about being strong or weak.

356
00:35:38,555 --> 00:35:41,308
And Jeong Jinman, who was
at the top of the food chain,

357
00:35:42,059 --> 00:35:44,520
died from the trap I set.

358
00:35:49,358 --> 00:35:50,442
That means

359
00:35:51,902 --> 00:35:53,529
I'm stronger than Jeong Jinman.

360
00:35:56,782 --> 00:35:58,742
Do you think you can run away from...

361
00:36:07,292 --> 00:36:09,795
Fuck! Seriously?

362
00:36:10,587 --> 00:36:12,047
Jian.

363
00:36:12,589 --> 00:36:14,132
Fuck!

364
00:36:14,216 --> 00:36:15,551
Jeong Jian!

365
00:36:17,553 --> 00:36:18,679
Please!

366
00:36:20,055 --> 00:36:21,765
Jian.

367
00:36:22,474 --> 00:36:23,725
Jian!

368
00:36:32,276 --> 00:36:33,902
Jian... Jian, wait.

369
00:36:34,403 --> 00:36:36,697
You can't compare to my uncle at all.

370
00:36:48,333 --> 00:36:51,420
Jian... Jian.

371
00:36:55,299 --> 00:36:57,134
You have to think this through.

372
00:36:57,718 --> 00:36:59,928
You should take my side.

373
00:37:01,972 --> 00:37:05,392
If the strong fight the strong,
they break like your uncle.

374
00:37:06,643 --> 00:37:07,769
The weak

375
00:37:08,687 --> 00:37:11,440
must know their place and choose wisely.

376
00:37:12,566 --> 00:37:13,984
You dummy.

377
00:37:18,363 --> 00:37:19,448
Yeah, right.

378
00:37:34,505 --> 00:37:37,674
Still, how could you leave
Jian there alone?

379
00:37:37,758 --> 00:37:40,427
She needs to solve
all the problems by herself.

380
00:37:40,511 --> 00:37:43,805
That's how she'll learn to survive.

381
00:37:43,889 --> 00:37:45,224
It's what the boss wanted.

382
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,101
Don't worry.

383
00:37:48,185 --> 00:37:51,021
Jeong Jian isn't weak at all.

384
00:38:01,031 --> 00:38:02,783
They'll start to attack again.

385
00:38:04,284 --> 00:38:05,827
Is this all you brought?

386
00:38:07,871 --> 00:38:09,248
Only 12 bullets?

387
00:38:11,333 --> 00:38:14,211
After what happened with Bale,
the boss said

388
00:38:14,294 --> 00:38:17,130
an attack like this
could happen at any time.

389
00:38:17,214 --> 00:38:20,092
Also, in order to defend ourselves
at any given time,

390
00:38:21,635 --> 00:38:22,803
he remodeled the house.

391
00:38:24,096 --> 00:38:25,097
So...

392
00:38:31,687 --> 00:38:32,688
What are you doing?

393
00:39:02,968 --> 00:39:05,095
It's so refreshing.

394
00:39:05,179 --> 00:39:08,015
This hits the spot during times like this!

395
00:39:08,098 --> 00:39:09,975
But you didn't have to get this for me.

396
00:39:10,058 --> 00:39:13,770
I've been craving sweet things lately
for some reason.

397
00:39:14,313 --> 00:39:15,480
Have you saved up?

398
00:39:16,315 --> 00:39:18,859
Working at a company
fucking sucks these days.

399
00:39:19,985 --> 00:39:22,696
So I'm thinking of
starting my own business

400
00:39:23,197 --> 00:39:24,615
like you.

401
00:39:26,158 --> 00:39:29,578
You know, they say that
the office is a battlefield,

402
00:39:29,661 --> 00:39:31,580
but outside is hell.

403
00:39:31,663 --> 00:39:33,999
I can relate to that completely.

404
00:39:34,082 --> 00:39:35,834
Fuck, since I'm on my own now,

405
00:39:35,918 --> 00:39:38,545
I have to pay for every bullet
with my own money.

406
00:39:38,629 --> 00:39:40,047
It's fucking awful.

407
00:39:41,215 --> 00:39:44,259
While you belong to Babylon,
nothing you do is illegal.

408
00:39:44,343 --> 00:39:45,344
That's true.

409
00:39:45,427 --> 00:39:47,179
Stay there for as long as you can.

410
00:39:47,262 --> 00:39:51,099
You're right. I should.
I had the wrong idea. Damn it.

411
00:39:51,183 --> 00:39:52,184
Crap.

412
00:39:52,935 --> 00:39:54,353
By the way,

413
00:39:54,436 --> 00:39:57,606
it seems Mr. Kim's dead.
I think Minhye got him.

414
00:39:58,232 --> 00:40:00,150
That wretched bitch.

415
00:40:02,194 --> 00:40:03,195
Damn.

416
00:40:03,278 --> 00:40:06,615
You tuned your ride. Does it run well?

417
00:40:06,698 --> 00:40:09,326
Well, I bought it used.

418
00:40:09,409 --> 00:40:12,037
It drives so well.
And it's nice and rugged.

419
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:15,499
PERFECT WASH

420
00:40:17,376 --> 00:40:19,545
DO NOT ENTER

421
00:40:22,214 --> 00:40:23,966
They're here.

422
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:28,011
"Bubble Car Wash..."

423
00:40:28,804 --> 00:40:32,057
That looks so cheap.
Why does it have to be a car wash?

424
00:40:33,308 --> 00:40:35,310
Wow.

425
00:40:36,144 --> 00:40:38,021
Are you sleeping?

426
00:40:38,605 --> 00:40:40,190
It's smaller than I thought.

427
00:40:42,109 --> 00:40:43,110
Whoa!

428
00:40:53,495 --> 00:40:55,414
Is it warming up or something?

429
00:41:00,752 --> 00:41:02,337
These things are a problem.

430
00:41:03,046 --> 00:41:04,673
You shouldn't approve of these things.

431
00:41:04,756 --> 00:41:07,968
They're going to steal our jobs later.

432
00:41:08,051 --> 00:41:12,264
It's not as great as I thought.
It's kind of lame. Don't you think?

433
00:41:24,985 --> 00:41:26,153
I'll start the attack.

434
00:41:50,594 --> 00:41:54,806
Damn, I think it can steal our jobs
right this minute.

435
00:41:55,474 --> 00:41:57,392
What are you all doing? Get to it.

436
00:41:59,686 --> 00:42:02,523
All right. Group 2, can you hear me?

437
00:42:03,232 --> 00:42:06,276
Don't kill Jeong Jian. Capture her alive.

438
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:10,656
It's fine if you break
an arm or a leg, though.

439
00:42:11,281 --> 00:42:12,282
All right.

440
00:42:12,366 --> 00:42:13,450
Beware of Minhye.

441
00:42:13,992 --> 00:42:15,452
I'll see you all alive!

442
00:42:30,801 --> 00:42:32,010
On the surface,

443
00:42:32,094 --> 00:42:34,596
it may look like an ordinary house,

444
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,974
but each space can be used for defense.

445
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:38,851
If we use this well,

446
00:42:38,934 --> 00:42:42,604
no one will be able to enter.

447
00:42:55,117 --> 00:42:56,118
What's that?

448
00:42:58,996 --> 00:43:00,122
<i>Kuma.</i>

449
00:43:00,205 --> 00:43:01,206
Hurry up.

450
00:43:06,086 --> 00:43:07,337
Run! Enter the house!

451
00:43:16,096 --> 00:43:19,516
Unless we're hit by a missile,
we're going to survive.

452
00:43:24,354 --> 00:43:25,355
Darn it.

453
00:43:26,565 --> 00:43:28,233
Then, how will you stop that?

454
00:43:28,317 --> 00:43:29,318
What?

455
00:43:42,497 --> 00:43:44,625
Come inside, Minhye!

456
00:44:26,166 --> 00:44:27,167
Wow.

457
00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:31,213
We'll be able to get inside at least,
thanks to you.

458
00:44:31,296 --> 00:44:32,297
Great job.

459
00:44:34,675 --> 00:44:35,676
<i>Go in or not?</i>

460
00:44:36,885 --> 00:44:38,971
<i>For fuck's sake, can we go inside or not?</i>

461
00:44:40,138 --> 00:44:41,139
Go inside.

462
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:44,518
Why the hell did he have to cuss?

463
00:44:48,856 --> 00:44:50,858
What the hell kind of shutter is this?

464
00:44:51,608 --> 00:44:52,609
Hold on.

465
00:44:53,402 --> 00:44:54,903
How did you get in here?

466
00:45:16,508 --> 00:45:17,509
What the hell?

467
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,887
Shit, are we trapped?

468
00:45:20,429 --> 00:45:21,805
Don't worry.

469
00:45:21,889 --> 00:45:23,307
Hey, don't be scared.

470
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:24,516
Don't be scared.

471
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:28,437
Shit, when did Jeong Jinman prepare
something like that?

472
00:45:29,688 --> 00:45:30,689
Of course.

473
00:45:31,231 --> 00:45:34,318
You would never
make things easy for us. Right?

474
00:45:34,818 --> 00:45:36,153
Motherfucker.

475
00:45:39,031 --> 00:45:40,657
Do something about that.

476
00:45:41,116 --> 00:45:43,035
Are you just going to do nothing?

477
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:45,913
Damn it.

478
00:45:47,915 --> 00:45:48,916
What's that?

479
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:52,920
They're hiding in there.

480
00:46:01,512 --> 00:46:03,263
Jinman wouldn't have called me here

481
00:46:03,847 --> 00:46:05,891
if they could be stopped this easily.

482
00:46:11,522 --> 00:46:13,732
From here on, you're on your own.

483
00:46:15,108 --> 00:46:16,109
Don't die.

484
00:46:45,055 --> 00:46:47,099
What do you want me to do?

485
00:46:51,645 --> 00:46:55,399
MURTHEHELP
HANDOVER GUIDE

486
00:47:03,657 --> 00:47:06,451
<i>Jian, I'm sure you're confused.</i>

487
00:47:07,411 --> 00:47:08,871
<i>But there's no time,</i>

488
00:47:08,954 --> 00:47:10,581
<i>so I'll give you a chance to choose.</i>

489
00:47:11,707 --> 00:47:12,708
<i>One,</i>

490
00:47:13,208 --> 00:47:15,377
<i>if you want to run away
from this situation,</i>

491
00:47:15,836 --> 00:47:17,254
<i>go to page 87.</i>

492
00:47:17,796 --> 00:47:21,884
<i>Use the back door of murthehelp

493
00:47:21,967 --> 00:47:23,343
<i>At the end of the route</i>

494
00:47:23,427 --> 00:47:27,055
<i>are your new identity,
enough money for your new life,</i>

495
00:47:27,681 --> 00:47:32,644
<i>and the phone number of the person
who will help you completely start over.</i>

496
00:47:35,981 --> 00:47:37,608
<i>You'll have a new identity.</i>

497
00:47:38,275 --> 00:47:41,904
<i>You'll be able to forget everything
about this life and start over.</i>

498
00:47:43,322 --> 00:47:44,323
<i>Two,</i>

499
00:47:44,406 --> 00:47:47,576
<i>if you want to join the people
who are fighting for you</i>

500
00:47:48,076 --> 00:47:50,954
<i>or those who will fight alongside you</i>

501
00:47:52,289 --> 00:47:55,500
<i>to overcome these difficulties
and protect this place,</i>

502
00:47:56,168 --> 00:47:58,712
<i>turn the page

503
00:47:59,338 --> 00:48:02,132
<i>I'm sorry I let you fall
into this whirlwind,</i>

504
00:48:03,133 --> 00:48:07,095
<i>but the choice is yours, Jian.</i>

505
00:48:07,638 --> 00:48:09,181
Damn it...

506
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:27,908
Hey, it's gas! Gas!

507
00:48:28,033 --> 00:48:30,077
- It's gas! Gas!
- Gas!

508
00:48:39,253 --> 00:48:40,921
This is suicide.

509
00:49:17,916 --> 00:49:18,917
Now!

510
00:49:28,177 --> 00:49:29,428
Guys, stay alert.

511
00:50:51,802 --> 00:50:54,054
Minhye! Over here!

512
00:51:57,910 --> 00:51:59,161
Oh, fuck.

513
00:52:03,498 --> 00:52:04,958
What the hell?

514
00:52:06,168 --> 00:52:07,252
What was that?

515
00:52:07,794 --> 00:52:08,837
What exploded?

516
00:52:39,826 --> 00:52:41,036
Are you okay?

517
00:52:41,828 --> 00:52:43,188
Do you have more clothes?

518
00:52:53,882 --> 00:52:54,925
Minhye!

519
00:52:55,008 --> 00:52:57,094
- Minhye!
- So you're Jeong Jian.

520
00:52:58,971 --> 00:53:00,055
Let me go!

521
00:53:00,138 --> 00:53:02,266
Let go!

522
00:53:02,349 --> 00:53:03,350
Hey!

523
00:53:07,437 --> 00:53:08,981
What now?

524
00:53:30,794 --> 00:53:33,046
You really do take after your uncle.

525
00:53:46,393 --> 00:53:48,729
Damn it. Look what you did
to my handsome face.

526
00:53:50,522 --> 00:53:52,316
<i>Kuma, what happened?</i>

527
00:53:54,234 --> 00:53:55,944
<i>Did you get Jeong Jian and Minhye?</i>

528
00:53:56,028 --> 00:53:57,654
Yes, I got them, but...

529
00:53:59,156 --> 00:54:01,074
Fuck, I'm the only one who survived.

530
00:54:02,451 --> 00:54:04,620
<i>Hey,
you can't kill Jeong Jian yet.</i>

531
00:54:06,413 --> 00:54:07,623
Okay, I won't kill her.

532
00:54:08,957 --> 00:54:11,543
I'll just cut off half of her face.

533
00:54:11,627 --> 00:54:13,170
<i>She needs to be recognizable.</i>

534
00:54:53,126 --> 00:54:54,127
Master?

535
00:55:20,988 --> 00:55:22,281
There's no time.

536
00:55:24,950 --> 00:55:25,951
Let's get ready.

537
00:55:27,369 --> 00:55:28,370
Bale's coming.

538
00:55:30,247 --> 00:55:31,248
"Bale"?

539
00:55:33,709 --> 00:55:35,335
The one who killed your parents.

540
00:55:40,007 --> 00:55:44,761
A SHOP FOR KILLERS

541
00:55:49,766 --> 00:55:50,767
What was that?

542
00:55:52,352 --> 00:55:53,353
A slingshot?

543
00:56:04,531 --> 00:56:05,574
It looks like

544
00:56:07,367 --> 00:56:08,744
you two should handle it.
