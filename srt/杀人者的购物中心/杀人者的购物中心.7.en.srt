- Salute!

367
00:48:33,207 --> 00:48:34,625
Salute!

368
00:48:34,709 --> 00:48:39,297
- Happy birthday, Grandpa!
- Thank you so much, my boy.

369
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:42,008
- Dad, why are you so late?
- Sorry, something came up at work.

370
00:48:42,091 --> 00:48:43,175
- Grandpa!
- Yes?

371
00:48:43,259 --> 00:48:44,635
- Take a look at this.
- Okay.

372
00:48:44,719 --> 00:48:46,888
The man made this for me.

373
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:49,181
Shall we go in?

374
00:48:49,891 --> 00:48:51,017
Let's go.

375
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:52,143
Let's go.

376
00:48:52,643 --> 00:48:55,479
KID: Mister, can you make a car too?

377
00:48:55,563 --> 00:48:58,274
WOMAN 1: Jungwoo, put away your toys,
and wash your hands.

378
00:48:58,357 --> 00:49:00,610
WOMAN 2: He gets so excited
when we have guests.

379
00:49:05,323 --> 00:49:07,658
WOMAN 1: Stop bothering him. Come on.

380
00:49:10,536 --> 00:49:11,746
WOMAN 2: Is it done yet?

381
00:49:11,829 --> 00:49:13,956
WOMAN 1: Yes, Mother. Can you taste this?

382
00:49:16,417 --> 00:49:18,878
WOMAN 2: It's perfect.
Simmer it a little longer.

383
00:49:20,755 --> 00:49:22,298
Do you want to try this?

384
00:49:23,966 --> 00:49:27,511
You should've told us
we were going to have a guest over.

385
00:49:27,595 --> 00:49:28,721
Sorry.

386
00:49:28,804 --> 00:49:30,181
I forgot I invited him.

387
00:49:30,264 --> 00:49:33,142
- Did you all say hello?
- Yes.

388
00:49:33,226 --> 00:49:35,102
Dinner's ready. Come and sit.

389
00:49:35,186 --> 00:49:36,479
Thank you so much, ma'am.

390
00:49:36,562 --> 00:49:38,439
It's not much, though.

391
00:49:38,522 --> 00:49:40,233
It's more than I could hope for.

392
00:49:41,817 --> 00:49:42,860
MAN: Let's go eat.

393
00:49:53,454 --> 00:49:54,497
What are you doing?

394
00:49:57,333 --> 00:49:59,335
There are five rounds left in the mag.

395
00:50:00,836 --> 00:50:01,837
Your grandson,

396
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:04,423
son, daughter-in-law, and wife...

397
00:50:05,883 --> 00:50:08,553
I'll have one left
after I kill those four.

398
00:50:10,888 --> 00:50:13,808
I was in the house for an hour
before you got here,

399
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:15,851
but I didn't do it.

400
00:50:20,314 --> 00:50:21,691
What do you want?

401
00:50:26,112 --> 00:50:28,406
I know you're a calculative man,

402
00:50:29,323 --> 00:50:31,075
so I'll put it simply.

403
00:50:35,871 --> 00:50:36,998
My mother,

404
00:50:41,961 --> 00:50:43,296
brother, sister-in-law,

405
00:50:45,047 --> 00:50:47,717
and my comrade and friend.

406
00:50:49,176 --> 00:50:51,012
I lost four people

407
00:50:51,095 --> 00:50:52,680
of mine.

408
00:50:55,683 --> 00:50:56,809
Don't you think

409
00:50:57,310 --> 00:51:00,229
that's enough punishment for what I did?

410
00:51:02,732 --> 00:51:04,108
If you stop here,

411
00:51:05,484 --> 00:51:07,320
I'll bury everything that's happened

412
00:51:08,112 --> 00:51:10,448
and take it to my grave.

413
00:51:18,331 --> 00:51:20,374
Please, General.

414
00:51:32,011 --> 00:51:33,012
It's me.

415
00:51:33,721 --> 00:51:35,681
Jinman says he'll stop here.

416
00:51:37,433 --> 00:51:38,976
Do you think you can?

417
00:51:59,163 --> 00:52:00,164
(LAUGHS)

418
00:52:06,712 --> 00:52:08,381
PASIN: Do you think Babylon will stop?

419
00:52:14,053 --> 00:52:16,055
Babylon might back down,

420
00:52:18,015 --> 00:52:19,850
but Bale won't.

421
00:52:24,814 --> 00:52:26,482
Are you going to make the first move?

422
00:52:30,987 --> 00:52:32,280
I could,

423
00:52:33,489 --> 00:52:34,782
but not right now.

424
00:52:35,658 --> 00:52:37,451
I need a long-term plan.

425
00:52:54,427 --> 00:52:57,471
You'll make a shopping mall down there?

426
00:53:01,601 --> 00:53:03,811
You're a crazy bastard, Jinman.

427
00:53:10,151 --> 00:53:11,527
You do the digging.

428
00:53:12,445 --> 00:53:13,446
JINMAN: Okay.

429
00:53:39,472 --> 00:53:40,556
Let's go, Brother.

430
00:53:41,265 --> 00:53:43,517
You're going to live with me now.

431
00:53:46,354 --> 00:53:49,523
- Great job, boss. See you tomorrow.
- Yes, see you tomorrow.

432
00:53:53,152 --> 00:53:55,363
You shouldn't walk alone late at night.

433
00:53:55,446 --> 00:53:56,906
Want to have a drink with us?

434
00:54:19,595 --> 00:54:20,763
(SPEAKS MANDARIN) Who are you?

435
00:54:20,846 --> 00:54:22,306
What are you trying to do?

436
00:54:24,684 --> 00:54:27,186
(SPEAKS KOREAN) Oh, you're quite good.

437
00:54:35,236 --> 00:54:36,529
Is this Honda's?

438
00:54:51,127 --> 00:54:52,128
Get out.

439
00:56:18,881 --> 00:56:20,383
(GASPS)

440
00:57:02,633 --> 00:57:03,634
(GUNSHOT)

441
00:57:10,975 --> 00:57:13,227
A gun? Where did you get that?

442
00:57:14,228 --> 00:57:15,479
Do you want to try it?

443
00:57:33,915 --> 00:57:35,249
Listen up, Jian.

444
00:57:35,958 --> 00:57:40,713
A SHOP FOR KILLERS

445
00:57:40,796 --> 00:57:43,799
(POP SONG PLAYING)
