1
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:05,880
Hold on.

2
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:07,757
Let me take a look.

3
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:16,266
Jian, are you back from school?

4
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:18,810
JIAN
17 YEARS OLD

5
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:28,445
The house is perfectly fine.
Why are you breaking it down?

6
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:30,989
This house is not perfectly fine.

7
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:32,198
On the surface,

8
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:34,951
yes, it looks fine. Nice and strong.

9
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,037
But it's not strong at all.

10
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:38,580
Especially this room.

11
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:40,290
The roof might fall any second.

12
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:44,544
That's why repair work needs to be done
as soon as possible.

13
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:46,546
Stay somewhere else for two weeks.

14
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:48,631
It will be strong after we repair it.

15
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:51,426
Okay, whatever.

16
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:52,927
Fine.

17
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,054
Okay!

18
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:57,932
In that case, add a window to my room
while you're at it.

19
00:00:58,016 --> 00:00:59,642
What room doesn't have a window?

20
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:00,810
Window?

21
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:01,936
A window.

22
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,438
That'll cost more.

23
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:04,647
Up the price.

24
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,066
Korean beef?

25
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:08,193
- Okay, I like Korean beef.
- Let's eat that.

26
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:09,360
Okay.

27
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:16,367
You have to pay triple for the window.

28
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:22,457
I'm sorry, how much?

29
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,126
He's angry.

30
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:27,629
Pork belly, then.

31
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:29,380
Let's eat pork belly.

32
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:31,216
Just double, then.

33
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:35,804
All right, fine.

34
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:37,305
Nice.

35
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:38,723
Thank you, sir.

36
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,517
Thank you, sir.

37
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,976
See you later, sir!

38
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,561
We'll see you in two weeks.

39
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:44,729
Thank you, sir.

40
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,150
Where do we stay for two weeks?

41
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:54,697
Jirisan Mountain.

42
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:56,449
What?

43
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,299
There's... a cave.

44
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:15,885
Why is there a cave here?

45
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,346
What a relief.

46
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:19,430
That's true.

47
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:21,683
Be careful.

48
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:30,984
NO SIGNAL

49
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:37,657
NO SIGNAL

50
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:38,992
Darn it.

51
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:55,925
You're too...

52
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:59,262
You're way too hot!

53
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:03,600
Once the high fever subsides,

54
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:06,936
hypothermia will set in.

55
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:09,898
Damn...

56
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:14,068
I can't believe I'll get hypothermia
in the mountains at night.

57
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:17,572
This is ridiculous.

58
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,324
Exactly.

59
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:23,036
We should've gone to a hotel or a motel.

60
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:25,330
Or some nice and quiet campsite.

61
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:27,123
Why explore this mountain?

62
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,374
You even hurt your leg!

63
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:31,294
That's my hurt leg.

64
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,762
Listen up, Jian.

65
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,556
When you're in a difficult situation,

66
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,309
instead of arguing over right and wrong,

67
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,103
it's important to find a way

68
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:51,231
to solve the problem

69
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:53,608
and overcome the situation.

70
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,235
Okay?

71
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,238
What the heck?

72
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,031
Are you lecturing me now?

73
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,494
We don't even know where we are.

74
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:11,709
What's that?

75
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:14,712
You had a map?

76
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:15,964
I think

77
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:17,882
-this is where we are.
-Okay.

78
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:22,220
So if you walk
five or six kilometers this way,

79
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:24,847
there will be a shelter
with an emergency phone.

80
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:27,684
Can you

81
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,727
get there on your own?

82
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,069
I have to.

83
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,990
You'll become one with Mother Nature
if I don't.

84
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:43,241
Right.

85
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:44,575
I love nature.

86
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,661
That wouldn't be so bad.

87
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:48,413
It sounds good to me too.

88
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:49,872
I'll get to live on my own.

89
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,711
Right, Jian. Hold on.

90
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:58,131
Just in case,

91
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,049
take this with you.

92
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:04,637
What's so funny?

93
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:08,224
Do you know how many wild boars
are in this mountain?

94
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,892
What if you run into one?

95
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:11,769
Wild boars are scary.

96
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,605
If they're hungry and have nothing to eat,

97
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,316
they try to eat humans too.

98
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:18,067
What are you doing?

99
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:20,528
Are you trying to scare your rescuer?

100
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:22,113
Are you scared?

101
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:23,906
Of course not!

102
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:27,785
I should run away if I meet a boar.
How will this help?

103
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,665
If you think you're in danger,

104
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:34,250
shout out my name

105
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,836
at the sky three times.

106
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,589
"Jeong Jinman,
Jeong Jinman, Jeong Jinman!"

107
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,175
Then...

108
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:44,802
I might just show up.

109
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:48,890
What a load of bull.

110
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:52,810
Uncle.

111
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:54,854
I clearly saw you sweat a lot.

112
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:56,564
Are you sure you're sick?

113
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,777
I'm burning up!

114
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:03,404
Come on.

115
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:06,407
Don't you remember when you were little?

116
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,160
When the bullies at school locked you up,

117
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:11,412
you shouted my name

118
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,706
and I magically appeared.

119
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:17,460
No, I don't remember.

120
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:23,049
Anyway,

121
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:25,093
leave this if you don't need it.

122
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,177
Wait!

123
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,235
Wait here.

124
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,695
I'll call for help and be right back.

125
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,158
Be careful, okay?

126
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,243
Okay!

127
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:10,596
Hey.

128
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:13,391
Pasin, it's me.

129
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:18,229
The drugs are incredible.

130
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:24,986
Yes.

131
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:26,988
Jian is on her way down.

132
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:30,992
Okay.

133
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:34,745
We should let her decide herself.

134
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:05,985
Is this the right path?

135
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,383
I found it.

136
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:09,317
<i>Only the weak bark.</i>

137
00:10:13,878 --> 00:10:15,213
The strong don't.

138
00:10:19,008 --> 00:10:20,218
You must become strong.

139
00:10:21,511 --> 00:10:25,056
<i>Whatever makes you scared,</i>
<i>keep your eyes open and face it.</i>

140
00:11:12,854 --> 00:11:15,356
You were sweating with a fever.

141
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,441
What's going on?

142
00:11:17,317 --> 00:11:19,027
I didn't have to climb down alone.

143
00:11:21,988 --> 00:11:24,032
Nature must've healed me quickly.

144
00:11:24,574 --> 00:11:26,618
I think nature fits me well.

145
00:11:28,411 --> 00:11:29,412
And your leg?

146
00:11:30,997 --> 00:11:32,582
It still hurts.

147
00:11:33,374 --> 00:11:35,168
You saw me limping earlier.

148
00:11:40,882 --> 00:11:43,927
And where on earth
did you get that kind of gun?

149
00:11:45,845 --> 00:11:47,263
It was in the backpack.

150
00:11:47,347 --> 00:11:48,431
Pasin lent it to me.

151
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,686
Why does he have a gun to begin with?

152
00:11:57,482 --> 00:11:58,483
Wait.

153
00:12:00,568 --> 00:12:03,404
So you had a real gun,

154
00:12:05,448 --> 00:12:07,534
but you gave me a slingshot?

155
00:12:10,245 --> 00:12:13,081
What kind of uncle are you?

156
00:12:13,164 --> 00:12:16,543
That's because you don't know
how to use a gun.

157
00:13:26,362 --> 00:13:27,363
A gun?

158
00:13:27,906 --> 00:13:29,240
Where did you get that?

159
00:13:30,074 --> 00:13:31,409
Isn't it illegal?

160
00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:36,372
Do you want to try it?

161
00:13:45,423 --> 00:13:46,591
Listen up, Jian.

162
00:13:47,634 --> 00:13:50,386
Guns are double-edged swords.

163
00:13:52,055 --> 00:13:53,056
With this gun,

164
00:13:54,015 --> 00:13:56,017
you can protect yourself,

165
00:13:57,143 --> 00:13:59,062
and you can save your companions.

166
00:14:01,022 --> 00:14:02,941
But someone always gets killed by it.

167
00:14:03,566 --> 00:14:04,651
Keep that in mind.

168
00:14:07,445 --> 00:14:08,529
This is the magazine.

169
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,239
This is the barrel.

170
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,200
This is the slide.

171
00:14:12,784 --> 00:14:13,868
Inside is the bolt.

172
00:14:13,952 --> 00:14:15,078
Okay.

173
00:14:15,161 --> 00:14:17,497
That's the recoil spring,
and that's the frame.

174
00:14:34,764 --> 00:14:35,765
Align your sights.

175
00:14:36,307 --> 00:14:37,308
Take a deep breath.

176
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:44,816
A SHOP FOR KILLERS

177
00:14:47,944 --> 00:14:49,988
EPISODE 3
THE STRONG DON'T HOWL

178
00:15:04,168 --> 00:15:05,169
Are you okay?

179
00:15:07,922 --> 00:15:10,216
Jeongmin, snap out of it!

180
00:15:10,299 --> 00:15:11,676
Do you want to die here?

181
00:16:03,186 --> 00:16:04,187
Shit.

182
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,772
They've pulled out all the stops.

183
00:17:35,027 --> 00:17:36,696
This... isn't right.

184
00:17:39,323 --> 00:17:40,408
We have to get out.

185
00:17:46,247 --> 00:17:47,373
Jeongmin.

186
00:18:03,014 --> 00:18:04,015
Who are you?

187
00:18:05,266 --> 00:18:08,769
Bae Jeongmin. I... I'm Jian's friend.

188
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,488
What did you just...

189
00:18:38,507 --> 00:18:39,508
Was it you

190
00:18:40,009 --> 00:18:41,344
that tried to kill us?

191
00:18:42,511 --> 00:18:43,512
What's that?

192
00:18:44,931 --> 00:18:45,932
A slingshot?

193
00:18:58,361 --> 00:18:59,737
Let go of me!

194
00:19:00,238 --> 00:19:02,365
Let go! Let go of me!

195
00:19:02,949 --> 00:19:03,950
Let go!

196
00:19:06,244 --> 00:19:09,455
You move without thinking.
You're the opposite of your uncle.

197
00:19:10,122 --> 00:19:13,125
But you better think and move
like your uncle from now on.

198
00:19:13,751 --> 00:19:15,169
If you want to survive.

199
00:19:50,413 --> 00:19:51,914
What the hell's going on?

200
00:19:52,498 --> 00:19:54,125
Is someone with her?

201
00:19:54,792 --> 00:19:58,254
Shit. I could've taken her out
with my first shot.

202
00:19:58,337 --> 00:19:59,672
Come on, Seongjo.

203
00:19:59,755 --> 00:20:02,883
If you did that, what's the point
of having all the guys here?

204
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,263
Right?

205
00:20:07,346 --> 00:20:09,640
-I should give them a chance too.
-Of course.

206
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,727
Have this and keep it up.

207
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:15,187
Let's get something nice to eat
when we're done.

208
00:20:30,218 --> 00:20:31,845
I'm not here to fight you.

209
00:20:32,345 --> 00:20:33,555
I'm here to protect you.

210
00:20:34,222 --> 00:20:35,223
Who are you?

211
00:20:35,807 --> 00:20:37,642
What did you do to Jeongmin?

212
00:20:39,144 --> 00:20:40,520
Don't worry. He's not dead.

213
00:20:43,231 --> 00:20:44,399
Think about it, Jian.

214
00:20:44,983 --> 00:20:46,443
Didn't you find it strange?

215
00:20:47,152 --> 00:20:49,612
"Shout 'Jeong Jinman'
at the sky three times."

216
00:20:54,117 --> 00:20:57,495
You've done it just three times
in the last ten years.

217
00:20:58,329 --> 00:21:01,124
When you were bullied by a girl
in middle school,

218
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:03,334
when you were sexually harassed,

219
00:21:03,835 --> 00:21:04,961
and this year.

220
00:21:05,044 --> 00:21:08,089
Your boss at the convenience store
that tried to stiff you.

221
00:21:08,173 --> 00:21:09,883
What happened to them all?

222
00:21:13,595 --> 00:21:14,679
You probably don't know,

223
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,390
but there's a code implanted
in your forearm.

224
00:21:18,141 --> 00:21:20,560
You and your uncle
are the only two green codes.

225
00:21:22,228 --> 00:21:26,483
Whoever received a code has a duty
to protect you, Jeong Jian.

226
00:21:28,067 --> 00:21:30,945
That's why everyone was mobilized
when you shouted his name.

227
00:21:32,197 --> 00:21:34,240
That girl in your class was transferred.

228
00:21:34,866 --> 00:21:37,243
The pervert from college dropped out.

229
00:21:37,911 --> 00:21:39,996
And your boss had an accident, right?

230
00:21:40,872 --> 00:21:41,956
Darn it.

231
00:21:42,457 --> 00:21:44,000
What on earth...

232
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:45,668
What the hell are you saying?

233
00:21:45,752 --> 00:21:47,045
You saw just now,

234
00:21:47,128 --> 00:21:49,005
the drones trying to kill you.

235
00:21:50,673 --> 00:21:52,342
<i>I repeat.</i>

236
00:21:52,425 --> 00:21:56,888
<i>Please evacuate to a safe location</i>
<i>as soon as possible.</i>

237
00:21:57,597 --> 00:21:59,974
<i>Let me repeat myself once more.</i>

238
00:22:00,767 --> 00:22:02,936
<i>Until 18:00 hours today,</i>

239
00:22:03,019 --> 00:22:06,356
<i>live firearm training</i>
<i>will be conducted on base.</i>

240
00:22:06,689 --> 00:22:09,817
<i>- It will cause some dust and...</i>
- Even the military is helping.

241
00:22:09,901 --> 00:22:11,819
Seongjo must've pulled some strings.

242
00:22:14,656 --> 00:22:16,658
All right, let's go if you're ready.

243
00:22:18,076 --> 00:22:21,204
Mr. Kim, it's a house with one girl.

244
00:22:21,287 --> 00:22:22,830
Isn't this overkill?

245
00:22:22,914 --> 00:22:26,501
I know she's Jeong Jinman's niece,
but she's just a 21-year-old kid.

246
00:22:27,252 --> 00:22:28,253
Right.

247
00:22:28,962 --> 00:22:31,172
I hope you're right.

248
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:32,840
But I don't know.

249
00:22:34,842 --> 00:22:36,427
Team members.

250
00:22:36,511 --> 00:22:38,805
Follow my instructions from now on.

251
00:22:40,098 --> 00:22:41,099
In an emergency,

252
00:22:41,933 --> 00:22:45,270
if you decide to break away and die
from your own judgement,

253
00:22:46,187 --> 00:22:50,024
you'll be departing this life
for chump change

254
00:22:51,317 --> 00:22:54,404
with no insurance and no one to blame.

255
00:22:54,487 --> 00:22:57,282
So keep that in mind and try to keep up.

256
00:22:57,365 --> 00:22:58,700
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

257
00:23:01,703 --> 00:23:04,289
One, two. Testing. Mic test.

258
00:23:04,372 --> 00:23:06,332
<i>Seongjo, can you hear me?</i>

259
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:09,669
Yes, loud and clear.

260
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,860
Don't move and stay there!

261
00:23:50,335 --> 00:23:51,669
What the hell?

262
00:23:51,753 --> 00:23:53,212
How could that be there?

263
00:23:57,467 --> 00:23:58,593
Jeez...

264
00:24:07,977 --> 00:24:09,312
Hey, it's me.

265
00:24:09,854 --> 00:24:11,648
I think someone's helping the kid.

266
00:24:14,567 --> 00:24:16,569
Damn it, there's too much smoke.

267
00:24:16,653 --> 00:24:19,489
I can't see anything.
Can you clear out the smoke?

268
00:24:19,989 --> 00:24:21,115
Please?

269
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,243
God damn it.

270
00:25:03,241 --> 00:25:04,242
Minhye?

271
00:25:04,826 --> 00:25:06,411
My, my.

272
00:25:31,102 --> 00:25:32,103
Minhye?

273
00:25:36,357 --> 00:25:38,443
This changes everything.

274
00:25:40,611 --> 00:25:41,654
Everyone, wait!

275
00:25:42,572 --> 00:25:44,741
What the hell is Minhye doing there?

276
00:25:44,824 --> 00:25:47,827
<i>Seongjo? Is that Minhye</i>
<i>in the rabbit hole?</i>

277
00:25:48,578 --> 00:25:51,164
Minhye's Class S
holding Codes Red and Purple.

278
00:25:52,039 --> 00:25:54,125
You'll have to pay more for risk.

279
00:25:54,917 --> 00:25:57,754
Fine, just proceed.

280
00:25:57,837 --> 00:25:59,547
We don't have much time.

281
00:26:00,423 --> 00:26:03,468
Then, I'll trust you and proceed.

282
00:26:04,427 --> 00:26:05,887
-Let's proceed.
-Yes, sir.

283
00:26:06,387 --> 00:26:07,388
Yes, sir.

284
00:26:08,431 --> 00:26:11,350
God damn it. Everyone's all about money.

285
00:26:11,976 --> 00:26:12,977
Seongjo?

286
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,187
Who's Minhye?

287
00:26:16,063 --> 00:26:17,774
Just a crazy bitch.

288
00:27:07,824 --> 00:27:09,826
Now, let's begin the rabbit hunt!

289
00:27:12,829 --> 00:27:16,207
Teams 1 and 2 of Group 1
has begun the rabbit hunt.

290
00:27:16,791 --> 00:27:18,584
Fifteen hundred meters to the rabbit.

291
00:27:26,175 --> 00:27:27,677
Come back alive!

292
00:28:13,723 --> 00:28:14,807
<i>Focus.</i>

293
00:28:16,934 --> 00:28:18,603
<i>Listen up, Jian.</i>

294
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:21,731
<i>Blind spots.</i>

295
00:29:52,029 --> 00:29:53,906
<i>It's flying in from the left side.</i>

296
00:29:54,573 --> 00:29:55,700
<i>A diagonal direction?</i>

297
00:29:56,283 --> 00:30:00,287
<i>The sound of the gunshot came</i>
<i>from much higher and farther away.</i>

298
00:30:24,752 --> 00:30:25,836
What?

299
00:30:26,921 --> 00:30:28,839
Where did she go?

300
00:30:32,843 --> 00:30:34,011
-Hey, Bongo.
-Yes?

301
00:30:34,094 --> 00:30:35,220
Go forward a bit.

302
00:30:35,304 --> 00:30:36,680
Going forward a bit.

303
00:30:51,946 --> 00:30:52,947
One.

304
00:30:54,823 --> 00:30:55,824
Two.

305
00:30:56,784 --> 00:30:57,785
Three.

306
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:37,825
Have you shot a gun before?

307
00:31:40,953 --> 00:31:41,954
Yes.

308
00:31:43,789 --> 00:31:44,790
Not that one.

309
00:32:04,768 --> 00:32:07,896
When it comes to shooting,
pistols and rifles are the same anyway.

310
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,233
Pull the lever on the right
and insert the bullet.

311
00:32:12,609 --> 00:32:13,861
You just need to load it.

312
00:32:39,428 --> 00:32:40,804
What the fuck?

313
00:32:42,222 --> 00:32:43,432
Look at this bitch!

314
00:32:44,683 --> 00:32:47,061
She's Jeong Jinman's niece indeed!

315
00:33:09,625 --> 00:33:12,127
I can't believe he stuck a gun
under the sofa.

316
00:33:12,836 --> 00:33:14,755
That's just like
my dear Jinman.

317
00:33:16,924 --> 00:33:17,925
Your what?

318
00:33:18,759 --> 00:33:21,386
What... do we do now?

319
00:33:28,435 --> 00:33:30,604
The impatient always die first.

320
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,860
God damn it!

321
00:33:36,944 --> 00:33:40,447
Minhye, that bitch.
How much is she getting paid?

322
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:54,211
There's no time.

323
00:33:54,294 --> 00:33:57,089
I'll cover you. Go into the storage shed.

324
00:33:57,798 --> 00:33:58,966
The storage shed?

325
00:33:59,049 --> 00:34:01,844
Yes, on the floor
of your uncle's workroom,

326
00:34:01,927 --> 00:34:03,679
there's a door into murthehelp.

327
00:34:04,638 --> 00:34:08,350
I'm going to protect you
until you get in there safely.

328
00:34:08,433 --> 00:34:09,726
I promised your uncle.

329
00:34:13,272 --> 00:34:14,523
How can I trust you?

330
00:34:15,023 --> 00:34:16,567
Why should I listen to you?

331
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,444
Aren't you curious

332
00:34:19,945 --> 00:34:21,697
as to who your uncle really was?

333
00:34:34,042 --> 00:34:35,085
Go right now!

334
00:34:56,148 --> 00:34:57,191
Look at that.

335
00:34:58,025 --> 00:34:59,026
Mr. Kim?

336
00:34:59,776 --> 00:35:02,529
The rabbits are moving
towards the storage shed.

337
00:35:02,613 --> 00:35:05,365
Get a move on, will you?

338
00:35:06,249 --> 00:35:08,710
We just have to go through there.
Can you do it?

339
00:35:09,877 --> 00:35:10,878
Let's go.

340
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:22,724
I knew it.

341
00:35:23,391 --> 00:35:24,600
There it is.

342
00:35:30,398 --> 00:35:31,774
Jeongmin, get up!

343
00:35:46,205 --> 00:35:47,999
Got you.

344
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:13,775
That little bitch.

345
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,406
Where my uncle worked?

346
00:36:58,236 --> 00:36:59,237
What is this?

347
00:37:02,573 --> 00:37:05,284
What is it? Try his birthday.

348
00:37:05,993 --> 00:37:07,662
His birthday? Birthday...

349
00:37:13,793 --> 00:37:14,794
My birthday?

350
00:37:25,138 --> 00:37:27,056
Damn it! What is it?

351
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:28,891
Hurry up, Jian!

352
00:37:31,477 --> 00:37:32,895
<i>Listen up, Jian.</i>

353
00:37:33,688 --> 00:37:35,773
It's the same with your school ID number.

354
00:37:35,857 --> 00:37:37,775
2-2-0-1-9-0-7-4.

355
00:37:38,609 --> 00:37:41,028
2-2-0-1-9-0-7-4.

356
00:37:43,531 --> 00:37:44,866
2-2-0-1-9-0-7-4.

357
00:37:55,626 --> 00:37:56,627
It worked.

358
00:39:41,274 --> 00:39:42,316
What?

359
00:39:43,192 --> 00:39:44,568
It's really here.

360
00:40:07,967 --> 00:40:08,968
Jian.

361
00:40:15,391 --> 00:40:17,268
Oh... Hi, Jeong Jian.

362
00:40:26,193 --> 00:40:28,070
I'm Brother.

363
00:40:29,196 --> 00:40:33,951
A SHOP FOR KILLERS
