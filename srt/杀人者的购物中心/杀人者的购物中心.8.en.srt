I bet you're curious
about a lot of things.

You have no idea what's going on, do you?

By the way, I'm so sorry

256

about your parents.

killing a lot of people too.

must've had families too, right?

Just like your mom and dad.

263
00:28:37,387 --> 00:28:40,015
Well, I grew up in an orphanage,

264

so I wouldn't know much about it.

Yeongik, you'll get a bellyache
if you're too greedy.

368
00:41:57,062 --> 00:41:59,231
It would hurt me more to see you take it.

369
00:41:59,314 --> 00:42:01,775
Whatever. Anyway, I'll give up Minhye.

You take her if you have a death wish.

who used to do business with us.

Did you just ask me?

388
00:42:56,913 --> 00:42:58,415
Of course!

- Why?

- Okay.

00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:39,122
They've sent more men.

395
00:43:40,582 --> 00:43:42,501
It means she's still alive.

Don't worry.

397
00:43:53,095 --> 00:43:55,097
They can't get into the shopping mall.

Shit.

399
00:44:12,697 --> 00:44:15,033
This place is a mess.

400
00:44:15,617 --> 00:44:17,869
Are you sure
Jeong Jinman's niece is in here?

401
00:44:18,453 --> 00:44:21,456
Even if she isn't,
collecting the weapons alone is a win.

402
00:44:27,796 --> 00:44:29,548
Where's the shopping mall?

to the shoppers who came all this way.

Lee Seongjo?

413
00:45:44,581 --> 00:45:45,582
That's right.

414
00:45:46,208 --> 00:45:49,503
It's Lee Seongjo
whom I killed not too long ago.

415

Lee Seongjo?

416
00:45:56,426 --> 00:45:57,928
Six in the warehouse.

417
00:46:00,347 --> 00:46:01,890
Six in the living room.

418
00:46:03,892 --> 00:46:05,143
Six more in the garden.

As for the four-million-dollar bounty
Babylon offered,

424
00:46:22,452 --> 00:46:26,498
I will divide it evenly and wire it
to each of you without tax deductions.

425
00:46:28,792 --> 00:46:30,877
As you did with my uncle, Jeong Jinman,

426
00:46:35,799 --> 00:46:39,136
you may do business with me.

00:46:40,053 --> 00:46:41,638

Every once in a while,

429
00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:46,184
I promise to give you discounts

430
00:46:46,268 --> 00:46:48,353

00:46:56,236 --> 00:46:59,781

00:47:07,205 --> 00:47:08,206

436
00:47:15,797 --> 00:47:17,007
One.

437
00:47:19,718 --> 00:47:20,719
Two.

438
00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:26,433
Three.

439
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,778
Won't it be inconvenient
without this place?

440
00:47:38,236 --> 00:47:40,030
Plus, she'll pay us tax-free.

441
00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:42,616
Only Babylon will benefit from this.

442
00:47:44,034 --> 00:47:45,952
She's definitely Jeong Jinman's niece.

443
00:47:56,046 --> 00:47:57,130
Goodbye.

Jeong Jian is good.

Right, we all get a cut.

There's no income deduction.

00:48:11,395 --> 00:48:12,396
It's not bad.

448
00:49:03,447 --> 00:49:04,948
Never again.

449
00:49:06,533 --> 00:49:08,910
Don't make me do something
like that again.

450
00:49:25,927 --> 00:49:27,095
I should go out there.

It's still dangerous, so you should
stay inside the shopping mall.
