(SPEAKS KOREAN) Those people
on the rooftop weren't civilians.

The gun didn't even have a magazine.

There could've been a bullet
in the chamber.

The bullet lodged in Kim Seonghwan's head

148
00:12:56,488 --> 00:12:57,906
was a .45 caliber.

we collected from the rebels,

During the mission,

156
00:13:20,512 --> 00:13:25,559
did you or did you not see
the defendant killing civilians?

157
00:13:35,569 --> 00:13:38,321
(SPEAKS KOREAN) Have you ever looked
at Bale's face properly?

158
00:13:38,405 --> 00:13:41,074
- Excuse me?
- Have you ever looked him in the eye?

159
00:13:41,908 --> 00:13:44,911
He has no soul in his eyes.

160
00:13:46,329 --> 00:13:49,875
He feels no guilt about killing someone.
He's a natural combat machine.

161
00:13:50,542 --> 00:13:54,296
He could become a hero
if this were a war between nations, but...

162
00:13:58,049 --> 00:13:59,092
Anyway,

163
00:14:00,051 --> 00:14:01,219
did you know?

You and Bale are similar.

165
00:14:07,601 --> 00:14:10,187
There's something creepy about Bale.

166
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:13,732
I'm not sure if he's a human or a monster,
and he scares me sometimes,

167

but when we're together,

168
00:14:15,817 --> 00:14:17,986
it reassures me that I won't die today.

169
00:14:18,486 --> 00:14:21,573
That I won't be going to hell today.
It puts me at ease!

170
00:14:22,532 --> 00:14:24,367
But it's not like that with you.

Go on ahead. I'll stay here and...

362
00:35:59,788 --> 00:36:02,374
Sir, I'll stay behind and help you.

363
00:36:02,457 --> 00:36:06,086
No, I'm going to hand Bale over
to the inspection team when we get there.

364
00:36:06,586 --> 00:36:08,171
So make sure to stay with him.

365
00:36:52,507 --> 00:36:53,758
(IN MANDARIN) Do you want to live?

366
00:36:58,847 --> 00:37:00,098
Let's get out of here.

367
00:37:10,901 --> 00:37:12,652
(IN KOREAN) You stayed behind
to have some fun?

368
00:37:44,351 --> 00:37:45,894
- (IN MANDARIN) Run!

369
00:38:06,623 --> 00:38:08,416
(SPEAKS KOREAN) Do you know
why I'm a mercenary?

370
00:38:11,127 --> 00:38:13,129
I just like killing people.

371
00:38:14,422 --> 00:38:16,174
That's why I applied to become one.

372
00:38:18,552 --> 00:38:21,054
Because as long as I follow
some simple rules,

373
00:38:22,264 --> 00:38:24,558
I make money killing people
as much as I want.

374
00:38:27,394 --> 00:38:29,896
Protection of civilians
and no friendly fire...

375
00:38:30,438 --> 00:38:32,941
Don't try to force those principles on me.

376
00:38:34,276 --> 00:38:35,360
It makes me

377
00:38:36,111 --> 00:38:38,822
just want to kill everyone,
allies or enemies.

378
00:38:41,116 --> 00:38:43,869
In the end, we're the same type of people,

379
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,288
Jeong Jinman.

380
00:38:49,457 --> 00:38:52,002
We both get paid to kill people.

381
00:38:52,085 --> 00:38:54,588
Stop pretending to be righteous.
It makes me gag.

382
00:39:10,395 --> 00:39:12,564
That's the face you make
when you're scared.

388
00:41:54,684 --> 00:41:55,977
You listen to me.

389
00:41:57,395 --> 00:41:58,688
If you don't kill me now,

390
00:42:00,941 --> 00:42:02,150
I'm going to kill

391
00:42:03,318 --> 00:42:04,361
your entire family,

392
00:42:05,278 --> 00:42:08,281
your friends, and anyone
who has anything to do with you.

393
00:42:09,658 --> 00:42:12,369
Then, I'll kill you last.

394
00:42:14,454 --> 00:42:16,581
Die, you son of a bitch!

395
00:42:38,061 --> 00:42:40,480
(IN MANDARIN) We have to go now!
Hurry!

396
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:49,281

00:43:01,418 --> 00:43:03,253
JINMAN: (SPEAKS KOREAN)
After we set the bombs,

398
00:43:03,628 --> 00:43:05,672
as we were trying to leave the building,

399
00:43:07,048 --> 00:43:09,092
we were met with the rest of the rebels.

400
00:43:11,386 --> 00:43:14,014
They almost got me...

401
00:43:16,016 --> 00:43:17,601
when Bale came to help.

402
00:43:20,478 --> 00:43:21,771
We fought together.

403
00:43:23,106 --> 00:43:25,483
Then, the bombs went off.

404
00:43:27,694 --> 00:43:30,697
I was close to the entrance,
so I was able to escape.

405
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:32,991
But Bale...

406
00:43:37,537 --> 00:43:41,124
There was no time
to stay and recover the body.

407
00:44:11,238 --> 00:44:13,031
Is it because of what happened?

408
00:44:14,741 --> 00:44:16,201
That's one of the reasons.

409
00:44:17,577 --> 00:44:19,079
I've been working long enough.

410
00:44:19,621 --> 00:44:21,122
I want a break.

412
00:44:52,362 --> 00:44:53,363
It's me.

413
00:44:54,781 --> 00:44:57,367
Put someone on Jeong Jinman.

414
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:04,708
My word.

415
00:45:08,628 --> 00:45:09,796
Damn...

416
00:45:12,424 --> 00:45:15,427
I thought you'd be different.

417
00:45:17,637 --> 00:45:20,515
I guess psychopaths are
just as mortal as us.

418
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:35,071
What's this?

419
00:45:36,865 --> 00:45:38,366
Wow...

420
00:45:39,367 --> 00:45:40,785
Hi, baby.

421
00:45:41,536 --> 00:45:43,288
Why were you in the dark like that?

422
00:45:46,166 --> 00:45:47,709
Thanks, Bale.

423
00:46:54,442 --> 00:46:57,863
I thought Bale was made of steel.

424
00:47:00,031 --> 00:47:01,533
But he went to hell before us.

425
00:47:05,579 --> 00:47:08,081
Please attain enlightenment, Bale.

426
00:47:49,998 --> 00:47:51,541
I hear you're taking time off.

427
00:47:55,295 --> 00:47:58,715
I know it wasn't too long ago
that we almost shot each other,

428
00:47:59,716 --> 00:48:01,968
but I still think we're a team.

429
00:48:04,638 --> 00:48:05,972
I hope you come back soon.

430
00:48:07,265 --> 00:48:09,518
So that we can make more money with you.

Hey, you little bastard!

Do you have any idea what's going on?

- You call after eight years...
- It's good to hear your voice too.
