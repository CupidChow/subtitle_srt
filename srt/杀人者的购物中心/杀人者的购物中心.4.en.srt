1
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:07,936
<i>Order in the court!</i>

2
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:10,427
Prosecutor, please continue.

3
00:00:11,303 --> 00:00:12,930
Let me ask you again.

4
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:14,890
During the mission,

5
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:20,854
did you or did you not see
the defendant killing civilians?

6
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:38,664
Sir, I need your answer!

7
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:52,928
Why aren't you answering it? Isn't it Mom?

8
00:00:56,974 --> 00:00:58,016
Who is it?

9
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,560
<i>Sir, this is Juncheol.</i>

10
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:02,354
How did you get this number?

11
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:04,022
<i>That's not important right now.</i>

12
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,608
<i>Bale is still alive.</i>

13
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:08,151
<i>I can't talk for long.</i>

14
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:11,613
<i>He's on his way to your mom's funeral
with Lee Seongjo.</i>

15
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:28,630
HONDA, BALE'S ALIVE.
HE'S AFTER MY FAMILY. PROTECT JIAN.

16
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,774
Please, answer your phone! Come on!

17
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:00,495
What the hell?

18
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:04,708
I'm so sorry,

19
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,085
but my phone died.

20
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:09,004
Can I borrow your phone?

21
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:11,048
I have to call the insurance company.

22
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:42,037
Fuck!

23
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:49,086
A SHOP FOR KILLERS

24
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,341
EPISODE 4
THE SHOPPING MALL

25
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:32,355
Turn off your light!

26
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:38,051
What the fuck?

27
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:39,803
How thrilling.

28
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,367
Second floor, center!

29
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:20,761
Cease fire!

30
00:04:57,548 --> 00:05:00,133
<i>Mr. Kim, how's it going?</i>

31
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:01,218
Shit.

32
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:04,930
Come in. Mr. Kim.

33
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:07,307
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

34
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:08,392
Hey, Mr. Kim...

35
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,561
What the hell?

36
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:35,460
Today's not your lucky day.

37
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:46,054
Attain enlightenment, buddy.

38
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:55,689
What the fuck's going on?
Are they all dead?

39
00:05:56,315 --> 00:05:58,525
They can't even take
what's handed to them.

40
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:03,614
For God's sake.

41
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:10,829
What's taking you guys so long?
Hurry up, will you?

42
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,171
Shoot the ceiling!

43
00:09:16,849 --> 00:09:19,017
You should've
secured your visibility

44
00:09:19,101 --> 00:09:21,270
first in the dark, Mr. Kim.

45
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,817
You've finally lost your touch.

46
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:27,461
Minhye.

47
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:28,795
Someone like you

48
00:10:29,505 --> 00:10:31,256
is worth taking to hell with me.

49
00:11:24,977 --> 00:11:27,938
Goodbye, Mr. Kim.

50
00:11:40,117 --> 00:11:42,244
Oh... Hi, Jeong Jian.

51
00:11:44,955 --> 00:11:47,124
I'm Brother.

52
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:03,640
Put that on your wrists.

53
00:12:04,266 --> 00:12:05,934
Put it on Bae Jeongmin.

54
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:08,395
What?

55
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:11,148
How... do you know me?

56
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:36,340
What?

57
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:29,017
<i>I feel like I can spin it all night.</i>

58
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,436
<i>These six have rented out the ride.</i>

59
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,855
<i>You all must be rich.</i>

60
00:13:34,106 --> 00:13:38,819
<i>The girl with her eyes shut and the guy
in the leather jacket. Are you related?</i>

61
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:41,280
<i>- Or a couple?</i>
- Don't worry. Hold onto me.

62
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:43,365
<i>What? You're holding hands?</i>

63
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:45,784
<i>Look at that.</i>

64
00:13:45,868 --> 00:13:48,161
<i>I can't let that happen. Attack!</i>

65
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:55,961
<i>What's this? This isn't right.</i>

66
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:57,504
<i>You can't sit there.</i>

67
00:13:57,588 --> 00:13:59,506
<i>- How will you explain this?</i>
- Junmyeon.

68
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:00,632
Don't move.

69
00:14:00,716 --> 00:14:02,342
You'll fall if you move again.

70
00:14:02,426 --> 00:14:07,139
<i>By the way, this girl has
the strongest legs I have ever seen!</i>

71
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:09,141
<i>Look at her hold on!</i>

72
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:51,099
Thanks.

73
00:14:54,478 --> 00:14:56,897
I'll be going, then.

74
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,781
Jian.

75
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:09,243
You're going to leave like that?

76
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:11,036
What?

77
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:22,256
Is there something more to do
before I go in?

78
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:26,385
You really

79
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:28,846
don't have a clue, do you?

80
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:58,239
Your muffler has a hole.

81
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:00,836
I'll fix it for 50,000 won.

82
00:16:03,714 --> 00:16:05,048
This is my uncle.

83
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:07,092
What?

84
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:09,636
Oh... Hello.

85
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:17,644
Isn't it illegal for a teenager to ride
a motorcycle? No helmet, illegal mods.

86
00:16:20,189 --> 00:16:21,273
Show me your license.

87
00:16:22,858 --> 00:16:24,943
Come on, sir.

88
00:16:25,027 --> 00:16:26,820
You're so old-fashioned.

89
00:16:27,321 --> 00:16:29,823
Let the kids be lovey-dovey.

90
00:16:29,907 --> 00:16:31,658
Jian, keep going.

91
00:16:32,576 --> 00:16:34,328
Still, I need to check.

92
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:35,954
Show me your license.

93
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:40,417
I... I didn't bring it with me today.

94
00:16:42,753 --> 00:16:43,754
I should go.

95
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:45,839
Have a good night.

96
00:16:48,217 --> 00:16:49,885
I'll go with you.

97
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:52,095
- I'll call you!
- Come here.

98
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:57,336
Why are you getting on?

99
00:16:57,392 --> 00:16:58,769
Drop me off at the store.

100
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:02,814
Did you see how he didn't bow his head
as he greeted me?

101
00:17:12,491 --> 00:17:15,118
One bulgogi burger and two shrimp burgers.

102
00:17:15,202 --> 00:17:17,204
She's been working here for a while.

103
00:17:17,287 --> 00:17:20,916
Didn't you know? She works two jobs.
She works at the gimbap shop too.

104
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:22,834
She still lives with her uncle?

105
00:17:22,918 --> 00:17:25,546
It could be her uncle, lover, or pimp.
Who knows?

106
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:28,298
Hey, it's her uncle.

107
00:17:28,382 --> 00:17:29,550
- Okay.
- So sensitive.

108
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:31,510
- So sensitive.
- I'm not sensitive!

109
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:33,470
- You're disgusting.
- She's always like this.

110
00:17:33,554 --> 00:17:34,555
Why?

111
00:17:34,638 --> 00:17:35,973
Does she not have parents?

112
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,726
That's right. You wouldn't know.

113
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:41,478
You transferred in middle school.

114
00:17:41,562 --> 00:17:42,563
Listen.

115
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:44,898
Her mom and dad...

116
00:17:44,982 --> 00:17:46,692
Stop. Do you want her to hit you

117
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:48,485
- with a chair again?
- Wait! My PTSD!

118
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:49,611
My head!

119
00:17:49,695 --> 00:17:51,697
Enjoy your meal.

120
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:54,199
Minsook,
don't you hang out with her?

121
00:18:15,971 --> 00:18:17,181
Let's go somewhere else.

122
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:18,265
- Why?
- What? Why?

123
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:19,828
- Go somewhere else.
- Why?

124
00:18:19,892 --> 00:18:21,244
- What?
- Let's go. Come on.

125
00:18:21,268 --> 00:18:22,588
- What is it?
- Just...

126
00:18:22,644 --> 00:18:24,563
- Do you know her?
- She's no one.

127
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:44,666
<i>They have confiscated
400 unauthorized guns,</i>

128
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,711
<i>five crossbows, and 32 stun guns.</i>

129
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:51,590
<i>If you are caught carrying
or using weapons without a permit,</i>

130
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:54,259
<i>you could be imprisoned
for three to 15 years...</i>

131
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:04,394
Why did you act that way to Minsook?

132
00:19:07,314 --> 00:19:08,398
In middle school

133
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:10,692
when Minsook came over.

134
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:14,821
You came into my room,
stared at her for ten minutes,

135
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:17,241
and got misunderstood for a pervert.

136
00:19:17,324 --> 00:19:19,326
It lost me my only friend.

137
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:21,703
Also, my tutor, Jinki.

138
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:24,248
He was just messing around a little.

139
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:27,292
You just had to threaten him
to do his job properly

140
00:19:27,376 --> 00:19:29,920
and make him quit the next day.

141
00:19:32,381 --> 00:19:33,674
Listen up, Jian.

142
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:39,471
First off,

143
00:19:40,222 --> 00:19:43,433
Minsook stole my watch that day.

144
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:48,063
I only looked at her to confirm that.

145
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:50,691
She apologized to me
and returned my watch.

146
00:19:50,774 --> 00:19:52,526
That was the end of it.

147
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:53,610
Second,

148
00:19:53,694 --> 00:19:55,320
your tutor, Kim Jinki...

149
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,907
Well, in the end,

150
00:19:58,991 --> 00:20:01,535
he was arrested for molestation
a week later.

151
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:05,122
As your legal guardian
who must protect you,

152
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:06,957
I think I did my best.

153
00:20:12,546 --> 00:20:13,797
Then, what about Junmyeon?

154
00:20:14,715 --> 00:20:16,258
What did he do so wrong?

155
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,514
It's illegal for a high schooler
to ride a motorcycle.

156
00:20:22,598 --> 00:20:23,599
He had no helmet.

157
00:20:24,141 --> 00:20:25,392
He even smokes!

158
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:26,894
He reeked of it.

159
00:20:26,977 --> 00:20:29,021
Come on!

160
00:20:36,195 --> 00:20:37,362
Uncle.

161
00:20:37,446 --> 00:20:39,823
Do you know why I work so many jobs?

162
00:20:40,824 --> 00:20:43,869
I'm saving up to move out of here.

163
00:20:47,456 --> 00:20:49,041
I've thought about

164
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,251
why I'm so different

165
00:20:52,211 --> 00:20:53,253
from the other kids.

166
00:20:56,298 --> 00:20:58,050
I know you raised me,

167
00:20:58,926 --> 00:20:59,927
but...

168
00:21:02,513 --> 00:21:04,723
why does it feel like
you're locking me up?

169
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:14,399
I know I'm not a model student.

170
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,028
But I'm not a problem child either.

171
00:21:18,737 --> 00:21:20,906
Why do you meddle in everything?

172
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:25,661
I want to hang out with friends
like the other kids.

173
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:27,454
I want to date too.

174
00:21:28,038 --> 00:21:29,039
Am I not allowed?

175
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:31,667
Well?

176
00:21:35,963 --> 00:21:37,965
Then, make a bet with me.

177
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:41,426
My face.

178
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:45,097
I'll let you move out
if you can hit it even once.

179
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,018
I'm being serious.

180
00:21:50,102 --> 00:21:51,645
So am I.

181
00:21:53,355 --> 00:21:54,439
Are you done eating?

182
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,525
I'll put them away.

183
00:22:00,404 --> 00:22:02,114
Are you hiding something from me?

184
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:05,576
Mom and Dad...

185
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:10,080
Did they really die the way
that everyone talks about?

186
00:22:16,753 --> 00:22:18,630
Honestly, I don't remember.

187
00:22:21,216 --> 00:22:22,676
Isn't it time you told me?

188
00:22:30,475 --> 00:22:31,810
Will you take the bet?

189
00:22:33,645 --> 00:22:36,356
It took a lot for me
to bring this up to you!

190
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:38,650
What's wrong with you?

191
00:22:39,276 --> 00:22:40,861
Why do you always avoid the subject?

192
00:22:42,946 --> 00:22:44,823
Forget it if you don't want to move out.

193
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:53,123
Damn it!

194
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:55,626
You're so slow.

195
00:23:00,464 --> 00:23:01,715
You do the dishes.

196
00:23:04,843 --> 00:23:06,094
Darn it!

197
00:23:06,178 --> 00:23:07,721
You're so annoying!

198
00:23:09,598 --> 00:23:13,519
Turn right.

199
00:23:13,602 --> 00:23:16,188
There you go.

200
00:23:16,271 --> 00:23:18,398
Come on.

201
00:23:18,482 --> 00:23:20,859
Great job, Jian.

202
00:23:20,943 --> 00:23:22,528
Slowly.

203
00:23:23,278 --> 00:23:24,905
Bring it down.

204
00:23:24,988 --> 00:23:26,114
Okay!

205
00:23:26,198 --> 00:23:28,700
Wow, Jian!

206
00:23:30,244 --> 00:23:31,245
You pass.

207
00:23:31,828 --> 00:23:33,121
You've got a knack for it.

208
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:35,832
Great job.

209
00:24:14,037 --> 00:24:16,456
Put the forklift back where it was
and come eat.

210
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:19,001
Darn it.

211
00:24:25,674 --> 00:24:26,675
Damn it.

212
00:24:29,261 --> 00:24:30,971
Move! Move!

213
00:24:31,054 --> 00:24:32,639
I said move!

214
00:24:33,348 --> 00:24:34,433
Get out of my way!

215
00:24:35,976 --> 00:24:38,061
What are you doing, Jian?

216
00:24:38,145 --> 00:24:39,521
You're scaring me!

217
00:24:39,605 --> 00:24:41,190
Fighting with your family

218
00:24:41,273 --> 00:24:42,691
makes you a bitch.

219
00:24:42,941 --> 00:24:45,152
Stay out of it!
It's a family matter, Pasin!

220
00:24:50,949 --> 00:24:52,201
Did you just hit me?

221
00:24:52,284 --> 00:24:55,579
You're too slow. You're like a slug.

222
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:57,372
You won't even touch his hair.

223
00:24:57,456 --> 00:24:58,665
Can't touch.

224
00:25:03,253 --> 00:25:05,547
Why are you all on my case?

225
00:25:07,299 --> 00:25:08,467
Let go of me!

226
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:09,718
Let go!

227
00:25:09,801 --> 00:25:11,220
Let go of me!

228
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,096
Hey! Let go!

229
00:25:18,352 --> 00:25:19,353
Let...

230
00:25:38,705 --> 00:25:40,145
You're getting it all wrong.

231
00:25:40,207 --> 00:25:43,001
How do you get it wrong every time?

232
00:25:44,086 --> 00:25:46,171
You're so annoying.
Worry about yourself.

233
00:25:57,516 --> 00:25:58,684
I took it out!

234
00:25:59,393 --> 00:26:01,311
Look. You got it wrong again.

235
00:26:01,395 --> 00:26:03,564
How do you keep getting
the distance wrong?

236
00:26:04,064 --> 00:26:05,691
Stop nagging me.

237
00:26:09,027 --> 00:26:10,028
Did I...

238
00:26:11,405 --> 00:26:12,906
pass out?

239
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:14,366
Jian is up.

240
00:26:15,242 --> 00:26:17,703
You must've been tired.
Don't study so hard.

241
00:26:19,454 --> 00:26:21,290
Did I pass out?

242
00:26:22,833 --> 00:26:23,834
Yes.

243
00:26:26,503 --> 00:26:27,629
How could you

244
00:26:28,213 --> 00:26:30,674
make your niece pass out?

245
00:26:30,757 --> 00:26:32,134
- What?
- She's right.

246
00:26:33,552 --> 00:26:35,262
I didn't do it. He did.

247
00:26:35,345 --> 00:26:36,763
Right. What?

248
00:26:38,223 --> 00:26:41,101
You're shameless, Jinman.
You told me to do it.

249
00:26:42,477 --> 00:26:43,520
When did I?

250
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,481
You're such a liar.

251
00:26:46,565 --> 00:26:49,026
Fuck you... Die!

252
00:26:49,109 --> 00:26:52,905
You told me to do it. You made me.

253
00:26:52,988 --> 00:26:54,239
Unbelievable. When?

254
00:26:56,867 --> 00:26:58,118
Hey!

255
00:27:02,539 --> 00:27:04,499
Put the forklift back where it was.

256
00:27:31,235 --> 00:27:32,611
What's your hand?

257
00:27:34,112 --> 00:27:35,239
Give me your head.

258
00:27:39,701 --> 00:27:41,036
You lose, you get hit.

259
00:27:42,538 --> 00:27:43,622
Bums.

260
00:27:44,122 --> 00:27:45,123
Pay first.

261
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:47,668
Okay.

262
00:27:50,379 --> 00:27:53,382
Pasin, what you did to me earlier.

263
00:27:53,882 --> 00:27:54,883
Teach me how to do it.

264
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:04,685
You want me to teach you Muay Thai
so you can hit Jinman?

265
00:28:05,394 --> 00:28:06,395
Yes.

266
00:28:07,813 --> 00:28:08,814
No.

267
00:28:09,565 --> 00:28:11,149
Yes, Master.

268
00:28:13,694 --> 00:28:16,655
Just creep up on him
and hit him while he's sleeping.

269
00:28:18,532 --> 00:28:19,533
Oh...

270
00:28:22,244 --> 00:28:24,997
But isn't that cheating?

271
00:28:26,081 --> 00:28:27,416
It seems too easy too.

272
00:28:29,418 --> 00:28:30,836
Do you think it'd be easy?

273
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:38,093
I want to move out of my uncle's place.

274
00:28:38,719 --> 00:28:40,721
He's frustrating. I can't live with him.

275
00:28:42,222 --> 00:28:45,309
The Muay Thai that I do is tough.

276
00:28:45,392 --> 00:28:46,685
You can't do it.

277
00:28:46,768 --> 00:28:47,769
I can.

278
00:28:48,729 --> 00:28:51,064
I'll do everything you tell me to do.

279
00:28:55,569 --> 00:28:58,614
Three times a week. 500,000 won a month.

280
00:29:00,532 --> 00:29:03,493
I'm in high school.
I don't have that kind of money.

281
00:29:05,204 --> 00:29:06,288
Jian.

282
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:11,877
I have to send my son
to a private school next year.

283
00:29:12,628 --> 00:29:16,048
So I need a lot of money,
but I don't have any right now.

284
00:29:17,633 --> 00:29:18,967
I should just die.

285
00:29:23,514 --> 00:29:25,599
Even with my paychecks,

286
00:29:27,392 --> 00:29:29,561
the most I can get is 50,000 won a week.

287
00:29:32,648 --> 00:29:33,649
Deal.

288
00:29:42,783 --> 00:29:43,784
Follow me.

289
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,261
Wow.

290
00:30:14,439 --> 00:30:16,108
First lesson.

291
00:30:16,191 --> 00:30:17,860
We're starting now?

292
00:30:19,486 --> 00:30:20,487
Try to block me.

293
00:30:27,035 --> 00:30:28,036
One, two.

294
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,122
- One, two.
- Keep your elbows up.

295
00:30:30,205 --> 00:30:31,456
Always remember this box.

296
00:30:37,921 --> 00:30:39,173
Don't lose balance.

297
00:30:52,561 --> 00:30:55,147
<i>Why do you play with my heart?</i>

298
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,398
Jian?

299
00:30:56,481 --> 00:30:58,317
{\an8}<i>With you...</i>

300
00:30:59,484 --> 00:31:01,320
You're too stiff.

301
00:31:01,403 --> 00:31:02,446
You're all talk.

302
00:31:16,293 --> 00:31:17,461
Barely breaks even.

303
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:20,297
One, two.

304
00:31:21,924 --> 00:31:22,925
You're a slug.

305
00:31:25,219 --> 00:31:27,179
Slug, you're so slow!

306
00:31:27,262 --> 00:31:28,805
Get up, Slug.

307
00:31:33,769 --> 00:31:34,853
Hello!

308
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:49,701
What are you doing?

309
00:31:54,414 --> 00:31:56,959
- Put me down.
- So slow, Slug.

310
00:32:08,512 --> 00:32:12,182
<i>I must've been nothing to you</i>

311
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:32,596
- Hey, hurry...
- Jian?

312
00:33:34,515 --> 00:33:35,516
What the hell?

313
00:33:44,691 --> 00:33:45,692
You're pretty.

314
00:33:47,361 --> 00:33:49,404
Who were those kids? Your friends?

315
00:33:49,488 --> 00:33:50,656
We're better than them.

316
00:33:51,365 --> 00:33:52,866
Did we scare you?

317
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:54,493
You're a pretty thing.

318
00:33:54,576 --> 00:33:56,578
- Hey, show us your face.
- Cha Minsook?

319
00:33:56,662 --> 00:33:57,871
- Hey.
- Jian!

320
00:34:01,625 --> 00:34:02,709
- Hey!
- What the hell?

321
00:34:02,793 --> 00:34:03,794
What the fuck?

322
00:34:05,546 --> 00:34:08,590
- Damn.
- Who the fuck are you?

323
00:34:10,133 --> 00:34:13,387
You ruined everything!

324
00:34:16,431 --> 00:34:19,184
What is that? Green onions?
Is this a fucking joke?

325
00:34:19,268 --> 00:34:21,645
This is good. I was hungry.
I'm craving <i>ramyeon.</i>

326
00:34:22,646 --> 00:34:23,647
Hey.

327
00:34:24,147 --> 00:34:26,650
She ran away,
so you have to make up for it.

328
00:34:27,943 --> 00:34:29,069
Can you handle it?

329
00:34:31,238 --> 00:34:32,239
Fuck.

330
00:34:32,906 --> 00:34:35,325
Who the fuck am I talking to?

331
00:34:36,493 --> 00:34:37,870
What? What's that glare?

332
00:34:40,038 --> 00:34:42,749
What is it? What are you trying to do?

333
00:34:53,385 --> 00:34:55,387
Damn. Are you a boxer or something?

334
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:57,556
What is it? Do you want to play?

335
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,443
What the...

336
00:35:36,345 --> 00:35:38,472
You must not be from around here.
That's enough.

337
00:35:41,808 --> 00:35:43,644
Hey!

338
00:36:19,346 --> 00:36:20,347
Listen up, Jian.

339
00:36:22,516 --> 00:36:25,853
I know you've become stronger
after learning to fight from Pasin,

340
00:36:27,354 --> 00:36:28,730
but it's not enough

341
00:36:29,314 --> 00:36:31,275
to beat a man holding a knife.

342
00:36:33,819 --> 00:36:35,112
Just run away next time.

343
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,701
Drop me off at Master Pasin's place.

344
00:36:42,244 --> 00:36:45,747
My money!
I need my 350,000 won to pay rent!

345
00:36:45,831 --> 00:36:47,916
I haven't seen him
for two or three days.

346
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:51,479
- He took 500,000 won from me.
- Everyone, calm down.

347
00:36:51,503 --> 00:36:52,963
We're checking everything now.

348
00:36:53,046 --> 00:36:56,091
- Just wait.
- What's going on?

349
00:36:56,175 --> 00:36:57,342
Jian!

350
00:36:57,426 --> 00:36:58,719
Pasin, that bastard!

351
00:36:59,178 --> 00:37:01,054
He borrowed money and ran off.

352
00:37:01,138 --> 00:37:02,681
- What?
- Not just me!

353
00:37:02,764 --> 00:37:05,434
Everyone here lent him money.

354
00:37:06,894 --> 00:37:09,438
What do we do? We're done for!

355
00:37:09,521 --> 00:37:11,148
Is there a Jeong Jian here?

356
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:12,691
That's me.

357
00:37:21,491 --> 00:37:25,120
<i>Jian, you're not a slug anymore.</i>

358
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,900
What is this?

359
00:37:39,092 --> 00:37:40,260
Is that your school?

360
00:37:48,227 --> 00:37:50,270
There's one in the bathroom.

361
00:38:03,742 --> 00:38:04,993
You're insane!

362
00:38:12,501 --> 00:38:14,962
Who are you?
How long have you been watching me?

363
00:38:15,045 --> 00:38:16,296
Who made all of this?

364
00:38:18,298 --> 00:38:19,299
Was it my uncle?

365
00:38:19,842 --> 00:38:21,510
It's not the time for this, Jian.

366
00:38:22,135 --> 00:38:24,012
Minhye is out of bullets.

367
00:38:24,096 --> 00:38:26,014
More guys will come soon!

368
00:38:26,098 --> 00:38:28,809
It won't stop here. The boss said so!

369
00:38:29,643 --> 00:38:33,438
Minhye can't die if we want to stop them.

370
00:38:33,522 --> 00:38:37,943
We have to go out there
and give her more bullets and medicine!

371
00:38:39,236 --> 00:38:41,113
What the hell are you saying?

372
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,340
Wait... That's too bright!

373
00:39:00,424 --> 00:39:02,050
That's too bright! It's bright!

374
00:39:02,759 --> 00:39:05,637
Xeroderma... pigmentosum.

375
00:39:05,721 --> 00:39:07,097
Xeroderma pigmentosum!

376
00:39:07,681 --> 00:39:08,682
If... I...

377
00:39:08,765 --> 00:39:10,475
If I'm exposed to light...

378
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:12,269
for a long time, it hurts!

379
00:39:12,352 --> 00:39:14,354
Turn off the lights...

380
00:39:14,438 --> 00:39:17,191
Hurry! Turn off the lights!

381
00:39:17,274 --> 00:39:18,984
You haven't answered me yet!

382
00:39:23,822 --> 00:39:25,115
What is all of this?

383
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:27,701
How long have you been watching me
from here?

384
00:39:55,354 --> 00:39:57,314
You came to this house...

385
00:39:57,898 --> 00:40:01,068
on June 26, 2009.

386
00:40:01,151 --> 00:40:03,111
I came to this house

387
00:40:03,195 --> 00:40:05,656
on June 20, 2009.

388
00:40:05,739 --> 00:40:07,241
In just...

389
00:40:12,454 --> 00:40:13,705
We have to be careful.

390
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:17,084
He's pretending to be pitiful
to evoke sympathy.

391
00:40:20,671 --> 00:40:22,673
I don't know why he's here,

392
00:40:24,174 --> 00:40:25,926
but it's true he spied on you.

393
00:40:29,555 --> 00:40:32,558
I'm going to try to figure out
the shopping mall's system.

394
00:40:32,641 --> 00:40:35,310
We'll be able to get
proper information on your uncle.

395
00:40:35,811 --> 00:40:36,812
Okay.

396
00:40:51,869 --> 00:40:52,870
What is this?

397
00:40:54,329 --> 00:40:56,164
Why does a mere weapons shopping mall

398
00:40:57,416 --> 00:40:59,209
have a server room like this?

399
00:41:10,929 --> 00:41:12,264
Jeong... Jian!

400
00:41:16,059 --> 00:41:17,603
Don't trust him!

401
00:42:27,339 --> 00:42:29,174
Hey, open this right now!

402
00:42:37,182 --> 00:42:38,267
Damn it!

403
00:43:15,179 --> 00:43:16,219
What's going on?

404
00:43:34,072 --> 00:43:35,449
What do I do now?

405
00:43:35,532 --> 00:43:37,367
No.

406
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:45,542
Let me go.

407
00:43:50,964 --> 00:43:52,758
Get this off me, asshole.

408
00:44:24,998 --> 00:44:26,124
<i>Jeong Jian?</i>

409
00:44:27,626 --> 00:44:30,504
<i>Open the second drawer to your right.</i>

410
00:44:46,645 --> 00:44:47,855
MURTHEHELP
HANDOVER GUIDE

411
00:44:57,614 --> 00:44:58,782
<i>One.</i>

412
00:44:59,992 --> 00:45:01,660
<i>If the owner of murthehelp,</i>

413
00:45:01,743 --> 00:45:04,538
<i>Jeong Jinman, dies or is absent
due to an accident,</i>

414
00:45:04,621 --> 00:45:06,790
<i>then Jeong Jinman's niece, Jeong Jian,</i>

415
00:45:06,874 --> 00:45:09,084
<i>will inherit murthehelp.</i>

416
00:45:09,167 --> 00:45:12,087
Two. After Jeong Jian inherits murthehelp,

417
00:45:12,171 --> 00:45:16,842
she will faithfully cooperate
with the handover and carry out her duties

418
00:45:16,925 --> 00:45:21,597
<i>such as accounting,
management, and personnel tasks.</i>

419
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:22,681
<i>Three!</i>

420
00:45:23,182 --> 00:45:25,767
<i>During the handover, Jeong Jian</i>

421
00:45:26,310 --> 00:45:28,478
<i>is allowed to give up her inheritance.</i>

422
00:45:28,562 --> 00:45:30,647
<i>She'll take responsibility after signing.</i>

423
00:45:30,731 --> 00:45:36,361
<i>Six. Whether the handover proceeds
according to these regulations...</i>

424
00:45:36,445 --> 00:45:38,572
<i>The necessary measures must be taken.</i>

425
00:45:38,655 --> 00:45:40,157
<i>Ten.</i>

426
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,825
<i>As an employee of murthehelp,</i>

427
00:45:41,909 --> 00:45:46,246
I promise to obey
whatever the owner of murthehelp orders,

428
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:47,706
no matter what.

429
00:45:47,789 --> 00:45:50,834
I also promise to risk my life if need be.

430
00:45:51,585 --> 00:45:53,337
<i>I... read it all.</i>

431
00:45:54,087 --> 00:45:58,675
<i>Now, tell me if you consent to take over</i>

432
00:45:59,426 --> 00:46:00,427
<i>murthehelp.</i>

433
00:46:01,595 --> 00:46:03,972
Do you see a pen and paper in there?

434
00:46:12,397 --> 00:46:13,982
I CONSENT

435
00:46:19,571 --> 00:46:21,615
YOU'LL REALLY OBEY ME?

436
00:46:32,042 --> 00:46:33,293
GET ME OUT OF HERE NOW!

437
00:46:58,151 --> 00:47:00,654
The boss planned all of this.

438
00:47:00,737 --> 00:47:01,864
He expected

439
00:47:01,947 --> 00:47:05,659
that he would die
and murthehelp would be attacked.

440
00:47:05,742 --> 00:47:07,661
Now, just follow my guide...

441
00:47:10,873 --> 00:47:11,915
Let Jeongmin

442
00:47:12,666 --> 00:47:13,667
go.

443
00:47:17,504 --> 00:47:18,505
No.

444
00:47:19,506 --> 00:47:20,507
I... can't.

445
00:47:20,632 --> 00:47:22,801
You said you'd risk your life and obey me.

446
00:47:24,386 --> 00:47:25,679
That's what you said.

447
00:47:26,805 --> 00:47:27,806
Don't you remember?

448
00:47:29,808 --> 00:47:31,935
Let Jeongmin go!

449
00:47:36,899 --> 00:47:37,900
Anything but...

450
00:47:38,442 --> 00:47:39,443
Not that...

451
00:47:40,986 --> 00:47:42,404
There's a reason for this.

452
00:47:42,988 --> 00:47:44,239
What is it?

453
00:47:46,408 --> 00:47:47,743
The boss...

454
00:47:50,537 --> 00:47:52,122
died because of Bae Jeongmin.

455
00:48:14,061 --> 00:48:15,145
Jeongmin!

456
00:48:24,863 --> 00:48:25,948
Stop it.

457
00:48:27,574 --> 00:48:28,825
What are you doing, Jian?

458
00:48:29,993 --> 00:48:33,080
Do you... Do you seriously believe him?

459
00:48:39,795 --> 00:48:41,380
Shut up!

460
00:48:49,179 --> 00:48:50,180
No.

461
00:48:50,806 --> 00:48:51,807
No, Jian.

462
00:48:52,516 --> 00:48:53,517
Jian.

463
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:56,144
Think about it.

464
00:48:56,979 --> 00:48:58,105
I was with you

465
00:48:58,188 --> 00:49:00,357
when we almost died upstairs an hour ago.

466
00:49:00,983 --> 00:49:02,776
And a strange woman drugged me.

467
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:04,027
Don't you remember?

468
00:49:05,445 --> 00:49:07,656
I helped build the hardware website.

469
00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:10,242
I helped with your uncle's funeral!

470
00:49:10,325 --> 00:49:12,244
But I'm the one that made him die?

471
00:49:12,327 --> 00:49:15,372
You probably erased
the evidence during the funeral.

472
00:49:16,081 --> 00:49:17,124
Erased what?

473
00:49:17,207 --> 00:49:20,252
I'm the one that found his phone,
and because of that

474
00:49:20,335 --> 00:49:22,421
all of this happened and I almost died.

475
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:27,926
Jian.

476
00:49:28,677 --> 00:49:30,012
What about him?

477
00:49:30,095 --> 00:49:32,306
How do we know why or when he came here?

478
00:49:32,931 --> 00:49:36,018
He's been here in the basement
while you two lived upstairs?

479
00:49:37,561 --> 00:49:38,645
Does that make sense?

480
00:49:39,146 --> 00:49:40,939
Is he a parasite or what?

481
00:49:41,023 --> 00:49:42,357
Jeong... Jian.

482
00:49:44,151 --> 00:49:46,236
Don't you think... it's strange?

483
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,487
Shut your mouth!

484
00:49:48,530 --> 00:49:50,949
You're a pervert
who spied on Jian's naked body!

485
00:49:51,033 --> 00:49:52,034
No!

486
00:49:55,704 --> 00:49:57,080
Your uncle...

487
00:49:58,415 --> 00:50:01,376
would never commit suicide.

488
00:50:06,006 --> 00:50:07,382
Jian.

489
00:50:07,966 --> 00:50:09,843
- Jian, don't listen to him...
- Wait!

490
00:50:15,641 --> 00:50:17,559
I want to hear what he has to say.

491
00:50:22,147 --> 00:50:24,399
Of course. Sure, Jian.

492
00:50:25,025 --> 00:50:27,694
But... But think carefully about it.

493
00:50:29,238 --> 00:50:31,490
This is ridiculous and so unfair.

494
00:50:31,573 --> 00:50:32,574
Okay?

495
00:50:39,039 --> 00:50:40,332
Keep going.

496
00:50:42,334 --> 00:50:43,835
He came to your uncle.

497
00:50:44,670 --> 00:50:46,797
Then, the boss died.

498
00:50:47,673 --> 00:50:49,049
If you're curious,

499
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,969
open the video file labeled "0404"

500
00:50:52,928 --> 00:50:55,097
on the main screen of the computer.

501
00:50:57,558 --> 00:50:58,642
You...

502
00:50:58,725 --> 00:51:00,143
What are you up to?

503
00:51:00,727 --> 00:51:01,854
Are you a hacker?

504
00:51:23,041 --> 00:51:24,167
No!

505
00:51:24,835 --> 00:51:27,754
No, don't click it.

506
00:51:27,838 --> 00:51:29,173
The moment you click it,

507
00:51:29,256 --> 00:51:30,924
we don't know what will happen.

508
00:51:31,008 --> 00:51:32,968
The doors here could be disarmed.

509
00:51:33,051 --> 00:51:35,053
And the killers might get in.

510
00:51:35,929 --> 00:51:37,931
Look at the facilities here, Jian.

511
00:51:38,015 --> 00:51:39,057
No.

512
00:51:40,767 --> 00:51:42,561
Just hurry up and click it.

513
00:51:42,644 --> 00:51:43,645
Watch it.

514
00:51:43,729 --> 00:51:46,440
He could've controlled everything in here
to kill us.

515
00:51:46,523 --> 00:51:49,151
No, no, no! That's not true!

516
00:51:49,234 --> 00:51:50,402
He's lying!

517
00:51:50,485 --> 00:51:52,446
Just click it and watch the video!

518
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:58,327
Jian... Wait, Jian...

519
00:51:58,410 --> 00:51:59,411
Do you remember?

520
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:02,706
When you were locked
in the school storage room,

521
00:52:03,999 --> 00:52:06,627
the person who told your uncle
that you were there...

522
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:09,546
was me.

523
00:52:27,189 --> 00:52:28,190
Here.

524
00:52:28,941 --> 00:52:29,942
Here!

525
00:52:56,593 --> 00:52:57,886
<i>Listen up, Jian.</i>

526
00:53:06,061 --> 00:53:09,189
{\an8}JIAN
13 YEARS OLD

527
00:53:09,273 --> 00:53:10,524
Whatever you choose,

528
00:53:10,607 --> 00:53:12,359
I'll leave it to you to decide.

529
00:53:13,026 --> 00:53:14,361
What will you do?

530
00:53:15,279 --> 00:53:17,739
Do you want to raise it
or take it to the shelter?

531
00:53:22,202 --> 00:53:23,203
I want to raise it.

532
00:53:23,871 --> 00:53:25,372
I already gave it a name.

533
00:53:26,039 --> 00:53:27,040
Dooney.

534
00:53:27,833 --> 00:53:29,668
I'm going to make sure Dooney lives.

535
00:53:32,004 --> 00:53:33,630
All right. Do that.

536
00:53:35,257 --> 00:53:36,258
However...

537
00:53:37,009 --> 00:53:38,051
Listen up, Jian.

538
00:53:41,013 --> 00:53:43,557
Every choice you make
comes with responsibilities.

539
00:53:45,517 --> 00:53:47,186
If Dooney gets sick and dies,

540
00:53:48,437 --> 00:53:51,940
you must take responsibility
for your sadness too.

541
00:54:26,975 --> 00:54:27,976
You go.

542
00:54:29,937 --> 00:54:30,938
Go

543
00:54:31,855 --> 00:54:33,815
And give that woman guns and medicine.

544
00:54:42,908 --> 00:54:44,201
Okay.

545
00:55:08,851 --> 00:55:11,103
This... is a gift.

546
00:55:16,108 --> 00:55:18,235
Can you hand me the beanie?

547
00:55:29,913 --> 00:55:30,914
Oh, right.

548
00:55:31,373 --> 00:55:32,374
Do not,

549
00:55:32,916 --> 00:55:34,501
under any circumstances,

550
00:55:34,585 --> 00:55:37,171
come outside of the shopping mall.

551
00:55:39,631 --> 00:55:40,841
Promise!

552
00:55:41,425 --> 00:55:42,551
Don't.

553
00:56:16,418 --> 00:56:17,419
Who are you?

554
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:21,381
Minhye.

555
00:56:22,049 --> 00:56:23,050
It's me.

556
00:56:34,061 --> 00:56:35,812
It's been a long time.

557
00:56:39,983 --> 00:56:40,984
You've grown a lot.

558
00:56:44,613 --> 00:56:45,614
Are you okay?

559
00:56:56,291 --> 00:56:57,709
Jian.

560
00:56:57,793 --> 00:56:59,044
Thank you so much.

561
00:56:59,127 --> 00:57:01,588
Thank you so much for choosing me.

562
00:57:04,216 --> 00:57:05,676
Yes, sure...

563
00:57:10,389 --> 00:57:11,390
But...

564
00:57:11,932 --> 00:57:12,975
did you know?

565
00:57:14,852 --> 00:57:16,144
When we were young,

566
00:57:17,312 --> 00:57:18,981
the person that locked you in...

567
00:57:20,983 --> 00:57:22,067
was also me.

568
00:57:39,668 --> 00:57:40,919
What was that?

569
00:57:58,520 --> 00:57:59,980
I got a dose of that earlier.

570
00:58:02,191 --> 00:58:03,358
It works pretty well.

571
00:58:40,812 --> 00:58:42,439
Dooney...

572
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:55,744
You...

573
00:58:56,578 --> 00:58:58,080
Who are you?

574
00:59:04,378 --> 00:59:09,132
A SHOP FOR KILLERS

575
00:59:25,899 --> 00:59:27,025
Wow.

576
00:59:27,568 --> 00:59:28,735
How do you use this?

577
00:59:28,819 --> 00:59:31,947
Does it have a button?
Is that it? One, two, three.

578
00:59:34,074 --> 00:59:35,075
What the heck?

579
00:59:35,158 --> 00:59:36,201
Damn!

580
00:59:37,286 --> 00:59:40,873
You control it with that computer?
It's like a game controller.

581
00:59:40,956 --> 00:59:41,957
Wow...
