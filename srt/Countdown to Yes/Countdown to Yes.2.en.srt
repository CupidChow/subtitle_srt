1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:02,700
Let's say goodbye here.

2
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:08,900
Let's find time to eat together again soon.

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,560
See ya!

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,240
Wataru.

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,680
Hm?

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,360
How about you...

7
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:21,370
Live with me? [TN: Like couples do.]

8
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:25,520
Huh?

9
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,090
Wataru?

10
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,080
Ah, ah...

11
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,400
You mean... live together again?

12
00:00:53,795 --> 00:00:55,366
Live together, huh... Live together.
[TN: Like cohabitate]

13
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:56,200
Not like that...

14
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:57,600
- Then no.
- Why not?

15
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:58,850
No reason.

16
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,790
Then, please, can't you?

17
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:05,450
No.

18
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,950
If I look away now...

19
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,490
You don't have to glare at me like that.

20
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:21,620
I get it.

21
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:23,880
I'll ask you out again.

22
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,100
There won't be a 'next time'.

23
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:26,330
I'm leaving then.

24
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,660
Calm down...

25
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,460
Minato is just naturally air-headed.

26
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,050
It must have been a slip of the tongue.

27
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:00,050
Probably.

28
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:03,310
Ah... Please give me a break.

29
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,180
How about you...

30
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,230
Live with me?

31
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,360
I need to calm down.

32
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,200
"Countdown To Yes"

33
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,100
(Episode 2)

34
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,190
I'm home.

35
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,960
Welcome back.

36
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,190
Grandma's already asleep.

37
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,640
Be quiet.

38
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,840
What have you been shooting with lately?

39
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,320
Still the same.

40
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,790
Still the film camera my grandpa gave me.

41
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,030
And old lenses.

42
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,530
You really like it, don't you?

43
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:20,290
Yeah.

44
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,906
(September 16, 2015)
Shouldn't you adjust the settings on this?

45
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,130
That's not what I mean.

46
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:35,680
I'm saying that this out-of-focus
blur is the charm of old lenses.

47
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,540
But doesn't that mean it's out of focus?

48
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,940
It's not like only in-focus
photos are good photos, right?

49
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,720
It's not perfect, but it's warm.

50
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:49,320
That's why I... like Minato's photos.

51
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:55,970
Huh?

52
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,480
Are you mad?

53
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:58,530
Why?

54
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,170
I mean, I really do like them.

55
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,630
If it were me, I couldn't
capture this feeling.

56
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:06,360
But that's what's interesting
about photography.

57
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:11,210
All done, let's go home.

58
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,540
- Let's go back.
- Let's go.

59
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:13,900
Okay, let's go home.

60
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,530
Ah, let's go.

61
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:18,770
Minato, you come back with us too.

62
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:21,740
Okay.

63
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,560
- Want to go look at CDs?
- Can't you just stream it?

64
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,900
I'm not very good with that.

65
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,876
- You still don't know how to use it?
- What's your problem?

66
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,030
I want to go to the beach.

67
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,956
- Ah, never mind, let's go to the beach then.
- Okay.

68
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,190
Alright, the beach it is.

69
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:43,900
Sounds good, right?

70
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,430
- Let's go, let's go!
- Hurry up, let's go!

71
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:49,050
Ah, but today's homework...
What about homework?

72
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,320
Let's go too.

73
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,480
When do you feel like taking photos?

74
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,110
When I want to preserve this feeling.

75
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:17,070
What about you, Wataru?

76
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,540
Me, well...

77
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,490
Probably... when I don't
want to forget something.

78
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,680
I want to take photos that...

79
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,600
as soon as you see them, you can recall...

80
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:32,770
the sounds and smells of that moment.

81
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,280
No, go study!

82
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,500
All you do is play all day.

83
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,930
Don't say that, you're not one to talk.

84
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,540
So Yokoi is that kind of person, huh?

85
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,960
It's my first time seeing
him laugh like that.

86
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:53,220
- Ah, Shioiri.
- You guys are still taking photos?

87
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:54,910
I bought juice.

88
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:57,480
Sorry, sorry.

89
00:06:57,481 --> 00:06:59,160
Why'd you have to spray me?

90
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,250
Give me a drink.

91
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:04,230
- Why are you drinking it first?! I bought it!
- Mom will scold you!

92
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,140
Even if my mom scolds
me, I'm still going to drink it.

93
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,700
Want to see?

94
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:11,450
I like it.

95
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:12,450
Huh?

96
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,510
I like Wataru's photos.

97
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,010
That's an exaggeration, but I'm happy.

98
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,230
That's great!

99
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,620
Come on!

100
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,640
Sorry.

101
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:35,540
Ready.

102
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:36,580
Stop! Stop!

103
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:42,410
Don't stop~ Don't stop.

104
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,260
So dangerous...

105
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:46,330
Really dangerous.

106
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:47,950
What?

107
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:50,910
- Who is it?
- Who's coming?

108
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:55,030
- Let's decide with that.
- Okay, okay.

109
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,050
What do you want to do?

110
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:04,606
[TN: They're playing a word-game]
Being told 'This is chirashi sushi!'

111
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:07,279
But not actually being that
excited is common. (Ends with 'chi')

112
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,050
Fujisawa, your turn.

113
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:16,000
Feeling a little nauseous when a
globe spins fastest is also common.

114
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:17,810
Ebina, your turn.

115
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:23,789
Something that's right nearby...

116
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:27,230
But you can't see it, that's also common.

117
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,720
Yokoi, your turn.

118
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,550
Always...

119
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,819
Hey! Don't drag Minato into
this weird word chain game!

120
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:38,160
- Why are you excluding him?
- Yeah, yeah!

121
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:39,800
This is team spirit...

122
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:45,200
Don't end with 'ng'!

123
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,230
Go on!

124
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,960
Here!

125
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:55,890
Ah.

126
00:08:55,891 --> 00:08:57,920
It's easy to accidentally
pick up small stones.

127
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,560
Oh~ That's amazing!

128
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,370
Then Wataru's turn.

129
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:13,190
(September 20, 2015)
I wish the school had a darkroom.

130
00:09:13,436 --> 00:09:15,526
I'm the only one who uses
film anyway, so it's not needed.

131
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,270
Really?

132
00:09:16,271 --> 00:09:18,750
But darkrooms are cool.

133
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,520
That's true.

134
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,890
Having said that...

135
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,830
Huh?

136
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,940
A film camera.

137
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,890
I bought it with my saved New Year's money.

138
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,180
It's second-hand, though.

139
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,560
You accidentally influenced me.

140
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,820
Here you go, thanks for waiting.

141
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,420
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

142
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:01,970
Ready...

143
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:07,180
Minato's photos...

144
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:09,110
They give off a nostalgic feeling.

145
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,289
As for mine...

146
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:12,350
They really do.

147
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,840
They make you reminisce.

148
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,020
Right?

149
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,510
Wataru's photos...

150
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,220
Are the kind you want to keep close.

151
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,130
What kind of way is that to put it?

152
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,950
They're photos you want to cherish.

153
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,880
I...

154
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,530
I still like Wataru's photos.

155
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:30,270
I also...

156
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:31,910
Like Minato's photos.

157
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,750
I...

158
00:10:42,751 --> 00:10:44,230
Like Wataru's photos.

159
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:46,780
I also...

160
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,940
Like Minato's photos.

161
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,200
Thank you.

162
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:52,970
Same to you.

163
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,480
By the way...

164
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:56,830
So scary.

165
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:06,730
You really like it, huh?

166
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,570
Want to take one?

167
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,630
Can I?

168
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,300
(What is cohabitation?)

169
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:42,499
(The term 'dousei' refers to living in the same
house, specifically for couples living together.

170
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,888
On the other hand, 'doukyo'
refers to people like family or

What do you think he's thinking?

175
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,720
He's probably not thinking anything.

176
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:20,090
That's true.

177
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,300
It is Minato, after all.

178
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,420
Hmm...

179
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,600
It's because he's
inscrutable that he's Minato.

180
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,390
Minato is a friend...

181
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,000
Minato is a friend.

00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:32,910
Minato is...

183
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,520
A best friend.

00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,860
Hello?

186
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:00,540
Oh, Wataru.

187
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,440
Are you free next Friday?

188
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,980
Let's have a celebration
for Minato's promotion.

189
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,780
Promotion?

190
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:18,500
(September 12, 2025)

191
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,290
- Manager.
- Hm?

192
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:22,490
What does 'promotion' mean?

193
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:24,760
It means getting a higher position at work.

194
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,520
Being moved to a more important role.

195
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:29,450
Why are you suddenly asking that?

196
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,240
Ah, tonight...

197
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:34,060
There's a promotion party for Minato.

198
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,840
Minato-kun, huh...

199
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:41,370
Wow, he's really working hard.

200
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:43,740
Um...

201
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,380
What do people usually give
for a promotion celebration?

202
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,380
Hmm...

203
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:52,030
The most basic thing
would be flowers, right?

204
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,500
Flowers, huh...

205
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:00,800
(August 12, 2021)

206
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,190
You're back.

207
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,320
Please marry me.

208
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,640
What?

209
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,730
Because it's my first time
giving someone flowers.

210
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,140
I'm a little nervous.

211
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,780
Thank you.

212
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,610
Congratulations on being selected.

213
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,160
It's just an honorable mention.

214
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,410
That's still worth celebrating.

215
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:35,390
Minato should enter the competition too.

216
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,060
I'll pass.

217
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:39,090
Oh, really?

218
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,070
Ah...

219
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:46,120
How frustrating.

220
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:49,510
What's your answer?

221
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,360
Huh?

222
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:52,840
The answer to marrying me.

223
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,080
I'll think about it.

224
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,190
Please marry me.

225
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,010
Uh...

226
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,520
This is my gift to you for your promotion.

227
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:55,030
Thank you.

228
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,169
I was imitating you, don't you remember?

229
00:15:58,170 --> 00:15:59,170
I remember.

230
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,320
Oh, you do.

231
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:02,990
The flowers are the same too.

232
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,660
Eustoma.

233
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:06,570
Right? This is it, isn't it?

234
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,410
I knew it.

235
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:10,270
When I saw it at the flower shop...

236
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:13,040
I felt like this was the
one from my memory.

237
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:16,630
Can this be your answer?

238
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:19,370
Huh?

239
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:22,760
Wataru, didn't you say 'I'll
think about it' back then?

240
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,320
Ah.

241
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:26,270
I did say that...

242
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:30,470
Eh~

243
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:35,200
Reporting a miracle,
everyone's here on time!

244
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:36,606
Aren't you usually the
one who's late the most?

245
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:37,860
No way~

246
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,680
I'm hungry.

247
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,800
Let's go.

248
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:42,010
Let's go, let's go!

249
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:45,830
Minato, it's been too long, hasn't it?
How have you been lately?

250
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:46,570
Good.

251
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:47,670
That's great.

252
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,040
Let's go.

253
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:53,119
Come on, come on, let's have a
drink today, it's a rare occasion.

254
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,190
That's not a good look.

255
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,350
What's that about?

256
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,800
Wataru gave it to me.

257
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,169
I should have prepared something too.

258
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:01,050
It's fine.

259
00:17:01,051 --> 00:17:02,091
It was just a coincidence.

260
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,500
I just happened to pass
by a flower shop, that's all.

261
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,040
Speaking of bouquets...

262
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,840
They're usually given when you're leaving.

263
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:11,860
Just as an FYI.

264
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:13,430
Is that so?

265
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,366
Isn't it a hassle to
carry it from the start?

266
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:19,500
So, it's cooler to hand it over
smoothly when you're leaving.

267
00:17:20,235 --> 00:17:21,435
That's true...

268
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,470
Sorry, should I give it to you later?

269
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,660
No need.

270
00:17:24,661 --> 00:17:25,860
They're already mine.

271
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,950
Oh, I see.

272
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,970
By the way, how do
you know things like that?

273
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:35,220
Your girlfriend must
have corrected you, right?

274
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:36,390
Huh?

275
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,199
No... No, it's not.

276
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:38,960
No...

277
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:40,146
Well, it's not entirely not, but...

278
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:43,370
- Why do you guys always see right through me?
- It's written all over your face!

279
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,310
Alright then.

280
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:50,300
To celebrate Minato's
promotion and transfer...

281
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,560
Cheers!

282
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:54,130
Cheers~

283
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:01,690
But speaking of which...

284
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,030
Getting transferred to
headquarters is amazing, isn't it?

285
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,800
Honestly, it's super amazing.

286
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:08,920
Minato, your company
has a lot of people, right?

287
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:12,070
Just participating in an internal
competition is impressive enough.

288
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,850
Because I like yogurt.

289
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,699
Liking it is one thing...

290
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:18,140
But seriously, how did you find the time?

291
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:20,520
Just handling your regular
work must be exhausting, right?

292
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,690
After finishing regular work...

293
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,050
I finalized the project
little by little with my senior.

294
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,410
How long did it take
until it was finalized?

295
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,730
If you count from when
I first consulted him...

296
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,140
About half a year, I guess?

297
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:35,730
Spending half a year on a project
that might not even pass, huh?

298
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,580
That's so cool!

299
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:38,970
No...

300
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:40,740
That's really so cool!

301
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:42,430
I want to as well.

302
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:43,870
Hey.

303
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,550
Being able to do what you want at work...

304
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,030
That's really rare.

305
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:52,540
Wait, Fujisawa already
shook his hand, I want to too!

306
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:53,750
Forget it.

307
00:18:53,751 --> 00:18:55,700
Please let my project pass too!

308
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,446
Rubbing off some good luck,
rubbing off some good luck!

309
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,270
Don't just touch me randomly!

310
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:07,600
Wataru, do you really
understand how amazing Minato is?

311
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,760
I get it!

312
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,930
I understand him best.

313
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,540
Suspicious.

314
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:16,476
It's been suspicious ever
since you said 'finalized'.

315
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,060
I understand, okay?

316
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:22,300
Fixing the camera on a tripod to shoot
is called 'fixed-point shooting', right?

317
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:23,300
Damn it, I was too careless.

318
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,820
Winner, Wataru.

319
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:30,000
You guys really haven't changed at all.

320
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,480
Yeah, we haven't changed.

321
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,760
It's always been like this.

322
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:37,330
I feel like even when we're old
men, we'll still be hanging out like this.

323
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,800
Hey, of course!

324
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,460
The five of us will
always be like this, right?

325
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:42,980
Yeah.

326
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,310
But you know...

327
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,070
Shioiri already has a family.

328
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,590
I also started living in a
shared house recently.

329
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,200
My roommate even asked if we
should start a company together.

330
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,830
He brought that up.

331
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,566
Fujisawa, are you going
to be a company president?

332
00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:00,270
I think that might not be bad.

333
00:20:01,686 --> 00:20:02,786
But seriously...

334
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:09,230
It's about time we started thinking
about our future life plans, right?

335
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,090
It's too early! We're only 25!

336
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:16,500
You could also say
'already' 25, Wataru-kun.

337
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,040
Alright, alright, but...

338
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,066
No matter what, we'll still be
hanging out together, right?

339
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:21,610
It'll always be like this from now on.

340
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,280
Alright!

341
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:26,650
To our...

342
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,380
Great friendship!

343
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:29,970
Cheers!

344
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,270
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

345
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,980
To our great friendship!

346
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:42,130
How many times are we going to toast today?

347
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,836
At least five times, I guess.

348
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,670
No, I think it's seven.

349
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:48,030
No, no, no, I get it.

350
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,320
To put it simply...

351
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:53,310
You're just lonely, if I'm being direct.

352
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,280
- I know!
- Really?

353
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,000
- Hey, you're lonely, aren't you?
- Watch out, watch out!

354
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,010
Look ahead!

355
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:02,299
This way.

356
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,800
Then we'll go this way.

357
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,080
Oh! See you next time!

358
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:07,670
Thanks.

359
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:11,960
Thanks for today.

360
00:21:12,776 --> 00:21:14,256
And, congratulations on the marriage!

361
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:16,260
I haven't told you in person yet.

362
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:20,060
You're really amazing, you know.

363
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,300
Bye!

364
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,770
That was like a storm just now.

365
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:33,610
Everyone was just so happy to see you.

366
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,600
You too?

367
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:36,750
Of course.

368
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:45,640
I really can't imagine Minato at work.

369
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,776
Can you have proper
conversations with people?

370
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,870
I'm good at reports and
presentations, so it's fine.

371
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:53,270
Though I'm not good at small talk.

372
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,670
You only ever make small talk with me.

373
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,740
Wataru is special.

374
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,860
Minato, where are you
going back to tonight?

375
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,616
Are you going back to your
parents' house again today?

376
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,480
I started living alone in Chigasaki.

377
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,560
Huh?

378
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:09,130
Why?

379
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,400
I thought it's a bit much to still
be living at home at this point...

380
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,200
Your company is in Tokyo, right?

381
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:15,330
Isn't it far?

382
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:18,280
As long as I can get to work
without changing trains, I'm satisfied.

383
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:23,640
That's why he brought up living together.

384
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,580
Rent in Tokyo is expensive.

385
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:27,030
And the air isn't good.

386
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:28,390
I see.

387
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,670
Because I also hate being
so far from Wataru again.

388
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,760
No...

389
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:46,350
Minato is a friend.

390
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,720
Minato is a friend.

391
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:53,430
Minato is...

392
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:02,306
(Next Episode Preview)
Wataru, you have something on your face.

393
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:03,330
Is it gone?

394
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:06,279
Is it impossible for things
to stay the same forever...?

395
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,890
Photos are things that can convey feelings.

396
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,180
But still, no.

397
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:11,510
I cherish you.

398
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,720
I know.

399
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:14,710
Because I like Minato.
