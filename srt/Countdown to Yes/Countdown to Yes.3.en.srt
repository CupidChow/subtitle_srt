00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,700
(September 13, 2025)

2
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:09,950
Bro, this is awesome!

3
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:13,390
I look pretty cool with my backpack, right?

4
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,680
You look super cool.

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:17,410
Oh, Manager!

6
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:18,496
Manager, come take a photo with us!

7
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,430
Huh? Me too?

8
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,300
You want to take my picture?

9
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:30,890
This is looking great.

10
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,160
Manager...

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,450
Get a little closer to him.

12
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:35,860
Okay.

13
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,600
- Dad.
- Yeah?

14
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:41,460
You need to fix your collar.

15
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,060
Oh, thank you.

16
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:46,280
Gakudo, you're such a good kid.

17
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,069
Dad, I'm in the senior
class now. I'm a grown-up.

18
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,020
Stop treating me like a baby.

19
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,140
Is that so?

20
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:57,900
A real grown-up, huh?

21
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,650
You've grown so much.

22
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,320
Dad, stop playing around
and take the picture!

23
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:08,570
Wataru, come join the photo.

24
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:10,380
Are you sure?

25
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:10,830
Yeah.

26
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,570
Okay, let me just... set the timer.

27
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:17,010
Alright. 9, 8, 7...

28
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:19,990
6, 5, 4...

29
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,450
3, 2...

30
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,290
1, 0!

31
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:31,960
Nice, looks good.

32
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:33,930
It turned out great, didn't it, Bro?

33
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,620
Ah.

34
00:01:35,621 --> 00:01:36,820
Hey, Wataru.

35
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,180
Look at this.

36
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,680
Wow.

37
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:40,859
That's a really good shot.

38
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:41,860
Right?

39
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:46,650
Want me to show you how
to take even better ones?

40
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,180
Actually...

41
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,130
There's a specific photo
I really want to take.

42
00:01:54,653 --> 00:01:55,653
A photo you want to take?

43
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,100
Of the person I like.

44
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,580
Someone you like?

45
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,490
Yeah, from kindergarten.

46
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,010
Ms. Megumi.

47
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,330
Then just take it. Take a picture of her.

48
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:07,530
I can't, it's too embarrassing.

49
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:08,630
If I take her picture...

50
00:02:08,631 --> 00:02:10,340
won't she find out that I like her?

51
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,240
Find out you like her?

52
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,220
Dad always says...

53
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,430
that photos are meant
to convey your feelings.

54
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,970
Convey your feelings...

55
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,220
Dad gives a name to every photo he takes.

56
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,680
It's so cool, right?

57
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,070
If I take a photo of Minato now...

58
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,290
what kind of feelings
would the name of it reveal?

59
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,150
Wataru?

60
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:52,010
I... might be too scared to take it, too.

61
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,620
Wataru, is something bothering you?

62
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,370
You can talk to me.

63
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,270
Is it about someone you like?

64
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,700
Do you have someone like that too?

65
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,030
Someone I like...

66
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,670
Because I hate the idea of
being so far from you again.

67
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:16,260
I... don't really know.

68
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
"Countdown To Yes"

69
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,900
(July 14, 2019)

70
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,800
Yeah, just like that.

71
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,800
Lean back a little more.

72
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,290
Try to blend in with the sunflowers.

73
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:21,710
Blend in?

74
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:22,810
Yeah.

75
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:25,980
Right.

76
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:27,740
A bit more.

77
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,330
Perfect, perfect.

78
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,000
(Episode 3)

79
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,330
Let me check. Hold on.

80
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:41,920
- Okay.
- How is it?

81
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,130
Do I look good?

82
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:46,259
Well... what do you think?

83
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,450
Hmm...

84
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:49,619
I still prefer being shot from the left.

85
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,190
I'm more confident from that angle. See?

86
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,929
When I took that photo
of Minato from this angle...

87
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,500
it turned out pretty well.

88
00:04:58,910 --> 00:04:59,980
Maybe it's the lighting?

89
00:05:00,983 --> 00:05:03,803
You took such a great photo of Minato.

90
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,360
Can we try over there?

91
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,930
I think I'd look better in that spot.

92
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:10,770
Oh, uh...

93
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,120
Sure, I guess.

94
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,500
So this angle isn't it, huh?

95
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,790
Wataru, let's take a break.

96
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,800
Just a second.

97
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,440
If I use this angle...

98
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,729
Wataru, when it comes to photography...

99
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,550
you get totally tunnel-visioned.

100
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,250
I can put up with it because
you're my boyfriend...

101
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,800
but if you were just
a friend, I'd be over it.

102
00:05:58,089 --> 00:06:00,169
What's that supposed to mean?
What are you saying?

103
00:06:00,531 --> 00:06:02,489
I mean, while I'm still
wearing "love goggles"...

104
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:03,920
I can forgive you.

105
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,550
Love goggles?

106
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,340
Yeah.

107
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,120
Let's take a break.

108
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,880
Sorry, are you tired?

109
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,240
Next time, we'll go wherever
you want to take photos.

110
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,930
Hmm... then I want to go to Hokkaido.

111
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,790
Hokkaido? That's a bit sudden.

112
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,070
I've never been there before.

113
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,400
Oh, I know.

114
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,350
Let's go to Hokkaido for summer vacation.

115
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:33,910
Oh...

116
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,510
About Hokkaido...
I'm sorry.

117
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:37,910
Why?

118
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,590
I already promised Minato we'd go together.

119
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:41,670
Minato again.

120
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,496
We're planning to travel across Hokkaido...

121
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,880
and take as many photos as we can.

122
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,110
We have to have Genghis
Khan BBQ, obviously.

123
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:48,230
But wait...

124
00:06:48,231 --> 00:06:49,549
Eating that right after visiting a ranch...

125
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:50,870
feels a little wrong, doesn't it?

126
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,110
Must be nice.

127
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:54,319
Fine, I'll just go with someone else.

128
00:06:54,506 --> 00:06:56,186
Oh! Maybe we'll run into each other there.

129
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,880
We won't.

130
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,636
Actually, we won't be seeing
each other at all anymore.

131
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,000
Huh?

132
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
What do you mean?

133
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:08,580
It was short, but I had fun.

134
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,100
Bye.

135
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,630
I'm home.

136
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:36,470
Hey.

137
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:38,170
Why do you look so down?

138
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,960
Can you tell?

139
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:41,670
I got dumped.

140
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,350
What are you doing?

141
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,300
Celebrating your "getting
dumped" anniversary?

142
00:08:08,563 --> 00:08:10,403
Stop looking so happy
while taking my picture.

143
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,620
Ah...

144
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:14,050
This is good.

145
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,280
Tilt your head a bit more.

146
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,380
Yeah.

147
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:25,620
Is it really that bad to eat
Genghis Khan after the ranch?

148
00:08:27,893 --> 00:08:30,013
Would it be better if we
did it the other way around?

149
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,660
It might be a little better that way.

150
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,070
I figured.

151
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:40,490
I'll never understand romance.

152
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,450
It's so easy when we're just friends...

153
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:47,410
but as soon as you're a
couple, it gets so complicated.

154
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:48,670
Why is that?

155
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:51,310
Who knows.

156
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,660
Whatever.

157
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:57,570
Being with you is the
easiest and most fun anyway.

158
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:04,670
Yeah.

159
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,170
These bean sprouts are great today.

160
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:10,250
I bought a new seasoning.

161
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:11,990
Chili powder.

162
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,710
That explains the kick.

163
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:19,590
Got a problem with that?

164
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,640
A problem?

165
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,880
It's delicious.

166
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:24,860
Good.

167
00:09:24,885 --> 00:09:25,885
Oh, right.

168
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,070
About Hokkaido...

169
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:29,870
Is a 5 AM start okay with you?

170
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,600
(August 6, 2019)

171
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,550
The Great...

172
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,360
North.

173
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:11,990
The usual cliché.

174
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,690
Let me show you how to milk a cow.

175
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:23,030
- Excuse me.
- Okay.

176
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,100
Got it?

177
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:27,830
Yeah.

178
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:29,730
Minato.

179
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:32,730
- Wataru.
- Yeah?

180
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,270
Look over here.

181
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,420
Smile.

182
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:43,670
I heard this is fresh.

183
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,150
Thanks.

184
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,870
It's unsweetened.

185
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:51,050
Can you handle it, Wataru?

186
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,640
Oh.

187
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,490
This yogurt is amazing.

188
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,300
It's so sweet even without sugar. How?

189
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,640
You're exaggerating.

190
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,640
No, really.

191
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,320
It's good.

192
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,520
Right?

193
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,530
Must be the quality of the milk.

194
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:24,470
What?

195
00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:27,180
You're like a yogurt expert now.

196
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:29,339
Wataru, you've got some on your face.

197
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,340
Huh?

198
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:32,670
Not there, a bit higher.

199
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,460
Here?

200
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:35,840
No, here.

201
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:40,860
Did I get it?

202
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:43,590
Yeah.

203
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:58,030
Don't waste the film on me.

204
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,570
I'm almost out anyway.

205
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,170
Since we took so many...

206
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:07,250
why don't we have a
private photo exhibition?

207
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,280
Just for the two of us?

208
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,320
Yeah.

209
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,160
We can decorate the room with these photos.

210
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,760
And we'll be the only audience.

211
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,050
What? You don't want to?

212
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:17,690
I do.

213
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:18,990
Ah.

214
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,170
Then we'd better take a lot more.

215
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,160
Minato, hurry up!

216
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:31,570
Wait for me.

217
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,200
What's with that face?

218
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,380
Hello.

219
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,080
Excuse us.

220
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,140
Don't be scared.

221
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,250
Welcome.

222
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:55,700
Wataru.

223
00:12:58,610 --> 00:12:59,610
Minato.

224
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:09,380
Are you going to take it?

225
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:11,156
Wataru, you're shaking.

226
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,260
I am not.

227
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:13,650
You totally are.

228
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:23,720
Minato, you're really good at making these.

229
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,830
Wataru, your fox is...

230
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,510
unique.

231
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:35,290
That's the point. It's more relatable.

232
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:39,690
It kind of looks like you. It's cute.

233
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,490
Really?

234
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:44,910
I look like this?

235
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,250
Oh!

237
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,440
- Moo.
- Moo.

238
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:58,730
Oh, sheep!

239
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,270
Whoa.

240
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:02,440
It's all... butts.

241
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:04,160
Just a bunch of butts?

242
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:08,790
- So many butts.
- Look at all those butts.

243
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:11,900
Hey.

244
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:12,970
This is a great photo.

245
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:15,150
The composition is perfect.

246
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,220
And the one of you
milking the cow in Otaru...

247
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:20,070
is really well done.

248
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:22,960
Yeah, it's a great shot.

249
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:34,080
Did I... really look that
dorky feeding the sheep?

250
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:36,920
Super dorky.

251
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,270
Why didn't you say anything?

252
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:39,570
It's a masterpiece.

253
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,220
Ugh.

254
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,600
Oh.

255
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:43,870
This one's out of focus.

256
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,440
That's okay. It looks good that way.

257
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:49,230
You mean it has "character"?

258
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,640
Exactly.

259
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:52,900
Oh.

260
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:53,600
Hmm?

261
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
The birth of the calf.

262
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,259
This photo is incredible.

263
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,420
It's truly a beautiful photo.

264
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:01,010
Oh, stop.

265
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:03,340
No, it really is.

266
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:05,450
Well, thanks. I'm glad you like it.

267
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:06,910
Thank you.

268
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,270
Thanks.

270
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,080
Good job today.

271
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,840
Good job.

272
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:28,210
I'll leave this to you.

273
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:29,860
Yokoi.

274
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,076
Make sure to increase the concentration.

275
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,160
Got it.

(September 13, 2025)

278
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,440
What's up?

279
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:57,730
Why are you spacing out?

280
00:15:59,723 --> 00:16:01,383
Are you tired?

281
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,250
Yeah.

282
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:06,980
I think I've hit a wall.

283
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,420
I feel like...

284
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,140
I can't take photos like I used to.

285
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:14,990
Hmm?

286
00:16:15,303 --> 00:16:16,583
You mean your style?

287
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,320
I guess.

288
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,660
Something like that.

289
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:23,830
I see.

290
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:26,060
A slump, huh?

291
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:28,430
But...

292
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,240
it doesn't have to be
"like it used to be," right?

293
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:35,340
But that's what I want.

294
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,240
Just like before...

295
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,130
That was the best, the
happiest time for me.

296
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:44,820
Is that so?

297
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,670
Staying the same forever...

298
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,160
Is that impossible?

299
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:52,860
Well...

300
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:58,150
People always tell me my style has changed.

301
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:01,930
So I'm not really the one to ask.

302
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:07,870
It's because I'm scared.

308
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:47,570
Sorry.

309
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,560
Developing the photos
took longer than I thought.

310
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:53,500
They just mentioned "Postcard
King, Eldest Son's Breeze."

311
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:55,450

313
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,800
is...

315
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,220
Sorry, Wataru.

316
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:13,980
Overtime ran long.

317
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:16,970
Overtime, huh?

318
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:18,770
Hmm?

319
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,800
What's wrong?

320
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,800
Nothing.

321
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,880
Just thinking you've
really become an adult.

322
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,640
Huh?

323
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:35,810
No listening?

324
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:38,690
Oh...

325
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,460
Sure.

327
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,900
It's been a while since
you listened to this, right?

328
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,380
I've been listening all along.

329
00:18:54,736 --> 00:18:55,116
Really?

330
00:18:55,351 --> 00:18:57,280
Even when I was in Hokkaido.

331
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,970
I'm a loyal listener.

332
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,300
I can't.

333
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:15,090
Huh?

334
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,680
What?

335
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:18,310
Oh.

336
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:19,770
Nothing, it's nothing.

00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:40,560
Back in college...

340
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:43,850
didn't we use to walk
home like this all the time?

341
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,840
Yeah.

342
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,660
Wataru, you're buying the juice.

343
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:57,729
Why is it that since high school...

344
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:58,890
I'm always the one paying?

345
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:00,820
Because you always fall off.

346
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:02,630
One more time.

347
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,320
Don't fall off this time.

348
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:23,850
No, no, no! Ah!

349
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,110
Hey!

350
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:40,280
Wataru.

351
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:41,930
What?

352
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:43,499
We should really just live together.

353
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,180
No.

354
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,180
That was fast.

355
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,450
I'm not living with you again.

356
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,119
Why not?

357
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,120
Just because.

358
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:54,980
Didn't you have fun today...
walking together like we used to?

359
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,050
Just like in college.

360
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:59,090
I want to eat your burnt
bean sprouts again.

361
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:01,320
I'm an adult now.

362
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:02,740
I don't do that anymore.

363
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:04,130
Then as an adult, Wataru...

364
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,220
let's live together.

365
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,590
How does it even lead to that?

366
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,450
I just want it to be like college again.

367
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:11,940
Stop talking about college.

368
00:21:12,293 --> 00:21:14,853
You were the first one to leave
our student days behind, Minato.

369
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:18,210
Wataru, are you mad?

370
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,270
Because you gave up photography...

371
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,679
and joined a company
that has nothing to do with it.

372
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,720
Then you just disappeared.

373
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,569
And now you suddenly show up...

374
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:28,800
and ask to move in?

375
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,230
I didn't give up on photography.

376
00:21:34,243 --> 00:21:36,283
My way of doing it might
be different from yours...

377
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:37,710
but I still cherish it.

378
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:38,820
I know.

379
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,120
Wataru?

380
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,230
Sorry.

381
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,870
I'm not mad at you.

382
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,120
I'm mad at myself.

383
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:03,310
Why?

384
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,850
Because after you left...

385
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:07,670
I wouldn't admit how lonely I was.

386
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:11,050
I'm mad at myself for being such an idiot.

387
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,230
What's with that face?

388
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,380
Me too.

389
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,560
After we were apart...

390
00:22:25,561 --> 00:22:27,310
I realized how much that time meant to me.

391
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,080
If you feel the same way, Wataru...

392
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,080
then let's start over.

393
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:35,570
I...

394
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:37,410
don't really have a reason to leave home.

395
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:39,160
You could eat with me every day.

396
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:40,350
I can't afford rent.

397
00:22:40,351 --> 00:22:41,779
You don't have to pay.
Let's just live together.

398
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,249
If we're living together,
of course I'm paying rent.

399
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:44,586
Fine, then pay rent
and let's live together.

400
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:47,420
Look... the answer is just no.

401
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,180
But why?

402
00:22:51,629 --> 00:22:52,859
Because I'm in love with you.

403
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,110
(Next Episode)
Wait!

404
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:01,700
Time out!

405
00:23:02,213 --> 00:23:05,063
Isn't a one-of-a-kind best friend
more important than a lover?

406
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,789
I feel like that's something
we wouldn't understand.

407
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:08,430
A time that belongs only to them.

408
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,410
Just like we used to have.

409
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,700
What Minato and I had "back then"...

410
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,070
what was it really like?
