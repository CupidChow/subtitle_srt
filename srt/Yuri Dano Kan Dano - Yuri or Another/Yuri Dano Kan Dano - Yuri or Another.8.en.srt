1
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:06,840
Do you mean her stalker was a professor from her class?

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,380
I'm accepting his anger and sorrow in Yuri's stead.

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,360
You weren't kidding about being whipped.

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,660
Please stop the relationship with Kairi.

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,160
I don't want you to betray your wife.

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,040
Can it be me instead?

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,590
It was thriiling to hear that.

8
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:26,500
Because that's enternal true love.

9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,690
If you hurt Yuri,

10
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:29,190
- I'll report it to the police. 
 - You won't.

11
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:31,860
Because you deeply care about your friend.

12
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,170
- Fetish? 
 - Fetishism.

13
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,910
Originally, the word referred to a religious practice such as making a wish on a seashell.

14
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:43,960
In the modern world, fetishism means

15
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,200
rather than a personal taste, it's obsessive devotion.

16
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,320
Or sexual fetishism is a sexual fixation on a particular body part.

17
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,300
Some people have an eyeglasses fetish or a voice fetish.

18
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:56,020
The sexy male voices are popular, even if their faces are ugly.

19
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:59,600
Men are crazy over those cute voices.

20
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,040
What is my fetish?

21
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,410
I guess I have a muscle fetish... in a manner of speaking.

22
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:06,730
Well, that's typical.

23
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:08,950
A fetish for legs, hands,

24
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:12,610
scents, collarbones, and nape of the neck.

25
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:14,250
Specific body parts?

26
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,370
Adam's apple? Since women don't have it.

27
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:19,330
Some cross the boundaries and become pervs.

28
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:23,270
And commit a crime and get arrested for it.

29
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:26,640
Like underwear bandits and men who are sexually attracted to minors.

30
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,040
Gross. I could never understand that.

31
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,430
Some women are attracted to young boys.

32
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:34,390
Men get excited through visual stimulation,

33
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:37,450
so they are obsessed with various things.

34
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:38,920
A pantyhose fetish,

35
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,380
and a thigh fetish.

36
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,150
Taking photos using a hidden camera.

37
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,470
Pantyhose? What on earth?

38
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:48,100
It's a desire to break down a sheld of a carrier woman.

39
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,630
Some have a breast milk fetish.

40
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:53,140
There are porn videos about fetishes.

41
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:56,390
Men are overly aroused by breast milk.

42
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:59,510
So weird. Some people have very odd fetishes.

43
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:03,570
After telling your fetish to your partner,

44
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:06,640
sex becomes more exciting.

45
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,850
I think people should keep it to themselves.

46
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:12,310
It's such a turn-off for some people.

47
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:15,010
A person who is turned off by trifles, it's because of a lack of love.

48
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,400
Lacking is better than having too much.

49
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,090
Oh, I just heard the voice of your heart.

50
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:20,720
That's right.

51
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,830
If you pursue deeper love, you'd end up wandering around hell.

52
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:27,040
You'd say "This isn't love. This love isn't real."

53
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,450
Is self-harm also a sort of fetishism?

54
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,630
It could be. A scar fetish or I should say...

55
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:36,560
It's like narcissism from victimizing themselves as a poor injured bird.

56
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:39,280
Cissism? 
 (T/N: Shizumu means sink or go down in Japanese)

57
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,040
Fetish and narcissisｍ, both are to sink into a swamp. 
 (T/N: It means being absorbed and unable to escape.)

58
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,920
Scary!

59
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,880
By the way, what is your fetish?

60
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,240
With men? Or women?

61
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,470
Do you have a different fetish for each gender?

62
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,000
I don't discriminate against gender.

63
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,700
That's not what I'm asking.

64
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,330
I have it, but it's not a big deal.

65
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,840
So... what is it?

66
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:03,030
My birthday is coming soon.

67
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:06,010
I know. What kind of present do you want?

68
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:08,890
If you can satisfy my fetish, I don't need anything else.

69
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:11,990
A cosplay? A Santa Claus costume?

70
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:13,710
Fine. I'll wear whatever you wish me to.

71
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,830
Not cosplay, but be naked.

72
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:18,610
- Again? No way! 
 - Show your side a little.

73
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:21,120
- My side? 
 - Your armpit.

74
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,460
That's easy. I can show it to you right now.

75
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,890
The armpits show a little unshaved hair.

76
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:29,880
I want to smell and lick your armpit.

77
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,680
Pervert. What are you saying?

78
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,940
Licking? Are you a dog?

79
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:33,890
Bow-wow.

80
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:35,740
I must've been a dog in my previous life.

81
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:38,900
I thought you were a cat that likes to bite.

82
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,460
Please. Aren't we besties?

83
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,910
No!

84
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,500
[Yuri or Another]

85
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,530
[Final Episode]

86
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:00,760
I kinda understand the fetish for scents.

87
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,890
There was a senior in my high school who I had a crush on.

88
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:06,090
When I got closer to him, he stunk a little.

89
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:09,270
Right. There are a few men that I can't stand the smell of.

90
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,230
Regardless of how he looks.

91
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:14,290
That's because of something called HLA genes.

92
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:19,790
Women are instinctively attracted to the body odor completely different from their own.

93
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,610
In order to produce offspring of the strongest gene.

94
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:26,900
The reason why I think my dad stinks is to avoid incest.

95
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,220
A stronger gene will be born

96
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,840
by mixing dissimilar genes.

97
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,840
When a male and a female are attracted to each other,

98
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,820
it's based on their biological compatibility.

99
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,980
It's nothing dramatic about that.

100
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:42,340
Then, how do you explain same-sex attraction?

101
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,220
Gays and lesbians.

102
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,810
Are you referring to me and Kairi? I mean...

103
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:49,750
we're not sexually attracted to each other.

104
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,900
But you're wearing the friendship ring again.

105
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,070
I saw that.

106
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,520
Taking it off and wearing it again.

107
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,050
it's similar to a relationship between a man and a woman.

108
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:58,340
You're wrong. We're friends.

109
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,330
I know!

110
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:01,490
Friendship is a mysterious bond

111
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:04,900
beyond genetic matchmaking and greater than love.

112
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,710
A thumb is more important

113
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:10,230
between a thumb and a ring finger.

114
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:13,210
That's insanely rough logic but makes sense.

115
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:16,790
Even a mafia wouldn't dare cut off a thumb.

116
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:20,570
The high divorce rate is also due to genetic matchmaking.

117
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,600
It means they weren't deeply in love.

118
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,700
When the magic is gone after having a child,

119
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,850
say goodbye to each other.

120
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,680
A relationship between a man and a woman is fleeting.

121
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,530
I can't watch romantic dramas anymore

122
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:35,690
when I think a stupid couple

123
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:38,220
who was determined by genetic matchmaking.

124
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,610
So true.

125
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,370
Hey, stupid couple.

126
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:48,000
I heard you got back together with Yuri.

127
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,150
Yes. Thanks to you.

128
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,380
I think it's great.

129
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:54,160
A stupid couple like you guys are giving a positive influence on the world.

130
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,480
What is that supposed to mean?

131
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,940
By the way, it's about Yuri's stalker.

132
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,620
It's fine since she moved to a new place.

133
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,440
Didn't you hear that he sent her sex toys?

134
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,710
Seriously? Does he know her new apartment?

135
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:10,230
- Go to the police. 
 - Protect Yuri

136
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:12,270
I live next door, so I can protect her at home.

137
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,850
But other places...

138
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,600
What other places?

139
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,030
Like here.

140
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,920
Here?

141
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:25,750
At the university?

142
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,820
Really? The stalker is a student here?

143
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,100
Not necessary.

144
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:37,820
Are you going to the hospital now?

145
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,350
Should I come with you?

146
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:41,610
"Don't worry anymore."

147
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,370
"You've done enough."

148
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:49,050
I feel like my wife is telling me so lately.

149
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,500
You've done enough?

150
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,390
"You must be tired."

151
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:56,520
"Don't worry about me anymore."

152
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,070
How could it be...

153
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:02,850
A story will end.

154
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,340
Every story will come to its end eventually.

155
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:13,630
Professor?

156
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,760
She isn't attending her class or answering her phone?

157
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,990
What is going on?

158
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:37,180
I warned you to keep an eye on her, didn't I?

159
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,650
I didn't think she would disappear suddenly.

160
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:43,170
Find her. Search the entire campus if you have to.

161
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,800
The campus is too vast. I don't even know the face of the stalker.

162
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,390
It's someone who is closer to her and trusted by her.

163
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,260
What?

164
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,330

Yes, I don't want her to know, but

167
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:06,260
it's a different story when Yuri is in danger.

Before that?

He will.

Those who have lived life in despair, do not hesitate.

173

The stalker is the professor.

What?

It's not nice of you to call me a stalker.

214
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:47,860
True love and stalking is a fine line.

215
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,820
In a sense of the depth of love.

216

from exhaustion of nursing his wife and loneliness.

223

He started to think why is this happening to him.

224

On the other hand, people praised him

227

I also called it eternal love.

228

That's why he targeted you.

229

Sonezaki and Yokohama.

234

Both places are related to double suicide.

She would.

254
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:51,570
Because she's desperate as you are.

255

Kairi, did you know Professor was the stalker?

258
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:23,740
I asked him to vent his frustrations on me.

259
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,910
Why did you do that?

260
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:32,820
I see. You thought I'd be devestated.

261
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,700
Because it proves that there is no such thing as eternal love.

262
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,040
It was only a play,

263
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,820
so it wasn't enough stimulation for him.

A firefighter went into a burning apartment.

00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:10,780
A mother screamed outside that her child was still inside the building.

293
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:13,210
The firefighter managed to find the child quickly, but

294
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:18,950
the firefighter said he couldn't find the child via walkie-talkie till the very end.

295
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:22,550
Because he saw the child had wounds from physical abuse.

296
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:26,920
By putting her in a mentally tight spot and he tried to make her turn a new leaf.

297
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:30,980
Because she would realize what's important only after she loses.

298

Exactly. Are you going to report him to the police?

00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:51,610
♫ malted my body and heart ♫

333
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:56,030
I thought you were the queen and whipped him.

334
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:59,290
I told you I don't mind being either way.

335
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:01,240
Right.

336
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:06,680
Listen, you should never do that again.

337
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:13,770
You heard me say "Shut up, old jerk!" didn't you?

338
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:16,080
I heard it. Are you a former gang member?

339
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,600
As you can see, I'm not a weakling.

340
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:21,750
Okay.

341
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:25,230
Of course, it was shocking to find out the truth.

342
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:27,790
But I wouldn't be dishearted by the trifles.

343
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:31,360
I was happy that you protected me,

344
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,900
but you can't get hurt because of me.

345
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,210
Was I too nosey?

346
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:41,000
No, I didn't say that.

347
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,730
Thank you.

348
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:46,390
Sure.

349
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:51,990
I will protect you if something happens to you.

350
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:54,050
Will you?

351
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:56,330
I swear on the ring.

352
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:59,430
On the ring.

353
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:05,080
By the way, my birthday is almost over.

354
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:09,710
Sorry.  I didn't have time to go shopping because a lot happened today.

355
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:11,670
I told you I'm not interested in items.

356
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:14,940
Oh, I remember now.

357
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:17,500
Come on. Take your cardigan off.

358
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,350
Now, put your hand up high.

359
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:21,000
- Okay. 
 - Good.

360
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:23,070
Do you have any unshaved hair left?

361
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:24,080
None.

362
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,900
I guess that will do.

363
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,120
This is all I got.

364
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:32,670
- This is kinda...
 - It stinks.

365
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:34,400
- Seriously? 
 - Kidding.

366
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,790
- Hey... 
 - I'll lick it.

367
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:40,430
I love the close-up look on the pores.

368
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:44,380
Only for a second, okay? You crazy perv.

369
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:48,880
Ugh, it tickles.

370
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,170
What comes after enduring the tickle?

371
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:53,130
Don't you think we're weird?

372
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:54,830
Weird is the best...

373
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,570
- Compliment? 
 - Yes!

374
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:58,610
Enough already.

375
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,390
Now, what can I do for your birthday, Yuri?

376
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:05,610
Why do you sound so serious suddenly?

377
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:09,180
I should return a favor to Miyake before your birthday.

378
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,940
So you are dating him after all.

379
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,540
I haven't let him touch me yet.

380
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:14,820
Do you want to gift yourself for his birthday?

381
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,420
Nice. Would you like to join us?

382
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,490
- Huh? 
 - The more the merrier.

383
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:21,790
That's not fun at all. That's just...

384
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:23,700
- Three... 
 - Some!

385
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:28,820
- Yuri... 
 - No, no.

386
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:37,680
Subtitles and Timing brought to you by 💋 The Girl Next Door 💋 Team.

387
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,010
We'll be forever...

388
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:42,440
Best friends.

389
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,760
I swear on the rings.

390
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,250
I swear on the rings.

391
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:53,530
