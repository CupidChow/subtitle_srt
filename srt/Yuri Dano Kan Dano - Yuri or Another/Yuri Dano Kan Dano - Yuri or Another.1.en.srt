A stalker?

7
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:05,430
The police wouldn't move for that kind of stuff, would they?

8
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,340
Is there any apartment I can move into right away?

9
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:10,070

We have another applicant, but I will try to let you in.

Can you do that? But the rent is a little...

23
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:54,520
I will negotiate with the owner.

24

He favors me.

Okay.

He's a nasty old man, who pretends to have gone senile.

I guess he likes young girls.

Kairi? You used to be a junior idol, right?

No way. I can't believe it!

Hmm... I'm being suffocated.

- Your skin is fair and the firmness is perfect.
- Firmness?

47
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:17,060
With such a body, it's understandable someone is stalking you.

48

You look delicious.

It's scary because I don't know who he is.

It's popular overseas, so we wanted to do the same.

I don't need a boyfriend, but I have best friends.

You can't share drinks with the others, huh?

00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,590
Drinking in one go...

169
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:32,230
She was thirsty, I guess.

170
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:39,990
I have to go to work.

171
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:42,900
Then, good work.

172
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,660
Thank you so much for helping.

173
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,540
No problem.

174
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:49,000
Bye!

175
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,750
See you!

176
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,210
She's funny.

177
00:09:56,210 --> 00:10:00,050
She is outspoken despite her looks. It surprised me.

178
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,950
Right?

179
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:07,490
[Seisen Gakuin University]

180
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:10,120
So you still don't know who the stalker is?

181
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,800
No.

182
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,720
It could be him?

183
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,810
Him?

184
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:15,690
He is super nerdy.

185
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:16,920
Or it could be him.

186
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,710
Stop it. I'm seriously terrified by this.

187
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:23,020
You're coughing a lot. Don't give me your cold.

188
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:26,580
I know. I should ask someone to answer the roll call for me.

189
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,120
Hey, look.

190
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,840
If you don't stop, I will get really upset.

191
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,590
Not a stalker. Look.

192
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,860
Is the angle good for you?

193
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:33,740
Wait. I'm not ready yet.

194
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,270
You look great.

195
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:37,730
Shuji?

196
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:39,370
What is he doing?

197
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,700
He pisses me off.

198
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,690
- It looks great. 
 - Are you ready?

199
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:51,490
I'm ready. Wait for your turn to take a photo.

200
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:57,020
Wait... Well...

201
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:00,490
I was just taking pictures. That's all.

202
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:02,490
I have to cherish my fans, you know?

203
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:05,790
Fans, my ass. You were a fat bastard a year ago.

204
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:09,390
Thanks to the exercise the dietary menu you'd suggested.

205
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:12,010
Losing 20kg doesn't mean you can flirt with just anyone.

206
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:15,260
If I could win the Junon Boy Contest, I'd enter the entertainment business.

207
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,960
Stop dreaming and get a real job.

208
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,320
Who would dream of being an office worker?

209
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,500
I know! You're jealous, aren't you?

210
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,530
Are you afraid that I'll be snatched away by another girl when I become a star?

211
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:29,030
There are tons of pretty girls out there.

212
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:32,440
What is wrong with you? You didn't even help with my move.

213
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,590
Aren't you even concerned when your girlfriend has been stalked by someone?

214
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,760
It could be your ex.

215
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,870
He wants revenge because his girlfriend was taken away by this handsome guy.

216
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:48,660
Cut the crap. A year ago, you were fat and ugly.

217
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,290
I know his feeling since I was a fat nerd myself once.

218
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:52,760
It's only a minor harassment.

219
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,540
There are only a few nerds who have the guts to expose themselves to danger.

220
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,060
Just like molesters...

221
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,640
They''ll sulk easily after a good scolding.

222
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,540
It's easy for you to say.

223
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:04,120
What if I get stabbed in the dark?

224
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,040
No way.

225
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,790
By the way, the final content of Junon will be an online event.

226
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:12,110
Please, help me to win this.

227
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:14,850
Why would I pay money for you?

228
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,720
Should I stab you instead?

229
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,880
Napolitan is ready.

230
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,160
Okay.

231
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:30,910
Jeez, I might have caught a cold from Shiho.

232
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:33,400
Thank you for waiting. Here is your Napolitan.

233
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:37,160
Did you just cough on my food?

234
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:42,490
- I'm sorry. Let me get you a new one. 
 - Wait. It's fine.

235
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,610
Is he the stalker?

236
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:08,120
It's horrible. I feel like I'm coming down with a cold.

237
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,330
Don't tell me... someone is following me.

238
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:01,030
I must be over-thinking.

239
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:08,470
Cooperate with me, automatic lock.

240
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:21,780
You too, Tomomi? I feel horrible.

241
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:24,220
It must be the flu.

242
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,460
Later.

243
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:39,350
I have a fever. 39 degrees Celsius.

244
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,770
You've got to be kidding me.

245
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:03,530
Go away, NHK. I don't even watch it.
(T/N: NHK is a Japanese broadcasting company)

246
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:13,410
You don't give up, do you, NHK?

247
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:18,830
Ugh, seriously...

248
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:30,760
Here I go.

249
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,910
Who is it?

250
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:43,130
No way... How?

251
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:48,480
Chain...

252
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,870
Are you awake? Are you feeling okay?

253
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:59,680
Kairi?

254
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,250
You're soaked in sweat.

255
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,530
Let's change your pajamas.

256
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:04,810
I can do it myself.

257
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:08,130
No, lay down.

258
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:23,280
Here.

259
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,770
Thank you.

260
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:02,360
I was an introverted and nervous child when I was young.

261
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:06,000
But during a swimsuit shoot,

262
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,140
I wasn't nervous because I felt like I could be a different person.

263
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,700
Hey, do you remember?

264
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:16,610
What?

265
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:19,360
When I peed my pants in the classroom,

266
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:24,810
you took off your panties and lent them to me.

267
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:28,120
That's because I was wearing panties.

268
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,020
It was so kind of you.

269
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:34,830
I was grateful but I didn't have the chance to thank you.

270
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:37,500
I transferred to a different school without thanking you.

271
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,660
Really?

272
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,950
I really wanted to become your bestie.

273
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:45,640
Did you?

274
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:55,510
Your strawberry print panties.

275
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:58,110
I washed them and still have them.

276
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,740
For real?

277
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,380
It's my treasure.

278
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,130
Treasure...

279
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,900
Sorry. You should sleep now.

280
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,050
Okay.

281
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,510
[Please eat when you have an appetite, Kairi]

282
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,590
Yum.

283
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:32,840
Bestie, huh?

284
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:48,920
In the previous lecture, we watched the film "Voir la Mer"

285
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:52,230
that was directed by Patrice Leconte.

286
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:54,700
We discussed the characters in the film.

287
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:57,170
I wonder how Professor Kuriyama is doing right now?

288
00:20:57,170 --> 00:21:01,850
I heard he eloped with a student named Mari who is a year older than us.

289
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:05,080
He was devastated after his wife committed suicide.

290
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,470
That's what the rumor said.

291
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:10,330
I was a fan of the professor.

292
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:13,600
The remaining professor that is dandy is...

293
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,040
I can only think of Professor Fuwa.

294
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,990
How charming.

295
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:23,820
He was mentally immature and stubborn.

296
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:27,970
Maybe he is not the type that you want to be friends with.

297
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,000
She arrived. Here.

298
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,890
Didn't you get in trouble for entering without permission?

299
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:36,400
- Nobody asked for your student ID?
- Not at all.

300
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,870
I'm friends with people from other universities.

301
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:43,810
How envious. I've wanted to experience campus life myself.

302
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:46,340
I'm glad that at least I got to see that today.

303
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,970
A realtor doesn't get a day off on weekends, right?

304
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:51,430
That's right.

305
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:53,710
Ta-da!

306
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:58,140
- What is it? 
 - Open it!

307
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,750
Okay.

308
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:08,040
- Friendship ring? 
 - To thank you for taking care of me.

309
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,980
Really?

310
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:14,130
Good for you. Now we have matching rings.

311
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:17,550
I mean, that's what friends are for.

312
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:20,540
Offering help for a friend in need.

313
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,810
Giving a cold and making fun of my stalker.

314
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:24,940
You two, take the ring off.

315
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,570
Calm down.

316
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:29,000
Don't mention that right now.

317
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,620
- Right? 
 - That's right.

318
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,430
Oh, right. Did you drink champagne?

319
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:35,070
Let's have a housewarming party.

320
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:36,770
Yeah, sounds good.

321
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:39,700
I want to pour it into Yuri's clavipectoral triangle and drink it.

322
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,060
Me too. Wait.

323
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:46,030
You won't let me drink it from your pubis, will you?

324
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:48,780
Do you know the "seaweed liquor"?

325
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:53,340
- The pubic hair waves in the liquor. 
 - Waves?

326
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,330
Kairi, you're funny.

327
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:59,600
Your remarks don't match your appearance.

328
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,180
- Not again 
 - Huh?

329
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:12,320
He really pisses me off.

330
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,710
What are you doing?

331
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:17,990
Well... thank you!

332
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:19,150
Who is he?

333
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:22,820
It's Shuji, Yuri's flirtatious boyfriend.

334
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:26,950
I see. So she has a boyfriend.

335
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,380
By the way, Yuri has such a nice body.

336
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,120
She said she wants to lose weight.

337
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,260
Her boyfriend became hot after losing weight.

338
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:39,050
I like her current body.

339
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,550
- Her butt looks so delicious! 
 - What?

340
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:45,250
I bet she has beautiful butt dimples.

341
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:53,520
What's wrong?

342
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,520
I feel like someone is watching me.

343
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,920
You're mistaking. They're watching me, the Junon Boy.

344
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,980
Idiot.

345
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:10,470
The ring fits me perfectly.

346
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:13,000
Who is that beauty?

347
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,460
My friend from elementary school.

348
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:18,390
Huh? Really? But she isn't a student from our school.

349
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,590
Right. She is working now.

350
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:22,940
- Introduce me. 
 - Huh?

351
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:25,440
I mean. I'll ask her to root for me.

352
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,590
Absolutely not.

353
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:45,970

00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:35,350
♫ "I want more excitement” ♫

361
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:42,470
♫ You have disappeared somewhere ♫

362
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:49,000
♫ This room without you ♫

363

♫ I feel like my chest is about to collapse ♫

[Preview] 
 - Ta-da! 
 - Is this mine?

365
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,930
Sometimes I put it over my head and smell it.

366
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:01,650
I am a pervert.

367
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:05,370
- That's gross. 
 - It will be tramatized for sure.

368
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:10,770
To be honest, I think my sexual orientation is intricate.
