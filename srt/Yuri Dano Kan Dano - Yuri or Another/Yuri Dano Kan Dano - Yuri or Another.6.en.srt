1
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,260
It was you, wasn't it? The perpetrator.

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,100
Sending sex toys and watching from afar wasn't enough, you hurt her physically.

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,180
I crashed into her with a bicycle.

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,070
You can vent your anger on me.

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,260
You can do to me whatever you like.

6
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,720
Because I'm her bestie.

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,360
Can you help her out?

8
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,390
You care a lot about your friend.

9
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:27,610
We're besties.

10
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:36,000
Sorry for the wait.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,240
An aroma candle?

12
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,800
Wine too?  How fancy!

13
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,340
Okay.

14
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:53,800
Subtitles and Timing brought to you by 💋 The Girl Next Door 💋 Team.

15
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,700
Cheers!

16
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,960
Did you have dinner?

17
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,320
I don't eat at night.

18
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,910
Are you on a diet? You don't need to.

19
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:10,860
As for me, meat (fat) shows up immediately after eating.

20
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,320
It may sound dirty, but "meat" has a different meaning to it.

21
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,470
Why dirty?

22
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:20,720
Some people called poop "meat" in the other world.

23
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,970
You mean the dark side?

24
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:26,850
It's called scatology. Some like to eat faces.

25
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,520
Gross. I can never do that.

26
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,960
It's a personal preference and taste.

27
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,380
Urine is called "golden water."

28
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36,790
Some customers love it and drink it with a gulping sound.

29
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:38,670
Customers?

30
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,920
I worked part-time at an S&M club before.

31
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,070
Seriously?

32
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,050
Since my sexuality is all messed up,

33
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:48,350
I thought I should go to extremes.

34
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:49,950
Don't do that, Kairi.

35
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,830
You say that, but you seem interested.

36
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:56,680
Well,  out of curiosity.

37
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,710
S and M.

38
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:01,830
People say "extreme sadist" and "extreme masochist" casually these days.

39
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,500
Do you know the origin of the word sadist?

40
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,370
Did it come from a person's name "Sade"?

41
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:09,470
It's Marquis de Sade. He was arrested for having anal sex.

42
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:12,090
It's very common in modern society.

43
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,430
It's definitely not common for me.

44
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:18,030
Marquis de Sade spent most of his life in prisons and mental hospitals.

45
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,420
He wrote many books.

46
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,980
How about the M? Maso? Masochism?

47
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,500
It's originated from a writer named Sacher Masoch.

48
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,660
I guess most writers are perverts somewhat.

49
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,660
I have his book called "Venus in Furs" somewhere.

50
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,830
Should I rent it to you?

51
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:36,960
Maybe for my future reference.

52
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,500
Candlelight brings back memories.

53
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,860
Seeing candlelight makes me feel at ease.

54
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:54,060
A candle isn't for watching but for pouring on the body.

55
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,810
What?

56
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:58,010
Let me see your hand. It's not as hot as you think.

57
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:59,790
Stop it. I'm sure it hot.

58
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:02,460
How could you smile?

59
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:06,710
Watching the candlelight with you, makes me excited.

60
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,800
Huh? Do you see me as a masochist?

61
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,340
Most women are masochists.

62
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,350
Rarely, there is a woman who is both.

63
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:13,450
And you, Kairi?

64
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:16,230
That's right. I enjoy both.

65
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,470
I even keep a whip as a memento.

66
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,550
Should I bring it?

67
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:25,110
I was only joking.

68
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,400
I'm sorry for spilling.

69
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:32,180
You stupid pig.

70
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,870
What?

71
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,940
You filthy pig.

72
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:39,930
Take your panties off and show me your ass.

73
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,430
Yes...

74
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,760
My Queen.

75

00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,970
[Episode 6]

77
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:00,150
This time is S&M play?

78
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,540
Has she really worked at a club?

79
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:04,820
My Queen, bondage, and a whip and all that?

80
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:08,390
I didn't know that sort of club really does exist.

81
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:11,530
I hear a man who wants to be beaten with a whip,

82
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,100
is unexpectedly capable at work

83
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,980
and the type to harass his subordinates.

84
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,680
That's right. Someone like an elite scholar

85
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,380
could be an extreme masochist in real life.

86
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,360
It's hard to tell a personal preference

87
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,900
until I see it in person.

88
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,620
Some people like crossdressing.

89
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,880
Not many women are sadists.

90
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:36,140
Exactly. Women's bodies are adequate for the purpose of receiving.

91
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:40,470
When she called me "You filthy pig," it gave me a chill.

92
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,260
She is a pro at this.

93
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,910
It's a signature phrase of a pro.

94
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:49,780
I can't endure the pain of candle wax.

95
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:58,390
Queen adjusts the level of torture depending on an opponent.

96
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:01,360
That's the most important intuition for a sadist.

97
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,450
The red wax spreads gradually on the skin.

98
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:07,500
It hurts but you also feel an embrace of warmth.

99
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,270
You'd hope the pain and the embrace

100
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,200
would continue as long as possible.

101
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,880
"Show me your ass!"

102
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,130
While you're waiting and trembling,

103
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:19,430
you await with anticipation, then your crotch twitches.

104
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:22,310
Wait a second. Your story sounds too realistic.

105
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:25,430
That's right. As if you want to experience it once.

106
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:29,160
Of course not. I hate torture with pain and heat.

107
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,440
Do you think it's true most women aren't sadists?

108
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,090
Right. There are many bullying in middle school.

109
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:37,060
There is group bullying on SNS.

110
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,910
Yes, I've asked her about that.

111
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:42,940
She said those women aren't sadists but just bullies.

112
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,810
So they're different from sadists?

113
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:47,750
S of sadist stands for service.

114
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,480
It requires sensitivity and talent.

115
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,730
On the other hand, a masochist enjoys what was given.

116
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:56,690
However, a talented masochist queen answers with a realistic reaction.

117
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:57,930
"Please stop!

118
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:01,480
Wait, don't stop, My Queen."

119
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:07,800
I know you're interested in unknown territory.

120
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,020
Whether it's lesbian or boy's love...

121
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,960
Yes. There are many comics about those.

122
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,730
Such things are enjoyable as long as it's harmless.

123
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:18,890
That's right. It's dangerous to step into the dark side.

124
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:20,420
What do you mean?

125
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,360
Kairi used to work on the dark side.

126
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,980
I'm afraid that you'll be dragged to the dark side.

127
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,850
As your friends, we're worried about you.

128
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:29,360
You're easy to be brainwashed.

129
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,740
What kind of nonsense is that?

130
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,770
That was in the past.

131
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:36,170
Kairi is taking an exam to be a certified real-estate broker.

132
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:38,800
It's not easy to escape from the dark side.

133
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,860
That's right. She is pretty and if she is profitable,

134
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,720
who knows when she'd be dragged in again.

135
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,680
That won't happen.

136
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,240
I hate to see you disappear in the next semester.

137
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,920
We don't want to hear a rumor of you working as a prostitute.

138
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,790
Knock it off. Kairi is a nice girl.

139
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:01,260
She had some troubles growing up.

140
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,770
And she had a few questionable jobs.

141
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:06,810
She is a new woman and working diligently now.

142
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:09,040
You two are not wearing,

143
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,080
but Kairi and I are still wearing the friendship rings.

144
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,440
If you ask me whose side I'm on?

145
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,870
I'm siding with my friend.

146
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:18,640
Too late. She's already brainwashed.

147

Don't tell me we didn't warn you.

148

- Welcome back. 
 - Hello.

153
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:51,830
I heard you used to be a junior idol.

154
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:58,270
I met your friend at a convenience store the other day.

155
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,300
Yuri?

156
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:03,780
She said your mother treated you badly and grew up in a poor environment.

157
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:08,880
She wasn't badmouthing behind your back.

158
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,570
I know.

159
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:13,180
She is not the type to badmouth others.

160
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,410
In a big city,

161
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:18,030
if there is a person who collapses on the street,

162
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:20,510
nobody cares to stop by.

163
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:24,810
Because we know there is a bad outcome when involving strangers.

164
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:27,970
It's reasonable judgment, not being cold-hearted.

00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:35,200
And she would offer her help.

167
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,610
When a person offers a seat to an elderly person on a train,

168
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:42,630
the elderly person may yell "don't treat me like an older person."

169
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:47,140
But Yuri won't stop offering her seat to others.

170
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,940
People may say she lacks a learning ability.

171
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:55,870
Her unaffected kindness drives her to do so.

172
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:01,390
She told me about you because she was worried.

173
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:03,200
Don't worry about me.

174
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,140
I became the person I am today because of my dark history.

175
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,660
Is your sexuality messed up?

176
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:10,130
But my heart isn't.

177
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:17,910
She asked me to help you out.

178
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,980
Asked you, Manager?

179
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,770
I'm divorced, but

180
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,990
I am a "referred property" after all.

181
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:27,530
Generally speaking, that is.

182
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:29,570
You don't think I am a good catch?

183
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,250
No.

184
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:36,270
By the way, are you interested in me?

185
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,800
It would be a lie if I say no.

186
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,310
The ambiguous answer is pretty annoying.

187
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:45,110
I suppose.

188
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:50,270
It's important to be honest.

189
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:51,920
What?

190
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:54,900
Yuri has taught me that.

191
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:58,970
Stupid pride or being a contrarian is useless.

192
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:01,130
If you want to be happy,

193
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:05,450
being honest is the only way to do so.

194
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:07,140
Is it?

195
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,810
Aroma festival?

196
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:29,070
Should I buy some?

197
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:33,570
A candle isn't for watching, but for pouring on the body.

198
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,810
Maybe next time.

199
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:52,700
♫ The crown of the red bird has fallen ♫

200
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,190
It's hot. I can't do this.

201
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,980
Can you accept your friend's love?

202
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,440
But something like this...

203
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,400
Your first time?

204
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:06,430
Tell me with your cute voice. Say it.

205
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:08,900
This is my first time.

206
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,900
This is my first time.

207
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,040
You filthy pig.

208
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,150
Are you willing to obey me?

209
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,660
Because we're friends.

210
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:24,980
Really? Do you believe in eternal friendship?

211
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,050
I do.

212
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:29,040
Take your panties off and show me your ass.

213
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,720
Are you ready?

214
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,250
It was a dream again.

215
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:53,150
What the heck.

216
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,810
Professor?

217
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,720
Why?

218
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,970
And his expression...

219
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,120
Morning.

220
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,440
Forget it. Just now, why...?

221
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,420
Why did you tell him?

222
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,390
Huh?

223
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,970
To Manager Miyake.

224
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:36,980
Why did you tell him about my past?

225
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:39,500
Well, that's because...

226
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,940
I met him accidentally, so...

227
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:44,560
You said he is divorced but capable of work and a good catch.

228
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,160
Why did you ask him for help?

229
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,940
Because I want you to have a normal romantic relationship and get married,

230
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,790
and be happy like ordinary people.

231
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,730
What is a normal romantic relationship?

232
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:55,530
Dating and marriage would lead you to a happy life?

233
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:58,060
Your ideal is old-fashioned and stereotypical.

234
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,530
It's a basic principle.

235
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:03,430
I'm sure you'll adore your own children.

236
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:06,050
- I'm not having a kid. 
 - What?

237
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:08,590
I'm afraid I'll be just like my mother.

238
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:12,030
The more I don't want to be like her, I feel nervous and stressed.

239
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:14,060
One day, I might explode.

240
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,390
And I'll be a shitty mother like her.

241
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:19,630
Because it runs in our genes.

242
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:22,570
Statistics show that abused children will abuse their own children.

243
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,500
But...

244
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:29,930
I love children, but I'm afraid to have my own.

245
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:34,330
So you should have a kid and we can raise the child together.

246
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:35,990
But I don't even have a husband.

247
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:40,280
Just pick one. You're going to be a single mother anyway.

248
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,950
Don't worry. I'll be there for you.

249
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:44,790
I'll earn money for both of us.

250
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,150
Wait a minute.

251
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:49,150
Yuri, don't you think it's a good idea?

252
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,340
Are you playing hot and cold on me?

253
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:54,510
Yuri, just agree with me.

254
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:56,320
With the three of us together,

255
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,070
♪ Happy life and happy home ♪

256
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:02,160
♪ La-la-la-la-la ♪

257
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,100
Single mother...

258
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,790
Crap! I've been brainwashed.

259
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:21,520
- I prefer a normal marriage. 
 - Yo.

260
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:26,130
You should've knocked. What if I was changing?

261
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:29,620
So what? It's fine since you're my girlfriend.

262
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,130
We broke up, remember?

263
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:35,190
I told you it's until the final judgment of the Junon contest ends.

264
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:42,510
Can you say the words I'm going to tell you?

265
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,780
Say "You filthy sow!"

266
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:49,730
I'm not the type to harass my co-workers.

267
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:51,400
Just say it.

268
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:59,570
- You filthy sow! 
 - What?

269
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:01,510
Who are you calling a sow?

270
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:04,560
You're the one who told me to say this.

271
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,850
I guess I'm not a masochist.

272
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,380
It was simply upsetting.

273
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,910
Yes, Ma'am.

274
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:18,170
I've never known such a world existed.

275
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:20,510
Was it good stress relief?

276
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:21,850
Yeah.

277
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:25,360
It felt like the fog in front of me had cleared up.

278
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:28,120
Can we do that again?

279
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,640
What?

280
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,570
We agreed that it was a one-time thing.

281
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:35,680
- My body won't be able to endure it. 
 - The weather is volatile.

282
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,630
I may be covered with fog again.

283
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:44,310
Aren't you willing to accept my anger on behalf of your friend?

284
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,470
I said that but...

285
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:50,030
I've given up all hope in life.

286
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:51,650
If I've lost control of myself,

287
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:55,430
I might have hurt her badly.

288
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,910
Such as a double suicide.

289
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,740
She may be sympathizing with you, but she wouldn't...

290
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:07,670
I will force her to die with me.

291
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:13,480
Sorry for the wait.

292
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:19,560
Kairi visited me at the hospital the other day.

293
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:23,840
Yes, the day you were hit by a bicycle.

294
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:26,030
Oh, okay.

295
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:32,400
It may be the work of the stalker who sent you the sex toys.

296
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,140
Kairi, did you tell him that?

297
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,560
I was complimenting you.

298
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,510
You care about others although you have worries of your own.

299
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:42,100
That's right. You care about my wife and me.

300
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,550
You're really honest and kind.

301
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:47,580
Not at all.

302
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,650
Welcome.

303
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:27,610
I was dying for more drinks, so I started without you.

304
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:29,010
What's going on?

305
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:30,000
What have you done?

306
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,040
Are you interrogating me as soon as you walk in?

307
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,060
What's going on with Professor Fuwa?

308
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,590
I've already told you.

309
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:39,180
When I visited him at the hospital, we talked a lot.

310
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,110
He's having a hard time just like you, Yuri.

311
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:43,650
I sympathize with him.

312
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:46,800
Did he spend a night here last night?

313
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,660
What? How...? It was really early in the morning.

314
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:53,850
I woke up early because I had a weird dream.

315
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:55,530
Did you fantasize again?

316
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:57,830
Were you excited by the S&M talk we had?

317
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:00,090
Don't dodge my question.

318
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:02,320
What is your relationship with Professor Fuwa?

319
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,320
I felt sorry for him. He needs relief sometimes, so I let him.

320
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,730
He must feel lifeless since his wife is bedridden.

321
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:11,210
Cut the crap.

322
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:13,400
The relationship between Professor and his wife isn't lifeless.

323
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,920
Their hearts are connected.

324
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,030
- Eternal love? 
 - That's right.

325
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:20,550
Don't seduce him into the wanton world of yours.

326
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:24,050
Jealous? Are you jealous of Professor?

327
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:26,800
Wait. Who are you jealous of?

328
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,830
Is it me or Professor?

329
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:32,220
Who are you jealous of?

330
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:35,550
Did you pour candle wax on Professor and whip him?

331
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:38,660
I'm sure you wouldn't believe me even if I say we just talked.

332
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,590
- I won't believe you. 
 - I thought so.

333
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:43,700
I can't believe you.

334
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:48,120
Well, have a seat and drink.

335
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,820
Shiho and Tomomi might have been right after all.

336
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,090
What?

337
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:55,460
A person who lived in a dark world cannot be reformed.

338
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,660
Just like a drug addict that never stays clean.

339
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,920
You would go back into the industry if they call you.

340
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:04,810
No way. I severed all my ties with them, including my mom.

341
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,830
I changed my phone number and LINE account.

342
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,690
But she's crazy,

343
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:13,300
she might find me again to borrow money.

344
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,010
I'm not like you.

345
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:16,240
Like what?

346
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,210
I mean I'm different from you, Kairi.

347
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:20,960
This is why it's so interesting.

348
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,680
Whether we have the same value or not is total rubbish.

349
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,670
It would only hold you back from exploring a different world.

350
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:28,980
I'm different from you. So is Shiho and Tomomi.

351
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:32,380
Especially, Professor Fuwa who has an untainted heart.

352
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,830
He swore eternal love to his wife who was in an accident.

353
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,250
You brought disgrace on his love.

354
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:39,790
We're not having an affair. It's just for fun.

355
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:42,330
You disgust me.

356
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:46,890
I thought you were innocent at heart.

357
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:49,030
I know you have suffered a lot in the past.

358
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:50,780
But you didn't dwell on the past.

359
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:53,270
Your job as a realtor and certification test to be a broker.

360
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:56,290
I was impressed by your effort, but...

361
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,930
There's no way.

362
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,620
I can't be your friend anymore.

363
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:05,030
Yuri...

364
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,800
Give me the ring back.

365
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,370
Give me the friendship ring.

366
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:17,660
No.

367
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,900
Stop it.

368
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,650
Please don't.

369
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:44,610
Forget it.

370
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,710
I'll take it off first.

371
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:51,310
Please. Don't do that.

372
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:54,390
You can have it all to yourself.

373
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:57,280
Wait. Don't go, Yuri.

374
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:13,160
Yuri...

375
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:19,410
Lame. I know you're faking to cry anyway.

376
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:34,720
She knew?

377
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,530
Am I lame?

378
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,740
I was way out of line...

379
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,950
Wasn't I?

380
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:21,880

[Preview] 
 I see you've taken off the friendship ring.

392
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:32,720
I feel stupid wearing it alone.

393
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,960
She agreed to meet me alone.

394
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,800
She? Do you mean Yuri?

395
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,030
I have no use for you anymore.

396
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:43,150
Excuse me. Perhaps, are you...?

397
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:45,890
Welcome back.

398
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:47,080
Mama?
