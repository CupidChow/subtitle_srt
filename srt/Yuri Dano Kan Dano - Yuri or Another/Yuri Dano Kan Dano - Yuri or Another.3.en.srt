1
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:04,810
Yuri?

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:07,630
I'm Kairi Ninomiya. We went to the same elementary school.

3
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:09,080
You used to be a junior idol, right?

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,510
Dressing like that as a child would mess up one's sexuality.

5
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:14,000
Do you exchange LINE messages with Shuji?

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,730
I'm concerned that you're flirting with your friend's boyfriend.

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:18,640
Seriously, it pisses me off.

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,590
Professor Fuwa...

9
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:23,390
his wife has been in a vegetative state due to an accident.

10
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,470
He says he still loves her.

11
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:26,790
I was really touched by that.

12
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:30,040
You're kind... to everyone.

13
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:33,710
Just like they said

14
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:36,460
maybe my sexuality is messed up.

15
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,480
Delivery. Thank you.

16
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,940
What's the matter?

17
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,000
A sex toy?

18
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,690
- Did you buy this? 
 - Of course not!

19
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:14,520
I was half asleep when it arrived, so I opened it.

20
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,900
It's from an unknown sender.

21
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,140
It must be from the stalker.

22
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,950
I just moved. How come he already knows my new address?

23
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:23,770
- Calm down. 
 - How can I stay calm?

24
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:25,970
So perverted.

25
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,110
I should report it to the police.

26
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:30,250
I can come along if you're going.

27
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,580
But I don't recommend it.

28
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:34,470
- Why not? 
 - Because they will question you.

29
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,240
A police officer wants to know the details.

30
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,170
- Is this yours? 
 - I said no.

31
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:42,430
It must be a gift because you use it regularly.

32
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:43,910
I do not use it.

33
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:47,910
Are you sure? Young girls nowadays have a vibrator or two.

34
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,260
Not me.

35
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:53,370
Just like that. He might question the details with a salacious smile on his face.

36
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:55,600
- No. 
 - That's not all.

37
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,260
Most rape victims don't go through with the process,

38
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,940
because it's like a second rape for them.

39
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:02,760
The police would pester them with questions.

40
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,820
But...

41
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,280
Be rational for a second.

42
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,130
Now we have a clue about the culprit.

43
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:10,990
It's someone who knows your new apartment.

44
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,050
My parents, Shiho,

45
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:18,910
Tomomi, and Shuji.

46
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,270
It has improved.

47
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,600
So cute.

48
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,810
- You can have it if you want. 
 - Really?

49
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:27,460
Lucky.

50
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,140
- It's cute, isn't it? 
 - Not really.

51
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,710
- Here. 
 - Don't poke me.

52
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:31,800
Yuri.

53
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,430
He could be watching you right now from somewhere.

54
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:35,660
- To enjoy your reaction. 
 - What?

55
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:40,320
- Hello! 
 - Wait.

56
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,910
Stop it. Don't provoke him.

57
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,550
You should show him you're not distressed by it.

58
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:48,440
- Should I? 
 - Your fear gives him pleasures.

59
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:55,650
Hello!

60
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:57,800
Hello!

61
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,620
[Yuri or Another]

62
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,070
[Episode 3]

63
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,170
A sex toy?

64
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:14,580
You're too loud.

65
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,440
How many are there? What type?

66
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,520
Gosh, how naughty.

67
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,790
Show us.

68
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:21,650
I wouldn't bring them to school.

69
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:23,340
During a baggage inspection, some idol

70
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,430
got caught having it in her pause.

71
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,560
The rumor said it was a hair dryer.

72
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,980
We wouldn't know that.

73
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,710
You can order online lately.

74
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,600
It's a casual thing for a couple to buy it together.

75
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,480
Don't tell me... you have one. A vibrator.

76
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,400
Of course not.

77
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,110
We're sexually passive.

78
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:41,130
You seem to be enjoying sex talk.

79
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:43,030
Wait. That's not the issue here.

80
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:46,490
You're not still doubting us, are you?

81
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:49,990
Just because we refused to show you LINE messages from Shuji.

82
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:51,300
Good point.

83
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,750
You two are the few people who know where I live.

84
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,500
- Hey. 
 - Just kidding.

85
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,940
That was nothing but a figure of speech.

86
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,030
We were just chatting. I wasn't suspecting you.

87
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,760
We're besties, aren't we?

88
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,690
Oh? Still no rings?

89
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:04,770
On the contrary,

90
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:07,340
I suspect a certain person.

91
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,600
The person who breaks up the friendship is the most suspicious.

92
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,640
This is a basic theory in a mystery novel.

93
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,170
Breaking up a friendship?

94
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,720
Right.

95
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,100
The purpose of a stalker is harassment.

96
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,220
It doesn't have to be the opposite sex.

97
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,900
Kairi?

98
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,670
No way. Impossible.

99
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,330
The stalking started at the previous apartment.

100
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:31,350
It was a mere coincidence to go to the real estate agency.

101
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:33,800
Besides, she doesn't have a reason to harass me.

102
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,250
She does, sort of.

103
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,500
She wants to break up our friendship.

104
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,970
So she can have you all to herself. Or...

105
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,840
she is jealous of your friends.

106
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,520
Please, you should be friends with only me.

107
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,440
- Something like that. 
 - That's absurd.

108
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,860
I can understand if we're elementary or middle school students with no boyfriend.

109
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:54,340
Holding hands to go to a restroom that sort of thing.

110
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,120
Don't speak ill of her.

111
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,220
Kairi regrets her action and wants to apologize to you.

112
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,940
[Please enter the passcode.]

113
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,710
It's you. Yuri's...

114
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:27,680
I'm Kairi.

115
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,480
That's it. Kairi.

116
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,140
I don't know if Yuri told you, but...

117
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,140
I'm Junon's final applicant.

118
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,250
If you don't mind, please root for me.

119
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,550
I'm not asking for money,

120
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:39,430
but it'd be great if you can send me stars.

121
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,320
Sure.

122
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,550
Do you want to exchange LINE accounts?

123
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,620
I'd love to.

124
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,940
- Me? 
 - It's funny, right?

125
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:59,560
It's impossible since the stalking started at my previous apartment.

126
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,700
Supposedly...

127
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,600
If I happen to see you somewhere and follow you to your apartment,

128
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,850
there is the possibility that I've known your old apartment.

129
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:10,680
But what are the odds of me

130
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,840
choosing your real estate agency?

131
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,810
It's possible.

132
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:17,830
My agency is located on a straight line between your college and the old apartment.

133
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:20,260
A student doesn't have a lot of money to spend on rent.

134
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,700
Express trains don't stop,

135
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,110
but the apartments near the train station are reasonable.

136
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,140
Welcome.

137
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,660
When you search online,

138
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:29,090
our agency shows up on the top.

139
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:32,050
But you don't have a reason to harass me.

140
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,990
Just like they said,

141
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,780
I'm jealous of your friends.

142
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,880
Because I want to be your bestie,

143
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,140
I accused those two obstacles purposely.

144
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:43,200
You better be joking.

145
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,490
That's what you do before you have a boyfriend.

146
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:48,800
You go to the restroom holding hands with your friends.

147
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:54,700
What the elementary and middle school students do...

148
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,050
I'm so happy

149
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:00,060
It's not scary to walk in the dark with you.

150
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:03,550
That means the sex toys were the real present for me?

151
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:04,870
Do you want to play with me?

152
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:07,000
We're not doing that together.

153
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,030
Kiss? Did Kairi kiss you?

154
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:17,890
I'm telling you that you are too loud!

155
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:21,040
It was just a peck because we were drunk.

156
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,620
- I knew it. 
 - We thought she was "L".

157
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:27,260
L? That's possible. 
  (T/N: Lesbian)

158
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,860
Seeing you can make a joke out of it,

159
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,280
you don't hate it?

160
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,220
She touches me a lot,

161
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,790
and I don't like clingy people.

162
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,980
So you're not afraid of it, Yuri?

163
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,300
Afraid? Why?

164
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,260
So, you have a tendency of it, too.

165
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:45,510
Me? No way.  Besides, I have a boyfriend.

166
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:47,780
The fans of Takarazuka are mostly women.
(T/N: Takarazuka is a women-only performance company.)

167
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:50,530
Women admire beautiful things.

168
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:51,900
That's where it starts.

169
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,650
Do you think the Takarazuka fan would accept it,

170
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:57,810
if a male-role actoress asks to spend the night?

171
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,010
Well...

172
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,400
What would I do if I was a fan...

173
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,170
To put it simply...

174
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:06,000
Between a really disgusting man

175
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,920
and a beautiful woman, who would you sleep with?

176
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,990
Mentally, I can't stand a disgusting man.

177
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,510
Me too. I prefer a beautiful girl like Kairi.

178
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:17,100
Me too. If I have to choose between the two.

179
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:20,440
That's too extreme to compare a disgusting man and Kairi.

180
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,180
Shuji is not disgusting.

181
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,430
I can't do it with a woman.

182
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:26,120
Not to mention, sometimes

183
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,430
I think she is sexy.

184
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:31,700
Come to think of it, we call lesbians "Yuri."

185
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,950
It's a stretch, but I knew you would say that.

186
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:37,600
- We do.  
 - But why do we call it "Yuri" (lily)?

187
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,440
Because... it's white?

188
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:47,170
What should we eat?

189
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:48,680
I'm hungry.

190
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,330
- Should we go to a convenience store? 
 - Let's go.

191
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,440
Hello, there.

192
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,270
Professor Fuwa?

193
00:08:56,270 --> 00:09:00,080
My wife... she regained consciousness.

194
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:02,040
What?

195
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,400
- Cheers! 
 - Cheers!

196
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:12,820
You're very beautiful, Kairi.

197
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,590
Here you go again!

198
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,640
Do you say that to every girl?

199
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,940
Can you tell? No, I'm kidding.

200
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:21,370
I'm not saying it to be nice.

201
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:22,990
I seriously think you are beautiful.

202
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:24,600
Thank you!

203
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,130
But it's not good to compliment your girlfriend's friend on her looks.

204
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:29,830
Yuri? Hold on.

205
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:31,630
We've already broken up.

206
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:34,800
You are just faking it until the Junon contest ends, right?

207
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,300
The thing about men.

208
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,450
If he refuses to see you because he's busy with work,

209
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:41,390
that means it's over.

210
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,970
Cunning.

211
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:44,590
When you fall out of love,

212
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:47,050
you should break up with her properly.

213
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:49,790
But I don't like drama...

214
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,030
and tears.

215
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,590
I get it.

216
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:56,120
It may not look like it,  but Yuri is affectionate.

217
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,730
Sometimes I feel annoyed and heavy.

218
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:04,760
A girl with a cool beauty like you is more my type.

219
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:07,770
I could be affectionate, too.

220
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:09,080
Huh?

221
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:16,080
Sorry. My stomach feels weird again.

222
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:24,890
Take your time.

223
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:33,320
[Passcode]

224
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:38,480
Good job!

225
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:53,300
It's true. She moved her finger this morning.

226
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,650
It was like she was pressing a passcode of some sort.

227
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,710
Professor, the doctor said it was just a vital reaction.

228
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:03,670
You're wrong. I can tell.

229
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:07,030
She is alive and has a will.

230
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:09,030
She is sending me a sign

231
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:12,520
that she is going to wake up soon.

232
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,960
Isn't that right, Reiko?

233
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:20,440
Reiko!

234
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,190
Reiko!

235
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:26,700
- Professor... 
 - Reiko!

236
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:29,590
Please stop.

237
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:43,340
You are worried about us the most,

238
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:46,820
among my students.

239
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:49,460
I know it was you

240
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:53,100
who sometimes changed the flowers.

241
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,010
So you...

242
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:59,140
should be the first to know.

243
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:06,780
Yes!

244
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:22,150
Good work!

245
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:25,110
What? Aren't you off today?

246
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:27,210
I still have work to do.

247
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:30,780
I don't like to work at home.

248
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:33,220
You should go on a date with your boyfriend.

249
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,980
I don't have a boyfriend.

250
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,040
If you wanted to know that...

251
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,490
I don't.

252
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:41,990
What about you? I bet you are popular with girls.

253
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:46,380
At my age, the women I date want to get married.

254
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,690
You have no desire to get married?

255
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:51,530
The marriage system in this country is too favorable to women.

256
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:53,070
Even if I work until I die,

257
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:55,500
the house and the insurance money will go to the wife.

258
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,510
When I divorce, the wife gets custody and I would never see the kids.

259
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,500
That's not cost-effective at all.

260
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,630
I suppose.

261
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:04,370
You sound apathetic.

262
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:06,290
So are you.

263
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:11,090
No. I'm seeking true love.

264
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:21,040
That must be true love, right?

265
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:30,220
Welcome back.

266
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,400
I'm back.

267
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,780
I want to talk to you.

268
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:36,650
Ah, me too. Where?

269
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,060
Wherever.

270
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,390
I'll come over after taking a shower.

271
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:44,120
Then I'll take a shower, too.

272
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,710
- Good work! 
 - Good work!

273
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:05,850
You go ahead first.

274
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:08,860
It's difficult for me to say this, so...

275
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:12,220
Me, too.

276
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:15,370
Fine, then.

277
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:23,860
Here.

278
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,250
[I'm single now. Should we date?] 
 [No, I won't since you're my friend.]

279
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,940
[So, do you want to go on a date?] 
 [Okay, only if you're paying]

280
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,550
[If I win, do you want to go to eat grilled meat?] 
 [I want to go!]

281
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,990
That's...

282
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:36,360
That's Shiho...

283
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:41,200
These are the message between Tomomi and Shuji.
[Did you really break up with Yuri?]

284
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,410
[Till the contest is over, but I will break up if you want to date me.] 
 [You're lying.]

285
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:45,370
I told you so. 
 [Honestly, I like you more than Yuri]

286
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:49,170
They seem to be joking, but they like to flirt with him.

287
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:52,350
Or rather, they are asking him if he really broke up with you.

288
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:56,280
They say they can't date him because you are their friend, but they enjoy it.

289
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,250
Look at Tomomi's message.

290
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,440
"To be honest, because Yuri said she likes you,

291
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,970
so I had no choice but to give up."

292
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:05,160
It makes you mad, right?

293
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,020
That's how women are.

294
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,460
They say they are friends,

295
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:11,980
but reveal their true colors when a handsome guy hits on them for fun.

296
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:15,190
How did you get the screenshots?

297
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:17,010
I had a meal with Shuji.

298
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:19,610
- You didn't tell me. 
 - I'm telling you now.

299
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:22,850
I looked from behind and memorized his passcode at the cafeteria during the day.

300
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:28,070
This is how you get the proof when you are investigating adulatory.

301
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,280
I can't believe it!

302
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,970
I would say he's defenseless.

303
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:34,080
Or more like stupid.

304
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:39,040
It may not look it, but Yuri is too affectionate.

305
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,720
Sometimes I feel annoyed and heavy.

306
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:48,020
A girl with a cool beauty like you is more my type.

307
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:52,020
It's good that you broke up with a player like him.

308
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,910
Make sure to choose proper friends.

309
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,870
Some girls are superficial and

310
00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:00,760
say "I know," "I get it,"  "That's cute," to sell cheap sympathy.

311
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,650
Beneath the surface, they were hitting on their friends' boyfriend.

312
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:06,600
- Why? 
 - Hm?

313
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,560
What gives you the right to do this? I didn't ask for it.

314
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,720
Cause you're my bestie.

315
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,920
My best friend wouldn't do this to make me feel bad.

316
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,860
That's the superficial friendship I talked about.

317
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,670
You get married and make friends with other moms and in PTA.

318
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:23,410
They act friendly on the surface but talk bad behind each other's back.

319
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:27,260
Who would understand the real you when you are surrounded by people like that.

320
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:30,810
Your boyfriend? Husband? No.

321
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:33,020
The brain structure is different between a man and a woman.

322
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,380
We are practically different species.

323
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,880
I'm not looking for such a deep friendship.

324
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,300
That's like stepping into someone's house with your shoes on.

325
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,020
- You lack delicacy. 
 - I don't mind if it's you.

326
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:44,780
You can come in with your shoes on or naked.

327
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,080
Why naked?

328
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:49,400
We lick each other's deep scars where we can't reach to heal them.

329
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,310
That's what besties are for.

330
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,410
I can lick you and make you feel good.

331
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:55,160
It's a Pandora's box.

332
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,960
Cheating and betrayal are forgiven as long as you don't know?

333
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:01,210
You should open it. We have to open all the boxes.

334
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:02,540
Otherwise, you will have compiled trash.

335
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:05,460
I'm an ordinary person and I'm okay with an ordinary life.

336
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,070
I've always lived that way.

337
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:09,020
I have an ordinary family and an ordinary life,

338
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,350
I'm an ordinary college student.

339
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:12,710
I'm not twisted like you, Kairi.

340
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:21,400
Sorry.

341
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,690
Good. Keep going.

342
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:29,490
My twisted childhood and twisted life?

343
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:32,160
It hurts to hear, but it speaks to my heart.

344
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,470
I'm sorry. I know nothing of you.

345
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,270
It's okay. You said it without knowing anything.

346
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:43,250
Apologize and forgive each other. I love this.

347
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,430
I'm going to cry...

348
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:48,550
My point is, I'm different from you.

349
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,800
Of course. We're supposed to be different.

350
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,490
We compensate each other.

351
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:56,370
You're affectionate, Kairi.

352
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:59,420
Shuji said you're affectionate, too.

353
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:03,770
I think so, too. You even took your panties off and gave them to me.

354
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:07,110
- That's... 
 - Reality is made of lies.

355
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:10,850
It may be right to turn a blind eye.

356
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:13,980
You have to give up a lot of things in order to live.

357
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,080
But that's not living.

358
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,550
You are living properly.

359
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:24,920
You live only once. You should embrace all of your emotions.

360
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,590
That's hard.

361
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:31,390
It's hard to do it alone, that's why you have friends.

362
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,690
I...

363
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:41,630
Not everyone can find true love.

364
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:43,980
You don't want that, Yuri?

365
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:48,560
True... love?

366
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,960
Exactly.

367
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:58,740
♫ You're the shade... You're the shade in my heart ♫

368
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:02,110
His wife has been in a vegetative state due to an accident.

369
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:04,790
It's been decades.

370
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:06,100
When he's not at the university, 

371
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,460
he's at the hospital to be with her.

372
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,960
He told me that he talks to her every day

373
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,770
hoping that she wakes up someday.

374
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:19,520
My wife... she regained consciousness.

375
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,090
I can tell...

376
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:24,220
She is alive and has a will.

377
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,940
She is sending me a sign

378
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:28,950
that she is going to wake up soon.

379
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:34,480
♫ You're the shade... You're the shade in my heart ♫

380
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,080
Yes. I want it.

381
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,860
I want to find true love like Professor has.

382
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:40,530
Good.

383
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:44,460
Makeshift boyfriend, makeshift friends... They are phony.

384
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:47,190
That's right. You finally got it!

385
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:51,730
I'm about to cry!

386
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:58,360
credits

387
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,700
So...

388
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:04,360
There is one thing I want to clarify.

389
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,720
Are you asking if I'm the stalker?

390
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,290
Come on.

391
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,680
I went along with it because it was funny.

392
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,020
It was a miraculous coincidence to have reunited with you.

393
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,820
Not that.

394
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,080
Hmm?

395
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,180
You see...

396
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:24,660
We call those people Yuri, right?

397
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,090
Huh?

398
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:29,140
Ah... "L"? "Bian," right?

399
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:32,000
There used to be a gay magazine called "Bara-zoku." 
 (T/N: Rose family)

400
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,910
So it's called "Yuri-zoku" to complete with that. 
 (T/N: Lily family)

401
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:34,850
That how it started.

402
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:37,150
You're well informed. Awesome.

403
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:42,420
I've been living in a sexual storm since childhood.

404
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:45,620
That being said, I want to ask you...

405
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,950
Okay.

406
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:50,090
So... I mean...

407
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:51,720
What?

408
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:56,080
Are you "L"? 
 (N/T: Lesbian)

409
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,870
Stop it. My size is "S".

410
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:59,240
I'm not talking about clothes.

411
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,210
I'm going to find the perpetrator.

412
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:04,410
It's not the L from "Death Note."

413
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:06,700
Then, you tell me first.

414
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,740
The color of your nipples.

415
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:13,530
I can find out when we go to a hot spring.

416
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:22,050
It's a hot spring date.

 I want more and more of Yuri.

428
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,430
Chief, let's go.

429
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:34,570
For some reason, I feel frustlated.

430
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:37,520
I got it. How is this? Are you calm now?

431
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,580
Crap! I didn't feel anything.

432
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,410
What?

433
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:44,610
It's dangerous to seek dreams and hope in love.
