1
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:07,400
That's true love, isn't it?

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,780
Sometimes, I don't know

3
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:13,190
whether this is a dream or reality.

4
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:16,730
I think their relationship is mystical.

5
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,120
It's eternal love.

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,130
She is a friend from elementary school.

7
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:24,060
Ah, you must be the stalker victim.

8
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,090
Yuri is injured.

9
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,510
A person on a bicycle ran into her from behind in a dark alley.

10
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:34,390
It was you, right? The perpetrator.

11
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:43,920
Subtitles and Timing brought to you by 💋 The Girl Next Door 💋 Team.

12
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,510
Are you sure it's okay?

13
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:53,340
Manager Miyake sold this building to the current owner.

14
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,130
So, I get the coupons for a huge discount.

15
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:57,150
I see.

16
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:58,750
They also offer treatments for men,

17
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,440
but he isn't interested.

18
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,430
That man is kind of old-fashioned.

19
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:06,790
When you say "that man," it sounds like it has deeper meanings.

20
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:10,190
I told you. He's a hot guy who is good at his work.

21
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:12,230
If I hadn't had it with men,

22
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:15,700
I would think he's a good catch as my colleagues do.

23
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,910
He's been divorced, but no kids.

24
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:20,900
A lot of stuff may have happened, but you shouldn't give up.

25
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,120
There are good guys out there.

26
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,770
What about Shuji?

27
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:27,720
He's flirting with other girls via LINE without hesitation.

28
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,430
That's like saying hello to him.

29
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:34,250
He's simple-minded, but actually a nice person.

30
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,340
You are not going to probe into it?

31
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,130
Nothing good will come out of it.

32
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:40,960
You haven't confronted your friends

33
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,300
about flirting with Shuji on LINE?

34
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,330
Well...

35
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:48,240
They are not bad people, either.

36
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,670
If I were you,

37
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:52,870
I would press them so hard and choke them to death.

38
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:55,780
You couldn't get along with anyone if you did that.

39
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,730
Everyone would leave.

40
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:00,390
Fake friends can leave me.

41
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:05,870
Besides, I'm not respectable enough to criticize others.

42
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:08,140
I think you are great.

43
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:10,080
You don't badmouth others.

44
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,860
You are a typical nice person.

45
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,040
You are making fun of me.

46
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,050
No, I'm not. You are the opposite of me.

47
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:19,520
I mean, there are more people like me than you.

48
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,720
They are pretending to be nice, but spew venom on SNS.

49
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,170
That's okay. Let them spew venom.

50
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:28,200
What?

51
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,190
I think they are stressed.

52
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:33,840
Some people can't deal with it unless they release the stress by speaking ill of others.

53
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,960
Oh, I see.

54
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,040
They are potential criminals,

55
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,960
so it's better for them to let it out than hold it in and burst.

56
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,940
I'm not saying they are potential criminals.

57
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:47,500
Back in the day, I was able to tell if they were in gangs by their looks.

58
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,970
Nowadays, a normal-looking person would snap suddenly and go crazy.

59
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:55,230
We can't say all the flashy girls are whores.

60
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:57,590
Some are sophisticated bitches.

61
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,310
Sophisticated bitch?

62
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:03,250
They look low-key and earnest but sleep around.

63
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,540
You are so blunt.

64
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,570
They look neat and clean on the outside,

65
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:09,890
but they are bitches on the inside.

66
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:14,400
My mother was like that.

67
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,170
You shouldn't talk about your mother that way.

68
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:29,120
You have a nice figure.

69
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,100
I don't think so.

70
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,380
Hey, stop staring at me.

71
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,730
Why? I'm your best friend.

72
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:38,720
I can show you everything.

73
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,370
I'm not interested in girls' bodies.

74
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:53,090
You don't have it...

75
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:55,830
I'm a girl. No bamboo shoot is growing there.

76
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:58,820
I mean your hair.

77
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:02,730
Oh, you mean no pubes?

78
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:05,080
Glabrous?

79
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:10,640
[Yuri or Another]

80
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,970
[Episode 5]

81
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,030
No...

82
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:21,130
Pubes?

83
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:24,060
It was my first time to see the actual thing.

84
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,190
It really looked like a child's.

85
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,840
It's an etiquette to make the area clean in the US and Europe.

86
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,380
There are more people that do that in Japan, too.

87
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,800
They just don't talk about it.

88
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,300
Sashihara and Darenogare are open about it. 
 (T/N:Celebrities)

89
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,200
Really?

90
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,980
You get a yeast infection when it gets humid.

91
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,900
It's just unsanitary and the hair brings no good.

92
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,290
In the summer, it gets so itchy during your period.

93
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,510
The smell of it almost makes me puke when I squat down to pee.

94
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:52,390
And you can wear sexy underwear.

95
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:54,600
A thong or anything would look better without the hair.

96
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,490
Also, it would make the men so happy.

97
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:58,550
Men get excited with visual stimulants, you know?

98
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,020
I see.

99
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:02,820
Don't tell me you haven't taken care of it yet.

100
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,860
What? So, you are leaving it fully grown?

101
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:07,330
What? You two have shaved it, too?

102
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:09,300
- Yeah. 
 - Yeah.

103
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,270
Wow, really...

104
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,830
That's not good. You are behind the times.

105
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,490
You are unsanitary.

106
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:18,680
Am I the only one filthy?

107
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,500
I wonder how Shuji could stand it.

108
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,070
He was holding his breath, I guess.

109
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,180
It's that bad?

110
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,720
You can't know it yourself, but it's really bad.

111
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,620
He wanted to break up with you when you didn't do anything wrong,

112
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,150
but maybe that was the reason.

113
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:32,910
Is it?

114
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:35,140
He couldn't be straight with you about it.

115
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:38,900
He was tormented because he's nice.

116
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,910
Because I was smelly?

117
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:44,290
The hair gets inside and stuck there.

118
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:46,720
It's like common courtesy these days.

119
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,490
I can't believe it.

120
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:52,280
Sorry... I didn't know.

121
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,720
She got in an accident a few months after you got married.

122
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,050
Since then, she's been like this for decades.

123
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:12,260
I can't even remember what her voice sounded like anymore.

124
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,920
You were worried at first,

125
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:20,390
and you will stay by her side for the rest of your life.

126
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:25,640
I suppose you felt your strong love for her.

127
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,050
Yeah.

128
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:32,590
But that doesn't last for long.

129
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:35,860
It would be weird if it did.

130
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:39,300
I don't believe in humans that much.

131
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:43,150
I see.

132
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,930
You can't abandon her.

133
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:50,050
There is no way you can.

134
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:53,450
She is someone you once loved,

135
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:57,090
but the financial and emotional burdens get bigger.

136
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:59,430
You can't see the end of it.

137
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:03,240
It's the same as nursing your parents.

138
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:10,990
You love them, but you start to pray for them to die.

139
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:17,610
When it exceeds your capacity, you might even kill them with your own hands. It happens often.

140
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,730
I'm not criticizing you or anything.

141
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:29,210
Yuri says it's beautiful eternal love,

142
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:34,170
but that kind of attention trapped you.

143
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:39,140
She is bright and pure.

144
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:42,850
When I saw her sympathizing with me from the bottom of her heart...

145
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:45,390
She's just soft-hearted.

146
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:48,490
She is a good girl who doesn't know to doubt people.

147
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,130
I can understand.

148
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:56,410
You start to feel anger toward her for not knowing how you really feel.

149
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,340
Being soft-hearted can kill people.

150
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:04,710
No. It's not quite the same as anger.

151
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:10,380
Saving...

152
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:13,800
I wanted her to save me.

153
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,600
Save you?

154
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,400
I'm not trying to be a good person.

155
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:24,940
It's true that I sent her weird things, and in the end I impulsively...

156
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:30,910
Thank you for confessing honestly.

157
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:33,850
I thought you would play innocent and say

158
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:38,790
"What are you talking about?" "Why would I do that?"

159
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:42,230
You can report it to the police if you want.

160
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:49,070
What... You don't care anymore?

161
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,250
- Here's Peperoncino. 
 - Yes.

162
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:08,820
Here's Peperoncino.

163
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:12,280
Thank you for waiting. Your table is ready.

164
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:15,860
- Excuse me. 
 - Yes!

165
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,810
Cheese sampler, please.

166
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:19,640
Okay.

167
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,470
Here is the check. Thank you.

168
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,540
Thank you very much.

169
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:46,690
Oh, you knocked today.

170
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:54,650
The reason we broke up...

171
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:57,810
What? I told you it was the Junon contest.

172
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:00,360
Not dugong, but Junon.

173
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,890
Because I violated common etiquette?

174
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:08,040
I'm the one who is lacking delicacy, not you.

175
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:08,860
What are you talking about?

176
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:12,450
I'm going to take care of it right away, like tonight.

177
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:13,340
Take care of what?

178
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:18,690
What... it's not easy for me to say...

179
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,040
Yeah?

180
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:24,810
Pubic hair...

181
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:28,720
Seriously?

182
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,710
You are saying, you are going to make it like that white Mahjong tile...

183
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,690
You are shaving your pubes?

184
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,430
What happened to you?

185
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:41,330
A lot happened... Sorry.

186
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:46,080
I mean, I really want to see it.

187
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,550
I want to see it so bad, seriously.

188
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:56,170
But... I have to endure until the last stage of the Junon contest ends.

189
00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:01,880
No. I want to see it. I have to.

190
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:05,320
Men get excited and happy...

191
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,330
They were right.

192
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,920
The weather is so nice today.

193
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,430
What?

194
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:21,690
Not really.

195
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:23,780
Maybe it's just me.

196
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:28,350
I feel like it's a refreshing and crisp morning.

197
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,380
Did anything good happen?

198
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:34,730
Good thing? It's more like I was reborn.

199
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:37,320
I feel like I'm a child again.

200
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,580
What?

201
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:42,930
I mean I did it, too, last night.

202
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:44,360
What did you do?

203
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,160
What I did was...

204
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:54,140
I wanted to tell you we're the same.

205
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:56,790
The same? What do you mean?

206
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:57,720
You mean the ring?

207
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,690
We have a matching friendship ring, but...

208
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,500
I'm talking about down there.

209
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,260
I shaved it.

210
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,230
What?

211
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:08,990
Is it so surprising to you?

212
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:10,990
Thank you for the meal.

213
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:14,340
I feel embarrassed.  All these years...

214
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:17,710
It's unsanitary and stinks when it sweats in the summer.

215
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,480
It's clearly an etiquette violation.

216
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,480
Shuji is considerate, so he broke up with me

217
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,080
- without mentioning it. 
 - You're joking, right?

218
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,700
I'm not joking.

219
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,410
It's a common courtesy, isn't it?

220
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:30,430
Shiho and Tomomi are also shaving, too.

221
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:36,270
- They must have teased you. 
 - Huh?

222
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:38,040
Thank you for the food.

223
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,180
I guess it's common in the US and Europe.

224
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:43,700
But there are only a few in a hundred in Japan.

225
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,050
You're lying.

226
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:46,230
I'm not lying.

227
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:48,220
But...

228
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:51,330
Whatever.

229
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:52,910
Shuji seemed to be really curious about it.

230
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:55,790
It's likely for men to get excited through the visual stimulations.

231
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,510
It's fine if it's a boyfriend.

232
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,760
But what happens

233
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,270
if you meet someone new?

234
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:03,270
He might think you're a slut.

235
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:05,990
Japanese men are still conservative somewhat.

236
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:08,180
That is...

237
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,720
You'd be embarrassed when you go to a hot spring.

238
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,640
I'm the type who doesn't care about the public eye.

239
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:17,530
I... do care what others think.

240
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,260
I thought so.

241
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:22,050
When you get older, your kids might say something.

242
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:25,010
My kids would say "Mom, what happened to you?"

243
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:27,550
It's indeed sanitary, but

244
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,810
it's hard to keep it neat every day.

245
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:32,740
The pubes grow faster than the rest of your hair.

246
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:36,150
The pee runs down your thigh and it becomes wet if you're not used to it.

247
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,520
Aren't you the same, Kairi?

248
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,370
I got treatment to remove my hair permanently.

249
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:40,620
Maybe I should...

250
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,360
I don't want people to think I'm sleeping around.

251
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,250
Don't worry. It will grow back soon enough.

252
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,510
You're right.

253
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:49,050
But it will hurt like hell.

254
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:52,430
Like being stabbed with pins and needles.

255
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:56,420
Why have you taken their word for it?

256
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:00,640
I'm sorry. I trust others too easily.

257
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,530
You don't need to apologize.

258
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:06,220
I admit that's one of your charms.

259
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,480
It's not a charm. I'm just stupid.

260
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,670
I think it's charming. However...

261
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:14,830
you would be a perfect prey for cons.

262
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,490
Such as a phishing scam...

263
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:19,580
Ordinary people would think, "It's all over the news,

264
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,720
it'd be stupid to fall for it."

265
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,270
People fall for it because they're soft-hearted with good intentions.

266
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,300
I'll keep that in mind.

267
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,240
No. I don't want you to change, Yuri.

268
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,560
I don't want to get scammed, because I'm credulous.

269
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,580
- I will protect you. 
 - What?

270
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,370
I'll protect you,

271
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:39,230
so stay charming as you always have been.

272
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:41,280
Oh, okay.

273
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,000
If you say so...

274
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:47,330
I see.

275
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:50,370
You shaved?

276
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:53,690
I knew it. You were making fun of my naiveness.

277
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:56,990
I wasn't. Being with you is my salvation.

278
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:59,970
- Salavation? 
 - That's right.

279
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:06,170
As for now, we both have no pubes.

280
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:11,530
Should we show it to each other?

281
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:13,360
Heck no!

282
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,580
Welcome.

283
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:31,540
Good evening.

284
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:37,920
Oh, it's you.

285
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,140
Are you working?

286
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:43,320
Well... When I stopped by here on the way home,

287
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,790
I received a call from my junior about his mess up.

288
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:49,780
I hate having to return to the office, so I'm working here.

289
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:52,150
You said a junior,  do you mean Kairi?

290
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:54,770
No, she is a capable worker.

291
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:56,910
More so than typical male workers.

292
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,010
Glad to hear that.

293
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:00,580
I want to have my own agency one day.

294
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:03,850
When I do, I will recruit her.

295
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:06,680
She is a perfect work partner to have.

296
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:10,270
Smart and quick-witted.

297
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:13,680
Do you consider her as only a work partner?

298
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:17,170
It's nothing.

299
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:23,190
It looks like she's not working today.

300
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:26,550
No. Actually, I knew that.

301
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,930
Didn't you call me here to apologize to her? Because I am...

302
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:33,160
Her stalker?

303
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,390
Right.

304
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,700
I changed my mind.

305
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,270
Report me to the police?

306
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:42,280
No,  I wouldn't.

307
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,370
As I said the other day,

308
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,470
the relationship you have with your wife

309
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:50,720
is ideal for Yuri.

310
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,000
She is idealizing.

311
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,480
Yes.

312
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,850
She would be devastated if she discovered that you were the stalker.

313
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,670
I suppose.

314
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:04,140
Among all the people I've met,

315
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:07,490
Yuri is the most honest and considerate.

316
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:11,220
She never doubts others which is hard to believe.

317
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:15,110
I bet her heart is pure.

318
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:18,120
I can see that.

319
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,960
I know you do.

320
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:24,520
That's why you're attracted to her.

321
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:28,600
Just like a moth attracted to lights.

322
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,990
A moth?

323
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,710
I'm sorry.

324
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:39,490
I feel the same way as you.

325
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:44,750
I know how you feel about seeking salvation through Yuri.

326
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,470
You too?

327
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:48,140
Yes.

328
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:51,280
She is a beauty for sure.

329
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,750
I've never seen her as a woman.

330
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:54,790
For real?

331
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:59,320
No, I get a feeling that she isn't interested in men.

332
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,470
Because she is...

333
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,230
"L"? 
 (T/N: Lesbian)

334
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:04,210
Am I wrong?

335
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:08,260
About that, I can't deny it clearly.

336
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,170
Don't tell me, you're her...

337
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:12,890
I'm not. Besides, I have a boyfriend.

338
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:14,750
You do?

339
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:23,580
She was a junior idol before.

340
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,240
Did you know that?

341
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:29,340
Really? I didn't know.

342
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:32,710
I heard her photos were pretty racy.

343
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:34,460
Racy?

344
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,960
Wearing a swimsuit.

345
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:40,140
Although she was young, she was asked to pose salaciously.

346
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,530
In order to sell her DVDs,

347
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:45,330
she held an event to hug old geezers.

348
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:48,050
The old geezers who are infatuated with young girls?

349
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:53,360
It's traumatic that incomparable to a shaking-hand event.

350
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,430
Her mom treated her horribly.

351
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:58,290
I can guess.

352
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:01,260
A mother who forces a child into doing such things,

353
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,890
I can imagine how immoral she could be.

354
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:08,270
She calls her mom "sophisticated bitch."

355
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:12,240
She dresses sophisticated, but actually a slut.

356
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,090
Right.

357
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:18,280
Her sexuality is messed up because of the environment she was raised.

358
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,100
I didn't know.

359
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:25,050
So she's disgusted with men.

360
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:30,430
She also hates women because of her mom.

361
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:35,580
Can you help her out?

362
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,390
Me?

363
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:41,960
But... I am divorced.

364
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,630
People get divorced all the time nowadays.

365
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:49,090
Looking lonely could be the factor of your popularity.

366
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:53,470
Indeed, I'm lonely

367
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:58,670
since I'm an old man eating dinner alone in a place like this.

368
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:04,640
In fact, I think she likes you.

369
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,820
If she didn't suffer from experiences in the past,

370
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:09,390
she said you're a "preferred property" (good catch).

371
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:10,950
Did she say that about me?

372
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:12,560
She did.

373
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:23,170
You care a lot about your friend.

374
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:28,520
Even though we've met after a long time, we are...

375
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,240
besties.

376
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,100
Besties?

377
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,420
You're not reporting me to the police.

378
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:39,880
You don't want me to apologize to her either.

379
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,040
Then, what should I do?

380
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,530
Just be a gentle husband as you are.

381
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:48,220
As if you're living in the world of eternal love.

382
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,900
Be an ideal husband for her?

383
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,050
Right.

384
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:52,420
I'd love to, but...

385
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,020
I know

386
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:57,600
you need a target to vent your severe stress and anger.

387
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:01,420
If I can't stop myself, I might do something to her again.

388
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,780
You might do something far worse.

389
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:06,970
Sending sex toys and watching from afar wasn't enough.

390
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:08,020
You hurt her physically.

391
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:10,430
I ran into her with a bicycle.

392
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:11,860
After I realized what I'd done,

393
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:14,080
I managed to run home that day.

394
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,240
Do you think you won't be able to stop yourself?

395
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,400
That's right.

396
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:26,660
You can vent your anger on me.

397
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,160
What?

398
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,740
You can do to me whatever you like.

399
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,770
To you?

400
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,060
Because I'm her bestie.

401
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:58,020
Subtitles and Timing brought to you by 💋 The Girl Next Door 💋 Team.

402
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:05,630
Yuri?

403
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,050
Kairi.

404
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:10,150
What's the matter?

405
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,300
It hurts.

406
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:19,240
I told you it's painful as you were stabbed by pins and needles.

407
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,340
Don'g laugh.

408
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,590
How could you be so silly?

409
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:25,820
Slow down. It hurts.

410
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,570
Don't apply any hair removal cream.

411
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:33,350
It causes rashes and itches like crazy.

412
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,420
Should I shave again?

413
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,780
It never ends.

414
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:39,460
It would thin down your hair and stop growing in the end.

415
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,640
Glabrous!

416
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,180
You would hate it, wouldn't you? Embarrassing, right?

417
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,640
So endure the pain for now.

418
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,290
Okay.

419
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:47,310
Let me take your pants off.

420
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:49,630
No, I can do it.

421
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:53,190
It's not embarrassing because we're besties.

422
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:56,120
It's embarrassing even between friends.

423
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:00,510
After giving birth, normally a young male intern stitches you up.

424
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:03,150
You wouldn't care about anything after having a baby.

425
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:04,740
Here we go.

426
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:07,060
You'd be saying "whatever."

427
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:09,810
Come on. Let's stand you up.

428
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,250
It's turning red.

429
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:28,560
Ugh, do whatever you like!

430

[Preview]
I really thought you were innocent at heart.

441
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:42,560
It feels like the fog in front of me has cleared up.

442
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:45,390
What? Professor?

443
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:47,470
What is your relationship with Professor Fuwa?

444
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:50,950
I felt sorry for him. I thought he should get some relief sometimes.

445
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:53,160
You're disgusting.
