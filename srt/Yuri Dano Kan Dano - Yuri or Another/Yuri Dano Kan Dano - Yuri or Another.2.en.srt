00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:10,500
I'm Kairi Ninomiya. We went to the same elementary school.

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,700
You used to be a junior idol, right?

6
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,190
You didn't even help with my move.

7
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,620
Aren't you even concerned when your girlfriend has been stalked by someone?

8
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,560
When I peed my pants in the classroom,

9
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,800
you took off your panties and lend them to me.

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,610
I really wanted to become your bestie.

18
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:03,820
Strawberry print panties...

19
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:06,260
I guess I used to wear something like that.

20
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,970
It's my treasure.

21
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,790
Is she a pervert or what?

22
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,060
- Oh! 
 - Good morning!

23
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:22,130
Yeah, good morning... but why?

24
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:25,800
Didn't I tell you? I live next door.

25
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,960
I don't think you told me.

26
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,050
I didn't? Well, then. Nice to meet you, neighbor.

27
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,060
You, too.

28
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,390
I was afraid some weirdo would move in next door.

29
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,470
Fortunately, you showed up at the right time.

30
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,700
- I see. 
 - We are women who live alone.

31
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,010
It makes me feel secure to have a friend next door.

32
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:47,300
That's true.

33
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,950
Is that non-combustible trash?

34
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,680
It's tomorrow.

35
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,570
Sorry.

36

Oh, well.

37
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:14,590
I feel today will be a great day because I'm starting the day with you.

 - Yeah.

00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,490
- What about you, Yuri? 
 - I'm almost done.

44
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,730

 - I haven't even started.

45

Seriously? Why?

46
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,370
You should get started soon.

47
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,170
Look. The video with a junior idol is pretty racy.

48
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:01,100
For real? So Kairi was doing something like this, too?

49
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,060
No way. She was only an elementary school student.

50
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,010
Isn't it illegal to upload child pornography?

51
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:08,360
It's eroticism with clothes on.

52
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,020
This is nothing.

00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,300

No. I haven't even started on it.

The last step of the Junon contest is starting soon,

00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,230
Idiot. You are going to fail this class.

Why are you watching this?

61
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:29,040
Do you remember Kairi, who came to our campus the other day?

62
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,940
The beauty? Is she in the entertainment business?

63
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,910
She is a realtor now,

64
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:35,170
but she used to be a junior idol.

65
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:37,680
It's the 3D version of a neoteny anime, isn't it?

66
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,610
There is always a certain number of men who are attracted to little girls.

67
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:41,810
That's gross.

68
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:44,270
The photo session with the fans is even grosser.

69
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:47,880
Not just shaking hands, but fans can buy the right to hold the girl.

70
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,030
What the hell? The idol will be held by a disgusting nerd?

71
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,040
No way.

72
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,430
That's a super traumatizing experience to have a picture taken that way.

73
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:56,200
They are desperate to sell their DVDs.

74
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,490
More so for their parents than the kids.

75
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:01,180
You used to be a fat nerd...

76
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,010
I like 2D. I'm an anime nerd.

77
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,580
So, I like stuff like Madoka Magika. 
 (T/N: Anime TV series)

78
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,690
I wonder how these kids will grow up to be.

79
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:12,040
I guess they will be ordinary adults.

80
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,590
Working in an office like Kairi.

81
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:17,130
I don't think so. I think they will get into the porn industry.

82
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:19,130
They may get involved with the mafia.

83
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:22,200
In the worst case, they do drugs or prostitution.

84
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,490

85

 - That's right.

What's Kairi's last name?

91
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:41,180
Something might come up if I Google her name.

92
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,500
Don't do that. She wouldn't be using her real name anyway.

93
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,400
You're right.

94
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:50,370

Okay.

98
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:08,400
Manager, this room has been vacant for a long time.

99
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,240
Ah, the rent is high.

100
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,940
Let's negotiate with the owner.

101
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,970
Okay. Thank you.

102
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:19,310
Hey, Ninomiya.

103
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,940
Did you enter the company as an administrative assistant?

104
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:22,980
Yes.

105
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:25,620
Isn't it hard to be a realtor because of the overtime?

106
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,730
But it pays well.

107
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:31,550
I bet Manager Miyake likes you, Ninomiya.

108
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:34,270
I think so, too. He always brings you along to go out for work.

109
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,800
We are just in charge of the same area.

110
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,800
That can't be the only reason, right?

111
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:43,690
What do you think of him?

112
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:45,940
Nothing.

113
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,180

114
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,050
Okay.

115
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:00,740
It's annoying.

116
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:03,990
No, nothing.

117
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,410
Thank you for the food.

118
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:15,470
Aren't you going to finish it?

119
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:17,300
You scared me.

120
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,980
I'm on a low-carb diet.

121
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:23,020
A strict diet is bad for you, especially for your skin.

122
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,670
Right. It's important to take care of my skin.

About that Instagram...

125
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:33,100
Did you post, "I haven't had a girlfriend for ages" or "I'm lonely"?

126
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:37,380
Oh, you found out. Of course, you did.

127

Some people asked me if we broke up.

The news travels fast.

131

Everyone is deceived by fake news.

132
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,540
It annoys me.

133

I understand, but please support me.

134

I'm aiming for the grand prize.

135
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,660
Not my problem.

136
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,990
You are my girlfriend. You should support your boyfriend.

137

You are the one who posted you didn't have a girlfriend.

That's true, but...

139
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:06,410
Anyway, I'm going to break up with you for real.

 - Sure.

Do you mind sharing the table with her, Professor?

150
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:55,060
She is my friend.

151

It seems you are busy for a change. I don't mind.

Not at all. Please sit.

155

No. I say you are working.

161
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,500
Why? Am I not overflowing with youthful energy?

162
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,010
You act too mature for a student.

163
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:29,180
That's not true. I'm still pure.

164

00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:39,040
Welcome.

167
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:46,620
The store manager here is so beautiful.

168
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,620
Yeah?

169
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:52,090
What's wrong? Did something happen?

170
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:56,570
I had a little problem with my boyfriend, Shuji.

171
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:58,700
Did you?

172
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,180
Wait.

173
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:06,500
I heard she suggests getting a loan to a person who looks depressed.

174
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,270
The beautiful store manager, that is.

175
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:09,890
A loan?

176
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:12,540
You can buy your ideal boyfriend with the loan.

177
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:16,270
No way. That's a myth.

178
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:18,640
Thank you.

179
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,870
Hello.

180
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,910
I'm glad.

181
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:35,480
I moved, but I'm still scared to walk alone at night.

182
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:40,470
I know. It's scary even with a stalker.

183
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:42,710
I'm really glad that I moved to this apartment.

184
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:46,380
- Thank you, Kairi. 
 - You're welcome.

185
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,010
- Here you go. 
 - Thanks.

186
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,500
Do you have a boyfriend?

187
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,940
Ah, not right now.

188
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:59,500
I don't want one. I'm studying for a realtor license.

189
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,210
- Wow, that's great. 
 - Right?

190
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:07,220
- Do you want to see my room? 
 - Can I? I'm actually curious.

191
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:10,130
I have nothing special, though.

192
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,650
- I'm coming in. 
 - Please do.

193
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:18,750
You were right. Your room is a lot different from mine.

194
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,660
I don't like having stuff.

195
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:25,340
- But it's fancy. 
 - You think?

196
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:29,420
- Okay. Here. 
 - Oh, thanks.

197
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,900
Was it okay that your professor paid for my dinner?

198
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,160
Why not?

199
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,680
Oh, well. Like a sugar daddy?

200
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:40,140
I hear some old men pay young girls to eat with them.

201
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,360
Have you done it?

202
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,120
No comment.

203
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,610
- Good work. 
 - Good work.

204
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:01,900
Professor Fuwa is handsome, isn't he?

205
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,810
Well, not bad for his age.

206
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:07,480
He is pitiful.

207
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,900
His wife has been in a vegetative state after an accident.

208
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,270
It's been decades.

209
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:16,060
-Yeah? 
 - When he's not at the university,

210
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:18,800
he's at the hospital to be with her.

211
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:21,570
That must be hard.

212
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:25,030
He told me that he talks to her every day

213
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:27,860
hoping that she wakes up someday.

214
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,210
I feel sorry for him, but I was moved to know

215
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:37,190
how much he loves her.

216
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:45,030
Oh right!

217
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,940
Ta-da!

218
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,660
Are these mine?

219
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,750
It's a reunion with the owner after a long time.

220
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,400
That's embarrassing. Give them back to me.

221
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,420
No! I told you it's my treasure.

222
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,380
Please, just give it back.

223
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,620
Sometimes, I put it over my head and smell it.

224
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,040
You are a pervert.

225
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,640
I'm a pervert.

226
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:38,760
Fine. Since you've washed them...

227
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,090
You can keep them.

228
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:42,890
Good.

229
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:45,100
I have to work on my assignment.

230
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,580
Good night.

231
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,650
She was sexy.

232
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:14,330
What am I saying?

233
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,900
I'm tired.

234
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,550
Are you tired?

235
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,290
Hello!

236
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:26,290
Kairi! Sorry for the wait!

237
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:27,980
Hello!

238
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,520
How do I look?

239
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,800
Do I look like a college girl?

240
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,770
You do! You look cute!

241
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:36,410
- So cute! 
 - You look nice.

242
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:38,140
- Shall we go? 
 - Sure.

243
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:42,430
I should act my age, and be a little more vigorous.

244
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:45,200
Even Professor Fuwa said I look mature.

245
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,680
Did you meet Professor Fuwa?

246
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,190
At the restaurant I work, he's a regular there.

247
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:51,010
He bought me dinner.

248
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:53,010
You haven't told me about that.

249
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:55,140
Are you two fans of Professor Fuwa?

250
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,380
Of course, we are.

251
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:00,180
Now that Professor Kuriyama is gone, he's the only dandy professor.

252
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,750
We have no chance now since he's met Kairi.

253
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,380
Right. She looks like she's popular with old men.

254
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,400
Me? Why is that?

255
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,370
I'm sure when you were a junior idol,  many old men...

256
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:12,400
You mean I wheedled them?

257
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,620
She did not. She was an elementary school student.

258
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:18,720
Dressing like that as a child would mess up one's sexuality.

259
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,990
Stop it.

260
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:23,880
Did you see it on Google?

261
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,780
- Well...  Sorry. 
 - Sorry.

262
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:32,270
What? You broke up with Shuji? Really?

263
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:34,640
He told me to wait until the voting period was over,

264
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,810
so I'm over him.

265
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:37,660
But it's a relief, right?

266
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,700
He lost his weight and became hot

267
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:42,150
but it made him flirtatious.

268
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:48,270
Did you exchange LINE messages with Shuji?

269
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:50,120
- Well... 
 - Yeah, I do.

270
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,970
Take out your phone and show it to Yuri.

271
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:55,290
- What do you mean? 
 - Why?

272
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:57,910
You are checking out a married man like Professor Fuwa,

273
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:01,610
so I'm worried if you are flirting with your friend's boyfriend.

274
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,000
- Huh? 
 - What are you saying?

275
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,560
I've seen people like that at work, too.

276
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,080
They talk about who likes who.

277
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:09,910
They sound envious, but actually dissing behind their backs.

278
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,630
They want everything,

279
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:13,790
but they are not confident so they badmouth others instead.

280
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:16,390
Actually, there are so many women like that in this world.

281
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:18,890
- We're her friends. 
 - We even have the ring.

282
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:20,710
There are girls who steal their friend's boyfriend

283
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:22,790
by leading him to break up with her, feeling no guilt.

284
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,920
They wouldn't do something like that.

285
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,850
Then you have no problem showing your phones.

286
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:28,320
If you don't have any feelings for Shuji,

287
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,390
you shouldn't be texting him anyway.

288
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,660
He's someone else's boyfriend...

289
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:34,990
I bet he group texts everyone to ask for a vote for him.

290
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:36,750
Is that all?

291
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,700
- What's wrong with you? 
 - Give me a break.

292
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,220
You two, sorry. Listen...

293
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:44,700
She's mad because you guys googled her junior idol past and made fun of her.

294
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,790
We apologized.

295
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:50,460
It's fine. I won't get angry about that.

296
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:54,410
So are you going to show us or not?

297
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:56,210
What are you going to do?

298
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:59,180
You can show your phones if there is nothing to hide.

299
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:02,310
He might have said something like "Let's go on a date,"

300
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:04,080
or "You are the one I really like."

301
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,370
You took his joke seriously

302
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:08,430
and sent stupid stickers, perhaps?

303
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:12,790
No way. You can show your phones, right?

304
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,690
A stalker pursues someone to the point of harassment.

305
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:19,850
It doesn't have to be the opposite sex.

306
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:20,780
What do you mean?

307
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,250
Some do it out of jealousy or envy.

308
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,280
Therefore, it could be a girl.

309
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:27,590
Someone is jealous of Shuji and me?

310
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:29,210
Really?

311
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:32,300
Yuri, do you believe someone like her?

312
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,880
- Someone like me? 
 - What kind of person are you?

313
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,410
Stop it.

314
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:40,620
I don't believe it! We're not friends anymore.

315
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,960
Me too. I'm really angry.

316
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,750
- Let's go, Shiho. 
 - I didn't say I believe her.

317
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,600
You are not going to show us your LINE messages after all?

318
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,910
Wait a sec.

319
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:02,320
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry!

320
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,660
I regret it.

321
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:07,210
I do this sometimes. I'm really sorry.

322
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:09,110
I will make sure to apologize to them.

323
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:12,350
I'm the one who should be sorry.

324
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:17,350
They shouldn't have googled you for fun, to begin with.

325
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:20,270
It's not like you did that job because you wanted to.

326
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:22,150
I did it because I wanted to.

327
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:25,460
I competed with the girls at my agency for DVD sales.

328
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,030
I thought your parents forced you into it.

329
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,900
They did, but...

330
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:33,010
You can't smile unless you somewhat enjoy it.

331
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,490
Wasn't it disgusting to be held by the fans?

332
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:37,250
It depends on a person.

333
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,990
I didn't like the smelly ones.

334
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:41,200
There were the old men who smelled sour.

335
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,160
Whoa!

336
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:50,790
Just like they said, maybe my sexuality is messed up.

337
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:51,880
That can't be true.

338
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,630
Before I even had my first period,

339
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:56,890
I straddled on an exercise ball and bounced in a tight swimsuit.

340
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:59,300
We shot in a closed room.

341
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:02,380
They would make my mom wait outside.

342
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:05,300
Sometimes, I was alone with a cameraman.

343
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:12,000
It's kind of funny. They get a boner looking at a child.

344
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,200
- Kairi? 
 - The scary thing is I was immune to it.

345
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,690
The pictures come out better that way.

346
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:19,670
When the cameramen are horny, the photos sell more.

347
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:22,910
I started to think that way.

348
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:25,100
The reason why you transferred school was...

349
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,780
My parents got a divorce.

350
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:30,800
My mom got a new boyfriend.

351
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,340
I lost count how many lovers she's had since then.

352
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:39,650
Don't tell me...  Did they do something to you?

353
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:41,750
No comment.

354
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,530
Why are you crying?

355
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:06,160
Because...

356
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,150
You think it's an awful environment? You feel sorry for me?

357
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,860
Yeah.

358
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,760
Here.

359
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,090
Even for me and Professor Fuwa...

360
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:32,920
You are nice to everyone.

361
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,560
Your sarcasm isn't funny.

362
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:40,660
Jeez, I'm getting too emtional.

363
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:48,600
I didn't mean to be funny.

364
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,510
There are people who can't be evil.

365
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:56,230
You are nice at heart. I've known that from then.

366
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:58,920
Strawberry print panties?

367
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,150
Strawberry print panties.

368
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:04,050
- Your treasure? 
 - Yes.

369
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:06,360
Since we were able to meet again,

370
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,340
if you’re so embarrassed about it, I will give them back.

371
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,180
Really?

372
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:19,910
credits

373
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:32,390
- Yuri! 
 - Kairi?

374
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:35,630
To be honest...

375
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:37,310
Mmh?

376
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,740
...my sexual oreientation may be wacked.

377
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:47,400
Sorry! I can't.

378
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,760
For now.

379
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:20,620
Delivery!

380
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:26,450
Yes.

381
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:30,110
Can you please sign here?

382
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,000
Thank you so much. Here is your parcel. Bye.

383
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:38,240
I have to work on my assignment.

384
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:41,810
Let's see.

385
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:25,470
♫ I’m drawn into your skin ♫

386
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:32,230
♫ that shines in gold ♫

387
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:37,940
♫ Your sweet sweet kiss ♫

388
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:45,090
♫ malted my body and heart ♫

389
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:51,740
♫ My sweet sweet kindness ♫

390
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:58,450
♫ You muttered “you’re boring" ♫

391
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:04,670
♫ "I want more excitement” ♫

392
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:11,750
♫ You have disappeared somewhere ♫

393
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:18,340
♫ This room without you ♫

394
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:24,880
♫ I feel like my chest is about to collapse ♫

395
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,100
[Preview] 
 I'm looking for a true love.

396
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:29,500
Kiss? Kairi kissed you?

397
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,810
You're not afraid at all?

398
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:31,750
Why would I be?

399
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:34,520
It means you don't mind being a lesbian.

400
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,170
Not anyone can get a true love.

401
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:39,450
You don't want that, Yuri?
