1
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:07,390
You can vent your anger on me.

2
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:09,430
You can do to me whatever you like.

3
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:10,870
Because I'm her bestie.

4
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:12,900
I heard you used to be a junior idol.

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,340
 I met your friend at a convenience store the other day.

6
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:19,250
She said your mother treated you badly and grew up in a poor environment.

7
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:22,280
Why?

8
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,090
What is your relationship with Professor Fuwa?

9
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,690
Did you pour candle wax on Professor and whip him?

10
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:29,050
Don't seduce him into that wanton world of yours.

11
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,900
I can't be your friend anymore.

12
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,250
Was I out of line?

13
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,360
Or not.

14
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:49,000
Subtitles and Timing brought to you by 💋 The Girl Next Door 💋 Team.

15
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,510
- Good morning! 
 - Good morning.

16
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:58,050
I'm still wearing the one-sided love ring.

17
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,080
That topic is too heavy for the morning.

18
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,900
Because...

19
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:05,050
If you want us to be friends again,

20
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:07,620
be sure to end your immoral relationship with Professor Fuwa.

21
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:10,330
At least, you should do that.

22
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:12,640
I can't do that.

23
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,190
Why not?

24
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:17,920
You can pick anyone, like Mr. Miyake.

25
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,240
I think I have a thing for "dried" men.

26
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,450
Tired older men look cute to me.

27
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:26,890
He has a wife, who is in a vegetative state.

28
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,680
The sleeping beauty?

29
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,980
Yeah. I'm asking you not to taint the story.

30
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,050
It's not right to look at only the beauty of the story.

31
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:41,890
It's like licking only the whipped cream and not eat the spongecake.

32
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:45,940
I eat it. It's not a cake if you don't eat the cream with the sponge.

33
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,880
Ah, sorry. It was a bad metaphor.

34
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,190
I'm not feeling well, so I can't think.

35
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:52,900
You drank too much wine.

36
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,750
No.

37
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,120
Kairi?

38
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,790
I'm fine. It's the usual episode.

39
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,890
Episode?

40
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:06,570
It's more like a withdrawal symptom.

41
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:10,200
So you did do drugs.

42
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,710
No. It's not drugs.

43
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:17,000
I get an urge to bite someone before my period.

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,850
- What? 
 - Bite softly.

45
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:19,820
Are you a cat?

46
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,260
A toe...

47
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:26,010
Yuri, please take off your sock and let me bite your toe.

48
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,830
You are joking.

49
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,220
Because I told you to quit being friends,

50
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,450
you are trying to mend our friendship out of sympathy.

51
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:33,770
If that was the case, I would find a better excuse.

52
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,550
I wouldn't ask you to let me bite your little toe.

53
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:38,170
A normal person wouldn't say so, but you are not normal.

54
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:42,290
I am normal. I want three boobs, but I only have two.

55
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:44,190
I have a class.

56
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,070
Don't go! Just a little bit.

57
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:47,860
Take off your sock and I'll put it in my mouth.

58
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,740
Just for a little bit.

59
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,490
Not my business. I'm leaving.

60
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:54,950
Please, Yuri!

61
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:58,460
Yuri, come back!

62
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,650
I'm not doing it!

63
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,170
[Yuri or Another]

64
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:08,610
[Episode 7]

65
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,400
You took off your friendship ring, too?

66
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,250
What? Did something happen with Kairi?

67
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:29,840
I can forgive most things. I'm not perfect, either.

68
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,440
Being best friends means to accept each other's flaws.

69
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:38,190
I mean, the flaws make that person unique and interesting.

70
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,550
So, there was something you could not forgive no matter what.

71
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:43,230
I didn't know there was something even Yuri couldn't forgive.

72
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,330
It's about Professor Fuwa.

73
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,430
What? How does Professor Fuwa come into the picture?

74
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,950
At the restaurant I work at,

75
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:52,090
all seats were taken and I asked Kairi to share a table with Professor Fuwa.

76
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:54,680
It started with a strange coincidence... and?

77
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,670
I told her about his wife and we visited the hospital together.

78
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:01,010
Don't tell me Kairi and Professor Fuwa hooked up.

79
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:03,710
It's not right. It can't happen.

80
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:06,740
She got in between him and his eternally beloved wife.

81
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,960
Dried men chaser or father complex.

82
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,130
They say the girls who grew up in a complicated environment go for older men.

83
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:14,770
It's not about her taste in men.

84
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:16,880
It's Professor Fuwa of all people.

85
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,670
It's filthy. I can't take it.

86
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:24,750
She ruined your beautiful story, I see.

87
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:29,140
It's disappointing that Professor Fuwa fell for Kairi so easily.

88
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:32,150
Right? You guys understand me.

89
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,180
Because we are normal.

90
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:38,670
It's too heavy to date a man who has a wife in a vegetative state.

91
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,680
I'd rather date a flirtatious hot guy.

92
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,830
Are you talking about Shuji?

93
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:45,270
So, you did have your eyes on him behind my back.

94
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:49,160
It's strictly generally speaking.

95
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,490
But some girls are like that.

96
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:53,870
They have the gene for affairs.

97
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:56,190
They can get excited only with someone else's boyfriend.

98
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,010
They are stealers.

99
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:03,400
Yeah. There are such actresses, announcers, and even politicians.

100
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,110
They are the worst. They are breaking the girls' code.

101
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:09,060
It could happen to them, too,

102
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,310
when they introduce their boyfriends to their friends.

103
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,130
You were right to break up the friendship.

104
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:16,330
You have to be firm; otherwise, she will take advantage of you.

105
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:17,830
I know.

106
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,570
She pretended to be sick this morning

107
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:22,000
and asked me to let her bite my toe. It's nonsense.

108
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,650
Bite you? Is she a cat? A thieving cat?

109
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:30,390
But she lives next door. You could move out and cut your ties.

110
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,030
I just moved in there.

111
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:34,830
I don't have money. My parents won't pay for it.

112
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:37,060
Right.

113
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,650
Speaking of which, what happened to the stalker?

114
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:42,100
Did he send something else after the toys?

115
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:46,100
No. There has been nothing lately.

116
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:51,340
I feel that the land will be sold.

117
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,640
Sorry for using your charm,

118
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,580
but the business goes smooth when I bring you with me.

119
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:02,450
I'm joking. Don't say I'm sexually harassing you.

120
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:06,100
Oh, no. What's wrong? Are you okay?

121
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:09,300
I'm sorry. I'm fine. It's just...

122
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,060
What? Do you have anemia?

123
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,340
Hey...

124
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,480
You are bleeding.

125
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,630
I was whipped.

126
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,010
What?

127
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,660
Excuse me.

128
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,550
Yes?

129
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:56,550
Are you Kairi's mom?

130
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,210
Yes.

131
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:03,130
I thought so. Your eyes look alike.

132
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,000
Why did you tell her where I live?

133
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,540
She said she was your mother.

134
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,380
She isn't? She said her name was Mari Ninomiya.

135
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:14,090
She is, but you gave her my personal information.

136
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:17,380
She is my mother, but not all mother-daughter relationships are good.

137
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,930
Hey, hey. You are baffled, right?

138
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:21,900
Come on.

139
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,550
Calm down.

140
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:31,010
Shouldn't you go to the hospital?

141
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:32,960
I'm fine.

142
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,000
That's...

143
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:01,480
a true story.

144
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,410
She got rid of the habit of biting her nails,

145
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:06,850
then started asking to bite my toe!

146
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:09,460
So, it was true.

147
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:13,690
Is she a cat or what? Why would she bite?

148
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:19,200
She is still a baby.

149
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,790
She looks cool and beautiful.

150
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:25,610
Oh, no. Not at all.

151
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:28,200
She's like "meow, meow..."

152
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,640
She is like a cat.

153
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,010
Yuri?

154
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:42,080
Mom...

155
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:44,740
Welcome home.

156
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:17,340
You didn't let her stay overnight?

157
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,210
She went back to the hotel.

158
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:21,410
I guess she'd rather be with her boyfriend.

159
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:24,890
That's not true. If you'd asked her to stay...

160
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:27,060
I wanted her to leave.

161
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:30,360
She is like a stalker.

162
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:34,130
Don't talk about your mom like that.

163
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:37,250
Thanks.

164
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:41,220
She was nothing like you said.

165
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,220
She was elegant and nice,

166
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:46,020
and loves her daughter very much.

167
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,210
She acts nicely on the surface.

168
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,850
She said money isn't important and doesn't want money.

169
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:56,590
She said with tears in her eyes that she was worried about her only child.

170
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,870
Did she?

171
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:01,310
I mean...

172
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:04,010
I think you are pursuing the ideal too hard.

173
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:06,460
You are twisted.

174
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,970
No parent is perfect.

175
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:14,300
I guess I am twisted like crazy.

176
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,650
- You can't show your true self? 
 - Yeah.

177
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,160
You seek affection?

178
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,460
Yeah.

179
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:23,990
You weren't lying about the biting habit.

180
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,750
Maybe I was a cat in my former life.

181
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,100
Meow.

182
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,790
Meow.

183
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:42,020
You took off your friendship ring.

184
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:46,690
I felt stupid wearing it by myself.

185
00:10:55,690 --> 00:11:00,450
So, her stalker was the professor from her class?

186
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:02,820
I kind of feel sorry for him.

187
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,890
His wife has been in a vegetative state for a long time

188
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:08,320
and he's been taking care of her.

189
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,680
He can't talk to her. How pitiful.

190
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,680
Everyone around them makes it a beautiful story.

191
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,240
A sleeping beauty.

192
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:23,330
Especially a pure and kind girl like Yuri.

193
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:25,420
And she does it innocently.

194
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,700
Right.

195
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,450
I think it drove him into a corner,

196
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:31,700
and he took out his mixed feelings of love and hate on her.

197
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,490
He is crazy.

198
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:40,630
It's a crime. Report it to the police.

199
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,240
No.

200
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:47,750
I don't want to ruin Yuri's ideal.

201
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,270
You, too,

202
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:54,080
are crazy.

203
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,570
Are you playing "breaker-uppers" or something?

204
00:11:56,570 --> 00:12:00,530
You are saving her by turning his attention to yourself.

205
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:01,980
Yes.

206
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:07,040
I will receive his anger and sorrow in Yuri's stead.

207
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:14,530
You were not joking about getting whipped.

208
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:17,160
I can tolerate it.

209
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:28,030
Professor.

210
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:30,360
I know...

211
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:36,480
about your relationship with Kairi.

212
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:43,750
Ah...

213
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:47,060
I can understand you feel lonely sometimes.

214
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:51,430
But I don't want you to betray your wife.

215
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,850
I'm sorry.

216
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,370
Your wife is not dead.

217
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:01,980
She's just sleeping.

218
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,790
That's what you said yourself.

219
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:08,470
She might wake up someday because miracles happen.

220
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:12,060
I was moved so much by what you said.

221
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,710
Please break up with Kairi.

222
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,620
I beg you.

223
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:29,850
Can't it be me?

224
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:33,870
What?

225
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:39,630
I will see you sometimes and eat together.

226
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:42,750
Of course, not in an inappropriate manner.

227
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:46,770
Let's start with the story about how you met her.

228
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:51,960
We will always talk about her.

229
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,720
With you?

230
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:59,730
It will not make her jealous.

231
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,880
Isn't it right?

232
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:07,670
With you...

233
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:09,920
Yes.

234
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:33,210
Last place? 
 [20th, Shuji Tanabe]

235
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:35,360
That's right.

236
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,290
Internet voting or SHOWROOM...

237
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:40,460
I have failed both completely.

238
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:43,600
Sorry to hear that.

239
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,890
I guess life isn't that easy

240
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:50,120
I'm going to look for a real job now.

241
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,590
Are you?

242
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,190
Why don't you come over today?

243
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:56,640
There is no reason for us to hide our relationship now.

244
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,660
Are we going to date again?

245
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:03,080
Because you were in last place and you gave up entering the entertainment business.

246
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:08,400
I know I've been selfish.

247
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,480
I apologize for my selfish behaviors that caused you pain.

248
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,500
Please...

249
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,040
take me back even though I'm at the lowest rank.

250
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,090
Sure.

251
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:18,670
What? That was easy.

252
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:22,330
That's because I don't hate you.

253
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:23,740
Are you sure?

254
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:26,920
You sound like you would forgive me even if I'd cheat on you.

255
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:31,230
Well, I guess I'd forgive you if I still loved you.

256
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:34,950
You're generous or stupid?

257
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:36,670
Huh? Who are you calling stupid?

258
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,910
Right. I'm sorry.

259
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:40,900
Thank you so much.

260
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:44,230
Awesome! Great!

261
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:46,680
I...

262
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,980
am forgiving too easily when apologized to.

263
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:55,400
Is this a bad habit?

264
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:58,820
It's a good habit.

265
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,250
Hello.

266
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:20,000
This will be the last time we meet.

267
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,870
Has the fog cleared completely?

268
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,190
I'm happy to hear that.

269
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:27,450
No. The fog...

270
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:31,190
is getting denser than before.

271
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:34,510
To the point, I no longer see myself.

272
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:36,090
What?

273
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:38,440
What we did was only a game.

274
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,400
The emptiness comes back after a game.

275
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,410
But...

276
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:45,630
She promised to meet me alone.

277
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:49,890
- She... Do you mean Yuri? 
 - Yeah.

278
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:53,290
She genuinely wants to be my chat partner.

279
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:56,720
She said my wife wouldn't get jealous.

280
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,960
It was thrilling to hear that.

281
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,430
That means I get to live up to

282
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:06,600
my eternal true love.

283
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,280
What kind of nonsense is that?

284
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,260
Yuri only wants you to maintain the current relationship with your wife.

285
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:13,050
I'm sorry, but you're no longer any use to me.

286
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:15,490
If you hurt Yuri...

287
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:16,990
That sounds scandalous.

288
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:19,950
- I'll report it to the police. 
 - You won't.

289
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:22,850
Because you deeply care about your friend.

290
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,690
Here.

291
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:58,400
Thanks.

292
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:03,120
Please wait.

293
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,160
What did she give you just now?

294
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,090
Was it money?

295
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:11,310
Well, yes.

296
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,190
Yuri...

297
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:15,510
You told me you didn't care about money, didn't you?

298
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:18,510
You were simply worried about your daughter.

299
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:20,680
Did you lie about that?

300
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,410
Well...

301
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:24,960
Kairi,

302
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,880
I'm glad that you've found that good friend.

303
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,970
Please answer me. Did you lie to me?

304
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:37,310
It's wrong to lie in the upright world.

305
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:39,420
But in the corrupt world,

306
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,630
a person who can't lie is plain boring.

307
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:44,510
That does not justify your action.

308
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:47,150
Kairi, why did you give her the money?

309
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:48,710
No matter how many times you sever ties with her...

310
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,800
It's not easy to break the bad habit?

311
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,130
What a hateful way to say it.

312
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:54,490
I'm her mother after all.

313
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:58,080
You surely don't behave like a mother.

314
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,840
Yuri...

315
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:04,840
She doesn't mind it.

316
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:08,910
She wants me

317
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:13,600
or someone to track her down.

318
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,930
She wants to be needed by someone.

319
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:19,880
She runs away

320
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,810
to be found and she runs away again.

321
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:26,770
She wants me to find her. It's like a game to her.

322
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:29,310
Isn't that right, Kairi?

323
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,930
Tell her it's not true.

324
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:36,270
Kairi, tell her she's wrong.

325
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:39,440
So she won't take advantage of you anymore.

326
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:46,640
She's feeling anxious and unstable. I know all too well.

327
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,200
I've been feeling the same way.

328
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,710
She won't be like you.

329
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:05,110
Kairi is going to be fine. She has me.

330
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:08,310
I'll stay by her side from now on and forever.

331
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:10,960
I'll never let her feel anxious.

332
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,660
Oh my.

333
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:15,080
Good for you, Kairi.

334
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,310
But you won't trust her.

335
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:21,090
Because many people have betrayed you.

336
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,810
I won't lie to her.

337
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:29,700
I believe in eternal love and eternal friendship.

338
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:33,640
I'm wearing a friendship ring...

339
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,010
It's proof of our friendship.

340
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,770
Goodbye.

341
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:50,230
Tell her not to come anymore.

342
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:58,710
Mama!

343
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,310
Don't come anymore.

344
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,490
I'll be back...

345
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:22,560
by the time your friend leaves you.

346
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:36,090
I won't leave.

347
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:40,790
I'll never let her be alone!

348
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:00,620
What's wrong with her?

349
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:03,670
She is a horrible mother. Here.

350
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:05,470
Thanks.

351
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:08,230
I am an idiot.

352
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:12,100
I believed everything she told me.

353
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,960
You didn't know better because you're not a liar.

354
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,000
Didn't I tell you about the phishing scam before?

355
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,330
Honest people are easy to be deceived.

356
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:24,540
In other words, they would be deceived because they are honest.

357
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,870
What a terrible world to live in.

358
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:30,460
Why is it so hard for an honest person to live?

359
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:38,580
But I think only honest people

360
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,730
can live a happy life.

361
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:42,730
What?

362
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:45,630
I've realized that after meeting you.

363
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:51,330
A stupid pride takes over my life and I get paranoid.

364
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:53,500
I'm dull to others' feelings,

365
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,210
but my heart is fragile.

366
00:22:57,350 --> 00:23:01,170
I'm horrible at expressing my feelings. I have hysterics.

367
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:05,040
Someone like me will never be happy.

368
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:09,810
After all,

369
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:12,970
I can only love myself.

370
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:17,900
I want to cross over to your side.

371
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:21,840
I want to be honest

372
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:25,670
and speak frankly what's on my mind.

373
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:29,020
Even if someone hurts me,

374
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,840
I want to be a person who does get hurt.

375
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,480
I want to be true to myself.

376
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:46,370
I also...

377
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:51,040
want to love someone more than I love myself.

378
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,570
You can do it.

379
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:58,110
I want to be happy.

380
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,450
You can be happy.

381
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:10,630
Really?

382
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:18,010
I'll be your friend for a lifetime.

383
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:30,380
Hey, where are our rings?

384
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,050
We must wear them right away.

385
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:34,780
We need proof of our friendship.

386
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:41,770
I'm not taking it off again.

387
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:44,170
You were wearing them.

388
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:57,080
For you.

389
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:04,050
In health and in sickness,

390
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:06,540
to love and to cherish,

391
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:09,800
do you swear to love your friend in eternity?

392
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,700
I do.

393
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:25,620
Do you swear, too?

394
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:29,050
I do. I swear.

395
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:44,490
I was wrong. I'm sorry.

396
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:47,850
Should I chu (kiss) you as my apology?

397
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:49,460
I guess not.

398
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:52,930
Only a mouse squeaks "chu," I'm a cat.

399
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:55,260
By the way, I can't stand it any longer.

400
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,660
What?

401
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,990
Take your sock off.

402
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,430
Oh, I get it. The soft-bite that you mentioned.

403
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,160
Don't bite me hard.

404
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,300
Soft, okay? Do it gently.

405
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,930
Gentle bite in your mouth.

406
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:37,110
Subtitles and Timing brought to you by 💋 The Girl Next Door 💋 Team.

407
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:42,630
Ouch! Or not.  It feels good.

408
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:45,620
Then she kills me with the look.

409
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,730
She looks up at me.

410
00:26:53,540 --> 00:27:00,350
♫ I’m drawn into your skin ♫

411

[Preview]
Every story will come to its end eventually.

421
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:07,320
She is not attending her class or answering her phone?

422
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:10,050
Look for her on the entire campus if you have to.

423
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:12,220
So it was you.

424
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,640
What on earth are you doing?

425
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,940
I want her to die with me.
