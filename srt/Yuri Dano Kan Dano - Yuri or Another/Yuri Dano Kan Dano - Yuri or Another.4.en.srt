1
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,280
A sex toy?

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,390
It must be from the stalker.

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:09,160
Now we have a clue about the stalker.

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,830
A person who knows your new apartment.

5
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,440
Kiss? Did Kairi kiss you?

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,230
I knew she is "L". 
 (T/N: Lesbian)

7
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,230
You should choose your friends properly.

8
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:21,240
Beneath the surface, they've been flirting with your boyfriend.

9
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,670
Not everyone can find true love.

10
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:25,800
You don't want that, Yuri?

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,810
I do. I want it.

12
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,200
I want to find true love like the professor's.

13
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,960
I wonder if you caught a cold from me?

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,100
I've been working overtime because of the upcoming exam.

15
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:50,570
I remember you told me about taking a certification exam for a real estate broker.

16
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,720
Right.

17
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,100
Can you eat udon? 
 (T/N: wheat flour noodles)

18
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,060
No appetite.

19
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:59,850
- Next to the fridge. 
 - Hm?

20
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,630
There is a jar of honey.

21
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:09,120
Yeah, there is.

22
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,210
Can you bring it over?

23
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:20,260
Thanks. It's good for a sore throat.

24
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:22,480
Eat it as it is?

25
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,000
Yep, eat it straight.

26
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:27,430
Let me get you a spoon.

27
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:29,440
Just scoop it up with a finger.

28
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:31,230
Finger?

29
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:34,190
Right, with your finger.

30
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:44,030

I want more and more.

00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,530
Okay.

42
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:57,750
I want more and more of you, Yuri.

43
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,500
Dream?

44
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,660
What kind of dream was that?

45
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,100
Oh, good morning.

46
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,690
Morning.

47
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:27,860
What's wrong?

48
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,450
Your face is red. Did you get a fever again?

49
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:32,190
What? No, I didn't.

50
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,910
Let me see.

51
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:37,250
Hey, I said I'm fine.

52
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,360
You sure?

53
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,760
Yes, I'm great.

54
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,260
Oh, no! I'm going to be late.

55
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:47,210
The CEO is a former athlete and he nitpicks about being late.

56
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:48,440
"Are you licking (messing) with me?"

57
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,890
- Licking? 
 - Focus more

58
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:52,050
- on your job! 
 - On licking.

59
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:53,120
What?

60
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,530
Huh?

61
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,230
[Yuri or Another]

62
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:03,820
[Episode 4]

63
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,920
You had a dream?

64
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,280
A dream of you making out with Kairi?

65
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,660
To be exact, I wasn't making out.

66
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,470
She had a cold so I took care of her.

67
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,390
Then she said she wanted to eat honey.

68
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:22,500
You know, honey is good for a sore throat.

69
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,320
And then?

70
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,420
I scooped it up with my finger...

71
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:29,100
She put your finger into her mouth.

72
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,770
You make it sound so dirty.

73
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,770
It was your dream. You're the one with a dirty mind.

74
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:35,030
Don't tell me... Did Kairi

75
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:38,750
lick you up with her tongue and glance up at you?

76
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,590
That's too crazy. That can't be right.

77
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:43,590
I'm sure that's not what happened.

78
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:46,820
- That's what happened. 
 - That's what happened.

79
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,810
It's your desire.

80
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:53,070
A dream is an interpretation of your desire.

81
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:55,300
No way. I don't have that sort of desire.

82
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,670
But didn't she kiss you when you were drunk before?

83
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:01,010
There are some people who kiss a random person when drunk.

84
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:04,060
The kiss caused me to have this crazy dream.

85
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,460
Did something happen after that?

86
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:08,800
No. It was a kiss. Just once.

87
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,500
Are you wishing for more?

88
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,520
That's right. More and more.

89
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,070
More and more?

90
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:16,560
I want more and more...

91
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,220
Stop that.

92
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:21,190
When I hear that, I can't help but stare at Kairi's lips.

93
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,660
You must be interested in the same gender. Because you're Yuri.

94
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,830
No, thanks. I'm straight and earnest.

95
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:30,820
That's it. An earnest person has an immoral desire somewhere in her mind.

96
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,590
You're afraid to lose control, once you step into the world.

97
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:36,010
Forcing yourself to live an earnest life.

98
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:39,530
You're messing with me, aren't you?

99
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:41,860
Either way, you must be sexually frustrated.

100
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:45,490
That's right. I can tell by looking at your boyfriend.

101
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:48,930
You look good. I'm serious. You're really cute.

102
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:51,060
I will send you the photos.

103
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,950
Seriously, he pisses me off.

104
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,370
Thank you for visiting.

105
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:02,580
Not at all. We're just repaying for the dinner you bought the other night.

106
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:05,570
Ah, I forgot about that.

107
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,260
Professor.

108
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,850
I know.

109
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:17,870
She moved her finger because of a vital reaction.

110
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:21,490
The doctor repeatedly reminded me.

111
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:23,460
Did he?

112
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:33,080
Why deny it?

113
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:37,970
It's okay to dream (have hope). Like in a fantasy world.

114
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:40,620
You're interesting.

115
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:43,410
You're right.

116
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,030
A fantasy world...

117
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:50,570
You see. Sometimes,

118
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:54,280
I have a hard time distinguishing

119
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,340
if this reality or a dream.

120
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:03,660
You must be tired, Professor.

121
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,920
When young ladies like you visit,

122
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,690
it brightens up the room.

123
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:14,310
Right.

124
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,710
I'll visit again.

125
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:20,090
Thank you.

126
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,780
I know it's painful for him.

127
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,540
I may sound feckless for saying this.

128
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:32,150
But I think their relationship is mystical.

129
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,750
Mystical?

130
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,770
It's serene.

131
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:39,020
They're at peace and don't argue.

132
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,460
It's eternal love.

133
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,230
They can't argue since she can't even speak.

134
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,830
I know, but...

135
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,990
Sorry.

136
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:50,070
Are you thristy?

137
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,930
Let's drink something.

138
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,940
What do you want to drink?

139
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:57,300
I want...

140
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,390
"Honey and Lemon."

141
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,980
It's good for your throat.

142
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:15,770
- Here. 
 - Thanks.

143
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:17,580
- Do you want to share? 
 - Huh?

144
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,140
I don't think I can finish it all.

145
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,770
Yummy.

146
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,170
Here.

147
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,740
It's an indirect kiss. You might get pregnant.

148
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:44,450
What a childish joke.

149
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:52,160
Geez. We're going to the open house.  Fix your tie already.

150
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,130
Don't you know? All the New Yorkers dress like this.

151
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:56,290
You're full of crap.

152
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:58,340
I'm serious.

153
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,810
Oh, Yuri. Are you going to your part-time job?

154
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,740
Yes.

155
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,720
She is a friend from elementary school.

156
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,600
She stopped by at our agency unexpectedly.

157
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,480
Ah, you must be the stalker victim.

158
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,400
Right.

159
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,610
Chief, let's go.

160
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:16,390
Okay. See you later.

161
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:19,590
I said okay.

162
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:22,230
I think the bottom is getting loose.

163
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:24,260
It's fine. It's a French style.

164
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,390
French?

165
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,550
Thank you very much.

166
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,850
Thank you for coming.

167
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,700
Chief.

168
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,290
Somehow...

169
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,490
I feel frustrated.

170
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,210
Wow! You startled me.

171
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:14,730
Can't you knock?

172
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,180
Tell me.

173
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,490
Do I look handsome with my left profile?

174
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:21,190
The left jawline is sharper than the right. What do you think?

175
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:23,310
It's all your fault.

176
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:25,850
I'm frustrated because of you.

177
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:28,490
My friends told me I'm sexually frustrated.

178
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:29,900
I'm sorry.

179
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:33,570
Be patient till the Junon contest is over.

180
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:37,210
Right. I am a man of self-discipline.

181
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:41,130
What an Idiot. You looked like a dugong when you were fat.

182
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:44,540
Fine. I'll give you a hug,

183
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,930
That's all you're getting for now.

184
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:59,010
How was it? Is that better?

185
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,660
- Crap. 
 - Nice, right?

186
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,660
I'm a handsome guy after all.

187
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,700
I didn't feel anything.

188
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,250
What?

189
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:22,470
Am I a lesbian?

190
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:25,450
No, I love boys.

191
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:28,420
Sounds like I'm reminding myself.

192
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:32,630
Why did my mom name me Yuri? 
 (T/N: yuri=lesbian)

193
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:35,810
I feel like I'm brainwashed.

194
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,870
Someone bumped into me. It's a minor scratch.

195
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:32,110
It could be the stalker.

196
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:33,970
I don't think so.

197
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:37,670
He disappeared when I was on the ground feeling dizzy.

198
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:42,010
He'd seize the opportunity and would have anesthetized me with chloroform,

199
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:45,100
drag me into a restroom at a park.

200
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,650
You're delusional.

201
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:50,210
Right. I am at fault, too.

202
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,170
Because I was fantasizing.

203
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:55,260
- Of what? 
 - Why do you ask?

204
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,790
A man at your agency...

205
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,130
Do you mean Chief Miyake?

206
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:11,340
He is my boss.

207
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:14,920
Isn't he handsome? He is capable of work, too.

208
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,070
- Are you dating him? 
 - What?

209
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,740
You two seemed close.

210
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,120
You were helping him fix his tie.

211
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,310
Oh, that? I was showing off.

212
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:27,930
Showing off?

213
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:31,240
A few female employees at work

214
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,900
have a crush on him.

215
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:36,540
They accused me that I like him and he likes me, too.

216
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,180
They were such a nuisance.

217
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:40,610
I provoked them a little.

218
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:41,970
You're mean.

219
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:47,370
That's right. I can be mean to a person I dislike.

220
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,640
So how do you feel about him?

221
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:57,770
What? Are you interested in Chief, too?

222
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,040
Should I have introduced you properly?

223
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,590
No, I was asking how do you feel about him.

224
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:06,900
Well... Like I said, he's handsome and a capable boss.

225
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,080
That's all?

226
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,480
He's a divorcé. So he learned his lesson.

227
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,190
He said he has no interest in a serious relationship.

228
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:15,480
That's ridiculous.

229
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,940
Is he toying with ladies?

230
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,050
If you still like him after knowing that,

231
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:22,580
means you don't mind being toyed with?

232
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:25,320
A player, or I should say...

233
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,520
a popular guy might do something like that.

234
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:31,530
You don't sound too concerned at all.

235
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:34,280
Wait.

236
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:38,520
Are you asking me if I see him as a man?

237
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,620
That's right.

238
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,380
I don't.

239
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:45,130
You see, I'm disgusted with men, more so than Chief.

240
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:46,190
Disgusted?

241
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:50,170
Men are only interested in a woman's body and look.

242
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:52,690
They may not admit to it, but that's the fact.

243
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:56,100
Good-natured, feminine, and a woman with a good career.

244
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,290
Those are all lip service.

245
00:14:58,290 --> 00:14:59,370
It's sex.

246
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:01,320
Only sex.

247
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,950
I'm sure there are men who think otherwise.

248
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:07,270
Hypothetically speaking, you're married and become a  good mom.

249
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:09,580
Your husband won't have sex with you if you're fat and old.

250
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:12,210
Then he would make a lame excuse like "I can only see you as a mother."

251
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:15,580
That's why all the celeb moms get back in shape after giving birth.

252
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,240
Otherwise, nobody would care to look at them.

253
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:21,470
I know eternal love does exist, just like Professor Fuwa.

254
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:23,010
Fall in love with the sleeping beauty?

255
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:25,260
Don't make fun of him. That's rude.

256
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,000
Okay. You're right.

257
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,610
You would lose dreams and hope.

258
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:34,270
Listen. It's dangerous to seek dreams and hope in love.

259
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:36,900
A relationship is like a festival.

260
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,340
At a climax, fireworks go up.

261
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:43,210
Wow, it's beautiful. See you next year! Just like that.

262
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:45,760
That's a sad way of thinking.

263
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,770
It's self-defense because I've learned from my experience.

264
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:50,710
If my significant other betrays me, I won't recover from the pain.

265
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:52,640
Have you been hurt before?

266
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,220
I'm not someone who is mentally unstable.

267
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,670
So I've never cut my wrist or overdosed.

268
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:57,810
Overdosed?

269
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:00,610
Right. It's a drug overdose.

270
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:02,150
You're very knowledgeable.

271
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:05,030
Only about the ”dark side” (of society).

272
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:07,050
Do you believe in anything?

273
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:10,460
Of course, I do. If not, I'd be mentally unstable for real.

274
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,270
What do you believe in?

275
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,680
Friendship.

276
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,850
People say, a friendship between girls is superficial.

277
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:19,670
I hear that often. Not a phony or makeshift friendship.

278
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:22,480
What I want is a genuine and sparkly friendship.

279
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,720
Meaning?

280
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,980
Let's see...

281
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,530
A friend who prioritizes me over her boyfriend.

282
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:32,140
If her boyfriend and I were to get in a car accident at the same time,

283
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:34,630
she would save me first.

284
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:38,430
What? No. What if you have a boyfriend?

285
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:41,290
I don't need it. I don't need a boyfriend.

286
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:44,360
Is a friend more important than your boyfriend?

287
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,750
I would fall out of love eventually, I'm sure he would, too.

288
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,820
Even If I were to get married out of a whim,

289
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:52,110
I would end up divorcing him.

290
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:55,580
My ideal life would be to live with my best friend.

291
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:59,360
Go on a trip together and stay together till the day I die.

292
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,960
I bet many women have the same idea as mine.

293
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,300
Men and women are different species.

294
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:08,460
I feel more comfortable and at ease being around women.

295
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:11,030
- You do? 
 - This is only an ideal.

296
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:15,010
That would be dreams and hope for me.

297
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:17,020
I don't believe in eternal love,

298
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:19,540
but I do believe in eternal friendship.

299
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,980
Eternal friendship?

300
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,220
There is no one like you who rents their panties you're wearing.

301
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,810
That's because I was wearing pants.

302
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:31,000
Even so, people wouldn't do that normally.

303
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,780
It's normal for me.

304
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:35,280
You may think it's normal. but you're the greatest.

305
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,000
I've never forgotten about that not even a day.

306
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,130
When the memory starts to fade,

307
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:42,800
I put it over my head and smell it.

308
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,650
Perve.

309
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:46,330
It's more perverted to take off your panties and rent them.

310
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:47,530
I guess you're right.

311
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:48,980
You're a perve but a blessed one.

312
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:51,430
Since we're both perverts, should we live together after retirement?

313
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:52,250
Deal!

314
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,650
Just kidding.

315
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:56,990
I intend to get married and became the mother of my kids.

316
00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:00,650
As I said, I will wait till you get a divorce at your old age.

317
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:03,310
I don't want to get married with divorce in mind.

318
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:05,320
That's true.

319
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,410
- I should get going. 
 - Leaving?

320
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:11,170
I have to study.

321
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:13,230
That's right. Thanks.

322
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:15,600
Goodnight.

323
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,570
Wait, Kairi.

324
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:24,240
What about a good night kiss?

325
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,340
Huh? What was that?

326
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:39,160
It gave me a chill when you say that with a serious look.

327
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,880
Well...

328
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,740
You were joking, right?

329
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:47,340
By chance, you like lesbians?

330
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,740
No.

00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:53,270
Fantasizing... Did you fantasize about us making out?

332
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:56,350
It was just a dream.

333
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:58,240
Did you dream about me?

334
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,940
Scary. A dream is an interpretation of a desire.

335
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,890
Sorry.

336
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:05,150
It gives me a chill.

337
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:09,180
I'm sorry. Don't hate me.

338
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:14,120
I feel that I'm not myself lately.

00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:36,680
- Just kidding. 
 - Kairi.

341
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:40,940
I'm so happy, Yuri. I love you.

342
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,780
Goodnight.

343
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,530
Goodnight.

344
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:33,520
Yes?

345
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:44,580
Hello. You're here again.

346
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:47,520
Yes.

347
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,730
Where is your friend?

348
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:53,340
Yuri is injured.

349
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,230
But nothing serious.

350
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:58,690
Oh, I'm relieved to hear that.

351
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:04,420
A person on a bicycle ran into her from behind.

352
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:07,210
That's terrible.

353
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:14,770
It was you, right? The perpetrator.

354
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:31,770
♫ I’m drawn into your skin ♫

355
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:38,600
♫ that shines in gold ♫

♫ Your sweet sweet kiss ♫

357
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,010
It's sweet.

♫ My sweet sweet kindness ♫

359
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:04,790

00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:11,030

367
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,320
Glabrous?

368
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,690
You must care a lot about your friend.

369
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:07,180
We are besties.

370
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:10,270
If she finds out your true color, she would be devastated.

371
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:12,040
I don't want me to appologize to her.

372
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,730
Then what do I do now?
