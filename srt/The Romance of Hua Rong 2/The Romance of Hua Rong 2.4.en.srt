3
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:42,500
The waterbed is so comfortable!

4
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:50,190
Don't mess it up.

5
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:50,830
Get down!

6
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,759
It's hard to get down,

7
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,190
but it's really comfortable.

8
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:55,910
You know,

9
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:57,950
this waterbed,

10
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,000
with the soft water

11
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,270
and smooth silk,

12
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:01,270
is a masterpiece

13
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:02,720
that has never been made before and after.

14
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,510
I can tell you

15
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,160
you and her highness will have a wonderful life

16
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,510
in this bed.

17
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,320
Rong has been practicing so hard in recent days,

18
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,830
so I added many herbs

19
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,080
into the waterbed,

20
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,520
which can not only help her sleep,

21
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,110
but also relax her muscles
and stimulate her blood circulation.

22
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:19,829
That's the way you are.

23
00:02:19,829 --> 00:02:20,360
Perfect!

24
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:21,550
My Lord,

25
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,960
this waterbed is full of water.

26
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,600
What if you and her highness

27
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,829
accidentally break it

28
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:26,550
while sleeping at night?

29
00:02:26,829 --> 00:02:28,079
Are you silly?

30
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,000
How can the bed made by our lord

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,440
just be accidentally broken?

32
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,320
Did we just break it?

33
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,829
Understand? Tidy it up!

34
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:42,440
What's this?

35
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,550
Must be a love letter from our lord

36
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,600
Could you use your head to think,

37
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:45,960
Zhang Xian?

38
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,829
Not from me.

39
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:56,800
Qin Shangcheng

40
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:58,600
Haven't seen you for three years.
Hope that you are well.

41
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,960
I'll go to the island to catch you today.

42
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,360
Be prepared to be my husband!

43
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,360
Chi Hong.

44
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,630
Chi Hong?

45
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,080
Chi Hong!

46
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,520
How did she get in here?

47
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:10,240
No, no.

48
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,360
My Lord,

49
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:13,440
she can do anything out of expectation.

50
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,000
We can't let her highness know this thing.

51
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,800
What are you three doing secretly in the room?

52
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:20,470
Qin Shangcheng!

53
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:21,240
Your highness.

54
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,750
What are you three doing here?

55
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,670
Zhang Xian prepared a present for you

56
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:26,550
and asked our lord to check.

57
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:26,960
We are leaving!

58
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:28,270
See you.

59
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,390
Qin Shangcheng

60
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,270
Aren't you training at the drill ground?

61
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:33,600
Why did you come here?

62
00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:35,630
I just stopped by

63
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,440
to give you a small gift.

64
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,829
What's this?

65
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,750
I know you must have been so busy
in planning the wedding

66
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,800
that you couldn't rest.

67
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:48,320
I made a special sachet to relax your mind.

68
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,829
Thank you.

69
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,000
Just as my lord expected.

70
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,880
It's not a proposal letter.

71
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,159
They came for the treasure.

72
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,270
Arrest them all!

73
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:45,640
We surrender!

74
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:48,760
You are sensible.

75
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,390
My Lord,

76
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:53,830
Dayou was knocked unconscious!

77
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,110
Something happened to Miss Hua!

78
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:58,040
Keep them here!

79
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,200
Chi Hong

80
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,200
Haven't seen you for three years.

81
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,440
You King Pirate

82
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,720
are still attractive.

83
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,110
Where is Rong?

84
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,760
Don't worry.

85
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,390
I kept Miss Hua Rong in the cell

86
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,600
and served her with food and drink.

87
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,270
She'll be fine

88
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,640
as long as you behave well.

89
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,320
What do you want?

90
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,160
We get married.

91
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,390
We make a treaty.

92
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,950
You have me.

93
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,440
I have you.

94
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,200
I don't want Hua Rong to marry you.

95
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,110
Divorce with her.

96
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,270
No way.

97
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,950
Then I'll do.

98
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,670
From now on

99
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,440
you will be free with Hua Rong.

100
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,510
Since then

101
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,390
all of you

102
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:00,760
will be mine.

103
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:04,480
It will hold you with me.

104
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,640
Just a word of warning.

105
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:08,880
If you destroy it,

106
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,670
Hua Rong will die.

107
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:17,480
I like your tough guy spirit.

108
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,000
Like a rebellious eagle,

109
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,160
I can not help but want to tame you.

110
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,390
If you hurt...

111
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,230
The only person you can marry is me.

112
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:30,160
I'll give you a perfect wedding

113
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,270
you'll never forget.

114
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:55,480
Nice.

115
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:17,070
Qin Shangcheng

116
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,600
how do you know it's me?

117
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,640
After feel the unique touch,

118
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,200
how can I don't know?

119
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:36,520
But I have to praise you.

120
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,520
The green herbs in the sachet you gave me

121
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,590
are non-toxic,

122
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:40,840
but if they mix with balloon flower,

123
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,710
they're a real magic drug.

124
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,760
This is Poison of Stacking Incense

125
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,030
used by Tang Chudie.

126
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,550
You have only seen it once

127
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:48,590
and you can use it.

128
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:50,200
Worthy of the title of woman warrior.

129
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,880
Then why didn't you expose me

130
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,350
when you knew it?

131
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:01,590
I will do

132
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:03,640
whatever you want.

133
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,880
Aren't you just trying to

134
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,200
get back at me for marrying you
without your permission?

135
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,590
I supported you.

136
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,030
Then why were you just going back on it?

137
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,320
It is the most important moment

138
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,400
of my life.

139
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,590
I still want to

140
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,000
be honest with you

141
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,590
and get married

142
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,150
officially.

143
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,590
Then I'll give you what you want.

144
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:33,590
You can come out!

145
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:42,280
Congratulations!

146
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,030
Congratulations to Miss Hua and My Lord!

147
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:43,760
Congratulations to your highness!

148
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,880
Congratulations to Qin!

149
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,640
Qian Dayou

150
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,590
you've got something.

151
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,520
No, no, no.

152
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,320
At first,

153
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,640
we also don't know.

154
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,550
Qin Shangcheng

155
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:57,320
Don't blame them.

156
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,280
I got them to cooperate with me

157
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,400
after I made you fainted.

158
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:00,550
Three days to

159
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,470
the one-year anniversary of
my escape from the wedding.

160
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:04,710
The last wedding was a pity for him.

161
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:05,880
So this time

162
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,550
I'm gonna give him

163
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,790
a perfect wedding he'll never forget.

164
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:10,710
Good luck!

165
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:11,350
Good luck!

166
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:13,840
Let's do it!

167
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:20,790
You didn't just start preparing for this

168
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,910
three days ago.

169
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,000
I did prepare a lot before.

170
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:28,470
My mother and her people believed in the sea.

171
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,440
This is a wedding only for the Mermaid Tribe.

172
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:32,230
So,

173
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,000
If we follow

174
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,230
the age-old custom,

175
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:36,670
we will be blessed by the god of the sea.

176
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,550
Qin Shangcheng

177
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,080
You were born by the sea

178
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:41,080
and lived by the sea.

179
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,000
Then I'll be a mermaid

180
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,030
at your side.

181
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,840
So we can find each other

182
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,760
no matter what we go through,

183
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,960
wherever we drift.

184
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:53,470
Marrying you as my wife,

185
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,400
I ask for nothing.

186
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,280
Congratulations!

187
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:02,080
Congratulations!

188
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,110
Well,

189
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:05,000
the bride and groom take your places.

190
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,960
Walk the flower road hand in hand.

191
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,440
Love each other for the rest of life.

192
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,200
Lift the bead curtain together.

193
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,150
The match is ordained by fate.

194
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,110
You are a perfect pair!

195
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,400
Come.

196
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,880
The ceremony officially began!

197
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,590
First, bow to the heaven and the earth.

198
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:54,200
Bravo!

199
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:57,110
Second, bow to the parents.

200
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,670
The bride and groom bow to each other.

201
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,350
All right, the ceremony is over.

202
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:22,640
The groom kisses the bride.

203
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,320
Kiss!

204
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,400
Kiss! Kiss!

205
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,000
Excuse me!

206
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:43,960
My Lord

207
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:45,230
The Emperor of Tianchu has sent his men here!

208
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:47,640
What's wrong?

209
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,470
Uncle

210
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:03,670
What are you doing here?

211
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,910
Hua Rong, answer the imperial edict!

212
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,350
From the God's blessings,
behold the message of the emperor that

213
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:19,710
The daughter of General Hua Mantian named Hua Rong

214
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:20,960
is considerate and gentle,

215
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,320
and has outstanding appearance.

216
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:24,710
Now that Tianchu and South Desolation

217
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:26,910
have signed a peace treaty,

218
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,400
Hua Rong is hereby granted a marriage with

219
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,150
Duanmu Bai, the heir of Mu Palace in South Desolation,

220
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:34,320
to cement the alliance between the two countries.

221
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,110
It is a matter of great importance.

222
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,880
Hua Rong is ordered to leave for the South Desolation
two days later for the marriage

223
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:47,150
with a dowry of the treasures of the previous dynasty
that you have accidentally acquired.

224
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,350
Respect it!

225
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:51,440
Uncle

226
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:52,790
What's the matter?

227
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,880
These are Duanmu Qincang's

228
00:14:58,350 --> 00:14:59,880
conditions for withdrawal and peace talks.

229
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,710
The General was against it,

230
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:03,840
but the emperor...

231
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,910
The General can't disobey the emperor.

232
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:11,470
Hua Rong

233
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:13,230
Take the imperial edict quickly!

234
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,200
Why should her highness marry

235
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,520
the shit heir?

236
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,230
And even with treasure!

237
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,110
Are you crazy?

238
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:19,760
How dare you!

239
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,000
How dare you speak this in front of
the imperial edict!

240
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,520
Qin Shangcheng

241
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,150
How dare you disobey the imperial edict!

242
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,000
Guards, come in!

243
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,520
Arrest him!

244
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,790
Are you rebelling?

245
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,440
Are you rebelling?

246
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,030
This is my place.

247
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,550
You can only find

248
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:11,710
my guards.

249
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:19,910
Here is my wife's Huarong Island

250
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,910
that doesn't belong to Tianchu.

251
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:25,350
Don't say you're just one of
the emperor's minions.

252
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,000
Even if the Emperor of Tianchu
himself came today,

253
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:30,910
he could not stop my wedding with Rong.

254
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:32,640
Zhang Xian!

255
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:33,840
Here.

256
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,110
Take them to other rooms!

257
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:36,470
Yes!

258
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,880
- What are you doing?
- Go!

259
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,030
Leave me alone!

260
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,640
- Leave me alone!
- Go!

261
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:48,400
As for you,

262
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:49,400
uncle,

263
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:52,000
I'll give you a nice room

264
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:54,080
for my father-in-law's sake.

265
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,400
Dayou.

266
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:57,640
Please, uncle.

267
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:06,800
My Lord, you are awesome.

268
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:14,589
Rong

269
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,160
Don't worry.

270
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,710
I have my own solutions.

271
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,710
In this world,

272
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:21,069
there's nobody

273
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,430
and nothing

274
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,760
can stop me from marrying you.

275
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:31,920
Well, now that the ceremony is all done,

276
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,560
then

277
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,710
is it time for

278
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,070
the bridal chamber?

279
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,190
None of your business.

280
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:48,000
Hurry.

281
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,160
I think our bridal chamber is over there.

282
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:54,760
Look over there.

283
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,040
These are

284
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,680
fireflies.

285
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,680
In the legend of the Mermaid Tribe,

286
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,830
the glow of fireflies

287
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,310
is a blessing from the ocean.

288
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:10,280
So

289
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,950
if we can see the glow

290
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:13,310
on our wedding day,

291
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,400
the rest of our married life

292
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:16,760
will be beautiful

293
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,520
and brilliant.

294
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,640
I feel your heart.

295
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:24,000
Open the sachet I gave you.

296
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:29,560
On our wedding night,

297
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,470
wouldn't it be lonely for you

298
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,800
to make me fainted?

299
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,230
Don't say that!

300
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:35,590
Open it.

301
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,190
We get married.

302
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,950
We make a treaty.

303
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:53,280
Good marriage for forever.

304
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,310
Matched couple for forever.

305
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:55,800
We swear to the red leaves.

306
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,040
We swore we'll always be together.

307
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,400
We wrote our vows on paper.

308
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,560
As a witness of our eternal love.

309
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,680
We want to be an immortal couple.

310
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:03,160
Like mandarin ducks and butterflies.

311
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:05,110
Here are the words.

312
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,110
So that's why you tore up the marriage papers

313
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,640
during the day.

314
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:13,680
Certainly.

315
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,950
I am who I am.

316
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,400
I don't know that woman.

317
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,560
You kept that letter like a treasure.

318
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,710
Of course, I'm going to destroy it.

319
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,430
Nice job.

320
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,520
Qin Shangcheng

321
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:25,590
This time

322
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:27,110
I'm most willing to marry you.

323
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,520
Sign this paper

324
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,560
and we'll be officially married.

325
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:47,680
It's a love shape.

326
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,800
You thought of this in advance?

327
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:51,350
Do I have to think about it?

328
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,520
Your name

329
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,110
is always in my heart.

330
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:58,710
The glow is my witness.

331
00:19:59,110 --> 00:19:59,950
Heaven and earth hear my vows.

332
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:03,470
I, Qin Shangcheng, will always

333
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,040
be with you, Hua Rong.

334
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:09,880
By the way, dear,

335
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,430
I'm thinking

336
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,400
maybe you still owe me a

337
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,160
wedding gift.

338
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:18,800
Isn't my gift enough?

339
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:21,070
Since you didn't prepare,

340
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:22,310
I'll punish you for your life.

341
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,070
Let's go.

342
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,520
Wait a minute.

343
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
The bridal chamber I prepared is over there.

344
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:31,520
Let's go.

345
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:44,920
This is

346
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:47,070
the waterbed.

347
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,430
I cannot waste the gift

348
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:51,760
my husband gave me.

349
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,470
You little mermaid

350
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:57,280
fit perfectly with this waterbed.

351
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,430
I'll appreciate

352
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:00,310
this gift.

353
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,590
Wait a minute.

354
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,040
Look,

355
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,430
This pair of mermaid jade pendants

356
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:15,880
are left by my mom.

357
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:17,190
She told me

358
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:19,110
to give it to the one I love the most.

359
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:21,280
And now I give you this half.

360
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:22,800
The spirit of my mom

361
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,040
will protect us.

362
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,190
That's the token of love

363
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:30,590
given by my mother-in-law.

364
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,590
I would cherish it.

365
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:35,350
And I will never fail her baby girl.

366
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:37,830
But in this beautiful place,

367
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,470
I'm sure we have more important things to do.

368
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:13,830
Itch.

369
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,520
Qin Shangcheng

370
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,880
What are you doing?

371
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,800
You are shy.

372
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:32,880
I didn't freshen up

373
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,430
this morning.

374
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,000
What a way

375
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
to look disheveled.

376
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,040
Rong

377
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:42,680
You don't have to worry about the red tape.

378
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:44,000
You can do whatever you want

379
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,280
on Huarong Island.

380
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,560
You do not have to restrain your temper

381
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,800
in Tianchu or all the world.

382
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,350
What you want,

383
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,470
what you want to do,

384
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,520
that's discipline

385
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:54,560
that's propriety.

386
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,280
Besides,

387
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:57,640
I just love it

388
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,830
when you're disheveled.

389
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:01,830
Shouldn't you be practicing Kungfu?

390
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:02,920
What time is it?

391
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,830
You're still in the bed.

392
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,950
The night is short, and the sun is rising.

393
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:11,310
From then on, the king doesn't hold his morning court.

394
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,680
You are so naughty.

395
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,430
What are you doing?

396
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,430
Draw a circle in my wife's hand

397
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,560
and hold your hand forever.

398
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:28,680
Qin Shangcheng.

399
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:30,880
Well,

400
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:32,110
what are you going to do

401
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,280
about the Lord Yu?

402
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,470
Of course send them back.

403
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:39,760
But after all, we are disobeying the imperial edict.

404
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,470
I'm still scared.

405
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:41,190
Rong

406
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:43,000
Don't worry.

407
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:45,000
I'll take care of it.

408
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,350
But this thing it is...

409
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:47,950
Rong,

410
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:48,760
dear,

411
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:50,110
go get dressed first.

412
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,040
I'll make breakfast for you.

413
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:51,710
Love you.

414
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,520
Qin Shangcheng

415
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:11,710
Mrs. Island Lord

416
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,470
Island Lord didn't allow

417
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:14,920
anyone to enter.

418
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,310
I will be responsible for any problems.

419
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:17,920
Get out of my way!

420
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,000
Uncle

421
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,040
Rong

422
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,160
You finally come.

423
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:29,470
I saw you hesitate to say something

424
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:30,560
about the marriage yesterday,

425
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,800
are you still hiding something?

426
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:36,280
In fact, we've been at a disadvantage

427
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,000
in the war against the South Desolation.

428
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,680
If a truce is not negotiated,

429
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:41,190
Tianlu City will fall

430
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:42,470
sooner or later.

431
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,160
But didn't the South Desolation offer peace talks

432
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,470
because of the lack of provisions?

433
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,590
The General speculated that

434
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:51,830
South Desolation agreed to negotiate

435
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,350
because

436
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:55,830
their emperor felt uneasy about their commander

437
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:57,800
Duanmu Qingcang made too much achievement.

438
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:59,280
Now the bridegroom Nie Yuan

439
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:00,430
was captured in the South Desolation.

440
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:02,760
Our emperor wanted to negotiate

441
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,430
an exchange of hostages.

442
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,760
And the hostage to be exchanged

443
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:07,470
is just the only son of Duanmu Qingcang,

444
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:08,470
Duanmu Bai.

445
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:09,760
To our surprise,

446
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,400
he is very ambitious.,

447
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:13,350
in addition to the exchange of hostages,

448
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:15,400
he also asked the royal intermarriage,

449
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,110
with the treasures of the previous dynasty.

450
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,710
But now that Qin Shangcheng

451
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:23,040
has destroyed the imperial edict.

452
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,400
Is there a remedy?

453
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:25,400
Yes,

454
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:27,560
but it has to be done fast.

455
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,680
The diplomatic corps

456
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:30,190
could reach the island today.

457
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,230
General Hua Rong, a disaster is imminent!

458
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:37,830
What's happening?

459
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,880
Here comes the heir, who will marry you.

460
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:51,640
Qin, you live up to your reputation.

461
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:54,230
You kind of surprised me, too.

462
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:55,590
I try peaceful means before resorting to force.

463
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:58,110
If you still want to stop me,

464
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:58,760
I

465
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,040
won't show you any mercy.

466
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,470
Don't forget

467
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,800
you are in my place.

468
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,310
I decide

469
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:12,280
if you're a hostage or an heir.

470
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,040
Fine.

471
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,350
Show me.

472
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,000
Stop!

473
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,680
It's a misunderstanding.

474
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,880
Your Highness.

475
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:27,800
I was so busy

476
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,230
that I was late.

477
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:30,880
Please forgive me.

478
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,950
This is Qin Shangcheng, the Island Lord.

479
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:36,710
This is...

480
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:38,230
I guess,

481
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:39,160
you

482
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:41,710
are the daughter of General Hua Mantian,

483
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:42,710
Hua Rong.

484
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:43,280
Right.

485
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:45,800
Just as everyone is here,

486
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,310
I'd like to introduce you

487
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,040
that she is my...

488
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:50,520
Aunt.

489
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,590
The bridegroom becomes nephew.

490
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:02,000
The bride becomes aunt.

491
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,310
Let me introduce you that,

492
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,040
yes,

493
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:08,470
I'm the daughter of General Hua Mantian, Hua Rong.

494
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,920
This is my,

495
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:13,310
my distant nephew.

496
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,590
He grew up learning Kungfu from my dad.

497
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,950
Because of his excellent Kungfu,

498
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:18,110
he was arranged

499
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:19,800
in my side as guards

500
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,680
to protect me.

501
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:30,920
I didn't know

502
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:34,000
our General Hua Rong and Island Lord Qin

503
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,400
had a history like this.

504
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:37,760
Perhaps it is fate!

505
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,430
Let me introduce you officially.

506
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,190
This is the heir of South Desolation,

507
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:45,040
Duanmu Bai.

508
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:48,000
Qin and Duanmu,

509
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:51,560
you two may be no discord no concord.

510
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,880
It was just a misunderstanding.

511
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,920
In this way,

512
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:56,430
in the future,

513
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:58,710
I will be your uncle.

514
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:07,190
Qin Shangcheng

515
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:08,230
Look at the big picture.

516
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:09,590
I'll explain it to you later.

517
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:10,520
Please.

518
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:13,710
Zhang Xian.

519
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:14,230
Here.

520
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:15,280
Duanmu is tired after the long trip.

521
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,640
Take him to rest.

522
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,760
That's nice.

523
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,070
Please have a rest, my lord.

524
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,040
The diplomatic corps will depart to

525
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,040
South Desolation tomorrow.

526
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,920
Enjoy your time.

527
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:28,950
Your Highness,

528
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:29,520
please.

529
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:37,110
I am

530
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,400
leaving now.

531
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:39,110
Please.

532
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:40,760
Please.

533
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:47,040
Qin...

534
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,190
Okay,

535
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:55,520
he is mad at me.

536
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:03,920
I have two things to tell you before we set out.

537
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:05,520
Listen carefully.

538
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:07,000
First,

539
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:09,590
I must be in full charge of the diplomatic corps

540
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,520
to ensure her safety.

541
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,000
Second,

542
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:15,760
The treasures of the previous dynasty were
supposed to be distributed to the people,

543
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:18,160
but now they become dowries.

544
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:18,920
Then,

545
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,110
the emperor has to give the people

546
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:23,350
the same amount of money to subsidize them

547
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,710
and exempt them from taxes for a year.

548
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:28,710
And also,

549
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,400
we'll take our own boat.

550
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,830
We don't like taking your boat

551
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:32,710
which is small and stifling.

552
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:33,230
Alright?

553
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:34,640
Yes.

554
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:35,310
Yes.

555
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:37,950
I have the

556
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:39,040
official documents and customs clearance ready.

557
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:47,310
My Lord, no problem.

558
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,110
Although your return trip is against the wind,

559
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:52,560
with the undercurrent surging and waves towering,

560
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,950
Your careless may cause you to
fall into the sea to feed sharks,

561
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:55,710
but,

562
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,280
according to this map we give you,

563
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,470
we will ensure that you return
to Tianchu smoothly.

564
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,950
Thanks for your help.

565
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:06,000
I'll go first.

566
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:19,350
Dear,

567
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:25,710
don't be upset.

568
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:26,710
I'll take you somewhere.

569
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,110
Let's go.

570
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:33,400
Follow me.

571
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,230
Come.

572
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:44,640
Look, Qin Shangcheng.

573
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,160
Is the sunset nice here?

574
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,680
Qin Shangcheng

575
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:52,400
Are you still angry?

576
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,920
Don't worry.

577
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:55,280
I'll not marry that

578
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,760
fool heir, Duanmu Bai.

579
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:58,590
Besides, his purpose is not me.

580
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,040
South Desolation has claimed that

581
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,400
the dowry should be the treasures
of the previous dynasty.

582
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:04,520
That means they're after the treasure.

583
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:07,280
You are my husband.

584
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,590
My husband

585
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:11,470
is the great King Pirate,

586
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:13,000
and also the Swordman Yunhe

587
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
admired by all women.

588
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:16,470
How can I part with you?

589
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:21,680
Fine.

590
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,310
Then keep angry.

591
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,400
I will draw my circle in your hand.

592
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:27,190
So you can't get away from me.

593
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:34,560
Why didn't you tell me before you act?

594
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:37,070
I was gonna tell you about this.

595
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,350
But you didn't give me a chance this morning.

596
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,560
I told you

597
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,640
I would take care of this.

598
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,640
I wanted you to trust me.

599
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,640
Why didn't you?

600
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,520
I learned from uncle this morning

601
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:48,000
that the war is critical.

602
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,160
So if this peace talk fails,

603
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,190
it's only a matter of time before Tianlu City falls.

604
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:53,280
I do like adventure

605
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,400
and help the weak.

606
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:56,040
But it doesn't mean I like war.

607
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:57,230
Now there's a way

608
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:58,000
to save the two countries

609
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,470
from war.

610
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,280
So I'd give it a shot.

611
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,430
But from the minute you said yes,

612
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:05,400
our marriage will be hidden from the world.

613
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:07,110
If you're mad

614
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:08,050
because

615
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:09,070
I called you my nephew,

616
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,280
then I apologize.

617
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,110
But I know you know me.

618
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:14,350
You understand me.

619
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:16,520
So can we put aside our pride

620
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,560
and affection

621
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,560
for a moment?

622
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:21,590
Am I just a man

623
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,470
who cares only about pride

624
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:25,470
and affection in your eyes?

625
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:27,160
No.

626
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:28,280
Qin Shangcheng

627
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,230
Qin Shangcheng

628
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,430
I didn't mean that.

629
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:46,640
I give this to you.

630
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:48,040
What's this?

631
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:48,470
A bell.

632
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,950
I'll be right in front of you

633
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:52,830
as soon as you shake it.

634
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:53,800
Really?

635
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:55,470
Let's try.

636
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:02,680
It's good!

637
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,000
You are wonderful.

638
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,280
Qin Shangcheng

639
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,360
Where are you?

640
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,670
I'm ringing the bell.

641
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:33,630
A liar.

642
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:30,950
Hey, guys, handle with care.

643
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:32,000
These things are quite valuable.

644
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,360
These are treasures of the previous dynasty.

645
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:51,040
Pearl?

646
00:35:59,040 --> 00:35:59,840
What are you doing?

647
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,360
This is the dowry.

648
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:05,230
I advise you

649
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,870
to pull yourself together

650
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:07,710
and make a proper package.

651
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:08,470
Moreover,

652
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,120
don't try to steal anything.

653
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:12,600
After we go back to South Desolation,

654
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,360
the heir will have someone take an inventory.

655
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,080
If we find the absence of anything,

656
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,710
which affects the royal intermarriage,

657
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,080
you can't afford it.

658
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,710
Are you serious?

659
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:22,390
This is our home.

660
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:23,320
These treasures are ours, too.

661
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,910
Do I need to steal?

662
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:25,710
Could you figure out

663
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:27,230
who is in charge of the diplomatic corps?

664
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:28,360
I...

665
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,230
Don't worry.

666
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:32,910
These treasures

667
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,430
belong to you.

668
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,430
I'll keep it safe for you

669
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:37,760
on the way.

670
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:39,080
Thanks a lot.

671
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,120
Let's go.

672
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:46,520
My Lord,

673
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,360
what kind of tactic is this?

674
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,560
Some people

675
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,600
are about to show their tails.

676
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:53,760
Hurry up.

677
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,390
Go on board an hour later.

678
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:55,840
Okay.

679
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,230
Be careful, Hui.

680
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,840
Hui

681
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,190
Thanks for coming to see me off.

682
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:07,000
I'll miss you.

683
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:09,910
How could Qin

684
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:11,230
leave you alone

685
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:12,870
on your second night as a newlywed?

686
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,430
So

687
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:20,670
my premarital anxiety was reasonable.

688
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:22,040
All men are like that.

689
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,040
Rong

690
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,360
Don't worry too much.

691
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,470
Qin loves you very much.

692
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,390
I guess

693
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:29,670
he must be embarrassed,

694
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:30,560
so he doesn't know

695
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,600
how to face you.

696
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:33,670
But I don't think so.

697
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,040
I think he's really angry this time.

698
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:37,520
He's never

699
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,800
been out all night before.

700
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:41,840
We just got married,

701
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,190
what should I do in the future?

702
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:45,600
Rong

703
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:46,840
In fact,

704
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,280
the married life

705
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:49,910
also needs to be managed.

706
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:51,280
In particular,

707
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,320
new husband

708
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,520
needs be tamed gradually.

709
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,430
How?

710
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:05,150
Thirty-six Stratagems for Taming Husband

711
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:06,760
This is

712
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:08,670
the most popular book

713
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:09,840
among married women in recent years.

714
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,870
It's in hot demand.

715
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:12,190
I paid a lot of money

716
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:13,360
to get it.

717
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,280
Really?

718
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,470
I can't go to South Desolation

719
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:18,670
with you.

720
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:20,950
Let it take my place

721
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:22,080
to accompany you

722
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,000
on the way.

723
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,910
You are so nice.

724
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,190
I don't understand,

725
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:48,870
Rong.

726
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,280
Qin has prepared the wedding.

727
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,000
Why did you secretly

728
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,150
call us here to discuss it?

729
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,760
As you know,

730
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,520
last time in Mingzhou City,

731
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,520
I had assumed he was tired of me firstly,

732
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,230
and then made he back down many times

733
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:03,600
due to my fear of having baby.

734
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:04,950
So this time,

735
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:06,600
I want to make up for him.

736
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,230
Five days to

737
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:10,520
the one-year anniversary of
my escape from the wedding.

738
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,840
I know the last wedding

739
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,430
was a pity for him.

740
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:17,280
I just want to give him a perfect wedding.

741
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:20,000
Got it.

742
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:23,950
How about you

743
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:24,520
escape from the wedding again?

744
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:29,950
This is Island Lord.

745
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,560
This is you.

746
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,950
Escape first,

747
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:36,150
and then show up at an important moment,

748
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,080
with flowers and silks,

749
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,710
and gongs and drums as the BGM.

750
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:41,470
Such a big surprise

751
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:44,120
is sure to sweep away his doubts.

752
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:47,040
Forget it.

753
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:50,000
I'm afraid that Qin Shangcheng can't accept it,

754
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,120
and it will only make things worse

755
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,280
and make him more hopeless than ever.

756
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,470
No, no.

757
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:54,600
Hui, what do you think?

758
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:56,080
I think

759
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:57,670
you two can

760
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,950
find a romantic place with no one.

761
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,600
Swear to heaven and earth.

762
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,710
Swear to mountains and seas.

763
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,430
Hand in hand all this life.

764
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,910
Love each other forever.

765
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:07,950
Please, Hui!

766
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:09,190
About your wedding to Zhang Xian,

767
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:10,710
I can recite it backwards.

768
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:12,150
This time I want to play a different game

769
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:13,520
with Qin Shangcheng.

770
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:16,280
Neither of our ideas works.

771
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:17,560
Rong

772
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,390
What's your idea?

773
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,630
If I could figure it out,

774
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:21,840
why would I ask you?

775
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,630
Qin Shangcheng

776
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:28,150
What should I do?

777
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:37,710
It is not known who Swordman Yunhe
eventually falls in love with.

778
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:39,230
Now three years have passed,

779
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,670
Chi Hong wants to take him away by force.

780
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:44,230
Got it!

781
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,950
Let's do something exciting this time

782
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:48,870
that he'll never forget.
