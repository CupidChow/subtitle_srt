3
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:37,720
Your permission!

4
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:40,720
Your Majesty,

5
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,759
the front-line troops besieging Xunyang,

6
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,400
Shaoguan and Rongcheng

7
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,630
are trapped by the Tianchu army.

8
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,190
What?

9
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,190
As I said before,

10
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:50,080
the battlefield report has not been sent back,

11
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,550
and everything has not been decided.

12
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:52,630
Your Majesty,

13
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:53,870
you lose.

14
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,870
It is impossible.

15
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,040
How did you find out?

16
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,680
I think this thing

17
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,000
goes too smooth.

18
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,270
I know Duanmu Qingcang.

19
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,389
He is suspicious

20
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:11,360
and cautious.

21
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,190
He let me go so easily,

22
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,110
and let me connect with the Night-Wolf easily

23
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,079
to get the information.

24
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,030
Something must be wrong.

25
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:21,079
But if the information is false,

26
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,829
what is his purpose in doing so?

27
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,550
Go in the opposite direction.

28
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,030
What does that mean?

29
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,240
Duanmu Qingcang deliberately asked us to pass on false information

30
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,720
and concentrate all the troops of the three cities

31
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,270
on Tianlu City.

32
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,600
Then the defense of the three cities is empty.

33
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,520
Duanmu Qingcang can take advantage of the situation,

34
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,520
attack and occupy three cities in one fell swoop.

35
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:43,270
Then all three cities will be the dominion of the South Desolation.

36
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,800
The isolated Tianlu City will be cut off sooner or later.

37
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,360
Duanmu Qingcang can easily

38
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,910
take Tianlu City.

39
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,880
Fortunately, My Lord and Her Highness find out in time,

40
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,520
or we'll be

41
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,800
the sinners of Tianchu forever.

42
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,270
But now Duanmu Qingcang is so ambitious

43
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,520
that he is less likely to accept peace talks.

44
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:00,600
Those who are good at fighting

45
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,550
seek the situation

46
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:03,910
and do not excessively demand others.

47
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,240
There is only one way to get him to withdraw,

48
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:07,910
the situation.

49
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,270
Get a clear understanding of the situation.

50
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,520
Very good, my son.

51
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,829
My father-in-law has promised that

52
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,240
he will never hurt the soldiers of South Desolation

53
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,079
and will release them all home

54
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,750
to show the sincerity of seeking peace.

55
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:29,670
Your Majesty,

56
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,720
these letters were left by the late empress.

57
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,670
You will understand everything after reading them.

58
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:43,470
I have read these letters

59
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,910
word by word.

60
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,600
Now

61
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,800
I'm a wife

62
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,600
and going to be a mother.

63
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,550
So I deeply understand the idea of the late empress.

64
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,800
On the third day of March in lunar calendar,

65
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:02,470
the Shangsi Festival arrives.

66
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,320
Willows sprout in early spring,

67
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,750
but my husband has been away from home

68
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,320
for more than three months.

69
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,600
I don't want to go for a spring outing,

70
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:13,670
because I'm afraid to see others in pairs

71
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,030
while I am walking alone.

72
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,720
Grain Rain is the last solar term of spring,

73
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,550
with flowers falling.

74
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,600
I ask you when to come back, but you don't know,

75
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,760
making me sadder.

76
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,390
The weather was unusually variable.

77
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,040
When the plum turns yellow,

78
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,200
the baby in the belly

79
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,550
grows up day by day.

80
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,880
I really feel upset that the child

81
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,670
has not heard its father's voice yet.

82
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:43,920
It's raining and snowing,

83
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,480
chilled to the bone.

84
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:48,720
Hope you can realize your great ambition.

85
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:50,720
If my child

86
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,670
is a boy,

87
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:54,480
I just want you to be at ease

88
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,790
and stay away from the war.

89
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,159
If you are a girl,

90
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:01,440
I hope you don't marry into the imperial family.

91
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,270
For my child

92
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,110
and all children of the world,

93
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,320
please

94
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:09,950
bless the world peace

95
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,070
and stop the war,

96
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,880
so that every family can be reunited,

97
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,270
no longer suffering from separation.

98
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,670
Your Majesty, please retreat.

99
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,480
Let the husbands in South Desolation and Tianchu

100
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,070
never separate from their wives again.

101
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,110
Let the mothers in South Desolation and Tianchu

102
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,000
no longer have to worry about their children.

103
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,110
Transmit my order,

104
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,350
retreat!

105
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,670
As far as I know,

106
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,320
your birthday party

107
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,200
is ostensibly organized by the Empress Dowager.

108
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,720
Actually, your father did it.

109
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,720
If we don't wear the clothes he prepares,

110
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,000
would it be okay?

111
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,550
I accept the fact that he is my father,

112
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:32,270
but it doesn't mean

113
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,550
I accept the identity of South Desolation Prince.

114
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:38,670
But in fact,

115
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:40,159
he didn't kill Lieutenant General Zou.

116
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,040
He's much better than before.

117
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,070
Rong,

118
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,230
I just want to spend the rest of my life with you,

119
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,110
without being disturbed by anyone.

120
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:51,950
Don't worry, Rong.

121
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:53,040
I'll take care of it.

122
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,200
Cheng,

123
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:07,160
does the four-dragon robes I gave you

124
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,160
not fit?

125
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,480
Not used to it.

126
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,830
OK, OK.

127
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:19,160
Didn't we agree to talk about family affairs

128
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,640
instead of state affairs?

129
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,070
Everything is subject to the arrangement of mother.

130
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,760
Your Majesty, thank you for your understanding,

131
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,950
agreeing to retreat, and accepting the peace talks

132
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,390
for the consideration of the people of the two countries.

133
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,040
Rong is here

134
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:33,000
to thank you with tea, your Majesty.

135
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:40,230
For the sake of my grandson,

136
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,270
also,

137
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,760
to eliminate external aggression, we must stabilize domestic situation.

138
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:44,640
After stabilizing the situation,

139
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,510
it is also a proper way

140
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,640
to discuss major plans.

141
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,790
Your Majesty, do you want to bet with me again?

142
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:51,920
OK.

143
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:55,159
Come on.

144
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,110
Cheng's unruly strength

145
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,160
is like the way

146
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,830
your father squabbles with your grandfather.

147
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:11,790
Your Majesty.

148
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:12,510
Empress Dowager.

149
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:14,350
Bai, you are back.

150
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,600
We have been waiting for you.

151
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,160
Sit down quickly.

152
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,720
The army returned home.

153
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:19,920
As commander in chief,

154
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,270
you haven't rectified the morale of the army.

155
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,040
Why do you come back first?

156
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,440
It's my fault.

157
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,790
I'll go back to camp.

158
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,110
Stop,

159
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,600
rectify the morale of the army?

160
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:33,710
I think you are trying to upset your mother.

161
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,030
Bai,

162
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,909
today is your birthday.

163
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:38,710
This longevity noodles will be cold

164
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,909
if you don't eat it.

165
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,400
In this case,

166
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,789
sit down.

167
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,550
Thank you, father.

168
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,320
Sit down.

169
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,550
Wait a minute.

170
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:54,710
I have an idea.

171
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,030
Although

172
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,350
you two brothers were born on the same day,

173
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:02,640
we don't know who is elder.

174
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,520
Why don't we take this chance

175
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,590
to see who is elder?

176
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,150
Whoever eats more noodles

177
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,640
will be the elder brother.

178
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,760
What about?

179
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:12,550
OK.

180
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:16,440
Anyway, I'm more mature.

181
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,910
Then I will be

182
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,350
the elder brother.

183
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:20,110
Wait a minute.

184
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,320
In ancient times, Kong Rong gives up the biggest pear.

185
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,910
As a younger brother,

186
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:27,200
you should know the public order, moral,

187
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,840
and rites.

188
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,230
My little brother.

189
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,080
Come on, my little brother.

190
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,350
You're the little brother.

191
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,080
Rong is pregnant.

192
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,350
Why don't you accompany her?

193
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,670
Grandmother is talking with Rong.

194
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,280
As a husband,

195
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,030
I was kicked out.

196
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:58,710
Well,

197
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,400
everything is inconstant.

198
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,640
I didn't expect us

199
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:05,110
to have a day of drinking and having fun.

200
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:06,470
I believe

201
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,640
there are many such opportunities in the future.

202
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:09,710
Yeah.

203
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:13,000
By the way, Duanmu,

204
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,110
don't you want to ask me

205
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,670
about my foster father?

206
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,080
Not interested.

207
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,760
In fact, he has always been caring about you.

208
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:26,550
I didn't know

209
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,590
why he came to South Desolation

210
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,790
every year.

211
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:31,590
Now I understand.

212
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:33,880
He came here to see you.

213
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:35,910
I don't want to hear any news

214
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,470
about this man.

215
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,520
I have only one father.

216
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,960
You two didn't invite your father

217
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,400
when you drink.

218
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,230
Father.

219
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:51,320
Cheng,

220
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,910
after the peace talks,

221
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,230
what's your plan?

222
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,230
I plan to go back to the island with Rong

223
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,000
to live a happy

224
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,590
and uncontested life.

225
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,280
What about my grandson?

226
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:03,670
I'll bring him back

227
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,350
to see you and my grandmother.

228
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:08,760
OK.

229
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:17,910
Cheng,

230
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,910
I know your temper is like me.

231
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,550
What you decide

232
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,230
will never be changed,

233
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,760
but remember that

234
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:29,880
here

235
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,960
will always be your home.

236
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,000
Thank you, father.

237
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,440
The documents for peace talks have been prepared.

238
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,550
You hurry back and get ready

239
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:09,760
to return to Tianchu.

240
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:10,710
OK.

241
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,350
Maybe one day he will change his mind

242
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,350
and come back to you, father.

243
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:35,080
Let him go.

244
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,910
At least,

245
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,670
I still have you

246
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,640
by my side.

247
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,960
Father, you're really in good spirits.

248
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:18,880
Your Majesty.

249
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:19,590
Say.

250
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,880
The prince and his wife have already set off for Tianchu.

251
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,470
One more thing...

252
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,030
Just let me know if there is anything.

253
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,640
Yi Feichi tried to escape,

254
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:36,710
but he has been caught back by the shadow guard in time.

255
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:37,790
I will handle it

256
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,350
myself.

257
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,030
Just leave.

258
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:42,910
Yes.

259
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,640
I know what you're going to say.

260
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:53,470
About making Shenwei Cannon,

261
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,550
I will stop Yi Feichi.

262
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:59,110
But he knows too much.

263
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,670
He has to stay in the South Desolation.

264
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:04,230
Yes,

265
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:05,960
father is wise.

266
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,550
Mu Qing,

267
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:17,670
you know what?

268
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:19,840
Although Cheng

269
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,910
hasn't returned to me now,

270
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,960
he already accepted me

271
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,760
in his heart.

272
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,110
Thank you.

273
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:33,670
It's all

274
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:36,880
your credit.

275
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,960
But you

276
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:48,350
never blame me.

277
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,710
I was thinking that

278
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,910
if I could put down

279
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:57,080
my obsession earlier,

280
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,590
maybe you would

281
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,910
be still by my side now.

282
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:19,960
I miss you every night,

283
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,440
but I never see you.

284
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:10,760
General Hua Jr. is back.

285
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:14,760
Dad!

286
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,200
Rong, Cheng,

287
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,550
you're back at last.

288
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:21,080
This time, the retreat of the South Desolation

289
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,520
is all your credit.

290
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,320
Dad,

291
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,790
it's more than retreating.

292
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,710
Three days later, in Shili Slope,

293
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,110
my father will come to

294
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:30,230
meet you

295
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:32,110
and formally sign the truce agreement.

296
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:33,880
So good.

297
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,000
It's so good.

298
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,200
From now on,

299
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,670
I, my old bones,

300
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,280
can have a good rest.

301
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,200
Yes.

302
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:46,320
Rong,

303
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,590
your belly...

304
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,840
Of course, I'm pregnant

305
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,840
with the grandson or granddaughter

306
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,080
of our wise and heroic General Hua.

307
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,590
Wow, very good.

308
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,110
Let it have a look at

309
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:02,710
the fruits of his grandfather's effort last night.

310
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:05,829
All the toys in this room

311
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:07,950
are made by myself.

312
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:08,800
Look at

313
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,589
this little animal,

314
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,680
small bamboo basket,

315
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,470
small top

316
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,560
and this wooden horse.

317
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:15,400
This wooden horse was your favorite when you were a child.

318
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:16,880
Give birth to it quickly,

319
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,710
and let it have a good time.

320
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:18,520
No, no,

321
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,190
dad, stop!

322
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,710
I'm less than two months pregnant.

323
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:24,040
It's too early to plan for him, aren't you?

324
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:28,880
By the way,

325
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:31,520
have you named your child yet?

326
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,590
The nickname is Daodao.

327
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,190
I hope you give the child a name.

328
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,400
Now we don't know whether it's a boy or a girl.

329
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:42,590
We can pick a name for both boy and girl.

330
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,110
Let me think about it,

331
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,110
think about it.

332
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,560
Write a few more.

333
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,110
Names for both boy and girl.

334
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,760
Your mother will be very happy

335
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,520
when she receives the good news

336
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,000
of your pregnancy.

337
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,920
Qin Shangcheng,

338
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,520
am I a little wayward?

339
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,680
Why do you say so?

340
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:30,950
Now,

341
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,160
I'm pregnant,

342
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,280
but I still let you come out with me

343
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:36,310
to release carrier pigeons

344
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,800
and watch stars in the night wind.

345
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:44,950
What you want to see is not the stars,

346
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,160
but your mother.

347
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:50,760
Nobody knows me better than you.

348
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,680
Just now I observed that your father

349
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,110
was also looking forward to the birth of Daodao.

350
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,590
Now he also has the heart to retire.

351
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,230
After the peace talks,

352
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,590
let's take him back to Huarong Island

353
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,160
and let him be surrounded by grandchildren,

354
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,400
enjoying the happiness of family union.

355
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:04,350
Good!

356
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,430
In fact, I've long wanted our whole family

357
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,830
to live on Huarong Island.

358
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:08,760
Look,

359
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,640
like the Big Dipper in the sky,

360
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,880
we will always be together

361
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:13,000
and never separate.

362
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,470
Rong,

363
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,590
who do the seven stars represent?

364
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,070
Of course, it's your father, my father,

365
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:28,230
grandmother, you and me, and Daodao.

366
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,070
That's only

367
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,040
six.

368
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,190
Is it true that you will have a baby brain

369
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,880
after pregnancy?

370
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:36,430
I,

371
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:38,800
I won't speak to you.

372
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,350
No, no, no.

373
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:42,760
What you said is extremely true.

374
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,070
There must be twins in your belly.

375
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,430
There are two children.

376
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,230
That's right.

377
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,520
Actually,

378
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,070
in my mind,

379
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,760
this extra star

380
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,830
is your mother.

381
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:02,070
In fact, she has been around you all the time,

382
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,950
so that we can turn bad luck into good luck.

383
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:25,760
Come here,

384
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,400
Cheng,

385
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,400
Rong.

386
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,830
Speaking of this,

387
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,560
if it was not the war,

388
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,350
I would never know Duanmu Qingcang.

389
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:38,680
Before, we were enemies on the battlefield,

390
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,470
while today, we are going to sit together

391
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:42,760
and sign a truce,

392
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:45,350
and we have become relatives by marriage.

393
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,800
Life is uncertain.

394
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,590
Rong,

395
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:51,760
don't worry.

396
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,880
Dad won't lose

397
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,280
in momentum.

398
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,190
Of course.

399
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:00,680
Zhang,

400
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,230
I tell you that

401
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:02,710
once the truce is signed,

402
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:04,160
I, the best counselor around the King Pirate,

403
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,430
will also make great achievements.

404
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:06,880
When the princess comes back,

405
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,680
she will be fascinated by my heroic success.

406
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:09,640
Qian,

407
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,560
I don't know what will happen to the princess.

408
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,230
But if you eat like this,

409
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,680
your teeth will surely be hurt.

410
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,040
What do you know?

411
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,230
Pain in my mouth

412
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,110
but sweetness in my heart.

413
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,800
Excuse me!

414
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:23,560
General,

415
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,590
this is the meeting gift sent by South Desolation.

416
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,560
After all, I still fall behind.

417
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,560
Qin's father

418
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,920
is considerate.

419
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:37,040
Open it.

420
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,070
Isn't this General Zou?

421
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:44,920
General!

422
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,110
General,

423
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:48,110
today Duanmu Qingcang led an army

424
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:49,560
to raid Xunyang, Shaoguan and Rongcheng.

425
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,430
These three cities have been occupied.

426
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,350
Prepare a horse.

427
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:51,800
Yes.

428
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:53,040
Father-in-law,

429
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,350
I'll go with you.

430
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,350
Cheng,

431
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:59,190
now the negotiations have broken down

432
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,920
and three cities have been occupied.

433
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,680
Soldiers in the army

434
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:04,350
will be angry with you.

435
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,110
You take Rong back to Tianlu City first,

436
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,430
and wait for my message.

437
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:20,800
Dad has been gone for two days.

438
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,280
News comes from the front line.

439
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:24,520
It's said that after occupying the three cities,

440
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,230
the South Desolation blocked the Tianlu City,

441
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:28,070
and an important channel to the capital.

442
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,000
Fortunately, Dad kept the city in time.

443
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,070
Before the South Desolation formed an encirclement,

444
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:33,190
they successfully guarded a pass.

445
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:34,830
However,

446
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,920
judging from the strength of South Desolation,

447
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,880
my father may not be able to hold

448
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:40,430
until the reinforcements from the capital arrive.

449
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:41,880
But I still don't understand.

450
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,640
They have promised peace talks.

451
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,710
Why did My Lord's father

452
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,710
go back on his word?

453
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,800
Isn't this

454
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,350
putting My Lord in injustice?

455
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,710
My Lord, your Highness,

456
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,800
sorry to say that

457
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:54,830
maybe

458
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,710
your father is using the relationship

459
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:58,950
to get your trust

460
00:22:58,950 --> 00:22:59,680
and pretend to accept peace talks.

461
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,230
In fact, his has never

462
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:02,560
given up the ambition of occupying Tianchu.

463
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,190
Poor General Zou,

464
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,560
he has been devoting all his life to Tianchu,

465
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,640
but he didn't escape the disaster in the end.

466
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,590
But Qin Shangcheng,

467
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:16,950
this incident is too sudden,

468
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:18,920
so I suspect

469
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,040
there is something we don't know.

470
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,800
Anyway,

471
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,430
it starts because of me.

472
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:28,830
I must give Tianchu an explanation.

473
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:31,230
Tomorrow I will set out

474
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,070
to ask him in person.

475
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,560
If he is really like what Dayou said,

476
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,560
even if he is my biological father,

477
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,040
I will never forgive him.

478
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:42,880
Qian Dayou,

479
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:44,830
pick several good horses for me

480
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,190
and we'll leave tomorrow.

481
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:55,560
Dayou?

482
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,110
Ling,

483
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,160
why are you here?

484
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:02,040
Being hit by you,

485
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,310
I almost forgot my business.

486
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,070
We'll talk about it later.

487
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:12,520
Rong, Qin,

488
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,710
my father was very angry when he learned about the news.

489
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:15,880
He issued the imperial edict overnight

490
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,190
to execute Qin.

491
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,680
I think the imperial edict will arrive at Tianlu City soon.

492
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,400
Qin,

493
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,560
take my token and leave the city.

494
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,560
I, Qin Shangcheng, have a clear conscience.

495
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,680
Why should I run away?

496
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:30,230
But in order to avoid unnecessary trouble,

497
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,160
it seems that we should set out early.

498
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,680
So without further ado,

499
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,000
we should pack up

500
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,680
and set out at once.

501
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,430
My teeth are too disappointing.

502
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,000
Drop the ball at the last minute!

503
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,950
I can't speak clearly now.

504
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,350
My only trump card is useless.

505
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:01,830
Forget it,

506
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:03,110
I can't speak,

507
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,070
which will compromise my impression in the princess' mind.

508
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,560
Come back tomorrow.

509
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:14,230
Qian,

510
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:15,920
why are you at the door of my room.

511
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:19,560
Haven't seen me for a long time,

512
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,350
do you miss me?

513
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:30,400
I got it!

514
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,190
Do you take one

515
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:33,000
every time you miss me?

516
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,470
Qian,

517
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:37,230
you've changed.

518
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,400
You've become quiet,

519
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,640
like a different person.

520
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,640
But now you're quite mature and steady.

521
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,520
Delicious,

522
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:52,640
I like it.

523
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,000
My Lord,

524
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,640
the carriage is ready

525
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,230
outside.

526
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,920
It seems that it is still a little late.

527
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,470
Here is the imperial edict

528
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:06,560
for Qin Shangcheng.

529
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,880
From the God's blessings,

530
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:19,430
behold the message of the emperor that

531
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,310
King Pirate, Qin Shangcheng,

532
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:23,190
concealed the identity of South Desolation Prince

533
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:25,560
and secretly communicated with the enemy,

534
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,160
making Tianchu lose three cities.

535
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,350
His behavior has shaken the morale of the army

536
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:30,590
and disturbed people's hearts.

537
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:32,190
In order to settle the grievances of Tianchu,

538
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,280
Qin Shangcheng must be immediately imprisoned in a dungeon

539
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,920
and executed on another day.

540
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,040
That's all.

541
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,400
I'm the Sixth Princess.

542
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,640
No one is allowed to touch Qin.

543
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:41,760
Princess,

544
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:44,110
don't embarrass me, please.

545
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,880
Don't you know

546
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,310
how angry the Emperor is about this,

547
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,430
princess?

548
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,920
Rong, don't answer it.

549
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,430
General Hua Jr., you're considerate.

550
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:02,710
Honey,

551
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:04,710
you used to protect me.

552
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,040
Today, I protect you.

553
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:08,710
You...

554
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,800
Stop, Rong!

555
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,710
Sixth Princess,

556
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,040
Lord Yu.

557
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,040
General Hua.

558
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,160
Rong,

559
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,640
thanks to the grace of the Emperor,

560
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,920
our family is loyal for generations.

561
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:34,680
Now Qin Shangcheng colludes with the enemy,

562
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,040
and the evidence is conclusive.

563
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:39,280
I'm really powerless.

564
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:40,070
Dad,

565
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:42,040
why don't you believe us?

566
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,110
Obviously, there are many twists and turns.

567
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:45,590
This is a capital crime.

568
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:48,800
Qin Shangcheng,

569
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:51,800
are you guilty?

570
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,280
I obey your arrangement.

571
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,110
Qin Shangcheng?

572
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:04,400
Rong,

573
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,760
your father

574
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:08,040
has his own plan.

575
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,110
Don't worry.

576
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,430
I'll be fine.

577
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,680
Your Majesty,

578
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,110
the pass guarded by Hua Mantian

579
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,350
has been taken by our army.

580
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,520
He led the remnant army to flee back to Tianlu City.

581
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,310
Shall we strike while the iron is hot

582
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,880
and occupy Tianlu city at one fell swoop?

583
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:58,950
It's better to wait with ease than to attack the city rashly.

584
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:01,280
When their psychological defense collapses,

585
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,800
we will attack Tianlu City.

586
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,000
Yes!

587
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:07,800
Father,

588
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:08,710
father,

589
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,430
why did you go back on your word?

590
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:12,110
Made Qin the target of public criticism.

591
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:14,640
I did it on purpose.

592
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,950
So the exposure of his identity as South Desolation Prince

593
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:19,640
is also done by you?

594
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:24,000
I have to drive Cheng to a dead end,

595
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:25,230
and then it's possible for him

596
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,110
to come back to me.

597
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:32,400
So in your heart,

598
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:35,350
unifying the world is more important than anything else.

599
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:37,110
We are all just

600
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,830
pieces on your chessboard.

601
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:39,520
Bai,

602
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,950
I asked you to come here

603
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:44,560
to save him,

604
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,310
not to teach me how to do it.

605
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,000
Qin Shangcheng is my brother,

606
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:51,110
I will go anyway.

607
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:10,000
Did it hurt?

608
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:14,350
If you run again next time,

609
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,280
the price is not just this leg.

610
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:18,160
I give you ten days

611
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,560
to give me the drawings of Shenwei Cannon,

612
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,590
otherwise...

613
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,350
Break into the jail?

614
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:33,710
Now that you have made up your mind,

615
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:35,230
I will sacrifice my life to accompany you.

616
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,040
Count me in.

617
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:38,830
This is a compulsory course to become a swordswoman.

618
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:40,350
I want to follow footsteps of Rong.

619
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,310
Your Highness, don't worry.

620
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,070
Qian and I must...

621
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:43,190
My Lord is not here.

622
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:45,070
As the most daring man in the pirate regiment,

623
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:46,230
I, swordsman Qian,

624
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:48,040
will act from a strong sense of duty.

625
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:49,520
Swordsman Qian?

626
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,950
Don't be kidding, okay?

627
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,430
All right,

628
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,800
at midnight tonight,

629
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:55,950
let's act on time.

630
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,280
Qian,

631
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,000
the princess just made fun of you.

632
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,710
Aren't you angry?

633
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:01,280
No.

634
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,760
Then your teeth are healed.

635
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:04,160
Why don't you tell her that you love her?

636
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:07,800
Zhang,

637
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:10,430
it's the Emperor of Tianchu who wants to kill My Lord now.

638
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:11,560
He is the father of princess.

639
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:12,830
My Lord is in critical condition now.

640
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:14,280
What is the most important thing to do?

641
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,680
To save My Lord.

642
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,800
Only when My Lord is safe

643
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,430
can I confess to the princess.

644
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:19,560
Understand?

645
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,800
I'm responsible for My Lord,

646
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,950
as well as for the Princess.

647
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
It makes sense, Qian.

648
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:34,830
He really looks like swordsman Qian.

649
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,350
Let's go.

650
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:54,470
Your Highness,

651
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:55,680
something is wrong.

652
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,070
Did someone save My Lord first?

653
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,000
It's hard to tell whether they are enemies or not.

654
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:00,310
Let's play it by ear.

655
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:19,190
Dad?

656
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:24,040
Dad!

657
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,470
Dad!

658
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,160
Dad!

659
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,190
Dad, what happened?

660
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:31,950
Dad?

661
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,350
Dad!

662
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,470
Dad, what happened?

663
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,040
Dad, say a word please.

664
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,640
I am Rong.

665
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,310
Wake up,

666
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:49,190
dad.

667
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:50,520
What happened?

668
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,160
Get up quickly.

669
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,430
Dad, tell me what to do?

670
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:56,000
Tell me, please.

671
00:32:58,190 --> 00:32:59,230
Dad!

672
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:01,520
Dad, what happened?

673
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,590
Dad!

674
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:04,760
Dad!

675
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,680
Dad!

676
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:18,920
Dad, get up.

677
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:25,350
He didn't stop breathing.

678
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:26,280
He just fainted.

679
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,830
We can try to wake up a guy

680
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,400
to see if we can figure out the situation.

681
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,110
Don't bother.

682
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,310
Where's General Hua Jr.?

683
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:37,880
There she is.

684
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:41,760
We need to talk alone.

685
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,230
Lieutenant General Yan,

686
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,110
what's going on?

687
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,470
Who is the murderer of General Hua?

688
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,400
It was Qin Shangcheng who killed General Hua.

689
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:50,710
You're talking nonsense!

690
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,280
General Hua is My Lord's father-in-law.

691
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,190
It's absolutely true!

692
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,160
An escaped jailer saw it clearly.

693
00:33:58,470 --> 00:33:59,710
No one believes you.

694
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:00,110
Yes,

695
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,520
we're never gonna believe that

696
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,400
My Lord would do this.

697
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,070
Where is Qin Shangcheng now?

698
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:05,590
He was rescued by Duanmu Bai.

699
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,800
I took people to chase him,

700
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:07,560
but unfortunately

701
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,560
they escaped from Tianlu City.

702
00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:10,280
Then

703
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,520
what should we do now?

704
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,190
Let's chase outside the city.

705
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:15,000
Find Qin Shangcheng,

706
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,800
and we'll know what happened.

707
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:32,800
After running all night,

708
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:37,760
we have escaped from the pursuit range of Tianchu.

709
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:39,630
Yeah.

710
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:41,710
Can you tell me

711
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,840
what is going on?

712
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:48,710
OK.

713
00:34:49,949 --> 00:34:51,760
I believe you can keep my secret.

714
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:53,429
Actually...

715
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,360
Get out of the way.

716
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:04,600
Let's go.

717
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:30,280
You run first.

718
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,120
Leave me alone.

719
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,710
What are you talking about?

720
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,280
I, Qin Shangcheng, will never leave my brother

721
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,280
and live alone.

722
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:37,470
Besides,

723
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,950
we haven't

724
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,630
had enough wine yet.

725
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:44,080
I didn't expect that you like drinking so much.

726
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:49,150
Even if I can't get out of this bamboo forest today,

727
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,360
I won't let anyone walking out of here alive.

728
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,360
It seems that someone has got here first.

729
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,120
Take Qin Shangcheng away.

730
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,280
How about Prince Jing?

731
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:33,190
Leave him alone.

732
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,760
This is what His Majesty means.

733
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,120
Let's go.

734
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:00,320
Duanmu Bai!

735
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,710
Duanmu Bai!

736
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:02,670
Are you all right?

737
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:04,320
Don't die.

738
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:06,080
Duanmu Bai, wake up.

739
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,560
Don't worry.

740
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:15,320
I won't die

741
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,470
for a while.

742
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,870
You scared me.

743
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:20,360
Duanmu Bai!

744
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,280
Duanmu Bai!

745
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:24,190
He fainted.

746
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,000
He's fine.

747
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,470
I have to take him back to treatment as soon as possible.

748
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,670
He has a special status.

749
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:30,600
Returning to Tianlu City will cause unnecessary trouble.

750
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:32,320
I'll take him back to my camp.

751
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,470
You tell everything here to Crab.

752
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:35,470
OK.

753
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:43,470
What are you talking about?

754
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:45,150
Your Majesty,

755
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:47,000
the prince was stabbed

756
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,120
and lost too much blood,

757
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,670
The wound has been infected.

758
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:51,080
There's really nothing I can do.

759
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,520
Nothing you can do?

760
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:54,280
What's the use of keeping you alive?

761
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:55,870
Take him out and kill him.

762
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:56,710
Yes.

763
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:58,080
Your Majesty, mercy.

764
00:37:58,390 --> 00:37:59,390
Your Majesty, spare my life!

765
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:01,430
Majesty, forgive me please!

766
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:02,760
Majesty!

767
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,630
Do you think I'm cruel?

768
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,390
You have your reason for doing so.

769
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,360
I only obey your orders.

770
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:14,470
That's good.

771
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:17,600
You hurry to take the prince to the capital for treatment.

772
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,000
Remember

773
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,320
to save him.

774
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:21,360
Your Majesty, don't worry.

775
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:23,120
I will live up to your trust.

776
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:23,870
I'll arrange it now.

777
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:24,390
Wait a minute.

778
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:27,040
Get those four lieutenants here.

779
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:27,710
Yes.

780
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:39,150
Your Majesty.

781
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:41,320
Pass on my order

782
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,630
to gather an army to besiege the city.

783
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:43,910
Cut off all links between Tianlu city

784
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:45,670
and Tianchu Jingcheng.

785
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,040
Even a mosquito

786
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,600
is not allowed to fly into Tianlu City.

787
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:49,840
The attack will begin

788
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:52,360
in seven days.

789
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:52,950
Yes.

790
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:15,800
It's over.

791
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,560
Finally, the people no longer have to suffer from war.

792
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:22,190
There is nothing

793
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,360
in this world

794
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,040
that Hua Rong and Qin Shangcheng can't do.

795
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:48,390
At the request of Qin,

796
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,470
I went back to capital to stop my father from sending troops.

797
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:56,150
I didn't know

798
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:58,710
how to go then,

799
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,320
and left you some specious words.

800
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,710
Can you understand?

801
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,150
Will we meet again?

802
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:15,080
Since you miss me so much,

803
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,150
why don't I come?

804
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:24,320
I heard everything you just said.

805
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,600
Are you talking to me?

806
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,360
You are a girl

807
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,630
and you shouldn't enter my room.

808
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:29,710
Behave yourself.

809
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:31,950
Crab told me that

810
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,760
you said we will grow old together

811
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,080
after we meet again.

812
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:37,000
So you're not others,

813
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,280
you're my man.

814
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,910
You won't go back on what you said, will you?

815
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,360
Tomorrow I will lead my troops back to report.

816
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:47,870
When I come back,

817
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,430
I'll give you an answer.

818
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,080
I just accept a satisfactory answer.

819
00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:00,600
If you don't refuse, you agree.

820
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:04,360
Now it's settled.

821
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,710
Then I'll

822
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:07,320
stay with you tonight

823
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,360
and go back to the island tomorrow.

824
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:10,760
You sleep with me?

825
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,080
Is it cold?
