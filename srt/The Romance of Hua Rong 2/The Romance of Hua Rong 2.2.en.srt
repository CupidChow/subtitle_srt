[The Romance of Hua Rong 2]
[EP02]

3
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,680
Two tasks for us.

4
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:39,550
First.

5
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:41,310
Escort the merchant ship back to Mingzhou City.

6
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:42,039
Second.

7
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:43,229
Participate in the survey

8
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:44,680
about the South Desolation Spies.

9
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,630
I have our future

10
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:48,000
planned well.

11
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,720
We will

12
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,830
give birth to

13
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:50,759
two babies in 3 years.

14
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,590
I'll wait for you at the pier

15
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:53,950
at five pm tomorrow.

16
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,360
She's harassed him.

17
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,000
Tell me the truth, Zhang Xian.

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Where were her hands on?

19
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:58,360
Rong

20
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,509
Rong

21
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:01,040
Just give me some more time.

22
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,270
Mr. Wan,

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,110
haven't seen you for a long time.

24
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,829
Here is

25
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:32,880
everything you have ordered.

26
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,960
Do you mind if I have a check?

27
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,520
The tattoo of the South Desolation Spy.

28
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:29,160
Good.

29
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,720
The finest rice of Tianchu.

30
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,670
Sure enough, you've kept your word.

31
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:35,670
Mr. Wan

32
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:37,000
What will I get

33
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,079
for keeping my word?

34
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,190
What do you want?

35
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,600
How about going to Wanfu Building

36
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,240
together and having

37
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,360
a chat after this deal?

38
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:51,470
My Lord

39
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:52,910
My Lord

40
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:54,630
The china shop

41
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,470
was taken by us.

42
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,240
Here is a name list.

43
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,160
You're not Mr. Wan.

44
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,630
Who are you?

45
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,080
Qin Shangcheng

46
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,600
How dare you!

47
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,390
How dare you fool me?

48
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,880
Since it is so,

49
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,270
nobody leave alive.

50
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,360
Guards!

51
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,390
You've planned

52
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,000
all this from the start.

53
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,110
Come on!

54
00:04:58,830 --> 00:04:59,600
Spare none to search for Ye.

55
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,160
Don't let her get away.

56
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,270
- Got it!
- OK.

57
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,110
Don't move.

58
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,160
You've been following me for so long.

59
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,160
Aren't you tired?

60
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,070
You scared me.

61
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,270
You're such a whiny little girl.

62
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,070
Why are you following me all the time?

63
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,640
Although I hardly leave home,

64
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,950
I admire the swordman with excellent

65
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,760
martial arts since I was a child.

66
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,159
I saw your agility last night.

67
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:53,550
Your charm attracted me, so...

68
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:55,830
I didn't expect

69
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,440
you could be my confidant.

70
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,110
So can you show

71
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,230
something new to your confidant?

72
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,550
What a bad luck!

73
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:07,510
I have gang business to deal with today.

74
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,070
But if you really

75
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,350
want to talk with me,

76
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,110
let's meet

77
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,390
at five pm

78
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,790
in Tianxiang Restaurant.

79
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,950
May I ask your name?

80
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:25,480
The name is Feng, just call me Feng Er.

81
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,110
Yours?

82
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,040
You can call me Rong.

83
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,790
Rong

84
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,640
Pass my order,

85
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,720
all men go search for Ye

86
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,880
and catch her as soon as possible.

87
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,159
Don't worry, My Lord.

88
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:48,640
I've told Zhang Xian to go to the black market.

89
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,200
He...

90
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,830
I'll hurry him up.

91
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:04,830
Rong

92
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:07,720
Rong

93
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,830
Qin Shangcheng

94
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,510
Why are you back so early?

95
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,070
I'm sorry, Rong.

96
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,920
I've been really busy and

97
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,480
neglected you these days.

98
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,790
Just wait a few days.

99
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:24,070
You don't have to explain to me.

100
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,440
I'm not blaming you.

101
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:27,390
Here you are.

102
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,550
Qin Shangcheng

103
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:33,640
Today

104
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,790
I read a script.

105
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,760
It's about Young's Female Warrior.

106
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,720
The Yang's female warriors

107
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,480
fought side by side with their husbands

108
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,550
to serve the country.

109
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:43,000
They're

110
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,200
really fabulous

111
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,200
couples, aren't they?

112
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,110
You are not secondary to

113
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,510
any men, either.

114
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,830
That's not what I meant.

115
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:53,720
I mean

116
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,950
I'm not only Rong

117
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,159
but also Swordwoman Huahua.

118
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,880
So I can help you at any time

119
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,510
if you need me.

120
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,160
Rong, actually

121
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,070
you've helped me a lot

122
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,550
because you always help the weak.

123
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:04,880
It doesn't count.

124
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,110
In fact, I want to tell you...

125
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,110
Rong, it suddenly occurred to me

126
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:08,040
that I forgot to tell

127
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,200
Qian Dayou something important.

128
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,790
I'll be right back.

129
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,670
Qin Shangcheng, just hear me out.

130
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:17,270
Why did he leave so soon?

131
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,110
Rong

132
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,110
You must be careful.

133
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,920
It was the same to my father.

134
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,550
He didn't come home before took concubines.

135
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,550
I believe he's busy with serious business.

136
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,270
But,

137
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,760
I thought everything would be

138
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,080
all right after leaving the island.

139
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,880
Things go like the old days, Wheeeee

140
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,880
I'm afraid, if it goes on like this,

141
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,350
our hearts are getting

142
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:42,470
farther apart.

143
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,440
Sure you will.

144
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,030
My mother told me

145
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,280
that men's affection

146
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,520
fades away much faster than women.

147
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:53,640
What about ...

148
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,640
I show you a way out.

149
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:55,790
Go ahead.

150
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,910
If he's indifferent to you,

151
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:58,790
you can treat him in the same way.

152
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,520
At the worst, you break up with him

153
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,400
No one loses nothing

154
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,320
My Lord

155
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,280
They're...

156
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,590
What are you doing here?

157
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:14,400
Zhang Xian found something new in the china shop.

158
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,200
I don't care about anything else.

159
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:17,640
You have to find a way

160
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,470
to take Zhu

161
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,000
away from Rong.

162
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,470
Or you'll never get your salary in your life.

163
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,590
My Lord

164
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,080
Stop!

165
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,640
Don't move.

166
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:35,590
Dayou

167
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:36,150
I don't move.

168
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:37,880
What?

169
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:38,910
Is that how

170
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,150
you respond an evil

171
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,110
man like me?

172
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,670
So what should I do?

173
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:45,230
Damn, Zhang Xian.

174
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:47,200
It doesn't work.

175
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,440
I come to tell you

176
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,110
to leave immediately with the money.

177
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:53,280
Stop pestering me.

178
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:54,320
No.

179
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,910
You helped me pay back the money last time.

180
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,470
I should repay you.

181
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,030
If I accepted your money,

182
00:09:59,320 --> 00:09:59,640
I could only...

183
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,640
Stop, stop.

184
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,670
Listen!

185
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,960
My girl has to know antiques,

186
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,000
do accounts and make money.

187
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You're...

188
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,350
Great.

189
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,550
My father is a grave robber.

190
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,080
He taught me how to authenticate antiques,

191
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,000
do accounts and do odd jobs.

192
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,080
Dayou, we're well suited

193
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,760
to each other, right?

194
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:18,110
When will you marry me?

195
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:18,760
Wait a minute.

196
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,150
Stay away from me!

197
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:20,710
10 feet.

198
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:22,440
Stop talking rubbish!

199
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,030
Leave here with the money.

200
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,320
Or I'll let you see the use of violence.

201
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,520
Violate whom, Qian Dayou?

202
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,000
Rong

203
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,670
Rong

204
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,200
Qian Dayou

205
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,710
Zhu is my younger sister.

206
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,440
She'll be with me from now on.

207
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,590
Go tell Qin Shangcheng.

208
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:40,550
Come to me if he wants to send her away.

209
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:55,640
It's good.

210
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,320
It looks the most similar to Rong.

211
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:58,880
My Lord

212
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,470
We've bought so many.

213
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:02,280
Shall we go back?

214
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,400
You don't get it.

215
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,640
I haven't been with Rong

216
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,200
for a long time because of the spy.

217
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:08,710
I'll make up for her this time.

218
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:09,670
It sounds reasonable.

219
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:11,230
My Lord

220
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:12,150
My Lord

221
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,550
Zhang

222
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,880
Zhang

223
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,470
The captured and the list

224
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:17,590
were sent to Mr. Wei?

225
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,640
Yes. He's jubilant.

226
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,440
Good.

227
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,640
It's not knowing whether Ye is dead or alive.

228
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,230
I can take time to tour Mingzhou City with Rong.

229
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,590
Exactly, My Lord.

230
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:27,320
Qian Dayou

231
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:30,470
Go and buy some seasonal candy and snacks.

232
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,880
Oh my Lord, Wheeeee

233
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:34,880
Get going.

234
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:39,840
Rong

235
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:42,030
Rong

236
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:43,590
Rong

237
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:45,400
Rong

238
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:47,710
I know

239
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,790
my previous behavior may

240
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,520
stop you from seeing my sincerity.

241
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,200
But you have to believe

242
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,200
I would never betray you.

243
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:55,760
I know it's hard for you

244
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,200
to cool down your anger.

245
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,110
I bought some snacks for you

246
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,440
from Zhiwei Zhai.

247
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,520
Have a try.

248
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,200
It smells good.

249
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:04,640
Try it.

250
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,110
If you continue being angry and ignoring me

251
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,760
I will

252
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:11,960
kiss you

253
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:14,400
until you forgive me.

254
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,520
What are you doing, Qin Shangcheng?

255
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,440
Rong

256
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,960
Qin, he...

257
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,910
He wants to kiss other girls?

258
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:26,550
Don't talk rot!

259
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,520
There's nobody here.

260
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,350
Stop it!

261
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,230
Qin Shangcheng

262
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,960
It's normal for you to have your own business.

263
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,440
I should have my own business, too.

264
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,400
I shouldn't bother you every day.

265
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:37,110
What?

266
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,030
You're not angry?

267
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:41,200
I'm not.

268
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:41,840
It's just a misunderstanding.

269
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,960
It's not necessary to get angry?

270
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,960
I'll go shopping with Zhu.

271
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,550
You can be busy with your work.

272
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:45,110
Bye.

273
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:53,710
Wait a minute.

274
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,280
No.

275
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:57,550
I'm screwed.

276
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,320
Zhu is

277
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,880
the bane of my marriage.

278
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,440
My Lord

279
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,230
I don't think her Highness

280
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:06,230
was angry just now.

281
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:06,670
Really?

282
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,840
You know nothing.

283
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,960
The calmer women look

284
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,080
the more serious

285
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,640
the consequences will be.

286
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,710
It seems that gifts are

287
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,880
not enough to please her this time.

288
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,230
A bigger surprise is needed.

289
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:24,960
Thanking for coming!

290
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,880
Welcome!

291
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,000
Are you sure she's here?

292
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,760
I got informer

293
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,760
Her Highness is in the private room

294
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:35,400
on the second floor.

295
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:37,910
Tell them to stand by.

296
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:38,910
Wait for my command.

297
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:39,520
As you wish.

298
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:41,150
Rong

299
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,880
I've prepared this gift with all my heart.

300
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,760
I'll give you a surprise first.

301
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,550
Once you accept it,

302
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:47,080
I'll light up the sky with fireworks for you.

303
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,280
By then...

304
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:49,760
Honey

305
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:52,550
You are really considerate.

306
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:54,550
It's so kind of you.

307
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,110
My Lord

308
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:00,710
My Lord

309
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,590
Indulged yourself in fantasies?

310
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,080
It's time to get in.

311
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,960
He won't break an appointment, will he?

312
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,710
Don't worry.

313
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,400
You're so pretty.

314
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,640
And you asked him out.

315
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,790
No men will

316
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:25,910
break your appointment.

317
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:27,080
My Lord

318
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:27,550
I should be relieved then.

319
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,320
She doesn't seem to be talking about you.

320
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,280
Shut up!

321
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,470
Wait

322
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,520
and see who it is.

323
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:33,590
You're right.

324
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:34,960
Let's go.

325
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,520
Yes Sir.

326
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,000
Come in and have a look!

327
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,110
My Lord

328
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,590
Does her Highness

329
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:55,520
cease to be faithful?

330
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,080
What are you talking about?

331
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,080
Don't talk rot!

332
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:58,670
Rong must be angry

333
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,000
because I've ignored her

334
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,590
and fool me deliberately.

335
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:03,350
Right.

336
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,640
But she doesn't know we're here.

337
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,320
There are other misunderstandings.

338
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,710
If you don't believe me

339
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:10,760
I can ask her when she comes out.

340
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,230
Yes.

341
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,230
Why didn't he come?

342
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,470
Your Highness.

343
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:15,350
Why are you here?

344
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,030
Your Highness

345
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,400
We're stuffed and we

346
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,200
come out to take a walk.

347
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:21,880
Why are you here, Rong?

348
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:22,710
I...

349
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,030
We're stuffed and we

350
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,030
have some fun here.

351
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:28,590
Just for fun

352
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:30,200
without waiting for someone?

353
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:30,640
No.

354
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,520
I'm waiting for nobody.

355
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,400
You three are all that I should wait for.

356
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,350
I'm not waiting for anybody.

357
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,350
I'm tired and I'll go to sleep.

358
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,350
Let's go.

359
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,320
Your Highness

360
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:42,640
My Lord

361
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,840
I'm sorry for your loss.

362
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,280
I didn't expect

363
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,320
you to ask me out so soon.

364
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,670
I'm not ready for it.

365
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,470
I'm not ready, either.

366
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:57,150
What?

367
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,320
No.

368
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,320
I mean

369
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,200
Did I prevent from accompanying

370
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,470
Rong?

371
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:02,520
No.

372
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,590
Rong

373
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:05,030
has her own business.

374
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:06,840
Do you know

375
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,350
what she is busy with recently?

376
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,440
Dayou

377
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,080
Are you fishing for information?

378
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,710
How is this possible?

379
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,000
Is that what you think of me?

380
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,550
I have no purpose.

381
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:18,590
You can answer me or not.

382
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:19,590
Alright.

383
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,520
I know one of

384
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
her secrets for sure if you want to know.

385
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,080
So tell me.

386
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,440
You want to know it?

387
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,440
Yes, of course.

388
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:31,550
Then you have to give me your personal belongings.

389
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,280
Personal?

390
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,110
Thank you.

391
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:52,470
Can you tell me now?

392
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,230
Then I'll whisper you.

393
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:55,910
Go on.

394
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,400
Although

395
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,150
Rong is angry,

396
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:02,790
she loves Qin

397
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,710
so much actually.

398
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:06,640
That's all?

399
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,069
That's it.

400
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,560
How can this be a secret?

401
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,470
This is a secret.

402
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:11,880
Give it back to me.

403
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:13,190
Give it back.

404
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:14,349
If you want it back

405
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:16,230
I'll pay you ten times the price.

406
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:16,800
I...

407
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,640
Come here and have a look!

408
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:21,950
Hurry up, Dayou.

409
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:22,589
Everybody.

410
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:24,589
These are all ancestral things

411
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:25,760
especially the porcelain vase.

412
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,829
It was from Yaozhou Kiln of previous dynasty.

413
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:28,920
The one and only.

414
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:30,800
Come here to have a look.

415
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,640
Dayou

416
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:32,680
If I can earn ten times the price

417
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,310
of the jade pendant,

418
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,190
I can keep the jade, right?

419
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,950
No, you cannot

420
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,310
These are

421
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:49,680
all you got from Zhu

422
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,350
for a whole day?

423
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:52,160
Yes.

424
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,560
Zhu has authenticated

425
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,230
all of them.

426
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:55,160
They're genuine.

427
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:58,040
That one looks great!

428
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:58,640
Take it easy.

429
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,680
It's very rare.

430
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:00,800
They're all real things?

431
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,110
Yes, for sure.

432
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,230
You stupid...

433
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,310
I was wrong, My Lord.

434
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,760
It's all Zhu's fault and I'm abetted.

435
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,880
I'll never do it again.

436
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,350
My Lord

437
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:08,920
My Lord

438
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,880
What's the matter with you?

439
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:13,190
I got her fancy man.

440
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,040
Dear Rong

441
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,560
I'm sorry to fail to keep an appointment.

442
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,920
I'd like to meet you again at Tianxiang Restaurant,

443
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,190
despite risks I may take

444
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:25,830
Please be cautious.

445
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,310
"Dear Rong"

446
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,640
So intimate.

447
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:34,070
They have gone too far.

448
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,520
I'd like to see

449
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:38,710
the guy who dares

450
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:39,950
to take Rong

451
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:40,950
from me.

452
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:57,070
My Lord

453
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,350
Why hasn't he come yet?

454
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:00,110
Rong is looking forward to him.

455
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,470
Feng

456
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,880
There you are finally.

457
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:08,760
Sit down, please.

458
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,560
You didn't come last time.

459
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,110
I'm afraid you won't come this time.

460
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,470
The world

461
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:19,800
is turbulent.

462
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:21,640
Personal loyalty

463
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,520
is the most important to me.

464
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,280
Something

465
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,710
is beyond our control.

466
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:30,310
That's why you're more admirable.

467
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:33,640
Rong

468
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:35,310
Did you come here

469
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,190
alone this time?

470
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,550
You're not followed or suspected, right?

471
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,330
Don't worry, Feng.

472
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:42,640
I know you're wary.

473
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,830
So I assigned my servant to wait outside.

474
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,000
If someone comes,

475
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,280
she will tell me right away.

476
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:49,040
You are

477
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,230
so thoughtful.

478
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,830
You are more thoughtful.

479
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:55,230
Feng,

480
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,520
You're much mightier

481
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,040
than last time I saw you.

482
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,430
You must have done something for the public good

483
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,520
To curb the violent and

484
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,800
assist the weak is our responsibility.

485
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,590
Feng,

486
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:08,190
You're the bravest man I've ever seen.

487
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:09,950
I wonder if I have

488
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:12,110
the chance to share your burdens.

489
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,760
That's simple.

490
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:16,070
Since you are

491
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,000
so enthusiastic,

492
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,160
I won't let you down.

493
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:22,710
Feng,

494
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:24,070
we have the deal

495
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,310
after this meal.

496
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,520
You can't go back on your word.

497
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,520
I'll never do that.

498
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:33,950
But, you, being a girl,

499
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:36,310
should be cautious

500
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:38,280
wherever you go in Jianghu.

501
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,000
I'll teach you

502
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,230
how, OK?

503
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:45,680
Feng,

504
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,230
No time like the present.

505
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:48,230
You can teach me today.

506
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,070
I didn't expect

507
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:53,230
you to be so impatient.

508
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,470
Who's there?

509
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,950
Maybe someone is drinking.

510
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:00,950
Come on, Feng.

511
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,400
Why not

512
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,590
go somewhere else?

513
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:10,110
Then we won't be disturbed by those men.

514
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:14,560
My Lord

515
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:15,760
There's no sound.

516
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:21,070
My Lord

517
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:21,430
My Lord

518
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,710
I saw Rong get on a carriage

519
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:23,590
and go to the suburbs.

520
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,190
Rong could be in danger.

521
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,400
Gather all men.

522
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,000
OK.

523
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,470
You're so vigilant,

524
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:41,230
perceptive of even the slightest.

525
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:43,680
More people

526
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,430
means more chances to be seen.

527
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:46,470
You can never be too careful.

528
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:48,400
When we get to my place

529
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:50,920
we will do whatever we want.

530
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,800
Your place?

531
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,070
You mean

532
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:55,400
we're going to

533
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,560
to your gang now.

534
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,040
Are you happy?

535
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,710
Yes. Yes.

536
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:15,110
I didn't expect here is an altogether different world

537
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:16,430
below the residence.

538
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:17,230
Isn't it amazing?

539
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:19,070
It's the secret contact place

540
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:20,160
of the gang.

541
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,160
Non one is allowed in

542
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,190
except the most trusted.

543
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:25,400
Rong,

544
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,190
You're the first girl

545
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:28,230
I've brought in.

546
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,470
Really?

547
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,470
My Lord,

548
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:46,190
they're in there.

549
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,760
Tell them to stand by outside.

550
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,560
Clear the periphery

551
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,590
in a radius of 5 kilometers.

552
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:52,710
Got it.

553
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,000
My Lord.

554
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:00,800
Rong!

555
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,280
My Lord

556
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,350
That's impossible.

557
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,350
I have men surrounding the building.

558
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,160
They couldn't get out.

559
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:07,710
Right.

560
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:13,280
My Lord,

561
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,640
this is the mark of the South Desolation Spy.

562
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,640
There must be a secret passage here.

563
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:21,160
Find it!

564
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:21,430
On my way.

565
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:21,880
Yes, My Lord.

566
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:36,040
Nobody has ever

567
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,800
brought people here?

568
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:40,400
I guess no one has

569
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,400
the courage except me.

570
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,160
You're really something.

571
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:46,760
But

572
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,280
what's so

573
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,280
special about the Mister?

574
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:49,950
Even you,

575
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:52,160
an indomitable hero, are afraid of him.

576
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:53,760
Naturally,

577
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,760
Mister is to be respected.

578
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,310
However,

579
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:01,880
I don't think the Mister

580
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,640
will resist a beautiful girl

581
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,040
like you

582
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,800
either.

583
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,470
- Then...
- Hush...

584
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,800
Don't spoil our mood.

585
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,590
It's quiet here.

586
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,560
Just you and me alone.

587
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:18,920
Let's not waste it?

588
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,280
Feng,

589
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,400
your Mister is coming.

590
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,190
Nobody here.

591
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:29,110
What's that?

592
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,280
It's my secret Knockout Powder

593
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,000
made with ten spices.

594
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:32,920
How do you feel?

595
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,880
Feeling limp

596
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,950
and paralyzed, right?

597
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,110
Damn girl.

598
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,000
How dare you lie to me!

599
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,070
You deserve it.

600
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:38,590
Get down.

601
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,160
Tell me the truth.

602
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:41,520
Who's your Mister?

603
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,590
Any accomplices?

604
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:54,880
Did you see it, Lord?

605
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:56,950
Her Highness has taken him down.

606
00:24:59,190 --> 00:24:59,950
But My Lord

607
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:01,000
it seems that Her Highness

608
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,950
is locked up inside, too.

609
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,520
No way. It...

610
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,400
Find the switch.

611
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:17,950
So effective.

612
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:20,350
Dare you touch my hand.

613
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,710
Dare you hold me round the waist.

614
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:22,830
What about now?

615
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:27,640
Why is the door closed?

616
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,000
That's so annoying.

617
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:38,400
No way.

618
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:40,110
It's not the ganger, is it?

619
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:41,950
Whatever.

620
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:43,190
Going out is the most important.

621
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,830
Are you all right, Feng?

622
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:50,430
Is anybody there?

623
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:52,590
Feng was badly hurt.

624
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:54,880
He's bleeding, trickling.

625
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,310
He's gonna die without immediate treatment.

626
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,110
My Lord,

627
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:59,350
Her Highness is acting hard.

628
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,400
Time to fool her.

629
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:00,920
A prank.

630
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,950
Feng,

631
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:07,000
hold on, please.

632
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,710
The Mister will come and get us out.

633
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,280
Stop yelling, girl.

634
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:13,950
Who are you?

635
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:14,800
Where are you?

636
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,190
Please get us out.

637
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:17,920
You're so bold.

638
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,680
Do you know where you broke into?

639
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,160
Of course.

640
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:23,040
I came here with Feng

641
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,680
because I admired him.

642
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,310
You like him so much?

643
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:28,950
How about your family

644
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:30,760
and your husband?

645
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:34,400
Don't say that, Mister.

646
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,350
I haven't got married.

647
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,920
I have no husband.

648
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:38,680
Who's

649
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:40,830
Qin Shangcheng?

650
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,640
Qin Shangcheng

651
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,280
How did you know him?

652
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,800
If he knows his wife fell for

653
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,110
another man

654
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,310
how does he feel?

655
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:50,830
Bah!

656
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:51,680
If it wasn’t for investigating into

657
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,040
you South Desolation Spies

658
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:53,640
I wouldn't give him

659
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,190
a second glance.

660
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,400
You knew he was the South Desolation Spy already?

661
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:00,830
Of course.

662
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:02,430
I knew it at first sight.

663
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:04,760
Love.

664
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:06,640
So all you did

665
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:09,070
is to help Qin Shangcheng.

666
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,110
He's my husband.

667
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:13,560
I'd risk my life for him.

668
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,560
It's love.

669
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,760
You did so much for him.

670
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,040
But he knew nothing.

671
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,950
You're so gossipy.

672
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,430
You won't get anything out of me.

673
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:27,710
Kill me if you can

674
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:29,160
Anyway, I will never...

675
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,640
My Lord,

676
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,190
There's no sound.

677
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,680
Rong

678
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,470
Rong

679
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:44,280
Rong

680
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:46,070
How's it going?

681
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,590
Fine.

682
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,760
She was just poisoned.

683
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,350
My Lord

684
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:54,110
What about that man?

685
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,470
Tie him up.

686
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,400
I'll interrogate him myself.

687
00:27:58,830 --> 00:27:59,470
Speak or die.

688
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,400
Stop, two heroes.

689
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,000
I'll tell the truth.

690
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,590
Where's the antidote?

691
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:04,470
Antidote is here.

692
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:04,800
Where is it?

693
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,830
In my pocket.

694
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:06,230
Take it out.

695
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,520
How?

696
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,880
I beg your mercy.

697
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:13,680
My Lord, the antidote.

698
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:14,950
Mr. hero

699
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:15,830
Mr. hero

700
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:17,230
I really don't know who this girl is.

701
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:18,710
If I know who she is

702
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:20,710
I wouldn't dare to look at her.

703
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:21,280
Mr. hero

704
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,830
But you did look at her

705
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:25,160
and you hurt her.

706
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:25,880
I...

707
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,920
You have a chance to convince me

708
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,110
to spare your life

709
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:30,830
Mr. hero

710
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:32,400
I'm nothing.

711
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,040
I have nothing but my life.

712
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,110
How about slaving for you?

713
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,000
Work like a horse?

714
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,110
Zhang Xian

715
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:43,800
What do we do to animals on our island?

716
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,520
Bake it with oil.

717
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:49,400
I'm hungry.

718
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,920
No no no.

719
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,110
Ye

720
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:56,800
Ye

721
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:01,400
Ye?

722
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,160
Yes.

723
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,000
She's the head of South Desolation Spies

724
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:05,680
in Mingzhou Prefecture.

725
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:11,000
Keep questioning him.

726
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,230
until he tell everything he knows.

727
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:14,470
Got it.

728
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:16,680
Speak up.

729
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,710
Stop. I'll tell you everything.

730
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:19,920
I'll tell you.

731
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,800
I'll tell you everything.

732
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:22,000
Everything.

733
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:36,800
My Lord

734
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:38,040
If her Highness wakes up

735
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,470
tomorrow morning and

736
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:40,430
feels something wrong,

737
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:41,880
how can we explain it to her?

738
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,400
Where am I?

739
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:22,040
Rong

740
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,040
Finally you're awake.

741
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,640
Uncle Wei

742
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,830
Where am I?

743
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:29,920
I'm the governor of Mingzhou.

744
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:31,190
Here is

745
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:33,190
the state office.

746
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,160
So

747
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,950
you saved me last night.

748
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:41,560
You're amazing.

749
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,950
You inquired into the den of South Desolation

750
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:46,070
alone last night and got

751
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:47,680
the invisible sentry Feng Er.

752
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,590
You made great contributions.

753
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,160
How about the man

754
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,230
interrogating me outside?

755
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,070
We caught him, too.

756
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:58,310
Now

757
00:30:58,310 --> 00:31:00,430
He has been sent to the capital for trial.

758
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:01,830
That's good.

759
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:02,310
Well.

760
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:03,190
Rong

761
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:06,110
I asked Lord Qin for help

762
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,350
because I knew he is martial master

763
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,920
and experienced.

764
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:11,680
But I've never thought

765
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:13,800
you had such talent.

766
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:15,310
The token

767
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,350
is a reward for you.

768
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:20,350
I hope you can participate in

769
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:21,950
the following investigations.

770
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,520
I wonder if you'd want to.

771
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,710
Yes, I do.

772
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,000
Then I'll be Qin's colleague.

773
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,520
Sure.

774
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,680
Moreover

775
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,950
I'll give you

776
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:32,880
the first task

777
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,400
today.

778
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:35,430
OK.

779
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,230
The time and place are all written on it.

780
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,110
Hold it.

781
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:40,350
Remember.

782
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,430
Pay attention to your own safety.

783
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,520
Thanks, Uncle Wei.

784
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:45,470
Go ahead.

785
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:45,950
OK.

786
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:55,160
Thank you for

787
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:56,310
helping me, Mr. Wei.

788
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,280
Don't mention it.

789
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,880
My pleasure

790
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:01,430
But

791
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,190
why not

792
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,190
explain it to her yourself,

793
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:06,190
since you

794
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:07,430
took care of

795
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,920
her all night?

796
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,950
Zhang Xian has set off to catch Ye.

797
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,160
Rong is impetuous

798
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,310
and injured.

799
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,160
I just want her to feel at ease and recover,

800
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,070
rather than take a risk alone again.

801
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,590
She wants to help you.

802
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:26,310
You want to protect her.

803
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,350
Things between the young couple

804
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,350
are too complicated.

805
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:33,760
After this,

806
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,880
I know Rong's mind.

807
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,400
When I close the case,

808
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,310
I'll tell her everything.

809
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,920
The knot in my heart

810
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,400
has come loosened.

811
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:45,880
Rong

812
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,800
You're back.

813
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:50,400
You've...

814
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:52,310
Why not go back to have a rest?

815
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:53,230
Do you mean I lost weight?

816
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:54,430
That's good.

817
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,830
Why are you so happy?

818
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,400
Nothing special.

819
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,520
I feel happy because

820
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,800
we can fight

821
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,470
side by side again.

822
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,310
You didn't have a good rest last night, did you?

823
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:06,760
I asked the cook to make you some

824
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,470
spirit-quieting decoction.

825
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,800
Don't worry.

826
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,800
I'm in such a good mood.

827
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,400
No more talking.

828
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,000
Swordwoman Huahua

829
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,520
has something more important to do.

830
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,190
Bye.

831
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:17,190
You little fool.

832
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,110
My Lord

833
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,110
My Lord

834
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,040
- Isn't she suspicious?
- Hush...

835
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,560
It's well for the time being.

836
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,310
What about Ye?

837
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,000
We've got Ye.

838
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,800
In the western criminal investigating system,

839
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,640
there's a way.

840
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,350
The lifestyle and working style

841
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:53,190
of the suspect can be inferred from the testimony

842
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:54,160
of the witness

843
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,400
including methods of personal cultivation.

844
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:58,710
It's amazing.

845
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,520
I'm lucky to have a smattering of it.

846
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,160
Just get to the point!

847
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,040
Just get to the point!

848
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:05,590
Lord doesn't understand it.

849
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:06,230
I don't understand, either.

850
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:07,350
You even light the candles

851
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:08,469
to create an atmosphere

852
00:34:08,469 --> 00:34:09,389
like the westerners.

853
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:12,800
My Lord

854
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,560
All in all,

855
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,710
generally speaking,

856
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:17,120
we can draw a picture of

857
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,840
the suspect according to

858
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,870
the type of man her Highness likes.

859
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:21,320
And widen the net.

860
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:22,710
Well.

861
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:24,389
What kind of man does she like?

862
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,600
When her Highness and me went shopping that day

863
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,670
I heard that

864
00:34:28,949 --> 00:34:29,710
Rong liked

865
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:31,120
the man who had

866
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,870
a Roman nose,

867
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,600
a full forehead,

868
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:36,760
plump lips,

869
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:38,280
and curly hair.

870
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,710
The most important is that

871
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,600
he should have dimples when he smiles.

872
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:42,560
You know.

873
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,710
That's Qin for sure!

874
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:44,000
Look!

875
00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:45,630
Look! Look!

876
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,670
That's true.

877
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:50,429
It seems that the perfect man in

878
00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:51,469
her heart is Qin.

879
00:34:51,469 --> 00:34:52,600
Don't worry, My Lord.

880
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,360
No man can beat you

881
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,520
in Rong's heart.

882
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,520
Nevertheless

883
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:02,230
I won't let go of any man

884
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:03,600
who covets Rong.

885
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,120
Got it!

886
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,320
Go ahead with the plan tomorrow.

887
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:08,560
OK.

888
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:14,950
Qian

889
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,710
Did Rong really say that?

890
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:17,840
Of course.

891
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:19,190
As he wish.

892
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,080
Saying what Lord wishes

893
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,150
is nothing less than cheating

894
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:23,230
How can this be called cheating?

895
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:24,760
What kind of man does Rong like?

896
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:26,950
Qin

897
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:27,870
That's all.

898
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:28,910
Let me tell you.

899
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,600
Qin doesn't believe that

900
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,800
Rong like others.

901
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,710
But Rong doesn't tell Qin what she thinks.

902
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:35,560
So Qin must be uncomfortable.

903
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,040
Right?

904
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:36,840
Shouldn't we make him

905
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,430
happy as his best friends?

906
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:39,560
Happy.

907
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:41,910
Happy.

908
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:45,190
Any more questions?
