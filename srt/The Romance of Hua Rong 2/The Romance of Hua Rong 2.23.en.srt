[EP23]

3
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:38,400
I knew

4
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,630
I couldn't get out of here today.

5
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:40,910
But this drawing of cannon,

6
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,950
will never be in the hands of Wanjiang.

7
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:43,720
This guy

8
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,630
looks like a harmless sheep,

9
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,310
but he is really a wolf in sheep's clothing.

10
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:48,800
Did you kill Master Yi?

11
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:50,630
Is Hua Rong acting or not?

12
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,759
Words are but wind,

13
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:52,830
but seeing is believing.

14
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,590
Give your life to me!

15
00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:57,190
Couples quarrel, no disturbing.

16
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:58,120
Rong,

17
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,590
do you really need to say that?

18
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,910
Dealing with people like Jin Tong,

19
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:03,760
We have to make the quarrel look real.

20
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,000
Your Highness,

21
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,160
Empress Dowager suddenly fell ill.

22
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,080
Your Highness and Ms. Hua Rong are summoned to meet her.

23
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,030
Didn't Grandma just come back from the temple?

24
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,800
Why would she fall ill suddenly?

25
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,190
The Empress Dowager always as fit as a fiddle.

26
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,550
But today she heard that

27
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,079
Your Highness and Ms. Hua Rong wanted to get a divorce.

28
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,720
Then she was so worried

29
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,910
that fell ill.

30
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,110
Has she seen the doctor?

31
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,160
Yes.

32
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,160
The doctor said

33
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,600
it's a psychological problem

34
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,240
which needs psychological treatment.

35
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,910
I'll leave first.

36
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,240
Rong?

37
00:02:56,829 --> 00:02:57,750
Where's Cheng?

38
00:02:58,910 --> 00:02:59,750
Cheng?

39
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,360
Cheng.

40
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:04,750
Cheng, you've come to see me.

41
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,440
You've come to see me.

42
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,600
Grandma,

43
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,910
stop pretending.

44
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,390
What did you say?

45
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:14,830
I can't hear clearly.

46
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,270
Oh my ears...

47
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:17,910
I can't hear anything.

48
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:18,670
Grandma,

49
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,750
if you go on like this,

50
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,630
you'll really get ill.

51
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,630
Right, right.

52
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:25,880
Fine, fine.

53
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,720
No pretending.

54
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:30,630
You two are smart.

55
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:32,190
I can't fool you.

56
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,910
Don't blame grandma for lying to you.

57
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,550
Grandma is getting old

58
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,000
and may pass away anytime.

59
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,160
I'm thinking

60
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,800
when I am alive,

61
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,079
I can see my kids

62
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,440
are living good lives.

63
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,600
Bai's life is uncertain.

64
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:49,670
You two

65
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:52,720
can't hurt me anymore.

66
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:57,520
Here,

67
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:58,160
Rong.

68
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,110
I am sure

69
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,630
you're my granddaughter-in-law.

70
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,550
As long as I am alive,

71
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,080
you can't be apart.

72
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,190
Don't worry, grandma.

73
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,800
This time, Rong

74
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,960
will certainly appreciate your gift.

75
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,670
Grandma,

76
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,470
Duanmu Bai

77
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,440
was saved by one of my sworn sisters.

78
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,480
He's under medical treatment now.

79
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,040
I promise you,

80
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,070
I'll ask him to see you

81
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,000
as soon as he recovers.

82
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,200
Really?

83
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,230
How could we lie to you?

84
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,390
Great!

85
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,040
Didn't you

86
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,640
plan to get a divorce?

87
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,000
This is

88
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,159
a long story.

89
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,790
But as long as you know that

90
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:37,920
what we are doing

91
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,230
is for the sake of peace between the two countries.

92
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,110
There will be no harm to South Desolation.

93
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:41,720
That's all.

94
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:43,640
Got it.

95
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,920
Got it.

96
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:48,440
If I don't trust my grandson and granddaughter-in-law,

97
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,040
I don't know who I can trust.

98
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:50,270
Right.

99
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,390
By the way, grandma,

100
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,270
it's not convenient for me and Rong

101
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:54,920
to meet alone now.

102
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,920
I hope you can leave a side room for us,

103
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,510
so that we can avoid surveillance

104
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,390
and meet under the name of visiting you.

105
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,510
A side room? No!

106
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,880
I'll put you both in a couple's suite

107
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,830
in Tianchi Pavilion.

108
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:12,830
Grandma.

109
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,760
Rong is shy, isn't she?

110
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,550
General Jin,

111
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,720
Hua Rong and Qing Shangcheng have been officially divorced.

112
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,920
I saw her tear up the marriage certificate
with my own eyes.

113
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,070
Everyone knew about it,

114
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,230
and even the Empress Dowager was ill for that.

115
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,110
Well, it turns out Hua Rong isn't lying.

116
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,270
I think so.

117
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,110
But there's one thing I don't understand.

118
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,320
Qin Shangcheng knew

119
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:39,110
Yi Feichi is killed by you.

120
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,320
Why didn't he confront you?

121
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,230
It's simple.

122
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,950
He was going to go ahead

123
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:48,070
and pretend he already has half of the drawing of cannon,

124
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,640
and use it as leverage

125
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,440
to draw forth the other half from Hua Rong.

126
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:52,920
It's reasonable.

127
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,640
I guess

128
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,000
Qin Shangcheng's next move is

129
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,000
probably going to exchange drawing with Hua Rong.

130
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,160
It's time to go find Hua Rong.

131
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,320
Why did you find time

132
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,550
to have tea with me today?

133
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,440
I come to ask after you

134
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,110
because I worry that you are affected

135
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:14,390
by Empress Dowager's illness.

136
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,600
I see you feel ill at ease.

137
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,720
Do you hesitate

138
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,390
due to Empress Dowager?

139
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,320
I do feel guilty about grandmother.

140
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,040
But the national interest trumps all else.

141
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:28,000
I have divorced Qin Shangcheng

142
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,070
without hesitation.

143
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,440
Then what's bothering you?

144
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,670
Qin Shangcheng offered to trade half of his drawing

145
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:39,830
for half of mine,

146
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,230
and then we share the drawing.

147
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,440
I wonder if there's a catch.

148
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,670
I think

149
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,390
you can agree.

150
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,550
Don't get me wrong.

151
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,350
You don't have to give Qin Shangcheng

152
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,920
the real drawing.

153
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,200
There are lots of able men in South Desolation.

154
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,790
Qin Shangcheng will find experts to identify.

155
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,160
We can make just a few minor adjustments.

156
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,110
It is the so called

157
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,480
a miss is as

158
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,350
good as a mile.

159
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:06,790
Don't worry.

160
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,440
My Lieutenant General, Wu Ren,

161
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,510
used to be in firearms camp.

162
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:10,920
He is loyal to me,

163
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:12,200
so he is the most suitable person.

164
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,670
You guy?

165
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,950
Don't have a suspicion, sister.

166
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,550
I don't have the drawing,

167
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,720
and it's useless for me to see this half.

168
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:21,110
Besides,

169
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,320
I have already proposed that

170
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:25,070
Wanjiang is willing to share the drawing with Tianchu

171
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,480
to jointly restrict South Desolation.

172
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,440
Okay.

173
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:31,670
That's a deal.

174
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,000
I offer the drawing,

175
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,720
and you offer the person.

176
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,550
After it's done,

177
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:35,390
we share it.

178
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,600
But it's an important thing.

179
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,790
I want to choose

180
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:40,790
the time and place.

181
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,200
It's up to you.

182
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:44,320
Have a cup of tea.

183
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,510
It is so ingenious.

184
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,920
Your grandson will love it.

185
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,480
No.

186
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,230
Tomorrow,

187
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,790
I need you to get a drum skin

188
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:01,320
at the Music Shop on the south side of city.

189
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,950
Yes, Empress Dowager.

190
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,480
Here comes His Majesty!

191
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,110
Queen mother!

192
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:08,070
Queen mother!

193
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:08,550
Mother...

194
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:09,950
Queen mother,

195
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:11,920
weren't you...

196
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,000
I pretended.

197
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,350
Can't I?

198
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,390
Since queen mother is healthy,

199
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,550
I'll leave first.

200
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,720
Come back!

201
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,790
Are you still angry with me?

202
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:25,350
Since you became the Emperor,

203
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,550
you haven't had dinner with me.

204
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:28,480
Today,

205
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,200
you have dinner with me.

206
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,549
Don't just eat vegetables.

207
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,760
You've been working day and night.

208
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,280
Take some fish to refresh yourself.

209
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:47,670
Queen mother,

210
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,590
I don't want to eat fish.

211
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,350
Besides, recently,

212
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:53,960
I am blazing of heart-liver fire.

213
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:56,200
I'd better eat more vegetables.

214
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,030
Eat as your will.

215
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,840
Speaking of which,

216
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,840
those fishing rods you sent me

217
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,030
are rotting.

218
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,080
I am

219
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:15,910
getting old.

220
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,440
I should get more exercise.

221
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,150
How about I go fishing

222
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,960
with you tomorrow?

223
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:28,640
Queen mother is going fishing with me.

224
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,470
I would love to.

225
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,440
Queen mother,

226
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:34,840
I'm full.

227
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,880
I'll take my leave.

228
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,590
Empress Dowager,

229
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:48,640
the Emperor's favorite food is grilled fish
since childhood.

230
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,030
Why did he suddenly say that?

231
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,400
How are you doing with the drawing of cannon?

232
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,320
His Highness said he had a plan of his own.

233
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,550
I dare not interfere too much.

234
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,030
You can catch a big fish with a long line,

235
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,640
but you may also lose the bait.

236
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,030
I want you to keep an eye on this,

237
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:06,910
just in case.

238
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:07,880
Yes, Your Majesty.

239
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,470
I wonder if Your Majesty has been
losing appetite recently.

240
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,350
I know you like to read my mind.

241
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,150
But there are things

242
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,440
you shouldn't ask.

243
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,760
I am sorry.

244
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,590
General Wu Ren, please focus on the drawing.

245
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,840
General Jin and General Hua Jr.,

246
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,670
please leave for a second.

247
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:55,640
Sister,

248
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,150
the drawing is exquisite.

249
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,670
Wu Ren needs to concentrate on

250
00:10:58,670 --> 00:10:59,640
the drawing process

251
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,910
without any interference.

252
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:02,590
Hope you can understand.

253
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:06,520
In his cautious nature,

254
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,440
before copying half of our drawing,

255
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,470
he would combine the two

256
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,440
and give them to Wu Ren for identification.

257
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:12,710
That would be

258
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,520
the best time

259
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,470
to get a full drawing.

260
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:15,790
Right.

261
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,840
And just give me a few minutes,

262
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,350
I can remember the full drawing.

263
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,790
Jin Tong must have learned about

264
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,790
your photographic memory from Jin Yiwen.

265
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:24,790
So this time...

266
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:25,350
Right.

267
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,520
I won't bother you.

268
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,200
Just leave it to me.

269
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,150
Are you going to copy the whole drawing?

270
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:32,840
As for remembering something else,

271
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,840
I might not be as good as you.

272
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:35,030
But memorizing a drawing,

273
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,840
that's what pirates do.

274
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,350
Trust is the foundation

275
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:41,350
for bilateral cooperation.

276
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,030
How can I not see the point?

277
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,880
Then thanks General Wu Ren.

278
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,080
Thanks.

279
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:08,440
General Jin,

280
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,350
Roughly how long it will take General Wu Ren to draw?

281
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:12,710
Half an hour is enough.

282
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,110
It should be halfway there by now.

283
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,670
Why hasn't Qin Shangcheng come yet?

284
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,640
How do you think Qin

285
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,230
will get the drawing?

286
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,640
I wouldn't have gone to so much trouble.

287
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,150
I will just run in and grab it!

288
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:33,000
How could the Lord be as stupid as you?

289
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,840
He must stand on rooftops

290
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,760
with binoculars,

291
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,910
watching Wu Ren drawing it,

292
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:39,150
and then memorizing it in his head.

293
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,400
That's the best way.

294
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,030
Do you know it?

295
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:43,880
My lord.

296
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,280
Sit down.

297
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,880
Your Highness,

298
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,400
what are you doing?

299
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,840
Don't you know it clearly?

300
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,110
Why does he have a whole drawing?

301
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,550
Doesn't Your Highness have half of it?

302
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:25,910
Qin Shangcheng,

303
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,030
so this is how you do it.

304
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,790
It's so direct and arrogant.

305
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,520
I like it!

306
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,030
If it hadn't been for your cooperation,

307
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:34,030
it wouldn't have gone so smoothly.

308
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,110
So you couple pretended to fight with each other,

309
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,760
but secretly working together.

310
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,550
You are a good actress.

311
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:41,640
You, too.

312
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,960
Haven't you always been acting, too?

313
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,880
We're just

314
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,000
fighting fire with fire.

315
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,880
You seem to be trying to

316
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,150
make an enemy of Wanjiang

317
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,320
instead of peace talks.

318
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,840
On the contrary,

319
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,000
we're doing this

320
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,400
for real peace talks.

321
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:04,760
Your Highness,

322
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,640
how do you explain this to His Majesty?

323
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,670
I have my own plan.

324
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,520
Qin Shangcheng,

325
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:09,790
you burned the map,

326
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:10,840
you burned all of us.

327
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,880
When war returns,

328
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,790
what can you rely on?

329
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,760
Only when the drawing is gone

330
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,960
can we have a chance for genuine
trilateral peace talks,

331
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:27,150
and can we have the real peace.

332
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:29,880
You pissed me off so much.

333
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,200
I'm afraid we can't talk.

334
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:33,910
Peace talks are major events of the three countries.

335
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,440
Do you have the final say alone?

336
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:36,710
General Jin,

337
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,200
I have written a letter to

338
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,640
your brother about it.

339
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,670
If you continue to go your own way

340
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:42,960
and affect the plan for the three countries,

341
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,550
you will be an eternal sinner,

342
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,280
and then there won't be room for you in Wanjiang.

343
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,280
How dare you!

344
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,350
How dare you threaten our General Jin!

345
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,640
If it weren't Wanjiang,

346
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,590
your capital would be occupied by South Desolation!

347
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,080
General Jin,

348
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,110
forget the peace talks!

349
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,520
Return to Wanjiang immediately

350
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,670
to tell His Majesty about this!

351
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,230
Enough!

352
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:00,910
You don't get to talk here!

353
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,000
I will never forget

354
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,710
what happened today.

355
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,280
Let's go!

356
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:32,440
Fishing is about peace of mind.

357
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:34,840
You seem to have something on your mind.

358
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,230
Queen mother,

359
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,550
I have been very busy recently.

360
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,320
I didn't sleep well last night.

361
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,110
Don't be worried too much.

362
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,110
Oh, right,

363
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,350
this is the Roselle soup

364
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:50,200
I had Nanny Duan make.

365
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,670
It can calm the nerves.

366
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:53,710
Have a taste.

367
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,110
Thanks, queen mother.

368
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,640
You are not my son!

369
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,640
Once drink Roselle soup, Duanmu's family

370
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,710
will have red neck.

371
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,640
Guards!

372
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:15,960
Queen mother,

373
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:17,670
dead people

374
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,350
can't come anymore.

375
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:32,790
Who?

376
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:33,960
Who!

377
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:39,880
Who are you?

378
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:47,470
Kong Lin!

379
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,150
I didn't die!

380
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,760
If I kill you now,

381
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,710
the game will be boring.

382
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:56,200
When we were in Imperial Alliance,

383
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,910
you wanted to contend for the
last emperor's testamentary edict.

384
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,000
You...

385
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,000
It's exactly what you think.

386
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:04,430
But,

387
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:06,190
it's too late now.

388
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,230
I want you to see

389
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:10,069
the South Desolation change the emperor,

390
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:11,680
and your son claim me as his father.

391
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,710
Everything you own

392
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,430
will be mine.

393
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,680
He had taken medicine.

394
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,680
And I had cured his broken hamstring.

395
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,310
Every means had been tried.

396
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,350
He should have been recovered by now.

397
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,350
Why he still can't walk?

398
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,560
Now,

399
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,680
all I can hope for

400
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,520
is what Crab calls a wishing bottle.

401
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,190
Dreams do come true if you really believe.

402
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,880
All I want now

403
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,110
is that Duanmu Bai's leg

404
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:52,000
can recover soon.

405
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,110
If then he wants to leave,

406
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,830
I'll let him go.

407
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:04,350
Go and boil this medicine as soon as possible.

408
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:05,590
Okay.

409
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,350
Go.

410
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,520
Duanmu Bai!

411
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,680
What happened!

412
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:16,920
I was thirsty and hungry,

413
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,000
looking for something to eat.

414
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:21,710
How can you take care of yourself after leaving me?

415
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,310
It's so hard for you to eat a grape.

416
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,950
How can you leave?

417
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:27,680
If my leg gets better,

418
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,640
would you still take care of me like this?

419
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:31,920
At that time you can do anything you want.

420
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,880
You don't need me to take care of you.

421
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,230
Thanks.

422
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:46,710
How does it taste?

423
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:48,880
So sweet.

424
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:53,590
Your Highness,

425
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:54,520
Cra...

426
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,310
Crab's letter.

427
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,310
I didn't see anything.

428
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,070
I didn't know anything.

429
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:07,040
I'm not gonna say anything.

430
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:07,520
Shut up!

431
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,640
Bring me the letter.

432
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,160
What's wrong?

433
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,160
Crab said grandma fell into the water while fishing,

434
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:26,830
and now she is unconscious.

435
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,310
Mr. Duanmu,

436
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,950
you can walk!

437
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,590
When did your leg recover?

438
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:02,160
Three... Three...

439
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,400
Three days ago.

440
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,070
Why would you lie to me?

441
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,400
Oh, I know.

442
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:10,950
Do you think

443
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:11,830
I'm gonna kick you out

444
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:12,520
when your leg is healed?

445
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:13,830
You can't bear to leave me.

446
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,710
This is the face cream

447
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,000
with grape seeds as guiding drug,

448
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,830
which has the effect of activating blood stasis

449
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,070
and remove scars.

450
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,470
Do I have scars on my face?

451
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,070
Don't think too much.

452
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,830
I just don't want to owe you anything.

453
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,070
You owe me something

454
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:35,400
which should take a lifetime to pay.

455
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:02,560
Now grandma is in a coma,

456
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:04,350
and even the doctor could do nothing.

457
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,710
It seems that we had to wait for Duanmu Bai's return.

458
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,040
Your Highness,

459
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,470
the Empress Dowager's medicine is ready.

460
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:17,760
Why are you here?

461
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:18,710
Where is Nanny Duan?

462
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,040
In a rage, His Majesty

463
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,040
executed all the soldiers and maidservants

464
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,070
who had served the Empress Dowager.

465
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,950
Nanny Duan's whereabouts are still unknown.

466
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:25,950
Maybe she has fled.

467
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,470
Even Nanny Duan is dead.

468
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,310
Duanmu Qingcang must be hiding something.

469
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,310
Did he execute in a fit of rage?

470
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,800
Was he hiding the evidence?

471
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,070
There is something fishy about it.

472
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:53,520
I'm going to ask him face to face.

473
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,920
Mu Qing,

474
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,800
if you are alive,

475
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:05,950
you can see

476
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:08,070
Duanmu Qingcang is at odds with his son

477
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:09,230
and his brothers,

478
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:10,400
you can see

479
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,710
how I take Duanmu Qingcang's all lifelong business

480
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:13,880
at once,

481
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:15,680
and you can also see

482
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,880
your choice at that time was wrong!

483
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,590
It was wrong! Wrong!

484
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,400
How could you choose him?

485
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:29,000
Take a look! Take a look!

486
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,110
Now I have no one

487
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,590
to share my high position and great wealth with.

488
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,520
Soon,

489
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,110
I will send Duanmu Qingcang

490
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,070
to you very soon.

491
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,830
I want him to tell you

492
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,560
how he was trampled under my feet,

493
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,520
how I twist his son

494
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,880
around my fingers.

495
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,160
Around my little fingers!

496
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:51,310
My little fingers!

497
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,070
How could my grandma fall into the water?

498
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:00,310
Cheng,

499
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,520
don't make a noise

500
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,760
in front of your mother's secrificial tablet,

501
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,830
or else it will not be proper.

502
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,310
Dare you swear in front of her secrificial tablet

503
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,230
that grandma's drowning is really an accident?

504
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,470
Cheng,

505
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,110
I knew your heart aches for your grandma.

506
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:21,000
But my heart aches more than you.

507
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:23,280
Your mother

508
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,110
can see your filial piety.

509
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:26,000
She also can see

510
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,310
my determination to unify the world!

511
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:30,520
My mother hoped that

512
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:32,040
one day

513
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,680
you would wipe the blood from the blade,

514
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:36,560
and beat the swords into ploughshares.

515
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:41,040
Beat the swords into ploughshares.

516
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:42,760
Graze cows and horses on the grassland.

517
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:44,920
Every family no longer has the pain of lovesickness.

518
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,640
No worries about the war within a thousand year.

519
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,000
If you want to beat the swords into ploughshares,

520
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:52,800
there should be no wars in a thousand year.

521
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:53,710
Therefore,

522
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,110
you should understand

523
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:57,280
why I want to unify the world.

524
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,590
Well, Cheng,

525
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,590
did you get

526
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,760
the drawing of cannon?

527
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:09,160
The drawing was destroyed.

528
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,110
There's only one drawing in the whole world now.

529
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:14,800
It's in my mind.

530
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,430
You're threatening me?

531
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:18,040
It's you lied to me first.

532
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,040
I have asked Yi Feichi.

533
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,430
After I returned to Tianchu,

534
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:22,920
you were still forcing him to draw it.

535
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,350
You didn't want the peace talks at all.

536
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:28,830
You think

537
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:31,400
I'm really afraid to hurt you?

538
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:35,710
That depends on

539
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:37,560
whether you want the drawing or not.

540
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,760
But on one condition,

541
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,710
you need to sign an armistice,

542
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:43,830
and

543
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,950
get me and the Tianchu Mission

544
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,040
safely

545
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,640
out of the South Desolation.

546
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:56,560
You are indeed my son.

547
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,830
You even know how to balance things out.

548
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,040
I just don't want to be pushed around

549
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:04,950
or used.

550
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:21,590
Why is there a strange medicinal smell on him?

551
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,430
What's this?

552
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,760
It was found

553
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,160
in Nanny Duan's baggage.

554
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,760
I guess it's the toy grandma told Nanny Duan

555
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,070
to make for Daodao.

556
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:42,760
Your Highness,

557
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:44,070
be happy.

558
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:46,430
Rong,

559
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:47,640
don't be upset.

560
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:49,350
Duanmu Bai's medical skill is very good.

561
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,280
When he comes,

562
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,560
he can cure grandma.

563
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,190
Wait!

564
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:06,920
It sounds strange.

565
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,520
It was a suicide note written by Nanny Duan.

566
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:21,920
So grandma

567
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,760
had long suspected Duanmu Qingcang's identity,

568
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,430
and had asked him to go fishing with her

569
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:28,160
to try him with Roselle soup.

570
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,190
Nanny Duan heard that

571
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:31,310
all the people around Empress Dowager

572
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:32,590
died after the drowning accident.

573
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,160
She knew that she was going to die soon,

574
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:36,280
so she decided to write everything on it

575
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:37,560
to avenge the Empress Dowager.

576
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,640
Then,

577
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:40,800
is this a fake Duanmu Qingcang?

578
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,070
Exactly, yes!

579
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,110
- My Lord.
- My Lord.

580
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:49,040
This is a

581
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:50,560
fake Duanmu Qingcang.

582
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:02,950
My Lord,

583
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:03,830
what is this?

584
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:04,470
It has the smell of fish.

585
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:07,190
I recently smelled a strange medicinal smell

586
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:08,800
on Duanmu Qingcang.

587
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,160
So I went to the Spring-back Hall.

588
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:13,520
This is the ointment for burns and scalds,

589
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,190
which can eliminate pus and toxin,

590
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,590
and remove rotten skin.

591
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,590
It's the best drug to treat burns.

592
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,160
But Duanmu Qingcang was not injured recently,

593
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:22,880
let alone burned.

594
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,710
Burn...

595
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,070
Is it...

596
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:26,830
Yes.

597
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:28,110
It's Kong Lin.

598
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,280
Isn't he dead?

599
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,710
He's not dead.

600
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,590
He must have fled out of the secret chamber,

601
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,190
and sent his guys to assassinate us

602
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:38,710
the night of the jail delivery.

603
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:40,710
In this case,

604
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:41,680
Duanmu Qingcang was not the one

605
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,000
who broke the promise

606
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,350
and killed Zou Yitian,

607
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:45,110
but Kong Lin.

608
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:47,560
Is the real Duanmu Qingcang

609
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,430
dead?

610
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,280
He's in danger now at worst.

611
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:56,000
So if that's the case,

612
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,560
how can we prove this Duanmu Qingcang

613
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,000
is not the real one?

614
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,230
There's one person who's a breach.

615
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:17,040
Your Highness.

616
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:17,520
Don't.

617
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,110
Take a seat.

618
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:20,160
Thanks, Your Highness.

619
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,160
I've stayed in South Desolation so long,

620
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,710
But I've never heard you playing the Chinese zither.

621
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,400
I am not sorry for the pain in the player's heart,

622
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,280
but sad that no one can understand her pain.

623
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,560
Many accidents have taken place in the palace.

624
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:39,430
How can I play the zither?

625
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,310
This zither

626
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:46,950
is the Fumeng Zither from Wanjiang?

627
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,430
Surely nothing can escape your notice.

628
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:56,230
This zither is a rare treasure in Wanjiang.

629
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:58,280
I heard it was lost in the war.

630
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,520
I can't imagine that

631
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,000
it's in your hand.

632
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,400
So

633
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,550
are you from Wanjiang?

634
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:08,640
Of all that Your Highness has said,

635
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:10,560
the last sentence

636
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,950
is perhaps the key point?

637
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,160
Indeed,

638
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,560
I was born in Wanjiang.

639
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:18,470
Both my parents are zither player.

640
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:20,110
However, treacherous court officials of Wanjiang

641
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:22,430
accused my father of plotting rebellion in his songs.

642
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:24,070
My parents were killed.

643
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,400
I was exiled.

644
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,560
It's His Majesty

645
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:30,590
who cut off my bracelet and anklet,

646
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:31,880
and saved me.

647
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:36,000
If it wasn't for His Majesty,

648
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,680
I would have disappeared

649
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,800
like this Fumeng Zither.

650
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,800
In contrary to Your Highness,

651
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,920
I was born in Wanjiang,

652
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,160
but my heart

653
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,350
belongs to South Desolation.

654
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,640
Then

655
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:57,110
you know His Majesty better than I do.

656
00:29:58,190 --> 00:29:59,710
Don't you think His Majesty

657
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:01,680
is different from before?

658
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:03,040
What do you want to say?

659
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,040
This is a fake emperor.

660
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:05,590
Nonsense!

661
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,430
Our Shadow Guard only recognize
His Majesty's handprint.

662
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,640
It hasn't changed recently, how can he be fake?

663
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:13,430
Thanks a lot.

664
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,880
You let me know my father is alive.

665
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:19,190
What do you mean?

666
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:32,800
You can check for yourself.

667
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,280
The zither needs to be played more often,

668
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:40,280
so it can be adjusted

669
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,040
to have pleasant tweedle.

670
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:01,230
My Lord.

671
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,310
My Lord.

672
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:04,040
I'm back.

673
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:05,520
I have learned from My Lord

674
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,590
to take precautions.

675
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:08,190
I had soldiers sneak into South Desolation

676
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:08,950
before the tunnels were sealed.

677
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:09,830
Get to the point.

678
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:10,190
Okay.

679
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:11,520
The soldiers have figured it out that

680
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,880
now the capital is heavily guarded.

681
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,000
These places are

682
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,760
the Imperial Palace, the Secluded House, granaries,

683
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,230
firearms warehouse, and three major wharves.

684
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,950
My father must be in one of these places.

685
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:20,070
We must rescue him as soon as possible.

686
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:21,640
Tomorrow is the time for trilateral peace talks.

687
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,040
It's the best time to debunk Kong Lin in public.

688
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,520
If only Duanmu Bai were here,

689
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,350
he must know Kong Lin best.

690
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:30,000
Crab,

691
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:31,350
I brought him here.

692
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:33,760
Sis!

693
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,310
It is not too late?

694
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,830
You've come just at the right moment.

695
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:38,560
Where's Duanmu Bai?

696
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,560
He went to check on his grandmother.

697
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,710
Follow this prescription,

698
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,470
give medicine to the Empress Dowager every day.

699
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,040
Remember,

700
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,070
don't tell anyone

701
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,190
I have visited the Empress Dowager.

702
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,400
Yes.

703
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:53,560
You can leave.

704
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:05,430
Grandma,

705
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:07,310
I'm back.

706
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,590
Don't worry.

707
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:11,590
I will make you better.

708
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,470
I told you,

709
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,830
sooner or later,

710
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,560
you and I will have another drink together.

711
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,430
Since I can survive,

712
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:37,590
I can have a better life.

713
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,470
I saw you smile.

714
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:42,560
I guess grandma's all right.

715
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:44,830
Yes.

716
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,950
I have every confidence

717
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:47,920
that I can save grandma.

718
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,190
But how did grandma fall into the water?

719
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:52,160
What is going on?

720
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,560
Duanmu Qingcang

721
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,800
pushed grandma into the water.

722
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:57,280
Why?

723
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,590
Because this father

724
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:00,280
is pretended by Kong Lin.

725
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:03,520
Our guess is that Kong Lin escaped from
the secret chamber that day,

726
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,110
sneaked into the palace and captured our father.

727
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,470
Kong Lin first sent assassins to kill us,

728
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,110
and then pretend to be our father,

729
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:16,920
sent Fuqin to rescue me,

730
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,590
but not you.

731
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,040
His purpose

732
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:22,640
was to drive a wedge in our relationship.

733
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:24,830
He wants to torture our father

734
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:29,760
by turning us against each other.

735
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:31,640
You mean our father is still alive?

736
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,310
I know from Fuqin

737
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:37,680
that our father is still alive.

738
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,880
But it is not known where he is being held.

739
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,590
You know Kong Lin.

740
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:44,040
Do you have any clues?

741
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:52,040
Yes.

742
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:54,760
There are two places.

743
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:56,800
One

744
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,160
is the Secluded House,

745
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:00,350
which is the house

746
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:01,920
father gave Kong Lin.

747
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,470
That's where he taught me

748
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:04,680
kung fu and art of healing.

749
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,350
Kong Lin said that

750
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:08,360
all the machines in the place

751
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,800
were designed by himself,

752
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:10,949
and they were all impregnable.

753
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,389
If you put it that way,

754
00:34:13,949 --> 00:34:15,670
it's probably the place.

755
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,190
Another place is the Imperial Palace.

756
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,520
There is room in the palace for felons.

757
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,280
Perhaps Kong Lin took the opposite approach,

758
00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:24,080
thinking that the most dangerous place

759
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,389
is also the safest place.

760
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:26,949
So he just kept father

761
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,190
close to him.

762
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,429
Why don't we take action separately?

763
00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:31,040
You go to the Imperial Palace.

764
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,840
I go to the Secluded House.

765
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,630
Not now.

766
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:34,429
Both the Imperial Palace

767
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:35,520
and the Secluded House

768
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,190
are heavily guarded.

769
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:39,949
We only have one shot to save our father,

770
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,190
so we have to get it right the first time.

771
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:47,150
Peace talks will be held tomorrow.

772
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:49,840
The troops will be concentrated on
Prince Mu's Residence at that time.

773
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:51,360
Then,

774
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,630
whether it's the Imperial Palace,
or the Secluded House,

775
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:55,320
there will be chances.

776
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,390
What about the peace talks...

777
00:34:58,670 --> 00:34:59,710
I believe in Rong.

778
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,600
As long as they can stall for time
until we rescue our father,

779
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,710
we can turn the tables.

780
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:17,630
Your Majesty.

781
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:19,630
General Wu,

782
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:20,710
no need for this.

783
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:22,520
I wonder

784
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,320
what do you want from a foreign general?

785
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,430
I heard that General Wu's grandmother

786
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:28,150
is also a native of South Desolation.

787
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:30,670
Your Majesty is busy

788
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,710
but still have time to care about
a little guy like me.

789
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:35,470
Don't put yourself down, General Wu.

790
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:36,360
In the operation of

791
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,950
attacking our Luocheng,

792
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:39,150
you did a great job.

793
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:39,950
Besides,

794
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,190
you are proficient in firearms.

795
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,280
However,

796
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:44,080
you didn't become a vice general

797
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:46,670
until you were 40.

798
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:47,910
Aren't you

799
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:50,040
overqualified?

800
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:52,800
Your Majesty may speak frankly.

801
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:57,710
General Wu is indeed a straightforward man!

802
00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:00,190
Then let's get this straight.

803
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:02,150
At the peace talks tomorrow,

804
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:04,150
I want you

805
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,230
to kill someone for me.

806
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:10,120
Then the position of the General
of the South Desolation

807
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:12,520
will be vacant.

808
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,040
Rong,

809
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:48,520
are you worried that

810
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:50,150
something unexpected will happen tomorrow?

811
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:56,560
I am thinking

812
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,040
even though I used to be mediocre,

813
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:00,840
I was not afraid of anything.

814
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:02,040
I always said

815
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,630
I want to fight with you side by side.

816
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,320
Now my kung fu is as good as you,

817
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,280
but I became obsessed with gain and loss.

818
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,000
That's because you are a mother now.

819
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,710
You naturally think about it a little bit more.

820
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:18,430
In that case,

821
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:21,190
I am a bad mother.

822
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,520
After getting pregnant,

823
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:26,080
I never gave Daodao even one peaceful day.

824
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:36,670
Do you remember, Rong?

825
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,360
I promised you that

826
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:40,630
no matter after you married me

827
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:42,230
or had kids,

828
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:44,080
you can still be yourself,

829
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,080
you can still be that

830
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,600
dauntless Swordswoman Huahua

831
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:49,360
who has a strong sense of justice

832
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,950
and ready to help the weak.

833
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:54,390
Actually,

834
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:55,430
Daodao

835
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:57,600
won't become our biggest concern,

836
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:00,360
but our greatest motivator

837
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:01,870
and spiritual support.

838
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:04,710
Right,

839
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:06,120
mother is powerful.

840
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:07,430
Whether it is for Daodao

841
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:08,760
or for the people of the world,

842
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,150
whether there are immense difficulties or dangers,

843
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:11,390
we have to get through it

844
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:12,560
and win the final victory.

845
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:16,000
That sounds like Swordswoman Huahua.

846
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,040
No,

847
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,390
I can't.

848
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:41,360
It's okay,

849
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,320
Qin Shangcheng.

850
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,080
We're just putting on a show

851
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,120
to fool Jin Tong.

852
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,080
Haven't we tricked Fuqin before?

853
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,520
I can act.

854
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,870
But if I need to speak out your shortcomings

855
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:54,840
and pretend to divorce you,

856
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:56,190
I really can't do that.

857
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:58,560
Because you don't have any shortcomings.

858
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,190
How is that possible?

859
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:05,630
It's impossible to have no shortcomings.

860
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,520
It's just because you love me.

861
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,840
In my eyes and in my heart,

862
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,520
you are perfect,

863
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,320
without any shortcomings.

864
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:18,190
Then you can make up two.

865
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,280
It's fake anyway.

866
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,390
I will not believe.

867
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,080
Well, I'll just say two shortcomings,

868
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:23,950
but they're made up.

869
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:25,040
You certainly won't be angry,

870
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:25,320
will you?

871
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:25,950
Yes.

872
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:28,040
Then, Rong,

873
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,360
I'll say.

874
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,000
Your shortcoming is

875
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:34,120
being so beautiful

876
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,560
that makes me fascinated.

877
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:38,630
I didn't know I was that beautiful.

878
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,080
Then have a guess.

879
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:43,800
What's my shortcoming?

880
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:44,950
What's that?

881
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,430
I'm short of you.

882
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,670
You are so cute!

883
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,670
Love you so much!
