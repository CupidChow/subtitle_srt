[The Romance of Hua Rong 2]
[EP16]

3
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,120
What should I do

4
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,630
to get Rong back?

5
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,360
I'm not interested in.

6
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,120
My Lord,

7
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,160
in Her Highness's heart,

8
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,440
Duanmu Bai, the bastard,

9
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,550
is more important than us.

10
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:48,360
It is useless no matter how many efforts we make.

11
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:48,830
White Dove,

12
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:50,590
you are my fiancée.

13
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:52,310
Once we get the Rapier,

14
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,360
we'll get married.

15
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,680
Rong is my congenial sister.

16
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,479
I'll certainly help her.

17
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,270
To win or lose does not matter.

18
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:01,040
Thanks.

19
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,120
It's unbelievable that King Pirate

20
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,870
should turn to us for a woman.

21
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:06,760
My Lady,

22
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,960
no wonder you had an affection for him!

23
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,550
I'm a pretty good judge of men.

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,630
My next man will also be good.

25
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,240
Miss Chi Hong, if you feel uncomfortable in your eyes

26
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:36,910
you can get a free examination from me.

27
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:39,630
What a thick-skulled man!

28
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,960
Actually, I specially came here to apologize

29
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,960
for what happened last time.

30
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,190
I was mistaken about you.

31
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,520
This is a critical period for brewing wine.

32
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,240
What a pity I couldn't enjoy it

33
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,190
you prepared.

34
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,080
I’m gotta go.

35
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,000
Okay, to be honest,

36
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:07,190
the smell of the wine

37
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,160
makes my mouth water.

38
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,390
Although I want someone to drink with me,

39
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,750
I have no relatives or friends on the island.

40
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:15,440
Rong is the only girl I know,

41
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,320
but she has become yours.

42
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,630
The only person I can think of is you.

43
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,910
If you are not willing to,

44
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:22,000
just forget it.

45
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:25,390
Alright.

46
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,270
I'll join you.

47
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,470
Cheers!

48
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:51,960
Duanmu Bai?

49
00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:53,440
Hello?

50
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,270
Though I'm afraid of enduring hardships,

51
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:00,720
in this sea area,

52
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,830
I'm a heavy drinker

53
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:03,880
without equal.

54
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:05,600
You totally lost today!

55
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:15,630
They are coming.

56
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,040
Rong,

57
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:22,320
for you,

58
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,600
I'll throw caution to the wind!

59
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,510
Anyway, after doing this,

60
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,440
I'll just kill him!

61
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,110
You bastard

62
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,830
don't deserve so good appearance.

63
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,270
So, "enjoying the cool air" means

64
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,390
bringing me here to feel the chilly wind?

65
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,390
This is the top

66
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,880
allowing a clear view of the Icy Building.

67
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,600
Please enjoy.

68
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,480
Fancy!

69
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,390
I didn't expect

70
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,480
to see it.

71
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,600
What a coincidence!

72
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:17,390
Bah!

73
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,040
How dare you!

74
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,510
I never take advantage of anyone.

75
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,510
You kissed me once,

76
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,880
I just gave you a return.

77
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,390
How fair it is!

78
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,510
When did I do that?

79
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,510
Last time, under the cliff,

80
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,270
you did it.

81
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,920
Are you drunk?

82
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,760
I...

83
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,760
I am drunk.

84
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,550
Is it serious?

85
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:09,830
Listen,

86
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:10,880
what is the relationship

87
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,950
between Qin Shangcheng and Rong?

88
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,320
Any lies

89
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,480
will cost your life!

90
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,200
I had no choice.

91
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,760
Excuse me!

92
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,480
Excuse me!

93
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,790
Are you thinking that Duanmu Bai was forced

94
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,200
to betray you?

95
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,670
You're sad now,

96
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,070
feeling your love in vain.

97
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,640
You are angry enough

98
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:35,950
to kill them, aren't you?

99
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,000
Shut up!

100
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,760
Duanmu Bai was kissing someone in the front of you.

101
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:43,600
But you should never feel jealous,

102
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,159
angry,

103
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:44,920
or disappointed,

104
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:46,270
so the so-called engagement

105
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,270
is merely a task to be finished.

106
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,070
You don't like him at all!

107
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,070
If you like someone,

108
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,670
you'll be happy when you see him,

109
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,110
be desperate when you lose him,

110
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:03,270
be willing to sacrifice everything to be with him.

111
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,640
Your heart beats

112
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,110
at the same rate.

113
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,200
Even if your heart is as cold as solid ice,

114
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,830
it must be melt in my love.

115
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,110
It will beat

116
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,880
as fast as mine.

117
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,920
Stop it!

118
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,110
Whatever you do

119
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,160
has nothing to do with me.

120
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:31,920
Like the hatching of the eagle egg,

121
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:33,390
no matter how much you've done,

122
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,920
you got nothing.

123
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,550
My Lord!

124
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,200
My Lord!

125
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,440
We got the baby eagle hatched.

126
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,760
Zhang Xian made it!

127
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:52,070
He is so lovely!

128
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,670
Let's give him a name.

129
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:57,510
Call it Daodao.

130
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:59,830
The infant name of our first kid

131
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,830
is Daodao.

132
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,640
It sounds so weird.

133
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,550
Why?

134
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:06,880
Nothing.

135
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:07,950
It just occurred to me.

136
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:12,040
Great.

137
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,600
You got a name,

138
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,230
Daodao.

139
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,160
They look like

140
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,480
Daodao's parents.

141
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,070
The baby eagle has been hatched.

142
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,040
And the Imperial Feather is around the corner.

143
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,040
When we enter the Imperial Island,

144
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,230
just stop pestering me.

145
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:35,789
Why not making a bet again?

146
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:37,400
Tomorrow afternoon from 3 to 5,

147
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,590
in the suburban forest,

148
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,110
let's meet again.

149
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:41,960
At that time,

150
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,840
if there is nothing of love between us,

151
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,960
the story will be over.

152
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:49,230
It's a deal.

153
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,640
It's time for you to wake up.

154
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,470
Shit!

155
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,790
How could I be drunk?

156
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,030
Pirate Chi Hong is indeed a heavy drinker.

157
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:24,150
Hope I didn't do anything indecent,

158
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,840
or the business would be delayed.

159
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,440
My Lady.

160
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,110
It's so unbelievable that

161
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:13,520
you look like an anthomaniac!

162
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,520
Is it that obvious?

163
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,400
When you liked Lord Qin,

164
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,470
you've never had such an expression.

165
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,710
So your last trick

166
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:02,880
is merely changing a suit

167
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,150
and a hairstyle.

168
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:07,710
You seem to be disappointed.

169
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,320
So, you were expecting something to happen

170
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:11,470
in the date.

171
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:15,200
All right.

172
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,110
Here comes an official introduction to me.

173
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:19,110
I'm Yunhe now,

Little White Dove.

176
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,910
Absolutely not.

177
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,470
Do you know what he is good at?

178
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:29,710
You mean...

179
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:30,110
Exactly.

180
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:31,590
You got it.

188
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,440
How do you feel in your first fly?

189
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,520
I've never been so relaxed!

190
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:02,710
Sometimes,

191
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:05,280
you can be trapped into some plights,

192
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,320
as if you are in a maze.

193
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:10,670
But when you stand at a higher place, you'll feel

194
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,470
that they are nothing

195
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:13,840
to speak of!

196
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,000
But it's impossible for us to stay in the sky forever.

197
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,640
We should eventually

198
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,200
go back to the ground.

199
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,710
Whether you're in the sky or on the ground,

200
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,710
you're meant to be unfettered.

201
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,710
Because you are a free little white dove.

202
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,590
Empty yourself!

203
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,280
Just live for the moment!

204
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:38,470
And enjoy it!

This is the Rapier.

210
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,320
What you should do is

211
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,230
to help Duanmu Bai

212
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,350
find it, right?

213
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,710
It is yours now.

214
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,550
You can take anything you want

from me.

216
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,910
But I will never force you to make a choice.

217
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,030
Up to now,

218
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,550
if you still have no feeling for me at all,

219
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:43,760
I'll keep my promise.

220
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:46,880

Meng.

229
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,790
Are you looking for Her Lady?

230
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:46,960
Right.

231
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:47,790
Is she here?

232
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,110
As a teammate,

233
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:50,670
I should have helped her brew wine these days.

234
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,350
Catching a cold last night,

235
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,840
Her Lady is in the room for a rest.

236
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:55,760
What?

237
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,030
How is she?

238
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,280
With some knowledge about medicine,

239
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,840
I can give her an examination,

240
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,880
and prescribe a decoction of medicinal herbs for her.

241
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,470
You don't have to, Your Highness.

242
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,080
Her Lady is going to recover.

243
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,110
You'd better go back early.

244
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:09,550
Fine.

245
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,030
Sorry to bother you.

246
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,000
Please deliver this to her.

247
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,590
No problem.

248
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:37,880
My Lady.

249
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,000
I know it.

250
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,030
For what?

251
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,880
The man who took your heart

252
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,910
must be Duanmu.

253
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,550
I... Why do you think so?

254
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:50,470
This morning,

255
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,550
you left the cloak with him.

256
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,590
And now, you deliberately hid yourself,

257
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:55,280
sniggering behind.

258
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,550
Weren't you playing cat and mouse game with him?

259
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,230
My Lady,

260
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,470
how clever you are!

261
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,150
Okay, you're right.

262
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:06,440
I kind of like him right now.

263
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,470
But I was not playing the game you said.

264
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,440
I did it for Rong.

265
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,910
Why?

266
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,400
Because of his family,

267
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,440
Duanmu Bai had no choice but to hurt her.

268
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,790
But it indeed damaged her relationship

269
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:19,880
with Qin Shangcheng.

270
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,880
So, as long as she can be reconciled to Qin,

271
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:25,280
I can be with Duanmu Bai fair and square.

272
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,150
Only in this way can I live up to her trust.

273
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,200
Now that you watched me dancing,

274
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,400
you should also give me something in return.

275
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,400
Your Highness.

276
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:01,200
White Dove.

277
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:02,840
Is something new

278
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,589
about the Rapier?

279
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:06,710
I need your confirmation.

280
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:08,710
For what?

281
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:11,470
Are you sure that it was Qin Shangcheng

282
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,520
that impaired our family?

283
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:16,230
Definitely.

284
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:17,160
Any evidence?

285
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:21,880
Here I am.

286
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:27,430
Have you got the Rapier?

287
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:33,920
As I promised,

288
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,880
I will take the Rapier

289
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,190
after helping you become the alliance leader.

290
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:38,830
Are you sure?

291
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,160
My word is my bond.

292
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,190
I hope you can also keep your promise.

293
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,190
You haven't answered my question yet.

294
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,800
Do I need it?

295
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,280
Fine.

296
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,190
But I've already known the answer.

297
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,680
Her Highness is really a follower of the code of Jianghu.

298
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:00,110
She surprisingly returned the Rapier.

299
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,800
His Lord must have used the damn Rapier

300
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,070
to get Her Highness's heart.

301
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:04,830
Am I right, My Lord?

302
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,520
Rong was instilled with false memories

303
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,800
by being mesmerized,

304
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,760
so she can't accept her real identity.

305
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,000
But right now,

306
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,590
my relationship with her is getting better,

307
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,000
and she refused to become the wife of Duanmu.

308
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,040
I believe that

309
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,400
she should have a new recognition

310
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:20,760
of her own.

311
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:22,000
So,

312
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:24,230
the efforts His Lord made paid off!

313
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,430
But when will she believe

314
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:28,680
that she's meant to be your wife?

315
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,000
Up till now,

316
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,430
all I need to do is to keep going,

317
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,310
and have a closer relation with Rong.

318
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,710
She'll understand everything sooner or later.

319
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:38,710
Daodao.

320
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,110
Look, Daodao loves me.

321
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,430
Just like my love for you.

322
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,800
He's just hungry.

323
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:50,800
My love,

324
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,710
look, what did I bring for you?

325
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,400
Here is a deal, my son.

326
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,000
The food is in exchange for your help.

327
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,000
We should

328
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,400
please your mother.

329
00:18:59,070 --> 00:18:59,430
Over here.

330
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,070
Why do you feed him this?

331
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,070
How should I?

332
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,160
Milk.

333
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:11,520
My Lord.

334
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,560
This is high quality sheep's milk,

335
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,310
with abundant nutrition,

336
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:15,230
which is a must for the baby eagle's growth!

337
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:16,710
Bah!

338
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:22,160
You're a real troublemaker!

339
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,590
Can you image that my delicate hands

340
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:25,280
that are born to touch jade ware,

341
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,110
are clearing the bird droppings?

342
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,400
What's up?

343
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:29,430
Aren't you willing to do it?

344
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:30,760
Of course not!

345
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,680
I love it.

346
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:32,560
Hold on!

347
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:33,760
Leave it with me.

348
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:35,560
My Lord!

349
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,000
Father's love is as great as a mountain.

350
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,640
The back of a father

351
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,040
is so big and tall!

352
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:14,920
Little White Dove?

353
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,040
Go to your bedroom if you're sleepy.

354
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:22,400
I'm okay.

355
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,680
What if he is hungry at night?

356
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:26,710
Our son

357
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,230
will be an imperial eagle flying in the sky.

358
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,430
He can learn to take care of himself.

359
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:32,950
Besides,

360
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,040
I'm here.

361
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:39,470
Remember to call me when time is up.

362
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:40,470
Okay.

363
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:42,350
I'll leave the dinner

364
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,800
on the table near you.

365
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,640
Just help yourself.

366
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:40,270
[One Month Later]

367
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:01,950
Look!

368
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,680
Daodao is flying.

369
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,310
Daodao!

370
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,560
As a father, did you pluck it to help him grow?

371
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,310
No, I didn't!

372
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,640
It dropped down when Daodao

373
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,590
was learning to fly.

374
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:52,430
He managed the flying skill

375
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:53,430
no more than half a day.

376
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:56,000
It lives up to the expectation of his parents,

377
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:58,110
Yunhe and White Dove!

378
00:22:58,950 --> 00:22:59,880
None of your nonsense!

379
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,040
Daodao is the son of Imperial Eagle.

380
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:04,830
Now that he can fly,

381
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,950
he should go back to his own parents.

382
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,830
Great minds think alike!

383
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:10,880
Daodao,

384
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:11,880
follow the words of your "mother".

385
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,160
You'll be sent home from 7 to 9 tomorrow morning.

386
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,280
One day,

387
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:24,070
we'll have our own children.

388
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,160
What a libertine!

389
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:50,590
Your Highness,

390
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:52,070
what happened?

391
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,040
White Dove,

392
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,920
do you really believe Qin Shangcheng likes you?

393
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:01,640
You misunderstood me.

394
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:04,880
Do you know why

395
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,800
I picked you up for the task?

396
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:08,760
Because your appearance

397
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,400
and Qin Shangcheng's dead wife,

398
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,310
Hua Rong,

399
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:13,830
look alike.

400
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:16,920
You're nothing but his wife's substitute.

401
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,280
If you don't believe what I said,

402
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,070
you can go to him dressing like Hua Rong,

403
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:23,710
and you'll know

404
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,710
if I'm right or not.

405
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,310
You're great enough

406
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,040
to fly.

407
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,470
Just fly

408
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,560
to find your real parents.

409
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,070
Just fly.

410
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,350
Fly away.

411
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,040
Qin Shangcheng！

412
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:33,000
Rong.

413
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,830
You finally come back.

414
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:38,920
Finally.

415
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:39,680
Rong.

416
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:48,430
So the one you've been looking forward to

417
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,160
is Hua Rong, is it?

418
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,400
Calm down.

419
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,520
Shut up!

420
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:56,560
Your eyes told me

421
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,950
who you wanna see is Hua Rong.

422
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,520
You've never really liked me!

423
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:02,920
During this time,

424
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,470
whatever you said,

425
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,000
or you did,

426
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:07,350
was totally for Hua Rong!

427
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:10,040
I was just a substitute for her,

428
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,400
for your delivery of thoughts for your dead wife!

429
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,560
Listen to me.

430
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,800
Darn it!

431
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:17,950
Fine.

432
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,680
From now on,

433
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,830
there's nothing left

434
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,190
between us

435
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,680
expect for the Rapier.

436
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,310
Rong!

437
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:26,830
Piss off!

438
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:27,470
Rong, please.

439
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:28,280
Let me go!

440
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,520
Just a moment.

441
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,710
You are not a substitute.

442
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:36,160
Everything I told you

443
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,590
was from the bottom of my heart.

444
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,160
You are Hua Rong!

445
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,000
How long are you going to trick me?

446
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:44,040
Trust me,

447
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,710
Hua Rong is White Dove.

448
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:46,880
and vice versa.

449
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,640
You are actually my wife!

450
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:51,000
It was my fault no protecting you well,

451
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,640
making an open door to Duanmu Bai.

452
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:54,350
He instilled fake memories

453
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:55,400
into your mind.

454
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,000
You were forced

455
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,230
to accept them.

456
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:05,800
Stop lying to me.

457
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:12,880
One day,

458
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:16,560
you'll know everything I said is true.

459
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:18,710
I'm waiting for

460
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:20,230
that day.

461
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,920
I will neither force you,

462
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:25,000
nor change myself.

463
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,640
Whoever

464
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:29,400
you are,

465
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,070
as long as the bell rings,

466
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:36,160
I'll be there for you.

467
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:54,190
Go flying.

468
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,230
I'm fine.

469
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,400
Daodao has gone.

470
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,800
But the memory among us

471
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,310
lasts forever.

472
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:27,830
My Lady,

473
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,040
as far as I know,

474
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,880
for brewing the Golden Wine,

475
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,160
only two teams of you and Duanmu Bai,

476
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,520
and Lord Qin and Hua Rong succeeded.

477
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,880
The others didn't even see the Imperial Eagle.

478
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:37,710
You're right.

479
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,400
But I'm just wondering,

480
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,070
if Duanmu Bai goes to the Imperial Alliance

481
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:42,950
where Qin Shangcheng and Hua Rong are,

482
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:45,070
what should I do?

483
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,160
That is the question.

484
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,830
I heard that their relationship just started to thaw,

485
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,400
but there was a new rift.

486
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:54,710
Sorry My Lady,

487
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:56,230
how hard it is for you to pursue love!

488
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:57,880
If you have nothing to do,

489
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,950
provide me with more ideas.

490
00:28:58,950 --> 00:28:59,950
Your salary is gonna be confiscated next month!

491
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:01,000
Oh no!

492
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,920
I have something to show you.

493
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:03,680
Here it is!

494
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,920
This is a personal weapon of Miss Hua.

495
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:07,070
I was too busy

496
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:08,310
to give it back to her.

497
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:10,470
Good job.

498
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,760
It can be an excuse

499
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,830
for a communication with Rong.

500
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:15,920
So, being alone with Duanmu Bai

501
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,000
can be avoided.

502
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:18,800
Rong,

503
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:19,710
it's back.

504
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:22,950
Next exam is said to be very dangerous.

505
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:24,190
You should protect yourself.

506
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,000
Thanks a lot.

507
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:28,710
And

508
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,470
how are you doing with Qin Shangcheng?

509
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,310
Trust me,

510
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:36,680
you are Hua Rong,

511
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:38,680
the wife of Qin Shangcheng.

512
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,190
You just cannot accept the fact for now.

513
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:48,230
How a rude woman she is!

514
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:50,950
So Her Highness's boomerang

515
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,430
had been with Chi Hong.

516
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:55,310
She seems to be a keeper

517
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,520
of the code of Jianghu.

518
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:59,070
After all she returned the boomerang to Her Highness.

519
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:01,590
She has also lent me a hand.

520
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:05,520
My Lady, she...

521
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:06,400
Thanks.

522
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,190
Miss Chi,

523
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,350
His Highness is coming.

524
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:10,190
It's your time.

525
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:16,160
Duanmu Bai!

526
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:17,880
I'm just standing here,

527
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,400
but you completely ignored me!

528
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,350
How could you?

529
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,310
The first exam was over,

530
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:25,280
so is our partnership.

531
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:26,680
You are my opponent now.

532
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,350
Congratulations! You are qualified

533
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:40,350
to enter the Imperial Island for another exam.

534
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,280
The second one

535
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,800
is the Way to the Alliance Leader.

536
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,470
The location

537
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:46,920
is the Orchid Valley,

538
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,760
which is in the Island.

539
00:30:57,110 --> 00:31:00,430
[The Orchid Valley is full of mystery.]

540
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:03,760
[The Island has diverse toxic flowers and insects,]

541
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:05,560
[and rarities and wild animals.]

542
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:07,190
[It is an extremely dangerous place.]

543
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,560
[After landing on the island,]

544
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:13,160
[you will be distributed to different areas.]

545
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:14,760
[Three days after,]

546
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,880
[the one who can reach the Imperial Palace,]

547
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,710
[seceding from the Valley,]

548
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,880
[will pass this exam]

549
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,710
[and get to the final exam for the Alliance Leader!]

550
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:06,800
Are you okay?

551
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,230
Such a pretty view can't be appreciated by people.

552
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,280
What a pity!

553
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:38,160
As relations between White Dove and Qin Shangcheng

554
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:40,070
is starting to thaw,

555
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:42,800
do you

556
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,520
still intend to ask her

557
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,350
to get the Rapier back?

558
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,070
Master, you mean,

559
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
it's your turn?

560
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,000
Exactly.

561
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:56,070
The next exam will be held in the Imperial Island.

562
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:58,640
What you should do is to pass the test.

563
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,400
Just leave with me

564
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,680
the task to fight against Qin Shangcheng,

565
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,760
and get the Rapier back.

566
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,400
What stratagems would my master set?

567
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,040
[Your Highness, I believe]

568
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,520
[that you won't commit a double blunder]

569
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,710
[of delaying the business]

570
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:37,680
[because of personal love.]

571
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,590
Get away!

572
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:55,760
Piss off!

573
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,710
Haven't you told me you were my opponent?

574
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:18,560
Why did you save me?

575
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,800
I just don't want you to agitate the swarm,

576
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,080
or I'll be also affected.

577
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:26,949
Are you playing cat and mouse game with me?

578
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,280
I am not nobody's fool!

579
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:34,710
Alas!

580
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,800
What if

581
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,710
he really parts with me?

582
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:40,190
Before Rong's decision,

583
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:40,949
I would be sneaking a tail

584
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,320
behind him.

585
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,429
How did you find me?

586
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:08,950
The compass

587
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:12,040
is connected to your boomerang.

588
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:33,520
Take it easy.

589
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,000
For the boomerang,

590
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,950
I didn't ask Chi Hong to give it to you.

591
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,280
It's yours.

592
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,670
And I promised,

593
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:43,910
as long as your bell rings,

594
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,630
I'll be there.

595
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:52,630
Anyhow,

596
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,320
thanks for saving me.

597
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,320
You regarded me as an outsider.

598
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:00,430
Before the end of the exam,

599
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,320
we are allies.

600
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:04,280
We promised that, isn't it?

601
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:06,080
We should join hands together.

602
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,800
As you all said, I am Hua Rong,

603
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,520
but I just cannot recall anything.

604
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:24,950
It doesn't matter.

605
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:27,840
Take your time.

606
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,280
I'm waiting for you.

607
00:36:57,950 --> 00:36:59,230
The mist is so strange.

608
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,080
Rong!

609
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:11,600
Rong!

610
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,710
Good job.

611
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,080
You task is finished.

612
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,600
Wearing a mask for so long,

613
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,800
you'll find it harder to take it off.

614
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,080
Don't you really have a feeling for him?

615
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,040
All right,

616
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,910
it's understandable that you love him.

617
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,670
Because you are actually Hua Rong,

618
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:36,320
his wife.

619
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:39,470
[You're nobody's substitute,]

620
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:41,080
[because you are Hua Rong!]

621

[Hua Rong is White Dove,]

622

[You are actually my wife!]

624

[All your memories now]

00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,600
[are fake.]

626
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,320
[You were forced]

627
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,560
[to accept them.]

628
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:52,430
[One day,]

I forget you,

I love you

686

forever.

687
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:17,950
I'll always be by your side,

688
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,870

00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:10,950
Zhang Xian.

698
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:12,760
Are you practicing calligraphy?

699
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,390
I'm not.

700
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,950
I'm writing to Hui.

701
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,870
Before departure, I promised

702
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:18,670
to write her

703
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:20,190
every day.

704
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,600
Let me have a look.

705
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,230
Hun...

706
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:29,320
Oh no, Hui.

707
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,870
Recently,

708
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:33,520
we are in an Imperial Alli...

709
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,280
Meeting?

710
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,670
Well...

711
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:38,150
The suffix of "ance" was lost.

712
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:41,950
I ate a lot these days.

713
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:43,630
And I had a good sleep every day.

714
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,150
But in the Imperial Allia...

715
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:48,710
the Imperial Alliance, the food is plain.

716
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:52,320
I have not eaten meat for days.

717
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:55,870
Zhang Xian,

718
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:57,390
is it a running account record?

719
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,910
What's your point?

720
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:00,950
I miss her.

721
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:02,280
Just write it down.

722
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:04,800
Qian Dayou.

723
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:06,560
How about

724
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,360
you write it for me?

725
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:08,360
None of my business.

726
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:12,320
The glaze cup His Lord gave me

727
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:12,910
is yours now!

728
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:13,360
It's a deal.

729
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:13,950
Well,

730
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:15,470
I'm gonna speak it,

731
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:16,120
and you write it down.

732
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:19,520
Hurry up.

733
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,870
To my beloved wife,

734
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:25,520
Hui,

735
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,910
since I met you,

736
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:31,470
we've been in deep love,

737
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:32,910
leading us to get married.

738
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,360
Till now,

739
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,000
two years have passed.

740
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,080
We've been in deep love,

741
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,280
leading us to get married.

742
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:41,230
So romantic!

743
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:42,320
Come on!

744
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:47,320
[Fool as I am,]

745
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,870
[I never forget your love for me.]

746
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:50,430
[Despite my low class,]

747
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:52,150
[you're willing to be my wife,]

748
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,390
[and take care of me and our family.]

749
00:42:54,910 --> 00:42:55,950
[I love you so much.]

750
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:58,470
[May my love for you bless]

751
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:00,150
[our unborn baby]

752
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,190
[and you]

753
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,430
[healthy and happy.]

754
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:04,430
[I wish to be with you]

755
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:05,760
[forever,]

756
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,150
[till death do us part.]

757
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:11,670
Hui,

758
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:13,230
I've never seen you so moved

759
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:14,840
by a letter. Why?

760
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,320
There's something you don't know.

761
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:19,230
For several months, this is the first one

762
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:21,000
that I understand.

763
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:23,760
I forgot to tell Zhang Xian more about the letter,

764
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,950
so I read his day-to-day accounts for months!

765
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:28,470
Finally, he

766
00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:30,360
knows Qian Dayou is helpful in this regard.

767
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,150
I'm absolutely overwhelmed!
