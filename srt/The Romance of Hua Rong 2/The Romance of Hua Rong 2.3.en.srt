3
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,440
Oh, it's you.

4
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:58,800
Haven't seen you for a few days,

5
00:01:59,160 --> 00:01:59,800
My Lord

6
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,270
becomes more dashing.

7
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,270
Such perfunctory compliment is worthless.

8
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,110
But the goods

9
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,389
and the spies you sent

10
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,270
were very useful to me.

11
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,520
Don't celebrate too early.

12
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:14,720
Soon

13
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,079
we South Desolation will make a comeback.

14
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,360
By then,

15
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,960
you'll know what we can do.

16
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,000
How's it?

17
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,390
Otherwise,

18
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,910
ask me for mercy in advance.

19
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,750
Are you going to get reinforcements?

20
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:36,110
That's it?

21
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,240
The information about South Desolation

22
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,079
in these letters

23
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:42,390
is only one or two out of ten.

24
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,270
Even if you take them,

25
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,720
they're of limited use.

26
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:49,800
Indeed.

27
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,390
Looks like I have to

28
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:53,880
catch the guy behind you.

29
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:57,670
What?

30
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,600
Am I right?

31
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,910
So what?

32
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,270
You can never find him.

33
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,800
And I will never divulge a word to you.

34
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,470
You didn't get a single beating.

35
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,600
Of course you don't know what to do.

36
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,670
I will send someone to escort you to the
government later.

37
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,390
After you have tasted

38
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:19,910
their methods one by one,

39
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:22,800
maybe

40
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,750
you will change your mind at that time.

41
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,440
You...

42
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:30,390
My Lord,

43
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,270
wouldn't it be inappropriate

44
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:33,720
if you don't escort her there?

45
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,960
What kind of waves

46
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,800
can a woman make?

47
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:38,800
Moreover,

48
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,670
I have invited Rong to go to the painting workshop.

49
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:41,720
Let's go.

50
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,670
Reveal a flaw later.

51
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,270
There is someone else behind that woman.

52
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,720
She will not give up.

53
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:57,670
OK.

54
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:58,829
My Lord

55
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,110
You and her highness...

56
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,830
To catch a big fish,

57
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:04,080
you shall cast a long line.

58
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,030
OK.

59
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,550
How's it, Zhu?

60
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:22,880
Are these things great?

61
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,550
You are the best.

62
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,830
Tonight

63
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,000
you will definitely make it.

64
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:05,950
All ready?

65
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,160
Of course, My Lord.

66
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:15,880
What will Qin do?

67
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,790
Is he going to Rong?

68
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,510
Don't meddle in the affairs

69
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,390
of the young couple.

70
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,040
Go back to sleep.

71
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,760
Rong treats me like her sister.

72
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,390
You lie to her,

73
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,550
but I can't cheat her.

74
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,480
No, don't go.

75
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,110
I'm here.

76
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,070
I'll tell you a truth.

77
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,640
Rong likes Qin.

78
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,000
Let them clear up the misunderstanding.

79
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Why not?

80
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,270
Yeah.

81
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,670
You get the point.

82
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,230
I know all the truth,

83
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,000
but if you want me to keep it a secret,

84
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,230
there must be some benefits.

85
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:45,320
Benefits...

86
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:47,760
Anyway, I have no money.

87
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,640
If you want my life...

88
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,760
Who wants your life?

89
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,760
Close your eyes.

90
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,670
Fine.

91
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,040
Will I be afraid of you little girl?

92
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,270
I hugged you.

93
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:05,600
Crazy girl.

94
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,790
Why are these all my favorites?

95
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,480
What's going on?

96
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,920
He should be

97
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,390
my target tonight.

98
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,350
May I ask

99
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,160
why am I invited here tonight?

100
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,670
Try them.

101
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,320
Are these all for me?

102
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,920
I didn't expect that

103
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,000
all these South Desolation spies

104
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,510
are romantic veterans.

105
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:24,480
Fine.

106
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:26,640
You will never return today.

107
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,160
I can't repay you

108
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,110
for your gifts.

109
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:31,040
I can only dance for you

110
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,040
and show you

111
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,110
my aptitudes,

112
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:33,880
how's it?

113
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:36,600
Fine.

114
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,510
How's the dance,

115
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,760
my lord?

116
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:27,790
Not bad.

117
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,200
I knew you are shameless,

118
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,789
but I didn't expect you to be so arrogant

119
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:35,590
and dare to touch me.

120
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,960
Today I'll show you

121
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,110
the power of Swordwoman Huahua.

122
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,150
Lecher.

123
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:39,840
Go to hell.

124
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,470
Qin Shangcheng

125
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:43,230
It's me.

126
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,550
This is the whole thing.

127
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,470
I know

128
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,000
you want to flex your muscles

129
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,760
and catch the spy.

130
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,790
I wanted to take the opportunity to surprise you.

131
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,760
So you colluded with Mr. Wei

132
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,350
to cooperate with me in this play

133
00:08:59,350 --> 00:08:59,910
and let me dance there

134
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,590
in circles for so long.

135
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,110
No, Rong, I...

136
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,080
Qin Shangcheng

137
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,080
I thought you should understand me

138
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,280
after we've been through so much,

139
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,960
but why can't you understand?

140
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,550
Listen to me.

141
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:15,030
At first,

142
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,910
I found that the spies of the South Desolation

143
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:17,840
are insidious,

144
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:18,840
so I wanted to protect you

145
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,080
subconsciously.

146
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:22,760
But later,

147
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:23,760
I found that

148
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:25,440
what you really want

149
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,550
is not protection,

150
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,880
but to fight together with me.

151
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,640
So I invited you here today,

152
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,080
just to make it clear.

153
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,030
I wish the name of

154
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,030
Swordwoman Huahua

155
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,110
be spread all over the world.

156
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:38,590
and I always be with you,

157
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,790
travel around Jianghu,

158
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:41,000
forget hatred, and live happily.

159
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,670
So you gave me those.

160
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,030
Actually,

161
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:47,910
the gifts I want to give you

162
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:48,960
are not these things.

163
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,200
What's that then?

164
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:53,960
Coming.

165
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,150
It's almost

166
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,280
the right time.

167
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,640
You are still in the mood to date

168
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,110
when you are going to die.

169
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:12,470
Sorry.

170
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,000
You didn't expect me to escape, did you?

171
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,910
You brought so many people here,

172
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:21,350
presumably,

173
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,790
this is the boss behind you.

174
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,030
Today you are going to bet all your wealth

175
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,880
to kill me.

176
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:30,670
Such a pleasure.

177
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,640
For so many years,

178
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,910
the only person who forces me to do it myself

179
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,350
is you, Lord Qin.

180
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,670
It's a pity that

181
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,840
today we meet for the first time

182
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:39,350
and also the last time.

183
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:40,910
Indeed the last time.

184
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,760
However, it's not us

185
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,760
who are going to die.

186
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,080
What do you mean?

187
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,030
Brothers,

188
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,280
show up.

189
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,000
My Lord

190
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:57,960
My Lord

191
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:00,110
You two have played too long.

192
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,470
We can't wait.

193
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,200
Qian Dayou.

194
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,710
Our people said that

195
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,150
they were dating.

196
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,350
I didn't expect...

197
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,520
I find it more interesting

198
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,440
to catch you gang of South Desolation spies

199
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,030
than dating.

200
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:16,440
Lord Qin,

201
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,110
you are a good schemer.

202
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:20,350
You two,

203
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:21,910
surrender.

204
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,080
Don't resist,

205
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,280
or your brothers will all be killed.

206
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,470
You have no way to escape.

207
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:35,790
This time, we destroyed

208
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,670
the whole South Desolation stronghold in Mingzhou.

209
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,030
We have lived up to Mr. Wei.

210
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:40,960
The most important thing is that

211
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,280
we helped General Hua solve the problem of rear
defense.

212
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:45,110
In this way, the South Desolation

213
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,110
will retreat sooner or later.

214
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,640
By the way, Rong,

215
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:49,280
I have something for you.

216
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:50,470
What?

217
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,350
Here is

218
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,080
the distribution map of Tianchu granaries

219
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,110
and the document files of South Desolation spies.

220
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,400
From now on, we will

221
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,760
face everything

222
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,590
together.

223
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:05,760
OK.

224
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,150
I wonder if Swordwoman Huahua

225
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,200
will accept it.

226
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,710
Yes.

227
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,320
Since you are so sincere,

228
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,470
I will definitely help you.

229
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,790
These South Desolation spies are so hateful.

230
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,030
In the future, I will set up

231
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:19,840
a fairy spy group

232
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:20,790
to prevent them

233
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,280
from making a comeback.

234
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,400
And the Tianchu army

235
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,760
will have no worries anymore.

236
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:29,880
Why are you looking at me like that?

237
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:32,640
I am thinking

238
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,000
whose wife is so talented,

239
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,710
so beautiful, and so valiant.

240
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,200
So pretty.

241
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,400
Loquacious.

242
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,470
I am serious.

243
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:42,840
Rong

244
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:44,320
Don't worry about

245
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:45,470
the wedding.

246
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:46,760
I've made up my mind.

247
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,200
I'd like to wait.

248
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,350
Wait until the day

249
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,550
you are willing to marry me.

250
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:55,230
What?

251
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,320
Qin Shangcheng,

252
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,520
do you know

253
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,280
what was on my mind

254
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,910
when you and I meet the enemy just now?

255
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,030
What?

256
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:06,590
I was thinking that

257
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,030
if something

258
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,030
happened

259
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,470
to one of us,

260
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,110
then the biggest regret of my life would be that

261
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:13,760
I have no time to marry you.

262
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:14,550
So

263
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,080
I want to be your wife right now.

264
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,400
I don't want to wait any longer.

265
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:22,470
But General Hua is still at the border.

266
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,350
Then I'll write to my father first.

267
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:25,880
He has long regarded you as half a foster son.

268
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,150
How would he object?

269
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:36,640
Have you really made up your mind,

270
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,110
Rong?

271
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,790
Qin Shangcheng

272
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:39,960
I've taken the initiative.

273
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,440
Why are you so garrulous?

274
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,710
If you don't want to get married,

275
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:43,840
just ignore my word.

276
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:45,590
Who said I don't want to.

277
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:48,000
It's a lifetime matter.

278
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,840
Don't go back on your word.

279
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,550
There's someone, Qin Shangcheng.

280
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,030
I'm kissing my wife.

281
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:57,320
Let him watch.

282
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,910
My Lord and her highness reconciled.

283
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:01,640
Let's go.

284
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,110
Let me watch for a while.

285
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:02,640
Just a while.

286
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:26,000
Hurry up, come on.

287
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,880
Hurry up, hurry up.

288
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:27,880
Come on.

289
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:28,880
Be careful.

290
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,550
Be careful.

291
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:33,350
My Lord

292
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:34,760
My Lord

293
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,080
How's it going?

294
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:37,230
All here.

295
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:38,000
Just waiting for you and her highness.

296
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,000
Where's her highness?

297
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,960
Saying goodbye to Zhu.

298
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,350
Zhang Xian,

299
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:43,840
let's go.

300
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,200
OK.

301
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,000
Go, go, go.

302
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,880
Come on.

303
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:51,000
Zhu,

304
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,670
you really decided?

305
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:55,080
Your spy team is in need of manpower

306
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,230
in Mingzhou.

307
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,910
I am the most suitable person to stay.

308
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:00,320
That's fine.

309
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:02,470
Then you stay to toughen yourself.

310
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:03,550
When you learn your skills,

311
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:04,960
go to Huarong Island to find me immediately.

312
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,080
Rong

313
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:10,790
I hate to leave you.

314
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:12,590
Me, too.

315
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,400
But,

316
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,520
I'm not the one

317
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,520
you want most.

318
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,470
It's your Dayou.

319
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,350
OK.

320
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,440
You two have a good chat.

321
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,880
I'll help you get Qian Dayou here.

322
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,440
Wait.

323
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,880
Dayou

324
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,280
What?

325
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:36,030
You've become a member of the spy team.

326
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:36,960
Be happy.

327
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,470
You are right.

328
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,110
I have to work hard

329
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:42,790
to be a qualified spy.

330
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,550
Dayou

331
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,080
Promise me you will rest well,

332
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,280
sleep well,

333
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:53,640
and make more money.

334
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,840
Wait for me.

335
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,550
Fine,

336
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:58,440
don't worry about me.

337
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,200
Take care of yourself.

338
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:03,000
Will you miss me

339
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,670
when you go back on the island?

340
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:05,590
What are you thinking about?

341
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,470
After I return to the island,

342
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:07,760
I have to run errands for My Lord everyday

343
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,470
and be busy making money.

344
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:09,320
How can I have time to miss you?

345
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,910
That's right.

346
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:12,790
Dayou is busy.

347
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,320
Oh,

348
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,400
my mother gave me

349
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,880
this piggy bank.

350
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,550
I want to give it to you.

351
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,030
You will think of me

352
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,080
when you save money.

353
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,000
Someday,

354
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,520
when this it is full,

355
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,030
I will be back to you.

356
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,030
Fine.

357
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,080
Thank you.

358
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:50,670
Qian

359
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:51,880
In my opinion,

360
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,760
Zhu

361
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,710
is actually quite good.

362
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,880
How many times have I told you?

363
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,880
What I want is love at first sight.

364
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,590
No matter how good Zhu is,

365
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,110
it's useless if I don't like her.

366
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:02,960
Listen to me.

367
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:04,710
There are

368
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:05,680
many kinds of love.

369
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,829
You see, I didn't fall in love

370
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,640
with Hui at first sight, right?

371
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,560
But

372
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,400
we have children now.

373
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:11,950
Go away.

374
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:12,880
Don't show off here.

375
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:30,880
We've all been away for so long.

376
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,160
I really miss Huarong island.

377
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,280
What do you think the people on the island are
doing?

378
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,470
Of course they are busy

379
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:38,070
preparing for our wedding.

380
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:38,710
I told them

381
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,520
to prepare

382
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,920
the grandest

383
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,350
and the most special wedding for you.

384
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,000
Qin Shangcheng

385
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:47,520
They have prepared twice.

386
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,000
Will it be nothing new for them?

387
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:50,710
How can they be?

388
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:51,800
In my eyes,

389
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,520
Rong is as beautiful as the first sight.

390
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,430
I'm not talking about this.

391
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:57,230
No matter what,

392
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:58,110
Rong is the most beautiful.

393
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,830
Shooting star!

394
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,040
Where's it?

395
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,520
Qin Shangcheng

396
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,920
Why kiss me slinkingly every time?

397
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,920
You're not serious at all.

398
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,190
But you didn't let me when I'm serious.

399
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,110
You...

400
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,040
Go away.

401
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:10,040
Rong

402
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,040
Go away.

403
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,070
This way.

404
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,160
Put it neatly.

405
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,590
Put this box over there.

406
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,400
OK.

407
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,160
Easy, easy.

408
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,430
There can be no mistake

409
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:54,760
at the wedding of My Lord and her highness.

410
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:55,950
Get it?

411
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,230
Be careful.

412
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,760
Easy.

413
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,350
My Lord

414
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,280
Not bad.

415
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,400
Oh, My Lord.

416
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,830
Five hundred red candles,

417
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:06,710
one hundred lanterns,

418
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:07,920
two carriages full of fireworks ordered from Wanjiang,

419
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,920
and the best wedding dress

420
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,950
ordered from Tianchu

421
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,280
are all ready.

422
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:13,920
My Lord,

423
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,400
this time

424
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,710
you pour money into the wedding.

425
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:17,520
It must be

426
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,430
more wonderful and grand than the first one.

427
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,800
Just kidding.

428
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,920
I mean

429
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,680
the second marriage between you and her highness

430
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,160
is not a second marriage in the general sense.

431
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:27,230
It's bigamous marriage.

432
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:28,520
No.

433
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,560
It's dual marriage.

434
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:30,920
Dual sweetness

435
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,830
and dual happiness.

436
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,280
Qian Dayou,

437
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,430
in terms of flattery,

438
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:38,110
you are the first in the world.

439
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:38,880
Just so so.

440
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:53,160
My Lord

441
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,190
Not bad, Zhang Xian.

442
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:55,640
You have a talent for music.

443
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,710
I'm just pretending to conduct.

444
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:58,590
It's mainly because the band

445
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:00,400
that My Lord hired from the capital is great.

446
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,190
Of course.

447
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,520
Where's Rong?

448
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:07,350
Her highness was energetic

449
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,070
and went up to the mountain behind

450
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:09,310
to train troops in the morning.

451
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,110
Rong has been working hard

452
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,640
in training the women soldiers these days.

453
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,000
Treat her well

454
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,400
for lunch today.

455
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,400
OK.

456
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,160
Four.

457
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:21,920
Five.

458
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,520
There are countless heroines.

459
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,800
Who said that women are inferior to men?

460
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:29,000
Go on.

461
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:29,920
One.

462
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,160
Rong

463
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,230
Slow down.

464
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,760
Freshly released Jianghu Daily.

465
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,590
Jianghu Daily.

466
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:35,160
How's it?

467
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,230
Is this month's

468
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:37,160
heroines ranking list out?

469
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:37,680
Yeah.

470
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,710
Hold on.

471
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:40,560
Guess

472
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,190
where Rong is ranked?

473
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:43,710
No.1, definitely No.1.

474
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:44,920
Easy, easy.

475
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,520
I'll distribute them.

476
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:46,350
Here.

477
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:47,520
Give me.

478
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,310
Me, too.

479
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:48,830
Hold on.

480
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:49,110
You all have a share.

481
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:51,470
General's daughter wiped out spies' dens,

482
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:53,710
ensured the safety of Tianchu and won the first
place.

483
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,760
General Hua won the first place.

484
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,310
What did I say?

485
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:00,070
She could surely make it.

486
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,040
Brilliant.

487
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:01,800
No.1.

488
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:04,880
Great!

489
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:05,920
Look.

490
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,190
Look at this ranking.

491
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:12,230
Her highness

492
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,000
Her highness

493
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:17,710
This is the lunch cooked by My Lord himself.

494
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,680
It smells good.

495
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,430
Zhang Xian

496
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,160
You're getting unruly now.

497
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,430
You have to let My Lord and her highness

498
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:27,310
wait for you for lunch, don't you?

499
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:28,950
Sorry, My Lord.

500
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:29,880
I just went to make

501
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,000
soup for Hui.

502
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:32,190
Then I directly come here.

503
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,280
Sorry, her highness.

504
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,350
What are you showing off?

505
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,070
Let me tell you.

506
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,920
My Lord will definitely catch up

507
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,640
and give birth to many little pirates.

508
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,710
Her highness, am I right?

509
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:41,880
I'm hungry.

510
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,000
Her highness, wait a minute.

511
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,230
These dishes prepared by My Lord

512
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:45,230
are not simple.

513
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,560
You have to understand its meaning

514
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,640
before you can taste it.

515
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:48,520
Wait.

516
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,070
Wouldn't it be something like Love for All Seasons

517
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:52,680
and A Perfect Match?

518
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:55,470
This time the meaning is better than that.

519
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,070
Well.

520
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,520
What about this lotus-nuts sweet soup with osmanthus?

521
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,830
Have a sweet baby early.

522
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:01,640
Then

523
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,160
what about these double-yolked eggs?

524
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,680
Have two babies.

525
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:05,560
Then

526
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:07,070
so many chicken claws

527
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:08,230
next to this hen,

528
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:09,520
wouldn't it be full of children and grandchildren?

529
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,000
Her highness are really smart.

530
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,920
But the name given by My Lord

531
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,880
is more chic.

532
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,470
It's called Phoenix Nurtures Nine Children.

533
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:14,920
Applaud.

534
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,040
I,

535
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:17,920
I have something else to do.

536
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,760
You guys eat first.

537
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:19,880
Rong

538
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:25,590
My Lord

539
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,710
Did I say anything wrong?

540
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:41,520
Her highness achieved her goal and

541
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,040
topped the list of heroines.

542
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,070
Why is she not happy?

543
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:45,110
Is it

544
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,520
because she doesn't want to have children?

545
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:48,350
Are you blind?

546
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,280
My Lord has found the reason.

547
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:50,830
Take a look.

548
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,880
Who Swordman Yunhe loves is unknown.

549
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:01,560
After the three-year agreement, Chi Hong wants
to cut in.

550
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:03,560
Isn't this Chi Hong

551
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:04,950
the female pirate who lost to My Lord

552
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,520
in the fight three years ago?

553
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,110
That's the dominatrix.

554
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,830
Back then, in the battle of Taohua Island,

555
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:11,310
Chi Hong's mask was shattered by My Lord,

556
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,160
and then she held the grudge.

557
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,190
She said My Lord is the first man

558
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:14,110
who saw her face,

559
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:15,800
and unilaterally announced the three-year
agreement.

560
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,640
If My Lord loses, he must marry her.

561
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,520
But even if she practiced for decades,

562
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,520
she would not be able to win.

563
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,040
That's it.

564
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:20,920
However,

565
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,760
how could her highness be happy

566
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,680
after seeing this?

567
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:44,070
What did I say?

568
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:45,470
She could surely make it. Look.

569
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:50,110
Well.

570
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:51,560
What about this lotus-nuts sweet soup with osmanthus?

571
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,950
Have a sweet baby early.

572
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:53,680
Then

573
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,470
what about these double-yolked eggs?

574
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:56,920
Have two babies.

575
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,160
Why are you here?

576
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,110
Follow the sound.

577
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:30,560
Rong

578
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:31,830
I've already sent someone

579
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:34,000
to root out that scandalous tabloid.

580
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,760
The three-year agreement between me and Chi Hong

581
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,230
is only her unilateral wish.

582
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:42,230
I, Qin Shangcheng, have never

583
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:43,350
made any promises

584
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,760
nor will I ever make any promises with any woman

585
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,710
in the future.

586
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,190
What if that's our daughter?

587
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:54,760
If it's our daughter,

588
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,880
that's another story.

589
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:57,920
But even if we have a daughter,

590
00:24:58,470 --> 00:24:59,590
Rong is still the person I care about the most.

591
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:01,400
The lover of the previous life

592
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,190
is never as important as the wife of this life.

593
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:05,000
When the time comes,

594
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,640
I will do my duty

595
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,160
as a father and husband

596
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:09,160
to give you a warm and reliable home,

597
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,000
just like the shell of a hermit crab,

598
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,590
sheltering you from the wind and rain

599
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,000
and protect you.

600
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:17,640
But I don't want a daughter.

601
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:20,110
Why?

602
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,950
Because even the best women

603
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:25,710
will be bound by the common customs

604
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:27,800
and trapped in a courtyard,

605
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:29,520
assisting their husbands, educating their children,

606
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,470
and losing their freedom.

607
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,760
There's no way to fulfill their dreams.

608
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:06,830
General Hua, happy wedding!

609
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:07,590
Happy wedding!

610
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:09,430
Wish General Hua a happy wedding.

611
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:10,800
Rong,

612
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,710
you will be married in a few days.

613
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,800
We decided to indulge one more time

614
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,710
before you get married.

615
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:17,000
Let's get drunk tonight.

616
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:19,760
In my experience,

617
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,160
there will be few opportunities like this

618
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,520
after marriage.

619
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,590
Thank you.

620
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,310
Rong

621
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,590
Is there something on your mind?

622
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:35,710
Tang Chudie fell from the altar after getting
married and having children.

623
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:37,920
Marriage is actually the epitaph of heroines.

624
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,760
Her highness is unhappy because of this.

625
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,430
But why did Tang Chudie retire

626
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:46,520
after she got married?

627
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:48,520
To assist husband and educate children.

628
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,760
That's the ultimate destination

629
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,520
of women.

630
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:05,760
Qin is considerate.

631
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:07,800
He will not be like ordinary people,

632
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,000
forcing you to stay at home

633
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,710
and have children,

634
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:10,280
right?

635
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:16,000
No.

636
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,110
The problem is not getting married.

637
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:19,710
It's giving birth to child.

638
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,830
Is there a difference?

639
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:22,950
Of course.

640
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:23,520
Think about it.

641
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,590
When her highness was in Mingzhou,

642
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:25,520
she swore that

643
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,680
she wouldn't marry anyone else but My Lord, right?

644
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,190
So,

645
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:29,920
her highness does want to marry My Lord,

646
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,070
but she saw in the tabloid that

647
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:33,310
Tang Chudie retired because of her pregnancy.

648
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,680
So you have to think this way:

649
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,880
If her highness is pregnant,

650
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,160
will you let her punish the bad and help the good?

651
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:37,640
Will you

652
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:39,760
let her be Swordwoman Huahua?

653
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:43,830
Right?

654
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:45,190
It makes sense.

655
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,310
Come on, Rong.

656
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:51,920
I don't believe it.

657
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:53,520
Our Island Lord is also a man.

658
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:56,110
Men will let women have children,

659
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,190
and then leave their wives

660
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:58,830
at home to take care of the children.

661
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:00,760
But they will be free and

662
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,520
happy outside.

663
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,520
Rong

664
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,110
Hui

665
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:14,640
What's this?

666
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,430
It's too bitter.

667
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:19,190
This is the detox soup for pregnant women

668
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:21,760
that Zhang Xian stewed for me.

669
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:24,830
The island has a lot of miasma and dampness.

670
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:25,800
Drinking this can prevent the baby

671
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,160
from getting eczema after birth.

672
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,470
Hui

673
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,680
You don't drink this every day

674
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,830
just because you're pregnant, do you?

675
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,110
My Lord,

676
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,680
I am

677
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,680
a rough man

678
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:46,400
and don't know how to be slick.

679
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:48,160
I'll say anything

680
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:50,430
when I'm with Hui.

681
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,560
Hui also thinks it's good for me.

682
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:54,800
Go on.

683
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,280
I think

684
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:00,880
her highness

685
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,430
is not worried about giving birth.

686
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,560
She is worried that after having a child,

687
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:09,040
she will be bound by this family

688
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,800
and lose her freedom.

689
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,400
Just like this crab.

690
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,110
I think

691
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:22,760
you should throw away

692
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:24,710
this shell.

693
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,920
Isn't it good to fight side by side

694
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:28,920
with her highness?

695
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,760
Zhang Xian, such a waste.

696
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,520
And I think

697
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,710
you're looking for trouble.

698
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:33,880
This crab shell is obviously

699
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,680
the home My Lord prepared for her highness, right?

700
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:36,950
You...

701
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:37,310
You...

702
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:39,430
Are you instigating her highness to run away from home?

703
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:51,430
You two,

704
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:54,310
remove all the decoration of the wedding room.

705
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,310
What?

706
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:00,760
Your fault.

707
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,190
Remove them.

708
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,400
I'm leaving.

709
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,310
Wait.

710
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,110
Zhang Xian,

711
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:12,520
isn't your house over there?

712
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,230
Oh, no.

713
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:48,230
Rong

714
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:48,950
Easy.

715
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:49,640
No hurry.

716
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:50,680
I just saw

717
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,470
Zhang Xian and the others secretly removed

718
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:53,310
the decoration of the wedding room.

719
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,040
What?

720
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,400
Where's Qin Shangcheng?

721
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,230
He was seen on the pirate ship.

722
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,110
He wouldn't think that

723
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:00,280
you didn't want to get married

724
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,560
and left in anger, would he?

725
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,280
I'll go check.

726
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:09,400
Qin Shangcheng

727
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:18,560
Rong

728
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:20,560
What kind of home do you want

729
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,160
after we get married?

730
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,470
A home with you.

731
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,070
What about specifics?

732
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:27,830
Like,

733
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,880
what kind of house do you want to live in?

734
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:32,310
Let me think about it.

735
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,160
I hope our home can be full of flowers

736
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,880
after we get married.

737
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:38,400
After all, I am Swordwoman Huahua.

738
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:41,800
It's better to be balloon flower.

739
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:42,880
Because balloon flower

740
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,160
symbolizes sincere and everlasting love.

741
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:11,880
Where is him?

742
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:33,590
Do you like this gift?

743
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,590
Yes.

744
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,710
I have another gift for you.

745
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:38,680
What?

746
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:44,160
Who takes crabs as gifts?

747
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:46,680
These are not ordinary crabs,

748
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,190
but calappa.

749
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,800
To be precise,

750
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,560
it's a calappa couple.

751
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:53,400
It is said that male calappa

752
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,560
love their wives more than

753
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,710
any other animals in the world.

754
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,070
No matter where they go

755
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:58,830
they are always together.

756
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:01,520
Whenever there is danger,

757
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,230
the male crab will hide the female crab

758
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:04,640
and guard it by himself.

759
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:08,760
But as long as one of them dies,

760
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:11,150
the other one will not live alone.

761
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:15,580
Rong

762
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:17,120
Do you think we two

763
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:19,040
are like this calappa couple

764
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,280
who live and die together?

765
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:22,800
Are you silly?

766
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,909
I restored the furnishings of Hua Residence

767
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:32,710
for you on Huarong Island

768
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:34,280
as our wedding room and new home.

769
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,120
But now I figured it out.

770
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:38,040
As long as we're together,

771
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:39,560
everywhere can be our home.

772
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,360
So you made the pirate ship

773
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,909
our home.

774
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:46,280
In this way,

775
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,870
whenever you want to punish the bad,

776
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:49,000
I can set sail

777
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:51,230
with you and our new home

778
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,080
immediately.

779
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:56,280
OK.

780
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:12,000
Rong

781
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:17,710
I want you to know that

782
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,320
you don't have to give up your heroine dream.

783
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,360
Whether it is our home,

784
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:23,520
our marriage,

785
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:25,040
or our children,

786
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:27,670
they will not be the reason to bind you,

787
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,150
but will become the strongest support

788
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:31,280
and haven behind you.

789
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:33,520
I will wait for the day

790
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:35,360
when you let go of all your worries

791
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,840
and are willing to marry me.

792
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,470
I know,

793
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:43,150
as a girl,

794
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:44,760
you must worry about

795
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:47,000
how to balance your home

796
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:49,040
and your dreams after marriage.

797
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,150
But if someone

798
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,520
has to make a sacrifice,

799
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,520
I want that person to be me.

800
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,760
If there is only one person between Swordman Yunhe

801
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,120
and Swordwoman Huahua who can be famous,

802
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,840
I hope that person to be you.

803
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,390
What if I don't want to have children

804
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,120
after we get married?

805
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:15,390
I really want a child

806
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:17,760
that belongs to us,

807
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,670
but if you don't want to,

808
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,150
then follow your heart.

809
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,430
Anyway,

810
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,230
it is enough for me

811
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,320
to have you by my side.

812
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,670
What if I become ugly

813
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:33,080
or my figure is out of shape

814
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,520
after getting married?

815
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,870
Or what if

816
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:37,390
I get old after many years?

817
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:39,430
I'm sure I'll love you as much as I do now.

818
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,230
I will love you more day by day.

819
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:44,630
Maybe I'm not good enough now,

820
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:45,800
but I'll work hard

821
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,710
and try to be your

822
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,560
perfect husband.

823
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,230
Great.

824
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,560
I'll also work hard

825
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:56,710
to try to be your perfect wife.

826
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:18,950
Mother,

827
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,600
it's been ten years,

828
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,670
and it's time to write to you every year.

829
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,320
How are you doing in heaven?

830
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,040
A lot has happened this year.

831
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,320
I topped the list of Jianghu heroines.

832
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:37,080
It's always been my dream to be Swordwoman Huahua

833
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:38,390
to punish the bad

834
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,150
and to help those in need.

835
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,320
You said that

836
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,320
this white dove you left for me

837
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:48,280
can take my words to heaven.

838
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:50,670
I want to tell you that

839
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:53,190
I am getting closer to my dream.

840
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,870
From

841
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:57,320
your little white dove.

842
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:40,470
You are later than usual this year.

843
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:42,910
I saved you back then,

844
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:46,190
but I didn't expect you to come back every year.

845
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,080
I got to know your master because of you.

846
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:50,470
My lord

847
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:53,560
My lord

848
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:54,670
Letter from His Royal Highness.

849
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:03,630
My lord

850
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,190
How is the battle?

851
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:07,950
Our army has agreed to

852
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:09,430
negotiate peace with Tianchu.

853
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:14,950
You spent a lot of money and effort

854
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:16,670
to buy the distribution map

855
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:17,800
of Tianchu granaries.

856
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,430
I thought it could solve the problem of the

857
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:20,800
shortage of food for the front-line army.

858
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:22,040
I didn't expect

859
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:24,150
the spies of Xuanling

860
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:26,040
to be fooled by a pirate.

861
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:30,190
Qin Shangcheng is not an ordinary pirate.

862
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:31,870
Don't forget that

863
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:34,150
the treasure of the previous dynasty

864
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:35,560
with the Rapier is still hidden by him.

865
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:37,280
You have been dormant in Tianchu for so many years

866
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,670
to find the Rapier.

867
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Who would have thought that

868
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,520
it was hidden in Wanjiang.

869
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,150
If it wasn't Qin Shangcheng

870
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,670
who brought this treasure back,

871
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:47,630
I don't know how long

872
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:49,360
you would have to be a hostage in Tianchu.

873
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:51,870
But now this treasure

874
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:53,000
is still in Qin Shangcheng's hands.

875
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:54,950
How can we get it?

876
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:56,000
Don't worry.

877
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,950
My father has set a plan.

878
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:00,840
We can not only get the Rapier,

879
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:02,630
but also return to South Desolation.

880
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,150
Great.

881
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:05,320
Congratulations, my lord.

882
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,670
You can finally be free

883
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:09,150
and go to find the little dove girl.

884
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,150
Little white dove,

885
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:12,520
this time

886
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,190
I will surely find you.

887
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:28,910
What are you painting?

888
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,120
Look,

889
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,320
we have completed such a big task

890
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,080
in Mingzhou this time,

891
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:34,560
and it's the first time we work together.

892
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:35,910
So I'm thinking that

893
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:37,560
there will be many opportunities like this in the future.

894
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:38,360
Then I want to

895
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,910
have our exclusive logo

896
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:41,840
when we fight for righteousness in the future.

897
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:43,710
I have the same thought.

898
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:45,280
Let me take a look.

899
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,080
Look.

900
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:48,000
Yun Hua Couple,

901
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:49,150
a letter from each of our names.

902
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:49,800
Isn't it

903
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,520
cute?

904
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:52,390
As cute as you.

905
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,120
But a little lacking in momentum.

906
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,190
It seems so.

907
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:56,390
Look at my painting.

908
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:57,280
OK.

909
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,230
Qin Shangcheng

910
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,840
I think if you want to copy,

911
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,150
we have to find someone with a heroic temperament.

912
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,630
This one looks

913
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:15,390
exactly like a pirate's logo.

914
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:16,870
We haven't fight for righteousness yet,

915
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:17,710
people would scared away.

916
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,280
Why is it so hard to come up with a logo?

917
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:25,710
Rong

918
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,080
Painting is indeed

919
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,040
one of my few weaknesses.

920
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,430
Wait for me to study.

921
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:32,560
I will definitely make it.

922
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:35,630
But if you don't stop being so cute,

923
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:37,360
I can't help but eat you.

924
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:39,280
Eat.

925
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:40,800
Right.

926
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,800
A crane carries a flower into the sky.

927
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,360
It has both momentum and taste.

928
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:46,360
This is good.

929
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,470
Your favorite flower is balloon flower.

930
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:49,840
Let's draw it in the logo.

931
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,520
OK.

932
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:52,560
Please.

933
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:54,150
Please.

934
00:41:57,670 --> 00:41:58,280
After you.

935
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:58,710
OK.

936
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:02,120
I'll draw the body.

937
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,430
Well done.
