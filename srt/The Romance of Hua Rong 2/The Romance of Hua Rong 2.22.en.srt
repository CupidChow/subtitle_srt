3
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,479
The Lord and Her Highness

4
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:45,630
are finally together.

5
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,160
We can be rest assured.

6
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,630
Zhang,

7
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,270
I told you,

8
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,950
they are not ordinary couples.

9
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,080
They have deep feelings

10
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,160
and can't leave each other,

11
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:57,759
you know?

12
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:03,360
Why are you looking at me?

13
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:04,510
Qian.

14
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,190
You're back.

15
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:06,910
Up yours.

16
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,470
I did it all for the princess.

17
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:12,720
Do you think my trick worked or not?

18
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,830
I don't know.

19
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,030
But,

20
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,000
if you are always like this,

21
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,360
even if the princess likes you,

22
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,829
what she likes is not the real you.

23
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,550
In fact, I know

24
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:33,550
what you said.

25
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:34,880
You see,

26
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,000
she is so kind,

27
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:37,960
so lovely

28
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,079
and has a sense of justice,

29
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:39,750
right?

30
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:41,630
Unlike other princesses,

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,360
right?

32
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:44,030
Even though I am excellent,

33
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,800
I still don't think I deserve her.

34
00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:48,720
So tell me,

35
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,829
if I don't change myself,

36
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,320
what else can I do?

37
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,800
You said,

38
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,000
when our Lord's business

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,960
is over,

40
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,880
you will confess to her,

41
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,320
right?

42
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,670
How do you know if you don't try?

43
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:00,880
I dare not.

44
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,720
When did you become so cowardly?

45
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,190
You are nothing like yourself.

46
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,320
I'm not

47
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:07,800
a coward.

48
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,240
Your love

49
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,800
is going very well.

50
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,240
You don't understand.

51
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,750
That is,

52
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,079
when you really care about someone, you will become

53
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,240
swayed by considerations of gain and loss.

54
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,520
You're afraid

55
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,320
you can't bear

56
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,440
the result,

57
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:25,320
right?

58
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:28,079
If the princess refuses me,

59
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,880
I may not even be a donkey.

60
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:35,470
So you plan to keep acting like this?

61
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,360
I don't care,

62
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,160
right?

63
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,270
Just pretend to be reserved and cold, right?

64
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:40,910
I can do anything

65
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,960
the princess likes,

66
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,520
can't I?

67
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,550
I'm telling you...

68
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,320
Stop.

69
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,880
Can you let me finish?

70
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,600
I only love the princess in my life.

71
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,079
Even if I deceive myself all my life,

72
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:50,670
I don't care.

73
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:51,320
I like her.

74
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,240
I like her.

75
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:52,600
Can I?

76
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,390
I am happy.

77
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,720
So in your heart,

78
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,470
I am so superficial.

79
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:04,520
I'm sorry.

80
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:06,160
I...

81
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:07,080
I'm drunk.

82
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,470
I just talked nonsense.

83
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,830
Stopping talking nonsense.

84
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,910
Men

85
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,720
should keep their promises.

86
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:28,950
You remember,

87
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,790
I like you

88
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:33,200
because you protected me

89
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,760
in times of crisis,

90
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,230
because you can sacrifice

91
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:38,200
your own life for me,

92
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,720
and because you can do everything

93
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,600
for Your Lord.

94
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:42,760
Do you understand?

95
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,920
So I officially announce,

96
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,390
from now on,

97
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,880
you will be promoted from my little donkey

98
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,830
to my favorite friend.

99
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,230
A friend of what kind?

100
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,950
Boyfriend, of course.

101
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,350
Your Highness.

102
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:31,790
The maid said you haven't had breakfast yet.

103
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:32,950
Please take care of yourself.

104
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,880
How's it going with Yi Feichi?

105
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:38,159
The news has just been sent by shadow guards.

106
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,110
As you expected,

107
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,320
shadow guards found bloody gauze and dregs

108
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,550
in the ruined temple near Spring-back Hall.

109
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,270
It should be Yi Feichi.

110
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:48,880
Although he is not in the ruined temple now,

111
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,390
I guess he should go out to buy medicine.

112
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:54,040
Shadow guards have been waiting in ambush in ruined temple.

113
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,390
Let's start now.

114
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:08,830
It seems that the Lord has mastered

115
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,320
the situation about Yi Feichi.

116
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,390
Let's catch up.

117
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,110
Don't worry.

118
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,670
With the compass,

119
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:14,720
we will find him.

120
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,760
There must be shadow guards

121
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,160
of Prince Mu's Residence following him,

122
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,000
so we are easily exposed.

123
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,070
Let me inform Qian.

124
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,830
Don't pause and ponder due to what people said.

125
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:33,790
Don't pause and ponder due to what people said.

126
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,790
Keep your own path and practice it alone.

127
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,270
Keep your own path and practice it alone.

128
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:39,920
Little Rice Cake.

129
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:42,040
Do you know the meaning of this sentence?

130
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,200
Do you know?

131
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,270
We don't know.

132
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,440
This sentence means,

133
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,200
Don't pause and ponder due to what others said,

134
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,640
adhere to your own mind

135
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:54,550
and practice on your own path.

136
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,159
As long as you think what you are doing

137
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:57,880
is right,

138
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,920
you don't have to care what other people

139
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:00,670
think or say.

140
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:01,790
Got it?

141
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,510
We got it.

142
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:10,830
Little Moon Cake.

143
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,320
Lead everyone to read it.

144
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,200
My Lord.

145
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,640
Hua Rong followed Qin Shangcheng

146
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,790
to the south of the city.

147
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,480
Our people followed them too.

148
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:26,270
This South Desolation Prince is efficient.

149
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,350
No wonder my cousin raved about him.

150
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:39,760
Master Yi.

151
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,510
Who is he?

152
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,270
Crown Prince.

153
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,720
So

154
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,110
you are Qin Shangcheng who betrayed Tianchu.

155
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:55,760
Don't waste your time.

156
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,760
I knew this day might come,

157
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,320
so I've destroyed the drawing of cannon.

158
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,350
It doesn't matter.

159
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,350
We still have you.

160
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:04,440
Take him down.

161
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,670
Qin Shangcheng.

162
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,880
Master Yi is from Tianchu,

163
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:17,550
so he should come with us.

164
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,440
Hua Rong.

165
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,950
How did you find this place?

166
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,200
I guess

167
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,270
they followed us here.

168
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:24,790
That's right.

169
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,640
We did follow you here.

170
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,720
Although Her Highness has broken up with you,

171
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,640
she still knows you well.

172
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,200
And now there is no way

173
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,030
to find Master Yi more easily

174
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,440
than following you.

175
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:35,880
How dare you.

176
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,549
The prince is not someone

177
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:38,280
you can talk about at will.

178
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,030
Rong.

179
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,909
I can give in to anything else,

180
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,640
but not this time.

181
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,280
I promised my father,

182
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,910
I must take Yi Feichi with me today.

183
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,350
Ok.

184
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,230
Don't blame me for being merciless.

185
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,320
You really think you guys

186
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,760
can take away Yi Feichi?

187
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,440
What about me?

188
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,840
My Lord.

189
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:06,440
What brings you here?

190
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,470
Little Rice Cake saw you coming here.

191
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:10,910
I'm worried something will happen to you,

192
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:11,880
so I came to have a look.

193
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,230
Fortunately, I arrived in time.

194
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,030
Who is he?

195
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,520
General Jin,

196
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:20,400
the representative of Wanjiang for peace talks.

197
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,840
I don't think

198
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,550
it's a good idea to continue this stalemate.

199
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,840
Since that we have caught him together,

200
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,880
how about finding a place to interrogate him together?

201
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:35,710
Sure.

202
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,670
No problem.

203
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,150
Where are we going to interrogate him?

204
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,350
Liuyun Pavilion.

205
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:00,470
It's done.

206
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:05,840
Don't play games.

207
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,110
Will you draw it or not?

208
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,110
How can you draw it?

209
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,200
You can say what you want.

210
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,550
We will try our best to satisfy you.

211
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:18,590
Guys.

212
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,320
I'm just practicing.

213
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:21,960
The real drawing of cannon

214
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,760
is extremely energy-consuming

215
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,200
and requires full attention.

216
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,840
With so many of you around me,

217
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,110
I am under too much pressure

218
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:30,400
to draw it.

219
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:32,320
Sometimes pressure is also the driving force.

220
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,320
Master Yi is from Tianchu,

221
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,080
so it's not up to you, South Desolation Prince,

222
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,110
to judge.

223
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:41,200
Rong.

224
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,520
You must go against me, right?

225
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:43,710
Qin Shangcheng.

226
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:44,910
You make it clear, I am now

227
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,230
the representative of Tianchu for peace talks,

228
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,710
so there is nothing to do between you and me

229
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:50,670
except the enemy relationship.

230
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:56,880
Amazing.

231
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,230
They

232
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,470
seem to be cruel and aggressive

233
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,280
to each other,

234
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,440
but in fact they are flirting

235
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,320
with each other.

236
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,280
They are like a discordant couple.

237
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:05,710
Yeah.

238
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,590
What is the relationship between them?

239
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,760
Rong loves the wrong person.

240
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,150
The prince

241
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:14,840
personally killed her father,

242
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,150
his father-in-law.

243
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,000
Oh.

244
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,640
Although he was very handsome,

245
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,960
he betrayed his country,

246
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,000
abandoned his wife and killed his father-in-law.

247
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:24,910
Indeed as expected, all that glitters is not gold.

248
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,150
Talk too much.

249
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,030
Your Highness.

250
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,150
Now how to let Yi Feichi

251
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,470
tell the truth

252
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:33,550
is the key.

253
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,150
Let's take turns

254
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,400
interrogating him.

255
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,790
How to group?

256
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,590
Let me be with you.

257
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:43,790
No.

258
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,400
People in the three countries work together

259
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,200
to check and balance each other.

260
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,150
So,

261
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,470
I'm with you.

262
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:50,590
Fuqin.

263
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:51,670
You are with Rong.

264
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,910
Once someone gets the drawing,

265
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,110
inform everyone immediately.

266
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,350
Such grouping,

267
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,030
each group has people from both countries,

268
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,200
is reasonable.

269
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,400
But, in my opinion,

270
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,640
even if we take turns to interrogate him,

271
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,670
he will not tell the truth easily.

272
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:15,790
He refused to say it.

273
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,790
Continue.

274
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:24,520
Heartbreaker!

275
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,880
When you blame others,

276
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,590
please don't just listen to one side of the story.

277
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,710
Please give others a chance to explain.

278
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:40,280
Even if you are eloquent,

279
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:41,790
you will not be able to reverse

280
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:42,670
our view of you, heartbreaker.

281
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,280
In that case,

282
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,000
go ahead.

283
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,590
I didn't think,

284
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,640
in order to leave the hope of life to Rong,

285
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,230
you not only transferred Life-killing Poison

286
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,320
into your body,

287
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,790
but also pretended to marry others

288
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,960
in order to let her forget you

289
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:08,400
and bear everything alone.

290
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,520
Yep.

291
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,640
Although you

292
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,030
accidentally killed your father-in-law

293
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,440
for the last time to see your wife,

294
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,640
you loved her so much.

295
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,520
You are the spooniest man

296
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,030
in the world.

297
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:22,550
Yep.

298
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:24,110
So now,

299
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,320
I still hope, you can give me the drawing of cannon

300
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,320
and I will give it to Hua Rong

301
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,910
to make amends for my faults.

302
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,440
In order to let us be together again,

303
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:33,280
please

304
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:34,760
draw it.

305
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,880
I am knowledgeable.

306
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,350
The books I have read

307
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:46,320
do not allow me

308
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:48,440
to betray my country.

309
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:49,910
And

310
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:52,400
I am a little hungry after listening to the story.

311
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,520
Is there anything to eat?

312
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:55,640
Yes.

313
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,150
Bear's heart and leopard's gall.

314
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,320
Do you dare to eat?

315
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,670
Coaxing doesn't work, so you want to force me?

316
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,640
I'm telling you,

317
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:10,230
the most important thing

318
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,590
we scholars care about is integrity,

319
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:12,670
and the second is life.

320
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:14,520
Even if I die,

321
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,000
I won't let you get the drawing.

322
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:19,840
He pissed me off.

323
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,840
I can't stand him any more.

324
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,200
My Lord.

325
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:21,670
Let's kill him.

326
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:22,550
Anyway, we can't get the drawing.

327
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:23,710
Killing him is another kind of balance

328
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:24,590
to achieve peace.

329
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,550
I don't believe you are willing to kill me.

330
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,590
My Lord.

331
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:35,110
Do it.

332
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:46,760
I'll draw it now.

333
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:49,960
Please.

334
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:50,640
Draw it.

335
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,150
At the critical moment,

336
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,030
you still have to rely on me

337
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:55,960
to ask Yi Feichi

338
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,350
to help us draw the drawing,

339
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:59,080
and yet Jin Tong and Fuqin have not found out,

340
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,910
he has reached an agreement with us.

341
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:02,790
Your Highness.

342
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,110
Your Highness.

343
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,590
The letter from Qin said,

344
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:07,400
the drawing is almost finished by Yi Feichi.

345
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:09,000
Fuqin will do it tonight.

346
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,230
Yeah.

347
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,470
So tonight,

348
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:12,960
let's do our part

349
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,840
and follow the plan.

350
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,110
Why are you taking my sword?

351
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:42,080
Give it to me.

352
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:46,550
Fuqin.

353
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:49,320
Are you breaking the rules?

354
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,080
Rules are set

355
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,150
by those who rule the world.

356
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,280
You can try

357
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,550
whether your leg is faster

358
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,710
or my sword is faster.

359
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:01,960
Take it.

360
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,110
Can you swim?

361
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,110
Yes.

362
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,320
That's good.

363
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,080
What's the matter?

364
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,110
Because we are about to fall in love.

365
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,440
Zhang.

366
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,520
Our Lord and Her Highness asked us

367
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,400
to watch Jin Tong here,

368
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,230
and stop him once he left,

369
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,670
instead of letting your eyes stare at him

370
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,710
unblinkingly,

371
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,910
which is bad for your eyes.

372
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,710
Looking at you will make me blind faster.

373
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:50,880
Up yours.

374
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,430
Master Yi.

375
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,430
Here we come.

376
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,400
This dry well is gateway to outside of City.

377
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,880
General Yan Qing, the city guard of Tianlu City,

378
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,110
will meet you in person.

379
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,280
I wanted to go to Liuyun Pavilion

380
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,230
to find General Hua Jr.

381
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,070
But Liuyun Pavilion is surrounded by many spies,

382
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:59,560
so I can't get close to it.

383
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:00,760
But

384
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,000
in this way, I was surprised

385
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,310
to enjoy a good show.

386
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,000
You pretended so well

387
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:08,000
that you almost cheated me.

388
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,350
Master Yi.

389
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,190
After listening to the story

390
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,310
and watching the play,

391
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:13,680
you can take the drawing of cannon

392
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,070
and set foot on the road to your hometown.

393
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,040
What do you mean?

394
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:28,400
I'm cautious.

395
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,280
I trust you.

396
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,070
But I haven't been in contact with Yan Qing.

397
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:32,800
So I'm not very confident.

398
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,040
For me,

399
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,430
it's safer

400
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,430
if the drawing isn't on me.

401
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,590
If the enemy gets it,

402
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,350
my life is worthless.

403
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,280
This is...

404
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,350
Give this half drawing to General Yan Qing

405
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:00,310
and tell him

406
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:01,560
I have the other half.

407
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:03,640
In this way, he can report to his superiors,

408
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,520
and you don't have to worry about his infidelity.

409
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:11,310
That's a good idea.

410
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:14,520
I gotta go.

411
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,070
It has been five years since I left Tianchu,

412
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:19,520
and I can finally go home.

413
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:20,880
Master Yi.

414
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:22,000
Take care.

415
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,110
Qin Shangcheng.

416
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,950
Isn't it time for the play to end?

417
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:37,760
Before signing the agreement of trilateral peace talks,

418
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,160
it's better for me to

419
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:40,880
stay with Duanmu Qingcang,

420
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,190
so as to better protect you.

421
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:47,230
But I'm afraid he'll take it out on you.

422
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:49,590
Don't worry.

423
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,040
Even if he suspects me,

424
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,400
he can't find any evidence.

425
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,040
Fine.

426
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,830
Since you are so confident,

427
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:58,560
we will accompany you to finish the play.

428
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:27,560
Master Yi, I hope you are well.

429
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,590
I knew Rong would help you

430
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:41,400
escape to Tianchu,

431
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,070
so I've been waiting for you for a long time.

432
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:44,560
How do you know this secret passage?

433
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,350
Do well and have well.

434
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,590
The orphans I rescued

435
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,160
told me that they found a secret base

436
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,880
that could lead to the outside of the city.

437
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,880
I guess it must be the secret passage

438
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,190
that Rong dug to escape from South Desolation.

439
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:58,520
I didn't think I was right.

440
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,070
General Yan Qing.

441
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:01,920
I'm here.

442
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,110
I know

443
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:13,590
I can't escape today.

444
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,680
But I will never let you

445
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,160
get this drawing of cannon.

446
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:19,920
Where are you going?

447
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,800
Go to a place where no one knows me

448
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,280
and I don't know anyone.

449
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,400
Why do you have to do this?

450
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:30,590
You promised me,

451
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,710
you would give me an answer

452
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:32,640
when you finished your family affairs.

453
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,160
This is your decision?

454
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:35,430
We're not meant for each other.

455
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,430
Thank you for taking care of me these days.

456
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,400
I'll return the favor.

457
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,070
If you want to return the favor,

458
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:47,640
use your whole life to return it.

459
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,880
I may not be able to do it.

460
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:52,680
Why?

461
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:56,280
Your leg is hurt,

462
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,160
so you don't want to get me into trouble?

463
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,710
It doesn't matter.

464
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:00,280
I've looked for Hua Sanlang to return to

465
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,350
Imperial Alliance and searched all medical books.

466
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,760
He finally found

467
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,040
a cure for your leg.

468
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,520
It's no use.

469
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:09,920
I gotta go.

470
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,040
Take care of yourself.

471
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:15,560
What are you doing?

472
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,430
I thought that crutch was ugly, so I threw it away.

473
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,640
From today on,

474
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,520
I will be your leg.

475
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,040
You are forcing others,

476
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,190
so you are not a lady.

477
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,160
I don't want to be a lady,

478
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,520
I just want to be a free pirate.

479
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:26,920
If you insist on leaving,

480
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,590
you can go anywhere you like

481
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,920
when I cure your leg.

482
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,640
Leave me alone, okay?

483
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,190
Shut up.

484
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,430
I'm already like this without a crutch,

485
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:59,110
so why are you make an unnecessary move?

486
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:00,880
You'll see in a moment.

487
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:07,470
What are you doing?

488
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:10,000
This is the way that Hua Sanlang

489
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,760
found in Imperial Alliance Medical Canon.

490
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,070
Exposing the injured bones

491
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,110
and pricking the acupoints with needles

492
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:16,070
can stimulate meridians of legs

493
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:17,400
to the maximum extent and rejuvenate people.

494
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,400
It's no use.

495
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:20,800
The tendons on my legs have been connected

496
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,710
but I am unconscious, which is enough to

497
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,640
prove that they are all necrotic.

498
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,230
It's no use stimulating them.

499
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:27,520
It's a waste of time.

500
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:30,190
How do we know if we don't try?

501
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,830
After so many years at sea,

502
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,350
my favorite thing to do

503
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:36,560
is to make the impossible possible.

504
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:38,310
Do as you please.

505
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,110
Why is she so precise in finding acupoints?

506
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,590
Near misses.

507
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:54,470
It seems that what I learned

508
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:56,000
from Hua Sanlang these days was not in vain.

509
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:58,230
If I let him do it,

510
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,680
I'm a little uneasy.

511
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:04,400
What happened to your arm?

512
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:06,190
It doesn't matter.

513
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,640
There is always a price to pay

514
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,710
for learning a new skill.

515
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:09,920
Oh.

516
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,680
I must prick your acupoints

517
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,760
with silver needles three times a day.

518
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,230
I'll come back at noon.

519
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,190
Have a good rest.

520
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,040
Rong, what's wrong?

521
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:34,280
General Yan Qing wrote

522
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,280
Yi Feichi died at the tunnel exit last night,

523
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,830
and the other half of the cannon drawing was gone.

524
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,040
How did this happen?

525
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,350
I'm going to ask you three.

526
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,160
Your Highness.

527
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:45,000
You mean, Jin Tong?

528
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,520
That's impossible.

529
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,760
I kept an eye on Jin Tong

530
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,230
until you came back last night.

531
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:51,760
He was in the room and never went out.

532
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,830
He stayed up all night reading,

533
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:53,880
and didn't move.

534
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:55,680
It's over.

535
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,040
Why didn't you say earlier?

536
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,230
Does anyone stay still while reading a book?

537
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:00,280
Doesn't he turn the pages?

538
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,470
There must be something bad going on.

539
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:02,160
Yeah.

540
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,680
I thought he, like me,

541
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,190
fell asleep after reading the first page.

542
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:07,190
Why was he the only one watching?

543
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,350
What were you two doing?

544
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,350
Your Highness.

545
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:12,640
Your Highness.

546
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,350
It's my fault.

547
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,830
It's my fault that my shoulder is so reliable

548
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,230
that the princess can't help wanting to rely on it.

549
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,710
It's the princess's fault.

550
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:22,590
It's the princess's fault that her sleep is so charming

551
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:24,950
that it fascinates me so much.

552
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,950
Rong.

553
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,040
Don't be angry.

554
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,520
Let Qian and I make amends, OK?

555
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,350
Yeah, Your Highness.

556
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:35,680
Come here.

557
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,310
Your Highness, it's a good plan.

558
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,430
I'll tell my Lord now.

559
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:44,470
Let's go.

560
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:47,230
Who killed Yi Feichi?

561
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,280
You.

562
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:52,800
Me?

563
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,560
What's wrong with you?

564
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:04,710
Don't play dumb.

565
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,470
You killed Master Yi, right?

566
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,640
Rong.

567
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,310
You misunderstood him.

568
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:13,070
We were watching him

569
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:14,590
outside his door yesterday.

570
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:16,070
He didn't even go out.

571
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:18,110
How could he be the murderer of Yi Feichi?

572
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:20,800
Are you sure?

573
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,280
Yes.

574
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,350
We never left.

575
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:29,040
I was wrong about you.

576
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,190
I'm sorry.

577
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:32,880
Goodbye.

578
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:35,070
Wait a minute.

579
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:38,560
So,

580
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,430
you were the one

581
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,710
who let Yi Feichi go last night.

582
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:43,000
You're right.

583
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,040
I'm bold to do it and accept responsibility for it.

584
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,190
Master Yi comes from Tianchu.

585
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,280
I saved him for granted.

586
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,400
Now,

587
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,760
you should get the drawing of cannon.

588
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:57,470
I only got half of it.

589
00:27:58,710 --> 00:27:59,950
The other half is with Master Yi.

590
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:02,310
I wanted him to bring it back to Tianchu,

591
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,640
but I didn't think he was killed.

592
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,640
If you didn't kill

593
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,040
Master Yi,

594
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:15,680
who did this?

595
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:20,920
I think you already know it.

596
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,920
Qin Shangcheng.

597
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:32,040
Cheng.

598
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,470
You killed Yi Feichi?

599
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,520
I had to do it.

600
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:40,160
When I stopped him at the underpass,

601
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,160
he was about to destroy the drawing of cannon.

602
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:42,640
If I hadn't killed him,

603
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:44,710
I wouldn't have even got this half.

604
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:45,590
Half?

605
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,950
Why?

606
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,310
I searched him carefully.

607
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:53,920
He only had half of the drawing.

608
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,400
Where's the other half?

609
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:59,400
Yi Feichi was saved by Rong.

610
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:01,830
She must have the other half.

611
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,950
I already have an overall plan.

612
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,680
If Fuqin

613
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,350
hadn't done it without my permission,

614
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:12,230
you must have a whole drawing

615
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,920
instead of a half one.

616
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,950
In fact, if you don't trust me,

617
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,880
you can find someone else to do these things.

618
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,590
Your Highness, there's a misunderstanding.

619
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,160
This has nothing to do with His Majesty.

620
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,680
I was eager to make contributions

621
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,880
and ruined your plan.

622
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:29,230
I was wrong.

623
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,560
Please punish me.

624
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,800
How dare you.

625
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,830
You deserve to be killed, but because now

626
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:39,160
is the time when people are needed,

627
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,520
I'll spare your life for the time being.

628
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,310
You should follow Cheng's order,

629
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,880
and never make decisions by for yourself.

630
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:48,950
Thank you, His Majesty.

631
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:55,190
Cheng.

632
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,190
Are you sure you can get the other half

633
00:29:57,190 --> 00:30:00,920
back from Hua Rong?

634
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,640
I already have a plan.

635
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:05,070
But

636
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,400
I need you to lend me

637
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,160
that half.

638
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:21,470
Now that you have a good idea,

639
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,430
let me wait for your good news.

640
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,160
Father.

641
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:30,710
I have one more request.

642
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:31,710
Say it.

643
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,590
I hope after this,

644
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,110
please stop being hard on Rong.

645
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:39,470
I just want them to stay away from disputes

646
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:40,950
and be safe.

647
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,070
If you get the complete drawing,

648
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:51,070
I will promise you.

649
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:52,160
Thank you, father.

650
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,800
It's really different

651
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,280
since you took the field.

652
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:13,400
Not only did you get half of the drawing,

653
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,070
but also passed on the responsibility

654
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:16,310
of killing Yi Feichi to Qin Shangcheng.

655
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,680
Next, let's sit on top of the mountain

656
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,350
to watch the fight between tigers,

657
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,190
reaping advantages whichever side wins.

658
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,760
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

659
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,950
You mean,

660
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,920
she's lying to us?

661
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,920
But according to my observation,

662
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,680
Hua Rong is incompatible with Qin Shangcheng

663
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,280
because he killed her father.

664
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:41,000
In addition, you deceived her,

665
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:43,400
so it is normal for her to suspect

666
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:44,800
that Yi Feichi was killed by Qin Shangcheng.

667
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,590
Wu Ren.

668
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:48,470
Do you know why I

669
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:49,920
can sit in this position

670
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,280
instead of you?

671
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:56,590
Welcome to suggest.

672
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:59,230
Because I never underestimate the enemy.

673
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:01,800
As to whether Hua Rong is deceiving us,

674
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:03,710
hearing is false,

675
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:05,560
seeing is believing.

676
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:12,470
Rong.

677
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:14,000
Do you think Jin Tong will fall for it?

678
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:15,110
I don't think he will.

679
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,400
He looks like

680
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,680
a harmless little sheep,

681
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,350
but in fact he is a vicious wolf

682
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,310
in sheep's clothing.

683
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:21,950
I don't think he can be so gullible.

684
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,430
He won't be taken in easily.

685
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,520
But, our play is only half finished,

686
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,710
and Qin Shangcheng

687
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:28,640
has to cooperate with us

688
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,710
to complete the remaining half.

689
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:31,920
He must be ready to put on a play

690
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,400
to restore the husband's dominance over the wife.

691
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:36,560
I see.

692
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,800
Jin Tong killed Master Yi.

693
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:44,590
Qin Shangcheng.

694
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:45,760
Get the hell out of here.

695
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,190
If you don't forgive me today,

696
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,350
I won't leave.

697
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:51,640
You killed my father, I will never forgive you.

698
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:52,950
If you don't leave today,

699
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:54,400
I will kill you.

700
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,280
Is there really something wrong?

701
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,230
Let me go in and have a look.

702
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:00,040
Let's go.

703
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:03,520
Your Highness and Miss Hua Rong are a couple.

704
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:05,560
It is inconvenient for outsiders to get involved in.

705
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,310
I'm not an outsider.

706
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,070
I'm his brother.

707
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:07,590
Let me in.

708
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,830
He is persuading his wife

709
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:10,560
and saving his family inside.

710
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:11,680
Don't make a mess.

711
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,230
No...

712
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:12,680
I...

713
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,430
Not even you.

714
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,280
You are not eloquent,

715
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:15,710
so you will only make things worse.

716
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:27,920
It's done.

717
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:30,280
Harder here.

718
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:35,830
I will start.

719
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:37,190
Qin Shangcheng.

720
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:38,560
Let me go.

721
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,280
No.

722
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,000
I'll never let you go.

723
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,160
Qin Shangcheng.

724
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,950
You are hurting me.

725
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:48,590
Really?

726
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,680
Of course not.

727
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,560
That's a lie.

728
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,070
Let's continue.

729
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,590
Are you in pain?

730
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,310
My heart hurts even more.

731
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,160
Do you want to deny

732
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,950
our past feelings and memories

733
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:04,070
just because of one mistake?

734
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,310
Smash this.

735
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,389
Qin Shangcheng.

736
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:11,560
Stop it.

737
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,870
We can't go back.

738
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,230
We don't have to go back.

739
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:15,840
Because our future will be better.

740
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:25,949
Rong.

741
00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:28,600
Do we have to go this far?

742
00:34:28,909 --> 00:34:29,800
Qin Shangcheng.

743
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:31,429
We have to be tough

744
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,320
with Jin Tong,

745
00:34:33,429 --> 00:34:35,230
or he will be secretly watching us

746
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:36,190
somewhere now.

747
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,320
Is it a little unlucky?

748
00:34:42,429 --> 00:34:43,280
Don't worry.

749
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,800
It is Qian Dayou's idea.

750
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,760
This handprint belongs to Qian Dayou and Ling.

751
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,630
I keep the real

752
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:48,630
marriage certificate well.

753
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,840
You are so clever.

754
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,870
Let me accompany you to finish the play.

755
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,080
But you're pregnant,

756
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,840
so I'll do all the heavy work.

757
00:34:58,910 --> 00:34:59,910
Let's exchange.

758
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,600
No problem.

759
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,910
In that case,

760
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:05,520
let me show you how good I am to you.

761
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,760
Qin Shangcheng.

762
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,600
What are you doing?

763
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:16,360
do what we

764
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,390
used to love best.

765
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:20,520
Qin Shangcheng.

766
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,360
I will divorce you.

767
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,320
Bai is missing.

768
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:36,040
Such a big thing happened to Rong and Cheng.

769
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,120
How dare you not tell me?

770
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:42,040
If I hadn't come back early after praying in the temple,

771
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,470
how long would you want to hide it from me?

772
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,120
Mother.

773
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:50,190
If you know, it will only add to your troubles.

774
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,760
I did it for your sake.

775
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,430
For my sake?

776
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,000
I think you don't care about the children at all

777
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:00,000
after you became the emperor.

778
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,710
I've been sending someone to look for Bai.

779
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,430
You must be very tired just back.

780
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:07,910
For your health,

781
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:09,190
you'd better go to bed early.

782
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,560
The trilateral peace talks are just around the corner

783
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,870
and there are many important matters,

784
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:15,870
so

785
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:17,910
I'll excuse myself first.

786
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:36,000
Qian.

787
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,470
Isn't Her Highness going too far this time?

788
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:39,320
That's ok.

789
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,670
She tore up a fake marriage certificate

790
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,950
with our handprints.

791
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:43,390
Fake marriage certificate?

792
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:45,870
So you suddenly asked me to make a fingerprint.

793
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:49,800
Your Highness.

794
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,040
Are you all right?

795
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:59,360
Let me report to you, Your Highness.

796
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,470
The empress dowager suddenly became seriously ill,

797
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:02,430
so she urgently called you and Miss Hua Rong to see her.

798
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:32,280
Are you all right?

799
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:33,670
I'm fine.

800
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:35,520
I'm not used to it for the first time.

801
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,430
What are you doing?

802
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:38,360
threw this crutch away.

803
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,600
I will be your leg.

804
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:42,670
You want to cut off your leg

805
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:44,000
and connect it to me?

806
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:45,280
No need.

807
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,120
Your legs are too short

808
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,080
for me.

809
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,470
Your legs are short!

810
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:50,430
I have my own plan.

811
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,670
What?

812
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,800
This is your plan?

813
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,150
You sure we can walk?

814
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,320
Don't worry.

815
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:02,800
As long as we cooperate well,

816
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,840
we can.

817
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,080
Take my command.

818
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:06,360
You take the right leg, I take the left leg.

819
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:07,470
I take the right leg, you take the left leg.

820
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:08,800
Get ready.

821
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,190
Go.

822
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,670
One, two.

823
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,670
One, two.

824
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:12,870
One, two.

825
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:13,950
One, two.

826
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,280
One, two.

827
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,360
How is it?

828
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:18,080
Is my plan okay?

829
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,470
Not bad.

830
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,670
One, two.

831
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:23,710
One, two.

832
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:28,870
Speed up.
