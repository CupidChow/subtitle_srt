Dad

Dad

Dad

Dad

Dad

Dad

10
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,320
Dad

11
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,240
Are you hurt?

12
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,550
Say a word please.

13
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,240
I'm Rong.

14
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,910
Wake up,

15
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:29,520
dad!

16
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,110
Where does it hurt?

17
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:31,829
Dad,

18
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,750
dad, what happened?

19
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:52,360
My lady,

20
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,030
General Hua will be buried tomorrow.

21
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,270
His belongs are all sorted out.

22
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,079
Would you like to have a look?

23
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,670
Rong has been kneeling in the mourning hall

24
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:14,630
for three days and nights

25
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:15,830
without eating or drinking anything.

26
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,520
She would break down.

27
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:22,550
Wondering what happened to my Lord

28
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,390
and Duanmu Qingcang.

29
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:27,800
Even Duanmu Bai

30
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,000
has been seriously injured,

31
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,270
I don't think

32
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:32,240
Lord is better than him.

33
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,960
All bad news?

34
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:40,880
Maybe worse is yet to come.

35
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,470
Where are you going?

36
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,190
Go pick up a bottle of wine.

37
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,440
Dad,

38
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,320
after Daodao is born,

39
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,270
I will give him a toy

40
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,720
you made by yourself

41
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,159
on each of his birthdays.

42
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,000
I'll tell him that

43
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,480
grandpa gave it to him.

44
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,920
You must let him have a look at

45
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:55,920
the results

46
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,640
of his grandfather's a night's effort.

47
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,880
All the toys in this room

48
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,920
are made by myself.

49
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,040
But

50
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,640
we don't know whether it's a boy or a girl.

51
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,880
We should come up with a name

52
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,040
for both boy and girl.

53
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,880
Qin Xiumu,

54
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,510
Qin Jiuying,

55
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,510
which name do you prefer?

56
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,510
No, no, no,

57
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:26,640
bad news!

58
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,000
South Desolation army attacked Tianlu City.

59
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,720
You are such a doomsayer.

60
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,160
Come on,

61
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,230
go to find her Highness.

62
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,270
Go

63
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:35,760
quickly.

64
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,550
Over there.

65
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:39,320
Your Royal Highness,

66
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,830
where's General Hua Jr.?

67
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,440
Why are you looking for Rong?

68
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:43,920
Look around.

69
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:44,950
Yeah.

70
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,040
Shut up.

71
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:47,950
Qin got General Hua killed.

72
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,480
I haven't held you accountable yet.

73
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,110
Well

74
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,270
are you serious?

75
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,000
Without any proof,

76
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,270
based on a few words from the jailer,

77
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,790
are you out of your mind?

78
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,600
All the evidence are certain,

79
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,270
and you're still making excuses.

80
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,270
Old fossil.

81
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,350
You shut up!

82
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:01,950
General Yan,

83
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,270
why are you looking for Rong

84
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,510
instead of guarding the city gate?

85
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:06,040
Your Royal Highness,

86
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:07,830
General Hua has gone.

87
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,110
Without a leader,

88
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,880
the morale of the soldiers is low.

89
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,760
I'm here to invite General Hua Jr.

90
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,720
to preside over the overall situation.

91
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:16,830
No need to do that.

92
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:21,480
General Hua Jr.,

93
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,390
you've come just in time.

94
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,070
Come with me to the city gate.

95
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,480
With you in charge,

96
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:25,880
the morale and spirit of the soldiers

97
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,160
will be boosted.

98
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,920
I said no need to do that.

99
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,350
South Desolation will soon retreat.

100
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,440
Why do you say this?

101
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:36,880
Rong, do you

102
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,150
have a good idea to deal with it?

103
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:40,030
Not me,

104
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,280
it's my dad.

105
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,030
Dad had already expected today's situation

106
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:47,400
and the Emperor agreed to my dad's plan

107
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,840
to relieve the state of Zhao by besieging the state of Wei.

108
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:50,230
Now Yue Feng

109
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,080
has been appointed as an envoy to Wanjiang.

110
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,840
This is Yue Feng's reply to my father.

111
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:54,840
With your permission!

112
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,150
General Yan,

113
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,640
South Desolation army start retreating

114
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,400
for unknown reasons.

115
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,400
Great,

116
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,080
That's great!

117
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,470
What do you think?

118
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:20,230
Your Majesty,

119
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,030
the army of Wanjiang

120
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,790
has left for the northern of South Desolation, Luocheng.

121
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,280
Our troops are concentrated on the eastern front line.

122
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:28,030
If we continue to attack Tianlu City,

123
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:29,710
we will be attacked from both sides.

124
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:30,840
Your Majesty,

125
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,400
although our army besieged Tianlu City,

126
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,590
Tianlu City is hard to conquer.

127
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,150
It will take at least half a month

128
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,110
to break Tianlu City.

129
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,110
I'm afraid

130
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,760
it's too late to

131
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,200
mobilize the army to withdraw to Luocheng.

132
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,030
Now we have

133
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,080
only one choice left.

134
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,910
Three countries hold peace talks together.

135
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,910
Brilliant to relieve the state of Zhao by besieging the state of Wei.

136
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,440
How cunning Hua Mantian is.

137
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,200
Transmit my order:

138
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,710
Withdraw troops and start peace talks.

139
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:09,110
Yes.

140
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:29,910
Your Highness,

141
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,230
I'm back.

142
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,550
Did you find the miracle-working doctor?

143
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,470
Yes.

144
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,840
I'm the miracle-working doctor.

145
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,350
Minister,

146
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,590
how are you?

147
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,710
Isn't there anyone more reliable?

148
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,230
Your Highness,

149
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:46,710
it's an emergency.

150
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:47,960
I followed the principle of proximity

151
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,760
and searched in Hai City.

152
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,640
I happened

153
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,640
to see Hua Sanlang selling books in Hai City

154
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,000
and then I brought him over.

155
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:53,880
Did I order you stay in

156
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,880
Imperial Alliance?

157
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,230
Why bluff and cheat again?

158
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:56,840
Well,

159
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,200
you've wronged me.

160
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,910
Recently, the treasury of Imperial Alliance is in urgent need.

161
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:01,960
I also

162
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,790
do my bit

163
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:04,840
for the revival of Imperial Alliance.

164
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,230
Cut your crap

165
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:05,910
don't talk nonsense.

166
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,840
Hurry to cure my future husband.

167
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:08,670
Go.

168
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:09,200
Got it.

169
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,150
How's it going?

170
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,520
Mr. Duanmu's pulse is weak

171
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,200
and I'm afraid he won't live long.

172
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,520
If you can't cure him,

173
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,400
I'll kill you.

174
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:29,760
But

175
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,550
He was lucky enough to meet me.

176
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:44,280
Stop it

177
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:44,910
don't walk back and forth.

178
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,550
Do you have any grace of a pirate?

179
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,000
Your Highness,

180
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,640
this is the fifth cup of tea.

181
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,840
I don't think

182
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,080
you're calm.

183
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,640
I mean

184
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,640
It has been two hours.

185
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,200
So far, nothing has happened.

186
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:02,030
He's probably a quack, isn't he?

187
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,910
Meng,

188
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,790
I didn't earn my reputation

189
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,520
for nothing.

190
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:14,880
What the hell is going on?

191
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,320
Don't worry, Minister.

192
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:22,710
After

193
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:25,590
my hard work,

194
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,880
his life

195
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,320
is saved.

196
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:29,880
But he lost too much blood

197
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,470
and needed a few days of recovery

198
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:32,400
to wake up.

199
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:36,550
But...

200
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,320
Speak up!

201
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:43,760
His leg was punctured by hidden weapons

202
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,230
and the Jing in his leg was fractured.

203
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,440
Although I have connected it for him,

204
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,280
I'm afraid

205
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,910
it's hard for him

206
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:52,350
to stand up in the future.

207
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,670
There may be a miracle.

208
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,350
Don't forget that

209
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,960
there are many magic medical codes

210
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,110
in the secret chamber of our Imperial Alliance.

211
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:03,440
Maybe we can find a way

212
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:04,400
to cure

213
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,350
his handicapped leg.

214
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,640
Then why are you waiting for?

215
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,350
Go quickly!

216
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,470
Don't worry, Minister.

217
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:10,590
I'm on it right away.

218
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,000
Dad,

219
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,790
I buried you with my mother.

220
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:35,840
You said

221
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,550
you wanted to be with my mother.

222
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,200
Now you can finally have a reunion.

223
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,150
Thanks to you,

224
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,670
we turned war into trilateral peace talks.

225
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:49,760
Tomorrow

226
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,470
I will lead the Tianchu mission

227
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,550
to South Desolation.

228
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,030
Please be rest assured that

229
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,200
I will take good care of your grandson

230
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,230
and inherit your will to protect Tianchu.

231
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,320
Dad, I hope

232
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,440
you will bless

233
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,280
my trip to South Desolation,

234
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,710
and bless Tianchu for peace from generation to generation.

235
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:08,880
Also,

236
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,030
I will find out the cause of your death

237
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:12,710
and punish the murderer.

238
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,440
Qian,

239
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,880
do you take my candied fruit with you?

240
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:35,880
Your highness, do you mean the golden kumquat?

241
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,590
You know me best!

242
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,670
Of course.

243
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:39,670
The car is fully loaded.

244
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:45,150
Zhang,

245
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,470
do you think the princess

246
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:47,470
has changed her attitude to me this time?

247
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:49,760
Maybe

248
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:50,790
Listen up

249
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:51,960
I analyzed it carefully.

250
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,520
It's all

251
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,880
because of my toothache.

252
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,520
Because of my toothache,

253
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,320
I talked less

254
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,320
and suddenly looked melancholy.

255
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,760
So I decided to

256
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,280
turn into a melancholy prince

257
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,400
and impress the princess in one fell swoop.

258
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,110
Good luck!

259
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,030
You're boring.

260
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:11,760
Your Highness,

261
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:13,230
everything is set.

262
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:13,960
We can go now.

263
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,030
What about Chi Hong?

264
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,400
Any news?

265
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,200
It's getting late.

266
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,440
Let's move.

267
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,320
Crab.

268
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,550
Hong.

269
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,590
What on earth stop you

270
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:33,790
from visiting me?

271
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,110
Don't talk about me.

272
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,200
You've been gone for so long

273
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,280
without any letters.

274
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,400
How is Duanmu Bai?

275
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,110
His life is saved

276
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:42,400
but his legs

277
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,550
may never stand up.

278
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,590
He is still in a coma.

279
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,550
I hope he won't be depressed.

280
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,550
Nothing to worry

281
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,640
I have many ways

282
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,550
to help him stand up.

283
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:52,840
But you...

284
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:55,000
if come across any emergencies in South Desolation,

285
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,150
you should send a message to me

286
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,760
and I'll give you a hand.

287
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:58,840
OK,

288
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,520
it's a deal.

289
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,790
You won't go to South Desolation

290
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,000
to avenge Qin Shangcheng, will you?

291
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,280
Qin Shangcheng would never kill my father.

292
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,640
Even if the whole world says so,

293
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,110
I will stand firmly

294
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:13,910
on his side.

295
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,840
I have faith in you.

296
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:42,760
Anybody?

297
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,230
Prince, you finally woke up.

298
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,080
Who are you?

299
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,790
Fuqin, captain of Shadow Guard.

300
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,080
By his Majesty's orders,

301
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,110
I take care of you here.

302
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:57,670
Did you save my life?

303
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,840
How long have I been in a coma?

304
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,589
Half a month.

305
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:08,920
Where is

306
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,430
Duanmu Bai?

307
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:13,349
After saving you, I was preparing to save Prince Jing,

308
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,000
when I was blocked by people from Tianchu.

309
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:16,680
Prince Jing

310
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,109
must be in their hands now.

311
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,520
He should be fine.

312
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:23,920
Who the hell are those men in black?

313
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,760
I have them checked out

314
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,560
they're appointed by Kong Lin.

315
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,160
Kong Lin?

316
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:32,470
He's not dead yet?

317
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,880
I don't know it.

318
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,950
How about Tianlu City?

319
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,280
Safe and sound.

320
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,760
Things have changed now.

321
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:45,040
Wanjiang has intervened,

322
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,430
and the three countries are preparing

323
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:47,880
to hold secret peace talks in the capital.

324
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:49,590
His Majesty ordered you

325
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,680
to meet him as soon as you wake up.

326
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:52,000
OK.

327
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,160
Your Majesty,

328
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:57,800
The Prince is here.

329
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,520
Cheng,

330
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:04,110
have you ever heard of the silver pomfret?

331
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,430
With sharp teeth,

332
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,590
this fish has the ability to bite the wire and eat the bait.

333
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,310
Why did you go back on your word?

334
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,230
I spared Zou Yitian's life

335
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,190
despite what he'd done to me.

336
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:20,590
But he

337
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,950
was ungrateful

338
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:24,190
and bit me backwards

339
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,800
by bringing Yi Feichi

340
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,800
back to Tianchu.

341
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:29,350
Who is Yi Feichi?

342
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:33,950
Yi Feichi

343
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:36,000
is the best firearm designer in the world,

344
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,520
and the only one who can manufacture

345
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,470
Shenwei cannon.

346
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,590
This cannon is extremely powerful,

347
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,920
equivalent to thousands of troops.

348
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:45,000
It is a sharp weapon for attacking cities and conquering land.

349
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,230
Whoever get this cannon

350
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:47,230
will conquer the world

351
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,640
as easy as turning hands over.

352
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,800
Tianchu never gives up its ambition.

353
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:52,310
I'm afraid they're delaying time

354
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:54,640
through peace talks.

355
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,800
So I

356
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,920
have to take the initiative with me.

357
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,430
So where is he now?

358
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:03,470
Zou Yitian

359
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,950
will sacrifice his live for him.

360
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:06,350
But I can guarantee that

361
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,640
even if he has great ability,

362
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,920
I would not let him leave the capital.

363
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:15,680
Do you want me

364
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,110
to find Yi Feichi for you?

365
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,350
Not for me,

366
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,760
it's for the people in the South Desolation

367
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,640
and your

368
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,590
own country.

369
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,920
I never admitted that I was from South Desolation.

370
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:32,470
And

371
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:33,920
Yi

372
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,190
seems to be the last name of Tianchu.

373
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,430
Yi Feichi

374
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,110
should be from Tianchu.

375
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:47,040
Cheng,

376
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,110
don't forget

377
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,710
what you have

378
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:51,470
is the blood of Duanmu family of South Desolation.

379
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:53,400
Like fish,

380
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,640
a person is doomed to their fate

381
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:56,640
at birth.

382
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:05,920
You killed Hua Mantian,

383
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:07,520
so it's impossible for Tianchu to forgive you.

384
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:09,920
Hua Rong

385
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,040
won't forgive you, either.

386
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,680
Then why don't you come back with me

387
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,040
to unify the world?

388
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:21,000
I, Qin Shangcheng, am just a pirate,

389
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:23,040
not interested in

390
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,190
your great plan.

391
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,830
Neither Tianchu nor South Desolation

392
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:27,190
has nothing to do with me.

393
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:28,310
I come over

394
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,710
to say goodbye to you.

395
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,640
I will leave for the island tomorrow.

396
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:36,950
Wait.

397
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:41,950
On the occasion of trilateral peace talks,

398
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,280
messengers of Tianchu and Wanjiang

399
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,310
will come to the capital in a few days.

400
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:49,710
Hua Rong

401
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,310
is bound to come.

402
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:54,800
All kinds of spies will gather in the capital.

403
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:57,070
The news of Yi Feichi's disappearance

404
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,830
will soon spread.

405
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:00,880
Tianchu and Wanjiang

406
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:03,070
will never give up this opportunity to take the drawing.

407
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:03,760
But I

408
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,430
won't let the drawing of cannon

409
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:07,110
fall into the hands of other countries.

410
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:13,830
Cheng,

411
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,710
I don't want to become enemies with my grandson's mother.

412
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:18,920
So I give you the chance

413
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,640
to get the drawing of cannon.

414
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,400
Don't you understand

415
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,310
my consideration?

416
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,920
Before the trilateral peace talks,

417
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:36,880
I will make sure you get the drawing of cannon.

418
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,110
Your Majesty,

419
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,800
don't you worry that

420
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,070
the prince will get the drawing of cannon and give it to Tianchu?

421
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:55,800
You don't understand.

422
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,310
Qin Shangcheng is a good bait.

423
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:01,680
It would be a pity

424
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,000
not to use him.

425
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,190
But

426
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:08,190
you have to be the one

427
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,710
who draw in the net.

428
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:11,950
Got it.

429
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,400
Four months later,

430
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,800
we returned to Liuyun Pavilion.

431
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:29,280
Last time we came in the mission of royal intermarriage,

432
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,310
and this time we are the mission of peace talks.

433
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,350
Everything here

434
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,400
hasn't changed.

435
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:36,880
As saying goes,

436
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,920
flowers look the same year after year

437
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,640
while person is different year by year.

438
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:47,880
Your Highness,

439
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:49,310
I'm sorry

440
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,680
I'm not implying

441
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,590
Your Highness,

442
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:53,520
your Highness,

443
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,280
bad news.

444
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:55,520
I just got the news.

445
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,070
Duanmu Qingcang

446
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,040
officially issued an imperial edict

447
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,590
to make Qin

448
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,310
the crown prince of South Desolation.

449
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,710
The crown prince?

450
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,040
Don't worry, your Highness.

451
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:10,520
My Lord must have done it on purpose

452
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,470
to lurk beside Duanmu Qingcang

453
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:13,590
and plan something.

454
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:13,830
Yes,

455
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:14,310
That's right!

456
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,830
Qin must be trying to

457
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:16,880
deal with him,

458
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,710
and then replace him.

459
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:20,830
Isn't Qin making it clear that

460
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:22,190
he wants to be the enemy of Rong?

461
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,880
As a loyal follower of Yun Hua Couple,

462
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,070
if Qin dares to

463
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,190
betray Rong,

464
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:28,520
I will be the first to punish him.

465
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,920
Qin Shangcheng must

466
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:33,160
have his own

467
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,160
plan and arrangement to do so.

468
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:35,640
The most important thing now

469
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,710
is the trilateral peace talks in half a month.

470
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:39,680
But why did it take so long?

471
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,000
I'm sure

472
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,470
I'll find Qin Shangcheng

473
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:44,520
and ask him face to face.

474
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,160
General Hua Jr.,

475
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,590
a letter was sent from outside

476
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,070
[Invite General Hua Jr. to have a walk]

477
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,190
[in the children's courtyard in the south of the city.]

478
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,560
Are you Jin Tong?

479
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:10,070
Jin Tong is in there.

480
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:11,680
Good boy.

481
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,230
Have it.

482
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:12,830
Let's go, your Highness.

483
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:14,710
Don't grab

484
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:15,710
there's plenty for everyone.

485
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:17,640
This is for you.

486
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:19,190
This is for you.

487
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:20,800
Don't worry, it's enough.

488
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,880
Mine, mine, this is mine.

489
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,470
Take it

490
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:28,710
I'm Jin Tong of Wanjiang Mission.

491
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:29,350
Rong,

492
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,430
your royal Highness.

493
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:33,110
So you are General Jin of Wanjiang

494
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,880
mentioned in Yue Feng's letter.

495
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,280
General Jin, thank you for relieving the siege of Tianchu.

496
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:38,400
You're welcome, Rong.

497
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:40,070
Jin Yiwen is my cousin.

498
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:41,710
Yue Feng and I feel like old friends at the first meeting.

499
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,000
I've heard many stories about you

500
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,190
from them.

501
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:46,000
We haven't met each other before

502
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,760
but I have known about you a lot.

503
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:48,880
Why did General Jin of Wanjiang

504
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,430
invite us here?

505
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,430
I arrived in the capital two days ago

506
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:53,590
and met these children by chance.

507
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,520
Knowing that they were homeless,

508
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,800
I bought the house

509
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,070
to give them a place to live.

510
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,470
No wonder this place is called children's courtyard.

511
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,230
General Jin, you are so kind.

512
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:06,400
You didn't call us here

513
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,280
to show us your kindness,

514
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,560
did you?

515
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,190
As the head of the peace talks mission,

516
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:12,230
I came for peace.

517
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,400
I hope you can

518
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,760
come in and have a talk with me.

519
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,430
In this way,

520
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:21,830
Duanmu Qingcang set the date for the trilateral peace talks

521
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,070
in half a month

522
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,470
in order to have enough time

523
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:25,640
to find Yi Feichi

524
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,230
and get the drawings of Shenwei cannon.

525
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,430
Duanmu Qingcang is ambitious.

526
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,280
If he gets the drawings,

527
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,680
even if Tianchu allied with Wanjiang,

528
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:34,190
we are by no means the match of South Desolation.

529
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:35,160
So

530
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,430
I begged you

531
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,470
to join hands with me

532
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:38,680
to find Yi Feichi.

533
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,760
General Jin,

534
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,950
if we could find Yi Feichi together,

535
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:44,230
who should own the drawing of cannon?

536
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,880
If we can get it,

537
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,800
it will naturally be one copy for each.

538
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,520
In this way,

539
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,110
it can not only deter South Desolation,

540
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:52,470
but also balance we two.

541
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,310
What do you think?

542
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,520
Thank you for your kindness.

543
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,040
Let me think it over

544
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,880
before I give you an answer.

545
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,160
OK,

546
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:02,760
look forward to your reply.

547
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:06,520
Then let's take our leave.

548
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,000
Rong, your Royal Highness,

549
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,470
See you.

550
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,470
Rong,

551
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:26,430
actually, Jin Tong is pretty good.

552
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:28,000
He is kind, loving

553
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,920
and good-looking.

554
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,110
He was so sincere just now.

555
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:31,830
I thought

556
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:33,430
you would promise to cooperate with him.

557
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,590
Men cannot be judged by their looks.

558
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:38,000
Besides,

559
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,350
he is a young boy.

560
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:42,350
Does he have the charm of a mature man?

561
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,350
You're not better.

562
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,000
Will a mature man

563
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:48,070
hold his forehead with three fingers

564
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:49,190
and look up at the sky?

565
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:51,710
Your Highness,

566
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:54,070
do you think

567
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,000
there's something wrong with Jin Tong?

568
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,350
No,

569
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,280
he is the cousin of Jin Yiwen

570
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,710
and the representative of Wanjiang Mission.

571
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,160
Sensibilities and rationality,

572
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,400
we should cooperate with him.

573
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,190
But the drawing of cannon is significant.

574
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,230
I don't want to hand over the fate of Tianchu

575
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:09,000
to someone we meet for the first time.

576
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,680
Rong, you're so considerate.

577
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,230
You're indeed a great general.

578
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,000
What are you going to do next?

579
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:19,350
I'll go to Qin Shangcheng alone tonight.

580
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:32,640
Your Highness,

581
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:33,830
this is the room

582
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:35,040
where Yi Feichi was held before.

583
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,040
I've searched all corners of the room

584
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,400
with the shadow guard for several times.

585
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,680
There is no clue.

586
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:40,590
If you could find out it,

587
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,280
I shouldn't be here.

588
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,470
Eager to learn

589
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:48,350
from you.

590
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,800
You said Yi Feichi's left leg was lame

591
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:02,470
and was injured

592
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:03,280
while escaping, right?

593
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:04,830
That's right.

594
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,070
Find me a map.

595
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,310
Send people

596
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,830
to search these temples,

597
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,710
and focus on this one.

598
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,350
Why?

599
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,640
When people are vulnerable and helpless,

600
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,070
they will unconsciously look for

601
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:26,400
a place where they have a sense of security

602
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,280
and shelter.

603
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,520
Yi Feichi believes in Buddhism.

604
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,070
Buddhist temple is his psychological safety residence.

605
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:34,680
In addition, it is inconvenient for him

606
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,760
to bandage his legs and feet when he is injured.

607
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:37,110
So he would naturally seek

608
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,560
the nearest place to the clinic.

609
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:40,230
And this temple

610
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,880
is closest to the clinic.

611
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,350
Got it.

612
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,950
I'll send shadow guards to do it now.

613
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:07,760
Rong!

614
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,520
Duanmu Bai,

615
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,470
you finally wake up.

616
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,310
As expected, Hua Sanlang

617
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:52,040
has some real talent.

618
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,000
It hurts.

619
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:54,680
I'm sorry.

620
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:57,190
Your leg injury hasn't healed yet.

621
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:58,560
Why are you in such a hurry to get out of bed?

622
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,070
How long have I been in a coma?

623
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,160
More than half a month.

624
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:08,400
Where is Hua Rong?

625
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,640
You just woke up

626
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,160
and look for Crab,

627
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,350
instead of me

628
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:12,710
who saved your ass.

629
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:13,560
No,

630
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,190
I have something important to tell her,

631
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,160
about General Hua and Qin.

632
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:41,190
Qin Shangcheng,

633
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:45,710
as soon as I ring the bell,

634
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:47,230
you'll show up.

635
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,160
I'm happy it hasn't changed.

636
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:54,350
So you didn't kill my father,

637
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:56,310
did you?

638
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:00,310
Qin Shangcheng,

639
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,680
as long as you say no,

640
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:02,710
I'll believe you.

641
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,640
Speak!

642
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:18,000
I'm sorry.

643
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,230
Why?

644
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,000
It was an accident.

645
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,710
I just wanted to leave.

646
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:35,950
Your father had expected that

647
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:37,470
my father would ask someone to break the prison.

648
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,470
He came to stop it.

649
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:39,560
I didn't mean to.

650
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,160
Rong.

651
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,430
What?

652
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,160
General Hua committed suicide.

653
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,280
Are you sure?

654
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,110
I saw it with my own eyes.

655
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:51,920
At that time,

656
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:54,070
I went to the prison to save Qin.

657
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,190
All the jailers have fainted.

658
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:58,110
And then I saw

659
00:32:59,040 --> 00:32:59,800
General Hua

660
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:01,470
stabbed himself in the chest

661
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:02,920
with the Eight Treasures Kirin Dagger

662
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,230
in front of Qin.

663
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:06,950
But why did

664
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:08,950
an escaped jailer deceive Yan Qing that

665
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:10,070
Qin Shangcheng killed him?

666
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,190
Hurry

667
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,230
I have to hurry and send a message to Crab.

668
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:14,830
Never,

669
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,110
Don't.

670
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:17,950
I think

671
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,640
General Hua and Qin

672
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:21,920
must have reached some consensus.

673
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,560
Now Hua Rong

674
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,950
is in the capital of South Desolation.

675
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,230
If we deliver the letter rashly

676
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:28,280
and hijacked,

677
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,230
General Hua's efforts

678
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:33,040
will be in vain.

679
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,160
Do you want to see them

680
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:36,190
become enemies

681
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:37,110
and fight against each other?

682
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,590
I believe Qin can handle it.

683
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,710
Their relationship

684
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,110
is stronger than anything

685
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:47,520
in the world.

686
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:53,560
Don't touch me.

687
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:56,680
Rong,

688
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,040
I know you can't forgive me.

689
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,160
But no matter what,

690
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:04,520
please take good care of yourself and the fetus in your belly.

691
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,520
Qin Shangcheng,

692
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,800
if what you said is true,

693
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,280
I can only kill you

694
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,710
to avenge my father.

695
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,080
I deserve it.

696
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:19,429
Do it

697
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:34,080
Qin Shangcheng,

698
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,040
you are the father of my baby.

699
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,520
I admit

700
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,000
I couldn't kill you myself.

701
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,080
But from now on,

702
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,280
you and I break up.

703
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,230
Take back your boomerang.

704
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:46,840
Our days are like it,

705
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:48,320
no turning back.

706
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:52,000
Rong,

707
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:00,080
the compass is yours.

708
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,000
Take it back.

709
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:29,150
Ever since you and he became sworn brothers,

710
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:30,600
your relationship with Qin Shangcheng

711
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:32,150
really eased a lot.

712
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:34,950
Do you still go back to the South Desolation?

713
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,230
Can I go back like this?

714
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:41,520
I didn't give up on you.

715
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,670
Why did you give up on yourself?

716
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:44,710
I can save your life,

717
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:45,840
and I'll try my best to cure your leg.

718
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:49,950
Anyway

719
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,390
I don't want to

720
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:54,470
get involved in these disputes anymore.

721
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,390
Happy to hear that.

722
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,670
The position of the Minister of Imperial Alliance

723
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:00,670
is still reserved for you.

724
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:23,800
Rong,

725
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,230
did you see Qin last night?

726
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:32,560
Alas and alack,

727
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,080
Qin even returned the token of love

728
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,190
back to her.

729
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,760
This was indeed returned to me by Qin Shangcheng.

730
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,430
But last night

731
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:45,430
he emphasized the word "belly".

732
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:48,800
Please take good care of yourself and the fetus in your belly.

733
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:51,670
There must be something.

734
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:13,150
It's my dad's handwriting.

735
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,280
[Rong,]

736
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:24,000
[when you read this letter,]

737
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,000
[I'm no longer alive.]

738
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,630
[Don't blame Cheng,]

739
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,040
[because he didn't kill me.]

740
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,280
Dad, what are you...

741
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,190
Cheng,

742
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,390
there's still time.

743
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:48,840
Let's sit down and talk.

744
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:00,560
Cheng,

745
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,430
do you blame me

746
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:04,630
for keeping you in this dungeon?

747
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:05,840
You have your reason

748
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,950
to do so.

749
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,320
Cheng,

750
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,120
half a year ago,

751
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:14,040
I fought with South Desolation

752
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:16,950
and was injured by the dark arrow of the Lieutenant General .

753
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,520
Although the doctor tried his best,

754
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,280
I was not completely cured.

755
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:22,430
I wanted to wait

756
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:23,600
until Rong gave birth to the baby,

757
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,600
and then I would go with Rong's mother.

758
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:26,870
But

759
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,120
it didn't work out.

760
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:33,320
I'm afraid

761
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,230
I can't make it until then.

762
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,430
Dad, don't say anything discouraging.

763
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,190
When Duanmu Bai come over,

764
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:41,390
he has excellent medical skills

765
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:42,760
to cure your disease.

766
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:46,710
Cheng,

767
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:51,430
this is the secret report

768
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,430
sent by Zou Yitian

769
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:55,120
two days before his death.

770
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:02,430
[Duanmu Qingcang ate his words,]

771
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:03,670
[and Yi Feichi has been forced]

772
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:05,430
[to draw the drawings of Shenwei cannon.]

773
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,080
Who

774
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,280
is Yi Feichi?

775
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:13,470
He was originally a firearm designer in Tianchu

776
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,520
and spent his whole life studying firearms.

777
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,000
Now

778
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,080
he was caught by Duanmu Qingcang

779
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:21,800
and imprisoned in the capital

780
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,230
to study Shenwei cannon.

781
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,840
Now Zou Yitian

782
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,150
has died,

783
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,150
and the drawing of cannon

784
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:29,360
is likely to

785
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,670
fall into Duanmu Qingcang's hands.

786
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,120
Therefore,

787
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:35,670
we must prevent Duanmu Qingcang

788
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:37,150
from creating Shenwei cannon,

789
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:38,000
otherwise,

790
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:38,840
the whole Tianchu

791
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,710
and even the whole Central Plains

792
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:42,470
will be flattened by the South Desolation.

793
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:44,360
You mean that

794
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,120
you want me to return to Duanmu Qingcang again.

795
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,120
But even if I go back now,

796
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,280
Duanmu Qingcang won't trust me.

797
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:17,760
Dad,

798
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,320
dad.

799
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,230
General Hua...

800
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,280
Cheng,

801
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:27,600
so

802
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,710
I have to create a situation

803
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,910
to convince Duanmu Qingcang

804
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:34,840
that you can only

805
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:37,230
take refuge in him.

806
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:38,430
Dad,

807
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:40,670
dad.

808
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:45,230
Cheng,

809
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,600
I have another letter

810
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:49,760
in my arms

811
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,560
for Rong.

812
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,520
She is pregnant.

813
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,710
My biggest selfishness

814
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
is that I hope this matter

815
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,670
will not involve Rong.

816
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:03,080
OK.

817
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,150
Cheng,

818
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:08,150
give this letter

819
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:11,120
to Rong

820
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,950
at the right time.

821
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:16,520
She'll understand everything.

822
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:17,390
OK.

823
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,000
Cheng,

824
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:25,150
I'll leave my dear Rong

825
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,520
to you.

826
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:29,630
OK,

827
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:34,190
dad,

828
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:39,360
dad,

829
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:40,950
dad,

830
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,120
dad.

831
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:53,760
Rong,

832
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:55,150
Rong.

833
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:05,520
Your Highness,

834
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,230
what are you going to do

835
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:08,040
with Qin

836
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,000
next?

837
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:14,360
Qin Shangcheng

838
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,670
is now under special surveillance.

839
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,910
So I will continue to pretend to oppose him

840
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,280
and help him win Duanmu Qingcang's trust.

841
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:22,910
Wait until he gets the drawing of cannon

842
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:23,910
and send it back to Tianchu.

843
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,470
I will never let the drawing

844
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,360
fall into the hands of Duanmu Qingcang.

845
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,040
Rong, don't worry.

846
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,040
I will help you and Qin

847
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,470
get rid of this painful situation as soon as possible.

848
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:55,910
Come on.

849
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,190
General Hua,

850
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:05,800
I was convinced that

851
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,430
I lost the battle of Tianlu Mountain.

852
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:10,670
Once the truce agreement is issued,

853
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:12,560
it can ensure the stability

854
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,120
of South Desolation and Tianchu people for ten years.

855
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:16,230
Also,

856
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:19,520
my son will be taken care of

857
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:20,670
by General Hua in Tianchu.

858
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:22,760
Prince Mu is too modest.

859
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,910
I just occupy the right time and place.

860
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:28,520
It's invincible.

861
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,150
It's enough for me

862
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:35,080
to have an opponent like you

863
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,390
in my

864
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:37,600
military life.

865
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:38,710
Come on, my pleasure.

866
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:39,360
Come on.

867
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,150
Cheers!

868
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:40,670
Cheers!

869
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:46,040
Prince Mu,

870
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:48,670
if you and I weren't in different positions,

871
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:50,150
and worked for different masters,

872
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,390
I don't want to be the enemy of you.

873
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:55,910
Aren't we happy

874
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,560
to drink and have fun?

875
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:59,000
Yeah.

876
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:02,470
I heard that general Hua has a daughter,

877
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:03,840
who is a born beauty,

878
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:04,670
and stands gracefully.

879
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:06,670
Although my son is not talented,

880
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:08,470
he is both civil and military.

881
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:11,280
If we didn't belong to two countries,

882
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,190
wouldn't it be happy

883
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:14,870
to become in laws?

884
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:19,150
Who can predict the future?

885
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:22,120
Maybe the wine in our cup

886
00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:24,190
will be a wedding wine in the future.

887
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:26,040
That makes sense.

888
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:26,560
Come on.

889
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:26,950
Cheers!

890
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:28,320
Come on, come on.
