[The Romance of Hua Rong 2]
[EP06]

3
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:43,870
It's too sweet.

4
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,270
I like it.

5
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:11,800
Rong

6
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:13,550
This

7
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,360
is the lucky pastry I bought for you
from Fan Building.

8
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,750
It is said that

9
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,880
a bite for each spouse

10
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,600
means a long and successful marriage.

11
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,030
Why are you giving me your leftovers?

12
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:27,880
I won't eat it.

13
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,110
I'm kidding.

14
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:33,470
I wouldn't mind eating your leftovers.

15
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,079
Yummy.

16
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:39,390
Rong

17
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,360
Don't eat too full.

18
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,750
We'll have something better later.

19
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,630
There will be more?

20
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,160
Qin Shangcheng

21
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,800
Are you trying to fatten me up
and break up with me？

22
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:49,800
Of course not.

23
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,240
I've been pissing you off lately,

24
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,960
and you've lost weight,

25
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,360
so I'm making it up to you.

26
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:56,800
I don't care.

27
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:58,800
I'm not gonna eat anything from now on, anyway.

28
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,030
It said that

29
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,960
the best dish in Hai City

30
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,750
is the sleeping fish soup.

31
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,240
Those who don't eat it

32
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,360
will regret.

33
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:14,080
Okay, I'll just have a small bowl.

34
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:15,750
I'll take you there.

35
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:17,190
Let's go.

36
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,520
I get it, Qin Shangcheng.

37
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,240
No wonder you know the place so well,

38
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,630
even the special snacks,

39
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,240
'cause your foster father is the chief of Hai City

40
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,160
and this is your hometown.

41
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,320
I take you here

42
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,800
to show you

43
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,360
the place where I grew up.

44
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,240
When I was a child,

45
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,800
my father would bring my mother and me

46
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,880
some sleeping fish soup

47
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,000
whenever he returned from a sea trip.

48
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,630
Over time,

49
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,440
the sleeping fish soup

50
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,750
has become a taste of my hometown in my memory.

51
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,160
This is your home when you are a kid.

52
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,550
Yeah.

53
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:10,910
After all these years

54
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,080
the yard is still the same.

55
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,350
Since we left Hai City,

56
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:19,880
it has been uninhabited.

57
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,600
Why did you leave?

58
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:28,790
After my foster mother's death,

59
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:31,440
the Black Dragon Gang found my father's trace.

60
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,550
Luckily, my father got the news first

61
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,320
and took me away

62
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:38,880
before they arrived.

63
00:04:58,670 --> 00:04:59,670
When I was a child,

64
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,480
my foster father taught me swordplay here,

65
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:08,070
but we left in such a hurry

66
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,950
that we didn't take anything with us.

67
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:14,830
Don't worry.

68
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:15,550
I'll be with you

69
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,440
to bring back all your childhood memories.

70
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:19,670
Okay.

71
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,390
Look.

72
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,720
These were my treasures as a child.

73
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,320
I can't believe the King Pirate

74
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,760
has such a cute side.

75
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,480
Listen to this,

76
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,230
you can hear the sound of the sea in it.

77
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,110
It's true.

78
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,270
Amazing.

79
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,720
Number Riddles.

80
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,070
In this book

81
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,760
each number

82
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,159
has a corresponding word.

83
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,200
As a child,

84
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,640
I used to use these numbers

85
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,000
to communicate with my friends in code.

86
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,480
For example, four and five

87
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,230
means it's me.

88
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,320
Then

89
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,110
Five, two and one means

90
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,760
I love you.

91
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,880
Since Number Riddle is so fun,

92
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,920
let's take it away

93
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,760
and use it as our secret code from now on.

94
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,440
Okay.

95
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,550
This compass is for you

96
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:32,550
so that you know where I am.

97
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:34,950
Nonsense.

98
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,070
This compass looks delicate.

99
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,320
Sharp eyes.

100
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:43,950
This compass

101
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,159
and a boomerang come as a pair.

102
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,159
This compass normally looks nothing special,

103
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,950
but it will automatically point to the boomerang

104
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,230
if the boomerang

105
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,230
appears within a mile.

106
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,350
The boomerang of Swordman Yunhe?

107
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,350
This is not a compass.

108
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,760
This is "come to you".

109
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,110
Where's the boomerang?

110
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,670
The boomerang

111
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,040
was accidentally lost

112
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,390
during the search for the Black Dragon Gang.

113
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,320
What a pity.

114
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,640
But don't be sad.

115
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,000
We'll keep this compass on us

116
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,040
at all times from now on,

117
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,670
and maybe we'll even find the boomerang.

118
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,040
I'll take this gift.

119
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:21,830
Okay.

120
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,070
When I was a child,

121
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,159
my foster mother used to tell me that

122
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,320
water was connected to all the seas

123
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,440
and if I poured water on my body,

124
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,320
I could feel

125
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,159
my foster father

126
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,390
who was sailing on the sea, missing us.

127
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,070
So I often played the water-sprinkling game with my foster mother

128
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,000
to kill the time.

129
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:55,720
Really?

130
00:07:59,070 --> 00:07:59,480
Yeah.

131
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,200
You little liar.

132
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:09,150
Play tricks with your husband.

133
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,440
Let me see what move you make next.

134
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,710
and I'll take that.

135
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:21,710
Look.

136
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:23,400
Do I look good?

137
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:24,760
Pretty.

138
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,110
I had no idea that my mother's clothes

139
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:28,760
would fit so well on you.

140
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:31,520
It means I'm as fit as your foster mother.

141
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,200
By the way, Rong

142
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:34,550
today is the middle of the month,

143
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:35,840
and my foster mother once said

144
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,880
if people make a wish on the full moon,

145
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,470
the wish may come true.

146
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,910
Do you want to have a try, Rong?

147
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:40,520
Okay.

148
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:41,400
Let's go.

149
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,670
Foster father and foster mother,

150
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,000
hope you

151
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,230
can bless Qin Shangcheng and me

152
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:58,710
as husband and wife,

153
00:09:58,710 --> 00:09:59,710
never to be separated.

154
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,520
Rong, what did you wish for just now?

155
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,470
I can't say.

156
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:11,710
It doesn't come true if I say it.

157
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,000
Let me guess.

158
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,470
Did you wish that

159
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,550
you will be with me forever

160
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,470
and give me a warm home?

161
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,840
It was his own guess,

162
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,110
it had nothing to do with me.

163
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:25,080
Foster father and foster mother,

164
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,280
please make it come true.

165
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,790
A waste of a good look.

166
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,030
Well.

167
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:40,150
Such grand courtesy for a first meeting.

168
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,230
But the courtesy

169
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,880
is proper for us.

170
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,520
Help me up now!

171
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:52,790
I don't want to hurt innocent people.

172
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:53,670
You

173
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:54,590
can stay there.

174
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:55,110
You

175
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,400
come and get killed!

176
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,200
Kill me?

177
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:01,320
You guys?

178
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:04,670
No one has ever dared to speak to me like this.

179
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:07,230
I am the number one master in Jingcheng.

180
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:08,880
I'll beat you to your knees
and beg for mercy in a moment.

181
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:09,960
Face your fate.

182
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,400
Get away!

183
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,840
How dare you kick me!

184
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,790
Sixth Princess!

185
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,840
You are the King Pirate, Qin Shangcheng,

186
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,200
who tore up the imperial edict
and proposed the imparity clause

187
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,080
to my father.

188
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,470
Is that your reason for assassinating me?

189
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:42,710
You are one of the few men

190
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,550
who have left my father at a loss for words.

191
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,520
I love you more than anything,

192
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,320
so how could I kill you?

193
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,280
So

194
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:54,280
Sixth Princess

195
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,320
did you just play house?

196
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,350
When I followed you,

197
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,030
I saw you were inseparable.

198
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,110
I didn't realize he wasn't your fiancé.

199
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,640
Let me introduce him to you,

200
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,110
he is my nephew.

201
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,710
As his aunt,

202
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:09,080
I watched him grow up,

203
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,030
so our relationship is extremely good.

204
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,350
You are wrong, aunt.

205
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,080
I am a few years older than you.

206
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,470
I watched you grow up.

207
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:20,470
Nothing different.

208
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:21,710
Sixth Princess

209
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:22,840
so

210
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,960
It was Duanmu Bai you wanted to assassinate.

211
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,550
Yeah.

212
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:27,910
It's all because Nie Yu is so stupid,

213
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,550
otherwise, why would I do this?

214
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:31,910
Nie Yu

215
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,550
your fiancé-to-be?

216
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,000
With that emaciated body,

217
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,230
he couldn't even ride a horse,

218
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,280
let alone marry me.

219
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:42,080
The man I love

220
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,200
is a hero

221
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,440
like Qin.

222
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:47,280
One day,

223
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:48,910
he will fly to marry me

224
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:49,790
on a wooden kite.

225
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,590
Damn it.

226
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,910
Qin Shangcheng's woman-attracting body

227
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:58,640
is acting up again.

228
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:01,790
So

229
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:05,000
Sixth Princess, you hope to assassinate Duanmu Bai

230
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,710
to stop the hostage exchange

231
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:08,350
so that you wouldn't have to marry Nie Yu.

232
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,110
Right.

233
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:10,640
But you can't

234
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,080
go to such an extreme.

235
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,230
You are right, Rong.

236
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:19,030
I shouldn't have been too impulsive.

237
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:21,110
But to avoid marrying someone I didn't know well,

238
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:22,790
I had to join the bridal escort

239
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:23,840
before making other plans.

240
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,320
Rong

241
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,400
This is a vital thing in my life.

242
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,640
You will help me, right?

243
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:32,910
Let me see.

244
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:35,960
Wait a minute.

245
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,640
This little girl even wanted to stay,

246
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,590
she must want to stay with Qin Shangcheng.

247
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:45,590
No way!

248
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,150
I must extinguish the first hint

249
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:48,640
of this danger.

250
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,590
When your husband

251
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:04,280
is surrounded by admirers,

252
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:06,000
don't be overly alarmed,

253
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,670
instead show your grace

254
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,230
and act like you don't care.

255
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,640
This is playing hard-to-get.

256
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,910
Rong, please grant my request.

257
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,030
It's okay,

258
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,080
if you want to stay.

259
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,440
But I have two requests.

260
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,350
First,

261
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,470
you must dress as a personal maid

262
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:25,590
and stay by my side at all times.

263
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,550
Second,

264
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:28,110
You can no longer assassinate Duanmu Bai.

265
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:28,790
But

266
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,840
I can make sure you won't marry Nie Yu.

267
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:33,230
Do you agree, Sixth Princess?

268
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:33,760
Yes.

269
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,030
I knew you

270
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:35,910
would love me the most.

271
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:37,470
Then

272
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:38,350
In public,

273
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,550
I serve you as a maid,

274
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,230
but in private,

275
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:41,910
you serve me.

276
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:42,790
Nice try!

277
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:43,760
Change your clothes.

278
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:44,910
Okay.

279
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,840
I will follow your advice.

280
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,790
Go.

281
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,470
Qin,

282
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:54,590
see you tomorrow.

283
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:04,640
Aren't you afraid of getting into trouble

284
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,320
for keeping this spoiled princess around?

285
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:11,960
It doesn’t matter.

286
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,080
The troubles she made

287
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,550
are not as many as Butterfly.

288
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:15,590
It won't affect me.

289
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,030
Hurry up.

290
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:22,670
Zhang, hurry up.

291
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:24,350
You must explain it to Qin later.

292
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:26,150
Why do I always have to explain to him?

293
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:27,960
I'm the one who takes the fall every time.

294
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,400
Wait.

295
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,960
I'm six months older than you
and I'm your second brother.

296
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,150
You said that we should share the blessings

297
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:32,760
and you should take the blame,

298
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,440
have you forgotten?

299
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:36,710
Well, you are right.

300
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:37,150
Right?

301
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:37,790
So

302
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:38,960
what do you think

303
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,520
I should tell Qin?

304
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,080
You can be...

305
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:43,440
My...My...Lord

306
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,910
A...A...A spy

307
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,150
h...has infiltrated here.

308
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:46,640
Believe me.

309
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,790
I'm sure Qin will believe you if you say that.

310
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,470
Qian

311
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:50,790
I don't even believe that,

312
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,520
let alone Qin.

313
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,590
What kind of spy

314
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:56,520
would be able to infiltrate
the heavily guarded Yun Hua Building?

315
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,470
I think this person is suspicious

316
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:03,350
and probably a female spy.

317
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,440
Stop.

318
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,080
Stop.

319
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:09,640
Who are you?

320
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,520
Take off your veil.

321
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,440
It was the moment I met you

322
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,280
that I finally understood

323
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,790
the meaning of love at first sight.

324
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,710
I think I will lose sleep tonight,

325
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,110
but I won't be counting sheep,

326
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,440
I will only miss you.

327
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,880
Who are you, wild boy?

328
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,080
How dare you be rude to a princess.

329
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,590
Princess? What princess?

330
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,790
Do you know this?

331
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:07,640
Your...your...your

332
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,470
Your Highness.

333
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:09,760
I'm

334
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,880
the first counselor

335
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,920
of the King Pirate,

336
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,470
Qian Dayou.

337
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:14,430
I'm also King Pirate's good friend,

338
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:15,160
You Daqian.

339
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:17,920
So am I.

340
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:20,950
So you

341
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:23,310
are Rong and Qin's men.

342
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,710
Today,

343
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,560
I'm in a good mood.

344
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,640
so I'll let you go.

345
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:33,070
Let's go.

346
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,310
Qian!

347
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:38,830
Qian!

348
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:39,470
Are you okay?

349
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,000
Love.

350
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,680
This is love.

351
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,710
You're not even into a girl as good as Zhu.

352
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,560
She...

353
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,070
No.

354
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:58,640
You don't understand.

355
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,310
What I said before

356
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:03,470
is not love.

357
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:06,110
I never found out

358
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,280
what

359
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,310
love at first sight was until today.

360
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,590
Qian.

361
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,470
I am more worried that

362
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,470
you won't be able to carry

363
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,000
this

364
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,190
royal love.

365
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:23,430
You don't understand love.

366
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:23,880
Qian.

367
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,400
Qian.

368
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:25,560
Qian.

369
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,160
We are going to report to Qin.

370
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,110
Yeah.

371
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,070
Go, go, go.

372
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:33,760
Wake up!

373
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,350
You don't understand.

374
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,520
Wake up.

375
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:36,520
My Lord

376
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:36,830
My Lord

377
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:37,350
Here.

378
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:40,880
Go.

379
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:45,800
My Lord

380
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:46,920
A...

381
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,110
Aunt.

382
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,070
This is our uncle-in-law.

383
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,430
My Lord

384
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:56,880
Your Highness

385
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,160
How are things going?

386
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,430
Are you two worried about

387
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,950
me finding out about the thing?

388
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,470
No, no, no.

389
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,520
Well,

390
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,800
the most important thing

391
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,800
between couples

392
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,800
is trust.

393
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,680
So, there must be

394
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,400
no secrets

395
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,350
between you and Qin.

396
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,110
Say it.

397
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,230
Say it.

398
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,280
Say it.

399
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,040
Everything is under our lord's control.

400
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:31,430
Yeah.

401
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:32,640
Everything

402
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,560
is under control.

403
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,430
At the very beginning,

404
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:36,310
we built a fortified point

405
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,350
to lure Duanmu Bai into the trap.

406
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:42,070
But we were robbed by the Qing Hong Gang!

407
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,000
What should we do?

408
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:51,400
Well.

409
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,280
Brothers.

410
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,400
Earlier,

411
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,310
a guy

412
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:56,310
swore to me that

413
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:58,560
this thing would be foolproof.

414
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,070
Now, he has egg on his face.

415
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,110
Why are you talking nonsense here?

416
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,470
You made me say it!

417
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,430
Why do you listen to me?

418
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:07,760
Okay.

419
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,310
The thing has happened.

420
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,190
What should we do next?

421
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:23,760
Rong

422
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,040
I think

423
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:28,520
This treasure chest was lost.

424
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,520
Someone will be more anxious than us.

425
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:43,640
Yeah.

426
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,710
Yeah, yeah.

427
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,310
I've investigated.

428
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,430
Tomorrow they will hold an auction

429
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:59,400
at the Qing Hong Villa.

430
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,160
And the stolen treasure

431
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,070
is in the bidding.

432
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,830
The Qing Hong Gang is too madcap.

433
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,470
Not only did they steal our treasures,

434
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:08,040
but they took them to auction.

435
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:08,880
Exactly.

436
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:10,920
Obviously,

437
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:12,880
their target is not the treasure

438
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,070
but us.

439
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,280
In this case,

440
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,070
we have to go to the Qing Hong Villa.

441
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:21,430
We should find a way to disguise our identities.

442
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,640
About the identities,

443
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,280
my lord has already arranged.

444
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,430
The first pair

445
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,160
are the young master of the Mei Ying Tower,

446
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:28,800
Jian lai

447
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,000
and his sister, Jian Wu.

448
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:30,880
The second pair

449
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,710
are the Death Couple,

450
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:33,560
Xie Lingyuan

451
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:34,400
and Zhao Yang.

452
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:35,920
Wait, wait, wait.

453
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,520
Wait for a minute.

454
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,800
If we ran into them

455
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,280
and they revealed us,

456
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:41,350
wouldn't it be humiliating?

457
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,470
It'll be humiliating.

458
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,400
Dead people won't show up.

459
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:46,950
South Desolation

460
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:48,880
is indeed a murderous and barbaric place.

461
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:49,760
You!

462
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:50,710
What?

463
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,560
These people are evil cultists.

464
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,470
What's wrong with my lord removing evil

465
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:57,070
from the people?

466
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,000
Okay, okay.

467
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,470
Get down to business.

468
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,000
At present,

469
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,160
there's short of a woman.

470
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,230
How about...

471
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:06,590
Ling

472
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:08,760
would like to do you a favor.

473
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:18,590
She is...

474
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:19,950
My new maid,

475
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:20,520
Ling.

476
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:27,880
That's great.

477
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:29,920
Lord

478
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:31,110
and his aunt

479
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,430
can play the couple.

480
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:34,400
Ling and I

481
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,040
can

482
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,000
play the brother and sister.

483
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,190
No, it's improper.

484
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:44,310
My lady is unmarried.

485
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,470
If she and her nephew were to play a couple,

486
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:47,920
it would ruin her reputation.

487
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,560
I

488
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:52,040
would like to bear the blame for my lady

489
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,560
and defend my lady's reputation.

490
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:55,680
Thanks.

491
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,800
What do you think, nephew?

492
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:02,400
Rong's playing hard-to-get to

493
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,710
test my attitude towards the matter

494
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,800
and take the initiative.

495
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,760
I won't let her have her way.

496
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:08,880
As a junior,

497
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:10,160
I have no say in the matter.

498
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,640
Everything is at your disposal.

499
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:17,590
You have a point, Ling.

500
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,590
Heir and I are both from the official.

501
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:21,800
Acting as people from Mei Ying Tower

502
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,760
can't be more proper for us.

503
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:24,040
Proper.

504
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:29,760
Hua Rong

505
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,880
still wants to attract me.

506
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,230
So childish.

507
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,640
Why did this playing hard-to-get

508
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,190
turn out to be ineffective

509
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:48,800
and put me in a difficult position?

510
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:50,560
No sense!

511
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:52,160
There must be something wrong.

512
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:55,830
For playing hard-to-get,

513
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:58,280
the main point is

514
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,280
to be sure of the balance.

515
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,070
Oh no, no, no.

516
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,110
I must have acted too exaggeratedly

517
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:04,950
to make Qin Shangcheng think

518
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:06,430
I didn't care about it.

519
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:10,160
Overdone is worse than undone!

520
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:21,190
I get an idea.

521
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,880
The Qing Hong Gang

522
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,830
is a new force

523
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:27,920
that has emerged in the last two years.

524
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,590
It seems to

525
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:30,710
be a prestigious school,

526
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,470
but behind the scenes,

527
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,040
it is all about killing and smuggling,

528
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,760
and most of those items in this auction

529
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:37,590
are of unknown origin.

530
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:39,830
How dare they

531
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:41,280
do wrong under the nose of the King Pirate.

532
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:41,950
Yeah.

533
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:46,160
As soon as they come over,

534
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:49,000
I'll kill two birds with one stone,

535
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,590
as a honeymoon gift for Rong.

536
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:52,710
Yeah.

537
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,710
Don't worry!

538
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,520
Big Brother hasn't finished.

539
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,520
I know what he wants to say.

540
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,400
Don't worry.

541
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,470
I'm sure I'll arrange it perfectly.

542
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:15,560
Qin Shangcheng

543
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:23,710
What's wrong.

544
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:25,680
A midnight snack for you.

545
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,350
Close the door.

546
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:38,920
Rong, this is...

547
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,640
Sleeping fish soup.

548
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,190
Sleeping fish soup?

549
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:45,560
The old chef has...

550
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:47,880
It's not a problem for your wife.

551
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,800
I ran all over the Hai City

552
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,190
and finally found him in the south of the city.

553
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:52,830
Try it.

554
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:53,830
Is it the same taste as you were a kid?

555
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:14,000
Qin Shangcheng

556
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,760
What's wrong with you?

557
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:22,640
Nothing.

558
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,470
I just feel a little guilty

559
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:26,520
inside.

560
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,070
After all,

561
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,400
I was angry with you before

562
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,760
because of the royal intermarriage.

563
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,040
But you,

564
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:37,040
not only are you not mad at me
for pretending to be a couple with the princess,

565
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,280
but you even brought me soup.

566
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:42,000
You are a good wife.

567
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,070
Drink soup.

568
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:45,520
Okay.

569
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,070
Take gentleness as my weapon.

570
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,590
Pretend I'm a perfect and generous wife.

571
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,760
In fact,

572
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,230
I hide my blade point.

573
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:58,590
Set me up as morally invincible.

574
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:01,070
The fifth trick, a velvet paw,

575
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:02,230
worked.

576
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:04,680
Qin Shangcheng is already feeling guilty.

577
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:07,040
He will definitely offer to change his group.

578
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,400
Honey.

579
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,400
Don't be guilty.

580
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,830
As husband and wife,

581
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:14,950
we should understand each other

582
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:15,920
and trust each other.

583
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,710
As you are so generous,

584
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:20,830
I will

585
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:22,760
never let you suffer again.

586
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,520
I will gather everyone to regroup.

587
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,070
never betray

588
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:27,000
your trust.

589
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,000
Rong

590
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:32,920
What's wrong?

591
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,950
If there is anything wrong, tell me,

592
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,560
and I will listen to you.

593
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,070
Nothing wrong.

594
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:41,350
Everything goes well.

595
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,710
The arrangement now is good.

596
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:46,070
We are a couple.

597
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:47,040
A model couple.

598
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,110
Chu Fengling is just a little girl.

599
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,400
I don't mind it at all.

600
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,520
Have some soup.

601
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:55,040
Qin

602
00:27:59,040 --> 00:27:59,950
Why does she come?

603
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:07,880
Qin

604
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:09,520
Are you asleep, Qin?

605
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,560
I am just about to sleep.

606
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,110
It's good that you are not sleeping.

607
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:25,070
I have something to ask you.

608
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:32,040
Qin

609
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:33,430
I'm troubled by a problem

610
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:34,560
and can't fall asleep.

611
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,710
You have a rich Jianghu experience.
[*The environment where the martial artists live.]

612
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:38,000
I'm sure you can solve my problem.

613
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,520
Well.

614
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,350
What's the problem?

615
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:41,880
Qin

616
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,880
If you like someone,

617
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,950
would you tell her?

618
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,230
I would.

619
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:51,680
Great minds think alike.

620
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,230
Qin

621
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:53,640
Marry me.

622
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,280
You and I have only known

623
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,400
for only a few hours

624
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,000
and you want to

625
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:03,950
marry me?

626
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:05,760
So what?

627
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,350
Duanmu Bai and Rong

628
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:09,230
were engaged before they even met.

629
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,470
That's a different situation.

630
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:11,430
Duanmu Bai and I

631
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:12,830
aren't really getting married.

632
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:18,350
I'm not interested in being your husband.

633
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,400
It's not a big deal.

634
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,520
It makes me feel better

635
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,920
to get it off my chest.

636
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,000
If you don't like me today,

637
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,160
I'll keep trying

638
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:29,230
and maybe you'll like me

639
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,830
after staying with me.

640
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:37,710
Who's there?

641
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:39,950
Mice.

642
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,110
Mice.

643
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:42,880
A group of mice came to my house recently.

644
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,560
They like stealing

645
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,710
vinegar

646
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,590
and sometimes climb into my bed.

647
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:49,230
I'll deal with it

648
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:50,280
when you're gone.

649
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:54,230
Okay.

650
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:55,830
I'll leave you

651
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:56,920
to catch the rats.

652
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:57,950
Goodbye.

653
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,350
Wait.

654
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:11,400
I need your help

655
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,680
on a matter.

656
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:13,760
Okay.

657
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:19,110
No problem.

658
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,110
I also have a thing

659
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,070
to tell you.

660
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,000
You're the first person who dared to kick my butt.

661
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,110
You compare me to a mouse again.

662
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:38,350
Rong

663
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:39,880
Are you angry?

664
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,160
Of course not.

665
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,040
I'm just curious

666
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,710
about what you said to the Princess just now.

667
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:47,830
You'll know that tomorrow.

668
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:56,160
Okay.

669
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:57,880
Have a goodnight, my nephew.

670
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,040
Don't reveal it to your little princess tomorrow.

671
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:02,560
Okay.

672
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:03,880
Remember to close the door

673
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,190
when you leave, my aunt.

674
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,430
Okay.

675
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:22,680
What's wrong?

676
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,590
Qian

677
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:26,280
From my experience of being married for years,

678
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,430
the presence

679
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,310
of this princess

680
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,950
is sure

681
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:32,880
to cause some trouble

682
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:35,230
between Qin and Rong.

683
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:38,800
Zhang

684
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,920
As one of the most charismatic men

685
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,590
behind the Qin,

686
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,070
it was time for me to step up

687
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:46,160
and take this culprit

688
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,160
into my pocket

689
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:48,520
and help out

690
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,430
Qin and Rong.

691
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:51,800
Beware of your plans falling through.

692
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,310
Shut up.

693
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,000
- Just watch and see.
- You...

694
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:55,760
Lord is in the room.

695
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,760
You can't beat me.

696
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,470
My lord,

697
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,950
Hua Rong tried every possible way

698
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:04,560
to team up with you.

699
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,950
You must be careful

700
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,520
not to be confused by her.

701
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:10,070
No way.

702
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:12,280
She's just a mediocre woman,

703
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,760
no better than a millionth of Little White Dove.

704
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:16,190
She wants me to like her.

705
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,950
It's a dream!

706
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,280
You are right, my lord.

707
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:11,110
Auntie, you don't look well.

708
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:13,880
It seems you didn't rest well last night.

709
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,430
No.

710
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:16,230
Thanks to you.

711
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,560
I slept well.

712
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:19,920
Feeling good.

713
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:24,520
Since

714
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,470
gentle methods don't work on you,

715
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,830
I'll have to turn things around

716
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:30,040
in a more ruthless way.

717
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,400
Lai

718
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,160
Why are you eating like a child?

719
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,590
The food is all over your face.

720
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:36,070
Come on.

721
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:37,830
Let me give you a wipe.

722
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,040
Miss Hua

723
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:42,070
Please behave yourself in public.

724
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,800
Okay, wipe it yourself.

725
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:48,680
Rong's using others to piss me off.

726
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:51,000
She's getting bold.

727
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:54,070
Every dog has its day.

728
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,400
Qin

729
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,280
Qin

730
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,430
This is green bean soup.

731
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:04,230
I bought it early in the morning
at the Fan building.

732
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:05,230
It clears heat and detoxifies the body,

733
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:06,520
and eliminates heat and fire.

734
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,190
Try it.

735
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:21,840
Ling

736
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:23,760
Don't forget your identity.

737
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,040
Thank you for reminding me, Rong.

738
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,230
Now,

739
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:29,760
Qin and I are a couple.

740
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,560
I should feed him myself.

741
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:32,429
Come on.

742
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:33,760
Honey,

743
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:34,840
have a try.

744
00:34:42,469 --> 00:34:44,520
My aunt has been irascible lately.

745
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,760
She needs to eliminate fire more than I do.

746
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,429
Thank you, my nephew.

747
00:34:48,429 --> 00:34:48,909
Wu

748
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:50,800
With the grandeur of our Mei Ying Tower,

749
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,320
how can you drink this cheap stuff?

750
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,190
This top-notch diaphoretic pill,

751
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:55,320
the Spring Pill,

752
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,949
is what you should take now.

753
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:58,390
Lai

754
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:00,150
You are so considerate.

755
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:02,670
Lai

756
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,660
Where are you going?

757
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:06,630
Lai

758
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,840
Is everything ready?

759
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:26,710
Don't worry.

760
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:27,470
You see.

761
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:29,950
Everything is here.

762
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,630
Everything in here

763
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:35,360
represents a memory for us.

764
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,600
After ten years,

765
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,760
we can dig it out

766
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,150
and recall the past together.

767
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:40,910
You are so considerate, Rong.

768
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:44,040
But this time box is too small.

769
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,360
The space is limited.

770
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,800
So, I just put in a few important things.

771
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:48,870
How about you?

772
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:50,470
What are you going to put in?

773
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,630
That's all?

774
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:03,120
Just a small porcelain bottle?

775
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:06,080
As what you said,

776
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,320
there are too many memories between us.

777
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,390
We can’t put them all even we dig deep.

778
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:10,150
Hence

779
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:12,560
I put only the seeds of the balloon flower into it.

780
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,840
I know you like balloon flowers.

781
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,870
It also witnesses our marriage.

782
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:21,560
After ten years,

783
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,800
I, you

784
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,360
and our children

785
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:27,520
can take the time box out together.

786
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:28,950
In time, our love

787
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:30,040
will blossom in the same way.

788
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,190
At that time

789
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,760
we can plant the balloon flowers,

790
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:36,230
recalling the past

791
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:37,520
and imagining the future together.

792
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:41,150
Okay, you barely pass the test.

793
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:45,950
Where are we burying this time box?

794
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:49,630
We can bury it

795
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,190
under a phoenix tree.

796
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,040
The phoenix tree is called the tree of love.

797
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,600
It symbolizes that we can be together forever.

798
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:58,520
Okay.
