[The Romance of Hua Rong 2]
[EP24]

3
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,400
For the plan today, we are divided into two groups.

4
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,910
One group comprises Rong, Hong, Ling,

5
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:44,120
Qian, and Zhang.

6
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:46,400
As the representatives of the Tianchu Mission,

7
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,270
you will go to Prince Mu's Residence for peace talks.

8
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,310
And I teamed up with Duanmu.

9
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:50,630
We're firstly gonna rescue our father.

10
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:51,830
The first choice is to

11
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:54,000
stay in the Residence keeping our eyes on Kong Lin,

12
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,550
and wait for Qin and Duanmu

13
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,870
to rescue the real Emperor to take charge.

14
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,830
But if it fails,

15
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,190
we'll take the alternative.

16
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,120
That is to sprinkle the Truth Spicy in the diplomatic wine

17
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,270
for the trilateral peace talks

18
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,440
in order to make Kong Lin exposed.

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,270
It's almost time

20
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:09,960
to start.

21
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,080
Qin Shangcheng,

22
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:16,630
Be much careful.

23
00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:18,520
You too.

24
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,750
Come back safely.

25
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:22,240
Don't worry.

26
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,000
I've discussed this with Qin.

27
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,270
If the situation changes,

28
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:27,000
we'll meet at the ruined temple, south of the city.

29
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,160
It's good to have you with me all the time.

30
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:31,829
Of course.

31
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:32,720
You and I

32
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,000
will share weal and woe and never be separated.

33
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:35,670
Why is she here?

34
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:39,960
Your Highness,

35
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,030
His Majesty is being kept in the Secluded House.

36
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:42,910
Come with me and get him out.

37
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,240
The House is usually heavily guarded,

38
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,630
why is there no one here today?

39
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,470
I took His Majesty's token,

40
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,390
and let them all out.

41
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,080
Father.

42
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,600
Father.

43
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,440
You stand back.

44
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:21,270
Father.

45
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,670
-Your Majesty.  -Father.

46
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:23,720
Father.

47
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,030
How is he?

48
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,190
He got poisoned.

49
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:38,190
Let's get him out first,

50
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,160
and find a way to detoxify later.

51
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,160
Your Highness,

52
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:52,960
there are so many soldiers, something is wrong here.

53
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:57,000
Your Highness,

54
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,000
why do you look bad

55
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,880
and worried?

56
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,390
Are you afraid of any changes

57
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:04,470
in the peace talks?

58
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,440
As long as everything goes well

59
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,630
on your side,

60
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,160
I have nothing to worry about.

61
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,000
Your Highness,

62
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,110
I've been dictatorial since I was a child.

63
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,800
In anything I decide,

64
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,320
no one is allowed to be involved.

65
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,920
In my opinion, behind all the contradictions

66
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,200
between us before

67
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,230
are my striving for the greatest interests of Wanjiang.

68
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,110
Now that I failed in this game

69
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:24,950
and lost the cannon map,

70
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,790
signing the trilateral peace agreement

71
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,160
would be the best choice

72
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,390
for Wanjiang.

73
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,510
If that's what you mean,

74
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,110
which can be proved with practical actions,

75
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:34,950
I can recognize you as my younger brother.

76
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,550
You'll feel my sincerity.

77
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:38,600
Your Highness, please.

78
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:43,600
General Jin.

79
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,480
Going to the toilet before the battle

80
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,350
is still your thing.

81
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,640
General Jin,

82
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,230
just now, someone entrusted me

83
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,230
to invite you for a chat.

84
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,510
Who?

85
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:57,510
Duanmu Qingcang.

86
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,000
Lead the way.

87
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,070
Rong,

88
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,440
do you believe what Jin Tong just said?

89
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:09,790
It's time to test how smart he is.

90
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,160
If I were him,

91
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:11,950
I would never treat

92
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,640
Qin and Rong as opponents.

93
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,350
There is no chance of winning at all.

94
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,510
I feel much better

95
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,000
to hear you say that.

96
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,760
He should not make any trouble today.

97
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,070
We just need to wait for Qin's news.

98
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,760
Your Majesty.

99
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,950
General Jin.

100
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:41,640
Forego the formalities.

101
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,790
Your Majesty, I'm wondering

102
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,390
the reason for our private conversation.

103
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:49,159
I wanna discuss with you

104
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:51,600
the future of our three countries.

105
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:53,550
Now that it's about three countries,

106
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,270
why are there no people from Tianchu?

107
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:56,070
Never mind,

108
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:58,350
Hua Rong will be here soon.

109
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,390
It's just that

110
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,510
you'll never

111
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:02,920
see her again.

112
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,070
You...

113
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,480
You...

114
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:15,640
Why？

115
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,350
Why？

116
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:38,640
My right eye has been twitching today.

117
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:39,880
Oh, no.

118
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,670
Twitching on the right eye forecasts disasters.

119
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:41,830
This is an ominous sign.

120
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,510
Kong Lin hasn't arrived yet,

121
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:45,270
is there any plot-breeding of him?

122
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:48,000
I wonder how His Lord is doing.

123
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,480
Your Highness,

124
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:50,040
anything special about the compass?

125
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,920
General Hua Jr.

126
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,480
Here is your letter.

127
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,950
Something's happening.

128
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,270
There might be problems in the peace talks.

129
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,830
Come quickly and have a talk at the hall.

130
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:03,720
Should there be no fraud?

131
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,230
It's Jin Tong's handwriting.

132
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:07,790
I'll go there and check it out.

133
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:08,760
You just wait for me here.

134
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:25,000
Island Lord Qin.

135
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,000
Your Highness.

136
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,200
Why are you here?

137
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,670
At my Lady's disposal, of course.

138
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:30,000
She was worried that you would need help,

139
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,160
so she let me wait here

140
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:31,950
with the medicine box.

141
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:32,880
The wing-room is ready.

142
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,640
Please come with me.

143
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:51,760
How's it going?

144
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,350
The toxicity is odd.

145
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,270
I need a few days to confirm it.

146
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:56,920
Can you wake him up

147
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,230
in a short time?

148
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,230
I'll try acupuncture.

149
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,510
The sooner, the better.

150
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,640
Rong and the others are still waiting for us.

151
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:05,480
You two stay here to help Duanmu.

152
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,230
I'm gonna outside doing surveillance.

153
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:06,920
Okay.

154
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:39,280
General Jin, what do you bring me here for?

155
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,280
Hello?

156
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:00,760
Damn it!

157
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,880
It was a setup.

158
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:02,590
Hua Rong,

159
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,640
Why did you kill General Jin?

160
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:07,280
He regarded you as his sister out of respect.

161
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,520
But you cared nothing about him,

162
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,640
or about the diplomatic relations,

163
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,470
but killed him just because of personal grudges.

164
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,960
I'll gonna avenge his death!

165
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,790
Lieutenant General Wu,

166
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,840
you haven't checked it yet.

167
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,880
How did you know that he was dead?

168
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:21,200
You are expert at copying drawings.

169
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,150
It must be a cinch for you

170
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,200
to forge someone's handwriting, isn't it?

171
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:28,550
General Jin was killed by a blow from the back.

172
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:30,520
Who

173
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,440
can take him off guard?

174
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:32,640
Only you!

175
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,470
Hua Rong,

176
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,110
you're slinging mud at me.

177
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,880
What happened?

178
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,470
Your Majesty.

179
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,080
Hua Rong killed General Jin.

180
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,080
I saw it with my own eyes.

181
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,470
Please severely punish the murderer.

182
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,150
Now that we have the witness here,

183
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,030
the South Desolation

184
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:48,150
must give an explanation to the Wanjiang Mission.

185
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:48,790
Guards!

186
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,640
Pull her in!

187
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,440
Do you think are these people enough

188
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,710
to trap me here?

189
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,520
You're right.

190
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,000
As the leader of the Imperial Alliance,

191
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,710
you have excellent martial arts

192
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:07,520
and are immune to all poisons.

193
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,110
It's really hard to keep you.

194
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,440
But have you ever thought about

195
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:14,760
Chi Hong and Ling?

196
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:17,320
Can they get out of here?

197
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,230
You just want to trade me

198
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,150
for the cannon map from Qin Shangcheng.

199
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:24,440
Let them go.

200
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,590
I'll stay here.

201
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:28,840
There we go.

202
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:35,670
My Lord.

203
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,350
My Lord.

204
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,280
My Lord.

205
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,000
Where is Rong?

206
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,590
She...

207
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:45,080
Rong was framed by Kong Lin

208
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,760
as the murderer of Jin Tong.

209
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,030
She was arrested.

210
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:50,470
My Lord.

211
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:50,670
My Lord.

212
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:51,400
-My Lord.
-Qin Shangcheng.

213
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:51,670
My Lord.

214
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,200
Let go of me.

215
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:52,710
My Lord.

216
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:54,350
The Residence must have been

217
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:55,200
so closely hemmed in on all sides, because Kong Lin

218
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,230
knew you couldn't wait to save Her Highness.

219
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,080
-My Lord.
-Qin Shangcheng.

220
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:59,000
Rong had a chance to escape there,

221
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,440
but she offered to exchange for our safety.

222
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,670
What do you think

223
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:03,710
she did it for?

224
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,550
She's not just trying to protect us.

225
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,590
She wanted us not to waste time telling you

226
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:09,230
not to act rashly and trap yourself.

227
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,520
Since you have a double happiness,

228
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,960
I wanna celebrate

229
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,710
with this glass of wine.

230
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,550
What the hell are you trying to do?

231
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,150
Just trade your own life

232
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:28,880
for the safety of your friends.

233
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,280
For one thing,

234
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:31,840
you're so spunky.

235
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,790
For another, Cheng is quick-witted.

236
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,000
He played tricks on me,

237
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,440
getting Duanmu Qingcang

238
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,200
out of

239
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:39,910
the Secluded House.

240
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,030
As for me,

241
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,590
I lost a key piece,

242
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,910
making me under adversities.

243
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:46,280
Given these facts,

244
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,400
shouldn't we celebrate?

245
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:59,670
Having opponents like you,

246
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:02,000
I'm really gratified.

247
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,550
But you must

248
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,000
have never expected that

249
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,230
I poisoned Duanmu Qingcang in advance.

250
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,030
That is, "Dead Sleep".

251
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:18,110
And I'm the only one in the world

252
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,350
who has the antidote.

253
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,000
They saved

254
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,280
a dying person,

255
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:27,150
but left you here.

256
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:28,590
I'm not losing anything

257
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,710
in this business.

258
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:32,960
Don't waste your time.

259
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,790
Qin Shangcheng won't give you the map.

260
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,710
But based on what I know about him,

261
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,440
he would never

262
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:47,000
leave you and the unborn child behind.

263
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,280
I already gave a decapitation order.

264
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,200
Even if

265
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,550
he knows it is a trap,

266
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:59,710
he will definitely take the bait.

267
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:25,470
At the time of the trilateral peace talks,

268
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:26,670
Hua Rong, the envoy of Tianchu,

269
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:27,350
deliberately murdered Jin Tong,

270
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:29,670
the General of the Wanjiang mission,

271
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,400
and sabotaged the talks between the three countries.

272
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,080
Therefore, this unforgivable sinner

273
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,320
will be beheaded at Wuyang Gate at noon tomorrow.

274
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:37,350
It will be personally supervised by His Majesty

275
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,110
to give the world an explanation.

276
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,400
Kong Lin, son of a bitch!

277
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,590
This was specially made for us.

278
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,150
But

279
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,760
fortunately, His Lord was superior in stratagem.

280
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,640
The Emperor was rescued in advance.

281
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,030
If the Emperor exposes Kong Lin in public tomorrow,

282
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,910
he will have nowhere

283
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,520
to hide.

284
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,150
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

285
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,960
How is our father?

286
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:04,760
He's still in a coma.

287
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,110
But I have found out

288
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,960
the poison

289
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,470
is “Dead Sleep”.

290
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,080
It was exclusively developed by Kong Lin.

291
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:13,320
He is the only one

292
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:14,710
who has the antidote.

293
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,080
How long will the Emperor live?

294
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,710
If there is no antidote,

295
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,910
one day later

296
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:23,910
he never wakes up again.

297
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,790
Do we have any other solutions?

298
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,080
There is only one left,

299
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,840
the method of transferring poison.

300
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,280
I'll find a way

301
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:39,150
to transfer the poison to my body.

302
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:40,670
Only in this way,

303
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,280
can we have a chance to detoxify it.

304
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,080
But

305
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,320
there is only a 30% chance

306
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,400
that I can develop the antidote

307
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:49,710
by noon tomorrow.

308
00:14:58,350 --> 00:14:59,640
Our lives are at stake.

309
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:01,230
Ling,

310
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,640
Are you scared?

311
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:04,880
Yes.

312
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,790
Born in the royal family,

313
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:13,320
I should have been fearless.

314
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:15,880
But since I met you,

315
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,440
something changed.

316
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,030
I'm afraid of losing you.

317
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:27,710
Take it easy.

318
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,640
I can protect you,

319
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,520
and myself.

320
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,110
What is it?

321
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,280
Just open it.

322
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:49,230
This

323
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:50,470
is a heart-shaped amulet

324
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:52,200
with our fingerprints on it.

325
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,760
It can not only keep you safe,

326
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,840
but stick our hearts

327
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,110
together forever.

328
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,590
Where did you get the fingerprints?

329
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,200
Do you remember

330
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,440
the handprinted marriage certificate

331
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,640
we gave to His Lord and Her Highness?

332
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,030
After they tore it up,

333
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,550
I picked up all the pieces

334
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:11,760
and found the part

335
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,200
with ours.

336
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,230
I thought

337
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,590
I'd surprise you.

338
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:19,550
Do you like it?

339
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,200
Definitely.

340
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,670
Duanmu Bai!

341
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:54,470
Have you really decided to do this?

342
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,350
There is no need to hesitate about it.

343
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,640
Maybe you can fool others,

344
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,880
but I know exactly what this means.

345
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:01,960
For your leg injury,

346
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:04,280
I looked through the Imperial Alliance Medical Canon

347
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,430
for any possible treatment.

348
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:07,920
And I saw the method of transferring poison.

349
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,160
Just like the blood exchange

350
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,310
it is forbidden by the Imperial Alliance.

351
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:13,920
And comparatively,

352
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,400
it's even more dangerous.

353
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,829
Once it fails,

354
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:18,190
you will die.

355
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:20,430
You should believe in my medical skills.

356
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,950
I'm afraid the success rate is less than 30%.

357
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,710
You could die for it.

358
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,760
Although he is not my biological father,

359
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:35,400
he has been strict with me since childhood.

360
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,310
Even though he knew I wasn't his natural child,

361
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,920
he still treated me as his own.

362
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,640
It's time to repay his kindness.

363
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,040
Besides, this matter

364
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,880
is related to the fate of our three countries.

365
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:48,920
So as long as there is a glimmer of hope,

366
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,190
I will proceed without hesitation.

367
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,310
Gotcha.

368
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:54,800
If I were you,

369
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:56,710
I would make the same choice.

370
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:58,830
But remember

371
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,590
you must survive.

372
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:03,950
Otherwise, I would follow you.

373
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,280
When it is over,

374
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:21,760
I must give you an answer.

375
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,560
I hope you will keep your word this time.

376
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:46,830
Hui,

377
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:50,280
we've been apart for so long.

378
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,920
How are you and our child doing?

379
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:22,590
Qin Shangcheng,

380
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:24,430
All the time

381
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,000
as long as the bell rings,

382
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,520
you will be there for me.

383
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:29,760
So I always

384
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,280
feel safe

385
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,640
with the bell on me.

386
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,830
But now I understand

387
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:37,230
what gives me a sense of security

388
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,430
is the trust between us.

389
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,400
I trust you'll save me

390
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:43,880
and our child from the execution tomorrow.

391
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,430
Rong,

392
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,680
wait for me.

393
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,800
Rong,

394
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:13,680
since you used to be my daughter-in-law,

395
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,800
I'll award you a glass of wine

396
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:16,590
to make you braver

397
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,710
before the execution.

398
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,310
Shut up.

399
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,830
Just kill me.

400
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:27,190
Qin Shangcheng hasn't arrived yet,

401
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,470
how could I let you go?

402
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,590
It's just that

403
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:32,230
this wine will help

404
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,950
your unborn baby

405
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:36,110
go one step

406
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:38,000
ahead of you.

407
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,110
Kong Lin,

408
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:39,920
how dare you?

409
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:41,310
Of course I do.

410
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:44,830
Well,

411
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:48,310
I'll

412
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,800
feed you in person.

413
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,520
Stop it!

414
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,160
All back off.

415
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:41,800
Qin Shangcheng,

416
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,710
I guessed

417
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:45,230
you would come.

418
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:47,800
But I didn't expect you

419
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:50,110
to come here alone.

420
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:51,310
Don't you

421
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:53,230
know what

422
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:54,710
"death" is?

423
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,110
Rong is my wife.

424
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,400
She still has my baby in her belly.

425
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,230
Definitely,

426
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,280
I'll take them with me.

427
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,160
Alright,

428
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:07,830
you should know

429
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:09,470
what I want.

430
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,400
The cannon map is right here.

431
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:14,590
If you want it,

432
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,110
set Rong free.

433
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:18,110
You are in no condition to negotiate with me.

434
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:20,070
Just make a choice,

435
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:21,400
the map,

436
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:24,160
or the life of them.

437
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:29,710
If you want the map,

438
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,710
here you are.

439
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,040
Qin Shangcheng,

440
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:04,230
don't you dare tease me?

441
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:06,230
First,

442
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:07,400
you're a fake per se.

443
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:09,470
So drop the act.

444
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,430
Second,

445
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:12,640
that picture was really painted by Master Yi,

446
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:14,680
what do you mean by "teasing"?

447
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:17,230
Since you have no sincerity to cooperate,

448
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:19,070
I have to arrest you first

449
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:20,520
and torture you to confess.

450
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,710
Qin Shangcheng.

451
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,950
Qin Shangcheng.

452
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,470
Qin Shangcheng, let go the rope.

453
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:59,070
As long as I still breathe，

454
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,880
I would allow any harm

455
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,640
to both of you.

456
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,800
Qin Shangcheng.

457
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:10,400
Now it's your turn

458
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,830
to be trampled on by me.

459
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:14,230
It's time to test your perseverance.

460
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:20,350
Qin Shangcheng, let it go!

461
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:22,070
Leave me alone!

462
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:42,710
Qin Shangcheng.

463
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:47,470
Why are you still standing there?

464
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:49,230
Arrest them now!

465
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:52,230
Qin Shangcheng.

466
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:55,470
My Lord.

467
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,350
Do you think that you callow youths

468
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:06,950
can take them away?

469
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:08,350
Don't forget,

470
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:10,310
this is my territory.

471
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,950
Soldiers, stop!

472
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,760
-Your Majesty.  -Your Majesty.

473
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,400
This man, named Kong Lin,

474
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:00,830
pretended to be the emperor of the South Desolation,

475
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:01,920
He created chaos and triggered the war

476
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,590
between the South Desolation and Tianchu.

477
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:04,880
Don't be fooled by

478
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,310
this dead rat.

479
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,520
We have saved the true Emperor.

480
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:12,160
We all obey Your Royal Highness.

481
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,350
Mu Qing,

482
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:33,040
today

483
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,520
I brought Cheng, Bai,

484
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:37,400
and their wives here

485
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,880
to visit you.

486
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,920
Thanks to their efforts,

487
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,280
the South Desolation

488
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,830
survived this disaster.

489
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,430
I hope your spirit in heaven

490
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:48,710
can bless them

491
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:49,830
and future generations

492
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:51,590
all well.

493
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:04,040
This time, it's all my carelessness

494
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,310
that gave Kong Lin

495
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,350
a chance to wreak havoc.

496
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:10,190
Fortunately, you two brothers worked together

497
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:11,310
and saved the day.

498
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:12,830
Father,

499
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:14,800
we are a family.

500
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:16,590
These are what we should do.

501
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:19,040
Father,

502
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,710
it's unfair.

503
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:22,640
Chi Hong and I also made great contributions.

504
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,310
How could I forget that?

505
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:27,190
By the time,

506
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:29,710
I will pay it back to Tianchu with interest.

507
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,760
It's wise of you!

508
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:33,920
Bai,

509
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:35,350
Cheng and Rong

510
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:37,310
have told me about your affairs.

511
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,680
It's time

512
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,560
to legitimate your relationship.

513
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:43,280
That's right, Duanmu Bai.

514
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,070
Don't tell me

515
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,560
you haven't answered Chi Hong!

516
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:47,310
Rong, you are wrong about him.

517
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:48,640
He promised me yesterday.

518
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,520
He can be the minister of the Imperial Alliance

519
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,110
and my husband.

520
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,470
Sounds cool.

521
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,950
That's my boy,

522
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:57,000
acting with courage and determination.

523
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:58,800
By the way,

524
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:00,760
as for Her Queen Mother,

525
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,680
how's she doing?

526
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:02,830
Don't worry.

527
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,520
She has received acupuncture.

528
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,640
And she'll wake up in a few days.

529
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,710
That's good.

530
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:08,830
Now

531
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:09,710
you can

532
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:11,470
take a few days off in the capital.

533
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,430
I will take care of

534
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:14,590
Her Queen Mother.

535
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,160
It's time

536
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:17,830
for me to fulfill

537
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:20,160
my filial obligations as a son.

538
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,520
Slow down.

539
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,400
Be careful.

540
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:27,560
Okay.

541
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,560
Your Queen Mother,

542
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:33,000
Cheng has told me the whole story.

543
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,230
It was you

544
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,680
help them discover

545
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,110
the traitor of Kong Lin

546
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,830
and his audacious conspiracy.

547
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:41,190
No one knows a man better than his own mother.

548
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:43,710
Even if everyone was cheated by him,

549
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:45,280
I was an exception.

550
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:46,880
Father,

551
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:48,070
Grandmother,

552
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,880
You're coming.

553
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,430
Your Queen Mother.

554
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,710
Your Majesty.

555
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:56,920
Forego the formalities.

556
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,000
You look good, grandma.

557
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,470
Yeah.

558
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:03,950
Bai has superb medical skills.

559
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:05,680
So I feel

560
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,800
perfectly well now.

561
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,640
That's all because of your good physical foundation.

562
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:12,110
You know how to make me happy.

563
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:16,310
Grandmother,

564
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,350
and father,

565
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,430
we have come

566
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,950
to bid you farewell.

567
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,280
We are gonna leave here.

568
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,400
I know you won't stay long.

569
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:29,520
But before you go,

570
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,350
I still have something to say

571
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,920
to Rong and Hong.

572
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,640
Your Queen Mother,

573
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,680
I happen to

574
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,400
have something to

575
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,710
tell Cheng and Bai.

576
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:45,160
Do you

577
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,160
remember Wu Ren?

578
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:49,230
Isn't he

579
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:50,680
the lieutenant of Jin Tong?

580
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,110
What are you going to do with him？

581
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:54,190
I have sent him back to Wanjiang.

582
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:55,880
He killed Jin Tong

583
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,830
and sabotaged the peace talks.

584
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:58,400
Wanjiang

585
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,160
has its own decision to

586
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,110
deal with him.

587
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:01,560
In addition,

588
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,230
Rong also reminded me

589
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:05,110
that there are a group of orphans

590
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:06,160
in the children's courtyard of Jin Tong.

591
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,950
I have sent teachers from the Imperial College

592
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:08,830
to look after them.

593
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:09,950
They will

594
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:11,520
get a good education.

595
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:13,070
Thank you.

596
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,040
Alright,

597
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:18,470
although the peace talks were destroyed by Kong Lin,

598
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:20,190
the great cause of our three countries

599
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,760
won't end here, will it?

600
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:22,920
No.

601
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,800
Of course not.

602
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,430
I have already contacted Wanjiang and Tianchu

603
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:28,640
to re-sign the peace talks agreement.

604
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,920
The place of peace talks

605
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,280
was chosen in Tianchu.

606
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,190
It wise of you!

607
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:35,950
Living in a peaceful world

608
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:38,560
is not only a wish of you,

609
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,830
but of

610
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:42,040
all the common people.

611
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,710
Why don't I do it?

612
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,040
It's a pity that

613
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,830
a grown boy can't be kept at home.

614
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:51,920
My two sons

615
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,190
are leaving me.

616
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:58,760
Father, please rest assured

617
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,800
that whenever we are free,

618
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,800
we will

619
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,880
visit you and grandmother.

620
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,640
Of course.

621
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,160
After my child is born,

622
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,110
we'll bring the baby here.

623
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,470
If you don't come back,

624
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:09,000
I'll give an order to arrest you two.

625
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,830
Rong,

626
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:14,590
Hong,

627
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,560
I've only been awake for a few days,

628
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,230
but you're leaving.

629
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:22,160
I didn't even spend time

630
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,470
with my granddaughters-in-law.

631
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:25,800
Alas!

632
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,760
Your Queen Mother,

633
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,000
I am definitely your granddaughter-in-law.

634
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,190
But Hong has not married yet.

635
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,350
I have the final say in Duanmu family.

636
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,560
As long as you give me an approving nod,

637
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
you're also my granddaughter-in-law

638
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,280
from today.

639
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,760
It's all up to you.

640
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,400
It's a deal.

641
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:51,310
This is a jade bracelet made under my request.

642
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:52,190
Here you are.

643
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,880
How fancy!

644
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,400
From now on,

645
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:00,590
we are a family.

646
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:02,310
Thank you, Your Queen Mother.

647
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,190
That's so good.

648
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:08,760
Come on.

649
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,400
Cheers.

650
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,470
Cheers.

651
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:15,520
This year

652
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,590
witnessed many stories.

653
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,520
Back in the day, Duanmu and I...

654
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:22,880
This year

655
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,310
witnessed many stories.

656
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,190
Back in the day,

657
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:27,040
Duanmu Bai and I pretended to be a couple,

658
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,670
and went to the South Desolation

659
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:28,190
for the royal intermarriage.

660
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:29,400
Unexpectedly, all roads reach the same goal now.

661
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,760
We are really a family.

662
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,160
Back in the day,

663
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,920
I was trying to make Qin Shangcheng my husband.

664
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:34,710
Now

665
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:36,160
I've got even with Rong.

666
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,470
For me,

667
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,520
I was young and ignorant.

668
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,000
And I adored Qin.

669
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,310
Your Royal Highness,

670
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,800
it sounds like

671
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,280
Qin is not worthy of your adoration,

672
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:45,830
isn't it?

673
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:46,920
Don't stir up troubles.

674
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,430
That's not what I meant.

675
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:49,110
Correct.

676
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:49,640
My Lady,

677
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,880
could you please control your sweetie?

678
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,310
Shut up.

679
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,040
You...

680
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,470
Hong,

681
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:56,400
you're awesome.

682
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,230
Even a private person like him became so interesting

683
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:59,470
under your training,

684
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:00,760
and even learned to ridicule people.

685
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,470
I'm flattered.

686
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,110
But don't get me wrong.

687
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:05,640
I haven't seen Hua Sanlang's

688
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,920
The Thirty-six Stratagems for Controlling Husband.

689
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:08,230
Hong!

690
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:09,429
Oh my god.

691
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,560
It turned out that crap was written by Hua Sanlang.

692
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,120
This is crazy!

693
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,909
Qian Dayou!

694
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:14,909
After getting back to the island,

695
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:16,429
I'll throw away Hui's

696
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:17,280
the Thirty-six Stratagems.

697
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:17,630
You're right!

698
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:18,520
-No way!  -Throw it away as soon as possible.

699
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,840
Zhang Xian, give it to me.

700
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,190
No problem.

701
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:21,560
No way!

702
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:21,949
It's all yours.

703
00:34:21,949 --> 00:34:22,429
You can't do that.

704
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:23,670
I have the whole series.

705
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:24,320
I'll give you all.

706
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:24,760
Your Highness,

707
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:25,630
-Your Highness.  -That's amazing.

708
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:26,150
Duanmu.

709
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:26,840
Here's to you.

710
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:28,320
-It's all your fault!  -After today,

711
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:28,949
I'm sorry.

712
00:34:28,949 --> 00:34:29,909
what are your plans?

713
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:33,600
I know what you're trying to say.

714
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:35,909
Tomorrow I will set out to

715
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,230
visit my father's tomb.

716
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,909
He would be gratified

717
00:34:41,469 --> 00:34:42,760
if he knew in another world.

718
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,120
Come on.

719
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,120
Come on.

720
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:45,520
Bottoms up!

721
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:46,840
Have you forgotten

722
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:48,360
that you promised me last night

723
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,389
to take me around the world?

724
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:52,280
No problem.

725
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:53,909
As you wish.

726
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:54,949
I'll go

727
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,120
wherever you go.

728
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:57,760
That's more like it.

729
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:02,760
You're definitely a faithful echo of your wife.

730
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,430
Exactly.

731
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:05,760
I didn't expect you and I

732
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,360
should go the same way.

733
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,230
Come on.

734
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:09,800
Here's to you.

735
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,320
My Lord,

736
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:12,670
it seems that I did the same.

737
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:13,800
For what?

738
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,120
Come on,

739
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:16,280
let's drink together.

740
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:16,470
Come on.

741
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:17,280
Cheers!

742
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,520
Cheers!

743
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,320
But Qian Dayou,

744
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,710
I believe you should make the relationship public.

745
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:34,390
Well,

746
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:35,800
I'm sincerely...

747
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:39,840
I'm

748
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,430
sincerely gonna introduce to you

749
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:42,280
this beautiful lady,

750
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:44,470
my candied girl.

751
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:46,470
And this is

752
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:48,520
my donkey boy.

753
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:49,600
But

754
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,760
recently,

755
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,870
he has got some problems.

756
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:52,800
What's wrong?

757
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,870
Did you bully her?

758
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,840
You wronged me, Your Highness.

759
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,150
Here is the story.

760
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:59,280
Ling explained our relationship to His Majesty,

761
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,950
my future father-in-law.

762
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:03,040
-We know it.  -Get to the point!

763
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:06,280
His Majesty disapproved at first.

764
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:06,870
But

765
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:08,360
with heartfelt attempts made by Ling,

766
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:09,390
he finally agreed.

767
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,630
However,

768
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,800
there is an additional condition

769
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,190
that I must be the champion

770
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:16,950
in the Imperial Examination.

771
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:18,320
You're finished.

772
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:18,710
Oh my god.

773
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:19,630
Forget it.

774
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:20,710
Ling, you'd better give up.

775
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:22,320
As for Qian Dayou,

776
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:23,520
he is only a good-for-nothing adviser.

777
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,630
But being the champion?

778
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:25,600
Just forget it.

779
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,190
No way!

780
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,190
My Lady and Your Highness,

781
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:28,470
are you looking down on me?

782
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:29,560
Well.

783
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:30,710
Today

784
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,000
I'll make an oath

785
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,120
in front of My Lord

786
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:33,760
and you all.

787
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,870
I'll never give up until I win the champion.

788
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:36,870
When that day comes,

789
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:38,040
I will

790
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,080
marry Ling.

791
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,800
Sounds cool.

792
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,150
That's awesome.

793
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:43,040
Come on!

794
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:44,630
Qian Dayou,

795
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:45,670
If your article

796
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:47,190
is half as good as your mouth,

797
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:48,840
I believe in your words.

798
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,000
-My Lord.
-I agree.

799
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,800
In short, to your distant dream,

800
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:52,910
cheers!

801
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:55,280
Cheers!

802
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,600
Cheers.

803
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,840
But Ling

804
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,320
I still want to tell you that

805
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,710
the actions of a man

806
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:04,910
speak louder

807
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:06,230
than his words.

808
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,560
Rong, don't worry.

809
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,710
Anyway,

810
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:09,560
my sweetie

811
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,520
has the right

812
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,040
attitude now.

813
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,390
Recently,

814
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:15,080
he has been studying

815
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,000
the Four Books and Five Classics day and night.

816
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,840
For the sake of love,

817
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,080
he has thrown himself without hesitation

818
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,470
into the sea of knowledge.

819
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:22,430
You know me best.

820
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:23,600
Zhang Xian,

821
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:25,760
do you want to take the exam with me?

822
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,760
We'll be the champion respectively in literature,

823
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,360
and martial arts.

824
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,000
That's amazing!

825
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,320
And you can learn some words.

826
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:30,710
I don't care.

827
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,360
Hui will be having the baby soon,

828
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:33,840
I wanna hurry back to the island,

829
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,670
preparing to be a daddy.

830
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,230
That's great! You save me trouble.

831
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:38,280
Zhang Xian is right.

832
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:39,950
this is

833
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:41,470
what I should do too.

834
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,520
Hong,

835
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,080
Ling,

836
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,080
let's propose a toast

837
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,080
to the three future daddies here.

838
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:47,470
Cool.

839
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,280
Cheers!

840
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,120
Cheers!

841
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:50,560
Your Highness,

842
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:51,910
I represent Hui.

843
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,080
Alright.

844
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,000
Come on, let's drink together.

845
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:54,670
Together!

846
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:55,670
Come on!

847
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:57,390
To daddies,

848
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:59,120
cheers!

849
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,560
Qin Shangcheng,

850
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:21,670
you gave up the position of the crown prince,

851
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,150
what were you thinking about?

852
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,950
Don't you also give up the position of the crown princess?

853
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:31,430
I'm singing along with my husband.

854
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:34,760
I just want us to be

855
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,360
a free pirate couple.

856
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:38,910
All right.

857
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,360
In this way, we can live a peaceful life.

858
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,170
And I can go back to Huarong Island

859
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:43,840
waiting for our baby.

860
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,190
But

861
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:48,560
if we meet a second Jin Duoxiong,

862
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,000
or a second Kong Lin,

863
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,230
what should we do?

864
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:53,040
Don't worry.

865
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,950
When it happens, Swordsman Yunhe,

866
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,320
Swordswoman Huahua,

867
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,950
and Swordsbaby Daodao,

868
00:38:58,630 --> 00:38:59,800
our family

869
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,760
is duty-bound

870
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,120
to cut off evildoers.

871
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,560
You can strike a balance

872
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,120
between the family and the world,

873
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:10,470
keeping all safe.

874
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,560
You're the perfect husband in my mind.

875
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,190
Speaking of Daodao,

876
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,390
I didn't expect the other Daodao to come.

877
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:21,190
Daodao.

878
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:22,520
Do you miss us?

879
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,840
You've grown up.

880
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:26,390
Now

881
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:28,320
we're not a family of three swordsmen,

882
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,600
but four.

883
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:08,600
Be careful.

884
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,230
Never mind.

885
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,520
Hong,

886
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:14,320
why didn't you tell us you were coming?

887
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,040
You flatter yourself.

888
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:16,870
I'm not here to see you,

889
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:20,080
but him.

890
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:21,950
Baby Daodao,

891
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:22,800
do you remember me?

892
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:24,430
I'm your auntie Chi Hong.

893
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:25,520
He does.

894
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,430
How's it going?

895
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:27,670
It's wonderful.

896
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:29,360
My little brother,

897
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,710
I heard you

898
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:32,120
had a really good trip in Nanyang.

899
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:33,430
Really?

900
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:34,520
I promised to take her around the world.

901
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,470
Besides, it is the place where our father went.

902
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,470
It's like I walked the way

903
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,470
our father did.

904
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:39,390
So romantic!

905
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:40,230
Most importantly,

906
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:42,280
he proposed to me

907
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,360
at the Torch Festival in Nanyang.

908
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,230
Look at them.

909
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:46,950
How romantic they are!

910
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:48,470
We'll make it up later,

911
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:49,150
okay?

912
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:50,520
I've been different under the influence

913
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,710
of His Lord and Qian Dayou.

914
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,910
It was designed by myself,

915
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:58,120
and made by a skillful craftsman I invited.

916
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,950
It took three months to finish this

917
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:01,870
mother-daughter concentric bracelet.

918
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:04,560
Now that you have proposed,

919
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,390
I'll help you with the wedding ceremony.

920
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,360
Wait a moment.

921
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,800
Maybe I'm order than you.

922
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:10,000
Don't talk nonsense,

923
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,630
my little brother.

924
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:12,430
Why don't you know how to behave?

925
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:12,870
I'm the elder brother.

926
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:13,150
Come on,

927
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:14,470
you are so naive

928
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:15,320
to argue about this.

929
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:15,670
Correct.

930
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:16,910
Fortunately, our child doesn't have to do this.

931
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:17,670
Daodao

932
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:18,710
must be the elder brother.

933
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,360
How do you know this is a boy?

934
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,190
Maybe a girl.

935
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,320
It doesn't matter.

936
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:24,520
My Lord.

937
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:25,950
My Lord.

938
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:27,080
Qian.

939
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,230
Qian.

940
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:28,840
My Lord.

941
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,280
Your Highness.

942
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:29,840
Zhang.

943
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,120
My Lord.

944
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:33,670
Zhang.

945
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:34,710
Qian.

946
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:38,150
Put me down.

947
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,470
Isn't this Eunuch Qian?

948
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:45,120
You finally come back.

949
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:47,120
What the hell is this

950
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:47,560
champion outfit?

951
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,600
It's far behind the pirate suit.

952
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:49,560
My Lord, don't make fun of it.

953
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:49,950
I'm telling you

954
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,150
in order to get this,

955
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:51,910
I've lost a couple of laps.

956
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:52,800
Look at my face.

957
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,390
I didn't see it at all.

958
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:54,840
Are you complaining?

959
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:55,560
No, of course not!

960
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,150
It is extremely worthwhile to make it exchanged

961
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:57,840
for the beauty.

962
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:58,430
Isn't it? My Lord.

963
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,360
Rong,

964
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,150
I envy you so much.

965
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:05,280
You're pregnant with twins,

966
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,760
but you're still in such a good figure.

967
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:08,840
Twins?

968
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,710
How exciting!

969
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:10,150
I'm telling you,

970
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:11,800
as a magical shooter,

971
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,870
His Lord killed two birds with one stone.

972
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:14,800
The twins have already been reserved.

973
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:16,520
Qian Dayou,

974
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,280
stop talking

975
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,280
glibly.

976
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:19,520
Hurry up

977
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,600
and get your baby

978
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,430
with Ling.

979
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,190
Just do it.

980
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,000
Duanmu Bai,

981
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:27,670
if this is your wish,

982
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:28,560
you can consult me.

983
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:29,360
I'm experienced in it.

984
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,320
I can help you.

985
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,230
Don't listen to him.

986
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:32,080
If you can't,

987
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:32,870
I can help you, too.

988
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:33,630
Sorry but I'm good.
