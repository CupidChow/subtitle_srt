00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:43,630
Who are you?

4
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,229
Hand over the Rapier.

5
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,440
Rong!

6
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:02,230
Qin Shangcheng!

7
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,240
Your Highness,

8
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,030
she has come to.

9
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,390
Where am I?

10
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,160
You...

11
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:25,910
How dare you!

12
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,829
It is ridiculous of you not

13
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:29,829
to know the swordswoman Chi Hong,

14
00:02:29,829 --> 00:02:30,800
the Yaksha at Sea.

15
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,670
Chi Hong?

16
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:34,390
What a coincidence!

17
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,440
Thank you for saving my life.

18
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,440
Who are you?

19
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,000
What's your name?

20
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:40,960
Where are you from?

21
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,110
If the woman knows that

22
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:43,270
I'm Qin Shangcheng's wife,

23
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:43,910
she won't spare me.

24
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,880
I have to find a way to get out of here

25
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,800
to go to Qin Shangcheng.

26
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,320
Ms. Swordswoman,

27
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,600
I thought for a while just now

28
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,829
but I could remember nothing.

29
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,880
I don't know who I am

30
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,470
or where I come from.

31
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:58,960
Mr. Hua,

32
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,960
please come to have a look.

33
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:02,880
Okay, okay, okay.

34
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,550
Let me see.

35
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:11,800
What's up?

36
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:12,630
You knew her?

37
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,720
Of course.

38
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,830
And I won't get the wrong person.

39
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,600
She is...

40
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,079
She's your Lucky Star of Love.

41
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:23,750
Really?

42
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:24,600
Your Highness,

43
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,800
then Qin Shangcheng

44
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,550
would be a sure thing in the bag

45
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:29,910
since you have met her.

46
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,910
Qin Shangcheng,

47
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,360
you are mine after all.

48
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:40,440
Well.

49
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,160
Your Highness,

50
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,160
Imperial Alliance Conference

51
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,910
is on the first day of next month.

52
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:47,160
I heard Qin Shangcheng

53
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,470
had set off to Shengcheng.

54
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,030
What beautiful timing!

55
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,470
Then we must set off at once.

56
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,470
Your Highness,

57
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,520
you have to take the Imperial Island Token

58
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,800
if you want to go there.

59
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:01,000
For what I can tell,

60
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:02,470
Hao Weifeng,

61
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,000
the head of Changfeng Armed Escort

62
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:06,720
in Mingzhou City is a bully.

63
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,630
He has the Imperial Island Token.

64
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,240
Your Highness,

65
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,600
it's totally a double gain.

66
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,630
We can not only take the token,

67
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,160
but cut off the evildoer.

68
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,350
Now that Qin Shangcheng has set off

69
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:20,000
and I can't find them even I go back,

70
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,790
it's better to go with Chi Hong

71
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,920
and meet them at Imperial Alliance Conference.

72
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,440
Your Highness,

73
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,760
can I follow you to

74
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,350
the Imperial Alliance Conference

75
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:31,000
to repay you for saving my life?

76
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,000
She's right.

77
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:40,070
With the Lucky Star,

78
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,550
Qin Shangcheng

79
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:42,720
would be a sure thing in the bag

80
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,230
at Imperial Alliance Conference

81
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,760
on the first day of next month.

82
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,070
He would be a sure thing in the bag.

83
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,159
Fine.

84
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,350
It's settled then.

85
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,510
How about calling you Crab

86
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,070
since you can't

87
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,270
remember your name?

88
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,880
Crab?

89
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:58,510
Okay.

90
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,040
Okay.

91
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,640
Thanks for giving me a name.

92
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,390
Nu'er Hong is coming.

93
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,390
Please.

94
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:07,110
Serve several

95
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:07,880
signature dishes here.

96
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,440
No problem.

97
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,230
Your Highness,

98
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:12,830
Hao Weifeng and his people

99
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,640
are in the Deluxe Box on the second floor,

100
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,640
enjoying themselves drinking.

101
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:16,790
How many people are there?

102
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,230
Ten.

103
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,110
We'll eat together when I get back.

104
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,880
By convention,

105
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,510
Your Highness

106
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,480
must drink some Nu'er Hong to warm up.

107
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,040
Do you want some?

108
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:35,159
Thank you.

109
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,720
Meng,

110
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,270
shall we go to help her?

111
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,270
I'm afraid...

112
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,510
Don't worry.

113
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,920
She's worthy of

114
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,670
the name "Yaksha at Sea".

115
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:45,720
It's okay.

116
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,390
No, no.

117
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,510
I'll go to have a look.

118
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:54,920
Wait for me.

119
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:00,440
It's as easy as winking

120
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,670
to take the Imperial Island Token.

121
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,510
See?

122
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,830
I've told you she's great.

123
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,600
No one dares to bully you

124
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,510
with the protection of her.

125
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:09,830
Watch out!

126
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,320
How dangerous!

127
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,270
Yes.

128
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,670
How dangerous!

129
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:26,720
Crab,

130
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,270
you're not only my Lucky Star

131
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,270
but saving my life.

132
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:30,720
From now on

133
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,200
you're my younger sister.

134
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:33,600
We'll become sworn sisters

135
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,270
and go together.

136
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,670
We'll share

137
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:36,670
happiness and hardship

138
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:37,440
starting from today.

139
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,830
We can

140
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:39,600
share everything

141
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,670
except the husband.

142
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:41,200
Yes.

143
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,110
You're absolutely right.

144
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,230
Meng.

145
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,230
Crab,

146
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,270
it's a gift to you

147
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,550
for becoming my sworn sister.

148
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,790
It's the same as my Red Fox Mask.

149
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:12,480
Thank you.

150
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:21,720
Shengcheng is the hub of maritime traffic

151
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,160
of Tianchu, South Desolation and Wanjiang.

152
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,270
But since the fall of Imperial Alliance,

153
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:26,760
it became ownerless.

154
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:27,920
So,

155
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,790
all forces are considering

156
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,200
plans to get it now.

157
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,830
Scatter our people all over here

158
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:35,880
to get some information.

159
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,270
Let me know as soon as

160
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,480
you have any news about Rong.

161
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,270
Yes, My Lord.

162
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,720
Look, Your Highness!

163
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,720
That's King Pirate's ship.

164
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,200
They have arrived as expected.

165
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,070
Then let's go to find out

166
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,000
where they live.

167
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:53,670
Wherever he lives,

168
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,390
he can't escape me.

169
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:58,600
Exactly.

170
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:03,720
By the way,

171
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,350
I have a question.

172
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,200
Why do you like the King Pirate?

173
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:09,350
The facts were plain to see.

174
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:11,230
Both of them are pirates.

175
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,670
And they are the most outstanding of

176
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,270
male and female pirates respectively.

177
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,920
They're equal in social status

178
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,320
and a heaven-made match.

179
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,320
Then it makes sense

180
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,270
according to what you say.

181
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:23,070
But I don't think it's enough

182
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,040
for you to miss him

183
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,270
for so many years.

184
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,550
Qin Shangcheng was the first man

185
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,920
who beat me and saw my face.

186
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,350
You know what I am like.

187
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,840
I'll never like a kept man

188
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,880
inferior to me.

189
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:39,440
Is there no

190
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,590
other reason?

191
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,000
The last

192
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:44,670
but not least,

193
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,470
Qin Shangcheng is

194
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:48,520
very picky.

195
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,080
He's dissatisfied with

196
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,150
a good girl like me.

197
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,550
He is like an unruly eagle,

198
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,000
which makes me want to tame.

199
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,080
I know,

200
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,230
but you're

201
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:01,400
pretty, kind

202
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,230
and the heroine who helps the weak.

203
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,550
You're excellent

204
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,550
enough to deserve better.

205
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,710
The first time I saw Qin Shangcheng,

206
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,910
I made up my mind

207
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,710
to make his ships

208
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:12,790
and himself mine.

209
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:14,910
What a pity!

210
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,200
He married young.

211
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,110
Fortunately,

212
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,320
his wife passed away.

213
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,520
I believe

214
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:23,350
it's God's arrangement

215
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,350
for us to meet again.

216
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,960
Whatever makes you happy.

217
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,910
Excuse me, your dishes.

218
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,280
Thank you.

219
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,440
Crab,

220
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:43,470
why don't you have lunch?

221
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:44,710
I'm thinking

222
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,790
maybe I can meet someone

223
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:47,710
I used to know since there are

224
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:48,910
so many people here.

225
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,550
In Shengcheng,

226
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,350
the good and bad people were mixed together.

227
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,640
It's possible to meet the enemies

228
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,790
who know us before.

229
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,200
They know me,

230
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,590
but I don't know them.

231
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,960
That's dangerous.

232
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,440
Yes.

233
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,880
You're right.

234
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,150
Besides, we came here

235
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:03,790
mainly to find

236
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,030
Qin Shangcheng this time.

237
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,640
So it's better not to make trouble.

238
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,280
We'd better

239
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,790
wear the mask after the meal.

240
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,320
Let's just eat.

241
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,550
Qin Shangcheng has arrived at Shengcheng.

242
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:20,590
How can I find him?

243
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:36,760
My Lord,

244
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,710
don't worry.

245
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:38,790
I've arranged for spies in

246
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:39,760
all restaurants to get news about her Highness.

247
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,590
We'll know it in the first place.

248
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:42,710
Shall we have a meal first?

249
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:43,320
I'm hungry.

250
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,150
I'm starving!

251
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,960
500 grams of beef, please.

252
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,320
One kilo, one kilo please.

253
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,230
Three bowls of rice.

254
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,230
Kung Pao Chicken.

255
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,910
The rice should be a little soft.

256
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:53,200
Yes, yes, yes.

257
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:53,880
It should not be too hard.

258
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,000
But it can't be too soft.

259
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,400
Yes, yes, yes.

260
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,320
And Spicy Chicken.

261
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,320
My Lord can't eat spicy food, can he?

262
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,520
Yes, he can.

263
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,910
What else can we order?

264
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:00,670
This one, please.

265
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:01,710
Smashed cucumbers.

266
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:02,520
Yes, smashed cucumbers.

267
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,590
Excuse me,

268
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,760
please make my dough figurine look domineering.

269
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,230
Domineering.

270
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:24,910
All of the details must be

271
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,150
done very well.

272
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:26,760
No problem.

273
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:35,230
Man in Black?

274
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,470
This is also a good dough figurine.

275
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:49,320
Excuse me.

276
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,590
It's you.

277
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:53,670
Qin Shangcheng.

278
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,400
Your Highness,

279
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:05,520
sorry to keep you.

280
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,590
Duanmu Bai?

281
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:12,880
Master,

282
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:14,840
have you got the Rapier?

283
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,030
It's Prince Mu's Residence that is playing tricks.

284
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:20,790
Stop!

285
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,080
Qin Shangcheng,

286
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:24,910
have you forgotten our agreement three years ago?

287
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:26,320
You will marry me as long as

288
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:27,760
I can beat you.

289
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,760
I have no time to play with you.

290
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,320
And there's no way you can beat me.

291
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,760
How do you know before I try?

292
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:46,590
My Lord.

293
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:47,200
Time to have a meal.

294
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,000
She's Chi Hong for real.

295
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:51,110
Cut the crap.

296
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:52,840
You mean someone dozy is

297
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,080
imitating her?

298
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,030
Come on, Qin Shangcheng!

299
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:57,960
Or

300
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,080
you can't leave today.

301
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:03,590
You're not

302
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:04,400
even qualified

303
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,230
to challenge My Lord, okay?

304
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:05,670
That's right.

305
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,470
Unless you beat us first.

306
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,400
Don't hit me in the face.

307
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:16,280
Are you crazy,

308
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,150
you mad woman?

309
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:18,640
Gentlemen do not fight with women.

310
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,590
Why did you hit me?

311
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,320
That's it.

312
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,470
Besides, My Lord has got married,

313
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,790
you can just give up.

314
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:24,550
Shut up!

315
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,350
Your Highness knows all about it.

316
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:27,790
Qin Shangcheng's wife has already died.

317
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,910
Your Highness will fill the vacancy.

318
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:30,470
I've told you

319
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,150
there was no way you could beat me.

320
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:33,280
Let's go!

321
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,440
Let's go!

322
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,080
Qin Shangcheng,

323
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,960
you can't escape me.

324
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:44,200
Meng,

325
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:45,230
follow him to

326
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:46,080
find out where he goes.

327
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:55,670
So,

328
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:58,110
you can't get

329
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:00,760
the Rapier even you

330
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,790
go in person.

331
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,910
I underestimated him.

332
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,000
But his wife has fallen

333
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,440
off the cliff and died.

334
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,080
Master, you can't show your face.

335
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,150
I'll do it.

336
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:31,230
It's killing me.

337
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:34,200
Oh no, he spotted me.

338
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:36,670
It's you.

339
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,080
What should I do?

340
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:39,910
You know me?

341
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:43,470
Don't you remember me?

342
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,550
I fell into the sea the other day,

343
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,110
and an elder sister saved me.

344
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:49,840
So I can remember

345
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,960
nothing before.

346
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,670
If you know me,

347
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,080
can you tell me

348
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:54,960
who I am?

349
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,350
She's really amnesic

350
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,790
or pretending?

351
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:02,470
More than knowing,

352
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,080
we're fated to meet.

353
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:06,590
Your chat-up is

354
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:07,880
too old-fashioned.

355
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:09,670
Who are you?

356
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,440
Crab,

357
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:13,030
you haven't restored memory,

358
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:13,790
so you can't believe

359
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:14,760
the kept man.

360
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:15,880
Remember,

361
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:18,350
only the charlatans in Jianghu are sincere.

362
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:19,200
Because

363
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:20,590
they lied to you sincerely.

364
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:22,640
Lie to me sincerely?

365
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,230
Miss,

366
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:24,550
I can't tell you

367
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,670
everything here.

368
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:26,960
Even if I tell you,

369
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:28,110
you may not be able to

370
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:29,200
accept it for a while.

371
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:30,790
Please go to where I live,

372
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:32,640
then I'll tell you everything

373
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,400
you want to know.

374
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:34,840
Your Highness,

375
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,150
I want to know my life experience.

376
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,150
So no matter what he said is true or false,

377
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,760
I want to have a try.

378
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,150
Since you insist on going with him,

379
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,710
then I'll keep you company to the end.

380
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,670
What is he doing?

381
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,400
Why is he playing the flute?

382
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:03,400
I have no idea.

383
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:09,960
Can't you remember,

384
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,590
Little White Dove?

385
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,030
Who cares about white doves or quails?

386
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:14,960
I'll see what story

387
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,840
you can make up.

388
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,590
I am Duanmu Bai,

389
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,880
the heir of Prince Mu's Residence

390
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:26,000
in South Desolation.

391
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,520
Little White Dove

392
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,440
is an orphan adopted in the house.

393
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,710
Little White Dove and I

394
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,000
grow up together,

395
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:35,550
attach to each other

396
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:37,030
and have an engagement.

397
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,470
Duanmu Bai, you've changed.

398
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,280
You're starting to make up stories.

399
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,000
But we were framed.

400
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:45,880
My father

401
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,320
was imprisoned.

402
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:50,030
I was forced to marry a girl of Tianchu.

403
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,080
Little White Dove

404
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,000
jumped into the sea and died.

405
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,350
My lord,

406
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:58,000
you mean...

407
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,670
Yes.

408
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,880
You're my fiancee.

409
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:04,230
There are many swindlers like you in Jianghu.

410
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:06,000
Even if you tell a moving story,

411
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,190
I won't believe you.

412
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:09,680
Little White Dove

413
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,829
died on the 15th of last month.

414
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:14,310
Score a lucky hit.

415
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,470
I went to the seaside

416
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:16,829
and searched for her,

417
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:17,800
but failed.

418
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,069
But I firmly believe that she is still alive.

419
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:22,230
There is divine justice after all.

420
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:24,280
I meet you again today.

421
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:26,040
Little White Dove's mom

422
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:27,069
is from Mermaid Tribe.

423
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:28,950
Her mom left her

424
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:29,950
a Mermaid Jade Pendant.

425
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:31,160
Little White Dove

426
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,190
always wears it with her.

427
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:38,560
It's really a Mermaid pattern.

428
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:39,950
Listen to me, Little White Dove.

429
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:41,920
I know you

430
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,920
can't accept it for a while.

431
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:45,590
I'll give you some time

432
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,590
and never force you.

433
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,470
Your Highness,

434
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,710
I want to get out of here first.

435
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,280
Kept man,

436
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,280
we have something to do today.

437
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:53,950
Bye.

438
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,110
Wait.

439
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:55,680
You...

440
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,640
What's the matter with you?

441
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:57,800
You just said you would

442
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,760
give her some time.

443
00:17:59,110 --> 00:17:59,680
Crab,

444
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,430
let's go.

445
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,590
She's a good pawn

446
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:19,070
to deal with Qin Shangcheng.

447
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,400
I'll find Qin Shangcheng quickly

448
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,280
and tell him

449
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,590
Duanmu Bai and Man in Black are in the same team.

450
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:33,950
Crab,

451
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:35,310
are you still thinking of

452
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,830
what the kept man said just now?

453
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,280
Your Highness,

454
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,680
no matter how true it sounds,

455
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,640
I won't believe him unless

456
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,310
I can

457
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,590
remember it.

458
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,040
There's no hurry.

459
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,070
Take your time.

460
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,680
If you remember it,

461
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,160
you can go back to be his wife.

462
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:50,190
If you can't,

463
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:50,920
then you can be

464
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,920
with me as my sister.

465
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:53,830
We can travelling around.

466
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:54,640
It's fun!

467
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:55,640
Besides,

468
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:57,590
the time we become sisters is too short.

469
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,590
I'm not willing to leave you. That's it.

470
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,000
We can

471
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:01,760
get married at the same time until

472
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:02,590
I catch Qin Shangcheng.

473
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:05,520
I met Qin Shangcheng

474
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,560
in the street just now.

475
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:07,680
Really?

476
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:08,520
Where's he?

477
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,350
He got away.

478
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,190
Why did you let him get away?

479
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,160
Don't worry.

480
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:15,590
I'm Swordswoman Chi Hong.

481
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,280
He can't escape me.

482
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:21,040
I've asked Meng to follow him.

483
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:22,590
Your Highness,

484
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:24,350
I found him.

485
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,040
Where's he?

486
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,400
He's in

487
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,190
Room Eight of Sheng Xin Hotel.

488
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,190
Room Eight of Sheng Xin Hotel.

489
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,280
Crab,

490
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:32,950
let's go!

491
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,070
I'll take you to see your brother-in-law.

492
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,070
Meng,

493
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:36,710
lead the way.

494
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:37,230
Okay.

495
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,560
We haven't found her Highness

496
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,830
and the woman is ready to fill the vacancy.

497
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:42,830
I don't want to meet her anymore.

498
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,430
I'll kill her if I meet her.

499
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:44,950
I...

500
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:48,640
There are two mad women

501
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,310
this time.

502
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,470
Tell My Lord first.

503
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:50,920
Let's go.

504
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,640
Sheng Xin Hotel.

505
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:54,950
Great!

506
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:55,920
It must be here.

507
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,040
Go get Qin Shangcheng.

508
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:58,800
Wait.

509
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:01,310
Qin Shangcheng has been avoiding me.

510
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,040
His men must have told him

511
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04,560
when they see me.

512
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,350
You wait here.

513
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:07,590
Meng and I go to the backdoor.

514
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:08,830
Don't worry.

515
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,710
We obstruct his way out at both sides.

516
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:11,710
He can't run away.

517
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:12,800
Today,

518
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,110
I'll let him see you.

519
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:15,950
Come on, Your Highness!

520
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,430
Qin Shangcheng,

521
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:23,520
I have finally found you.

522
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:25,470
My Lord,

523
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:26,520
please listen to us,

524
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:26,880
okay?

525
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,230
My Lord.

526
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:27,760
Gentlemen do not fight with women.

527
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,400
Qin Shangcheng.

528
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:28,950
Don't go there.

529
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:30,160
I'd like to see where you can hide!

530
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,430
You can't escape me.

531
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,000
The task for you.

532
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:34,470
Oh My Lord!

533
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:39,310
Have you two

534
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,230
forgotten the lesson just now?

535
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,830
Don't push us too far.

536
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,310
Zhang!

537
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,470
Qian!

538
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,640
Bye.

539
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,430
So insidious!

540
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:52,470
How dare you defile Your Highness'

541
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:54,110
eyes with such rough bodies.

542
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:07,760
Qin Shangcheng!

543
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:10,400
Qin Shangcheng.

544
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,350
It's you again.

545
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:06,950
Crab has disappeared.

546
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,230
Did you take her away?

547
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,760
She will come in a minute.

548
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:22,880
Duanmu Bai,

549
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:27,040
why are you here?

550
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,040
You'll know it in a minute.

551
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:36,400
Everyone,

552
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,280
I'm Kong Lin, the Minister

553
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:41,470
of Imperial Alliance.

554
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:42,640
Welcome to

555
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,350
the Imperial Alliance Conference.

556
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,640
I know

557
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,160
all of you present are

558
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:50,640
offspring of the elder in Imperial Alliance.

559
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,190
Imperial Alliance

560
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,230
has retired from Jianghu for 20 years.

561
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,230
Today,

562
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:58,310
we gathered for the grand event.

563
00:22:58,430 --> 00:22:59,160
How lucky!

564
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:00,310
How pleasant!

565
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,000
The conference aims to

566
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,950
elect a new leader

567
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,230
of Imperial Alliance.

568
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,310
After that,

569
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:10,430
we'll rely on our joint efforts.

570
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,880
The recovery of Imperial Alliance

571
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:14,590
is just round the corner.

572
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:19,280
I'd like to introduce a distinguished

573
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,040
man from a long distance.

574
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:24,830
The son of Imperial Lady

575
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:26,710
and the heir of South Desolation,

576
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:28,520
Duanmu Bai.

577
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:32,560
He's Duanmu Bai?

578
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,560
The man is the son of Imperial Lady?

579
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,560
What a surprise!

580
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:39,950
I didn't expect Duanmu Bai is

581
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:42,040
the son of Imperial Lady.

582
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,800
It's useless.

583
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:45,760
The person who can draw the Rapier

584
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,040
will be the new leader of Imperial Alliance.

585
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,230
That's it.

586
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:49,040
Some people cannot see

587
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:51,350
the wood for the trees.

588
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,110
Some people close

589
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,800
their ears to the thunder.

590
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,230
The result will tell if I can

591
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,470
be the new leader.

592
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,400
We're not afraid of you.

593
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:02,590
I don't think you deserve to be the leader.

594
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:03,470
I don't think you deserve to be the leader.

595
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,040
You're too weak.

596
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:05,760
Everybody.

597
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,590
Your attention, please.

598
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,760
It must be a tiring journey.

599
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,190
We give a banquet

600
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:13,680
to welcome all of you.

601
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:15,160
I'll ask my men

602
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,310
to send the assignment letter

603
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:19,230
to everyone.

604
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,310
Your assessment

605
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:22,280
begins then.

606
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,520
Today,

607
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,350
just enjoy yourselves.

608
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:35,830
Please.

609
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:36,520
Let's go.

610
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:37,760
My Lord,

611
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:38,880
shall we have a look?

612
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,160
Rong.

613
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:38,350
You're back at last.

614
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,310
I knew you wouldn't break your promise.

615
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,880
Excuse me, please.

616
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,520
Why?

617
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,520
Hand over the Rapier,

618
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,110
or you will die.

619
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,310
- My Lord.
- My Lord.

620
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,560
What are you doing, Crab?

621
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,160
He's Qin Shangcheng,

622
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,040
your brother-in-law in the future.

623
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,430
Why did you kill him?

624
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:10,560
Crab.

625
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,280
Don't chase her.

626
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,160
What's wrong with her Highness?

627
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,680
Let's go back first.

628
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,710
Your Highness,

629
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:22,110
what's wrong with Crab?

630
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:23,000
I don't know.

631
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:23,920
Let's go back.

632
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:40,590
She has lost her memory.

633
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:43,310
As long as you tell her the story

634
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,430
of Little White Dove,

635
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:45,710
she will only belong to you

636
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:48,920
when she wakes up.

637
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,430
Your Highness,

638
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,310
it depends on you whether we can avenge

639
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,110
hundreds of people in Prince Mu's Residence.

640
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,110
You can't have soft nature

641
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,160
if you want to get your way.

642
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:09,350
Your Highness,

643
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:12,070
don't mind temporary loss.

644
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,160
Although we fail to get the Rapier,

645
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,040
it's enough to show that

646
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:19,070
Hua Rong is of vital importance

647
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,710
to Qin Shangcheng.

648
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:22,520
Master, you're right.

649
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,430
As long as we have White Dove,

650
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,830
we'll get the Rapier sooner or later.

651
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:35,070
Something's wrong.

652
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:36,760
She can't be Your Highness.

653
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,310
She never wears too much makeup.

654
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:39,400
And the female assassin

655
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,230
is evil, and she

656
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:41,430
levels a deadly look at My Lord.

657
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:42,590
She must be the assassin disguising herself

658
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:43,920
as her Highness, wearing a mask.

659
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,520
She's Rong.

660
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,680
It can't be wrong.

661
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:51,110
My Lord,

662
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,040
what's going on?

663
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:56,400
My Lord,

664
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,800
it suddenly occurred to me

665
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,070
that there was a story in Hui's

666
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,190
favorite illustrated book.

667
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:02,560
There's a couple.

668
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:03,830
The husband suffers from amnesia,

669
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,350
and he forgets his wife.

670
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,230
My Lord.

671
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:08,760
My Lord.

672
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,230
Yes.

673
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,110
Zhang is right.

674
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:12,190
That's amnesia.

675
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:12,830
Let's see,

676
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,070
Her Highness fell into the sea

677
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:14,830
and lost her memory.

678
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,470
And she was made use of the bad.

679
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,160
Why did Rong ask me for the Rapier?

680
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,230
Is it related to Duanmu Bai?

681
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,110
I'll make it clear in person.

682
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,760
I hear the food in Taoyuan Restaurant is good.

683
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:32,710
My Lord,

684
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:34,470
how can you still think of

685
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:36,590
eating in the circumstances?

686
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,280
Zhang,

687
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,520
you can be stupid,

688
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,920
but you can't be mindless.

689
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:41,280
Do you know what he's thinking?

690
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:42,760
He wants to wait and lead

691
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,800
her Highness into a trap.

692
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,430
Am I right, My Lord?

693
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,310
Ask our people to spread the news

694
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,470
that Qin Shangcheng

695
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,230
will rent Taoyuan Restaurant

696
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,680
to have lunch with his wife.

697
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:53,920
Got it!

698
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:54,760
Okay.

699
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:06,560
Your Highness,

700
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,640
we've moved to

701
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,160
Sheng Xin Hotel as you ordered.

702
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,230
Would you like to

703
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:10,950
check your room?

704
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:11,920
Is Crab back?

705
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,350
No.

706
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:15,590
But I found it at the hotel.

707
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,310
Crab and I separated in the yard.

708
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:22,430
I thought she went out alone.

709
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:23,710
Now it seems

710
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:24,920
she was schemed against.

711
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:26,230
No.

712
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:27,310
I'm going to find her.

713
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,160
Your Highness,

714
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:29,590
you're still thinking about the ungrateful girl?

715
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,680
One second, you were very close.

716
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:33,190
The next she assassinated your man.

717
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,950
Women are so terrifying

718
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:36,110
that they're easy to get angry.

719
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,280
Your Highness,

720
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,190
I'm not talking about you.

721
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,640
We're different from her.

722
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,590
There are three groups of people.

723
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,400
Men, women and female pirates.

724
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,760
The female pirate is a new species,

725
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,950
combining advantages of men and women.

726
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,710
A better flatterer.

727
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:53,950
But Crab is not ungrateful.

728
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:55,950
There's been a misunderstanding.

729
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:57,880
Where should we go to find her?

730
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,400
Is Qin Shangcheng in the hotel?

731
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,470
He went to have lunch

732
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:02,800
when we got here.

733
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:27,710
Rong,

734
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:29,160
you didn't have lunch yet, right?

735
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:30,640
How about eating with me?

736
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:32,590
These are your favorite dishes.

737
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:34,350
It's the last meal in your life.

738
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,560
I'm not interested in it.

739
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:45,160
What happened to you?

740
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,430
Why did you become like this?

741
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,880
Stop talking rubbish!

742
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,430
Hand over the Rapier

743
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,880
or I'll kill you.

744
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:53,710
Fine.

745
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,400
Since you want the Rapier,

746
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,640
you have to tell me why.

747
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:00,800
You made Prince Mu's Residence

748
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:03,110
and hundreds of lives be in danger.

749
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:05,560
I can't kill you a hundred times.

750
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,710
Duanmu Bai played tricks for sure.

751
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,350
Okay.

752
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,710
I'll give you the Rapier

753
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,110
if you beat me.

754
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:17,880
Deal.

755
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:19,070
Don't go back on your word.

756
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,230
Qian,

757
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:32,160
My Lord is fighting with Your Highness.

758
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,400
Shall we stop them?

759
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,070
Are you stupid?

760
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,280
Why did My Lord choose Taoyuan Restaurant

761
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:39,000
although there are so many restaurants?

762
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,280
That's because My Lord and her Highness

763
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,310
met again after a long separation.

764
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:42,560
They can spend their private time

765
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,680
in such a romantic place.

766
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,590
Don't make trouble.

767
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:46,070
Just wait for instructions.

768
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,280
Got it?

769
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:47,710
You're right.

770
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:54,680
No.

771
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:55,760
I can't beat him

772
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:57,590
according to his martial arts.

773
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:59,070
I can only change my strategy.

774
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:12,470
Why did you call me Rong?

775
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:13,590
Who's she?

776
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:15,710
Rong is my wife,

777
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:19,310
and the most important person in my life.

778
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,280
I'm White Dove,

779
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,710
not Rong.

780
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,680
You're too old-fashioned

781
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,560
to cheat girls.

782
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,800
If I want to play tricks,

783
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:37,800
it's as easy as winking.

784
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,760
How dare you!

785
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,710
I'm not afraid,

786
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:45,400
but reluctant.

787
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:49,040
Let's talk some business.

788
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,520
Since you can't kill me,

789
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:52,680
and you want to take the Rapier,

790
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,190
why not make a deal?

791
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:56,760
Go ahead.

792
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,760
As long as you promise me

793
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,800
to stay with me and help me

794
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,070
become the alliance leader

795
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,040
in the selection process,

796
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,160
at that time,

797
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:06,830
I'll give you the Rapier.

798
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:08,190
Okay.

799
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,680
That's settled then.

800
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:11,560
We can sign a deed.

801
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:12,520
Never mind.

802
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:13,950
I trust you.

803
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:33,000
That's weird.

804
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:34,800
Why did My Lord let her Highness go?

805
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:37,920
My Lord decided to go slowly.

806
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:38,920
He must divine the truth

807
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,040
that her Highness has lost her memory

808
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,470
and she was made use of Duanmu Bai.

809
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:42,710
He wants to use the Conference

810
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:44,160
to help her Highness restore memory.

811
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,590
No.

812
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:47,880
Why did My Lord go with her?

813
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:48,920
Shall we go with them?

814
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,350
That's right.

815
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,470
He has let out fishing line,

816
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:53,070
so he should make the fish under control.

817
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:55,190
My Lord wants to teach Duanmu Bai a lesson.

818
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:55,950
Got it?

819
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,350
Don't worry.

820
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:59,070
Just go back to the hotel and wait.

821
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,430
You're right.

822
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:00,950
Let's go.

823
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:04,880
Don't worry, Your Highness.

824
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,880
I promised Qin Shangcheng

825
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,520
only to let down his guard.

826
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,120
Then I can watch for a chance.

827
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,710
The man is tricky.

828
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:15,800
There must be a conspiracy

829
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,040
to make you stay with him

830
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:18,710
so deliberately.

831
00:34:20,909 --> 00:34:22,320
Don't believe him.

832
00:34:24,909 --> 00:34:25,429
White Dove,

833
00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:27,080
please remember.

834
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,280
You're my fiancee.

835
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,190
The Mermaid Jade Pendant

836
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,280
is our token of love.

837
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,150
We'll get married

838
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,000
when I get the Rapier

839
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,600
and save my father.

840
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:16,470
Duanmu Bai.

841
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:29,710
Tell me.

842
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:32,360
What have you done to Rong?

843
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:34,950
Hand over the antidote.

844
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:36,800
There is no antidote

845
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,040
for amnesia in the world.

846
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:40,000
This is all your fault

847
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,390
not to protect your wife.

848
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:51,280
For the sake of you treating my eyes,

849
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,870
I won't kill you this time.

850
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,120
The Rapier is with me.

851
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,670
Take it on your own

852
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:58,870
if you're a real man.

853
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:01,630
But if you dare to do something bad to Rong,

854
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,760
I'll kill you for sure.

855
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:21,840
Oh My Lord!

856
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,040
Oh My Lord!

857
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:27,470
What's wrong with your eyes?

858
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:29,950
The mad woman did it.

859
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,630
Please avenge us, My Lord!

860
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:32,470
Beat her!

861
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:33,910
You want the other eye to be hit, right?

862
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,430
Don't move! Let me tell you,

863
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:36,360
My Lord is here.

864
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:37,520
Don't try nothing.

865
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:37,910
Yes.

866
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:42,080
What are you doing here?

867
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:43,710
I'm not in the mood to play with you today.

868
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,150
I'm not here for you,

869
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:48,470
but Crab, the sworn sister

870
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:49,120
of mine.

871
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,360
Crab?

872
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:53,710
Now, her name is

873
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:54,470
White Dove.

874
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:57,430
Go ahead.

875
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,560
I have only one question.

876
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,430
Is Crab

877
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:03,000
your wife,

878
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:03,670
Hua Rong?

879
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:07,360
Of course not.

880
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:11,190
But I heard you two call her

881
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,670
Your Highness in the

882
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:13,870
Imperial Alliance Guild Hall yesterday.

883
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:16,760
You must have heard wrong.

884
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:19,080
This is how it goes.

885
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,800
Crab may look

886
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,320
a little similar to

887
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,470
Your Highness.

888
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:25,600
Besides,

889
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:28,630
how can she try to kill her husband

890
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:30,320
if she's My Lord's wife?

891
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:32,800
Qin Shangcheng,

892
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:34,800
is that true?

893
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,600
It doesn't

894
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:37,800
really matter.

895
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:41,710
Of course it's true.

896
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,470
If you two dare to lie to me again,

897
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,800
I'll beat you up, and

898
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,150
even your mothers can't recognize you.

899
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:49,360
I'll kill you.

900
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:55,280
Qian,

901
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:56,630
why did you lie to the Hag?

902
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:58,150
Zhang,

903
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:00,840
I did it for their own good.

904
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,000
Although she's close to her Highness now,

905
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,230
she will get angry and do something bad

906
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:07,000
to her Highness if she knows

907
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:07,800
Crab is My Lord's wife.

908
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:10,080
My Lord is busy enough now.

909
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:11,390
Am I right, My Lord?

910
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:13,670
Maybe

911
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,390
Chi Hong is not as mean as you think.

912
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,120
But

913
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,710
recovering Rong's memory

914
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:20,910
is the top priority now.

915
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,670
I don't care if you sleep at night,

916
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:23,950
but you must find a way.

917
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:24,710
Do you hear me?

918
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:25,230
Yes.

919
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:52,150
Qian Dayou.

920
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,120
It seems that you've found a way

921
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,000
since you sleep so well.

922
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:11,840
Oh My Lord, you're so wise!

923
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:12,910
I've got advice

924
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:14,950
from the Duke of Zhou in dreams.

925
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:15,870
I've mastered a set of methods

926
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:17,560
to help her Highness recover her memory.

927
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,000
Minister Kong asks his men

928
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,360
to give you the assignment letter for the first round.

929
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:41,840
The former site of Imperial Alliance is located on

930
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,840
Imperial Island, 50 nautical miles east of Shengcheng.

931
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:48,280
The Imperial Island is covered with miasma.

932
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:52,870
You can land on the island safely

933
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:54,630
after drinking

934
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:55,910
Golden Wine.

935
00:39:57,470 --> 00:40:00,390
Wenren Zui, who was responsible for making it,

936
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:01,520
had passed away,

937
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:03,800
only leaving the recipe and tools.

938
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,280
He noted the cooperation

939
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,910
of men and women was needed.

940
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:10,280
The team that successfully makes the wine

941
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,320
can advance to the second round.

942
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,150
To form a team?

943
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,800
A good chance to fish for more information from Qin.

944
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,520
How to make the Golden Wine?

945
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:23,360
The letter says all we need

946
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,190
is the Imperial Eagle's Feather now.

947
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:26,280
Let's go!

948
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,470
Ask Qin Shangcheng to form a team.

949
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:28,390
Okay!

950
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:31,390
Just for an eagle's feather?

951
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,360
I don't think that's difficult.

952
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:34,560
Qian,

953
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,430
don't look down upon the Imperial Eagle.

954
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:37,710
It is said that it took

955
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:39,630
the old alliance leader three years

956
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:40,630
to tame it.

957
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,470
Now the old leader is missing.

958
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:44,390
The Imperial Eagle has no master.

959
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:45,470
It's even harder

960
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:47,080
to find the eagle.

961
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,800
I've asked my people to find it out.

962
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:50,710
Some people said they saw

963
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,080
the Imperial Eagle in Mengshan Mountain.

964
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,190
So you came here to

965
00:40:58,710 --> 00:40:59,910
form a team with me?

966
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:02,470
According to our agreement,

967
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,390
I help you become the alliance leader,

968
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:05,710
then you give me the Rapier.

969
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:07,120
As you wish.

970
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:10,910
In this way, My Lord can help

971
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:11,910
Her Highness restore her memory.

972
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,040
But according to our agreement,

973
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:17,560
you should stay with me closely

974
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:18,670
all the time

975
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:21,560
in the election process.

976
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:24,470
Don't push your luck.

977
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:25,520
Okay.

978
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,190
You don't have to be with me closely.

979
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:29,000
Just stay with me.

980
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,600
Okay?

981
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:31,390
Fine.

982
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,040
I'll move to Sheng Xin Hotel.

983
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:36,000
Okay.

984
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:36,950
Qian Dayou.

985
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,840
Rent a room

986
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,280
for White Dove

987
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,520
next to mine.

988
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:42,710
Next to yours?

989
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:44,520
Got it!

990
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:45,630
Yes, My Lord.

991
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:52,040
Your Highness,

992
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,670
we seem to be a little late.

993
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,600
Qin Shangcheng still forms a team with Crab

994
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,190
even he knows she wants to kill him.

995
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:01,320
It seemed that they didn't

996
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,430
tell the truth last night.

997
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:05,760
We can only depend on Duanmu Bai

998
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,670
if we want to find out who Crab is.

999
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:09,040
I refuse.

1000
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,600
It's your pleasure to work with me.

1001
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:12,600
Don't be arrogant!

1002
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:16,560
I mean, your 50 rules to form a team.

1003
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:17,910
I refuse.

1004
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,150
As long as you accept to work with me,

1005
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:23,120
it's not a problem for us.

1006
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:24,630
At the worst,

1007
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:25,470
I'll delete some.

1008
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:28,670
Deal!

1009
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:31,230
Wish a pleasant cooperation with you!

1010
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:53,710
Crab,

1011
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:56,000
we're leaving for Shengcheng soon.

1012
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,040
What

1013
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,040
style of makeup will

1014
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,600
King Pirate like?

1015
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,760
I never expected that

1016
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,710
you were such an authority on makeup.

1017
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:04,390
Of course.

1018
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:06,000
Although I'm considered a tomboy

1019
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,320
and fond of conquering men,

1020
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,800
I don't want to be a man.

1021
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,150
Don't you think

1022
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:12,190
it's cool to become a unique

1023
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:13,470
female pirate?

1024
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:14,360
I'd like

1025
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,870
to be an unconventional woman.

1026
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:16,840
Anyway,

1027
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:17,390
Your Highness,

1028
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,840
you're so pretty and cool

1029
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,080
when you say the words.

1030
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:21,230
By the way, Crab,

1031
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:22,000
thanks to you

1032
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,320
for becoming my unique Lucky Star of Love.

1033
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:25,910
Give me some advice.

1034
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:27,190
What kind of girls

1035
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:29,150
does King Pirate like best?

1036
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:30,760
I'm an expert at that.

1037
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,470
Since he is the unparalleled King Pirate,

1038
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:35,190
he won't like ordinary women.

1039
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:38,000
Actually, he doesn't like women

1040
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,360
who are in red,

1041
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,560
wearing too much makeup

1042
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,840
and dressing them up like us.

1043
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,800
Are you sure the King Pirate has such a bad taste?

1044
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:49,000
It's fine.

1045
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:50,840
I like to challenge

1046
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,040
the impossible.

1047
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,190
Don't worry.

1048
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:54,760
I can make him

1049
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:55,710
like our style.

1050
00:43:56,670 --> 00:43:57,120
Okay.

1051
00:43:57,870 --> 00:43:58,800
Come on, Your Highness!

1052
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,430
Come on!
