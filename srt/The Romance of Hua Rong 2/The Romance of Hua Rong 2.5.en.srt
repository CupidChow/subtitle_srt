3
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:39,509
My Lord.

4
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,870
These pirates, sticky fingers!

5
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,509
We must keep an eye on them,

6
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,630
not let anything go wrong with the Rapier.

7
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:46,910
No offense, but...

8
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,830
More care, more trouble.

9
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,479
You were too deliberate.

10
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:52,870
I'm afraid

11
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,910
we've aroused Qin Shangcheng's suspicion.

12
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:56,870
It was you...

13
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:57,910
Follow my orders next time!

14
00:01:58,509 --> 00:01:59,479
Don't take the liberty.

15
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,630
It was you let me...

16
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:04,720
What are you grumbling about?

17
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,230
Nothing.

18
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,800
I'm secretly vowing

19
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,800
to help you find the Rapier as soon as possible.

20
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:11,720
If so,

21
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,190
you can finish the task earlier

22
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,390
to find Little White Dove.

23
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:15,600
Oh.

24
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:17,720
Any clues about her?

25
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:20,750
No.

26
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,240
Your Highness.

27
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,110
The range you offered me

28
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,630
was too wide.

29
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,000
So many people all around the world.

30
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:29,440
Could it be narrowed?

31
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,079
That would make it easier

32
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:31,600
for spies to screen.

33
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,360
You are so stupid.

34
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,079
She's 19.

35
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,390
She's 19.

36
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,670
She comes from Jingcheng, Tianchu.

37
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,190
She is pure, lovely

38
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,240
and kind.

39
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:41,670
Lovely and kind.

40
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:42,520
What's more,

41
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,520
she's concerned about the country and the people.

42
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,520
She is chivalrous.

43
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,470
She is chivalrous.

44
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:47,829
Correct.

45
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:48,720
Got it.

46
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:51,030
Lovely.

47
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:51,800
Kind.

48
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:52,910
Pure.

49
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:53,880
Chivalrous.

50
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,470
I've been extremely proficient in

51
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,110
the 36 Stratagems of Mastering Husband.

52
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,800
Which one shall I choose later?

53
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,030
Honey-trap.

54
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,190
Flirting.

55
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,390
Miss Hua.

56
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:27,470
Miss Hua.

57
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:29,360
Are your eyes

58
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:30,320
okay?

59
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,390
Of course.

60
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,880
Have you seen Qin Shangcheng?

61
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:33,720
He's...

62
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:34,550
up there.

63
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,079
Oh, I'm just off.

64
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,440
That girl must not be

65
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,600
like Hua Rong.

66
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,030
Qin Shangcheng.

67
00:03:59,110 --> 00:03:59,800
Do you miss me?

68
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,550
Why doesn't this work?

69
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:11,830
Ruse of self-injury.

70
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:13,720
Cheng.

71
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,440
Cheng.

72
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,880
Ah!

73
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,480
The ground is too slippery

74
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,829
to stand on.

75
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:30,550
My "aunt",

76
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:32,760
If you have nothing to do,

77
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,920
hurry aboard and have a rest.

78
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:35,390
Don't delay the royal intermarriage.

79
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,920
Why didn't it work?

80
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,110
Fine.

81
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,760
There are 34 stratagems left for me.

82
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,600
Take it easy.

83
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,390
I can't follow you to South Desolation this time.

84
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,110
Please protect

85
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:52,000
Rong and Qin.

86
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:52,550
Trust me.

87
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,480
Oh.

88
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,760
They just got married.

89
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,270
They may not get along well.

90
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,830
Although you are not as eloquent as Qian Dayou,

91
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,640
you're still helpful

92
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,880
from your experience in marriage.

93
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,000
And

94
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,790
they...

95
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:06,440
My dear.

96
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,950
Don't you have anything to say to me?

97
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:11,720
Are you

98
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,880
jealous?

99
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,550
How time flies!

100
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,640
I still have a lot to tell you.

101
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,600
You've had swollen feet recently,

102
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:25,670
so I sewed a pair of shoes for you.

103
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,390
They're big and ugly,

104
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,200
but I hope they can make your feet comfortable.

105
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:32,480
They're not ugly at all.

106
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:34,510
They fit me whatsoever.

107
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,270
This time,

108
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,200
I can't leave

109
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,950
My Lord and the others alone anyway,

110
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:42,510
But

111
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,040
I'm still reluctant to part with you and our unborn child.

112
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,760
This is your duty.

113
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,920
I don't blame you.

114
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,640
Zhang Xian.

115
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,720
Listen up,

116
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,440
you must write me a letter at least once a day

117
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:54,950
to tell me the situation.

118
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,760
And

119
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,390
you must keep me and the child in mind

120
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,550
at any time and anywhere.

121
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,720
At last,

122
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,160
and most importantly,

123
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,670
you must protect yourself.

124
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,320
Without seeing you,

125
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,440
I won't have a baby.

126
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:18,510
Zhang Xian

127
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,270
It's about to sail.

128
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,200
We are waiting for you.

129
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,230
I owe this kiss.

130
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,550
Waiting for you.

131
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:27,160
Owe it.

132
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:27,550
Let's go.

133
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:30,480
Goodbye.

134
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:38,440
My Lord,

135
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:39,670
everything is ready.

136
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,270
Great.

137
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,200
Attention!

138
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:44,320
Weigh anchor.

139
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,110
Set sail.

140
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,040
I'm telling you,

141
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,720
My Lord's pirate ship is the world's biggest

142
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,880
and fastest wooden ship.

143
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,880
It is more than 109 feet long

144
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:32,790
and 55 feet wide,

145
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,600
and has seven masts to hang dozens of sails.

146
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:35,920
This treasure ship

147
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,760
is very tall

148
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,670
and wide.

149
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:38,640
There is a deluxe room,

150
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:39,760
with elegant decoration inside,

151
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,640
making it respectable and comfortable.

152
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,670
It used to be an exclusive room for My Lord.

153
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,350
But

154
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:45,110
considering Your Highness's hard work all the way,

155
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,230
he vacated

156
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,390
this room.

157
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,350
Thank you, Qin.

158
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:50,159
Your Highness,

159
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:51,200
please.

160
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,600
Is this what you call Deluxe Room?

161
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,320
How's it going?

162
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,070
Surprise!

163
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,350
I carried on a secret affair.

164
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,440
Am I great?

165
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:21,880
You are all here.

166
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,040
Sorry to bother you.

167
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,480
Lord Qin.

168
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,230
Miss Hua

169
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:31,320
is not married yet,

170
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,200
but she is forward.

171
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,520
It's not appropriate, is it?

172
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,470
Your Highness, don't worry.

173
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:40,110
I'll place her in the stern

174
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,760
next door to me.

175
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,640
That's good.

176
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,150
You two

177
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,030
mend the hole.

178
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,230
Holy shit.

179
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,590
I'm exhausted.

180
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:58,960
Qian Dayou,

181
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,150
it was I who fixed the hole.

182
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,670
What you did was just passed me a hammer nearby.

183
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,230
You are lost.

184
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,550
My Lord and Miss Hua give each other a silent treatment.

185
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,880
I'm fatigued.

186
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,440
Qian Dayou.

187
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:12,520
Her Highness.

188
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,440
Why do they live in the bow

189
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,470
but I live in the stern?

190
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:16,840
Here it is.

191
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,200
My lord told me,

192
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,590
you should keep a certain distance

193
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,400
from Your Highness before you marry him.

194
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,000
Because absence makes the heart grow fonder.

195
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:26,910
Follow me!

196
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:31,000
Say it!

197
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:32,790
What has Qin Shangcheng got up in his sleeve?

198
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:33,670
Your Highness.

199
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,280
My Lord

200
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,000
really loves you.

201
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,280
Qian Dayou,

202
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,150
Stop playing games with me.

203
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,910
Would you give me a break

204
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:42,960
like Zhang Xian did?

205
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:43,670
Shut up.

206
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:45,640
I'm telling you,

207
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,520
I'm in a silent treatment

208
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,640
with Qin Shangcheng

209
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,080
but lovers' quarrels

210
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,760
are soon mended.

211
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,110
So if you don't tell the truth,

212
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,080
you are casting in a bone between us.

213
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,000
Her Highness.

214
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,200
People should not destroy a marriage

215
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:57,880
no matter how.

216
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,350
Stay down.

217
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,760
Qian Dayou.

218
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,590
It's your chance!

219
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,000
If you don't help me,

220
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,710
I have no choice

221
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,400
but to play my trump card

222
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,640
against Duanmu Bai,

223
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,030
honey trap.

224
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,710
Anyway, if Qin Shangcheng

225
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:12,840
asks me then,

226
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,440
I will say, Qian Dayou taught me all.

227
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:15,590
Her highness,

228
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,670
you're trying to kill me.

229
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,550
I remember honey trap...

230
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,910
All right.

231
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,000
I'll tell you everything.

232
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:24,030
You see,

233
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:25,030
My Lord said,

234
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,440
you asked him to focus more on

235
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,400
the country

236
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,590
and the people,

237
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:29,440
and put his feelings

238
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,470
aside for the time being.

239
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:31,150
So he

240
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:32,150
was recently investigating

241
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,880
Duanmu Bai's life experience and purpose.

242
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,520
Yes,

243
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,590
he has been being

244
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,150
around you.

245
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,470
You're pissing me off.

246
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:39,440
Stay down.

247
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,910
Qin Shangcheng!

248
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:45,590
Huh, bully for you.

249
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,030
Make the psychological attack with me, isn't it?

250
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,840
This is a battle of honor about status after marriage.

251
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:53,000
I can get to the truth

252
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:54,960
by myself.

253
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:57,880
Her Highness.

254
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,470
You promised not to apply

255
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,640
the honey trap to Duanmu Bai,

256
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,710
right?

257
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:03,760
Your Highness.

258
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:04,840
Have a seat, please.

259
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,400
Look,

260
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,200
he has adopted the honey trap.

261
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,000
It is a famous tea of Tianchu,

262
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,670
Yunshan Green Tea,

263
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,150
also known as Cuiyun Green Tea.

264
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,590
I had an inkling of it.

265
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:28,550
Yunshan Green Tea can remain its

266
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,110
mellow and sweet taste for a long time.

267
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,440
And its production

268
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,640
is quite complicated.

269
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,790
After tea-leaves picking up,

270
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,030
all the remaining steps of baking and drying

271
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,200
must be fully checked.

272
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,550
This is especially true of marriage.

273
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,710
As a family member of Hua Rong,

274
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,520
I'm concerned about her of course.

275
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,470
What do you

276
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,320
think of her?

277
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:49,880
Miss Hua

278
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:51,520
is extremely talented

279
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:52,760
and extraordinary.

280
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,080
Although she is of noble birth,

281
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,200
she is not like the girls of blue blood

282
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:57,640
who are quite insipid because of

283
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,230
being confined to the boudoir for a long time,

284
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,200
and fettered by bureaucratic red tape.

285
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,440
She is being herself. Her liveliness,

286
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,400
sincerity and purity

287
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,150
fascinate me so much.

288
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:07,080
She must be my ideal wife.

289
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,110
You wanna get a word from me?

290
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:13,670
No way!

291
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,320
Qin Shangcheng must be insanely jealous now.

292
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:17,550
He deserved it.

293
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,550
With all due respect,

294
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,550
in my opinion,

295
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,840
you still have a long way to go

296
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,590
to improve your discernment in people.

297
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,790
Hua Rong

298
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:35,910
is quite opposite of

299
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:37,030
the person in your eyes.

300
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,550
Instead of seemingly gentle and lovely,

301
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,840
she is indeed explosive

302
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,230
and impulsive.

303
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,080
You're right.

304
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,710
She is not like the other girls of blue blood.

305
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:48,000
Even the housework tires her.

306
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,320
And the Fancies of Men of Letters are none of her business.

307
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:50,710
Without extraordinary men

308
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,710
this little spirited horse

309
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:53,400
Piss me off!

310
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,000
would never be tame.

311
00:12:58,670 --> 00:12:59,960
Just like this green tea,

312
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:01,400
it smells

313
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:02,640
very good,

314
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,200
but it is difficult to cater to all tastes.

315
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:05,910
So I advise you

316
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,520
not to force yourself.

317
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:12,910
Bah!

318
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:14,880
Qin Shangcheng!

319
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,280
How dare you compare me to the green tea!

320
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Never mind, Your Highness.

321
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,470
My "nephew"

322
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:38,150
is just

323
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,000
pulling a stunt.

324
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,110
Yunshan Green Tea is good in nature.

325
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,910
But the tea making is also important.

326
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:43,880
The tea-leaves need boiling water flowing down

327
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,550
from high to make them rise and fall three times.

328
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,400
Only in this way,

329
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,350
will the taste be released.

330
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,400
Otherwise,

331
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,960
it will be bitter and astringent.

332
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,400
Someone just turned the problem

333
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,280
of no knowledge of tea-making himself

334
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,520
into tea-leaves.

335
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,710
It's ridiculous.

336
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,350
Your Highness, please

337
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:58,640
have a try at the tea I made.

338
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:01,670
My "aunt", you are just in time.

339
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,550
I'm gonna monitor the course.

340
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,760
So you

341
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,320
can have tea with Your Highness.

342
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,320
Your Highness, never mind.

343
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:12,760
Please.

344
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:14,280
Thank you.

345
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:28,150
Miss Hua,

346
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,230
how can it

347
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:30,840
be so bitter?

348
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:31,910
Bitter?

349
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,640
This is Hui's anti-abortion soup.

350
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,760
Qin Shangcheng!

351
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,440
You messed with me again!

352
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,110
My Lord, why did you help Duanmu Bai

353
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,030
count treasure boxes?

354
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:04,960
Zhang Xian,

355
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:06,230
you're really

356
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:07,760
not all there.

357
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,150
The purpose of what My Lord did is to

358
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,200
determine whether Duanmu Bai

359
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,910
wants all boxes

360
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,230
or just one of them.

361
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:14,590
Can get all the boxes

362
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:15,470
but only get one of them?

363
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:16,710
Is he stupid?

364
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:17,280
You still don't believe it.

365
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:20,000
When Dayou counted the boxes,

366
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,710
Lan Tian said clearly that

367
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,280
they must remain the whole.

368
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,710
By inference,

369
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:26,150
what Duanmu Bai wants

370
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,670
is probably just

371
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,080
a piece in those boxes.

372
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,880
So as long as we figure it out,

373
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,910
we can prevent him

374
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:35,200
from absconding with the piece stolen.

375
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,440
absconding? Wouldn't that be better?

376
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,000
In that case,

377
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,280
Her Highness won't have to marry him.

378
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,200
Zhang Xian,

379
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,470
the royal marriage is a bargaining chip

380
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:42,880
to force South Desolation to retreat.

381
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,790
If Duanmu Bai absconds,

382
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:44,230
how...

383
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:45,230
will the retreat go?

384
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,710
My Lord intends to

385
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:48,840
stop the marriage,

386
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,710
but proceed the retreat at the same time.

387
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:50,400
So we need to find out

388
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,150
what South Desolation desires for.

389
00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:59,110
My Lord.

390
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:05,910
Good night, Her Highness.

391
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:07,760
Be careful.

392
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,320
Is he crazy?

393
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:12,880
Give me the treasure list.

394
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,280
My "aunt", what do you wanna do?

395
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:18,400
For my dowries,

396
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,640
a clear head is needed.

397
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,710
You wanna lure Duanmu Bai

398
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:23,590
with the list, right?

399
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,520
Your words of caring for Tianchu and the people

400
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,110
remain engraved on my memory.

401
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:29,520
Just leave this

402
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,400
arduous task with me.

403
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,110
Why are you still angry?

404
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:43,030
Qin Shangcheng.

405
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:45,110
You agreed to put aside personal feelings.

406
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,000
Why do you act indecently?

407
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,150
I'm just going to bed.

408
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,230
Come together?

409
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:55,790
It is said in the book,

410
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,280
in a clash between a couple,

411
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,350
if you are not in a dominant position,

412
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,110
you should learn to take the initiative

413
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,400
and firmly grasp the situation in your own hands.

414
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:03,910
Yep.

415
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:32,230
So what you covet is

416
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:33,640
not only my body

417
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,070
but also something else.

418
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,920
I want both.

419
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:38,950
Good night.

420
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,430
I'll give it back to you when I'm done.

421
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,800
It seems that only Her Highness

422
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,950
can make My Lord suffer.

423
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:59,430
She won this time.

424
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:00,230
But I'm sure

425
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:02,160
My Lord must be well prepared for a counterattack.

426
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,430
What are you talking about?

427
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:04,800
Come in.

428
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:07,680
Let's go.

429
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,280
Zhang Xian.

430
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:14,190
You...

431
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:18,640
My Lord.

432
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,110
My Lord.

433
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,640
Any orders?

434
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:23,680
Change course now.

435
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,110
Land in Hai City tomorrow morning.

436
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,110
Why?

437
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,590
You fool!

438
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,800
My Lord must have thought of

439
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,280
a plan to deal with Duanmu Bai

440
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,680
and tame our sister-in-law.

441
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,560
Right, My Lord?

442
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,880
How's the thing

443
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:34,880
I told you going?

444
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,430
Your satisfaction is guaranteed.

445
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,590
Well done.

446
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,710
Learn to read maps well.

447
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:42,950
Learn to read maps well.

448
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,430
Where are we?

449
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:52,950
Your Highness.

450
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,040
I heard, the envoy

451
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,070
will land in Hai City tomorrow

452
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:56,830
and make the journey by land.

453
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,710
Besides, Qin and Hua continuously flew a kite.

454
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,070
So, I believe

455
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:02,280
they are ramping up to something.

456
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,680
Maybe, they have known that

457
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:08,800
the marriage was just a matter of expediency.

458
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,760
So they are in search of the truth.

459
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:17,430
Or maybe

460
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,400
they realized that

461
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,470
we are here for the treasure.

462
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,160
And they want to identify the piece we want.

463
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,350
So what do they want?

464
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,350
Me.

465
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,230
Sure.

466
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,040
She

467
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,800
likes me.

468
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:42,040
Think back carefully.

469
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,830
Before boarding the ship,

470
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:45,470
she made eyes

471
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:46,950
at me.

472
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,070
Afterwards,

473
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,830
she even holed the wall

474
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:53,280
wanting to contact me privately.

475
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,350
Exactly.

476
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:01,470
If these two stories are not sufficient,

477
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,760
this cup of tea she made

478
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,160
has revealed

479
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,400
her heart.

480
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:10,800
Your Highness, but

481
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,230
this tea

482
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:13,950
is extremely bitter and unpalatable.

483
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:15,950
Lan Tian.

484
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:17,190
Don't judge a book

485
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,710
by its surface.

486
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:20,520
This...

487
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:22,310
This is the red bean.

488
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,400
Yes.

489
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,000
This tea

490
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,520
was brewing in boiling water with red beans in.

491
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,520
Despite a clumsy tactic of choosing these beans

492
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:32,190
it was a symbol of her lovesickness.

493
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:35,000
Thus, she likes me very much.

494
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,040
Got it.

495
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,230
Got it completely.

496
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,920
No wonder

497
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,070
Qin Shangcheng held a diametrically opposed attitude.

498
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,230
So, the great enthusiasm

499
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:44,040
he showed

500
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:46,400
is used to please you for his "aunt".

501
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:47,310
Unfortunately.

502
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:49,830
They're just in vain.

503
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,560
So you're going to...

504
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,400
Right.

505
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,880
As long as I win Hua Rong over,

506
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,680
I will succeed.

507
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:24,950
Yunhua Yard.

508
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:26,040
Your Highness.

509
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,430
Recently, I observed the sky at night,

510
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,000
and speculated

511
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,350
there would be heavy rain at sea.

512
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,560
So I took the initiative to

513
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,680
change the itinerary.

514
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,230
Please forgive me.

515
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:37,470
A storm may arise from a clear sky.

516
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:39,400
Qin can take precautions.

517
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,560
That's excellent.

518
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,880
My Lord

519
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,280
in order to make Your Highness live comfortably,

520
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,070
spent a lot of money

521
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,350
to buy this yard.

522
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,000
Qin, I'm sorry

523
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:49,710
for the trouble.

524
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:52,280
Your Highness, please take a rest.

525
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,400
Please.

526
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:01,800
How dare he look at Her Highness!

527
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,280
Stop!

528
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:05,470
Explain it.

529
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,160
Her Highness,

530
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,350
you don't know something.

531
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,470
You're totally right.

532
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:11,230
Now look at this plaque.

533
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,000
Yunhua Yard.

534
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:14,760
This is named by My Lord personally,

535
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:17,160
which means Swordman Yunhe and Swordwoman Huahua.

536
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,190
He is trying to please you.

537
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,920
Don't act dumb.

538
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,560
Qin Shangcheng suddenly changed the route

539
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,000
and bought Yunhua Yard.

540
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:25,880
There must be a plan.

541
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:26,800
Tell the truth.

542
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,400
Her Highness,

543
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,760
I swear to God,

544
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,590
I really don't know anything this time.

545
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:33,760
Goodbye.

546
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:38,400
Forget it.

547
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,350
Whatever his plan is,

548
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:42,470
I can handle it.

549
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,310
Miss Hua.

550
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,590
Your Highness just needs your help

551
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:09,280
with something.

552
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,590
I just have a rough idea of them.

553
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,400
Duanmu.

554
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,310
I didn't expect your interest

555
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:18,830
in weapons and antiques.

556
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,950
What a coincidence.

557
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:20,590
I

558
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:22,310
have been with my father since I was a child,

559
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,710
so I'm half an expert under his influence.

560
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,310
You come from the family of generals,

561
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,040
so you are the best choice.

562
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,230
I didn't know what to do,

563
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,830
but he came to me.

564
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
God blesses me!

565
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:35,350
She has been indeed blinded

566
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,400
by unrequited love.

567
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,640
She took the bait.

568
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:01,430
My Lord.

569
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,000
My Lord.

570
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,760
Your Highness is so careless.

571
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,920
No guards posted outside his room.

572
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,800
In his opinion,

573
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:14,110
everything is in place.

574
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,350
But we can get more

575
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,640
from some clues.

576
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:25,230
Get to know this person better

577
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,470
through his personal belongings,

578
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:27,560
right, My Lord?

579
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:39,800
My Lord,

580
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,400
is it

581
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,280
the Sea Fluorescent Powder

582
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,040
that Miss Hua used before?

583
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,070
It flashes blue light

584
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:48,430
when it meets water in the dark.

585
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,920
It seems what he wants

586
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,520
is in this box.

587
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,230
Your Highness.

588
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,520
If you have something you like,

589
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,310
just tell me.

590
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:24,310
I will give it to you in advance.

591
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,070
This sandalwood board is good.

592
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,520
The regular script above

593
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:32,400
should be carved

594
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,520
by Liao Yingzhi, a famous calligrapher.

595
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,070
Have a look.

596
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,230
Make a feint to the East but attack in the west?

597
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,040
Later, I'll let you know

598
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,310
how powerful Truth Spicy is.

599
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,830
Your Highness.

600
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:51,950
You really have good taste.

601
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:54,310
I heard, this sandalwood board

602
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:56,400
is made of century-old sandalwood,

603
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,350
so its fragrance lasts forever.

604
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:58,950
Your Highness,

605
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,280
do you wanna smell it?

606
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,310
Yeah.

607
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,110
Smell it.

608
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,880
It's really fragrant

609
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,950
and refreshing.

610
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,800
And this sweet but not greasy taste

611
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,590
really matches you.

612
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,560
Smell it.

613
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,160
Excuse me, Your Highness.

614
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,070
I'm allergic to it.

615
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:28,640
Why hasn't the drug worked?

616
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,950
Is it not strong enough?

617
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:33,760
Are you looking for Truth Spicy?

618
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:45,800
My Lord.

619
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:52,710
Rong.

620
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:53,710
My "aunt".

621
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:54,070
Rong.

622
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:55,640
Your Highness.

623
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,230
Are you all right?

624
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:56,830
I'm fine.

625
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,310
You...

626
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:03,190
What did you do to her?

627
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,000
You should ask Miss Hua.

628
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,710
Truth Spicy

629
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:10,040
is only a small trick for me.

630
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:10,880
Let's go.

631
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:17,190
My Lord.

632
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,560
I don't need to teach you

633
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,520
what to do next, right?

634
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:20,880
Nope.

635
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:26,110
Got it?

636
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:26,760
Yep.

637
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,590
Why do I spray it

638
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:36,350
but you sprinkle it?

639
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:37,920
Because you spray it well.

640
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,430
Qin Shangcheng.

641
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,760
Don't you go.

642
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:16,760
Don't be angry with me, will you?

643
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:31,680
You will wake up

644
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:34,710
two hours after being poisoned.

645
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,230
Have a good rest.

646
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:45,190
You left me alone the day after our wedding.

647
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,280
You don't even know how much I missed you

648
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,950
and needed you.

649
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,230
You told me

650
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:56,160
you'd show up as soon as I rang the bell,

651
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:00,040
but you kept me waiting for you all night.

652
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:02,470
You badly liar.

653
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:10,310
How could I lie to you?

654
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,000
I heard the bell.

655
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,350
I was always by your side.

656
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,350
My love.

657
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,070
Fortunately, I took the antidote in advance.

658
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:28,000
Stop.

659
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:29,560
Something happened.

660
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,400
Fire!

661
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,000
Come on! Put out the fire!

662
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,280
Come on!

663
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,760
Something happened.

664
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,110
Fire!

665
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:40,350
Lan Tian, what happened?

666
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:42,350
Your Highness and I were walking in the garden.

667
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:42,680
This way.

668
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,640
We saw smoke billowing here.

669
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,950
The guards were gone.

670
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:45,400
Just stop.

671
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,280
Hurry up to put out the fire.

672
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:47,680
My "aunt".

673
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,590
What's wrong?

674
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:49,350
I just went to the bathroom.

675
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:50,040
Why is it on fire?

676
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:50,350
Don't ask.

677
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,310
Hurry up to put out the fire.

678
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:52,000
Be safe.

679
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:53,830
This way.

680
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:55,070
This box, please.

681
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:55,800
Be careful. Slow down.

682
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:58,040
Duanmu Bai.

683
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:00,800
Did he set the fire?

684
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:05,800
Dear friends.

685
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:07,160
Count the treasure boxes.

686
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:14,000
It's done.

687
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:15,280
There are four missing.

688
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,590
Flint powder was also found.

689
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,190
Your Highness.

690
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:25,190
Did you find the Rapier?

691
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,230
The box I marked has gone.

692
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,040
How?

693
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:38,280
Say it.

694
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,760
Did you steal the boxes?

695
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:40,590
How dare you!

696
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,760
How dare you slander Your Highness!

697
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,760
Do you recognize this?

698
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:50,110
This is flint powder.

699
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,070
You mean, the fire didn't happen by chance?

700
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,350
Correct.

701
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,470
And Zhang Xian also suspected,

702
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,950
Your Highness risked fighting the fire

703
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:00,680
was nothing but a self-play.

704
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,000
Do you feel the same way?

705
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,680
How could I?

706
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,800
Sooner or later, all my dowries

707
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,560
will be yours.

708
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,470
You won't make an unnecessary move.

709
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:12,830
But, this is

710
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,520
a matter of peace between the two countries.

711
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:16,640
And we have to give the emperor an account.

712
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,470
So we still have to bother you

713
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:19,470
to come with us

714
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:20,880
to cooperate with our investigation, so that

715
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,680
we can help you clear your suspicion, right?

716
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,070
Guards, come in!

717
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:25,070
Aye.

718
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,070
How dare you!

719
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,400
Stop it.

720
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,680
My Lord.

721
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:41,760
The fire

722
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:43,400
has nothing to do with Your Highness.

723
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,110
I don't know.

724
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,430
Here's the story.

725
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,950
When My Lord found out about the fire,

726
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,680
he felt something was wrong.

727
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,040
He dashed out.

728
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,070
Sure enough,

729
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:56,800
He found a group of men in black

730
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,040
running with our treasure boxes.

731
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,760
He quickly went after them.

732
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,680
They escaped by sheer fluke,

733
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,400
but,

734
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,640
we've got it!

735
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,190
The token of the Qing Hong Gang.

736
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,280
This matter is purely a misunderstanding.

737
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,520
Here I

738
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,710
apologize to Your Highness.

739
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:14,880
What's done is done.

740
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,920
The boxes have been lost.

741
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,710
Qin,

742
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,230
as the head of the envoy,

743
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:22,350
should give an account.

744
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:25,800
I hereby swear,

745
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:27,310
within three days,

746
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:29,470
I'm bound to take all the boxes back.

747
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,590
That's best.

748
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,190
Let's go.

749
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:40,640
Rong.

750
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:41,280
In fact...

751
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,070
What?

752
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,680
You don't have to say anything.

753
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,920
I don't care.

754
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,190
And nothing matters.

755
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:53,350
My Lord.

756
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:55,000
What matters?

757
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,430
My Lord.

758
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:57,760
Pursuing our sister-in-law matters.

759
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:58,590
My Lord.

760
00:33:58,590 --> 00:33:59,710
That's right.

761
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:00,160
Shut up.

762
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:02,110
My Lord.

763
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:03,470
I'm here.

764
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,040
Why hasn't he come yet?

765
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:19,040
Beat it!

766
00:34:19,469 --> 00:34:21,280
Absence makes the heart grow fonder, right?

767
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:23,040
Is that enough?

768
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,600
But I think

769
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,760
it doesn't work now.

770
00:34:33,469 --> 00:34:35,520
Don't think I can forgive you

771
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,600
by your a few words of love.

772
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,949
My dear, you are so angry

773
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,909
that you become a kitten.

774
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,080
Let me comfort you.

775
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:44,389
No.

776
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,469
You said, what women say is

777
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,429
the opposite of what they think.

778
00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:53,469
So...

779
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,600
So this time,

780
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,190
do I understand?

781
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:01,600
Huh.

782
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,280
Pretty much.

783
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:04,320
But

784
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:06,520
I am not a kitten now,

785
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:09,430
I am

786
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,630
a stray cat

787
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,910
that no one loves.

788
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:16,630
So I'll adopt you, okay?

789
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:19,710
This answer is not very good.

790
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:20,360
Once again.

791
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:26,230
I got it.

792
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:29,150
As long as we are together,

793
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:30,520
everywhere is our home.

794
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:33,000
You are not a homeless stray cat.

795
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,360
We are a loving couple.

796
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,430
That's right.

797
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:41,520
Rong.

798
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:46,520
I didn't do well before.

799
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:48,670
I shouldn't have snubbed you on purpose.

800
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:50,600
So,

801
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:51,870
I promise,

802
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,230
if there are any problems in the future,

803
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:54,430
we will solve them as soon as possible.

804
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,670
We don't have overnight feuds, okay?

805
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,950
Because of your sincerity,

806
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,280
I'll forgive you.

807
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:04,040
Great.

808
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:06,360
You must have had a hard day today.

809
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:07,950
Shall I give you a massage

810
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:08,670
to relieve your fatigue?

811
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:10,870
I want your massage on the Hegu point

812
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:11,950
and my head.

813
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,520
You made me have a headache.

814
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:14,560
No problem.

815
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,190
It's all up to you.

816
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:20,560
Take it easy.

817
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:36,040
The 36 Stratagems of Mastering Husband

818
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:38,080
really works.

819
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,390
So

820
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,190
although Duanmu Bai set the fire,

821
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:46,120
Qian Dayou stole the treasure boxes.

822
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:48,150
You

823
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:49,600
cheated Duanmu Bai?

824
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:52,520
So smart you are.

825
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,040
I can't hide

826
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,190
my small trick from you.

827
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,010
There are many weapons

828
00:36:58,010 --> 00:36:59,190
and antiques in all the original boxes.

829
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,230
It is impossible to tell which one

830
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:02,670
Duanmu Bai wants.

831
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,800
So I let Qian Dayou

832
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,470
steal the No.4 box he marked,

833
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:07,870
and make it a bait.

834
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:09,870
What's next?

835
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:10,840
It's Zhang Xian

836
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,520
and Qian Dayou's turn.

837
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,320
And now, there are more important things waiting for us.

838
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,040
What?

839
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,150
You forgot?

840
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,470
We haven't had a honeymoon yet.

841
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,560
So you came to Hai City

842
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,560
on purpose to...

843
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:24,390
Yep.

844
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,670
This is the honeymoon

845
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,150
I arranged for you.

846
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,040
What are you doing?

847
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:33,150
No.

848
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:48,470
Your Highness.

849
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,670
Why are you still free to feed pigeons here?

850
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:53,560
I feel wronged for you.

851
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,840
You have never been so humiliated.

852
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,080
A great man knows when to yield and when not.

853
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:00,150
Don't worry about temporary gains and losses.

854
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,760
You are really broad-minded.

855
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,000
I learned.

856
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:07,710
But,

857
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,120
Hua Rong

858
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,150
is so strange.

859
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:11,470
She argued for you for a while,

860
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:12,670
and then turned against you.

861
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,320
She blows hot and cold.

862
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,470
That's her way of drawing my attention.

863
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:18,910
She thinks that

864
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,470
will make me infatuated with her.

865
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:23,560
It's ridiculous.

866
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:26,000
She was really wrong.

867
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,360
Little White Dove

868
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,910
is the only one who can attract you

869
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:30,670
in the world.

870
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:31,950
Oh.

871
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,800
Is something new with her?

872
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:36,040
Not yet.

873
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,230
Don't worry.

874
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,150
The spies who were sent to Jingcheng, Tianchu

875
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,390
this time are all masters.

876
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,080
I believe there will be news soon.

877
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:44,870
Any clues about the treasure boxes?

878
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,670
Nothing.

879
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:48,800
In my opinion,

880
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,560
it's probably Qin Shangcheng

881
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,470
stole money in his trust,

882
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:52,710
trying to bring us to the lure.

883
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:55,600
It seems that

884
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:58,360
we have to start with the Qing Hong Gang.

885
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:31,040
Your Highness.

886
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:33,840
Your flute sounds melodious.

887
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:35,910
There is a feeling of missing in it.

888
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,190
You're

889
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:38,710
missing Little White Dove, aren't you?

890
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:41,800
I'm afraid of

891
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,910
lovesickness,

892
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,560
but I can't help it.

893
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,470
Don't worry.

894
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:48,150
I've already sent someone to hunt for her.

895
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,520
But,

896
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:51,080
are you really not afraid,

897
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,390
the person you miss is not the one in your heart,

898
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:54,630
making your yearning in vain?

899
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:56,390
What do you mean?

900
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,320
I heard,

901
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,800
recently, many young men and women

902
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:02,190
like to be connected through letters.

903
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:03,670
That is, the two never met

904
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:05,190
express their love in the letters.

905
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,390
But when they meet, they often realize that

906
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:08,190
the other person is not the loved one.

907
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:09,560
They really regret it.

908
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,230
It is commonly known as

909
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,470
Disappointment in Reality.

910
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:13,870
Nowadays, these people

911
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,870
over-beautify themselves in their letters

912
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,520
regardless of the actual situation,

913
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,190
resulting in a psychological gap.

914
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:21,150
How can they be compared with Little White Dove?

915
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:24,430
From the letters between her and her mother,

916
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:26,520
I can see, as her name suggests,

917
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,360
she is as pure and lovely as a dove,

918
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,360
and she is concerned about the world

919
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,040
and yearns for peace.

920
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,280
Your Highness.

921
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:36,600
What's the matter?

922
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,950
This health-preserving tea is brewed by Miss Hua.

923
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:42,710
Please do have a taste.

924
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:56,760
Is it that bad?

925
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:07,230
Go!
