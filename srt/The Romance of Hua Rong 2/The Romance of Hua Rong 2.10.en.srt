3
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:48,800
Bravo!

4
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,630
Bravo!

5
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:51,270
Bravo!

6
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,509
Watch this!

7
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:53,440
Bravo!

8
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:54,800
Look at that!

9
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:03,040
Welcome to the annual Dawn Festival.

10
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,190
This year,

11
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:07,000
we are glad to have General Hua Jr.

12
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,550
and Duanmu the heir here

13
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,389
to spread spices

14
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:11,600
and pray for everyone.

15
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,360
The people of both countries

16
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,829
on the border

17
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,440
have been suffering since the war.

18
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,320
The royal intermarriage between Tianchu

19
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,440
and South Desolation will benefit all.

20
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,600
Although I'm not

21
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,000
a Tianchu native,

22
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,320
I've been living here

23
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,910
for ten years.

24
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,670
The folk customs are attractive

25
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:36,079
and people are simple and sincere.

26
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:38,630
I've taken it as my second hometown.

27
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,630
I hereby sincerely hope that

28
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,240
Tianchu and South Desolation

29
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,550
can keep the peace

30
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:44,520
and all of us

31
00:02:44,829 --> 00:02:46,270
cannot be troubled by wars.

32
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,550
Well said!

33
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,520
Bravo!

34
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,520
It seems that the royal intermarriage

35
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,160
is not only what we wish,

36
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:54,960
but also the wish

37
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,190
of the Heir.

38
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,520
Well said!

39
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,360
Bravo!

40
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,190
Bravo!

41
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,910
It's so weird that Qin left us and acted alone.

42
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,670
What happened to him?

43
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:19,880
Qin?

44
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,270
Qin!

45
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,030
Oh, it's you.

46
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:34,720
In the midst of the crowd,

47
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:35,960
you found me,

48
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:36,829
and I

49
00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:38,320
found my right girl.

50
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,960
How can you see "the crowd"?

51
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:43,520
Qian,

52
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,750
why do you dress like this?

53
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,360
It's unsuitable.

54
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,440
Ling,

55
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,240
for a long time,

56
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,270
I've been wandering that

57
00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:55,360
why do I always want to talk nonsense with you,

58
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,960
though I'm slow at speech.

59
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,520
Until yesterday,

60
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,630
your words woke me up.

61
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,030
Shall I compare thee to a glass of strong wine?

62
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,080
Drinking it

63
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,360
makes me drunk,

64
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:07,360
but if I don't drink it,

65
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,030
it is difficult to solve the sorrow.

66
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,440
Ling.

67
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:18,350
My Lord,

68
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,000
Qian is wearing your clothes

69
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,230
and has imitated your hairstyle.

70
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:22,880
Now he is

71
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,200
flattering the princess downstairs.

72
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,670
He must have forgotten our business!

73
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,390
Leave him alone.

74
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,070
Keep observing.

75
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,070
Okay.

76
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,110
General Hua Jr. and Duanmu the heir,

77
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:43,320
please leave your handprints

78
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,270
on the scroll painting.

79
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:51,110
What's the matter, Miss Hua?

80
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,760
Are you

81
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,480
uncomfortable?

82
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:54,790
Take it easy.

83
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,270
After getting married,

84
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,510
you will often be present at such events.

85
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,000
You can get used to it soon.

86
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,510
You won't fall in love me, will you?

87
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:05,600
Please.

88
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:19,600
Now, let's welcome

89
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,350
General Hua Jr. and Duanmu the heir

90
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,950
to spread spices for us.

91
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:26,000
Bravo!

92
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,200
Bravo!

93
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,830
Now I announce

94
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:35,159
the opening of

95
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:36,440
the Dawn Festival.

96
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:57,110
Your Highness,

97
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,720
what's this?

98
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,200
You will get it soon.

99
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,760
Does he want to use this scroll painting

100
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,070
to confess to me?

101
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,550
Just like Jin Yiwen?

102
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:09,880
No,

103
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,830
I have to escape in a while.

104
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:11,640
Miss Hua,

105
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:12,920
what's wrong?

106
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,510
What a spectacle!

107
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,270
Though it's somewhat dazzling.

108
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,640
Calm down, Miss Hua.

109
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,790
A bigger surprise

110
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:23,830
is yet to come.

111
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:27,600
Bravo!

112
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,070
Bravo!

113
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,760
Bravo!

114
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:39,000
General Hua Jr. and Duanmu the heir,

115
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,110
please pray for us!

116
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,440
Bravo！

117
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,070
My Lord,

118
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,440
that's something strange.

119
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,670
There are a few people

120
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:22,790
who have been watching Her Highness.

121
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:25,070
These people must come here for Rong.

122
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,350
Their purpose

123
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,880
is to destroy the royal intermarriage.

124
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,390
You call on Dayou

125
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,790
and kill them.

126
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,390
Got it.

127
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,200
Remember to

128
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,510
be careful

129
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,070
and don't cause a panic in the crowd.

130
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:38,720
Okay.

131
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,320
Bravo!

132
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:43,920
Princess!

133
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:45,350
Princess!

134
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,230
I'm going to

135
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,550
do something very important right now.

136
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:47,920
Can you

137
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,670
wait for me here?

138
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:49,720
I'll take you to meet My Lord, okay?

139
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,510
What's the matter?

140
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,880
Don't ask.

141
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,390
Hurry up.

142
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:53,159
It's dangerous.

143
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,280
General,

144
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,000
there are some troublemakers.

145
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:37,470
Bravo!

146
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:48,880
Hey,

147
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,230
who sent you here?

148
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,760
He's killed!

149
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,200
No,

150
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,110
nothing happened!

151
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:03,030
He's okay!

152
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:03,880
He's okay!

153
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,440
Calm down!

154
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,840
Rose oil, jasmine extract, and narcissus absolute.

155
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,840
Calm down!

156
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:19,110
- Don't panic!
- My Lord!

157
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,030
- My Lord!
- Don't panic!

158
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,470
Hua Rong!

159
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,150
My Lord!

160
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,710
He's killed!

161
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,960
Agarwood, andalwood...

162
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:02,110
Rong,

163
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,230
where are you?

164
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:16,150
Let's go.

165
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,230
It was my poor guarding

166
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:25,080
that caused this disaster.

167
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:26,910
I beg your pardon, General.

168
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:29,320
It's not your fault.

169
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:31,520
We were assassinated  in Hai City.

170
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,150
It's a pity that these people committed suicide,

171
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,550
otherwise I must find out who is behind it.

172
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,550
It's a pity that the Dawn Festival was ruined.

173
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:40,470
I must let my...

174
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,710
Let them pay for it.

175
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,590
My Lord had expected that they would do it,

176
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,030
but he didn't

177
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:51,840
expect this kind of result.

178
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:53,840
Zhang Xian,

179
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,710
help the Vice-City Keeper

180
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:57,670
to appease the people

181
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:58,760
and treat the wounded.

182
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,440
Come on.

183
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,550
It's almost dawn.

184
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,080
I wanna take you somewhere.

185
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,030
Okay.

186
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,000
Where are you going?

187
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,030
I'm in.

188
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:16,520
Princess,

189
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,150
I think,

190
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:18,760
you'd better

191
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,520
go back to the General's Residence now.

192
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,350
You wanna defy my order?

193
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,150
No,

194
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:25,230
just think your dress

195
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:25,840
is a little

196
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,710
out of place.

197
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:27,550
You can change another one.

198
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:28,960
Get out of my way!

199
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,030
Your gilt hairpin is dirty.

200
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,110
Why not mop it?

201
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,440
Get away!

202
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:54,200
My Lord.

203
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,320
Where's Hua Rong?

204
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,640
Miss Hua went to

205
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,910
the top of the mountain with Qin Shangcheng.

206
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:02,550
My Lord!

207
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:05,030
Wait.

208
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,590
The sunrise here is really beautiful.

209
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,760
Qin Shangcheng,

210
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,200
how did you find me?

211
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,470
I found you

212
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:40,590
by smelling your fragrance.

213
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:42,840
Don't be naughty.

214
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,400
How did you find this place?

215
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,790
So beautiful.

216
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:52,110
Yep?

217
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,910
The air is so fresh.

218
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:17,670
Qin Shangcheng,

219
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,230
your eyes...

220
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:23,790
What did you see?

221
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:29,080
I saw a lady more beautiful than the sunrise.

222
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,110
Qin Shangcheng,

223
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,840
you've recovered!

224
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,150
I guessed the beginning,

225
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:04,790
but I not the end.

226
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,150
My well-prepared confession

227
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:10,200
was cut off by Rong.

228
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:14,960
Well,

229
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:16,760
you...

230
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,840
You can never touch someone who doesn't love you,

231
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,150
just like

232
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,320
you can't wake one who is pretending to be asleep.

233
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,080
It's similar.

234
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,910
You have already known that?

235
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:26,640
Actually,

236
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,880
My Lord and Her Highness

237
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,280
are already married.

238
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:31,840
Just for the sake of the goodness of the country,

239
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,840
they had to hide the marriage.

240
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,230
Hide the marriage?

241
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:35,760
Yep.

242
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,230
You know,

243
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:39,030
it's very complicated.

244
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:39,880
I'll tell you

245
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,670
the detail later.

246
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:41,440
Can you...

247
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,280
Can you stop crying?

248
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,590
Rong and Qin

249
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:51,910
have sacrificed so much for the people of Tianchu.

250
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:53,790
I didn't know that...

251
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,400
I also interfered with their plans

252
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,030
for my own selfish desire.

253
00:14:58,710 --> 00:14:59,590
I'm really glad

254
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:00,880
you can think so.

255
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,710
Now that you've let go of your obsession,

256
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,590
there is something

257
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,640
I must tell you.

258
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,400
Actually, it was me who

259
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,440
asked My Lord

260
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:14,550
to send you the gilt hairpin.

261
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,230
Good job.

262
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:20,670
I treat you as a eunuch,

263
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,150
but you want to be my husband?

264
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:25,000
Ling,

265
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:27,960
Actually I,

266
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:29,710
I,

267
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:30,550
I,

268
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:31,200
I,

269
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:32,000
I...

270
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:34,910
I just...

271
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:35,550
You know,

272
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,400
I just admire your indomitable will,

273
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,590
and want to be your guardian

274
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,280
for a lifetime.

275
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,670
I hope you can

276
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:45,960
marry a man

277
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:47,400
you love.

278
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,000
Got it.

279
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,110
You're so considerate.

280
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,960
Well, I won't treat you as a eunuch from now on.

281
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,150
I'll give you a new title,

282
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:58,760
my plaything.

283
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,230
What? Plaything?

284
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:03,590
Playmate.

285
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,840
Playmate.

286
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,960
Didn't we bother you?

287
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,150
Rong.

288
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:10,400
My Lord,

289
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:13,960
My Lord.

290
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,400
My Lord, you can see me!

291
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,760
So the first man

292
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,350
you saw was me?

293
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:19,320
Since then, I've left

294
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,670
an indelible impression in your heart.

295
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:22,710
Go back.

296
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:28,960
Rong,

297
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,200
now I know the relationship

298
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,280
between Qin and you.

299
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:34,520
I can be attracted,

300
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,590
and I can also control my love.

301
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:37,840
I will never destroy others' family.

302
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:39,550
From now on, if Duanmu Bai bullies you again,

303
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:40,280
just tell me

304
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,440
and I'll give them a lesson.

305
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:42,200
And I.

306
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:43,910
That's a minor matter.

307
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:44,910
Can you take your clothes off?

308
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:46,470
Don't I look good in this?

309
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:49,840
Today it's really dangerous.

310
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,080
Fortunately, you arrived in time

311
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,200
to catch up with this last moment.

312
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:58,280
It must be Qin Shangcheng who deliberately

313
00:16:58,590 --> 00:16:59,840
stole the thunder that you prepared

314
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,670
for Little White Dove.

315
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:03,910
As long as we reach South Desolation,

316
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:07,880
no one can take away Little White Dove.

317
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:09,760
You see,

318
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,640
he bullies me.

319
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:20,069
Rong,

320
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:21,160
I heard that

321
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,829
there were killers

322
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:23,760
in the Dawn Festival last night.

323
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,349
Are you all right?

324
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,920
I'm fine, uncle.

325
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,160
What's up with my dad?

326
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,280
How is he?

327
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,000
At present,

328
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,760
although the war has eased

329
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,710
slightly due to the royal intermarriage,

330
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:34,040
General Hua still

331
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,000
guards the front line to ensure people's safety.

332
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:38,000
The situation

333
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,470
is turbulent,

334
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,110
and court and commoners of South Desolation

335
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,280
is simmering.

336
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:44,880
I'm afraid that the accident in the Dawn Festival

337
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,830
is inseparable from the royal intermarriage.

338
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,640
In order to prevent more accidents,

339
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,190
we have to set off for South Desolation

340
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,040
as soon as possible.

341
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:51,950
Okay.

342
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:53,920
By the way,

343
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:55,400
this time, His Majesty

344
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,800
ordered us

345
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,280
to sign

346
00:17:58,590 --> 00:17:59,350
a truce contract

347
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,590
and persuade them to retreat.

348
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:02,160
We have to bring the emperor's son-in-law

349
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,800
to Tianchu safely.

350
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:06,560
I'm afraid they won't easily let him off.

351
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,280
This trip to South Desolation

352
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:09,800
is destined to be arduous.

353
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,160
However,

354
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:15,110
with Qin in charge of the mission,

355
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:16,760
there is no task that cannot be completed.

356
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:18,000
Besides,

357
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:19,760
General Hua asked me

358
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,830
to bring you a letter.

359
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:22,800
And he said that the letter

360
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,280
may be the key to saving the day

361
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,590
in this trip.

362
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:26,880
What's more,

363
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:27,880
Qin,

364
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:29,430
before departure,

365
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,040
I will replace the staff with Tianchu soldiers.

366
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:33,590
I have to

367
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:34,520
be loyal to His Majesty

368
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,400
and act impartially.

369
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,710
I hope you can

370
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,040
put yourself in my shoes.

371
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:39,560
No problem.

372
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,760
I trust you.

373
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:43,920
Okay,

374
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:44,830
without further ado,

375
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:45,830
let's start our trip right now.

376
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:46,560
Okay.

377
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,310
It's been ten years.

378
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,520
Ten years.

379
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,040
We finally returned.

380
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:06,760
And this time

381
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,760
you come back with Little White Dove.

382
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,160
It's a happy ending.

383
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,000
My Lord,

384
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,350
that pal is sensitive.

385
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:35,040
I'm

386
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:35,920
Wang Song,

387
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:36,680
the guarder of Tianlu City,

388
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:39,470
also the leader of the mission.

389
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,430
Well,

390
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,160
You must be Lieutenant General Zou Yitian.

391
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,800
Nice to meet you, Your Excellency.

392
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,110
Welcome home, Your Highness.

393
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:50,640
Please have a rest in Prince Mu's Residence.

394
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:52,710
What do you mean?

395
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,590
You've promised to make an exchange.

396
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,760
Wanna break your word?

397
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,040
Miss Hua,

398
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,680
as a responsible state,

399
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,830
we will keep our promise.

400
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:04,760
Fine.

401
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,880
Since we are in your place,

402
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:09,040
we can't keep Duanmu Bai.

403
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,230
Fine.

404
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:12,830
I believe

405
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:13,950
you have a holistic vision.

406
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:15,350
and will not

407
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,000
back and fill.

408
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:19,950
If Miss Hua is still worried,

409
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:21,680
why don't you come with me?

410
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:22,680
Just in time

411
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,800
to get acquainted with your new home.

412
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:27,070
Before the wedding,

413
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,710
Her Highness has only one home,

414
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:30,350
and that is Tianchu.

415
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:32,470
Please suit yourself.

416
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,230
As a major matter between the two countries,

417
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:36,830
its process must be done according to rules.

418
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:38,000
Your Highness,

419
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,560
suit yourself, please.

420
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:41,400
Take it easy, Qin.

421
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:42,800
Sooner or later,

422
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,400
my residence will be Miss Hua's home.

423
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:48,880
This way, Your Highness.

424
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,160
Duanmu Bai is so arrogant.

425
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,830
Why doesn't our Lord fight back?

426
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:58,880
Those whom God wishes to destroy,

427
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,640
he first makes mad.

428
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:02,760
Then I will bring you

429
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,190
into the city to settle down.

430
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:05,680
But

431
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,280
I have to remind you first,

432
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,800
the road to Liuyun Pavilion

433
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:11,640
is not easy to walk.

434
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,880
What does he think he is? Just a mere underling.

435
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,560
He's a lieutenant general of Duanmu Qincang.

436
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,190
He's not only a brave fighter,

437
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,950
but also a good strategist.

438
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:28,040
One of

439
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,950
our great enemies.

440
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:43,400
Your Royal Highness

441
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,800
The heir has come back,

442
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,430
and the Tianchu mission has entered the city.

443
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,800
Well, welcome.

444
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:50,800
Are you ready for

445
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,950
the gift to our guests?

446
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,350
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

447
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,190
Piss off!

448
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,560
Piss off!

449
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,160
Piss off!

450
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:05,560
Piss off!

451
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,710
Go to hell!

452
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:08,070
Piss off!

453
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,230
Piss off!

454
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:10,950
Get out of here!

455
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,040
Piss off!

456
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,280
Rong,

457
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:18,640
these locals are too rude

458
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,830
to humiliate the Tianchu mission.

459
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:21,000
Why don't we stop them?

460
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,040
Leave them alone.

461
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:24,680
Keeping calm

462
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,880
can show our behavior as a power.

463
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:27,950
Piss off,

464
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:28,950
the mission!

465
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,160
Piss off!

466
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:33,920
Piss off!

467
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,950
Piss off

468
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:37,110
Piss off!

469
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,880
Get out of here!

470
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,640
Go to hell!

471
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:41,520
You shameless bastards!

472
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,520
Piss off!

473
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:45,280
Get out of here!

474
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,590
Shameless!

475
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:47,280
Mr. Zou,

476
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:49,800
is this the way you locals

477
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,400
treat your guests?

478
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:54,590
Since the war,

479
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:55,760
we nations are incompatible,

480
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:57,830
so people's grievances have been accumulating.

481
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,160
Never mind it.

482
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:03,160
What happened?

483
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,760
Don't worry, your Highness.

484
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,400
I won't

485
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,470
let anyone get close to the carriage.

486
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:10,070
Qin Shangcheng,

487
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,400
an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

488
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,350
It's about the dignity of Tianchu,

489
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,190
don't let it go.

490
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:15,640
Wait,

491
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,110
don't kill them.

492
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:18,110
Just teach them a lesson.

493
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:18,880
Be careful.

494
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,760
Okay, Your Highness.

495
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:26,400
Come on,

496
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:27,920
all of you.

497
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:30,310
You poor bastard!

498
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,280
How dare you come to our place

499
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:34,110
and insult us?

500
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,590
If you want to fight,

501
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,400
let's fight.

502
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:40,400
We, the Three Swordsmen in the capital,

503
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,190
will teach you a lesson.

504
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,190
You asked for it!

505
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:51,710
Go!

506
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,230
Anyone wanna challenge me?

507
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,000
Hurry up.

508
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,520
Outside the building, birds are singing,

509
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,350
and the beauty in the carriage is pouring the wine

510
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:05,520
Take it easy, man.

511
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,590
I just wanna see the beauty of the future princess.

512
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,350
Mr. Zou,

513
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,430
If I meet loose-lipped men

514
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:15,560
who don't watch their mouths next time,

515
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,950
they will lose

516
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,520
more than just teeth.

517
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,880
Well done, My Lord!

518
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,760
Since you regained your eyesight,

519
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,070
your skills have improved to a new level.

520
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,280
Qin, you're so masculine!

521
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:29,190
Princess,

522
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,280
I can do that, too.

523
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:35,160
Mr. Zou,

524
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,000
let's go.

525
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,000
Father.

526
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:36,800
Get up.

527
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:38,680
Yes.

528
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,470
Are you anxious over here?

529
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:50,760
I've been waiting for ten years.

530
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,920
I'm used to it.

531
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:55,350
I can see your grounds of complaint.

532
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,070
You were held hostage in Tianchu for ten years.

533
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,520
Feel wronged?

534
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,920
My son, you've grown up

535
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,000
and more mature.

536
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:08,800
Your Royal Highness,

537
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,110
Good news from the palace.

538
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:11,950
Stand down.

539
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:12,640
Yes.

540
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:15,800
Bai,

541
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,280
do you know

542
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,950
what this good news is about?

543
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:22,920
According to my guess,

544
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,310
the purpose of your secret return

545
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:27,190
must be grains.

546
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,590
I was told just now

547
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,640
that Qin Shangcheng defeated

548
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,400
some masters as soon as he entered the city.

549
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:34,880
This move

550
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:36,800
will inevitably lead to

551
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:38,230
public hostility towards Tianchu.

552
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,760
His Majesty

553
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,160
might have agreed to supply grains

554
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,710
under the pressure of the people.

555
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,430
If anything goes wrong

556
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:48,950
during the peace talk,

557
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,310
that will be our chance

558
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,520
to conquer Tianchu.

559
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,470
Son,

560
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,310
you're very smart.

561
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,000
You can understand what I thought.

562
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:02,470
Qin Shangcheng the King Pirate

563
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:03,950
is as difficult to deal with

564
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,230
as described in the legend.

565
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,920
Our purpose for taking the Rapier was revealed.

566
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,190
So about

567
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,880
the royal intermarriage...

568
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:15,710
You know...

569
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,590
I got it, father.

570
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,710
Stand down.

571
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:32,470
To make absolutely sure to get the Rapier,

572
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:35,710
I need a pawn.

573
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,280
Mr. Wang,

574
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:56,800
these are the guest rooms.

575
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:58,760
Necessities are ready.

576
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,310
You can have a rest first.

577
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:02,830
Tonight, the heir will hold a banquet

578
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:03,760
at the Yingbin Pavilion to welcome everyone.

579
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:04,680
Mr. Zou,

580
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:05,830
will the emperor's son-in-law

581
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:06,830
be at the banquet?

582
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,310
Don't hurry, Mr. Wang.

583
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:10,830
His Highness doesn't feel well these days,

584
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,920
and has been admitted to the palace for treatment,

585
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,280
so it's inconvenient for him to meet you.

586
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:15,880
Well,

587
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,110
please rest assured.

588
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,710
After the royal intermarriage,

589
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,110
the emperor's son-in-law

590
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:21,680
will be definitely sent back safe and sound.

591
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,640
A crappy excuse.

592
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,470
Sorry, uncle.

593
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:33,350
Forgot to introduce,

594
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,760
this is my new maid,

595
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,400
Ling.

596
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,830
She's used to being spoiled by me,

597
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:38,000
so she's somewhat outspoken.

598
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,640
It doesn't matter.

599
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,830
I know that you treat servants with courtesy.

600
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:46,230
I won't take it seriously.

601
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:47,710
However,

602
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,040
now I'm more suspicious of

603
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,590
the sincerity of South Desolation for royal intermarriage.

604
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,830
If they have ulterior motives,

605
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:55,520
it will make us in a disadvantage.

606
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,310
In the past few days,

607
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:59,190
Duanmu Bai has been asking for the Rapier.

608
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:00,710
The Rapier?

609
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:02,310
Yep, a treasure from the past.

610
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:03,830
It was a rusted short sword

611
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:05,070
that could not be pulled out.

612
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,190
I don't know what they want to do

613
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:10,400
with it.

614
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,710
But now the Rapier

615
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:14,040
is our only reliance.

616
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:15,590
In case of accidents,

617
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:17,160
I've hidden it

618
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,350
in a safe place.

619
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:19,920
That's good.

620
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,470
Uncle,

621
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:23,710
I suspect that emperor's son-in-law isn't in the palace.

622
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,560
I will enter the palace tonight

623
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,310
to present the gift of His Majesty.

624
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,800
I'll take this opportunity

625
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,560
to investigate his whereabouts.

626
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,230
Yes, please.

627
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:54,070
His Royal Highness is still in the front line

628
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:55,880
and he will return to the court someday.

629
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,520
The marriage is presided over by the heir.

630
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:01,160
First, on behalf of His Highness and the heir,

631
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:02,430
I will give you a toast.

632
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:19,280
By riverside are cooing,

633
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,880
a pair of turtledoves.

634
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,230
A good young man is wooing,

635
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:26,830
a fair maiden he loves.

636
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:29,310
The youth yearns day and night

637
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:31,710
for Little White Dove so fair.

638
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:34,190
His yearning grows so strong,

639
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:36,640
he cannot fall asleep.

640
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,800
The maiden he struggles to yearn,

641
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,400
just stand in front of him.

642
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,230
Thanks to the royal intermarriage,

643
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:46,800
the lovers finally meet.

644
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,830
I know you've been wondered

645
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,800
who rescued me.

646
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,070
Right,

647
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,190
Little White Dove.

648
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:13,710
Over the years,

649
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:16,110
I've received every letter

650
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,520
you wrote to your mother.

651
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:19,470
In the letter you said

652
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:21,040
that your favorite flower

653
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,640
is the balloon flower.

654
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,110
Its implication

655
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:26,680
is eternal love.

656
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,160
Here you are,

657
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:31,830
Little White Dove.

658
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,430
Thank you, your Highness.

659
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:38,350
But the implication of this flower

660
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:39,920
in Tianchu is completely different.

661
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:41,590
It means

662
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,800
hopeless love.

663
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,800
So you'd better

664
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,640
keep it for yourself.

665
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:49,830
It doesn't matter.

666
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:51,520
After getting married,

667
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:53,520
Miss Hua will be like a native.

668
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:54,920
What does it mean

669
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,590
depends on my wife.

670
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,230
Your Highness, don't you remember that

671
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:00,950
the ten-day wedding date

672
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,560
hasn't yet been set.

673
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,350
I'm afraid that you'll be disappointed.

674
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,470
Today, His Majesty's issued an imperial edict

675
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:07,800
that Miss Hua

676
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,070
and I

677
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,950
will get married tomorrow.

678
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,470
Wait a minute.

679
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,830
Why did His Majesty suddenly

680
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:21,040
set the marriage date

681
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,350
without discussing with me?

682
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,760
It's not only disrespectful to me,

683
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:26,470
but also disrespectful to Tianchu.

684
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:28,680
Please give me a reasonable answer.

685
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,280
This is the order of His Majesty,

686
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,310
and I have no right to intervene.

687
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:34,470
So in your eyes,

688
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,430
our marriage

689
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:37,000
is just a farce

690
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:37,950
for bigwigs and the people of the two countries.

691
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:40,400
I'm just a pawn in the peace talk,

692
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:40,830
right?

693
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:41,800
No, you misunderstand.

694
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,160
I love you from the bottom

695
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:44,950
of my heart.

696
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,110
Okay.

697
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:49,160
Only one demand.

698
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,310
Okay, please.

699
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:53,000
I want a trial marriage.

700
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,350
Okay.

701
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:01,350
Just one day.

702
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,110
Hurry up.

703
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:23,830
Dayou,

704
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:24,950
Qin,

705
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:25,950
Zhang,

706
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:26,680
long time no see.

707
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:29,880
Zhu is the spy I sent to South Desolation

708
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,880
to investigate the whereabouts of His Highness.

709
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,310
I met her

710
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,880
in the woods this afternoon.

711
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,640
Rong.

712
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:43,520
Sorry,

713
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,800
I should call you General Hua Jr.

714
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,190
Call me whatever you want.

715
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:47,000
Go down to business,

716
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,760
how's the investigation going?

717
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,310
Rong, rest assured,

718
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,680
everything is clear.

719
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:55,680
With the efforts of all the fairy spies,

720
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,830
we've got in touch with Xing.

721
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:59,350
The brothel where Xing works

722
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:00,400
is called Utopia,

723
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,040
an intelligence station

724
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,800
established by the boss of Shangguan Hong.

725
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:06,160
According to the information provided by Xing,

726
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,560
the emperor's son-in-law

727
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,840
was imprisoned in Prince Mu's Residence.

728
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,120
I got it!

729
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,560
No wonder Rong

730
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,670
proposed a trail marriage.

731
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,230
It turned out to be a trick!

732
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,190
Ummm, Qin...

733
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,000
Qin Shangcheng,

734
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,150
what do you think?

735
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:38,080
Good idea.

736
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,909
First, it buys time.

737
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:42,230
Second, we can use the trial marriage

738
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,469
to rescue His Highness.

739
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,909
Kill two birds with one stone.

740
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:47,190
We'll follow your plan tomorrow.

741
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:52,000
Qin Shangcheng!

742
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,150
Qin Shangcheng!

743
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,710
Sixth Princess.

744
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,430
Uh huh?

745
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:09,950
Can we talk?

746
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:11,630
Okay.

747
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,320
What a happy accident!

748
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,560
I also have some questions to ask you.

749
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:15,800
Talk in your room?

750
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:16,470
Okay,

751
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,360
welcome.

752
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:23,870
Qian,

753
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,910
are these two women

754
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:27,080
arguing for you?

755
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:30,710
Oh yeah? Undeniable charm.

756
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:32,190
In this world,

757
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:33,280
only My Lord can understand my troubles.

758
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:35,670
Well done, Qian.

759
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,470
The head of Fairy Spy

760
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,040
and Sixth Princess.

761
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,840
You know what?

762
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,080
It never rains

763
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:45,870
but it pours.

764
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:46,840
But I tell you,

765
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:49,190
I, Qian Dayou, am loyal to the princess.

766
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,430
I'll never change my mind.

767
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,910
I should make it clear to them.

768
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,630
Are they fighting?

769
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:03,230
Gosh!

770
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:04,670
Calm down!

771
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:05,320
Calm...

772
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,560
Qian,

773
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,600
you come just in time.

774
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,520
We had a good time drinking

775
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,080
and accidentally knocked over the jug.

776
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,120
Get us a new one.

777
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,470
Thank you, Dayou.

778
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,120
Trust me, princess.

779
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,120
Tomorrow I will apply to Rong

780
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,840
to let you join the Fairy Spy.

781
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,390
From now on we are like sisters.

782
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:23,000
Share weal and woe.

783
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,120
Great!

784
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:24,840
Since then

785
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,560
I will also be a heroine

786
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,280
with a Jianghu identity.
[*The environment where the martial artists live.]

787
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:28,280
Come on, Zhu.

788
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,280
Let's drink.

789
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,320
Hurry up!

790
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,280
Come on.

791
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,230
Thank God, Zhang is not here.

792
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:48,280
It's so embarrassing.

793
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:51,910
Wanna wine?

794
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:52,840
Let it go.

795
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:54,000
Binge-drinking is not good

796
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,000
and troublesome.

797
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:06,430
My lord,

798
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:09,150
you love her so much!

799
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,430
But I can't understand.

800
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:13,560
Just now at the banquet,

801
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,630
why did Miss Hua

802
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:17,150
propose a trial marriage?

803
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:17,910
Does she

804
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:20,280
not want to marry you?

805
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,040
Quite the opposite.

806
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,280
You know,

807
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:26,560
tough love.

808
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:31,800
You mean...

809
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,760
Miss Hua did it on purpose?

810
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:36,910
Yep.

811
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,600
I know Little White Dove.

812
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,470
She won't merely obey her parents' orders

813
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,280
to accept an arranged marriage.

814
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:46,190
She seeks freedom of love.

815
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:49,120
Because she treat it carefully

816
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,150
and wanted lasting love,

817
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,710
she proposed the trial marriage.

818
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:55,950
You're right.

819
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:57,760
Besides,

820
00:37:58,710 --> 00:37:59,560
This trial marriage

821
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,230
can be an unique pre-wedding ceremony.

822
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:03,800
Why not?

823
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:08,000
Whoa,

824
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,560
you know her so much.

825
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,150
But I found that Qin Shangcheng

826
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,520
was still coveting Miss Hua.

827
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:14,470
My lord,

828
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:16,000
you have to be careful.

829
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:22,870
No one can stop us from getting married.

830
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,360
Little White Dove

831
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,320
will definitely be my wife.

832
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,470
So you mean,

833
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,120
when Hua Rong mentioned the trial marriage,

834
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:35,910
he agreed at once?

835
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,320
Yes, sir.

836
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:39,800
Should I invite the heir over here?

837
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:40,630
No need.

838
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:43,230
These Tianchu people just delay

839
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:45,470
to find their emperor's son-in-law.

840
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:47,320
Why not turn to advantage their plot?

841
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:50,080
Invite my guest here.

842
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:50,630
Yes, sir.

843
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,080
Take him here.

844
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,760
You are the one who sold the distribution map

845
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:02,520
of Tianchu granaries and betrayed His Highness,

846
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:03,870
aren't you?

847
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:06,080
You are the one who asked Shangguan Hong

848
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,630
to kill Hua Rong at Qing Hong Villa,

849
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,470
aren't you?

850
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,000
You've set up an intelligence station,

851
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:16,320
trading in intelligence and conducting corruption.

852
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,870
You're the boss of Utopia,

853
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,190
right?

854
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,360
Who are you?

855
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,000
There are two paths before you.

856
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:27,950
The first one,

857
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:29,230
stay here

858
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:30,630
and cooperate with me.

859
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:31,840
After it's done,

860
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:33,800
you can have whatever you want.

861
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:34,950
The second one,

862
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:37,390
I tell you who I am

863
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,000
and kill you.

864
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,430
Which one

865
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:53,840
do you want to choose?

866
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:19,520
Where is Qian?

867
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,430
My Lord!

868
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:28,190
My Lord!

869
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,230
Stay where you are.

870
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:32,150
My Lord!

871
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,390
I have some pastry.

872
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:34,470
Do you want to send it to Her Highness?

873
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,910
I've sent her some.

874
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:36,760
Well,

875
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:38,000
what's wrong?

876
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:41,630
My Lord!

877
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,150
Did you see Qian?

878
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:44,600
That pal,

879
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,910
I've searched for him for an hour.

880
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:48,000
He lost the chess game

881
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,670
and sloped off without paying me.

882
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,390
I've said it long ago,

883
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:54,760
no gambling between brothers.

884
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:56,600
Gambling hurts relationships.

885
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,560
Listen, don't

886
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,670
bring this up again.

887
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,560
Get it?

888
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,760
It was him that wanted to gamble.

889
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,840
Yes, My Lord.

890
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,230
Qin Shangcheng.

891
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:47,800
Rong.

892
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:49,120
It's late.

893
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:50,190
Why don't you go to bed?

894
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:53,150
Piss off！

895
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:54,280
How dare you!

896
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,150
Come on, Zhang!

897
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:56,040
How dare you!

898
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:56,520
Your Highness!

899
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,080
Be self-aware.

900
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,040
Yeah!

901
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,230
Clumsy imitation.

902
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,520
Ridiculous!

903
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,150
This is it!
