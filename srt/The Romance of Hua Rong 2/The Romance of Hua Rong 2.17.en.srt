[The Romance of Hua Rong 2]
[EP17]

3
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,680
Your roast chicken is the best.

4
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,120
Why are you staring at me?

5
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,120
Do you want some?

6
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,190
Nothing.

7
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,590
I'm just thinking,

8
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,400
it's been a long time

9
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,480
since I've been with you alone.

10
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,160
As long as you're by my side,

11
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:12,030
even if I am trapped here all my life,

12
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,110
I don't mind at all.

13
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,390
No way.

14
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,390
I‘ve promised you to find out your identity.

15
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,800
Besides,

16
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,750
we still don't know who the mysterious person

17
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,320
behind Duanmu Bai is.

18
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:22,440
Who the hell knows what conspiracy they're up to.

19
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,079
Don't worry,

20
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,720
I'll let him pay

21
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,270
his debt of blood,

22
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,670
sooner or later.

23
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,800
The assassination at Mermaid Bay

24
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,670
or hypnotizing you to assassinate me,

25
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,440
their goal is the Rapier.

26
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,270
What do you think they want the Rapier for?

27
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,030
Now that I look back,

28
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,030
Duanmu Bai had been telling me before that

29
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,720
Duanmu Qingcang and hundreds of people
of Prince Mu's Residence

30
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,110
were waiting for his rescue.

31
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,000
But what does getting the Rapier have to do

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,880
with the rescue?

33
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,600
If Duanmu Bai wants the Rapier and to become
leader of martial arts community,

34
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,190
it must be related to the Imperial Alliance.

35
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,520
Anyway, no matter what his purpose is,

36
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,670
I will definitely not let him do it.

37
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,320
Then we shouldn't delay.

38
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,600
Let's find a way to leave the Orchid Valley

39
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,630
and qualify the second round of assessment.

40
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,240
OK.

41
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,670
Why follow me?

42
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,000
There is only one road to the Orchid Valley,

43
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,600
so it is not surprising to meet by chance.

44
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:40,550
Fine,

45
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:42,240
I'll take another road.

46
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:43,720
We shouldn't meet again.

47
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:46,910

[I can't bear it anymore.]

52
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,320
[I don't need to bear it anymore.]

53
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,670
Duanmu Bai,

54
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:01,600
Listen up,

55
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,270
I don't want to disguise anymore.

56
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:04,390
I just follow you, like it or not.

57
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,160
Then follow along if you want.

58
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:10,600
Don't try to get rid of me.

59
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:18,070
There are more and more orchids along the way,

60
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,550
and bordering the bamboo forest.

61
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,320
From this perspective,

62
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,880
is this bamboo forest the core area of

63
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,000
the Orchid Valley?

64
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,390
You got it right.

65
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,200
The Orchid Valley is full of dangers

66
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:32,200
and risks.

67
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:34,480
We both need to be vigilant.

68
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:41,550
Let's go.

69
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:41,950
Ok.

70
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,270
Qin Shangcheng,

71
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,110
we've come to where we were, haven't we?

72
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,110
Yes, we are still trapped

73
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,830
in this wood after walking for half a day.

74
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:29,320
Are we lost in a maze?

75
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,390
Maze...Huh

76
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,480
I recalled a similar maze

77
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,760
called Changlin Formation

78
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,350
in an ancient book.

79
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,920
This formation is ever-changing,

80
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,350
It is impossible to break it without
finding its center.

81
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,000
"The center of wood formation

82
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,790
is surrounded by water."

83
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,270
Surrounded by water...

84
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,350
Then we need to find water.

85
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,040
But I didn't see any water

86
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,720
along the way.

87
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,270
It's getting dark.

88
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,880
Why don't we find a place to rest

89
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,040
and look for water tomorrow?

90
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,000
No need to wait until tomorrow.

91
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:02,920
I have an idea.

92
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,350
You are really smart.

93
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,720
This bamboo is sharpened and will be inserted

94
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,270
into the soil to test the moisture

95
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,070
so to find water, right?

96
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:15,640
This is the method my father

97
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,720
who often used it in marching.

98
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,790
I stole it from him.

99
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:18,920
Let's look for it together.

100
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:19,920
OK.

101
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:44,390
Smells good?

102
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,550
My roasted sweet potato is the best.

103
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,600
Want to try?

104
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,640
- What are you doing?
- Hush!

105
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,480
What can mere poisonous insects do to me?

106
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,600
They are poisonous insects of the Imperial
Island.

107
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:18,720
They don't care who you are,

108
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,830
and will gather more and more here.

109
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:22,600
Do you have any idea then?

110
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:24,720
Run.

111
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,070
Run.

112
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,640
This is your plan?

113
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,640
There's a better one.

114
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:42,159
What?

115
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,040
Climb the tree.

116
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:44,880
Are you kidding me?

117
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,950
There're so many insects on the tree.

118
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,000
Then don't ask so many questions, okay?

119
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,110
Stay still.

120
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,200
What?

121
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,760
There's a poisonous spider on your shoulder.

122
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,830
What should I do?

123
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:00,670
Don't move.

124
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:16,040
Don't move.

125
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,000
A spider on your shoulder.

126
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,110
They are all over the tree.

127
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:45,840
I must have owed you a lot in my last life.

128
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,710
The soil is getting wetter.

129
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,320
We are not far from the water.

130
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,760
The water-seeking method you learned

131
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,910
from my father-in-law

132
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:04,350
works fine.

133
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,320
The formation center is not far away.

134
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:07,670
Let's go.

135
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:25,280
It should be here.

136
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,760
As long as we remove this flower

137
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,200
and clear the spring hole,

138
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,640
letting the spring water flow,

139
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,670
the Changlin Formation can be broken.

140
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,910
I'll do it.

141
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,670
The water is coming out.

142
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,200
The Formation has been
broken.

143
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:48,320
Fragrant.

144
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:48,760
No,

145
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,790
There are many strange poisons in the Orchid
Valley.

146
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:51,350
Lose it.

147
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,550
Let's go.

148
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:09,710
Here's a wooden house.

149
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:12,080
Let's go in and have a look.

150
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,840
I've left marks

151
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,470
for Qian Dayou and Zhang Xian along the way.

152
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:16,880
When they arrive,

153
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,840
we will go together.

154
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,320
So many books.

155
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,470
Why are herbs everywhere in this room?

156
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,350
The owner of this house should be

157
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,000
very knowledgeable about medicine and poison.

158
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:10,350
What's this?

159
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,880
Blood exchange.

160
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,350
Taking orchid decoction as the guiding drug,

161
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,550
with the help of giant silkworm,

162
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:19,670
the blood of a strong person can be

163
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,110
injected into the body of a poisoned person

164
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,590
to delay the spread of the toxin,

165
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,760
so to buy time for antidote development.

166
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,200
It's the first time I've heard of blood exchange.

167
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,440
Perhaps this method

168
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,880
can save lives at a critical moment.

169
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,470
Mu Qing.

170
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:36,110
Presumably Mu Qing is a well-known figure

171
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:37,440
in Imperial Alliance.

172
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,400
Therefore, outside the wooden house,

173
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:40,670
he must have placed herbs

174
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,440
that can prevent poisonous insects,

175
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,440
so as to ensure the tranquility of this place.

176
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:46,790
Rong.

177
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:48,000
Rong.

178
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It's the sign of poisoning.

179
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:55,350
Could it be that flower?

180
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,320
You're finally awake.

181
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:30,590
Did you apply the herbs for me?

182
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,280
I didn't just apply the herbs,

183
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,760
I suck the poison for you.

184
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:39,440
What else did you do to me?

185
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,400
What do you want me to do to you?

186
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,710
Or

187
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,400
what do you expect me to do to you?

188
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:47,470
No.

189
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,790
Relax.

190
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,670
You have nothing to lose to be my man.

191
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,320
Thank you for detoxing me.

192
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You don't have to be responsible for me.

193
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,880
I'm not interested in you.

194
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,230
Since you're not interested in me,

195
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,590
why do you take my butterfly hairpin

196
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:07,350
with you?

197
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:10,030
You obviously like me,

198
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,350
but still pretend not to be.

199
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:12,470
Boring.

200
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,910
I know you are on a family mission

201
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:18,520
and don't want to waste time on personal affection.

202
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,790
After the Imperial Alliance Conference is over,

203
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:21,960
you can go to complete your mission

204
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,280
and give me your answer after that.

205
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:50,670
My Lord.

206
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,440
My Lord.

207
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,150
The decoction is ready.

208
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:54,230
Yeah.

209
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,400
The giant silkworm is ready, too.

210
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:00,550
You two can go.

211
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:01,550
OK.

212
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:01,960
My Lord,

213
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,000
we are guarding outside,

214
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,790
you can call us at any time.

215
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:38,790
What time is it?

216
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:40,230
Go.

217
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,080
You're awake.

218
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:11,640
Do you feel better?

219
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:13,790
What happened to me?

220
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,200
You are poisoned.

221
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,520
Was it the flower we saw when

222
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,400
we breaking the Changlin Formation yesterday?

223
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:32,590
Yeah.

224
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,280
According to Xian and Dayou's investigation,

225
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,080
the center of the Changlin Formation

226
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:39,400
has been manipulated.

227
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:41,400
It must have been premeditated.

228
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,350
Is it the mysterious man behind Duanmu Bai again?

229
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:46,910
It should be.

230
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,520
He's a master of poison.

231
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,790
Besides,

232
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,640
he was able to move freely in the Changlin
Formation.

233
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,760
He must know the Imperial Island well.

234
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,230
There is only one person who can do both.

235
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:01,350
Kong Lin.

236
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,310
In this case,

237
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,520
you were previously hypnotized

238
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,760
by the same person.

239
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:18,400
Qin Shangcheng,

240
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,349
you didn't save me with blood-exchange,

241
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:21,349
did you?

242
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:24,680
Rong,

243
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,640
from now on,

244
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:28,560
you have my blood in your body,

245
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,640
and we will never be apart again.

246
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,520
Qing Shangcheng.

247
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,110
What the hell is this?

248
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,560
her highness is back through twists and turns,

249
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:51,920
how come this happened to her?

250
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,400
Xian,

251
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,800
if you have time to talk,

252
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,000
you might as well keep looking for.

253
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,760
Dayou, look.

254
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:06,950
Is it the one?

255
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:12,520
My Lord.

256
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,400
They correspond.

257
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,560
Love-breaking Hibiscus.

258
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,310
Imperial Alliance poison.

259
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,590
Blood lines appear from the back of the poisoned
person,

260
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,160
and they converge on the palm

261
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,400
to form a pattern of a hibiscus flower.

262
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,160
The deeper the poisoning,

263
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,800
the darker the color of the hibiscus flower.

264
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,830
Within two days,

265
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,680
the poisoned person will die.

266
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,230
Tell me the way

267
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,190
to detox.

268
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:40,000
Emmm,

269
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,920
as the name suggests, this Love-breaking Hibiscus

270
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,310
must be caused by emotional entanglements.

271
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,830
If you want to completely detoxify,

272
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,520
you must break your entanglement.

273
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,110
I know what to do.

274
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,880
Rong, why did you come out?

275
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,560
I've got some goodies for you.

276
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,160
There are red bean cakes,

277
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:16,350
soybean cakes.

278
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:17,830
Try one.

279
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,040
Qing Shangcheng,

280
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,430
tell me the truth.

281
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:24,110
Are you planning to leave me

282
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,760
after we leave the Orchid Valley?

283
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:27,680
Why did you say that?

284
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:29,880
I heard it all.

285
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:33,040
Don't think you can push me away like before.

286
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,070
I'm telling you,

287
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,280
there's no way

288
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,070
you can leave me.

289
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,520
How could I leave you?

290
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:44,230
Since this poison comes from the Imperial Alliance
Flower,

291
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:46,310
there must be an antidote within the Imperial
Alliance.

292
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,280
I will do my best to be the leader of the Imperial
Alliance,

293
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:50,470
and gather the power of the Imperial Alliance

294
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,560
to detoxify this poison in you.

295
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,400
You really didn't lie to me?

296
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,400
Of course I didn't.

297
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,520
I promised you that

298
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,350
I would stand by your side,

299
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,000
face everything together.

300
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,000
I'll never break my promise.

301
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,470
Let's eat cakes, shall we?

302
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:06,920
OK.

303
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,310
Have some, too.

304
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:27,000
Congratulations to Duanmu and Chi Hong

305
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,560
for being the first to qualify the examination to
compete for the leader of the alliance.

306
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,000
I quit.

307
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,920
I'm not interested in anything

308
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,760
but you right now.

309
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,430
Do not forget our agreement.

310
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:48,950
Mr. Kong,

311
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,520
Crab.

312
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:51,470
Congratulations to both of you.

313
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:52,590
What is there to congratulate?

314
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,110
Although Rong broke the trap,

315
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,040
she was poisoned by a traitor

316
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,350
and was no longer able to participate in the
follow-up competition.

317
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:00,830
But I, Qin Shangcheng,

318
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:03,760
will find those responsible.

319
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,230
OK.

320
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:08,680
That being the case,

321
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:13,310
tomorrow will see the martial arts contest

322
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:15,000
between Duanmu and Qin in front of the Imperial
Palace

323
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,880
for the alliance leader final.

324
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:20,230
It's getting late,

325
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,590
please go back to the Imperial Palace

326
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,110
to rest.

327
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:28,950
Rong.

328
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:29,640
Crab,

329
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:30,950
are you okay?

330
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,430
Sister,

331
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,590
the most important thing is that

332
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,760
I recall everything

333
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,400
between you and me.

334
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,040
Really?

335
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:41,160
Great!

336
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:42,760
my estimate is pretty accurate,

337
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,830
I have my worries put away then.

338
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:52,190
Who gave you the permission to poison Hua Rong
behind my back?

339
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:55,230
I used this poison

340
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,430
originally for the sake of you.

341
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,350
At Star Lake,

342
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,040
Hua Rong has broken my hypnotism,

343
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:03,680
so I took advantage of the situation

344
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,710
and poisoned her

345
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,800
at the Changlin Formation

346
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:08,350
with Love-breaking Hibiscus.

347
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,710
You are so scheming.

348
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:15,710
His Royal Highness is in prison now,

349
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,950
Everything I do

350
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:19,190
is to fulfill the task that

351
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:20,590
His Royal Highness gave me,

352
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,070
and to help you

353
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:23,920
get the last emperor's testamentary edict.

354
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,760
What is the connection between the testamentary
edict and Love-breaking Hibiscus?

355
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:31,430
This poison is the unique secret poison of the
Imperial Alliance.

356
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:34,590
The only antidote is hidden in the secret chamber.

357
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,350
Your Highness,

358
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,070
Now you should know what to do, right?

359
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:44,920
Don't do anything behind my back,

360
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,110
or I will not spare you.

361
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,640
Your Highness

362
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,430
should know that

363
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,400
you carry the lives of hundreds of people

364
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,310
in Prince Mu's Residence on your shoulders.

365
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,590
I will take the testamentary edict of course.

366
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,560
Just do what you have to do.

367
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:22,830
Rong's time is running out.

368
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,310
I must try every way

369
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,590
and do my best

370
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:27,350
to detoxify this poison.

371
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,070
What are you doing here?

372
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:36,800
Don't be afraid.

373
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,000
I just came to tell you one thing.

374
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,520
If you came for the Rapier,

375
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:44,190
then you don't have to waste your words.

376
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,470
If you want the Rapier,

377
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,710
come and get it in the arena tomorrow.

378
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,310
The antidote to Love-breaking Hibiscus

379
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:50,560
is only available in the secret chamber of the
Imperial Alliance.

380
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:52,830
To open the secret chamber,

381
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:54,560
you must use the Rapier.

382
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:55,950
However,

383
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,230
to pull out the sword,

384
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,680
you need the blood of the Imperial Son.

385
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:01,800
So,

386
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:04,280
only I can save Hua Rong.

387
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:07,680
You can think about it,

388
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:09,230
and if you want to fight,

389
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,560
I'll fight to the end.

390
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,680
Sooner or later we'll have to settle our grudge.

391
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,430
But

392
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,350
I don't want anything to happen to Hua Rong.

393
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:23,560
Duanmu Bai,

394
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,350
I don't give a damn

395
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:29,430
about the position of the alliance leader.

396
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:31,520
The only thing I care about is Rong.

397
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:33,710
If you can really open the secret chamber

398
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:35,190
and find the antidote to save Rong,

399
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,350
what's the harm in giving you the Rapier?

400
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:39,680
But if you can't save her,

401
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:42,350
I will not spare you.

402
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:49,430
The Rapier returns to the alliance,

403
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,040
the day of revival is just around the corner.

404
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:55,350
My Lord.

405
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:57,830
My Lord.

406
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,400
The revival of the Imperial Alliance

407
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,830
is just around the corner.

408
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,160
In testimony of the Rapier,

409
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,880
May God bless the Imperial Alliance.

410
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,830
I, Duanmu Bai, as the new alliance leader,

411
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,800
will lead the Imperial Alliance

412
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,230
back to glory.

413
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:14,760
Envoy Kong,

414
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:16,710
start the altar ceremony immediately.

415
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:18,920
The moment when the Rapier is pulled out,

416
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,000
is when we Imperial Alliance

417
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:23,470
announces its return to Jianghu.

418
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,680
Yes, My Lord.

419
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,560
After twenty years of silence,

420
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,070
the Imperial Alliance

421
00:25:59,070 --> 00:25:59,920
has now resurfaced.

422
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,400
Worthy of being the first sect back then.

423
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:03,830
Let me tell you,

424
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,110
this is why the Rapier

425
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,430
is sought after by so many people.

426
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,160
But this time our Lord gave up the competition

427
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,350
for her highness.

428
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:09,680
Right

429
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:11,520
He is indeed a role model as a husband.

430
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,400
In terms of flattery,

431
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,680
you and Meng have a match.

432
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,430
Just so so.

433
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:23,760
Your Highness.

434
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:04,800
What happened?

435
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,470
He can't pull it out.

436
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:06,110
Indeed.

437
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,040
Why can't he pull it out?

438
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:07,800
He could be a liar, couldn't he?

439
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:09,280
Is he fake?

440
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,680
What's going on?

441
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,160
Where did the liar come from?

442
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:16,040
If he could pull it out, he would have done it already.

443
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,110
Is he the Imperial Son or not?

444
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:20,280
Is he fake?

445
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,560
Is he a liar?

446
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,950
Where did the liar come from?

447
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,560
Give us an explanation.

448
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,190
Yeah.

449
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:26,560
Give us an explanation.

450
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,190
Give us an explanation.

451
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:28,280
If you can't pull it out, just come down.

452
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,520
The rule of the Imperial Alliance provides that

453
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:30,830
whoever pulls out the Rapier

454
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:32,160
should be the leader of the alliance.

455
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,350
I should try.

456
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,070
Yes.

457
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:35,950
I can try.

458
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:37,190
I want to try, too.

459
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,230
Didn't you say you were the son of the Imperial
Lady and

460
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:44,760
could open the secret chamber to save Rong?

461
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,920
Why can't you even pull out the Rapier now?

462
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:48,880
You tell me!

463
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:49,710
Speak up!

464
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,520
Qin Shangcheng!

465
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,430
Calm down.

466
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,190
I also want to save Crab,

467
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,520
but does it look like he's doing this

468
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,590
on purpose?

469
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:57,920
I'm fine.

470
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,760
He has waited for this day to take the Rapier.

471
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:01,880
He has no reason not to pull out the Rapier if he could.

472
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,520
I said,

473
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:05,760
if he couldn't save Rong,

474
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:08,110
I would leave no mercy on him.

475
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:09,310
He's my man.

476
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,590
Don't you dare touch him!

477
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,430
If you want to fight,

478
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:14,560
go away.

479
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:16,070
Don't stand in the way.

480
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:16,800
That's right.

481
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,880
The one who can pull out the Rapier

482
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,920
is the alliance leader.

483
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,400
There are many of us.

484
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,040
Let's beat him together.

485
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:20,920
What could he do to us alone?

486
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,520
That's enough!

487
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,430
I'm telling you,

488
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,880
it's none of your business

489
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,590
at all.

490
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,470
Whoever gets involved

491
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:32,520
will end up dead.

492
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,590
Qin Shangcheng,

493
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,920
listen to me.

494
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,560
Qin Shangcheng,

495
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:50,830
I know you did it

496
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:51,950
all for me.

497
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:54,470
But you know me.

498
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,190
I

499
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:58,040
don't want to drag others

500
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:59,560
into my own business

501
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,520
and cause unnecessary sacrifices.

502
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:12,040
As for you,

503
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,950
you should all know that

504
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,280
the Rapier can only be pulled out

505
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,280
with the blood of the Imperial Son.

506
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,160
For so many years,

507
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:21,070
how many of you in the Imperial Alliance

508
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,920
have wished to pull out the Rapier

509
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:25,560
and take over the position of the alliance leader,

510
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:29,230
killing each other disregarding the lives of your
fellow disciples.

511
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,640
Now, you still do.

512
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,520
Aren't you ashamed to stay in the Imperial
Alliance?

513
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,230
Qin Shangcheng,

514
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:45,040
If this Rapier can only

515
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:48,280
bring the Imperial Alliance blood,

516
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:50,400
then I will destroy it.

517
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:52,160
Can I?

518
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,190
Rong.

519
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:11,430
Crab.

520
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,470
Your Highness.

521
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:19,310
The door is open.

522
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,160
The door is open.

523
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:20,800
Yeah.

524
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,000
I didn't expect it to be her.

525
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,920
Never expect this.

526
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:26,350
How come it's you?

527
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,280
Why you?

528
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,470
My Lady.

529
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,310
My Lady.

530
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,280
Envoy Kong,

531
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:54,280
now the alliance leader has showed herself,

532
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,760
but she has been poisoned

533
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:57,680
and the antidote is in the secret chamber.

534
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,590
Please lead the way.

535
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:00,950
OK.

536
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:05,470
Worthy of being the first sect back then.

537
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,560
This secret room is intricate,

538
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,830
and it is really sophisticated.

539
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:10,640
I have been fortunate enough

540
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,430
to come here several times with the former leader.

541
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:15,430
There are many triggers.

542
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:16,760
Everybody,

543
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:19,640
don't touch anything here.

544
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:20,920
Where is the antidote?

545
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,310
All antidotes of the Imperial Alliance poison

546
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:26,070
are stored in the Pharmacy.

547
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:27,950
Follow me.

548
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:40,350
Let's go.

549
00:32:58,470 --> 00:32:59,070
Everyone,

550
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,520
This is the Pharmacy.

551
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:02,800
Please.

552
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:13,280
My Lord,

553
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,520
are we coming in?

554
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:15,760
Yeah.

555
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:17,190
Duanmu Bai has gone in.

556
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,190
Let's go.

557
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,070
My Lord,

558
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:50,710
What should we do?

559
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:51,710
Find the antidote first.

560
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:52,430
OK.

561
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:55,470
Rong,

562
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,310
sit down.

563
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:57,800
Here.

564
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:05,400
Wait for me.

565
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,190
I'll be back soon.

566
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,909
Get Crab the antidote first.

567
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:01,600
Where is it?

568
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:05,870
My Lord,

569
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:06,710
We've searched everywhere,

570
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:07,910
but we can't find the antidote.

571
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:08,910
My Lord,

572
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,280
Kong Lin locked us here

573
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,150
and wouldn't let us out,

574
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,670
maybe the antidote isn't here.

575
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:20,000
Duanmu Bai,

576
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:21,560
where is the antidote?

577
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,150
What do you mean?

578
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,080
The mysterious person behind you is Kong Lin,

579
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,320
who is your teacher, right?

580
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:29,360
You want the Rapier in every possible way

581
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,870
just to open the secret chamber.

582
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,120
I guess,

583
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:33,840
you must be wanting something

584
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,630
in the secret chamber, right?

585
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:41,360
So what?

586
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:44,320
Qin Shangcheng.

587
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,800
I don't care what you want,

588
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:47,950
either

589
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:49,800
you give me the antidote now

590
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:50,520
or

591
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:52,470
die.

592
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,670
Put down the knife first,

593
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:54,600
let me talk to him.

594
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:55,870
Duanmu Bai,

595
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,950
the priority now is to get out quickly.

596
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:00,040
Open the door if you know the trigger.

597
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,430
Crab is dying.

598
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,600
Kong Lin is indeed my teacher,

599
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,520
but I really don't know how to open this door.

600
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,430
Qin Shangcheng,

601
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:14,520
Rong,

602
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,080
he shouldn't have lied.

603
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,520
Your Highness,

604
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,280
At this moment,

605
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,520
you still speak for this guy.

606
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,560
This stone door is heavy and thick,

607
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,470
we can't break it.

608
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,390
We could die in here.

609
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,320
For all triggers in this world,

610
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:27,870
as long as there is a way to close them,

611
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,120
there is a way to open them.

612
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,150
Qin Shangcheng,

613
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:40,040
that's a secret door, too.

614
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,630
Now,

615
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:04,190
the healthy Rong is finally back.

616
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:05,190
Qin Shangcheng,

617
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,600
I didn't break my word this time.

618
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,430
Indeed you didn't.

619
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,470
You turned into a mermaid

620
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:13,390
and stabbed me in the chest.

621
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:16,760
I can compensate you.

622
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,710
I'll think about it

623
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:23,520
How about

624
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:24,760
a kiss?

625
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,470
Now call it even, right?

626
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:29,230
Not enough.

627
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:34,280
Enough now?

628
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,560
How is this enough?

629
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,600
Not enough at all.

630
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,360
Qin Shangcheng,

631
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:38,560
don't get too far.

632
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:39,870
No,

633
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:41,360
you really want to murder your husband?

634
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:46,080
Sorry,

635
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,150
I haven't gotten used to it yet.

636
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:49,800
This is my professional habit.

637
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:50,800
It will be fine.

638
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,600
Get used to.

639
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:52,560
Let's go.

640
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:54,150
Go.
