3
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:53,630
Careful!

4
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:54,229
It hurts.

5
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:57,759
Hold on!

6
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:00,630
Give me a hand.

7
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,600
My Lord,

8
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,440
It's truly a bloody war.

9
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,440
Hold on!

10
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,720
General Hua Jr.

11
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,270
Swordsman Qin.

12
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,440
We were raided by South Desolation this morning,

13
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,520
so please forgive me for

14
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,079
not being able to greet you in person.

15
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:30,270
It doesn't matter, Vice-City Keeper.

16
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,670
Just rest and heal your wounds.

17
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:33,270
From now on,

18
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,360
we are here to take over all.

19
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,550
Thank you, please help.

20
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:38,960
Where's my father?

21
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,110
Don't worry.

22
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,320
The General is in barracks

23
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:42,360
and he is safe.

24
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,750
Rong, Cheng,

25
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:49,829
you could come to help me.

26
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:50,750
I

27
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,320
feel so gratified.

28
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,270
Dad,

29
00:02:53,829 --> 00:02:54,960
don't worry too much.

30
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,190
We'll figure it out together.

31
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,750
Here's what's going on.

32
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,520
Duanmu Qingcang

33
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:04,000
killed our emissary

34
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:05,670
and refused our peace talks.

35
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:07,320
And also,

36
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,240
South Desolation recently raided us several times.

37
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:13,320
Lieutenant Yan led the advance troops to resist
their attack.

38
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,440
Our side suffered heavy casualties

39
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,910
and the morale is very low.

40
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:19,270
If this decline is not reversed,

41
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,240
Tianlu City

42
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,160
will be in danger.

43
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,079
Cheng,

44
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:28,670
the situation has been explained
in the letter from Rong.

45
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,470
The commander of the enemy

46
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,110
is your biological father.

47
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,470
Have you figured out how to deal with it?

48
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,110
No father and son on the battlefield.

49
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,880
When the enemy is strong,

50
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,390
I can talk on equal terms with them

51
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,240
only after winning two battles.

52
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,670
We are outnumbered

53
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,110
in this force,

54
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:52,270
so we need to avoid head-to-head combat.

55
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,910
I guess

56
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:57,000
the enemy will be ready to pursue us

57
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,240
with high morale.

58
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,080
They are likely building a bridge
to cross the river at this moment.

59
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,630
So we need to deploy more forces

60
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,550
on the riverbank

61
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,440
to slow their river crossing.

62
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:07,390
Exactly.

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,190
But beefing up our defenses can only buy some time,

64
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,360
not a long-term solution.

65
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,670
Based on the sandbox,

66
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,269
their troop has to be in a long line.

67
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:17,600
Although they are massive,

68
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,829
but difficult to be dispatched.

69
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,440
There is no way to

70
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,600
form a ring of encirclement in a short time.

71
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:22,720
Dad,

72
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,880
I think

73
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,160
we can do more raids

74
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,110
to repel them.

75
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,160
So we can defeat them by some surprise actions.

76
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:39,110
Several generals of South Desolation
were lost in recent days.

77
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:41,350
Rong's tactic

78
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,920
has achieved initial success.

79
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,830
But this tactic should not be used anymore.

80
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,880
They will reinforce their defense at the passes.

81
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,270
The key of this tactic

82
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,390
lies in keeping moving to attack them.

83
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,350
Did you forget

84
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,320
I'm the King Pirate?

85
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,950
This is the narrowest part of Heng River.

86
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,720
You're not gonna swim out

87
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,920
and attack the camp at night, are you?

88
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,950
Go!

89
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,720
Nice.

90
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,790
Very nice.

91
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,320
Recently,

92
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,480
there have been much good news.

93
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:11,200
The outer forces of South Desolation's troop

94
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,720
have been breached.

95
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,550
Anxious to defend,

96
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,270
they have redeployed their defense grid.

97
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,950
Their pace of frontal attacks

98
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,760
also slowed down.

99
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,440
Without Rong' command at the base camp,

100
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,390
I just a knife without a blade.

101
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,270
Of course.

102
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:27,880
Report!

103
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,350
General Hua,

104
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:31,110
here's your letter.

105
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,159
Ok, you can leave.

106
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:32,600
Yes, my lord.

107
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,159
Rong, Cheng,

108
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:42,070
there's something I almost forgot to tell you.

109
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,440
Last time I escorted Sixth Princess to Jingcheng,

110
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,159
I met with the Emperor.

111
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,550
The Emperor has entrusted me

112
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,880
with the task of contacting with the Night-Wolf.

113
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:52,790
Dad,

114
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,720
who's the Night-Wolf?

115
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,920
I don't know, either.

116
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,390
He only offers information,

117
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:01,070
and doesn't associate with any people.

118
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,390
I think

119
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,480
it's the best way

120
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,040
to protect his identity.

121
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:07,920
That makes sense.

122
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,950
The information from the Night-Wolf

123
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,480
is critical.

124
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,000
Duanmu Qingcang cannot hold back anymore,

125
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:18,070
they decided to launch an attack.

126
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,000
Tonight Duanmu Qingcang

127
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,830
will personally lead hundreds of elite troops

128
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,480
to Guan Mountain

129
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,720
behind Tianchu's barracks.

130
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,270
Using the wind to launch a fire attack.

131
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,880
To coordinate the army's

132
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,200
assault across the river.

133
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:37,640
They wanna attack us front and rear.

134
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,040
This is a good opportunity.

135
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:41,640
Dear father-in-law,

136
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:44,600
you lead the army in the front line.

137
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,480
I'll take an elite force

138
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,480
to ambush in the rear.

139
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,830
As long as the Duanmu Qingcang captured alive,

140
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,920
we will win.

141
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:16,830
My Lord,

142
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,480
Duanmu Qingcang has so many soldiers.

143
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,000
Is it dangerous for us

144
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
to fight more with less?

145
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,160
Zhang,

146
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:23,920
don't be freaking out!

147
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,040
Well, at least he's our relative,

148
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,000
we're gonna be all right.

149
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,550
Aren't we, my lord?

150
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,840
If all goes well with this action,

151
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:43,640
Cheng will surely

152
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,710
defeat Duanmu Qingcang!

153
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,110
Report!

154
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:50,520
General Hua,

155
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,550
something happened!

156
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:53,030
According to General Hua Jr.'s order,

157
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,000
I secretly arranged scouts

158
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,470
to monitor South Desolation's barracks,

159
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:58,110
but a scout in the southeast was killed.

160
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,880
He sent back a message before death that

161
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,710
there was an army of thousands of men

162
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:03,110
has left South Desolation's barracks secretly.

163
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,030
Dad,

164
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,910
it seems that the fire attack is a feint,

165
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:06,910
actually it's a trap!

166
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:07,960
Qin Shangcheng is in danger.

167
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,550
I'll gather my cavalry at once and go to save him!

168
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,230
Wait a minute!

169
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:10,840
Rong,

170
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:14,230
Duanmu Qingcang is wily.

171
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,230
Maybe he figured it out already.

172
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,960
If you move your army out of barracks now,

173
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,470
that's exactly what the enemy wants!

174
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:21,960
Once barracks are breached,

175
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,550
the consequences are unimaginable!

176
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:24,320
Dad,

177
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:25,960
then what about Qin Shangcheng?

178
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,200
Rong,

179
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,520
Cheng is Duanmu Qingcang's biological son.

180
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,080
I think

181
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,710
he would never hurt Cheng.

182
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,280
Giddyap!

183
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,030
Giddyap!

184
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,320
Whoa!

185
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,550
Why are you two the only ones back?

186
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,320
Where's Qin Shangcheng?

187
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,030
Your highness,

188
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:04,230
we were tricked.

189
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,200
Qing Shangcheng,

190
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:09,710
today's battle

191
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,000
is to test

192
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,350
your qualification to be my son.

193
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,790
In this case,

194
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:16,840
you are not qualified enough.

195
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,080
Release my soldiers.

196
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:29,320
Release my brothers.

197
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,670
I'll go with you.

198
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,350
My lord was captured alive by Duanmu Qingcang

199
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,960
for saving us.

200
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:36,030
Your highness,

201
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,280
I'm gonna assembly our army

202
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,000
Go get the lord.

203
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,590
Wait!

204
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:40,760
You go back now and you die.

205
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,470
Qin Shangcheng should be all right.

206
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:48,320
Rong,

207
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,000
this is inevitable.

208
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,280
Father and son

209
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,670
have to face each other.

210
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,640
Report!

211
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:01,880
General Hua,

212
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:03,960
someone shot a letter to the barracks.

213
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:07,200
Rong.

214
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,280
Duanmu Bai.

215
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:28,590
Hua Rong.

216
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,960
You have the nerve to meet us!

217
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:31,030
Have you forgotten

218
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,150
what you promised my lord?

219
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:32,910
Qian Dayou,

220
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,030
I did fail to keep my promise,

221
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,640
but I tried my best.

222
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,470
Hua Rong,

223
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,840
I come to you

224
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,470
to tell you a message.

225
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:42,910
Qin

226
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,110
has been taken overnight back to Mu's Palace,

227
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,230
and under house arrest in the Tianchi Pavilion.

228
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,280
How do we know

229
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:50,760
this isn't your trap?

230
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,350
Grandma

231
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,520
may be the only hope to save Qin.

232
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,910
I have written the birth story of me and Qin

233
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,790
in the letter.

234
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,080
And this

235
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:09,470
will give you free access

236
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,200
to the Mu's Palace.

237
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,400
Thank You.

238
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:21,910
Say sorry for me

239
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:24,840
when you see Qin.

240
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,840
Is what Bai says

241
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,320
in his letter true?

242
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:42,200
Empress Dowager,

243
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,760
Qin Shangcheng is indeed your grandson.

244
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:45,760
And,

245
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,840
I'm pregnant with your great-grandchild.

246
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:49,840
Your Highness,

247
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,640
are you really pregnant?

248
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,110
Lord must be happy to know it!

249
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:52,640
Yes!

250
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,350
Stand up.

251
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,280
I'm okay.

252
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,000
Empress Dowager,

253
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,110
don't take the girl's word for it.

254
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,960
It's hard to tell the letter from the truth,

255
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:12,840
so it's better to leave the matter to My Majesty.

256
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:13,840
Empress Dowager,

257
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,350
Qin Shangcheng is held in the Tianchi Pavilion now.

258
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,080
If you don't trust me,

259
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,200
you can check him out any time.

260
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,200
I and my baby are also

261
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,640
on your hands now.

262
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:24,590
Great.

263
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,710
I'd love to see

264
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:29,880
what else you can pull off.

265
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,000
I won't, Empress Dowager.

266
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,840
Qin Shangcheng!

267
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:43,880
My Lord!

268
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,440
Qin Shangcheng!

269
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:46,400
- My Lord!
- Qin Shangcheng!

270
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:46,910
Lord!

271
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:48,840
What's with the rash?

272
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:52,470
Qin Shangcheng!

273
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:53,470
White fernwort!

274
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,000
Duanmu's whole family

275
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
from ancestor are allergic to white fernwort.

276
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,080
Bai doesn't.

277
00:13:59,080 --> 00:13:59,520
Why...

278
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:00,640
Qin Shangcheng.

279
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,520
Who did this?

280
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,200
Such things

281
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,320
are not allowed in Mu's Palace!

282
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,320
Who did this?

283
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,470
Mother,

284
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,280
it's me.

285
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,760
Why didn't you tell me

286
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,910
about it?

287
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:17,760
And you even use white fernwort

288
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,910
to poison my grandson!

289
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,640
Mother,

290
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,110
I had to do this

291
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,030
to know

292
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,030
if he is my son

293
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,880
and your grandson?

294
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,080
As an emperor.

295
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,350
I can't only follow one's words

296
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:32,550
to adopt a son.

297
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:33,880
Now,

298
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,790
it has been confirmed that

299
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,880
Qin Shangcheng

300
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:38,030
is truly my son.

301
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:40,030
Now I dare to tell you.

302
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:41,960
So what are you

303
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,030
gonna do next?

304
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:44,840
Are you just gonna

305
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,710
keep them locked up forever?

306
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,200
Mom,

307
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,790
Qin Shangcheng was born in Tianchu,

308
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,000
and married the daughter of a general of Tianchu.

309
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,520
He was my enemy on the battlefield.

310
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,200
It was the worst offense!

311
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:00,520
I locked him up

312
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,790
so he could understand who is his father

313
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:03,840
and what to do

314
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,710
and which side should he be on!

315
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,350
What I'm doing now

316
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:08,440
is trying to

317
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,670
make him worthy of

318
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:11,080
being my son.

319
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:14,790
Tianchu had nurtured him,

320
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:17,200
and it was excusable

321
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,790
if he could not change his position for a while.

322
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:20,150
In addition,

323
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,790
Cheng's wife

324
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,760
has already been pregnant.

325
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,520
Is it true??

326
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,080
I am a father now?

327
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:36,640
Yes.

328
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:45,520
I am so excited.

329
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,440
I almost forgot.

330
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,350
I almost hurt you and the baby.

331
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,520
Sit down, please.

332
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,030
I am fine.

333
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,640
I'm the same

334
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,200
as before.

335
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,000
Don't! No!

336
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,080
It can't be the same.

337
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,200
Now you are more precious than before.

338
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,590
But why did you hide it from me?

339
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,670
Chi Hong told me that

340
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,280
there's a rule among your pirates that

341
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,000
a woman can't tell her husband this news

342
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,230
in the first three months.

343
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:10,320
Nonsense!

344
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,520
I've been a pirate for such a long time

345
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,590
and I've never heard that before!

346
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:12,960
Exactly!

347
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,670
I haven't heard of it either!

348
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,760
Chi Hong is so unreliable.

349
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,030
It's nonsense...

350
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,320
Qin Shangcheng,

351
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,440
are you angry?

352
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,670
I am blaming myself.

353
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,760
Let you alone to make a risk to South Desolation.

354
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,550
I'm worried about you and the baby.

355
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,000
That's my lord!

356
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,760
A little pirate is about to be born!

357
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,710
It's mini Yunhe who's about to make a splash!

358
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,640
Yes, yes.

359
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:36,910
What are you guys still here?

360
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:39,670
My lord,

361
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,230
there's only one room here.

362
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,080
Don't worry, my lord.

363
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,320
Zhang Xian and I will be the blind

364
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,880
and the deaf!

365
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,350
Yes!

366
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,000
Can't listen and see.

367
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:51,590
Rong,

368
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,440
now,

369
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,520
I just want our baby to be safe.

370
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:56,910
After he is born,

371
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,080
in this world

372
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,520
I will have one more person to love.

373
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,000
So

374
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,320
who do you love best?

375
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,920
I love you as much as baby.

376
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,000
It's correct.

377
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,920
Actually, I wanted to tell you about it.

378
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,069
But I was afraid that if I tell you,

379
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:12,589
you'll be too worried

380
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,880
to go to the front.

381
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,760
Qin Shangcheng,

382
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,589
now you are the only one

383
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:19,310
who can stop the war

384
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,280
and bring about peace talks between
South Desolation and Tianchu.

385
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,920
Anyway, we're in the Mu's Palace now.

386
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,760
You and I will take advantage of
this opportunity to do it.

387
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:30,430
Okay.

388
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,070
Cheng.

389
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,350
Cheng.

390
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,560
Are you feeling better now?

391
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:39,710
Grandma,

392
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:40,830
he's much better now.

393
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:41,950
That's great.

394
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,350
When I met you last time,

395
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,000
I thought

396
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,640
this young man was spirited

397
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,710
and handsome.

398
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,920
There was a sense of kinship.

399
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,760
I didn't expect that you are my grandson.

400
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,400
Qin Shangcheng.

401
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:04,920
Grandma.

402
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,230
Grandma,

403
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,280
do you know

404
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,590
why did His Majesty suddenly return today?

405
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,760
Your father came back

406
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,920
to tell me about your lot.

407
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,040
Now South Desolation and Tianchu are at war.

408
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,470
It's about the future of both countries.

409
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,760
Your father can't let you out yet.

410
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,760
But your father has promised me that

411
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,070
your wife

412
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:31,680
must be cared for by me.

413
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,830
Thanks a lot, grandma.

414
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,560
It may not be a bad idea.

415
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,640
I first go out,

416
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,800
and then play the martyr with the baby

417
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,160
and then save Qin Shangcheng out.

418
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,280
Take more.

419
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,520
What's wrong? Not your cup of tea?

420
00:18:58,950 --> 00:18:59,800
Grandma,

421
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:02,160
these dishes are certainly palatable.

422
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,830
But

423
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:06,190
the baby in my womb wants my hometown's food,

424
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,680
especially the eel noodles

425
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,190
made by my husband.

426
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:13,110
I knew that

427
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,920
you are pregnant and have a bad appetite.

428
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,640
So I got you a cook from Tianchu ahead of time.

429
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,310
Well,

430
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:22,950
asking the kitchen to make a bowl of eel noodles.

431
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:23,470
Yes.

432
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,110
Thanks, grandma.

433
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,950
How can I save Qin Shangcheng?

434
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,000
Have it, Rong.

435
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:45,760
Have it.

436
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:46,920
I will.

437
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:49,190
Qin Shangcheng!

438
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:50,710
Where are you?

439
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:51,830
Where?

440
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,640
Qin Shangcheng!

441
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,000
Rong.

442
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,470
Grandma.

443
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:57,280
What's wrong?

444
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:57,920
Rong.

445
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,190
Since Qin Shangcheng was not with me,

446
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:01,800
I have nightmares every night,

447
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,110
worrying about something will happen to my baby.

448
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:05,920
Rong,

449
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:09,350
I went to the temple yesterday

450
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:11,280
to pray for you and your baby,

451
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,880
and I even get you an amulet.

452
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,310
Have a look.

453
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,070
Just put it under your pillow

454
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,710
and you can fall asleep.

455
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:24,680
You don't have to worry about

456
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,590
those nightmares.

457
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,800
But grandma, I still...

458
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,070
But what?

459
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,400
I'll sleep with you if you want.

460
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,070
Okay.

461
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:40,040
Grandma,

462
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,310
I heard that dad need to communicate more
with his baby during pregnancy.

463
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,430
In this way, father and son will not

464
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:46,470
be at odds with each other.

465
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,520
I don't want to

466
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,800
go the way of Qin Shangcheng and Your Majesty.

467
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,680
That makes sense.

468
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,190
You agree?

469
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,160
Cheng,

470
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,920
now you can start talking.

471
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:03,400
I and Rong and your baby are all listening.

472
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,000
You can start.

473
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:05,920
I...

474
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,310
Go on!

475
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:09,430
Daodao, my baby.

476
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,400
Daddy wants to be with you every day.

477
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:13,830
Go on.

478
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,110
Write them down.

479
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:16,920
Go on.

480
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:18,710
Daodao, my baby.

481
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,710
Daddy wants to be with you every day.

482
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,800
That's it?

483
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,310
Say something else.

484
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:28,680
Say something more.

485
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,710
Daddy wants to be with you every day.

486
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,950
Looks like grandma can't help me.

487
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:44,310
I have to find another way.

488
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,280
What place this is?

489
00:21:58,470 --> 00:21:59,520
Who lives here?

490
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,830
This is the late empress's sleeping palace.

491
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,880
Today is the birthday of the late empress.

492
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,070
For 25 years,

493
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,350
on this day,

494
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:08,280
Your Majesty orders to clean here for a memorial.

495
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,190
May I have a look inside?

496
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:13,310
No.

497
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,110
Miss Hua,

498
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:16,590
Your Majesty forbids an outsider to go inside.

499
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,830
How could I be an outsider?

500
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,470
The late empress is my mother-in-law.

501
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:23,590
Miss Hua,

502
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,160
Everything in the late empress's sleeping palace

503
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:27,230
is in exactly the same position

504
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:29,280
as it was twenty-five years ago.

505
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:31,710
His Majesty would be furious

506
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:33,190
if he found anyone had touched it.

507
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:34,190
My dear, don't worry.

508
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,470
I know it.

509
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:36,400
I won't cause you any trouble.

510
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,000
Any wrong can be blamed on me.

511
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:39,070
Wanjiang Fulong Shoe shop in Yi-Chou year.

512
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,190
Yi-Chou year...

513
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:43,400
Your Majesty.

514
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:01,230
Mu Qing,

515
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:03,920
after 25 years,

516
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,230
I finally found him.

517
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:10,000
His personality is quite like mine.

518
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,110
He would rather break

519
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,430
than bend.

520
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,040
For so many years,

521
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,920
I have been thinking that

522
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,110
in that year

523
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:20,160
if I had not insisted on

524
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,430
expanding the north after assaulting Wanjiang,

525
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:24,160
there would have been no siege at Mount Xixia.

526
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,950
And you will not be victimized by evildoers.

527
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:27,040
I and my son

528
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:29,590
wouldn't be strangers.

529
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:35,310
Mu Qing,

530
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:37,230
for 25 years,

531
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:40,310
do you have any idea how much I've missed you?

532
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,280
Your Majesty.

533
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,640
Hua Rong?

534
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:49,680
Your Majesty.

535
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:51,230
What are you doing here?

536
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,400
I have heard everything you just said.

537
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,950
Therefore, in your heart,

538
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:57,160
there is a father-son affection for Qin Shangcheng.

539
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,640
I asked you what are you doing here?

540
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,880
I just saw Wanjiang Fulong Shoe shop
in Yi-Chou year

541
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:03,190
on those shoes.

542
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,000
I guess

543
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:05,560
that was the year

544
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,590
of Your Majesty's northern expanding to the Wanjiang.

545
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,350
It's also the year my husband was born in.

546
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:10,160
Hua Rong,

547
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,640
I don't want to hear these from you.

548
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,950
Although Your Majesty was away at the war,

549
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,110
you were still concerned about your pregnant wife.

550
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,920
You went out to buy those shoes specially.

551
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,520
But you did not expect

552
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,280
you couldn't see the last of her.

553
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:30,070
It's easy to kill a man

554
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:31,470
but hard to change his mind.

555
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:34,560
You are the daughter of Hua Mantian

556
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:36,400
who is a good mind reader.

557
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:38,680
Your Majesty.

558
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:40,230
Actually,

559
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,470
before the late empress married you,

560
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:44,680
she knew that you were too ambitious

561
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:46,920
to be an ordinary husband.

562
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,190
And she can't get the love and care of

563
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:51,350
her husband like other ordinary women.

564
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:54,000
But the late empress is sure to be

565
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,560
deeply grieved to see you two

566
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,400
estranged,

567
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,350
and even fighting each other.

568
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:00,000
Your Majesty,

569
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,920
Qin Shangcheng from childhood drifted
from place to place,

570
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,350
and has no day to enjoy the love of parents.

571
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,070
I don't want my baby

572
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,560
to have the same experience.

573
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:17,590
For missing the late empress,

574
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,590
The Emperor decided to pardon Mr. Qin.

575
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:22,710
Please go to the dining hall for a meeting.

576
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:25,520
My lord,

577
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:27,070
this can't be

578
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:28,230
Hongmenyan
[*A dinner at Hongmen where treachery that was planned.]

579
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:29,110
You're reading too much into it.

580
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:30,280
It must be her highness.

581
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:30,920
Isn't it, my lord?

582
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,040
Who cares what he wants?

583
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:33,350
Roll with

584
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:34,590
the punches.

585
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,280
Yes sir.

586
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:37,920
Your Majesty,

587
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,430
you finally figured it out.

588
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,520
This time our family

589
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,110
can finally have a good meal.

590
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:46,800
Yes.

591
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:48,280
Cheng,

592
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,640
here will be

593
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:50,920
your home from now on.

594
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,760
I'm too busy

595
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:54,350
to accompany you,

596
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,590
so you have to stay here alone.

597
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:59,830
Those walls can't stop me.

598
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,280
Rong is the only one

599
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:02,950
who can.

600
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,560
That's what your mother said back before.

601
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:07,800
She couldn't be trapped

602
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,160
in this big house.

603
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,590
But now,

604
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,000
Rong is pregnant.

605
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,160
I think you as a husband

606
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:16,710
can't

607
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:19,470
leave your wife and child behind.

608
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,000
For sure.

609
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:25,350
I want Rong to accompany for more time with me.

610
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,710
Tell you that

611
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:28,190
the kohlrabi and radish

612
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:29,880
are pickled by me.

613
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:31,110
Cheng,

614
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,520
have a try.

615
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:33,800
Try it.

616
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:35,350
Ok.

617
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,830
How about? Is it tasty?

618
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:45,070
- Yes!
- Is it tasty?

619
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:48,000
Grandpa must

620
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,310
have loved

621
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,520
grandma's cooking.

622
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,710
In those days...

623
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:57,520
In those days, Wanjiang invaded

624
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,950
to attack South Desolation.

625
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:02,110
I followed your grandpa to escape with your father.

626
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,710
There is no grain in the mountains.

627
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:07,830
We have to dig some kohlrabies and turnips to eat.

628
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,160
These vegetables saved

629
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:13,040
our Duanmu family.

630
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,110
This was true even for the nobility,

631
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,800
not to mention the people of the frontier.

632
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,430
Not one out of ten people survived.

633
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:19,950
It's hard to survive,

634
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,800
let alone feed themselves.

635
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:25,190
I don't want temporary peace

636
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:27,350
or stability in a corner,

637
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:29,230
but I want the whole world to be united

638
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,160
and the border areas to be free from trouble.

639
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,110
Your Majesty has sieged Tianlu City for a long time without success.

640
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,560
The unification of the world

641
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:39,000
is nothing but a quixotic dream.

642
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:43,760
If you're so sure,

643
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,830
do you want to

644
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,070
bet on it?

645
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,190
As you wish.

646
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:52,190
If South Desolation

647
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:53,230
takes Tianlu City within half a month.

648
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:54,350
Then you,

649
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:55,950
from then on,

650
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,110
have to stay here.

651
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,310
What if it doesn't?

652
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:06,710
If I lose,

653
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:09,070
you and Rong

654
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:12,470
can leave South Desolation safe and sound.

655
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,830
Will you keep your promise?

656
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,310
Yes, I will.

657
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:16,760
All right, all right.

658
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:18,400
You two,

659
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,680
don't argue about the family or the world,

660
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,190
much less the war or the peace.

661
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:26,950
Just finish this meal first,

662
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:27,710
could you?

663
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:28,680
Yes, mom.

664
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,310
Could you?

665
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,310
Yes, grandma.

666
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:32,310
Let's start!

667
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:41,950
Duanmu Qingcang is so sure

668
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:42,520
within half a month

669
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,880
to break Tianlu City,

670
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,040
he must have a plan.

671
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,070
Don't worry, my lord.

672
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:48,070
Don't you forget

673
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:50,590
Duanmu Qingcang has our spy

674
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,640
the Night-Wolf with him?

675
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,830
I'm sure he'll pass the information on to General Hua,

676
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:54,230
right?

677
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,160
Maybe.

678
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:57,350
I'm afraid the Night-Wolf won't make a move now.

679
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:59,230
The last time the Night-Wolf let out

680
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,230
Duanmu Qingcang's route of transporting grain,

681
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:01,350
which led to their retreat,

682
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,950
so now he must have been alert.

683
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:05,230
That is why in the Battle of Guanshan,

684
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:07,280
he could pass false information to us
on the pretext of the Night-Wolf

685
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,070
which caused that we were tricked

686
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:09,110
and you were captured.

687
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:11,760
This grandson is a real snake!

688
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,350
Qian,

689
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:16,430
you scold Duanmu Qingcang is a grandson.

690
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,680
Lord is his son,

691
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:19,920
then...

692
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:24,950
My lord,

693
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,640
I didn't mean that.

694
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,560
I mean,

695
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:31,230
grandfathers grow up from grandsons.

696
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,070
You must be able to make progress steadily

697
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:36,040
and defeat Duanmu Qingcang.

698
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:37,400
Shut up!

699
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,680
Your words are absolutely right.

700
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,950
But it won't be easy for the Night-Wolf

701
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:45,470
to send us messages.

702
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,710
The Night-Wolf is our only shot right now,

703
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:49,640
so anyway

704
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,760
we have to try it.

705
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:52,710
So the most important thing now

706
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:54,400
is to try to contact the Night-Wolf.

707
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,590
Do you remember

708
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:01,800
that letter?

709
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,590
Duanmu Qingcang has our spy with him.

710
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,950
As soon as he gets word on the grain route,

711
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:14,470
he'll drop the message off
at the corner of Springback Hall,

712
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,190
marking it with abutilon pictum.

713
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:23,710
Your Majesty.

714
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:29,190
Your Majesty, do you intend to use
Qin Shangcheng as bait

715
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,430
to lure out Tianchu's spy hidden in the court?

716
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:34,070
You are the one

717
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,070
who knows me best.

718
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,830
It's my pleasure, Your Majesty.

719
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:40,160
As the captain of the Shadow Guard,

720
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:42,110
I'm supposed to help Your Majesty out.

721
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:43,040
Then you tell me

722
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:44,950
how will you

723
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,400
help me out?

724
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,920
Now the three countries, South Desolation,
Wanjiang and Tianchu,

725
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:52,430
all have good timing, geographical convenience
and supported people.

726
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,280
But Wanjiang and Tianchu could only
check and balance each other,

727
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:56,680
not enough to unify.

728
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,190
We South Desolation is different.

729
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,950
Your Majesty has been secretly working
on the powerful cannon.

730
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:02,310
Once succeed,

731
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,470
Your Majesty must unify the world.

732
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,950
I see you've

733
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,430
been reading my mind a lot.

734
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:12,280
Tianchu's spy is hidden in the court.

735
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,040
Your Majesty is afraid of his threat to our cannon,

736
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,590
so you want to use Qin Shangcheng
to eliminate the spy.

737
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,190
Although

738
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:20,680
it's a good plan,

739
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,040
I'm afraid Qin Shangcheng won't take it.

740
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,710
Do you know

741
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,590
how to catch a big fish?

742
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:29,710
I don't know.

743
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:32,230
Men, like fish,

744
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,430
are cautious by day

745
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:37,350
and fearless by night.

746
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,280
So the only way to catch a big fish

747
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,590
is to make him bold.

748
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:46,430
Got it.

749
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:06,190
It's here. Here.

750
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:07,830
Qian,

751
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,280
so,

752
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:08,800
what,

753
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,230
what should we do?

754
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,950
Go to the corner.

755
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,040
Okay?

756
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,000
Qian,

757
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:34,280
done.

758
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,160
Should we wait here?

759
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,400
Are you stupid?

760
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,560
Do you want to be found here?

761
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,160
Come back tomorrow.

762
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:39,590
Let's go.

763
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:21,040
It's you!

764
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:36,800
Your Majesty,

765
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,600
I'm going to get rid of this spy now.

766
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,560
Wait a minute.

767
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,429
He

768
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:44,000
must be killed.

769
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,670
But now is not the time.

770
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:49,040
There is no need to alarm them.

771
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,150
So what Your Majesty is saying is

772
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,760
this false message still needs to be
delivered by Zou Yitian.

773
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,760
The messenger is sent by Zou Yitian,

774
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,280
but the culprit

775
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:01,600
is Qin Shangcheng.

776
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:05,040
The message is vital to the whole war.

777
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:07,560
If the message from Qin Shangcheng can
lead to a major defeat for Tianchu,

778
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,000
he will become a sinner in Tianchu,

779
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:11,150
and fall into a helpless state.

780
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,150
At that time,

781
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:14,870
Qin Shangcheng will naturally return to
the South Desolation.

782
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:21,840
My lord truly knew what was going on!

783
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,150
The Night-Wolf put this secret letter

784
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:24,040
at the corner.

785
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:34,190
The letter said that

786
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:35,950
the South Desolation

787
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:38,080
planned to attack Xunyang,

788
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:38,840
Shaoguan,

789
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,120
and Rongcheng, these three cities.

790
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:41,360
In fact...

791
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,150
I see, my lord!

792
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,600
In fact, it is a false shot!

793
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,360
They will feint

794
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,080
to weaken Tianlu City's forces,

795
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,430
and take it down in one fell swoop!

796
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:47,870
Am I right, Your Highness?

797
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:49,000
They will make a feint to somewhere
and attack in another place.

798
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,470
I'll have to inform my dad

799
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:51,950
to get all the troops

800
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:53,320
to defend Tianlu City,

801
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,470
and give them a blow.

802
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:57,800
Cheng,

803
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,520
The half-month bet is about to get a result.

804
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,470
Do you think

805
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:02,910
you can win?

806
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,430
The battle report hasn't come back yet.

807
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,800
It's too early to tell anything.

808
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:11,320
Scouts are on their way back.

809
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:13,870
I'll make you lose in no time.

810
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,840
But before that,

811
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,600
there's one thing we need to solve.

812
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:21,630
Take him here.

813
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,320
Lieutenant Zou?

814
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,040
He has another name,

815
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:32,320
Night-Wolf.

816
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,390
So you've been using us

817
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:38,150
to find the Night-Wolf.

818
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:39,360
Without you,

819
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,800
I wouldn't have found him,

820
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:43,150
and I couldn't pass the false message

821
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,560
to your father.

822
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:48,280
I should appreciate you for this.

823
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,670
Zou Yitian.

824
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,120
Night-Wolf.

825
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,190
I have always treated you well.

826
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,470
But you?

827
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,150
So,

828
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:10,630
Any last words

829
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,390
before you die?

830
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:14,910
I know

831
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,670
in these years

832
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,430
Your Majesty treated me so nice

833
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:20,950
and valued me.

834
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,320
I am grateful,

835
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:25,600
and also feel so guilty.

836
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:28,150
But I am from Tianchu.

837
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,520
I can only fight for Tianchu.

838
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:32,390
Although I will die,

839
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:34,320
I'm not regretful.

840
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,630
Okay.

841
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:41,870
I'll help you die.

842
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,360
Wait a moment!

843
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,760
It's my order!

844
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,080
Who dares disobey!

845
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:49,230
Anyone who intercedes with him today

846
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:51,360
will be treated as high treason!

847
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:52,630
How dare you!

848
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,040
Mom?

849
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:57,120
I'll see who will hurt my grandson and his wife.

850
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:00,670
Didn't you go to Lingchan Temple to pray?

851
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,040
I knew that

852
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:04,520
you must get a plot

853
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,000
for pardoning Cheng.

854
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,710
You let me down.

855
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:09,950
Mom.

856
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:12,710
You took advantage of your own son!

857
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:13,520
Mom, you...

858
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,360
I'm telling you

859
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,840
I have to protect my grandson and his wife

860
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:19,470
even if I have to die today!

861
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:20,430
- Report!
- Mom...

862
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:22,760
Your Majesty,

863
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,800
The armies besieging Xunyang,

864
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,430
Shaoguan and Rongcheng

865
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:26,670
are besieged by the armies of Tianchu!

866
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:29,470
What!

867
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,840
My lord. My lord.

868
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,390
The first step in having a baby

869
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:53,080
is to have a strong body.

870
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,040
Next,

871
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:55,840
you see,

872
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,190
a strong young man like you,

873
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:57,870
with powerful kungfu,

874
00:38:57,870 --> 00:38:58,760
must have

875
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,670
a healthy baby.

876
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:00,150
He must be as energetic

877
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:00,870
as me.

878
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:02,950
Cut the cackle.

879
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:03,870
What's the second?

880
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:05,910
The second

881
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:06,520
is actually...

882
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,520
My lord! My lord!

883
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,150
Look at

884
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:08,800
this!

885
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,430
Good rice flower liquor!

886
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:11,430
My lord,

887
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:12,760
I saw you've been running around a lot lately.

888
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,470
Let's have a drink to relax.

889
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:16,430
My lord,

890
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,120
Alcohol is the worst taboo when
preparing for pregnancy.

891
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,950
Alcohol is bad for the brain.

892
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,910
- Take away!
- Take away!

893
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:31,560
My lord...

894
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:31,910
Hurry up!

895
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:32,910
I got this on the market.

896
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:33,760
- Take away!
- Take away!

897
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:36,760
Dayou.

898
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,320
My lord, I'll continue.

899
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,840
I'll give you a prescription

900
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,840
with great nourishing effect.

901
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,320
Then

902
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,470
you will

903
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:46,430
make it.

904
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:51,190
My lord is occupied by him.

905
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:02,360
Zhang,

906
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,000
Zhang, Zhang,

907
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:05,950
what kind of soup did you make?

908
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:07,710
This is the nourishing soup I made for lord.

909
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:09,710
It's an ancestral formula from Doctor Hua.

910
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:10,910
Look,

911
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,710
there are oysters and shrimps,

912
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:13,630
and various of beans.

913
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,320
I believe this will help lord

914
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,280
make it in one shot!

915
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:18,670
Great!

916
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:20,000
Give me some.

917
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:22,190
I made this for my lord.

918
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,800
It's not gonna work for you.

919
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,430
The lord

920
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:26,360
is tired to rush about recently,

921
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,600
and even suffered from eye disease.

922
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,560
He must be weak.

923
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,190
He needs nutrition.

924
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:32,000
But...

925
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:33,520
Who is weak?

926
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:34,280
My lord!

927
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:34,840
My lord.

928
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:35,710
My lord,

929
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:37,040
I didn't mean that.

930
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:38,120
I just thought

931
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,870
you have been married for a long time.

932
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,280
But Miss Hua hasn't been pregnant.

933
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,150
Look at me.

934
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,430
Hui got pregnant

935
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:44,760
soon after our marriage.

936
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,800
So I think you still in recovery

937
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,600
and need this soup

938
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:54,080
I am weak.

939
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:54,910
My lord.

940
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,040
I need the tonic soup?

941
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,670
My lord, I didn't mean that.

942
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:58,230
Only you are strong?

943
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:59,630
My lord, I didn't mean that.

944
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:00,630
My lord!

945
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:01,360
I'm sorry!

946
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:02,840
I'm sorry!

947
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:04,320
It's all mine.

948
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,560
I can have the tonic soup.
