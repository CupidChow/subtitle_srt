3
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,470
The auspicious time has arrived.

4
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,670
Hit the road…

5
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,190
Protect the bride.

6
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,110
Get them.

7
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:28,920
Miss Hua.

8
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,200
You guys, come with me.

9
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,110
The others, stay here.

10
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,720
Miss Hua.

11
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,200
Why are you here?

12
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,760
How come it's you?

13
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,640
Where's Rong?

14
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:03,000
Qin Shangcheng.

15
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,040
Halt.

16
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:27,550
Your Highness.

17
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:28,610
As you ordered.

18
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,000
Here's the bride

19
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:32,000
If Your Majesty asks about it.

20
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,320
Tell him the truth.

21
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:34,350
Be away.

22
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,510
Yes.

23
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:48,600
My father wants to kill you.

24
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,390
For saving you.

25
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,510
I had to do this.

26
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,760
I hope you'll understand me.

27
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:56,950
I know.

28
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,670
You've been wanted to be a chivalrous girl，

29
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,720
to travel around the world.

30
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,070
From now on.

31
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,480
I'd give it all up

32
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,760
to rove across the world with you.

33
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,670
Little White Dove,

34
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,830
would you be willing to elope with me

35
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,670
before sunset?

36
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,040
You're a rainbow in the sky.

37
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,920
I'll follow you along the way.

38
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,920
If you will.

39
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,830
Please accept it.

40
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,270
Why are you, where's Rong?

41
00:06:59,070 --> 00:06:59,830
Your Highness.

42
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,270
We've fallen into the trap.

43
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,550
My lord.

44
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:03,760
As you ordered.

45
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,040
Those who in black outside.

46
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,830
They've been caught up.

47
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,510
What are you guys doing here?

48
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:10,830
My lord has a card up your sleeve.

49
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,230
We'd split up,

50
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,070
and sneaked into South Desolation

51
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,720
to follow his lead anytime.

52
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,720
Shangcheng.

53
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:21,440
You…

54
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,550
For your father-in-law's sake.

55
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:23,720
I've followed him for years.

56
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:25,920
Please cut me some slack.

57
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,790
I was just in the moment of avarice.

58
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:31,270
Cut me some slack.

59
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:33,070
If I do.

60
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:35,440
Will those girls you set up

61
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,270
say yes?

62
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:39,230
How about His Highness who died?

63
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,320
And Tianchu's people?

64
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,000
More than anything.

65
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,760
Rong won't.

66
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:48,230
No... Shangcheng...

67
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,950
This is not I want.

68
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:50,880
It's been imposed upon me.

69
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:51,760
Those girls…

70
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:52,270
Enough!

71
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:57,880
I'll get you where you wanna go.

72
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:00,790
They…

73
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,510
They'd already found out

74
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,830
I've taken refuge in His Royal Highness.

75
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,230
So they set a trap.

76
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:05,510
Leading me…

77
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:06,200
Stop.

78
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:09,920
Here's…

79
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,480
a letter for you.

80
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,550
Your Highness,

81
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:33,000
This is the last Letter from me.

82
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,000
I know what is in your mind.

83
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,909
But I don't want you to bark up the wrong tree.

84
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:41,000
I got married with Qin Shangcheng long before.

85
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,280
There's no place

86
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,520
for anyone else in my heart.

87
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:45,910
So.

88
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,000
Please forget Little White Dove.

89
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,760
You rock! Rong.

90
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,000
I just knocked them out.

91
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:03,910
By the way.

92
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,470
A piece of cake for me.

93
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,470
Think nothing of it.

94
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,000
We need to rendezvous with Qin Shangcheng.

95
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,280
Okay.

96
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:08,790
Go.

97
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:15,110
Rong.

98
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:15,880
Are things all right?

99
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,640
Really well.

100
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:20,030
Qian.

101
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,030
You…

102
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,590
Because I have a similar body type with Your Highness.

103
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:22,960
Look.

104
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:23,880
Qian Dayou.

105
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,150
I'd kick your ass!

106
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,150
Don't stop me.

107
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,400
Qian Dayou.

108
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,080
Are you okay?

109
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,790
Nothing. Your Highness.

110
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:44,670
Don't you forget.

111
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:46,150
I'm your flower guardian.

112
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:52,590
Miss Hua.

113
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,080
I advise you go back and

114
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,400
get marry with Our Highness.

115
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,640
He'll try his best...

116
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,520
To protect you.

117
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,710
What's your problem?

118
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:01,790
Are you on another planet?

119
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,440
Rong is Qin's wife.

120
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,110
Yeah.

121
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,710
The other three of you can go now.

122
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,590
But Miss Hua had to stay here.

123
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:13,880
Or else.

124
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,200
I won't be so easy on you.

125
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,590
I defy whether you can do it.

126
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:22,760
Are you okay?

127
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,320
Can you walk?

128
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,000
Yes.

129
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,590
It hurts.

130
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:31,590
Go.

131
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:33,320
Miss Hua.

132
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:33,960
Wait.

133
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:39,640
Leave it to me.

134
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:43,520
Go. A trick.

135
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:56,960
Your Highness.

136
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,230
Chu Fengling was taken away by Qin Shangcheng and Rong.

137
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,590
Inform Ministry of City Defense.

138
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:03,550
Issue an arrest warrant.

139
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,760
And arrest them across the city.

140
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:07,350
Yes, Your Highness.

141
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:09,320
Let's go.

142
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,590
Where is this?

143
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,000
It's a farmyard near the city gate.

144
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,150
Now, the whole city is on lockdown.

145
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,280
Getting out of the gate is harder than a camel through in the eye of needle.

146
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,520
Qin, the so-called Yunhe,

147
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,590
can't he fly out, too?

148
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,350
There's no way in the sky.

149
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,470
We could pick one underground.

150
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,640
My Lord…

151
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:43,350
My Lord.

152
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,080
Your Highness.

153
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,440
My Lord…

154
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:48,960
Your Highness.

155
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,320
Those girls saved from Utopia

156
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,080
and Miss Xing

157
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,200
all have been sent out

158
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:53,200
through this tunnel.

159
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:54,350
Now,

160
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:55,470
escorted by our people,

161
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:56,840
they must be leaving from Tianchu City soon.

162
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,710
Where's Zhu?

163
00:11:59,150 --> 00:11:59,960
Rong.

164
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,550
I see.

165
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:04,960
This tunnel

166
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,150
must be Zhu's idea.

167
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:06,790
Right?

168
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,110
Thanks. Your Highness.

169
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,710
There will be a reward

170
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:10,960
for everyone who dug this tunnel.

171
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:13,200
Bonus comes out of Dayou's treasury.

172
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:14,760
My Lord.

173
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,110
As saying goes, couple for a day, love forever.

174
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,230
You couldn't screw me over.

175
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:19,790
Dayou.

176
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,960
I got clothes for you.

177
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:21,840
Thanks.

178
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:36,350
Come on.

179
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:44,200
My Lord...

180
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:47,790
Come on.

181
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,470
We got out!

182
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,000
I could tell

183
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Rong and Qin would save me out.

184
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,910
And Qian.

185
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,110
You took an arrow with your buttock.

186
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,000
Give you a merit.

187
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:02,320
For saving the princess,

188
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,150
not to mention a single buttock,

189
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:04,520
both buttocks, I wouldn't mind it.

190
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:05,840
Rong.

191
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,590
Tell me about it.

192
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,640
How did you and Qin do that?

193
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,030
Actually.

194
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,590
Thanks to you and His Highness.

195
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,710
This is what he left.

196
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,710
He must be trying to tell us something

197
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:21,590
by this means.

198
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,520
I see.

199
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,230
The honored guests of Utopia

200
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:30,320
can store things here.

201
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:31,790
The claim check is named after Earthly Branches.

202
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,150
If I'm right.

203
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,280
Those two characters, Gengzi,

204
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,710
refer to his storing site.

205
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,320
There's something wrong with Wang Song.

206
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,320
I've put spy,

207
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,910
at Duanmu Qincang's side.

208
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:00,320
Once getting anything about route for grains.

209
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,000
He'll deliver a message.

210
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,760
It will be put at the street corner near Spring-back Hall,

211
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,400
marked with bluebells.

212
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:12,400
So,

213
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,550
thanks to the spy,

214
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:15,000
we got the route for grains,

215
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,470
and made sure Wang Song is a mole.

216
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,470
We turned his trick against him,

217
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,080
letting him in on our plans

218
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,000
designedly.

219
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,200
Letting his guard down.

220
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:24,470
So Duanmu Qingcang's game was broken.

221
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,030
Well. That is to say...

222
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,640
I can go home,

223
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,520
and see Hui.

224
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:30,960
Yeah.

225
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,710
Let's go home.

226
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:34,840
What a pity.

227
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,960
He'll never come back.

228
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,880
It seems I put my foot in my mouth again.

229
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,080
Dayou.

230
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,760
Why don't you take your candied fruit to comfort her?

231
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,280
Your Highness.

232
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,640
I…

233
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,030
What?

234
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,150
Each spy,

235
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,880
will leave a will.

236
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,520
This is left by His Highness.

237
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:31,910
Your Highness,

238
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,960
I served as a spy,

239
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,440
just for winning the favor of you firstly.

240
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:37,280
But since I really did that,

241
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,400
I found for the country,

242
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,790
I'd not regret a thousand times to die.

243
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,200
If I die,

244
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,350
I only have one wish.

245
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,470
May you meet your true love.

246
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,150
Live up to this life.

247
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:50,350
Nie Yu.

248
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,640
You can do it.

249
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:07,840
Zhu.

250
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,080
Put your mind at ease.

251
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,710
Dayou.

252
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:13,230
He's made it clear.

253
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,520
I'm not stupid.

254
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,640
Why bother?

255
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,320
If...

256
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,640
He does find his true love.

257
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,200
I'll be happy for him.

258
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,440
Rest assured.

259
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,520
You'll meet...

260
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,440
a better man.

261
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:36,670
My Lord.

262
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,080
That isn't pursuers, right?

263
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:39,840
We've left from South Desolation

264
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:41,280
How could there be pursuers?

265
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,400
It must be Deputy City Guard.

266
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,400
General Hua Jr...

267
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:01,280
General Hua Jr.

268
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:04,310
General Hua got the route for grains.

269
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,190
He's sent soldiers to ambush for burning that.

270
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,400
He himself commanded the troop.

271
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,829
They raided the troop camp of South Desolation.

272
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:10,680
Now enemy troops have been taking a beating.

273
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:11,760
They've withdrawn.

274
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:13,230
General Hua ordered me,

275
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,710
to pick you up.

276
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:16,800
I can finally go home.

277
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,190
But before that.

278
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,760
I have a gift for you.

279
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:22,430
It will bring us a happy ending

280
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,710
of our honeymoon.

281
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:25,589
Follow me.

282
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,160
Well, you guys.

283
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,160
See you down there.

284
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,070
All problems have been settled.

285
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,070
I don't want to bother

286
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,310
Rong and Qin.

287
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:40,230
Please...

288
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:41,640
On behalf me,

289
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,160
tell them I've back to Tianchu.

290
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:45,110
Aren't you go to Tianlu City?

291
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,640
I'm now in a different status.

292
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,710
As the head of Fairy Spy Corp,

293
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:49,920
I can't be away for long.

294
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,710
Dayou.

295
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:53,920
Your Highness.

296
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:55,400
And Mr. Zhang.

297
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:56,470
I'm leaving.

298
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:57,680
Take care of yourselves.

299
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:03,880
Wait.

300
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:09,470
Whenever you face difficulties.

301
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:11,160
Don't forget I'm here.

302
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,400
Qian Dayou, your brother.

303
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,190
One call away.

304
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:15,800
Right?

305
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:16,950
Of course.

306
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:18,350
Dayou.

307
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:19,800
Good bye.

308
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,190
Rainbow!

309
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,430
It's beautiful!

310
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,920
I like it.

311
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,680
Such a surprise.

312
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,680
My gift...

313
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,760
It's far beyond the rainbow.

314
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,640
Rong, did you remember?

315
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,800
In Travel Notes of Yunhe.

316
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,310
It recorded...

317
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,350
A kind of speculate, mirage.

318
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:49,190
Yeah.

319
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,560
It said...

320
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,590
There would be a city,

321
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,190
towers, trees, and others.

322
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,830
But it's rare.

323
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,400
Nonetheless,

324
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,520
in South Desolation,

325
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,920
mirage appears frequently.

326
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,760
You mean...

327
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,190
We'll be lucky to have a look at mirage?

328
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,400
Not "have a look".

329
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,310
It's "to be".

330
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:10,280
To be a mirage?

331
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,310
Since we get here.

332
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,920
I've been planning it.

333
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,070
I sent the fellas

334
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:16,880
for information about it.

335
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,680
Day and night.

336
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,350
They figured out

337
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,190
the laws of mirage.

338
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:23,350
Now, it's perfect,

339
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:24,350
both location and time.

340
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:25,590
If nothing goes wrong...

341
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:26,520
If nothing goes wrong...

342
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,830
We've been played out in the sky

343
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,350
over South Desolation.

344
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,000
Right.

345
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:34,520
Rong.

346
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,000
It's a big day that we made our relationship public.

347
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,760
I want everyone in south Desolation  to know.

348
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,920
You are my wife.

349
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,310
Who is that?

350
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,920
They...

351
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,310
The man looks familiar...

352
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,560
Yeah. His face is familiar.

353
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,040
He...

354
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:21,560
He is...

355
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:22,590
He is that...

356
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,520
Yeah. Yeah.

357
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,640
It's him.

358
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,470
That man...

359
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,710
He displayed his awe-inspiring and righteousness,

360
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,400
when Tianchu Mission came here.

361
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,520
Oh, I remember.

362
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,070
Stop.

363
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,110
Miss.

364
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:51,640
You must be General Hua's daughter.

365
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,400
Rong.

366
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:53,230
Yes.

367
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:54,470
Hello?

368
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,470
Surprise?

369
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:56,470
Didn't count on that, right?

370
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:07,310
If there is sunshine.

371
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,190
She'll be always gorgeous.

372
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,310
Little White Dove.

373
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:12,230
Would you like to be my rainbow?

374
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,000
My Lord.

375
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:17,680
Your Royal Highness is back.

376
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:22,710
Stay here.

377
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:50,680
Father.

378
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:52,640
You know

379
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,190
I'm discriminating in one's rewards and punishment.

380
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,310
No exception.

381
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,520
Even though he is my son.

382
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,560
I'm willing to be punished.

383
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:02,880
No complaint.

384
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,230
No complaint?

385
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:11,230
It sounds...

386
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:13,640
You didn't understand it yet.

387
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:15,400
Show no mercy.

388
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:17,470
I all accept.

389
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:20,190
Slow-witted!

390
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,920
This failure...

391
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:25,920
It's caused by your weakness and sentiment.

392
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,430
As per military order,

393
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,310
you should be executed.

394
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,160
Your Royal Highness.

395
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:34,680
Please calm down.

396
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,710
This has nothing to do with My Lord.

397
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:36,680
Who gave your permission here?

398
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,280
Out!

399
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:39,400
For my negligence,

400
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,760
Chu Fengling was snatched.

401
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:41,880
Shut up.

402
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,710
I will take all the fault my own.

403
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:45,000
- Shut up!
- Can you?

404
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:46,760
Father.

405
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,470
Lan Tian takes my order.

406
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,920
If you're into a major event.

407
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:55,430
Don't turn your weakness

408
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,470
into soft spot.

409
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,430
Since you can't get over it yourself.

410
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,680
Let me...

411
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:02,590
help you.

412
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:06,590
I won't kill you now.

413
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:08,520
Just cut off one of your arms.

414
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,640
Wait, Your Royal Highness.

415
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:10,880
Lan Tian.

416
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:13,350
I know my life is worthless.

417
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,280
But I hope...

418
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,000
My death will free My Lord from punishment.

419
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,950
How dare you?

420
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,350
My Lord.

421
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:20,710
Take care yourself.

422
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:22,680
Lan Tian.

423
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,070
Don't touch him.

424
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,000
Soft heart of women.

425
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,350
How to make accomplishments.

426
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:56,430
Dad.

427
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,400
Your Highness.

428
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,880
You're quite welcome!

429
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:10,000
Mr. Hua.

430
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:13,560
Ah. Dad.

431
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,350
No. No rush.

432
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,590
Yan Qing.

433
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,400
General.

434
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,400
Please

435
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,040
get our honored guests settled,

436
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:21,680
they must very tired after a long journey.

437
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,190
Yes,

438
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:22,680
General.

439
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:24,590
Dad.

440
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,110
I have a gift for you.

441
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,470
Sounds great.

442
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,310
Rong.

443
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,520
Come here.

444
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,190
Yeah.

445
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,710
Go. Go.

446
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:36,880
Your Highness,

447
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,350
and honored guests.

448
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,160
Please.

449
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,430
This Eight Treasures Kirin Dagger.

450
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,000
It's the most beloved of your mom.

451
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:07,920
Since she sent it to me,

452
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,830
and I've always took it along with me.

453
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,040
Just like your mom is at my side.

454
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,160
It was stolen by the traitor.

455
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,470
Fortunately, you bring it back.

456
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,400
Otherwise, when seeing your mom.

457
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,400
I don't know how to tell her.

458
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:33,040
What's on a person's face is not always what's in one's heart.

459
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,950
This Wang Song,

460
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,160
the one with a kindly face,

461
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:37,640
followed you for years,

462
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,430
who looked outwardly loyal,

463
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,560
sold women slaves

464
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,920
and a traitor to our country

465
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,470
under the table!

466
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:43,800
That's it.

467
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,280
A scumbag.

468
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:50,110
Alas!

469
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,640
Well...

470
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,160
He got what he deserves.

471
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,190
I finally got you back.

472
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:57,680
Don't talk about him.

473
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,070
Okay.

474
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,230
I'm old.

475
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:03,110
But you've grown up.

476
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:03,880
Besides,

477
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:05,760
you are a swordswoman.

478
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:06,880
You too, dad.

479
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,430
My dad is always vigorous in my heart.

480
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:09,800
For me.

481
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,350
You're a real stand-up man,

482
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:13,000
serving for the state and the people.

483
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,310
Rong.

484
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,920
Have a good rest.

485
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,640
In a few days.

486
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,590
I'll show you around TianLu city.

487
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,190
Enjoy a good time.

488
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:23,000
Ooh! That's great!

489
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,640
Cheng.

490
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,230
Let me show you your room.

491
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:28,950
Okay.

492
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:30,830
Dad.

493
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:32,070
Rong and I...We...

494
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:32,560
Go.

495
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,680
Go. Come on.

496
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:34,830
No...

497
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Wait for me.

498
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,040
Come on.

499
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,520
Cheng.

500
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,070
Look.

501
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:43,920
This is my room.

502
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,710
Bright and spacious.

503
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:47,310
What do you think?

504
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,230
Tonight,

505
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,350
we'll share it.

506
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,430
Dad.

507
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,920
It's...just...one bed?

508
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:58,000
Yeah.

509
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:00,160
Don't worry.

510
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:01,230
I...

511
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:02,800
I don't mind.

512
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:09,070
Cheng.

513
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,070
I didn't take part in

514
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:12,760
your wedding ceremony.

515
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,230
By tradition,

516
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:16,640
you should serve tea and kowtow

517
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,040
to the elderly.

518
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,280
That's what makes it official.

519
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,040
I was thinking of

520
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,430
picking an auspicious day

521
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:26,400
to hold a wedding ceremony.

522
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,520
And then I...

523
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,350
I could marry off my daughter

524
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,040
to you.

525
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,520
I totally agree with you.

526
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,710
Good boy.

527
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:39,950
Good boy.

528
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,190
Dad.

529
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:35,070
Cheng.

530
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:40,190
Why you stay up so late?

531
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:43,040
I'm sleepwalking.

532
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:44,520
Sleepwalking.

533
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,560
Sleep tight...

534
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,680
Go to sleep.

535
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,070
Dad.

536
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,710
Why are you suddenly wake up?

537
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,520
I've been in the field for years,

538
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,520
getting used to

539
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,160
light sleep.

540
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,920
With the slightest noise,

541
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,830
I'd wake up.

542
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,800
Getting used to it.

543
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,310
Cheng.

544
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,590
Time to sleep.

545
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,280
My Lord.

546
00:29:59,280 --> 00:29:59,800
These goji berries,

547
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,710
so bright.

548
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:02,000
The fragrance of osmanthus smells fresh and sweet.

549
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,280
It tells

550
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,560
your heart is with sincerity and warmness.

551
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,110
Right?

552
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,000
It's your turn. Come on.

553
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:11,880
Exactly.

554
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,190
Look at My Lord.

555
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:14,280
Always beyond others.

556
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,470
Cheng.

557
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,560
Dad, morning.

558
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,310
Good boy.

559
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,640
You're so sweet.

560
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,000
So early.

561
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:49,000
You've made breakfast for me.

562
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:50,880
Come on.

563
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,640
Let me taste it.

564
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:58,160
I love them all.

565
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,590
Cheng.

566
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,560
Let me try this.

567
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:08,400
Quite nice.

568
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,470
Cheng.

569
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,160
Sit down and have breakfast with me.

570
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:12,230
No... No.

571
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:13,230
Help yourself.

572
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,160
Dad.

573
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,640
If you like it.

574
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:18,950
I'll make more for you.

575
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:19,880
Nice.

576
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:28,830
My Lord.

577
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:29,400
My Lord.

578
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,280
Finish it so quickly.

579
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,000
My Lord.

580
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,950
What a filial son-in-law.

581
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:50,070
Wake up so early to make breakfast

582
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:50,760
for your father-in-law.

583
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:52,430
Idiot.

584
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:54,560
Clearly it was cut off by the man.

585
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:56,000
You two

586
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,280
From now on.

587
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,520
Keep your eyes on him.

588
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,350
Inform me of

589
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,760
his any moves.

590
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:15,830
My Lord.

591
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,040
My Lord.

592
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:18,590
We saw General Hua

593
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:19,520
got on the carriage

594
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:20,830
for drill ground

595
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:21,560
Yes.

596
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,110
Sure?

597
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:22,830
Sure.

598
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:30,000
Where are you going?

599
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:31,400
Wait, don't follow him.

600
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,800
He's a bit impatient recently.

601
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:34,920
A bit impatient.

602
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,000
Rong.

603
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,110
Rong. Rong. Rong.

604
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:38,470
Such a lovely day.

605
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,760
Let's hang out.

606
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:40,470
No.

607
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,680
My dad asked me to go to the drill ground with him.

608
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:42,470
I gatta go.

609
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,310
See you.

610
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:45,680
I wanna go, too.

611
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,680
Leaving together...

612
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,070
It looks good.

613
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:49,310
Why he's impatient.

614
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:51,800
Zhang,

615
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,950
Aren't you impatient for no seeing Hui for a long time?

616
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,230
No.

617
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,590
Smelling the scent.

618
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,590
Not to mention slightest noise.

619
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:08,949
Even thunder

620
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:10,520
won't wake you up.

621
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:34,670
Stop.

622
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:37,040
Where are you going?

623
00:34:37,429 --> 00:34:39,280
I'll teach you a lesson.

624
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,670
I'll teach you a lesson.

625
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:45,120
Teach you a lesson.

626
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,560
Why are you here?

627
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,040
Didn't you sleep well with my dad?

628
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:05,230
We...

629
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,870
It's not bad.

630
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:07,430
Okay.

631
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:09,630
Rong.

632
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:10,840
Your dad.

633
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,910
When he is going to held the final ceremony for us?

634
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,230
We've been here for days.

635
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:16,390
I'm thinking that

636
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:17,630
since your dad has a busy schedule,

637
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,710
we'd better

638
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:20,040
go back to the island early.

639
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:23,000
I just reunited with my dad.

640
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:23,950
Don't be so hasty.

641
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,230
No. I didn't mean that.

642
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,630
But your dad...

643
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:30,840
He's always keeping me in his sight.

644
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,430
We even never had a whisper.

645
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,360
Look,

646
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,800
for days.

647
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,040
We haven't been out.

648
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:40,950
You're jealous for my dad.

649
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,320
Rong.

650
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:44,390
He's here.

651
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:45,040
Come on, go.

652
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:45,600
No.

653
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,840
I meet my wife.

654
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,840
Why should I hide?

655
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:48,910
No.

656
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:49,430
Come on, from the window.

657
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:50,190
Asleep?

658
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,520
Yeah. Yeah.

659
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,120
Come on.

660
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:52,800
Rong.

661
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:55,430
Rong.

662
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:56,840
Yeah.

663
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:57,840
Coming.

664
00:35:58,950 --> 00:35:59,430
Dad.

665
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:00,710
What's the matter?

666
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:01,520
Dad.

667
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,000
What are you looking for?

668
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,430
My darling.

669
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,470
I'm just afraid Yan Qing...

670
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,080
He is not that thoughtful.

671
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,840
So, I just come and check it.

672
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,280
Cheng.

673
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:31,230
Where did you go?

674
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,470
It's late at night.

675
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,390
There's a little hot in the room.

676
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,670
I just had a relax in the cool yard.

677
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,470
Dad.

678
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:45,870
What makes you wake up again?

679
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:49,280
I...

680
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,520
Sleepwalking.

681
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,320
Can't I?

682
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,360
I'm gonna sleep. Dad.

683
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:28,360
My Lord.

684
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:30,320
I've never seen Hui's dad.

685
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,710
So, I have no a father-in-law.

686
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:32,760
I have no idea

687
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,320
for this matter,

688
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:34,870
right?

689
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:39,840
Thought of my father-in-law...

690
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,560
You wouldn't want the emperor,

691
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,320
to be yours?

692
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:48,950
Forget it. Forget it.

693
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:50,560
Zhang,

694
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:52,760
tell me, even those people like Jin Yiwen and Duanmu Bai,

695
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,280
we can handle them.

696
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:55,120
Think it over,

697
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,230
Hua Mantian, the old guy,

698
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:57,430
we'll manage him easily.

699
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:58,430
You are right.

700
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:03,470
What are you talking about?

701
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,430
Hua is my father-in-law.

702
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:07,870
How can you compare him

703
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:09,600
with Duanmu Bai.

704
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:11,800
My fault, My Lord

705
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,360
My father-in-law...

706
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,390
He is much harder to handle than rivals.

707
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:22,870
Dad, look.

708
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:23,950
Let's have a look there.

709
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,470
It's beautiful.

710
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:26,560
Dad.

711
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,520
Let's go over there.

712
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,320
And here.

713
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:30,760
They look not that good.

714
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:32,430
Let's go.

715
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:34,040
Miss. Watch this sachet.

716
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:34,600
Sachet.

717
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:35,840
Which one do you like?

718
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:36,950
This one.

719
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:37,870
Okay.

720
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:38,950
Dad.

721
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:39,520
It's beautiful?

722
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,320
How about this?

723
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:43,670
Conch.

724
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,190
It must be able to

725
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,360
make sounds of wave.

726
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:48,840
And this one.

727
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:52,910
Sir.

728
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:54,230
Sir. Please give us something to eat.

729
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:55,760
Some food, please.

730
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,080
We are hungry. Sir.

731
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,560
Give us something to eat.

732
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,910
Please give us something to eat.

733
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,840
Being beaten in Tianlu war,

734
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,520
we ceded seven cities to Tianchu.

735
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:25,470
They asked me for a hostage

736
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:27,560
from the royal family.

737
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:30,280
His Majesty outraged to hear that,

738
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:31,670
and wanted to punish Prince Mu's Family.

739
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:33,280
You tell me that

740
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,710
why you'd failed

741
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:35,910
in Tianlu war.

742
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:40,040
The information goes wrong.

743
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:43,040
For us there is no redemption.

744
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,390
Be punished us as you will.

745
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:46,760
Lan Tian,

746
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:48,320
you as the General Duck,

747
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,560
tell me

748
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,800
how should I punish you?

749
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:52,760
As the leader.

750
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:55,190
I'll take all blame.

751
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,430
But please spare my men.

752
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,040
Good.

753
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:02,840
As your will.

754
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:04,320
Father.

755
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,950
Lan Tian followed me since childhood.

756
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:08,150
If you,

757
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:09,600
save him from death.

758
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,230
I...

759
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:12,760
I'm willing to be sent to Tianchu,

760
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:15,080
as the hostage.

761
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,360
Bai.

762
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,390
Did you think it clearly?

763
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:26,630
I made up my mind.

764
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,080
If I could take place of the whole family,

765
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:30,670
to dodge a bullet.

766
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:33,360
I will.

767
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,360
My Lord.

768
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:35,150
No.

769
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,040
Well.

770
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:39,600
Then,

771
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:41,760
Just as you said.

772
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:43,120
Thank you, father.
