Hui is still waiting for me on the island.

172
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:37,320
What Rong really wants

173
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:40,280
is a magnificent wedding ceremony on the island.

174
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,640
I cannot treat her shabbily.

175
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,549
Rather than holding a wedding ceremony hastily,

176
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,110
it is better to figure out

177
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,960
how to make father-in-law come back as a winner.

178
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,110
Qin Shangcheng

179
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,080
Qin Shangcheng

180
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,350
Don't leave me!

181
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,710
Where's the breakfast?

182
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:15,910
Don't buy the man's

183
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,080
shitty sweets!

184
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,030
The thing we discussed last night

185
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,960
should never be revealed to Rong.

186
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,280
Goodbye.

187
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,760
Whom are you writing to?

188
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:33,840
Your Highness

189
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,840
In the morning, we just...

190
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,590
Just wish father-in-law a good health.

191
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,670
You remember to ask a good health to my dad,

192
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:44,110
but you always forget what you have promised me.

193
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,110
Qin Shangcheng

194
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,670
Are you mad at me?

195
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,280
I...

196
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,520
promised you...

197
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,670
You promised to have breakfast with me!

198
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,000
Did you really forget?

199
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,670
Are you really mad at me?

200
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,150
No!

201
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,790
Of course I remember to have breakfast with you!

202
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:57,470
But,

203
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:59,080
I asked them to prepare for a

204
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,350
more delicate one.

205
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:01,640
It's not prepared yet.

206
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,350
It'll be ready for a while. You'll know.

207
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:03,910
Go.

208
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:06,640
Okay.

209
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,000
So many delicious dishes!

210
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,400
How's that?

211
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:15,150
Do you feel your husband's care for you?

212
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,640
This time,

213
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,000
you must believe that I was not mad at you.

214
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:21,590
So, Qin Shangcheng,

215
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:23,280
you still have one thing to do.

216
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,200
Every day, you would do that

217
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,790
for many, many times.

218
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:30,440
Every day?

219
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,080
Many times?

220
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,670
Hasn't it occurred to you now?

221
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,550
I love you.

222
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:41,960
That's more like it.

223
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,910
Do you have a toothache, Rong?

224
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,910
Feed me!

225
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,080
Okay.

226
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:56,840
I'll have this.

227
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,670
Yummy! Yummy!

228
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,400
This!

229
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:04,880
I cannot bear it!

230
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:05,640
Well,

231
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,000
it was already soul-stirring that

232
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,200
Our Lord chased Her Highness.

233
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,080
Why does he still suffer when

234
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,590
he has already got her heart?

235
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:12,590
Dayou, let me tell you.

236
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,760
Actually, women

237
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,960
are all just like her.

238
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,080
When you get married,

239
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:16,910
you'll also be like this.

240
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,000
There's still a long way to go.

241
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,840
Borrow your blessing words.

242
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,470
Let me tell you.

243
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:22,320
If I haven't met such a woman who makes me a moth

244
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,030
darting into the fire,

245
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,470
I would never get on the way.

246
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:25,200
Besides,

247
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,030
women are not as fun as Pai Gow and antique.
[*Pai Gow uses 52 cards plus one joker.]

248
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:27,880
Am I right?

249
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:33,790
Why don't you just believe me?

250
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:13,440
Hui!

251
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,520
Miss!

252
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,320
Let me down!

253
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,200
Let me down!

254
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,400
Be careful!

255
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,470
Did I hurt your stomach, darling?

256
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:25,110
No.

257
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:27,110
Our child is welcoming its daddy

258
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,440
in my stomach!

259
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,400
Baby, be good.

260
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,110
Daddy came back to see you and your mummy.

261
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,000
You should be good inside.

262
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,110
Do not bully your mummy!

263
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,280
It kicked me!

264
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,080
Really?

265
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,200
Listen again.

266
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,470
Did it do it again?

267
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:44,910
I've never expected that

268
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,840
even Zhang Xian would set his affection on others!

269
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,520
My wife doesn't need to envy others.

270
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,320
Come on.

271
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,110
Let me show you a place.

272
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:53,840
Okay.

273
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,550
♪I like your bad, bad look♪

274
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:02,380
♪Your whisper murmuring in my ear♪

275
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,880
♪Those pink, pink rhythms♪

276
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,550
♪have took my heart♪

277
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:10,000
♪I like your bad, bad look♪

278
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,720
♪Bright eyes shine with a smile♪

279
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:18,050
♪Your pure, pure love♪

280
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:19,760
Do you like it?

281
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:25,150
Look.

282
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,030
Our future

283
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,470
is all planned by me.

284
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:29,110
At that time,

285
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,350
let's have two children in three years.

286
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,320
A boy and a girl.

287
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,400
I've thought about it.

288
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,670
At that time,

289
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,670
the infant name of our first kid

290
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,000
is Daodao.

291
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:40,550
Daodao?

292
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:41,760
But...

293
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,280
Daodao sounds so strange.

294
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:47,470
You don't like the name?

295
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,350
If you don't like it,

296
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:49,880
well,

297
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,030
you name it.

298
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:51,840
It all depends on you.

299
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,670
Qin Shangcheng

300
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,030
We haven't been married yet.

301
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,710
How come we have a baby instantly?

302
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,080
You don't know how people on the island

303
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,880
expect us having children.

304
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,440
But I don't have such a long-term plan.

305
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,880
Don't be shy, Rong.

306
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:04,710
My Lord

307
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,880
Oh, Rong.

308
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,590
I just came back to the island.

309
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:14,670
There are still many issues to deal with.

310
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,230
How about that?

311
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,000
You can look around.

312
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,910
Tell me what you are not satisfied,

313
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:17,910
and I'll change them for you.

314
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:20,350
Be good.

315
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,080
I'll come back soon.

316
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,550
Qin Shangcheng

317
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,080
Where are you going?

318
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,790
Qin Shangcheng

319
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:40,960
I'm studying the Outline of Fleet Battle.

320
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,910
There are so many things I don't understand.

321
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:42,960
Could you please teach me?

322
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,230
Outline of Fleet Battle.

323
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,350
These are the notes I took when I read this book.

324
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:47,000
Take it. Have a look.

325
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,440
Okay.

326
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,150
It happens that Dayou and I

327
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,880
are studying maritime defense for Huarong Island.

328
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,320
Dayou

329
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:50,910
I see.

330
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,150
- Then let's study it together.
- Miss Hua

331
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,280
It's better for you to study the Outline.

332
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,000
Excellent!

333
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:54,470
Come on.

334
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,760
- Then the maritime defense...
- It's fine. It's fine.

335
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,230
See you!

336
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:56,960
Defense!

337
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:09,550
What are they doing?

338
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,280
How's our baby?

339
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:16,200
Listen.

340
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,470
How's that?

341
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:22,640
Our baby is so strong!

342
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:25,400
Let me bring several pots of flowers for you.

343
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:33,670
Hope you are well, Your Highness.

344
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:34,320
I'm not well.

345
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,550
Don't come back in two hours.

346
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,670
Goodbye, Your Highness.

347
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,470
Hui

348
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,200
What happened, Rong?

349
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:46,320
Zhang Xian is so kind to you!

350
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,350
No matter how busy he is,

351
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:49,030
he always cares about you!

352
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,960
Isn't Qin also kind to you?

353
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,710
If you ask for A,

354
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:52,760
he dares not give you B.

355
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,760
You see, the date of marriage hasn't set yet.

356
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,840
But the house has been arranged,

357
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,590
and even the baby's room!

358
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:59,670
Just don't mention it!

359
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:00,790
Actually, it seems he thought that

360
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,350
he is the right man I'm going to marry.

361
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:03,000
Therefore,

362
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,550
he prepared for a beautiful house

363
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:06,280
and wants to put me in it for the rest of my life.

364
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,520
And he won't bother anymore!

365
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,550
But he doesn't know what I want at all!

366
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:11,840
Rong

367
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,320
What do you want?

368
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,280
I want...

369
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,640
What I want

370
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,640
is very simple.

371
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:22,350
No matter what condition he is under,

372
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:23,880
we can be together forever.

373
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,320
Wherever he is, there is our home.

374
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,200
Instead of a beautiful house,

375
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,710
or children expected by others.

376
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:29,960
So, Rong,

377
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,910
have you told your thoughts to Qin?

378
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,590
I want to,

379
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,760
but I don't know what happened to him recently.

380
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,400
When we were on the ship,

381
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,790
he seemed to have something else on his mind.

382
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:43,110
Though he talked to me in such a tender way,

383
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,910
he didn't really put his mind on me.

384
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:45,790
He was always perfunctory.

385
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,280
I have an intuition.

386
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,470
Even though I tell him,

387
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:50,520
he would not listen to me.

388
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,790
Hui

389
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:52,840
Do you think

390
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,590
people who are in love at first

391
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:55,520
will end up like this,

392
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,470
that they don't love each other gradually?

393
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,880
Rong

394
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,960
After listening to you,

395
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,000
I understand now.

396
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,710
You two

397
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:05,760
are in a lukewarm period.

398
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,349
Lukewarm period?

399
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,920
Have you and Zhang Xian gone through the period?

400
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,589
Yes.

401
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:11,160
How did you conquer this?

402
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,829
I didn't particularly do anything for this.

403
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:17,680
We just got married as soon as possible,

404
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,520
and then I was pregnant.

405
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:22,109
Zhang Xian is anxious about this.

406
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:23,160
No matter what things to deal with,

407
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,280
he would ask for my opinion.

408
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,040
Then everything goes back to normal.

409
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,430
Rong

410
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:28,400
Why not

411
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,160
giving birth to a baby like me?

412
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,430
Let me think about it.

413
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,800
Qin Shangcheng

414
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:38,590
So fat?

415
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,520
What's wrong if I'm fat?

416
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,560
Fat as I am, I can still practice swordplay!

417
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,000
I can still do kicking!

418
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,000
You bought it?

419
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,710
I bought it!

420
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:50,230
Not for you.

421
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,400
You don't eat it?

422
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,040
Don't eat it?

423
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,160
Don't eat it?

424
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,040
Here you are.

425
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:59,040
Wait for me.

426
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:03,310
Rong

427
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,280
What happened to you?

428
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,590
Hui!

429
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,950
I know you feel good in pregnancy.

430
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:08,950
But I'm different from you.

431
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:10,350
This method doesn't fit me.

432
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,560
Let me think of another way.

433
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:15,520
Rong

434
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:16,560
This time, we

435
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,400
should protect Wan Chi merchant ship to Mingzhou.

436
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:19,640
Dayou

437
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,280
Take good care of Her Highness.

438
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,190
Don't you worry about it, My Lord.

439
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:28,470
Your Highness

440
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:29,430
It seems to be very fun there.

441
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:31,350
Let's have a look.

442
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:32,190
You contemptible woman!

443
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:33,590
You contemptible woman!

444
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,400
I'll beat you to death!

445
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:36,950
Piss off!

446
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:37,760
It's none of your business!

447
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,470
If you dare say one more word,

448
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:39,430
I'll also beat you!

449
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,710
Stop!

450
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:44,760
How dare you beat others here?

451
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,560
How dare you disregard the law?

452
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,230
Yeah.

453
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:47,760
The law?

454
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,190
Look at this.

455
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:52,430
She has been sold to me!

456
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:53,950
And she let others free!

457
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:55,400
I won't break any law even if I beat her to death!

458
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:55,830
You...

459
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:57,000
If I hadn't let her go,

460
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,280
she would have been starved by you!

461
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,800
How dare you argue with me! I...

462
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,160
What are you doing?

463
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,190
Are you mad?

464
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,560
Let me tell you,

465
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,280
I, Qian Dayou, in my whole life,

466
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,950
resent those who are unreasonable!

467
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,560
This girl looks

468
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,280
pretty, decisive,

469
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,520
- and brave!
- Yes!

470
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,830
How dare you frame her?

471
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:13,400
Am I right?

472
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,070
Yeah!

473
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:14,520
Right.

474
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:15,710
Let me tell you!

475
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:17,310
It's my own business to teach her a lesson!

476
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:18,190
If you are going to teach me,

477
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,400
I’ll beat you up as well!

478
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,400
Beat him up, Qian Dayou!

479
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,280
How dare you!

480
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,800
How dare you fight against me, asshole?

481
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:24,760
Are you wrong or not?

482
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,560
I was wrong, I was wrong.

483
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:26,950
Give it to me!

484
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:33,430
Asshole, look at me.

485
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,560
I will take the contract from you today,

486
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,040
and give you some money so you suffer no loss.

487
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:37,760
Let me tell you!

488
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,070
If you dare to appear on the street, I'll...

489
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,230
No, no, no.

490
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:42,350
What a robust swordman! Bravo!

491
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,470
Bravo!

492
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:45,950
Thank you, guys!

493
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:46,800
Thank you!

494
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,190
Asshole! Only knows bullying the weak!

495
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:08,760
Goodbye.

496
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,310
Whom are you writing to?

497
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:11,190
Your Highness

498
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:12,190
In the morning, we just...

499
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,280
Qin Shangcheng

500
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,920
There are so many things I don't understand.

501
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,800
Could you please teach me?

502
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,640
Your Highness

503
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,710
Why are you here?

504
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,830
Do you have anything to hide from me?

505
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:26,640
No!

506
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,560
Mr. Hero

507
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:29,190
You...

508
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:29,680
You...

509
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,470
Why are you here?

510
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,280
I want to follow you.

511
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:34,000
Stop kidding me.

512
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,190
I'm not kidding.

513
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,760
I have nowhere to go.

514
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,640
My name is Zhu.

515
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,230
I'm very obedient.

516
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:39,400
I won't give you any trouble.

517
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:39,830
Well...

518
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:40,880
You can go anywhere you like.

519
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,880
Qian Dayou

520
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,640
She has already told you she has nowhere to go.

521
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:45,920
I'll discuss it with you later.

522
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:46,830
Your Highness

523
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,230
Your Highness

524
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:01,040
Can I...

525
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,000
go to the restroom?

526
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,000
Hold it back.

527
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:05,920
Rong

528
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:07,830
Rong

529
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:08,920
Rong

530
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,800
Look at the food I bought for you.

531
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:12,430
Look.

532
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,110
The girl is...

533
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:27,560
My Lord

534
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,640
The girl

535
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,190
was rescued by Her Highness and me

536
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,520
at the affair in the eastern town.

537
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:35,640
Excellent!

538
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,520
Rong always does such things!

539
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:39,680
Her name is Zhu.

540
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:40,520
Zhu

541
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,520
This is My Lord.

542
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,560
He is Qin Shangcheng.

543
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,760
Hello, Qin.

544
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:44,880
Hello, hello.

545
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,040
It's good that you stay here.

546
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,430
It seems that Rong today

547
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:50,430
has harvested a lot.

548
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,710
How about you?

549
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:55,350
Which reciprocal dinner did you have today?

550
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,520
No need to mention the reciprocal dinner!

551
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,310
What a coincidence!

552
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,760
After having the dinner,

553
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,280
I also went to the affair in the eastern town.

554
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,880
What a coincidence.

555
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:06,680
Well...

556
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,310
I went to the affair in the eastern town

557
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:09,560
and went into a porcelain shop.

558
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:12,110
I wanted to buy a pair of China Dolls

559
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,000
for Rong.

560
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:14,110
However,

561
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,710
they were sold out.

562
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,710
So I thought buying one is not good.

563
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:20,430
After thinking about it,

564
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:20,950
I just didn't buy it.

565
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,280
China Dolls?

566
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:26,710
You came there just for the China Dolls?

567
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:28,110
Precisely.

568
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:30,470
If I had known Rong also went there,

569
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:32,310
I would have looked for you there instantly.

570
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,590
I also asked Zhang Xian to hunt some wild animals.

571
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:35,230
At night,

572
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:36,520
we will have a good meal.

573
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,400
Let's have dinner together.

574
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:38,640
As for now,

575
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,830
Rong can eat some dessert.

576
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:40,350
Qian Dayou

577
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:40,920
Order food for us.

578
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:42,880
Qin Shangcheng

579
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,350
Your Highness

580
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:43,880
Let's order the meal.

581
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,520
Let's order the meal.

582
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,160
I...

583
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,400
Haven't I told you to guard Rong?

584
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:52,950
What's wrong with you?

585
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:53,590
Blimey, My Lord.

586
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:54,760
There are only two affairs in Mingzhou City.

587
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,680
Why did you just contact them

588
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,160
at the gate?

589
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:57,520
I...

590
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:01,640
My Lord

591
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,430
She, she, she...

592
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,000
Quick, quick, quick!

593
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,400
Mr. Wan

594
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,310
We met again.

595
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:12,950
Ms. Ye

596
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:13,920
Let's talk at another place.

597
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,350
Please.

598
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,230
Please.

599
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:25,310
Your Highness

600
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:28,230
The meal is not ready in the hotel.

601
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:29,590
My Lord buys the food in another place.

602
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:30,470
He'll come back soon.

603
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:33,160
We didn't say we were looking for Qin.

604
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:34,880
Yeah.

605
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:36,520
Weren't we talking about the dish?

606
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,070
Step aside!

607
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,110
I failed to intercept her, again.

608
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:00,590
Rong

609
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:02,430
I booked the whole restaurant today

610
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:04,400
so as to have dinner with you.

611
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,280
Zhu, let's eat.

612
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:12,830
You...

613
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:14,400
Why don't you eat?

614
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,520
We'll eat.

615
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,190
Come on. Eat something.

616
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:18,800
Rong

617
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:20,710
Try the Sweet and Sour Pork.

618
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,160
It's said to be a specialty of Mingzhou Prefecture.

619
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:24,590
Yes.

620
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:27,950
The woman I just saw

621
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:29,470
must be the proprietress of the porcelain shop.

622
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:35,040
Yes.

623
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,920
Why did she come for you?

624
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:38,280
She...

625
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:40,190
Didn't I just want to buy a pair of

626
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:41,920
China Dolls in her shop?

627
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,590
She came specially to tell me that

628
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,470
they are available now!

629
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:48,520
- What a coincidence!
- Right.

630
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:50,000
How shrewd she is!

631
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,040
How shrewd she is!

632
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:52,760
Why haven't I met

633
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,400
such a passionate proprietress?

634
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,110
Just have your dinner.

635
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:55,830
Stop talking.

636
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:01,230
I think she didn't ask you to claim goods,

637
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,800
but to claim the person!

638
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:05,430
I, Qin Shangcheng, swear to God,

639
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:07,280
that I will only marry Rong.

640
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,710
In my eyes, other women are merely

641
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:09,830
vulgar!

642
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:10,590
Right!

643
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,070
What a coincidence!

644
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:14,000
It's also said by dad when he married a concubine!

645
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,680
Eat this.

646
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,070
If you are really honest,

647
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,760
why did you meet her stealthily

648
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,040
and ask Qian Dayou to cover it for you?

649
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,800
Not at all!

650
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,230
There is no such a thing!

651
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:31,040
There's only business between me and her!

652
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,560
I have no affection for her at all!

653
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,590
If you don't believe me, ask Zhang Xian.

654
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,110
Miss Hua, I swear that

655
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:36,280
only that woman touched My Lord,

656
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,230
but My Lord has never touched her!

657
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:39,760
She even touched you!

658
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,470
Zhang Xian, tell me!

659
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:41,590
Where did she touch?

660
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:43,950
I have a headache.

661
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:44,800
I'll go to the restroom.

662
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,560
Go to the restroom.

663
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,280
You...

664
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,040
Zhang Xian!

665
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,880
Mr. Hero's friend is also extraordinary.

666
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,680
He went to the restroom with food in hand.

667
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,880
I cannot eat anymore.

668
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,710
I'm full.

669
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:01,470
I'll go back to my room.

670
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:02,920
Rong

671
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:07,920
Why don't they eat?

672
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,000
It's all yours.

673
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,280
Get out! Get out!

674
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,160
Rong, let me explain it to you.

675
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:12,710
The truth is...

676
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:14,110
Don't explain it to me!

677
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:15,070
Explain it to me until

678
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,160
you have made a perfect lie!

679
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:17,680
Rong

680
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,190
Go away!

681
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,040
Qin Shangcheng

682
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,070
You bastard!

683
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:25,190
It's already detestable to hide something from me.

684
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:26,520
How dare you be touched by others?

685
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,110
I will never speak to you anymore.

686
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:33,040
Rong...Rong?

687
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,640
Sorry, Rong.

688
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,470
I don't want to lie to you.

689
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,640
But the task this time is too dangerous.

690
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I must assure your safety first.

691
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,190
Mr. Wan

692
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:46,880
Don't be afraid.

693
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:49,520
As long as you follow my order to carry

694
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,280
goods from Mingzhou to South Desolation,

695
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,190
I won't treat you badly

696
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,950
if things go well.

697
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,160
You...

698
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:56,950
Who on earth are you?

699
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,430
Your excellency!

700
00:27:58,430 --> 00:27:59,000
Bad news!

701
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,470
The pirate ship caught up with us!

702
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:23,110
Don't move!

703
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,040
Tell us.

704
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,680
Who on earth are you?

705
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:28,000
Since you insist in sticking your nose in it,

706
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:29,590
just go to hell!

707
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:42,950
My Lord

708
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,640
There are marks of wolf's head on them!

709
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,070
Xuanling of South Desolation.

710
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,070
Isn't General Hua

711
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:56,830
fighting against them?

712
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:57,310
Yeah.

713
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:59,560
Distinguished General Hua,

714
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,310
Since a merchant ship on the sea found that

715
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:03,230
trace of spies from Xuanling of South Desolation

716
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:05,070
might be related to Mingzhou,

717
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,310
I am concerned that their secret actions

718
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,560
may affect the battle in the front.

719
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,520
Hereby notify the above.

720
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,190
Goodbye.

721
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,190
General Hua wrote us back.

722
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:17,000
Father-in-law has reported it to the Emperor.

723
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:19,710
The ship hijacked by them is from Mingzhou,

724
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:21,430
so Mr. Wei of Mingzhou Prefecture is accredited

725
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:22,230
to take charge of the matter.

726
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,560
Great!

727
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,040
My Lord

728
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,520
What should we do?

729
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,350
Two things.

730
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:27,160
One,

731
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,190
protect the merchant ship to Mingzhou City.

732
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:30,040
Two,

733
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:31,400
we should participate in

734
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,880
the inspection of spies of South Desolation.

735
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,680
Island Lord Qin, you say that

736
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,400
spies of South Desolation hijacked the ship

737
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,560
in order to smuggle goods in Tianchu

738
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:40,520
as merchants, right?

739
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,830
Before I came to Mingzhou,

740
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:45,560
I asked my brethren to search shops in Mingzhou.

741
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,280
There is a porcelain shop

742
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,280
which is super suspicious.

743
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:49,920
Its shipment

744
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,710
is far higher than the normal value.

745
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:53,430
And the specifications of merchant ships

746
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:54,310
are in a mess.

747
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,230
It sold all kinds of merchandises at first.

748
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:11,430
Where are you from?

749
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:24,190
From the south ten thousand miles away?

750
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,310
From the south ten thousand miles away.

751
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,640
So, what

752
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,310
do you want to buy?

753
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,350
Lingmei white porcelain cup.

754
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:42,430
My lord.

755
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,710
What you want

756
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:45,000
is not an ordinary cup.

757
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:47,000
You should really talk to me, Ms. Ye,

758
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,830
in detail.

759
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,640
I want to know

760
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,950
what your trade name is,

761
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,190
how big the ship is,

762
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,470
where the ship berths,

763
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,800
and how huge the scale is.

764
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,640
The trade name is Wan Chi.

765
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,560
People,

766
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,230
ship,

767
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:16,760
location,

768
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,110
and other information are all here.

769
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,070
Good.

770
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,520
When I finish calculating the shipment,

771
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,830
I'll send it to you

772
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:28,350
by myself.

773
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,470
The head is urging us.

774
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:33,920
People detained don't behave well.

775
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:35,640
An early shipment is required

776
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,190
for an early clearance.

777
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:39,000
Okay, okay.

778
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:41,920
You look so handsome,

779
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,400
and of course you're right.

780
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,950
I naturally dare not neglect your demands.

781
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:46,920
Come on.

782
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,680
Enjoy your tea.

783
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,190
Ms. Ye looked for me so anxiously,

784
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:53,070
so I think the deal is made.

785
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:55,000
It's so easy to talk to

786
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,950
a wise man.

787
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:04,680
At the next midnight,

788
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,920
meet at the pier in the southern town.

789
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:10,190
Rong

790
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:13,280
Wait for me.

791
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:45,800
Bitch!

792
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:48,470
Don't be cheated by the good look.

793
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:49,920
I know.

794
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,310
Enjoy your meal.

795
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:08,190
Wait for me to come back.

796
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,280
Qin Shangcheng

797
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:12,230
Rong

798
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:12,950
Rong

799
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,520
I've come to bring you some water.

800
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:15,710
Thank you, Zhu.

801
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,710
What an abundant breakfast!

802
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,310
Come on.

803
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:19,880
Let's sit and talk.

804
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:22,590
Do you think

805
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:24,760
he likes me

806
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,430
since he is so considerate?

807
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:27,280
Of course.

808
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:29,640
No matter how I like Dayou,

809
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,280
I won't be as thoughtful as him.

810
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,110
So...

811
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:33,880
if he is so thoughtful,

812
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,000
why does he blow hot and cold for me?

813
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,470
What on earth is he hiding from me?

814
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,680
I don't know, either.

815
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:42,830
However,

816
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:44,590
if someone really likes you,

817
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,040
even though he lies to you,

818
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,110
it's for your own good.

819
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:51,110
For my own good?

820
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:12,159
♪How strong the wind should be♪

821
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:18,880
♪to blow away the unsolved worry♪

822
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:26,610
♪Looking at the moon at the end of the world♪

823
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,770
♪The love comes from distant mountains and seas♪

824
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,800
Once my two-finger Zen is out of sheath,

825
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,320
there's no way to regret.

826
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,230
My nickname, the repeated loser,

827
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,840
does not have unearned reputation.

828
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:55,320
Please.

829
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:55,870
Please.

830
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,520
Let me seize the initiative.

831
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,040
One chess determines the end.

832
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:02,630
A single chess defends one.

833
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:05,080
I'll block.

834
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,190
I'll close.

835
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,870
I'll defend against it.

836
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,320
Work along both lines!

837
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:18,600
Mine is called working along both lines!

838
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,230
You lose!

839
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:20,840
You lose!

840
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:23,600
My dear Qian,

841
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:24,710
your chess skill recently

842
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:26,120
is getting better and better!

843
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:27,040
Tell me about it!

844
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:28,430
Every day, we are here

845
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:30,080
to prepare for the wedding house for our Lord,

846
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,280
inspect, and play chess.

847
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,320
Of course I'm getting more skilled.

848
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,040
You're right.

849
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:35,360
But it's okay.

850
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,560
Her Highness is busy in training the women army.

851
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,670
She has no time thinking about our Lord.

852
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:39,430
That's true.

853
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:41,600
But our Lord has been so busy in

854
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,040
preparing for the wedding house

855
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:44,470
that he evidently becomes slim!

856
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,520
Do you think we should help him?

857
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:49,910
You're acting like an amateur now.

858
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:52,190
Our Lord has been so attentive that

859
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:53,040
his attentiveness has

860
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,710
penetrated into each detail of the house.

861
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:55,840
So just don't rock the boat.

862
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,320
Okay?

863
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:58,190
Right.

864
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,600
But,

865
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,520
according to the design drawing,

866
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,470
Our Lord will see the completion today.

867
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,000
And our task will be completed!

868
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,280
What task will be completed?

869
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:09,840
What are you doing?

870
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,390
Your Highness

871
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,430
Nothing.

872
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:12,910
Zhang Xian and I were playing Gobang.
[*A traditional game in which the lining up of
five pieces in a straight line scores victory]

873
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:13,840
Why are you here?

874
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,390
I'm looking for Qin Shangcheng.

875
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:16,040
Where is he?

876
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,000
Why is he disappeared again?

877
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:17,910
Your Highness

878
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,230
My Lord is...

879
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:22,360
Your Highness

880
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,320
I will be candid with you.

881
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,150
He wants to cook fish soup for you,

882
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,230
so he go to the sea to catch the bass.

883
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:28,520
I don't believe you.

884
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,430
Zhang Xian, you tell me.

885
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,280
He's right.

886
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:33,710
Okay.

887
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:34,840
It's okay, Your Highness.

888
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,150
If you have anything to ask for help from us,

889
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:37,150
just tell us.

890
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:40,520
It happens that I have something to ask you two.

891
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,390
My women army has been training recently.

892
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:44,430
There are not enough people to practice with

893
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:45,760
so as to gain practical experience.

894
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,040
I think you two are good options.

895
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,560
Don't you want to do it?

896
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,120
Yes, we do!

897
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:53,950
Of course! Of course!

898
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:54,390
We do.

899
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:55,150
Let's go!
