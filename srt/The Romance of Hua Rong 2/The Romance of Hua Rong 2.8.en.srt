3
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,550
Rong,

4
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:51,080
why you look so worried?

5
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,039
Are you still worrying about those female slaves?

6
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:54,680
Rong, you don't have to worry.

7
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:57,440
The princess

8
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,000
has settled them.

9
00:01:59,229 --> 00:01:59,950
Well done,

10
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:00,590
Qian.

11
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,270
When did Qian Dayou become a eunuch?

12
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:05,910
My Lord,

13
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:06,870
I have

14
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,550
sacrificed myself

15
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:09,910
to solve problems for you.

16
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,670
The princess took out her own purse

17
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:13,800
to prepare money

18
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,670
for the women,

19
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:15,520
and prepared a carriage

20
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,670
to send them home.

21
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,079
Princess

22
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:19,440
is really beautiful and kind.

23
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:22,630
These are all trifles.

24
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:23,600
I'm not

25
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,880
an ordinary princess.

26
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:27,270
Swordman Yunhe saved the people

27
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,720
from fire and water.

28
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:30,960
As a follower of Swordman Yunhe,

29
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,880
of course I have to do my bit.

30
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,630
Qin Shangcheng,

31
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,750
where have you just been?

32
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:37,880
Your Highness,

33
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,600
it goes like this.

34
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,360
Just now, my Lord and I

35
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,000
searched under the cliff for a long time,

36
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,160
but

37
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,000
we still didn't find Shangguan Hong's body.

38
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,079
I reckon

39
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:47,320
he probably ran away.

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,030
Shangguan Hong

41
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,800
doesn't know Rong at all,

42
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:53,600
but he often gives tit for tat.

43
00:02:53,829 --> 00:02:55,550
There must be someone behind him.

44
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,520
Princess is really eagle-eyed.

45
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,079
Yes.

46
00:02:58,079 --> 00:02:59,240
To protect Your Highness,

47
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,520
we need to arrest Shangguan Hong quickly

48
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,670
and find out the mastermind.

49
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,670
Don't worry, Rong.

50
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,630
Qin and I will definitely protect you.

51
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,550
Shangguan Hong

52
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:07,800
must not dare to make troubles.

53
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,910
You really know how to seek credit.

54
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,910
The princess protects Rong

55
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:12,960
and rescues the female slaves.

56
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:14,080
Have some soup

57
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,030
and eat some fish.

58
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:17,720
Ling.

59
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,160
Hello, everyone.

60
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,110
Heir really doesn't take himself as an outsider.

61
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,670
What are you talking about?

62
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,880
Our heir is about to marry Hua Rong.

63
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,000
Qin is an outsider,

64
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,720
isn't he?

65
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,030
He even doesn't know how to use the Rapier.

66
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,550
He doesn't deserve

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,720
our Rong at all.

68
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,390
Looking for trouble?

69
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,880
Since this Rapier is a dowry,

70
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,270
heir has every right to become its owner.

71
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:56,320
But I don't know why you're so impatient.

72
00:03:56,829 --> 00:03:58,800
What's the secret behind this?

73
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,880
I'm very curious about it.

74
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,910
Since it will be mine sooner or later,

75
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,670
I want to

76
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,110
get it now.

77
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,240
You can have a try.

78
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,110
I really want to try it.

79
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,790
Heir,

80
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:26,920
the way I see it,

81
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,830
you'd better not try.

82
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:28,880
Because your martial arts

83
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,480
may be really inferior to my nephew.

84
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:31,350
Come on.

85
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:32,159
Eat something.

86
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:35,000
Come on.

87
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:57,110
You and Her Highness acted with one heart today,

88
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:57,880
which is formidable.

89
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,070
You directly frustrated heir's spirit.

90
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,270
It's really gratifying.

91
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:00,880
Isn't that right, Zhang?

92
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,640
Isn't this the picture of you and Her Highness?

93
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,040
Now the painters

94
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,550
can paint people as they get old.

95
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:08,350
But

96
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,040
why is my Lord

97
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,950
looking at the picture upside down?

98
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:10,830
What's the point?

99
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,040
My Lord,

100
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:24,720
are your eyes

101
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,350
all right?

102
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:29,230
I was injured by Shangguan Hong's hand cannon last night.

103
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,480
My Lord,

104
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,550
can you see me?

105
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:37,640
I'm Zhang Xian.

106
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,159
My Lord,

107
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,110
My Lord,

108
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,000
it won't matter.

109
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,000
I, Dayou,

110
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,390
will be your eyes in the future.

111
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,600
It'll be alright.

112
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,720
I'm not blind yet.

113
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,230
Precisely.

114
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:54,760
My Lord was just squinted by saltpetre.

115
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,070
He's not blind.

116
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,040
It's just not clear.

117
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,440
Have you forgotten Jiuyan of the Wanshang Conference?

118
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,230
He was squinted by saltpetre at that time.

119
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,160
And then

120
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,480
he was blind.

121
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,640
My Lord, do you remember?

122
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,000
My Lord,

123
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,160
I'm going to find the best doctor in Hai City now.

124
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,440
Qian Dayou,

125
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,270
go to find a man named Hua Geng.

126
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,670
My foster father mentioned him before.

127
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:24,760
His medical skills are superb.

128
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,920
He will cure my eyes.

129
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,640
Don't worry, my Lord.

130
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,830
I'll try my best to find him.

131
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,230
Go.

132
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,440
I can't let Rong worry.

133
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,270
The way Rong is holding a sword

134
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,070
is so charming.

135
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,790
Qin Shangcheng must have suffered from eye diseases.

136
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:58,320
Was he hurt by a hand cannon last night

137
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:59,830
while helping me out?

138
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:04,640
No.

139
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,110
I have to...

140
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,590
He didn't tell me because

141
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,790
he was afraid that I would be worried.

142
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,070
If I rushed to expose him,

143
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,350
wouldn't it make him sadder?

144
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:18,790
It is better to find out the truth first.

145
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,510
My Lord,

146
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,040
look!

147
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,200
This market is so lively.

148
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,000
There are so many people.

149
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,110
My Lord can still see.

150
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:30,200
It doesn't matter.

151
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,160
It's just ahead.

152
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:31,720
Here we are.

153
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,480
Let's go.

154
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:36,790
Come follow me

155
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:37,510
My Lord

156
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,110
Here we are.

157
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:39,440
You see.

158
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,000
Look.

159
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:41,920
Qian,

160
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,230
shouldn't we go to clinic?

161
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,440
Now we're here at a coffin shop.

162
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,390
My Lord is just blind.

163
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,000
You

164
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,670
come to the coffin shop.

165
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:51,670
What do you mean?

166
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:52,790
It is nothing to be surprised at.

167
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:53,760
My Lord,

168
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:54,830
I heard that

169
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:55,760
the miracle-working doctor Hua Geng

170
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,920
earns money from the living

171
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,000
and from the dead.

172
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,670
He heals the living

173
00:07:58,670 --> 00:07:59,600
and serves the dead.

174
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,760
But his whereabouts

175
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,320
are a bit

176
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,270
weird.

177
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:03,350
I got this.

178
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,790
Is the miracle-working doctor so mysterious?

179
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,270
My Lord.

180
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,549
My Lord,

181
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:45,590
is this miracle-working doctor reliable?

182
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:46,440
Look at the medicine.

183
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,150
It's covered with dust.

184
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,400
Long time no visitor I believe.

185
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,440
Nobody's here.

186
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:14,350
You don't look at the room?

187
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,590
Disturb my dream in broad daylight.

188
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:19,880
We meet again,

189
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,790
Hua Sanlang.

190
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,640
Could it be that you're not satisfied with my painting

191
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,150
and came here?

192
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,320
So you are the painter.

193
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,440
Then aren't you pretending to be blind?

194
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,280
I'm not pretending to be blind.

195
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,000
I used to be blind.

196
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,670
I just used a wonderful prescription to cure my eyes.

197
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,440
Is this

198
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,400
what you're here for?

199
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,080
Doctor,

200
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,230
don't keep us guessing.

201
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,110
Are there any good tricks?

202
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,710
There is no disease in this world

203
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:07,710
that I can't cure.

204
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:08,590
Yes. Yes.

205
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,030
It just

206
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:13,110
depends on your sincerity.

207
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,790
You are really sincere.

208
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:37,520
Of course.

209
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,350
Then

210
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:41,790
why did you get hurt?

211
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,200
He was squinted by saltpetre.

212
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:43,590
Yes.

213
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,550
Common doctors say that

214
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,080
if you were squinted by saltpetre,

215
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,320
there would be no cure.

216
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,760
It's just a matter of time to be blind.

217
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,200
Yes.

218
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,000
But I know one way.

219
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,840
I wonder

220
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,320
if you are willing to try.

221
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,080
Go ahead.

222
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,440
OK.

223
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,870
Use the snake gall of the golden eye snake king

224
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:10,960
as a supplement,

225
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:12,400
plus

226
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,760
a pair of fresh living human eyes.

227
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,880
An eye for an eye

228
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:19,960
to

229
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,760
recover your sight.

230
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,150
A pair of fresh living human eyes?

231
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,670
What kind of witchcraft is this?

232
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,760
Who believes it?

233
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,280
That's it.

234
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,590
Believe it or not,

235
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:28,910
I cured myself anyway.

236
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,590
My Lord.

237
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:32,790
My Lord.

238
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:33,790
Mr. Qin,

239
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:35,350
this method

240
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:37,640
only works for ten days after the injury.

241
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,150
If you don't change your eyes for ten days,

242
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,030
I can't help you.

243
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,080
Shut up

244
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:44,440
My Lord!

245
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:52,710
Never let Rong

246
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:54,150
know about it.

247
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,760
Get it.

248
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:57,110
But my Lord,

249
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,640
your eyes?

250
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,080
Are we really not

251
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:00,080
going to try?

252
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,550
Even if I'm blind,

253
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,080
I would never borrow someone else's eyes

254
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,400
for my own.

255
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,150
Don't mention this again.

256
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,590
Have you found Shangguan Hong?

257
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:12,110
We are checking the brothels, casinos and stages.

258
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,280
I believe we can catch

259
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,080
Shangguan Hong soon.

260
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,960
My Lord, don't worry.

261
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:20,400
Let's go. Let's go.

262
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,710
Now, tell me

263
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:35,320
where to find the golden eye snake king.

264
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:37,880
You two

265
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,400
have a tacit understanding of each other.

266
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,880
Such beautiful eyes

267
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,400
must be very suitable

268
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,200
if they are placed on Qin's face.

269
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,440
Isn't there only a ten-day deadline?

270
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:48,350
Cut the crap.

271
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,840
OK.

272
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,550
Actually,

273
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:51,640
the golden eye snake king

274
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,640
lives in Meiyin Valley on the outskirts of Hai City.

275
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,550
This is my special snake powder.

276
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,590
I'll give it to you

277
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:03,790
for free.

278
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:05,590
But girl,

279
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,440
I kindly remind you that

280
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,550
this snake king is hard to find,

281
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:10,640
and

282
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,710
there's only one.

283
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:28,640
Rong,

284
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,440
Rong,

285
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,550
one of the female slaves fainted.

286
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,710
Duanmu Bai is treating her.

287
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:32,080
Go.

288
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:32,590
Have a look.

289
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,110
How long have you been poisoned?

290
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,080
For less than a month.

291
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,350
Duanmu,

292
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,960
can I get rid of

293
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:18,640
this poison?

294
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,000
No,

295
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:21,710
wait a minute.

296
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,590
I'll write a special prescription for you.

297
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,000
Decoct the medicine on time

298
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:26,350
and you'll recover

299
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,470
in less than ten days.

300
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,320
Thank you.

301
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,440
Help her back.

302
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,760
What were they poisoned with?

303
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,280
Powder taken cold.

304
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:50,960
What is powder taken cold?

305
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,150
Powder taken cold can only make you feel cheerful

306
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,640
when you take it at first.

307
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,230
If you take it for a long time,

308
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,350
you will be addicted,

309
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,790
absent-minded,

310
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:59,000
and your body

311
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,840
will be hot and dry.

312
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,000
Shangguan Hong must have added this poison

313
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,520
to their drinking water.

314
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,000
And they can be addicted

315
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,440
and manipulated,

316
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,280
and even become his string puppets.

317
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,280
Is there any way to get rid of this poison?

318
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,840
Thanks to your help,

319
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,150
these female slaves

320
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:15,440
are not deeply poisoned.

321
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,230
It can be detoxified

322
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,840
by grinding smilax glabra, desmodium and licorice.

323
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,350
I'll write another prescription.

324
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,670
Decoct the medicine on time,

325
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,230
and they'll be fine.

326
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,960
- Goodbye.
- Thank you, Hua Rong.

327
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:33,150
You are welcome.

328
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,280
Get on the carriage.

329
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:35,710
Here you go.

330
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,000
Take care.

331
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,670
- Be careful.
- OK.

332
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,440
I hope they can have a better future.

333
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:52,110
Let's go.

334
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,080
Why didn't you go home with them?

335
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:04,550
I see.

336
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:05,760
Don't you have enough money?

337
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,350
No problem.

338
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:07,320
If you have difficulties,

339
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,280
you can tell me.

340
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,400
You can tell my sister.

341
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,080
She has a lot of money.

342
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,030
Yeah.

343
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:16,590
I remember you.

344
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:17,590
What is your name?

345
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,550
My name is Xiaoyue.

346
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,110
Why didn't you go back with them?

347
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,840
I was born in Hai City.

348
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,760
But I have no parents and sisters.

349
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,710
I've been homeless for a long time.

350
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:30,880
Xiaoyue,

351
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,640
if you would like,

352
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,550
you can follow me in the future.

353
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,320
I promise no one will hurt you again.

354
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,470
Say yes!

355
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:45,440
Then we will be good sisters in the future.

356
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,000
Let's go.

357
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,400
I'll take you to your room to change clothes.

358
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:56,320
Death Couple.

359
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,470
They're still alive.

360
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:08,880
My Lord,

361
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,280
the female slaves have been cured.

362
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,160
Why are you still frowning?

363
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,190
When I feel their pulse during the day,

364
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,520
I find that the pulse of Xiaoyue

365
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:20,880
is different from others.

366
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:22,160
Her pulse is rapid

367
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,280
and irregular.

368
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,160
Is it because Xiaoyue's physique is weak,

369
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,760
her situation is worse?

370
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:31,400
The biggest possibility is that

371
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,040
she has been poisoned for more than a month.

372
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,710
Less than a month.

373
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:37,880
She lied.

374
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,590
What's she up to?

375
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,590
But girl,

376
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:07,430
I kindly remind you that

377
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,760
this snake king is hard to find,

378
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:10,950
and

379
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:12,950
this is the only one.

380
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:17,430
How can I find the snake king?

381
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,560
Miss.

382
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,310
Xiaoyue,

383
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,310
Why haven't you slept yet?

384
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,800
This is the medicine

385
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,800
you asked me to get from Mr. Hua today.

386
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,230
I've decocted it for you.

387
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,110
Miss,

388
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,000
drink it while it's hot.

389
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,350
Look at you.

390
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,880
I know you are weak

391
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,070
and need more tonic.

392
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,350
It's for you.

393
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:55,070
Why did you send it to me?

394
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,190
Thank you, Miss.

395
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:03,830
Are you alright?

396
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:05,710
Excuse me, Miss.

397
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:06,160
I...

398
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,070
Don't pick it up.

399
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,230
Are you alright?

400
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:09,590
I'm fine, Miss.

401
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,830
I'm sorry.

402
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:11,520
I'll get

403
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,710
another bowl later.

404
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,880
I won't let you down.

405
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,680
Don't talk nonsense.

406
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,640
Xiaoyue,

407
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:21,430
according to the customs of Hai City,

408
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:22,680
only twin sisters

409
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,430
can wear such a red rope.

410
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,640
I do have a twin sister.

411
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,560
But she's already...

412
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,350
It's okay, Xiaoyue.

413
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,920
Although you lost a younger sister,

414
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,470
you have an elder sister.

415
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:39,880
Don't call me Miss anymore.

416
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,040
Just call me sister.

417
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:41,830
Really?

418
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,230
Sister Rong.

419
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,350
Come on, get up.

420
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:47,590
Slow down.

421
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,470
Leave it alone.

422
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:49,760
Well,

423
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,760
Xiaoyue,

424
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,110
you are from Hai City.

425
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,470
Do you know Meiyin Valley?

426
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:55,040
Rong,

427
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,560
what are you going to do in Meiyin Valley?

428
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,590
I have something important to do.

429
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,680
As for what I'm going to do,

430
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,760
you'll find out soon.

431
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:03,350
OK.

432
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,350
Why is Rong going to the Meiyin Valley?

433
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:17,590
Chief Shangguan.

434
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,310
How's it going?

435
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,520
I didn't make it.

436
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:25,560
Hua Rong is cautious.

437
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:27,070
I really didn't find

438
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,350
the opportunity to do it.

439
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:28,880
You're good for nothing.

440
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,830
I've many opportunities to kill your sister.

441
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,830
But I'm not gonna kill her.

442
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,920
I'm going to torture her slowly.

443
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,880
She can neither live nor die.

444
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,520
Chief Shangguan,

445
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,230
please

446
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:42,430
give me another chance.

447
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:43,310
Tomorrow,

448
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,590
Hua Rong will go to Meiyin Valley to catch the snake king.

449
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:46,160
At that time,

450
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,280
there are only two of us.

451
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,160
I won't hesitate any more.

452
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,070
That is a good opportunity.

453
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:47,830
Rong,

454
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,640
I've seen you countless times.

455
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,070
With my eyes closed,

456
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:56,070
I can imagine your smile.

457
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:02,280
But

458
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,880
I want to see you more.

459
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,230
Because I'm really afraid that

460
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,520
I can only imagine your face

461
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:22,230
in the future.

462
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,640
Qin Shangcheng,

463
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:30,280
whatever it takes,

464
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:32,310
I'll cure your eyes

465
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,760
and let you see me again.

466
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,000
My Lord,

467
00:24:59,400 --> 00:24:59,800
my Lord,

468
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,430
Qian Dayou

469
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:02,520
finds you

470
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,680
a folk prescription for your sight.

471
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,310
How is it?

472
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,230
Shall we have a try?

473
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:07,110
It smells good.

474
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,160
Not bad.

475
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,880
Oh my Lord, you're so cool.

476
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,710
Although you can't see,

477
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:15,400
you can still

478
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,110
do it with skill and ease,

479
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:16,880
as handsome as before.

480
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:19,590
Clean it up.

481
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:20,040
All right.

482
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:29,950
My Lord,

483
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,070
it seems poisonous.

484
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:39,000
Arsenic.

485
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,280
My Lord,

486
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,680
yesterday

487
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,040
Xiaoyue

488
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,230
seems to be decocting medicine

489
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:48,280
for Her Highness in the imperial kitchen.

490
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,800
She shouldn't do that, will she?

491
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:50,950
My Lord,

492
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:51,560
my Lord,

493
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,400
here is the eel.

494
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,350
Is Rong in the room?

495
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,710
I seem to

496
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:55,950
have heard from the guy on duty that

497
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,110
she went out with Xiaoyue

498
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:58,110
early in the morning.

499
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,350
My Lord,

500
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:05,230
this is the word "Hua" on the medicine bag.

501
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,590
Her Highness must have met Hua Sanlang.

502
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:08,520
They may have gone to Meiyin Valley to catch the snake now.

503
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:23,400
Why doesn't this snake powder work?

504
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,710
Why isn't there a snake here?

505
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:04,190
Rong,

506
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,040
don't do that.

507
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,640
I've sucked some of the venom out of your body,

508
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:17,190
but there's still residue.

509
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,760
Try not to move,

510
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,280
or it will spread faster.

511
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:21,470
Come on,

512
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:21,950
grasp it.

513
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:23,350
I'll find a doctor for you.

514
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:23,950
Don't worry.

515
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,160
Rong,

516
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:26,520
I...

517
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:27,230
Don't be afraid.

518
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,070
I'll be back soon.

519
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,230
I...

520
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,590
Be careful.

521
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:38,310
Xiaoyue,

522
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,280
watch out.

523
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:40,680
Be careful.

524
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,680
Shangguan Hong!

525
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:45,190
Hua Rong,

526
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:47,310
even if this traitor saved you once,

527
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:49,310
you have to die today.

528
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:53,680
OK,

529
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,400
tell me before I die.

530
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,880
Who the hell is going to kill me?

531
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,160
Maybe

532
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,560
the King of Hell will tell you.

533
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:02,800
Shoot!

534
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,110
Don't think too much.

535
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,880
I saved you because I didn't want to owe you.

536
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:43,110
I returned this shot to you

537
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,520
for Qin Shangcheng.

538
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,400
Now you owe me again.

539
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:54,400
My Lord,

540
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:54,950
are you alright?

541
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:58,070
No.

542
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:01,400
I acted according to your plan.

543
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:09,430
My Lord,

544
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:10,310
they all

545
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:11,190
lay down.

546
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:12,830
Go.

547
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,310
My Lord,

548
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:25,920
these people were just knocked out.

549
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:27,760
My Lord,

550
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,680
for heaven's sake,

551
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,950
only Shangguan Hong died.

552
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:31,430
He was shot in the head.

553
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:32,830
This must be by Her Highness.

554
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:35,760
My Lord,

555
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:37,760
these people were just knocked out.

556
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,880
Where did Her Highness go?

557
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,110
Did she come to catch the snake?

558
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:40,830
My Lord,

559
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,190
there is a letter on this man.

560
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:42,710
Take a look.

561
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,800
My Lord can't see.

562
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,800
Oh, yes.

563
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,350
If you want to save Hua Rong,

564
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:49,920
come to Meiyin Cave three miles away to accept a challenge.

565
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,230
Shangguan Hong is dead.

566
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:53,040
Who left the letter?

567
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:54,880
Duanmu Bai.

568
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:57,680
Duanmu Bai?

569
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:07,070
No, my Lord.

570
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:08,040
Her Highness is in the east,

571
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:08,800
while Meiyin Cave is in the west.

572
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,800
They're not together.

573
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,680
You two go help Rong.

574
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:13,800
I'll meet Duanmu Bai.

575
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:14,430
But...

576
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:17,110
OK, my Lord.

577
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:17,880
OK, my Lord.

578
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,430
Let's go.

579
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,070
Go.

580
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:32,350
The terrain here is complex,

581
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:33,920
and I hear echoes.

582
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:03,400
What on earth do you want to do?

583
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:05,640
Let's have a match.

584
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,070
If you win,

585
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:09,400
Hua Rong will go back safe and sound.

586
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,640
If I win,

587
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:12,430
hand over the Rapier.

588
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:13,830
Duanmu Bai,

589
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:16,070
You've noticed

590
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:17,680
something wrong with my eyes, haven't you?

591
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:19,800
But even if I can't see,

592
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,110
you have no chance of winning.

593
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,040
Meiyin Valley

594
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,470
is prepared for you.

595
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:27,710
Have a try, and you'll know.

596
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:29,560
In fact,

597
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,520
I have always regarded you as

598
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,830
a respectable opponent,

599
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,040
but now

600
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,920
you are not qualified to be my opponent.

601
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,160
I don't care

602
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:41,880
how you think.

603
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,160
The Rapier,

604
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:46,950
I am determined to win it.

605
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,040
It stops.

606
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:12,470
Stop here.

607
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:13,470
That direction,

608
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:13,880
go!

609
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:23,880
I...

610
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:27,590
Go.

611
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:12,880
I'm the imperial bodyguard of Prince Mu's Residence.

612
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:14,310
You're still trying to plot against me.

613
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,920
Look at him.

614
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,280
I'm also the best counselor of the pirate regiment.

615
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,160
Am I proud?

616
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,040
Am I proud?

617
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:31,400
Come on.

618
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,230
Am I proud?

619
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:33,280
That's enough.

620
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:34,710
Let's go

621
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:35,590
save Her Highness.

622
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:39,830
Give up

623
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:40,950
and hand over the Rapier,

624
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,280
or I'll kill you.

625
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:45,800
I, Qin Shangcheng, never give up!

626
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,920
It turns out that you just retreat

627
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,040
to locate the torch.

628
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,190
You can't get the Rapier.

629
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:02,350
You are now like a spent arrow,

630
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:03,880
so save your strength.

631
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,310
You want to fight,

632
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:06,520
let's fight.

633
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:48,280
Qin Shangcheng!

634
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:53,389
Little White Dove.

635
00:34:59,120 --> 00:34:59,840
Qin Shangcheng,

636
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:00,800
are you alright?

637
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:01,630
My Lord.

638
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:02,230
My Lord.

639
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:03,670
You're really invincible in the world.

640
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:04,230
Yeah!

641
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,120
My Lord,

642
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,320
Her Highness has found the snake king.

643
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,000
Your eyes

644
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:07,910
will be cured.

645
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:08,760
Yes.

646
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:11,910
-Qin Shangcheng!
-My Lord!

647
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,230
-Qin Shangcheng!
-My Lord!

648
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:14,280
My Lord, wake up.

649
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,470
Doctor Hua,

650
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,470
how is he?

651
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,040
He's fine.

652
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,320
Mr. Qin's coma

653
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,840
was caused by mental damage

654
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,190
and exhaustion of energy.

655
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:49,630
It's no big deal.

656
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:51,470
He needs to rest and recover.

657
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,670
Where is Duanmu Bai?

658
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:53,560
I'm going to find him right now

659
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,600
to revenge for Qin.

660
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,040
Princess,

661
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:02,710
rest assured.

662
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:04,800
We tied him up from top to toe.

663
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:05,390
So,

664
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:06,470
when our Lord's eyes

665
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:07,470
are cured,

666
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:08,800
let's go interrogate him together.

667
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:13,120
Doctor Hua,

668
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,190
the golden eye snake king is ready.

669
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:17,520
Let's start changing eyes for Qin Shangcheng.

670
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,120
Yes,

671
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,120
I'll get ready.

672
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:19,840
Thank you.

673
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,280
OK.

674
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:22,760
Thank you very much.

675
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:24,560
Your Highness,

676
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:26,390
my Lord said before

677
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:28,120
that he didn't want to change his eyes

678
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,080
with others.

679
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:30,190
Zhang,

680
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:32,670
my Lord thinks it's cruel

681
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:33,840
to gouge other's eyes.

682
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,120
But aren't there ready ones now?

683
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:36,740
The wicked people of the Qing Hong Gang

684
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:37,430
have done all evil deeds,

685
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:39,670
and their eyes are wasted on them.

686
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:40,840
Just make the most of them,

687
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:42,190
am I right, princess?

688
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:44,280
The eyes of those bad guys

689
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,670
are certainly not as good-looking as Qin's eyes.

690
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:47,360
But now

691
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,840
there is no other choice.

692
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,120
I'm going to find Qin a pair of eyes

693
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,470
that best match him.

694
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:54,080
Let's go.

695
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,190
Qin Shangcheng,

696
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:10,000
I can promise you anything else,

697
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:11,630
but I can't agree on this one.

698
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:14,360
I must cure your eyes.

699
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:29,520
Guys,

700
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:32,710
the first step

701
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:34,710
is to take out the eyes.

702
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:36,870
After I take them out,

703
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:39,040
they'll be supplemented with snake gall as guiding drug,

704
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:39,800
and finally

705
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,560
transplanted to Mr. Qin.

706
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:43,000
This treatment

707
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,190
will take about three hours.

708
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,320
Just leave one person here

709
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,470
to help me.

710
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,360
It's such an important moment for Qin,

711
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,000
so I, Chu Fengling, must stay here.

712
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:55,600
Ling,

713
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:56,840
think it over.

714
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,150
After gouging out the eyes,

715
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,280
there's gonna be blood everywhere.

716
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,800
Then,

717
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,840
let's give this heavy responsibility to Rong.

718
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,560
Let me know if Qin wakes up as soon as possible.

719
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:07,950
Qian Dayou and Zhang Xian,

720
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,150
guard at the door.

721
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:10,280
Don't let anyone in.

722
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,520
Come on.

723
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,560
Take the anaesthetic pill

724
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,280
I made for you,

725
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:29,520
and you won't feel anything.

726
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,190
Don't worry.

727
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:32,190
I promise it won't hurt at all.

728
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:37,840
Do you want to give your own eyes?

729
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:40,000
I don't think Qin Shangcheng

730
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,430
wants to hurt innocent people.

731
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,600
No regrets?

732
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:47,800
It's just a pair of eyes.

733
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,800
Even if it's my life,

734
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:51,710
I'm willing to do it.

735
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,190
Her Highness really has good taste.

736
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:56,040
Look at this portrait by master Hua of the Ming Dynasty.

737
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,800
Every painting is vivid.

738
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,150
Zhang,

739
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,520
this painting

740
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,000
is an upgraded version of the painting of the elderly,

741
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,360
the painting of children in the Ming Dynasty.

742
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,560
According to the appearance of you and Hui,

743
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,760
he can draw the appearance of your future child.

744
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,190
No one else can draw it at all.

745
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,230
Qian,

746
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,800
it just doesn't look right.

747
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:16,430
He's like you.

748
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:17,430
He's not like me.

749
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,520
What are you talking about, Zhang?

750
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:22,230
Is this portrait as handsome as me?

751
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:22,950
No.

752
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:23,910
Look at the eyes,

753
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:25,190
the nose, the eyebrows.

754
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:26,280
All different form me.

755
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:27,910
Wait, Zhang.

756
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:28,710
What do you mean?

757
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:30,080
Let me tell you.

758
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,190
I'm not interested in friend's wife.

759
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:33,360
Hui and I, we had no affairs.

760
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:34,950
I'm just saying.

761
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:36,000
Why are you so excited?

762
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,120
You must have evils in your mind.

763
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:40,710
That makes one of us.

764
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:41,280
I also want to ask

765
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,430
if you like our princess?

766
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,910
You look at this kid.

767
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:44,950
The eyebrows are so thick.

768
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:45,630
Do they look like mine?

769
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:47,230
-I like your princess?
-Look at my eyebrows.

770
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:48,560
If I had to choose between Hui and the princess,

771
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,430
I would choose Hui for sure.

772
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:50,190
What do you mean?

773
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:51,120
Do you think my princess

774
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:51,760
can't compare to Hui?

775
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,950
Of course!

776
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:53,630
You are so rude!

777
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:54,630
You want a battle?

778
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:55,080
Bring it on!

779
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,280
I know you're not afraid of me.

780
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,710
But Hui is afraid of me.

781
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:00,000
Hui is afraid of you?

782
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,840
Hui is afraid of you.

783
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,840
What are you going to do?
