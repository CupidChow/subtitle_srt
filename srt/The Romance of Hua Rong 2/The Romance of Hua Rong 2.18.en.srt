Who is it?

4
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,030
Kong Lin has mentioned that

5
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,520
the former alliance leader passed away
because of Qi deviation

6
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,270
when he was cultivating in seclusion.

7
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,630
It should be his remains.

8
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,390
My Lord.

9
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,360
He is the former alliance leader indeed.

10
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,520
So, he's Crab's grandfather, isn't he?

11
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,470
I'm supposed to call him grandfather.

12
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:46,829
Grandfather,

13
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,800

Her Highness will be curable.

17
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,000
Yeah!

18
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,270
But why did the last alliance leader

19
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:04,000
have the antidote of Love-breaking Hibiscus?

20
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:17,950
It's a testament left by the last alliance leader.

I'll go to the Alchemy House to detoxify Rong.

Wait for a moment.

74
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,280
How did the Imperial Lady die?

75
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,520
If Wu obeyed me,

76
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,440
She wouldn't have been dead.

77
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,710
Shameless bastard!

78
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,030
She hurt me first.

79
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,840
But my good boy,

80
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,760
you don't need to be sad for it.

81
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,280
The fact that you can't pull the Rapier off

82
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:42,760
has proved that

83
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,280
you are not her son at all.

84
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,440
Then why is Hua Rong?

85
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:51,760
Fine.

86
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,150
I'll tell the truth to you

87
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,670
before you die.

88
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,200
After Wu committed suicide,

89
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,590
I would have

90
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,320
killed her son to stamp out the root of trouble.

91
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,520
But Qin Yin got instructions

92
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,080
from Mu Qing before I took action.

93
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,880
He escaped with that bastard.

94
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,000
Unfortunately,

95
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,470
Before escaping from the Imperial Island,

96
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,670
he was caught up with by me.

97
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:13,550
To survive,

98
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,710
he left the kid behind.

99
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,640
Now I realize that

100
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,440
I really underestimated Qin Yin at that time.

101
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,880
To protect Mu Qing's son,

102
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,350
he even changed him

103
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:28,230
with his newly born son.

104
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,400
So,

105
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,080
you are Qin Yin's son.

106
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,710
Then you are foster brothers.

107
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,320
My good boy.

108
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:46,440
Actually,

109
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,840
you almost should have been killed by me.

110
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,520
It's Duanmu Qingcang

111
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,230
who rushed to the Imperial Island
with his men to save your life.

112
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,110
I had to lie to him that

113
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:00,280
Mu Qing died from dystocia

114
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,760
as the result of being sad

115
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:03,790
when she knew that the old wretch

116
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,110
died from Qi Deviation.

117
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:07,440
I have never thought that

118
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,880
her real kid

119
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,230
was a daughter.

120
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:21,960
Okay.

121
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,440
It's time to kill you.

122
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:27,320
Exactly.

123
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,760
However, it's not us who will be killed

124
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,550
but you.

125
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:38,590
Why?

126
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,960
How come you're not poisoned?

127
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,710
The drug is only ineffective to
the alliance leader's descendants.

128
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,000
Are

129
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:48,910
you...?

130
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,000
Oh, I see.

131
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,280
The Lord operated blood exchange
on Her Highness before.

132
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,150
So, she could pull out the Rapier.

133
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,000
That is to say,

134
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:03,110
My Lord is the real Imperial Son.

135
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:09,790
I have ever fought with you before.

136
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,440
Even if you are highly skilled in martial arts,

137
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,400
can you protect all the people here?

138
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,590
Today, as long as I'm here,

139
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,320
you definitely can't hurt

140
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,840
my friends and brothers.

141
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,030
Qin Shangcheng,

142
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,350
just give me a moment.

143
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,110
Hold on.

144
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,840
My Lord.

145
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:22,840
You go to save others.

146
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:23,670
I'm going to catch up with him.

147
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:24,910
Okay.

148
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,400
There's no way out for you.

149
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:53,110
Wait.

150
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,670
No one can save him.

151
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,760
He must be killed today.

152
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:01,710
Qin,

153
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,590
if you trust me,

154
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,400
can you leave me alone to talk with him?

155
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,320
Are what you said true?

156
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,110
Absolutely.

157
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,910
You are indeed not the real son of Duanmu Qingcang.

158
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:36,350
But you have been raised in Prince Mu's Residence
for over 20 years.

159
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:38,640
You shouldn't stand idly and watch me die.

160
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,550
My good boy.

161
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,670
Look.

162
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,790
This is Imperial Edict.

163
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,670
I can give it to you.

164
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,280
But

165
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,080
I hope you can

166
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,840
let me go for the sake of

167
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
our relationship as master and disciple.

168
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,840
I won't kill you.

169
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:34,110
Neither will I save you.

170
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:01,840
Qin,

171
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:06,440
take this,

172
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,200
and you can save all the people
of Prince Mu's Residence.

173
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:12,520
My surname is Qin.

174
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,320
Your surname is Duanmu.

175
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:14,760
That's your duty

176
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:15,760
instead of mine.

177
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,000
I'm Qin Shangcheng, King Pirate.

178
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:19,080
And you

179
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,000
are the heir of Prince Mu's Residence.

180
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:23,440
You can take it home to save your families.

181
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,760
But you have to promise that

182
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,960
you will do your best to stop
Duanmu Qingcang restarting the war.

183
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,470
I know that

184
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,150
you

185
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:36,030
don't want another war between the two countries
any more than I do.

186
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,150
All right.

187
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,000
I will make all efforts.

188
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,790
Where's Kong Lin?

189
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:59,200
If nothing unexpected happened,

190
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,030
he should have been burned to death.

191
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,150
Now, Old alliance leader and Imperial Lady

192
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,310
can rest in peace.

193
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:05,640
Right.

194
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,470
This matter finally came to a period.

195
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:07,640
Our journey to the Imperial Island this time

196
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,109
is a triple victory!

197
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,470
Triple victory?

198
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:11,160
Which victory?

199
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,109
You don't get it, do you?

200
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:12,680
Firstly,

201
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,310
My Lord finally got Her Highness back.

202
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,040
Secondly,

203
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,230
Her Highness finally became

204
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:18,349
the alliance leader of the Imperial Alliance, which was
once the number one sect in the martial arts world.

205
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:19,160
Thirdly,

206
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,109
My Lord finally got to know who his own parents are.

207
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:24,430
I used to think that My Lord were a man of noble birth.

208
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:25,560
But now, it seems that

209
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,190
he... Shut up!

210
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:28,310
Alright! Alright!

211
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,640
Let's hurry back to the Imperial Palace.

212
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,040
People of the Imperial Alliance

213
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,800
have the rights to know about everything.

214
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,310
Sister,

215
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:33,950
let's go together.

216
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:35,950
Where's Duanmu Bai?

217
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:36,950
Right!

218
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:37,640
Where is he?

219
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,590
He left just now.

220
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:46,800
Duanmu Bai,

221
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,800
you're going to leave alone

222
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,680
without saying goodbye to us, right?

223
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:56,640
I still have unfinished business.

224
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,160
So, I have to go.

225
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,830
What about me?

226
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:03,110
Look at me.

227
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:08,710
Duanmu Bai.

228
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:10,310
I like you.

229
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,280
No matter where you are,

230
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,110
you are stuck with me.

231
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,000
Although the sky is far away,

232
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,430
and lovers are north and south,

233
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,230
They will stay with each other forever

234
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,350
just like mandarin ducks.

235
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:24,880
I hate pedants like you.

236
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,800
Even the words of rejection sound so nice.

237
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,680
I have to explain to you.

238
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,520
The little fool

239
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,280
doesn't understand it.

240
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,310
Actually, it means that

241
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,280
no matter where the two lovers are,

242
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,430
as long as their heart are connected,

243
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:43,710
they will definitely see each other again.

244
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:46,950
Duanmu Bai,

245
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,310
come back peacefully.

246
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:49,430
I'm waiting for you.

247
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:10,280
Qin Shangcheng,

248
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,230
Duanmu Bai

249
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:12,590
actually is your younger brother.

250
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,710
What are you going to do about your relationship?

251
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,950
He needs time,

252
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:23,710
and so do I.

253
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,350
Okay.

254
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,160
I'm with you.

255
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:26,310
However,

256
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,920
there's a more important thing.

257
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,560
It's time to return the alliance leader's seat

258
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,000
of Imperial Alliance to you, the real imperial son.

259
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,430
Rong would rather destroy the Rapier

260
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:36,760
for the safety of all the people of the Imperial Alliance

261
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,230
at the risk of your own life.

262
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,830
And you have also learnt
the Shengxin Incantation in the secret room,

263
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,000
and seriously injured Kong Lin.

264
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,520
I'm pondering that

265
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,280
no one is more suitable than you

266
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,350
to be the alliance leader.

267
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:47,830
But the Imperial Alliance...

268
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:48,520
No buts.

269
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,400
All I want to do now is be

270
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,760
a man behind the alliance leader,

271
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:55,040
witnessing my Rong expanding the alliance.

272
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,230
Then I'm sure to live up to your expectations.

273
00:19:59,160 --> 00:19:59,680
Good girl!

274
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:17,830
Mother.

275
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:19,350
Grandfather.

276
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,400
I come to see you with Rong.

277
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:23,760
Mother.

278
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,070
Grandfather.

279
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,920
Thank you for saving my life.

280
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:29,640
Without you,

281
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:31,640
it's impossible for me to stand here.

282
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,350
I've been busy with the Imperial Alliance these days.

283
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,000
So, it's late for me to see you.

284
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,830
I hope you will forgive me.

285
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,400
Rong is the only

286
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,950
lover in my life.

287
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,520
Hope mother and grandfather

288
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,680
bless Rong

289
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:49,950
without illnesses and worries in her life.

290
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:54,310
And bless us

291
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,000
live together till old and grey,

292
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,760
never to be apart.

293
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,520
When I was sorting out my mother's belongings,

294
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:13,160
I realized

295
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,560
how difficult her life was.

296
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:23,590
When my mother was pregnant with me,

297
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,920
Duanmu Qingcang was heading out for battle,

298
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:28,920
leaving my mother alone on the Imperial Island.

299
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,680
If he had cared more about my mother back then,

300
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,190
maybe the things later on
wouldn't have happened at all.

301
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,880
He has failed in his duty as a husband,

302
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,710
not to mention being a father to me.

303
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,950
Qin Shangcheng.

304
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:48,400
You know,

305
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,190
my mother appeared in my dream last night,

306
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,950
and told me to live our life.

307
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:54,110
She also asked me

308
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:55,950
when she would have a grandchild.

309
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:58,710
Is it time to restart

310
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:00,350
our plan to have babies?

311
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:05,310
What do you think, Rong?

312
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,310
I'm all yours!

313
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:09,710
Wonderful!

314
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,430
Qian.

315
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:30,760
Recently, I have suffered from weakness in spirit,

316
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:31,880
loss of appetite,

317
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,920
insomnia at night,

318
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,000
and even hallucinations about Hui.

319
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,590
Am I sick?

320
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:38,640
Zhang.

321
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:39,950
We have

322
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:41,400
the same illness sympathized with each other.

323
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,040
We both got lovesickness.

324
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,000
Think about it.

325
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,470
My thoughts of the princess

326
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,190
are like these candied fruits.

327
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,950
A little sour

328
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:53,470
and a little sweet.

329
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,640
My thoughts of Hui

330
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:58,310
are like the Fetus Decoction.

331
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:00,190
It tastes bitter.

332
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:01,560
However,

333
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:03,000
an aftertaste that lingers.

334
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,190
Just be content.

335
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:06,040
Okay?

336
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,110
When everything is over,

337
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,760
you'll be able to go back and reunite with Hui.

338
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:10,560
I even don't know

339
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,760
when I'll see the princess again.

340
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,280
Zhang Xian.

341
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:19,110
My Lord.

342
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:19,680
Come on.

343
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,310
Tell him all about it!

344
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,160
What am I supposed to say?

345
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,470
Our Lord is giving you an opportunity to make contributions.

346
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:33,190
Tell My Lord everything

347
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:34,000
you know

348
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:34,880
about pregnancy!

349
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:36,950
Hui and I are also confused about how to be pregnant.

350
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:39,560
I really have nothing to speak, My Lord.

351
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,350
Idiot!

352
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,160
My Lord,

353
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:42,000
I have something to say.

354
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,190
What do you know about it?

355
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:45,310
My Lord,

356
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,310
as the saying goes,

357
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:47,590
if you figure out one aspect, you will know all of it.

358
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:48,760
After all, I am

359
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,920
a master of love.

360
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,920
The pregnancy is the same as the love.

361
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,920
The first step

362
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,680
is to make sure that

363
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,190
you will fight no battle unprepared.

364
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:00,880
Go on.

365
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,560
You and Her Highness spent more time
apart than you do together.

366
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,470
And you also experienced so many twists and turns of life.

367
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:08,000
This time, you must choose an auspicious day,

368
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,760
and a romantic place with excellent luck

369
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,590
to inspire Her Highness's maternal instinct.

370
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:13,760
When conditions are ripe, success is assured.

371
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,040
Sounds good!

372
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,000
Apparently so.

373
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:21,400
Is it that complicated?

374
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,920
Wow!

375
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,800
What day is it today?

376
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,230
Is there anything good?

377
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:42,470
Our new Minister cooked for me.

378
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:43,430
Absolutely, there's something good.

379
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,230
Meng.

380
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:47,000
Your Highness,

381
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:48,430
let me give you a report

382
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:50,430
about our recent work in Imperial Alliance.

383
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:53,280
Since you advocated to build a new

384
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,230
Imperial Alliance of fairness and justice for all,

385
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:57,310
we have reorganized our alliance.

386
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:58,710
And in accordance with the philosophy,

387
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,920
we have reenacted the rules of the Imperial Alliance.

388
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,110
And about the

389
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,710
Women's Army Incubation Program,

390
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,830
let My Lady tell you.

391
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:08,000
Sister.

392
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:09,070
Crab.

393
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:10,880
Women Imperial Disciples on the Imperial Island

394
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,230
and my women pirates' regiment

395
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:13,560
constitute the Women's Army.

396
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,760
They have started the training.

397
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:15,950
Together with

398
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:18,310
the women's army of Huarong Island
who are on their way to the Imperial Island,

399
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:20,160
our Women's Army is taking shape!

400
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:21,800
How can we not celebrate such a good thing?

401
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,000
You are right!

402
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,590
It's certainly worth celebrating!

403
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,950
With your help,

404
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:28,350
I feel relieved.

405
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:29,400
Alright.

406
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,680
We are sisters. Don't mention it.

407
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:31,560
Come on.

408
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,830
Try my signature dishes.

409
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,230
What's wrong?

410
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:47,190
Is it that bad?

411
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:52,000
It's not bad.

412
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:55,000
Meng.

413
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,760
Get the doctor!

414
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,190
Okay.

415
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:01,950
Hurry up!

416
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,230
Come on!

417
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:06,770
Your Highness, Minister.

418
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:08,660
I have invited the best doctor

419
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,110
in the Imperial Alliance.

420
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,160
It's you again?

421
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,470
Please don't alarmed, my two Highnesses.

422
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,680
I'm one of the four Protectors of the Imperial Alliance.

423
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,680
The Imperial Island Token can prove it.

424
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,880
More than twenty years ago,

425
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,680
I was known in Jianghu as Hua Wuque,

426
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:33,000
the Fairy Doctor.

427
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,040
When I was young,

428
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:37,310
I was also a stately and handsome man.

429
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,760
But sometimes I was short of discerning power

430
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,470
so that I was seduced by the Demon Sect's devil witch.

431
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:43,350
Enough.

432
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:45,680
We don't have time to listen to your cheesy love stories.

433
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,800
Come to take the pulse of Her Highness.

434
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,000
Alright!

435
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:09,950
Congratulations! Her Highness!

436
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,430
You are pregnant

437
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,560
for more than a month.

438
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,830
Crab, you are pregnant!

439
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,760
Congratulations! Her Highness!

440
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,640
Why are you still seated?

441
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,830
Go to get the medicine for Her Highness.

442
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:23,430
Wait for a second.

443
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,070
In the future, you must assist Her Highness

444
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:25,950
to restore the Imperial Alliance.

445
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:27,190
Don't swindle and bluff.

446
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,230
You're perfectly right.

447
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:30,230
Perfectly right!

448
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:30,760
Follow me.

449
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:33,470
Please.

450
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,280
Sister.

451
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:37,160
Qin Shangcheng

452
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,230
is clamoring for a baby with me every day.

453
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:40,710
I never thought it would come true so soon.

454
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:41,880
I'm going to tell the good news

455
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,640
to Qin Shangcheng right now.

456
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,280
Wait.

457
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,230
Not now.

458
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,680
Why?

459
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,430
In our pirate community, there is a rule that female pirates

460
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,800
who are pregnant for less than three months

461
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,070
must not tell the father.

462
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:52,830
Otherwise the kid will die.

463
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:55,110
Therefore, you must keep your mouth shut on this matter.

464
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,400
Better to be sure than sorry.

465
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,800
From now on,

466
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,000
I'm the foster mother of the kid.

467
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,920
You need to listen to me.

468
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:03,920
You mustn't tell Qin Shangcheng

469
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:05,950
about the news.

470
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,520
Alright.

471
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,830
I'll follow you.

472
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,040
Good.

473
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,710
Qin Shangcheng

474
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:26,710
asked me to be here,

475
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:27,710
while he isn't here. Why?

476
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:35,920
Daodao.

477
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:38,350
Daodao.

478
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,280
Daodao.

479
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:44,640
Daodao.

480
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,520
Where's Daodao?

481
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:53,430
I thought Daodao really came here.

482
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:54,520
You trick me again.

483
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:56,590
Daodao didn't come here.

484
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:57,950
But I have prepared

485
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,470
a surprise for you.

486
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:00,110
Really?

487
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,000
What?

488
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,640
They are so cute.

489
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,920
I know you will miss Daodao.

490
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,310
So, I ordered someone to make

491
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:14,190
Daodao's family specially for you.

492
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:16,040
This one

493
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,160
is Dao's mother.

494
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:18,470
This one

495
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:19,430
is Dao's father.

496
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:21,800
How could this be?

497
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,640
This one is so bulky.

498
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,950
It must be male.

499
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:24,800
He's father.

500
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,680
She 's mother.

501
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:26,350
Aren't they?

502
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,040
The reason why this one is more bulky

503
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,430
is because she is

504
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:33,070
pregnant.

505
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,520
Of course, the most important one is

506
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,590
baby Dao.

507
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:39,070
Dao's father.

508
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:40,800
Dao's mother.

509
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:44,190
Qin Shangcheng,

510
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:45,280
what if Daodao

511
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,950
really doesn't come back

512
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:48,280
to see us?

513
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:52,800
Well.

514
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:54,950
When he grows up,

515
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:56,190
he will definitely come back.

516
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:57,760
However,

517
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:58,560
Rong,

518
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:00,920
don't you want

519
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:02,160
have a

520
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,710
Daodao

521
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,040
of us?

522
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,400
What does that have to do with

523
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,350
you asking me to come here?

524
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,400
I'll take you to a place.

525
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,040
Come on.

526
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:35,160
Rong, do you know?

527
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,280
I know from my mother's letters that

528
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:38,950
this place

529
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,160
is where I was born.

530
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:48,160
Maybe when I was a baby,

531
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:49,590
I have ever made One-Year-Old Catch here,

532
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,110
stumbled here,

533
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,760
and been lulled to sleep by my mother.

534
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:58,190
Just like the days when we were at Mermaid Bay.

535
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,350
This is my Promised Land.

536
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:06,430
So, I want to

537
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:08,470
have a baby

538
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,230
of our own with you here.

539
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,590
Qin Shangcheng,

540
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:15,350
actually...

541
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:15,950
My Lord.

542
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:17,040
Your Highness.

543
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,640
My Lord. Your Highness.

544
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:20,430
We just received a message from General Hua.

545
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,350
South Desolation staged a coup.

546
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:22,520
Duanmu Qingcang

547
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,470
has ascended the throng.

548
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,560
Just as we expected.

549
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:31,070
Now,

550
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,950
we can only pin the hope on Duanmu Bai.

551
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:53,640
Remember what I told you today.

552
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:56,040
I will never leave here.

553
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,680
I don't want to go.

554
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,470
It's boring to live in the imperial palace.

555
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,560
I've lived here all my life.

556
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,950
I can't sleep anywhere else.

557
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:06,640
I won't leave.

558
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:07,920
Your Majesty,

559
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:08,950
according to the ancestral rules,

560
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:09,190
Grandma.

561
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:11,070
you should indeed live in the imperial palace.

562
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,000
Grandma, don't be angry.

563
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,880
I have an idea.

564
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,520
You go to live in the imperial palace,

565
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,800
and confer upon Prince Mu's Residence the palace

566
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,800
for a long-term temporary stay.

567
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,950
It's not against the ancestral rules, is it?

568
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:20,520
Right.

569
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,760
You are smart, Bai.

570
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,760
Do it now!

571
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:25,710
As you command.

572
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:28,280
Bai.

573
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:28,800
Grandma.

574
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,920
I haven't seen you for a long time.

575
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:32,520
Let me have a look at you.

576
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:33,920
You've lost weight.

577
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:35,800
You must have suffered a lot.

578
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,280
Not yet.

579
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,760
You are still thoughtful.

580
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:42,880
From now on, you should stay with me more often

581
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,520
to let me care about you.

582
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:46,830
Grandma,

583
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,800
as my father just ascended to the throng,

584
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,400
and is busy with affairs,

585
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,000
my time with you

586
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
is bound to be reduced.

587
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I beg your pardon.

588
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,880
I'm not unreasonable.

589
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:58,920
Afterwards,

590
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:02,350
just come back to see me more often.

591
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:14,160
Take care of yourself, Grandma.

592
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:15,830
I shall leave now.

593
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:20,040
Why did he behave

594
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:21,760
like we won't meet again?

595
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,310
Go and get prepared.

596
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,000
Yes, His Majesty.

597
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,000
Father, are you about to go out for a battle?

598
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,560
Bai,

599
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,470
It's good that you're here.

600
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,880
I would like to confer upon you the title of prince,

601
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,160
and sobriquet "Prince Jing"

602
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,920
You go out for the battle with me

603
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,560
to expand the borders of South Desolation.

604
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:45,830
Father,

605
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:47,950
forgive my boldness, please

606
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,040
withdraw your order.

607
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:52,070
Are you against the imperial edict?

608
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,520
Father,

609
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,950
I beg you to forgo the expedition on the grounds that

610
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:59,520
Qin Shangcheng has voluntarily

611
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:01,000
relinquished the testamentary edict.

612
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,230
Father,

613
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:04,760
I may not be a prince,

614
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:06,590
or I may not have a title.

615
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,560
As long as you are willing to forgo the battle in Tianchu,

616
00:34:10,429 --> 00:34:11,800
I'll pay my life.

617
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:13,870
Presumptuous!

618
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:26,760
Bai,

619
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,230
do you know

620
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:31,280
why I sent you to Tianchu

621
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:32,870
as a hostage?

622
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:36,870
It's for the sake of Prince Mu's Residence

623
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:39,389
not to be overthrown by the imperial power.

624
00:34:40,909 --> 00:34:41,600
Exactly.

625
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,150
Remember, Bai.

626
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:48,190
In this predatory world,

627
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,520
even if South Desolation doesn't go out for a battle,

628
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,469
when Tianchu becomes strong,

629
00:34:52,469 --> 00:34:54,000
it will also send troops to conquer us.

630
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:55,000
But father...

631
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,949
I have already decided.

632
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:01,280
Remember,

633
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:04,520
you will always be my son.

634
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:21,800
My Lord. Her Highness.

635
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,230
There's another piece of news from the front.

636
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:25,320
Duanmu Qingcang has personally
led his troops to Tianlu City.

637
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:28,230
It seems that Duanmu Bai

638
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:30,080
failed to stop his expedition.

639
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,080
Given his character,

640
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,360
he must have done his best.

641
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:34,670
Perhaps,

642
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:36,080
he has something difficult to tell.

643
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,430
Never mind, sister.

644
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:38,800
We all know that

645
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,430
the root of the matter

646
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:42,390
is Duanmu Qingcang.

647
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:43,470
Rong,

648
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,390
let's set out to Tianlu City immediately

649
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,670
to assist my father-in-law.

650
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:49,670
My Lord,

651
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:52,120
Wouldn't we have to fight your father?

652
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:52,600
Well.

653
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,280
The South Desolation Emperor, right?

654
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:57,630
Something

655
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,280
turned out to be solved sooner or later.

656
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:01,760
Qin Shangcheng,

657
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:03,320
no matter what happens,

658
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:05,280
I will be with you.

659
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:07,800
Crab.

660
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,390
Qin Shangcheng.

661
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,670
If you meet Duanmu Bai on the battlefield,

662
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:11,950
please be lenient.

663
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:13,230
Don't worry.

664
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:21,870
Remember,

665
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,230
don't tell him about Daodao.

666
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:25,870
I won't say a word about it.

667
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:27,000
My good sister!

668
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:27,710
Take care.

669
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:28,870
You too.

670
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:08,950
Although Tianchu has suffered a series of defeats,

671
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:09,840
and the morale plummeted,

672
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:12,120
Hua Mantian

673
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,470
was undaunted by it,

674
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:14,320
and instead of retreating,

675
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,710
he chose to pitch a camp in Guanshan Gorge.

676
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:19,080
This gorge

677
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,710
is backed by the precipitous Guan Mountain

678
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:22,360
and blocked by the Heng River in front of it.

679
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:24,760
Hua Mantian

680
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:27,080
is indeed a master of the art of war.

681
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:28,560
It's hard to fight with him.

682
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:30,840
Even so,

683
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:33,390
Hua Mantian could only delay the defeat.

684
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:35,080
There is a great disparity between the two armies.

685
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,040
As long as we build a bridge to cross the river,

686
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,120
Hua Mantian will be defeated finally.

687
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,760
Do what General Zou said.

688
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,520
Build four raft bridges within seven days.

689
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:50,840
Yes, Your Majesty.

690
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,390
Father,

691
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:01,120
Qin Shangcheng will join

692
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:03,870
in this battle personally.

693
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,430
I just want to see

694
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,950
whether Qin Shangcheng

695
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,190
is worthy of being my son.

696
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:37,430
Qian,

697
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,430
how come I haven't seen My Lord for a long time lately?

698
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:43,080
He misses someone every day

699
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,080
so that he has insomnia every night.

700
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,600
He has only one person in mind.

701
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,000
That is Her Highness.

702
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:46,760
Her Highness.

703
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,080
Still Her Highness.

704
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:48,870
Well.

705
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:51,280
Since Her Highness started to

706
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,190
establish a new Imperial Alliance of justice and equality,

707
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,670
all the female soldiers on the island were

708
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:56,840
going on the closed special training.

709
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:58,360
She hasn't seen

710
00:38:58,630 --> 00:38:59,840
Our Lord for half a month.

711
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,710
Her Highness is so ruthless.

712
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:02,320
Well,

713
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,000
you can't blame Her Highness for it.

714
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,040
It's that mad woman's fault,

715
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:06,320
isn't it?

716
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:07,520
After Her Highness put forward the program,

717
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:09,600
she got her female pirates to join her.

718
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,670
And she also got a position as a Minister.

719
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:11,800
Her Highness is misled by her.

720
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,600
However,

721
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,470
since Our Lord promised Her Highness that

722
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:17,520
he would become the man behind her,

723
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,360
he has never refused any of Her Highness's requests.

724
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:21,600
I must keep abreast with Our Lord.

725
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,000
Well,

726
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:24,600
most wives

727
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,120
stay at home to support husband and educate children.

728
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:26,910
While Our Lord,

729
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:27,430
you know,

730
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:29,000
has no wife at home,

731
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,120
and no kid to educate.

732
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:30,320
Right?

733
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,840
No wonder he's suffering from lovesickness.

734
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:57,910
This

735
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,840
is love.

736
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:01,390
I miss Hui as well.
