3
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:48,950
We are here to look for the Imperial Eagle.

4
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,479
Why are you wasting time here?

5
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,360
We can't find the Imperial Eagle

6
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,509
in one day.

7
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:55,830
And you can't work with an empty stomach.

8
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:57,080
Done.

9
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,680
Want some?

10
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:00,230
No.

11
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:01,910
Okay.

12
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:02,720
I'll eat it myself.

13
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,360
Once struck by the anesthetic arrow,

14
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:12,910
you are sure to sleep all day.

15
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,880
Then I'll get the chance to take the Rapier.

16
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:25,320
Let's go.

17
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,440
Help!

18
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,000
Help me, Rong!

19
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:32,270
I am bitten by snakes.

20
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:33,360
Qin Shangcheng!

21
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,550
Qin Shangcheng, are you okay?

22
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,270
Rong!

23
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:36,240
Qin Shangcheng!

24
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,160
Qin Shangcheng!

25
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,600
Rong!

26
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,470
Qin Shangcheng!

27
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,160
Qin Shangcheng!

28
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,520
- Help me suck out the venom!
- Idiot!

29
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,160
Qin Shangcheng!

30
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:43,470
- Maniac.
- Rong!

31
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,440
Help me suck out the venom!

32
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,030
Get up!

33
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:49,550
Get up!

34
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:50,600
Get up!

35
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,550
What's that?

36
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,440
Isn't that good?

37
00:02:58,079 --> 00:02:58,800
Qian,

38
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,320
the Scene Reduction Treatment you come up with

39
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,110
doesn't work.

40
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:03,320
It's the Visual Stimulus Treatment of Scene Reduction.

41
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:04,550
Don't worry, My Lord.

42
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:05,470
I have a plan B.

43
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:06,440
Plan B?

44
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:06,910
Plan B.

45
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,030
Reliable?

46
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:08,880
Absolutely reliable.

47
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:13,240
One more chance.

48
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,270
No problem, My Lord.

49
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:18,750
Duanmu Bai,

50
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,110
I have a problem.

51
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,520
Why did Crab go missing

52
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,470
in Sheng Xin Hotel?

53
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,800
And why did she suddenly

54
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,000
regain her memory one day later?

55
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,190
No green grass by the river,

56
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,190
no talkative donkeys.

57
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:31,079
Don't beat about the bush.

58
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,910
It means that this thing

59
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,520
is none of your business.

60
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,390
Crab and I are sworn sisters.

61
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:39,720
Her business is my business.

62
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:41,670
Are you hiding something from me?

63
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,190
You overthought it.

64
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:44,800
There's nothing I hide.

65
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,030
Really?

66
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,160
I've heard that when people lie,

67
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,030
their hearts will beat faster

68
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,110
and their eyes will avoid contact.

69
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,390
If you dare to look me in the eye,

70
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,270
let me touch your chest,

71
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,000
and answer my question,

72
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,110
I will believe you.

73
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,190
Why not?

74
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:58,550
Well,

75
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:00,630
is Crab your fiancee?

76
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,630
Why is your heart beating so fast?

77
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:11,030
Are you hiding...

78
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:13,240
Boring trick.

79
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,910
You must be hiding something.

80
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,720
You haven't answered my question yet.

81
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,000
That's all for today.

82
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,829
Continue to search for the Imperial Feather tomorrow.

83
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,070
I'll go alone!

84
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,880
If we go aimlessly like this,

85
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,000
we'll never find the Imperial Eagle.

86
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,640
You're not even looking seriously, are you?

87
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,159
Are you tricking me?

88
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:52,510
How about you, Miss White Dove?

89
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,350
Your purpose

90
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,440
is not to find the Imperial Eagle either, is it?

91
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,160
The ancient books say that

92
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,480
the best way to treat amnesia is

93
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,920
to use old objects to awaken memories.

94
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,350
The vital point of the treatment

95
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,760
is to use the patient's cherished stuff

96
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,830
in an unexpected manner

97
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,040
to evoke memories.

98
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,000
It sounds

99
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:35,070
worth trying.

100
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,040
Rong,

101
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:40,159
as soon as you ring this bell,

102
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,040
I'll be there for you.

103
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,159
Qian,

104
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,480
It seems that your Scene Stimulus Treatment

105
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,110
really works.

106
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:49,880
Of course.

107
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,720
Rong?

108
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,320
Hey! What are you doing sneaking around?

109
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:29,950
Tell me!

110
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,350
What?

111
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:32,270
What are you doing?

112
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,070
What are we doing?

113
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:33,880
We...

114
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,640
We...

115
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,670
What on earth do you want to do?

116
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,350
If I say we didn't do it,

117
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,480
she won't believe me.

118
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:03,040
Of course.

119
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:05,270
Stop!

120
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,270
Did you two play tricks on me just now?

121
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,950
No, we didn't, really.

122
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:13,510
Nonsense!

123
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,110
There were no others but you two.

124
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:15,790
It's not us!

125
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:16,160
It's not us!

126
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,160
- Qian, you say...
- There were lots of people.

127
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:17,920
Explain to her.

128
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,880
Zhang, you explain it.

129
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:19,510
I don't know how to explain.

130
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:20,230
You explain it to her.

131
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,000
Zhang, you explain.

132
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,270
You know the situation clearly, right?

133
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:22,640
You...

134
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:28,670
Grrr! Why did you punch us again!

135
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,200
You...

136
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,510
My Lord,

137
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,230
she's coming.

138
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:49,950
Have a shoot.

139
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,760
It can help you perform well.

140
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:55,390
It's enough.

141
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:56,720
Good luck.

142
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:06,600
Rong!

143
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:11,350
Rong, I'm sorry.

144
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,440
Qin Shangcheng?

145
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:52,910
He doesn't carry the Rapier with him.

146
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,640
Where did he put it?

147
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,030
Now,

148
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,280
you may remember that

149
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,590
you are Rong.

150
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:55,910
I believe

151
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,280
you have a jade pendant

152
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,960
hanging on your chest, which is identical to mine

153
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,440
The Mermaid Jade Pendant

154
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,670
is our love token.

155
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:07,150
White Dove,

156
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,590
remember,

157
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,440
you are my fiancee.

158
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:13,880
Dirty dog.

159
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:24,840
Mr. Duanmu,

160
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,590
this way.

161
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,080
Why did she

162
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,400
ask me to come over so late?

163
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,400
You'll know, my lord.

164
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:38,710
Here.

165
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,350
Your Highness,

166
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,520
Mr. Duanmu arrived.

167
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,710
Let him in.

168
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:47,590
Okay.

169
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:50,030
Please.

170
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,470
I don't believe

171
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:26,590
I can't get the truth out of that

172
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:27,110
kept man.

173
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,440
But Your Highness,

174
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,350
no book

175
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,550
can make people speak the truth.

176
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,640
Read again.

177
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:45,840
Oh! Your Highness,

178
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,760
there's a way.

179
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,400
What?

180
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,080
Honey trap.

181
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,280
Why are you leaving?

182
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:26,640
I'm not beautiful?

183
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,880
My dance is not good?

184
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,280
Since you watched my dance,

185
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,110
you have to make up for me.

186
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,470
You may have the charm of a fox.

187
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,400
But you haven't been a master yet.

188
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,000
It doesn't work for me.

189
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,520
Wait...

190
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:11,910
Forget it,

191
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:13,400
I'll give it back to her another day.

192
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:23,960
My Lord,

193
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,200
don't be mad.

194
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,400
Though

195
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,470
this way

196
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,200
didn't work,

197
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,030
we can find other ways.

198
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,230
Qian,

199
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,320
I remember you have a trick up your sleeve.

200
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,400
I can't say that.

201
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:44,320
Say it!

202
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,350
In this case,

203
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,350
there's only one way left,

204
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,400
the world's long-lost method,

205
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:54,910
Desperate Stimulus Treatment.

206
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,000
Desperate Stimulus Treatment,

207
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,640
as its name implies,

208
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,520
is to make the patient watch their loved one

209
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,760
fall into a desperate situation.

210
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,840
In this case,

211
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,670
the patient's brain

212
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,110
will be intensely stimulated.

213
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:06,960
The stimulation

214
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,840
will help her to recover her memory.

215
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:09,760
Rong!

216
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:12,760
Qin Shangcheng!

217
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,710
Qin Shangcheng!

218
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:15,350
Don't die! Qin Shangcheng!

219
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,110
I haven't had a baby with you yet!

220
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,710
Qin Shangcheng!

221
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:21,790
Okay, Rong.

222
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:24,400
Rong,

223
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:25,520
I won't die.

224
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,520
Let's go back to Huarong Island together,

225
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,670
and have a bunch of little pirates.

226
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:29,790
Don't cry.

227
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:32,760
Hug me.

228
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,440
Fine fine fine!

229
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:38,790
What's that?

230
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:41,790
It's better to rely on myself than on others.

231
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:42,960
I'll come up with a method by myself.

232
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,670
I think we performed well.

233
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:46,520
I agree.

234
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:51,960
How's everything going?

235
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,880
Don't worry, My Lord.

236
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,550
I have laid a trap.

237
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:56,030
Qin Shangcheng will be doomed.

238
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:56,960
Good.

239
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:58,760
Waiting for your good news.

240
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,440
The Mermaid Jade Pendant

241
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,590
is our love token.

242
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,590
Imperial Eagle is diurnal,

243
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,880
spending most of the day out foraging for food.

244
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,960
So if we find the eagle's nest,

245
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,030
we can wait for it

246
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:25,470
and find ways to take the Imperial Feather.

247
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,760
Not to mention the difficulty of finding its nest,

248
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:29,550
but even if one is found,

249
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,960
how can we determine
that it is the nest of the Imperial Eagle?

250
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:35,400
I have considered it.

251
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:37,400
The Imperial Eagle is the king of all eagles.

252
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,670
So its nest

253
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,440
must be much bigger than other eagles'.

254
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:42,230
According to my speculation,

255
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:44,640
its nest is probably built in a cave.

256
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:45,880
It makes sense.

257
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:56,320
She must have other purpose

258
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:57,640
as she's so actively searching for
the Imperial Eagle today.

259
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,520
Whatever,

260
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,590
I'll be there for her no matter what she does.

261
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,710
This must be the nest.

262
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,520
The Imperial Eagle must rest here at night.

263
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,000
Let's stay here and keep watch,

264
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:23,760
maybe it will come back in the evening.

265
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:26,590
Come and have a look first.

266
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:28,550
If it is not the nest of the Imperial Eagle,

267
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:30,000
we will waste our time.

268
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:34,880
A trap.

269
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,230
In this case,

270
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,000
the only way to revive Rong's memory

271
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:40,790
is to take a gamble.

272
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,030
You make a point.

273
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,440
Do you think the Imperial Eagle's eggs

274
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,320
can be twice bigger than ordinary eggs?

275
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:55,880
Maybe...

276
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:58,710
Rong!

277
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,680
Qin Shangcheng!

278
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,880
Rong!

279
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:13,310
I, Qin Shangcheng,

280
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:15,400
swear by heaven and earth that

281
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:16,950
I will never leave

282
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:18,400
or forsake Hua Rong.

283
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,829
Qin Shangcheng!

284
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:25,310
Qin Shangcheng! Are you okay?

285
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,680
Wake up, Qin Shangcheng!

286
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,829
Qin Shangcheng!

287
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:28,920
Wake up!

288
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:31,040
Qin Shangcheng, wake up!

289
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,470
Qin Shangcheng!

290
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:35,230
You're awake.

291
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:36,000
Are you okay?

292
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,680
Do you feel alright?

293
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:38,800
Rong?

294
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,400
Rong,

295
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:47,880
you finally come back.

296
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,000
I'm back.

297
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:51,190
I promised to you that

298
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,830
even if we get separated,

299
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,560
I will turn into a mermaid

300
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,430
and come back to find you.

301
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,640
I knew that

302
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:00,640
you will keep your word.

303
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,310
Let me see.

304
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:05,430
Did you get hurt?

305
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:07,040
Are you in pain?

306
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:07,800
No, I'm not.

307
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:10,000
Rong,

308
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,560
tell me

309
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:13,950
what happened during this period?

310
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,640
Last time in the Mermaid Bay,

311
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,230
I fell off the cliff.

312
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:21,920
When I woke up, I was at Chi Hong's place.

313
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,280
As what you said,

314
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,160
you were not amnesiac,

315
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,920
but were hypnotized by the man

316
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,280
behind Duanmu Bai.

317
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,470
And

318
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,800
though I didn't see

319
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,110
the face of that man,

320
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:42,880
I'm sure he is the one

321
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,830
who assassinated us

322
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:45,710
in the Mermaid Bay.

323
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:50,710
I will find that man

324
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,680
and put him to death.

325
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:53,950
Honey,

326
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:54,800
don't underestimate him.

327
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,710
He has lots of dirty tricks.

328
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,280
He deliberately forced

329
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,070
a non-existent memory into my mind,

330
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:01,950
trying to make me their puppet.

331
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,680
But they didn't know that

332
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,350
I pretended to lose my memories.

333
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,470
So now,

334
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:09,070
I and White Dove

335
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,680
are staying in one body.

336
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,950
White Dove repressed me all the time,

337
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:14,590
so I can't come out to see you.

338
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,190
But I know what happened

339
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,590
between you and White Dove

340
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,760
during this period.

341
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,040
Well,

342
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:22,000
you mean that

343
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,350
you could become White Dove anytime.

344
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:28,800
I have a feeling that

345
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:30,800
White Dove will come back

346
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,190
when I fall asleep.

347
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,280
Rong,

348
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:38,920
don't worry.

349
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,920
No matter what it costs,

350
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,590
I'll make you

351
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:44,800
become who you were.

352
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:47,040
I believe you.

353
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:49,110
There's nothing that you can't do.

354
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,190
As long as you are here,

355
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,920
even if I am in dark,

356
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,400
the dawn will come sooner or later.

357
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:02,710
Look!

358
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,040
Fireflies!

359
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:08,950
So beautiful.

360
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:40,680
Your Highness,

361
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,430
why didn't you go to find the Imperial Feather

362
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:43,430
with Duanmu Bai today?

363
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:45,230
And why don't you eat?

364
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,520
After last night,

365
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,800
I don't want to hear his name.

366
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,880
How about

367
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,160
changing our strategy?

368
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,160
We can't deal with the hard one,

369
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,110
so let's pick an easy one.

370
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,280
Your Highness,

371
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,160
we didn't do anything bad.

372
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,040
Don't worry.

373
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,560
As long as

374
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,880
you can answer a question honestly,

375
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,520
we'll let you go.

376
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,000
Otherwise...

377
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:18,280
As long as you don't slap my face,

378
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,560
you can ask any question you want.

379
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:22,520
What's the relationship

380
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,560
between Qin Shangcheng and Crab?

381
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,520
Your Highness,

382
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:33,280
If someone has to take this dirty job,

383
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,230
it should be me.

384
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:42,350
Zhang, do you know that

385
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,400
The Lord and Her Highness

386
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,350
didn't come back last night?

387
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:47,830
Yeah.

388
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:48,950
Qian, do you think

389
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:49,640
we should

390
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,040
tell My Lord about the confession we were forced to give

391
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,470
to the devil yesterday?

392
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:53,040
Zhang,

393
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:53,800
don't wash your dirty linen in public.

394
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,680
Don't mention this thing anymore.

395
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,190
The very mention of her makes me angry.

396
00:21:59,350 --> 00:21:59,920
The Imperial Eagle.

397
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,560
It implies that

398
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,520
its nest is around here.

399
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:07,640
Let's go.

400
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,230
You Lothario.

401
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,520
What did you do to me?

402
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,230
Why can't I recall anything?

403
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,070
Rong, you...

404
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:38,760
Don't touch me!

405
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:40,230
I'm not Rong.

406
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,520
I'm White Dove.

407
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:53,760
Zhang,

408
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,680
did you see that eagle?

409
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:55,880
It must be a female one.

410
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,400
Yeah.

411
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,560
Her Highness?

412
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,230
Where's My Lord?

413
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,560
My Lord,

414
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,160
how did you

415
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:10,640
come from there?

416
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,110
I got it.

417
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:18,070
This is a trap of love.

418
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,640
Last night, the Lord and your Highness...

419
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:20,710
Whoever tells others

420
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:22,470
about last night will die.

421
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:23,560
Alright, your Highness,

422
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,590
I see nothing.

423
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:25,920
I know nothing.

424
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,680
I'm not your Highness.

425
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:30,280
If you call me this again,

426
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,760
I'll cut your tongue.

427
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:34,710
Rong...

428
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:35,680
My name is White Dove!

429
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:46,760
My Lord.

430
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:48,230
She is

431
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,430
White Dove or Her Highness?

432
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:51,680
Tsk, you are stupid!

433
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,040
Though we call her Dove,

434
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,400
she is still Her Highness in our minds.

435
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,190
Am I right, My Lord?

436
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,350
My Lord,

437
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,400
what's our next plan?

438
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:02,760
Send someone to guard the nest.

439
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,160
I'm tired.

440
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:05,830
I'll have a rest.

441
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:07,110
Okay.

442
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:12,520
Crab.

443
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,920
Where did you go, Crab?

444
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,310
My lady

445
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,920
is asking you to go to a restaurant for a drink.

446
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:22,640
I don't think her intention is to drink with me,

447
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,110
but something else.

448
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:24,760
You...

449
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,590
What's your intention?

450
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,190
Then I'll cut to the chase,

451
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:28,950
Crab.

452
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:30,950
I have figured out

453
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:31,880
the truth

454
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,470
from Qin Shangcheng's men.

455
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,830
You were lied to by Duanmu Bai.

456
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:36,520
Before you lost your memory,

457
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,000
your true identity is Hua Rong.

458
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,310
Once again,

459
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,880
I'm White Dove.

460
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,560
I'm not Hua Rong.

461
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:43,950
You are the one who was defrauded

462
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:44,590
instead of me.

463
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:46,680
My fiancee is Duanmu Bai,

464
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,110
but not Qin Shangcheng.

465
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,310
You like Qin Shangcheng.

466
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:51,800
But obviously, he doesn't like you.

467
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:54,160
He's just in cahoots with his men,

468
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,800
using me as an excuse to push you away.

469
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,640
How could you

470
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,680
be so ungrateful?

471
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,000
Meng!

472
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,470
I...

473
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,680
Think about it.

474
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:03,350
I'll deal with other things.

475
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:11,310
Your Highness.

476
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,640
Your Highness, don't be mad.

477
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,950
There are millions of men in the world.

478
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:16,400
Qin Shangcheng isn't the only choice.

479
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,800
Besides, the men chasing you

480
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,560
are lined up from the bow to the stern.

481
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,880
Don't care what Crab said.

482
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,070
After knowing the relationship

483
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,590
between Crab and Qin Shangcheng,

484
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,920
he was out of my list.

485
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,920
I'll never

486
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,920
covet my sister's man.

487
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,680
Your Highness, you are generous.

488
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:34,400
So the one you are angry with

489
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,520
is Duanmu Bai,

490
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:38,070
but not Crab.

491
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,040
I will make Duanmu Bai

492
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,040
settle all the debts he owes to Crab.

493
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,560
It works.

494
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:51,640
It works.

495
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,760
How does Chi Hong

496
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,110
know what happened to Rong?

497
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:57,880
My Lord,

498
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:59,470
you know Zhang.

499
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:00,160
He can never keep secrets.

500
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,350
When asked by that devil,

501
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:02,070
he told her all.

502
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,950
Come on! You spoke much more than me.

503
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:06,760
Whatever.

504
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,520
As long as she won't make troubles,

505
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,280
let her go.

506
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,040
By the way, My Lord,

507
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:15,040
you haven't told us what happened
between you and Her Highness today.

508
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:24,800
Your highness,

509
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:27,040
you should watch out Chi Hong.

510
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,520
I'll make her shrink back from difficulties.

511
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:33,590
If there's information about the Imperial Eagle,

512
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:35,160
I'll tell you immediately.

513
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,070
White Dove,

514
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:43,800
don't forget your mission.

515
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,040
I got it.

516
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,830
White Dove is our Highness,

517
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,040
and Hua Rong is also our Highness.

518
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,470
Qian,

519
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,680
do you think two Highnesses

520
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,710
would fight with each other

521
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,800
in one body?

522
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:05,950
Are you a fool, Zhang?

523
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:07,230
There must be one Highness

524
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:08,470
suppressing the other one.

525
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:09,400
Well,

526
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,430
what about the one

527
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:11,310
who is suppressed?

528
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:12,070
Don't make trouble.

529
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,430
White Dove

530
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:19,680
doesn't love My Lord.

531
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,640
Hua Rong

532
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,000
loves My Lord.

533
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:27,680
As long as we make both of them

534
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,230
fall in love with My Lord,

535
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,110
they can merge into one.

536
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,800
I'm kidding.

537
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,430
I'm kidding.

538
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:41,520
You're right.

539
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,880
White Dove is Rong.

540
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,430
So I should move White Dove by love,

541
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,400
and bring Rong back.

542
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,470
Yes, My Lord!

543
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:54,070
You're right.

544
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,110
Think about it.

545
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:55,590
Loving

546
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,230
starts from knowing.

547
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:58,190
We can take this opportunity

548
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:59,430
to introduce her

549
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:00,470
about all the prestige and wealth of you.

550
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:01,350
I believe no girl

551
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,590
in the world

552
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:04,280
can say no to such a handsome

553
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:04,800
and rich

554
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,040
martial arts master like you.

555
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,040
Yeah.

556
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:11,830
Well,

557
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:13,880
let's have a try.

558
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:15,350
Have a try.

559
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:33,400
Your Highness!

560
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,230
My Lord!

561
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,710
Miss White Dove,

562
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:58,950
today,

563
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:00,520
I'm here to introduce you

564
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,400
about a famous hero in Jianghu,

565
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,430
King Pirate, Qin Shangcheng.

566
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:06,350
I'm not interested in this.

567
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,920
You'll be interested in it

568
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,280
after listening to my introduction.

569
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,950
Qin Shangcheng,

570
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,830
male, lives in Huarong Island.

571
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:15,920
Though he is the King Pirate,

572
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,590
his main business is robbing the rich to help the poor.

573
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,310
And you can see,

574
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:20,470
he is handsome.

575
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:21,400
He is devoted to his love

576
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,280
There's lots of private sea on his property.

577
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:23,920
Six islands.

578
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,830
Eight pirate ships.

579
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:26,310
Thousands of men.

580
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:27,190
If you are

581
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:29,190
willing to marry My Lord,

582
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:30,760
you will be the most powerful person

583
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,590
besides My Lord.

584
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:36,230
Are you done?

585
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,040
Wait!

586
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:37,920
Wait.

587
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,920
These are the deeds

588
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,350
of My Lord's home equity.

589
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,430
These all will be yours.

590
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:43,520
All belong to you.

591
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,400
Miss White Dove,

592
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,470
is there anything else you'd like to know?

593
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:48,800
Boring.

594
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,640
Don't forget your business.

595
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:01,920
My Lord,

596
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:03,000
we screwed up.

597
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,280
What should we do?

598
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:28,400
Why do you follow me?

599
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,830
I have told you.

600
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:31,800
I'm not interested in you.

601
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:35,190
You are not interested in me,

602
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:36,000
but

603
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:38,430
you must be interested in the Rapier.

604
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,000
Do you forget that

605
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,920
we have an agreement.

606
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,640
Being unreasonable like this

607
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,680
and taking things by force

608
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,590
is not your manner.

609
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,430
Don't pretend that you know me very well.

610
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:57,190
Anyway, our common goal

611
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:58,430
is to get the Imperial Feather,

612
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:00,760
right?

613
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,590
I'll help you get the Imperial Feather

614
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:05,310
and be the alliance leader.

615
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:06,590
After that, you give me the Rapier.

616
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,520
Is that okay?

617
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,400
Okay.

618
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:16,070
Come here!

619
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:17,470
Her...

620
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:18,430
D...D...Dove.

621
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:19,920
Oh my.

622
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:21,040
Oh my! Oh my!

623
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,590
They have not made up.

624
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:23,920
And they must not get the Imperial Feather.

625
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:24,880
My Lord!

626
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:25,830
My Lord!

627
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,350
My Lord!

628
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:29,070
My Lord!

629
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,400
What?

630
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,640
The eagle was gone again.

631
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:35,590
This big bird

632
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:37,400
comes and goes without a trace.

633
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,070
When can we

634
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:39,350
get the Imperial Feather?

635
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:45,110
Zhang,

636
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,760
please use your brain, okay?

637
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,350
The big bird was gone,

638
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:50,590
but its egg is here.

639
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:06,560
Stop!

640
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:07,950
Duanmu,

641
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:08,880
why don't you tell me that

642
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,040
you are going to look for the Imperial Feather?

643
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,560
I'll deal with this alone.

644
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,680
You don't need to worry about it.

645
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:13,520
Tsk!

646
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,950
I'm not the kind of person who relies on others.

647
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:17,430
I'm gonna go with you!

648
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,310
Up to you.

649
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,710
Did you see that, Duanmu Bai?

650
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,560
The Imperial Feather has fallen to the valley.

651
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:45,040
Get it if you can.

652
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,470
Looking for the Imperial Feather under the cliff?

653
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,190
No way!

654
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:02,400
It's time to settle the score

655
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,680
between you and Crab.

656
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,710
He did go down.

657
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,000
So high.

658
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,470
I dare not go down.

659
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,160
Is it enough?

660
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:41,280
Shut up!

661
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:46,760
Who knows that the queen of the sea

662
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,680
is scared of the height?

663
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,760
People who know my drawback

664
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,190
have only one end.

665
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,800
That is death!

666
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,909
She doesn't behave herself.

667
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,630
Why did I say where's the egg

668
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:35,710
there's Her Highness?

669
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,000
Think about it.

670
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,280
When the egg hatches into a little eagle,

671
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,429
My Lord will get the opportunity

672
00:34:40,429 --> 00:34:41,949
to look after the little eagle with Her Highness.

673
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:43,389
And it can promote your relationship.

674
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:45,800
I get it.

675
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,760
Since Hui has been pregnant,

676
00:34:48,429 --> 00:34:49,760
we discuss the baby together.

677
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:50,710
We have more topics,

678
00:34:50,949 --> 00:34:51,840
and our relationship becomes better.

679
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,280
Though Rong is cold to me,

680
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:57,910
she is kind and pure inside.

681
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,390
I can take this as a breakthrough.

682
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:01,950
You mean

683
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:04,080
Her Highness can be persuaded by reason
but not cowed by force.

684
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,390
We can move Her Highness

685
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:06,280
by hatching the egg,

686
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,910
and make Her Highness fall in love with My Lord again.

687
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:11,120
Right.

688
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,190
How smart I am!

689
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:16,630
The egg is yellow

690
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,230
and it's getting heavier.

691
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:19,870
I can feel it's warm

692
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:21,120
in my hand.

693
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,760
These are the signs of the shell breaking.

694
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:28,840
Did you mean that this eagle egg

695
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,150
is going to break recently?

696
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:30,670
Yeah.

697
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:31,910
However,

698
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,950
I need you to help me hatch it.

699
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:35,560
How are you going to hatch it?

700
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:47,760
Qian Dayou!

701
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:49,190
Is this

702
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:51,190
what you came up with for hatching the egg?

703
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,560
Isn't that good, My Lord?

704
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,150
In comic books,

705
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,000
there are lots of stories

706
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,670
about bearing babies by other bellies.

707
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:58,040
Hatching the egg by other hens

708
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,190
is not news.

709
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,040
The idea of King Pirate is peculiar,

710
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:06,710
hatching the eagle egg with a hen.

711
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:07,670
Yeah, yeah.

712
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,760
They are all birds.

713
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:16,840
We can have a try.

714
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:19,080
Oh my!

715
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:20,950
Zhang!

716
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,320
Catch it! Catch it!

717
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,390
Don't hide! Don't hide!

718
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:23,870
Come on!

719
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:24,560
When you learn

720
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,950
how to tame the hen,

721
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:27,430
come back to me about hatching the egg.

722
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:28,840
I'll catch you!

723
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,280
Luckily I woke up just in time.

724
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,470
You are meaner

725
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:43,280
than I thought.

726
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:45,000
You are overthinking.

727
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,710
You fainted from fear of heights,

728
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:47,670
and were in poor mental condition.

729
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:50,120
This is a Refreshing Pill for you.

730
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:56,870
Trust me or not.

731
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,470
I have got the Imperial Feather.

732
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:00,470
We can go back to the hotel tomorrow.

733
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,360
Is it taste that bad?

734
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,760
Duanmu Bai, you are on purpose.

735
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,080
The pill is so bitter!

736
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,630
Good medicine is usually bitter.

737
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:46,080
You see, you look

738
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:46,950
better now.

739
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:00,630
What should I do

740
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:02,080
to make Rong come back?

741
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:04,840
Do you have ideas?

742
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:08,520
My Lord,

743
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,560
I got up too early. I'm sleepy.

744
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:12,150
Zhang,

745
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,630
look at the stupid idea you came up with!

746
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:15,870
You said we can think more clearly if we get up early.

747
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:17,120
We have stayed here for such a long time,

748
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,080
but we came up with nothing.

749
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,000
Cut the cackle!

750
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:19,560
You'll stay here all day,

751
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,470
if you can't come up with an idea,

752
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:22,910
My Lord,

753
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,870
the key point is not what we should do.

754
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:26,360
It is that in Her Highness's heart,

755
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:27,800
Duanmu Bai, the bastard,

756
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,760
is much more important than us.

757
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:29,840
So no matter what we do,

758
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,040
it doesn't work.

759
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:32,870
Zhang!

760
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:34,080
What are you saying?

761
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:38,910
You got the point.

762
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,600
The pill that kept man gave me

763
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,080
last night was too strong,

764
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:54,000
which made me in a trance,

765
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:54,910
lost my will,

766
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,120
and missed a great opportunity to teach him a lesson.

767
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,230
Next,

768
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,320
I'll find the chance

769
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,950
to revenge for Crab.

770
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,150
Come on! Don't push me!

771
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:06,430
I can't do this.

772
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:07,600
Just do it.

773
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:09,520
What are you doing furtively?

774
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,120
Your Highness.

775
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,950
Let's have a talk.

776
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,040
I can't believe that you are clever and brave,

777
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,910
but can't deal with Crab.

778
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,080
It's called everything has its vanquisher.

779
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,710
That's because...

780
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:27,670
because My Lord

781
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,840
cares too much about Her Highness.

782
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,710
So he can't deal with her.

783
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,470
Isn't it unreasonable

784
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:33,870
to ask My Highness to do this?

785
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:35,390
Reasonable.

786
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:37,040
That bastard did heartless things first.

787
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,600
No one can blame our pirate regiment

788
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,670
for being cruel and unscrupulous.

789
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:41,430
In a word,

790
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:42,360
would you help me?

791
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,390
Crab and I are sworn sisters.

792
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:46,950
I must make her happy.

793
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:48,870
I must

794
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:49,560
do you the favor.

795
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:50,430
Generous!

796
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:51,000
Thanks!

797
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:53,520
Okay.

798
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,230
Let's do it as our plan tonight.

799
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:05,840
Whether it can succeed or not,

800
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:07,630
thank you.

801
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:09,600
Thank you.

802
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:14,320
The King Pirate

803
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,950
asks others for help for a woman.

804
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,040
Your Highness,

805
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:19,120
no wonder you were interested in him once.

806
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,670
I have a good taste for man.

807
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,760
The next one won't be bad either.

808
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:42,390
It's useless to read it again and again,

809
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:43,560
I've said

810
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,150
you can only delete up to three entries.

811
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:45,710
And

812
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:47,150
the final interpretation is mine.

813
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:48,190
Wait wait.

814
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:52,280
What does this mean that when Chi Hong hits me,

815
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,230
I should say thanks,

816
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:55,710
and I can't hit back or glare at her?

817
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:58,560
The principle is that I am the boss.

818
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,910
You can never hit back and scold back.

819
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:01,320
Okay.

820
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,280
It's okay that you have your principle.

821
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:04,910
Let's put this term aside.

822
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,840
What does this mean?

823
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:10,120
Keep the water warm and rub her back

824
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,190
when Chi Hong takes a bath.

825
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:13,470
Stay with her all night and help count the sheep

826
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:14,230
when Chi Hong has insomnia.

827
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:16,000
Fan in the summer and warm her bed in the winter

828
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:16,950
before Chi Hong sleeps.

829
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:19,560
Do you have an improper intention on me,

830
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,150
and want me to sleep and take bath with you?

831
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:21,870
Bah!

832
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,360
As the yaksha of the sea,

833
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,470
I'll never be interested in a kept man like you.

834
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:25,000
These...

835
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:25,520
Meng!

836
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:26,470
What's the matter!

837
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:29,470
I'm sorry, your highness.

838
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,520
I carelessly

839
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,600
copied the Codes for Couples

840
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,800
in the Temptation of Husband.

841
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,560
Your highness,

842
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:36,840
I did that for you.

843
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:37,600
How dare you!

844
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,470
I...I'm sorry!

845
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:39,560
I'm sorry.

846
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:42,760
Kept man!

847
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,120
Red lips!

848
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:45,190
Dead kept man!

849
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:45,950
Bloody mouth!

850
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:46,600
Fetid kept man!

851
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,080
Stop!

852
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,150
I don't want to talk with you.

853
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:49,120
Poor heir!
