3
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:55,360
Lad.

4
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,310
Who are you?

5
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:57,720
I'm May.

6
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:58,870
Don't worry.

7
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,950
You were just drugged with my strength elimination powder.

8
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,160
No big deal.

9
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,400
Except that you can't use martial arts now.

10
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,910
But only in an hour,

11
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:06,830
you'll recover.

12
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:07,760
What do you want?

13
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,160
Why did you hurt me?

14
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,880
Hurt you?

15
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,000
Lad, please be sensible.

16
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,630
How could I be willing to hurt you?

17
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,240
I noticed you

18
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,270
in the street today.

19
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,750
You're so handsome,

20
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,240
chivalrous and dashing,

21
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,000
extremely elegant and graceful,

22
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,470
that I had a crush on you.

23
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:25,800
So, without your permission,

24
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,960
I took you home directly.

25
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,079
Lad, please forgive me.

26
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,240
I did that only out of my love.

27
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,360
Miss, please be self-respected.

28
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,910
I already have a wife.

29
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,360
It doesn't matter.

30
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,270
Since ancient times, our tribe

31
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,360
has resided after water,

32
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,440
and believed in freedom.

33
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,800
We never stick to

34
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,270
common customs or marriage.

35
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:47,880
Today,

36
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,520
I really got attached to you.

37
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,829
So I really want a romance

38
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:52,829
with you.

39
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,270
Miss,

40
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,390
why not

41
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:56,829
untie me first?

42
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,550
In such a hard way,

43
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,240
no man in the world will be pleased.

44
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:04,270
Our tribe has always been women-dominated.

45
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,110
Women are free to choose

46
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,600
the men they like.

47
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,750
As for men's thought,

48
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,800
I don't care.

49
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,630
Lad,

50
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,160
you just have to be very obedient.

51
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,030
Then I will

52
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,079
make you very pleased.

53
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,360
I'll never cheat on my wife.

54
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,320
Never mind, lad.

55
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:22,470
Our affair

56
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,960
is just between you and me.

57
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,390
Nobody else will know.

58
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,110
Miss, watch your conduct.

59
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,800
I always respect women.

60
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,800
But if you go on like this,

61
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,800
you have to face the consequences.

62
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,079
That you're displeased now

63
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,440
doesn't mean you won't like me later.

64
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:35,829
May.

65
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,079
Dad.

66
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:38,960
Qin Shangcheng.

67
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:39,800
Put your legs down.

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,720
Are you okay?

69
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,390
Dad, are you satisfied now?

70
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,910
If you wanna do anything else,

71
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,160
I will be displeased too.

72
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,390
No.

73
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,800
No more.

74
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,000
Cheng has passed the test

75
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,880
to be my son-in-law.

76
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,320
Great!

77
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,600
Now reorganize your clothes quickly.

78
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,910
Rong, Cheng,

79
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:14,720
this is

80
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,480
the Mermaid Bay outside Tianlu City.

81
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,829
It is also the birthplace of the tribe of Rong's mother.

82
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,040
They are all

83
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,790
descendants of the Mermaid Tribe.

84
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,600
This is the clan elder.

85
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,670
May is her granddaughter.

86
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,350
Your ladyship.

87
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:30,830
Swordsman Qin,

88
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:31,600
Sister Rong,

89
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,760
forgive me for what happened just now.

90
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,040
Today,

91
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:38,670
you two will

92
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:41,270
have the ceremony right here

93
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,510
to become legalized couples then.

94
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,070
It also gets some kind of comfort to

95
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,720
the spirit of Rong's mother in heaven.

96
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:36,950
Dad.

97
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,510
Dad.

98
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,350
Cheng, Rong,

99
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,320
Look at the Mermaid Bay.

100
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:15,000
With beautiful sceneries and pleasing climate,

101
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,350
it is the best place for you young couples to live.

102
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,070
So you two just stay here

103
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:21,070
as long as you wish.

104
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,440
May has already gotten

105
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,510
your wedding room ready.

106
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:27,830
Rong,

107
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,790
you can have fun in Tianlu city during the day.

108
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:31,830
At night,

109
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,480
you just live in the Mermaid Bay.

110
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:34,920
After I married your mother,

111
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,200
your mother and I,

112
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,510
we lived in this place for a few days.

113
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,480
Then we got you.

114
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:44,480
I got it.

115
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,230
You've really considered a lot for us, father.

116
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,600
That's what a father should do.

117
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,040
But,

118
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:54,720
before that,

119
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,830
I have another test for you.

120
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,390
Dad,

121
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,640
I won't allow it.

122
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,070
To tell you the truth,

123
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,440
I

124
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,390
I've gotten the edict calling me back to report

125
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:15,270
and escort Sixth Princess back.

126
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:17,200
We'll leave tomorrow morning.

127
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:18,670
So I wanna have Cheng

128
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:20,480
drink with me. Is that okay?

129
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,720
Rong, a married daughter,

130
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,950
only care about her own husband.

131
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:25,480
I

132
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:28,670
You start to ignore me now.

133
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,510
No, I didn't, daddy.
I feel hurt.

134
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,350
I didn't.

135
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:31,950
All right.

136
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:32,640
Father,

137
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:34,350
Tonight I'm sure to drink with you

138
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,670
to your heart's content.

139
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:37,600
Great!

140
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,600
Then I'll join you too.

141
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:42,670
Rong,

142
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,880
Cheng and I

143
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:47,440
have to talk something about men.

144
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,230
So you just have a rest in your room.

145
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:53,270
All right.

146
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:01,670
Drink it.

147
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:02,270
Cheers.

148
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:09,440
Cheng,

149
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,270
I feel sorry

150
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,510
that I interrupted your sweet time with Rong.

151
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,790
These days,

152
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,440
I've let Rong stay with me.

153
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,790
Actually, I wanna

154
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,510
test

155
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,160
how much you cherish her.

156
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,600
My boy,

157
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,670
as an elder man,

158
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,830
I've seen countless men

159
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,790
have different attitude to their wives

160
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:32,880
after marriage.

161
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,000
Cheng,

162
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,150
I appreciate you very much.

163
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,200
But Rong is my only

164
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,320
baby girl.

165
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:42,150
She is getting married.

166
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,440
Now I have to say

167
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,590
I really feel sad,

168
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,000
and worried.

169
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:49,640
Please,

170
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,400
forgive me for

171
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,350
what happened today.

172
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,280
Cheng,

173
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,960
here's to you.

174
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,840
Father,

175
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,440
please be rest assured.

176
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:06,030
No matter how many tests

177
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,670
I am willing to take them.

178
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,400
Fine.

179
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:13,790
What's the matter, father?

180
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:16,350
Old pains.

181
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:17,400
Old pains.

182
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,790
No big deal.

183
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,710
Cheng,

184
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,440
from now on,

185
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:28,710
it's you who will help me

186
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:30,470
take good care of Rong.

187
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,280
Trust me, father.

188
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,110
I'll value Rong more

189
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,320
than my own life.

190
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,760
I'll never let her feel wronged,

191
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,150
even just a little.

192
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,080
That's great.

193
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,640
I trust you.

194
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,200
Let us drink!

195
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,710
Wang song was killed by Duanmu Qingcang.

196
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,880
He deserved his punishment.

197
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,080
Qian,

198
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,440
Let's propose a toast

199
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:15,200
to Nie Yu's spirit in heaven.

200
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:19,910
Although I am a princess,

201
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,400
and seem to be free,

202
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,470
I can't do anything of my own will.

203
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,590
My father called me back urgently.

204
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:26,710
So I have to leave tomorrow.

205
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:29,790
I'll take Nie Yu's bone ashes

206
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:30,710
back with me.

207
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,150
Let him go home.

208
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,110
Actually, sometimes,

209
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,910
I somewhat envied Nie Yu.

210
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,110
Because at least

211
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,280
in your heart,

212
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,760
there are some space for him.

213
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,230
In my heart,

214
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,280
there are some space for you also.

215
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,080
Really?

216
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:51,200
Could be more specific?

217
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:52,640
My ride.

218
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:56,550
It is at least better than a eunuch.

219
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,400
My Lady,

220
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,710
I'll be your ride from now on.

221
00:10:58,710 --> 00:10:59,320
I can take you

222
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,670
anywhere you want.

223
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:01,230
Really?

224
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:01,590
Yeah.

225
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,320
Let's go.

226
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:03,960
Come on.

227
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:07,840
Hold on.

228
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:09,440
Slow down.

229
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,670
Let's go.

230
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,550
I finally got round to

231
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:30,880
taking it apart and cleaning.

232
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,960
Holy.

233
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,880
Qin Yin, my brother,

234
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,280
The road ahead is too tough.

235
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:11,110
I'm afraid I can't make it.

236
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:13,840
I hope you can take my son away from disputes,

237
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,280
be carefree and happy.

238
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:16,790
Your great kindness,

239
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,000
whenever I can,

240
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,440
I will repay you.

241
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,880
Qin Yin, my brother,

242
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,440
These two things must be put in

243
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,880
by Qin's foster father.

244
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:37,790
They seem to follow the same pattern.

245
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,760
But we don't know what they are.

246
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,880
Then the child mentioned in this letter

247
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,840
is you, right?

248
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,640
These are the token and the rapier

249
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,150
that date back to decades ago.

250
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,910
They belonged to the largest sect in Jianghu,

251
00:12:58,910 --> 00:12:59,550
the Holy Alliance.

252
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,440
The Holy Alliance?

253
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,350
At its height,

254
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:05,670
their leader was

255
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,230
mysteriously missing.

256
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,400
People coveted the leader's position,

257
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:12,840
so they were suspicious of each other.

258
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:15,400
No new leader had been elected.

259
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,280
Since then, the Holy Alliance

260
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,910
started falling apart,

261
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,030
and quitted Jianghu.

262
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,590
Word has it that its secret room

263
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:25,150
stores many treasures and

264
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:27,030
martial arts cheats of the Holy Alliance.

265
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,320
After the death of its leader,

266
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,350
the rapier just disappeared.

267
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,440
To everyone's surprise,

268
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,760
it was hidden

269
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:38,280
in the treasure left by the previous dynasty.

270
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,710
As for the holy token,

271
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,080
only the knights and elder master of the Holy Alliance

272
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,230
were entitled to hold it.

273
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:48,640
What about the rapier?

274
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,230
What's special about it?

275
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,760
Why can nobody pull it out?

276
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,000
This is the internal secret of the Holy Alliance.

277
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,320
I don't know either.

278
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,840
And it's all a thing of the past.

279
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,000
Besides,

280
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:05,000
The Holy Alliance disappeared in Jianghu

281
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,230
more than 20 years ago.

282
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,640
Is your foster father a member of the Holy Alliance?

283
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,670
Well then, are you

284
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,350
also related to the Holy Alliance?

285
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:25,910
I don't know.

286
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,960
And the Holy Alliance

287
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,110
hasn't shown up in Jianghu for two decades,

288
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,790
without leaving any clue.

289
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:33,470
That's weird.

290
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:36,350
But don't worry.

291
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,280
We'll work together to find out

292
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,550
and we're sure to gain something.

293
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,790
So, don't worry about it.

294
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:44,230
I have nothing to worry about.

295
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,400
All are old stories.

296
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,960
Compared with those old things without a clue,

297
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,520
I only care about the person in front of me.

298
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,400
And I cherish you much more.

299
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:56,440
Now the crisis in South Desolation has been solved.

300
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,030
Your dad also allowed me

301
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,520
to look after you, his baby daughter.

302
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,200
Oh.

303
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,640
Could you stop thinking about

304
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,670
other things?

305
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,110
Do your duty as a wife for a few days.

306
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:09,880
Care more about your husband.

307
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:10,910
But I heard that

308
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,710
Mermaid tribe has always been women-dominated.

309
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,760
I think you should do in Rome as Roman do.

310
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,840
You should do something nice to me, right?

311
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:18,590
Okay.

312
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,440
It’s my showtime now.

313
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,590
From the God's blessings,

314
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:39,280
behold the message of the emperor that

315
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,230
Duanmu Qingcang

316
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:42,760
was dictatorial,

317
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,030
ganged up for selfish interests,

318
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,760
and committed treason.

319
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:48,640
Deprive your title of Prince Mu.

320
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,320
Degrade to a commoner.

321
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,080
Put into the prison.

322
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,640
As a warning to others.

323
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,590
The end.

324
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:58,230
Lord,

325
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,030
please allow me to have a few words

326
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,320
with my children.

327
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,840
Thanks, lord.

328
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,550
Bai,

329
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,840
If you go on like this,

330
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:10,960
the whole family

331
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,080
will be implicated,

332
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,520
and never rises again.

333
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,350
Hundreds of lives in our family

334
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:17,910
are all up to you.

335
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:20,150
People's safety in South Desolation

336
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,790
also depends on your decision.

337
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,000
The emperor of South Desolation is incompetent,

338
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,320
The imperial court is torn by dissension.

339
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,320
War alarms raised at all borders.

340
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,030
In turbulent days,

341
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,790
smashing the old and establishing the new are a must.

342
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:32,640
To save the kingdom,

343
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,030
to save our people from turbulence,

344
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,230
you must get the rapier,

345
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,030
enter the secret room,

346
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,280
and find the last emperor's testamentary edict.

347
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,400
Get it?

348
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:45,350
Yes, I get it.

349
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,080
Thanks, lord.

350
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,590
Royal Highness,

351
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:58,350
please.

352
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,280
Dad,

353
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,349
couldn't you stay just two more days?

354
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:21,040
Rong,

355
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,470
I got the news last night.

356
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:25,160
Duanmu Qingcang

357
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,760
has been shorn of military power,

358
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,160
and put into prison.

359
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,000
The Mu's Palace has been

360
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,110
put under house arrest by the emperor.

361
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,280
Tianchu and South Desolation

362
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,520
won't have conflicts

363
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,040
in the short term.

364
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:40,160
Peace can be restored in two regions.

365
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:42,430
Rong,

366
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:43,880
Cheng,

367
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:46,070
You two can enjoy

368
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,560
a comfortable life now.

369
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:50,110
But you two have to make some efforts

370
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,430
to have a baby early.

371
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:53,830
Dad.

372
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,070
Father,

373
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,070
on this matter,

374
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,470
I'll spare no efforts,

375
00:17:58,710 --> 00:17:59,760
and live up to your expectation.

376
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,040
Good.

377
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:05,710
I'd like to have a few more words.

378
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:07,430
Okay.

379
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:08,160
Remember.

380
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:10,070
The one who you love

381
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,800
can restrain your temper.

382
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,560
And the one who loves you

383
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,310
can stand your temper.

384
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:18,640
I'm an experienced hand.

385
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,590
I can tell that Cheng loves you

386
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:22,760
with all his heart.

387
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,040
You should cherish him.

388
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,110
I know it, dad.

389
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,110
Okay.

390
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:29,470
Don't let Six Princess

391
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:30,590
cool her heels.

392
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,280
Let's go.

393
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:31,880
Okay.

394
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:43,350
Your Highness.

395
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,800
Sorry to keep you waiting.

396
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:46,430
General Hua,

397
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:47,110
I have something to say

398
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,230
to sister Rong.

399
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,640
Please yourself.

400
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:51,760
Father,

401
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,190
let me send you off.

402
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:53,190
Okay.

403
00:18:59,040 --> 00:18:59,920
Sister Rong,

404
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,880
If my father hadn't

405
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,830
called me back urgently,

406
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,590
I would like to travel around with you,

407
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,230
and to visit the legendary Huarong Island.

408
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:05,920
Then I can get some luck

409
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,190
from the association with you.

410
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:09,310
Aren't you lucky enough?

411
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:10,950
Since childhood,

412
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,280
I've grown up in the palace,

413
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,520
and been liked by many people.

414
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:14,800
But,

415
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,830
people who really care about me are rare, and

416
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:18,560
those who really understand me are even rarer.

417
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,040
So you and brother Qin,

418
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,160
must cherish each other.

419
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:22,800
Rest assured,

420
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,640
you're sure to meet someone

421
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,950
who knows you and cherishes you.

422
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,280
How can it be easy?

423
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,680
In fact,

424
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,560
if you find with your heart,

425
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,560
you'll see such a person

426
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,520
is right under your nose.

427
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:38,640
Zhang,

428
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,590
where's Qian?

429
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:40,830
Your Highness,

430
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:42,190
he drank too much last night.

431
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,400
He's still in bed now.

432
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:46,920
Please help me send a message to him.

433
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,430
Okay.

434
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,110
Sixth Princess,

435
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,680
it's getting late.

436
00:19:59,040 --> 00:19:59,830
Time to go.

437
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:02,680
Sister Rong, I have to leave now.

438
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,350
Do take care.

439
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,160
You too.

440
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:27,350
I shouldn't have drunk so much.

441
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,520
Brother,

442
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,040
the princess left you a word.

443
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:30,880
What?

444
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:32,350
She said,

445
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,800
Although you are not a fine horse,

446
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,710
well,

447
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:36,350
you're a cute burro.

448
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,430
Don't laugh!

449
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,800
I'd like to show you

450
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,950
how this fine burro

451
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,400
carry the princess back.

452
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,430
Good luck!

453
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:54,400
Lan Tian,

454
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,920
you'd followed me since childhood.

455
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:01,160
I've never treated you

456
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,280
as my servant,

457
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,880
but as my brother.

458
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:12,110
It was because I acted so impetuously

459
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:16,430
that you paid with your life.

460
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,310
And Mu's Palace got in trouble.

461
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,350
Rest assured,

462
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:30,680
I'll get revenge for you,

463
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:33,310
and save my father,

464
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:38,350
and protect everyone in the Palace.

465
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:41,350
From now on,

466
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:43,710
my top priority is to get

467
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,350
the last emperor's testamentary edict.

468
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:48,880
I won't allow anything

469
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,430
or anyone to hold me back.

470
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,350
Go and see it.

471
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,230
Let's go.

472
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,310
Hairpins.

473
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:35,830
Rong,

474
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:37,400
I find that

475
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,070
you're acting oddly today.

476
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,040
How?

477
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,520
Oddly lovely.

478
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,400
Well you're oddly handsome.

479
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,590
Come and take a look!

480
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:50,400
Free sample.

481
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,160
Candies!

482
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:51,680
Samples are free.

483
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,070
We have a lot of varieties.

484
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,310
Help yourself.

485
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,230
It's free to taste.

486
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:58,400
Qin Shangcheng,

487
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,000
what kind of candy do you like?

488
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:02,070
Certainly,

489
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,350
our wedding candy.

490
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,000
You got it right!

491
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:07,680
So sweet.

492
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:16,830
Hello, welcome.

493
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,680
Have a meal or the storytelling?

494
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:21,110
Just give me a moment.

495
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:21,880
Okay.

496
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:23,110
Qin Shangcheng,

497
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:24,400
I just smelled the great aroma of

498
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,880
osmanthus wine in the street.

499
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,830
I'm gonna get a pot.

500
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:29,110
It can go very well with sauce elbow.

501
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,000
Don't bother.

502
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:33,040
I'll have someone buy for us later.

503
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,760
Okay, okay.

504
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,000
They say

505
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,710
the son of the saintess of the Holy Alliance

506
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,230
made a comeback in Jianghu.

507
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:46,430
He's looking for heroes universally,

508
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:49,430
and calling together the scattered

509
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:51,230
members of the Holy Alliance

510
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,400
to attend the Holy Alliance Assembly

511
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,760
to be held in Shengcheng

512
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,470
to elect the new leader of the Holy Alliance.

513
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,920
While the token

514
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:08,280
is the ticket to the Assembly.

515
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:11,800
Come on, Rong,

516
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,400
I remember the braised elbows here

517
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,190
is your favorite, right?

518
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:14,950
Help yourself.

519
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:18,920
Qin Shangcheng,

520
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,950
Whatever your origin is,

521
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,190
how about we participate in the Assembly?

522
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:25,160
Maybe we can find a clue.

523
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,230
More than 20 years have passed.

524
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,190
What's the use of participating in an assembly?

525
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:35,680
What I wanna most now

526
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:36,950
is to lead a happy

527
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:38,880
and carefree life with you.

528
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:40,710
To have our babies.

529
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:41,520
To stay with you forever.

530
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:42,950
But...

531
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:43,590
Say no more.

532
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:44,880
How about, Rong,

533
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:46,000
tomorrow,

534
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,310
we're going back to Huarong Island,

535
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:47,880
okay?

536
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,040
Enjoy the meal.

537
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,640
Qin Shangcheng.

538
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,110
Qin Shangcheng.

539
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,040
It's time for bed.

540
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,880
Qin Shangcheng,

541
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,190
I know you have something on your mind.

542
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,400
I'm your wife,

543
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,110
and the one who knows you best.

544
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,470
You wanna find out your origin,

545
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:51,350
but you fear that it might

546
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:53,280
destroy our hard-earned peaceful life.

547
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,470
Qin Shangcheng,

548
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,110
of course, I wanna stay with you forever.

549
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:01,430
But if we can't find out the truth,

550
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:02,190
our hearts

551
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:04,190
can never have true tranquility.

552
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,590
Now that the clue has emerged,

553
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,430
let's just find out the truth together.

554
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:09,800
So tomorrow,

555
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,160
Before going back to Huarong Island.

556
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,800
We'll head to the Holy Alliance Assembly.

557
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:14,000
I promise you,

558
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,160
after we go back to Huarong island,

559
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,430
I won't go anywhere else.

560
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:24,880
Staying forever with

561
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,040
the love of my life

562
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,520
is really the happiest thing in my eyes.

563
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,800
But such happiness

564
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,350
makes me afraid of losing.

565
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,760
Qin Shangcheng,

566
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,040
let me tell you a story.

567
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,590
It was told by my mom

568
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:41,400
when I was a little girl.

569
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,680
It's a legend about the Mermaid Tribe.

570
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,880
There was a mermaid princess

571
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,430
who fell in love with a human.

572
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,350
But because of the taboo,

573
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:52,430
the human man lost all his memories,

574
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:53,590
and forgot her forever.

575
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:56,070
The mermaid princess was really sad.

576
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:57,680
Her tear

577
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,470
turned into a stream of pearls.

578
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,000
But the latter part

579
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,070
goes on like this

580
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,880
After crying, the mermaid princess

581
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,230
was determined to be strong

582
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:08,000
and brave

583
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,280
to break this curse.

584
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,310
Finally, she found this man,

585
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:13,280
and they lived happily ever after.

586
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:14,760
Their descendants

587
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,400
are the Mermaid Tribe nowadays.

588
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,710
Qin Shangcheng,

589
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:20,880
Do you like the story?

590
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:29,430
Yes, I do like it.

591
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,350
Okay,

592
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,040
then we'll set off tomorrow

593
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:38,520
to Shengcheng.

594
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:42,280
With you being my wife,

595
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:44,400
even if I can't find out my origin,

596
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,160
I feel extremely lucky.

597
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,710
Qin Shangcheng,

598
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,680
don't worry.

599
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,230
You'll never lose me.

600
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,520
Even if we're separated one day,

601
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,470
I'll be like the mermaid princess,

602
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:57,680
trying every means

603
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,920
to come back to you.

604
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,350
Okay.

605
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:37,040
Who are you?

606
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,880
Hand in the rapier,

607
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,710
or your life.

608
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,000
Then let's see

609
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,190
if you have this ability.

610
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:45,950
Fine.

611
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:48,310
Catch alive.

612
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,190
Go.

613
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,560
Qin Shangcheng.

614
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:34,000
Rong.

615
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:17,230
Rong.

616
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:33,830
Rong.

617
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:35,800
Rong.

618
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:37,160
Rong.

619
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:58,040
My lord.

620
00:30:58,950 --> 00:30:59,560
My lord.

621
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,310
My lord.

622
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:00,800
My lord.

623
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,310
We've been looking for you day and night.

624
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:02,800
My lord.

625
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:04,110
Where is Miss Hua?

626
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,310
Rong.

627
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:07,950
Rong.

628
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,520
My lord.

629
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,230
Calm down.

630
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:11,830
My lord.

631
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,230
Rong.

632
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,680
How can I calm down?

633
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,800
Find Rong!

634
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,230
My lord.

635
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:16,760
My lord, calm down.

636
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,880
-Find her!
-My lord.

637
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,350
My lord.

638
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:20,640
Zhang,

639
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:21,640
take him back to rest first.

640
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:22,110
Come on.

641
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:22,520
Let's go.

642
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:39,000
Qin Shangcheng.

643
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,190
Rong.

644
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:45,880
Rong.

645
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:47,760
-Rong.
-My lord.

646
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:48,880
My lord.

647
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:50,760
My lord.

648
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:53,830
Where is Rong?

649
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,640
Where is Rong?

650
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,230
Have you found her?

651
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:58,230
Rong.

652
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,280
No, my lord.

653
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:00,920
My lord.

654
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,680
We've been looking for her for two days.

655
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:08,000
We've searched all the nearby waters.

656
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:09,920
But we tried in vain.

657
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,560
In vain?

658
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:24,830
In vain?

659
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,310
What does it mean?

660
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:35,920
Tell me what does it mean?

661
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:37,950
Tell me why?

662
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:40,350
My lord.

663
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,280
My lord.

664
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,190
Let me go.

665
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,830
Let me go.

666
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:44,760
My lord.

667
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,400
Let me go.

668
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:46,160
My lord.

669
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:47,110
My lord.

670
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:37,950
Trust me, father.

671
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,160
I'll value Rong more

672
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:40,880
than my own life.

673
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:42,560
I'll never let her feel wronged,

674
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,880
even just a little.

675
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:49,160
I'm sorry, father.

676
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,590
I failed to protect Rong well.

677
00:33:59,520 --> 00:33:59,920
My lord.

678
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,880
My lord.

679
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,070
Look what I found.

680
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:03,110
Compass.

681
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:09,360
Compass.

682
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:22,520
Qin Shangcheng,

683
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,760
don't worry.

684
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,560
You'll never lose me.

685
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,840
Even if we're separated one day,

686
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,710
I'll be like the mermaid princess,

687
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:31,040
trying every means

688
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,320
to come back to you.

689
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Still take nothing?

690
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,150
It's been days.

691
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:48,600
We can't let him

692
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,670
go on like this.

693
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:51,560
Yes, we will think about it.

694
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,360
Qian,

695
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:58,800
what should we do?

696
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:08,390
My lord.

697
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,320
Do you wanna abandon us?

698
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,120
You can't

699
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,710
just leave Zhang and me.

700
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,360
Who said I wanna abandon you?

701
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:18,950
Stand up.

702
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:25,910
But my lord，

703
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:28,470
you haven't slept and eaten

704
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:29,430
anything for several days.

705
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:31,000
Doesn't that mean you wanna leave us?

706
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,040
Look.

707
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:39,040
I know this is the compass

708
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,600
that you gave to Miss Hua?

709
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:42,950
This is the clue left by Rong.

710
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,470
The seawater made it malfunctioned.

711
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,910
But its pointer points to the southeast.

712
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,870
Do you know what lies in the southeast?

713
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,430
It's Shengcheng.

714
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,600
It is God who is guiding me

715
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,600
in the dark

716
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,710
to find Rong.

717
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,430
We must set off right now

718
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:07,840
to Shengcheng

719
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,630
to attend the Holy Alliance Assembly.

720
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:12,080
It's an agreement between Rong and me.

721
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:14,360
I'm sure she won't break her promise.

722
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:15,360
Yes, sir.

723
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,520
We'll get things ready right now.

724
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:17,120
Let's do it.

725
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:17,870
Get it.

726
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:18,390
Come on.

727
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:48,840
Marriage comes by destiny.

728
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:51,430
Every jack has his jill.

729
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:52,560
Stop talking nonsense.

730
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,670
Just tell me,

731
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:54,600
after three years,

732
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,560
can our lord win the heart

733
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:58,190
of the King Pirate Qin Shangcheng?

734
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:05,000
Well, Qin Shangcheng

735
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,430
is already married,

736
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:08,150
but our lord can still get him

737
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:10,000
as long as we try some ploys.

738
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,470
As far as I can see,

739
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:13,710
there is a divine opportunity.

740
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,000
Today, in the southeast,

741
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,910
there is a lucky star for your love.

742
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,760
As long as our lord tries some polys,

743
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,190
sorry,

744
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:23,800
gets the lucky star,

745
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,520
your love and marriage will

746
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,190
be well blessed.

747
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:29,520
This is the first time I've heard someone

748
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,870
boast so creative.

749
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,950
I am flattered.

750
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:34,600
Flattered.

751
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,120
Somebody!

752
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:35,840
Yes.

753
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:36,710
Put him into prison.

754
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:37,230
Yes.

755
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,910
Please forgive me.

756
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:40,080
Spare my life, please.

757
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:40,760
Lord.

758
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,870
I still have the latest news.

759
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:43,630
I heard that

760
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:45,230
Qin Shangcheng's wife, Hua Rong

761
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:47,230
drowned in the Mermaid Bay.

762
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,670
In my opinion,

763
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:52,230
it means the serendipity

764
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:54,560
between Qin and his wife has come to an end.

765
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:56,800
And now it's your turn.

766
00:37:58,710 --> 00:37:59,840
Congratulations, lord.

767
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,950
Congratulations, lord.

768
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:02,630
Xiao Meng.

769
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:03,760
Yes.

770
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:05,560
Lord!

771
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,710
Lord!

772
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:07,800
Reward him.

773
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:11,000
A big reward.

774
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:12,430
My lord.

775
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:16,280
Lord, you're really

776
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,470
wise and sensible.

777
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:18,040
Really.

778
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,040
Report.

779
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:20,470
My lord,

780
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:21,760
we just fished a woman

781
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,760
in the southeast wharf.

782
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,190
A woman?

783
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,760
Qin Shangcheng,

784
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,360
why are you in my bed again?

785
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,950
I'm warming your bed.

786
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,120
What if my father finds out?

787
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:02,120
Don't worry.

788
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,120
This time I got a substitute.

789
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,230
Your dad will never know.

790
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:08,390
You're so bad.

791
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:20,910
Cheng,

792
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:24,430
you haven't sleepwalked for days.

793
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,630
It seems that

794
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:28,800
I've cured of your sleepwalking.

795
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,000
I know you're still awake.

796
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:37,470
What about getting up to drink

797
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:38,600
and to chat?

798
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:48,710
That's odd.

799
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:54,560
Cheng never snores at all.

800
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,520
Why it is you?

801
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,000
Wait.

802
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,280
My dad said that

803
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,390
we can't do that before wedding ceremony.

804
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:15,320
So let's just wait till then.

805
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:16,430
How?

806
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,950
Look, it's a rare chance.

807
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:19,230
We haven't been so close for yonks.

808
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:19,840
Give me a kiss.

809
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:20,430
You.

810
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,910
Just once.

811
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:22,360
Okay.

812
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:26,430
Father.

813
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:29,670
No kiss now, right?

814
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:30,560
No, look,

815
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,910
Qian Dayou has sacrificed bravely

816
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:32,710
for our love.

817
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:33,840
We must not let him down.

818
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,910
Come on, quickly.
