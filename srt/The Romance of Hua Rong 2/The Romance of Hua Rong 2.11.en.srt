3
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:38,509
Please go now.

4
00:01:38,509 --> 00:01:39,270
Qin Shangcheng,

5
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,550
I haven't finished yet.

6
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:41,720
It's getting late.

7
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,759
Go back and have a rest, Rong.

8
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:43,680
Qin Shangcheng

9
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,509
I'm having a trial marriage with another man tomorrow.

10
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:47,590
You sure you wanna sleep?

11
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:51,509
Rong, I know

12
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:52,910
you're thinking of a bigger picture

13
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,400
and faking it with Duanmu Bai.

14
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,190
How could I not understand

15
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,630
your good intentions?

16
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:57,800
Well, let's move to another subject.

17
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,190
Did you already know

18
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,400
the Little White Dove thing?

19
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,720
Yes.

20
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,800
Then why didn't you tell me?

21
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,270
You are so good

22
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,240
that there must be thousands of

23
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,910
ignorant fellows who are fond of you.

24
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,910
Moreover, it's just Duanmu Bai's own wishful thinking,

25
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:14,520
so it's not worth mentioning.

26
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,550
Well then,

27
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:17,160
this matter

28
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,720
does not bother you at all?

29
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:24,110
Then why do you have a guilty look

30
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,470
and evasive eyes?

31
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:27,720
That's just because

32
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,079
My eyes just recovered and are a bit

33
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,160
dry.

34
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,390
Well, I believe

35
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:35,910
it's not so much about dry eyes

36
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,079
but a dry heart.

37
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,110
The fearless King Pirate Qin Shangcheng

38
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,520
now knows what fear is.

39
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,030
So what am I afraid of?

40
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,240
Of course me.

41
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:47,720
You are afraid that

42
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,030
the most beautiful and lovely lady in the world

43
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,360
runs away with someone else.

44
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,110
That makes sense.

45
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,030
Suddenly came a man

46
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,960
who's had a secret crush on me for ten years.

47
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,390
If I were you, I'd explode into rage

48
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,079
and could get anxious

49
00:02:58,079 --> 00:02:59,960
and even go crazy.

50
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,750
How could I...

51
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,880
How could I have that feeling

52
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,720
because of Duanmu Bai the young kid?

53
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,000
Impossible.

54
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,750
Good.

55
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,550
Then I can set my mind at rest.

56
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,160
So are we really not discussing

57
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,320
what to do for tomorrow?

58
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,240
Fine.

59
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,440
What's the matter?

60
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:32,240
I

61
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:33,550
think...

62
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,880
I will listen to you.

63
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:56,800
My lord,

64
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,630
I didn't expect that guy surnamed Qin

65
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,470
didn't come.

66
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,670
Well, then,

67
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,360
the matter of the Little White Dove

68
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,880
has a deep impact on Miss Hua.

69
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,960
It was enough to show her sincerity

70
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:07,550
that she came here alone for the trial marriage.

71
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:15,110
Miss Hua.

72
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,790
Your Highness asked for a one-day trial marriage,

73
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,110
so I'll decide on what to do

74
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,160
for the trial marriage.

75
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,670
As you wish.

76
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,040
I heard that Your Highness

77
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,670
grew up with your grandmother,

78
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:25,790
and that you're very close.

79
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,640
So today I want to

80
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,480
pay a visit to her.

81
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:30,950
It's very considerate of you.

82
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,790
So, without further ado,

83
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:33,640
let's go.

84
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,200
Rong,

85
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,350
This cup of tea I want

86
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,550
is not simple.

87
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,720
I'm at your service

88
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,040
for whatever Your Ladyship desire.

89
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,230
The tea should be

90
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,350
transparent in color,

91
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,550
astringent but not bitter,

92
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:52,480
light but not fishy.

93
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,480
Its leaves should be fresh.

94
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,880
The water should be thirty percent cool,

95
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,920
and seventy percent hot.

96
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,550
If it's not to my taste,

97
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:58,390
I'll

98
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,270
splash the tea out.

99
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,230
Please rest assured, Your Ladyship.

100
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:04,230
I believe Your Ladyship

101
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,600
may not be willing to splash the tea I infused.

102
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,160
Miss Hua's brewing technique

103
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,880
of the three-nodding Phoenix

104
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,320
is very skilled.

105
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:18,550
Your Ladyship, please.

106
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,640
She passed it.

107
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,110
OK.

108
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:34,830
Miss Hua,

109
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,390
don't you prepare a present for grandma?

110
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,350
I heard that Your Ladyship

111
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:41,000
like magic tricks,

112
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,040
so I taught myself some moves

113
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,440
to please Your Ladyship.

114
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,790
Hope Your Ladyship will enjoy it.

115
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:45,600
Good.

116
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,040
What I'm going to perform is called

117
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,440
"making something out of nothing".

118
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:57,600
Please watch, Your Ladyship.

119
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,000
It's coming out.

120
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:02,830
-Please.  -Okay.

121
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,760
Okay.

122
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,000
Good luck to Your Ladyship!

123
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:09,510
Good health to Your Ladyship!

124
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,070
Good luck and health to Your Ladyship!

125
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,600
May your fortune be as boundless as the East Sea,

126
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,880
and may you live a long and happy life!

127
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,480
That's good.

128
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,880
You three came just in time.

129
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,880
Of course, presenting gifts to Your Ladyship

130
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,950
allows no delay.

131
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,000
Let me introduce them to Your Ladyship.

132
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:24,830
Okay.

133
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,200
Bai,

134
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,830
do you know the three of them?

135
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,110
Yes.

136
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,480
Rong,

137
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,230
I have searched the whole Prince Mu's Residence,

138
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,600
and found no trace of the emperor's son-in-law.

139
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,600
There's only one place left,

140
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,320
Tianchi Pavilion.

141
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:42,790
-Your Ladyship.  -Well arranged!

142
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,760
Let me introduce him to you.

143
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,880
This is my nephew Qin Shangcheng.

144
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,159
These are all specially arranged

145
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,350
for your pleasure.

146
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:51,480
Nice.

147
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,600
Sine I have an affinity

148
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,510
for your nephew,

149
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,070
I accept your kindness.

150
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,110
By the way, Your Ladyship,

151
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,020
I heard that there is a place in Prince Mu's Residence

152
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:02,760
called Tianchi Pavilion,

153
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,830
which blazes with color,

154
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,230
and houses natural hot springs.

155
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,270
I wonder if you could

156
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:09,000
allow me to see it, Your Ladyship.

157
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,950
You can not only see it,

158
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,270
but bathe yourself in it.

159
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,600
There is a tradition in Duanmu family

160
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,640
that before marriage,

161
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,790
the bride-to-be must go to Tianchi Pavilion

162
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:21,720
with the groom-to-be

163
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,670
to bathe in the holy water of Tianchi

164
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,350
properly dressed,

165
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:29,200
and receive the blessings and baptism of the ancestors.

166
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:37,350
Grandmother,

167
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:39,510
please recall your order.

168
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:42,040
You wish.

169
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,550
Think about it,

170
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:45,510
from your childhood to adulthood,

171
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:47,550
have I ever done anything bad for you?

172
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,830
I beg you to stop.

173
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:50,270
When I was a child,

174
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,760
every time you made a mistake,

175
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:53,390
I'm the one holding the bag.

176
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,480
You still hold the grudge,

177
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,200
little boy.

178
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,230
But marriage

179
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,110
is something big for you.

180
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,790
Don't worry.

181
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:05,640
I know what I'm doing.

182
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:07,390
But grandma,

183
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,270
she may not agree.

184
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,550
It's her business

185
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,000
whether she agrees or not.

186
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,040
Qin Shangcheng

187
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,760
Please...

188
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,880
At present, this is the only chance

189
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,550
to find the emperor's son-in-law.

190
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:23,070
No way.

191
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,510
Someone said last night that

192
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,760
he would believe that I can do it,

193
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,230
and would listen to me.

194
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,720
It turns out to be a lie.

195
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,520
I admit

196
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,840
I've been jealous since the moment

197
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,710
you proposed the trial marriage.

198
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:38,710
Although objectively speaking,

199
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,280
you're doing this

200
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,520
as a last resort to complete the task,

201
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,840
but I just can't accept

202
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,549
my wife

203
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:44,760
to have a trial marriage with another man,

204
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,200
and even bathe in the hot spring with him.

205
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,230
It turns out that the arrogant King Pirate looks like this

206
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,880
when getting jealous.

207
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,150
It's really cute.

208
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,230
Qin Shangcheng

209
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,520
Please...

210
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:54,710
But...

211
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:55,400
There is no "but".

212
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,520
You should remember that

213
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,520
I am the only one in the world

214
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,080
who is allowed to bathe with you.

215
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,000
I remember.

216
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,280
But now this is the only way

217
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,000
to enter Tianchi Pavilion.

218
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,710
I swear

219
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,350
as soon as I find

220
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,710
any clues about the emperor's son-in-law,

221
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:08,000
I will report it to you as soon as possible.

222
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,080
Besides, if Duanmu Bai

223
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,230
does anything inappropriate,

224
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,840
my fly-cutter won't say yes.

225
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,590
He won't have that chance.

226
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:15,960
So you agreed?

227
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,110
Miss Hua,

228
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:23,960
I know

229
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,590
this is hard for you.

230
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,590
But

231
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:28,910
this ceremony

232
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,000
is to pray for our future.

233
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:34,470
Don't worry.

234
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,760
I'm sure

235
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,790
I'll look steadily forward

236
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,000
and be scrupulous.

237
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:42,320
Really?

238
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,110
How can you prove it?

239
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,080
I... I will prove it with my action.

240
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:49,280
Then what action will you take to prove it?

241
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,590
I'm an upright person.

242
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,030
I'll never open my eyes and peek.

243
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:17,710
Miss Hua,

244
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,710
if you feel bored,

245
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:22,960
I can talk with you.

246
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,440
No, I'm good.

247
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:28,470
Miss Hua,

248
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,080
is the water temperature OK?

249
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:32,710
A little bit hot.

250
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,400
It'll be all right in a minute.

251
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,110
Miss Hua,

252
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,960
you don't need to move too much.

253
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,440
Miss Hua.

254
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,200
There's nothing.

255
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,230
The ink is barely dry.

256
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,590
So this painting is fresh drawn.

257
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,000
U live away from the society

258
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,710
to escape enmity.

259
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,760
Piqued waves are getting furious,

260
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,960
a mix of color burnt the sky.

261
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,520
It's at "Utopia".

262
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:04,910
Miss Hua,

263
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,350
although I'm

264
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:07,960
an upright gentleman,

265
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,440
I...

266
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,080
I don't think it's a good idea to do this.

267
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:22,470
Miss Hua,

268
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,520
Let's do it

269
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,470
after we get married.

270
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,670
Your Highness,

271
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,350
it's time to get out of the tub.

272
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,080
What are you doing here?

273
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,910
Where's Rong?

274
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:45,910
So you took your nephew

275
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,200
to replace you

276
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,400
in order to escape the bath.

277
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,520
Your Ladyship,

278
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,670
After pondering over it,

279
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,110
I still think this ceremony is inappropriate.

280
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:55,840
I will only be loyal

281
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,550
to my husband all my life.

282
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,550
According to the custom of Tianchu,

283
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,470
I am not allowed

284
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:02,280
to bathe with any man before marriage.

285
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,350
Do you know the consequences?

286
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:06,840
I'll take everything.

287
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,550
Well.

288
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,400
Guards!

289
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:08,880
Your Ladyship.

290
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:09,710
Grandma.

291
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,280
You're pretty united right now.

292
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:18,230
Would you stop me

293
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:19,910
if I decide to reward Rong?

294
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:23,760
Come on in.

295
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,200
Rong.

296
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,590
Your Ladyship,

297
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:32,350
why are you doing this?

298
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:35,550
This is because you passed the test.

299
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:39,150
If you really took a bath with Bai,

300
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,150
I would drive you out of the Residence.

301
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,840
Prince Mu's Residence will never accept

302
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,670
such an indiscreet

303
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,760
and disrespectful woman.

304
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:50,880
Come here.

305
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:53,960
Here you are.

306
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,520
Thank you.

307
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,080
Okay.

308
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,550
That is to say

309
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:05,790
Nie Yu has been transferred to

310
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:06,840
Utopia at this moment.

311
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,280
In that case,

312
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:09,880
Your Highness,

313
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,550
why don't you just

314
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,790
end your trial marriage with that young kid?

315
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,440
Let's go straight to Utopia to rescue the son-in-law.

316
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,520
Qin Shangcheng

317
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,320
What's your opinion?

318
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,840
Of course I don't want you

319
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,760
to continue acting with him,

320
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,840
but it's really not the right time.

321
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:25,880
Why? My Lord.

322
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,280
Because we need Duanmu Bai

323
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,710
to help us save the emperor's son-in-law.

324
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,200
According to my observation with Rong,

325
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,840
Duanmu Bai doesn't seem to

326
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,080
know anything about the emperor's son-in-law.

327
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,030
The person who's guarding him

328
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:39,960
should be

329
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,640
Zou Yitian.

330
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,110
Seeing that we were coming to Prince Mu's Residence,

331
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,710
he transferred the emperor's son-in-law

332
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:47,030
to Utopia in advance.

333
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,960
Let's continue, Rong.

334
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:50,760
Therefore,

335
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,110
there must be

336
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:53,350
many South Desolation spies

337
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,440
guarding the emperor's son-in-law nearby.

338
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,280
So now the situation is that

339
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:57,790
it's easy to find the emperor's son-in-law,

340
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,840
but it is impossible

341
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,110
to take him

342
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,400
out of Utopia.

343
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,110
Oh, I see.

344
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,080
You are

345
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,470
trying to save him from Utopia quietly

346
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:10,230
through the help of

347
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:11,710
that young kid

348
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,960
under the guise of the trial marriage.

349
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:14,550
Is that right, Your Highness?

350
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:15,320
Exactly.

351
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:17,760
Rong,

352
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:19,670
I'm sorry that you have to bear it

353
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,440
for another half day.

354
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,080
As long as you're not mad at me for this.

355
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,200
Of course not.

356
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:28,150
Miss Hua,

357
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,590
do you know

358
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,000
the meaning of the jade bracelet

359
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,840
my grandmother gave you?

360
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,790
It is handed down from the older generations of my family.

361
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:36,910
Back then,

362
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:38,350
my grandmother put it

363
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,640
on my mother's hand personally.

364
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:41,230
Sadly,

365
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:42,910
she died early.

366
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,550
My grandmother recognized you as her granddaughter-in-law,

367
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:47,550
so she gave this jade bracelet to you.

368
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,760
After finishing the task,

369
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,030
I'll tell him as soon as possible

370
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,520
about my relationship with Qin Shangcheng

371
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,320
to dispel his thinking about our marriage.

372
00:15:58,470 --> 00:15:59,150
Miss Hua,

373
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:03,710
what's the next test?

374
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,000
You'll know when you get there.

375
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:20,150
It turns out that

376
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:22,000
you've already laid a snare, Your Royal Highness.

377
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,470
The situation was reversed with only one chess piece.

378
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,550
It's almost time to take action.

379
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,440
Yes, Your Highness.

380
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:11,470
Miss Hua,

381
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,400
you don't want to test me here,

382
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,160
do you?

383
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,160
As the saying goes,

384
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,349
wine is a good test of one's character.

385
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,280
I just want to come here for a drink

386
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,230
to see the conduct of you, Your Highness.

387
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,950
You can totally rest your heart about this, Miss Hua.

388
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:26,349
My Lord never comes to such places.

389
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:27,190
He is a man of integrity,

390
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:28,400
and never flirts with women

391
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,190
or has random love affairs.

392
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,520
That's good.

393
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,400
Mr. Duanmu,

394
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,590
what brings you here?

395
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,400
Watch your manners.

396
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,680
Mr. Duanmu,

397
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,400
Wrong person.

398
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,470
No, no.

399
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,350
You haven't come here for a long time.

400
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:42,400
You got the wrong person.

401
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,000
Rong,

402
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,470
the one dancing in the middle is Xing.

403
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,230
I got it.

404
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:50,950
You may go now.

405
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,470
Watch your manners!

406
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:53,430
Others may mistake you for someone else,

407
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:54,560
but I won't.

408
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,800
It has been ten years, Mr. Duanmu.

409
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,760
Your lovely voice and happy countenance

410
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,880
still linger in my heart.

411
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:02,110
Why don't we have a drink,

412
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,520
and spend the beautiful night together tonight?

413
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,950
Come on!

414
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,310
Let's go, Mr. Duanmu.

415
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,350
You got the wrong person.

416
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,000
Back off.

417
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,430
Your Highness.

418
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,800
Let's go.

419
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,160
Ten years ago?

420
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:20,950
I didn't expect Your Highness to

421
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:22,070
have visited such a place at a young age.

422
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:23,880
She just...

423
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,110
My Lord,

424
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:30,800
we've searched every corner of Utopia,

425
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,710
but we still couldn't find

426
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,110
the whereabouts of the emperor's son-in-law.

427
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:34,560
I guess Nie Yu

428
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,230
is probably locked in a secret room.

429
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,800
A secret room?

430
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:41,640
Looking for a secret room,

431
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,310
someone is more professional than us.

432
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:52,800
Yes, it's right here.

433
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,880
Isn't this a painting?

434
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,760
What's wrong with it?

435
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,760
This is a solid wall.

436
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,110
That's the problem.

437
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,110
These dirt are new,

438
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:07,160
which means that the wall has just been renovated.

439
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,070
And look at the step,

440
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:10,800
there must be something.

441
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:13,160
Are you saying

442
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,280
there's a secret door here?

443
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:15,400
Of course yes.

444
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,190
My Lord,

445
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,040
you are so awesome.

446
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,310
You are awesome, too.

447
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:19,400
You deserve to be from a tomb-robbing family.

448
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:26,040
Please, Miss Hua.

449
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,190
How boring it is to just drink!

450
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,830
How about playing a drinkers' wager game

451
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:30,520
for some fun?

452
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,520
Good!

453
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,230
Whatever you want to play,

454
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:34,560
I'll keep you company.

455
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:36,880
Anybody?

456
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,310
Bring us a pitch pot.

457
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,950
One arrow, one round.

458
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:44,640
Whoever loses

459
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,560
drinks.

460
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:46,280
OK.

461
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,680
It's a deal.

462
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:58,000
My skill of using fly-cutter is the best.

463
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,830
Beating you

464
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,070
is a piece of cake.

465
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,110
On playing pitch-pot game,

466
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:04,280
I'm afraid that you have found the wrong opponent.

467
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:11,230
I can't believe that they trapped

468
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:12,470
His Highness here.

469
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:14,520
How absurd!

470
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:21,230
His Highness has been poisoned,

471
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:22,710
and can't speak yet.

472
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,160
Besides, His Highness is seriously injured.

473
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,520
I'm afraid he won't make it without treatment.

474
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,190
Are you trying to ask

475
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:35,230
why I'm here?

476
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:38,590
I've decided to forgive you,

477
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:39,710
get you out of here first,

478
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:42,000
and then renounce the engagement with you.

479
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,950
So please get better soon.

480
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:46,400
Qin,

481
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,830
the most urgent task now

482
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,470
is to get His Highness out of here.

483
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,350
Find a way to inform Rong

484
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:53,830
that she can take action now.

485
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:54,470
OK.

486
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:02,800
I didn't even realize he was good at archery.

487
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:03,640
No,

488
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,560
if we keep playing like this,

489
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,430
I'll be drunk before he gets drunk.

490
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,310
Miss Hua drinks so actively.

491
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,280
I guess she wants to confide in me

492
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:11,880
when getting tipsy.

493
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,310
Your Highness is really good at archery.

494
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,190
Your archery is also very impressive.

495
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,510
This is the special eel noodles

496
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:23,590
with three shredded ingredients.

497
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,920
It goes best with wine.

498
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,350
Bon appetite!

499
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:30,280
It smells good.

500
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,430
I feel hungry now.

501
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,110
By the way, Your Highness,

502
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,950
according to the custom of Tianchu,

503
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:41,350
musicians and dancers should

504
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,430
perform on the wedding day

505
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,190
to show felicity of husband and wife,

506
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:45,350
and the happiness of love.

507
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,280
I think

508
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,000
these musicians and dancers are pretty good.

509
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,190
If Miss Hua likes them,

510
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:52,590
I'll redeem them immediately.

511
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,800
You know me well.

512
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,280
Then I'll not stand on ceremony.

513
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,040
His Highness is so generous.

514
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:09,760
Miss Hua,

515
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,400
they've all been redeemed.

516
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:18,920
Lan Tian,

517
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,160
take them back to the residence now.

518
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:20,950
Yes.

519
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,430
Everybody, follow me.

520
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:26,800
Wait a minute.

521
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:30,830
Miss Hua,

522
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:34,190
this is the gift I prepared for you.

523
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:41,920
Ten years ago,

524
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:43,920
I saved a wounded carrier pigeon.

525
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:46,430
The letter was written by a little girl

526
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,070
to her mother in heaven.

527
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,470
Since then,

528
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:51,920
there seemed to have been

529
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:53,430
a light in my life.

530
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,280
I've imagined

531
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,160
meeting her countless times.

532
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:58,950
Reading her letter

533
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:01,350
has been the happiest thing for me in the past ten years.

534
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,350
I've been looking for her

535
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,000
for ten years,

536
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,680
and now

537
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:13,230
I've finally found her.

538
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:15,800
My only wish now is to

539
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,680
marry "Little White Dove".

540
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:19,950
You and I

541
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,430
will be united in marriage.

542
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,640
When I first saw Little White Dove,

543
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,160
a rainbow appeared.

544
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:34,040
As long as there is sunshine,

545
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,560
it will be colorful.

546
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,920
Would you like to be my sunshine?

547
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,160
Is there something wrong with him?

548
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,760
She will not.

549
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:53,400
Who's he?

550
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,230
I don't know.

551
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,710
Qin,

552
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,430
you really haven't given up.

553
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,110
Borrowed light won't last long.

554
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,110
Sometimes a moment

555
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,830
is eternity.

556
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,710
That's just your wishful thinking.

557
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:21,560
Nie Yu

558
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:22,800
What's going on?

559
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,560
Nie Yu

560
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:24,560
Nie Yu

561
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,470
Nie Yu

562
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:29,110
You'll be fine, Nie Yu.

563
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,190
Nie Yu

564
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:36,880
Nie Yu, you can't sleep, Nie Yu.

565
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,110
Nie Yu

566
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,640
Nie Yu

567
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,000
Nie Yu

568
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:51,880
Qin Shangcheng,

569
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,000
we gotta get out of here.

570
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,350
No one's leaving.

571
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:02,110
The emperor's son-in-law is the hostage for the peace talks

572
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:03,800
between Tianchu and South Desolation.

573
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,880
You dare to murder His Highness.

574
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:09,280
This is a deliberate sabotage of the peace talks.

575
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,590
Take them down!

576
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:11,190
Wait.

577
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:15,950
Lieutenant General Zou,

578
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,470
His Highness was wounded by an arrow shot from hiding.

579
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,430
So there must be a hidden enemy.

580
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:20,800
Miss Hua,

581
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:23,070
I'm only responsible for arresting people.

582
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:24,350
You'd better

583
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,760
save these words for His Majesty.

584
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:28,350
I dare you!

585
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,310
Lieutenant General Zou,

586
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:33,760
Miss Hua is my fiancée.

587
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:35,230
Are you not afraid of

588
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,310
my father's punishment for your unauthorized action?

589
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,640
This is what His Royal Highness meant.

590
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:45,070
Everybody,

591
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:47,070
He who understands the times is a hero.

592
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,310
Don't forget,

593
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,160
here is South Desolation.

594
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,280
Take them away.

595
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:52,880
Don't you dare!

596
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:55,040
I'll block them.

597
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:55,590
You go first.

598
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:57,800
Zhang Xian, Qian Dayou,

599
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:58,830
you take them away.

600
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,280
My Lord.

601
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,280
We're not leaving.

602
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,520
If you don't want to live,

603
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,920
then be my guest.

604
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:14,950
It was I who started all this.

605
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,350
I am the Sixth Princess of Tianchu, Chu Fengling.

606
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,760
Being the emperor's expectant son-in-law,

607
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,760
Nie Yu betrayed me.

608
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,350
I'm handling family affairs,

609
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,040
should South Desolation intervene as well?

610
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,590
So it's you, the Sixth Princess of Tianchu.

611
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,110
But

612
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,830
this is a major event.

613
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:46,520
Your Highness,

614
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,590
please come with us.

615
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,920
If you want to take Her Highness away,

616
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,070
you got to go through me.

617
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:51,110
Don't worry.

618
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:51,800
It'll be fine.

619
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:05,000
I'll go with you.

620
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:05,830
Please.

621
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,430
Your Highness,

622
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:38,710
now that the Princess has been arrested,

623
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:39,280
and the emperor's son-in-law is dead,

624
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,280
what should we do?

625
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:44,000
My Lord.

626
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,950
Stay calm and be quiet.

627
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,920
Now things are happening in ways we didn't expect.

628
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:52,470
The emperor's son-in-law died suddenly.

629
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,430
All we can do is to leave South Desolation first,

630
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,950
and then make another plan.

631
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:59,040
But being in the central region of South Desolation,

632
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:00,560
how could we leave?

633
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,310
What is our biggest prop

634
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,710
in South Desolation?

635
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,590
The Rapier.

636
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:10,710
Yes.

637
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,640
It is because of the Rapier

638
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,920
that Duanmu Qingcang dare not act rashly and blindly.

639
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:16,950
In order not to arouse their suspicions,

640
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,590
the wedding should go on as usual.

641
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:20,830
I'll get the Rapier

642
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:21,560
as a bargaining chip

643
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,400
in exchange for Rong and the Princess.

644
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,000
The Rapier is of vital importance to us.

645
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,310
Just in case,

646
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,110
I will go with you

647
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,520
tomorrow.

648
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:08,880
Nie Yu

649
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,880
Nie Yu

650
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:03,110
Dayou.

651
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:17,760
Dayou.

652
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,760
The preserved fruits taste really good.

653
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,430
If sister Princess tastes it,

654
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:22,640
she will surely love it.

655
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:26,880
Dayou,

656
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:28,560
Sister Princess

657
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:30,400
is the kind of person

658
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,800
you said you fell in love at the first sight, right?

659
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:34,640
Yes.

660
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:38,310
When I first met her,

661
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:39,920
I knew

662
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:41,640
I would never

663
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,040
love anyone but her in my life.

664
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:48,880
Sister Princess is excellent indeed.

665
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,880
I liked her from the first time

666
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,110
I saw her.

667
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,590
Dayou,

668
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,800
we both have a great discernment

669
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,040
in the choice of friends.

670
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:59,280
You're just a few months younger than the Princess.

671
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,190
You call her sister.

672
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,520
It seems that I am out of her generation,

673
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:07,230
but there is a big difference indeed.

674
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:08,160
It's nothing like that.

675
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:09,590
Swordsman and Princess

676
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,040
are a match made in heaven.

677
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:15,110
Do you really think so?

678
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:18,040
I believe you

679
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,230
more than you do.

680
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:21,350
You must be able to rescue the Princess.

681
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:41,590
This is the situation right now.

682
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:43,040
When Qin Shangcheng

683
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,430
gets the Rapier,

684
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,710
we can wipe out them

685
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:46,560
at one fell swoop.

686
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:48,880
Bai,

687
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:50,880
you lead the troops tomorrow

688
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,350
to cooperate with Lord Wang

689
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,520
to ensure that we'll get the Rapier.

690
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:03,230
If you have no other instructions,

691
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:05,520
I will leave first, Your Royal Highness.

692
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,710
I heard that

693
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:12,920
you tried to keep Hua Rong safe.

694
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,830
If Yitian hadn't taken my token,

695
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:16,800
today's plan

696
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,110
would have been disrupted by you.

697
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,680
You didn't tell me beforehand,

698
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:24,710
so I didn't know

699
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,430
it was your plan.

700
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,470
Are you blaming me?

701
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:31,920
I dare not.

702
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,110
Bai,

703
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,640
you should remember that

704
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:38,920
everything I do is

705
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:40,190
for the sake of

706
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,680
your future.

707
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:45,920
Besides,

708
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:48,000
people who achieve great things

709
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,230
cannot have the benevolence of women.

710
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:52,400
Everyone who knows about the Rapier

711
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,880
must die tomorrow,

712
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,000
including Hua Rong.

713
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,230
Father,

714
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,830
I like Hua Rong.

715
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,520
Please let her go, father.

716
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,310
Just this once.

717
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:09,830
Thank you, father.

718
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:14,560
But everyone else must die.

719
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:16,000
I'm bound to

720
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
get the Rapier this time.

721
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:18,680
If there's any problem,

722
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,680
I'll deal with it by military law.

723
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:22,680
You may go now.

724
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,400
Why didn't Your Royal Highness tell the heir

725
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,470
that Qin Shangcheng and Hua Rong had already married?

726
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:38,880
Is that necessary?

727
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,160
My Lord,

728
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:48,110
hasn't His Royal Highness promised to

729
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,310
let go of Little White Dove?

730
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,560
Why are you still frowning?

731
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,760
My father just wanted to reassure me

732
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:01,920
so that he could get the Rapier wholeheartedly.

733
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:04,710
I know my father too well.

734
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:07,160
When it's over,

735
00:34:08,469 --> 00:34:09,870
he'll kill Hua Rong.

736
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,120
So what are you going to do next, my Lord?

737
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:16,949
I think I already have plans

738
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,280
for tomorrow's wedding.

739
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,560
Where's Xing?

740
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,840
Why didn't I see her?

741
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,630
She's in a low mood this morning,

742
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:53,000
I think

743
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,560
she's worried about the situation at hand.

744
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,760
We can never go back to Tianchu,

745
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,040
and she and sister

746
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,320
will never see each other again.

747
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:02,630
How about you?

748
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:03,910
How's your preparation going?

749
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:05,390
Everything is all set.

750
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,950
Don't worry, Rong.

751
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,080
Have you forgotten what my family does?

752
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,320
That's good.

753
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,360
Now I have confidence

754
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,390
to take Xing home.

755
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,630
I admire your ingenuity,

756
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,560
my nephew.

757
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,000
I didn't expect you to

758
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:37,560
hide the Rapier in Utopia.

759
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:41,080
After all, in South Desolation,

760
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:42,560
Rong and I

761
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,800
are surrounded by the cruel and ruthless.

762
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:45,040
Any loss

763
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,910
may lead to a death.

764
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,320
Here is the gathering place of senior officials and nobles

765
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,190
in South Desolation, involving all forces and interests.

766
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:54,800
It's not that easy

767
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,040
to find out.

768
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:12,560
Yesterday, I did not confess to you the place

769
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,320
where the Rapier is hidden.

770
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,040
Please forgive me.

771
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:24,190
Never mind.

772
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:25,760
It's understandable to

773
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,560
hold back a trick or two.

774
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:42,910
Nie Yu

775
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,430
Nie Yu

776
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:50,230
What does it mean, uncle?

777
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:05,710
Then I'll

778
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,390
take the Rapier.

779
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:11,280
For the sake of your relationship with me,

780
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:15,320
I can reward you with a whole body.

781
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,230
My Lord,

782
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,120
aren't you going to

783
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,630
take a bath with Miss Hua soon?

784
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:42,840
Isn't it unnecessary for you

785
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,910
to wash your face now?

786
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:46,190
I thought

787
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:47,320
she was going to refuse,

788
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,910
but she accepted.

789
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:50,760
Congratulations, my Lord.

790
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,190
This proves that Miss Hua

791
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:53,910
is no longer wary of you,

792
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:54,600
and has identified you

793
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,000
as her future husband.

794
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,360
This sigh

795
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,560
reveals that

796
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,800
you have some expectations

797
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,150
and some worries at the moment,

798
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:05,760
but I don't know

799
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,910
which gains the upper hand.

800
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:08,280
Of course the worry.

801
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:10,280
A girl's reputation

802
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,560
is more important than her life.

803
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,560
So I can't put her in a disadvantageous situation

804
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:15,360
just because of my own desires.

805
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,800
It makes sense.

806
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,560
Then my Lord, you just need to

807
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,120
be careful with your manners.

808
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:21,910
Of course,

809
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:23,080
I'll do that.

810
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:26,360
But

811
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,710
it is inevitable that there will be some tension and anxiety

812
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,910
in the bathroom of a single man and woman.

813
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:33,190
I've got it!

814
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:34,470
I've heard that

815
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:36,190
green tea can ease the mind and reduce desires.

816
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:38,320
It must can help you calm down,

817
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:39,230
and relieve pressure.

818
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:43,870
You got a point.

819
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:45,120
My Lord,

820
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,120
this is green plum wine

821
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,470
to help you get rid of the cold.

822
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:52,520
Why didn't you say it earlier?

823
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:55,190
You didn't ask.
