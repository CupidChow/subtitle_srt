Tian,

4
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:40,550
Tian,

5
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:41,080
I haven't seen you for a long time.

6
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:41,870
Long time no see.

7
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,310
After you.

8
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:49,590
My Lord,

9
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:51,039
hearing that there are antiques in it,

10
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:52,080
Qian even runs faster than a rabbit.

11
00:01:59,039 --> 00:01:59,360
Chief Shangguan,

12
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,870
come in, please.

13
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,080
There you are.

14
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:03,630
Come on in.

15
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:04,160
Come on.

16
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,680
Please.

17
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,750
Did you find that person?

18
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,750
Chief Shangguan,

19
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,000
I would say,

20
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,190
although the person in the painting has not been found,

21
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:20,960
there are two men in black robes

22
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,960
who covered their faces with black hats

23
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,160
are very suspicious.

24
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,320
Hiding the face,

25
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:32,270
there may be a catch.

26
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,110
Nothing.

27
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:35,670
My Lord has expected that

28
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,360
it's rather hard to handle Hua Rong.

29
00:02:38,829 --> 00:02:40,600
With this Eight Treasures Kirin Dagger,

30
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,470
even if she has a lot of tricks,

31
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,240
at the auction,

32
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,160
there's nowhere to run.

33
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,110
He's coming.

34
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,600
All of you

35
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,720
attend the Qing Hong Villa Auction,

36
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:58,030
as for me,

37
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,630
I'm deeply grateful.

38
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,320
A total of ten collections are up for auction today.

39
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:03,670
The highest bidder wins.

40
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,000
The one-time buyout is ten times the original price.

41
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,110
The first collection

42
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,240
is for warming up.

43
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,160
This item

44
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:14,960
is an exclusive hidden weapon of Swordman Yunhe,

45
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,190
namely, boomerang.

46
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:19,550
Yunhe is a hypocritical villain,

47
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,470
this guy's stuff is worthless,

48
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,829
I won't take it even pay me additionally.

49
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:24,000
Exactly.

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,960
Just a boomerang,

51
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,360
it's not rare at all.

52
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,000
Do not ask where a hero comes from.

53
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:32,910
This boomerang

54
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,600
is made of black crystal,

55
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:35,880
it would cut clean through iron as though it were mud.

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,829
After throwing out,

57
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,670
it can fly back to your hands.

58
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,880
Ordinary hidden weapons cannot be compared with it.

59
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,550
Braggart.

60
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,320
Exactly.

61
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,910
It's true.

62
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,190
Starting price,

63
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,390
one thousand tael.

64
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:57,550
It's truly extraordinary.

65
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,800
I bid two thousand tael.

66
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,880
This bidder offered two thousand tael.

67
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,470
Would someone offer a higher bid?

68
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,440
Two thousand tael, once.

69
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:10,830
Zhang Xian,

70
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,880
what's the matter with Qin?

71
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,800
This item is his exclusive hidden weapon,

72
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,110
now they are selling it at a low price,

73
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:17,510
no doubt he was unhappy.

74
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,269
You mean...

75
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:21,200
Swordman Yunhe is Qin?

76
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,230
I see, Qin has the identity of

77
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:28,000
embodiment of justice, Swordman Yunhe.

78
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,920
Amazing.

79
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,600
Two thousand tael, twice.

80
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,950
Three thousand tael.

81
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,510
This bidder offered three thousand tael.

82
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,550
Would someone offer a higher bid?

83
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:43,640
Qin,

84
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,600
whatever you like,

85
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,720
I will give it to you.

86
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,200
The last thing I need is money.

87
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:48,600
Ten thousand tael.

88
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,070
Buyout at ten times the original price.

89
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,790
Congratulations to Jian Wu

90
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:55,950
for outright purchasing this collection

91
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:56,950
at ten times the original price.

92
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:57,480
Deal.

93
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:58,950
So extravagant.

94
00:04:59,200 --> 00:04:59,640
Great.

95
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,830
How unreasonable!

96
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,110
Bravo!

97
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,720
Wanna compete with me in men?

98
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,880
You're too naive.

99
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,760
Miss Hua bought this boomerang with such a high price,

100
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:09,920
I guess,

101
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,790
you know Swordman Yunhe?

102
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:12,350
Nope.

103
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,040
I think it's well-designed,

104
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,110
it fits my taste.

105
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,350
Fortunately, I was well-prepared this time.

106
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,760
I doubt it,

107
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,350
after a set of interlocking stratagems,

108
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:23,510
can Qin Shangcheng get out of my control.

109
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:31,830
The collection in my hand

110
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,390
is Gilding Plum Blossom Hairpin.

111
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,880
I'll offer 50 thousand tael for buyout.

112
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,040
Congratulations.

113
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,200
This prince is so generous.

114
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,110
Even the hairpin for apology is ready,

115
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,070
winning his heart

116
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,070
is about to be done.

117
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:49,670
Look! Over there.

118
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:50,350
What's it?

119
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,600
Is it Eight Treasures Kirin Dagger?

120
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,640
That's the treasure of General Hua Mantian in Tianchu.

121
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,790
Awesome.

122
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:58,790
That's genuine.

123
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,670
It's so eye-opening today.

124
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:01,720
Right.

125
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:05,110
This is today's finale collection,

126
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,270
Eight Treasures Kirin Dagger.

127
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,320
This dagger

128
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,480
is not only priceless,

129
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,070
its owner,

130
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,760
is the General of Tianchu,

131
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,070
Hua Mantian.

132
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,480
Starting price, 10 thousand tael.

133
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:26,230
My Lord,

134
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,440
why is General Hua's dagger here?

135
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,630
The conspiracy of the Qing Hong Gang

136
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,720
is finally revealed.

137
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,230
He was trying to use this dagger

138
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:33,920
to lure her Highness into being fooled,

139
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,270
then wipe us all out.

140
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,350
Thirty thousand tael.

141
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,390
This girl

142
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,720
offers 30 thousand tael.

143
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,760
Thirty thousand tael, once.

144
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,350
The game would be over this time.

145
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,270
Forget it.

146
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:51,270
My Lord,

147
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,440
if you can dedicate this dagger to his Royal Highness,

148
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,159
it's a nice loot.

149
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,110
My Lord,

150
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,880
wouldn't that reveal the identity of her Highness?

151
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,880
Forty-nine thousand tael.

152
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:10,110
Forty-nine thousand tael, oh my!

153
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:12,920
Is he bidding against me?

154
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:15,000
What on earth is Qin Shangcheng doing?

155
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:17,480
But this number is not an integer.

156
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,320
Could it be...

157
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,550
Each number in the book

158
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:20,880
has a character corresponding to it.

159
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,110
At my childhood,

160
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,760
I used these numbers

161
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,320
to pass the secret code with my friends

162
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,920
Like, "four five",

163
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,950
which means "for me".

164
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,390
Well then,

165
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,000
"five two one" corresponds to...

166
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,600
"into you".

167
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,760
Since this number riddle is so interesting,

168
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,720
let's take it away.

169
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,510
From now on, it's our husband and wife sweet code.

170
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,070
Forty-nine.

171
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:46,440
An intrigue.

172
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,760
Qin Shangcheng wants to remind me that

173
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,500
the Qing Hong Gang tends to lure me

174
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,320
with father's item.

175
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,270
Rong is really smart.

176
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:56,760
This guest offered forty-nine thousand tael.

177
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,159
This price is very high.

178
00:07:58,159 --> 00:07:59,390
Tell me about it!

179
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,640
Fifty thousand tael.

180
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,920
The bid price of the young master is

181
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:04,880
fifty thousand tael.

182
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:08,720
Dayou.

183
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,110
Eighty thousand tael.

184
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:13,040
Wow! Eighty thousand tael.

185
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,880
Such a high price.

186
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,600
Eighty thousand tael.

187
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:16,200
No big deal.

188
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,480
Eighty thousand tael, once.

189
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,920
So crazy!

190
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:22,830
My Lord.

191
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,200
Ready to bait.

192
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:28,200
There's no limit if you look up.

193
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,110
- Eighty thousand tael...
- One hundred thousand tael.

194
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:36,110
Man! One hundred thousand tael!

195
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,320
One hundred thousand tael.

196
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:41,789
This guest offered 100 thousand tael for buyout.

197
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,110
Congratulate him

198
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:43,960
on finally winning.

199
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:44,960
Congratulations.

200
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,910
Good for you.

201
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,150
Congratulations.

202
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,440
As chief Shangguan expected,

203
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,520
the man in black robes bought the dagger at a sky-high price.

204
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:54,710
It seems that

205
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,320
this got to be Hua Rong.

206
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,840
They came here for treasure.

207
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,710
Tonight,

208
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:02,880
they will definitely make a move.

209
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,520
Get it.

210
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,790
I'll appoint someone to keep an eye on them.

211
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,320
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

212
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,080
Here's the boomerang won by Jian Wu.

213
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,760
Here's Zhao's loot,

214
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,880
the Gilding Plum Blossom Hairpin.

215
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,710
The Gilding Plum Blossom Hairpin implies Perfect Couple,

216
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,080
I guess,

217
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,350
you win this for your wife, right?

218
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,080
Is it for me?

219
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,400
Of course, it belongs to you.

220
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:53,640
Dayou,

221
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,910
put this hairpin on her Highness.

222
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:56,350
Got it.

223
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:05,440
Gorgeous.

224
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,150
Do I look beautiful?

225
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,440
Yes.

226
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,080
Well, Qin Shangcheng.

227
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,030
It turned out that this hairpin was not for me.

228
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:14,760
Calm down.

229
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,030
It must be a psychological attack.

230
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,910
I managed to get a game back,

231
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,470
now I must not be trapped.

232
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,110
Certainly, the Death Couple are very much in love.

233
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,790
To show you our appreciation,

234
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:27,440
we prepared a couple room for you.

235
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,590
What?

236
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,110
A couple room?

237
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,880
If Jian Wu wants one,

238
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,840
we can arrange for you.

239
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:36,760
No bother.

240
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:38,760
Okay.

241
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'd like to say bye.

242
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:45,000
Well, tonight,

243
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,030
I'll share a room with Qin for the time being.

244
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,400
Absolutely not!

245
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:54,550
Ling,

246
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,670
you've sacrificed too much for Miss.

247
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,000
How can I just sit back and watch?

248
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,150
You're not married after all.

249
00:10:59,150 --> 00:10:59,960
Am I right, Qian Dayou?

250
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,710
Tell me about it!

251
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,350
It's not fair for you, Ling.

252
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:03,790
So unfair!

253
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:04,520
So, Ling,

254
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,840
you better sleep in my room.

255
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,590
So be it.

256
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:07,000
Deal.

257
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,470
OK.

258
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,470
Jian Wu will share a room with Ling.

259
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,000
My Lord will share a room with Duanmu.

260
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:19,960
Nice.

261
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,320
That's great.

262
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,150
What book are you reading, Rong?

263
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:45,640
I...

264
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,030
I can't believe you read this kind of book.

265
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,080
Oh, I see.

266
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,670
You want to discipline Duanmu Bai after marriage,

267
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,150
don't you?

268
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:54,790
I'll take a look then,

269
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:55,880
to see if there are some tricks

270
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,200
can be applied to Qin.

271
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,000
Ling,

272
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:01,670
it's just something with no real assets,

273
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,280
full of useless girl fights.

274
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:05,640
Alright.

275
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,280
It's too early for me to learn this.

276
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,840
Qin gave me a gilding hairpin after all,

277
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,030
it must be that my confession last night worked,

278
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:15,150
and he falls in love with me gradually.

279
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:18,790
The preparations for Qin Shangcheng are almost done.

280
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,400
Now that internal worries have been removed,

281
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,960
it's time to clear the external dangers.

282
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,670
I'll take a drastic measure

283
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,880
to cut off her expectancy from the root.

284
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,320
Well, Ling,

285
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,030
to be honest,

286
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,150
as his auntie,

287
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,880
I know something about my nephew.

288
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,520
don't be fooled

289
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,470
by his bright and upright image,

290
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:36,150
in private,

291
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,760
he plays a double game.

292
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:38,790
Double?

293
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:40,400
Yeah,

294
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,400
I didn't expect that

295
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,200
Qin actually has a double identity.

296
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,280
You don't say.

297
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,030
He's a perfect lover with a double identity.

298
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:48,110
I can understand the double identity,

299
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,640
but why is lover mentioned?

300
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,150
You see,

301
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,110
in the daytime,

302
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:54,000
he's the rebellious King Pirate,

303
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,710
in the evening,

304
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,710
he'll be the righteous Swordman Yunhe.

305
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,150
A lover with a double identity like this

306
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:58,910
can be counted as

307
00:13:58,910 --> 00:13:59,960
one in a million.

308
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,280
Rong,

309
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,150
tell me

310
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,400
other things about him.

311
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,470
Ling,

312
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,230
you are talking to the right person.

313
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:07,000
You know what,

314
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,880
this fellow

315
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,910
always tends to

316
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,350
be jealous of a rival in love.

317
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,880
There's one thing I don't get.

318
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:19,110
Tell me about that, Qin.

319
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,080
Why did your Highness take a dagger at a high price?

320
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,200
Are you trying to please your aunt?

321
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,640
Why should I please her?

322
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,550
Marrying into the Prince Mu's Residence

323
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,520
is the most supreme luck of her.

324
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,320
When you were on the boat before,

325
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,550
you didn't say that.

326
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:43,400
Didn't you say?

327
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,710
My magic art to identify character is unformed.

328
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,790
However, after these days of getting along,

329
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,280
I found that

330
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,880
she's not good enough for me.

331
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,080
I think she's way out of your league.

332
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,710
Is Qin really such a person?

333
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:03,550
Sure.

334
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,150
He's a jealous man.

335
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,590
Way too far.

336
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,640
To my surprise,

337
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,520
Qin has such an advantage.

338
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:13,470
Oh my Princess,

339
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,790
can jealous be an advantage?

340
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,000
As for a man,

341
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,320
when he falls in love with a girl,

342
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,400
he'll definitely be jealous.

343
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,550
This is the quality that

344
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,880
a good man must possess.

345
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,350
What's more,

346
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:27,320
he tends to solve problems through violence.

347
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,350
Only powerful people

348
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:43,280
are qualified to solve problems through violence.

349
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,520
Besides, for some people,

350
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,960
they should be dealt with by force.

351
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:46,910
Confident.

352
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:47,710
Aggressive.

353
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:49,640
As expected of my perfect husband.

354
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,350
What the hell?

355
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:53,470
Looks like I have to use a trick.

356
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,080
He loves nothing more than

357
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,670
forcing others to obey him.

358
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,440
Who's there?

359
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,350
Excuse me.

360
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:09,030
I just heard the sound of fighting in the room.

361
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:09,910
Are you all right?

362
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:12,640
Nothing.

363
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,710
My wife and I are having a wonderful night.

364
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:16,150
Should it be

365
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:18,150
approved by the Qing Hong Villa at first?

366
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:18,960
Dare not.

367
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,760
Please enjoy yourselves.

368
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,470
If you need anything,

369
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:21,230
just tell me.

370
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:22,230
Get away!

371
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,030
How do you like it, darling?

372
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:38,670
He's such a domineering man,

373
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,110
he doesn't even listen to my discipline

374
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:41,960
sometimes.

375
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,520
Rong,

376
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,640
Do you have any misunderstanding about Qin?

377
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:51,200
You've been talking ill of Qin just now.

378
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,000
Well I think

379
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,880
if Qin has done something wrong,

380
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,960
as his aunt,

381
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,550
you should tolerate your nephew

382
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,150
instead of blaming on him.

383
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,400
Alright, I am the one who haggles over every ounce.

384
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,760
But I still want to thank you, auntie.

385
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,800
Because of you,

386
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,310
I know Qin better.

387
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,710
Why call me auntie?

388
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:10,069
It's a matter of time.

389
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:12,760
Oh I see,

390
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,640
are you afraid that you may sound like a senior?

391
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:16,920
I'm going to bed.

392
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,760
Enjoy yourself.

393
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:48,400
There you are.

394
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,000
We've been waiting here for long.

395
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:53,680
You two stay here,

396
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,280
others follow me.

397
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:58,710
My Lord,

398
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,520
This Qin guy won't wake up, will he?

399
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,880
He was put into unconsciousness
by my knockout drops,

400
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,070
the Moon Shadow.

401
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:05,760
How are things going?

402
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:06,520
Don't worry.

403
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,190
All the people from the Qing Hong Gang were led away.

404
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:08,560
Good job.

405
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,310
Easy trick.

406
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:41,590
Ling,

407
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,040
I must tell you the truth,

408
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,800
it's not fair to keep it from you.

409
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,590
You can't fall in love with Qin Shangcheng anymore.

410
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,590
I understand,

411
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,950
he's outstanding

412
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,710
and easy to catch girls' eyes.

413
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:58,830
But,

414
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,680
he's married,

415
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,760
he loves his wife so much

416
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,310
and so does her wife.

417
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,110
How much?

418
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,310
What are you doing here?

419
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:22,160
Let's enjoy the rare sweet time.

420
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,880
Who wants to share the sweet time with you!

421
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,680
Where is Ling?

422
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,590
Qian Dayou took her back to the inn.

423
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,400
Didn't you act very actively

424
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,680
when you gave her the gilding hairpin?

425
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,350
Why bother Qian Dayou,

426
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,350
why don't you send her yourself?

427
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:41,000
Darling, you got me wrong.

428
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,280
As for the gilding hairpin,

429
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,590
originally, Qian Dayou bought it

430
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:44,710
as a gift to the princess.

431
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:46,310
The collection in my hand

432
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,950
is Gilding Plum Blossom Hairpin.

433
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:48,680
My Lord.

434
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,400
I'll offer 50 thousand tael for buyout.

435
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,400
Can't you read

436
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,830
Qian Dayou's mind?

437
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:07,190
Are you jealous?

438
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:09,710
I like the way you're jealous.

439
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,680
You did that on purpose, right?

440
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,350
Since you like to play with me the tricks of love,

441
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,760
I would be right there.

442
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:17,520
I...

443
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,800
You already knew it!

444
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,470
You lied to me again.

445
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,040
But this time is different.

446
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,830
I didn't make it clear before,

447
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,950
because I just want Rong to understand,

448
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:39,310
as for you and me,

449
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,470
there is no need for these tricks.

450
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,520
It doesn't matter who is more powerful.

451
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:45,400
In my eyes,

452
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,190
you're the most powerful

453
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:48,590
and important person.

454
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,760
As long as you are happy,

455
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,880
I am willing to listen to you forever.

456
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:57,110
Stop on bended knees,

457
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:57,920
come here,

458
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,470
sit down.

459
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,070
I understand.

460
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:04,070
I'm just worried.

461
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,040
What are you worried about?

462
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,070
Before getting married,

463
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,110
I was worried about gain and loss.

464
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,280
It's not easy for you to comfort me,

465
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,880
the next day after married,

466
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,400
I annoyed you.

467
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,000
So,

468
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:21,640
I am afraid that I will not be able

469
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,430
to be a qualified wife.

470
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,800
So I use this method to trick you.

471
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,350
So greedy are you.

472
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:31,110
You just won the first place in the heroine list,

473
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:33,190
now you want the first place in the perfect wife list?

474
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,190
My stupid sweetheart.

475
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,160
We are both husband and wife for the first time,

476
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,350
is it possible that

477
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,920
when you first joined Jianghu,

478
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:44,040
you meant to win the first place?

479
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:49,830
I get it.

480
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,160
When I was a heroine,

481
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,000
I made it step by step.

482
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,640
So,

483
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:55,190
this intensive way

484
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:56,470
should be thrown away.

485
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,000
This time,

486
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,680
on the journey of becoming a couple,

487
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:05,950
I'll be with you forever.

488
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,310
And,

489
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,040
to make amends,

490
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,760
I also prepared

491
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,110
a second honeymoon gift for you.

492
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:21,400
Guess what it is.

493
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:24,070
That's a bonus.

494
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:25,640
Since you are wearing the clothes of Swordman Yunhe,

495
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,230
you must wanna accompany Swordwoman Huahua

496
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:28,470
to eliminate the Qing Hong Gang,

497
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:29,280
and get rid of an evil for the people.

498
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,040
Brilliant.

499
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:51,760
My Lord,

500
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:54,350
there are so many treasures of gold and silver,

501
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,310
they must have done a lot of unsightly deeds

502
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:57,430
over the years.

503
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,560
Find the Rapier first.

504
00:22:58,830 --> 00:22:59,230
Yes, my Lord.

505
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,400
My Lord,

506
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:08,470
look at this.

507
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:10,000
Isn't this the White Jade Pagoda

508
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,070
you mentioned earlier?

509
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,520
Be careful!

510
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:35,800
My Lord.

511
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,280
My Lord,

512
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,310
did I almost die just now?

513
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,350
Be cautious.

514
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:16,520
Yes, my Lord.

515
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,920
Why you?

516
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,590
Did you already know

517
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:51,520
those wearing the black robe are my subordinates?

518
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,590
Oh, please!

519
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:54,830
If it wasn't to save you,

520
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:57,040
I wouldn't wear that rag.

521
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:02,230
When on earth

522
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:03,280
did you know our plan?

523
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:06,190
Such an easy trick,

524
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:07,710
expecting to fool me?

525
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,310
As for this sword,

526
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,070
I'll keep it.

527
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,590
I'm afraid it's not that easy.

528
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:16,310
You can have a try.

529
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,160
Sure.

530
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,560
Stop it.

531
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,590
He can't beat you.

532
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,680
Oh, yeah.

533
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,760
Why you return kindness with hatred?

534
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,350
Watch out.

535
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:26,520
Calm down, you guys.

536
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,350
My house is full of treasures,

537
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:30,230
you can't afford to break them.

538
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:38,680
I almost rose to the bait.

539
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,760
Fortunately, I was prepared.

540
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:41,760
Arrest them.

541
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:51,470
I'm afraid

542
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:53,830
they just follow my orders.

543
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:55,880
Arrest him.

544
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,350
Yes, my Lord.

545
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:02,000
How about I give you another surprise?

546
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,280
Shangguan Hong.

547
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:05,560
Surprised or not?

548
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,190
Astonished or not?

549
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:06,830
Follow me.

550
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,070
Over there.

551
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:14,950
Chief Shangguan.

552
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,560
Forgive my incompetence.

553
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:17,640
These guys

554
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,520
were all disguised by Qin Shangcheng's subordinates.

555
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,560
You're trapped.

556
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,590
Who are you?

557
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:29,950
Who send you?

558
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:35,760
Qian,

559
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,160
they're trapped as planned.

560
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,230
However,

561
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,920
instead of luring the enemy away from his base,

562
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,230
our trick of who watching the watchers is worked.

563
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:44,880
Inept!

564
00:26:59,110 --> 00:26:59,640
Catch up with them

565
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,230
Catch them.

566
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:06,560
Kneel-down.

567
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,800
Do you lose your mind, Shangguan Hong?

568
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,680
As long as I give an order,

569
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,160
they would die.

570
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,800
What do you want?

571
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,230
Calm down.

572
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,830
I just wanted to invite you all

573
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,920
to the second half of the auction.

574
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:37,350
The auction items are these slave girls.

575
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:38,520
If you want them,

576
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:40,470
just offer your price!

577
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:40,950
OK.

578
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:42,310
I give you all the treasures,

579
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:43,070
you let them go.

580
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:47,640
The bargaining chip is not money,

581
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,350
let alone treasure,

582
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:50,920
it's you.

583
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:55,590
Don't you like to be chivalrous?

584
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,680
As long as you're willing to come with me,

585
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,400
as for the lives of these slave girls,

586
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:01,800
I can forgive.

587
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:03,110
Shangguan Hong,

588
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
as the leader of the Qing Hong Gang,

589
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,070
it's nothing to embarrass a weak woman.

590
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:09,920
How about this,

591
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:11,230
let them go,

592
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,520
and I'll come with you.

593
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:13,520
You?

594
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,880
You're worthless.

595
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,350
I just want her,

596
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:17,680
Hua Rong.

597
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:19,640
Qin Shangcheng.

598
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,350
Hua Rong,

599
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:24,350
think about it,

600
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,950
I'll set the tune with one beat of the gong.

601
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:29,400
If it's a deal, you have to come with me.

602
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,040
If not,

603
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,280
they will die.

604
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,760
I'll count to three,

605
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
give me the final word.

606
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:41,950
One.

607
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:42,920
Save it!

608
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,070
Deal.

609
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:48,830
Rong.

610
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:49,920
Qin Shangcheng.

611
00:28:59,040 --> 00:28:59,710
Don't play tricks!

612
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,430
What are you doing?

613
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:28,310
I know

614
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:30,880
Qin Shangcheng is good at tracking people with scent.

615
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,000
What a pity,

616
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,710
with my scent elimination powder,

617
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:36,400
even Qin Shangcheng

618
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,000
will be at his wits' end.

619
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,470
Despicable!

620
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:42,000
Hey you,

621
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:43,310
later,

622
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:46,040
I'll find you a beautiful place to bury you,

623
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,680
let me send you to hell.

624
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:51,830
Hurry up!

625
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:55,880
How do you like?

626
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,560
The scenery here is good, right?

627
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,760
I had nothing against you,

628
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:00,160
why do you want to kill me?

629
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,560
For the sake of you're going to see the King of Hell,

630
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:06,950
I can tell you something about it.

631
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:09,350
Yeah, you had nothing against me.

632
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,470
Except that

633
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:13,830
you want to go to South Desolation to save Nie Yu.

634
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:15,310
The emperor's son-in-law?

635
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,040
What does he have to do with this?

636
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,190
He knew something he shouldn't have known.

637
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:21,880
As a result, you and him

638
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:23,310
are meant to die.

639
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,230
Qin Shangcheng?

640
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:39,950
I'm not too late, huh?

641
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:41,000
Yes.

642
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,520
We first met on an official ship,

643
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,000
that's how you hugged me back then.

644
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:46,680
I was afraid that you would let go.

645
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:49,520
Now even if there is a cliff behind me,

646
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,400
I feel safe as lying in your arms.

647
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:53,280
I'll help you untie the rope.

648
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:53,830
OK.

649
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:57,470
Qin Shangcheng,

650
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,950
there is no time left for you

651
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:00,230
to show your mutual affection.

652
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:07,190
Shangguan Hong,

653
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:09,760
I didn't expect to meet again so soon.

654
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,710
I've used the scent elimination powder for her,

655
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,230
how did you catch up?

656
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:24,110
Didn't expect it to come in handy so soon.

657
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,070
Fess up.

658
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,920
Who instructed you?

659
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,000
You'll never know!

660
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,590
Qin Shangcheng!

661
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,640
Qin Shangcheng!

662
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,280
Are you alright?

663
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,110
I'm fine.

664
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,040
Who instructed you to kill me?

665
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,470
What secret did Nie Yu know about you?

666
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,710
Fess up,

667
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:01,070
and I can spare your life

668
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:11,880
Just hold the tongue if he doesn't want to tell me.

669
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,000
Why did he jump off the cliff?

670
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,950
No one is forcing him.

671
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:15,520
You're right, no one is forcing him.

672
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:16,920
How deep is the cliff?

673
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,400
Rong,

674
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,430
The honeymoon gift I prepared hasn't been delivered yet.

675
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:21,280
Leave him alone.

676
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:21,830
Let me show you.

677
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:22,280
Nice.

678
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:22,800
Let's go.

679
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,350
The time is just right.

680
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,920
This is my gift for you,

681
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:35,800
a fireworks show.

682
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,880
Did you blow up the Qing Hong Villa?

683
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,000
In the Qing Hong Villa,

684
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,880
I've already installed explosives.

685
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,760
Before I came here to save you,

686
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,230
I also ordered Qian Dayou

687
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:50,230
to hand over the villains of Qing Hong Villa

688
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:51,310
to the government for disposal.

689
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:53,190
Does such a honeymoon gift

690
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:54,040
suit your taste, Rong?

691
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,110
I love this.

692
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:00,310
Swordman Yunhe

693
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:02,920
destroyed the Qing Hong Villa with Swordwoman Huahua,

694
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:03,920
In witness whereof.

695
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:07,710
Rong,

696
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,070
The moment you rescued the slave girls

697
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:12,880
reminded me the reason

698
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,110
you take on the mission of royal intermarriage.

699
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:17,830
Because, Rong,

700
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:19,350
is a chivalrous heroine

701
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,470
who has mercy on the people in this world.

702
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:22,920
To be a heroine

703
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:24,640
is not just your merit,

704
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:26,400
but your belief.

705
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,430
I didn't listen to your thoughts before,

706
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:31,190
which is my fault.

707
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:33,230
Thanks.

708
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:35,280
There's a lot that I'm not doing well.

709
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,400
For example,

710
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,880
I took the imperial edict without discussing with you,

711
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,640
and,

712
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,920
I talked nonsense,

713
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,070
and trapped you with the tricks of love.

714
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,040
How about

715
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:45,880
we make pinky swear

716
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,470
to promise we won't make the same mistake from now on?

717
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:48,110
Will you?

718
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:50,400
Sure.

719
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,920
I was worried that

720
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,040
one day you may sacrifice your life

721
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,950
for the sake of chivalry.

722
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,310
Just like this time,

723
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:05,040
you exchange yourself for the slave girls.

724
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:06,950
But for now,

725
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:08,909
there is no need to change,

726
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:10,429
just be yourself.

727
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,150
Because what I like

728
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:14,080
is the way you are.

729
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,389
I will become stronger,

730
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,190
always by your side.

731
00:34:19,469 --> 00:34:19,870
OK.

732
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:22,000
You work hard towards the perfect husband,

733
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,190
and I won't be left behind.

734
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:24,840
I'll work hard towards the perfect wife,

735
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,710
so we'll be a model couple.

736
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,230
Great.

737
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:35,469
Qin Shangcheng,

738
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,389
Are you ok?

739
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:38,080
I'm good.

740
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,150
I guess some sand has been blown into my eyes.

741
00:34:39,429 --> 00:34:40,389
Let me help you.

742
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:41,150
OK.

743
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,469
Feel better?

744
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:46,630
I'm okay.

745
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,909
By the way, Qin Shangcheng,

746
00:34:55,469 --> 00:34:57,470
Where did you get so much gunpowder?

747
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,760
I borrowed them from the princess.

748
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:00,630
Sixth Princess?

749
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,560
So you whispered to her

750
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,080
just to borrow gunpowder?

751
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:08,000
What do you expect?

752
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,150
So you're just playing tricks with her

753
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:11,080
to make me jealous, right?

754
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:12,360
Well, that's right.

755
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:14,600
How dare you!

756
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,390
Qin Shangcheng,

757
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,150
stay here!

758
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,360
You are already awake!

759
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,520
I was fooled again.

760
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:40,470
Without your morning consolation,

761
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:41,360
I just can't get up.

762
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,630
Wait a second.

763
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,120
What are you doing?

764
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:48,630
Why you pulled my hair?

765
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:49,280
You...you!

766
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,870
You pulled a hair out of me just because I kissed you,

767
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:52,280
are you going to make me bald?

768
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,870
I thought there's a gray hair,

769
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:56,430
so I help you pull it out.

770
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:58,470
Alright.

771
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:01,230
Even though there's a gray hair,

772
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:02,630
it's just because I miss you too much.

773
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,470
How are you going to compensate me?

774
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:08,360
Wait a second.

775
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:10,040
To compensate,

776
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,630
I'm taking you somewhere.

777
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:12,710
I have a surprise for you.

778
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:13,080
Come on.

779
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:14,360
I can't wait.

780
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,320
Qin Shangcheng,

781
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:25,870
follow me.

782
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:27,710
OK.

783
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,600
My Lord.

784
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:07,840
My Lord?

785
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:12,630
In your fluting,

786
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:14,360
I heard a melodious sound, with a hint of resentment.

787
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:16,040
Is there something on your mind?

788
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,390
Is it possible that

789
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,910
being rescued by Hua Rong yesterday

790
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:20,950
makes you feel uneasy?

791
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,670
Am I right, my Lord?

792
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,630
Why am I uneasy about her?

793
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,120
As for me,

794
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,910
I never owe anyone.

795
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,230
I was just thinking about

796
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,430
how to repay her favor.

797
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:37,600
That's true.

798
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,150
All over the world,

799
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:40,600
if there is a girl who can catch my Lord's eyes,

800
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,230
she must be Little White Dove.

801
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:52,120
Follow me.

802
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,190
Come on.

803
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:55,710
Please hurry up.

804
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:56,670
It's only been a few days,

805
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:58,600
you already know the Hai City very well.

806
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,560
Sure.

807
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,150
This is your hometown,

808
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:02,760
sure I want to know it like the back of my hand.

809
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,560
Surprise!

810
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,560
Here we are.

811
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:07,320
Sun Rise

812
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:08,280
Literary House.

813
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:10,430
This is not an ordinary Literary House.

814
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:13,230
It's the most popular Sun Rise Literary House.

815
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:15,560
Rong, you're going to...

816
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,280
What?

817
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,710
Only Swordman Yunhe is allowed to set fire,

818
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:19,280
I'm not allowed to light a lamp, right?

819
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:19,710
Come in.

820
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:37,760
Qin Shangcheng,

821
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,430
It is said that the painter here

822
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:40,840
can draw a person's appearance when they are old

823
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,190
by touching the bones.

824
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:43,150
Since

825
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:44,840
you've shared your childhood with me,

826
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,430
and accompanied me in chivalry,

827
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:48,630
then I'll draw what we'll look like when we grow old,

828
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:50,280
to feel the taste of growing old together in advance.

829
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:52,840
Wonderful.

830
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:53,800
Wonderful.

831
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,800
That's wonderful.

832
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,630
At 6:45 p.m.,

833
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:00,840
I, Hua Sanlang,

834
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,800
witnessed a true love.

835
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:05,430
Master,

836
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:06,710
they're here.

837
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,080
Forgive me.

838
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,230
Forgive me.

839
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:13,120
As the saying goes,

840
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,470
Epiphyllum only blooms overnight,

841
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,600
and true love is

842
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,320
once in a lifetime.

843
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,280
My Lord,

844
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,000
please cherish her.

845
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:25,840
Master,

846
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,080
let's start.

847
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,320
OK.

848
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,840
A round face

849
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:55,470
with a tall nose,

850
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:57,430
and round chin,

851
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,950
you're such an outstanding girl,

852
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:03,190
a bravado beauty!

853
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:08,150
Master, you're good at talking nonsense

854
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,470
in a serious manner.

855
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:17,810
Sometimes what you hear is more important

856
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:18,910
than what you see.

857
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,520
For example,

858
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:23,560
the prince is preoccupied now,

859
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:25,840
it's impossible to disguise.

860
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,760
I only need to listen carefully

861
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,870
to know the truth.

862
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,390
Qin Shangcheng,

863
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,670
what happened to you?

864
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:34,950
I'm okay.

865
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,600
He pinches me and it hurts a bit.

866
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:38,630
Princess,

867
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:39,040
your turn.

868
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:40,910
Master,

869
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,950
you said what you hear is more important,

870
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:45,040
I guess you can draw a portrait of my wife

871
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,390
without touching her bones, can you?

872
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,520
The closest distance between me and the girl

873
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,870
is 2 chi [*Chinese foot] plus 3.1 cun [*Chinese inch].

874
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,470
After one hour,

875
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:08,520
You two will get

876
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,950
a stunning painting.

877
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:12,520
Sibao,

878
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,040
get the writing brush and ink ready.

879
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,760
Yes, Master.

880
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:29,560
That's how you look when you're old.

881
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,760
But you still look majestic,

882
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,280
old but still vigorous in mind and body.

883
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:43,630
The way you hold a sword

884
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:44,670
is pretty.

885
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,430
Qian,

886
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:07,080
didn't my Lord only want a book of

887
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,150
the tricks of love?

888
00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:09,950
You bought so many books.

889
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:10,950
What do you want to do?

890
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,150
To win the champion?

891
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:13,710
Zhang,

892
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:14,630
you know what,

893
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,950

buy one and get one free.

896
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,280
As the saying goes, capital can generate profit.

897
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,000
So I just

898
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,150
bought them all back.

899
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:24,710

it's certain to make a fortune.

901
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,430
Good for you.

902
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:27,710
Not much.

903
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:28,910
You have a mind for business.

904
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:29,560
Exactly.

905
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,670
Who do you sell so many books to?

906
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:32,230
Think about it,

907
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:33,710
there are so many brothers in pirate regiment,

908
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:35,360
it's not enough even one for each.

909
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,280
Do you want to make money from our brothers?

910
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:38,950
Don't say that.

911
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:39,630
Am I one of those scumbags

912
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:40,910
who forget friendship for profit?

913
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:42,670
Making money is not the main thing,

914
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:43,230
the point is,

915
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:45,080
to improve the self-cultivation of them.

916
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:46,470

Zhang,

927
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:05,870
except for you and the Lord, we are all bachelors

928
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:07,190
in the pirate regiment, right?

929
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,120
You know what,

930
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,320
selling books is not important,

931
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,280
the most important thing is to help the brothers

932
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,080
solve the major issues in life.

933
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,470
It's win-win.

934
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:14,080
Isn't it?

935
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:16,430
It makes sense.

936
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:17,520
Sure.

937
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,670

Bratty Princess Falls in Love with Me.

943
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,120
Qian,

944
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:35,120
you are solving your major issues, right?

945
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:37,470
I know it!

946
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,230
You embezzled money

947
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:40,600
for your own needs.

948
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:44,320
And you don't want me to debunk your tricks.

Forgive me, Zhang.

951
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,520
Just to meet your own needs.

952
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:47,150
Am I right?
