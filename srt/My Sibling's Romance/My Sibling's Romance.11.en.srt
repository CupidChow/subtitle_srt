1
00:00:00,047 --> 00:00:02,417
(After the Duet Contest ended...)

2
00:00:02,418 --> 00:00:03,777
(On the 12th day, it's the final message in Seoul.)

3
00:00:03,778 --> 00:00:05,488
(Who made your heart flutter?)

4
00:00:05,747 --> 00:00:08,887
(The final message in Seoul)

5
00:00:13,988 --> 00:00:16,097
(Jae Hyung who was chosen by two people...)

6
00:00:16,098 --> 00:00:19,227
(chose Ji Won.)

7
00:00:19,668 --> 00:00:21,868
(I think now's the start.)

8
00:00:25,238 --> 00:00:27,907
(Yong Woo and Cho A confirmed each other's feelings.)

9
00:00:27,908 --> 00:00:30,006
(I felt closer to him.)

10
00:00:30,007 --> 00:00:31,036
(Good night.)

11
00:00:31,037 --> 00:00:32,076
(Good night.)

12
00:00:32,077 --> 00:00:33,176
(Good night.)

13
00:00:33,177 --> 00:00:35,177
(The last heart-fluttering night in Seoul passes.)

14
00:00:35,217 --> 00:00:36,877
(This is my first time going overseas...)

15
00:00:36,878 --> 00:00:38,287
(for a date.)

16
00:00:41,187 --> 00:00:43,957
(Enjoying the nervousness that feels good...)

17
00:00:44,187 --> 00:00:45,657
(and fluttering)

18
00:00:45,658 --> 00:00:47,088
(Cheers.)

19
00:00:48,927 --> 00:00:51,256
(The first date in Singapore...)

20
00:00:51,257 --> 00:00:53,698
(has started.)

21
00:00:54,568 --> 00:00:56,736
(Is there anyone you're attracted to?)

22
00:00:56,737 --> 00:00:58,067
(I thought there wasn't.)

23
00:00:58,068 --> 00:00:59,068
(At the start?)

24
00:00:59,069 --> 00:01:00,208
(Yes, at the start.)

25
00:01:01,038 --> 00:01:03,606
(Even now, saying that I have no concerns...)

26
00:01:03,607 --> 00:01:05,208
(is a lie, to be honest.)

27
00:01:05,847 --> 00:01:07,246
(He had some concerns.)

28
00:01:07,247 --> 00:01:09,077
(That's how he honestly feels.)

29
00:01:09,847 --> 00:01:12,547
(I found out another reality.)

30
00:01:12,648 --> 00:01:15,957
(I'm a bit insecure about Jung Sub's feelings now.)

31
00:01:15,958 --> 00:01:18,627
(His feelings aren't as strong as mine.)

32
00:01:19,758 --> 00:01:24,458
(The first day in Singapore started like that.)

33
00:01:24,997 --> 00:01:26,528
I'm excited.

34
00:01:27,297 --> 00:01:28,398
I'm excited.

35
00:01:29,237 --> 00:01:30,297
It's so fun.

36
00:01:30,637 --> 00:01:32,467
The game of death.

37
00:01:34,038 --> 00:01:35,678
The rain falls and stops.

38
00:01:36,607 --> 00:01:38,278
That side of the sky is clear.

39
00:01:39,407 --> 00:01:41,347
I think we're going towards the clear side.

40
00:01:48,217 --> 00:01:50,558
Even as we were driving to the dating spot,

41
00:01:50,618 --> 00:01:52,887
there were trees all around.

42
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:55,228
"I'm definitely not in Seoul."

43
00:01:55,728 --> 00:01:57,027
I don't think...

44
00:01:57,028 --> 00:02:00,066
I showed my true side in Korea.

45
00:02:00,067 --> 00:02:02,768
I showed a lot of calm side.

46
00:02:02,967 --> 00:02:05,907
I should show him a lot of my bright side in Singapore.

47
00:02:06,037 --> 00:02:09,177
I went with a new mindset.

48
00:02:09,178 --> 00:02:11,238
Nobody's going to work,

49
00:02:11,407 --> 00:02:14,077
and we get to spend time together wholly.

50
00:02:14,078 --> 00:02:17,817
I thought I could talk with people that I haven't yet.

51
00:02:18,148 --> 00:02:21,388
(Ju Yeon and Jae Hyung, a brunch cafe)

52
00:02:31,868 --> 00:02:33,028
Here it is.

53
00:02:36,997 --> 00:02:37,997
Amazing.

54
00:02:38,567 --> 00:02:40,667
The atmosphere's pretty good with the rain too.

55
00:02:42,608 --> 00:02:43,638
Thank you.

56
00:02:44,308 --> 00:02:45,877
- Amazing. - Why?

57
00:02:46,507 --> 00:02:47,807
"Wagyu cheeseburger."

58
00:02:47,808 --> 00:02:49,977
I'm getting one wagyu cheeseburger.

59
00:02:50,417 --> 00:02:52,587
- Gosh, "crab fried rice." - What is it?

60
00:02:52,588 --> 00:02:54,048
We must order it.

61
00:02:55,088 --> 00:02:56,987
We must've gotten comfortable with each other.

62
00:02:56,988 --> 00:02:58,357
- Why? - When we first dated,

63
00:02:58,358 --> 00:02:59,858
even choosing the menu...

64
00:02:59,988 --> 00:03:01,428
- felt awkward. - Really?

65
00:03:01,898 --> 00:03:03,156
"Grilled chicken?"

66
00:03:03,157 --> 00:03:04,627
Right, you like chicken.

67
00:03:06,868 --> 00:03:08,398
- Thank you. - Thank you.

68
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:14,037
- They look amazing. - Seriously.

69
00:03:18,507 --> 00:03:20,678
This is so good. It's crazy.

70
00:03:20,977 --> 00:03:22,148
I'll give you half.

71
00:03:24,717 --> 00:03:27,787
- It's becoming a mess. - I'll eat the smaller part.

72
00:03:28,118 --> 00:03:30,517
Take the one that has a nice shape.

73
00:03:30,518 --> 00:03:32,528
No, I can't give you the destroyed one.

74
00:03:33,058 --> 00:03:34,828
I'll eat the destroyed one.

75
00:03:35,197 --> 00:03:38,058
Since it's raining,

76
00:03:38,428 --> 00:03:41,268
- it rather looks nice. - Yes, it rather feels good.

77
00:03:41,428 --> 00:03:44,268
I'm totally romantic.

78
00:03:45,537 --> 00:03:47,937
- How is it now? Is it romantic? - A poem popped up in my mind.

79
00:03:49,278 --> 00:03:50,436
Say a phrase.

80
00:03:50,437 --> 00:03:51,578
- A phrase? - Yes.

81
00:03:52,977 --> 00:03:56,117
(The romantic man gets deep in thoughts.)

82
00:03:56,118 --> 00:03:58,417
(The audience is full of expectations.)

83
00:03:58,817 --> 00:04:00,917
(Thinking hard)

84
00:04:02,757 --> 00:04:03,787
Rain.

85
00:04:04,417 --> 00:04:05,487
Wind.

86
00:04:06,628 --> 00:04:07,657
A rainstorm?

87
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,796
"Rain," a comma,

88
00:04:11,797 --> 00:04:13,927
and "wind" in the next line.

89
00:04:14,498 --> 00:04:16,268
(Rain, wind)

90
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,208
The title is, "The First Day in Singapore."

91
00:04:22,477 --> 00:04:23,477
It's nice.

92
00:04:23,477 --> 00:04:24,477
Of course.

93
00:04:24,737 --> 00:04:28,278
It looks very simple,

94
00:04:28,717 --> 00:04:30,878
but art starts from something simple.

95
00:04:31,987 --> 00:04:33,917
It starts from giving meanings to things.

96
00:04:34,417 --> 00:04:35,458
I nailed it.

97
00:04:35,987 --> 00:04:38,427
Eat these vegetables.

98
00:04:39,388 --> 00:04:40,926
I'm a romantic guy.

99
00:04:40,927 --> 00:04:43,697
I thought of a poem, so I made it.

100
00:04:43,698 --> 00:04:45,467
I drank too.

101
00:04:45,797 --> 00:04:48,328
(How did Ju Yeon react?)

102
00:04:50,068 --> 00:04:51,867
I think she liked it.

103
00:04:53,938 --> 00:04:57,378
You said you liked a comfortable romantic relationship.

104
00:04:57,677 --> 00:04:58,748
Yes.

105
00:04:58,847 --> 00:05:01,847
But isn't it better to feel fluttered if you can?

106
00:05:02,547 --> 00:05:05,187
Being comfortable doesn't mean I don't feel fluttered.

107
00:05:05,188 --> 00:05:06,617
(Humming)

108
00:05:08,088 --> 00:05:09,486
When I was in a comfortable relationship,

109
00:05:09,487 --> 00:05:10,917
I felt fluttered too.

110
00:05:11,987 --> 00:05:14,688
It's just a matter of whether I feel mentally comfortable or not.

111
00:05:16,498 --> 00:05:18,096
What I mean by comfortable is,

112
00:05:18,097 --> 00:05:20,226
"Can I trust her?"

113
00:05:20,227 --> 00:05:21,667
- "Can I have faith in her?" - Someone you can have faith in?

114
00:05:22,237 --> 00:05:25,406
"Am I the first to her?" Stuff like this.

115
00:05:25,407 --> 00:05:28,008
If I'm sure about these myself,

116
00:05:28,438 --> 00:05:31,606
I feel mentally comfortable...

117
00:05:31,607 --> 00:05:33,847
without struggling.

118
00:05:33,948 --> 00:05:36,317
Being comfortable doesn't mean being like a friend...

119
00:05:36,318 --> 00:05:38,547
without any fluttering.

120
00:05:39,717 --> 00:05:40,818
I ended up understanding it.

121
00:05:41,248 --> 00:05:42,717
Did you end up understanding it?

122
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:45,958
(Han Hye Jin)

123
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:47,257
It's unexpected to hear that...

124
00:05:47,258 --> 00:05:48,527
- from Jae Hyung. - Exactly.

125
00:05:48,528 --> 00:05:50,597
I totally relate to him.

126
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:53,197
- It's different. - I totally relate.

127
00:05:53,198 --> 00:05:54,567
You know what that is, right?

128
00:05:54,568 --> 00:05:55,897
People are clearly divided into two.

129
00:05:55,898 --> 00:05:58,866
Some prefer a comfortable relationship...

130
00:05:58,867 --> 00:06:01,536
whereas some people find it boring if there's no sense of anxiety.

131
00:06:01,537 --> 00:06:03,878
Doesn't being comfortable make you feel fluttered?

132
00:06:04,107 --> 00:06:07,007
When you're feeling comfortable and both of you do nothing.

133
00:06:07,008 --> 00:06:09,546
There's something that comes when it's quiet.

134
00:06:09,547 --> 00:06:11,546
Isn't your focus on doing nothing?

135
00:06:11,547 --> 00:06:12,588
No.

136
00:06:12,688 --> 00:06:15,258
- The vibe of 2pm on Sunday. - Staying still.

137
00:06:15,588 --> 00:06:17,357
When it feels like the air has stopped.

138
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:19,628
I like that vibe.

139
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:20,888
I think...

140
00:06:21,427 --> 00:06:23,897
it's over when you start feeling comfortable.

141
00:06:23,898 --> 00:06:24,958
(Shouting)

142
00:06:26,028 --> 00:06:27,796
- Really? - Really?

143
00:06:27,797 --> 00:06:30,666
- That means you've cooled off. - Really?

144
00:06:30,667 --> 00:06:33,008
But you end up being comfortable around him at one point.

145
00:06:33,508 --> 00:06:34,607
That's the time to end it.

146
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,807
We're still going.

147
00:06:39,307 --> 00:06:40,448
I'm excited.

148
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:43,676
I can't believe that I'm suddenly in Singapore.

149
00:06:43,677 --> 00:06:45,947
Exactly. We came to Singapore before we realized.

150
00:06:45,948 --> 00:06:47,787
When did we come here? Pop.

151
00:06:48,758 --> 00:06:49,917
But I really like it.

152
00:06:51,057 --> 00:06:52,628
Just looking at the palm trees makes me feel happy.

153
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:56,426
"Newton food."

154
00:06:56,427 --> 00:06:58,898
(Yun Ha, Ji Won, Cheol Hyeon, and Yun Jae, Newton Hawker Center)

155
00:06:59,768 --> 00:07:01,467
I love a place like this that looks like a night market.

156
00:07:03,097 --> 00:07:04,198
It looks delicious.

157
00:07:10,008 --> 00:07:11,407
"Let's eat and die?"

158
00:07:12,607 --> 00:07:13,878
It says "let's eat and die."

159
00:07:15,847 --> 00:07:17,277
You ordered soju too.

160
00:07:17,278 --> 00:07:19,487
- It was included in a set. - It was a set.

161
00:07:19,917 --> 00:07:20,917
Today...

162
00:07:22,188 --> 00:07:23,916
Eat well and sleep well.

163
00:07:23,917 --> 00:07:25,257
Yun Ha, you know that it's the four of us.

164
00:07:25,258 --> 00:07:26,786
It's the four of us.

165
00:07:26,787 --> 00:07:28,457
- You're right. - We're those people.

166
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:29,528
You're right.

167
00:07:29,857 --> 00:07:31,197
- Goodness. - The four people...

168
00:07:31,198 --> 00:07:34,666
that like drinking and talking...

169
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:36,698
happened to gather like that.

170
00:07:36,938 --> 00:07:41,366
The team was made up of the people who liked drinking,

171
00:07:41,367 --> 00:07:42,438
so I liked it even more.

172
00:07:42,677 --> 00:07:43,777
(Chili crab is served.)

173
00:07:43,778 --> 00:07:45,747
- Is this chilli crab? - This is chilli crab.

174
00:07:45,748 --> 00:07:46,777
Wear the gloves.

175
00:07:46,778 --> 00:07:48,106
- Gloves. - Gloves.

176
00:07:48,107 --> 00:07:49,217
- Thank you. - Thank you.

177
00:07:49,378 --> 00:07:52,148
- Let's take a selfie. - Sure.

178
00:07:52,818 --> 00:07:54,347
The chilli crab needs to be in the picture.

179
00:08:04,028 --> 00:08:05,726
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

180
00:08:05,727 --> 00:08:07,167
Thank you for the food.

181
00:08:13,467 --> 00:08:15,068
It's delicious.

182
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:16,208
It's good.

183
00:08:16,438 --> 00:08:17,508
It's good.

184
00:08:18,078 --> 00:08:20,047
Give me that. I'll crack it open.

185
00:08:20,608 --> 00:08:22,648
It's better for one person to do it and distribute it, right?

186
00:08:23,278 --> 00:08:25,018
(Working hard)

187
00:08:28,657 --> 00:08:30,656
- Here. - Eat up, Yun Ha.

188
00:08:30,657 --> 00:08:31,857
- It's okay, eat this. - I...

189
00:08:31,858 --> 00:08:33,257
You need to try it.

190
00:08:33,258 --> 00:08:35,157
- You should eat too. - I have the torso.

191
00:08:37,697 --> 00:08:38,697
Take this.

192
00:08:39,768 --> 00:08:41,797
The torso... It's already done. The torso.

193
00:08:42,067 --> 00:08:43,098
Take one each.

194
00:08:45,197 --> 00:08:48,467
I didn't have a chance to come here. I didn't have time to go...

195
00:08:48,468 --> 00:08:49,677
to Southeast Asian countries.

196
00:08:54,008 --> 00:08:55,278
Use chopsticks.

197
00:09:00,447 --> 00:09:03,686
When we ate shellfish at home,

198
00:09:03,687 --> 00:09:06,628
he never removed the shells himself.

199
00:09:06,758 --> 00:09:09,956
He volunteered to break the crab into pieces...

200
00:09:09,957 --> 00:09:11,827
and put one on Yun Ha's plate.

201
00:09:12,728 --> 00:09:14,567
- Yun Jae, you should eat too. - I'm eating.

202
00:09:15,697 --> 00:09:16,868
(Glancing)

203
00:09:17,968 --> 00:09:20,407
And put one on my plate as he was glancing.

204
00:09:20,807 --> 00:09:22,007
Is it good?

205
00:09:22,008 --> 00:09:23,037
(Glancing)

206
00:09:24,878 --> 00:09:25,978
I thought so.

207
00:09:27,778 --> 00:09:29,747
Okay. Here.

208
00:09:29,748 --> 00:09:31,147
And one on Cheol Hyeon's plate.

209
00:09:31,148 --> 00:09:34,117
He distributed it like a mother bird.

210
00:09:34,118 --> 00:09:36,787
The owner here seems really nice.

211
00:09:37,718 --> 00:09:39,927
- Push it with your chopsticks. - Like a neighbour.

212
00:09:40,687 --> 00:09:43,357
I think Yun Jae was a bit confused.

213
00:09:43,358 --> 00:09:45,867
He must've wanted...

214
00:09:45,868 --> 00:09:47,566
to be annoying with me a bit,

215
00:09:47,567 --> 00:09:50,367
but there was Yun Ha beside him...

216
00:09:50,368 --> 00:09:51,968
that he wanted to treat very nicely.

217
00:09:52,368 --> 00:09:54,867
I wouldn't have cracked the shell for her if it weren't for Yun Ha.

218
00:09:54,868 --> 00:09:55,937
I don't care whether she eats or not.

219
00:09:56,177 --> 00:09:57,238
Give me that.

220
00:09:57,837 --> 00:09:58,848
Give me your plate.

221
00:10:03,218 --> 00:10:04,218
I knew it.

222
00:10:05,248 --> 00:10:06,987
I think he must've been confused...

223
00:10:06,988 --> 00:10:09,057
in between the two feelings.

224
00:10:12,457 --> 00:10:13,687
I knew it.

225
00:10:13,888 --> 00:10:15,827
- He... - His aim is Yun Ha.

226
00:10:16,128 --> 00:10:18,397
- Of course. - He thought he had to give her too.

227
00:10:18,398 --> 00:10:19,796
To give the crab meat to Yun Ha,

228
00:10:19,797 --> 00:10:21,326
- he has to do it for everyone. - That's right.

229
00:10:21,327 --> 00:10:22,367
Exactly.

230
00:10:22,368 --> 00:10:25,407
Ji Won's shell might be empty inside.

231
00:10:25,738 --> 00:10:26,868
- That's right. - Don't do that.

232
00:10:27,307 --> 00:10:29,206
He might have given her just the shells.

233
00:10:29,207 --> 00:10:30,677
It might be just ten percent yield.

234
00:10:31,108 --> 00:10:32,407
What's ten percent yield?

235
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:34,306
Cheol Hyeon, take the nice part.

236
00:10:34,307 --> 00:10:35,378
Thank you.

237
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,477
I was going to share it with you, but I crushed it.

238
00:10:37,478 --> 00:10:39,187
It's okay, I can eat this.

239
00:10:39,287 --> 00:10:40,747
Is there some tissue over there?

240
00:10:40,748 --> 00:10:42,816
- Tissue? I'll go get some. - It's okay, I can go.

241
00:10:42,817 --> 00:10:44,557
- I'll go. It's okay. - It's all right.

242
00:10:47,327 --> 00:10:51,028
There were moments that I thought he was overdoing it.

243
00:10:51,957 --> 00:10:53,427
(Glancing)

244
00:10:53,768 --> 00:10:56,398
- Is the rain dropping on you? - No, it's okay.

245
00:10:58,768 --> 00:11:00,967
I was worried about Yun Ha...

246
00:11:00,968 --> 00:11:02,706
feeling a bit overwhelmed,

247
00:11:02,707 --> 00:11:05,107
but I think she found him cute...

248
00:11:05,108 --> 00:11:08,707
and relied on him too.

249
00:11:11,478 --> 00:11:15,186
There are always moments where he cares about those minor stuff.

250
00:11:15,187 --> 00:11:17,888
He does things like that endlessly.

251
00:11:17,988 --> 00:11:20,957
He de-shelled the crab with his hands...

252
00:11:21,057 --> 00:11:24,598
and helped me a lot. He's very sweet.

253
00:11:25,697 --> 00:11:27,196
It's good food to help someone.

254
00:11:27,197 --> 00:11:28,797
Guys, eat crabs.

255
00:11:29,368 --> 00:11:30,467
Crabs or prawns.

256
00:11:30,468 --> 00:11:31,837
- Prawns. Ones with shells. - Yes.

257
00:11:31,898 --> 00:11:34,537
Isn't this place perfect for us?

258
00:11:35,037 --> 00:11:36,577
- Here. - Thank you.

259
00:11:38,207 --> 00:11:40,008
- Wait. - It's okay.

260
00:11:40,207 --> 00:11:41,478
It's okay, I can wash it.

261
00:11:46,618 --> 00:11:47,618
This is so delicious.

262
00:11:48,587 --> 00:11:49,587
Are you happy?

263
00:11:50,087 --> 00:11:51,888
I've never seen you so lively before.

264
00:11:53,057 --> 00:11:54,057
For real.

265
00:11:54,228 --> 00:11:56,727
I think you ate the most today ever since you joined this show.

266
00:11:56,728 --> 00:11:57,997
I'm hyped.

267
00:11:57,998 --> 00:11:59,666
I'm feeling even better because I'm in Singapore.

268
00:11:59,667 --> 00:12:01,827
Yun Ha, your voice became half a key higher.

269
00:12:03,437 --> 00:12:04,498
Me too.

270
00:12:05,098 --> 00:12:07,336
Everyone says I have a middle-low range voice,

271
00:12:07,337 --> 00:12:08,406
but today, I'm speaking...

272
00:12:08,407 --> 00:12:09,478
- High? - in a middle-range voice.

273
00:12:09,807 --> 00:12:10,877
I'm holding myself back...

274
00:12:10,878 --> 00:12:12,748
- from speaking in a high voice. - You're right.

275
00:12:13,778 --> 00:12:16,317
It looks like I put on a crab tint.

276
00:12:17,218 --> 00:12:18,647
- Is it red? - No, it's not.

277
00:12:18,648 --> 00:12:19,917
- Is it not? - No, it's okay.

278
00:12:20,118 --> 00:12:21,218
Tint Number Three.

279
00:12:21,748 --> 00:12:23,587
That's Crab Tint Number Five.

280
00:12:23,718 --> 00:12:26,888
- Number Five? - Yes. You put on a darker colour.

281
00:12:34,327 --> 00:12:36,598
Ji Won's mood changed a bit.

282
00:12:36,768 --> 00:12:38,237
She looked happy and I liked that.

283
00:12:38,238 --> 00:12:39,508
"I want to go around with just her."

284
00:12:40,008 --> 00:12:41,167
I had that thought.

285
00:12:41,667 --> 00:12:43,478
- It tastes like soju. - Really?

286
00:12:44,307 --> 00:12:45,577
Maybe you just want to get drunk.

287
00:12:46,907 --> 00:12:48,008
Because you like the dishes?

288
00:12:52,518 --> 00:12:55,148
- I'm already feeling happy. - It's good.

289
00:12:56,917 --> 00:12:58,388
I'm going to the bathroom.

290
00:12:58,657 --> 00:12:59,888
- See you. - Let me go with you.

291
00:13:00,228 --> 00:13:02,457
(Cheol Hyeon and Yun Jae leave.)

292
00:13:02,598 --> 00:13:04,657
- It's fun. - I know, right?

293
00:13:05,228 --> 00:13:06,368
It's so funny.

294
00:13:06,927 --> 00:13:09,997
Have you talked with all the guys?

295
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:11,997
I have, except Yong Woo.

296
00:13:11,998 --> 00:13:13,207
- Except Yong Woo? - Yes.

297
00:13:13,707 --> 00:13:16,107
When you were matched again with Yun Jae, did you like it?

298
00:13:16,108 --> 00:13:17,807
Since you already had a date with him.

299
00:13:18,008 --> 00:13:20,107
I was just very fascinated.

300
00:13:20,108 --> 00:13:22,217
"How can this happen?"

301
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,317
That was mostly what I felt.

302
00:13:25,047 --> 00:13:27,888
But I don't think he got the chance to meet other women.

303
00:13:28,248 --> 00:13:29,718
But I don't think...

304
00:13:30,087 --> 00:13:32,488
he's curious about the others.

305
00:13:32,858 --> 00:13:36,556
He only has space for one person in his heart.

306
00:13:36,557 --> 00:13:40,397
He can only like one person at a time.

307
00:13:40,398 --> 00:13:41,998
That's really good.

308
00:13:43,268 --> 00:13:45,906
I sometimes think that Yun Jae should go...

309
00:13:45,907 --> 00:13:48,107
and have a date...

310
00:13:48,108 --> 00:13:50,036
with other women too.

311
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:52,576
But Ji Won said that he only had space...

312
00:13:52,577 --> 00:13:55,446
for one person in his heart.

313
00:13:55,447 --> 00:13:57,676
So I thought, "He must be a good person."

314
00:13:57,677 --> 00:14:01,087
Honestly, I got to like him a lot more.

315
00:14:03,118 --> 00:14:05,518
Gosh, Ji Won said...

316
00:14:06,087 --> 00:14:07,887
such a sweet thing.

317
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:09,597
- When Yun Jae's not around, - Of course.

318
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:10,997
- she gives him a leg up. - Of course.

319
00:14:10,998 --> 00:14:13,028
- She's happy. - She is.

320
00:14:13,827 --> 00:14:16,796
Then don't you want to talk with Yong Woo too?

321
00:14:16,797 --> 00:14:19,738
I wanted to. But now,

322
00:14:19,868 --> 00:14:23,076
I'm thinking, "Why bother?"

323
00:14:23,077 --> 00:14:25,378
The person I've never talked with was Jae Hyung.

324
00:14:25,508 --> 00:14:26,508
Do you want to talk with him?

325
00:14:26,509 --> 00:14:28,707
Yes, I want to talk with him.

326
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:32,417
He was busy too, so it wasn't easy.

327
00:14:33,148 --> 00:14:35,817
You don't know what might happen.

328
00:14:35,957 --> 00:14:37,556
Something completely different might happen.

329
00:14:37,557 --> 00:14:39,156
Yes, for real.

330
00:14:39,157 --> 00:14:42,898
There might be variables somewhere.

331
00:14:43,598 --> 00:14:45,497
In Singapore, I want to go...

332
00:14:45,498 --> 00:14:48,267
to Marina Bay Sands and the Ferris wheel.

333
00:14:48,268 --> 00:14:50,067
I want to check that out if I have the chance.

334
00:14:50,368 --> 00:14:53,567
If I could choose, I want to go with Jae Hyung.

335
00:14:57,307 --> 00:14:58,878
Do you think you became close with everyone?

336
00:14:59,207 --> 00:15:01,047
Who did you get close with?

337
00:15:01,348 --> 00:15:02,777
Firstly, you.

338
00:15:02,778 --> 00:15:04,378
I became the closest with you.

339
00:15:04,547 --> 00:15:06,417
Next, Jung Sub?

340
00:15:08,148 --> 00:15:09,717
Compared to the first date,

341
00:15:09,718 --> 00:15:11,416
both of us became more relaxed.

342
00:15:11,417 --> 00:15:14,556
Talking casually made me feel...

343
00:15:14,557 --> 00:15:15,758
that we became close.

344
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:18,956
Actually, I find it difficult to speak casually...

345
00:15:18,957 --> 00:15:20,327
to guys older than me.

346
00:15:20,728 --> 00:15:23,738
But I wanted things to be special with Jae Hyung.

347
00:15:23,898 --> 00:15:26,406
As I spoke casually to him as we had the conversation,

348
00:15:26,407 --> 00:15:28,207
I definitely felt a lot closer to him.

349
00:15:28,907 --> 00:15:31,978
Ju Yeon clearly felt like a younger sister.

350
00:15:32,547 --> 00:15:37,676
Last time, I used to speak formally to her.

351
00:15:37,677 --> 00:15:38,817
Now...

352
00:15:40,248 --> 00:15:43,057
It felt like I was talking with my sister.

353
00:15:43,618 --> 00:15:45,258
Did you get comfortable with Ji Won too?

354
00:15:47,427 --> 00:15:49,697
No. I've barely talked with her.

355
00:15:51,797 --> 00:15:54,997
We did drink beer together at the dining table...

356
00:15:54,998 --> 00:15:56,968
for a short moment twice.

357
00:15:57,638 --> 00:16:00,207
But we've never had a proper conversation.

358
00:16:00,508 --> 00:16:03,077
Now, everyone will stick together...

359
00:16:03,437 --> 00:16:06,008
for the remaining time.

360
00:16:06,248 --> 00:16:08,108
So compared to now,

361
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:11,518
I think something will happen...

362
00:16:12,047 --> 00:16:13,947
- in higher density. - Right.

363
00:16:20,287 --> 00:16:21,826
- It's here. - It's here.

364
00:16:21,827 --> 00:16:22,858
(The 4 of them arrive at the house.)

365
00:16:23,528 --> 00:16:24,528
(Surprised)

366
00:16:24,529 --> 00:16:25,697
It really is this place.

367
00:16:29,937 --> 00:16:31,267
- It's here. - It's here.

368
00:16:31,268 --> 00:16:32,297
(The 4 of them arrive at the house.)

369
00:16:32,968 --> 00:16:34,036
(Surprised)

370
00:16:34,037 --> 00:16:35,207
It really is this place.

371
00:16:40,608 --> 00:16:42,817
- It's so pretty. - Gosh, it's so pretty.

372
00:16:43,577 --> 00:16:44,618
- This is insane. - Gosh.

373
00:17:13,478 --> 00:17:14,607
It's so good.

374
00:17:17,847 --> 00:17:19,188
It's so pretty.

375
00:17:20,387 --> 00:17:21,488
What's this?

376
00:17:22,857 --> 00:17:23,958
This is crazy.

377
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:25,688
Isn't this crazy?

378
00:17:27,428 --> 00:17:28,627
- What's this? - Gosh.

379
00:17:33,228 --> 00:17:35,367
(A kitchen on the 1st floor)

380
00:17:40,508 --> 00:17:42,136
How's my house? Is it pretty?

381
00:17:42,137 --> 00:17:43,137
(When you follow the hallway beside the kitchen...)

382
00:17:44,037 --> 00:17:45,478
(A living room on the 1st floor)

383
00:17:48,107 --> 00:17:49,147
(Amazed)

384
00:17:54,718 --> 00:17:56,188
(A terrace and a swimming pool on the 1st floor)

385
00:18:01,158 --> 00:18:03,057
I'll probably swim here every day.

386
00:18:03,198 --> 00:18:05,158
(Preview)

387
00:18:16,607 --> 00:18:18,536
- I saw it from outside. - Right?

388
00:18:18,537 --> 00:18:19,747
Was there a path to go out from here?

389
00:18:19,748 --> 00:18:20,908
Yes.

390
00:18:21,647 --> 00:18:23,347
It's so pretty.

391
00:18:26,248 --> 00:18:28,317
(Behind the house...)

392
00:18:30,658 --> 00:18:33,087
(is a cosy backyard that will light up the night.)

393
00:18:48,938 --> 00:18:50,008
Everyone.

394
00:18:50,678 --> 00:18:52,646
To those that arrived first.

395
00:18:52,647 --> 00:18:54,248
(She spots the letter on the table.)

396
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:56,248
- Let's open it. - Let's open it.

397
00:18:56,678 --> 00:18:57,748
I can't wait to find out.

398
00:18:58,918 --> 00:19:00,087
I see a lot of words.

399
00:19:02,617 --> 00:19:04,587
"Welcome to Singapore."

400
00:19:04,688 --> 00:19:07,287
"In Singapore, siblings will share a room."

401
00:19:08,488 --> 00:19:09,557
(Confused)

402
00:19:09,897 --> 00:19:12,297
"The room is allocated on a first-come, first-serve basis."

403
00:19:15,468 --> 00:19:18,066
"The siblings need to enter the room..."

404
00:19:18,067 --> 00:19:20,737
"and lie on a bed each..."

405
00:19:20,738 --> 00:19:22,777
"to secure the room first."

406
00:19:22,778 --> 00:19:25,238
You two are already here.

407
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:27,248
Shall we go and pick our room?

408
00:19:29,317 --> 00:19:30,317
Come here.

409
00:19:31,547 --> 00:19:34,046
Finally, my brother and I have the chance...

410
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:37,417
to get along well and choose something together.

411
00:19:37,418 --> 00:19:39,357
I was very happy at that thought.

412
00:19:39,627 --> 00:19:41,028
They're very lucky.

413
00:19:41,557 --> 00:19:44,957
In terms of choosing the room,

414
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:46,528
Ji Won and Yun Jae were the true winners.

415
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:48,768
I was so envious.

416
00:19:49,028 --> 00:19:50,067
Wear your sunglasses.

417
00:19:50,268 --> 00:19:52,198
(They start to check the rooms.)

418
00:19:52,337 --> 00:19:54,438
It's really good for us.

419
00:19:55,508 --> 00:19:57,336
But it's bad if Jung Sub comes back late, right?

420
00:19:57,337 --> 00:19:58,777
- Jung Sub will come back late. - But I'll lie down on both beds.

421
00:19:58,778 --> 00:20:00,377
I'll lie down on both beds.

422
00:20:01,178 --> 00:20:02,616
Put your stuff on it as if Jung Sub was here.

423
00:20:02,617 --> 00:20:03,617
Firstly...

424
00:20:04,547 --> 00:20:08,487
(The house has 5 rooms.)

425
00:20:08,488 --> 00:20:12,517
(There are 3 rooms on the 2nd floor with a hallway in the middle.)

426
00:20:12,518 --> 00:20:16,427
(The 1st room on the 2nd floor)

427
00:20:16,428 --> 00:20:20,396
(The 2nd room on the 2nd floor)

428
00:20:20,397 --> 00:20:23,738
(The 3rd room on the 2nd floor)

429
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:28,107
(The 3rd floor has 2 rooms too.)

430
00:20:29,008 --> 00:20:31,907
(The 1st room on the 3rd floor)

431
00:20:31,908 --> 00:20:34,478
(The 2nd room on the 3rd floor)

432
00:20:34,778 --> 00:20:37,778
(The 5 rooms are all different.)

433
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:44,057
(All the 5 rooms have different conditions.)

434
00:20:44,918 --> 00:20:48,488
(They will choose the rooms strictly 1st come, 1st served.)

435
00:20:52,428 --> 00:20:53,698
- It's... Gosh. - Which one should we choose?

436
00:20:54,067 --> 00:20:55,998
- Gosh, this room looks nice. - This one?

437
00:20:56,897 --> 00:20:58,168
Gosh. This place looks amazing!

438
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:01,307
(Room 1 on the 2nd floor)

439
00:21:03,337 --> 00:21:04,438
This room has an en suite bathroom.

440
00:21:04,778 --> 00:21:05,908
- It has a terrace too. - A terrace.

441
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:09,616
(It comes with a small terrace.)

442
00:21:09,617 --> 00:21:10,717
- Okay. - This is it.

443
00:21:10,718 --> 00:21:12,917
- This is it. - I think this is the main room.

444
00:21:12,918 --> 00:21:13,918
- This is it. - I like it.

445
00:21:14,317 --> 00:21:16,687
Gosh, come on. Come home quickly, Jung Sub.

446
00:21:16,688 --> 00:21:17,718
Let's pick.

447
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:20,188
- Not this room. - Not this room.

448
00:21:20,928 --> 00:21:23,797
(No one wants Room 3 on the 2nd floor.)

449
00:21:24,127 --> 00:21:25,497
- This is the second-best room. - This room...

450
00:21:25,498 --> 00:21:26,566
- I see. - This room looks nice too.

451
00:21:26,567 --> 00:21:27,866
- I like this room. - This room...

452
00:21:27,867 --> 00:21:30,337
- This room has a beautiful view. - This is...

453
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:31,836
I love this room.

454
00:21:31,837 --> 00:21:33,167
(The room has a terrace that overlooks the backyard...)

455
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:35,408
(and small, cute sofas.)

456
00:21:36,377 --> 00:21:37,978
This room is the main room.

457
00:21:38,537 --> 00:21:41,007
- This room is the prettiest. - Jung Sub, come home already.

458
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,546
(Room 2 on the 2nd floor even has a walk-in closet.)

459
00:21:42,547 --> 00:21:43,877
Gosh, there's a walk-in closet.

460
00:21:47,988 --> 00:21:49,988
Gosh, this room has to be the best.

461
00:21:50,218 --> 00:21:52,617
- This room is the biggest so far. - Really?

462
00:21:52,857 --> 00:21:54,327
This room is really nice.

463
00:21:57,528 --> 00:21:59,327
This room is nice too.

464
00:22:01,168 --> 00:22:02,468
(Room 1 on the 3rd floor)

465
00:22:07,137 --> 00:22:09,137
(This room has the biggest terrace.)

466
00:22:10,337 --> 00:22:12,778
(It has a view of the backyard.)

467
00:22:13,107 --> 00:22:14,346
I want to use this room with my sister.

468
00:22:14,347 --> 00:22:16,617
- That's a yoga room. - There are yoga mats here.

469
00:22:16,748 --> 00:22:19,346
I first tried to find a room my sister would like.

470
00:22:19,347 --> 00:22:21,187
When I saw the yoga mats in the room on the third floor,

471
00:22:21,188 --> 00:22:23,487
I thought it would be nice to use the room with my sister.

472
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:27,227
Each room had clear pros and cons.

473
00:22:27,228 --> 00:22:29,797
The rooms were so beautiful.

474
00:22:29,897 --> 00:22:32,866
In my opinion, there were a few great rooms.

475
00:22:32,867 --> 00:22:34,566
But he was so clueless about this.

476
00:22:34,567 --> 00:22:38,066
He was probably feeling excited that he was in Singapore...

477
00:22:38,067 --> 00:22:41,738
and enjoying his lovely date with Se Seung.

478
00:22:41,938 --> 00:22:43,708
But he had to come home quickly.

479
00:22:44,008 --> 00:22:45,908
- There were only four rooms, right? - No?

480
00:22:46,178 --> 00:22:47,178
There must be one more room.

481
00:22:47,179 --> 00:22:48,876
Is the last room on the first floor?

482
00:22:48,877 --> 00:22:50,248
It must be on the first floor then.

483
00:22:52,518 --> 00:22:53,787
Ji Won, the bathroom is here.

484
00:22:54,117 --> 00:22:55,347
There's no bathroom here.

485
00:22:56,188 --> 00:22:57,458
This room is out.

486
00:22:57,817 --> 00:22:59,387
Right. There's no en suite bathroom. So it's out.

487
00:22:59,658 --> 00:23:01,458
There must be a secret room somewhere.

488
00:23:02,287 --> 00:23:05,698
Wait. There must be one more room downstairs.

489
00:23:05,928 --> 00:23:07,228
It must be somewhere here.

490
00:23:08,097 --> 00:23:09,897
- I don't see it. - Downstairs.

491
00:23:10,067 --> 00:23:11,498
- Will some of us sleep outdoors? - Downstairs.

492
00:23:12,238 --> 00:23:13,268
I don't see it.

493
00:23:13,938 --> 00:23:15,336
There are only four rooms?

494
00:23:15,337 --> 00:23:17,077
Wait. So there won't be a room for a pair of siblings?

495
00:23:17,408 --> 00:23:18,408
That's possible.

(Episode 11: Siblings' Room)

508
00:24:43,097 --> 00:24:44,297
I think we got a text message.

509
00:24:49,837 --> 00:24:51,997
(If you extend the date, your date will continue at a different spot.)

510
00:24:51,998 --> 00:24:54,167
(If you don't extend it, you will go to the lodging.)

511
00:24:54,168 --> 00:24:59,438
(Will you extend the date? But you cannot discuss it.)

512
00:25:02,448 --> 00:25:05,147
(Both of them must request to extend the date...)

513
00:25:05,748 --> 00:25:08,247
(in order for the date to continue.)

514
00:25:08,248 --> 00:25:09,248
- Oh, this. - I see.

515
00:25:10,857 --> 00:25:12,356
- Wait. - I love stuff like this.

516
00:25:12,357 --> 00:25:13,857
- They can't discuss it? - I love it.

517
00:25:14,188 --> 00:25:15,227
- This is so cruel. - Hurry.

518
00:25:15,228 --> 00:25:17,556
They're in front of each other. Why can't they discuss it?

519
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:18,557
Seriously.

520
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:20,497
- They're already feeling awkward. - Gosh, this...

521
00:25:20,498 --> 00:25:21,927
But since they're together right now,

522
00:25:21,928 --> 00:25:23,667
wouldn't they easily choose to extend it?

523
00:25:23,668 --> 00:25:25,468
MIYEON isn't afraid to speak up now.

524
00:25:26,408 --> 00:25:28,768
- It's like she took over my role. - A lot...

525
00:25:29,468 --> 00:25:30,908
A lot has happened.

526
00:25:31,607 --> 00:25:33,407
But if both of them don't extend it, it will be disappointing.

527
00:25:33,408 --> 00:25:34,978
- Right. It will be over then. - Right?

528
00:25:35,877 --> 00:25:36,948
Hurry. Come on.

529
00:25:50,728 --> 00:25:56,297
(Your date has been extended.)

530
00:25:58,897 --> 00:25:59,938
Where should we go?

531
00:26:00,168 --> 00:26:01,207
I wanted to talk to her more...

532
00:26:01,208 --> 00:26:03,077
- Us? - after extending the date.

533
00:26:03,678 --> 00:26:06,007
I wanted to take this time to get to know her more.

534
00:26:06,008 --> 00:26:10,018
I also wanted to take this time to get to know about my feelings.

535
00:26:13,018 --> 00:26:14,417
- Should we take a picture here? - Let's do that.

536
00:26:14,418 --> 00:26:16,188
What do you think? I think this is perfect.

537
00:26:26,468 --> 00:26:27,468
- Good. - I like it.

538
00:26:27,468 --> 00:26:28,468
Good. Nice.

- This is beautiful. It's crazy. - Yes.

540
00:26:30,637 --> 00:26:32,896
Let me take a picture of you with the background.

541
00:26:32,897 --> 00:26:33,908
With this?

542
00:26:34,738 --> 00:26:35,938
That spot looks amazing.

543
00:26:37,107 --> 00:26:38,137
You look great.

544
00:26:40,448 --> 00:26:41,678
It suits you.

545
00:26:42,708 --> 00:26:44,218
- Do I look like a local? - Yes.

546
00:26:46,418 --> 00:26:47,687
This is really nice.

547
00:26:47,688 --> 00:26:49,787
- Right. It's beautiful. - I love it.

548
00:26:52,958 --> 00:26:54,487
- Right. One more time. - We...

549
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:56,257
- Do you know what I almost said? - What?

550
00:26:56,258 --> 00:26:57,928
"It feels like we're travelling abroad."

551
00:26:59,127 --> 00:27:01,367
Right. When did Seoul change so much?

552
00:27:02,028 --> 00:27:03,238
Are we in Busan?

553
00:27:03,537 --> 00:27:04,938
- Should we take a video? - Yes.

554
00:27:08,738 --> 00:27:10,208
Where are we right now?

555
00:27:10,678 --> 00:27:12,707
- Singapore. - Singapore.

556
00:27:12,708 --> 00:27:13,806
Yes, we're in Singapore.

557
00:27:13,807 --> 00:27:15,677
So you're not shy to speak up now?

558
00:27:15,678 --> 00:27:17,377
Right. Here's the Marina Bay Sands.

559
00:27:17,978 --> 00:27:19,178
We just had dinner.

560
00:27:29,627 --> 00:27:32,297
- Should I take a picture of you? - No, I'm shy.

561
00:27:34,198 --> 00:27:35,998
I've got a nice camerawoman.

562
00:27:36,268 --> 00:27:37,296
- Right? - Yes.

563
00:27:37,297 --> 00:27:39,238
She won't take pictures of herself. She only takes pictures of me.

564
00:27:40,938 --> 00:27:43,076
But I'll regret not taking pictures later.

565
00:27:43,077 --> 00:27:44,077
- Right. - Yes.

566
00:27:44,778 --> 00:27:45,937
- So... - Take a picture of me later...

567
00:27:45,938 --> 00:27:47,847
- when we get on a boat. - Sure.

568
00:27:51,948 --> 00:27:56,147
(The two of them receive a message.)

569
00:27:56,817 --> 00:27:59,418
(Will you extend the date? But you cannot discuss it.)

570
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:04,327
To be honest, I was really worried.

571
00:28:04,728 --> 00:28:08,367
That moment felt like ten years for me.

572
00:28:08,897 --> 00:28:10,168
That one minute.

573
00:28:10,567 --> 00:28:12,837
I had a feeling that Ju Yeon would extend the date.

574
00:28:13,367 --> 00:28:16,977
But if I don't extend the date, the date will be stopped...

575
00:28:16,978 --> 00:28:18,178
and we'll have to go back.

576
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:20,647
So I started to think about what to do.

577
00:28:27,918 --> 00:28:30,556
(Jae Hyung finishes sending the message first.)

578
00:28:30,557 --> 00:28:32,857
(She hasn't sent the message yet.)

579
00:28:33,228 --> 00:28:36,958
Jae Hyung is really good at keeping a straight face.

580
00:28:37,127 --> 00:28:40,367
So I can't figure out what he's thinking.

581
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:43,597
But since I decided to stay true to my feelings...

582
00:28:44,067 --> 00:28:46,097
before coming on this trip,

583
00:28:46,438 --> 00:28:48,238
I said I wanted to extend it.

584
00:28:51,307 --> 00:28:53,647
(Ju Yeon can't put down her phone.)

585
00:29:02,218 --> 00:29:03,688
(Smiling)

586
00:29:08,658 --> 00:29:11,258
(The date has been extended.)

587
00:29:12,498 --> 00:29:13,767
(Well...)

588
00:29:13,768 --> 00:29:14,797
I was relieved.

589
00:29:15,198 --> 00:29:18,768
I thought that he didn't hate spending time with me...

590
00:29:19,238 --> 00:29:22,468
because he wanted to continue our date.

591
00:29:22,768 --> 00:29:24,408
I thought I should extend it.

592
00:29:25,408 --> 00:29:28,508
Actually, I would have extended the date with everyone, though.

593
00:29:28,877 --> 00:29:31,517
It was my first chance to extend the date.

594
00:29:31,518 --> 00:29:34,046
I thought that I could totally go to a different spot...

595
00:29:34,047 --> 00:29:35,787
and enjoy our time together.

596
00:29:36,047 --> 00:29:37,617
I wonder where we'll go.

597
00:29:38,188 --> 00:29:40,428
I want to go to a fun place.

598
00:29:41,188 --> 00:29:42,488
We should overcome the rainstorm...

599
00:29:43,397 --> 00:29:45,096
and head to the night sea.

600
00:29:45,097 --> 00:29:46,097
Sounds good.

601
00:29:46,397 --> 00:29:48,067
- Who knows? - Dive into the eye of the storm.

602
00:29:48,168 --> 00:29:50,998
After the extension, the mood between us changed.

603
00:29:51,297 --> 00:29:53,708
After confirming that we both wanted to extend the date,

604
00:29:54,438 --> 00:29:57,408
we were excited and friendly toward each other all of a sudden.

605
00:29:57,938 --> 00:30:00,106
- Shall we go? - Shall we?

606
00:30:00,107 --> 00:30:01,107
Let's go.

607
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:09,188
(Will you extend the date? But you cannot discuss it.)

608
00:30:12,918 --> 00:30:14,587
- There they are. - I'm curious about them the most.

609
00:30:15,428 --> 00:30:17,197
- It was only for a moment. - Jung Sub.

610
00:30:17,198 --> 00:30:19,257
- But it made me so nervous. - Se Seung will say no right away.

611
00:30:19,258 --> 00:30:20,428
Look at her face.

612
00:30:21,367 --> 00:30:24,067
(I'll extend it.)

613
00:30:25,097 --> 00:30:26,708
I requested to extend it right away.

614
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:28,967
I wasn't certain...

615
00:30:28,968 --> 00:30:33,077
if Se Seung would extend the date or not.

616
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:39,748
I was quite confused about my feelings.

617
00:30:40,617 --> 00:30:41,817
I thought a lot about this.

618
00:30:42,817 --> 00:30:44,887
(I'll extend it.)

619
00:30:47,158 --> 00:30:48,528
But... I don't know.

620
00:30:48,758 --> 00:30:53,728
I didn't want to end our date at the first location.

621
00:30:54,168 --> 00:30:55,297
So I extended it.

622
00:30:56,938 --> 00:31:00,438
(Their date is extended.)

623
00:31:04,978 --> 00:31:06,177
This room is the biggest.

624
00:31:06,178 --> 00:31:07,207
(The house in Singapore)

625
00:31:07,208 --> 00:31:08,248
Let's go!

626
00:31:08,347 --> 00:31:09,507
Isn't this the best room?

627
00:31:09,508 --> 00:31:10,978
(Yun Jae and Ji Won are looking for a spot to lie down.)

628
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:12,876
- That room... - Hey, we should strategise.

629
00:31:12,877 --> 00:31:13,886
What?

630
00:31:13,887 --> 00:31:15,487
We should hide the pink message card.

631
00:31:15,488 --> 00:31:17,957
Then we should bring our sibling to the room.

632
00:31:17,958 --> 00:31:20,457
Let's do that. Let's hide it quickly.

633
00:31:20,458 --> 00:31:22,086
- Right. - I want this room then.

634
00:31:22,087 --> 00:31:23,087
This room?

635
00:31:23,088 --> 00:31:24,597
- I want to take this room. - Use it then.

636
00:31:25,327 --> 00:31:26,458
(Clearing her throat)

637
00:31:27,397 --> 00:31:28,968
- Lie down. - Let's lie down.

638
00:31:29,498 --> 00:31:31,067
- Gosh. - Lie down.

639
00:31:31,337 --> 00:31:32,597
- Did you decide on this room then? - Yes.

640
00:31:33,438 --> 00:31:34,567
- Is this your decision? - Yes.

641
00:31:35,337 --> 00:31:37,508
- Then I'll go that way. - Is this room better?

642
00:31:38,008 --> 00:31:39,737
Come on. Choose between 1 of these 2 rooms already.

643
00:31:39,738 --> 00:31:40,908
Why are you rushing me?

644
00:31:41,047 --> 00:31:42,146
Isn't this room better?

645
00:31:42,147 --> 00:31:44,076
But I'm happy with both rooms. So I'm good.

646
00:31:44,077 --> 00:31:46,547
(They come back to Room 1 on the 2nd floor.)

647
00:31:47,787 --> 00:31:49,188
I think this room is good too.

648
00:31:49,647 --> 00:31:51,188
Well, we'll have to pick.

649
00:31:52,387 --> 00:31:53,428
Did you pick one?

650
00:31:53,627 --> 00:31:55,428
Isn't the room upstairs the biggest?

651
00:31:55,658 --> 00:31:57,227
Size-wise, it's the biggest room.

652
00:31:57,228 --> 00:31:58,896
Maybe, two teams might share that room.

653
00:31:58,897 --> 00:32:00,027
Right. I think so.

654
00:32:00,028 --> 00:32:02,097
- Two teams might share that room. - Outdoors?

655
00:32:03,198 --> 00:32:04,467
But today...

656
00:32:04,468 --> 00:32:09,137
(Your sibling extended his date.)

657
00:32:11,807 --> 00:32:13,908
(What do you mean?)

658
00:32:15,307 --> 00:32:17,247
(If your sibling comes home late because his date is extended,)

659
00:32:17,248 --> 00:32:18,978
(you will get to pick your room in a subsequent order.)

660
00:32:19,877 --> 00:32:21,317
This brat.

661
00:32:21,918 --> 00:32:23,687
He extended his date.

662
00:32:23,688 --> 00:32:27,658
I was getting really impatient.

663
00:32:28,688 --> 00:32:30,258
I thought, "I'll have to pick last."

664
00:32:31,827 --> 00:32:33,797
- She's doomed. - Seriously.

665
00:32:33,928 --> 00:32:35,428
Don't wait for him.

666
00:32:35,698 --> 00:32:37,268
He has no idea that the rooms are being chosen.

667
00:32:37,867 --> 00:32:39,396
- It's pretty far. - Won't Ju Yeon and Yong Woo...

668
00:32:39,397 --> 00:32:40,637
pick last?

669
00:32:40,807 --> 00:32:42,238
Everyone will get to pick last.

670
00:32:42,438 --> 00:32:43,837
They might come to the lodging around the same time.

671
00:32:44,478 --> 00:32:46,307
- Hey, this bed feels dry and soft. - Here?

672
00:32:46,637 --> 00:32:47,948
- Should we pick this room? - It's close to the door too.

673
00:32:48,278 --> 00:32:49,278
Let's pick this one.

674
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:50,677
But... Come back.

675
00:32:50,678 --> 00:32:51,977
(They will reconsider.)

676
00:32:51,978 --> 00:32:53,247
Seriously.

677
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:55,117
- What? - This room has a nice vibe.

678
00:32:55,317 --> 00:32:56,518
We have a full-length mirror here.

679
00:32:56,817 --> 00:32:58,718
Right. This is too good to give up either.

680
00:33:00,387 --> 00:33:02,488
- We can't sit here for a long time. - Really?

681
00:33:02,728 --> 00:33:04,897
- I think this is new. - Hey, let them have this room.

682
00:33:05,127 --> 00:33:06,127
- Let's go over there. - No.

683
00:33:06,127 --> 00:33:07,127
- Let's go there. - Yes.

684
00:33:07,128 --> 00:33:08,297
- It's all yours. - It's yours, Yun Ha.

685
00:33:08,668 --> 00:33:09,668
Bye.

686
00:33:09,669 --> 00:33:11,498
I can pick this room when he gets here.

687
00:33:12,037 --> 00:33:13,467
- This is the room for us. - This is it.

688
00:33:13,468 --> 00:33:15,067
- It's nice and dry. - That room is nice.

689
00:33:15,208 --> 00:33:17,537
When I lay down here, it was nice and soft.

690
00:33:18,107 --> 00:33:19,508
- We can't be too greedy. - Yes.

691
00:33:19,877 --> 00:33:21,207
- It's best to be close to the door. - Yes.

692
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:22,778
All right. We chose a good one.

693
00:33:23,778 --> 00:33:26,816
We were trying to decide between two rooms.

694
00:33:26,817 --> 00:33:30,287
I think we chose a cosier room between the two.

695
00:33:30,387 --> 00:33:34,357
And from what I noticed, there was a better room.

696
00:33:34,528 --> 00:33:38,158
But it seemed he wanted Yun Ha to take it. That's how I felt.

697
00:33:38,557 --> 00:33:40,728
To a woman he likes,

698
00:33:41,127 --> 00:33:44,566
he's endlessly considerate and thoughtful.

699
00:33:44,567 --> 00:33:47,667
I think he thinks a lot about what he can do...

700
00:33:47,668 --> 00:33:49,238
to make things better for her.

701
00:33:49,508 --> 00:33:50,636
- Yun Jae. - Yes?

702
00:33:50,637 --> 00:33:52,207
Since we lay down here, it's ours. Right?

703
00:33:52,208 --> 00:33:54,077
- Yes. - Do we have to stay in bed?

704
00:33:54,607 --> 00:33:55,778
Well, we can do that then.

705
00:33:55,877 --> 00:33:57,546
When we looked at the two rooms,

706
00:33:57,547 --> 00:33:59,476
one of them was clearly better.

707
00:33:59,477 --> 00:34:03,217
In my head, I wanted Yun Ha to take the better room.

708
00:34:03,218 --> 00:34:05,587
But I had to listen to Ji Won's opinion.

709
00:34:05,817 --> 00:34:08,457
Ji Won chose the second-best room when we had to decide.

710
00:34:08,658 --> 00:34:10,928
I thought to myself that everything all worked out.

711
00:34:11,198 --> 00:34:12,797
I was very happy.

712
00:34:16,167 --> 00:34:17,368
So she was right.

713
00:34:17,567 --> 00:34:18,598
She's so sharp.

714
00:34:19,238 --> 00:34:21,566
Ji Won is really sharp at noticing things like this.

715
00:34:21,567 --> 00:34:22,606
- Right. - She's really good...

716
00:34:22,607 --> 00:34:23,637
- at reading his feelings. - Yes.

717
00:34:23,638 --> 00:34:24,807
She is quick indeed.

718
00:34:24,808 --> 00:34:26,407
Her sharpness is amazing. Seriously.

719
00:34:26,408 --> 00:34:27,808
- She's helping her brother. - Yes.

720
00:34:29,147 --> 00:34:30,876
How could she notice all these things about him?

721
00:34:30,877 --> 00:34:31,877
That's amazing.

722
00:34:31,878 --> 00:34:33,888
So she must be very sensitive about noticing his feelings.

723
00:34:34,948 --> 00:34:36,746
(Se Seung and Jung Sub at a wine bar)

724
00:34:36,747 --> 00:34:37,957
- This is the place. - Wine?

725
00:34:40,528 --> 00:34:41,658
- Welcome. - Hello.

726
00:34:43,288 --> 00:34:44,357
This is nice.

727
00:34:48,968 --> 00:34:50,067
Let's clink our glasses first.

728
00:34:50,667 --> 00:34:51,667
- Cheers. - Cheers.

729
00:34:51,937 --> 00:34:53,397
To having a great time on our first day in Singapore.

730
00:34:53,767 --> 00:34:55,538
To our first day in Singapore.

731
00:34:57,078 --> 00:34:58,337
I love this wine.

732
00:35:00,138 --> 00:35:01,207
Let's drink together.

733
00:35:06,047 --> 00:35:08,147
How many dates have we been together so far?

734
00:35:08,448 --> 00:35:09,448
Is this our third date?

735
00:35:09,747 --> 00:35:10,888
- Our date? - Yes.

736
00:35:11,517 --> 00:35:13,388
- It's only been our third date. - Right?

737
00:35:13,687 --> 00:35:16,957
But every single date we went on was quite...

738
00:35:17,558 --> 00:35:19,197
- Did it leave a strong impression? - Yes. It did.

739
00:35:19,198 --> 00:35:20,597
Our dates had depth.

740
00:35:20,598 --> 00:35:22,497
So the date was of different quality.

741
00:35:23,968 --> 00:35:26,198
I went over the dates in my head one more time...

742
00:35:26,437 --> 00:35:28,468
when we went back to the house or before I went to sleep.

743
00:35:28,607 --> 00:35:31,707
My dates with you were the only dates...

744
00:35:32,138 --> 00:35:34,408
that made me happy at the end of the day.

745
00:35:46,357 --> 00:35:47,828
What was that?

746
00:35:49,127 --> 00:35:51,028
- She's feeling better now. - Seriously.

747
00:35:51,558 --> 00:35:54,267
I like that it doesn't take long for Se Seung to move on.

748
00:35:54,497 --> 00:35:55,626
I think Se Seung feels better...

749
00:35:55,627 --> 00:35:57,537
when he tells her the things she wants to hear.

750
00:35:57,538 --> 00:35:58,737
- I think so. - Of course.

751
00:35:58,738 --> 00:36:00,637
That's why it's important to say the right things.

752
00:36:00,638 --> 00:36:01,908
Things they want to hear.

753
00:36:02,167 --> 00:36:03,308
- How do you know what they are? - Right.

754
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:05,907
You can just say things you want to hear from that person.

755
00:36:05,908 --> 00:36:06,908
- Of course. - Right.

756
00:36:06,909 --> 00:36:08,678
When you like someone, you're bound to know what they are.

757
00:36:11,448 --> 00:36:13,546
Was there a person you wanted...

758
00:36:13,547 --> 00:36:16,848
to go on a date with for the Ring-ring Date?

759
00:36:17,817 --> 00:36:18,888
Me? You.

760
00:36:20,488 --> 00:36:22,086
I would be lying if I said...

761
00:36:22,087 --> 00:36:24,296
I wasn't interested in getting to know other people.

762
00:36:24,297 --> 00:36:25,427
Right.

763
00:36:25,428 --> 00:36:27,198
- Well, I felt the same way. - But...

764
00:36:27,567 --> 00:36:31,667
when I thought about you going on a date with another woman,

765
00:36:31,937 --> 00:36:33,638
I didn't feel that great.

766
00:36:34,207 --> 00:36:36,468
Why is that? Really?

767
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:39,936
So I knew there was a slim chance that you and I would be paired.

768
00:36:39,937 --> 00:36:41,308
But I still wanted it to be you.

769
00:36:41,808 --> 00:36:42,908
That's fascinating.

770
00:36:43,718 --> 00:36:45,348
Were you interested in other people too?

771
00:36:45,778 --> 00:36:46,778
Yes.

772
00:36:46,779 --> 00:36:47,917
- Is that so? - Yes.

773
00:36:50,118 --> 00:36:51,187
Look at this guy.

774
00:36:51,957 --> 00:36:52,988
What?

775
00:36:53,317 --> 00:36:54,828
Whom did you want to get to know?

776
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:56,488
Back then, it was her.

777
00:36:56,658 --> 00:36:57,996
- Who? Cho A? - Yes.

778
00:36:57,997 --> 00:36:59,258
- Really? - Yes.

779
00:37:03,528 --> 00:37:05,336
That's why it hurt you a lot when you didn't get a message...

780
00:37:05,337 --> 00:37:07,008
from her after your date with her.

781
00:37:08,738 --> 00:37:11,177
- Oh, after that date? - Yes.

782
00:37:11,178 --> 00:37:12,307
Yes. It hurt me a lot. Why?

783
00:37:12,308 --> 00:37:13,376
- I see. - Was that obvious?

784
00:37:13,377 --> 00:37:15,677
- You said it hurt you a lot. - Because I said so?

785
00:37:15,678 --> 00:37:17,178
Yes. Right. That's why it hurt me a lot.

786
00:37:17,477 --> 00:37:19,476
You wanted to get to know her more.

787
00:37:19,477 --> 00:37:21,186
So after going on the date, you were happy with it.

788
00:37:21,187 --> 00:37:23,218
But she didn't feel the same way. Right?

789
00:37:25,587 --> 00:37:26,587
Yes.

790
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:31,198
I was completely in the dark about what happened.

791
00:37:31,428 --> 00:37:33,258
He was interested in Cho A.

792
00:37:33,497 --> 00:37:35,226
So he did his best on the date.

793
00:37:35,227 --> 00:37:37,766
But he didn't get the message from her, so it hurt him a lot.

794
00:37:37,767 --> 00:37:38,767
That's what had happened.

795
00:37:38,768 --> 00:37:40,538
I was slightly conflicted.

796
00:37:42,067 --> 00:37:44,977
Here's how I felt. From the beginning,

797
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:49,377
you told me a lot of things that gave me a sense of certainty.

798
00:37:49,808 --> 00:37:52,147
So I thought it was quite risky.

799
00:37:52,647 --> 00:37:53,647
What?

800
00:37:54,388 --> 00:37:55,617
What do you mean?

801
00:37:55,618 --> 00:37:57,356
Given that it was only our first date,

802
00:37:57,357 --> 00:37:59,687
I thought you expressed your feelings too openly.

803
00:38:00,058 --> 00:38:01,457
- I expressed too openly? - Yes.

804
00:38:01,888 --> 00:38:02,928
Go on.

805
00:38:06,627 --> 00:38:09,226
So I thought, "Can he do this?"

806
00:38:09,227 --> 00:38:11,697
- That crossed my mind. - That crossed your mind?

807
00:38:11,698 --> 00:38:12,937
Not at all.

808
00:38:13,767 --> 00:38:16,638
Then you must have expressed more than you were actually feeling.

809
00:38:17,477 --> 00:38:18,507
- That's possible. - So you weren't sure...

810
00:38:18,508 --> 00:38:19,578
about me at first?

811
00:38:21,408 --> 00:38:23,007
Then were you sure about me at first?

812
00:38:23,008 --> 00:38:24,677
- No, I wasn't. - Right. Same here.

813
00:38:24,678 --> 00:38:25,976
- I was getting to know you. - But...

814
00:38:25,977 --> 00:38:28,016
But you made it sound like you were.

815
00:38:28,017 --> 00:38:29,247
That's what you think.

816
00:38:31,317 --> 00:38:32,317
That was so bold.

817
00:38:32,817 --> 00:38:34,387
Then were you sure about me at first?

818
00:38:34,388 --> 00:38:36,086
- No, I wasn't. - Right. Same here.

819
00:38:36,087 --> 00:38:37,296
- I was getting to know you. - But...

820
00:38:37,297 --> 00:38:39,527
But you made it sound like you were.

821
00:38:39,528 --> 00:38:40,767
That's what you think.

822
00:38:42,897 --> 00:38:44,167
That was so bold. I actually like that.

823
00:38:44,368 --> 00:38:45,697
- It's better to be brutally honest. - Gosh. Look at his face.

824
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:46,936
- No. - "That's what you think."

825
00:38:46,937 --> 00:38:49,067
Se Seung is right. That's how he behaved around her.

826
00:38:49,238 --> 00:38:50,307
- Right. He behaved like that. - Right.

827
00:38:50,308 --> 00:38:52,237
- But what he said to her... - I see. This...

828
00:38:52,238 --> 00:38:53,947
"That's what you think."

829
00:38:53,948 --> 00:38:56,246
When Se Seung wanted to get to know other people...

830
00:38:56,247 --> 00:38:59,077
and when he noticed that, he was clearly upset.

831
00:38:59,078 --> 00:39:01,447
- Right. He was jealous. - Right.

832
00:39:01,448 --> 00:39:02,947
On top of that,

833
00:39:02,948 --> 00:39:05,157
he openly expressed to let her know that he was interested in her.

834
00:39:05,158 --> 00:39:06,316
- He openly expressed that. - He did.

835
00:39:06,317 --> 00:39:08,788
- Jung Sub, shall we count them? - Right.

836
00:39:09,587 --> 00:39:12,057
I think he's feeling frustrated...

837
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:14,626
because he feels that Se Seung is being aggressive.

838
00:39:14,627 --> 00:39:17,027
- He thinks it's suffocating. - Right.

839
00:39:17,028 --> 00:39:18,666
- It's the situation. - Because he feels it's suffocating,

840
00:39:18,667 --> 00:39:20,066
he's starting to sound quite harsh.

841
00:39:20,067 --> 00:39:21,967
- It's suffocating me too. - Right.

842
00:39:21,968 --> 00:39:23,537
- It's... - Try to exhale.

843
00:39:23,538 --> 00:39:24,538
(Exhaling)

844
00:39:25,238 --> 00:39:26,238
(Inhaling and exhaling)

845
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:27,347
- I feel the same way. - But the thing is,

846
00:39:27,348 --> 00:39:29,677
Se Seung really likes Jung Sub.

847
00:39:29,678 --> 00:39:31,646
- She wants to confirm his feelings. - Right.

848
00:39:31,647 --> 00:39:33,247
- She's impatient. - So she's being aggressive.

849
00:39:34,348 --> 00:39:37,187
Seriously. They keep going back and forth between hot and cold.

850
00:39:38,817 --> 00:39:40,356
Then were you sure about me at first?

851
00:39:40,357 --> 00:39:42,086
- No, I wasn't. - Right. Same here.

852
00:39:42,087 --> 00:39:43,287
- I was getting to know you. - But...

853
00:39:43,288 --> 00:39:45,527
But you made it sound like you were.

854
00:39:45,528 --> 00:39:46,758
That's what you think.

855
00:39:47,428 --> 00:39:48,828
But I liked you too.

856
00:39:50,937 --> 00:39:53,497
I see. You weren't sure about me.

857
00:39:55,238 --> 00:39:59,107
To me, during our 1st and 2nd dates, you made it sound like...

858
00:39:59,738 --> 00:40:00,948
your mind was already...

859
00:40:01,877 --> 00:40:03,106
- made up. - Made up?

860
00:40:03,107 --> 00:40:04,348
That's how you sounded.

861
00:40:05,977 --> 00:40:07,587
- But now, I feel like... - Okay.

862
00:40:08,817 --> 00:40:09,988
that wasn't the case.

863
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:14,657
My feelings for Jung Sub grew a lot...

864
00:40:14,658 --> 00:40:16,957
because he gave me a sense of certainty.

865
00:40:17,857 --> 00:40:19,697
But I realized that...

866
00:40:19,698 --> 00:40:22,497
the basis of my thought could be a misunderstanding.

867
00:40:23,667 --> 00:40:26,968
Earlier, I felt that the foundation between us was a bit unstable too.

868
00:40:27,638 --> 00:40:29,508
Why? Because I sent the letter to Yong Woo?

869
00:40:30,408 --> 00:40:33,078
Right. Because he was the first guy you were interested in.

870
00:40:34,848 --> 00:40:39,078
I thought you and Ju Yeon were siblings.

871
00:40:40,278 --> 00:40:41,417
Gosh, come on.

872
00:40:42,218 --> 00:40:43,647
Don't lie.

873
00:40:44,988 --> 00:40:46,456
Was it that night? Or the next day?

874
00:40:46,457 --> 00:40:47,987
When we were talking about our MBTI types,

875
00:40:47,988 --> 00:40:49,828
you and Ju Yeon were sitting side by side.

876
00:40:50,328 --> 00:40:51,558
That's when I realized it.

877
00:40:52,357 --> 00:40:54,397
- "I sent it to the wrong person." - I doubt it.

878
00:40:54,667 --> 00:40:55,698
I don't think so.

879
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:57,598
Why would I lie about this?

880
00:40:57,968 --> 00:41:00,337
- There are many reasons to lie. - Why?

881
00:41:00,738 --> 00:41:05,077
Se Seung thought that Ju Yeon and I were siblings.

882
00:41:05,078 --> 00:41:06,508
So she said she gave the letter to Ju Yeon.

883
00:41:06,908 --> 00:41:08,746
But wasn't it obvious to everyone...

884
00:41:08,747 --> 00:41:11,948
that Ju Yeon and Yong Woo were siblings?

885
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:14,618
So I was like...

886
00:41:23,997 --> 00:41:26,226
(If you extend the date, your date will continue at a different spot.)

887
00:41:26,227 --> 00:41:28,827
(If you don't extend it, you will go to the lodging.)

888
00:41:28,828 --> 00:41:31,698
(Will you extend the date? But you cannot discuss it.)

889
00:41:31,868 --> 00:41:33,496
(I'll extend it.)

890
00:41:33,497 --> 00:41:34,508
This...

891
00:41:34,868 --> 00:41:35,908
And so...

892
00:41:42,477 --> 00:41:43,706
It's so funny.

893
00:41:43,707 --> 00:41:46,646
We were right in the middle of a conversation,

894
00:41:46,647 --> 00:41:49,587
so I'm sure both of us wanted to continue our conversation.

895
00:41:52,258 --> 00:41:55,327
- That lightened the mood. - That's funny.

896
00:41:55,328 --> 00:41:56,828
That made them more relaxed.

897
00:41:57,028 --> 00:41:59,297
If they left at that moment, that would be a disaster.

898
00:42:02,098 --> 00:42:05,566
(Cho A and Yong Woo on a river cruise)

899
00:42:05,567 --> 00:42:06,567
Two beers.

900
00:42:06,568 --> 00:42:08,207
(The two came to ride a boat.)

901
00:42:08,437 --> 00:42:09,566
Thank you.

902
00:42:09,567 --> 00:42:12,837
(They bought canned beers to drink on the boat.)

903
00:42:15,308 --> 00:42:16,377
That must be it.

904
00:42:22,087 --> 00:42:23,147
It's taking off.

905
00:42:23,988 --> 00:42:25,618
I feel like we're going backward.

906
00:42:28,158 --> 00:42:29,187
It's going.

907
00:42:30,087 --> 00:42:31,098
Ta-da.

908
00:42:36,997 --> 00:42:39,397
- That must be super scary. - Oh, dear.

909
00:42:39,797 --> 00:42:41,537
- That's true. There's something. - Right?

910
00:42:41,538 --> 00:42:43,937
It's so beautiful.

911
00:42:45,678 --> 00:42:48,578
Even how people are eating there.

912
00:42:49,707 --> 00:42:50,717
They're greeting us.

913
00:42:50,718 --> 00:42:52,017
- Where? - There.

914
00:42:54,247 --> 00:42:56,448
Many people greet us here.

915
00:42:59,817 --> 00:43:01,187
It feels like a dream.

916
00:43:17,138 --> 00:43:19,078
I was really thankful at that moment.

917
00:43:19,207 --> 00:43:21,707
After they played our clip,

918
00:43:22,278 --> 00:43:24,778
- you gave Cheol Hyeon a hug. - Yes.

919
00:43:24,948 --> 00:43:26,947
- Right. I did. - I saw that.

920
00:43:26,948 --> 00:43:28,448
I was just thankful for you.

921
00:43:29,948 --> 00:43:32,658
(After it was revealed that they were siblings,)

922
00:43:32,917 --> 00:43:35,957
(Yong Woo hugged Cheol Hyeon.)

923
00:43:37,288 --> 00:43:40,157
I always thought...

924
00:43:40,158 --> 00:43:42,767
I wanted to thank him for it.

925
00:43:43,368 --> 00:43:44,767
Why didn't you hug me then?

926
00:43:46,797 --> 00:43:48,008
- There? - Yes.

927
00:43:48,368 --> 00:43:50,138
- There were too many people around. - Is that so?

928
00:43:51,207 --> 00:43:53,178
There was something about Cheol Hyeon...

929
00:43:53,377 --> 00:43:54,947
that made me want to hug him more.

930
00:43:54,948 --> 00:43:56,707
- Is that so? - I don't know why, though.

931
00:43:57,078 --> 00:43:59,077
After saying that,

932
00:43:59,078 --> 00:44:01,247
I thought to myself, "Why did I say that?"

933
00:44:02,817 --> 00:44:05,117
When I like someone...

934
00:44:05,118 --> 00:44:07,217
or feel comfortable around them,

935
00:44:07,218 --> 00:44:09,927
I want to see...

936
00:44:09,928 --> 00:44:11,857
what they think about me.

937
00:44:12,058 --> 00:44:15,967
When I think we got pretty close,

938
00:44:15,968 --> 00:44:17,667
I can't help making those comments.

939
00:44:17,897 --> 00:44:20,538
But it might make the other person a little uncomfortable.

940
00:44:21,138 --> 00:44:23,166
I think I'm having a hard time...

941
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:25,436
because I'm somewhere along the line.

942
00:44:25,437 --> 00:44:28,876
I feel like when I express my feelings straightforwardly,

943
00:44:28,877 --> 00:44:31,546
he keeps his distance from me.

944
00:44:31,547 --> 00:44:33,747
I feel that way sometimes.

945
00:44:35,187 --> 00:44:37,558
I love how quiet it is here.

946
00:44:37,687 --> 00:44:39,488
- The silence? Me too. - Yes.

947
00:44:39,817 --> 00:44:41,558
- It's so calm and... - Right.

948
00:44:43,127 --> 00:44:44,528
You seemed to need...

949
00:44:45,127 --> 00:44:47,598
more time to be alone than I thought.

950
00:44:48,098 --> 00:44:49,126
- Me? - Yes.

951
00:44:49,127 --> 00:44:50,936
- Of course. - Right?

952
00:44:50,937 --> 00:44:54,807
You love spending time with people,

953
00:44:54,808 --> 00:44:57,638
but you also seemed to need some time to yourself.

954
00:45:00,207 --> 00:45:02,678
- This is surreal. - I know.

955
00:45:09,817 --> 00:45:12,758
I love hearing the sound of the water now.

956
00:45:12,857 --> 00:45:13,917
Me too.

957
00:45:28,738 --> 00:45:30,707
I will never forget the taste of this beer.

958
00:45:31,078 --> 00:45:32,078
Right?

959
00:45:42,087 --> 00:45:45,618
The night view was stunning.

960
00:45:45,988 --> 00:45:47,987
The view was beautiful,

961
00:45:47,988 --> 00:45:51,857
and there were a few minutes...

962
00:45:52,297 --> 00:45:56,297
when we didn't talk and stayed silent.

963
00:46:05,008 --> 00:46:06,078
What are you thinking about?

964
00:46:06,607 --> 00:46:07,808
- Me? - Yes.

965
00:46:08,747 --> 00:46:09,778
During...

966
00:46:11,348 --> 00:46:14,287
the past two weeks we've spent together,

967
00:46:14,288 --> 00:46:15,288
Yes?

968
00:46:15,417 --> 00:46:16,747
this moment right now...

969
00:46:18,558 --> 00:46:19,657
is one of the best.

970
00:46:19,658 --> 00:46:20,687
Is that so?

971
00:46:23,488 --> 00:46:24,828
Is it one of the best moments?

972
00:46:25,957 --> 00:46:29,627
I wished time would pass more slowly.

973
00:46:37,808 --> 00:46:40,008
Actually, there were many times when I didn't know...

974
00:46:40,678 --> 00:46:43,746
who sent me the text when I received it.

975
00:46:43,747 --> 00:46:46,578
- Really? - For real.

976
00:46:46,917 --> 00:46:48,117
How is that possible?

977
00:46:48,118 --> 00:46:49,687
I made it very obvious.

978
00:46:50,417 --> 00:46:51,487
I once texted...

979
00:46:51,488 --> 00:46:54,226
"Hair up and hair down. What's next?"

980
00:46:54,227 --> 00:46:55,456
Then you texted me back...

981
00:46:55,457 --> 00:46:58,126
like you were responding to that text.

982
00:46:58,127 --> 00:47:00,996
When I saw that text, I realized it was you.

983
00:47:00,997 --> 00:47:01,997
I see.

984
00:47:02,227 --> 00:47:04,336
- Is that when you realized? - Yes.

985
00:47:04,337 --> 00:47:07,537
Before that moment, I wasn't sure if it was you.

986
00:47:07,538 --> 00:47:09,468
It could be a hasty assumption.

987
00:47:10,308 --> 00:47:12,177
When we went on the Random Date,

988
00:47:12,178 --> 00:47:14,107
I thought you'd recognize me for sure.

989
00:47:14,877 --> 00:47:15,907
Hello.

990
00:47:15,908 --> 00:47:18,017
(When they had the Ring-ring Date)

991
00:47:18,218 --> 00:47:19,277
Who is this?

992
00:47:19,278 --> 00:47:21,488
(Cho A recognized Yong Woo's voice immediately.)

993
00:47:23,888 --> 00:47:25,158
Hi.

994
00:47:25,258 --> 00:47:26,388
Hi.

995
00:47:27,388 --> 00:47:31,227
(Yong Woo didn't expect it was Cho A at all.)

996
00:47:31,457 --> 00:47:33,158
I figured out why later.

997
00:47:34,098 --> 00:47:35,968
Your energy level is different...

998
00:47:36,098 --> 00:47:38,496
when you're with others...

999
00:47:38,497 --> 00:47:40,766
- compared to when you're with me. - It's different?

1000
00:47:40,767 --> 00:47:42,237
I think it's different.

1001
00:47:42,238 --> 00:47:43,266
You were much more upbeat...

1002
00:47:43,267 --> 00:47:44,976
- than when we were all together. - Right.

1003
00:47:44,977 --> 00:47:46,336
So I naturally thought...

1004
00:47:46,337 --> 00:47:48,106
you could be someone else,

1005
00:47:48,107 --> 00:47:50,008
which confused me a little.

1006
00:47:50,607 --> 00:47:53,546
If we were talking, and there were other people around,

1007
00:47:53,547 --> 00:47:54,887
I'd be the one asking questions...

1008
00:47:54,888 --> 00:47:58,317
ninety percent of the time, and you'd only be answering.

1009
00:47:58,888 --> 00:48:00,488
But when we're alone. it's the opposite.

1010
00:48:02,028 --> 00:48:04,957
I'm learning these things about you.

1011
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:08,767
What I liked about Cho A...

1012
00:48:08,968 --> 00:48:12,867
was that she was quiet and thoughtful.

1013
00:48:12,868 --> 00:48:15,507
After spending the whole day with her,

1014
00:48:15,508 --> 00:48:17,468
I learned a different side of her.

1015
00:48:18,477 --> 00:48:22,308
I felt a little weird.

1016
00:48:22,477 --> 00:48:25,547
When you're alone with me,

1017
00:48:26,348 --> 00:48:27,417
your energy level is completely different.

1018
00:48:27,547 --> 00:48:29,087
I think...

1019
00:48:29,817 --> 00:48:31,517
it's something charming...

1020
00:48:33,187 --> 00:48:34,217
about you.

1021
00:48:34,218 --> 00:48:35,327
I see.

1022
00:48:35,328 --> 00:48:39,197
You make the other person feel special.

1023
00:48:39,198 --> 00:48:40,227
I do?

1024
00:48:40,598 --> 00:48:43,267
That makes me feel good.

1025
00:48:43,368 --> 00:48:45,396
There are people I find myself...

1026
00:48:45,397 --> 00:48:47,667
wanting to talk more with,

1027
00:48:48,468 --> 00:48:51,607
and there are those I want to listen to more.

1028
00:48:51,808 --> 00:48:54,808
When I'm with you,

1029
00:48:55,508 --> 00:48:58,247
I feel like I become in between them.

1030
00:48:58,718 --> 00:49:01,147
Right. I don't feel like I'm the only person talking.

1031
00:49:08,087 --> 00:49:09,087
Oh, dear!

1032
00:49:10,988 --> 00:49:13,797
- There is a fountain show going on. - That's crazy.

1033
00:49:17,528 --> 00:49:20,397
- It looks so cool up close. - I know.

1034
00:49:29,308 --> 00:49:30,308
Goodness.

1035
00:49:35,517 --> 00:49:37,086
Earlier I said, I wasn't sure...

1036
00:49:37,087 --> 00:49:39,488
if you were really into me from your texts.

1037
00:49:40,118 --> 00:49:42,957
When I read your texts, I could tell they were meant for me,

1038
00:49:43,288 --> 00:49:45,797
but when I was with you in person, I couldn't tell if you were into me.

1039
00:49:46,328 --> 00:49:50,428
When I saw you with other people.

1040
00:49:51,797 --> 00:49:53,698
Then once,

1041
00:49:54,297 --> 00:49:57,238
you were sad about our date,

1042
00:49:57,337 --> 00:49:59,137
so you asked me out again.

1043
00:49:59,138 --> 00:50:00,778
I was touched at that time.

1044
00:50:02,078 --> 00:50:03,808
I felt great that day.

1045
00:50:04,778 --> 00:50:07,717
That was the first moment...

1046
00:50:07,718 --> 00:50:10,948
when I felt like he sent me a direct sign.

1047
00:50:12,558 --> 00:50:13,956
(The photo and the flowers from that day...)

1048
00:50:13,957 --> 00:50:16,727
(were special to Cho A.)

1049
00:50:19,397 --> 00:50:21,198
It made me feel secure.

1050
00:50:22,397 --> 00:50:24,467
I was also thankful.

1051
00:50:24,468 --> 00:50:25,666
I also thought...

1052
00:50:25,667 --> 00:50:28,468
I should feel less insecure.

1053
00:50:28,837 --> 00:50:30,266
That's when I realized...

1054
00:50:30,267 --> 00:50:32,837
you speak more with your actions than with words.

1055
00:50:34,008 --> 00:50:35,078
Right?

1056
00:50:35,707 --> 00:50:36,948
I think so.

1057
00:50:37,477 --> 00:50:39,917
You don't make it a little vague with your words.

1058
00:50:41,078 --> 00:50:42,516
Which one is better?

1059
00:50:42,517 --> 00:50:43,718
What if I gave you certainty with words and acted vaguely?

1060
00:50:44,558 --> 00:50:46,357
Make it obvious with both your actions and words.

1061
00:50:46,587 --> 00:50:48,258
- Both actions and words? - Yes.

1062
00:50:48,288 --> 00:50:50,287
For my actions to be sincere,

1063
00:50:50,288 --> 00:50:53,827
I have to be sure about my feelings.

1064
00:50:53,828 --> 00:50:54,828
I see.

1065
00:50:54,828 --> 00:50:55,828
I didn't want to lie.

1066
00:50:56,297 --> 00:50:59,497
- You didn't want to show it... - I didn't want to force myself...

1067
00:50:59,567 --> 00:51:01,537
- or lie... - until you were sure about it.

1068
00:51:01,538 --> 00:51:02,606
But I didn't want to.

1069
00:51:02,607 --> 00:51:03,607
I see.

1070
00:51:06,377 --> 00:51:08,477
There's a story behind it.

1071
00:51:09,178 --> 00:51:11,317
I didn't expect Ju Yeon and me to win first place.

1072
00:51:11,517 --> 00:51:13,876
We just wanted to enjoy ourselves on stage,

1073
00:51:13,877 --> 00:51:15,487
but they loved it.

1074
00:51:15,488 --> 00:51:17,186
- You didn't know you'd win. - Right.

1075
00:51:17,187 --> 00:51:19,257
I didn't expect to win when I went on stage.

1076
00:51:19,258 --> 00:51:23,087
I just followed my heart at the moment.

1077
00:51:23,988 --> 00:51:25,997
So you hadn't thought about it to some extent?

1078
00:51:26,158 --> 00:51:28,198
Was it just how you were feeling at the moment?

1079
00:51:28,698 --> 00:51:31,067
When it got to a moment I had to choose,

1080
00:51:31,997 --> 00:51:33,197
I was like, "Should I do this?"

1081
00:51:33,198 --> 00:51:36,207
"It would be fun this way."

1082
00:51:38,078 --> 00:51:39,078
"Would she like it?"

1083
00:51:39,079 --> 00:51:40,977
That's what I thought.

1084
00:51:42,147 --> 00:51:46,947
I felt like he was taking a step back.

1085
00:51:46,948 --> 00:51:49,487
I realized again...

1086
00:51:49,488 --> 00:51:51,717
that you can't control...

1087
00:51:51,718 --> 00:51:53,387
how you feel.

1088
00:51:53,388 --> 00:51:55,887
In my head, I was thinking...

1089
00:51:55,888 --> 00:51:58,328
I should step back a little,

1090
00:51:58,428 --> 00:52:00,226
but I was already speaking and acting...

1091
00:52:00,227 --> 00:52:01,368
without holding back.

1092
00:52:01,767 --> 00:52:05,667
I think that's why those situations keep happening.

1093
00:52:07,437 --> 00:52:09,767
I wished...

1094
00:52:10,038 --> 00:52:13,077
my time with Cho A was more fun...

1095
00:52:13,078 --> 00:52:15,107
and she didn't bring those things up.

1096
00:52:16,078 --> 00:52:18,416
There was such a beautiful night view around us.

1097
00:52:18,417 --> 00:52:20,177
From what I thought,

1098
00:52:20,178 --> 00:52:21,718
I met a good person,

1099
00:52:22,017 --> 00:52:25,587
and I got to spend time with her there as I wanted...

1100
00:52:25,988 --> 00:52:29,258
because I grew feelings for her.

1101
00:52:29,558 --> 00:52:32,997
So I wondered why I was feeling the way I was.

1102
00:52:33,158 --> 00:52:35,797
I hated myself a little...

1103
00:52:36,698 --> 00:52:38,837
at that moment.

1104
00:52:44,977 --> 00:52:47,407
Those moments are the hardest when you're on a date.

1105
00:52:47,408 --> 00:52:48,777
Right. It's so hard.

1106
00:52:48,778 --> 00:52:50,677
There was something...

1107
00:52:50,678 --> 00:52:53,246
she wanted to hear from him.

1108
00:52:53,247 --> 00:52:56,746
She kept bringing up certain moments,

1109
00:52:56,747 --> 00:52:58,117
trying to find out how he felt at that time.

1110
00:52:58,118 --> 00:53:01,186
But for him, he loved the atmosphere there,

1111
00:53:01,187 --> 00:53:03,126
so he wished she just enjoyed the moment.

1112
00:53:03,127 --> 00:53:06,927
But you could want to have a talk like Cho A did too.

1113
00:53:06,928 --> 00:53:08,927
- Right. I understand them both. - That's true.

1114
00:53:08,928 --> 00:53:11,997
Haven't we all been in that situation?

1115
00:53:12,267 --> 00:53:14,607
- Right. That always happens. - Right.

1116
00:53:15,008 --> 00:53:16,908
- Yes. Right. - It's always like...

1117
00:53:17,567 --> 00:53:18,638
Jonathan.

1118
00:53:19,877 --> 00:53:21,137
- You just repeated what we said. - No.

1119
00:53:21,138 --> 00:53:22,847
- Jonathan. - You sounded like a parrot.

1120
00:53:22,848 --> 00:53:24,976
Of course!

1121
00:53:24,977 --> 00:53:27,348
- You should agree too! - Right.

1122
00:53:28,087 --> 00:53:29,388
It breaks my heart.

1123
00:53:31,087 --> 00:53:34,017
What if you didn't have your first date with me?

1124
00:53:35,457 --> 00:53:37,428
I know. I guess...

1125
00:53:40,127 --> 00:53:42,996
I can't really say that the circumstances...

1126
00:53:42,997 --> 00:53:44,667
- didn't play a role. - Right?

1127
00:53:45,238 --> 00:53:46,566
That's fascinating.

1128
00:53:46,567 --> 00:53:49,408
That date had a huge impact on me.

1129
00:53:50,267 --> 00:53:51,337
So...

1130
00:53:52,337 --> 00:53:54,008
I'm grateful to her.

1131
00:53:54,207 --> 00:53:56,476
- Right. Ju Yeon helped us. - She gave me the letter.

1132
00:53:56,477 --> 00:53:58,917
- She was the Cupid. - She gave me the Cupid Message.

1133
00:53:59,817 --> 00:54:02,718
She said you were her favourite.

1134
00:54:02,888 --> 00:54:05,158
Me? Really?

1135
00:54:05,288 --> 00:54:08,828
If you think about it, Ju Yeon chose you.

1136
00:54:08,988 --> 00:54:12,157
This might be just how I feel.

1137
00:54:12,158 --> 00:54:14,796
But I've been under the impression...

1138
00:54:14,797 --> 00:54:18,666
that Ju Yeon is helping him with our relationship.

1139
00:54:18,667 --> 00:54:22,206
"Isn't Ju Yeon helping him a lot?"

1140
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:24,836
"Isn't it more like what she wants?"

1141
00:54:24,837 --> 00:54:26,107
I always have...

1142
00:54:26,678 --> 00:54:30,047
these thoughts in the back of my mind.

1143
00:54:32,017 --> 00:54:33,416
(If you extend the date, your date will continue at a different spot.)

1144
00:54:33,417 --> 00:54:34,988
(If you don't extend it, you will go to the dorm.)

1145
00:54:35,087 --> 00:54:39,357
(Will you extend the date? But you cannot discuss it.)

1146
00:54:48,627 --> 00:54:50,697
Without hesitation,

1147
00:54:50,698 --> 00:54:53,238
I wanted to extend the date.

1148
00:54:53,968 --> 00:54:56,567
I was the most hesitant at that moment.

1149
00:55:04,278 --> 00:55:08,186
(The date has been extended.)

1150
00:55:08,187 --> 00:55:09,747
I decided to talk to her more.

1151
00:55:12,558 --> 00:55:13,558
(Their date has been extended.)

1152
00:55:13,559 --> 00:55:15,558
It's good to talk to you a lot today.

1153
00:55:15,957 --> 00:55:18,126
I don't see a reason to rush to the dorm,

1154
00:55:18,127 --> 00:55:19,127
- Yes. - Right?

1155
00:55:19,428 --> 00:55:20,758
I like this more.

1156
00:55:22,098 --> 00:55:24,167
(Two participants are eagerly waiting for their siblings.)

1157
00:55:26,297 --> 00:55:28,637
What text did you receive?

1158
00:55:28,638 --> 00:55:30,908
Do you want to hear what I received?

1159
00:55:31,067 --> 00:55:32,407
(Cheol Hyeon also received a text that his sibling extended her date.)

1160
00:55:32,408 --> 00:55:35,477
Did she extend the date?

1161
00:55:38,218 --> 00:55:40,416
She extended it twice already.

1162
00:55:40,417 --> 00:55:41,517
My brother too!

1163
00:55:43,948 --> 00:55:46,717
We had to choose our room,

1164
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:49,388
so on the one hand, I hoped she'd come home soon.

1165
00:55:49,928 --> 00:55:50,987
On the other hand, I was okay with it.

1166
00:55:50,988 --> 00:55:53,226
Any room would have been fine by me.

1167
00:55:53,227 --> 00:55:55,327
I just hoped she could fully enjoy that time.

1168
00:55:55,328 --> 00:55:56,368
That was what I was mostly thinking.

1169
00:55:56,497 --> 00:55:58,436
So the fate...

1170
00:55:58,437 --> 00:56:00,737
was already decided on that day.

1171
00:56:00,738 --> 00:56:04,777
Since the moment we lost in the duet contest.

1172
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:06,537
- Right. - The losers are the winners now.

1173
00:56:06,538 --> 00:56:07,677
I know.

1174
00:56:07,678 --> 00:56:09,948
Once your sibling arrives,

1175
00:56:10,348 --> 00:56:12,277
you can just take them to your room quietly.

1176
00:56:12,278 --> 00:56:14,546
- Right. You take them quietly. - "Follow me."

1177
00:56:14,547 --> 00:56:15,547
"Lie down."

1178
00:56:16,118 --> 00:56:18,488
Jung Sub, I want you to become the second person to come.

1179
00:56:19,258 --> 00:56:21,187
Go up and lie down with Ji Won. You must be cold.

1180
00:56:21,587 --> 00:56:22,587
You can lie in my bed.

1181
00:56:23,127 --> 00:56:24,856
I can't do that.

1182
00:56:24,857 --> 00:56:25,928
Just go lie down.

1183
00:56:26,158 --> 00:56:27,627
It's cold here. You might catch a cold.

1184
00:56:28,098 --> 00:56:30,226
- Yun Ha, lie down. - Lie down.

1185
00:56:30,227 --> 00:56:32,097
- Can I lie in your brother's bed? - Yes.

1186
00:56:32,098 --> 00:56:34,667
- I'm doing this even before him. - Sure.

1187
00:56:35,437 --> 00:56:37,537
When will everyone be back?

1188
00:56:37,538 --> 00:56:39,538
I don't know. When will they come?

1189
00:56:39,837 --> 00:56:41,907
I even received a text...

1190
00:56:41,908 --> 00:56:44,376
that he extended the date twice.

1191
00:56:44,377 --> 00:56:46,578
Really? You receive that text.

1192
00:56:46,678 --> 00:56:48,586
What are the other pairs doing?

1193
00:56:48,587 --> 00:56:50,686
- Other teams... - Yong Woo and Ju Yeon...

1194
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:51,787
must be having a blast since they won first place.

1195
00:56:51,788 --> 00:56:53,288
Will they go to Marina Bay Sands?

1196
00:56:54,118 --> 00:56:56,187
They might not come today, then.

1197
00:56:58,727 --> 00:56:59,956
(Se Seung and Jung Sub, Date in Singapore)

1198
00:56:59,957 --> 00:57:02,197
I feel like I tell you everything.

1199
00:57:02,198 --> 00:57:03,227
Not at all.

1200
00:57:03,598 --> 00:57:04,627
- No? - No.

1201
00:57:05,497 --> 00:57:06,698
- I don't think so. - What about you?

1202
00:57:06,937 --> 00:57:07,968
Me?

1203
00:57:08,138 --> 00:57:10,138
I try not to tell you everything, but I can't help it.

1204
00:57:10,538 --> 00:57:12,937
You didn't, and it worked.

1205
00:57:13,238 --> 00:57:14,977
- Really? - I still can't figure you out.

1206
00:57:15,247 --> 00:57:16,278
I don't know you well either.

1207
00:57:17,377 --> 00:57:19,747
- You don't know how I feel? - No, not really.

1208
00:57:21,718 --> 00:57:22,746
You're lying.

1209
00:57:22,747 --> 00:57:24,888
I'm telling you the truth.

1210
00:57:26,517 --> 00:57:28,686
Anyway, I decided to trust you, no matter what.

1211
00:57:28,687 --> 00:57:29,957
I won't have any doubts.

1212
00:57:30,328 --> 00:57:31,357
You should trust me too.

1213
00:57:32,558 --> 00:57:34,258
- Trust what? - Me.

1214
00:57:34,997 --> 00:57:38,127
I didn't receive any message from you.

1215
00:57:38,397 --> 00:57:39,397
- Message? - Yes.

1216
00:57:39,397 --> 00:57:40,397
What kind of message?

1217
00:57:40,598 --> 00:57:44,066
When we had a talk in our hideout,

1218
00:57:44,067 --> 00:57:47,577
your feelings were not clearly communicated to me.

1219
00:57:47,578 --> 00:57:50,847
- They were not? - I don't know where your heart is.

1220
00:57:50,848 --> 00:57:52,617
I'm not sure if you said I bothered you...

1221
00:57:52,618 --> 00:57:54,887
when you were going in a different direction.

1222
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:57,987
Requesting a talk with you in the hideout...

1223
00:57:57,988 --> 00:57:59,817
- was already a big move for me. - Did it take courage?

1224
00:57:59,988 --> 00:58:01,258
Of course.

1225
00:58:03,587 --> 00:58:06,257
It's more shocking...

1226
00:58:06,258 --> 00:58:07,356
that you don't know about my feelings.

1227
00:58:07,357 --> 00:58:08,867
Well,

1228
00:58:08,868 --> 00:58:11,796
I felt like you were nice to everyone.

1229
00:58:11,797 --> 00:58:13,067
- Me? - Yes.

1230
00:58:13,567 --> 00:58:15,507
I do like people,

1231
00:58:15,508 --> 00:58:17,206
- Right. I can tell. - but...

1232
00:58:17,207 --> 00:58:19,437
That personality really stands out.

1233
00:58:19,638 --> 00:58:22,046
That's really lovely and everything,

1234
00:58:22,047 --> 00:58:23,246
- so... - But...

1235
00:58:23,247 --> 00:58:26,246
I feel like you're loved by everyone.

1236
00:58:26,247 --> 00:58:29,987
Really? I thought I was acting completely differently around you.

1237
00:58:29,988 --> 00:58:31,417
Is that so?

1238
00:58:32,658 --> 00:58:34,058
Then I'll get to know you better.

1239
00:58:36,587 --> 00:58:38,356
Before coming to Singapore,

1240
00:58:38,357 --> 00:58:40,856
I felt insecure,

1241
00:58:40,857 --> 00:58:43,097
thinking he didn't like me that much.

1242
00:58:43,098 --> 00:58:46,037
It turns out he was feeling the same way.

1243
00:58:46,038 --> 00:58:47,968
I realized we both had the wrong idea,

1244
00:58:48,138 --> 00:58:51,567
and it did make me feel better.

1245
00:58:52,538 --> 00:58:54,308
- You got a text. Check. - I got a text.

1246
00:58:54,707 --> 00:58:56,407
(From now on, you can end the date at any time.)

1247
00:58:56,408 --> 00:58:58,146
(Would you like to end the date?)

1248
00:58:58,147 --> 00:59:00,746
- I see. - It's a little say to say,

1249
00:59:00,747 --> 00:59:02,917
- but you want to end it, right? - I do.

1250
00:59:03,988 --> 00:59:05,618
How cold you are!

1251
00:59:06,087 --> 00:59:08,487
- Hey, wait. - We can talk more there.

1252
00:59:08,488 --> 00:59:10,157
Hold on. I'll respond first.

1253
00:59:10,158 --> 00:59:11,327
I'll do it first.

1254
00:59:11,328 --> 00:59:13,396
No! I'll do it first.

1255
00:59:13,397 --> 00:59:14,967
(- I want to end it. - I'd like to end it.)

1256
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:16,266
We sent it almost at the same time.

1257
00:59:16,267 --> 00:59:17,996
You're so mean.

1258
00:59:17,997 --> 00:59:19,566
You could've let me win this time.

1259
00:59:19,567 --> 00:59:21,566
I did. You sent it first.

1260
00:59:21,567 --> 00:59:22,607
I saw it.

1261
00:59:23,567 --> 00:59:25,537
That kind of relationship might last longer.

1262
00:59:25,538 --> 00:59:27,737
While I was watching them, this thought came to mind.

1263
00:59:27,738 --> 00:59:30,008
Your friend asks for advice on their relationship.

1264
00:59:30,147 --> 00:59:31,816
They say what their boyfriend did,

1265
00:59:31,817 --> 00:59:33,516
and I tell them to break up.

1266
00:59:33,517 --> 00:59:34,577
They break up and get back together again.

1267
00:59:34,578 --> 00:59:38,287
- I know those people. - They can't cut each other off.

1268
00:59:38,288 --> 00:59:40,217
- They keep bickering and dating. - Yes.

1269
00:59:40,218 --> 00:59:42,626
Don't you think they get along?

1270
00:59:42,627 --> 00:59:43,827
I hope you guys date!

1271
00:59:43,828 --> 00:59:45,626
- But I... - I'm not sure about Jung Sub.

1272
00:59:45,627 --> 00:59:46,698
Right.

1273
00:59:46,897 --> 00:59:49,328
(On their way back to the dorm)

1274
00:59:50,067 --> 00:59:51,868
(Peeking)

1275
00:59:54,598 --> 00:59:55,667
You got something here.

1276
00:59:56,707 --> 00:59:57,707
What is this?

1277
00:59:59,937 --> 01:00:01,976
- Hey! - You have something here.

1278
01:00:01,977 --> 01:00:03,647
What do I have?

1279
01:00:04,508 --> 01:00:06,718
The food we had?

1280
01:00:07,718 --> 01:00:10,547
It's more like a piece of tire than food.

1281
01:00:12,788 --> 01:00:13,987
Did you touch something?

1282
01:00:13,988 --> 01:00:15,528
I'll wipe it myself.

1283
01:00:15,928 --> 01:00:17,457
Can you see it? You can kind of see it, right?

1284
01:00:18,497 --> 01:00:20,657
- Goodness. - That part was so dark.

1285
01:00:20,658 --> 01:00:22,126
You looked like a dummy.

1286
01:00:22,127 --> 01:00:23,828
Like a dummy with a snot.

1287
01:00:25,198 --> 01:00:29,538
I think you and I really click.

1288
01:00:30,207 --> 01:00:32,408
You're so funny.

1289
01:00:33,207 --> 01:00:34,477
What kind of girl is she?

1290
01:00:35,808 --> 01:00:38,247
Have you ever met someone who clicked this well?

1291
01:00:38,948 --> 01:00:40,317
Not really.

1292
01:00:40,578 --> 01:00:42,618
Not really? That means you have.

1293
01:00:45,218 --> 01:00:47,488
Aren't you tired? You must be sleepy.

1294
01:00:47,758 --> 01:00:49,828
I'm not tired when I'm with you.

1295
01:00:52,997 --> 01:00:56,697
- What are they doing? - I should meet a guy like Se Seung.

1296
01:00:56,698 --> 01:00:58,267
My dream partner is Se Seung!

1297
01:00:58,968 --> 01:01:00,397
"When I'm with you..."

1298
01:01:01,437 --> 01:01:02,437
What? Did he fall asleep?

1299
01:01:02,438 --> 01:01:04,308
- Oh, my. - What is wrong with him?

1300
01:01:11,308 --> 01:01:12,647
He was super tired.

1301
01:01:17,448 --> 01:01:18,488
What?

1302
01:01:19,658 --> 01:01:21,686
I love Jung Sub so much.

1303
01:01:21,687 --> 01:01:23,856
They look like a real couple.

1304
01:01:23,857 --> 01:01:26,397
I love him. He's so funny.

1305
01:01:28,158 --> 01:01:29,297
(His head drops.)

1306
01:02:13,908 --> 01:02:15,007
There you go.

1307
01:02:15,008 --> 01:02:16,077
- I'm jealous. - That thumb movement...

1308
01:02:16,078 --> 01:02:17,146
will make her heart flutter.

1309
01:02:17,147 --> 01:02:19,278
- Right. He slightly touched her. - His thumb brushed her arm.

1310
01:02:19,517 --> 01:02:20,577
- Really? - That's important.

1311
01:02:20,578 --> 01:02:22,086
Everyone, thumbs are important.

1312
01:02:22,087 --> 01:02:25,618
- Goodness. - Zoom in on the thumb later.

1313
01:02:26,388 --> 01:02:27,916
- Look at his thumb closely. - Yes.

1314
01:02:27,917 --> 01:02:29,727
Holding her arm isn't a point. Look at his thumb.

1315
01:02:29,828 --> 01:02:31,626
- He rubbed it. That's important. - Yes.

1316
01:02:31,627 --> 01:02:33,427
- You saw it, BamBam. - Rubbing her arm with his thumb...

1317
01:02:33,428 --> 01:02:34,428
shows his feelings more...

1318
01:02:34,429 --> 01:02:35,567
- rather than just holding it. - Right.

1319
01:03:07,058 --> 01:03:10,897
I thought my heart was going to explode.

1320
01:03:11,528 --> 01:03:13,437
That's the only thing I focused on.

1321
01:03:13,767 --> 01:03:16,408
We didn't hold hands like this.

1322
01:03:18,008 --> 01:03:19,278
He just put his hand...

1323
01:03:19,808 --> 01:03:21,437
on mine like this.

1324
01:03:24,508 --> 01:03:26,578
I think we held hands.

1325
01:03:27,017 --> 01:03:31,087
I think our hands touched like this.

1326
01:03:32,587 --> 01:03:33,587
Yes.

1327
01:04:04,587 --> 01:04:07,988
(Cho A and Yong Woo's date in Singapore)

1328
01:04:08,388 --> 01:04:11,457
It must be very special with that much age gap.

1329
01:04:12,058 --> 01:04:13,697
I don't really feel it's special,

1330
01:04:13,698 --> 01:04:14,698
- to be honest. - You don't?

1331
01:04:14,957 --> 01:04:17,397
I don't give it much significance.

1332
01:04:17,797 --> 01:04:19,567
Your family has a more special relationship than my family does.

1333
01:04:19,767 --> 01:04:22,407
Us? Right. We're special.

1334
01:04:22,408 --> 01:04:25,278
But we've only recently grown very affectionate toward each other.

1335
01:04:25,977 --> 01:04:27,337
I think we're working hard.

1336
01:04:28,008 --> 01:04:30,876
We work hard to maintain a good relationship...

1337
01:04:30,877 --> 01:04:32,278
with people we meet outside.

1338
01:04:32,848 --> 01:04:37,146
But we often take people we're very close to...

1339
01:04:37,147 --> 01:04:39,086
- for granted. - Right.

1340
01:04:39,087 --> 01:04:41,417
We don't often express our feelings to them.

1341
01:04:41,888 --> 01:04:43,987
So if I express my feelings to others once,

1342
01:04:43,988 --> 01:04:46,598
I express my feelings to my family twice.

1343
01:04:47,758 --> 01:04:48,997
- That's nice. - Yes.

1344
01:04:49,828 --> 01:04:51,598
Because I couldn't do that in the past.

1345
01:04:52,038 --> 01:04:53,797
I took them for granted.

1346
01:04:54,167 --> 01:04:55,968
I wanted them to know how I felt even if I didn't say anything.

1347
01:04:57,138 --> 01:04:58,437
- Why? - What?

1348
01:04:59,578 --> 01:05:00,578
I think you're right.

1349
01:05:00,579 --> 01:05:02,206
- You think I'm right? - I understand you.

1350
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:03,477
- You understand me? - Yes.

1351
01:05:03,977 --> 01:05:05,448
I think you're doing well.

1352
01:05:05,718 --> 01:05:07,747
- Doing what well? - Your sister.

1353
01:05:08,147 --> 01:05:09,187
- Ju Yeon? - Yes.

1354
01:05:09,917 --> 01:05:14,456
Is there someone close...

1355
01:05:14,457 --> 01:05:17,587
who understands how you feel?

1356
01:05:18,658 --> 01:05:19,658
- Me? - Yes.

1357
01:05:21,227 --> 01:05:22,468
I think...

1358
01:05:24,598 --> 01:05:25,936
I'm the understanding one.

1359
01:05:25,937 --> 01:05:27,397
Right? It seems like it.

1360
01:05:29,008 --> 01:05:30,937
But I don't dislike it being that way.

1361
01:05:31,337 --> 01:05:32,408
You don't dislike it?

1362
01:05:32,808 --> 01:05:33,837
That's possible.

1363
01:05:36,877 --> 01:05:39,476
I said I don't have expectations...

1364
01:05:39,477 --> 01:05:40,817
- I know. - about people.

1365
01:05:41,118 --> 01:05:44,017
I don't expect them to understand me.

1366
01:05:44,488 --> 01:05:47,218
I don't expect it from them.

1367
01:05:47,718 --> 01:05:51,357
It seems better for both of us...

1368
01:05:51,558 --> 01:05:53,127
when I take a stance of trying to understand them.

1369
01:05:54,598 --> 01:05:55,698
Of course, it has side effects.

1370
01:05:55,797 --> 01:05:59,267
Sometimes, I cry at the most ridiculous moment.

1371
01:06:02,607 --> 01:06:06,138
Because everyone wants to be understood.

1372
01:06:06,778 --> 01:06:11,107
It might've become that way because you gave up at some point...

1373
01:06:11,508 --> 01:06:14,278
and chose a different role.

1374
01:06:14,377 --> 01:06:16,587
As you play the role,

1375
01:06:17,488 --> 01:06:18,587
you get used to it...

1376
01:06:18,917 --> 01:06:22,528
and don't expect anything more than that.

1377
01:06:22,658 --> 01:06:25,697
You're the eldest son, and I'm the eldest daughter.

1378
01:06:25,698 --> 01:06:28,357
There are certain things we feel because of our role.

1379
01:06:29,567 --> 01:06:30,968
If there are more moments...

1380
01:06:32,098 --> 01:06:35,706
when you're understood,

1381
01:06:35,707 --> 01:06:37,138
it'd be...

1382
01:06:42,747 --> 01:06:44,376
You think it'd be good for me?

1383
01:06:44,377 --> 01:06:46,848
Yes. That's how I feel.

1384
01:06:47,747 --> 01:06:50,587
In a way, it's probably because I'm not good at it.

1385
01:06:50,687 --> 01:06:52,618
Maybe I'm not good at playing a different role.

1386
01:06:53,917 --> 01:06:56,558
But you don't seem like it,

1387
01:06:56,857 --> 01:06:58,087
which is quite interesting.

1388
01:06:59,497 --> 01:07:01,657
When you ride a pedal boat, you should pedal hard.

1389
01:07:01,658 --> 01:07:03,797
Is that so? That's amazing.

1390
01:07:05,167 --> 01:07:06,368
But I like to pedal.

1391
01:07:06,767 --> 01:07:07,767
I see.

1392
01:07:07,768 --> 01:07:10,266
When we were together,

1393
01:07:10,267 --> 01:07:12,067
there were more serious moments...

1394
01:07:12,638 --> 01:07:16,977
when we had a serious conversation rather than fun moments.

1395
01:07:17,508 --> 01:07:22,317
The romantic tension between us...

1396
01:07:22,618 --> 01:07:24,147
has lessened a bit.

1397
01:07:24,247 --> 01:07:26,817
I think it became like that at such moments,

1398
01:07:27,488 --> 01:07:29,288
which made me...

1399
01:07:29,988 --> 01:07:31,528
feel bad.

1400
01:07:32,627 --> 01:07:33,928
It's difficult.

1401
01:07:34,627 --> 01:07:36,566
Having fun is important too.

1402
01:07:36,567 --> 01:07:37,627
- It's important. - Yes.

1403
01:07:37,997 --> 01:07:41,496
What Cho A was trying to say was she could be someone...

1404
01:07:41,497 --> 01:07:43,106
- who understands him. - Right.

1405
01:07:43,107 --> 01:07:44,836
"I know you well."

1406
01:07:44,837 --> 01:07:46,606
"I know your pain and struggles."

1407
01:07:46,607 --> 01:07:49,376
"So I think I can make you happy."

1408
01:07:49,377 --> 01:07:50,678
That's what she was trying to say.

1409
01:07:50,908 --> 01:07:54,417
But it became a serious conversation.

1410
01:07:54,917 --> 01:07:56,617
They have different points of view about relationships.

1411
01:07:56,618 --> 01:07:59,417
Cho A wants to heal his wound...

1412
01:07:59,788 --> 01:08:00,917
and comfort him.

1413
01:08:01,118 --> 01:08:04,427
And Yong Woo wants to have fun with his date.

1414
01:08:07,357 --> 01:08:09,328
- Let's get some fresh air. - Let's do that.

1415
01:08:09,427 --> 01:08:12,936
- I think it'll be pretty... - Yes.

1416
01:08:12,937 --> 01:08:13,967
- over the bridge over there. - Yes.

1417
01:08:14,637 --> 01:08:17,607
(They decided to go for a walk across the river.)

1418
01:08:19,107 --> 01:08:23,147
I never thought our performance in that shabby place...

1419
01:08:23,748 --> 01:08:24,847
would have a butterfly effect,

1420
01:08:25,408 --> 01:08:26,617
leading to our date here.

1421
01:08:26,618 --> 01:08:27,647
I know.

1422
01:08:28,647 --> 01:08:30,017
I didn't expect it at all.

1423
01:08:30,118 --> 01:08:32,088
It's because you won at that time.

1424
01:08:33,158 --> 01:08:34,957
Thank you for choosing me.

1425
01:08:34,958 --> 01:08:37,828
That's why we can spend this time together.

1426
01:08:38,328 --> 01:08:40,028
I think I should thank you for voting for me.

1427
01:08:41,198 --> 01:08:43,998
I might've not voted for you.

1428
01:08:46,298 --> 01:08:49,368
What? You should have.

1429
01:08:50,408 --> 01:08:52,337
I thought you would've voted for me.

1430
01:08:52,338 --> 01:08:53,338
Yes.

1431
01:09:01,817 --> 01:09:03,788
- This is incredible. - I know.

1432
01:09:12,357 --> 01:09:13,657
It's interesting...

1433
01:09:13,658 --> 01:09:16,227
that we're having a conversation like this in a place like this.

1434
01:09:18,328 --> 01:09:21,698
Right? You don't really talk about what's in your heart, do you?

1435
01:09:22,067 --> 01:09:24,408
People usually don't. Is it just me?

1436
01:09:25,007 --> 01:09:26,908
I don't know.

1437
01:09:27,637 --> 01:09:29,607
I just like listening to your story.

1438
01:09:39,057 --> 01:09:41,617
Do you like to talk to someone...

1439
01:09:41,618 --> 01:09:43,788
or do you prefer...

1440
01:09:44,757 --> 01:09:47,198
to organize your thoughts by yourself?

1441
01:09:47,557 --> 01:09:50,197
I usually organize my thoughts by myself.

1442
01:09:50,198 --> 01:09:51,198
Right?

1443
01:09:51,567 --> 01:09:53,636
Even when there's something I want to know, I don't usually ask.

1444
01:09:53,637 --> 01:09:54,637
I've asked before,

1445
01:09:55,567 --> 01:09:58,838
but I feel a little shy about having a conversation...

1446
01:09:59,177 --> 01:10:00,838
although it might be good.

1447
01:10:01,177 --> 01:10:02,647
So I sometimes don't bring it up.

1448
01:10:03,278 --> 01:10:04,747
People are all different like that.

1449
01:10:04,748 --> 01:10:05,748
Right.

1450
01:10:06,118 --> 01:10:08,378
I think that's why it's not so easy.

1451
01:10:09,887 --> 01:10:11,048
Knowing the boundaries isn't easy.

1452
01:10:12,687 --> 01:10:14,917
The night view was beautiful.

1453
01:10:14,918 --> 01:10:18,157
And it felt like we were really on a date.

1454
01:10:18,158 --> 01:10:20,628
It was the first time I felt...

1455
01:10:20,828 --> 01:10:24,198
that we were sharing the same moment.

1456
01:10:26,038 --> 01:10:28,067
Our conversation was getting deeper.

1457
01:10:29,208 --> 01:10:30,408
I did feel comfortable.

1458
01:10:30,708 --> 01:10:33,038
Rather than the conversation being heavy,

1459
01:10:33,137 --> 01:10:36,477
I felt like our romantic tension was diminishing.

1460
01:10:36,748 --> 01:10:39,476
Maybe that's why...

1461
01:10:39,477 --> 01:10:41,017
I had many thoughts.

1462
01:10:44,887 --> 01:10:48,257
I thought our date was over.

1463
01:10:48,988 --> 01:10:51,457
For the first time, I felt a strange emptiness.

1464
01:10:51,458 --> 01:10:54,097
(He felt empty for some reason.)

1465
01:10:58,427 --> 01:10:59,937
They extended the date twice.

1466
01:11:00,137 --> 01:11:01,868
I wonder what they're doing.

1467
01:11:02,307 --> 01:11:04,106
I was a little uncomfortable around Cho A at first.

1468
01:11:04,107 --> 01:11:05,907
Since Thursday, she's been mellow...

1469
01:11:05,908 --> 01:11:08,106
- and bubbly. - Right.

1470
01:11:08,107 --> 01:11:10,177
- She's definitely more relaxed... - Yes.

1471
01:11:10,748 --> 01:11:12,448
because I got to talk to her a lot.

1472
01:11:12,748 --> 01:11:14,418
When she was going to eat,

1473
01:11:14,717 --> 01:11:16,647
I was like, "Let me heat it up while you're doing something else."

1474
01:11:17,088 --> 01:11:18,947
(The last day in Seoul)

1475
01:11:18,948 --> 01:11:20,958
(Cho A wants to eat the kimchi fried rice Yun Jae made.)

1476
01:11:21,057 --> 01:11:23,357
(Yun Jae sees it.)

1477
01:11:24,458 --> 01:11:26,896
Let me heat it up. You can just do other things.

1478
01:11:26,897 --> 01:11:28,327
You're so kind.

1479
01:11:28,328 --> 01:11:29,927
I'm so happy.

1480
01:11:30,668 --> 01:11:32,637
I wanted to eat so much.

1481
01:11:33,838 --> 01:11:38,107
I would've been in trouble if it weren't for you.

1482
01:11:39,637 --> 01:11:40,908
She's so nice.

1483
01:11:41,408 --> 01:11:44,078
I'm not joking. It's fun just to see her walking.

1484
01:11:46,017 --> 01:11:47,447
- She's so graceful. - She walks quietly.

1485
01:11:47,448 --> 01:11:48,716
She walks quietly and gracefully.

1486
01:11:48,717 --> 01:11:51,288
You know why I say it's fun, right?

1487
01:11:51,748 --> 01:11:52,757
- My sister? - Yes.

1488
01:11:53,687 --> 01:11:54,687
They're here.

1489
01:11:55,317 --> 01:11:56,328
Who would it be?

1490
01:11:57,057 --> 01:12:01,128
(Who came first?)

1491
01:12:03,198 --> 01:12:06,668
(Se Seung and Jung Sub have arrived.)

1492
01:12:06,868 --> 01:12:09,607
We're the first ones, Jung Sub.

1493
01:12:09,937 --> 01:12:13,307
Jung Sub who wanted to end the date faster than anyone else.

1494
01:12:13,507 --> 01:12:15,307
(His sister fell asleep while waiting for him.)

1495
01:12:15,538 --> 01:12:17,006
What's this?

1496
01:12:17,007 --> 01:12:19,647
- Why? Let me see it too. - Hurry up.

1497
01:12:19,748 --> 01:12:22,787
Jung Sub, I think there's a swimming pool.

1498
01:12:22,788 --> 01:12:23,788
It sounds like Se Seung.

1499
01:12:24,918 --> 01:12:26,187
Put these things here.

1500
01:12:27,217 --> 01:12:29,427
I wanted to wake Yun Ha up and bring her quickly.

1501
01:12:29,588 --> 01:12:31,256
- Hurry up. Yun Ha. - Yes?

1502
01:12:31,257 --> 01:12:32,288
Which room would you like to choose?

1503
01:12:32,597 --> 01:12:34,096
- Jung Sub is here. - He's here?

1504
01:12:34,097 --> 01:12:35,967
Hurry up and lie down. I'll bring him.

1505
01:12:41,097 --> 01:12:42,137
Who is it?

1506
01:12:42,467 --> 01:12:43,538
Hello.

1507
01:12:44,507 --> 01:12:46,637
- What's this? - You look very happy.

1508
01:12:47,708 --> 01:12:49,976
This is crazy.

1509
01:12:49,977 --> 01:12:50,977
Hello.

1510
01:12:50,978 --> 01:12:52,278
Look at this.

1511
01:12:58,748 --> 01:13:00,386
- Jung Sub. - Yes.

1512
01:13:00,387 --> 01:13:01,988
Hurry up. Come quickly.

1513
01:13:02,088 --> 01:13:03,887
- You want me to go upstairs? - Come quickly.

1514
01:13:03,988 --> 01:13:05,127
- Hurry up. - Why?

1515
01:13:05,128 --> 01:13:06,596
- Why? Hurry up and run? - Hurry up and run.

1516
01:13:06,597 --> 01:13:08,396
- What's going on? - Run.

1517
01:13:08,397 --> 01:13:09,397
- What is it? - Run quickly.

1518
01:13:09,398 --> 01:13:10,726
- Lie down. - What's going on?

1519
01:13:10,727 --> 01:13:11,997
- Lie down? - What? Lie down?

1520
01:13:11,998 --> 01:13:13,197
- Hurry up and run. - Jung Sub!

1521
01:13:13,198 --> 01:13:15,066
- Hurry up, Jung Sub! - Run quickly.

1522
01:13:15,067 --> 01:13:16,167
What's going on?

1523
01:13:16,168 --> 01:13:17,708
Hurry up. Lie down.

1524
01:13:17,807 --> 01:13:19,136
- Lie down quickly. - Hurry up and lie down.

1525
01:13:19,137 --> 01:13:20,177
- Lie down. - Lie down.

1526
01:13:20,807 --> 01:13:23,578
(Yun Ha and Jung Sub picked Room 2 on the 2nd floor.)

1527
01:13:23,908 --> 01:13:24,977
He told them to lie down quickly.

1528
01:13:25,278 --> 01:13:26,577
It's confirmed.

1529
01:13:26,578 --> 01:13:29,187
Yun Jae is no joke.

1530
01:13:29,288 --> 01:13:31,087
- He's so reliable. - He...

1531
01:13:31,088 --> 01:13:34,287
is playing the perfect boyfriend role.

1532
01:13:34,288 --> 01:13:36,327
- You're absolutely right. - Yes.

1533
01:13:36,328 --> 01:13:38,387
He only cares about his girl.

1534
01:13:38,588 --> 01:13:41,327
He cooks, keeps the house well, and cleans well.

1535
01:13:41,328 --> 01:13:42,596
- And he's funny. - He's funny.

1536
01:13:42,597 --> 01:13:44,027
- And he's not nervous anymore. - He's straightforward too.

1537
01:13:44,028 --> 01:13:45,998
- Right. - I wished he hadn't.

1538
01:13:46,437 --> 01:13:49,867
- I became his fan. He's fun. - Sorry?

1539
01:13:49,868 --> 01:13:50,868
Lie down.

1540
01:13:50,869 --> 01:13:52,207
- Lie down quickly. - Hurry up and lie down.

1541
01:13:52,208 --> 01:13:53,238
- Lie down. - Lie down.

1542
01:13:53,738 --> 01:13:56,177
(Yun Ha and Jung Sub picked Room 2 on the 2nd floor.)

1543
01:13:56,548 --> 01:13:58,977
- You can't pick this room anyway. - Why? What is this about?

1544
01:13:59,078 --> 01:14:01,117
This room is so nice.

1545
01:14:01,118 --> 01:14:03,186
It's crazy.

1546
01:14:03,187 --> 01:14:04,816
- What's this? - Did someone pick it already?

1547
01:14:04,817 --> 01:14:06,987
- Can we do this? - What's this?

1548
01:14:06,988 --> 01:14:08,387
- Can we do this? - What's going on?

1549
01:14:09,357 --> 01:14:11,328
Is it okay to do this?

1550
01:14:12,597 --> 01:14:14,357
- Gosh, this is crazy. - I didn't see it.

1551
01:14:14,458 --> 01:14:17,226
Yun Jae was like, "Hurry up and go to your sister."

1552
01:14:17,227 --> 01:14:18,426
I went to her,

1553
01:14:18,427 --> 01:14:21,837
and we could pick the best room that was perfect for us.

1554
01:14:21,838 --> 01:14:22,838
It was so nice.

1555
01:14:23,107 --> 01:14:26,307
I think Yun Jae was considerate of us.

1556
01:14:28,607 --> 01:14:31,247
Jung Sub is Yun Ha's brother.

1557
01:14:31,248 --> 01:14:33,418
Of course, I thought I should leave a good impression on him.

1558
01:14:33,517 --> 01:14:34,577
"In Singapore,"

1559
01:14:34,578 --> 01:14:37,118
"you will share a room with your sibling."

1560
01:14:37,217 --> 01:14:38,988
"It's 1st come, 1st served for room assignments."

1561
01:14:39,118 --> 01:14:40,557
(He understands why he had to run at full speed.)

1562
01:14:41,158 --> 01:14:42,458
High-five.

1563
01:14:43,828 --> 01:14:45,556
How many rooms are there?

1564
01:14:45,557 --> 01:14:47,957
- There are 4. - There are 4 rooms?

1565
01:14:47,958 --> 01:14:49,697
- Yes. We searched everywhere, - There are four rooms?

1566
01:14:49,698 --> 01:14:51,368
and there are four rooms only.

1567
01:14:51,828 --> 01:14:54,437
(Se Seung checks it herself.)

1568
01:14:54,897 --> 01:14:57,467
This room isn't nice.

1569
01:14:58,168 --> 01:15:00,408
I can't share it with my brother.

1570
01:15:00,507 --> 01:15:02,676
I found another room.

1571
01:15:02,677 --> 01:15:03,677
Where is it?

1572
01:15:03,748 --> 01:15:05,807
There's a secret door on the third floor.

1573
01:15:05,918 --> 01:15:07,647
And you didn't tell us until now?

1574
01:15:07,748 --> 01:15:10,288
I found it before I went to bed earlier.

1575
01:15:10,488 --> 01:15:11,887
(Yun Ha was walking around by herself.)

1576
01:15:12,317 --> 01:15:15,687
There was a huge door on the third floor.

1577
01:15:18,288 --> 01:15:22,257
There was a really cool space behind it.

1578
01:15:22,998 --> 01:15:26,097
(She opens the huge door.)

1579
01:15:29,238 --> 01:15:30,267
It opens.

1580
01:15:32,908 --> 01:15:35,637
(The last room hidden on the 3rd floor)

1581
01:15:37,378 --> 01:15:40,048
(Room 2 on the 3rd floor)

1582
01:15:44,548 --> 01:15:48,517
(Room 1 and Room 2 on the 3rd floor are divided by the door.)

1583
01:15:49,588 --> 01:15:52,327
(There's a bathroom,)

1584
01:15:52,328 --> 01:15:53,756
(a powder room,)

1585
01:15:53,757 --> 01:15:57,698
(and a dressing room inside.)

1586
01:16:00,597 --> 01:16:03,637
(There's a big terrace shared with Room 1.)

1587
01:16:06,578 --> 01:16:07,607
What's this?

1588
01:16:08,677 --> 01:16:09,908
Can I switch rooms?

1589
01:16:11,147 --> 01:16:12,717
There's a bathtub too.

1590
01:16:13,878 --> 01:16:16,847
(Meanwhile, someone is coming.)

1591
01:16:17,788 --> 01:16:18,887
They're here.

1592
01:16:18,988 --> 01:16:20,356
- They're here. - They're here?

1593
01:16:20,357 --> 01:16:22,756
(Cho A and Yong Woo have arrived.)

1594
01:16:22,757 --> 01:16:23,757
It's Cheol Hyeon.

1595
01:16:25,128 --> 01:16:26,397
Why is the house so nice?

1596
01:16:28,998 --> 01:16:30,067
They've come.

1597
01:16:32,528 --> 01:16:33,597
What's this?

1598
01:16:34,798 --> 01:16:35,838
- It's seriously so nice. - Right?

1599
01:16:36,368 --> 01:16:38,437
- Welcome. - Hi, guys.

1600
01:16:39,738 --> 01:16:40,976
- Did you have fun? - Yes.

1601
01:16:40,977 --> 01:16:44,176
- Gosh, what's this? - You guys extended your date twice.

1602
01:16:44,177 --> 01:16:45,177
Oh, my gosh.

1603
01:16:45,178 --> 01:16:47,418
(Se Seung is immersed in playing with a toy.)

1604
01:16:48,317 --> 01:16:50,817
- What? It's a bubble machine. - What's that?

1605
01:16:51,347 --> 01:16:52,488
It's not a camera.

1606
01:16:52,588 --> 01:16:55,158
What? My gosh.

1607
01:16:55,357 --> 01:16:56,627
(She saw Yong Woo only now.)

1608
01:16:56,628 --> 01:16:57,727
Oh, my gosh.

1609
01:16:59,088 --> 01:17:00,158
(Frozen)

1610
01:17:00,257 --> 01:17:01,357
Why isn't Jae Hyung coming?

1611
01:17:02,227 --> 01:17:05,198
Gosh, this is crazy.

1612
01:17:05,597 --> 01:17:07,266
(Devastated)

1613
01:17:07,267 --> 01:17:08,497
- Oh, my. - It's a fight...

1614
01:17:08,498 --> 01:17:09,737
between Lee Ju Yeon and Park Jae Hyung.

1615
01:17:09,738 --> 01:17:12,168
- Why? - You know nothing.

1616
01:17:12,538 --> 01:17:13,538
He looks bright and innocent.

1617
01:17:13,539 --> 01:17:15,606
You know nothing.

1618
01:17:15,607 --> 01:17:17,607
He looks bright and innocent.

1619
01:17:17,807 --> 01:17:19,517
Why are they so late?

1620
01:17:20,347 --> 01:17:21,647
Why do they have so many things to do?

1621
01:17:23,288 --> 01:17:24,548
I wanted Jae Hyung to come quickly.

1622
01:17:26,488 --> 01:17:27,657
How about something like this?

1623
01:17:27,658 --> 01:17:28,788
(They're dating without knowing anything.)

1624
01:17:28,958 --> 01:17:30,458
- Something like this? - It looks nice.

1625
01:17:31,257 --> 01:17:32,357
Try it.

1626
01:17:38,998 --> 01:17:40,067
Nice.

1627
01:17:44,338 --> 01:17:46,477
- You look like a model. - Nice.

1628
01:17:46,578 --> 01:17:47,838
I want to take a picture together.

1629
01:17:47,937 --> 01:17:48,937
Let's do that.

1630
01:17:59,088 --> 01:18:01,857
Shall we go to the tree?

1631
01:18:03,458 --> 01:18:04,458
(Shouting)

1632
01:18:04,458 --> 01:18:05,458
(Surprised)

1633
01:18:05,828 --> 01:18:07,726
Are you all right? Let's sit first.

1634
01:18:07,727 --> 01:18:09,057
- It hurts. - Let's sit first.

1635
01:18:09,967 --> 01:18:11,767
- I'm bleeding. - Are you bleeding?

1636
01:18:13,868 --> 01:18:16,307
Wait. We should go.

1637
01:18:17,067 --> 01:18:18,107
I have alcohol.

1638
01:18:20,208 --> 01:18:21,738
Let me pour it a little.

1639
01:18:22,408 --> 01:18:24,778
(He rinses her foot with water first.)

1640
01:18:26,778 --> 01:18:27,918
(Groaning)

1641
01:18:31,088 --> 01:18:33,657
(He wraps the scrape first.)

1642
01:18:33,658 --> 01:18:34,658
Wait.

1643
01:18:34,918 --> 01:18:37,588
You don't have to press it.

1644
01:18:42,868 --> 01:18:43,927
It hurts so much.

1645
01:18:44,897 --> 01:18:45,897
Gosh.

1646
01:18:51,838 --> 01:18:54,106
We should disinfect the scrape quickly.

1647
01:18:54,107 --> 01:18:55,378
Can you the alcohol one more time?

1648
01:18:55,838 --> 01:18:57,208
Yes. I sent that we will end the date.

1649
01:18:57,477 --> 01:18:59,548
There's an emergency kit there.

1650
01:19:01,317 --> 01:19:03,418
I didn't know how deep the wound was.

1651
01:19:03,847 --> 01:19:07,057
So I thought we should go immediately.

1652
01:19:07,418 --> 01:19:09,857
I hurt my foot, but it was really nice.

1653
01:19:10,757 --> 01:19:11,887
Am I the only one who thought like that?

1654
01:19:12,788 --> 01:19:13,897
It was perfect.

1655
01:19:14,328 --> 01:19:15,328
My gosh.

1656
01:19:15,329 --> 01:19:18,128
You hurt yourself as soon as we came because something good will happen.

1657
01:19:18,698 --> 01:19:21,767
(The house in Singapore)

1658
01:19:21,967 --> 01:19:23,407
Ju Yeon and Jae Hyung...

1659
01:19:23,408 --> 01:19:26,006
have no reason to date until this late.

1660
01:19:26,007 --> 01:19:27,538
I guess they're having fun.

1661
01:19:27,908 --> 01:19:30,177
"Where's the room?" I couldn't find it until the end.

1662
01:19:30,278 --> 01:19:31,976
This is the room. You can do yoga here.

1663
01:19:31,977 --> 01:19:33,077
Oh, my gosh.

1664
01:19:33,078 --> 01:19:35,016
When I saw the terrace for the first time,

1665
01:19:35,017 --> 01:19:38,247
I thought it'd be so nice to do yoga there.

1666
01:19:38,248 --> 01:19:40,457
It'd be more comfortable to do yoga when we wake up...

1667
01:19:40,458 --> 01:19:41,556
- if we use this room. - Right.

1668
01:19:41,557 --> 01:19:44,426
People on the third floor would have to share the bathroom over there.

1669
01:19:44,427 --> 01:19:46,027
There's a powder room...

1670
01:19:46,028 --> 01:19:47,726
- There's a toilet. - where you can use the toilet...

1671
01:19:47,727 --> 01:19:49,157
- Right. - and wash your face.

1672
01:19:49,158 --> 01:19:50,798
It'd be better to use this room.

1673
01:19:50,998 --> 01:19:52,727
- Because when we wake up, - Yes.

1674
01:19:52,828 --> 01:19:54,467
- we can do yoga here. - Right.

1675
01:19:54,767 --> 01:19:57,538
(They've finally come.)

1676
01:20:00,007 --> 01:20:02,337
(Ju Yeon and Jae Hyung have arrived.)

1677
01:20:02,338 --> 01:20:03,548
(Exclaiming)

1678
01:20:04,878 --> 01:20:07,347
- There's a swimming pool. - Where?

1679
01:20:08,078 --> 01:20:09,078
Oh, my.

1680
01:20:10,147 --> 01:20:11,417
- Someone is here. - They came?

1681
01:20:11,418 --> 01:20:13,257
- They came. - Jae Hyung...

1682
01:20:13,357 --> 01:20:14,887
- Jae Hyung! - Jae Hyung...

1683
01:20:15,557 --> 01:20:16,658
Jae Hyung!

1684
01:20:17,158 --> 01:20:18,857
You should think quickly.

1685
01:20:18,958 --> 01:20:21,958
Hurry up. You have less time than you think.

1686
01:20:22,498 --> 01:20:24,926
- Hurry up. - "Siblings should enter..."

1687
01:20:24,927 --> 01:20:27,497
- "the room to..." - Hurry up and go with me.

1688
01:20:27,498 --> 01:20:28,697
- Okay. - Where's my brother?

1689
01:20:28,698 --> 01:20:31,106
- I'm here. - Use the room you want.

1690
01:20:31,107 --> 01:20:33,077
We're late already.

1691
01:20:33,078 --> 01:20:35,007
Why do I not have slippers?

1692
01:20:35,107 --> 01:20:36,778
That's not important.

1693
01:20:36,878 --> 01:20:39,717
Look. The good rooms are occupied already.

1694
01:20:39,817 --> 01:20:41,747
- It's either here or... - What's this?

1695
01:20:41,748 --> 01:20:43,787
Let me tell you about good things and bad things about this room.

1696
01:20:43,788 --> 01:20:44,788
It's either here or where?

1697
01:20:44,789 --> 01:20:46,356
It's a very small room,

1698
01:20:46,357 --> 01:20:48,917
- but there's a shower room. - I want to use this room then.

1699
01:20:48,918 --> 01:20:50,527
It's small, but has a shower room.

1700
01:20:50,528 --> 01:20:52,356
- I don't mind using a small room. - The second room is upstairs.

1701
01:20:52,357 --> 01:20:53,357
Let's go up.

1702
01:20:53,358 --> 01:20:54,927
- What's this? - But if you use this room...

1703
01:20:55,028 --> 01:20:56,157
If you use this room...

1704
01:20:56,158 --> 01:20:58,498
This is a hidden ace.

1705
01:20:59,198 --> 01:21:01,538
- Gosh, this is crazy. - I know.

1706
01:21:01,798 --> 01:21:03,467
There's a dressing room.

1707
01:21:03,937 --> 01:21:06,106
- We'd like to use this room. - There's a bathtub too.

1708
01:21:06,107 --> 01:21:07,107
- There's no hanger. - You want to use this room?

1709
01:21:07,108 --> 01:21:08,476
- No. Don't trust me. - No.

1710
01:21:08,477 --> 01:21:09,537
- Let's use this room. - Let's use this room.

1711
01:21:09,538 --> 01:21:11,106
- Use this room. - Do you want to use the other room?

1712
01:21:11,107 --> 01:21:13,948
(Yong Woo and Ju Yeon picked Room 2 on the 3rd floor.)

1713
01:21:14,248 --> 01:21:16,346
Ju Yeon, people will walk around here a lot.

1714
01:21:16,347 --> 01:21:18,948
That's what you pay for giving up the room on the second floor.

1715
01:21:19,048 --> 01:21:20,817
I didn't give it up.

1716
01:21:20,918 --> 01:21:22,557
I chose with you.

1717
01:21:22,717 --> 01:21:25,357
You should've said you wanted to use the room on the second floor.

1718
01:21:25,658 --> 01:21:26,658
It happened already anyway.

1719
01:21:27,828 --> 01:21:29,897
- Whose room is this? - Yun Jae and Ji Won.

1720
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:31,797
But why...

1721
01:21:31,798 --> 01:21:33,137
Why did you come so late?

1722
01:21:33,238 --> 01:21:36,168
I thought everyone would extend their date. Why didn't they do it?

1723
01:21:36,437 --> 01:21:37,868
We extended our date too.

1724
01:21:38,738 --> 01:21:40,708
This is nice, though. I like it.

1725
01:21:41,137 --> 01:21:43,248
It's not a bed.

1726
01:21:43,347 --> 01:21:44,477
I don't need a bed.

1727
01:21:44,748 --> 01:21:45,748
But the air conditioner...

1728
01:21:45,749 --> 01:21:46,948
- should be on. - The air conditioner?

1729
01:21:47,378 --> 01:21:49,176
It's summer here. It's 30°C. We should turn it on.

1730
01:21:49,177 --> 01:21:50,748
I feel cold already.

1731
01:21:51,048 --> 01:21:53,687
It seemed Se Seung preferred the room upstairs...

1732
01:21:53,788 --> 01:21:56,256
because our room didn't have a bed.

1733
01:21:56,257 --> 01:21:58,288
But I like sleeping on the floor.

1734
01:21:59,257 --> 01:22:01,897
We got to use...

1735
01:22:02,458 --> 01:22:05,267
a tiny room.

1736
01:22:05,368 --> 01:22:08,667
As my brother said, it seemed better to have our own bathroom.

1737
01:22:08,668 --> 01:22:10,567
So I said okay.

1738
01:22:10,767 --> 01:22:14,738
(They finished choosing their rooms.)

1739
01:22:15,208 --> 01:22:17,248
This is so soft and nice.

1740
01:22:18,647 --> 01:22:20,618
Everyone seems to like plushies.

1741
01:22:22,118 --> 01:22:23,118
(A doorbell rang.)

1742
01:22:23,118 --> 01:22:24,118
- They do it here too? - Oh, gosh.

1743
01:22:25,248 --> 01:22:27,387
- I like it. - Hello. Come down.

1744
01:22:27,988 --> 01:22:29,458
- I'll go. - Okay.

1745
01:22:30,128 --> 01:22:31,488
Please come down.

1746
01:22:35,158 --> 01:22:37,498
(A letter has arrived.)

1747
01:22:37,727 --> 01:22:39,667
- I don't think she can hear it. - I don't think she can hear it.

1748
01:22:39,668 --> 01:22:40,668
Come down.

1749
01:22:41,298 --> 01:22:42,838
We have an envelope.

1750
01:22:43,137 --> 01:22:44,637
- Cho A. - Yes.

1751
01:22:44,738 --> 01:22:46,677
You should come down.

1752
01:22:47,238 --> 01:22:48,538
Ta-da.

1753
01:22:49,908 --> 01:22:51,177
- Come down. - Oh, yes.

1754
01:22:51,778 --> 01:22:53,118
Everyone gathered after a while.

1755
01:22:54,217 --> 01:22:55,847
- What is it? - Did you see it?

1756
01:22:56,177 --> 01:22:57,187
What is it?

1757
01:22:57,588 --> 01:22:59,988
"Five days before the final selection day."

1758
01:23:00,618 --> 01:23:01,816
(5 days before the final selection day)

1759
01:23:01,817 --> 01:23:03,657
(Female participants will choose their date tomorrow.)

1760
01:23:03,658 --> 01:23:05,527
(Send us the name of the man you would like to go out with.)

1761
01:23:05,528 --> 01:23:09,457
(Make a final decision after discussing with your sibling.)

1762
01:23:09,458 --> 01:23:10,498
Why is it five days before?

1763
01:23:11,498 --> 01:23:12,627
- Look at this. - Oh, my gosh.

1764
01:23:12,628 --> 01:23:15,067
There's not much time left than I thought.

1765
01:23:15,897 --> 01:23:19,977
(They each send the name of the one they want to go on a date with.)

1766
01:23:26,618 --> 01:23:27,618
Did you send it?

1767
01:23:28,448 --> 01:23:29,448
Did you send it?

1768
01:23:30,088 --> 01:23:32,217
So this is how it feels. It's scary.

1769
01:23:32,647 --> 01:23:34,757
- I've never done this before. - Right.

1770
01:23:36,658 --> 01:23:38,658
Clink my glass too. My arm's going numb.

1771
01:23:39,088 --> 01:23:40,128
Your arm's going numb?

1772
01:23:41,958 --> 01:23:44,767
(The women have finished deciding.)

1773
01:23:45,727 --> 01:23:46,798
Can I try your hat on?

1774
01:23:47,368 --> 01:23:48,497
- It's my sister's. - I want to try it on.

1775
01:23:48,498 --> 01:23:50,637
Right, it's Ji Won's. I was just curious about it.

1776
01:23:51,838 --> 01:23:52,867
I wanted to try this on.

1777
01:23:52,868 --> 01:23:53,878
(It goes on smoothly.)

1778
01:23:54,477 --> 01:23:55,477
I wanted to try this on.

1779
01:23:55,838 --> 01:23:57,106
(It doesn't fit him.)

1780
01:23:57,107 --> 01:23:58,448
- He has a small head. - It looks good on you.

1781
01:23:59,107 --> 01:24:01,578
- My head can't breathe. - Yours is big on him.

1782
01:24:01,677 --> 01:24:02,948
Yours is big on him.

1783
01:24:03,048 --> 01:24:04,048
This is so shocking.

1784
01:24:05,217 --> 01:24:06,917
- Give me your head. - I feel like...

1785
01:24:06,918 --> 01:24:08,658
- It's not. - I feel like mine's going to break.

1786
01:24:08,757 --> 01:24:09,757
Yes, it might break.

1787
01:24:10,328 --> 01:24:11,328
(His hair is sticking out.)

1788
01:24:11,727 --> 01:24:13,628
I'm going to take it off. It hurts. It cut off my blood circulation.

1789
01:24:13,927 --> 01:24:16,328
- My... My head's quite small too. - This is nice.

1790
01:24:18,427 --> 01:24:20,338
- That's a nice hat. - It's hers.

1791
01:24:21,298 --> 01:24:23,038
Did you wear the sunglasses today, or not?

1792
01:24:23,437 --> 01:24:25,708
I wore them earlier, after choosing my room.

1793
01:24:26,708 --> 01:24:27,838
The rabbit's trying to escape.

1794
01:24:28,437 --> 01:24:29,778
- It's so funny. - The confidence of first place.

1795
01:24:31,807 --> 01:24:32,847
Yun Jae.

1796
01:24:33,418 --> 01:24:35,347
I want to eat kimchi fried rice again.

1797
01:24:35,618 --> 01:24:38,217
- Me too. - It was really good.

1798
01:24:38,418 --> 01:24:40,816
- I'll go grocery shopping tomorrow. - It was really that good?

1799
01:24:40,817 --> 01:24:43,387
Yes, it was so good that I...

1800
01:24:43,488 --> 01:24:44,686
- I didn't expect... - Wait, she's listening.

1801
01:24:44,687 --> 01:24:45,687
She's right here.

1802
01:24:45,688 --> 01:24:46,797
- Look at Yun Ha's face. - Look at her face.

1803
01:24:46,798 --> 01:24:49,198
Her eyes are moved to the side like this.

1804
01:24:50,567 --> 01:24:53,298
Yes, it was so good that I...

1805
01:24:53,397 --> 01:24:55,237
- What was so good? - Kimchi fried rice.

1806
01:24:55,238 --> 01:24:56,238
Kimchi fried rice?

1807
01:24:56,239 --> 01:24:58,307
- Did you use Mom's kimchi? - I used Mom's kimchi.

1808
01:25:01,107 --> 01:25:05,077
(Siblings, please go to each of your rooms.)

1809
01:25:05,078 --> 01:25:06,107
- Let's go. - Okay.

1810
01:25:06,578 --> 01:25:08,016
(The Kim siblings take alcohol with them.)

1811
01:25:08,017 --> 01:25:09,347
Bring the cups. I'll carry these.

1812
01:25:09,548 --> 01:25:10,618
Yun Ha, come in.

1813
01:25:12,017 --> 01:25:13,187
Don't eavesdrop.

1814
01:25:13,387 --> 01:25:16,788
- Cheol Hyeon, hurry up. - Okay.

1815
01:25:16,887 --> 01:25:18,957
Closing the door now.

1816
01:25:18,958 --> 01:25:20,397
(They're all in their separate rooms.)

1817
01:25:21,198 --> 01:25:23,727
(Yun Ha and Jung Sub's room)

1818
01:25:28,467 --> 01:25:29,636
(We will tell you the name of the woman who chose Jung Sub.)

1819
01:25:29,637 --> 01:25:31,006
(Siblings can have a discussion and can change who his date will be.)

1820
01:25:31,007 --> 01:25:32,367
(If more than one person chose him,)

1821
01:25:32,368 --> 01:25:33,707
(you can either choose one of them or change to someone else.)

1822
01:25:33,708 --> 01:25:35,307
We can change who your date is going to be...

1823
01:25:35,507 --> 01:25:36,908
after we discuss it.

1824
01:25:37,107 --> 01:25:38,347
We can change my date?

1825
01:25:38,578 --> 01:25:40,477
Yes, we can choose someone else completely.

1826
01:25:40,748 --> 01:25:42,878
Regardless of whoever chose you or not,

1827
01:25:42,977 --> 01:25:44,588
who you and I choose...

1828
01:25:44,988 --> 01:25:47,618
will decide who your date is going to be tomorrow.

1829
01:25:48,588 --> 01:25:51,588
(They've been given a chance to change their date.)

1830
01:25:51,757 --> 01:25:53,958
Why do you have everything scattered across the room?

1831
01:25:54,397 --> 01:25:56,028
- Let's clean up. - Sounds good.

1832
01:25:56,927 --> 01:25:59,467
(They start cleaning up first.)

1833
01:26:00,838 --> 01:26:01,897
We got messages.

1834
01:26:03,637 --> 01:26:05,707
(Ji Won and Ju Yeon chose you.)

1835
01:26:05,708 --> 01:26:06,878
What does it say? Who chose you?

1836
01:26:07,177 --> 01:26:10,177
(Ji Won and Ju Yeon chose your sibling.)

1837
01:26:10,448 --> 01:26:13,007
I knew it. Who are you going to choose?

1838
01:26:18,418 --> 01:26:19,448
You should go ahead with Ji Won.

1839
01:26:20,517 --> 01:26:21,618
How was it today?

1840
01:26:24,788 --> 01:26:26,896
- Are you cold? - Why?

1841
01:26:26,897 --> 01:26:27,958
I'm so hot.

1842
01:26:29,028 --> 01:26:30,927
- Or... - Give me something to wear.

1843
01:26:31,668 --> 01:26:32,828
I have to send the message?

1844
01:26:33,538 --> 01:26:35,868
No, how... We have to discuss it first.

1845
01:26:36,137 --> 01:26:37,708
- Ji Won? - Yes.

1846
01:26:38,538 --> 01:26:41,177
It's because I've never spoken to Ji Won at all,

1847
01:26:41,278 --> 01:26:42,337
- just the two of us. - Right. Yes.

1848
01:26:42,338 --> 01:26:43,476
You should talk to her.

1849
01:26:43,477 --> 01:26:46,278
But there are only five days left before the final choice.

1850
01:26:47,177 --> 01:26:50,288
Am I the only one who thinks the remaining time is too short?

1851
01:26:50,488 --> 01:26:52,288
I think the remaining time is too short too.

1852
01:26:52,548 --> 01:26:54,217
How was your date today?

1853
01:26:54,717 --> 01:26:56,587
It was... It was fun.

1854
01:26:56,588 --> 01:26:58,727
I feel like you get along well in terms of personality.

1855
01:26:59,057 --> 01:27:02,157
We might only get along in terms of personality.

1856
01:27:02,158 --> 01:27:04,627
- Right. - I need to feel drawn to her.

1857
01:27:04,628 --> 01:27:07,338
- Right. - But I don't.

1858
01:27:07,597 --> 01:27:08,597
Right.

1859
01:27:08,598 --> 01:27:13,038
But there are things that I can feel about the person...

1860
01:27:13,137 --> 01:27:14,538
How should I put this?

1861
01:27:14,977 --> 01:27:16,137
- You're sorry? - Yes.

1862
01:27:16,708 --> 01:27:17,708
(Sighing)

1863
01:27:17,709 --> 01:27:21,217
Why are the rooms all different?

1864
01:27:23,517 --> 01:27:26,186
You should have come sooner.

1865
01:27:26,187 --> 01:27:28,458
I'm going to use this bag.

1866
01:27:29,088 --> 01:27:30,628
(Laughing)

1867
01:27:34,498 --> 01:27:36,357
(Pretends to be cool)

1868
01:27:36,668 --> 01:27:38,668
(She's not even looking at him.)

1869
01:27:39,097 --> 01:27:42,168
But why did Ji Won choose me?

1870
01:27:42,698 --> 01:27:43,908
Ask her yourself.

1871
01:27:44,007 --> 01:27:45,807
I didn't feel anything like that from her.

1872
01:27:46,538 --> 01:27:47,878
(Ji Won)

1873
01:27:48,807 --> 01:27:50,847
- I sent it. - Good.

1874
01:27:51,307 --> 01:27:52,378
(Sighing)

1875
01:27:52,477 --> 01:27:53,477
(She feels uneasy after finishing the discussion.)

1876
01:27:53,478 --> 01:27:57,588
It's hard to figure things out even if we keep talking about them.

1877
01:27:58,387 --> 01:27:59,988
(Who did you choose as your date?)

1878
01:28:00,257 --> 01:28:01,257
Jung Sub.

1879
01:28:01,458 --> 01:28:04,028
I was a bit anxious...

1880
01:28:04,857 --> 01:28:07,958
since he could discuss it and choose someone else.

1881
01:28:08,257 --> 01:28:11,527
I feel like 50 to 60 percent of me...

1882
01:28:11,528 --> 01:28:13,567
always think he'll choose me,

1883
01:28:13,998 --> 01:28:16,637
but 40 percent of me...

1884
01:28:16,708 --> 01:28:18,908
is keeping possibilities open.

1885
01:28:19,137 --> 01:28:21,937
Even though we've already cleared all the misunderstandings.

1886
01:28:23,847 --> 01:28:25,208
I think I'm just weird.

1887
01:28:26,378 --> 01:28:28,677
(Yun Ha and Jung Sub's room)

1888
01:28:29,118 --> 01:28:30,147
Se Seung.

1889
01:28:31,288 --> 01:28:32,448
I'm fine with that.

1890
01:28:34,017 --> 01:28:35,418
Do you want to go with Ji Won?

1891
01:28:35,817 --> 01:28:36,828
No.

1892
01:28:37,557 --> 01:28:38,726
- Why not? - What?

1893
01:28:38,727 --> 01:28:39,727
Why not?

1894
01:28:39,728 --> 01:28:43,056
I spoke with Ji Won until 10am that time...

1895
01:28:43,057 --> 01:28:44,227
at the basement hideout.

1896
01:28:44,328 --> 01:28:47,136
So did you feel any tension toward her?

1897
01:28:47,137 --> 01:28:48,537
You must have felt it.

1898
01:28:48,538 --> 01:28:50,566
I can't say...

1899
01:28:50,567 --> 01:28:52,967
that I didn't feel that way.

1900
01:28:54,578 --> 01:28:56,476
- You're curious... - Wouldn't anyone feel that way...

1901
01:28:56,477 --> 01:28:58,548
- though? - You're curious about her.

1902
01:29:02,118 --> 01:29:05,017
I heard it ended up being like a bromance between you two.

1903
01:29:05,488 --> 01:29:06,488
With Ji Won?

1904
01:29:06,489 --> 01:29:08,057
- I talked to Ji Won today. - About what?

1905
01:29:08,387 --> 01:29:09,387
I told her things like...

1906
01:29:09,388 --> 01:29:12,028
how you usually dated women who were older than you,

1907
01:29:13,128 --> 01:29:16,967
and that even though she had drinks with you and talked a lot,

1908
01:29:17,267 --> 01:29:20,137
going on a date would feel very different.

1909
01:29:20,897 --> 01:29:23,338
It didn't seem like she was against the idea.

1910
01:29:23,437 --> 01:29:25,837
She's slightly pushing him toward that direction.

1911
01:29:25,838 --> 01:29:26,877
Right.

1912
01:29:26,878 --> 01:29:28,778
Is it because they became close?

1913
01:29:29,007 --> 01:29:31,548
I guess Yun Ha likes Ji Won better.

1914
01:29:31,748 --> 01:29:33,207
Yes, I think so.

1915
01:29:33,208 --> 01:29:34,877
That would sway him a little.

1916
01:29:34,878 --> 01:29:37,417
He's listening to something...

1917
01:29:37,418 --> 01:29:38,617
- he didn't know about at all. - Right.

1918
01:29:38,618 --> 01:29:40,517
- What she thinks. - Right.

1919
01:29:42,017 --> 01:29:43,886
But just because I change my date here,

1920
01:29:43,887 --> 01:29:45,988
- does that mean I have a chance? - Well...

1921
01:29:46,458 --> 01:29:49,328
Ji Won must have chosen someone else.

1922
01:29:49,658 --> 01:29:51,197
I think Ji Won...

1923
01:29:51,198 --> 01:29:53,837
- would have chosen Jae Hyung. - I see.

1924
01:29:53,838 --> 01:29:56,937
But it could change after those two discuss about it.

1925
01:29:57,267 --> 01:29:58,767
But you should still go for it.

1926
01:29:58,868 --> 01:30:01,636
Don't you feel like you're sticking to...

1927
01:30:01,637 --> 01:30:02,937
one person too much?

1928
01:30:03,708 --> 01:30:07,448
But I don't want Se Seung to be upset.

1929
01:30:08,977 --> 01:30:10,288
By choosing someone else?

1930
01:30:10,418 --> 01:30:13,487
Yes. I talked a lot with Se Seung today.

1931
01:30:13,488 --> 01:30:14,516
- Really? - Yes.

1932
01:30:14,517 --> 01:30:17,187
Se Seung had a whole lot of misunderstandings about me.

1933
01:30:17,488 --> 01:30:18,628
- All right. Yes. - I...

1934
01:30:19,328 --> 01:30:20,757
don't want to hurt Se Seung.

1935
01:30:22,257 --> 01:30:23,396
Did you know about this, though?

1936
01:30:23,397 --> 01:30:25,867
At the pork belly place, the owner...

1937
01:30:25,868 --> 01:30:27,967
handed the credit card to Yong Woo.

1938
01:30:28,338 --> 01:30:30,408
That was Ji Won's mother choosing...

1939
01:30:30,607 --> 01:30:33,578
the person she thought would suit Ji Won the most.

1940
01:30:33,677 --> 01:30:35,078
- Really? - Yes.

1941
01:30:35,177 --> 01:30:38,908
So both of them had chosen Yong Woo.

1942
01:30:39,107 --> 01:30:40,217
Because he's good-looking.

1943
01:30:40,317 --> 01:30:42,017
- Right. He's cool. - Yes.

1944
01:30:45,387 --> 01:30:47,516
Ji Won is sort of the wild card.

1945
01:30:47,517 --> 01:30:49,287
- She's hard to predict, isn't she? - She is.

1946
01:30:49,288 --> 01:30:50,288
- Totally. - Yes.

1947
01:30:50,288 --> 01:30:51,288
But I can't figure her out either.

1948
01:30:51,289 --> 01:30:53,426
I was with her all day, but I still don't know.

1949
01:30:53,427 --> 01:30:54,458
Really?

1950
01:30:55,097 --> 01:30:57,497
You didn't get the message about who chose you?

1951
01:30:57,498 --> 01:30:58,498
No.

1952
01:30:59,267 --> 01:31:00,967
(Glancing at Ji Won)

1953
01:31:05,507 --> 01:31:07,238
(Awkward)

1954
01:31:09,937 --> 01:31:10,977
- Hey. - Yes?

1955
01:31:11,507 --> 01:31:14,618
You and I had a little argument last Thursday.

1956
01:31:15,977 --> 01:31:17,347
Me not treating you...

1957
01:31:17,887 --> 01:31:19,947
the way I treat others right now...

1958
01:31:19,948 --> 01:31:22,957
is something I am sorry about.

1959
01:31:22,958 --> 01:31:24,627
Looking back, I do feel like that was wrong of me.

1960
01:31:24,628 --> 01:31:28,257
So I want us to start off fresh.

1961
01:31:28,458 --> 01:31:30,158
I'll keep watching out for you,

1962
01:31:30,267 --> 01:31:32,497
and I want you to talk to me...

1963
01:31:32,498 --> 01:31:34,738
even if it may be difficult for you.

1964
01:31:35,238 --> 01:31:37,607
I wanted to talk to you at the time,

1965
01:31:38,007 --> 01:31:39,766
and when you were cooking you were preoccupied...

1966
01:31:39,767 --> 01:31:41,338
which was understandable.

1967
01:31:41,607 --> 01:31:44,747
But when I brought it up again, the conversation didn't go anywhere.

1968
01:31:44,748 --> 01:31:46,747
You talked about yourself,

1969
01:31:46,748 --> 01:31:47,877
- and I was upset about that. - Right.

1970
01:31:47,878 --> 01:31:50,216
What I want is for you to tell me that, right then and there.

1971
01:31:50,217 --> 01:31:51,988
But at the time, I thought...

1972
01:31:52,618 --> 01:31:54,516
we shouldn't have a conversation about it then...

1973
01:31:54,517 --> 01:31:56,457
since we were both tired.

1974
01:31:56,458 --> 01:31:58,128
Your judgment was correct too.

1975
01:31:58,227 --> 01:32:02,097
So I think it's Jae Hyung.

1976
01:32:03,227 --> 01:32:04,227
Did I get it right?

1977
01:32:04,767 --> 01:32:05,967
Lower your voice.

1978
01:32:06,467 --> 01:32:08,698
I think it's Jae Hyung. What do you think?

1979
01:32:08,967 --> 01:32:09,967
Do you want to die?

1980
01:32:10,307 --> 01:32:13,507
I think they closed the door because they could hear us.

1981
01:32:13,807 --> 01:32:16,307
(It was just Jung Sub coming out of the bathroom.)

1982
01:32:16,738 --> 01:32:17,777
(Anyway, Ji Won feels better now.)

1983
01:32:17,778 --> 01:32:19,448
Gosh, sorry. That's just what I think.

1984
01:32:20,578 --> 01:32:24,288
Jae Hyung? I can't say it's Jae Hyung...

1985
01:32:25,418 --> 01:32:27,787
because I haven't talked to Jae Hyung yet.

1986
01:32:27,788 --> 01:32:29,487
I'm not sure who it is.

1987
01:32:29,488 --> 01:32:32,356
But as of right now, Jae Hyung...

1988
01:32:32,357 --> 01:32:34,198
is the only one I haven't talked to yet.

1989
01:32:34,998 --> 01:32:36,896
So he is the one I'm most curious about.

1990
01:32:36,897 --> 01:32:38,897
And I think...

1991
01:32:39,628 --> 01:32:42,368
In the beginning, I thought it would be nice...

1992
01:32:42,668 --> 01:32:45,266
to be with someone like Yong Woo...

1993
01:32:45,267 --> 01:32:47,507
in my current situation.

1994
01:32:47,708 --> 01:32:50,677
But, as you know, my personality is...

1995
01:32:50,878 --> 01:32:54,248
less suitable with someone who is way too sophisticated,

1996
01:32:54,347 --> 01:32:58,346
and I would get along better with someone reliable but adorable.

1997
01:32:58,347 --> 01:32:59,687
- Do you get what I mean? - Yes.

1998
01:33:00,048 --> 01:33:04,128
And I think Jae Hyung is like that.

1999
01:33:04,687 --> 01:33:05,687
He's adorable.

2000
01:33:08,427 --> 01:33:10,227
So that was your point all along.

2001
01:33:10,498 --> 01:33:12,368
He's adorable, but he's also...

2002
01:33:12,567 --> 01:33:15,097
- solid. He seems mentally solid. - Jae Hyung has his own thing.

2003
01:33:15,198 --> 01:33:16,267
He has his own thing.

2004
01:33:16,437 --> 01:33:18,367
At first, I thought he was the person...

2005
01:33:18,368 --> 01:33:19,937
I would least get along with.

2006
01:33:20,238 --> 01:33:22,506
So there's no one else at all?

2007
01:33:22,507 --> 01:33:25,447
Well, Yong Woo is so nice.

2008
01:33:25,448 --> 01:33:26,846
I feel so comfortable with him.

2009
01:33:26,847 --> 01:33:29,817
He's someone... How should I put this? I want to lean on.

2010
01:33:30,347 --> 01:33:31,617
I know what you mean.

2011
01:33:31,618 --> 01:33:33,016
Right? He's so nice.

2012
01:33:33,017 --> 01:33:35,288
But to be honest, Jae Hyung is the right fit for your personality.

2013
01:33:35,387 --> 01:33:37,227
Our family is a bit brusque than I thought we were.

2014
01:33:37,427 --> 01:33:40,287
I feel like that's why I have to be with...

2015
01:33:40,288 --> 01:33:41,356
- someone who's adorable. - Right.

2016
01:33:41,357 --> 01:33:42,927
He's someone with his own principles.

2017
01:33:43,328 --> 01:33:45,528
I can't tell you about the message I got, right?

2018
01:33:46,267 --> 01:33:47,936
You can. Right now...

2019
01:33:47,937 --> 01:33:51,436
It's time for us to discuss and choose your date.

2020
01:33:51,437 --> 01:33:53,737
What do you think? Do you want to choose someone else? Or...

2021
01:33:53,738 --> 01:33:54,738
I don't want to choose someone else.

2022
01:33:54,739 --> 01:33:55,777
You just want to keep going on dates...

2023
01:33:55,778 --> 01:33:56,807
- with Yun Ha? - Yes.

2024
01:33:57,278 --> 01:33:59,777
She's definitely someone who I thought would...

2025
01:33:59,778 --> 01:34:01,646
not only get along with you,

2026
01:34:01,647 --> 01:34:04,487
- but also would get along with me. - She gets along with you.

2027
01:34:04,488 --> 01:34:06,886
We were all very comfortable today.

2028
01:34:06,887 --> 01:34:08,186
- Right. - So...

2029
01:34:08,187 --> 01:34:10,827
I don't think I'll be good at choosing your boyfriend for you.

2030
01:34:10,828 --> 01:34:13,256
But I would have 120 percent faith...

2031
01:34:13,257 --> 01:34:15,958
in the person you chose for yourself, to be honest.

2032
01:34:16,057 --> 01:34:18,227
- I'll send Yun Ha's name. - Okay.

2033
01:34:18,897 --> 01:34:21,067
You don't even have to ask. Just send "Yun Ha."

2034
01:34:22,267 --> 01:34:24,766
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2035
01:34:24,767 --> 01:34:25,838
(Yun Jae and Ji Won's discussion is over.)

2036
01:34:27,007 --> 01:34:28,007
My hair is just...

2037
01:34:28,008 --> 01:34:29,378
Don't wear sunglasses with this outfit.

2038
01:34:29,477 --> 01:34:31,248
Who do you think you're criticizing?

2039
01:34:31,347 --> 01:34:32,607
Hey, you're...

2040
01:34:34,217 --> 01:34:36,778
I let you borrow my hat. You're so ungrateful.

2041
01:34:37,048 --> 01:34:38,646
(Still, she took off her sunglasses.)

2042
01:34:38,647 --> 01:34:39,687
Gosh.

2043
01:34:40,418 --> 01:34:41,457
Yes, well.

2044
01:34:41,458 --> 01:34:42,856
(Cho A and Cheol Hyeon's room)

2045
01:34:42,857 --> 01:34:45,056
(Nobody chose you.)

2046
01:34:45,057 --> 01:34:47,257
- Did anyone choose you? - No.

2047
01:34:49,998 --> 01:34:51,168
We have nothing to discuss.

2048
01:34:54,368 --> 01:34:56,267
I actually want to talk to you about something.

2049
01:34:58,368 --> 01:34:59,437
Yong Woo?

2050
01:34:59,738 --> 01:35:00,838
Yes, come here.

2051
01:35:01,538 --> 01:35:02,538
This is great.

2052
01:35:03,477 --> 01:35:05,007
I sent it to Yong Woo,

2053
01:35:05,208 --> 01:35:06,646
- but I just... - You didn't like Yong Woo?

2054
01:35:06,647 --> 01:35:08,547
No, he was nice. He was nice, but...

2055
01:35:08,548 --> 01:35:10,418
what was decisive was this.

2056
01:35:11,088 --> 01:35:13,417
When he went on a date with another woman,

2057
01:35:13,418 --> 01:35:15,386
and when it was time to send the message,

2058
01:35:15,387 --> 01:35:17,557
apparently, Yong Woo was very conflicted.

2059
01:35:17,828 --> 01:35:19,787
When he went on a date with the other woman,

2060
01:35:19,788 --> 01:35:22,227
he found her very charming too.

2061
01:35:24,097 --> 01:35:26,367
Up until now, I was very certain.

2062
01:35:26,368 --> 01:35:27,497
But this is what he told me.

2063
01:35:27,498 --> 01:35:30,738
He didn't know it was me who sent the messages to him.

2064
01:35:31,437 --> 01:35:32,807
- I see. - Yes.

2065
01:35:32,908 --> 01:35:35,506
Wouldn't that mean that he was conflicted...

2066
01:35:35,507 --> 01:35:38,846
about the other person too,

2067
01:35:38,847 --> 01:35:40,247
so he would have expected it to be her?

2068
01:35:40,248 --> 01:35:42,347
- Right. - That's what I think.

2069
01:35:42,578 --> 01:35:44,516
When I'm with Yong Woo,

2070
01:35:44,517 --> 01:35:47,487
I feel like I'm catering to him.

2071
01:35:47,488 --> 01:35:50,287
With Yong Woo, he's his own man.

2072
01:35:50,288 --> 01:35:52,356
- For example, when he eats, - That's right.

2073
01:35:52,357 --> 01:35:53,386
he sticks to his own thoughts...

2074
01:35:53,387 --> 01:35:54,457
- Right. - when he makes food.

2075
01:35:54,458 --> 01:35:55,597
- That's how he is. - Yes.

2076
01:35:55,927 --> 01:35:57,197
He does have a nice personality,

2077
01:35:57,198 --> 01:35:59,096
but he also tends to...

2078
01:35:59,097 --> 01:36:00,597
- stick to his own thoughts. - Yes.

2079
01:36:00,998 --> 01:36:03,137
What I keep thinking is...

2080
01:36:03,198 --> 01:36:05,136
that I don't really feel like...

2081
01:36:05,137 --> 01:36:07,337
he's giving me attention...

2082
01:36:07,338 --> 01:36:10,278
or that he cares about me.

2083
01:36:12,748 --> 01:36:15,647
So I felt complicated today.

2084
01:36:15,817 --> 01:36:17,687
- I see. - I did like the date, but...

2085
01:36:18,588 --> 01:36:22,488
But this is the first time I felt this way.

2086
01:36:22,887 --> 01:36:25,556
But I feel like Yong Woo is the one.

2087
01:36:25,557 --> 01:36:26,588
I see.

2088
01:36:28,528 --> 01:36:31,667
I feel like there are similarities between the two of you.

2089
01:36:31,668 --> 01:36:33,766
When we were together and I heard what you said,

2090
01:36:33,767 --> 01:36:35,397
I said you two got along with each other.

2091
01:36:36,267 --> 01:36:39,307
That's why Yong Woo is my only choice.

2092
01:36:40,677 --> 01:36:43,078
- And that is the right choice. - Sure.

2093
01:36:43,208 --> 01:36:46,247
- You weren't chosen by anyone. - Right.

2094
01:36:46,248 --> 01:36:47,677
Do you want me to help?

2095
01:36:48,477 --> 01:36:49,878
How do you feel?

2096
01:36:50,248 --> 01:36:52,187
I think Ji Won's nice.

2097
01:36:52,387 --> 01:36:55,587
I feel like it's because you're not being active enough.

2098
01:36:55,588 --> 01:36:58,088
- Really? - Yes. You have to let her know.

2099
01:36:58,927 --> 01:37:00,998
- A date... - I hope the two of you get to go.

2100
01:37:01,097 --> 01:37:02,097
Yes.

2101
01:37:04,668 --> 01:37:06,127
Goodness.

2102
01:37:06,128 --> 01:37:07,168
(Yong Woo and Ju Yeon's room)

2103
01:37:08,168 --> 01:37:11,607
(Cho A chose you.)

2104
01:37:12,007 --> 01:37:15,077
(Cho A chose your sibling.)

2105
01:37:15,078 --> 01:37:18,078
- Well, it's one person. - Yes.

2106
01:37:18,748 --> 01:37:21,547
But even if someone wanted to choose you,

2107
01:37:21,548 --> 01:37:24,087
you seem too set in your direction.

2108
01:37:24,088 --> 01:37:26,187
Yes, that's right. I understand.

2109
01:37:30,357 --> 01:37:32,788
So do you want to just go with this person?

2110
01:37:35,727 --> 01:37:36,897
For the first time,

2111
01:37:37,397 --> 01:37:41,936
I think I felt that I wanted some time...

2112
01:37:41,937 --> 01:37:44,067
to think...

2113
01:37:44,368 --> 01:37:46,668
after receiving a message...

2114
01:37:47,307 --> 01:37:48,738
about Cho A.

2115
01:37:49,238 --> 01:37:50,577
The excitement...

2116
01:37:50,578 --> 01:37:53,006
about perhaps seeing Cho A again tomorrow...

2117
01:37:53,007 --> 01:37:55,146
and the anxiety about discovering another sense of...

2118
01:37:55,147 --> 01:37:57,418
emptiness inside of me after spending time with her.

2119
01:37:57,647 --> 01:38:02,118
A combination of those feelings came to me,

2120
01:38:02,588 --> 01:38:04,687
and I had a lot to think about that night.

2121
01:38:05,458 --> 01:38:07,997
Is it necessary for me to choose someone else?

2122
01:38:07,998 --> 01:38:10,028
I feel the same way too.

2123
01:38:10,128 --> 01:38:12,566
So we'll just go with you two making good memories.

2124
01:38:12,567 --> 01:38:13,827
We had a good time today too.

2125
01:38:13,828 --> 01:38:16,466
So I feel like it won't be bad to just go with Cho A.

2126
01:38:16,467 --> 01:38:17,908
So our discussion is over.

2127
01:38:18,607 --> 01:38:21,177
(He quickly ends their discussion and sends Cho A's name.)

2128
01:38:21,738 --> 01:38:24,977
Instead of sharing and talking about this feeling that I felt...

2129
01:38:25,278 --> 01:38:27,147
for the first time today,

2130
01:38:27,347 --> 01:38:29,847
I think I just said it was okay...

2131
01:38:30,078 --> 01:38:32,816
and tried to listen to what she had to say.

2132
01:38:32,817 --> 01:38:33,817
Like always.

2133
01:38:34,057 --> 01:38:37,256
I feel like Ji Won and Jae Hyung will go on a date this time.

2134
01:38:37,257 --> 01:38:38,257
Yes.

2135
01:38:38,528 --> 01:38:40,658
Ji Won and Jae Hyung are...

2136
01:38:41,927 --> 01:38:44,426
I think they'd want to go on a date...

2137
01:38:44,427 --> 01:38:46,066
where they want to be with each other.

2138
01:38:46,067 --> 01:38:47,896
- Yes, I agree. - Yes.

2139
01:38:47,897 --> 01:38:49,867
But the way I see it,

2140
01:38:49,868 --> 01:38:52,966
even though your situation may be more unstable...

2141
01:38:52,967 --> 01:38:55,437
than my situation, that could be more fun.

2142
01:38:56,538 --> 01:38:57,878
Yes, because we're...

2143
01:38:58,708 --> 01:39:00,976
calm and steady between us.

2144
01:39:00,977 --> 01:39:03,377
That's what the others think too.

2145
01:39:03,378 --> 01:39:05,618
They say you're pretty much a pair of newlyweds.

2146
01:39:07,817 --> 01:39:09,118
Calm and steady.

2147
01:39:10,057 --> 01:39:13,287
Is there no one you're instinctively drawn to?

2148
01:39:13,288 --> 01:39:15,658
- At first, there was no one. - What about now?

2149
01:39:16,727 --> 01:39:17,966
- Ji Won? - Yes.

2150
01:39:17,967 --> 01:39:21,338
But I don't really know why myself.

2151
01:39:21,698 --> 01:39:25,937
I think Ji Won had too much makeup on at first.

2152
01:39:26,668 --> 01:39:30,006
- Yes. - But her face suddenly changed.

2153
01:39:30,007 --> 01:39:31,007
Yes.

2154
01:39:31,177 --> 01:39:32,177
Don't you think so?

2155
01:39:32,378 --> 01:39:33,947
- Nothing's changed. - I mean...

2156
01:39:33,948 --> 01:39:35,278
All of a sudden,

2157
01:39:35,717 --> 01:39:38,118
I noticed she looked different than my first impression of her.

2158
01:39:38,387 --> 01:39:39,617
As soon as I saw her for the first time,

2159
01:39:39,618 --> 01:39:41,618
I thought to myself that she was your type.

2160
01:39:42,118 --> 01:39:43,187
- Really? - Yes.

2161
01:39:43,458 --> 01:39:46,186
Or because of the specificity of the situation,

2162
01:39:46,187 --> 01:39:48,857
maybe I tried to stop myself from seeing to clearly.

2163
01:39:48,998 --> 01:39:53,227
I feel like I'm now...

2164
01:39:53,427 --> 01:39:56,238
- Exhausted? - No, I'm not exhausted.

2165
01:39:56,397 --> 01:39:58,338
I actually just now started to adapt here.

2166
01:39:58,567 --> 01:39:59,767
I think I'm quite slow.

2167
01:40:01,738 --> 01:40:03,937
And now I'm beginning to feel sorry.

2168
01:40:05,448 --> 01:40:07,877
She knows. I think she knows.

2169
01:40:07,878 --> 01:40:10,918
She even knows who I'm curious about right now.

2170
01:40:11,088 --> 01:40:12,947
So I got chills.

2171
01:40:12,948 --> 01:40:14,488
It's inevitable for her to know.

2172
01:40:14,788 --> 01:40:15,957
- Is there... - So why is Ji Won doing this...

2173
01:40:15,958 --> 01:40:17,628
to me all of a sudden?

2174
01:40:18,227 --> 01:40:19,987
- Go ask her. - There was nothing between us.

2175
01:40:19,988 --> 01:40:21,797
There are only five days left.

2176
01:40:21,798 --> 01:40:23,297
There is an appropriate reason.

2177
01:40:23,298 --> 01:40:24,566
You know what it is?

2178
01:40:24,567 --> 01:40:26,498
- Just tell me that. - I know everything.

2179
01:40:27,498 --> 01:40:29,498
- Let's go. - You must be insane.

2180
01:40:30,267 --> 01:40:32,967
(The others are already gathered in the living room.)

2181
01:40:33,267 --> 01:40:35,377
I did a great impression of Cho A earlier, didn't I?

2182
01:40:35,378 --> 01:40:36,437
What?

2183
01:40:36,778 --> 01:40:37,847
Flutter, flutter.

2184
01:40:38,748 --> 01:40:40,106
It's like Cho A walks on air.

2185
01:40:40,107 --> 01:40:41,747
Other people walk around like thud, thud.

2186
01:40:41,748 --> 01:40:43,917
- But Cho A flutters around. - He said...

2187
01:40:43,918 --> 01:40:46,287
it feels as if you walk around 3cm off the surface.

2188
01:40:46,288 --> 01:40:48,458
I don't think her feet ever touch the ground.

2189
01:40:48,618 --> 01:40:50,927
The woman who doesn't properly step on the ground.

2190
01:40:51,557 --> 01:40:52,988
The woman who walks around mid air.

2191
01:40:54,998 --> 01:40:56,897
I'm scared to go downstairs.

2192
01:40:58,128 --> 01:41:00,766
I really... I can't...

2193
01:41:00,767 --> 01:41:03,367
I'll do my best to comfort Ju Yeon.

2194
01:41:03,368 --> 01:41:04,908
You do whatever you feel like.

2195
01:41:05,368 --> 01:41:07,577
How do people act in these situations?

2196
01:41:07,578 --> 01:41:08,578
They set clear boundaries.

2197
01:41:09,038 --> 01:41:11,948
I know, but...

2198
01:41:14,578 --> 01:41:16,147
You should at least be considerate.

2199
01:41:17,887 --> 01:41:19,517
Are we the only ones organizing our things?

2200
01:41:21,257 --> 01:41:23,056
You were organizing.

2201
01:41:23,057 --> 01:41:24,088
Come here.

2202
01:41:24,357 --> 01:41:25,857
Where should I sit?

2203
01:41:26,158 --> 01:41:27,186
Over here.

2204
01:41:27,187 --> 01:41:28,257
There.

2205
01:41:28,528 --> 01:41:30,257
- Come sit over here. - Go sit there.

2206
01:41:31,097 --> 01:41:32,128
Sit there.

2207
01:41:45,448 --> 01:41:49,578
(Se Seung and Jung Sub will be going on a date.)

2208
01:41:55,288 --> 01:41:56,417
(Sending sibling signals)

2209
01:41:56,418 --> 01:41:57,628
What is it?

2210
01:42:03,198 --> 01:42:04,767
(Is it Ji Won?)

2211
01:42:05,427 --> 01:42:06,467
No.

2212
01:42:12,137 --> 01:42:16,378
(Yong Woo and Cho A will be going on a date.)

2213
01:42:18,378 --> 01:42:19,607
I want to go grocery shopping tomorrow.

2214
01:42:19,748 --> 01:42:21,516
I want to go grocery shopping tomorrow too.

2215
01:42:21,517 --> 01:42:22,817
What are you going to make?

2216
01:42:23,147 --> 01:42:24,618
Whatever you want to eat.

2217
01:42:26,317 --> 01:42:30,288
(Yun Ha and Yun Jae will be going on a date.)

2218
01:42:31,857 --> 01:42:35,257
I'm so happy. It's what I've been hoping for the most.

2219
01:42:35,828 --> 01:42:37,256
I'm so excited,

2220
01:42:37,257 --> 01:42:39,798
and I don't know what we'll be doing,

2221
01:42:39,897 --> 01:42:42,798
but I intend to enjoy Singapore to the fullest...

2222
01:42:43,338 --> 01:42:44,408
with him.

2223
01:42:45,067 --> 01:42:46,537
That's the kick, though.

2224
01:42:46,538 --> 01:42:50,037
Right. After eating...

2225
01:42:50,038 --> 01:42:52,207
Ji Won was next to me, and we both threw away...

2226
01:42:52,208 --> 01:42:53,306
the shells to each other.

2227
01:42:53,307 --> 01:42:56,817
(Ji Won and Jae Hyung will be going on a date.)

2228
01:42:57,887 --> 01:42:59,488
Gosh, I'm happy too.

2229
01:43:00,048 --> 01:43:02,488
- Gosh, I'm curious. - I have butterflies.

2230
01:43:02,788 --> 01:43:05,127
He's the person I was the most curious about,

2231
01:43:05,128 --> 01:43:08,158
so I was very glad when I found out we were going on a date together.

2232
01:43:13,798 --> 01:43:16,767
Nothing had happened between me and Ji Won.

2233
01:43:17,708 --> 01:43:21,207
And I think our first impressions of each other...

2234
01:43:21,208 --> 01:43:22,738
weren't that good.

2235
01:43:23,408 --> 01:43:25,378
- It's nice to meet you. - Who are you?

2236
01:43:25,948 --> 01:43:27,547
That's probably why...

2237
01:43:27,548 --> 01:43:29,316
she didn't try to talk in Seoul.

2238
01:43:29,317 --> 01:43:31,047
I also thought...

2239
01:43:31,048 --> 01:43:32,588
it was unnecessary to talk to her.

2240
01:43:32,788 --> 01:43:36,217
But despite that, I became curious about her all of a sudden,

2241
01:43:36,618 --> 01:43:39,887
and I was excited when she chose me.

2242
01:43:39,988 --> 01:43:41,327
"What kind of things would we talk about?"

2243
01:43:41,328 --> 01:43:42,958
"I wonder who she is as a person?"

2244
01:43:43,357 --> 01:43:47,198
"Is she someone who I can possibly develop feelings for?"

2245
01:43:55,208 --> 01:43:58,408
(Ju Yeon failed to match with a date.)

2246
01:44:03,217 --> 01:44:06,187
I was so worried about her.

2247
01:44:06,288 --> 01:44:08,417
I felt so sad for her,

2248
01:44:08,418 --> 01:44:09,618
and I was a bit concerned.

2249
01:44:09,887 --> 01:44:13,227
It seemed like Ji Won chose Jae Hyung.

2250
01:44:13,427 --> 01:44:15,896
Had Jae Hyung chosen me,

2251
01:44:15,897 --> 01:44:17,667
I would have been surprised.

2252
01:44:17,668 --> 01:44:20,498
And I hope Jae Hyung would get to know Ji Won too.

2253
01:44:20,897 --> 01:44:23,066
Then we wouldn't have any regrets...

2254
01:44:23,067 --> 01:44:26,607
no matter what decisions we make later on.

2255
01:44:40,887 --> 01:44:41,958
(Hey!)

2256
01:44:43,817 --> 01:44:44,958
You startled me.

2257
01:44:45,988 --> 01:44:47,227
"You startled me."

2258
01:44:48,198 --> 01:44:51,298
(Jae Hyung goes to his room.)

2259
01:44:53,597 --> 01:44:55,538
- What? - Yes?

2260
01:44:55,798 --> 01:44:58,408
I am sorry. I entered the wrong room.

2261
01:44:58,507 --> 01:44:59,507
Okay.

2262
01:45:01,538 --> 01:45:03,607
(He finally comes to the right room.)

2263
01:45:04,807 --> 01:45:05,908
What are you doing tomorrow?

2264
01:45:06,878 --> 01:45:08,248
- What? - Nothing?

2265
01:45:09,017 --> 01:45:10,676
- Tomorrow? I have a date. - Yes.

2266
01:45:10,677 --> 01:45:12,248
- With whom? - Jae Hyung.

2267
01:45:13,618 --> 01:45:16,217
(- Yes! - Ouch.)

2268
01:45:16,517 --> 01:45:17,658
I see why you decided not to drink.

2269
01:45:18,158 --> 01:45:19,427
You traitor.

2270
01:45:21,597 --> 01:45:22,856
(Yun Ha borrowed an air conditioner remote control.)

2271
01:45:22,857 --> 01:45:24,427
- Give it back after you are done. - Okay.

2272
01:45:27,097 --> 01:45:28,137
There is one.

2273
01:45:28,798 --> 01:45:31,208
Hey, there is an insect.

2274
01:45:31,307 --> 01:45:32,637
- My goodness. - Oh, no.

2275
01:45:32,708 --> 01:45:33,936
(There is a mysterious insect on the air conditioner.)

2276
01:45:33,937 --> 01:45:34,937
You are right.

2277
01:45:35,078 --> 01:45:36,208
Please catch it.

2278
01:45:37,078 --> 01:45:38,947
- What are we supposed to do? - Hold on.

2279
01:45:38,948 --> 01:45:40,908
I think we should spray it.

2280
01:45:41,278 --> 01:45:42,317
What should we do?

2281
01:45:44,788 --> 01:45:46,387
What should we do?

2282
01:45:47,118 --> 01:45:49,087
We need to turn off the lights.

2283
01:45:49,088 --> 01:45:51,488
If the lights are on, insects will enter.

2284
01:45:51,927 --> 01:45:53,127
(Yun Jae visits Yun Ha's room at that moment.)

2285
01:45:53,128 --> 01:45:55,128
May I enter for a second?

2286
01:45:55,498 --> 01:45:57,328
- Yes. - Look at that.

2287
01:45:57,557 --> 01:45:58,927
Where? A bee?

2288
01:45:59,498 --> 01:46:00,897
- A bee. - Is there body wash in here?

2289
01:46:01,637 --> 01:46:03,436
(He sprays it without a moment of hesitation.)

2290
01:46:03,437 --> 01:46:04,668
(Startled)

2291
01:46:05,208 --> 01:46:06,607
Don't lie there for a second.

2292
01:46:07,007 --> 01:46:09,208
(He takes care of it with tissue paper.)

2293
01:46:09,507 --> 01:46:12,547
We need to kill two.

2294
01:46:12,548 --> 01:46:14,407
- This isn't a bee. - Isn't it a bee?

2295
01:46:14,408 --> 01:46:15,448
No.

2296
01:46:15,977 --> 01:46:17,017
Here it is. I found it.

2297
01:46:18,048 --> 01:46:19,048
I got it.

2298
01:46:20,347 --> 01:46:21,458
It isn't inside.

2299
01:46:27,057 --> 01:46:28,057
It isn't here.

2300
01:46:28,198 --> 01:46:29,227
(Smacking)

2301
01:46:29,698 --> 01:46:30,757
He is a man.

2302
01:46:31,727 --> 01:46:33,566
For a while,

2303
01:46:33,567 --> 01:46:35,937
- we will need to air the room. - Go ahead.

2304
01:46:35,998 --> 01:46:37,597
One should stay outside and one should wash up.

2305
01:46:37,967 --> 01:46:39,168
(My goodness!)

2306
01:46:39,338 --> 01:46:40,937
He said one should stay outside and one should wash up.

2307
01:46:41,208 --> 01:46:42,506
He said he would catch the insects.

2308
01:46:42,507 --> 01:46:43,777
Gosh, Yun Jae.

2309
01:46:43,778 --> 01:46:47,247
- He is a loving man. - Yun Jae.

2310
01:46:47,248 --> 01:46:48,847
One should stay outside and one should wash up.

2311
01:46:49,278 --> 01:46:51,817
(One continues to catch insects.)

2312
01:46:51,988 --> 01:46:53,118
I will only catch the big ones.

2313
01:46:57,488 --> 01:46:58,727
I got one.

2314
01:46:59,458 --> 01:47:00,557
Thank you.

2315
01:47:01,557 --> 01:47:02,926
We need to wipe the area...

2316
01:47:02,927 --> 01:47:04,128
where the insect killer spray got on.

2317
01:47:05,828 --> 01:47:08,667
Yes. Push it down.

2318
01:47:08,668 --> 01:47:09,698
Push it down and wipe it.

2319
01:47:09,738 --> 01:47:13,038
(They take care of the dead insects.)

2320
01:47:13,637 --> 01:47:14,778
I think we are mostly done.

2321
01:47:16,338 --> 01:47:17,378
Yun Ha.

2322
01:47:18,208 --> 01:47:20,248
Yes? What is it?

2323
01:47:20,977 --> 01:47:22,048
I caught them all.

2324
01:47:22,177 --> 01:47:24,278
- Did you catch them all? - Yes.

2325
01:47:24,817 --> 01:47:25,847
Do you have a headache?

2326
01:47:26,948 --> 01:47:29,588
We need to air the room. We need to open the windows.

2327
01:47:29,817 --> 01:47:32,387
- Then more insects will enter. - Right.

2328
01:47:32,588 --> 01:47:34,698
- Will you live with the insects? - What?

2329
01:47:34,927 --> 01:47:37,998
(They wait for the room to get ventilated.)

2330
01:47:38,298 --> 01:47:41,596
- Don't you have it in your room? - What?

2331
01:47:41,597 --> 01:47:43,396
- The ceiling fan. - There is.

2332
01:47:43,397 --> 01:47:45,467
- We can turn it on. - I will do that.

2333
01:47:46,067 --> 01:47:48,378
- Then the room will get aired out. - Yes.

2334
01:47:48,838 --> 01:47:50,537
- What? - We have a ceiling fan.

2335
01:47:50,538 --> 01:47:51,677
(He is a man who doesn't hesitate to do things.)

2336
01:47:53,177 --> 01:47:55,477
(Turning on)

2337
01:47:59,147 --> 01:48:01,217
- I turned it on. - Yun Jae, thank you so much.

2338
01:48:01,458 --> 01:48:03,158
The smell will be gone once you wash up.

2339
01:48:03,387 --> 01:48:04,458
Okay.

2340
01:48:05,187 --> 01:48:06,988
How is it that both siblings can't catch insects?

2341
01:48:09,227 --> 01:48:12,367
Those insects were too big.

2342
01:48:12,368 --> 01:48:14,298
That room was nice.

2343
01:48:14,838 --> 01:48:16,298
There were no insects.

2344
01:48:16,338 --> 01:48:19,668
Nonsense. There were insects.

2345
01:48:22,338 --> 01:48:24,606
- Aren't you cold? - I am not cold now.

2346
01:48:24,607 --> 01:48:26,107
- Are you okay? - I guess my legs were cold.

2347
01:48:26,278 --> 01:48:27,278
Really?

2348
01:48:30,847 --> 01:48:32,417
What is up with that strange vibe?

2349
01:48:32,418 --> 01:48:35,618
They fell in love. The love has begun.

2350
01:48:36,317 --> 01:48:37,387
It's insane.

2351
01:48:37,488 --> 01:48:38,788
What?

2352
01:48:40,088 --> 01:48:41,158
What is going on?

2353
01:48:41,458 --> 01:48:43,057
- Don't you have a date tomorrow? - Yes.

2354
01:48:43,458 --> 01:48:44,668
Will it happen in the evening?

2355
01:48:45,267 --> 01:48:46,597
We can have a date during the day.

2356
01:48:47,828 --> 01:48:50,238
Right. Will we spend time together during the day?

2357
01:48:50,897 --> 01:48:52,006
I know.

2358
01:48:52,007 --> 01:48:53,437
But we need to get some sleep.

2359
01:48:55,208 --> 01:48:57,107
- Are you tired? - You won't sleep, but...

2360
01:48:57,607 --> 01:48:58,847
Right. We can do it in the evening.

2361
01:48:59,378 --> 01:49:01,007
You drank a lot too.

2362
01:49:01,748 --> 01:49:02,817
What do you mean?

2363
01:49:03,147 --> 01:49:04,988
You were excited earlier.

2364
01:49:09,158 --> 01:49:11,687
I can't believe that I am in Singapore.

2365
01:49:12,328 --> 01:49:13,958
How could you say that after eating so much chilli crab?

2366
01:49:14,557 --> 01:49:15,597
What?

2367
01:49:17,397 --> 01:49:19,897
Let's buy an insect killer spray that smells better tomorrow.

2368
01:49:20,727 --> 01:49:21,837
One that isn't so strong.

2369
01:49:21,838 --> 01:49:23,267
You are so self-sufficient.

2370
01:49:26,338 --> 01:49:28,038
I have lived alone for a long time.

2371
01:49:32,177 --> 01:49:33,707
I could fall asleep here.

2372
01:49:33,708 --> 01:49:35,048
You are going to sleep here, right?

2373
01:49:40,847 --> 01:49:42,857
You didn't do your nails. You just did your toenails.

2374
01:49:42,887 --> 01:49:44,788
Yes. I have never done my nails.

2375
01:49:44,958 --> 01:49:46,958
- Why not? You play the cello. - I play the cello.

2376
01:49:46,988 --> 01:49:47,998
Right.

2377
01:49:48,257 --> 01:49:49,628
I have never done it.

2378
01:49:49,927 --> 01:49:51,897
It feels stuffy.

2379
01:49:51,927 --> 01:49:54,227
I see why you made your toenails pink.

2380
01:49:55,597 --> 01:49:58,067
I chose a colour that didn't stand out.

2381
01:49:59,637 --> 01:50:00,738
It stands out a lot.

2382
01:50:10,548 --> 01:50:12,548
- You are tired, right? - I am tired.

2383
01:50:13,248 --> 01:50:14,958
- You should wash up. - Okay.

2384
01:50:19,628 --> 01:50:22,057
Why are you not getting up after saying okay?

2385
01:50:23,057 --> 01:50:24,298
I will get up.

2386
01:50:25,198 --> 01:50:26,797
- When? - Now.

2387
01:50:26,798 --> 01:50:27,927
- Now? - Yes.

2388
01:50:28,698 --> 01:50:29,838
I need to get up.

2389
01:50:31,198 --> 01:50:32,567
You are struggling to get up.

2390
01:50:33,708 --> 01:50:34,778
I am struggling.

2391
01:50:38,278 --> 01:50:39,878
I turned on the fan as strongly as possible.

2392
01:50:40,948 --> 01:50:42,278
I turned it on as strongly as possible.

2393
01:50:42,717 --> 01:50:45,118
Yun Jae, thank you so much.

2394
01:50:45,647 --> 01:50:47,418
(He revisits the room.)

2395
01:50:48,887 --> 01:50:49,988
The smell is lessening.

2396
01:50:52,757 --> 01:50:54,128
He comes to check.

2397
01:50:54,927 --> 01:50:55,927
The smell is lessening.

2398
01:50:56,658 --> 01:50:58,397
- A little bit. - Yes. I think it's okay.

2399
01:51:00,498 --> 01:51:02,738
Did you come to check?

2400
01:51:03,897 --> 01:51:05,238
I will catch only the big ones.

2401
01:51:05,338 --> 01:51:06,807
Here it is.

2402
01:51:07,738 --> 01:51:08,838
Are there more?

2403
01:51:11,137 --> 01:51:12,607
That way, they won't get on the windows.

2404
01:51:13,548 --> 01:51:15,078
Yun Jae, thank you so much.

2405
01:51:15,977 --> 01:51:17,378
Wash up and go to sleep when your sister comes out.

2406
01:51:17,717 --> 01:51:19,118
- Okay? - Thank you for your hard work.

2407
01:51:19,687 --> 01:51:21,386
- I will crack the door open. - Okay.

2408
01:51:21,387 --> 01:51:22,957
The smell needs to lessen more.

2409
01:51:22,958 --> 01:51:24,217
Okay. Thank you.

2410
01:51:26,387 --> 01:51:29,498
(He falls asleep after getting rid of the insects.)

2411
01:51:30,257 --> 01:51:32,397
Yun Jae treats you well, right?

2412
01:51:32,998 --> 01:51:34,198
Overly so.

2413
01:51:34,467 --> 01:51:36,637
I think Yun Jae is nice. Seriously.

2414
01:51:37,467 --> 01:51:38,767
He is a nice man.

2415
01:51:46,807 --> 01:51:50,647
(They welcome their first morning in Singapore.)

2416
01:51:59,088 --> 01:52:00,088
It's so pretty.

2417
01:52:00,089 --> 01:52:01,997
- What? It's like a painting. - I know.

2418
01:52:01,998 --> 01:52:03,397
The weather is nice.

2419
01:52:05,227 --> 01:52:08,567
(He begins the day by splitting his legs.)

2420
01:52:14,908 --> 01:52:17,107
(He welcomes the morning by exercising on an empty stomach.)

2421
01:52:17,807 --> 01:52:20,708
- You woke up. - Good morning.

2422
01:52:21,618 --> 01:52:23,748
- This place is incredible. - It's amazing, right?

2423
01:52:24,647 --> 01:52:26,988
It's so nice to come here after being stuck at home.

2424
01:52:28,488 --> 01:52:29,857
This place is unbelievable.

2425
01:52:37,198 --> 01:52:38,967
I see monkeys over there too.

2426
01:52:39,267 --> 01:52:40,328
- Did you see it? - Yes.

2427
01:52:40,628 --> 01:52:42,998
- I saw some in the yard. - Really?

2428
01:52:50,078 --> 01:52:52,077
- What? - What? It's CODE KUNST.

2429
01:52:52,078 --> 01:52:53,408
- Wasn't it a squirrel? - It's me.

2430
01:52:54,607 --> 01:52:56,316
- It's me. - CODE KUNST, don't chew on it.

2431
01:52:56,317 --> 01:52:57,918
Why do I have no memory of going there?

2432
01:52:59,187 --> 01:53:01,047
- What are you eating? - Seriously.

2433
01:53:01,048 --> 01:53:02,787
- You shouldn't chew on it. - My goodness.

2434
01:53:02,788 --> 01:53:04,817
- It's sweet if you chew on it. - Really?

2435
01:53:08,597 --> 01:53:09,857
It's sweet if you chew on it a lot.

2436
01:53:18,868 --> 01:53:20,408
They will come up to the house.

2437
01:53:23,238 --> 01:53:26,248
(They are absorbed in watching the monkeys.)

2438
01:53:27,078 --> 01:53:29,618
(Jae Hyung leaves the house in a diligent way.)

2439
01:53:41,488 --> 01:53:42,528
It's hot.

2440
01:53:52,208 --> 01:53:53,967
(Yun Jae gets up.)

2441
01:53:57,007 --> 01:53:58,078
Good morning.

2442
01:54:01,147 --> 01:54:03,118
Gosh, your muscles are defined even in the morning.

2443
01:54:05,418 --> 01:54:07,247
- It's really nice. - What?

2444
01:54:07,248 --> 01:54:08,257
This place is really nice.

2445
01:54:14,628 --> 01:54:16,397
(Jae Hyung returns after jogging.)

2446
01:54:18,897 --> 01:54:21,667
- Since you are going up, - I am going down.

2447
01:54:21,668 --> 01:54:24,238
- please get my towel. - I am going down.

2448
01:54:25,338 --> 01:54:27,437
- Hi. - Hi.

2449
01:54:29,078 --> 01:54:30,208
Will I wear flip flops?

2450
01:54:32,708 --> 01:54:33,908
Answer me.

2451
01:54:35,418 --> 01:54:37,378
- How do I look? - You look great.

2452
01:54:37,448 --> 01:54:39,217
This accentuates my arm fat.

2453
01:54:39,488 --> 01:54:41,317
(Laughing)

2454
01:54:41,658 --> 01:54:44,287
I am in trouble. I mostly brought T-shirts.

2455
01:54:44,288 --> 01:54:46,887
(They are busy in the morning getting ready for the date.)

2456
01:54:48,998 --> 01:54:50,727
Stop darkening your eyes.

2457
01:54:51,158 --> 01:54:52,198
Stay out of my business.

2458
01:54:52,397 --> 01:54:53,397
(For goodness' sake.)

2459
01:54:56,597 --> 01:54:57,597
What?

2460
01:54:58,437 --> 01:55:00,306
(He wants her to contour his face.)

2461
01:55:00,307 --> 01:55:01,368
For goodness' sake.

2462
01:55:12,588 --> 01:55:16,387
(Shaping her brother's chin)

2463
01:55:22,198 --> 01:55:24,057
I hope my brush doesn't get contaminated.

2464
01:55:24,357 --> 01:55:25,967
Why would you say that in the morning?

2465
01:55:26,128 --> 01:55:27,198
Gosh, you stink.

2466
01:55:28,227 --> 01:55:30,097
Open your eyes.

2467
01:55:35,477 --> 01:55:36,477
Thanks.

2468
01:55:41,748 --> 01:55:43,716
I should have my hair down today.

2469
01:55:43,717 --> 01:55:45,017
I am going to wear this today.

2470
01:55:45,618 --> 01:55:47,488
You really shouldn't. Please.

2471
01:55:47,948 --> 01:55:50,288
Put it down. Don't annoy me.

2472
01:55:52,958 --> 01:55:54,387
I feel bad for Ji Won.

2473
01:55:57,857 --> 01:55:58,967
Shall I wear this?

2474
01:56:00,967 --> 01:56:02,737
Ji Won doesn't wear...

2475
01:56:02,738 --> 01:56:04,868
- cute clothes. - I can't match her style.

2476
01:56:05,168 --> 01:56:08,538
Ji Won doesn't wear cute clothes, but that's too cute.

2477
01:56:10,437 --> 01:56:11,637
Is it too cute?

2478
01:56:11,977 --> 01:56:13,077
It's cute.

2479
01:56:13,078 --> 01:56:15,077
It's cute, but those pants make it okay.

2480
01:56:15,078 --> 01:56:16,078
- Really? - Yes.

2481
01:56:16,677 --> 01:56:18,716
I feel like I shouldn't be cute.

2482
01:56:18,717 --> 01:56:20,387
It's okay. You aren't that cute.

2483
01:56:21,017 --> 01:56:22,488
You are the only one who thinks that.

2484
01:56:22,857 --> 01:56:23,988
- Mom? - You.

2485
01:56:24,387 --> 01:56:25,657
Mom thinks I am cute.

2486
01:56:25,658 --> 01:56:26,958
(Laughing)

2487
01:56:27,128 --> 01:56:28,857
Mom finds me cuter than you.

2488
01:56:29,298 --> 01:56:30,458
You are seriously mistaken.

2489
01:56:30,757 --> 01:56:33,328
- It's true. - You are seriously mistaken.

2490
01:56:33,498 --> 01:56:35,467
Mom loves me more than you.

2491
01:56:38,908 --> 01:56:40,037
You can't refute that.

2492
01:56:40,038 --> 01:56:42,238
Yes, I can. I can refute it so easily.

2493
01:56:44,278 --> 01:56:45,347
How annoying.

2494
01:56:46,847 --> 01:56:49,118
What should I wear? This is bad.

2495
01:56:49,817 --> 01:56:51,378
Don't wear dark clothes.

2496
01:56:52,847 --> 01:56:55,517
You should see what Yun Ha wears.

2497
01:56:56,658 --> 01:56:58,257
She will look pretty no matter what she wears.

2498
01:56:58,588 --> 01:56:59,628
What's wrong with him?

2499
01:57:00,557 --> 01:57:01,857
- Ji Won. - Yes?

2500
01:57:02,028 --> 01:57:03,357
- Can I go in? - Yes.

2501
01:57:03,757 --> 01:57:05,998
- Let me use the restroom. - Okay.

2502
01:57:06,698 --> 01:57:08,668
Does this restroom have two sinks?

2503
01:57:09,698 --> 01:57:10,967
I am so jealous.

2504
01:57:12,538 --> 01:57:15,538
I will feed Jae Hyung a lot of tasty food.

2505
01:57:16,107 --> 01:57:17,137
Please do that.

2506
01:57:17,778 --> 01:57:20,708
Please tell Jae Hyung to apply sunscreen.

2507
01:57:21,248 --> 01:57:22,976
Okay. But he does it well on his own.

2508
01:57:22,977 --> 01:57:24,016
- Really? - Yes.

2509
01:57:24,017 --> 01:57:26,187
He takes care of his skin better than me.

2510
01:57:27,187 --> 01:57:28,458
- It's tasty. - Yes.

2511
01:57:29,687 --> 01:57:31,587
I worked out with Cheol Hyeon.

2512
01:57:31,588 --> 01:57:32,788
- Did you work out? - Yes.

2513
01:57:33,227 --> 01:57:35,328
Cheol Hyeon went down and began swimming.

2514
01:57:35,927 --> 01:57:36,958
He is still swimming now.

2515
01:57:46,668 --> 01:57:49,278
You look like a dad who is looking at his son proudly.

2516
01:57:50,677 --> 01:57:51,807
We are only one year apart.

2517
01:57:54,347 --> 01:57:55,347
Yong Woo.

2518
01:57:56,118 --> 01:57:57,118
Yong Woo.

2519
01:57:57,517 --> 01:57:58,647
He is so loud.

2520
01:57:59,088 --> 01:58:00,118
Yong Woo.

2521
01:58:00,687 --> 01:58:02,387
- How is he so loud? - Yong Woo.

2522
01:58:06,328 --> 01:58:07,727
Nothing looks good on me.

2523
01:58:07,887 --> 01:58:09,597
(She is torn about an outfit for the date.)

2524
01:58:10,298 --> 01:58:11,967
Jae Hyung doesn't have hairspray either.

2525
01:58:13,168 --> 01:58:15,767
Please zip up your fly.

2526
01:58:16,937 --> 01:58:18,436
(Jae Hyung comes to borrow wax.)

2527
01:58:18,437 --> 01:58:19,907
- Ji Won is in the room. - Ji Won, hello.

2528
01:58:19,908 --> 01:58:20,908
Jae Hyung, hello.

2529
01:58:20,909 --> 01:58:23,908
Jae Hyung, is that your outfit for the date?

2530
01:58:24,177 --> 01:58:25,177
Shall I wear something else?

2531
01:58:25,177 --> 01:58:26,177
- No. - Here.

2532
01:58:26,178 --> 01:58:27,907
- It's similar to my outfit. - Really?

2533
01:58:27,908 --> 01:58:29,548
I will just touch this part.

2534
01:58:30,078 --> 01:58:32,288
Yes. There you go.

2535
01:58:32,847 --> 01:58:35,048
Yun Jae, you look a bit like you are in the beauty business.

2536
01:58:36,588 --> 01:58:38,588
Not food business, but beauty business.

2537
01:58:39,687 --> 01:58:40,687
Seriously.

2538
01:58:41,628 --> 01:58:43,328
He does look like someone in the beauty business.

2539
01:58:44,698 --> 01:58:46,927
My sister will go on a date.

2540
01:58:48,267 --> 01:58:51,168
She is grinning from ear to ear. It's so annoying to see.

2541
01:58:51,298 --> 01:58:52,407
I am sorry,

2542
01:58:52,408 --> 01:58:54,708
but you are the one who is grinning from ear to ear.

2543
01:58:54,937 --> 01:58:55,977
It's me?

2544
01:58:58,607 --> 01:58:59,847
Is that your outfit?

2545
01:59:00,248 --> 01:59:03,016
No, I was going to layer a skirt.

2546
01:59:03,017 --> 01:59:04,017
A skirt?

2547
01:59:07,918 --> 01:59:09,757
- Just wear pants. - Why?

2548
01:59:11,488 --> 01:59:14,927
It's a trend. Layering is a trend. You don't know the trends.

2549
01:59:17,998 --> 01:59:20,498
(She follows the trend.)

2550
01:59:21,937 --> 01:59:23,698
- Ji Won. - Hold on.

2551
01:59:23,868 --> 01:59:25,168
There aren't buttons.

2552
01:59:27,307 --> 01:59:29,477
You need to listen.

2553
01:59:31,107 --> 01:59:32,677
You look like the chief of a tribe.

2554
01:59:33,347 --> 01:59:34,408
Does it look too big?

2555
01:59:35,177 --> 01:59:36,817
You look stuffy.

2556
01:59:38,147 --> 01:59:39,488
You are being annoying.

2557
01:59:40,118 --> 01:59:43,357
What will people think when they see that outfit?

2558
01:59:44,488 --> 01:59:45,528
"Isn't she hot?"

2559
01:59:46,927 --> 01:59:48,896
(She asks other siblings for help.)

2560
01:59:48,897 --> 01:59:50,397
Does this outfit look strange?

2561
01:59:52,227 --> 01:59:54,328
It's very avant-garde.

2562
01:59:54,597 --> 01:59:57,497
- It's very cute. - I don't know if it suits a date.

2563
01:59:57,498 --> 01:59:58,537
I see.

2564
01:59:58,538 --> 02:00:01,208
Why don't you ask your date?

2565
02:00:01,738 --> 02:00:03,677
I don't think it's Cho A.

2566
02:00:04,278 --> 02:00:05,977
Are you wearing a skirt or pants?

2567
02:00:06,248 --> 02:00:07,977
- Skirt pants? - I wore two.

2568
02:00:08,078 --> 02:00:09,977
- Did you wear two? - Is it too avant-garde?

2569
02:00:10,278 --> 02:00:12,788
Yes. Well, I think you will be hot.

2570
02:00:13,147 --> 02:00:15,048
Ji Won, you are really fashionable.

2571
02:00:15,217 --> 02:00:17,017
My date doesn't like it.

2572
02:00:17,458 --> 02:00:18,517
"What are those?"

2573
02:00:22,998 --> 02:00:26,227
(Taking off)

2574
02:00:27,097 --> 02:00:30,538
(She puts the skirt back in the drawers.)

2575
02:00:32,467 --> 02:00:33,607
Jae Hyung.

2576
02:00:33,807 --> 02:00:35,578
- I am going down. - Okay.

2577
02:00:35,708 --> 02:00:37,878
- I am taking off. - Have fun.

2578
02:00:38,778 --> 02:00:40,778
Shall we get going?

2579
02:00:41,578 --> 02:00:42,578
- Let's go. - Okay.

2580
02:00:43,717 --> 02:00:48,757
(Ji Won and Jae Hyung, Selected date)

2581
02:00:52,887 --> 02:00:54,687
I am so hungry.

2582
02:00:56,158 --> 02:00:57,727
- What do you think? - It's so nice.

2583
02:00:57,798 --> 02:00:58,798
Is it nice?

2584
02:00:58,799 --> 02:01:01,396
It's even better that we are indoor.

2585
02:01:01,397 --> 02:01:04,636
- I know. You get hot very easily. - That's right.

2586
02:01:04,637 --> 02:01:07,507
Let's check the starred items.

2587
02:01:07,908 --> 02:01:08,936
This is what I told you about.

2588
02:01:08,937 --> 02:01:10,806
We can choose the main menu first.

2589
02:01:10,807 --> 02:01:11,907
(Ji Won looked up the menu in advance.)

2590
02:01:11,908 --> 02:01:13,048
Fish and...

2591
02:01:13,477 --> 02:01:14,747
- Beef. - Beef.

2592
02:01:14,748 --> 02:01:16,016
- Those are the options. - Let's go with meat.

2593
02:01:16,017 --> 02:01:17,216
- This one and... - It's so nice.

2594
02:01:17,217 --> 02:01:18,788
- Have you been to Singapore? - Yes.

2595
02:01:19,118 --> 02:01:20,587
- Have you? - Last year.

2596
02:01:20,588 --> 02:01:21,717
It's my first time coming here.

2597
02:01:22,088 --> 02:01:23,217
- Singapore? - Yes.

2598
02:01:23,557 --> 02:01:24,686
(Glancing around)

2599
02:01:24,687 --> 02:01:26,386
(An employee is nowhere to be seen.)

2600
02:01:26,387 --> 02:01:27,557
I will go and ask.

2601
02:01:27,658 --> 02:01:29,957
(Jae Hyung gets up.)

2602
02:01:29,958 --> 02:01:30,958
- Excuse me. - Yes?

2603
02:01:31,698 --> 02:01:33,127
We would like to order.

2604
02:01:33,128 --> 02:01:34,627
My staff will help you.

2605
02:01:34,628 --> 02:01:36,297
- But there is no staff. - I see.

2606
02:01:36,298 --> 02:01:38,097
- Sorry. They are coming. - All right.

2607
02:01:39,908 --> 02:01:40,937
Did you solve the problem?

2608
02:01:42,578 --> 02:01:43,908
(A painful landing)

2609
02:01:46,908 --> 02:01:50,247
Didn't you run and swim too much today?

2610
02:01:50,248 --> 02:01:51,548
My legs are weak.

2611
02:01:51,717 --> 02:01:55,187
You need to hurry up and eat since your legs are weak, right?

2612
02:01:58,727 --> 02:02:00,457
- You have dimples. - Yes.

2613
02:02:00,458 --> 02:02:03,197
- You have them just like Se Seung. - Yes.

2614
02:02:03,198 --> 02:02:06,267
You wore an outfit that's different from your usual style.

2615
02:02:06,427 --> 02:02:08,998
- Me? - Your usual style...

2616
02:02:09,467 --> 02:02:11,668
- had the Gothic vibe. - The Gothic vibe?

2617
02:02:12,168 --> 02:02:14,107
At first, I was...

2618
02:02:14,908 --> 02:02:15,908
a bit scared.

2619
02:02:17,607 --> 02:02:18,807
Aren't you scared today?

2620
02:02:19,078 --> 02:02:21,306
- Today, you look pure. - Do I look pure?

2621
02:02:21,307 --> 02:02:24,447
Ji Won wore an outfit like NewJeans.

2622
02:02:24,448 --> 02:02:25,516
She wore a white T-shirt and jeans.

2623
02:02:25,517 --> 02:02:26,817
I like such outfits.

2624
02:02:27,717 --> 02:02:28,757
You found me scary.

2625
02:02:29,158 --> 02:02:30,556
- As for me... - Not scary.

2626
02:02:30,557 --> 02:02:33,927
When I saw you for the first time, I thought you were free-spirited.

2627
02:02:34,387 --> 02:02:36,226
You entered like this...

2628
02:02:36,227 --> 02:02:38,226
- and slumped into the chair. - Did I slump into the chair?

2629
02:02:38,227 --> 02:02:39,896
- Yes. You slumped into the chair... - Really?

2630
02:02:39,897 --> 02:02:40,998
and looked at me like this.

2631
02:02:42,067 --> 02:02:44,838
Your face screamed, "Who on earth are you?"

2632
02:02:45,908 --> 02:02:48,668
(Ji Won and Jae Hyung's first meeting)

2633
02:02:50,038 --> 02:02:51,176
(Awkward)

2634
02:02:51,177 --> 02:02:52,847
(More awkward)

2635
02:02:53,778 --> 02:02:54,807
Who are you?

2636
02:02:56,177 --> 02:02:58,048
- Go ahead and eat. - Thank you.

2637
02:03:04,288 --> 02:03:05,557
- Do you want this? - Yes.

2638
02:03:05,927 --> 02:03:07,357
I am curious about the taste.

2639
02:03:07,658 --> 02:03:08,997
- I know. - It looks like...

2640
02:03:08,998 --> 02:03:12,226
- jangjorim of Korea. - Yes.

2641
02:03:12,227 --> 02:03:13,266
Did you try this?

2642
02:03:13,267 --> 02:03:14,528
- Not yet. - Do you want some?

2643
02:03:15,668 --> 02:03:17,867
Thank you. I feel like I am at a buffet.

2644
02:03:17,868 --> 02:03:20,767
You should eat it like this.

2645
02:03:21,067 --> 02:03:22,137
Cheese.

2646
02:03:23,507 --> 02:03:26,208
My heart fluttered a bit when he looked after me.

2647
02:03:26,778 --> 02:03:27,778
It's tasty.

2648
02:03:28,408 --> 02:03:30,676
Did you think that I was older or younger?

2649
02:03:30,677 --> 02:03:32,346
At first, I thought you were younger.

2650
02:03:32,347 --> 02:03:33,418
- Really? - Yes.

2651
02:03:33,588 --> 02:03:36,057
I told you that I read your sibling's introduction.

2652
02:03:36,658 --> 02:03:38,687
- Yes. - When I read it carefully,

2653
02:03:38,988 --> 02:03:41,687
I realized that you were probably older than me.

2654
02:03:41,988 --> 02:03:45,868
You weren't as free-spirited as I thought.

2655
02:03:46,097 --> 02:03:50,037
I could see that you were controlling yourself.

2656
02:03:50,038 --> 02:03:51,868
Was I that free-spirited?

2657
02:03:52,038 --> 02:03:53,306
I think I know what it is.

2658
02:03:53,307 --> 02:03:56,437
When I met you for the first time, I felt awkward.

2659
02:03:57,338 --> 02:03:59,577
- Right. - So that side came out more.

2660
02:03:59,578 --> 02:04:02,577
Given your personality, that was probably the case.

2661
02:04:02,578 --> 02:04:05,988
There are people who overreact in order to befriend the others.

2662
02:04:06,387 --> 02:04:07,947
I think I am a bit like that.

2663
02:04:07,948 --> 02:04:10,657
When I got to know you, you were different...

2664
02:04:10,658 --> 02:04:12,357
from what I imagined at first.

2665
02:04:12,557 --> 02:04:15,628
So I wanted to talk to you, but there was no time.

2666
02:04:16,057 --> 02:04:17,227
- You are right. - We never had the opportunity.

2667
02:04:17,698 --> 02:04:19,467
Your eye colour...

2668
02:04:19,528 --> 02:04:21,668
- I am wearing contact lenses. - I see.

2669
02:04:21,998 --> 02:04:23,238
Is the eye colour naturally black?

2670
02:04:23,738 --> 02:04:24,837
Yes, it's black.

2671
02:04:24,838 --> 02:04:26,838
Your eyes look very mysterious.

2672
02:04:27,408 --> 02:04:29,878
What kind of women do you like?

2673
02:04:30,137 --> 02:04:33,948
I like someone who makes me her priority.

2674
02:04:34,007 --> 02:04:37,378
When I am in a relationship, my girlfriend is my priority.

2675
02:04:38,248 --> 02:04:40,448
I don't want to be her everything,

2676
02:04:40,687 --> 02:04:44,957
but it's important to be each other's priority.

2677
02:04:44,958 --> 02:04:46,557
- That's what I think. - I see.

2678
02:04:46,727 --> 02:04:48,257
What's your ideal type?

2679
02:04:48,387 --> 02:04:49,727
I don't know yet.

2680
02:04:49,927 --> 02:04:53,027
I think I like someone cute.

2681
02:04:53,028 --> 02:04:54,396
- Really? - Yes.

2682
02:04:54,397 --> 02:04:56,538
If someone looks cute, I go, "Do I like him?"

2683
02:04:57,298 --> 02:04:58,668
I think that.

2684
02:04:59,467 --> 02:05:01,907
As for the looks, they have always been different.

2685
02:05:01,908 --> 02:05:03,378
You resemble Gong Yoo.

2686
02:05:04,378 --> 02:05:05,408
Stop it.

2687
02:05:07,307 --> 02:05:08,448
Stop it.

2688
02:05:09,418 --> 02:05:12,217
You have a talent in making people flustered.

2689
02:05:12,418 --> 02:05:13,418
Do I?

2690
02:05:14,017 --> 02:05:16,588
Do you have disappointment?

2691
02:05:16,857 --> 02:05:20,487
Five days remain. Is there someone you want to talk to?

2692
02:05:20,488 --> 02:05:22,757
I got to talk to you.

2693
02:05:23,198 --> 02:05:25,298
There is no one else I want to talk to.

2694
02:05:25,897 --> 02:05:27,597
When we saw each other for the first time...

2695
02:05:28,868 --> 02:05:31,137
I think both of us felt that way.

2696
02:05:31,298 --> 02:05:32,636
- "We are too different." - So...

2697
02:05:32,637 --> 02:05:35,738
I thought that we might not get along.

2698
02:05:35,908 --> 02:05:38,137
Because of that, my natural side...

2699
02:05:38,677 --> 02:05:42,418
and the sides I wanted to show didn't come out.

2700
02:05:42,948 --> 02:05:46,647
I think that was why we felt more distant.

2701
02:05:46,948 --> 02:05:49,158
But as we had more exchanges,

2702
02:05:49,387 --> 02:05:51,288
I went, "She is different from what I thought."

2703
02:05:51,857 --> 02:05:54,257
I could feel that.

2704
02:05:54,528 --> 02:05:55,628
I guess our first...

2705
02:05:56,298 --> 02:05:59,328
I guess our first meeting was a miss.

2706
02:05:59,628 --> 02:06:00,897
I am shy.

2707
02:06:01,128 --> 02:06:02,198
- Really? - Yes.

2708
02:06:02,498 --> 02:06:03,936
You were shy around me...

2709
02:06:03,937 --> 02:06:05,636
- for a long time. - That's right.

2710
02:06:05,637 --> 02:06:07,167
- So... - I was a bit sullen.

2711
02:06:07,168 --> 02:06:08,238
Why were you sullen?

2712
02:06:08,668 --> 02:06:10,208
You chose Yong Woo at first.

2713
02:06:11,238 --> 02:06:13,748
Your style of speech was...

2714
02:06:13,847 --> 02:06:15,677
as light as a feather.

2715
02:06:15,817 --> 02:06:16,817
"Who are you?"

2716
02:06:16,818 --> 02:06:18,816
I have two tones.

2717
02:06:18,817 --> 02:06:20,048
The first one is this.

2718
02:06:20,618 --> 02:06:22,418
"Really?" The second one is this.

2719
02:06:22,658 --> 02:06:24,087
You used the second tone that day.

2720
02:06:24,088 --> 02:06:25,487
You probably thought that I was a villain.

2721
02:06:25,488 --> 02:06:27,727
That's right.

2722
02:06:29,727 --> 02:06:31,498
- My goodness. - Gosh.

2723
02:06:31,597 --> 02:06:33,667
Don't people usually cover their mouths when they laugh?

2724
02:06:33,668 --> 02:06:34,668
Why did he cover his eyes?

2725
02:06:34,669 --> 02:06:36,337
He had to show his dimples.

2726
02:06:36,338 --> 02:06:37,338
That's right.

2727
02:06:37,339 --> 02:06:38,538
- The dimples. - She said that they were charming.

2728
02:06:39,868 --> 02:06:41,966
- He had to show them. - Jonathan, you are cute.

2729
02:06:41,967 --> 02:06:43,238
(Jonathan, you are cute.)

2730
02:06:44,208 --> 02:06:45,208
That's right.

2731
02:06:46,807 --> 02:06:49,317
I was like, "What's up with him?"

2732
02:06:49,418 --> 02:06:51,816
Let's hurry up and go back to Sinsa.

2733
02:06:51,817 --> 02:06:53,346
Shall we go back and start over?

2734
02:06:53,347 --> 02:06:54,347
Yes.

2735
02:06:54,348 --> 02:06:57,887
There are good things that come from unexpectedness.

2736
02:06:59,257 --> 02:07:01,587
(Is Ji Won close to your ideal type?)

2737
02:07:01,588 --> 02:07:03,798
At first, she was far from my ideal type.

2738
02:07:04,328 --> 02:07:06,498
But talking to her made me realize...

2739
02:07:07,028 --> 02:07:09,967
that she definitely was close to my ideal type.

2740
02:07:10,238 --> 02:07:15,006
I found out that he also waited for a date with me.

2741
02:07:15,007 --> 02:07:19,378
We were curious about each other.

2742
02:07:24,948 --> 02:07:26,588
If you want water, I have water.

2743
02:07:26,817 --> 02:07:28,887
I have mouthwash and wet wipes too.

2744
02:07:30,057 --> 02:07:31,288
You are like Doraemon.

2745
02:07:31,988 --> 02:07:32,988
That's right.

2746
02:07:32,989 --> 02:07:35,756
I figured that the weather would continue being like this,

2747
02:07:35,757 --> 02:07:37,057
so it's okay.

2748
02:07:37,557 --> 02:07:40,467
It's atmospheric and warm.

2749
02:07:41,397 --> 02:07:43,097
Are you tired by any chance?

2750
02:07:43,437 --> 02:07:45,807
- Why? Do I look tired? - No.

2751
02:07:46,168 --> 02:07:47,966
What? He seems like a different person.

2752
02:07:47,967 --> 02:07:48,967
It's my first time seeing him like this.

2753
02:07:48,968 --> 02:07:50,806
- It's our first time seeing it. - He seems like a stranger.

2754
02:07:50,807 --> 02:07:51,807
It's our first time seeing it.

2755
02:07:51,808 --> 02:07:55,408
So that's what Jae Hyung is like in his boyfriend mode.

2756
02:07:56,477 --> 02:07:57,918
We are finally seeing it.

2757
02:07:58,048 --> 02:07:59,816
He is like a bulldozer.

2758
02:07:59,817 --> 02:08:01,287
He did say that he was like a bulldozer.

2759
02:08:01,288 --> 02:08:02,757
What's up with Jae Hyung?

2760
02:08:02,958 --> 02:08:05,088
I was so surprised when he asked, "Are you tired?"

2761
02:08:06,328 --> 02:08:08,257
Are you tired by any chance?

2762
02:08:08,658 --> 02:08:10,897
- Why? Do I look tired? - No.

2763
02:08:11,097 --> 02:08:13,528
I want to understand you better.

2764
02:08:13,927 --> 02:08:16,197
I want to know if you are tired...

2765
02:08:16,198 --> 02:08:17,538
- or... - I am not tired.

2766
02:08:17,967 --> 02:08:20,266
- if you are calm. - I am not tired.

2767
02:08:20,267 --> 02:08:21,937
I am just absorbed in the mood.

2768
02:08:25,208 --> 02:08:27,947
(They arrive at the next location of the date.)

2769
02:08:27,948 --> 02:08:29,918
- Thank you. - It's the gondola.

2770
02:08:30,017 --> 02:08:31,618
- That one? - Yes.

2771
02:08:31,918 --> 02:08:35,248
(Ji Won and Jae Hyung, Attraction)

2772
02:08:36,717 --> 02:08:38,988
(Once you reach the top,)

2773
02:08:40,088 --> 02:08:43,557
(you get nice scenery.)

2774
02:08:45,328 --> 02:08:46,897
It won't drop, will it?

2775
02:08:47,498 --> 02:08:48,498
(My goodness)

2776
02:08:48,499 --> 02:08:49,937
It...

2777
02:08:50,738 --> 02:08:51,868
won't be scary, right?

2778
02:08:51,998 --> 02:08:53,208
- Are you scared? - Yes.

2779
02:08:53,437 --> 02:08:55,767
- I am nervous. - Is your heart beating fast?

2780
02:08:56,477 --> 02:08:57,607
I am not scared.

2781
02:08:57,838 --> 02:08:59,647
I booked an intense attraction.

2782
02:09:01,307 --> 02:09:04,516
Judging by how we can put drinks here,

2783
02:09:04,517 --> 02:09:05,887
I guess it won't go upside down.

2784
02:09:06,017 --> 02:09:08,448
Go upside down?

2785
02:09:08,918 --> 02:09:10,458
It won't go upside down.

2786
02:09:10,717 --> 02:09:13,158
- Then... - It just gives us a good view.

2787
02:09:13,557 --> 02:09:14,757
- Really? - Yes.

2788
02:09:14,988 --> 02:09:16,027
I am not scared.

2789
02:09:16,028 --> 02:09:17,056
- Right? - Yes.

2790
02:09:17,057 --> 02:09:18,057
Can I feel...

2791
02:09:18,828 --> 02:09:19,967
your heartbeat?

2792
02:09:24,038 --> 02:09:25,198
My heart is here.

2793
02:09:27,567 --> 02:09:29,477
- Why is it beating so fast? - It's beating so fast.

2794
02:09:42,347 --> 02:09:43,987
- It's slow. It goes up slowly. - It's slow.

2795
02:09:43,988 --> 02:09:46,686
I thought it would go up fast like Gyro Drop.

2796
02:09:46,687 --> 02:09:48,357
(Relieved)

2797
02:09:48,458 --> 02:09:52,097
Directions so that you can see the whole...

2798
02:09:53,927 --> 02:09:56,538
- With the instructions... - My goodness.

2799
02:09:57,437 --> 02:09:58,566
(Fidgeting)

2800
02:09:58,567 --> 02:09:59,637
It's okay, right?

2801
02:09:59,807 --> 02:10:01,738
It's a bit scary when I look down directly.

2802
02:10:02,738 --> 02:10:04,437
- You are right. - Are you scared?

2803
02:10:05,278 --> 02:10:06,577
- I am good. - Don't look down.

2804
02:10:06,578 --> 02:10:08,477
(Not good)

2805
02:10:09,347 --> 02:10:10,347
(Glancing down)

2806
02:10:12,347 --> 02:10:14,516
(They came up pretty high.)

2807
02:10:14,517 --> 02:10:16,217
- Jae Hyung, look down. - No.

2808
02:10:17,687 --> 02:10:18,988
(They reach the top.)

2809
02:10:21,128 --> 02:10:22,527
(My goodness)

2810
02:10:22,528 --> 02:10:23,528
(Laughing)

2811
02:10:25,227 --> 02:10:26,997
- I can't look down. - You know,

2812
02:10:26,998 --> 02:10:29,066
I hope it doesn't drop suddenly.

2813
02:10:29,067 --> 02:10:30,668
What? No. I hope it doesn't do that.

2814
02:10:33,538 --> 02:10:35,607
Why are you putting the feet together?

2815
02:10:37,738 --> 02:10:40,448
(He plucks up his courage and takes a photo.)

2816
02:10:41,307 --> 02:10:42,647
All right.

2817
02:10:47,448 --> 02:10:48,788
It's nice.

2818
02:10:50,418 --> 02:10:51,817
- It's cool today. - yes.

2819
02:10:52,317 --> 02:10:53,687
Are you scared of height?

2820
02:10:53,988 --> 02:10:55,028
- Scared? - No.

2821
02:10:55,427 --> 02:10:57,056
Next time, try bungee jumping.

2822
02:10:57,057 --> 02:10:58,227
Bungee jumping?

2823
02:10:58,857 --> 02:11:00,798
No. Not in my life.

2824
02:11:04,498 --> 02:11:05,738
Take off your hands.

2825
02:11:13,507 --> 02:11:16,747
It was cute to see Jae Hyung so scared.

2826
02:11:16,748 --> 02:11:19,686
He even sweated.

2827
02:11:19,687 --> 02:11:22,657
He stuck his arms and legs to the attraction.

2828
02:11:22,658 --> 02:11:25,886
He was very scared.

2829
02:11:25,887 --> 02:11:28,427
I thought it was fun and cute.

2830
02:11:29,698 --> 02:11:30,757
I wasn't scared.

2831
02:11:31,727 --> 02:11:34,668
(Were you really not scared?)

2832
02:11:36,567 --> 02:11:38,267
I was... Yes, I was scared.

2833
02:11:40,338 --> 02:11:41,567
I am sure it showed.

2834
02:11:42,007 --> 02:11:43,507
I felt nauseous when I looked down.

2835
02:11:43,677 --> 02:11:46,476
My brother has a bad fear of heights too.

2836
02:11:46,477 --> 02:11:47,477
- Really? - Yes.

2837
02:11:47,478 --> 02:11:48,846
I don't have a fear of heights.

2838
02:11:48,847 --> 02:11:50,476
What are you talking about?

2839
02:11:50,477 --> 02:11:51,846
- I can look ahead. - This is...

2840
02:11:51,847 --> 02:11:53,816
what we call a fear of heights.

2841
02:11:53,817 --> 02:11:55,217
(He hurts his elbow.)

2842
02:11:55,488 --> 02:11:57,488
I can't even look at my elbow.

2843
02:11:57,658 --> 02:11:59,528
That's a fear of heights.

2844
02:12:00,387 --> 02:12:02,427
(Despite being scared, they take a photo together.)

2845
02:12:04,757 --> 02:12:06,427
Jae Hyung who is quaking in fear.

2846
02:12:09,597 --> 02:12:12,338
- Jae Hyung, why did you... - I look so stiff.

2847
02:12:15,767 --> 02:12:17,708
(They ask the employee to take a photo.)

2848
02:12:18,177 --> 02:12:19,208
My goodness.

2849
02:12:19,378 --> 02:12:21,107
(His face turns pale.)

2850
02:12:23,347 --> 02:12:25,618
Weren't you startled? I was so startled.

2851
02:12:26,248 --> 02:12:28,118
One, two...

2852
02:12:37,597 --> 02:12:38,797
Shall we go down?

2853
02:12:38,798 --> 02:12:40,028
- Yes, please. - Yes.

2854
02:12:40,298 --> 02:12:41,327
"Please."

2855
02:12:41,328 --> 02:12:42,897
(They finally begin to go down.)

2856
02:12:44,538 --> 02:12:45,668
I broke into a cold sweat.

2857
02:12:49,208 --> 02:12:51,208
It's nice to look ahead,

2858
02:12:51,338 --> 02:12:52,338
but I can't look below my feet.

2859
02:12:52,339 --> 02:12:53,607
- You can't look below your feet. - No.

2860
02:12:54,278 --> 02:12:56,146
Something scarier remains. What will you do?

2861
02:12:56,147 --> 02:12:57,147
Really?

2862
02:12:57,618 --> 02:12:58,778
Are we going bungee jumping?

2863
02:12:59,918 --> 02:13:01,448
Due to the rain, we won't be able to go bungee jumping.

2864
02:13:01,748 --> 02:13:03,288
- Are you serious? - Yes.

2865
02:13:03,618 --> 02:13:05,657
(They safely arrive on the ground.)

2866
02:13:05,658 --> 02:13:06,658
It was nothing.

2867
02:13:06,659 --> 02:13:07,686
- Was it nothing? - Yes.

2868
02:13:07,687 --> 02:13:09,128
Then you will do a good job with the next one.

2869
02:13:09,227 --> 02:13:10,557
Of course. What's the next one?

2870
02:13:11,158 --> 02:13:12,198
It's so hip.

2871
02:13:12,998 --> 02:13:14,698
It's so hip. My goodness.

2872
02:13:15,328 --> 02:13:16,636
- It suits you so well. - Is there a mirror?

2873
02:13:16,637 --> 02:13:17,667
Really?

2874
02:13:17,668 --> 02:13:18,698
- What do you think? - You should put it on too.

2875
02:13:19,937 --> 02:13:20,966
Put it on.

2876
02:13:20,967 --> 02:13:22,137
(He recommends a flower headband.)

2877
02:13:28,107 --> 02:13:30,578
You are making me try on the strangest things.

2878
02:13:30,847 --> 02:13:31,918
How about this?

2879
02:13:32,177 --> 02:13:33,316
(He finds a bracelet he wants.)

2880
02:13:33,317 --> 02:13:35,387
It's hip, Jae Hyung.

2881
02:13:36,687 --> 02:13:37,757
It's pretty.

2882
02:13:38,257 --> 02:13:39,887
I think this star is pretty.

2883
02:13:40,128 --> 02:13:41,926
You want it for real, right?

2884
02:13:41,927 --> 02:13:42,927
Yes.

2885
02:13:43,658 --> 02:13:44,698
What is it?

2886
02:13:45,927 --> 02:13:47,127
- Let's get this one. - Okay.

2887
02:13:47,128 --> 02:13:48,267
(The shiny bracelet captivates him.)

2888
02:13:48,427 --> 02:13:50,237
- Mango. - Mango.

2889
02:13:50,238 --> 02:13:53,208
- How about you? - Shall I get pineapple?

2890
02:13:54,067 --> 02:13:55,467
An ice cream-buying...

2891
02:13:55,708 --> 02:13:56,936
An ice cream-buying... What?

2892
02:13:56,937 --> 02:13:58,238
- Finish the sentence. - Pretty woman.

2893
02:13:59,278 --> 02:14:01,647
You were going to say "An ice cream-buying woman."

2894
02:14:01,807 --> 02:14:02,817
No.

2895
02:14:03,248 --> 02:14:05,717
- An ice cream-buying pretty girl. - Pretty girl.

2896
02:14:05,847 --> 02:14:08,846
That ruins the vibe.

2897
02:14:08,847 --> 02:14:09,988
- Yes. "Woman" is better. - Right?

2898
02:14:10,217 --> 02:14:12,217
- Here you go. - Thank you.

2899
02:14:12,418 --> 02:14:13,687
- Let's wear the bracelet. - Okay.

2900
02:14:14,458 --> 02:14:16,356
(He puts the bracelet on Ji Won first.)

2901
02:14:16,357 --> 02:14:17,926
- Is it too tight? - The second one.

2902
02:14:17,927 --> 02:14:19,467
- Is it okay? - I think it should be tight.

2903
02:14:25,767 --> 02:14:28,908
It's like a bracelet babies wear so that they don't get lost.

2904
02:14:28,967 --> 02:14:30,436
- Don't lose me. - I won't.

2905
02:14:30,437 --> 02:14:33,078
Turn on the shiny function.

2906
02:14:35,408 --> 02:14:36,418
Thank you.

2907
02:14:37,078 --> 02:14:39,717
(Date on the 2nd day in Singapore)

2908
02:14:39,988 --> 02:14:42,287
(- It's so much fun! - It's so much fun.)

2909
02:14:42,288 --> 02:14:43,617
(You are good.)

2910
02:14:43,618 --> 02:14:45,016
(I ride this to work.)

2911
02:14:45,017 --> 02:14:46,056
(Laughing)

2912
02:14:46,057 --> 02:14:47,787
(As I spend time with you today,)

2913
02:14:47,788 --> 02:14:49,997
(I thought that I chose really well.)

2914
02:14:49,998 --> 02:14:53,266
(It was the most fun I had since joining the show.)

2915
02:14:53,267 --> 02:14:56,798
(I felt like time was passing fast.)

2916
02:14:57,368 --> 02:14:58,596
(For the first time,)

2917
02:14:58,597 --> 02:15:00,106
(I felt disappointed...)

2918
02:15:00,107 --> 02:15:04,007
(that the date ended.)

2919
02:15:05,977 --> 02:15:07,207
(Ji Won.)

2920
02:15:07,208 --> 02:15:08,646
(Do you want to have a drink with me?)

2921
02:15:08,647 --> 02:15:10,417
(Okay.)

2922
02:15:10,418 --> 02:15:13,016
(The two of them head over to the terrace.)

2923
02:15:13,017 --> 02:15:15,917
(It got on my nerves.)

2924
02:15:15,918 --> 02:15:17,886
(I don't know...)

2925
02:15:17,887 --> 02:15:19,657
(what my emotions will be.)

2926
02:15:19,658 --> 02:15:22,127
(I want to follow my heart...)

2927
02:15:22,128 --> 02:15:23,128
(now.)

2928
02:15:25,397 --> 02:15:27,927
(4 days until the final decision)
