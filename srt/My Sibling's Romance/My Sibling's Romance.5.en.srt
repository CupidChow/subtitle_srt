1
00:00:00,086 --> 00:00:01,816
(The men had time to themselves for the first time since moving in.)

2
00:00:01,817 --> 00:00:02,817
(You're just like me.)

3
00:00:02,818 --> 00:00:04,116
(You're so cute.)

4
00:00:04,117 --> 00:00:05,886
(Me?)

5
00:00:05,887 --> 00:00:07,425
(The moment when bromance was overflowing, )

6
00:00:07,426 --> 00:00:09,597
(someone requested a secret date.)

7
00:00:12,396 --> 00:00:14,727
(A ten-minute date with a new participant)

8
00:00:14,797 --> 00:00:16,366
(My name is Ji Won.)

9
00:00:16,367 --> 00:00:18,405
(A new participant, Ji Won)

10
00:00:18,406 --> 00:00:19,636
(It was so heart-fluttering.)

11
00:00:19,637 --> 00:00:21,206
(It was an impressive encounter.)

12
00:00:21,207 --> 00:00:23,776
(She left a good first impression.)

13
00:00:23,777 --> 00:00:28,916
(The message asking me who made my heart flutter today...)

14
00:00:28,917 --> 00:00:30,745
(really made me think.)

15
00:00:30,746 --> 00:00:35,016
(Did their feelings change?)

16
00:00:35,017 --> 00:00:36,556
(The news that was relayed to their siblings as well)

17
00:00:36,557 --> 00:00:38,855
("A new participant who chose Yong Woo as a date...")

18
00:00:38,856 --> 00:00:42,197
("arrived at the door.")

19
00:00:42,426 --> 00:00:45,225
- Hello. - Hello.

20
00:00:45,226 --> 00:00:47,725
(A very pretty woman who resembled a cat)

21
00:00:47,726 --> 00:00:50,096
(She seemed haughty.)

22
00:00:50,097 --> 00:00:51,196
(I thought that she was my brother's type...)

23
00:00:51,197 --> 00:00:52,305
(the moment I saw her.)

24
00:00:52,306 --> 00:00:54,505
(My sister can't lose him.)

25
00:00:54,506 --> 00:00:58,606
(Ji Won chose Yong Woo as her date for tomorrow's Benefit Date.)

26
00:00:58,607 --> 00:01:00,746
(I chose him because he's someone I want to experience liking...)

27
00:01:00,747 --> 00:01:03,846
(and someone I want to date.)

28
00:01:03,847 --> 00:01:06,486
(Yong Woo is lucky.)

29
00:01:06,487 --> 00:01:09,516
(Yong Woo goes to bed for tomorrow's date with Ji Won.)

30
00:01:09,517 --> 00:01:13,086
(The day that has become a lot more complicated ends.)

31
00:01:14,327 --> 00:01:18,726
(The morning with the first snow)

32
00:01:21,026 --> 00:01:23,237
I must be crazy. What should I do?

33
00:01:24,567 --> 00:01:27,966
(Cho A who slept in goes to work.)

34
00:01:27,967 --> 00:01:30,006
(Se Seung, Ju Yeon, and Ji Won's room)

35
00:01:31,847 --> 00:01:34,407
(Ji Won wakes up.)

36
00:01:35,377 --> 00:01:36,747
(Being careful)

37
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:42,586
(She goes on the bed quietly.)

38
00:01:43,487 --> 00:01:45,807
(She dries her hair with a towel instead of a hair dryer.)

39
00:01:46,426 --> 00:01:48,555
- She has a totally different vibe. - She feels totally different.

40
00:01:48,556 --> 00:01:50,456
- She looks so young. - She looks a lot more beautiful.

41
00:01:50,457 --> 00:01:52,166
You're right.

42
00:01:53,426 --> 00:01:54,767
(Turning)

43
00:01:55,067 --> 00:01:56,497
- Ji Won. - Yes?

44
00:01:57,266 --> 00:02:00,105
You can use the hair dryer in the morning.

45
00:02:00,106 --> 00:02:01,676
- Really? - Yes, because...

46
00:02:01,677 --> 00:02:03,276
I was thinking of that now.

47
00:02:03,277 --> 00:02:06,446
Because we agreed not to care about what others do...

48
00:02:06,706 --> 00:02:09,076
in the morning to get ready.

49
00:02:09,277 --> 00:02:11,717
You can just do it here.

50
00:02:12,117 --> 00:02:13,347
Make yourself at home.

51
00:02:21,356 --> 00:02:24,255
(She makes herself at home...)

52
00:02:24,256 --> 00:02:27,196
(and gets ready for her date with Yong Woo.)

53
00:02:29,837 --> 00:02:32,837
I think I lost sleep last night,

54
00:02:33,006 --> 00:02:35,205
but I still felt refreshed.

55
00:02:35,206 --> 00:02:37,136
I was already having a bit of fun.

56
00:02:37,606 --> 00:02:39,776
I was half-expectant and half-worried...

57
00:02:39,777 --> 00:02:43,016
as I prepared for the date with Yong Woo.

58
00:02:43,546 --> 00:02:45,516
(Yong Woo wakes up.)

59
00:02:52,027 --> 00:02:54,057
(He starts his morning exercise.)

60
00:02:57,927 --> 00:02:58,966
(Jonathan)

61
00:02:58,967 --> 00:03:00,295
- Can he get in the pose right away? - For the date.

62
00:03:00,296 --> 00:03:01,837
He's pumping his muscles for the date.

63
00:03:02,997 --> 00:03:04,467
He's so tall.

64
00:03:23,657 --> 00:03:25,285
Why is he working out at the place where everyone can see?

65
00:03:25,286 --> 00:03:26,832
Why is he working out in the living room?

66
00:03:26,856 --> 00:03:28,156
Maybe he can't work out in the room...

67
00:03:28,157 --> 00:03:29,455
- because he's too tall. - That's right.

68
00:03:29,456 --> 00:03:31,416
He can't do it in the room because he's too tall.

69
00:03:31,726 --> 00:03:34,097
(Jung Sub has his research presentation today.)

70
00:03:36,036 --> 00:03:38,907
(Sub goes to work.)

71
00:03:42,337 --> 00:03:43,437
(Surprised)

72
00:04:05,526 --> 00:04:06,965
(Three days ago)

73
00:04:06,966 --> 00:04:08,126
(When it rains or snows, )

74
00:04:08,127 --> 00:04:09,667
(express your feelings in any way...)

75
00:04:10,237 --> 00:04:12,905
(to the person you like.)

76
00:04:12,906 --> 00:04:16,406
(They agreed to express their feelings when it snowed.)

77
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:19,546
I woke up in the morning alone...

78
00:04:19,547 --> 00:04:22,876
and was putting on some makeup, and it was snowing outside.

79
00:04:22,877 --> 00:04:24,116
But Jung Sub...

80
00:04:24,117 --> 00:04:27,646
would have already been giving his presentation by then.

81
00:04:28,047 --> 00:04:29,986
It was snowing so prettily.

82
00:04:29,987 --> 00:04:32,356
I didn't know what to do.

83
00:04:32,357 --> 00:04:34,487
The recipient was decided, but I didn't know how.

84
00:04:35,857 --> 00:04:37,297
I thought hard about it.

85
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:40,396
It's really snowing.

86
00:04:53,146 --> 00:04:55,977
(Cheol Hyeon)

87
00:04:58,917 --> 00:05:00,687
(Ju Yeon)

88
00:05:03,687 --> 00:05:06,026
(Jung Sub)

89
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:09,696
(Se Seung)

90
00:05:12,766 --> 00:05:14,367
(Cho A)

91
00:05:16,937 --> 00:05:18,966
(Yun Ha)

92
00:05:22,006 --> 00:05:23,537
(Jae Hyung)

93
00:05:26,906 --> 00:05:28,247
(Yong Woo)

94
00:05:32,487 --> 00:05:33,846
(Ji Won)

95
00:05:37,516 --> 00:05:41,797
(My Sibling's Romance)

96
00:05:43,396 --> 00:05:47,696
(Episode 5: At the First Snow)

97
00:05:57,206 --> 00:05:58,807
- It's snowing a lot. - How...

98
00:05:59,177 --> 00:06:00,977
- It's the first snow. - Exactly.

99
00:06:09,886 --> 00:06:11,586
- It's snowing a lot. - How...

100
00:06:11,826 --> 00:06:13,987
- The first snow is falling now. - Exactly.

101
00:06:18,026 --> 00:06:21,226
The first snow fell, so my heart fluttered.

102
00:06:21,227 --> 00:06:25,607
Is this the sign that I can meet someone nice here?

103
00:06:28,636 --> 00:06:30,437
Go that way.

104
00:06:36,117 --> 00:06:38,845
The snowflakes are bigger than I thought.

105
00:06:38,846 --> 00:06:40,886
- Exactly. It's snowing heavily. - Yes.

106
00:06:42,117 --> 00:06:43,817
It seems to have gotten warmer...

107
00:06:44,187 --> 00:06:46,026
now that it's snowing.

108
00:06:47,357 --> 00:06:49,096
It seems to be blocking my view.

109
00:06:49,727 --> 00:06:51,427
- Did it get in your eyes? - My eyes...

110
00:06:52,567 --> 00:06:53,766
It hit me.

111
00:06:56,336 --> 00:06:57,796
It's so romantic.

112
00:06:57,797 --> 00:06:59,606
- The first snow on the first date. - My gosh.

113
00:06:59,607 --> 00:07:01,005
They look good in the snow.

114
00:07:01,006 --> 00:07:04,176
Exactly. By the way, Yong Woo is so cool.

115
00:07:04,177 --> 00:07:05,405
Their height difference is just right...

116
00:07:05,406 --> 00:07:07,966
- to make your heart flutter. - That's a nice height difference.

117
00:07:15,787 --> 00:07:19,526
It's quite fascinating because we wished...

118
00:07:20,487 --> 00:07:21,926
- for the snow to fall. - Exactly.

119
00:07:21,927 --> 00:07:23,647
We thought it would be nice for it to snow.

120
00:07:23,727 --> 00:07:25,526
- I heard that you decided... - Yes.

121
00:07:25,966 --> 00:07:27,926
To express your feelings to the person you liked...

122
00:07:27,927 --> 00:07:29,497
- when it snowed. - Right.

123
00:07:29,937 --> 00:07:31,866
Yes, we talked about that last time.

124
00:07:31,867 --> 00:07:33,666
- It's so... - To do something when it snowed.

125
00:07:33,667 --> 00:07:34,667
- I... - As soon as you come.

126
00:07:34,668 --> 00:07:36,807
Isn't it too soon for me when I just arrived?

127
00:07:37,706 --> 00:07:39,177
This is bad.

128
00:07:40,607 --> 00:07:43,047
The car is a bit tall.

129
00:07:43,716 --> 00:07:45,236
- We're taking this car. - Is that so?

130
00:07:45,487 --> 00:07:48,817
It should be easier to get in this way.

131
00:07:49,956 --> 00:07:51,756
Like that. You're good.

132
00:08:04,537 --> 00:08:05,817
Have you ridden this car before?

133
00:08:05,937 --> 00:08:07,167
No.

134
00:08:07,567 --> 00:08:10,047
- I got in quite easily, didn't I? - Yes, you were quite good.

135
00:08:10,177 --> 00:08:12,145
- Have you had a good sleep? - Yes, I slept really well.

136
00:08:12,146 --> 00:08:13,476
- Like a log? - Like a log.

137
00:08:13,477 --> 00:08:14,807
Instead, I woke up quite early.

138
00:08:14,906 --> 00:08:17,015
Since you slept well, you shouldn't be tired.

139
00:08:17,016 --> 00:08:18,345
I didn't get to sleep for long.

140
00:08:18,346 --> 00:08:20,616
Since you didn't sleep for long, do you want to go home?

141
00:08:20,846 --> 00:08:21,886
- Me? - Yes.

142
00:08:21,887 --> 00:08:22,986
Do you know how to drive?

143
00:08:23,287 --> 00:08:24,387
Seriously.

144
00:08:25,187 --> 00:08:26,526
I'm a good driver though.

145
00:08:26,527 --> 00:08:27,585
- Are you a good driver? - Yes.

146
00:08:27,586 --> 00:08:29,157
Should we change seats?

147
00:08:30,196 --> 00:08:32,626
If you insist so strongly, I can't help but change.

148
00:08:33,226 --> 00:08:35,466
Since you say you're a good driver, I am rather curious.

149
00:08:37,567 --> 00:08:39,136
- Let's go. - Okay.

150
00:08:39,137 --> 00:08:40,217
(They head to Jebu Island.)

151
00:08:41,167 --> 00:08:42,576
You look like a good driver.

152
00:08:42,777 --> 00:08:46,206
I started working as a manager first,

153
00:08:46,346 --> 00:08:49,116
- Is that so? - so there's no way I can't drive.

154
00:08:49,376 --> 00:08:52,017
I even drove a Starex limousine.

155
00:08:52,387 --> 00:08:54,346
Do you like any idol groups?

156
00:08:54,547 --> 00:08:55,917
- Idol group? - Yes.

157
00:08:55,986 --> 00:08:57,257
Don't you like any idol groups?

158
00:08:57,817 --> 00:09:00,187
I don't think I'm into idol groups.

159
00:09:00,486 --> 00:09:03,825
- I like Cha Eun Woo. - Cha Eun Woo is...

160
00:09:03,826 --> 00:09:05,465
I saw him shedding tears...

161
00:09:05,466 --> 00:09:08,835
in a variety show,

162
00:09:08,836 --> 00:09:10,336
- Really? - and I started liking him.

163
00:09:11,767 --> 00:09:13,465
I like people who cry a lot.

164
00:09:13,466 --> 00:09:15,106
Do you like people who cry a lot?

165
00:09:16,937 --> 00:09:20,076
(The memories of two days ago brushes past his head.)

166
00:09:20,777 --> 00:09:22,517
"He started difficult studies."

167
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:25,686
- Yong Woo is her type. - Oh, dear.

168
00:09:25,687 --> 00:09:26,945
She should've seen this.

169
00:09:26,946 --> 00:09:29,163
- She should've seen this. - Yong Woo fits the description.

170
00:09:29,187 --> 00:09:31,585
I like people who shed...

171
00:09:31,586 --> 00:09:32,855
big tears.

172
00:09:32,856 --> 00:09:34,256
(That person is here.)

173
00:09:34,257 --> 00:09:35,287
Why?

174
00:09:35,726 --> 00:09:36,896
- Sorry? - Is it strange?

175
00:09:36,897 --> 00:09:38,996
No. Suddenly,

176
00:09:40,027 --> 00:09:41,466
I was reminded of something.

177
00:09:43,267 --> 00:09:44,496
I see.

178
00:09:44,736 --> 00:09:47,605
- I'm not saying I like a crybaby. - Okay.

179
00:09:47,606 --> 00:09:50,307
(The crybaby has nothing to say.)

180
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:52,476
It was snowing, but now it stopped.

181
00:09:53,547 --> 00:09:55,446
The snow stopped for me to drive comfortably.

182
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:57,416
That's true.

183
00:09:57,417 --> 00:09:58,985
What are you like when you date?

184
00:09:58,986 --> 00:10:03,317
Are you the type to lead? Or...

185
00:10:03,616 --> 00:10:05,115
I do it naturally.

186
00:10:05,116 --> 00:10:08,527
You said you dated a lot of older women, right?

187
00:10:08,856 --> 00:10:10,456
I didn't date a lot.

188
00:10:11,397 --> 00:10:13,266
- Quite a bit. - Well, yes.

189
00:10:13,267 --> 00:10:16,866
There's just a bit of an age difference,

190
00:10:16,996 --> 00:10:19,407
but I treated them all the same.

191
00:10:20,307 --> 00:10:22,437
- Are you an affectionate type? - Affectionate?

192
00:10:22,807 --> 00:10:23,937
Are you not at all?

193
00:10:24,677 --> 00:10:28,047
(He is rather affectionate.)

194
00:10:28,547 --> 00:10:32,786
My roommate Jae Hyung is very affectionate.

195
00:10:32,787 --> 00:10:34,615
- Jae Hyung? - He's full of affection.

196
00:10:34,616 --> 00:10:35,757
Really?

197
00:10:35,856 --> 00:10:37,887
- Will you hug me? - I will.

198
00:10:39,486 --> 00:10:42,096
He drives me crazy. When I see him...

199
00:10:42,527 --> 00:10:45,256
- He drives me crazy. - You want to bite him.

200
00:10:45,257 --> 00:10:47,366
He's very cute.

201
00:10:48,326 --> 00:10:49,636
- That's something... - I see.

202
00:10:49,637 --> 00:10:52,137
That I don't really have,

203
00:10:53,137 --> 00:10:54,167
so I like it.

204
00:10:54,767 --> 00:10:56,037
- Jae Hyung. - Yes.

205
00:10:56,177 --> 00:10:59,307
So Jae Hyung is the cute type.

206
00:11:00,007 --> 00:11:01,567
I heard that he was a very good singer.

207
00:11:01,606 --> 00:11:02,745
Really?

208
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:04,626
Let's listen to him singing together next time.

209
00:11:05,346 --> 00:11:09,316
I think you would go well with people...

210
00:11:09,317 --> 00:11:10,916
who are lively.

211
00:11:10,917 --> 00:11:12,926
- Me? - Because...

212
00:11:12,927 --> 00:11:14,786
you seem to be a calm type too.

213
00:11:14,787 --> 00:11:17,056
- Are you not? Are you hiding it? - I...

214
00:11:17,057 --> 00:11:18,225
I really like pulling pranks.

215
00:11:18,226 --> 00:11:20,695
Are you a naughty type? Are you hiding your fangs now?

216
00:11:20,696 --> 00:11:23,466
Just know that I'm always looking for the opportunity.

217
00:11:23,667 --> 00:11:25,095
- You like pulling pranks, right? - Me?

218
00:11:25,096 --> 00:11:26,906
I really like it.

219
00:11:26,907 --> 00:11:29,575
But it's fun only when the recipient reacts well.

220
00:11:29,576 --> 00:11:32,036
That's right. There are those who react well.

221
00:11:32,037 --> 00:11:33,277
People with good reactions.

222
00:11:33,446 --> 00:11:34,446
That's right.

223
00:11:35,446 --> 00:11:37,876
Pick one between a mountain and a sea.

224
00:11:38,017 --> 00:11:39,446
- I pick a sea. - A sea?

225
00:11:39,547 --> 00:11:41,016
- You like a mountain, don't you? - Let's go with a mountain behind...

226
00:11:41,017 --> 00:11:42,047
and a sea in front.

227
00:11:43,486 --> 00:11:45,825
We seem to be similar...

228
00:11:45,826 --> 00:11:47,266
but very different at the same time.

229
00:11:47,427 --> 00:11:48,656
- I think so too. - Right?

230
00:11:48,657 --> 00:11:50,526
- Yes. - We seem very similar...

231
00:11:50,527 --> 00:11:51,626
but also very different.

232
00:11:52,567 --> 00:11:55,226
Think carefully about what you want to order at the café.

233
00:11:55,466 --> 00:11:56,636
- The café? - Yes.

234
00:11:56,637 --> 00:11:58,495
(They arrive at the café before heading to Jebu Island.)

235
00:11:58,496 --> 00:12:00,606
- Things to eat. - Things to eat?

236
00:12:01,037 --> 00:12:02,307
It's pretty.

237
00:12:03,137 --> 00:12:05,437
- It's a hanok café. - It's pretty.

238
00:12:07,177 --> 00:12:11,116
(Ji Won and Yong Woo at Jebu Island's hanok café)

239
00:12:19,326 --> 00:12:22,157
The atmosphere's insane.

240
00:12:24,897 --> 00:12:27,027
They even have a water mill, right?

241
00:12:27,167 --> 00:12:28,196
It's pretty.

242
00:12:29,866 --> 00:12:32,036
- Thank you. - Enjoy.

243
00:12:32,037 --> 00:12:33,407
- Okay. - Thank you.

244
00:12:35,736 --> 00:12:37,506
Would you like me to cut it like a steak...

245
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:39,575
or like a pork cutlet?

246
00:12:39,576 --> 00:12:41,376
I'm more curious about the pork cutlet style.

247
00:12:41,576 --> 00:12:43,976
You just follow the plaid pattern for the pork cutlet style.

248
00:12:46,287 --> 00:12:48,686
It really feels like a pork cutlet than a steak.

249
00:12:48,687 --> 00:12:49,757
Pork cutlet style.

250
00:12:50,387 --> 00:12:51,586
Here's your pork cutlet.

251
00:12:52,687 --> 00:12:54,585
It's sweet pork cutlet. Try it.

252
00:12:54,586 --> 00:12:55,996
I'll try.

253
00:12:56,326 --> 00:12:57,496
Thank you.

254
00:12:57,956 --> 00:12:59,595
A joke like "here's your pork cutlet..."

255
00:12:59,596 --> 00:13:02,027
can only be made in the early stage.

256
00:13:03,767 --> 00:13:05,767
If you say that after a year, she'll curse at you.

257
00:13:06,606 --> 00:13:07,836
"Pork cutlet?"

258
00:13:08,637 --> 00:13:10,006
"Here's your pork cutlet?"

259
00:13:10,007 --> 00:13:11,507
She'll say, "Shut it and eat."

260
00:13:12,106 --> 00:13:14,605
But it might be okay if there's just the two of them.

261
00:13:14,606 --> 00:13:16,575
They can do whatever when it's just the two of them.

262
00:13:16,576 --> 00:13:18,317
Those are good days.

263
00:13:18,846 --> 00:13:21,146
- That looks like a steak. - This is a steak.

264
00:13:21,147 --> 00:13:22,686
Maybe because of the shape.

265
00:13:22,687 --> 00:13:25,286
The colour is that of a well-done steak too.

266
00:13:25,287 --> 00:13:26,626
Here's your steak.

267
00:13:27,387 --> 00:13:28,787
- I'll try it. - Okay.

268
00:13:33,027 --> 00:13:34,167
It's very delicious.

269
00:13:34,427 --> 00:13:36,536
Is chocolate your favourite flavour?

270
00:13:36,537 --> 00:13:38,536
For desserts,

271
00:13:38,537 --> 00:13:40,366
I like yoghurt and chocolate.

272
00:13:40,667 --> 00:13:42,037
- Yoghurt and chocolate? - Yes.

273
00:13:42,206 --> 00:13:44,235
Which ice cream flavours do you like?

274
00:13:44,236 --> 00:13:46,006
Always plain or vanilla.

275
00:13:46,007 --> 00:13:48,647
I like mint chocolate.

276
00:13:50,576 --> 00:13:52,146
Why? What's that look supposed to mean?

277
00:13:52,147 --> 00:13:54,547
- Are you pro-mint chocolate? - Are you anti-mint chocolate?

278
00:13:55,116 --> 00:13:56,387
Let us join forces.

279
00:13:59,187 --> 00:14:00,986
I met my comrade here.

280
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:04,825
You looked like you were anti-mint chocolate just now.

281
00:14:04,826 --> 00:14:06,066
Did I look like one?

282
00:14:06,067 --> 00:14:07,566
No, that was my look of determination.

283
00:14:07,567 --> 00:14:08,625
Really?

284
00:14:08,626 --> 00:14:10,966
Yes. I suddenly got a sense of chivalry.

285
00:14:12,137 --> 00:14:13,307
We're on the same team.

286
00:14:14,137 --> 00:14:15,566
You know that ice cream shop?

287
00:14:15,567 --> 00:14:17,776
Which flavours do you choose when you go there?

288
00:14:17,777 --> 00:14:19,606
Mint chocolate, pistachio,

289
00:14:20,576 --> 00:14:21,576
and green tea.

290
00:14:21,577 --> 00:14:24,115
- They're all green. - You're right, they're all green.

291
00:14:24,116 --> 00:14:25,417
I like green flavours too.

292
00:14:25,547 --> 00:14:27,386
I eat green tea very often.

293
00:14:27,387 --> 00:14:29,115
I sometimes eat just green tea.

294
00:14:29,116 --> 00:14:31,386
I feel that we're similar but different again.

295
00:14:31,387 --> 00:14:32,826
We're different but similar.

296
00:14:33,887 --> 00:14:35,355
- That's the best. - Yes.

297
00:14:35,356 --> 00:14:38,225
- Similar yet different. - That's right.

298
00:14:38,226 --> 00:14:41,027
- Being too similar isn't good. - It's rather bad.

299
00:14:41,667 --> 00:14:42,797
Do you like animals?

300
00:14:43,096 --> 00:14:46,365
I have a character that I love,

301
00:14:46,366 --> 00:14:48,006
and he is a dog.

302
00:14:48,007 --> 00:14:49,735
- It's Snoopy. - Snoopy.

303
00:14:49,736 --> 00:14:52,975
I took care of my friend's cat with my friend for a while.

304
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:54,205
I find cats really cute too.

305
00:14:54,206 --> 00:14:55,776
You suit cats a little more.

306
00:14:55,777 --> 00:14:58,615
- Cats? - You have a black cat vibe.

307
00:14:58,616 --> 00:14:59,946
- A black cat vibe? - Yes.

308
00:15:00,486 --> 00:15:01,616
A bit.

309
00:15:01,986 --> 00:15:03,016
Now, you're very...

310
00:15:03,017 --> 00:15:04,855
A black cat vibe? Do I suit cats more?

311
00:15:04,856 --> 00:15:06,485
You suit cats very well today.

312
00:15:06,486 --> 00:15:07,886
You're not going to run out on all fours, are you?

313
00:15:07,887 --> 00:15:09,027
What a joke.

314
00:15:10,257 --> 00:15:12,526
Then Snoopy... But doesn't Snoopy walk on two legs?

315
00:15:12,527 --> 00:15:13,596
Snoopy walks.

316
00:15:14,696 --> 00:15:16,466
Snoopy walks and sings.

317
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,365
I'll walk on all four,

318
00:15:19,366 --> 00:15:20,636
so you should sing.

319
00:15:20,637 --> 00:15:23,205
Snoopy always has someone by his side when he sings.

320
00:15:23,206 --> 00:15:24,235
He's Woodstock.

321
00:15:24,236 --> 00:15:26,075
- He only sings with Woodstock. - He needs him by his side.

322
00:15:26,076 --> 00:15:28,046
- Not on his own? - Not on his own.

323
00:15:28,047 --> 00:15:30,446
Then flap your ears like Snoopy when we walk out.

324
00:15:34,287 --> 00:15:36,186
As we talked, I thought...

325
00:15:36,187 --> 00:15:37,657
that we talked the same language.

326
00:15:37,956 --> 00:15:39,057
"It's quite fun."

327
00:15:39,187 --> 00:15:41,486
"She has a sense of humour."

328
00:15:41,757 --> 00:15:44,027
"And our senses of humour seem to match."

329
00:15:44,126 --> 00:15:46,695
I can't wait to find out Yong Woo's feelings...

330
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:47,796
- after this date. - I'm curious.

331
00:15:47,797 --> 00:15:49,797
- Exactly. - Things look very good right now.

332
00:15:50,037 --> 00:15:52,835
Last time, the conversation was very different.

333
00:15:52,836 --> 00:15:55,036
- It's a bit different from Cho A. - That's right.

334
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,306
- They didn't have much time either. - It's totally different.

335
00:15:56,307 --> 00:15:57,976
It's very different from Cho A.

336
00:15:58,706 --> 00:15:59,706
Totally different.

337
00:15:59,976 --> 00:16:02,046
Shall we go on a walk? Are you busy?

338
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,147
That sounds good.

339
00:16:03,547 --> 00:16:04,616
This is fun.

340
00:16:05,677 --> 00:16:07,887
Are we going to Montmartre Park?

341
00:16:08,287 --> 00:16:09,517
Let's go.

342
00:16:09,956 --> 00:16:11,116
Let's go.

343
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:16,856
Is this our first outing in the neighbourhood?

344
00:16:17,126 --> 00:16:20,826
Exactly. It's been so long since I had a neighbourhood outing.

345
00:16:21,027 --> 00:16:22,637
Shall we walk slowly?

346
00:16:23,866 --> 00:16:26,066
Isn't it tiring? I walk very fast.

347
00:16:26,067 --> 00:16:27,407
Really? I walk fast too.

348
00:16:27,866 --> 00:16:29,007
Tell me if you feel tired.

349
00:16:29,137 --> 00:16:30,536
I walk very fast.

350
00:16:30,537 --> 00:16:31,706
- Really? - Yes.

351
00:16:32,177 --> 00:16:34,846
Do we go straight to go to Montmartre Park?

352
00:16:35,307 --> 00:16:37,016
- Maybe. - Maybe?

353
00:16:37,017 --> 00:16:38,676
- Maybe. - You speak English well.

354
00:16:38,677 --> 00:16:39,716
Thank you.

355
00:16:40,716 --> 00:16:44,115
Have you been to Montmartre street in Paris?

356
00:16:44,116 --> 00:16:47,126
- Montmartre Park? - Yes, I've been there.

357
00:16:47,226 --> 00:16:49,225
Compare that place with here.

358
00:16:49,226 --> 00:16:50,257
Why is this place...

359
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:51,656
(Panting)

360
00:16:51,657 --> 00:16:53,826
- called Montmartre Park? - Are you okay?

361
00:16:55,797 --> 00:16:56,936
Breathe.

362
00:16:58,967 --> 00:17:00,537
It's so pretty here.

363
00:17:03,576 --> 00:17:05,236
Stand here. It's so pretty.

364
00:17:05,237 --> 00:17:06,447
This view.

365
00:17:06,707 --> 00:17:08,277
Shouldn't I take pictures of you?

366
00:17:09,576 --> 00:17:11,047
Are you a model by any chance?

367
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:12,517
Me?

368
00:17:12,846 --> 00:17:13,846
You look like you're playing around even now.

369
00:17:13,847 --> 00:17:15,856
The view is amazing.

370
00:17:16,856 --> 00:17:18,287
I'll take a picture for you too.

371
00:17:19,787 --> 00:17:21,527
Does this have a screenshot function?

372
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,027
It's so pretty.

373
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,396
It's really pretty.

374
00:17:29,067 --> 00:17:30,267
It's really pretty.

375
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:34,365
It's really warm here.

376
00:17:34,366 --> 00:17:36,406
- You're right. - The sunlight is so warm.

377
00:17:38,037 --> 00:17:39,606
- What is this? - Hold on.

378
00:17:39,807 --> 00:17:41,776
- That was so natural. - They...

379
00:17:41,777 --> 00:17:44,145
What happens if you do that...

380
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,175
when the relationship isn't developed?

381
00:17:45,176 --> 00:17:46,786
He definitely has feelings for her.

382
00:17:46,787 --> 00:17:48,786
Unless he secretly stuck chewing gum,

383
00:17:48,787 --> 00:17:50,057
he has feelings for her.

384
00:17:50,656 --> 00:17:52,185
Why does that mean that he has feelings for her?

385
00:17:52,186 --> 00:17:53,825
It feels like...

386
00:17:53,826 --> 00:17:56,757
you're leading someone instead of touching someone.

387
00:17:56,856 --> 00:17:58,497
Look at the direction.

388
00:17:59,727 --> 00:18:01,847
- But it can't be forceful. - If it's too forceful...

389
00:18:02,027 --> 00:18:03,267
That's taking her into custody.

390
00:18:03,497 --> 00:18:05,136
There's a Supreme Court near there.

391
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:08,435
It's really warm here.

392
00:18:08,436 --> 00:18:10,436
- You're right. - The sunlight is so warm.

393
00:18:12,777 --> 00:18:14,846
- I'll film the view. - Let me photosynthesise.

394
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:17,317
Let's show them the view.

395
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:20,047
The view.

396
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:23,217
Look here. Isn't the sky so pretty?

397
00:18:23,886 --> 00:18:25,057
It's so blue.

398
00:18:30,027 --> 00:18:32,747
This is the Silkworm Bridge. Is it because it looks like a silkworm?

399
00:18:33,366 --> 00:18:34,425
(Silkworm Bridge)

400
00:18:34,426 --> 00:18:35,426
"Silkworm Bridge."

401
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:37,536
Is it not?

402
00:18:37,537 --> 00:18:39,617
- It looks like a silkworm. - It does look like one.

403
00:18:40,106 --> 00:18:43,036
- This part looks like a maggot. - That's right.

404
00:18:43,037 --> 00:18:44,507
We became silkworms now.

405
00:18:45,576 --> 00:18:47,946
When you're in Seoul,

406
00:18:47,947 --> 00:18:49,467
do you occasionally go to high places?

407
00:18:49,876 --> 00:18:50,977
Yes.

408
00:18:51,717 --> 00:18:53,585
Sometimes, when I have a lot of things in mind,

409
00:18:53,586 --> 00:18:55,186
I like to go on an overpass.

410
00:18:55,386 --> 00:18:56,416
It's worth trying.

411
00:18:57,086 --> 00:18:59,826
People don't use the overpass as often as you think.

412
00:18:59,987 --> 00:19:01,826
- I see. - I go up there and... Gosh.

413
00:19:06,866 --> 00:19:08,326
It feels like I am on a trip.

414
00:19:10,697 --> 00:19:13,737
It would be nice to take a walk...

415
00:19:13,936 --> 00:19:16,277
- and go into a warm café... - That sounds great.

416
00:19:16,707 --> 00:19:18,105
And have tea.

417
00:19:18,106 --> 00:19:20,947
That sounds great. Let's go.

418
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:26,017
(A café in front of the House)

419
00:19:27,217 --> 00:19:28,987
I think everyone's really fun.

420
00:19:29,086 --> 00:19:30,257
And...

421
00:19:30,487 --> 00:19:32,925
it's a lot more meaningful because we're here...

422
00:19:32,926 --> 00:19:34,256
- with our families. - That's right.

423
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:35,287
It's meaningful.

424
00:19:35,727 --> 00:19:37,895
The thought of having my family...

425
00:19:37,896 --> 00:19:39,425
made me feel like...

426
00:19:39,426 --> 00:19:41,326
- That's right. - I was really going back home.

427
00:19:42,267 --> 00:19:45,166
When I first moved in, what surprised me a lot was...

428
00:19:45,697 --> 00:19:47,037
when you got the phone call.

429
00:19:48,207 --> 00:19:51,406
(On the first day of moving in, Se Seung and her dad on the phone)

430
00:19:52,237 --> 00:19:54,807
(They seem to be very close.)

431
00:19:55,346 --> 00:19:56,416
Right?

432
00:19:56,646 --> 00:19:58,747
At that time, you...

433
00:19:59,076 --> 00:20:00,386
- My dad? - Yes.

434
00:20:00,586 --> 00:20:03,615
I had a strong feeling...

435
00:20:03,616 --> 00:20:05,457
that you were a very bright person.

436
00:20:05,817 --> 00:20:07,855
And I was right.

437
00:20:07,856 --> 00:20:09,496
I still think you're very bright...

438
00:20:09,497 --> 00:20:10,757
and getting brighter.

439
00:20:11,797 --> 00:20:13,697
From that one phone call,

440
00:20:14,497 --> 00:20:16,095
I think I saw a lot of her charms.

441
00:20:16,096 --> 00:20:18,796
After spending time with Se Seung,

442
00:20:18,797 --> 00:20:22,405
I felt that she was brought up in a bright family.

443
00:20:22,406 --> 00:20:25,335
A happy family. She would've started from there.

444
00:20:25,336 --> 00:20:26,645
She has that energy...

445
00:20:26,646 --> 00:20:29,447
because she received love in a warm family.

446
00:20:29,717 --> 00:20:31,075
I liked those aspects of her.

447
00:20:31,076 --> 00:20:34,185
Right, when my dad called that time...

448
00:20:34,186 --> 00:20:35,786
(Don't focus on their looks too much.)

449
00:20:35,787 --> 00:20:37,185
(I would like you to date someone...)

450
00:20:37,186 --> 00:20:39,926
(who likes to work out like me.)

451
00:20:40,287 --> 00:20:42,956
(I hope you find a guy like me.)

452
00:20:42,957 --> 00:20:44,726
(I'll think about it.)

453
00:20:44,727 --> 00:20:47,267
He told me to find someone like him.

454
00:20:47,527 --> 00:20:49,767
Funnily enough, in the Siblings' Room...

455
00:20:50,297 --> 00:20:52,435
Cheol Hyeon.

456
00:20:52,436 --> 00:20:53,737
(They both burst out laughing.)

457
00:20:54,207 --> 00:20:56,135
- Isn't he a bit like Dad? - He's like Dad.

458
00:20:56,136 --> 00:20:58,906
- He's like Dad, right? - Yes. He's handsome, but...

459
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,375
Dad told me to date someone like him.

460
00:21:01,376 --> 00:21:02,916
Isn't that Cheol Hyeon then?

461
00:21:04,616 --> 00:21:07,217
Someone gave me a book as a present.

462
00:21:07,386 --> 00:21:08,585
Really?

463
00:21:08,586 --> 00:21:11,916
I was really touched. He's a bit like Dad.

464
00:21:11,987 --> 00:21:13,686
(Laughing)

465
00:21:13,957 --> 00:21:15,586
There's another Park Kyung Tae?

466
00:21:16,557 --> 00:21:18,956
- When I'm with him, - Yes.

467
00:21:18,957 --> 00:21:21,497
- he can be sweet like Dad. - Is he a gentle type?

468
00:21:21,896 --> 00:21:23,697
Yes. He's sweet too.

469
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:25,665
I can tell he's thoughtful too.

470
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:28,237
On top of that, he loves reading books.

471
00:21:28,366 --> 00:21:29,366
- Is that so? - Yes.

472
00:21:29,676 --> 00:21:31,476
He might have a lot to talk about with your dad...

473
00:21:31,477 --> 00:21:33,923
- The two of them will hit it off. - if he were to meet your dad...

474
00:21:33,947 --> 00:21:35,176
later in the future.

475
00:21:36,646 --> 00:21:37,817
Could it be Cheol Hyeon then?

476
00:21:39,717 --> 00:21:40,986
(Gosh. This is nice.)

477
00:21:40,987 --> 00:21:42,546
- This is nice. - She might not...

478
00:21:42,547 --> 00:21:44,517
end up with the guy we had in mind.

479
00:21:44,616 --> 00:21:46,056
She said he was similar to her dad.

480
00:21:46,057 --> 00:21:48,786
- Isn't that a meaningful phrase? - Right.

481
00:21:48,787 --> 00:21:49,896
- Totally. - Yes.

482
00:21:51,457 --> 00:21:53,227
(Ji Won and Yong Woo on the Benefit Date)

483
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:54,997
Are your eyes dry?

484
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:56,436
That's not it. I tend...

485
00:21:57,197 --> 00:21:58,436
to cry easily.

486
00:22:01,936 --> 00:22:03,307
That was funny.

487
00:22:03,477 --> 00:22:06,277
With whom do you feel the most comfortable among women?

488
00:22:06,606 --> 00:22:08,446
She had to keep working.

489
00:22:08,447 --> 00:22:11,477
I spent the least amount of time with Cho A.

490
00:22:11,616 --> 00:22:13,017
Relatively speaking,

491
00:22:13,747 --> 00:22:15,286
Ju Yeon also works.

492
00:22:15,287 --> 00:22:19,386
But she sort of leaves for work and comes back home early.

493
00:22:19,656 --> 00:22:22,425
I was able to spend time with her during dinner.

494
00:22:22,426 --> 00:22:24,696
(Were there obvious siblings you could easily figure out?)

495
00:22:24,697 --> 00:22:26,326
Yong Woo and Ju Yeon.

496
00:22:26,997 --> 00:22:28,396
They resemble each other so much.

497
00:22:29,126 --> 00:22:30,595
Ju Yeon is good at taking care of other people.

498
00:22:30,596 --> 00:22:31,596
I can sense that too.

499
00:22:31,597 --> 00:22:33,967
Right. She's always...

500
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:35,536
How should I put it?

501
00:22:35,537 --> 00:22:37,236
It could be a hassle, but she doesn't say no.

502
00:22:37,237 --> 00:22:38,336
She always helps out.

503
00:22:39,176 --> 00:22:41,977
I could easily see her that she was trying.

504
00:22:42,747 --> 00:22:44,277
You know what I mean?

505
00:22:44,646 --> 00:22:45,646
That made her laugh.

506
00:22:45,846 --> 00:22:47,362
- She had figured out everything. - She couldn't hold it back.

507
00:22:47,386 --> 00:22:49,286
He must have thought in his head that he had fooled her...

508
00:22:49,287 --> 00:22:50,716
- when he said that. - Right.

509
00:22:50,717 --> 00:22:51,855
- That's so funny. - Gosh.

510
00:22:51,856 --> 00:22:53,536
Don't say a thing. You guys look so alike.

511
00:22:53,656 --> 00:22:55,156
Don't do anything, Yong Woo.

512
00:22:55,926 --> 00:22:57,646
So I've grown attached to her in my head...

513
00:22:58,457 --> 00:23:00,466
although we had just met.

514
00:23:00,467 --> 00:23:02,466
(He had known Ju Yeon for decades.)

515
00:23:02,467 --> 00:23:04,497
Doesn't Ju Yeon sort of look like a white quokka?

516
00:23:06,096 --> 00:23:08,237
- She has beady eyes. - Yes.

517
00:23:08,507 --> 00:23:09,507
Right.

518
00:23:10,277 --> 00:23:11,506
- I'll start driving now. - Okay.

519
00:23:11,507 --> 00:23:14,227
(They set out to ride the cable car after complimenting his sister.)

520
00:23:15,047 --> 00:23:17,116
- It's the ocean. - It's the ocean.

521
00:23:17,376 --> 00:23:19,346
You like the oceans. And look where we are.

522
00:23:19,947 --> 00:23:21,216
I haven't been to an ocean in a while.

523
00:23:21,217 --> 00:23:22,377
It's been a while for me too.

524
00:23:23,856 --> 00:23:25,516
The view with the clouds look so beautiful.

525
00:23:25,517 --> 00:23:27,227
Exactly. My gosh.

526
00:23:32,826 --> 00:23:36,267
(The marine cable car stretches over to Jebu Island.)

527
00:23:42,166 --> 00:23:44,576
(Ji Won and Yong Woo on the marine cable car)

528
00:23:44,807 --> 00:23:46,036
Actually, I've never taken...

529
00:23:46,037 --> 00:23:47,352
- a cable car like this. - A cable car?

530
00:23:47,376 --> 00:23:49,506
Same here. I've taken a cable car to the mountain.

531
00:23:49,507 --> 00:23:51,547
But I've never taken one over the ocean.

532
00:23:52,146 --> 00:23:53,426
- Do you want to get in? - Sure.

533
00:24:02,257 --> 00:24:03,957
Is it like an amusement ride?

534
00:24:05,396 --> 00:24:06,997
- It's beautiful. - Right.

535
00:24:07,797 --> 00:24:09,865
Here we go. Are you ready?

536
00:24:09,866 --> 00:24:10,866
Yes.

537
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:16,605
Are you all right?

538
00:24:16,606 --> 00:24:18,237
I'm all right. This is fun.

539
00:24:19,676 --> 00:24:20,676
This is amazing.

540
00:24:21,146 --> 00:24:22,146
This is crazy.

541
00:24:24,447 --> 00:24:25,447
This is nice.

542
00:24:25,817 --> 00:24:27,577
The view looks much cooler in the cable car.

543
00:24:30,656 --> 00:24:31,787
I love this ride.

544
00:24:33,386 --> 00:24:35,257
- This place is stunning. - Yes.

545
00:24:35,487 --> 00:24:36,757
It was so beautiful.

546
00:24:37,497 --> 00:24:39,496
At that moment, I was grateful that...

547
00:24:39,497 --> 00:24:41,666
she chose to come to Jebu Island with me.

548
00:24:42,027 --> 00:24:44,595
We went there when the view was the coolest.

549
00:24:44,596 --> 00:24:47,365
The sun was starting to set. So the ocean looked more beautiful.

550
00:24:47,366 --> 00:24:49,306
The cable car ride...

551
00:24:49,307 --> 00:24:51,807
bringing us to the island from land was beautiful.

552
00:24:53,747 --> 00:24:55,176
I liked it.

553
00:24:55,477 --> 00:24:57,947
It felt like we travelled far on a trip.

554
00:24:58,217 --> 00:25:01,247
I was with a stranger, but it was comfortable at the same time.

555
00:25:01,547 --> 00:25:05,156
I think I only felt that way because I was with Yong Woo.

556
00:25:09,727 --> 00:25:12,033
She felt comfortable around a stranger? That's a done deal.

557
00:25:12,057 --> 00:25:14,227
Right. The environment was perfect.

558
00:25:14,396 --> 00:25:16,026
With that view,

559
00:25:16,027 --> 00:25:18,935
that's the perfect date for them to remember.

560
00:25:18,936 --> 00:25:20,267
- Right. - You know?

561
00:25:20,666 --> 00:25:21,737
Aren't you scared?

562
00:25:21,967 --> 00:25:24,606
- Gosh. Not at all. This is nothing. - Gosh. Oh, my.

563
00:25:24,777 --> 00:25:26,207
- I'm scared of the water. - Yes.

564
00:25:26,507 --> 00:25:28,387
I'm not scared as long as I don't fall into it.

565
00:25:28,807 --> 00:25:30,447
Can you swim in the ocean too?

566
00:25:30,977 --> 00:25:32,076
I've done it before.

567
00:25:32,477 --> 00:25:35,086
It's nice to come here after a long while.

568
00:25:35,487 --> 00:25:38,207
It's been a while since I last felt I was in the middle of an ocean.

569
00:25:38,656 --> 00:25:40,426
- The cloud is beautiful. - Yes.

570
00:25:41,257 --> 00:25:43,556
It was cool when the sun was up.

571
00:25:43,557 --> 00:25:45,033
- Right. - But it still looks cool...

572
00:25:45,057 --> 00:25:46,126
without the sun.

573
00:25:46,326 --> 00:25:48,396
A long time ago, I heard that...

574
00:25:48,727 --> 00:25:51,935
clouds were quite sharp...

575
00:25:51,936 --> 00:25:54,007
unlike the soft appearances they had.

576
00:25:54,307 --> 00:25:55,636
- I see. They're sharp? - Yes.

577
00:25:56,267 --> 00:25:58,875
I remember hearing that.

578
00:25:58,876 --> 00:26:00,906
Is that why airplanes shake a lot?

579
00:26:01,947 --> 00:26:04,346
They shake a lot when they go through clouds.

580
00:26:04,547 --> 00:26:05,547
Right.

581
00:26:05,646 --> 00:26:07,547
It's better to go around the clouds.

582
00:26:08,287 --> 00:26:10,956
As for those thin and small clouds over there...

583
00:26:10,957 --> 00:26:11,957
Yes.

584
00:26:11,958 --> 00:26:13,726
When you fly a training plane,

585
00:26:13,727 --> 00:26:15,527
it's fun to fly through them.

586
00:26:16,027 --> 00:26:18,596
The cloud over there. The small one.

587
00:26:18,957 --> 00:26:21,142
It feels great when you fly through small clouds like that one.

588
00:26:21,166 --> 00:26:22,767
- Like Sun Wukong. - Yes.

589
00:26:23,366 --> 00:26:25,636
When you look at these clouds hanging low,

590
00:26:25,797 --> 00:26:28,835
you can see that the layers are consistent.

591
00:26:28,836 --> 00:26:29,836
Yes.

592
00:26:29,837 --> 00:26:31,336
When you fly up,

593
00:26:31,777 --> 00:26:33,307
you'll be above the clouds.

594
00:26:33,606 --> 00:26:36,047
Clouds look pretty from that angle.

595
00:26:36,717 --> 00:26:38,477
I see.

596
00:26:39,346 --> 00:26:41,415
It wasn't that cold, right?

597
00:26:41,416 --> 00:26:43,586
- Yes. It was pretty nice. - Yes.

598
00:26:43,787 --> 00:26:46,656
- It was fun. - It was fun.

599
00:26:52,396 --> 00:26:54,426
(The two of them come into Jebu Island.)

600
00:26:54,666 --> 00:26:57,096
It's been so long since I last came to an ocean.

601
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:59,166
- Same here. The ocean... - Yes.

602
00:26:59,767 --> 00:27:03,036
I suddenly felt like I was on a trip just now.

603
00:27:03,037 --> 00:27:04,037
Right.

604
00:27:04,038 --> 00:27:06,376
A small part of me feels like we're on Jeju Island.

605
00:27:07,007 --> 00:27:08,206
Seriously.

606
00:27:08,207 --> 00:27:09,875
(Shooting range)

607
00:27:09,876 --> 00:27:11,556
The shooting range... Are you a good shot?

608
00:27:11,947 --> 00:27:13,116
- As in shooting guns? - Yes.

609
00:27:13,416 --> 00:27:14,717
I don't think I'm a bad shot.

610
00:27:15,186 --> 00:27:16,586
Would you like to try it?

611
00:27:17,686 --> 00:27:19,385
What if you can shoot as well as John Wick?

612
00:27:19,386 --> 00:27:21,146
What if you start shooting down the targets?

613
00:27:21,257 --> 00:27:24,395
You won't take out a gun with your name on it there, right?

614
00:27:24,396 --> 00:27:25,926
I might say, "Hold on a second."

615
00:27:26,027 --> 00:27:27,726
The owner might greet you, "You're here."

616
00:27:27,727 --> 00:27:29,625
Should we do it? Brace yourself when you get out.

617
00:27:29,626 --> 00:27:31,412
(The two of them decided to play at the shooting range.)

618
00:27:31,436 --> 00:27:32,496
- How about a practice round? - Hold on.

619
00:27:32,497 --> 00:27:34,066
- Do I have to put this here? - Yes.

620
00:27:34,067 --> 00:27:36,935
You have to place it closely against your shoulder.

621
00:27:36,936 --> 00:27:38,656
- I see. Like this? - Here's how you do it.

622
00:27:38,936 --> 00:27:41,277
- Close your left eye. - Put your elbows on the counter.

623
00:27:41,507 --> 00:27:43,747
- Put my elbows on the counter. - There you go.

624
00:27:44,176 --> 00:27:45,516
(It's a practice drill.)

625
00:27:45,517 --> 00:27:46,685
I see. Like this.

626
00:27:46,686 --> 00:27:49,047
- Okay. I'll reload. I got it. - You're good.

627
00:27:51,317 --> 00:27:53,386
You're good. You're like a sniper. Nice.

628
00:27:53,757 --> 00:27:55,756
- All right. - I'm ready to tease you now.

629
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:57,197
- Okay. - One to zero?

630
00:27:57,957 --> 00:27:59,126
Did we already start?

631
00:28:02,326 --> 00:28:04,496
- Nice. - Did you knock it over?

632
00:28:04,497 --> 00:28:05,857
- Yes. The Pikachu doll. - What...

633
00:28:06,297 --> 00:28:07,966
Didn't you say you worked in the entertainment industry?

634
00:28:07,967 --> 00:28:09,666
- What? - A professional hunter is here.

635
00:28:11,576 --> 00:28:12,576
(The real game begins.)

636
00:28:13,606 --> 00:28:14,646
- Okay. - You're good.

637
00:28:15,876 --> 00:28:17,916
You must be a professional hunter.

638
00:28:18,846 --> 00:28:21,017
I might be in trouble.

639
00:28:21,886 --> 00:28:23,615
I think he pointed his gun pretty close to the target.

640
00:28:23,616 --> 00:28:26,116
- He did this. - Oh, no.

641
00:28:26,186 --> 00:28:27,486
Didn't his gun touch the target?

642
00:28:27,487 --> 00:28:29,856
He might be able to knock it down with the muzzle.

643
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:33,165
He must be feeling impatient.

644
00:28:33,166 --> 00:28:34,406
- With the muzzle. - Like this.

645
00:28:35,227 --> 00:28:36,596
- He's poking. - He's poking.

646
00:28:39,297 --> 00:28:40,436
You're in big trouble now.

647
00:28:43,037 --> 00:28:44,397
I have no choice but to tease you.

648
00:28:44,836 --> 00:28:46,307
Ma'am, reveal your real job.

649
00:28:50,047 --> 00:28:52,047
Gosh. You're so good. What is this?

650
00:28:53,317 --> 00:28:54,886
No. You got the hang of it now.

651
00:28:56,616 --> 00:28:57,886
(He fails again.)

652
00:29:00,586 --> 00:29:01,586
Did it topple over?

653
00:29:01,826 --> 00:29:03,027
It's 1 to 1. Okay.

654
00:29:03,227 --> 00:29:04,596
(The hunter is up.)

655
00:29:06,426 --> 00:29:07,426
Okay.

656
00:29:09,467 --> 00:29:10,997
(Yong Woo fails again.)

657
00:29:11,567 --> 00:29:14,106
- I see a teasing smile on Doraemon. - Come on. Why?

658
00:29:14,666 --> 00:29:17,676
I think Doraemon ate my bullet just now.

659
00:29:18,737 --> 00:29:19,737
Okay.

660
00:29:21,146 --> 00:29:22,176
What?

661
00:29:23,447 --> 00:29:25,717
- Okay. - Gosh. You're so good.

662
00:29:25,916 --> 00:29:27,487
She was a really good shot.

663
00:29:27,817 --> 00:29:29,517
Ji Won set up a trap.

664
00:29:29,616 --> 00:29:31,176
When she asked me if I was a good shot,

665
00:29:31,416 --> 00:29:33,526
I remember saying I wasn't a bad shot.

666
00:29:33,527 --> 00:29:35,786
But I should have told her that I had never served...

667
00:29:35,787 --> 00:29:37,467
in the military and held a gun in my head.

668
00:29:37,856 --> 00:29:39,126
Mentally, I'm knocked out.

669
00:29:39,967 --> 00:29:44,067
Given the build he has and other physical features,

670
00:29:45,666 --> 00:29:49,307
his shooting skills made me think he was cute.

671
00:29:49,836 --> 00:29:51,453
- You caught a dolphin. - We caught a dolphin.

672
00:29:51,477 --> 00:29:52,575
Yes. A dolphin.

673
00:29:52,576 --> 00:29:54,136
- Thank you. This is cute. - Thank you.

674
00:29:54,477 --> 00:29:55,877
- This is really cute. - Thank you.

675
00:29:57,547 --> 00:30:00,345
(Anyway, the two of them caught the dolphins together.)

676
00:30:00,346 --> 00:30:01,915
It's just a doll. But it sure makes me feel good.

677
00:30:01,916 --> 00:30:03,757
Right. She gave us a dolphin.

678
00:30:03,987 --> 00:30:05,717
This one's name is Norae as in yellow.

679
00:30:05,886 --> 00:30:07,027
- Norae? - Yes.

680
00:30:07,086 --> 00:30:08,356
- That's the name? - Yes.

681
00:30:08,586 --> 00:30:10,957
- The last name is Saet. - As in super yellow.

682
00:30:11,626 --> 00:30:13,095
- Why won't you name this one? - I...

683
00:30:13,096 --> 00:30:14,865
- That one is Pink. - Just Pink?

684
00:30:14,866 --> 00:30:16,936
- The last name is Hot. - Hot Pink.

685
00:30:19,197 --> 00:30:20,306
- Hot Pink. - That was funny.

686
00:30:20,307 --> 00:30:21,307
Gosh.

687
00:30:21,308 --> 00:30:22,865
- Saet Norae and Hot Pink. - Gosh.

688
00:30:22,866 --> 00:30:24,135
- Gosh. - He's amazing.

689
00:30:24,136 --> 00:30:25,507
That was pretty good.

690
00:30:25,636 --> 00:30:27,777
That's Corn. The last name is Pop.

691
00:30:29,207 --> 00:30:31,016
- Seriously. What's wrong with him? - Didn't I do the same thing?

692
00:30:31,017 --> 00:30:32,047
Was it different?

693
00:30:33,747 --> 00:30:34,747
I'm sorry.

694
00:30:35,317 --> 00:30:37,686
(The house in Seorae Village)

695
00:30:43,997 --> 00:30:46,767
(She starts writing a note.)

696
00:30:47,467 --> 00:30:49,726
It snowed in the morning,

697
00:30:49,727 --> 00:30:51,127
so I wanted to express my feelings.

698
00:30:51,567 --> 00:30:54,006
"I wanted to see the snow falling with you."

699
00:30:54,007 --> 00:30:55,543
"It was a pity we couldn't see it together."

700
00:30:55,567 --> 00:30:58,307
"Let's enjoy the snow together next time."

701
00:30:58,477 --> 00:31:01,846
I drew a snowman and finished writing my message.

702
00:31:08,416 --> 00:31:10,257
I had to let him know I wrote it.

703
00:31:11,116 --> 00:31:13,825
I took a selfie with the instant camera.

704
00:31:13,826 --> 00:31:15,727
But my face was kind of concealed.

705
00:31:16,126 --> 00:31:17,446
I wanted him to guess who it was.

706
00:31:17,826 --> 00:31:18,895
(The snow in the morning was beautiful.)

707
00:31:18,896 --> 00:31:19,925
(It was a pity we couldn't see it together.)

708
00:31:19,926 --> 00:31:22,027
(Let's enjoy the snow together next time.)

709
00:31:25,936 --> 00:31:28,836
I was going to place the note and the picture in his room.

710
00:31:29,336 --> 00:31:30,676
But...

711
00:31:31,207 --> 00:31:34,406
expressing my feelings so openly like this today...

712
00:31:35,106 --> 00:31:36,106
I wondered...

713
00:31:36,977 --> 00:31:39,346
if I was rushing it. That crossed my mind.

714
00:31:39,747 --> 00:31:41,787
I decided to take a step back.

715
00:31:50,697 --> 00:31:53,126
(She put it back in her drawer.)

716
00:31:54,767 --> 00:31:55,797
She's holding back.

717
00:31:57,237 --> 00:31:58,736
- She's holding back. - Really?

718
00:31:58,737 --> 00:32:01,297
- She should have given it to him. - She should've expressed it.

719
00:32:01,507 --> 00:32:03,547
It would've felt her affection was bigger than his.

720
00:32:03,737 --> 00:32:05,707
- Or he could've felt uncomfortable. - So cute.

721
00:32:07,106 --> 00:32:09,547
(Jae Hyung comes back home from work.)

722
00:32:14,487 --> 00:32:17,156
(He spots a package.)

723
00:32:19,856 --> 00:32:20,886
A pile of packages...

724
00:32:21,886 --> 00:32:23,156
has arrived.

725
00:32:24,126 --> 00:32:26,497
(He takes all the packages and goes upstairs.)

726
00:32:28,967 --> 00:32:29,967
Se Seung.

727
00:32:29,968 --> 00:32:31,673
- Why do you have so many boxes? - We got packages.

728
00:32:31,697 --> 00:32:33,067
Is it just you in the house?

729
00:32:33,737 --> 00:32:35,017
Cheol Hyeon is in the house too.

730
00:32:35,467 --> 00:32:36,507
I'm hungry.

731
00:32:36,906 --> 00:32:38,537
- Did you not eat? - No.

732
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:40,822
- You need to use a knife. - How are you...

733
00:32:40,846 --> 00:32:41,947
We don't have one.

734
00:32:42,106 --> 00:32:43,547
How are you doing?

735
00:32:45,817 --> 00:32:46,987
I'm asking you a question.

736
00:32:47,287 --> 00:32:48,822
- You need to use a knife. - How are you...

737
00:32:48,846 --> 00:32:49,947
We don't have one.

738
00:32:50,116 --> 00:32:51,557
How are you doing?

739
00:32:53,826 --> 00:32:55,027
I'm asking you a question.

740
00:32:55,656 --> 00:32:56,856
What do you mean by that?

741
00:32:57,027 --> 00:32:59,126
I'm just asking if you're doing well these days.

742
00:32:59,396 --> 00:33:00,396
I see.

743
00:33:02,527 --> 00:33:04,396
- You're leaving again, right? - Yes.

744
00:33:04,697 --> 00:33:06,067
When are you leaving?

745
00:33:07,467 --> 00:33:09,467
- I don't know. - I don't know either.

746
00:33:10,606 --> 00:33:12,635
(Last night, )

747
00:33:12,636 --> 00:33:15,776
(the phones on the 1st floor and in the basement rang.)

748
00:33:15,777 --> 00:33:18,415
(The male participant...)

749
00:33:18,416 --> 00:33:20,185
(and the female participant...)

750
00:33:20,186 --> 00:33:21,946
(who answered the phones together...)

751
00:33:21,947 --> 00:33:26,855
(will be matched for the random date.)

752
00:33:26,856 --> 00:33:28,027
(Ju Yeon: Hello.)

753
00:33:28,227 --> 00:33:29,227
Hello.

754
00:33:29,228 --> 00:33:31,596
(Ju Yeon and Jae Hyung will go on the random date.)

755
00:33:31,727 --> 00:33:34,826
(Yong Woo and Cho A will go on the random date.)

756
00:33:34,997 --> 00:33:38,766
(Jung Sub and Se Seung will go on the random date.)

757
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:42,166
(Cheol Hyeon and Yun Ha will go on the random date.)

758
00:33:42,406 --> 00:33:43,977
This was completely random.

759
00:33:44,707 --> 00:33:45,787
How did we end up together?

760
00:33:46,406 --> 00:33:47,406
I was happy.

761
00:33:48,576 --> 00:33:50,446
This is so exciting. Seriously.

762
00:33:50,447 --> 00:33:51,693
(Their random dates will begin tonight.)

763
00:33:51,717 --> 00:33:53,517
Is it better not to wear any makeup?

764
00:33:54,017 --> 00:33:56,323
- Did you not wear any makeup? - I'm only wearing sunscreen.

765
00:33:56,347 --> 00:34:00,157
Your skin looks darker when you wear makeup.

766
00:34:00,887 --> 00:34:03,456
I can put on the concealer. Just a little bit?

767
00:34:03,927 --> 00:34:06,556
You should just dab it gently like this.

768
00:34:06,726 --> 00:34:07,827
Gosh. It's so hard.

769
00:34:09,027 --> 00:34:12,867
I think I applied it 3 or 4 more times than usual.

770
00:34:13,666 --> 00:34:14,867
That's enough.

771
00:34:15,336 --> 00:34:16,336
I see.

772
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:17,836
Here?

773
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:19,306
- Here? - Yes.

774
00:34:19,777 --> 00:34:21,145
- No. - It might not look that bad.

775
00:34:21,146 --> 00:34:22,347
Try it on.

776
00:34:27,347 --> 00:34:28,547
I'll go with this one.

777
00:34:29,686 --> 00:34:30,686
Okay.

778
00:34:32,016 --> 00:34:35,786
I wonder what's taking my date so long to come home.

779
00:34:36,286 --> 00:34:39,496
(The date she has been waiting for arrives home.)

780
00:34:41,226 --> 00:34:42,826
(He's carrying a big bag into his room.)

781
00:34:44,266 --> 00:34:45,296
What's this?

782
00:34:45,297 --> 00:34:46,867
- He won an award. - Really?

783
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:49,306
You won first place.

784
00:34:49,806 --> 00:34:50,806
That's incredible.

785
00:34:51,976 --> 00:34:53,236
Congratulations.

786
00:34:53,237 --> 00:34:54,276
(He's the pride of the group.)

787
00:34:54,277 --> 00:34:55,746
I can't believe you won first place.

788
00:34:56,447 --> 00:34:58,317
Let's go. You came home later than I thought.

789
00:34:59,146 --> 00:35:01,286
- We'll be back later. - Bye.

790
00:35:06,516 --> 00:35:08,827
When did you have a meal? I had lunch.

791
00:35:09,427 --> 00:35:10,547
This is my first meal today.

792
00:35:11,297 --> 00:35:13,026
- Oh, no. - This is crazy.

793
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:15,126
- Let's enjoy this meal. - Totally.

794
00:35:15,597 --> 00:35:17,766
I don't mind eating late.

795
00:35:18,137 --> 00:35:20,765
But we might not have enough time. I might be sad about that.

796
00:35:20,766 --> 00:35:23,606
Right. I'm really sorry that I came so late. I mean it.

797
00:35:24,306 --> 00:35:25,975
Okay. Let's go.

798
00:35:25,976 --> 00:35:27,077
Let's go.

799
00:35:27,407 --> 00:35:28,407
By the way,

800
00:35:29,306 --> 00:35:30,516
- it's... - Yes.

801
00:35:31,376 --> 00:35:32,746
What is it? Let me do it for you.

802
00:35:33,277 --> 00:35:35,286
- There was a reason why I was late. - Okay.

803
00:35:39,717 --> 00:35:40,786
Hold on.

804
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:47,427
(He grabs something from the back seat.)

805
00:35:49,266 --> 00:35:51,797
I was late because I bought this on my way home.

806
00:35:54,567 --> 00:35:56,867
Actually, that's not it. The real present is in the bag.

807
00:35:58,606 --> 00:35:59,875
Could I get some water?

808
00:35:59,876 --> 00:36:01,396
- Let me have a sip. - Sure. Go ahead.

809
00:36:01,447 --> 00:36:03,617
Gosh. You didn't have to get me anything.

810
00:36:03,817 --> 00:36:07,086
I chose the scent that would go well with you.

811
00:36:10,356 --> 00:36:12,015
We had the first snow of the year this morning.

812
00:36:12,016 --> 00:36:13,555
And we made a promise to each other.

813
00:36:13,556 --> 00:36:16,487
That we would express our feelings on the day of the first snow.

814
00:36:16,786 --> 00:36:18,996
So I went to work that day.

815
00:36:19,226 --> 00:36:21,896
Then I went to Sinsa to buy the hand cream for her.

816
00:36:23,126 --> 00:36:25,835
The velvety finish stands out with this hand cream.

817
00:36:25,836 --> 00:36:26,895
Velvety?

818
00:36:26,896 --> 00:36:30,035
After smelling the hand cream, I chose the scent...

819
00:36:30,036 --> 00:36:32,476
that would suit her the best and gave it to her as a present.

820
00:36:33,137 --> 00:36:35,617
- Both of them remembered it. - He remembered it when he left.

821
00:36:35,706 --> 00:36:37,145
She should have given him the letter.

822
00:36:37,146 --> 00:36:38,616
Did he do well with the presentation?

823
00:36:38,617 --> 00:36:39,745
He was preoccupied with the present.

824
00:36:39,746 --> 00:36:41,693
He had prepared the presentation gradually over time.

825
00:36:41,717 --> 00:36:42,745
Seriously.

826
00:36:42,746 --> 00:36:44,156
If I were him, I would've bombed the presentation.

827
00:36:44,157 --> 00:36:45,186
Same here.

828
00:36:45,916 --> 00:36:47,657
Picking out a scent as a present is great.

829
00:36:47,786 --> 00:36:50,527
She'll think about him whenever she smells that.

830
00:36:50,697 --> 00:36:52,157
- Right. - Seriously.

831
00:36:54,166 --> 00:36:57,166
I was already excited to go on this date.

832
00:36:57,597 --> 00:37:00,367
Receiving this present on the way to our date...

833
00:37:01,007 --> 00:37:02,287
made my heart flutter even more.

834
00:37:03,836 --> 00:37:04,876
Thank you.

835
00:37:05,976 --> 00:37:08,206
- I want to open it later. - Sounds good.

836
00:37:11,476 --> 00:37:12,716
You must've been hungry.

837
00:37:12,717 --> 00:37:14,616
But you got a lot of things done. You had to go to many places.

838
00:37:14,617 --> 00:37:16,387
- Seriously. - This is so touching.

839
00:37:20,456 --> 00:37:21,555
- After answering... - Yes.

840
00:37:21,556 --> 00:37:22,657
The phone yesterday,

841
00:37:23,027 --> 00:37:24,157
what did you think?

842
00:37:24,827 --> 00:37:26,257
I thought, "How is this possible?"

843
00:37:26,697 --> 00:37:28,427
I felt at ease.

844
00:37:30,467 --> 00:37:34,407
There are a lot more things we have to consider in the house.

845
00:37:34,867 --> 00:37:36,137
Could you give me an example?

846
00:37:37,976 --> 00:37:41,347
I would like to talk to you without feeling any pressure.

847
00:37:42,646 --> 00:37:46,047
I see Cheol Hyeon watching us somewhere in the house.

848
00:37:46,376 --> 00:37:47,646
- Really? - He's watching us.

849
00:37:48,617 --> 00:37:50,185
He might not be watching us.

850
00:37:50,186 --> 00:37:51,955
He could simply have been there as always.

851
00:37:51,956 --> 00:37:52,987
That's possible.

852
00:37:53,456 --> 00:37:55,136
But at one point, I started to notice him.

853
00:37:56,157 --> 00:37:58,625
(Last night)

854
00:37:58,626 --> 00:38:00,466
(Jung Sub: Shall we have dinner tomorrow?)

855
00:38:00,467 --> 00:38:01,467
- Dinner? - Yes.

856
00:38:01,468 --> 00:38:03,996
(Cheol Hyeon came out of the bathroom at that moment.)

857
00:38:04,336 --> 00:38:06,137
(Glancing)

858
00:38:07,266 --> 00:38:08,706
(Jung Sub: Should we get some meat?)

859
00:38:08,737 --> 00:38:10,806
(Strolling around)

860
00:38:11,036 --> 00:38:12,036
Or...

861
00:38:12,936 --> 00:38:14,606
(Cheol Hyeon: Are you hungry?)

862
00:38:15,146 --> 00:38:17,117
(Glancing)

863
00:38:18,817 --> 00:38:20,276
- I see. - I started to notice him.

864
00:38:20,277 --> 00:38:21,917
- That's all. - I get what you're saying.

865
00:38:21,947 --> 00:38:24,667
I don't want to walk on eggshells around people when talking to you.

866
00:38:24,887 --> 00:38:26,656
- That's starting to bother him. - Gosh.

867
00:38:26,657 --> 00:38:27,986
- Hold on. - He's starting to notice that.

868
00:38:27,987 --> 00:38:29,625
- Is it okay to say he's bothered... - Gosh.

869
00:38:29,626 --> 00:38:31,757
- by Cheol Hyeon openly like that? - Right? Gosh.

870
00:38:32,056 --> 00:38:35,367
In a way, he could be expressing his feelings to her.

871
00:38:37,567 --> 00:38:38,666
What did you do today?

872
00:38:39,266 --> 00:38:40,297
- Today, - Yes.

873
00:38:42,067 --> 00:38:43,976
I walked around the neighbourhood.

874
00:38:44,277 --> 00:38:45,407
- Really? - Yes.

875
00:38:47,036 --> 00:38:48,376
Where did you go?

876
00:38:49,206 --> 00:38:50,376
- Montmartre Park? - Yes.

877
00:38:50,777 --> 00:38:52,076
There it is. He's asking questions now.

878
00:38:52,077 --> 00:38:53,916
- He saw her facial expression. - Oh, no.

879
00:38:54,516 --> 00:38:55,847
Where did you go?

880
00:38:56,686 --> 00:38:57,887
- Montmartre Park? - Yes.

881
00:38:58,487 --> 00:38:59,887
- Lucky you. - Have you been there?

882
00:38:59,916 --> 00:39:00,927
No.

883
00:39:02,487 --> 00:39:03,927
When we were in the car,

884
00:39:04,297 --> 00:39:05,496
he asked me what I did today.

885
00:39:05,726 --> 00:39:08,626
At that moment, I thought to myself, "How am I going to tell him?"

886
00:39:09,126 --> 00:39:10,866
"When did you leave today?"

887
00:39:10,867 --> 00:39:12,936
I deflected his question right away.

888
00:39:13,266 --> 00:39:14,606
When did you leave today?

889
00:39:14,766 --> 00:39:18,636
I left around 10:30am today.

890
00:39:18,637 --> 00:39:19,706
- Around 10:30am? - Yes.

891
00:39:19,876 --> 00:39:21,847
- With whom did you go? - With Cheol Hyeon.

892
00:39:23,007 --> 00:39:24,117
Just the two of you?

893
00:39:24,677 --> 00:39:25,677
(Screaming)

894
00:39:26,476 --> 00:39:27,717
- Oh, no. - Gosh.

895
00:39:27,887 --> 00:39:29,116
- She should've told him first. - This is...

896
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:31,316
She should have told him everything before he asked her.

897
00:39:31,317 --> 00:39:32,355
- Right. - Gosh. What?

898
00:39:32,356 --> 00:39:34,055
It looked like she was trying to hide it.

899
00:39:34,056 --> 00:39:35,125
It's okay.

900
00:39:35,126 --> 00:39:36,126
- Tell him... - Oh, no.

901
00:39:36,127 --> 00:39:38,273
The grass was dead, and there were spider webs on Silkworm Bridge.

902
00:39:38,297 --> 00:39:39,927
Just tell him it was freezing.

903
00:39:40,456 --> 00:39:42,496
- With whom did you go? - With Cheol Hyeon.

904
00:39:43,597 --> 00:39:44,766
Just the two of you?

905
00:39:46,297 --> 00:39:48,265
Oh, my. This is just...

906
00:39:48,266 --> 00:39:49,986
But it was only the two of us in the house.

907
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:51,206
- Really? - Yes.

908
00:39:51,376 --> 00:39:53,306
- No one else was home. - Right.

909
00:39:54,806 --> 00:39:57,317
In the end, he asked me with whom I had gone.

910
00:39:57,717 --> 00:40:00,346
I think his attention had already been on Cheol Hyeon before this.

911
00:40:00,347 --> 00:40:02,186
I think he was mistaken.

912
00:40:02,487 --> 00:40:04,887
It sounded like he was already bothered by Cheol Hyeon.

913
00:40:05,117 --> 00:40:06,756
But it must have sounded like...

914
00:40:06,757 --> 00:40:08,602
we went on a date by using the walk as an excuse.

915
00:40:08,626 --> 00:40:10,257
I felt really bad about that.

916
00:40:10,626 --> 00:40:12,396
But I didn't have to feel bad about it.

917
00:40:13,257 --> 00:40:14,626
I wondered why I felt bad.

918
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:17,027
How was it?

919
00:40:17,737 --> 00:40:18,737
It was cold.

920
00:40:18,896 --> 00:40:21,336
- It was really cold today. Right. - It was so cold.

921
00:40:22,206 --> 00:40:23,206
Was it pretty?

922
00:40:23,637 --> 00:40:25,277
It was pretty because the sky was pretty.

923
00:40:25,876 --> 00:40:26,936
The park was pretty.

924
00:40:27,407 --> 00:40:28,476
Se Seung...

925
00:40:29,106 --> 00:40:31,476
is very kind and sweet.

926
00:40:32,047 --> 00:40:35,916
I think she is a sweet person by nature.

927
00:40:36,286 --> 00:40:38,186
She tries to take care of others.

928
00:40:39,016 --> 00:40:41,527
So it didn't feel like...

929
00:40:41,657 --> 00:40:46,257
Se Seung was fully committed to me romantically.

930
00:40:46,996 --> 00:40:49,766
I didn't sense that.

931
00:40:50,737 --> 00:40:51,835
- That's a misunderstanding. - Gosh.

932
00:40:51,836 --> 00:40:53,266
- No. - That's...

933
00:40:53,766 --> 00:40:56,536
- That's a common concern... - No.

934
00:40:56,666 --> 00:40:58,875
For people who are innately sweet like us.

935
00:40:58,876 --> 00:41:00,836
- Everything... - Are you talking about yourself?

936
00:41:01,246 --> 00:41:02,246
Oh, no.

937
00:41:05,717 --> 00:41:07,416
BamBam. You're sweet to everyone.

938
00:41:08,547 --> 00:41:10,387
Hold on. She can't be mean to people.

939
00:41:10,516 --> 00:41:12,055
That's not the point.

940
00:41:12,056 --> 00:41:14,685
He wants her to treat him with more affection than others.

941
00:41:14,686 --> 00:41:17,026
- So the treatment would differ. - So she'd be sweet only to him.

942
00:41:17,027 --> 00:41:18,296
- Of course. - That must be it.

943
00:41:18,297 --> 00:41:19,326
That's a difficult thing to do.

944
00:41:19,327 --> 00:41:21,395
I noticed a slight change in his facial expression.

945
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:22,927
He got a huge misunderstanding.

946
00:41:23,226 --> 00:41:24,296
- It's important to be expressive. - Right.

947
00:41:24,297 --> 00:41:25,366
She should've given the letter.

948
00:41:25,367 --> 00:41:27,447
She should've given him the letter with the picture.

949
00:41:28,206 --> 00:41:30,976
By the way, what kind of man do you find attractive?

950
00:41:32,536 --> 00:41:35,406
I tend to rely on my significant other.

951
00:41:35,407 --> 00:41:36,407
Yes.

952
00:41:36,777 --> 00:41:39,317
I want him to have a big heart.

953
00:41:39,677 --> 00:41:41,437
Do you rely on your significant other a lot?

954
00:41:42,117 --> 00:41:43,117
Yes.

955
00:41:43,118 --> 00:41:44,786
You want someone with a big heart.

956
00:41:45,387 --> 00:41:47,927
- You want someone who's composed. - Yes. That's it.

957
00:41:48,027 --> 00:41:52,257
I tend to have mood swings from time to time.

958
00:41:52,757 --> 00:41:55,027
So I prefer my significant other...

959
00:41:55,427 --> 00:41:56,526
not to be moody.

960
00:41:56,527 --> 00:41:57,836
(Acknowledging it)

961
00:41:58,967 --> 00:42:01,043
If we turn this way, we'll reach Seoul National University.

962
00:42:01,067 --> 00:42:03,106
- Are we going to SNU? - I guess so.

963
00:42:04,036 --> 00:42:05,077
This is the place.

964
00:42:05,907 --> 00:42:10,146
(Se Seung and Jung Sub at a wine bar on Sharosu-Gil)

965
00:42:10,476 --> 00:42:12,346
Isn't this our first Friday after moving...

966
00:42:12,347 --> 00:42:13,645
into the house?

967
00:42:13,646 --> 00:42:14,646
You're right.

968
00:42:15,317 --> 00:42:17,332
- On a meaningful day like this, - It's already Friday?

969
00:42:17,356 --> 00:42:18,556
We ought to have a nice drink.

970
00:42:18,817 --> 00:42:21,126
We'll take a plate of lasagne...

971
00:42:21,356 --> 00:42:22,986
and the Gorgonzola pizza.

972
00:42:22,987 --> 00:42:24,507
- I'll get that ready for you. - Okay.

973
00:42:25,527 --> 00:42:26,827
- Can I open it? - Of course.

974
00:42:28,027 --> 00:42:29,626
- Wait. Is there a card? - That's...

975
00:42:31,867 --> 00:42:33,436
- This is so touching. - What?

976
00:42:34,967 --> 00:42:36,067
What a nice message.

977
00:42:38,106 --> 00:42:40,646
"I think this scent will suit you well."

978
00:42:40,907 --> 00:42:41,975
"Please wear it well."

979
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:43,146
(From Jung Sub)

980
00:42:44,416 --> 00:42:45,416
Thanks.

981
00:42:46,016 --> 00:42:47,016
Use as much as you want.

982
00:42:50,516 --> 00:42:53,157
- Oh, my. - Thank you.

983
00:43:07,197 --> 00:43:08,605
Did you take a look at this place?

984
00:43:08,606 --> 00:43:10,935
Did you look around? You were out of it, right?

985
00:43:10,936 --> 00:43:11,976
Take a look.

986
00:43:13,677 --> 00:43:14,706
That's interesting.

987
00:43:14,907 --> 00:43:17,206
- The wine bottles? - Yes. How they put them.

988
00:43:17,947 --> 00:43:19,347
I'm familiar with this place.

989
00:43:19,476 --> 00:43:21,245
I knew it.

990
00:43:21,246 --> 00:43:24,386
I had a feeling.

991
00:43:24,387 --> 00:43:25,986
I was like, "Enjoy."

992
00:43:25,987 --> 00:43:27,725
- "Did you take a look?" - "Look around."

993
00:43:27,726 --> 00:43:28,757
"Did you take a look?"

994
00:43:29,126 --> 00:43:32,125
I can definitely tell that you come here often.

995
00:43:32,126 --> 00:43:33,872
You used to come to Sharosu-Gil often, right?

996
00:43:33,896 --> 00:43:36,396
- Yes. I like Sharosu-Gil. - Where else have you been to?

997
00:43:36,626 --> 00:43:39,196
I live nearby,

998
00:43:39,197 --> 00:43:41,507
so I was so itching to tell him.

999
00:43:41,766 --> 00:43:45,535
We went to a bar that I frequented.

1000
00:43:45,536 --> 00:43:48,206
"How can Jung Sub's school..."

1001
00:43:48,646 --> 00:43:50,606
"be near my place?"

1002
00:43:51,376 --> 00:43:53,246
That's what I thought alone.

1003
00:43:55,387 --> 00:43:57,717
Did Cheol Hyeon ask you to come with him first?

1004
00:43:58,516 --> 00:44:00,185
- Gosh. - Stop asking that.

1005
00:44:00,186 --> 00:44:02,585
- If you do, you'll look petty. - What? It's fun.

1006
00:44:02,586 --> 00:44:04,296
- One more time. - It's more fun this way.

1007
00:44:04,297 --> 00:44:05,297
They should clear this up.

1008
00:44:05,298 --> 00:44:07,326
- Why can't he ask? - I hope he just uses this time...

1009
00:44:07,327 --> 00:44:09,866
to focus on themselves.

1010
00:44:09,867 --> 00:44:12,867
If the guy I was into got like that,

1011
00:44:13,166 --> 00:44:15,435
- I would find it adorable. - I'd rather like that.

1012
00:44:15,436 --> 00:44:16,935
- I would think he's into me too. - Really?

1013
00:44:16,936 --> 00:44:18,035
Honestly,

1014
00:44:18,036 --> 00:44:20,375
the most ideal scenario for me...

1015
00:44:20,376 --> 00:44:22,736
is for them to naturally talk about things that happened...

1016
00:44:23,106 --> 00:44:24,946
and for him to smoothly make her talk about the incident.

1017
00:44:24,947 --> 00:44:26,475
- That'd be the right way. - Right.

1018
00:44:26,476 --> 00:44:27,685
But now he sounds like,

1019
00:44:27,686 --> 00:44:29,346
"So what happened? Tell me what happened?"

1020
00:44:29,347 --> 00:44:30,986
It sounds a little intense.

1021
00:44:30,987 --> 00:44:32,216
Se Seung might feel like,

1022
00:44:32,217 --> 00:44:33,616
"Did I do something wrong?"

1023
00:44:33,617 --> 00:44:36,285
- "Why is he so obsessed?" - He's making her feel bad...

1024
00:44:36,286 --> 00:44:37,386
for something she doesn't have to.

1025
00:44:37,387 --> 00:44:38,395
"Why do I feel sorry?"

1026
00:44:38,396 --> 00:44:40,426
- She might think so. - She can't answer confidently.

1027
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:42,596
No. They're in the process of just finding out...

1028
00:44:42,597 --> 00:44:45,697
- who they're into. - I want a different process.

1029
00:44:48,367 --> 00:44:50,706
Did Cheol Hyeon ask you to come with him first?

1030
00:44:51,237 --> 00:44:52,306
Well...

1031
00:44:53,536 --> 00:44:54,676
No.

1032
00:44:54,677 --> 00:44:57,007
- He didn't, right? - I don't remember.

1033
00:44:57,347 --> 00:44:59,047
I'm trying to remember.

1034
00:44:59,876 --> 00:45:02,617
We were having a meal,

1035
00:45:03,217 --> 00:45:05,186
and he said, "We're alone at home today,"

1036
00:45:05,456 --> 00:45:07,456
"so I want to look around outside."

1037
00:45:08,286 --> 00:45:09,987
That's why...

1038
00:45:10,856 --> 00:45:11,956
we went out together.

1039
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:22,866
He seemed a little hesitant.

1040
00:45:22,867 --> 00:45:25,677
I would have felt bad if he'd been my boyfriend,

1041
00:45:25,836 --> 00:45:27,745
but he wasn't.

1042
00:45:27,746 --> 00:45:30,475
It wasn't like my heart fluttered...

1043
00:45:30,476 --> 00:45:33,276
when taking a walk with him either.

1044
00:45:33,277 --> 00:45:35,216
I didn't want to explain like,

1045
00:45:35,217 --> 00:45:36,685
"My heart didn't pound when I was with him."

1046
00:45:36,686 --> 00:45:39,456
I thought it'd be funny if I tried to make an excuse.

1047
00:45:39,686 --> 00:45:40,686
So...

1048
00:45:41,786 --> 00:45:44,027
I had mixed feelings.

1049
00:45:46,226 --> 00:45:49,327
This is a strange place.

1050
00:45:51,597 --> 00:45:52,896
Can I ask you this?

1051
00:45:53,036 --> 00:45:55,006
About your mood swings?

1052
00:45:55,007 --> 00:45:56,007
Yes.

1053
00:45:56,266 --> 00:45:58,146
You didn't have mood swings after you moved in?

1054
00:45:58,407 --> 00:46:01,105
There wasn't really a time my mood changed a lot.

1055
00:46:01,106 --> 00:46:03,047
It's been good so far.

1056
00:46:03,206 --> 00:46:05,177
Actually, yesterday...

1057
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:09,317
I felt something similar.

1058
00:46:09,487 --> 00:46:11,915
I thought, "I might experience some mood swings from now on."

1059
00:46:11,916 --> 00:46:13,055
It was like that.

1060
00:46:13,056 --> 00:46:14,386
"What if I have mood shifts?"

1061
00:46:14,387 --> 00:46:15,886
- Right. - "If I did,"

1062
00:46:15,887 --> 00:46:18,157
"I would suffer a lot."

1063
00:46:18,527 --> 00:46:20,356
That got me thinking a lot.

1064
00:46:20,527 --> 00:46:24,567
(The new participant made Se Seung's heart complicated.)

1065
00:46:24,797 --> 00:46:25,867
Me too.

1066
00:46:27,666 --> 00:46:29,106
Things will get complicated.

1067
00:46:30,706 --> 00:46:33,205
- Seriously. - I'm not saying I was sad.

1068
00:46:33,206 --> 00:46:35,406
I just thought things would get complicated.

1069
00:46:35,407 --> 00:46:37,277
It would get so confusing.

1070
00:46:40,347 --> 00:46:42,546
So have you decided...

1071
00:46:42,547 --> 00:46:45,216
on what to do...

1072
00:46:45,217 --> 00:46:47,386
if things get complicated?

1073
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:48,756
Or...

1074
00:46:48,757 --> 00:46:51,396
I thought I would handle it...

1075
00:46:52,027 --> 00:46:54,297
like you did at Montmartre Park.

1076
00:46:57,527 --> 00:46:59,296
I just thought that could happen.

1077
00:46:59,297 --> 00:47:01,867
I only thought about it that much.

1078
00:47:02,706 --> 00:47:04,137
(Smiling)

1079
00:47:07,847 --> 00:47:10,246
I'm so sorry.

1080
00:47:10,407 --> 00:47:11,476
Gosh.

1081
00:47:11,646 --> 00:47:13,717
I was kidding.

1082
00:47:14,447 --> 00:47:15,947
That was mean.

1083
00:47:16,117 --> 00:47:17,657
- What? - That was a little mean.

1084
00:47:18,117 --> 00:47:20,786
- No. - I might react like you too.

1085
00:47:21,327 --> 00:47:22,356
We'll see.

1086
00:47:24,297 --> 00:47:25,537
Our score would be 1 to 1 then.

1087
00:47:27,456 --> 00:47:28,467
That should be fun.

1088
00:47:30,967 --> 00:47:33,197
- Do you get jealous? - Jealous?

1089
00:47:34,936 --> 00:47:38,237
I do get jealous.

1090
00:47:38,577 --> 00:47:40,576
Is it about today?

1091
00:47:40,577 --> 00:47:43,347
No way. What are you talking about?

1092
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:45,617
Come on.

1093
00:47:45,916 --> 00:47:49,386
I wasn't jealous. Really.

1094
00:47:49,387 --> 00:47:52,516
Seriously, I wasn't.

1095
00:47:52,686 --> 00:47:54,686
No, I wasn't.

1096
00:47:54,827 --> 00:47:57,387
It was an interesting situation,

1097
00:47:57,556 --> 00:47:59,697
so I just wanted to talk about it and tease you.

1098
00:48:06,297 --> 00:48:08,835
I was just asking if you were the jealous type.

1099
00:48:08,836 --> 00:48:10,665
If you usually get jealous.

1100
00:48:10,666 --> 00:48:12,677
Regarding friends of the opposite gender?

1101
00:48:13,507 --> 00:48:15,777
Of course, men and women can be friends.

1102
00:48:16,646 --> 00:48:19,346
You must have friends of the opposite gender.

1103
00:48:19,347 --> 00:48:20,875
I think so too.

1104
00:48:20,876 --> 00:48:22,446
I think you "must" have those friends.

1105
00:48:22,447 --> 00:48:24,246
If you don't,

1106
00:48:24,617 --> 00:48:26,377
- That'd be rather weird. - that would be...

1107
00:48:26,786 --> 00:48:28,786
Let's say I had drinks with my guy friend alone.

1108
00:48:28,987 --> 00:48:30,455
We've been so close...

1109
00:48:30,456 --> 00:48:32,055
since we were little.

1110
00:48:32,056 --> 00:48:34,427
Then that is more unacceptable.

1111
00:48:35,396 --> 00:48:36,867
Are you out of your mind?

1112
00:48:38,666 --> 00:48:40,213
So your girlfriend should only have guy friends.

1113
00:48:40,237 --> 00:48:43,036
Yes. They should just exist.

1114
00:48:43,436 --> 00:48:44,507
She should just have them.

1115
00:48:44,737 --> 00:48:46,276
- What if they don't drink... - I should know about them.

1116
00:48:46,277 --> 00:48:49,206
And just talk about their worries at a café?

1117
00:48:49,777 --> 00:48:51,447
- Talking about worries at a café? - Yes.

1118
00:48:52,746 --> 00:48:53,777
What time?

1119
00:49:01,056 --> 00:49:02,427
You're quite jealous.

1120
00:49:02,726 --> 00:49:04,355
No, I'm okay with it...

1121
00:49:04,356 --> 00:49:05,836
as long as they don't drink together.

1122
00:49:12,097 --> 00:49:16,737
(Yun Ha and Cheol Hyeon at a dining bar at Jeungsan Station)

1123
00:49:19,436 --> 00:49:21,476
- Hello. - Welcome.

1124
00:49:43,626 --> 00:49:44,697
Oh, my.

1125
00:49:45,396 --> 00:49:48,066
(Yun Ha and Cheol Hyeon's Ring-ring Date)

1126
00:49:48,067 --> 00:49:49,936
- Let me take this off. - Okay.

1127
00:49:55,746 --> 00:49:56,746
I really wanted...

1128
00:49:57,706 --> 00:49:59,376
to have a drink with you.

1129
00:50:00,217 --> 00:50:01,987
- Me too. - I know!

1130
00:50:02,186 --> 00:50:03,246
Hello.

1131
00:50:03,617 --> 00:50:05,656
Do you want to have a drink some time?

1132
00:50:05,657 --> 00:50:07,317
Yes, that sounds good.

1133
00:50:07,927 --> 00:50:10,126
My heart is fluttering for real.

1134
00:50:10,427 --> 00:50:11,955
She's a musician.

1135
00:50:11,956 --> 00:50:15,427
I'm very into those in the music scene.

1136
00:50:15,697 --> 00:50:19,967
I wanted to learn more about Yun Ha's life.

1137
00:50:20,766 --> 00:50:22,705
- This is our first drink. - Finally!

1138
00:50:22,706 --> 00:50:24,106
(They finally got to have a drink.)

1139
00:50:27,376 --> 00:50:29,177
- It's good. - I like it.

1140
00:50:30,476 --> 00:50:32,146
Don't you like the atmosphere here?

1141
00:50:32,246 --> 00:50:34,276
Yes. When I came in,

1142
00:50:34,277 --> 00:50:36,415
you looked good with the chandelier.

1143
00:50:36,416 --> 00:50:37,487
Do you think so?

1144
00:50:38,617 --> 00:50:39,657
Yes.

1145
00:50:40,617 --> 00:50:42,526
I bought some bread for you.

1146
00:50:42,527 --> 00:50:43,625
Really?

1147
00:50:43,626 --> 00:50:44,756
Is it...

1148
00:50:44,757 --> 00:50:46,796
Thank you so much.

1149
00:50:46,797 --> 00:50:49,226
Cheol Hyeon loves bread.

1150
00:50:49,327 --> 00:50:51,796
He likes healthy bread.

1151
00:50:51,797 --> 00:50:53,567
It's screaming "countryside bread."

1152
00:50:54,097 --> 00:50:56,036
- You really love bread. - It's like rye bread.

1153
00:50:56,737 --> 00:51:00,276
(The first snow fell today.)

1154
00:51:00,277 --> 00:51:03,376
I would have given it to Jae Hyung,

1155
00:51:04,646 --> 00:51:06,117
but I changed my mind.

1156
00:51:07,217 --> 00:51:08,245
Excuse me.

1157
00:51:08,246 --> 00:51:10,915
- Okay. - This is burrata cheese salad.

1158
00:51:10,916 --> 00:51:12,855
- It looks so pretty. - Oh, my.

1159
00:51:12,856 --> 00:51:14,926
- Is this burrata cheese? - It is.

1160
00:51:14,927 --> 00:51:16,026
Do you like pulpo?

1161
00:51:16,027 --> 00:51:17,657
- I do. - Okay.

1162
00:51:17,956 --> 00:51:19,496
It must be salt.

1163
00:51:21,027 --> 00:51:22,067
It's fascinating.

1164
00:51:30,637 --> 00:51:32,336
- It's good. - It's tasty.

1165
00:51:32,876 --> 00:51:35,277
I want to hear you play your instrument.

1166
00:51:36,447 --> 00:51:38,016
I want to invite you.

1167
00:51:39,177 --> 00:51:40,745
Do you have a ritual?

1168
00:51:40,746 --> 00:51:43,015
When you have...

1169
00:51:43,016 --> 00:51:44,446
an important performance coming,

1170
00:51:44,447 --> 00:51:46,816
is there something you say to yourself?

1171
00:51:46,817 --> 00:51:49,785
- Like a ritual or practice? - Yes.

1172
00:51:49,786 --> 00:51:51,126
It's more important...

1173
00:51:51,597 --> 00:51:53,596
to practice enough.

1174
00:51:53,597 --> 00:51:55,665
- That's true. - Seriously,

1175
00:51:55,666 --> 00:51:57,625
if I want to play at 100 percent...

1176
00:51:57,626 --> 00:51:59,736
- You should practice 150 percent. - That's right!

1177
00:51:59,737 --> 00:52:04,035
I should practice 150 or even 200 percent.

1178
00:52:04,036 --> 00:52:06,177
- That's so cool. - Cheers.

1179
00:52:06,777 --> 00:52:08,376
I just realized...

1180
00:52:08,947 --> 00:52:12,246
that I like your eyes when you smile.

1181
00:52:12,376 --> 00:52:14,046
- You... - All of a sudden?

1182
00:52:14,047 --> 00:52:16,346
Can't suddenly have those smiling eyes overnight.

1183
00:52:16,347 --> 00:52:17,916
You don't feel blue when you're alone?

1184
00:52:18,056 --> 00:52:20,086
- No. - Not at all?

1185
00:52:20,217 --> 00:52:22,886
- Really? - I don't feel sad often.

1186
00:52:22,887 --> 00:52:24,157
I'm quite numb to sadness.

1187
00:52:27,757 --> 00:52:29,066
(Ji Won and Yong Woo at a sashimi place on Jebu Island)

1188
00:52:29,067 --> 00:52:30,827
- Here? - Do you like sashimi?

1189
00:52:31,027 --> 00:52:32,266
I love it.

1190
00:52:33,836 --> 00:52:34,836
Welcome, then.

1191
00:52:34,837 --> 00:52:36,867
Thank you.

1192
00:52:37,436 --> 00:52:38,436
Let me...

1193
00:52:38,876 --> 00:52:41,547
You have strong fingers. You're indeed a hunter.

1194
00:52:41,746 --> 00:52:42,876
A hunter?

1195
00:52:43,246 --> 00:52:44,806
The strength I use to pull the trigger.

1196
00:52:45,447 --> 00:52:47,415
- I'm hungry now. - I know.

1197
00:52:47,416 --> 00:52:50,116
When we were shooting, my stomach was rumbling.

1198
00:52:50,117 --> 00:52:52,585
I felt weak at the end because I was hungry.

1199
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:54,656
Right. I felt weak.

1200
00:52:54,657 --> 00:52:56,097
How long are they going to hang out?

1201
00:52:57,556 --> 00:52:59,725
- All day long. - They spend a long time together.

1202
00:52:59,726 --> 00:53:00,926
We'd like to get this special one.

1203
00:53:00,927 --> 00:53:03,265
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1204
00:53:03,266 --> 00:53:04,796
I'm so excited now.

1205
00:53:04,797 --> 00:53:07,866
- It's evening now. - I know.

1206
00:53:07,867 --> 00:53:09,406
The days have gone by quickly recently.

1207
00:53:09,407 --> 00:53:12,276
- I know. - Today went especially fast.

1208
00:53:12,277 --> 00:53:13,336
- It did? - Yes.

1209
00:53:13,476 --> 00:53:15,047
We did lots of things for sure.

1210
00:53:15,476 --> 00:53:16,947
Do you want to have a drink?

1211
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:18,347
That sounds good.

1212
00:53:18,476 --> 00:53:20,416
Let's have a casual drink to lift our spirits.

1213
00:53:29,126 --> 00:53:30,226
Do you like grilled clams?

1214
00:53:30,757 --> 00:53:32,196
Grilled clams? I like all kinds of seafood.

1215
00:53:32,197 --> 00:53:34,257
I love all seafood.

1216
00:53:35,697 --> 00:53:36,966
Thank you.

1217
00:53:36,967 --> 00:53:38,665
- Thank you. - Eat it right away when it's done.

1218
00:53:38,666 --> 00:53:39,797
- Okay. - Okay.

1219
00:53:40,637 --> 00:53:43,237
- Thank you for the meal. - Thank you for the meal.

1220
00:53:44,567 --> 00:53:45,836
Wasabi is the best.

1221
00:53:47,806 --> 00:53:49,645
Wasabi goes with everything.

1222
00:53:49,646 --> 00:53:50,706
Right?

1223
00:53:51,106 --> 00:53:52,447
We've only been eating.

1224
00:53:58,617 --> 00:54:00,887
- This is the way to go. - It's tasty.

1225
00:54:03,286 --> 00:54:05,625
The ramyeon is cooked just right to eat.

1226
00:54:05,626 --> 00:54:07,626
- Try it. - Try some.

1227
00:54:12,266 --> 00:54:15,406
Don't be surprised. We're at the beach,

1228
00:54:15,407 --> 00:54:17,265
- so fireworks are a must. - Fireworks.

1229
00:54:17,266 --> 00:54:18,637
It's a must at the beach.

1230
00:54:18,777 --> 00:54:20,935
The fireworks started early here.

1231
00:54:20,936 --> 00:54:21,947
Oh, my.

1232
00:54:27,016 --> 00:54:28,047
It's fresh.

1233
00:54:29,686 --> 00:54:31,317
- It's indeed tteokbokki, right? - Yes.

1234
00:54:32,016 --> 00:54:33,086
What is this?

1235
00:54:33,487 --> 00:54:35,027
- This is... - Is it squid?

1236
00:54:35,556 --> 00:54:36,826
It smells so good.

1237
00:54:36,827 --> 00:54:39,197
- I think it's steamed squid. - Steamed squid?

1238
00:54:42,067 --> 00:54:44,596
- How is it? - It's so flavourful.

1239
00:54:44,597 --> 00:54:45,766
Is it delicious?

1240
00:54:51,067 --> 00:54:53,577
You look like a chef.

1241
00:54:55,746 --> 00:54:58,046
(The chef is going crazy.)

1242
00:54:58,047 --> 00:54:59,077
How is it?

1243
00:54:59,416 --> 00:55:00,776
- Try it already. - Already?

1244
00:55:00,777 --> 00:55:02,015
It melts in your mouth.

1245
00:55:02,016 --> 00:55:03,716
You don't have to use your teeth to eat this.

1246
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:06,286
- Really? - I could eat this at 100 too.

1247
00:55:07,117 --> 00:55:09,387
- My gosh. - It's lobster.

1248
00:55:10,126 --> 00:55:11,355
- Thank you. - Sure.

1249
00:55:11,356 --> 00:55:13,426
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1250
00:55:13,427 --> 00:55:15,625
- This... - You did a good job at shooting,

1251
00:55:15,626 --> 00:55:16,626
- so you can have a big piece. - A pincer?

1252
00:55:16,627 --> 00:55:18,165
- Take the big pincer. - The big pincer?

1253
00:55:18,166 --> 00:55:20,435
It must've been left-handed.

1254
00:55:20,436 --> 00:55:22,137
It has big pincers.

1255
00:55:23,237 --> 00:55:24,637
It must be good.

1256
00:55:24,806 --> 00:55:26,637
- Do you like lobster? - I do.

1257
00:55:26,737 --> 00:55:29,205
I love shellfish.

1258
00:55:29,206 --> 00:55:31,876
- Me too. - I love lobster and crab.

1259
00:55:39,217 --> 00:55:40,286
It's tasty.

1260
00:55:44,586 --> 00:55:46,926
Did you have fun today without tiring yourself?

1261
00:55:46,927 --> 00:55:48,125
I had fun.

1262
00:55:48,126 --> 00:55:49,797
That's good.

1263
00:55:49,896 --> 00:55:51,097
I want to play another round.

1264
00:55:53,367 --> 00:55:55,105
You're still thinking about the shooting game.

1265
00:55:55,106 --> 00:55:56,435
It's because I had fun.

1266
00:55:56,436 --> 00:55:57,507
- You did? - Yes.

1267
00:55:58,177 --> 00:55:59,935
I told you I was a little competitive.

1268
00:55:59,936 --> 00:56:01,035
Today, the Doraemon doll...

1269
00:56:01,036 --> 00:56:02,145
- made me competitive. - Doraemon.

1270
00:56:02,146 --> 00:56:05,616
I didn't like its sly grin.

1271
00:56:05,617 --> 00:56:06,677
It was shot once...

1272
00:56:07,317 --> 00:56:08,686
and it smiled like this.

1273
00:56:09,146 --> 00:56:10,547
What are your first impressions...

1274
00:56:11,016 --> 00:56:13,756
of the guys since you met them for the first time?

1275
00:56:13,757 --> 00:56:16,256
- The guys? - You can answer simply.

1276
00:56:16,257 --> 00:56:17,257
Simply?

1277
00:56:17,586 --> 00:56:20,097
As for Jung Sub, he's sweet.

1278
00:56:21,597 --> 00:56:23,895
- He's too sweet. - He's sweet and thoughtful.

1279
00:56:23,896 --> 00:56:26,867
- He takes good care of me. - Right.

1280
00:56:27,166 --> 00:56:29,907
I thought Cheol Hyeon and I could have a smooth conversation.

1281
00:56:30,007 --> 00:56:32,276
He's an attentive listener.

1282
00:56:32,277 --> 00:56:33,375
I know.

1283
00:56:33,376 --> 00:56:35,376
- He's serious when we talk. - Right.

1284
00:56:35,777 --> 00:56:37,177
And Jae Hyung...

1285
00:56:38,047 --> 00:56:39,776
is a question mark for me.

1286
00:56:39,777 --> 00:56:42,415
- I'm not sure yet. - You don't know him yet.

1287
00:56:42,416 --> 00:56:45,116
If I have to add, he's cute.

1288
00:56:45,117 --> 00:56:46,157
Cute?

1289
00:56:46,387 --> 00:56:48,055
His MBTI is CUTE?

1290
00:56:48,056 --> 00:56:50,527
Yes. Very cute.

1291
00:56:50,987 --> 00:56:54,597
(This cute couple hasn't taken off yet.)

1292
00:56:55,927 --> 00:56:57,467
Did you bundle up?

1293
00:56:57,896 --> 00:56:59,797
You're wearing Gray.

1294
00:57:00,137 --> 00:57:01,166
Me too.

1295
00:57:02,637 --> 00:57:04,705
How about we have a dress code?

1296
00:57:04,706 --> 00:57:08,406
- What? - I'll wear Gray.

1297
00:57:08,407 --> 00:57:09,577
- Really? - Yes.

1298
00:57:10,146 --> 00:57:12,446
(Their dress code was Gray.)

1299
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:14,076
We were wearing matching outfits,

1300
00:57:14,077 --> 00:57:16,046
so I thought it was kind of cute.

1301
00:57:16,047 --> 00:57:18,086
"We're kind of cute."

1302
00:57:21,387 --> 00:57:23,347
I wanted to have a lot of conversations with him.

1303
00:57:23,456 --> 00:57:25,056
I thought I could learn a lot about him.

1304
00:57:25,396 --> 00:57:26,427
I was happy.

1305
00:57:28,226 --> 00:57:29,626
- Shall we take off? - Yes.

1306
00:57:32,936 --> 00:57:35,137
- I think it's here. - Here?

1307
00:57:37,536 --> 00:57:40,476
(Ju Yeon and Jae Hyung at a wine bar in Geumho-dong)

1308
00:57:44,206 --> 00:57:46,646
Doesn't it sound good? "Scotch egg?"

1309
00:57:46,976 --> 00:57:48,946
- These two and one pasta. - One pasta.

1310
00:57:48,947 --> 00:57:50,646
- Okay. - That would be good.

1311
00:57:53,217 --> 00:57:55,056
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1312
00:57:55,356 --> 00:57:56,956
- Shall we toast? - Cheers.

1313
00:58:00,327 --> 00:58:02,665
It's so good.

1314
00:58:02,666 --> 00:58:04,496
I didn't realize how tall you were.

1315
00:58:05,237 --> 00:58:08,435
As soon as I came in, you caught my eye.

1316
00:58:08,436 --> 00:58:10,306
- Why? - Because you were handsome.

1317
00:58:16,306 --> 00:58:17,806
- That's... - What is that?

1318
00:58:18,177 --> 00:58:19,475
We were...

1319
00:58:19,476 --> 00:58:21,245
- We were rooting for them. - Right.

1320
00:58:21,246 --> 00:58:22,415
I'm really cheering for Jae Hyung.

1321
00:58:22,416 --> 00:58:24,646
I know. I like this. I'm happy for him.

1322
00:58:24,786 --> 00:58:26,786
As if I was watching soccer.

1323
00:58:27,016 --> 00:58:30,185
It's my first time seeing someone with such strong facial features.

1324
00:58:30,186 --> 00:58:32,157
Usually, I relax my eyes.

1325
00:58:32,527 --> 00:58:33,656
If I fully open them, they get a lot bigger.

1326
00:58:33,657 --> 00:58:34,726
Right.

1327
00:58:35,126 --> 00:58:37,066
I could even make double eyelids.

1328
00:58:37,067 --> 00:58:38,996
That looks great.

1329
00:58:39,467 --> 00:58:40,467
Oh, dear.

1330
00:58:40,967 --> 00:58:42,836
(Their orders have been served.)

1331
00:58:44,766 --> 00:58:46,436
Thank you for the meal.

1332
00:58:48,907 --> 00:58:51,246
(Freshly fried fish and chips)

1333
00:58:56,847 --> 00:58:59,416
(It's hot.)

1334
00:59:00,217 --> 00:59:01,217
It's so good.

1335
00:59:01,218 --> 00:59:02,386
(It's too hot.)

1336
00:59:02,387 --> 00:59:03,387
Is it hot?

1337
00:59:03,987 --> 00:59:05,396
Have some water.

1338
00:59:06,726 --> 00:59:08,597
(He listens to her.)

1339
00:59:11,896 --> 00:59:12,967
I was shocked.

1340
00:59:16,637 --> 00:59:20,206
I saw it steaming like crazy.

1341
00:59:20,407 --> 00:59:23,406
That's Jae Hyung's charm, though.

1342
00:59:23,407 --> 00:59:25,246
Right. He can just see a doctor after this.

1343
00:59:26,376 --> 00:59:27,976
Even his finger hasn't been healed.

1344
00:59:28,786 --> 00:59:30,586
What is your ideal type?

1345
00:59:30,847 --> 00:59:33,286
In my ideal relationship,

1346
00:59:33,887 --> 00:59:37,955
the couple feels comfortable and secure around each other.

1347
00:59:37,956 --> 00:59:39,096
They don't have to be nervous.

1348
00:59:39,097 --> 00:59:40,996
- They don't have to be too polite. - Yes.

1349
00:59:41,226 --> 00:59:42,866
If I was in my early 20s,

1350
00:59:42,867 --> 00:59:45,536
I couldn't care much about it.

1351
00:59:46,036 --> 00:59:47,395
I thought you were in your early 20s.

1352
00:59:47,396 --> 00:59:48,737
Me? I'm a teenager.

1353
00:59:50,137 --> 00:59:52,036
That's why. I'm a minor.

1354
00:59:53,106 --> 00:59:55,777
You're a minor but already have a job.

1355
00:59:55,976 --> 00:59:57,976
I go to the office...

1356
00:59:58,177 --> 01:00:00,516
and take classes online.

1357
01:00:02,246 --> 01:00:03,317
You never back down.

1358
01:00:04,617 --> 01:00:06,015
- I get that a lot. - Right.

1359
01:00:06,016 --> 01:00:07,186
They say I never back down.

1360
01:00:07,387 --> 01:00:08,926
I usually let the other person have the last word.

1361
01:00:08,927 --> 01:00:10,487
- You do? - Yes.

1362
01:00:11,686 --> 01:00:14,225
He only seemed chic.

1363
01:00:14,226 --> 01:00:16,765
But it looks like he's charming in many ways.

1364
01:00:16,766 --> 01:00:20,396
He's serious and cute too.

1365
01:00:20,536 --> 01:00:22,805
I've never seen someone like him before.

1366
01:00:22,806 --> 01:00:24,867
That made me more curious about him.

1367
01:00:28,646 --> 01:00:30,407
It looks good.

1368
01:00:33,516 --> 01:00:35,286
- We're eating a lot today. - I know.

1369
01:00:37,416 --> 01:00:39,386
- Do you like cilantro? - I don't really enjoy it.

1370
01:00:39,387 --> 01:00:40,686
- Do you? - Not really.

1371
01:00:41,286 --> 01:00:43,987
I have the palate of a child.

1372
01:00:44,387 --> 01:00:45,526
(The man with a child's palate tries cilantro.)

1373
01:00:45,527 --> 01:00:46,527
Wait.

1374
01:00:48,797 --> 01:00:50,917
I tried some cilantro by itself, and it tastes weird.

1375
01:00:56,036 --> 01:00:58,936
- It tastes like soap. - Yes.

1376
01:00:59,376 --> 01:01:01,506
That's why I don't like cilantro too.

1377
01:01:01,507 --> 01:01:02,875
You have the palate of a child too.

1378
01:01:02,876 --> 01:01:03,946
Yes.

1379
01:01:03,947 --> 01:01:06,117
It's not common to find someone with a similar palate.

1380
01:01:06,677 --> 01:01:08,685
When you grilled pork belly...

1381
01:01:08,686 --> 01:01:11,887
- a few days ago, - Yes.

1382
01:01:12,257 --> 01:01:13,486
I was so happy.

1383
01:01:13,487 --> 01:01:15,225
- Really? - That day...

1384
01:01:15,226 --> 01:01:17,886
- we didn't really talk that much. - Right.

1385
01:01:17,887 --> 01:01:20,956
But I thought if I could go on a date again,

1386
01:01:21,097 --> 01:01:24,697
I wanted to do it with you.

1387
01:01:25,836 --> 01:01:27,367
Because I was good at grilling meat?

1388
01:01:29,137 --> 01:01:31,205
- Do you go to karaoke often? - Yes.

1389
01:01:31,206 --> 01:01:33,705
- Is that so? - I like singing after drinking.

1390
01:01:33,706 --> 01:01:35,036
Then do you want...

1391
01:01:35,277 --> 01:01:37,475
- Karaoke? - to have some more fun later?

1392
01:01:37,476 --> 01:01:38,676
- Really? - Yes.

1393
01:01:38,677 --> 01:01:40,246
- I would love to. - Okay.

1394
01:01:40,916 --> 01:01:42,346
- Shall we go? - Let's go.

1395
01:01:42,347 --> 01:01:43,416
Okay.

1396
01:01:43,786 --> 01:01:45,086
Thank you.

1397
01:01:46,887 --> 01:01:47,916
It's quite cold.

1398
01:01:48,827 --> 01:01:50,355
(Handing over her scarf)

1399
01:01:50,356 --> 01:01:51,586
Thank you.

1400
01:01:52,056 --> 01:01:54,257
How did you know I like pink?

1401
01:01:54,927 --> 01:01:57,427
- We should buckle our seat belts. - The seat belt.

1402
01:01:58,367 --> 01:02:00,697
Done. Now I'm safe.

1403
01:02:04,567 --> 01:02:06,876
My gosh. He's cute.

1404
01:02:08,237 --> 01:02:09,306
That was cute.

1405
01:02:10,577 --> 01:02:12,447
- Did you do that today? - What?

1406
01:02:12,777 --> 01:02:14,446
Our mission on a snowy day.

1407
01:02:14,447 --> 01:02:16,616
I didn't know it was snowing.

1408
01:02:16,617 --> 01:02:17,646
I didn't see it at all.

1409
01:02:18,657 --> 01:02:20,915
But it did snow, so you should complete the mission.

1410
01:02:20,916 --> 01:02:23,427
- Really? - Before the day ends.

1411
01:02:26,356 --> 01:02:27,927
The snowy day mission.

1412
01:02:29,027 --> 01:02:30,027
I wonder who did it.

1413
01:02:30,927 --> 01:02:33,436
I'm so curious.

1414
01:02:33,836 --> 01:02:34,936
I did it today.

1415
01:02:35,166 --> 01:02:36,266
- Really? - Yes.

1416
01:02:36,666 --> 01:02:37,666
I see.

1417
01:02:39,907 --> 01:02:43,406
I did it in a subtle way.

1418
01:02:43,407 --> 01:02:45,875
"I liked the pork belly you grilled."

1419
01:02:45,876 --> 01:02:48,145
"I loved the short conversation I had with you."

1420
01:02:48,146 --> 01:02:50,785
"I thought I wanted to go out with you if I had a chance."

1421
01:02:50,786 --> 01:02:53,086
I told him about these thoughts I had about him.

1422
01:02:53,556 --> 01:02:55,532
(Ju Yeon expressed her feelings in an indirect way for the mission.)

1423
01:02:55,556 --> 01:02:56,726
She was doing the mission?

1424
01:02:57,356 --> 01:02:58,855
- That was so natural. - She expressed her feelings.

1425
01:02:58,856 --> 01:03:00,196
He must have noticed that, right?

1426
01:03:00,197 --> 01:03:02,395
- You can do it in your own way. - I agree.

1427
01:03:02,396 --> 01:03:04,466
I don't think Jae Hyung noticed.

1428
01:03:04,467 --> 01:03:05,536
He didn't.

1429
01:03:06,637 --> 01:03:09,067
- Maybe he did. - No, he didn't.

1430
01:03:10,367 --> 01:03:11,435
Goodness.

1431
01:03:11,436 --> 01:03:13,605
- I had fun today. - Me too.

1432
01:03:13,606 --> 01:03:15,206
(Se Seung and Jung Sub's Ring-ring Date)

1433
01:03:15,976 --> 01:03:17,306
(Glancing over)

1434
01:03:18,146 --> 01:03:19,645
Why are you staring at me?

1435
01:03:19,646 --> 01:03:21,516
- I'm sorry. - Seriously.

1436
01:03:21,746 --> 01:03:23,346
I don't know what to do.

1437
01:03:23,347 --> 01:03:24,586
I'm sorry.

1438
01:03:24,947 --> 01:03:26,487
(She looks at him again.)

1439
01:03:26,887 --> 01:03:28,487
It should be fun, though.

1440
01:03:29,186 --> 01:03:30,186
What is?

1441
01:03:30,456 --> 01:03:32,396
The future.

1442
01:03:33,827 --> 01:03:35,396
I'm excited to see how things will go.

1443
01:03:36,396 --> 01:03:37,527
It will be fun.

1444
01:03:38,697 --> 01:03:41,166
(Staring)

1445
01:03:53,777 --> 01:03:55,586
Oh, dear.

1446
01:03:55,686 --> 01:03:57,346
- Seriously, though, - What are they doing?

1447
01:03:57,347 --> 01:03:58,347
When someone stares at you like that,

1448
01:03:58,348 --> 01:03:59,355
don't you get super nervous?

1449
01:03:59,356 --> 01:04:02,225
But didn't Jung Sub sound like...

1450
01:04:02,226 --> 01:04:05,085
he was a little uncomfortable?

1451
01:04:05,086 --> 01:04:06,955
- I thought he liked it. - Here's what I think.

1452
01:04:06,956 --> 01:04:09,625
- When a girl is staring at you, - It makes you shy?

1453
01:04:09,626 --> 01:04:10,725
And you make eye contact with her,

1454
01:04:10,726 --> 01:04:11,726
- It makes them very shy. - I see.

1455
01:04:11,727 --> 01:04:13,512
- I don't know what to do. - So that's what it is?

1456
01:04:13,536 --> 01:04:16,266
I hope someone looks at me like that too.

1457
01:04:18,706 --> 01:04:20,475
It makes my heart flutter.

1458
01:04:20,476 --> 01:04:21,535
Aren't you envious a little?

1459
01:04:21,536 --> 01:04:22,745
- I'm so envious. - I'm so envious.

1460
01:04:22,746 --> 01:04:25,076
- I hope someone looks at me... - Seriously.

1461
01:04:25,077 --> 01:04:26,146
Like that.

1462
01:04:26,717 --> 01:04:28,447
My life is hard.

1463
01:04:28,547 --> 01:04:30,085
Oh, no. Someone please look at him.

1464
01:04:30,086 --> 01:04:31,887
- No. There's no one. - That's life.

1465
01:04:46,396 --> 01:04:49,336
Why do I stare at him?

1466
01:04:51,467 --> 01:04:52,777
Because he's good-looking.

1467
01:04:54,577 --> 01:04:57,476
That day, my feelings about Se Seung...

1468
01:04:57,806 --> 01:05:01,646
became much more specific.

1469
01:05:02,016 --> 01:05:05,415
They were vague...

1470
01:05:05,416 --> 01:05:07,886
as if I was touching paper clay that didn't have a shape.

1471
01:05:07,887 --> 01:05:09,585
It has a shape now...

1472
01:05:09,586 --> 01:05:11,887
as I got to know more about her.

1473
01:05:11,987 --> 01:05:15,027
I'm definitely more interested in her than in others.

1474
01:05:15,257 --> 01:05:17,626
I could go out on a Cupid Date and Ring-ring Date...

1475
01:05:17,896 --> 01:05:20,896
with her twice in a row,

1476
01:05:21,396 --> 01:05:22,706
which I liked better.

1477
01:05:23,507 --> 01:05:26,306
It was much more meaningful.

1478
01:05:28,476 --> 01:05:30,547
It was an amusing twist of fate.

1479
01:05:31,547 --> 01:05:33,047
I'm so full.

1480
01:05:33,146 --> 01:05:34,376
- It was perfect. - Yes.

1481
01:05:36,646 --> 01:05:39,055
I had no idea that we would come to a beach.

1482
01:05:39,056 --> 01:05:42,086
It's on the list of my favourite dates.

1483
01:05:42,356 --> 01:05:46,226
Going to a beach, having delicious raw fish,

1484
01:05:47,097 --> 01:05:48,927
and watching the night sea.

1485
01:05:49,927 --> 01:05:51,395
- We did everything. - Yes.

1486
01:05:51,396 --> 01:05:52,642
- We really did everything today. - We did.

1487
01:05:52,666 --> 01:05:57,067
We even took a cable car. We did everything.

1488
01:05:57,467 --> 01:05:58,876
Is today your birthday?

1489
01:05:59,376 --> 01:06:00,376
Is it?

1490
01:06:01,137 --> 01:06:03,047
I beat you in shooting too.

1491
01:06:05,047 --> 01:06:07,076
- So it's... - A perfect day.

1492
01:06:07,077 --> 01:06:09,886
Think of it as my birthday gift.

1493
01:06:09,887 --> 01:06:12,016
- It's a gift? - As my birthday gift for you,

1494
01:06:12,117 --> 01:06:13,987
- You let me win? - I gave you the ranking...

1495
01:06:14,217 --> 01:06:16,456
rather than letting you win.

1496
01:06:17,327 --> 01:06:19,396
I'm very happy that I could give you a victory.

1497
01:06:19,956 --> 01:06:22,796
I had a lot of fun while talking to Ji Won.

1498
01:06:22,797 --> 01:06:25,766
Sometimes, I thought Ju Yeon...

1499
01:06:25,867 --> 01:06:27,467
was the only female version of me.

1500
01:06:27,896 --> 01:06:29,312
But our resemblance is in our looks.

1501
01:06:29,336 --> 01:06:32,507
When I was talking with her,

1502
01:06:32,606 --> 01:06:35,677
I thought we had a similar way of thinking.

1503
01:06:35,777 --> 01:06:37,476
And she thinks more deeply...

1504
01:06:37,577 --> 01:06:40,746
than me in a way.

1505
01:06:40,847 --> 01:06:43,117
She's fun and interesting.

1506
01:06:43,387 --> 01:06:45,717
That's what I thought during our conversation.

1507
01:06:46,117 --> 01:06:47,855
When we were on a date,

1508
01:06:47,856 --> 01:06:51,927
I felt comfortable, but I didn't at the same time.

1509
01:06:52,027 --> 01:06:55,896
It was positive discomfort.

1510
01:06:57,126 --> 01:06:59,407
I might've felt uncomfortable because my heart fluttered.

1511
01:06:59,436 --> 01:07:02,805
Or I might've been nervous,

1512
01:07:02,806 --> 01:07:04,736
trying to leave a good impression...

1513
01:07:04,737 --> 01:07:06,875
because he's the type of guy I always wanted to date.

1514
01:07:06,876 --> 01:07:09,547
Maybe that's why I was nervous.

1515
01:07:10,106 --> 01:07:12,677
I usually...

1516
01:07:12,777 --> 01:07:15,116
take care of my boyfriend.

1517
01:07:15,117 --> 01:07:18,185
I fill the emptiness...

1518
01:07:18,186 --> 01:07:21,555
or lack within him.

1519
01:07:21,556 --> 01:07:24,555
That's the way...

1520
01:07:24,556 --> 01:07:26,996
I feel love.

1521
01:07:27,097 --> 01:07:30,797
I think I dated people like that in many cases.

1522
01:07:30,896 --> 01:07:34,197
It's my job nature to take care of others.

1523
01:07:34,297 --> 01:07:36,007
In my family as well,

1524
01:07:36,106 --> 01:07:39,305
rather than being taken care of as a daughter,

1525
01:07:39,306 --> 01:07:41,376
I should take care...

1526
01:07:41,606 --> 01:07:43,806
of my parents more now.

1527
01:07:44,177 --> 01:07:47,177
So I want to date someone...

1528
01:07:47,347 --> 01:07:49,046
I can rest with...

1529
01:07:49,047 --> 01:07:51,186
and lean on.

1530
01:07:51,617 --> 01:07:53,956
Someone who can take care of me.

1531
01:07:54,856 --> 01:07:58,927
I want to be in a relationship where we can rely on each other.

1532
01:07:59,297 --> 01:08:02,157
That's what I think these days.

1533
01:08:03,427 --> 01:08:05,327
He's her ideal type.

1534
01:08:06,737 --> 01:08:07,935
- It seems she thinks... - Right.

1535
01:08:07,936 --> 01:08:09,106
That she was taken care of.

1536
01:08:09,306 --> 01:08:11,306
Is it because he has a younger sister?

1537
01:08:11,936 --> 01:08:13,136
Maybe.

1538
01:08:13,237 --> 01:08:14,553
I guess he naturally took care of her...

1539
01:08:14,577 --> 01:08:17,345
like he would take care of his younger sister.

1540
01:08:17,346 --> 01:08:19,675
He grew up while taking care of his sister.

1541
01:08:19,676 --> 01:08:20,876
- Right. - Yes.

1542
01:08:20,877 --> 01:08:23,117
I think it became like that naturally.

1543
01:08:23,216 --> 01:08:24,563
Things are going to work out well for them.

1544
01:08:24,587 --> 01:08:26,117
My heart is fluttering.

1545
01:08:32,756 --> 01:08:35,095
- It was a long day. - It was a long day.

1546
01:08:35,096 --> 01:08:36,473
(They're returning after the date.)

1547
01:08:36,497 --> 01:08:38,627
You can sleep comfortably in the car.

1548
01:08:39,037 --> 01:08:40,037
Okay.

1549
01:08:40,038 --> 01:08:42,398
- Make yourself at home. - I think you're already sleeping.

1550
01:08:42,537 --> 01:08:43,537
- Me? - It's so funny.

1551
01:08:43,538 --> 01:08:44,883
"You can sleep comfortably in the car."

1552
01:08:44,907 --> 01:08:46,407
Is this a dream by any chance?

1553
01:08:48,006 --> 01:08:50,207
Let's close our eyes then.

1554
01:08:51,247 --> 01:08:53,247
Don't draw anything on my face while I'm sleeping.

1555
01:08:54,777 --> 01:08:56,817
I'll draw Doraemon glasses.

1556
01:08:58,186 --> 01:08:59,466
What if I look like Nobi Nobita?

1557
01:09:01,157 --> 01:09:04,027
We're finally here. I'm going to listen to your singing.

1558
01:09:04,226 --> 01:09:05,425
Pick a song.

1559
01:09:05,426 --> 01:09:07,997
- Rock, paper, scissors. - Paper, scissors.

1560
01:09:08,096 --> 01:09:09,265
- Shoot. - Shoot.

1561
01:09:09,266 --> 01:09:10,266
(He's not the type that lets the other win.)

1562
01:09:10,267 --> 01:09:12,696
I should sing first? For real?

1563
01:09:12,697 --> 01:09:13,737
Of course.

1564
01:09:14,436 --> 01:09:16,635
Someone who is good should do it first.

1565
01:09:16,636 --> 01:09:17,636
Fine.

1566
01:09:19,176 --> 01:09:20,176
"Yarn?"

1567
01:09:20,707 --> 01:09:23,145
It's a rock ballad.

1568
01:09:23,146 --> 01:09:24,146
"Yarn."

1569
01:09:26,846 --> 01:09:29,947
Are you

1570
01:09:30,546 --> 01:09:33,186
Used to someone

1571
01:09:33,287 --> 01:09:36,856
Again?

1572
01:09:37,756 --> 01:09:40,256
I guess

1573
01:09:40,356 --> 01:09:44,827
He's very different

1574
01:09:44,926 --> 01:09:47,636
From me in the past

1575
01:09:48,197 --> 01:09:51,037
Is that why

1576
01:09:51,436 --> 01:09:54,936
You forgot about me?

1577
01:09:56,707 --> 01:09:59,045
My dear girl

1578
01:09:59,046 --> 01:10:01,675
You make me cry

1579
01:10:01,676 --> 01:10:03,946
I hope

1580
01:10:03,947 --> 01:10:08,916
We suffer the same pain

1581
01:10:08,917 --> 01:10:12,956
If you have to cry because of someone else

1582
01:10:12,957 --> 01:10:16,425
Cry in my arms

1583
01:10:16,426 --> 01:10:20,095
And let the wound

1584
01:10:20,096 --> 01:10:25,567
Heal

1585
01:10:29,006 --> 01:10:31,606
Oh, no. Why are you so good?

1586
01:10:32,777 --> 01:10:33,976
You sound amazing.

1587
01:10:35,046 --> 01:10:36,686
My nose is blocked.

1588
01:10:36,787 --> 01:10:39,056
So it sounds weird to me.

1589
01:10:40,117 --> 01:10:41,716
You can't get better than this.

1590
01:10:42,016 --> 01:10:43,657
He was an amazing singer.

1591
01:10:43,957 --> 01:10:45,426
It got me surprised.

1592
01:10:45,527 --> 01:10:49,026
I've heard others singing in a karaoke,

1593
01:10:49,027 --> 01:10:51,726
but his was my favourite.

1594
01:10:52,327 --> 01:10:54,236
So I just wanted to let him hold the mic...

1595
01:10:54,237 --> 01:10:55,805
and feed him water...

1596
01:10:55,806 --> 01:10:59,737
to hear him singing for three hours.

1597
01:10:59,837 --> 01:11:01,277
He was that good.

1598
01:11:11,046 --> 01:11:13,255
You're incredible.

1599
01:11:13,256 --> 01:11:15,586
Look at that. She has hearty eyes.

1600
01:11:15,587 --> 01:11:17,755
She fell in love.

1601
01:11:17,756 --> 01:11:20,425
- He has a manly side too. - I know.

1602
01:11:20,426 --> 01:11:23,395
When you see someone singing in a karaoke,

1603
01:11:23,396 --> 01:11:24,965
you can tell if they're singing for themselves...

1604
01:11:24,966 --> 01:11:26,666
or if they're doing it for someone else.

1605
01:11:26,667 --> 01:11:28,272
- He was singing for himself. - He was...

1606
01:11:28,296 --> 01:11:30,005
singing to please himself.

1607
01:11:30,006 --> 01:11:31,006
That's why I like it.

1608
01:11:31,007 --> 01:11:32,265
- I like it... - Right. That's why I like it.

1609
01:11:32,266 --> 01:11:33,826
Because he didn't do it to impress her.

1610
01:11:34,006 --> 01:11:35,707
He didn't do it to impress her at all.

1611
01:11:35,877 --> 01:11:39,247
I like it because he's never looked more confident since he came.

1612
01:11:40,417 --> 01:11:42,137
He's never looked more confident than that.

1613
01:11:43,046 --> 01:11:46,355
I think Jae Hyung doesn't care about what others think about him.

1614
01:11:46,356 --> 01:11:47,916
From day one to today.

1615
01:11:47,917 --> 01:11:49,656
- I like that side of him. - It's like Yong Woo's basketball.

1616
01:11:49,657 --> 01:11:51,925
- That's what makes him cool. - Yes. I respect him.

1617
01:11:51,926 --> 01:11:53,526
- Absolutely. - He does it in his way.

1618
01:11:53,527 --> 01:11:54,997
- Right. - I love it.

1619
01:11:55,997 --> 01:11:57,027
Hurry up and sing.

1620
01:11:57,867 --> 01:11:59,635
You're really good.

1621
01:11:59,636 --> 01:12:00,636
(He suddenly gets shy.)

1622
01:12:00,637 --> 01:12:02,367
You're not just good.

1623
01:12:02,466 --> 01:12:04,166
I haven't seen someone like him for a long time.

1624
01:12:04,167 --> 01:12:06,936
He was a good student. He's good-looking.

1625
01:12:07,037 --> 01:12:09,276
He's an amazing singer, and he's cute.

1626
01:12:09,277 --> 01:12:11,946
He has a nice personality. He's a good driver.

1627
01:12:11,947 --> 01:12:15,277
He's funny too. He has so many charms.

1628
01:12:15,617 --> 01:12:17,947
(It's Ju Yeon's turn.)

1629
01:12:18,247 --> 01:12:20,987
This is what I want to sing for you tonight

1630
01:12:21,686 --> 01:12:25,185
- You're the only one I love - You're the only one I love

1631
01:12:25,186 --> 01:12:28,157
- There's no one to listen - There's no one to listen

1632
01:12:28,256 --> 01:12:30,765
- It's raining - It's raining

1633
01:12:30,766 --> 01:12:32,566
- Before I know it - Before I know it

1634
01:12:32,567 --> 01:12:34,367
- Dawn is approaching - Dawn is approaching

1635
01:12:38,237 --> 01:12:39,407
She was a good singer.

1636
01:12:39,936 --> 01:12:42,377
She sang it with pure voice without using techniques.

1637
01:12:44,346 --> 01:12:47,976
(Coin Karaoke)

1638
01:12:48,146 --> 01:12:50,247
(The house in Seorae Village)

1639
01:12:51,617 --> 01:12:54,256
(Cho A came home from work.)

1640
01:12:55,856 --> 01:12:57,386
Where is everyone?

1641
01:12:58,787 --> 01:13:00,126
I think we're almost home.

1642
01:13:00,127 --> 01:13:01,647
(Yong Woo and Ji Won are almost home.)

1643
01:13:01,997 --> 01:13:04,795
Take the plushies we got today.

1644
01:13:04,796 --> 01:13:06,896
- Hot Pink? - Hot Pink.

1645
01:13:07,037 --> 01:13:09,907
- Saet Norae. - Hot Pink and Saet Norae.

1646
01:13:10,436 --> 01:13:12,276
- It's still... - It's so warm near the house.

1647
01:13:12,907 --> 01:13:15,635
- Compared to the beach. - Because it's not an open area?

1648
01:13:15,636 --> 01:13:16,646
I guess so.

1649
01:13:16,846 --> 01:13:18,207
What would the others be doing?

1650
01:13:19,106 --> 01:13:20,216
I wonder.

1651
01:13:24,117 --> 01:13:26,617
(She puts Hot Pink on the bed.)

1652
01:13:28,417 --> 01:13:30,327
(Jung Sub and Se Seung are back.)

1653
01:13:36,367 --> 01:13:37,867
How was your date?

1654
01:13:38,367 --> 01:13:40,135
- It was so cold. - Right?

1655
01:13:40,136 --> 01:13:41,765
I fought with the wind.

1656
01:13:41,766 --> 01:13:43,806
- Was it fun? - Yes.

1657
01:13:44,337 --> 01:13:45,436
Did you get closer?

1658
01:13:45,976 --> 01:13:47,907
Yes. I feel more comfortable now.

1659
01:13:53,877 --> 01:13:55,045
Where did you go?

1660
01:13:55,046 --> 01:13:56,316
I had a date today.

1661
01:13:56,317 --> 01:13:57,916
- You did? - Yes.

1662
01:13:57,917 --> 01:13:59,516
With Ji Won who came yesterday.

1663
01:14:00,487 --> 01:14:02,386
It did feel a little weird.

1664
01:14:02,487 --> 01:14:04,787
Because he went out on a date with someone else.

1665
01:14:05,087 --> 01:14:07,895
I thought...

1666
01:14:07,896 --> 01:14:10,326
he might grow feelings...

1667
01:14:10,327 --> 01:14:11,796
for the new person.

1668
01:14:12,027 --> 01:14:13,036
Was it fun?

1669
01:14:13,037 --> 01:14:15,167
We went to an island today.

1670
01:14:15,266 --> 01:14:16,567
- An island? - It was quite far.

1671
01:14:16,667 --> 01:14:18,305
Is it nearby?

1672
01:14:18,306 --> 01:14:20,976
No. We travelled for a long time. It was a three-hour round trip.

1673
01:14:21,337 --> 01:14:22,376
What did you do today?

1674
01:14:22,377 --> 01:14:24,706
I just finished work.

1675
01:14:24,707 --> 01:14:25,987
- You came home just now? - Yes.

1676
01:14:26,077 --> 01:14:27,576
You don't have much time to stay in the house.

1677
01:14:27,577 --> 01:14:29,247
- No. - Tomorrow,

1678
01:14:29,346 --> 01:14:31,986
I'll have the Ring-ring Date we talked about yesterday.

1679
01:14:31,987 --> 01:14:33,487
- Yes. - The random date.

1680
01:14:35,317 --> 01:14:38,027
You're very busy.

1681
01:14:38,226 --> 01:14:41,127
(Meanwhile, Se Seung looks busy.)

1682
01:14:43,466 --> 01:14:45,867
(She glances over once before going straight in a rush.)

1683
01:14:47,596 --> 01:14:49,706
- What are you doing? - What?

1684
01:14:49,707 --> 01:14:51,242
(He took the Introduction Yun Ha wrote.)

1685
01:14:51,266 --> 01:14:52,266
I...

1686
01:14:56,207 --> 01:14:58,345
- What's this? - They said it was not a big deal.

1687
01:14:58,346 --> 01:15:02,016
- So I prepared it lightly. - What's this?

1688
01:15:02,216 --> 01:15:03,447
- What? - What?

1689
01:15:03,987 --> 01:15:05,345
(He was given the note and the picture she had prepared.)

1690
01:15:05,346 --> 01:15:06,417
My goodness. What's this?

1691
01:15:06,516 --> 01:15:07,856
I didn't write it just now.

1692
01:15:09,627 --> 01:15:10,686
- You didn't? - No.

1693
01:15:10,787 --> 01:15:12,356
- I'll believe you. - What?

1694
01:15:13,127 --> 01:15:15,396
- This is... Are you serious? - Yes.

1695
01:15:18,596 --> 01:15:20,516
Things like this make my heart flutter a little.

1696
01:15:24,737 --> 01:15:26,237
Why are you suddenly running away?

1697
01:15:26,337 --> 01:15:27,706
- He likes it. - That's cute.

1698
01:15:27,707 --> 01:15:28,877
These two are...

1699
01:15:28,976 --> 01:15:30,345
I think they can just leave the house now.

1700
01:15:30,346 --> 01:15:32,146
- Right. - No.

1701
01:15:33,146 --> 01:15:34,866
- How dare you leave? - How dare you leave?

1702
01:15:34,947 --> 01:15:35,987
You can never leave.

1703
01:15:44,787 --> 01:15:45,787
This is cute.

1704
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:49,966
(He puts it in the bag.)

1705
01:15:52,226 --> 01:15:55,337
(Se Seung who was looking at the photo she took with Jung Sub)

1706
01:15:56,266 --> 01:15:59,006
(After staring at it for a while, )

1707
01:16:01,476 --> 01:16:03,976
(she fell asleep.)

1708
01:16:05,407 --> 01:16:07,377
- Yong Woo, you're here. - Yes.

1709
01:16:08,046 --> 01:16:10,385
There's something I want to brag about a little.

1710
01:16:10,386 --> 01:16:11,716
What is it?

1711
01:16:12,516 --> 01:16:13,685
(Bragging about being in 1st place)

1712
01:16:13,686 --> 01:16:15,157
- Hey. - Oh, my gosh.

1713
01:16:16,256 --> 01:16:17,736
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

1714
01:16:17,827 --> 01:16:19,003
Can you show me what that is really about?

1715
01:16:19,027 --> 01:16:20,907
- Thank you. - You're the first place for what?

1716
01:16:21,296 --> 01:16:22,296
It's crazy.

1717
01:16:23,226 --> 01:16:24,425
(Exclaiming)

1718
01:16:24,426 --> 01:16:25,866
- Wait. - Is this...

1719
01:16:25,867 --> 01:16:27,036
what you prepared yesterday?

1720
01:16:27,037 --> 01:16:29,037
- That's amazing. - I didn't prepare anything.

1721
01:16:29,136 --> 01:16:30,506
Oh, I did.

1722
01:16:30,867 --> 01:16:32,975
- I did. - You didn't prepare anything and...

1723
01:16:32,976 --> 01:16:35,037
- I did. - My goodness.

1724
01:16:35,136 --> 01:16:36,777
I have a question.

1725
01:16:36,877 --> 01:16:38,105
- Hold on. - What does it feel...

1726
01:16:38,106 --> 01:16:39,246
like to win all the time?

1727
01:16:39,247 --> 01:16:41,007
- I'm curious too. - What does it feel like?

1728
01:16:41,346 --> 01:16:42,846
I was extremely lucky.

1729
01:16:43,216 --> 01:16:44,936
This is the water given by the first place.

1730
01:16:45,287 --> 01:16:47,293
Can I get a glass of water from the first place too?

1731
01:16:47,317 --> 01:16:48,657
It will taste a little different.

1732
01:16:48,817 --> 01:16:50,457
- Let's spread the news. - Yes.

1733
01:16:50,556 --> 01:16:52,626
We should hang a banner in front of the house.

1734
01:16:52,627 --> 01:16:53,772
"The House of the First Place."

1735
01:16:53,796 --> 01:16:55,555
It's not like I raised him, but I was proud of him.

1736
01:16:55,556 --> 01:16:57,697
That's Jung Sub's charm.

1737
01:16:57,796 --> 01:16:59,226
When I watch him, I feel proud.

1738
01:16:59,327 --> 01:17:00,567
I'm proud of you.

1739
01:17:00,997 --> 01:17:02,197
Come on.

1740
01:17:02,396 --> 01:17:04,006
Give us a speech.

1741
01:17:06,806 --> 01:17:08,877
I did give a speech there.

1742
01:17:08,976 --> 01:17:10,976
- Really? - You did?

1743
01:17:11,306 --> 01:17:12,747
Did you mention us?

1744
01:17:13,646 --> 01:17:15,215
No way.

1745
01:17:15,216 --> 01:17:17,045
- Right. - There's no way he forgot about us.

1746
01:17:17,046 --> 01:17:18,987
We raised him so well.

1747
01:17:19,756 --> 01:17:21,486
- My goodness. - We did everything for you.

1748
01:17:21,487 --> 01:17:22,755
- Seriously. - What do you mean you raised me?

1749
01:17:22,756 --> 01:17:24,425
- We did everything for you. - Gosh.

1750
01:17:24,426 --> 01:17:26,756
And this is what we get?

1751
01:17:26,926 --> 01:17:29,096
There's no use in raising him.

1752
01:17:31,027 --> 01:17:32,027
(She's the most serious about teasing Jung Sub.)

1753
01:17:32,028 --> 01:17:34,095
Cho A.

1754
01:17:34,096 --> 01:17:36,105
First Place Sub came from work.

1755
01:17:36,106 --> 01:17:37,106
Cho A.

1756
01:17:37,107 --> 01:17:40,877
(1st Place Sub went to work.)

1757
01:17:41,077 --> 01:17:43,976
Where did everyone go? They're on a date, right?

1758
01:17:44,447 --> 01:17:47,947
Are you busy tomorrow?

1759
01:17:48,146 --> 01:17:49,646
I have a date tomorrow.

1760
01:17:49,747 --> 01:17:50,816
- You do? - Yes.

1761
01:17:50,817 --> 01:17:52,616
- Do you know your date? - I think I know.

1762
01:17:52,617 --> 01:17:53,617
- You do? - Yes.

1763
01:17:53,716 --> 01:17:55,555
Did you have fun? Where did you go?

1764
01:17:55,556 --> 01:17:56,685
Are we not allowed to talk about this?

1765
01:17:56,686 --> 01:17:58,756
It's just that you might be jealous.

1766
01:17:58,856 --> 01:17:59,856
"Jealous?"

1767
01:18:03,197 --> 01:18:04,696
I was joking.

1768
01:18:04,697 --> 01:18:05,996
- I was joking. - Right?

1769
01:18:05,997 --> 01:18:07,096
- Yes. - "Jealous?"

1770
01:18:07,636 --> 01:18:09,037
It's so embarrassing.

1771
01:18:09,506 --> 01:18:11,666
Who is your random date? You can talk about it.

1772
01:18:11,667 --> 01:18:14,337
Since you already had yours,

1773
01:18:15,136 --> 01:18:16,605
- For real. - you can talk about it...

1774
01:18:16,606 --> 01:18:18,377
with confidence now?

1775
01:18:18,707 --> 01:18:20,577
Why am I yelled at?

1776
01:18:21,016 --> 01:18:22,947
I'm not yelling at you.

1777
01:18:24,046 --> 01:18:27,386
(Jae Hyung continues to sing a medley at Ju Yeon's request.)

1778
01:18:27,917 --> 01:18:31,957
My feelings are showing

1779
01:18:33,056 --> 01:18:35,225
Jae Hyung is funny.

1780
01:18:35,226 --> 01:18:36,226
He's doing a concert.

1781
01:18:36,567 --> 01:18:39,166
You're leaving

1782
01:18:39,167 --> 01:18:43,436
Don't cry, don't be sad

1783
01:18:43,867 --> 01:18:47,207
(After singing by himself, he's singing a duet with her.)

1784
01:18:47,806 --> 01:18:50,206
- Should I say I called you - Should I say I called you

1785
01:18:50,207 --> 01:18:52,407
After longing for you?

1786
01:18:52,577 --> 01:18:53,617
It was fun.

1787
01:18:53,917 --> 01:18:55,676
I think I got closer to her.

1788
01:18:55,877 --> 01:18:57,616
I wanted to go out with her again...

1789
01:18:57,617 --> 01:18:59,346
if there's a next time.

1790
01:19:03,426 --> 01:19:04,827
What are you doing, Cho A?

1791
01:19:05,027 --> 01:19:07,395
- Why? - Why aren't you coming down?

1792
01:19:07,396 --> 01:19:08,725
I was going to.

1793
01:19:08,726 --> 01:19:09,796
- You were? - Yes.

1794
01:19:12,796 --> 01:19:13,867
Why did you come up?

1795
01:19:13,997 --> 01:19:15,135
I was wondering why you weren't coming.

1796
01:19:15,136 --> 01:19:16,337
- You were? - Yes.

1797
01:19:16,436 --> 01:19:17,635
What are they doing downstairs?

1798
01:19:17,636 --> 01:19:19,837
- They're going to eat a pecan pie. - Really?

1799
01:19:20,136 --> 01:19:22,606
So what did you do? Did you have fun?

1800
01:19:24,306 --> 01:19:26,747
I did. Yes.

1801
01:19:27,846 --> 01:19:30,417
We talked about jealousy today.

1802
01:19:30,516 --> 01:19:32,746
- So... - I see.

1803
01:19:32,747 --> 01:19:34,255
The topic of the conversation was jealously?

1804
01:19:34,256 --> 01:19:36,725
Yes. We talked about it earlier.

1805
01:19:36,726 --> 01:19:38,957
That's why.

1806
01:19:40,226 --> 01:19:42,426
Why? Are you jealous of someone?

1807
01:19:43,997 --> 01:19:45,466
No.

1808
01:19:47,867 --> 01:19:48,896
"No?"

1809
01:19:52,337 --> 01:19:54,636
Were you with your date all day?

1810
01:19:55,037 --> 01:19:57,345
No. I was very busy today.

1811
01:19:57,346 --> 01:20:00,215
- After going out... - After going there...

1812
01:20:00,216 --> 01:20:02,845
You must've been happy in both occasions.

1813
01:20:02,846 --> 01:20:05,447
You won first place and went out on a date.

1814
01:20:05,546 --> 01:20:07,186
Yes. I had a good time.

1815
01:20:07,987 --> 01:20:09,556
But...

1816
01:20:09,827 --> 01:20:12,186
- you were busy today as well. - Yes.

1817
01:20:12,457 --> 01:20:15,027
It's a pity.

1818
01:20:16,966 --> 01:20:17,966
It's a shame.

1819
01:20:21,037 --> 01:20:24,066
- Jung Sub. - Right.

1820
01:20:24,067 --> 01:20:26,536
His curiosity about Cho A...

1821
01:20:26,537 --> 01:20:27,576
- Right. - isn't satisfied yet.

1822
01:20:27,577 --> 01:20:29,135
- There was no time. - He keeps mentioning.

1823
01:20:29,136 --> 01:20:31,246
- They didn't have a chance. - No.

1824
01:20:31,247 --> 01:20:33,175
- He had a crush on her. - Yes.

1825
01:20:33,176 --> 01:20:34,616
He cooked eggs for her too.

1826
01:20:34,617 --> 01:20:38,145
Se Seung will get so mad if she watches this.

1827
01:20:38,146 --> 01:20:39,385
Yes.

1828
01:20:39,386 --> 01:20:42,157
- "You went to Sharosu-Gil with me." - Right.

1829
01:20:42,417 --> 01:20:43,426
It's a shame.

1830
01:20:46,426 --> 01:20:47,895
- It's a little... - I also think it's a shame.

1831
01:20:47,896 --> 01:20:50,166
- Right? - I'll stay in the house tomorrow.

1832
01:20:50,167 --> 01:20:51,395
- What are you doing tomorrow? - For the first time,

1833
01:20:51,396 --> 01:20:52,396
Tomorrow?

1834
01:20:52,397 --> 01:20:54,436
I'll be staying in the house all day.

1835
01:20:54,537 --> 01:20:56,265
I'm so glad to hear that.

1836
01:20:56,266 --> 01:20:58,136
What are they doing upstairs?

1837
01:20:58,707 --> 01:21:01,337
- Right. - We can't help but eat everything.

1838
01:21:02,606 --> 01:21:04,175
They're very considerate.

1839
01:21:04,176 --> 01:21:05,907
They want us to eat the pecan pie.

1840
01:21:06,207 --> 01:21:08,407
- I feel so warm inside. - That's why they're upstairs.

1841
01:21:08,617 --> 01:21:10,116
Is there no one for real?

1842
01:21:10,117 --> 01:21:11,246
(Yun Ha and Cheol Hyeon are back.)

1843
01:21:11,247 --> 01:21:13,657
- Is there no one? - There should be someone.

1844
01:21:13,856 --> 01:21:15,087
Did we come back early?

1845
01:21:19,027 --> 01:21:22,795
The rumour says that Ji Won...

1846
01:21:22,796 --> 01:21:24,265
is very funny.

1847
01:21:24,266 --> 01:21:25,496
- Really? - You did?

1848
01:21:25,497 --> 01:21:27,577
- Yes. That's what I heard. - Who told you about it?

1849
01:21:27,796 --> 01:21:29,196
Who told you about it?

1850
01:21:29,197 --> 01:21:30,957
Do you want to find the source of the rumour?

1851
01:21:31,167 --> 01:21:32,866
- I didn't know. - Where did the rumour start?

1852
01:21:32,867 --> 01:21:34,587
- I heard it from several people. - Really?

1853
01:21:34,636 --> 01:21:36,196
- "Several people?" - "Several people?"

1854
01:21:36,306 --> 01:21:39,747
It does seem she has a sense of humour.

1855
01:21:40,317 --> 01:21:41,877
- Humour? - Yes.

1856
01:21:42,346 --> 01:21:44,286
You look like a cat.

1857
01:21:44,287 --> 01:21:45,787
- A cat? - Right.

1858
01:21:45,886 --> 01:21:47,516
- A cat? - A Persian cat.

1859
01:21:47,787 --> 01:21:49,826
Persian cats are pretty, right?

1860
01:21:49,827 --> 01:21:50,856
- They are. - They are.

1861
01:21:51,356 --> 01:21:53,272
I think she asked because she wanted to hear it again.

1862
01:21:53,296 --> 01:21:55,026
- You wanted to hear the answer. - She wanted us to confirm it.

1863
01:21:55,027 --> 01:21:56,667
No.

1864
01:21:56,766 --> 01:21:59,027
- They're pretty. - I should ask a question like this.

1865
01:21:59,226 --> 01:22:01,537
- You're all jokesters. - Right.

1866
01:22:02,596 --> 01:22:03,796
- We're jokesters. - For real.

1867
01:22:04,167 --> 01:22:07,306
When will Jae Hyung and Ju Yeon come?

1868
01:22:11,106 --> 01:22:12,406
I received a message.

1869
01:22:12,407 --> 01:22:13,475
(On the 6th day, who made your heart flutter?)

1870
01:22:13,476 --> 01:22:15,316
(On the 6th day, who made your heart flutter?)

1871
01:22:16,117 --> 01:22:19,447
(They check their feelings once a day.)

1872
01:22:24,226 --> 01:22:25,226
Did you do it?

1873
01:22:25,587 --> 01:22:26,827
Not yet.

1874
01:22:31,926 --> 01:22:34,667
(A moment when they're honest about their feelings the most)

1875
01:22:46,476 --> 01:22:48,316
I contemplated more than I had done yesterday.

1876
01:22:49,417 --> 01:22:52,016
It was a cruel moment for me.

1877
01:22:53,046 --> 01:22:55,055
My feelings might've grown bigger.

1878
01:22:55,056 --> 01:22:56,457
Or are they getting bigger?

1879
01:22:58,487 --> 01:23:00,457
I might've sent the message...

1880
01:23:00,556 --> 01:23:03,127
on the day when the first snow fell to express my feelings.

1881
01:23:04,766 --> 01:23:08,166
"You looked cool all day."

1882
01:23:08,167 --> 01:23:10,607
"I'm looking forward to next time." I sent these to Jung Sub.

1883
01:23:12,237 --> 01:23:14,877
(Are we feeling the same thing?)

1884
01:23:14,976 --> 01:23:16,645
I had fun talking with him.

1885
01:23:16,646 --> 01:23:20,015
I thought I could sit...

1886
01:23:20,016 --> 01:23:21,016
and talk with him all day.

1887
01:23:21,017 --> 01:23:22,817
That's why I sent a message to Cheol Hyeon.

1888
01:23:32,127 --> 01:23:33,156
(Where are their hearts pointing at?)

1889
01:23:33,157 --> 01:23:34,957
The tall one with big eyes isn't here.

1890
01:23:36,226 --> 01:23:39,196
What? We all expected it.

1891
01:23:39,197 --> 01:23:40,867
But we don't know about Yong Woo.

1892
01:23:41,067 --> 01:23:42,295
The same thing happened...

1893
01:23:42,296 --> 01:23:43,305
after the date last time.

1894
01:23:43,306 --> 01:23:45,105
I'm so curious about his choice.

1895
01:23:45,106 --> 01:23:47,135
He's the only variable today.

1896
01:23:47,136 --> 01:23:48,136
- Just Yong Woo. - Right.

1897
01:23:48,377 --> 01:23:49,676
I feel bad for Cho A.

1898
01:23:49,777 --> 01:23:51,106
Right. I feel bad too.

1899
01:23:51,207 --> 01:23:53,176
Did you not drink at all?

1900
01:23:53,476 --> 01:23:55,515
Yes. I had a little bit of beer.

1901
01:23:55,516 --> 01:23:58,987
- What do you usually drink? - Soju is my favourite.

1902
01:24:01,356 --> 01:24:04,226
("It was nice that I got to know you more.")

1903
01:24:08,226 --> 01:24:11,095
("You looked cool all day. I'm looking forward to next time.")

1904
01:24:11,096 --> 01:24:13,796
Se Seung. Because I spent the whole day with her.

1905
01:24:15,067 --> 01:24:17,567
(They felt the same thing today as well.)

1906
01:24:18,037 --> 01:24:20,976
(One person chose your sibling.)

1907
01:24:21,606 --> 01:24:23,676
She's doing well.

1908
01:24:24,606 --> 01:24:26,846
I think it's Cheol Hyeon who sent a message.

1909
01:24:27,777 --> 01:24:31,447
I think he started to notice her charm.

1910
01:24:31,546 --> 01:24:34,056
I think their relationship is getting stable,

1911
01:24:34,587 --> 01:24:35,686
which makes me happy.

1912
01:24:43,027 --> 01:24:46,027
("I think I was waiting for this conversation. I loved it!")

1913
01:24:51,006 --> 01:24:53,606
I sent a message to Yun Ha.

1914
01:24:53,976 --> 01:24:56,305
I had a great time with her during the dinner.

1915
01:24:56,306 --> 01:24:58,606
No matter what topic we talked about,

1916
01:24:58,846 --> 01:25:01,376
our conversation ended pleasantly,

1917
01:25:01,377 --> 01:25:03,216
which was amazing.

1918
01:25:03,417 --> 01:25:05,515
So Cheol Hyeon had a great time...

1919
01:25:05,516 --> 01:25:07,556
just like I did.

1920
01:25:11,426 --> 01:25:12,855
("I had a great time thanks to you. Let's talk again later.")

1921
01:25:12,856 --> 01:25:13,856
We felt the same thing.

1922
01:25:14,127 --> 01:25:16,596
It must be Yun Ha. I didn't doubt it.

1923
01:25:20,837 --> 01:25:23,506
("Let's go and eat meat again next time.")

1924
01:25:27,537 --> 01:25:29,675
I think it's Ju Yeon.

1925
01:25:29,676 --> 01:25:31,806
She kept talking about it during the date.

1926
01:25:32,247 --> 01:25:34,277
She must've liked it a lot.

1927
01:25:34,516 --> 01:25:38,015
I thought he had a lot of unexpected sides of him.

1928
01:25:38,016 --> 01:25:40,617
"He's someone I can't figure out within a single day."

1929
01:25:40,787 --> 01:25:43,556
I wanted to go on more dates with Jae Hyung.

1930
01:25:46,926 --> 01:25:50,466
(The first snow is here.)

1931
01:26:00,006 --> 01:26:01,936
He's extraordinary.

1932
01:26:02,407 --> 01:26:03,506
What's amazing is,

1933
01:26:03,707 --> 01:26:07,077
on our way to the karaoke, when I asked if he saw the snow...

1934
01:26:07,176 --> 01:26:08,645
and if he sent a message,

1935
01:26:08,646 --> 01:26:10,947
I didn't mean he should send it to me.

1936
01:26:11,046 --> 01:26:12,546
But Jae Hyung...

1937
01:26:12,987 --> 01:26:16,117
sent me a message saying "The first snow is here."

1938
01:26:16,216 --> 01:26:17,426
My heart fluttered a lot.

1939
01:26:19,186 --> 01:26:22,327
(The two have gotten closer to each other.)

1940
01:26:24,096 --> 01:26:25,376
Are you doing anything tomorrow?

1941
01:26:25,527 --> 01:26:26,936
I'm going to Gwangju.

1942
01:26:27,037 --> 01:26:29,796
Is that the one you have to leave early in the morning for?

1943
01:26:29,896 --> 01:26:30,935
- Yes. - Gosh.

1944
01:26:30,936 --> 01:26:31,936
At 6am?

1945
01:26:32,037 --> 01:26:33,906
Well, we have a pilot here.

1946
01:26:33,907 --> 01:26:35,427
Why don't you take her straight there?

1947
01:26:36,436 --> 01:26:39,305
- You know, what is it called? - Yes.

1948
01:26:39,306 --> 01:26:41,175
- Runway. - Runway.

1949
01:26:41,176 --> 01:26:42,645
There has to be a runway.

1950
01:26:42,646 --> 01:26:44,145
I see. A runway.

1951
01:26:44,146 --> 01:26:45,146
"It's Ji Won."

1952
01:26:45,546 --> 01:26:47,786
"She's teasing me until right before she goes to sleep."

1953
01:26:47,917 --> 01:26:50,255
When we're together, the conversation...

1954
01:26:50,256 --> 01:26:52,226
doesn't flow smoothly like water. It's more like,

1955
01:26:52,327 --> 01:26:55,026
we go back and forth with each other.

1956
01:26:55,027 --> 01:26:56,497
Being like that with Ji Won is fun.

1957
01:26:57,197 --> 01:26:58,627
When we were shooting,

1958
01:26:58,726 --> 01:27:02,367
he tried three times to win the plushie.

1959
01:27:02,636 --> 01:27:04,465
But he couldn't get it.

1960
01:27:04,466 --> 01:27:06,876
He kept talking about it while we ate too.

1961
01:27:06,877 --> 01:27:10,247
So I gave him a nickname. "Yong Woo-aemon."

1962
01:27:10,846 --> 01:27:14,476
I think the two of us had the most fun when we were shooting.

1963
01:27:20,386 --> 01:27:22,117
(He received another message.)

1964
01:27:22,917 --> 01:27:25,827
(Goodnight.)

1965
01:27:27,027 --> 01:27:30,167
I think it could be Cho A.

1966
01:27:30,827 --> 01:27:32,366
But I'm not thinking about her much,

1967
01:27:32,367 --> 01:27:35,296
because we haven't been spending time together.

1968
01:27:37,337 --> 01:27:39,336
I sent a message to Yong Woo.

1969
01:27:39,337 --> 01:27:42,606
We're having a Ring-ring Date tomorrow.

1970
01:27:42,707 --> 01:27:44,746
At the end of that call,

1971
01:27:44,747 --> 01:27:46,715
I hung up after saying "Goodnight."

1972
01:27:46,716 --> 01:27:48,156
So I was letting him know it was me.

1973
01:27:48,917 --> 01:27:52,386
(He received messages from two people.)

1974
01:27:54,686 --> 01:27:58,527
(Where's Yong Woo's heart headed?)

1975
01:27:58,726 --> 01:28:01,595
We had fun during our date,

1976
01:28:01,596 --> 01:28:02,796
so I think my hopes that...

1977
01:28:02,896 --> 01:28:05,296
he'd send me a message got bigger.

1978
01:28:05,497 --> 01:28:07,643
I thought it was possible that he wouldn't send it to me.

1979
01:28:07,667 --> 01:28:09,935
"If I don't get the messages I've been getting,"

1980
01:28:09,936 --> 01:28:12,506
"I wouldn't feel the best."

1981
01:28:13,777 --> 01:28:15,975
Considering the situation, I thought lying...

1982
01:28:15,976 --> 01:28:17,877
could be even more hurtful.

1983
01:28:18,077 --> 01:28:19,976
I thought she was someone...

1984
01:28:20,077 --> 01:28:22,577
who would understand me being true to how I feel.

1985
01:28:26,917 --> 01:28:28,586
I think he sent it to Ji Won.

1986
01:28:28,587 --> 01:28:29,587
Me too.

1987
01:28:30,487 --> 01:28:31,787
They were together all day.

1988
01:28:33,556 --> 01:28:34,627
What's going on?

1989
01:28:39,096 --> 01:28:42,667
(You did great today. Tomorrow I'm sleeping in.)

1990
01:28:42,796 --> 01:28:45,265
- That's Yong Woo. - Gosh.

1991
01:28:45,266 --> 01:28:46,667
- That's him. - It's Yong Woo.

1992
01:28:48,006 --> 01:28:50,247
That's such a twist. I would have never thought...

1993
01:28:50,676 --> 01:28:52,447
What is he doing?

1994
01:28:53,207 --> 01:28:56,546
(You did great today. Tomorrow I'm sleeping in.)

1995
01:28:57,987 --> 01:28:59,817
(Yong Woo's feelings...)

1996
01:29:00,817 --> 01:29:02,617
(went to Cho A.)

1997
01:29:03,287 --> 01:29:05,856
He'd gone on a date with Ji Won,

1998
01:29:05,987 --> 01:29:08,526
but he still sent his message...

1999
01:29:08,527 --> 01:29:10,055
to me consistently.

2000
01:29:10,056 --> 01:29:13,196
I thought, "He's showing me his conviction."

2001
01:29:13,197 --> 01:29:14,867
It made me like him even more.

2002
01:29:15,636 --> 01:29:19,306
I almost spent an entire day with Ji Won,

2003
01:29:19,707 --> 01:29:22,176
but I found myself sending a message to Cho A.

2004
01:29:22,877 --> 01:29:25,676
"Are my feelings for Cho A..."

2005
01:29:26,006 --> 01:29:29,777
"bigger than I thought?"

2006
01:29:31,087 --> 01:29:33,345
(After hesitating for a while, )

2007
01:29:33,346 --> 01:29:35,886
(he sent a message to Cho A.)

2008
01:29:36,317 --> 01:29:39,527
(All messages have been sent.)

2009
01:29:40,027 --> 01:29:42,295
I think he sent it to Cho A.

2010
01:29:42,296 --> 01:29:43,965
While I was talking to Yong Woo, he mentioned...

2011
01:29:43,966 --> 01:29:46,526
there was someone he hadn't been able to talk to...

2012
01:29:46,527 --> 01:29:49,265
because she's away for work a lot.

2013
01:29:49,266 --> 01:29:52,067
I think that gave me a hint.

2014
01:29:53,306 --> 01:29:56,606
(The message she's been waiting for did not arrive.)

2015
01:30:05,947 --> 01:30:08,317
To be honest, I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel sorry.

2016
01:30:08,417 --> 01:30:11,185
Since her 1st day, that 1st moment, she's been...

2017
01:30:11,186 --> 01:30:12,385
showing me she has feelings.

2018
01:30:12,386 --> 01:30:15,457
I think she'll be thinking, "We spent the whole day together."

2019
01:30:16,426 --> 01:30:19,997
But that's not how I felt.

2020
01:30:21,497 --> 01:30:24,136
For me, it was just that we could talk to each other...

2021
01:30:24,567 --> 01:30:28,936
and maybe we could get to know each other better.

2022
01:30:29,407 --> 01:30:32,506
I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel sorry at all.

2023
01:30:39,747 --> 01:30:41,287
I just...

2024
01:30:42,587 --> 01:30:46,756
felt like, "This is is the kind of person I want to be with."

2025
01:30:47,197 --> 01:30:50,197
"But I guess I'm not it for him."

2026
01:30:50,796 --> 01:30:52,497
"I can't control how he feels."

2027
01:30:53,296 --> 01:30:55,037
That's what I realized that day.

2028
01:31:07,577 --> 01:31:08,616
I didn't expect that.

2029
01:31:08,617 --> 01:31:10,616
He said that because of this situation,

2030
01:31:10,617 --> 01:31:12,746
he doesn't want to lie.

2031
01:31:12,747 --> 01:31:14,786
So what he meant was even though they went on a date,

2032
01:31:14,787 --> 01:31:15,787
- His feelings are still... - Yes.

2033
01:31:15,788 --> 01:31:17,468
- only for Cho A. - His heart is with her.

2034
01:31:17,556 --> 01:31:19,526
- Gosh. - I mean, I understand that.

2035
01:31:19,527 --> 01:31:21,255
But think about it from Ji Won's perspective.

2036
01:31:21,256 --> 01:31:23,667
- I would feel so... - I'd have flipped the gun so quick.

2037
01:31:24,396 --> 01:31:25,466
Then if...

2038
01:31:26,896 --> 01:31:28,465
you were Yong Woo,

2039
01:31:28,466 --> 01:31:29,895
- would you have sent it to Ji Won? - Yes.

2040
01:31:29,896 --> 01:31:32,706
Because it's, "Who made your heart flutter today?"

2041
01:31:32,707 --> 01:31:35,106
And he spent all day with one woman,

2042
01:31:35,277 --> 01:31:36,576
and didn't with the other.

2043
01:31:36,577 --> 01:31:37,577
He didn't.

2044
01:31:37,676 --> 01:31:39,805
But, of course, this is about his feelings,

2045
01:31:39,806 --> 01:31:41,277
so I can't tell him what to do.

2046
01:31:41,476 --> 01:31:43,117
- But if I were him, - This is sad.

2047
01:31:43,317 --> 01:31:44,345
I would have sent it to Ji Won...

2048
01:31:44,346 --> 01:31:46,916
- saying "I had fun today." - Ji Won.

2049
01:31:46,917 --> 01:31:48,656
And then I'd have devoted myself to tomorrow.

2050
01:31:48,657 --> 01:31:50,925
It must have been so hard for Yong Woo.

2051
01:31:50,926 --> 01:31:53,226
Of course, it would have been hard for Yong Woo.

2052
01:31:53,327 --> 01:31:54,855
But hasn't Yong Woo...

2053
01:31:54,856 --> 01:31:56,895
only been sending messages to Cho A?

2054
01:31:56,896 --> 01:31:59,027
- This whole time? - Right, from the beginning.

2055
01:31:59,596 --> 01:32:01,896
(Jae Hyung and Ju Yeon are home.)

2056
01:32:02,636 --> 01:32:04,265
- They're here. - They are?

2057
01:32:04,266 --> 01:32:06,636
- Jae Hyung. - We're back.

2058
01:32:07,176 --> 01:32:09,135
Why did you come home so late? Goodness.

2059
01:32:09,136 --> 01:32:10,345
- I mean, - What's that?

2060
01:32:10,346 --> 01:32:11,475
- what? - What's up with the pink?

2061
01:32:11,476 --> 01:32:14,045
This is Ju Yeon's.

2062
01:32:14,046 --> 01:32:16,016
- Her scarf? - Shouldn't it be the opposite?

2063
01:32:16,117 --> 01:32:17,816
He looked good in pink,

2064
01:32:17,817 --> 01:32:18,986
- so I let him borrow it. - I mean,

2065
01:32:18,987 --> 01:32:21,916
- your neck is... - Why did you come home so late?

2066
01:32:21,917 --> 01:32:24,056
- We were the last ones to leave. - We left late.

2067
01:32:24,157 --> 01:32:25,456
We did a lot of different things.

2068
01:32:25,457 --> 01:32:26,486
We left really late.

2069
01:32:26,487 --> 01:32:28,556
Were you guests at a wedding?

2070
01:32:28,796 --> 01:32:30,566
- Right. You look like... - She suggested we match.

2071
01:32:30,567 --> 01:32:32,295
Your outfits look similar.

2072
01:32:32,296 --> 01:32:34,896
Is that what people call "similar look?"

2073
01:32:37,167 --> 01:32:39,167
Since we're matching...

2074
01:32:39,567 --> 01:32:41,306
(The doorbell rang.)

2075
01:32:41,537 --> 01:32:43,305
- Go, go. Go bring it. - Ji Won.

2076
01:32:43,306 --> 01:32:44,345
Gosh, it's so...

2077
01:32:44,346 --> 01:32:46,105
- What is it? - Ji Won's going to open it today.

2078
01:32:46,106 --> 01:32:47,116
I see.

2079
01:32:47,117 --> 01:32:49,377
(A letter arrived.)

2080
01:32:55,386 --> 01:32:57,026
- Be serious? - We got a letter.

2081
01:32:57,027 --> 01:32:58,385
We got a letter.

2082
01:32:58,386 --> 01:32:59,885
- We got a letter. - It's cool.

2083
01:32:59,886 --> 01:33:02,527
- Gosh. - What? What is it?

2084
01:33:03,766 --> 01:33:05,406
- What is it? - As soon as I opened it...

2085
01:33:06,426 --> 01:33:07,772
- Gosh. - Is it a new participant?

2086
01:33:07,796 --> 01:33:09,096
What? No way.

2087
01:33:09,197 --> 01:33:10,942
- There's already so many of us. - Really? Why...

2088
01:33:10,966 --> 01:33:14,176
"We'll be going on an overnight trip to Gangwon Province."

2089
01:33:16,306 --> 01:33:18,476
An overnight trip was something totally unexpected.

2090
01:33:18,676 --> 01:33:20,716
That was so unexpected.

2091
01:33:20,817 --> 01:33:22,777
Overnight? Gangwon Province?

2092
01:33:23,577 --> 01:33:25,646
I mean, how are we supposed to get there?

2093
01:33:26,216 --> 01:33:28,216
Gangwon Province is very far.

2094
01:33:30,117 --> 01:33:32,527
- Overnight? Not just for a day? - Yes.

2095
01:33:32,686 --> 01:33:34,425
The male participants...

2096
01:33:34,426 --> 01:33:37,067
will choose who they want to travel with.

2097
01:33:37,167 --> 01:33:38,595
Use the telephone on the first floor...

2098
01:33:38,596 --> 01:33:41,537
and call the number below to express your feelings.

2099
01:33:42,167 --> 01:33:44,367
An overnight trip to Gangwon Province?

2100
01:33:46,466 --> 01:33:47,976
Gosh, wait.

2101
01:33:48,476 --> 01:33:51,605
You can't pick someone you went on a Speed Date...

2102
01:33:51,606 --> 01:33:52,707
or Ring-ring Date with.

2103
01:33:53,846 --> 01:33:55,715
- That's good! - Really?

2104
01:33:55,716 --> 01:33:58,646
Good! This is what I wanted to see.

2105
01:33:58,886 --> 01:33:59,886
Finally.

2106
01:33:59,887 --> 01:34:01,956
- Gosh, what's going on? - It's really...

2107
01:34:01,957 --> 01:34:03,185
- the start of a tectonic shift. - Serves you right.

2108
01:34:03,186 --> 01:34:04,656
- Goodbye. - What will happen from now on?

2109
01:34:04,657 --> 01:34:06,686
- Bye, bye, Se Seung. - My gosh.

2110
01:34:07,856 --> 01:34:09,957
I was so jealous.

2111
01:34:10,226 --> 01:34:13,196
You can't pick someone you went on a Speed Date...

2112
01:34:13,197 --> 01:34:14,396
or Ring-ring Date with.

2113
01:34:14,596 --> 01:34:15,596
(Gosh)

2114
01:34:16,396 --> 01:34:17,406
I was so disappointed.

2115
01:34:17,407 --> 01:34:19,667
I wanted to go on another date with Jae Hyung.

2116
01:34:19,867 --> 01:34:23,277
But since they said I couldn't,

2117
01:34:23,877 --> 01:34:25,546
This is shocking.

2118
01:34:26,046 --> 01:34:29,046
The idea of going on a date with another person itself is nice.

2119
01:34:29,377 --> 01:34:32,346
But that date is an overnight trip to Gangwon Province.

2120
01:34:32,417 --> 01:34:34,716
It's a very special date.

2121
01:34:36,186 --> 01:34:38,426
If the date is special,

2122
01:34:38,527 --> 01:34:41,226
the person you go on that date feels special too.

2123
01:34:41,327 --> 01:34:45,266
This is an overnight date unlike all the other dates.

2124
01:34:45,367 --> 01:34:48,497
So you'll be with that person for a very long time.

2125
01:34:48,596 --> 01:34:51,737
The person I can spend time with comfortably...

2126
01:34:51,837 --> 01:34:53,066
is someone I should choose.

2127
01:34:53,067 --> 01:34:55,675
I tend to prefer getting to know one person...

2128
01:34:55,676 --> 01:34:57,077
on a deeper level.

2129
01:34:57,277 --> 01:35:00,876
But I have to put Yong Woo, who I want to get to know better, aside...

2130
01:35:00,877 --> 01:35:03,817
and get to know someone else all over again.

2131
01:35:04,046 --> 01:35:06,645
So I was worried about that part.

2132
01:35:06,646 --> 01:35:09,015
So you can't choose the same person.

2133
01:35:09,016 --> 01:35:11,536
Right. You can't choose someone you've already had a date with.

2134
01:35:12,627 --> 01:35:14,026
But if you're sitting on the couch...

2135
01:35:14,027 --> 01:35:16,095
while I'm on the phone, wouldn't you hear everything?

2136
01:35:16,096 --> 01:35:19,567
I couldn't hear anything. We did it here yesterday.

2137
01:35:19,867 --> 01:35:21,997
If you made up your mind, go ahead.

2138
01:35:22,096 --> 01:35:23,497
See you.

2139
01:35:23,966 --> 01:35:27,006
Five, one, nine... Eight, seven.

2140
01:35:28,777 --> 01:35:30,907
(The first person to make a call, Jae Hyung)

2141
01:35:33,146 --> 01:35:35,016
(He calls the number without any hesitation.)

2142
01:35:35,216 --> 01:35:36,216
What?

2143
01:35:36,777 --> 01:35:38,046
He's going straight in.

2144
01:35:38,817 --> 01:35:42,856
Jae Hyung went to make the first call and didn't hesitate.

2145
01:35:42,957 --> 01:35:46,627
Who was Jae Hyung that eager to choose?

2146
01:35:48,497 --> 01:35:50,157
I was the first one to call.

2147
01:35:52,266 --> 01:35:54,395
So we could go on the trip with our siblings.

2148
01:35:54,396 --> 01:35:55,537
(He blocked them out.)

2149
01:35:59,006 --> 01:36:01,806
Press the number of the person you want to go on a date with.

2150
01:36:02,207 --> 01:36:03,975
One, Se Seung. Two, Cho A.

2151
01:36:03,976 --> 01:36:06,675
Three, Ju Yeon. Four, Yun Ha.

2152
01:36:06,676 --> 01:36:08,516
- Hello? - If you wish to hear the numbers...

2153
01:36:08,877 --> 01:36:11,317
Did I... Did I call the wrong number?

2154
01:36:14,856 --> 01:36:16,116
I was a bit flustered.

2155
01:36:16,117 --> 01:36:19,827
I wasn't focusing, and it kind of cut off.

2156
01:36:20,157 --> 01:36:22,096
(2nd try)

2157
01:36:30,136 --> 01:36:32,837
Press the number of the person you want to go on a date with.

2158
01:36:33,237 --> 01:36:35,736
One, Se Seung. Two, Cho A. Three, Ju Yeon.

2159
01:36:35,737 --> 01:36:37,805
Four, Yun Ha. Five, Ji Won.

2160
01:36:37,806 --> 01:36:41,277
If you wish to hear the numbers again, say "Repeat numbers."

2161
01:36:44,947 --> 01:36:46,417
Repeat numbers.

2162
01:36:48,056 --> 01:36:50,015
(He's grabbing his head.)

2163
01:36:50,016 --> 01:36:51,055
(The person Jae Hyung can go on a date with is Cho A.)

2164
01:36:51,056 --> 01:36:53,657
Press the number of the person you want to go on a date with.

2165
01:36:54,296 --> 01:36:56,855
One, Se Seung. Two, Cho A. Three, Ju Yeon.

2166
01:36:56,856 --> 01:36:58,726
Four, Yun Ha. Five, Ji Won.

2167
01:36:59,197 --> 01:37:02,636
If you wish to hear the numbers again, say "Repeat numbers."

2168
01:37:03,667 --> 01:37:04,906
- Gosh. - What?

2169
01:37:04,907 --> 01:37:05,966
Cho A?

2170
01:37:06,207 --> 01:37:08,876
- Gosh, what? - He chose Cho A.

2171
01:37:08,877 --> 01:37:10,975
- What's going on? - Jae Hyung chose Cho A.

2172
01:37:10,976 --> 01:37:12,545
If someone's chosen,

2173
01:37:12,546 --> 01:37:13,645
does that mean she's not available anymore?

2174
01:37:13,646 --> 01:37:16,777
Or if she's chosen multiple times, does Cho A decide?

2175
01:37:17,747 --> 01:37:19,027
They said, "Watch and find out."

2176
01:37:24,287 --> 01:37:25,386
They always do this.

2177
01:37:27,296 --> 01:37:29,957
Why do you want to go on a date with that person?

2178
01:37:33,667 --> 01:37:36,497
I haven't had the chance to talk to her a lot,

2179
01:37:36,796 --> 01:37:38,337
so I want to talk to her.

2180
01:37:39,936 --> 01:37:41,877
I'm cheering for your date.

2181
01:37:42,136 --> 01:37:44,846
You may hang up now and return to your seat.

2182
01:37:47,046 --> 01:37:48,046
Did you talk?

2183
01:37:48,247 --> 01:37:50,317
- Gosh. - I think...

2184
01:37:52,016 --> 01:37:55,186
I wanted to talk to Cho A more.

2185
01:37:55,356 --> 01:37:57,215
Cho A is so busy,

2186
01:37:57,216 --> 01:37:59,526
and we really haven't talked much.

2187
01:37:59,527 --> 01:38:02,396
So I really wanted a chance to talk to her.

2188
01:38:02,596 --> 01:38:05,697
And I thought I'd feel comfortable going on a trip with her.

2189
01:38:05,867 --> 01:38:08,965
But if I went on an overnight trip with Ji Won,

2190
01:38:08,966 --> 01:38:11,207
I thought I'd feel slightly uncomfortable.

2191
01:38:11,407 --> 01:38:12,536
Should I call?

2192
01:38:12,537 --> 01:38:13,782
- Sure. Go ahead. - Go ahead and call.

2193
01:38:13,806 --> 01:38:14,836
- Go ahead. - Anyone...

2194
01:38:14,837 --> 01:38:17,746
who hasn't called yet can do it comfortably.

2195
01:38:17,747 --> 01:38:19,646
(The second person to make a call, Yong Woo)

2196
01:38:25,016 --> 01:38:27,116
But won't we be able to hear him?

2197
01:38:27,117 --> 01:38:29,286
None of us heard Jae Hyung's voice, though.

2198
01:38:29,287 --> 01:38:31,256
- Right, I didn't hear him. - But it's over now.

2199
01:38:37,367 --> 01:38:39,366
(The person Yong Woo can go on a date with is Se Seung...)

2200
01:38:39,367 --> 01:38:42,047
(The person Yong Woo can go on a date with is Se Seung and Yun Ha.)

2201
01:38:44,466 --> 01:38:47,266
Press the number of the person you want to go on a date with.

2202
01:38:47,577 --> 01:38:50,105
One, Se Seung. Two, Cho A. Three, Ju Yeon.

2203
01:38:50,106 --> 01:38:52,207
Four, Yun Ha. Five, Ji Won.

2204
01:38:52,506 --> 01:38:55,976
If you wish to hear the numbers again, say "Repeat numbers."

2205
01:38:57,016 --> 01:38:59,747
Why do you want to go on a date with that person?

2206
01:39:02,487 --> 01:39:03,516
Because I haven't.

2207
01:39:04,556 --> 01:39:06,355
- Did you think before you called? - Yes.

2208
01:39:06,356 --> 01:39:08,055
Did you think Se Seung was the only one you could choose?

2209
01:39:08,056 --> 01:39:09,126
Yes.

2210
01:39:09,127 --> 01:39:11,626
I thought, "Well, there's only one."

2211
01:39:11,627 --> 01:39:13,866
"This is too easy for me."

2212
01:39:13,867 --> 01:39:15,187
"I don't have to think about it."

2213
01:39:15,936 --> 01:39:18,136
- I see. - Oh, no.

2214
01:39:18,466 --> 01:39:20,036
Yong Woo mistakenly thinks...

2215
01:39:20,037 --> 01:39:22,776
Yun Ha is his Ring-ring Date, right now.

2216
01:39:22,777 --> 01:39:24,247
So then he can only choose...

2217
01:39:24,947 --> 01:39:27,777
is Se Seung, which is why he chose her.

2218
01:39:32,846 --> 01:39:34,886
I'm cheering for your date.

2219
01:39:35,157 --> 01:39:37,826
You may hang up now and return to your seat.

2220
01:39:37,827 --> 01:39:38,886
Okay.

2221
01:39:41,027 --> 01:39:42,056
Did something happen?

2222
01:39:42,657 --> 01:39:43,725
Did you understand?

2223
01:39:43,726 --> 01:39:44,795
- Me? - Yes.

2224
01:39:44,796 --> 01:39:46,466
I just went with the flow.

2225
01:39:46,796 --> 01:39:50,936
If Yong Woo had to exclude anyone from his previous dates,

2226
01:39:51,136 --> 01:39:54,036
I thought he'd choose to go on a date with Se Seung.

2227
01:39:54,037 --> 01:39:56,105
When Yong Woo makes a joke,

2228
01:39:56,106 --> 01:39:58,305
Se Seung reacts well.

2229
01:39:58,306 --> 01:40:01,645
And Se Seung brightens the mood too.

2230
01:40:01,646 --> 01:40:02,675
- Right. - So...

2231
01:40:02,676 --> 01:40:04,396
(The third person to make a call, Jung Sub)

2232
01:40:08,587 --> 01:40:10,656
Everyone was gathered in the first floor,

2233
01:40:10,657 --> 01:40:13,225
and I had to call from the phone right next them.

2234
01:40:13,226 --> 01:40:15,156
I thought they'd be able to know.

2235
01:40:15,157 --> 01:40:16,657
(He cautiously makes the call.)

2236
01:40:20,567 --> 01:40:23,337
Press the number of the person you want to go on a date with.

2237
01:40:23,697 --> 01:40:26,135
One, Se Seung. Two, Cho A. Three, Ju Yeon.

2238
01:40:26,136 --> 01:40:28,206
Four, Yun Ha. Five, Ji Won.

2239
01:40:28,207 --> 01:40:31,676
If you wish to hear the numbers again, say "Repeat numbers."

2240
01:40:31,747 --> 01:40:34,376
(The person Jung Sub can go on a date with is Cho A...)

2241
01:40:34,377 --> 01:40:36,816
(The person Jung Sub can go on a date with is Cho A, Ji Won...)

2242
01:40:36,817 --> 01:40:38,617
(Cho A, Ji Won, and Ju Yeon)

2243
01:40:43,317 --> 01:40:45,027
I wash my hair but...

2244
01:40:45,226 --> 01:40:47,287
I mean, that's what I think.

2245
01:40:47,596 --> 01:40:49,926
That's just what I think.

2246
01:40:50,197 --> 01:40:52,327
I think it's right, though.

2247
01:40:52,827 --> 01:40:55,167
(He chose number 2, Cho A.)

2248
01:40:57,537 --> 01:40:58,737
He made his decision.

2249
01:40:58,936 --> 01:41:01,306
Jung Sub was given the opportunity.

2250
01:41:01,777 --> 01:41:02,836
- Gosh. - Right.

2251
01:41:02,837 --> 01:41:05,206
Cho A's not even around the house often,

2252
01:41:05,207 --> 01:41:07,776
but she still got chosen a lot.

2253
01:41:07,777 --> 01:41:09,476
She must be very charming.

2254
01:41:10,046 --> 01:41:12,686
Why do you want to go on a date with that person?

2255
01:41:16,817 --> 01:41:19,256
I've been wanting to talk to her...

2256
01:41:19,426 --> 01:41:20,997
and get to know her.

2257
01:41:22,527 --> 01:41:23,596
I was...

2258
01:41:25,167 --> 01:41:26,226
barely conflicted.

2259
01:41:26,926 --> 01:41:30,135
Cho A seemed nice from the beginning,

2260
01:41:30,136 --> 01:41:31,436
so I wanted to get to know her.

2261
01:41:31,567 --> 01:41:35,435
And she's someone I'd feel comfortable travelling with.

2262
01:41:35,436 --> 01:41:37,676
That's why I chose Cho A.

2263
01:41:38,877 --> 01:41:41,476
(Jae Hyung made the same choice.)

2264
01:41:42,377 --> 01:41:44,247
I'm cheering for your date.

2265
01:41:44,716 --> 01:41:47,185
You may hang up now and return to your seat.

2266
01:41:47,186 --> 01:41:48,256
Yes, thank you.

2267
01:41:51,056 --> 01:41:52,056
I did it.

2268
01:41:54,186 --> 01:41:56,425
This place is tough.

2269
01:41:56,426 --> 01:42:00,226
I don't think how I feel will change a lot.

2270
01:42:00,466 --> 01:42:04,095
But it's not like I can control how someone else feels.

2271
01:42:04,096 --> 01:42:06,167
So I think his feelings can change.

2272
01:42:06,337 --> 01:42:08,975
When Jung Sub's feelings head toward someone else,

2273
01:42:08,976 --> 01:42:11,176
regardless of who it is,

2274
01:42:11,346 --> 01:42:13,806
I don't know how I'd be able to stand it.

2275
01:42:14,377 --> 01:42:17,015
I think there will be a lot of changes.

2276
01:42:17,016 --> 01:42:18,987
My feelings have gotten so big,

2277
01:42:19,417 --> 01:42:22,117
so I'm nervous about that.

2278
01:42:24,587 --> 01:42:27,055
Se Seung's reaction at the time,

2279
01:42:27,056 --> 01:42:31,527
her facial expression, didn't seem good.

2280
01:42:32,327 --> 01:42:35,997
Honestly, this is a chance for Se Seung to get to know others too.

2281
01:42:36,237 --> 01:42:38,606
That's what this is about.

2282
01:42:38,907 --> 01:42:40,805
Seeing how we had to exclude people from...

2283
01:42:40,806 --> 01:42:42,475
our previous dates and choose,

2284
01:42:42,476 --> 01:42:44,675
it felt like it was about not going on dates...

2285
01:42:44,676 --> 01:42:47,777
with the same person and getting to know other people.

2286
01:42:49,817 --> 01:42:53,886
Gosh, their feelings about this are completely different.

2287
01:42:54,247 --> 01:42:57,055
One of them is totally in love, but look at this.

2288
01:42:57,056 --> 01:42:58,726
She can get to know other people too.

2289
01:42:59,027 --> 01:43:00,997
This is so fun. You got this.

2290
01:43:01,027 --> 01:43:03,657
(The next person to make a call, Cheol Hyeon)

2291
01:43:09,237 --> 01:43:11,336
(The person Jung Sub can go on a date with is Se Seung...)

2292
01:43:11,337 --> 01:43:14,017
(The person Jung Sub can go on a date with is Se Seung and Ji Won.)

2293
01:43:16,537 --> 01:43:19,246
Press the number of the person you want to go on a date with.

2294
01:43:19,247 --> 01:43:21,816
One, Se Seung. Two, Cho A. Three, Ju Yeon.

2295
01:43:21,817 --> 01:43:23,846
Four, Yun Ha. Five, Ji Won.

2296
01:43:24,176 --> 01:43:27,617
If you wish to hear the numbers again, say "Repeat numbers."

2297
01:43:29,016 --> 01:43:30,056
Repeat numbers.

2298
01:43:30,886 --> 01:43:32,255
(Repeat numbers so we can all hear.)

2299
01:43:32,256 --> 01:43:33,886
(He was too loud.)

2300
01:43:36,226 --> 01:43:38,827
I should have done that first.

2301
01:43:39,567 --> 01:43:43,636
Meanwhile, he has the most serious expression on his face.

2302
01:43:44,567 --> 01:43:46,737
(He's very serious.)

2303
01:43:48,136 --> 01:43:49,176
"Repeat numbers."

2304
01:43:49,976 --> 01:43:51,006
"Repeat numbers."

2305
01:43:51,277 --> 01:43:53,746
One, Se Seung. Two, Cho A. Three, Ju Yeon.

2306
01:43:53,747 --> 01:43:55,747
Four, Yun Ha. Five, Ji Won.

2307
01:43:57,546 --> 01:43:59,385
(He chose number five, Ji Won.)

2308
01:43:59,386 --> 01:44:02,087
Why do you want to go on a date with that person?

2309
01:44:07,657 --> 01:44:10,356
Why do you want to go on a date with that person?

2310
01:44:14,766 --> 01:44:17,396
Why do you want to go on a date with that person?

2311
01:44:19,136 --> 01:44:22,936
I think her lifestyles and interests...

2312
01:44:23,136 --> 01:44:25,077
would be similar to mine?

2313
01:44:28,117 --> 01:44:30,046
I'm cheering for your date.

2314
01:44:30,346 --> 01:44:32,917
You may hang up now and return to your seat.

2315
01:44:33,346 --> 01:44:34,386
Okay.

2316
01:44:36,386 --> 01:44:37,386
Gosh.

2317
01:44:38,027 --> 01:44:39,287
- Did you do it? - Yes, I did.

2318
01:44:39,726 --> 01:44:42,626
I think Cheol Hyeon would have chosen Ji Won.

2319
01:44:42,627 --> 01:44:44,156
It seemed like he was sending her signals.

2320
01:44:44,157 --> 01:44:46,925
"I want to tell her. I want to talk to her."

2321
01:44:46,926 --> 01:44:49,737
I saw that he was trying to start a conversation with her.

2322
01:44:49,837 --> 01:44:52,337
Isn't this very interesting?

2323
01:44:53,207 --> 01:44:54,407
It's really cool.

2324
01:44:55,907 --> 01:44:58,345
I finally heard Jae Hyung sing.

2325
01:44:58,346 --> 01:45:00,975
- Gosh. - Gosh, really? I'm so jealous.

2326
01:45:00,976 --> 01:45:02,276
Yes.

2327
01:45:02,277 --> 01:45:04,247
- How was he? - How was he? Was he good?

2328
01:45:04,447 --> 01:45:06,685
I think he's the best singer out of everyone I know.

2329
01:45:06,686 --> 01:45:07,956
- Gosh, really? - Gosh.

2330
01:45:07,957 --> 01:45:10,586
Even though he caught a cold...

2331
01:45:10,587 --> 01:45:13,826
so his voice sounded nasally, he kept hitting all the high notes.

2332
01:45:13,827 --> 01:45:15,697
(He's on the 2nd floor.)

2333
01:45:16,926 --> 01:45:18,866
I heard the speakers tear.

2334
01:45:18,867 --> 01:45:19,867
Gosh.

2335
01:45:20,926 --> 01:45:23,696
Don't you think Jae Hyung has a nice voice?

2336
01:45:23,697 --> 01:45:25,566
- Right. - He does have a loud voice.

2337
01:45:25,567 --> 01:45:27,207
We have to make him sing.

2338
01:45:31,037 --> 01:45:33,346
(Cho A is alone on the 2nd floor.)

2339
01:45:35,676 --> 01:45:41,157
- Please don't leave me again - Don't leave me again

2340
01:45:41,587 --> 01:45:43,147
- In the future, I want - In the future

2341
01:45:48,997 --> 01:45:50,027
Are you not hungry?

2342
01:45:50,426 --> 01:45:52,295
- I am. - Really?

2343
01:45:52,296 --> 01:45:54,196
Is the pecan pie gone?

2344
01:45:54,197 --> 01:45:55,796
Do you want to go and share some?

2345
01:45:56,237 --> 01:45:57,465
Should we? But...

2346
01:45:57,466 --> 01:45:58,965
You're worried about eating at night, right?

2347
01:45:58,966 --> 01:46:00,305
Do you want to just have a drink then?

2348
01:46:00,306 --> 01:46:02,605
- I think that's better. - Yes, sounds good.

2349
01:46:02,606 --> 01:46:04,237
- Right? - Yes. Let's have a drink.

2350
01:46:08,516 --> 01:46:10,016
What's your schedule like tomorrow?

2351
01:46:10,216 --> 01:46:13,117
I have to do some work when I wake up.

2352
01:46:14,287 --> 01:46:16,885
Other people are anxiously waiting for my review.

2353
01:46:16,886 --> 01:46:18,726
I have to write it up and send it to them.

2354
01:46:20,726 --> 01:46:22,725
Gosh, you're busy.

2355
01:46:22,726 --> 01:46:25,166
(He takes a seat when he can have a good look at his sister.)

2356
01:46:28,537 --> 01:46:30,966
- Cheers. - Cheers.

2357
01:46:39,277 --> 01:46:42,215
- Gosh, leave. - He took a seat.

2358
01:46:42,216 --> 01:46:43,546
Go away.

2359
01:46:43,947 --> 01:46:45,616
- Why is he doing that? - Gosh, Cheol Hyeon.

2360
01:46:45,617 --> 01:46:47,317
He can't keep a poker face.

2361
01:46:49,287 --> 01:46:51,627
- Oh, no. - Gosh.

2362
01:46:51,827 --> 01:46:53,986
From Jung Sub's perspective,

2363
01:46:53,987 --> 01:46:56,126
- Cheol Hyeon is like a ghost. - Why?

2364
01:46:56,127 --> 01:46:57,872
- He's always there. - He's always next to him.

2365
01:46:57,896 --> 01:46:59,697
Whatever he does, Cheol Hyeon follows him.

2366
01:47:00,296 --> 01:47:01,765
- He's always around. - At this rate,

2367
01:47:01,766 --> 01:47:03,646
Jung Sub might think, "Is it me that he likes?"

2368
01:47:05,167 --> 01:47:07,167
"Is it something about me?"

2369
01:47:12,077 --> 01:47:14,676
(Comfortable)

2370
01:47:25,256 --> 01:47:29,157
I honestly didn't go there in order to disturb them.

2371
01:47:30,027 --> 01:47:31,966
When my sister first came here,

2372
01:47:32,327 --> 01:47:33,697
she didn't talk much.

2373
01:47:33,867 --> 01:47:36,836
So I was determined to help her...

2374
01:47:36,837 --> 01:47:38,306
socialize.

2375
01:47:38,567 --> 01:47:41,337
He isn't the type to give me space.

2376
01:47:43,537 --> 01:47:44,846
Maybe I failed to read the room.

2377
01:47:45,646 --> 01:47:47,447
That could be the case.

2378
01:47:47,747 --> 01:47:50,117
(In the end, the three of them hang out.)

2379
01:47:50,676 --> 01:47:51,986
I want to exercise.

2380
01:47:51,987 --> 01:47:54,117
- Seriously. I was busy with work. - Same here.

2381
01:47:54,317 --> 01:47:55,457
Seriously,

2382
01:47:56,216 --> 01:47:57,856
do you want to go to a gym with me?

2383
01:47:58,127 --> 01:47:59,256
A gym?

2384
01:47:59,686 --> 01:48:01,395
What kind of exercise do you...

2385
01:48:01,396 --> 01:48:02,795
- I... - You do yoga, right?

2386
01:48:02,796 --> 01:48:04,996
I do yoga, but I enjoy working out at a gym too.

2387
01:48:04,997 --> 01:48:06,095
- Really? - Yes.

2388
01:48:06,096 --> 01:48:08,366
- Do you want to go for real? - I want to stretch my body.

2389
01:48:08,367 --> 01:48:09,466
Tomorrow.

2390
01:48:09,796 --> 01:48:11,936
I want to take a stroll tomorrow.

2391
01:48:12,037 --> 01:48:13,037
Take a stroll?

2392
01:48:13,606 --> 01:48:16,105
If going to a gym is too much,

2393
01:48:16,106 --> 01:48:17,406
we can go to the Montmartre Park.

2394
01:48:17,407 --> 01:48:19,376
Are there ways to work out?

2395
01:48:19,377 --> 01:48:20,645
- What? - Exercise machines.

2396
01:48:20,646 --> 01:48:21,676
Yes, there are.

2397
01:48:22,417 --> 01:48:23,776
Do you want to go to the Montmartre Park?

2398
01:48:23,777 --> 01:48:25,247
I would love that.

2399
01:48:25,346 --> 01:48:27,216
I had a lengthy conversation with Cho A.

2400
01:48:27,386 --> 01:48:29,856
She listened to me well.

2401
01:48:30,216 --> 01:48:31,827
I think she likes to joke around too.

2402
01:48:32,327 --> 01:48:36,256
She does it with a gentle demeanour.

2403
01:48:36,426 --> 01:48:37,926
It's funny.

2404
01:48:38,027 --> 01:48:40,327
It made me keep watching her.

2405
01:48:41,837 --> 01:48:43,537
It was like that.

2406
01:48:46,567 --> 01:48:47,666
I don't need it.

2407
01:48:47,667 --> 01:48:48,906
(Se Seung, Ju Yeon, and Ji Won's room)

2408
01:48:48,907 --> 01:48:49,907
In that case,

2409
01:48:51,377 --> 01:48:52,447
I choose a song by Yada.

2410
01:48:54,247 --> 01:48:55,247
Okay.

2411
01:48:55,817 --> 01:48:57,316
- Talk. - I am talking.

2412
01:48:57,317 --> 01:48:58,677
- Are you talking? - I am talking.

2413
01:48:59,117 --> 01:49:00,446
- I am talking. - Are you making a sound?

2414
01:49:00,447 --> 01:49:01,556
I am making a sound.

2415
01:49:02,556 --> 01:49:03,556
How cute.

2416
01:49:10,657 --> 01:49:12,226
I don't think this is it.

2417
01:49:12,867 --> 01:49:19,237
(She stares at the messages for a long while.)

2418
01:49:24,337 --> 01:49:27,846
(Ji Won becomes thoughtful.)

2419
01:49:42,256 --> 01:49:44,657
(She tosses and turns...)

2420
01:49:46,027 --> 01:49:49,766
(before falling asleep next to Hot Pink.)

2421
01:49:52,266 --> 01:49:58,377
(It was an imperfect day.)

2422
01:50:04,787 --> 01:50:06,386
Gosh, Ji Won.

2423
01:50:06,646 --> 01:50:08,156
- Oh, no. - My heart aches.

2424
01:50:08,157 --> 01:50:09,515
It's so heartbreaking.

2425
01:50:09,516 --> 01:50:11,755
- I know. - When something like that happens,

2426
01:50:11,756 --> 01:50:15,095
you can't help but wonder, "What did I do wrong?"

2427
01:50:15,096 --> 01:50:17,396
You go over everything that happened in a day.

2428
01:50:17,627 --> 01:50:18,996
- "What did I say..." - That's right.

2429
01:50:18,997 --> 01:50:20,067
"that he didn't like?"

2430
01:50:20,296 --> 01:50:21,997
I hope she won't lose confidence.

2431
01:50:22,197 --> 01:50:23,966
Throw away Hot Pink.

2432
01:50:25,367 --> 01:50:26,906
- I know. It's meaningless. - Hot Pink, my foot.

2433
01:50:26,907 --> 01:50:28,777
Why did he bring the dolphin?

2434
01:50:29,136 --> 01:50:30,305
Why did he name it?

2435
01:50:30,306 --> 01:50:32,226
- That's what I am saying. - For goodness' sake.

2436
01:50:35,117 --> 01:50:37,476
(Next morning)

2437
01:50:38,386 --> 01:50:40,646
(Yun Ha is going on a business trip to the provinces.)

2438
01:50:42,787 --> 01:50:45,056
(She heads out hurriedly.)

2439
01:50:46,527 --> 01:50:49,157
(Yun Ha goes to work.)

2440
01:50:50,226 --> 01:50:51,697
Shall we look at the photo albums?

2441
01:50:54,167 --> 01:50:56,647
(They take out the photo albums they went over four days ago.)

2442
01:50:57,997 --> 01:50:59,407
- Is this Yong Woo? - Yes.

2443
01:51:00,737 --> 01:51:02,237
The best strawberry prince.

2444
01:51:02,837 --> 01:51:03,907
How cute.

2445
01:51:05,006 --> 01:51:06,846
He could sing well since then.

2446
01:51:09,247 --> 01:51:10,376
Let me read this.

2447
01:51:10,377 --> 01:51:12,386
(She spots Jae Hyung's Sibling Introduction.)

2448
01:51:13,287 --> 01:51:14,716
(What?)

2449
01:51:17,457 --> 01:51:19,086
That was when...

2450
01:51:19,087 --> 01:51:21,256
I read Jae Hyung's Sibling Introduction.

2451
01:51:21,556 --> 01:51:25,827
It was completely different from what I assumed of Jae Hyung...

2452
01:51:26,096 --> 01:51:28,497
by talking to him for ten minutes.

2453
01:51:28,667 --> 01:51:30,996
(What was Jae Hyung's first impression?)

2454
01:51:30,997 --> 01:51:32,837
I bet he went to the internet café often.

2455
01:51:33,167 --> 01:51:35,475
I bet he often ordered...

2456
01:51:35,476 --> 01:51:38,806
the unhealthy rice bowls there.

2457
01:51:44,247 --> 01:51:45,247
Really?

2458
01:51:45,447 --> 01:51:47,046
He looks mischievous.

2459
01:51:47,747 --> 01:51:51,215
He seemed like the youngest child.

2460
01:51:51,216 --> 01:51:53,355
I thought he was someone...

2461
01:51:53,356 --> 01:51:56,096
who would get looked after by other people,

2462
01:51:56,226 --> 01:51:58,326
not the other way around.

2463
01:51:58,327 --> 01:52:02,596
But the Sibling Introduction painted him as a different person.

2464
01:52:03,037 --> 01:52:04,295
Every part was like that.

2465
01:52:04,296 --> 01:52:07,606
It was completely different from what I had imagined.

2466
01:52:08,837 --> 01:52:10,377
Isn't it so unexpected?

2467
01:52:11,907 --> 01:52:15,447
As I was reading it, I kept going, "What?"

2468
01:52:16,176 --> 01:52:18,986
You usually see such photo albums...

2469
01:52:18,987 --> 01:52:20,715
after a long time.

2470
01:52:20,716 --> 01:52:21,956
You usually see them after you become very close...

2471
01:52:21,957 --> 01:52:23,855
- or begin dating. - That's right.

2472
01:52:23,856 --> 01:52:26,026
But on this show, they begin by looking at the photo albums.

2473
01:52:26,027 --> 01:52:27,126
- That's right. - Those photo albums...

2474
01:52:27,127 --> 01:52:29,196
have a big influence.

2475
01:52:29,197 --> 01:52:31,326
It might make someone seem unfamiliar.

2476
01:52:31,327 --> 01:52:33,202
What she read was different from her first impression.

2477
01:52:33,226 --> 01:52:35,667
She will begin seeing him in a new light.

2478
01:52:37,966 --> 01:52:39,237
I see.

2479
01:52:40,567 --> 01:52:41,777
What are you doing, man?

2480
01:52:42,237 --> 01:52:43,337
Working at home.

2481
01:52:45,006 --> 01:52:46,966
That will make her stick to the first impression.

2482
01:52:47,777 --> 01:52:50,137
- Back to her original ideas? - It happened in two seconds.

2483
01:52:50,777 --> 01:52:53,487
- What are you doing, man? - Working at home.

2484
01:52:53,886 --> 01:52:55,515
(Mr. Plot Twist enters.)

2485
01:52:55,516 --> 01:52:57,317
- Hello. - Hello.

2486
01:52:58,756 --> 01:53:00,386
Ji Won, did you take a lot of photos?

2487
01:53:00,787 --> 01:53:02,426
- Photos? - Shall I take a photo of you?

2488
01:53:02,957 --> 01:53:04,827
- Sure? - Both of you are in the frame.

2489
01:53:07,396 --> 01:53:09,396
One, two, three.

2490
01:53:15,277 --> 01:53:16,506
Shall I take a photo of you?

2491
01:53:16,737 --> 01:53:17,737
- Me? - Yes.

2492
01:53:17,738 --> 01:53:19,978
- After I am less bloated. - After you are less bloated?

2493
01:53:21,976 --> 01:53:23,136
That yellow is really bright.

2494
01:53:23,417 --> 01:53:25,747
(Who do you think is Jae Hyung's sibling?)

2495
01:53:26,287 --> 01:53:28,587
I think Jae Hyung and Yun Ha are siblings.

2496
01:53:28,787 --> 01:53:31,587
They look similar when they smile.

2497
01:53:31,926 --> 01:53:33,855
They both have a bubbly side.

2498
01:53:33,856 --> 01:53:37,856
I think they have the same vibe because they are siblings.

2499
01:53:39,266 --> 01:53:41,095
Look at this. Doesn't it look nice?

2500
01:53:41,096 --> 01:53:42,697
(Cho A comes up to the 2nd floor.)

2501
01:53:43,337 --> 01:53:45,207
Today, I am going out on a date.

2502
01:53:46,136 --> 01:53:47,306
Have fun.

2503
01:53:47,667 --> 01:53:49,406
Do you...

2504
01:53:49,407 --> 01:53:51,135
(Her sibling seems to want to say something.)

2505
01:53:51,136 --> 01:53:53,207
- What is it? - Is no one else around?

2506
01:53:53,646 --> 01:53:54,646
- Here? - Yes.

2507
01:53:54,647 --> 01:53:55,877
On the second floor? Yes.

2508
01:53:56,447 --> 01:53:57,877
How do you like Jung Sub?

2509
01:53:58,447 --> 01:53:59,486
How do you like him?

2510
01:53:59,487 --> 01:54:00,516
- Jung Sub? - Yes.

2511
01:54:00,747 --> 01:54:02,417
I like Yong Woo more these days.

2512
01:54:04,917 --> 01:54:06,386
(Yong Woo appears.)

2513
01:54:08,697 --> 01:54:10,556
(They chuckle for no reason.)

2514
01:54:11,926 --> 01:54:14,895
(They continue to have a conversation cautiously.)

2515
01:54:14,896 --> 01:54:17,736
Cheol Hyeon, are you having a photo shoot?

2516
01:54:17,737 --> 01:54:18,867
Is that it?

2517
01:54:20,037 --> 01:54:21,265
It's like a sofa commercial.

2518
01:54:21,266 --> 01:54:22,536
(The Siblings' Room session ends.)

2519
01:54:22,537 --> 01:54:24,006
Yong Woo, sit here.

2520
01:54:25,277 --> 01:54:27,477
- I will take a nice photo of you. - That sounds great.

2521
01:54:27,947 --> 01:54:29,277
One, two, three.

2522
01:54:32,787 --> 01:54:34,516
- It's pretty. - Is it nice?

2523
01:54:34,787 --> 01:54:36,417
Why don't the two of you sit together?

2524
01:54:36,657 --> 01:54:38,356
The picture will be perfect.

2525
01:54:39,327 --> 01:54:41,086
- Brother-in-law. - Brother-in-law Hunter.

2526
01:54:41,087 --> 01:54:42,396
- Seriously. - Brother-in-law.

2527
01:54:42,497 --> 01:54:43,956
He is someone who shoots Cupid's arrows.

2528
01:54:43,957 --> 01:54:45,326
- Cho A, sit here. - Here.

2529
01:54:45,327 --> 01:54:47,226
- Okay. - Let me get the right angle.

2530
01:54:47,867 --> 01:54:50,167
I think it will be nice. I think it will be pretty.

2531
01:54:56,707 --> 01:55:00,346
(He succeeds in helping his sister.)

2532
01:55:06,016 --> 01:55:07,016
What?

2533
01:55:08,756 --> 01:55:11,587
(A letter arrives.)

2534
01:55:13,886 --> 01:55:16,026
- I will open it. - Okay.

2535
01:55:16,027 --> 01:55:17,027
That sounds great.

2536
01:55:20,997 --> 01:55:22,436
Hurry up and tell us.

2537
01:55:22,567 --> 01:55:24,666
"Secret Room has opened."

2538
01:55:24,667 --> 01:55:25,707
What?

2539
01:55:26,037 --> 01:55:27,167
Secret Room?

2540
01:55:28,106 --> 01:55:30,435
Secret Room? What's that?

2541
01:55:30,436 --> 01:55:32,476
"The sibling of the person..."

2542
01:55:33,176 --> 01:55:35,446
"who was chosen for a date..."

2543
01:55:35,447 --> 01:55:38,716
"will choose from the candidates through a conversation."

2544
01:55:39,016 --> 01:55:40,486
"Outside of the Secret Room,"

2545
01:55:40,487 --> 01:55:43,756
"you must not talk about the date."

2546
01:55:44,356 --> 01:55:47,756
If a woman gets chosen by multiple men, her sibling...

2547
01:55:48,327 --> 01:55:50,055
- will talk to them and go, - He will talk to them.

2548
01:55:50,056 --> 01:55:51,225
"I want this one..."

2549
01:55:51,226 --> 01:55:53,526
- "to be my sister's date." - "I want this one to be her date."

2550
01:55:53,527 --> 01:55:55,237
He will have a final say on her date.

2551
01:55:55,436 --> 01:55:57,866
- Right. - The sibling gets to decide.

2552
01:55:57,867 --> 01:56:01,636
This is the essence of My Sibling's Romance.

2553
01:56:01,806 --> 01:56:04,005
You should have also made a good impression on the sibling.

2554
01:56:04,006 --> 01:56:05,576
- You should have looked nice. - That's right.

2555
01:56:05,577 --> 01:56:06,577
That's right.

2556
01:56:06,578 --> 01:56:08,545
Now, Cheol Hyeon holds the key.

2557
01:56:08,546 --> 01:56:09,546
- Yes. - Yes.

2558
01:56:10,216 --> 01:56:13,747
Since I had told Cheol Hyeon whom I was interested in,

2559
01:56:13,987 --> 01:56:17,117
I thought he would choose that person.

2560
01:56:17,957 --> 01:56:19,677
I thought, "Does my sibling get to choose?"

2561
01:56:19,827 --> 01:56:23,497
I don't think he will choose the one I like.

2562
01:56:23,627 --> 01:56:27,425
I think he will focus on choosing someone who likes me...

2563
01:56:27,426 --> 01:56:30,497
or someone who has a nice personality.

2564
01:56:30,796 --> 01:56:31,806
I wasn't very trustful.

2565
01:56:33,806 --> 01:56:34,836
See you later.

2566
01:56:34,837 --> 01:56:35,906
- Okay. - We will be back.

2567
01:56:35,907 --> 01:56:37,005
Thank you.

2568
01:56:37,006 --> 01:56:39,646
(Amidst the confusion, men leave for the Secret Room.)

2569
01:56:41,146 --> 01:56:42,346
Is everyone wearing black?

2570
01:56:46,216 --> 01:56:50,657
(Secret Room)

2571
01:56:53,056 --> 01:56:57,197
(Two rooms are separated by a mirror.)

2572
01:56:58,127 --> 01:57:02,697
(If a woman got chosen as a date by multiple men yesterday, )

2573
01:57:03,997 --> 01:57:05,505
(her sibling will interview the candidates...)

2574
01:57:05,506 --> 01:57:06,936
(and decide on the final date.)

2575
01:57:07,337 --> 01:57:10,237
(The applicants will answer as they look at their reflections.)

2576
01:57:12,806 --> 01:57:17,277
(The applicants will hear the interviewer's altered voice.)

2577
01:57:18,646 --> 01:57:23,256
(The interviewer will hear the applicants' unaltered voices.)

2578
01:57:24,917 --> 01:57:29,426
(The interviewer can observe the applicants.)

2579
01:57:35,337 --> 01:57:38,067
(The applicant, Cheol Hyeon enters.)

2580
01:57:38,197 --> 01:57:41,237
(Here, he will decide on Cho A's date.)

2581
01:57:42,237 --> 01:57:44,336
(Jae Hyung and Jung Sub applied...)

2582
01:57:44,337 --> 01:57:47,207
(for a date with Cho A.)

2583
01:57:48,277 --> 01:57:49,616
To find my brother-in-law,

2584
01:57:49,617 --> 01:57:51,845
I will become a judge...

2585
01:57:51,846 --> 01:57:53,816
and find the best candidate.

2586
01:57:53,817 --> 01:57:56,616
With the determination to find the number one candidate,

2587
01:57:56,617 --> 01:57:59,157
I will observe with the eyes of a hawk.

2588
01:57:59,426 --> 01:58:01,056
It's like a blind interview.

2589
01:58:01,587 --> 01:58:03,426
It's an actual interview.

2590
01:58:03,827 --> 01:58:06,126
How did Cheol Hyeon become the interviewer?

2591
01:58:06,127 --> 01:58:07,996
I think Cheol Hyeon is enjoying this time the most.

2592
01:58:07,997 --> 01:58:09,635
- I know. - "I applied to this show..."

2593
01:58:09,636 --> 01:58:11,465
"for this moment."

2594
01:58:11,466 --> 01:58:13,026
The interviewer for the brother-in-law.

2595
01:58:13,567 --> 01:58:17,337
(The first applicant, Jae Hyung enters.)

2596
01:58:34,587 --> 01:58:36,527
I felt like I was being observed.

2597
01:58:37,827 --> 01:58:40,367
I could only see my face,

2598
01:58:40,527 --> 01:58:43,466
but I felt like I was being observed from the other side.

2599
01:58:44,067 --> 01:58:45,766
It was a bit nerve-racking.

2600
01:58:51,577 --> 01:58:53,907
Jae Hyung was the one who entered first.

2601
01:58:54,146 --> 01:58:57,545
He wasn't someone I had expected to see.

2602
01:58:57,546 --> 01:59:00,447
"Why did Jae Hyung choose my sister?"

2603
01:59:00,917 --> 01:59:02,317
"Didn't he have any options?"

2604
01:59:02,856 --> 01:59:05,216
"Was my sister the only one he could choose?"

2605
01:59:05,627 --> 01:59:09,356
In any case, I thought it was very unexpected.

2606
01:59:09,926 --> 01:59:11,096
Hello, Jae Hyung.

2607
01:59:11,596 --> 01:59:12,726
Hello, Jae Hyung.

2608
01:59:13,667 --> 01:59:14,766
Hello.

2609
01:59:15,296 --> 01:59:17,697
- Jae Hyung, did you sleep well? - I slept well.

2610
01:59:17,867 --> 01:59:19,266
Did you have a good meal?

2611
01:59:19,367 --> 01:59:21,765
- I had a good meal. - I see.

2612
01:59:21,766 --> 01:59:24,036
Are you cold on the outside and warm on the inside?

2613
01:59:24,037 --> 01:59:28,406
I don't think I am very affectionate and sweet.

2614
01:59:28,407 --> 01:59:31,416
But if it's someone I like such as my girlfriend,

2615
01:59:31,417 --> 01:59:35,247
I tell her that she is pretty and cute.

2616
01:59:35,386 --> 01:59:36,487
That's right.

2617
01:59:37,617 --> 01:59:38,756
Is that right?

2618
01:59:38,856 --> 01:59:40,755
I think you are...

2619
01:59:40,756 --> 01:59:42,296
a charming person like that.

2620
01:59:42,596 --> 01:59:45,766
I think that's your charm.

2621
01:59:45,867 --> 01:59:47,367
Is that so? Thank you.

2622
01:59:47,867 --> 01:59:50,435
I decided to put him at ease.

2623
01:59:50,436 --> 01:59:52,135
A rigid atmosphere...

2624
01:59:52,136 --> 01:59:55,036
wouldn't have helped in hearing his honest thoughts.

2625
01:59:55,037 --> 01:59:56,537
What's your ideal type?

2626
01:59:57,006 --> 02:00:00,806
I have always liked a kind woman who looks after me...

2627
02:00:01,106 --> 02:00:05,146
and is similar to me.

2628
02:00:05,487 --> 02:00:08,345
Jae Hyung, I think we have many similarities.

2629
02:00:08,346 --> 02:00:10,587
I see. Are you the same?

2630
02:00:12,556 --> 02:00:13,627
I don't know.

2631
02:00:13,756 --> 02:00:15,527
You said we had many similarities.

2632
02:00:17,296 --> 02:00:18,595
When you are in a relationship,

2633
02:00:18,596 --> 02:00:20,396
do you spend a lot of time with your friends?

2634
02:00:20,466 --> 02:00:21,466
Do you have a lot of friends?

2635
02:00:21,467 --> 02:00:25,166
When I am in a relationship, it becomes my priority.

2636
02:00:25,167 --> 02:00:27,106
I think I spend...

2637
02:00:27,337 --> 02:00:30,605
more time with my girlfriend compared to my friends.

2638
02:00:30,606 --> 02:00:32,506
My priority changes.

2639
02:00:33,476 --> 02:00:35,976
Is Cho A your first choice right now?

2640
02:00:37,016 --> 02:00:38,747
- In the house? - Yes.

2641
02:00:40,716 --> 02:00:42,256
She isn't my first choice.

2642
02:00:45,487 --> 02:00:48,287
I listened to your answers...

2643
02:00:48,726 --> 02:00:52,627
and understood them well. You gave great answers. Thank you.

2644
02:00:52,697 --> 02:00:53,896
Thank you.

2645
02:00:53,997 --> 02:00:55,326
- Bye. - Bye.

2646
02:00:55,327 --> 02:00:56,596
Bye.

2647
02:00:57,537 --> 02:00:59,366
While Jae Hyung is a great man,

2648
02:00:59,367 --> 02:01:04,536
I am not sure if he and my sister would be a good fit.

2649
02:01:04,537 --> 02:01:08,207
I didn't have any strong emotions.

2650
02:01:10,577 --> 02:01:13,617
(The next applicant, Jung Sub enters.)

2651
02:01:14,546 --> 02:01:16,986
When Jung Sub entered,

2652
02:01:16,987 --> 02:01:20,186
I was a bit more fastidious.

2653
02:01:25,596 --> 02:01:29,435
I tried to study Jung Sub's behaviours and gestures...

2654
02:01:29,436 --> 02:01:31,837
and look into his eyes more.

2655
02:01:36,676 --> 02:01:37,837
Jung Sub, hello.

2656
02:01:40,277 --> 02:01:41,346
Hello.

2657
02:01:41,546 --> 02:01:43,675
Let's talk about Cho A.

2658
02:01:43,676 --> 02:01:46,986
There is something I want to know about Cho A.

2659
02:01:46,987 --> 02:01:49,016
What kind of a man does she like?

2660
02:01:49,686 --> 02:01:52,087
I see. You are asking me a question.

2661
02:01:52,957 --> 02:01:55,795
Jung Sub left a strong impression.

2662
02:01:55,796 --> 02:01:58,226
I thought I was the one who was asking questions,

2663
02:01:58,426 --> 02:02:00,465
but he asked me questions instead.

2664
02:02:00,466 --> 02:02:04,037
Does she like someone kind? Does she like someone funny?

2665
02:02:04,237 --> 02:02:05,636
I hope you can tell me.

2666
02:02:06,067 --> 02:02:08,636
I think she likes someone affectionate.

2667
02:02:09,636 --> 02:02:10,707
But...

2668
02:02:11,006 --> 02:02:12,777
you shouldn't be overly affectionate.

2669
02:02:13,377 --> 02:02:14,476
Also,

2670
02:02:14,747 --> 02:02:17,377
the tone of the words is very important to her.

2671
02:02:17,476 --> 02:02:18,846
The tone of the words?

2672
02:02:18,987 --> 02:02:22,185
She likes someone who speaks prettily,

2673
02:02:22,186 --> 02:02:24,685
compared to someone who speaks in a straightforward way.

2674
02:02:24,686 --> 02:02:26,686
I think that's very important.

2675
02:02:27,027 --> 02:02:29,225
One answer was the most memorable.

2676
02:02:29,226 --> 02:02:33,225
Cho A likes someone who speaks prettily.

2677
02:02:33,226 --> 02:02:36,836
That sentence suits Cho A so well.

2678
02:02:36,837 --> 02:02:37,867
That very sentence.

2679
02:02:38,197 --> 02:02:40,406
Cho A is someone who makes an effort...

2680
02:02:40,407 --> 02:02:41,706
to deliver her words gently.

2681
02:02:41,707 --> 02:02:46,005
I think that's who she really is.

2682
02:02:46,006 --> 02:02:48,746
Cho A would appreciate...

2683
02:02:48,747 --> 02:02:52,516
the effort to do the same.

2684
02:02:52,947 --> 02:02:56,457
Jung Sub, we are going on a two-day date to Gangwon Province.

2685
02:02:56,556 --> 02:02:58,685
- Yes. - What do you want to do...

2686
02:02:58,686 --> 02:02:59,763
when you go on a date with Cho A?

2687
02:02:59,787 --> 02:03:02,256
I was going to ask you...

2688
02:03:03,127 --> 02:03:04,497
about that.

2689
02:03:04,827 --> 02:03:07,826
To be honest, I made a list of questions.

2690
02:03:07,827 --> 02:03:10,135
Among the older age, same age, and younger age, what does she like?

2691
02:03:10,136 --> 02:03:11,736
What kind of a man does she like?

2692
02:03:11,737 --> 02:03:12,935
What kind of a man does she dislike?

2693
02:03:12,936 --> 02:03:13,936
What kind of a personality does she like?

2694
02:03:13,937 --> 02:03:15,366
Does she like someone who is affectionate or fun?

2695
02:03:15,367 --> 02:03:17,935
Does she like someone who is loud? What kind of a date does she like?

2696
02:03:17,936 --> 02:03:19,605
Does she prefer going to an amusement park...

2697
02:03:19,606 --> 02:03:21,505
or having a conversation at a café?

2698
02:03:21,506 --> 02:03:22,776
Does she like going to a place with a nice vibe?

2699
02:03:22,777 --> 02:03:23,777
What kind of a present does she like?

2700
02:03:23,778 --> 02:03:26,346
I wanted to ask those questions.

2701
02:03:28,016 --> 02:03:29,055
How nice.

2702
02:03:29,056 --> 02:03:31,286
It's actually a chance.

2703
02:03:31,287 --> 02:03:32,827
The questions are detailed.

2704
02:03:33,527 --> 02:03:34,956
Those are some thorough questions.

2705
02:03:34,957 --> 02:03:36,425
I think he will get a pass.

2706
02:03:36,426 --> 02:03:38,866
- I think Cheol Hyeon will like it. - I know.

2707
02:03:38,867 --> 02:03:40,595
What kind of a date does she like?

2708
02:03:40,596 --> 02:03:43,196
If you could tell me, I would appreciate it.

2709
02:03:43,197 --> 02:03:44,266
Cho A...

2710
02:03:46,237 --> 02:03:47,537
Cho A and I...

2711
02:03:50,936 --> 02:03:52,277
hate winter.

2712
02:03:53,877 --> 02:03:56,776
But we are going to Gangwon Province, right?

2713
02:03:56,777 --> 02:03:58,845
She will be very cold there.

2714
02:03:58,846 --> 02:04:01,345
How will you take care of Cho A...

2715
02:04:01,346 --> 02:04:03,287
when she is cold?

2716
02:04:03,957 --> 02:04:07,026
I would take her to a warm place right away.

2717
02:04:07,027 --> 02:04:10,026
Otherwise, we can do something fun...

2718
02:04:10,027 --> 02:04:11,527
so that she forgets about the cold.

2719
02:04:11,657 --> 02:04:13,666
I can tell you this.

2720
02:04:13,667 --> 02:04:16,237
Cho A likes coffee very much.

2721
02:04:16,266 --> 02:04:18,935
It would be nice to take her to a place...

2722
02:04:18,936 --> 02:04:20,207
that has tasty coffee.

2723
02:04:20,306 --> 02:04:21,566
I got some good tips.

2724
02:04:21,567 --> 02:04:23,276
She likes coffee.

2725
02:04:23,277 --> 02:04:26,276
So I thought it would be nice to take her...

2726
02:04:26,277 --> 02:04:28,917
to a nice coffee place in Gangwon Province.

2727
02:04:29,247 --> 02:04:31,007
What kind of a person do you think Cho A is?

2728
02:04:31,046 --> 02:04:34,316
She is calm, but she has a playful side.

2729
02:04:34,317 --> 02:04:37,685
I can tell that she tries to use nice words.

2730
02:04:37,686 --> 02:04:41,286
Sometimes, she makes a straightforward comment.

2731
02:04:41,287 --> 02:04:42,957
It's fun.

2732
02:04:43,127 --> 02:04:45,596
That was why I chose her.

2733
02:04:49,636 --> 02:04:52,337
I have a personal wish.

2734
02:04:53,337 --> 02:04:57,636
I don't want Cho A to get her feelings hurt.

2735
02:04:57,707 --> 02:05:00,377
I want her to meet someone nice.

2736
02:05:01,676 --> 02:05:05,046
I would think the same.

2737
02:05:06,516 --> 02:05:09,486
My very cool man, Jung Sub,

2738
02:05:09,487 --> 02:05:11,055
I think we can wrap up now.

2739
02:05:11,056 --> 02:05:12,286
- Already? - Yes.

2740
02:05:12,287 --> 02:05:13,787
I still have questions.

2741
02:05:13,926 --> 02:05:15,826
Ask them away then.

2742
02:05:15,827 --> 02:05:18,095
Does she like to receive presents?

2743
02:05:18,096 --> 02:05:20,666
Most people like to receive presents.

2744
02:05:20,667 --> 02:05:24,465
Right. What kind of a present does she like?

2745
02:05:24,466 --> 02:05:27,505
She likes all thoughtful presents.

2746
02:05:27,506 --> 02:05:29,537
I see. Okay.

2747
02:05:29,707 --> 02:05:33,046
Jung Sub, I think you will do it well.

2748
02:05:43,216 --> 02:05:45,686
Cho A's sibling, thank you very much.

2749
02:05:46,087 --> 02:05:48,556
- Okay. - I had a lot of fun.

2750
02:05:48,726 --> 02:05:51,826
He was very enthusiastic. It made me think,

2751
02:05:51,827 --> 02:05:53,795
"He has a lot of interest in my sister."

2752
02:05:53,796 --> 02:05:57,837
"He wants to get to know her." I could feel that.

2753
02:05:59,567 --> 02:06:03,377
(The Secret Room interview ends.)

2754
02:06:10,947 --> 02:06:12,787
Jae Hyung.

2755
02:06:13,046 --> 02:06:14,117
Hi.

2756
02:06:15,716 --> 02:06:18,686
(Male participants, please gather at the basement table.)

2757
02:06:20,627 --> 02:06:22,555
- I have no interest. - There are no feelings.

2758
02:06:22,556 --> 02:06:24,316
(He heads straight to the basement hideout.)

2759
02:06:27,896 --> 02:06:30,567
He showed us that he was doing something fun...

2760
02:06:30,966 --> 02:06:32,766
- as soon as he arrived. - He showed us that.

2761
02:06:32,806 --> 02:06:33,867
I am so curious.

2762
02:06:34,037 --> 02:06:35,506
The curiosity is killing me.

2763
02:06:39,907 --> 02:06:42,246
- Did you have a good time? - Yes.

2764
02:06:42,247 --> 02:06:44,047
I made a quick trip to the convenience store.

2765
02:06:47,546 --> 02:06:48,886
What is going on?

2766
02:06:49,056 --> 02:06:51,516
Is everyone going to the basement? What is going on?

2767
02:06:53,886 --> 02:06:55,685
Welcome back, Yong Woo.

2768
02:06:55,686 --> 02:06:57,795
Yong Woo was the only one who didn't go to the Secret Room.

2769
02:06:57,796 --> 02:06:59,697
He waited nearby before returning to the house.

2770
02:07:00,827 --> 02:07:02,747
Yong Woo, let me guess what you are going to do.

2771
02:07:03,266 --> 02:07:05,547
You are going to go head straight to the basement, right?

2772
02:07:08,667 --> 02:07:11,237
What are they doing in the basement?

2773
02:07:11,506 --> 02:07:13,076
- He is back. - Welcome back.

2774
02:07:13,077 --> 02:07:14,106
Hello.

2775
02:07:14,447 --> 02:07:15,747
I need to use the restroom.

2776
02:07:20,447 --> 02:07:22,386
- He's here. - Welcome.

2777
02:07:22,587 --> 02:07:23,916
- Hello. - What's up?

2778
02:07:23,917 --> 02:07:25,756
- Everyone is here. - You are here.

2779
02:07:25,926 --> 02:07:27,787
- I see that everyone is here. - Yes.

2780
02:07:28,587 --> 02:07:29,657
All right.

2781
02:07:37,466 --> 02:07:39,036
(The Secret Room interview has ended.)

2782
02:07:39,037 --> 02:07:40,965
(You can check the result of the interview through a call.)

2783
02:07:40,966 --> 02:07:42,305
(To prevent guess, we ask everyone to make a call.)

2784
02:07:42,306 --> 02:07:45,306
"Make a call to this number." I see.

2785
02:07:51,447 --> 02:07:54,386
(Yong Woo was the only one who chose Se Seung.)

2786
02:07:55,016 --> 02:07:58,117
(He doesn't know what the Secret Room is.)

2787
02:07:58,587 --> 02:08:00,686
Cheol Hyeon, let's stay still.

2788
02:08:02,256 --> 02:08:04,027
(Averting his eyes)

2789
02:08:04,556 --> 02:08:05,966
For the first time,

2790
02:08:06,367 --> 02:08:08,596
I lost my connection with Cheol Hyeon.

2791
02:08:08,966 --> 02:08:12,066
I thought he would look at me,

2792
02:08:12,067 --> 02:08:14,465
but he seemed to have a different thought.

2793
02:08:14,466 --> 02:08:15,605
I thought once again,

2794
02:08:15,606 --> 02:08:18,077
"This must be 'The Truman Show.'"

2795
02:08:18,106 --> 02:08:20,246
I can't believe it.

2796
02:08:20,247 --> 02:08:21,846
He lost his connection.

2797
02:08:22,207 --> 02:08:23,417
Disconnected.

2798
02:08:25,516 --> 02:08:28,287
All right. I don't know what's going on.

2799
02:08:32,457 --> 02:08:35,787
(Jae Hyung and Jung Sub talked at the Secret Room.)

2800
02:08:36,256 --> 02:08:38,756
(Cheol Hyeon's decision will be delivered.)

2801
02:08:44,567 --> 02:08:47,106
(Whom did Cheol Hyeon choose?)

2802
02:08:47,306 --> 02:08:48,736
I will make the call.

2803
02:08:48,737 --> 02:08:49,935
(Jung Sub checks the result first.)

2804
02:08:49,936 --> 02:08:51,976
All right.

2805
02:08:53,947 --> 02:08:54,976
Okay.

2806
02:09:07,726 --> 02:09:10,396
Cho A's sibling chose you.

2807
02:09:10,796 --> 02:09:13,226
You will have a date with Cho A.

2808
02:09:13,697 --> 02:09:16,436
Hang up and go back to your seat.

2809
02:09:17,237 --> 02:09:18,237
Okay.

2810
02:09:25,806 --> 02:09:27,877
It felt really nice.

2811
02:09:28,976 --> 02:09:31,976
Cho A's sibling approved of me.

2812
02:09:32,447 --> 02:09:35,417
I must have seemed nice in the eyes of a fellow man.

2813
02:09:36,087 --> 02:09:38,457
- It's important. - It feels even nicer.

2814
02:09:38,556 --> 02:09:40,286
- When you get that approval... - That's the characteristic...

2815
02:09:40,287 --> 02:09:41,386
of this show.

2816
02:09:41,487 --> 02:09:42,526
It's something you can see only on this show.

2817
02:09:42,527 --> 02:09:43,527
- That's right. - That's right.

2818
02:09:43,528 --> 02:09:44,657
It would feel nice.

2819
02:09:45,027 --> 02:09:47,027
I was thankful. It also felt nice.

2820
02:09:47,426 --> 02:09:49,497
I chose Jung Sub...

2821
02:09:49,596 --> 02:09:52,095
because he came into the room and asked about Cho A...

2822
02:09:52,096 --> 02:09:54,136
before I asked him questions.

2823
02:09:54,237 --> 02:09:56,377
Jung Sub began to talk faster.

2824
02:09:56,476 --> 02:09:59,037
"I will win over Cho A."

2825
02:09:59,476 --> 02:10:00,876
"I won't let anyone else take her."

2826
02:10:01,646 --> 02:10:04,377
I saw that determination in his eyes.

2827
02:10:04,577 --> 02:10:08,587
I remember him going, "Is it over already?"

2828
02:10:08,787 --> 02:10:10,107
I thought it was a definite sign.

2829
02:10:10,657 --> 02:10:13,426
He is interested in my sister.

2830
02:10:13,627 --> 02:10:17,725
Jae Hyung and Jung Sub were different in many ways.

2831
02:10:17,726 --> 02:10:19,465
While Jae Hyung is a good man,

2832
02:10:19,466 --> 02:10:21,127
it didn't seem like...

2833
02:10:21,226 --> 02:10:24,537
he was very curious about my sister.

2834
02:10:25,837 --> 02:10:28,506
Jae Hyung wasn't on my list of brother-in-law candidates.

2835
02:10:29,337 --> 02:10:30,506
It ended very quickly.

2836
02:10:32,407 --> 02:10:34,377
You can go and make the call now.

2837
02:10:34,877 --> 02:10:35,877
Okay.

2838
02:10:38,846 --> 02:10:40,046
- You are done, right? - Yes.

2839
02:10:43,487 --> 02:10:46,886
(Everyone made the call to keep the others from guessing.)

2840
02:10:48,827 --> 02:10:52,726
You look very cool today. Good luck.

2841
02:10:55,197 --> 02:10:58,037
(He keeps a poker face despite the sudden compliment.)

2842
02:10:59,037 --> 02:11:01,867
(Up next is Yong Woo, the man who doesn't know anything.)

2843
02:11:07,106 --> 02:11:11,016
You look very cool today. Good luck.

2844
02:11:11,346 --> 02:11:13,786
Hang up and go back to your seat.

2845
02:11:13,787 --> 02:11:15,947
(He doesn't understand the meaning of the compliment.)

2846
02:11:17,417 --> 02:11:19,056
"Was it a spam?"

2847
02:11:19,487 --> 02:11:22,056
"What is this? Shall I talk to the production crew?"

2848
02:11:23,627 --> 02:11:25,527
I was so flustered. I didn't understand.

2849
02:11:27,697 --> 02:11:30,396
Didn't you hang up in the middle of the call?

2850
02:11:30,596 --> 02:11:32,265
- What? - Didn't you hang up?

2851
02:11:32,266 --> 02:11:34,506
I think the connection left...

2852
02:11:35,106 --> 02:11:36,106
much to be desired.

2853
02:11:36,107 --> 02:11:38,707
Still, I understood the sentiment.

2854
02:11:42,506 --> 02:11:45,617
(Jae Hyung enters the room to hear the result.)

2855
02:11:52,856 --> 02:11:55,926
Cho A's sibling didn't choose you.

2856
02:11:59,226 --> 02:12:00,827
I didn't get chosen.

2857
02:12:02,527 --> 02:12:03,537
I was like, "What?"

2858
02:12:04,436 --> 02:12:05,436
"Why?"

2859
02:12:05,896 --> 02:12:09,037
It was a bit confusing.

2860
02:12:09,606 --> 02:12:12,105
You can choose a new date...

2861
02:12:12,106 --> 02:12:13,846
or give up on the date.

2862
02:12:14,176 --> 02:12:16,817
You can't choose the previous person.

2863
02:12:17,117 --> 02:12:19,447
Number 1, Ji Won. Number 2, give up on the date.

2864
02:12:19,846 --> 02:12:22,755
If you would like to hear it again, please say, "Repeat."

2865
02:12:22,756 --> 02:12:24,417
(Jae Hyung was given another choice.)

2866
02:12:26,356 --> 02:12:28,185
- Really? - One of the two.

2867
02:12:28,186 --> 02:12:29,425
Give up on the date or Ji Won.

2868
02:12:29,426 --> 02:12:31,726
I think he would give up on the date.

2869
02:12:32,197 --> 02:12:33,795
I think he would choose Ji Won.

2870
02:12:33,796 --> 02:12:34,895
He would still choose Ji Won.

2871
02:12:34,896 --> 02:12:36,765
It's better than not doing anything.

2872
02:12:36,766 --> 02:12:38,895
I feel like Jae Hyung would choose not to do anything.

2873
02:12:38,896 --> 02:12:40,737
Seriously. I think he would give up.

2874
02:12:40,936 --> 02:12:45,306
(Number 1, Ji Won Number 2, give up on the date)

2875
02:12:46,476 --> 02:12:48,276
(Jae Hyung chose Ji Won.)

2876
02:12:48,277 --> 02:12:50,277
We root for your date.

2877
02:12:50,577 --> 02:12:53,587
Hang up and go back to the table.

2878
02:13:04,926 --> 02:13:05,926
All right.

2879
02:13:20,106 --> 02:13:22,207
Jae Hyung didn't look happy.

2880
02:13:23,216 --> 02:13:26,487
I think Jae Hyung was the other one who chose Cho A.

2881
02:13:26,587 --> 02:13:28,686
I bet he feels uneasy.

2882
02:13:34,457 --> 02:13:35,487
All right.

2883
02:13:35,957 --> 02:13:37,326
(Shush! This is a secret message.)

2884
02:13:37,327 --> 02:13:38,725
(Don't show anyone.)

2885
02:13:38,726 --> 02:13:41,466
(Ji Won's sibling is waiting for you at the Secret Room.)

2886
02:13:42,497 --> 02:13:43,497
My goodness.

2887
02:13:43,498 --> 02:13:45,537
(Jae Hyung and Cheol Hyun chose Ji Won, )

2888
02:13:47,207 --> 02:13:50,037
(so the Secret Room opened again.)

2889
02:13:50,337 --> 02:13:52,136
- Hello, Jae Hyung. - Hello.

2890
02:13:53,046 --> 02:13:54,377
Why did you choose Ji Won?

2891
02:13:55,676 --> 02:13:57,917
(Ji Won's sibling will decide...)

2892
02:13:58,546 --> 02:14:00,886
(who her date will be.)

2893
02:14:01,117 --> 02:14:03,186
I hoped to get...

2894
02:14:03,287 --> 02:14:05,817
on the good side of Ji Won's sibling.

2895
02:14:05,917 --> 02:14:08,027
I didn't expect another step.

2896
02:14:09,756 --> 02:14:10,756
What?

2897
02:14:16,636 --> 02:14:18,156
I want to steal the phone and read it.

2898
02:14:22,207 --> 02:14:23,207
What?

2899
02:14:27,346 --> 02:14:29,447
I think things will get interesting this evening.

2900
02:14:32,317 --> 02:14:33,317
What?

2901
02:14:42,896 --> 02:14:44,796
Where are you going?

2902
02:14:45,256 --> 02:14:48,127
Me? I am going to a convenience store.

2903
02:14:50,497 --> 02:14:52,037
- See you later. - Okay.

2904
02:15:04,546 --> 02:15:07,386
(Secret Room)

2905
02:15:09,487 --> 02:15:13,756
(A participant who chose Ji Won, Jae Hyung entered.)

2906
02:15:27,567 --> 02:15:29,407
- Hello, Jae Hyung. - Hello.

2907
02:15:31,207 --> 02:15:32,707
Why did you choose Ji Won?

2908
02:15:39,447 --> 02:15:41,747
I wanted to talk to Ji Won.

2909
02:15:42,917 --> 02:15:44,016
Why?

2910
02:15:45,256 --> 02:15:48,286
Firstly, she joined later.

2911
02:15:48,287 --> 02:15:51,627
I had a chance to talk to other people.

2912
02:15:52,127 --> 02:15:56,226
But I didn't get to talk to Ji Won much.

2913
02:15:58,037 --> 02:16:00,106
What do you think Ji Won is like?

2914
02:16:04,606 --> 02:16:06,707
I think she is a calm type.

2915
02:16:08,747 --> 02:16:09,747
And?

2916
02:16:10,817 --> 02:16:12,277
I don't know her well yet.

2917
02:16:13,117 --> 02:16:16,487
If you go on a date with her, what do you want to do?

2918
02:16:17,256 --> 02:16:19,686
I want to look at the sea at Gangwon Province.

2919
02:16:20,027 --> 02:16:22,556
- The sea? I guess you like the sea. - I like the sea.

2920
02:16:23,597 --> 02:16:25,795
- What do you want to eat? - What do I want to eat?

2921
02:16:25,796 --> 02:16:27,497
Ji Won likes pork belly.

2922
02:16:27,597 --> 02:16:29,865
Ji Won? I see. I really like pork belly.

2923
02:16:29,866 --> 02:16:31,035
I am really good at grilling pork belly.

2924
02:16:31,036 --> 02:16:33,136
- I am really good at grilling meat. - Really?

2925
02:16:33,507 --> 02:16:35,506
He is a bit different this time, right?

2926
02:16:35,507 --> 02:16:36,635
There is desperation.

2927
02:16:36,636 --> 02:16:38,135
He failed once.

2928
02:16:38,136 --> 02:16:39,476
Do better.

2929
02:16:39,706 --> 02:16:41,077
Ji Won likes pork belly.

2930
02:16:41,177 --> 02:16:43,445
Ji Won? I see. I really like pork belly.

2931
02:16:43,446 --> 02:16:44,676
I am really good at grilling pork belly.

2932
02:16:44,677 --> 02:16:46,747
- I am really good at grilling meat. - Really?

2933
02:16:47,417 --> 02:16:49,716
- Do you like to drink? - I like to drink.

2934
02:16:50,987 --> 02:16:51,987
Okay then.

2935
02:16:53,927 --> 02:16:57,156
I see that Ji Won's sibling is very straightforward...

2936
02:16:57,157 --> 02:16:58,497
and cool.

2937
02:16:58,696 --> 02:17:00,427
This is about my sibling, not me.

2938
02:17:01,466 --> 02:17:02,466
Right.

2939
02:17:03,267 --> 02:17:04,796
What's your MBTI?

2940
02:17:04,997 --> 02:17:06,267
- My MBTI? - Yes.

2941
02:17:06,407 --> 02:17:08,167
It's ENTJ.

2942
02:17:08,267 --> 02:17:09,636
- ENTJ? - Yes.

2943
02:17:11,077 --> 02:17:12,677
What kind of a personality type is that?

2944
02:17:23,657 --> 02:17:25,187
He asked about my MBTI.

2945
02:17:25,757 --> 02:17:27,226
When I told him,

2946
02:17:27,327 --> 02:17:31,257
he said, "What kind of a personality type is that?"

2947
02:17:31,626 --> 02:17:35,366
I didn't think other participants would say that.

2948
02:17:36,327 --> 02:17:38,296
(The first day)

2949
02:17:40,206 --> 02:17:44,476
(Cheol Hyun, Jae Hyung, and Jung Sub are all ENTJ.)

2950
02:17:45,706 --> 02:17:48,206
(The participant who came last, Yong Woo is the same.)

2951
02:17:49,677 --> 02:17:52,216
(They know that all men's MBTI is ENTJ.)

2952
02:17:53,546 --> 02:17:54,645
He is someone new.

2953
02:17:54,646 --> 02:17:57,187
(Thus, Ji Won's sibling has to be someone new.)

2954
02:17:59,216 --> 02:18:02,286
(Who is Ji Won's sibling Jae Hyung is talking to?)

2955
02:18:24,776 --> 02:18:28,087
(Ji Won's sibling chose you.)

2956
02:18:28,286 --> 02:18:30,215
(Do you like steamed bun?)

2957
02:18:30,216 --> 02:18:32,116
(I love steamed bun.)

2958
02:18:33,757 --> 02:18:35,886
(The Burning Romance)

2959
02:18:35,987 --> 02:18:37,473
(- We enjoyed it properly. - We enjoyed it properly.)

2960
02:18:37,497 --> 02:18:38,926
(How do we suit each other so well?)

2961
02:18:38,927 --> 02:18:40,625
(I really like...)

2962
02:18:40,626 --> 02:18:41,965
(the smile...)

2963
02:18:41,966 --> 02:18:43,896
(you show me when our eyes meet.)

2964
02:18:44,636 --> 02:18:46,636
(I really like it.)

2965
02:18:46,737 --> 02:18:48,236
(The older age, the same age, or the younger age?)

2966
02:18:48,237 --> 02:18:49,266
(Let's say I am younger.)

2967
02:18:49,267 --> 02:18:51,076
(How would you feel then?)

2968
02:18:51,077 --> 02:18:52,936
(Was it too direct?)

2969
02:18:52,937 --> 02:18:54,246
(In that case...)

2970
02:18:54,247 --> 02:18:55,576
Keep it a secret.

2971
02:18:55,577 --> 02:18:56,616
I am embarrassed.

2972
02:18:57,546 --> 02:18:58,816
(The prepared lodgings include...)

2973
02:18:58,817 --> 02:19:00,086
(a 4-people room, a 3-people room, and a 2-people room.)

2974
02:19:00,087 --> 02:19:01,622
(Please discuss among yourselves and pick a card.)

2975
02:19:01,646 --> 02:19:03,285
(My heart fluttered more.)

2976
02:19:03,286 --> 02:19:05,517
("Nothing would happen." I had that thought.)

2977
02:19:06,657 --> 02:19:09,026
(It brought on an inner war.)

2978
02:19:09,757 --> 02:19:12,456
(A fun trip began.)
