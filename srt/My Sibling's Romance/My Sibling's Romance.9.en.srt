1
00:00:00,102 --> 00:00:01,602
(Welcome back.)

2
00:00:02,703 --> 00:00:05,372
(Jae Hyung: Nothing's changed. Yong Woo: A lot has changed.)

3
00:00:05,373 --> 00:00:09,342
(Their family grew.)

4
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:11,642
(Seriously though, why did you choose my sister?)

5
00:00:11,643 --> 00:00:12,773
(She was the only one I could see!)

6
00:00:12,774 --> 00:00:14,412
(That's it. Nothing more.)

7
00:00:14,413 --> 00:00:16,643
(My sister likes someone who is serious...)

8
00:00:17,314 --> 00:00:19,153
(but humorous.)

9
00:00:19,154 --> 00:00:20,154
(Giving up)

10
00:00:20,155 --> 00:00:21,184
(Sighing)

11
00:00:23,154 --> 00:00:26,953
(A nervous date has started.)

12
00:00:28,523 --> 00:00:30,724
(Goodness, what should I do?)

13
00:00:31,964 --> 00:00:34,492
(His hands were shaking.)

14
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:37,162
(Him being nervous looked cute...)

15
00:00:37,163 --> 00:00:38,873
(and fun.)

16
00:00:40,434 --> 00:00:43,103
(A recital in the hideout)

17
00:00:43,104 --> 00:00:45,473
(We played the piano together side by side, )

18
00:00:45,474 --> 00:00:47,812
(and it made my heart flutter.)

19
00:00:47,813 --> 00:00:50,743
(You're not bad.)

20
00:00:51,184 --> 00:00:52,583
(C...)

21
00:00:57,123 --> 00:01:00,092
(That was really hot.)

22
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:02,023
(Jung Sub and Ji Won...)

23
00:01:02,024 --> 00:01:03,862
(slept at 10am.)

24
00:01:03,863 --> 00:01:06,592
(But they drank too much towards the end.)

25
00:01:06,593 --> 00:01:08,232
(At 10am?)

26
00:01:08,233 --> 00:01:10,463
(I wasn't happy about that.)

27
00:01:10,464 --> 00:01:13,532
(I don't know what happened.)

28
00:01:13,533 --> 00:01:16,203
(I thought to myself, "Jung Sub's feelings might have changed.")

29
00:01:16,604 --> 00:01:19,044
(I got hurt.)

30
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,982
(Jung Sub's heart went to Ji Won.)

31
00:01:24,983 --> 00:01:27,383
(I hope Ji Won chooses me.)

32
00:01:27,384 --> 00:01:29,922
(I chose None.)

33
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,752
(I sent None.)

34
00:01:31,753 --> 00:01:34,252
(Jung Sub didn't receive a message.)

35
00:01:34,253 --> 00:01:37,294
(The siblings' night was rough.)

36
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:41,963
My hair.

37
00:01:41,964 --> 00:01:43,163
(Yun Jae is checking his hair.)

38
00:01:43,164 --> 00:01:45,003
It's so messy.

39
00:01:46,274 --> 00:01:48,074
Why am I so bad at styling my hair?

40
00:01:50,774 --> 00:01:51,774
I look so ugly.

41
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:57,444
(The restaurant owner empties the bin first.)

42
00:01:59,553 --> 00:02:02,023
Hold on. Where's the melon rind?

43
00:02:03,124 --> 00:02:04,182
Here.

44
00:02:04,183 --> 00:02:05,253
(He found a melon rind in the general waste plastic bag.)

45
00:02:05,254 --> 00:02:06,923
(This is bad)

46
00:02:07,324 --> 00:02:09,264
(Food waste goes here)

47
00:02:09,694 --> 00:02:11,094
You're here.

48
00:02:11,294 --> 00:02:13,764
- Hi, Yun Ha. - You're tidying up again.

49
00:02:14,363 --> 00:02:16,103
Shall I make coffee for you?

50
00:02:16,104 --> 00:02:17,403
I would love that.

51
00:02:17,534 --> 00:02:19,504
I'll just throw this out quickly.

52
00:02:32,553 --> 00:02:34,953
Thanks for the coffee.

53
00:02:35,553 --> 00:02:37,783
Do this, and wait.

54
00:02:37,784 --> 00:02:39,100
(Pour hot water onto powdered coffee beans.)

55
00:02:39,124 --> 00:02:40,294
Something's coming out.

56
00:02:42,694 --> 00:02:43,993
How was your sleep?

57
00:02:44,363 --> 00:02:46,563
Good. We spent time in the hideout again.

58
00:02:46,564 --> 00:02:48,164
You spent time in the hideout again?

59
00:02:48,403 --> 00:02:50,903
There were people there.

60
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:52,784
Why did you have fun without me?

61
00:02:54,773 --> 00:02:56,444
Until what time did you stay there?

62
00:02:57,044 --> 00:02:58,104
Until 5:30am?

63
00:03:01,474 --> 00:03:03,083
Thank you for the coffee, it's nice.

64
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:07,113
- I'm glad. - Yun Ha made coffee for me.

65
00:03:07,384 --> 00:03:09,423
I felt really happy.

66
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:11,953
You look good in pink too.

67
00:03:12,224 --> 00:03:13,294
- Really? - Yes.

68
00:03:14,993 --> 00:03:16,992
You look really good in light pink.

69
00:03:16,993 --> 00:03:19,563
Doesn't Yun Jae seem to be more relaxed now?

70
00:03:19,564 --> 00:03:20,992
He was very nervous before.

71
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:23,063
He used to tremble, but he doesn't anymore.

72
00:03:23,064 --> 00:03:25,533
These two have the best mood for now.

73
00:03:25,534 --> 00:03:27,334
- Yes, theirs is the best. - Right? The mood.

74
00:03:28,743 --> 00:03:31,713
(You look really good in light pink.)

75
00:03:32,173 --> 00:03:34,314
(The coffee time for just the two of them ends.)

76
00:03:34,743 --> 00:03:35,883
Are you going now?

77
00:03:35,884 --> 00:03:37,212
- Should I carry this down? - Now that I think about it...

78
00:03:37,213 --> 00:03:38,483
Yes, thank you.

79
00:03:38,884 --> 00:03:40,453
- It's heavy. - It's okay.

80
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:43,683
I'll go down and tell the others.

81
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:44,993
Thank you.

82
00:03:49,224 --> 00:03:50,294
This is bad.

83
00:03:50,624 --> 00:03:52,264
Why? You...

84
00:03:53,463 --> 00:03:55,504
- See you later. - Thank you.

85
00:03:57,164 --> 00:03:59,732
(After Yun Ha leaves, )

86
00:03:59,733 --> 00:04:03,903
(a man approaches the house with light footsteps.)

87
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:10,783
- Hello. - Gosh, hello.

88
00:04:11,343 --> 00:04:12,553
Are you a new participant?

89
00:04:12,554 --> 00:04:14,152
I was already here.

90
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:16,883
- Your hair tells me you're new. - I see.

91
00:04:16,884 --> 00:04:18,282
You changed completely.

92
00:04:18,283 --> 00:04:19,623
(Park Cheol Hyeon cuts his hair for the 2nd time.)

93
00:04:19,624 --> 00:04:21,124
- Are you eating? - Yes.

94
00:04:22,764 --> 00:04:28,033
(Se Seung looks at the picture that she took with Jung Sub.)

95
00:04:34,134 --> 00:04:36,842
I honestly had a hard time the day before.

96
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:39,342
I was sure that Jung Sub had...

97
00:04:39,343 --> 00:04:41,642
a change of heart, which was confirmed...

98
00:04:41,643 --> 00:04:43,842
by the absence of his message.

99
00:04:43,843 --> 00:04:46,384
(Yesterday night)

100
00:04:47,213 --> 00:04:51,323
(Jung Sub sent a message to Ji Won.)

101
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:55,364
(Se Seung chose None.)

102
00:04:56,824 --> 00:04:59,434
- My heart hurts. - It really hurt my heart. Se Seung.

103
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,203
She must have a lot going in her head.

104
00:05:02,634 --> 00:05:05,504
When she suppressed her feelings and chose None,

105
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:07,304
what would she have felt?

106
00:05:22,984 --> 00:05:25,652
Since I liked him a lot,

107
00:05:25,653 --> 00:05:27,324
I was quite hurt.

108
00:05:31,093 --> 00:05:34,892
I do want to have a talk with Jung Sub.

109
00:05:34,893 --> 00:05:36,364
I will,

110
00:05:37,234 --> 00:05:39,673
but I want to talk with him...

111
00:05:39,674 --> 00:05:40,973
when I can act cool.

112
00:05:41,603 --> 00:05:44,643
(Se Seung heads out.)

113
00:05:45,773 --> 00:05:48,114
(That evening)

114
00:05:48,913 --> 00:05:50,244
Have you had dinner?

115
00:05:50,614 --> 00:05:52,884
There's one ham cheese sandwich left.

116
00:05:53,184 --> 00:05:54,384
Then I'll eat this.

117
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:56,054
Do you know where Se Seung went?

118
00:05:56,754 --> 00:05:58,730
- No. She wasn't around today. - Why isn't she home?

119
00:05:58,754 --> 00:06:01,624
(Se Seung returns.)

120
00:06:03,324 --> 00:06:04,463
Who is it?

121
00:06:04,624 --> 00:06:05,994
Guess who.

122
00:06:07,434 --> 00:06:08,564
It's Se Seung.

123
00:06:08,934 --> 00:06:10,033
Where have you been?

124
00:06:11,634 --> 00:06:14,103
- It's a secret. - Have you eaten?

125
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:16,702
I didn't eat anything today.

126
00:06:16,703 --> 00:06:18,673
Then do you want this?

127
00:06:18,674 --> 00:06:19,712
(He passes her half of the ham cheese toast.)

128
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:20,773
Good.

129
00:06:20,843 --> 00:06:21,883
I like your clothes.

130
00:06:21,884 --> 00:06:24,513
- Really? Thank you. - Yes. Why?

131
00:06:24,514 --> 00:06:26,853
I like you better in knitwear.

132
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:29,384
- Me too. - I don't get what vibe you mean,

133
00:06:29,853 --> 00:06:31,054
but I guess so.

134
00:06:34,124 --> 00:06:35,163
What did you do today?

135
00:06:35,523 --> 00:06:37,793
I went to work.

136
00:06:38,163 --> 00:06:39,333
Did you only work?

137
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:41,633
I have too much leftover food, what to do?

138
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:42,903
Take care of it yourself.

139
00:06:43,804 --> 00:06:44,804
How cute.

140
00:06:45,533 --> 00:06:46,574
That's how she is.

141
00:06:47,773 --> 00:06:49,773
(Silence falls over after Yun Ha goes upstairs.)

142
00:06:50,504 --> 00:06:51,973
Have you used the basement hideout?

143
00:06:52,314 --> 00:06:54,313
Yes, with my brother yesterday.

144
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:55,583
- Really? - Yes.

145
00:06:56,413 --> 00:06:57,583
Shall we use it?

146
00:07:04,453 --> 00:07:05,593
- Really? - Yes.

147
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:06,893
Okay.

148
00:07:07,853 --> 00:07:10,263
As I was coming back home, I was thinking...

149
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:11,662
of asking him to go downstairs with me.

150
00:07:11,663 --> 00:07:14,292
I was going to do it, but he thought of the same thing...

151
00:07:14,293 --> 00:07:16,004
at the same time.

152
00:07:16,264 --> 00:07:17,963
I really liked that.

153
00:07:18,264 --> 00:07:21,634
But I was very nervous because I didn't want to get hurt.

154
00:07:22,773 --> 00:07:23,874
Shall we do it now?

155
00:07:26,973 --> 00:07:30,384
I asked Se Seung to go to the hideout with me,

156
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:34,152
but Se Seung might find this situation itself uncomfortable.

157
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:37,453
"Things are going well between me and someone else."

158
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:40,522
She might feel uncomfortable because of that.

159
00:07:40,523 --> 00:07:41,893
That was what I thought.

160
00:07:42,463 --> 00:07:45,564
(Jung Sub requested a conversation with Se Seung.)

161
00:07:46,093 --> 00:07:48,363
(Ju Yeon comes back from work.)

162
00:07:48,364 --> 00:07:50,963
- I'm back. - Hi, Ju Yeon.

163
00:07:51,364 --> 00:07:52,973
Please don't look at me.

164
00:07:53,174 --> 00:07:54,674
Why?

165
00:07:55,103 --> 00:07:56,403
I'm not wearing any makeup.

166
00:07:56,944 --> 00:07:58,043
Okay.

167
00:07:58,343 --> 00:08:00,313
Everyone, gather around and look at Ju Yeon.

168
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:01,984
- Your baggage... - Excuse me.

169
00:08:02,514 --> 00:08:05,143
- Excuse me, look at Ju Yeon. - Look here.

170
00:08:05,413 --> 00:08:06,413
Ju Yeon...

171
00:08:07,283 --> 00:08:10,423
- Why are brothers like that? - What's with Yong Woo again?

172
00:08:10,424 --> 00:08:12,694
(Everyone, gather around and look at Ju Yeon.)

173
00:08:13,194 --> 00:08:15,823
(Protecting her bare face)

174
00:08:15,824 --> 00:08:17,293
- Look at Ju Yeon. - Look here.

175
00:08:17,723 --> 00:08:19,593
- Look here. - Look here.

176
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:23,003
(She successfully enters the safe zone.)

177
00:08:23,004 --> 00:08:24,264
(Feeling proud)

178
00:08:26,004 --> 00:08:27,104
But we...

179
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:29,903
We need to go down in secret.

180
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,344
It's too...

181
00:08:32,543 --> 00:08:35,143
(There are too many people.)

182
00:08:35,783 --> 00:08:37,083
Should I go in first?

183
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:38,983
Should I go in first? Do you want to go in first?

184
00:08:38,984 --> 00:08:40,944
Should I go in first? Do you want to go in first?

185
00:08:41,283 --> 00:08:43,084
Be quiet.

186
00:08:46,224 --> 00:08:48,393
(Feigning ignorance)

187
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:53,234
(Se Seung gives him a signal with the blanket.)

188
00:08:55,063 --> 00:08:57,134
(Jung Sub moves.)

189
00:08:57,604 --> 00:08:58,974
Finally, goodness.

190
00:08:59,104 --> 00:09:01,704
(Jung Sub goes down to the hideout first.)

191
00:09:09,143 --> 00:09:11,543
(Standing awkwardly)

192
00:09:12,984 --> 00:09:15,584
(She touches the tissue case needlessly.)

193
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:18,724
(She finally enters.)

194
00:09:23,494 --> 00:09:25,864
I can't change it to "in use."

195
00:09:26,293 --> 00:09:27,892
- What should we do? - What should we do?

196
00:09:27,893 --> 00:09:29,032
That...

197
00:09:29,033 --> 00:09:31,162
(Grabbing the washing machine)

198
00:09:31,163 --> 00:09:33,772
- What should we do? - The two of them were right there.

199
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:34,834
This is too...

200
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:37,004
I should ask my sister to change it to "in use."

201
00:09:49,124 --> 00:09:50,954
(A suspicious shadow lurks.)

202
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:58,494
I went up...

203
00:09:58,563 --> 00:10:01,563
and made a direct eye contact with Yong Woo...

204
00:10:02,303 --> 00:10:03,334
through that gap.

205
00:10:05,673 --> 00:10:08,133
When they come up, they'll face a beast.

206
00:10:08,134 --> 00:10:09,779
(In the end, he got caught by Yong Woo again.)

207
00:10:09,803 --> 00:10:11,773
What? "In use?"

208
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:14,443
With who?

209
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:18,813
- Gosh. - Did you succeed?

210
00:10:19,484 --> 00:10:21,014
- Yes, for now. - Really?

211
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:24,854
Yong Woo was staring with very bright eyes.

212
00:10:25,494 --> 00:10:27,129
- At you changing the sign? - He must've been curious.

213
00:10:27,153 --> 00:10:28,293
Yong Woo said,

214
00:10:28,553 --> 00:10:29,793
"In use?"

215
00:10:30,823 --> 00:10:33,393
It felt like he was asking, "Why are you two going there?"

216
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:35,233
It felt like he was checking.

217
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:38,633
I kept getting the feeling of Yong Woo checking on Se Seung...

218
00:10:38,634 --> 00:10:39,974
in that regard.

219
00:10:40,033 --> 00:10:41,573
They did date once,

220
00:10:41,673 --> 00:10:44,244
so I obviously thought, "Is something going on well?"

221
00:10:44,773 --> 00:10:46,073
- Hello. - Hello.

222
00:10:46,214 --> 00:10:48,942
- How are you? - I'm good, how are you?

223
00:10:48,943 --> 00:10:50,043
Me?

224
00:10:50,643 --> 00:10:53,454
It was a bit tough.

225
00:10:53,683 --> 00:10:55,313
Then...

226
00:10:57,653 --> 00:10:58,993
let's jump to the conclusion.

227
00:10:58,994 --> 00:11:00,692
- Jump to the conclusion? - Yes.

228
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:03,464
- Okay. - What is it now?

229
00:11:03,624 --> 00:11:04,663
What is?

230
00:11:05,193 --> 00:11:06,364
Where is it?

231
00:11:07,163 --> 00:11:08,234
My heart?

232
00:11:08,964 --> 00:11:10,562
- That's good. - "Where is it?"

233
00:11:10,563 --> 00:11:12,532
- That's really good. - Where is his heart at?

234
00:11:12,533 --> 00:11:13,704
- Exactly. - I love that.

235
00:11:13,874 --> 00:11:16,073
What is it now?

236
00:11:16,303 --> 00:11:17,303
What is?

237
00:11:17,773 --> 00:11:18,943
Where is it?

238
00:11:19,714 --> 00:11:20,714
My heart?

239
00:11:21,474 --> 00:11:23,083
- That's good. - "Where is it?"

240
00:11:23,084 --> 00:11:25,042
- That's really good. - Where is his heart at?

241
00:11:25,043 --> 00:11:26,384
- Exactly. - I love that.

242
00:11:26,484 --> 00:11:28,313
She's asking directly.

243
00:11:28,413 --> 00:11:29,983
She asked where his heart belonged to.

244
00:11:29,984 --> 00:11:31,723
And it didn't feel too overbearing.

245
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:33,692
It was a witty question.

246
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:34,793
"Where is it?"

247
00:11:34,854 --> 00:11:36,493
BamBam, where are you?

248
00:11:36,494 --> 00:11:38,192
(BamBam could not join the filming due to a world tour.)

249
00:11:38,193 --> 00:11:40,193
Where on earth are you?

250
00:11:40,393 --> 00:11:41,639
- BamBam. - When are you coming back?

251
00:11:41,663 --> 00:11:42,734
I miss you.

252
00:11:43,734 --> 00:11:45,703
(Where is it?)

253
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:46,773
(My heart?)

254
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:50,474
My heart?

255
00:11:53,874 --> 00:11:55,143
Should I be honest?

256
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:56,943
Yes. Wait.

257
00:11:59,854 --> 00:12:03,223
I didn't know what he was going to say.

258
00:12:03,224 --> 00:12:05,223
I felt...

259
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:08,223
that even if Jung Sub's feelings had changed,

260
00:12:08,224 --> 00:12:09,892
he was the kind of person to ask me for a conversation...

261
00:12:09,893 --> 00:12:12,133
to tell me about the change.

262
00:12:12,134 --> 00:12:13,463
I was very nervous.

263
00:12:13,464 --> 00:12:14,810
(She asked the question, but she is nervous.)

264
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:16,234
- Conclusion... - Tell me honestly.

265
00:12:16,464 --> 00:12:19,033
I haven't reached a conclusion yet.

266
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:25,642
Very strangely, she keeps getting on my mind.

267
00:12:25,643 --> 00:12:27,714
Who keeps getting on your mind?

268
00:12:29,313 --> 00:12:30,442
You.

269
00:12:30,443 --> 00:12:31,683
- Me? - Yes.

270
00:12:32,584 --> 00:12:34,413
Why did you add "strangely?"

271
00:12:35,484 --> 00:12:37,084
"Getting on my mind?"

272
00:12:37,584 --> 00:12:40,322
This phrase isn't suitable...

273
00:12:40,323 --> 00:12:43,293
for this period of time, is it?

274
00:12:43,693 --> 00:12:45,363
Actually, I had a feeling...

275
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:47,662
that I was supposed to...

276
00:12:47,663 --> 00:12:49,503
date everyone once.

277
00:12:49,504 --> 00:12:50,802
In this space?

278
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:53,974
Yes, so I tried to commit to it.

279
00:12:54,533 --> 00:12:56,004
But someone kept getting on my mind.

280
00:12:56,374 --> 00:12:58,343
- Me? - Yes. So...

281
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:01,214
I invited you here for us to talk openly.

282
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:05,754
I thought you had a change of heart.

283
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:08,473
You're talking about that, right?

284
00:13:09,254 --> 00:13:10,323
That's right.

285
00:13:10,954 --> 00:13:12,124
That 10am.

286
00:13:12,653 --> 00:13:14,652
(He brought up the drinking party he had at dawn yesterday.)

287
00:13:14,653 --> 00:13:17,893
But when I checked the time, I was shocked too.

288
00:13:18,393 --> 00:13:19,932
He drank with Ji Won...

289
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:22,032
for a long time until the morning.

290
00:13:22,033 --> 00:13:24,864
I think he sent the message to Ji Won.

291
00:13:25,403 --> 00:13:27,072
We started late to begin with.

292
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:29,033
(She keeps feeling bothered by yesterday's dawn.)

293
00:13:29,344 --> 00:13:31,974
And I did want to get close to her.

294
00:13:32,974 --> 00:13:34,114
I was curious about her.

295
00:13:36,744 --> 00:13:38,014
Am I being too honest?

296
00:13:38,744 --> 00:13:39,754
I really like that.

297
00:13:39,884 --> 00:13:40,884
- Really? - Yes.

298
00:13:40,885 --> 00:13:44,152
I felt that we had similar personalities.

299
00:13:44,153 --> 00:13:46,624
So I thought I would be comfortable around her.

300
00:13:46,954 --> 00:13:48,123
So I was curious.

301
00:13:48,124 --> 00:13:49,562
Yun Jae joined us too,

302
00:13:49,563 --> 00:13:51,093
and he's going on a date with my sister,

303
00:13:51,094 --> 00:13:52,193
so it was easy to ask.

304
00:13:56,134 --> 00:13:57,504
So...

305
00:13:58,634 --> 00:14:00,974
So what's your current state?

306
00:14:01,033 --> 00:14:02,403
What's my current state?

307
00:14:02,504 --> 00:14:03,572
What do you feel after you got to know the person...

308
00:14:03,573 --> 00:14:04,933
you wanted to find out more about?

309
00:14:05,374 --> 00:14:06,474
I feel relieved.

310
00:14:06,673 --> 00:14:08,793
Does that relief come from satisfying your curiosity?

311
00:14:08,844 --> 00:14:09,984
I got to know her.

312
00:14:10,283 --> 00:14:11,384
And?

313
00:14:11,514 --> 00:14:13,813
I just got to know her.

314
00:14:15,413 --> 00:14:16,922
I told her frankly.

315
00:14:16,923 --> 00:14:19,594
"It was nice drinking with Ji Won."

316
00:14:20,124 --> 00:14:21,623
"I did want to know more about her."

317
00:14:21,624 --> 00:14:24,993
"But I didn't have a change of heart."

318
00:14:24,994 --> 00:14:27,162
Everyone has different attitudes when participating...

319
00:14:27,163 --> 00:14:28,192
and has different standards.

320
00:14:28,193 --> 00:14:31,533
I could really feel that myself at that moment.

321
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:33,932
She's different from you?

322
00:14:33,933 --> 00:14:36,043
Yes, totally. And that's possible.

323
00:14:37,374 --> 00:14:39,142
He was curious about Ji Won.

324
00:14:39,143 --> 00:14:41,272
So he wanted to know more about her,

325
00:14:41,273 --> 00:14:44,182
and he felt that they didn't get along for some parts.

326
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:46,553
I know what actually happened.

327
00:14:48,084 --> 00:14:50,422
I have a question, but I don't think I should ask.

328
00:14:50,423 --> 00:14:52,182
- Ask me anything. - Really?

329
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:55,923
We were matched for one more date.

330
00:14:56,293 --> 00:14:58,692
But you gave the chance away.

331
00:14:58,693 --> 00:14:59,933
- Yes. - Why did you do that?

332
00:15:03,033 --> 00:15:04,364
Why did you give it away?

333
00:15:06,474 --> 00:15:08,003
- Well... - Yes.

334
00:15:08,004 --> 00:15:10,772
To be honest, I made up my mind as soon as I heard it.

335
00:15:10,773 --> 00:15:12,203
- As soon as I heard the question. - Really?

336
00:15:12,204 --> 00:15:13,412
As soon as I heard the question, I decided...

337
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:14,572
- to give the chance to my brother. - Really?

338
00:15:14,573 --> 00:15:16,313
- For real? - Yes.

339
00:15:16,714 --> 00:15:19,683
Why she chose the second option was important.

340
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:21,513
(Laughing)

341
00:15:21,514 --> 00:15:23,782
For the Siblings' Dilemma,

342
00:15:23,783 --> 00:15:25,623
I pressed Two without hesitation.

343
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:27,552
When he heard that at the dining table,

344
00:15:27,553 --> 00:15:31,162
"Does she not want to have a date with me?"

345
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:32,594
He must have thought that.

346
00:15:32,994 --> 00:15:35,933
I thought more about my brother's date.

347
00:15:36,004 --> 00:15:37,834
I wanted them to spend time together.

348
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:42,173
On top of that, I thought you would give away the chance.

349
00:15:42,273 --> 00:15:44,272
- Really? - Yes. So I was surprised...

350
00:15:44,273 --> 00:15:47,243
when you said you pressed One initially.

351
00:15:47,244 --> 00:15:48,873
- Is that so? - I thought you'd press Two...

352
00:15:48,874 --> 00:15:50,143
from the start.

353
00:15:50,584 --> 00:15:52,114
I could try.

354
00:15:52,714 --> 00:15:53,783
I don't know.

355
00:15:57,283 --> 00:15:58,353
"In use?"

356
00:15:58,354 --> 00:15:59,692
(She spots the hideout sign showing "in use.")

357
00:15:59,693 --> 00:16:01,624
Who's using it?

358
00:16:02,254 --> 00:16:03,364
Jung Sub.

359
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:05,224
Ji Won?

360
00:16:05,734 --> 00:16:07,134
Jung... Se Seung?

361
00:16:08,163 --> 00:16:10,403
(It's so interesting.)

362
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,432
- We'll get going. - See you.

363
00:16:13,433 --> 00:16:15,104
- Bye. - Bye.

364
00:16:16,303 --> 00:16:18,503
Make full use of the basement hideout.

365
00:16:18,504 --> 00:16:19,773
We went there yesterday.

366
00:16:20,114 --> 00:16:22,813
- Make more use of it. - But...

367
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:25,443
it's too soon to use it with him.

368
00:16:26,913 --> 00:16:28,753
I feel like it'll be too much for both of us.

369
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:29,754
I see.

370
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:32,124
I'll use it later if I need to.

371
00:16:33,354 --> 00:16:34,453
Let's go.

372
00:16:34,454 --> 00:16:37,693
(Yong Woo and Ju Yeon head out.)

373
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:41,234
(Meanwhile, Jung Sub and Se Seung in the hideout)

374
00:16:42,803 --> 00:16:45,004
The trip to Gangwon Province was very hard for me.

375
00:16:45,234 --> 00:16:47,572
Why was it hard? Since when?

376
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:49,773
It became very hard since the barbecue place.

377
00:16:50,744 --> 00:16:52,073
Let me just check this.

378
00:16:52,573 --> 00:16:55,043
Did you send her a text because you had feelings for her?

379
00:16:56,343 --> 00:16:58,624
Did you send it to her because you had a change of heart?

380
00:16:58,714 --> 00:17:00,954
That day was really fun.

381
00:17:01,184 --> 00:17:04,283
I sent it to her because I thought we had a very good time.

382
00:17:07,123 --> 00:17:08,553
But why was it hard?

383
00:17:09,363 --> 00:17:10,493
I sent...

384
00:17:10,494 --> 00:17:12,054
Because you didn't receive it from her?

385
00:17:12,994 --> 00:17:15,632
But was it hard when you didn't even have feelings...

386
00:17:15,633 --> 00:17:16,764
for her?

387
00:17:18,863 --> 00:17:21,772
- Se Seung's a bit scary. - You know, if she asks that way,

388
00:17:21,773 --> 00:17:23,943
there's no way to escape.

389
00:17:23,944 --> 00:17:25,272
If I were him, I would just ramble...

390
00:17:25,273 --> 00:17:26,833
and end up speaking the Congo language.

391
00:17:30,684 --> 00:17:32,583
I would blabber something.

392
00:17:32,654 --> 00:17:35,613
- I can't even speak that. - Yes, your brain is paralysed.

393
00:17:36,123 --> 00:17:38,052
And they didn't interact...

394
00:17:38,053 --> 00:17:39,993
for a long time,

395
00:17:39,994 --> 00:17:42,092
so she must've sharpened her knife very well.

396
00:17:42,093 --> 00:17:44,993
But until she said those questions,

397
00:17:44,994 --> 00:17:46,792
- imagine how much she must've... - That's right.

398
00:17:46,793 --> 00:17:48,592
Thought, replayed the scene, and reflected.

399
00:17:48,593 --> 00:17:50,632
Imagine how much she must've thought about it...

400
00:17:50,633 --> 00:17:52,433
for her to ask those questions smoothly.

401
00:17:52,434 --> 00:17:53,973
- It's as if she prepared them. - They come out systematically.

402
00:17:53,974 --> 00:17:56,244
- You're right. - She had a hard time.

403
00:17:57,103 --> 00:17:58,444
(But why was it hard?)

404
00:17:59,613 --> 00:18:00,673
(I sent...)

405
00:18:00,674 --> 00:18:02,474
(Because you didn't receive a text from her?)

406
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:06,783
(But was it hard when you didn't even have feelings for her?)

407
00:18:07,613 --> 00:18:09,183
- Just... - You were upset, right?

408
00:18:09,184 --> 00:18:10,253
No.

409
00:18:10,254 --> 00:18:12,724
I did feel a bit upset,

410
00:18:13,194 --> 00:18:16,463
but I thought, "Did I do something wrong?"

411
00:18:16,464 --> 00:18:18,592
- I kept replaying the scenes. - I get what you mean.

412
00:18:18,593 --> 00:18:22,362
- So... Everything was fine. - That's why you were unhappy.

413
00:18:22,363 --> 00:18:25,903
She said she had a fun time, so I was sure she would text me.

414
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:27,174
We had different standards.

415
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:29,033
That can happen, yes.

416
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:31,102
He said he sent Cho A a message...

417
00:18:31,103 --> 00:18:34,213
but he didn't receive one from her, and that gave him a hard time.

418
00:18:34,214 --> 00:18:39,154
"He's weaker than I thought."

419
00:18:39,383 --> 00:18:41,282
Now,

420
00:18:41,283 --> 00:18:43,984
I understand that that's possible.

421
00:18:47,093 --> 00:18:48,353
So I'm fine now.

422
00:18:49,994 --> 00:18:51,123
I had a hard time too.

423
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:53,332
- Really? - Yes.

424
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:54,633
- Really? - Yes.

425
00:18:55,904 --> 00:18:57,204
- Really? - Yes.

426
00:18:59,674 --> 00:19:01,572
Se Seung said that she had a hard time...

427
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:03,174
in the Gangwon Province trip too.

428
00:19:03,873 --> 00:19:06,174
What was hard for you?

429
00:19:06,674 --> 00:19:07,744
What?

430
00:19:12,813 --> 00:19:13,984
Don't you get it?

431
00:19:14,113 --> 00:19:15,684
No. Why?

432
00:19:16,724 --> 00:19:18,654
Because I thought you changed.

433
00:19:19,293 --> 00:19:20,523
- What? - Yes.

434
00:19:23,063 --> 00:19:24,123
- Oh, dear. - Yes.

435
00:19:25,694 --> 00:19:27,833
You're being so straightforward.

436
00:19:28,194 --> 00:19:29,632
You didn't even knock.

437
00:19:29,633 --> 00:19:31,632
You tore down the door as you came in.

438
00:19:31,633 --> 00:19:32,873
It was open.

439
00:19:33,303 --> 00:19:34,573
It was open, so I just...

440
00:19:36,904 --> 00:19:38,184
- I keep... - I'm feeling dizzy.

441
00:19:38,674 --> 00:19:40,273
Gosh, I'm feeling dizzy.

442
00:19:40,974 --> 00:19:41,974
You didn't know.

443
00:19:41,975 --> 00:19:44,812
I don't know what you're thinking.

444
00:19:44,813 --> 00:19:45,984
I don't know exactly.

445
00:19:46,754 --> 00:19:48,812
You might want to find out more about someone else...

446
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:51,322
and someone else might want to find out more...

447
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:52,424
about you.

448
00:19:52,523 --> 00:19:56,263
I didn't want to shut off her chance...

449
00:19:56,264 --> 00:19:59,122
to get closer to other men...

450
00:19:59,123 --> 00:20:02,934
because she might want to get to know more about others.

451
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:05,904
Still, it got on my nerves a bit.

452
00:20:06,504 --> 00:20:07,603
I couldn't help that.

453
00:20:09,204 --> 00:20:11,973
I thought I was taking away your chance.

454
00:20:11,974 --> 00:20:13,273
- My chance? - Yes.

455
00:20:13,714 --> 00:20:17,243
I think you're misunderstanding a lot of things.

456
00:20:17,244 --> 00:20:18,913
- Me? What misunderstanding? - Yes.

457
00:20:18,914 --> 00:20:21,254
I think you care about the others too much.

458
00:20:21,414 --> 00:20:23,483
You don't have to, though.

459
00:20:23,484 --> 00:20:25,454
- Really? - Yes.

460
00:20:27,194 --> 00:20:28,623
Do you feel refreshed now?

461
00:20:28,924 --> 00:20:31,322
Yes. You don't look refreshed, though.

462
00:20:31,323 --> 00:20:32,664
I feel refreshed.

463
00:20:35,293 --> 00:20:37,333
- Are you sure? - I feel so refreshed.

464
00:20:37,533 --> 00:20:40,203
After talking with Se Seung in the hideout,

465
00:20:40,204 --> 00:20:42,643
I feel a lot closer with Se Seung.

466
00:20:42,644 --> 00:20:45,003
It didn't end the way I wanted.

467
00:20:45,004 --> 00:20:48,542
Compared to the clarity I gave to Jung Sub,

468
00:20:48,543 --> 00:20:52,143
what he gave me was a bit iffy.

469
00:20:52,144 --> 00:20:54,782
The drink party in hideout ended like that,

470
00:20:54,783 --> 00:20:58,154
but there's still something that bothers me in my heart.

471
00:20:59,123 --> 00:21:00,292
- She's smart. - Right.

472
00:21:00,293 --> 00:21:01,670
She didn't get the answer she wanted.

473
00:21:01,694 --> 00:21:04,193
By the way, do you know the mistake the guys make...

474
00:21:04,194 --> 00:21:05,622
the most often here?

475
00:21:05,623 --> 00:21:07,733
- What is it? - They should accept...

476
00:21:07,734 --> 00:21:10,263
that conversation as a process to improve their relationship...

477
00:21:10,264 --> 00:21:11,763
and continue to remind themselves...

478
00:21:11,764 --> 00:21:13,234
- of this conversation. - Yes.

479
00:21:14,303 --> 00:21:15,849
- "It's over." - "I managed to get away."

480
00:21:15,873 --> 00:21:18,343
They think that the conversation clears up everything.

481
00:21:18,573 --> 00:21:21,013
But in fact, Se Seung said she wasn't fully satisfied with it.

482
00:21:21,014 --> 00:21:22,644
That's another negative feeling she got.

483
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:24,683
- He shouldn't have looked relieved. - It was like...

484
00:21:24,684 --> 00:21:26,754
- Right. Only he seemed relieved. - Yes.

485
00:21:27,484 --> 00:21:28,683
He can't look like he came out...

486
00:21:28,684 --> 00:21:30,364
- of the dry sauna after the gym. - Right.

487
00:21:31,484 --> 00:21:32,552
One of them seems relieved.

488
00:21:32,553 --> 00:21:33,592
- The other one looks unsatisfied. - She looks unsatisfied.

489
00:21:33,593 --> 00:21:34,623
Of course.

490
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:37,263
(Their conversation in the hideout ends with different feelings.)

491
00:21:37,264 --> 00:21:38,994
- Goodnight. - Goodnight.

492
00:21:42,664 --> 00:21:43,933
(Yun Ha and Se Seung come up to the 2nd floor.)

493
00:21:43,934 --> 00:21:46,004
- How was it? - What do you mean?

494
00:21:46,404 --> 00:21:47,533
How was your date?

495
00:21:48,704 --> 00:21:51,543
It was nice. He was really nervous.

496
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:53,973
I looked it up, but ENTJs...

497
00:21:53,974 --> 00:21:56,083
don't fall in love quickly.

498
00:21:56,383 --> 00:21:58,343
I looked it up once I got to Gangwon Province.

499
00:22:00,414 --> 00:22:02,283
- You're so funny. Seriously. - They don't.

500
00:22:03,353 --> 00:22:04,484
What did you talk about?

501
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:06,053
- With Sub? - Yes.

502
00:22:06,994 --> 00:22:08,914
Should I say we cleared up our misunderstanding?

503
00:22:09,353 --> 00:22:10,523
There was a misunderstanding?

504
00:22:10,924 --> 00:22:12,763
Yes. You guys talked a lot yesterday.

505
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:13,894
You didn't talk about that?

506
00:22:15,363 --> 00:22:17,632
He didn't tell me there was a misunderstanding.

507
00:22:17,633 --> 00:22:20,273
What did Jung Sub say to you yesterday?

508
00:22:20,904 --> 00:22:23,703
I don't know. I mean, you two went on a lot of dates.

509
00:22:23,704 --> 00:22:25,803
- Right. - He said it was very nice.

510
00:22:25,974 --> 00:22:28,474
But with Sub...

511
00:22:29,043 --> 00:22:33,253
Jung Sub was very expressive with me from the beginning.

512
00:22:33,254 --> 00:22:35,754
- Right. I felt it too. - He gave me a sense of certainty.

513
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:40,694
That's why my feelings started to grow bigger.

514
00:22:40,954 --> 00:22:42,292
But guys give you a sense of certainty,

515
00:22:42,293 --> 00:22:44,622
- you get excited. You know? - Right.

516
00:22:44,623 --> 00:22:46,464
That's why I thought it was riskier.

517
00:22:46,934 --> 00:22:47,994
- I see. - After all that,

518
00:22:49,293 --> 00:22:51,613
I saw so many possibilities that he might change his mind.

519
00:22:51,934 --> 00:22:53,910
I think his date in Gangwon Province left an impression on him.

520
00:22:53,934 --> 00:22:55,894
- I think so. - Mentally, I was cautious of that.

521
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:59,073
But actually feeling that was different.

522
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:01,173
I liked that...

523
00:23:01,174 --> 00:23:03,184
he gave me a sense of certainty during the date.

524
00:23:03,914 --> 00:23:07,714
But if he changes based on the situations, I would sort of...

525
00:23:09,553 --> 00:23:10,623
resent him.

526
00:23:11,654 --> 00:23:14,254
"Exactly. He shouldn't have done that. Darn it."

527
00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:17,663
I don't know if I should call it a misunderstanding.

528
00:23:17,664 --> 00:23:18,924
But that's how I felt.

529
00:23:19,424 --> 00:23:21,234
But he's really innocent.

530
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:22,664
I can tell.

531
00:23:22,863 --> 00:23:24,004
He's honest.

532
00:23:24,563 --> 00:23:27,633
He can be naive like a fool.

533
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:28,993
When he's in a relationship?

534
00:23:29,573 --> 00:23:31,443
I don't know if he's like that in a relationship.

535
00:23:31,444 --> 00:23:32,944
- You don't know? - Usually, he is.

536
00:23:33,573 --> 00:23:35,673
Starting yesterday, we got an option to skip sending the message.

537
00:23:35,674 --> 00:23:36,684
Right.

538
00:23:36,843 --> 00:23:38,112
- I... - I thought you didn't send any.

539
00:23:38,113 --> 00:23:39,490
- What? - I thought you didn't send any.

540
00:23:39,514 --> 00:23:40,553
- The message? - Yes.

541
00:23:41,254 --> 00:23:42,283
I didn't send it.

542
00:23:42,484 --> 00:23:43,583
- Right? - Yes.

543
00:23:43,823 --> 00:23:45,583
I knew it. I had a feeling.

544
00:23:45,984 --> 00:23:47,193
I thought...

545
00:23:47,194 --> 00:23:49,563
Jung Sub had a change of heart and feelings for Ji Won.

546
00:23:49,863 --> 00:23:52,292
I didn't want her to know that Jung Sub and I...

547
00:23:52,293 --> 00:23:54,764
were interested in each other in case it got in the way.

548
00:23:55,293 --> 00:23:56,933
But it hurt my feelings at the same time.

549
00:23:57,664 --> 00:23:59,872
- Gosh. It's going to make me cry. - So this is so hard.

550
00:23:59,873 --> 00:24:01,273
Then what should I do?

551
00:24:01,434 --> 00:24:03,674
- I already like all the girls here. - I mean...

552
00:24:03,904 --> 00:24:06,913
It gets more difficult as we bond more.

553
00:24:06,914 --> 00:24:08,244
Right. It's hard.

554
00:24:08,444 --> 00:24:10,684
- Everyone feels the same way. - Right.

555
00:24:10,984 --> 00:24:12,644
I think everyone is worried about that.

556
00:24:13,184 --> 00:24:14,782
Within these three weeks,

557
00:24:14,783 --> 00:24:16,052
we have to make a final decision.

558
00:24:16,053 --> 00:24:17,799
But if we do that for the sake of making a decision,

559
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:18,983
- we might lose... - Right.

560
00:24:18,984 --> 00:24:21,153
- something more valuable. - I had the same thought.

561
00:24:21,154 --> 00:24:22,823
- I'm sure everyone thinks that. - Yes.

562
00:24:23,093 --> 00:24:24,093
(Groaning)

563
00:24:25,264 --> 00:24:26,793
Someone must be working out again.

564
00:24:26,894 --> 00:24:30,563
(Someone is working out.)

565
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:32,504
I think it's Jung Sub.

566
00:24:33,133 --> 00:24:34,174
It must be Jung Sub.

567
00:24:34,603 --> 00:24:36,133
- Really? He's working out? - Yes.

568
00:24:36,343 --> 00:24:37,444
Wait. I...

569
00:24:38,273 --> 00:24:40,974
I want to see him work out.

570
00:24:43,043 --> 00:24:45,283
So you don't know much about his romantic relationships?

571
00:24:45,783 --> 00:24:47,183
- No. - I wanted to get some Intel.

572
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,684
(Yong Woo and Ju Yeon come back home.)

573
00:24:51,123 --> 00:24:53,053
- They're back. - They're back.

574
00:25:02,394 --> 00:25:03,533
(Blowing out)

575
00:25:04,063 --> 00:25:06,163
(Drawing a heart)

576
00:25:06,164 --> 00:25:07,273
He drew a nice heart.

577
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:08,974
He's good at that.

578
00:25:10,773 --> 00:25:12,673
(Yong Woo is in a good mood.)

579
00:25:12,674 --> 00:25:15,014
(That night)

580
00:25:15,414 --> 00:25:17,644
Right. On weekdays...

581
00:25:18,714 --> 00:25:19,754
That startled me.

582
00:25:22,783 --> 00:25:24,654
Gather up!

583
00:25:25,283 --> 00:25:26,293
What?

584
00:25:28,424 --> 00:25:29,454
Oh, my.

585
00:25:30,023 --> 00:25:33,533
(What kind of event awaits them today?)

586
00:25:33,964 --> 00:25:35,694
"You can reveal your age..."

587
00:25:36,404 --> 00:25:37,664
"now."

588
00:25:38,434 --> 00:25:39,703
- Gosh. - Their age?

589
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:41,203
- They can finally reveal their age. - It's time.

590
00:25:41,204 --> 00:25:42,503
- I'm curious about their age. - I'm so curious.

591
00:25:42,504 --> 00:25:43,904
I'm really curious about their age.

592
00:25:44,103 --> 00:25:47,714
"You can reveal your age now."

593
00:25:50,414 --> 00:25:51,519
- We'll reveal our age. - No way.

594
00:25:51,543 --> 00:25:53,552
- This is crazy. - It's finally time.

595
00:25:53,553 --> 00:25:55,553
- At last. - Gosh, our age?

596
00:25:56,184 --> 00:25:58,254
We suddenly ended up revealing our age.

597
00:25:58,523 --> 00:25:59,923
After this, I could address people...

598
00:25:59,924 --> 00:26:01,693
properly based on their age now.

599
00:26:01,694 --> 00:26:02,799
This would make things easier.

600
00:26:02,823 --> 00:26:04,023
I thought it was finally time.

601
00:26:04,623 --> 00:26:06,023
I was really curious about his age.

602
00:26:06,293 --> 00:26:08,233
Jae Hyung kept acting like he was on the older side.

603
00:26:08,234 --> 00:26:10,503
In the beginning, I really thought he was younger than me.

604
00:26:10,504 --> 00:26:13,234
But considering that he's an accountant,

605
00:26:13,404 --> 00:26:14,802
he might not be that young.

606
00:26:14,803 --> 00:26:17,203
Given his looks, I doubted that he could be in his 30s.

607
00:26:17,204 --> 00:26:18,244
I was puzzled.

608
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:22,413
I was happy that my curiosity about their age would be satisfied,

609
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,843
but I was worried at the same time.

610
00:26:25,244 --> 00:26:26,630
I just thought our age was different.

611
00:26:26,654 --> 00:26:28,184
It would be the best if he was older.

612
00:26:28,313 --> 00:26:30,460
I thought Se Seung and I would be around the same age...

613
00:26:30,484 --> 00:26:32,052
or we might even be the same age.

614
00:26:32,053 --> 00:26:33,533
If not, she might be younger than me.

615
00:26:33,694 --> 00:26:36,823
I was like, "I'll finally reveal my age now."

616
00:26:37,863 --> 00:26:39,694
I thought she and I would be the same age...

617
00:26:39,964 --> 00:26:42,363
or we might be 1 or 2 years apart.

618
00:26:42,563 --> 00:26:45,033
I didn't want to reveal my age forever.

619
00:26:45,964 --> 00:26:49,974
How should I put it? I became conscious of Yun Jae's reaction.

620
00:26:50,944 --> 00:26:52,803
I've never dated an older woman.

621
00:26:54,543 --> 00:26:55,713
- It's our age. - Gosh.

622
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:57,490
Why are my palms getting sweaty all of a sudden?

623
00:26:57,514 --> 00:26:59,382
- Why is that? - Let's do it in a fun way.

624
00:26:59,383 --> 00:27:00,383
Right.

625
00:27:00,384 --> 00:27:02,882
Let's try to sit in the order from youngest to oldest...

626
00:27:02,883 --> 00:27:03,923
based on your guesses.

627
00:27:03,924 --> 00:27:05,484
- We should sit down in order? - Yes.

628
00:27:05,984 --> 00:27:07,700
- In the order of our age? - That spot is for the youngest.

629
00:27:07,724 --> 00:27:08,923
- This is for the youngest? - This spot is for the oldest.

630
00:27:08,924 --> 00:27:10,484
- This way? It'll go clockwise? - Okay.

631
00:27:10,823 --> 00:27:12,793
- The youngest... - Let's guess then.

632
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:17,704
(For some reason, everyone looks at one person.)

633
00:27:19,533 --> 00:27:20,573
The youngest...

634
00:27:20,773 --> 00:27:22,303
- Youngest, come on. Go. - Wait.

635
00:27:22,533 --> 00:27:23,572
Jung Sub. What are you doing?

636
00:27:23,573 --> 00:27:25,403
- Give her your seat. - Come here, Ju Yeon.

637
00:27:25,404 --> 00:27:26,413
- Okay. - Yes.

638
00:27:26,414 --> 00:27:27,514
It has to be her.

639
00:27:27,773 --> 00:27:28,812
She might not be the youngest.

640
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,083
- It might not be her. - Right.

641
00:27:31,543 --> 00:27:34,112
Jae Hyung, you should sit somewhere over there.

642
00:27:34,113 --> 00:27:35,583
- Me? Right. Around there. - Gosh.

643
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:38,583
Wait. I think I'm older than Yun Jae.

644
00:27:38,783 --> 00:27:41,052
- Yun Jae's age is iffy. - I think I'm older than Yun Jae.

645
00:27:41,053 --> 00:27:42,053
Right.

646
00:27:44,994 --> 00:27:46,323
(Getting up)

647
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:48,394
This chair is uncomfortable.

648
00:27:49,863 --> 00:27:50,863
I should go here.

649
00:27:52,063 --> 00:27:53,073
Big brother, Yong Woo!

650
00:27:53,633 --> 00:27:54,633
Big brother, Yong Woo!

651
00:27:54,634 --> 00:27:56,744
- Go ahead. Talk. - Gosh.

652
00:27:57,474 --> 00:27:58,872
I thought we'd be the same age.

653
00:27:58,873 --> 00:27:59,873
- Really? - Right.

654
00:28:00,543 --> 00:28:02,744
- Really? The same age? - I got a feeling. Yes.

655
00:28:03,343 --> 00:28:04,484
This must be it.

656
00:28:04,843 --> 00:28:06,323
- I think we might be right. - You...

657
00:28:06,414 --> 00:28:07,414
Like this?

658
00:28:08,553 --> 00:28:09,984
Should we reveal our age then?

659
00:28:11,783 --> 00:28:12,783
I am...

660
00:28:13,823 --> 00:28:15,792
I'm getting nervous. Why am I getting nervous?

661
00:28:15,793 --> 00:28:18,563
- I'm getting so nervous. - Yes, I'm getting nervous.

662
00:28:19,293 --> 00:28:20,493
I was born in 1999.

663
00:28:20,494 --> 00:28:21,934
- I knew it. - Nice to meet you all.

664
00:28:24,204 --> 00:28:26,434
Then can't he go first?

665
00:28:26,704 --> 00:28:27,734
Right.

666
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:29,803
I think I'm sitting in the right spot.

667
00:28:30,144 --> 00:28:31,343
It's comfortable here.

668
00:28:31,704 --> 00:28:33,174
Should I just say my age?

669
00:28:34,014 --> 00:28:35,043
Year 1996.

670
00:28:35,273 --> 00:28:37,244
Right. I was born in 1996.

671
00:28:38,444 --> 00:28:39,444
Really?

672
00:28:39,954 --> 00:28:41,930
- Nice to meet you, my friend. - You were born in 1996, right?

673
00:28:41,954 --> 00:28:43,082
Gosh, Se Seung.

674
00:28:43,083 --> 00:28:44,583
They're the same age?

675
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:47,063
- He's the same age as Se Seung. - They're the same age.

676
00:28:47,994 --> 00:28:48,994
Really?

677
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,870
- Nice to meet you, my friend. - You were born in 1996, right?

678
00:28:51,894 --> 00:28:54,332
- Really? Both of you? - I had a feeling she was.

679
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:55,393
- I told you. - Right.

680
00:28:55,394 --> 00:28:56,903
- I told you. - I had a feeling she was.

681
00:28:56,904 --> 00:28:58,003
He sensed that I was born in 1996.

682
00:28:58,004 --> 00:28:59,734
They're the same age too?

683
00:28:59,803 --> 00:29:02,773
The two of them seemed to click well.

684
00:29:02,873 --> 00:29:05,403
If they're the same age on top of that,

685
00:29:05,404 --> 00:29:07,612
I thought their chemistry would be better.

686
00:29:07,613 --> 00:29:08,873
I was surprised by that.

687
00:29:09,573 --> 00:29:12,984
I thought I would be able to bond and feel more at ease around her.

688
00:29:13,214 --> 00:29:14,934
My interest in her went up all of a sudden.

689
00:29:20,293 --> 00:29:23,093
- I bet Ji Won was born in 1994. - In 1994.

690
00:29:23,823 --> 00:29:25,293
- I... - In the early 1994.

691
00:29:25,823 --> 00:29:27,063
I was born...

692
00:29:27,934 --> 00:29:29,164
- Yes? - in 1995.

693
00:29:32,004 --> 00:29:33,004
Really?

694
00:29:36,133 --> 00:29:37,144
Then...

695
00:29:39,204 --> 00:29:41,543
(Yun Jae and Ji Won are only one year apart.)

696
00:29:44,184 --> 00:29:45,313
I was born in 1994.

697
00:29:45,883 --> 00:29:46,914
Year 1994.

698
00:29:49,924 --> 00:29:51,224
- Which month? - January.

699
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:53,052
- Then we should switch. - You should switch.

700
00:29:53,053 --> 00:29:54,053
Gosh.

701
00:29:54,323 --> 00:29:55,853
- Right. - This is it.

702
00:29:56,023 --> 00:29:58,623
I was also born in 1994.

703
00:29:58,724 --> 00:30:00,124
- Year 1994. - You're the same age.

704
00:30:03,333 --> 00:30:04,363
Is it my turn?

705
00:30:04,603 --> 00:30:06,233
- I don't even have a clue. - Seriously.

706
00:30:06,234 --> 00:30:07,602
- I thought he could be young too. - Right.

707
00:30:07,603 --> 00:30:09,132
- He looked older and younger. - Right.

708
00:30:09,133 --> 00:30:10,143
- Right. - Yes.

709
00:30:10,144 --> 00:30:12,144
I was born in 1991.

710
00:30:13,644 --> 00:30:16,204
- That's sort of in the middle. - We should circle around first.

711
00:30:17,343 --> 00:30:19,043
I knew it. I could feel it.

712
00:30:19,813 --> 00:30:21,713
- No wonder I felt close to him. - I see.

713
00:30:21,714 --> 00:30:23,484
But the gap between them...

714
00:30:23,924 --> 00:30:25,654
What's this gap?

715
00:30:25,754 --> 00:30:26,852
You guys have no idea.

716
00:30:26,853 --> 00:30:29,623
- Right. - They're only a year apart.

717
00:30:29,823 --> 00:30:31,664
(Staring)

718
00:30:33,863 --> 00:30:35,493
Yun Ha, it's time to get up.

719
00:30:35,494 --> 00:30:36,964
I should get up now.

720
00:30:37,563 --> 00:30:38,602
- Get up now. - I...

721
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:39,603
Wait. Are you...

722
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:41,303
- Go over there. - Are you older than me?

723
00:30:41,704 --> 00:30:43,802
- Gosh. - There must be a twist coming.

724
00:30:43,803 --> 00:30:45,342
- Really? - Is she older than Yong Woo?

725
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,073
How old is she?

726
00:30:47,343 --> 00:30:48,644
- Go over there. - Guess my age.

727
00:30:48,813 --> 00:30:51,683
What? I think she should switch with the three of them.

728
00:30:51,684 --> 00:30:54,154
- I... - I think she should come here.

729
00:30:57,754 --> 00:30:59,123
- Between us. - Right.

730
00:30:59,623 --> 00:31:00,822
If they're only six years apart...

731
00:31:00,823 --> 00:31:01,853
Year 1990?

732
00:31:02,593 --> 00:31:04,862
- Year 1990? - Well,

733
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,023
I was born in 1989.

734
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:08,434
- Go and sit over there. - Were you born in 1990?

735
00:31:08,934 --> 00:31:10,134
- Sit over there. - Seriously.

736
00:31:10,734 --> 00:31:11,734
Gosh. Really?

737
00:31:11,735 --> 00:31:13,602
- Really? She looks so young. - She's the oldest? Right.

738
00:31:13,603 --> 00:31:14,603
- Right. - She looks younger than her age.

739
00:31:14,604 --> 00:31:16,132
- She looks much younger. - She looks younger than her age.

740
00:31:16,133 --> 00:31:17,504
I thought she was in her 20s.

741
00:31:17,744 --> 00:31:20,143
I think Yun Jae is a bit flustered.

742
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:21,343
I was born in 1989.

743
00:31:21,474 --> 00:31:22,713
Gosh. Really?

744
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:23,882
- Go and sit over there. - Were you born in 1990?

745
00:31:23,883 --> 00:31:24,913
- Yes. - Sit over there.

746
00:31:24,914 --> 00:31:27,034
- You can sit there. - Seriously. She looks so young.

747
00:31:28,113 --> 00:31:29,683
- You can sit there. - Seriously. She looks so young.

748
00:31:29,684 --> 00:31:31,684
- You can make yourself comfortable. - Sure.

749
00:31:32,553 --> 00:31:34,623
- My goodness. - Thank you.

750
00:31:34,924 --> 00:31:36,663
- Really? - I didn't see that coming.

751
00:31:36,664 --> 00:31:39,063
- Yun Ha, you should move closer. - I see.

752
00:31:40,533 --> 00:31:42,593
Yun Jae was born in 1994.

753
00:31:42,863 --> 00:31:45,063
Then we're five years apart.

754
00:31:46,603 --> 00:31:49,333
I thought that he might not like me.

755
00:31:50,704 --> 00:31:52,243
- Gosh. - Right.

756
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:54,414
- You're so far away. - It's okay.

757
00:31:55,843 --> 00:31:57,383
- It's okay? - Yes.

758
00:32:01,654 --> 00:32:04,883
He rarely dated women who were older than him.

759
00:32:05,353 --> 00:32:07,423
I didn't have to look at my brother...

760
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:10,394
to feel that he was slightly flustered.

761
00:32:10,894 --> 00:32:14,592
I kept feeling that vibe from him when we were sitting down.

762
00:32:14,593 --> 00:32:16,733
But I wanted to talk to him...

763
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:21,833
to see if her age would affect his interest in her.

764
00:32:23,073 --> 00:32:26,303
To be honest, I was quite surprised when I found out about Yun Ha's age.

765
00:32:26,744 --> 00:32:31,514
There was a big gap between the age I had in mind and her actual age.

766
00:32:39,484 --> 00:32:42,423
See? Revealing your age...

767
00:32:42,424 --> 00:32:43,763
can be beneficial to some people...

768
00:32:43,764 --> 00:32:45,994
- and disadvantageous to some. - Right.

769
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:47,664
- That's a bummer. - Right.

770
00:32:48,093 --> 00:32:49,964
If I were him, I would've thought like this.

771
00:32:50,103 --> 00:32:52,003
"It's time for me to date an older woman."

772
00:32:52,004 --> 00:32:53,980
- That would cross my mind. - That's what you'd think. Right.

773
00:32:54,004 --> 00:32:55,204
Gosh. What's going to happen?

774
00:32:55,404 --> 00:32:56,842
If I were him,

775
00:32:56,843 --> 00:32:59,343
I would've started a new restaurant called Cello-Fed Meat.

776
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,073
Cello-Fed Pigs. You know?

777
00:33:01,514 --> 00:33:02,612
How is that possible?

778
00:33:02,613 --> 00:33:03,842
- No, listen. - You mean the cello music?

779
00:33:03,843 --> 00:33:05,382
- Pigs listened to the cello music. - I see.

780
00:33:05,383 --> 00:33:07,082
Then the meat will be tenderer.

781
00:33:07,083 --> 00:33:08,382
- That must be a thing. - That's a great idea.

782
00:33:08,383 --> 00:33:09,612
- Pigs listening to music. - Right.

783
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:11,122
- Right. - Is that a real thing?

784
00:33:11,123 --> 00:33:12,423
- Yes. Pigs listening to music... - Right.

785
00:33:12,424 --> 00:33:14,153
- Their meat gets softer. - That's great. Cello Pig.

786
00:33:14,154 --> 00:33:15,154
- Music... - Is that a real thing?

787
00:33:15,155 --> 00:33:16,352
People become flexible when they dance.

788
00:33:16,353 --> 00:33:17,923
So pigs that listen to music will be tender.

789
00:33:17,924 --> 00:33:18,924
Of course.

790
00:33:18,925 --> 00:33:20,963
One of the pigs can hold the cello at the entrance.

791
00:33:20,964 --> 00:33:23,504
And the other pig can hold up the pork belly.

792
00:33:24,464 --> 00:33:25,602
- Great. - I've never heard that before.

793
00:33:25,603 --> 00:33:27,163
That's bound to be a famous restaurant.

794
00:33:28,504 --> 00:33:30,004
What's Cho A's age?

795
00:33:30,273 --> 00:33:32,043
Right. I'm so curious about Cho A's age.

796
00:33:34,273 --> 00:33:35,813
Cho A...

797
00:33:36,883 --> 00:33:38,984
- We're the same age. - Really?

798
00:33:39,313 --> 00:33:40,612
(Surprised)

799
00:33:40,613 --> 00:33:41,613
Really?

800
00:33:41,614 --> 00:33:44,184
- She's older than Yong Woo. - Only by a year.

801
00:33:44,754 --> 00:33:46,894
- We're the same age. - Really?

802
00:33:47,754 --> 00:33:48,954
Really?

803
00:33:49,323 --> 00:33:51,099
- Nice to meet you, my friend. - Move closer then.

804
00:33:51,123 --> 00:33:52,523
- I... - You know...

805
00:33:52,863 --> 00:33:54,092
I may address her...

806
00:33:54,093 --> 00:33:56,363
differently after finding out about her age.

807
00:33:56,494 --> 00:33:58,233
I didn't think her age would be an issue.

808
00:33:59,233 --> 00:34:01,974
My age didn't seem to throw Yong Woo off.

809
00:34:02,334 --> 00:34:04,774
I thought he was older than me.

810
00:34:06,673 --> 00:34:08,712
I'm still interested in him.

811
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:11,513
But I don't want him to address me as an older woman.

812
00:34:11,514 --> 00:34:14,414
Well, we're only a year apart. So that's not an age difference.

813
00:34:14,954 --> 00:34:16,514
But it still felt a bit iffy.

814
00:34:16,823 --> 00:34:18,224
Well, Yong Woo is...

815
00:34:18,524 --> 00:34:22,253
past the point that age actually matters for him.

816
00:34:22,423 --> 00:34:23,894
I doubt it would change his mind.

817
00:34:24,423 --> 00:34:26,994
Cho A and my sister are the same age.

818
00:34:27,363 --> 00:34:28,363
No way.

819
00:34:28,593 --> 00:34:30,434
I thought she would be younger than my sister.

820
00:34:30,633 --> 00:34:32,033
I was really shocked.

821
00:34:33,604 --> 00:34:35,373
- You look younger than your age. - So...

822
00:34:35,374 --> 00:34:36,903
We finally revealed our age.

823
00:34:39,303 --> 00:34:40,343
Hey, big brothers.

824
00:34:41,713 --> 00:34:43,473
I had a feeling that you'd be older than me.

825
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,984
Could you not address me like that?

826
00:34:45,914 --> 00:34:47,790
- It feels weirder for me. - Should I address Big Sis?

827
00:34:47,814 --> 00:34:49,314
- That's better. - Big Sis is nice.

828
00:34:49,414 --> 00:34:51,224
- That suits you. - Big Sis is better.

829
00:34:51,954 --> 00:34:53,993
They don't want to be addressed as older women.

830
00:34:53,994 --> 00:34:55,294
Do women really hate that?

831
00:34:55,753 --> 00:34:56,962
I'm curious about that.

832
00:34:56,963 --> 00:34:58,192
- Because it makes them look old? - Do you not like that?

833
00:34:58,193 --> 00:34:59,723
Do you not like it when guys address you like that?

834
00:34:59,724 --> 00:35:00,834
Isn't that better?

835
00:35:01,394 --> 00:35:04,164
- If there's romantic interest. - Romantic interest.

836
00:35:04,334 --> 00:35:05,403
How does he look?

837
00:35:07,434 --> 00:35:08,874
- I see. - It changes based on that?

838
00:35:08,974 --> 00:35:10,574
Can't I decide after I look at his face?

839
00:35:10,974 --> 00:35:12,402
What if Yong Woo addresses you as an older woman?

840
00:35:12,403 --> 00:35:14,363
- Gosh, that doesn't matter. - For some reason...

841
00:35:14,814 --> 00:35:16,274
He can call me Mom.

842
00:35:16,983 --> 00:35:19,443
He can call me Mom. I'm okay with that.

843
00:35:20,084 --> 00:35:22,414
- Really? - Mommy.

844
00:35:23,184 --> 00:35:25,084
- Is that a bit too much? - Mommy.

845
00:35:25,783 --> 00:35:26,823
Han Mommy.

846
00:35:27,593 --> 00:35:28,994
Han Mommy?

847
00:35:29,193 --> 00:35:30,624
I thought you were older than me.

848
00:35:31,394 --> 00:35:33,323
- You're one year apart. - Yes.

849
00:35:34,064 --> 00:35:35,264
I think I became...

850
00:35:35,494 --> 00:35:37,604
friends with everyone here regardless of our age.

851
00:35:37,934 --> 00:35:39,603
- Don't you agree? - Right.

852
00:35:39,604 --> 00:35:41,003
I definitely felt that here.

853
00:35:42,673 --> 00:35:44,604
I stubbornly said that I wasn't the youngest.

854
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:46,773
- I'm the youngest. - So I thought...

855
00:35:46,774 --> 00:35:49,073
Jae Hyung would be sitting right next to Ju Yeon.

856
00:35:49,943 --> 00:35:51,083
- Really? - Yes.

857
00:35:51,084 --> 00:35:52,842
I was ready to drop the honorifics.

858
00:35:52,843 --> 00:35:54,013
I thought you were younger than me.

859
00:35:54,014 --> 00:35:56,383
You thought you would be say, "Hey, let's be good."

860
00:35:57,783 --> 00:35:59,624
Jae Hyung, you look younger than your age.

861
00:36:00,294 --> 00:36:01,322
- I'll go. - Gosh.

862
00:36:01,323 --> 00:36:03,299
- I'll go since I'm the youngest. - The youngest? Okay.

863
00:36:03,323 --> 00:36:05,564
- The youngest is quite polite. - Go ahead.

864
00:36:05,923 --> 00:36:07,232
I wanted to boss her around so badly.

865
00:36:07,233 --> 00:36:08,764
"Ju Yeon. Hurry up."

866
00:36:08,994 --> 00:36:10,163
- Ju Yeon. - Yes, that's going to happen.

867
00:36:10,164 --> 00:36:11,884
- Ju Yeon. You're still sitting? - Ju Yeon.

868
00:36:14,334 --> 00:36:15,603
- I'll open it. - Yes.

869
00:36:15,604 --> 00:36:16,633
Okay.

870
00:36:17,044 --> 00:36:18,244
I should respect my elders.

871
00:36:18,604 --> 00:36:19,973
- Elders? - You should.

872
00:36:19,974 --> 00:36:21,172
- Do you want to read it, Cho A? - No.

873
00:36:21,173 --> 00:36:22,213
Give it to her.

874
00:36:23,213 --> 00:36:24,514
(Surprised)

875
00:36:25,544 --> 00:36:26,544
What is it?

876
00:36:26,954 --> 00:36:29,053
(Puzzled)

877
00:36:29,314 --> 00:36:30,883
Read it now, please.

878
00:36:31,153 --> 00:36:32,153
No way.

879
00:36:32,153 --> 00:36:33,153
- What is it? - I'm curious.

880
00:36:33,154 --> 00:36:34,993
- What is it? - There's one more card in the back.

881
00:36:34,994 --> 00:36:37,223
- What is it? - I'm so curious.

882
00:36:37,224 --> 00:36:39,264
- Please read it now. - Look at her face.

883
00:36:40,693 --> 00:36:42,794
"You're going to Singapore on a trip."

884
00:36:44,003 --> 00:36:45,462
- Really? - What about us?

885
00:36:45,463 --> 00:36:46,834
Singapore... Are we going too?

886
00:36:47,774 --> 00:36:49,232
- We should go too! - Are we going to Singapore too?

887
00:36:49,233 --> 00:36:50,743
- This... - We should watch this in Singapore.

888
00:36:50,744 --> 00:36:51,842
Are we going too?

889
00:36:51,843 --> 00:36:53,243
Here's why. We must move our studio.

890
00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:54,413
To match the location, Singapore.

891
00:36:54,414 --> 00:36:56,442
When we open our eyes, will we be in Singapore too?

892
00:36:56,443 --> 00:36:58,543
No wonder. They told us to bring two outfits.

893
00:36:58,544 --> 00:36:59,644
Right.

894
00:37:00,314 --> 00:37:02,753
- I'm so envious. - They're so lucky.

895
00:37:03,454 --> 00:37:05,584
"You're going to Singapore on a trip."

896
00:37:08,323 --> 00:37:09,922
- Singapore? That's crazy. - I've never been there.

897
00:37:09,923 --> 00:37:11,993
We were going to Singapore on a trip?

898
00:37:11,994 --> 00:37:13,764
I didn't see it coming at all.

899
00:37:13,994 --> 00:37:14,994
Gosh, Singapore?

900
00:37:14,995 --> 00:37:18,334
It's so cold and dry in Korea.

901
00:37:18,463 --> 00:37:21,133
We'll be going to a hot and humid country.

902
00:37:21,374 --> 00:37:22,454
That made my heart flutter.

903
00:37:33,783 --> 00:37:36,303
Is this for real? Is it possible to have so much fun like this?

904
00:37:36,613 --> 00:37:38,354
I guess we came here for this moment.

905
00:37:43,124 --> 00:37:45,623
Personally, I don't have any memories...

906
00:37:45,624 --> 00:37:47,339
of spending time with my significant other abroad.

907
00:37:47,363 --> 00:37:48,993
Since it's a new territory, I'm looking forward to it.

908
00:37:48,994 --> 00:37:53,032
We'll be spending days together from start to finish.

909
00:37:53,033 --> 00:37:54,033
I thought that...

910
00:37:54,034 --> 00:37:56,532
there might be some changes with my current feelings.

911
00:37:56,533 --> 00:37:58,293
How is it possible we're going to Singapore?

912
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:01,474
That was just unbelievable.

913
00:38:11,753 --> 00:38:13,752
So we were going to Singapore,

914
00:38:13,753 --> 00:38:15,423
but there was a catch.

915
00:38:16,153 --> 00:38:18,692
"With the chance to pick your partner..."

916
00:38:18,693 --> 00:38:21,164
"for your journey to Singapore and local dates,"

917
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:24,362
"the very first Duet Contest with Siblings..."

918
00:38:24,363 --> 00:38:25,403
"will be held."

919
00:38:26,733 --> 00:38:29,334
- Gosh. That sounds so fun. - Seriously.

920
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:32,073
I bet deep down, Jae Hyung is feeling so motivated.

921
00:38:32,374 --> 00:38:33,403
Right?

922
00:38:34,173 --> 00:38:35,943
"Are we doing this contest for me?"

923
00:38:36,343 --> 00:38:37,943
- "Is it time to show them?" - Right.

924
00:38:38,613 --> 00:38:39,859
- Get ready to sing Yada's song. - He'll be ready.

925
00:38:39,883 --> 00:38:42,552
"The very first Duet Contest with Siblings..."

926
00:38:42,553 --> 00:38:43,553
"will be held."

927
00:38:44,983 --> 00:38:45,983
"It will take place..."

928
00:38:45,983 --> 00:38:46,983
(It will take place tomorrow night.)

929
00:38:46,984 --> 00:38:48,153
I'm kind of shocked.

930
00:38:49,193 --> 00:38:50,793
"The five pairs of siblings should go to separate locations..."

931
00:38:50,794 --> 00:38:52,393
"as provided below."

932
00:38:52,394 --> 00:38:54,592
"Pick the song you will sing at the contest tomorrow."

933
00:38:54,593 --> 00:38:56,434
"And work out the practice schedule."

934
00:38:57,164 --> 00:38:59,663
- What's at stake? - The chance to pick your date.

935
00:38:59,664 --> 00:39:01,774
You get to pick your date.

936
00:39:01,803 --> 00:39:02,873
"Jae Hyung and Se Seung."

937
00:39:02,874 --> 00:39:04,149
"Go to Se Seung's room on the second floor."

938
00:39:04,173 --> 00:39:06,180
"Yong Woo and Ju Yeon. Go to the table on the first floor."

939
00:39:06,204 --> 00:39:08,089
"Yun Jae and Ji Won. Go to the table in the basement."

940
00:39:08,113 --> 00:39:09,113
"Yun Ha and Jung Sub."

941
00:39:09,114 --> 00:39:10,342
- "Sofa on the first floor." - Okay.

942
00:39:10,343 --> 00:39:12,743
"Cho A and Cheol Hyeon. Go to the sofa on the second floor."

943
00:39:13,314 --> 00:39:15,954
I just thought, "I'm doomed."

944
00:39:16,253 --> 00:39:18,024
It's self-explanatory. I was doomed.

945
00:39:18,283 --> 00:39:19,553
When I looked around,

946
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:21,693
all of us had the same look.

947
00:39:23,193 --> 00:39:25,593
I rarely went to karaoke rooms these days. I was in trouble.

948
00:39:25,963 --> 00:39:29,093
And since we have to sing a duet, it gave me more pressure.

949
00:39:29,434 --> 00:39:31,733
To be honest, I rarely sing duets.

950
00:39:33,233 --> 00:39:35,604
A duet with her? Gosh.

951
00:39:35,774 --> 00:39:37,802
The first thing I thought was, "I'm doomed."

952
00:39:37,803 --> 00:39:40,914
I heard that Jae Hyung was a great singer.

953
00:39:41,343 --> 00:39:43,013
I thought maybe, my brother and I should try to win...

954
00:39:43,014 --> 00:39:44,713
Hard Work Recognition Award.

955
00:39:45,044 --> 00:39:46,683
Jae Hyung definitely has an advantage.

956
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:47,882
- Right. - Right.

957
00:39:47,883 --> 00:39:49,652
- No. - If you think that way,

958
00:39:49,653 --> 00:39:50,923
it'd be too easy.

959
00:39:51,124 --> 00:39:53,382
I might be under pressure to perform well.

960
00:39:53,383 --> 00:39:55,752
When I went on a date with Ju Yeon, we went to the karaoke room.

961
00:39:55,753 --> 00:39:56,893
Given the history,

962
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:58,574
people might have high expectations of me.

963
00:39:59,164 --> 00:40:00,564
I didn't want to do a sloppy job.

964
00:40:00,693 --> 00:40:03,033
I wanted to prepare thoroughly for this contest.

965
00:40:03,463 --> 00:40:05,164
I thought I was in big trouble.

966
00:40:06,133 --> 00:40:09,733
But I would be able to listen to Jae Hyung's singing,

967
00:40:10,173 --> 00:40:11,204
so I was happy.

968
00:40:11,343 --> 00:40:12,803
Many thoughts crossed my mind.

969
00:40:13,544 --> 00:40:15,774
How do you plan to rank the performances?

970
00:40:16,014 --> 00:40:18,584
What if there are judges from "Superstar K?"

971
00:40:19,244 --> 00:40:21,724
When a judge presses the button, the judge's chair would turn.

972
00:40:22,854 --> 00:40:25,224
"I couldn't help it." They would say stuff like that.

973
00:40:26,923 --> 00:40:28,253
What if we see judges like that?

974
00:40:28,693 --> 00:40:30,593
Oh, my gosh.

975
00:40:31,024 --> 00:40:32,693
(Sighing)

976
00:40:34,093 --> 00:40:35,532
"Once you've selected your song,"

977
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:37,132
"send us the title of the song."

978
00:40:37,133 --> 00:40:40,032
- All right. - Go to your spots now.

979
00:40:40,033 --> 00:40:41,033
- You all understood that, right? - Now?

980
00:40:41,034 --> 00:40:42,433
- Yes. Are we staying here? - Pardon?

981
00:40:42,434 --> 00:40:43,649
- We have the basement. - We're not looking.

982
00:40:43,673 --> 00:40:45,503
Where are we going? Ji Won.

983
00:40:46,073 --> 00:40:47,073
Hey.

984
00:40:47,213 --> 00:40:48,713
- We're going down? - Yes.

985
00:40:48,874 --> 00:40:50,683
The door... Is anyone else coming down?

986
00:40:50,684 --> 00:40:52,343
- No. Close the door. - No? Okay.

987
00:40:53,983 --> 00:40:56,954
(Yun Jae and Ji Won, the table in the basement)

988
00:40:57,983 --> 00:40:59,454
(Sighing)

989
00:40:59,823 --> 00:41:02,454
(As he's frustrated, he picks up a can of beer.)

990
00:41:03,153 --> 00:41:04,963
- Did you only bring yours? - What?

991
00:41:05,524 --> 00:41:09,393
Seriously. You still have a lot to learn.

992
00:41:09,394 --> 00:41:10,463
Do you want to drink too?

993
00:41:11,233 --> 00:41:12,764
I wasn't going to drink tonight.

994
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:15,003
Given what just happened, we can't help but drink.

995
00:41:15,104 --> 00:41:17,173
Exactly. Why do we have to sing?

996
00:41:18,003 --> 00:41:19,043
(Sighing)

997
00:41:19,044 --> 00:41:20,044
Gosh, singing...

998
00:41:20,544 --> 00:41:22,073
Duets.

999
00:41:23,474 --> 00:41:24,514
George and LYn.

1000
00:41:25,113 --> 00:41:27,483
- LYn? I can't sing like her. - This song has a low key.

1001
00:41:27,584 --> 00:41:29,954
We have no choice. We must sing to win.

1002
00:41:30,354 --> 00:41:31,652
I guess you want to win.

1003
00:41:31,653 --> 00:41:32,653
Of course.

1004
00:41:32,783 --> 00:41:34,224
(Surprised)

1005
00:41:34,494 --> 00:41:35,822
You know, we should just give up.

1006
00:41:35,823 --> 00:41:37,152
(If you were to win, whom do you want to pick as your date?)

1007
00:41:37,153 --> 00:41:38,724
I want to use it on Yun Ha.

1008
00:41:39,093 --> 00:41:42,963
A part of me thought that I should win this contest.

1009
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:45,333
I did think that it would be nice...

1010
00:41:45,334 --> 00:41:47,533
if I were to have a chance to pick my date.

1011
00:41:47,704 --> 00:41:51,473
Jae Hyung is the only one I haven't had the chance to talk to.

1012
00:41:51,474 --> 00:41:52,773
If I were to win,

1013
00:41:52,774 --> 00:41:54,814
I would want to use it on Jae Hyung.

1014
00:41:55,044 --> 00:41:56,564
"Things I’d Like to Do With My Lover."

1015
00:41:56,644 --> 00:41:58,244
We can't win with that kind of song.

1016
00:41:59,044 --> 00:42:00,084
Right.

1017
00:42:00,883 --> 00:42:02,482
"Scars Deeper Than Love."

1018
00:42:02,483 --> 00:42:04,684
Hey, don't even think about singing Lena Park's song.

1019
00:42:05,053 --> 00:42:06,753
"How Can I Love the Heartbreak?"

1020
00:42:06,854 --> 00:42:08,193
I can't sing AKMU's song.

1021
00:42:08,624 --> 00:42:09,752
"For When You Are in My Heart?"

1022
00:42:09,753 --> 00:42:11,393
That's a Sung Si Kyung song. It's hard.

1023
00:42:11,394 --> 00:42:12,623
How about "Don't go today?

1024
00:42:12,624 --> 00:42:14,362
It's by Im Se Jun and Ben.

1025
00:42:14,363 --> 00:42:16,064
Let me give you a no right away.

1026
00:42:16,394 --> 00:42:18,063
You told me to sing a song by LYn,

1027
00:42:18,064 --> 00:42:19,933
but you can't sing these songs either.

1028
00:42:19,934 --> 00:42:20,934
I can't help it.

1029
00:42:20,935 --> 00:42:22,935
When we sing as a duet, it can be a lot different.

1030
00:42:23,173 --> 00:42:26,703
I don't love you

1031
00:42:26,704 --> 00:42:28,843
"I don't love you?" on a dating show?

1032
00:42:29,113 --> 00:42:30,572
"Farewell Under the Sun?"

1033
00:42:30,573 --> 00:42:31,644
Hey!

1034
00:42:32,613 --> 00:42:34,983
There's not a good song for a duet.

1035
00:42:35,213 --> 00:42:36,454
Does it have to be a duet song?

1036
00:42:36,983 --> 00:42:38,383
Can't we just sing separately?

1037
00:42:40,483 --> 00:42:41,523
Duet...

1038
00:42:41,524 --> 00:42:43,229
(Yong Woo and Ju Yeon at the table on the 1st floor)

1039
00:42:43,253 --> 00:42:45,463
By the way, I don't think...

1040
00:42:46,394 --> 00:42:47,994
it's going to be easy.

1041
00:42:51,604 --> 00:42:53,104
As soon as I read it,

1042
00:42:53,463 --> 00:42:55,172
- I thought of a song. - What is it?

1043
00:42:55,173 --> 00:42:57,073
- But it's a hard song. - What?

1044
00:42:57,343 --> 00:42:59,244
- We're Lees. - Yes.

1045
00:42:59,874 --> 00:43:01,914
The members of AKMU are also Lees.

1046
00:43:02,314 --> 00:43:04,183
Okay, so?

1047
00:43:04,184 --> 00:43:06,382
- I thought of "Love Lee." - "Love Lee?"

1048
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:07,882
It's a nice song to listen to,

1049
00:43:07,883 --> 00:43:09,712
but if you tried to sing it, it'd be hard.

1050
00:43:09,713 --> 00:43:10,753
Neoguri?

1051
00:43:12,454 --> 00:43:13,882
- Exactly! - Neoguri?

1052
00:43:13,883 --> 00:43:16,152
- Didn't you say "Neoguri?" - I love Neoguri.

1053
00:43:16,153 --> 00:43:18,293
- Me too. - I'd eat it if we had it.

1054
00:43:18,294 --> 00:43:20,193
- Me too, Yong Woo. - Yes.

1055
00:43:20,963 --> 00:43:22,363
Shall we have Neoguri together?

1056
00:43:22,894 --> 00:43:24,174
They say they'll sing "Neoguri."

1057
00:43:25,434 --> 00:43:27,402
- But this song isn't right. - Right.

1058
00:43:27,403 --> 00:43:29,109
The vibe of the song doesn't really match ours.

1059
00:43:29,133 --> 00:43:31,672
AKMU... What else could we sing?

1060
00:43:31,673 --> 00:43:33,802
Let's emphasize our strength.

1061
00:43:33,803 --> 00:43:37,113
The biggest difference between us and other siblings is...

1062
00:43:37,314 --> 00:43:39,383
- that we really look alike. - Yes.

1063
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:42,213
There's a song called "You Resemble Me" by Im Chang Jung.

1064
00:43:42,383 --> 00:43:43,982
(Yong Woo and Ju Yeon's theme song)

1065
00:43:43,983 --> 00:43:46,053
Is it funny?

1066
00:43:47,394 --> 00:43:49,723
I like it. I love the title already.

1067
00:43:49,724 --> 00:43:50,923
Why don't you play it?

1068
00:43:51,624 --> 00:43:53,064
("You Resemble Me" by Im Chang Jung)

1069
00:43:53,264 --> 00:43:55,833
(You resemble me)

1070
00:43:55,834 --> 00:43:59,803
(You're not perfect)

1071
00:44:01,204 --> 00:44:02,303
It's perfect.

1072
00:44:03,934 --> 00:44:06,343
It is, and...

1073
00:44:08,843 --> 00:44:10,543
"My past stained with regrets."

1074
00:44:10,544 --> 00:44:11,613
I know the lyrics.

1075
00:44:13,144 --> 00:44:15,783
The next line is the best part.

1076
00:44:17,854 --> 00:44:19,783
I'm hurt

1077
00:44:20,184 --> 00:44:23,752
(My past)

1078
00:44:23,753 --> 00:44:27,532
(And your present)

1079
00:44:27,533 --> 00:44:30,394
(Are the same)

1080
00:44:31,334 --> 00:44:34,573
(I'm afraid and scared)

1081
00:44:34,974 --> 00:44:37,442
But I don't know this song at all.

1082
00:44:37,443 --> 00:44:40,273
Then sadly, we should drop this.

1083
00:44:40,274 --> 00:44:41,873
(Sadly, they give up "You Resemble Me.")

1084
00:44:41,874 --> 00:44:43,113
Other than this...

1085
00:44:43,414 --> 00:44:44,943
We can dance, so...

1086
00:44:45,483 --> 00:44:46,514
Stop.

1087
00:44:46,644 --> 00:44:49,153
- What if I'm in charge of singing, - Stop...

1088
00:44:49,914 --> 00:44:51,483
and you dance?

1089
00:44:52,783 --> 00:44:53,823
But...

1090
00:44:53,883 --> 00:44:57,124
(Ju Yeon is writing something down.)

1091
00:44:57,294 --> 00:44:58,793
- You like this. - Yes.

1092
00:44:58,794 --> 00:45:00,764
I know the choreography.

1093
00:45:01,434 --> 00:45:03,763
So you want to do this version?

1094
00:45:03,764 --> 00:45:05,532
You have to participate, though.

1095
00:45:05,533 --> 00:45:07,703
Let's leave it as a candidate...

1096
00:45:07,704 --> 00:45:08,834
and keep thinking.

1097
00:45:09,834 --> 00:45:10,974
They're going to dance.

1098
00:45:11,704 --> 00:45:14,613
(Suddenly feeling anxious)

1099
00:45:15,113 --> 00:45:16,514
Do you want to play the cello?

1100
00:45:19,613 --> 00:45:20,684
Or...

1101
00:45:21,414 --> 00:45:22,883
A TVXQ song?

1102
00:45:24,584 --> 00:45:27,253
(Jung Sub played the part of Yunho in high school.)

1103
00:45:29,494 --> 00:45:32,894
Even if I get hurt, It's okay

1104
00:45:32,994 --> 00:45:34,393
(Vocalizing)

1105
00:45:34,394 --> 00:45:37,164
You want me

1106
00:45:37,264 --> 00:45:38,303
That's good.

1107
00:45:38,764 --> 00:45:40,802
(You go crazy for me)

1108
00:45:40,803 --> 00:45:43,303
(You can't get out of me)

1109
00:45:43,803 --> 00:45:44,803
That would be cool.

1110
00:45:44,804 --> 00:45:46,773
(He's still got it.)

1111
00:45:46,774 --> 00:45:47,814
How about this?

1112
00:45:48,173 --> 00:45:51,113
I'd make a fool of myself.

1113
00:45:51,283 --> 00:45:52,883
Let's just give up, then.

1114
00:45:54,814 --> 00:45:56,514
What do I do about my age?

1115
00:45:56,684 --> 00:45:58,354
This could be good.

1116
00:45:59,153 --> 00:46:00,653
What should I do about my age?

1117
00:46:02,423 --> 00:46:03,423
I was shocked.

1118
00:46:03,424 --> 00:46:05,794
You said he'd be older than me.

1119
00:46:06,193 --> 00:46:08,732
Right. I did say that.

1120
00:46:08,733 --> 00:46:09,862
(Do you think Yun Jae is shocked?)

1121
00:46:09,863 --> 00:46:11,334
- Why? - Because of me.

1122
00:46:12,164 --> 00:46:14,064
After our ages were revealed,

1123
00:46:14,173 --> 00:46:15,834
I felt pressure.

1124
00:46:16,204 --> 00:46:19,143
I asked Jung Sub...

1125
00:46:19,144 --> 00:46:21,374
how he thought Yun Jae reacted to it.

1126
00:46:22,073 --> 00:46:23,173
Why would he be shocked?

1127
00:46:23,613 --> 00:46:25,213
It could be a little shocking.

1128
00:46:25,314 --> 00:46:27,914
Well, it could be.

1129
00:46:28,283 --> 00:46:29,454
- Right? - You're right.

1130
00:46:30,253 --> 00:46:32,124
- Five years apart. - Yes.

1131
00:46:33,124 --> 00:46:34,192
(The age gap between Yun Jae and her gives her a lot to think about.)

1132
00:46:34,193 --> 00:46:35,224
This is not fun.

1133
00:46:36,923 --> 00:46:39,994
(Someone else is also deep in thought.)

1134
00:46:40,193 --> 00:46:42,994
I'm a little shocked to learn about his age.

1135
00:46:43,434 --> 00:46:44,633
- Really? - Yes.

1136
00:46:44,963 --> 00:46:47,502
I thought Yong Woo would be older than me.

1137
00:46:47,503 --> 00:46:48,503
I see.

1138
00:46:48,774 --> 00:46:50,732
But I thought he was born in 1989.

1139
00:46:50,733 --> 00:46:52,303
- Really? - Yes.

1140
00:46:52,644 --> 00:46:54,274
Why did I think he'd be much older?

1141
00:46:54,713 --> 00:46:56,814
That means he's very mature.

1142
00:46:57,314 --> 00:46:59,414
To be honest, the age gap is only 1 or 2 years.

1143
00:46:59,783 --> 00:47:01,783
I like it. He's older than me.

1144
00:47:02,014 --> 00:47:03,453
- I love it. - You have an older brother now.

1145
00:47:03,454 --> 00:47:05,883
I kind of expected him to be older than me.

1146
00:47:07,553 --> 00:47:10,553
- We all wanted different things. - I hoped he was older.

1147
00:47:12,224 --> 00:47:13,564
It's really a bummer.

1148
00:47:14,294 --> 00:47:15,834
No one was older than me.

1149
00:47:17,434 --> 00:47:20,532
- I never thought of what to sing. - Me neither.

1150
00:47:20,533 --> 00:47:23,373
I don't go to karaoke often either.

1151
00:47:23,374 --> 00:47:25,044
- Me neither. - So...

1152
00:47:25,774 --> 00:47:28,043
What? You guys are talking here?

1153
00:47:28,044 --> 00:47:29,044
Yes.

1154
00:47:29,173 --> 00:47:31,282
- Did you discuss it in that room? - Yes.

1155
00:47:31,283 --> 00:47:33,243
They're the main performers, then.

1156
00:47:33,244 --> 00:47:34,313
(The main performers of this singing contest)

1157
00:47:34,314 --> 00:47:35,382
- Our singing was good. - Yes.

1158
00:47:35,383 --> 00:47:37,854
(Taking out his guitar)

1159
00:47:38,124 --> 00:47:39,983
Oh, dear. He took out his guitar.

1160
00:47:40,253 --> 00:47:42,954
Jae Hyung and his sister really have an edge.

1161
00:47:43,053 --> 00:47:45,563
- We must beat Jae Hyung. - Beat Jae Hyung?

1162
00:47:45,564 --> 00:47:47,934
Jae Hyung will win anyway.

1163
00:47:47,994 --> 00:47:49,064
I know.

1164
00:47:49,593 --> 00:47:52,033
(His singing ability is already well-known.)

1165
00:47:52,334 --> 00:47:54,774
(So is his dancing ability.)

1166
00:47:55,874 --> 00:47:59,302
(They already sang as a duet 22 years ago.)

1167
00:47:59,303 --> 00:48:00,543
(August 8, 2002)

1168
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:04,073
(Music is life to him.)

1169
00:48:05,244 --> 00:48:08,153
It'd be nice to have the right to select my date.

1170
00:48:08,553 --> 00:48:10,413
I wanted to nail it,

1171
00:48:10,414 --> 00:48:11,614
so I gave it a lot of thought.

1172
00:48:12,124 --> 00:48:14,253
(Jae Hyung and Se Seung in the women's room upstairs)

1173
00:48:14,553 --> 00:48:17,323
We can't win...

1174
00:48:17,664 --> 00:48:18,994
just by doing well.

1175
00:48:19,394 --> 00:48:20,593
We must have something more.

1176
00:48:20,963 --> 00:48:23,493
It should be touching and fun.

1177
00:48:23,494 --> 00:48:24,633
Then...

1178
00:48:25,033 --> 00:48:27,263
How about "I to You, You to Me" by Jatanpung?

1179
00:48:27,264 --> 00:48:29,374
How can we sing this as a duet?

1180
00:48:29,774 --> 00:48:32,503
("I to You, You to Me" by Jatanpung)

1181
00:48:32,704 --> 00:48:34,464
Should I play the guitar while singing this?

1182
00:48:34,744 --> 00:48:37,073
(Playing the guitar)

1183
00:48:40,014 --> 00:48:44,883
(It becomes a beautiful memory)

1184
00:48:46,454 --> 00:48:48,294
Shall we try "The Blue in You?"

1185
00:48:49,423 --> 00:48:51,223
- And... - Is there a guitar version of that?

1186
00:48:51,593 --> 00:48:53,764
"The Blue in You" would be too predictable.

1187
00:48:54,294 --> 00:48:55,334
What is that song?

1188
00:48:55,963 --> 00:48:58,664
"The Blue in You?" It's like a national duet song.

1189
00:48:59,133 --> 00:49:01,333
This seems to be our only choice with the time we have.

1190
00:49:01,374 --> 00:49:02,974
- It's not that bad. - Right.

1191
00:49:03,533 --> 00:49:05,342
From what I think,

1192
00:49:05,343 --> 00:49:07,673
some of them are good singers, but...

1193
00:49:07,713 --> 00:49:09,874
What if Ji Won does something wild?

1194
00:49:10,213 --> 00:49:12,283
What if she does a windmill and a head spin?

1195
00:49:12,914 --> 00:49:13,983
She'd go like...

1196
00:49:21,624 --> 00:49:24,053
Let me tell you certain moves.

1197
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:27,264
Do you think you can copy them?

1198
00:49:28,963 --> 00:49:30,592
Actually,

1199
00:49:30,593 --> 00:49:33,402
- this is everyone's favourite song. - Right.

1200
00:49:33,403 --> 00:49:34,802
I'll add a JYP vibe to it.

1201
00:49:34,803 --> 00:49:37,073
(This song is given a JYP vibe in its reinterpretation.)

1202
00:49:38,874 --> 00:49:40,374
Let's do that version, then.

1203
00:49:43,673 --> 00:49:44,744
You're good at it.

1204
00:49:48,414 --> 00:49:50,334
- Do you think I can do it? - It's not that bad.

1205
00:49:50,613 --> 00:49:51,782
I'll have a crazy look in my eyes.

1206
00:49:51,783 --> 00:49:53,282
I won't try to dance well.

1207
00:49:53,283 --> 00:49:54,894
I'll do it in my own style.

1208
00:49:55,093 --> 00:49:57,223
I'd just lose myself since I already gave up trying to dance well.

1209
00:49:57,224 --> 00:49:58,664
Just make sure to do that part well.

1210
00:50:01,564 --> 00:50:03,193
(Sighing)

1211
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:07,533
I want to die.

1212
00:50:08,633 --> 00:50:09,673
Somebody, kill me.

1213
00:50:09,903 --> 00:50:11,903
Just kill me.

1214
00:50:13,573 --> 00:50:15,572
I kept thinking about what to sing...

1215
00:50:15,573 --> 00:50:17,782
with my young little sister.

1216
00:50:17,783 --> 00:50:20,483
Then we decided that I should sing and she should dance.

1217
00:50:20,584 --> 00:50:21,983
That's why we chose "Hype Boy."

1218
00:50:23,053 --> 00:50:25,183
Trust the warmth inside

1219
00:50:25,184 --> 00:50:26,664
There's karaoke open in the basement.

1220
00:50:26,854 --> 00:50:29,724
(Yun Jae and Ji Won in the basement karaoke)

1221
00:50:30,323 --> 00:50:33,264
Like yesterday

1222
00:50:33,664 --> 00:50:37,532
The reazons why you leave me

1223
00:50:37,533 --> 00:50:38,704
"Reazons?"

1224
00:50:39,503 --> 00:50:40,863
- Reazons. - Reazons.

1225
00:50:41,834 --> 00:50:43,433
- Reazons. - Why did he pronounce it like that?

1226
00:50:43,434 --> 00:50:45,074
- He tries to sound a little cool. - Yes.

1227
00:50:45,274 --> 00:50:46,274
Reazons!

1228
00:50:46,974 --> 00:50:50,942
The reazons why you leave me

1229
00:50:50,943 --> 00:50:52,014
"Reazons?"

1230
00:50:52,283 --> 00:50:54,783
- Reazons. - My voice hasn't warmed up yet.

1231
00:50:55,014 --> 00:50:57,212
- How about "Aloha?" - I can't sing a Lee Jae Hoon song.

1232
00:50:57,213 --> 00:50:59,083
"When Love Comes" by Park Hyo Shin?

1233
00:50:59,084 --> 00:51:01,423
- That's a hard song. - You can't sing any song well.

1234
00:51:02,553 --> 00:51:03,753
You can't sing any song.

1235
00:51:04,323 --> 00:51:06,293
We must be the siblings...

1236
00:51:06,294 --> 00:51:08,763
that had the most difficulties in choosing a song.

1237
00:51:08,764 --> 00:51:10,763
I think we had different ideas.

1238
00:51:10,764 --> 00:51:14,002
My brother used to do vocal music.

1239
00:51:14,003 --> 00:51:17,502
He once dreamed of becoming a singer as well,

1240
00:51:17,503 --> 00:51:19,373
so he takes pride...

1241
00:51:19,374 --> 00:51:22,143
in his singing ability.

1242
00:51:22,144 --> 00:51:24,342
He would have thought...

1243
00:51:24,343 --> 00:51:26,643
it was a good opportunity to show his charm.

1244
00:51:26,644 --> 00:51:30,183
He seemed to want to win the right to choose his date too.

1245
00:51:30,184 --> 00:51:32,782
"I'll show them who I am."

1246
00:51:32,783 --> 00:51:35,723
He seemed to have this mindset.

1247
00:51:35,724 --> 00:51:37,994
That must be why we had a conflict.

1248
00:51:38,093 --> 00:51:40,163
(This)

1249
00:51:40,164 --> 00:51:42,362
(Might not be love)

1250
00:51:42,363 --> 00:51:46,463
(Proud of his singing ability)

1251
00:51:46,704 --> 00:51:47,704
(Laughing)

1252
00:51:47,704 --> 00:51:48,704
(Gasping)

1253
00:51:48,705 --> 00:51:50,232
My heart hurts

1254
00:51:50,233 --> 00:51:51,403
This is too high.

1255
00:51:51,803 --> 00:51:53,302
I should've warmed up my voice.

1256
00:51:53,303 --> 00:51:54,914
You didn't have to do that.

1257
00:51:55,374 --> 00:51:56,874
It wouldn't be raspy, at least.

1258
00:51:57,644 --> 00:51:59,213
We're doomed.

1259
00:52:00,343 --> 00:52:01,514
"Twenty-Five, Twenty-One?"

1260
00:52:02,283 --> 00:52:03,783
"Twenty-Five, Twenty-One."

1261
00:52:03,914 --> 00:52:07,083
- Is a Jaurim song okay? - Yes. I'm fine with it.

1262
00:52:07,084 --> 00:52:09,052
("Twenty-Five, Twenty-One" by Jaurim)

1263
00:52:09,053 --> 00:52:15,394
(The song of that day is carried by the wind)

1264
00:52:15,794 --> 00:52:17,394
(Flinching)

1265
00:52:18,963 --> 00:52:24,403
- I thought it'd last forever - I thought it'd last forever

1266
00:52:24,604 --> 00:52:28,514
- You in the past - Did you have to sing with me?

1267
00:52:29,943 --> 00:52:31,213
You come in here.

1268
00:52:31,783 --> 00:52:35,353
- Your scent - Lower your tone.

1269
00:52:35,354 --> 00:52:39,223
- It's carried by the wind - Okay. That's good.

1270
00:52:39,224 --> 00:52:41,183
You have to use chest voice here anyway.

1271
00:52:41,184 --> 00:52:43,223
(Vocalizing)

1272
00:52:43,224 --> 00:52:44,569
You can make it sound stronger, right?

1273
00:52:44,593 --> 00:52:46,724
I thought it'd last forever

1274
00:52:46,863 --> 00:52:51,533
- Twenty-five, twenty-one - Twenty-five, twenty-one

1275
00:52:52,033 --> 00:52:55,033
Let me sing the first chorus alone since it's calm.

1276
00:52:55,303 --> 00:53:01,414
(Your scent)

1277
00:53:01,713 --> 00:53:06,414
(Is carried by the wind)

1278
00:53:08,653 --> 00:53:14,223
(I thought it'd last forever)

1279
00:53:14,224 --> 00:53:18,524
Twenty-five, twenty-one

1280
00:53:20,963 --> 00:53:23,192
Let's go with this for now.

1281
00:53:23,193 --> 00:53:25,663
I'll come up with a guide.

1282
00:53:25,664 --> 00:53:26,732
Listen.

1283
00:53:26,733 --> 00:53:28,532
Let's say we won the right to choose our dates.

1284
00:53:28,533 --> 00:53:30,033
Let's say we came in first.

1285
00:53:30,334 --> 00:53:31,694
Who are you going to choose, then?

1286
00:53:32,003 --> 00:53:34,544
(Silent)

1287
00:53:35,474 --> 00:53:37,234
Do you want to think about it after you win?

1288
00:53:38,843 --> 00:53:39,882
Okay.

1289
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:42,353
I didn't want to win for some reason...

1290
00:53:42,354 --> 00:53:44,112
because I would have to choose someone as my date.

1291
00:53:44,113 --> 00:53:45,423
Jung Sub would be my choice,

1292
00:53:45,883 --> 00:53:47,624
but I didn't want to choose him.

1293
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:49,823
I don't know why I feel this way.

1294
00:53:49,923 --> 00:53:53,064
It'd be funny if we changed the lyrics.

1295
00:53:53,164 --> 00:53:54,164
To be honest, you're right.

1296
00:53:54,165 --> 00:53:55,363
- Right? - Yes.

1297
00:53:57,294 --> 00:53:59,363
Things only siblings can do

1298
00:54:00,533 --> 00:54:01,802
- I love that. - Right?

1299
00:54:01,803 --> 00:54:02,833
We wanted to do something cute...

1300
00:54:02,834 --> 00:54:06,543
and choose something that would suit us.

1301
00:54:06,544 --> 00:54:09,173
So we chose "Nagging" by IU in the end.

1302
00:54:09,874 --> 00:54:12,914
- It sounds like siblings bickering. - Right.

1303
00:54:13,914 --> 00:54:15,084
"Let's stop?"

1304
00:54:15,354 --> 00:54:17,253
- We should change that part. - Okay.

1305
00:54:17,753 --> 00:54:19,233
How about "Let's cut each other off?"

1306
00:54:19,383 --> 00:54:21,023
I like that idea.

1307
00:54:21,024 --> 00:54:23,294
Cutting each other off? That sounds good?

1308
00:54:25,164 --> 00:54:27,494
Should we ask ChatGPT to write the lyrics?

1309
00:54:29,233 --> 00:54:30,264
Please.

1310
00:54:30,894 --> 00:54:33,132
- A duet song. - One candle under the lights

1311
00:54:33,133 --> 00:54:34,163
I like this song.

1312
00:54:34,164 --> 00:54:36,573
It warms my heart.

1313
00:54:37,133 --> 00:54:38,373
One promise

1314
00:54:38,374 --> 00:54:39,573
Let's sing that, then.

1315
00:54:39,843 --> 00:54:43,673
(With my unchanging love)

1316
00:54:44,744 --> 00:54:48,382
The siblings will sing a song together as a duet.

1317
00:54:48,383 --> 00:54:52,224
We didn't think it was our chance to show off our charm.

1318
00:54:53,024 --> 00:54:54,083
"Let's just go with the flow."

1319
00:54:54,084 --> 00:54:56,192
I remember listening to the song...

1320
00:54:56,193 --> 00:54:58,592
when I took a trip with my sister.

1321
00:54:58,593 --> 00:55:02,163
I could relate to most of the lyrics as well.

1322
00:55:02,164 --> 00:55:03,263
I love how the song is...

1323
00:55:03,264 --> 00:55:05,032
about "We rely on each other" and "I trust you."

1324
00:55:05,033 --> 00:55:08,803
That's why we chose the song right away.

1325
00:55:08,974 --> 00:55:13,173
(All siblings chose their songs.)

1326
00:55:14,673 --> 00:55:16,243
What song did you choose?

1327
00:55:16,244 --> 00:55:18,314
- "Twenty-Five, Twenty-One." - A Jaurim song?

1328
00:55:19,443 --> 00:55:22,152
I can't wait to find out what Jae Hyung will sing.

1329
00:55:22,153 --> 00:55:23,153
I know.

1330
00:55:24,613 --> 00:55:26,183
(This song has already been requested.)

1331
00:55:26,184 --> 00:55:27,184
(Would you like to compete?)

1332
00:55:27,185 --> 00:55:28,830
Someone already requested it. Do you want to compete with them?

1333
00:55:28,854 --> 00:55:29,854
What?

1334
00:55:29,855 --> 00:55:31,354
It's been requested already.

1335
00:55:31,593 --> 00:55:33,564
- What? - Did someone choose it?

1336
00:55:34,494 --> 00:55:35,692
Did you choose "Twenty-Five, Twenty-One?"

1337
00:55:35,693 --> 00:55:36,934
It was them.

1338
00:55:37,533 --> 00:55:38,533
Let's avoid that.

1339
00:55:38,534 --> 00:55:39,962
- Apologize to them. - They chose the same song.

1340
00:55:39,963 --> 00:55:41,002
We had similar vibes in mind.

1341
00:55:41,003 --> 00:55:42,873
- Was it us? - We chose the same one.

1342
00:55:42,874 --> 00:55:43,933
- We chose the same song. - I got goosebumps.

1343
00:55:43,934 --> 00:55:46,073
- Seriously. - Jae Hyung!

1344
00:55:46,604 --> 00:55:48,643
- Jae Hyung! - That's insanely cute.

1345
00:55:48,644 --> 00:55:50,143
Jae Hyung, come down quickly!

1346
00:55:50,144 --> 00:55:52,113
- Jae Hyung, it's us. - What?

1347
00:55:52,213 --> 00:55:55,183
We chose the same song as the doppelgänger siblings.

1348
00:55:55,184 --> 00:55:56,583
- This is not good. - Oh, dear.

1349
00:55:56,584 --> 00:55:57,782
- We were going for the same vibe. - Is that so?

1350
00:55:57,783 --> 00:55:58,953
- I was worried about this. - We should change it.

1351
00:55:58,954 --> 00:56:00,823
Since Jae Hyung chose it, we have to give up.

1352
00:56:01,454 --> 00:56:04,552
My first thought was, "They were ahead of us."

1353
00:56:04,553 --> 00:56:06,422
We gave up immediately.

1354
00:56:06,423 --> 00:56:07,623
We can take our time.

1355
00:56:07,624 --> 00:56:09,434
They told us to send them our first choice.

1356
00:56:14,533 --> 00:56:16,073
Did you receive a text yesterday?

1357
00:56:16,934 --> 00:56:18,203
(Shaking her head)

1358
00:56:18,204 --> 00:56:19,244
I see.

1359
00:56:20,644 --> 00:56:22,643
I was quite upset yesterday.

1360
00:56:22,644 --> 00:56:25,014
Everyone was upset yesterday.

1361
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:28,953
It turned out there was a lot of misunderstanding between us.

1362
00:56:28,954 --> 00:56:31,653
- Really? - He thought I fell for Yong Woo.

1363
00:56:32,053 --> 00:56:33,253
I see.

1364
00:56:33,684 --> 00:56:36,192
If I want to be nice...

1365
00:56:36,193 --> 00:56:38,322
to him this much,

1366
00:56:38,323 --> 00:56:41,592
I try to be less nice to other guys.

1367
00:56:41,593 --> 00:56:42,593
Right.

1368
00:56:42,994 --> 00:56:44,564
I'm trying to do that.

1369
00:56:44,764 --> 00:56:47,833
But that thought confused me even more.

1370
00:56:47,834 --> 00:56:49,533
It just gave me a headache.

1371
00:56:49,774 --> 00:56:52,203
When a man is extra kind to a woman...

1372
00:56:52,204 --> 00:56:54,603
compared to other women,

1373
00:56:54,604 --> 00:56:56,613
- it often has a big impact on her. - Yes.

1374
00:56:56,843 --> 00:56:59,083
But men...

1375
00:56:59,084 --> 00:57:01,813
Especially, my brother is not affected by that.

1376
00:57:01,814 --> 00:57:02,953
- Really? - Yes.

1377
00:57:02,954 --> 00:57:04,782
He said he gets really jealous.

1378
00:57:04,783 --> 00:57:06,053
Well, he is...

1379
00:57:06,653 --> 00:57:07,923
I didn't know that.

1380
00:57:09,724 --> 00:57:11,293
I have this thought.

1381
00:57:11,294 --> 00:57:13,723
He might not necessarily be my other half,

1382
00:57:13,724 --> 00:57:15,064
but I feel like we're soulmates.

1383
00:57:16,233 --> 00:57:20,232
If we start dating and define us as a couple,

1384
00:57:20,233 --> 00:57:23,573
that relationship might end at some point.

1385
00:57:24,033 --> 00:57:27,443
I'm already afraid of that.

1386
00:57:27,874 --> 00:57:30,842
- You thought about it that far? - Yes. I think we really click.

1387
00:57:30,843 --> 00:57:34,143
I feel like I'm already past the point...

1388
00:57:34,144 --> 00:57:38,323
where I should figure out how I feel about him.

1389
00:57:38,454 --> 00:57:39,483
What do you mean?

1390
00:57:39,653 --> 00:57:42,653
Since we'll keep seeing each other,

1391
00:57:43,124 --> 00:57:45,192
I can't stop having feelings for him...

1392
00:57:45,193 --> 00:57:46,362
at this point.

1393
00:57:46,363 --> 00:57:48,593
- You're past that point? - Yes.

1394
00:57:48,733 --> 00:57:49,934
I already...

1395
00:57:50,934 --> 00:57:55,073
I feel like I already got quite attached.

1396
00:57:55,334 --> 00:57:58,503
I don't know. This is already so hard.

1397
00:57:59,604 --> 00:58:03,343
I feel like it's getting more and more complicated.

1398
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:07,584
Why? How did your mind change?

1399
00:58:08,613 --> 00:58:11,084
My heart is only inclined to him...

1400
00:58:11,283 --> 00:58:14,224
because I was only interested in him.

1401
00:58:14,524 --> 00:58:16,753
I was 100 percent into him and 0 percent into others.

1402
00:58:18,923 --> 00:58:20,462
But now...

1403
00:58:20,463 --> 00:58:22,994
I feel like I'm a little into this guy.

1404
00:58:23,994 --> 00:58:25,633
It's such a random point.

1405
00:58:26,764 --> 00:58:27,963
I'm so curious.

1406
00:58:28,064 --> 00:58:29,673
- What? - Who?

1407
00:58:31,073 --> 00:58:33,244
- Who is it? - Really? Who?

1408
00:58:37,173 --> 00:58:38,243
- Yun Jae? - Yun Jae?

1409
00:58:38,244 --> 00:58:39,414
Yun Jae?

1410
00:58:41,343 --> 00:58:43,514
- What are you two doing? - Hey.

1411
00:58:43,854 --> 00:58:45,152
We're having a serious conversation.

1412
00:58:45,153 --> 00:58:46,713
What? A serious conversation? Goodness.

1413
00:58:50,093 --> 00:58:51,093
Take a guess.

1414
00:58:52,193 --> 00:58:53,593
Is it Yun Jae?

1415
00:58:54,193 --> 00:58:55,264
No, right?

1416
00:58:55,434 --> 00:58:57,494
I have no idea.

1417
00:59:01,264 --> 00:59:02,273
Oh, dear.

1418
00:59:02,274 --> 00:59:03,303
Yong Woo!

1419
00:59:07,744 --> 00:59:08,973
- I didn't see that coming. - This is so much fun!

1420
00:59:08,974 --> 00:59:10,072
But...

1421
00:59:10,073 --> 00:59:11,413
- How can she be suddenly into him? - She can express...

1422
00:59:11,414 --> 00:59:12,643
Well, it's possible.

1423
00:59:12,644 --> 00:59:15,183
As they spent more time together, she started to see...

1424
00:59:15,184 --> 00:59:16,212
good traits of his and got into him.

1425
00:59:16,213 --> 00:59:18,953
She just didn't realize it because of Jung Sub.

1426
00:59:18,954 --> 00:59:21,753
Her heart was closed to other guys.

1427
00:59:21,994 --> 00:59:23,669
Although she knew Yong Woo was a good person.

1428
00:59:23,693 --> 00:59:24,693
Oh, my. Yong Woo.

1429
00:59:28,533 --> 00:59:29,564
Oh, dear.

1430
00:59:30,093 --> 00:59:31,093
(Surprised)

1431
00:59:31,564 --> 00:59:33,962
You know he's nice. He's a good person all around.

1432
00:59:33,963 --> 00:59:35,503
He only has strengths.

1433
00:59:35,974 --> 00:59:38,373
I always liked him...

1434
00:59:38,374 --> 00:59:40,704
and admired him as a person.

1435
00:59:41,073 --> 00:59:43,514
Since my heart hadn't been open to other guys,

1436
00:59:44,274 --> 00:59:47,283
I suddenly thought I should be...

1437
00:59:47,383 --> 00:59:48,653
with someone like Yong Woo.

1438
00:59:49,153 --> 00:59:50,213
Right.

1439
00:59:50,314 --> 00:59:52,822
Jung Sub and I had a talk,

1440
00:59:52,823 --> 00:59:54,684
and we cleared up our misunderstanding.

1441
00:59:54,783 --> 00:59:58,863
But my heart wasn't fluttering like crazy...

1442
00:59:59,494 --> 01:00:01,423
like it did at the start.

1443
01:00:01,593 --> 01:00:02,839
Did you use to have butterflies around him?

1444
01:00:02,863 --> 01:00:05,533
Yes. I was happy that we straightened things out,

1445
01:00:05,934 --> 01:00:08,503
but my heart wasn't pounding like it did before.

1446
01:00:09,073 --> 01:00:11,704
Then I saw Yong Woo coming down,

1447
01:00:12,073 --> 01:00:13,402
and my eyes kept following him.

1448
01:00:13,403 --> 01:00:15,744
When I like someone, my eyes are fixed on them.

1449
01:00:16,943 --> 01:00:19,084
(Earlier in the evening)

1450
01:00:19,883 --> 01:00:20,942
Are you leaving?

1451
01:00:20,943 --> 01:00:22,953
Gosh, it's Yong Woo. I'm sorry.

1452
01:00:22,954 --> 01:00:24,454
I thought you were my brother.

1453
01:00:24,684 --> 01:00:26,822
- I'm sorry. - Who is it?

1454
01:00:26,823 --> 01:00:29,994
- I'm Se Seung. Hi. - Hi.

1455
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:35,133
Should I say he keeps catching my eye?

1456
01:00:36,334 --> 01:00:37,664
When we were drinking together,

1457
01:00:37,934 --> 01:00:40,934
he told me how he changed your diaper.

1458
01:00:41,434 --> 01:00:43,974
- He talked about that again. - About changing a full diaper.

1459
01:00:44,934 --> 01:00:46,143
And that...

1460
01:00:46,144 --> 01:00:48,513
- Did you like it? - I thought he was cool.

1461
01:00:48,514 --> 01:00:50,773
There were so many moments...

1462
01:00:50,774 --> 01:00:52,913
when I thought he was a good person,

1463
01:00:52,914 --> 01:00:54,414
but I didn't like him romantically.

1464
01:00:54,544 --> 01:00:56,314
I didn't see him that way.

1465
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:58,084
Then when he showed up,

1466
01:00:59,883 --> 01:01:03,823
I realized my heart didn't want only one person.

1467
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:07,993
"He has at least ten percent of my heart."

1468
01:01:07,994 --> 01:01:09,193
That's what I thought.

1469
01:01:10,794 --> 01:01:12,232
But I guess that would be it.

1470
01:01:12,233 --> 01:01:14,503
Yong Woo doesn't seem...

1471
01:01:15,374 --> 01:01:16,502
interested in me at all.

1472
01:01:16,503 --> 01:01:19,003
He seems to be committed to one person.

1473
01:01:20,244 --> 01:01:21,604
I...

1474
01:01:22,044 --> 01:01:24,143
don't grow feelings for the person in that kind of situation.

1475
01:01:24,144 --> 01:01:25,612
I open my heart...

1476
01:01:25,613 --> 01:01:28,282
when the other person gives me certainty first,

1477
01:01:28,283 --> 01:01:30,483
so I don't really fall for someone first.

1478
01:01:30,753 --> 01:01:34,553
I was always the one who liked the person first.

1479
01:01:35,093 --> 01:01:38,024
I guess it's sort of my defence mechanism.

1480
01:01:38,423 --> 01:01:40,624
My heart opens to them when they like me first.

1481
01:01:40,863 --> 01:01:43,532
I want to be like you...

1482
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:45,362
because I tend to find myself...

1483
01:01:45,363 --> 01:01:47,802
reading too much into things later.

1484
01:01:47,803 --> 01:01:49,233
Well, I do that too, though.

1485
01:01:51,033 --> 01:01:52,953
My feelings for Yong Woo might be gone tomorrow.

1486
01:01:53,104 --> 01:01:55,513
Every day is different here,

1487
01:01:55,514 --> 01:01:58,044
and you don't know what will happen tomorrow.

1488
01:02:07,153 --> 01:02:08,894
We should go to sleep soon.

1489
01:02:09,224 --> 01:02:12,363
I wonder what will happen in Singapore.

1490
01:02:12,524 --> 01:02:15,963
- I can't wait. - Lots of things can change.

1491
01:02:16,064 --> 01:02:17,064
It's driving me crazy.

1492
01:02:18,133 --> 01:02:20,032
Will Se Seung...

1493
01:02:20,033 --> 01:02:21,502
be able to sway Yong Woo?

1494
01:02:21,503 --> 01:02:23,273
- But Yong Woo and Cho A are... - It won't be easy.

1495
01:02:23,274 --> 01:02:25,703
Right? She'd be challenging their solid relationship.

1496
01:02:25,704 --> 01:02:28,713
Cho A and Se Seung are completely different.

1497
01:02:29,644 --> 01:02:31,490
And what Cho A and Yong Woo have are really solid.

1498
01:02:31,514 --> 01:02:32,584
(Tapping)

1499
01:02:33,684 --> 01:02:34,843
Give me one.

1500
01:02:35,314 --> 01:02:38,624
It's so funny. This is so interesting.

1501
01:02:43,524 --> 01:02:44,994
- Good night. - Good night.

1502
01:02:47,394 --> 01:02:48,663
Did you finish the book?

1503
01:02:48,664 --> 01:02:50,993
"Words That Are Always Good to Hear."

1504
01:02:50,994 --> 01:02:54,403
I'm halfway through it, but I haven't finished it.

1505
01:02:54,803 --> 01:02:56,072
I'll read that later.

1506
01:02:56,073 --> 01:02:57,233
(Startled)

1507
01:02:57,974 --> 01:02:59,543
- What? - What?

1508
01:02:59,544 --> 01:03:01,043
- What? - What?

1509
01:03:01,044 --> 01:03:04,113
- What? I can't do this? - You suddenly got closer.

1510
01:03:04,974 --> 01:03:06,712
- I can't? - Yes, you can.

1511
01:03:06,713 --> 01:03:08,483
- I'm a pig? - Yes, you can.

1512
01:03:09,113 --> 01:03:11,414
When are you going to sleep? We should go to sleep soon.

1513
01:03:11,613 --> 01:03:12,724
- Tomorrow... - Go to bed.

1514
01:03:12,883 --> 01:03:14,724
- You're not going to sleep? - What?

1515
01:03:15,354 --> 01:03:16,624
Let's go upstairs first.

1516
01:03:19,294 --> 01:03:20,794
Goodness. Look at your lips.

1517
01:03:21,524 --> 01:03:22,593
Let's go upstairs for now.

1518
01:03:22,934 --> 01:03:25,303
Let's go upstairs. We should go to bed quickly.

1519
01:03:25,403 --> 01:03:26,403
Go to bed then.

1520
01:03:27,503 --> 01:03:28,503
Sleep.

1521
01:03:29,934 --> 01:03:30,974
Seriously...

1522
01:03:33,274 --> 01:03:35,913
- What is this girl doing? - Sleep.

1523
01:03:35,914 --> 01:03:37,414
Se Seung was born in 1996.

1524
01:03:40,414 --> 01:03:42,814
- You too. - I know.

1525
01:03:43,084 --> 01:03:45,923
Why does time pass by so quickly? How can we go?

1526
01:03:46,184 --> 01:03:47,524
By airplane.

1527
01:03:47,823 --> 01:03:49,624
Yong Woo will pilot it.

1528
01:03:49,923 --> 01:03:53,422
Caution. Seagulls ahead.

1529
01:03:53,423 --> 01:03:55,294
This is the captain speaking.

1530
01:03:55,863 --> 01:03:58,093
There's a group of seagulls forward.

1531
01:03:58,863 --> 01:04:00,863
Seatbelt, please. Ding.

1532
01:04:01,403 --> 01:04:04,803
What will happen in Singapore?

1533
01:04:04,903 --> 01:04:07,803
For real. It's going to be fun.

(Next morning)

1547
01:05:24,783 --> 01:05:25,903
Do you have any plans today?

1548
01:05:26,423 --> 01:05:28,624
I do. I think I'll come home in the evening.

1549
01:05:29,053 --> 01:05:30,823
We should practice for the contest.

1550
01:05:30,923 --> 01:05:31,923
I know.

1551
01:05:32,664 --> 01:05:34,124
I'm in trouble.

1552
01:05:35,294 --> 01:05:36,463
Did you change the song?

1553
01:05:36,834 --> 01:05:38,493
I'm going to. While my sister is at work,

1554
01:05:38,494 --> 01:05:41,033
I'll change the song with her permission.

1555
01:05:41,963 --> 01:05:44,080
Ji Won is a type who makes sure everything is perfect.

1556
01:05:44,104 --> 01:05:45,104
Right.

1557
01:05:46,244 --> 01:05:47,443
If I send a song as I want,

1558
01:05:48,843 --> 01:05:50,443
my life will be at stake.

1559
01:05:52,443 --> 01:05:53,443
We should sing.

1560
01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:56,212
- My gosh. - What song did you choose again?

1561
01:05:56,213 --> 01:05:58,213
We haven't decided yet.

1562
01:05:58,514 --> 01:06:00,752
I want to do a bright or a fun song.

1563
01:06:00,753 --> 01:06:03,693
But my brother might want to sing a serious song.

1564
01:06:04,193 --> 01:06:05,252
Is that so?

1565
01:06:05,253 --> 01:06:08,794
It seems he really wants to get the right to go on a date.

1566
01:06:09,463 --> 01:06:10,463
Really?

1567
01:06:11,093 --> 01:06:12,663
Everyone in the house, let's eat.

1568
01:06:12,664 --> 01:06:14,163
He made egg-fried rice.

1569
01:06:14,164 --> 01:06:16,902
I was going to sleep, but I had to get up.

1570
01:06:16,903 --> 01:06:18,572
- Really? Because of the smell? - Yes.

1571
01:06:18,573 --> 01:06:19,774
That's so cute.

1572
01:06:21,474 --> 01:06:23,573

1578
01:06:31,214 --> 01:06:33,224
- Seriously... - Why did you come only now?

1579
01:06:33,483 --> 01:06:35,623
- You're a chef. - Chef.

1580
01:06:35,624 --> 01:06:37,822
- Why did you come only now? - Why did you come only now?

1581
01:06:37,823 --> 01:06:39,524
It looks good.

1582
01:06:40,024 --> 01:06:41,862
- Can you make it at home? - He's an amazing cook.

1583
01:06:41,863 --> 01:06:42,933
- I know. - It's Chinese fried rice.

1584
01:06:42,934 --> 01:06:44,493
Yes. It's a Chinese dish.

1585
01:06:44,494 --> 01:06:46,433
I'm envious of those who are good at cooking.

1586
01:06:46,434 --> 01:06:48,703
- I'm so envious. - My food doesn't even smell good.

1587
01:06:48,704 --> 01:06:49,873
How can it smell bad?

1588
01:06:49,874 --> 01:06:50,903
With rice.

1589
01:06:51,374 --> 01:06:52,442
- This is it. - Thank you.

1590
01:06:52,443 --> 01:06:53,743
I'm so excited about the kimchi.

1591
01:06:53,744 --> 01:06:55,473
- I love this. - I'm so happy.

1592
01:06:55,474 --> 01:06:57,419
- Let's eat it right away. - Let's eat it right away.

1593
01:06:57,443 --> 01:06:58,982
It looks so pretty.

1594
01:06:58,983 --> 01:07:00,683
How did he make it so nicely?

1595
01:07:00,684 --> 01:07:02,552
- He's indeed different. - He's different for real.

1596
01:07:02,553 --> 01:07:04,712
Thank you so much for the food.

1597
01:07:04,713 --> 01:07:05,724
Eat.

1598
01:07:05,983 --> 01:07:07,453
- Thank you so much. - It looks delicious.

1599
01:07:07,454 --> 01:07:09,529
- It's too nice to eat. - There weren't many ingredients.

1600
01:07:09,553 --> 01:07:10,823
(Savouring)

1601
01:07:11,794 --> 01:07:13,862
- Oh, my gosh. - This is so good.

1602
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:15,024
This is really good.

1603
01:07:15,224 --> 01:07:16,893
It's seasoned perfectly.

1604
01:07:16,894 --> 01:07:18,462
Yes. Cheol Hyeon...

1605
01:07:18,463 --> 01:07:19,863
- Are you dividing the food? - Yes.

1606
01:07:21,434 --> 01:07:22,633
(Impressed)

1607
01:07:23,903 --> 01:07:26,143
- He's a legendary judging type. - He's different.

1608
01:07:26,144 --> 01:07:28,604
As soon as he moved in,

1609
01:07:28,814 --> 01:07:30,443
- he cleaned up. - He cleaned up.

1610
01:07:31,044 --> 01:07:32,544
- He cleaned everything. - I love it.

1611
01:07:32,644 --> 01:07:34,212
He even threw away the food waste.

1612
01:07:34,213 --> 01:07:35,413
- Right. Yes. - For real?

1613
01:07:35,414 --> 01:07:37,413
I didn't know. Thank you so much.

1614
01:07:37,414 --> 01:07:40,323
(He divides the rice in the rice cooker into portions...)

1615
01:07:41,753 --> 01:07:43,793
(to put it in the fridge.)

1616
01:07:43,794 --> 01:07:45,394
Shall we eat the egg tarts?

1617
01:07:46,463 --> 01:07:48,093
I put them downstairs.

1618
01:07:48,963 --> 01:07:50,462
Why did you put them there?

1619
01:07:50,463 --> 01:07:52,462
They said they needed to be stored in a fridge.

1620
01:07:52,463 --> 01:07:55,434
- Yesterday... - That's awesome.

1621
01:07:56,133 --> 01:07:57,833
You should compliment your brother a lot.

1622
01:07:57,834 --> 01:07:59,603
- That's what I'm saying. - This is so nice.

1623
01:07:59,604 --> 01:08:01,703
- The two of you... - He's a lot sweeter than it seems.

1624
01:08:01,704 --> 01:08:03,043
- We tried it, but it didn't work. - He's sweet?

1625
01:08:03,044 --> 01:08:04,613
- Goodness. - My brother is like that too.

1626
01:08:04,614 --> 01:08:07,242
He doesn't say sweet things either,

1627
01:08:07,243 --> 01:08:09,053
but both of them do sweet things.

1628
01:08:09,284 --> 01:08:11,113
- Cold outside but warm inside. - Right.

1629
01:08:11,114 --> 01:08:13,300
That's why we don't like people who act cold but are sweet.

1630
01:08:13,324 --> 01:08:15,223
We like someone who is blatantly sweet, don't we?

1631
01:08:15,224 --> 01:08:17,122
Yes. Someone who acts cold but is sweet?

1632
01:08:17,123 --> 01:08:19,399
I have a brother who has been like that all my life, so...

1633
01:08:19,423 --> 01:08:21,292
But no one here is like that,

1634
01:08:21,293 --> 01:08:22,434
except for Jae Hyung.

1635
01:08:23,564 --> 01:08:24,939
That's why I don't like that type of person.

1636
01:08:24,963 --> 01:08:27,203
- I'm not attracted to him. - But Jae Hyung...

1637
01:08:27,534 --> 01:08:29,503
doesn't act that cold.

1638
01:08:29,604 --> 01:08:31,534
- He acts cute quite a lot. - Right.

1639
01:08:31,633 --> 01:08:33,803
Let me do the dishes.

1640
01:08:34,343 --> 01:08:35,644
It'll be quicker if I do it.

1641
01:08:35,743 --> 01:08:37,973
- You cooked for us today. - You worked a lot.

1642
01:08:37,974 --> 01:08:39,013
- Yes. - Okay.

1643
01:08:39,014 --> 01:08:40,342
- I'll get going. - See you later.

1644
01:08:40,343 --> 01:08:41,383
Bye.

1645
01:08:41,984 --> 01:08:43,452
- See you later. - Bye.

1646
01:08:43,453 --> 01:08:44,613
See you later.

1647
01:08:44,614 --> 01:08:45,622
(Ji Won goes to work.)

1648
01:08:45,623 --> 01:08:47,753
(That afternoon)

1649
01:08:48,553 --> 01:08:51,154
(A sweet voice is heard on the 2nd floor.)

1650
01:08:51,394 --> 01:08:53,792
Until

1651
01:08:53,793 --> 01:08:56,694
The day

1652
01:08:58,093 --> 01:09:00,693
- When I ask for forgiveness - Are you practicing to win already?

1653
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:02,162
- Gosh. - This won't do.

1654
01:09:02,163 --> 01:09:03,172
I'm so intimidated.

1655
01:09:03,173 --> 01:09:05,103
- Come on. - My gosh.

1656
01:09:05,104 --> 01:09:06,873
I can't stay with him.

1657
01:09:07,074 --> 01:09:10,974
Oh, my

1658
01:09:11,074 --> 01:09:12,514
- See you later. - Bye.

1659
01:09:13,144 --> 01:09:14,284
See you later.

1660
01:09:15,184 --> 01:09:16,784
I haven't memorized the lyrics yet.

1661
01:09:16,883 --> 01:09:18,614
You should memorize the lyrics.

1662
01:09:18,713 --> 01:09:19,953
I couldn't.

1663
01:09:21,184 --> 01:09:22,184
Let's go.

1664
01:09:23,154 --> 01:09:25,764
(Jae Hyung and Se Seung are going to the waiting room.)

1665
01:09:26,394 --> 01:09:29,162
So they don't just do it?

1666
01:09:29,163 --> 01:09:30,163
Is there a stage?

1667
01:09:30,163 --> 01:09:31,163
Aren't they doing it at home?

1668
01:09:31,164 --> 01:09:33,132
- The scale is quite big. - Right.

1669
01:09:33,133 --> 01:09:34,802
(The siblings are checking their stage outfits.)

1670
01:09:34,803 --> 01:09:37,574
I hate it so much.

1671
01:09:38,703 --> 01:09:39,974
It suits you.

1672
01:09:43,173 --> 01:09:45,074
(An all-white look is completed.)

1673
01:09:45,883 --> 01:09:48,543
Do you have sunglasses?

1674
01:09:48,743 --> 01:09:50,063
- Yes. - Make sure to bring them.

1675
01:09:50,614 --> 01:09:51,614
That was it.

1676
01:09:58,053 --> 01:09:59,413
This is it. We'll win the contest.

1677
01:09:59,493 --> 01:10:00,493
We already won.

1678
01:10:01,194 --> 01:10:02,224
After doing this...

1679
01:10:06,333 --> 01:10:08,063
Ju Yeon was having a lot of fun...

1680
01:10:08,064 --> 01:10:09,234
during the process.

1681
01:10:09,333 --> 01:10:12,034
I hoped it would be a good memory for her.

1682
01:10:12,234 --> 01:10:14,644
So I decided to agree with all her ideas.

1683
01:10:15,104 --> 01:10:17,243
I'll sing the first verse. You dance.

1684
01:10:18,444 --> 01:10:19,683
One, two, three, four.

1685
01:10:19,684 --> 01:10:20,743
(Baby)

1686
01:10:20,843 --> 01:10:23,253
(Laughing)

1687
01:10:24,553 --> 01:10:25,684
That's nice.

1688
01:10:26,923 --> 01:10:27,984
(Glancing)

1689
01:10:30,194 --> 01:10:32,963
Trust me, I'm not looking for just one

1690
01:10:33,064 --> 01:10:34,264
(Baby)

1691
01:10:35,024 --> 01:10:36,063
Baby

1692
01:10:36,064 --> 01:10:37,064
(Laughing)

1693
01:10:37,633 --> 01:10:39,713
(As soon as Ji Won goes out, they practice dancing.)

1694
01:10:39,803 --> 01:10:43,173
Because I know what you like, boy

1695
01:10:44,303 --> 01:10:47,873
You're my chemical hype boy

1696
01:10:49,274 --> 01:10:51,673
- You know, I hype you, boy - You know, I hype you, boy

1697
01:10:51,944 --> 01:10:56,453
(They decide on the ending pose as well.)

1698
01:10:56,654 --> 01:10:58,483
- Okay. - Okay.

1699
01:10:58,484 --> 01:11:00,984
I think this would be enough.

1700
01:11:01,984 --> 01:11:04,324
(Yong Woo and Ju Yeon go to the waiting room.)

1701
01:11:04,793 --> 01:11:06,264
I think we're going to win.

1702
01:11:07,163 --> 01:11:08,763
- Do you have a feeling about it? - Yes.

1703
01:11:09,894 --> 01:11:11,563
You got the feeling the moment I wore the hat, right?

1704
01:11:11,564 --> 01:11:13,133
Yes. Immediately.

1705
01:11:13,434 --> 01:11:18,833
(Yun Jae and Ji Won are still choosing a song.)

1706
01:11:19,043 --> 01:11:22,944
I think you're like that

1707
01:11:23,913 --> 01:11:25,673
Am I supposed to sing in falsetto like this?

1708
01:11:25,984 --> 01:11:27,344
Should we change the song quickly?

1709
01:11:27,784 --> 01:11:29,713
What other songs do we have? What do we do?

1710
01:11:29,814 --> 01:11:30,814
"It Would Be Good."

1711
01:11:30,913 --> 01:11:33,183
- It would be good - Sing that part in chest voice.

1712
01:11:33,184 --> 01:11:34,544
- I'll sing in falsetto. - Oh, my.

1713
01:11:35,083 --> 01:11:36,153
Listen to "It Would Be Good."

1714
01:11:36,154 --> 01:11:37,622
(He receives an urgent call.)

1715
01:11:37,623 --> 01:11:39,324
- Good - Hello? Have you arrived?

1716
01:11:39,764 --> 01:11:42,194
- A phone call? - Do they have a guest?

1717
01:11:42,694 --> 01:11:43,934
Who?

1718
01:11:45,293 --> 01:11:47,264
- There's a featuring artist. - Is that possible?

1719
01:11:47,703 --> 01:11:49,673
For real? Are you serious?

1720
01:11:49,974 --> 01:11:52,214
- There might be a featuring artist. - Is that possible?

1721
01:11:52,743 --> 01:11:53,872
Listen to "It Would Be Good."

1722
01:11:53,873 --> 01:11:55,033
(He receives an urgent call.)

1723
01:11:55,203 --> 01:11:56,843
- Good - Hello? Have you arrived?

1724
01:11:58,173 --> 01:11:59,743
All right. I'm going out.

1725
01:12:01,184 --> 01:12:02,184
Gosh.

1726
01:12:03,114 --> 01:12:04,114
Gosh.

1727
01:12:04,115 --> 01:12:05,635
(Yun Jae is going outside with sighs.)

1728
01:12:05,883 --> 01:12:07,984
(An hour ago)

1729
01:12:08,524 --> 01:12:10,824
(Ji Won came home.)

1730
01:12:11,024 --> 01:12:12,354
I'm tired.

1731
01:12:15,324 --> 01:12:16,894
Ji Won, did the tire get flat?

1732
01:12:16,993 --> 01:12:18,463
Yes. The front right one.

1733
01:12:18,833 --> 01:12:20,404
- The front right? - Yes.

1734
01:12:20,633 --> 01:12:23,133
If we can fix the puncture, we can solder it right away.

1735
01:12:23,474 --> 01:12:25,673
No. I think it's completely flat.

1736
01:12:26,444 --> 01:12:27,872
It needs to be towed then.

1737
01:12:27,873 --> 01:12:30,943
It seems the tire stepped on a sharp object.

1738
01:12:30,944 --> 01:12:33,644
I got out to take a look. The tire was flat.

1739
01:12:34,114 --> 01:12:36,912
The car is registered under my brother's name.

1740
01:12:36,913 --> 01:12:39,323
So he called the insurance company.

1741
01:12:39,324 --> 01:12:41,784
He tried to solve the problem.

1742
01:12:41,883 --> 01:12:45,793
Because we didn't have much time until the contest,

1743
01:12:45,894 --> 01:12:47,962
it made him more anxious.

1744
01:12:47,963 --> 01:12:49,734
So I felt very uncomfortable.

1745
01:12:54,803 --> 01:12:55,803
Gosh.

1746
01:13:04,144 --> 01:13:05,944
How did she drive the car here?

1747
01:13:08,284 --> 01:13:10,114
(Sighing)

1748
01:13:12,253 --> 01:13:14,284
Did she drive the car without knowing?

1749
01:13:14,824 --> 01:13:16,194
Gosh.

1750
01:13:16,993 --> 01:13:18,354
I was dumbfounded.

1751
01:13:18,654 --> 01:13:20,540
If the tire became flat, she should've pulled over...

1752
01:13:20,564 --> 01:13:22,122
and called the tow truck,

1753
01:13:22,123 --> 01:13:23,234
but she drove it home.

1754
01:13:23,333 --> 01:13:25,492
So I had to solve the issue.

1755
01:13:25,493 --> 01:13:28,534
I called a tow truck and had the car taken to a repair shop.

1756
01:13:28,734 --> 01:13:30,934
That's when things started getting twisted.

1757
01:13:31,234 --> 01:13:32,404
It was a little tough.

1758
01:13:34,373 --> 01:13:36,614
I should go, though. My goodness.

1759
01:13:37,743 --> 01:13:38,913
Give it a good scratch.

1760
01:13:39,913 --> 01:13:42,593
I should just sing without practice. I don't know the song, though.

1761
01:13:42,654 --> 01:13:44,514
Seriously...

1762
01:13:47,423 --> 01:13:48,452
It's better for you to go to the repair shop.

1763
01:13:48,453 --> 01:13:50,423
Yes. I should.

1764
01:13:51,493 --> 01:13:54,092
I'm in trouble. I think we should change the song.

1765
01:13:54,093 --> 01:13:55,173
I couldn't practice at all.

1766
01:13:55,764 --> 01:13:57,534
Oh, no.

1767
01:13:58,493 --> 01:14:01,502
- He could sing with the lyrics. - Is this a real sitcom documentary?

1768
01:14:01,503 --> 01:14:03,973
It never happened...

1769
01:14:03,974 --> 01:14:04,974
in a dating show, right?

1770
01:14:05,034 --> 01:14:06,042
- My gosh. - Having a car towed.

1771
01:14:06,043 --> 01:14:07,973
They haven't even chosen a song yet.

1772
01:14:07,974 --> 01:14:09,773
- Oh, no. - Oh, no.

1773
01:14:09,774 --> 01:14:11,543
They haven't even chosen a song yet.

1774
01:14:13,083 --> 01:14:16,753
(A waiting room near the concert venue)

1775
01:14:20,354 --> 01:14:22,284
(They're doing a simple practice.)

1776
01:14:23,824 --> 01:14:25,823
(Even your temperature)

1777
01:14:25,824 --> 01:14:28,363
(She's stuck in the phrase.)

1778
01:14:28,364 --> 01:14:30,632
Should I act like I became emotional at this moment?

1779
01:14:30,633 --> 01:14:31,693
(Even your temperature)

1780
01:14:31,694 --> 01:14:32,702
(Sighing)

1781
01:14:32,703 --> 01:14:34,264
Even your body temperature

1782
01:14:34,463 --> 01:14:36,373
- Let's do this. Okay. - All right.

1783
01:14:37,234 --> 01:14:39,394
If I get "even your temperature" right, it'll be okay.

1784
01:14:39,803 --> 01:14:42,542
Let's play the song and practice hard.

1785
01:14:42,543 --> 01:14:44,614
I think the key is trying not too hard...

1786
01:14:44,814 --> 01:14:46,484
- to sound good. - Is that so?

1787
01:14:46,644 --> 01:14:48,943
- I think that's the most difficult. - Right.

1788
01:14:48,944 --> 01:14:50,752
(They aren't trying too hard to sound good.)

1789
01:14:50,753 --> 01:14:51,912
One, two.

1790
01:14:51,913 --> 01:14:53,422
- Under the dim light - Under the dim light

1791
01:14:53,423 --> 01:14:56,093
(They aren't trying too hard to sound good.)

1792
01:14:56,654 --> 01:14:58,323
- A promise - A promise

1793
01:14:58,324 --> 01:15:00,264
- In a wine glass - I think we sang it too high.

1794
01:15:01,194 --> 01:15:02,292
- Should we try again? - Let's do it again.

1795
01:15:02,293 --> 01:15:03,492
Let's eat heartily.

1796
01:15:03,493 --> 01:15:05,863
We made a good choice when ordering the food.

1797
01:15:05,864 --> 01:15:07,733
- Let's eat heartily. - I suddenly feel happy.

1798
01:15:07,734 --> 01:15:09,673
Me too. I suddenly feel happy too.

1799
01:15:09,774 --> 01:15:13,143
Before the food came, we had practiced together.

1800
01:15:13,144 --> 01:15:14,802
But after the food came,

1801
01:15:14,803 --> 01:15:17,172
we just focused on eating.

1802
01:15:17,173 --> 01:15:18,712
We found it funny...

1803
01:15:18,713 --> 01:15:21,082
as we realized we weren't interested in what we aren't good at.

1804
01:15:21,083 --> 01:15:22,583
We give up really fast.

1805
01:15:23,484 --> 01:15:27,023
When it seems like we have a good chance,

1806
01:15:27,024 --> 01:15:28,704
we work hard as if our lives depend on it.

1807
01:15:28,784 --> 01:15:30,422
But when the odds seem slim,

1808
01:15:30,423 --> 01:15:32,154
we're just happy to be a part of it.

1809
01:15:32,453 --> 01:15:34,723
Let's not try to sing well.

1810
01:15:34,724 --> 01:15:36,434
Let's sing with our pure voices.

1811
01:15:36,593 --> 01:15:38,064
- Let's do that. - Yes.

1812
01:15:38,163 --> 01:15:40,064
(Yong Woo and Ju Yeon's waiting room)

1813
01:15:40,434 --> 01:15:41,462
Let's practice while looking in the mirror.

1814
01:15:41,463 --> 01:15:43,373
- Say hello first. - Hello.

1815
01:15:44,104 --> 01:15:47,473
I'm Yong Woo, the oldest among the guys.

1816
01:15:47,474 --> 01:15:49,842
I'm Ju Yeon, the youngest.

1817
01:15:49,843 --> 01:15:54,843
One, two, three, four, baby, got me looking so crazy

1818
01:15:54,944 --> 01:15:57,114
I'm falling into a daydream

1819
01:15:57,284 --> 01:16:01,053
Got me feeling you, would you like to tell me too?

1820
01:16:01,284 --> 01:16:02,423
While we were practicing,

1821
01:16:02,694 --> 01:16:04,122
it was so funny.

1822
01:16:04,123 --> 01:16:05,422
The bathroom was the only place...

1823
01:16:05,423 --> 01:16:06,724
where there was a mirror.

1824
01:16:06,923 --> 01:16:08,693
When we were standing still,

1825
01:16:08,694 --> 01:16:10,992
it only showed up to our shoulders.

1826
01:16:10,993 --> 01:16:12,632
And we practiced there...

1827
01:16:12,633 --> 01:16:14,503
in a furry hat and sunglasses.

1828
01:16:15,264 --> 01:16:17,003
(Picking up)

1829
01:16:17,774 --> 01:16:19,074
(Rushing)

1830
01:16:19,173 --> 01:16:22,814
Because I know what you like, boy

1831
01:16:24,043 --> 01:16:27,684
You're my chemical hype boy

1832
01:16:28,814 --> 01:16:31,354
It's gone like a dream

1833
01:16:32,354 --> 01:16:33,382
I want you

1834
01:16:33,383 --> 01:16:35,824
Take him to the sky

1835
01:16:36,123 --> 01:16:38,623
You know I hype you, boy

1836
01:16:45,493 --> 01:16:47,439
Let's do something like this. Let's finish it like this.

1837
01:16:47,463 --> 01:16:48,764
This is good enough.

1838
01:16:48,864 --> 01:16:49,973
Let's keep practicing.

1839
01:16:49,974 --> 01:16:51,132
Don't take a rest.

1840
01:16:51,133 --> 01:16:53,904
(They keep practicing without a rest.)

1841
01:17:22,264 --> 01:17:24,733
(Practicing)

1842
01:17:24,734 --> 01:17:26,703
One step each.

1843
01:17:27,343 --> 01:17:28,474
- One step. - One step.

1844
01:17:29,104 --> 01:17:30,213
Is going to the right easy?

1845
01:17:31,074 --> 01:17:32,713
One step.

1846
01:17:34,684 --> 01:17:36,514
One step.

1847
01:17:37,784 --> 01:17:39,252
- Old - Wait.

1848
01:17:39,253 --> 01:17:41,284
- Old - Old

1849
01:17:41,484 --> 01:17:43,524
- Days - Days

1850
01:17:44,253 --> 01:17:46,663
- I go backward, shaking my body. - Yes.

1851
01:17:46,894 --> 01:17:49,064
Like a dream

1852
01:17:49,593 --> 01:17:50,894
Do this part.

1853
01:17:51,593 --> 01:17:53,604
My

1854
01:17:53,734 --> 01:17:55,163
- Right foot first. - Okay.

1855
01:17:55,434 --> 01:17:57,173
- My - Is it the right foot?

1856
01:17:57,774 --> 01:17:59,274
- My - There you go.

1857
01:17:59,444 --> 01:18:00,574
(Hurting)

1858
01:18:02,074 --> 01:18:03,144
It really made a sound.

1859
01:18:03,314 --> 01:18:04,514
(Showing his fighting spirit)

1860
01:18:05,043 --> 01:18:08,444
- You're my - You're my

1861
01:18:08,984 --> 01:18:10,114
- Like this. - Like this.

1862
01:18:13,684 --> 01:18:15,684
I should move my hips a lot.

1863
01:18:17,654 --> 01:18:20,993
- My chemical hype boy - Hype boy

1864
01:18:21,564 --> 01:18:22,934
(Posing)

1865
01:18:27,833 --> 01:18:29,133
Do that in the middle.

1866
01:18:29,404 --> 01:18:30,434
My gosh.

1867
01:18:39,743 --> 01:18:40,743
Act cute.

1868
01:18:40,744 --> 01:18:41,944
(Acting cute)

1869
01:18:42,083 --> 01:18:43,154
(A big guy acting cute)

1870
01:18:43,184 --> 01:18:44,752
You should do it well.

1871
01:18:44,753 --> 01:18:46,724
But it's hard.

1872
01:18:49,623 --> 01:18:52,493
- Okay. - You're my

1873
01:18:53,793 --> 01:18:55,993
- They did it. - They got the move for sure.

1874
01:18:56,264 --> 01:18:57,394
They're working very hard.

1875
01:18:57,534 --> 01:19:00,934
Yes. He does everything she wants. That's amazing.

1876
01:19:01,303 --> 01:19:03,873
(The house in Seorae Village)

1877
01:19:05,303 --> 01:19:07,873
(Yun Jae comes back after solving the tire issue.)

1878
01:19:08,503 --> 01:19:10,042
Let's practice.

1879
01:19:10,043 --> 01:19:11,912
It'll be better to sing something easy, right?

1880
01:19:11,913 --> 01:19:13,283
There's no way we will win anyway.

1881
01:19:13,284 --> 01:19:14,743
- Can you not sing "My Story?" - No.

1882
01:19:15,144 --> 01:19:16,752
- Are you crazy? It's Naul. - Is that so?

1883
01:19:16,753 --> 01:19:18,284
- So, "It Would Be Good?" - Yes.

1884
01:19:18,383 --> 01:19:21,052
(They change the song and start practicing.)

1885
01:19:21,053 --> 01:19:22,383
It would be good

1886
01:19:23,053 --> 01:19:27,524
When you talk about someone else, I sometimes

1887
01:19:27,824 --> 01:19:30,133
- You're the only one - You're the only one

1888
01:19:30,234 --> 01:19:32,333
- Why do both of us sound bad? - What?

1889
01:19:32,764 --> 01:19:33,963
Are you okay with our tones?

1890
01:19:34,133 --> 01:19:35,703
I get what she means.

1891
01:19:36,133 --> 01:19:38,372
It's because they're trying to sound good.

1892
01:19:38,373 --> 01:19:40,802
They shouldn't try to sound good.

1893
01:19:40,803 --> 01:19:41,803
- Is that so? - Right.

1894
01:19:41,804 --> 01:19:43,614
(They're singing "Dream" again.)

1895
01:19:44,173 --> 01:19:45,613
(Something like this)

1896
01:19:45,614 --> 01:19:48,243
(You pretend you didn't hear it)

1897
01:19:48,413 --> 01:19:49,483
This won't do.

1898
01:19:49,484 --> 01:19:51,583
(He tries another song.)

1899
01:19:53,024 --> 01:19:55,923
- We should lower the key. - I hope it's not a dream

1900
01:19:56,154 --> 01:19:58,753
(He keep singing passionately while glancing over.)

1901
01:19:59,123 --> 01:20:00,623
I think we should lower the key.

1902
01:20:00,663 --> 01:20:01,763
Is it too high?

1903
01:20:01,764 --> 01:20:05,534
(He sings again after lowering the key.)

1904
01:20:06,303 --> 01:20:07,303
(Glancing)

1905
01:20:09,534 --> 01:20:10,894
I don't think this song suits you.

1906
01:20:12,104 --> 01:20:13,202
You sound too nasal.

1907
01:20:13,203 --> 01:20:16,074
(He tries another song.)

1908
01:20:16,974 --> 01:20:20,742
I still love you

1909
01:20:20,743 --> 01:20:23,684
Is there a song where you sound less nasal?

1910
01:20:24,154 --> 01:20:26,915
I think you sound more nasal when you sing a song by a female artist.

1911
01:20:27,024 --> 01:20:29,623
(He tries singing without a nasal sound.)

1912
01:20:29,824 --> 01:20:32,093
You know it too

1913
01:20:32,194 --> 01:20:34,163
"Know it too." This also...

1914
01:20:34,293 --> 01:20:35,523
I don't think this is it.

1915
01:20:35,524 --> 01:20:38,133
- Oh, no. - "Know it too."

1916
01:20:38,934 --> 01:20:40,764
It's because of her job.

1917
01:20:41,104 --> 01:20:42,979
- She hates his singing. - She hates his singing.

1918
01:20:43,003 --> 01:20:44,302
I could walk this path

1919
01:20:44,303 --> 01:20:46,944
"His path." Don't pronounce it like that. Say "This path."

1920
01:20:47,144 --> 01:20:48,242
It sounds tacky.

1921
01:20:48,243 --> 01:20:49,813
"His path." You sing it like this.

1922
01:20:49,814 --> 01:20:52,314
(They changed the song again.)

1923
01:20:54,243 --> 01:20:55,543
(Did you know?)

1924
01:20:58,014 --> 01:20:59,724
- I can't sing this note. - It's so funny.

1925
01:21:00,024 --> 01:21:01,724
Don't you know how I feel?

1926
01:21:01,854 --> 01:21:02,854
"Don't you."

1927
01:21:02,855 --> 01:21:04,724
- These days, I - "These days."

1928
01:21:05,194 --> 01:21:07,992
He loves singing a ballad song...

1929
01:21:07,993 --> 01:21:11,234
with a soft nasal voice.

1930
01:21:11,434 --> 01:21:14,962
He sings with a very nasal and airy voice.

1931
01:21:14,963 --> 01:21:17,104
So when I hear him singing,

1932
01:21:18,703 --> 01:21:22,342
it sounds like he's overdoing it.

1933
01:21:22,343 --> 01:21:25,242
He's very competitive...

1934
01:21:25,243 --> 01:21:26,683
when it comes to something he's good at and confident in.

1935
01:21:26,684 --> 01:21:28,113
One of them is singing.

1936
01:21:28,114 --> 01:21:32,013
It's a little difficult for me to point out...

1937
01:21:32,014 --> 01:21:34,753
something he's confident in.

1938
01:21:35,053 --> 01:21:38,224
It was me trying not to talk a lot about it.

1939
01:21:38,493 --> 01:21:40,622
She was in a bad condition too.

1940
01:21:40,623 --> 01:21:41,792
But she kept pointing out.

1941
01:21:41,793 --> 01:21:43,233
She's bad either.

1942
01:21:43,234 --> 01:21:44,793
But if I had said something,

1943
01:21:45,064 --> 01:21:47,233
I might've been scolded. So I listened quietly.

1944
01:21:47,234 --> 01:21:48,910
- Sing a song that isn't dramatic. - My throat is in a bad condition.

1945
01:21:48,934 --> 01:21:50,733
I can't sing a song that is not dramatic.

1946
01:21:50,734 --> 01:21:51,773
(Confident)

1947
01:21:51,774 --> 01:21:53,403
You try to use techniques.

1948
01:21:53,404 --> 01:21:54,842
- It makes it sound... - That's true.

1949
01:21:54,843 --> 01:21:56,712
More nasal.

1950
01:21:56,713 --> 01:21:58,712
- I drink every day - Let's sing "Hate You."

1951
01:21:58,713 --> 01:21:59,784
Sing this song.

1952
01:21:59,913 --> 01:22:01,183
(I want)

1953
01:22:01,184 --> 01:22:03,484
(And resent)

1954
01:22:03,684 --> 01:22:05,713
Choose a song while thinking about the lyrics.

1955
01:22:05,984 --> 01:22:08,452
As someone who works in an entertainment company,

1956
01:22:08,453 --> 01:22:11,922
I think storytelling is the most important aspect...

1957
01:22:11,923 --> 01:22:13,992
of any song.

1958
01:22:13,993 --> 01:22:16,263
So I kept asking this question.

1959
01:22:16,264 --> 01:22:20,002
"What story do you want to tell..."

1960
01:22:20,003 --> 01:22:22,263
"through this song?"

1961
01:22:22,264 --> 01:22:24,934
We came here to meet a good person.

1962
01:22:25,234 --> 01:22:29,574
It's a little awkward to sing a break-up song.

1963
01:22:29,673 --> 01:22:33,413
If you try to sound good here, it's going to be more ridiculous.

1964
01:22:33,444 --> 01:22:34,984
It's better to make it funny.

1965
01:22:35,444 --> 01:22:38,514
(Will Yun Jae and Ji Won be able to perform on stage?)

1966
01:22:39,413 --> 01:22:43,593
(Yun Ha and Jung Sub are practicing as well.)

1967
01:22:43,993 --> 01:22:47,793
Let's stop

1968
01:22:48,123 --> 01:22:49,893
(Let's stop)

1969
01:22:49,894 --> 01:22:51,163
Let's stop now.

1970
01:22:51,764 --> 01:22:52,833
Yes. Let's stop.

1971
01:22:53,434 --> 01:22:55,003
This is the first contest.

1972
01:22:55,364 --> 01:22:56,502
For the second one...

1973
01:22:56,503 --> 01:22:58,502
We'll go there.

1974
01:22:58,503 --> 01:23:00,503
We'll be doing it with Singaporeans.

1975
01:23:00,904 --> 01:23:03,144
Playing the instrument together.

1976
01:23:04,743 --> 01:23:07,143
I just think we're going to see a concert.

1977
01:23:07,144 --> 01:23:08,514
Jae Hyung's concert.

1978
01:23:08,684 --> 01:23:12,184
(Singer Park is preparing for a concert.)

1979
01:23:12,953 --> 01:23:16,023
- I think Ju Yeon would dance. - Yes.

1980
01:23:16,024 --> 01:23:18,123
(A dance performance is also ready.)

1981
01:23:18,553 --> 01:23:20,992
Let's add something funny too.

1982
01:23:20,993 --> 01:23:22,364
- Okay. - What can we do?

1983
01:23:22,663 --> 01:23:24,033
We should do something impactful.

1984
01:23:24,034 --> 01:23:25,063
(His sister suddenly became enthusiastic.)

1985
01:23:25,064 --> 01:23:27,103
Show me a move you can do.

1986
01:23:27,104 --> 01:23:28,104
(Standing up)

1987
01:23:28,264 --> 01:23:30,633
How about doing popping here?

1988
01:23:30,734 --> 01:23:31,802
(An AI dance)

1989
01:23:31,803 --> 01:23:33,873
Yes. Do something like that.

1990
01:23:34,673 --> 01:23:36,343
I like it.

1991
01:23:37,413 --> 01:23:38,413
Or...

1992
01:23:39,114 --> 01:23:40,984
Wave your hands.

1993
01:23:41,213 --> 01:23:43,883
Wave your hands, 1, 2, 3, 4.

1994
01:23:43,953 --> 01:23:45,853
One, two.

1995
01:23:45,854 --> 01:23:46,923
But... Do it like this.

1996
01:23:47,423 --> 01:23:48,984
I think we can just do this.

1997
01:23:51,224 --> 01:23:52,422
It's cute.

1998
01:23:52,423 --> 01:23:54,063
(He's never seen his sister doing a cute dance.)

1999
01:23:54,064 --> 01:23:56,564
- What's next? - I've never seen things like this.

2000
01:23:56,963 --> 01:23:58,492
Siblings look at each other,

2001
01:23:58,493 --> 01:24:00,203
laughing and saying it's cute.

2002
01:24:00,633 --> 01:24:01,833
- They look very happy. - Yes.

2003
01:24:01,934 --> 01:24:03,273
He said his sister looked cute.

2004
01:24:03,274 --> 01:24:05,194
I've never heard something like that in my life.

2005
01:24:06,944 --> 01:24:08,574
Two, three, four.

2006
01:24:09,444 --> 01:24:10,843
Then turn.

2007
01:24:15,314 --> 01:24:17,484
- I'm nervous. - All of a sudden?

2008
01:24:17,883 --> 01:24:20,653
- Who will you choose if you win? - Here...

2009
01:24:20,654 --> 01:24:22,284
You should make a choice right now.

2010
01:24:22,953 --> 01:24:24,154
- Right now? - Yes.

2011
01:24:24,423 --> 01:24:25,922
Who do you want to go to Singapore with?

2012
01:24:25,923 --> 01:24:27,364
I haven't thought about it yet.

2013
01:24:27,524 --> 01:24:29,564
You want to win first? Me too.

2014
01:24:30,394 --> 01:24:31,934
I'll just think about it later.

2015
01:24:32,034 --> 01:24:36,064
I did think that I should put more effort into this for Se Seung.

2016
01:24:36,264 --> 01:24:38,064
If Se Seung has the right to select her date,

2017
01:24:38,133 --> 01:24:40,404
she'll choose Jung Sub.

2018
01:24:41,373 --> 01:24:43,074
The reason why I'm conflicted is...

2019
01:24:44,043 --> 01:24:47,144
You're probably conflicted because you only have one choice.

2020
01:24:47,484 --> 01:24:49,583
No. I'd rather not have to choose.

2021
01:24:49,784 --> 01:24:51,184
It's like, "This too?"

2022
01:24:51,784 --> 01:24:53,284
Does it hurt your pride?

2023
01:24:53,383 --> 01:24:54,752
- No, it's not that. - I see.

2024
01:24:54,753 --> 01:24:57,113
I never let my pride get in the way of something like this.

2025
01:24:57,224 --> 01:24:58,769
It just feels like it would be too much...

2026
01:24:58,793 --> 01:25:00,894
- if we go on this date too. - I see.

2027
01:25:00,993 --> 01:25:03,264
It feels like we're confining each other.

2028
01:25:03,593 --> 01:25:06,633
But then, if not Jung Sub, who else could I choose?

2029
01:25:08,203 --> 01:25:09,323
Then you would have to lose.

2030
01:25:09,434 --> 01:25:13,803
But that day when we could choose to send "None," two days ago,

2031
01:25:13,974 --> 01:25:15,454
- he didn't send you a message. - Me?

2032
01:25:15,644 --> 01:25:17,114
- Jung Sub didn't. - Right.

2033
01:25:17,713 --> 01:25:18,912
What was that about?

2034
01:25:18,913 --> 01:25:21,184
- He sent it to Ji Won. - Why?

2035
01:25:21,743 --> 01:25:23,614
I didn't ask him that.

2036
01:25:24,713 --> 01:25:25,913
Well, at the time...

2037
01:25:28,053 --> 01:25:29,083
You're right.

2038
01:25:29,993 --> 01:25:30,993
You're right.

2039
01:25:31,453 --> 01:25:33,193
- What's this? - "You're Different."

2040
01:25:33,194 --> 01:25:34,469
(Yun Jae and Ji Won are singing their 20th song together.)

2041
01:25:34,493 --> 01:25:37,832
Incomparable butterflies

2042
01:25:37,833 --> 01:25:38,833
Gosh, I can't.

2043
01:25:38,834 --> 01:25:41,210
(She doesn't even have the energy to get angry at him anymore.)

2044
01:25:41,234 --> 01:25:46,872
Even though it's not love

2045
01:25:46,873 --> 01:25:47,903
Gosh, my throat feels more relaxed.

2046
01:25:47,904 --> 01:25:49,502
Our relationship

2047
01:25:49,503 --> 01:25:51,813
He said his throat feels more relaxed.

2048
01:25:51,814 --> 01:25:53,514
- His throat feels more relaxed. - Nice.

2049
01:25:53,614 --> 01:25:55,120
- Just like that? - He said it felt more relaxed.

2050
01:25:55,144 --> 01:25:57,053
Yun Jae is charming.

2051
01:25:57,614 --> 01:25:59,183
He just quickly blurted out,

2052
01:25:59,184 --> 01:26:01,029
- "Gosh, my throat's more relaxed." - He's charming the more I know him.

2053
01:26:01,053 --> 01:26:03,023
Goodness, he's going to damage his vocal cords.

2054
01:26:03,024 --> 01:26:04,393
He's going to end up coughing up blood.

2055
01:26:04,394 --> 01:26:05,674
I want to watch that part again.

2056
01:26:07,093 --> 01:26:12,693
Even though it's not love

2057
01:26:12,694 --> 01:26:13,702
Gosh, my throat feels more relaxed.

2058
01:26:13,703 --> 01:26:17,073
Our relationship, the darkness

2059
01:26:17,074 --> 01:26:19,203
This is better. It sounds like it's coming from here.

2060
01:26:19,534 --> 01:26:21,774
(He's immersed in the song.)

2061
01:26:22,843 --> 01:26:24,543
Time

2062
01:26:24,743 --> 01:26:28,413
Is flooded by light

2063
01:26:28,514 --> 01:26:30,453
- You - You

2064
01:26:31,614 --> 01:26:32,783
We only sang the last part together.

2065
01:26:32,784 --> 01:26:34,552
I prefer this one or...

2066
01:26:34,553 --> 01:26:35,753
"Drunken Confession."

2067
01:26:35,854 --> 01:26:37,952
I think your voice sounds better when you're singing this one.

2068
01:26:37,953 --> 01:26:38,953
No.

2069
01:26:38,954 --> 01:26:40,193
Then sing "Drunken Confession."

2070
01:26:40,194 --> 01:26:42,823
(He starts singing the 25th song.)

2071
01:26:42,824 --> 01:26:46,492
I drank for the first time in a while

2072
01:26:46,493 --> 01:26:47,604
Gosh, okay.

2073
01:26:50,203 --> 01:26:54,104
Yun Jae, just do whatever you want.

2074
01:26:55,274 --> 01:26:57,614
(He is doing whatever he wants.)

2075
01:26:58,014 --> 01:26:59,913
(These days, I)

2076
01:27:00,213 --> 01:27:02,582
Only think about you

2077
01:27:02,583 --> 01:27:04,313
(Like a crazy person)

2078
01:27:04,314 --> 01:27:05,383
Is this the second verse?

2079
01:27:05,713 --> 01:27:08,484
No, I'm not drunk

2080
01:27:08,583 --> 01:27:10,423
I'm telling the truth

2081
01:27:10,524 --> 01:27:14,364
I really love you

2082
01:27:14,724 --> 01:27:20,064
I want you so much I have tears in my eyes

2083
01:27:20,163 --> 01:27:21,604
This one is okay for me,

2084
01:27:21,803 --> 01:27:23,723
but I think "The Blue in You" is better for you.

2085
01:27:24,003 --> 01:27:26,802
What you prefer is... It's because you prefer this too.

2086
01:27:26,803 --> 01:27:27,803
Yes.

2087
01:27:27,804 --> 01:27:30,412
Then "The Blue in You" is the one we should go with,

2088
01:27:30,413 --> 01:27:32,114
and I can use my voice like that...

2089
01:27:32,274 --> 01:27:34,683
I don't care. We can do it if you're okay with your nasal voice.

2090
01:27:34,684 --> 01:27:35,912
(Will they be able to perform on stage?)

2091
01:27:35,913 --> 01:27:38,654
(Meanwhile, Cho A and Cheol Hyeon are busy eating.)

2092
01:27:38,854 --> 01:27:41,224
Yong Woo seems to like you a lot.

2093
01:27:41,623 --> 01:27:42,743
It's because I like him too.

2094
01:27:42,883 --> 01:27:45,953
I just felt a bond with him while watching the sibling reveal videos.

2095
01:27:46,694 --> 01:27:49,223
I thought that maybe he learned how to...

2096
01:27:49,224 --> 01:27:50,833
repress his emotions a bit too early.

2097
01:27:51,064 --> 01:27:53,864
I really hope things go well between the two of you.

2098
01:27:54,264 --> 01:27:55,503
He seems like a good person.

2099
01:27:55,604 --> 01:27:58,034
He's dependable and has broad shoulders.

2100
01:27:58,703 --> 01:28:00,773
I really like how dependable he is.

2101
01:28:00,774 --> 01:28:02,542
I was very moved at that time...

2102
01:28:02,543 --> 01:28:04,273
when he went on a date with Ji Won...

2103
01:28:04,274 --> 01:28:05,574
but still sent me a message.

2104
01:28:06,074 --> 01:28:08,684
Right. I guess Yong Woo always had feelings for you.

2105
01:28:08,883 --> 01:28:11,653
I felt that Jung Sub...

2106
01:28:11,654 --> 01:28:13,623
- was leaning more toward Se Seung. - Yes.

2107
01:28:13,724 --> 01:28:15,083
You should sign up for that.

2108
01:28:15,654 --> 01:28:16,654
The 1-on-1 chat?

2109
01:28:16,824 --> 01:28:18,452
I did think about that, though.

2110
01:28:18,453 --> 01:28:21,922
If Yong Woo went with other people...

2111
01:28:21,923 --> 01:28:24,092
to the basement hideout for a 1-on-1 chat,

2112
01:28:24,093 --> 01:28:26,463
I would be so upset.

2113
01:28:26,564 --> 01:28:27,564
Right.

2114
01:28:27,864 --> 01:28:30,202
So, by that same logic, I guess...

2115
01:28:30,203 --> 01:28:32,873
I don't want to make him upset.

2116
01:28:32,974 --> 01:28:35,143
If he does that, I feel like...

2117
01:28:35,144 --> 01:28:36,842
you'd be hurt even though you'd pretend otherwise.

2118
01:28:36,843 --> 01:28:38,242
- Right. - No, I wouldn't say hurt.

2119
01:28:38,243 --> 01:28:41,542
- I'd be disappointed and sad. - I feel like you'd choose...

2120
01:28:41,543 --> 01:28:43,582
some other guy just out of spite.

2121
01:28:43,583 --> 01:28:44,583
Right.

2122
01:28:44,584 --> 01:28:45,854
There's this thing, though.

2123
01:28:45,953 --> 01:28:48,953
Someone who's popular with everyone feels a bit overwhelming.

2124
01:28:49,053 --> 01:28:50,293
- That's Yong Woo. - Yes.

2125
01:28:50,394 --> 01:28:54,723
So at some point, I started feeling a little overwhelmed.

2126
01:28:54,724 --> 01:28:57,133
He gets along with all the female participants...

2127
01:28:57,333 --> 01:28:59,894
and has chemistry with them,

2128
01:29:00,234 --> 01:29:04,133
so it makes me feel uncomfortable, I guess.

2129
01:29:05,074 --> 01:29:06,434
- Uncomfortable? - Yes.

2130
01:29:06,873 --> 01:29:07,943
Why?

2131
01:29:07,944 --> 01:29:10,644
I guess I just want him all for myself.

2132
01:29:12,014 --> 01:29:13,413
Doesn't everyone?

2133
01:29:14,083 --> 01:29:15,389
About people they have feelings for.

2134
01:29:15,413 --> 01:29:16,514
I guess so.

2135
01:29:16,814 --> 01:29:19,313
He's someone who is very nice...

2136
01:29:19,314 --> 01:29:21,354
and gentle to everyone.

2137
01:29:22,053 --> 01:29:24,223
So, how should I put this?

2138
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:27,122
He always sends me messages. That's for sure, but...

2139
01:29:27,123 --> 01:29:30,993
I don't feel much of a difference in the way he acts.

2140
01:29:31,493 --> 01:29:33,564
So there have been a few times when I was confused.

2141
01:29:34,663 --> 01:29:36,002
Yong Woo told me,

2142
01:29:36,003 --> 01:29:37,904
"You're different when you're with me,"

2143
01:29:38,003 --> 01:29:40,274
"compared to when we're with everyone else."

2144
01:29:40,944 --> 01:29:43,273
"I want you to show this side of you..."

2145
01:29:43,274 --> 01:29:45,274
"when we're with the others too."

2146
01:29:46,314 --> 01:29:48,283
(Cho A and Yong Woo's second date)

2147
01:29:48,284 --> 01:29:52,082
(I see these sides of you, Cho A.)

2148
01:29:52,083 --> 01:29:55,422
(When we're all together, if you just...)

2149
01:29:55,423 --> 01:29:58,793
(slightly let them show, I feel like we'll all have much more fun.)

2150
01:29:58,993 --> 01:30:00,053
Really?

2151
01:30:00,264 --> 01:30:04,092
(That's what I think, the more we talk.)

2152
01:30:04,093 --> 01:30:05,564
I see.

2153
01:30:05,934 --> 01:30:07,963
Did you show him your easy-going side?

2154
01:30:08,364 --> 01:30:10,873
I was just being myself.

2155
01:30:11,503 --> 01:30:13,673
But I guess he felt I was very cheerful.

2156
01:30:13,774 --> 01:30:16,673
I'm not sure what exactly made him say that,

2157
01:30:17,444 --> 01:30:20,343
but I think he was referring to the difference in energy.

2158
01:30:20,543 --> 01:30:22,742
He said he wanted you to show that side to other people too?

2159
01:30:22,743 --> 01:30:25,283
Yes. But, for me, that was...

2160
01:30:25,284 --> 01:30:27,153
Why? Wouldn't he want to be the only one who knows?

2161
01:30:27,154 --> 01:30:28,952
Right. Aren't people usually like that?

2162
01:30:28,953 --> 01:30:29,953
Right.

2163
01:30:31,093 --> 01:30:34,092
"Isn't it better if the person who means more to me..."

2164
01:30:34,093 --> 01:30:35,893
"behaves differently when she's with me?"

2165
01:30:35,894 --> 01:30:37,833
That's what I think too.

2166
01:30:37,934 --> 01:30:39,263
There are things that I notice,

2167
01:30:39,264 --> 01:30:41,434
so I want to tell Cho A about them.

2168
01:30:41,633 --> 01:30:43,703
I want her...

2169
01:30:43,803 --> 01:30:46,234
to be with a good person.

2170
01:30:46,333 --> 01:30:48,444
So I can't help but talk to her.

2171
01:30:49,644 --> 01:30:51,773
I guess that could be confusing.

2172
01:30:51,774 --> 01:30:53,313
I get why she might think that way.

2173
01:30:53,314 --> 01:30:54,783
People usually like being the only one to see different sides.

2174
01:30:54,784 --> 01:30:56,582
But he's actually telling her to not only show it to him...

2175
01:30:56,583 --> 01:30:58,082
but to show it to everyone else too.

2176
01:30:58,083 --> 01:30:59,514
Gosh, what could that mean?

2177
01:30:59,784 --> 01:31:03,184
(The 42nd song, "Dear. My Fool")

2178
01:31:03,593 --> 01:31:08,524
Don't worry too much

2179
01:31:08,864 --> 01:31:11,992
I cried again yesterday

2180
01:31:11,993 --> 01:31:13,092
This key is comfortable to me.

2181
01:31:13,093 --> 01:31:16,364
(It looks like they finally found the right song.)

2182
01:31:17,534 --> 01:31:20,342
I'll try harder for you

2183
01:31:20,343 --> 01:31:21,343
Use your chest.

2184
01:31:21,604 --> 01:31:24,413
I'll live for you

2185
01:31:24,514 --> 01:31:26,774
- Sing so everyone can hear you. - I'll throw away

2186
01:31:26,883 --> 01:31:29,912
All my weakness

2187
01:31:29,913 --> 01:31:30,953
That's right.

2188
01:31:30,984 --> 01:31:32,183
My love, you fool

2189
01:31:32,184 --> 01:31:34,082
I'll just sing along to "My love, you fool."

2190
01:31:34,083 --> 01:31:36,253
My love, you fool

2191
01:31:36,284 --> 01:31:38,170
- Yes. We found it. - All right. Let's sing this one.

2192
01:31:38,194 --> 01:31:40,194
Gosh, we finally found it.

2193
01:31:40,423 --> 01:31:41,623
There was no time left,

2194
01:31:41,724 --> 01:31:43,523
so I was mostly thinking about...

2195
01:31:43,524 --> 01:31:45,534
singing something we could practice quickly.

2196
01:31:45,694 --> 01:31:50,274
This is a song Yun Jae has a lot of experience singing.

2197
01:31:50,404 --> 01:31:54,043
Anyway, I do feel like I'm a fool...

2198
01:31:54,404 --> 01:31:56,973
A fool no less than Yun Jae when it comes to romance.

2199
01:31:56,974 --> 01:31:58,474
We chose this...

2200
01:31:59,474 --> 01:32:02,144
thinking it's a song suitable for two fools to sing.

2201
01:32:02,413 --> 01:32:03,413
- That's it. - Gosh.

2202
01:32:03,414 --> 01:32:05,514
- That's it. Gosh, finally. - Finally.

2203
01:32:06,713 --> 01:32:08,359
What a relief we were able to choose a song.

2204
01:32:08,383 --> 01:32:10,694
- Gosh, I'm exhausted. - It's hard to go on a date.

2205
01:32:10,894 --> 01:32:13,793
(Now it's time to sing and compete.)

2206
01:32:14,064 --> 01:32:16,122
- Should I drive? - Yes. Should I?

2207
01:32:16,123 --> 01:32:18,034
Do you want to? Let me be a passenger for once.

2208
01:32:19,963 --> 01:32:21,564
- Yes. - What's wrong with you?

2209
01:32:22,264 --> 01:32:23,904
Hold my bag.

2210
01:32:25,604 --> 01:32:27,043
This bag is now mine.

2211
01:32:27,444 --> 01:32:28,920
(She's pretending she didn't hear him.)

2212
01:32:28,944 --> 01:32:30,574
(Walking on eggshells)

2213
01:32:31,144 --> 01:32:33,304
(They're on their way to the location of the contest.)

2214
01:32:34,043 --> 01:32:35,614
(The cell phone holder fell.)

2215
01:32:35,814 --> 01:32:38,114
Are you trying to break everything today?

2216
01:32:38,253 --> 01:32:39,253
Put it back on.

2217
01:32:39,484 --> 01:32:40,723
Did you turn on the seat heating only for yourself?

2218
01:32:40,724 --> 01:32:42,154
It's every man for himself.

2219
01:32:42,553 --> 01:32:43,583
That's true.

2220
01:32:43,894 --> 01:32:46,694
I'm so comfortable. Being the passenger is the best.

2221
01:32:47,694 --> 01:32:50,123
Making your sister who came back from work makes you happy?

2222
01:32:50,593 --> 01:32:51,593
Of course.

2223
01:32:51,594 --> 01:32:53,332
(Being sassy)

2224
01:32:53,333 --> 01:32:55,903
There's something seriously wrong with your character.

2225
01:32:55,904 --> 01:32:57,302
I had that since I was a kid!

2226
01:32:57,303 --> 01:32:58,574
How do you even go on dates?

2227
01:32:58,904 --> 01:32:59,934
That's different.

2228
01:33:00,274 --> 01:33:03,104
You don't act like this when you're on a date with Yun Ha, right?

2229
01:33:03,814 --> 01:33:05,242
No way. Just because I'm like this with you,

2230
01:33:05,243 --> 01:33:07,163
it doesn't mean I'm like this with other people.

2231
01:33:07,343 --> 01:33:08,713
I know what embarrassment is.

2232
01:33:10,953 --> 01:33:12,952
He's really funny.

2233
01:33:12,953 --> 01:33:15,553
He's like this, but he gets really nervous on dates.

2234
01:33:15,623 --> 01:33:16,654
- Yes. - Right.

2235
01:33:17,093 --> 01:33:19,823
We should be very sweet and lovely.

2236
01:33:19,824 --> 01:33:20,922
- All right. Let's do that. - Yes.

2237
01:33:20,923 --> 01:33:23,363
I noticed that smiling while I sing...

2238
01:33:23,364 --> 01:33:24,993
really eased my nerves.

2239
01:33:25,463 --> 01:33:28,163
Think of us as adorable.

2240
01:33:28,734 --> 01:33:29,963
Being adorable is the best.

2241
01:33:31,203 --> 01:33:33,333
What about My Very LookalikeJeans?

2242
01:33:33,873 --> 01:33:37,043
My Very LookalikeJeans. What do you think?

2243
01:33:37,343 --> 01:33:38,343
We're here.

2244
01:33:38,344 --> 01:33:40,073
(They've arrived at the contest venue.)

2245
01:33:40,074 --> 01:33:41,194
I've never been here before.

2246
01:33:43,644 --> 01:33:45,284
Are we performing outside?

2247
01:33:45,713 --> 01:33:47,582
What kind of place is this?

2248
01:33:47,583 --> 01:33:49,160
(The entrance of the contest venue seems suspicious.)

2249
01:33:49,184 --> 01:33:51,524
- Goodness. - Goodness gracious.

2250
01:33:54,194 --> 01:33:55,194
This is it.

2251
01:33:55,963 --> 01:33:56,963
What?

2252
01:34:02,163 --> 01:34:03,773
The contest venue is a bit weird.

2253
01:34:03,774 --> 01:34:05,332
Where on earth are they performing?

2254
01:34:05,333 --> 01:34:06,673
A mountain cabin?

2255
01:34:06,774 --> 01:34:07,802
- What? - What?

2256
01:34:07,803 --> 01:34:09,803
- Is that a local festival? - At a mountain cabin?

2257
01:34:09,974 --> 01:34:11,474
Is that like a ginseng festival?

2258
01:34:14,843 --> 01:34:16,042
I think everyone will be great.

2259
01:34:16,043 --> 01:34:17,912
Right. Winning isn't even my goal.

2260
01:34:17,913 --> 01:34:20,724
I just intend on looking adorable and cute.

2261
01:34:23,993 --> 01:34:25,792
(A singing contest will be held at a mountain cabin.)

2262
01:34:25,793 --> 01:34:27,493
Gosh, Mr. Lee.

2263
01:34:27,593 --> 01:34:28,764
Gosh, hello.

2264
01:34:28,864 --> 01:34:30,963
- Gosh, the Lee's. - Hello.

2265
01:34:31,593 --> 01:34:33,663
It looked like a mountain cabin.

2266
01:34:33,764 --> 01:34:35,604
It felt like grandma's house too.

2267
01:34:36,534 --> 01:34:39,033
(The 1st Duet Contest With Siblings)

2268
01:34:39,034 --> 01:34:40,842
(The 1st Duet Contest With Siblings)

2269
01:34:40,843 --> 01:34:43,743
In the front, there was a stage...

2270
01:34:43,843 --> 01:34:45,774
with two microphone stands.

2271
01:34:46,614 --> 01:34:48,983
When I first got there, I was so surprised.

2272
01:34:48,984 --> 01:34:50,713
At a location I haven't even imagined of...

2273
01:34:50,913 --> 01:34:53,713
The place was full of warmth.

2274
01:34:53,984 --> 01:34:55,784
This contest is bigger than I thought it was.

2275
01:34:56,923 --> 01:34:57,923
- But... - Gosh.

2276
01:34:58,154 --> 01:34:59,992
- Gosh. - But they made a comfortable vibe.

2277
01:34:59,993 --> 01:35:01,663
Right. This is actually better.

2278
01:35:03,493 --> 01:35:05,694
- Did you practice a lot? - For the contest?

2279
01:35:06,394 --> 01:35:07,434
Well...

2280
01:35:08,163 --> 01:35:10,003
It was practically an open stage,

2281
01:35:10,064 --> 01:35:12,034
so I felt a huge amount of pressure.

2282
01:35:12,234 --> 01:35:14,343
It was a restaurant,

2283
01:35:14,543 --> 01:35:17,474
so I felt less pressure.

2284
01:35:18,673 --> 01:35:22,144
"Are we just eating, drinking, and singing?"

2285
01:35:22,583 --> 01:35:24,283
- Gosh. - Goodness.

2286
01:35:24,284 --> 01:35:25,552
- Goodness. - The superstar is here.

2287
01:35:25,553 --> 01:35:26,614
- Gosh. - Gosh.

2288
01:35:27,524 --> 01:35:30,253
Of course, I was the most wary of Jae Hyung and Se Seung.

2289
01:35:30,354 --> 01:35:32,714
Because of their singing abilities, Jae Hyung and Se Seung.

2290
01:35:33,093 --> 01:35:35,564
Jae Hyung kept carrying around a guitar.

2291
01:35:35,694 --> 01:35:37,910
It felt like he was letting us know, "We're going to win."

2292
01:35:37,934 --> 01:35:40,563
Jae Hyung's guitar had a huge impact.

2293
01:35:40,564 --> 01:35:42,462
Jae Hyung and Se Seung.

2294
01:35:42,463 --> 01:35:44,633
I thought, "They're going to win."

2295
01:35:44,734 --> 01:35:46,503
How have you all been?

2296
01:35:46,974 --> 01:35:48,802
I can tell you practiced way too much.

2297
01:35:48,803 --> 01:35:51,974
I'm looking forward to your concert today, Jae Hyung.

2298
01:35:52,274 --> 01:35:54,513
(The 1st Duet Contest with Siblings)

2299
01:35:54,514 --> 01:35:57,083
(Contest for the date in Singapore begins.)

2300
01:35:57,684 --> 01:35:58,813
Let's do this.

2301
01:35:58,814 --> 01:36:01,524
(The shy owner came out.)

2302
01:36:01,724 --> 01:36:02,922
- Hello. - Nice to meet you.

2303
01:36:02,923 --> 01:36:05,092
- To our youngest. - Hello.

2304
01:36:05,093 --> 01:36:06,953
Yes, thank you.

2305
01:36:07,163 --> 01:36:09,122
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2306
01:36:09,123 --> 01:36:10,324
She's so cute.

2307
01:36:11,593 --> 01:36:14,003
"You will be the judges of the contest."

2308
01:36:14,833 --> 01:36:17,702
"Once every performance is over, vote for the sibling..."

2309
01:36:17,703 --> 01:36:20,404
"who performed the best aside from yourself."

2310
01:36:20,974 --> 01:36:22,173
Aside from yourself.

2311
01:36:22,274 --> 01:36:24,313
"After adding all the votes, the top two siblings..."

2312
01:36:24,314 --> 01:36:26,043
"with the most votes will be chosen."

2313
01:36:26,644 --> 01:36:28,183
You never know then.

2314
01:36:28,184 --> 01:36:30,444
This has to do more with the vibe than singing skills.

2315
01:36:30,614 --> 01:36:32,614
- The force. - The force.

2316
01:36:32,713 --> 01:36:34,953
Of course, I totally want to win.

2317
01:36:35,184 --> 01:36:37,723
If I get it, I want to use it on someone I want to use it on,

2318
01:36:37,724 --> 01:36:40,623
and we'll have fun travelling around Singapore.

2319
01:36:40,963 --> 01:36:42,894
Let's balance things out, you siblings.

2320
01:36:43,564 --> 01:36:45,493
I'm just tuning it.

2321
01:36:45,694 --> 01:36:47,163
Am I finally getting to see it?

2322
01:36:47,764 --> 01:36:49,363
I'm not a good singer,

2323
01:36:49,364 --> 01:36:53,234
so I was cheering for Yong Woo to do well.

2324
01:36:53,474 --> 01:36:55,274
Shouldn't we take away five points from them?

2325
01:36:56,144 --> 01:36:58,644
Since this contest is being held anyway,

2326
01:36:58,743 --> 01:37:00,843
I'll have fun and do my best.

2327
01:37:01,514 --> 01:37:02,943
We should just get it over with.

2328
01:37:02,944 --> 01:37:03,952
You're right.

2329
01:37:03,953 --> 01:37:05,082
“Know how I feel,” and then we make a heart.

2330
01:37:05,083 --> 01:37:07,203
(Yun Ha and Jung Sub are the first siblings to sing.)

2331
01:37:11,123 --> 01:37:14,092
Hello. We're Lee Jung Sub and Lee Yun Ha.

2332
01:37:14,093 --> 01:37:15,093
And we're siblings.

2333
01:37:15,094 --> 01:37:16,793
Yes. Nice to meet you.

2334
01:37:18,764 --> 01:37:22,734
We chose to sing "Nagging" by IU.

2335
01:37:23,104 --> 01:37:25,872
We thought this song, "Nagging,"

2336
01:37:25,873 --> 01:37:29,173
really expresses the two of us well as siblings,

2337
01:37:29,373 --> 01:37:30,614
so we chose to sing it.

2338
01:37:31,243 --> 01:37:33,313
- That's a good reason. - You got this.

2339
01:37:33,314 --> 01:37:34,742
- You got this. - We'll begin then.

2340
01:37:34,743 --> 01:37:35,743
Good luck.

2341
01:37:35,744 --> 01:37:38,314
("Nagging" by Yun Ha and Jung Sub)

2342
01:37:43,623 --> 01:37:45,093
- Gosh. - Big gestures.

2343
01:38:21,024 --> 01:38:22,194
They're so cute.

2344
01:38:24,833 --> 01:38:26,333
Gosh, they're so cute.

2345
01:38:54,293 --> 01:38:55,394
So cute.

2346
01:38:56,963 --> 01:38:57,963
He was so cute.

2347
01:38:58,434 --> 01:39:01,234
He was doing little dance moves. It was really adorable.

2348
01:39:03,003 --> 01:39:04,034
He has a nice voice too.

2349
01:39:04,534 --> 01:39:09,202
(If I carry around you in my pocket)

2350
01:39:09,203 --> 01:39:11,543
(He has a unique sense of rhythm.)

2351
01:39:14,514 --> 01:39:16,343
I think I can do that dance too.

2352
01:39:18,184 --> 01:39:19,913
(Everyone's favourite part)

2353
01:39:20,583 --> 01:39:22,952
The dance where they turn was very cute.

2354
01:39:22,953 --> 01:39:24,769
They looked like they were inside a music box.

2355
01:39:24,793 --> 01:39:25,793
(Ta-Da)

2356
01:39:29,493 --> 01:39:30,524
They're turning.

2357
01:39:31,093 --> 01:39:33,034
(Jae Hyung loves it.)

2358
01:39:33,163 --> 01:39:35,463
Jung Sub was smiling as he sang,

2359
01:39:36,404 --> 01:39:39,474
and it was very charming.

2360
01:39:42,173 --> 01:39:44,444
I'm not saying I developed feelings for him.

2361
01:39:44,543 --> 01:39:45,663
It was just really charming.

2362
01:40:19,974 --> 01:40:22,213
(Even when I get mad)

2363
01:40:28,484 --> 01:40:30,324
- You're so cute. - Gosh.

2364
01:40:32,053 --> 01:40:33,423
Gosh, so adorable.

2365
01:40:39,593 --> 01:40:40,593
That was great.

2366
01:40:40,594 --> 01:40:42,364
Gosh. Siblings making a heart?

2367
01:40:42,904 --> 01:40:45,104
Amazing. Siblings making a heart?

2368
01:40:45,534 --> 01:40:46,803
How is that possible?

2369
01:40:46,974 --> 01:40:48,302
Gosh, they were good.

2370
01:40:48,303 --> 01:40:50,343
That song is very high-pitched, even for a woman.

2371
01:40:50,444 --> 01:40:52,412
Yun Jae looks like he has a crush.

2372
01:40:52,413 --> 01:40:54,582
- He has the love eyes. - His kept patting his heart.

2373
01:40:54,583 --> 01:40:56,042
He kept soothing himself.

2374
01:40:56,043 --> 01:40:58,483
- Right. - His face was totally different...

2375
01:40:58,484 --> 01:41:00,160
from when he was at the basement hideout with Ji Won.

2376
01:41:00,184 --> 01:41:01,453
That's so adorable.

2377
01:41:01,753 --> 01:41:03,052
So cute.

2378
01:41:03,053 --> 01:41:04,752
- They were great. - So cute.

2379
01:41:04,753 --> 01:41:05,952
- You were so cute. - You were very cute.

2380
01:41:05,953 --> 01:41:07,694
- Both of you were amazing. - Right.

2381
01:41:07,923 --> 01:41:09,524
I thought Yun Ha was a good singer.

2382
01:41:10,463 --> 01:41:11,903
What did you think about their song?

2383
01:41:13,064 --> 01:41:14,064
It was cute.

2384
01:41:14,434 --> 01:41:15,632
(What about their singing abilities?)

2385
01:41:15,633 --> 01:41:16,633
It was cute.

2386
01:41:18,074 --> 01:41:19,933
I've never seen siblings that are so close with each other...

2387
01:41:19,934 --> 01:41:21,743
before I came on this show.

2388
01:41:22,144 --> 01:41:24,543
They seemed like they were from another planet.

2389
01:41:24,873 --> 01:41:27,243
They're so close to each other,

2390
01:41:27,444 --> 01:41:30,083
and Jung Sub is very sweet.

2391
01:41:30,284 --> 01:41:32,114
I think I was envious too.

2392
01:41:32,583 --> 01:41:34,854
I'm scared to perform because of "Nagging."

2393
01:41:35,354 --> 01:41:36,552
That was such a strong performance.

2394
01:41:36,553 --> 01:41:38,323
I feel like you need some nagging.

2395
01:41:38,324 --> 01:41:40,123
The singer should go up on stage, then.

2396
01:41:40,423 --> 01:41:42,194
I don't back out when I'm encouraged.

2397
01:41:42,724 --> 01:41:44,023
- Why not? - Gosh. What am I going to do?

2398
01:41:44,024 --> 01:41:45,693
He's been carrying that guitar around since 11am.

2399
01:41:45,694 --> 01:41:46,763
They'll probably win.

2400
01:41:46,764 --> 01:41:48,002
(They're the number 1 siblings who everyone is wary of.)

2401
01:41:48,003 --> 01:41:49,764
- They seem experienced. - They're cute.

2402
01:41:50,163 --> 01:41:51,934
- They're cute. - What?

2403
01:41:52,333 --> 01:41:54,372
(The siblings seem unrivalled.)

2404
01:41:54,373 --> 01:41:55,503
(Gosh)

2405
01:41:56,043 --> 01:41:57,543
We finally get to hear them.

2406
01:42:00,984 --> 01:42:03,243
Hello. We're Jae Hyung...

2407
01:42:03,343 --> 01:42:05,624
- And Se Seung. And we're siblings. - And we're siblings.

2408
01:42:08,724 --> 01:42:10,523
The song we've prepared is...

2409
01:42:10,524 --> 01:42:14,024
"Twenty-Five, Twenty-One" by Jaurim.

2410
01:42:14,463 --> 01:42:16,092
The reason we chose this song is...

2411
01:42:16,093 --> 01:42:18,633
because it's the theme song...

2412
01:42:18,963 --> 01:42:21,003
of the drama our mom really likes.

2413
01:42:21,104 --> 01:42:23,803
We want to cheer her on.

2414
01:42:26,503 --> 01:42:27,743
What's the title of our song?

2415
01:42:27,974 --> 01:42:28,974
"Dear. My Fool."

2416
01:42:30,003 --> 01:42:31,014
Are you a fool?

2417
01:42:35,883 --> 01:42:37,753
(Mumbling)

2418
01:42:38,184 --> 01:42:40,465
(She's memorizing the lyrics until the very last moment.)

2419
01:42:40,883 --> 01:42:44,694
("Twenty-Five, Twenty-One" by Jae Hyung and Se Seung)

2420
01:45:00,493 --> 01:45:02,364
Se Seung was better than I expected.

2421
01:45:02,463 --> 01:45:03,623
She was amazing.

2422
01:45:03,923 --> 01:45:05,564
She did seem a bit different.

2423
01:45:08,003 --> 01:45:10,264
I could only hear the guitar and their voices.

2424
01:45:10,534 --> 01:45:12,503
So I was just immersed in their performance.

2425
01:46:04,354 --> 01:46:07,223
It was really nice to prepare for a performance with my brother...

2426
01:46:07,224 --> 01:46:09,123
for the first time in a while.

2427
01:46:09,224 --> 01:46:11,963
I think it would be a big present to my mom.

2428
01:46:12,064 --> 01:46:14,393
It was fun to make the preparations and perform...

2429
01:46:14,394 --> 01:46:16,764
with my younger sister.

2430
01:46:47,093 --> 01:46:48,933
They brought singers.

2431
01:46:48,934 --> 01:46:50,104
Seriously.

2432
01:46:50,434 --> 01:46:51,774
That was insane.

2433
01:46:53,234 --> 01:46:55,594
- What? I think Ji Won fell for him. - Ji Won fell for him.

2434
01:46:56,104 --> 01:46:57,144
It was so nice.

2435
01:46:57,243 --> 01:46:59,574
- So nice. What a performance. - What?

2436
01:46:59,673 --> 01:47:01,444
- I thought it was a music show. - I know.

2437
01:47:01,814 --> 01:47:05,184
It would be a good memory to sing together like that.

2438
01:47:07,824 --> 01:47:09,423
He was good as I heard.

2439
01:47:09,684 --> 01:47:12,752
Since he sang well in a relaxed way,

2440
01:47:12,753 --> 01:47:13,993
he looked cool.

2441
01:47:14,194 --> 01:47:18,264
The emotions Se Seung delivered were very good.

2442
01:47:18,593 --> 01:47:21,604
I could tell that she was absorbed in the lyrics.

2443
01:47:22,034 --> 01:47:23,833
I thought, "She is charming."

2444
01:47:24,333 --> 01:47:25,333
How pretty.

2445
01:47:25,774 --> 01:47:27,173
They are really good.

2446
01:47:27,673 --> 01:47:29,702
- Se Seung, you can sing so well. - Se Seung, how do you sing so well?

2447
01:47:29,703 --> 01:47:31,273
- Both of them can sing well. - It was insane.

2448
01:47:31,274 --> 01:47:32,573
It was really cool. Have a drink.

2449
01:47:32,574 --> 01:47:34,113
- They were like singers. - It was really cool.

2450
01:47:34,114 --> 01:47:35,683
- Have a drink. - Have a drink.

2451
01:47:35,684 --> 01:47:37,524
- It was great. - They nailed the performance.

2452
01:47:37,814 --> 01:47:39,413
- Cheers. - What are we going to do?

2453
01:47:39,614 --> 01:47:41,252
- Cheers. - My goodness.

2454
01:47:41,253 --> 01:47:42,724
They nailed the performance.

2455
01:47:44,284 --> 01:47:45,893
When I was passing by during practice,

2456
01:47:45,894 --> 01:47:49,593
I saw Yong Woo do the "Hype Boy" dance.

2457
01:47:50,264 --> 01:47:51,332
I think it would be better to hurry up and go.

2458
01:47:51,333 --> 01:47:53,264
If you perform fast, you can enjoy the food.

2459
01:47:53,564 --> 01:47:55,302
I thought it would be much better...

2460
01:47:55,303 --> 01:47:58,273
to perform after Jaurim's song, not "Hype Boy."

2461
01:47:58,274 --> 01:47:59,604
I was a bit nervous.

2462
01:48:00,173 --> 01:48:02,703
Ji Won didn't seem to be very nervous.

2463
01:48:03,144 --> 01:48:04,849
Let's do this quickly and go back to eating food.

2464
01:48:04,873 --> 01:48:05,873
Seriously.

2465
01:48:05,874 --> 01:48:06,973
- Do it quickly and eat comfortably. - Yun Jae, let's go.

2466
01:48:06,974 --> 01:48:08,082
- Ji Won, let's go. - Let's go.

2467
01:48:08,083 --> 01:48:09,684
- Good luck. - Let's go.

2468
01:48:10,614 --> 01:48:13,153
Not knowing what to do,

2469
01:48:13,154 --> 01:48:15,684
we must have sung about 40 songs.

2470
01:48:18,253 --> 01:48:20,323
- I can't wait. - They don't disappoint.

2471
01:48:20,324 --> 01:48:22,864
The song title is "Dear. My Fool."

2472
01:48:23,364 --> 01:48:26,162
She asked me just now, "What was the song title?"

2473
01:48:26,163 --> 01:48:28,503
Seriously. Since I am performing with a fool,

2474
01:48:29,003 --> 01:48:30,233
I will just give an adequate performance.

2475
01:48:30,234 --> 01:48:32,132
- From a fool to a fool. - You are cool.

2476
01:48:32,133 --> 01:48:33,833
She is Kim Ji Won and I am Kim Yun Jae.

2477
01:48:35,644 --> 01:48:37,274
He is really cool.

2478
01:48:38,114 --> 01:48:39,974
Let's hurry up and go eat. I am hungry.

2479
01:48:40,114 --> 01:48:41,813
(Trembling)

2480
01:48:41,814 --> 01:48:43,813
- What? - You must be flustered.

2481
01:48:43,814 --> 01:48:45,114
(He fails to act cool.)

2482
01:48:46,984 --> 01:48:49,824
("Dear. My Fool" by Yun Jae and Ji Won)

2483
01:48:51,824 --> 01:48:53,154
(Trembling)

2484
01:48:53,253 --> 01:48:54,292
Let's just give an adequate performance.

2485
01:48:54,293 --> 01:48:55,663
(Nervous)

2486
01:48:55,963 --> 01:48:57,293
(Suppressing her laughter)

2487
01:49:05,574 --> 01:49:07,203
What?

2488
01:49:41,543 --> 01:49:44,274
Her voice was very nice.

2489
01:49:44,373 --> 01:49:45,843
When she sang the first line,

2490
01:49:45,944 --> 01:49:48,514
I could focus right away.

2491
01:50:01,564 --> 01:50:03,323
(She tries to have sad thoughts.)

2492
01:50:03,324 --> 01:50:05,163
"We are ruined."

2493
01:50:10,703 --> 01:50:11,703
(Glaring)

2494
01:50:29,184 --> 01:50:31,752
I was surprised because he sang with seriousness.

2495
01:50:31,753 --> 01:50:33,394
I thought that he would be embarrassed.

2496
01:50:35,163 --> 01:50:37,492
He had a unique singing style.

2497
01:50:37,493 --> 01:50:39,253
It seemed like he was pulling out his voice.

2498
01:50:40,734 --> 01:50:43,803
I think it was similar to the trot singing style.

2499
01:50:44,404 --> 01:50:45,884
(She misses the beat while laughing.)

2500
01:51:36,953 --> 01:51:38,053
Go.

2501
01:52:08,154 --> 01:52:11,083
(They wrap up by pretending to make eye contact.)

2502
01:52:12,993 --> 01:52:14,024
Well done.

2503
01:52:14,324 --> 01:52:15,662
- They did so well. - It was cool.

2504
01:52:15,663 --> 01:52:17,463
They did so well.

2505
01:52:20,734 --> 01:52:22,103
- What was that? - What was that?

2506
01:52:22,104 --> 01:52:24,434
- You pretended to be a bad singer. - What was that?

2507
01:52:24,633 --> 01:52:26,033
- Gosh. - Seriously.

2508
01:52:26,034 --> 01:52:28,002
- Seriously. - We kept laughing.

2509
01:52:28,003 --> 01:52:29,172
The song...

2510
01:52:29,173 --> 01:52:31,774
- How did you do so well? - What was that?

2511
01:52:31,944 --> 01:52:34,473
Ji Won could sing very well.

2512
01:52:34,474 --> 01:52:38,514
She had a voice that made me pay attention.

2513
01:52:38,614 --> 01:52:41,724
It pulled me in and made me go, "What? I see."

2514
01:52:42,053 --> 01:52:44,583
Is Jae Hyung thinking, "Is she my woman?"

2515
01:52:45,953 --> 01:52:47,123
Jae Hyung is going, "I see."

2516
01:52:47,553 --> 01:52:49,893
The way they look at each other makes my heart flutter.

2517
01:52:49,894 --> 01:52:51,292
It's romantic.

2518
01:52:51,293 --> 01:52:52,863
I think this team is more impressive.

2519
01:52:52,864 --> 01:52:54,863
- Why? - They had a flat tire.

2520
01:52:54,864 --> 01:52:55,864
That's right.

2521
01:52:55,865 --> 01:52:57,632
- Adversities and hardships. - They overcame that problem...

2522
01:52:57,633 --> 01:52:58,872
and sang this song.

2523
01:52:58,873 --> 01:53:00,702
- That's right. - Ordeals make people stronger.

2524
01:53:00,703 --> 01:53:02,773
I know. They became stronger.

2525
01:53:02,774 --> 01:53:04,372
- We need to give them our approval. - They have my approval.

2526
01:53:04,373 --> 01:53:07,713
Everyone listened well, so I was grateful.

2527
01:53:07,814 --> 01:53:10,494
I should have prepared it better. It's too bad that I didn't do it.

2528
01:53:10,713 --> 01:53:12,729
(How would you feel about the 2nd Duet Contest with Siblings?)

2529
01:53:12,753 --> 01:53:15,883
I don't prefer duet performances.

2530
01:53:16,123 --> 01:53:17,123
Seriously.

2531
01:53:17,124 --> 01:53:18,592
- They are actually soft inside. - You did well.

2532
01:53:18,593 --> 01:53:19,724
They did so well.

2533
01:53:19,993 --> 01:53:21,723
- They did well. - It was a feint.

2534
01:53:21,724 --> 01:53:22,724
Seriously.

2535
01:53:22,725 --> 01:53:24,992
- I should have known. - This is insane.

2536
01:53:24,993 --> 01:53:26,264
We should hurry up and do it.

2537
01:53:28,564 --> 01:53:29,833
It's like that.

2538
01:53:30,333 --> 01:53:31,803
They prepared something.

2539
01:53:31,873 --> 01:53:33,233
They prepared something.

2540
01:53:33,234 --> 01:53:34,673
What? They prepared something.

2541
01:53:35,243 --> 01:53:36,703
Hello, I am Cheol Hyeon.

2542
01:53:36,904 --> 01:53:39,213
- I am Cho A. - We are the Park siblings.

2543
01:53:40,774 --> 01:53:42,613
All right. It's finally their turn.

2544
01:53:42,614 --> 01:53:43,614
The Park siblings.

2545
01:53:44,684 --> 01:53:48,224
We will sing "Aloha" by COOL.

2546
01:53:48,824 --> 01:53:50,623
We chose this song...

2547
01:53:51,593 --> 01:53:54,423
because Cho A and I listened to it when we went on a trip together.

2548
01:53:54,524 --> 01:53:55,593
It has nice lyrics.

2549
01:53:55,694 --> 01:53:58,992
It's a song that is meaningful to us,

2550
01:53:58,993 --> 01:54:00,133
so we chose it.

2551
01:54:01,293 --> 01:54:03,404
Don't look forward to us. I really can't sing.

2552
01:54:03,503 --> 01:54:04,503
Good luck.

2553
01:54:04,803 --> 01:54:05,803
They are just cool.

2554
01:54:05,904 --> 01:54:06,904
They look natural no matter what they do.

2555
01:54:06,905 --> 01:54:08,385
- They are just cool. - That's right.

2556
01:54:08,444 --> 01:54:09,643
They look like singers now.

2557
01:54:09,644 --> 01:54:11,474
Seriously. I feel like I am watching TV.

2558
01:54:11,814 --> 01:54:14,613
My heart is beating so fast.

2559
01:54:14,614 --> 01:54:16,943
Since everyone was a talented singer,

2560
01:54:16,944 --> 01:54:18,854
we decided to keep it cute.

2561
01:54:21,724 --> 01:54:23,753
(She picks up her weapon.)

2562
01:54:24,453 --> 01:54:26,524
- How cute. - How cute.

2563
01:54:27,753 --> 01:54:29,863
- What? - My goodness.

2564
01:54:29,864 --> 01:54:32,394
(He missed the first note since he was focused on the weapon.)

2565
01:54:36,364 --> 01:54:37,364
How cute.

2566
01:54:39,373 --> 01:54:40,534
He can sing well.

2567
01:55:48,074 --> 01:55:51,243
As I sang, I thought to myself, "This performance is lacking.'

2568
01:55:51,343 --> 01:55:53,114
"We shouldn't sing like this."

2569
01:55:53,814 --> 01:55:55,944
(Inching closer)

2570
01:56:03,553 --> 01:56:04,553
I am so nervous.

2571
01:56:05,923 --> 01:56:07,792
- Say something. - They are so sweet.

2572
01:56:07,793 --> 01:56:09,693
- Seriously. They are so sweet. - My goodness.

2573
01:56:09,694 --> 01:56:11,734
I can't promise it with words.

2574
01:56:11,993 --> 01:56:13,533
But I love you only.

2575
01:56:13,534 --> 01:56:16,203
- It's a narration. - What's up with the narration?

2576
01:56:16,864 --> 01:56:19,534
(The rap part turned into a narration.)

2577
01:56:19,974 --> 01:56:21,104
They are really good.

2578
01:56:21,743 --> 01:56:23,074
They are really good.

2579
01:56:35,953 --> 01:56:37,053
Don't be too nervous.

2580
01:56:38,184 --> 01:56:39,194
Shall I go?

2581
01:56:39,724 --> 01:56:42,122
I must have gotten on Cho A's nerves since I kept sticking to her side.

2582
01:56:42,123 --> 01:56:43,593
She told me to leave.

2583
01:56:45,564 --> 01:56:46,962
She looked very embarrassed.

2584
01:56:46,963 --> 01:56:49,080
She is physically affectionate with her younger brother,

2585
01:56:49,104 --> 01:56:51,163
but she became awkward on the stage.

2586
01:56:51,404 --> 01:56:52,832
It looked very cute.

2587
01:56:52,833 --> 01:56:55,203
Cheol Hyeon was incredibly cute as always.

2588
01:57:24,034 --> 01:57:26,632
When I talk in front of a crowd,

2589
01:57:26,633 --> 01:57:27,702
I sound like a goat.

2590
01:57:27,703 --> 01:57:30,143
- I get very nervous. - How cute.

2591
01:57:30,144 --> 01:57:31,943
But I enjoyed myself.

2592
01:57:31,944 --> 01:57:34,474
When I met eyes with people,

2593
01:57:34,644 --> 01:57:36,412
they took photos...

2594
01:57:36,413 --> 01:57:38,614
and found the performance cute.

2595
01:57:38,753 --> 01:57:43,023
I thought that I wouldn't be embarrassed even if I messed up.

2596
01:57:43,024 --> 01:57:44,284
I just felt reassured.

2597
01:57:44,724 --> 01:57:48,324
Despite the embarrassment, it would be a good memory to us.

2598
01:57:48,394 --> 01:57:51,463
I could depend on my sister because she was performing with me.

2599
01:57:52,364 --> 01:57:53,463
I think that was the case.

2600
01:57:54,194 --> 01:57:56,203
- Thank you. - All right.

2601
01:57:56,764 --> 01:57:57,764
That was great.

2602
01:58:00,034 --> 01:58:01,034
I am embarrassed.

2603
01:58:01,035 --> 01:58:03,302
- It was cute. - It was cute.

2604
01:58:03,303 --> 01:58:04,543
Seriously.

2605
01:58:05,814 --> 01:58:07,614
It warmed up my heart.

2606
01:58:08,484 --> 01:58:11,013
- The performance was so touching. - Seriously.

2607
01:58:11,014 --> 01:58:13,513
- They performed with seriousness. - I know.

2608
01:58:13,514 --> 01:58:16,383
I think we will be even more touched by the "Hype Boy" performance.

2609
01:58:17,484 --> 01:58:18,653
- The "Hype Boy" performance... - I am so curious about it.

2610
01:58:18,654 --> 01:58:19,792
Will be the most touching.

2611
01:58:19,793 --> 01:58:21,593
This is such a therapeutic moment for me.

2612
01:58:21,923 --> 01:58:24,163
If you are ready, take the stage.

2613
01:58:24,293 --> 01:58:25,694
- All right. - You are cool.

2614
01:58:27,894 --> 01:58:29,333
What did they prepare?

2615
01:58:30,503 --> 01:58:32,034
(Putting on a hat)

2616
01:58:32,333 --> 01:58:34,333
What is up with that cuteness?

2617
01:58:36,474 --> 01:58:38,003
Why are their legs so long?

2618
01:58:38,614 --> 01:58:39,713
How do I look, Yong Woo?

2619
01:58:42,383 --> 01:58:44,213
I wasn't very nervous.

2620
01:58:44,583 --> 01:58:48,314
I hoped that it would give Ju Yeon good memories.

2621
01:58:48,413 --> 01:58:50,323
I hoped that she would unleash her talent...

2622
01:58:50,324 --> 01:58:51,894
while I made a fool of myself.

2623
01:58:54,253 --> 01:58:55,592
It was so cute.

2624
01:58:55,593 --> 01:58:58,733
They also looked cool when they entered.

2625
01:58:58,734 --> 01:59:00,194
They were easy on the eyes.

2626
01:59:00,564 --> 01:59:04,662
I think Yong Woo and Ju Yeon will do something unique.

2627
01:59:04,663 --> 01:59:07,873
I have a feeling that they will come up with a fun idea.

2628
01:59:08,133 --> 01:59:09,873
They will show us something.

2629
01:59:10,303 --> 01:59:13,673
Our group name is My LookalikeJeans.

2630
01:59:15,114 --> 01:59:16,114
All right.

2631
01:59:16,843 --> 01:59:18,853
- You are cool. - Really?

2632
01:59:18,854 --> 01:59:19,854
Ju Yeon.

2633
01:59:19,855 --> 01:59:21,660
How do I get to the Hongik University Station?

2634
01:59:21,684 --> 01:59:23,552
"Hype Boy" by My LookalikeJeans.

2635
01:59:23,553 --> 01:59:25,452
(The 1st Duet Contest with Siblings)

2636
01:59:25,453 --> 01:59:27,823
It would be incredible if Yong Woo can dance well.

2637
01:59:27,824 --> 01:59:29,023
("Hype Boy" by Yong Woo and Ju Yeon)

2638
01:59:29,024 --> 01:59:30,462
- What? - What?

2639
01:59:30,463 --> 01:59:32,194
- What? - This is insane.

2640
01:59:58,824 --> 02:00:01,093
(They say that I have been sensitive lately)

2641
02:00:15,574 --> 02:00:16,604
That's incredible.

2642
02:00:20,014 --> 02:00:21,444
How cute!

2643
02:00:30,083 --> 02:00:31,123
What's going on?

2644
02:01:16,404 --> 02:01:17,604
- What? - What?

2645
02:01:18,803 --> 02:01:19,974
My goodness.

2646
02:01:21,303 --> 02:01:22,404
Will he dance?

2647
02:01:22,644 --> 02:01:23,644
(Getting ready)

2648
02:01:23,645 --> 02:01:24,673
I can't wait.

2649
02:01:25,814 --> 02:01:26,843
Wait.

2650
02:01:42,524 --> 02:01:44,564
It brought shock and panic.

2651
02:01:44,793 --> 02:01:46,662
The ivory V-neck sweater...

2652
02:01:46,663 --> 02:01:48,803
and his movements got etched in my brain.

2653
02:01:49,034 --> 02:01:50,303
He was like Park Jin Young.

2654
02:02:12,953 --> 02:02:14,453
One, two, three. Salute.

2655
02:02:15,764 --> 02:02:17,223
(Duet Contest with Siblings)

2656
02:02:17,224 --> 02:02:18,224
Thank you.

2657
02:02:20,564 --> 02:02:22,802
- They nailed the performance. - It felt good.

2658
02:02:22,803 --> 02:02:25,973
Ju Yeon and I made an unforgettable memory.

2659
02:02:25,974 --> 02:02:27,703
I will remember the moment for a long time.

2660
02:02:27,934 --> 02:02:30,103
- That was great. - I couldn't do this.

2661
02:02:30,104 --> 02:02:32,444
- I see why they kept quiet. - I should have done this.

2662
02:02:33,474 --> 02:02:34,713
He is so charming.

2663
02:02:34,974 --> 02:02:37,042
I like men who can dance.

2664
02:02:37,043 --> 02:02:39,412
I also like that he can enjoy music.

2665
02:02:39,413 --> 02:02:40,453
Was Cho A...

2666
02:02:41,154 --> 02:02:42,460
outside when she watched the performance?

2667
02:02:42,484 --> 02:02:43,553
My goodness.

2668
02:02:44,984 --> 02:02:46,453
Wasn't she in the same place?

2669
02:02:48,724 --> 02:02:49,962
I don't know what to say.

2670
02:02:49,963 --> 02:02:52,364
- Jonathan, it's the power of love. - I mean...

2671
02:02:52,463 --> 02:02:53,592
It's the power of love.

2672
02:02:53,593 --> 02:02:55,903
- That's right. - It's the power of love.

2673
02:02:55,904 --> 02:02:57,662
- The power of love. - I thought she stepped outside.

2674
02:02:57,663 --> 02:02:59,673
- The power of love. - They are so cute.

2675
02:02:59,873 --> 02:03:01,279
- Seriously. - All of them are cute.

2676
02:03:01,303 --> 02:03:03,503
- Do anything you want to do. - Thank you.

2677
02:03:03,673 --> 02:03:05,543
The vibe was insane.

2678
02:03:05,843 --> 02:03:07,474
They ripped up the stage.

2679
02:03:07,774 --> 02:03:09,514
They split up the stage.

2680
02:03:09,684 --> 02:03:10,784
It was like the Red Sea.

2681
02:03:11,684 --> 02:03:15,154
Yong Woo is doing everything he wants to do on this show.

2682
02:03:16,524 --> 02:03:18,583
- My goodness. - It was incredible.

2683
02:03:19,253 --> 02:03:20,592
It was great.

2684
02:03:20,593 --> 02:03:21,622
They nailed the performance.

2685
02:03:21,623 --> 02:03:23,769
- Seriously, what was that? - They nailed the performance.

2686
02:03:23,793 --> 02:03:25,162
- They were so cute. - They nailed the performance.

2687
02:03:25,163 --> 02:03:27,462
At a glance, it seemed like Yong Woo was entertaining Ju Yeon.

2688
02:03:27,463 --> 02:03:28,803
But I think...

2689
02:03:29,534 --> 02:03:31,934
Yong Woo did it to show his charms.

2690
02:03:32,234 --> 02:03:36,342
I can't say that he entertained her because he shook his hips hard.

2691
02:03:36,343 --> 02:03:37,403
(I see.)

2692
02:03:37,404 --> 02:03:38,944
He was showing off his charms.

2693
02:03:39,373 --> 02:03:41,143
He acted like he had no choice,

2694
02:03:41,144 --> 02:03:43,713
but he enjoyed the performance even more.

2695
02:03:44,314 --> 02:03:45,814
I think he wanted to do it.

2696
02:03:46,083 --> 02:03:47,412
He was like Rain.

2697
02:03:47,413 --> 02:03:50,922
I was reminded of "How To Avoid the Sun."

2698
02:03:50,923 --> 02:03:53,093
I had to admit that he was cool. He was really cool.

2699
02:04:05,434 --> 02:04:07,173
(Blinded by love)

2700
02:04:08,234 --> 02:04:09,803
Were the siblings outside?

2701
02:04:11,774 --> 02:04:13,242
They were outside the Earth's atmosphere.

2702
02:04:13,243 --> 02:04:14,274
I see.

2703
02:04:14,574 --> 02:04:16,582
Yong Woo, aren't you too cool?

2704
02:04:16,583 --> 02:04:17,613
Did I do okay?

2705
02:04:17,614 --> 02:04:19,013
- We should learn the dance. - You were really cool.

2706
02:04:19,014 --> 02:04:20,483
- We should learn the dance. - Please teach us.

2707
02:04:20,484 --> 02:04:21,582
We should learn the "Hype Boy" dance.

2708
02:04:21,583 --> 02:04:23,929
I simply copied the dance moves while watching the performance.

2709
02:04:23,953 --> 02:04:25,383
- It was so cute. - Seriously.

2710
02:04:26,423 --> 02:04:27,493
It was so cute.

2711
02:04:28,293 --> 02:04:30,894
You stood up then.

2712
02:04:32,434 --> 02:04:33,863
(The 1st Duet Contest with Siblings)

2713
02:04:33,864 --> 02:04:35,363
(Send the names of the siblings who showed the best performance.)

2714
02:04:35,364 --> 02:04:36,962
(You can't vote for your own team.)

2715
02:04:36,963 --> 02:04:38,604
- We need to do it now. - Vote.

2716
02:04:42,104 --> 02:04:44,103
Without a second of hesitation,

2717
02:04:44,104 --> 02:04:46,543
I picked Ju Yeon and Yong Woo.

2718
02:04:46,774 --> 02:04:49,114
I picked Ju Yeon and Yong Woo right away.

2719
02:04:49,444 --> 02:04:51,943
They had cool looks.

2720
02:04:51,944 --> 02:04:55,014
They looked pretty the moment they sat down.

2721
02:04:55,314 --> 02:04:57,000
Everything was nice. The performance was nice to watch.

2722
02:04:57,024 --> 02:04:59,293
Ju Yeon and Yong Woo did so well.

2723
02:04:59,453 --> 02:05:00,922
I gave it some thought.

2724
02:05:00,923 --> 02:05:02,492
I knew that the "Hype Boy" performance...

2725
02:05:02,493 --> 02:05:04,064
would receive a lot of votes,

2726
02:05:04,194 --> 02:05:06,563
so I voted for Jae Hyung and Se Seung...

2727
02:05:06,564 --> 02:05:10,534
since I enjoyed their singing.

2728
02:05:11,003 --> 02:05:13,172
I think other people did better...

2729
02:05:13,173 --> 02:05:15,843
when it came to singing and playing the musical instrument.

2730
02:05:16,104 --> 02:05:18,042
But the siblings who gave a touching performance...

2731
02:05:18,043 --> 02:05:19,974
people could relate to...

2732
02:05:20,373 --> 02:05:23,083
were Cho A and Cheol Hyeon, in my opinion.

2733
02:05:23,413 --> 02:05:26,684
In terms of the audience's cheers and satisfaction,

2734
02:05:26,883 --> 02:05:29,553
Yong Woo and Ju Yeon would get more points.

2735
02:05:30,453 --> 02:05:31,583
Seriously.

2736
02:05:31,883 --> 02:05:34,593
But I think we did the best job...

2737
02:05:34,993 --> 02:05:37,793
in putting in our hearts and emotions.

2738
02:05:38,123 --> 02:05:40,264
I voted for Jae Hyung and Se Seung.

2739
02:05:40,564 --> 02:05:43,002
(Did the vote contain your favouritism?)

2740
02:05:43,003 --> 02:05:44,202
A lot.

2741
02:05:44,203 --> 02:05:45,534
It would be a lie to say no.

2742
02:05:45,873 --> 02:05:48,203
Votes shouldn't contain your personal feelings.

2743
02:05:48,373 --> 02:05:51,343
You should judge the performance by itself.

2744
02:05:58,984 --> 02:06:02,382
(Who will be the winners of the 1st Duet Contest with Siblings?)

2745
02:06:02,383 --> 02:06:04,183
Thank you for the effort you put into learning the dance.

2746
02:06:04,184 --> 02:06:05,184
Thank you.

2747
02:06:05,583 --> 02:06:06,993
It wasn't easy.

2748
02:06:07,493 --> 02:06:09,694
- In a day... - This part wasn't easy.

2749
02:06:09,824 --> 02:06:10,824
Seriously.

2750
02:06:10,825 --> 02:06:12,434
You did that part the best.

2751
02:06:13,364 --> 02:06:14,364
What?

2752
02:06:14,864 --> 02:06:16,263
- My goodness. - The first place.

2753
02:06:16,264 --> 02:06:18,103
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2754
02:06:18,104 --> 02:06:19,832
- All right. - She got chosen.

2755
02:06:19,833 --> 02:06:20,933
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2756
02:06:20,934 --> 02:06:21,934
Thank you.

2757
02:06:21,935 --> 02:06:23,373
I got chosen.

2758
02:06:23,774 --> 02:06:25,403
- How lovely. - I was sitting at the front.

2759
02:06:25,404 --> 02:06:26,412
Let's hear it.

2760
02:06:26,413 --> 02:06:27,413
(Gulping)

2761
02:06:27,414 --> 02:06:28,443
Who won?

2762
02:06:28,444 --> 02:06:29,913
- It's very thick. - Please read it.

2763
02:06:30,213 --> 02:06:31,284
Is it thick?

2764
02:06:31,543 --> 02:06:33,484
The fact that it's thick makes me scared.

2765
02:06:33,784 --> 02:06:35,183
The Grand Prize...

2766
02:06:35,184 --> 02:06:38,053
of the First Duet Contest with Siblings goes to...

2767
02:06:38,623 --> 02:06:39,654
The Grand Prize?

2768
02:06:41,753 --> 02:06:43,024
Who will it be?

2769
02:06:44,064 --> 02:06:46,534
Lee Yong Woo and Lee Ju Yeon.

2770
02:06:48,833 --> 02:06:50,103
Of course.

2771
02:06:50,104 --> 02:06:51,703
(Disappointed)

2772
02:06:52,503 --> 02:06:53,503
Hold on.

2773
02:06:53,504 --> 02:06:54,603
(Celebrating with a ceremony)

2774
02:06:54,604 --> 02:06:55,973
Yes.

2775
02:06:55,974 --> 02:06:56,974
(The restaurant owner shyly gives them flowers.)

2776
02:06:56,975 --> 02:06:58,502
- My goodness. - Accept the flowers.

2777
02:06:58,503 --> 02:06:59,573
My goodness.

2778
02:06:59,574 --> 02:07:02,213
- There are flowers too. - My goodness.

2779
02:07:03,743 --> 02:07:05,912
- Thank you. - And...

2780
02:07:05,913 --> 02:07:07,313
- Okay. - Thank you.

2781
02:07:07,314 --> 02:07:10,053
- The Excellence Prize. - The Excellence Prize.

2782
02:07:11,684 --> 02:07:13,284
Make it louder for the Excellence Prize.

2783
02:07:14,923 --> 02:07:15,963
Make it louder.

2784
02:07:16,224 --> 02:07:19,092
It goes to Park Jae Hyung and Park Se Seung.

2785
02:07:19,093 --> 02:07:20,163
My goodness.

2786
02:07:23,604 --> 02:07:25,234
All right.

2787
02:07:25,633 --> 02:07:26,904
I should have danced.

2788
02:07:27,234 --> 02:07:28,404
You know how to dance.

2789
02:07:29,243 --> 02:07:31,372
- You should have danced. - There is the second one.

2790
02:07:31,373 --> 02:07:33,542
"The Singapore Date Selection will be made..."

2791
02:07:33,543 --> 02:07:35,144
"with the flight tickets."

2792
02:07:36,243 --> 02:07:39,853
"Hand over the ticket to the one you want to go on a date with..."

2793
02:07:39,854 --> 02:07:41,784
"right now."

2794
02:07:43,154 --> 02:07:45,283
"The Grand Prize winners, Yong Woo and Ju Yeon..."

2795
02:07:45,284 --> 02:07:46,423
"will get two tickets."

2796
02:07:46,854 --> 02:07:50,224
"Jae Hyung and Se Seung will get one ticket."

2797
02:07:50,963 --> 02:07:53,962
That means we have to hand over the tickets...

2798
02:07:53,963 --> 02:07:57,564
- openly. - It seems that way.

2799
02:07:57,703 --> 02:07:59,003
That's intense.

2800
02:07:59,434 --> 02:08:01,803
I will hand over the tickets.

2801
02:08:01,904 --> 02:08:03,802
- Right now? - Right now? Right there?

2802
02:08:03,803 --> 02:08:06,742
- While everyone is watching. - My goodness.

2803
02:08:06,743 --> 02:08:08,172
- Right here? - This is...

2804
02:08:08,173 --> 02:08:10,243
- Right now? - Shouldn't we turn off the light?

2805
02:08:10,843 --> 02:08:12,653
It wasn't a secret message,

2806
02:08:12,654 --> 02:08:14,952
but an open message.

2807
02:08:14,953 --> 02:08:18,083
Wouldn't Jae Hyung give it to Se Seung?

2808
02:08:18,284 --> 02:08:21,654
After all, Ju Yeon has a chance.

2809
02:08:22,093 --> 02:08:24,792
I wanted to use it on Jae Hyung right away.

2810
02:08:24,793 --> 02:08:27,833
But I was very embarrassed about giving it to him.

2811
02:08:27,993 --> 02:08:30,734
Wait. Does it involve going on a date there?

2812
02:08:32,064 --> 02:08:33,904
I am right. It involves going on a date there.

2813
02:08:34,173 --> 02:08:37,343
The atmosphere was a bit strange.

2814
02:08:37,604 --> 02:08:40,172
People who were watching felt entertained...

2815
02:08:40,173 --> 02:08:43,083
and nervous at the same time.

2816
02:08:43,843 --> 02:08:46,814
A ticket? Does that mean we will sit next to each other?

2817
02:08:47,083 --> 02:08:48,713
I guess we are really going.

2818
02:08:49,154 --> 02:08:50,274
I guess we are really going.

2819
02:08:53,724 --> 02:08:56,093
- You should go first. - Okay.

2820
02:08:57,264 --> 02:08:58,694
It feels awkward.

2821
02:08:59,293 --> 02:09:00,592
It has nothing to do with me.

2822
02:09:00,593 --> 02:09:01,663
(Whispering)

2823
02:09:05,264 --> 02:09:06,274
What?

2824
02:09:06,774 --> 02:09:07,873
You will see.

2825
02:09:08,303 --> 02:09:10,143
In that case...

2826
02:09:10,144 --> 02:09:11,943
To whom will you give the ticket?

2827
02:09:11,944 --> 02:09:12,973
Well,

2828
02:09:12,974 --> 02:09:15,814
I intended to go on a date with her prior to this,

2829
02:09:16,144 --> 02:09:17,583
but it didn't work out.

2830
02:09:17,944 --> 02:09:19,912
I want to make it happen.

2831
02:09:19,913 --> 02:09:22,284
So I will give it to Cho A.

2832
02:09:24,753 --> 02:09:25,833
So I will give it to Cho A.

2833
02:09:28,194 --> 02:09:30,923
- Thank you. - How romantic.

2834
02:09:32,064 --> 02:09:34,992
- He is cool. - Seriously.

2835
02:09:34,993 --> 02:09:37,803
Ju Yeon winked at me.

2836
02:09:38,133 --> 02:09:39,774
Give it to her with the flowers.

2837
02:09:41,974 --> 02:09:43,573
It would have been too simple to give her the ticket only.

2838
02:09:43,574 --> 02:09:44,973
I thought it was a good idea...

2839
02:09:44,974 --> 02:09:46,254
to give her the flowers as well.

2840
02:09:46,474 --> 02:09:49,684
I thought, "I have a great sister."

2841
02:09:50,343 --> 02:09:52,712
I entertained the idea of giving the flowers to Jae Hyung...

2842
02:09:52,713 --> 02:09:55,283
when I thought about the ways to deliver the ticket.

2843
02:09:55,284 --> 02:09:57,622
But I thought it would be prettier to have my brother give them...

2844
02:09:57,623 --> 02:09:59,493
to Cho A.

2845
02:09:59,724 --> 02:10:01,393
She yielded for her brother.

2846
02:10:01,394 --> 02:10:03,023
Ju Yeon is so nice.

2847
02:10:03,024 --> 02:10:04,092
- She is so nice. - I know.

2848
02:10:04,093 --> 02:10:05,422
- She is so nice. - She wanted to use the flowers,

2849
02:10:05,423 --> 02:10:06,763
but she gave them to her brother.

2850
02:10:06,764 --> 02:10:10,433
He was like, "I..." He acted like he had thought of it.

2851
02:10:10,434 --> 02:10:13,274
He gave them to Cho A in a natural way.

2852
02:10:14,133 --> 02:10:16,803
I was very happy. I was happy.

2853
02:10:16,904 --> 02:10:19,574
I thought, "They are cute siblings."

2854
02:10:19,713 --> 02:10:22,582
- How romantic. - My goodness.

2855
02:10:22,583 --> 02:10:24,313
How cool.

2856
02:10:24,314 --> 02:10:25,644
They are so thoughtful.

2857
02:10:25,843 --> 02:10:27,613
(You will go to Singapore with Yong Woo.)

2858
02:10:27,614 --> 02:10:29,654
I am looking forward to it.

2859
02:10:30,684 --> 02:10:33,893
I wonder what events await us.

2860
02:10:33,894 --> 02:10:35,524
I am excited too.

2861
02:10:35,753 --> 02:10:39,933
To be honest, I didn't know that Yong Woo would pick Cho A.

2862
02:10:39,934 --> 02:10:41,894
It never occurred to me.

2863
02:10:42,333 --> 02:10:44,803
I was nervous that he would pick Yun Ha.

2864
02:10:44,864 --> 02:10:47,333
(He was nervous all on his own.)

2865
02:10:48,333 --> 02:10:49,542
I intended to go...

2866
02:10:49,543 --> 02:10:51,474
(Twitching)

2867
02:10:51,604 --> 02:10:52,712
(So I will give it to Cho A.)

2868
02:10:52,713 --> 02:10:54,774
(My goodness)

2869
02:10:55,314 --> 02:10:56,683
When he picked Cho A,

2870
02:10:56,684 --> 02:10:58,513
I thought, "All right."

2871
02:10:58,514 --> 02:11:00,113
"This is a victory for me."

2872
02:11:00,114 --> 02:11:01,753
I had that thought.

2873
02:11:02,484 --> 02:11:03,723
(His heart is at ease.)

2874
02:11:03,724 --> 02:11:04,983
Let's eat.

2875
02:11:04,984 --> 02:11:06,353
Let's just drink.

2876
02:11:06,354 --> 02:11:08,724
- Give me that. Oh, it's here. - My goodness.

2877
02:11:09,154 --> 02:11:10,162
Did you pick your date?

2878
02:11:10,163 --> 02:11:12,563
If you picked your date, take a shot and deliver the ticket.

2879
02:11:12,963 --> 02:11:14,063
Deliver the ticket.

2880
02:11:14,064 --> 02:11:15,163
As for me...

2881
02:11:15,293 --> 02:11:16,332
Did you pick your date?

2882
02:11:16,333 --> 02:11:18,363
- All right. Let's have a drink. - Let's have a drink.

2883
02:11:18,364 --> 02:11:20,473
All right. Cheers.

2884
02:11:20,474 --> 02:11:21,533
Cheers.

2885
02:11:21,534 --> 02:11:22,774
Everyone is...

2886
02:11:25,373 --> 02:11:27,013
As for Ju Yeon,

2887
02:11:27,014 --> 02:11:29,143
there was a time...

2888
02:11:29,144 --> 02:11:31,343
she went on a date with Jae Hyung.

2889
02:11:31,444 --> 02:11:34,582
It seemed like she had fallen...

2890
02:11:34,583 --> 02:11:37,223
for Jae Hyung's charms.

2891
02:11:37,224 --> 02:11:40,493
So I thought that she would pick Jae Hyung.

2892
02:11:40,993 --> 02:11:43,324
As for me...

2893
02:11:43,963 --> 02:11:45,364
"As for me..."

2894
02:11:46,034 --> 02:11:47,934
I will give it to Jae Hyung.

2895
02:11:53,703 --> 02:11:55,734
I was so happy.

2896
02:11:55,873 --> 02:11:58,103
I was happy about...

2897
02:11:58,104 --> 02:12:01,574
having my first date in Singapore with Jae Hyung.

2898
02:12:03,284 --> 02:12:06,252
Seeing her pick Jae Hyung as her date...

2899
02:12:06,253 --> 02:12:07,984
made me certain.

2900
02:12:08,553 --> 02:12:12,583
Jae Hyung is the one I want to go on a date with.

2901
02:12:12,824 --> 02:12:17,163
"I see. Ju Yeon likes Jae Hyung."

2902
02:12:17,623 --> 02:12:21,234
I had that thought.

2903
02:12:22,364 --> 02:12:24,364
I felt a bit dejected.

2904
02:12:25,963 --> 02:12:27,904
It was like that.

2905
02:12:29,503 --> 02:12:31,604
Then Se Seung, you can use the ticket.

2906
02:12:32,873 --> 02:12:33,873
All right.

2907
02:12:33,874 --> 02:12:35,912
(Se Seung will be the last one to select her date.)

2908
02:12:35,913 --> 02:12:37,242
She relieved that worry.

2909
02:12:37,243 --> 02:12:39,713
- Ju Yeon relieved that worry. - That's right.

2910
02:12:40,553 --> 02:12:41,793
- That's right. - That's right.

2911
02:12:43,953 --> 02:12:44,983
- Did you make up your mind? - What?

2912
02:12:44,984 --> 02:12:46,923
- Do I need to pick right now? - Yes.

2913
02:12:47,194 --> 02:12:48,623
My throat is dry.

2914
02:12:48,824 --> 02:12:51,324
- My goodness. - Let's clink our glasses.

2915
02:12:52,993 --> 02:12:55,194
- Shall we clink our glasses? - Sure.

2916
02:12:55,593 --> 02:12:58,302
I had to pick my date...

2917
02:12:58,303 --> 02:13:02,034
and Jung Sub was my only choice.

2918
02:13:02,604 --> 02:13:06,543
But I wasn't sure it was the right choice for the both of us.

2919
02:13:07,474 --> 02:13:09,143
It seemed like...

2920
02:13:09,144 --> 02:13:12,753
our interest in each other had lessened.

2921
02:13:12,883 --> 02:13:15,082
I wasn't sure if it was the right thing...

2922
02:13:15,083 --> 02:13:17,053
to get pushed into this date.

2923
02:13:18,684 --> 02:13:19,753
I see.

2924
02:13:20,824 --> 02:13:23,763
She seemed to be confused.

2925
02:13:23,764 --> 02:13:26,492
She thought he was the one from the very beginning.

2926
02:13:26,493 --> 02:13:29,063
But the confusion that came...

2927
02:13:29,064 --> 02:13:32,774
continued to take effect.

2928
02:13:34,133 --> 02:13:36,303
(Se Seung continues to think hard.)

2929
02:13:37,203 --> 02:13:39,614
There is so much attention on me.

2930
02:13:41,514 --> 02:13:42,574
As for me,

2931
02:13:44,984 --> 02:13:47,184
I will give it to Jung Sub.

2932
02:13:47,854 --> 02:13:48,913
Thank you.

2933
02:13:51,724 --> 02:13:55,092
Everyone's attention was...

2934
02:13:55,093 --> 02:13:57,723
on my choice.

2935
02:13:57,724 --> 02:13:59,694
I couldn't avoid it.

2936
02:13:59,833 --> 02:14:01,792
I couldn't leave the room.

2937
02:14:01,793 --> 02:14:03,863
I thought, "Why am I stalling when I have no other choice?"

2938
02:14:03,864 --> 02:14:04,934
Then I gave it to him.

2939
02:14:06,003 --> 02:14:07,604
The answer was already decided.

2940
02:14:08,734 --> 02:14:10,502
- Did you receive it? - Did you receive it?

2941
02:14:10,503 --> 02:14:11,823
- I received it. - Are you happy?

2942
02:14:12,503 --> 02:14:13,514
I am happy.

2943
02:14:15,713 --> 02:14:17,382
It felt really nice.

2944
02:14:17,383 --> 02:14:20,513
It wasn't an anonymous message,

2945
02:14:20,514 --> 02:14:22,212
but a public decision.

2946
02:14:22,213 --> 02:14:24,083
I really felt like I was chosen.

2947
02:14:24,184 --> 02:14:26,253
Perhaps he could feel my hesitation.

2948
02:14:26,423 --> 02:14:28,193
I am sure he didn't feel it.

2949
02:14:28,194 --> 02:14:30,923
He probably thought that I was embarrassed.

2950
02:14:31,764 --> 02:14:33,533
They have different ideas of the situation.

2951
02:14:33,534 --> 02:14:35,063
They have no idea.

2952
02:14:35,064 --> 02:14:36,663
- About each other's thoughts. - Yes.

2953
02:14:37,404 --> 02:14:39,973
I think a trip to Singapore will be fun.

2954
02:14:39,974 --> 02:14:42,774
- Yes. - Which events await us?

2955
02:14:49,043 --> 02:14:51,013
Jae Hyung hasn't come back yet.

2956
02:14:51,014 --> 02:14:52,083
Jae Hyung.

2957
02:14:53,213 --> 02:14:55,513
- He is back. - Hurry up.

2958
02:14:55,514 --> 02:14:57,323
Run.

2959
02:14:57,324 --> 02:14:58,553
Run.

2960
02:14:59,123 --> 02:15:00,993
(The 1st Duet Contest with Siblings)

2961
02:15:04,993 --> 02:15:07,864
(The 1st Duet Contest with Siblings)

2962
02:15:08,264 --> 02:15:10,002
(Who do you like?)

2963
02:15:10,003 --> 02:15:12,534
(I am curious about Jae Hyung.)

2964
02:15:16,343 --> 02:15:19,542
(Ji Won plucked up her courage. I knew she would do that.)

2965
02:15:19,543 --> 02:15:20,842
(I don't know...)

2966
02:15:20,843 --> 02:15:22,843
(if this emotion is what I think it is.)

2967
02:15:24,543 --> 02:15:28,984
(As everyone's emotions change rapidly, )

2968
02:15:30,053 --> 02:15:31,183
All right.

2969
02:15:31,184 --> 02:15:35,292
(the last night in Seoul passes.)

2970
02:15:35,293 --> 02:15:36,823
(Cho A, where are you going?)

2971
02:15:36,824 --> 02:15:41,592
(I am going to Singapore for a date with Yong Woo.)

2972
02:15:41,593 --> 02:15:43,433
(I felt like we had become a couple.)

2973
02:15:43,434 --> 02:15:45,962
(Since I was travelling with the man I was interested in, )

2974
02:15:45,963 --> 02:15:48,372
(my heart fluttered a lot.)

2975
02:15:48,373 --> 02:15:49,973
(We are in Singapore.)

2976
02:15:49,974 --> 02:15:51,372
(Cho A was busy with work.)

2977
02:15:51,373 --> 02:15:53,113
(We couldn't find the time to meet.)

2978
02:15:53,114 --> 02:15:55,672
(So I have been waiting for a moment like this.)

2979
02:15:55,673 --> 02:15:58,042
(We will be able to talk for a long time.)

2980
02:15:58,043 --> 02:16:02,283
(- It's so pretty. - I know. It's so pretty.)

2981
02:16:02,284 --> 02:16:04,483
(My mood is improving.)

2982
02:16:04,484 --> 02:16:07,252
(I am so happy right now. What am I going to do?)

2983
02:16:07,253 --> 02:16:08,823
(It's so tasty.)

2984
02:16:08,824 --> 02:16:12,963
(I can't believe that we are here right now.)

2985
02:16:22,434 --> 02:16:26,714
(A new beginning in a new place)

2986
02:17:09,354 --> 02:17:10,884
- My goodness. - Attention.

2987
02:17:11,454 --> 02:17:12,454
Salute.

2988
02:17:14,794 --> 02:17:16,722
- Thank you. - How cute.

2989
02:17:16,723 --> 02:17:17,723
Thank you.

2990
02:17:18,124 --> 02:17:19,992
- How cool. - Ju Yeon danced well,

2991
02:17:19,993 --> 02:17:21,273
but Yong Woo danced even better.

2992
02:17:21,964 --> 02:17:23,034
It was cool.
