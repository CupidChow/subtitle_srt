1
00:00:02,125 --> 00:00:04,184
(Eight participants moved into one house.)

2
00:00:04,185 --> 00:00:05,594
(They are all siblings.)

3
00:00:05,595 --> 00:00:08,524
(When I moved in, my sibling was there.)

4
00:00:08,525 --> 00:00:10,394
(I had to act like I didn't know my sibling.)

5
00:00:10,395 --> 00:00:11,594
(It was so difficult for me.)

6
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:14,094
(I tried my utmost best to act.)

7
00:00:14,095 --> 00:00:15,636
(I don't know if it worked though.)

8
00:00:15,735 --> 00:00:18,135
(A letter arrives for them.)

9
00:00:18,136 --> 00:00:19,475
(Your first date...)

10
00:00:19,476 --> 00:00:21,305
(is Cupid Date.)

11
00:00:21,306 --> 00:00:23,574
(I need to pass the message to the woman...)

12
00:00:23,575 --> 00:00:26,044
(whom I think is the sibling of the man I want to date.)

13
00:00:26,045 --> 00:00:27,574
(I become Cupid of my sibling.)

14
00:00:27,575 --> 00:00:30,144
(The women wrote the Cupid Message...)

15
00:00:30,145 --> 00:00:34,886
(thinking about the man that they want to pass the message to.)

16
00:00:36,085 --> 00:00:38,055
(But 3 messages were delivered to Ju Yeon.)

17
00:00:38,056 --> 00:00:39,754
(Shocked)

18
00:00:39,755 --> 00:00:42,694
(And two siblings were revealed.)

19
00:00:42,695 --> 00:00:43,995
(Se Seung's sibling...)

20
00:00:43,996 --> 00:00:45,394
(is Jae Hyung.)

21
00:00:45,395 --> 00:00:47,894
(Park Se Seung and Park Jae Hyung)

22
00:00:47,895 --> 00:00:49,264
(Ju Yeon's sibling...)

23
00:00:49,265 --> 00:00:50,334
(is Yong Woo.)

24
00:00:50,335 --> 00:00:52,804
(Lee Ju Yeon and Lee Yong Woo)

25
00:00:52,805 --> 00:00:54,376
(You received three votes.)

26
00:00:54,475 --> 00:00:56,005
Like this?

27
00:00:56,805 --> 00:00:58,945
(Which one has good vibes?)

28
00:00:59,945 --> 00:01:00,945
(I think this is from Cho A.)

29
00:01:00,946 --> 00:01:01,985
(It looks like Cho A's, right?)

30
00:01:01,986 --> 00:01:05,685
(Yong Woo chose Cho A's message.)

31
00:01:05,686 --> 00:01:10,555
(What will happen to the remaining two messages?)

32
00:01:14,395 --> 00:01:16,725
(Jae Hyung enters the Siblings' Room.)

33
00:01:23,835 --> 00:01:25,176
(Surprised)

34
00:01:25,536 --> 00:01:26,635
(Satisfied with the cushion)

35
00:01:42,555 --> 00:01:45,656
It felt like I teleported or went through a portal to go...

36
00:01:45,995 --> 00:01:48,296
from the reality to somewhere else.

37
00:01:49,266 --> 00:01:51,694
Both my sister and I actually hugged plushies...

38
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:53,994
to sleep until we were slightly older.

39
00:01:53,995 --> 00:01:55,905
My sister and I had the same dolls,

40
00:01:55,906 --> 00:01:57,466
just in different colors.

41
00:01:58,005 --> 00:01:59,806
It reminded me of that.

42
00:02:00,205 --> 00:02:02,005
It made me wind down.

43
00:02:16,325 --> 00:02:18,455
(Se Seung, his younger sibling, enters.)

44
00:02:19,896 --> 00:02:20,924
(Han Hye Jin)

45
00:02:20,925 --> 00:02:22,396
- They... - What great actors.

46
00:02:23,325 --> 00:02:24,396
I agree.

47
00:02:25,135 --> 00:02:26,965
- They really are great actors. - Such great actors.

48
00:02:26,966 --> 00:02:28,536
- They fooled us completely. - Exactly.

49
00:02:28,705 --> 00:02:31,936
It seems like they came into the room...

50
00:02:32,005 --> 00:02:33,074
as soon as they met on the first day.

51
00:02:33,075 --> 00:02:34,105
Right.

52
00:02:35,306 --> 00:02:36,445
How is it?

53
00:02:36,605 --> 00:02:37,875
You were forcing yourself to be excited, right?

54
00:02:37,876 --> 00:02:39,616
- I wasn't forcing myself. - You weren't?

55
00:02:39,776 --> 00:02:41,014
Who did you text just now?

56
00:02:41,015 --> 00:02:43,385
Who did you think I would like?

57
00:02:43,586 --> 00:02:46,186
I picked Jung Sub.

58
00:02:46,216 --> 00:02:47,355
Why?

59
00:02:48,786 --> 00:02:51,925
First of all, he looked the kindest.

60
00:02:53,596 --> 00:02:56,895
That's right. I'm amazed that you know.

61
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:58,634
- I have a good hunch. - Exactly.

62
00:02:58,635 --> 00:02:59,694
I thought you were...

63
00:02:59,695 --> 00:03:01,134
- going to say Yong Woo. - But if...

64
00:03:01,135 --> 00:03:02,406
- What? - I said it too bluntly.

65
00:03:02,605 --> 00:03:04,105
I did think about him.

66
00:03:04,436 --> 00:03:08,205
Yong Woo is very cool and nice,

67
00:03:08,675 --> 00:03:11,146
- but I don't think he's your type. - He's not my type. You're right.

68
00:03:11,505 --> 00:03:12,716
I've never seen you...

69
00:03:13,415 --> 00:03:16,316
meet someone of that type.

70
00:03:16,985 --> 00:03:18,355
I revealed too much.

71
00:03:20,355 --> 00:03:21,455
You're right.

72
00:03:22,156 --> 00:03:23,225
It's fascinating.

73
00:03:23,455 --> 00:03:24,885
You really are my brother.

74
00:03:25,996 --> 00:03:29,424
- Just now, when Yong Woo... - I think you...

75
00:03:29,425 --> 00:03:30,966
suggested to swap our rooms,

76
00:03:31,126 --> 00:03:32,795
I thought, "Not Se Seung, please."

77
00:03:33,536 --> 00:03:36,635
I would have been fine if it were with other people,

78
00:03:36,836 --> 00:03:38,205
but...

79
00:03:38,575 --> 00:03:39,975
It was so annoying.

80
00:03:41,175 --> 00:03:42,345
- So what did you do... - We swapped in the end.

81
00:03:42,346 --> 00:03:43,575
when Yong Woo said that?

82
00:03:43,846 --> 00:03:46,575
- "Okay." - "That's great. Sure, why not?"

83
00:03:47,945 --> 00:03:50,616
(A few hours ago)

84
00:03:51,485 --> 00:03:53,414
(Yong Woo suggested to give up the nice room...)

85
00:03:53,415 --> 00:03:55,355
(for Ju Yeon and Se Seung.)

86
00:03:56,485 --> 00:03:59,555
(Jae Hyung quickly pretended to be a gentleman,)

87
00:03:59,556 --> 00:04:00,595
- Sure. - How is it?

88
00:04:00,596 --> 00:04:02,465
(but he was a bit flustered.)

89
00:04:02,466 --> 00:04:04,364
I don't know. So I wanted to ask you first.

90
00:04:04,365 --> 00:04:05,535
- I'm fine with it. - Are you okay with it?

91
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:06,595
- Yes. - Okay.

92
00:04:06,596 --> 00:04:09,105
(Internally, he was annoyed.)

93
00:04:09,665 --> 00:04:12,136
(His sister even followed him to his room.)

94
00:04:13,276 --> 00:04:16,276
(He somehow ended up being a good brother.)

95
00:04:16,545 --> 00:04:17,605
It's nice.

96
00:04:21,446 --> 00:04:22,586
You pretended to be a gentleman.

97
00:04:22,815 --> 00:04:24,315
- "As you wish." - And...

98
00:04:24,545 --> 00:04:26,386
Why did it have to be...

99
00:04:26,656 --> 00:04:27,785
"Why did it have to be her?"

100
00:04:27,786 --> 00:04:28,886
(Of all people, it was his sibling.)

101
00:04:30,786 --> 00:04:32,155
Why did you come here?

102
00:04:32,156 --> 00:04:34,625
Actually, I need to give you the card.

103
00:04:36,495 --> 00:04:37,925
But I have nothing to give you.

104
00:04:38,766 --> 00:04:40,096
I didn't get any.

105
00:04:41,036 --> 00:04:42,266
(Sighing)

106
00:04:43,466 --> 00:04:44,735
There's none for you.

107
00:04:45,435 --> 00:04:47,276
I'm sorry, but I have nothing to give you.

108
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:50,275
(Thinking)

109
00:04:50,276 --> 00:04:52,146
(Contemplating)

110
00:04:54,276 --> 00:04:55,386
It was a bit...

111
00:04:55,685 --> 00:04:58,215
I don't think it was to the point of disappointment.

112
00:04:58,216 --> 00:05:00,255
"Is that so?"

113
00:05:00,256 --> 00:05:02,156
"My goodness." Something like this?

114
00:05:02,425 --> 00:05:03,684
- That's disappointment. - We..

115
00:05:03,685 --> 00:05:06,656
- We call that disappointment. - We call that disappointment.

116
00:05:07,055 --> 00:05:08,326
- That's disappointment. - Yes.

117
00:05:09,665 --> 00:05:11,995
I should think about this carefully.

118
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:15,266
Whether it's because they didn't know we were siblings...

119
00:05:15,665 --> 00:05:19,076
or they didn't fancy me.

120
00:05:20,836 --> 00:05:23,345
- This... - So if they already knew...

121
00:05:23,346 --> 00:05:24,545
that we were siblings,

122
00:05:25,115 --> 00:05:27,846
- it means you aren't popular. - Do they know? Exactly.

123
00:05:28,146 --> 00:05:29,346
Which is it?

124
00:05:29,485 --> 00:05:31,786
That's highly likely.

125
00:05:32,315 --> 00:05:35,085
Even if someone likes you,

126
00:05:35,086 --> 00:05:37,184
they would never figure out that we are siblings.

127
00:05:37,185 --> 00:05:39,224
I think they will easily find out.

128
00:05:39,225 --> 00:05:41,555
Can you tell about the others?

129
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:42,825
- Yes. - You can?

130
00:05:42,826 --> 00:05:43,826
Yes.

131
00:05:44,696 --> 00:05:45,994
Really? I couldn't tell.

132
00:05:45,995 --> 00:05:47,635
I know which two are siblings.

133
00:05:47,636 --> 00:05:49,164
- How? Because of their looks? - Yes.

134
00:05:49,165 --> 00:05:50,435
- Really? - Yes.

135
00:05:52,336 --> 00:05:53,536
For me,

136
00:05:53,805 --> 00:05:56,005
I thought I figured it out at first.

137
00:05:56,006 --> 00:05:57,906
But my thoughts keep changing.

138
00:05:58,346 --> 00:06:00,174
- I... - "They look alike too."

139
00:06:00,175 --> 00:06:03,314
I became sure of it as soon as all eight of us...

140
00:06:03,315 --> 00:06:04,615
came together.

141
00:06:04,846 --> 00:06:08,786
The three pairs that I think are siblings...

142
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:11,256
are Jung Sub and Ju Yeon.

143
00:06:12,096 --> 00:06:14,495
Jung Sub is older and Ju Yeon is younger.

144
00:06:14,696 --> 00:06:17,864
Jung Sub and Ju Yeon clearly look like they're siblings.

145
00:06:17,865 --> 00:06:18,935
Their mood,

146
00:06:18,966 --> 00:06:20,935
their vibes, and their faces.

147
00:06:22,036 --> 00:06:26,105
And Yong Woo and Cho A.

148
00:06:26,435 --> 00:06:27,636
Cho A is older.

149
00:06:28,206 --> 00:06:32,115
Cheol Hyeon and Yun Ha.

150
00:06:32,415 --> 00:06:37,115
I'm not sure who is older.

151
00:06:37,485 --> 00:06:40,155
But I think...

152
00:06:40,156 --> 00:06:42,756
I just have a very good hunch...

153
00:06:43,925 --> 00:06:44,985
for now.

154
00:06:46,795 --> 00:06:49,364
How embarrassed would he be right now?

155
00:06:49,365 --> 00:06:50,794
Poor guy.

156
00:06:50,795 --> 00:06:52,465
"I think I just have a very good hunch."

157
00:06:52,466 --> 00:06:54,765
It's scary to be too confident sometimes.

158
00:06:54,766 --> 00:06:56,965
Exactly. He got everyone wrong.

159
00:06:56,966 --> 00:06:58,035
- That's right. - Right?

160
00:06:58,036 --> 00:07:00,405
Different from what we think and from the truth too.

161
00:07:00,406 --> 00:07:01,435
Exactly.

162
00:07:05,475 --> 00:07:08,845
(Se Seung, who delivered the message first,)

163
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:12,216
(has the chance to choose from the remaining messages.)

164
00:07:12,355 --> 00:07:16,026
(Take the undelivered messages from the drawer.)

165
00:07:18,995 --> 00:07:21,225
"In the top drawer..."

166
00:07:21,826 --> 00:07:23,795
"with the orange light."

167
00:07:26,295 --> 00:07:29,006
(Two messages left in the drawer)

168
00:07:29,636 --> 00:07:32,536
You need to choose between these two.

169
00:07:34,006 --> 00:07:35,346
I choose the right one.

170
00:07:35,605 --> 00:07:36,776
- The right one? - Yes.

171
00:07:37,175 --> 00:07:40,446
(He chose a message without reading it.)

172
00:07:40,846 --> 00:07:41,946
Here.

173
00:07:42,786 --> 00:07:43,915
What is this?

174
00:07:44,016 --> 00:07:45,016
A message.

175
00:07:45,555 --> 00:07:46,956
I don't know whose it is.

176
00:07:48,826 --> 00:07:51,026
"I think our personalities match."

177
00:07:51,185 --> 00:07:52,456
"Let's have fun on our date."

178
00:07:52,756 --> 00:07:54,956
"I hope you're the one I want to give this note to."

179
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,025
- Whose is that? - It's hers.

180
00:07:57,026 --> 00:07:59,865
- Isn't it her own message? - Oh, my gosh.

181
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:02,165
- No! - No!

182
00:08:02,365 --> 00:08:03,966
Don't choose that.

183
00:08:04,735 --> 00:08:06,975
"I think our personalities match."

184
00:08:07,105 --> 00:08:08,705
"Let's have fun on our date."

185
00:08:08,706 --> 00:08:10,946
(Laughing)

186
00:08:14,276 --> 00:08:16,485
Are you just giving me this? What is this?

187
00:08:17,545 --> 00:08:18,586
Why are you laughing?

188
00:08:20,315 --> 00:08:22,226
This isn't right.

189
00:08:23,455 --> 00:08:24,825
This is from me.

190
00:08:33,736 --> 00:08:34,794
What?

191
00:08:34,795 --> 00:08:36,865
(Se Seung's message was delivered to her sibling.)

192
00:08:36,866 --> 00:08:38,635
No way. Are you serious?

193
00:08:38,636 --> 00:08:40,304
Shouldn't I choose again?

194
00:08:40,305 --> 00:08:41,476
Please.

195
00:08:43,276 --> 00:08:44,545
This is insane.

196
00:08:44,976 --> 00:08:46,415
What is this?

197
00:08:47,175 --> 00:08:48,786
This isn't right.

198
00:08:50,116 --> 00:08:51,415
Do you want...

199
00:08:51,646 --> 00:08:53,885
to watch my sister and I date?

200
00:08:53,886 --> 00:08:55,684
She wouldn't want it either.

201
00:08:55,685 --> 00:08:57,755
I believe it's most ideal for siblings...

202
00:08:57,756 --> 00:09:00,125
to root for...

203
00:09:00,126 --> 00:09:03,365
and pray for each other from afar.

204
00:09:03,366 --> 00:09:05,496
I think that's the best way.

205
00:09:06,435 --> 00:09:08,835
What to do? This is the worst case scenario.

206
00:09:09,205 --> 00:09:11,636
- Is this confirmed? - No.

207
00:09:19,075 --> 00:09:20,815
This is so tough.

208
00:09:22,685 --> 00:09:24,016
I miss my mom.

209
00:09:27,016 --> 00:09:29,486
This is my first date. Must I really do this?

210
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:34,325
Please tell me no.

211
00:09:37,726 --> 00:09:40,865
Gosh.

212
00:09:40,866 --> 00:09:42,006
Thank goodness!

213
00:09:43,506 --> 00:09:44,934
(Read the messages together before choosing.)

214
00:09:44,935 --> 00:09:47,435
They want us to read them together before choosing.

215
00:09:48,006 --> 00:09:50,646
They want us to read both together before choosing.

216
00:09:51,246 --> 00:09:52,476
Which one do you prefer?

217
00:09:52,776 --> 00:09:55,985
"You worked hard on the first day!"

218
00:09:55,986 --> 00:09:58,185
"Let's have fun and get to know each other. "

219
00:09:58,415 --> 00:09:59,986
Wait. Whose message is the other one?

220
00:10:00,116 --> 00:10:01,285
Yun Ha's.

221
00:10:01,286 --> 00:10:02,425
Thank goodness.

222
00:10:02,656 --> 00:10:04,925
I'll go with the atmosphere.

223
00:10:05,656 --> 00:10:07,996
(He puts Se Seung's message back in the drawer.)

224
00:10:08,496 --> 00:10:12,766
(Yun Ha's message for Yong Woo was delivered to Jae Hyung.)

225
00:10:12,996 --> 00:10:14,335
Have fun.

226
00:10:15,766 --> 00:10:17,565
We will be getting to know each other,

227
00:10:17,736 --> 00:10:18,876
not just having fun.

228
00:10:21,305 --> 00:10:23,146
Since we can leave now, let's fight.

229
00:10:25,146 --> 00:10:26,345
You're annoying.

230
00:10:28,646 --> 00:10:30,616
What I found the most annoying...

231
00:10:31,646 --> 00:10:32,856
was when I moved in.

232
00:10:33,856 --> 00:10:35,185
That was so annoying.

233
00:10:36,425 --> 00:10:38,255
(Jae Hyung and Se Seung leave the Siblings' Room.)

234
00:10:38,256 --> 00:10:40,126
We need to start acting now.

235
00:10:50,435 --> 00:10:53,536
(Cho A heads to the Siblings' Room.)

236
00:10:59,876 --> 00:11:02,986
I think I'm still feeling shy around strangers.

237
00:11:03,146 --> 00:11:06,685
So when I got the message that I could meet my sibling,

238
00:11:06,856 --> 00:11:09,585
I could breathe.

239
00:11:30,276 --> 00:11:32,445
(What's the first thing you want to say when you meet your sibling?)

240
00:11:32,575 --> 00:11:33,646
"Are you okay?"

241
00:11:34,776 --> 00:11:36,844
What I worried about at first...

242
00:11:36,845 --> 00:11:41,385
was that we both lived alone for quite some time,

243
00:11:41,386 --> 00:11:45,655
so it's been a long time since we were in a place...

244
00:11:45,656 --> 00:11:46,896
where we got to meet a lot of people.

245
00:11:47,455 --> 00:11:49,865
"Is my sibling okay?"

246
00:11:49,866 --> 00:11:51,626
That was what I thought.

247
00:12:02,205 --> 00:12:07,016
(Who is Cho A's sibling?)

248
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:09,115
- It's Cheol Hyeon. - Exactly.

249
00:12:09,116 --> 00:12:10,786
- Cho A and Cheol Hyeon. - Right?

250
00:12:10,845 --> 00:12:12,085
I think so too.

251
00:12:12,256 --> 00:12:13,555
They look so alike.

252
00:12:13,656 --> 00:12:16,486
I can't wait to find out about their chemistry as siblings.

253
00:12:16,626 --> 00:12:18,755
I think they're very close too.

254
00:12:18,756 --> 00:12:19,895
For me,

255
00:12:19,896 --> 00:12:21,795
- Cho A is like a closed book. - That's right.

256
00:12:37,805 --> 00:12:40,544
(Cho A's sibling...)

257
00:12:40,545 --> 00:12:41,646
Hello.

258
00:12:43,445 --> 00:12:44,516
Hello.

259
00:12:46,286 --> 00:12:48,156
Are you okay here?

260
00:12:48,486 --> 00:12:49,825
A bit.

261
00:12:49,925 --> 00:12:51,824
He asked me the same thing.

262
00:12:51,825 --> 00:12:54,455
"Are you okay?" He asked me that.

263
00:12:55,766 --> 00:12:57,625
The first thing I wanted to ask...

264
00:12:57,626 --> 00:13:00,435
was whether she was okay or not.

265
00:13:00,565 --> 00:13:02,434
Whether she's adjusting well.

266
00:13:02,435 --> 00:13:05,575
"In the environment where we need to stay with others,"

267
00:13:06,006 --> 00:13:07,406
"will she be all right?"

268
00:13:07,476 --> 00:13:09,476
That was what I thought.

269
00:13:10,646 --> 00:13:12,276
I'm so worried about you.

270
00:13:12,415 --> 00:13:15,016
I'm still having fun.

271
00:13:15,786 --> 00:13:19,016
When you moved in first,

272
00:13:19,286 --> 00:13:21,785
- you were adjusting so well. - Yes.

273
00:13:21,786 --> 00:13:23,786
I shouldn't have worried about you.

274
00:13:27,626 --> 00:13:29,865
How are you feeling now?

275
00:13:29,866 --> 00:13:31,366
That's what I am most worried about.

276
00:13:31,695 --> 00:13:33,195
I'm fine. And...

277
00:13:33,595 --> 00:13:35,866
I was quite worried at first,

278
00:13:36,236 --> 00:13:38,605
- but I think it's fun. - Are you having fun?

279
00:13:38,606 --> 00:13:41,405
Yes. Chatting with others and so on.

280
00:13:41,406 --> 00:13:43,745
I think I needed some time...

281
00:13:43,746 --> 00:13:46,115
- like this. - That's right. For us...

282
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:47,975
It feels strange, doesn't it?

283
00:13:47,976 --> 00:13:50,544
Exactly. It makes me think, "When was the last time..."

284
00:13:50,545 --> 00:13:54,286
"that everyone ate together on a dining table..."

285
00:13:54,756 --> 00:13:57,126
- "at home like this?" - You're right.

286
00:14:03,766 --> 00:14:06,996
Did you tell your father about today's meeting?

287
00:14:10,136 --> 00:14:12,136
Our family relationship is...

288
00:14:12,705 --> 00:14:16,646
I can talk openly about it, right?

289
00:14:16,805 --> 00:14:19,875
So, well...

290
00:14:19,876 --> 00:14:22,915
Now, both my sister and I...

291
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:26,314
have grown up, and in a way, I feel...

292
00:14:26,315 --> 00:14:29,156
that we grew up nice and strong.

293
00:14:29,256 --> 00:14:32,896
But before, I was too embarrassed to talk about this and I hated it.

294
00:14:33,156 --> 00:14:36,565
I often thought, "Why did this happen?"

295
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:39,795
For my family, Mother passed away from cancer...

296
00:14:39,896 --> 00:14:41,595
when I was 20.

297
00:14:42,866 --> 00:14:45,635
We had some family conflicts since we were young.

298
00:14:45,636 --> 00:14:49,075
Both Cho A and I felt very anxious.

299
00:14:49,406 --> 00:14:52,005
It has been that way since we were young.

300
00:14:52,006 --> 00:14:56,315
I think Father was quite awkward with expressing his love.

301
00:14:56,386 --> 00:14:57,516
He was very crude.

302
00:14:57,715 --> 00:15:01,414
I think that was how I got closer with my sister.

303
00:15:01,415 --> 00:15:03,155
Even when we fought, I would keep thinking about her.

304
00:15:03,156 --> 00:15:06,525
After Mother passed away and we had her funeral,

305
00:15:06,526 --> 00:15:08,595
I told her that we should go to Seoul.

306
00:15:11,965 --> 00:15:14,136
How long did she suffer from her illness?

307
00:15:14,295 --> 00:15:15,704
For quite long.

308
00:15:15,705 --> 00:15:18,006
It started when I was in middle school...

309
00:15:18,266 --> 00:15:20,574
and lasted until I graduated from the university.

310
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:24,005
She suffered for quite long. It relapsed too.

311
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,006
(For more than 7 years, Cho A was by her mother's side.)

312
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,616
It must have been really hard for you on your own.

313
00:15:28,045 --> 00:15:29,246
It was hard.

314
00:15:30,445 --> 00:15:32,145
You must've spent most of your time with your mother.

315
00:15:32,146 --> 00:15:33,356
That's right.

316
00:15:33,715 --> 00:15:35,286
For seven years?

317
00:15:36,825 --> 00:15:39,555
Yes, it must have been hard for her.

318
00:15:40,496 --> 00:15:41,794
What I remember is,

319
00:15:41,795 --> 00:15:45,595
when I was in university, I went out on a date on Christmas.

320
00:15:45,965 --> 00:15:48,265
I wanted to go on a date,

321
00:15:48,266 --> 00:15:50,006
but Mom was alone at home.

322
00:15:50,536 --> 00:15:54,106
My instinctive desire was to go out and have fun...

323
00:15:54,175 --> 00:15:56,746
like others of my age,

324
00:15:57,006 --> 00:15:59,444
but I felt like I had to fulfill my responsibility.

325
00:15:59,445 --> 00:16:01,844
It always felt like I committed a sin...

326
00:16:01,845 --> 00:16:02,915
whenever I went out to have fun.

327
00:16:07,886 --> 00:16:10,085
How old were you when you took these photos?

328
00:16:10,226 --> 00:16:12,794
It hasn't been long since she fell ill.

329
00:16:12,795 --> 00:16:15,825
I think I was in my third year of middle school or high school.

330
00:16:18,626 --> 00:16:21,535
(Cho A when she was 20)

331
00:16:21,536 --> 00:16:24,305
Did you initially want to go to a university in Seoul?

332
00:16:24,506 --> 00:16:25,564
Yes.

333
00:16:25,565 --> 00:16:28,334
I went to Seoul for a school assignment,

334
00:16:28,335 --> 00:16:30,204
and I fell in love with Seoul.

335
00:16:30,205 --> 00:16:32,005
I thought,

336
00:16:32,006 --> 00:16:34,414
"You can enjoy the culture and art so much."

337
00:16:34,415 --> 00:16:37,615
"It's amazing. I must come here."

338
00:16:37,616 --> 00:16:40,184
I want to achieve my dream,

339
00:16:40,185 --> 00:16:42,315
but I couldn't leave Mom behind.

340
00:16:44,756 --> 00:16:46,225
(University of Ulsan fresher)

341
00:16:46,226 --> 00:16:49,324
(Is that why you went to a university near you?)

342
00:16:49,325 --> 00:16:52,196
That's right. I couldn't go anywhere far away.

343
00:16:52,436 --> 00:16:54,364
Even when I was studying in university,

344
00:16:54,365 --> 00:16:56,535
I wanted to leave my house quickly,

345
00:16:56,536 --> 00:16:59,875
so I searched for a lot of ways.

346
00:17:00,276 --> 00:17:02,745
Although I knew...

347
00:17:02,746 --> 00:17:05,605
I practically couldn't do anything,

348
00:17:05,676 --> 00:17:08,015
I always had that dream.

349
00:17:08,016 --> 00:17:10,186
That was why I applied for the student exchange program.

350
00:17:10,545 --> 00:17:12,516
Thankfully, I got in,

351
00:17:12,756 --> 00:17:14,015
but I couldn't go...

352
00:17:14,016 --> 00:17:17,726
in case something went wrong while I was away.

353
00:17:19,256 --> 00:17:23,895
- Because of her mom. - She must've given up on a lot.

354
00:17:25,526 --> 00:17:27,564
She looked after her mother on her own for seven years.

355
00:17:27,565 --> 00:17:28,666
She's amazing.

356
00:17:29,736 --> 00:17:33,104
I stayed by her side until she passed away...

357
00:17:33,105 --> 00:17:34,574
and came to Seoul after graduating.

358
00:17:34,575 --> 00:17:36,775
Will you choose the same thing...

359
00:17:36,776 --> 00:17:38,276
if you go back...

360
00:17:38,746 --> 00:17:39,776
to the past?

361
00:17:40,016 --> 00:17:41,115
Yes.

362
00:17:41,946 --> 00:17:43,216
I have no regrets.

363
00:17:46,385 --> 00:17:49,486
That's how it is. If I do my best in whatever things that I do,

364
00:17:49,726 --> 00:17:51,686
I don't look back.

365
00:17:52,026 --> 00:17:55,394
But if I hadn't done that back then...

366
00:17:55,395 --> 00:17:59,365
and only thought about my happiness and well-being,

367
00:17:59,936 --> 00:18:03,265
I would've regretted a lot...

368
00:18:03,266 --> 00:18:05,305
about not doing so for a long time.

369
00:18:05,976 --> 00:18:09,506
One day, it was towards the end of her days.

370
00:18:09,805 --> 00:18:12,645
She kept going back and forth due to morphine and so on.

371
00:18:13,115 --> 00:18:15,044
She kept changing her words...

372
00:18:15,045 --> 00:18:16,545
and babbled.

373
00:18:16,686 --> 00:18:18,385
Mom wanted to eat jjajangmyeon.

374
00:18:19,085 --> 00:18:22,525
"Cheol Hyeon, count the number of people in the room..."

375
00:18:22,526 --> 00:18:25,025
"and ask if they would like to eat."

376
00:18:25,026 --> 00:18:26,955
"Okay."

377
00:18:26,956 --> 00:18:28,625
Some said yes, some said no.

378
00:18:28,696 --> 00:18:31,894
So I ordered according to that.

379
00:18:31,895 --> 00:18:34,436
Jjajangmyeon and jjamppong were delivered,

380
00:18:36,036 --> 00:18:38,666
and Mom asked why I didn't order according to the number of people.

381
00:18:39,905 --> 00:18:42,036
She was extremely angry at me...

382
00:18:46,045 --> 00:18:47,715
as she said that.

383
00:18:47,716 --> 00:18:49,246
I felt very upset.

384
00:18:49,686 --> 00:18:54,154
She was nearing her end, so I should've held it in.

385
00:18:54,155 --> 00:18:57,855
But I thought, "Why is she scolding me in front of so many people?"

386
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:03,125
And I exploded.

387
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:05,995
I just ran out.

388
00:19:05,996 --> 00:19:08,134
There was a place where you could use the computer...

389
00:19:08,135 --> 00:19:10,134
if you put in 50 cents.

390
00:19:10,135 --> 00:19:12,266
I was playing the computer,

391
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:14,335
and Mom texted me.

392
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:17,904
"Cheol Hyeon, I'm sorry."

393
00:19:17,905 --> 00:19:21,345
"Because of the medicine, I'm going back and forth."

394
00:19:29,216 --> 00:19:31,426
That's what I'm most sorry about to her.

395
00:19:39,966 --> 00:19:41,995
It was a few days after we moved to Seoul.

396
00:19:41,996 --> 00:19:45,065
He suddenly came to my house crying.

397
00:19:45,506 --> 00:19:47,675
"Cho A, I can't look up at the sky."

398
00:19:47,676 --> 00:19:52,446
"It feels like Mom is resenting me from the sky."

399
00:19:54,075 --> 00:19:55,344
He said that on that day,

400
00:19:55,345 --> 00:19:58,286
so I thought that he felt guilty about Mom too.

401
00:19:59,555 --> 00:20:02,385
That was what I thought.

402
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:05,655
(How did you move to Seoul?)

403
00:20:06,295 --> 00:20:09,425
I thought that I had to protect myself.

404
00:20:09,426 --> 00:20:11,995
When I was young, I didn't know and I was weak.

405
00:20:11,996 --> 00:20:15,665
And I had to protect Mom,

406
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:18,505
so I had no choice but to endure it.

407
00:20:18,506 --> 00:20:21,235
But after I got older,

408
00:20:21,236 --> 00:20:23,545
I was actually very confused.

409
00:20:23,706 --> 00:20:27,775
What I knew for sure was that I had to leave to survive.

410
00:20:27,776 --> 00:20:30,786
I knew it in my head, but I couldn't do it.

411
00:20:31,216 --> 00:20:33,885
As I was in that state, Cheol Hyeon said,

412
00:20:34,155 --> 00:20:36,785
"Let's pack up and leave."

413
00:20:36,786 --> 00:20:39,895
He led me decisively.

414
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:42,995
I tend to worry a lot and have a lot of fears...

415
00:20:42,996 --> 00:20:46,236
before I start something,

416
00:20:46,436 --> 00:20:49,705
but Cheol Hyeon leads me and helps me out...

417
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:52,905
in things that I am hesitant about.

418
00:20:54,536 --> 00:20:57,975
(In 2011, Cho A and Cheol Hyeon right after they moved to Seoul)

419
00:20:57,976 --> 00:21:00,114
We really moved up without anything.

420
00:21:00,115 --> 00:21:01,615
Did we only have 5,000 dollars?

421
00:21:02,216 --> 00:21:05,545
We started out from a studio apartment.

422
00:21:06,756 --> 00:21:09,314
It felt like we just came to Seoul on a trip...

423
00:21:09,315 --> 00:21:12,426
while Mom was in Ulsan.

424
00:21:12,996 --> 00:21:16,864
That's how I controlled my mind too.

425
00:21:16,865 --> 00:21:19,025
I didn't accept her absence at the start.

426
00:21:19,026 --> 00:21:21,795
It went on for a while. For about 3 to 4 years.

427
00:21:22,065 --> 00:21:25,604
I kept controlling my mind, but then I lost my calm...

428
00:21:25,605 --> 00:21:27,505
while working.

429
00:21:27,506 --> 00:21:30,945
It was when women of my mom's age came in.

430
00:21:30,946 --> 00:21:33,176
That's when it hit me.

431
00:21:34,776 --> 00:21:37,186
We only had each other as family.

432
00:21:37,815 --> 00:21:39,246
"Since we don't have anyone else,"

433
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:42,314
"let's rely on each other and live well."

434
00:21:42,315 --> 00:21:43,885
That's what I think the most.

435
00:21:45,286 --> 00:21:49,095
(Who is your family?)

436
00:21:49,426 --> 00:21:50,824
That would be my sister.

437
00:21:50,825 --> 00:21:53,196
The person I think of as "family" is my sister.

438
00:21:53,365 --> 00:21:54,365
My sister.

439
00:21:59,575 --> 00:22:00,875
I still visit her grave to this day.

440
00:22:01,206 --> 00:22:02,535
When it's an anniversary of her death,

441
00:22:02,536 --> 00:22:04,304
we leave her favorite food there,

442
00:22:04,305 --> 00:22:06,245
and I say, "Cho A, let us two eat something good."

443
00:22:06,246 --> 00:22:09,585
"We should eat good food so Mom is happy too."

444
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:13,055
We set some food there and bow to her grave.

445
00:22:13,716 --> 00:22:16,325
Then I spend time with her.

446
00:22:22,095 --> 00:22:24,226
It's nice, though. This is my sister.

447
00:22:27,135 --> 00:22:28,795
As time goes by, we look more and more alike.

448
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:30,766
People say that.

449
00:22:34,605 --> 00:22:36,276
When I'm with Cheol Hyeon,

450
00:22:37,206 --> 00:22:38,246
I feel comfortable.

451
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:41,845
I feel like I'm with someone who has my back,

452
00:22:42,216 --> 00:22:45,016
so I feel relaxed around him.

453
00:22:45,286 --> 00:22:47,815
I think my sister is the person I feel most comfortable around.

454
00:22:48,016 --> 00:22:49,286
I can tell her everything.

455
00:22:49,555 --> 00:22:52,256
She feels that way too, so it's more comfortable.

456
00:23:04,006 --> 00:23:06,005
I feel a sense of stability...

457
00:23:06,006 --> 00:23:09,706
in being in the same space or sharing the same air with him.

458
00:23:10,776 --> 00:23:12,845
I hope I'm a reliable brother to her.

459
00:23:13,446 --> 00:23:14,776
I hope...

460
00:23:15,016 --> 00:23:18,815
she feels protected because of my presence.

461
00:23:19,686 --> 00:23:21,256
I hope he feels secure,

462
00:23:21,516 --> 00:23:24,426
thinking there's someone who always trusts him...

463
00:23:24,786 --> 00:23:27,395
whenever he goes.

464
00:23:35,996 --> 00:23:37,735
"We don't have a family photo,"

465
00:23:37,736 --> 00:23:40,634
"so let's make memories by doing like this."

466
00:23:40,635 --> 00:23:42,006
That's why we took the video.

467
00:23:53,355 --> 00:23:56,256
To me, she's my only family.

468
00:23:56,426 --> 00:23:57,426
So...

469
00:23:57,825 --> 00:24:00,625
I'm really grateful that I have her.

470
00:24:01,055 --> 00:24:03,095
What would I do if I didn't have her?

471
00:24:05,726 --> 00:24:08,635
I really love her because she's my only family.

472
00:24:19,075 --> 00:24:20,675
(Two months before moving in)

473
00:24:20,676 --> 00:24:22,344
- Hello. - How have you been?

474
00:24:22,345 --> 00:24:23,585
- Hello. - Hello.

475
00:24:24,016 --> 00:24:26,716
We didn't know anything about your family's story.

476
00:24:26,916 --> 00:24:28,355
We found out while interviewing you back then.

477
00:24:28,655 --> 00:24:32,185
In fact, while planning this show,

478
00:24:32,186 --> 00:24:34,624
there were some structures that we had in mind.

479
00:24:34,625 --> 00:24:38,026
We were going to get the participants' families involved.

480
00:24:38,196 --> 00:24:39,564
The fathers...

481
00:24:39,565 --> 00:24:41,235
- Or the parents. - or the parents. Right.

482
00:24:41,236 --> 00:24:44,135
There are some parts we plan to involve the parents.

483
00:24:44,506 --> 00:24:46,006
There will be a phone in the house.

484
00:24:46,676 --> 00:24:48,776
And the parents will call you.

485
00:24:49,605 --> 00:24:51,074
But Cheol Hyeon and Cho A,

486
00:24:51,075 --> 00:24:53,115
you two might get flustered in that situation.

487
00:24:53,516 --> 00:24:55,446
These moments might be uncomfortable for you too.

488
00:24:55,875 --> 00:24:58,246
We kept thinking about what to do...

489
00:24:58,385 --> 00:25:01,516
and decided to ask you if you'd be okay with this.

490
00:25:02,315 --> 00:25:03,584
No matter how much we want to do this,

491
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:06,185
we can do this with your approval only.

492
00:25:06,186 --> 00:25:07,225
Right.

493
00:25:07,226 --> 00:25:10,166
- Oh, dear. - Goodness.

494
00:25:10,466 --> 00:25:12,196
The crew let them know in advance.

495
00:25:13,496 --> 00:25:14,536
I see.

496
00:25:16,335 --> 00:25:18,166
I don't feel ashamed...

497
00:25:18,905 --> 00:25:20,605
of saying it myself.

498
00:25:21,105 --> 00:25:23,946
We had a hard time, but we grew up well.

499
00:25:24,145 --> 00:25:26,045
In a way, I want people to see that.

500
00:25:26,345 --> 00:25:28,745
I think it could be liberating.

501
00:25:28,746 --> 00:25:30,885
"We're staying strong and living well."

502
00:25:34,016 --> 00:25:36,554
(Why do you think Cheol Hyeon decide to be on the show?)

503
00:25:36,555 --> 00:25:37,625
Cheol Hyeon?

504
00:25:38,186 --> 00:25:40,456
He told me that he wanted to be understood.

505
00:25:41,055 --> 00:25:42,996
"I'm really grateful..."

506
00:25:43,526 --> 00:25:47,634
"that we got a chance to talk about our situation."

507
00:25:47,635 --> 00:25:49,565
That's what he told me.

508
00:25:50,065 --> 00:25:53,334
And I said, "Yes, you're right,"

509
00:25:53,335 --> 00:25:54,804
"but here's what I think."

510
00:25:54,805 --> 00:25:59,445
"Is it possible for me to be understood by someone?"

511
00:25:59,446 --> 00:26:00,716
"I wonder."

512
00:26:01,075 --> 00:26:04,416
"If I hope to be understood, I might suffer..."

513
00:26:04,516 --> 00:26:08,314
"if there's a different reaction. That's why I'm hesitant."

514
00:26:08,315 --> 00:26:11,256
I told him my honest thoughts.

515
00:26:13,595 --> 00:26:14,894
Despite that,

516
00:26:14,895 --> 00:26:16,794
- Yes. - why did you decide to participate?

517
00:26:16,795 --> 00:26:20,036
(What made you participate despite the thought?)

518
00:26:20,766 --> 00:26:24,166
I made my decision to participate...

519
00:26:25,865 --> 00:26:28,405
because I decided to accept all sides of me.

520
00:26:29,276 --> 00:26:31,776
That's why I could make this decision.

521
00:26:33,645 --> 00:26:35,675
- It took her a lot of courage. - Yes.

522
00:26:35,676 --> 00:26:37,246
I know.

523
00:26:38,845 --> 00:26:41,686
(On the first day of moving in)

524
00:26:41,956 --> 00:26:43,185
Our food is here.

525
00:26:43,186 --> 00:26:46,255
(When side dishes from the parents arrived)

526
00:26:46,256 --> 00:26:47,425
“Prepare dinner..."

527
00:26:47,426 --> 00:26:48,825
- "and eat together." - "And eat together."

528
00:26:49,325 --> 00:26:51,365
Before moving in,

529
00:26:51,825 --> 00:26:54,995
the crew tipped us...

530
00:26:54,996 --> 00:26:57,605
about the parents packing side dishes for the participants.

531
00:26:58,365 --> 00:27:01,936
I thought I'd feel weird.

532
00:27:02,236 --> 00:27:03,845
I thought of my sibling first.

533
00:27:06,446 --> 00:27:07,516
Would he be okay?

534
00:27:09,986 --> 00:27:13,655
Because he must feel the same way as I would at the moment.

535
00:27:15,155 --> 00:27:17,085
Honestly, my first impression was...

536
00:27:18,155 --> 00:27:19,186
"Right. Family."

537
00:27:20,426 --> 00:27:23,625
That really hit me hard.

538
00:27:23,996 --> 00:27:26,536
In a way, I felt like I became a lot calmer than before...

539
00:27:27,635 --> 00:27:28,696
about it.

540
00:27:28,895 --> 00:27:29,905
But...

541
00:27:31,036 --> 00:27:33,236
- I think they gave us Korean food. - I know. I love it.

542
00:27:33,506 --> 00:27:35,006
The seaweed soup looks so good.

543
00:27:35,635 --> 00:27:37,304
- Wait. - This is braised kimchi.

544
00:27:37,305 --> 00:27:38,305
This is...

545
00:27:38,306 --> 00:27:39,604
Shall we eat this tomorrow?

546
00:27:39,605 --> 00:27:40,875
Isn't it better to finish it quickly?

547
00:27:42,345 --> 00:27:43,945
- Thank you for the meal. - Thanks for the meal.

548
00:27:43,946 --> 00:27:45,285
Enjoy.

549
00:27:45,286 --> 00:27:46,415
The perilla leaves are good.

550
00:27:46,416 --> 00:27:47,855
- Everything is delicious. - It is.

551
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:49,686
I miss my mom.

552
00:27:50,286 --> 00:27:51,456
It's delicious.

553
00:27:56,726 --> 00:28:00,236
Do you often eat like this with your family?

554
00:28:00,436 --> 00:28:01,536
Sometimes, I do.

555
00:28:01,865 --> 00:28:02,966
Do you usually eat alone?

556
00:28:03,635 --> 00:28:06,475
Most of the time, I eat alone.

557
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:07,536
I see.

558
00:28:07,805 --> 00:28:09,705
How do you feel now?

559
00:28:09,706 --> 00:28:10,945
- I'm so happy. - You are?

560
00:28:10,946 --> 00:28:12,005
- I love it. - It feels harmonious.

561
00:28:12,006 --> 00:28:13,145
Yes, it's harmonious.

562
00:28:14,345 --> 00:28:15,476
While eating,

563
00:28:15,716 --> 00:28:19,716
I kept thinking about the word "family" in my head.

564
00:28:20,155 --> 00:28:24,786
Then Se Seung's parents called in the middle of the dinner.

565
00:28:25,226 --> 00:28:26,925
Dad, where are you?

566
00:28:26,926 --> 00:28:28,095
Are you nearby?

567
00:28:28,325 --> 00:28:30,295
Okay. Bye. I love you.

568
00:28:32,226 --> 00:28:34,966
- They seem close. - They do.

569
00:28:48,315 --> 00:28:50,516
She was so sweet to her family.

570
00:28:51,016 --> 00:28:52,986
"How can they talk for so long..."

571
00:28:53,786 --> 00:28:55,315
"like friends?"

572
00:28:55,486 --> 00:28:56,926
I was jealous.

573
00:28:57,526 --> 00:28:58,956
I thought, "That would be so nice."

574
00:28:59,355 --> 00:29:01,394
It was the kind of family environment...

575
00:29:01,395 --> 00:29:03,425
that I dreamed of when I was little.

576
00:29:03,426 --> 00:29:05,625
Delightful parents who are like friends.

577
00:29:07,166 --> 00:29:08,765
- Were they worried? - They were worried...

578
00:29:08,766 --> 00:29:10,905
that I would be cold.

579
00:29:12,006 --> 00:29:14,135
It's so nice to see it.

580
00:29:17,045 --> 00:29:19,105
I like it, though.

581
00:29:19,676 --> 00:29:22,815
Seeing families like that gives me vicarious satisfaction.

582
00:29:23,115 --> 00:29:26,315
I felt warm rather than sad.

583
00:29:39,466 --> 00:29:40,834
How do you think I'm doing?

584
00:29:40,835 --> 00:29:42,394
Don't you think I'm too excited?

585
00:29:42,395 --> 00:29:43,465
- I feel like... - Yes.

586
00:29:43,466 --> 00:29:45,305
- I feel like you overreacted a bit. - Yes.

587
00:29:45,605 --> 00:29:48,135
- Well... - I feel like you do,

588
00:29:48,276 --> 00:29:50,544
but I also think you're letting your guard down...

589
00:29:50,545 --> 00:29:52,245
and are actually being yourself.

590
00:29:52,246 --> 00:29:54,776
- Right. - You're just being yourself.

591
00:29:54,946 --> 00:29:57,814
You started to suppress your emotions in some situations...

592
00:29:57,815 --> 00:29:59,415
- at some point. - Right.

593
00:29:59,416 --> 00:30:00,755
But today...

594
00:30:00,756 --> 00:30:03,055
it was like when we hung out with our cousins.

595
00:30:03,155 --> 00:30:06,996
You were so playful like you used to be before.

596
00:30:07,855 --> 00:30:09,455
- I feel comfortable like this. - Right.

597
00:30:09,456 --> 00:30:10,995
- I feel at ease. - You looked relaxed.

598
00:30:10,996 --> 00:30:14,496
It was nice seeing you like that.

599
00:30:14,966 --> 00:30:16,605
I think I know why.

600
00:30:16,736 --> 00:30:18,804
I think I feel more comfortable...

601
00:30:18,805 --> 00:30:21,335
because I'm with you.

602
00:30:21,436 --> 00:30:23,006
- There's one thing. - Okay.

603
00:30:23,206 --> 00:30:25,205
If I get close to them quickly,

604
00:30:25,206 --> 00:30:27,176
you can talk comfortably with them too.

605
00:30:27,416 --> 00:30:28,645
That's what I thought.

606
00:30:29,315 --> 00:30:31,786
By the way, I feel like I'm coming off...

607
00:30:32,016 --> 00:30:33,355
as too clumsy.

608
00:30:34,016 --> 00:30:36,515
Your hair looks a little weird today too.

609
00:30:36,516 --> 00:30:38,785
- Why does it look like this? - It's a little oily, right?

610
00:30:38,786 --> 00:30:40,026
- No. - That's why I'm...

611
00:30:40,595 --> 00:30:43,564
- You look like Hong Gil Dong. - I know.

612
00:30:43,565 --> 00:30:45,695
I couldn't get used to my hair,

613
00:30:45,696 --> 00:30:48,095
but everyone said I looked good,

614
00:30:48,536 --> 00:30:49,635
so I assumed I did.

615
00:30:50,236 --> 00:30:52,465
(A few hours ago)

616
00:30:52,466 --> 00:30:54,975
- Hello. - Hello.

617
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:56,006
Nice to meet you.

618
00:30:56,305 --> 00:30:58,946
(His hair looks flat in the back.)

619
00:31:00,145 --> 00:31:01,976
- I thought, - I didn't think I looked good.

620
00:31:02,916 --> 00:31:05,515
"Some stupid-looking guy came in."

621
00:31:05,516 --> 00:31:08,016
I wondered if you were the only person who got wet in the rain.

622
00:31:08,916 --> 00:31:11,624
No. He's being loved by someone now.

623
00:31:11,625 --> 00:31:13,525
- Right. - It's okay if it's greasier.

624
00:31:13,526 --> 00:31:14,695
His hair is cool.

625
00:31:14,696 --> 00:31:16,054
If I had that face,

626
00:31:16,055 --> 00:31:17,325
I'd live with my hair greasy.

627
00:31:18,565 --> 00:31:19,696
For the rest of my life.

628
00:31:20,266 --> 00:31:22,065
- You won't wash your hair again? - Of course not.

629
00:31:24,006 --> 00:31:26,875
I barely made eye contact with you.

630
00:31:27,436 --> 00:31:31,075
Since I felt comfortable with you, I couldn't help...

631
00:31:31,506 --> 00:31:33,375
- You started to talk casually. - I know.

632
00:31:34,246 --> 00:31:35,416
I thought...

633
00:31:35,676 --> 00:31:37,844
I'd call you sister as soon as I walked in.

634
00:31:37,845 --> 00:31:39,246
I thought I'd say it without realizing it.

635
00:31:39,585 --> 00:31:41,685
But I found myself doing better than I thought.

636
00:31:41,686 --> 00:31:43,456
- I only called you Cho A. - Right.

637
00:31:44,286 --> 00:31:45,286
It's so cold.

638
00:31:45,287 --> 00:31:46,995
(The crew tests Cheol Hyeon before he goes in.)

639
00:31:46,996 --> 00:31:48,196
What is your name?

640
00:31:48,756 --> 00:31:49,794
Cheol Hyeon.

641
00:31:49,795 --> 00:31:52,226
- What is your last name? - I will keep it a secret.

642
00:31:52,726 --> 00:31:53,895
Where is your hometown?

643
00:31:54,266 --> 00:31:55,665
(Silent)

644
00:31:55,666 --> 00:31:56,766
Can I say it?

645
00:31:59,666 --> 00:32:01,874
- They tested them all. - They were meticulous.

646
00:32:01,875 --> 00:32:03,104
They trained him before letting him go in.

647
00:32:03,105 --> 00:32:04,105
I know.

648
00:32:04,345 --> 00:32:05,345
Training his mind.

649
00:32:06,006 --> 00:32:08,375
Cheol Hyeon and Cho A.

650
00:32:12,746 --> 00:32:15,455
Cheol Hyeon.

651
00:32:15,456 --> 00:32:17,426
I'm afraid I might address him informally.

652
00:32:21,095 --> 00:32:22,225
(The brother and sister moved in after intensive training.)

653
00:32:22,226 --> 00:32:23,226
Hello.

654
00:32:24,726 --> 00:32:25,865
I don't know.

655
00:32:26,865 --> 00:32:28,765
I think we did a good job hiding it.

656
00:32:28,766 --> 00:32:29,766
Yes.

657
00:32:29,767 --> 00:32:31,305
- Is it because I was aware of it? - Okay.

658
00:32:31,436 --> 00:32:33,475
I thought you were taking care of me too well.

659
00:32:33,476 --> 00:32:34,574
- Is that so? - Yes.

660
00:32:34,575 --> 00:32:36,535
I just remember this one line...

661
00:32:36,536 --> 00:32:37,545
- vividly. - Okay.

662
00:32:37,875 --> 00:32:39,574
"Cho A, you should work tomorrow."

663
00:32:39,575 --> 00:32:40,675
"Aren't you tired?"

664
00:32:40,676 --> 00:32:41,915
"Isn't it what anyone would say?"

665
00:32:41,916 --> 00:32:43,246
That's what I thought.

666
00:32:43,815 --> 00:32:46,516
(While everyone is eating silently)

667
00:32:47,055 --> 00:32:48,256
(Glancing over)

668
00:32:49,716 --> 00:32:51,256
You'll be carried away. Don't do it.

669
00:32:53,286 --> 00:32:55,696
Will any of us work tomorrow?

670
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,266
Will anyone work tomorrow?

671
00:32:59,825 --> 00:33:01,265
- Tomorrow... - Do you work tomorrow?

672
00:33:01,266 --> 00:33:02,294
Yes.

673
00:33:02,295 --> 00:33:03,295
(Answering informally)

674
00:33:05,006 --> 00:33:08,936
Cho A, you must be tired because you came early today.

675
00:33:11,375 --> 00:33:13,176
What is that?

676
00:33:13,446 --> 00:33:15,075
Now that I know their siblings, it's hard to watch.

677
00:33:16,615 --> 00:33:20,615
Cho A, you must be tired because you came early today.

678
00:33:20,786 --> 00:33:21,885
You should...

679
00:33:22,716 --> 00:33:23,755
rest later...

680
00:33:23,756 --> 00:33:25,026
just as all of us should.

681
00:33:31,166 --> 00:33:33,996
There's something about me.

682
00:33:34,895 --> 00:33:37,006
Let's do our best not to get caught.

683
00:33:37,706 --> 00:33:39,305
Was there anyone you liked?

684
00:33:40,335 --> 00:33:44,105
As soon as I came in,

685
00:33:44,405 --> 00:33:45,575
someone caught my attention.

686
00:33:46,206 --> 00:33:47,814
There was someone...

687
00:33:47,815 --> 00:33:49,415
I thought I wanted to go on a date with.

688
00:33:49,416 --> 00:33:50,446
I see.

689
00:33:52,946 --> 00:33:55,314
Can I say his name first?

690
00:33:55,315 --> 00:33:56,356
Okay.

691
00:33:58,055 --> 00:33:59,655
- Yong Woo? - No.

692
00:33:59,885 --> 00:34:00,996
- No? - No.

693
00:34:01,226 --> 00:34:03,425
- Really? - You thought I'd be into him?

694
00:34:03,796 --> 00:34:08,995
I felt like Yong Woo would hit it off with you.

695
00:34:08,996 --> 00:34:10,936
That was my impression.

696
00:34:12,005 --> 00:34:14,405
I guess I was wrong.

697
00:34:15,336 --> 00:34:18,245
Once I walked in, he just caught my eye.

698
00:34:18,246 --> 00:34:19,674
He seemed like a serious person.

699
00:34:19,675 --> 00:34:22,246
I thought I wanted to talk more with him.

700
00:34:22,345 --> 00:34:23,786
- Jung Sub? - Yes.

701
00:34:24,546 --> 00:34:27,555
I thought if we talked, we would just get each other.

702
00:34:27,715 --> 00:34:29,214
That's how it felt.

703
00:34:29,215 --> 00:34:30,825
- And... - Yes.

704
00:34:31,025 --> 00:34:33,824
I personally thought he seemed delicate.

705
00:34:33,825 --> 00:34:34,856
- I see. - Yes.

706
00:34:35,296 --> 00:34:36,495
(I see.)

707
00:34:36,496 --> 00:34:38,465
I'm really surprised.

708
00:34:39,066 --> 00:34:40,266
Because it's unexpected?

709
00:34:44,305 --> 00:34:46,904
Even before moving in,

710
00:34:46,905 --> 00:34:50,106
I had a fantasy about my brother-in-law.

711
00:34:50,246 --> 00:34:52,845
It's part of my "find my brother-in-law" mission.

712
00:34:53,005 --> 00:34:54,445
It's important how he clicks with my sister,

713
00:34:54,575 --> 00:34:57,815
but I've also been looking...

714
00:34:57,816 --> 00:34:59,146
for who could fulfill my fantasy.

715
00:34:59,845 --> 00:35:01,054
"Find my brother-in-law" mission?

716
00:35:01,055 --> 00:35:02,586
- A brother-in-law fantasy? - A brother-in-law fantasy?

717
00:35:03,316 --> 00:35:04,884
- His brother-in-law. - I've never heard of a fantasy...

718
00:35:04,885 --> 00:35:06,126
about one's brother-in-law.

719
00:35:06,286 --> 00:35:07,355
He has his dream brother-in-law.

720
00:35:07,356 --> 00:35:09,024
That's something to look forward to in the show.

721
00:35:09,025 --> 00:35:10,154
My goodness.

722
00:35:10,155 --> 00:35:12,965
I have a fantasy about my sister getting married.

723
00:35:13,195 --> 00:35:15,465
Doing things with the person...

724
00:35:15,836 --> 00:35:18,065
who my sister has gotten married to.

725
00:35:18,066 --> 00:35:19,234
It should be so much fun.

726
00:35:19,235 --> 00:35:21,575
It warms my heart when I think about it.

727
00:35:21,905 --> 00:35:24,146
I think I want my brother-in-law to take care of me.

728
00:35:24,345 --> 00:35:25,475
I'll do my best.

729
00:35:25,476 --> 00:35:26,775
(He moved in on a mission to find a brother-in-law.)

730
00:35:27,615 --> 00:35:29,146
Based on my first impressions, I liked Yong Woo.

731
00:35:29,345 --> 00:35:30,545
He is cheerful and sociable...

732
00:35:30,546 --> 00:35:32,715
and lifts everyone's energy.

733
00:35:33,316 --> 00:35:36,356
(Cheol Hyeon chose Yong Woo.)

734
00:35:37,126 --> 00:35:39,456
(Yong Woo was resting alone.)

735
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:42,456
(Then a black coat approaches him.)

736
00:35:43,095 --> 00:35:44,195
I like the song.

737
00:35:45,425 --> 00:35:46,465
(Glancing)

738
00:35:48,195 --> 00:35:50,734
I'm dreaming of eating a meal with my brother-in-law...

739
00:35:50,735 --> 00:35:53,266
while having a drink.

740
00:35:53,635 --> 00:35:55,074
You seem like you have a high alcohol tolerance.

741
00:35:55,075 --> 00:35:58,345
No. I used to handle only 2 to 3 glasses of soju.

742
00:35:58,546 --> 00:36:00,746
Now I can keep up with company when I drink.

743
00:36:00,976 --> 00:36:02,075
In the past, I was...

744
00:36:02,416 --> 00:36:04,686
- I brought a book. - What is it about?

745
00:36:05,945 --> 00:36:07,186
It's about motivation.

746
00:36:07,786 --> 00:36:09,154
- I like books like that too. - You do?

747
00:36:09,155 --> 00:36:10,384
- Self-help books. - Self-help books.

748
00:36:10,385 --> 00:36:11,755
(They even have similar tastes.)

749
00:36:12,755 --> 00:36:14,726
First of all, we hit it off.

750
00:36:14,896 --> 00:36:16,255
It's fun to hang out with him.

751
00:36:16,456 --> 00:36:19,226
He makes me feel comfortable and has positive energy.

752
00:36:19,396 --> 00:36:21,995
If he hit on my sister with that kind of energy,

753
00:36:21,996 --> 00:36:23,095
she might fall for him.

754
00:36:25,706 --> 00:36:26,904
(Your sister chose Jung Sub.)

755
00:36:26,905 --> 00:36:28,376
I chose Jung Sub.

756
00:36:28,775 --> 00:36:32,206
I thought we could hit it off.

757
00:36:33,575 --> 00:36:35,674
(Between the two,)

758
00:36:35,675 --> 00:36:39,115
(who can fulfill Cheol Hyeon's brother-in-law fantasy?)

759
00:36:41,686 --> 00:36:43,585
- You never know. - I do think...

760
00:36:43,586 --> 00:36:46,625
Yong Woo is like a big brother you want to follow.

761
00:36:46,626 --> 00:36:47,626
Right.

762
00:36:47,627 --> 00:36:48,694
- His figure as well... - He's the type of guy...

763
00:36:48,695 --> 00:36:49,725
who is popular among guys.

764
00:36:49,726 --> 00:36:52,364
I also think he is one of the oldest there.

765
00:36:52,365 --> 00:36:53,425
Oh, my.

766
00:36:53,666 --> 00:36:54,895
But she can't alter her feelings...

767
00:36:54,896 --> 00:36:56,635
- for his dream brother-in-law. - Right.

768
00:36:57,365 --> 00:36:58,935
Cho A, do whatever you want to do.

769
00:36:58,936 --> 00:37:00,105
- Yes. - Right.

770
00:37:00,106 --> 00:37:01,436
Cho A, you should follow your heart.

771
00:37:01,775 --> 00:37:03,606
Have you talked to Jung Sub?

772
00:37:04,345 --> 00:37:07,145
We haven't really talked,

773
00:37:07,146 --> 00:37:08,174
Okay.

774
00:37:08,175 --> 00:37:11,385
but I felt like he was taking good care of me.

775
00:37:11,516 --> 00:37:12,546
I see.

776
00:37:13,485 --> 00:37:16,916
Once I start to like someone,

777
00:37:17,385 --> 00:37:19,484
I don't really hide my feelings.

778
00:37:19,485 --> 00:37:22,226
I try to take care of him by his side.

779
00:37:22,655 --> 00:37:24,896
So I've been showing my feelings like that.

780
00:37:25,296 --> 00:37:27,635
- Really? - That might be why,

781
00:37:27,735 --> 00:37:31,904
but we made eye contact often.

782
00:37:31,905 --> 00:37:33,775
- I see. - That's how I felt, at least.

783
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:38,005
"Cho A must have chosen Yong Woo."

784
00:37:38,175 --> 00:37:41,215
I was so sure about it all along.

785
00:37:42,876 --> 00:37:45,416
But I guess I don't know her as well as I thought.

786
00:37:46,146 --> 00:37:47,755
He's a little disappointed.

787
00:37:48,255 --> 00:37:49,686
He's too disappointed.

788
00:37:49,985 --> 00:37:52,525
He's disappointed because of who she chose as his brother-in-law.

789
00:37:52,655 --> 00:37:53,726
Exactly.

790
00:37:54,126 --> 00:37:55,396
I received a Cupid Message.

791
00:37:55,825 --> 00:37:57,396
- You did? - Yes.

792
00:37:57,695 --> 00:37:59,865
(A Cupid Message from Ju Yeon)

793
00:38:04,766 --> 00:38:06,335
(Before dinner)

794
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:10,706
I decided to give my Cupid Message to Cheol Hyeon's sister.

795
00:38:11,845 --> 00:38:12,876
Then I...

796
00:38:13,305 --> 00:38:15,845
(Ju Yeon recognized Cheol Hyeon's cupid.)

797
00:38:16,376 --> 00:38:18,484
Yes. I received a Cupid Message.

798
00:38:18,485 --> 00:38:19,485
I see.

799
00:38:19,786 --> 00:38:23,016
(The note has been delivered properly to Cheol Hyeon.)

800
00:38:27,496 --> 00:38:29,226
(Whose sibling do you think she guessed you were?)

801
00:38:29,525 --> 00:38:32,925
She must have guessed I was Cheol Hyeon's sister.

802
00:38:33,226 --> 00:38:34,535
I have a feeling...

803
00:38:34,536 --> 00:38:37,605
that she's detail-oriented and observant.

804
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:39,766
She must have noticed at the start.

805
00:38:40,365 --> 00:38:41,875
- I see what you mean. - Let's see.

806
00:38:41,876 --> 00:38:43,575
- Let me see it too. - I'll read it out loud.

807
00:38:44,146 --> 00:38:46,146
"You worked hard on the first day!"

808
00:38:46,405 --> 00:38:48,916
"Let's have fun and get to know each other."

809
00:38:49,246 --> 00:38:50,345
"How about a restaurant?"

810
00:38:50,945 --> 00:38:52,215
Famous restaurants?

811
00:38:53,885 --> 00:38:55,786
Good places? I like them.

812
00:38:57,885 --> 00:38:59,025
Is it Ju Yeon?

813
00:39:01,655 --> 00:39:03,155
- He got it right away. - You're right!

814
00:39:03,456 --> 00:39:05,395
- Cheol Hyeon seems into her too. - That's good.

815
00:39:05,396 --> 00:39:06,566
- It's nice. - It's so nice.

816
00:39:07,965 --> 00:39:09,195
Is it Ju Yeon?

817
00:39:09,896 --> 00:39:11,005
I think so too.

818
00:39:11,666 --> 00:39:12,666
Well...

819
00:39:12,667 --> 00:39:14,905
(Ju Yeon's heart has been delivered to Cheol Hyeon.)

820
00:39:20,305 --> 00:39:22,215
(Ju Yeon comes back home.)

821
00:39:22,976 --> 00:39:24,586
(Cho A also returns right after her.)

822
00:39:25,786 --> 00:39:27,416
- You're back. - Hello.

823
00:39:27,586 --> 00:39:29,316
- Did you have a good day today? - Yes.

824
00:39:30,825 --> 00:39:32,726
- I had so much fun. - You did?

825
00:39:33,655 --> 00:39:35,295
Right. Since it was our first time facing our sibling.

826
00:39:35,296 --> 00:39:36,296
- Yes. - Right?

827
00:39:36,496 --> 00:39:38,066
- I'm going to go up. - Okay.

828
00:39:40,166 --> 00:39:42,135
(Cho A goes to sleep first as she goes to work tomorrow.)

829
00:39:42,896 --> 00:39:44,505
- Good night. - Good night.

830
00:39:45,235 --> 00:39:46,805
(Everyone goes to sleep one by one.)

831
00:39:48,536 --> 00:39:50,436
- He's cool. Goodness. - Yong Woo.

832
00:39:52,075 --> 00:39:53,816
What? He just walked away.

833
00:39:54,775 --> 00:39:56,115
Oh, dear.

834
00:39:56,275 --> 00:39:57,444
Jonathan is mad.

835
00:39:57,445 --> 00:39:59,016
- Why did you suddenly say that? - My gosh.

836
00:39:59,046 --> 00:40:01,114
It seemed like you didn't know your place when you reacted.

837
00:40:01,115 --> 00:40:02,885
- Why would you say that? - Why?

838
00:40:03,615 --> 00:40:04,785
- Let's be calm. - I'm sorry.

839
00:40:04,786 --> 00:40:06,785
- He was so cool. - It's okay to react like that.

840
00:40:06,786 --> 00:40:07,796
He's really cool.

841
00:40:07,896 --> 00:40:09,924
This is why we can't appear on a show together.

842
00:40:09,925 --> 00:40:11,065
It was just a compliment.

843
00:40:11,066 --> 00:40:12,225
She was out of her place?

844
00:40:12,226 --> 00:40:14,234
I only complimented him, and you suddenly became serious.

845
00:40:14,235 --> 00:40:15,665
Well, Yong Woo is indeed cool.

846
00:40:15,666 --> 00:40:16,935
- He is cool, - Yes, I only said that.

847
00:40:16,936 --> 00:40:19,234
but her reaction was over the top compared to ours.

848
00:40:19,235 --> 00:40:20,574
- He's awesome. - It was a little different.

849
00:40:20,575 --> 00:40:22,274
- She just reacted as a viewer. - Right.

850
00:40:22,275 --> 00:40:23,304
- I did it as a viewer. - "She didn't know her place..."

851
00:40:23,305 --> 00:40:24,646
- "when she reacted." - "She was out of her place."

852
00:40:24,845 --> 00:40:26,904
We can't shoot the same show together.

853
00:40:26,905 --> 00:40:28,115
- What was that? - It was out of line.

854
00:40:28,445 --> 00:40:29,615
Out of line?

855
00:40:30,075 --> 00:40:31,085
It's funny.

856
00:40:31,086 --> 00:40:32,315
- You two are indeed siblings. - That surprised me.

857
00:40:32,316 --> 00:40:33,316
It's hilarious.

858
00:40:42,055 --> 00:40:44,896
(Cheol Hyeon)

859
00:40:47,796 --> 00:40:49,496
(Ju Yeon)

860
00:40:52,436 --> 00:40:54,876
(Jung Sub)

861
00:40:56,936 --> 00:40:58,505
(Se Seung)

862
00:41:01,646 --> 00:41:03,275
(Cho A)

863
00:41:05,885 --> 00:41:07,816
(Yun Ha)

864
00:41:10,925 --> 00:41:12,525
(Jae Hyung)

865
00:41:15,695 --> 00:41:16,896
(Yong Woo)

866
00:41:26,405 --> 00:41:30,575
(My Sibling's Romance)

867
00:41:31,706 --> 00:41:37,345
(Episode 2, It's Okay Since We Are Family)

868
00:41:38,316 --> 00:41:40,586
(Next morning)

869
00:41:44,456 --> 00:41:47,356
(Yong Woo and Jae Hyung's room)

870
00:41:48,856 --> 00:41:50,766
(Jae Hyung wakes up.)

871
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:53,365
(Jae Hyung comes down to the 1st floor.)

872
00:41:55,896 --> 00:41:57,235
(He picks up trash first.)

873
00:42:00,436 --> 00:42:02,606
(He saw a vacuum.)

874
00:42:11,885 --> 00:42:13,215
They say I tidy up as if I owned the place.

875
00:42:13,845 --> 00:42:15,186
They call me a housekeeper.

876
00:42:16,186 --> 00:42:18,485
(The nickname suits him.)

877
00:42:20,286 --> 00:42:22,996
(The living room became clean thanks to the housekeeper.)

878
00:42:23,965 --> 00:42:25,865
(He takes out a Polaroid camera.)

879
00:42:32,106 --> 00:42:34,005
(He suddenly takes a selfie.)

880
00:42:34,206 --> 00:42:36,274
- He loves himself so much. - That's his habit.

881
00:42:36,275 --> 00:42:37,706
He takes selfies habitually.

882
00:42:38,775 --> 00:42:40,646
- It's fun as I see it again. - Yes.

883
00:42:41,215 --> 00:42:42,944
Jae Hyung became a funny person...

884
00:42:42,945 --> 00:42:44,685
- at some point. - I know.

885
00:42:44,686 --> 00:42:45,884
When he appeared at first,

886
00:42:45,885 --> 00:42:47,815
we were like, "He's so handsome."

887
00:42:47,816 --> 00:42:50,015
We said he looked like Gong Yoo and stuff.

888
00:42:50,016 --> 00:42:52,254
In every scene, it feels like I've never seen him.

889
00:42:52,255 --> 00:42:53,255
Yes.

890
00:42:55,325 --> 00:42:57,465
(He takes a morning selfie.)

891
00:43:00,896 --> 00:43:02,535
Drinking warm water,

892
00:43:02,536 --> 00:43:04,666
I took a selfie with a Polaroid camera.

893
00:43:06,365 --> 00:43:08,275
(He displays it in the photo zone.)

894
00:43:14,775 --> 00:43:17,046
(At 8:30am, Cho A wakes up.)

895
00:43:17,516 --> 00:43:21,816
(She's the only one who goes to work today.)

896
00:43:29,396 --> 00:43:31,796
(She takes the Polaroid camera...)

897
00:43:33,626 --> 00:43:34,694
(to go to Se Seung and Ju Yeon's room.)

898
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:35,896
Cho A.

899
00:43:37,036 --> 00:43:39,634
I think you look really pretty with a ponytail.

900
00:43:39,635 --> 00:43:41,536
- Yes. You look graceful. - Yes.

901
00:43:42,005 --> 00:43:44,404
We were all surprised because she looked stunning.

902
00:43:44,405 --> 00:43:46,574
She had a ponytail.

903
00:43:46,575 --> 00:43:50,074
She looked elegant with her neck showing.

904
00:43:50,075 --> 00:43:53,086
So we kept complimenting her. "Why are you so pretty today?"

905
00:43:53,615 --> 00:43:54,654
(She takes a pictures of Ju Yeon and Se Seung.)

906
00:43:54,655 --> 00:43:56,255
In 1, 2, 3.

907
00:43:59,755 --> 00:44:01,996
- Thank you. - Working hard on the makeup.

908
00:44:02,396 --> 00:44:05,895
I don't stay in this space a lot.

909
00:44:05,896 --> 00:44:09,094
So I wanted to contribute.

910
00:44:09,095 --> 00:44:12,734
I remembered we were talking about Polaroid pictures.

911
00:44:12,735 --> 00:44:16,004
Each day is so precious to me.

912
00:44:16,005 --> 00:44:19,205
I thought I'd remember these moments...

913
00:44:19,206 --> 00:44:22,845
if I took pictures. That's why I took a picture of them.

914
00:44:24,316 --> 00:44:26,546
(She goes down with the picture Cho A took.)

915
00:44:27,186 --> 00:44:28,215
Gosh.

916
00:44:29,016 --> 00:44:30,316
Who is he?

917
00:44:31,525 --> 00:44:32,554
Who is it?

918
00:44:32,555 --> 00:44:33,626
(A photo she hasn't seen is on the wall.)

919
00:44:35,195 --> 00:44:36,755
Did you see this, Cho A?

920
00:44:36,896 --> 00:44:40,066
A mysterious man took a selfie.

921
00:44:40,266 --> 00:44:41,436
Who is this?

922
00:44:41,836 --> 00:44:44,235
(A mysterious man?)

923
00:44:44,536 --> 00:44:46,606
- I'm not sure either. - Who is it?

924
00:44:46,965 --> 00:44:48,005
- What? - What?

925
00:44:48,305 --> 00:44:49,905
Are they serious?

926
00:44:50,005 --> 00:44:52,344
- It's not 1 of the 4. - Not 1 of the 4.

927
00:44:52,345 --> 00:44:53,404
Right?

928
00:44:53,405 --> 00:44:55,145
Is he a new guy?

929
00:44:55,146 --> 00:44:56,246
Maybe.

930
00:44:56,945 --> 00:44:57,985
Really?

931
00:44:58,385 --> 00:45:00,384
- What are they talking about? - What are they talking about?

932
00:45:00,385 --> 00:45:01,515
For real?

933
00:45:01,516 --> 00:45:03,456
- It's obviously Jae Hyung. - Did they not recognize him?

934
00:45:03,555 --> 00:45:05,285
I think it's possible that they didn't recognize him.

935
00:45:05,286 --> 00:45:06,424
- Really? - Yes.

936
00:45:06,425 --> 00:45:08,694
I told you. He looks different every time I see him.

937
00:45:08,695 --> 00:45:10,094
It's been here since this morning, right?

938
00:45:10,095 --> 00:45:11,996
- Yes. - It wasn't here until yesterday.

939
00:45:12,695 --> 00:45:15,066
We saw an unfamiliar face.

940
00:45:15,266 --> 00:45:18,864
The guy in the picture was good-looking too.

941
00:45:18,865 --> 00:45:20,005
It made my heart flutter a little.

942
00:45:21,005 --> 00:45:22,036
What?

943
00:45:22,476 --> 00:45:24,505
Oh, my gosh.

944
00:45:26,146 --> 00:45:30,215
I should go and tell them about the emergency.

945
00:45:30,516 --> 00:45:33,286
(The mysterious guy is sleeping soundly again.)

946
00:45:33,816 --> 00:45:36,856
(The sibling of the mysterious guy appears.)

947
00:45:37,115 --> 00:45:38,525
Se Seung, look at this.

948
00:45:41,025 --> 00:45:42,025
What is this?

949
00:45:42,555 --> 00:45:45,694
Cho A said,

950
00:45:45,695 --> 00:45:47,025
"Look at this."

951
00:45:47,325 --> 00:45:49,435
And instinctively, I was like,

952
00:45:49,436 --> 00:45:50,936
"My goodness."

953
00:45:51,266 --> 00:45:54,305
The wink made me frown automatically.

954
00:45:54,505 --> 00:45:57,546
At that moment, it was my instinct.

955
00:45:57,675 --> 00:46:00,876
I couldn't stand it.

956
00:46:03,715 --> 00:46:05,246
(Frowning)

957
00:46:06,816 --> 00:46:07,856
Who is it?

958
00:46:09,115 --> 00:46:10,685
And then I tried to fix it...

959
00:46:10,686 --> 00:46:12,185
and said,

960
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:14,855
"Who is it?"

961
00:46:14,856 --> 00:46:17,455
They saw Jae Hyung only once.

962
00:46:17,456 --> 00:46:20,594
And the half of his face was covered in the picture, so they didn't know.

963
00:46:20,595 --> 00:46:21,935
But I knew at once.

964
00:46:21,936 --> 00:46:23,694
I thought I made a mistake,

965
00:46:23,695 --> 00:46:25,436
so I was like, "I don't know who it is."

966
00:46:25,606 --> 00:46:27,206
I thought they might've noticed that I was his sibling.

967
00:46:27,436 --> 00:46:30,035
We might have a new resident.

968
00:46:30,036 --> 00:46:31,106
Right?

969
00:46:31,805 --> 00:46:36,015
Because he would've not taken the picture otherwise, right?

970
00:46:36,016 --> 00:46:38,445
I should tell them this big news.

971
00:46:39,445 --> 00:46:41,055
I can't believe it.

972
00:46:41,255 --> 00:46:44,355
I got goosebumps.

973
00:46:44,356 --> 00:46:45,385
Is this boiling?

974
00:46:47,186 --> 00:46:48,995
- Oh, my. - She's acting.

975
00:46:48,996 --> 00:46:51,864
- That's method acting. - I told you she was a good actor.

976
00:46:51,865 --> 00:46:53,795
I got chills too.

977
00:46:53,796 --> 00:46:55,066
- Because of her acting? - Yes.

978
00:46:55,296 --> 00:46:58,634
- She's scary. - She can act like that?

979
00:46:58,635 --> 00:47:00,505
(Does Jae Hyung usually take cute selfies?)

980
00:47:00,836 --> 00:47:03,304
Yes. He takes selfies very often.

981
00:47:03,305 --> 00:47:07,444
He leaves photos of himself with stubbles...

982
00:47:07,445 --> 00:47:10,746
or winking secretly.

983
00:47:11,016 --> 00:47:14,215
When I open the album, that's the first picture I see.

984
00:47:14,485 --> 00:47:16,755
That's how he bothers me.

985
00:47:17,286 --> 00:47:18,356
It's annoying.

986
00:47:21,095 --> 00:47:22,126
Hello.

987
00:47:22,555 --> 00:47:24,825
It smells so good.

988
00:47:25,226 --> 00:47:28,266
Don't you work from 10 to 10?

989
00:47:28,496 --> 00:47:30,134
I'll take a taxi.

990
00:47:30,135 --> 00:47:32,066
- You will? - So I'll go out a little late.

991
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:33,905
You remembered it.

992
00:47:34,405 --> 00:47:36,905
Because it's 10 to 10.

993
00:47:39,175 --> 00:47:40,304
Cho A, you should eat quickly.

994
00:47:40,305 --> 00:47:42,045
- You eat 1st. - You eat 1st.

995
00:47:42,046 --> 00:47:43,146
I'll get you seaweed soup.

996
00:47:43,976 --> 00:47:46,845
- Let me eat first. - Yes. Go ahead.

997
00:47:50,615 --> 00:47:53,255
- Inside it... - It's a little hard.

998
00:47:57,255 --> 00:47:58,325
Let's hurry up.

999
00:47:59,965 --> 00:48:02,295
Eat this one.

1000
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:04,265
- Thank you. - Sure.

1001
00:48:04,266 --> 00:48:05,405
(He got her warm rice.)

1002
00:48:07,005 --> 00:48:08,235
(Sliding)

1003
00:48:09,905 --> 00:48:10,936
You're like a mom.

1004
00:48:12,106 --> 00:48:13,905
- You have three moms. - Yes.

1005
00:48:16,775 --> 00:48:18,884
It's like a big family.

1006
00:48:18,885 --> 00:48:21,155
That's why I think it's precious.

1007
00:48:21,916 --> 00:48:25,686
Every moment is precious and makes me happy.

1008
00:48:26,786 --> 00:48:28,296
I guess she felt warmth.

1009
00:48:28,496 --> 00:48:30,324
- She deserves it. - Yes.

1010
00:48:30,325 --> 00:48:31,895
- She deserves to be happy. - See you later.

1011
00:48:31,896 --> 00:48:33,296
See you later.

1012
00:48:33,496 --> 00:48:34,694
- See you. - I think it's right.

1013
00:48:34,695 --> 00:48:35,695
See you.

1014
00:48:36,865 --> 00:48:39,864
(Those who went to work: Cho A, you got this!)

1015
00:48:39,865 --> 00:48:42,435
Is there anyone whose birthday is coming?

1016
00:48:42,436 --> 00:48:43,536
Mine just passed.

1017
00:48:44,235 --> 00:48:45,605
I'm so curious about your age.

1018
00:48:45,606 --> 00:48:46,606
- I know. All of a sudden. - Right?

1019
00:48:46,606 --> 00:48:47,606
As we're talking about age.

1020
00:48:47,607 --> 00:48:49,375
- Seriously. I'm itching for it. - For real. I'm so curious.

1021
00:48:49,376 --> 00:48:51,614
- I can't calculate. - No.

1022
00:48:51,615 --> 00:48:53,714
I should be able to tell how old you guys are,

1023
00:48:53,715 --> 00:48:54,984
but I can't.

1024
00:48:54,985 --> 00:48:56,655
- The thing is... - Yes.

1025
00:48:56,816 --> 00:48:58,186
when you say your name,

1026
00:48:58,286 --> 00:49:00,524
you say, "I'm Park Se Seung," for example.

1027
00:49:00,525 --> 00:49:02,625
- Right. - You don't say, "I'm Se Seung."

1028
00:49:02,626 --> 00:49:04,225
- It feels like you're acting cute. - Right.

1029
00:49:04,226 --> 00:49:06,265
That's why it was so awkward.

1030
00:49:06,266 --> 00:49:07,495
- It was? - Me too.

1031
00:49:07,496 --> 00:49:09,765
The introduction suited you.

1032
00:49:09,766 --> 00:49:11,035
I think it was Jung Sub.

1033
00:49:11,036 --> 00:49:13,004
When I said, "I'm Se Seung,"

1034
00:49:13,005 --> 00:49:15,775
- you were like, "Seung Hee?" - Yes, I did.

1035
00:49:16,476 --> 00:49:19,046
I'm Se Seung.

1036
00:49:19,706 --> 00:49:21,715
- Seung Hee? - Se Seung.

1037
00:49:21,916 --> 00:49:22,944
- Se Seung? - Yes.

1038
00:49:22,945 --> 00:49:24,915
Se as in "semi" and Seung.

1039
00:49:24,916 --> 00:49:26,945
- Se Seung. Okay. - Yes.

1040
00:49:27,715 --> 00:49:30,955
- Did you think it was a mistake? - Some names have four syllables.

1041
00:49:30,956 --> 00:49:34,054
I thought it was something Se Seung Hee.

1042
00:49:34,055 --> 00:49:35,356
I wondered if that was the case.

1043
00:49:35,996 --> 00:49:38,195
Do you know someone whose name is Mo Se Seung Hee?

1044
00:49:39,166 --> 00:49:41,336
It's a very unique name.

1045
00:49:42,496 --> 00:49:43,536
No.

1046
00:49:44,135 --> 00:49:45,365
Why is this funny?

1047
00:49:48,005 --> 00:49:50,106
- Is it that funny? - It's so...

1048
00:49:50,376 --> 00:49:52,775
I didn't say that to be funny.

1049
00:49:53,005 --> 00:49:54,545
But they burst into laughter.

1050
00:49:54,546 --> 00:49:56,646
It wasn't my intention.

1051
00:49:56,715 --> 00:49:58,385
I should show my different charm.

1052
00:49:59,445 --> 00:50:02,785
Cheol Hyeon didn't talk much...

1053
00:50:02,786 --> 00:50:05,025
when he came to the house at first.

1054
00:50:05,456 --> 00:50:08,125
The more I see him, the way he speaks...

1055
00:50:08,126 --> 00:50:11,525
is unique. He's whimsical.

1056
00:50:11,666 --> 00:50:13,766
He jokes out of nowhere,

1057
00:50:13,996 --> 00:50:15,795
which is hilarious.

1058
00:50:15,796 --> 00:50:19,365
He keeps showing different charms.

1059
00:50:19,865 --> 00:50:21,505
(Her sibling who was sleeping got up.)

1060
00:50:23,675 --> 00:50:25,445
(Roaming around)

1061
00:50:26,706 --> 00:50:29,575
Have you eaten?

1062
00:50:29,775 --> 00:50:30,816
Yes.

1063
00:50:32,686 --> 00:50:35,915
He was out of his mind. "Have you eaten?" He spoke casually.

1064
00:50:35,916 --> 00:50:38,186
Fortunately, it was just the two of us.

1065
00:50:38,385 --> 00:50:41,025
I couldn't hold back my laughter at that moment.

1066
00:50:45,726 --> 00:50:47,626
I got confused as I woke up just now.

1067
00:50:48,595 --> 00:50:50,134
After I said, "Have you eaten?"

1068
00:50:50,135 --> 00:50:51,665
I looked around and there was no one.

1069
00:50:51,666 --> 00:50:54,706
I thought I should not lower my guard.

1070
00:51:00,476 --> 00:51:01,575
Is he crazy?

1071
00:51:04,646 --> 00:51:07,384
- Jae Hyung is the funniest. - "Have you eaten?"

1072
00:51:07,385 --> 00:51:09,015
- He's so funny. - Yes.

1073
00:51:09,016 --> 00:51:10,286
It looks like he's been living there for a while.

1074
00:51:15,496 --> 00:51:16,554
- Knock, knock. - Yes?

1075
00:51:16,555 --> 00:51:18,324
Do you have scissors by any chance?

1076
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:19,895
- I do. - You do?

1077
00:51:19,896 --> 00:51:22,595
Yes. It's ten dollars per minute. Are you okay with that?

1078
00:51:22,735 --> 00:51:26,035
As far as I know, washing dishes is 100 dollars per minute.

1079
00:51:26,036 --> 00:51:27,066
Really?

1080
00:51:28,405 --> 00:51:29,975
- The difference is too big. - I can keep the scissors...

1081
00:51:29,976 --> 00:51:31,546
for a long time.

1082
00:51:33,405 --> 00:51:35,214
You're well prepared. Thank you.

1083
00:51:35,215 --> 00:51:36,275
- Oh, my. - Careful.

1084
00:51:36,445 --> 00:51:37,775
- Thank you. - No worries.

1085
00:51:38,485 --> 00:51:41,254
I think Jung Sub and I joke around.

1086
00:51:41,255 --> 00:51:43,685
We have the same sense of humor.

1087
00:51:43,686 --> 00:51:46,984
So I thought...

1088
00:51:46,985 --> 00:51:48,095
we'd get along well.

1089
00:51:48,996 --> 00:51:50,895
She's interested in him.

1090
00:51:50,896 --> 00:51:53,665
- She said "getting along..." - Yes.

1091
00:51:53,666 --> 00:51:55,364
- Right. - because she can't say,

1092
00:51:55,365 --> 00:51:57,864
"I think I love him" from the beginning...

1093
00:51:57,865 --> 00:51:59,265
- when you're interested in someone. - No.

1094
00:51:59,266 --> 00:52:01,065
"I think we click."

1095
00:52:01,066 --> 00:52:02,805
That's how it begins.

1096
00:52:03,235 --> 00:52:04,844
So when someone jokes around like that,

1097
00:52:04,845 --> 00:52:06,405
does it mean they like you?

1098
00:52:06,575 --> 00:52:08,444
- Sorry? - It means they're interested.

1099
00:52:08,445 --> 00:52:09,945
I think you're learning it the wrong way.

1100
00:52:10,945 --> 00:52:13,385
- I think we should make sure. - I'm just saying.

1101
00:52:14,316 --> 00:52:16,516
Stay still. I asked them.

1102
00:52:17,956 --> 00:52:19,455
What is it like?

1103
00:52:19,456 --> 00:52:21,154
When someone jokes around when I did nothing...

1104
00:52:21,155 --> 00:52:23,024
It's not like they love you,

1105
00:52:23,025 --> 00:52:24,665
- but they're interested in you. - Really?

1106
00:52:24,666 --> 00:52:27,795
Have you ever joked around with someone you were not interested in?

1107
00:52:27,796 --> 00:52:29,266
I always joke around.

1108
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:32,436
So you joke around with anyone even when you're not interested?

1109
00:52:32,635 --> 00:52:35,504
When someone jokes around with me,

1110
00:52:35,505 --> 00:52:38,074
- Do they joke around? - does it mean they like me?

1111
00:52:38,075 --> 00:52:39,574
What's important is the kind of joke they make.

1112
00:52:39,575 --> 00:52:41,915
When you think they're joking around, it's a joke.

1113
00:52:41,916 --> 00:52:43,375
If they hit the back of your head,

1114
00:52:43,376 --> 00:52:45,546
- they just hit you. - Seriously.

1115
00:52:46,286 --> 00:52:47,484
- That's violence. - Is that so?

1116
00:52:47,485 --> 00:52:49,154
Yes. You should think about what kind of joke it is.

1117
00:52:49,155 --> 00:52:51,384
- What kind of joke did she make? - Who?

1118
00:52:51,385 --> 00:52:53,125
- Gosh. - No.

1119
00:52:53,126 --> 00:52:54,126
Didn't he ask...

1120
00:52:54,127 --> 00:52:55,595
- because someone joked around? - No.

1121
00:52:55,956 --> 00:52:57,496
Gosh, Patricia.

1122
00:52:58,226 --> 00:52:59,824
He almost fell for it.

1123
00:52:59,825 --> 00:53:02,535
- Patricia. - He almost said it. It's a pity.

1124
00:53:02,536 --> 00:53:03,565
- Gosh. - It was close.

1125
00:53:03,566 --> 00:53:05,305
- Maybe next time. - Shall we watch the video?

1126
00:53:06,106 --> 00:53:07,435
(Se Seung brought a Polaroid camera.)

1127
00:53:07,436 --> 00:53:08,536
Oh, my.

1128
00:53:10,235 --> 00:53:11,505
- Do you want me to take a photo? - Yes.

1129
00:53:12,546 --> 00:53:13,575
Do I look good on camera?

1130
00:53:15,546 --> 00:53:16,615
Do you take nice pictures?

1131
00:53:17,575 --> 00:53:19,586
- Wait. Let me find the angle. - Should I be doing something?

1132
00:53:19,816 --> 00:53:21,516
In 1, 2, 3.

1133
00:53:24,885 --> 00:53:27,055
- I think it'll come out well. - Thank you.

1134
00:53:28,356 --> 00:53:30,396
Se Seung.

1135
00:53:31,525 --> 00:53:32,725
I'm interested in her.

1136
00:53:32,726 --> 00:53:34,735
She took a picture of me.

1137
00:53:35,336 --> 00:53:38,106
"Why does she want to take a picture of me?"

1138
00:53:41,235 --> 00:53:42,305
I posed for no reason.

1139
00:53:42,805 --> 00:53:45,805
She took a picture when I'd look the best...

1140
00:53:46,106 --> 00:53:49,675
as the sun rose to the south.

1141
00:53:50,546 --> 00:53:53,385
It might be her way to express her interest.

1142
00:53:53,546 --> 00:53:54,754
When she took a picture of me,

1143
00:53:54,755 --> 00:53:57,985
it left a strong impression.

1144
00:53:59,425 --> 00:54:01,625
- What? - Things started to twist.

1145
00:54:01,626 --> 00:54:03,226
- Oh, my. - It's a little...

1146
00:54:03,456 --> 00:54:05,325
Take the picture and get it tattooed on your arm.

1147
00:54:07,066 --> 00:54:08,336
But honestly,

1148
00:54:08,496 --> 00:54:10,495
- men get the wrong sign... - Okay.

1149
00:54:10,496 --> 00:54:11,835
- They get the wrong sign? - when women do things like this.

1150
00:54:11,836 --> 00:54:13,765
- Why is that the wrong sign? - And...

1151
00:54:13,766 --> 00:54:15,904
Rather than it's the wrong sign... It could be dangerous.

1152
00:54:15,905 --> 00:54:18,945
- Yes. - He can read too much into it.

1153
00:54:19,146 --> 00:54:20,146
When you take a picture of someone?

1154
00:54:20,147 --> 00:54:22,015
- It makes you reminiscent. - Yes.

1155
00:54:22,016 --> 00:54:24,444
It's a small action,

1156
00:54:24,445 --> 00:54:27,884
and women might've done it without any intention.

1157
00:54:27,885 --> 00:54:29,685
- Right. - But men always go,

1158
00:54:29,686 --> 00:54:30,955
"What's this?"

1159
00:54:30,956 --> 00:54:32,726
"She took a picture of me?"

1160
00:54:33,425 --> 00:54:35,254
- No. Come on. - And...

1161
00:54:35,255 --> 00:54:36,725
- What are you saying? - What's wrong with you?

1162
00:54:36,726 --> 00:54:39,094
- She took a picture of me. - When you look at the photo,

1163
00:54:39,095 --> 00:54:40,665
you can feel the air, temperature, and the humidity.

1164
00:54:40,666 --> 00:54:42,795
- Yes. She took a photo of me. - It reminds you of them.

1165
00:54:42,796 --> 00:54:46,705
I think it's a little different because it's a Polaroid picture.

1166
00:54:46,706 --> 00:54:48,274
- It can mean different. - It's possible.

1167
00:54:48,275 --> 00:54:50,435
It'd make my heart flutter so much.

1168
00:54:50,436 --> 00:54:52,404
I told you. Polaroid pictures are dangerous.

1169
00:54:52,405 --> 00:54:54,245
When they sell Polaroid cameras or films,

1170
00:54:54,246 --> 00:54:56,876
they write, "Save your memories and emotions."

1171
00:54:57,376 --> 00:55:00,315
- It's different. - They're for loved ones.

1172
00:55:00,316 --> 00:55:01,456
I got it.

1173
00:55:01,916 --> 00:55:04,984
Do you want to play bowling after doing grocery shopping?

1174
00:55:04,985 --> 00:55:05,985
Sounds good.

1175
00:55:07,025 --> 00:55:08,895
We're leaving in ten minutes.

1176
00:55:08,896 --> 00:55:10,795
There are many things to play with.

1177
00:55:10,796 --> 00:55:11,865
- There are? - Yes.

1178
00:55:19,336 --> 00:55:21,606
- A good shot. - Yes.

1179
00:55:21,805 --> 00:55:23,634
Do you play basketball?

1180
00:55:23,635 --> 00:55:25,405
No. I can only shoot.

1181
00:55:32,345 --> 00:55:34,586
(The posture isn't important.)

1182
00:55:41,155 --> 00:55:42,626
- Gosh. - Oh, my.

1183
00:55:42,896 --> 00:55:44,766
- A dunk shot? Yong Woo! - Oh, my.

1184
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:47,195
That's amazing.

1185
00:55:47,825 --> 00:55:51,135
Yong Woo is like a character in "Slam Dunk."

1186
00:55:53,036 --> 00:55:54,235
Oh, my.

1187
00:55:55,036 --> 00:55:57,905
- Gosh. - He did it backward. Yong Woo.

1188
00:55:58,476 --> 00:55:59,606
Oh, my goodness.

1189
00:56:00,845 --> 00:56:02,876
The dunk was amazing.

1190
00:56:03,215 --> 00:56:06,246
His posture was so good. Is he a basketball player?

1191
00:56:06,385 --> 00:56:10,316
I think he's likely to be a basketball player.

1192
00:56:10,456 --> 00:56:12,385
I love sports.

1193
00:56:12,626 --> 00:56:15,654
I brought several trophies to my high school...

1194
00:56:15,655 --> 00:56:16,925
in the regional competitions.

1195
00:56:22,735 --> 00:56:24,396
Gosh. Why are you so good?

1196
00:56:25,235 --> 00:56:27,206
- That's so cool. - Did you see his dunk?

1197
00:56:27,505 --> 00:56:29,004
- Show us. - A dunk?

1198
00:56:29,005 --> 00:56:30,575
- Yes. - His dunk is amazing.

1199
00:56:32,175 --> 00:56:33,206
Oh, my gosh.

1200
00:56:36,416 --> 00:56:37,575
How did he do that?

1201
00:56:39,146 --> 00:56:40,586
Why is he so fast?

1202
00:56:41,516 --> 00:56:43,115
- Yes. - His dunk is amazing.

1203
00:56:44,755 --> 00:56:45,856
Oh, my gosh.

1204
00:56:47,155 --> 00:56:48,424
Do you play basketball?

1205
00:56:48,425 --> 00:56:49,425
I love basketball.

1206
00:56:50,095 --> 00:56:53,296
When he shot dunks, he looked so cool.

1207
00:56:53,566 --> 00:56:57,666
He looked like the captain of a basketball team in a cartoon.

1208
00:56:57,965 --> 00:57:00,805
Men who are good at sports are attractive.

1209
00:57:02,876 --> 00:57:04,735
- This opens. - This opens.

1210
00:57:05,945 --> 00:57:07,005
Hi.

1211
00:57:07,305 --> 00:57:08,714
- This opens. - Hello.

1212
00:57:08,715 --> 00:57:10,546
It's so cool when it's open.

1213
00:57:10,916 --> 00:57:12,786
- It's cold, Jae Hyung. - Okay.

1214
00:57:15,985 --> 00:57:17,415
Be careful, will you?

1215
00:57:17,416 --> 00:57:19,985
It's the second day. But you lowered your guard already.

1216
00:57:20,155 --> 00:57:21,155
I'm sorry.

1217
00:57:23,655 --> 00:57:25,865
My brother lowered his guard.

1218
00:57:26,066 --> 00:57:27,925
So I told him to get it together.

1219
00:57:28,266 --> 00:57:30,436
- There are many things to enjoy. - There is velcro.

1220
00:57:30,695 --> 00:57:33,066
- I want to go and play too. - Would you like to join us?

1221
00:57:33,405 --> 00:57:34,436
I'll do it later.

1222
00:57:35,405 --> 00:57:38,775
Why does he never participate?

1223
00:57:39,646 --> 00:57:41,275
He doesn't want to sweat.

1224
00:57:42,175 --> 00:57:43,646
My goodness.

1225
00:57:46,186 --> 00:57:48,015
He thinks he's too precious.

1226
00:57:48,016 --> 00:57:49,816
Please say something to him.

1227
00:57:51,086 --> 00:57:52,884
- Does it go this way? - Okay.

1228
00:57:52,885 --> 00:57:54,995
You can throw at anyone. You can toss it up too.

1229
00:57:54,996 --> 00:57:56,095
Throw it.

1230
00:57:56,456 --> 00:57:58,054
Look at Jae Hyung.

1231
00:57:58,055 --> 00:58:00,865
He's watching inside, peeking through the window.

1232
00:58:02,965 --> 00:58:04,194
- Are you left-handed? - It was nice.

1233
00:58:04,195 --> 00:58:05,706
No. Oh, right.

1234
00:58:05,865 --> 00:58:06,935
She threw it well with her left hand.

1235
00:58:06,936 --> 00:58:07,964
It was really nice.

1236
00:58:07,965 --> 00:58:10,574
- I know. It was so good just now. - Yes. It was really good.

1237
00:58:10,575 --> 00:58:11,976
So this is how you do it.

1238
00:58:13,746 --> 00:58:14,774
Toss.

1239
00:58:14,775 --> 00:58:16,315
- Nice. - Okay.

1240
00:58:16,316 --> 00:58:17,714
- I got the hang of it. - It feels good.

1241
00:58:17,715 --> 00:58:18,786
Try doing it for a moment.

1242
00:58:19,215 --> 00:58:20,285
I'm sorry.

1243
00:58:20,286 --> 00:58:23,356
- Goodness. - His arms are really long.

1244
00:58:25,226 --> 00:58:26,355
She's good.

1245
00:58:26,356 --> 00:58:28,055
- I think she's really good. - It hurts.

1246
00:58:28,825 --> 00:58:31,395
- I want to play basketball too. - Try it.

1247
00:58:31,396 --> 00:58:33,424
I'm really bad at it.

1248
00:58:33,425 --> 00:58:34,425
Stand here.

1249
00:58:34,426 --> 00:58:36,165
- Here? - It'll be blocked otherwise.

1250
00:58:36,166 --> 00:58:37,295
(He moves the stand for her.)

1251
00:58:37,296 --> 00:58:38,805
Is it better to throw the ball here?

1252
00:58:39,505 --> 00:58:41,066
- Oh, my. - Like this.

1253
00:58:41,305 --> 00:58:42,575
- Awesome. - This is better.

1254
00:58:43,005 --> 00:58:46,376
Aim the line above the box.

1255
00:58:47,945 --> 00:58:49,945
- Okay. - It was good.

1256
00:58:50,275 --> 00:58:51,345
Nice.

1257
00:58:51,646 --> 00:58:54,045
- I'm good. - Do you play sports?

1258
00:58:54,046 --> 00:58:56,615
You have talent in sports.

1259
00:59:00,456 --> 00:59:01,456
It's so...

1260
00:59:01,726 --> 00:59:03,194
- Oh, no. - What?

1261
00:59:03,195 --> 00:59:04,754
- What was it? - Did you see that?

1262
00:59:04,755 --> 00:59:06,165
- Oh, my. - Hold on.

1263
00:59:06,166 --> 00:59:07,324
I saw it.

1264
00:59:07,325 --> 00:59:10,765
I think Se Seung is very athletic.

1265
00:59:10,766 --> 00:59:13,336
She looked like Ohtani when she shot the ball.

1266
00:59:14,206 --> 00:59:18,004
I didn't expect her to be athletic...

1267
00:59:18,005 --> 00:59:20,705
and participate in activities.

1268
00:59:20,706 --> 00:59:21,976
And she was good at it too.

1269
00:59:22,376 --> 00:59:23,916
It was a new side.

1270
00:59:24,775 --> 00:59:26,585
Can you get wine for me?

1271
00:59:26,586 --> 00:59:27,685
- Wine? - Yes.

1272
00:59:27,686 --> 00:59:29,086
- Wine and... - White wine?

1273
00:59:29,186 --> 00:59:31,355
- Jae Hyung doesn't even move. - Jae Hyung...

1274
00:59:31,356 --> 00:59:33,025
drinks wine and takes selfies.

1275
00:59:33,786 --> 00:59:36,425
- He's just enjoying himself. - He's on a vacation, isn't he?

1276
00:59:36,695 --> 00:59:39,225
- But he cleans. - Right. He cleans.

1277
00:59:39,226 --> 00:59:40,495
A man who cleans might be more attractive...

1278
00:59:40,496 --> 00:59:41,795
than a man who plays basketball.

1279
00:59:41,796 --> 00:59:43,566
- But no one saw him cleaning. - I know.

1280
00:59:43,865 --> 00:59:45,665
Can you get wine for me?

1281
00:59:45,666 --> 00:59:46,804
- Wine? - Yes.

1282
00:59:46,805 --> 00:59:48,035
- Wine and... - White wine?

1283
00:59:48,036 --> 00:59:50,634
If we're going for white wine, get one made from Sauvignon blanc.

1284
00:59:50,635 --> 00:59:53,976
Or Riesling.

1285
00:59:54,075 --> 00:59:56,645
- You know well. - As for red wine...

1286
00:59:56,646 --> 00:59:58,586
He knows everything.

1287
00:59:58,746 --> 01:00:01,085
My brother is a picky eater.

1288
01:00:01,086 --> 01:00:03,614
He asked them to get wine.

1289
01:00:03,615 --> 01:00:06,355
And he talked about certain kinds of grapes.

1290
01:00:06,356 --> 01:00:08,796
He's a snob.

1291
01:00:10,796 --> 01:00:13,095
We're back to our warm house.

1292
01:00:13,566 --> 01:00:15,765
- It's our home. - Home sweet home.

1293
01:00:15,766 --> 01:00:16,895
- Ju Yeon is home. - She's home.

1294
01:00:16,896 --> 01:00:18,235
She's home.

1295
01:00:18,766 --> 01:00:19,766
We're back.

1296
01:00:19,767 --> 01:00:21,405
- We're back. - We're back.

1297
01:00:22,936 --> 01:00:24,004
I want to do it.

1298
01:00:24,005 --> 01:00:25,575
- You're back. - You're right.

1299
01:00:26,175 --> 01:00:28,105
This goes to the freezer.

1300
01:00:28,106 --> 01:00:30,174
Where should we store it?

1301
01:00:30,175 --> 01:00:32,214
I think it's better...

1302
01:00:32,215 --> 01:00:34,186
- to put it there. - I agree.

1303
01:00:34,845 --> 01:00:35,884
We got bread too.

1304
01:00:35,885 --> 01:00:37,154
- You did? - Yes.

1305
01:00:37,155 --> 01:00:39,225
- It's 100 percent whole wheat. - It'd be delicious.

1306
01:00:39,226 --> 01:00:42,154
This is pain de campagne.

1307
01:00:42,155 --> 01:00:43,225
- "Pain de campagne?" - Yes.

1308
01:00:43,226 --> 01:00:44,396
What's that?

1309
01:00:44,956 --> 01:00:46,795
It translates as "country bread."

1310
01:00:46,796 --> 01:00:47,965
I see.

1311
01:00:49,436 --> 01:00:50,496
Thank you.

1312
01:00:51,595 --> 01:00:52,635
Gosh.

1313
01:00:53,266 --> 01:00:54,266
It smells nice, doesn't it?

1314
01:00:54,606 --> 01:00:56,405
It tastes like "country bread," right?

1315
01:00:58,106 --> 01:01:00,206
Shall we play together?

1316
01:01:00,706 --> 01:01:03,016
- Rebound or what? - How about an alley-oop?

1317
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:07,786
- Gosh. - Okay.

1318
01:01:07,945 --> 01:01:08,984
What?

1319
01:01:08,985 --> 01:01:10,555
- Okay. - This is it.

1320
01:01:10,816 --> 01:01:11,825
That was cool.

1321
01:01:13,126 --> 01:01:14,726
It's so cool.

1322
01:01:15,925 --> 01:01:18,195
There you go. Nice.

1323
01:01:18,965 --> 01:01:20,695
They're playing basketball again?

1324
01:01:22,365 --> 01:01:24,965
There you go. You're amazing.

1325
01:01:25,865 --> 01:01:28,134
- So you played... - Yes.

1326
01:01:28,135 --> 01:01:29,876
basketball in high school. What else did you do?

1327
01:01:30,675 --> 01:01:32,175
I didn't know there were badminton rackets too.

1328
01:01:32,976 --> 01:01:34,775
- He's finally out. - He's finally moving.

1329
01:01:35,046 --> 01:01:36,844
- He's finally out. - Is he a night owl?

1330
01:01:36,845 --> 01:01:38,016
I'm curious.

1331
01:01:39,345 --> 01:01:40,345
(He found badminton rackets.)

1332
01:01:40,346 --> 01:01:41,485
What's this?

1333
01:01:43,016 --> 01:01:44,484
Are you good at badminton?

1334
01:01:44,485 --> 01:01:47,025
I'm not good at badminton.

1335
01:01:47,286 --> 01:01:48,425
I rarely played it.

1336
01:01:49,396 --> 01:01:51,356
(He made a big decision to get ready to be sweaty.)

1337
01:01:58,166 --> 01:02:00,165
Hold on.

1338
01:02:00,166 --> 01:02:01,875
I fell too hard.

1339
01:02:01,876 --> 01:02:02,904
- Oh, no. - Are you okay?

1340
01:02:02,905 --> 01:02:04,404
Your hands must've been scratched a lot.

1341
01:02:04,405 --> 01:02:06,645
No, they haven't. I fell on my side.

1342
01:02:06,646 --> 01:02:07,745
- It's okay. - Are you okay?

1343
01:02:07,746 --> 01:02:08,816
Take a close look at your hands.

1344
01:02:09,416 --> 01:02:12,385
- I think your hands are scratched. - They're not at all.

1345
01:02:12,586 --> 01:02:13,944
Fortunately, he fell here.

1346
01:02:13,945 --> 01:02:17,315
- As I was sliding, I slid. - I know. It's a relief.

1347
01:02:17,316 --> 01:02:19,186
I thought he was dancing a little.

1348
01:02:19,626 --> 01:02:21,254
- He fell safely. - I know.

1349
01:02:21,255 --> 01:02:22,424
- He should brush himself off. - I shouldn't play badminton.

1350
01:02:22,425 --> 01:02:24,155
- Here. - I'm not playing badminton.

1351
01:02:24,425 --> 01:02:25,425
(He bans himself from doing outdoor activities.)

1352
01:02:25,426 --> 01:02:27,765
- He's sulky. - Don't lower your guard.

1353
01:02:27,766 --> 01:02:28,835
I'm not playing.

1354
01:02:28,836 --> 01:02:31,234
It's because it's a slope.

1355
01:02:31,235 --> 01:02:32,835
You should brush yourself off here.

1356
01:02:32,836 --> 01:02:34,206
- Where? - Here.

1357
01:02:38,476 --> 01:02:42,115
I'm quite good at badminton.

1358
01:02:42,316 --> 01:02:45,816
But my body wasn't warmed up, and it was cold.

1359
01:02:46,186 --> 01:02:49,316
My feet twisted, and the ground was slippery.

1360
01:02:49,715 --> 01:02:53,255
I wasn't wearing sportswear.

1361
01:02:54,786 --> 01:02:55,855
Oh, my.

1362
01:02:55,856 --> 01:02:57,654
Don't make excuses.

1363
01:02:57,655 --> 01:02:59,194
He should smile a little.

1364
01:02:59,195 --> 01:03:00,766
He's so charming.

1365
01:03:01,496 --> 01:03:03,735
Come to think of it, he must've been so embarrassed.

1366
01:03:03,996 --> 01:03:07,336
But the way he fell wasn't embarrassing.

1367
01:03:07,666 --> 01:03:10,876
He fell beautifully. Like he was doing ballet.

1368
01:03:11,135 --> 01:03:12,775
I get injured often.

1369
01:03:13,805 --> 01:03:17,416
Se Seung must've been worried a lot.

1370
01:03:18,646 --> 01:03:20,215
What's wrong with him?

1371
01:03:22,255 --> 01:03:23,255
I feel bad.

1372
01:03:27,525 --> 01:03:28,925
Don't be serious.

1373
01:03:32,465 --> 01:03:34,226
Starting today, I'll root for Jae Hyung.

1374
01:03:35,635 --> 01:03:37,594
- All I care about is Jae Hyung. - I'm rather worried.

1375
01:03:37,595 --> 01:03:38,606
My Jae Hyung.

1376
01:03:39,735 --> 01:03:40,735
Are you okay?

1377
01:03:40,736 --> 01:03:42,074
Anything on my back?

1378
01:03:42,075 --> 01:03:44,774
It's amazing. Your clothes didn't get dirty when you fell.

1379
01:03:44,775 --> 01:03:47,146
- Right. - You barely got hurt.

1380
01:03:47,305 --> 01:03:48,305
Let's go.

1381
01:03:48,306 --> 01:03:49,445
(Off to the bowling alley)

1382
01:03:49,775 --> 01:03:51,174
Anyone wants to ride with Jung Sub?

1383
01:03:51,175 --> 01:03:53,316
- We'll go. - Thanks.

1384
01:03:55,046 --> 01:03:56,254
- Hello. - Hello.

1385
01:03:56,255 --> 01:03:57,255
Hello.

1386
01:03:58,086 --> 01:04:00,054
I'm not sure if I can go bowling...

1387
01:04:00,055 --> 01:04:01,485
- because of my finger. - Play with your left hand.

1388
01:04:01,856 --> 01:04:04,694
Isn't it your left hand that's hurt? Is your right hand in pain too?

1389
01:04:04,695 --> 01:04:06,464
No, just my left hand.

1390
01:04:06,465 --> 01:04:08,365
But it still puts weight on my left hand.

1391
01:04:08,666 --> 01:04:11,565
You should be careful today.

1392
01:04:11,566 --> 01:04:14,365
Jae Hyung, I have the tiger ointment.

1393
01:04:15,836 --> 01:04:18,336
- Really? - You really brought everything.

1394
01:04:18,706 --> 01:04:21,275
- Because I get hurt easily. - Later...

1395
01:04:21,575 --> 01:04:23,114
- Gosh. - Let me borrow it later.

1396
01:04:23,115 --> 01:04:24,816
- That's unbelievable. - I'll lend it to you later.

1397
01:04:24,916 --> 01:04:27,016
Se Seung, is there anything you can't eat?

1398
01:04:27,385 --> 01:04:29,654
- Trotter. - Really?

1399
01:04:29,655 --> 01:04:30,685
- Yes. - Trotter?

1400
01:04:30,686 --> 01:04:32,555
Because of the smell.

1401
01:04:33,985 --> 01:04:35,185
Because it stinks?

1402
01:04:35,186 --> 01:04:37,594
Yes, I can't eat any meat that smells.

1403
01:04:37,595 --> 01:04:39,125
What about lamb skewers?

1404
01:04:39,126 --> 01:04:40,324
Lamb skewers are good.

1405
01:04:40,325 --> 01:04:41,694
- Well... - Anything with no smell is fine.

1406
01:04:41,695 --> 01:04:43,996
There's a really good place in Euljiro.

1407
01:04:44,235 --> 01:04:47,205
It's not that I can't eat chicken feet or entrails.

1408
01:04:47,206 --> 01:04:49,804
I don't like chicken feet because they look weird.

1409
01:04:49,805 --> 01:04:50,976
I'm the same.

1410
01:04:51,805 --> 01:04:53,675
- But I like entrails. - Entrails...

1411
01:04:54,305 --> 01:04:55,975
Jae Hyung and Se Seung are...

1412
01:04:55,976 --> 01:04:58,816
carefree.

1413
01:04:59,286 --> 01:05:00,985
How can they be so comfortable?

1414
01:05:01,086 --> 01:05:04,255
This is just my guess,

1415
01:05:04,356 --> 01:05:06,456
but I think they're guaranteed. They're faking it.

1416
01:05:08,555 --> 01:05:11,626
Because Jae Hyung and Se Seung...

1417
01:05:12,496 --> 01:05:14,364
They don't...

1418
01:05:14,365 --> 01:05:16,166
look alike at all.

1419
01:05:16,635 --> 01:05:20,536
They have different vibes.

1420
01:05:21,606 --> 01:05:23,174
Rather than siblings,

1421
01:05:23,175 --> 01:05:25,005
they're more like the only child from two families.

1422
01:05:25,845 --> 01:05:27,375
You'd be disappointed...

1423
01:05:27,376 --> 01:05:30,715
that I noticed it right away.

1424
01:05:31,016 --> 01:05:32,685
If they were siblings,

1425
01:05:32,686 --> 01:05:34,916
they'd fight every day.

1426
01:05:35,555 --> 01:05:37,885
Let's hit her.

1427
01:05:39,385 --> 01:05:40,755
Hey!

1428
01:05:42,195 --> 01:05:44,824
(They did fight every day.)

1429
01:05:44,825 --> 01:05:46,165
If you cry, you look ugly.

1430
01:05:46,166 --> 01:05:47,695
Don't cry on your birthday.

1431
01:05:48,095 --> 01:05:52,535
(Bowling alley)

1432
01:05:52,536 --> 01:05:53,935
- Really? - When we go out...

1433
01:05:53,936 --> 01:05:55,304
We talked about it.

1434
01:05:55,305 --> 01:05:56,505
- Really? - Hello.

1435
01:05:58,305 --> 01:05:59,444
- There are... - This is nice.

1436
01:05:59,445 --> 01:06:00,706
seven of us.

1437
01:06:00,805 --> 01:06:02,746
But only six people are going to play.

1438
01:06:03,146 --> 01:06:04,175
One person is...

1439
01:06:04,376 --> 01:06:05,746
Your names?

1440
01:06:05,816 --> 01:06:07,246
It's Lee Yong Woo.

1441
01:06:08,786 --> 01:06:10,114
- Wait a minute. - Wait.

1442
01:06:10,115 --> 01:06:12,155
Wait. Everyone, cover your ears.

1443
01:06:12,456 --> 01:06:14,555
Wait. We shouldn't say our last names.

1444
01:06:16,396 --> 01:06:17,456
Right.

1445
01:06:17,856 --> 01:06:19,464
We'll pretend we didn't hear it.

1446
01:06:19,465 --> 01:06:21,465
Let's have one person say it at a time.

1447
01:06:25,865 --> 01:06:27,066
How can I...

1448
01:06:28,465 --> 01:06:30,335
- My goodness. - What's wrong?

1449
01:06:30,336 --> 01:06:32,404
No, it's nothing.

1450
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:35,175
I'm sorry. I did my best.

1451
01:06:35,275 --> 01:06:37,845
When I was asked, I thought I was here to bowl.

1452
01:06:39,146 --> 01:06:40,985
I ruined it. Sorry.

1453
01:06:41,485 --> 01:06:43,015
Everyone was surprised,

1454
01:06:43,016 --> 01:06:46,255
but Cheol Hyeon didn't know what was going on.

1455
01:06:46,925 --> 01:06:49,025
I didn't realize it at first.

1456
01:06:49,126 --> 01:06:53,166
I guess I was too immersed.

1457
01:06:55,566 --> 01:06:59,105
I think it's here. Number five. It's right here.

1458
01:06:59,106 --> 01:07:00,135
It's really warm in here.

1459
01:07:00,536 --> 01:07:01,804
Let's divide into teams.

1460
01:07:01,805 --> 01:07:02,935
- Yes. Sounds good. - Teams?

1461
01:07:02,936 --> 01:07:04,634
Let's decide the members first and see if we'll give a handicap.

1462
01:07:04,635 --> 01:07:05,904
- I'm really bad at it. - Let's decide that first.

1463
01:07:05,905 --> 01:07:07,305
- Okay. - Anyone who's bad at it?

1464
01:07:09,516 --> 01:07:11,145
I think we should divide...

1465
01:07:11,146 --> 01:07:13,214
like this to make things easier.

1466
01:07:13,215 --> 01:07:14,384
- Is that okay? - Yes.

1467
01:07:14,385 --> 01:07:15,385
Shall we start?

1468
01:07:15,386 --> 01:07:16,955
- Yes. - You can go first.

1469
01:07:16,956 --> 01:07:17,956
- Me first? - Yes.

1470
01:07:17,957 --> 01:07:19,186
Oh, good.

1471
01:07:20,055 --> 01:07:21,155
Right away?

1472
01:07:23,255 --> 01:07:24,524
- Is that okay? - How did you do that?

1473
01:07:24,525 --> 01:07:25,595
You were so cool.

1474
01:07:25,965 --> 01:07:27,694
- You looked cool when you threw it. - What was that?

1475
01:07:27,695 --> 01:07:29,796
- Was that okay? - You deserve applause.

1476
01:07:31,436 --> 01:07:34,504
One, two, three, four. Go.

1477
01:07:34,505 --> 01:07:36,075
- What? - Good.

1478
01:07:36,635 --> 01:07:37,635
Oh, nice.

1479
01:07:42,005 --> 01:07:44,816
- Oh, that's so straight. - You're very good.

1480
01:07:53,025 --> 01:07:54,925
Nice. That's crazy.

1481
01:07:56,095 --> 01:07:57,095
Okay.

1482
01:07:57,096 --> 01:07:58,795
You can do it.

1483
01:07:58,796 --> 01:08:00,425
- Good job. - You're very good.

1484
01:08:01,226 --> 01:08:03,935
He was better at bowling than I expected.

1485
01:08:03,936 --> 01:08:06,235
He was very good at it that he looked cool.

1486
01:08:07,666 --> 01:08:09,706
When you move forward,

1487
01:08:09,975 --> 01:08:12,545
keep your feet like this...

1488
01:08:12,546 --> 01:08:14,246
and stand as straight as you can.

1489
01:08:15,105 --> 01:08:19,015
And move forward like this. One, two, three.

1490
01:08:19,386 --> 01:08:21,245
No need to rush.

1491
01:08:21,246 --> 01:08:23,155
Take it slow like you're rolling.

1492
01:08:23,515 --> 01:08:24,756
- Let me try. - What matters is that we win.

1493
01:08:27,956 --> 01:08:29,596
- That's good. - You got it.

1494
01:08:29,695 --> 01:08:31,625
Good. That was very nice.

1495
01:08:31,626 --> 01:08:32,626
It's spinning.

1496
01:08:33,225 --> 01:08:35,125
- Awesome. - Nice.

1497
01:08:35,126 --> 01:08:37,135
- That was good. - Nice.

1498
01:08:37,136 --> 01:08:38,364
Nice.

1499
01:08:38,365 --> 01:08:39,706
- Good. - We're in trouble now.

1500
01:08:40,265 --> 01:08:42,275
Can you fix my posture one more time?

1501
01:08:42,475 --> 01:08:43,835
- Your posture? - I was able to do it...

1502
01:08:43,836 --> 01:08:44,836
because you fixed my posture.

1503
01:08:45,746 --> 01:08:46,975
This is how you walk.

1504
01:08:47,475 --> 01:08:50,346
If you bend down, it'll be easier.

1505
01:08:50,546 --> 01:08:52,014
Should I just crawl?

1506
01:08:52,015 --> 01:08:53,015
Good.

1507
01:08:53,016 --> 01:08:54,886
Or you could do this.

1508
01:08:56,515 --> 01:08:57,614
Okay.

1509
01:08:57,615 --> 01:08:59,626
Let's hit a strike before we leave.

1510
01:09:01,756 --> 01:09:02,795
- One each. - Okay.

1511
01:09:02,796 --> 01:09:05,895
The man who's interested in my sibling is...

1512
01:09:06,166 --> 01:09:07,166
Cheol Hyeon.

1513
01:09:08,096 --> 01:09:11,036
I saw them talking together.

1514
01:09:11,136 --> 01:09:12,665
I realized...

1515
01:09:12,666 --> 01:09:16,405
how my sibling would look to others.

1516
01:09:16,905 --> 01:09:19,445
I'm starting to realize a new side of her.

1517
01:09:20,006 --> 01:09:21,845
Do I get a lesson on my posture?

1518
01:09:21,846 --> 01:09:23,376
- A posture lesson? - I really don't know how to play.

1519
01:09:23,815 --> 01:09:25,916
To see is to believe.

1520
01:09:26,046 --> 01:09:27,546
- Okay. - Let me see your play first.

1521
01:09:32,586 --> 01:09:34,524
We need to tell her about the posture.

1522
01:09:34,525 --> 01:09:37,126
- Yes. - That's why I asked.

1523
01:09:38,996 --> 01:09:40,426
- Are you right-handed? - Yes.

1524
01:09:41,395 --> 01:09:43,966
You're supposed to start from here.

1525
01:09:44,065 --> 01:09:47,234
Since we use our right arm, move a little bit to the side.

1526
01:09:47,235 --> 01:09:48,335
Just a little off to the side.

1527
01:09:48,336 --> 01:09:50,335
Imagine you have ink on your hand...

1528
01:09:50,336 --> 01:09:51,835
and spread the ink in a straight line.

1529
01:09:51,836 --> 01:09:53,376
There's a difference between letting the ball from up here...

1530
01:09:53,475 --> 01:09:55,274
and rolling from down here.

1531
01:09:55,275 --> 01:09:56,376
I got it.

1532
01:09:56,846 --> 01:09:59,285
Jung Sub taught me the details...

1533
01:09:59,286 --> 01:10:01,145
one by one slowly.

1534
01:10:01,246 --> 01:10:04,654
Because he has a nice voice, it's easy to understand.

1535
01:10:04,655 --> 01:10:06,056
He sounds stable.

1536
01:10:06,325 --> 01:10:08,085
- Good luck. - Good luck.

1537
01:10:08,086 --> 01:10:09,626
Focus on the arrow in front of you.

1538
01:10:11,195 --> 01:10:13,394
Roll. Okay.

1539
01:10:13,395 --> 01:10:14,864
- It's moving outward. - It bounced.

1540
01:10:14,865 --> 01:10:16,296
- Oh, it's going in. What? - You got it.

1541
01:10:20,006 --> 01:10:21,864
- He's very calm. - Why are you...

1542
01:10:21,865 --> 01:10:24,975
At first, she looked like a beginner.

1543
01:10:25,275 --> 01:10:27,775
Then she suddenly became good at it. It was amazing.

1544
01:10:28,046 --> 01:10:32,015
She was doing her best. I could see that she was trying.

1545
01:10:32,886 --> 01:10:35,216
I fell for it. That appealed to me.

1546
01:10:36,386 --> 01:10:37,386
Stop.

1547
01:10:38,286 --> 01:10:39,655
- What? - You got it.

1548
01:10:39,756 --> 01:10:41,556
All you have to do is to roll it.

1549
01:10:41,586 --> 01:10:43,125
(She improved so much.)

1550
01:10:43,126 --> 01:10:45,625
- Okay. - Good job. Nice.

1551
01:10:45,626 --> 01:10:46,695
You placed first.

1552
01:10:47,695 --> 01:10:50,365
Jung Sub gave me a good lesson,

1553
01:10:50,466 --> 01:10:54,235
and by implementing his teaching,

1554
01:10:54,435 --> 01:10:55,905
I achieved a good result.

1555
01:10:56,636 --> 01:10:57,836
Jae Hyung, are you okay?

1556
01:10:58,075 --> 01:11:01,404
I think I should go see a doctor.

1557
01:11:01,405 --> 01:11:02,815
Are you going now?

1558
01:11:03,575 --> 01:11:05,574
I'm going to go see a doctor.

1559
01:11:05,575 --> 01:11:07,245
- I'll meet you at home. - Okay.

1560
01:11:07,246 --> 01:11:08,545
Okay. See you later.

1561
01:11:08,546 --> 01:11:09,814
- Are you coming home later? - Bye.

1562
01:11:09,815 --> 01:11:11,786
(Jae Hyung's going to see a doctor.)

1563
01:11:12,855 --> 01:11:14,855
This is the last lap.

1564
01:11:18,825 --> 01:11:20,325
How is he so stable?

1565
01:11:23,365 --> 01:11:24,966
He's amazing.

1566
01:11:30,006 --> 01:11:31,206
- It works better here. - He got it.

1567
01:11:34,376 --> 01:11:35,475
Good job.

1568
01:11:37,645 --> 01:11:40,445
- Nice. It's a strike. - Good job.

1569
01:11:42,655 --> 01:11:44,255
That was close.

1570
01:11:44,256 --> 01:11:46,155
- You almost had it. - How did I miss it?

1571
01:11:46,256 --> 01:11:47,455
Good job.

1572
01:11:47,456 --> 01:11:49,024
- Well done. - Well done.

1573
01:11:49,025 --> 01:11:50,755
I admit that I lost.

1574
01:11:50,756 --> 01:11:52,996
- It was neck and neck. - Right.

1575
01:11:53,096 --> 01:11:54,895
- Good job. - Okay.

1576
01:11:55,096 --> 01:11:56,836
- It was short and intense. - Yes.

1577
01:11:57,265 --> 01:11:58,295
I have a question.

1578
01:11:58,296 --> 01:12:01,235
Do women like it when men stand out here?

1579
01:12:01,666 --> 01:12:03,434
- What? - Is there someone you like?

1580
01:12:03,435 --> 01:12:06,545
I'm still a student. I'm just studying.

1581
01:12:06,546 --> 01:12:08,245
When a man is good at sports,

1582
01:12:08,246 --> 01:12:10,375
- women are interested. - Women like it.

1583
01:12:10,376 --> 01:12:11,376
Really?

1584
01:12:11,377 --> 01:12:13,485
This is the part where people are mistaken.

1585
01:12:13,815 --> 01:12:15,685
"I did well. She must be into me now."

1586
01:12:15,786 --> 01:12:18,014
- We always make that mistake. - Right.

1587
01:12:18,015 --> 01:12:21,255
- Okay. - It gives you credits,

1588
01:12:21,256 --> 01:12:23,854
but as you get older,

1589
01:12:23,855 --> 01:12:25,155
you realize those credits don't really mean anything.

1590
01:12:25,695 --> 01:12:28,224
- Right. - If I was in the 50 range,

1591
01:12:28,225 --> 01:12:29,894
I thought I could change it to the 90 range.

1592
01:12:29,895 --> 01:12:30,934
It's not that much.

1593
01:12:30,935 --> 01:12:32,195
- Only a little bit. - But about 50.5.

1594
01:12:35,006 --> 01:12:37,104
(On the way back home)

1595
01:12:37,105 --> 01:12:39,846
My shoulders are in pain already.

1596
01:12:40,275 --> 01:12:42,614
I think I was lucky today.

1597
01:12:42,615 --> 01:12:44,216
I was never this good before.

1598
01:12:44,676 --> 01:12:48,115
Everyone was good at it. They picked up very fast.

1599
01:12:48,985 --> 01:12:50,485
How did they learn so fast?

1600
01:12:51,155 --> 01:12:52,555
Everyone's so fast.

1601
01:12:52,556 --> 01:12:54,256
How do you teach so well?

1602
01:12:55,355 --> 01:12:56,355
Right?

1603
01:12:56,356 --> 01:12:57,756
I wasn't that good.

1604
01:12:57,996 --> 01:12:59,265
The standard example of bowling.

1605
01:13:05,466 --> 01:13:06,905
What do you look for in a guy when you're in a relationship?

1606
01:13:10,905 --> 01:13:12,036
When I'm in a relationship?

1607
01:13:13,046 --> 01:13:16,115
I check if we're on the same wavelength.

1608
01:13:16,216 --> 01:13:17,346
And...

1609
01:13:18,145 --> 01:13:20,586
whether he's sweet?

1610
01:13:21,916 --> 01:13:23,315
- Sweet? - Sweet.

1611
01:13:24,185 --> 01:13:26,485
I like people on the same wavelength too.

1612
01:13:28,325 --> 01:13:29,894
You never know until you talk to them.

1613
01:13:29,895 --> 01:13:30,926
Right.

1614
01:13:31,956 --> 01:13:35,096
I got to talk to Jung Sub a lot today.

1615
01:13:35,796 --> 01:13:37,966
He asked me questions first.

1616
01:13:38,065 --> 01:13:40,234
Then he talked about something we had in common.

1617
01:13:40,235 --> 01:13:41,904
Like, "I like that too."

1618
01:13:41,905 --> 01:13:44,136
"I don't eat that either."

1619
01:13:44,235 --> 01:13:46,206
Then he asked me...

1620
01:13:46,546 --> 01:13:48,306
what I focus on when I'm in a relationship.

1621
01:13:48,706 --> 01:13:51,246
So I thought he was curious about me.

1622
01:13:53,185 --> 01:13:55,546
- Well done today. - Well done.

1623
01:13:56,786 --> 01:13:58,056
It's home.

1624
01:13:59,015 --> 01:14:00,385
I'm expecting...

1625
01:14:00,386 --> 01:14:02,285
- to feel warmth inside. - Right.

1626
01:14:02,286 --> 01:14:03,355
It's so cold.

1627
01:14:04,155 --> 01:14:05,394
Home sweet home.

1628
01:14:05,395 --> 01:14:07,264
- Right. - Home sweet home.

1629
01:14:07,265 --> 01:14:09,394
- Home sweet home. - We're home.

1630
01:14:09,395 --> 01:14:11,535
- We're home. - We're home.

1631
01:14:11,536 --> 01:14:13,434
- We're home. - We're home.

1632
01:14:13,435 --> 01:14:15,006
- We're home. - We're home.

1633
01:14:15,405 --> 01:14:17,706
What about dinner?

1634
01:14:17,975 --> 01:14:19,176
Okay then.

1635
01:14:19,275 --> 01:14:22,075
We have just enough braised kimchi left.

1636
01:14:22,176 --> 01:14:24,876
How about braised kimchi and doenjang jjigae for dinner?

1637
01:14:26,416 --> 01:14:27,484
- He keeps talking... - Braised kimchi again.

1638
01:14:27,485 --> 01:14:28,585
about braised kimchi.

1639
01:14:28,586 --> 01:14:30,314
- He never stops talking about it. - Please eat it.

1640
01:14:30,315 --> 01:14:32,386
- Hurry up. - They have to eat it.

1641
01:14:32,485 --> 01:14:33,724
They have to eat braised kimchi today.

1642
01:14:33,725 --> 01:14:34,825
- They couldn't have it last night. - They have to.

1643
01:14:34,926 --> 01:14:37,024
- Right. - They only had kimchi last night.

1644
01:14:37,025 --> 01:14:38,654
- Right. - They have to have it tonight.

1645
01:14:38,655 --> 01:14:39,996
How did he braise it?

1646
01:14:40,725 --> 01:14:42,394
He braised it with meat.

1647
01:14:42,395 --> 01:14:43,735
(Braised kimchi viral marketing)

1648
01:14:43,836 --> 01:14:45,064
It smells good already.

1649
01:14:45,065 --> 01:14:46,565
- Right? - Help yourselves.

1650
01:14:46,905 --> 01:14:49,206
- Enjoy. - Enjoy.

1651
01:14:50,935 --> 01:14:52,575
- Do you like it? - Is it good?

1652
01:14:52,676 --> 01:14:55,206
- Thank you. - Okay. Let's eat.

1653
01:14:56,645 --> 01:14:57,975
Okay. It's black pepper.

1654
01:14:59,645 --> 01:15:01,144
You mixed them?

1655
01:15:01,145 --> 01:15:03,515
- It's cooked. - Let me try it.

1656
01:15:04,485 --> 01:15:07,086
(Jung Sub is back.)

1657
01:15:10,395 --> 01:15:11,725
- Who is it? - He's back.

1658
01:15:12,195 --> 01:15:13,195
He's back.

1659
01:15:13,395 --> 01:15:14,764
- Jung Sub. - Welcome back.

1660
01:15:14,765 --> 01:15:16,165
- Let's eat. - Hello.

1661
01:15:16,166 --> 01:15:17,435
- Welcome back. - Jung Sub.

1662
01:15:17,695 --> 01:15:19,365
Something smells good.

1663
01:15:19,865 --> 01:15:21,434
- This is a perfect timing. - Thank you.

1664
01:15:21,435 --> 01:15:23,175
- Right. - It's a perfect timing.

1665
01:15:23,176 --> 01:15:24,505
Come and dig in now.

1666
01:15:24,506 --> 01:15:26,605
You know when you can eat.

1667
01:15:26,806 --> 01:15:29,444
Sit down. Get changed and sit down now.

1668
01:15:29,445 --> 01:15:30,575
Right. Hurry up.

1669
01:15:33,445 --> 01:15:34,916
"Sit down now."

1670
01:15:35,015 --> 01:15:36,814
- What's that supposed to mean? - "Now."

1671
01:15:36,815 --> 01:15:37,915
She's taking care of him.

1672
01:15:37,916 --> 01:15:40,525
Like a mom who wants to give him warm food.

1673
01:15:40,786 --> 01:15:42,556
"Sit down now" was a bit ambiguous.

1674
01:15:43,155 --> 01:15:45,654
I think we should focus on how she got up immediately.

1675
01:15:45,655 --> 01:15:47,296
- Right. - Her speed.

1676
01:15:48,225 --> 01:15:50,465
After Cho A left,

1677
01:15:50,466 --> 01:15:51,495
a lot of things happened.

1678
01:15:51,496 --> 01:15:53,265
Right. A lot of things happened.

1679
01:15:53,466 --> 01:15:55,136
- It's such a bummer. - I know.

1680
01:15:56,605 --> 01:15:58,435
- Is this how moms feel? - Yes.

1681
01:16:01,475 --> 01:16:02,645
Eat up.

1682
01:16:03,575 --> 01:16:04,645
Your ears are red.

1683
01:16:05,015 --> 01:16:06,346
I know. What's wrong with me?

1684
01:16:06,746 --> 01:16:08,786
- Because it's cold. - Because it's cold?

1685
01:16:13,426 --> 01:16:15,455
- Gosh, this is so good. - Don't you love it?

1686
01:16:15,456 --> 01:16:16,456
Really?

1687
01:16:16,855 --> 01:16:19,825
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1688
01:16:21,596 --> 01:16:23,264
I guess Koreans need rice.

1689
01:16:23,265 --> 01:16:24,265
Right.

1690
01:16:25,136 --> 01:16:27,234
Doenjang jjigae...

1691
01:16:27,235 --> 01:16:28,435
- warmed me up. - Yes.

1692
01:16:29,065 --> 01:16:31,506
(Rummaging)

1693
01:16:31,935 --> 01:16:34,145
- What's wrong? - I know.

1694
01:16:34,246 --> 01:16:35,506
You can't get it?

1695
01:16:37,275 --> 01:16:39,415
- I'll make one for you, Yun Ha. - Oh, no.

1696
01:16:39,416 --> 01:16:41,645
I got two perilla leaves.

1697
01:16:43,355 --> 01:16:44,386
I'll help you.

1698
01:16:45,855 --> 01:16:47,025
Thank you.

1699
01:16:49,025 --> 01:16:50,926
These perilla leaves are so good.

1700
01:16:51,956 --> 01:16:53,796
Oh, they're good.

1701
01:16:54,065 --> 01:16:56,036
- Did you get it from the store? - Did you get it from the store?

1702
01:16:56,365 --> 01:16:59,435
No, Young Gi's mom got it from the farm.

1703
01:17:00,206 --> 01:17:01,466
- Sweet potatoes. - Sweet potatoes.

1704
01:17:02,806 --> 01:17:03,876
- Yam. - Yam.

1705
01:17:04,676 --> 01:17:05,706
Yes.

1706
01:17:06,945 --> 01:17:07,945
No.

1707
01:17:08,046 --> 01:17:09,575
We have Na Moon Hee visiting us.

1708
01:17:11,315 --> 01:17:13,215
He was a bit timid when he did it.

1709
01:17:13,216 --> 01:17:15,715
Is that supposed to be that funny? I'm getting confused.

1710
01:17:15,716 --> 01:17:16,755
- She's blinded. - Yes.

1711
01:17:16,756 --> 01:17:18,115
- She's blinded by love. - That's strange.

1712
01:17:19,015 --> 01:17:20,224
They're alike.

1713
01:17:20,225 --> 01:17:21,385
She's listening carefully because she likes him.

1714
01:17:21,386 --> 01:17:23,194
Right. She's listening to him because she likes him.

1715
01:17:23,195 --> 01:17:24,255
If she wasn't interested, she wouldn't listen to him.

1716
01:17:24,256 --> 01:17:25,395
- Of course. - She'd ignore him.

1717
01:17:25,525 --> 01:17:28,996
Even though I only met Jung Sub,

1718
01:17:29,096 --> 01:17:31,995
we recognize the things...

1719
01:17:31,996 --> 01:17:33,405
we say to ourselves.

1720
01:17:33,605 --> 01:17:37,074
So I thought...

1721
01:17:37,075 --> 01:17:38,176
we'd get along.

1722
01:17:41,546 --> 01:17:44,015
When will Cho A be here? It's already 10pm.

1723
01:17:44,546 --> 01:17:47,515
It'd be a perfect timing if she's home now.

1724
01:17:48,216 --> 01:17:49,416
Do you think she had dinner?

1725
01:17:51,386 --> 01:17:55,355
(Cho A is off work at 10:26pm.)

1726
01:17:59,596 --> 01:18:00,825
- I'm going to. - Is that Cho A?

1727
01:18:01,796 --> 01:18:04,035
- Who is it? - Cho A?

1728
01:18:04,036 --> 01:18:05,036
Is it Cho A?

1729
01:18:09,006 --> 01:18:11,006
- It's me. - Welcome.

1730
01:18:11,206 --> 01:18:12,235
Welcome back.

1731
01:18:12,506 --> 01:18:15,876
Did you have a good day? Did you have dinner?

1732
01:18:16,346 --> 01:18:17,444
No, not yet.

1733
01:18:17,445 --> 01:18:18,445
- No? - That's perfect.

1734
01:18:18,445 --> 01:18:19,445
You should come...

1735
01:18:19,446 --> 01:18:21,315
- and eat everything here. - It's okay.

1736
01:18:22,115 --> 01:18:23,185
You can finish everything.

1737
01:18:23,716 --> 01:18:25,956
- Well done today. - Well done today.

1738
01:18:26,386 --> 01:18:27,386
Welcome home.

1739
01:18:27,786 --> 01:18:30,095
Let's see who prepares the meal for her.

1740
01:18:30,096 --> 01:18:32,225
- Get up. - She hasn't had dinner yet.

1741
01:18:33,195 --> 01:18:35,626
It was already past 10pm.

1742
01:18:36,935 --> 01:18:39,765
I've always wanted to talk to her...

1743
01:18:39,935 --> 01:18:40,966
since the first day.

1744
01:18:45,435 --> 01:18:47,574
- Look who it is. - I'm home.

1745
01:18:47,575 --> 01:18:49,545
Who are you? I haven't seen you all day.

1746
01:18:49,546 --> 01:18:50,944
- Who am I? - Who are you?

1747
01:18:50,945 --> 01:18:53,545
You forgot about me already?

1748
01:18:53,546 --> 01:18:54,746
- Well done. - I'm disappointed.

1749
01:18:55,185 --> 01:18:57,456
I wanted to spend some more time with her,

1750
01:18:57,556 --> 01:18:59,014
but I knew she'd be tired.

1751
01:18:59,015 --> 01:19:01,484
So I thought I should let her...

1752
01:19:01,485 --> 01:19:03,126
do what she wanted.

1753
01:19:03,825 --> 01:19:05,595
Is he not going to talk to her...

1754
01:19:05,596 --> 01:19:07,425
just to be nice?

1755
01:19:07,426 --> 01:19:09,796
- Oh, that is... - Because she might be tired?

1756
01:19:09,895 --> 01:19:13,536
Maybe. He might be worried about her.

1757
01:19:13,836 --> 01:19:15,435
What's taking Cho A so long?

1758
01:19:15,666 --> 01:19:17,206
Maybe she's still getting changed?

1759
01:19:17,676 --> 01:19:20,246
(Jung Sub heads upstairs.)

1760
01:19:20,346 --> 01:19:22,046
- Cho A? - Yes?

1761
01:19:22,445 --> 01:19:24,876
- You haven't had dinner yet, right? - No.

1762
01:19:24,975 --> 01:19:27,845
- Do you like eggs? - I like eggs.

1763
01:19:27,846 --> 01:19:29,515
- Okay. - Okay.

1764
01:19:30,416 --> 01:19:32,814
I asked Cho A if she had dinner yet.

1765
01:19:32,815 --> 01:19:34,655
She said she hadn't.

1766
01:19:35,025 --> 01:19:37,194
Cho A was the one...

1767
01:19:37,195 --> 01:19:38,224
I wanted to talk to.

1768
01:19:38,225 --> 01:19:39,865
Cho A looked...

1769
01:19:40,895 --> 01:19:42,166
interesting.

1770
01:19:42,265 --> 01:19:44,235
I was curious about her.

1771
01:19:48,036 --> 01:19:49,505
- Hello. - Hello.

1772
01:19:49,506 --> 01:19:51,176
- Hello. - Hello.

1773
01:19:52,036 --> 01:19:53,445
- Jung Sub? - Yes.

1774
01:19:54,206 --> 01:19:56,775
I wanted to get to know her more. I wanted to talk to her.

1775
01:20:00,886 --> 01:20:04,715
Interest. That'd be the exact word.

1776
01:20:04,716 --> 01:20:06,586
But Cho A was so busy.

1777
01:20:06,685 --> 01:20:10,096
I didn't have a chance to communicate with her.

1778
01:20:10,195 --> 01:20:13,126
All I could think about was to cook for her.

1779
01:20:13,626 --> 01:20:15,725
- Oh, cook her a new meal? - Cool.

1780
01:20:16,195 --> 01:20:17,595
It seems Jung Sub is...

1781
01:20:17,596 --> 01:20:19,535
- very enthusiastic. - Right.

1782
01:20:19,536 --> 01:20:21,136
That's why I'm jealous of good cooks.

1783
01:20:23,506 --> 01:20:24,575
Are you cooking something?

1784
01:20:25,006 --> 01:20:26,806
Yes, something simple.

1785
01:20:42,895 --> 01:20:44,355
Oh, the heat is high.

1786
01:20:45,626 --> 01:20:47,996
(For Cho A who worked until late,)

1787
01:20:48,195 --> 01:20:50,194
(he made rolled omelet from inferno.)

1788
01:20:50,195 --> 01:20:51,195
It's doomed.

1789
01:20:52,536 --> 01:20:53,536
(Groaning)

1790
01:20:54,206 --> 01:20:55,404
The heat is too high.

1791
01:20:55,405 --> 01:20:57,206
I'm sorry. I shouldn't laugh.

1792
01:20:57,506 --> 01:20:58,676
- The heat is too high. - It's burnt.

1793
01:20:59,006 --> 01:21:01,205
- The heat was too strong. - Wait.

1794
01:21:01,206 --> 01:21:03,074
How's that different from my food?

1795
01:21:03,075 --> 01:21:04,115
(Laughing)

1796
01:21:04,615 --> 01:21:06,585
Unless there's a ring inside,

1797
01:21:06,586 --> 01:21:07,586
it's unforgivable.

1798
01:21:07,815 --> 01:21:09,716
- That's the only way. - Right.

1799
01:21:10,315 --> 01:21:11,315
When he said the heat was strong,

1800
01:21:11,316 --> 01:21:12,885
he sounded like an expert.

1801
01:21:12,886 --> 01:21:15,386
When he said the heat was strong, the heat was strong literally.

1802
01:21:15,485 --> 01:21:18,324
- He was only testing the heat. - How can he do that?

1803
01:21:18,325 --> 01:21:19,455
- It's all burnt. - But...

1804
01:21:19,456 --> 01:21:20,595
he could fix it.

1805
01:21:20,596 --> 01:21:22,095
He could add rice and make fried rice instead.

1806
01:21:22,096 --> 01:21:23,734
I don't think so.

1807
01:21:23,735 --> 01:21:25,336
- Can't you see the dark lump? - That is...

1808
01:21:27,966 --> 01:21:28,966
It's doomed.

1809
01:21:30,105 --> 01:21:31,206
Oh, it's doomed.

1810
01:21:31,676 --> 01:21:33,306
Something smells burnt.

1811
01:21:34,105 --> 01:21:35,445
Don't say it's doomed.

1812
01:21:35,546 --> 01:21:36,615
Then?

1813
01:21:37,145 --> 01:21:38,145
That it's great?

1814
01:21:38,146 --> 01:21:39,985
Yes. Say it's great.

1815
01:21:40,086 --> 01:21:42,445
But to say that...

1816
01:21:44,586 --> 01:21:45,985
It's not seasoned at all.

1817
01:21:47,025 --> 01:21:49,425
I tried to make a nice rolled omelet,

1818
01:21:49,426 --> 01:21:50,525
but it was very hard.

1819
01:21:52,695 --> 01:21:53,824
That looks edible.

1820
01:21:53,825 --> 01:21:54,966
That's not bad.

1821
01:21:55,865 --> 01:21:56,865
Just say you bought it.

1822
01:21:59,136 --> 01:22:00,166
Are you a scammer?

1823
01:22:00,836 --> 01:22:01,836
That'd be better.

1824
01:22:01,837 --> 01:22:03,275
Say you ran to the restaurant and bought it.

1825
01:22:05,235 --> 01:22:06,705
Did you make it yourself?

1826
01:22:06,706 --> 01:22:08,846
Oh, this is nothing.

1827
01:22:09,176 --> 01:22:10,216
This is terrible.

1828
01:22:10,846 --> 01:22:12,175
Are you ready to eat?

1829
01:22:12,176 --> 01:22:14,615
- Just eat this. - Oh, we have this too.

1830
01:22:14,916 --> 01:22:16,285
Thank you.

1831
01:22:16,286 --> 01:22:17,586
- Enjoy. - Thank you.

1832
01:22:19,685 --> 01:22:21,286
(Exclaiming)

1833
01:22:27,426 --> 01:22:30,235
(The chef couldn't watch her eating and left.)

1834
01:22:32,336 --> 01:22:36,105
It's nice to have a homemade meal. I'm so happy.

1835
01:22:36,265 --> 01:22:37,676
Do you live with your parents?

1836
01:22:38,405 --> 01:22:40,846
No. Because I live on my own,

1837
01:22:42,506 --> 01:22:44,615
I'm happy when I have homemade food.

1838
01:22:45,046 --> 01:22:47,114
Right. It tastes different, right?

1839
01:22:47,115 --> 01:22:48,115
Yes.

1840
01:22:51,185 --> 01:22:53,155
How's the egg?

1841
01:22:54,725 --> 01:22:57,725
(He couldn't refuse to ask her.)

1842
01:22:58,126 --> 01:23:00,524
He cooked on a high heat.

1843
01:23:00,525 --> 01:23:02,925
- What's she supposed to say? - That's cute.

1844
01:23:02,926 --> 01:23:04,595
I get it now.

1845
01:23:04,596 --> 01:23:06,194
He was staying away because he ruined it.

1846
01:23:06,195 --> 01:23:08,035
But it kept bugging him, so he decided to ask her.

1847
01:23:08,036 --> 01:23:09,135
He was curious.

1848
01:23:09,136 --> 01:23:10,404
"How's the egg?"

1849
01:23:10,405 --> 01:23:11,635
I wish she'd say, "It's hot."

1850
01:23:11,636 --> 01:23:14,376
It's funny how he contemplated.

1851
01:23:14,605 --> 01:23:15,645
That was so cute.

1852
01:23:17,275 --> 01:23:18,275
He's determined.

1853
01:23:18,716 --> 01:23:20,285
- It tastes different, right? - Yes.

1854
01:23:20,286 --> 01:23:21,886
You're going to use the washer?

1855
01:23:23,855 --> 01:23:25,886
Well, how's the egg?

1856
01:23:26,185 --> 01:23:27,185
It's so good.

1857
01:23:27,825 --> 01:23:28,825
- Really? - Yes.

1858
01:23:29,456 --> 01:23:31,096
- Really? - Do you have a recipe?

1859
01:23:31,195 --> 01:23:32,195
No.

1860
01:23:32,196 --> 01:23:33,466
- Really? - No.

1861
01:23:33,626 --> 01:23:35,724
- Already... - She said it was good.

1862
01:23:35,725 --> 01:23:37,465
- She's so nice. - She's so nice.

1863
01:23:37,466 --> 01:23:38,495
- Really. - She's so nice.

1864
01:23:38,496 --> 01:23:40,306
She asked if he had a recipe.

1865
01:23:41,536 --> 01:23:43,064
It might be true when she said it was good.

1866
01:23:43,065 --> 01:23:46,005
Aside from the taste, it's obvious that there's no recipe.

1867
01:23:46,006 --> 01:23:47,006
- Right. - Is she an angel?

1868
01:23:47,405 --> 01:23:49,075
- Really? - Do you have a recipe?

1869
01:23:49,176 --> 01:23:50,176
No.

1870
01:23:50,177 --> 01:23:51,376
- Really? - No.

1871
01:23:51,575 --> 01:23:52,916
(I see.)

1872
01:23:54,015 --> 01:23:55,085
(I see.)

1873
01:23:55,086 --> 01:23:56,286
Did you salt it?

1874
01:23:56,485 --> 01:23:58,485
You must be... Are you tired?

1875
01:24:01,426 --> 01:24:02,725
I was grateful.

1876
01:24:02,985 --> 01:24:04,926
I didn't do much for her.

1877
01:24:05,025 --> 01:24:06,564
Yet she enjoyed it.

1878
01:24:06,565 --> 01:24:08,764
This also occurs to me.

1879
01:24:08,765 --> 01:24:12,264
While we were talking at the meal table,

1880
01:24:12,265 --> 01:24:13,805
it suddenly occurred to me. "Wait a minute."

1881
01:24:13,806 --> 01:24:15,905
"This person I'm talking to."

1882
01:24:16,235 --> 01:24:18,104
"She must be..."

1883
01:24:18,105 --> 01:24:20,105
"someone's sister."

1884
01:24:20,346 --> 01:24:21,974
"What would he be thinking?"

1885
01:24:21,975 --> 01:24:23,815
I was curious about that.

1886
01:24:24,645 --> 01:24:26,614
You must be... Are you tired?

1887
01:24:26,615 --> 01:24:28,145
(Glancing)

1888
01:24:29,786 --> 01:24:32,514
When Jung Sub joined us for a meal,

1889
01:24:32,515 --> 01:24:34,626
he only grabbed what was in the fridge.

1890
01:24:34,725 --> 01:24:37,324
He was making scrambled eggs.

1891
01:24:37,325 --> 01:24:39,556
So I was like, "Wait."

1892
01:24:40,096 --> 01:24:41,565
"He wouldn't do that unless he was interested in her."

1893
01:24:41,895 --> 01:24:44,995
He made a special dish only for you two.

1894
01:24:44,996 --> 01:24:46,295
- Really? - Really?

1895
01:24:46,296 --> 01:24:47,564
Only for you two.

1896
01:24:47,565 --> 01:24:49,335
- Really? - He ate what was in the fridge.

1897
01:24:49,336 --> 01:24:50,676
You didn't have it earlier?

1898
01:24:51,176 --> 01:24:53,274
Jung Sub could have been tired,

1899
01:24:53,275 --> 01:24:56,274
but he cooked scrambled eggs.

1900
01:24:56,275 --> 01:24:57,546
I think that's meaningful.

1901
01:25:01,546 --> 01:25:03,586
(Yong Woo comes to the table.)

1902
01:25:04,216 --> 01:25:05,315
How was work?

1903
01:25:06,015 --> 01:25:07,185
Busy.

1904
01:25:07,256 --> 01:25:09,525
Seriously, you came at 10pm.

1905
01:25:09,926 --> 01:25:11,194
- Seriously. - Seriously.

1906
01:25:11,195 --> 01:25:12,956
Still, I took a taxi and came fast.

1907
01:25:14,025 --> 01:25:15,495
- Welcome. - I got off work exactly on time.

1908
01:25:15,496 --> 01:25:16,565
You got off work exactly on time.

1909
01:25:16,765 --> 01:25:20,206
We went bowling today, and it was a lot of fun.

1910
01:25:20,365 --> 01:25:22,506
When we go and play pocket billiards,

1911
01:25:22,636 --> 01:25:24,735
it will be nice if you can join us.

1912
01:25:25,176 --> 01:25:26,235
That sounds good.

1913
01:25:27,605 --> 01:25:28,775
Do you like it?

1914
01:25:29,246 --> 01:25:30,546
I must have played it once or twice.

1915
01:25:30,615 --> 01:25:31,716
- Once or twice? - Yes.

1916
01:25:33,386 --> 01:25:35,415
Yong Woo becomes awkward...

1917
01:25:35,416 --> 01:25:36,955
- in front of Cho A. - Pocket billiards.

1918
01:25:36,956 --> 01:25:38,985
- I know. - Yong Woo, go and play basketball.

1919
01:25:39,515 --> 01:25:41,324
- That's right. He should show her. - Yes.

1920
01:25:41,325 --> 01:25:42,825
Do a dunk shot and hang from the basket.

1921
01:25:46,096 --> 01:25:47,325
Then they will start dating the next day.

1922
01:25:49,496 --> 01:25:50,996
- We won. - Were you on the winning team?

1923
01:25:51,136 --> 01:25:53,605
I was on the winning team and...

1924
01:25:53,966 --> 01:25:56,676
- Yong Woo was on the losing team. - Thinking about it now...

1925
01:25:57,136 --> 01:25:58,835
- brings pain... - What?

1926
01:25:58,836 --> 01:26:00,846
for the 2nd and 3rd times.

1927
01:26:01,605 --> 01:26:02,706
Don't talk about it.

1928
01:26:02,846 --> 01:26:04,474
May I be happy now?

1929
01:26:04,475 --> 01:26:06,474
I want to be happy now.

1930
01:26:06,475 --> 01:26:08,315
All right.

1931
01:26:10,015 --> 01:26:11,556
Jae Hyung isn't back yet.

1932
01:26:12,716 --> 01:26:13,786
He is here.

1933
01:26:14,355 --> 01:26:16,425
- He is here. - Is it Jae Hyung?

1934
01:26:16,426 --> 01:26:18,256
- Jae Hyung, are you okay? - How is it?

1935
01:26:18,626 --> 01:26:20,324
How is it? What did the doctor say?

1936
01:26:20,325 --> 01:26:23,064
I think I will need to go back tomorrow.

1937
01:26:23,065 --> 01:26:24,364
You haven't had dinner yet, right?

1938
01:26:24,365 --> 01:26:25,395
No.

1939
01:26:25,996 --> 01:26:27,206
- You are back. - Yes.

1940
01:26:27,336 --> 01:26:28,404
What happened?

1941
01:26:28,405 --> 01:26:31,105
I will need to go back to the hospital tomorrow.

1942
01:26:31,405 --> 01:26:34,944
What did the doctor say? Did your bone break?

1943
01:26:34,945 --> 01:26:36,444
I don't know that yet.

1944
01:26:36,445 --> 01:26:38,216
- I need to get an X-ray again. - You don't know that yet.

1945
01:26:38,376 --> 01:26:40,746
- I see. - I plan to go tomorrow.

1946
01:26:45,115 --> 01:26:47,155
Gosh, I am exhausted.

1947
01:26:52,596 --> 01:26:56,225
Jae Hyung, do you need Tiger Balm by any chance?

1948
01:26:56,865 --> 01:26:58,264
- I see that your finger is covered. - Yes.

1949
01:26:58,265 --> 01:26:59,394
How about your knees?

1950
01:26:59,395 --> 01:27:01,465
I was very worried...

1951
01:27:01,466 --> 01:27:03,264
because he didn't join us to shop for groceries...

1952
01:27:03,265 --> 01:27:04,676
or go bowling.

1953
01:27:04,935 --> 01:27:06,905
He has three weeks ahead of him,

1954
01:27:07,806 --> 01:27:09,846
so I was very worried.

1955
01:27:14,115 --> 01:27:15,245
Thank you for the food.

1956
01:27:15,246 --> 01:27:17,484
You forced yourself to eat everything.

1957
01:27:17,485 --> 01:27:18,814
- It was tasty. - Thank you.

1958
01:27:18,815 --> 01:27:20,585
I ate everything because it was tasty.

1959
01:27:20,586 --> 01:27:21,855
Thank you so much.

1960
01:27:22,256 --> 01:27:24,456
I have a luxurious taste.

1961
01:27:24,796 --> 01:27:25,956
It seems that way.

1962
01:27:26,695 --> 01:27:27,796
How so?

1963
01:27:29,296 --> 01:27:30,666
Why does it seem that way?

1964
01:27:31,296 --> 01:27:33,635
- I can tell. - How can you tell?

1965
01:27:33,636 --> 01:27:35,235
- I can tell. - How so?

1966
01:27:36,006 --> 01:27:37,275
There is a way.

1967
01:27:37,935 --> 01:27:39,475
Hurry up and tell me.

1968
01:27:39,506 --> 01:27:40,574
- Is it a hunch? - I will tell you later.

1969
01:27:40,575 --> 01:27:41,575
- Well... - How about that?

1970
01:27:41,576 --> 01:27:43,945
- I will tell you in 3 weeks. - In 3 weeks?

1971
01:27:52,355 --> 01:27:54,055
- Do you want a drink? - A drink?

1972
01:27:54,056 --> 01:27:55,086
Yes.

1973
01:27:56,556 --> 01:27:58,556
What? I did it.

1974
01:27:58,996 --> 01:28:00,065
- Did you do it? - Yes.

1975
01:28:00,765 --> 01:28:01,765
- Really? - Yes.

1976
01:28:02,996 --> 01:28:04,865
- Good. - Good.

1977
01:28:05,395 --> 01:28:07,434
- Did you get it? - I think so.

1978
01:28:07,435 --> 01:28:08,435
I...

1979
01:28:08,436 --> 01:28:10,035
Shouldn't we add that?

1980
01:28:10,036 --> 01:28:11,904
- What? Yes. - Did you go?

1981
01:28:11,905 --> 01:28:12,934
Yes, I did.

1982
01:28:12,935 --> 01:28:14,075
Hold on.

1983
01:28:15,876 --> 01:28:18,315
We need to send a message. We received a message.

1984
01:28:19,115 --> 01:28:20,144
Really?

1985
01:28:20,145 --> 01:28:21,345
(On the second day, who made your heart flutter?)

1986
01:28:21,346 --> 01:28:23,514
(Send the name and message and we will deliver it anonymously.)

1987
01:28:23,515 --> 01:28:25,416
I forgot about that.

1988
01:28:27,056 --> 01:28:28,685
- What message? - That time has come.

1989
01:28:28,825 --> 01:28:30,096
Is it that time?

1990
01:28:30,926 --> 01:28:33,256
Gosh, I missed this so much.

1991
01:28:35,765 --> 01:28:37,935
- Really? What message? - This is insane.

1992
01:28:38,365 --> 01:28:41,666
(They will deliver their feelings for the first time since moving in.)

1993
01:28:42,306 --> 01:28:44,136
Everyone.

1994
01:28:44,676 --> 01:28:46,575
People on the second floor.

1995
01:28:46,775 --> 01:28:49,046
- Did you read the message? - You have a message.

1996
01:28:58,115 --> 01:28:59,985
Let's clink our glasses after sending the message.

1997
01:29:01,286 --> 01:29:02,626
- This is unbelievable. - This is insane.

1998
01:29:03,086 --> 01:29:04,225
Okay.

1999
01:29:11,195 --> 01:29:12,265
Seriously,

2000
01:29:14,136 --> 01:29:16,405
every message is precious.

2001
01:29:17,735 --> 01:29:20,945
We can't message each other at other times.

2002
01:29:22,706 --> 01:29:25,746
So I gave it a lot of thought to make a decision carefully.

2003
01:29:29,086 --> 01:29:31,855
I didn't hesitate.

2004
01:29:34,086 --> 01:29:35,685
The mirror isn't reflecting the screen, is it?

2005
01:29:36,286 --> 01:29:37,355
(Turning around)

2006
01:29:42,466 --> 01:29:43,996
This is so hard.

2007
01:29:44,065 --> 01:29:45,395
- Did you send it? - No.

2008
01:29:47,806 --> 01:29:50,806
Choosing what to say was much harder...

2009
01:29:51,176 --> 01:29:52,605
than I expected.

2010
01:29:53,746 --> 01:29:55,975
I didn't want to make it so obvious.

2011
01:30:17,435 --> 01:30:19,395
(They finished delivering their feelings.)

2012
01:30:19,666 --> 01:30:21,764
- Cheers. You did well today. - Cheers.

2013
01:30:21,765 --> 01:30:23,064
- Thank you for your hard work. - Thank you for your hard work.

2014
01:30:23,065 --> 01:30:26,605
- Thank you for your hard work. - You did well today.

2015
01:30:27,445 --> 01:30:30,105
You wanted to drink wine today.

2016
01:30:30,176 --> 01:30:31,444
It's too bad that you can't drink.

2017
01:30:31,445 --> 01:30:32,745
- I can't drink. - Seriously.

2018
01:30:32,746 --> 01:30:33,815
I took medicine.

2019
01:30:34,645 --> 01:30:37,014
- Did Cheol Hyeon make this drink? - It's so tasty.

2020
01:30:37,015 --> 01:30:38,215
- It's so tasty. - Really?

2021
01:30:38,216 --> 01:30:39,684
- Is the ratio okay? - It's so tasty.

2022
01:30:39,685 --> 01:30:41,724
- I made it weak. - It's really tasty.

2023
01:30:41,725 --> 01:30:44,325
- I was so surprised. - It chases away exhaustion.

2024
01:30:47,695 --> 01:30:48,765
- Goodness. - It's so tasty.

2025
01:30:49,025 --> 01:30:50,195
Is it good?

2026
01:30:50,865 --> 01:30:52,694
- Your reactions make me feel good. - You must try it.

2027
01:30:52,695 --> 01:30:53,806
Seriously.

2028
01:30:54,405 --> 01:30:56,006
Brother-in-law.

2029
01:30:57,636 --> 01:30:58,904
It's nice to see them together.

2030
01:30:58,905 --> 01:31:00,445
- The brother-in-law hunter. - There is warmth in his eyes.

2031
01:31:02,275 --> 01:31:05,115
- What do you think? Is it good? - It's tasty.

2032
01:31:06,676 --> 01:31:08,415
- Is my face red? - Your face is okay so far.

2033
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:09,416
- Really? - It's okay so far.

2034
01:31:14,256 --> 01:31:21,195
(I had fun today thanks to you. Let's keep having fun together.)

2035
01:31:22,365 --> 01:31:25,596
(Who do you think sent the message?)

2036
01:31:25,836 --> 01:31:27,666
I don't have a clue.

2037
01:31:30,706 --> 01:31:32,006
That day,

2038
01:31:33,405 --> 01:31:35,046
I interacted with Yun Ha and Se Seung...

2039
01:31:35,706 --> 01:31:38,615
in equal amounts.

2040
01:31:43,015 --> 01:31:45,155
I sent a message to Yong Woo.

2041
01:31:46,386 --> 01:31:49,456
We shopped for groceries...

2042
01:31:49,825 --> 01:31:51,394
and went bowling together.

2043
01:31:51,395 --> 01:31:53,524
His looks are...

2044
01:31:53,525 --> 01:31:55,595
very handsome.

2045
01:31:55,596 --> 01:31:58,734
And his personality is easy-going...

2046
01:31:58,735 --> 01:32:00,235
and refreshing.

2047
01:32:00,336 --> 01:32:03,065
I found those aspects charming.

2048
01:32:06,206 --> 01:32:08,405
I was happy to receive that message.

2049
01:32:09,046 --> 01:32:11,176
It comes out very well.

2050
01:32:13,075 --> 01:32:14,246
How pretty.

2051
01:32:14,386 --> 01:32:15,484
(One person chose your sibling.)

2052
01:32:15,485 --> 01:32:17,086
- My goodness. - Seriously.

2053
01:32:22,786 --> 01:32:24,895
It felt strange.

2054
01:32:26,426 --> 01:32:27,925
(They get to know how many messages their siblings received.)

2055
01:32:27,926 --> 01:32:29,166
I didn't see it coming.

2056
01:32:29,565 --> 01:32:31,636
I didn't see it coming. It was a bit shocking.

2057
01:32:31,836 --> 01:32:34,336
I didn't expect such a message.

2058
01:32:35,206 --> 01:32:36,536
Do they get that information?

2059
01:32:37,306 --> 01:32:40,105
They get notified when their siblings get a message.

2060
01:32:40,605 --> 01:32:41,774
- Do they tell them? - Do they tell them?

2061
01:32:41,775 --> 01:32:43,376
They tell the siblings too.

2062
01:32:45,346 --> 01:32:46,985
There shouldn't be any secrets between the family members.

2063
01:32:47,985 --> 01:32:49,645
There shouldn't be any secrets.

2064
01:32:50,886 --> 01:32:52,886
(Who chose my sibling?)

2065
01:32:53,515 --> 01:32:55,724
I thought he would get one or more messages.

2066
01:32:55,725 --> 01:32:57,296
When I saw that he received one message,

2067
01:32:57,456 --> 01:33:00,126
I thought, "Who could it be? It must be Cho A."

2068
01:33:00,525 --> 01:33:03,426
They seemed to have a strong connection.

2069
01:33:03,765 --> 01:33:05,796
I thought there was something...

2070
01:33:05,966 --> 01:33:08,405
between my brother and Cho A.

2071
01:33:08,565 --> 01:33:10,806
So I thought it was Cho A.

2072
01:33:11,706 --> 01:33:13,375
Do you want another drink?

2073
01:33:13,376 --> 01:33:15,545
- I will give you more. - It's so tasty.

2074
01:33:15,546 --> 01:33:17,945
- It's tasty. I drank it so quickly. - I drank it quickly too.

2075
01:33:21,546 --> 01:33:22,886
- Two messages? - Two messages?

2076
01:33:23,416 --> 01:33:24,886
Cho A and...

2077
01:33:25,286 --> 01:33:26,956
- Cho A. - Se Seung.

2078
01:33:30,926 --> 01:33:32,354
(Thank you for cooking!)

2079
01:33:32,355 --> 01:33:39,265
(Let's go and eat something tasty!)

2080
01:33:39,865 --> 01:33:41,405
One message read, "Thank you for cooking!"

2081
01:33:42,006 --> 01:33:44,575
The other message read, "Let's go and eat something tasty!"

2082
01:33:45,235 --> 01:33:46,336
Those were the messages.

2083
01:33:46,536 --> 01:33:49,846
I knew who sent "Thank you for cooking."

2084
01:33:50,176 --> 01:33:52,775
I cooked for Cho A.

2085
01:33:53,786 --> 01:33:56,315
Jung Sub was the one who came to mind first.

2086
01:33:57,086 --> 01:34:00,286
Jung Sub made me an egg dish.

2087
01:34:00,586 --> 01:34:02,525
I was incredibly hungry.

2088
01:34:03,895 --> 01:34:05,324
Did you make it yourself?

2089
01:34:05,325 --> 01:34:07,724
What? It's nothing, really.

2090
01:34:07,725 --> 01:34:09,096
I think I did a terrible job.

2091
01:34:09,825 --> 01:34:12,194
I just made this.

2092
01:34:12,195 --> 01:34:13,695
(Jung Sub made an egg dish for Cho A.)

2093
01:34:16,235 --> 01:34:20,306
I was touched that someone cooked for me.

2094
01:34:20,506 --> 01:34:21,846
It was nice.

2095
01:34:23,346 --> 01:34:24,875
That's right. You need to do something for the other.

2096
01:34:24,876 --> 01:34:26,644
Yong Woo hasn't done anything.

2097
01:34:26,645 --> 01:34:28,314
- No, he hasn't. You are right. - He hasn't made an impression.

2098
01:34:28,315 --> 01:34:30,144
- You need to take action. - That's right.

2099
01:34:30,145 --> 01:34:31,654
You don't get many points for playing basketball.

2100
01:34:31,655 --> 01:34:34,385
- Seriously. - She didn't even get to see it.

2101
01:34:34,386 --> 01:34:36,024
You need to show your sincerity.

2102
01:34:36,025 --> 01:34:37,295
(Let's go and eat something tasty!)

2103
01:34:37,296 --> 01:34:39,695
(Jung Sub received another message.)

2104
01:34:40,155 --> 01:34:41,596
"Let's go and eat something tasty?"

2105
01:34:42,325 --> 01:34:43,525
It was impossible...

2106
01:34:44,336 --> 01:34:47,036
to figure out the sender.

2107
01:34:47,806 --> 01:34:49,806
Who is this person?

2108
01:34:50,575 --> 01:34:52,275
I really have no idea.

2109
01:34:55,275 --> 01:34:58,176
(Another person who sent Jung Sub a message)

2110
01:34:59,615 --> 01:35:02,615
I talked to Jung Sub a lot today.

2111
01:35:02,685 --> 01:35:04,955
It was a lot of fun.

2112
01:35:04,956 --> 01:35:06,286
We have some things in common.

2113
01:35:06,815 --> 01:35:09,685
At first, I wrote a message that made my identity obvious.

2114
01:35:09,886 --> 01:35:11,225
Then I erased it.

2115
01:35:13,355 --> 01:35:15,996
I sent a generic message instead.

2116
01:35:19,536 --> 01:35:22,335
He said he valued conversations...

2117
01:35:22,336 --> 01:35:24,036
in relationship.

2118
01:35:24,735 --> 01:35:26,376
I really want to go on a date with him.

2119
01:35:26,475 --> 01:35:28,775
I want to see what he will be like when we are alone.

2120
01:35:28,905 --> 01:35:31,514
(Which message made you more curious?)

2121
01:35:31,515 --> 01:35:35,346
"Thank you for cooking" made me happy,

2122
01:35:35,445 --> 01:35:38,886
but "Let's go and eat something tasty" made me curious.

2123
01:35:39,185 --> 01:35:41,285
"Thank you for cooking..."

2124
01:35:41,286 --> 01:35:42,824
seemed a bit dry...

2125
01:35:42,825 --> 01:35:44,195
in my opinion.

2126
01:35:44,796 --> 01:35:46,596
So the message...

2127
01:35:46,996 --> 01:35:50,735
that looked forward to spending time with me in the future...

2128
01:35:51,365 --> 01:35:56,135
made me more curious on the subconscious level.

2129
01:35:56,136 --> 01:35:58,975
- Why? I don't understand. - How strange. I don't understand.

2130
01:35:59,206 --> 01:36:00,604
Isn't it more touching?

2131
01:36:00,605 --> 01:36:02,274
- Seriously. - By thanking him for cooking,

2132
01:36:02,275 --> 01:36:04,175
she revealed her identity.

2133
01:36:04,176 --> 01:36:06,944
I would be happy since she returned the favor.

2134
01:36:06,945 --> 01:36:08,984
- He thought it sounded dry... - He thought it sounded dry.

2135
01:36:08,985 --> 01:36:10,215
- for some reason. - Perhaps...

2136
01:36:10,216 --> 01:36:12,985
he thought she was thanking him just to be polite.

2137
01:36:13,056 --> 01:36:15,854
I think it's a matter of taste. People who are straightforward...

2138
01:36:15,855 --> 01:36:18,055
might prefer "Thank you for cooking."

2139
01:36:18,056 --> 01:36:20,224
But people who like being curious...

2140
01:36:20,225 --> 01:36:21,995
- and mystery... - I think that's the case.

2141
01:36:21,996 --> 01:36:23,796
- might prefer that message. - I think he likes the mystery.

2142
01:36:23,966 --> 01:36:25,335
That might be the case.

2143
01:36:25,336 --> 01:36:28,465
But a response that makes sense is, "I liked both messages."

2144
01:36:28,466 --> 01:36:31,234
I don't know why he said "It seemed a bit dry."

2145
01:36:31,235 --> 01:36:32,934
I guess it was too weak for him.

2146
01:36:32,935 --> 01:36:34,746
Did he want more validation?

2147
01:36:36,105 --> 01:36:39,145
In that sense, Se Seung made a smart move.

2148
01:36:39,416 --> 01:36:41,086
She made him curious.

2149
01:36:41,445 --> 01:36:43,085
- I know. - He became intrigued.

2150
01:36:43,086 --> 01:36:45,556
I don't like being curious.

2151
01:36:45,615 --> 01:36:46,654
- Me neither. - I can't stand it.

2152
01:36:46,655 --> 01:36:48,324
I like it when things are certain.

2153
01:36:48,325 --> 01:36:50,625
When the curiosity grows...

2154
01:36:50,626 --> 01:36:52,654
In dating, curiosity isn't needed.

2155
01:36:52,655 --> 01:36:54,194
- Things should be certain. - Is that so?

2156
01:36:54,195 --> 01:36:55,195
Yes.

2157
01:36:58,296 --> 01:37:00,604
- You should learn from her. - You should learn from her.

2158
01:37:00,605 --> 01:37:02,905
- You should learn from her. - Hurry up and open the book.

2159
01:37:03,466 --> 01:37:04,605
They are so funny.

2160
01:37:05,605 --> 01:37:09,376
(Jung Sub received a message from Se Seung and Cho A.)

2161
01:37:10,405 --> 01:37:15,246
(To whom did Jung Sub send a message?)

2162
01:37:18,855 --> 01:37:21,485
(Cho A receives a message.)

2163
01:37:23,456 --> 01:37:28,496
(One person chose your sibling.)

2164
01:37:29,825 --> 01:37:31,796
I thought...

2165
01:37:31,895 --> 01:37:36,235
the message was from Jung Sub.

2166
01:37:36,905 --> 01:37:38,275
While making scrambled eggs,

2167
01:37:38,376 --> 01:37:41,905
Jung Sub said, "I ruined it."

2168
01:37:42,176 --> 01:37:44,015
(Making an egg dish)

2169
01:37:44,615 --> 01:37:45,775
I ruined it.

2170
01:37:48,815 --> 01:37:50,185
I think it's pretty.

2171
01:37:52,056 --> 01:37:56,786
I think he wanted to make it well.

2172
01:37:57,155 --> 01:37:58,825
I had that thought.

2173
01:38:02,325 --> 01:38:05,235
(Se Seung receives a message.)

2174
01:38:06,636 --> 01:38:12,505
(You were good at bowling. Thank you for playing diligently.)

2175
01:38:12,506 --> 01:38:15,104
"You were good at bowling."

2176
01:38:15,105 --> 01:38:17,876
Had the message stopped there, I wouldn't have known who it was.

2177
01:38:18,645 --> 01:38:20,615
"Thank you for playing diligently."

2178
01:38:20,945 --> 01:38:22,346
That means he was on my team.

2179
01:38:26,916 --> 01:38:28,485
I sent a message to Se Seung.

2180
01:38:30,825 --> 01:38:33,955
I got to spend a lot of time with Se Seung.

2181
01:38:33,956 --> 01:38:34,996
It made me think,

2182
01:38:35,025 --> 01:38:38,765
"The time you spend with someone is very important."

2183
01:38:39,265 --> 01:38:42,806
When we went bowling, he was like a teacher.

2184
01:38:43,636 --> 01:38:45,105
- You are right-handed, right? - Yes.

2185
01:38:45,575 --> 01:38:48,105
Imagine that it's stuck on your hand. Move it like this.

2186
01:38:48,405 --> 01:38:50,675
I couldn't help...

2187
01:38:50,676 --> 01:38:52,876
but see Se Seung in a better light.

2188
01:38:53,376 --> 01:38:55,815
That's good. You did so well.

2189
01:38:58,655 --> 01:39:01,926
We listened to my instructions and followed them diligently,

2190
01:39:02,325 --> 01:39:03,756
so I was very thankful.

2191
01:39:03,956 --> 01:39:07,296
I wanted to convey that feeling.

2192
01:39:08,666 --> 01:39:12,735
(Se Seung and Jung Sub sent each other a message.)

2193
01:39:13,395 --> 01:39:16,105
(And Cho A receives a message.)

2194
01:39:16,706 --> 01:39:18,805
(Had we bowled together, I would have won.)

2195
01:39:18,806 --> 01:39:20,876
(Let's play together next time.)

2196
01:39:20,975 --> 01:39:22,376
"Had we bowled together..."

2197
01:39:22,605 --> 01:39:25,475
- It's Yong Woo. - How touching.

2198
01:39:25,716 --> 01:39:28,015
It's Yong Woo's message.

2199
01:39:28,685 --> 01:39:30,386
He sent it well.

2200
01:39:31,985 --> 01:39:35,025
I think it's a message from Yong Woo.

2201
01:39:35,786 --> 01:39:37,525
The message read,

2202
01:39:37,626 --> 01:39:40,724
"Had we bowled together, I would have won."

2203
01:39:40,725 --> 01:39:43,694
So I realized that it was from someone...

2204
01:39:43,695 --> 01:39:45,836
who had lost.

2205
01:39:47,036 --> 01:39:49,806
I think the day passed quickly today.

2206
01:39:49,905 --> 01:39:50,905
- Same here. - Right?

2207
01:39:50,906 --> 01:39:52,335
Perhaps it was because we had many activities.

2208
01:39:52,336 --> 01:39:54,275
- That's right. - Cho A, you must be tired...

2209
01:39:54,575 --> 01:39:55,645
from working.

2210
01:39:56,246 --> 01:39:59,944
- We just went to places. - That's right.

2211
01:39:59,945 --> 01:40:01,814
- It must have been fun. - That's right.

2212
01:40:01,815 --> 01:40:03,785
We exercised outside for a long time.

2213
01:40:03,786 --> 01:40:05,215
- That's right. - A long time.

2214
01:40:05,216 --> 01:40:07,086
- About an hour. - It was fun.

2215
01:40:07,216 --> 01:40:09,824
He consoled me regarding the activities...

2216
01:40:09,825 --> 01:40:11,126
I couldn't join...

2217
01:40:11,556 --> 01:40:13,525
and asked me to participate next time.

2218
01:40:13,695 --> 01:40:15,626
It was...

2219
01:40:16,195 --> 01:40:17,296
very touching.

2220
01:40:17,865 --> 01:40:19,996
If my words...

2221
01:40:20,136 --> 01:40:22,934
made her feel like she shared a warm day...

2222
01:40:22,935 --> 01:40:24,775
with us,

2223
01:40:25,475 --> 01:40:28,605
it would be a good message.

2224
01:40:31,416 --> 01:40:34,514
- I can't believe it. - I feel hot.

2225
01:40:34,515 --> 01:40:37,985
- Hold on. - I can't believe it.

2226
01:40:38,185 --> 01:40:39,286
Why are you hitting him?

2227
01:40:40,825 --> 01:40:42,126
Why are you hitting me?

2228
01:40:42,655 --> 01:40:44,056
I was so happy.

2229
01:40:44,725 --> 01:40:47,055
He said those words without sounding oily.

2230
01:40:47,056 --> 01:40:48,194
- We need to learn from him. - I know.

2231
01:40:48,195 --> 01:40:50,125
Such comments can sound incredibly corny.

2232
01:40:50,126 --> 01:40:51,536
Gosh, Yong Woo.

2233
01:41:03,376 --> 01:41:09,246
(Two people chose your sibling.)

2234
01:41:17,796 --> 01:41:19,626
When I received that message,

2235
01:41:20,655 --> 01:41:21,865
it wasn't easy...

2236
01:41:22,265 --> 01:41:26,265
to suppress the smile of a big brother.

2237
01:41:26,966 --> 01:41:30,166
Is it possible that the messages were delivered...

2238
01:41:31,275 --> 01:41:32,935
to the wrong person?

2239
01:41:37,046 --> 01:41:38,346
It's fascinating.

2240
01:41:46,855 --> 01:41:48,425
(Someone ate my banana I kept in the fridge for breakfast.)

2241
01:41:48,426 --> 01:41:55,325
(You looked cute while bowling.)

2242
01:41:57,565 --> 01:42:00,065
I never thought that I would receive two messages.

2243
01:42:00,235 --> 01:42:03,336
I couldn't tell who the senders were.

2244
01:42:04,506 --> 01:42:07,806
I think Cheol Hyeon is one of them.

2245
01:42:10,105 --> 01:42:11,876
I sent a message to Ju Yeon.

2246
01:42:12,676 --> 01:42:15,415
I talked to Ju Yeon the most.

2247
01:42:15,416 --> 01:42:17,285
We had a proper conversation...

2248
01:42:17,286 --> 01:42:19,185
while looking at each other in the eyes.

2249
01:42:20,416 --> 01:42:22,255
You don't eat meat at all?

2250
01:42:22,256 --> 01:42:25,854
No. When I meet up with other people...

2251
01:42:25,855 --> 01:42:27,524
There are many people like you around me.

2252
01:42:27,525 --> 01:42:29,225
- Really? I am jealous. - Yes.

2253
01:42:29,325 --> 01:42:33,065
I want to get to know Ju Yeon.

2254
01:42:33,395 --> 01:42:35,364
I had that thought.

2255
01:42:35,365 --> 01:42:38,105
(Cheol Hyeon sent Ju Yeon a message since he wanted to get to know her.)

2256
01:42:42,905 --> 01:42:45,644
(It was nice to talk to you a lot today.)

2257
01:42:45,645 --> 01:42:49,484
(Let's get to know each other with the calm vibe.)

2258
01:42:49,485 --> 01:42:51,055
I got a hunch.

2259
01:42:51,056 --> 01:42:53,015
I thought, "I know who sent this message."

2260
01:42:54,155 --> 01:42:55,225
Ju Yeon.

2261
01:42:56,286 --> 01:42:59,126
I liked Cheol Hyeon from the first impression.

2262
01:42:59,225 --> 01:43:02,625
I wanted to have my first date with him,

2263
01:43:02,626 --> 01:43:04,765
so I sent him a message.

2264
01:43:05,466 --> 01:43:09,865
(One person chose your sibling.)

2265
01:43:10,536 --> 01:43:15,105
(Cheol Hyeon and Ju Yeon sent each other a message.)

2266
01:43:15,405 --> 01:43:17,615
As for the other message,

2267
01:43:17,746 --> 01:43:22,185
I have no idea who sent it.

2268
01:43:24,115 --> 01:43:26,556
I sent Ju Yeon a message.

2269
01:43:26,985 --> 01:43:28,154
(Jae Hyung was the other sender.)

2270
01:43:28,155 --> 01:43:30,655
I was on the same team as her.

2271
01:43:31,525 --> 01:43:33,855
I didn't do anything other than bowling.

2272
01:43:34,496 --> 01:43:36,926
(He messaged someone he spent a short time, Ju Yeon.)

2273
01:43:37,325 --> 01:43:42,006
I struggled so much on the 1st and 2nd day.

2274
01:43:42,065 --> 01:43:44,935
Since I had hurt my hand,

2275
01:43:45,575 --> 01:43:49,206
I couldn't focus on anything else.

2276
01:43:58,416 --> 01:44:05,296
(One person chose your sibling.)

2277
01:44:07,996 --> 01:44:10,065
I thought she would get one message at the very least.

2278
01:44:13,235 --> 01:44:15,466
"I guess she adjusted well."

2279
01:44:15,836 --> 01:44:17,006
I had that thought.

2280
01:44:21,605 --> 01:44:26,916
(Even after a wait, he doesn't get a message.)

2281
01:44:31,386 --> 01:44:32,985
(Se Seung receives a message.)

2282
01:44:33,756 --> 01:44:38,355
(No one chose your sibling.)

2283
01:44:40,655 --> 01:44:42,264
That makes my heart ache.

2284
01:44:42,265 --> 01:44:43,596
- That's painful. - Do they send that as well?

2285
01:44:44,065 --> 01:44:46,064
That would make my heart ache.

2286
01:44:46,065 --> 01:44:47,904
That would really make my heart ache.

2287
01:44:47,905 --> 01:44:49,506
At first, she was like,

2288
01:44:49,806 --> 01:44:51,604
"No one chose him."

2289
01:44:51,605 --> 01:44:53,535
- Now, things are serious. - Today, she is like, "What?"

2290
01:44:53,536 --> 01:44:56,574
On the first day, they didn't choose as they wanted.

2291
01:44:56,575 --> 01:44:59,345
- They had to guess. - That's right.

2292
01:44:59,346 --> 01:45:02,586
(No one chose your sibling.)

2293
01:45:02,786 --> 01:45:06,216
It hit me hard.

2294
01:45:07,756 --> 01:45:09,185
Mr. Zero Votes.

2295
01:45:10,225 --> 01:45:12,096
That's who he is. Mr. Zero Votes.

2296
01:45:14,355 --> 01:45:16,764
If he hadn't gotten hurt,

2297
01:45:16,765 --> 01:45:19,735
I would have just said, "He must be disappointed."

2298
01:45:20,096 --> 01:45:21,404
But my brother got hurt.

2299
01:45:21,405 --> 01:45:23,904
He seemed to be in a bad condition when he came back.

2300
01:45:23,905 --> 01:45:26,206
Then I received that text.

2301
01:45:26,475 --> 01:45:30,074
"You were good at bowling" no longer made me...

2302
01:45:30,075 --> 01:45:31,676
happy.

2303
01:45:33,275 --> 01:45:35,745
I felt disheartened...

2304
01:45:35,746 --> 01:45:37,286
very suddenly.

2305
01:45:38,155 --> 01:45:42,825
(Her brother received 0 votes.)

2306
01:45:44,825 --> 01:45:46,556
I bet my sister was worried.

2307
01:45:48,466 --> 01:45:50,224
Before moving into the house,

2308
01:45:50,225 --> 01:45:51,996
I didn't think I would worry about my brother.

2309
01:45:52,496 --> 01:45:54,605
I guess that's what it means to be blood-related.

2310
01:45:54,706 --> 01:45:57,905
I couldn't help but worry about my brother that day.

2311
01:46:01,706 --> 01:46:03,405
Is there a foam roller? Did someone bring it?

2312
01:46:04,075 --> 01:46:05,774
I saw a foam roller.

2313
01:46:05,775 --> 01:46:07,046
I brought it.

2314
01:46:07,615 --> 01:46:09,145
- If you want to use it... Yes. - Did you bring a foam roller?

2315
01:46:09,416 --> 01:46:11,555
Aren't you a drifter?

2316
01:46:11,556 --> 01:46:13,114
A drifter.

2317
01:46:13,115 --> 01:46:14,824
- I bet you had a lot of baggage. - I brought the entire house.

2318
01:46:14,825 --> 01:46:16,025
I know. I bet you had a lot of baggage.

2319
01:46:16,355 --> 01:46:17,925
- There are things I don't have. - She is like a mom.

2320
01:46:17,926 --> 01:46:19,496
Madecassol and Fucidin ointments.

2321
01:46:19,756 --> 01:46:21,596
You also didn't bring scissors.

2322
01:46:21,825 --> 01:46:22,825
That's right.

2323
01:46:23,126 --> 01:46:24,665
- We bought scissors earlier. - I am sorry.

2324
01:46:24,666 --> 01:46:27,035
- We have scissors in the house. - We will find a pair.

2325
01:46:27,036 --> 01:46:28,036
I am sorry.

2326
01:46:29,265 --> 01:46:30,405
You made a big mistake.

2327
01:46:30,706 --> 01:46:31,775
You should have brought scissors.

2328
01:46:31,876 --> 01:46:33,235
You should have brought scissors.

2329
01:46:34,176 --> 01:46:35,905
You have a really nice voice.

2330
01:46:37,815 --> 01:46:39,774
- That was sudden. - I thought he was an actor.

2331
01:46:39,775 --> 01:46:41,546
- An actor. - He might be a voice actor.

2332
01:46:42,445 --> 01:46:43,445
That might be the case.

2333
01:46:44,086 --> 01:46:46,155
He can make a variety of voices.

2334
01:46:55,496 --> 01:47:02,405
(No one chose your sibling.)

2335
01:47:34,735 --> 01:47:36,536
He suddenly became downcast.

2336
01:47:37,565 --> 01:47:39,934
- Oh, no. - He must be very worried.

2337
01:47:39,935 --> 01:47:41,505
- I bet he would prefer... - He is worried.

2338
01:47:41,506 --> 01:47:42,574
- not getting any votes himself. - He is worried.

2339
01:47:42,575 --> 01:47:43,775
He must be a bit annoyed.

2340
01:47:47,815 --> 01:47:49,445
It made my heart ache a lot.

2341
01:47:50,115 --> 01:47:53,184
Also, I felt a bit annoyed...

2342
01:47:53,185 --> 01:47:55,586
with other male participants.

2343
01:47:56,725 --> 01:47:57,926
"What's wrong with my sibling?"

2344
01:47:58,895 --> 01:48:00,695
"What's wrong with my sibling?"

2345
01:48:01,525 --> 01:48:02,596
"She is pretty."

2346
01:48:04,025 --> 01:48:05,336
I had that thought.

2347
01:48:05,695 --> 01:48:08,636
(Jung Sub can't laugh with the others.)

2348
01:48:13,775 --> 01:48:17,945
I studied my sibling's face when I received the message.

2349
01:48:18,846 --> 01:48:22,315
She looked quite dejected,

2350
01:48:22,416 --> 01:48:23,985
so I was very worried.

2351
01:48:27,315 --> 01:48:30,886
(He becomes pensive upon receiving the message about his sibling.)

2352
01:48:35,325 --> 01:48:36,395
What are you doing?

2353
01:48:37,395 --> 01:48:39,995
I was thinking about a way to mix up the drinks.

2354
01:48:39,996 --> 01:48:41,166
- These drinks? - Yes.

2355
01:48:53,115 --> 01:48:55,845
(During the preliminary interview)

2356
01:48:55,846 --> 01:48:57,786
Which one do you think would be more popular?

2357
01:48:58,515 --> 01:49:00,155
I think my sister would be more popular.

2358
01:49:00,586 --> 01:49:02,185
- Wouldn't you be more popular? - No,

2359
01:49:02,325 --> 01:49:03,355
I don't think that would be the case.

2360
01:49:04,025 --> 01:49:06,296
My older sister has always had...

2361
01:49:06,996 --> 01:49:09,096
more people express their interests.

2362
01:49:09,265 --> 01:49:10,296
Gosh.

2363
01:49:10,596 --> 01:49:11,836
- Is she his older sister? - She is his older sister.

2364
01:49:12,195 --> 01:49:13,235
Really?

2365
01:49:13,496 --> 01:49:14,864
Is she older? I thought he was older.

2366
01:49:14,865 --> 01:49:16,006
I thought he was older.

2367
01:49:16,306 --> 01:49:18,235
Between you being popular and your older sister being popular,

2368
01:49:18,876 --> 01:49:20,105
which one would you prefer?

2369
01:49:20,235 --> 01:49:22,006
I would much prefer to be unpopular...

2370
01:49:22,206 --> 01:49:23,376
and my sister is popular.

2371
01:49:24,145 --> 01:49:25,176
- Why? - Why?

2372
01:49:25,575 --> 01:49:26,716
I just want...

2373
01:49:29,086 --> 01:49:31,286
things to go well for my sister.

2374
01:49:32,015 --> 01:49:34,415
When he learned that she had received zero votes,

2375
01:49:34,416 --> 01:49:36,925
- he was ready to fight someone. - Seriously.

2376
01:49:36,926 --> 01:49:38,155
- He looked very upset. - Yes.

2377
01:49:38,655 --> 01:49:40,996
If my sister is popular, I will be happy.

2378
01:49:41,765 --> 01:49:43,195
Even if you keep getting zero votes?

2379
01:49:43,996 --> 01:49:45,836
Yes. That doesn't matter.

2380
01:49:47,666 --> 01:49:51,575
(Jung Sub worries about her and roots for her with sincerity.)

2381
01:49:52,506 --> 01:49:57,105
(Who could be Jung Sub's sibling?)

2382
01:50:11,155 --> 01:50:12,654
(Jung Sub's sibling)

2383
01:50:12,655 --> 01:50:13,655
Hi.

2384
01:50:13,656 --> 01:50:15,596
(Jung Sub's sibling)

2385
01:50:15,695 --> 01:50:20,435
(Lee Yun Ha)

2386
01:50:21,966 --> 01:50:23,265
Yun Ha.

2387
01:50:25,506 --> 01:50:27,336
- They look alike. - They are smiling.

2388
01:50:29,746 --> 01:50:30,845
Are you doing okay?

2389
01:50:30,846 --> 01:50:31,846
How about you?

2390
01:50:32,275 --> 01:50:33,416
Are you doing okay?

2391
01:50:33,876 --> 01:50:37,246
Seriously, I missed you so much.

2392
01:50:38,655 --> 01:50:39,955
Is it okay to cry?

2393
01:50:39,956 --> 01:50:41,725
Yes. Seriously. Earlier...

2394
01:50:45,695 --> 01:50:47,096
Seriously.

2395
01:50:48,596 --> 01:50:50,995
Gosh, he becomes a different person...

2396
01:50:50,996 --> 01:50:52,764
- in front of his older sister. - You are right.

2397
01:50:52,765 --> 01:50:54,435
- He becomes cute. - Yes.

2398
01:50:54,735 --> 01:50:57,006
I am seeing Jung Sub in a different light.

2399
01:50:57,166 --> 01:50:59,806
- Why is he so lovely? - It's a new side of him.

2400
01:51:02,405 --> 01:51:03,475
What?

2401
01:51:03,806 --> 01:51:05,245
You look pretty.

2402
01:51:05,246 --> 01:51:07,216
(These siblings are unbelievably close.)

2403
01:51:09,246 --> 01:51:11,184
There is a big age gap between us,

2404
01:51:11,185 --> 01:51:12,556
so we rarely fight.

2405
01:51:13,386 --> 01:51:14,955
- What? - A big age gap?

2406
01:51:14,956 --> 01:51:16,955
- Is there a big age gap? - Is there a big age gap?

2407
01:51:16,956 --> 01:51:19,455
Are they like Yong Woo and Ju Yeon?

2408
01:51:19,456 --> 01:51:20,956
I think so.

2409
01:51:21,056 --> 01:51:22,996
She was born in December.

2410
01:51:23,225 --> 01:51:24,995
In elementary school,

2411
01:51:24,996 --> 01:51:26,795
she was the tiniest and palest in her class.

2412
01:51:26,796 --> 01:51:28,805
Sitting there smiling with her eyes, she looked the most like a baby.

2413
01:51:28,806 --> 01:51:29,905
She was like that.

2414
01:51:31,676 --> 01:51:34,206
(She always smiled with her eyes.)

2415
01:51:36,746 --> 01:51:38,345
- How cute. - She had a pretty smile.

2416
01:51:38,346 --> 01:51:39,346
Her eyes look the same now...

2417
01:51:39,346 --> 01:51:40,346
- when she smiles. - How cute.

2418
01:51:40,445 --> 01:51:41,585
My goodness.

2419
01:51:41,586 --> 01:51:43,386
So it's possible to smile like that in childhood.

2420
01:51:44,086 --> 01:51:47,115
- Is it fun? You should answer. - Yes.

2421
01:51:51,355 --> 01:51:52,355
Mom.

2422
01:51:53,056 --> 01:51:55,965
A butterfly is flying.

2423
01:51:55,966 --> 01:51:56,966
Okay.

2424
01:51:56,967 --> 01:51:57,996
I saw one.

2425
01:51:58,735 --> 01:52:00,536
When she was little, it was my dream...

2426
01:52:01,435 --> 01:52:03,966
to have her play the violin while I played the cello.

2427
01:52:04,265 --> 01:52:07,105
It was my dream to live the rest of my life that way.

2428
01:52:09,945 --> 01:52:12,645
So Yun Ha was learning the violin.

2429
01:52:13,115 --> 01:52:14,176
One day, she went,

2430
01:52:14,416 --> 01:52:16,485
"Why are you sitting down when I am standing up?"

2431
01:52:17,115 --> 01:52:18,756
"I want to play the cello."

2432
01:52:21,556 --> 01:52:23,625
I was her practice instructor.

2433
01:52:23,626 --> 01:52:24,786
What's this?

2434
01:52:25,626 --> 01:52:27,725
- Mi, sol in C major. - C major?

2435
01:52:28,796 --> 01:52:29,895
A lot of flats.

2436
01:52:30,225 --> 01:52:31,296
Stretch it out.

2437
01:52:32,065 --> 01:52:33,096
Stretch it out.

2438
01:52:33,365 --> 01:52:35,836
Make it sing. Vibrato.

2439
01:52:40,036 --> 01:52:43,546
She began playing the cello as she wanted...

2440
01:52:43,975 --> 01:52:45,145
and won the Grand Award.

2441
01:52:51,286 --> 01:52:52,654
When she studied abroad,

2442
01:52:52,655 --> 01:52:53,814
I told her that she could only go...

2443
01:52:53,815 --> 01:52:55,985
to Yale University on a full scholarship.

2444
01:52:56,725 --> 01:52:58,895
She went to the auditions in the US alone.

2445
01:52:59,126 --> 01:53:01,125
She booked the bus tickets...

2446
01:53:01,126 --> 01:53:03,596
and visited many universities to audition.

2447
01:53:03,695 --> 01:53:06,166
She received a housing scholarship and graduated from a university.

2448
01:53:07,796 --> 01:53:11,806
She is a very independent and nice daughter.

2449
01:53:24,046 --> 01:53:25,456
- She suddenly looks so cool. - How cool.

2450
01:53:25,556 --> 01:53:27,014
- She looks so different. - She is beautiful.

2451
01:53:27,015 --> 01:53:29,126
And a big sister like her received zero votes.

2452
01:53:29,485 --> 01:53:30,485
I know.

2453
01:53:30,586 --> 01:53:31,894
She should wake up early in the morning...

2454
01:53:31,895 --> 01:53:33,126
and play the cello in the front yard.

2455
01:53:33,626 --> 01:53:34,796
- She should do this. - Yes.

2456
01:53:35,796 --> 01:53:37,125
- In the front yard... - Yong Woo can do this by her side.

2457
01:53:37,126 --> 01:53:38,864
While she plays the cello, Yong Woo can play basketball.

2458
01:53:38,865 --> 01:53:40,694
(The morning cello and basketball performance)

2459
01:53:40,695 --> 01:53:41,765
They should show off their specialties.

2460
01:53:42,306 --> 01:53:46,206
We actually thought about not having another kid after Yun Ha.

2461
01:53:46,605 --> 01:53:49,644
But my peers had the second kid.

2462
01:53:49,645 --> 01:53:51,445
We said, "Let's have a son."

2463
01:53:52,176 --> 01:53:54,015
So I read a book on the matter.

2464
01:53:54,376 --> 01:53:55,586
- That was how we had a son. - Yes.

2465
01:53:55,685 --> 01:53:58,854
He ate meat for a month or two.

2466
01:53:58,855 --> 01:54:00,085
I did it to make my body more acidic.

2467
01:54:00,086 --> 01:54:02,926
I only ate vegetables.

2468
01:54:03,286 --> 01:54:05,524
- I only ate vegetables. - There is such a method.

2469
01:54:05,525 --> 01:54:06,556
Then...

2470
01:54:07,155 --> 01:54:08,926
we practiced abstinence during that time.

2471
01:54:09,225 --> 01:54:10,225
Hold on.

2472
01:54:10,626 --> 01:54:12,835
Don't go into details.

2473
01:54:12,836 --> 01:54:14,166
Those are for private conversations.

2474
01:54:14,296 --> 01:54:15,636
We measured our temperature every day.

2475
01:54:16,006 --> 01:54:17,335
- We did it every day. - Every day.

2476
01:54:17,336 --> 01:54:19,376
There was a day when the temperature dropped.

2477
01:54:20,405 --> 01:54:22,475
- That was the day when... - Yes.

2478
01:54:23,006 --> 01:54:24,605
Thus, we had Jung Sub.

2479
01:54:26,615 --> 01:54:28,484
- Is it okay to say this on TV? - Is it okay?

2480
01:54:28,485 --> 01:54:30,346
Suit yourself.

2481
01:54:30,546 --> 01:54:31,716
We made him.

2482
01:54:32,416 --> 01:54:34,586
He is a robot. He is an AI.

2483
01:54:36,426 --> 01:54:38,086
Are you reading?

2484
01:54:43,996 --> 01:54:45,796
He looked the same.

2485
01:54:45,996 --> 01:54:46,996
He was so cute.

2486
01:54:47,496 --> 01:54:48,905
It's June 26.

2487
01:54:49,435 --> 01:54:52,336
I don't know if Jung Sub knows that today is his 100th day.

2488
01:55:04,515 --> 01:55:05,886
He only has eyes for his sister.

2489
01:55:15,096 --> 01:55:16,764
Since then, he has only had eyes for his sister.

2490
01:55:16,765 --> 01:55:17,796
I know.

2491
01:55:18,735 --> 01:55:21,235
- He was quite chubby. - Very chubby.

2492
01:55:22,435 --> 01:55:23,735
He rolled around this way and that way.

2493
01:55:23,905 --> 01:55:25,206
He looked like a panda.

2494
01:55:26,676 --> 01:55:27,905
A baby panda.

2495
01:55:34,046 --> 01:55:35,614
Jung Sub, you messed it up.

2496
01:55:35,615 --> 01:55:37,246
Gosh, how embarrassing.

2497
01:55:37,485 --> 01:55:38,716
Gosh, how embarrassing.

2498
01:55:39,586 --> 01:55:41,086
(Screaming)

2499
01:55:41,386 --> 01:55:44,126
Jung Sub, come on.

2500
01:55:48,195 --> 01:55:49,296
That's important.

2501
01:55:49,466 --> 01:55:51,735
I think it really matters.

2502
01:55:52,265 --> 01:55:53,666
That's the type of people I...

2503
01:55:54,296 --> 01:55:55,405
Desire.

2504
01:55:55,735 --> 01:55:57,865
I desire them.

2505
01:55:58,836 --> 01:56:00,175
Did you live abroad?

2506
01:56:00,176 --> 01:56:01,905
No, I am sorry.

2507
01:56:03,246 --> 01:56:04,876
You speak English pretty well.

2508
01:56:05,275 --> 01:56:06,846
He attended the English kindergarten.

2509
01:56:07,475 --> 01:56:09,085
- He received early education. - That's right.

2510
01:56:09,086 --> 01:56:10,086
English kindergarten.

2511
01:56:10,846 --> 01:56:12,416
- W. - W.

2512
01:56:12,655 --> 01:56:14,815
- X, Y. - X.

2513
01:56:15,626 --> 01:56:17,786
I am James.

2514
01:56:18,596 --> 01:56:21,295
He had a lot of talent ever since he was little.

2515
01:56:21,296 --> 01:56:23,165
Do you have a desire to make people laugh?

2516
01:56:23,166 --> 01:56:24,565
Of course, I do.

2517
01:56:25,636 --> 01:56:28,096
He was practicing a voice impression at home.

2518
01:56:29,036 --> 01:56:31,234
I didn't know what he was doing alone in his room.

2519
01:56:31,235 --> 01:56:33,206
I was like, "Hey, don't do that."

2520
01:56:34,105 --> 01:56:37,075
"Don't do something like that. You sound ridiculous."

2521
01:56:38,876 --> 01:56:40,876
I think Mom was younger than I am now in this picture.

2522
01:56:41,046 --> 01:56:43,614
Gosh, was she younger than you are now?

2523
01:56:43,615 --> 01:56:44,615
I think so.

2524
01:56:45,416 --> 01:56:46,885
(Her mom in the photo was younger than she is now.)

2525
01:56:46,886 --> 01:56:49,556
You entered the world when she was a bit older.

2526
01:56:50,325 --> 01:56:51,825
- Ta-da. - Ta-da.

2527
01:56:52,256 --> 01:56:54,895
- It's Mom's coat, right? - Yes, it's Mom's coat.

2528
01:56:56,096 --> 01:56:58,796
- Dad always sits like this. - And Mom does this.

2529
01:57:08,945 --> 01:57:10,746
One, two, three.

2530
01:57:14,046 --> 01:57:15,814
The previous one. I like this one.

2531
01:57:15,815 --> 01:57:18,115
- Only you look good. - Number three.

2532
01:57:18,456 --> 01:57:20,456
Next. My nostrils are as big as a coin.

2533
01:57:22,725 --> 01:57:24,724
(Lee Yun Ha)

2534
01:57:24,725 --> 01:57:26,956
(Lee Jung Sub)

2535
01:57:30,365 --> 01:57:32,665
(Siblings' Room, Yesterday)

2536
01:57:32,666 --> 01:57:33,734
You are exhausted, right?

2537
01:57:33,735 --> 01:57:35,764
I was exhausted at first. It was draining.

2538
01:57:35,765 --> 01:57:38,265
That's right. Things were hectic at first.

2539
01:57:38,636 --> 01:57:39,806
Is there anyone you like?

2540
01:57:40,876 --> 01:57:41,945
Well...

2541
01:57:42,546 --> 01:57:45,215
- Is there? - He just seems nice.

2542
01:57:45,216 --> 01:57:46,315
- He just seems nice. - Yes.

2543
01:57:46,876 --> 01:57:48,175
- So there is someone, - Yes.

2544
01:57:48,176 --> 01:57:49,515
but you won't tell me who he is.

2545
01:57:50,145 --> 01:57:52,285
- But it's already... No. - All right.

2546
01:57:52,286 --> 01:57:53,855
Is there someone you like?

2547
01:57:54,485 --> 01:57:55,955
As for me,

2548
01:57:55,956 --> 01:57:58,796
I thought someone had a good vibe.

2549
01:57:59,256 --> 01:58:00,325
I thought...

2550
01:58:01,056 --> 01:58:03,426
Cho A had a good vibe.

2551
01:58:03,966 --> 01:58:05,496
- Really? - Yes.

2552
01:58:07,735 --> 01:58:09,836
Really? I had no idea.

2553
01:58:10,706 --> 01:58:11,836
I see.

2554
01:58:12,775 --> 01:58:14,636
I like Yong Woo.

2555
01:58:15,136 --> 01:58:17,376
I think Yong Woo would be number one by far.

2556
01:58:18,075 --> 01:58:21,015
He is so handsome. As soon as I saw him, I just...

2557
01:58:21,815 --> 01:58:23,715
began to have a headache.

2558
01:58:23,716 --> 01:58:26,055
When he came out...

2559
01:58:26,056 --> 01:58:28,056
(Dizzy)

2560
01:58:29,185 --> 01:58:30,985
"Why are they doing this to me?"

2561
01:58:32,525 --> 01:58:34,154
Jae Hyung is so good-looking.

2562
01:58:34,155 --> 01:58:36,095
- He has an idol's face. - He totally looks like an idol.

2563
01:58:36,096 --> 01:58:38,125
I didn't know someone like him existed in Korea.

2564
01:58:38,126 --> 01:58:39,635
When it comes to looks, you aren't...

2565
01:58:39,636 --> 01:58:40,796
- I am not lacking? - No.

2566
01:58:40,996 --> 01:58:42,006
Okay.

2567
01:58:42,636 --> 01:58:44,206
The two of us...

2568
01:58:47,405 --> 01:58:50,875
(Since you didn't receive any messages,)

2569
01:58:50,876 --> 01:58:53,944
(you will choose an undelivered one.)

2570
01:58:53,945 --> 01:58:57,145
(Deliver the remaining message to your sibling.)

2571
01:58:57,945 --> 01:58:59,755
Only one message remains, right?

2572
01:58:59,756 --> 01:59:00,814
Whose was it?

2573
01:59:00,815 --> 01:59:02,586
Was it Se Seung's?

2574
01:59:02,956 --> 01:59:05,455
- Yes, Se Seung's message remains. - That's good.

2575
01:59:05,456 --> 01:59:06,724
- What? - That's good.

2576
01:59:06,725 --> 01:59:07,756
What?

2577
01:59:10,225 --> 01:59:12,895
There is something.

2578
01:59:13,496 --> 01:59:15,065
Where are you going?

2579
01:59:16,206 --> 01:59:19,575
I hadn't received any messages.

2580
01:59:19,905 --> 01:59:22,746
For a second, I was like, "What is this situation?"

2581
01:59:23,506 --> 01:59:27,216
"Did they prepare a message so that he wouldn't feel hurt?"

2582
01:59:30,185 --> 01:59:32,615
(She takes out a message as if there is no problem.)

2583
01:59:34,386 --> 01:59:37,355
(The last message remains.)

2584
01:59:41,195 --> 01:59:42,824
- What is it? - A message.

2585
01:59:42,825 --> 01:59:44,166
What?

2586
01:59:44,565 --> 01:59:45,596
Read it.

2587
01:59:46,435 --> 01:59:48,195
Did you write it?

2588
01:59:48,365 --> 01:59:49,535
(The last message was delivered to Jung Sub.)

2589
01:59:49,536 --> 01:59:50,734
- Read it. - This is...

2590
01:59:50,735 --> 01:59:52,435
Let's read it together.

2591
01:59:53,806 --> 01:59:55,345
What does it say?

2592
01:59:55,346 --> 01:59:56,575
Hold on. This is...

2593
01:59:58,645 --> 02:00:02,315
Hold on. "I think our personalities match."

2594
02:00:02,615 --> 02:00:04,285
"Let's have fun on our date."

2595
02:00:04,286 --> 02:00:07,886
"I hope you're the one I want to give this note to."

2596
02:00:09,525 --> 02:00:10,655
That's what the note says.

2597
02:00:11,725 --> 02:00:15,666
(Se Seung's note was delivered to Jung Sub.)

2598
02:00:16,496 --> 02:00:18,126
- It turned out well. - I know.

2599
02:00:19,395 --> 02:00:20,565
Who has a green pen?

2600
02:00:22,235 --> 02:00:25,065
- Who has a green pen? - The color.

2601
02:00:25,405 --> 02:00:26,435
What?

2602
02:00:27,806 --> 02:00:30,806
The thing is, we don't know if this note is for me.

2603
02:00:31,105 --> 02:00:32,145
No.

2604
02:00:34,515 --> 02:00:36,786
What if there was a mistake in the delivery?

2605
02:00:37,615 --> 02:00:40,415
And the sender could have made a wrong guess.

2606
02:00:40,416 --> 02:00:42,755
But you know who wrote this note.

2607
02:00:42,756 --> 02:00:43,786
Yes.

2608
02:00:44,056 --> 02:00:46,695
She can't tell him.

2609
02:00:46,996 --> 02:00:48,926
It's a heartbreaking situation.

2610
02:00:50,325 --> 02:00:52,796
Can you tell me who she is?

2611
02:00:53,136 --> 02:00:54,536
- What? - I am curious.

2612
02:00:56,206 --> 02:00:57,234
Who is it?

2613
02:00:57,235 --> 02:00:58,465
(He continues to corner her.)

2614
02:00:58,466 --> 02:00:59,536
Can you tell me?

2615
02:01:00,235 --> 02:01:01,805
(She quickly messages the production crew.)

2616
02:01:01,806 --> 02:01:03,176
(What should I do? What should I say?)

2617
02:01:04,475 --> 02:01:07,345
"Should I tell him honestly or not?"

2618
02:01:07,346 --> 02:01:11,184
I was so torn in that short period of time.

2619
02:01:11,185 --> 02:01:12,185
"What should I do?"

2620
02:01:13,756 --> 02:01:16,386
"Should I tell him or not?"

2621
02:01:17,256 --> 02:01:19,556
It's a bit too late to tell him.

2622
02:01:19,996 --> 02:01:21,225
Don't tell him.

2623
02:01:24,166 --> 02:01:26,336
Your roommate is Cho A, right?

2624
02:01:26,666 --> 02:01:27,835
- Yes. - Right?

2625
02:01:27,836 --> 02:01:30,006
Yes. Use that well.

2626
02:01:30,605 --> 02:01:31,666
Okay.

2627
02:01:33,935 --> 02:01:35,006
It's Cho A, right?

2628
02:01:35,605 --> 02:01:37,445
(Laughing)

2629
02:01:38,475 --> 02:01:39,945
- Right? - What?

2630
02:01:40,916 --> 02:01:43,984
He was happy about receiving a note.

2631
02:01:43,985 --> 02:01:46,514
When I saw that,

2632
02:01:46,515 --> 02:01:48,355
it became harder to tell the truth.

2633
02:01:48,756 --> 02:01:49,785
Oh, no.

2634
02:01:49,786 --> 02:01:51,855
(Your time in the Siblings' Room is over.)

2635
02:01:52,855 --> 02:01:54,855
(She couldn't tell him the truth.)

2636
02:01:55,195 --> 02:01:57,126
I ended up lying to him.

2637
02:01:57,525 --> 02:01:58,525
I think it was the right choice.

2638
02:01:59,136 --> 02:02:00,694
Had I told him outright,

2639
02:02:00,695 --> 02:02:03,735
his feelings would have been hurt.

2640
02:02:04,435 --> 02:02:06,635
(And this morning)

2641
02:02:06,636 --> 02:02:07,935
"Preparedness."

2642
02:02:08,206 --> 02:02:10,345
Why did you write "Preparedness?"

2643
02:02:10,346 --> 02:02:11,405
What?

2644
02:02:11,706 --> 02:02:14,014
(Affectionate)

2645
02:02:14,015 --> 02:02:15,245
Why are you making me flustered?

2646
02:02:15,246 --> 02:02:17,445
You can't make me flustered.

2647
02:02:18,386 --> 02:02:20,315
Why are you making me flustered?

2648
02:02:21,815 --> 02:02:22,925
My goodness.

2649
02:02:22,926 --> 02:02:25,154
- She is happy. - "Those punks."

2650
02:02:25,155 --> 02:02:27,224
- "Look at them." - It must be really fun.

2651
02:02:27,225 --> 02:02:29,024
I bet she will help out her brother.

2652
02:02:29,025 --> 02:02:30,865
That was the big sister's smile.

2653
02:02:30,996 --> 02:02:33,194
"They are interested in each other."

2654
02:02:33,195 --> 02:02:34,536
I had that thought.

2655
02:02:37,136 --> 02:02:39,136
He began to make an egg dish...

2656
02:02:39,475 --> 02:02:42,405
by stir-frying eggs and onions.

2657
02:02:42,775 --> 02:02:45,105
I thought, "What's up with him?"

2658
02:02:47,916 --> 02:02:50,185
- It must have been so funny. - It must have been so funny.

2659
02:02:50,386 --> 02:02:52,355
This one? Okay.

2660
02:02:52,855 --> 02:02:55,085
- Do you want to try it? - Yes.

2661
02:02:55,086 --> 02:02:56,956
- Yes. - All right.

2662
02:02:59,225 --> 02:03:01,524
When I see my sister talk to guys,

2663
02:03:01,525 --> 02:03:03,165
it's so funny.

2664
02:03:03,166 --> 02:03:06,095
It's so entertaining...

2665
02:03:06,096 --> 02:03:09,005
that I can see it happen in real life.

2666
02:03:09,006 --> 02:03:11,404
That's good. It's a good shot.

2667
02:03:11,405 --> 02:03:12,435
(The enthusiastic photographer)

2668
02:03:14,435 --> 02:03:15,574
Okay. Three.

2669
02:03:15,575 --> 02:03:16,644
It was very fun.

2670
02:03:16,645 --> 02:03:18,945
It was thrilling to catch her in that moment.

2671
02:03:19,176 --> 02:03:21,876
In terms of first impression,

2672
02:03:22,315 --> 02:03:24,444
my sister would be the most popular.

2673
02:03:24,445 --> 02:03:26,886
(And tonight)

2674
02:03:32,325 --> 02:03:36,296
(Two people chose your sibling.)

2675
02:03:46,506 --> 02:03:49,974
(All messages have been sent.)

2676
02:03:49,975 --> 02:03:52,745
(Yun Ha didn't receive a message.)

2677
02:03:52,746 --> 02:03:56,046
I felt so devastated.

2678
02:03:56,445 --> 02:03:59,314
I felt so dejected. Seriously.

2679
02:03:59,315 --> 02:04:00,416
"Is this the reality?"

2680
02:04:02,115 --> 02:04:03,756
I was sad.

2681
02:04:06,256 --> 02:04:09,096
(She hides her sadness behind a smile.)

2682
02:04:09,265 --> 02:04:12,695
I wanted to receive a lot of messages.

2683
02:04:13,596 --> 02:04:16,105
I guess I was...

2684
02:04:16,765 --> 02:04:18,905
too optimistic.

2685
02:04:19,876 --> 02:04:20,905
Yes.

2686
02:04:21,735 --> 02:04:26,176
(No one chose your sibling.)

2687
02:04:27,075 --> 02:04:31,246
(He found out that his sister didn't receive any messages.)

2688
02:04:35,386 --> 02:04:37,485
I checked her facial expression.

2689
02:04:39,626 --> 02:04:42,125
She seemed very upset.

2690
02:04:42,126 --> 02:04:45,364
The two messages I received made me thankful.

2691
02:04:45,365 --> 02:04:47,265
I was happy, of course.

2692
02:04:47,695 --> 02:04:51,065
But I was more worried about my sibling.

2693
02:05:00,376 --> 02:05:02,746
- Let's go. - My goodness.

2694
02:05:20,235 --> 02:05:22,165
All right. We received a card.

2695
02:05:22,166 --> 02:05:23,166
All right.

2696
02:05:25,836 --> 02:05:26,974
What is this?

2697
02:05:26,975 --> 02:05:29,104
"Underground Hideout has opened."

2698
02:05:29,105 --> 02:05:30,105
- What? - What?

2699
02:05:30,905 --> 02:05:32,675
- Underground Hideout? - No way.

2700
02:05:32,676 --> 02:05:35,075
- Is there a hideout? - Underground Hideout?

2701
02:05:35,615 --> 02:05:37,184
"Once you find the entrance,"

2702
02:05:37,185 --> 02:05:38,514
- "you can enter." - That must be it.

2703
02:05:38,515 --> 02:05:39,614
- That must be it. - No way.

2704
02:05:39,615 --> 02:05:41,615
- That's insane. - I got goosebumps.

2705
02:05:41,815 --> 02:05:43,426
This is incredible.

2706
02:05:46,725 --> 02:05:48,525
(Last night)

2707
02:05:48,756 --> 02:05:50,126
What is this place?

2708
02:05:51,565 --> 02:05:53,336
Is it a door?

2709
02:05:54,096 --> 02:05:56,105
- What? - Is it open?

2710
02:05:58,765 --> 02:05:59,774
I guess it isn't a door.

2711
02:05:59,775 --> 02:06:00,806
(Is this a wall or a door?)

2712
02:06:02,945 --> 02:06:05,475
(There was a wall that piqued their curiosity.)

2713
02:06:07,916 --> 02:06:09,014
- No way. - That's insane.

2714
02:06:09,015 --> 02:06:10,785
I got goosebumps.

2715
02:06:10,786 --> 02:06:12,556
This is incredible.

2716
02:06:12,985 --> 02:06:16,455
"You can use the hideout freely today."

2717
02:06:16,456 --> 02:06:17,955
"From tomorrow onward."

2718
02:06:17,956 --> 02:06:19,496
"it will be available upon reservation."

2719
02:06:19,996 --> 02:06:24,626
"The hideout can only be used by 1 man and 1 woman."

2720
02:06:25,065 --> 02:06:26,934
"The reservation methods will be revealed later."

2721
02:06:26,935 --> 02:06:28,064
Shall I read it one more time?

2722
02:06:28,065 --> 02:06:29,535
- I understood. - Okay.

2723
02:06:29,536 --> 02:06:32,234
- That was fast. - That explains everything.

2724
02:06:32,235 --> 02:06:35,505
I understand everything about yesterday and today.

2725
02:06:35,506 --> 02:06:37,846
All the situations. Do you know what I mean?

2726
02:06:39,346 --> 02:06:41,975
- Hold on. - No, I don't.

2727
02:06:42,246 --> 02:06:44,715
- I understand. - You understand, right?

2728
02:06:44,716 --> 02:06:47,014
I understand why...

2729
02:06:47,015 --> 02:06:49,385
things were all over the place.

2730
02:06:49,386 --> 02:06:51,354
- I understand. - It was for this moment.

2731
02:06:51,355 --> 02:06:52,555
- You know, - This is incredible.

2732
02:06:52,556 --> 02:06:55,025
I understood at once for the first time ever.

2733
02:06:56,626 --> 02:06:58,395
- We get along so well. - I know.

2734
02:06:58,865 --> 02:07:00,695
You guys are like soulmates.

2735
02:07:01,636 --> 02:07:03,565
It was so impactful.

2736
02:07:03,836 --> 02:07:06,234
Gosh, for the first time in a while,

2737
02:07:06,235 --> 02:07:10,074
I received a proper surprise.

2738
02:07:10,075 --> 02:07:12,416
For the first time in a while,

2739
02:07:12,975 --> 02:07:14,416
I felt a dopamine rush.

2740
02:07:16,615 --> 02:07:18,985
- No way. - This is insane.

2741
02:07:21,185 --> 02:07:22,285
You found it right away.

2742
02:07:22,286 --> 02:07:23,484
- My goodness. - Hold on.

2743
02:07:23,485 --> 02:07:25,285
- It's spacious. - What is this?

2744
02:07:25,286 --> 02:07:27,455
- This is insane. - No way.

2745
02:07:27,456 --> 02:07:30,996
I never imagined to see a staircase down there.

2746
02:07:31,626 --> 02:07:32,734
You found it right away.

2747
02:07:32,735 --> 02:07:33,965
- My goodness. - Hold on.

2748
02:07:33,966 --> 02:07:35,835
- It's spacious. - What is this?

2749
02:07:35,836 --> 02:07:37,965
- This is insane. - No way.

2750
02:07:37,966 --> 02:07:41,475
I never imagined to see a staircase down there.

2751
02:07:42,206 --> 02:07:43,206
- Shall we go down? - Let's go.

2752
02:07:43,207 --> 02:07:44,945
- Shall we go down? - Can we enter together?

2753
02:07:45,475 --> 02:07:47,145
I thought it was for 1-on-1 dates.

2754
02:07:47,445 --> 02:07:49,715
- It's just today. - We can check it out today.

2755
02:07:49,716 --> 02:07:50,846
We can look around the place today.

2756
02:07:53,155 --> 02:07:54,256
It won't open.

2757
02:07:55,286 --> 02:07:57,725
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2758
02:07:57,985 --> 02:07:59,256
It won't open.

2759
02:07:59,496 --> 02:08:01,056
- My goodness. - What is this?

2760
02:08:01,456 --> 02:08:03,365
- They made it so well. - Seriously.

2761
02:08:04,166 --> 02:08:05,225
What?

2762
02:08:05,996 --> 02:08:07,235
- It's so cozy. - My goodness.

2763
02:08:07,996 --> 02:08:09,465
- I had no idea... - I love it.

2764
02:08:09,466 --> 02:08:11,765
such a pretty place was waiting for us.

2765
02:08:12,475 --> 02:08:13,876
They should have opened it sooner.

2766
02:08:15,136 --> 02:08:19,145
One spot looked like a cave with decorations of rocks.

2767
02:08:19,246 --> 02:08:21,315
That spot was very pretty.

2768
02:08:21,416 --> 02:08:22,515
This is incredible.

2769
02:08:25,716 --> 02:08:28,216
(When they open the door that is across from the staircase)

2770
02:08:30,725 --> 02:08:34,096
- There is another room. - Gosh, what is this room?

2771
02:08:35,296 --> 02:08:37,166
- It's so cute. - Right?

2772
02:08:37,926 --> 02:08:39,836
- My goodness. - It's so nice.

2773
02:08:40,895 --> 02:08:42,735
That phone looks familiar.

2774
02:08:43,065 --> 02:08:44,135
I also think it looks familiar.

2775
02:08:44,136 --> 02:08:45,565
Doesn't it look familiar?

2776
02:08:45,876 --> 02:08:47,335
- This place is insane. - There is wine.

2777
02:08:47,336 --> 02:08:49,205
- We didn't need to buy wine. - Jae Hyung.

2778
02:08:49,206 --> 02:08:51,075
- There is wine. - There is wine.

2779
02:08:51,775 --> 02:08:54,644
Things like a variety of liquor...

2780
02:08:54,645 --> 02:08:56,546
were set up more nicely.

2781
02:08:56,645 --> 02:08:58,286
I thought, "Is this place the real deal?"

2782
02:09:06,996 --> 02:09:08,425
Love or Blood.

2783
02:09:08,426 --> 02:09:10,496
This place is called Love or Blood.

2784
02:09:13,036 --> 02:09:16,364
- That's right. - A lover or a sibling.

2785
02:09:16,365 --> 02:09:17,365
One of the two.

2786
02:09:17,706 --> 02:09:19,475
Shall we come down here with the drinks?

2787
02:09:19,975 --> 02:09:21,375
- Let's hang out here. - Let's do that.

2788
02:09:21,376 --> 02:09:23,605
This place is nice.

2789
02:09:23,706 --> 02:09:25,144
- Let's bring the drinks. - Let's do that.

2790
02:09:25,145 --> 02:09:27,176
Let's hang out freely here.

2791
02:09:27,945 --> 02:09:29,944
The place is much bigger than I expected.

2792
02:09:29,945 --> 02:09:31,615
- It's so big. - My goodness.

2793
02:09:32,586 --> 02:09:35,154
That place would make you tell what's in your heart.

2794
02:09:35,155 --> 02:09:36,426
- Seriously. - It's incredible.

2795
02:09:36,825 --> 02:09:39,154
People will cry and laugh there.

2796
02:09:39,155 --> 02:09:40,694
"How dare you do that to my sister?"

2797
02:09:40,695 --> 02:09:41,894
- People will cry and laugh. - "How dare you?"

2798
02:09:41,895 --> 02:09:43,166
- It will be a ruckus. - If that happens...

2799
02:09:43,825 --> 02:09:45,096
They are drinking already.

2800
02:09:48,435 --> 02:09:49,605
This place is so pretty.

2801
02:09:50,206 --> 02:09:51,764
That sign is really witty.

2802
02:09:51,765 --> 02:09:52,975
- Love or Blood? - Yes.

2803
02:09:53,275 --> 02:09:56,506
Why do we need to use this place with one member of the opposite sex?

2804
02:09:56,746 --> 02:09:59,046
You can either book it with your sibling...

2805
02:09:59,615 --> 02:10:02,275
- or someone you are interested in. - I see.

2806
02:10:02,945 --> 02:10:05,416
My sister seemed upset.

2807
02:10:05,515 --> 02:10:08,615
As soon as I read the letter about the Underground Hideout,

2808
02:10:09,756 --> 02:10:11,786
I decided to book it with my sister.

2809
02:10:12,456 --> 02:10:16,966
The message had a big impact.

2810
02:10:17,666 --> 02:10:19,636
It's a personal belonging.

2811
02:10:23,105 --> 02:10:25,974
(Tomorrow is the day of the Cupid Date.)

2812
02:10:25,975 --> 02:10:29,006
(The time and location will be delivered separately.)

2813
02:10:34,846 --> 02:10:38,445
When I received that message, I became very excited.

2814
02:10:38,546 --> 02:10:42,724
It was more exciting than sending...

2815
02:10:42,725 --> 02:10:44,056
a message.

2816
02:10:44,185 --> 02:10:45,685
As for the Cupid Date,

2817
02:10:46,225 --> 02:10:49,024
both the sender and the recipient don't know...

2818
02:10:49,025 --> 02:10:50,466
who their dates are.

2819
02:10:50,765 --> 02:10:52,096
It's so fascinating.

2820
02:10:53,136 --> 02:10:55,395
"Would I be the one..."

2821
02:10:55,966 --> 02:10:57,636
"this woman wanted?"

2822
02:10:58,336 --> 02:10:59,876
I had that thought.

2823
02:11:00,206 --> 02:11:04,046
At the same time, I thought that I should enjoy myself...

2824
02:11:04,475 --> 02:11:05,676
on a date.

2825
02:11:06,876 --> 02:11:08,876
I felt very excited then.

2826
02:11:11,886 --> 02:11:15,985
By the way, we need to listen to Jae Hyung's piano performance.

2827
02:11:16,456 --> 02:11:17,456
Guitar?

2828
02:11:17,586 --> 02:11:18,985
Can Jae Hyung play the piano?

2829
02:11:19,355 --> 02:11:22,154
- I think so. - Yes, he can. He plays the guitar,

2830
02:11:22,155 --> 02:11:23,626
- so he knows the chords. - I see.

2831
02:11:24,265 --> 02:11:26,535
I am curious about...

2832
02:11:26,536 --> 02:11:28,095
- Jae Hyung's guitar performance - Me too.

2833
02:11:28,096 --> 02:11:30,005
- I am curious. - You look like the best guitarist.

2834
02:11:30,006 --> 02:11:31,764
Me? No, I can't play the guitar.

2835
02:11:31,765 --> 02:11:33,036
You look like an expert.

2836
02:11:33,636 --> 02:11:35,575
I am a man with unexpected charms.

2837
02:11:36,376 --> 02:11:37,944
- I look like I am good, right? - All right.

2838
02:11:37,945 --> 02:11:39,275
- I am bad at it. - All right.

2839
02:11:40,575 --> 02:11:42,015
You can't play the guitar.

2840
02:11:42,815 --> 02:11:45,346
You don't seem so shy anymore.

2841
02:11:45,945 --> 02:11:47,155
Me? That's right.

2842
02:11:47,815 --> 02:11:51,385
And everyone seems so nice.

2843
02:11:51,386 --> 02:11:53,194
- That's why I didn't let down... - That's right.

2844
02:11:53,195 --> 02:11:54,525
my guard.

2845
02:11:55,325 --> 02:11:56,695
You didn't let down your guard?

2846
02:11:56,796 --> 02:11:58,324
- You didn't let down your guard? - I let down my guard.

2847
02:11:58,325 --> 02:12:00,095
- Still... - I said the opposite thing.

2848
02:12:00,096 --> 02:12:02,596
- I have unexpected charms. - Still, I understood everything.

2849
02:12:03,735 --> 02:12:05,064
Seriously, I understood everything.

2850
02:12:05,065 --> 02:12:07,035
- I don't want to... - You are the best.

2851
02:12:07,036 --> 02:12:09,845
correct you in any way.

2852
02:12:09,846 --> 02:12:11,075
I understood what you meant to say.

2853
02:12:12,176 --> 02:12:14,114
The two of you could converse with your eyes later on.

2854
02:12:14,115 --> 02:12:15,645
- I know. - Seriously.

2855
02:12:16,645 --> 02:12:17,815
I will go to bed now.

2856
02:12:18,786 --> 02:12:20,555
Are you going to bed since you have work tomorrow?

2857
02:12:20,556 --> 02:12:21,955
Yes, I will retire a bit early.

2858
02:12:21,956 --> 02:12:24,386
- Okay. Good night. - Good night.

2859
02:12:24,886 --> 02:12:26,824
- Are you retiring to your room? - Yes, I will retire a bit early.

2860
02:12:26,825 --> 02:12:28,354
- That's too bad. - Good night.

2861
02:12:28,355 --> 02:12:30,224
- She must be tired. - Get a good rest.

2862
02:12:30,225 --> 02:12:32,264
- See you later. - Bye.

2863
02:12:32,265 --> 02:12:33,265
(Cho A retires to the room.)

2864
02:12:35,235 --> 02:12:36,336
Jae Hyung.

2865
02:12:36,636 --> 02:12:38,435
I am going to leave after five minutes.

2866
02:12:38,536 --> 02:12:40,774
- Okay. Sit down for a second. - I need to go to work tomorrow.

2867
02:12:40,775 --> 02:12:42,676
- Jae Hyung, is that your bare face? - Yes.

2868
02:12:43,575 --> 02:12:46,075
- You have amazing skin. - You look the same.

2869
02:12:46,445 --> 02:12:48,846
Jae Hyung, you look much better without makeup.

2870
02:12:50,485 --> 02:12:53,155
My brother came to the hideout with his bare face.

2871
02:12:53,386 --> 02:12:55,386
He looked much better without makeup.

2872
02:12:55,815 --> 02:12:59,125
All of us went, "Jae Hyung, you look better without makeup."

2873
02:12:59,126 --> 02:13:01,325
I really didn't want to say it myself,

2874
02:13:01,725 --> 02:13:04,595
but I had made up my mind to help...

2875
02:13:04,596 --> 02:13:06,096
my brother.

2876
02:13:06,636 --> 02:13:08,465
"Jae Hyung, you have an amazing skin."

2877
02:13:08,466 --> 02:13:11,065
"Your bare face looks great." I said that.

2878
02:13:11,265 --> 02:13:15,035
Ju Yeon said that my brother looked like Gong Yoo.

2879
02:13:15,036 --> 02:13:17,105
I figured out Jae Hyung's celebrity lookalike.

2880
02:13:17,546 --> 02:13:18,806
Who is it?

2881
02:13:19,346 --> 02:13:20,346
Gong Yoo.

2882
02:13:20,775 --> 02:13:22,074
I also had a bit of that thought.

2883
02:13:22,075 --> 02:13:23,145
- Right? - Yes.

2884
02:13:24,185 --> 02:13:27,085
She didn't say, "I also had that thought."

2885
02:13:27,086 --> 02:13:29,055
"I also had a bit of that thought." That was her pride.

2886
02:13:29,056 --> 02:13:30,255
- "A bit." - "A bit."

2887
02:13:30,256 --> 02:13:31,256
She couldn't agree with it wholeheartedly.

2888
02:13:31,257 --> 02:13:32,625
"I also had a bit of that thought."

2889
02:13:32,626 --> 02:13:35,695
I gritted my teeth and said, "He really looks like Gong Yoo."

2890
02:13:37,496 --> 02:13:38,595
He resembles Gong Yoo so much.

2891
02:13:38,596 --> 02:13:39,934
It isn't easy to look like Gong Yoo.

2892
02:13:39,935 --> 02:13:41,734
- Gong Yoo. - You heard that a lot, right?

2893
02:13:41,735 --> 02:13:44,135
- Your gestures are relaxed. - No.

2894
02:13:44,136 --> 02:13:45,666
- I am hot, that's all. - They are relaxed.

2895
02:13:46,105 --> 02:13:48,536
- A cup of Kanu. - You look like Gong Yoo.

2896
02:13:48,806 --> 02:13:51,005
Isn't it MINHO by SHINee?

2897
02:13:51,006 --> 02:13:52,404
Someone said he looked like MINHO by SHINee,

2898
02:13:52,405 --> 02:13:53,775
so I said, "He really looks like MINHO."

2899
02:13:54,346 --> 02:13:55,875
He looks like MINHO.

2900
02:13:55,876 --> 02:13:57,045
He looks like MINHO.

2901
02:13:57,046 --> 02:13:58,885
- He looks more like MINHO. - MINHO of SHINee.

2902
02:13:58,886 --> 02:13:59,984
But MINHO...

2903
02:13:59,985 --> 02:14:01,315
I really see the resemblance.

2904
02:14:02,556 --> 02:14:04,355
I made an effort.

2905
02:14:06,796 --> 02:14:09,195
Gosh, I am exhausted.

2906
02:14:11,865 --> 02:14:13,136
- How cute. - My goodness.

2907
02:14:13,895 --> 02:14:16,966
- She worked so hard. - It was a mechanical reaction.

2908
02:14:17,065 --> 02:14:18,305
She is so nice.

2909
02:14:18,306 --> 02:14:19,434
I am in tears.

2910
02:14:19,435 --> 02:14:20,876
Even if he knows, he will be happy.

2911
02:14:21,306 --> 02:14:22,535
He looks more like MINHO...

2912
02:14:22,536 --> 02:14:23,876
- than Gong Yoo. - MINHO.

2913
02:14:23,975 --> 02:14:25,245
This part looks the same.

2914
02:14:25,246 --> 02:14:26,645
- This part. - That's right.

2915
02:14:27,246 --> 02:14:29,175
I think it's the eyebrows.

2916
02:14:29,176 --> 02:14:30,386
You are right.

2917
02:14:31,886 --> 02:14:33,756
I was the third person to move into the house.

2918
02:14:34,115 --> 02:14:35,455
He was the first person.

2919
02:14:35,456 --> 02:14:38,256
As soon as I saw him, I thought, "This is insane."

2920
02:14:39,725 --> 02:14:41,296
Was that when you fell in love?

2921
02:14:41,855 --> 02:14:44,065
- Did you like him like that? - A little bit.

2922
02:14:44,166 --> 02:14:45,495
"How does he look so handsome?"

2923
02:14:45,496 --> 02:14:47,065
Maybe you will go on a date with me tomorrow.

2924
02:14:49,065 --> 02:14:51,765
No. Maybe the two of them will be down here tomorrow.

2925
02:14:52,506 --> 02:14:53,506
The two of them.

2926
02:14:54,806 --> 02:14:56,405
Let's spend time together tomorrow as well.

2927
02:14:58,376 --> 02:15:00,444
- I suddenly want to eat pizza. - Pizza?

2928
02:15:00,445 --> 02:15:02,746
- What kind of pizza do you like? - Pizza?

2929
02:15:03,145 --> 02:15:05,915
These days, corn pizza is tasty.

2930
02:15:05,916 --> 02:15:08,615
I can't believe it. I love corn pizza so much.

2931
02:15:09,155 --> 02:15:11,086
Do you like wood-fired pizza?

2932
02:15:11,185 --> 02:15:14,456
I like wood-fired pizza. I always keep the dough thin.

2933
02:15:14,556 --> 02:15:16,694
I will take you to a pizza place and teach you a lesson...

2934
02:15:16,695 --> 02:15:18,095
- one day. - Thin dough is tasty.

2935
02:15:18,096 --> 02:15:20,935
- Will you teach me a lesson? - Yes.

2936
02:15:22,435 --> 02:15:23,435
What?

2937
02:15:23,435 --> 02:15:24,435
(Laughing)

2938
02:15:24,436 --> 02:15:25,934
You were flustered, right?

2939
02:15:25,935 --> 02:15:28,074
- No. - I hadn't seen that face before.

2940
02:15:28,075 --> 02:15:29,075
- No. - For a second...

2941
02:15:31,506 --> 02:15:34,245
- I hadn't seen that face before. - I won.

2942
02:15:34,246 --> 02:15:36,945
I almost said "I will" in a cute way too.

2943
02:15:38,046 --> 02:15:39,614
- I almost did it. - He flirted with you.

2944
02:15:39,615 --> 02:15:40,815
I almost did it.

2945
02:15:41,315 --> 02:15:44,255
With his clear eyes that was full of madness,

2946
02:15:44,256 --> 02:15:46,796
he looked at me and acted cute.

2947
02:15:47,496 --> 02:15:49,195
I am a sucker for cute people.

2948
02:15:49,796 --> 02:15:52,665
I fell for Jae Hyung's cuteness.

2949
02:15:52,666 --> 02:15:53,935
That was why I froze for a second.

2950
02:15:55,065 --> 02:15:57,264
My brother isn't the type to become flustered.

2951
02:15:57,265 --> 02:16:00,136
I think he is someone who has a retort to every comment.

2952
02:16:00,506 --> 02:16:01,975
He was flustered for the first time.

2953
02:16:02,435 --> 02:16:06,245
So everyone froze for a second...

2954
02:16:06,246 --> 02:16:07,815
before bursting out in laughter.

2955
02:16:08,246 --> 02:16:10,386
They said Yong Woo became flustered for the first time.

2956
02:16:10,985 --> 02:16:13,885
I want to become closer to Jae Hyung.

2957
02:16:13,886 --> 02:16:17,126
I am so curious about his cute side.

2958
02:16:18,855 --> 02:16:20,726
- I need to get going. - Really?

2959
02:16:20,826 --> 02:16:22,194
- I am going to go to bed. - Get a good rest.

2960
02:16:22,195 --> 02:16:25,025
- Okay. See you tomorrow. - Are you going to go to bed?

2961
02:16:25,966 --> 02:16:28,165
(Yong Woo's cute question didn't reach him.)

2962
02:16:28,865 --> 02:16:30,505
- Good night. - He didn't hear it.

2963
02:16:30,605 --> 02:16:31,605
Maybe this is better.

2964
02:16:32,165 --> 02:16:33,875
- You should have said it louder. - You were too quiet.

2965
02:16:33,876 --> 02:16:35,004
- No. - You took a hit earlier.

2966
02:16:35,005 --> 02:16:37,445
He might have said something, so this is better.

2967
02:16:37,546 --> 02:16:39,546
I will go up to the room and ask, "Are you asleep?"

2968
02:16:41,745 --> 02:16:42,745
"Are you asleep?"

2969
02:16:45,986 --> 02:16:49,014
Thank you for your hard work. See you tomorrow.

2970
02:16:49,015 --> 02:16:50,025
Okay.

2971
02:16:50,326 --> 02:16:52,725
(The day of the first date)

2972
02:16:52,726 --> 02:16:54,494
(Time passes so fast.)

2973
02:16:54,495 --> 02:16:56,695
(We don't need to part ways.)

2974
02:16:58,966 --> 02:17:00,395
(An idol?)

2975
02:17:00,396 --> 02:17:01,735
(You were an idol, right?)

2976
02:17:01,736 --> 02:17:03,236
(I was a crazy one.)

2977
02:17:04,935 --> 02:17:06,335
(Is this fate?)

2978
02:17:09,406 --> 02:17:11,674
(I am embarrassed.)

2979
02:17:11,675 --> 02:17:15,445
(The person I was looking for is here.)

2980
02:17:16,345 --> 02:17:19,286
(The annoying sibling is here too.)

2981
02:17:20,015 --> 02:17:21,684
(I am going to give you a hug.)

2982
02:17:21,685 --> 02:17:23,855
(What's wrong with him?)

2983
02:17:27,025 --> 02:17:28,025
(Cho A)

2984
02:17:29,025 --> 02:17:30,325
(Why did you come back so late?)

2985
02:17:30,326 --> 02:17:31,465
(Did you guys come together?)

2986
02:17:31,466 --> 02:17:33,135
(Did you guys come together?)

2987
02:17:33,136 --> 02:17:34,365
That's incredible.

2988
02:17:34,595 --> 02:17:38,104
(A mysterious photo album that is hidden in the house)

2989
02:17:38,105 --> 02:17:40,736
- That's incredible. - What?

2990
02:17:41,306 --> 02:17:42,906
- Are you serious? - What?

2991
02:17:44,076 --> 02:17:45,476
(Is this the profession?)

2992
02:17:45,576 --> 02:17:47,976
It has to be real. It can't be a hobby.

2993
02:17:48,076 --> 02:17:49,646
What a twist.
