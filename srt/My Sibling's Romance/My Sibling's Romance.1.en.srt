1
00:00:00,094 --> 00:00:02,964
Can you remember the earliest memory about your childhood?

2
00:00:02,965 --> 00:00:05,033
(What's your earliest memory about your sibling?)

3
00:00:05,034 --> 00:00:06,564
Yes. I can.

4
00:00:07,235 --> 00:00:09,665
But I can't remember how old I was.

5
00:00:12,834 --> 00:00:16,344
My parents used to fight...

6
00:00:16,345 --> 00:00:17,814
quite often.

7
00:00:18,374 --> 00:00:21,444
I went into my older brother's room because I didn't want to hear them.

8
00:00:21,785 --> 00:00:25,514
When I entered his room, he said we should read a book together.

9
00:00:25,755 --> 00:00:27,883
He was sitting at his desk.

10
00:00:27,884 --> 00:00:29,785
And I was sitting on his bed.

11
00:00:29,954 --> 00:00:33,394
That was the first time I read "The Little Prince."

12
00:00:33,395 --> 00:00:34,594
That's the memory...

13
00:00:35,624 --> 00:00:36,624
I remember.

14
00:00:38,365 --> 00:00:40,763
(I was born...)

15
00:00:40,764 --> 00:00:44,505
(as the younger sister to a brother.)

16
00:00:49,344 --> 00:00:51,213
(It turned out...)

17
00:00:51,214 --> 00:00:53,515
(he and I were inseparable.)

18
00:00:55,645 --> 00:00:59,955
(My older brother had been in my memory since my birth and on.)

19
00:01:04,755 --> 00:01:08,194
(The siblings reached adulthood while watching each other.)

20
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:13,035
(And they all gathered here today.)

21
00:01:14,964 --> 00:01:18,905
(Do you have a sibling whom you share lifetime's memories?)

22
00:01:20,604 --> 00:01:23,604
(Do you get along well with your sibling?)

23
00:01:24,044 --> 00:01:25,244
We rarely fight.

24
00:01:28,684 --> 00:01:30,785
He just does a lot of useless pranks.

25
00:01:31,485 --> 00:01:34,324
For example, he would come into my room and wouldn't leave.

26
00:01:35,024 --> 00:01:36,824
I would do impressions of actors.

27
00:01:38,354 --> 00:01:39,523
Which one of you jerks...

28
00:01:39,524 --> 00:01:41,764
(He's doing an impression of an actor.)

29
00:01:41,765 --> 00:01:43,834
poured water into the cup?

30
00:01:45,895 --> 00:01:47,304
It's not that funny.

31
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:51,934
We must have fought before.

32
00:01:52,104 --> 00:01:55,104
I couldn't remember, so I asked him about the time we fought.

33
00:01:55,345 --> 00:01:56,745
He said he remembered something.

34
00:01:57,514 --> 00:01:59,043
She said I said this to her.

35
00:01:59,044 --> 00:02:00,614
"Are you dumb? Why can't you find the path?"

36
00:02:00,884 --> 00:02:02,944
She got upset at me and told me not to call her dumb.

37
00:02:03,954 --> 00:02:06,113
When we were little, we really...

38
00:02:06,114 --> 00:02:07,354
We really fought a lot.

39
00:02:07,854 --> 00:02:09,655
That's it. I wanted to get on her nerves.

40
00:02:11,324 --> 00:02:12,725
I said, "You're freaking annoying. Leave."

41
00:02:13,595 --> 00:02:14,893
Then my brother said,

42
00:02:14,894 --> 00:02:17,025
"If you're annoyed, just say you're annoyed."

43
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:19,065
"Why did you say 'freaking?'"

44
00:02:20,535 --> 00:02:23,264
Wouldn't you be so annoyed? I was really annoyed.

45
00:02:24,275 --> 00:02:25,335
Right.

46
00:02:29,544 --> 00:02:33,215
(Are you interested in your sibling's relationships?)

47
00:02:35,884 --> 00:02:37,144
It must work out well for me.

48
00:02:38,055 --> 00:02:40,354
My brother has been doing a good job with dating on his own.

49
00:02:40,725 --> 00:02:42,255
I've met his ex-girlfriend before.

50
00:02:42,725 --> 00:02:44,953
It just made me cringe...

51
00:02:44,954 --> 00:02:48,394
because he was probably sweet to his girlfriend.

52
00:02:48,764 --> 00:02:50,495
He tends to act cute in front of his girlfriend.

53
00:02:54,734 --> 00:02:56,504
I heard that he said stuff like "oof" to his girlfriend.

54
00:02:56,505 --> 00:02:57,603
Then he kept saying that in front of me.

55
00:02:57,604 --> 00:02:59,234
But hearing that would be torture for me.

56
00:02:59,574 --> 00:03:01,204
I thought, "Has he gone mad?"

57
00:03:01,305 --> 00:03:03,603
He knew that I didn't like that.

58
00:03:03,604 --> 00:03:05,874
So he started saying that whenever he could since then.

59
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:07,785
- Like before. - So that's what he says, right?

60
00:03:07,914 --> 00:03:11,854
(Are you ready to watch your sibling's romance?)

61
00:03:15,655 --> 00:03:17,085
Gosh, I think it will be really funny.

62
00:03:18,424 --> 00:03:20,055
I think it will be funny.

63
00:03:23,694 --> 00:03:25,534
Never.

64
00:03:25,535 --> 00:03:26,535
(Here's the most important rule.)

65
00:03:26,536 --> 00:03:29,364
(Don't let other people find out who your sibling is.)

66
00:03:29,935 --> 00:03:31,374
But don't we look alike?

67
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:33,304
- But pretend she's not your sister. - You still have to pretend, though.

68
00:03:33,305 --> 00:03:36,744
When my brother's face gets puffy in the morning after he wakes up,

69
00:03:36,745 --> 00:03:38,114
he and I resemble each other more.

70
00:03:38,674 --> 00:03:40,044
I'll still pretend I'm not his sister.

71
00:03:43,215 --> 00:03:45,284
Let's say other people think...

72
00:03:45,285 --> 00:03:47,354
we are siblings because we resemble each other.

73
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:49,284
But it turns out we aren't each other's siblings,

74
00:03:49,285 --> 00:03:50,894
but we're interested in each other.

75
00:03:51,025 --> 00:03:52,954
It means we are drawn to similar-looking people.

76
00:03:53,155 --> 00:03:54,565
- That could happen too. - That could happen too.

77
00:03:54,694 --> 00:03:56,965
What would men say to flirt with her?

78
00:03:57,364 --> 00:03:59,664
Actually, I'm curious about that.

79
00:04:03,234 --> 00:04:07,674
(What awaits them in store?)

80
00:04:12,015 --> 00:04:13,145
Pretend as if they had never met before?

81
00:04:13,414 --> 00:04:14,543
- Gosh. - They have to pretend...

82
00:04:14,544 --> 00:04:16,043
- Gosh. Hold on. - Is that possible?

83
00:04:16,044 --> 00:04:17,553
How could they do that? It's their family.

84
00:04:17,554 --> 00:04:18,753
- It'll be so interesting to watch. - How is that possible?

85
00:04:18,754 --> 00:04:19,954
I would crack up as soon as I see him.

86
00:04:19,955 --> 00:04:21,155
- How could they do that? - Exactly.

87
00:04:21,354 --> 00:04:23,253
- This sounds interesting. - Right.

88
00:04:23,254 --> 00:04:25,253
I bet this show will get on our nerves in a good way.

89
00:04:25,254 --> 00:04:28,265
Actually, they might be good at pretending to be strangers.

90
00:04:28,494 --> 00:04:29,524
They're siblings.

91
00:04:29,525 --> 00:04:30,594
- They can stick to what they do. - It might be the contrary?

92
00:04:30,595 --> 00:04:32,293
- Just stick to what they do? - Yes.

93
00:04:32,294 --> 00:04:33,734
- They can stick to what they do. - Right.

94
00:04:33,934 --> 00:04:35,334
- It can be the contrary. - There's no interest in each other.

95
00:04:35,335 --> 00:04:36,634
From the third person's point of view,

96
00:04:36,635 --> 00:04:37,905
it might look like they're perfect strangers.

97
00:04:38,104 --> 00:04:39,835
- That's possible. - That's possible.

98
00:04:39,975 --> 00:04:42,404
By the way, I thought I'd be able to pair up the siblings.

99
00:04:42,405 --> 00:04:44,674
- But it's harder than I think. - I can't pair them up.

100
00:04:44,744 --> 00:04:45,774
I have no idea so far.

101
00:04:45,775 --> 00:04:47,544
- I'm so clueless. - I have no idea. Seriously.

102
00:04:48,044 --> 00:04:50,984
The title of our show is My Sibling's Romance.

103
00:04:51,215 --> 00:04:54,224
"Sibling" and "romance." Actually, these two keywords...

104
00:04:54,225 --> 00:04:56,884
- rarely go together. - They don't go together.

105
00:04:56,885 --> 00:04:58,594
- Never. - You know there's this saying.

106
00:04:58,595 --> 00:05:00,724
- Yes. - Women are the best judge of women.

107
00:05:00,725 --> 00:05:03,395
- Right. There's a saying like that. - Men are the best judge of men.

108
00:05:03,494 --> 00:05:06,335
Since they're siblings, they can share objective opinions.

109
00:05:06,595 --> 00:05:08,063
- "The guy you're dating now..." - Right.

110
00:05:08,064 --> 00:05:09,563
- "isn't that great." - Right.

111
00:05:09,564 --> 00:05:12,205
They can give each other advice about relationships.

112
00:05:13,304 --> 00:05:14,474
Wouldn't they be able to give...

113
00:05:14,475 --> 00:05:15,673
- more honest opinions? - Right.

114
00:05:15,674 --> 00:05:16,743
- They can be a bit more... - Right.

115
00:05:16,744 --> 00:05:17,844
No. That's not going to work.

116
00:05:17,845 --> 00:05:19,413
They won't be able to watch each other going on dates.

117
00:05:19,414 --> 00:05:20,614
- That's true. - Listen.

118
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:22,384
- They wouldn't be able to focus. - It's the instinct.

119
00:05:22,385 --> 00:05:23,385
It's physically impossible to watch.

120
00:05:23,386 --> 00:05:25,354
- It might be the case for you two. - Listen.

121
00:05:25,715 --> 00:05:27,454
- First of all, when the siblings... - It's the same.

122
00:05:27,455 --> 00:05:29,154
- are with their date, - Right.

123
00:05:29,155 --> 00:05:30,423
they would change their voice.

124
00:05:30,424 --> 00:05:31,655
- That would be annoying. - They'll watch that in person.

125
00:05:31,754 --> 00:05:33,024
I wouldn't be able to watch from that point on.

126
00:05:33,025 --> 00:05:34,725
- You must've seen Patricia do that. - Never.

127
00:05:34,794 --> 00:05:35,863
- Yes. She's doing that now too. - Gosh, no.

128
00:05:35,864 --> 00:05:38,635
That's not true. This is my true voice.

129
00:05:38,794 --> 00:05:40,233
How would it be for you, Jonathan?

130
00:05:40,234 --> 00:05:42,334
What if you were to participate with Patricia?

131
00:05:42,335 --> 00:05:44,303
- But... - To participate... Here's a thing.

132
00:05:44,304 --> 00:05:46,003
When she first got the offer, she thought she would participate.

133
00:05:46,004 --> 00:05:47,775
I thought I would be a participant.

134
00:05:47,945 --> 00:05:49,243
- Seriously. I really thought so. - That's possible.

135
00:05:49,244 --> 00:05:50,574
- She thinks she's some star. - I thought...

136
00:05:50,575 --> 00:05:52,714
if I should start working out.

137
00:05:52,715 --> 00:05:53,913
I was like, "Where do I start with?"

138
00:05:53,914 --> 00:05:56,215
I told her that we would be watching other people date...

139
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:58,015
and to calm down.

140
00:05:58,455 --> 00:05:59,885
"Calm down?"

141
00:06:00,385 --> 00:06:02,253
What about you guys? Do you have any siblings?

142
00:06:02,254 --> 00:06:04,294
I have 2 older brothers and 1 younger sister.

143
00:06:05,395 --> 00:06:07,765
I have one younger brother.

144
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:10,094
- To be honest, I wouldn't want... - Your brother...

145
00:06:10,095 --> 00:06:11,894
to watch my brother going on dates.

146
00:06:11,895 --> 00:06:12,933
Right.

147
00:06:12,934 --> 00:06:14,464
You said it precisely. No one would want to watch that.

148
00:06:14,465 --> 00:06:16,933
I'd like to think that he would find love on his own and be happy.

149
00:06:16,934 --> 00:06:18,433
Do you have a sibling?

150
00:06:18,434 --> 00:06:20,335
- I have a younger brother. - What if he was on our show?

151
00:06:20,874 --> 00:06:23,004
- Gosh. Why would he? - Goodness.

152
00:06:24,945 --> 00:06:27,313
MIYEON. By the way, only you don't have any siblings among us.

153
00:06:27,314 --> 00:06:29,584
Right. I'm so clueless about this...

154
00:06:29,585 --> 00:06:31,714
because I don't have any siblings. I'm the only child.

155
00:06:31,715 --> 00:06:33,154
We really need your input on the show.

156
00:06:33,155 --> 00:06:35,225
- Right. You can be objective. - Yes.

157
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,793
- Since I'm the only child, - Yes.

158
00:06:38,794 --> 00:06:40,623
I have this fantasy about siblings.

159
00:06:40,624 --> 00:06:41,694
- Like what? - I...

160
00:06:41,695 --> 00:06:43,563
I don't think having a sibling would be a hassle.

161
00:06:43,564 --> 00:06:45,595
- I think it might be fun. - I see.

162
00:06:45,851 --> 00:06:48,320
In a way, my sibling could give me good advice.

163
00:06:48,345 --> 00:06:50,585
- Do you want an older brother? - I guess I'm wrong.

164
00:06:50,586 --> 00:06:52,354
Or do you want a younger sibling?

165
00:06:52,355 --> 00:06:53,855
I would want an older brother.

166
00:06:53,956 --> 00:06:55,125
I get the feeling...

167
00:06:55,126 --> 00:06:56,855
- Right. She's the only child. - he would give me such good advice.

168
00:06:57,055 --> 00:06:59,725
I think having an older brother would be helpful.

169
00:07:00,425 --> 00:07:02,765
I will shatter your fantasy about having an older brother...

170
00:07:02,766 --> 00:07:04,934
- to pieces through the show. - Right.

171
00:07:04,935 --> 00:07:06,665
That's what sisters always say about their brothers.

172
00:07:06,766 --> 00:07:08,765
- Seriously. - I'm so curious.

173
00:07:08,766 --> 00:07:10,765
- I love watching sitcoms. - Yes.

174
00:07:10,766 --> 00:07:13,776
In sitcoms, there are always brothers and sisters.

175
00:07:13,935 --> 00:07:15,075
- Yes. - Right.

176
00:07:15,076 --> 00:07:16,104
- Right. - That's right.

177
00:07:16,105 --> 00:07:17,474
- So this show might remind us... - Everyone's different.

178
00:07:17,475 --> 00:07:18,776
of watching a sitcom.

179
00:07:18,975 --> 00:07:20,876
- Like an entertaining sitcom. - It'll be entertaining.

180
00:07:21,086 --> 00:07:23,115
- Let's watch the video now. - Sounds great.

181
00:08:38,055 --> 00:08:42,295
(The first participant, Jae Hyung, arrives.)

182
00:09:27,435 --> 00:09:29,146
I'm the first one here.

183
00:09:46,226 --> 00:09:48,194
(Residence guideline)

184
00:09:48,195 --> 00:09:49,664
(You cannot tell other people who your sibling is.)

185
00:09:49,665 --> 00:09:50,865
(Call each other by their name without the last name.)

186
00:09:50,866 --> 00:09:52,135
(Focus on getting to know each other on the first day.)

187
00:09:52,136 --> 00:09:53,334
(You cannot reveal your age or job.)

188
00:09:53,335 --> 00:09:54,565
(Find out about each other only through conversations here.)

189
00:09:54,965 --> 00:09:56,534
- Only by their name. Right! - Without the last name.

190
00:09:56,535 --> 00:09:58,475
The mystery will be spoiled the moment they mention last names.

191
00:09:58,476 --> 00:10:01,075
- That must be really tough. - They'll have to keep thinking.

192
00:10:01,445 --> 00:10:02,475
Don't siblings use full names...

193
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:03,544
- when they call each other? - We do.

194
00:10:03,545 --> 00:10:04,914
- Right. We use full names. - Exactly.

195
00:10:04,915 --> 00:10:06,245
Hey, you know a lot about siblings.

196
00:10:06,246 --> 00:10:08,285
- We rarely call them by their name. - Really?

197
00:10:08,585 --> 00:10:09,914
She just calls me "Hey."

198
00:10:09,915 --> 00:10:11,886
What are you talking about?

199
00:10:11,915 --> 00:10:14,054
- You must be honest on TV. - Gosh, Patricia.

200
00:10:14,055 --> 00:10:16,454
- You're making stuff up. - Patricia, you must be honest.

201
00:10:16,455 --> 00:10:18,055
I address you properly as my brother.

202
00:10:18,195 --> 00:10:19,856
- "Jonathan. My brother." - They're typical siblings.

203
00:10:19,925 --> 00:10:21,026
They're so funny.

204
00:10:23,325 --> 00:10:25,396
(He puts the residence guideline back on the table.)

205
00:10:27,636 --> 00:10:29,606
(Checking the scent)

206
00:11:20,585 --> 00:11:21,925
This is too long.

207
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:51,684
Is this a doll too?

208
00:11:51,685 --> 00:11:52,986
(Studying another doll)

209
00:11:57,356 --> 00:11:58,825
(Checking the scent for the 2nd time)

210
00:12:05,065 --> 00:12:07,165
(Sniffing for the 3rd time)

211
00:12:17,406 --> 00:12:19,846
Actually, I felt awkward when I first arrived.

212
00:12:20,045 --> 00:12:22,846
So I wanted to hold on to something.

213
00:12:24,185 --> 00:12:26,116
Hugging the doll significantly helped me relax.

214
00:12:28,386 --> 00:12:30,886
I didn't know who would come or when they would arrive.

215
00:12:31,356 --> 00:12:34,496
I was nervous and got butterflies too.

216
00:12:35,425 --> 00:12:37,425
I looked forward to meeting other people.

217
00:12:40,096 --> 00:12:41,835
When will they come?

218
00:13:30,315 --> 00:13:34,756
(The second participant, Se Seung, arrives.)

219
00:13:58,915 --> 00:14:00,315
- Hello. - Hello.

220
00:14:00,945 --> 00:14:02,215
Hello.

221
00:14:03,815 --> 00:14:05,355
- Wait. Was it just you here? - Yes.

222
00:14:05,356 --> 00:14:06,356
Really?

223
00:14:07,685 --> 00:14:09,125
- He looked. We must be observant. - What?

224
00:14:09,126 --> 00:14:10,126
- Wait. - We must observe them carefully.

225
00:14:10,127 --> 00:14:12,256
- They're not siblings. - They're not siblings.

226
00:14:12,626 --> 00:14:13,655
- What? Are they? - Are they siblings?

227
00:14:13,656 --> 00:14:14,726
She's looking away.

228
00:14:22,335 --> 00:14:23,935
What were you doing?

229
00:14:26,835 --> 00:14:27,934
- They can't be. Wait, are they? - No.

230
00:14:27,935 --> 00:14:29,304
- They're not siblings. - No?

231
00:14:29,305 --> 00:14:30,346
- No. - No?

232
00:14:31,006 --> 00:14:32,476
What were you doing?

233
00:14:34,045 --> 00:14:35,085
I was just...

234
00:14:35,886 --> 00:14:37,115
I just got here too.

235
00:14:37,116 --> 00:14:38,715
- Did you just get here? - Yes.

236
00:14:39,085 --> 00:14:40,615
- To be honest... - You look really cold.

237
00:14:40,616 --> 00:14:42,356
- I'm really cold. - Here's your blanket.

238
00:14:42,986 --> 00:14:44,655
- That's the blanket. - I see.

239
00:14:44,656 --> 00:14:46,856
- Okay. - There are blankets here and there.

240
00:14:48,396 --> 00:14:49,396
Thank you.

241
00:14:50,565 --> 00:14:51,765
You should read...

242
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:52,965
- the residence guideline. - Okay.

243
00:15:01,075 --> 00:15:04,045
I think we can exchange names.

244
00:15:04,305 --> 00:15:05,346
Just our first names.

245
00:15:05,675 --> 00:15:07,214
I see. Right. My name is Jae Hyung.

246
00:15:07,215 --> 00:15:08,314
- Jae Hyung. - Jae Hyung?

247
00:15:08,315 --> 00:15:09,315
- Yes. - I see.

248
00:15:09,316 --> 00:15:11,455
My name is Se Seung.

249
00:15:11,815 --> 00:15:12,815
- Se Seung? - Yes.

250
00:15:12,816 --> 00:15:13,986
- It's spelled S-E. Se Seung. - I see.

251
00:15:14,585 --> 00:15:16,526
- My name is kind of unique. - Yes.

252
00:15:18,695 --> 00:15:21,795
I thought there would be a lot of people here.

253
00:15:22,465 --> 00:15:24,195
- Same here. - Right?

254
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:27,236
When I first came in, no one was here.

255
00:15:35,205 --> 00:15:38,616
- It's awkward. - Yes.

256
00:15:42,085 --> 00:15:43,315
- This house... - This house is...

257
00:15:43,715 --> 00:15:46,055
- quite colorful. - Right.

258
00:15:46,715 --> 00:15:49,185
I see a lot of cute things here.

259
00:15:50,285 --> 00:15:51,596
That smells really good.

260
00:15:52,425 --> 00:15:54,125
- The scent... - This? The diffuser?

261
00:15:54,126 --> 00:15:55,925
The diffuser...

262
00:15:58,026 --> 00:15:59,194
(As he actively demonstrates...)

263
00:15:59,195 --> 00:16:00,266
This one smells nice.

264
00:16:00,866 --> 00:16:03,805
(she also smells it.)

265
00:16:08,075 --> 00:16:09,376
I'm really sorry.

266
00:16:10,106 --> 00:16:12,575
I was so nervous earlier. I forgot your name.

267
00:16:14,075 --> 00:16:16,615
- It's Jae Hyung. - Right. Jae Hyung.

268
00:16:16,616 --> 00:16:17,616
Hyung. Yes.

269
00:16:17,617 --> 00:16:19,116
- J-A-E, right? - Yes.

270
00:16:20,356 --> 00:16:22,185
I see. Thank you.

271
00:16:23,356 --> 00:16:24,655
My name is Se Seung. Just in case you forgot.

272
00:16:24,656 --> 00:16:26,496
I didn't. I rarely forget names.

273
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:27,695
Is that so?

274
00:16:31,535 --> 00:16:34,165
(A man walks toward the house.)

275
00:16:40,335 --> 00:16:42,305
(He suddenly turns around...)

276
00:16:44,406 --> 00:16:47,645
(and enters someone else's parking lot.)

277
00:16:47,646 --> 00:16:49,985
(Parking lot)

278
00:16:49,986 --> 00:16:50,986
What?

279
00:16:53,816 --> 00:16:54,925
What do I have to do?

280
00:16:55,425 --> 00:16:57,626
Put in four numbers for the passcode.

281
00:16:57,955 --> 00:16:58,995
Wait.

282
00:17:01,126 --> 00:17:02,265
I see. It's that way?

283
00:17:05,296 --> 00:17:07,665
(He tries to look cool as he starts walking again.)

284
00:17:08,866 --> 00:17:11,336
(100m until the house)

285
00:17:16,146 --> 00:17:17,146
Is this the house?

286
00:17:17,147 --> 00:17:18,845
(He talks to a neighbor.)

287
00:17:18,846 --> 00:17:20,774
- Are you filming something? - Yes.

288
00:17:20,775 --> 00:17:22,215
(He almost walked into a wrong house again.)

289
00:17:23,945 --> 00:17:25,185
I see. This is the house.

290
00:17:26,985 --> 00:17:29,586
(At the end of his 100m-long adventure,)

291
00:17:31,386 --> 00:17:34,896
(he barely manages to arrive at the right house.)

292
00:17:48,346 --> 00:17:49,406
Someone's here.

293
00:17:50,806 --> 00:17:54,475
(The third participant, Jung Sub, arrives.)

294
00:17:56,846 --> 00:17:57,944
Should we say hello?

295
00:17:57,945 --> 00:17:59,385
I mean... Should we say hello at the door?

296
00:17:59,386 --> 00:18:00,816
Gosh, this is so awkward.

297
00:18:03,685 --> 00:18:04,725
We'll soon see who it is.

298
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:06,656
- Hello. - Hello.

299
00:18:06,925 --> 00:18:07,955
- Hello. - Hello.

300
00:18:10,566 --> 00:18:11,636
Make yourself comfortable.

301
00:18:20,306 --> 00:18:21,306
- What was that? - What?

302
00:18:23,675 --> 00:18:24,675
- We got them! - They're siblings!

303
00:18:24,676 --> 00:18:26,345
- They must be siblings! - We got them.

304
00:18:26,346 --> 00:18:27,346
- I knew it. - They have to be.

305
00:18:27,347 --> 00:18:28,385
- We figured it out. - We got them.

306
00:18:28,386 --> 00:18:29,744
- The staff members are surprised. - They have to be siblings.

307
00:18:29,745 --> 00:18:31,984
- They are so surprised right now. - We figured it out.

308
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:34,386
- Gosh. Game over. - It's over.

309
00:18:34,586 --> 00:18:35,754
That was so obvious, right?

310
00:18:35,755 --> 00:18:36,755
- Yes. - Yes.

311
00:18:39,695 --> 00:18:41,826
Could you read that?

312
00:18:41,925 --> 00:18:44,195
- It's the residence guideline. - I see. Okay. Thank you.

313
00:18:44,495 --> 00:18:46,465
- Thank you. - You must be nervous.

314
00:18:46,796 --> 00:18:49,235
Read that, and take a deep breath too.

315
00:19:00,346 --> 00:19:01,376
- Hello. - Gosh.

316
00:19:02,286 --> 00:19:04,646
- We only exchanged names. - Okay.

317
00:19:05,086 --> 00:19:06,116
What's your name?

318
00:19:06,515 --> 00:19:08,585
- My name is Jung Sub. - Jung Sub?

319
00:19:08,586 --> 00:19:09,786
- Yes. - Jung Sub.

320
00:19:10,786 --> 00:19:13,255
My name is Se Seung.

321
00:19:13,356 --> 00:19:14,356
- Se Seung? - Yes.

322
00:19:14,357 --> 00:19:16,224
- My name is Jae Hyung. - Jae Hyung?

323
00:19:16,225 --> 00:19:17,326
Yes. Jae Hyung.

324
00:19:17,965 --> 00:19:20,365
- Jung Sub. - Yes. That's my name.

325
00:19:20,366 --> 00:19:21,596
- Jung Sub. - Jae Hyung. Okay.

326
00:19:29,705 --> 00:19:31,146
What kind of food do you like?

327
00:19:31,475 --> 00:19:32,715
I like steak.

328
00:19:33,015 --> 00:19:34,146
- Steak? - Yes.

329
00:19:34,376 --> 00:19:36,586
- You must like western food. - Yes.

330
00:19:36,816 --> 00:19:37,846
I see.

331
00:19:38,015 --> 00:19:39,286
- What kind of food do you like? - Steak...

332
00:19:39,556 --> 00:19:40,985
- I like meat. - Meat.

333
00:19:41,886 --> 00:19:43,754
I like Japanese food.

334
00:19:43,755 --> 00:19:45,895
- Japanese food. - Like sukiyaki.

335
00:19:45,896 --> 00:19:46,955
Sukiyaki.

336
00:19:47,626 --> 00:19:48,865
Your voice...

337
00:19:48,866 --> 00:19:50,325
- You have a nice voice. - sounds nice.

338
00:19:50,326 --> 00:19:52,566
Gosh, no. You look very handsome.

339
00:19:53,636 --> 00:19:55,036
What's this?

340
00:19:55,336 --> 00:19:56,665
You're exchanging compliments.

341
00:19:56,906 --> 00:19:57,965
I'm here too.

342
00:19:58,576 --> 00:19:59,606
Gosh.

343
00:20:17,056 --> 00:20:19,126
Did you guys talk about your MBTI types?

344
00:20:19,255 --> 00:20:20,255
- No. - Not yet.

345
00:20:20,256 --> 00:20:23,125
I was going to bring that up when we got more people.

346
00:20:23,126 --> 00:20:24,165
When there are more people?

347
00:20:24,326 --> 00:20:25,964
In case I didn't remember them.

348
00:20:25,965 --> 00:20:27,734
- Really? - You're a planner.

349
00:20:27,735 --> 00:20:28,806
He's a planner.

350
00:20:29,765 --> 00:20:31,035
- His type must end up J. - I gave you a hint.

351
00:20:31,036 --> 00:20:32,136
He's a planner.

352
00:20:33,076 --> 00:20:34,735
- Aren't you an extrovert? - Yes.

353
00:20:34,935 --> 00:20:36,546
It's crystal clear that he is.

354
00:20:37,046 --> 00:20:38,106
He's the MC.

355
00:20:38,846 --> 00:20:40,876
I think his type might be ESFJ.

356
00:20:41,215 --> 00:20:42,586
Gosh, you came up with that right away.

357
00:20:42,886 --> 00:20:44,514
- ESFJ? - I'm like an expert on MBTI types.

358
00:20:44,515 --> 00:20:45,786
- Really? - Really?

359
00:20:46,015 --> 00:20:47,816
But I doubt you could get a degree on MBTI types.

360
00:20:48,556 --> 00:20:49,725
- Was I wrong? - Yes.

361
00:20:50,725 --> 00:20:53,225
- What... - She sounded so confident.

362
00:20:53,396 --> 00:20:55,225
- Wait. He's a thinking type. - But she was wrong by half.

363
00:20:56,126 --> 00:20:57,626
- He's a thinking type. - His type ends with TJ.

364
00:20:58,396 --> 00:21:01,035
Given his reaction, he has to be a thinking type.

365
00:21:01,036 --> 00:21:02,764
My type is ENTJ.

366
00:21:02,765 --> 00:21:04,465
- I see. I was off by a lot. - ENTJ.

367
00:21:05,536 --> 00:21:06,836
Are you an ISFJ?

368
00:21:07,136 --> 00:21:08,646
(Trailing off)

369
00:21:09,945 --> 00:21:11,406
He and I are quite similar.

370
00:21:12,215 --> 00:21:13,376
- Are you an ISTJ? - Does it end with TJ?

371
00:21:13,775 --> 00:21:15,616
(Pausing)

372
00:21:16,146 --> 00:21:17,546
My type is ENTJ.

373
00:21:19,415 --> 00:21:20,415
What?

374
00:21:21,356 --> 00:21:23,056
- Why were you hiding it? - What?

375
00:21:23,225 --> 00:21:25,194
When you said you were an ISFJ,

376
00:21:25,195 --> 00:21:26,295
you gave me the opposite type on purpose.

377
00:21:26,296 --> 00:21:27,296
Right.

378
00:21:27,955 --> 00:21:29,095
- Totally. - Wait.

379
00:21:29,096 --> 00:21:30,694
- We have the same type. - Right.

380
00:21:30,695 --> 00:21:32,296
No wonder. You guys seemed to click well.

381
00:21:32,695 --> 00:21:33,735
This is totally...

382
00:21:34,396 --> 00:21:35,465
bromance.

383
00:21:37,106 --> 00:21:38,505
Should I give you two some privacy?

384
00:21:39,205 --> 00:21:40,406
- No. It's cold over there. - It's okay.

385
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:31,586
(She rings the bell.)

386
00:22:32,195 --> 00:22:34,355
Shouldn't you open the door, Mr. Homeowner?

387
00:22:34,356 --> 00:22:36,494
- Were we supposed to ring the bell? - How? But it's open.

388
00:22:36,495 --> 00:22:37,525
I just opened the door too.

389
00:22:38,665 --> 00:22:40,195
I opened it without any hesitation.

390
00:22:44,036 --> 00:22:45,435
- Hello. - Hello.

391
00:22:47,675 --> 00:22:49,646
The door wasn't locked.

392
00:22:49,806 --> 00:22:50,906
- Really? - Yes.

393
00:22:51,576 --> 00:22:52,745
You can put on the indoor slippers.

394
00:22:54,175 --> 00:22:55,175
Thank you.

395
00:22:57,546 --> 00:22:59,386
- The three of us are... - We're all standing up.

396
00:23:01,185 --> 00:23:03,754
(The fourth participant, Cho A, arrives.)

397
00:23:03,755 --> 00:23:06,725
- Hello. - Hello.

398
00:23:07,626 --> 00:23:09,825
We have blankets here too.

399
00:23:09,826 --> 00:23:11,796
- I see. Thank you. - Choose the color you want.

400
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:16,606
- Aren't you cold? Isn't it cold? - It's so cold.

401
00:23:16,836 --> 00:23:17,934
Here's the blanket.

402
00:23:17,935 --> 00:23:19,336
Okay. Thank you.

403
00:23:22,505 --> 00:23:24,305
This is the residence guideline.

404
00:23:24,306 --> 00:23:25,376
Okay.

405
00:23:33,955 --> 00:23:35,285
- They resemble each other. - They look alike.

406
00:23:35,286 --> 00:23:36,826
Doesn't it look like he's avoiding her?

407
00:23:36,985 --> 00:23:38,055
- Doesn't it look like... - Jung Sub...

408
00:23:38,056 --> 00:23:39,125
Jung Sub isn't looking at her?

409
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:40,826
How come everyone looks alike?

410
00:23:45,695 --> 00:23:47,036
When did you guys get here?

411
00:23:47,265 --> 00:23:48,964
We've been here for a while.

412
00:23:48,965 --> 00:23:50,036
A while?

413
00:23:50,306 --> 00:23:52,705
- We should go over the names. - Yes, we should do that.

414
00:23:52,975 --> 00:23:54,075
- My name is Cho A. - Okay.

415
00:23:54,076 --> 00:23:55,204
- Cho A. - Cho A.

416
00:23:55,205 --> 00:23:56,245
Cho A.

417
00:23:56,306 --> 00:23:58,146
- My name is Jae Hyung. - Okay.

418
00:23:58,475 --> 00:23:59,515
My name is Se Seung.

419
00:23:59,846 --> 00:24:01,714
My name is Jung Sub.

420
00:24:01,715 --> 00:24:02,885
- Jung Sub. - Yes.

421
00:24:02,886 --> 00:24:03,886
Okay.

422
00:24:04,046 --> 00:24:05,615
You have a beautiful name, Cho A.

423
00:24:05,616 --> 00:24:06,616
Thank you.

424
00:24:06,617 --> 00:24:08,485
- Cho A... "I like Cho A." - Like the celebrity.

425
00:24:09,425 --> 00:24:11,656
What? You're going to flirt with her just like that?

426
00:24:12,755 --> 00:24:14,425
That was so random.

427
00:24:14,695 --> 00:24:16,626
- I... - "I like Cho A."

428
00:24:17,725 --> 00:24:20,136
"I like Cho A." Welcome!

429
00:24:20,366 --> 00:24:22,805
I have this tendency that I must share all the jokes I think of.

430
00:24:22,806 --> 00:24:24,335
I see. I like it.

431
00:24:24,336 --> 00:24:26,275
- I think it's good. - I like it.

432
00:24:27,376 --> 00:24:28,806
I regret it a little.

433
00:24:29,576 --> 00:24:30,675
I shouldn't have said it.

434
00:24:32,316 --> 00:24:34,346
- I like Cho A. - I like Cho A.

435
00:24:35,175 --> 00:24:36,944
You're the first person who rang the doorbell.

436
00:24:36,945 --> 00:24:38,855
- Really? - That was cute.

437
00:24:38,856 --> 00:24:41,414
- I just barged in. - Really?

438
00:24:41,415 --> 00:24:43,925
- "We had to ring the bell?" - Seriously.

439
00:24:44,386 --> 00:24:47,425
Did you find the way here right away?

440
00:24:48,056 --> 00:24:49,424
- Yes. - Really?

441
00:24:49,425 --> 00:24:52,494
Do you have a bad sense of direction?

442
00:24:52,495 --> 00:24:53,536
Oh, my.

443
00:24:54,735 --> 00:24:57,105
- I was told to go straight... - I just went straight.

444
00:24:57,106 --> 00:24:58,165
Right.

445
00:24:59,306 --> 00:25:01,405
I should have gone straight as I was told,

446
00:25:01,406 --> 00:25:02,945
but I went sideways.

447
00:25:04,376 --> 00:25:06,245
I was like, "Could it be that way?"

448
00:25:07,015 --> 00:25:08,075
Do you have a good sense of direction?

449
00:25:08,076 --> 00:25:09,146
Yes.

450
00:25:09,546 --> 00:25:10,984
I'm rarely lost.

451
00:25:10,985 --> 00:25:13,086
- She's so confident. - That confidence.

452
00:25:13,915 --> 00:25:14,955
Why is that?

453
00:25:15,215 --> 00:25:16,286
Well...

454
00:25:18,626 --> 00:25:19,626
That startled me.

455
00:25:21,495 --> 00:25:23,664
We were talking about our MBTI types.

456
00:25:23,665 --> 00:25:24,665
I see.

457
00:25:24,925 --> 00:25:26,795
What was your MBTI type?

458
00:25:26,796 --> 00:25:28,494
I'm an ENFJ.

459
00:25:28,495 --> 00:25:30,265
- An ENFJ. - An ENFJ.

460
00:25:30,606 --> 00:25:32,335
Our MBTI types are similar.

461
00:25:32,336 --> 00:25:33,876
- The three of us. - You're right.

462
00:25:34,336 --> 00:25:36,406
These two are ENTJs.

463
00:25:37,445 --> 00:25:39,115
Cho A, we'll guess...

464
00:25:39,116 --> 00:25:40,645
- what your MBTI type is later. - We should talk more.

465
00:25:40,646 --> 00:25:43,485
- We should talk a little more. - We haven't talked enough.

466
00:25:44,185 --> 00:25:45,455
What kind of food do you like?

467
00:25:45,656 --> 00:25:47,514
- I like sweet foods. - Sweet foods.

468
00:25:47,515 --> 00:25:48,855
- Sweet foods? - What about dessert?

469
00:25:48,856 --> 00:25:51,826
Do you usually eat sweet foods?

470
00:25:52,396 --> 00:25:54,954
Are you talking about a type of food...

471
00:25:54,955 --> 00:25:56,724
or a certain dish?

472
00:25:56,725 --> 00:25:58,065
- When it comes to food... - She's a planner.

473
00:25:58,066 --> 00:25:59,066
I got that feeling too.

474
00:25:59,067 --> 00:26:00,764
- Now... - I'm serious about it.

475
00:26:00,765 --> 00:26:02,565
- Are you a J? - Her personality just came out.

476
00:26:02,566 --> 00:26:05,135
Are you an ISFJ or an INFJ?

477
00:26:05,136 --> 00:26:06,205
Right.

478
00:26:06,376 --> 00:26:07,674
All of us are planners.

479
00:26:07,675 --> 00:26:08,704
(All participants are J types.)

480
00:26:08,705 --> 00:26:09,775
- All of us. - Yes.

481
00:26:09,876 --> 00:26:10,905
It's fascinating.

482
00:26:10,906 --> 00:26:12,515
I feel like...

483
00:26:13,576 --> 00:26:16,015
everything will go well as planned.

484
00:26:17,086 --> 00:26:20,116
(One more participant is coming to the house.)

485
00:26:47,576 --> 00:26:49,945
- Someone is here. - Someone's here.

486
00:26:52,556 --> 00:26:56,955
(The fifth participant, Ju Yeon, arrives.)

487
00:26:59,396 --> 00:27:00,425
Should we stand up?

488
00:27:00,925 --> 00:27:02,725
She didn't ring the bell, by the way.

489
00:27:03,465 --> 00:27:04,994
- Hello. - Hello.

490
00:27:04,995 --> 00:27:07,295
- Hello. - I'm a little late.

491
00:27:07,296 --> 00:27:08,366
- Hello. - Hello.

492
00:27:08,765 --> 00:27:09,836
Well...

493
00:27:10,765 --> 00:27:12,405
Thanks.

494
00:27:12,406 --> 00:27:13,406
- Can I sit here? - Yes.

495
00:27:13,407 --> 00:27:15,005
- Yes. - Have a seat.

496
00:27:15,336 --> 00:27:17,805
- Hello. - I like how there's more noise.

497
00:27:17,806 --> 00:27:19,675
- Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

498
00:27:20,076 --> 00:27:21,115
It was cold, right?

499
00:27:21,116 --> 00:27:23,615
Can I ask you what your names are?

500
00:27:23,616 --> 00:27:25,116
My name is Cho A.

501
00:27:25,316 --> 00:27:27,856
- My name is Jae Hyung. - My name is Se Seung.

502
00:27:27,955 --> 00:27:29,585
My name is Jung Sub.

503
00:27:29,586 --> 00:27:30,826
- Jung Sub. - Yes.

504
00:27:30,925 --> 00:27:32,524
My name is Ju Yeon.

505
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:33,855
- Ju Yeon. - Ju Yeon.

506
00:27:33,856 --> 00:27:35,964
- Our MBTI types... - Did you talk about it?

507
00:27:35,965 --> 00:27:37,625
- Yes. We couldn't resist. - Yes.

508
00:27:37,626 --> 00:27:39,265
- You couldn't resist? - No.

509
00:27:39,636 --> 00:27:40,636
Are you an ESFJ?

510
00:27:40,637 --> 00:27:42,204
- Am I right? - That's amazing.

511
00:27:42,205 --> 00:27:43,405
- You are. - You're indeed good.

512
00:27:43,406 --> 00:27:46,035
- That's impressive. - How did you get it at once?

513
00:27:46,036 --> 00:27:48,035
- We're all J types. - We are?

514
00:27:48,036 --> 00:27:49,146
All of us are J types.

515
00:27:49,975 --> 00:27:52,315
- I feel so at ease. - What if...

516
00:27:52,316 --> 00:27:53,816
that was a requirement?

517
00:27:54,275 --> 00:27:55,315
"Are you a J type?"

518
00:27:55,316 --> 00:27:57,046
- "Yes." - "Are you a planner?"

519
00:28:17,136 --> 00:28:18,504
Don't you need slippers?

520
00:28:18,505 --> 00:28:20,274
- There are slippers. - Slippers?

521
00:28:20,275 --> 00:28:21,875
- Right on the shoe shelf. - They're on the shoe shelf.

522
00:28:21,876 --> 00:28:24,046
Is that so? I'll be back.

523
00:28:37,056 --> 00:28:38,355
Hello.

524
00:28:38,356 --> 00:28:39,725
- Hello. - Hello.

525
00:28:41,455 --> 00:28:42,494
That was her big picture.

526
00:28:42,495 --> 00:28:44,865
- She went to meet him there. - Her big picture.

527
00:28:44,866 --> 00:28:47,136
That's good.

528
00:28:47,636 --> 00:28:49,165
I ended up meeting him at the door.

529
00:28:49,765 --> 00:28:54,435
(The sixth participant, Cheol Hyeon, arrives.)

530
00:28:54,606 --> 00:28:56,274
All of us are standing for him.

531
00:28:56,275 --> 00:28:58,075
- Hello. - Hello.

532
00:28:58,076 --> 00:28:59,845

00:28:59,846 --> 00:29:01,775

534
00:29:05,755 --> 00:29:06,755
Here you are.

535
00:29:06,955 --> 00:29:08,386
Thanks.

536
00:29:09,586 --> 00:29:10,924
Aren't you cold?

537
00:29:10,925 --> 00:29:12,396
It's really cold outside.

538
00:29:12,656 --> 00:29:14,125
Do you want to cover yourself with it?

539
00:29:14,126 --> 00:29:15,556
Thanks.

540
00:29:17,066 --> 00:29:19,335
It suddenly became winter after it rained.

541
00:29:19,336 --> 00:29:20,396
I know.

542
00:29:23,036 --> 00:29:24,105
Glad to meet you.

543
00:29:24,106 --> 00:29:26,036
- Glad to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

544
00:29:26,935 --> 00:29:28,376
What's your name?

545
00:29:29,406 --> 00:29:30,474
My name is Cheol Hyeon.

546
00:29:30,475 --> 00:29:31,504

00:29:31,505 --> 00:29:33,244

553
00:29:41,915 --> 00:29:43,454
My name is Jung Sub.

554
00:29:43,455 --> 00:29:45,895
Jung Sub, Ju Yeon, Se Seung,

555
00:29:45,896 --> 00:29:47,125
- and Jae Hyung, right? - Yes.

556
00:29:47,126 --> 00:29:48,495
Jae Hyung and Cho A.

557
00:29:49,695 --> 00:29:50,826
I'm Cheol Hyeon.

558
00:29:52,965 --> 00:29:54,765
I said it, right?

559
00:29:55,036 --> 00:29:56,065
One round.

560
00:29:56,066 --> 00:29:57,664
- He made a round. - A round trip.

561
00:29:57,665 --> 00:30:00,636
- Like he was rhyming the names. - Rhyming the names.

562
00:30:02,846 --> 00:30:05,376
- You're good at memorizing names. - I know.

563
00:30:05,646 --> 00:30:07,514
But I forget easily.

564
00:30:07,515 --> 00:30:09,846
- That's why you went over it. - You reviewed the names.

565
00:30:14,586 --> 00:30:15,924
- It was so cold outside. - Right.

566
00:30:15,925 --> 00:30:18,255
- Take a breather. - Okay.

567
00:30:37,945 --> 00:30:40,474
- What have you been doing? - We were talking.

568
00:30:40,475 --> 00:30:42,115
- We talked about our MBTI types. - Small talk.

569
00:30:42,116 --> 00:30:43,546
MBTI types.

570
00:30:43,816 --> 00:30:44,984
- Can it be a hint? - He seems like a P.

571
00:30:44,985 --> 00:30:46,116
Totally.

572
00:30:46,515 --> 00:30:47,556
- P? - Yes.

573
00:30:48,255 --> 00:30:50,454
- Spontaneous... - Just now...

574
00:30:50,455 --> 00:30:51,785
- No, I'm not. - No?

575
00:30:51,786 --> 00:30:52,825
- Really? - Are you a J?

576
00:30:52,826 --> 00:30:54,455
Then all of us are Js.

577
00:30:55,695 --> 00:30:58,025
I've been getting ENTJ lately.

578
00:30:58,566 --> 00:31:00,895
I got ENFJ a lot before.

579
00:31:00,896 --> 00:31:02,805
The results keep changing.

580
00:31:02,806 --> 00:31:06,035
- All men are ENTJs. - Jung Sub and I...

581
00:31:06,036 --> 00:31:07,674
- are ENTJs. - ENTJs.

582
00:31:07,675 --> 00:31:09,345
- ENTJs? - Yes.

583
00:31:09,346 --> 00:31:11,174
- That's so interesting. - It is.

584
00:31:11,175 --> 00:31:12,205
It's fascinating.

585
00:31:13,015 --> 00:31:15,845
All three men have the same MBTI type.

586
00:31:15,846 --> 00:31:17,145
- How can it be like that? - Is that so?

587
00:31:17,146 --> 00:31:19,215
ENTJs are handsome, though.

588
00:31:19,556 --> 00:31:20,755
- Are you an ENTJ? - Yes.

589
00:31:24,086 --> 00:31:26,225
- That's why I didn't get ENTJ. - Our MBTI type...

590
00:31:26,326 --> 00:31:27,356
I see.

591
00:31:27,796 --> 00:31:30,964
I'm most curious about the cassette tapes.

592
00:31:30,965 --> 00:31:32,665
- What kind of music do you like? - Music?

593
00:31:32,896 --> 00:31:35,195
I like songs like Jannabi's.

594
00:31:36,235 --> 00:31:39,505
Do you know Carla Bruni?

595
00:31:39,735 --> 00:31:42,474
- No. - One of her songs...

596
00:31:42,475 --> 00:31:44,545
became popular because it was played...

597
00:31:44,546 --> 00:31:47,215
as a soundtrack of "Something in the Rain."

598
00:31:47,415 --> 00:31:48,744
She's my favorite singer.

599
00:31:48,745 --> 00:31:50,585
Is it a jazz-style song?

600
00:31:50,586 --> 00:31:53,885
It's a chanson. She's a French singer.

601
00:31:53,886 --> 00:31:56,425
She has a beautiful voice.

602
00:31:56,525 --> 00:31:58,985
- It suits you. - You have a unique style.

603
00:32:29,056 --> 00:32:30,856
- What? - It looks like someone's here.

604
00:32:31,126 --> 00:32:32,185
They're here.

605
00:32:35,195 --> 00:32:36,265
Who could it be?

606
00:32:38,296 --> 00:32:42,935
(The seventh participant, Yun Ha, arrives.)

607
00:32:44,806 --> 00:32:46,675
- Should we be standing? - Shall we stand up?

608
00:32:56,346 --> 00:32:58,515
- Hello. - Hello.

609
00:32:59,616 --> 00:33:01,714

00:33:01,715 --> 00:33:03,885
- Nice to meet you. - Hello.

611
00:33:03,886 --> 00:33:05,755
- You can sit wherever you want. - Okay.

612
00:33:05,995 --> 00:33:07,356
Which seat is not taken?

613
00:33:07,725 --> 00:33:09,425
- You must be cold. Take this. - Yes.

614
00:33:09,525 --> 00:33:10,965
Thank you.

615
00:33:12,296 --> 00:33:13,296
Here.

616
00:33:15,366 --> 00:33:16,405
Lovely to meet you.

617
00:33:16,406 --> 00:33:19,036

618
00:33:19,975 --> 00:33:21,306
- Hello. - Hello.

619
00:33:21,935 --> 00:33:23,704
What's your name?

My name is Yun Ha.

621
00:33:24,846 --> 00:33:26,116
- Yun Ha? - Yes.

622
00:33:26,475 --> 00:33:27,546
Yun Ha.

623
00:33:28,745 --> 00:33:30,646

My name is Cheol Hyeon.

626
00:33:35,755 --> 00:33:37,885
- Cheol Hyeon? - Yes.

627
00:33:37,886 --> 00:33:40,355
- And... - I'm Mr. Jung Sub.

628
00:33:40,356 --> 00:33:41,755
- Mr. Jung Sub? - Yes.

629
00:33:42,156 --> 00:33:43,424
- I mean... - Mr. Jung Sub?

630
00:33:43,425 --> 00:33:45,325
- Mr. Jung Sub? - Mr. Jung Sub?

631
00:33:45,326 --> 00:33:46,366
That's weird.

632
00:33:46,796 --> 00:33:47,835
They could be brother and sister.

633
00:33:47,836 --> 00:33:48,895
Right.

634
00:33:48,896 --> 00:33:50,535
- I have a feeling. - She looks like him.

635
00:33:50,536 --> 00:33:53,335
But her nose looks similar to Jae Hyung's.

636
00:33:53,336 --> 00:33:54,376
- Right? - Yes.

637
00:33:55,505 --> 00:33:56,806

00:33:58,706 --> 00:34:01,015

- It's good to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

644
00:34:12,525 --> 00:34:15,394
- What was our usual question? - Their MBTI types.

645
00:34:15,395 --> 00:34:16,725

- I'm an ESTP. - ESTP?

647
00:34:18,465 --> 00:34:20,465
- You're a T. - Yes.

648
00:34:21,235 --> 00:34:23,464
- You're the only P. - The only spontaneous type.

649
00:34:23,465 --> 00:34:25,135
- Really? - Yes.

650
00:34:25,136 --> 00:34:26,234
- All of you are Js? - We're all Js.

651
00:34:26,235 --> 00:34:27,505
It'll be hard for you.

652
00:34:29,706 --> 00:34:32,275
- I'll be with extreme planners. - Goodness.

653
00:34:32,846 --> 00:34:35,076
What are your MBTI types?

654
00:34:36,016 --> 00:34:38,545
I'm an ENTJ.

655
00:34:39,616 --> 00:34:40,886
I'm an ENTJ too.

656
00:34:41,916 --> 00:34:44,156
- I'm also an ENTJ. - What?

657
00:34:45,355 --> 00:34:48,624
- That's required for the men here. - If we ask the last person...

658
00:34:48,625 --> 00:34:49,894
whether he's an ENTJ, he'll say yes.

659
00:34:49,895 --> 00:34:51,725
- It's a gathering of ENTJs. - Yes.

660
00:34:51,726 --> 00:34:53,666
- It's interesting. - That's why I sense bromance here.

661
00:34:54,366 --> 00:34:56,835
(Darkness has fallen in the evening.)

662
00:34:58,766 --> 00:35:00,906
(One man is coming.)

663
00:35:41,715 --> 00:35:42,715
It looks like he's here.

664
00:35:43,616 --> 00:35:44,846
- He's here. - Finally.

665
00:35:47,456 --> 00:35:48,456
What would he be like?

666
00:35:48,457 --> 00:35:49,625
- Let's see. - I know.

667
00:35:55,125 --> 00:35:59,125

00:36:09,335 --> 00:36:12,274
- Hello. - Hello.

669
00:36:12,275 --> 00:36:13,445

671
00:36:16,016 --> 00:36:18,016
- I have no idea. - Yun Ha's brother.

672
00:36:18,416 --> 00:36:19,984
He looks like Cho A too.

673
00:36:19,985 --> 00:36:21,484
- He looks like Cho A. - Yes.

674
00:36:21,485 --> 00:36:23,754
- He looks like Jay Park. - Right.

675
00:36:23,755 --> 00:36:25,255
Yes. He indeed looks like Jay Park.

676
00:36:25,456 --> 00:36:26,524
- Hello. - Hello.

677
00:36:26,525 --> 00:36:27,826
What's your MBTI type?

678
00:36:28,425 --> 00:36:29,464
Me?

679
00:36:29,465 --> 00:36:30,925
I am an ENFTJ.

680
00:36:31,065 --> 00:36:32,124
- What? - What?

681
00:36:32,125 --> 00:36:34,294

682
00:36:34,295 --> 00:36:36,604
- ENTFJ? - I get both ENFJ and ENTJ.

683
00:36:36,605 --> 00:36:38,635
- Can you choose between them? - Me?

684
00:36:38,636 --> 00:36:39,935
I choose T, then. I'm an ENTJ.

685
00:36:39,936 --> 00:36:41,004
- It's incredible. - I'm a thinker.

686
00:36:41,005 --> 00:36:42,076
It's so interesting.

687
00:36:42,136 --> 00:36:43,576
- Yes. - It's amazing.

688
00:36:44,045 --> 00:36:45,475
You can sit wherever you want.

689
00:36:45,476 --> 00:36:46,515
- Where can I sit? - A little...

690
00:36:46,516 --> 00:36:47,516
- Thank you. - Sure.

691
00:36:48,375 --> 00:36:49,644
- You must be cold. - He seems really cold.

692
00:36:49,645 --> 00:36:51,015
It was colder than I thought outside.

693
00:36:51,016 --> 00:36:52,544
Jae Hyung, you forgot about this.

694
00:36:52,545 --> 00:36:53,616
Thank you.

695
00:37:06,596 --> 00:37:07,794

00:37:36,925 --> 00:37:38,665
Anyway, glad to meet you all.

712
00:37:38,666 --> 00:37:40,995
- Nice to meet you. - Happy to meet you.

713
00:37:40,996 --> 00:37:42,096
What kind of food do you like?

714
00:37:42,195 --> 00:37:43,205
- Me? - Yes.

715
00:37:43,206 --> 00:37:46,576
I like chicken dishes maybe because I eat them a lot.

716
00:37:47,076 --> 00:37:49,076
I like all chicken dishes. I also like fried chicken.

717
00:37:49,175 --> 00:37:50,774
You like working out, right?

718
00:37:50,775 --> 00:37:52,916
- Yes, I do. - I can tell.

719
00:37:53,346 --> 00:37:55,915
So I always study...

720
00:37:55,916 --> 00:37:58,544
how to enjoy chicken breast.

721
00:37:58,545 --> 00:38:01,286
- You're a researcher. - Yes. A chicken researcher.

722
00:38:02,116 --> 00:38:03,925
- Is that so? - A researcher?

723
00:38:05,125 --> 00:38:06,525
I'm also wearing a color similar to chicken today.

724
00:38:09,425 --> 00:38:11,064
I wanted to look like boiled chicken.

725
00:38:11,065 --> 00:38:13,065
I can see that. A seasoned chicken.

726
00:38:13,366 --> 00:38:16,305
If you want some chicken breast,

727
00:38:16,306 --> 00:38:19,504
I'll make you some later.

728
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:21,274
I think he will really love it.

729
00:38:21,275 --> 00:38:22,604
He said he did weight training.

730
00:38:22,605 --> 00:38:24,445
- That's great. - Well...

731
00:38:25,105 --> 00:38:28,115
I love your arms.

732
00:38:28,116 --> 00:38:30,785
- He just scanned me quickly. - Yes.

733
00:38:30,786 --> 00:38:33,314
He took a quick scan.

734
00:38:33,315 --> 00:38:35,315
(How do you like moving in here?)

735
00:38:35,616 --> 00:38:38,156
Jae Hyung is really good-looking.

736
00:38:38,255 --> 00:38:40,595
How could you think of putting me...

737
00:38:40,596 --> 00:38:43,465
with someone like him in the same place?

738
00:38:45,195 --> 00:38:47,835
The next man who came in was Cheol Hyeon.

739
00:38:48,166 --> 00:38:50,866
And Cheol Hyeon was so stylish.

740
00:38:51,206 --> 00:38:53,335
His hairstyle reminded me of Jannabi.

741
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:55,976
He gives off a dreamy vibe.

742
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:58,105
He was really cool too.

743
00:38:58,576 --> 00:39:01,246
And the last man, Yong Woo.

744
00:39:03,186 --> 00:39:06,985
I felt devastated.

745
00:39:07,815 --> 00:39:10,484
How did you only choose...

746
00:39:10,485 --> 00:39:13,096
these tall, handsome men?

747
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:17,226
How should I survive here?

748
00:39:18,525 --> 00:39:21,395
Lots of thoughts and emotions crossed my mind.

749
00:39:21,766 --> 00:39:24,366
I had mixed feelings.

750
00:39:25,206 --> 00:39:27,636
When I arrived, my sibling was there.

751
00:39:28,105 --> 00:39:31,275
I tried to avoid making eye contact with her.

752
00:39:31,605 --> 00:39:33,375
I tried hard not to laugh.

753
00:39:34,145 --> 00:39:36,945
How do I put this? "The Truman Show?"

754
00:39:37,215 --> 00:39:39,186
It felt like that a little. "Does everyone know about us,"

755
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:41,315
"and am I the only one trying to hide my identity?"

756
00:39:41,715 --> 00:39:44,955
I tried my best to act.

757
00:39:44,956 --> 00:39:46,525
I don't know if I did well.

758
00:39:47,355 --> 00:39:50,165
It was so good to see him among the strangers.

759
00:39:50,166 --> 00:39:52,826
Since he was the only person I could rely on.

760
00:39:53,136 --> 00:39:54,536
"This is why we're family."

761
00:39:55,395 --> 00:39:57,266
That's what I thought.

762
00:39:57,936 --> 00:39:59,305
It was so hard for me.

763
00:39:59,306 --> 00:40:03,604
I thought my sister and I had a lot in common.

764
00:40:03,605 --> 00:40:05,105
We have the same eyes and nose.

765
00:40:05,206 --> 00:40:07,246
I thought they might figure us out based on our looks.

766
00:40:07,715 --> 00:40:11,585
My brother is reading the room...

767
00:40:12,186 --> 00:40:14,016
and adapting to the new environment.

768
00:40:14,585 --> 00:40:17,085
Gosh. My sister looked the prettiest.

769
00:40:18,286 --> 00:40:19,895
I felt proud.

770
00:40:22,925 --> 00:40:25,266
- Really? - "My sister is the prettiest?"

771
00:40:25,465 --> 00:40:27,334
I just got what that meant.

772
00:40:27,335 --> 00:40:29,135
- Make us understand. - He'd been seeing her,

773
00:40:29,136 --> 00:40:31,535
and she tried to look the prettiest that day.

774
00:40:31,536 --> 00:40:33,806
She looked completely different before.

775
00:40:34,335 --> 00:40:35,335
Now that he sees her here,

776
00:40:35,336 --> 00:40:37,405
- he's like, "Who are you?" - How about Patricia?

777
00:40:37,406 --> 00:40:39,004
Be honest. I look the same, right?

778
00:40:39,005 --> 00:40:40,544
But if she dolls herself up,

779
00:40:40,545 --> 00:40:43,116
I might think, "How come she looks so pretty today?"

780
00:40:44,715 --> 00:40:47,585
Thinking again, my sister was the prettiest.

781
00:40:48,686 --> 00:40:51,125
Out of all the times I saw her, she looked the best today.

782
00:40:53,056 --> 00:40:56,394
"You've finally become a person."

783
00:40:56,395 --> 00:40:57,395
That's what I thought.

784
00:40:58,326 --> 00:41:00,295
Acting like she's a stranger?

785
00:41:00,965 --> 00:41:02,936
I think I'm doing a good job.

786
00:41:03,565 --> 00:41:05,335
I don't think people will notice.

787
00:41:11,976 --> 00:41:13,575
Shall we guess which ones are siblings?

788
00:41:13,576 --> 00:41:14,845
I matched them perfectly.

789
00:41:14,846 --> 00:41:15,945
- Really? - Tell us.

790
00:41:16,616 --> 00:41:17,685
Cheol Hyeon and Cho A.

791
00:41:17,686 --> 00:41:19,185
- Cheol Hyeon and Cho A. - Cheol Hyeon and Cho A.

792
00:41:19,186 --> 00:41:21,255
Cheol Hyeon and Cho A. Yong Woo and Ju Yeon.

793
00:41:21,786 --> 00:41:23,624
- Yong Woo and Ju Yeon. - Yong Woo and Ju Yeon.

794
00:41:23,625 --> 00:41:24,885
- Yong Woo and Ju Yeon. - Yes.

795
00:41:24,886 --> 00:41:27,425
- And Jung Sub and Se Seung. - Yes.

796
00:41:27,755 --> 00:41:28,794
Jung Sub and Se Seung.

797
00:41:28,795 --> 00:41:30,325
- Jae Hyung and Yun Ha. - Jae Hyung and Yun Ha.

798
00:41:30,326 --> 00:41:32,325
- What? Me too. - It's the same! Me too.

799
00:41:32,326 --> 00:41:34,234
- Really? - I matched them too.

800
00:41:34,235 --> 00:41:36,195
- This is good. - What if we got them right already?

801
00:41:36,406 --> 00:41:37,406
Who thinks differently?

802
00:41:37,407 --> 00:41:38,765
- I do. - Okay.

803
00:41:38,766 --> 00:41:41,206
First, Jae Hyung and Se Seung.

804
00:41:41,576 --> 00:41:43,504
- Jae Hyung and Se Seung? - Yes.

805
00:41:43,505 --> 00:41:45,044
- What? Really? - Jae Hyung and Se Seung.

806
00:41:45,045 --> 00:41:47,075
- What? - But Jae Hyung came in,

807
00:41:47,076 --> 00:41:48,246
and then Se Seung arrived.

808
00:41:48,346 --> 00:41:49,714
- Okay. - Really?

809
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:51,615
- Yes. That was a trick. - It was their big picture.

810
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:52,616
- Yes. - A big picture.

811
00:41:53,085 --> 00:41:54,285
- That's what I thought. - Who else?

812
00:41:54,286 --> 00:41:56,686
I only focused on those two.

813
00:41:56,855 --> 00:41:59,385
I'm not sure who Jae Hyung's sister is.

814
00:41:59,386 --> 00:42:01,455
Jae Hyung is the hardest.

815
00:42:01,456 --> 00:42:03,524
- Jae Hyung. - I wish I could see their nails.

816
00:42:03,525 --> 00:42:05,425
- Their nails. - I know.

817
00:42:13,576 --> 00:42:16,406
(Cheol Hyeon)

818
00:42:19,406 --> 00:42:21,076
(Ju Yeon)

819
00:42:24,045 --> 00:42:26,416
(Jung Sub)

820
00:42:28,556 --> 00:42:30,025
(Se Seung)

821
00:42:33,226 --> 00:42:34,656
(Cho A)

822
00:42:37,366 --> 00:42:39,266
(Yun Ha)

823
00:42:42,465 --> 00:42:43,965
(Jae Hyung)

824
00:42:47,275 --> 00:42:48,505
(Yong Woo)

825
00:42:58,045 --> 00:43:02,085
(My Sibling's Romance)

826
00:43:04,125 --> 00:43:08,895
(Episode 1, We Were Born as Brother and Sister.)

827
00:43:09,596 --> 00:43:10,795
What type of alcohol do you like?

828
00:43:11,326 --> 00:43:12,625
I like whiskey.

829
00:43:13,096 --> 00:43:14,495
- Whiskey. - Yes.

830
00:43:14,496 --> 00:43:15,894
Jung Sub likes whiskey too.

831
00:43:15,895 --> 00:43:17,866
How about we have whiskey and chicken breast sometime?

832
00:43:20,235 --> 00:43:21,605
My heart is fluttering already.

833
00:43:25,076 --> 00:43:28,245
If you need snacks to pair with it,

834
00:43:28,246 --> 00:43:29,916
- I can help you with it. - Okay.

835
00:43:31,315 --> 00:43:32,686
I'm looking forward to the coming days.

836
00:43:39,925 --> 00:43:41,225
We got a message.

837
00:43:41,226 --> 00:43:42,226
- Really? - Is that so?

838
00:43:44,166 --> 00:43:45,226
The first message.

839
00:43:46,096 --> 00:43:47,136
I've got it.

840
00:43:52,965 --> 00:43:54,435
(Welcome to the house.)

841
00:43:54,436 --> 00:43:58,706
(Send the name of the person your sibling will be drawn to.)

842
00:43:59,005 --> 00:44:01,175
"Send the name of the person your sibling will be drawn to."

843
00:44:02,715 --> 00:44:04,285
They will write that down?

844
00:44:04,286 --> 00:44:05,314
Well...

845
00:44:05,315 --> 00:44:07,485
The person that you think your sibling will find attractive?

846
00:44:08,715 --> 00:44:10,754
- They guess their sibling's type. - Right.

847
00:44:10,755 --> 00:44:12,754
- Right. - Since they're siblings,

848
00:44:12,755 --> 00:44:14,955
they must know what type of person their sibling is drawn to.

849
00:44:14,956 --> 00:44:16,495
They know about it a little.

850
00:44:16,496 --> 00:44:18,425
This is fun. It's refreshing.

851
00:44:18,525 --> 00:44:22,265
Right. What's interesting about this vote is...

852
00:44:22,266 --> 00:44:24,464
that you're not voting for the other gender.

853
00:44:24,465 --> 00:44:26,036
- You're voting for your gender. - A popularity vote.

854
00:44:26,136 --> 00:44:28,774
- That's right. - Someone your sibling might like...

855
00:44:28,775 --> 00:44:30,004
and you also like.

856
00:44:30,005 --> 00:44:31,144
- That's true. - Right.

857
00:44:31,145 --> 00:44:32,205
It's a true popularity vote.

858
00:44:32,206 --> 00:44:33,675
Yes. It's interesting.

859
00:44:34,675 --> 00:44:36,846
It was so much fun.

860
00:44:37,886 --> 00:44:40,314
It was really fun.

861
00:44:40,315 --> 00:44:42,155
I wasn't voting for the person I liked.

862
00:44:42,156 --> 00:44:43,286
I was choosing someone that my sibling might like.

863
00:44:44,125 --> 00:44:45,156
It was new.

864
00:44:45,656 --> 00:44:48,056
It didn't take that long...

865
00:44:48,326 --> 00:44:49,755
before I made my decision, though.

866
00:44:51,596 --> 00:44:53,894
I was a little torn between these two.

867
00:44:53,895 --> 00:44:56,635
Se Seung seemed like every guy's type...

868
00:44:56,636 --> 00:44:59,865
because she was so ladylike.

869
00:44:59,866 --> 00:45:02,774
And Ju Yeon is the type...

870
00:45:02,775 --> 00:45:04,576
that my brother usually likes.

871
00:45:04,675 --> 00:45:07,445
I kept thinking about who to choose between the two.

872
00:45:12,416 --> 00:45:13,485
It's difficult.

873
00:45:14,715 --> 00:45:18,386
(Who is the person my sibling will be attracted to?)

874
00:45:20,456 --> 00:45:21,855
Did you all respond?

875
00:45:27,036 --> 00:45:28,036
Yes, it's been sent.

876
00:45:32,166 --> 00:45:35,775
What else did you guys talk about?

877
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:38,306
- What should I catch up on? - We talked about drinks and music.

878
00:45:38,806 --> 00:45:40,476
Anyone with an interesting music taste?

879
00:45:41,016 --> 00:45:43,584
- Interesting? - She likes French songs.

880
00:45:43,585 --> 00:45:45,545
French songs?

881
00:45:45,645 --> 00:45:48,354
If you listen to the song, it's not what you think.

882
00:45:48,355 --> 00:45:49,355
- Is that so? - Yes.

883
00:45:49,585 --> 00:45:51,185
- Can we hear it a little? - I know.

884
00:45:51,186 --> 00:45:52,855
- What? - Can you give us a peek?

885
00:45:53,656 --> 00:45:55,556
- Should she look it up now? - Are you asking her to sing it?

886
00:45:56,456 --> 00:45:58,496
- It's from "Eating in the Rain." - Right.

887
00:45:58,596 --> 00:45:59,996
- "Something in the Rain." - "Something in the Rain."

888
00:46:00,096 --> 00:46:01,735
- I'm hungry. - Me too.

889
00:46:02,335 --> 00:46:04,305
I'm so hungry.

890
00:46:04,306 --> 00:46:06,366
- "Something in the Rain." - The song is from that drama.

891
00:46:06,465 --> 00:46:07,476
It's a soundtrack.

892
00:46:09,206 --> 00:46:10,545
That's an interesting taste.

893
00:46:11,375 --> 00:46:14,275
Who was your favorite singer?

894
00:46:14,675 --> 00:46:16,214
Carla Bruni.

895
00:46:16,215 --> 00:46:17,444
- I like that song too. - Carla Bruni.

896
00:46:17,445 --> 00:46:18,445
- Isn't it good? - Yes.

897
00:46:18,446 --> 00:46:19,685
- I know the song. - Carla Bruni.

898
00:46:19,686 --> 00:46:21,115
I didn't know it was from that drama.

899
00:46:21,116 --> 00:46:22,485
I know the song.

900
00:46:23,186 --> 00:46:25,625
- Is she a French singer? - Yes.

901
00:46:26,125 --> 00:46:28,255
I heard she was the first lady of France.

902
00:46:30,295 --> 00:46:32,325
Yong Woo came last,

903
00:46:32,326 --> 00:46:33,865
so he wouldn't know much about us.

904
00:46:33,866 --> 00:46:35,194
- Yes. - Right?

905
00:46:35,195 --> 00:46:37,965
- Let me collect some information. - If you have questions, ask away.

906
00:46:38,636 --> 00:46:40,335
How did you fall in love with French songs?

907
00:46:41,005 --> 00:46:42,305
He got hooked on that word.

908
00:46:42,306 --> 00:46:46,075
I've never met anyone...

909
00:46:46,076 --> 00:46:47,874
- She's the first person? - who liked French songs before.

910
00:46:47,875 --> 00:46:48,976
But the French song is...

911
00:46:49,375 --> 00:46:50,785
- A model... - Just now...

912
00:46:50,786 --> 00:46:52,115
- What was it? - His face was like, "You?"

913
00:46:52,116 --> 00:46:54,314
Yes. He didn't look...

914
00:46:54,315 --> 00:46:56,215
like he was really curious just now.

915
00:46:56,315 --> 00:46:58,025
It was like, "That's ridiculous."

916
00:46:59,125 --> 00:47:02,056
"That's ridiculous. You like French songs?"

917
00:47:02,395 --> 00:47:04,266
"If you like French songs, who's your favorite singer?"

918
00:47:04,366 --> 00:47:05,794
- It was like this. - Right.

919
00:47:05,795 --> 00:47:07,194
- Sometimes, - Goodness.

920
00:47:07,195 --> 00:47:10,604
when people ask her what her hobby is,

921
00:47:10,605 --> 00:47:11,706
she says it's reading.

922
00:47:11,906 --> 00:47:12,906
But it's the truth.

923
00:47:12,907 --> 00:47:15,234
And I ask her this every time.

924
00:47:15,235 --> 00:47:17,945
I can't help asking, "What book did you read recently?"

925
00:47:18,545 --> 00:47:20,145
I think he had this kind of look in his eyes.

926
00:47:21,116 --> 00:47:23,585
It's not easy to work with him.

927
00:47:24,045 --> 00:47:26,144
He just had that look.

928
00:47:26,145 --> 00:47:27,855
How did you fall in love with French songs?

929
00:47:28,616 --> 00:47:29,814
He got hooked on that word.

930
00:47:29,815 --> 00:47:33,595
I've never met anyone...

931
00:47:33,596 --> 00:47:36,255
- She's the first person? - who liked French songs before.

932
00:47:36,355 --> 00:47:37,424
Right?

933
00:47:37,425 --> 00:47:40,025
- So it's like... - Yes.

934
00:47:40,136 --> 00:47:41,936
It's like jazz and...

935
00:47:42,436 --> 00:47:45,065
- It doesn't sound like a chanson. - Yes.

936
00:47:46,005 --> 00:47:48,806
I associate "chanson" with her face, rather than her name now.

937
00:47:49,875 --> 00:47:52,406
- It suits her for some reason. - I'll remember her by French songs.

938
00:47:53,715 --> 00:47:56,944
I think the singer is really pretty.

939
00:47:56,945 --> 00:47:59,346
Or should I say she's beautiful...

940
00:47:59,886 --> 00:48:01,656
by my standards?

941
00:48:02,616 --> 00:48:04,484
- The singer? - Yes, the singer.

942
00:48:04,485 --> 00:48:05,786
- She's so charming. - That's fascinating.

943
00:48:08,755 --> 00:48:11,226
We've got a message.

944
00:48:23,706 --> 00:48:26,274
(As Yong Woo and Se Seung received the most votes...)

945
00:48:26,275 --> 00:48:28,874
(as the people their siblings will be drawn to,)

946
00:48:28,875 --> 00:48:31,485
(they can choose their rooms first.)

947
00:48:32,346 --> 00:48:33,585
Yong Woo and Se Seung.

948
00:48:34,116 --> 00:48:35,555
They get to choose their rooms first.

949
00:48:35,556 --> 00:48:38,156
- This is crazy. - It comes with a small benefit.

950
00:48:38,326 --> 00:48:40,394
That's a good start.

951
00:48:40,395 --> 00:48:42,195
- They must feel so good. - I know.

952
00:48:43,425 --> 00:48:45,794
(Yong Woo and Se Seung received the most votes...)

953
00:48:45,795 --> 00:48:48,096
(as the people their siblings find attractive.)

954
00:48:55,275 --> 00:48:57,045
He was like, "Why isn't it me?"

955
00:48:57,945 --> 00:48:59,275
Don't you think so?

956
00:49:02,275 --> 00:49:05,714
It means you're acknowledged by someone of the same sex.

957
00:49:05,715 --> 00:49:08,214
Right. I think it'd make you feel good.

958
00:49:08,215 --> 00:49:10,285
- And you'd feel proud... - Right.

959
00:49:10,286 --> 00:49:11,326
in front of your sibling as well.

960
00:49:12,186 --> 00:49:13,495
So this is how it goes.

961
00:49:13,496 --> 00:49:17,025
This is how we choose a room.

962
00:49:22,266 --> 00:49:23,465
I have the right.

963
00:49:24,906 --> 00:49:26,036
It felt good.

964
00:49:26,306 --> 00:49:28,334
I was acknowledged by the men.

965
00:49:28,335 --> 00:49:29,476
It's amazing.

966
00:49:29,806 --> 00:49:31,206
Whatever the situation is.

967
00:49:32,406 --> 00:49:35,444
When my sibling was with someone,

968
00:49:35,445 --> 00:49:38,485
they looked good together.

969
00:49:38,715 --> 00:49:40,116
And it was Yong Woo.

970
00:49:40,456 --> 00:49:42,156
I thought she and Yong Woo...

971
00:49:43,016 --> 00:49:45,156
looked very good together.

972
00:49:46,056 --> 00:49:48,925
(They all want Yong Woo.)

973
00:49:51,425 --> 00:49:53,425
How can you send the message...

974
00:49:53,866 --> 00:49:56,465
in the cruelest way like that?

975
00:49:57,965 --> 00:49:59,536
- So this is how it goes. - I have the right.

976
00:50:00,835 --> 00:50:02,936
I picked Jung Sub.

977
00:50:03,275 --> 00:50:05,775
Her ideal type...

978
00:50:05,906 --> 00:50:08,815
is someone who looks like a kind and good-natured man.

979
00:50:09,315 --> 00:50:12,286
I thought Jung Sub was the closest to her type among them.

980
00:50:13,016 --> 00:50:16,155
I picked Jae Hyung.

981
00:50:16,156 --> 00:50:18,886
He looked like a K-pop singer to me.

982
00:50:19,226 --> 00:50:21,395
He might've caught her eyes at first.

983
00:50:21,556 --> 00:50:23,525
I picked Se Seung.

984
00:50:23,666 --> 00:50:25,295
It's based on her appearance.

985
00:50:25,565 --> 00:50:28,194
She's very pretty.

986
00:50:28,195 --> 00:50:30,136
She looked like a nice person as well.

987
00:50:30,366 --> 00:50:31,866
First of all, she's pretty.

988
00:50:33,065 --> 00:50:36,735
I thought he might've been attracted by Se Seung the most.

989
00:50:37,445 --> 00:50:39,105
I picked Cho A.

990
00:50:39,505 --> 00:50:41,345
She looks graceful.

991
00:50:41,346 --> 00:50:44,116
She gives off a similar vibe as Han Go Eun.

992
00:50:44,715 --> 00:50:49,015
Whenever I ask my sibling about his ideal type,

993
00:50:49,016 --> 00:50:51,585
he mentions Han Go Eun.

994
00:50:52,025 --> 00:50:55,124
Actually, I was torn between Yun Ha and Ju Yeon.

995
00:50:55,125 --> 00:50:58,795
But Yun Ha has a prettier smile.

996
00:50:59,965 --> 00:51:01,166
So I thought he would be attracted to her more.

997
00:51:03,936 --> 00:51:05,835
- Shall we check the room? - Finally.

998
00:51:05,936 --> 00:51:07,576
Let's go.

999
00:51:08,576 --> 00:51:10,306
- Shall we go? - Yes.

1000
00:51:11,775 --> 00:51:13,044
I really want to see the second floor.

1001
00:51:13,045 --> 00:51:14,045
The second floor.

1002
00:51:21,516 --> 00:51:22,815
There are a lot of paintings.

1003
00:51:26,886 --> 00:51:28,096
It's so pretty.

1004
00:51:28,125 --> 00:51:29,325
(Impressed)

1005
00:51:29,326 --> 00:51:31,366
The atmosphere is nice.

1006
00:51:33,065 --> 00:51:34,535
It's cozier, isn't it?

1007
00:51:34,536 --> 00:51:38,105
(4 rooms are facing one another on the cozy 2nd floor.)

1008
00:51:40,136 --> 00:51:43,536
- We can sit together here. - Oh, my.

1009
00:51:43,846 --> 00:51:45,076
It's so interesting.

1010
00:51:46,206 --> 00:51:47,315
Vinyl records.

1011
00:51:50,746 --> 00:51:54,186
(The living room on the 2nd floor)

1012
00:51:54,355 --> 00:51:55,916
It has a nice view as well.

1013
00:52:01,996 --> 00:52:04,266
This door is yellow.

1014
00:52:05,726 --> 00:52:08,865
(The first room)

1015
00:52:08,866 --> 00:52:10,036
This is amazing.

1016
00:52:12,206 --> 00:52:14,335
- It's so cute. - This room...

1017
00:52:15,175 --> 00:52:17,346
is very big.

1018
00:52:18,445 --> 00:52:21,545
(The second room)

1019
00:52:26,916 --> 00:52:28,616
I like this room.

1020
00:52:29,116 --> 00:52:30,525
This room is very nice.

1021
00:52:30,656 --> 00:52:32,726
- I like this room. - This is really nice.

1022
00:52:32,985 --> 00:52:35,995
- I want this room too. - I really want it.

1023
00:52:35,996 --> 00:52:37,465
Yes. This room is the biggest.

1024
00:52:37,695 --> 00:52:39,766
I think this room is very cozy.

1025
00:52:40,636 --> 00:52:43,636
(The third room)

1026
00:52:45,666 --> 00:52:47,875
This room is cute too.

1027
00:52:50,976 --> 00:52:52,805
(The last room is next to the stairs.)

1028
00:52:52,806 --> 00:52:54,045
So it feels like this.

1029
00:52:54,116 --> 00:52:56,415
(The fourth room)

1030
00:52:56,416 --> 00:52:57,585
It's nice.

1031
00:53:01,485 --> 00:53:03,855
Which room do you like?

1032
00:53:05,786 --> 00:53:07,354
Have you decided, Yong Woo?

1033
00:53:07,355 --> 00:53:09,124
Yes, I have.

1034
00:53:09,125 --> 00:53:10,194
- You have? - Yes.

1035
00:53:10,195 --> 00:53:11,225
- Which one is it? - Me?

1036
00:53:11,226 --> 00:53:12,766
I think you're right there.

1037
00:53:13,695 --> 00:53:15,835
Do we have the same opinion?

1038
00:53:15,895 --> 00:53:17,465
- What do we do? - We have the same opinion.

1039
00:53:17,605 --> 00:53:20,036
- What do we do then? - No way.

1040
00:53:20,266 --> 00:53:23,234
- Let's be fair. - Let's be fair.

1041
00:53:23,235 --> 00:53:24,706
Rock, paper, scissors.

1042
00:53:24,806 --> 00:53:25,945
- Rock, paper, scissors. - Rock, paper, scissors.

1043
00:53:26,076 --> 00:53:27,144
(Yong Woo wins.)

1044
00:53:27,145 --> 00:53:30,214
- Yong Woo won. - Okay. I'll choose this room then.

1045
00:53:30,215 --> 00:53:31,246
Okay.

1046
00:53:32,445 --> 00:53:33,985
I'll pick this room.

1047
00:53:35,315 --> 00:53:36,315
It's nice to meet you.

1048
00:53:36,316 --> 00:53:37,354
- Let's have a good time. - Yes.

1049
00:53:37,355 --> 00:53:38,625
- Let's have a good time. - Yes.

1050
00:53:39,025 --> 00:53:42,056
- Let's have a good time. - Yes. Let's have a good time.

1051
00:53:43,156 --> 00:53:44,225
- Rock, paper, scissors. - Rock, paper, scissors.

1052
00:53:44,226 --> 00:53:45,366
(They decide who is going to share the room with Se Seung.)

1053
00:53:46,465 --> 00:53:47,536
- It's automatic. - We're roommates.

1054
00:53:47,895 --> 00:53:49,794
- We're roommates. - We'll use this room then.

1055
00:53:49,795 --> 00:53:50,905
Let's use this room.

1056
00:53:50,906 --> 00:53:53,206
- It was decided immediately. - Good.

1057
00:53:53,406 --> 00:53:55,735
- Isn't this room nice and cozy too? - Yes.

1058
00:53:57,076 --> 00:53:59,076
Naturally, this is your room.

1059
00:53:59,346 --> 00:54:01,945
- It's not bad. - Right. I think it's nice.

1060
00:54:02,315 --> 00:54:03,545
Let's go.

1061
00:54:04,085 --> 00:54:06,045
- It's all decided then. - Yes.

1062
00:54:06,386 --> 00:54:08,314
Can I come by?

1063
00:54:08,315 --> 00:54:09,354
- Sure. - Of course, you can.

1064
00:54:09,355 --> 00:54:11,254
Let's exercise over there.

1065
00:54:11,255 --> 00:54:12,655
- It sounds good. - Here.

1066
00:54:12,656 --> 00:54:14,294
It must be so nice to use this room.

1067
00:54:14,295 --> 00:54:15,925
- We... - It's nice and big.

1068
00:54:16,195 --> 00:54:18,125
This room has two closets.

1069
00:54:18,666 --> 00:54:20,064
- Other rooms... - Is there just one?

1070
00:54:20,065 --> 00:54:21,695
- There's one in our room. - Really?

1071
00:54:23,766 --> 00:54:24,906
Over there.

1072
00:54:25,206 --> 00:54:27,976
This room is so nice. There are a lot of mirrors too.

1073
00:54:29,436 --> 00:54:33,645
I got to pick the room through a certain process.

1074
00:54:35,215 --> 00:54:37,214
At first, I just thought...

1075
00:54:37,215 --> 00:54:39,214
it was nice to use a big room.

1076
00:54:39,215 --> 00:54:40,215
But...

1077
00:54:46,686 --> 00:54:47,725
(He knocks on the door of Se Seung's room.)

1078
00:54:47,726 --> 00:54:50,326
- Are you here? There's no one? - There's no one inside.

1079
00:54:52,195 --> 00:54:53,895
Have you seen Se Seung?

1080
00:54:55,096 --> 00:54:56,435
- Yes? - Se Seung.

1081
00:54:56,436 --> 00:54:58,504
- I looked at the room. - Yes.

1082
00:54:58,505 --> 00:55:01,206
Since the ladies have more belongings,

1083
00:55:01,436 --> 00:55:04,044
would you like to move to the room if you're okay?

1084
00:55:04,045 --> 00:55:05,605
No, it's fine.

1085
00:55:06,145 --> 00:55:07,815
No. I really want you to take it.

1086
00:55:10,645 --> 00:55:12,585
- Oh, my gosh. What? - He has everything.

1087
00:55:12,985 --> 00:55:14,656
That's so sweet.

1088
00:55:15,016 --> 00:55:16,084
I'll refuse three times.

1089
00:55:16,085 --> 00:55:17,725
- No, it's fine. - I'm serious.

1090
00:55:17,726 --> 00:55:20,056
If you refuse one more time, I'll just use the room.

1091
00:55:20,226 --> 00:55:21,956
I'll take it thankfully then.

1092
00:55:23,496 --> 00:55:24,924
- Are you sure? - Thank you...

1093
00:55:24,925 --> 00:55:26,366
- for making me comfortable. - Thank you so much.

1094
00:55:26,496 --> 00:55:28,136
I'm happy that I won in rock, paper, scissors.

1095
00:55:29,096 --> 00:55:30,636
- That's so sweet of you. - No.

1096
00:55:31,605 --> 00:55:34,104
I thought they would need more space...

1097
00:55:34,105 --> 00:55:36,636
when they get ready and stuff.

1098
00:55:37,076 --> 00:55:39,346
Can we talk for a moment?

1099
00:55:39,675 --> 00:55:41,445
I won in rock, paper, scissors,

1100
00:55:41,576 --> 00:55:44,215
but thinking about it,

1101
00:55:44,616 --> 00:55:47,214
women need more space.

1102
00:55:47,215 --> 00:55:50,584
- Yes. - I thought it'd be nice to switch.

1103
00:55:50,585 --> 00:55:52,455
- Yes. - So I'm asking you first.

1104
00:55:52,456 --> 00:55:53,685
- I'm fine with it. Yes. - Are you okay with it?

1105
00:55:53,686 --> 00:55:54,695
You are?

1106
00:55:54,755 --> 00:55:58,424
Thankfully, when I told Jae Hyung about it,

1107
00:55:58,425 --> 00:56:00,835
he said it didn't matter at all.

1108
00:56:01,096 --> 00:56:04,105
So I told Se Seung that I'd like to switch the rooms.

1109
00:56:05,366 --> 00:56:07,305
Do you like it?

1110
00:56:07,306 --> 00:56:09,935
This room? The door is in a different color.

1111
00:56:09,936 --> 00:56:12,504
Right? I prepared something...

1112
00:56:12,505 --> 00:56:14,375
- that suits your personal color. - My personal color? That's right.

1113
00:56:14,545 --> 00:56:15,714
Thank you so much.

1114
00:56:15,715 --> 00:56:17,314
- You're very welcome. - Thank you.

1115
00:56:17,315 --> 00:56:19,415
- The color is matching. - I know.

1116
00:56:19,416 --> 00:56:20,416
- The color is... - You're right.

1117
00:56:20,417 --> 00:56:23,254
Yong Woo is wearing a matching color as well.

1118
00:56:23,255 --> 00:56:25,286
I know. This is nice.

1119
00:56:30,355 --> 00:56:31,424
Didn't you say...

1120
00:56:31,425 --> 00:56:32,865
- you liked Jannabi earlier? - Yes.

1121
00:56:32,866 --> 00:56:34,366
- Their record is here. - Really?

1122
00:56:35,295 --> 00:56:36,295
No way.

1123
00:56:44,806 --> 00:56:48,275
Cho A told me about Jannabi.

1124
00:56:48,375 --> 00:56:50,145
I was thankful.

1125
00:56:50,215 --> 00:56:51,945
Because she remembered it.

1126
00:56:53,645 --> 00:56:57,656
She was sweet.

1127
00:57:04,226 --> 00:57:05,625
- I love it. - This is amazing.

1128
00:57:08,395 --> 00:57:09,666
Slowly.

1129
00:57:10,266 --> 00:57:11,536
It's fascinating.

1130
00:57:13,735 --> 00:57:15,235
- I like it. - This is nice.

1131
00:57:19,605 --> 00:57:22,746
(A letter has arrived.)

1132
00:57:23,175 --> 00:57:25,246
(Ringing)

1133
00:57:25,686 --> 00:57:26,885
Should we go?

1134
00:57:26,886 --> 00:57:28,255
I think so.

1135
00:57:28,516 --> 00:57:29,985
- What is it? - Are they going to tell us to eat?

1136
00:57:30,286 --> 00:57:32,656
(Se Seung is hungry.)

1137
00:57:33,085 --> 00:57:34,625
Who is it?

1138
00:57:37,525 --> 00:57:38,565
(Oh, my)

1139
00:57:41,735 --> 00:57:43,435
- Something has arrived. - Something has arrived.

1140
00:57:43,436 --> 00:57:45,335
- What are these? - I brought these...

1141
00:57:46,136 --> 00:57:48,005
- to throw them away. - Something has arrived.

1142
00:57:48,136 --> 00:57:49,504
- Something has arrived. - Something has arrived.

1143
00:57:49,505 --> 00:57:50,846
- Something has arrived? - What is it?

1144
00:57:50,976 --> 00:57:53,745
(What's written in the first letter?)

1145
00:57:53,746 --> 00:57:54,815
I'm nervous.

1146
00:57:55,476 --> 00:57:56,576
My heart is beating.

1147
00:57:57,485 --> 00:57:58,516
What is it?

1148
00:58:02,215 --> 00:58:03,286
- Wait. - What is it?

1149
00:58:03,355 --> 00:58:04,755
- Read it for us. - Let me read it.

1150
00:58:05,125 --> 00:58:07,956
"Your first date is Cupid Date."

1151
00:58:08,556 --> 00:58:11,225
"Ladies, please go back to your room..."

1152
00:58:11,226 --> 00:58:14,865
"to write a message to ask someone out on the enclosed note..."

1153
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:18,305
"and give it to the woman who is expected to be his sibling..."

1154
00:58:18,306 --> 00:58:19,635
"in secret."

1155
00:58:19,636 --> 00:58:22,076
"Don't write the name of the addressee and the addresser.

1156
00:58:24,005 --> 00:58:25,544
(Your first date is Cupid Date.)

1157
00:58:25,545 --> 00:58:27,044
(Ladies, please go back to your room to write a message...)

1158
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:28,345
(to ask someone out on the enclosed note...)

1159
00:58:28,346 --> 00:58:29,576
(and give it to the woman expected to be his sibling in secret.)

1160
00:58:30,016 --> 00:58:31,644
- "Write a message on the note." - "Write a message on the note."

1161
00:58:31,645 --> 00:58:32,645
What?

1162
00:58:32,645 --> 00:58:33,645
(They give the note to the sibling of the man they're interested in.)

1163
00:58:33,646 --> 00:58:36,156
- They will write a message. - They should make a guess too.

1164
00:58:36,255 --> 00:58:37,686
It's a guess.

1165
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:39,124
- Yes. - Right?

1166
00:58:39,125 --> 00:58:42,155
"Give it to your sibling."

1167
00:58:42,156 --> 00:58:44,524
And you give it to someone you believe to be his sibling.

1168
00:58:44,525 --> 00:58:45,525
- I got it. - But she may not be the sibling...

1169
00:58:45,526 --> 00:58:46,564
of the guy.

1170
00:58:46,565 --> 00:58:48,365
Then she'll give it to her sibling, which is a different guy.

1171
00:58:48,366 --> 00:58:49,595
- I got it. - So...

1172
00:58:49,596 --> 00:58:51,435
guessing the sibling...

1173
00:58:51,436 --> 00:58:52,835
- is very important here. - It's important.

1174
00:58:53,166 --> 00:58:54,705
You should make a good guess.

1175
00:58:54,706 --> 00:58:56,005
- That's the first step. - You're right.

1176
00:58:56,235 --> 00:58:57,375
I'm nervous.

1177
00:59:03,616 --> 00:59:06,346
- This is hard. Wait. - This is hard.

1178
00:59:06,516 --> 00:59:09,555
So the women should give the note...

1179
00:59:09,556 --> 00:59:13,354
to the person who they think is the sibling...

1180
00:59:13,355 --> 00:59:16,794
- of the guy... - The one they think is the sibling.

1181
00:59:16,795 --> 00:59:19,394
- So you might be wrong. - they want to date.

1182
00:59:19,395 --> 00:59:21,136
- I think you'd be wrong at first. - You're probably wrong.

1183
00:59:21,295 --> 00:59:22,795
I think the chances are very low.

1184
00:59:23,065 --> 00:59:25,965
You don't know the addressee and the addresser.

1185
00:59:26,065 --> 00:59:30,075
How can you send the note to someone they want?

1186
00:59:30,076 --> 00:59:33,774
It might be delivered to the wrong person.

1187
00:59:33,775 --> 00:59:36,576
Even if they go out on a date,

1188
00:59:36,775 --> 00:59:39,745
you might go out with someone you don't want.

1189
00:59:39,746 --> 00:59:42,714
(Do you think the others noticed your sibling?)

1190
00:59:42,715 --> 00:59:44,254
I'm not sure.

1191
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:46,726
I don't think they'd think we're siblings.

1192
00:59:46,956 --> 00:59:49,525
Don't we give off different vibes?

1193
00:59:49,556 --> 00:59:52,165
I think people would be confused.

1194
00:59:52,166 --> 00:59:56,536
I thought anyone would be able to tell that we're siblings.

1195
00:59:57,036 --> 00:59:59,005
But it might not be the case.

1196
00:59:59,105 --> 01:00:00,536
That's what I thought.

1197
01:00:01,235 --> 01:00:02,674
- This is so fun. - Is...

1198
01:00:02,675 --> 01:00:04,346
there anyone who doesn't understand?

1199
01:00:04,545 --> 01:00:06,775
- Can you repeat it just once? - I didn't get it either.

1200
01:00:07,076 --> 01:00:10,416
I wanted someone to say that they didn't get it.

1201
01:00:11,746 --> 01:00:13,115
"Go back to your room..."

1202
01:00:13,116 --> 01:00:14,686
- "and write a message..." - I got it.

1203
01:00:14,886 --> 01:00:16,116
- Shall we go back? - I got it.

1204
01:00:16,416 --> 01:00:17,885
You have a clear mind...

1205
01:00:17,886 --> 01:00:19,386
- This is... - probably because you do yoga.

1206
01:00:19,556 --> 01:00:22,325
Can you explain it to me?

1207
01:00:22,326 --> 01:00:24,194
If you got it, please explain it.

1208
01:00:24,195 --> 01:00:28,234
So let's say I want to go out with someone.

1209
01:00:28,235 --> 01:00:31,834
Then I should give the note to the woman...

1210
01:00:31,835 --> 01:00:33,306
I think is the sibling of the man.

1211
01:00:34,636 --> 01:00:37,575
- But in secret... - Then...

1212
01:00:37,576 --> 01:00:39,575
without the name of the addressee and the addresser.

1213
01:00:39,576 --> 01:00:42,444
So you should write the message to the guy, right?

1214
01:00:42,445 --> 01:00:44,345
"Would you like to go out with me?"

1215
01:00:44,346 --> 01:00:45,545
- I think so. - Yes.

1216
01:00:46,485 --> 01:00:48,085
- This is really fun. - This would be fun.

1217
01:00:48,886 --> 01:00:50,754
Honestly, I was curious.

1218
01:00:50,755 --> 01:00:54,795
Because it will tell us about our image on the first day.

1219
01:00:55,125 --> 01:00:57,565
I was curious about the result.

1220
01:00:58,065 --> 01:01:01,436
I did think I might receive...

1221
01:01:01,596 --> 01:01:03,136
at least one note.

1222
01:01:03,465 --> 01:01:05,265
I wanted...

1223
01:01:05,266 --> 01:01:08,576
to receive a note from Cho A.

1224
01:01:09,375 --> 01:01:11,706
He's definitely interested in her.

1225
01:01:11,846 --> 01:01:15,246
So they're not siblings.

1226
01:01:16,375 --> 01:01:18,516
It made my heart flutter.

1227
01:01:18,645 --> 01:01:21,715
And I wanted to make a good choice.

1228
01:01:22,085 --> 01:01:24,786
It was absolutely thrilling.

1229
01:01:26,056 --> 01:01:27,225
(Yun Ha)

1230
01:01:27,226 --> 01:01:28,255
This is fun.

1231
01:01:29,125 --> 01:01:30,155
Give me a note.

1232
01:01:30,156 --> 01:01:31,325
I'll give you a note.

1233
01:01:31,326 --> 01:01:33,295
- Yes. - The note is like...

1234
01:01:33,525 --> 01:01:34,835
- Cupid. - It's cute.

1235
01:01:34,996 --> 01:01:35,996
- It's cute. - It's so cute.

1236
01:01:35,997 --> 01:01:37,666
(Cheol Hyeon still didn't understand.)

1237
01:01:37,806 --> 01:01:38,865
(Cheol Hyeon)

1238
01:01:38,866 --> 01:01:39,965
I thought...

1239
01:01:40,065 --> 01:01:43,136
it was abstract and you could interpret it...

1240
01:01:43,636 --> 01:01:44,906
in different ways.

1241
01:01:45,206 --> 01:01:47,644
"Should we make a guess?"

1242
01:01:47,645 --> 01:01:49,545
I couldn't understand easily.

1243
01:01:50,375 --> 01:01:51,984
"Write a message to ask someone out..."

1244
01:01:51,985 --> 01:01:53,644
- "on the enclosed note..." - It might turn out to be like that.

1245
01:01:53,645 --> 01:01:56,085
"and give it to the woman expected to be his sibling."

1246
01:01:57,625 --> 01:01:58,855
- He's reading it again. - Since earlier, Cheol Hyeon...

1247
01:01:59,025 --> 01:02:01,225
It seemed very complicated to Cheol Hyeon.

1248
01:02:01,226 --> 01:02:02,226
(Jae Hyung)

1249
01:02:02,395 --> 01:02:04,325
I was also like, "What does it mean?" at first.

1250
01:02:04,326 --> 01:02:07,225
It felt like I was cracking a code.

1251
01:02:07,226 --> 01:02:09,235
Thanks to Cheol Hyeon who made it obvious that he didn't get it,

1252
01:02:09,565 --> 01:02:12,005
I could keep my dignity.

1253
01:02:12,766 --> 01:02:13,834
I got it.

1254
01:02:13,835 --> 01:02:17,076
As Ju Yeon explained it clearly, I completely understand it now.

1255
01:02:18,105 --> 01:02:19,575
So you don't write a message on the note.

1256
01:02:19,576 --> 01:02:21,274
You just write the name,

1257
01:02:21,275 --> 01:02:22,815
right?

1258
01:02:23,175 --> 01:02:24,214
- No. - You can do it if you want.

1259
01:02:24,215 --> 01:02:25,285
- Don't write the addressee... - Don't write the addressee...

1260
01:02:25,286 --> 01:02:26,345
- and the addresser. - and the addresser.

1261
01:02:26,346 --> 01:02:27,346
I see.

1262
01:02:27,347 --> 01:02:28,585
(Cheol Hyeon needs more time.)

1263
01:02:29,715 --> 01:02:31,425
(There's someone else who has been quiet.)

1264
01:02:32,186 --> 01:02:34,255
Yong Woo didn't get it either.

1265
01:02:36,056 --> 01:02:38,326
I have something to say.

1266
01:02:38,866 --> 01:02:40,025
Can you explain it to me again?

1267
01:02:41,936 --> 01:02:44,935
Do you still not understand how Cupid Date goes?

1268
01:02:44,936 --> 01:02:46,005
I'm sorry.

1269
01:02:46,465 --> 01:02:47,976
(Yong Woo couldn't understand for two days.)

1270
01:02:48,775 --> 01:02:50,674
(He doesn't get it.)

1271
01:02:50,675 --> 01:02:53,405
So you don't write the addressee and the addresser.

1272
01:02:53,406 --> 01:02:54,945
- You don't. - How do you know then?

1273
01:02:55,516 --> 01:02:56,575
- That's what I'm talking about. - What?

1274
01:02:56,576 --> 01:02:58,746
Let's say someone gave a note to me.

1275
01:02:59,045 --> 01:03:00,644
I'd know who gave it to me.

1276
01:03:00,645 --> 01:03:02,085
I become Cupid.

1277
01:03:02,516 --> 01:03:03,516
(Goosebumps)

1278
01:03:03,517 --> 01:03:04,556
- Oh, my gosh. - Gosh.

1279
01:03:04,755 --> 01:03:05,826
This is amazing.

1280
01:03:06,226 --> 01:03:07,625
I got chills just now.

1281
01:03:08,326 --> 01:03:10,425
- Let's go and write a message. - Yes.

1282
01:03:10,625 --> 01:03:11,895
- Okay. - Are you going back?

1283
01:03:11,996 --> 01:03:13,266
Cheol Hyeon still didn't get it.

1284
01:03:14,025 --> 01:03:15,465
I don't understand.

1285
01:03:15,565 --> 01:03:16,865
(Relating)

1286
01:03:16,866 --> 01:03:18,405
I felt deeply connected...

1287
01:03:18,406 --> 01:03:21,535
with Cheol Hyeon again.

1288
01:03:21,536 --> 01:03:23,305
I didn't know I would find someone...

1289
01:03:23,306 --> 01:03:25,906
I could mentally depend on in such a short period.

1290
01:03:27,675 --> 01:03:29,845
So the women will give the note to another woman.

1291
01:03:29,846 --> 01:03:31,084
- I need a pen. - They'll exchange the notes.

1292
01:03:31,085 --> 01:03:32,645
(Ringing)

1293
01:03:32,945 --> 01:03:34,956
- I'll go. - Okay.

1294
01:03:39,085 --> 01:03:42,395
(Something was delivered outside the front door.)

1295
01:03:44,425 --> 01:03:46,095
I don't think I can carry them all by myself.

1296
01:03:46,096 --> 01:03:47,525
- Please help me. - Is it perhaps...

1297
01:03:47,835 --> 01:03:48,935
Is it food?

1298
01:03:48,936 --> 01:03:50,695
Yes. Food has come, everyone.

1299
01:03:51,366 --> 01:03:52,865
(Containers with side dishes are stacked.)

1300
01:03:52,866 --> 01:03:53,866
I love it.

1301
01:03:54,266 --> 01:03:55,435
There are so many of them.

1302
01:03:55,436 --> 01:03:56,975
(Everyone is happy to see the side dishes.)

1303
01:03:56,976 --> 01:03:59,004
- Everyone ran to it. - This is so nice.

1304
01:03:59,005 --> 01:04:02,846
Our parents...

1305
01:04:03,016 --> 01:04:05,286
made those side dishes...

1306
01:04:05,445 --> 01:04:07,246
and sent them in the morning.

1307
01:04:07,416 --> 01:04:09,886
I was indeed happy to see it as my mom made it.

1308
01:04:10,485 --> 01:04:12,425
If you give it to me, I'll move it.

1309
01:04:12,925 --> 01:04:13,925
Gosh.

1310
01:04:16,525 --> 01:04:21,496
(Their parents prepared the side dishes before they moved in.)

1311
01:04:27,875 --> 01:04:30,535
When it boils like this, turn down the heat.

1312
01:04:30,536 --> 01:04:33,206
Simmer until it shrinks.

1313
01:04:33,406 --> 01:04:36,015
I will divide it evenly.

1314
01:04:36,016 --> 01:04:40,584
There's incredibly delicious tofu inside.

1315
01:04:40,585 --> 01:04:41,855
Don't forget that.

1316
01:04:41,985 --> 01:04:44,656
My parents gave us perilla leaves and salad.

1317
01:04:44,886 --> 01:04:48,226
We eat those dishes very often at home.

1318
01:04:48,425 --> 01:04:49,555
Salad...

1319
01:04:49,556 --> 01:04:52,064
is one of my mom's best dishes.

1320
01:04:52,065 --> 01:04:54,496
It's really good. It's crazy.

1321
01:04:54,636 --> 01:04:57,265
The moment you put it in your mouth, it melts.

1322
01:04:57,266 --> 01:05:00,834
Any food critic...

1323
01:05:00,835 --> 01:05:03,476
would give it 10 out of 10.

1324
01:05:03,636 --> 01:05:05,906
It's amazing.

1325
01:05:05,976 --> 01:05:07,575
(What side dish did your mother make?)

1326
01:05:07,576 --> 01:05:10,715
She made seaweed soup and braised kimchi and pork.

1327
01:05:10,945 --> 01:05:14,616
I'm going to drizzle perilla oil over it.

1328
01:05:15,656 --> 01:05:16,786
About two swirls.

1329
01:05:17,585 --> 01:05:18,885
- Two swirls of perilla oil. - Yes.

1330
01:05:18,886 --> 01:05:20,155
This is the braised kimchi,

1331
01:05:20,156 --> 01:05:22,924
which is my two children's favorite.

1332
01:05:22,925 --> 01:05:26,125
It's one of my favorite dishes.

1333
01:05:26,295 --> 01:05:27,565
Since my mom made it,

1334
01:05:28,395 --> 01:05:30,536
I wanted to enjoy it with others.

1335
01:05:31,136 --> 01:05:33,105
- There's a note too. - Yes.

1336
01:05:33,436 --> 01:05:35,005
- It also has a note? - Yes.

1337
01:05:36,335 --> 01:05:37,535
"Side dishes have arrived."

1338
01:05:37,536 --> 01:05:38,604
"Prepare dinner..."

1339
01:05:38,605 --> 01:05:40,104
- "and eat together." - "Eat together."

1340
01:05:40,105 --> 01:05:42,674
- "Don't say which dish is yours." - For now...

1341
01:05:42,675 --> 01:05:45,545
- Ladies, go back and write a note. - You want us to write first?

1342
01:05:45,715 --> 01:05:47,714
As for today, the guys will prepare dinner.

1343
01:05:47,715 --> 01:05:48,785
- We should do that. - Yes.

1344
01:05:48,786 --> 01:05:50,385
- That'd be better. - I got it.

1345
01:05:50,386 --> 01:05:51,555
- You plan everything out. - Thank you.

1346
01:05:51,556 --> 01:05:52,686
- Thank you. - It's good.

1347
01:05:53,125 --> 01:05:55,895
We can just write a note and exchange it ourselves.

1348
01:05:55,996 --> 01:05:57,226
- You're right. - Right?

1349
01:05:57,996 --> 01:05:59,465
(The women go to the 2nd floor to write a note.)

1350
01:06:00,965 --> 01:06:02,036
Well...

1351
01:06:02,666 --> 01:06:05,504
I think we should reheat the rice and soup.

1352
01:06:05,505 --> 01:06:07,706
I saw a meat dish earlier.

1353
01:06:07,906 --> 01:06:09,906
- Yes. - It's kimchi.

1354
01:06:10,735 --> 01:06:11,775
Well...

1355
01:06:12,976 --> 01:06:14,916
I think this is bulgogi.

1356
01:06:17,675 --> 01:06:19,545
(Everyone is moving busily.)

1357
01:06:22,916 --> 01:06:24,056
We have perilla leaves.

1358
01:06:24,186 --> 01:06:25,955
(Jung Sub's mother prepared the perilla leaves.)

1359
01:06:25,956 --> 01:06:27,456
I love perilla leaves.

1360
01:06:27,956 --> 01:06:29,795
- Me too. - I love it.

1361
01:06:30,656 --> 01:06:32,065
(Jae Hyung starts stir-frying the bulgogi.)

1362
01:06:33,726 --> 01:06:34,895
Look at the meat.

1363
01:06:35,036 --> 01:06:36,096
It looks good.

1364
01:06:36,295 --> 01:06:38,536
The smell drives me crazy.

1365
01:06:43,576 --> 01:06:46,476
My mother made beef bulgogi.

1366
01:06:47,576 --> 01:06:49,145
It boils when you stir-fry it.

1367
01:06:49,346 --> 01:06:52,116
- You should remove the foam. - Okay.

1368
01:06:52,346 --> 01:06:54,116
My family likes their food rather bland.

1369
01:06:54,215 --> 01:06:56,416
So my mom doesn't season the food much.

1370
01:06:56,585 --> 01:06:58,624
But she was cooking for other people this time.

1371
01:06:58,625 --> 01:07:00,124
So she told me to season it more...

1372
01:07:00,125 --> 01:07:02,726
when I cook it.

1373
01:07:02,855 --> 01:07:05,025
That's why I cooked it.

1374
01:07:06,496 --> 01:07:08,366
(He was on a special mission given by his mom.)

1375
01:07:10,335 --> 01:07:11,805
We can microwave the rice now, right?

1376
01:07:11,806 --> 01:07:13,504
I don't think it'll take long.

1377
01:07:13,505 --> 01:07:16,976
I think this is beef.

1378
01:07:17,206 --> 01:07:18,445
So it will cook quickly.

1379
01:07:19,076 --> 01:07:20,945
(Salad Ambassador gets closer to the salad.)

1380
01:07:21,145 --> 01:07:23,076
Is it shrimp? What is this?

1381
01:07:23,246 --> 01:07:24,545
- It's shrimp. - It's shrimp and...

1382
01:07:24,846 --> 01:07:26,245
- Scallop. - Scallop?

1383
01:07:26,246 --> 01:07:27,286
(He answers immediately.)

1384
01:07:27,545 --> 01:07:29,085
They prepared this with fresh ingredients.

1385
01:07:31,625 --> 01:07:33,725
- Is there anyone who can help? - I can help.

1386
01:07:33,726 --> 01:07:35,424
- The soup is almost boiling. - Yes.

1387
01:07:35,425 --> 01:07:37,395
Please take a look and turn it off.

1388
01:07:38,226 --> 01:07:39,595
- I think we should boil it more. - Shall we boil it more?

1389
01:07:39,596 --> 01:07:40,665
- We should boil it more. - Yes.

1390
01:07:40,666 --> 01:07:42,334
Seaweed soup is better when...

1391
01:07:42,335 --> 01:07:43,965
- The richer, the better. - Right.

1392
01:07:44,295 --> 01:07:45,505
I like seaweed soup.

1393
01:07:46,105 --> 01:07:47,766
- Yes. I like seaweed soup. - Yes.

1394
01:07:47,835 --> 01:07:50,005
They must've worked so hard for this.

1395
01:07:50,275 --> 01:07:51,604
- Yes. - They made a pot of it.

1396
01:07:51,605 --> 01:07:53,605
- I know. - It's a lot of soup.

1397
01:07:54,005 --> 01:07:56,245
- Do we have kimchi? - Yes, we do.

1398
01:07:56,246 --> 01:07:57,575
- We do? - Sour kimchi...

1399
01:07:57,576 --> 01:07:58,745
is in the fridge.

1400
01:07:58,746 --> 01:08:00,815
It's awesome. It's all good.

1401
01:08:02,556 --> 01:08:04,385
(He takes out the braised kimchi and pork his mother made.)

1402
01:08:06,385 --> 01:08:07,484
(Exclaiming)

1403
01:08:07,485 --> 01:08:09,554
It's kimchi and pork.

1404
01:08:09,555 --> 01:08:10,625
(Method acting)

1405
01:08:10,626 --> 01:08:12,996
- It's braised kimchi. - Wait.

1406
01:08:15,435 --> 01:08:17,536
- He's a good actor. - "I like seaweed soup."

1407
01:08:17,966 --> 01:08:20,065
Everyone is a good actor.

1408
01:08:20,935 --> 01:08:22,134
Shall we eat this tomorrow?

1409
01:08:22,135 --> 01:08:24,206
But isn't it better to eat it quickly?

1410
01:08:24,475 --> 01:08:25,705
- That's true. - Should we eat just one?

1411
01:08:25,706 --> 01:08:26,945
Is there another one?

1412
01:08:27,176 --> 01:08:28,774
There's another kimchi dish.

1413
01:08:28,775 --> 01:08:30,116
There is? Hold on.

1414
01:08:30,876 --> 01:08:32,116
I didn't see this.

1415
01:08:32,985 --> 01:08:34,085
- We have two of them. - It's the same dish.

1416
01:08:34,086 --> 01:08:35,255
For today,

1417
01:08:35,256 --> 01:08:36,455
- let's have that one and... - Should we just have kimchi?

1418
01:08:36,456 --> 01:08:37,555
Let's take out the kimchi only.

1419
01:08:38,126 --> 01:08:40,024
With sour kimchi, we can make ramyeon, kimchi stew,

1420
01:08:40,025 --> 01:08:41,656
kimchi jeon, and stir-fried kimchi.

1421
01:08:42,826 --> 01:08:45,094
(The living room on the 2nd floor)

1422
01:08:45,095 --> 01:08:46,594
Should we gather and write it?

1423
01:08:46,595 --> 01:08:47,665
Where should we write?

1424
01:08:47,666 --> 01:08:49,065
(The girls should write a Cupid Message.)

1425
01:08:49,265 --> 01:08:50,836
I'll write in my room.

1426
01:08:51,305 --> 01:08:52,435
I'll write here.

1427
01:08:54,265 --> 01:08:56,036
I want to write over there.

1428
01:08:56,805 --> 01:08:57,835
Okay.

1429
01:08:57,836 --> 01:08:58,945
(Yun Ha and Cho A are in the living room on the 2nd floor.)

1430
01:08:59,506 --> 01:09:01,376
(Ju Yeon is in her room.)

1431
01:09:03,746 --> 01:09:04,884
I won't look.

1432
01:09:04,885 --> 01:09:06,245
- I'm sorry. - It's fine.

1433
01:09:06,246 --> 01:09:07,984
I'll knock on the door before I come in from now on.

1434
01:09:07,985 --> 01:09:09,015
Yes.

1435
01:09:09,855 --> 01:09:11,586
(Se Seung sits in the room as well.)

1436
01:09:13,456 --> 01:09:14,796
My handwriting is really bad.

1437
01:09:14,956 --> 01:09:16,326
(She talked to herself loudly.)

1438
01:09:22,135 --> 01:09:23,265
Have you decided?

1439
01:09:24,235 --> 01:09:26,836
I'm guessing which one would be his sibling.

1440
01:09:27,605 --> 01:09:29,676
Writing a message is harder for me.

1441
01:09:30,076 --> 01:09:31,105
I see.

1442
01:09:35,515 --> 01:09:40,345
(Who will they deliver their first heartfelt message to?)

1443
01:09:42,216 --> 01:09:43,285
If they had liked someone,

1444
01:09:43,286 --> 01:09:45,655
they would've been thinking about it the whole time.

1445
01:09:45,656 --> 01:09:47,085
"Who is the sibling..."

1446
01:09:47,086 --> 01:09:48,524
- "of the guy I like?" - Right.

1447
01:09:48,525 --> 01:09:50,895
That's why the girls should get along well.

1448
01:09:51,025 --> 01:09:53,295
- Yes. She might be the sibling. - She might be the sibling...

1449
01:09:53,296 --> 01:09:54,496
- of someone they like. - Right.

1450
01:09:54,866 --> 01:09:55,935
That's true.

1451
01:10:04,475 --> 01:10:07,506
(Se Seung starts writing a note after thinking for a while.)

1452
01:10:08,376 --> 01:10:11,545
(Why do you want to give the note to that person?)

1453
01:10:11,546 --> 01:10:14,616
I think we have a similar sense.

1454
01:10:14,916 --> 01:10:16,786
A sense of humor.

1455
01:10:17,086 --> 01:10:19,256
I think we'll get along well based on our personality.

1456
01:10:19,885 --> 01:10:20,926
He was funny.

1457
01:10:23,826 --> 01:10:27,166
(Se Seung is the first one who wrote the note.)

1458
01:10:33,666 --> 01:10:38,036
(I think our personalities match. Let's have fun on our date.)

1459
01:10:41,815 --> 01:10:44,145
(She writes a few more words.)

1460
01:10:51,116 --> 01:10:56,756
(I hope you're the one I want to give this note to.)

1461
01:10:59,466 --> 01:11:01,126
- Let me know when you're done. - Okay.

1462
01:11:02,836 --> 01:11:04,265
(She politely sits with her back to her.)

1463
01:11:04,836 --> 01:11:07,135
(Meanwhile, Cho A and Yun Ha are still contemplating.)

1464
01:11:10,105 --> 01:11:12,046
(Cho A is thinking hard.)

1465
01:11:13,076 --> 01:11:15,275
(Not budging an inch)

1466
01:11:19,645 --> 01:11:22,185
(Cho A is a careful type.)

1467
01:11:23,355 --> 01:11:25,426
(She starts writing after contemplating for a long time.)

1468
01:11:29,855 --> 01:11:31,455
(After writing one sentence,)

1469
01:11:31,456 --> 01:11:34,166
(she's thinking again.)

1470
01:11:37,036 --> 01:11:38,836
(She writes again.)

1471
01:11:39,435 --> 01:11:42,275
(Who were you thinking while writing the note?)

1472
01:11:42,435 --> 01:11:44,006
Jung Sub.

1473
01:11:44,635 --> 01:11:45,645
Yes.

1474
01:11:45,746 --> 01:11:48,945
I'm an introvert.

1475
01:11:49,176 --> 01:11:51,376
And he also looked calm...

1476
01:11:51,685 --> 01:11:54,014
and dignified.

1477
01:11:54,015 --> 01:11:55,814
(I'm Jung Sub.)

1478
01:11:55,815 --> 01:11:56,884
"Jung Sub."

1479
01:11:56,885 --> 01:11:59,286
- Yes. - I felt a sense of kinship.

1480
01:11:59,385 --> 01:12:03,626
I think that's why he caught my eye at first.

1481
01:12:03,956 --> 01:12:05,595
I thought we would get each other.

1482
01:12:13,336 --> 01:12:14,875
(It's chilly. Would you like to have a cup of warm tea with me?)

1483
01:12:14,876 --> 01:12:18,945
(From Cho A to Jung Sub)

1484
01:12:19,105 --> 01:12:20,144
Is it her handwriting?

1485
01:12:20,145 --> 01:12:21,205
- Her handwriting is... - "Would you like a cup of tea?"

1486
01:12:21,206 --> 01:12:22,715
- Everyone's handwriting is good. - Her handwriting...

1487
01:12:22,716 --> 01:12:24,345
- makes my heart flutter. - I know.

1488
01:12:24,716 --> 01:12:26,344
- I like it. - She didn't write it in cursive.

1489
01:12:26,345 --> 01:12:27,716
The message made my heart flutter as well.

1490
01:12:29,786 --> 01:12:31,456
(Ju Yeon is contemplating as well.)

1491
01:12:38,195 --> 01:12:40,095
I was thinking about Cheol Hyeon while writing.

1492
01:12:41,366 --> 01:12:46,336
He talked to lighten up the atmosphere.

1493
01:12:46,506 --> 01:12:48,105
I liked that.

1494
01:12:48,506 --> 01:12:49,506
(I'm Cheol Hyeon.)

1495
01:12:50,506 --> 01:12:51,906
(I told you, didn't I?)

1496
01:12:52,345 --> 01:12:54,916
I think I would find another interesting charm of him...

1497
01:12:55,015 --> 01:12:58,515
when I talk to him personally.

1498
01:12:58,645 --> 01:12:59,945
That's why I picked him.

1499
01:13:01,086 --> 01:13:02,755
(She pauses for a moment.)

1500
01:13:02,756 --> 01:13:04,185
I contemplated when I was writing the note.

1501
01:13:04,286 --> 01:13:08,085
I wondered if I should think about Cheol Hyeon...

1502
01:13:08,086 --> 01:13:11,224
or his sibling while writing it.

1503
01:13:11,225 --> 01:13:14,996
Anyway, both of them could see it.

1504
01:13:15,095 --> 01:13:17,966
So I tried to write a message that was not too serious.

1505
01:13:22,706 --> 01:13:23,875
(From Ju Yeon to Cheol Hyeon: You worked hard on the first day!)

1506
01:13:23,876 --> 01:13:25,706
(Let's have fun and get to know each other. How about a restaurant?)

1507
01:13:26,906 --> 01:13:28,046
I'm done.

1508
01:13:28,475 --> 01:13:29,616
- Are you done? - Yes.

1509
01:13:30,416 --> 01:13:31,444
Oh, my.

1510
01:13:31,445 --> 01:13:33,885
It slips out easily. So I need to hold it tight.

1511
01:13:35,055 --> 01:13:36,786
(Laughing)

1512
01:13:37,685 --> 01:13:38,685
Are you done writing?

1513
01:13:39,185 --> 01:13:40,326
- Are you done? - Yes.

1514
01:13:40,626 --> 01:13:42,926
- I just kept it short. - Should we deliver them now?

1515
01:13:43,095 --> 01:13:45,264
- Yun Ha, are you done? - No.

1516
01:13:45,265 --> 01:13:47,594
- Take your time. - You're still writing.

1517
01:13:47,595 --> 01:13:49,764
Are you writing a long letter?

1518
01:13:49,765 --> 01:13:51,466
- No. - No?

1519
01:13:51,805 --> 01:13:53,434
- Not sure what to write? - It's not like that, at all.

1520
01:13:53,435 --> 01:13:54,805
I'm not a good writer.

1521
01:13:57,275 --> 01:14:00,104
I'm not sure how to write this.

1522
01:14:00,105 --> 01:14:03,344
Asking someone out on a date...

1523
01:14:03,345 --> 01:14:05,684
is something I've never done before.

1524
01:14:05,685 --> 01:14:07,786
To be honest, I felt lost.

1525
01:14:09,485 --> 01:14:13,485
(Who did she think of while she felt lost?)

1526
01:14:21,595 --> 01:14:24,235
(After thinking for a long time, she starts writing.)

1527
01:14:24,866 --> 01:14:29,475
I was going to write to Yong Woo.

1528
01:14:29,735 --> 01:14:30,875
Nice to meet you.

1529
01:14:30,876 --> 01:14:33,006
He looks like he's a nice person.

1530
01:14:33,445 --> 01:14:34,775
My jacket is the color of chicken too.

1531
01:14:35,916 --> 01:14:36,916
I see.

1532
01:14:37,116 --> 01:14:38,814
Like boiled chicken.

1533
01:14:38,815 --> 01:14:39,985
"Boiled chicken."

1534
01:14:41,086 --> 01:14:43,854
He's funny when he talks,

1535
01:14:43,855 --> 01:14:46,554
and I like funny people.

1536
01:14:46,555 --> 01:14:49,225
So I developed feelings a little.

1537
01:14:52,225 --> 01:14:54,665
(From Yun Ha to Yong Woo)

1538
01:14:54,666 --> 01:14:56,635
(Thanks to you, today went well. Let's have fun here.)

1539
01:15:01,836 --> 01:15:04,774
- Yun Ha wrote to Yong Woo. - Yes.

1540
01:15:04,775 --> 01:15:07,175
- That means they aren't siblings. - Right.

1541
01:15:07,176 --> 01:15:09,274
- Right. - And who did Ju Yeon write to?

1542
01:15:09,275 --> 01:15:10,415
Cheol Hyeon, right?

1543
01:15:10,416 --> 01:15:12,415
- So it means they're not siblings. - Not siblings.

1544
01:15:12,416 --> 01:15:14,444
Cho A wrote to Jung Sub.

1545
01:15:14,445 --> 01:15:15,715
- They're not siblings. - They're not siblings.

1546
01:15:15,716 --> 01:15:17,955
Our speculations are being revealed to be true.

1547
01:15:17,956 --> 01:15:19,354
Right. Maybe we got everything right.

1548
01:15:19,355 --> 01:15:20,724
It's all being revealed one by one.

1549
01:15:20,725 --> 01:15:22,256
- Gosh. - It's unraveling.

1550
01:15:22,656 --> 01:15:24,695
What do you think is going to happen tomorrow?

1551
01:15:25,296 --> 01:15:27,394
What if we go on our first dates tomorrow?

1552
01:15:27,395 --> 01:15:29,094
Then... I think that is possible.

1553
01:15:29,095 --> 01:15:30,295
Cupid.

1554
01:15:30,296 --> 01:15:32,005
Do you want to get a lot of them?

1555
01:15:32,006 --> 01:15:33,764
- The letters? - Yes, the notes.

1556
01:15:33,765 --> 01:15:36,536
So like a lot of people are suspicious of you.

1557
01:15:36,876 --> 01:15:39,444
I want people to think...

1558
01:15:39,445 --> 01:15:41,774
I'm the sibling of the most popular guy.

1559
01:15:41,775 --> 01:15:42,916
I think that would be fun.

1560
01:15:43,116 --> 01:15:46,314
If that happens, as Cupid,

1561
01:15:46,315 --> 01:15:47,815
- Do a lot of work? - I'll have to...

1562
01:15:48,015 --> 01:15:49,216
Do I make the choice?

1563
01:15:49,416 --> 01:15:51,615
- Gosh. That's amazing. - Let's say I received several.

1564
01:15:51,616 --> 01:15:54,224
So then, you'd pick the one that you like.

1565
01:15:54,225 --> 01:15:56,756
Then I should have written my note better.

1566
01:15:57,926 --> 01:16:00,365
- Did everyone go downstairs? - Yes, come in.

1567
01:16:00,366 --> 01:16:01,665
- Did you finish? - Did they all leave?

1568
01:16:01,666 --> 01:16:02,934
Are we doing it here?

1569
01:16:02,935 --> 01:16:04,234
- Should we exchange notes here? - Here?

1570
01:16:04,235 --> 01:16:07,604
- Should we? - Are we allowed to do it publicly?

1571
01:16:07,605 --> 01:16:09,434
It didn't say we're supposed to deliver it in private, right?

1572
01:16:09,435 --> 01:16:10,505
Right.

1573
01:16:10,506 --> 01:16:11,774
(Deliver your note in private to the woman who you think is...)

1574
01:16:11,775 --> 01:16:14,005
(Deliver your note in private...)

1575
01:16:14,006 --> 01:16:15,815
(It seems like everyone forgot.)

1576
01:16:17,975 --> 01:16:20,616
(There's tension in the room.)

1577
01:16:22,756 --> 01:16:23,786
- Here. - Gosh.

1578
01:16:24,916 --> 01:16:26,855
- Me too. - Really?

1579
01:16:27,256 --> 01:16:28,855
- Me too. - Gosh.

1580
01:16:30,555 --> 01:16:32,895
(Ju Yeon got all the notes.)

1581
01:16:33,326 --> 01:16:35,394
- What's going on? - That's so cute, though.

1582
01:16:35,395 --> 01:16:38,064
Cho A must have thought...

1583
01:16:38,065 --> 01:16:40,265
- Ju Yeon and Jung Sub are siblings. - Right.

1584
01:16:40,466 --> 01:16:41,764
What's happening right now?

1585
01:16:41,765 --> 01:16:43,176
What if none of them...

1586
01:16:44,406 --> 01:16:45,475
- Here. - Gosh.

1587
01:16:46,645 --> 01:16:48,546
- Me too. - Really?

1588
01:16:48,845 --> 01:16:50,314
- Me too. - Gosh.

1589
01:16:50,315 --> 01:16:51,916
(She's shocked.)

1590
01:16:52,345 --> 01:16:53,786
- No way. - How is this possible?

1591
01:16:53,985 --> 01:16:55,256
"This isn't going to be easy."

1592
01:16:57,315 --> 01:16:59,385
"This game isn't going to be easy."

1593
01:17:00,156 --> 01:17:01,524
That's what I thought.

1594
01:17:01,525 --> 01:17:04,054
As expected, the person I think is charming...

1595
01:17:04,055 --> 01:17:05,796
is the one everyone else thinks is charming too.

1596
01:17:06,025 --> 01:17:08,595
(Why did you think Ju Yeon is Yong Woo's sibling?)

1597
01:17:08,895 --> 01:17:10,394
They have very similar eyes.

1598
01:17:10,395 --> 01:17:12,465
It doesn't seem that way at first,

1599
01:17:12,466 --> 01:17:14,565
The more you look at them, the more their eyes seem...

1600
01:17:14,735 --> 01:17:17,505
like they could be siblings.

1601
01:17:17,506 --> 01:17:18,645
That's what I think.

1602
01:17:18,845 --> 01:17:22,344
I thought he was Ju Yeon's brother,

1603
01:17:22,345 --> 01:17:23,616
so I gave mine to Ju Yeon.

1604
01:17:23,746 --> 01:17:25,884
They have similar images.

1605
01:17:25,885 --> 01:17:30,184
I felt like the two have similar personalities.

1606
01:17:30,185 --> 01:17:33,285
To be honest, I was a bit conflicted.

1607
01:17:33,286 --> 01:17:36,255
Appearance-wise, they don't seem like siblings.

1608
01:17:36,256 --> 01:17:39,394
Ju Yeon's personality goes well with mine,

1609
01:17:39,395 --> 01:17:43,094
so I guess I was hoping that...

1610
01:17:43,095 --> 01:17:45,235
she's his sibling.

1611
01:17:45,435 --> 01:17:47,434
I think everyone noticed.

1612
01:17:47,435 --> 01:17:49,005
They all gave it to me.

1613
01:17:49,006 --> 01:17:51,575
I got all three Cupid cards.

1614
01:17:51,576 --> 01:17:55,144
I think they all noticed who my sibling is and gave them to me.

1615
01:17:55,145 --> 01:17:57,444
As of right now, my sibling seems...

1616
01:17:57,445 --> 01:18:00,716
like the most popular person here.

1617
01:18:01,315 --> 01:18:02,485
And here's mine.

1618
01:18:03,456 --> 01:18:04,785
(Ju Yeon gave hers to Cho A.)

1619
01:18:04,786 --> 01:18:07,725
(Why do you think Cho A is Cheol Hyeon's sibling?)

1620
01:18:07,855 --> 01:18:11,354
The two of them feel similar somehow.

1621
01:18:11,355 --> 01:18:13,895
I feel like they both give off cold vibes.

1622
01:18:14,796 --> 01:18:18,665
They both feel like cold, good-looking people,

1623
01:18:18,666 --> 01:18:20,264
so I thought they could be siblings.

1624
01:18:20,265 --> 01:18:21,366
I didn't get any.

1625
01:18:22,635 --> 01:18:24,576
- Why am I kind of sad? - You're so funny.

1626
01:18:24,775 --> 01:18:26,205
Why do I feel sad, though?

1627
01:18:26,206 --> 01:18:27,246
There's none for you.

1628
01:18:28,206 --> 01:18:29,945
I'm sorry, but I have nothing for you.

1629
01:18:30,216 --> 01:18:33,384
I didn't feel sorry for him at all.

1630
01:18:33,385 --> 01:18:35,684
I was just disappointed that I didn't get any of the notes.

1631
01:18:35,685 --> 01:18:37,484
I felt like it could be very fun.

1632
01:18:37,485 --> 01:18:40,585
I don't think they'll know we're siblings.

1633
01:18:40,586 --> 01:18:42,225
Somebody must have written to him.

1634
01:18:43,926 --> 01:18:45,565
What do I do?

1635
01:18:46,666 --> 01:18:48,594
I was so sad.

1636
01:18:48,595 --> 01:18:50,366
I felt sorry for him.

1637
01:18:50,735 --> 01:18:52,934
How did I get all three of yours?

1638
01:18:52,935 --> 01:18:55,905
- That's amazing. - This is so fun.

1639
01:18:55,906 --> 01:18:58,076
What do you think is going to happen?

1640
01:18:58,275 --> 01:19:00,475
For now, this stays between us.

1641
01:19:00,775 --> 01:19:02,144
Just hold on to them.

1642
01:19:02,145 --> 01:19:03,774
I'll shuffle these.

1643
01:19:03,775 --> 01:19:07,644
I'll hide the notes somewhere I know.

1644
01:19:07,645 --> 01:19:09,055
It was so fun.

1645
01:19:09,916 --> 01:19:11,055
It was so fun.

1646
01:19:11,416 --> 01:19:14,184
It's insane. This is so fun.

1647
01:19:14,185 --> 01:19:15,825
- It sounds so fun. - I want to do it too.

1648
01:19:15,826 --> 01:19:17,224
I wanted to get all the notes.

1649
01:19:17,225 --> 01:19:19,265
I want to do it too.

1650
01:19:19,695 --> 01:19:21,895
- Let's do this. - We got this!

1651
01:19:22,635 --> 01:19:24,594
This is so fun.

1652
01:19:24,595 --> 01:19:26,134
- Somewhere only I know... - This is our secret.

1653
01:19:26,135 --> 01:19:28,234
I'll go hide these somewhere only I know.

1654
01:19:28,235 --> 01:19:29,274
Sounds good.

1655
01:19:29,275 --> 01:19:30,336
(Everyone gives her space.)

1656
01:19:31,135 --> 01:19:33,445
(She hides them deep inside the drawer.)

1657
01:19:35,145 --> 01:19:37,645
(Cho A hides it in her closet drawer too.)

1658
01:19:42,256 --> 01:19:43,984
Something smells good.

1659
01:19:43,985 --> 01:19:45,655
- Are you all done? - Do you need help? Yes.

1660
01:19:45,656 --> 01:19:46,926
We're all done.

1661
01:19:47,385 --> 01:19:48,995
- We're almost done. - You can do it tomorrow.

1662
01:19:48,996 --> 01:19:50,054
- It smells delicious. - All right.

1663
01:19:50,055 --> 01:19:51,095
You can do it tomorrow.

1664
01:19:51,956 --> 01:19:54,025
Thank you all for your efforts.

1665
01:19:55,065 --> 01:19:56,735
(Jae Hyung is about to cut the kimchi.)

1666
01:19:57,065 --> 01:19:59,234
You look so cool.

1667
01:19:59,235 --> 01:20:01,065
- Don't I? - You totally do.

1668
01:20:01,336 --> 01:20:03,376
- You look so cool. - You look so cool.

1669
01:20:03,576 --> 01:20:06,144
Apparently, this is sour kimchi.

1670
01:20:06,145 --> 01:20:07,274
- It is. - Yes, it's sour kimchi.

1671
01:20:07,275 --> 01:20:09,375
Then is there kimchi that isn't sour too?

1672
01:20:09,376 --> 01:20:10,745
I don't think there is.

1673
01:20:10,746 --> 01:20:13,985
But someone made braised kimchi.

1674
01:20:14,286 --> 01:20:16,555
There are braised kimchi and stir-fried kimchi.

1675
01:20:16,855 --> 01:20:19,655
- Braised kimchi. - Yong Woo, you're too obvious.

1676
01:20:19,656 --> 01:20:21,484
He's doing it again. Method acting.

1677
01:20:21,485 --> 01:20:24,224
He keeps obsessing over that braised kimchi.

1678
01:20:24,225 --> 01:20:26,195
Yong Woo loves his mom.

1679
01:20:27,195 --> 01:20:28,425
- He's such a good son. - It's so delicious,

1680
01:20:28,426 --> 01:20:30,035
so he just wants to brag about it.

1681
01:20:30,036 --> 01:20:31,565
It's because Yong Woo's a good son.

1682
01:20:31,765 --> 01:20:32,934
We can have it for breakfast.

1683
01:20:32,935 --> 01:20:34,104
We can have the stir-fried kimchi some other time.

1684
01:20:34,105 --> 01:20:35,234
- Gosh. - Goodness.

1685
01:20:35,235 --> 01:20:37,705
- It looks great for breakfast. - I'll put it away.

1686
01:20:37,706 --> 01:20:38,774
That looks amazing.

1687
01:20:38,775 --> 01:20:40,005
(He's satisfied.)

1688
01:20:40,006 --> 01:20:41,006
(Patting)

1689
01:20:42,046 --> 01:20:43,344
We have so many side dishes.

1690
01:20:43,345 --> 01:20:44,376
Let me just...

1691
01:20:45,616 --> 01:20:46,645
The person...

1692
01:20:47,445 --> 01:20:50,755
The person who made this told us to pour the sauce before we eat.

1693
01:20:50,756 --> 01:20:51,756
- Are you going to eat it? - Right.

1694
01:20:51,757 --> 01:20:54,826
(Wait! Before you eat, pour the sauce in the yellow container.)

1695
01:20:54,926 --> 01:20:56,425
Wait, be careful.

1696
01:20:56,426 --> 01:20:58,554
Be careful, it's going to drip.

1697
01:20:58,555 --> 01:20:59,996
(Every drop of the salad sauce matters.)

1698
01:21:02,065 --> 01:21:04,365
Gosh. What a feast.

1699
01:21:04,366 --> 01:21:05,635
Right. Gosh.

1700
01:21:07,265 --> 01:21:11,775
(They're having a plentiful meal thanks to the parents' side dishes.)

1701
01:21:15,676 --> 01:21:17,444
- Shall we start eating? - Yes.

1702
01:21:17,445 --> 01:21:18,715
- Yes. - Let's eat.

1703
01:21:18,716 --> 01:21:19,884
(The first dinner)

1704
01:21:19,885 --> 01:21:21,944
- Let's eat. - Thank you for the food.

1705
01:21:21,945 --> 01:21:23,785
- Enjoy. - Thank you for the food.

1706
01:21:23,786 --> 01:21:25,115
- Enjoy. - Enjoy.

1707
01:21:25,116 --> 01:21:26,256
- Enjoy. - Enjoy.

1708
01:21:27,256 --> 01:21:29,625
- Isn't this our first meal? - Yes.

1709
01:21:29,626 --> 01:21:32,195
- It's our first meal together. - Everyone must be hungry.

1710
01:21:37,395 --> 01:21:38,536
Thank you.

1711
01:21:44,105 --> 01:21:45,506
The fishcakes are delicious.

1712
01:21:45,906 --> 01:21:47,506
The fishcakes are good.

1713
01:21:53,845 --> 01:21:55,616
- The perilla leaves are delicious. - They really are.

1714
01:22:00,485 --> 01:22:01,725
Everything here is delicious.

1715
01:22:02,326 --> 01:22:04,054
Is this a salad?

1716
01:22:04,055 --> 01:22:05,765
There's shrimp. What is this?

1717
01:22:06,525 --> 01:22:08,496
- Shrimp salad? - I think those are scallops.

1718
01:22:08,796 --> 01:22:10,336
Is this tofu?

1719
01:22:11,095 --> 01:22:12,265
I think it's tofu.

1720
01:22:12,866 --> 01:22:14,966
I ate a big one all by myself.

1721
01:22:16,605 --> 01:22:19,006
I think whoever wakes up and leaves early will have this salad.

1722
01:22:19,345 --> 01:22:21,376
It's insanely good.

1723
01:22:22,145 --> 01:22:23,746
Everything is so delicious.

1724
01:22:24,676 --> 01:22:28,085
I don't know how everything was so delicious.

1725
01:22:28,086 --> 01:22:31,655
It was especially nice since there was something I was used to.

1726
01:22:31,656 --> 01:22:33,685
The salad was really good too.

1727
01:22:33,956 --> 01:22:35,384
Everything was delicious.

1728
01:22:35,385 --> 01:22:37,595
They were so good that I kept exclaiming as I ate.

1729
01:22:37,796 --> 01:22:40,065
Those who have breakfast, what do you usually eat?

1730
01:22:40,525 --> 01:22:43,035
- I don't have breakfast. - At all?

1731
01:22:43,036 --> 01:22:44,435
I have French toast.

1732
01:22:44,695 --> 01:22:46,065
- You make them? - Gosh.

1733
01:22:46,765 --> 01:22:48,006
There's a toaster over there.

1734
01:22:49,406 --> 01:22:53,206
- That's not how I make it. - That's not the one he means.

1735
01:22:53,906 --> 01:22:56,116
You don't make French toast with a toaster.

1736
01:22:58,116 --> 01:22:59,684
- Was that a joke? - What?

1737
01:22:59,685 --> 01:23:01,046
Are they not the same thing?

1738
01:23:03,086 --> 01:23:05,586
You seem to like the jokes Yong Woo makes.

1739
01:23:05,985 --> 01:23:07,884
I saw a few earlier.

1740
01:23:07,885 --> 01:23:09,626
Are you saying...

1741
01:23:09,996 --> 01:23:11,395
- you like Yong Woo's jokes? - No.

1742
01:23:12,326 --> 01:23:14,425
- I'm sorry. - He likes...

1743
01:23:14,426 --> 01:23:15,564
You hurt my feelings.

1744
01:23:15,565 --> 01:23:17,734
How do I feel about Yong Woo's jokes?

1745
01:23:17,735 --> 01:23:19,234
- Yes. - They're funny.

1746
01:23:19,235 --> 01:23:21,265
- They're funny? Not bad? - Yes.

1747
01:23:24,836 --> 01:23:26,506
I hope a lot of you enjoy them.

1748
01:23:28,845 --> 01:23:30,176
The meat's gone cold already.

1749
01:23:30,515 --> 01:23:32,046
Meat is still delicious even if it's cold.

1750
01:23:32,885 --> 01:23:35,015
To be honest, since we didn't cook ourselves,

1751
01:23:35,485 --> 01:23:37,155
but rather we're eating what our parents made for us,

1752
01:23:37,156 --> 01:23:38,984
that's what's great about this.

1753
01:23:38,985 --> 01:23:40,025
- I'm reminded of them. - It's great.

1754
01:23:40,926 --> 01:23:42,184
- Do you often... - Yes.

1755
01:23:42,185 --> 01:23:44,655
share meals with other people like this?

1756
01:23:44,656 --> 01:23:48,394
Whether with your family or friends.

1757
01:23:48,395 --> 01:23:49,894
- Sometimes. - Do you do it often?

1758
01:23:49,895 --> 01:23:51,036
I eat with my family occasionally.

1759
01:23:52,765 --> 01:23:53,765
Do you usually eat alone?

1760
01:23:54,565 --> 01:23:57,805
Yes, I eat alone mostly.

1761
01:23:58,105 --> 01:23:59,746
So how do you feel about this?

1762
01:23:59,945 --> 01:24:01,274
- About eating like this here? - Yes.

1763
01:24:01,275 --> 01:24:03,274
- It's great. - It's great? It feels harmonious?

1764
01:24:03,275 --> 01:24:04,746
It feels harmonious.

1765
01:24:06,145 --> 01:24:08,184
These days, a lot of people eat alone.

1766
01:24:08,185 --> 01:24:10,286
Yes. That's right.

1767
01:24:10,685 --> 01:24:12,756
It's really not a common experience for me.

1768
01:24:13,626 --> 01:24:15,855
So as I was eating, I somehow...

1769
01:24:16,555 --> 01:24:20,796
kept thinking about my family.

1770
01:24:22,796 --> 01:24:25,036
I felt warm on the inside.

1771
01:24:25,906 --> 01:24:28,805
I was so nervous on the first day.

1772
01:24:29,735 --> 01:24:32,876
But having our parents' food there...

1773
01:24:33,445 --> 01:24:34,906
was really nice.

1774
01:24:36,145 --> 01:24:40,185
It was a precious dinner.

1775
01:24:41,416 --> 01:24:43,385
- Why don't we have a toast? - Sounds good.

1776
01:24:43,885 --> 01:24:46,724
- Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

1777
01:24:46,725 --> 01:24:48,425
- Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

1778
01:24:48,426 --> 01:24:49,595
- Cheers. - Cheers.

1779
01:24:51,656 --> 01:24:52,695
Are you not drinking?

1780
01:24:52,895 --> 01:24:54,826
No, I have a low alcohol tolerance.

1781
01:24:55,025 --> 01:24:56,336
- Are you done eating? - Yes.

1782
01:25:00,065 --> 01:25:01,406
- What? - What is that?

1783
01:25:02,105 --> 01:25:03,975
- They got a call. - They get calls?

1784
01:25:04,235 --> 01:25:05,305
I wonder what it is.

1785
01:25:07,105 --> 01:25:08,305
- What? - What is that?

1786
01:25:09,676 --> 01:25:10,876
- What? - What is that?

1787
01:25:11,216 --> 01:25:12,274
We even get calls?

1788
01:25:12,275 --> 01:25:13,314
(Somewhere, the telephone rings.)

1789
01:25:13,315 --> 01:25:14,385
Goodness.

1790
01:25:15,756 --> 01:25:16,984
- What is that? - Goodness.

1791
01:25:16,985 --> 01:25:18,854
(Someone is calling them.)

1792
01:25:18,855 --> 01:25:19,884
Goodness.

1793
01:25:19,885 --> 01:25:21,025
We even get calls?

1794
01:25:22,025 --> 01:25:23,055
I was so startled.

1795
01:25:23,256 --> 01:25:26,065
I didn't even notice the telephone.

1796
01:25:26,466 --> 01:25:29,595
The telephone rang so loudly.

1797
01:25:29,895 --> 01:25:32,804
So everyone was startled.

1798
01:25:32,805 --> 01:25:34,105
I didn't notice the telephone at all.

1799
01:25:34,536 --> 01:25:37,435
Many households don't even have telephones these days.

1800
01:25:37,536 --> 01:25:40,605
The telephone started ringing out of the blue, so I was startled.

1801
01:25:41,406 --> 01:25:42,546
We even get calls?

1802
01:25:45,116 --> 01:25:47,315
- Goodness. - We even get calls?

1803
01:25:49,116 --> 01:25:50,455
Right.

1804
01:25:50,456 --> 01:25:53,525
We heard something ring when we were eating.

1805
01:25:54,225 --> 01:25:56,125
"What? Where is it coming from?

1806
01:25:56,126 --> 01:25:57,394
Everyone was so startled...

1807
01:25:57,395 --> 01:26:00,126
because we don't usually have telephones in the house anymore.

1808
01:26:00,626 --> 01:26:02,064
We all use our cell phones.

1809
01:26:02,065 --> 01:26:05,295
My seat was the closest to where the ringing was coming from.

1810
01:26:05,296 --> 01:26:06,965
So I got up and looked,

1811
01:26:06,966 --> 01:26:09,336
and there really was a red telephone.

1812
01:26:10,305 --> 01:26:12,135
- Over there, on the wall. - On the wall.

1813
01:26:12,805 --> 01:26:15,576
Yes, hello?

1814
01:26:18,775 --> 01:26:21,014
Yes, hello? This is Se Seung's dad.

1815
01:26:21,015 --> 01:26:22,385
Is Se Seung there?

1816
01:26:24,515 --> 01:26:28,985
He says he's Se Seung's father.

1817
01:26:29,256 --> 01:26:30,656
I was so surprised.

1818
01:26:31,695 --> 01:26:33,264
I was really surprised.

1819
01:26:33,265 --> 01:26:37,036
The call came when I didn't even expect it.

1820
01:26:38,195 --> 01:26:39,966
Se Seung... Yes, she's here.

1821
01:26:40,305 --> 01:26:41,305
Hello.

1822
01:26:41,805 --> 01:26:43,376
Can you put Se Seung on the phone?

1823
01:26:45,876 --> 01:26:47,676
Yes, she's here.

1824
01:26:47,775 --> 01:26:49,345
Can you put Se Seung on the phone?

1825
01:26:50,145 --> 01:26:52,616
Yes. Okay. Se Seung, the phone.

1826
01:26:53,515 --> 01:26:54,546
What is this?

1827
01:26:58,315 --> 01:26:59,326
Hello?

1828
01:26:59,956 --> 01:27:01,256
- Se Seung. - Yes.

1829
01:27:01,855 --> 01:27:03,895
- Did you make it there safely? - Yes.

1830
01:27:05,765 --> 01:27:07,225
I am your dad.

1831
01:27:07,326 --> 01:27:09,966
- That's so random. - We know that, sir.

1832
01:27:11,496 --> 01:27:12,536
He's someone else's...

1833
01:27:12,635 --> 01:27:14,835
He's also the father of someone else at that table.

1834
01:27:14,836 --> 01:27:16,405
- Yes, that's right. - Of course.

1835
01:27:16,406 --> 01:27:18,375
We have to watch the male participants' faces too.

1836
01:27:18,376 --> 01:27:20,144
He's his son too.

1837
01:27:20,145 --> 01:27:21,645
- One of them must be flustered. - Right.

1838
01:27:22,775 --> 01:27:24,275
I am your dad.

1839
01:27:24,546 --> 01:27:27,246
Where are you?

1840
01:27:28,216 --> 01:27:29,515
Is he the owner of this house?

1841
01:27:32,116 --> 01:27:34,355
How is he related?

1842
01:27:35,355 --> 01:27:36,355
What's...

1843
01:27:39,296 --> 01:27:41,195
She went, "Dad?"

1844
01:27:42,225 --> 01:27:43,434
So we were like...

1845
01:27:43,435 --> 01:27:46,006
We were in the middle of eating when we started getting confused.

1846
01:27:46,105 --> 01:27:49,705
"So are we each talking to our parents?"

1847
01:27:49,706 --> 01:27:52,644
I did think that it would be possible...

1848
01:27:52,645 --> 01:27:54,604
for our parents...

1849
01:27:54,605 --> 01:27:57,514
to call, make a visit or send us supportive messages.

1850
01:27:57,515 --> 01:28:00,645
At first, we were all confused.

1851
01:28:00,885 --> 01:28:03,116
We were like, "Is her father coming here?"

1852
01:28:03,216 --> 01:28:04,685
"This is amazing."

1853
01:28:04,786 --> 01:28:08,326
"How should we treat the parents if they visit us?"

1854
01:28:08,956 --> 01:28:11,525
Where are you?

1855
01:28:12,025 --> 01:28:15,394
I'm home. Where else would I be?

1856
01:28:15,395 --> 01:28:17,395
I was worried about you, so I called.

1857
01:28:17,635 --> 01:28:19,635
I always call you.

1858
01:28:21,305 --> 01:28:22,305
What's going on?

1859
01:28:24,376 --> 01:28:25,975
- Se Seung. - This is amazing.

1860
01:28:26,945 --> 01:28:28,045
- Se Seung. - Yes.

1861
01:28:28,046 --> 01:28:32,176
It's going to be minus 3°C early tomorrow morning.

1862
01:28:33,015 --> 01:28:36,855
It's going to be cold, so dress warmly for bed.

1863
01:28:37,616 --> 01:28:39,385
Dad.

1864
01:28:39,586 --> 01:28:41,426
Where are you? Are you close by?

1865
01:28:41,786 --> 01:28:43,054
Yes, I'm close by.

1866
01:28:43,055 --> 01:28:44,555
- Really? - Turn around.

1867
01:28:47,265 --> 01:28:49,336
I'm always standing right behind you.

1868
01:28:54,006 --> 01:28:55,836
He always jokes that...

1869
01:28:56,735 --> 01:28:59,135
he'll be there if I turn around.

1870
01:28:59,576 --> 01:29:00,746
That he's right behind me.

1871
01:29:01,206 --> 01:29:05,216
But that especially touched my heart...

1872
01:29:05,775 --> 01:29:06,786
today.

1873
01:29:08,086 --> 01:29:09,885
- Is my son doing well? - Yes.

1874
01:29:10,256 --> 01:29:11,286
I see.

1875
01:29:13,656 --> 01:29:15,425
How is it? Are you having fun?

1876
01:29:15,426 --> 01:29:17,126
Yes, it's so fun.

1877
01:29:17,525 --> 01:29:18,926
- It's so fun? - Yes.

1878
01:29:19,025 --> 01:29:21,865
I guess you took the uhwang-cheongsimhwan I gave you.

1879
01:29:21,866 --> 01:29:23,495
You don't sound nervous at all.

1880
01:29:23,496 --> 01:29:25,796
Yes, I was fine when I got here. But you didn't give it to me.

1881
01:29:26,966 --> 01:29:28,604
I gave the uhwang-cheongsimhwan to your heart.

1882
01:29:28,605 --> 01:29:29,635
You gave it to my heart?

1883
01:29:35,506 --> 01:29:38,576
And do you feel like...

1884
01:29:38,975 --> 01:29:42,086
like any of them could be your boyfriend?

1885
01:29:43,015 --> 01:29:44,086
"Boyfriend."

1886
01:29:44,656 --> 01:29:45,955
He's so cute.

1887
01:29:45,956 --> 01:29:47,555
I think I hear her mother laughing in the background.

1888
01:29:47,626 --> 01:29:48,626
Right.

1889
01:29:48,786 --> 01:29:51,496
- Gosh, her family's so harmonious. - Right. It must be nice.

1890
01:29:52,095 --> 01:29:55,195
Like any of them could be your boyfriend?

1891
01:29:56,095 --> 01:29:57,095
Yes.

1892
01:29:57,366 --> 01:29:58,435
- Really? - Yes.

1893
01:30:00,036 --> 01:30:01,906
- I knew it. - Is Mom next to you?

1894
01:30:02,305 --> 01:30:04,134
Well, don't just go for looks.

1895
01:30:04,135 --> 01:30:07,145
Find someone who likes working out like me.

1896
01:30:07,246 --> 01:30:08,246
All right.

1897
01:30:09,105 --> 01:30:10,176
The doorbell's going to ring.

1898
01:30:11,076 --> 01:30:12,445
I feel like someone's going to be here.

1899
01:30:13,445 --> 01:30:14,746
I feel like they're going to visit all at once.

1900
01:30:14,985 --> 01:30:16,585
You don't think they'll be making...

1901
01:30:16,586 --> 01:30:18,015
- surprise visits, do you? - Gosh.

1902
01:30:19,286 --> 01:30:21,355
Okay. I'll put Mom on the phone.

1903
01:30:23,496 --> 01:30:24,895
- Hello? - Yes.

1904
01:30:25,256 --> 01:30:26,466
Surprise.

1905
01:30:27,095 --> 01:30:28,725
- My daughter. - Are you home?

1906
01:30:29,435 --> 01:30:30,635
Of course, I'm home.

1907
01:30:32,166 --> 01:30:35,406
So I hear there's someone who caught your eye.

1908
01:30:36,006 --> 01:30:37,506
I think so.

1909
01:30:38,006 --> 01:30:39,445
- Really? - Yes.

1910
01:30:40,006 --> 01:30:43,916
Then is this person who made a good first impression...

1911
01:30:44,845 --> 01:30:45,945
good-looking?

1912
01:30:50,256 --> 01:30:51,256
To me, he is.

1913
01:30:51,815 --> 01:30:53,955
- Is he? - Yes.

1914
01:30:53,956 --> 01:30:55,025
I see.

1915
01:30:56,095 --> 01:30:58,295
I can't really tell you out loud right now.

1916
01:30:58,296 --> 01:30:59,795
- You are? - We're all gathered together.

1917
01:30:59,796 --> 01:31:00,796
Yes.

1918
01:31:00,796 --> 01:31:01,796
- Se Seung. - Yes.

1919
01:31:02,426 --> 01:31:03,966
Is my son doing well?

1920
01:31:05,336 --> 01:31:07,406
- Yes. - I see.

1921
01:31:08,305 --> 01:31:09,935
What is he doing right now?

1922
01:31:15,975 --> 01:31:20,185
(Who is the mother's son?)

1923
01:31:22,116 --> 01:31:24,054
- He's on this side. - It's someone on this side.

1924
01:31:24,055 --> 01:31:25,355
Jae Hyung? It's Jae Hyung.

1925
01:31:25,855 --> 01:31:27,825
- No, it's Jung Sub. - No, it's Jung Sub.

1926
01:31:27,826 --> 01:31:29,286
It's Jung Sub.

1927
01:31:29,626 --> 01:31:31,495
He'e eating too.

1928
01:31:31,496 --> 01:31:33,525
- Is everyone eating together? - Yes.

1929
01:31:33,695 --> 01:31:37,564
(Who is the father's son?)

1930
01:31:37,565 --> 01:31:38,836
We're all eating together.

1931
01:31:48,145 --> 01:31:49,145
Yes.

1932
01:31:49,716 --> 01:31:52,716
(Who is Se Seung's sibling?)

1933
01:31:53,315 --> 01:31:54,315
Is he revealed right away?

1934
01:31:54,885 --> 01:31:56,384
- Is he revealed? - Really?

1935
01:31:56,385 --> 01:31:57,484
- Let's see. - Jung Sub.

1936
01:31:57,485 --> 01:31:59,014
I think it's Jung Sub. For real.

1937
01:31:59,015 --> 01:32:00,785
- It's not Jung Sub. - No, it's him.

1938
01:32:00,786 --> 01:32:02,796
- It's Jung Sub. - I think it's Jung Sub too.

1939
01:32:03,025 --> 01:32:05,155
I got a lot of hints through her dad.

1940
01:32:05,156 --> 01:32:06,826
Having a sense of humor...

1941
01:32:07,296 --> 01:32:09,734
is something you're born with.

1942
01:32:09,735 --> 01:32:11,665
Are you saying Jung Sub isn't humorous?

1943
01:32:11,666 --> 01:32:14,065
No, but Jung Sub and Jae Hyung have different kinds of humor.

1944
01:32:15,206 --> 01:32:17,774
With Jae Hyung, it's like, "I don't care if you laugh."

1945
01:32:17,775 --> 01:32:19,005
"I'm still going to keep going."

1946
01:32:19,006 --> 01:32:20,105
He kept telling jokes.

1947
01:32:20,206 --> 01:32:21,944
He's been telling jokes since the episode began.

1948
01:32:21,945 --> 01:32:24,045
I felt something similar with the father.

1949
01:32:24,046 --> 01:32:26,545
What if it really is Jae Hyung like Jonathan says?

1950
01:32:26,546 --> 01:32:29,854
- I still think it's Jung Sub. - Jonathan, you think it's...

1951
01:32:29,855 --> 01:32:32,086
- Jae Hyung. - Jae Hyung.

1952
01:32:32,456 --> 01:32:33,625
Hearing him out,

1953
01:32:33,626 --> 01:32:35,555
- I think he does have a point. - No, I still think it's Jung Sub.

1954
01:32:35,656 --> 01:32:37,456
- I think it's Jung Sub too. - I still think it's Jung Sub.

1955
01:32:37,555 --> 01:32:41,966
Just in case, I'm going to go with Cheol Hyeon.

1956
01:32:42,225 --> 01:32:43,765
- What? - What?

1957
01:32:43,866 --> 01:32:45,365
It's good to just take the extreme route.

1958
01:32:45,366 --> 01:32:47,405
- Really? - Just one.

1959
01:32:47,406 --> 01:32:48,705
- It's definitely Jung Sub. - It's definitely Jung Sub.

1960
01:32:48,706 --> 01:32:50,134
- For sure. - It's Jae Hyung.

1961
01:32:50,135 --> 01:32:51,804
Who do you think it is, Hye Jin?

1962
01:32:51,805 --> 01:32:53,974
I was leaning toward Jung Sub.

1963
01:32:53,975 --> 01:32:56,275
After listening to BamBam, I'm like "Is it Cheol Hyeon?"

1964
01:32:56,746 --> 01:32:57,844
I'm not sure at all.

1965
01:32:57,845 --> 01:32:59,246
Then Hye Jin, you should go with Yong Woo.

1966
01:33:00,845 --> 01:33:02,015
Just choose Yong Woo.

1967
01:33:02,716 --> 01:33:05,315
Yong Woo. I'll go with Yong Woo.

1968
01:33:05,855 --> 01:33:07,656
Okay. Show us who it is.

1969
01:33:07,956 --> 01:33:08,985
I can't wait any longer.

1970
01:33:09,426 --> 01:33:10,595
Gosh, who could it be?

1971
01:33:10,855 --> 01:33:13,195
- Who is Se Seung's sibling? - It's Jung Sub.

1972
01:33:13,395 --> 01:33:14,866
- Jung Sub, for sure. - Who is it?

1973
01:33:17,296 --> 01:33:18,835
Park Se Seung.

1974
01:33:18,836 --> 01:33:20,264
- Is my name. - Hello.

1975
01:33:20,265 --> 01:33:21,265
(Recital, December 17, 1999)

1976
01:33:21,266 --> 01:33:22,435
Se Seung, say "I'm pretty."

1977
01:33:24,105 --> 01:33:26,605
Her father has the same voice. It's Jae Hyung.

1978
01:33:26,706 --> 01:33:29,176
Mom, put this hair clip on my head.

1979
01:33:29,645 --> 01:33:32,015
If you put this here, you'll look pretty.

1980
01:33:35,086 --> 01:33:36,855
Mom, buy me snacks.

1981
01:33:38,716 --> 01:33:41,484
Are you going to do your best, like you do in front of me?

1982
01:33:41,485 --> 01:33:43,395
- Hey, take this instead. - Here.

1983
01:33:43,496 --> 01:33:45,524
Miss Park Se Seung.

1984
01:33:45,525 --> 01:33:46,695
So her sibling's older.

1985
01:33:47,796 --> 01:33:51,965
Hey, I'm good at finding spots with lots of snow.

1986
01:33:51,966 --> 01:33:54,735
I'm not going to have a snow fight with him.

1987
01:33:56,176 --> 01:33:58,005
- Her dialect is so cute. - Who is it?

1988
01:33:58,006 --> 01:34:03,145
(October 17, 2001)

1989
01:34:03,275 --> 01:34:05,415
- It's Jung Sub. - I told you.

1990
01:34:05,416 --> 01:34:07,245
- See, it's him. - It's Jung Sub.

1991
01:34:07,246 --> 01:34:09,315
- It's Jung Sub. - It's Jae Hyung.

1992
01:34:09,756 --> 01:34:11,416
Please, I want to hurry up and find out who it is.

1993
01:34:11,815 --> 01:34:12,985
My biological older brother?

1994
01:34:13,586 --> 01:34:14,586
My biological older brother is...

1995
01:34:14,956 --> 01:34:16,426
Don't we resemble each other a lot, though?

1996
01:34:17,426 --> 01:34:19,256
- We probably have the same nose. - You do have the same nose.

1997
01:34:19,796 --> 01:34:20,865
We have our mom's nose.

1998
01:34:20,866 --> 01:34:24,996
We'd be joking around with each other,

1999
01:34:25,095 --> 01:34:27,134
and then argue...

2000
01:34:27,135 --> 01:34:30,605
over the smallest things.

2001
01:34:31,076 --> 01:34:34,206
My older brother isn't that funny.

2002
01:34:37,515 --> 01:34:41,314
Compared to how my older brother is now,

2003
01:34:41,315 --> 01:34:43,086
I used to be more of an attention hog.

2004
01:34:44,185 --> 01:34:45,755
Are you saying your older brother is...

2005
01:34:45,756 --> 01:34:48,485
Right now, he's... Well, anyway.

2006
01:34:48,885 --> 01:34:50,895
I think we're very close.

2007
01:34:50,996 --> 01:34:53,496
I don't think we fight a lot since we've grown up.

2008
01:34:54,126 --> 01:34:56,336
I think we were close growing up...

2009
01:34:56,695 --> 01:34:57,695
when we were little.

2010
01:34:59,366 --> 01:35:00,706
We fought a lot when we were little.

2011
01:35:07,706 --> 01:35:12,445
(Se Seung's sibling will now be revealed.)

2012
01:35:14,116 --> 01:35:18,055
Put your hands up high

2013
01:35:18,786 --> 01:35:20,426
And stretch

2014
01:35:24,456 --> 01:35:26,594
I'm telling you, it's Jae Hyung.

2015
01:35:26,595 --> 01:35:28,094
- It's Jung Sub. - It's Jae Hyung.

2016
01:35:28,095 --> 01:35:29,694
I have a feeling it's Jae Hyung. It can't be.

2017
01:35:29,695 --> 01:35:30,995
- He has big eyes. - It's Jae Hyung.

2018
01:35:30,996 --> 01:35:31,996
I swear...

2019
01:35:31,997 --> 01:35:34,005
- I think it's Jae Hyung. - Was he revealed?

2020
01:35:34,006 --> 01:35:35,006
Show us.

2021
01:35:35,007 --> 01:35:36,234
He has Jae Hyung's eyes.

2022
01:35:36,235 --> 01:35:37,235
I think it's Jae Hyung.

2023
01:35:37,775 --> 01:35:39,434
- I think it's Jae Hyung. - It's Jae Hyung.

2024
01:35:39,435 --> 01:35:41,844
We're not trying to reunite lost families.

2025
01:35:41,845 --> 01:35:44,046
Guys, why are you doing this to us?

2026
01:35:44,275 --> 01:35:45,375
Show us who it is.

2027
01:35:45,376 --> 01:35:46,415
- What if it's really Cheol Hyeon? - Show us.

2028
01:35:46,416 --> 01:35:47,485
Don't mess around with the baby.

2029
01:35:47,985 --> 01:35:49,716
Run

2030
01:35:50,216 --> 01:35:52,715
Run around

2031
01:35:52,716 --> 01:35:55,885
You're doing so well, Jae Hyung.

2032
01:35:55,985 --> 01:35:57,724
Jae Hyung. She said "Jae Hyung."

2033
01:35:57,725 --> 01:35:59,024
- It's Jae Hyung. - It's Jae Hyung?

2034
01:35:59,025 --> 01:36:00,025
- She said Jae Hyung? - I told you, it's Jae Hyung!

2035
01:36:00,026 --> 01:36:01,694
What did I tell you? It's Jae Hyung.

2036
01:36:01,695 --> 01:36:04,465
- They have the same nose. - What's going on?

2037
01:36:04,466 --> 01:36:06,934
- Gosh. It's Jae Hyung? - From the moment he walked in,

2038
01:36:06,935 --> 01:36:08,234
- I knew he was Se Seung's sibling. - Goodness.

2039
01:36:08,235 --> 01:36:09,634
Jonathan, you have a keen eye.

2040
01:36:09,635 --> 01:36:12,134
- Gosh. - So then, in the beginning,

2041
01:36:12,135 --> 01:36:13,304
they were just that good at acting?

2042
01:36:13,305 --> 01:36:14,344
I told you.

2043
01:36:14,345 --> 01:36:15,975
Wait, I have to think about it from the beginning.

2044
01:36:16,376 --> 01:36:17,875
- That's crazy, Jonathan. - So I saw that...

2045
01:36:17,876 --> 01:36:20,585
and went, "If something was on the line, I could act like that..."

2046
01:36:20,586 --> 01:36:22,014
- "with Patricia too." - Look, I said in the beginning...

2047
01:36:22,015 --> 01:36:24,684
that the crew would start off with actual siblings.

2048
01:36:24,685 --> 01:36:26,484
That's why I went, "There's no way they're siblings."

2049
01:36:26,485 --> 01:36:27,786
There really was a way.

2050
01:36:28,485 --> 01:36:30,996
So those two really acted that well in the beginning?

2051
01:36:31,426 --> 01:36:33,224
That's insane. Their acting was insane.

2052
01:36:33,225 --> 01:36:35,495
Gosh, so it really is Jae Hyung?

2053
01:36:35,496 --> 01:36:37,965
- It was only those two for me. - Gosh, but their acting...

2054
01:36:37,966 --> 01:36:39,595
- was really good. - From the beginning, it was them.

2055
01:36:39,706 --> 01:36:42,006
I saw their noses and knew they were siblings.

2056
01:36:42,735 --> 01:36:46,076
You're doing so well, Jae Hyung.

2057
01:36:48,046 --> 01:36:50,875
What is that? It's Daddy. Say "Daddy."

2058
01:36:50,876 --> 01:36:54,786
To be honest, I had a hard time giving birth to Jae Hyung.

2059
01:36:55,416 --> 01:36:58,256
I had two miscarriages before having Jae Hyung.

2060
01:36:58,685 --> 01:37:00,625
And when I was a week pregnant with Jae Hyung,

2061
01:37:00,626 --> 01:37:02,355
I experienced irregular bleeding.

2062
01:37:02,685 --> 01:37:05,456
The OB-GYN told me I would have another miscarriage.

2063
01:37:06,866 --> 01:37:09,595
Another week later, I had an ultrasound,

2064
01:37:09,695 --> 01:37:13,135
and saw that the gestational sac had formed.

2065
01:37:16,735 --> 01:37:17,735
Say, "Daddy."

2066
01:37:18,676 --> 01:37:19,676
Say, "Daddy."

2067
01:37:20,046 --> 01:37:23,144
They said, "It looks like this is going to be your baby, Ms. Jeon."

2068
01:37:23,145 --> 01:37:25,314
"He's growing in there."

2069
01:37:25,315 --> 01:37:26,716
I'm Superman.

2070
01:37:27,616 --> 01:37:29,715
I don't think I've ever been...

2071
01:37:29,716 --> 01:37:31,615
more grateful in my life.

2072
01:37:31,616 --> 01:37:33,126
We were so thankful and grateful.

2073
01:37:33,225 --> 01:37:35,926
She'd had such a hard time.

2074
01:37:37,095 --> 01:37:40,265
Jae Hyung was such a handsome baby.

2075
01:37:40,366 --> 01:37:41,894
Wherever we went, adults would say,

2076
01:37:41,895 --> 01:37:43,866
"Gosh, he's so handsome."

2077
01:37:44,866 --> 01:37:47,105
He would smile with his eyes like this,

2078
01:37:47,466 --> 01:37:50,375
and women passing by on the street...

2079
01:37:50,376 --> 01:37:52,735
would give him things like balloons.

2080
01:37:53,906 --> 01:37:57,274
All right. Mr. Park Jae Hyung, it snowed today.

2081
01:37:57,275 --> 01:37:58,376
How do you feel?

2082
01:37:58,845 --> 01:38:01,216
Yes, it snowed a lot.

2083
01:38:01,315 --> 01:38:03,156
Yes, please lead the way.

2084
01:38:03,286 --> 01:38:06,755
(April 5, 2001)

2085
01:38:06,756 --> 01:38:08,555
You're getting dust all over the gimbap.

2086
01:38:11,355 --> 01:38:12,756
He was adorable.

2087
01:38:13,025 --> 01:38:15,465
He danced in front of people.

2088
01:38:15,466 --> 01:38:16,536
He is shaking his hips.

2089
01:38:18,065 --> 01:38:19,734
Jae Hyung liked to sing,

2090
01:38:19,735 --> 01:38:22,505
so he sang loudly.

2091
01:38:22,506 --> 01:38:24,505
Jae Hyung's voice was so loud.

2092
01:38:24,506 --> 01:38:25,535
(July 5, 2002)

2093
01:38:25,536 --> 01:38:27,706
Sometimes, we got a headache.

2094
01:38:28,475 --> 01:38:30,115
When I told him to stop,

2095
01:38:30,116 --> 01:38:31,844
he sang more loudly in order to torment us.

2096
01:38:31,845 --> 01:38:35,115
We are going right now.

2097
01:38:35,116 --> 01:38:36,416
Hello.

2098
01:38:40,055 --> 01:38:42,185
He was so mischievous.

2099
01:38:42,355 --> 01:38:43,895
He was so cute. My goodness.

2100
01:38:44,225 --> 01:38:46,025
He was funny in childhood.

2101
01:38:48,195 --> 01:38:49,525
He is funny now, but still.

2102
01:38:51,065 --> 01:38:52,296
He is funny now, but still.

2103
01:38:53,605 --> 01:38:56,935
My husband eagerly waited for a daughter.

2104
01:38:57,376 --> 01:39:00,444
And Jae Hyung... They say children can sense it.

2105
01:39:00,445 --> 01:39:03,715
He always asked me to put...

2106
01:39:03,716 --> 01:39:05,546
a hairpin in his hair.

2107
01:39:05,746 --> 01:39:08,246
There was a bit of jealousy,

2108
01:39:08,685 --> 01:39:10,655
but Jae Hyung cherished his sister.

2109
01:39:10,656 --> 01:39:12,685
(October 17, 2001)

2110
01:39:31,635 --> 01:39:33,775
They were very close in childhood.

2111
01:39:34,246 --> 01:39:35,805
They got along very well.

2112
01:39:36,105 --> 01:39:38,745
I sent them to the same kindergarten.

2113
01:39:38,746 --> 01:39:41,184
Since they were always together,

2114
01:39:41,185 --> 01:39:42,845
they resembled each other a lot.

2115
01:39:43,885 --> 01:39:45,514
Park Se Seung is sleeping.

2116
01:39:45,515 --> 01:39:48,656
Park Jae Hyung, how does it feel to look outside the window?

2117
01:39:49,326 --> 01:39:51,496
It's pretty.

2118
01:39:52,595 --> 01:39:53,866
It's pretty.

2119
01:39:55,065 --> 01:39:56,735
He looks like a child who doesn't listen to anyone.

2120
01:39:58,135 --> 01:40:01,506
As for Se Seung... My son was cute and all,

2121
01:40:02,065 --> 01:40:04,635
but I wanted to have a daughter.

2122
01:40:04,775 --> 01:40:07,706
So personally speaking, she is more dear to me than my son.

2123
01:40:08,006 --> 01:40:09,775
In childhood, she once had...

2124
01:40:10,315 --> 01:40:14,286
the hairstyle with an intense perm called the Bomb Hair.

2125
01:40:14,645 --> 01:40:16,345
I almost went crazy then.

2126
01:40:18,256 --> 01:40:19,616
She was so cute that I almost went crazy then.

2127
01:40:20,385 --> 01:40:22,125
I am the cute type.

2128
01:40:22,126 --> 01:40:23,495
I am someone who acts cute a lot.

2129
01:40:23,496 --> 01:40:27,025
She copied me in that regard.

2130
01:40:28,565 --> 01:40:29,725
We were very similar.

2131
01:40:30,496 --> 01:40:32,234
- Look at Dad. - Look at Dad.

2132
01:40:32,235 --> 01:40:35,166
(Talent show)

2133
01:40:39,406 --> 01:40:40,605
Look at her mouth.

2134
01:40:40,775 --> 01:40:43,445
That's the face you make when you apply mascara.

2135
01:40:46,716 --> 01:40:49,715
When they were young, our roles as parents were important.

2136
01:40:49,716 --> 01:40:50,984
But now, they are adults.

2137
01:40:50,985 --> 01:40:53,685
Now, it's a person to a person.

2138
01:40:53,926 --> 01:40:57,126
I want them to look at me and think, "Things don't go badly..."

2139
01:40:57,395 --> 01:40:59,724
"when I copy him."

2140
01:40:59,725 --> 01:41:02,326
I want to be remembered as a man.

2141
01:41:08,435 --> 01:41:10,676
- I look the youngest. - It's a video.

2142
01:41:11,105 --> 01:41:12,576
I look like a single man.

2143
01:41:15,176 --> 01:41:17,045
- I think it will be fun. - You think it will be fun.

2144
01:41:17,046 --> 01:41:18,376
Look at Kyung Tae's face.

2145
01:41:19,515 --> 01:41:21,344
- Come on. - He has the biggest face.

2146
01:41:21,345 --> 01:41:22,645
You take the camera, Jae Hyung.

2147
01:41:23,385 --> 01:41:25,116
He has the biggest face.

2148
01:41:26,116 --> 01:41:27,326
Come on.

2149
01:41:27,485 --> 01:41:28,956
The family composition is so good.

2150
01:41:29,555 --> 01:41:32,996
- They have a fun life. - All of them are very cheerful.

2151
01:41:33,025 --> 01:41:35,265
- Yes, they are. - It's a very cheerful family.

2152
01:41:35,626 --> 01:41:37,935
Watching the video made me want to get married.

2153
01:41:38,935 --> 01:41:40,765
- It made me want to get married. - Really?

2154
01:41:41,036 --> 01:41:43,835
This is a show that promotes marriage.

2155
01:41:43,836 --> 01:41:45,635
It will tackle the serious matter of low birthrate.

2156
01:41:46,406 --> 01:41:48,774
Didn't you fight often?

2157
01:41:48,775 --> 01:41:50,345
- In childhood, we fought a lot. - We fought so much.

2158
01:41:50,775 --> 01:41:52,445
I started it most of the time.

2159
01:41:55,445 --> 01:41:58,485
(Se Seung's birthday)

2160
01:41:59,416 --> 01:42:02,325
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

2161
01:42:02,326 --> 01:42:03,326
Make a wish.

2162
01:42:04,195 --> 01:42:05,456
I will do it with you.

2163
01:42:09,225 --> 01:42:11,496
Do you want to do it again?

2164
01:42:11,996 --> 01:42:13,605
Shall I light up the candles again?

2165
01:42:13,765 --> 01:42:15,206
Okay. I will light up the candles again.

2166
01:42:17,376 --> 01:42:20,275
- You will look ugly if you cry. - Don't cry on your birthday.

2167
01:42:20,376 --> 01:42:22,376
(July 5, 2002)

2168
01:42:26,645 --> 01:42:27,645
I hit her.

2169
01:42:27,646 --> 01:42:30,685
- Don't actually hit her. - I am sorry.

2170
01:42:44,996 --> 01:42:46,395
So annoying.

2171
01:42:47,235 --> 01:42:50,305
Why do I get picked on the same way even after a decade?

2172
01:42:50,676 --> 01:42:51,906
Some things don't change.

2173
01:42:56,376 --> 01:42:58,576
We became more mature.

2174
01:42:58,916 --> 01:43:00,716
We became more adults.

2175
01:43:01,015 --> 01:43:03,315
But we lost so many things along the way.

2176
01:43:03,485 --> 01:43:05,054
I think I am here to find those things.

2177
01:43:05,055 --> 01:43:07,586
Looking at you makes me feel more clearly.

2178
01:43:10,725 --> 01:43:14,926
(Park Jae Hyung)

2179
01:43:15,126 --> 01:43:18,235
(Park Se Seung)

2180
01:43:26,475 --> 01:43:27,675
We got a message.

2181
01:43:27,676 --> 01:43:28,745
- Really? - Really?

2182
01:43:28,746 --> 01:43:31,715
(Send the name of the person your sibling will be drawn to.)

2183
01:43:31,716 --> 01:43:33,945
I chose Jung Sub.

2184
01:43:34,286 --> 01:43:36,286
I think Jung Sub is the closest to her ideal type.

2185
01:43:39,286 --> 01:43:42,525
(To whom did you write the Cupid Message?)

2186
01:43:43,055 --> 01:43:44,496
Jung Sub.

2187
01:43:47,265 --> 01:43:49,724
(The person Se Seung was drawn to at first sight)

2188
01:43:49,725 --> 01:43:50,895
- Hello. - Hello.

2189
01:44:04,015 --> 01:44:06,474
I thought he was very quiet.

2190
01:44:06,475 --> 01:44:10,515
But he said funny things from time to time.

2191
01:44:10,916 --> 01:44:12,116
You are a robot.

2192
01:44:15,355 --> 01:44:16,456
It was fun.

2193
01:44:16,555 --> 01:44:19,025
I think we will be compatible personality-wise.

2194
01:44:19,426 --> 01:44:23,224
Jung Sub and Ju Yeon seemed like siblings,

2195
01:44:23,225 --> 01:44:24,496
so I sent it to Ju Yeon.

2196
01:44:24,595 --> 01:44:27,706
They had similar images. Both of them were cute.

2197
01:44:27,866 --> 01:44:29,564
They looked comfortable...

2198
01:44:29,565 --> 01:44:31,775
around each other.

2199
01:44:34,475 --> 01:44:38,315
(Se Seung to Jung Sub)

2200
01:44:38,845 --> 01:44:42,285
Relax and enjoy yourself.

2201
01:44:42,286 --> 01:44:44,455
I hope you will find a man like me.

2202
01:44:44,456 --> 01:44:46,015
I will give it some thought.

2203
01:44:46,156 --> 01:44:50,495
In any case, stay healthy and enjoy yourself.

2204
01:44:50,496 --> 01:44:51,594
- Okay. - Bye, my daughter.

2205
01:44:51,595 --> 01:44:53,295
- Don't catch a cold. - I love you, my daughter.

2206
01:44:53,296 --> 01:44:54,525
I love you too.

2207
01:44:56,695 --> 01:44:57,965
Bye. Good night.

2208
01:44:57,966 --> 01:44:59,866
- Okay. I love you. - Okay.

2209
01:45:02,735 --> 01:45:05,075
- How sweet. - That's so sweet.

2210
01:45:05,076 --> 01:45:06,176
I know.

2211
01:45:14,786 --> 01:45:16,385
I can't believe it.

2212
01:45:16,485 --> 01:45:17,685
What happened?

2213
01:45:18,256 --> 01:45:21,155
She made kissing sounds to her dad.

2214
01:45:21,156 --> 01:45:23,826
She went, "I love you too," and made kissing sounds.

2215
01:45:24,656 --> 01:45:27,195
It was so shocking to me.

2216
01:45:28,025 --> 01:45:30,025
I couldn't believe that such a family existed.

2217
01:45:30,735 --> 01:45:32,366
I was jealous.

2218
01:45:33,366 --> 01:45:35,565
It was so lovely.

2219
01:45:35,866 --> 01:45:37,134
It was heartwarming...

2220
01:45:37,135 --> 01:45:39,935
to see Se Seung get a call from her parents.

2221
01:45:40,345 --> 01:45:44,116
I thought that her sibling might be disappointed.

2222
01:45:44,716 --> 01:45:47,245
I wasn't disappointed. I am not young anymore.

2223
01:45:47,246 --> 01:45:50,415
"Aren't you cold? Did you have a meal?"

2224
01:45:50,416 --> 01:45:54,355
"Are you feeling okay?" I bet they asked her these things.

2225
01:45:55,685 --> 01:45:57,656
- That was so sweet. - I can't believe it.

2226
01:45:58,095 --> 01:45:59,156
What happened?

2227
01:45:59,355 --> 01:46:01,095
They just called to check up on me.

2228
01:46:02,025 --> 01:46:03,734
- To check up on you? - Yes.

2229
01:46:03,735 --> 01:46:05,564
- They aren't here. - No.

2230
01:46:05,565 --> 01:46:07,735
- Was it just a call? - Yes.

2231
01:46:08,065 --> 01:46:09,406
I think they are home.

2232
01:46:10,305 --> 01:46:11,535
Both Mom and Dad.

2233
01:46:11,536 --> 01:46:12,536
Home.

2234
01:46:13,605 --> 01:46:14,605
Are they worried?

2235
01:46:14,606 --> 01:46:16,104
Well, they worried that it might be cold here.

2236
01:46:16,105 --> 01:46:17,445
- They thought it might be cold. - They worried about that.

2237
01:46:18,475 --> 01:46:20,315
They asked me if I liked anyone.

2238
01:46:21,485 --> 01:46:23,344
- It was nice to see. - I bet it made you feel good.

2239
01:46:23,345 --> 01:46:25,416
Yes. It surprised me.

2240
01:46:27,086 --> 01:46:28,156
I had a good meal.

2241
01:46:30,756 --> 01:46:33,354
Does everyone have an English name? Can we talk about this?

2242
01:46:33,355 --> 01:46:34,525
I think we can share our English names.

2243
01:46:34,866 --> 01:46:36,895
- I don't have an English name. - Me neither.

2244
01:46:37,935 --> 01:46:39,134
Do you have an English name?

2245
01:46:39,135 --> 01:46:40,194
I don't use it.

2246
01:46:40,195 --> 01:46:41,634
You can probably use your own name.

2247
01:46:41,635 --> 01:46:42,635
- That's right. - It's easy to pronounce.

2248
01:46:42,666 --> 01:46:44,505
- Cho A. - Cho A. That's right.

2249
01:46:44,506 --> 01:46:46,006
- Cho A is really... - Cho A.

2250
01:46:46,676 --> 01:46:48,406
He stopped himself from saying something.

2251
01:46:48,845 --> 01:46:51,274
- Why don't you let it out? - That's right.

2252
01:46:51,275 --> 01:46:52,315
Why don't you let it out?

2253
01:46:52,416 --> 01:46:53,545
- Shall I do that? - Yes.

2254
01:46:53,546 --> 01:46:55,246
I thought about saying, "Cho A is nice."

2255
01:46:56,315 --> 01:46:58,184
I can pronounce "Nice" like "Zoa."

2256
01:46:58,185 --> 01:46:59,785
Z, O, A. Zoa.

2257
01:46:59,786 --> 01:47:00,985
It's really nice.

2258
01:47:01,256 --> 01:47:03,225
- Cho A is Zoa. - Zoa.

2259
01:47:03,485 --> 01:47:05,326
It's so fitting.

2260
01:47:06,225 --> 01:47:07,365
It's so nice.

2261
01:47:07,366 --> 01:47:08,394
(Startled)

2262
01:47:08,395 --> 01:47:09,496
That's so funny.

2263
01:47:09,826 --> 01:47:11,296
Who wants to go outside?

2264
01:47:18,336 --> 01:47:19,705
- Is something at the door? - I think so.

2265
01:47:19,706 --> 01:47:21,746
- Something is at the door. - We were busy laughing.

2266
01:47:21,845 --> 01:47:22,905
Seriously.

2267
01:47:22,906 --> 01:47:24,015
- We got something. - He is the busiest.

2268
01:47:24,216 --> 01:47:26,216
- Please read it. - He is so dependable.

2269
01:47:27,116 --> 01:47:28,985
"The Siblings' Room has opened."

2270
01:47:29,815 --> 01:47:33,086
"Enter in an order and deliver the Cupid Message."

2271
01:47:34,885 --> 01:47:36,354
"Wait for further instructions..."

2272
01:47:36,355 --> 01:47:37,695
"to move outside the house."

2273
01:47:38,395 --> 01:47:39,595
This is incredible. This is so much fun.

2274
01:47:40,496 --> 01:47:42,426
"The Siblings' Room has opened."

2275
01:47:42,765 --> 01:47:43,996
The Siblings' Room.

2276
01:47:44,336 --> 01:47:45,536
It's so much fun.

2277
01:47:45,866 --> 01:47:49,065
Hearing about the Siblings' Room gave me goosebumps.

2278
01:47:49,605 --> 01:47:51,975
The Siblings' Room was something...

2279
01:47:52,206 --> 01:47:54,275
I eagerly waited for.

2280
01:47:54,445 --> 01:47:57,116
I felt like I could finally breathe.

2281
01:47:57,515 --> 01:48:00,515
I felt a variety of emotions.

2282
01:48:00,786 --> 01:48:03,815
He seemed dearer and more precious to me.

2283
01:48:04,315 --> 01:48:06,315
I couldn't wait to go and talk to him.

2284
01:48:08,656 --> 01:48:10,695
(They come out of the house one at a time.)

2285
01:48:11,355 --> 01:48:12,394
(To prevent deductions,)

2286
01:48:12,395 --> 01:48:13,695
(the participants moved at different times.)

2287
01:48:14,326 --> 01:48:16,666
(They are headed...)

2288
01:48:17,135 --> 01:48:19,536
(to the Siblings' Room.)

2289
01:48:24,176 --> 01:48:26,836
(The room is full of childhood memories.)

2290
01:48:28,006 --> 01:48:30,006
The Siblings' Room. It sounds strange.

2291
01:48:30,105 --> 01:48:31,745
I know. They are going to go, "Whom do you like?"

2292
01:48:31,746 --> 01:48:32,875
I know.

2293
01:48:32,876 --> 01:48:34,344
- They could help each other. - "What do you think?"

2294
01:48:34,345 --> 01:48:35,916
- "Who caught your eyes?" - "What do you think of so-and-so?"

2295
01:48:36,116 --> 01:48:37,515
That room isn't for fighting, is it?

2296
01:48:37,756 --> 01:48:40,925
I would want to go inside that room.

2297
01:48:40,926 --> 01:48:42,524
- I would want to talk. - Really?

2298
01:48:42,525 --> 01:48:44,495
It would be fun.

2299
01:48:44,496 --> 01:48:46,355
- You would talk candidly. - That's right.

2300
01:48:51,466 --> 01:48:54,135
I thought of the Chamber of Secrets in "Harry Potter."

2301
01:48:54,265 --> 01:48:55,735
I like "Harry Potter."

2302
01:49:05,975 --> 01:49:07,586
I thought it would be fun.

2303
01:49:07,685 --> 01:49:09,616
I wanted to play around with my sister.

2304
01:49:10,756 --> 01:49:11,855
Are you doing okay?

2305
01:49:12,015 --> 01:49:14,555
Yes. I am having a lot of fun.

2306
01:49:14,656 --> 01:49:16,455
It feels a bit strange, right?

2307
01:49:16,456 --> 01:49:18,055
What do you think it's like for me?

2308
01:49:18,195 --> 01:49:19,326
You are being overly cheerful, right?

2309
01:49:19,496 --> 01:49:21,194
Overly cheerful?

2310
01:49:21,195 --> 01:49:22,595
That's what I think.

2311
01:49:22,826 --> 01:49:26,094
(It's a place for the siblings.)

2312
01:49:26,095 --> 01:49:27,435
No one will know...

2313
01:49:27,466 --> 01:49:28,835
- Why? - that we're siblings.

2314
01:49:28,836 --> 01:49:30,475
I thought it was pretty obvious.

2315
01:49:33,576 --> 01:49:36,406
(Ju Yeon leaves the house.)

2316
01:49:37,815 --> 01:49:38,945
I am happy to see him.

2317
01:49:39,116 --> 01:49:40,685
There are many things I want to ask...

2318
01:49:41,086 --> 01:49:43,116
and many things I want to tell him.

2319
01:49:49,086 --> 01:49:50,755
- You are right. - See?

2320
01:49:50,756 --> 01:49:51,825
She is happy to see him.

2321
01:49:51,826 --> 01:49:54,064
There are many things I want to tell him.

2322
01:49:54,065 --> 01:49:55,764
"Everyone picked you."

2323
01:49:55,765 --> 01:49:57,595
- "Why are you popular?" - That's right.

2324
01:49:58,695 --> 01:49:59,695
Is it Yong Woo?

2325
01:50:01,006 --> 01:50:03,605
(Yo)

2326
01:50:08,376 --> 01:50:11,015
How are things?

2327
01:50:12,616 --> 01:50:14,086
I missed you.

2328
01:50:16,645 --> 01:50:20,525
(Who is Ju Yeon's sibling?)

2329
01:50:20,956 --> 01:50:23,184
- It's Yong Woo. - It's so easy.

2330
01:50:23,185 --> 01:50:24,194
I guess they will tell us now.

2331
01:50:24,195 --> 01:50:26,854
- Will it be revealed? - Yong Woo. It has to be Yong Woo.

2332
01:50:26,855 --> 01:50:28,564
- We can't be wrong. - If it isn't Yong Woo,

2333
01:50:28,565 --> 01:50:31,194
- I will be so surprised. - Let's ask Jonathan...

2334
01:50:31,195 --> 01:50:32,435
- one last time. - Yes.

2335
01:50:32,536 --> 01:50:34,006
- Right. - The divine Jonathan,

2336
01:50:34,305 --> 01:50:35,505
is it Yong Woo?

2337
01:50:35,506 --> 01:50:36,835
It's Yong Woo.

2338
01:50:36,836 --> 01:50:38,234
It's Yong Woo.

2339
01:50:38,235 --> 01:50:39,876
- Yong Woo. - It's Yong Woo.

2340
01:50:40,206 --> 01:50:41,344
We have the same opinion.

2341
01:50:41,345 --> 01:50:42,575
- Ju Yeon's sibling. - We agree that it's Yong Woo.

2342
01:50:42,576 --> 01:50:44,515
- If it isn't him... - Ju Yeon and Yong Woo.

2343
01:50:45,546 --> 01:50:47,076
We can't get this wrong too.

2344
01:50:50,216 --> 01:50:52,616
January 24, 2003.

2345
01:50:52,756 --> 01:50:57,555
The family came to a nearby movie theater.

2346
01:50:58,355 --> 01:51:00,594
I will close up...

2347
01:51:00,595 --> 01:51:02,996
on the handsome Lee Yong Woo.

2348
01:51:04,895 --> 01:51:06,866
- We got it right. It was easy. - We got it right.

2349
01:51:07,065 --> 01:51:08,265
He looked the same.

2350
01:51:09,935 --> 01:51:12,135
- He was handsome since childhood. - I know.

2351
01:51:14,006 --> 01:51:15,105
Smile in a cool way.

2352
01:51:16,006 --> 01:51:18,716
Smile in a cool way. Don't show a smirk.

2353
01:51:22,015 --> 01:51:23,645
My first child, Yong Woo,

2354
01:51:24,685 --> 01:51:26,116
was big ever since he was born.

2355
01:51:26,286 --> 01:51:29,286
Newborns wear a baby gown...

2356
01:51:29,385 --> 01:51:32,156
that's long enough to cover the feet.

2357
01:51:32,525 --> 01:51:34,126
But his feet stuck out.

2358
01:51:36,565 --> 01:51:40,496
Other people raised their children like princes and princesses,

2359
01:51:40,765 --> 01:51:43,235
but I couldn't look after them much since I was busy with work.

2360
01:51:44,676 --> 01:51:45,705
Come on.

2361
01:51:45,706 --> 01:51:47,135
He is very mischievous.

2362
01:51:47,906 --> 01:51:49,445
He likes sports a lot.

2363
01:51:49,906 --> 01:51:51,246
He likes his friends.

2364
01:51:51,916 --> 01:51:53,075
Although he was mischievous,

2365
01:51:53,076 --> 01:51:57,286
I often saw him read books when he came home.

2366
01:51:57,855 --> 01:52:01,786
It put a working mom's mind at ease.

2367
01:52:02,786 --> 01:52:04,326
"He is growing up well."

2368
01:52:09,126 --> 01:52:10,795
(Do you remember the day your sibling was born?)

2369
01:52:10,796 --> 01:52:12,496
I still remember it clearly.

2370
01:52:13,095 --> 01:52:14,305
I was ten years old.

2371
01:52:15,235 --> 01:52:16,305
Suddenly,

2372
01:52:17,036 --> 01:52:20,134
a call about the baby being born made everyone excited.

2373
01:52:20,135 --> 01:52:22,445
They showed me the baby.

2374
01:52:23,145 --> 01:52:25,145
As if they were showing me a fish they just caught,

2375
01:52:26,046 --> 01:52:27,546
they showed me the baby. I remember that.

2376
01:52:29,945 --> 01:52:30,984
They are ten years apart.

2377
01:52:30,985 --> 01:52:32,385
Are they ten years apart?

2378
01:52:32,786 --> 01:52:34,985
- Seriously. - He must have doted on her.

2379
01:52:35,456 --> 01:52:37,894
(When Yong Woo was ten years old,)

2380
01:52:37,895 --> 01:52:40,055
(Ju Yeon was born.)

2381
01:52:40,296 --> 01:52:41,825
I couldn't look after her much.

2382
01:52:41,826 --> 01:52:45,695
At home, her older brother looked after her the most.

2383
01:52:46,695 --> 01:52:47,905
He kept his eyes on his sister...

2384
01:52:47,906 --> 01:52:50,264
and played with her for an hour or two.

2385
01:52:50,265 --> 01:52:51,775
He also changed her diapers.

2386
01:52:52,105 --> 01:52:54,676
He was very good at preparing baby formula.

2387
01:52:55,305 --> 01:52:56,676
He did it better than me.

2388
01:53:06,055 --> 01:53:09,786
Any young boy would have gotten repulsed...

2389
01:53:09,926 --> 01:53:12,854
by a newborn's poop on the cloth diapers.

2390
01:53:12,855 --> 01:53:14,826
But Yong Woo wasn't like that.

2391
01:53:14,966 --> 01:53:17,194
He watched me change her diaper and said,

2392
01:53:17,195 --> 01:53:20,235
"Mom, I will do it." Then he changed her diaper.

2393
01:53:20,735 --> 01:53:22,935
I held her in my arms and gave her a bath.

2394
01:53:23,406 --> 01:53:24,706
I supported her head like this.

2395
01:53:25,135 --> 01:53:26,506
Taking care of Ju Yeon...

2396
01:53:27,076 --> 01:53:31,046
didn't feel like homework.

2397
01:53:31,315 --> 01:53:32,475
It was my life...

2398
01:53:33,376 --> 01:53:34,416
and my responsibility.

2399
01:53:35,246 --> 01:53:36,815
I found the joy of childcare.

2400
01:53:38,216 --> 01:53:43,456
(Ju Yeon was a precious part of Yong Woo's life.)

2401
01:53:44,256 --> 01:53:46,595
He is such a nice older brother.

2402
01:53:46,855 --> 01:53:48,295
It would suffice to say...

2403
01:53:48,296 --> 01:53:49,625
- that he raised her. - He raised her.

2404
01:53:49,626 --> 01:53:51,264
He can say, "I raised you."

2405
01:53:51,265 --> 01:53:52,435
It's so heartwarming.

2406
01:53:52,836 --> 01:53:54,906
Ju Yeon was so cute.

2407
01:54:00,435 --> 01:54:02,974
I don't think I look after my mom...

2408
01:54:02,975 --> 01:54:04,616
or my dad.

2409
01:54:04,775 --> 01:54:06,216
But I do look after my brother.

2410
01:54:07,916 --> 01:54:10,445
"I wonder if I am his child."

2411
01:54:10,985 --> 01:54:11,985
I say that.

2412
01:54:11,986 --> 01:54:13,456
In my heart, she is my child.

2413
01:54:14,426 --> 01:54:16,555
Ju Yeon, you are in the frame.

2414
01:54:16,685 --> 01:54:18,996
He always stayed by Ju Yeon's side although I never asked him to.

2415
01:54:19,326 --> 01:54:21,565
Ju Yeon, show a cute act.

2416
01:54:22,265 --> 01:54:24,234
Everyone says that he changed...

2417
01:54:24,235 --> 01:54:25,395
my dirty diapers.

2418
01:54:25,935 --> 01:54:28,434
I have no memory of fighting with my brother.

2419
01:54:28,435 --> 01:54:31,506
I just got irritated with him at times.

2420
01:54:32,635 --> 01:54:34,445
One time, I cursed at him for the very first time.

2421
01:54:35,546 --> 01:54:37,105
I told him to get out since he was annoying.

2422
01:54:37,746 --> 01:54:38,875
Then my brother...

2423
01:54:38,876 --> 01:54:42,916
showed his playful smile and said,

2424
01:54:43,185 --> 01:54:45,285
"You can just say that I am annoying."

2425
01:54:45,286 --> 01:54:47,586
"You don't need to curse."

2426
01:54:49,555 --> 01:54:52,594
Yong Woo was fascinated by his sister.

2427
01:54:52,595 --> 01:54:54,126
He found her cute and cherished her.

2428
01:54:55,095 --> 01:54:56,926
Perhaps it's the power of love.

2429
01:54:57,095 --> 01:55:00,135
Ju Yeon's voice is louder than Yong Woo's.

2430
01:55:07,605 --> 01:55:08,875
- How cute. - She was so cute.

2431
01:55:08,876 --> 01:55:11,115
I bet she received a lot of love growing up.

2432
01:55:11,116 --> 01:55:12,445
- She was a princess. - Seriously.

2433
01:55:13,076 --> 01:55:14,185
How was she so pretty?

2434
01:55:16,985 --> 01:55:19,315
Ju Yeon is lovely.

2435
01:55:19,855 --> 01:55:22,786
What is my little lady doing?

2436
01:55:23,086 --> 01:55:25,926
- My little lady. - She is like a puppy at home.

2437
01:55:26,926 --> 01:55:27,966
Ju Yeon.

2438
01:55:30,796 --> 01:55:31,895
Peek-a-boo.

2439
01:55:35,765 --> 01:55:37,605
No matter where she goes, she is lovely...

2440
01:55:38,206 --> 01:55:39,275
and confident.

2441
01:55:39,605 --> 01:55:41,445
She is even in charge of family meetings.

2442
01:55:41,775 --> 01:55:45,246
She grew up as a cheerful and nice child.

2443
01:55:46,546 --> 01:55:47,546
- How cute. - How cute.

2444
01:55:47,547 --> 01:55:48,616
She looked just as she does now.

2445
01:55:49,046 --> 01:55:50,916
I am not a big fan of children, but she is so cute.

2446
01:55:51,015 --> 01:55:52,015
Seriously.

2447
01:55:52,355 --> 01:55:54,925
Watching their childhood videos...

2448
01:55:54,926 --> 01:55:56,125
makes me feel like a family.

2449
01:55:56,126 --> 01:55:57,286
- I know. - I feel that way for some reason.

2450
01:55:57,326 --> 01:56:01,865
(Ju Yeon's third birthday)

2451
01:56:01,866 --> 01:56:07,135
(Ju Yeon's third birthday)

2452
01:56:07,666 --> 01:56:08,765
Thank you.

2453
01:56:09,366 --> 01:56:10,666
Yong Woo, you are the best.

2454
01:56:12,706 --> 01:56:15,445
Since I was too young,

2455
01:56:16,105 --> 01:56:17,645
I couldn't read the room.

2456
01:56:17,845 --> 01:56:20,445
Only I spoke cheerfully.

2457
01:56:21,345 --> 01:56:24,086
My parents were young blood back then.

2458
01:56:24,355 --> 01:56:27,116
They didn't get along in some ways,

2459
01:56:27,855 --> 01:56:29,685
so things were a bit tough.

2460
01:56:32,025 --> 01:56:34,666
When I became a single parent,

2461
01:56:35,895 --> 01:56:39,135
my children were in high school and elementary school...

2462
01:56:39,895 --> 01:56:41,065
respectively.

2463
01:56:42,206 --> 01:56:46,775
I had no choice but to lead a busier life...

2464
01:56:47,076 --> 01:56:48,876
than other moms.

2465
01:56:49,876 --> 01:56:53,576
To her child, every mom...

2466
01:57:05,926 --> 01:57:07,926
wants to be the biggest hill.

2467
01:57:08,595 --> 01:57:12,496
She wants to be the biggest tree to depend on.

2468
01:57:12,666 --> 01:57:16,206
They grew up without a dad,

2469
01:57:17,466 --> 01:57:19,335
so I wanted to fill that void...

2470
01:57:19,336 --> 01:57:21,006
despite being a mom.

2471
01:57:21,805 --> 01:57:25,645
I thought, "Let's not get sick." I knew that getting sick...

2472
01:57:25,916 --> 01:57:27,115
would be...

2473
01:57:27,116 --> 01:57:28,715
(I knew that getting sick would be the biggest pain for them.)

2474
01:57:28,716 --> 01:57:30,786
the biggest pain for them.

2475
01:57:31,855 --> 01:57:33,116
"I must stay healthy."

2476
01:57:33,985 --> 01:57:37,384
"Let's live my life in a cheerful and lively way."

2477
01:57:37,385 --> 01:57:38,995
I always had that thought.

2478
01:57:38,996 --> 01:57:40,326
(She told herself that after becoming the breadwinner.)

2479
01:57:42,695 --> 01:57:44,296
They grew up well.

2480
01:57:45,595 --> 01:57:47,394
I think all three of us...

2481
01:57:47,395 --> 01:57:50,535
do 1-3rd of the dad's role for each other.

2482
01:57:50,536 --> 01:57:53,035
(I think all 3 of us do 1-3rd of the dad's role for each other.)

2483
01:57:53,036 --> 01:57:55,176
I bet Yong Woo played the dad's role as well.

2484
01:57:57,475 --> 01:57:58,875
Ju Yeon is so cheerful.

2485
01:57:58,876 --> 01:57:59,945
She grew up well.

2486
01:58:02,885 --> 01:58:07,116
Ever since I was little, my brother was someone dependable.

2487
01:58:07,515 --> 01:58:09,985
No matter what worry I had,

2488
01:58:10,996 --> 01:58:12,256
he accepted it.

2489
01:58:12,826 --> 01:58:16,065
No matter how tired he was, he didn't show his irritation.

2490
01:58:16,296 --> 01:58:18,496
He never scolded me for my worries.

2491
01:58:19,336 --> 01:58:21,205
He trusted me and waited for me.

2492
01:58:21,206 --> 01:58:22,805
He also provided solutions.

2493
01:58:22,935 --> 01:58:26,075
He was someone who fixed my problems.

2494
01:58:26,076 --> 01:58:28,145
He was like the second dad to me.

2495
01:58:30,145 --> 01:58:31,715
When I was little, I had this thought once...

2496
01:58:31,716 --> 01:58:33,645
since I was so thankful for my brother.

2497
01:58:35,286 --> 01:58:37,246
"In my next life,"

2498
01:58:37,385 --> 01:58:40,116
"I want to be his older sister and treat him well."

2499
01:58:40,256 --> 01:58:42,156
I had this thought once.

2500
01:58:42,885 --> 01:58:45,524
(When did you feel grateful for your brother?)

2501
01:58:45,525 --> 01:58:48,496
I had this fantasy about my graduation.

2502
01:58:48,826 --> 01:58:50,925
I thought it looked nice...

2503
01:58:50,926 --> 01:58:54,065
when other kids' families came and congratulated them.

2504
01:58:54,406 --> 01:58:55,765
When I graduated from elementary school,

2505
01:58:56,565 --> 01:58:58,576
my brother was in the army.

2506
01:58:59,576 --> 01:59:01,046
So he sent his friends.

2507
01:59:02,105 --> 01:59:03,345
I was so touched.

2508
01:59:03,445 --> 01:59:05,716
He couldn't do anything about not being there,

2509
01:59:05,916 --> 01:59:07,684
but he sent his friends.

2510
01:59:07,685 --> 01:59:09,314
(When Ju Yeon graduated from elementary school,)

2511
01:59:09,315 --> 01:59:10,944
(middle school, and high school,)

2512
01:59:10,945 --> 01:59:14,756
(Yong Woo's friends always came.)

2513
01:59:15,956 --> 01:59:17,554
- Will you take anything upstairs? - Yes.

2514
01:59:17,555 --> 01:59:18,594
- This one and... - This one?

2515
01:59:18,595 --> 01:59:19,955
I am sorry. This one and this one.

2516
01:59:19,956 --> 01:59:21,826
- Let's move this together first. - Okay.

2517
01:59:22,296 --> 01:59:23,826
I will help you.

2518
01:59:23,996 --> 01:59:25,264
- Give it to me. - Thank you.

2519
01:59:25,265 --> 01:59:26,594
I got this.

2520
01:59:26,595 --> 01:59:27,836
I will put it by the door.

2521
01:59:27,966 --> 01:59:30,235
- Okay. Thank you. - All right.

2522
01:59:30,935 --> 01:59:32,176
- Thank you. - All right.

2523
01:59:33,406 --> 01:59:35,604
I think it will be nice to eat fishcake as a side dish.

2524
01:59:35,605 --> 01:59:37,576
Shall we eat this?

2525
01:59:43,645 --> 01:59:47,184
Se Seung and Ju Yeon used the same room.

2526
01:59:47,185 --> 01:59:49,785
Perhaps that was why Yong Woo switched rooms with them.

2527
01:59:49,786 --> 01:59:51,295
He switched rooms...

2528
01:59:51,296 --> 01:59:52,594
- with Se Seung. - Yes. He gave them the bigger room.

2529
01:59:52,595 --> 01:59:54,826
- I have a lot to learn from him. - He is so cool.

2530
01:59:55,765 --> 01:59:57,065
He is such a great brother.

2531
01:59:57,595 --> 01:59:59,764
Listening to the backstory...

2532
01:59:59,765 --> 02:00:01,435
makes me see everyone in a different light.

2533
02:00:01,565 --> 02:00:03,105
- I know. - Each and everyone.

2534
02:00:05,235 --> 02:00:06,635
In the beginning,

2535
02:00:07,036 --> 02:00:09,145
I couldn't look at Ju Yeon's eyes in makeup.

2536
02:00:09,706 --> 02:00:11,006
Did she look like you in makeup?

2537
02:00:12,716 --> 02:00:13,844
Seriously.

2538
02:00:13,845 --> 02:00:16,015
Come to think of it,

2539
02:00:16,315 --> 02:00:20,256
I think it was an instinctive aversion.

2540
02:00:20,656 --> 02:00:22,426
She looked like me in a wig and makeup.

2541
02:00:24,025 --> 02:00:26,925
I am thinking a lot about how I can look...

2542
02:00:26,926 --> 02:00:28,326
less like him.

2543
02:00:29,765 --> 02:00:30,926
I can't think of a solution.

2544
02:00:31,166 --> 02:00:34,395
We share the same DNA.

2545
02:00:34,866 --> 02:00:39,336
I will do my best not to look like my brother.

2546
02:00:39,735 --> 02:00:41,676
I will do my best not to look at her.

2547
02:00:43,145 --> 02:00:45,275
I can really feel...

2548
02:00:45,416 --> 02:00:47,415
- There you go. - that this event...

2549
02:00:47,416 --> 02:00:50,985
strengthened the connection between the family members.

2550
02:01:00,456 --> 02:01:02,865
(Lee Yong Woo)

2551
02:01:02,866 --> 02:01:03,895
Okay.

2552
02:01:04,466 --> 02:01:09,036
(Lee Ju Yeon)

2553
02:01:09,935 --> 02:01:10,935
Shoot.

2554
02:01:12,176 --> 02:01:13,206
Hold on.

2555
02:01:18,445 --> 02:01:19,445
Come on.

2556
02:01:23,546 --> 02:01:24,655
What was that?

2557
02:01:24,656 --> 02:01:26,256
No.

2558
02:01:26,385 --> 02:01:28,054
Take this.

2559
02:01:28,055 --> 02:01:29,126
How many times...

2560
02:01:32,826 --> 02:01:35,325
Don't hit the ball like this.

2561
02:01:35,326 --> 02:01:37,195
- I plan to hit it like this. - Spin it.

2562
02:01:41,536 --> 02:01:43,666
(Siblings' Room)

2563
02:01:45,805 --> 02:01:47,774
(Yo)

2564
02:01:47,775 --> 02:01:48,876
(Ay, yo)

2565
02:01:49,645 --> 02:01:50,676
Hey.

2566
02:01:51,046 --> 02:01:53,115
How are things?

2567
02:01:53,116 --> 02:01:55,814
I think you are enjoying it much more.

2568
02:01:55,815 --> 02:01:56,885
- Me? - Yes.

2569
02:01:57,345 --> 02:01:59,484
- Seriously. - Yes. I am having a lot of fun.

2570
02:01:59,485 --> 02:02:00,586
Same here.

2571
02:02:01,116 --> 02:02:02,126
It's fun.

2572
02:02:02,586 --> 02:02:04,055
People's reactions are fun too.

2573
02:02:04,286 --> 02:02:05,325
Yes.

2574
02:02:05,326 --> 02:02:06,655
You were doing very well.

2575
02:02:06,656 --> 02:02:07,656
- Really? - Yes.

2576
02:02:07,657 --> 02:02:09,094
- Do you think I did well? - Yes.

2577
02:02:09,095 --> 02:02:10,795
When I sat in front of you,

2578
02:02:10,796 --> 02:02:12,735
I looked over to see how you were doing.

2579
02:02:12,895 --> 02:02:15,035
You met my eyes and talked to me...

2580
02:02:15,036 --> 02:02:16,635
- without reservation. - Of course.

2581
02:02:16,765 --> 02:02:18,905
You called me by my name.

2582
02:02:18,906 --> 02:02:19,906
Of course.

2583
02:02:20,135 --> 02:02:22,345
From time to time,

2584
02:02:23,046 --> 02:02:24,676
you suddenly spoke casually to me.

2585
02:02:24,775 --> 02:02:26,015
- Did I do that? - Yes.

2586
02:02:26,475 --> 02:02:27,676
You looked young.

2587
02:02:28,645 --> 02:02:29,785
- I am young. - Yes.

2588
02:02:29,786 --> 02:02:31,916
You looked young.

2589
02:02:32,555 --> 02:02:34,156
Please refrain from answering me.

2590
02:02:34,656 --> 02:02:36,354
- What do you mean? - When I talk to myself...

2591
02:02:36,355 --> 02:02:38,194
- Okay. - You answer without thinking.

2592
02:02:38,195 --> 02:02:39,295
- "Right." - Really?

2593
02:02:39,296 --> 02:02:41,225
- "Right." - Right.

2594
02:02:41,525 --> 02:02:43,126
Then you suddenly go back to speaking formally to me.

2595
02:02:43,225 --> 02:02:44,225
(I see.)

2596
02:02:44,226 --> 02:02:45,434
You do it without thinking.

2597
02:02:45,435 --> 02:02:46,594
Pay attention.

2598
02:02:46,595 --> 02:02:48,336
(Moving their belongings)

2599
02:02:48,605 --> 02:02:49,866
Thank you.

2600
02:02:50,435 --> 02:02:51,876
I see that it's yours.

2601
02:02:54,906 --> 02:02:57,575
If you could check out my running form...

2602
02:02:57,576 --> 02:02:59,445
Right. Run together.

2603
02:02:59,716 --> 02:03:02,144
It's hard to get the upper body in the right position.

2604
02:03:02,145 --> 02:03:04,715
Please be more careful.

2605
02:03:04,716 --> 02:03:07,615
- Okay, Ju Yeon. - Okay.

2606
02:03:07,616 --> 02:03:09,025
- Okay, Ju Yeon. - Okay.

2607
02:03:09,586 --> 02:03:10,656
So...

2608
02:03:10,926 --> 02:03:13,426
How does it feel to place 1st in terms of the 1st impression?

2609
02:03:14,456 --> 02:03:17,126
- Me? - Yes. Did you expect the result?

2610
02:03:17,395 --> 02:03:19,094
I didn't expect the result.

2611
02:03:19,095 --> 02:03:20,935
My lips went up...

2612
02:03:21,536 --> 02:03:22,866
- in a smile. - You couldn't hide it?

2613
02:03:23,206 --> 02:03:25,774
- I tried my best to hide it. - You tried my best to hide it.

2614
02:03:25,775 --> 02:03:27,735
- I was grateful. - Right.

2615
02:03:27,975 --> 02:03:29,975
Is there anyone you like?

2616
02:03:30,305 --> 02:03:35,085
Judging by the first impression, there is someone I like.

2617
02:03:35,086 --> 02:03:36,286
I see.

2618
02:03:36,746 --> 02:03:38,485
- Judging by the first impression? - How about you?

2619
02:03:39,786 --> 02:03:43,426
- There is someone. - Is there someone?

2620
02:03:44,126 --> 02:03:46,225
So, who is the one you like?

2621
02:03:46,555 --> 02:03:47,555
Guess.

2622
02:03:48,426 --> 02:03:52,366
I sent the message saying that it was Cho A.

2623
02:03:52,895 --> 02:03:53,935
Do you know why?

2624
02:03:54,866 --> 02:03:58,134
Cho A looks a bit like Han Go Eun.

2625
02:03:58,135 --> 02:03:59,205
She has that vibe.

2626
02:03:59,206 --> 02:04:00,676
- She is elegant. - Yes.

2627
02:04:01,275 --> 02:04:02,845
- Did I guess correctly? - You know...

2628
02:04:06,076 --> 02:04:07,116
Really?

2629
02:04:07,275 --> 02:04:08,445
- Did I guess correctly? - You know,

2630
02:04:08,815 --> 02:04:12,055
it was the first time in a long while...

2631
02:04:12,286 --> 02:04:16,725
I faced someone with that vibe.

2632
02:04:17,586 --> 02:04:20,395
- I got that feeling. - I guessed correctly right away.

2633
02:04:20,996 --> 02:04:23,094
To be honest,

2634
02:04:23,095 --> 02:04:27,135
Cho A is the ideal type I pictured for a long time.

2635
02:04:27,895 --> 02:04:29,866
So I found it fascinating.

2636
02:04:31,235 --> 02:04:32,235
It's incredible.

2637
02:04:32,576 --> 02:04:33,705
- Really? - Really?

2638
02:04:33,706 --> 02:04:35,905
Gosh, Ju Yeon was spot on.

2639
02:04:35,906 --> 02:04:37,605
- She guessed correctly. - That's right.

2640
02:04:37,845 --> 02:04:39,945
That was why he kept talking about chansons.

2641
02:04:40,515 --> 02:04:42,915
- I see. - I see.

2642
02:04:42,916 --> 02:04:44,514
Talking about chansons was his way of flirting.

2643
02:04:44,515 --> 02:04:46,085
- That's right. - She guessed correctly.

2644
02:04:46,086 --> 02:04:49,554
Oh, no. Cho A picked Jung Sub.

2645
02:04:49,555 --> 02:04:53,425
Han Go Eun is my ideal type in terms of looks.

2646
02:04:53,426 --> 02:04:56,125
She has been my ideal type for a long time.

2647
02:04:56,126 --> 02:04:57,225
That image.

2648
02:04:57,525 --> 02:04:59,194
- Hello. - Hello.

2649
02:04:59,195 --> 02:05:01,336
- Hello. - Hello.

2650
02:05:02,906 --> 02:05:05,406
(He met his long-time ideal type here today.)

2651
02:05:05,935 --> 02:05:08,176
My name is Yong Woo.

2652
02:05:08,645 --> 02:05:10,845
- Yong Woo. - Yes, it's Yong Woo.

2653
02:05:11,076 --> 02:05:12,116
What's your name?

2654
02:05:12,416 --> 02:05:13,814
My name is Cho A.

2655
02:05:13,815 --> 02:05:15,416
- Cho A. - Yes.

2656
02:05:18,756 --> 02:05:20,086
(Glancing over)

2657
02:05:23,086 --> 02:05:25,826
Yes, the water is cold.

2658
02:05:27,496 --> 02:05:29,525
- I knew it. - Impressive.

2659
02:05:29,966 --> 02:05:33,595
You have a pretty good sense.

2660
02:05:33,796 --> 02:05:36,235
- That's me. - Not bad.

2661
02:05:36,466 --> 02:05:39,734
We didn't have much time to talk.

2662
02:05:39,735 --> 02:05:41,474
I tried to talk to her,

2663
02:05:41,475 --> 02:05:44,045
but the conversation didn't last long.

2664
02:05:44,046 --> 02:05:46,445
- It's the first day, after all. - You entered last too.

2665
02:05:46,676 --> 02:05:48,815
- Whom did you pick? - As for me...

2666
02:05:50,216 --> 02:05:52,415
- Jae Hyung. - Jae Hyung?

2667
02:05:52,416 --> 02:05:53,656
Jae Hyung was...

2668
02:05:54,116 --> 02:05:55,625
my guess.

2669
02:05:55,626 --> 02:05:58,125
He seemed to be good...

2670
02:05:58,126 --> 02:06:00,955
at leading the situation.

2671
02:06:00,956 --> 02:06:04,265
So I thought, "Isn't it Jae Hyung?"

2672
02:06:08,105 --> 02:06:09,435
I see that I am completely wrong.

2673
02:06:12,475 --> 02:06:13,536
So funny.

2674
02:06:18,845 --> 02:06:20,144
I see that I am completely wrong.

2675
02:06:20,145 --> 02:06:22,514
- You are completely wrong. - I see that I am completely wrong.

2676
02:06:22,515 --> 02:06:25,314
- You are completely wrong. - I wrote his name...

2677
02:06:25,315 --> 02:06:26,885
as "Jae Hyun."

2678
02:06:27,216 --> 02:06:28,256
Is it Jae Hyun?

2679
02:06:29,756 --> 02:06:31,456
Who is it then?

2680
02:06:32,225 --> 02:06:33,926
It's Cheol Hyeon.

2681
02:06:34,126 --> 02:06:36,365
Cheol Hyeon seemed like a funny man when I talked to him.

2682
02:06:36,366 --> 02:06:37,626
He is eccentric.

2683
02:06:37,966 --> 02:06:39,065
Quite so.

2684
02:06:39,765 --> 02:06:40,836
In a charming way.

2685
02:06:41,635 --> 02:06:43,935
He seemed to be very eccentric.

2686
02:06:45,906 --> 02:06:47,104
(Deliver the Cupid Message to your sibling.)

2687
02:06:47,105 --> 02:06:49,305
- I received an instruction. - Really?

2688
02:06:50,975 --> 02:06:52,116
Okay.

2689
02:06:52,576 --> 02:06:53,645
I didn't receive it.

2690
02:06:53,845 --> 02:06:55,916
I see that only I received it.

2691
02:06:57,046 --> 02:06:58,115
I am envious.

2692
02:06:58,116 --> 02:07:00,616
- I am curious. - I am curious.

2693
02:07:03,826 --> 02:07:06,625
- Were you supposed to share it? - Did you understand what we did?

2694
02:07:06,626 --> 02:07:08,495
We talked about the Cupid...

2695
02:07:08,496 --> 02:07:10,326
Would you stop making that facial expression?

2696
02:07:10,725 --> 02:07:12,694
Did you understand that Cupid thing?

2697
02:07:12,695 --> 02:07:15,734
Yes. Pretty much.

2698
02:07:15,735 --> 02:07:16,735
Listen.

2699
02:07:17,336 --> 02:07:19,435
If a woman likes you.

2700
02:07:20,206 --> 02:07:23,774
she will send a message to someone who seems like your sibling.

2701
02:07:23,775 --> 02:07:25,876
Female participants will do that.

2702
02:07:27,645 --> 02:07:31,616
Okay. So if a woman likes me,

2703
02:07:31,916 --> 02:07:34,514
she will send a message to someone who seems like my sibling.

2704
02:07:34,515 --> 02:07:35,626
- Did I get that right? - Yes.

2705
02:07:36,126 --> 02:07:38,854
You know, I saw it coming.

2706
02:07:38,855 --> 02:07:39,926
Okay.

2707
02:07:40,256 --> 02:07:43,525
The two of us look the same.

2708
02:07:45,395 --> 02:07:46,435
Seriously.

2709
02:07:47,265 --> 02:07:48,405
I see.

2710
02:07:48,406 --> 02:07:51,365
No. Some people don't know.

2711
02:07:51,366 --> 02:07:52,775
Cho A doesn't know.

2712
02:07:53,076 --> 02:07:54,375
How does she not know?

2713
02:07:54,376 --> 02:07:55,875
- Cho A is... - I know.

2714
02:07:55,876 --> 02:07:57,705
Yong Woo likes Cho A,

2715
02:07:57,706 --> 02:08:00,815
- but Cho A has no interest in him. - I know.

2716
02:08:01,416 --> 02:08:04,716
The two of us look the same.

2717
02:08:06,685 --> 02:08:09,684
Seriously. We look the same.

2718
02:08:09,685 --> 02:08:12,826
So I thought that everyone must have guessed.

2719
02:08:13,256 --> 02:08:17,125
And you have good looks...

2720
02:08:17,126 --> 02:08:18,666
because you resemble me.

2721
02:08:20,135 --> 02:08:22,365
- Isn't it the other way around? - No.

2722
02:08:22,366 --> 02:08:24,065
You have good looks,

2723
02:08:25,006 --> 02:08:27,035
so I thought that many female participants...

2724
02:08:27,036 --> 02:08:28,345
would give me a note.

2725
02:08:29,305 --> 02:08:30,746
It was as I expected.

2726
02:08:32,376 --> 02:08:33,376
What?

2727
02:08:34,116 --> 02:08:36,644
- You received three votes. - Are you serious?

2728
02:08:36,645 --> 02:08:39,884
- I got all the notes. - I can't believe it.

2729
02:08:39,885 --> 02:08:41,725
(He can't hide his happiness.)

2730
02:08:41,956 --> 02:08:43,456
He understood it now.

2731
02:08:43,985 --> 02:08:45,925
- He became cocky. Look at that. - What?

2732
02:08:45,926 --> 02:08:47,826
He became cocky.

2733
02:08:47,926 --> 02:08:49,064
He is smiling now.

2734
02:08:49,065 --> 02:08:51,934
He doesn't know that not all three votes are...

2735
02:08:51,935 --> 02:08:55,435
- for him. - That's right.

2736
02:08:55,805 --> 02:08:58,205
- You received three votes. - Are you serious?

2737
02:08:58,206 --> 02:09:01,535
- I got all the notes. - I can't believe it.

2738
02:09:01,536 --> 02:09:04,205
(The siblings are confused.)

2739
02:09:04,206 --> 02:09:06,444
- I got all the notes. - Are you serious?

2740
02:09:06,445 --> 02:09:08,815
I will read them now.

2741
02:09:09,485 --> 02:09:10,545
What will you read?

2742
02:09:10,546 --> 02:09:11,814
- The notes. - Did they write messages?

2743
02:09:11,815 --> 02:09:14,984
They wrote a message to ask you out...

2744
02:09:14,985 --> 02:09:16,985
on a date.

2745
02:09:17,185 --> 02:09:19,224
- So... - This is so much fun.

2746
02:09:19,225 --> 02:09:20,656
Right? This is so much fun.

2747
02:09:21,256 --> 02:09:22,666
- This is so much fun. - Yes.

2748
02:09:23,225 --> 02:09:27,065
Seriously, I was so happy.

2749
02:09:27,296 --> 02:09:29,305
I thought, "I will do my best."

2750
02:09:29,666 --> 02:09:31,135
I was to motivated.

2751
02:09:32,006 --> 02:09:34,575
Things were so much fun from the start.

2752
02:09:34,576 --> 02:09:36,576
Thanks to the messages,

2753
02:09:36,945 --> 02:09:39,076
I became even more absorbed.

2754
02:09:40,015 --> 02:09:41,076
Okay.

2755
02:09:41,275 --> 02:09:43,215
- These messages... - I will be serious.

2756
02:09:43,216 --> 02:09:44,485
Will you read them to me?

2757
02:09:44,985 --> 02:09:46,884
- There are different ways. - Okay.

2758
02:09:46,885 --> 02:09:49,554
- You can go out on a date... - Okay.

2759
02:09:49,555 --> 02:09:52,195
- with a woman I choose. - Okay.

2760
02:09:52,355 --> 02:09:54,825
We can read the three messages together...

2761
02:09:54,826 --> 02:09:56,425
and discuss whom you should pick.

2762
02:09:56,426 --> 02:09:57,625
- That sounds fun. - Right?

2763
02:09:57,626 --> 02:09:59,234
Let's do that.

2764
02:09:59,235 --> 02:10:00,235
(They decide to discuss the matter together.)

2765
02:10:00,236 --> 02:10:01,966
- These are the three notes. - Okay.

2766
02:10:03,666 --> 02:10:05,675
"I think our personalities match."

2767
02:10:05,676 --> 02:10:07,505
"Let's have fun on our date."

2768
02:10:07,506 --> 02:10:09,745
"I hope you're the one I want to give this note to."

2769
02:10:09,746 --> 02:10:12,575
Despite being cautious, she made a brave move.

2770
02:10:12,576 --> 02:10:14,246
- I agree with you. - It was perfect, right?

2771
02:10:14,716 --> 02:10:16,444
"I hope you're the one I want to give this note to."

2772
02:10:16,445 --> 02:10:20,855
That means we might not look alike.

2773
02:10:21,826 --> 02:10:23,125
I hope that's the case.

2774
02:10:23,126 --> 02:10:26,055
Perhaps she was confused since you resembled someone else.

2775
02:10:26,355 --> 02:10:27,895
(Correct)

2776
02:10:29,126 --> 02:10:32,764
Here. "Thanks to you, today went well."

2777
02:10:32,765 --> 02:10:34,265
"Let's have fun here."

2778
02:10:34,635 --> 02:10:37,104
- She has a refreshing vibe. - Yes.

2779
02:10:37,105 --> 02:10:39,604
- She has a refreshing vibe. - Look at that emoji.

2780
02:10:39,605 --> 02:10:42,246
Yes. She drew a winking emoji.

2781
02:10:42,576 --> 02:10:44,375
"It's chilly."

2782
02:10:44,376 --> 02:10:46,344
"Would you like to have a cup of warm tea with me?"

2783
02:10:46,345 --> 02:10:47,345
(To Jung Sub, from Cho A)

2784
02:10:47,346 --> 02:10:48,385
It has a warm vibe.

2785
02:10:48,645 --> 02:10:50,644
- It has a warm vibe. - It's cozy.

2786
02:10:50,645 --> 02:10:52,555
It's cozy and serious.

2787
02:10:53,756 --> 02:10:55,956
Which one do you like?

2788
02:10:58,355 --> 02:10:59,956
I think I know.

2789
02:11:00,595 --> 02:11:03,024
- Just 1. You know, right? - I know who 1 person is.

2790
02:11:03,025 --> 02:11:05,064
I bet it's the same person.

2791
02:11:05,065 --> 02:11:06,134
In the count of three,

2792
02:11:06,135 --> 02:11:07,594
shall we say the name and point to the message?

2793
02:11:07,595 --> 02:11:11,435
We can say one syllable of her name.

2794
02:11:13,506 --> 02:11:15,104
- Shall we point to it? - Yes.

2795
02:11:15,105 --> 02:11:16,205
One, two, three.

2796
02:11:16,206 --> 02:11:17,644
- Seung. What? - What?

2797
02:11:17,645 --> 02:11:19,076
This is from Se Seung and this is from Cho A.

2798
02:11:20,076 --> 02:11:21,786
Yes. Se Seung and Cho A.

2799
02:11:22,445 --> 02:11:23,944
- Really? - Yes. This is from Se Seung.

2800
02:11:23,945 --> 02:11:26,054
I think this is...

2801
02:11:26,055 --> 02:11:27,116
(Yong Woo predicted this message to be Cho A's.)

2802
02:11:27,385 --> 02:11:28,984
I think this is Cho A's.

2803
02:11:28,985 --> 02:11:30,224
- Cho A's, right? - Yes.

2804
02:11:30,225 --> 02:11:31,326
I agree.

2805
02:11:32,126 --> 02:11:33,655
Whom do you think...

2806
02:11:33,656 --> 02:11:36,295
would have a fun date with me?

2807
02:11:36,296 --> 02:11:37,695
- A fun date? - Yes.

2808
02:11:38,296 --> 02:11:39,595
Here is the thing.

2809
02:11:40,095 --> 02:11:42,105
Since forever ago,

2810
02:11:42,406 --> 02:11:45,934
I have liked Han Go Eun.

2811
02:11:45,935 --> 02:11:47,505
(The siblings have the same taste.)

2812
02:11:47,506 --> 02:11:50,706
From the moment I saw Cho A, I thought,

2813
02:11:52,345 --> 02:11:54,216
- "She is the one." - You got that hunch.

2814
02:11:55,046 --> 02:11:56,286
I thought, "She is the one."

2815
02:11:56,546 --> 02:11:57,546
(He becomes certain about his choice.)

2816
02:11:57,547 --> 02:11:59,684
- Okay. - I had that thought.

2817
02:11:59,685 --> 02:12:01,256
It would be nice to get to know her.

2818
02:12:02,185 --> 02:12:03,485
- This one. - Yes.

2819
02:12:03,855 --> 02:12:05,125
"The weather is chilly."

2820
02:12:05,126 --> 02:12:07,155
- We need to choose a message. - That's right.

2821
02:12:07,156 --> 02:12:09,764
- It might not be her. - Right. It might not be her.

2822
02:12:09,765 --> 02:12:11,365
Even if it isn't her, it will be fun.

2823
02:12:11,366 --> 02:12:12,595
- That's right. - Right?

2824
02:12:13,635 --> 02:12:15,805
Let's see if we guessed correctly.

2825
02:12:16,406 --> 02:12:17,435
Okay.

2826
02:12:18,906 --> 02:12:22,406
I think I chose the right message.

2827
02:12:22,975 --> 02:12:25,444
But I can't be sure since it's just a hunch. It's fun.

2828
02:12:25,445 --> 02:12:28,375
There is a big chance the message isn't from her.

2829
02:12:28,376 --> 02:12:32,015
It was fun to guess.

2830
02:12:32,616 --> 02:12:33,956
I think doing it with Ju Yeon...

2831
02:12:34,355 --> 02:12:36,826
made it twice as fun.

2832
02:12:38,826 --> 02:12:41,995
Oh, no. I got chills.

2833
02:12:41,996 --> 02:12:44,825
So Yong Woo picked Cho A's message...

2834
02:12:44,826 --> 02:12:47,064
- with his hunch. - That's right.

2835
02:12:47,065 --> 02:12:48,665
- That's right. - My goodness.

2836
02:12:48,666 --> 02:12:50,666
From the vibe of the sentences...

2837
02:12:51,305 --> 02:12:54,335
- Yes. - He connected them to his crush...

2838
02:12:54,336 --> 02:12:56,505
and picked the right message. But what's scary is...

2839
02:12:56,506 --> 02:12:57,804
It wasn't for him.

2840
02:12:57,805 --> 02:13:00,215
- It wasn't for him. - Cho A didn't pick him.

2841
02:13:00,216 --> 02:13:01,274
How did this happen?

2842
02:13:01,275 --> 02:13:03,215
He might seduce Cho A.

2843
02:13:03,216 --> 02:13:04,585
- That's right. - It could happen.

2844
02:13:04,586 --> 02:13:06,116
He got the opportunity.

2845
02:13:06,315 --> 02:13:09,524
I hope Yong Woo would find out soon that the message wasn't meant...

2846
02:13:09,525 --> 02:13:11,455
- for him. - Same here.

2847
02:13:11,456 --> 02:13:13,724
- I can't wait to see his reaction. - He would be so sad.

2848
02:13:13,725 --> 02:13:15,826
He wouldn't know until he watches this episode.

2849
02:13:15,926 --> 02:13:17,595
There is a chance he still doesn't know.

2850
02:13:17,926 --> 02:13:19,234
He might find out...

2851
02:13:19,235 --> 02:13:21,366
- as he watches this episode. - He will know from now on.

2852
02:13:21,796 --> 02:13:23,506
How did he pick the right message?

2853
02:13:23,666 --> 02:13:26,376
He failed to guess the man his sister was interested in,

2854
02:13:27,076 --> 02:13:29,406
but he found Cho A's message right away.

2855
02:13:30,805 --> 02:13:33,576
- I will deliver it to you. - Do I get to keep it?

2856
02:13:35,786 --> 02:13:37,844
"Put the rest of the messages on the upper drawer..."

2857
02:13:37,845 --> 02:13:39,915
"of the chest with the yellow lamp."

2858
02:13:39,916 --> 02:13:41,015
There it is.

2859
02:13:44,485 --> 02:13:47,695
(He puts Se Seung and Yun Ha's messages in the drawer.)

2860
02:13:49,126 --> 02:13:50,895
- Thank you very much. - Okay.

2861
02:13:51,366 --> 02:13:53,134
- I was thanking them. - Okay.

2862
02:13:53,135 --> 02:13:55,064
Not all expressions of gratitude are intended for you.

2863
02:13:55,065 --> 02:13:56,836
You should thank me too.

2864
02:13:56,906 --> 02:13:58,535
(Thank you.)

2865
02:13:58,536 --> 02:13:59,576
Namaste.

2866
02:14:00,006 --> 02:14:02,706
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2867
02:14:03,145 --> 02:14:04,246
Stay healthy.

2868
02:14:06,116 --> 02:14:11,956
(Cho A's message for Jung Sub was delivered to Yong Woo.)

2869
02:14:14,456 --> 02:14:15,554
(My goodness)

2870
02:14:15,555 --> 02:14:17,055
- What is better? - Okay.

2871
02:14:18,355 --> 02:14:20,724
(He looked cool because he was so good at bowling.)

2872
02:14:20,725 --> 02:14:23,725
(Watching the siblings being romantic)

2873
02:14:28,036 --> 02:14:29,505
(Running away)

2874
02:14:29,506 --> 02:14:30,764
(What? Hold on.)

2875
02:14:30,765 --> 02:14:31,836
(We got a message.)

2876
02:14:32,275 --> 02:14:33,305
Really?

2877
02:14:34,105 --> 02:14:36,046
(They deliver their feelings for the first time.)

2878
02:14:36,206 --> 02:14:37,745
(I thought about it a lot.)

2879
02:14:37,746 --> 02:14:39,576
(He was the one who came to mind first.)

2880
02:14:39,845 --> 02:14:41,474
(This is really hard.)

2881
02:14:41,475 --> 02:14:43,885
(I didn't hesitate.)

2882
02:14:44,385 --> 02:14:47,786
(And two pairs of siblings haven't been revealed yet.)

2883
02:14:48,086 --> 02:14:49,326
(Hello)

2884
02:14:52,525 --> 02:14:53,594
(Are things okay?)

2885
02:14:53,595 --> 02:14:54,655
(Are things okay?)

2886
02:14:54,656 --> 02:14:56,725
(It feels a bit strange, right?)

2887
02:14:57,025 --> 02:14:58,836
(Is there anyone you like?)
