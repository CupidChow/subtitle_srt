1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,700
(Gosh, look at their legs.)

2
00:00:01,701 --> 00:00:03,247
(They're like Yun Jae.)

3
00:00:03,248 --> 00:00:04,548
(This was the most fun I had since we started filming.)

4
00:00:06,278 --> 00:00:09,319
(He was the type of person that I was naturally attracted to.)

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,018
(At that moment, I thought, "She's the one.")

6
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:15,129
(After the dates, they had to choose someone for the text message.)

7
00:00:15,328 --> 00:00:18,258
(Jae Hyung and Ji Won chose each other.)

8
00:00:18,629 --> 00:00:22,268
(Should I make kimchi for you?)

9
00:00:22,269 --> 00:00:24,527
(When I received the text,)

10
00:00:24,528 --> 00:00:26,997
(it didn't sound like Yong Woo at all.)

11
00:00:26,998 --> 00:00:29,968
(What does he mean by that?)

12
00:00:30,168 --> 00:00:33,537
(They weren't on the same wavelength anymore.)

13
00:00:33,538 --> 00:00:34,847
"To make your decision without any regrets..."

14
00:00:34,848 --> 00:00:37,508
(They will go on a date with someone...)

15
00:00:37,509 --> 00:00:39,418
(they haven't gone on a date.)

16
00:00:39,619 --> 00:00:40,818
(Sighing)

17
00:00:41,418 --> 00:00:42,418
(Whom will he choose?)

18
00:00:42,419 --> 00:00:43,847
(Number 1, Ju Yeon.)

19
00:00:43,848 --> 00:00:46,857
(Yun Jae and Ju Yeon will be going on a date.)

20
00:00:46,858 --> 00:00:48,558
(Due to the first decision made by Yun Jae,)

21
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,059
(the rest of you were automatically matched as couples.)

22
00:00:50,788 --> 00:00:53,228
(This could cause some confusion.)

23
00:00:53,229 --> 00:00:55,098
(To determine the date budget ranking,)

24
00:00:55,099 --> 00:00:57,868
(the Women's Chicken Fight Competition was held.)

25
00:00:57,869 --> 00:00:59,868
(I looked at her with killing intent in my eyes.)

26
00:00:59,869 --> 00:01:01,438
(I thought, "I must win.")

27
00:01:03,138 --> 00:01:04,209
(Let's end it fast.)

28
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,348
(Ji Won and Jung Sub get 50 dollars.)

29
00:01:08,349 --> 00:01:10,478
(Cho A and Jae Hyung get 100 dollars.)

30
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,318
(Ju Yeon and Yun Jae get 300 dollars.)

31
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:14,217
(Yun Ha and Yong Woo get 500 dollars.)

32
00:01:14,218 --> 00:01:16,518
(Se Seung and Cheol Hyeon get 1,000 dollars.)

33
00:01:16,718 --> 00:01:18,687
(It came with a luxury date.)

34
00:01:18,688 --> 00:01:20,017
(I was really excited about that.)

35
00:01:20,018 --> 00:01:22,059
(I am glad that I got a good rest yesterday.)

36
00:01:22,589 --> 00:01:26,858
(Their third dates in Singapore will begin now.)

37
00:01:27,899 --> 00:01:29,699
- It's so hot. - Are you going to wear that?

38
00:01:29,768 --> 00:01:30,928
- Yes. Why? - Okay.

39
00:01:30,929 --> 00:01:31,937
Do you want to wear a matching outfit?

40
00:01:31,938 --> 00:01:33,069
- Yes. - Okay.

41
00:01:33,298 --> 00:01:36,039
(Yun Ha begins picking out her outfit for her date.)

42
00:01:38,509 --> 00:01:40,578
(The first outfit: The off-the-shoulder blouse)

43
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:43,378
- Do I look okay? - Yes. Not bad.

44
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:44,949
What else do you have other than the black blouse?

45
00:01:45,048 --> 00:01:48,018
I have a dress that looks super girly.

46
00:01:48,688 --> 00:01:50,589
(The second outfit: The super girly dress)

47
00:01:51,989 --> 00:01:53,319
Hey.

48
00:01:56,028 --> 00:01:57,489
What's the white thing underneath the dress?

49
00:01:58,089 --> 00:02:00,098
It's a Western-style dress. A dress from the Wild West.

50
00:02:03,068 --> 00:02:06,098
Here's why. Wearing a shirt...

51
00:02:06,498 --> 00:02:08,508
- Let me see. - How do I look?

52
00:02:08,709 --> 00:02:09,769
No.

53
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,908
You look like a girl in "Indiana Jones."

54
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:16,248
Or what about this? This doesn't look bad, right?

55
00:02:16,378 --> 00:02:18,049
- That's nice too. - Right?

56
00:02:18,109 --> 00:02:20,247
But it looks similar to the outfit I wore yesterday.

57
00:02:20,248 --> 00:02:21,278
Hurry up.

58
00:02:21,549 --> 00:02:23,649
(The fifth outfit: A loose maxi dress)

59
00:02:25,119 --> 00:02:26,119
Jung Sub.

60
00:02:26,559 --> 00:02:27,589
Yes.

61
00:02:29,228 --> 00:02:31,488
Great. You look very nice.

62
00:02:31,489 --> 00:02:33,258
- Really? - Yes. You look great in white.

63
00:02:33,359 --> 00:02:34,598
The shoes too.

64
00:02:36,399 --> 00:02:38,839
(She picks out a cardigan too.)

65
00:02:39,998 --> 00:02:42,609
Gosh. This is too white.

66
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,108
- How beautiful. - Does this look better?

67
00:02:46,109 --> 00:02:47,139
Yes.

68
00:02:47,679 --> 00:02:50,649
(She finally settles on the outfit after contemplating for 40 minutes.)

69
00:02:53,978 --> 00:02:56,187
This room is nice and breezy. You guys have a fan too.

70
00:02:56,188 --> 00:02:59,089
Let me go down and see what we have in the fridge.

71
00:02:59,359 --> 00:03:00,359
Gosh.

72
00:03:03,688 --> 00:03:05,497
- Jung Sub. - Yes.

73
00:03:05,498 --> 00:03:08,058
Do you like cream pasta or tomato pasta?

74
00:03:08,059 --> 00:03:09,227
I like TP.

75
00:03:09,228 --> 00:03:10,628
TP? Okay.

76
00:03:11,068 --> 00:03:12,468
(He's hovering around her again.)

77
00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:15,907
- Then what should we do first? - What are you doing?

78
00:03:15,908 --> 00:03:18,239
Steak and pasta.

79
00:03:18,809 --> 00:03:20,278
(Ji Won wants to put on an apron.)

80
00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:21,908
- What is this? - What are you doing?

81
00:03:23,679 --> 00:03:26,248
- How do I put this on? - Something went wrong big time.

82
00:03:26,419 --> 00:03:27,478
That's right.

83
00:03:29,649 --> 00:03:30,718
This is right.

84
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:33,019
Then I should tighten these.

85
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:36,088
What is this?

86
00:03:36,089 --> 00:03:37,389
- I see. This is it. - I see.

87
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:40,628
Okay.

88
00:03:41,258 --> 00:03:42,329
(Groaning)

89
00:03:46,098 --> 00:03:47,169
That was a sharp scream.

90
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:48,809
(Shrieking)

91
00:03:51,309 --> 00:03:52,309
Thanks.

92
00:03:54,038 --> 00:03:56,549
This is nice. It's like I'm going to cook something grand.

93
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:58,818
- That's how it feels. - You're building up expectations.

94
00:03:59,878 --> 00:04:01,019
I should watch you cook before I go.

95
00:04:02,448 --> 00:04:04,817
Gosh. He's glued to her when Jung Sub is there.

96
00:04:04,818 --> 00:04:06,887
Seriously. He keeps circling around her.

97
00:04:06,888 --> 00:04:08,429
He's building a barrier between Jung Sub and her.

98
00:04:08,559 --> 00:04:10,958
- Oh, no. He's... - This feels weird.

99
00:04:11,188 --> 00:04:13,098
Those two will go on a date.

100
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:14,799
Their date already has begun.

101
00:04:14,859 --> 00:04:17,098
- I think it already started. - Yes, it already started.

102
00:04:17,099 --> 00:04:18,267
Will the three of them go on a date?

103
00:04:18,268 --> 00:04:19,337
(A three-people date in the kitchen)

104
00:04:19,338 --> 00:04:22,337
Are you going to add the steak to the tomato pasta?

105
00:04:22,338 --> 00:04:23,338
Tomato pasta with meat?

106
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:24,767
- I'll cook them separately. - Separately.

107
00:04:24,768 --> 00:04:27,039
- Yes. I'll try to make it tasty. - Do you have something in mind?

108
00:04:28,109 --> 00:04:29,808
I'll try to disappear.

109
00:04:29,809 --> 00:04:31,948
- Ta-da. - I'll try to do a good job.

110
00:04:32,349 --> 00:04:33,577
- I'll try... - I'll give it a try.

111
00:04:33,578 --> 00:04:35,119
- to become a pencil. - I can't wait.

112
00:04:35,148 --> 00:04:39,158
I'm guilty of losing the Chicken Leg Competition.

113
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:40,258
I'll cook for us.

114
00:04:41,059 --> 00:04:42,087
- Gosh, no. - But it's nice...

115
00:04:42,088 --> 00:04:43,127
we can go on a date with someone we like.

116
00:04:43,128 --> 00:04:44,828
Right. That's true.

117
00:04:45,258 --> 00:04:46,898
Only the people in last place got that chance.

118
00:04:47,059 --> 00:04:48,697
Don't say we came in last.

119
00:04:48,698 --> 00:04:49,929
We came in fifth place.

120
00:04:50,029 --> 00:04:52,169
Out of the 5 teams, the team in 5th place got the benefit.

121
00:04:52,438 --> 00:04:53,498
Aren't you envious?

122
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:55,909
- The chance to go on a date? - Yes.

123
00:04:57,008 --> 00:04:58,068
Yes.

124
00:04:58,909 --> 00:05:00,638
- I want to pick my date too. - You sound...

125
00:05:01,109 --> 00:05:03,378
- Do you know whom you'll pick? - Yes.

126
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:05,479
Too bad. You don't have that chance.

127
00:05:07,518 --> 00:05:09,789
Are you studying how to be annoying?

128
00:05:10,448 --> 00:05:13,918
I want to marinate the meat. The meat...

129
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,289
Does the meat want to meditate?

130
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:17,559
Yes. The meat is in the mood to meditate.

131
00:05:18,659 --> 00:05:20,929
- I should do it here. - Am I distracting you?

132
00:05:22,099 --> 00:05:24,068
Yes? Am I distracting you?

133
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:26,668
- Do you hold a grudge? - Me?

134
00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:27,669
Yes.

135
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,309
- For a long time? - I hold grudges for a long time.

136
00:05:30,138 --> 00:05:31,368
He keeps following her.

137
00:05:31,369 --> 00:05:32,478
- Right. - That's so funny.

138
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,708
I thought the two of them would go into the cupboard.

139
00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:36,279
Look. They went inside.

140
00:05:36,508 --> 00:05:38,919
If I were him, I would have gone inside for a bit.

141
00:05:39,049 --> 00:05:40,548
- If I were him. - What?

142
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:41,788
But there are shelves.

143
00:05:41,789 --> 00:05:42,989
I can be in pain briefly.

144
00:05:45,318 --> 00:05:46,789
(Am I distracting you?)

145
00:05:47,588 --> 00:05:48,728
(Do you hold a grudge?)

146
00:05:48,729 --> 00:05:49,729
(Me?)

147
00:05:50,229 --> 00:05:51,257
(For a long time.)

148
00:05:51,258 --> 00:05:52,559
(I hold grudges for a long time.)

149
00:05:52,859 --> 00:05:53,859
What's going on?

150
00:05:54,359 --> 00:05:55,468
What are you doing in that awful outfit?

151
00:05:55,469 --> 00:05:56,469
That doesn't suit you.

152
00:05:57,229 --> 00:05:58,869
- Shush. - Shush.

153
00:05:59,138 --> 00:06:00,169
- Shush. - Shush.

154
00:06:00,299 --> 00:06:02,669
When I grind black pepper like this, do I look like a good cook?

155
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:04,739
No.

156
00:06:05,409 --> 00:06:06,479
(Chuckling)

157
00:06:06,838 --> 00:06:07,909
You look like a good cook.

158
00:06:08,378 --> 00:06:10,508
Can I eat with you guys?

159
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:12,318
- Eat with us? - Yes.

160
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,479
Sure.

161
00:06:15,388 --> 00:06:17,388
Can I eat with you guys?

162
00:06:18,188 --> 00:06:19,388
- Eat with us? - Yes.

163
00:06:19,518 --> 00:06:20,559
Sure.

164
00:06:26,328 --> 00:06:27,359
Well done.

165
00:06:30,029 --> 00:06:31,029
(Glancing)

166
00:06:39,378 --> 00:06:41,309
(He takes out more meat from the fridge.)

167
00:06:42,248 --> 00:06:43,248
- Excuse me. - Okay.

168
00:06:47,619 --> 00:06:48,619
That's it.

169
00:06:49,188 --> 00:06:50,188
Did you do it?

170
00:06:51,549 --> 00:06:52,659
- Gosh. - Good.

171
00:06:53,989 --> 00:06:55,729
Yes? Pour it? How much?

172
00:06:57,758 --> 00:07:00,128
- Can we add one more piece? - Sure.

173
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:03,099
Actually, I wanted to eat some too.

174
00:07:03,229 --> 00:07:05,968
Yong Woo asked if he could have some of the food.

175
00:07:05,969 --> 00:07:07,239
I suddenly thought,

176
00:07:07,369 --> 00:07:08,609
"Should I have some before I go?"

177
00:07:08,969 --> 00:07:10,609
Then everyone came down.

178
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:12,279
So I grilled the steak.

179
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:14,877
When we were cooking, it felt like...

180
00:07:14,878 --> 00:07:16,747
she was trying to take care of me.

181
00:07:16,748 --> 00:07:18,109
She put the apron on me.

182
00:07:18,748 --> 00:07:20,179
You have to pull the upper straps a lot.

183
00:07:20,818 --> 00:07:21,818
(Hitting)

184
00:07:22,549 --> 00:07:23,588
Wait. This...

185
00:07:24,648 --> 00:07:25,719
He's knocked out.

186
00:07:26,159 --> 00:07:28,858
But people were watching us.

187
00:07:28,859 --> 00:07:30,588
I'm a shy person.

188
00:07:31,188 --> 00:07:32,628
So it made me blush.

189
00:07:35,128 --> 00:07:37,998
- Were you secretly resenting me? - I'm done. What?

190
00:07:38,229 --> 00:07:40,638
- You teased me a lot today. - Yesterday...

191
00:07:44,539 --> 00:07:46,378
Wait. I didn't wipe off your makeup, right?

192
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:53,119
I get the feeling that this is a lot of food.

193
00:07:56,088 --> 00:07:57,119
Let me taste it.

194
00:07:59,818 --> 00:08:01,817
Gosh. He's feeding her.

195
00:08:01,818 --> 00:08:04,328
- What? They're on a date. - He's feeding her.

196
00:08:05,258 --> 00:08:06,757
(Approving)

197
00:08:06,758 --> 00:08:08,328
- It's tasty. - It's tasty.

198
00:08:09,128 --> 00:08:10,368
- Gosh. But... - The colour looks amazing.

199
00:08:10,369 --> 00:08:12,068
- It's tasty. - I knew it.

200
00:08:12,369 --> 00:08:13,568
(Humming)

201
00:08:13,768 --> 00:08:14,768
I knew it.

202
00:08:14,768 --> 00:08:15,768

(Communicating with humming)

204
00:08:19,409 --> 00:08:21,477
I thought I was at your recital again.

205
00:08:21,478 --> 00:08:23,477
- It smells great. - Come and try some.

206
00:08:23,478 --> 00:08:24,749
Ju Yeon. It's hot. Try it.

207
00:08:25,078 --> 00:08:26,977
- Should I cut the sausages? - Yes.

208
00:08:26,978 --> 00:08:27,978
No.

209
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,988
- Nice. You make a mean pasta. - Can I have some?

210
00:08:35,529 --> 00:08:38,187
Well, I used the pasta sauce from the store.

211
00:08:38,188 --> 00:08:39,429
- Shush. - Shush.

212
00:08:40,499 --> 00:08:43,129
- Is it good? - It's so good.

213
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:46,738
(Slurping)

214
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:50,337
- It's tasty. - We can't eat a lot, though.

215
00:08:50,338 --> 00:08:51,338
I trying hard not to.

216
00:08:52,938 --> 00:08:54,207
Thank you for the food.

217
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:55,509
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

218
00:08:55,848 --> 00:08:57,608
- Go ahead and swim. - I'll swim.

219

(Glancing)

220
00:09:02,088 --> 00:09:04,347
- I see some belly fat. - Belly fat?

221
00:09:04,348 --> 00:09:05,718
Did you come down after doing some push-ups?

222
00:09:06,188 --> 00:09:07,357
I have a lot of belly fat now?

223
00:09:07,358 --> 00:09:08,789
You seem to have a lot of belly fat now.

224
00:09:09,088 --> 00:09:11,587
- I look slim? - I see a lot of belly fat.

225
00:09:11,588 --> 00:09:13,228
A lot of belly fat...

226
00:09:14,358 --> 00:09:16,029
Oh, no. What should I do?

227
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:18,498
(He takes his sister's advice and changes his outfit.)

228
00:09:18,499 --> 00:09:20,867
- You're wearing swimwear. - Why do you look shy coming down?

229
00:09:20,868 --> 00:09:22,639
- Why do you look so shy? - You look so shy.

230
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:26,408
(Surprised)

231
00:09:26,409 --> 00:09:27,409
Wait.

232
00:09:27,578 --> 00:09:28,608
(Taking it off)

233
00:09:31,009 --> 00:09:32,318
Can we watch him swim?

234
00:09:32,549 --> 00:09:33,578
I don't know.

235
00:09:35,889 --> 00:09:36,889
Are you having fun?

236
00:09:36,948 --> 00:09:38,818
Seriously. That kid is having so much fun.

237
00:09:39,858 --> 00:09:42,457
- Shall we go? Bye. See you later. - Bye.

238
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:44,029
- Bye. - See you.

(Cho A and Jae Hyung in 4th place begin their date.)

252
00:10:57,828 --> 00:10:58,838
Hi.

253
00:11:00,468 --> 00:11:01,738
You can go right now.

254
00:11:02,608 --> 00:11:04,968
- I hope it doesn't rain. - Right.

255
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,678
- It's my first date with you. - That's right.

256
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:10,149
This is a date with someone we haven't gone on a date.

257
00:11:10,578 --> 00:11:12,678
- Didn't you mostly go on a date... - Yes.

258
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:14,318
with Yong Woo?

259
00:11:14,578 --> 00:11:15,749
Yes. Right.

260
00:11:16,419 --> 00:11:18,987
Who else did you go on a date other than Yong Woo?

261
00:11:18,988 --> 00:11:20,019
Jung Sub.

262
00:11:20,588 --> 00:11:22,228
- I see. In Gangwon Province. - Yes.

263
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,588
Right. We went on a double date in Gangwon Province.

264
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:26,428
I thought talking to her would be nice.

265
00:11:26,429 --> 00:11:28,628
I thought she would be comfortable around me...

266
00:11:28,629 --> 00:11:30,528
and treat me nicely.

267
00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:32,468
So talking to her was comfortable.

268
00:11:33,169 --> 00:11:36,169
Actually, I wasn't sure about my feelings or what I wanted...

269
00:11:36,608 --> 00:11:38,107
- before then. - I see.

270
00:11:38,108 --> 00:11:40,577
Because of the environment and situation we were in,

271
00:11:40,578 --> 00:11:43,149
I felt like I had to choose someone for the sake of choosing.

272
00:11:43,809 --> 00:11:45,948
Because of that, I felt really uncomfortable.

273
00:11:46,218 --> 00:11:49,519
But after coming to Singapore, this kind of frustration I had...

274
00:11:49,749 --> 00:11:53,188
is getting relieved. That's how it feels so far.

275
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:57,488
I don't feel uncomfortable or feel the pressure...

276
00:11:57,828 --> 00:11:58,899
of making up my mind.

277
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:02,429
I can do that now naturally. It's a genuine act now.

278
00:12:03,129 --> 00:12:04,698
I now have someone...

279
00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:06,268
I want to send my text message to...

280
00:12:06,269 --> 00:12:08,098
even if we don't go on a date together.

281
00:12:09,139 --> 00:12:11,638
- Because of that, I feel at ease. - Really?

282
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:14,178
(It starts pouring down.)

283
00:12:14,179 --> 00:12:15,208
It's raining intensely.

284
00:12:16,249 --> 00:12:18,478
- What about you? - Yes?

285
00:12:18,848 --> 00:12:19,848
Are you certain about what you want?

286
00:12:20,649 --> 00:12:23,818
- After coming to Singapore, - Yes?

287
00:12:26,088 --> 00:12:28,188
things got hard emotionally.

288
00:12:28,358 --> 00:12:30,227
There was a moment that made me hesitate...

289
00:12:30,228 --> 00:12:32,088
for the first time. That happened in Singapore.

290
00:12:33,828 --> 00:12:36,327
To be completely honest, it's hard...

291
00:12:36,328 --> 00:12:40,538
to show yourself 100 percent while filming the show.

292
00:12:40,539 --> 00:12:42,467
- Right. - Our siblings are here too.

293
00:12:42,468 --> 00:12:44,238
- Right. - Despite that,

294
00:12:44,968 --> 00:12:46,837
I do believe that...

295
00:12:46,838 --> 00:12:50,549
she knows that I've made up my mind.

296
00:12:51,409 --> 00:12:53,149
That she knows how you feel?

297
00:12:53,848 --> 00:12:55,549
I became soaked little by little.

298
00:12:56,389 --> 00:12:57,418
You became soaked...

299
00:12:57,419 --> 00:12:58,519
- little by little. - Yes.

300
00:12:58,718 --> 00:13:00,988
- I didn't know when it drizzled. - Yes.

301
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,029
At one point, it feels like my entire body is soaked.

302
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:06,929
That might describe my feeling now.

303
00:13:12,499 --> 00:13:13,998
Now that we're here, it stopped raining.

- Can we get out of the car now? - Okay. Thank you.

307
00:13:22,978 --> 00:13:26,578
It feels liberating to talk about stuff like this with you.

308
00:13:26,649 --> 00:13:28,987
It's different from talking to your sibling.

309
00:13:28,988 --> 00:13:30,018
- It's different. - Yes.

310
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:33,318
Is this the food court they were talking about?

311
00:13:36,688 --> 00:13:38,587
What do you want to eat? I see skewers!

312
00:13:38,588 --> 00:13:40,128
I want chicken rice.

313
00:13:40,129 --> 00:13:42,828

Do you have the money...

315
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:46,698
- the staff gave you? - Yes.

316

The money.

321
00:13:55,879 --> 00:13:56,948

322
00:13:58,249 --> 00:13:59,279
Thank you.

00:14:00,478 --> 00:14:02,118

328

- Do you have chicken rice? - I think it will be tasty.

329

There are vegetables too. This looks good.

332

You're just like my cousin.

335

- Can I say her name? - Sure.

338

- Ji Won? - Yes.

339
00:14:46,198 --> 00:14:48,129
I asked her what her ideal type was.

340
00:14:48,858 --> 00:14:49,999
- You asked Ji Won? - Yes.

341
00:14:57,139 --> 00:14:58,309
Are you curious?

342
00:14:58,708 --> 00:14:59,738
Ji Won's ideal type?

343
00:15:00,139 --> 00:15:02,607
We talked about that when we were on a date yesterday.

344
00:15:02,608 --> 00:15:03,848
Each other's ideal type?

345
00:15:05,478 --> 00:15:07,118
What did she say to you?

346
00:15:07,249 --> 00:15:10,249
She said a cute guy who works hard at his job.

347
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:14,088
I'm pretty cute.

348
00:15:17,029 --> 00:15:18,029
You are.

349
00:15:18,588 --> 00:15:20,129
Jae Hyung is cute indeed.

350
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:23,828
What about you? What's your ideal type?

351
00:15:24,529 --> 00:15:28,868
Appearance-wise, I think I'm attracted to masculine guys.

352
00:15:29,438 --> 00:15:31,937
- Right. - But personality-wise,

353
00:15:31,938 --> 00:15:33,009
I'm attracted to sweet guys.

354
00:15:33,139 --> 00:15:34,179
(I see.)

355
00:15:35,078 --> 00:15:36,549
(He remembers someone.)

356
00:15:37,049 --> 00:15:40,848
I think he's a good match to your ideal type.

357
00:15:41,218 --> 00:15:42,748
- Who? - What?

358
00:15:42,749 --> 00:15:43,818
Who?

359
00:15:44,419 --> 00:15:46,118
- Is there someone like that here? - Should I not name him?

360
00:15:46,188 --> 00:15:47,357
- Don't name him. - Okay.

361
00:15:47,358 --> 00:15:49,289
- I'm shy. - Okay.

362
00:15:50,529 --> 00:15:52,658
I'm curious about how you express your affection.

363
00:15:52,659 --> 00:15:53,728
- Me? - Yes.

364
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:57,429
When I'm in a relationship, I'm not indifferent or anything.

365
00:15:57,698 --> 00:15:59,298
Actually, it's the contrary when I start dating.

366
00:15:59,299 --> 00:16:01,098
- I guess you change. - I'm really sweet.

367
00:16:02,509 --> 00:16:04,508
- He's so different. - Right.

368
00:16:04,509 --> 00:16:07,107
- I think that's the right thing. - Once he's certain.

369
00:16:07,108 --> 00:16:09,008
Well, I shouldn't say a behaviour is right or wrong.

370
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:11,207
But their behaviour can't be the same around everyone.

371
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:13,418
Shouldn't they behave differently around their significant others?

372
00:16:13,419 --> 00:16:14,648
- Right. - They should. Of course.

373
00:16:14,649 --> 00:16:16,187
Jae Hyung's behaviour is visibly different.

374
00:16:16,188 --> 00:16:17,487
We didn't see him go on dates with someone he liked.

375
00:16:17,488 --> 00:16:19,188
But when we saw him go on a date with a girl he liked,

376
00:16:19,659 --> 00:16:21,419
he suddenly became so attractive.

377
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,529
You became his fan last week.

378
00:16:23,789 --> 00:16:24,828
Right.

379
00:16:24,988 --> 00:16:26,528
- I'm the president of his fan club. - Did you forget that?

380
00:16:26,529 --> 00:16:28,129
Right. I forgot about that.

381
00:16:28,858 --> 00:16:31,029
I'm kind of shy before I start dating.

382
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,298
I think I'm shy because people might see how I feel.

383
00:16:34,299 --> 00:16:35,909
- That might be one reason. - I see.

384
00:16:36,568 --> 00:16:38,538
You're the type to act with certainty...

385
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:39,938
once you make up your mind.

386
00:16:41,238 --> 00:16:42,279
I think so.

387
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:44,379
- Shall we go? - Let's go.

388
00:16:47,779 --> 00:16:48,779
Your shoes look cute.

389
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:49,948
- Right? - Yes.

390
00:16:50,348 --> 00:16:51,618
They're the perfect shoes for today's date.

391
00:16:51,889 --> 00:16:54,018
Gosh. Here comes the rich couple.

392
00:16:54,019 --> 00:16:56,888
They have 1,000 dollars. What will they do with that money in a day?

393
00:16:57,428 --> 00:16:59,229
(The benefit of winning 1st place in the chicken fight)

394
00:17:01,459 --> 00:17:03,168
(They have a luxury limousine service.)

395
00:17:03,568 --> 00:17:05,398
(A professional chauffeur)

396
00:17:06,168 --> 00:17:07,799
The car is here.

397
00:17:12,739 --> 00:17:14,239
- Even their car is different. - Their car is different.

398
00:17:14,809 --> 00:17:16,008
They have a chauffeur too?

399
00:17:16,009 --> 00:17:17,048
- Gosh. Cheol Hyeon... - That's...

400
00:17:17,049 --> 00:17:18,148
will lean toward her even more now.

401
00:17:18,408 --> 00:17:20,218
- He'll see her as wife material. - Seriously.

402
00:17:20,219 --> 00:17:21,647
What a lucky guy to enjoy all this.

403
00:17:21,648 --> 00:17:22,719
- Seriously. - Exactly.

404
00:17:25,719 --> 00:17:26,858
Thank you.

405
00:17:28,158 --> 00:17:29,189
Thank you.

406
00:17:29,689 --> 00:17:30,828
What a great service!

407
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:34,327
- Cheol Hyeon. - This is the best.

408
00:17:34,328 --> 00:17:35,799
I told you to believe in me.

409
00:17:36,668 --> 00:17:37,928
Let's have fun today.

410
00:17:38,529 --> 00:17:39,969
I get to have this luxury thanks to you.

411
00:17:40,469 --> 00:17:43,567
- Se Seung, it's great to be out. - Right?

412
00:17:43,568 --> 00:17:45,469
We're in a great car on a rainy day.

413
00:17:45,709 --> 00:17:47,678
- Was he locked up somewhere? - This is his first time going out.

414
00:17:49,009 --> 00:17:50,548
He only stayed at the accommodation.

415
00:17:50,549 --> 00:17:51,607
Really?

416
00:17:51,608 --> 00:17:53,917
This is his first date. So it all worked out for him.

417
00:17:53,918 --> 00:17:56,218
He wore a white outfit and stayed inside like a Buddhist monk.

418
00:17:56,219 --> 00:17:57,249
He only stayed indoors.

419
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:00,318
Let me comb my bangs.

420
00:18:01,318 --> 00:18:03,689
Look at my bangs today.

421
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:05,628
See you after the date.

422
00:18:05,789 --> 00:18:06,799
Bye.

423
00:18:07,029 --> 00:18:08,029
You'll have fun.

424
00:18:10,199 --> 00:18:12,269
- You're still here. - Yes.

425
00:18:12,769 --> 00:18:15,199
(Ju Yeon and Yun Jae are in the living room.)

426
00:18:17,068 --> 00:18:18,469
Should I wear this pair of shoes?

427
00:18:20,338 --> 00:18:23,509
Or should I wear sneakers?

428
00:18:25,378 --> 00:18:26,417
- They look cute. - Wear these instead.

429
00:18:26,418 --> 00:18:27,418
It's raining today.

430
00:18:27,419 --> 00:18:28,618
If you wear sneakers, they'll get soaked.

431
00:18:28,719 --> 00:18:30,088
- Will they be better then? - Yes.

432
00:18:30,588 --> 00:18:33,058
- They match your bag nicely too. - Yes, they match better.

433
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:35,018
Don't wear sneakers. It's raining.

434
00:18:35,019 --> 00:18:36,157
- Right. It's raining. - Yes.

435
00:18:36,158 --> 00:18:37,958
Look at Yun Jae right now.

436
00:18:37,959 --> 00:18:40,327
Check out his facial expression as Yun Ha gets ready to go out.

437
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:42,598
- Look at him. - He's bothered by her date.

438
00:18:43,269 --> 00:18:45,327
He looks so unhappy right now.

439
00:18:45,328 --> 00:18:46,968
But he's still worried that her sneakers might get wet.

440
00:18:46,969 --> 00:18:49,239
- He told her to wear sandals. - Right.

441
00:18:50,509 --> 00:18:52,308
(Will they be better then?)

442
00:18:52,309 --> 00:18:55,238
(- They match your bag nicely too. - Yes, they match better.)

443
00:18:55,239 --> 00:18:57,378
(Don't wear sneakers. It's raining.)

444
00:18:58,249 --> 00:19:00,779
(Yong Woo comes down too.)

445
00:19:02,118 --> 00:19:03,488
Okay. See you later.

446
00:19:03,489 --> 00:19:05,347
See you later.

447
00:19:05,348 --> 00:19:06,958
See you later. Have a good time.

448
00:19:06,959 --> 00:19:08,988
Enjoy your date.

449
00:19:08,989 --> 00:19:11,529
(Were you bothered that Yun Ha and Yong Woo went on a date?)

450
00:19:11,729 --> 00:19:14,499
Oh, that date... Yong Woo and Yun Ha...

451
00:19:14,628 --> 00:19:18,098
I wasn't bothered because she went on a date with Yong Woo.

452
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:20,098
I wasn't bothered because it was Yong Woo.

453
00:19:20,638 --> 00:19:22,939
I wouldn't have felt good whoever her date turned out to be.

454
00:19:23,338 --> 00:19:24,938
To be honest, I don't know...

455
00:19:24,939 --> 00:19:27,039
to whom she'll feel attracted. So that's why...

456
00:19:27,378 --> 00:19:28,408
I hated everything about it.

457
00:19:33,749 --> 00:19:35,318
- Should I get in first? - Sure

458
00:19:35,848 --> 00:19:36,848
Hello.

459
00:19:37,118 --> 00:19:38,718
(Yun Ha and Yong Woo in 2nd place set out.)

460
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,118
Today,

461
00:19:40,658 --> 00:19:41,817
we somehow ended up...

462
00:19:41,818 --> 00:19:43,157
- winning second place. - Yes.

463
00:19:43,158 --> 00:19:46,158
Don't you think we got a spacious car?

464
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:47,259
Don't you agree?

465
00:19:47,459 --> 00:19:49,528
- There's a lot of space here. - Seriously.

466
00:19:49,529 --> 00:19:52,167
So you're responsible for making our date great.

467
00:19:52,168 --> 00:19:53,168
I worked hard.

468
00:19:53,169 --> 00:19:55,469
- You made our date great. - I worked hard.

469
00:19:56,408 --> 00:19:58,738
So we got to go on a date in the end.

470
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,779
- We ended up with a date abroad. - Yes.

471
00:20:01,479 --> 00:20:04,147
When we first started, I chose Yong Woo...

472
00:20:04,148 --> 00:20:06,449
as the guy I was interested in.

473
00:20:06,479 --> 00:20:09,718
(Yun Ha sent her Cupid Message to Yong Woo on Day One.)

474
00:20:09,719 --> 00:20:10,719
(Thanks to you, everyone got along well today.)

475
00:20:10,719 --> 00:20:11,719
(Let's have fun getting to know each other.)

476
00:20:11,888 --> 00:20:13,788
- Nice to meet you. - I felt that...

477
00:20:13,789 --> 00:20:15,158
he had a kind face.

478
00:20:15,588 --> 00:20:18,189
I like funny guys.

479
00:20:18,358 --> 00:20:20,858
So I became slightly interested in him.

480
00:20:22,398 --> 00:20:24,199
I liked Yong Woo.

481
00:20:24,529 --> 00:20:28,539
He has a very likeable face.

482
00:20:30,338 --> 00:20:32,137
I sent the message to Yong Woo.

483
00:20:32,138 --> 00:20:33,178
(She also sent her first text message to Yong Woo.)

484
00:20:34,178 --> 00:20:39,077
(I had so much fun thanks to you. Let's keep having fun.)

485
00:20:39,078 --> 00:20:43,417
After a lot of time had passed and many things happened,

486
00:20:43,418 --> 00:20:46,117
I finally had a chance...

487
00:20:46,118 --> 00:20:47,888
to go on a date with him.

488
00:20:48,158 --> 00:20:49,628
Wait. Can this date potentially cause changes?

489
00:20:50,128 --> 00:20:51,128
A bit?

490
00:20:51,858 --> 00:20:53,229
Gosh, no way.

491
00:20:53,799 --> 00:20:55,597
After this date,

492
00:20:55,598 --> 00:20:57,327
Yun Ha might start having...

493
00:20:57,328 --> 00:20:58,628
- It might confuse her. - something... Right.

494
00:20:58,969 --> 00:21:00,739
- She might develop some feelings. - That's not entirely impossible.

495
00:21:01,638 --> 00:21:03,167
Things can change...

496
00:21:03,168 --> 00:21:04,667
- Right. - in a day.

497
00:21:04,668 --> 00:21:07,778
Anyway, Yong Woo was Yun Ha's type, appearance-wise.

498
00:21:07,779 --> 00:21:08,779
- Right. - Yes.

499
00:21:09,378 --> 00:21:11,877
I have a funny episode about us.

500
00:21:11,878 --> 00:21:13,019
In the beginning,

501
00:21:13,378 --> 00:21:16,489
we had to answer the phone to pick our date.

502
00:21:16,689 --> 00:21:18,019
I thought my date was you.

503
00:21:18,189 --> 00:21:19,218
- Really? - Yes.

504
00:21:19,219 --> 00:21:21,519
The lady who answered the phone sounded so bubbly.

505
00:21:21,858 --> 00:21:24,058
I was kind of lost. On top of that, I'm not sharp with things like this.

506
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:25,927
- I sort of noticed that. - Right.

507
00:21:25,928 --> 00:21:28,458
- You're kind of slow. - I realized that too.

508
00:21:28,459 --> 00:21:29,798
- That's your charm. - Is that so?

509
00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:31,469
- Yes. - That's a relief.

510
00:21:32,229 --> 00:21:34,097
So who was the lady you went on a date with?

511
00:21:34,098 --> 00:21:36,709
- It was Cho A. - I see. Cho A was bubbly?

512
00:21:37,068 --> 00:21:38,668
She's more expressive on 1-on-1 dates.

513
00:21:40,779 --> 00:21:41,908
This show is fun.

514
00:21:43,049 --> 00:21:45,148
I'm finding a lot about myself here.

515
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:46,549
It's the same with me.

516
00:21:47,578 --> 00:21:50,718
I don't think things were awkward between us...

517
00:21:50,719 --> 00:21:51,848
from the get-go.

518
00:21:52,219 --> 00:21:53,559
It wasn't awkward at all.

519
00:21:53,888 --> 00:21:56,628
So I found myself talking a lot more naturally to her.

520
00:21:56,888 --> 00:21:58,289
We teased each other a lot too.

521
00:21:58,588 --> 00:22:00,558
She was so cheerful and made me feel comfortable.

522
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,358
So I ended up talking a lot.

523
00:22:02,928 --> 00:22:05,228
On that note, what's your ideal type?

524
00:22:05,229 --> 00:22:07,439
What kind of type are you attracted to appearance-wise?

525
00:22:07,898 --> 00:22:09,769
Han Go Eun is my ideal type, appearance-wise.

526
00:22:12,168 --> 00:22:15,509
How would you describe your ideal type in detail?

527
00:22:16,348 --> 00:22:18,378
- He must have a beautiful nose. - The nose.

528
00:22:18,949 --> 00:22:21,518
Is it because your family has a beautiful nose?

529
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:23,318
Am I attracted to someone similar to me?

530
00:22:23,449 --> 00:22:25,418
- That's possible. - I think so.

531
00:22:26,459 --> 00:22:28,019
You need to have some things in common.

532
00:22:28,289 --> 00:22:30,188
In the past, I started relationships...

533
00:22:30,189 --> 00:22:32,387
thinking I could accommodate her...

534
00:22:32,388 --> 00:22:34,158
even if we didn't have anything in common.

535
00:22:35,299 --> 00:22:36,328
But it wasn't easy.

536
00:22:37,598 --> 00:22:38,698
That's really nice of you.

537
00:22:38,699 --> 00:22:41,439
The fact that you dated someone with that mindset.

538
00:22:42,239 --> 00:22:44,337
Do you know what's really interesting with them?

539
00:22:44,338 --> 00:22:46,377
No other couples can have conversations like them.

540
00:22:46,378 --> 00:22:48,038
- Right. - They're talking so politely.

541
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:50,009
- They're using honorifics. - Yes.

542
00:22:50,378 --> 00:22:52,577
Using honorifics means...

543
00:22:52,578 --> 00:22:54,048
they aren't so close.

544
00:22:54,049 --> 00:22:56,647
- It can make their hearts flutter. - Yes. Because they're not close...

545
00:22:56,648 --> 00:22:58,817
- There's definitely that chemistry. - They have no history right now.

546
00:22:58,818 --> 00:22:59,818
It's a blank slate.

547
00:22:59,819 --> 00:23:00,887
- Right. - Their relationship...

548
00:23:00,888 --> 00:23:02,719
- That's when anything can happen. - Right.

549
00:23:04,029 --> 00:23:05,088
This is interesting.

550
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:06,858
I think we're almost there.

551
00:23:07,398 --> 00:23:09,098
- There are so many people here. - Right.

552
00:23:09,828 --> 00:23:12,199
(An oasis in the heart of Singapore downtown)

553
00:23:13,469 --> 00:23:17,568
(Gardens by the Bay)

554
00:23:28,219 --> 00:23:29,588
Have you been to a botanical garden like this?

555
00:23:30,088 --> 00:23:32,648
I think I've gone to a botanical garden in Korea.

556
00:23:33,658 --> 00:23:34,888
I don't think...

557
00:23:34,989 --> 00:23:37,188
I've been to a botanical garden that resembles...

558
00:23:37,189 --> 00:23:38,729
- a pretty amusement park. - Right.

559
00:23:39,628 --> 00:23:41,799
- Shall we go down this way? - Sure. Shall we?

560
00:23:42,499 --> 00:23:44,567
By the way, why are you speaking with honorifics?

561
00:23:44,568 --> 00:23:46,198
- Me? - Yes. Are you uncomfortable?

562
00:23:46,199 --> 00:23:47,667
No. Speaking with honorifics is more comfortable.

563
00:23:47,668 --> 00:23:48,798
- Is that so? - Yes.

564
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:50,769
- I'm comfortable with being casual. - I...

565
00:23:50,908 --> 00:23:52,709
- Let's talk casually then. - Yes.

566
00:23:53,709 --> 00:23:55,338
Is this our 1st time talking 1-on-1 like this?

567
00:23:55,878 --> 00:23:57,779
It's our first time talking casually like this.

568
00:23:58,309 --> 00:23:59,309
Really?

569
00:24:00,449 --> 00:24:02,377
(Cloud Forest)

570
00:24:02,378 --> 00:24:04,019
Our outfits were perfect for this.

571
00:24:04,549 --> 00:24:05,948
Because it's so colourful,

572
00:24:05,949 --> 00:24:06,958
- white outfits will look good here. - Right.

573
00:24:06,959 --> 00:24:08,818
Should we try it here too? Will it open up?

574
00:24:14,098 --> 00:24:16,529
- What's this? It's so fascinating. - It's so beautiful.

575
00:24:18,098 --> 00:24:19,868
I didn't know there was a huge structure like this here.

576
00:24:20,068 --> 00:24:21,439
This is so beautiful.

577
00:24:22,338 --> 00:24:24,408
- By the way, this is so cool. - Right.

578
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,209
Why don't we put our heads together?

579
00:24:27,479 --> 00:24:28,778
Put our heads together? Like this?

580
00:24:28,779 --> 00:24:29,779
Put the tip of your hair on mine.

581
00:24:31,408 --> 00:24:32,578
On your hair like this?

582
00:24:33,678 --> 00:24:35,549
(Successfully putting their hair together)

583
00:24:36,078 --> 00:24:38,348
To be honest, I didn't know it would be this big.

584
00:24:39,858 --> 00:24:41,289
- This place is beautiful. - Right.

585
00:24:42,019 --> 00:24:44,858
I guess we can go up through that.

586
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:47,499
- Look at the background here. - This is scary.

587
00:24:47,628 --> 00:24:48,728
Here?

588
00:24:48,729 --> 00:24:52,469
- Are you afraid of heights? - Yes, a bit.

589
00:24:52,769 --> 00:24:54,097
This is so beautiful.

590
00:24:54,098 --> 00:24:55,498
The sun is going down over there.

591
00:24:55,499 --> 00:24:57,138
- Gosh. How stunning. - This is beautiful.

592
00:24:59,739 --> 00:25:02,108
I don't want to admit it. But maybe, I'm getting old.

593
00:25:02,578 --> 00:25:03,908
I like plants nowadays.

594
00:25:04,608 --> 00:25:07,479
(He takes a lot of pictures with the plants he likes.)

595
00:25:12,289 --> 00:25:13,688
It's like we're taking pictures in a jungle.

596
00:25:13,689 --> 00:25:14,989
(Taking a photo with the plant through the mirror)

597
00:25:15,118 --> 00:25:17,087
(Cloud Theater)

598
00:25:17,088 --> 00:25:18,358
This is so beautiful.

599
00:25:19,588 --> 00:25:20,759
How about a video of you doing a kick?

600
00:25:24,729 --> 00:25:25,928
This is the camerawork for a movie.

601
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:32,539
Is that the bird we're seeing?

602
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:36,779
In a way, it felt like my last date.

603
00:25:36,878 --> 00:25:38,248
- So I tried to take... - Try to tap on it.

604
00:25:38,249 --> 00:25:40,279
as many fun pictures as possible.

605
00:25:40,479 --> 00:25:43,519
He took so many amazing photos of me.

606
00:25:43,719 --> 00:25:45,087
When we went to Gangneung,

607
00:25:45,088 --> 00:25:47,019
Ju Yeon took such great photos which surprised me.

608
00:25:47,318 --> 00:25:48,559
I guess that skill runs in the family.

609
00:25:49,658 --> 00:25:50,788
- I got you the best photo. - Thank you.

610
00:25:50,789 --> 00:25:52,627
I never look good in Polaroid pictures,

611
00:25:52,628 --> 00:25:53,658
so I always hated that.

612
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:55,658
I'm kind of proud of this one.

613
00:25:57,269 --> 00:25:59,469
(The team in last place leaves the house.)

614
00:26:00,638 --> 00:26:02,938
By the way, we picked good matching outfits.

615
00:26:02,939 --> 00:26:06,479
- Totally. We look like a set. - The belt, sandals, and the bag.

616
00:26:06,809 --> 00:26:07,979
Seriously.

617
00:26:08,678 --> 00:26:10,049
(Disappointed)

618
00:26:10,378 --> 00:26:12,508
- Ji Won, look at this. - Someone just threw it there.

619
00:26:12,509 --> 00:26:15,618
(Only one bill is left in the taxi.)

620
00:26:16,219 --> 00:26:19,218
Fifty... Do you know the old show? "Happiness With Ten Dollars?"

621
00:26:19,219 --> 00:26:21,818
I know the show. It feels like we're filming that show.

622
00:26:22,358 --> 00:26:25,058
We got into the taxi. On the backseat,

623
00:26:25,059 --> 00:26:27,298
we saw a bill. It was as if someone had just thrown it.

624
00:26:27,299 --> 00:26:28,357
(Chuckling)

625
00:26:28,358 --> 00:26:31,427
The bill was on the backseat.

626
00:26:31,428 --> 00:26:33,098
I saw the 50-dollar bill.

627
00:26:33,368 --> 00:26:36,407
I thought to myself that we had to be very frugal today.

628
00:26:36,408 --> 00:26:38,469
The 50-dollar date is kind of romantic.

629
00:26:38,868 --> 00:26:40,209
I decided to enjoy...

630
00:26:40,539 --> 00:26:42,809
this romantic date to the fullest.

631
00:26:43,509 --> 00:26:46,108
They really gave us only 50 dollars.

632
00:26:46,848 --> 00:26:48,948
I see a lot of restaurants...

633
00:26:48,949 --> 00:26:50,518
with tasty food at the West Coast Park.

634
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:52,188
- But I guess... - Yes.

635
00:26:52,189 --> 00:26:54,588
we can't afford those places with 50 dollars.

636
00:26:55,259 --> 00:26:56,357
We'll spend some time there.

637
00:26:56,358 --> 00:26:57,658
- Then we'll go to a food court. - So...

638
00:26:57,858 --> 00:26:59,458
- We'll look at some food. - We'll keep saying,

639
00:26:59,459 --> 00:27:00,798
"That looks good."

640
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:03,199
We'll just drool at the food.

641
00:27:04,229 --> 00:27:05,699
We'll have to ride it in the rain.

642
00:27:05,868 --> 00:27:07,637
- Are you okay with that? - I'm fine.

643
00:27:07,638 --> 00:27:08,698
- Really? - Yes.

644
00:27:08,699 --> 00:27:09,868
(Raising his arm)

645
00:27:10,809 --> 00:27:11,867
(Pretending to ride the bicycle in the rain)

646
00:27:11,868 --> 00:27:12,969
With one arm?

647
00:27:15,739 --> 00:27:17,209
I wonder how it looks there.

648
00:27:17,479 --> 00:27:18,678
Is it by the beach?

649
00:27:19,648 --> 00:27:22,078
- It must be by the beach. - Ride the bicycle by the beach.

650
00:27:22,848 --> 00:27:24,618
Yes. It's quite romantic.

651
00:27:26,088 --> 00:27:28,558
Let's have fun and take a shower when we go back.

652
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,029
- Sounds good. - Good.

653
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:33,828
(Ji Won and Jung Sub, West Coast Park)

654
00:27:34,959 --> 00:27:36,628
I guess we'll be riding that.

655
00:27:37,699 --> 00:27:38,728
(There's a roof over the bicycles.)

656
00:27:38,729 --> 00:27:41,438
That must be why we can still ride it in the rain.

657
00:27:41,439 --> 00:27:43,708
(Surprised)

658
00:27:43,709 --> 00:27:45,137
- This is nice. - It's cool.

659
00:27:45,138 --> 00:27:46,479
It's so cute.

660
00:27:47,309 --> 00:27:49,408
- Hello. - Hello. Hi.

661
00:27:50,378 --> 00:27:52,478
To rent the bikes, it'll be 15 Singapore dollars.

662
00:27:52,479 --> 00:27:54,049
- Fifteen Singapore dollars? - Yes.

663
00:27:54,249 --> 00:27:56,748
- I see. Okay. - Okay.

664
00:27:56,749 --> 00:27:59,189
- Should we spend our money now? - The money?

665
00:28:00,019 --> 00:28:01,059
This is our precious money.

666
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:03,018
- First of all, he said it was... - We have to spend...

667
00:28:03,019 --> 00:28:05,428
- fifteen Singapore dollars. - fifteen Singapore dollars.

668
00:28:05,689 --> 00:28:07,827
- Okay. - What's our balance? Ta-da.

669
00:28:07,828 --> 00:28:08,927
- Ta-da. - It's 35.

670
00:28:08,928 --> 00:28:11,228
(Total balance: 35 Singapore dollars)

671
00:28:11,229 --> 00:28:13,138
- Okay. Thank you. - Thank you.

672
00:28:13,299 --> 00:28:14,539
- Gosh, that's... - Seriously.

673
00:28:14,699 --> 00:28:17,138
- They spent a lot of money. - Right.

674
00:28:17,509 --> 00:28:18,808
They'll run out of the money once they rent it three times.

675
00:28:18,809 --> 00:28:19,939
Right.

676
00:28:20,408 --> 00:28:22,177
This is so cute. I've never ridden a bicycle like this.

677
00:28:22,178 --> 00:28:24,378
- Right. - What's this?

678
00:28:25,049 --> 00:28:27,478
(They can't stop laughing.)

679
00:28:27,479 --> 00:28:28,678
This is really fun.

680
00:28:28,719 --> 00:28:30,019
- Go? - Go.

681
00:28:30,449 --> 00:28:32,848
- Here we go. - Wait. No?

682
00:28:33,618 --> 00:28:34,689
Slowly.

683
00:28:35,118 --> 00:28:37,259
(Exclaiming)

684
00:28:37,858 --> 00:28:40,499
(They smoothly curve the bicycles.)

685
00:28:40,828 --> 00:28:43,269
(This is funny for some reason.)

686
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:46,299
- This is so funny. - What is this?

687
00:28:47,368 --> 00:28:49,039
- Hey, Jung Sub. - What is this?

688
00:28:49,398 --> 00:28:51,039
I see an uphill path.

689
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:54,608
Let's not look so silly, though.

690
00:28:54,739 --> 00:28:56,038
- Okay. - Okay?

691
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:59,549
- Let's make it look romantic. - Romantic? Okay. For the that vibe.

692
00:29:00,249 --> 00:29:01,279
It's right here.

693
00:29:01,918 --> 00:29:03,388
Pedal hard.

694
00:29:04,719 --> 00:29:06,048
Clench your molars.

695
00:29:06,049 --> 00:29:07,519
(Clenching)

696
00:29:08,618 --> 00:29:10,088
It's like riding a rickshaw.

697
00:29:11,029 --> 00:29:13,088
- This is so fun. - Yes, it's fun.

698
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:15,029
The vlog on the road.

699
00:29:15,529 --> 00:29:18,528
(Filmed by Jung Sub)

700
00:29:18,529 --> 00:29:19,568
(Running)

701
00:29:20,138 --> 00:29:21,198
(Impressed)

702
00:29:21,199 --> 00:29:22,338
She's going faster than us.

703
00:29:22,539 --> 00:29:26,068
- Running is faster than this. - Right. It's much faster.

704
00:29:26,678 --> 00:29:28,877
- Is this similar to a pedal boat? - Totally.

705
00:29:28,878 --> 00:29:29,878
(Slow)

706
00:29:29,879 --> 00:29:31,147
It's fascinating...

707
00:29:31,148 --> 00:29:32,578
- that there are bicycles like this. - Should we pedal fast?

708
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:34,749
- Super fast? - Super fast.

709
00:29:35,049 --> 00:29:36,077
Okay.

710
00:29:36,078 --> 00:29:37,388
(Pedalling super-fast)

711
00:29:39,489 --> 00:29:42,018
I can't keep up with your pedalling speed.

712
00:29:42,019 --> 00:29:44,387
(Pedalling furiously)

713
00:29:44,388 --> 00:29:45,489
This is crazy.

714
00:29:45,989 --> 00:29:47,299
I can't see her.

715
00:29:48,128 --> 00:29:49,897
(Amazed)

716
00:29:49,898 --> 00:29:51,168
- It's cool and breezy. - It's cool and breezy.

717
00:29:52,469 --> 00:29:53,498
You're pedalling way too fast,

718
00:29:53,499 --> 00:29:54,499
so my pedals are spinning on their own.

719
00:29:54,739 --> 00:29:55,897
They're spinning on their own.

720
00:29:55,898 --> 00:29:58,068
(The runner already turned at the halfway point.)

721
00:29:59,709 --> 00:30:02,809
- Seriously. This is so funny. - Goodness. Why is it so funny?

722
00:30:03,178 --> 00:30:04,549
Hey, Jung Sub.

723
00:30:05,648 --> 00:30:07,719
I can barely see your feet right now.

724
00:30:09,178 --> 00:30:10,588
I can't see your legs.

725
00:30:13,318 --> 00:30:15,158
We were riding the bicycles at the park.

726
00:30:15,189 --> 00:30:17,559
We were laughing a lot.

727
00:30:18,088 --> 00:30:21,628
We pedalled really fast. We tried to pedal as hard we could.

728
00:30:21,699 --> 00:30:23,269
We were like swans.

729
00:30:24,469 --> 00:30:26,799
We pedalled hard with our feet just like the swan.

730
00:30:26,999 --> 00:30:29,137
We had to pedal a lot to ride the bicycle.

731
00:30:29,138 --> 00:30:30,439
But it was really fun.

732
00:30:30,668 --> 00:30:32,469
It wasn't romantic or anything.

733
00:30:32,838 --> 00:30:34,838
We were like comrades. We pedalled powerfully...

734
00:30:34,939 --> 00:30:37,479
when we rode the bicycles together.

735
00:30:39,779 --> 00:30:41,778
Ji Won. Aren't you comfortable now?

736
00:30:41,779 --> 00:30:43,118
It's really comfortable for me.

737
00:30:44,318 --> 00:30:45,989
You're pedalling for both of us.

738
00:30:46,549 --> 00:30:47,658
It's like you're competing...

739
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:49,588
- in the Summer Games. - The Summer Games.

740
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,989
You look like a cyclist participating in the Summer Games.

741
00:30:54,098 --> 00:30:55,229
An energetic cyclist.

742
00:30:55,328 --> 00:30:57,868
I want to have some coffee. But we don't have any money, right?

743
00:30:59,029 --> 00:31:00,299
I'm glad we brought water.

744
00:31:00,699 --> 00:31:02,168
Since we don't have money, let's drink water.

745
00:31:03,709 --> 00:31:04,809
Can't we stop...

746
00:31:05,009 --> 00:31:07,309
for a moment and look at the sights or something?

747
00:31:08,378 --> 00:31:11,408
- Ji Won. Check out the view. - Sure.

748
00:31:11,878 --> 00:31:13,918
- We're not in a race or anything. - Right.

749
00:31:15,178 --> 00:31:16,178
(Surprised)

750
00:31:16,719 --> 00:31:18,718
- What happened? - Oh, no.

751
00:31:18,719 --> 00:31:21,019
- Why did it splash only on you? - Only me...

752
00:31:21,888 --> 00:31:23,458
- I'm okay. - Are you okay?

753
00:31:23,459 --> 00:31:24,459
- I went there on purpose. - Jung Sub.

754
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,828
How come your pants are clean?

755
00:31:27,358 --> 00:31:28,427
- You... Hold on. - Wait. Seriously.

756
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:29,927
How come my pants are so clean?

757
00:31:29,928 --> 00:31:30,928
What's going on?

758
00:31:30,929 --> 00:31:33,098
- You're the one driving this. - This...

759
00:31:33,539 --> 00:31:35,539
- Hold on. - The muddy water splashed on me.

760
00:31:35,868 --> 00:31:36,939
I'm sorry.

761
00:31:37,709 --> 00:31:39,108
- Gosh. - Do you want to drive this?

762
00:31:39,138 --> 00:31:40,978
So it's fine as long as your pants are clean?

763
00:31:40,979 --> 00:31:42,877
So you're going to start driving it now.

764
00:31:42,878 --> 00:31:44,577
What if the muddy water starts splashing the other side?

765
00:31:44,578 --> 00:31:46,378
- I'd rather have mud on both sides. - What if...

766
00:31:47,618 --> 00:31:49,019
(Surprised)

767
00:31:49,318 --> 00:31:50,949
- This is fun. - I'm the best driver.

768
00:31:52,219 --> 00:31:54,259
I think we already arrived.

769
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:55,858
Did we already arrive?

770
00:31:56,658 --> 00:31:59,588
- We already arrived. - It's shorter than I thought.

771
00:32:02,358 --> 00:32:04,098
Gosh. It was really fun.

772
00:32:05,499 --> 00:32:06,567
Let me see your pants.

773
00:32:06,568 --> 00:32:08,038
- They're already dirty. - Seriously. What is this?

774
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:09,098
(Jung Sub checks Ji Won's pants.)

775
00:32:09,499 --> 00:32:11,608
- I'll go to the restroom. - Okay. Go ahead.

776
00:32:11,769 --> 00:32:13,509
- I'll see if I can wipe it off. - Okay.

777
00:32:13,838 --> 00:32:15,039
Are you okay, Ji Won?

778
00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:17,107
- Me? - Are you okay, Ji Won?

779
00:32:17,108 --> 00:32:18,178
(Chuckling)

780
00:32:18,678 --> 00:32:20,318
- I'm not okay. - Really?

781
00:32:20,878 --> 00:32:23,549
Do you need something to cover up? I brought a shirt.

782
00:32:23,648 --> 00:32:25,647
There's nothing I can do with the bottom part of my pants.

783
00:32:25,648 --> 00:32:27,489
- It's the back side of the pants. - Let me see.

784
00:32:27,658 --> 00:32:29,658
It's fine as long as they don't mistake it for something else.

785
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:34,098
- I don't make that kind of mistake. - If people start whispering...

786
00:32:34,828 --> 00:32:37,029
- Tell them that's not it. - "Look at her."

787
00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:39,667
Or do you want to tie something around your waist?

788
00:32:39,668 --> 00:32:41,039
- What kind of shirt is it? - I...

789
00:32:42,469 --> 00:32:44,939
- I don't care if stuff gets on it. - But...

790
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:47,077
- Let me go and check it out. - Okay. Go ahead.

791
00:32:47,078 --> 00:32:50,278
- But with this around my waist, - If it's hot... Are you hot?

792
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:53,479
it makes me look like I have more stuff on my bottom.

793
00:32:55,648 --> 00:32:57,917
- I think it's better this way. Yes. - Like you're doing it for real.

794
00:32:57,918 --> 00:33:00,459
It looks like I'm trying to cover up something really big.

795
00:33:00,818 --> 00:33:03,627
Some muddy water got only on Ji Won's pants.

796
00:33:03,628 --> 00:33:05,857
I wanted to cover it up, so I gave her my shirt.

797
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:08,228
But when she tried to cover it up with my shirt,

798
00:33:08,229 --> 00:33:11,428
it made her look like she really soiled her pants.

799
00:33:11,628 --> 00:33:14,699
So I couldn't help her. I felt bad about that.

800
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:17,567
I saw how worried Jung Sub got about me.

801
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:21,877
He was always sweet to Yun Ha.

802
00:33:21,878 --> 00:33:23,808
So I was fascinated and envious of her.

803
00:33:23,809 --> 00:33:25,177
That occasion made me realize...

804
00:33:25,178 --> 00:33:27,148
that he was a lot kinder and more thoughtful...

805
00:33:27,318 --> 00:33:29,178
than I initially thought.

806
00:33:30,318 --> 00:33:32,218
- So... Let me see. - We can just go. I'm okay.

807
00:33:32,219 --> 00:33:33,518
It doesn't look weird.

808
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:34,788
- Is that so? - Yes.

809
00:33:34,789 --> 00:33:36,387
Should I wear my bag like this?

810
00:33:36,388 --> 00:33:38,428
Yes. Then it's completely covered up.

811
00:33:38,759 --> 00:33:40,088
It shows very slightly.

812
00:33:41,229 --> 00:33:42,999
No. It's fine as long as you don't get the wrong idea.

813
00:33:44,098 --> 00:33:46,939
- I love everything. - We'll finally go.

814
00:33:47,338 --> 00:33:49,068
Which yacht will it be?

815
00:33:49,168 --> 00:33:50,769
I'll be happy with any yacht.

816
00:33:50,908 --> 00:33:51,908
Is that the one?

817
00:33:55,678 --> 00:33:57,109
Today's date is amazing.

818
00:33:57,309 --> 00:33:58,678
We'll get to experience this?

819
00:34:00,048 --> 00:34:01,078
I'm a bit scared.

820
00:34:01,749 --> 00:34:02,819
It's scary.

821
00:34:05,488 --> 00:34:06,789
- Shall we check out the view first? - Yes. Let's go.

822
00:34:08,689 --> 00:34:10,959
- Are we setting sail now? - We're setting sail now.

823
00:34:13,258 --> 00:34:14,499
It feels great to be out on the water.

824
00:34:19,729 --> 00:34:21,097
Smell it. This is great.

825
00:34:21,098 --> 00:34:22,798
- Gosh. This is amazing. - It feels great to be on the water.

826
00:34:23,968 --> 00:34:26,569
Gosh, Cheol Hyeon. You look so photogenic here.

827
00:34:27,809 --> 00:34:28,839
Should I take a picture of you?

828
00:34:33,008 --> 00:34:34,118
The breeze feels so cool.

829
00:34:34,578 --> 00:34:35,879
I'm in a great mood.

830
00:34:42,019 --> 00:34:44,729
The scenes I saw in movies are flashing before my eyes right now.

831
00:34:45,258 --> 00:34:47,157
Getting the ocean breeze on the yacht...

832
00:34:47,158 --> 00:34:49,498
felt great. It was so refreshing.

833
00:34:49,499 --> 00:34:51,798
I had been wanting to ride the yacht.

834
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:53,368
It felt great.

835
00:34:53,669 --> 00:34:55,598
You look great in the pictures.

836
00:34:56,468 --> 00:34:58,839
- This is beautiful. - Isn't this great?

837
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:01,738
Can we really enjoy this luxury? Is it okay to be this happy here?

838
00:35:02,339 --> 00:35:04,649
Gosh, I'm so happy!

839
00:35:05,979 --> 00:35:06,979
I guess...

840
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,048
- some people go to this island. - You're right.

841
00:35:09,078 --> 00:35:11,548
- I wanted to lie down here. - Go ahead.

842
00:35:15,419 --> 00:35:17,258
It's so comfortable.

843
00:35:17,658 --> 00:35:19,729
I feel like I don't know where I am.

844
00:35:22,828 --> 00:35:24,899
It's raining. Sailing on a yacht in the rain.

845
00:35:27,499 --> 00:35:29,039
It'd be nice to lie down here too.

846
00:35:29,738 --> 00:35:31,109
- Can I lie down here? - Cheol Hyeon!

847
00:35:31,309 --> 00:35:33,908
You're the Korean Timothee Chalamet!

848
00:35:35,008 --> 00:35:37,908
- That's the vibe I got from you. - Come on.

849
00:35:38,908 --> 00:35:42,379
I'll give you a nickname. The Korean Timothee Chalamet.

850
00:35:42,649 --> 00:35:44,988
- You mean, Timothee Salami? - Salami?

851
00:35:45,289 --> 00:35:46,388
Timothee Ham.

852
00:35:49,019 --> 00:35:50,859
(The sun starts to set.)

853
00:35:52,158 --> 00:35:54,358
When it's pretty, you should enjoy it with your eyes.

854
00:35:54,359 --> 00:35:55,928
Se Seung.

855
00:35:56,559 --> 00:35:57,999
I got my hair on my face, right?

856
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:00,028
Yes. You got a lot of it.

857
00:36:01,598 --> 00:36:04,508
It covered my entire forehead.

858
00:36:14,678 --> 00:36:16,019
Aren't you cold? Is it okay?

859
00:36:16,118 --> 00:36:18,118
- I'm good. Are you cold? - No. I'm okay too.

860
00:36:19,019 --> 00:36:21,718
It's so nice as it becomes night.

861
00:36:21,959 --> 00:36:25,129
They say Singapore is more beautiful at night.

862
00:36:25,229 --> 00:36:26,258
Really?

863
00:36:26,629 --> 00:36:30,729
Now that you're holding a beer, you look like you're from the sea.

864
00:36:35,399 --> 00:36:36,439
Look over there!

865
00:36:39,468 --> 00:36:40,908
There are two colours now.

866
00:36:43,539 --> 00:36:44,809
- Oh, dear. - Goodness.

867
00:36:45,048 --> 00:36:46,678
Look at that reflected in the ocean.

868
00:36:46,948 --> 00:36:48,178
Money is indeed the best.

869
00:36:48,948 --> 00:36:50,748
It's so nice with the sunset.

870
00:36:50,749 --> 00:36:51,789
It's super nice.

871
00:36:51,848 --> 00:36:53,419
Who said you can have a romantic day with 50 dollars?

872
00:36:54,718 --> 00:36:56,519
Money is indeed the best.

873
00:36:56,988 --> 00:36:58,728
- Money rules. - Now, that's romantic.

874
00:36:58,729 --> 00:36:59,828
Yes. That's romantic.

875
00:37:00,158 --> 00:37:01,798
I should work hard.

876
00:37:05,968 --> 00:37:07,399
It's so beautiful.

877
00:37:10,408 --> 00:37:12,508
"Will I have this kind of experience again in my life?"

878
00:37:13,008 --> 00:37:14,609
It felt liberating.

879
00:37:15,138 --> 00:37:18,178
By the way, the sunset is beautiful only for a fleeting moment.

880
00:37:18,479 --> 00:37:22,348
I guess we've come all the way for this moment.

881
00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:29,358
- Are you enjoying this enough? - Totally.

882
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:31,488
- Are you enjoying this moment? - Two hundred percent.

883
00:37:32,388 --> 00:37:33,458
Me too.

884
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:35,499
We took a lot of photos of each other.

885
00:37:35,999 --> 00:37:37,129
It was romantic.

886
00:37:41,138 --> 00:37:42,169
You look pretty.

887
00:37:44,109 --> 00:37:45,539
You're a good photographer.

888
00:37:46,408 --> 00:37:48,038
Why do I look so tall?

889
00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:49,678
Let's say you're tall.

890
00:37:51,749 --> 00:37:53,278
My hair looks like a palm tree.

891
00:37:55,879 --> 00:37:57,019
Look at my hair.

892
00:37:57,649 --> 00:38:00,018
I feel like I'm going to fly away.

893
00:38:00,019 --> 00:38:01,859
You look like a doctor.

894
00:38:04,289 --> 00:38:06,028
That part looks like a sail.

895
00:38:22,109 --> 00:38:23,507
- The cafe sells kaya toast... - Yes.

896
00:38:23,508 --> 00:38:27,419
sweet coffee in Singaporean style.

897
00:38:30,319 --> 00:38:32,948
(Located in Chinatown)

898
00:38:35,819 --> 00:38:39,428
(An old cafe that opened in 1973)

899
00:38:41,729 --> 00:38:43,597
- It has a Hong Kong vibe in a way. - Yes.

900
00:38:43,598 --> 00:38:44,628
I know.

901
00:38:44,629 --> 00:38:46,768
- The colour reminds me of Venice. - Yes.

902
00:38:46,769 --> 00:38:50,098
(Cho A and Jae Hyung at Nanyang Old Coffee)

903
00:38:51,008 --> 00:38:52,008
After you.

904
00:38:52,209 --> 00:38:55,109
"Nanyang Old Coffee." This is it.

905
00:39:10,388 --> 00:39:11,388
It's here.

906
00:39:15,428 --> 00:39:17,028
It's super antique.

907
00:39:23,138 --> 00:39:24,637
(Kaya toast and Singaporean local coffee)

908
00:39:24,638 --> 00:39:25,908
- Thank you. - Thank you.

909
00:39:28,339 --> 00:39:30,238
- Do you dip it in here? - Yes.

910
00:39:31,309 --> 00:39:32,408
What does it taste like?

911
00:39:37,388 --> 00:39:38,388
(Exclaiming)

912
00:39:38,789 --> 00:39:40,348
It's so rich.

913
00:39:41,059 --> 00:39:42,519
I must take a photo of this.

914
00:39:48,098 --> 00:39:52,568
Which date was your favourite date so far?

915
00:39:52,569 --> 00:39:54,198
I feel like I know, though.

916
00:39:54,539 --> 00:39:55,939
Me? The date yesterday.

917
00:39:56,968 --> 00:39:59,738
I don't know why I'm so confused...

918
00:40:00,138 --> 00:40:02,678
as if I was a teenage boy.

919
00:40:02,809 --> 00:40:04,308
But I feel like...

920
00:40:04,309 --> 00:40:06,278
- this is my first time dating. - Does it feel like that?

921
00:40:08,678 --> 00:40:09,718
Really?

922
00:40:10,019 --> 00:40:12,019
- For real? - His heart is fluttering so much.

923
00:40:12,689 --> 00:40:14,019
- Was he that nervous? - I didn't know that.

924
00:40:14,218 --> 00:40:16,157
The way he put it...

925
00:40:16,158 --> 00:40:17,928
- sounds so genuine. Right? - Yes.

926
00:40:18,189 --> 00:40:19,488
Jae Hyung, for real?

927
00:40:19,729 --> 00:40:21,097
He's completely different from the beginning.

928
00:40:21,098 --> 00:40:23,428
Yes. I can feel his sincerity from his words too.

929
00:40:24,169 --> 00:40:25,768
I realized again...

930
00:40:25,769 --> 00:40:29,438
that I treat my female friends differently...

931
00:40:29,439 --> 00:40:32,738
from the girls I'm interested in.

932
00:40:33,069 --> 00:40:36,278
Once I like someone romantically,

933
00:40:36,379 --> 00:40:38,408
I can't be myself around them.

934
00:40:38,848 --> 00:40:40,478
- I become stiff. - Right.

935
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:42,448
- You feel like you become a fool. - Yes.

936
00:40:42,678 --> 00:40:45,888
Now that I think about it,

937
00:40:46,019 --> 00:40:47,718
I wonder if that was why...

938
00:40:47,959 --> 00:40:49,918
- I was uncomfortable around her. - Right.

939
00:40:49,919 --> 00:40:52,428
For some reason, she didn't make me feel comfortable.

940
00:40:54,459 --> 00:40:57,428
I think he liked her from the start.

941
00:40:59,298 --> 00:41:01,898
We didn't know what Jae Hyung was like,

942
00:41:01,899 --> 00:41:03,838
so we simply thought he gave up on her,

943
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:04,908
- but he didn't. - No.

944
00:41:05,269 --> 00:41:07,479
Do you think he liked her when they met at the rooftop?

945
00:41:07,578 --> 00:41:08,609
Yes.

946
00:41:09,138 --> 00:41:10,979
He talked about the squid for no reason.

947
00:41:11,249 --> 00:41:13,177
When the men had a choice to choose their date in Gangwon Province,

948
00:41:13,178 --> 00:41:15,978
he didn't pick Ji Won because he felt uncomfortable.

949
00:41:15,979 --> 00:41:16,979
- Right. - That feeling was...

950
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:19,588
Come to think of it, he was uncomfortable...

951
00:41:19,589 --> 00:41:21,018
- because he was into her. - Right.

952
00:41:21,019 --> 00:41:23,458
Right. When you like someone, you become tense.

953
00:41:23,459 --> 00:41:24,559
- Yes. - You can't be yourself.

954
00:41:24,658 --> 00:41:26,359
I wonder if that was why...

955
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:28,697
- I was uncomfortable around her. - Right.

956
00:41:28,698 --> 00:41:30,999
For some reason, she didn't make me feel comfortable.

957
00:41:32,428 --> 00:41:33,428
Right.

958
00:41:33,429 --> 00:41:34,938
(Laughing)

959
00:41:34,939 --> 00:41:36,498
I feel the same way.

960
00:41:36,499 --> 00:41:39,637
I always thought that feeling stable was the most important...

961
00:41:39,638 --> 00:41:42,478
and that I preferred someone comfortable...

962
00:41:42,479 --> 00:41:44,749
- before I moved in here. - I see.

963
00:41:45,149 --> 00:41:48,019
When we all first met, I liked someone else.

964
00:41:48,118 --> 00:41:49,479
I sent my text to them.

965
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:55,618
Then I realized I was wrong.

966
00:41:56,289 --> 00:42:00,358
I want to feel a little tense and nervous...

967
00:42:00,359 --> 00:42:01,858
around the person I'm into.

968
00:42:01,859 --> 00:42:04,368
- That's really important. - I think so.

969
00:42:04,928 --> 00:42:07,998
You might feel that way as soon as you meet the person...

970
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:09,697
- Right. - or later.

971
00:42:09,698 --> 00:42:12,138
- You can't even say that for sure. - Right.

972
00:42:13,269 --> 00:42:14,507
Could there be someone...

973
00:42:14,508 --> 00:42:17,348
whose choice changes completely within these three days?

974
00:42:17,548 --> 00:42:19,908
I'm not sure. That might be a little hard.

975
00:42:23,019 --> 00:42:24,089
You...

976
00:42:25,649 --> 00:42:26,789
Can I ask you this?

977
00:42:27,758 --> 00:42:31,328
Between your feelings for the person...

978
00:42:31,689 --> 00:42:35,328
and their feelings for you,

979
00:42:35,698 --> 00:42:38,399
which one do you think is stronger?

980
00:42:38,698 --> 00:42:40,269
Well, we can tell...

981
00:42:41,339 --> 00:42:42,468
whose feelings are stronger.

982
00:42:43,238 --> 00:42:45,867
I thought I could tell too.

983
00:42:45,868 --> 00:42:46,868
Yes.

984
00:42:46,869 --> 00:42:50,138
Then recently, I thought...

985
00:42:51,149 --> 00:42:52,878
that might not be true.

986
00:42:52,879 --> 00:42:56,149
"Because I was so certain about him,"

987
00:42:57,419 --> 00:42:58,688
"did I interpret his behaviour..."

988
00:42:58,689 --> 00:43:01,289
"based on how I perceived it?"

989
00:43:02,359 --> 00:43:03,388
I wondered.

990
00:43:03,919 --> 00:43:06,359
In terms of the density of my feelings,

991
00:43:06,459 --> 00:43:07,498
I'm completely packed.

992
00:43:07,499 --> 00:43:09,098
- Really? - When it comes to density.

993
00:43:09,999 --> 00:43:14,098
But recently, I experienced something that shook it up.

994
00:43:14,368 --> 00:43:17,339
You and Se Seung...

995
00:43:17,439 --> 00:43:18,808
- Are we similar? - said...

996
00:43:18,809 --> 00:43:20,408
- Is that so? - something really similar.

997
00:43:23,138 --> 00:43:25,109
She said something like that too.

998
00:43:25,379 --> 00:43:29,678
"Was I so focused on one person..."

999
00:43:29,819 --> 00:43:31,847
- "that it just went this way?" - It just went this way.

1000
00:43:31,848 --> 00:43:34,618
She said something like this.

1001
00:43:35,459 --> 00:43:37,688
I thought it was the opposite.

1002
00:43:37,689 --> 00:43:39,629
That Yong Woo's feelings were stronger.

1003
00:43:39,959 --> 00:43:41,458
One of the things she said...

1004
00:43:41,459 --> 00:43:45,169
was that it was her whose feelings were stronger.

1005
00:43:45,569 --> 00:43:48,468
She had deeper feelings for him.

1006
00:43:48,839 --> 00:43:53,939
It sounded like Yong Woo was taking his time to open his heart.

1007
00:43:57,778 --> 00:43:59,808
Here's something fascinating.

1008
00:43:59,809 --> 00:44:02,519
In one of our conversations recently,

1009
00:44:02,819 --> 00:44:05,488
he said he was doing things for me...

1010
00:44:05,749 --> 00:44:09,358
that he didn't normally do.

1011
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:11,028
He told me this directly.

1012
00:44:11,528 --> 00:44:13,129
- Okay. - But why does it make me...

1013
00:44:13,789 --> 00:44:15,598
feel more insecure?

1014
00:44:16,158 --> 00:44:17,258
I don't know why.

1015
00:44:18,298 --> 00:44:20,028
So here's what I think it is.

1016
00:44:20,368 --> 00:44:22,568
I was completely absorbed in my feelings,

1017
00:44:22,569 --> 00:44:24,868
- Then you snapped. - then I snapped out of it.

1018
00:44:25,709 --> 00:44:28,208
I might have been interpreting him...

1019
00:44:28,209 --> 00:44:31,278
based on what seemed fitting to me.

1020
00:44:31,908 --> 00:44:34,008
- That kind of feeling. - As soon as I felt that way,

1021
00:44:34,548 --> 00:44:38,649
the way I expressed my feelings became a little cold.

1022
00:44:38,988 --> 00:44:40,019
I see.

1023
00:44:41,459 --> 00:44:43,658
I think it's kind of a catalyst...

1024
00:44:43,859 --> 00:44:46,427
- to talk more to him... - Is that so?

1025
00:44:46,428 --> 00:44:48,758
and get to know him better.

1026
00:44:48,999 --> 00:44:52,468
I carefully assume that you're in that process.

1027
00:44:53,328 --> 00:44:55,968
That's what I think.

1028
00:44:56,499 --> 00:44:58,839
I felt the way I felt because he said this.

1029
00:44:59,138 --> 00:45:01,338
"I spent many opportunities..."

1030
00:45:01,339 --> 00:45:03,878
- "going out with one person." - Right.

1031
00:45:03,879 --> 00:45:05,778
He mentioned that yesterday.

1032
00:45:06,249 --> 00:45:09,118
Then he asked if that was okay with me.

1033
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:11,388
I see.

1034
00:45:12,249 --> 00:45:15,959
That question stirred up a lot of emotions in me.

1035
00:45:16,118 --> 00:45:17,218
- I see. - Yes.

1036
00:45:18,289 --> 00:45:20,487
- "Was he really worried about me?" - Right.

1037
00:45:20,488 --> 00:45:21,698
- "Or..." - Or...

1038
00:45:21,999 --> 00:45:23,958
- "Did he ask that..." - Right.

1039
00:45:23,959 --> 00:45:26,569
- "because he felt that way?" - Yes.

1040
00:45:26,769 --> 00:45:28,568
- That comment... - That's...

1041
00:45:28,569 --> 00:45:33,669
would have hurt her feelings deeply.

1042
00:45:34,339 --> 00:45:37,809
To be honest, he meant the latter.

1043
00:45:38,578 --> 00:45:41,318
If he really liked her, he wouldn't want to let her go.

1044
00:45:41,319 --> 00:45:43,018
She knew why,

1045
00:45:43,019 --> 00:45:45,189
- Of course, she did. - so her heart must have sunk too.

1046
00:45:47,388 --> 00:45:49,558
- "Was he really worried about me?" - Right.

1047
00:45:49,559 --> 00:45:50,718
- "Or..." - Or...

1048
00:45:51,028 --> 00:45:52,958
- "Did he ask that..." - Right.

1049
00:45:52,959 --> 00:45:55,658
- "because he felt that way?" - Yes.

1050
00:45:55,798 --> 00:45:59,098
That question stirred up a lot of emotions in me.

1051
00:45:59,499 --> 00:46:02,039
I'm not sure what Yong Woo meant, but...

1052
00:46:02,839 --> 00:46:04,638
I mean I don't know who he is.

1053
00:46:04,968 --> 00:46:09,038
Usually, what men say is...

1054
00:46:09,039 --> 00:46:10,878
straightforward.

1055
00:46:10,879 --> 00:46:12,608
If a guy asks if you're okay, he just wants to know if you are.

1056
00:46:12,609 --> 00:46:15,117
- Is that so? - Most of the time.

1057
00:46:15,118 --> 00:46:17,919
He doesn't seem...

1058
00:46:18,848 --> 00:46:22,358
the complicated type.

1059
00:46:22,359 --> 00:46:23,359
Right.

1060
00:46:23,689 --> 00:46:27,089
- He's very simple and clear. - You're right.

1061
00:46:27,488 --> 00:46:30,928
He must've been considerate of you when he said that,

1062
00:46:31,129 --> 00:46:33,927
but in a way, he might have wanted to check...

1063
00:46:33,928 --> 00:46:36,169
if you were feeling the same way.

1064
00:46:38,908 --> 00:46:40,838
I was in a somewhat confusing situation...

1065
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:42,638
when I was on a date with Jae Hyung.

1066
00:46:42,778 --> 00:46:45,778
So I asked him for advice.

1067
00:46:46,008 --> 00:46:48,578
It'd be nice to talk to him more.

1068
00:46:51,888 --> 00:46:52,947
Let's go.

1069
00:46:52,948 --> 00:46:54,218
(Ju Yeon and Yun Jae in 3rd place take off.)

1070
00:46:59,488 --> 00:47:01,458
By the way, I really want to have chilli crab.

1071
00:47:01,459 --> 00:47:03,428
I know. I hope we can have that for dinner.

1072
00:47:03,658 --> 00:47:05,229
You said you liked shellfish.

1073
00:47:06,028 --> 00:47:07,468
We can't go out tomorrow.

1074
00:47:08,298 --> 00:47:09,998
I must enjoy today.

1075
00:47:09,999 --> 00:47:12,439
Right. You were in the house all day yesterday.

1076
00:47:12,968 --> 00:47:14,309
We're the ones who should have the most fun today.

1077
00:47:15,039 --> 00:47:16,277
- Let's have a lot of fun. - Let's do that.

1078
00:47:16,278 --> 00:47:17,538
(Entering Sentosa Island)

1079
00:47:17,539 --> 00:47:20,309
"Sentosa?" What was this place?

1080
00:47:21,979 --> 00:47:24,948
(Going further on tree-lined road)

1081
00:47:27,189 --> 00:47:28,559
What is that?

1082
00:47:29,789 --> 00:47:31,158
- That beach. - Beach?

1083
00:47:31,658 --> 00:47:32,729
It's stunning.

1084
00:47:34,028 --> 00:47:35,197
- It's so beautiful. - It looks like a painting.

1085
00:47:35,198 --> 00:47:36,258
Look at the clouds.

1086
00:47:36,899 --> 00:47:39,069
- They look so pretty. - It's amazing.

1087
00:47:40,468 --> 00:47:41,539
It's super nice.

1088
00:47:50,678 --> 00:47:51,778
Isn't it cold?

1089
00:47:52,078 --> 00:47:54,278
- Is it okay? - Yes. The water is warm.

1090
00:47:58,019 --> 00:47:59,348
You look like...

1091
00:48:00,289 --> 00:48:02,459
- a senior in college. - A senior in college?

1092
00:48:02,959 --> 00:48:04,327
A senior who takes good photos of his juniors?

1093
00:48:04,328 --> 00:48:05,388
Yes.

1094
00:48:10,499 --> 00:48:11,798
You look so good in photos today.

1095
00:48:12,028 --> 00:48:14,198
It's hard to stay at home all day.

1096
00:48:14,499 --> 00:48:15,737
Ju Yeon loved the ocean...

1097
00:48:15,738 --> 00:48:17,568
and took lots of photos.

1098
00:48:17,569 --> 00:48:20,109
Seeing her like that, I thought I should...

1099
00:48:20,569 --> 00:48:22,539
make the date enjoyable and fun for her.

1100
00:48:24,309 --> 00:48:25,649
- Like this? - J looks already cool.

1101
00:48:37,189 --> 00:48:38,388
- It looks pretty good. - Good job.

1102
00:48:43,328 --> 00:48:44,768
(Ju Yeon and Yun Jae in Sentosa)

1103
00:48:44,769 --> 00:48:45,769
- Well written. - Yes.

1104
00:48:45,770 --> 00:48:47,769
- I did a great job. - Well done.

1105
00:48:56,638 --> 00:48:57,778
It's right in front of the ocean.

1106
00:48:58,008 --> 00:49:00,848
(Did you miss Yun Ha during the date?)

1107
00:49:01,008 --> 00:49:03,578
Yes, I did think of her from time to time.

1108
00:49:04,419 --> 00:49:05,788
When we were on the beach,

1109
00:49:05,789 --> 00:49:08,419
I thought, "I'd love to come back here with Yun Ha."

1110
00:49:11,789 --> 00:49:13,987
(Hortus)

1111
00:49:13,988 --> 00:49:15,158
The flowers look beautiful.

1112
00:49:15,399 --> 00:49:19,328
This place makes me feel like using my arm strength was worth it.

1113
00:49:20,028 --> 00:49:21,999
- It's gorgeous. - I know.

1114
00:49:27,908 --> 00:49:30,008
- There are lots of good dishes. - Is that so?

1115
00:49:33,749 --> 00:49:36,479
I get to enjoy this luxury thanks to my partner.

1116
00:49:36,819 --> 00:49:39,347
Jung Sub let me win so you can go to a nice place.

1117
00:49:39,348 --> 00:49:41,488
- Yes. My brother is like that. - Our Sub.

1118
00:49:41,589 --> 00:49:43,019
He yields and lets me have everything.

1119
00:49:43,118 --> 00:49:44,559
- Good job raising your brother. - Right?

1120
00:49:44,758 --> 00:49:46,229
Well, you did a much better job.

1121
00:49:46,359 --> 00:49:47,388
Raising my sister?

1122
00:49:48,028 --> 00:49:49,959
I should've taught her how to do chicken fight better.

1123
00:49:52,229 --> 00:49:53,629
Let me serve your appetizers.

1124
00:49:54,028 --> 00:49:55,038
Enjoy.

1125
00:49:55,039 --> 00:49:56,368
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1126
00:49:56,539 --> 00:49:57,769
Open your eyes wide.

1127
00:50:00,809 --> 00:50:01,809
Thank you for the food.

1128
00:50:01,810 --> 00:50:03,039
- Thank you for the food. - Enjoy.

1129
00:50:03,539 --> 00:50:06,148
What is this?

1130
00:50:06,149 --> 00:50:07,948
It tastes a little like...

1131
00:50:08,178 --> 00:50:09,618
- Hummus. - Hummus?

1132
00:50:09,948 --> 00:50:11,019
Chickpeas.

1133
00:50:12,589 --> 00:50:13,689
Is it good?

1134
00:50:14,689 --> 00:50:15,689
It's delicious.

1135
00:50:16,019 --> 00:50:17,718
During my short stay overseas,

1136
00:50:17,828 --> 00:50:19,359
I loved how the food suited my taste...

1137
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:20,689
even though it was completely different.

1138
00:50:21,428 --> 00:50:23,559
Especially the places like Chipotle.

1139
00:50:23,959 --> 00:50:25,028
Chipotle.

1140
00:50:26,598 --> 00:50:28,568
When did you first go abroad?

1141
00:50:28,569 --> 00:50:29,769
In 2016.

1142
00:50:30,198 --> 00:50:31,407
What about you?

1143
00:50:31,408 --> 00:50:35,178
It's similar. It was around 2017.

1144
00:50:35,678 --> 00:50:38,608
Now that I think about it, Yong Woo and I are...

1145
00:50:38,609 --> 00:50:39,777
the oldest children in our families.

1146
00:50:39,778 --> 00:50:41,978
We also lived abroad for a long time.

1147
00:50:41,979 --> 00:50:44,888
We have lots of things in common.

1148
00:50:45,319 --> 00:50:46,717
Things are different there,

1149
00:50:46,718 --> 00:50:48,819
so you shouldn't react there the way you do in Korea.

1150
00:50:48,988 --> 00:50:50,688
- Right. - They don't really like...

1151
00:50:50,689 --> 00:50:52,657
- quiet students. - True.

1152
00:50:52,658 --> 00:50:53,987
I've been to New Haven.

1153
00:50:53,988 --> 00:50:55,558
Really? Nobody knows New Haven.

1154
00:50:55,559 --> 00:50:57,298
- They say even Americans don't. - Right.

1155
00:50:57,598 --> 00:51:00,198
When I first went there, I couldn't even order coffee.

1156
00:51:00,298 --> 00:51:02,298
Drive-through orders are even harder.

1157
00:51:02,569 --> 00:51:03,938
When you're looking at the person,

1158
00:51:03,939 --> 00:51:06,968
- Right. You can feel something. - you feel something.

1159
00:51:07,269 --> 00:51:09,378
Can you finish a pint-sized mint chocolate chip ice cream...

1160
00:51:09,379 --> 00:51:10,608
by yourself?

1161
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:11,678
I totally can.

1162
00:51:17,348 --> 00:51:20,019
So did you find a Han Go Eun in our house?

1163
00:51:21,289 --> 00:51:22,459
In our house?

1164
00:51:25,059 --> 00:51:28,258
Someone seems to have a similar vibe.

1165
00:51:30,828 --> 00:51:32,428
Did you find someone with a nice nose?

1166
00:51:33,368 --> 00:51:34,839
Well, they all look good.

1167
00:51:35,098 --> 00:51:36,499
- Their noses? - Yes.

1168
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:40,069
Did you find someone good on the inside too?

1169
00:51:46,649 --> 00:51:49,019
Someone with good qualities...

1170
00:51:50,149 --> 00:51:52,117
- I think everyone is. - Everyone seems good?

1171
00:51:52,118 --> 00:51:54,988
Yes. That's what I think.

1172
00:51:58,089 --> 00:52:01,257
- Everyone has their own colour. - Everyone...

1173
00:52:01,258 --> 00:52:02,859
is charming in their own way.

1174
00:52:02,959 --> 00:52:06,399
Have you had many changes of heart here?

1175
00:52:06,528 --> 00:52:08,237
- So many. - Really?

1176
00:52:08,238 --> 00:52:09,367
What about you?

1177
00:52:09,368 --> 00:52:10,468
- Me? - Yes.

1178
00:52:11,039 --> 00:52:12,138
To be honest,

1179
00:52:12,669 --> 00:52:14,708
- I didn't try not to, - Okay.

1180
00:52:14,709 --> 00:52:16,408
but I haven't.

1181
00:52:16,979 --> 00:52:18,048
- For real? - Yes.

1182
00:52:19,508 --> 00:52:22,879
In retrospect, it must have been hard.

1183
00:52:23,178 --> 00:52:26,589
I guess I've had strong feelings.

1184
00:52:26,749 --> 00:52:28,019
You seem so relaxed.

1185
00:52:28,689 --> 00:52:30,888
- I am all of a sudden, right? - Yes.

1186
00:52:31,019 --> 00:52:32,189
I'm surprised too.

1187
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:37,328
Is that how you could handle every situation so calmly?

1188
00:52:38,269 --> 00:52:41,197
Was there a situation where I remained calm?

1189
00:52:41,198 --> 00:52:43,038
I think you've always been stable.

1190
00:52:43,039 --> 00:52:45,507
You didn't seem to have many emotional ups and downs.

1191
00:52:45,508 --> 00:52:47,439
Your feelings seemed consistent.

1192
00:52:48,008 --> 00:52:51,039
I could see other people's feelings fluctuate.

1193
00:52:51,408 --> 00:52:52,709
You know you can notice those things.

1194
00:52:53,348 --> 00:52:56,118
So are your feelings stable these days?

1195
00:52:58,419 --> 00:52:59,519
It's almost like...

1196
00:53:01,819 --> 00:53:03,218
- Do you feel stable now? - This is...

1197
00:53:03,789 --> 00:53:05,657
You know this is...

1198
00:53:05,658 --> 00:53:08,058
- one of the variables. - Right. Today's date.

1199
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:10,198
- This could become a rebellion. - Right.

1200
00:53:10,399 --> 00:53:11,768
(Gasping)

1201
00:53:11,769 --> 00:53:12,798
Yun Ha...

1202
00:53:13,328 --> 00:53:14,669
- Really? - Yun Ha.

1203
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:18,769
So are your feelings stable these days?

1204
00:53:20,939 --> 00:53:22,008
It's almost like...

1205
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:25,649
- Do you feel stable now? - This is...

1206
00:53:26,309 --> 00:53:28,077
You know this is...

1207
00:53:28,078 --> 00:53:30,547
- one of the variables. - Right. Today's date.

1208
00:53:30,548 --> 00:53:32,689
- This could become a rebellion. - Right.

1209
00:53:32,848 --> 00:53:34,248
(Gasping)

1210
00:53:34,249 --> 00:53:35,258
Yun Ha...

1211
00:53:35,888 --> 00:53:37,118
- Really? - Yun Ha.

1212
00:53:37,959 --> 00:53:40,328
- This date could become... - What?

1213
00:53:40,488 --> 00:53:43,528
She used a very important word, "rebellion."

1214
00:53:43,859 --> 00:53:45,097
When does a rebellion happen?

1215
00:53:45,098 --> 00:53:46,197
They happen during times of peace.

1216
00:53:46,198 --> 00:53:48,439
Things are stable and peaceful,

1217
00:53:48,598 --> 00:53:51,508
and this variable can turn everything upside down.

1218
00:53:51,738 --> 00:53:53,967
I feel like there'll be a turmoil once they receive the text,

1219
00:53:53,968 --> 00:53:57,039
"Who made your heart flutter today?"

1220
00:53:58,548 --> 00:53:59,749
- I'll concentrate. - Let's go. Let's concentrate.

1221
00:53:59,848 --> 00:54:00,979
Let's go.

1222
00:54:01,048 --> 00:54:03,249
They're talking until the sun goes down.

1223
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:05,289
Will they conspire in treason together?

1224
00:54:05,519 --> 00:54:06,618
Treason.

1225
00:54:07,348 --> 00:54:09,257
You know this is...

1226
00:54:09,258 --> 00:54:11,628
- one of the variables. - Right. Today's date.

1227
00:54:11,629 --> 00:54:13,729
- This could become a rebellion. - Right.

1228
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:16,399
- You might suddenly feel something. - Right.

1229
00:54:17,028 --> 00:54:19,428
- That could happen. - Yes.

1230
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:22,098
I can't believe we only have three days left now.

1231
00:54:22,399 --> 00:54:24,709
- I know. - I can't believe it.

1232
00:54:26,039 --> 00:54:28,677
Who did you talk to the most among the girls?

1233
00:54:28,678 --> 00:54:29,737
- Among the girls? - Yes.

1234
00:54:29,738 --> 00:54:31,408
Your ex-roommate?

1235
00:54:32,379 --> 00:54:33,479
- Cho A? - Yes.

1236
00:54:34,109 --> 00:54:37,019
But she went to work every day, and I always went out too.

1237
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:38,888
You couldn't spend much time together.

1238
00:54:39,019 --> 00:54:40,789
I love everyone,

1239
00:54:41,019 --> 00:54:43,518
but I got closer to Ji Won lately.

1240
00:54:43,519 --> 00:54:45,559
- Really? - We got closer.

1241
00:54:45,758 --> 00:54:47,959
It's so funny how it works here.

1242
00:54:48,399 --> 00:54:51,967
Spending time with different people can really change...

1243
00:54:51,968 --> 00:54:53,598
- Right. - how close you feel to them.

1244
00:54:53,729 --> 00:54:56,738
- You're right. That's true. - That plays a big role.

1245
00:54:57,198 --> 00:54:59,039
What you said is so right.

1246
00:54:59,468 --> 00:55:01,008
It's just about that.

1247
00:55:01,408 --> 00:55:03,339
It's about how much you spend the most time with.

1248
00:55:04,979 --> 00:55:06,448
I had...

1249
00:55:07,008 --> 00:55:08,248
- some kind of an enlightenment. - Realization?

1250
00:55:08,249 --> 00:55:10,749
You look like you got hit by something.

1251
00:55:10,879 --> 00:55:12,518
Something quickly passed through my mind.

1252
00:55:12,519 --> 00:55:13,717
You're right.

1253
00:55:13,718 --> 00:55:15,559
The person you spend the most time with...

1254
00:55:15,789 --> 00:55:18,559
becomes the brother of the person you're into.

1255
00:55:18,658 --> 00:55:20,559
- They could be their sibling. - Yes.

1256
00:55:21,499 --> 00:55:22,798
You're right.

1257
00:55:23,999 --> 00:55:26,498
- So I got a lot closer to Ji Won... - Ji Won.

1258
00:55:26,499 --> 00:55:27,698
because we spent a lot of time together.

1259
00:55:27,899 --> 00:55:29,737
When did you spend time together?

1260
00:55:29,738 --> 00:55:30,797
- Me and Ji Won? - Yes.

1261
00:55:30,798 --> 00:55:32,039
We came to Singapore together.

1262
00:55:32,939 --> 00:55:36,407
- Right. - Our rooms are close too.

1263
00:55:36,408 --> 00:55:38,709
- We talked a lot too. - Right.

1264
00:55:40,479 --> 00:55:41,678
Ji Won is fun...

1265
00:55:42,278 --> 00:55:44,677
- when you talk to her. - She's easygoing.

1266
00:55:44,678 --> 00:55:45,848
She's a fun person.

1267
00:55:46,589 --> 00:55:48,959
Actually, I've even had this thought.

1268
00:55:49,789 --> 00:55:51,758
Since a certain point,

1269
00:55:52,289 --> 00:55:54,289
that person and I...

1270
00:55:54,729 --> 00:55:57,198
only spent time with each other.

1271
00:55:57,598 --> 00:56:02,068
I wondered if that wasn't good and if it was restraining them.

1272
00:56:02,069 --> 00:56:03,698
I told them too.

1273
00:56:07,109 --> 00:56:08,978
What I felt was...

1274
00:56:08,979 --> 00:56:11,408
- I said I came to a realization. - Yes.

1275
00:56:12,908 --> 00:56:14,007
Here's what I meant.

1276
00:56:14,008 --> 00:56:15,818
- I rarely drink. - Okay.

1277
00:56:15,819 --> 00:56:17,048
I suddenly thought,

1278
00:56:17,519 --> 00:56:20,789
"Who did I drink the most with?"

1279
00:56:22,059 --> 00:56:23,818
"I spent quite some time with this person."

1280
00:56:23,819 --> 00:56:25,558
These thoughts suddenly came to mind.

1281
00:56:25,559 --> 00:56:26,559
I see.

1282
00:56:28,028 --> 00:56:29,757
Jung Sub was always there.

1283
00:56:29,758 --> 00:56:30,798
Right.

1284
00:56:31,399 --> 00:56:33,327
Yun Jae and Ji Won were always there.

1285
00:56:33,328 --> 00:56:34,468
- Right? - It's true.

1286
00:56:34,629 --> 00:56:37,868
- Cho A didn't really join us. - Right.

1287
00:56:38,368 --> 00:56:40,467
She wasn't at home most of the time anyway.

1288
00:56:40,468 --> 00:56:41,539
Yes.

1289
00:56:45,149 --> 00:56:47,048
When was your favourite moment since you moved in?

1290
00:56:47,778 --> 00:56:49,777
- Since we came to Singapore, - Singapore?

1291
00:56:49,778 --> 00:56:51,249
- I've been having a lot of fun. - Is that so?

1292
00:56:51,548 --> 00:56:53,848
- More fun than when you were there? - Yes. What about you?

1293
00:56:54,089 --> 00:56:56,618
I liked every moment, but what was memorable was...

1294
00:56:57,258 --> 00:56:58,427
- Gangneung? - Yes.

1295
00:56:58,428 --> 00:57:01,289
I had a lot of fun in Gangneung too.

1296
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:06,498
"Have we not talked at all?"

1297
00:57:06,499 --> 00:57:08,499
Surprisingly, we barely talked before.

1298
00:57:08,798 --> 00:57:10,838
Since I first met him,

1299
00:57:10,839 --> 00:57:13,507
I knew that we were very similar.

1300
00:57:13,508 --> 00:57:17,007
I guess that's why I picked him...

1301
00:57:17,008 --> 00:57:18,879
based on my first impressions.

1302
00:57:19,209 --> 00:57:21,547
Now we're not far away...

1303
00:57:21,548 --> 00:57:25,149
from the final selection date.

1304
00:57:25,919 --> 00:57:27,488
When it comes to feelings...

1305
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:30,589
If we had more time,

1306
00:57:31,519 --> 00:57:35,059
I could develop feelings for him, to be honest.

1307
00:57:36,028 --> 00:57:37,697
"If we had more time,"

1308
00:57:37,698 --> 00:57:40,368
"could things go differently?"

1309
00:57:42,039 --> 00:57:43,798
Did you expect...

1310
00:57:44,198 --> 00:57:47,468
to go on a date with me?

1311
00:57:48,778 --> 00:57:51,038
- Yes. When we got a call... - The Ring-ring Date.

1312
00:57:51,039 --> 00:57:52,908
- During the Ring-ring Date. - You expected it then?

1313
00:57:53,178 --> 00:57:54,919
From what I think,

1314
00:57:55,278 --> 00:57:58,649
I tried going out with different people,

1315
00:57:59,249 --> 00:58:02,019
but then at some point, I only went on dates with one person.

1316
00:58:02,189 --> 00:58:04,189
- Is that so? How many dates? - Four dates.

1317
00:58:05,488 --> 00:58:08,758
Well, so I feel like we went back to the beginning.

1318
00:58:09,028 --> 00:58:10,098
- I see. - Yes.

1319
00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:13,798
I went out with someone else after a long time.

1320
00:58:14,069 --> 00:58:16,768
That's why every comment...

1321
00:58:16,769 --> 00:58:19,138
felt new and refreshing.

1322
00:58:19,339 --> 00:58:22,039
I kept having moments...

1323
00:58:22,979 --> 00:58:26,109
when I looked back on my past weeks.

1324
00:58:26,448 --> 00:58:27,879
She's the best.

1325
00:58:28,078 --> 00:58:30,819
She makes me feel like I can tell her everything.

1326
00:58:31,278 --> 00:58:32,919
- Shall we get going? - Yes.

1327
00:58:33,919 --> 00:58:34,958
I enjoyed the meal.

1328
00:58:34,959 --> 00:58:36,318
- It was a good meal. - Yes.

1329
00:58:36,319 --> 00:58:37,888
- It was delicious. - I know.

1330
00:58:39,729 --> 00:58:42,399
(Ju Yeon and Yun Jae are headed to the next location.)

1331
00:58:43,028 --> 00:58:45,028
Yun Jae, you remind me of a character.

1332
00:58:45,798 --> 00:58:48,098
- Character? - Has anyone said that?

1333
00:58:48,638 --> 00:58:51,367
- Otter? - Otter? You look like an otter.

1334
00:58:51,368 --> 00:58:52,868
- Otter. - I see the resemblance.

1335
00:58:54,269 --> 00:58:56,208
- Bonobono. You look like it. - Bonobono.

1336
00:58:56,209 --> 00:58:57,879
Right. You look like Bonobono.

1337
00:58:58,008 --> 00:58:59,608
Bonobono is a sea otter, but...

1338
00:58:59,609 --> 00:59:01,379
You kind of look like Chipmunk.

1339
00:59:01,578 --> 00:59:02,777
You look like Chipmunk.

1340
00:59:02,778 --> 00:59:04,547
- It's the pink one, right? - Chipmunk. Wait.

1341
00:59:04,548 --> 00:59:05,618
Right.

1342
00:59:06,189 --> 00:59:08,459
- You're Chipmunk. - What does it look like?

1343
00:59:10,459 --> 00:59:12,388
Well, I guess I do look like it.

1344
00:59:12,658 --> 00:59:14,858
- You're Chipmunk. - I see the resemblance.

1345
00:59:14,859 --> 00:59:16,197
It's hilarious.

1346
00:59:16,198 --> 00:59:19,198
Something weird was added to the list.

1347
00:59:21,569 --> 00:59:22,738
I think it's here.

1348
00:59:22,899 --> 00:59:24,338
Isn't it a night market?

1349
00:59:24,339 --> 00:59:26,439
- Yes. Shall we go? Thank you. - Thank you.

1350
00:59:29,678 --> 00:59:32,347
- I can't get used to it. - This place is exotic.

1351
00:59:32,348 --> 00:59:33,948
I know. This is nice.

1352
00:59:35,448 --> 00:59:36,979
(Haji Lane)

1353
00:59:39,448 --> 00:59:41,348
(A narrow alley where diverse cultures coexist)

1354
00:59:42,218 --> 00:59:44,518
(A place where you can find colourful pubs...)

1355
00:59:44,519 --> 00:59:45,628
(and vibrant murals)

1356
00:59:45,629 --> 00:59:46,689
It's so pretty.

1357
00:59:49,059 --> 00:59:51,197
Yun Jae. We should...

1358
00:59:51,198 --> 00:59:53,867
- Swimwear. We should really get it. - We should definitely get it.

1359
00:59:53,868 --> 00:59:54,998
I like this better.

1360
00:59:54,999 --> 00:59:56,297
This is better? Okay.

1361
00:59:56,298 --> 00:59:58,708
Should we buy something like sandals?

1362
00:59:58,709 --> 01:00:00,408
It sounds good.

1363
01:00:00,738 --> 01:00:02,677
- Like matching items. - Right.

1364
01:00:02,678 --> 01:00:05,408
The bracelets look good too, right?

1365
01:00:07,548 --> 01:00:09,879
- You have pretty hands. - I do?

1366
01:00:10,348 --> 01:00:12,019
- Should we get this? - This one?

1367
01:00:12,488 --> 01:00:15,819
We got matching bracelets to remember today.

1368
01:00:16,319 --> 01:00:18,887
(They got matching bracelets although they speak formally.)

1369
01:00:18,888 --> 01:00:21,658
I've been wearing it since that evening.

1370
01:00:22,658 --> 01:00:24,197
I got a good one thanks to you.

1371
01:00:24,198 --> 01:00:25,927
- Let's get out. - Yes.

1372
01:00:25,928 --> 01:00:27,629
(Mandarin Oriental)

1373
01:00:37,309 --> 01:00:38,378
Gosh.

1374
01:00:38,379 --> 01:00:40,708
- I'm so glad it's outside. - It's so nice.

1375
01:00:40,709 --> 01:00:42,378
- It's a relief. - The weather is also great.

1376
01:00:42,379 --> 01:00:44,678
- Should we sit here? - This is the prettiest spot.

1377
01:00:45,348 --> 01:00:48,618
- Oh, my. - Gosh.

1378
01:00:48,888 --> 01:00:51,658
What's behind you is the view of those buildings.

1379
01:00:59,169 --> 01:01:01,298
There's a swimming pool right here.

1380
01:01:04,138 --> 01:01:06,508
Is it okay for us to enjoy such a luxury?

1381
01:01:06,609 --> 01:01:07,939
It's thanks to you.

1382
01:01:08,238 --> 01:01:09,238
You're the best.

1383
01:01:10,939 --> 01:01:13,177
- That looks so pretty. - Seriously.

1384
01:01:13,178 --> 01:01:14,578
The night view is amazing.

1385
01:01:14,778 --> 01:01:16,478
Let's eat a lot of delicious food.

1386
01:01:16,479 --> 01:01:18,278
Let's eat a lot.

1387
01:01:21,019 --> 01:01:22,888
- Cheers. - Cheers.

1388
01:01:23,158 --> 01:01:25,019
Let's enjoy the luxury.

1389
01:01:25,959 --> 01:01:27,027
Here it is.

1390
01:01:27,028 --> 01:01:28,797
- Thank you. - It's chicken.

1391
01:01:28,798 --> 01:01:29,798
It looks good.

1392
01:01:30,328 --> 01:01:32,728
People told me to take pictures earlier.

1393
01:01:32,729 --> 01:01:35,468
"Take pictures of what you eat."

1394
01:01:35,698 --> 01:01:37,237
It looks good.

1395
01:01:37,238 --> 01:01:39,568
- Let's enjoy it. - Let's enjoy it.

1396
01:01:39,569 --> 01:01:42,138
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

1397
01:01:42,738 --> 01:01:43,939
What was the name of this pasta dish?

1398
01:01:44,479 --> 01:01:46,508
- Bolognese. - Bolognese.

1399
01:01:49,718 --> 01:01:51,117
- It's so good. - I'm so happy.

1400
01:01:51,118 --> 01:01:52,388
- I'm so happy. - I'm so happy.

1401
01:01:53,419 --> 01:01:54,589
Do you have an English name?

1402
01:01:54,848 --> 01:01:56,018
- My name? - You look like a Max.

1403
01:01:56,019 --> 01:01:57,358
Or an Andrew.

1404
01:01:57,359 --> 01:01:59,758
- Me? Andrew? - Yes. You look like an Andrew.

1405
01:02:00,488 --> 01:02:03,398
- I need to change my name. - So what is it?

1406
01:02:03,399 --> 01:02:05,098
- It's James. - James?

1407
01:02:05,198 --> 01:02:07,868
James sounds...

1408
01:02:07,999 --> 01:02:10,197
- a little cheesy to me. - "Cheesy?"

1409
01:02:10,198 --> 01:02:12,039
Cheesy.

1410
01:02:12,769 --> 01:02:16,438
But James is the name my mom thought of.

1411
01:02:16,439 --> 01:02:17,577
Your mom?

1412
01:02:17,578 --> 01:02:19,979
That's such a cool name. Why?

1413
01:02:21,749 --> 01:02:22,749
You mom gave you the name?

1414
01:02:23,118 --> 01:02:25,748
Yes. My mom likes James Bond.

1415
01:02:25,749 --> 01:02:27,918
"Let me call you James." That's how it happened.

1416
01:02:27,919 --> 01:02:30,988
James suits you so well.

1417
01:02:31,118 --> 01:02:32,588
What's your English name?

1418
01:02:32,589 --> 01:02:33,888
Me? Elly.

1419
01:02:34,189 --> 01:02:35,297
- Elly? - Yes.

1420
01:02:35,298 --> 01:02:37,228
- How about Kelly? - Kelly?

1421
01:02:37,229 --> 01:02:38,398
- The delivery. - Kelly?

1422
01:02:38,399 --> 01:02:39,928
(He blurts out anything as he's hungry.)

1423
01:02:40,968 --> 01:02:42,038
(Growling)

1424
01:02:42,039 --> 01:02:44,398
- Kelly. - My stomach growled.

1425
01:02:44,399 --> 01:02:45,907
Was it you?

1426
01:02:45,908 --> 01:02:47,339
I thought it was the car.

1427
01:02:47,439 --> 01:02:49,277
(The sound was quite heavy.)

1428
01:02:49,278 --> 01:02:51,109
It wasn't that loud.

1429
01:02:51,238 --> 01:02:53,749
It was a cute sound.

1430
01:02:54,048 --> 01:02:56,149
- Right. - Why am I so hungry?

1431
01:02:56,249 --> 01:02:58,277
The place we're going to is...

1432
01:02:58,278 --> 01:03:00,387
I should check the prices.

1433
01:03:00,388 --> 01:03:02,189
It's from 20 dollars to 30 dollars.

1434
01:03:03,218 --> 01:03:04,459
We'll barely eat.

1435
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:06,189
"Per person?"

1436
01:03:06,859 --> 01:03:07,887
Per person?

1437
01:03:07,888 --> 01:03:09,028
(They only have 35 dollars left.)

1438
01:03:09,729 --> 01:03:10,798
We're doomed.

1439
01:03:11,129 --> 01:03:13,028
Now, we...

1440
01:03:13,629 --> 01:03:16,198
(The place they arrived at while feeling hungry)

1441
01:03:17,339 --> 01:03:20,507
(A night market that opens among skyscrapers every night)

1442
01:03:20,508 --> 01:03:21,907
(Lau Pa Sat Satay Street)

1443
01:03:21,908 --> 01:03:23,237
(During the day, it's a road where cars pass by,)

1444
01:03:23,238 --> 01:03:26,448
(but every evening from 7pm, it's closed off for skewer stalls.)

1445
01:03:44,899 --> 01:03:48,999
(Ji Won and Jung Sub in Lau Pa Sat)

1446
01:03:51,298 --> 01:03:54,008
- Gosh. - Oh, my.

1447
01:03:54,209 --> 01:03:56,238
- This is crazy. - This is amazing.

1448
01:03:56,408 --> 01:03:59,378
- Gosh, it looks so good. - It looks delicious.

1449
01:03:59,379 --> 01:04:01,649
- Oh, my. - It looks so good.

1450
01:04:01,809 --> 01:04:02,978
- Oh, my gosh. It looks so... - I...

1451
01:04:02,979 --> 01:04:04,978
- I want to try the chicken skewer. - It's so nice.

1452
01:04:04,979 --> 01:04:06,788
It'd be amazing just to smell it.

1453
01:04:06,789 --> 01:04:09,688
I honestly like this kind of food more than expensive ones.

1454
01:04:09,689 --> 01:04:12,028
- It's the real deal. - It's the real deal.

1455
01:04:12,129 --> 01:04:14,788
- We have pho, sister. - It looks good.

1456
01:04:14,789 --> 01:04:16,398
His Korean is so good. "Sister."

1457
01:04:16,399 --> 01:04:18,327
- Did he say "sister?" - He called me sister.

1458
01:04:18,328 --> 01:04:19,328
I'm not going there.

1459
01:04:21,298 --> 01:04:22,738
It looks so good.

1460
01:04:22,999 --> 01:04:24,568
The shrimp look delicious.

1461
01:04:24,569 --> 01:04:26,939
I love it. This is crazy.

1462
01:04:27,039 --> 01:04:29,209
Thank you.

1463
01:04:29,809 --> 01:04:32,209
(The food that makes their eyes widen)

1464
01:04:33,408 --> 01:04:34,847
- This is for two people. - I think we should eat this.

1465
01:04:34,848 --> 01:04:36,378
- This is for three people. - Is it...

1466
01:04:36,379 --> 01:04:39,018
- I think we should eat this. - This one is for how many people?

1467
01:04:39,019 --> 01:04:40,548
- It's for 2 people. - For 2 people?

1468
01:04:40,789 --> 01:04:42,387
- It's nice. - Yes. It's nice.

1469
01:04:42,388 --> 01:04:45,288
It's 28 Singapore dollars, and we got 35.

1470
01:04:45,289 --> 01:04:47,459
Then we'll have seven Singapore dollars left.

1471
01:04:48,129 --> 01:04:49,197
Okay.

1472
01:04:49,198 --> 01:04:50,827
(They'll have as much as 7 dollars after ordering a set for 2 people.)

1473
01:04:50,828 --> 01:04:51,858
Excuse me.

1474
01:04:51,859 --> 01:04:55,197
What can we buy for seven dollars?

1475
01:04:55,198 --> 01:04:56,467
Seven dollars? Nothing.

1476
01:04:56,468 --> 01:04:57,768
(7 dollars? Nothing.)

1477
01:04:57,769 --> 01:05:00,109
- "Seven dollars? Nothing." - "Seven dollars? Nothing."

1478
01:05:00,209 --> 01:05:01,237
Okay.

1479
01:05:01,238 --> 01:05:03,638
- "Seven dollars? Nothing." - "Nothing."

1480
01:05:04,278 --> 01:05:06,278
Okay. So sad.

1481
01:05:07,048 --> 01:05:08,678
Wait. It's here.

1482
01:05:09,319 --> 01:05:11,077
- It's 11 dollars? - It's 11 dollars.

1483
01:05:11,078 --> 01:05:12,217
We can't.

1484
01:05:12,218 --> 01:05:14,248
We have only seven dollars.

1485
01:05:14,249 --> 01:05:16,157
- Chocolate drinks. - Or we could get a Coke Zero.

1486
01:05:16,158 --> 01:05:17,288
It's two dollars.

1487
01:05:17,289 --> 01:05:19,158
We can afford it if it's two dollars.

1488
01:05:19,459 --> 01:05:22,898
Let's get two of these and set A from earlier.

1489
01:05:22,899 --> 01:05:24,558
- That will do. - We'll have three dollars left.

1490
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:27,327
- We can get something we want... - For three dollars.

1491
01:05:27,328 --> 01:05:28,467
for three dollars.

1492
01:05:28,468 --> 01:05:30,398
We were so frugal.

1493
01:05:30,399 --> 01:05:31,668
I like things like this.

1494
01:05:31,669 --> 01:05:34,908
Spending within the budget.

1495
01:05:36,408 --> 01:05:38,339
We have three dollars left.

1496
01:05:38,479 --> 01:05:40,809
- I'm so sad. - We have three dollars left.

1497
01:05:41,008 --> 01:05:43,777
- This is nice. It smells so good. - It smells amazing.

1498
01:05:43,778 --> 01:05:46,089
- We smell it instead of eating it. - That's what we're doing.

1499
01:05:46,519 --> 01:05:48,348
(They're eating the smell.)

1500
01:05:48,689 --> 01:05:50,758
- It's so delicious. - Yes, it's so good.

1501
01:05:51,488 --> 01:05:53,959
- Shall we try it? - Yes.

1502
01:05:54,789 --> 01:05:57,197
Let's eat quickly. Here.

1503
01:05:57,198 --> 01:05:59,129
Thank you.

1504
01:06:02,399 --> 01:06:03,399
Gosh.

1505
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:05,407
(Lightheaded)

1506
01:06:05,408 --> 01:06:06,638
Gosh.

1507
01:06:07,309 --> 01:06:08,339
What's this?

1508
01:06:08,638 --> 01:06:10,938
- It's so good that it makes me mad. - This is insane.

1509
01:06:10,939 --> 01:06:12,847
Would you like to try the meat I'm giving to you?

1510
01:06:12,848 --> 01:06:13,848
Yes.

1511
01:06:18,448 --> 01:06:20,019
- Oh, my. - How is it?

1512
01:06:21,488 --> 01:06:22,617
The shrimp is crazy.

1513
01:06:22,618 --> 01:06:23,717
(Laughing)

1514
01:06:23,718 --> 01:06:24,789
Is it crazy?

1515
01:06:25,289 --> 01:06:26,289
Let's put them together.

1516
01:06:27,729 --> 01:06:28,999
It does look like a heart.

1517
01:06:29,629 --> 01:06:30,797
(A shrimp heart)

1518
01:06:30,798 --> 01:06:32,269
In 1, 2, 3.

1519
01:06:37,698 --> 01:06:40,439
This is the best shrimp I've ever had in my life.

1520
01:06:40,638 --> 01:06:42,538
- It's so good. - It feels like a paradise...

1521
01:06:42,539 --> 01:06:43,809
as I'm eating this...

1522
01:06:44,408 --> 01:06:45,649
in a state like this.

1523
01:06:46,778 --> 01:06:48,577
- It's interesting. - Yes.

1524
01:06:48,578 --> 01:06:51,378
Eating skewers among tall buildings.

1525
01:06:51,379 --> 01:06:52,447
That's what I'm saying.

1526
01:06:52,448 --> 01:06:54,748
Lau Pa Sat...

1527
01:06:54,749 --> 01:06:58,318
had the atmosphere I really like.

1528
01:06:58,319 --> 01:06:59,827
It's a skewer street,

1529
01:06:59,828 --> 01:07:03,257
but it's surrounded...

1530
01:07:03,258 --> 01:07:05,398
by fancy skyscrapers,

1531
01:07:05,399 --> 01:07:08,398
which was very interesting and fun.

1532
01:07:08,399 --> 01:07:11,367
You can't say you visited Singapore if you haven't been here.

1533
01:07:11,368 --> 01:07:13,738
- Right. I want to come again. - Yes.

1534
01:07:14,868 --> 01:07:18,907
We're surrounded by tall buildings and...

1535
01:07:18,908 --> 01:07:20,608
How much is it?

1536
01:07:20,609 --> 01:07:21,808
Three dollars.

1537
01:07:21,809 --> 01:07:22,847
(They only have 3 dollars left.)

1538
01:07:22,848 --> 01:07:24,918
- How much is this? - Two dollars.

1539
01:07:24,919 --> 01:07:25,919
Two dollars?

1540
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:28,448
- She gave it to you. - Thank you so much.

1541
01:07:28,689 --> 01:07:29,717
Okay.

1542
01:07:29,718 --> 01:07:30,718
- Two dollars? - Yes.

1543
01:07:30,719 --> 01:07:32,387
An old lady came.

1544
01:07:32,388 --> 01:07:34,188
People should peel the shrimp.

1545
01:07:34,189 --> 01:07:35,827
So she was selling wet wipes there.

1546
01:07:35,828 --> 01:07:38,197
She knows how to sell.

1547
01:07:38,198 --> 01:07:40,069
She came where people needed wet wipes.

1548
01:07:40,698 --> 01:07:41,698
I'll give it to her.

1549
01:07:42,298 --> 01:07:44,898
Two dollars? Thank you.

1550
01:07:44,899 --> 01:07:48,138
(They pay 2 dollars to the genius seller as if they're in a trance.)

1551
01:07:48,339 --> 01:07:49,808
- We're spending wisely. - Yes.

1552
01:07:49,809 --> 01:07:51,177
We spent exactly within the budget.

1553
01:07:51,178 --> 01:07:53,577
- We didn't even leave a coin. - We didn't even leave a coin.

1554
01:07:53,578 --> 01:07:54,649
We have one dollar.

1555
01:07:54,778 --> 01:07:56,749
- We have 1 dollar left? - Yes. We have 1 dollar left.

1556
01:07:57,278 --> 01:07:58,988
- I'm still hungry, though. - The shrimp is so good.

1557
01:07:59,488 --> 01:08:01,047
Can we not eat this part?

1558
01:08:01,048 --> 01:08:02,089
I don't know.

1559
01:08:04,019 --> 01:08:05,958
(He eats the shrimp head.)

1560
01:08:06,958 --> 01:08:08,059
You can't eat it, can you?

1561
01:08:08,588 --> 01:08:09,698
Can you eat it?

1562
01:08:09,699 --> 01:08:10,798
I just tried it.

1563
01:08:11,859 --> 01:08:13,029
I think I can eat it.

1564
01:08:14,069 --> 01:08:16,699
(He chews the shrimp tail.)

1565
01:08:18,338 --> 01:08:22,877
Jung Sub tried hard...

1566
01:08:22,878 --> 01:08:25,439
to eat every part of the shrimp.

1567
01:08:25,678 --> 01:08:27,548
I felt bad for him.

1568
01:08:28,918 --> 01:08:30,178
Eat this.

1569
01:08:31,119 --> 01:08:32,748
Really? Thank you.

1570
01:08:33,619 --> 01:08:34,918
(Eating)

1571
01:08:37,619 --> 01:08:38,688
(Someone sits next to them with broth at that moment.)

1572
01:08:38,689 --> 01:08:40,828
I want to order a lot of shrimp.

1573
01:08:40,829 --> 01:08:43,628
- I know. - Beer and shrimp.

1574
01:08:44,399 --> 01:08:46,229
- We... - It looks so good.

1575
01:08:47,829 --> 01:08:50,238
If she was Korean, I would've talked to her right away.

1576
01:08:50,239 --> 01:08:52,368
Now that I ate some, I can see...

1577
01:08:52,369 --> 01:08:53,369
- the surroundings. - I know.

1578
01:08:54,269 --> 01:08:55,338
(Glancing)

1579
01:08:55,508 --> 01:08:57,378
(Their eyes are fixed on the next table.)

1580
01:08:57,439 --> 01:08:59,608
It'd be amazing if she could give us...

1581
01:08:59,609 --> 01:09:01,449
a bite of noodles.

1582
01:09:01,878 --> 01:09:03,618
Should we push our table a little bit?

1583
01:09:03,619 --> 01:09:06,388
(Trying to sit together)

1584
01:09:07,218 --> 01:09:08,218
- That's a good idea. - Put them together.

1585
01:09:08,219 --> 01:09:10,159
Put them together.

1586
01:09:10,859 --> 01:09:11,918
(Shaking)

1587
01:09:15,859 --> 01:09:18,399
I kept looking at the table next to us.

1588
01:09:18,928 --> 01:09:20,198
I kept looking.

1589
01:09:20,199 --> 01:09:22,869
The lady who sat at the next table...

1590
01:09:23,038 --> 01:09:25,809
and I made eye contact about 15 times.

1591
01:09:26,138 --> 01:09:27,668
But she didn't give anything to me.

1592
01:09:28,168 --> 01:09:31,708
It was my ninth time I made eye contact with her.

1593
01:09:32,138 --> 01:09:34,208
She might give it to me soon.

1594
01:09:37,079 --> 01:09:38,619
I'll make something good at home.

1595
01:09:38,819 --> 01:09:40,949
- Let's have a second round at home. - Let's do it.

1596
01:09:41,619 --> 01:09:44,458
You ate only a little.

1597
01:09:44,788 --> 01:09:47,627
I'm full just by watching you eat.

1598
01:09:47,628 --> 01:09:49,029
Oh, my gosh.

1599
01:09:49,298 --> 01:09:51,228
Going out with Ji Won...

1600
01:09:51,229 --> 01:09:53,467
for the first time,

1601
01:09:53,468 --> 01:09:55,837
I thought we were like-minded.

1602
01:09:55,838 --> 01:10:00,008
It became clearer.

1603
01:10:00,538 --> 01:10:03,939
I had a lot of fun during our date.

1604
01:10:04,208 --> 01:10:05,208
Me too.

1605
01:10:05,979 --> 01:10:09,247
- What did the others do? - What did they do?

1606
01:10:09,248 --> 01:10:10,878
Everyone might come at 12am.

1607
01:10:11,079 --> 01:10:12,847
You're going out on a date tomorrow, right?

1608
01:10:12,848 --> 01:10:14,018
Yes.

1609
01:10:14,019 --> 01:10:15,788
Who are you going to choose?

1610
01:10:16,418 --> 01:10:19,128
Me? Well...

1611
01:10:20,088 --> 01:10:21,088
I'm curious.

1612
01:10:21,689 --> 01:10:25,258
I want to leave no regrets.

1613
01:10:25,559 --> 01:10:28,899
You want to leave no regrets.

1614
01:10:29,769 --> 01:10:32,568
- Someone else... - I have an idea.

1615
01:10:32,569 --> 01:10:34,207
It'd be fun if we go out...

1616
01:10:34,208 --> 01:10:36,538
with Yun Jae and Yun Ha.

1617
01:10:36,739 --> 01:10:40,248
Has their relationship become stable?

1618
01:10:41,208 --> 01:10:42,278
I don't know.

1619
01:10:42,279 --> 01:10:43,677
- Right. It could change. - I have no idea.

1620
01:10:43,678 --> 01:10:44,978
Yes. It might completely change.

1621
01:10:44,979 --> 01:10:46,819
They went out...

1622
01:10:46,888 --> 01:10:48,217
- with different people today. - Right.

1623
01:10:48,218 --> 01:10:49,258
No.

1624
01:10:51,258 --> 01:10:52,988
- No! - Stop!

1625
01:10:52,989 --> 01:10:54,359
Stop!

1626
01:10:54,888 --> 01:10:57,497
- I think I have good instincts. - Stop the drama!

1627
01:10:57,498 --> 01:11:00,627
When I talked to her on the first day,

1628
01:11:00,628 --> 01:11:03,137
I asked if there was anyone she hasn't talked with.

1629
01:11:03,138 --> 01:11:05,637
She said she hasn't talked with Yong Woo.

1630
01:11:05,638 --> 01:11:08,239
I asked if she regretted it.

1631
01:11:08,338 --> 01:11:10,978
"I don't have regrets for now."

1632
01:11:10,979 --> 01:11:13,149
So I was relieved.

1633
01:11:13,909 --> 01:11:16,818
- But eventually, they went out. - It became like this.

1634
01:11:16,819 --> 01:11:18,818
- It happened. - So...

1635
01:11:18,819 --> 01:11:20,218
No!

1636
01:11:20,918 --> 01:11:23,119
- Please! - Please!

1637
01:11:23,288 --> 01:11:24,688
Stop.

1638
01:11:24,689 --> 01:11:25,787
(The younger siblings are worried a lot.)

1639
01:11:25,788 --> 01:11:27,558
Yong Woo...

1640
01:11:27,559 --> 01:11:29,398
is fun, reliable,

1641
01:11:29,399 --> 01:11:30,757
and has a lot of experience.

1642
01:11:30,758 --> 01:11:33,568
But my brother...

1643
01:11:33,569 --> 01:11:36,998
would be sweeter to her, right?

1644
01:11:37,569 --> 01:11:38,638
I see.

1645
01:11:38,968 --> 01:11:40,568
Yong Woo is such a nice person.

1646
01:11:40,569 --> 01:11:41,768
Yes. He's nice.

1647
01:11:41,769 --> 01:11:43,908
But it feels like...

1648
01:11:43,909 --> 01:11:46,909
Unless they flirt like crazy...

1649
01:11:47,048 --> 01:11:49,378
"Unless they flirt like crazy."

1650
01:11:51,248 --> 01:11:54,218
Unless they're unbelievably flirty,

1651
01:11:54,888 --> 01:11:57,217
unless an unexpected event occurs...

1652
01:11:57,218 --> 01:11:59,159
Should we make an unexpected change?

1653
01:11:59,588 --> 01:12:01,558
How can we make an unexpected change?

1654
01:12:01,559 --> 01:12:03,329
We can't.

1655
01:12:03,859 --> 01:12:04,928
Why can't we?

1656
01:12:05,359 --> 01:12:09,138
Is there someone who can do that?

1657
01:12:10,038 --> 01:12:12,439
- It's so interesting. - I know.

1658
01:12:12,708 --> 01:12:15,168
- It's so fun. - It's so fun.

1659
01:12:19,149 --> 01:12:23,019
(Marina Barrage)

1660
01:12:23,418 --> 01:12:26,288
(If you go up along the walk,)

1661
01:12:30,189 --> 01:12:32,788
(you can see the open night view.)

1662
01:12:35,159 --> 01:12:38,029
(They're going on a picnic.)

1663
01:12:38,729 --> 01:12:40,997
It was in the back on the first day.

1664
01:12:40,998 --> 01:12:42,968
- Yes. - Is that the moon?

1665
01:12:43,138 --> 01:12:44,998
- Where? - Over there.

1666
01:12:48,838 --> 01:12:51,779
I've never seen the moon this close.

1667
01:12:54,279 --> 01:12:55,309
Look at the back.

1668
01:12:56,718 --> 01:12:57,718
Gosh.

1669
01:13:00,348 --> 01:13:01,418
It's amazing.

1670
01:13:02,348 --> 01:13:05,458
- Oh, my gosh. - It's wonderful, isn't it?

1671
01:13:06,159 --> 01:13:07,229
Oh, my.

1672
01:13:08,329 --> 01:13:11,258
- Sitting on a mat like this is... - Yes.

1673
01:13:11,998 --> 01:13:13,198
Having a budget of 100 dollars...

1674
01:13:13,199 --> 01:13:14,729
- is nice in its own way. - Yes.

1675
01:13:15,229 --> 01:13:17,967
Jung Sub and Ji Won had a budget of 50 dollars.

1676
01:13:17,968 --> 01:13:19,137
So they said they were going to ride a bicycle.

1677
01:13:19,138 --> 01:13:20,468
Right.

1678
01:13:20,809 --> 01:13:22,137
Did they ride a bicycle?

1679
01:13:22,138 --> 01:13:24,378
But it rained.

1680
01:13:25,079 --> 01:13:27,808
- I suddenly want to play music. - It's a good idea.

1681
01:13:27,809 --> 01:13:28,878
- It's good, right? - Yes.

1682
01:13:29,718 --> 01:13:31,578
- Is it nice when you lie down? - Yes, it's good.

1683
01:13:31,579 --> 01:13:32,588
Gosh.

1684
01:13:33,019 --> 01:13:34,489
Why are they not doing the tree show?

1685
01:13:35,088 --> 01:13:37,218
I think that's the show.

1686
01:13:37,989 --> 01:13:38,989
Oh, my.

1687
01:13:39,689 --> 01:13:41,189
You got up at the perfect time.

1688
01:13:41,489 --> 01:13:42,758
It started just a minute ago.

1689
01:13:43,598 --> 01:13:47,329
Tonight, we present the enchanted forest.

1690
01:13:47,699 --> 01:13:51,269
Grab your cameras and enjoy the show.

1691
01:13:59,708 --> 01:14:01,247
(Gardens by the Bay Supertree Show is held twice every evening,)

1692
01:14:01,248 --> 01:14:02,677
(creating a mystical atmosphere with lights and music.)

1693
01:14:02,678 --> 01:14:04,618
- Gosh. - Oh, my.

1694
01:14:04,619 --> 01:14:06,688
This is like "Avatar."

1695
01:14:06,689 --> 01:14:07,689
I know.

1696
01:14:07,690 --> 01:14:10,189
It's so pretty.

1697
01:14:11,758 --> 01:14:13,388
- Oh, my. - Oh, my.

1698
01:14:14,088 --> 01:14:15,587
- Gosh. - Gosh.

1699
01:14:15,588 --> 01:14:18,258
- It's so impressive. - It's so cool. Oh, my gosh.

1700
01:14:19,269 --> 01:14:21,468
- I play this every day. - You do?

1701
01:14:22,428 --> 01:14:25,637
With the orchestral piece of music I play often...

1702
01:14:25,638 --> 01:14:29,738
and beautiful lights moving around,

1703
01:14:29,739 --> 01:14:31,877
it was fantastic.

1704
01:14:31,878 --> 01:14:33,747
- I heard... - Yes.

1705
01:14:33,748 --> 01:14:36,648
it's best to enjoy while lying down.

1706
01:14:36,649 --> 01:14:38,548
- It sounds amazing. - Yes.

1707
01:14:38,649 --> 01:14:39,788
Yong Woo...

1708
01:14:40,119 --> 01:14:43,489
spread the shirt he prepared.

1709
01:14:43,888 --> 01:14:46,158
He prepared it.

1710
01:14:46,159 --> 01:14:47,787
I was so thankful.

1711
01:14:47,788 --> 01:14:49,358
I was touching, to be honest.

1712
01:14:49,359 --> 01:14:52,028
He was thoroughly prepared.

1713
01:14:52,029 --> 01:14:54,968
That's more romantic.

1714
01:14:55,399 --> 01:14:57,569
They're lying down together then?

1715
01:14:58,399 --> 01:14:59,838
This is bad.

1716
01:15:00,239 --> 01:15:01,739
This is getting worse.

1717
01:15:02,739 --> 01:15:03,809
What should we do with them?

1718
01:15:04,409 --> 01:15:06,547
- But it looks amazing. - It's so cool.

1719
01:15:06,548 --> 01:15:08,408
I want to go there. I'll go.

1720
01:15:08,409 --> 01:15:09,449
I should go to Singapore.

1721
01:15:10,418 --> 01:15:11,619
This is unbelievable.

1722
01:15:13,888 --> 01:15:15,548
Is this right?

1723
01:15:15,819 --> 01:15:16,989
- Sorry? - Is this how you do it?

1724
01:15:17,588 --> 01:15:19,018
Two, three, four.

1725
01:15:19,019 --> 01:15:20,428
Yes. This is how you do it.

1726
01:15:24,859 --> 01:15:26,899
The Supertree Show...

1727
01:15:27,399 --> 01:15:30,598
was just as impressive and beautiful...

1728
01:15:30,998 --> 01:15:32,497
as the flamingo...

1729
01:15:32,498 --> 01:15:35,508
from the day before.

1730
01:15:37,678 --> 01:15:39,948
It felt like the climax had begun.

1731
01:15:39,949 --> 01:15:41,347
It was perfect.

1732
01:15:41,348 --> 01:15:42,848
It was wonderful.

1733
01:15:43,348 --> 01:15:44,418
Gosh.

1734
01:15:46,348 --> 01:15:48,717
- Oh, my. - This is crazy.

1735
01:15:48,718 --> 01:15:51,388
This is insane.

1736
01:15:52,829 --> 01:15:53,858
Gosh.

1737
01:15:53,859 --> 01:15:55,489
- Oh, my. - Oh, my.

1738
01:15:55,758 --> 01:15:57,297
It really makes you say, "Oh, my."

1739
01:15:57,298 --> 01:16:00,029
- Amazing. - Amazing.

1740
01:16:01,928 --> 01:16:04,668
- That's Marina Bay. - Yes.

1741
01:16:05,098 --> 01:16:06,168
Gosh.

1742
01:16:07,269 --> 01:16:08,909
This is nice.

1743
01:16:13,409 --> 01:16:16,048
I think you're the type who has a lot of thoughts.

1744
01:16:16,149 --> 01:16:17,149
- Me? - Yes.

1745
01:16:17,150 --> 01:16:18,348
I don't have that many thoughts.

1746
01:16:21,718 --> 01:16:25,159
I'm quite simple too.

1747
01:16:26,458 --> 01:16:27,588
What was my first impression?

1748
01:16:29,229 --> 01:16:30,797
Oh, my gosh.

1749
01:16:30,798 --> 01:16:33,828
I have the same feelings I had...

1750
01:16:33,829 --> 01:16:35,167
in episode 2 or 3.

1751
01:16:35,168 --> 01:16:36,337
- Right. - Right.

1752
01:16:36,338 --> 01:16:37,868
- Is this allowed? - It's starting again.

1753
01:16:37,869 --> 01:16:40,438
It feels so weird to see them talking about things people say...

1754
01:16:40,439 --> 01:16:42,368
- when they start getting to know. - Yes. It's so weird.

1755
01:16:42,369 --> 01:16:45,338
It's like it's the beginning of the show...

1756
01:16:45,638 --> 01:16:46,748
when they met first.

1757
01:16:48,208 --> 01:16:49,548
What was my first impression?

1758
01:16:51,649 --> 01:16:54,018
You seemed very bright...

1759
01:16:54,019 --> 01:16:55,489
and energetic.

1760
01:16:55,788 --> 01:16:56,819
I see.

1761
01:16:57,088 --> 01:16:58,658
How about me?

1762
01:16:58,659 --> 01:17:00,627
I usually don't ask these questions to people.

1763
01:17:00,628 --> 01:17:02,658
- You don't? - No. So I don't really know.

1764
01:17:02,659 --> 01:17:04,198
- Most of the time... - You're not so curious about it.

1765
01:17:04,199 --> 01:17:06,127
No. I don't really ask questions like this.

1766
01:17:06,128 --> 01:17:07,998
"How was I today?"

1767
01:17:08,699 --> 01:17:10,269
You don't care about those things?

1768
01:17:10,439 --> 01:17:11,998
- Are you always confident? - I...

1769
01:17:13,909 --> 01:17:16,178
But you put it nicely.

1770
01:17:17,239 --> 01:17:19,338
- I rarely asked those questions. - Okay.

1771
01:17:19,479 --> 01:17:22,578
Then I heard people talking about me...

1772
01:17:22,579 --> 01:17:24,318
as I came here.

1773
01:17:24,319 --> 01:17:25,877
- How you see yourself... - Yes.

1774
01:17:25,878 --> 01:17:27,587
and how others see you are different.

1775
01:17:27,588 --> 01:17:29,488
Yes. It was the first time I got to hear about it.

1776
01:17:29,489 --> 01:17:30,558
- It must've felt new. - About their opinions on me.

1777
01:17:30,559 --> 01:17:32,319
- It must've been interesting. - Yes.

1778
01:17:33,088 --> 01:17:34,159
So what was my first impression?

1779
01:17:35,428 --> 01:17:36,498
You seemed...

1780
01:17:37,298 --> 01:17:38,758
very cool.

1781
01:17:39,029 --> 01:17:40,829
You left a good impression on me.

1782
01:17:40,928 --> 01:17:42,199
That's a relief.

1783
01:17:42,729 --> 01:17:43,797
It seemed you didn't care...

1784
01:17:43,798 --> 01:17:44,837
- about others' opinions. - Me?

1785
01:17:44,838 --> 01:17:46,337
Should I put it this way?

1786
01:17:46,338 --> 01:17:49,037
You didn't seem nervous.

1787
01:17:49,038 --> 01:17:51,507
That's what I felt.

1788
01:17:51,508 --> 01:17:53,648
You didn't look nervous.

1789
01:17:53,649 --> 01:17:56,319
I think I'm good at pretending to be like that.

1790
01:17:56,979 --> 01:17:59,449
- It left a positive impression. - I see.

1791
01:18:00,048 --> 01:18:02,188
If you think about it, first impressions are very important.

1792
01:18:02,189 --> 01:18:03,518
Because you have a feeling.

1793
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:05,287
- Right. You do. - You know...

1794
01:18:05,288 --> 01:18:06,528
if you'd be compatible or not.

1795
01:18:06,529 --> 01:18:09,529
I didn't know in the past because I didn't meet many people.

1796
01:18:09,758 --> 01:18:11,457
But now, I can kind of predict...

1797
01:18:11,458 --> 01:18:14,297
- the result. - Yes.

1798
01:18:14,298 --> 01:18:16,598
- You have a feeling, right? - Yes.

1799
01:18:16,739 --> 01:18:19,297
When it feels like we're not compatible,

1800
01:18:19,298 --> 01:18:21,239
I slowly close my mind.

1801
01:18:21,909 --> 01:18:23,609
My heart is open at first,

1802
01:18:23,838 --> 01:18:25,609
- but it closes later. - Yes.

1803
01:18:28,149 --> 01:18:30,877
It felt like she was saying it on purpose.

1804
01:18:30,878 --> 01:18:33,418
"When you're not compatible, you're not compatible."

1805
01:18:33,588 --> 01:18:37,119
It felt like a perfect prescription for me.

1806
01:18:37,588 --> 01:18:38,689
Today,

1807
01:18:40,189 --> 01:18:43,659
after reviewing a lot...

1808
01:18:45,199 --> 01:18:47,328
- with a different person, - Yes.

1809
01:18:47,329 --> 01:18:50,398
I have a lot of thoughts I didn't have before.

1810
01:18:50,399 --> 01:18:51,667
- You do? - Yes.

1811
01:18:51,668 --> 01:18:54,168
There were things I didn't see on purpose.

1812
01:18:54,508 --> 01:18:57,279
Now, it feels clearer.

1813
01:18:58,678 --> 01:19:00,178
What is clearer?

1814
01:19:01,479 --> 01:19:02,847
I'll give you some time to organize your thoughts.

1815
01:19:02,848 --> 01:19:04,819
Let me appreciate the moon.

1816
01:19:10,088 --> 01:19:13,189
I haven't gone out on a date with someone else...

1817
01:19:13,489 --> 01:19:15,529
- for a long time until today. - Yes.

1818
01:19:15,628 --> 01:19:18,028
The recent few days felt long to me.

1819
01:19:18,029 --> 01:19:20,869
It felt very long.

1820
01:19:20,998 --> 01:19:24,569
I went out on a date with someone else because I wanted to.

1821
01:19:25,538 --> 01:19:28,037
- When we came here earlier, - Yes.

1822
01:19:28,038 --> 01:19:29,238
I said I tried to cater to the other...

1823
01:19:29,239 --> 01:19:32,278
- even when we weren't compatible. - Yes.

1824
01:19:32,279 --> 01:19:33,948
I think this is the difference.

1825
01:19:33,949 --> 01:19:36,948
As time goes by,

1826
01:19:36,949 --> 01:19:40,188
I see both the parts that I like and find attractive about the person...

1827
01:19:40,189 --> 01:19:41,287
and the parts that don't match...

1828
01:19:41,288 --> 01:19:43,318
- my expectations. - Right.

1829
01:19:43,319 --> 01:19:44,858
So it's about if I focus on the attractive side...

1830
01:19:44,859 --> 01:19:46,957
or...

1831
01:19:46,958 --> 01:19:48,927
if I care more about the negative side.

1832
01:19:48,928 --> 01:19:52,329
I think I found the answer today.

1833
01:19:52,598 --> 01:19:54,297
- After talking with me? - Yes. After talking...

1834
01:19:54,298 --> 01:19:56,297
with a different person.

1835
01:19:56,298 --> 01:19:57,368
I guess...

1836
01:19:57,369 --> 01:20:00,468
- it opened your eyes to it. - Yes. It opened my eyes a little.

1837
01:20:00,708 --> 01:20:02,877
You might've not known that you were worried about it at that time.

1838
01:20:02,878 --> 01:20:06,177
- You just let it pass by. - Yes.

1839
01:20:06,178 --> 01:20:07,847
- You adapted to it. - Yes.

1840
01:20:07,848 --> 01:20:09,309
That's why you didn't know.

1841
01:20:09,479 --> 01:20:11,448
- It was something like that. - Right.

1842
01:20:11,449 --> 01:20:12,619
You really got me.

1843
01:20:13,619 --> 01:20:17,287
Should I say he's quite defensive...

1844
01:20:17,288 --> 01:20:19,828
about showing his feelings?

1845
01:20:19,829 --> 01:20:22,757
I thought we were similar in that sense.

1846
01:20:22,758 --> 01:20:25,898
He was thinking a lot.

1847
01:20:25,899 --> 01:20:28,898
I wondered what side of me...

1848
01:20:28,899 --> 01:20:31,238
made him think so much,

1849
01:20:31,239 --> 01:20:34,569
which made me have a lot of thoughts.

1850
01:20:38,038 --> 01:20:41,507
The clouds over there are moving fast.

1851
01:20:41,508 --> 01:20:42,508
Right.

1852
01:20:43,619 --> 01:20:46,418
- The wind is blowing. - Yes.

1853
01:20:48,119 --> 01:20:52,918
I thought it became a little hard to be in a good relationship...

1854
01:20:53,229 --> 01:20:56,628
before I came here.

1855
01:20:56,958 --> 01:20:59,899
Pure and romantic love.

1856
01:21:01,098 --> 01:21:05,537
"We can love each other..."

1857
01:21:05,538 --> 01:21:07,309
"just the way we are."

1858
01:21:07,508 --> 01:21:09,468
I think...

1859
01:21:09,638 --> 01:21:12,108
I want to have something like that.

1860
01:21:12,109 --> 01:21:14,579
I keep wanting things like that.

1861
01:21:15,279 --> 01:21:17,377
I want it more...

1862
01:21:17,378 --> 01:21:19,689
because of my ex-girlfriend.

1863
01:21:20,548 --> 01:21:23,788
At first,

1864
01:21:23,958 --> 01:21:28,029
my ex-girlfriend and Ji Won looked so similar.

1865
01:21:28,758 --> 01:21:31,199
So I became a little cautious.

1866
01:21:31,428 --> 01:21:32,859
I understand.

1867
01:21:33,029 --> 01:21:35,368
My ex said...

1868
01:21:35,369 --> 01:21:38,538
I wasn't her priority.

1869
01:21:42,638 --> 01:21:44,278
If I meet...

1870
01:21:44,279 --> 01:21:47,648
someone nice here...

1871
01:21:47,649 --> 01:21:51,047
and like her,

1872
01:21:51,048 --> 01:21:53,548
I want to experience...

1873
01:21:54,149 --> 01:21:56,519
a serious and valuable relationship.

1874
01:21:57,088 --> 01:21:59,618
That's why I said...

1875
01:21:59,619 --> 01:22:02,958
I was extremely careful...

1876
01:22:03,598 --> 01:22:07,199
about the final decision earlier.

1877
01:22:07,428 --> 01:22:08,898
I was very certain...

1878
01:22:08,899 --> 01:22:10,538
- about my feelings at first. - Yes.

1879
01:22:10,638 --> 01:22:12,967
So I didn't think...

1880
01:22:12,968 --> 01:22:17,138
of getting to know someone else.

1881
01:22:17,409 --> 01:22:20,308
Once I look at something, I go without looking at other things.

1882
01:22:20,309 --> 01:22:21,649
I go straight.

1883
01:22:21,779 --> 01:22:23,278
But I do wish...

1884
01:22:23,279 --> 01:22:27,048
that I had talked to other people back then.

1885
01:22:27,588 --> 01:22:28,918
- I see. - Yes.

1886
01:22:32,218 --> 01:22:33,858
The person you like versus...

1887
01:22:33,859 --> 01:22:37,128
the person who likes you. Who would you choose?

1888
01:22:37,229 --> 01:22:39,127
- The person I like. - Right?

1889
01:22:39,128 --> 01:22:41,098
- I'm like that too. - Right.

1890
01:22:41,329 --> 01:22:43,337
People say that those who are on...

1891
01:22:43,338 --> 01:22:45,939
the receiving end of love are happier.

1892
01:22:46,468 --> 01:22:49,468
I think that's what differentiates the two...

1893
01:22:50,038 --> 01:22:51,178
for me.

1894
01:22:52,338 --> 01:22:54,377
- I get what you mean. - Yes.

1895
01:22:54,378 --> 01:22:55,708
He... I mean, that person...

1896
01:22:56,848 --> 01:22:58,448
- is sweet and gentle... - Yes.

1897
01:22:58,449 --> 01:23:00,047
- and kind and treats you nicely. - Yes.

1898
01:23:00,048 --> 01:23:02,388
But he has a big ego.

1899
01:23:03,819 --> 01:23:06,358
I'm not sure who the one...

1900
01:23:06,359 --> 01:23:09,258
who's expressing his feelings toward you is, though.

1901
01:23:10,159 --> 01:23:12,598
It's either Yun Jae or Jung Sub.

1902
01:23:13,628 --> 01:23:14,968
Those are the only options.

1903
01:23:15,928 --> 01:23:18,038
What? Yun... Is it Jung Sub?

1904
01:23:20,638 --> 01:23:22,939
What made you feel that way?

1905
01:23:23,678 --> 01:23:24,739
He told me.

1906
01:23:25,178 --> 01:23:26,178
- He told you? - Yes.

1907
01:23:26,179 --> 01:23:27,409
Then it must be Yun Jae.

1908
01:23:28,208 --> 01:23:31,519
Why? Is Yun Jae the one who would actually say something?

1909
01:23:31,678 --> 01:23:33,417
No, it's just that Jung Sub...

1910
01:23:33,418 --> 01:23:35,119
has been sending messages to Se Seung the whole time.

1911
01:23:35,489 --> 01:23:37,619
Wait, what? Are there six guys?

1912
01:23:37,718 --> 01:23:39,258
I can't figure this out.

1913
01:23:41,388 --> 01:23:44,199
- Well... - So the two of you spoke?

1914
01:23:44,598 --> 01:23:46,159
- Yes. - Since we got here?

1915
01:23:46,928 --> 01:23:48,128
No, it was before we came here.

1916
01:23:49,668 --> 01:23:50,668
Really?

1917
01:23:51,439 --> 01:23:53,508
Wait, this is so confusing.

1918
01:23:55,809 --> 01:23:59,508
Well, anyway. That's just how I feel.

1919
01:24:01,208 --> 01:24:02,309
I was a bit surprised...

1920
01:24:02,909 --> 01:24:05,248
because I didn't expect that at all.

1921
01:24:05,878 --> 01:24:07,149
I was slightly shocked...

1922
01:24:07,848 --> 01:24:09,218
since what I heard was new to me.

1923
01:24:11,319 --> 01:24:13,258
Gosh. It's not over until it's over.

1924
01:24:15,458 --> 01:24:17,257
I feel like you could be the one...

1925
01:24:17,258 --> 01:24:19,228
whose feelings change within the next three days.

1926
01:24:19,229 --> 01:24:20,928
That's why I told you earlier...

1927
01:24:21,329 --> 01:24:23,398
because I feel like there could be people...

1928
01:24:23,399 --> 01:24:25,838
who make completely different decisions.

1929
01:24:28,638 --> 01:24:30,138
Wait, then...

1930
01:24:31,739 --> 01:24:35,579
But I'm not sure. But women have intuition.

1931
01:24:37,048 --> 01:24:38,218
Women's intuition.

1932
01:24:38,319 --> 01:24:42,519
- Yes. - I think that's very scary.

1933
01:24:42,918 --> 01:24:46,059
I really think that it's so scary.

1934
01:24:46,758 --> 01:24:50,258
A woman's hunch is very accurate.

1935
01:24:51,098 --> 01:24:53,298
It's right every time, not just most of the time.

1936
01:24:55,369 --> 01:24:58,739
That's why I feel like...

1937
01:25:00,409 --> 01:25:03,279
he's conflicted between me and someone else.

1938
01:25:08,579 --> 01:25:11,449
I think all you have to do...

1939
01:25:12,218 --> 01:25:15,519
give Ji Won assurance and it'll be okay.

1940
01:25:16,248 --> 01:25:17,519
- Ji Won? - Yes.

1941
01:25:18,059 --> 01:25:19,519
I don't confuse people.

1942
01:25:20,329 --> 01:25:21,529
- It seems like it. - Right.

1943
01:25:21,628 --> 01:25:24,698
I'm not sure myself,

1944
01:25:24,699 --> 01:25:25,958
which is why I don't know what to do.

1945
01:25:26,399 --> 01:25:28,297
I'm not the type to weigh my options...

1946
01:25:28,298 --> 01:25:29,369
once I am sure.

1947
01:25:30,869 --> 01:25:35,838
I really thought you two were clearly into each other.

1948
01:25:36,508 --> 01:25:38,739
But you're saying that might not be the case.

1949
01:25:38,838 --> 01:25:41,979
This is going to be quite interesting.

1950
01:25:43,048 --> 01:25:46,019
This is interesting all of a sudden.

1951
01:25:47,449 --> 01:25:48,449
Thank you.

1952
01:25:48,450 --> 01:25:49,888
(Jung Sub and Ji Won quickly returned to the house.)

1953
01:25:50,288 --> 01:25:52,087
- The house looks silent, - What?

1954
01:25:52,088 --> 01:25:53,628
- Jung Sub. It's silent. - I see.

1955
01:25:55,128 --> 01:25:57,829
It's very quiet here, right?

1956
01:25:58,859 --> 01:26:00,029
Let's go wash our hands.

1957
01:26:00,628 --> 01:26:02,297
The shrimp...

1958
01:26:02,298 --> 01:26:04,597
The shrimp probably still remains.

1959
01:26:04,598 --> 01:26:06,707
I'm going to wash my hands and change my clothes.

1960
01:26:06,708 --> 01:26:07,708
Sounds good.

1961
01:26:08,508 --> 01:26:10,877
Gosh, this is much better.

1962
01:26:10,878 --> 01:26:12,338
(Takes a seat)

1963
01:26:13,079 --> 01:26:15,708
- This is nice. - This is nice.

1964
01:26:16,579 --> 01:26:17,579
Cheers.

1965
01:26:17,779 --> 01:26:22,048
(They're finally drinking beer.)

1966
01:26:26,319 --> 01:26:27,388
That's good.

1967
01:26:28,529 --> 01:26:31,559
What was your favourite date so far?

1968
01:26:31,859 --> 01:26:33,927
Today was... The first date.

1969
01:26:33,928 --> 01:26:35,229
But that wasn't a date, though.

1970
01:26:35,569 --> 01:26:36,769
The first date?

1971
01:26:38,269 --> 01:26:40,569
- That was really... - I knew it.

1972
01:26:40,869 --> 01:26:43,138
What? What first one?

1973
01:26:43,439 --> 01:26:44,808
The first one. Your very first date.

1974
01:26:44,809 --> 01:26:47,378
My very first... No, I meant the first one here.

1975
01:26:47,678 --> 01:26:49,207
- That wasn't a date. Yes. - The first one here?

1976
01:26:49,208 --> 01:26:51,448
Are you talking about the date I went on with Yong Woo?

1977
01:26:51,449 --> 01:26:53,587
- Yes. - I see.

1978
01:26:53,588 --> 01:26:56,287
Because you chose him at first glance.

1979
01:26:56,288 --> 01:26:59,489
That means a lot.

1980
01:26:59,588 --> 01:27:02,828
That's why I said that nonsense about leading people on.

1981
01:27:02,829 --> 01:27:03,899
"Nonsense."

1982
01:27:06,128 --> 01:27:08,328
"I should talk to more people,"

1983
01:27:08,329 --> 01:27:09,869
was how I used to feel.

1984
01:27:09,968 --> 01:27:11,739
But that's when I started to think...

1985
01:27:11,939 --> 01:27:15,637
that could make some people feel uncomfortable,

1986
01:27:15,638 --> 01:27:17,408
- and... - Gosh, really?

1987
01:27:17,409 --> 01:27:18,708
I'm so sorry.

1988
01:27:18,809 --> 01:27:20,377
No, you don't have to be.

1989
01:27:20,378 --> 01:27:23,448
At the time, I did think that I made a mistake.

1990
01:27:23,449 --> 01:27:26,619
It's like I felt chills.

1991
01:27:27,119 --> 01:27:29,388
I was like, "That's not what I was trying to say."

1992
01:27:30,418 --> 01:27:31,957
There's no reason for you to be sorry...

1993
01:27:31,958 --> 01:27:34,288
because since Gangwon Province,

1994
01:27:34,388 --> 01:27:36,559
I became curious about Jae Hyung.

1995
01:27:36,758 --> 01:27:38,798
So I decided that...

1996
01:27:39,399 --> 01:27:42,399
that's who I should focus on.

1997
01:27:43,739 --> 01:27:44,739
Hi.

1998
01:27:44,740 --> 01:27:46,909
(Yun Ha and Yong Woo head home.)

1999
01:27:50,109 --> 01:27:51,678
Spending this time with you...

2000
01:27:52,008 --> 01:27:54,579
helped me process the dilemma I had this morning...

2001
01:27:55,008 --> 01:27:56,678
throughout the day.

2002
01:27:56,949 --> 01:27:58,079
And I think that's right.

2003
01:27:58,949 --> 01:28:00,988
- I've actually said it once. - Yes.

2004
01:28:00,989 --> 01:28:02,587
I once said that you're like the salt and light...

2005
01:28:02,588 --> 01:28:03,787
- of our group. - Me?

2006
01:28:03,788 --> 01:28:04,957
- Yes. - Gosh.

2007
01:28:04,958 --> 01:28:07,188
- That's so touching. - Seriously. Like we need you.

2008
01:28:07,189 --> 01:28:08,757
You made that analogy?

2009
01:28:08,758 --> 01:28:09,758
Yes.

2010
01:28:09,758 --> 01:28:10,758
She has a great personality.

2011
01:28:10,759 --> 01:28:13,529
She livens up the mood and responds really well.

2012
01:28:14,128 --> 01:28:16,597
So she's like the salt and light that we need...

2013
01:28:16,598 --> 01:28:17,869
within this group.

2014
01:28:18,838 --> 01:28:20,168
I could be wrong, though.

2015
01:28:21,269 --> 01:28:23,137
What do you mean? I was tearing up just now.

2016
01:28:23,138 --> 01:28:25,579
I said something along these lines.

2017
01:28:25,909 --> 01:28:28,047
If we're having this much fun,

2018
01:28:28,048 --> 01:28:30,449
you make the fun this big.

2019
01:28:30,918 --> 01:28:32,648
You really think I'm important...

2020
01:28:32,649 --> 01:28:34,149
He said I was important.

2021
01:28:34,489 --> 01:28:37,019
He thinks of me as an important person.

2022
01:28:37,689 --> 01:28:41,658
I was thankful. I was so moved...

2023
01:28:41,659 --> 01:28:44,958
that I almost cried at that moment. I choked up a bit.

2024
01:28:45,359 --> 01:28:49,229
But then he started talking about something else,

2025
01:28:49,369 --> 01:28:52,069
so I was just like, "I see."

2026
01:28:52,439 --> 01:28:54,667
I think I had a lot...

2027
01:28:54,668 --> 01:28:56,408
on my mind yesterday.

2028
01:28:56,409 --> 01:28:58,378
- Really? - I didn't even realize but I did.

2029
01:29:00,279 --> 01:29:03,048
I guess I need to practice thinking about these things.

2030
01:29:03,449 --> 01:29:04,479
You know why you're like that?

2031
01:29:04,519 --> 01:29:05,819
Because you've lived alone for a long time.

2032
01:29:06,319 --> 01:29:08,119
I've been living with my family this whole time.

2033
01:29:08,519 --> 01:29:09,747
- Still. When you were abroad... - When I was abroad.

2034
01:29:09,748 --> 01:29:11,258
I see.

2035
01:29:11,888 --> 01:29:14,159
And you just take care of things on your own.

2036
01:29:14,729 --> 01:29:17,428
It's become a habit. I'm kind of like that too.

2037
01:29:17,529 --> 01:29:19,029
- I think I'm like that too. - Yes.

2038
01:29:20,628 --> 01:29:22,369
This is the first time I've even thought of it.

2039
01:29:23,569 --> 01:29:25,569
That it's because I've lived alone for a long time.

2040
01:29:25,869 --> 01:29:28,138
- Stop. - You're right. That's crazy.

2041
01:29:28,239 --> 01:29:29,508
- Stop. - What are you?

2042
01:29:29,838 --> 01:29:31,239
Can you read minds?

2043
01:29:32,909 --> 01:29:34,148
I feel like we haven't been on a date until now...

2044
01:29:34,149 --> 01:29:35,848
so we could talk at this moment.

2045
01:29:35,979 --> 01:29:37,048
- Really? - Yes.

2046
01:29:37,119 --> 01:29:38,718
(Gosh)

2047
01:29:43,149 --> 01:29:44,418
Have you ever felt this way before?

2048
01:29:44,758 --> 01:29:46,189
This person is very similar to you.

2049
01:29:46,659 --> 01:29:47,989
So similar that...

2050
01:29:48,788 --> 01:29:51,159
you feel like you shouldn't be with them.

2051
01:29:51,258 --> 01:29:52,427
- Do you get what I mean? - Yes.

2052
01:29:52,428 --> 01:29:54,699
- I feel like you might. - Yes, I have.

2053
01:29:54,798 --> 01:29:57,069
I feel like the way we think is very similar,

2054
01:29:57,739 --> 01:29:59,598
and we're just the same from A to Z.

2055
01:30:00,909 --> 01:30:02,609
So for me, this could actually be...

2056
01:30:03,038 --> 01:30:04,279
- this... - Poison for you.

2057
01:30:04,378 --> 01:30:05,809
That's how I feel.

2058
01:30:06,138 --> 01:30:07,877
- That's why... - You could butt heads a lot.

2059
01:30:07,878 --> 01:30:09,909
- That's right. - Or like each other even more.

2060
01:30:11,048 --> 01:30:12,149
What are you?

2061
01:30:13,689 --> 01:30:16,619
But I feel like even if you may butt heads,

2062
01:30:16,718 --> 01:30:19,119
being similar is better. That's just me.

2063
01:30:21,989 --> 01:30:22,989
Right.

2064
01:30:26,059 --> 01:30:27,668
We're so similar...

2065
01:30:28,128 --> 01:30:31,439
that I feel like I've turned my back on her a few times...

2066
01:30:31,998 --> 01:30:33,167
thinking this won't work.

2067
01:30:33,168 --> 01:30:36,207
But why? What scared you that you turned your back on her?

2068
01:30:36,208 --> 01:30:37,808
It's not like I was scared.

2069
01:30:37,809 --> 01:30:40,948
I think she felt so similar to me...

2070
01:30:40,949 --> 01:30:43,579
that she started feeling less like someone I could date.

2071
01:30:44,178 --> 01:30:46,988
So it's not like you were reluctant.

2072
01:30:46,989 --> 01:30:49,218
It just naturally happened...

2073
01:30:49,588 --> 01:30:50,758
(Thinking)

2074
01:30:50,888 --> 01:30:52,258
because you're too similar.

2075
01:30:52,689 --> 01:30:54,787
That's something I should... You know?

2076
01:30:54,788 --> 01:30:57,158
- You should think about it. - I need some time to do that.

2077
01:30:57,159 --> 01:30:59,328
Yes. I'll give you time.

2078
01:30:59,329 --> 01:31:01,899
I'll just leave you alone.

2079
01:31:02,428 --> 01:31:06,569
He kept saying things I couldn't understand at all.

2080
01:31:06,668 --> 01:31:08,538
He would start saying something and then he'd stop all of a sudden.

2081
01:31:09,769 --> 01:31:12,538
So I look at him, and he's lost in thought.

2082
01:31:14,378 --> 01:31:16,918
"I see. He needs time to think."

2083
01:31:17,079 --> 01:31:18,079
"Go ahead. Think."

2084
01:31:18,979 --> 01:31:21,548
And I'd just stare out the window.

2085
01:31:22,019 --> 01:31:25,888
Yong Woo and I had a lot of incoherent conversations,

2086
01:31:26,418 --> 01:31:27,457
but it was nice.

2087
01:31:27,458 --> 01:31:30,958
So we had fun at that moment.

2088
01:31:31,958 --> 01:31:35,869
I do feel like there are times I feel very confused,

2089
01:31:36,269 --> 01:31:38,668
although I probably shouldn't.

2090
01:31:41,069 --> 01:31:43,637
It's always really unpredictable.

2091
01:31:43,638 --> 01:31:44,638
- Right. - Yes.

2092
01:31:45,479 --> 01:31:47,779
It's really unbelievable.

2093
01:31:52,218 --> 01:31:53,479
Are you crying?

2094
01:31:53,689 --> 01:31:56,119
I was just moved when you said "unbelievable."

2095
01:31:56,888 --> 01:32:00,019
So when did you go to China...

2096
01:32:00,329 --> 01:32:01,728
and for what?

2097
01:32:01,729 --> 01:32:02,989
After I completed my Master's,

2098
01:32:03,388 --> 01:32:06,098
I was the principal cello at an orchestra there.

2099
01:32:08,199 --> 01:32:09,729
That's an amazing career.

2100
01:32:09,829 --> 01:32:12,498
I just worked hard as if I was studying abroad.

2101
01:32:14,939 --> 01:32:16,439
I like Yun Jae because...

2102
01:32:16,538 --> 01:32:19,508
I can tell he's an easy-going person who studied abroad.

2103
01:32:20,779 --> 01:32:22,248
Why would you talk about that all of a sudden?

2104
01:32:22,779 --> 01:32:24,347
Since we were talking about studying abroad.

2105
01:32:24,348 --> 01:32:26,718
Yun Jae was abroad the longest with Ji Won.

2106
01:32:27,519 --> 01:32:29,217
In the hideout at night,

2107
01:32:29,218 --> 01:32:31,359
- a few of us meet up for drinks. - Right, I heard.

2108
01:32:31,458 --> 01:32:33,418
And the more I see Yun Jae, the more he seems like a good person.

2109
01:32:34,159 --> 01:32:36,458
I was just reminded of him all of a sudden.

2110
01:32:39,029 --> 01:32:42,329
So are you saying you're pushing Yun Jae away because you're similar?

2111
01:32:42,769 --> 01:32:43,769
What?

2112
01:32:44,098 --> 01:32:45,698
That's what you sounded like just now.

2113
01:32:45,699 --> 01:32:47,467
No. Wait, say that one more time.

2114
01:32:47,468 --> 01:32:49,438
You were attracted to Yun Jae because you were similar,

2115
01:32:49,439 --> 01:32:51,078
but you pushed him away?

2116
01:32:51,079 --> 01:32:53,949
So did I push Yun Jae away because...

2117
01:32:54,048 --> 01:32:55,248
I felt like we were too similar?

2118
01:32:55,348 --> 01:32:56,978
Isn't that what you were saying?

2119
01:32:56,979 --> 01:32:58,548
You're like a genius.

2120
01:32:59,149 --> 01:33:03,019
Only a genius would interpret what I said like that.

2121
01:33:04,319 --> 01:33:06,659
I can't seem to grasp the flow of your logic.

2122
01:33:07,029 --> 01:33:10,329
You're jumping from here to there.

2123
01:33:11,029 --> 01:33:13,428
In conclusion, thanks to you, I was able to look back at myself.

2124
01:33:14,329 --> 01:33:15,569
So thank you. That's it.

2125
01:33:16,769 --> 01:33:18,438
Yun Ha must have thought to herself, "What's wrong with him?"

2126
01:33:18,439 --> 01:33:21,338
But I was thinking about these things by myself in the car.

2127
01:33:21,638 --> 01:33:23,268
I couldn't really tell her everything,

2128
01:33:23,269 --> 01:33:25,208
so I was just thinking to myself.

2129
01:33:25,638 --> 01:33:27,848
I just understood the situation...

2130
01:33:28,149 --> 01:33:29,707
off of the things she said...

2131
01:33:29,708 --> 01:33:31,318
and how she responded to what I said.

2132
01:33:31,319 --> 01:33:32,548
I just organized my thoughts.

2133
01:33:33,319 --> 01:33:36,718
Well, you might have noticed,

2134
01:33:37,359 --> 01:33:40,729
but I was thinking about how I spent most of my time...

2135
01:33:40,989 --> 01:33:44,529
with just one person despite the opportunities that I was given.

2136
01:33:45,359 --> 01:33:47,668
But then, I was looking back,

2137
01:33:47,769 --> 01:33:49,968
thinking about who I talked to the most in Seoul,

2138
01:33:50,269 --> 01:33:51,698
who I spent the most time with,

2139
01:33:51,699 --> 01:33:53,038
who I had fun being around.

2140
01:33:53,399 --> 01:33:56,637
All of those things kind of hit me in the head,

2141
01:33:56,638 --> 01:33:57,678
now that I was thinking about it.

2142
01:33:58,538 --> 01:34:00,648
So I came to some kind of realization...

2143
01:34:00,649 --> 01:34:03,578
thinking, "Yes, that's right."

2144
01:34:03,579 --> 01:34:05,347
There must have been some parts...

2145
01:34:05,348 --> 01:34:07,788
that I had pushed aside and didn't realize.

2146
01:34:07,989 --> 01:34:11,958
Those thoughts came to me, perhaps a little too late.

2147
01:34:17,258 --> 01:34:19,998
I was thinking until the very last moment when we got out of the car.

2148
01:34:20,498 --> 01:34:23,127
So what I realized was that there are parts where we butt heads,

2149
01:34:23,128 --> 01:34:26,369
but it's not like either one of us is wrong. We're just different.

2150
01:34:27,069 --> 01:34:29,468
That's when I felt at ease and made up my mind.

2151
01:34:29,869 --> 01:34:34,278
I thought that now was a great time...

2152
01:34:34,279 --> 01:34:35,348
for me to speak with Cho A.

2153
01:34:41,848 --> 01:34:44,189
We dressed well today.

2154
01:34:44,388 --> 01:34:46,859
Yes, your outfit was amazing.

2155
01:34:49,359 --> 01:34:50,359
Anyone there?

2156
01:34:51,359 --> 01:34:52,528
- Is anyone there? - Yes.

2157
01:34:52,529 --> 01:34:54,068
- You're back. - Hi.

2158
01:34:54,069 --> 01:34:55,069
Hi.

2159
01:34:55,070 --> 01:34:57,167
We didn't have enough money,

2160
01:34:57,168 --> 01:34:58,667
- so we came back early... - You came back early.

2161
01:34:58,668 --> 01:34:59,938
- and we're eating food... - We didn't have money,

2162
01:34:59,939 --> 01:35:01,207
- that we had here. - so we're eating food here.

2163
01:35:01,208 --> 01:35:02,537
That's nice.

2164
01:35:02,538 --> 01:35:03,538
- Money is... - How was it?

2165
01:35:03,708 --> 01:35:05,378
Today was insane.

2166
01:35:05,479 --> 01:35:06,538
- Really? - Yes.

2167
01:35:06,838 --> 01:35:08,978
They're here to brag

2168
01:35:08,979 --> 01:35:10,008
Are you here to brag?

2169
01:35:11,418 --> 01:35:13,218
- Get out. - What?

2170
01:35:13,319 --> 01:35:15,118
- Get out. - Get out.

2171
01:35:15,119 --> 01:35:17,119
- I don't want to look at you. - That reminds me of Jung Sub.

2172
01:35:17,388 --> 01:35:19,819
- This is Jung Sub. - Yong Woo, your lats...

2173
01:35:19,888 --> 01:35:21,258
Do you know what I realized today?

2174
01:35:21,359 --> 01:35:22,529
I should work out my arms harder.

2175
01:35:24,729 --> 01:35:26,997
Yong Woo. You almost lost,

2176
01:35:26,998 --> 01:35:28,769
- you know that right? - I was so surprised earlier.

2177
01:35:29,128 --> 01:35:31,838
I couldn't move my wrists for a while once it was over.

2178
01:35:32,638 --> 01:35:34,869
Why did you buy these when you were broke?

2179
01:35:35,208 --> 01:35:38,609
- We weren't given mercy at all. - Really?

2180
01:35:38,708 --> 01:35:40,779
We couldn't even drink beer because we didn't have money.

2181
01:35:41,149 --> 01:35:43,109
I really considered panhandling.

2182
01:35:43,208 --> 01:35:45,019
- I like your outfit today. - I see.

2183
01:35:45,579 --> 01:35:48,489
We're like the rebellion of the youngest.

2184
01:35:49,218 --> 01:35:50,887
You two are on the floor and we're on the couch.

2185
01:35:50,888 --> 01:35:51,957
The rebellion of the youngest.

2186
01:35:51,958 --> 01:35:54,457
We're actually more comfortable on the floor.

2187
01:35:54,458 --> 01:35:55,458
That's right.

2188
01:35:56,689 --> 01:35:58,699
Were you born in the Joseon Dynasty?

2189
01:36:01,199 --> 01:36:03,868
You're not a pilot from the Joseon Dynasty, are you?

2190
01:36:03,869 --> 01:36:06,269
(He passed the pilot's state exam in the Joseon Dynasty.)

2191
01:36:06,569 --> 01:36:09,868
She was practically like Dr. Oh Eun Yeong today.

2192
01:36:09,869 --> 01:36:10,877
- What do you mean? - Really?

2193
01:36:10,878 --> 01:36:12,278
Did you have a therapy session?

2194
01:36:12,279 --> 01:36:13,609
She really heard me out.

2195
01:36:13,708 --> 01:36:15,478
I didn't expect to open up...

2196
01:36:15,479 --> 01:36:17,008
and talk to her the way that I did.

2197
01:36:17,079 --> 01:36:19,547
You're kind of dressed like a shaman today too.

2198
01:36:19,548 --> 01:36:20,949
"Tell me, child."

2199
01:36:21,619 --> 01:36:24,088
- Tell me. - Tell me what's on your mind.

2200
01:36:24,189 --> 01:36:25,818
(Ju Yeon and Yun Jae are back.)

2201
01:36:25,819 --> 01:36:28,159
I'm going to keep it safe.

2202
01:36:28,428 --> 01:36:30,488
- Welcome. - What?

2203
01:36:30,489 --> 01:36:31,497
You came back early?

2204
01:36:31,498 --> 01:36:32,498
Yes, we came back early.

2205
01:36:32,499 --> 01:36:33,998
Se Seung must be having the time of her life.

2206
01:36:34,098 --> 01:36:35,098
This is Ju Yeon's.

2207
01:36:35,098 --> 01:36:36,098
I thought you said "kissing."

2208
01:36:36,099 --> 01:36:37,798
- I thought you said "kissing" too. - "Se Seung must be kissing."

2209
01:36:38,439 --> 01:36:40,238
- Hello, everyone. - Hello.

2210
01:36:40,239 --> 01:36:41,968
- Gosh, you look so pretty. - Gosh.

2211
01:36:42,269 --> 01:36:43,308
You look so pretty.

2212
01:36:43,309 --> 01:36:44,909
Was that your outfit when you left?

2213
01:36:45,008 --> 01:36:46,738
- It's so nice. - I was so curious about...

2214
01:36:46,739 --> 01:36:48,608
what you did today.

2215
01:36:48,609 --> 01:36:51,449
Me? Us? We're hungry right now.

2216
01:36:52,579 --> 01:36:54,148
The bikes were 15 dollars.

2217
01:36:54,149 --> 01:36:56,547
- That's expensive. - So we had 35 dollars left.

2218
01:36:56,548 --> 01:36:58,218
And then we were so hungry...

2219
01:36:58,918 --> 01:37:00,689
that we started frothing at the mouth.

2220
01:37:01,729 --> 01:37:04,257
Sir, your order of soju is here.

2221
01:37:04,258 --> 01:37:06,559
- Goodness. Thank you. - Gosh.

2222
01:37:06,659 --> 01:37:07,768
- I saw the table... - And...

2223
01:37:07,769 --> 01:37:09,898
fried fish. It was a combination of the four.

2224
01:37:09,899 --> 01:37:10,998
That must have been delicious.

2225
01:37:12,138 --> 01:37:14,508
You went to the beach.

2226
01:37:16,338 --> 01:37:21,048
(Ju Yeon and Yun Jae, Sentosa)

2227
01:37:21,208 --> 01:37:24,048
- But I... - You went to Sentosa.

2228
01:37:24,119 --> 01:37:25,418
We went here and there.

2229
01:37:25,949 --> 01:37:27,149
The place we went to yesterday.

2230
01:37:27,949 --> 01:37:29,819
At night, we went here.

2231
01:37:31,258 --> 01:37:32,718
I want to see that picture too.

2232
01:37:34,928 --> 01:37:37,428
Gosh, the vibes are great in this picture.

2233
01:37:37,529 --> 01:37:38,559
Let me see.

2234
01:37:39,029 --> 01:37:40,798
What? You look like newlyweds.

2235
01:37:41,369 --> 01:37:43,028
You look like newlyweds who live in Pangyo New Town.

2236
01:37:43,029 --> 01:37:44,037
Pangyo New Town.

2237
01:37:44,038 --> 01:37:45,738
That's where I got the tetanus shot.

2238
01:37:45,739 --> 01:37:46,769
Right, I'm sorry.

2239
01:37:47,439 --> 01:37:49,909
(Cho A and Jae Hyung are on their way back to the house.)

2240
01:37:50,008 --> 01:37:51,479
About what the others are saying.

2241
01:37:52,609 --> 01:37:53,739
- You're curious? - It's driving me insane.

2242
01:37:54,178 --> 01:37:55,678
I'm curious too.

2243
01:37:56,309 --> 01:37:58,019
I wonder how their dates went.

2244
01:37:58,479 --> 01:38:00,278
They must have sides to them...

2245
01:38:00,279 --> 01:38:02,689
that are different than what we see when we're all together.

2246
01:38:03,348 --> 01:38:04,888
I, myself, am very different.

2247
01:38:05,489 --> 01:38:07,159
I heard that from both of them.

2248
01:38:07,258 --> 01:38:08,388
I see.

2249
01:38:09,128 --> 01:38:11,229
- You've been on a date with him... - Of course.

2250
01:38:11,628 --> 01:38:12,628
- already. - Yes.

2251
01:38:12,629 --> 01:38:15,798
That must have been a good experience.

2252
01:38:15,899 --> 01:38:17,998
I was very surprised.

2253
01:38:18,538 --> 01:38:20,239
- That's when you talked. - Yes.

2254
01:38:20,739 --> 01:38:24,838
So like... How deep was it?

2255
01:38:26,479 --> 01:38:30,309
Enough for me to want to avoid talking about it.

2256
01:38:32,819 --> 01:38:33,918
Really?

2257
01:38:34,788 --> 01:38:36,418
Yes. So I think...

2258
01:38:36,918 --> 01:38:40,418
my heart was heavy at the time.

2259
01:38:40,659 --> 01:38:43,189
(Cho A and Jung Sub's date in Gangwon Province)

2260
01:38:43,729 --> 01:38:46,228
(I really like the smile you show me...)

2261
01:38:46,229 --> 01:38:48,229
(when our eyes briefly meet.)

2262
01:38:48,498 --> 01:38:50,998
(I don't really want to give up.)

2263
01:38:52,838 --> 01:38:55,609
(The honest and direct way Jung Sub expressed his feelings...)

2264
01:38:56,468 --> 01:38:58,239
- Jung Sub. - Yes.

2265
01:38:58,708 --> 01:39:04,079
(had made Cho A feel uncomfortable.)

2266
01:39:04,918 --> 01:39:08,689
Back then, my feelings were already...

2267
01:39:08,788 --> 01:39:11,689
noticeably leaning toward one person,

2268
01:39:11,788 --> 01:39:15,359
so my actions made that very clear.

2269
01:39:15,729 --> 01:39:19,698
I think he was kind of hurt by that,

2270
01:39:19,699 --> 01:39:20,828
the way I saw it.

2271
01:39:20,829 --> 01:39:22,529
After some time passed,

2272
01:39:22,869 --> 01:39:25,438
I started feeling bad about it.

2273
01:39:25,439 --> 01:39:26,638
The way I understood it was...

2274
01:39:27,069 --> 01:39:31,037
that she was telling me the reason why her feelings toward...

2275
01:39:31,038 --> 01:39:32,609
one person was wavering.

2276
01:39:32,708 --> 01:39:35,978
There's only one person she has feelings for right now.

2277
01:39:35,979 --> 01:39:37,279
And that would be Yong Woo.

2278
01:39:37,819 --> 01:39:39,278
But I think she's aware of it, herself.

2279
01:39:39,279 --> 01:39:40,988
Choosing the other person...

2280
01:39:40,989 --> 01:39:42,748
wouldn't be because she wants to date him.

2281
01:39:43,748 --> 01:39:48,627
The next three days are about to be difficult for everyone, then.

2282
01:39:48,628 --> 01:39:50,127
From my perspective,

2283
01:39:50,128 --> 01:39:53,598
there are so many things that are new to me.

2284
01:39:54,529 --> 01:39:56,497
Both Yong Woo and Jung Sub...

2285
01:39:56,498 --> 01:39:58,239
seemed to be sure about their feelings.

2286
01:39:58,598 --> 01:40:01,939
But everything's complicated now.

2287
01:40:03,508 --> 01:40:06,238
It's like, they seemed like...

2288
01:40:06,239 --> 01:40:09,208
they were placid because they were sure.

2289
01:40:09,508 --> 01:40:11,718
But on the inside,

2290
01:40:13,178 --> 01:40:15,019
there was a storm brewing.

2291
01:40:16,449 --> 01:40:18,359
I wonder what's going to happen and how.

2292
01:40:18,918 --> 01:40:20,588
I really can't predict anything.

2293
01:40:20,989 --> 01:40:22,688
I used to have an idea, but now...

2294
01:40:22,689 --> 01:40:24,528
Me too. I thought I was the only one who wasn't sure.

2295
01:40:24,529 --> 01:40:26,928
I thought I was the only one who was confused.

2296
01:40:27,928 --> 01:40:29,269
But everything's messed up now.

2297
01:40:30,029 --> 01:40:31,738
(Cho A and Jae Hyung are back.)

2298
01:40:31,739 --> 01:40:32,739
Thank you.

2299
01:40:33,439 --> 01:40:35,568
- I had fun. - Yes. Talking to you...

2300
01:40:35,569 --> 01:40:37,809
helped me organize my thoughts...

2301
01:40:39,138 --> 01:40:40,138
and it was fun.

2302
01:40:44,678 --> 01:40:45,748
They're in here.

2303
01:40:46,019 --> 01:40:47,118
- They're in there? - Hi.

2304
01:40:47,119 --> 01:40:48,888
- You're back. - Hi, hello.

2305
01:40:49,218 --> 01:40:51,458
- I see you had a lot to drink. - Yes, I did.

2306
01:40:52,159 --> 01:40:53,519
We didn't get to have dinner.

2307
01:40:53,619 --> 01:40:55,358
Really? We didn't...

2308
01:40:55,359 --> 01:40:57,358
have a lot of money to eat either.

2309
01:40:57,359 --> 01:40:59,828
That's why you shouldn't have lost.

2310
01:40:59,829 --> 01:41:00,899
We bought the most things.

2311
01:41:02,529 --> 01:41:04,738
We had the least amount of money but we still bought the most things.

2312
01:41:04,739 --> 01:41:05,769
What did you buy?

2313
01:41:08,168 --> 01:41:09,268
Did you ride the bike?

2314
01:41:09,269 --> 01:41:11,138
Yes. The bike.

2315
01:41:11,479 --> 01:41:13,507
- It was more like a rickshaw. - A rickshaw.

2316
01:41:13,508 --> 01:41:15,148
- Duck boat. - You won't be able to see our feet.

2317
01:41:15,149 --> 01:41:18,019
It's very visible, though.

2318
01:41:18,119 --> 01:41:20,678
Okay.

2319
01:41:21,218 --> 01:41:23,218
The reaction I expected from Jae Hyung was...

2320
01:41:23,588 --> 01:41:26,387
"Really? We were fourth place too, so..."

2321
01:41:26,388 --> 01:41:29,457
"we weren't able to do this and that."

2322
01:41:29,458 --> 01:41:31,797
But instead he said, "That's why you shouldn't have lost."

2323
01:41:31,798 --> 01:41:34,798
So I was a bit taken aback and hurt.

2324
01:41:37,098 --> 01:41:38,598
All right.

2325
01:41:40,968 --> 01:41:41,968
- I don't think it's me. - Then...

2326
01:41:41,969 --> 01:41:44,038
- it's probably about tomorrow. - It's the two of them.

2327
01:41:45,678 --> 01:41:47,377
Should we all head downstairs...

2328
01:41:47,378 --> 01:41:48,649
- Let's go downstairs. - together? Okay.

2329
01:41:49,449 --> 01:41:52,018
(Se Seung and Cheol Hyeon at Mandarin Oriental)

2330
01:41:52,019 --> 01:41:53,949
Let's go swimming.

2331
01:41:56,848 --> 01:41:58,519
(Gosh)

2332
01:41:59,059 --> 01:42:00,319
- Gosh. - Really?

2333
01:42:01,829 --> 01:42:03,928
- They're going for a swim? - They look so happy.

2334
01:42:04,029 --> 01:42:05,457
- Gosh. - They get to go swimming too?

2335
01:42:05,458 --> 01:42:06,899
They're really spending the day as rich people.

2336
01:42:06,998 --> 01:42:09,269
It must be so nice.

2337
01:42:09,498 --> 01:42:11,997
The pool is 1.2m deep. How tall are you?

2338
01:42:11,998 --> 01:42:13,498
I'm 1.64m tall.

2339
01:42:23,279 --> 01:42:26,548
It's cold. It's so cold.

2340
01:42:43,069 --> 01:42:45,038
Here.

2341
01:42:46,739 --> 01:42:48,668
- I want to dunk you. Yes. - Me?

2342
01:42:49,208 --> 01:42:50,708
- Go ahead and try. - Push you down.

2343
01:42:50,869 --> 01:42:51,878
Go ahead and try.

2344
01:42:57,449 --> 01:43:01,788
Se Seung and I played around,

2345
01:43:01,949 --> 01:43:03,588
and the vibes were great.

2346
01:43:14,329 --> 01:43:17,638
I can't say it didn't affect how I feel in any way.

2347
01:43:22,769 --> 01:43:24,108
But I wasn't sure if I should send...

2348
01:43:24,109 --> 01:43:27,538
Se Seung a message once today's date was over.

2349
01:43:28,748 --> 01:43:31,218
I had such a great time from start to finish.

2350
01:43:34,218 --> 01:43:37,218
You're getting water on me.

2351
01:43:37,418 --> 01:43:40,019
Gosh, that feels great.

2352
01:43:40,359 --> 01:43:41,758
That night view is...

2353
01:43:42,288 --> 01:43:43,788
The vibes are there.

2354
01:43:43,888 --> 01:43:47,329
I like seeing Cheol Hyeon...

2355
01:43:47,529 --> 01:43:48,797
be confident like that.

2356
01:43:48,798 --> 01:43:50,369
- He hasn't been this way before. - Right.

2357
01:43:58,109 --> 01:44:01,409
The hotel pool was so romantic.

2358
01:44:01,649 --> 01:44:04,279
The scenery was beautiful, we could even see the moon.

2359
01:44:05,519 --> 01:44:07,649
Gosh, Cheol Hyeon. Look, the moon.

2360
01:44:21,269 --> 01:44:22,298
Breathe.

2361
01:44:23,329 --> 01:44:24,329
No, breathe.

2362
01:44:24,330 --> 01:44:25,968
- Relax? - Yes, relax.

2363
01:44:27,598 --> 01:44:28,638
I was going to hold you up.

2364
01:44:33,779 --> 01:44:35,279
Your lips are blue.

2365
01:44:36,979 --> 01:44:37,979
They are?

2366
01:44:38,218 --> 01:44:39,378
I'm not cold, though.

2367
01:44:51,159 --> 01:44:52,199
Are you having fun?

2368
01:44:58,038 --> 01:44:59,597
I feel like water must have gone up your nose.

2369
01:44:59,598 --> 01:45:01,869
Totally. It feels like I had wasabi.

2370
01:45:03,309 --> 01:45:05,638
- When we go to the pool... - Will you teach me?

2371
01:45:06,678 --> 01:45:07,708
That was fun.

2372
01:45:08,248 --> 01:45:09,248
That was fun.

2373
01:45:11,248 --> 01:45:12,878
I'm craving some ramyeon.

2374
01:45:21,428 --> 01:45:23,228
- I feel fresh. - I'm happy.

2375
01:45:23,229 --> 01:45:24,258
- Right? - Yes.

2376
01:45:32,369 --> 01:45:33,498
Money is scary.

2377
01:45:36,008 --> 01:45:38,207
This is why we have to work hard to make money.

2378
01:45:38,208 --> 01:45:39,608
I'm going to live diligently from now on.

2379
01:45:39,609 --> 01:45:42,409
Money can buy you all types of emotions.

2380
01:45:42,649 --> 01:45:44,278
- I mean, - Money is...

2381
01:45:44,279 --> 01:45:45,279
who says you can't buy happiness with money?

2382
01:45:45,449 --> 01:45:48,788
Right. They bought love with money.

2383
01:45:50,949 --> 01:45:54,559
No. I still have faith in that.

2384
01:45:55,059 --> 01:45:56,128
No.

2385
01:45:56,329 --> 01:45:58,097
Let's work hard, everyone.

2386
01:45:58,098 --> 01:45:59,298
We have to live diligently.

2387
01:45:59,958 --> 01:46:02,097
- After you. - Shall I get in first?

2388
01:46:02,098 --> 01:46:03,098
(They head home.)

2389
01:46:03,869 --> 01:46:06,239
Time passes so quickly.

2390
01:46:07,069 --> 01:46:08,208
Is there anything you regret?

2391
01:46:08,439 --> 01:46:09,739
- Anything I regret? - Yes.

2392
01:46:10,208 --> 01:46:12,538
There is nothing I regret. But there is some disappointment.

2393
01:46:13,008 --> 01:46:14,909
I wasn't like this in the past.

2394
01:46:15,008 --> 01:46:16,708
If I have a good memory,

2395
01:46:17,279 --> 01:46:20,348
it makes me thoughtful.

2396
01:46:20,649 --> 01:46:22,718
I think to myself, "Why was it like that?"

2397
01:46:24,888 --> 01:46:25,888
Let's get some sleep.

2398
01:46:26,319 --> 01:46:28,359
Shall we get some sleep? Let's do that.

2399
01:46:28,928 --> 01:46:30,388
Let's sleep for ten minutes until we reach home.

2400
01:46:38,638 --> 01:46:41,769
(Se Seung can't fall asleep.)

2401
01:46:47,038 --> 01:46:48,148
Oh, my gosh.

2402
01:46:48,149 --> 01:46:50,247
- Oh, my gosh. - My goodness.

2403
01:46:50,248 --> 01:46:51,377
- Look at that. - This is insane.

2404
01:46:51,378 --> 01:46:53,217
- Stop. - That facial expression...

2405
01:46:53,218 --> 01:46:54,518
It's a deja vu.

2406
01:46:54,519 --> 01:46:55,717
- I thought... - The way she looks at Jung Sub.

2407
01:46:55,718 --> 01:46:58,018
I thought she only made that face when she looked at Jung Sub.

2408
01:46:58,019 --> 01:46:59,618
- Seriously. - It was like that.

2409
01:46:59,619 --> 01:47:00,718
What is going through her mind?

2410
01:47:00,819 --> 01:47:02,457
She is confused about her emotions.

2411
01:47:02,458 --> 01:47:04,257
She thinks the current situation...

2412
01:47:04,258 --> 01:47:05,957
is wrong, but...

2413
01:47:05,958 --> 01:47:07,728
Doesn't it seem like she is thinking about Jung Sub?

2414
01:47:07,729 --> 01:47:09,127
- She is thinking about him. - She probably feels bad too.

2415
01:47:09,128 --> 01:47:11,238
She really liked today's date.

2416
01:47:11,239 --> 01:47:13,398
- Really? - Yes, that might be the case.

2417
01:47:13,399 --> 01:47:14,438
Let's keep watching.

2418
01:47:14,439 --> 01:47:15,967
- There is a chance... - Let's keep watching.

2419
01:47:15,968 --> 01:47:17,108
- we are confused. - Okay.

2420
01:47:17,109 --> 01:47:18,109
Let's keep watching.

2421
01:47:38,998 --> 01:47:40,359
This is driving me crazy.

2422
01:47:51,338 --> 01:47:53,178
- Is everyone back? - What?

2423
01:47:53,508 --> 01:47:54,708
Is everyone back?

2424
01:47:56,678 --> 01:47:59,949
(Yong Woo is sitting at the terrace.)

2425
01:48:01,918 --> 01:48:04,418
- Why aren't you eating? - This place is nice.

2426
01:48:04,519 --> 01:48:05,688
Yes, it's nice.

2427
01:48:05,689 --> 01:48:07,519
It's pretty. Shall I take a photo of you?

2428
01:48:09,928 --> 01:48:12,498
It's pretty. The lights were off yesterday.

2429
01:48:13,229 --> 01:48:14,258
I know.

2430
01:48:15,498 --> 01:48:16,998
Did rain come in?

2431
01:48:21,668 --> 01:48:23,038
Cho A, I have something to say.

2432
01:48:23,138 --> 01:48:24,338
- What? - I have something to say.

2433
01:48:24,538 --> 01:48:25,538
- To me? - Yes.

2434
01:48:26,878 --> 01:48:29,248
- What is it about? - Sit down for a second.

2435
01:48:32,119 --> 01:48:33,418
What is it about?

2436
01:48:34,319 --> 01:48:36,148
- What do you think it's about? - What?

2437
01:48:36,149 --> 01:48:37,388
It's something very serious.

2438
01:48:38,859 --> 01:48:40,288
What is it about?

2439
01:48:41,529 --> 01:48:43,457
After my feet got better today,

2440
01:48:43,458 --> 01:48:45,158
- I walked around. - Yes.

2441
01:48:45,159 --> 01:48:46,257
I felt grateful for yesterday.

2442
01:48:46,258 --> 01:48:49,268
It was a precious day,

2443
01:48:49,269 --> 01:48:50,729
but you looked after me by my side.

2444
01:48:52,869 --> 01:48:54,239
I wanted to thank you.

2445
01:48:54,869 --> 01:48:56,038
I see.

2446
01:48:57,508 --> 01:49:01,238
And if we think about it,

2447
01:49:01,239 --> 01:49:05,779
we kept choosing each other for the dates...

2448
01:49:06,178 --> 01:49:07,819
after one point.

2449
01:49:08,248 --> 01:49:11,248
Today, I went on a date with someone else.

2450
01:49:12,519 --> 01:49:15,559
It was refreshing in a way.

2451
01:49:16,529 --> 01:49:17,859
I don't know if it was the same for you.

2452
01:49:18,598 --> 01:49:20,729
And... How should I put it?

2453
01:49:24,628 --> 01:49:26,497
Do you remember what we talked about in the car?

2454
01:49:26,498 --> 01:49:27,498
Yes.

2455
01:49:27,499 --> 01:49:31,378
Since there was someone I held dear to my heart,

2456
01:49:31,838 --> 01:49:34,909
I wanted to live by her words...

2457
01:49:35,649 --> 01:49:37,848
even though it wasn't my style.

2458
01:49:38,218 --> 01:49:39,218
I wanted to do that.

2459
01:49:39,848 --> 01:49:44,288
I made an effort to do that...

2460
01:49:44,718 --> 01:49:46,159
in the past days.

2461
01:49:48,128 --> 01:49:50,388
But I think it didn't suit me in some ways.

2462
01:49:51,128 --> 01:49:52,958
I didn't know that at the time.

2463
01:49:54,329 --> 01:49:55,628
After living in the first-person point of view,

2464
01:49:55,968 --> 01:49:58,838
I took on the third-person point of view.

2465
01:49:58,939 --> 01:50:02,238
Had it been my usual self, I would have jumped into action...

2466
01:50:02,239 --> 01:50:03,609
without saying something like this.

2467
01:50:04,038 --> 01:50:05,538
But you know me now.

2468
01:50:06,109 --> 01:50:08,377
So I thought to have a conversation with you...

2469
01:50:08,378 --> 01:50:10,008
on my way here.

2470
01:50:11,309 --> 01:50:15,288
I think honesty is the best solution.

2471
01:50:15,949 --> 01:50:18,318
After having these thoughts,

2472
01:50:18,319 --> 01:50:20,258
I realized that I should relay them to you.

2473
01:50:22,458 --> 01:50:24,189
I wanted to have a conversation too.

2474
01:50:24,288 --> 01:50:25,298
Is that so?

2475
01:50:34,668 --> 01:50:37,008
At first, I was a bit surprised.

2476
01:50:38,779 --> 01:50:40,178
Like a fool,

2477
01:50:40,538 --> 01:50:42,449
I thought he would say something nice.

2478
01:50:42,548 --> 01:50:44,748
I expected him to go, "I had a date today, but..."

2479
01:50:44,848 --> 01:50:49,548
I sat down expecting him to say something nice.

2480
01:50:51,019 --> 01:50:54,218
So the effect was greater.

2481
01:50:58,359 --> 01:51:00,229
To be honest, I had this thought too.

2482
01:51:00,699 --> 01:51:02,829
This is precious time,

2483
01:51:02,928 --> 01:51:05,369
but you couldn't even have a meal because of me.

2484
01:51:05,769 --> 01:51:07,298
You did that for me,

2485
01:51:07,998 --> 01:51:11,038
so I hated myself for having such thoughts.

2486
01:51:12,479 --> 01:51:14,638
I felt like I shouldn't do that.

2487
01:51:15,678 --> 01:51:17,247
But that's my honest thought too.

2488
01:51:17,248 --> 01:51:18,248
Yes.

2489
01:51:18,249 --> 01:51:21,449
So I wanted to tell you about this side of me too.

2490
01:51:27,189 --> 01:51:30,457
I thought about the ways...

2491
01:51:30,458 --> 01:51:32,097
I could sugarcoat the words, but that wouldn't be right.

2492
01:51:32,098 --> 01:51:35,468
- I think honesty is the best. - That's right.

2493
01:51:36,968 --> 01:51:38,369
I am not talking about a parting.

2494
01:51:38,468 --> 01:51:39,667
A meeting is very important.

2495
01:51:39,668 --> 01:51:41,297
I think it's important...

2496
01:51:41,298 --> 01:51:43,068
to talk about these things.

2497
01:51:43,069 --> 01:51:44,568
I don't understand what he is talking about.

2498
01:51:44,569 --> 01:51:45,838
He isn't being honest.

2499
01:51:45,939 --> 01:51:47,537
- I know. - He is pretending to be honest.

2500
01:51:47,538 --> 01:51:50,408
He isn't the type to have a way with words.

2501
01:51:50,409 --> 01:51:52,747
When you talk, what's important isn't the words that come out.

2502
01:51:52,748 --> 01:51:53,847
What's important is...

2503
01:51:53,848 --> 01:51:55,747
how the other person understands those words.

2504
01:51:55,748 --> 01:51:56,888
He doesn't have a way with words.

2505
01:51:57,388 --> 01:51:59,788
It must be very difficult for Cho A.

2506
01:51:59,989 --> 01:52:01,018
I don't think she understood.

2507
01:52:01,019 --> 01:52:02,528
- He is confusing her. - Yes.

2508
01:52:02,529 --> 01:52:03,529
His words are hard to decipher.

2509
01:52:03,530 --> 01:52:05,497
Why does he keep making her think alone?

2510
01:52:05,498 --> 01:52:07,559
It's like, "What is he getting at?"

2511
01:52:08,329 --> 01:52:09,728
I am not talking about a parting.

2512
01:52:09,729 --> 01:52:10,997
A meeting is very important.

2513
01:52:10,998 --> 01:52:12,698
I think it's important...

2514
01:52:12,699 --> 01:52:14,399
to talk about these things.

2515
01:52:15,869 --> 01:52:18,508
- So... - At first, I was like,

2516
01:52:18,838 --> 01:52:20,377
"How am I supposed to decipher his words?"

2517
01:52:20,378 --> 01:52:22,048
"How am I supposed to understand his words?"

2518
01:52:22,449 --> 01:52:24,847
"Did I understand him correctly?"

2519
01:52:24,848 --> 01:52:26,649
"Did he mean what I thought he meant?"

2520
01:52:26,979 --> 01:52:28,948
Perhaps he liked me...

2521
01:52:28,949 --> 01:52:32,088
but came to change his mind because an action of mind...

2522
01:52:32,189 --> 01:52:34,088
caused a misunderstanding.

2523
01:52:34,189 --> 01:52:35,757
Perhaps he is yielding...

2524
01:52:35,758 --> 01:52:38,029
in order to give me more chances...

2525
01:52:38,399 --> 01:52:41,128
because he is considerate.

2526
01:52:41,829 --> 01:52:44,968
Perhaps it comes...

2527
01:52:45,069 --> 01:52:48,638
from an instinctive, honest pull. That's what I am curious about.

2528
01:52:52,538 --> 01:52:56,779
It's strange, but for the first time upon joining the show...

2529
01:52:57,548 --> 01:52:58,718
and coming to Singapore,

2530
01:52:59,918 --> 01:53:02,418
the content of my message...

2531
01:53:03,888 --> 01:53:06,388
might change.

2532
01:53:10,958 --> 01:53:14,598
So I wanted to tell you that.

2533
01:53:21,909 --> 01:53:22,909
It's understandable.

2534
01:53:28,748 --> 01:53:31,478
What are you supposed to say upon hearing those words?

2535
01:53:31,479 --> 01:53:32,918
You can't give an answer.

2536
01:53:33,279 --> 01:53:35,917
I would go, "So what?"

2537
01:53:35,918 --> 01:53:38,689
It's as MIYEON said. You can't say anything to that.

2538
01:53:38,989 --> 01:53:41,689
If he wants to send a message, he should just go ahead and do that.

2539
01:53:42,088 --> 01:53:44,158
- That conversation... - I don't understand.

2540
01:53:44,159 --> 01:53:46,257
The person who heard those words would feel powerless.

2541
01:53:46,258 --> 01:53:47,698
I don't know what he wants her to do.

2542
01:53:47,699 --> 01:53:50,198
So he wanted to have a conversation like this.

2543
01:53:50,199 --> 01:53:51,739
But a conversation is all about exchanging words.

2544
01:53:52,199 --> 01:53:54,768
He simply went, "I don't think I will send you a message today."

2545
01:53:54,769 --> 01:53:56,208
It was a bit like that.

2546
01:53:56,309 --> 01:53:58,909
It feels like she got all the burden.

2547
01:53:59,579 --> 01:54:00,579
Cho A did.

2548
01:54:00,739 --> 01:54:04,378
I thought about it a lot.

2549
01:54:08,388 --> 01:54:12,318
I did feel it little by little.

2550
01:54:12,319 --> 01:54:13,319
Feel what?

2551
01:54:13,489 --> 01:54:15,288
- The change in your mind. - Really?

2552
01:54:15,388 --> 01:54:17,558
So I did expect this outcome...

2553
01:54:17,559 --> 01:54:19,229
- somewhat. - Really?

2554
01:54:20,258 --> 01:54:23,997
Your intention matters the most.

2555
01:54:23,998 --> 01:54:26,439
I hope that you will be honest to yourself.

2556
01:54:28,369 --> 01:54:30,338
That's what I am doing.

2557
01:54:37,248 --> 01:54:39,779
(Cheol Hyeon comes back after a date.)

2558
01:54:39,918 --> 01:54:41,248
- Hello. - You are back.

2559
01:54:41,579 --> 01:54:42,587
Yes.

2560
01:54:42,588 --> 01:54:43,619
So...

2561
01:54:44,348 --> 01:54:48,189
during the remainder of our time, you and I...

2562
01:54:49,888 --> 01:54:53,558
It feels like I am breaking up with you.

2563
01:54:53,559 --> 01:54:55,768
I think I was the most honest one...

2564
01:54:55,769 --> 01:54:57,468
in here.

2565
01:54:58,098 --> 01:55:01,939
So I wanted to share how I felt.

2566
01:55:04,269 --> 01:55:06,208
I have a question.

2567
01:55:06,609 --> 01:55:09,979
You told me that you hated yourself for acting...

2568
01:55:10,548 --> 01:55:11,748
a certain way.

2569
01:55:12,119 --> 01:55:14,218
Which aspects did you hate?

2570
01:55:15,888 --> 01:55:19,519
When I was with other people...

2571
01:55:19,918 --> 01:55:20,918
How should I put it?

2572
01:55:22,159 --> 01:55:26,128
I felt good emotions and excitement.

2573
01:55:27,199 --> 01:55:29,729
- So to you, - I see.

2574
01:55:29,829 --> 01:55:31,269
I expressed my feelings...

2575
01:55:31,798 --> 01:55:33,069
as if they were saved somewhere.

2576
01:55:33,298 --> 01:55:35,439
But now that I was faced with the moment...

2577
01:55:35,809 --> 01:55:37,939
the means and results of my expressions could change,

2578
01:55:38,479 --> 01:55:40,208
I hated myself for some reason.

2579
01:55:43,878 --> 01:55:45,048
I don't understand myself either.

2580
01:55:58,998 --> 01:56:00,229
Okay.

2581
01:56:02,498 --> 01:56:05,098
To be honest, I felt shocked.

2582
01:56:05,199 --> 01:56:10,439
Although I was feeling the change in his behaviours,

2583
01:56:10,538 --> 01:56:14,278
it was quite shocking to hear it...

2584
01:56:14,279 --> 01:56:16,109
in definite words.

2585
01:56:17,248 --> 01:56:20,279
I wanted to ask him about everything,

2586
01:56:20,779 --> 01:56:22,188
but it was a bit hurtful.

2587
01:56:22,189 --> 01:56:23,989
I didn't want to hear it directly.

2588
01:56:24,088 --> 01:56:26,118
It seemed like he no longer had feelings for me.

2589
01:56:26,119 --> 01:56:28,318
Asking him if he no longer had feelings for me...

2590
01:56:28,319 --> 01:56:29,358
would have been hurtful.

2591
01:56:29,359 --> 01:56:31,729
Having that confirmed right away would have been hurtful.

2592
01:56:32,128 --> 01:56:35,829
So I said, "Okay." I accepted what happened.

2593
01:56:41,399 --> 01:56:43,109
Shall we go and eat something?

2594
01:56:44,138 --> 01:56:45,138
Okay.

2595
01:56:47,479 --> 01:56:48,479
Go ahead.

2596
01:56:48,480 --> 01:56:50,377
Shall I go ahead? Okay.

2597
01:56:50,378 --> 01:56:51,819
(Yong Woo leaves first.)

2598
01:57:06,298 --> 01:57:07,428
Did you have a good date?

2599
01:57:07,699 --> 01:57:09,899
- Did you have fun? - I had fun.

2600
01:57:10,699 --> 01:57:12,038
What was the conversation about?

2601
01:57:13,338 --> 01:57:14,968
Did you have a good time?

2602
01:57:15,508 --> 01:57:16,739
I had a good time.

2603
01:57:17,538 --> 01:57:19,337
People were eating delivered food.

2604
01:57:19,338 --> 01:57:20,609
I should go and steal a bite.

2605
01:57:22,048 --> 01:57:27,019
(Cho A becomes thoughtful on the terrace.)

2606
01:57:43,628 --> 01:57:47,668
(She leaves after pondering for a while.)

2607
01:57:49,538 --> 01:57:51,468
She must be really hurt.

2608
01:57:52,309 --> 01:57:53,638
She must be really upset.

2609
01:57:54,208 --> 01:57:57,047
Had I been Cho A, I would have bawled.

2610
01:57:57,048 --> 01:57:58,479
Gosh, it's sad.

2611
01:57:59,748 --> 01:58:01,678
A woman's hunch is...

2612
01:58:02,748 --> 01:58:04,019
- It's so scary. - I know.

2613
01:58:05,319 --> 01:58:07,388
It's because of his sense of responsibility.

2614
01:58:08,258 --> 01:58:10,229
He thinks he needs to be...

2615
01:58:10,329 --> 01:58:12,498
responsible for his choice.

2616
01:58:12,998 --> 01:58:15,127
Yong Woo is someone who is very sensitive...

2617
01:58:15,128 --> 01:58:16,928
about being responsible.

2618
01:58:17,229 --> 01:58:19,898
- This is quite open too. - Yes.

2619
01:58:19,899 --> 01:58:23,968
So he suppressed his honest feelings for other women...

2620
01:58:24,338 --> 01:58:25,878
because he valued his sense of responsibility more.

2621
01:58:25,979 --> 01:58:28,547
I think this happened because he felt like...

2622
01:58:28,548 --> 01:58:31,048
he should maintain his initial feelings until the end.

2623
01:58:31,149 --> 01:58:34,518
I am amazed by the extent of his cluelessness...

2624
01:58:34,519 --> 01:58:35,747
which stemmed...

2625
01:58:35,748 --> 01:58:36,988
from his sense of responsibility...

2626
01:58:36,989 --> 01:58:38,588
- overshadowing his feelings. - It's understandable.

2627
01:58:39,189 --> 01:58:42,859
I can't do this. I am so stressed out.

2628
01:58:43,489 --> 01:58:45,158
- I don't know. - MIYEON is stressed out.

2629
01:58:45,159 --> 01:58:47,659
Had they had this conversation sooner,

2630
01:58:48,029 --> 01:58:50,528
things wouldn't have gotten so bad.

2631
01:58:50,529 --> 01:58:52,637
Yong Woo kept up the facade for too long.

2632
01:58:52,638 --> 01:58:54,997
Since he is doing this toward the end,

2633
01:58:54,998 --> 01:58:56,468
I don't understand him.

2634
01:58:56,569 --> 01:58:58,137
He could have been more free.

2635
01:58:58,138 --> 01:58:59,638
That's right. I agree.

2636
01:58:59,838 --> 01:59:02,648
He didn't know about his true feelings...

2637
01:59:02,649 --> 01:59:04,348
until now.

2638
01:59:04,708 --> 01:59:07,148
But because of something or someone,

2639
01:59:07,149 --> 01:59:10,718
Yong Woo faced a side of him he didn't know about.

2640
01:59:10,819 --> 01:59:13,858
Since he didn't want to deceive the other person,

2641
01:59:13,859 --> 01:59:16,088
he honestly revealed how he felt.

2642
01:59:16,428 --> 01:59:18,528
He can't hide his feelings...

2643
01:59:18,529 --> 01:59:22,028
and make the other person think that he continues to like her.

2644
01:59:22,029 --> 01:59:23,729
I think this is better.

2645
01:59:25,199 --> 01:59:27,538
Why isn't Cho A coming downstairs? We need to eat.

2646
01:59:32,138 --> 01:59:33,208
Cho A, hurry up and eat.

2647
01:59:33,508 --> 01:59:35,137
It isn't popular.

2648
01:59:35,138 --> 01:59:36,609
Hurry up and eat.

2649
01:59:37,848 --> 01:59:38,949
- Ju Yeon. - Yes?

2650
01:59:39,519 --> 01:59:40,547
Come here for a second.

2651
01:59:40,548 --> 01:59:42,288
(Yong Woo calls over Ju Yeon.)

2652
01:59:44,348 --> 01:59:46,418
- What is it? - What? It's nothing.

2653
01:59:47,588 --> 01:59:51,189
Today, I had a refreshing moment after going on dates...

2654
01:59:51,288 --> 01:59:53,228
with the same person.

2655
01:59:53,229 --> 01:59:54,229
Yes.

2656
01:59:54,899 --> 01:59:55,928
It was nice, wasn't it?

2657
01:59:56,668 --> 01:59:58,939
It was nice, but the point is a bit different.

2658
01:59:59,369 --> 02:00:03,109
I thought my decision wouldn't change,

2659
02:00:05,538 --> 02:00:07,137
but waves came.

2660
02:00:07,138 --> 02:00:09,178
I see. Was it because of the date you had today?

2661
02:00:09,508 --> 02:00:12,748
Yes. But it didn't happen because I had someone.

2662
02:00:13,149 --> 02:00:16,548
It went from yes to the middle.

2663
02:00:16,918 --> 02:00:18,417
(I see.)

2664
02:00:18,418 --> 02:00:19,458
Do you understand?

2665
02:00:19,619 --> 02:00:22,388
The new date was like a big day.

2666
02:00:24,388 --> 02:00:27,828
To be honest, I don't understand...

2667
02:00:27,829 --> 02:00:29,128
what you are talking about.

2668
02:00:30,668 --> 02:00:33,699
I had a talk with Cho A just now.

2669
02:00:34,538 --> 02:00:37,609
The message I will send today...

2670
02:00:38,038 --> 02:00:41,338
might be different from the last time.

2671
02:00:42,109 --> 02:00:44,449
I told her everything honestly.

2672
02:00:47,079 --> 02:00:48,418
I also had...

2673
02:00:49,888 --> 02:00:51,088
Was there a change in the atmosphere?

2674
02:00:52,088 --> 02:00:54,458
- Things have been quite one-sided. - Yes.

2675
02:00:54,888 --> 02:00:56,458
It was like a one-way street.

2676
02:00:56,559 --> 02:00:59,029
Talking to Yun Jae...

2677
02:00:59,329 --> 02:01:01,427
made me see the sides...

2678
02:01:01,428 --> 02:01:04,269
I wouldn't have seen if it weren't for today's date.

2679
02:01:04,569 --> 02:01:07,699
- I saw those sides of Yun Jae. - I know. I had the same thought.

2680
02:01:10,468 --> 02:01:11,708
You are like me.

2681
02:01:13,239 --> 02:01:15,207
I see that our faces weren't the only thing we had in common.

2682
02:01:15,208 --> 02:01:16,649
I can't believe it.

2683
02:01:17,508 --> 02:01:19,918
I hope you won't do this.

2684
02:01:20,019 --> 02:01:24,548
Even if your feelings haven't changed,

2685
02:01:24,649 --> 02:01:25,787
the little damages...

2686
02:01:25,788 --> 02:01:28,559
you might not want to tell me about could pile up.

2687
02:01:28,989 --> 02:01:33,427
Those damages might make you close up...

2688
02:01:33,428 --> 02:01:34,858
(He is worried about Ju Yeon making a dishonest choice.)

2689
02:01:34,859 --> 02:01:36,128
because you don't want to get hurt.

2690
02:01:37,128 --> 02:01:38,939
But if you do that...

2691
02:01:39,769 --> 02:01:41,668
You will regret it later if you live that way.

2692
02:01:44,968 --> 02:01:47,108
You need to be honest with yourself.

2693
02:01:47,109 --> 02:01:50,949
Otherwise, you might meet the best person...

2694
02:01:51,348 --> 02:01:53,048
and fail to show your best self.

2695
02:01:54,449 --> 02:01:55,689
Then you will end up running away with an excuse.

2696
02:01:56,449 --> 02:01:58,348
I did that many times.

2697
02:01:59,019 --> 02:02:02,188
In retrospect, I regret...

2698
02:02:02,189 --> 02:02:03,388
every single one of those occasions.

2699
02:02:04,029 --> 02:02:07,128
In retrospect, there was someone who could have been my spouse.

2700
02:02:07,559 --> 02:02:08,798
So I regret it.

2701
02:02:10,529 --> 02:02:13,638
You don't want me to jump to conclusions...

2702
02:02:14,399 --> 02:02:17,208
and run away in order to avoid getting hurt.

2703
02:02:18,008 --> 02:02:20,708
That's what usually happens. I have done it before.

2704
02:02:21,708 --> 02:02:22,908
Understood?

2705
02:02:22,909 --> 02:02:25,579
You told me what I needed to hear in this situation.

2706
02:02:26,619 --> 02:02:27,778
- Okay. - Okay?

2707
02:02:27,779 --> 02:02:29,688
Yes. Good luck to you too.

2708
02:02:29,689 --> 02:02:30,787
Good luck. Let's go and eat.

2709
02:02:30,788 --> 02:02:33,917
You changed many things...

2710
02:02:33,918 --> 02:02:34,958
in my opinion.

2711
02:02:35,859 --> 02:02:36,958
That might be the case.

2712
02:02:37,729 --> 02:02:39,559
- Se Seung, was it good? - These four...

2713
02:02:41,229 --> 02:02:43,028
Did you enjoy spending money?

2714
02:02:43,029 --> 02:02:44,167
Did you enjoy spending money?

2715
02:02:44,168 --> 02:02:46,569
It wasn't easy to spend money.

2716
02:02:47,168 --> 02:02:49,439
Just how much did you drink?

2717
02:02:50,239 --> 02:02:51,837
Did you drink outside?

2718
02:02:51,838 --> 02:02:53,638
- Did you drink here? - I drank.

2719
02:02:53,739 --> 02:02:56,809
We came back early and drank.

2720
02:02:57,178 --> 02:02:58,178
Jae Hyung.

2721
02:03:04,689 --> 02:03:06,319
Please don't look at me as if I am worthless.

2722
02:03:07,319 --> 02:03:08,757
That isn't true.

2723
02:03:08,758 --> 02:03:10,427
- I looked at you like this. - I see.

2724
02:03:10,428 --> 02:03:11,428
All right.

2725
02:03:11,429 --> 02:03:12,659
Here.

2726
02:03:13,958 --> 02:03:17,329
That's a bit... It's like this.

2727
02:03:17,869 --> 02:03:20,167
- It's... Yes. - Isn't it Jung Sub?

2728
02:03:20,168 --> 02:03:21,699
- The latissimus dorsi. - Jung Sub.

2729
02:03:24,439 --> 02:03:25,468
All right.

2730
02:03:27,239 --> 02:03:28,278
(You have 3 days before making the final decision.)

2731
02:03:28,279 --> 02:03:29,448
(Who made your heart flutter today?)

2732
02:03:29,449 --> 02:03:30,609
(Send the name and message and we will deliver it anonymously.)

2733
02:03:30,878 --> 02:03:31,949
It's a war.

2734
02:03:32,218 --> 02:03:33,417
It's a ruckus.

2735
02:03:33,418 --> 02:03:35,217
- I know. - I am excited and scared.

2736
02:03:35,218 --> 02:03:36,518
Today, it's really hard.

2737
02:03:36,519 --> 02:03:37,949
- Seriously. - Today, it's really hard.

2738
02:03:38,418 --> 02:03:39,489
All right.

2739
02:03:41,218 --> 02:03:42,528
(You have 3 days before making the final decision.)

2740
02:03:42,529 --> 02:03:44,988
(Who made your heart flutter today?)

2741
02:03:44,989 --> 02:03:47,529
(Send the name and message and we will deliver it anonymously.)

2742
02:03:55,668 --> 02:03:56,909
I had many thoughts.

2743
02:03:58,809 --> 02:04:01,108
It wasn't after a date with someone...

2744
02:04:01,109 --> 02:04:02,677
who liked me.

2745
02:04:02,678 --> 02:04:04,847
The message came after a date...

2746
02:04:04,848 --> 02:04:06,449
with someone else.

2747
02:04:06,878 --> 02:04:09,588
So I was curious about the result.

2748
02:04:18,899 --> 02:04:20,927
(To Ji Won, I want to have a time I won't regret.)

2749
02:04:20,928 --> 02:04:24,528
(To Ji Won, I want to have a time I won't regret.)

2750
02:04:24,529 --> 02:04:28,337
I sent it to Ji Won. "I want to have a time I won't regret."

2751
02:04:28,338 --> 02:04:29,468
I sent that message.

2752
02:04:37,008 --> 02:04:39,377
It felt so strange.

2753
02:04:39,378 --> 02:04:42,218
Sitting there was so hard.

2754
02:04:55,498 --> 02:04:57,468
(Yong Woo gets up.)

2755
02:04:57,628 --> 02:04:59,798
(He takes out beer.)

2756
02:05:00,468 --> 02:05:01,739
I thought you weren't going to drink.

2757
02:05:02,038 --> 02:05:05,338
Today, I can't help but drink.

2758
02:05:06,378 --> 02:05:07,579
Are you drinking in the end?

2759
02:05:08,409 --> 02:05:09,978
- Why? It's so sudden. - Is it okay to drink?

2760
02:05:09,979 --> 02:05:11,048
Did you have a change of heart?

2761
02:05:12,178 --> 02:05:14,178
It's for circulation.

2762
02:05:15,178 --> 02:05:17,319
Should you be drinking?

2763
02:05:40,878 --> 02:05:44,649
(Everyone's feelings have been sent.)

2764
02:05:47,178 --> 02:05:48,989
(Unsure)

2765
02:05:52,149 --> 02:05:54,119
I really can't predict the results today.

2766
02:05:55,218 --> 02:05:56,229
I mean everything.

2767
02:06:05,229 --> 02:06:11,538
(I want to have a time I won't regret.)

2768
02:06:11,739 --> 02:06:14,338
I was certain that it was from Jae Hyung.

2769
02:06:15,439 --> 02:06:17,579
"I want to have a time I won't regret."

2770
02:06:18,008 --> 02:06:20,119
That was the message.

2771
02:06:23,088 --> 02:06:24,788
The emoji was a must.

2772
02:06:24,888 --> 02:06:27,258
It showed how I felt.

2773
02:06:27,758 --> 02:06:30,659
After the date and before the message,

2774
02:06:30,758 --> 02:06:34,257
she didn't talk to me much.

2775
02:06:34,258 --> 02:06:36,029
I felt like she was sullen.

2776
02:06:36,128 --> 02:06:39,038
It felt a bit strange, so...

2777
02:06:39,468 --> 02:06:41,239
What? That was how I felt.

2778
02:06:41,338 --> 02:06:43,508
What?

2779
02:06:44,668 --> 02:06:49,079
(She received a message with Jae Hyung's feeling.)

2780
02:06:58,548 --> 02:07:02,659
(Why are you being curt?)

2781
02:07:08,399 --> 02:07:11,127
He broke down.

2782
02:07:11,128 --> 02:07:12,868
- Seriously. - He is so easy to read.

2783
02:07:12,869 --> 02:07:14,338
That's a facial expression I haven't seen before.

2784
02:07:15,168 --> 02:07:16,369
Jae Hyung is so funny.

2785
02:07:17,369 --> 02:07:19,508
Was I being curt?

2786
02:07:28,149 --> 02:07:30,288
I sent, "Why are you being curt?"

2787
02:07:32,048 --> 02:07:34,689
I waited for Jae Hyung to come back.

2788
02:07:34,788 --> 02:07:37,087
We were talking about how the date was.

2789
02:07:37,088 --> 02:07:39,098
(They were talking earlier.)

2790
02:07:39,199 --> 02:07:40,627
We didn't have much money to spend on food.

2791
02:07:40,628 --> 02:07:43,369
No one told you to lose, okay?

2792
02:07:45,468 --> 02:07:46,899
"No one told you to lose, okay?"

2793
02:07:47,338 --> 02:07:50,269
That was the first thing he said to me.

2794
02:07:50,369 --> 02:07:51,908
You won't see our feet.

2795
02:07:51,909 --> 02:07:54,338
I can see them fine.

2796
02:07:55,708 --> 02:07:57,649
It hurt my feelings.

2797
02:07:58,449 --> 02:08:00,548
I felt a bit embarrassed.

2798
02:08:01,779 --> 02:08:03,989
I was quite upset.

2799
02:08:04,519 --> 02:08:06,888
I didn't think that I was being curt.

2800
02:08:07,288 --> 02:08:10,458
Did she become sullen because of that?

2801
02:08:10,859 --> 02:08:12,258
I wanted to clear up the misunderstanding.

2802
02:08:14,199 --> 02:08:17,899
(Despite being upset, they chose each other.)

2803
02:08:26,739 --> 02:08:32,819
(I want to know if you had fun and if you didn't have regrets.)

2804
02:08:33,319 --> 02:08:34,848
I sent it to Se Seung.

2805
02:08:35,218 --> 02:08:37,748
I wanted to know how her date was.

2806
02:08:45,559 --> 02:08:48,798
(Jung Sub chose your sibling.)

2807
02:08:48,998 --> 02:08:51,098
I guess Jung Sub still likes Se Seung.

2808
02:08:52,098 --> 02:08:55,098
Perhaps he wavered for a short while.

2809
02:08:55,199 --> 02:08:56,938
They aren't in a relationship.

2810
02:08:56,939 --> 02:08:58,738
It was...

2811
02:08:58,739 --> 02:09:01,109
a week after he met Se Seung.

2812
02:09:01,439 --> 02:09:02,878
Since he sent her a message,

2813
02:09:02,979 --> 02:09:06,779
I thought, "I guess there aren't any major changes."

2814
02:09:08,678 --> 02:09:10,819
Se Seung, are you tired?

2815
02:09:11,449 --> 02:09:12,758
- No. - Are you okay?

2816
02:09:13,718 --> 02:09:14,819
You look soft.

2817
02:09:15,159 --> 02:09:17,388
Se Seung has so much stamina.

2818
02:09:17,489 --> 02:09:18,489
That's right.

2819
02:09:18,859 --> 02:09:21,159
I could see that during the final of the chicken fight.

2820
02:09:21,498 --> 02:09:23,699
The swimming pool was about to close,

2821
02:09:24,968 --> 02:09:26,769
but she swam diligently...

2822
02:09:27,199 --> 02:09:28,569
to digest the food.

2823
02:09:40,218 --> 02:09:41,248
Seriously.

2824
02:09:41,348 --> 02:09:44,188
(Thank you for giving me a fun day.)

2825
02:09:44,189 --> 02:09:47,558
(Let's enjoy the remaining days so that there won't be any regrets.)

2826
02:09:47,559 --> 02:09:53,029
(Se Seung sent a message to Cheol Hyeon.)

2827
02:09:54,329 --> 02:09:55,859
I sent it to Cheol Hyeon.

2828
02:09:56,329 --> 02:09:59,198
When we looked at the sunset on the yacht,

2829
02:09:59,199 --> 02:10:01,239
I thought it was nice...

2830
02:10:01,399 --> 02:10:05,007
to be with someone who had the same sentimentality...

2831
02:10:05,008 --> 02:10:06,309
and depth.

2832
02:10:07,109 --> 02:10:10,579
If the date brings me happiness and joy,

2833
02:10:10,809 --> 02:10:13,377
I think it's right to send a message to the person...

2834
02:10:13,378 --> 02:10:15,279
I went on a date with.

2835
02:10:15,918 --> 02:10:18,748
I don't know how Jung Sub will take it.

2836
02:10:20,359 --> 02:10:24,788
(Jung Sub doesn't receive a message.)

2837
02:10:34,668 --> 02:10:37,869
He sent me a message, but I didn't send him one.

2838
02:10:38,369 --> 02:10:39,809
My heart ached.

2839
02:10:40,508 --> 02:10:42,649
It wasn't like that.

2840
02:10:43,048 --> 02:10:44,748
I don't know how to solve this problem.

2841
02:10:45,779 --> 02:10:49,388
Not receiving any messages put me in a bad mood.

2842
02:11:03,098 --> 02:11:07,998
(No one chose your sibling.)

2843
02:11:08,439 --> 02:11:12,109
Cheol Hyeon and Se Seung had a great date,

2844
02:11:12,239 --> 02:11:13,909
so I wasn't surprised.

2845
02:11:14,309 --> 02:11:16,508
But the message still made my heart ache.

2846
02:11:22,649 --> 02:11:25,989
(Se Seung chose your sibling.)

2847
02:11:28,159 --> 02:11:32,998
"Did the date bring changes to their relationship?"

2848
02:11:33,529 --> 02:11:36,569
"I hope it goes well." I had that thought.

2849
02:11:41,538 --> 02:11:46,239
(Ji Won, let's go on a date!)

2850
02:11:50,779 --> 02:11:52,649
I sent it to Ji Won.

2851
02:11:53,319 --> 02:11:56,949
On the terrace, I told Ji Won that I wanted to go on a date with her.

2852
02:11:57,119 --> 02:11:59,318
I had never gone on a proper date with her,

2853
02:11:59,319 --> 02:12:01,718
so I had regrets.

2854
02:12:05,388 --> 02:12:09,798
I think it's Cheol Hyeon, the one I talked to the day before.

2855
02:12:10,098 --> 02:12:12,398
I understand why Cheol Hyeon sent Ji Won a message.

2856
02:12:12,399 --> 02:12:13,399
- Yes. - That's right.

2857
02:12:13,400 --> 02:12:15,137
- She was on his mind. - Yesterday...

2858
02:12:15,138 --> 02:12:17,569
But he said the date was good.

2859
02:12:17,909 --> 02:12:19,938
He has more feelings for JI Won.

2860
02:12:19,939 --> 02:12:21,678
- More feelings. - That day...

2861
02:12:22,678 --> 02:12:27,418
(Jae Hyung and Cheol Hyeon chose your sibling.)

2862
02:12:29,848 --> 02:12:31,048
Thank goodness. All right.

2863
02:12:32,019 --> 02:12:33,489
Now, she will do well on her own.

2864
02:12:36,758 --> 02:12:37,788
(Glancing over)

2865
02:12:39,699 --> 02:12:40,798
What are you looking at?

2866
02:12:41,229 --> 02:12:42,829
The two of you have similar facial expressions.

2867
02:12:44,428 --> 02:12:46,029
The two of you have similar facial expressions.

2868
02:12:46,239 --> 02:12:47,939
You probably do too.

2869
02:12:48,439 --> 02:12:52,109
It's my first connection with Ji Won.

2870
02:12:52,538 --> 02:12:54,409
It happened with my looks.

2871
02:12:54,538 --> 02:12:55,579
What an honour.

2872
02:13:01,918 --> 02:13:06,619
(Let's go to the gallery!)

2873
02:13:09,019 --> 02:13:11,258
There was a gallery she wanted to check out.

2874
02:13:11,829 --> 02:13:13,628
I sent her a message to go there with me.

2875
02:13:14,758 --> 02:13:17,729
While spending time at a bar...

2876
02:13:18,428 --> 02:13:21,098
What is that? It looks like a coconut.

2877
02:13:21,239 --> 02:13:22,369
It's a museum.

2878
02:13:22,498 --> 02:13:24,309
- It would be nice to go there. - Right?

2879
02:13:25,168 --> 02:13:26,908
"It would be nice to go there next."

2880
02:13:26,909 --> 02:13:29,338
We had that conversation.

2881
02:13:29,678 --> 02:13:32,917
I didn't have any second thoughts about sending a message to Yun Ha.

2882
02:13:32,918 --> 02:13:33,918
Not at all.

2883
02:13:35,149 --> 02:13:36,519
I like Yun Ha.

2884
02:13:37,019 --> 02:13:39,989
I don't think that will change.

2885
02:13:41,258 --> 02:13:43,258
If I get a chance to choose my next date,

2886
02:13:43,359 --> 02:13:45,029
I will choose Yun Ha.

2887
02:13:45,588 --> 02:13:49,359
I like Yun Na no matter what right now.

2888
02:13:55,498 --> 02:14:00,378
(It was nice to become close to you, Mr. Chipmunk.)

2889
02:14:03,708 --> 02:14:05,048
I think it's from Ju Yeon.

2890
02:14:05,848 --> 02:14:07,519
Chip... Chap?

2891
02:14:08,548 --> 02:14:11,319
- Chipmunk. - Yes. She called me Mr. Chipmunk.

2892
02:14:12,718 --> 02:14:14,019
I think it's from Ju Yeon.

2893
02:14:14,159 --> 02:14:16,258
I was thankful for Yun Jae.

2894
02:14:16,588 --> 02:14:17,787
Through Yun Jae,

2895
02:14:17,788 --> 02:14:21,128
I could free myself from thoughts and have a good time.

2896
02:14:21,729 --> 02:14:22,928
So I sent it to Yun Jae.

2897
02:14:23,798 --> 02:14:25,769
I had a date with Ju Yeon,

2898
02:14:26,168 --> 02:14:29,338
so I felt bad for her.

2899
02:14:31,468 --> 02:14:33,909
I was sitting next to Yun Jae.

2900
02:14:37,809 --> 02:14:39,948
I could feel that he felt bad.

2901
02:14:39,949 --> 02:14:40,979
(Laughing)

2902
02:14:41,119 --> 02:14:44,548
But it's nothing to feel bad about.

2903
02:14:48,689 --> 02:14:52,529
(No one chose your sibling.)

2904
02:14:57,529 --> 02:14:59,498
I think it's like that.

2905
02:15:00,069 --> 02:15:01,537
- You know about Jjokki Jjokki. - Jjokki Jjokki.

2906
02:15:01,538 --> 02:15:02,638
You know about Jjokki Jjokki.

2907
02:15:02,739 --> 02:15:07,178
(Did you have a good time with Dr. Oh Eun Yeong?)

2908
02:15:07,338 --> 02:15:09,478
He received a message.

2909
02:15:09,479 --> 02:15:11,308
He received it from the one next to him.

2910
02:15:11,309 --> 02:15:12,677
She listened to his worries.

2911
02:15:12,678 --> 02:15:14,347
"Did you have a good time with Dr. Oh Eun Yeong?"

2912
02:15:14,348 --> 02:15:15,917
- It's Yun Ha. - Yun Ha is referring to herself.

2913
02:15:15,918 --> 02:15:17,787
- Yun Ha. - "I am Dr. Oh Eun Yeong."

2914
02:15:17,788 --> 02:15:19,488
She was saying, "I am your Dr. Oh Eun Yeong."

2915
02:15:19,489 --> 02:15:21,059
"How was your time with me?"

2916
02:15:21,258 --> 02:15:22,887
"I will solve all worries."

2917
02:15:22,888 --> 02:15:24,928
That's right. She wants him to come closer.

2918
02:15:25,859 --> 02:15:27,797
Dr. Oh Eun Yeong takes care of all worries.

2919
02:15:27,798 --> 02:15:30,798
Their date was like a therapy session.

2920
02:15:31,199 --> 02:15:35,638
(Did you have a good time with Dr. Oh Eun Yeong?)

2921
02:15:42,979 --> 02:15:44,478
(Well)

2922
02:15:44,479 --> 02:15:47,248
I thought very hard about that matter.

2923
02:15:47,649 --> 02:15:49,547
Even while having a strange conversation,

2924
02:15:49,548 --> 02:15:51,748
I thought very hard about it.

2925
02:15:52,019 --> 02:15:53,788
I wanted to send it to Yong Woo.

2926
02:16:02,399 --> 02:16:06,298
Due to various situations,

2927
02:16:06,699 --> 02:16:09,498
I couldn't help but worry.

2928
02:16:10,269 --> 02:16:13,809
(Yun Ha sent a message to Yong Woo after many thoughts.)

2929
02:16:17,208 --> 02:16:19,579
I received a message from Ju Yeon, but not Yun Ha.

2930
02:16:21,149 --> 02:16:23,649
Still, I made my choice.

2931
02:16:23,919 --> 02:16:25,948
Yun Ha made her choice.

2932
02:16:26,249 --> 02:16:30,458
I think I need to accept it.

2933
02:16:31,059 --> 02:16:32,659
I wasn't happy with it.

2934
02:16:34,259 --> 02:16:36,467
I am anxious that Yun Ha might not send me...

2935
02:16:36,468 --> 02:16:37,829
more messages.

2936
02:16:39,069 --> 02:16:42,438
(Ju Yeon chose your sibling.)

2937
02:16:43,169 --> 02:16:48,138
Firstly, learning that Yun Ha didn't send him a message...

2938
02:16:48,239 --> 02:16:49,809
made me very worried.

2939
02:16:50,048 --> 02:16:52,048
I felt like he would be anxious and hurt.

2940
02:16:56,888 --> 02:17:01,218
After the messages, Yun Jae's face fell.

2941
02:17:17,138 --> 02:17:18,169
You know,

2942
02:17:20,239 --> 02:17:22,479
this time is so dizzying.

2943
02:17:22,708 --> 02:17:24,778
- I feel the same. - I think I am going to throw up.

2944
02:17:28,018 --> 02:17:30,288
Back then,

2945
02:17:30,448 --> 02:17:34,419
the air felt so heavy.

2946
02:17:34,659 --> 02:17:36,528
Yong Woo was to my left and Cho A was to my right.

2947
02:17:44,099 --> 02:17:45,128
Seriously.

2948
02:17:46,768 --> 02:17:48,298
- This is too... - Oh, no.

2949
02:17:48,839 --> 02:17:50,437
- It's too much. - How did they sit like that?

2950
02:17:50,438 --> 02:17:52,207
It's like getting caught...

2951
02:17:52,208 --> 02:17:53,978
- between the parents' fight. - He looks like their son.

2952
02:17:53,979 --> 02:17:55,378
I know. The son.

2953
02:18:02,079 --> 02:18:04,888
Se Seung and Jung Sub were sitting there too.

2954
02:18:05,388 --> 02:18:06,518
It was like that.

2955
02:18:08,858 --> 02:18:13,028
The tension in the air was hard to take.

2956
02:18:22,698 --> 02:18:24,738
(You really are a big sister.)

2957
02:18:24,739 --> 02:18:27,438
(Thank you so much. You are unbelievable.)

2958
02:18:41,589 --> 02:18:45,458
I sent Yun Ha a message and thanked her.

2959
02:18:46,358 --> 02:18:48,028
I received a very hip message.

2960
02:18:48,298 --> 02:18:51,128
He wrote "Thank you so much" in all caps.

2961
02:18:51,329 --> 02:18:53,028
It was very refreshing.

2962
02:18:58,468 --> 02:19:01,638
(Yun Jae and Yong Woo chose your sibling.)

2963
02:19:09,618 --> 02:19:11,288
- What? - It's like a music video.

2964
02:19:11,948 --> 02:19:13,358
- Is this a music video? - Seriously.

2965
02:19:13,518 --> 02:19:14,589
Did you see that?

2966
02:19:14,659 --> 02:19:16,929
- "How dare you choose..." - "How dare you?"

2967
02:19:17,628 --> 02:19:19,729
- "my sister?" - I thought it was like this.

2968
02:19:20,099 --> 02:19:22,197
"I knew it." It looked like he was having that thought.

2969
02:19:22,198 --> 02:19:23,297
"Finally, my sister..."

2970
02:19:23,298 --> 02:19:24,398
I thought it was like this.

2971
02:19:24,399 --> 02:19:25,998
- "After all this time?" - That's right.

2972
02:19:25,999 --> 02:19:28,037
- "I said she was the prettiest." - Seriously.

2973
02:19:28,038 --> 02:19:29,138
"I knew it."

2974
02:19:29,339 --> 02:19:31,339
His facial expression looks so cool.

2975
02:19:31,868 --> 02:19:35,038
(Yun Jae and Yong Woo chose your sibling.)

2976
02:19:40,948 --> 02:19:43,018
I became very surprised upon receiving the message.

2977
02:19:43,349 --> 02:19:45,349
Two people sent her a message.

2978
02:19:46,089 --> 02:19:47,117
I was like, "What?"

2979
02:19:47,118 --> 02:19:49,559
Yun Jae and Yong Woo sent her a message.

2980
02:19:52,388 --> 02:19:54,358
What happened...

2981
02:19:55,128 --> 02:19:58,999
that he sent my sister a message?

2982
02:20:06,339 --> 02:20:10,377
(Thank you for your honesty.)

2983
02:20:10,378 --> 02:20:14,419
(Thank you for your honesty.)

2984
02:20:27,128 --> 02:20:29,559
It was a message from Cho A.

2985
02:20:30,069 --> 02:20:33,069
She thanked me for telling her...

2986
02:20:34,569 --> 02:20:35,768
in her message.

2987
02:20:39,268 --> 02:20:42,908
I was about to have a mental breakdown...

2988
02:20:42,909 --> 02:20:44,948
while sitting there.

2989
02:20:49,919 --> 02:20:52,649
I didn't have any thoughts. It was so hard.

2990
02:21:10,669 --> 02:21:14,079
(All messages have been sent.)

2991
02:21:28,419 --> 02:21:30,659
I didn't receive a message.

2992
02:21:31,188 --> 02:21:32,288
It was my first time.

2993
02:21:38,499 --> 02:21:40,798
I couldn't describe my feeling.

2994
02:21:42,339 --> 02:21:43,368
No.

2995
02:21:43,638 --> 02:21:45,937
I felt a bit like...

2996
02:21:45,938 --> 02:21:47,478
I was betrayed.

2997
02:21:47,479 --> 02:21:49,809
But at the same time, it was as if I shouldn't feel that way.

2998
02:21:50,079 --> 02:21:53,277
"Who am I to feel this way?"

2999
02:21:53,278 --> 02:21:56,318
"We simply chose differently..."

3000
02:21:56,319 --> 02:21:58,588
"while getting to know each other."

3001
02:21:58,589 --> 02:22:02,319
But I still felt disappointed.

3002
02:22:14,968 --> 02:22:19,268
(No one chose your sibling.)

3003
02:22:22,208 --> 02:22:25,309
It was my first time receiving that message.

3004
02:22:25,548 --> 02:22:27,578
"What is this?"

3005
02:22:27,579 --> 02:22:29,018
I had that thought.

3006
02:22:59,048 --> 02:23:00,048
Really?

3007
02:23:03,419 --> 02:23:04,888
Is this about what you told me recently?

3008
02:23:07,989 --> 02:23:09,787
Cho A sat to my right.

3009
02:23:09,788 --> 02:23:11,887
She typed "A woman's hunch is indeed science" on her phone...

3010
02:23:11,888 --> 02:23:13,659
and showed it to me.

3011
02:23:15,929 --> 02:23:18,169
It was suffocating.

3012
02:23:32,179 --> 02:23:36,919
(All messages have been sent.)

3013
02:23:39,089 --> 02:23:41,819
- A few of them... - Se Seung.

3014
02:23:42,118 --> 02:23:43,828
Can we talk for a second?

3015
02:23:43,829 --> 02:23:46,358
(Cheol Hyeon asks Se Seung for a conversation.)

3016
02:23:49,399 --> 02:23:50,468
Let's talk later.

3017
02:23:52,499 --> 02:23:54,468
I am so exhausted.

3018
02:23:54,768 --> 02:23:57,368
- Who sent me a message? - Ji Won.

3019
02:23:57,669 --> 02:23:59,638
- To whom did you send a message? - Ji Won.

3020
02:24:00,108 --> 02:24:02,107
What she wrote was a bit strange.

3021
02:24:02,108 --> 02:24:03,548
She asked me why I was being curt.

3022
02:24:03,809 --> 02:24:06,309
- To whom did you send a message? - Cheol Hyeon.

3023
02:24:07,048 --> 02:24:08,078
It seemed that way.

3024
02:24:08,079 --> 02:24:09,777
Who sent me a message? Who was it?

3025
02:24:09,778 --> 02:24:10,849
Jung Sub.

3026
02:24:13,618 --> 02:24:16,589
I didn't think Jung Sub would send me a message.

3027
02:24:17,559 --> 02:24:19,887
There is a really interesting story.

3028
02:24:19,888 --> 02:24:20,929
Let's go.

3029
02:24:22,798 --> 02:24:25,628
(Jae Hyung and Se Seung go to their room.)

3030
02:24:28,798 --> 02:24:31,638
What's wrong with you?

3031
02:24:35,878 --> 02:24:38,748
I just followed my heart today.

3032
02:24:38,749 --> 02:24:40,979
Today's date was so nice, okay?

3033
02:24:41,349 --> 02:24:42,877
What was nice, the person or the date?

3034
02:24:42,878 --> 02:24:43,919
The date.

3035
02:24:44,018 --> 02:24:46,089
Then you should have sent it to the person you liked, you fool.

3036
02:24:46,419 --> 02:24:48,117
What is the interesting story?

3037
02:24:48,118 --> 02:24:51,027
- Who is it about? - It's so different...

3038
02:24:51,028 --> 02:24:53,328
- from what we thought. - What?

3039
02:24:53,329 --> 02:24:55,697
Cheol Hyeon asked me to talk to him.

3040
02:24:55,698 --> 02:24:57,267
I need to hurry up and go.

3041
02:24:57,268 --> 02:24:58,467
I will tell you at night then.

3042
02:24:58,468 --> 02:25:00,169
It's unrelated. Go ahead.

3043
02:25:00,468 --> 02:25:02,499
How many... Right, you received one message.

3044
02:25:02,698 --> 02:25:04,038
What does he want to talk about?

3045
02:25:04,768 --> 02:25:06,637
I don't know. But that doesn't matter.

3046
02:25:06,638 --> 02:25:08,839
Cheol Hyeon doesn't matter right now.

3047
02:25:09,009 --> 02:25:10,678
What am I going to do about Jung Sub?

3048
02:25:10,679 --> 02:25:11,749
What?

3049
02:25:12,108 --> 02:25:14,319
Jung Sub chose you nonstop,

3050
02:25:14,518 --> 02:25:17,319
but there was a time he wavered.

3051
02:25:18,349 --> 02:25:21,159
I know. That was why I had a hard time.

3052
02:25:21,388 --> 02:25:24,128
- But it wasn't Ji Won. - It was Cho A.

3053
02:25:24,659 --> 02:25:27,298
- How do you know that? - Jung Sub and I talked about it.

3054
02:25:27,458 --> 02:25:30,027
- I see. I thought you didn't know. - Was he in it deep?

3055
02:25:30,028 --> 02:25:32,767
Then you should tell him...

3056
02:25:32,768 --> 02:25:34,068
before you ask him out on a date.

3057
02:25:34,069 --> 02:25:35,437
You asked him out on a date, right?

3058
02:25:35,438 --> 02:25:36,637
I don't know. Hold on.

3059
02:25:36,638 --> 02:25:38,607
Was he in it deep when he liked Cho A?

3060
02:25:38,608 --> 02:25:40,908
- No. - It happened in the beginning.

3061
02:25:40,909 --> 02:25:42,538
- In Gangwon Province. - That's right.

3062
02:25:42,739 --> 02:25:45,707
He told me that he wasn't even confused.

3063
02:25:45,708 --> 02:25:48,679
- Cho A... - But Cho A felt differently.

3064
02:25:48,819 --> 02:25:50,447
Did Jung Sub make many moves on her?

3065
02:25:50,448 --> 02:25:52,348
She told me that he was very forward.

3066
02:25:52,349 --> 02:25:53,758
- During the date? - Yes.

3067
02:25:53,759 --> 02:25:56,388
She told me that she almost wanted to hide.

3068
02:25:56,788 --> 02:25:59,858
It's so different from what Jung Sub told me.

3069
02:26:00,659 --> 02:26:01,729
What do you mean?

3070
02:26:03,229 --> 02:26:05,569
What do you mean? Let's talk later.

3071
02:26:14,339 --> 02:26:17,048
It was like a bolt out of the blue.

3072
02:26:17,278 --> 02:26:19,408
I felt like the foundation was falling.

3073
02:26:19,409 --> 02:26:23,748
I thought Jung Sub was giving me the same kind of certainty.

3074
02:26:23,749 --> 02:26:26,818
I thought my feelings for Jung Sub grew...

3075
02:26:26,819 --> 02:26:29,217
because he gave me certainty.

3076
02:26:29,218 --> 02:26:32,527
But if that never existed, why did my feelings for him grow?

3077
02:26:32,528 --> 02:26:34,429
I became confused.

3078
02:26:35,358 --> 02:26:38,329
I had to go to Jung Sub and clear up his misunderstanding.

3079
02:26:38,569 --> 02:26:40,498
But what happened in the past...

3080
02:26:40,499 --> 02:26:42,468
pulled me down.

3081
02:26:47,509 --> 02:26:49,637
The misunderstanding is growing.

3082
02:26:49,638 --> 02:26:51,309
That's why you can't tell a secret.

3083
02:26:51,509 --> 02:26:53,579
- It spreads right away. - Seriously.

3084
02:26:53,679 --> 02:26:54,778
I am a bit frustrated.

3085
02:26:55,349 --> 02:26:56,579
It's a repeat of the same situation.

3086
02:27:04,028 --> 02:27:06,428
- It would be the best. - We can visit a Korean store...

3087
02:27:06,429 --> 02:27:07,698
and get two days' worth of food.

3088
02:27:07,829 --> 02:27:09,559
I want to eat kimchi stew.

3089
02:27:10,669 --> 02:27:11,729
Did you go there?

3090
02:27:12,268 --> 02:27:14,137
(Yun Ha joins the table.)

3091
02:27:14,138 --> 02:27:15,138
Did you go there?

3092
02:27:16,468 --> 02:27:17,569
Sit down.

3093
02:27:19,239 --> 02:27:20,278
All right.

3094
02:27:20,438 --> 02:27:21,809
- I am going to get some rest. - I like it.

3095
02:27:21,938 --> 02:27:23,947
- It's a bit... - Are you going to get some rest?

3096
02:27:23,948 --> 02:27:25,178
All right.

3097
02:27:25,179 --> 02:27:26,579
- I am going to get some rest. - I like it.

3098
02:27:26,778 --> 02:27:28,618
- It's a bit... - Are you going to get some rest?

3099
02:27:29,249 --> 02:27:30,618
Yun Jae, what's up with you?

3100
02:27:31,118 --> 02:27:32,488
I am tired. I sweated so much.

3101
02:27:32,489 --> 02:27:33,658
I need to wash up.

3102
02:27:33,659 --> 02:27:34,888
(Yun Jae leaves.)

3103
02:27:43,669 --> 02:27:45,168
I always hung out with the others downstairs.

3104
02:27:45,169 --> 02:27:47,968
But I wanted to go to my room right away.

3105
02:27:52,468 --> 02:27:54,778
(Jae Hyung comes downstairs after talking to Se Seung.)

3106
02:27:56,538 --> 02:27:58,479
(Lurking)

3107
02:27:59,448 --> 02:28:01,919
(He calls Ji Won over.)

3108
02:28:06,489 --> 02:28:08,089
You don't smoke, do you?

3109
02:28:08,419 --> 02:28:09,787
- What? - Do you smoke?

3110
02:28:09,788 --> 02:28:10,857
No.

3111
02:28:10,858 --> 02:28:12,729
Why are you hiding?

3112
02:28:13,528 --> 02:28:14,929
- What is it? - A present.

3113
02:28:15,259 --> 02:28:17,729
- A present? What is it? - Yes.

3114
02:28:18,268 --> 02:28:19,527
Did you buy it on the date?

3115
02:28:19,528 --> 02:28:20,868
- Yes. - I see.

3116
02:28:21,298 --> 02:28:23,498
This must be Chinatown.

3117
02:28:23,499 --> 02:28:24,937
(They visited a souvenir store.)

3118
02:28:24,938 --> 02:28:26,208
Are these magnets?

3119
02:28:26,868 --> 02:28:28,538
You should buy a present for Ji Won.

3120
02:28:28,809 --> 02:28:30,349
I will...

3121
02:28:30,708 --> 02:28:32,479
- It's pretty. - I will get this.

3122
02:28:32,608 --> 02:28:34,649
- That one? - This is mine. This is a present.

3123
02:28:34,749 --> 02:28:35,819
Let's see.

3124
02:28:36,149 --> 02:28:37,919
- Will you get a present too? - Yes.

3125
02:28:38,089 --> 02:28:39,717
- A present. - Whose present?

3126
02:28:39,718 --> 02:28:40,759
It's a secret.

3127
02:28:41,089 --> 02:28:43,159
To whom will you give it?

3128
02:28:44,128 --> 02:28:45,687
When we drew on chocolate,

3129
02:28:45,688 --> 02:28:49,197
we drew the sky that was coloured by the sunset.

3130
02:28:49,198 --> 02:28:52,499
So I chose a magnet that depicted a sunset.

3131
02:28:53,698 --> 02:28:55,598
Is it a magnet? What is it?

3132
02:28:55,599 --> 02:28:56,698
Where did you go?

3133
02:28:56,999 --> 02:28:58,838
I got it in Chinatown.

3134
02:28:58,839 --> 02:29:00,978
It's pretty. It's pink.

3135
02:29:00,979 --> 02:29:02,179
It reminds me of our drawing.

3136
02:29:02,739 --> 02:29:03,777
That was why I bought it.

3137
02:29:03,778 --> 02:29:04,978
- Really? - Yes.

3138
02:29:04,979 --> 02:29:06,849
It's similar to our drawing.

3139
02:29:07,319 --> 02:29:08,319
Thank you.

3140
02:29:09,118 --> 02:29:10,178
Are you sullen?

3141
02:29:10,179 --> 02:29:12,388
- No, I am not sullen. - Then why did you write that?

3142
02:29:12,888 --> 02:29:15,217
It seemed like you were being curt.

3143
02:29:15,218 --> 02:29:16,258
- Really? - Yes.

3144
02:29:16,259 --> 02:29:17,659
- I... - Is that your usual self?

3145
02:29:17,759 --> 02:29:19,829
No, it isn't.

3146
02:29:19,989 --> 02:29:22,659
I don't know. I thought you were being curt.

3147
02:29:22,798 --> 02:29:24,069
- Really? - Yes.

3148
02:29:24,929 --> 02:29:27,498
I think I was a bit embarrassed.

3149
02:29:27,499 --> 02:29:29,798
Were you being curt because you were embarrassed?

3150
02:29:32,468 --> 02:29:35,037
I was very happy to see you when you came back.

3151
02:29:35,038 --> 02:29:37,978
I showed my happiness too.

3152
02:29:37,979 --> 02:29:40,277
- You showed your happiness? - During mealtime,

3153
02:29:40,278 --> 02:29:43,148
- you didn't look at me. - You didn't do that.

3154
02:29:43,149 --> 02:29:44,547
I was like, "What?"

3155
02:29:44,548 --> 02:29:48,117
- "Did she have a change of heart?" - A change of heart?

3156
02:29:48,118 --> 02:29:49,188
No, I didn't.

3157
02:29:49,319 --> 02:29:51,089
I answered brusquely...

3158
02:29:51,358 --> 02:29:53,287
since I was playing around.

3159
02:29:53,288 --> 02:29:55,697
That made her feel like I was being curt.

3160
02:29:55,698 --> 02:29:58,797
But it wasn't like that. When there are other people,

3161
02:29:58,798 --> 02:30:01,697
I find it hard to be affectionate.

3162
02:30:01,698 --> 02:30:03,399
I was embarrassed.

3163
02:30:03,938 --> 02:30:05,708
He was like a boy who was going through puberty.

3164
02:30:06,368 --> 02:30:08,739
He was being curt because he was embarrassed? Okay.

3165
02:30:10,649 --> 02:30:11,748
- Were you embarrassed? - Yes.

3166
02:30:11,749 --> 02:30:13,208
(Chuckling)

3167
02:30:13,548 --> 02:30:14,548
All right. I won't do that.

3168
02:30:16,149 --> 02:30:17,149
Okay.

3169
02:30:17,718 --> 02:30:18,718
Thank you.

3170
02:30:19,718 --> 02:30:21,188
Did you do it?

3171
02:30:21,288 --> 02:30:22,518
What?

3172
02:30:23,589 --> 02:30:25,428
- The date? Yes, I did. - Yes.

3173
02:30:25,429 --> 02:30:26,528
- Really? - Yes.

3174
02:30:27,429 --> 02:30:28,759
Really? Who did you ask out on a date?

3175
02:30:28,999 --> 02:30:30,128
(Laughing)

3176
02:30:30,899 --> 02:30:32,027
I should do it now.

3177
02:30:32,028 --> 02:30:33,368
Do you want to go on a date with me tomorrow?

3178
02:30:34,339 --> 02:30:35,498
Do you get to ask in person?

3179
02:30:35,499 --> 02:30:37,267
- Right now, I am asking in person. - Really?

3180
02:30:37,268 --> 02:30:38,268
Yes.

3181
02:30:40,138 --> 02:30:41,408
What is this?

3182
02:30:41,409 --> 02:30:43,078
My goodness.

3183
02:30:43,079 --> 02:30:44,649
Seriously.

3184
02:30:44,749 --> 02:30:45,909
How cute.

3185
02:30:46,278 --> 02:30:48,419
I am suffocating. I am jealous.

3186
02:30:48,979 --> 02:30:50,418
I feel weird.

3187
02:30:50,419 --> 02:30:53,117
- Didn't you want to see this? - I did, but I feel weird.

3188
02:30:53,118 --> 02:30:54,618
Why?

3189
02:30:54,888 --> 02:30:55,888
- I don't know. - Why do you feel weird?

3190
02:30:55,889 --> 02:30:58,687
It's because I am alternating between hot and cold water.

3191
02:30:58,688 --> 02:31:00,627
It does make me wonder if I can laugh.

3192
02:31:00,628 --> 02:31:01,628
Shall we laugh?

3193
02:31:01,629 --> 02:31:02,659
(Laughing)

3194
02:31:05,229 --> 02:31:06,628
What?

3195
02:31:07,128 --> 02:31:09,437
- My goodness. - Other people need to live...

3196
02:31:09,438 --> 02:31:10,839
and be happy.

3197
02:31:12,208 --> 02:31:13,338
I should do it now.

3198
02:31:13,339 --> 02:31:14,679
Do you want to go on a date with me tomorrow?

3199
02:31:15,739 --> 02:31:16,877
Do you get to ask in person?

3200
02:31:16,878 --> 02:31:18,678
- Right now, I am asking in person. - Really?

3201
02:31:18,679 --> 02:31:19,749
Yes.

3202
02:31:21,378 --> 02:31:22,778
- You aren't tired, right? - That's right.

3203
02:31:23,179 --> 02:31:24,447
Let's go on a date tomorrow then.

3204
02:31:24,448 --> 02:31:26,688
I should take a shower early tomorrow.

3205
02:31:28,218 --> 02:31:30,489
I was sitting there for a reason.

3206
02:31:31,089 --> 02:31:34,697
Until today, Yun Ha and my brother...

3207
02:31:34,698 --> 02:31:36,627
messaged each other.

3208
02:31:36,628 --> 02:31:40,838
But today, he didn't receive a message.

3209
02:31:40,839 --> 02:31:43,467
Yun Ha asked me to drink with her.

3210
02:31:43,468 --> 02:31:44,508
So I wondered if she had...

3211
02:31:44,509 --> 02:31:46,569
Right now,

3212
02:31:46,968 --> 02:31:49,478
- things are really dynamic. - Seriously.

3213
02:31:49,479 --> 02:31:52,978
That's why I am there, okay?

3214
02:31:52,979 --> 02:31:55,118
- Let's talk tomorrow. - Okay.

3215
02:31:55,278 --> 02:31:57,187
After talking to Yun Ha,

3216
02:31:57,188 --> 02:31:59,618
I will go back to my room early.

3217
02:32:00,888 --> 02:32:02,217
- I wasn't being curt. - What?

3218
02:32:02,218 --> 02:32:04,387
- I wasn't being curt. - Stop being curt.

3219
02:32:04,388 --> 02:32:05,788
This is... Hold on.

3220
02:32:10,159 --> 02:32:12,968
It doesn't open easily.

3221
02:32:13,298 --> 02:32:16,898
(I was having a mental breakdown.)

3222
02:32:16,899 --> 02:32:20,367
(I continued to feel anxious.)

3223
02:32:20,368 --> 02:32:21,377
(You know...)

3224
02:32:21,378 --> 02:32:22,478
(Glancing over)

3225
02:32:22,479 --> 02:32:24,808
(I focused on 1 person for the past 16 days.)

3226
02:32:24,809 --> 02:32:26,377
(But it changed today...)

3227
02:32:26,378 --> 02:32:27,819
(for the very first time.)

3228
02:32:27,878 --> 02:32:30,688
I had that thought after going on a date with Yun Ha.

3229
02:32:30,888 --> 02:32:32,018
I felt like...

3230
02:32:32,288 --> 02:32:34,989
(I felt like I couldn't handle the situation.)

3231
02:32:39,388 --> 02:32:41,527
(Cheol Hyeon and I are the same.)

3232
02:32:41,528 --> 02:32:43,258
(So the date was nice.)

3233
02:32:43,259 --> 02:32:45,168
(But I am not the type...)

3234
02:32:45,169 --> 02:32:46,867
(to like someone who is exactly like me.)

3235
02:32:46,868 --> 02:32:50,607
(I understood what you meant. I got it.)

3236
02:32:50,608 --> 02:32:53,009
(It suddenly made me thoughtful.)

3237
02:32:57,708 --> 02:32:59,377
(I didn't wear contact lenses.)

3238
02:32:59,378 --> 02:33:01,378
(Your natural eye colour is more beautiful.)

3239
02:33:02,179 --> 02:33:04,748
(I thought, "So this is how I feel.")

3240
02:33:04,749 --> 02:33:05,988
(Do you want to stay here longer?)

3241
02:33:05,989 --> 02:33:08,388
(I want to stay here a bit longer.)
