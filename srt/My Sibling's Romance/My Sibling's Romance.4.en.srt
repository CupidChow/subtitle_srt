00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:03,800
(The first date after moving in)

2
00:00:03,941 --> 00:00:05,010
Cheers.

3
00:00:05,911 --> 00:00:07,841
(I like it.)

4
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:11,280
(I like looking at his face.)

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,150
(I was happy that I got a chance to talk to Cho A.)

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,720
(If you feel like you'll get frostbite, ask me for help.)

7
00:00:18,891 --> 00:00:21,490
(I'll lend you my natural hand warmer.)

8
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,691
(I really liked it at that moment.)

9
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,291
(On the bookshelf in the basement...)

10
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:27,731
(An unidentified album hidden in the house)

11
00:00:28,201 --> 00:00:30,600
(It's finally here.)

12
00:00:32,801 --> 00:00:34,100
- Really? - What is this?

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,901
(Is this your job?)

14
00:00:37,441 --> 00:00:42,180
(Their jobs were revealed in the album.)

15
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:43,541
It isn't a hobby.

16
00:00:44,441 --> 00:00:46,710
(How could there be such a character?)

17
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,820
(And the Introductions written by their siblings)

18
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,651
(We were close siblings who cherished each other.)

19
00:00:52,651 --> 00:00:56,890
(I had a quick flashback of those memories in my head.)

20
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,091
(I went back to that time.)

21
00:01:02,731 --> 00:01:07,201
(Their feelings started to shift.)

22
00:01:07,201 --> 00:01:09,701
(I had to think about to whom I should send the message.)

23
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,741
(After sending the message,)

24
00:01:11,741 --> 00:01:13,371
(I couldn't look Cheol Hyeon in the eye.)

25
00:01:14,211 --> 00:01:16,881
(This is fun.)

26
00:01:16,881 --> 00:01:19,310
(This is fun.)

27
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:24,080
(They got to know more about each other that night.)

28
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,920
We're getting started now.

29
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:28,261
- Good night. - Good night.

30
00:01:28,261 --> 00:01:29,660
I'll arrange the glasses first.

31
00:01:29,821 --> 00:01:30,890
Thank you.

32
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:32,931
- We get to do this here. - Gosh.

33
00:01:33,231 --> 00:01:36,330
- I really think that's important. - It feels very honest.

34
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:37,660
- I mean it. - Yes, truly.

35
00:01:38,901 --> 00:01:40,470
- Are you cold? - Yes, I'm very cold.

36
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:41,500
Are you Cho-ld?

37
00:01:42,841 --> 00:01:44,000
You're witty.

38
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:45,970
Cho A, are you Cho-ld?

39
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:50,580
- Are you Cho-ld? - You guys are great at puns.

40
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,681
- Cheers. - Cheers.

41
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,221
Can you give me an estimate of my diet plan?

42
00:01:56,221 --> 00:01:57,420
- An estimate? - Yes.

43
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,920
There's nothing for me to make an estimate of.

44
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,920
That's not true.

45
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,761
There's nothing to estimate.

46
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,161
- No way. - I think you take good care...

47
00:02:04,161 --> 00:02:05,360
of yourself.

48
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,261
Don't say that.

49
00:02:09,161 --> 00:02:10,561
Why are you whining?

50
00:02:10,561 --> 00:02:12,870
When did I whine?

51
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,370
How dare you whine?

52
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,701
I suddenly see Han Seok Kyu in you.

53
00:02:16,701 --> 00:02:18,340
My goodness.

54
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,071
I really enjoyed that film.

55
00:02:21,071 --> 00:02:23,210
- What's the one in prison? - "The Prison."

56
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,381
I really enjoyed that film.

57
00:02:24,381 --> 00:02:26,710
"I'm the king of this prison."

58
00:02:29,451 --> 00:02:30,781
You're really good.

59
00:02:30,981 --> 00:02:33,451
- No, there isn't. - Why is your voice so sweet?

60
00:02:33,451 --> 00:02:34,550
Is that so?

61
00:02:35,721 --> 00:02:37,490
- Can you sing us a song? - Yes.

62
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,131
- What song? - Are you Sung Si Kyung?

63
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:40,460
"Good night."

64
00:02:44,201 --> 00:02:46,430
You're working from 10am to 10pm tomorrow as well, right?

65
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:49,400
- Yes, 11am to 10pm. - From 11am to 10pm?

66
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,710
Are you going to work tomorrow?

67
00:02:52,011 --> 00:02:53,571
- I'll be staying here tomorrow. - At 9am.

68
00:02:53,571 --> 00:02:55,240
- Will you be staying here? - Yes. I'll be waiting for you.

69
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,311
Come back quickly.

70
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,811
Do as you like.

71
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,520
My goodness.

72
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,550
(BamBam)

73
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,420
- Goodness, she's annoyed. - Really?

74
00:03:06,751 --> 00:03:07,920
I've never seen her making that face before.

75
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,920
Exactly.

76
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,490
- Only her lips are smiling. - Yes.

77
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:15,960
He seemed to be curious...

78
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,201
about Cho A.

79
00:03:17,201 --> 00:03:18,731
He seemed to have a lot of questions for her too.

80
00:03:20,471 --> 00:03:22,640
To be very honest,

81
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,800
of course I am attracted to Se Seung,

82
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,840
but I do want to talk to others too.

83
00:03:28,381 --> 00:03:30,580
The person I would like to get to know more about...

84
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,150
among other people...

85
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,251
is Cho A.

86
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,691
I want to talk with her.

87
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:45,890
Your name "Cho A" is...

88
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:47,360
It's pure Korean, right?

89
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,430
- Originally... - It uses Chinese characters.

90
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,261
- Does it use Chinese characters? - Does it use Chinese characters?

91
00:03:50,261 --> 00:03:51,460
- Yes, Chinese characters. - "Cho" for grass?

92
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,300
- Grass? - Pardon?

93
00:03:53,731 --> 00:03:54,731
Pardon?

94
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,800
Is "Cho" for grass the only "Cho" that you know?

95
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,270
"Cho" for grass is the only "Cho" that I know.

96
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:01,710
If you use "Cho" for first and "a" for me,

97
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,411
it could mean "the first me."

98
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,080
Like "the first me."

99
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,580
But it has a Buddhist meaning...

100
00:04:09,821 --> 00:04:12,251
of overcoming myself.

101
00:04:12,751 --> 00:04:15,561
I used to hate that sometimes.

102
00:04:15,761 --> 00:04:20,131
I sometimes make myself tired from being too harsh...

103
00:04:20,131 --> 00:04:22,061
on myself.

104
00:04:22,361 --> 00:04:25,830
"Is that because of my name?" I wondered sometimes.

105
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,131
Is it that bad?

106
00:04:27,131 --> 00:04:29,501
So I used to think...

107
00:04:29,501 --> 00:04:30,770
about changing my name.

108
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:32,770
Shall we wrap it up now?

109
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:34,980
I'll have this as my last glass today.

110
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,020

(My Sibling's Romance)

119
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,850
(A rainy morning)

120
00:05:48,751 --> 00:05:51,150
I should wash the dishes.

121
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,921
I'm really good at washing the dishes.

122
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,090
I'm good at it too.

123
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,361
Seriously, I'm really good.

124
00:05:56,361 --> 00:05:58,631
Aren't you going to use the dishwasher?

125
00:05:58,631 --> 00:06:00,160
- I won't use it. - You're going to wash them?

126
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,491
- I'll just wash them. - Let's do it together then.

127
00:06:01,491 --> 00:06:02,530
Sure.

128
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,230
You want to wash the dishes together?

129
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,270
Yes.

130
00:06:07,371 --> 00:06:09,040
You want to wash the dishes together?

131
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,371
One can wash them with dish soap...

132
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:11,710
and the other one can rinse them.

133
00:06:12,111 --> 00:06:13,171
- I see. - Is it too cramped?

134
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,671
No, I think it's fine.

135
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,751
I cleaned it. Where should I put it? Here?

136
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,650
Stand here.

137
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,951
- What do you like? - Me?

138
00:06:25,951 --> 00:06:26,951
Yes.

139
00:06:27,751 --> 00:06:29,020
I like everything.

140
00:06:29,421 --> 00:06:31,121
Between a mountain and a sea, you chose a sea.

141
00:06:31,261 --> 00:06:33,131
Between jjamppong and jjajangmyeon, you chose jjajangmyeon.

142
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:36,501
Should we go to a seaside jjajangmyeon restaurant then?

143
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,171
How can he say stuff like that?

144
00:06:42,171 --> 00:06:43,301
He remembers everything.

145
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:45,840
The only thing I could think of was,

146
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,910
"Should I cook jjajangmyeon with seawater for you?"

147
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:49,840
How can he do that?

148
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:52,011
I'll eat jjamppong.

149
00:06:52,951 --> 00:06:54,710
A restaurant that sells both jjamppong and jjajangmyeon?

150
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,321
It's good to share.

151
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,720
It would be nice to go to a place like Namyangju again.

152
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,921
Namyangju is nice.

153
00:06:59,921 --> 00:07:01,150
- But you know, - Yes.

154
00:07:03,261 --> 00:07:06,460
it was fun at that moment too,

155
00:07:08,191 --> 00:07:11,131
but it felt even better when I thought back to it...

156
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:12,301
after I came back.

157
00:07:13,571 --> 00:07:14,830
- Did you think it over? - Yes.

158
00:07:15,671 --> 00:07:17,040
I normally don't say stuff like this.

159
00:07:17,501 --> 00:07:18,540
Darn it.

160
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,480
What do I do with the food waste?

161
00:07:25,681 --> 00:07:28,921
- I'll clean it. I can. - Teach me. I want to know too.

162
00:07:28,921 --> 00:07:31,020
- Do you want to know? - I want to know.

163
00:07:31,321 --> 00:07:33,220
- I'll teach you. - Anyway,

164
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,720
the food waste isn't important.

165
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:39,061
What's important?

166
00:07:39,491 --> 00:07:41,631
What you like is important.

167
00:07:41,631 --> 00:07:43,900
What I want to do next?

168
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,230
I want to talk again.

169
00:07:47,201 --> 00:07:49,970
- Really? - We now have more things...

170
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,100
to talk about.

171
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,171
That's right.

172
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:53,671
You worked hard.

173
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:56,241
(That night)

174
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,011
Se Seung.

175
00:08:00,951 --> 00:08:02,080
Is there anything you would like to eat?

176
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,650
What are you going to have?

177
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,421
I'm not sure, but probably makgeolli.

178
00:08:07,421 --> 00:08:08,590
- Makgeolli? - Yes.

179
00:08:09,421 --> 00:08:10,761
Are the four of you going to do something...

180
00:08:10,761 --> 00:08:12,090
that everyone was supposed to do together?

181
00:08:12,431 --> 00:08:14,691
(They decided to have makgeolli and pajeon on a rainy day.)

182
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:16,660
What should I do?

183
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,431
What?

184
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:21,840
Guys need to go hang out once.

185
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,571
- That's right. - I think now's the time.

186
00:08:23,571 --> 00:08:24,840
They need to decide the hierarchy.

187
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,610
- "Decide the hierarchy." - "Decide the hierarchy."

188
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:28,710
I mean, decide their feelings.

189
00:08:30,411 --> 00:08:31,510
What are you doing tomorrow?

190
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:33,610
We're going to have some girl time.

191
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:34,710
Really?

192
00:08:35,051 --> 00:08:36,120
I'm kidding.

193
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:40,090
So what are you doing tomorrow?

194
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,590
- What day is it tomorrow? - It's Friday.

195
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,760
I don't have any plans.

196
00:08:48,031 --> 00:08:49,330
Shall we have dinner tomorrow?

197
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,000
- Dinner? - Yes.

198
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:54,830
(They suddenly become silent at Cheol Hyeon's appearance.)

199
00:08:56,801 --> 00:08:58,970
So what do you like?

200
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,210
At 6pm?

201
00:09:05,651 --> 00:09:08,480
- At 6pm? - I need to go to work tomorrow,

202
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:11,620
and I need to work until 5pm.

203
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,821
Are you, Yong Woo, and I going?

204
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:17,220
Yes. I think Jae Hyung will join halfway...

205
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:18,691
when we're there.

206
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,460
At 6pm.

207
00:09:25,931 --> 00:09:28,330
(They planned a date tomorrow evening.)

208
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,701
I was happy.

209
00:09:31,801 --> 00:09:35,681
After the first date, he kept having positive feelings towards me.

210
00:09:35,681 --> 00:09:38,681
I was thinking about how nice it would be...

211
00:09:38,681 --> 00:09:40,010
to have some time on our own for a conversation.

212
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:43,480
He asked me out on a date first,

213
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,821
so I was happy.

214
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:56,000
Why? Are you cold? Would you like one?

215
00:10:00,531 --> 00:10:02,340
- He must be very handsome. - What's this?

216
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:05,000
- Gosh. - She's staring at him like that.

217
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,411
I think I'll feel shy.

218
00:10:06,411 --> 00:10:07,811
It might be a bit too much.

219
00:10:07,811 --> 00:10:09,681
Exactly. There's nowhere for him to look at.

220
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:12,010
She either loves him or has bad eyesight.

221
00:10:12,781 --> 00:10:13,850
- What? - Right?

222
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:16,451
She either loves him or has really bad eyesight.

223
00:10:20,651 --> 00:10:22,490
(Feeling shy)

224
00:10:23,521 --> 00:10:24,791
What is it?

225
00:10:25,531 --> 00:10:26,630
Just because.

226
00:10:27,061 --> 00:10:28,931
You're staring at me.

227
00:10:28,931 --> 00:10:30,901
Did I stare? I'm sorry.

228
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:32,901
When you stare at me so intensely,

229
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:36,370
I don't know where to look.

230
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,100
A bright-eyed lunatic.

231
00:10:40,071 --> 00:10:42,240
- I didn't hear you. - Seriously.

232
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,041
Your eyes are so big.

233
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:49,880
- But Se Seung is in love. - She's in love.

234
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,421
It won't be easy for her to go to someone else.

235
00:10:52,421 --> 00:10:54,720
- Exactly. - And she's very affectionate too.

236
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,891
Do you stare into someone's eyes...

237
00:10:56,891 --> 00:10:58,791
when you're head over heels for someone?

238
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,630
If you like someone a lot, you end up looking at them...

239
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,130
- without realizing. - You look at them.

240
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:03,360
- You keep... - Your eyes are drawn to them.

241
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,860
You take an interest in them.

242
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,431
And she said he was very handsome.

243
00:11:06,431 --> 00:11:08,000
- That's right. - She said that she kept staring...

244
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,141
at him because he was so handsome.

245
00:11:09,141 --> 00:11:10,671
If she's at that point...

246
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:11,771
She really fell in love with him.

247
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,271
(Yong Woo comes back home.)

248
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:21,451
- Hey, what's up? - You're back.

249
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,720
I heard the news, Yong Woo.

250
00:11:24,321 --> 00:11:25,490
What news?

251
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:28,120
I heard that the three of you were going to go out...

252
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,521
and leave me alone in this big house.

253
00:11:29,521 --> 00:11:30,691
I heard that too.

254
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,661
Although I'm a part of that plan.

255
00:11:33,931 --> 00:11:36,201
It was supposed to be top secret. Who told her?

256
00:11:36,201 --> 00:11:38,260
Were you going to fool me and go out then?

257
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:41,301
Find the person that leaked the information...

258
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:42,600
and persecute him yourself.

259
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,071
Okay.

260
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,610
Bang.

261
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:50,480
It's too slow for a pilot.

262
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,010
You're right.

263
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:53,451
You're right.

264
00:11:53,911 --> 00:11:55,980
We'll get going, Se Seung.

265
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,681
- Have fun. - We'll get going.

266
00:11:57,681 --> 00:11:58,921
See you.

267
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:22,340
(A bar in Sinsa-dong)

268
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:25,710
(Thank you for always staying by my side.)

269
00:12:26,811 --> 00:12:27,880
It's warm.

270
00:12:29,781 --> 00:12:32,120
I really like this kind of vibe.

271
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,191
The old restaurant vibe.

272
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:37,090
(Jae Hyung heads to the restaurant after his work too.)

273
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:42,031
- Jae Hyung is here. - He came right away.

274
00:12:42,031 --> 00:12:43,061
- Hello. - You're here.

275
00:12:43,061 --> 00:12:44,260
Good job today.

276
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,600
- You worked hard. - It's very cold, right?

277
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,201
(He sits down in the midst of everyone's attention.)

278
00:12:47,201 --> 00:12:49,071
We men somehow came here together.

279
00:12:49,171 --> 00:12:51,271
Exactly. I was fed with lots of hate...

280
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:52,411
because only men were going out.

281
00:12:52,411 --> 00:12:53,470
I'm so full right now.

282
00:12:54,671 --> 00:12:55,880
Se Seung is left behind alone.

283
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,781
- Exactly, she's left behind alone. - I feel bad.

284
00:12:57,781 --> 00:12:59,411
Se Seung was alone at home when we left.

285
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:00,850
- Really? - Yes.

286
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:04,181
Did you hear that? When they said that Se Seung was alone, he said,

287
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,921
- "Really?" - "Is that so?"

288
00:13:05,921 --> 00:13:07,521
- He's not interested. - Do you get what I'm saying?

289
00:13:07,521 --> 00:13:08,921
Whether she's alone or not is none of his business.

290
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:11,090
- He doesn't care at all. - He's not interested.

291
00:13:11,521 --> 00:13:12,561
As expected.

292
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,860
- Thank you. - Thank you.

293
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:17,460
- Do you like ketchup? - Ketchup?

294
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:20,000
I think Yong Woo is going to say, "I can't get enough of it."

295
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:23,171
Are you Yong Woo?

296
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,441
You were momentarily taken back, right?

297
00:13:25,441 --> 00:13:28,941
I wasn't taken back, but I thought that we interacted a lot.

298
00:13:29,181 --> 00:13:31,610
It feels good because I keep making you flustered.

299
00:13:32,551 --> 00:13:33,811
You're so cute.

300
00:13:33,811 --> 00:13:35,551
- Me? - You're so cute.

301
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,750
This is our fifth day.

302
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:42,421
As we're living together,

303
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:44,260
is there anyone...

304
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,931
that you feel more comfortable with?

305
00:13:45,931 --> 00:13:49,830
I know whom my sister likes...

306
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,130
more or less now.

307
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,630
Using this occasion,

308
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:57,840
I wanted to ask naturally about what kind...

309
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:01,710
of personalities they had and what kind of women...

310
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,240
they liked.

311
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,250
I have a fantasy about my brother-in-law.

312
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,681
There's a scene I have imagined in my mind.

313
00:14:09,681 --> 00:14:12,191
After Cho A gets married,

314
00:14:12,191 --> 00:14:16,061
I will enter her house.

315
00:14:16,061 --> 00:14:19,931
The floor is warm, the dinner is ready,

316
00:14:19,931 --> 00:14:22,960
and there's a TV. As we watch the TV,

317
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,401
we'll eat dinner together and have a drink.

318
00:14:25,401 --> 00:14:27,301
That's my dream.

319
00:14:29,071 --> 00:14:30,500
- His imagination is... - He already...

320
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,411
- He wrote a drama. - wrote a scenario.

321
00:14:33,411 --> 00:14:35,141
This is a new way of viewing it.

322
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:37,941
That's together with Cho A. With my brother-in-law,

323
00:14:37,941 --> 00:14:39,580
if Cho A does something wrong,

324
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,850
we'll talk bad about her together.

325
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:44,720
If my brother-in-law does something wrong,

326
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,350
I'll tell him, "You were wrong."

327
00:14:46,421 --> 00:14:49,620
If he tells me, "Cheol Hyeon,"

328
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,321
"don't do that to my wife, it's upsetting,"

329
00:14:51,661 --> 00:14:53,490
I'll tell him, "Okay, I'll try harder."

330
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:55,661
I'm an open-minded person like this.

331
00:14:56,031 --> 00:14:58,860
Anyway, I have a fantasy...

332
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:02,201
about small things like these.

333
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,941
(Laughing)

334
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,441
"Who..."

335
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:08,771
"can fulfill my fantasy?"

336
00:15:08,771 --> 00:15:11,740
I'm observing them very intently.

337
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:14,710
- Someone I feel comfortable with? - Yes, or...

338
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:17,850
After yesterday, I really feel...

339
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,391
The feeling of unity?

340
00:15:19,391 --> 00:15:20,590
That too.

341
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:23,161
Although we haven't talked, you feel close to them internally.

342
00:15:23,161 --> 00:15:25,460
- Yes. - You feel that on your own.

343
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,931
The feeling of closeness grew a lot.

344
00:15:26,931 --> 00:15:31,161
Was there anyone that you didn't get to talk to?

345
00:15:31,161 --> 00:15:32,730
- There is, naturally. - Me too.

346
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:34,830
Jae Hyung, who did you not get to talk to?

347
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:36,701
I've barely talked to Cho A.

348
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,911
In a place with everyone,

349
00:15:39,911 --> 00:15:42,541
I said, "Welcome back. Did you have dinner?"

350
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,541
We did have light...

351
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:46,911
and conventional conversations,

352
00:15:46,911 --> 00:15:50,021
but I didn't get to talk with her properly.

353
00:15:50,021 --> 00:15:53,321
If I have the chance, I would like to talk with her.

354
00:15:53,321 --> 00:15:54,620
It's Cho A for me too.

355
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,791
I physically had less time...

356
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:59,230
- to talk with Cho A. - That's right.

357
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,891
I think everyone agrees.

358
00:16:00,891 --> 00:16:02,531
- Since she comes back late. - That's right.

359
00:16:02,531 --> 00:16:05,201
What about you, Jung Sub? Generally everyone?

360
00:16:05,201 --> 00:16:07,901
- It's Cho A for me too. - Cho A?

361
00:16:08,431 --> 00:16:09,500
Cho A? I see.

362
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,441
Just how charming is Cho A?

363
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:15,911
No, it feels like...

364
00:16:15,911 --> 00:16:18,141
they're saying that because they know he's Cho A's sibling.

365
00:16:18,141 --> 00:16:19,580
- Is that so? - Still.

366
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,321
But psychologically, men won't say that...

367
00:16:22,321 --> 00:16:23,551
just for that reason.

368
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:25,250
Not completely.

369
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:27,350
- They even mentioned her name. - Yes. Mentioning her name means...

370
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:29,191
- they're interested. - Yes. They won't just mention it.

371
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:32,661
I wanted to give Cho A a piece of advice.

372
00:16:32,661 --> 00:16:36,600
And I wanted them to know more...

373
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,600
about Cho A...

374
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,100
so that she wouldn't get hurt.

375
00:16:40,201 --> 00:16:42,000
But I think Cho A feels bad...

376
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,141
about that the most.

377
00:16:43,141 --> 00:16:45,000
She must feel bad about it the most.

378
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,110
I think she's the type to have fun...

379
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:49,541
- when she actually gets to join us. - She has fun.

380
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,110
Then...

381
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:54,381
is there someone that you would like to talk with?

382
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:55,651
Someone that I would like to talk with?

383
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,250
Someone you would like to know more.

384
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,990
For me, it's Yun Ha.

385
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:02,361
- Yun Ha? - I didn't get to talk...

386
00:17:02,361 --> 00:17:04,391
- with her much. - Yun Ha...

387
00:17:04,391 --> 00:17:06,260
was also very busy throughout.

388
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,891
I think so.

389
00:17:07,891 --> 00:17:11,560
I really would like to have some time...

390
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,931
to talk with Cho A. Seriously.

391
00:17:13,931 --> 00:17:15,401
Yong Woo. By the way,

392
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:18,070
it looked like you and Cho A got to talk for a bit yesterday.

393
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,141
- Yes, we did talk for a bit. - Right?

394
00:17:20,141 --> 00:17:21,341
- Yes. - Wasn't that the first time...

395
00:17:21,341 --> 00:17:23,540
- you had a serious talk with her? - Right.

396
00:17:23,911 --> 00:17:26,881
Come to think of it, I didn't get to talk to Ju Yeon a lot either.

397
00:17:27,181 --> 00:17:28,510
- Ju Yeon? - Yes. Yesterday...

398
00:17:29,121 --> 00:17:30,121
Gosh.

399
00:17:30,121 --> 00:17:31,681
Why did he mention his sister?

400
00:17:31,681 --> 00:17:33,050
- What was that? - That's his sister.

401
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,320
- Seriously. - Don't say anything.

402
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,591
- They might figure it out. - Oh, no.

403
00:17:35,591 --> 00:17:36,891
- They're mentioning their sister. - This is getting confusing.

404
00:17:37,091 --> 00:17:38,760
- It's getting confusing. - Do they end up doing it naturally?

405
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,790
- Right. - I guess so.

406
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:40,790
It happens naturally around other people.

407
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:41,931
If I were to be one of them,

408
00:17:41,931 --> 00:17:43,230
would I end up mentioning my sister?

409
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,460
- Right. - I think so.

410
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,460
- Yes. - Gosh.

411
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:46,671
When you're with other guys...

412
00:17:46,671 --> 00:17:48,030
- Of course. - That's interesting.

413
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:49,941
You want the other guys to like your sister.

414
00:17:49,941 --> 00:17:51,570
- I'm fascinated by what they did. - The thing is...

415
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,611
you might bicker and fight with your sibling at home.

416
00:17:54,611 --> 00:17:55,911
- But once you go out... - Right.

417
00:17:55,911 --> 00:17:57,081
They're your biggest supporter.

418
00:17:57,081 --> 00:17:58,381
- Of course. - Gosh.

419
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,681
This is hilarious.

420
00:17:59,881 --> 00:18:02,881
Come to think of it, I didn't get to talk to Ju Yeon a lot either.

421
00:18:03,181 --> 00:18:05,921
- Ju Yeon? - Yes. Yesterday, I went out...

422
00:18:05,921 --> 00:18:08,250
to have a cake with Yun Ha and Se Seung.

423
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:10,260
But I didn't get to talk to Ju Yeon.

424
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,391
(Meanwhile, Se Seung's brother is busy eating.)

425
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:18,800
The grilled squid in butter from the bar was really tasty.

426
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,671
(A while ago)

427
00:18:20,671 --> 00:18:21,671
What's this?

428
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,371
- Gosh, this looks amazing. - This looks so good.

429
00:18:27,871 --> 00:18:29,210
(The food is to his liking.)

430
00:18:29,611 --> 00:18:30,641
This is good.

431
00:18:34,081 --> 00:18:35,710
(It's very hot.)

432
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,750
Gosh, this is really good.

433
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,651
(He can't stop eating the squid.)

434
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,621
(He keeps on eating despite the burned roof of his mouth.)

435
00:18:45,931 --> 00:18:47,260
It was the best.

436
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,931
(Feeling happy)

437
00:18:51,861 --> 00:18:52,871
Cheers.

438
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,401
- Cheers. - Cheers.

439
00:19:00,371 --> 00:19:02,980
By the way, I suddenly got curious about this.

440
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:04,841
When you're looking for someone to date,

441
00:19:04,841 --> 00:19:06,810
is there something you consider important?

442
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:08,451
Like it can be her personality.

443
00:19:08,451 --> 00:19:09,520
- For my relationship? - I see.

444
00:19:09,881 --> 00:19:11,550
Yes. Something like that.

445
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:14,050
The interview isn't over yet.

446
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:15,790
He only cares about his sister.

447
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,520
I think he's asking questions like that...

448
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,020
- to help his sister. - Right. I think so too.

449
00:19:19,161 --> 00:19:20,790
He'll get the answers and tell his sister.

450
00:19:21,631 --> 00:19:23,300
When you're looking for someone to date,

451
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,230
is there something you consider important?

452
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:26,530
Personally,

453
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:28,831
- her vibe is important to me. - Her vibe.

454
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:32,540
What kind of vibe do you look for in a woman?

455
00:19:34,141 --> 00:19:35,911
Everyone has their own aura.

456
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:39,081
Some are aware that their aura is what makes them attractive...

457
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:41,250
and know how to express themselves through it.

458
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,310
I find people like that cool.

459
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,581
What about you, Jae Hyung?

460
00:19:44,581 --> 00:19:45,951
What do you look for in a woman?

461
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:47,320
You're the hardest one to figure out.

462
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:48,550
- Same here. - As for me,

463
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:52,161
I must be the first one with bigger feelings for her.

464
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,391
- Then you're interested. - That works for me.

465
00:19:53,391 --> 00:19:55,861
Here's a thing about my personality. My likes and dislikes are...

466
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:57,460
- very clear. - I see.

467
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,901
I don't stay in the middle.

468
00:19:58,901 --> 00:20:00,730
"Should I give it time and see where it goes?"

469
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:01,871
I rarely do that.

470
00:20:01,871 --> 00:20:04,040
- When I get this clear feeling... - Right.

471
00:20:04,701 --> 00:20:06,941
that she's the one for me,

472
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:09,171
- I turn into a bulldozer. - You go all in?

473
00:20:09,171 --> 00:20:10,581
I go all in.

474
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:12,411
I really hate it...

475
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:13,810
- when people play hard-to-get. - Right.

476
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:15,111
You're just like me. I'm like that too.

477
00:20:15,111 --> 00:20:16,651
I'm straightforward with my feelings.

478
00:20:16,651 --> 00:20:18,750
There are women I can stay as friends...

479
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,250
and women I might have romantic relationships with.

480
00:20:20,391 --> 00:20:22,591
- You can clearly categorize them. - There's a clear division for me.

481
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:24,891
What about you, Yong Woo?

482
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,760
- What about Yong Woo? - What was the question?

483
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:29,191
- I'm sorry. - Let's go over it again.

484
00:20:29,191 --> 00:20:30,331
- Okay. - What's the most important thing...

485
00:20:30,331 --> 00:20:31,960
- you consider when looking... - Right.

486
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,270
- for someone to date? - The most important thing?

487
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:35,530
So far, I mostly dated women...

488
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:37,240
who gave me the spark instantly.

489
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,240
(Especially paying attention)

490
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,710
- For example, - Yes.

491
00:20:39,911 --> 00:20:43,881
there was a woman I dated when my feelings weren't clear.

492
00:20:44,181 --> 00:20:46,250
- Seriously. That relationship... - It didn't last long.

493
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,510
was a bit disappointing in the end.

494
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:50,980
When I got the spark from my heart...

495
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:53,191
and followed through, those relationships went well.

496
00:20:53,191 --> 00:20:54,591
- Right. - I enjoyed such relationships...

497
00:20:54,591 --> 00:20:56,020
a lot more.

498
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,691
But trying to describe...

499
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,161
- this heart-fluttering feeling... - Trying to explain that...

500
00:21:00,161 --> 00:21:03,131
- That's really hard. - It's really not easy.

501
00:21:03,131 --> 00:21:04,201
- Right. - So...

502
00:21:04,201 --> 00:21:05,530
By the way, Brother Yong Woo...

503
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:07,230
Brother Yong Woo? I mean, Yong Woo...

504
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:08,831
- Brother. - I...

505
00:21:08,831 --> 00:21:11,300
I had a slip of the tongue and addressed him as my brother.

506
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,171
But addressing as my brother felt so natural.

507
00:21:13,411 --> 00:21:15,871
"Brother Yong Woo. Gosh, that felt so natural."

508
00:21:15,871 --> 00:21:16,881
- Brother. - Yes.

509
00:21:16,881 --> 00:21:18,780
- Are we going to reveal it now? - Yong Woo...

510
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,050
- Yong Woo... - I just...

511
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:22,411
Did something happen when I was at work?

512
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:24,320
We decided not to talk about this.

513
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:27,050
Wasn't that supposed to be a secret?

514
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:28,121
It was a secret.

515
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:30,490
- Seriously. Goodness. - Yong Woo...

516
00:21:30,621 --> 00:21:32,560
Yong Woo. Then how about this?

517
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:36,861
Here's what I've learned about you from observing you so far.

518
00:21:36,861 --> 00:21:39,970
You get along with everyone and have a kind personality.

519
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:41,171
- It's because you are that person. - Well...

520
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,500
- Is that so? - Yes.

521
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:45,671
You guys should clink your glasses.

522
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,911
- Should I not be on this show? - Clink your glasses.

523
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:51,210
(The house in Seorae Village)

524
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:55,980
(Se Seung is alone in the kitchen.)

525
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,591
I'm not good at cooking.

526
00:22:00,351 --> 00:22:02,050
But I wanted to cook spicy braised chicken.

527
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,060
I thought a lot about it before cooking it.

528
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,131
I decided to try braising just one chicken.

529
00:22:08,091 --> 00:22:09,661
Yes. Next...

530
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,960
Should we cook spicy braised chicken?

531
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,331
(Sounding surprised)

532
00:22:13,701 --> 00:22:14,931
- Do you know how to cook it? - Yes.

533
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:16,641
(Surprised)

534
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:18,671
- Please cook it for us. - Sounds good.

535
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:19,841
I really like that dish.

536
00:22:20,411 --> 00:22:22,171
- How about it? - Should I try cooking it?

537
00:22:22,371 --> 00:22:24,141
Think briefly, and act fast.

538
00:22:24,141 --> 00:22:25,411
- Okay. - That way, you don't have regrets.

539
00:22:25,681 --> 00:22:27,510
- Just try it. - Okay. Fine.

540
00:22:27,951 --> 00:22:29,310
Potatoes and carrots.

541
00:22:29,921 --> 00:22:31,151
Cook the chicken.

542
00:22:31,881 --> 00:22:33,191
Okay.

543
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:43,361
I'll have a lot to clean up afterwards.

544
00:22:49,871 --> 00:22:52,101
- What should we have for desserts? - Desserts?

545
00:22:52,341 --> 00:22:54,010
- Ice cream sounds good. - Should I go and buy ice cream?

546
00:22:54,171 --> 00:22:55,270
I want something refreshing.

547
00:22:55,671 --> 00:22:57,040
Have you been the Watermelon Prince?

548
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,710
You totally look like the Watermelon Prince.

549
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,050
You totally look like that now.

550
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:01,581
By the way, my birthday is in summer.

551
00:23:01,581 --> 00:23:03,081
- On my birthday, - The watermelon?

552
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:04,980
I finish the entire watermelon all by myself.

553
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,891
- No. Not that. - Watermelons...

554
00:23:07,421 --> 00:23:08,451
The boat...

555
00:23:08,451 --> 00:23:10,490
(Only Jung Sub gets a message.)

556
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:13,091
My maternal family is...

557
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:14,490
(Shush! This is a private message only for you.)

558
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:15,960
(A female participant requests to talk to you in private.)

559
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,361
(Tell the guys you're going to the bathroom...)

560
00:23:17,361 --> 00:23:18,861
(and secretly go to the 19th floor of the adjacent building.)

561
00:23:18,861 --> 00:23:21,070
- "Shush! This is a private..." - A talk in private?

562
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:22,800
- A talk in private? - What?

563
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:24,500
- Hold on. But... - Is it Se Seung?

564
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,040
Se Seung is cooking spicy braised chicken at home.

565
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:28,240
What's going on?

566
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,310
Is it Cho A?

567
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:31,111
- I don't think it's Se Seung. - Right.

568
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,810
Did she send the food via courier?

569
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:33,980
No way.

570
00:23:34,111 --> 00:23:35,451
So he can have it on the 19th floor.

571
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,651
It's an ocean in the countryside.

572
00:23:37,651 --> 00:23:39,121
- Where is it? - It's in Namhae.

573
00:23:39,121 --> 00:23:40,520
- Namhae. I've been there. - Yes.

574
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,951
- Namhae... - Namhae, South Gyeongsang Province.

575
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:44,391
I got a text message that made my heart flutter.

576
00:23:44,661 --> 00:23:46,260
It was so fun.

577
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:48,131
It was so heart-fluttering.

578
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:51,101
I wonder who it could be.

579
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:52,661
Namhae is really nice.

580
00:23:52,661 --> 00:23:54,431
- The ocean... - In Namhae,

581
00:23:54,431 --> 00:23:56,341
- there's the German Village. - There's the German Village.

582
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:59,171
I went to the German Village during Chuseok this year.

583
00:23:59,441 --> 00:24:01,040
I had a drink with my mom and my sibling.

584
00:24:01,411 --> 00:24:03,181
- Really? - Yes.

585
00:24:03,381 --> 00:24:05,280
(Taking something out)

586
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,911
(Meticulously securing a hand warmer)

587
00:24:06,911 --> 00:24:07,911
It's hot.

588
00:24:07,911 --> 00:24:09,550
I took care of it.

589
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,381
- Excuse me. - Sure.

590
00:24:11,381 --> 00:24:12,381
- Sure. - Sure.

591
00:24:21,891 --> 00:24:24,730
I wondered, "Who requested to see me in private?"

592
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:28,171
First of all, I didn't think it would be Se Seung.

593
00:24:28,171 --> 00:24:31,941
I already asked her out on a date.

594
00:24:32,101 --> 00:24:35,570
Then it meant it wasn't Se Seung. It had to be someone else.

595
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:38,280
"Who could it be? Cho A? Ju Yeon?"

596
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:40,780
"Cho A?"

597
00:24:57,901 --> 00:24:58,901
- Wait. - No?

598
00:24:58,901 --> 00:25:00,770
- Isn't that a new participant? - Isn't that Yun Ha?

599
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:01,800
- Yun Ha? - Wait.

600
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,970
- I think it's a new participant. - It's a new participant.

601
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:03,970
- What? Really? - Isn't that Yun Ha?

602
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,040
- That's Yun Ha's hairstyle. - Seriously.

603
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,611
- No! It's someone else! - Yun Ha...

604
00:25:27,431 --> 00:25:28,591
- Who is it? - It's someone else!

605
00:25:28,591 --> 00:25:29,661
- I knew it. - Who is it?

606
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,800
That was so sudden!

607
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,270
- Oh, my! - Why? Why so suddenly?

608
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,371
What? Who is it?

609
00:25:34,371 --> 00:25:35,701
- You must show us her entire face. - Wait.

610
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:36,800
- Who is it? - Don't tell me...

611
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,871
she's another sister.

612
00:25:37,871 --> 00:25:38,970
Isn't that Yun Ha?

613
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,070
Three siblings?

614
00:26:03,431 --> 00:26:04,931
- That's a new silhouette. - She's a new participant.

615
00:26:04,931 --> 00:26:06,161
- Who is it? A new participant? - No.

616
00:26:06,161 --> 00:26:07,631
- It's a new participant. - It's a new participant.

617
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:08,730
That was so sudden.

618
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:10,341
Excuse me. The camera is out of focus.

619
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,210
But that's Yun Ha's hairstyle.

620
00:26:14,441 --> 00:26:16,441
- Right. Yun Ha got a haircut. - Right.

621
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:18,780
It's a new participant.

622
00:26:19,381 --> 00:26:20,451
Gosh. I knew it.

623
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,230
(You have 10 minutes to talk to each of the 4 men.)

624
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:09,060
(After 10 minutes, you can choose to continue or stop the talk.)

625
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,960
(The total amount of time you have is limited to 60 minutes.)

626
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,861
(The first man will enter now.)

627
00:27:13,201 --> 00:27:15,431
I didn't see this coming at all.

628
00:27:15,431 --> 00:27:18,371
The moment I got the message, I got nervous.

629
00:27:18,671 --> 00:27:20,871
I thought this might be fun too.

630
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:24,381
The four of them will keep it a secret from each other...

631
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:27,611
- and talk to her for ten minutes. - What is this?

632
00:27:27,611 --> 00:27:28,710
That's right.

633
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:30,220
This is crazy. Seriously.

634
00:27:30,451 --> 00:27:32,381
This is a great chance for the new participant.

635
00:27:32,381 --> 00:27:34,990
Since she's moving in later than the others, she has a benefit.

636
00:27:47,431 --> 00:27:49,070
When I first walked in and looked at her,

637
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:50,441
I thought it was my sister.

638
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:54,470
She resembled my sister from the back.

639
00:27:55,611 --> 00:27:56,780
I thought it was silly.

640
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:58,210
"Why does she want to talk to me secretly?"

641
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:00,951
I sat down across from her while thinking that.

642
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,651
- Hello. - Hello.

643
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,121
- Hello. - Hello.

644
00:28:11,861 --> 00:28:13,161
- Hello. - Hello.

645
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:18,331
- Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

646
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,671
"Hold on. Then does this mean..."

647
00:28:20,831 --> 00:28:22,270
"there's a new participant?"

648
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:25,641
The whole situation was really fun. I mean it.

649
00:28:25,641 --> 00:28:26,710
Nice to meet you.

650
00:28:27,371 --> 00:28:29,671
My name is Ji Won.

651
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:31,240
- Ji Won? - Won. Yes.

652
00:28:31,941 --> 00:28:33,651
- What's your name? - My name?

653
00:28:34,581 --> 00:28:36,210
My name is Jung Sub.

654
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:37,250
Jung Sub.

655
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,181
- Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

656
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:41,320
You must be flustered.

657
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,921
Yes. Aren't you cold?

658
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,391
I'm all right.

659
00:28:44,391 --> 00:28:45,421
- You're not cold? - No.

660
00:28:45,421 --> 00:28:46,431
Here.

661
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:48,391
Thank you.

662
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:50,601
What were you doing before coming here?

663
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:51,760
We...

664
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:54,770
Hold on.

665
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:57,240
Take your time.

666
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,240
He's so cute.

667
00:29:00,641 --> 00:29:02,871
- He must be so flustered. - He must be shocked.

668
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,341
- It must be so awkward. - Oh, no.

669
00:29:04,341 --> 00:29:05,710
This came out of the blue. Seriously.

670
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:09,181
I was having dinner with the guys.

671
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:11,280
We had a drink.

672
00:29:12,081 --> 00:29:13,220
Hold on. Your name...

673
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,351
- Was it Ji Won? - Ji Won.

674
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,020
- Ji Won? - Yes.

675
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:22,030
I thought she was a foreigner at first.

676
00:29:22,161 --> 00:29:24,931
She had such distinct facial features.

677
00:29:25,331 --> 00:29:27,931
So I thought, "Gosh, she has strong facial features."

678
00:29:28,171 --> 00:29:30,270
She sort of resembles an actress.

679
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:32,570
She looks like a foreign actress.

680
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:34,240
Moni... Wait, no.

681
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,310
Was it Monica?

682
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,581
Anyway, she does resemble someone.

683
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:43,121
(The silence is suffocating.)

684
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,421
- What's this? - Gosh.

685
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,220
It was funny to watch him so flustered.

686
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,451
I was flustered too.

687
00:29:49,691 --> 00:29:51,891
But when I saw that he was more flustered than me,

688
00:29:51,891 --> 00:29:54,631
I was sort of relieved. That's how I felt.

689
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:56,931
It's awkward, right? It's awkward for me too.

690
00:29:56,931 --> 00:29:58,060
Why are you moving in so late?

691
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,431
- Me? Right. - Yes.

692
00:29:59,431 --> 00:30:01,000
When did you move into the house?

693
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,131
It's been a while for us.

694
00:30:02,131 --> 00:30:03,441
- A while? - Yes.

695
00:30:03,671 --> 00:30:06,070
- How long? - Our time there is almost over.

696
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,070
It's almost over?

697
00:30:07,411 --> 00:30:08,470
I'm in trouble.

698
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:10,941
Is today my only chance?

699
00:30:11,881 --> 00:30:13,351
But seriously. How many days has it been?

700
00:30:13,351 --> 00:30:15,851
You'll find out about it over time once you move in.

701
00:30:15,851 --> 00:30:17,320
- Over time? - You'll find out soon enough.

702
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:18,851
Did you prepare that for us?

703
00:30:19,081 --> 00:30:21,121
This? Yes. I prepared this for us.

704
00:30:21,121 --> 00:30:23,220
- Really? - I cut everything on this plate.

705
00:30:24,921 --> 00:30:26,391
- The drink... - You cut this?

706
00:30:27,431 --> 00:30:28,560
- I'm joking. - Really?

707
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:30,460
By the way, can you drink?

708
00:30:30,631 --> 00:30:33,300
It's totally fine with me. I was having a drink anyway.

709
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:35,201
- Should we have a drink? - Shall we?

710
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:37,171
Your name was Jung Sub, right?

711
00:30:37,171 --> 00:30:38,270
Yes. It's Jung Sub.

712
00:30:42,171 --> 00:30:43,181
Jung Sub.

713
00:30:45,911 --> 00:30:47,681
(There's another silence.)

714
00:30:47,911 --> 00:30:48,911
Hold on.

715
00:30:54,451 --> 00:30:55,790
What's going on?

716
00:30:55,921 --> 00:30:57,260
What should I ask you?

717
00:30:57,661 --> 00:30:59,391
Can I ask you what you do for a living?

718
00:30:59,391 --> 00:31:01,861
My job? We...

719
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:04,300
We did reveal that.

720
00:31:05,131 --> 00:31:06,161
Is it a secret?

721
00:31:06,161 --> 00:31:09,030
I don't want to tell you everything about me in our first meeting.

722
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:12,300
You're not telling me anything about yourself. Nothing at all.

723
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,341
You only told me your name so far.

724
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,270
Jung Sub.

725
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:17,980
- Jung Sub. - Yes. It's Jung Sub.

726
00:31:18,081 --> 00:31:19,111
Okay.

727
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,351
You weren't in the photo album yesterday.

728
00:31:21,951 --> 00:31:23,720
- A photo album? - Yes, there was a photo album.

729
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,720
(He teases her again.)

730
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,091
You're already clearly drawing the line between us.

731
00:31:28,651 --> 00:31:29,960
I'll tell you what we did yesterday.

732
00:31:30,161 --> 00:31:34,691
Yesterday, all of us looked through a photo album which had photos...

733
00:31:34,831 --> 00:31:36,560
of our childhood.

734
00:31:37,661 --> 00:31:38,661
That must've been fun.

735
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,070
It really was fun.

736
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:42,000
Why are you moving in so late?

737
00:31:42,101 --> 00:31:43,101
I was working.

738
00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:44,101
- You were working? - Yes.

739
00:31:44,101 --> 00:31:45,171
What do you do for a living?

740
00:31:45,171 --> 00:31:47,611
I work in the entertainment business.

741
00:31:47,611 --> 00:31:49,240
I oversee artists' development.

742
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,341
- In the entertainment business? - Yes.

743
00:31:54,081 --> 00:31:56,681
I work in the entertainment business.

744
00:31:57,550 --> 00:32:00,591
I work in the Artist Development Department.

745
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:05,820
Overall, the melody instruments sound pretty weak.

746
00:32:06,121 --> 00:32:08,361
I think you moved forward too much.

747
00:32:08,631 --> 00:32:11,401
You shouldn't put it in the middle. People can't see it then.

748
00:32:12,161 --> 00:32:15,631
First of all, I love music.

749
00:32:15,901 --> 00:32:17,701
I find joy in supporting other people...

750
00:32:18,101 --> 00:32:22,570
and helping them shine. That brings me happiness.

751
00:32:22,871 --> 00:32:24,841
So I started out as a manager.

752
00:32:24,841 --> 00:32:27,280
I worked as a manager for over two years.

753
00:32:27,451 --> 00:32:31,951
Now, I started working on developing artists which had been my dream.

754
00:32:32,081 --> 00:32:34,121
I started to grow my career on this path.

755
00:32:34,451 --> 00:32:38,191
(Ji Won, the team leader of Artists and Repertoire)

756
00:32:38,421 --> 00:32:41,560
So you oversee their development. What do you develop?

757
00:32:41,691 --> 00:32:43,060
Do you develop everything?

758
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:46,931
I help my artists produce albums.

759
00:32:47,101 --> 00:32:48,201
Artists as in musicians?

760
00:32:48,201 --> 00:32:50,800
- Yes. That's my department. - I see.

761
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:54,411
When she explained about her job,

762
00:32:54,611 --> 00:32:56,841
she was very calm.

763
00:32:56,841 --> 00:32:59,810
Her calmness was different from Cho A's calm vibe.

764
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:02,181
I thought, "I didn't know she could be this calm."

765
00:33:02,411 --> 00:33:03,451
"How interesting."

766
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:05,451
- Do you like to cook? - I do.

767
00:33:05,451 --> 00:33:07,320
- Really? - But I'm not good at it.

768
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:09,290
- I like cooking too. - Are you good at it?

769
00:33:09,651 --> 00:33:11,720
But I didn't get a chance to cook a proper meal here.

770
00:33:11,921 --> 00:33:13,220
What kind of food can you cook well?

771
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:15,960
- I want to try cooking pasta. - Pasta.

772
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,260
I can grill some steak too.

773
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,861
I'll enjoy that.

774
00:33:21,131 --> 00:33:24,070
When I talked to Jung Sub, it was clear that...

775
00:33:24,171 --> 00:33:26,101
he was good...

776
00:33:26,101 --> 00:33:27,671
at making his conversation partner feel at ease.

777
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:31,210
I thought we would be able to bond while living together.

778
00:33:31,341 --> 00:33:33,581
I think I felt less nervous...

779
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:36,881
because Jung Sub was the first guy I talked to.

780
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:38,750
- Cooking aglio e olio is hard. - Is it?

781
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,151
You need cooking oil for that.

782
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:41,451
Did you get a call?

783
00:33:41,451 --> 00:33:42,921
- I got a message. - Is that so?

784
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,520
(10 minutes have passed.)

785
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,591
(Will you continue your conversation with Jung Sub?)

786
00:33:45,591 --> 00:33:46,661
(You now have 50 minutes left.)

787
00:33:47,891 --> 00:33:49,431
She must decide whether to continue it or not.

788
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,431
Deciding whether to continue it or not...

789
00:33:51,431 --> 00:33:52,861
It looks like she won't do it, right?

790
00:33:52,861 --> 00:33:54,000
- I don't think she will. - I think she will.

791
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,171
- I think she will. - I think she will.

792
00:33:55,171 --> 00:33:56,530
- No, I don't think she will. - I don't think so.

793
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:58,670
I could tell earlier that she liked him.

794
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:01,070
- I don't think she'll continue. - This is her first day.

795
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:03,711
I think she has to meet as many men as possible.

796
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:05,411
They'll text Jung Sub now.

797
00:34:05,411 --> 00:34:06,440
"Come out."

798
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:09,181
"Go back to the bar where the guys are."

799
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,780
(10 minutes have passed.)

800
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,251
(Will you continue your conversation with Jung Sub?)

801
00:34:12,251 --> 00:34:13,650
(You now have 50 minutes left.)

802
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,360
(Ji Won texts back without hesitation.)

803
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:21,190
(And Jung Sub is clueless.)

804
00:34:23,961 --> 00:34:25,501
(She's done responding to the message.)

805
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:28,470
So you should cook aglio e olio for us one day.

806
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:29,970
(She goes back to talking about aglio e olio.)

807
00:34:29,970 --> 00:34:31,371
I'll try cooking it.

808
00:34:32,041 --> 00:34:33,340
- I'll cook it one day. - I'll look forward to it.

809
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,440
You can.

810
00:34:35,411 --> 00:34:36,440
Excuse me.

811
00:34:37,081 --> 00:34:40,181
(The secret conversation is over. Please leave the bar.)

812
00:34:40,181 --> 00:34:41,181
It's over.

813
00:34:41,911 --> 00:34:43,920
- I told you. - For real?

814
00:34:44,621 --> 00:34:46,351
What is this?

815
00:34:46,351 --> 00:34:48,190
- I feel bad for him. - "Please leave the bar."

816
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:49,490
Isn't that too mean?

817
00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:51,190
They tried to be as polite as possible.

818
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:54,791
I don't think that means she didn't like him.

819
00:34:54,791 --> 00:34:56,030
- Right. - Of course not.

820
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:59,130
That makes me curious, though.

821
00:34:59,961 --> 00:35:01,501
(The secret conversation is over. Please leave the bar.)

822
00:35:01,501 --> 00:35:02,931
(The secret conversation is over. Please leave the bar.)

823
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:07,570
Our allotted time...

824
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:11,081
for conversation is up here.

825
00:35:11,081 --> 00:35:12,141
It's a shame.

826
00:35:12,311 --> 00:35:13,981
I'll see you there.

827
00:35:18,451 --> 00:35:21,320
I felt like we talked for like five minutes.

828
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,320
It was such a short conversation.

829
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,021
It was my first time meeting her,

830
00:35:25,021 --> 00:35:27,161
and in terms of looks,

831
00:35:27,161 --> 00:35:30,130
she gave off such a different vibe.

832
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:33,731
She was really chill and calm too.

833
00:35:33,731 --> 00:35:36,070
I liked her at first sight...

834
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:39,771
because of the vibe her looks gave off.

835
00:35:39,771 --> 00:35:42,570
Anyway, it was an impressive encounter...

836
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:44,610
in many ways.

837
00:35:45,581 --> 00:35:46,981
It was a good stimulus.

838
00:35:48,251 --> 00:35:50,220
I'm going to go now. See you later.

839
00:35:53,121 --> 00:35:56,351
(Ji Won and Jung Sub's secret conversation has ended.)

840
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,891
I felt like I figured him out...

841
00:36:00,891 --> 00:36:03,231
from the vibe I first got from him.

842
00:36:03,231 --> 00:36:05,161
He seemed too flustered.

843
00:36:05,161 --> 00:36:08,800
He seemed to be struggling more than I was.

844
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,641
I was mostly thinking that I should send home quickly.

845
00:36:12,641 --> 00:36:15,670
That's why I didn't extend the time.

846
00:36:15,771 --> 00:36:18,940
(Meanwhile, the men have no idea.)

847
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:21,681
Where is Jung Sub, though?

848
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,451
I know. Where is he?

849
00:36:23,451 --> 00:36:25,081
Did he get lost on his way?

850
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,351
I hope he brings ice cream as a surprise.

851
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,690
(Coming back empty-handed)

852
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:36,590
You're back.

853
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:38,300
I almost called the police...

854
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,400
- I'm sorry. - to report you missing.

855
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,831
- Where is ice cream? - I'm so sorry.

856
00:36:42,831 --> 00:36:44,541
- Were you on the phone? - What happened?

857
00:36:44,541 --> 00:36:45,541
I had a stomach ache.

858
00:36:45,541 --> 00:36:46,800
- An upset stomach? - Yes.

859
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,411
- Are you okay? - I'm good now.

860
00:36:49,411 --> 00:36:51,380
You look pale now.

861
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:52,981
Take it easy.

862
00:36:52,981 --> 00:36:55,550
The bathroom outside was too cold.

863
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:56,981
(I see.)

864
00:36:56,981 --> 00:36:58,280
I thought something happened to him...

865
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,420
or he had an upset stomach.

866
00:37:00,621 --> 00:37:03,190
- What were you talking about? - We weren't talking.

867
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,190
We almost reported you missing.

868
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,590
I'm so sorry.

869
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:10,030
- Promise not to do it again. - I promise.

870
00:37:11,101 --> 00:37:12,231
So you feel better now, right?

871
00:37:12,231 --> 00:37:14,130
Yes. I feel much better.

872
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:15,431
(Successfully overcoming the crisis)

873
00:37:18,641 --> 00:37:20,641
(Shush! This is a private message only for you.)

874
00:37:20,641 --> 00:37:22,411
(A female participant requests to talk to you in private.)

875
00:37:22,411 --> 00:37:24,211
(Tell the guys you're going to the bathroom...)

876
00:37:24,211 --> 00:37:25,911
(and secretly go to the 19th floor of the adjacent building.)

877
00:37:29,211 --> 00:37:30,451
I was holding it this way.

878
00:37:30,451 --> 00:37:31,550
- This way? - Right.

879
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:32,581
I thought it was the other way.

880
00:37:32,581 --> 00:37:34,021
- No, it was like this. - Like this.

881
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:37,190
(He's busy alone.)

882
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:40,931
- Let me go to the bathroom. - Yes, go ahead.

883
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,101
That's cute.

884
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,630
It's so obvious.

885
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:48,101
He picked it up.

886
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:49,800
- Look at his face. - He knows what's going on.

887
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,300
- Look at his face. - "Here it comes."

888
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,711
- This is so much fun. - This is killing me.

889
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:57,541
- Let me go to the bathroom. - Yes, go ahead.

890
00:37:59,311 --> 00:38:01,411
Jae Hyung was obviously awkward.

891
00:38:01,411 --> 00:38:04,650
When he said, "Let me use the bathroom,"

892
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,150
it was so awkward and unnatural.

893
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:09,720
I thought he was going to meet her too...

894
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,961
and wondered what kind of conversation they'd have.

895
00:38:11,961 --> 00:38:15,461
I think Ji Won's sibling could be Jae Hyung.

896
00:38:16,231 --> 00:38:18,630
They look similar in a way.

897
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:21,070
I thought the crew also sent Jae Hyung...

898
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:22,771
to confuse us.

899
00:38:22,771 --> 00:38:27,110
Jae Hyung has strong facial features.

900
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:30,110
Since she also did,

901
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:32,440
I thought they had similar vibes.

902
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:36,150
Did you really have an upset stomach?

903
00:38:36,451 --> 00:38:38,050
- Yes. - Okay.

904
00:38:38,851 --> 00:38:40,220
Okay, what?

905
00:38:52,331 --> 00:38:54,101
(Entering the building carefully)

906
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:10,380
When I only saw her from the side and the back,

907
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:13,621
I thought it was Yun Ha because of the hairstyle.

908
00:39:13,621 --> 00:39:16,220
I never thought it could be someone new.

909
00:39:17,661 --> 00:39:19,190
Hello.

910
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:24,161
- Hello. - Hello.

911
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:26,061
Nice to meet you.

912
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:29,570
My name is Ji Won.

913
00:39:30,331 --> 00:39:32,141
- Ji Won? - Yes.

914
00:39:32,141 --> 00:39:34,340
- What's your name? - Jae Hyung.

915
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:35,871
My name is Jae Hyung.

916
00:39:35,871 --> 00:39:37,541
- Jae Hyung? - Yes.

917
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:38,581
Happy to meet you.

918
00:39:41,081 --> 00:39:42,110
Who are you?

919
00:39:45,751 --> 00:39:48,521
- "Who are you?" - "Who are you?"

920
00:39:48,521 --> 00:39:50,521
- "Who are you?" - "Who are you?"

921
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:52,461
Who are you?

922
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:54,990
Who... Oh, dear.

923
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:58,161
- Well, I arrived today. - I see.

924
00:39:59,601 --> 00:40:00,630
She's moving in.

925
00:40:01,731 --> 00:40:03,331
Someone new is moving in.

926
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,001
I see.

927
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:10,371
I heard you were having a meal.

928
00:40:10,371 --> 00:40:11,481
Yes.

929
00:40:11,911 --> 00:40:13,041
Have you eaten?

930
00:40:13,041 --> 00:40:15,251
Yes, I have.

931
00:40:16,451 --> 00:40:17,851
My first impression of her was intense.

932
00:40:17,851 --> 00:40:21,490
She had smoky eye makeup on,

933
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:25,161
and the tone of her voice sounded quite serious.

934
00:40:25,161 --> 00:40:28,490
Also, her outfit looked a little hip.

935
00:40:31,001 --> 00:40:32,431
You must be thrown off.

936
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,170
Well, yes.

937
00:40:35,931 --> 00:40:38,101
- It's a little fun, though. - Really?

938
00:40:38,501 --> 00:40:39,701
(Becoming serious)

939
00:40:39,701 --> 00:40:41,271
- Shall we toast? - Shall we?

940
00:40:43,371 --> 00:40:44,411
Is this wine?

941
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:46,041
Yes, white wine.

942
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:48,751
I feel like I'm pretending to be elegant.

943
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:53,621
Do you like wine?

944
00:40:53,621 --> 00:40:55,021
Yes, I do.

945
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,650
Can you hold your liquor?

946
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:59,461
I enjoy drinking, but I can't drink a lot.

947
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:01,461
Do you enjoy drinking?

948
00:41:01,461 --> 00:41:03,360
I do enjoy it too.

949
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,831
I see. What's your favourite drink?

950
00:41:05,831 --> 00:41:07,731
My favourite is soju.

951
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:09,170
- Do you like soju? - Yes.

952
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:12,300
You're the first person I've met who said they liked soju.

953
00:41:13,271 --> 00:41:15,340
- Have some. - What is it? Jerky?

954
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:16,670
Yes.

955
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,050
It's so good.

956
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:22,811
- Have you tried it? - I have.

957
00:41:22,811 --> 00:41:23,820
You did.

958
00:41:24,451 --> 00:41:26,780
Am I the first participant you met?

959
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:29,391
- I met Jung Sub earlier. - You met Jung Sub?

960
00:41:29,391 --> 00:41:30,791
Yes. Jung Sub.

961
00:41:30,791 --> 00:41:32,461
So...

962
00:41:32,461 --> 00:41:35,431
who is the woman you want to be the closest to?

963
00:41:35,561 --> 00:41:36,590
Do I have to name her?

964
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:39,530
- I will just say there is one. - What?

965
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:41,470
I'll just say there's someone I want to be close to.

966
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:42,530
Okay.

967
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:43,601
(Brother-in-law Hunter wonders who it could be.)

968
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,501
(Cheol Hyeon suddenly leaves.)

969
00:41:46,141 --> 00:41:48,110
- Now only the two of us are left. - Yes.

970
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:49,911
So why don't you drop me a hint?

971
00:41:50,141 --> 00:41:53,081
Jung Sub, you might know who she is.

972
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:54,711
- What? - You might know...

973
00:41:54,711 --> 00:41:56,451
- even without a hint. - I don't think so.

974
00:41:56,451 --> 00:41:57,780
- You don't? - I have no idea.

975
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:58,820
(They don't back down.)

976
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,650
(Cheol Hyeon returns quickly.)

977
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,791
(Quiet)

978
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:06,320
(Jung Sub couldn't figure it out in the end.)

979
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,391
Did you all get closer?

980
00:42:08,391 --> 00:42:11,300
At least, the men are quite close.

981
00:42:12,431 --> 00:42:14,331
Some of us...

982
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:17,240
are close to the women, and some are not.

983
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:20,711
It hasn't been that long since we moved in.

984
00:42:20,711 --> 00:42:21,871
She must feel thankful...

985
00:42:21,871 --> 00:42:23,041
- for him to say that. - Right.

986
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:25,141
- It will put her at ease. - Yes.

987
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:26,541
Are you a good cook?

988
00:42:26,541 --> 00:42:28,010
- Making food? - Making food?

989
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:30,081
- I'm good at making food. - As in meal kits?

990
00:42:30,081 --> 00:42:32,081
Yes. I'm an amazing meal kit cook.

991
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:34,391
Are you good at cooking?

992
00:42:34,391 --> 00:42:37,320
No, but I like cooking.

993
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,860
When I cook, it's edible.

994
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:42,990
I'm better at making Korean food...

995
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:44,201
than Western food.

996
00:42:44,201 --> 00:42:46,030
- Is Korean food your favourite? - Yes.

997
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:48,771
- Is it your favourite cuisine? - Korean food is my favourite.

998
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,070
(10 minutes have passed.)

999
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:52,440
(Will you continue your conversation with Jae Hyung?)

1000
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,911
(You now have 40 minutes left.)

1001
00:42:54,141 --> 00:42:56,911
In that situation, she would extend the time...

1002
00:42:56,911 --> 00:42:59,041
- because she feels comfortable. - Right.

1003
00:42:59,041 --> 00:43:01,851
Also, she's smiling a lot more than when she was with Jung Sub.

1004
00:43:01,851 --> 00:43:03,711
- I don't think she would extend it. - Extend it.

1005
00:43:04,621 --> 00:43:05,981
(10 minutes have passed.)

1006
00:43:05,981 --> 00:43:07,351
(Will you continue your conversation with Jae Hyung?)

1007
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:08,650
(You now have 40 minutes left.)

1008
00:43:10,661 --> 00:43:12,920
What's your favourite food?

1009
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,030
I like meat.

1010
00:43:14,391 --> 00:43:16,461
Is there a specific cut you prefer...

1011
00:43:16,461 --> 00:43:18,331
like pork belly?

1012
00:43:18,331 --> 00:43:20,161
- I love beef the most. - Beef.

1013
00:43:20,161 --> 00:43:21,731
Yes. I like pork too.

1014
00:43:21,931 --> 00:43:23,130
I'm also good at grilling meat.

1015
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:24,641
You are?

1016
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,470
Yes.

1017
00:43:27,711 --> 00:43:29,211
(The secret conversation is over. Please leave the bar.)

1018
00:43:29,211 --> 00:43:30,780
(The secret conversation is over. Please leave the bar.)

1019
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,311
They told me to leave.

1020
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,050
- Why is he just sitting there? - He's saying that...

1021
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:40,320
to the person who made him leave.

1022
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:43,590
I like that he's frank.

1023
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:45,190
Gosh, Jae Hyung.

1024
00:43:49,731 --> 00:43:50,800
They told me to leave.

1025
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:51,860
(Ji Won didn't continue her conversation with Jae Hyung.)

1026
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:54,570
They did? I guess time is up.

1027
00:43:57,940 --> 00:43:59,871
- I'll see you later. - See you.

1028
00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:03,340
I wondered why the conversation was too short.

1029
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:07,211
(Ji Won and Jae Hyung's secret conversation has ended.)

1030
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:12,121
Jae Hyung is the person who got me flustered the most.

1031
00:44:12,121 --> 00:44:14,320
It made me miss Jung Sub a little.

1032
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,720
Jae Hyung...

1033
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:18,820
seemed like a free spirit.

1034
00:44:19,561 --> 00:44:24,030
I saw a lot of similarities...

1035
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:27,260
between him and the men I had dated.

1036
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:29,400
His carefree nature...

1037
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:33,201
made me think we were different.

1038
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:34,740
When I first saw Ji Won,

1039
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:36,541
I was a little startled.

1040
00:44:36,871 --> 00:44:39,240
Her hairstyle,

1041
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:42,280
outfit, and makeup...

1042
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,720
reminded me a lot of my ex-girlfriend.

1043
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:48,150
It made me remember...

1044
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:52,291
the unpleasant memories...

1045
00:44:52,521 --> 00:44:55,590
from my past relationship.

1046
00:44:55,590 --> 00:44:57,461
With those memories overlapping our conversation...

1047
00:44:57,630 --> 00:44:59,331
I wouldn't say I didn't like our encounter,

1048
00:44:59,331 --> 00:45:01,431
but those memories just occurred to me.

1049
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:05,470
So it made me feel emotionally closed off.

1050
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:06,670
That's how I felt.

1051
00:45:07,911 --> 00:45:10,470
- At the first encounter? - That changes things, then.

1052
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:13,110
They would never end up together.

1053
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:16,110
How can they both see their exes in complete strangers?

1054
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:18,021
- That's possible. - Were they too hurt?

1055
00:45:18,021 --> 00:45:19,521
- There's no chance between them. - But it might...

1056
00:45:19,521 --> 00:45:22,021
rather make them attracted to each other more.

1057
00:45:22,021 --> 00:45:24,621
- What? - As they spend time together.

1058
00:45:24,621 --> 00:45:25,690
- Really? - Yes.

1059
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:26,820
That can happen.

1060
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:29,561
It's fascinating how they thought the same thing.

1061
00:45:29,561 --> 00:45:31,630
- It really is. - At the same time.

1062
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,880
(Trying to keep a straight face)

1063
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,010
You're back.

1064
00:45:48,751 --> 00:45:49,780
Is it cold outside?

1065
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:52,181
Yes. They said my mic was weird.

1066
00:45:52,181 --> 00:45:53,220
- I see. - Right.

1067
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,391
Gosh!

1068
00:45:58,720 --> 00:45:59,720
(He can't hold his laughter.)

1069
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:02,530
Jae Hyung's unique way of handling things...

1070
00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:04,760
seemed to backfire.

1071
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:06,001
He was overacting.

1072
00:46:06,001 --> 00:46:08,601
I wondered if he was acting like that on purpose...

1073
00:46:08,601 --> 00:46:10,271
after meeting his own sibling.

1074
00:46:10,731 --> 00:46:13,240
(The house in Seorae Village)

1075
00:46:15,311 --> 00:46:17,240
(Yun Ha returns home.)

1076
00:46:18,411 --> 00:46:20,780
- Hello. - Who is it?

1077
00:46:21,481 --> 00:46:22,981
It's Yun Ha.

1078
00:46:22,981 --> 00:46:24,320
Are you alone?

1079
00:46:26,981 --> 00:46:28,951
- Were you bored? - I'm alone.

1080
00:46:28,951 --> 00:46:30,121
- Really? - Yes.

1081
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:31,860
You must've been bored.

1082
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:33,990
I'll make something delicious for you.

1083
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:37,331
- You'll eat now, right? - Yes.

1084
00:46:37,601 --> 00:46:39,760
Did we finish the perilla leaves?

1085
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,371
- I think so. - We did?

1086
00:46:43,271 --> 00:46:45,001
It's quite bland.

1087
00:46:45,001 --> 00:46:47,170
- Bland foods are healthy. - It's a little bland.

1088
00:46:49,070 --> 00:46:51,081
- Is it good? - It's tasty.

1089
00:46:51,081 --> 00:46:52,181
- Really? - Yes.

1090
00:46:52,541 --> 00:46:54,811
It's not bland.

1091
00:46:54,811 --> 00:46:56,181
- For real? - Yes.

1092
00:46:56,451 --> 00:46:57,451
I'm glad.

1093
00:46:57,451 --> 00:46:59,851
Do you know where the men went?

1094
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:02,451
No. Only they know.

1095
00:47:02,521 --> 00:47:03,550
I see.

1096
00:47:03,550 --> 00:47:05,190
It's their own secret.

1097
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,731
What time will everyone be back?

1098
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:14,371
- But it was so... - You got a message.

1099
00:47:15,931 --> 00:47:17,601
(Shush! This is a private message only for you.)

1100
00:47:17,601 --> 00:47:18,871
(A female participant requests to talk to you in private.)

1101
00:47:18,871 --> 00:47:20,141
(Tell the guys you're going to the bathroom...)

1102
00:47:20,141 --> 00:47:21,610
(and secretly go to the 19th floor of the adjacent building.)

1103
00:47:21,610 --> 00:47:24,110
I wondered who it could be for a moment.

1104
00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:26,541
I didn't think it was Ju Yeon.

1105
00:47:26,541 --> 00:47:28,681
I thought it'd be Se Seung.

1106
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,811
- Cheol Hyeon, go! - Cheol Hyeon is coming.

1107
00:47:30,811 --> 00:47:31,981
This is your chance to turn the tables.

1108
00:47:31,981 --> 00:47:34,391
- Things are going well for him. - This is fun.

1109
00:47:34,391 --> 00:47:37,050
They don't expect to have a new participant at all.

1110
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:41,860
I...

1111
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:43,490
- Go ahead. - Yes. Go ahead.

1112
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:46,731
(Cheol Hyeon leaves.)

1113
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,331
I want to go to the bathroom too.

1114
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:53,070
(Yong Woo also leaves.)

1115
00:47:56,570 --> 00:47:57,610
You've been there, right?

1116
00:47:57,811 --> 00:47:59,211
I don't know what you mean.

1117
00:47:59,211 --> 00:48:00,811
We both went there.

1118
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:02,280
I went to the bathroom.

1119
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:03,280
(Laughing)

1120
00:48:04,010 --> 00:48:05,681
(Avoiding eye contact)

1121
00:48:06,951 --> 00:48:08,891
(Checking outside again)

1122
00:48:08,891 --> 00:48:12,190
There's always something every day.

1123
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:13,220
Every single day.

1124
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:15,931
It's better to stay alert.

1125
00:48:16,061 --> 00:48:17,061
Right.

1126
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:19,331
(Closing his mouth shut)

1127
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:22,931
It's so close, right? It's right here.

1128
00:48:22,931 --> 00:48:24,271
- Yes. - The bathroom.

1129
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:26,371
(Meanwhile, Cheol Hyeon)

1130
00:48:28,871 --> 00:48:30,911
(This is the entrance.)

1131
00:48:34,911 --> 00:48:37,650
(Thankfully, he found the building.)

1132
00:48:44,561 --> 00:48:46,661
When I went into the bar,

1133
00:48:46,661 --> 00:48:49,030
I thought it was Yun Ha from a distance.

1134
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:51,130
"Is it Yun Ha? She looks like her from the side."

1135
00:48:51,331 --> 00:48:53,501
"Yun Ha wanted to see me."

1136
00:48:54,001 --> 00:48:56,501
"Why did she request to see me?"

1137
00:48:56,501 --> 00:48:58,871
"We barely talked."

1138
00:48:59,101 --> 00:49:01,240
"Okay. Let me take this opportunity to have a talk with her."

1139
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:02,541
That's what I was thinking, going in.

1140
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:04,380
As I got close to her,

1141
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:06,141
- I realized she wasn't Yun Ha. - Hello.

1142
00:49:06,141 --> 00:49:08,681
- Hello. - Glad to meet you.

1143
00:49:08,681 --> 00:49:10,211
Nice to meet you.

1144
00:49:10,351 --> 00:49:12,320
My name is JI Won.

1145
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:13,920
- Ji Won? - Yes.

1146
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,090
- My name is Cheol Hyeon. - Cheol Hyeon?

1147
00:49:16,090 --> 00:49:18,490
- Cheol Hyeon. - Cheol Hyeon? Good to meet you.

1148
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:19,521
Nice to meet you.

1149
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,931
I thought she was hip.

1150
00:49:21,931 --> 00:49:23,331
She seemed hip.

1151
00:49:23,331 --> 00:49:24,860
She seemed fashionable.

1152
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:27,061
I thought we could have a lot...

1153
00:49:27,061 --> 00:49:29,170
to talk about in that sense.

1154
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:31,400
When I first saw Cheol Hyeon,

1155
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:33,641
I thought his bob hairstyle was stylish.

1156
00:49:33,641 --> 00:49:36,010
"I'm glad I don't have a bob haircut."

1157
00:49:36,170 --> 00:49:39,010
I thought that because it really suited him.

1158
00:49:39,211 --> 00:49:42,181
I was like, "I would have lost."

1159
00:49:42,411 --> 00:49:43,451
I see.

1160
00:49:43,451 --> 00:49:47,791
You don't seem too confused.

1161
00:49:47,791 --> 00:49:50,150
- I'm very confused. - Is that so?

1162
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:51,391
You barely touched this.

1163
00:49:51,391 --> 00:49:53,690
No. I had some.

1164
00:49:56,431 --> 00:49:58,601
You're wearing the same colour as I am.

1165
00:49:59,061 --> 00:50:01,231
- That's true. It's similar. - Right?

1166
00:50:02,771 --> 00:50:04,970
- But your outfit looks warmer. - Is that so?

1167
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:06,400
Aren't you cold?

1168
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,240
I'm good. What about you?

1169
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,470
I feel so warm.

1170
00:50:10,670 --> 00:50:13,141
- I'm wearing lots of layers inside. - Lots of layers.

1171
00:50:15,110 --> 00:50:16,650
Did you adjust well?

1172
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:20,050
Yes. Everyone is so nice.

1173
00:50:24,961 --> 00:50:26,320
I have a good feeling about them.

1174
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:27,760
He looked at her while taking a sip.

1175
00:50:27,931 --> 00:50:31,561
We have plenty of time, so let's enjoy ourselves.

1176
00:50:31,561 --> 00:50:32,800
Are you going to stay with us?

1177
00:50:33,161 --> 00:50:34,231
Then...

1178
00:50:34,831 --> 00:50:36,800
Then why would I be here?

1179
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:40,170
Did you think I would leave after seeing you?

1180
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:42,110
- I was curious. - I see.

1181
00:50:42,110 --> 00:50:44,170
Were you wondering who I was?

1182
00:50:44,170 --> 00:50:46,211
- Yes. - I get it.

1183
00:50:46,211 --> 00:50:48,251
- Right. - I'm moving into the house...

1184
00:50:48,251 --> 00:50:51,451
- I'm glad to have you. - to stay with you guys today.

1185
00:50:51,451 --> 00:50:53,251
- Nice to meet you. - Happy to meet you.

1186
00:50:53,251 --> 00:50:55,391
- Please take good care of me. - Me too.

1187
00:50:57,291 --> 00:50:59,760
Oh, my!

1188
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:00,820
(Exclaiming 3 times)

1189
00:51:05,331 --> 00:51:06,931
Are there any sports you enjoy?

1190
00:51:06,931 --> 00:51:09,231
- Badminton and tennis. - Tennis.

1191
00:51:09,231 --> 00:51:10,470
- I enjoy bowling too. - How about soccer?

1192
00:51:10,470 --> 00:51:12,070
We went bowling two days ago.

1193
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:13,101
- You did? - Yes.

1194
00:51:13,101 --> 00:51:15,411
It depends on the day.

1195
00:51:15,411 --> 00:51:16,740
When it goes bad,

1196
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,541
- it goes bad until the end. - Right.

1197
00:51:18,541 --> 00:51:20,780
When I get a strike, I'm on a strike streak.

1198
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:22,681
- I totally get that. - So...

1199
00:51:22,681 --> 00:51:25,181
- I think you got a message. - Let me see.

1200
00:51:25,451 --> 00:51:26,880
(10 minutes have passed.)

1201
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,420
(Will you continue your conversation with Cheol Hyeon?)

1202
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:29,720
(You now have 30 minutes left.)

1203
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:32,961
It looks like all of you got quite close.

1204
00:51:33,521 --> 00:51:35,931
I'll adjust quickly too, right?

1205
00:51:36,331 --> 00:51:37,431
I'll help you along.

1206
00:51:37,431 --> 00:51:39,030
Thanks.

1207
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:42,630
He had lots of questions.

1208
00:51:42,630 --> 00:51:45,940
Cheol Hyeon asked me so many questions...

1209
00:51:46,141 --> 00:51:51,010
that ten minutes passed the fastest when I was with him.

1210
00:51:51,010 --> 00:51:53,911
(Ji Won extended her time with Cheol Hyeon.)

1211
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:55,811
- She extended the time! - Good job.

1212
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:57,681
That was the right move.

1213
00:51:57,681 --> 00:51:59,251
- You should ask lots of questions. - That went well.

1214
00:51:59,251 --> 00:52:02,251
- I knew they would hit it off. - Right.

1215
00:52:02,251 --> 00:52:04,320
- They have similar tones of voice. - They're similar.

1216
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:09,190
Ji Won is an attentive listener.

1217
00:52:09,190 --> 00:52:12,331
Our conversations went well. I'm curious about her.

1218
00:52:12,331 --> 00:52:14,360
It seems she's interested in fashion.

1219
00:52:14,470 --> 00:52:15,771
That's the impression I had.

1220
00:52:16,101 --> 00:52:17,501
I think we'd get along well.

1221
00:52:18,271 --> 00:52:21,340
She left a good first impression.

1222
00:52:22,271 --> 00:52:25,380
(The conversation between the 2 lasted for an extra 10 minutes.)

1223
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:27,951
Shall we take a picture?

1224
00:52:27,951 --> 00:52:28,981
- Sure. - Sorry?

1225
00:52:28,981 --> 00:52:30,650
- Let's take a picture. - Let's do it.

1226
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:33,150
- Should we take a photo like this? - Did you bring the Polaroid camera?

1227
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:35,251
- This angle would be better. - What?

1228
00:52:35,650 --> 00:52:36,650
It's so random.

1229
00:52:38,161 --> 00:52:39,360
In 1, 2, 3.

1230
00:52:41,021 --> 00:52:42,061
Done.

1231
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:44,291
My mouth is twitching.

1232
00:52:44,561 --> 00:52:47,101
Cheol Hyeon took longer to come back...

1233
00:52:47,101 --> 00:52:48,701
than I had thought.

1234
00:52:48,701 --> 00:52:50,400
"What? He's taking a very long time."

1235
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,501
"They're talking for a really long time."

1236
00:52:52,501 --> 00:52:53,541
That's what I thought.

1237
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:56,411
You have a stylish hairstyle.

1238
00:52:56,411 --> 00:52:57,411
- I do? - You look better with a bob...

1239
00:52:57,411 --> 00:52:58,811
than women do.

1240
00:52:58,811 --> 00:53:00,711
I'm not that good at styling my hair.

1241
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:03,851
How do I look today? Do you think it's done nicely?

1242
00:53:03,851 --> 00:53:06,251
- Yes, it is. - Is it okay? Is it not flat?

1243
00:53:06,251 --> 00:53:07,820
It's voluminous.

1244
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:09,320
- It is? - Yes. I think it's done nicely.

1245
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:12,190
Has someone other than me visited you before?

1246
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:13,391
Yes.

1247
00:53:13,391 --> 00:53:16,590
I talked with 2 people 1st.

1248
00:53:16,590 --> 00:53:17,900
You're the third.

1249
00:53:18,201 --> 00:53:22,130
I think I was given a chance to talk to everyone...

1250
00:53:22,431 --> 00:53:24,231
as I came late.

1251
00:53:24,231 --> 00:53:26,041
What is it like living in the house?

1252
00:53:26,201 --> 00:53:27,570
They're nice people. It's great.

1253
00:53:27,570 --> 00:53:29,510
You'll feel it immediately when you come to the house.

1254
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:30,911
You'll know they're good people.

1255
00:53:30,911 --> 00:53:32,780
- I can feel it. - Is that so? That's great.

1256
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:35,050
It seems you really like people.

1257
00:53:35,050 --> 00:53:36,550
- Right? - I think so.

1258
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:39,380
I've been thinking that a lot since I moved in.

1259
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:42,590
I love people.

1260
00:53:42,590 --> 00:53:44,420
- I see. - I'm sad when each day passes.

1261
00:53:45,021 --> 00:53:46,061
That's nice.

1262
00:53:47,021 --> 00:53:51,161
- I do think I'm different... - I see.

1263
00:53:51,161 --> 00:53:52,360
when I work and when I don't.

1264
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:53,800
(10 minutes have passed.)

1265
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,300
(Will you continue your conversation with Cheol Hyeon?)

1266
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:56,931
(You now have 20 minutes left.)

1267
00:53:58,170 --> 00:53:59,201
(The secret conversation is over. Please leave the bar.)

1268
00:53:59,201 --> 00:54:00,300
(The secret conversation is over. Please leave the bar.)

1269
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:01,541
It's over for me now.

1270
00:54:01,541 --> 00:54:03,840
- I see. - Let's drink one last time.

1271
00:54:04,311 --> 00:54:05,481
See you in the house.

1272
00:54:05,481 --> 00:54:07,610
- Yes. That's great. - Please help me a lot.

1273
00:54:09,211 --> 00:54:10,610
- See you then. - See you.

1274
00:54:10,610 --> 00:54:11,920
(Ji Won and Cheol Hyeon's secret conversation has ended.)

1275
00:54:12,951 --> 00:54:15,990
I didn't know that much time had passed.

1276
00:54:15,990 --> 00:54:18,920
I think we had a nice conversation.

1277
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:23,690
Cheol Hyeon seemed to be very sensitive as well.

1278
00:54:23,690 --> 00:54:27,061
I thought we could talk about many things...

1279
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:30,670
as we're like-minded.

1280
00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:33,400
(He returns after 20 minutes of secret conversation.)

1281
00:54:37,641 --> 00:54:39,141
- It was fun. - You ordered more food.

1282
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:42,211
- We ordered just now. - It took really long.

1283
00:54:42,211 --> 00:54:43,650
Where have you been?

1284
00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:45,351
We ordered as many as two more dishes...

1285
00:54:45,351 --> 00:54:46,420
- as you were not coming. - Right.

1286
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:49,451
They reheated it a little. It's delicious.

1287
00:54:49,451 --> 00:54:50,490
(He's quiet unlike usual.)

1288
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:54,061
- The squid was so good. - Yes.

1289
00:54:54,061 --> 00:54:55,090
It was so good...

1290
00:54:55,090 --> 00:54:56,530
- that I'm still thinking about it. - It was so good.

1291
00:54:56,530 --> 00:54:58,030
The squid with whole heads of garlic was amazing.

1292
00:54:58,501 --> 00:54:59,701
I do want to eat it again.

1293
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:02,331
- Squid with garlic, please. - Let's order just one more.

1294
00:55:02,331 --> 00:55:04,300
- One squid with garlic, sir? - Yes. Thank you.

1295
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:08,740
I heard some places bone it for you.

1296
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:10,010
(Shush! This is a private message only for you.)

1297
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:11,070
(A female participant requests to talk to you in private.)

1298
00:55:11,070 --> 00:55:12,181
(Tell the guys you're going to the bathroom...)

1299
00:55:12,181 --> 00:55:13,211
(and secretly go to the 19th floor of the adjacent building.)

1300
00:55:13,211 --> 00:55:15,481
Only then the puzzle pieces came together.

1301
00:55:15,481 --> 00:55:17,311
Each of them went somewhere.

1302
00:55:18,251 --> 00:55:20,420
I don't think any of them can become an actor.

1303
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:22,920
They were coming in while acting so awkwardly.

1304
00:55:23,121 --> 00:55:24,220
(I have a stomachache.)

1305
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:25,220
(You have a stomachache?)

1306
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:26,621
"What's the matter with him?"

1307
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:28,690
(He made a strange excuse somehow.)

1308
00:55:29,530 --> 00:55:31,831
"Does he have something to do?"

1309
00:55:32,161 --> 00:55:33,731
(He was quiet, which felt strange somehow.)

1310
00:55:33,731 --> 00:55:35,300
We ordered as many as two more dishes.

1311
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:36,601
"Are they hiding something from me?"

1312
00:55:36,601 --> 00:55:39,240
I did have thoughts like that, to be honest.

1313
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:41,070
(Who was the most obvious?)

1314
00:55:41,470 --> 00:55:42,510
Cheol Hyeon.

1315
00:55:45,110 --> 00:55:47,211
When I'm with him...

1316
00:55:47,211 --> 00:55:49,451
Our eyes meet the most often...

1317
00:55:49,681 --> 00:55:51,621
when we open the pink envelope.

1318
00:55:52,021 --> 00:55:54,021
I think we look at each other almost at the same time.

1319
00:55:54,021 --> 00:55:56,090
I can see his facial expression at that moment.

1320
00:55:56,090 --> 00:55:57,650
And it happened several times.

1321
00:55:57,650 --> 00:55:59,621
So I know the face he makes...

1322
00:55:59,621 --> 00:56:01,990
when he has concerns or questions.

1323
00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:03,331
He can't hide it.

1324
00:56:03,331 --> 00:56:06,561
I saw that facial expression.

1325
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:07,900
So I knew something was going on.

1326
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:14,970
Excuse me for a moment.

1327
00:56:14,970 --> 00:56:16,010
- Sure. - Yes.

1328
00:56:17,070 --> 00:56:18,911
Should I get you Melona? Or is it Haagen-Dazs?

1329
00:56:18,911 --> 00:56:20,211
Haagen-Dazs, please.

1330
00:56:20,211 --> 00:56:21,211
(He's leaving in a relaxed manner while making a joke.)

1331
00:56:22,181 --> 00:56:23,251
Gosh.

1332
00:56:23,650 --> 00:56:24,681
- Will he talk with her... - He's the last one.

1333
00:56:24,681 --> 00:56:26,081
more than ten minutes?

1334
00:56:26,081 --> 00:56:27,550
- Somehow... - I think he will.

1335
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:29,420
She knows he's the last one anyway.

1336
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:30,951
- And she has enough time. - Right.

1337
00:56:42,371 --> 00:56:43,800
I had no idea.

1338
00:56:44,070 --> 00:56:45,701
"It must be one of the girls in the house."

1339
00:56:45,701 --> 00:56:47,340
"But who would it be?" That's exactly what I thought.

1340
00:56:59,981 --> 00:57:01,891
I think the other guys had thought the same way.

1341
00:57:01,891 --> 00:57:03,550
I thought it might be Yun Ha.

1342
00:57:03,550 --> 00:57:05,561
She had long black hair.

1343
00:57:05,561 --> 00:57:08,530
She had bangs, she had a high nose too.

1344
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:10,831
"Is it Yun Ha?" That's what I thought at first.

1345
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:16,630
- Hello. - Hello.

1346
00:57:16,630 --> 00:57:18,570
"What? Did I come to the wrong place?"

1347
00:57:18,570 --> 00:57:20,940
I'm Ji Won.

1348
00:57:21,170 --> 00:57:22,811
- Ji Won? - Ji Won.

1349
00:57:23,110 --> 00:57:24,940
- It's nice to meet you. - What's your name?

1350
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:26,211
I'm Yong Woo.

1351
00:57:26,211 --> 00:57:27,411
- Yong Woo? - Yes.

1352
00:57:27,411 --> 00:57:28,780
- It's nice to meet you. - It's nice to meet you.

1353
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:31,820
Who are you?

1354
00:57:33,751 --> 00:57:37,190
- I'll be living with you... - Okay.

1355
00:57:37,490 --> 00:57:38,590
starting from today.

1356
00:57:38,590 --> 00:57:39,621
- Is that so? - Yes.

1357
00:57:39,621 --> 00:57:40,961
I'm glad to meet you.

1358
00:57:40,961 --> 00:57:42,961
- Please help me a lot. - I'll need your help too.

1359
00:57:43,161 --> 00:57:45,601
If I were to talk about her image, she was like Cleopatra.

1360
00:57:45,601 --> 00:57:48,470
With black straight hair and bangs.

1361
00:57:48,670 --> 00:57:51,601
She looked exotic.

1362
00:57:51,601 --> 00:57:55,070
And the place was amazing.

1363
00:57:55,170 --> 00:57:57,240
It was located on a high floor. It was on the 19th floor...

1364
00:57:57,240 --> 00:58:00,541
with an open view of Han River.

1365
00:58:00,811 --> 00:58:02,911
I think it was a city view.

1366
00:58:03,010 --> 00:58:04,351
She was sitting there alone,

1367
00:58:04,351 --> 00:58:06,720
crossing her legs with a glass of wine.

1368
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:10,720
She looked charismatic at that moment.

1369
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:11,891
This place is beautiful.

1370
00:58:12,291 --> 00:58:13,320
- Right? - Yes.

1371
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:14,791
I was enjoying it.

1372
00:58:14,791 --> 00:58:18,030
- I see. Shall we? Yes. - Shall we have a drink?

1373
00:58:18,030 --> 00:58:19,860
- It's nice to meet you. - It's nice to meet you.

1374
00:58:22,771 --> 00:58:24,940
What is it like living in the house?

1375
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:26,170
It's very fun.

1376
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:28,641
I'm having a lot of fun.

1377
00:58:28,641 --> 00:58:30,711
Can I call it home?

1378
00:58:30,711 --> 00:58:33,010
- It feels like home now. - Already?

1379
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:35,711
- I sleep more deeply... - You do?

1380
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:36,911
than I did in my home.

1381
00:58:36,911 --> 00:58:39,251
I've been nervous since this morning.

1382
00:58:39,521 --> 00:58:41,521
The anxiety tired me out now.

1383
00:58:41,521 --> 00:58:44,391
- You were nervous. - I'm not nervous because I'm tired.

1384
00:58:44,391 --> 00:58:45,661
Make yourself comfortable now.

1385
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:48,021
- Ji Won. - Yes.

1386
00:58:48,190 --> 00:58:49,260
I'm pleased to meet you.

1387
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:53,961
Can I ask you a question now?

1388
00:58:53,961 --> 00:58:55,271
You met me, who has been living there.

1389
00:58:55,271 --> 00:58:56,771
How do you feel now that you've seen me?

1390
00:58:56,771 --> 00:58:58,400
- I'm relieved. - You are?

1391
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:01,740
- It seems you've been doing well. - Yes.

1392
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:04,541
I think you feel very comfortable in the house,

1393
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:07,981
which makes me think living there would be better than I thought.

1394
00:59:07,981 --> 00:59:09,681
I'm so excited.

1395
00:59:09,681 --> 00:59:12,751
- And now that I'm looking at you, - Yes.

1396
00:59:13,681 --> 00:59:15,150
How is it?

1397
00:59:15,150 --> 00:59:17,891
- I feel very comfortable now. - you look very relaxed.

1398
00:59:17,891 --> 00:59:20,121
I came out nonchalantly.

1399
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:21,760
So I was a little surprised.

1400
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:24,900
Who were you expecting to see?

1401
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:26,030
I couldn't imagine.

1402
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:28,101
It got more complicated in my head.

1403
00:59:28,101 --> 00:59:30,501
Because it might mean one of their siblings...

1404
00:59:30,501 --> 00:59:33,240
hasn't come yet.

1405
00:59:33,501 --> 00:59:35,570
I started to have complicated thoughts,

1406
00:59:35,570 --> 00:59:37,070
so I stopped thinking about it.

1407
00:59:37,070 --> 00:59:39,581
- Do you like travelling? - I love it.

1408
00:59:39,581 --> 00:59:41,440
Can I ask...

1409
00:59:41,541 --> 00:59:42,610
- which place was your favourite? - Well...

1410
00:59:42,610 --> 00:59:45,021
I went to Europe by myself...

1411
00:59:45,021 --> 00:59:47,021
when I was a junior in college.

1412
00:59:47,021 --> 00:59:48,050
Was it just a while ago?

1413
00:59:48,391 --> 00:59:49,720
What? Well...

1414
00:59:50,650 --> 00:59:51,690
It's a joke.

1415
00:59:51,990 --> 00:59:53,760
I almost answered it.

1416
00:59:55,130 --> 00:59:57,231
What do you do?

1417
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:59,231
I'm a pilot.

1418
00:59:59,231 --> 01:00:00,630
- You are? - Yes.

1419
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:02,501
- It suits you. - Do you think so?

1420
01:00:02,501 --> 01:00:05,641
I'm working hard to become an aviation instructor...

1421
01:00:05,641 --> 01:00:07,900
in Korean airlines...

1422
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:10,170
and aviation academies in America.

1423
01:00:10,170 --> 01:00:12,110
- I see. - That's what I do.

1424
01:00:12,110 --> 01:00:13,681
I'm working...

1425
01:00:13,681 --> 01:00:15,050
- for an entertainment company. - An entertainment company?

1426
01:00:15,050 --> 01:00:17,911
I'm working in the artist production team.

1427
01:00:17,911 --> 01:00:20,880
So you're producing singers...

1428
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:22,951
- and artists in the team. - You're right.

1429
01:00:22,951 --> 01:00:23,951
Excuse me.

1430
01:00:24,990 --> 01:00:26,190
(10 minutes have passed.)

1431
01:00:26,190 --> 01:00:27,461
(Will you continue your conversation with Yong Woo?)

1432
01:00:27,461 --> 01:00:28,630
(You now have 10 minutes left.)

1433
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:32,400
(I will continue.)

1434
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:33,461
Yes.

1435
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:36,601
He seemed strong-minded...

1436
01:00:36,831 --> 01:00:38,440
with a lot of experience.

1437
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:42,470
It seemed he was the most mature one among the four.

1438
01:00:42,570 --> 01:00:46,811
I thought he was someone...

1439
01:00:46,811 --> 01:00:48,411
I could rely on.

1440
01:00:50,751 --> 01:00:52,481
- She felt it at that moment. - I think everyone said so.

1441
01:00:52,481 --> 01:00:53,880
Because he looks reliable.

1442
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:55,220
Right.

1443
01:00:55,220 --> 01:00:56,351
It was the first time we met,

1444
01:00:56,351 --> 01:00:58,920
but I wondered if I was too comfortable around her.

1445
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:00,621
I felt very comfortable...

1446
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:02,791
when we were talking.

1447
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:10,431
(Meanwhile, Cheol Hyeon really went to the restroom.)

1448
01:01:11,070 --> 01:01:13,041
I was so surprised.

1449
01:01:14,041 --> 01:01:16,771
I was so surprised.

1450
01:01:16,871 --> 01:01:18,010
You're so cute.

1451
01:01:18,641 --> 01:01:21,510
I was shocked.

1452
01:01:21,510 --> 01:01:24,711
I felt a sudden surge of energy inside.

1453
01:01:24,711 --> 01:01:26,420
- Right? - I felt a dopamine rush.

1454
01:01:26,420 --> 01:01:27,451
Right.

1455
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:29,050
- It got me so surprised. - It's so interesting.

1456
01:01:29,050 --> 01:01:30,291
The night view was amazing.

1457
01:01:32,121 --> 01:01:34,461
I even took a photo.

1458
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:36,990
This is fun. It suddenly became so interesting.

1459
01:01:37,090 --> 01:01:40,260
You felt a sudden dopamine rush, didn't you?

1460
01:01:40,260 --> 01:01:41,300
Yes.

1461
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:42,900
I asked her...

1462
01:01:43,001 --> 01:01:45,670
if she had talked about MBTI with others. She said no.

1463
01:01:45,771 --> 01:01:47,400
So I asked what type she was.

1464
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:48,641
She's ENFJ.

1465
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:50,570
Isn't it so interesting?

1466
01:01:50,570 --> 01:01:51,610
- Everyone is a judging type. - Someone else is the same type.

1467
01:01:51,711 --> 01:01:53,311
- ENFJ? That's Se Seung. - Yes.

1468
01:01:53,411 --> 01:01:54,780
I knew it.

1469
01:01:55,150 --> 01:01:57,150
If she's the judging type as well, Yun Ha is...

1470
01:01:57,811 --> 01:01:59,481
the only one who is a perceiving type.

1471
01:01:59,481 --> 01:02:01,181
Cho A is the only introvert while the others are all extroverts.

1472
01:02:01,181 --> 01:02:02,590
It's like living on an island by yourself.

1473
01:02:02,690 --> 01:02:05,360
But this new person must've come with someone.

1474
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:06,360
I know.

1475
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:07,720
It suddenly came to my mind.

1476
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:09,231
Who would it be?

1477
01:02:11,731 --> 01:02:12,900
She said...

1478
01:02:13,001 --> 01:02:16,900
I was the least perplexed one.

1479
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:18,400
- So you were calm? - When I first entered the place...

1480
01:02:18,501 --> 01:02:19,670
I wasn't calm.

1481
01:02:19,670 --> 01:02:21,911
I didn't think she would be living with us.

1482
01:02:21,970 --> 01:02:23,070
I was just like, "What's going on?"

1483
01:02:23,170 --> 01:02:25,711
Right. "What's going on?" It was more like that for me too.

1484
01:02:25,711 --> 01:02:27,981
She had long black hair...

1485
01:02:27,981 --> 01:02:29,510
with bangs.

1486
01:02:29,610 --> 01:02:30,981
I thought it was Yun Ha.

1487
01:02:31,681 --> 01:02:33,681
- Oh, right. - Me too.

1488
01:02:33,681 --> 01:02:35,590
- "Is it Yun Ha?" - Me too.

1489
01:02:35,590 --> 01:02:37,420
I was like that when I entered the bar, but I was wrong.

1490
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:39,121
- When I entered, I thought... - Everyone had the same thought.

1491
01:02:39,121 --> 01:02:40,621
- it was Yun Ha. - I thought it was Yun Ha.

1492
01:02:40,621 --> 01:02:41,661
Yes. Me too.

1493
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:43,260
When I saw this part of her face,

1494
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:44,530
- I realized she wasn't Yun Ha. - Right.

1495
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:46,561
- Right. - It was the same for me.

1496
01:02:47,101 --> 01:02:49,231
- I was like that too. - "Who are you?"

1497
01:02:49,331 --> 01:02:51,030
- Right. - "Who are you?"

1498
01:02:51,371 --> 01:02:53,771
Everyone had the same thought. That gives me goosebumps.

1499
01:02:53,871 --> 01:02:54,871
Is there a room for her?

1500
01:02:55,570 --> 01:02:56,570
No, there isn't.

1501
01:02:56,641 --> 01:02:59,440
- Does it mean... - No one knows.

1502
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:00,481
Is there a third floor?

1503
01:03:02,481 --> 01:03:04,711
- There might be basement level two. - Now, something...

1504
01:03:04,711 --> 01:03:07,981
I didn't even imagine is happening.

1505
01:03:08,081 --> 01:03:09,791
I see.

1506
01:03:10,650 --> 01:03:12,590
If it's your fifth day,

1507
01:03:12,590 --> 01:03:15,661
have you developed feelings for someone?

1508
01:03:16,961 --> 01:03:19,300
It's hard to say I have feelings for someone.

1509
01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:21,501
But there is someone I'd like to talk with more.

1510
01:03:21,601 --> 01:03:23,070
- There's someone... - Yes.

1511
01:03:23,070 --> 01:03:25,201
- you'd like to talk with more. - Yes, there is.

1512
01:03:25,771 --> 01:03:27,771
Is there someone you wanted to talk with more?

1513
01:03:27,871 --> 01:03:29,470
Yes, there is.

1514
01:03:29,470 --> 01:03:32,311
There is someone I'd like to talk with more.

1515
01:03:32,510 --> 01:03:34,041
What do you like to do...

1516
01:03:34,041 --> 01:03:35,911
when you have free time?

1517
01:03:36,181 --> 01:03:38,751
I just like meeting my friends. Talking...

1518
01:03:38,851 --> 01:03:40,150
and eating delicious food.

1519
01:03:40,251 --> 01:03:41,320
You can't resist good food.

1520
01:03:42,990 --> 01:03:44,090
Does it suit your taste?

1521
01:03:44,590 --> 01:03:45,590
- This? - Yes.

1522
01:03:45,590 --> 01:03:47,061
- It seems you didn't eat anything. - You didn't eat anything, right?

1523
01:03:47,061 --> 01:03:49,331
No, I didn't. Have you?

1524
01:03:49,331 --> 01:03:51,291
- I've tried this and this. - I see.

1525
01:03:51,291 --> 01:03:52,331
Which one is better?

1526
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:55,400
This one.

1527
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:56,771
- This one is the best? - Yes.

1528
01:03:56,771 --> 01:03:58,201
- I'll go with this one then. - Try this.

1529
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:00,570
Let me have a bite too.

1530
01:04:02,070 --> 01:04:04,570
I think it's the snack I know.

1531
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:07,780
(Savouring)

1532
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:09,851
Do you like sports?

1533
01:04:11,610 --> 01:04:12,951
- Truffle. - Sorry?

1534
01:04:12,951 --> 01:04:14,451
- Truffle. - Truffle?

1535
01:04:14,451 --> 01:04:15,690
- Yes. - I asked about sports.

1536
01:04:15,690 --> 01:04:17,720
- Sports? - What did you hear?

1537
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:19,260
I must be crazy about food.

1538
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:20,791
I thought you said sauce.

1539
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:22,331
Sauce?

1540
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:25,201
- Sauce? Oh, my gosh. - Sauce?

1541
01:04:25,201 --> 01:04:27,400
Isn't his attitude a little different...

1542
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:29,070
from when he's with other women?

1543
01:04:29,070 --> 01:04:30,670
He became suave somehow.

1544
01:04:30,670 --> 01:04:31,670
- I know. - Yes.

1545
01:04:31,670 --> 01:04:34,371
It seems he likes to look more masculine...

1546
01:04:34,371 --> 01:04:35,711
- rather than being kind... - Right.

1547
01:04:35,711 --> 01:04:37,041
to her.

1548
01:04:37,541 --> 01:04:39,041
I can't believe he changed so much.

1549
01:04:39,411 --> 01:04:41,181
So your favourite sauce is the one with truffle.

1550
01:04:41,181 --> 01:04:43,211
I know you didn't ask.

1551
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:46,581
I run a lot these days.

1552
01:04:46,681 --> 01:04:47,720
How about you?

1553
01:04:48,121 --> 01:04:52,021
Sports? I like racket sports.

1554
01:04:52,021 --> 01:04:53,490
- Like tennis. - Tennis?

1555
01:04:53,590 --> 01:04:55,561
I do want to try tennis...

1556
01:04:56,090 --> 01:04:57,990
- and see how it is. - It's fun. You'll be good at it.

1557
01:04:57,990 --> 01:04:59,260
How long have you been doing it?

1558
01:04:59,260 --> 01:05:01,931
I haven't done it long enough to say.

1559
01:05:02,530 --> 01:05:05,400
I'm just doing it for fun.

1560
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:06,440
That's what you say, but...

1561
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:09,010
- You might smash the ball. - I might spike it.

1562
01:05:09,010 --> 01:05:10,771
You might smash the ball onto someone's face.

1563
01:05:10,871 --> 01:05:11,871
No.

1564
01:05:11,871 --> 01:05:14,581
Unlike her appearance that reminded me of Cleopatra,

1565
01:05:14,681 --> 01:05:17,050
she talked gently and humorously.

1566
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:19,021
Although she was wearing a shy smile,

1567
01:05:19,351 --> 01:05:22,550
she wasn't really hesitant to speak her mind.

1568
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:26,720
I enjoyed the conversation.

1569
01:05:27,121 --> 01:05:28,391
People who don't...

1570
01:05:32,831 --> 01:05:35,061
(The secret conversation with all male participants has ended.)

1571
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:38,701
(You can choose one of them to go out with tonight.)

1572
01:05:38,701 --> 01:05:42,610
(You will also have a Benefit Date with the participant tomorrow.)

1573
01:05:42,610 --> 01:05:44,670
(Send the name of the participant you want.)

1574
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:46,280
- What? - With one of them?

1575
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:47,840
- Right away? - What?

1576
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:49,110
- Tonight? - Oh, my gosh.

1577
01:05:49,211 --> 01:05:51,951
As she came late, she received great benefits.

1578
01:05:51,951 --> 01:05:52,951
- I know. - Yes.

1579
01:05:52,951 --> 01:05:54,880
But I think it's reasonable.

1580
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:56,291
- Honestly. - Five days have passed.

1581
01:05:56,550 --> 01:05:58,351
- Yes. - They should make up for it.

1582
01:05:58,351 --> 01:05:59,391
Absolutely.

1583
01:05:59,391 --> 01:06:00,621
- It must be confusing. - Who would she choose?

1584
01:06:01,021 --> 01:06:02,030
Yong Woo.

1585
01:06:02,690 --> 01:06:03,760
Don't you think she'll choose Cheol Hyeon?

1586
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:04,831
- I think she'll choose Cheol Hyeon. - It'll be Cheol Hyeon.

1587
01:06:04,831 --> 01:06:05,860
You think so?

1588
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:07,831
It'll become legendary if she chooses Jae Hyung here.

1589
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:09,030
(He's a legendary fan of Jae Hyung.)

1590
01:06:09,030 --> 01:06:11,170
- She'll never choose him. - Thinking about the old memories.

1591
01:06:11,371 --> 01:06:12,601
Ji Won, can you please choose him?

1592
01:06:12,940 --> 01:06:15,271
(The secret conversation with all male participants has ended.)

1593
01:06:15,470 --> 01:06:19,010
(You can choose one of them to go out with tonight.)

1594
01:06:19,010 --> 01:06:22,851
(You will also have a Benefit Date with the participant tomorrow.)

1595
01:06:22,851 --> 01:06:24,911
(Send the name of the participant you want.)

1596
01:06:29,951 --> 01:06:32,090
(Yong Woo received a message as well.)

1597
01:06:32,590 --> 01:06:36,090
(The secret conversation is over. Please leave the bar.)

1598
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:39,831
I guess you received a text. I received one as well.

1599
01:06:39,931 --> 01:06:41,501
I think they're closing the bar now.

1600
01:06:41,501 --> 01:06:42,771
Yes. I'll see you again in the house.

1601
01:06:42,771 --> 01:06:44,400
I'll get going first.

1602
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:45,400
See you in the house.

1603
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:47,141
- See you. - Yes.

1604
01:06:50,641 --> 01:06:52,711
(Ji Won and Yong Woo's secret conversation has ended.)

1605
01:07:04,550 --> 01:07:05,561
Was there a long line...

1606
01:07:05,561 --> 01:07:06,990
- for the restroom? - You're back.

1607
01:07:06,990 --> 01:07:08,391
I left just now.

1608
01:07:09,231 --> 01:07:11,130
Did something happen?

1609
01:07:11,731 --> 01:07:12,731
- Oh, my. - He's better than us.

1610
01:07:15,001 --> 01:07:18,201
(Ji Won is contemplating alone.)

1611
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:27,280
I contemplated a lot.

1612
01:07:27,581 --> 01:07:30,911
I was torn between Jung Sub and Yong Woo.

1613
01:07:31,351 --> 01:07:33,220
- What? - It wasn't Cheol Hyeon?

1614
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:35,181
- Wait. - I think I'm so oblivious.

1615
01:07:35,181 --> 01:07:36,190
Wait. Jung Sub?

1616
01:07:36,190 --> 01:07:38,320
He was the first one she met, and he wasn't bad.

1617
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:40,220
I guess she moved on for no particular reason then.

1618
01:07:40,220 --> 01:07:42,661
After meeting everyone, she compared them.

1619
01:07:42,661 --> 01:07:44,630
And she thought about the first person she met.

1620
01:07:44,630 --> 01:07:45,630
Really?

1621
01:07:45,630 --> 01:07:47,860
- It would be Jung Sub, right? - Yes. She talked with Yong Woo...

1622
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:48,931
- for twice as long. - Right.

1623
01:07:48,931 --> 01:07:51,371
I liked...

1624
01:07:51,371 --> 01:07:54,440
their calm energy.

1625
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:57,610
I'm more drown...

1626
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:00,041
to a calm and strong-minded person...

1627
01:08:00,041 --> 01:08:01,711
these days.

1628
01:08:01,811 --> 01:08:05,621
Rather than those who were bright and bubbly...

1629
01:08:06,020 --> 01:08:07,451
based on the first impression,

1630
01:08:07,451 --> 01:08:09,221
I preferred...

1631
01:08:10,421 --> 01:08:12,921
the calm ones.

1632
01:08:13,190 --> 01:08:16,060
If Jung Sub hadn't been the first person I met,

1633
01:08:16,060 --> 01:08:19,461
I would've wanted to continue the conversation.

1634
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:37,650
(She's writing a name after much consideration.)

1635
01:08:40,051 --> 01:08:43,190
(Ji Won made her choice.)

1636
01:08:45,490 --> 01:08:46,621
I don't know.

1637
01:08:49,930 --> 01:08:52,430
- The time... - It'd be the standard time, right?

1638
01:08:52,430 --> 01:08:54,060
- I got a text. - What?

1639
01:08:56,801 --> 01:08:57,871
I received a text.

1640
01:09:03,511 --> 01:09:05,881
- Oh, gosh. - Oh, gosh.

1641
01:09:06,211 --> 01:09:07,211
Oh, my.

1642
01:09:07,211 --> 01:09:08,511
(Ji Won, the new female participant...)

1643
01:09:08,511 --> 01:09:09,780
(you had a secret conversation with today, chose Yong Woo as her date.)

1644
01:09:09,780 --> 01:09:11,081
(Yong Woo, please move now.)

1645
01:09:11,081 --> 01:09:12,110
We received the same text, didn't we?

1646
01:09:12,221 --> 01:09:13,421
I think we did.

1647
01:09:16,421 --> 01:09:18,150
- Yong Woo? - Yong Woo?

1648
01:09:18,150 --> 01:09:19,360
Really?

1649
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:20,921
- I didn't expect this at all. - All my predictions are wrong.

1650
01:09:21,020 --> 01:09:24,291
- He's busy. - Yong Woo is so popular.

1651
01:09:25,331 --> 01:09:26,761
I was honestly bewildered.

1652
01:09:26,860 --> 01:09:29,201
It seemed like I was the only one who was going somewhere else.

1653
01:09:29,301 --> 01:09:30,831
It felt good,

1654
01:09:30,831 --> 01:09:33,471
but at the same time, I think I was a bit puzzled.

1655
01:09:35,001 --> 01:09:36,011
I wonder why.

1656
01:09:36,140 --> 01:09:37,240
I'm going to...

1657
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:39,841
- You should get going. - I should... Yes.

1658
01:09:41,341 --> 01:09:42,350
I'll get going now.

1659
01:09:42,350 --> 01:09:44,280
- Yes, see you. - All right.

1660
01:09:45,411 --> 01:09:48,251
And he was never seen again.

1661
01:09:48,251 --> 01:09:50,421
Well, I'm going to go now.

1662
01:09:50,421 --> 01:09:51,421
- Yes, see you. - Bye.

1663
01:09:52,690 --> 01:09:54,291
(Yong Woo gets up first.)

1664
01:09:54,490 --> 01:09:55,490
I felt...

1665
01:09:55,490 --> 01:09:57,030
- the confidence of a winner. - His confidence.

1666
01:09:58,060 --> 01:09:59,230
He's amazing.

1667
01:10:01,631 --> 01:10:04,301
The four of us were reading that text and we went,

1668
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:05,400
"I see."

1669
01:10:06,541 --> 01:10:08,770
"I see, so this is what it's like."

1670
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:11,671
That was it, and Yong Woo...

1671
01:10:12,011 --> 01:10:13,780
Yong Woo must be feeling good.

1672
01:10:13,780 --> 01:10:15,551
"It's me again."

1673
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:20,421
What kind of conversation led the new participant...

1674
01:10:20,421 --> 01:10:22,921
to choose him after such a short time?

1675
01:10:23,251 --> 01:10:25,890
To be honest, I kind of...

1676
01:10:26,921 --> 01:10:28,020
wanted to see what he's like.

1677
01:10:28,490 --> 01:10:30,530
I wanted to watch and learn what I could.

1678
01:10:30,860 --> 01:10:33,360
(Maybe she chose him because he fits her ideal type?)

1679
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:36,230
That could be it, but...

1680
01:10:37,930 --> 01:10:39,940
You're right.

1681
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:41,740
That could be it.

1682
01:10:42,341 --> 01:10:44,341
Right, I didn't think of that.

1683
01:10:45,011 --> 01:10:47,180
Anyway, I guess I felt a bit disappointed.

1684
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:51,251
I thought we connected.

1685
01:10:51,551 --> 01:10:53,051
I think I was in denial.

1686
01:10:56,721 --> 01:10:57,721
Gosh, this is interesting.

1687
01:10:57,721 --> 01:11:00,221
How could they send the text like that?

1688
01:11:00,221 --> 01:11:02,661
I guess letting us know like this is better.

1689
01:11:05,030 --> 01:11:07,161
Amazing.

1690
01:11:07,730 --> 01:11:08,730
Interesting.

1691
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:12,030
(With the exception of Yong Woo, the men head home.)

1692
01:11:13,541 --> 01:11:15,570
I think Cheol Hyeon tends to say...

1693
01:11:15,570 --> 01:11:16,770
"interesting" when he's in a bad mood.

1694
01:11:17,341 --> 01:11:19,341
It's like a rock...

1695
01:11:19,341 --> 01:11:20,541
- fell into a calm lake. - Yes.

1696
01:11:20,541 --> 01:11:21,881
- Right. - He thinks it's interesting.

1697
01:11:24,850 --> 01:11:26,251
Gosh, this is so interesting.

1698
01:11:26,581 --> 01:11:28,850
- What's going on? - This is really interesting.

1699
01:11:29,451 --> 01:11:31,051
(Cheol Hyeon and Jung Sub are laughing.)

1700
01:11:31,051 --> 01:11:32,490
(Jae Hyung is laughing.)

1701
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:38,631
I feel disoriented.

1702
01:11:39,331 --> 01:11:42,570
It's late at night. Yong Woo should...

1703
01:11:42,671 --> 01:11:44,530
hurry home and go to sleep.

1704
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:47,301
He's my roommate.

1705
01:11:47,940 --> 01:11:50,411
If he comes back in the middle of the night,

1706
01:11:50,411 --> 01:11:51,671
- he'll wake me up. - I have work tomorrow.

1707
01:11:51,671 --> 01:11:53,711
I have to go to work tomorrow.

1708
01:11:53,711 --> 01:11:55,650
He'll be rustling about late at night.

1709
01:11:58,780 --> 01:12:00,350
I feel...

1710
01:12:02,020 --> 01:12:03,091
so good.

1711
01:12:03,921 --> 01:12:06,520
- The food was good. - Right. The food was good.

1712
01:12:08,060 --> 01:12:09,631
We can come back for the squid.

1713
01:12:09,791 --> 01:12:11,791
- I'm never coming back. - I won't.

1714
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:14,400
Really?

1715
01:12:14,761 --> 01:12:16,331
I really enjoyed the squid.

1716
01:12:17,070 --> 01:12:18,631
I guess Yong Woo would come back.

1717
01:12:19,001 --> 01:12:20,001
I see.

1718
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:23,940
Was I too caught up in the squid?

1719
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:28,041
When three or more men are gathered together,

1720
01:12:28,041 --> 01:12:29,810
their collective intelligence tends to drop.

1721
01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:31,980
It drops accurately, little by little.

1722
01:12:32,081 --> 01:12:33,721
Is that why the three of us are like this right now?

1723
01:12:34,921 --> 01:12:35,921
It drops.

1724
01:12:40,390 --> 01:12:41,390
So what should we say?

1725
01:12:41,860 --> 01:12:43,690
- What? - Where's Yong Woo?

1726
01:12:43,961 --> 01:12:45,860
He had some personal business to take care of...

1727
01:12:45,860 --> 01:12:46,860
His own personal business?

1728
01:12:46,860 --> 01:12:48,661
- Yes. Personal business. - Well, it is personal.

1729
01:12:48,661 --> 01:12:50,100
His actual personal matter.

1730
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:51,570
- It really is personal. - Right.

1731
01:12:52,570 --> 01:12:54,400
- Gosh, this is nice. - Gosh.

1732
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:55,810
(Jung Sub is thinking.)

1733
01:12:55,810 --> 01:12:56,810
(Cheol Hyeon is sighing)

1734
01:12:57,110 --> 01:12:58,110
We're here.

1735
01:12:58,110 --> 01:12:59,341
(They feel bitter tonight.)

1736
01:13:00,211 --> 01:13:02,751
(They arrived home unenthusiastically.)

1737
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:05,921
(The door won't open.)

1738
01:13:06,980 --> 01:13:08,150
We're at the right place, right?

1739
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:09,921
(The gate is locked.)

1740
01:13:10,890 --> 01:13:12,251
Please open the gate for us.

1741
01:13:12,251 --> 01:13:13,461
- What? - Hello.

1742
01:13:13,461 --> 01:13:15,520
- Are you finally back? - Let us in, please.

1743
01:13:15,661 --> 01:13:17,091
I mean, excuse me, guys.

1744
01:13:17,091 --> 01:13:19,661
It's past curfew, so we locked the gate.

1745
01:13:19,661 --> 01:13:21,761
- We're sorry. - You were taking too long.

1746
01:13:21,761 --> 01:13:22,900
- I see. - We were hanging out by ourselves.

1747
01:13:23,171 --> 01:13:24,570
They're finally home.

1748
01:13:24,770 --> 01:13:27,301
They were so late, and they even broke curfew.

1749
01:13:27,301 --> 01:13:28,341
It was past midnight.

1750
01:13:28,971 --> 01:13:30,541
(You have a curfew?)

1751
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:31,640
No.

1752
01:13:32,740 --> 01:13:36,051
That's how I let them know I was disappointed.

1753
01:13:38,081 --> 01:13:39,921
- Hi. - Hi.

1754
01:13:39,921 --> 01:13:42,721
- Hello. - Hello.

1755
01:13:42,721 --> 01:13:43,951
Hello.

1756
01:13:44,190 --> 01:13:46,121
Where have you been, Cheol Hyeon?

1757
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:47,560
(They're in trouble as soon as they're inside.)

1758
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:49,190
We just had dinner.

1759
01:13:50,461 --> 01:13:52,360
- What did you do, Jung Sub? - We ate and had drinks.

1760
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:53,801
- We had dinner, - Yes.

1761
01:13:54,100 --> 01:13:56,501
- and we had drinks and snacks. - I see.

1762
01:13:56,900 --> 01:13:58,131
- It was great. - We had such a good time.

1763
01:13:58,131 --> 01:13:59,270
- I see. - Yes.

1764
01:14:01,070 --> 01:14:02,070
Sounds nice.

1765
01:14:02,070 --> 01:14:03,841
(They managed to pass one obstacle.)

1766
01:14:04,911 --> 01:14:06,411
Did you have a good time?

1767
01:14:07,041 --> 01:14:08,610
The food was very delicious.

1768
01:14:08,841 --> 01:14:09,911
What did you eat?

1769
01:14:10,211 --> 01:14:12,251
- We went to some kind of tent bar, - What...

1770
01:14:12,350 --> 01:14:15,121
- I see. You're back. - We just ate...

1771
01:14:15,121 --> 01:14:16,451
- a variety of food. - Hi, Ju Yeon.

1772
01:14:16,451 --> 01:14:18,421
- Hello. - But the best one...

1773
01:14:18,421 --> 01:14:20,320
- was the squid. The whole squid. - Hello.

1774
01:14:20,621 --> 01:14:21,621
Squid and garlic?

1775
01:14:22,221 --> 01:14:23,661
Was it delicious as you ate without us?

1776
01:14:24,230 --> 01:14:25,661
- Yes. - I see.

1777
01:14:27,331 --> 01:14:28,331
No, it wasn't delicious.

1778
01:14:28,331 --> 01:14:29,331
(He seems a little drunk.)

1779
01:14:31,331 --> 01:14:32,371
Where's Yong Woo?

1780
01:14:33,671 --> 01:14:36,211
We were drinking together, but Yong Woo...

1781
01:14:36,211 --> 01:14:37,471
had to go somewhere...

1782
01:14:37,971 --> 01:14:40,110
because of personal business.

1783
01:14:40,881 --> 01:14:43,951
Something personal came up so he had to go.

1784
01:14:44,451 --> 01:14:45,881
(I see.)

1785
01:14:46,350 --> 01:14:49,081
I thought he got into trouble.

1786
01:14:49,890 --> 01:14:53,520
I thought maybe he pretended to be busy and went somewhere.

1787
01:14:55,291 --> 01:14:57,860
(Yong Woo is busy.)

1788
01:15:15,381 --> 01:15:17,711
Hello. Nice to meet you.

1789
01:15:18,411 --> 01:15:19,621
It's nice to meet you too.

1790
01:15:19,951 --> 01:15:21,581
The door is closed now.

1791
01:15:22,451 --> 01:15:24,591
You seemed too cold.

1792
01:15:24,591 --> 01:15:25,690
I see. Me?

1793
01:15:25,690 --> 01:15:27,820
- Yes, so I closed it. - Thank you so much.

1794
01:15:28,020 --> 01:15:29,791
Do you want a hand warmer?

1795
01:15:29,890 --> 01:15:31,631
No, you keep it. I'm fine.

1796
01:15:31,631 --> 01:15:33,430
- You don't need this... - No, I'm good on the hand warmer.

1797
01:15:33,430 --> 01:15:35,600
Touch it. You're going to want to use it.

1798
01:15:36,230 --> 01:15:37,631
You want it right? I have one too.

1799
01:15:37,831 --> 01:15:38,930
Thank you so much.

1800
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:42,471
- We'll each have... Yes. - We'll each have one?

1801
01:15:42,471 --> 01:15:44,371
We've met again. Sooner than expected.

1802
01:15:44,371 --> 01:15:45,541
You're not tired, are you?

1803
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:46,541
- Me? - Are you tired?

1804
01:15:46,541 --> 01:15:47,541
No,

1805
01:15:47,541 --> 01:15:48,610
- I slept well today. - Are you okay?

1806
01:15:49,411 --> 01:15:51,850
I think I feel great today.

1807
01:15:51,951 --> 01:15:56,951
It's cold, so I thought about just letting you go home,

1808
01:15:56,951 --> 01:16:00,390
but still, I thought we didn't talk enough.

1809
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:04,490
- So I requested to talk with you. - Gosh.

1810
01:16:07,001 --> 01:16:08,001
Cheers.

1811
01:16:12,501 --> 01:16:15,270
Recently, I’ve been feeling like...

1812
01:16:15,270 --> 01:16:18,610
I want to meet someone...

1813
01:16:18,940 --> 01:16:20,841
I can rely on.

1814
01:16:20,940 --> 01:16:25,150
It seemed like Yong Woo had the traits of someone like that.

1815
01:16:25,150 --> 01:16:29,020
I think that's why I felt comfortable with Yong Woo,

1816
01:16:29,020 --> 01:16:32,591
but also a little tense.

1817
01:16:32,690 --> 01:16:34,291
I think I chose him because...

1818
01:16:34,890 --> 01:16:37,091
he's someone I want to like,

1819
01:16:37,461 --> 01:16:41,001
someone I want to experience liking, and someone I want to date.

1820
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:42,631
Were you nervous on the first day?

1821
01:16:43,201 --> 01:16:46,201
Of course. I was nervous before entering the house.

1822
01:16:46,201 --> 01:16:48,171
I still remember how I felt.

1823
01:16:48,501 --> 01:16:50,610
I loosened up quicker than I had expected.

1824
01:16:51,471 --> 01:16:54,110
You feel like a veteran right now.

1825
01:16:54,110 --> 01:16:56,350
- Me? - The veteran of the house.

1826
01:16:56,451 --> 01:16:57,480
Are you ready?

1827
01:16:58,150 --> 01:16:59,881
Are you ready to introduce yourself and showcase your talents?

1828
01:16:59,881 --> 01:17:01,020
Showcase my talents?

1829
01:17:01,221 --> 01:17:03,520
Show me what you showcased first.

1830
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:06,291
Me? That's why I'm a veteran.

1831
01:17:06,591 --> 01:17:07,621
You can't see mine.

1832
01:17:07,621 --> 01:17:09,430
Wouldn't that be condescending of you?

1833
01:17:10,060 --> 01:17:12,030
- You got me. - You're being condescending.

1834
01:17:12,030 --> 01:17:13,100
You got me right here.

1835
01:17:15,801 --> 01:17:17,131
He's very different.

1836
01:17:17,430 --> 01:17:19,570
How he talks is different.

1837
01:17:19,801 --> 01:17:22,070
Do you have any talents to showcase? Are you good at anything?

1838
01:17:22,070 --> 01:17:23,671
No. I'm not good at anything.

1839
01:17:23,671 --> 01:17:25,041
You're saying no because you don't want to do it.

1840
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:27,341
I learned that this is how you deal with condescending people.

1841
01:17:27,780 --> 01:17:29,810
There must be a lot of them around you.

1842
01:17:30,081 --> 01:17:31,581
(Right here)

1843
01:17:32,451 --> 01:17:33,520
No comment.

1844
01:17:37,221 --> 01:17:39,251
It feels like I'm somehow drawn into Ji Won.

1845
01:17:39,251 --> 01:17:40,291
- Right, she has a magnetic charm. - Yes.

1846
01:17:40,291 --> 01:17:42,320
- Something about her. - When she speaks,

1847
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:43,461
I find myself focusing on her.

1848
01:17:43,860 --> 01:17:46,761
To be honest, I like to tease people.

1849
01:17:46,761 --> 01:17:48,530
- I like messing with people. - Messing with people.

1850
01:17:48,631 --> 01:17:50,100
You're very mean.

1851
01:17:50,201 --> 01:17:53,001
- No, I'm not mean. - You're such a mean person.

1852
01:17:53,270 --> 01:17:54,600
You teased me by saying I was condescending.

1853
01:17:54,801 --> 01:17:57,740
- Well, this could be tension, - Yes.

1854
01:17:57,841 --> 01:18:00,680
or it could be discomfort since I'm with a condescending person.

1855
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:02,881
Is there one nearby? I don't see any.

1856
01:18:03,211 --> 01:18:04,551
Is someone else here?

1857
01:18:04,551 --> 01:18:05,680
I thought it was just the two of us.

1858
01:18:05,850 --> 01:18:08,480
Do you hear that often? That you're condescending?

1859
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:09,791
I think this is the first time I'm hearing it.

1860
01:18:09,791 --> 01:18:11,150
- Really? - But it's rather funny...

1861
01:18:11,150 --> 01:18:12,350
- That can't be. - because of that.

1862
01:18:13,320 --> 01:18:14,390
Here you go again.

1863
01:18:15,291 --> 01:18:17,131
- So this is how it is. Got it. - Wait.

1864
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:19,860
- You're starting to tease me. - Yes.

1865
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:22,261
Condescending people are good at teasing.

1866
01:18:27,341 --> 01:18:29,270
- Wait. - I like this.

1867
01:18:29,270 --> 01:18:31,770
They're going back and forth between speaking casually and formally.

1868
01:18:31,770 --> 01:18:33,211
- Freely. - Back and forth.

1869
01:18:33,211 --> 01:18:34,310
He's showing off his charms.

1870
01:18:34,310 --> 01:18:35,381
- He's so charming. - It feels like there's...

1871
01:18:35,381 --> 01:18:37,081
nothing Yong Woo can't do.

1872
01:18:37,411 --> 01:18:38,911
I'm really getting drawn into him.

1873
01:18:39,011 --> 01:18:40,581
I like this side of him so much.

1874
01:18:40,721 --> 01:18:41,721
Patricia, are you into him?

1875
01:18:41,721 --> 01:18:43,520
I think I like this side of him.

1876
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:44,520
How so?

1877
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:46,360
- Doesn't he feel manly? - Like he's in control.

1878
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:48,190
Yes, like he's in control of the situation.

1879
01:18:48,190 --> 01:18:50,490
But we're not here to find your match, Patricia.

1880
01:18:50,591 --> 01:18:53,631
- So you should... - Right, I just meant he seems nice.

1881
01:18:53,730 --> 01:18:54,831
- I... - You have orange on your mouth.

1882
01:18:54,831 --> 01:18:56,230
What's going on?

1883
01:18:57,671 --> 01:18:59,371
- You could have told me in private. - Orange?

1884
01:19:00,371 --> 01:19:02,100
You have orange on your mouth.

1885
01:19:02,341 --> 01:19:04,211
- There's orange. I'll get it off. - It's cute.

1886
01:19:04,671 --> 01:19:06,180
That hurts. Stop it.

1887
01:19:07,140 --> 01:19:08,140
- It hurts? - Yes.

1888
01:19:08,810 --> 01:19:11,051
Between older, same age, and younger,

1889
01:19:11,411 --> 01:19:13,751
which age difference do you prefer?

1890
01:19:13,850 --> 01:19:15,581
I say it doesn't matter to me,

1891
01:19:15,581 --> 01:19:18,320
but in reality, I think I've dated older women a lot.

1892
01:19:18,421 --> 01:19:20,320
I don't know why exactly,

1893
01:19:20,421 --> 01:19:22,761
but looking back, I think that was the case.

1894
01:19:22,890 --> 01:19:25,390
Now that a little time has passed,

1895
01:19:25,791 --> 01:19:30,201
I don't think it's really that important anymore.

1896
01:19:30,301 --> 01:19:33,041
Do I seem older or younger?

1897
01:19:33,140 --> 01:19:35,270
You could be a lot younger than me in age,

1898
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:38,140
but something about the way you think and speak...

1899
01:19:38,511 --> 01:19:40,780
feels a little sophisticated.

1900
01:19:41,081 --> 01:19:43,251
- You wrapped it up nicely. - Was it all right?

1901
01:19:44,581 --> 01:19:45,650
- Nice. - It was a success.

1902
01:19:45,650 --> 01:19:46,680
That was nice.

1903
01:19:52,820 --> 01:19:53,820
What about me?

1904
01:19:56,091 --> 01:19:58,291
Something about you makes me feel like we're the same age.

1905
01:19:58,291 --> 01:19:59,801
- You think we're the same age? - Yes.

1906
01:19:59,900 --> 01:20:02,100
I feel neither uncomfortable nor comfortable.

1907
01:20:02,930 --> 01:20:04,701
That energy people who are the same age feel.

1908
01:20:05,730 --> 01:20:07,640
Then which one do you prefer?

1909
01:20:07,740 --> 01:20:11,411
I've never given much thought to guys who are younger,

1910
01:20:11,711 --> 01:20:13,541
but age isn't important.

1911
01:20:13,841 --> 01:20:15,110
- You sound like you're my age. - That's what...

1912
01:20:15,110 --> 01:20:16,381
- I know. - You're saying...

1913
01:20:16,381 --> 01:20:17,581
- the exact same thing I said. - We sound the same.

1914
01:20:17,581 --> 01:20:19,951
That's why I said I felt like we were the same age.

1915
01:20:20,051 --> 01:20:21,520
So you didn't just copy what I said just now?

1916
01:20:21,621 --> 01:20:24,890
No. I've been feeling the exact same way.

1917
01:20:24,990 --> 01:20:26,121
I think we'll be similar in age.

1918
01:20:26,121 --> 01:20:27,261
- You think we'll be similar in age? - Yes.

1919
01:20:27,661 --> 01:20:28,860
We'll see.

1920
01:20:33,161 --> 01:20:35,501
I almost forgot. It's supposed to snow tomorrow.

1921
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:38,171
- Right. I heard it's going to snow. - There's going to be snow tomorrow.

1922
01:20:38,570 --> 01:20:40,041
It'll be amazing if it really does.

1923
01:20:40,041 --> 01:20:41,070
Right.

1924
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:43,140
It'll be so pretty, right?

1925
01:20:43,371 --> 01:20:45,671
Cho A, are you just now eating?

1926
01:20:45,671 --> 01:20:47,640
- Yes. - Gosh.

1927
01:20:52,110 --> 01:20:53,150
Someone's here.

1928
01:20:55,850 --> 01:20:57,850
(It's not the one he's been waiting for.)

1929
01:20:58,591 --> 01:21:00,221
(Smiling awkwardly)

1930
01:21:02,860 --> 01:21:05,661
Jae Hyung is checking who comes in.

1931
01:21:05,761 --> 01:21:07,030
He knows someone has to arrive.

1932
01:21:07,030 --> 01:21:08,900
Yes, right. He's hoping it's Ji Won.

1933
01:21:12,631 --> 01:21:14,100
What? Are you making rice?

1934
01:21:15,701 --> 01:21:16,810
(He's almost like a meerkat.)

1935
01:21:18,041 --> 01:21:19,541
I guess she's not.

1936
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:23,180
- Mapo tofu? - What?

1937
01:21:23,480 --> 01:21:26,081
"Mapo tofu?" I mean, what did you say just now?

1938
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:28,280
- I guess she's not. - "I guess she's not."

1939
01:21:29,251 --> 01:21:31,091
- That was funny. - I must be hungry.

1940
01:21:31,091 --> 01:21:32,421
Maybe you're sleepy.

1941
01:21:32,421 --> 01:21:34,020
- Mapo tofu was funny. - That might be it.

1942
01:21:34,921 --> 01:21:36,430
Where's Yong Woo?

1943
01:21:36,831 --> 01:21:39,030
- He had some personal business. - I see.

1944
01:21:39,030 --> 01:21:40,161
It was really personal,

1945
01:21:40,161 --> 01:21:42,201
so he left in a hurry, all of a sudden.

1946
01:21:43,371 --> 01:21:45,471
Yong Woo didn't come home.

1947
01:21:45,930 --> 01:21:47,671
They kept saying something came up.

1948
01:21:47,671 --> 01:21:50,110
I was curious about what it could be,

1949
01:21:50,110 --> 01:21:52,541
and I was worried about him. That was how I felt.

1950
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:55,640
They believed me.

1951
01:21:56,211 --> 01:21:58,411
My acting was good at the time. It was really good.

1952
01:21:59,110 --> 01:22:01,350
- You must all be tired. - We're okay.

1953
01:22:01,980 --> 01:22:04,520
We all had a good time.

1954
01:22:06,190 --> 01:22:07,921
What? It's here.

1955
01:22:08,820 --> 01:22:12,560
(On the fifth day, who made your heart flutter?)

1956
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:15,131
(On the fifth day, who made your heart flutter?)

1957
01:22:17,030 --> 01:22:18,171
(Cho A sighs.)

1958
01:22:18,171 --> 01:22:21,070
(Typing)

1959
01:22:21,871 --> 01:22:23,841
(Someone is being loud again today.)

1960
01:22:24,270 --> 01:22:26,980
Who keeps typing loudly on their phone?

1961
01:22:27,610 --> 01:22:28,640
Me.

1962
01:22:30,251 --> 01:22:32,711
I just sent what I really felt.

1963
01:22:34,451 --> 01:22:36,721
I really wanted Yong Woo to return quickly.

1964
01:22:41,421 --> 01:22:43,230
I was quite conflicted.

1965
01:22:44,860 --> 01:22:47,400
I think I was conflicted for a second.

1966
01:22:47,730 --> 01:22:51,501
I just sent a message to the person I had feelings for.

1967
01:22:59,371 --> 01:23:00,841
What kind of food do you like?

1968
01:23:01,180 --> 01:23:02,310
I like spicy food.

1969
01:23:02,610 --> 01:23:04,680
What kind of spicy food is delicious?

1970
01:23:05,251 --> 01:23:06,951
Do you eat chicken feet?

1971
01:23:07,121 --> 01:23:08,881
I do eat boneless chicken feet.

1972
01:23:09,850 --> 01:23:11,121
What else is spicy?

1973
01:23:12,551 --> 01:23:13,560
What is this?

1974
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:17,961
We both got messages at the same time.

1975
01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:25,530
(On the fifth day, who made your heart flutter?)

1976
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:37,610
(Send the name and message, and we will deliver it anonymously.)

1977
01:23:37,610 --> 01:23:38,711
(On the fifth day, who made your heart flutter?)

1978
01:23:38,711 --> 01:23:39,881
(Send the name and message, and we will deliver it anonymously.)

1979
01:23:42,180 --> 01:23:45,251
(Yong Woo is having a hard time typing his message.)

1980
01:23:45,451 --> 01:23:47,461
He's conflicted because of Ji Won.

1981
01:23:47,690 --> 01:23:49,591
It used to be Cho A. His heart was set on Cho A.

1982
01:23:49,591 --> 01:23:50,930
Right, from the very beginning.

1983
01:23:51,591 --> 01:23:53,030
How would Cho A feel?

1984
01:23:53,030 --> 01:23:56,030
To be honest, he did talk to Ji Won a lot more today.

1985
01:23:56,030 --> 01:23:57,930
Yes. He could choose Ji Won for the day.

1986
01:23:57,930 --> 01:23:59,371
- Right. - They send messages every day.

1987
01:23:59,371 --> 01:24:00,371
Still.

1988
01:24:03,971 --> 01:24:05,711
(Smiling)

1989
01:24:06,581 --> 01:24:08,810
It takes me a while to understand.

1990
01:24:09,341 --> 01:24:10,751
There's someone called Cheol Hyeon.

1991
01:24:10,850 --> 01:24:13,751
- Yes. - Whenever we get messages,

1992
01:24:14,150 --> 01:24:15,180
we look at each other.

1993
01:24:16,150 --> 01:24:17,850
Is it like, "Did I get this right?"

1994
01:24:17,850 --> 01:24:20,761
No. It's about who's going to ask twice first.

1995
01:24:21,020 --> 01:24:24,331
(He's saying anything.)

1996
01:24:29,871 --> 01:24:32,430
(So far, there was no hesitation for him.)

1997
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:39,541
I think I was seriously conflicted at the time.

1998
01:24:51,690 --> 01:24:52,751
(To. Cho A)

1999
01:24:52,751 --> 01:24:55,990
(You did good...)

2000
01:24:58,030 --> 01:24:59,030
- Gosh. - Don't erase it.

2001
01:24:59,030 --> 01:25:01,161
He erased it.

2002
01:25:11,871 --> 01:25:12,971
(To. Ji W...)

2003
01:25:19,150 --> 01:25:22,421
(After thinking for a long time, he sends his message.)

2004
01:25:25,890 --> 01:25:29,221
(Everyone's feelings have been sent.)

2005
01:25:29,721 --> 01:25:31,461
What time's your presentation tomorrow?

2006
01:25:32,091 --> 01:25:35,100
By 11am tomorrow,

2007
01:25:35,201 --> 01:25:37,131
I have to be standing there.

2008
01:25:38,030 --> 01:25:39,301
Are you ready?

2009
01:25:39,801 --> 01:25:41,841
- I'm always ready. - Gosh.

2010
01:25:42,270 --> 01:25:44,671
- Always. - Always.

2011
01:25:45,740 --> 01:25:47,411
- That's cool. - That's amazing.

2012
01:25:47,411 --> 01:25:48,680
He sounds like a professor.

2013
01:25:48,780 --> 01:25:51,110
I'll be presenting about the research I've done...

2014
01:25:51,711 --> 01:25:54,121
- So you have it all in your head. - It's all in my head.

2015
01:25:54,121 --> 01:25:55,780
- Can you show us? - Goodness.

2016
01:25:56,221 --> 01:25:58,451
The goal of this recent research I've done...

2017
01:25:58,451 --> 01:25:59,820
is Lead Identification.

2018
01:25:59,820 --> 01:26:00,820
Gosh.

2019
01:26:01,690 --> 01:26:03,390
- He really did it for us. - Continue, please.

2020
01:26:03,390 --> 01:26:05,690
- "Lead?" - Lead Identification.

2021
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:08,560
Are you presenting in English?

2022
01:26:08,730 --> 01:26:11,631
I can present in Korean tomorrow, so it won't be too hard.

2023
01:26:12,131 --> 01:26:13,570
That's cool.

2024
01:26:13,770 --> 01:26:14,841
Let's check.

2025
01:26:16,541 --> 01:26:20,911
(I want to spend time with you.)

2026
01:26:21,011 --> 01:26:23,251
We were home, and we weren't doing anything,

2027
01:26:23,551 --> 01:26:25,650
so I thought we'd be able to spend a lot of time together.

2028
01:26:25,650 --> 01:26:27,280
But that didn't happen, so I was very disappointed.

2029
01:26:28,551 --> 01:26:30,091
If it snows tomorrow...

2030
01:26:31,921 --> 01:26:32,990
That's right.

2031
01:26:32,990 --> 01:26:35,990
(I'm looking forward to our date tomorrow!)

2032
01:26:36,261 --> 01:26:37,831
I sent mine to Se Seung. Yes.

2033
01:26:38,530 --> 01:26:42,030
We barely spent time together today, so I was disappointed.

2034
01:26:43,701 --> 01:26:46,270
(Jung Sub and Se Seung sent messages to each other.)

2035
01:26:46,301 --> 01:26:47,301
Gosh, now they're just...

2036
01:26:47,301 --> 01:26:48,801
Isn't she basically his girlfriend now?

2037
01:26:49,201 --> 01:26:50,911
Those two are very solid.

2038
01:26:50,911 --> 01:26:52,270
- I think so too. - I'm worried, though.

2039
01:26:52,371 --> 01:26:54,341
If it doesn't work out between them,

2040
01:26:54,341 --> 01:26:55,610
they could get hurt badly.

2041
01:26:57,110 --> 01:26:59,921
On my way here after work... Was it Shinsegae Department Store?

2042
01:26:59,921 --> 01:27:01,081
(Thank you for the book.)

2043
01:27:01,081 --> 01:27:02,251
(I will read it and leave a book report.)

2044
01:27:02,251 --> 01:27:05,251
I sent a message to Cheol Hyeon today.

2045
01:27:06,451 --> 01:27:09,761
I continued to feel like his feelings were hurt.

2046
01:27:10,030 --> 01:27:12,890
There were things I felt bad about and grateful for,

2047
01:27:12,890 --> 01:27:15,030
so I sent Cheol Hyeon a message.

2048
01:27:22,001 --> 01:27:23,610
As for the other days...

2049
01:27:24,211 --> 01:27:25,541
We can go out on Friday.

2050
01:27:26,411 --> 01:27:27,640
Monday and Thursday don't work.

2051
01:27:27,640 --> 01:27:30,680
(She waits, but doesn't get a message.)

2052
01:27:37,291 --> 01:27:39,091
I gave it some thought.

2053
01:27:39,961 --> 01:27:42,591
"Even if I end up changing my mind and complicating things,"

2054
01:27:42,721 --> 01:27:45,831
"I should follow my heart." I had that thought.

2055
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:48,600
Was he very disappointed?

2056
01:27:50,430 --> 01:27:52,070
Was there another reason?

2057
01:27:52,331 --> 01:27:54,070
Was he curious about someone else?

2058
01:27:54,570 --> 01:27:57,140
Did he develop an interest in someone else? I was curious,

2059
01:27:57,610 --> 01:27:58,770
but I didn't ask.

2060
01:27:58,770 --> 01:28:01,511
I didn't tell him about my honest feelings either.

2061
01:28:04,881 --> 01:28:10,020
(To whom did Cheol Hyeon deliver his feelings?)

2062
01:28:18,161 --> 01:28:20,161
I want to keep it gentle.

2063
01:28:22,001 --> 01:28:25,131
(How was your alone time today?)

2064
01:28:25,801 --> 01:28:29,541
I sent Se Seung a message to express my interest.

2065
01:28:30,070 --> 01:28:34,180
She read a lot of the book I gave her.

2066
01:28:34,980 --> 01:28:36,881
(The 2nd floor living room, this afternoon)

2067
01:28:37,350 --> 01:28:38,711
This book is fun.

2068
01:28:39,051 --> 01:28:40,051
Is it fun?

2069
01:28:40,951 --> 01:28:42,820
Please lend it to me after you are done.

2070
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:44,350
I will read it quickly.

2071
01:28:44,551 --> 01:28:45,690
Take your time.

2072
01:28:45,690 --> 01:28:47,190
No. I will read it quickly.

2073
01:28:50,190 --> 01:28:51,430
Read it quickly then.

2074
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:55,600
I am only human.

2075
01:28:55,900 --> 01:28:58,730
Since she showed an interest in something I gave her,

2076
01:28:59,171 --> 01:29:00,501
it was nice.

2077
01:29:00,801 --> 01:29:03,270
(Who do you think sent the message?)

2078
01:29:03,971 --> 01:29:04,971
Cheol Hyeon?

2079
01:29:06,041 --> 01:29:07,810
"When I spend time alone,"

2080
01:29:08,140 --> 01:29:09,980
"it's nice to read a book while enjoying the sunlight."

2081
01:29:09,980 --> 01:29:11,480
I told him that.

2082
01:29:12,381 --> 01:29:13,921
I was happy about the message,

2083
01:29:14,820 --> 01:29:15,850
but I also felt puzzled.

2084
01:29:16,850 --> 01:29:18,291
How did I make his heart flutter?

2085
01:29:19,890 --> 01:29:21,421
It was an unexpected vote.

2086
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:33,501
(Two people chose your sibling.)

2087
01:29:36,810 --> 01:29:40,640
I gave it a lot of thought.

2088
01:29:41,911 --> 01:29:43,711
One message must be from Jung Sub.

2089
01:29:45,211 --> 01:29:47,751
But I really don't know whom the other message is from.

2090
01:29:54,390 --> 01:29:58,161
(No one chose your sibling.)

2091
01:30:01,100 --> 01:30:03,230
I had this thought.

2092
01:30:03,900 --> 01:30:07,001
"Is there a change in Ju Yeon's thoughts?"

2093
01:30:07,770 --> 01:30:10,171
"A change in Ju Yeon's behaviours..."

2094
01:30:10,171 --> 01:30:12,770
"could have led to such results."

2095
01:30:13,211 --> 01:30:15,581
That thought occurred to me, and things became a bit interesting.

2096
01:30:34,430 --> 01:30:40,671
(I had so much fun today. Perhaps we are the same age.)

2097
01:30:41,801 --> 01:30:43,440
I think it was Ji Won...

2098
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:46,471
because she seemed to be the same age.

2099
01:30:46,471 --> 01:30:48,011
I sent it to Yong Woo.

2100
01:30:48,440 --> 01:30:51,680
Yong Woo seemed like someone who was the same age.

2101
01:30:51,810 --> 01:30:55,121
So I went, "Perhaps we are the same age."

2102
01:30:58,621 --> 01:31:00,921
(It's cold today, so rest in a warm place when you come home.)

2103
01:31:00,921 --> 01:31:03,390
(Let's listen to carols again when it snows tomorrow.)

2104
01:31:03,930 --> 01:31:06,690
We listened to carols as a group,

2105
01:31:07,001 --> 01:31:08,631
so I wondered who sent the message.

2106
01:31:08,900 --> 01:31:10,131
I think it's Cho A.

2107
01:31:10,301 --> 01:31:12,971
I sent a message to Yong Woo.

2108
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:17,341
We listened to carols on the day we had our first date.

2109
01:31:21,140 --> 01:31:23,211
What? Isn't it a Christmas carol?

2110
01:31:23,480 --> 01:31:24,751
Aren't we going to make a tree?

2111
01:31:24,911 --> 01:31:25,980
Shall we do that?

2112
01:31:26,110 --> 01:31:27,581
Shall we do that? Let's make a tree.

2113
01:31:27,581 --> 01:31:28,751
- That sounds nice. - A tree.

2114
01:31:29,121 --> 01:31:31,051
I have fond memories of that day.

2115
01:31:36,690 --> 01:31:39,490
(To whom did Yong Woo deliver his feelings today?)

2116
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:08,060
(You did well today.)

2117
01:32:08,060 --> 01:32:10,961
(You did well today.)

2118
01:32:11,761 --> 01:32:13,230
I sent a message to Cho A.

2119
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:16,400
He sent a message to Cho A.

2120
01:32:17,430 --> 01:32:19,801
- I got goosebumps. - I am so touched.

2121
01:32:20,201 --> 01:32:21,841
Seriously, Yong Woo...

2122
01:32:22,341 --> 01:32:24,240
- Yong Woo is different. - I know.

2123
01:32:24,911 --> 01:32:26,270
I sent a message to Cho A.

2124
01:32:26,980 --> 01:32:29,640
Ji Won is very charming,

2125
01:32:29,640 --> 01:32:31,810
and I have an interest in getting to know her more.

2126
01:32:32,110 --> 01:32:34,480
But I felt like I connected to Cho A...

2127
01:32:35,451 --> 01:32:37,591
more than Ji Won.

2128
01:32:37,990 --> 01:32:39,951
I will lend you a natural hot pack.

2129
01:32:40,761 --> 01:32:41,761
But to me,

2130
01:32:41,961 --> 01:32:43,990
it was a fascinating day.

2131
01:32:44,860 --> 01:32:45,930
I did it...

2132
01:32:47,030 --> 01:32:48,430
out of habit, so to speak.

2133
01:32:49,730 --> 01:32:54,841
Cho A's name came to me naturally.

2134
01:32:55,070 --> 01:32:56,471
But that day,

2135
01:32:57,471 --> 01:33:02,581
the message asking me who made my heart flutter today...

2136
01:33:03,011 --> 01:33:04,381
really made me think.

2137
01:33:04,850 --> 01:33:05,911
It was specified today.

2138
01:33:06,110 --> 01:33:08,621
Today, I didn't see Cho A once.

2139
01:33:09,020 --> 01:33:11,490
I only spent time with Ju Won.

2140
01:33:11,820 --> 01:33:13,421
There was a bit of a conflict.

2141
01:33:13,721 --> 01:33:15,121
So for the first time,

2142
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:18,091
I had to think hard.

2143
01:33:19,091 --> 01:33:22,730
In the previous messages, the sentences had wit.

2144
01:33:23,161 --> 01:33:26,270
They made me certain that there were from Yong Woo.

2145
01:33:26,530 --> 01:33:27,701
They were like that.

2146
01:33:28,100 --> 01:33:30,240
But I couldn't guess the sender this time.

2147
01:33:31,770 --> 01:33:33,940
It was a bit puzzling.

2148
01:33:35,211 --> 01:33:36,411
What is this?

2149
01:33:37,780 --> 01:33:40,921
The warmth she always received from him disappeared.

2150
01:33:41,150 --> 01:33:42,451
That detail disappeared.

2151
01:33:42,721 --> 01:33:43,850
- The detail. - I got goosebumps.

2152
01:33:43,921 --> 01:33:45,650
Women's hunch is incredible.

2153
01:33:45,820 --> 01:33:48,091
He used to put his emotions...

2154
01:33:48,091 --> 01:33:49,461
- into the messages. - That's right.

2155
01:33:49,690 --> 01:33:51,860
- But the new message was very dry. - That's right.

2156
01:33:51,860 --> 01:33:52,890
It made her think, "What's this?"

2157
01:33:52,890 --> 01:33:54,860
Isn't it okay to send, "You did well today?"

2158
01:33:54,860 --> 01:33:55,860
- No. - He wasn't like that before.

2159
01:33:55,860 --> 01:33:57,331
Think about the messages he sent before.

2160
01:33:57,331 --> 01:33:59,301
- That's right. Yong Woo... - He always looked after her...

2161
01:33:59,301 --> 01:34:01,240
- with consideration. - You are right.

2162
01:34:01,341 --> 01:34:03,201
She should have known then and there.

2163
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:04,971
"This jerk is with another woman."

2164
01:34:06,270 --> 01:34:07,511
She should have known right away.

2165
01:34:07,810 --> 01:34:09,711
- That's right. - Come on.

2166
01:34:09,711 --> 01:34:11,911
That's right. The day before, he sent a message about...

2167
01:34:11,911 --> 01:34:14,721
- his side fat and such. - You are right.

2168
01:34:14,881 --> 01:34:17,051
As he conveyed the message of "I chose you,"

2169
01:34:17,051 --> 01:34:21,020
he made an effort to be witty and make Cho A laugh...

2170
01:34:21,020 --> 01:34:22,261
- in his text. - That's right.

2171
01:34:22,520 --> 01:34:24,331
Today, it was just, "You did well today."

2172
01:34:24,331 --> 01:34:25,730
Yes. She thought it was puzzling.

2173
01:34:25,730 --> 01:34:27,001
"What's up with him?"

2174
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:28,430
"You did well today" is...

2175
01:34:28,430 --> 01:34:30,161
a message I get from Korea Music Copyright Association.

2176
01:34:30,161 --> 01:34:31,701
- That's right. - Seriously.

2177
01:34:32,070 --> 01:34:33,430
He said it was out of habit.

2178
01:34:33,430 --> 01:34:34,770
He always wrote Cho A.

2179
01:34:34,770 --> 01:34:36,140
But he erased it.

2180
01:34:36,371 --> 01:34:37,610
For the first time that day,

2181
01:34:37,610 --> 01:34:38,871
- he went, "Is this right?" - He began...

2182
01:34:39,640 --> 01:34:41,640
- He began to rethink his choice. - He became thoughtful.

2183
01:34:42,940 --> 01:34:44,650
Had they received the instruction 30 minutes later,

2184
01:34:44,650 --> 01:34:45,911
things might have been different.

2185
01:34:51,091 --> 01:34:54,291
(I am disappointed that our time was short and cold.)

2186
01:34:54,291 --> 01:34:56,560
(Let's talk next time.)

2187
01:34:57,060 --> 01:34:58,161
Still,

2188
01:34:58,791 --> 01:35:00,131
I received one.

2189
01:35:00,930 --> 01:35:04,471
To be honest, I thought no one would give me a message.

2190
01:35:04,471 --> 01:35:07,570
I was very thankful that someone did.

2191
01:35:08,940 --> 01:35:09,940
I think...

2192
01:35:11,541 --> 01:35:14,310
it's from Jung Sub.

2193
01:35:14,310 --> 01:35:18,310
He is someone I talked to for the shortest amount of time.

2194
01:35:18,980 --> 01:35:20,680
I messaged Ji Won.

2195
01:35:21,320 --> 01:35:24,291
I just messaged someone I wanted to message.

2196
01:35:24,751 --> 01:35:27,721
I wanted to talk to her.

2197
01:35:28,320 --> 01:35:31,930
She has a similar vibe compared to my ex-girlfriend.

2198
01:35:32,331 --> 01:35:36,360
But she must be different.

2199
01:35:36,360 --> 01:35:38,900
To be honest, I want to check that.

2200
01:35:39,930 --> 01:35:41,900
Did you watch it?

2201
01:35:42,671 --> 01:35:44,240
- Yes, I did. - Did you watch it?

2202
01:35:45,011 --> 01:35:48,680
(Welcome back home. I hope your allergy gets better.)

2203
01:35:48,680 --> 01:35:50,911
I sent a message to Jae Hyung.

2204
01:35:51,381 --> 01:35:55,221
I liked the date we had together.

2205
01:35:55,221 --> 01:35:57,990
I also think...

2206
01:35:57,990 --> 01:35:59,721
we will get along.

2207
01:35:59,820 --> 01:36:01,121
So I sent him another message.

2208
01:36:06,990 --> 01:36:10,100
(All messages have been sent. Have a good night.)

2209
01:36:10,900 --> 01:36:15,801
(No one chose your sibling.)

2210
01:36:16,140 --> 01:36:17,541
All right.

2211
01:36:19,971 --> 01:36:21,911
There were no events.

2212
01:36:21,911 --> 01:36:25,850
So a part of me thought...

2213
01:36:25,850 --> 01:36:27,381
that it was understandable.

2214
01:36:27,980 --> 01:36:29,480
We are only on our fifth day.

2215
01:36:30,081 --> 01:36:32,520
There will be a lot of opportunities.

2216
01:36:38,930 --> 01:36:41,001
- It's time to go. - Yes.

2217
01:36:41,701 --> 01:36:43,461
I will go now...

2218
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:45,001
and meet the female participants.

2219
01:36:45,001 --> 01:36:47,070
You are right. You will meet everyone.

2220
01:36:47,070 --> 01:36:49,301
- It will be fun. - That's right.

2221
01:36:50,440 --> 01:36:53,841
Yong Woo is a cool person.

2222
01:36:53,841 --> 01:36:57,911
He showed a sense of humour like a friend at times,

2223
01:36:58,011 --> 01:37:00,680
so spending time with him was fun and comfortable.

2224
01:37:00,680 --> 01:37:04,791
But it wasn't complete comfort. There was...

2225
01:37:04,791 --> 01:37:07,890
a good kind of tension.

2226
01:37:07,890 --> 01:37:10,360
It was very nice.

2227
01:37:10,831 --> 01:37:13,131
I had fun until the late hours.

2228
01:37:13,131 --> 01:37:15,761
I had fun thanks to you too.

2229
01:37:18,430 --> 01:37:20,871
(They walk out of the building amidst the wind storm.)

2230
01:37:20,871 --> 01:37:22,841
- I think that's the car. - I see.

2231
01:37:23,001 --> 01:37:25,711
- Is that car yours? - It's very...

2232
01:37:25,711 --> 01:37:27,180
- Okay. - Small.

2233
01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:28,310
It's cute.

2234
01:37:28,810 --> 01:37:30,041
It's small and precious.

2235
01:37:30,240 --> 01:37:31,511
- It's small and precious. - Watch the car.

2236
01:37:32,911 --> 01:37:35,280
This way. I will get in the other way.

2237
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:36,280
Okay.

2238
01:37:38,520 --> 01:37:40,051
I will scoot over.

2239
01:37:40,051 --> 01:37:41,291
- Will you do that? - Yes.

2240
01:37:42,060 --> 01:37:43,690
It will be cramped.

2241
01:37:47,930 --> 01:37:49,961
- Go inside first. - I will do that.

2242
01:37:50,001 --> 01:37:51,301
- See you inside. - Take a half-bath too.

2243
01:37:51,301 --> 01:37:53,570
- Okay. Thank you. - Go on in.

2244
01:38:00,610 --> 01:38:03,581
(Yong Woo returns.)

2245
01:38:05,251 --> 01:38:06,850
It can't be easy to do that.

2246
01:38:06,850 --> 01:38:08,150
It's Yong Woo.

2247
01:38:08,221 --> 01:38:10,020
- What? - Is it Yong Woo?

2248
01:38:11,190 --> 01:38:13,251
- Did the work end well? - Did you take care of it well?

2249
01:38:13,251 --> 01:38:14,921
You left in a hurry.

2250
01:38:14,921 --> 01:38:16,490
Were all of you guys...

2251
01:38:16,490 --> 01:38:17,990
waiting for me?

2252
01:38:18,131 --> 01:38:19,490
You cried somewhere, right?

2253
01:38:19,730 --> 01:38:20,801
- Me? - Yes.

2254
01:38:20,900 --> 01:38:22,631
When I checked my pocket,

2255
01:38:22,631 --> 01:38:24,171
I saw the letter from yesterday.

2256
01:38:24,871 --> 01:38:26,331
- I... - You kept it.

2257
01:38:26,331 --> 01:38:28,240
I couldn't help but cry again.

2258
01:38:29,140 --> 01:38:32,270
He left saying that it was a personal matter.

2259
01:38:32,270 --> 01:38:33,310
He left like this.

2260
01:38:33,411 --> 01:38:35,911
You guys are so mean.

2261
01:38:36,211 --> 01:38:38,011
It's no joke.

2262
01:38:38,310 --> 01:38:41,150
(How did it feel when Yong Woo came home?)

2263
01:38:41,251 --> 01:38:42,421
I was happy to see him.

2264
01:38:44,690 --> 01:38:47,221
(After checking her hoodie,)

2265
01:38:48,520 --> 01:38:50,791
(she comes downstairs with a smile.)

2266
01:38:54,001 --> 01:38:55,161
That's right.

2267
01:38:55,560 --> 01:38:56,701
That's right.

2268
01:38:57,801 --> 01:38:59,471
- Where did you go? - Me?

2269
01:38:59,471 --> 01:39:02,440
I had to take care of a business.

2270
01:39:03,341 --> 01:39:05,511
- Are you okay? - Now? I am okay.

2271
01:39:05,810 --> 01:39:07,041
I am okay.

2272
01:39:07,280 --> 01:39:10,680
You are wearing comfortable clothes today.

2273
01:39:10,911 --> 01:39:12,110
You are wearing a hoodie.

2274
01:39:12,881 --> 01:39:14,180
It's my first time seeing you wear a hoodie.

2275
01:39:14,180 --> 01:39:15,980
That's right. It's your first time.

2276
01:39:15,980 --> 01:39:17,850
(She is happy that she tidied up clothes before.)

2277
01:39:18,421 --> 01:39:20,190
The hoodie makes your neck appear...

2278
01:39:20,190 --> 01:39:21,261
really slim.

2279
01:39:21,261 --> 01:39:23,020
- Really? - It's a boxy hoodie.

2280
01:39:23,860 --> 01:39:26,860
Gosh, she waited for him.

2281
01:39:26,860 --> 01:39:28,331
- How nice. - She received a message too.

2282
01:39:30,430 --> 01:39:32,400
Ju Yeon, when did you come today?

2283
01:39:32,631 --> 01:39:35,201
I worked until late today, so I came at 9pm.

2284
01:39:35,341 --> 01:39:36,371
At 9pm?

2285
01:39:36,740 --> 01:39:38,440
It's at Sinyongsan.

2286
01:39:40,841 --> 01:39:42,041
Sinyongsan.

2287
01:39:42,541 --> 01:39:44,411
Did you come at 10pm today as well?

2288
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:48,320
Today, I came past 10:30pm.

2289
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:51,051
Aren't you exhausted? I would be...

2290
01:39:51,051 --> 01:39:52,121
so exhausted.

2291
01:39:52,121 --> 01:39:53,520
- I am exhausted. - Seriously.

2292
01:39:53,990 --> 01:39:55,690
In which neighbourhood is your workplace located?

2293
01:39:55,690 --> 01:39:56,791
City Hall.

2294
01:39:57,631 --> 01:39:59,030
- City Hall. - City Hall.

2295
01:40:01,100 --> 01:40:02,400
- It's close to my workplace. - City Hall.

2296
01:40:04,070 --> 01:40:06,201
- Are we in there as well? - I am not sure.

2297
01:40:07,070 --> 01:40:08,600
Cho A, are you good at gonggi?

2298
01:40:08,600 --> 01:40:11,011
Gonggi? I haven't played it in a long while.

2299
01:40:11,740 --> 01:40:13,711
My hand... Let me try it.

2300
01:40:14,310 --> 01:40:16,440
Back in the day, I held the pieces like this...

2301
01:40:16,711 --> 01:40:18,480
at Two Years.

2302
01:40:18,850 --> 01:40:20,350
- Two Years. - That's right.

2303
01:40:20,350 --> 01:40:23,051
- I haven't heard that in a while. - Two Years.

2304
01:40:23,051 --> 01:40:24,121
(The game brings back memories.)

2305
01:40:24,121 --> 01:40:26,721
There were so many fun games.

2306
01:40:28,461 --> 01:40:30,490
- Let's go. - What is it?

2307
01:40:31,661 --> 01:40:33,230
It's late at night.

2308
01:40:33,831 --> 01:40:34,930
Is there something else?

2309
01:40:35,060 --> 01:40:37,100
Come upstairs.

2310
01:40:40,530 --> 01:40:42,600
We just received this.

2311
01:40:42,671 --> 01:40:43,871
- It just arrived. - Did something come?

2312
01:40:43,871 --> 01:40:45,810
- Did the doorbell ring? - Yes.

2313
01:40:47,011 --> 01:40:48,411
- Is it a new one? - Yes.

2314
01:40:48,411 --> 01:40:49,740
It just arrived.

2315
01:40:53,951 --> 01:40:56,251
"A new participant who chose Yong Woo..."

2316
01:40:56,251 --> 01:40:57,721
- "as a date..." - I knew it.

2317
01:40:57,721 --> 01:40:59,551
- "arrived at the door." - I knew someone would come.

2318
01:40:59,551 --> 01:41:01,661
"Please go to the door and welcome her."

2319
01:41:30,421 --> 01:41:31,921
There is a new participant.

2320
01:41:32,251 --> 01:41:33,751
- Let's hurry up and go. - Really?

2321
01:41:33,751 --> 01:41:34,860
- Really? - Let's hurry up and go.

2322
01:41:34,860 --> 01:41:36,560
"And welcome her."

2323
01:41:36,560 --> 01:41:38,890
- How does she know Yong Woo? - Who is she?

2324
01:41:39,291 --> 01:41:41,131
What's going on?

2325
01:41:56,381 --> 01:41:57,480
It's so...

2326
01:41:57,581 --> 01:41:59,251
- It's so exciting. - What?

2327
01:41:59,581 --> 01:42:01,480
(She becomes startled and runs away.)

2328
01:42:02,180 --> 01:42:04,081
- I knew it. - Hello.

2329
01:42:05,150 --> 01:42:07,560
- Hello. - Hello.

2330
01:42:07,591 --> 01:42:09,490
- Come on in. - It's nice to meet you.

2331
01:42:09,490 --> 01:42:10,690
- Hello. - Come on in.

2332
01:42:10,690 --> 01:42:12,291
- Hello. - Hello.

2333
01:42:12,291 --> 01:42:13,360
Hello.

2334
01:42:13,360 --> 01:42:15,201
I saw people rush over...

2335
01:42:15,201 --> 01:42:17,161
and wondered if I should run.

2336
01:42:17,400 --> 01:42:19,400
- Hello. - Come on in.

2337
01:42:19,400 --> 01:42:20,501
Hello.

2338
01:42:20,671 --> 01:42:22,270
- Hello. - Hello.

2339
01:42:22,270 --> 01:42:23,501
- Hello. - Hello.

2340
01:42:23,801 --> 01:42:24,940
What's your name?

2341
01:42:24,940 --> 01:42:27,011
- My name is Ji Won. - It's nice to meet you.

2342
01:42:27,011 --> 01:42:28,511
- Welcome. - Thank you.

2343
01:42:28,511 --> 01:42:29,740
Welcome.

2344
01:42:30,711 --> 01:42:32,680
- You must have been nervous. - Seriously.

2345
01:42:32,680 --> 01:42:35,081
You are nervous, right? Sit down. Put yourself at ease.

2346
01:42:35,581 --> 01:42:36,850
My first impression of her was...

2347
01:42:38,350 --> 01:42:41,060
that she seemed haughty.

2348
01:42:41,291 --> 01:42:43,721
She is very hip and stylish.

2349
01:42:44,161 --> 01:42:45,831
A very pretty woman...

2350
01:42:45,890 --> 01:42:48,430
who resembled a cat was standing there.

2351
01:42:48,430 --> 01:42:49,530
She seemed like a cold city girl.

2352
01:42:50,060 --> 01:42:52,201
She seemed like a woman...

2353
01:42:52,631 --> 01:42:54,371
with an unrivalled aura.

2354
01:42:54,740 --> 01:42:57,810
I thought that she was my brother's type...

2355
01:42:58,270 --> 01:42:59,511
the moment I saw her.

2356
01:43:00,341 --> 01:43:02,341
- She realized it right away. - Seriously.

2357
01:43:03,011 --> 01:43:04,551
He said she resembled his ex-girlfriend.

2358
01:43:04,711 --> 01:43:05,780
How scary.

2359
01:43:06,451 --> 01:43:07,721
Yes.

2360
01:43:07,721 --> 01:43:10,121
- Welcome. - Welcome.

2361
01:43:10,121 --> 01:43:11,451
Thank you.

2362
01:43:12,020 --> 01:43:14,461
I thought you would be asleep.

2363
01:43:14,661 --> 01:43:16,860
- We were waiting for you. - Really?

2364
01:43:16,990 --> 01:43:19,331
- I am glad I didn't go to bed. - Seriously.

2365
01:43:19,461 --> 01:43:20,761
Thank you.

2366
01:43:20,961 --> 01:43:24,971
How did you know Yong Woo and pick him?

2367
01:43:25,371 --> 01:43:26,900
Are you supposed to keep it a secret?

2368
01:43:30,701 --> 01:43:32,310
Well...

2369
01:43:32,310 --> 01:43:35,041
- To be completely honest, - Can you tell us?

2370
01:43:35,110 --> 01:43:38,310
we said hello earlier.

2371
01:43:38,310 --> 01:43:40,711
- Really? - I met men one at a time.

2372
01:43:40,711 --> 01:43:44,121
I knew something was up.

2373
01:43:44,121 --> 01:43:45,921
Only men knew about it.

2374
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:48,520
That made me go...

2375
01:43:48,520 --> 01:43:50,020
(I see.)

2376
01:43:50,020 --> 01:43:51,161
It was like that.

2377
01:43:51,390 --> 01:43:53,860
How else would she suddenly choose Yong Woo?

2378
01:43:53,860 --> 01:43:55,430
She had met him.

2379
01:43:55,661 --> 01:43:57,400
The puzzle pieces came together.

2380
01:43:57,631 --> 01:44:00,730
It was a bit like, "I can't believe these punks."

2381
01:44:01,841 --> 01:44:03,701
Everyone seemed to be surprised,

2382
01:44:04,070 --> 01:44:08,511
but my sister showed big reactions.

2383
01:44:09,110 --> 01:44:12,711
(His sister's reactions in 3 steps)

2384
01:44:13,251 --> 01:44:15,520
She was like this.

2385
01:44:16,751 --> 01:44:19,820
It was fun to watch her.

2386
01:44:20,551 --> 01:44:22,190
I thought Ju Yeon's eyes...

2387
01:44:22,190 --> 01:44:23,921
would pop out.

2388
01:44:24,221 --> 01:44:25,560
(He watched from the 1st row.)

2389
01:44:25,560 --> 01:44:29,331
"A new participant who chose Yong Woo as a date..."

2390
01:44:29,430 --> 01:44:31,201
"arrived at the door."

2391
01:44:31,201 --> 01:44:33,100
"Please go to the door and welcome her."

2392
01:44:35,640 --> 01:44:37,341
It's funny when you know it.

2393
01:44:37,440 --> 01:44:38,940
It's like a sitcom.

2394
01:44:40,110 --> 01:44:41,110
My goodness.

2395
01:44:41,810 --> 01:44:44,411
- I met them one at a time. - One at a time?

2396
01:44:45,711 --> 01:44:48,150
- Yes. - One at a time.

2397
01:44:49,350 --> 01:44:51,951
I see. Okay.

2398
01:44:52,451 --> 01:44:53,721
At first,

2399
01:44:53,721 --> 01:44:56,520
I thought they had met together.

2400
01:44:56,520 --> 01:44:58,791
But she had talked to them 1 at a time for 10 minutes.

2401
01:44:59,230 --> 01:45:01,661
So I had two thoughts.

2402
01:45:01,661 --> 01:45:02,730
"One at a time?"

2403
01:45:03,360 --> 01:45:05,100
The 2nd one was, "Just 10 minutes?"

2404
01:45:06,471 --> 01:45:08,100
I don't know if I should be relieved.

2405
01:45:11,511 --> 01:45:12,511
I was a bit flustered.

2406
01:45:12,511 --> 01:45:14,511
I was like, "How did they know?"

2407
01:45:14,511 --> 01:45:17,211
You had received a letter.

2408
01:45:19,581 --> 01:45:21,421
When I saw her,

2409
01:45:21,421 --> 01:45:24,650
I thought that Jung Sub might like her.

2410
01:45:24,890 --> 01:45:28,890
She isn't the type Jung Sub usually dates.

2411
01:45:28,890 --> 01:45:30,221
But...

2412
01:45:30,761 --> 01:45:33,631
she is the type Jung Sub wants to date,

2413
01:45:33,631 --> 01:45:34,661
I think.

2414
01:45:36,961 --> 01:45:39,600
Yong Woo was the one...

2415
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:41,140
she picked from the start.

2416
01:45:41,471 --> 01:45:45,041
To both of them, the date... Maybe not both of them.

2417
01:45:45,041 --> 01:45:47,140
To the woman,

2418
01:45:47,780 --> 01:45:50,341
the date must have been nice.

2419
01:45:52,381 --> 01:45:55,480
I thought that might be the case.

2420
01:45:55,621 --> 01:45:58,121
He is the man who looks good in my eyes,

2421
01:45:58,291 --> 01:46:01,461
so it might be the same for other people.

2422
01:46:05,730 --> 01:46:09,930
I didn't think Cho A was bothered...

2423
01:46:09,930 --> 01:46:12,900
because it was Ji Won's choice.

2424
01:46:12,900 --> 01:46:14,331
It was Ji Won's choice.

2425
01:46:14,600 --> 01:46:18,640
What would Yong Woo think...

2426
01:46:18,640 --> 01:46:22,740
about the new participant, Ji Won?

2427
01:46:24,240 --> 01:46:25,911
Does he find her favourable?

2428
01:46:26,911 --> 01:46:29,820
Perhaps the first impression wasn't that great.

2429
01:46:31,591 --> 01:46:34,190
Yong Woo is the one who will be my brother-in-law.

2430
01:46:34,591 --> 01:46:36,421
He is one of the candidates.

2431
01:46:36,721 --> 01:46:39,430
My sister can't lose him.

2432
01:46:43,930 --> 01:46:46,600
I hope my sister hurries up and goes on a date with him.

2433
01:46:47,331 --> 01:46:49,740
I need to see her go on a date with Yong Woo...

2434
01:46:51,171 --> 01:46:52,310
to alleviate this resentment.

2435
01:46:57,310 --> 01:46:59,980
All the male participants said...

2436
01:47:00,150 --> 01:47:03,221
that the female participants were very nice.

2437
01:47:03,551 --> 01:47:04,751
So I came here with ease.

2438
01:47:05,591 --> 01:47:07,150
The house is very nice.

2439
01:47:07,150 --> 01:47:08,291
- It's pretty, right? - It's nice.

2440
01:47:08,291 --> 01:47:09,490
- Why don't you have a house tour? - Why don't you have a house tour?

2441
01:47:09,490 --> 01:47:10,961
- That's right. - Let's have a house tour.

2442
01:47:10,961 --> 01:47:13,360
(She first checks out the pride of the house, the basement hideout.)

2443
01:47:13,761 --> 01:47:14,801
This is incredible.

2444
01:47:14,900 --> 01:47:16,661
This is the Telephone Room.

2445
01:47:16,661 --> 01:47:18,570
The Telephone Room. Who can we call?

2446
01:47:18,770 --> 01:47:21,001
We can call whomever we want.

2447
01:47:21,001 --> 01:47:22,740
We can call our parents.

2448
01:47:23,201 --> 01:47:25,110
That's your bed.

2449
01:47:26,371 --> 01:47:27,780
When will you unpack?

2450
01:47:29,980 --> 01:47:31,911
You should go and wash up now.

2451
01:47:32,110 --> 01:47:34,520
I am going to go to bed right away.

2452
01:47:34,520 --> 01:47:37,051
(People who need to go to work get ready for bed.)

2453
01:47:38,251 --> 01:47:40,251
Hold on. We should write her name.

2454
01:47:40,490 --> 01:47:42,421
- That's right. - Look over here.

2455
01:47:42,961 --> 01:47:43,990
Now,

2456
01:47:44,930 --> 01:47:46,890
- we need tissue paper. - Tissue paper?

2457
01:47:46,890 --> 01:47:48,600
- Please bring it. - Tissue paper?

2458
01:47:48,801 --> 01:47:49,860
From where?

2459
01:47:51,570 --> 01:47:52,631
I am ordering you around.

2460
01:47:52,871 --> 01:47:55,171
To keep the spacing consistent,

2461
01:47:55,171 --> 01:47:57,001
we should erase everything.

2462
01:47:59,171 --> 01:48:01,280
I don't need to write it prettily, do I?

2463
01:48:02,511 --> 01:48:04,511
- You need to write it prettily. - Really?

2464
01:48:04,511 --> 01:48:06,180
Yes. Do you go to work tomorrow?

2465
01:48:06,581 --> 01:48:09,081
I have a brief meeting, but...

2466
01:48:09,081 --> 01:48:10,081
A meeting.

2467
01:48:12,121 --> 01:48:14,320
I wrote it like this. Do I get a pass?

2468
01:48:14,451 --> 01:48:16,360
My goodness. What was that?

2469
01:48:16,921 --> 01:48:18,060
- She thinks it's a nuisance. - What was that?

2470
01:48:18,060 --> 01:48:19,690
What was that smirk?

2471
01:48:19,690 --> 01:48:20,690
Hold on.

2472
01:48:20,690 --> 01:48:23,100
- The angle was so funny. - It looked like...

2473
01:48:23,100 --> 01:48:24,900
she was thinking, "Give me a break."

2474
01:48:24,900 --> 01:48:26,230
Se Seung is a bit...

2475
01:48:26,230 --> 01:48:28,371
- Se Seung is annoyed. - She is jealous.

2476
01:48:28,371 --> 01:48:29,541
- It bothers her. - "What is going on?"

2477
01:48:30,240 --> 01:48:31,270
- I think it looks nice. - Hold on.

2478
01:48:32,110 --> 01:48:33,110
Where is it?

2479
01:48:35,581 --> 01:48:36,610
You failed.

2480
01:48:38,780 --> 01:48:40,280
How could you say that?

2481
01:48:40,980 --> 01:48:43,251
I wrote it well.

2482
01:48:43,251 --> 01:48:44,421
(Ji Won)

2483
01:48:44,421 --> 01:48:46,190
- It's nice. - It's nice.

2484
01:48:46,791 --> 01:48:48,221
I will go and wash up.

2485
01:48:48,791 --> 01:48:51,190
I need to go to bed early today.

2486
01:48:51,190 --> 01:48:52,360
That's right.

2487
01:48:52,930 --> 01:48:54,390
Go and wash up.

2488
01:48:55,230 --> 01:48:57,530
Yong Woo is lucky.

2489
01:48:57,530 --> 01:48:59,770
- What? - Yong Woo is lucky.

2490
01:49:02,371 --> 01:49:03,841
I am jealous.

2491
01:49:05,740 --> 01:49:08,640
(The house fairy wants to hang out with the new participant.)

2492
01:49:08,640 --> 01:49:11,411
Can I ask you why you chose Yong Woo?

2493
01:49:11,581 --> 01:49:12,650
Well,

2494
01:49:13,110 --> 01:49:16,081
he was the last one I talked to.

2495
01:49:16,421 --> 01:49:19,520
It seemed like the conversation ended fast.

2496
01:49:19,520 --> 01:49:22,690
- You were disappointed. - I felt like it got cut off.

2497
01:49:23,560 --> 01:49:25,661
(Yun Ha joins them.)

2498
01:49:26,490 --> 01:49:31,131
Welcome to the Study Time on Ji Won.

2499
01:49:31,930 --> 01:49:36,301
Then you didn't have a group meeting,

2500
01:49:36,301 --> 01:49:37,911
- just 1-on-1 meetings. - That's right.

2501
01:49:37,911 --> 01:49:40,310
- That's right. - It must have been very awkward.

2502
01:49:40,640 --> 01:49:41,640
Yes.

2503
01:49:43,081 --> 01:49:45,951
What am I going to do if I already feel this way?

2504
01:49:46,110 --> 01:49:47,110
It's okay.

2505
01:49:47,211 --> 01:49:49,280
It's only your first day.

2506
01:49:49,280 --> 01:49:51,591
The first day is very hectic.

2507
01:49:52,721 --> 01:49:55,820
From the second day onward, it becomes insanely fun.

2508
01:49:56,291 --> 01:49:59,591
You adjusted well in five days.

2509
01:49:59,890 --> 01:50:01,761
In any case, our siblings are here.

2510
01:50:01,761 --> 01:50:05,270
So the atmosphere is set up to bring us close.

2511
01:50:06,471 --> 01:50:08,940
Everyone is warmhearted. Seriously.

2512
01:50:09,801 --> 01:50:14,140
The female participant I get along with...

2513
01:50:14,140 --> 01:50:17,480
is Se Seung,

2514
01:50:17,610 --> 01:50:19,480
I think.

2515
01:50:19,480 --> 01:50:21,820
The participant my brother would like...

2516
01:50:23,180 --> 01:50:24,180
is Yun Ha.

2517
01:50:25,150 --> 01:50:26,551
Her eyes...

2518
01:50:26,551 --> 01:50:28,820
Her eyes are very pretty when she laughs.

2519
01:50:28,820 --> 01:50:30,820
She has a bright energy.

2520
01:50:30,820 --> 01:50:33,131
But she seems to have...

2521
01:50:33,131 --> 01:50:36,331
sturdiness and strength inside.

2522
01:50:36,560 --> 01:50:39,400
I think my brother will get along with her...

2523
01:50:40,301 --> 01:50:41,371
and like her very much.

2524
01:50:42,471 --> 01:50:43,541
I had that thought.

2525
01:50:43,900 --> 01:50:46,140
(Who do you think are siblings?)

2526
01:50:46,971 --> 01:50:51,411
I think Jung Sub and Se Seung are siblings.

2527
01:50:52,280 --> 01:50:55,320
One time, I set between them.

2528
01:50:56,280 --> 01:50:58,690
The alarm didn't go off.

2529
01:50:59,591 --> 01:51:00,591
Give it to me.

2530
01:51:01,490 --> 01:51:03,591
No, it's set up correctly.

2531
01:51:03,591 --> 01:51:05,261
- Maybe you slept through it. - Really?

2532
01:51:05,930 --> 01:51:09,860
They definitely spoke to each other with the siblings' tone.

2533
01:51:10,131 --> 01:51:13,930
So I was showing a meaningful smile.

2534
01:51:16,001 --> 01:51:17,400
They are getting to know each other.

2535
01:51:17,400 --> 01:51:19,011
- They aren't siblings. - She thinks they are siblings.

2536
01:51:19,011 --> 01:51:20,971
It must be really confusing.

2537
01:51:21,310 --> 01:51:23,841
Okay. See Ya.

2538
01:51:24,081 --> 01:51:25,911
- See Ya. - Bye.

2539
01:51:25,911 --> 01:51:27,581
Have a good night.

2540
01:51:28,650 --> 01:51:30,721
I think the two of them are...

2541
01:51:30,881 --> 01:51:32,890
siblings.

2542
01:51:34,721 --> 01:51:37,520
- You have gone on a date, right? - Yes.

2543
01:51:37,761 --> 01:51:38,761
How was it?

2544
01:51:39,360 --> 01:51:42,030
At first, I wondered what I would do if things were awkward.

2545
01:51:42,030 --> 01:51:43,131
But it was fun.

2546
01:51:43,331 --> 01:51:45,501
We became close and comfortable around each other.

2547
01:51:45,501 --> 01:51:48,900
But we couldn't let people know whom we went on a date with.

2548
01:51:49,140 --> 01:51:50,971
It made things more fun.

2549
01:51:51,270 --> 01:51:52,911
We became close,

2550
01:51:53,270 --> 01:51:55,711
but we couldn't show it.

2551
01:51:56,240 --> 01:51:58,551
We can't show it...

2552
01:51:58,551 --> 01:52:01,751
because then it becomes obvious that those two aren't siblings.

2553
01:52:02,251 --> 01:52:03,820
That's why we can't show it.

2554
01:52:05,121 --> 01:52:06,121
Isn't it fun?

2555
01:52:07,751 --> 01:52:08,761
(Cute)

2556
01:52:08,761 --> 01:52:10,390
(In capital letters. C, U, T, E.)

2557
01:52:11,730 --> 01:52:13,661
(My heart got knocked out.)

2558
01:52:15,701 --> 01:52:18,270
(I finally listened to Jae Hyung sing.)

2559
01:52:18,270 --> 01:52:19,331
Really?

2560
01:52:19,331 --> 01:52:22,001
(I heard the speaker rip.)

2561
01:52:22,001 --> 01:52:23,841
(She can't school her face.)

2562
01:52:23,841 --> 01:52:26,041
(Se Seung and Cheol Hyeon take a walk together.)

2563
01:52:26,041 --> 01:52:28,280
- Are you a model? - You are so pretty.

2564
01:52:29,610 --> 01:52:31,280
(You are really pretty.)

2565
01:52:31,280 --> 01:52:33,980
(My dad said, "Find someone like your dad.")

2566
01:52:34,051 --> 01:52:36,451
(Is that Cheol Hyeon?)

2567
01:52:36,551 --> 01:52:37,980
(What did you do today?)

2568
01:52:37,980 --> 01:52:39,421
(I went on a stroll around the neighbourhood.)

2569
01:52:39,421 --> 01:52:41,990
(- With whom? - Cheol Hyeon.)

2570
01:52:41,990 --> 01:52:42,990
(I see.)

2571
01:52:42,990 --> 01:52:44,421
(Just the two of you?)

2572
01:52:44,421 --> 01:52:46,390
(I began following them with my eyes.)

2573
01:52:46,390 --> 01:52:48,030
(I am jealous.)

2574
01:52:48,030 --> 01:52:50,201
(Of course, I am jealous.)

2575
01:52:50,201 --> 01:52:52,230
(It would be funny to explain myself.)

2576
01:52:52,230 --> 01:52:54,201
(He isn't my boyfriend.)

2577
01:52:54,201 --> 01:52:57,740
(I don't think she had fallen for him...)

2578
01:52:58,171 --> 01:53:01,440
(completely.)
