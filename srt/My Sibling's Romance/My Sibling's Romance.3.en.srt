1
00:00:00,016 --> 00:00:04,286
(The participants head to the Siblings' Room.)

2
00:00:04,286 --> 00:00:06,227
(Jung Sub's sibling)

3
00:00:06,227 --> 00:00:08,227
(Lee Jung Sub's sibling, Lee Yun Ha)

4
00:00:08,227 --> 00:00:10,097
(Cho A's sibling)

5
00:00:10,097 --> 00:00:12,227
(Park Cho A's sibling, Park Cheol Hyeon)

6
00:00:12,227 --> 00:00:15,597
(He has a special fantasy.)

7
00:00:15,597 --> 00:00:18,167
(It's one of my "Find My Brother-In-Law" mission.)

8
00:00:18,167 --> 00:00:23,877
(Who will fulfill the Brother-in-law Hunter's dreams?)

9
00:00:23,877 --> 00:00:25,476
(Based on the first impression...)

10
00:00:25,476 --> 00:00:28,176
(It's Yong Woo.)

11
00:00:28,176 --> 00:00:33,887
(Your sister chose Jung Sub.)

12
00:00:34,487 --> 00:00:35,557
- Really? - Yes.

13
00:00:36,887 --> 00:00:38,887
(The siblings are gathered in a bowling alley.)

14
00:00:38,887 --> 00:00:42,197
(I got to spend a lot of time with Se Seung.)

15
00:00:42,197 --> 00:00:45,366
(I couldn't help but view her in a favourable manner.)

16
00:00:46,267 --> 00:00:47,597
(What do you look for in your dating partner?)

17
00:00:47,926 --> 00:00:49,936
(He's curious about me!)

18
00:00:50,137 --> 00:00:53,036
(Jung Sub: Do you like egg dishes? Cho A: I like eggs.)

19
00:00:53,036 --> 00:00:56,806
(To be exact, I have feelings for her.)

20
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:59,976
(The fact that he cooked for us was very touching.)

21
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:01,616
(Glancing)

22
00:01:01,616 --> 00:01:04,217
(Tomorrow is the Cupid Date.)

23
00:01:04,217 --> 00:01:07,717
(You will be informed about the time and the location individually.)

24
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:10,386
(Does the woman that asked me out want me too?)

25
00:01:11,827 --> 00:01:14,857
(Today is the Cupid Date.)

26
00:01:14,857 --> 00:01:16,026
(For the Cupid Date,)

27
00:01:16,026 --> 00:01:17,957
(the date is happening...)

28
00:01:17,957 --> 00:01:18,967
(without you having any idea...)

29
00:01:18,967 --> 00:01:20,327
(about who your date partner is.)

30
00:01:21,297 --> 00:01:25,006
(The Cupid Messages the women wrote on their first day here...)

31
00:01:26,437 --> 00:01:28,207
(were passed to the person they thought was the sister...)

32
00:01:28,207 --> 00:01:29,937
(of the man they wished to date.)

33
00:01:31,107 --> 00:01:36,116
(Through Cupid, or after going through many people,)

34
00:01:37,577 --> 00:01:43,357
(the Messages were delivered to all the male participants.)

35
00:01:44,817 --> 00:01:48,797
(I hope you're the one I want to give this note to.)

36
00:01:49,457 --> 00:01:50,726
(Who is she?)

37
00:01:50,857 --> 00:01:52,097
(I was looking forward...)

38
00:01:52,097 --> 00:01:53,467
(to whom I was going...)

39
00:01:53,467 --> 00:01:55,737
(to meet.)

40
00:01:59,266 --> 00:02:04,177
(The sun rose up in the morning.)

41
00:02:04,606 --> 00:02:07,976
(Rustling)

42
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:17,386
(Jae Hyung wakes up.)

43
00:02:20,356 --> 00:02:22,456
(He starts managing his skin.)

44
00:02:49,016 --> 00:02:50,386
Is he a beauty YouTuber?

45
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:51,927
(MIYEON)

46
00:02:51,927 --> 00:02:53,127
He's almost like a beauty YouTuber.

47
00:02:53,127 --> 00:02:55,157
Why do I find Jae Hyung so funny?

48
00:02:55,597 --> 00:02:56,796
Baked Gong Yoo.

49
00:02:56,997 --> 00:02:58,097
He's handsome.

50
00:02:58,097 --> 00:02:59,196
(Patricia and Jonathan)

51
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:03,536
(Tapping)

52
00:03:12,006 --> 00:03:16,247
(He has a date after his work today.)

53
00:03:36,937 --> 00:03:40,636
(Jae Hyung goes to work.)

54
00:03:41,367 --> 00:03:43,706
Come to think of it, their jobs aren't revealed.

55
00:03:43,706 --> 00:03:45,946
I can't imagine what his job might be.

56
00:03:45,946 --> 00:03:47,377
He's dressed very neatly.

57
00:03:47,576 --> 00:03:49,177
- Then... - An office worker?

58
00:03:49,177 --> 00:03:50,847
He probably is an office worker.

59
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:52,247
I want to know what his job is.

60
00:03:53,286 --> 00:03:56,886
(Jae Hyung goes to work.)

61
00:03:57,317 --> 00:04:00,226
(Wiggling)

62
00:04:01,256 --> 00:04:02,456
Is that Yong Woo?

63
00:04:06,167 --> 00:04:07,966
(Yong Woo wakes up.)

64
00:04:08,227 --> 00:04:09,797
- It is him. - It is him.

65
00:04:09,797 --> 00:04:11,237
- It is him. - He has big feet.

66
00:04:11,237 --> 00:04:12,867
- Even his feet are good-looking. - His feet...

67
00:04:12,867 --> 00:04:14,766
- What? - His feet are as big as mine.

68
00:04:14,836 --> 00:04:15,906
He wakes up coolly.

69
00:04:15,906 --> 00:04:17,437
I knew it was Yong Woo.

70
00:04:18,706 --> 00:04:23,946
(Yong Woo wakes up, or does he?)

71
00:04:23,946 --> 00:04:28,386
(Yong Woo wakes up, or does he?)

72
00:04:33,156 --> 00:04:35,696
(His sister is busy getting ready for work.)

73
00:04:37,696 --> 00:04:39,727
(Rushing in case she is late)

74
00:04:40,367 --> 00:04:42,696
(Ju Yeon goes to work.)

75
00:04:44,297 --> 00:04:46,107
- I'll get going first. - Bye.

76
00:04:46,406 --> 00:04:48,167
- Good luck and see you later. - Okay.

77
00:04:48,977 --> 00:04:51,477
(Yun Ha goes to work.)

78
00:04:53,747 --> 00:04:56,677
(Cho A goes to work.)

79
00:04:57,977 --> 00:05:00,617
(Peeking)

80
00:05:25,547 --> 00:05:28,716
(Se Seung goes out.)

81
00:05:36,956 --> 00:05:39,227
(Cheol Hyeon works out every morning.)

82
00:05:40,227 --> 00:05:42,096
The men must be jobless.

83
00:05:44,797 --> 00:05:46,227
They're not going to work.

84
00:05:56,977 --> 00:05:58,576
- Maybe he does ballet. - My goodness.

85
00:05:58,576 --> 00:05:59,677
- What's this? - Gosh.

86
00:05:59,677 --> 00:06:00,946
- Is he a ballerino? - His body is that of a ballerino.

87
00:06:00,946 --> 00:06:02,216
- A ballerino. - That's right.

88
00:06:07,386 --> 00:06:08,956
- Maybe he does ballet. - My goodness.

89
00:06:08,956 --> 00:06:10,057
- What's this? - Gosh.

90
00:06:10,057 --> 00:06:11,586
- Is he a ballerino? - His body is that of a ballerino.

91
00:06:11,586 --> 00:06:12,956
- A ballerino. - I think...

92
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:14,557
their jobs will be revealed today.

93
00:06:37,917 --> 00:06:42,857
(His push-ups don't end.)

94
00:06:53,526 --> 00:06:56,836
(Cheol Hyeon comes out of the shower after his morning workout.)

95
00:07:06,877 --> 00:07:10,346
(He takes a sunny seat.)

96
00:07:11,146 --> 00:07:13,946
"It makes the memory clearer."

97
00:07:14,216 --> 00:07:16,687
"When you go out for a walk or when you walk a short distance..."

98
00:07:18,057 --> 00:07:20,357
(You read the book out loud.)

99
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:22,557
I read the book out loud...

100
00:07:23,427 --> 00:07:27,667
because it's my very old habit.

101
00:07:28,466 --> 00:07:33,037
When I read it out instead of just reading it with my eyes,

102
00:07:33,167 --> 00:07:36,377
it feels like I am having a conversation.

103
00:07:38,006 --> 00:07:42,117
It's been seven years since I started working out...

104
00:07:42,477 --> 00:07:44,016
and reading in the morning.

105
00:07:44,146 --> 00:07:46,516
They affected me in a lot of good ways.

106
00:07:46,516 --> 00:07:48,886
(Cheol Hyeon's 7 years of habit made him who he is today.)

107
00:07:49,987 --> 00:07:51,586
"You need to sleep a lot."

108
00:07:51,586 --> 00:07:53,656
"What you need now is sleep."

109
00:07:57,096 --> 00:07:59,927
(Cheol Hyeon's morning routine ends.)

110
00:08:03,437 --> 00:08:06,867
(Jung Sub is working from home.)

111
00:08:09,677 --> 00:08:12,146
(Yong Woo who slept in wakes up.)

112
00:08:12,146 --> 00:08:13,406
Hello.

113
00:08:14,877 --> 00:08:16,747
- Have you eaten? - Not yet.

114
00:08:17,617 --> 00:08:19,516
- You're working, right? - Yes.

115
00:08:20,446 --> 00:08:22,257
- All the best. - Thank you.

116
00:08:30,096 --> 00:08:32,866
(Cheol Hyeon)

117
00:08:35,866 --> 00:08:37,567
(Ju Yeon)

118
00:08:40,567 --> 00:08:42,976
(Jung Sub)

119
00:08:45,106 --> 00:08:46,576
(Se Seung)

120
00:08:49,716 --> 00:08:51,317
(Cho A)

121
00:08:53,846 --> 00:08:55,856
(Yun Ha)

122
00:08:58,856 --> 00:09:00,456
(Jae Hyung)

123
00:09:03,726 --> 00:09:05,027
(Yong Woo)

124
00:09:14,537 --> 00:09:18,706
(My Sibling's Romance)

125
00:09:20,446 --> 00:09:25,387
(Episode 3: Like That, We Became Adults)

126
00:09:28,887 --> 00:09:31,057
(Seoripul Park)

127
00:09:32,387 --> 00:09:35,557
(Se Seung is waiting for her date.)

128
00:09:37,027 --> 00:09:38,996
(Who did you have in mind when you wrote the Message?)

129
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:40,267
Jung Sub.

130
00:09:40,897 --> 00:09:42,767
It just felt like the day I moved in.

131
00:09:42,937 --> 00:09:45,196
My heart was beating so fast.

132
00:09:45,637 --> 00:09:46,807
My palms were sweating.

133
00:09:47,407 --> 00:09:50,937
"Who will come? It will be so awkward."

134
00:09:51,277 --> 00:09:52,846
"What should I say?"

135
00:09:52,846 --> 00:09:55,177
"How should I pass the date course to him?"

136
00:09:56,216 --> 00:09:58,417
I was practicing on my own.

137
00:09:58,476 --> 00:10:01,517
(A date simulation)

138
00:10:03,657 --> 00:10:05,057
(Surprised)

139
00:10:07,086 --> 00:10:08,586
It's so steep.

140
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:13,397
(Someone is coming.)

141
00:10:15,027 --> 00:10:18,596
(To whom did Se Seung's Message reach?)

142
00:10:28,446 --> 00:10:31,647
(Se Seung's date is Jung Sub.)

143
00:10:38,216 --> 00:10:40,126
"It actually worked out."

144
00:10:40,726 --> 00:10:41,856
It was funny.

145
00:10:41,986 --> 00:10:43,856
I felt good...

146
00:10:44,057 --> 00:10:47,626
because regardless of whether she chose me or not,

147
00:10:47,927 --> 00:10:50,596
I still got to date her anyway.

148
00:10:50,797 --> 00:10:53,537
I was very grateful.

149
00:10:55,637 --> 00:10:56,907
You were here.

150
00:10:56,907 --> 00:10:58,846
- Have a seat. - Sure.

151
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:04,647
- Thank you. Here. - I...

152
00:11:05,216 --> 00:11:07,116
(They exchange the hand warmers.)

153
00:11:08,446 --> 00:11:10,317
You sure are thoroughly prepared.

154
00:11:11,486 --> 00:11:13,326
- Shall we speak casually? - Sure.

155
00:11:13,326 --> 00:11:14,356
Let's speak casually.

156
00:11:16,326 --> 00:11:18,897
Can I ask you a question?

157
00:11:18,897 --> 00:11:20,297
- What is it? - Well...

158
00:11:21,267 --> 00:11:22,696
Did you know...

159
00:11:22,696 --> 00:11:24,866
Whom I was waiting for?

160
00:11:24,866 --> 00:11:26,037
- It's a secret. - Gosh.

161
00:11:28,336 --> 00:11:29,637
I'll tell you later.

162
00:11:29,777 --> 00:11:31,476
- Why? - It's a long day today.

163
00:11:31,937 --> 00:11:34,547
I don't know if there was a delivery mistake or not,

164
00:11:34,547 --> 00:11:37,017
but thank you for sending me the Message.

165
00:11:39,047 --> 00:11:40,287
A delivery mistake?

166
00:11:40,547 --> 00:11:42,716
Nobody knows.

167
00:11:43,017 --> 00:11:44,887
There should have been a delivery mistake.

168
00:11:45,187 --> 00:11:47,657
At first, I thought...

169
00:11:47,657 --> 00:11:50,956
Ju Yeon was Jung Sub's sibling, so I gave her my Message.

170
00:11:51,696 --> 00:11:53,427
But when I saw Yong Woo from the side,

171
00:11:53,427 --> 00:11:55,767
I thought, "I made a mistake."

172
00:11:57,096 --> 00:12:00,937
But thankfully, Yong Woo was very popular,

173
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,037
so Ju Yeon received a lot of Messages.

174
00:12:04,236 --> 00:12:05,706
- Mine's for you too. - Really?

175
00:12:06,047 --> 00:12:08,647
(Ju Yeon received the Messages from every female participant.)

176
00:12:08,647 --> 00:12:11,047
- Amazing. - If he doesn't choose mine,

177
00:12:11,376 --> 00:12:13,446
there's still a chance of mine reaching him.

178
00:12:13,887 --> 00:12:16,017
There's some possibility.

179
00:12:16,817 --> 00:12:19,057
(Se Seung's Message which was wrongly delivered...)

180
00:12:19,557 --> 00:12:22,356
(was abandoned by Yong Woo.)

181
00:12:22,397 --> 00:12:24,897
("I think our personalities match.")

182
00:12:25,356 --> 00:12:28,767
(It was almost delivered to her sibling.)

183
00:12:29,366 --> 00:12:31,336
(We can read together before choosing.)

184
00:12:32,037 --> 00:12:34,037
(Thankfully, she was able to avoid her sibling.)

185
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:35,437
It's the Message.

186
00:12:35,677 --> 00:12:38,576
(It went around and was delivered to Jung Sub.)

187
00:12:38,736 --> 00:12:40,346
(Meanwhile, in case her brother got upset...)

188
00:12:40,346 --> 00:12:41,907
(if he found out that he received 0 votes,)

189
00:12:42,746 --> 00:12:46,086
(his sister lied to him saying that it was for him.)

190
00:12:46,387 --> 00:12:49,986
I think Se Seung sent the Message properly...

191
00:12:50,086 --> 00:12:52,187
because she wanted to go on a date with me.

192
00:12:52,527 --> 00:12:53,757
It seemed that way.

193
00:12:54,187 --> 00:12:56,856
It was a delivery mistake, but it worked out well.

194
00:12:56,856 --> 00:12:58,726
It was a mistake, but it turned out nicely.

195
00:12:59,996 --> 00:13:01,527
I wrote the wrong address,

196
00:13:01,696 --> 00:13:03,137
but it was delivered to my new house.

197
00:13:03,836 --> 00:13:05,297
- That's amazing. - You're right.

198
00:13:05,297 --> 00:13:07,637
You ordered a parcel to your previous house by mistake,

199
00:13:07,637 --> 00:13:09,277
- but it came to your new house. - That's right.

200
00:13:09,277 --> 00:13:10,407
- That's a bit... - I think that makes it feel...

201
00:13:10,407 --> 00:13:11,537
more like destiny.

202
00:13:11,537 --> 00:13:13,677
- Really? - In the end, they met.

203
00:13:13,677 --> 00:13:14,946
They still ended up together?

204
00:13:14,946 --> 00:13:16,746
- Exactly. - Really?

205
00:13:16,746 --> 00:13:20,147
Does Cupid really exist? How fascinating.

206
00:13:22,356 --> 00:13:23,917
Do you like going to cafés?

207
00:13:24,287 --> 00:13:25,657
I love it.

208
00:13:25,657 --> 00:13:28,157
- You like steaks. - I love steaks.

209
00:13:28,586 --> 00:13:30,027
Do you like going for a drive?

210
00:13:30,027 --> 00:13:31,427
Totally.

211
00:13:31,527 --> 00:13:33,496
I prepared a date customized for you.

212
00:13:33,496 --> 00:13:34,626
- Really? - Yes.

213
00:13:34,626 --> 00:13:36,037
But we're going to go a bit far.

214
00:13:36,037 --> 00:13:38,297
- I can drive. - Yes.

215
00:13:39,466 --> 00:13:42,007
- I said I got my license in May. - Yes.

216
00:13:42,007 --> 00:13:43,706
Can you entrust your life to me?

217
00:13:43,706 --> 00:13:45,037
In that case, I don't think I can.

218
00:13:46,446 --> 00:13:47,606
- I see. - Entrusting my life to you...

219
00:13:47,606 --> 00:13:48,746
on the first date?

220
00:13:49,476 --> 00:13:51,017
It's a bit overbearing.

221
00:13:51,017 --> 00:13:53,147
Isn't that fiery love?

222
00:13:54,787 --> 00:13:55,856
Shall we go?

223
00:13:56,456 --> 00:13:58,456
- Shall we? - Let's go.

224
00:13:59,427 --> 00:14:01,927
- Thank you for the hand warmer. - Thank you very much.

225
00:14:02,596 --> 00:14:04,226
- You only had one, right? - Yes.

226
00:14:04,696 --> 00:14:06,267
I gave you my everything.

227
00:14:06,267 --> 00:14:07,667
- You're right. - I only had one.

228
00:14:07,667 --> 00:14:09,067
- I gave you the only one I had. - I gave you half of what I had.

229
00:14:09,167 --> 00:14:11,096
- You gave me half? - Yes.

230
00:14:12,866 --> 00:14:13,966
I forgive you.

231
00:14:16,836 --> 00:14:18,407
- Let's go. - Let's go.

232
00:14:23,476 --> 00:14:25,476
Did you have a hunch...

233
00:14:25,476 --> 00:14:28,047
about your date partner?

234
00:14:28,047 --> 00:14:30,517
Can I tell you honestly?

235
00:14:30,616 --> 00:14:31,887
- Sure. - I never imagined...

236
00:14:31,887 --> 00:14:35,257
that you would write me the Message.

237
00:14:36,397 --> 00:14:38,427
- I see. - I mean it. But...

238
00:14:38,427 --> 00:14:40,897
I was hoping you would be my date.

239
00:14:41,897 --> 00:14:44,836
Because yesterday was so much fun. So...

240
00:14:45,297 --> 00:14:47,106
- I was very happy to see you. - Really?

241
00:14:47,106 --> 00:14:48,706
- Yes. - I waited without knowing...

242
00:14:48,706 --> 00:14:50,277
who was coming.

243
00:14:50,476 --> 00:14:52,206
- You're right. - I had no idea...

244
00:14:52,206 --> 00:14:54,807
how the Message was delivered.

245
00:14:58,777 --> 00:15:00,446
You received a lot, right?

246
00:15:00,446 --> 00:15:02,047
- Me? The messages? - Yes.

247
00:15:02,417 --> 00:15:03,586
I think you received a lot.

248
00:15:03,586 --> 00:15:05,586
- I didn't. - I think you did.

249
00:15:05,586 --> 00:15:06,757
I didn't.

250
00:15:08,527 --> 00:15:09,826
Then who did you message?

251
00:15:15,297 --> 00:15:16,937
I was curious.

252
00:15:16,937 --> 00:15:18,137
That's fair.

253
00:15:21,637 --> 00:15:23,537
That's why we're going to eat something delicious.

254
00:15:23,537 --> 00:15:24,576
I see.

255
00:15:25,437 --> 00:15:28,106
(Yesterday night, Se Seung messaged Jung Sub.)

256
00:15:29,147 --> 00:15:32,346
(Let's go eat something delicious!)

257
00:15:32,846 --> 00:15:35,647
(He finally found out who sent him the message.)

258
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:41,226
I really can't wait to find out what your job is.

259
00:15:41,956 --> 00:15:43,826
I really have no clue either.

260
00:15:43,826 --> 00:15:45,496
At first, I thought you were a student.

261
00:15:45,626 --> 00:15:47,326
- Me? - Yes, I thought you were a student.

262
00:15:48,527 --> 00:15:50,336
Why did you think I was a student?

263
00:15:51,767 --> 00:15:53,366
- Firstly, you look young. - Because I look young?

264
00:15:54,236 --> 00:15:56,307
And you said you didn't go to work.

265
00:15:57,606 --> 00:15:59,907
Didn't you stay at home yesterday as well?

266
00:15:59,907 --> 00:16:00,946
That's right.

267
00:16:02,547 --> 00:16:05,446
But because we didn't go to work yesterday,

268
00:16:05,446 --> 00:16:08,486
I got to bowl with you,

269
00:16:08,486 --> 00:16:11,687
so I'm very grateful for the time...

270
00:16:11,687 --> 00:16:13,027
that we spent together.

271
00:16:16,356 --> 00:16:17,826
I think that was good.

272
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:23,537
Don't look at each other like that.

273
00:16:23,866 --> 00:16:25,397
- They're killing me. - That was very erotic.

274
00:16:25,397 --> 00:16:26,437
- Just now. - That was erotic?

275
00:16:26,937 --> 00:16:28,137
Their gazes were.

276
00:16:31,976 --> 00:16:34,807
(I think that was good.)

277
00:16:38,116 --> 00:16:40,216
- The weather's so nice today. - The weather's really good today.

278
00:16:40,216 --> 00:16:41,287
Are you a weather fairy?

279
00:16:41,616 --> 00:16:43,687
- Aren't you the weather fairy? - Me?

280
00:16:43,687 --> 00:16:44,687
I'm not.

281
00:16:44,687 --> 00:16:46,326
The weather was amazing.

282
00:16:46,427 --> 00:16:49,626
As we were driving, the sun started to set,

283
00:16:49,626 --> 00:16:51,027
which made me feel good.

284
00:16:51,027 --> 00:16:52,227
My heart fluttered.

285
00:16:55,767 --> 00:16:57,096
What was that?

286
00:16:57,197 --> 00:16:58,936
Can they cut in like that?

287
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:01,267
No.

288
00:17:01,567 --> 00:17:04,207
- They drove the wrong way. - That was terrible.

289
00:17:04,207 --> 00:17:06,277
Attorney Han Moon Chul will be astonished to see that.

290
00:17:06,277 --> 00:17:08,047
(Worried)

291
00:17:08,047 --> 00:17:09,547
"My goodness."

292
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:12,487
"Goodness. Hold on."

293
00:17:12,646 --> 00:17:14,586
"That was completely wrong."

294
00:17:15,856 --> 00:17:17,156
(Amazed)

295
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:19,457
You're good.

296
00:17:21,886 --> 00:17:23,626
It wasn't that funny.

297
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:25,896
He did not remind me of Attorney Han to begin with.

298
00:17:27,396 --> 00:17:29,237
Se Seung is so excited. Look at her face.

299
00:17:30,936 --> 00:17:31,967
He's so good.

300
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:33,707
I think he practices every day.

301
00:17:36,477 --> 00:17:39,076
- He's good? Really? - She's cute.

302
00:17:39,076 --> 00:17:40,646
She's giggling.

303
00:17:41,106 --> 00:17:42,846
She just likes him so much.

304
00:17:42,846 --> 00:17:44,176
Exactly. She's blinded by love.

305
00:17:44,346 --> 00:17:45,987
It was so fun in the car.

306
00:17:45,987 --> 00:17:47,787
We talked a lot...

307
00:17:47,787 --> 00:17:50,356
and we had a similar sense of humour.

308
00:17:50,717 --> 00:17:53,557
She reacted well to what I said, which I was thankful for.

309
00:17:53,557 --> 00:17:55,257
It was really fun. She felt like...

310
00:17:55,926 --> 00:17:57,197
a friend that I met for the first time in a long time.

311
00:17:57,197 --> 00:18:00,767
I think you have great reactions.

312
00:18:01,596 --> 00:18:03,467
You're the best. I mean it.

313
00:18:04,467 --> 00:18:05,537
I'm serious.

314
00:18:05,537 --> 00:18:07,406
- We seem to get along well, right? - Totally.

315
00:18:07,707 --> 00:18:10,676
I think we get along well too. I was quite surprised about that.

316
00:18:13,547 --> 00:18:15,047
Paldang Dam.

317
00:18:16,876 --> 00:18:19,616
(Se Seung and Jung Sub, a café in Paldang)

318
00:18:20,146 --> 00:18:22,686
It got a bit colder than just now.

319
00:18:23,386 --> 00:18:24,616
It's so pretty.

320
00:18:27,156 --> 00:18:28,626
Let's go up there.

321
00:18:29,626 --> 00:18:30,826
Are you afraid of heights?

322
00:18:30,826 --> 00:18:32,197
- Me? No. - Yes.

323
00:18:32,197 --> 00:18:33,326
Really?

324
00:18:34,027 --> 00:18:35,126
(Scared)

325
00:18:35,126 --> 00:18:36,596
- Are you? - Yes.

326
00:18:36,596 --> 00:18:37,836
- You are? - Yes.

327
00:18:38,866 --> 00:18:40,836
- This is kind of scary. - Wait.

328
00:18:40,836 --> 00:18:42,037
- I'm sorry. - Hey.

329
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,576
I'm sorry.

330
00:18:47,477 --> 00:18:48,876
Take pictures of me now.

331
00:18:50,947 --> 00:18:52,686
I will. Hold on.

332
00:18:56,086 --> 00:18:57,787
"Take pictures of me now."

333
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:00,757
Since I came up here with much difficulty.

334
00:19:09,366 --> 00:19:11,166
- Let's order first, Jung Sub. - Yes, let's.

335
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:12,267
Yes, let's do that.

336
00:19:13,807 --> 00:19:15,106
Who do you hit it off with the most?

337
00:19:15,767 --> 00:19:19,346
I think Jae Hyung and I will get along well,

338
00:19:19,646 --> 00:19:22,477
but we didn't have the chance to talk much, which is a pity.

339
00:19:22,846 --> 00:19:24,517
- Yes, you were sick. - It's a pity.

340
00:19:24,517 --> 00:19:25,947
Exactly. He...

341
00:19:26,317 --> 00:19:29,416
I didn't manage to get close to him either.

342
00:19:29,557 --> 00:19:31,057
He does look a bit cold.

343
00:19:31,557 --> 00:19:32,957
- A bit? - Right?

344
00:19:34,227 --> 00:19:35,656
She's keeping up her act.

345
00:19:37,257 --> 00:19:38,896
What's your ideal type, appearance-wise?

346
00:19:39,467 --> 00:19:40,826
Someone with pretty eyes?

347
00:19:42,326 --> 00:19:44,997
Someone who has good reactions and is a smooth talker.

348
00:19:45,366 --> 00:19:47,836
If they listen attentively and say nice things,

349
00:19:47,836 --> 00:19:49,737
I think they're really great people.

350
00:19:51,436 --> 00:19:53,346
I like someone with a kind vibe.

351
00:19:53,346 --> 00:19:55,007
- A kind vibe? - Yes.

352
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:57,076
- Someone with a pretty smile. - A pretty smile?

353
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:00,346
You suddenly can't smile, can you?

354
00:20:00,346 --> 00:20:01,386
No.

355
00:20:07,386 --> 00:20:08,686
Where should I look at to smile?

356
00:20:09,727 --> 00:20:11,326
Why do you like kind people?

357
00:20:12,497 --> 00:20:13,997
I'm not that kind.

358
00:20:14,197 --> 00:20:16,197
I'll tell you on the way to the steak restaurant.

359
00:20:16,197 --> 00:20:17,567
Sure.

360
00:20:17,567 --> 00:20:19,237
- Shall we get going? Cool. - Yes, let's go.

361
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:21,906
So I look kind.

362
00:20:22,336 --> 00:20:23,737
I didn't say I was talking about you.

363
00:20:23,737 --> 00:20:25,436
I didn't say that you looked kind.

364
00:20:25,436 --> 00:20:28,176
But a kind person... I got it.

365
00:20:32,787 --> 00:20:35,586
(Yun Ha and Jae Hyung's Cupid Date)

366
00:20:41,227 --> 00:20:44,096
(Yun Ha is waiting for someone.)

367
00:20:50,267 --> 00:20:53,307
I was hoping that Yong Woo would come.

368
00:20:55,606 --> 00:20:59,707
(She wrote down her feelings thinking about Yong Woo.)

369
00:20:59,707 --> 00:21:01,606
(I think we had a fun atmosphere thanks to you.)

370
00:21:02,007 --> 00:21:04,047
I gave my Message to Ju Yeon...

371
00:21:04,047 --> 00:21:07,586
whom I thought was Yong Woo's sibling.

372
00:21:07,586 --> 00:21:10,317
I wanted...

373
00:21:10,757 --> 00:21:13,326
to get to know Yong Woo.

374
00:21:25,866 --> 00:21:27,007
Is this right?

375
00:21:27,636 --> 00:21:28,807
It's this road.

376
00:21:29,836 --> 00:21:33,646
(Yun Ha's date...)

377
00:21:33,646 --> 00:21:36,076
(is Jae Hyung.)

378
00:21:39,017 --> 00:21:40,217
(Who did you want your first date to be?)

379
00:21:40,217 --> 00:21:41,517
My first date?

380
00:21:41,517 --> 00:21:44,186
I wanted Yun Ha for my first date.

381
00:21:46,356 --> 00:21:48,727
- That's good for him. - Gosh.

382
00:21:48,826 --> 00:21:50,027
I think they will get along well.

383
00:21:50,027 --> 00:21:51,297
I hope he does well.

384
00:21:51,297 --> 00:21:53,467
I think Jae Hyung has a strong side to him.

385
00:21:53,467 --> 00:21:54,826
- On a one-on-one date. - That's right.

386
00:21:54,826 --> 00:21:56,096
He must have another side to him.

387
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:58,737
I wanted to talk with Yun Ha first.

388
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:00,767
Actually, when she first came in,

389
00:22:00,767 --> 00:22:01,807
the way her eyes closed when she smiled...

390
00:22:01,807 --> 00:22:03,606
left a strong impression on me.

391
00:22:03,606 --> 00:22:05,936
I was seated right next to her.

392
00:22:05,936 --> 00:22:07,807
(The first day of moving in)

393
00:22:10,217 --> 00:22:13,747
(Yun Ha's eyes when she smiled left a strong impression on him.)

394
00:22:15,517 --> 00:22:19,057
She kept smiling beside me.

395
00:22:19,826 --> 00:22:22,997
I thought her smile was very charming.

396
00:22:31,967 --> 00:22:33,406
- Hello. - Hello.

397
00:22:41,146 --> 00:22:42,207
(Surprised)

398
00:22:42,207 --> 00:22:43,616
"It's Jae Hyung?"

399
00:22:43,777 --> 00:22:46,346
To be honest, I was really surprised to see him.

400
00:22:47,517 --> 00:22:49,586
Did you go to work today?

401
00:22:49,586 --> 00:22:51,656
- Yes. I'm coming from work. - I see.

402
00:22:52,186 --> 00:22:53,227
You must be tired.

403
00:22:54,787 --> 00:22:56,356
After spotting Yun Ha,

404
00:22:56,727 --> 00:22:57,997
I was happy to see her.

405
00:22:58,356 --> 00:22:59,926
A part of me was also relieved.

406
00:23:00,267 --> 00:23:03,197
Hold on. Then each other's siblings went on dates together.

407
00:23:03,197 --> 00:23:04,297
- With each other. - You're right.

408
00:23:04,297 --> 00:23:05,336
- Jae Hyung. - Jae Hyung...

409
00:23:05,336 --> 00:23:07,166
- and Se Seung. That's it. You know? - You're right.

410
00:23:07,166 --> 00:23:09,307
- You're right. - Gosh. This is interesting.

411
00:23:09,507 --> 00:23:11,436
- Right. - So they may be in-laws on a date?

412
00:23:13,906 --> 00:23:15,106
- Nice to see you. - Nice to see you.

413
00:23:22,717 --> 00:23:24,916
Did you finish figuring out everyone in the house?

414
00:23:25,686 --> 00:23:27,126
- No. Not at all. - Not yet?

415
00:23:27,987 --> 00:23:29,126
You're the hardest one to figure out.

416
00:23:29,356 --> 00:23:30,826
- I'm the hardest one? - I think so.

417
00:23:31,356 --> 00:23:33,027
- But I get that often. - Then...

418
00:23:33,027 --> 00:23:34,126
- I bet. - Yes.

419
00:23:34,896 --> 00:23:38,336
People said it was hard to approach me at first.

420
00:23:38,336 --> 00:23:41,507
You have a cute face.

421
00:23:41,507 --> 00:23:42,767
- Do I look cute? - Yes.

422
00:23:46,477 --> 00:23:48,707
Yes. But there's something about you.

423
00:23:49,176 --> 00:23:51,277
You have your own presence. I think that's probably it.

424
00:23:51,517 --> 00:23:52,886
- Really? - Yes.

425
00:23:55,146 --> 00:23:56,287
(The food they ordered is served.)

426
00:23:56,287 --> 00:23:57,317
- Thank you. - The portion is...

427
00:23:58,616 --> 00:23:59,626
That looks tasty.

428
00:24:00,086 --> 00:24:02,257
- I was hungry. - Yes. I was so hungry too.

429
00:24:06,626 --> 00:24:07,926
I love noodles like this one.

430
00:24:08,326 --> 00:24:09,866
Same here. I love them too.

431
00:24:09,866 --> 00:24:11,936
What are they called? Egg noodles?

432
00:24:11,936 --> 00:24:13,836
- By the way, I love Japanese food. - What?

433
00:24:14,106 --> 00:24:16,037
Me too. What's your favourite dish?

434
00:24:16,406 --> 00:24:18,336
The dish that just came to my mind was okonomiyaki.

435
00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:21,047
Having that with draft beer.

436
00:24:21,576 --> 00:24:22,646
That sounds good.

437
00:24:23,047 --> 00:24:25,547
Let's have Japanese food next time.

438
00:24:26,287 --> 00:24:27,886
With Jae Hyung,

439
00:24:28,247 --> 00:24:31,787
our favourite food, preferences, and personalities...

440
00:24:31,787 --> 00:24:34,656
seemed to overlap a lot.

441
00:24:35,027 --> 00:24:37,697
I was very surprised throughout our conversation.

442
00:24:38,957 --> 00:24:40,926
I want to guess something about you.

443
00:24:41,366 --> 00:24:43,497
You want to guess? What do you want to guess?

444
00:24:44,396 --> 00:24:45,396
Your job.

445
00:24:45,396 --> 00:24:46,406
I see. My job?

446
00:24:46,666 --> 00:24:47,767
I'm so curious about your job.

447
00:24:47,967 --> 00:24:49,237
I can't picture you at work.

448
00:24:49,606 --> 00:24:51,477
- You can't? - You were an idol star, right?

449
00:24:51,777 --> 00:24:52,836
An idol star?

450
00:24:53,906 --> 00:24:55,047
Well, people told me I was crazy.

451
00:24:56,916 --> 00:24:57,947
He's funny.

452
00:24:58,676 --> 00:25:00,247
I wonder what his job is.

453
00:25:01,287 --> 00:25:02,386
Well, people told me I was crazy.

454
00:25:04,616 --> 00:25:05,717
Hey, what was that?

455
00:25:05,957 --> 00:25:08,527
I can tell that you can be a bit unpredictable.

456
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,197
But I have a crazy side too.

457
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:12,027
- I see. - Yes. Even...

458
00:25:13,227 --> 00:25:14,596
We're both crazy, but in a different way.

459
00:25:14,866 --> 00:25:16,027
Why do you say that?

460
00:25:16,336 --> 00:25:17,737
We might be crazy in the same way.

461
00:25:17,737 --> 00:25:19,166
I can sense that we're alike.

462
00:25:19,166 --> 00:25:20,166
- Really? - Yes.

463
00:25:20,166 --> 00:25:21,207
Are you sure?

464
00:25:23,176 --> 00:25:25,307
We clicked well.

465
00:25:25,406 --> 00:25:28,207
I thought she and I had a similar sense of humour.

466
00:25:28,376 --> 00:25:31,547
It will be more fun once our jobs are revealed.

467
00:25:32,247 --> 00:25:34,487
Then make one guess. Guess what my job might be.

468
00:25:34,817 --> 00:25:36,287
I get the feeling...

469
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:41,487
that you might be good at calculations.

470
00:25:41,487 --> 00:25:43,326
- Calculations? - Like math and science.

471
00:25:43,326 --> 00:25:44,356
Math and science?

472
00:25:44,856 --> 00:25:46,797
Yes, from your behaviours in the house.

473
00:25:47,697 --> 00:25:48,697
You're a planner.

474
00:25:48,826 --> 00:25:50,836
What's that look on your face? You're trying to look cool.

475
00:25:52,697 --> 00:25:54,707
Today, I'm getting a feeling you work...

476
00:25:55,166 --> 00:25:56,207
in the financial sector.

477
00:25:56,406 --> 00:25:57,436
In the financial sector?

478
00:25:58,406 --> 00:25:59,537
I do like money.

479
00:26:00,307 --> 00:26:01,876
I guess he doesn't work in that sector.

480
00:26:01,876 --> 00:26:03,616
- Maybe, she's completely off. - I can't even guess.

481
00:26:03,616 --> 00:26:05,576
I guess he has a job that requires emotional intelligence.

482
00:26:05,576 --> 00:26:06,616
Right.

483
00:26:06,787 --> 00:26:10,356
I bet there is one thing Jae Hyung is really good at.

484
00:26:10,686 --> 00:26:11,957
Like what? Make a guess.

485
00:26:11,957 --> 00:26:15,186
Maybe, he has to give his 100 percent with this career.

486
00:26:15,356 --> 00:26:16,856
- I see. Like a professional job. - Something like that.

487
00:26:17,057 --> 00:26:18,926
So you think he's a specialist of some kind, right?

488
00:26:18,926 --> 00:26:19,926
Right.

489
00:26:21,166 --> 00:26:22,267
I do like money.

490
00:26:23,997 --> 00:26:25,237
Then that makes more sense.

491
00:26:25,537 --> 00:26:27,106
You have many unexpected sides.

492
00:26:27,106 --> 00:26:28,166
- You think so? - Yes.

493
00:26:29,366 --> 00:26:30,376
This is fun.

494
00:26:31,636 --> 00:26:33,977
There are so many things we're not supposed to ask.

495
00:26:34,207 --> 00:26:37,017
It does keep making me think.

496
00:26:37,146 --> 00:26:38,376
But isn't this more fun?

497
00:26:38,616 --> 00:26:41,886
I change my mind about who is whose sibling...

498
00:26:41,886 --> 00:26:43,186
every day.

499
00:26:43,317 --> 00:26:44,416
- Really? - Yes.

500
00:26:44,616 --> 00:26:47,287
I think Cheol Hyeon is Yun Ha's brother.

501
00:26:49,527 --> 00:26:54,267
In my opinion, they sort of have similar auras.

502
00:26:54,727 --> 00:26:57,666
It's like...

503
00:26:58,237 --> 00:27:00,537
It's the way they look.

504
00:27:00,906 --> 00:27:02,067
How should I explain this?

505
00:27:02,267 --> 00:27:03,277
- Gosh. - What?

506
00:27:04,007 --> 00:27:06,846
- I guess everyone gets this wrong. - Yes, this is understandable.

507
00:27:06,846 --> 00:27:09,846
The more you think about it, the more confused you get.

508
00:27:09,846 --> 00:27:12,277
- Right. - You get more confused in the head.

509
00:27:12,277 --> 00:27:14,317
But he had a bad hunch from the beginning.

510
00:27:14,317 --> 00:27:15,447
- Right. - Yes.

511
00:27:15,817 --> 00:27:16,987
After moving into this house,

512
00:27:16,987 --> 00:27:18,757
is there someone you want to get to know more?

513
00:27:19,586 --> 00:27:20,757
My sister.

514
00:27:22,126 --> 00:27:23,396
Your sister?

515
00:27:25,126 --> 00:27:27,166
Hold on. I didn't make any mistakes.

516
00:27:27,567 --> 00:27:28,626
Right?

517
00:27:29,166 --> 00:27:33,136
Seriously. I mean, that answer was so you.

518
00:27:33,436 --> 00:27:34,936
I thought it was a sweet answer.

519
00:27:38,836 --> 00:27:41,707
After the first date, I became comfortable around Yun Ha.

520
00:27:42,207 --> 00:27:44,547
After talking to her, I learned that she was very down-to-earth.

521
00:27:44,547 --> 00:27:46,846
She was an easy type to get to know.

522
00:27:47,017 --> 00:27:49,487
We only met recently.

523
00:27:49,487 --> 00:27:51,086
So we talked a lot.

524
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,817
He's quite witty.

525
00:27:52,957 --> 00:27:55,227
I think our personalities are quite similar too.

526
00:27:55,557 --> 00:27:57,757
I had a fun time with him.

527
00:27:58,957 --> 00:28:01,227
(Their younger siblings are also having a fun time.)

528
00:28:01,626 --> 00:28:04,866
By the way, girls usually fall for bad guys.

529
00:28:05,737 --> 00:28:08,936
I'm really not drawn to bad guys.

530
00:28:09,336 --> 00:28:12,436
Let's say I'm interested in someone. But if I feel that he's a bad guy,

531
00:28:12,676 --> 00:28:14,646
then I lose all of my interest right away.

532
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:19,017
In my opinion, bad guys are equivalent...

533
00:28:19,886 --> 00:28:21,386
to tteokbokki.

534
00:28:23,086 --> 00:28:25,616
- It's not healthy? - It's really not healthy.

535
00:28:26,317 --> 00:28:28,057
A lot of sugar goes into that.

536
00:28:28,057 --> 00:28:29,826
I don't like tteokbokki.

537
00:28:29,957 --> 00:28:31,096
I see.

538
00:28:31,356 --> 00:28:32,697
- That's it. - Is that so?

539
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:34,497
What if I make tteokbokki for you later, and you say...

540
00:28:35,626 --> 00:28:37,336
- "Gosh, this is so tasty." - "This is so tasty."

541
00:28:38,037 --> 00:28:39,906
- "Did you go grocery shopping?" - "Did you go grocery shopping?"

542
00:28:41,936 --> 00:28:43,906
- What is that? - What?

543
00:28:43,906 --> 00:28:45,336
- They're already dating. - They're a good match.

544
00:28:45,336 --> 00:28:46,807
- Just get married! - They're so good together.

545
00:28:46,807 --> 00:28:48,406
- How is it possible? They just met. - This is great.

546
00:28:48,576 --> 00:28:50,777
- They... - Gosh, they're so good together.

547
00:28:50,947 --> 00:28:52,146
For some reason, they're starting...

548
00:28:52,146 --> 00:28:53,317
- to look similar too. - Right.

549
00:28:53,447 --> 00:28:55,247
- It's like decalcomania. - Right?

550
00:28:56,346 --> 00:28:57,386
Like this.

551
00:28:58,186 --> 00:28:59,186
Seriously.

552
00:28:59,186 --> 00:29:00,287
(Decalcomania)

553
00:29:00,557 --> 00:29:01,856
What if you say that?

554
00:29:03,497 --> 00:29:06,227
- Let's go inside. - Let's go inside.

555
00:29:06,497 --> 00:29:07,527
This place is lovely.

556
00:29:07,826 --> 00:29:09,096
- This place is great. - It's great.

557
00:29:09,096 --> 00:29:10,297
- Isn't this place so pretty? - Yes.

558
00:29:11,797 --> 00:29:12,797
Gosh.

559
00:29:14,166 --> 00:29:15,436
Hold on. Give me that.

560
00:29:16,537 --> 00:29:18,336
- Can you pour some water for me? - I'll do it.

561
00:29:22,507 --> 00:29:23,616
- Okay. - Thank you.

562
00:29:23,616 --> 00:29:24,616
Sure.

563
00:29:25,777 --> 00:29:26,886
Here's your food.

564
00:29:27,547 --> 00:29:28,646
Thank you.

565
00:29:32,017 --> 00:29:33,356
Thank you.

566
00:29:36,356 --> 00:29:37,596
Gosh, this looks really tasty.

567
00:29:40,866 --> 00:29:41,926
Isn't it good?

568
00:29:44,336 --> 00:29:45,436
We should come here again tomorrow.

569
00:29:46,567 --> 00:29:47,636
It's so good.

570
00:29:49,307 --> 00:29:50,336
Cheers.

571
00:29:55,247 --> 00:29:56,676
How often do you drink wine?

572
00:29:56,676 --> 00:29:58,676
- Do you drink wine often? - As for wine,

573
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:01,586
I drink it on special occasions.

574
00:30:05,416 --> 00:30:07,086
I'm looking forward to what's to come.

575
00:30:07,957 --> 00:30:10,326
- To be honest, I'm really curious. - About me?

576
00:30:10,497 --> 00:30:13,426
After getting to know everyone's age and careers...

577
00:30:13,896 --> 00:30:14,997
- How that would affect us? - How that would affect us.

578
00:30:14,997 --> 00:30:16,096
I'm curious about that.

579
00:30:16,326 --> 00:30:18,436
People call that conditional probability.

580
00:30:20,207 --> 00:30:22,336
The probability with prior knowledge...

581
00:30:22,336 --> 00:30:24,007
and the probability without any prior knowledge...

582
00:30:24,007 --> 00:30:25,037
are completely different.

583
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:27,346
And both of us don't know anything about each other.

584
00:30:28,047 --> 00:30:29,307
But we'll find out soon.

585
00:30:29,807 --> 00:30:31,017
But that won't be the only thing.

586
00:30:31,777 --> 00:30:34,017
Well, a lot of things can happen. Anyway...

587
00:30:34,017 --> 00:30:35,116
There are many variables?

588
00:30:35,616 --> 00:30:37,987
There are three more variables.

589
00:30:39,686 --> 00:30:40,727
Cheers.

590
00:30:48,467 --> 00:30:50,136
- Let's come back again. - What?

591
00:30:50,136 --> 00:30:51,136
The food here is good.

592
00:30:51,797 --> 00:30:55,136
(Staring)

593
00:30:59,136 --> 00:31:00,176
What?

594
00:31:01,047 --> 00:31:02,146
- Nothing. - I'm feeling shy.

595
00:31:07,646 --> 00:31:09,817
Initially, I didn't think...

596
00:31:09,817 --> 00:31:11,957
I paid a lot of attention to people's looks.

597
00:31:12,057 --> 00:31:13,987
But he's my ideal type.

598
00:31:15,156 --> 00:31:16,156
So I like it.

599
00:31:16,997 --> 00:31:19,727
I like looking at his face.

600
00:31:21,626 --> 00:31:22,997
I can't stop just looking at him like this.

601
00:31:24,237 --> 00:31:26,297
"I really like guys similar to Jung Sub."

602
00:31:26,297 --> 00:31:27,366
While thinking that.

603
00:31:27,836 --> 00:31:29,967
- She really likes him. - Goodness.

604
00:31:30,106 --> 00:31:31,376
She must really like him.

605
00:31:31,376 --> 00:31:32,436
- That's so obvious. - What?

606
00:31:32,436 --> 00:31:33,507
- But... - That's...

607
00:31:33,507 --> 00:31:34,576
- love. - I want to be on the show too.

608
00:31:34,576 --> 00:31:36,916
When women are this straightforward about their feelings,

609
00:31:38,017 --> 00:31:40,586
wouldn't men fall for such women instantly?

610
00:31:40,586 --> 00:31:42,886
Here's a thing. When their friends ask about such women,

611
00:31:42,886 --> 00:31:45,156
men would say they're not interested in such women.

612
00:31:45,156 --> 00:31:46,317
But when it actually happens, they would fall for such women.

613
00:31:46,317 --> 00:31:47,326
Exactly.

614
00:31:47,326 --> 00:31:49,356
To other people, they would say they wouldn't be interested.

615
00:31:49,356 --> 00:31:50,896
- They would deny it. - Right. "That would be too much."

616
00:31:50,896 --> 00:31:52,596
- Right. When it actually happens... - "I wouldn't be interested."

617
00:31:53,297 --> 00:31:55,197
- You would totally fall for her? - You would even develop feelings.

618
00:31:55,567 --> 00:31:57,096
Seriously. Not a lot of women are like her.

619
00:31:57,396 --> 00:31:58,697
Your gaze is similar to Se Seung's.

620
00:31:58,936 --> 00:32:00,366
- Gosh. - What was that?

621
00:32:00,666 --> 00:32:01,737
- Hey. - I think you're in love.

622
00:32:01,737 --> 00:32:03,267
- She's in love with him. - Get a grip.

623
00:32:03,477 --> 00:32:04,606
Get a grip.

624
00:32:04,707 --> 00:32:05,807
- This is nice. - "Get a grip."

625
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:08,076
It would be nice to walk for a bit.

626
00:32:08,076 --> 00:32:09,777
- To digest our food? - Yes.

627
00:32:09,777 --> 00:32:12,017
- How about the Han River? - Sounds good.

628
00:32:12,977 --> 00:32:15,547
I love looking at Mount Nam like this.

629
00:32:15,886 --> 00:32:18,116
It totally brings out the sentimental side of me.

630
00:32:18,416 --> 00:32:19,757
Whether it's day or night...

631
00:32:19,757 --> 00:32:21,086
Actually, it's stronger during the day.

632
00:32:21,926 --> 00:32:23,426
I think the world is a beautiful place...

633
00:32:23,426 --> 00:32:24,926
thanks to sentimental people.

634
00:32:26,767 --> 00:32:28,467
The world can function thanks to rational people?

635
00:32:29,866 --> 00:32:32,136
- Aren't you cold? - What's your nickname?

636
00:32:32,737 --> 00:32:34,237
My nickname?

637
00:32:35,106 --> 00:32:36,307
- What was that? - They're close to the house.

638
00:32:36,307 --> 00:32:37,436
- What was that? - What? That startled me. Come on.

639
00:32:37,436 --> 00:32:39,207
- I thought he held her hand. - Jung Sub...

640
00:32:39,406 --> 00:32:40,977
Gosh. Calm down.

641
00:32:40,977 --> 00:32:42,047
My nickname?

642
00:32:43,307 --> 00:32:44,676
- I don't have one. Just Sub. - Your nickname.

643
00:32:45,146 --> 00:32:46,146
Sub.

644
00:32:46,886 --> 00:32:47,916
Like Sub Sub.

645
00:32:47,916 --> 00:32:49,947
No, just Sub.

646
00:32:50,717 --> 00:32:51,717
Sub.

647
00:32:53,217 --> 00:32:54,227
Seung.

648
00:33:01,297 --> 00:33:05,366
(Ju Yeon and Cheol Hyeon's Cupid Date)

649
00:33:23,817 --> 00:33:27,326
(The date Ju Yeon is waiting for is...)

650
00:33:29,186 --> 00:33:31,626
(Ju Yeon gave the note to Cho A,)

651
00:33:31,626 --> 00:33:34,997
(hoping it would reach Cheol Hyeon.)

652
00:33:36,366 --> 00:33:39,336
(Ju Yeon's note was delivered to Cho A...)

653
00:33:40,166 --> 00:33:42,537
(and safely reached Cheol Hyeon.)

654
00:33:45,876 --> 00:33:47,247
I knew I would see Cheol Hyeon.

655
00:33:47,477 --> 00:33:49,747
I was 95 percent certain.

656
00:33:59,086 --> 00:34:00,987
- Hello. - Hello.

657
00:34:01,356 --> 00:34:02,487
When did you get here?

658
00:34:02,726 --> 00:34:04,157
About ten minutes ago?

659
00:34:04,157 --> 00:34:05,496
- Has it been 10 minutes? - It's been 10 minutes?

660
00:34:06,197 --> 00:34:08,927
I was somewhat certain that I would see...

661
00:34:08,927 --> 00:34:10,867
Ju Yeon on the date.

662
00:34:11,867 --> 00:34:13,737
Cheol Hyeon, you're a vegan.

663
00:34:13,907 --> 00:34:16,266
- Yes. You remembered. - This restaurant...

664
00:34:16,266 --> 00:34:17,306
- Of course. - Yes.

665
00:34:17,306 --> 00:34:19,206
I saw a lot of vegan dishes on the menu.

666
00:34:19,976 --> 00:34:22,407
Ju Yeon is the one I'm the most interested in.

667
00:34:22,947 --> 00:34:27,186
I sensed that Ju Yeon was trying to take care of me.

668
00:34:27,286 --> 00:34:28,916
So I wanted to go on a date with her...

669
00:34:29,117 --> 00:34:30,556
and talk to her.

670
00:34:31,157 --> 00:34:33,556
- Let's drink to loosen up. - Yes. Cheers.

671
00:34:38,197 --> 00:34:40,197
That looks like a date zoomers would go on.

672
00:34:40,197 --> 00:34:41,266
Right.

673
00:34:41,266 --> 00:34:42,266
- Why do you say that? - Is that so?

674
00:34:42,266 --> 00:34:44,137
- What made you say that? - I'm curious about why.

675
00:34:44,137 --> 00:34:45,896
I'm seeing a lot of silver at the restaurant.

676
00:34:45,896 --> 00:34:48,467
- What? - I'm seeing a lot of silver.

677
00:34:48,467 --> 00:34:50,677
- I see. The interior design? - The interior design?

678
00:34:51,077 --> 00:34:52,637
- No? - I should write that down.

679
00:34:52,637 --> 00:34:54,806
- Stainless interior design. - Write it.

680
00:34:54,806 --> 00:34:57,617
You're clinging on to the word, "zoomer."

681
00:35:01,117 --> 00:35:02,947
- Come on. Why did you say that? - What?

682
00:35:03,987 --> 00:35:06,317
- Don't talk over me. Seriously. - What did you do that?

683
00:35:06,487 --> 00:35:08,157
"Don't cling on to the word, 'zoomer.'"

684
00:35:09,856 --> 00:35:12,257
It will be better with more ice cubes.

685
00:35:12,257 --> 00:35:13,797
Isn't it too strong?

686
00:35:13,927 --> 00:35:15,797
- I like it. - Is it okay for you?

687
00:35:15,797 --> 00:35:17,266
- I can drink it little by little. - Yes.

688
00:35:17,536 --> 00:35:19,567
When we were drinking highballs yesterday,

689
00:35:19,567 --> 00:35:21,206
- I noticed you got tipsy quickly. - Right.

690
00:35:21,706 --> 00:35:23,706
- The highballs were really good. - Were they good?

691
00:35:23,706 --> 00:35:24,836
You're good at mixing drinks.

692
00:35:25,036 --> 00:35:28,347
- I'll make another one next time. - Sounds good.

693
00:35:29,646 --> 00:35:31,246
- This is beautiful. - It looks tasty. Right.

694
00:35:31,976 --> 00:35:33,646
- Should we take a picture? - Sounds good.

695
00:35:43,056 --> 00:35:44,456
(Startled)

696
00:35:54,637 --> 00:35:56,306
- Boyfriends take photos like that. - That's...

697
00:35:56,306 --> 00:35:57,677
- I have so much to learn from him. - Oh, my.

698
00:35:57,677 --> 00:35:58,936
They are quite calm...

699
00:35:58,936 --> 00:35:59,976
- which I didn't expect. - Right.

700
00:36:01,347 --> 00:36:03,206
What are you like?

701
00:36:03,206 --> 00:36:04,876
- When you're in relationships, - Yes.

702
00:36:05,177 --> 00:36:08,047
are you the type to celebrate special anniversaries?

703
00:36:08,047 --> 00:36:10,146
- Totally. I love gifting people. - In person?

704
00:36:10,387 --> 00:36:13,186
I guess you get a lot of joy as a giver.

705
00:36:13,186 --> 00:36:14,186
- Yes. - I see.

706
00:36:14,186 --> 00:36:16,427
When I think about...

707
00:36:16,427 --> 00:36:19,956
how happy the receiver would be from my present,

708
00:36:19,956 --> 00:36:21,527
it makes me so happy.

709
00:36:23,836 --> 00:36:25,967
I noticed that she liked the act of giving.

710
00:36:26,197 --> 00:36:28,737
She said she was happy when she saw her presents...

711
00:36:28,737 --> 00:36:29,836
making other people happy.

712
00:36:30,036 --> 00:36:33,476
I felt that she was the type of person...

713
00:36:33,476 --> 00:36:36,146
I had been wanting to date.

714
00:36:36,476 --> 00:36:39,447
I thought that Cheol Hyeon was quite unique.

715
00:36:39,746 --> 00:36:41,117
And I was right.

716
00:36:42,547 --> 00:36:44,987
He asked me a lot of questions about me.

717
00:36:45,157 --> 00:36:46,556
Through our conversation,

718
00:36:46,556 --> 00:36:48,257
I got to learn a lot about Cheol Hyeon.

719
00:36:48,527 --> 00:36:51,527
I'm interested in Cheol Hyeon the most.

720
00:36:54,067 --> 00:36:56,427
(That night)

721
00:36:57,297 --> 00:37:00,067
(Not to leak their dates, they come home separately.)

722
00:37:05,436 --> 00:37:07,177
I'm home.

723
00:37:08,646 --> 00:37:10,876
- Hello. - Jae Hyung.

724
00:37:10,876 --> 00:37:13,347
- Yes. - It's been a while.

725
00:37:13,547 --> 00:37:14,947
Did you have fun?

726
00:37:14,947 --> 00:37:16,547
I'm coming from work.

727
00:37:16,547 --> 00:37:17,657
Exactly.

728
00:37:23,697 --> 00:37:26,356
(Cheol Hyeon comes back home.)

729
00:37:28,067 --> 00:37:30,027
(Se Seung comes back home.)

730
00:37:30,637 --> 00:37:32,536
(Yun Ha comes back home.)

731
00:37:35,206 --> 00:37:36,367
Yes.

732
00:37:36,907 --> 00:37:38,277
Would you like some tea, Yun Ha?

733
00:37:38,277 --> 00:37:39,706
- Sure. - Orange or lemon?

734
00:37:41,476 --> 00:37:42,947
How about orange?

735
00:37:43,976 --> 00:37:45,016
Sure.

736
00:37:49,586 --> 00:37:51,016
You're not wearing them, are you?

737
00:37:51,757 --> 00:37:52,887
Is that so?

738
00:37:53,117 --> 00:37:56,027
Now that he went on a date, I clearly saw that Jae Hyung...

739
00:37:56,027 --> 00:37:57,356
felt comfortable in the house.

740
00:37:57,356 --> 00:37:59,027
He talked to her first.

741
00:37:59,726 --> 00:38:02,126
He asked her to have tea with her.

742
00:38:02,567 --> 00:38:05,666
He was acting like himself. And he seemed at ease.

743
00:38:06,737 --> 00:38:09,007
I think that's because he's gotten close to someone.

744
00:38:09,266 --> 00:38:12,177
I'm not sure if that's Ju Yeon or Yun Ha.

745
00:38:13,177 --> 00:38:14,547
- You should wait a bit. - Thank you.

746
00:38:14,547 --> 00:38:15,706
- So the tea gets brewed. - Okay.

747
00:38:15,706 --> 00:38:17,447
- It's good once it gets brewed. - This is pretty.

748
00:38:17,447 --> 00:38:19,277
Yes. It's really good.

749
00:38:19,277 --> 00:38:20,487
It's so good.

750
00:38:20,487 --> 00:38:24,157
(Cho A and Yong Woo's Cupid Date)

751
00:38:30,856 --> 00:38:33,697
(It's 10:30pm now.)

752
00:38:35,067 --> 00:38:39,197
(The date took place after Cho A got off work late at night.)

753
00:38:49,347 --> 00:38:52,577
(The date Cho A is waiting for is...)

754
00:38:54,016 --> 00:38:56,447
(Who was the intended recipient of your note?)

755
00:38:57,786 --> 00:39:00,657
It was Jung Sub.

756
00:39:01,027 --> 00:39:04,827
He seemed like a calm, serious guy.

757
00:39:04,827 --> 00:39:05,856
(She wrote the note for Jung Sub.)

758
00:39:05,856 --> 00:39:07,297
(It's quite chilly. Would you like to have a warm cup of tea?)

759
00:39:07,297 --> 00:39:10,266
(Because she picked the wrong Cupid,)

760
00:39:11,697 --> 00:39:15,067
(it was delivered to Yong Woo, Ju Yeon's older brother.)

761
00:39:18,706 --> 00:39:21,947
(He's on his way to meet the writer of the note.)

762
00:39:21,947 --> 00:39:23,277
You will soon arrive at your destination.

763
00:39:42,226 --> 00:39:44,297
- Hello. - Hello.

764
00:39:45,467 --> 00:39:48,467
- Should I sit over there? - Yes, you can sit there.

765
00:39:49,407 --> 00:39:50,536
I hope you didn't wait for long.

766
00:39:52,876 --> 00:39:54,047
I was happy to see him.

767
00:39:54,646 --> 00:39:56,306
Actually, I was craving...

768
00:39:56,306 --> 00:39:58,916
a cool glass of beer after work around that time.

769
00:39:59,246 --> 00:40:02,646
Meeting with a guy I was happy to see...

770
00:40:02,646 --> 00:40:03,887
made the occasion better.

771
00:40:04,556 --> 00:40:09,086
I barely got to talk to her. We didn't exchange words at all.

772
00:40:09,086 --> 00:40:12,396
I was curious about what kind of person she was.

773
00:40:12,396 --> 00:40:13,996
I was happy that...

774
00:40:13,996 --> 00:40:16,327
I got a chance to talk to Cho A.

775
00:40:16,597 --> 00:40:18,067
Gosh. I have so much support...

776
00:40:18,067 --> 00:40:19,567
- for this couple. - Here's Yong Woo.

777
00:40:19,567 --> 00:40:20,766
- I hope things work out with them. - This is...

778
00:40:20,766 --> 00:40:21,936
- I hope they get married. - a date of adults.

779
00:40:21,936 --> 00:40:23,166
- Right. - You're right. Yes.

780
00:40:23,166 --> 00:40:24,637
In the Siblings' Room, Yong Woo said...

781
00:40:24,637 --> 00:40:26,177
his ideal type was Cho A.

782
00:40:26,177 --> 00:40:27,577
He said she reminded him of Han Go Eun.

783
00:40:27,577 --> 00:40:28,907
- Right. - Yes. He did.

784
00:40:28,907 --> 00:40:30,547
Get married. I'll give you a huge cash gift.

785
00:40:33,217 --> 00:40:36,146
- Enjoy your food. Yes. - Let's eat something tasty.

786
00:40:36,146 --> 00:40:37,887
I haven't had dinner yet either.

787
00:40:38,887 --> 00:40:40,217
I'm going to have two bowls of food.

788
00:40:40,217 --> 00:40:41,757
Only two bowls?

789
00:40:43,427 --> 00:40:45,226
I skipped dinner too.

790
00:40:45,226 --> 00:40:47,027
- Really? Yes. - We both skipped dinner.

791
00:40:47,157 --> 00:40:49,597
We must eat more than two bowls of food here.

792
00:40:49,896 --> 00:40:51,436
- I'm confident I can do it. - You are?

793
00:40:51,436 --> 00:40:52,637
- Yes. - Great.

794
00:40:53,336 --> 00:40:55,336
I think we should order the whole column of dishes.

795
00:40:57,536 --> 00:40:58,637
I'll eat them with you.

796
00:40:58,907 --> 00:41:00,376
Gosh. What should I eat?

797
00:41:00,706 --> 00:41:02,706
Should we get the sushi and the pot rice?

798
00:41:02,706 --> 00:41:04,547
- Sounds good. I want some rice. - The seasonal pot rice.

799
00:41:04,547 --> 00:41:06,677
Right. What kind of drink would you like?

800
00:41:06,916 --> 00:41:10,186
- A glass of beer. Yes. - A glass of beer? I see.

801
00:41:10,186 --> 00:41:11,617
- Excuse me. - Okay.

802
00:41:12,556 --> 00:41:13,887
Thank you.

803
00:41:13,887 --> 00:41:15,887
- I will bring you the ceviche. - Okay.

804
00:41:18,797 --> 00:41:21,427
- Cheers to our hard work. - Yes. Let's enjoy the cool drink.

805
00:41:28,206 --> 00:41:30,106
(Their food is served.)

806
00:41:30,567 --> 00:41:32,306
- I see. This is ceviche. - Yes.

807
00:41:32,777 --> 00:41:34,246
- Thank you. - Thank you.

808
00:41:34,476 --> 00:41:37,047
- The flakes look good. - It looks good. I'm hungry.

809
00:41:37,277 --> 00:41:39,617
I think we're supposed to wrap it with the cilantro.

810
00:41:42,186 --> 00:41:43,246
(Amazed)

811
00:41:44,786 --> 00:41:45,817
- Gosh. - Yes.

812
00:41:46,356 --> 00:41:48,126
We picked the best dish to pair with the beer.

813
00:41:48,126 --> 00:41:49,487
- Exactly. - Right?

814
00:41:49,726 --> 00:41:51,427
Gosh, this is really good.

815
00:41:51,657 --> 00:41:54,166
- To tell you the truth, - Yes.

816
00:41:54,166 --> 00:41:56,396
I had dry-aged sashimi for the first time a while ago.

817
00:41:57,396 --> 00:41:59,137
I think I finished the whole plate...

818
00:41:59,137 --> 00:42:00,737
all by myself in one sitting.

819
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:03,766
- It was really good. - It was?

820
00:42:03,766 --> 00:42:06,306
I'm curious about it. Introduce me to that restaurant.

821
00:42:07,606 --> 00:42:08,746
Actually,

822
00:42:10,246 --> 00:42:12,677
I was wondering whom I would meet here.

823
00:42:12,677 --> 00:42:14,086
- Is that so? - Yes. When I saw your back...

824
00:42:14,086 --> 00:42:15,686
as I walked in, I knew it was you.

825
00:42:15,817 --> 00:42:17,146
- Really? - Yes.

826
00:42:17,416 --> 00:42:19,786
Did you expect to see me here?

827
00:42:21,186 --> 00:42:22,686
- Somewhat. - Somewhat?

828
00:42:22,686 --> 00:42:24,297
- Somewhat. - Somewhat.

829
00:42:24,297 --> 00:42:25,896
So you weren't 100 percent sure?

830
00:42:25,896 --> 00:42:27,867
Yes. To be honest, I wasn't 100 percent sure.

831
00:42:27,867 --> 00:42:30,027
- I didn't have any clear basis. - Okay.

832
00:42:30,197 --> 00:42:31,896
I just wanted...

833
00:42:32,737 --> 00:42:34,436
to talk to you.

834
00:42:34,867 --> 00:42:38,976
We barely got to talk on the first day we met.

835
00:42:39,737 --> 00:42:43,407
I saw your face when you came home yesterday.

836
00:42:43,407 --> 00:42:45,817
- Right. - I got the feeling that you had...

837
00:42:45,817 --> 00:42:48,317
- an exhausting Monday. - Did I seem that exhausted?

838
00:42:48,547 --> 00:42:49,717
You looked...

839
00:42:49,717 --> 00:42:51,186
(Last night)

840
00:42:51,387 --> 00:42:53,117
(Well done today.)

841
00:42:53,456 --> 00:42:55,927
(He saw how exhausted she was when she returned home.)

842
00:42:57,126 --> 00:42:59,856
You came back home, utterly exhausted.

843
00:42:59,856 --> 00:43:02,067
- Yes. I had a tough day yesterday. - So...

844
00:43:02,067 --> 00:43:04,967
I mean, I wanted to talk to you for a bit.

845
00:43:05,036 --> 00:43:06,666
But when you went to your room,

846
00:43:06,666 --> 00:43:08,206
I saw how tired you looked.

847
00:43:08,336 --> 00:43:10,806
- So I couldn't ask you to stay. - Why not? You should have.

848
00:43:10,806 --> 00:43:11,806
You should have talked to me.

849
00:43:11,806 --> 00:43:13,206
I like it when people talk to me.

850
00:43:13,206 --> 00:43:14,507
- Really? - Yes.

851
00:43:16,547 --> 00:43:19,646
- Because he's interested in her, - I think that's why.

852
00:43:19,746 --> 00:43:22,317
he could tell she was tired when she came home yesterday.

853
00:43:22,317 --> 00:43:23,786
But say that he wasn't interested in her.

854
00:43:23,786 --> 00:43:25,617
He would be like, "Right. She went to work."

855
00:43:25,617 --> 00:43:27,016
- He wouldn't notice that. - Right. That's true.

856
00:43:27,016 --> 00:43:29,027
- He wanted to talk to her... - Right.

857
00:43:29,027 --> 00:43:31,126
when she returned home, but she looked tired.

858
00:43:31,297 --> 00:43:32,657
- That's why they couldn't talk. - Right.

859
00:43:32,657 --> 00:43:34,027
What kind of food do you like?

860
00:43:34,197 --> 00:43:36,697
I started to eat natto recently.

861
00:43:36,827 --> 00:43:39,836
- I like natto too. - Not a lot of people like natto.

862
00:43:39,836 --> 00:43:42,336
I don't actively look for it, but when I have it, I eat it often.

863
00:43:42,336 --> 00:43:44,007
- Is that so? - Yes. Natto.

864
00:43:44,777 --> 00:43:46,407
- I didn't know you liked natto. - Yes.

865
00:43:46,407 --> 00:43:48,476
It's good for digestion. Isn't that superfood?

866
00:43:48,646 --> 00:43:49,777
- Exactly. - Yes.

867
00:43:50,007 --> 00:43:51,717
You might be on the older side of the group.

868
00:43:53,317 --> 00:43:54,347
Right?

869
00:43:54,347 --> 00:43:55,947
- I think you're older than me. - I see.

870
00:43:55,947 --> 00:43:57,856
- Well, that's possible. - Right?

871
00:43:57,987 --> 00:43:59,657
- Don't you have a younger sister? - Me?

872
00:43:59,657 --> 00:44:00,956
Wait. Are we not allowed to talk about this.

873
00:44:00,956 --> 00:44:02,757
- Can we? - I almost...

874
00:44:04,126 --> 00:44:06,356
answered it. My answer came up to here.

875
00:44:07,297 --> 00:44:08,327
- You almost said it, right? - Right here.

876
00:44:08,327 --> 00:44:09,597
I stopped it here.

877
00:44:10,266 --> 00:44:12,197
I knew it.

878
00:44:12,467 --> 00:44:15,507
I thought that one couldn't hide one's DNA.

879
00:44:16,036 --> 00:44:17,407
I should wash it down with my beer.

880
00:44:17,577 --> 00:44:18,637
Go back in.

881
00:44:19,806 --> 00:44:22,746
Wait. Didn't he reveal his last name by mistake?

882
00:44:22,746 --> 00:44:23,947
- It was him. - At the bowling alley?

883
00:44:23,947 --> 00:44:25,077
- He did. - "It's Lee Yong Woo."

884
00:44:26,947 --> 00:44:28,016
- Right. - Right.

885
00:44:28,016 --> 00:44:29,916
He almost got caught that he has a younger sister.

886
00:44:30,387 --> 00:44:32,757
I get the feeling that you're older than me.

887
00:44:33,286 --> 00:44:34,527
- Why is that? - I get that feeling.

888
00:44:34,626 --> 00:44:37,757
I think you'll be good at taking care of your sister.

889
00:44:38,126 --> 00:44:39,297
No?

890
00:44:40,896 --> 00:44:42,766
I can't answer that.

891
00:44:44,697 --> 00:44:46,166
I think you're a caring big brother.

892
00:44:46,237 --> 00:44:47,836
Gosh. Thank you for saying that.

893
00:44:47,836 --> 00:44:50,567
Telling me that I would be good at taking care of someone...

894
00:44:50,567 --> 00:44:51,777
sounds like a compliment.

895
00:44:53,277 --> 00:44:55,806
Do you tend to show affection in an indirect way?

896
00:44:55,907 --> 00:44:57,876
Or do you openly show your affection?

897
00:44:59,916 --> 00:45:02,617
I would say I fall into the former group.

898
00:45:02,646 --> 00:45:05,317
- Is that so? - But in that group,

899
00:45:05,317 --> 00:45:07,286
I would express my affection the most.

900
00:45:07,757 --> 00:45:09,027
That's my answer.

901
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:11,226
That's unexpected.

902
00:45:12,197 --> 00:45:13,297
What about you?

903
00:45:13,427 --> 00:45:15,597
- Me? Okay. - You can tell me in a minute.

904
00:45:15,766 --> 00:45:17,027
Keep it for now.

905
00:45:18,067 --> 00:45:19,367
What's this?

906
00:45:19,737 --> 00:45:20,907
The pot rice with red tilefish.

907
00:45:20,907 --> 00:45:23,407
- The pot rice. - I see. That's the red tilefish.

908
00:45:23,907 --> 00:45:25,237
Let me put some of the food onto your plate.

909
00:45:25,237 --> 00:45:27,706
While I do that, you can tell me your answer.

910
00:45:28,677 --> 00:45:32,646
In my opinion, when I like someone,

911
00:45:33,117 --> 00:45:35,387
I don't stop myself from expressing...

912
00:45:35,387 --> 00:45:36,646
- Is that so? - my affection.

913
00:45:36,746 --> 00:45:39,016
But the recipient of my affection...

914
00:45:39,617 --> 00:45:43,327
- don't always agree with it. - Really?

915
00:45:43,327 --> 00:45:46,257
How should I put it? They didn't always think...

916
00:45:46,257 --> 00:45:48,967
that I expressed my feelings a lot,

917
00:45:48,967 --> 00:45:50,097
but by my standards,

918
00:45:50,097 --> 00:45:52,467
- You did. - I did.

919
00:45:52,467 --> 00:45:54,536
- I can see how that happened. - Really?

920
00:45:54,536 --> 00:45:56,137
- Because we're all different. - Yes.

921
00:45:56,706 --> 00:45:57,777
Do you want to try it?

922
00:45:57,777 --> 00:45:59,106
- Is it for me? - Yes.

923
00:45:59,106 --> 00:46:00,577
Thank you.

924
00:46:01,146 --> 00:46:03,507
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

925
00:46:04,146 --> 00:46:06,047
- It smells so good. - Yes.

926
00:46:09,686 --> 00:46:11,686
It's delicious. What is it on top?

927
00:46:12,956 --> 00:46:14,586
- This one? - Yes.

928
00:46:15,157 --> 00:46:16,586
(He doesn't know, so he tries it.)

929
00:46:18,626 --> 00:46:20,226
We're loving this, right?

930
00:46:20,726 --> 00:46:23,166
We would be fighting over this if we hadn't ordered it.

931
00:46:25,166 --> 00:46:27,567
Actually, I didn't know...

932
00:46:27,567 --> 00:46:29,936
that you were the type who actively talks like this.

933
00:46:29,936 --> 00:46:31,177
- Is that so? - Yes.

934
00:46:31,277 --> 00:46:34,677
I'm shy when I'm around many people.

935
00:46:34,677 --> 00:46:35,947
But when I'm alone with someone,

936
00:46:35,947 --> 00:46:38,976
or there's someone I keep talking to,

937
00:46:38,976 --> 00:46:40,047
I talk a lot.

938
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:41,987
- You talk more to a smaller group. - Right.

939
00:46:42,246 --> 00:46:44,416
- You're making me comfortable too. - Me?

940
00:46:44,416 --> 00:46:46,856
- Yes. And you're letting me talk. - I do?

941
00:46:46,856 --> 00:46:49,257
That makes me keep talking.

942
00:46:50,757 --> 00:46:53,697
Actually, I tend to ask...

943
00:46:53,697 --> 00:46:55,067
why a lot.

944
00:46:55,067 --> 00:46:56,097
Is that all right?

945
00:46:56,097 --> 00:46:58,036
That's okay, but why is that?

946
00:46:58,036 --> 00:47:00,836
That's how I...

947
00:47:02,106 --> 00:47:04,806
- express my interest in the person. - Is that so?

948
00:47:04,806 --> 00:47:06,936
- By asking why? - I keep asking...

949
00:47:06,936 --> 00:47:09,007
because I want to get to know the person.

950
00:47:09,007 --> 00:47:11,016
If we have just met, they might feel uncomfortable,

951
00:47:11,016 --> 00:47:13,447
so I try not to get carried away.

952
00:47:14,217 --> 00:47:16,347
I think you asked me why a few times today.

953
00:47:16,347 --> 00:47:17,447
- I did? - That's okay, though.

954
00:47:17,447 --> 00:47:18,516
- It is? - Yes.

955
00:47:23,927 --> 00:47:25,556
We couldn't take a group photo, so shall we take one today?

956
00:47:25,556 --> 00:47:27,356
- Yes. - Please let's try it today.

957
00:47:27,356 --> 00:47:28,896
When are Yong Woo and Cho A coming back?

958
00:47:29,896 --> 00:47:31,567
This suddenly occurred to me.

959
00:47:31,896 --> 00:47:33,137
- What? - I'm enjoying this already.

960
00:47:33,137 --> 00:47:35,036
- What is it? - It sounds fun already.

961
00:47:35,036 --> 00:47:37,036
- What is it about? - We...

962
00:47:37,467 --> 00:47:39,436
don't know how things will go.

963
00:47:40,507 --> 00:47:42,246
His intros are always so funny.

964
00:47:42,246 --> 00:47:44,007
We don't know what will happen,

965
00:47:44,007 --> 00:47:45,717
but I suggest...

966
00:47:46,077 --> 00:47:48,987
we do something when it rains or snows.

967
00:47:49,217 --> 00:47:50,317
What do you think?

968
00:47:51,217 --> 00:47:53,757
For example, we should cook something on a certain day.

969
00:47:53,757 --> 00:47:56,027
- Doesn't it sound good? - That sounds great.

970
00:47:56,456 --> 00:47:57,487
How about this?

971
00:47:57,726 --> 00:47:59,396
- When it rains or snows, - Yes.

972
00:47:59,927 --> 00:48:03,027
we have to express our feelings...

973
00:48:03,427 --> 00:48:06,197
for the person we're into.

974
00:48:06,637 --> 00:48:08,106
That sounds amazing.

975
00:48:08,106 --> 00:48:09,606
- What do you think? - You're quick-witted.

976
00:48:09,606 --> 00:48:11,507
- Are you an emcee? - That's impressive.

977
00:48:11,507 --> 00:48:12,777
Seriously.

978
00:48:13,007 --> 00:48:15,007
- It sounds good, right? - That sounds good.

979
00:48:15,007 --> 00:48:16,347
- In any way. - We could make a small gesture.

980
00:48:16,347 --> 00:48:19,047
- We must find a way. - Like Secret Santa.

981
00:48:19,376 --> 00:48:22,047
- You can give yourself away or not. - It's up to us.

982
00:48:22,246 --> 00:48:24,016
I love that idea.

983
00:48:24,286 --> 00:48:26,056
It's less likely to snow than rain.

984
00:48:26,217 --> 00:48:29,086
So we promised to show our feelings when it rains like Secret Santa.

985
00:48:30,186 --> 00:48:31,427
I hope it will snow.

986
00:48:33,396 --> 00:48:34,896
Are they doing something in the house?

987
00:48:35,467 --> 00:48:38,936
Should I make eye contact with Cheol Hyeon...

988
00:48:38,936 --> 00:48:40,036
and exchange questions again?

989
00:48:42,806 --> 00:48:45,007
You don't know how relaxed he makes me feel.

990
00:48:45,336 --> 00:48:46,577
Because Cheol Hyeon is around?

991
00:48:48,577 --> 00:48:52,317
You seem to feel comfortable around people...

992
00:48:52,317 --> 00:48:54,177
who are honest and innocent.

993
00:48:54,416 --> 00:48:55,487
That could be it.

994
00:48:55,487 --> 00:48:56,916
I haven't seen it that way.

995
00:48:56,916 --> 00:48:59,387
That's what I like about Cheol Hyeon.

996
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:01,056
That could be why I like him.

997
00:49:01,056 --> 00:49:03,887
If you feel at ease around someone...

998
00:49:03,887 --> 00:49:05,356
or attracted by them,

999
00:49:05,356 --> 00:49:07,827
that's because you have that side of them too.

1000
00:49:07,827 --> 00:49:08,896
I see.

1001
00:49:08,896 --> 00:49:11,567
I think that's why you feel that way.

1002
00:49:11,567 --> 00:49:13,297
We do have one thing in common, though.

1003
00:49:13,496 --> 00:49:15,367
- What is it? Understanding? - We don't understand at once.

1004
00:49:15,367 --> 00:49:17,036
You have a hard time understanding?

1005
00:49:17,737 --> 00:49:20,507
It's indeed complicated what it says on the pink cards.

1006
00:49:20,507 --> 00:49:21,806
- Right? - Yes.

1007
00:49:21,806 --> 00:49:23,407
Why doesn't anyone say that?

1008
00:49:23,547 --> 00:49:25,547
Because you guys said that first.

1009
00:49:26,117 --> 00:49:29,547
We just pretended that we understood it...

1010
00:49:29,547 --> 00:49:31,516
- The others just looked at us, - since you two already said it.

1011
00:49:31,516 --> 00:49:33,916
and he and I just looked at each other.

1012
00:49:34,757 --> 00:49:37,226
Time goes so fast.

1013
00:49:37,556 --> 00:49:38,996
I know.

1014
00:49:38,996 --> 00:49:39,996
- Shall we leave? - Shall we?

1015
00:49:41,967 --> 00:49:43,766
- Thank you. - Sure.

1016
00:49:45,336 --> 00:49:47,137
You're so tall.

1017
00:49:47,137 --> 00:49:48,137
- Me? - Yes.

1018
00:49:48,137 --> 00:49:50,967
When you first came in, I thought you were really tall.

1019
00:49:51,606 --> 00:49:52,677
- I am? - Yes.

1020
00:49:53,476 --> 00:49:55,847
Cho A is such a warm person.

1021
00:49:55,847 --> 00:49:57,777
When talking to her,

1022
00:49:57,947 --> 00:50:01,717
I could feel how thoughtful and warm-hearted she was.

1023
00:50:01,847 --> 00:50:06,117
My impressions of him completely changed...

1024
00:50:06,117 --> 00:50:07,757
after spending time with him.

1025
00:50:08,027 --> 00:50:11,056
At first, he seemed really cold...

1026
00:50:11,056 --> 00:50:13,356
and to have a mind of his own.

1027
00:50:13,626 --> 00:50:16,827
I didn't expect there to be another side to him.

1028
00:50:16,827 --> 00:50:18,597
It turns out he's really sensitive...

1029
00:50:18,597 --> 00:50:22,206
and very considerate of others.

1030
00:50:22,306 --> 00:50:24,306
At the beginning,

1031
00:50:24,306 --> 00:50:27,336
I didn't think our conversation would go on...

1032
00:50:27,336 --> 00:50:29,277
for a long time.

1033
00:50:29,277 --> 00:50:30,476
As we kept talking,

1034
00:50:30,476 --> 00:50:33,516
I thought we actually hit it off.

1035
00:50:34,117 --> 00:50:36,246
The car door is a little heavy.

1036
00:50:36,686 --> 00:50:38,317
- The colour is so pretty. - Right?

1037
00:50:38,317 --> 00:50:39,356
Yes.

1038
00:50:40,286 --> 00:50:41,527
- Thanks. - Sure.

1039
00:50:42,086 --> 00:50:43,786
- Wait. Yes. - It's a little high, right?

1040
00:50:43,786 --> 00:50:44,797
(The running board is a little high.)

1041
00:50:45,027 --> 00:50:46,856
- Are you okay? - Yes. Thanks.

1042
00:50:49,597 --> 00:50:51,297
Are your hands usually warm?

1043
00:50:51,297 --> 00:50:53,567
- They usually are. - I see.

1044
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:55,567
- What about you? - My hands are really cold.

1045
00:50:55,567 --> 00:50:58,737
- They are? - So I need hand warmers in winter.

1046
00:50:58,737 --> 00:51:00,007
I can imagine.

1047
00:51:00,007 --> 00:51:02,706
My hands are not that cold.

1048
00:51:03,447 --> 00:51:05,016
As if I had a built-in hand warmer.

1049
00:51:05,016 --> 00:51:06,976
That would be nice.

1050
00:51:08,286 --> 00:51:11,257
If you feel like you'll get frostbite,

1051
00:51:11,556 --> 00:51:12,657
ask me for help.

1052
00:51:14,086 --> 00:51:16,226
I'll lend you my natural hand warmer.

1053
00:51:20,456 --> 00:51:21,797
Gosh.

1054
00:51:21,797 --> 00:51:22,996
What was that?

1055
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:25,436
- What does that mean? - Natural hand warmer?

1056
00:51:25,436 --> 00:51:27,836
- He will become her hand warmer. - Can you answer us?

1057
00:51:27,836 --> 00:51:30,306
What do you think it means?

1058
00:51:30,306 --> 00:51:32,777
- He will warm her hands himself. - This means...

1059
00:51:32,907 --> 00:51:34,677
- he wants to hold her hands. - Right.

1060
00:51:34,677 --> 00:51:37,047
- What is it? - Good job, Yong Woo.

1061
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:38,677
I won't call him Yong Woo anymore.

1062
00:51:38,677 --> 00:51:40,077
He's Mr. Hand Warmer.

1063
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:41,487
Look at her face.

1064
00:51:41,487 --> 00:51:43,016
- Look at Cho A's face. - My heart is fluttering.

1065
00:51:43,016 --> 00:51:44,246
- It makes my heart pound. - It's fluttering.

1066
00:51:44,447 --> 00:51:46,516
I'll lend you my natural hand warmer.

1067
00:51:51,027 --> 00:51:52,027
Aren't you cold?

1068
00:51:52,427 --> 00:51:54,567
- Now I feel better. - You feel better?

1069
00:51:57,367 --> 00:51:58,496
(Cho A and Hand Warmer arrive.)

1070
00:51:58,496 --> 00:51:59,496
That's good.

1071
00:52:03,367 --> 00:52:04,367
Do you want me to hold your hands?

1072
00:52:07,806 --> 00:52:09,146
- Thank you. - Sure.

1073
00:52:09,146 --> 00:52:10,206
Your hands.

1074
00:52:10,777 --> 00:52:12,347
- They're burning, right? - I...

1075
00:52:13,146 --> 00:52:14,617
almost burned my hands.

1076
00:52:15,317 --> 00:52:16,547
I thought I held a hand warmer.

1077
00:52:17,447 --> 00:52:19,757
You must have touched the hand warmer.

1078
00:52:19,757 --> 00:52:20,987
I thought it was a hand warmer.

1079
00:52:21,217 --> 00:52:23,257
I thought I grabbed a hand warmer at first.

1080
00:52:23,586 --> 00:52:24,697
Her hands were warm.

1081
00:52:30,697 --> 00:52:33,137
My hands were burning at that time.

1082
00:52:33,737 --> 00:52:37,137
I was holding a hand warmer tightly.

1083
00:52:37,436 --> 00:52:39,277
It made my hands warmer than his,

1084
00:52:39,277 --> 00:52:41,646
so I couldn't feel how warm his hands were.

1085
00:52:42,777 --> 00:52:44,347
That's a little sad.

1086
00:52:46,047 --> 00:52:49,146
(Everyone is spending time by themselves in the house.)

1087
00:53:00,297 --> 00:53:02,226
(Starting today, the basement hideout is open...)

1088
00:53:02,226 --> 00:53:04,197
(for a 1-on-1 chat with the opposite gender.)

1089
00:53:04,867 --> 00:53:08,007
(The hideout is now open.)

1090
00:53:08,206 --> 00:53:09,407
(Write down the person's name and the time for reservation.)

1091
00:53:09,407 --> 00:53:10,737
(After completing the reservation,)

1092
00:53:10,737 --> 00:53:12,036
(please flip the sign to "in use" before using the space.)

1093
00:53:12,177 --> 00:53:14,777
(Reserving it right away)

1094
00:53:15,507 --> 00:53:18,047
I thought I should use it with my sister right away,

1095
00:53:19,277 --> 00:53:21,987
so I reserved a time with my sister immediately.

1096
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:26,757
(I book the hideout to use with Lee Yun Ha in 15 minutes.)

1097
00:53:26,817 --> 00:53:28,657
- All right. - Right.

1098
00:53:28,657 --> 00:53:30,786
He booked it quickly to talk with his sister.

1099
00:53:30,786 --> 00:53:33,626
- That's... - What will they talk about?

1100
00:53:33,757 --> 00:53:35,297
What are they going to talk about?

1101
00:53:35,766 --> 00:53:38,467
(Yong Woo and Cho A return.)

1102
00:53:39,197 --> 00:53:41,706
Thank you.

1103
00:53:42,036 --> 00:53:43,166
It seems like everyone is sleeping.

1104
00:53:43,836 --> 00:53:45,306
- Hello. - Hello.

1105
00:53:45,306 --> 00:53:48,047
- Cheol Hyeon. - Cho A.

1106
00:53:48,606 --> 00:53:49,706
Why are you so late?

1107
00:53:49,907 --> 00:53:52,246
- How are you? - Yong Woo and Cho A are here.

1108
00:53:52,246 --> 00:53:53,947
Were you waiting for us?

1109
00:53:54,246 --> 00:53:55,547
Sure. We were waiting for a long time.

1110
00:53:55,547 --> 00:53:56,646
- Is that so? - Did you arrive together?

1111
00:53:56,987 --> 00:53:59,117
- You came home together? - What?

1112
00:53:59,117 --> 00:54:00,786
- You two came together? - Yes. We met on the way.

1113
00:54:00,786 --> 00:54:01,927
That's great.

1114
00:54:02,586 --> 00:54:03,657
What were you doing?

1115
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:05,827
We were having a good time.

1116
00:54:05,827 --> 00:54:09,266
(Yong Woo and Cho A came home together.)

1117
00:54:10,396 --> 00:54:11,967
(Laughing)

1118
00:54:14,166 --> 00:54:16,467
Well, I thought...

1119
00:54:17,266 --> 00:54:19,836
Cho A and Jung Sub had a date.

1120
00:54:20,106 --> 00:54:22,476
That was the impression I got.

1121
00:54:23,246 --> 00:54:24,717
"The production crew is trying to trick me."

1122
00:54:25,376 --> 00:54:26,876
That's what I thought.

1123
00:54:26,876 --> 00:54:28,887
I thought they were going to come in soon,

1124
00:54:28,887 --> 00:54:30,987
but they took so much longer than I thought.

1125
00:54:30,987 --> 00:54:33,487
So I assumed they waited outside for a while.

1126
00:54:33,956 --> 00:54:35,157
That's what I thought too.

1127
00:54:37,356 --> 00:54:40,027
- You're finally home. - Yes. What have you been doing?

1128
00:54:40,356 --> 00:54:41,927
Why are you home so late?

1129
00:54:42,266 --> 00:54:43,467
Did you guys have a lot of fun?

1130
00:54:43,467 --> 00:54:45,036
Goodness.

1131
00:54:46,367 --> 00:54:47,396
It was so much fun.

1132
00:54:47,637 --> 00:54:49,036
What did you guys do?

1133
00:54:49,036 --> 00:54:51,166
- Why are you back so late? - What?

1134
00:54:51,166 --> 00:54:52,706
- Do you work tomorrow too? - Yes.

1135
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:53,777
Me too.

1136
00:54:53,777 --> 00:54:55,407
When my sister came home,

1137
00:54:55,407 --> 00:54:58,146
Jung Sub looked so happy.

1138
00:54:58,146 --> 00:55:01,117
He was talking really fast.

1139
00:55:01,117 --> 00:55:03,617
I was watching how they talked to each other.

1140
00:55:03,617 --> 00:55:05,117
She and he gave off the vibe...

1141
00:55:05,387 --> 00:55:07,856
that they went on a date.

1142
00:55:07,856 --> 00:55:11,556
I don't know if others felt that way too,

1143
00:55:11,896 --> 00:55:13,297
but that's what I sensed.

1144
00:55:13,626 --> 00:55:16,427
- Gosh. - He went too far.

1145
00:55:16,427 --> 00:55:18,867
It's funny how he thinks he's a good detective now.

1146
00:55:19,336 --> 00:55:21,297
- He thinks he's sharp. - Yes.

1147
00:55:21,297 --> 00:55:23,567
- He thinks... - "This is a trick."

1148
00:55:23,567 --> 00:55:25,106
It's because he has his own answer in his mind.

1149
00:55:25,106 --> 00:55:27,436
- He can only see it that way. - Right.

1150
00:55:27,436 --> 00:55:29,146
That's the scary power of believing what you want.

1151
00:55:29,146 --> 00:55:30,476
Oh, my.

1152
00:55:31,746 --> 00:55:34,617
- You two seem so excited. - Right?

1153
00:55:37,847 --> 00:55:40,416
(Jung Sub is nearing the hideout reservation time.)

1154
00:55:40,717 --> 00:55:44,827
(He's roaming around so they don't know their siblings.)

1155
00:55:46,597 --> 00:55:47,697
- Is that so? - Yes.

1156
00:55:47,996 --> 00:55:50,027
- So what did you do today? - It's a secret.

1157
00:55:50,027 --> 00:55:52,137
Is it a secret?

1158
00:55:52,967 --> 00:55:55,336
Where are you going?

1159
00:55:55,836 --> 00:55:57,336
Sir, where are you going?

1160
00:55:58,637 --> 00:56:00,737
Actually, I didn't really have time...

1161
00:56:00,737 --> 00:56:03,947
to check if they saw us or not.

1162
00:56:04,106 --> 00:56:06,777
I just wanted to hear from my sister.

1163
00:56:06,777 --> 00:56:08,987
That's what I was mostly thinking.

1164
00:56:09,686 --> 00:56:10,987
I'm just going down.

1165
00:56:18,356 --> 00:56:20,396
(He met his older sister.)

1166
00:56:20,396 --> 00:56:23,597
It's okay to come in while everyone is looking, right?

1167
00:56:25,967 --> 00:56:27,137
Why did you want to talk with me?

1168
00:56:29,666 --> 00:56:30,737
I was curious.

1169
00:56:30,737 --> 00:56:33,306
Me too. I'm really curious too.

1170
00:56:34,237 --> 00:56:36,047
We can speak informally here.

1171
00:56:36,047 --> 00:56:37,746
(The 1-on-1 conversation begins. You're allowed to speak informally.)

1172
00:56:37,746 --> 00:56:38,777
I see.

1173
00:56:39,217 --> 00:56:41,347
Finally.

1174
00:56:41,347 --> 00:56:42,617
(Relieved)

1175
00:56:43,186 --> 00:56:44,916
- Are you a genius? - Yes.

1176
00:56:45,356 --> 00:56:48,186
I was so happy at that time.

1177
00:56:48,456 --> 00:56:50,556
I had a lot on my mind,

1178
00:56:51,387 --> 00:56:53,827
so I couldn't wait to talk to him there.

1179
00:56:54,197 --> 00:56:56,666
I was so happy to see her.

1180
00:56:56,666 --> 00:56:58,597
I called her in because I was worried about her.

1181
00:56:59,996 --> 00:57:01,436
You made a good move.

1182
00:57:01,436 --> 00:57:02,637
I know.

1183
00:57:02,637 --> 00:57:04,306
Your outfit looked good today.

1184
00:57:04,306 --> 00:57:05,836
- Really? - Yes, it really did.

1185
00:57:05,836 --> 00:57:07,737
- Did you have a good time? - What? I did.

1186
00:57:09,106 --> 00:57:13,217
It looks like Cho A really enjoyed her date today.

1187
00:57:13,677 --> 00:57:15,487
I thought you went out with Cho A.

1188
00:57:15,516 --> 00:57:16,717
No, I didn't.

1189
00:57:17,016 --> 00:57:18,487
Then Se Seung?

1190
00:57:19,717 --> 00:57:21,186
I think you two look good together.

1191
00:57:22,027 --> 00:57:23,987
Jung Sub, you're doing great.

1192
00:57:23,987 --> 00:57:26,226
- I really... - Do you like how I'm doing?

1193
00:57:26,226 --> 00:57:28,097
- feel proud. - Really?

1194
00:57:28,097 --> 00:57:29,996
- I'm so happy for you. - Goodness.

1195
00:57:30,597 --> 00:57:33,237
I was worried about you, Yun Ha.

1196
00:57:34,536 --> 00:57:35,567
What did you do today?

1197
00:57:35,806 --> 00:57:37,606
I went to Namyangju and Sinsa-dong.

1198
00:57:37,606 --> 00:57:39,706
- I went to Sinsa-dong too. - I went to the Han River as well.

1199
00:57:41,407 --> 00:57:43,077
You went to that many places?

1200
00:57:43,306 --> 00:57:44,777
If you went to many places like that,

1201
00:57:44,777 --> 00:57:46,817
it must have been going well.

1202
00:57:46,817 --> 00:57:48,646
I don't know how my Cupid Date was arranged.

1203
00:57:48,847 --> 00:57:50,447
Have you tried guessing...

1204
00:57:50,447 --> 00:57:53,887
- I don't know. - how you two ended up together?

1205
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:56,257
I think the person who asked me out on Cupid Date...

1206
00:57:56,257 --> 00:57:57,827
was Se Seung.

1207
00:57:58,626 --> 00:58:00,427
(He still doesn't know.)

1208
00:58:00,427 --> 00:58:01,427
Are we allowed to talk about this?

1209
00:58:01,726 --> 00:58:02,766
- First, - Then...

1210
00:58:02,867 --> 00:58:06,166
I think the person who asked me out on the Cupid Date is Se Seung...

1211
00:58:09,137 --> 00:58:12,137
When I went to the date spot, she was waiting for me.

1212
00:58:12,536 --> 00:58:13,577
I see.

1213
00:58:13,577 --> 00:58:16,547
Then you must have received one message.

1214
00:58:17,507 --> 00:58:18,547
(Smiling)

1215
00:58:18,547 --> 00:58:19,617
- Right? - What?

1216
00:58:19,617 --> 00:58:21,376
- You must have received one. - Yes.

1217
00:58:21,376 --> 00:58:23,586
Right? That's why you gave me one.

1218
00:58:24,047 --> 00:58:26,586
- And the other three messages... - Yes.

1219
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:28,726
including yours and Ju Yeon's are...

1220
00:58:29,856 --> 00:58:31,027
I don't know what happened to those messages.

1221
00:58:31,286 --> 00:58:33,726
I think my message wasn't chosen.

1222
00:58:33,726 --> 00:58:34,726
What?

1223
00:58:34,827 --> 00:58:38,996
Since the women had to be Cupid for their siblings,

1224
00:58:39,266 --> 00:58:41,367
I think Ju Yeon chose.

1225
00:58:42,106 --> 00:58:43,666
I think she chose the woman.

1226
00:58:43,936 --> 00:58:45,677
"I want my brother to go on a date with this woman."

1227
00:58:45,677 --> 00:58:48,177
I have a feeling that she was the one who chose.

1228
00:58:48,507 --> 00:58:51,547
I think other messages were distributed automatically.

1229
00:58:51,547 --> 00:58:53,916
- I see. - That's how it was arranged.

1230
00:58:54,947 --> 00:58:57,447
Then I've been receiving zero votes from the start.

1231
00:58:58,487 --> 00:59:01,056
- The women first chose... - No.

1232
00:59:01,056 --> 00:59:02,086
(Yun Ha assumed her Cupid Message wasn't chosen by Ju Yeon.)

1233
00:59:02,086 --> 00:59:03,927
It just went that way.

1234
00:59:04,387 --> 00:59:06,956
I did receive zero votes on the first day, though.

1235
00:59:06,956 --> 00:59:08,367
(She thinks she received 0 votes in the text vote on the 1st day.)

1236
00:59:08,367 --> 00:59:10,626
Other people...

1237
00:59:11,297 --> 00:59:14,336
I got zero votes as soon as I moved in,

1238
00:59:14,597 --> 00:59:16,666
so it made me feel timid.

1239
00:59:17,237 --> 00:59:19,306
I had a lot going on in my mind.

1240
00:59:20,177 --> 00:59:21,847
- It's not a big deal. - Right.

1241
00:59:21,847 --> 00:59:24,007
- It's only been three days. - Sure.

1242
00:59:24,007 --> 00:59:25,277
They are there...

1243
00:59:25,277 --> 00:59:28,217
- to find love, after all. - Right.

1244
00:59:28,217 --> 00:59:30,387
It wouldn't bother her that much if she was alone,

1245
00:59:30,387 --> 00:59:32,157
but her family is there, watching her.

1246
00:59:32,916 --> 00:59:35,987
- That's why it's more stressful. - Yes.

1247
00:59:36,186 --> 00:59:37,927
I saw your face as soon as I received the text.

1248
00:59:38,056 --> 00:59:39,496
Could you tell from my face?

1249
00:59:39,496 --> 00:59:41,456
- I could tell you were not happy. - Right.

1250
00:59:41,867 --> 00:59:44,666
- I felt blue all day long. - It must have been hard.

1251
00:59:44,666 --> 00:59:47,367
- I was so worried about you. - I was totally crushed.

1252
00:59:47,367 --> 00:59:49,336
Of course. I can imagine.

1253
00:59:49,336 --> 00:59:50,467
I was worried.

1254
00:59:51,336 --> 00:59:52,806
That's why you booked the hideout right away.

1255
00:59:52,806 --> 00:59:54,806
I really wanted to tell you this.

1256
00:59:55,106 --> 00:59:56,206
I'm glad that you did.

1257
00:59:56,206 --> 00:59:58,617
You're doing so well...

1258
00:59:58,876 --> 01:00:01,746
- and... - I'm getting tearful.

1259
01:00:06,887 --> 01:00:08,186
Seriously though,

1260
01:00:08,186 --> 01:00:11,657
- I already cried inside. - I know.

1261
01:00:11,657 --> 01:00:13,396
I know how you must be feeling.

1262
01:00:15,567 --> 01:00:17,396
I feel like crying for real now.

1263
01:00:18,126 --> 01:00:19,697
You're doing great.

1264
01:00:20,396 --> 01:00:22,336
I really wanted to leave today.

1265
01:00:24,507 --> 01:00:26,907
I thought you did. I knew it.

1266
01:00:26,907 --> 01:00:28,036
It was a long day.

1267
01:00:28,036 --> 01:00:30,277
It was, wasn't it?

1268
01:00:30,277 --> 01:00:31,817
It must have been a tough day emotionally.

1269
01:00:32,847 --> 01:00:34,817
What matters is what you do from now on.

1270
01:00:39,317 --> 01:00:41,657
He comforted me about it,

1271
01:00:41,657 --> 01:00:45,027
so I couldn't help crying there.

1272
01:00:46,427 --> 01:00:49,967
It was my first time looking vulnerable in front of him.

1273
01:00:51,367 --> 01:00:52,996
We have a big age difference,

1274
01:00:52,996 --> 01:00:55,507
but he knows me well,

1275
01:00:55,507 --> 01:00:58,536
which helped me a lot...

1276
01:00:58,536 --> 01:00:59,606
at that moment.

1277
01:01:00,007 --> 01:01:03,507
She was tearing up a little.

1278
01:01:03,507 --> 01:01:07,016
It must mean it'd been bothering her...

1279
01:01:07,347 --> 01:01:10,047
and stressing her out.

1280
01:01:11,016 --> 01:01:12,487
That broke my heart.

1281
01:01:14,356 --> 01:01:17,226
- He's so sweet. - I know.

1282
01:01:17,226 --> 01:01:18,726
I realize he's a good person more and more.

1283
01:01:18,726 --> 01:01:20,896
- He's a perfect man. - Yes.

1284
01:01:22,097 --> 01:01:23,597
I'm so jealous.

1285
01:01:23,597 --> 01:01:26,137
How can he be so nice and ask her how she's doing?

1286
01:01:26,867 --> 01:01:28,097
I take it back.

1287
01:01:28,507 --> 01:01:30,036
- Jonathan, ask her... - You could say that to her.

1288
01:01:30,036 --> 01:01:33,036
- if she had a long day today. - It's okay.

1289
01:01:33,036 --> 01:01:34,036
Aren't you hungry?

1290
01:01:38,146 --> 01:01:39,717
- A tailored question for her. - Gosh.

1291
01:01:39,717 --> 01:01:41,916
- "Aren't you hungry?" - It's customized for you.

1292
01:01:41,916 --> 01:01:42,916
My goodness.

1293
01:01:42,916 --> 01:01:43,916
Their situation and ours...

1294
01:01:43,916 --> 01:01:44,987
- are different. - Isn't that better?

1295
01:01:45,016 --> 01:01:47,117
- Oh, dear. - That made my tears dry up.

1296
01:01:47,117 --> 01:01:49,086
I noticed that she kept looking at that.

1297
01:01:49,556 --> 01:01:51,956
- It's indeed a little far away. - It's too far to grab some.

1298
01:01:51,956 --> 01:01:54,097
- I was thinking of trying some. - Okay.

1299
01:01:54,556 --> 01:01:55,996
She will start inhaling soon.

1300
01:01:58,126 --> 01:02:01,036
You're just having a heartbreak early.

1301
01:02:01,867 --> 01:02:05,876
I think Se Seung got lots of votes.

1302
01:02:06,137 --> 01:02:07,936
- She must have received three. - I'm not sure.

1303
01:02:07,936 --> 01:02:09,907
- No, at least two. - Se Seung...

1304
01:02:10,007 --> 01:02:13,777
- She talked a lot to people... - Yes.

1305
01:02:13,777 --> 01:02:15,646
since the day we moved in.

1306
01:02:15,646 --> 01:02:17,847
- She pays attention when you talk. - Yes.

1307
01:02:17,847 --> 01:02:19,887
- She's a good listener. - I can't be like that.

1308
01:02:19,887 --> 01:02:21,956
Right. But that's important.

1309
01:02:22,487 --> 01:02:23,757
If you don't talk, you seem uninterested.

1310
01:02:23,757 --> 01:02:24,827
Right.

1311
01:02:24,827 --> 01:02:27,027
It's important to react a lot when someone talks.

1312
01:02:27,027 --> 01:02:28,396
It's crucial.

1313
01:02:28,726 --> 01:02:30,626
We're learning about life here.

1314
01:02:31,027 --> 01:02:33,036
- I really learned a lesson. - You did?

1315
01:02:33,036 --> 01:02:34,996
I'm struggling so hard...

1316
01:02:34,996 --> 01:02:37,706
- to survive among the giants. - You're the best in my eyes.

1317
01:02:40,806 --> 01:02:42,606
When all of you are sitting,

1318
01:02:42,907 --> 01:02:44,077
you look the most handsome.

1319
01:02:44,077 --> 01:02:45,077
Really?

1320
01:02:45,146 --> 01:02:46,277
(Gasping)

1321
01:02:46,277 --> 01:02:47,277
I should stay seated.

1322
01:02:49,347 --> 01:02:53,657
Also, when you're with the men, don't stand in the middle.

1323
01:02:53,657 --> 01:02:55,356
- Should I stay away from them? - Yes.

1324
01:02:55,356 --> 01:02:56,786
I didn't know where to stand.

1325
01:02:57,356 --> 01:02:58,427
Give me a tip.

1326
01:02:58,726 --> 01:03:01,556
Confuse them a little.

1327
01:03:01,626 --> 01:03:04,797
(While the siblings are having a heart-to-heart)

1328
01:03:06,697 --> 01:03:07,936
- By the way... - Who is in there?

1329
01:03:07,936 --> 01:03:09,166
- What? - The man...

1330
01:03:09,666 --> 01:03:11,436
Jung Sub.

1331
01:03:11,976 --> 01:03:13,476
Right. Jung Sub went in alone.

1332
01:03:13,476 --> 01:03:15,447
Wait. Is it reserved already?

1333
01:03:16,007 --> 01:03:18,306
I think so. Who is the woman?

1334
01:03:18,976 --> 01:03:22,347
I don't think Se Seung and Jae Hyung are siblings.

1335
01:03:22,686 --> 01:03:24,817
- They're so different, right? - They are.

1336
01:03:24,817 --> 01:03:29,086
They were the first two participants who moved in as well.

1337
01:03:30,327 --> 01:03:32,297
That makes me think they're not related even more.

1338
01:03:32,657 --> 01:03:34,097
And they don't look alike at all.

1339
01:03:34,396 --> 01:03:37,927
I think Cheol Hyeon likes Se Seung, though.

1340
01:03:38,637 --> 01:03:40,166
It's just my opinion.

1341
01:03:40,436 --> 01:03:43,436
But he keeps complimenting her and saying she's pretty.

1342
01:03:43,436 --> 01:03:45,407
- He said she was pretty? - Well...

1343
01:03:45,976 --> 01:03:47,577
He keeps making comments...

1344
01:03:47,577 --> 01:03:48,746
about her.

1345
01:03:49,206 --> 01:03:50,206
I see.

1346
01:03:51,347 --> 01:03:52,947
Cheol Hyeon likes Se Seung.

1347
01:03:53,646 --> 01:03:55,516
Still, we don't know how it will go.

1348
01:03:55,746 --> 01:03:56,786
Am I too red?

1349
01:04:01,586 --> 01:04:04,226
We couldn't take a Polaroid photo today.

1350
01:04:04,226 --> 01:04:06,597
Shall we take one just us?

1351
01:04:06,597 --> 01:04:08,697
- I'd love to. - Shall we take one?

1352
01:04:09,567 --> 01:04:10,697
It looks pretty.

1353
01:04:10,697 --> 01:04:11,896
(The four of them gathered in the living room.)

1354
01:04:11,896 --> 01:04:12,967
Oh, dear.

1355
01:04:12,967 --> 01:04:14,396
Let me sit over here.

1356
01:04:15,197 --> 01:04:17,507
(Yong Woo sits closer.)

1357
01:04:22,606 --> 01:04:24,077
Did you see this?

1358
01:04:24,077 --> 01:04:28,016
Jae Hyung and Jung Sub took photos of each other.

1359
01:04:28,416 --> 01:04:31,487
They love each other so much...

1360
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:33,117
- Is that so? - that their photos look great.

1361
01:04:33,817 --> 01:04:36,887
How they took pictures of each other.

1362
01:04:38,626 --> 01:04:40,157
(Glancing over)

1363
01:04:41,626 --> 01:04:44,097
- Both of them look good. - Cheol Hyeon, we should do it too.

1364
01:04:44,226 --> 01:04:45,597
I know. Let's take a photo before going to bed.

1365
01:04:45,597 --> 01:04:46,867
Actually...

1366
01:04:47,797 --> 01:04:51,336
- What should we do? - How about Cho A and Yong Woo?

1367
01:04:52,476 --> 01:04:54,237
- Let's take one together. - The four of us.

1368
01:04:54,237 --> 01:04:55,606
- That sounds good. - The 4 of us should take 1.

1369
01:04:56,577 --> 01:04:58,347
(Yong Woo moves chairs to find the right angle.)

1370
01:04:58,347 --> 01:05:00,847
And you could put the camera here...

1371
01:05:00,847 --> 01:05:02,047
and secure it.

1372
01:05:02,347 --> 01:05:04,347
- How is the angle? - It looks good.

1373
01:05:04,347 --> 01:05:06,987
- What about the height? - It's perfect.

1374
01:05:07,416 --> 01:05:09,487
- Did you stack them up? - Yes.

1375
01:05:09,987 --> 01:05:11,157
The two of you can sit here.

1376
01:05:11,157 --> 01:05:13,856
- She could sit here. - Okay, then.

1377
01:05:17,726 --> 01:05:19,496
(Sitting)

1378
01:05:19,836 --> 01:05:20,836
This will work.

1379
01:05:25,976 --> 01:05:27,336
- One more? - One more?

1380
01:05:27,336 --> 01:05:29,777
It looks good already.

1381
01:05:29,777 --> 01:05:31,847
- It does? - It should be a little closer.

1382
01:05:34,577 --> 01:05:36,217
You have a good sense of balance.

1383
01:05:36,547 --> 01:05:39,086
You can lean against the couch.

1384
01:05:39,286 --> 01:05:40,356
We, Koreans, sit on the floor...

1385
01:05:40,356 --> 01:05:42,056
- with our backs against a couch. - Right.

1386
01:05:51,097 --> 01:05:53,036
My pose just now...

1387
01:05:53,036 --> 01:05:55,036
- You haven't posed well yet? - It looked like this.

1388
01:05:56,067 --> 01:05:57,737
- One more. - Let's take one more.

1389
01:05:57,737 --> 01:05:58,806
One more.

1390
01:06:02,306 --> 01:06:04,206
I feel like they'll take photos together in 30 years too.

1391
01:06:04,206 --> 01:06:06,047
- Oh, my. - As a family.

1392
01:06:06,047 --> 01:06:08,646
I hope they become a family like that.

1393
01:06:08,646 --> 01:06:10,317
My goodness. It's nice seeing them like that.

1394
01:06:11,186 --> 01:06:13,016
It was...

1395
01:06:15,456 --> 01:06:17,327
How do I put this?

1396
01:06:17,657 --> 01:06:20,896
We took pictures like couples.

1397
01:06:20,896 --> 01:06:23,396
Cho A and Yong Woo were sitting together,

1398
01:06:23,597 --> 01:06:26,197
and Ju Yeon and I were together.

1399
01:06:26,197 --> 01:06:28,967
I noticed we were wearing matching colours.

1400
01:06:29,106 --> 01:06:31,567
That was quite fun.

1401
01:06:31,907 --> 01:06:34,677
We looked good. We looked quite good together.

1402
01:06:34,677 --> 01:06:36,007
That's the vibe I felt.

1403
01:06:37,876 --> 01:06:40,047
(Yong Woo captured a moment.)

1404
01:06:40,317 --> 01:06:41,347
Take a photo of us.

1405
01:06:42,217 --> 01:06:43,887
- One, two, three. - One, two, three.

1406
01:06:46,387 --> 01:06:49,856
When I saw my sister and Yong Woo together,

1407
01:06:49,856 --> 01:06:50,987
I still thought they would make a good couple.

1408
01:06:51,456 --> 01:06:54,327
I've loved seeing them together from the start.

1409
01:06:54,956 --> 01:06:57,626
I can't stop feeling that way.

1410
01:06:58,527 --> 01:07:00,137
Well, it felt strange.

1411
01:07:00,137 --> 01:07:02,606
It felt a little strange too.

1412
01:07:03,067 --> 01:07:04,407
It'd only been three days,

1413
01:07:04,407 --> 01:07:08,177
and I felt like she already found her partner.

1414
01:07:08,177 --> 01:07:09,847
I had mixed feelings.

1415
01:07:10,476 --> 01:07:11,976
- You mean Cheol Hyeon? - I just...

1416
01:07:11,976 --> 01:07:14,177
I just love Cheol Hyeon.

1417
01:07:15,887 --> 01:07:17,717
Me too. I really like you too.

1418
01:07:19,217 --> 01:07:22,016
Let me play a really good song for you.

1419
01:07:25,726 --> 01:07:27,626
Christmas

1420
01:07:30,996 --> 01:07:32,737
What is it? It's a Christmas song.

1421
01:07:35,266 --> 01:07:36,637
Will we get to make a Christmas tree?

1422
01:07:38,036 --> 01:07:39,876
- Shall we do it? - Shall we?

1423
01:07:39,876 --> 01:07:41,277
- Let's make a Christmas tree. - That sounds good.

1424
01:07:41,277 --> 01:07:42,347
A tree.

1425
01:07:42,347 --> 01:07:44,876
- It'd be nice if we did that. - Yes. It'd look so nice.

1426
01:07:44,876 --> 01:07:47,447
- Right. - I like that idea.

1427
01:07:48,476 --> 01:07:49,817
I was so happy at that moment.

1428
01:07:50,217 --> 01:07:53,916
It was freezing outside, but it was warm inside.

1429
01:07:53,916 --> 01:07:56,427
And being with warm-hearted people there,

1430
01:07:57,126 --> 01:07:59,927
I loved the atmosphere at the moment.

1431
01:08:01,726 --> 01:08:05,067
I felt like I had...

1432
01:08:05,426 --> 01:08:07,037
a heartwarming night.

1433
01:08:07,037 --> 01:08:09,867
I felt something warm and fuzzy.

1434
01:08:09,867 --> 01:08:12,306
I also thought...

1435
01:08:12,306 --> 01:08:15,377
I wanted to spend more time with them.

1436
01:08:15,676 --> 01:08:18,877
Actually, I already have one in my mind.

1437
01:08:19,247 --> 01:08:20,277
It's Cho A.

1438
01:08:20,747 --> 01:08:22,917
She's elegant and graceful,

1439
01:08:22,917 --> 01:08:25,046
and I want to be like her in that way.

1440
01:08:25,317 --> 01:08:27,487
She seemed to take her time to warm up,

1441
01:08:27,886 --> 01:08:31,186
but she kept smiling warmly at me.

1442
01:08:31,426 --> 01:08:32,497
That...

1443
01:08:33,657 --> 01:08:35,457
just melted my heart.

1444
01:08:35,827 --> 01:08:37,926
That's why I don't go back to my room more often.

1445
01:08:38,167 --> 01:08:39,367
Because I want to hang out with Cho A.

1446
01:08:40,966 --> 01:08:42,567
I think she has a warm heart.

1447
01:08:43,407 --> 01:08:46,337
She looks like she would embrace everyone.

1448
01:08:47,907 --> 01:08:49,747
It was a long day today.

1449
01:08:50,006 --> 01:08:51,146
- Yes. - It was long.

1450
01:09:13,396 --> 01:09:15,396
(Next morning)

1451
01:09:15,966 --> 01:09:18,436
(Jung Sub wants to make French toast.)

1452
01:09:32,756 --> 01:09:34,457
It smells like steak.

1453
01:09:35,056 --> 01:09:36,127
In the morning?

1454
01:09:36,527 --> 01:09:38,657
I thought it smelled like eggs.

1455
01:09:39,096 --> 01:09:40,926
- I didn't know it was steak. - It could be eggs.

1456
01:09:41,096 --> 01:09:42,226
I think it's burnt.

1457
01:09:42,226 --> 01:09:44,367
(They can smell the burnt food even on the 2nd floor.)

1458
01:09:45,396 --> 01:09:46,537
It's burnt a little.

1459
01:09:47,896 --> 01:09:51,106
(It's burnt again.)

1460
01:09:53,077 --> 01:09:56,106
(He puts the burnt toast in his mouth.)

1461
01:09:56,947 --> 01:09:59,046
He burns his food all the time.

1462
01:09:59,046 --> 01:10:00,417
- It's burnt again? Gosh. - What? Again?

1463
01:10:00,577 --> 01:10:01,817
It's burnt.

1464
01:10:01,947 --> 01:10:05,186
(He tries again.)

1465
01:10:07,516 --> 01:10:09,926
(He must adjust the heat.)

1466
01:10:15,596 --> 01:10:17,567
(Tasting)

1467
01:10:19,337 --> 01:10:21,197
(He's very satisfied.)

1468
01:10:23,237 --> 01:10:24,367
Good. It's delicious.

1469
01:10:26,877 --> 01:10:28,976
(He leaves a note.)

1470
01:10:32,247 --> 01:10:33,247
Done.

1471
01:10:34,846 --> 01:10:38,546
(Eat the toast!)

1472
01:10:38,846 --> 01:10:40,256
Do you like essays?

1473
01:10:40,256 --> 01:10:41,386
When we go to a bookstore later,

1474
01:10:42,087 --> 01:10:44,627
- I'll give you a good one. - It will take about ten minutes...

1475
01:10:44,627 --> 01:10:46,256
for me to read one page.

1476
01:10:46,926 --> 01:10:48,796
- Have a rest and see you later. - See you later.

1477
01:10:51,367 --> 01:10:52,396
Let me...

1478
01:10:52,667 --> 01:10:54,466
use the lint roller to remove dust from his clothes.

1479
01:10:55,837 --> 01:10:56,837
Cheol Hyeon.

1480
01:10:57,766 --> 01:10:58,766
Just a second.

1481
01:10:59,636 --> 01:11:00,676
Thank you.

1482
01:11:01,237 --> 01:11:03,306
You shouldn't go like this wherever you go.

1483
01:11:04,247 --> 01:11:05,476
You can't go in this state.

1484
01:11:06,016 --> 01:11:07,247
You can't.

1485
01:11:09,186 --> 01:11:10,716
I understand why there was no dust in the house.

1486
01:11:10,716 --> 01:11:12,186
- It's all on your coat. - Yes.

1487
01:11:12,457 --> 01:11:14,317
You became a human lint roller.

1488
01:11:15,856 --> 01:11:17,587
Don't you think it was a great idea to get the lint roller?

1489
01:11:17,587 --> 01:11:18,756
Yes, it was.

1490
01:11:18,756 --> 01:11:20,896
(He thoroughly checks both the front and the back.)

1491
01:11:22,127 --> 01:11:23,827
- Yong Woo. - He likes Cheol Hyeon so much.

1492
01:11:23,827 --> 01:11:25,226
Take care of Cho A instead.

1493
01:11:26,037 --> 01:11:27,596
I think I know the feeling.

1494
01:11:27,596 --> 01:11:29,737
It might've made Cheol Hyeon's heart flutter.

1495
01:11:29,867 --> 01:11:31,806
- Yes. He accepted it too. - Yes.

1496
01:11:32,877 --> 01:11:34,737
- Thank you. - No worries.

1497
01:11:34,737 --> 01:11:36,447
- See you later. - See you later.

1498
01:11:37,006 --> 01:11:39,546
(Cheol Hyeon goes out.)

1499
01:11:39,976 --> 01:11:42,417
(Se Seung reads Cheol Hyeon's book.)

1500
01:11:45,987 --> 01:11:49,827
(That afternoon)

1501
01:11:50,827 --> 01:11:51,856
I'm back.

1502
01:11:52,287 --> 01:11:53,726
- You're back. - Yes. I'm back.

1503
01:11:53,726 --> 01:11:54,926
Why did you come so late?

1504
01:11:54,926 --> 01:11:56,027
Gosh, I'm sorry.

1505
01:11:57,127 --> 01:11:59,466
(As soon as he takes off his coat,)

1506
01:12:01,136 --> 01:12:03,037
(there's a rustle.)

1507
01:12:05,506 --> 01:12:08,207
(He puts a suspicious envelope in the drawer.)

1508
01:12:09,037 --> 01:12:11,346
(He puts chocolate under the chest.)

1509
01:12:13,016 --> 01:12:14,247
(Thinking)

1510
01:12:15,716 --> 01:12:17,686
(He takes out the chocolate again...)

1511
01:12:19,317 --> 01:12:23,756
(to put it deep in the closet.)

1512
01:12:29,567 --> 01:12:30,627
(Surprised)

1513
01:12:34,136 --> 01:12:35,367
How was your day?

1514
01:12:35,667 --> 01:12:36,667
Great.

1515
01:12:42,846 --> 01:12:43,846
Knock, knock.

1516
01:12:44,846 --> 01:12:45,846
Hey.

1517
01:12:46,046 --> 01:12:47,176
- Are you alone? - Yes.

1518
01:12:48,176 --> 01:12:49,287
You're back.

1519
01:12:49,447 --> 01:12:50,447
Yes.

1520
01:12:52,617 --> 01:12:53,817
Have you eaten?

1521
01:13:00,296 --> 01:13:01,756
- What's this? - It's just...

1522
01:13:03,327 --> 01:13:06,337
I couldn't just bring sea salt butter rolls.

1523
01:13:07,867 --> 01:13:09,037
So I got macarons too.

1524
01:13:34,056 --> 01:13:35,157
It felt good.

1525
01:13:35,527 --> 01:13:36,926
And I got shy a little.

1526
01:13:38,527 --> 01:13:40,337
It made my heart flutter a little.

1527
01:13:41,096 --> 01:13:44,167
We saw sea salt butter rolls when we had a Cupid Date.

1528
01:13:44,407 --> 01:13:46,976
She said she liked those things.

1529
01:13:47,207 --> 01:13:48,407
I thought...

1530
01:13:50,306 --> 01:13:52,577
it was a nice way to express my feelings.

1531
01:13:53,346 --> 01:13:55,817
- Goodness. - My gosh.

1532
01:13:56,016 --> 01:13:57,846
As expected of Jung Sub.

1533
01:13:58,216 --> 01:13:59,587
Expressing your feelings is very important.

1534
01:13:59,587 --> 01:14:01,556
- Seriously. - He's a very nice person.

1535
01:14:02,287 --> 01:14:03,556
- Shall we eat? - I'll enjoy the food.

1536
01:14:03,556 --> 01:14:05,627
- I'll enjoy the food. - I'll enjoy the food.

1537
01:14:05,627 --> 01:14:06,627
I'll enjoy the food.

1538
01:14:08,556 --> 01:14:09,627
This is amazing.

1539
01:14:10,926 --> 01:14:12,426
It's seriously so good.

1540
01:14:14,136 --> 01:14:15,766
Someone has come.

1541
01:14:16,106 --> 01:14:17,237
Who is it?

1542
01:14:17,367 --> 01:14:19,136
- You worked hard. Hi. - Hi.

1543
01:14:19,337 --> 01:14:20,676
Did you have dinner?

1544
01:14:20,676 --> 01:14:21,707
- No. - Hi.

1545
01:14:21,877 --> 01:14:23,506
- You didn't eat? - No.

1546
01:14:23,506 --> 01:14:24,907
- Did you eat just now? - Yes.

1547
01:14:24,907 --> 01:14:25,947
- Yes. We just finished dinner. - Oh, no.

1548
01:14:25,947 --> 01:14:27,377
We were about to go to a café.

1549
01:14:27,476 --> 01:14:29,686
I came back, expecting we would eat together.

1550
01:14:30,317 --> 01:14:33,117
But they finished dinner already.

1551
01:14:33,256 --> 01:14:35,317
I thought Se Seung would be home,

1552
01:14:35,657 --> 01:14:37,856
so we would eat together.

1553
01:14:38,327 --> 01:14:41,157
So it was a little...

1554
01:14:42,027 --> 01:14:43,096
upsetting.

1555
01:14:43,266 --> 01:14:45,966
To be honest, I was a little disappointed.

1556
01:14:46,167 --> 01:14:47,197
"Disappointed?"

1557
01:14:47,596 --> 01:14:49,306
I was upset.

1558
01:14:49,667 --> 01:14:51,237
- You ate very early. - Yes.

1559
01:14:51,936 --> 01:14:53,337
- We were hungry. - Yes.

1560
01:14:54,277 --> 01:14:55,436
- You were? - Yes.

1561
01:14:55,436 --> 01:14:56,577
It's a little...

1562
01:14:56,907 --> 01:14:58,006
I got wine.

1563
01:14:58,006 --> 01:14:59,577
- White wine made from muscat. - You bought wine?

1564
01:14:59,577 --> 01:15:00,577
Yes.

1565
01:15:00,577 --> 01:15:02,747
It's perfect. Yong Woo said...

1566
01:15:02,747 --> 01:15:05,447
he would make a nice side dish for alcohol today.

1567
01:15:05,917 --> 01:15:07,987
- Shall we eat together at night? - Yes.

1568
01:15:08,356 --> 01:15:09,386
- Great. - Yes.

1569
01:15:10,027 --> 01:15:13,356
I just wanted to have wine with the people in the house.

1570
01:15:13,596 --> 01:15:15,796
And there's a kind of wine I like.

1571
01:15:16,096 --> 01:15:18,027
So I wanted to share it with them.

1572
01:15:18,426 --> 01:15:19,966
I'm back.

1573
01:15:19,966 --> 01:15:21,796
- Who is it? - Welcome back.

1574
01:15:22,737 --> 01:15:24,837
- Hello. - Have you eaten, Ju Yeon?

1575
01:15:25,367 --> 01:15:27,106
I'm starving.

1576
01:15:27,306 --> 01:15:28,506
You can eat together then.

1577
01:15:28,506 --> 01:15:31,346
That'd be better.

1578
01:15:31,707 --> 01:15:33,817
Ju Yeon happened to come back at that moment.

1579
01:15:33,976 --> 01:15:35,917
"You guys can eat together then."

1580
01:15:36,447 --> 01:15:37,587
I came out quickly after saying that.

1581
01:15:39,516 --> 01:15:41,756
I hope they date.

1582
01:15:42,056 --> 01:15:45,926
She's very calm and considerate.

1583
01:15:46,056 --> 01:15:49,157
She's also humorous and tasteful.

1584
01:15:49,426 --> 01:15:51,096
That's why I like her a lot.

1585
01:15:51,497 --> 01:15:56,006
I can feel that Ju Yeon wants to tease my brother.

1586
01:15:56,167 --> 01:15:58,806
It seemed they got along well.

1587
01:15:59,537 --> 01:16:00,806
- She wants them to date. - She wants them to be together.

1588
01:16:00,806 --> 01:16:01,806
She did it on purpose.

1589
01:16:01,806 --> 01:16:04,777
- His sibling started meddling in. - Yes.

1590
01:16:04,907 --> 01:16:08,346
They would want their siblings to date people they like too.

1591
01:16:08,346 --> 01:16:10,146
- Hoping that it works. - Yes. Hoping that it works.

1592
01:16:11,046 --> 01:16:12,646
- Ju Yeon. - Yes.

1593
01:16:12,886 --> 01:16:15,516
We have pork. I'm going to grill it.

1594
01:16:15,516 --> 01:16:17,256
Okay. I'll go down quickly. Let's cook it together.

1595
01:16:17,256 --> 01:16:18,527
No. Take your time.

1596
01:16:36,207 --> 01:16:38,646
(They will have pork belly and pork neck today.)

1597
01:16:39,106 --> 01:16:42,346
(He grills kimchi as well.)

1598
01:16:49,216 --> 01:16:52,327
I think you and I finish work around the same time.

1599
01:16:52,487 --> 01:16:53,827
Yes. We came back at around the same time.

1600
01:16:53,827 --> 01:16:55,226
I also came back not long ago.

1601
01:16:58,796 --> 01:16:59,796
It looks good.

1602
01:16:59,796 --> 01:17:01,837
You cook quickly.

1603
01:17:04,737 --> 01:17:07,777
(Their simple meal is completed.)

1604
01:17:09,237 --> 01:17:10,947
- Thank you for the food. - I'll enjoy the food.

1605
01:17:11,146 --> 01:17:12,346
Enjoy the food.

1606
01:17:18,787 --> 01:17:22,216
After I got home, I got changed quickly to go down.

1607
01:17:22,216 --> 01:17:25,256
Jae Hyung grilled pork neck and kimchi,

1608
01:17:25,386 --> 01:17:27,657
which was so good.

1609
01:17:27,896 --> 01:17:31,226
I thought it'd be very nice to date someone like him.

1610
01:17:31,327 --> 01:17:35,136
After work, we could have a simple meal at home.

1611
01:17:35,596 --> 01:17:38,436
I think I started to have a crush on him after that.

1612
01:17:39,337 --> 01:17:40,676
Is she imagining her marriage with him?

1613
01:17:41,377 --> 01:17:44,846
Do women often imagine that too?

1614
01:17:44,947 --> 01:17:46,546
I do it all the time.

1615
01:17:47,016 --> 01:17:48,046
- You imagine it? - Yes.

1616
01:17:48,046 --> 01:17:49,077
- Do you always imagine it? - Even before you go out with her?

1617
01:17:49,077 --> 01:17:50,686
- Yes. - You got married in your head...

1618
01:17:50,686 --> 01:17:52,817
- already then? - Yes. "Jonathan, you're so funny."

1619
01:17:52,817 --> 01:17:54,756
That one touch makes me imagine our honeymoon.

1620
01:17:56,657 --> 01:17:58,926
- Oh, my gosh. - My gosh.

1621
01:17:59,827 --> 01:18:00,896
It can happen.

1622
01:18:00,896 --> 01:18:02,056
You imagine your marriage with her.

1623
01:18:02,056 --> 01:18:03,327
- That's interesting. - I even imagine our marriage.

1624
01:18:03,426 --> 01:18:05,367
It doesn't cost money to imagine.

1625
01:18:05,367 --> 01:18:07,037
It's free.

1626
01:18:07,037 --> 01:18:09,136
- Yes. It's free. - Right. So I do that a lot.

1627
01:18:09,667 --> 01:18:10,707
Gosh. It smells like meat.

1628
01:18:10,707 --> 01:18:11,936
(The people who went grocery shopping are back.)

1629
01:18:12,306 --> 01:18:13,606
There's a strong smell of meat.

1630
01:18:15,907 --> 01:18:17,506
(Yong Woo, Yun Ha, and Se Seung came back.)

1631
01:18:17,506 --> 01:18:19,247
- Home sweet home. - Home sweet home.

1632
01:18:22,987 --> 01:18:25,346
Who is singing so wildly?

1633
01:18:26,657 --> 01:18:28,516
- Who is it? - Someone is singing.

1634
01:18:31,457 --> 01:18:34,256
(He's singing after eating meat.)

1635
01:18:34,426 --> 01:18:36,327
Did he drink today?

1636
01:18:39,426 --> 01:18:41,266
My present

1637
01:18:42,266 --> 01:18:43,537
What? When did you come home?

1638
01:18:43,537 --> 01:18:45,266
(Cold)

1639
01:18:45,936 --> 01:18:46,936
A long time ago.

1640
01:18:46,936 --> 01:18:49,277
- We called, but no one came out. - You were having a concert there.

1641
01:18:49,277 --> 01:18:50,377
(Frozen)

1642
01:18:50,377 --> 01:18:51,877
You were singing, weren't you?

1643
01:19:05,287 --> 01:19:07,157
- Are you tired a lot? - Yes.

1644
01:19:10,096 --> 01:19:11,127
Eat this.

1645
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:13,136
What's that?

1646
01:19:13,466 --> 01:19:15,296
Chocolate. Ferrero Rocher.

1647
01:19:15,567 --> 01:19:16,707
I know it's chocolate.

1648
01:19:18,636 --> 01:19:20,777
It's a lot of chocolate for one person.

1649
01:19:21,707 --> 01:19:23,777
Share it with everyone. I want to eat it too.

1650
01:19:27,216 --> 01:19:28,417
I'll put it downstairs.

1651
01:19:29,176 --> 01:19:30,617
Take a rest. Are you okay?

1652
01:19:30,617 --> 01:19:31,617
Yes.

1653
01:19:46,296 --> 01:19:49,436
I looked around the area today because I liked the atmosphere.

1654
01:19:49,737 --> 01:19:51,567
Do you want to go out and drink in the evening someday?

1655
01:19:52,106 --> 01:19:53,176
- It sounds good. - It sounds good.

1656
01:19:53,176 --> 01:19:54,377
Tomorrow is Friday. Perfect.

1657
01:19:54,636 --> 01:19:55,737
- Is it? - How about a glass of makgeolli?

1658
01:19:55,737 --> 01:19:56,747
It sounds amazing.

1659
01:19:56,976 --> 01:19:57,976
Great.

1660
01:19:58,407 --> 01:19:59,407
- Cheers. - Cheers.

1661
01:19:59,407 --> 01:20:00,417
(The guys secretly made an appointment.)

1662
01:20:03,646 --> 01:20:05,587
Is it that thing?

1663
01:20:06,117 --> 01:20:07,256
The trump card?

1664
01:20:07,556 --> 01:20:09,556
- It's... - It's not something amazing.

1665
01:20:09,926 --> 01:20:10,957
The trump...

1666
01:20:12,157 --> 01:20:13,197
card.

1667
01:20:13,596 --> 01:20:15,457
It's a kind of dessert...

1668
01:20:15,457 --> 01:20:17,167
I've been trying these days.

1669
01:20:17,367 --> 01:20:19,667
- It's a dessert? - It's not something amazing.

1670
01:20:19,667 --> 01:20:20,796
- What kind of dessert is it? - If we...

1671
01:20:21,197 --> 01:20:24,207
have a chance later, let's eat it.

1672
01:20:24,806 --> 01:20:28,337
I ordered a special truffle sauce for you guys.

1673
01:20:28,476 --> 01:20:29,606
- You did? - Yes.

1674
01:20:29,777 --> 01:20:31,606
I'll make a dessert for you.

1675
01:20:31,777 --> 01:20:32,777
It sounds great.

1676
01:20:32,777 --> 01:20:34,617
(What kind of sauce is it?)

1677
01:20:34,817 --> 01:20:38,947
Compared to its low price, it's very rich in taste.

1678
01:20:39,046 --> 01:20:41,787
It's a very nice spray.

1679
01:20:45,756 --> 01:20:46,756
Is it this one?

1680
01:20:47,327 --> 01:20:48,327
- The basic one. - The basic one.

1681
01:20:48,756 --> 01:20:49,966
One would be enough.

1682
01:20:50,266 --> 01:20:52,466
I hope you don't fight for it.

1683
01:20:52,966 --> 01:20:55,697
Yong Woo said he would make a side dish for alcohol.

1684
01:20:55,867 --> 01:20:58,867
I think he would be able to make something fancy.

1685
01:20:59,136 --> 01:21:00,136
I'm looking forward to it.

1686
01:21:00,136 --> 01:21:02,436
(Even when he's not around, they are looking forward to the dish.)

1687
01:21:02,436 --> 01:21:05,207
(Yong Woo's ultimate dessert is coming soon.)

1688
01:21:09,846 --> 01:21:11,846
Would you like to drink a little?

1689
01:21:17,587 --> 01:21:20,396
(He sprinkles herb salt on the ice cream.)

1690
01:21:20,926 --> 01:21:24,027
(He sprays something amazing.)

1691
01:21:24,926 --> 01:21:27,037
(He grinds pepper over it.)

1692
01:21:27,766 --> 01:21:30,106
(He keeps it in the freezer so that it doesn't melt.)

1693
01:21:30,106 --> 01:21:31,537
Can you tell everyone to come?

1694
01:21:31,537 --> 01:21:32,567
Sure.

1695
01:21:32,837 --> 01:21:34,606
- Oh, my gosh. - Gosh.

1696
01:21:35,277 --> 01:21:37,447
- It's Riesling, but it's sparkling. - It's...

1697
01:21:37,846 --> 01:21:39,176
It tastes so fresh.

1698
01:21:39,346 --> 01:21:41,476
Try this with it.

1699
01:21:42,346 --> 01:21:43,787
- Oh, my. - What's this?

1700
01:21:44,186 --> 01:21:46,216
It'd pair well with this wine.

1701
01:21:46,216 --> 01:21:47,216
- I know. - I know.

1702
01:21:47,216 --> 01:21:49,117
He got white wine today, which is perfect.

1703
01:21:49,117 --> 01:21:51,056
Do you guys have telepathy?

1704
01:21:51,056 --> 01:21:53,296
- I heard it in the afternoon. - Right?

1705
01:21:53,296 --> 01:21:54,856
- It tingled. - Yes.

1706
01:21:54,856 --> 01:21:55,957
It tingled.

1707
01:21:55,957 --> 01:21:59,426
- I'll enjoy it. - I'll enjoy it.

1708
01:22:00,067 --> 01:22:02,096
- Cheers. - Cheers.

1709
01:22:02,096 --> 01:22:03,136
- It's so good to see you. - This is great.

1710
01:22:06,237 --> 01:22:07,436
The wine is amazing.

1711
01:22:07,777 --> 01:22:09,136
- It's really good. - Try this.

1712
01:22:11,676 --> 01:22:12,747
How is it?

1713
01:22:14,317 --> 01:22:15,577
This is so good.

1714
01:22:16,277 --> 01:22:18,686
It's interesting with the pepper.

1715
01:22:18,686 --> 01:22:20,317
- It enhances the flavour, right? - Yes.

1716
01:22:20,617 --> 01:22:21,686
It's really good.

1717
01:22:22,957 --> 01:22:24,226
- Yun Ha. - Yes.

1718
01:22:24,356 --> 01:22:27,756
- You like self-help books... - Yes.

1719
01:22:27,756 --> 01:22:29,867
as far as I remember.

1720
01:22:30,197 --> 01:22:32,367
Se Seung likes essays.

1721
01:22:32,827 --> 01:22:35,796
Ju Yeon likes essays too.

1722
01:22:35,796 --> 01:22:38,037
- Yes. I'm not a big fan of novels. - Right.

1723
01:22:39,037 --> 01:22:40,237
That's what I remember.

1724
01:22:42,106 --> 01:22:45,346
Speaking of which, I bought books.

1725
01:22:45,846 --> 01:22:46,846
What?

1726
01:22:46,846 --> 01:22:48,747
- It's... - You're an unpredictable guy.

1727
01:22:48,747 --> 01:22:49,987
It's so...

1728
01:22:49,987 --> 01:22:51,417
- Are you going to give them books? - Is it a gift?

1729
01:22:51,716 --> 01:22:54,256
- Yes. - Oh, my gosh.

1730
01:22:54,256 --> 01:22:55,417
- That's so cool. - It's crazy.

1731
01:22:56,386 --> 01:22:57,487
This is amazing.

1732
01:22:58,027 --> 01:22:59,856
- I'm touched. - I...

1733
01:23:00,027 --> 01:23:01,327
- This is incredible. - called them.

1734
01:23:02,497 --> 01:23:03,867
He's giving them books.

1735
01:23:03,966 --> 01:23:05,426
That's a great gift.

1736
01:23:05,596 --> 01:23:06,997
He got different books for each.

1737
01:23:06,997 --> 01:23:08,737
He picked the book, thinking about the person.

1738
01:23:08,867 --> 01:23:11,407
This is for you, Ju Yeon.

1739
01:23:12,436 --> 01:23:13,877
He went to a bookstore...

1740
01:23:14,106 --> 01:23:17,146
and picked a book I might like.

1741
01:23:17,146 --> 01:23:18,947
I was very thankful.

1742
01:23:19,247 --> 01:23:20,617
He's so tasteful,

1743
01:23:21,247 --> 01:23:24,216
which is unexpected.

1744
01:23:24,947 --> 01:23:27,186
This is a book that changed me.

1745
01:23:27,186 --> 01:23:29,287
- It's a self-help book. - Is it? My gosh.

1746
01:23:29,287 --> 01:23:30,926
This is for you, Se Seung.

1747
01:23:30,926 --> 01:23:32,686
- Thank you. - Please read it.

1748
01:23:34,827 --> 01:23:37,167
I was very touched.

1749
01:23:40,197 --> 01:23:41,497
(The meeting of 2 people is the meeting of 2 worlds.)

1750
01:23:41,497 --> 01:23:42,796
(That's why I hope to meet people with big worlds.)

1751
01:23:42,796 --> 01:23:44,167
(So that there are many places I can look into.)

1752
01:23:48,037 --> 01:23:49,077
Cho A?

1753
01:23:49,806 --> 01:23:50,806
Cho A?

1754
01:23:52,106 --> 01:23:53,417
I'm back.

1755
01:23:53,417 --> 01:23:55,346
- Oh, my. - Gosh.

1756
01:23:56,046 --> 01:23:57,046
- I'm happy that she's back. - I'm happy that she's back.

1757
01:23:57,046 --> 01:23:58,587
- You're that happy to see me again? - It was a good one.

1758
01:23:59,546 --> 01:24:00,787
It's been a while.

1759
01:24:00,787 --> 01:24:02,317
- You worked hard. - Hurry up and join us.

1760
01:24:02,457 --> 01:24:04,226
- I'm back. - Hurry up and join us.

1761
01:24:04,487 --> 01:24:08,596
It was the first time I've had so many people happy to see me.

1762
01:24:08,756 --> 01:24:12,327
It's a real shame that I can't spend much time with them.

1763
01:24:12,567 --> 01:24:16,197
But at the same time, that's what makes it more special.

1764
01:24:16,266 --> 01:24:17,337
- Really? - Yes.

1765
01:24:17,337 --> 01:24:19,037
- Have you eaten? - Have you eaten?

1766
01:24:19,337 --> 01:24:20,476
Have you eaten?

1767
01:24:20,577 --> 01:24:21,877
I had dinner today.

1768
01:24:21,877 --> 01:24:22,936
I'm glad to hear that.

1769
01:24:24,377 --> 01:24:25,707
Would you like to drink wine too?

1770
01:24:25,707 --> 01:24:26,817
Yes. Sounds good.

1771
01:24:27,476 --> 01:24:29,317
Should I give you the remaining ice cream then?

1772
01:24:30,216 --> 01:24:31,747
- The ice cream? - We still got some.

1773
01:24:31,747 --> 01:24:32,817
- What did you guys eat? - It was amazing.

1774
01:24:32,817 --> 01:24:34,417
Try this.

1775
01:24:34,516 --> 01:24:37,726
We had the steak Yong Woo cooked earlier.

1776
01:24:37,726 --> 01:24:39,186
It was really good.

1777
01:24:39,896 --> 01:24:41,497
- Let me give you this. - What's this?

1778
01:24:41,497 --> 01:24:42,796
- It's... - Are you making it yourself?

1779
01:24:42,796 --> 01:24:43,997
Yes. Try it.

1780
01:24:46,936 --> 01:24:49,396
- It must've been tough to work. - No, I'm fine.

1781
01:24:50,837 --> 01:24:52,106
Would you like some chocolate?

1782
01:24:59,976 --> 01:25:00,976
Really?

1783
01:25:01,846 --> 01:25:03,447
- Really? - Here.

1784
01:25:03,747 --> 01:25:04,817
Thank you.

1785
01:25:05,516 --> 01:25:06,856
It looks good.

1786
01:25:07,957 --> 01:25:10,027
- Why are you so busy? - Yes.

1787
01:25:10,027 --> 01:25:12,027
Is it okay?

1788
01:25:12,327 --> 01:25:13,726
Are you okay with something as sweet as this?

1789
01:25:14,457 --> 01:25:15,697
- Yes, I like it. - You do?

1790
01:25:15,697 --> 01:25:16,926
- Yes. I like chocolate. - Eat.

1791
01:25:19,466 --> 01:25:20,466
It's...

1792
01:25:21,867 --> 01:25:22,936
I washed it just now.

1793
01:25:22,936 --> 01:25:24,436
- Okay. Thank you. - You can eat with it.

1794
01:25:27,037 --> 01:25:28,136
Do you like chips?

1795
01:25:32,006 --> 01:25:34,947
You're preparing a meal for me.

1796
01:25:35,747 --> 01:25:36,787
Thank you.

1797
01:25:38,287 --> 01:25:40,157
- Did you have dinner? - Yes, I did.

1798
01:25:40,157 --> 01:25:42,386
- You did? - But I ate a little early.

1799
01:25:42,386 --> 01:25:43,386
That's good.

1800
01:25:44,157 --> 01:25:45,987
Shall we make a toast since Cho A is back?

1801
01:25:45,987 --> 01:25:46,997
- All right. - For Cho A.

1802
01:25:46,997 --> 01:25:48,256
- Cheers. - Cheers.

1803
01:25:48,256 --> 01:25:50,096
- You guys worked hard. - For Cho A.

1804
01:25:50,096 --> 01:25:51,167
You guys worked hard.

1805
01:25:54,167 --> 01:25:55,567
Something is suspicious.

1806
01:25:55,667 --> 01:25:57,037
The air here is...

1807
01:25:57,037 --> 01:26:00,707
I know. It's warm, but it makes you feel uncomfortable.

1808
01:26:00,707 --> 01:26:02,476
I have a question. Jung Sub...

1809
01:26:02,476 --> 01:26:05,377
might have feelings for Cho A.

1810
01:26:05,377 --> 01:26:07,146
He would because they haven't talked much yet.

1811
01:26:07,146 --> 01:26:10,917
Cho A must look mysterious among the girls.

1812
01:26:10,917 --> 01:26:12,987
- She doesn't stay at home much. - Right.

1813
01:26:12,987 --> 01:26:14,587
- Right. - They didn't have a chance...

1814
01:26:14,587 --> 01:26:16,587
to have deep talks with her.

1815
01:26:16,587 --> 01:26:18,256
- It's been only a few days too. - Yes.

1816
01:26:18,256 --> 01:26:19,356
- True. - They moved in not long ago.

1817
01:26:19,726 --> 01:26:21,556
- If it's more than two... - Right.

1818
01:26:22,497 --> 01:26:23,596
Let me go.

1819
01:26:24,067 --> 01:26:25,997
- I really wanted to go. - What is it?

1820
01:26:25,997 --> 01:26:27,636
- Did you order pizza? - Did you order pizza?

1821
01:26:27,636 --> 01:26:28,737
Who ordered pizza?

1822
01:26:29,237 --> 01:26:31,266
(A letter has arrived.)

1823
01:26:39,346 --> 01:26:41,146
It's been a long time since I saw the pink envelope.

1824
01:26:41,277 --> 01:26:42,447
We got the card.

1825
01:26:43,646 --> 01:26:44,646
Okay.

1826
01:26:44,646 --> 01:26:46,216
"There's a photo album..."

1827
01:26:46,216 --> 01:26:48,417
"on the bookshelf in the basement."

1828
01:26:48,417 --> 01:26:49,417
What?

1829
01:26:50,457 --> 01:26:51,457
An album.

1830
01:26:53,926 --> 01:26:56,327
"Sit down on the sofa on the first floor..."

1831
01:26:56,556 --> 01:26:58,127
"to have a look together."

1832
01:27:00,197 --> 01:27:01,737
- Let's go. - Shall we go?

1833
01:27:02,796 --> 01:27:03,806
An album?

1834
01:27:03,806 --> 01:27:04,966
- Should we go down? - It's a photo album.

1835
01:27:06,136 --> 01:27:07,176
I want to go too.

1836
01:27:08,606 --> 01:27:09,606
A bookshelf?

1837
01:27:14,146 --> 01:27:15,346
Is it here?

1838
01:27:17,447 --> 01:27:18,716
- It's here. - It's here.

1839
01:27:25,426 --> 01:27:27,596
- Numbers 1 and 2. - It's so big.

1840
01:27:27,596 --> 01:27:28,756
- Please hold number two. - Sure.

1841
01:27:28,756 --> 01:27:29,796
Number one is...

1842
01:27:30,827 --> 01:27:32,396
- Gosh, what's going on? - It's this one.

1843
01:27:33,127 --> 01:27:34,936
It's really big. It's a lot bigger than I thought.

1844
01:27:35,037 --> 01:27:36,396
Would there be our childhood pictures?

1845
01:27:36,396 --> 01:27:38,407
- I think that'd be the case. - Yes.

1846
01:27:39,936 --> 01:27:41,407
Shall we sit close?

1847
01:27:41,407 --> 01:27:42,537
"Sit close?"

1848
01:27:42,636 --> 01:27:44,976
What would it be? It's driving me crazy.

1849
01:27:45,146 --> 01:27:46,447
I want to see and don't want to see at the same time.

1850
01:27:47,016 --> 01:27:49,377
- Are they our childhood pictures? - I want to see it so badly.

1851
01:27:50,447 --> 01:27:51,546
Shall we open it?

1852
01:27:52,247 --> 01:27:53,346
It's...

1853
01:27:54,556 --> 01:27:58,256
"This album has pictures of you growing up."

1854
01:27:58,426 --> 01:28:00,027
"Please flip through them 1 by 1 together."

1855
01:28:00,856 --> 01:28:02,697
- Shall we take turns to flip it? - It sounds good.

1856
01:28:02,697 --> 01:28:03,997
- This is crazy. - Shall we?

1857
01:28:03,997 --> 01:28:05,627
- You do it first, Yong Woo. - Okay.

1858
01:28:06,226 --> 01:28:07,337
Let's go in this order.

1859
01:28:07,497 --> 01:28:08,596
- Okay. - Who is it?

1860
01:28:08,596 --> 01:28:10,207
- Who is it? - Who is this?

1861
01:28:10,407 --> 01:28:13,837
(Who is in the first picture?)

1862
01:28:15,377 --> 01:28:18,407
(Extraordinary shoulders)

1863
01:28:23,317 --> 01:28:25,747
(Are they seeing someone?)

1864
01:28:26,186 --> 01:28:27,356
I think it's Yong Woo.

1865
01:28:29,386 --> 01:28:31,027
- It's Yong Woo. - It's Yong Woo.

1866
01:28:31,027 --> 01:28:32,527
- It's Yong Woo. - Is it Yong Woo?

1867
01:28:32,527 --> 01:28:34,127
- He looks excited. - It's upside down for me, so...

1868
01:28:34,127 --> 01:28:35,327
- It's Yong Woo. - Yes.

1869
01:28:35,327 --> 01:28:37,596
(Yong Woo when he was 100 days old)

1870
01:28:37,596 --> 01:28:40,497
As soon as I saw the picture, I was like, "Here it comes."

1871
01:28:40,796 --> 01:28:42,667
"I should get it together."

1872
01:28:43,667 --> 01:28:45,466
- He looks cute. - Oh, it's me.

1873
01:28:45,466 --> 01:28:47,936
- I can recognize his face now. - Yes. It's me.

1874
01:28:47,936 --> 01:28:49,006
Right.

1875
01:28:49,006 --> 01:28:50,506
- Right. - He was energetic back then too.

1876
01:28:50,506 --> 01:28:51,947
(Little Young Woo was very energetic.)

1877
01:28:51,947 --> 01:28:53,546
- It's cute. - It's cute.

1878
01:28:54,317 --> 01:28:56,577
- It's definitely Yong Woo. - I can tell immediately.

1879
01:28:56,577 --> 01:28:58,016
- It's obvious. - All of a sudden...

1880
01:28:58,016 --> 01:28:59,447
You received good grades.

1881
01:29:01,016 --> 01:29:02,657
- What? - Look.

1882
01:29:02,657 --> 01:29:03,756
- You were very handsome. - Very handsome.

1883
01:29:03,756 --> 01:29:05,587
- You were handsome. - Gosh.

1884
01:29:05,587 --> 01:29:06,796
It was not long after I entered college.

1885
01:29:06,796 --> 01:29:08,457
- Really? You look so young here. - I became a college student.

1886
01:29:08,457 --> 01:29:10,127
- You were a college student here? - You were a college student here?

1887
01:29:10,127 --> 01:29:11,867
You were cute.

1888
01:29:11,867 --> 01:29:12,966
You suddenly became handsome.

1889
01:29:13,096 --> 01:29:14,266
You look handsome here.

1890
01:29:17,506 --> 01:29:18,537
- What? - I see.

1891
01:29:18,867 --> 01:29:20,476
- For real? - What's this?

1892
01:29:21,106 --> 01:29:22,636
What's this?

1893
01:29:22,936 --> 01:29:24,247
This is...

1894
01:29:24,247 --> 01:29:26,106
- It's so cool. - Hurry up.

1895
01:29:26,106 --> 01:29:31,046
(Yong Woo in his 20s standing in front of a light aircraft)

1896
01:29:33,247 --> 01:29:34,516
- What is it? - For real?

1897
01:29:34,516 --> 01:29:35,516
Is he a pilot?

1898
01:29:35,516 --> 01:29:36,587
- Seriously? - Is he a pilot?

1899
01:29:36,856 --> 01:29:38,027
- A pilot? - Is he a pilot?

1900
01:29:38,027 --> 01:29:39,186
- He's a pilot? - Really?

1901
01:29:39,186 --> 01:29:41,657
- Or... - Or it's a job experience program.

1902
01:29:42,497 --> 01:29:44,327
- Like KidZania? - He might've gone to a center.

1903
01:29:44,327 --> 01:29:46,396
- Yes. He might've gone there. - A job experience program.

1904
01:29:46,396 --> 01:29:47,766
I've done it too.

1905
01:29:47,766 --> 01:29:48,966
- What is it? - Is it just a picture of him...

1906
01:29:48,966 --> 01:29:50,337
- when he was in his 20s? - Is it a costume play?

1907
01:29:50,337 --> 01:29:51,466
- It's a picture of him... - It might be...

1908
01:29:51,466 --> 01:29:52,466
- when he was in his 20s. - an edited picture.

1909
01:29:52,466 --> 01:29:53,606
- Or was he in the Air Force? - I think you're right.

1910
01:29:53,606 --> 01:29:54,936
- Or... - Seriously?

1911
01:30:00,317 --> 01:30:02,417
- You can't hide it. - His face is red.

1912
01:30:02,417 --> 01:30:03,646
You can't hide it now.

1913
01:30:04,247 --> 01:30:05,346
- Gosh. - Oh, my gosh.

1914
01:30:05,346 --> 01:30:06,487
- What is it? - Really?

1915
01:30:06,487 --> 01:30:07,856
Is this it?

1916
01:30:08,587 --> 01:30:09,716
It's unbelievable.

1917
01:30:09,716 --> 01:30:11,556
- It looks real. - For real?

1918
01:30:11,556 --> 01:30:14,226
(Current Yong Woo)

1919
01:30:14,226 --> 01:30:15,457
Doesn't he look...

1920
01:30:15,457 --> 01:30:16,966
- like he got dressed... - Yes.

1921
01:30:16,966 --> 01:30:18,697
- for a costume play? - But...

1922
01:30:18,697 --> 01:30:20,537
Or he could be a model.

1923
01:30:20,697 --> 01:30:21,966
It could be the case.

1924
01:30:21,966 --> 01:30:22,966
- Yes. - Gosh.

1925
01:30:22,966 --> 01:30:24,067
Isn't it a little weird?

1926
01:30:24,067 --> 01:30:25,237
- Doesn't it look awkward? - Yes.

1927
01:30:25,237 --> 01:30:27,806
- The epaulets and stuff. - Yes. It doesn't look real.

1928
01:30:27,976 --> 01:30:31,077
Doesn't the belt look like the one in a car?

1929
01:30:32,407 --> 01:30:34,046
Does aircraft have seatbelts like that?

1930
01:30:34,046 --> 01:30:35,447
Shouldn't they have "X" seatbelts?

1931
01:30:35,447 --> 01:30:36,947
- It's somehow... - Is he a stunt performer?

1932
01:30:36,947 --> 01:30:38,186
- Is he a stunt performer? - What is it?

1933
01:30:38,846 --> 01:30:41,457
Their jobs will be revealed today.

1934
01:30:41,457 --> 01:30:42,716
- Yes. - Cute.

1935
01:30:43,827 --> 01:30:45,657
- Is it edited? - Is it your job?

1936
01:30:45,827 --> 01:30:47,096
- Let's go. - It's so cool.

1937
01:30:47,096 --> 01:30:48,157
- Hurry up. - Really?

1938
01:30:48,157 --> 01:30:50,466
- It suits you. - Did you rent it too?

1939
01:30:50,466 --> 01:30:51,926
- Seriously? What's this? - It's so interesting.

1940
01:30:51,926 --> 01:30:53,697
Is it real or not? Just say it.

1941
01:30:53,697 --> 01:30:54,867
- It's a plot twist. - I think it's real.

1942
01:30:54,867 --> 01:30:56,907
- Seriously? - It's amazing.

1943
01:30:57,867 --> 01:31:00,676
I felt shy at first, looking at my childhood pictures.

1944
01:31:01,436 --> 01:31:04,606
"I was cute when I was little." I was thinking that.

1945
01:31:05,577 --> 01:31:08,546
Then it started to get weird.

1946
01:31:17,426 --> 01:31:20,186
(From when he was 100 days old until now,)

1947
01:31:20,186 --> 01:31:24,896
(his life was captured in several photos.)

1948
01:31:24,896 --> 01:31:27,497
I had weird feelings.

1949
01:31:28,567 --> 01:31:30,506
On the last page,

1950
01:31:30,936 --> 01:31:32,337
I think there was a letter.

1951
01:31:32,506 --> 01:31:34,636
- I wanted to check. - You're so sharp.

1952
01:31:34,636 --> 01:31:36,337
"The person in this picture..."

1953
01:31:36,337 --> 01:31:37,407
- "will open the envelope..." - The person in this picture.

1954
01:31:37,407 --> 01:31:40,577
"and read the introduction written by his or her sibling."

1955
01:31:41,277 --> 01:31:42,417
Oh, my gosh. This is so much fun.

1956
01:31:42,417 --> 01:31:43,787
- But we... - This is...

1957
01:31:43,787 --> 01:31:44,987
My goodness.

1958
01:31:44,987 --> 01:31:46,087
This must be the D-day.

1959
01:31:46,087 --> 01:31:47,216
- Please read it. - This is insane.

1960
01:31:47,216 --> 01:31:48,787
Who's going to read?

1961
01:31:49,957 --> 01:31:56,127
(On the last page, there's a letter written by the sibling.)

1962
01:31:56,657 --> 01:31:58,167
I will read it.

1963
01:31:58,396 --> 01:31:59,997
- Look at that. - And it's long.

1964
01:31:59,997 --> 01:32:01,037
- Really? - You're right.

1965
01:32:01,037 --> 01:32:02,266
(The introduction on the sibling is very long.)

1966
01:32:04,306 --> 01:32:05,667
"When Yong Woo was young..."

1967
01:32:06,306 --> 01:32:08,037
- Wait a minute. - Already?

1968
01:32:08,337 --> 01:32:10,506
- Go on. - Can I cry?

1969
01:32:12,606 --> 01:32:15,247
"When Yong Woo was young, he liked to read."

1970
01:32:15,617 --> 01:32:18,346
"Even when he was struggling,"

1971
01:32:18,346 --> 01:32:20,117
"he read to comfort himself."

1972
01:32:21,716 --> 01:32:22,716
Oh, my gosh.

1973
01:32:23,117 --> 01:32:24,127
- Oh, my. - Gosh.

1974
01:32:36,867 --> 01:32:38,837
- What's going on? - What's that look?

1975
01:32:38,837 --> 01:32:41,176
- What? - Why am I crying?

1976
01:32:41,176 --> 01:32:42,737
Me too.

1977
01:32:46,577 --> 01:32:48,516
- Read it slowly. - Take your time.

1978
01:32:48,516 --> 01:32:49,747
- It's not as easy as I thought. - No.

1979
01:32:52,117 --> 01:32:55,756
The moment I read "Yong Woo..."

1980
01:32:56,317 --> 01:32:59,186
I never called myself in the third person point of view.

1981
01:32:59,287 --> 01:33:02,296
I don't think I ever asked anyone...

1982
01:33:02,997 --> 01:33:05,266
about what I was like.

1983
01:33:05,266 --> 01:33:06,966
That's not who I am.

1984
01:33:07,396 --> 01:33:09,367
It felt like someone was talking about me,

1985
01:33:09,367 --> 01:33:11,136
and I didn't expect that.

1986
01:33:12,037 --> 01:33:13,207
I'm not sure,

1987
01:33:13,537 --> 01:33:17,247
but I suddenly became emotional when I read it.

1988
01:33:21,346 --> 01:33:23,716
"I think that's when he learned to stay calm..."

1989
01:33:23,716 --> 01:33:27,386
"and maintain a positive attitude."

1990
01:33:30,087 --> 01:33:32,256
What's wrong with me? This is no big deal.

1991
01:33:32,886 --> 01:33:34,157
I'm suddenly malfunctioning.

1992
01:33:34,157 --> 01:33:36,726
- It's okay. - I feel like crying.

1993
01:33:51,606 --> 01:33:54,617
"He's sweet and never loses his sense of humour at all times."

1994
01:33:56,377 --> 01:33:59,817
"He has the charm..."

1995
01:34:00,756 --> 01:34:01,856
"of making others happy."

1996
01:34:07,256 --> 01:34:10,027
That's one heartfelt letter.

1997
01:34:11,167 --> 01:34:12,396
I went back to that time.

1998
01:34:13,627 --> 01:34:15,497
It brought me back to that time.

1999
01:34:15,596 --> 01:34:18,537
The feelings I had at the time...

2000
01:34:18,537 --> 01:34:21,207
were saved somewhere,

2001
01:34:21,306 --> 01:34:22,737
and they were all brought back.

2002
01:34:25,377 --> 01:34:28,216
He tries to stay calm at all times.

2003
01:34:28,577 --> 01:34:31,146
He hates being emotional.

2004
01:34:31,146 --> 01:34:32,487
He keeps telling himself...

2005
01:34:32,487 --> 01:34:35,617
that he is rational.

2006
01:34:36,487 --> 01:34:38,527
That's what I thought.

2007
01:34:39,087 --> 01:34:42,896
But a man can't always be rational.

2008
01:34:43,896 --> 01:34:46,896
He probably underwent trial and error...

2009
01:34:46,896 --> 01:34:48,396
until he became calm.

2010
01:34:49,367 --> 01:34:52,707
By reading books...

2011
01:34:53,067 --> 01:34:55,737
He probably made a lot of effort.

2012
01:34:56,337 --> 01:34:59,476
Today is Lee Yong Woo's birthday...

2013
01:34:59,476 --> 01:35:02,216
- in 2002. - Now that I think about it,

2014
01:35:02,317 --> 01:35:03,917
he barely talked at home when he went through adolescence.

2015
01:35:03,917 --> 01:35:06,287
Guys, look here.

2016
01:35:06,846 --> 01:35:09,516
He wouldn't talk until I crashed at his room.

2017
01:35:09,686 --> 01:35:11,587
- It's not dirty. - Why do you look at me like that?

2018
01:35:11,686 --> 01:35:14,096
When I watch the videos of him from his childhood,

2019
01:35:14,627 --> 01:35:16,556
he didn't look that happy.

2020
01:35:18,667 --> 01:35:22,096
Happy birthday to you

2021
01:35:22,096 --> 01:35:24,867
I was too young...

2022
01:35:25,537 --> 01:35:27,106
- Look here. - to read the room.

2023
01:35:27,207 --> 01:35:30,207
- I was always cheerful and bright. - Look at me.

2024
01:35:31,377 --> 01:35:33,546
Your eyes got so big.

2025
01:35:33,546 --> 01:35:36,016
Let me see. Why is your brother wandering around...

2026
01:35:36,016 --> 01:35:38,117
instead of celebrating his sister's birthday?

2027
01:35:38,646 --> 01:35:41,587
My parents were very energetic back then,

2028
01:35:41,686 --> 01:35:44,527
and there were things that they couldn't agree on.

2029
01:35:45,056 --> 01:35:47,027
So there were some issues.

2030
01:35:50,567 --> 01:35:53,766
They had a fight as always,

2031
01:35:53,766 --> 01:35:57,067
so I entered my brother's room grunting.

2032
01:35:57,207 --> 01:35:58,537
I was like, "I don't want to hear it anymore."

2033
01:35:58,966 --> 01:36:02,777
Then he told me to read with him.

2034
01:36:02,936 --> 01:36:05,146
He was at his desk,

2035
01:36:05,146 --> 01:36:09,617
and I was reading on his bed.

2036
01:36:09,617 --> 01:36:12,186
I remember reading "The Little Prince..."

2037
01:36:13,046 --> 01:36:14,386
for the first time.

2038
01:36:14,386 --> 01:36:16,756
I'm not sure how old I was.

2039
01:36:16,957 --> 01:36:21,396
(She recalled that memory and wrote the first phrase for Yong Woo.)

2040
01:36:21,396 --> 01:36:24,096
"When Yong Woo was young, he liked to read."

2041
01:36:25,896 --> 01:36:28,466
"Even when he was struggling,"

2042
01:36:28,466 --> 01:36:30,367
"he read to comfort himself."

2043
01:36:33,167 --> 01:36:39,106
(Do you remember reading with Ju Yeon when she was young?)

2044
01:37:13,907 --> 01:37:15,476
Even if something bad happened,

2045
01:37:17,987 --> 01:37:20,146
I pretended to be okay...

2046
01:37:23,056 --> 01:37:26,186
so I could provide Ju Yeon...

2047
01:37:27,657 --> 01:37:31,027
a comfortable environment.

2048
01:37:39,337 --> 01:37:40,537
She was so young.

2049
01:37:47,377 --> 01:37:49,447
She's gotten taller, but she was still immature.

2050
01:37:51,447 --> 01:37:53,716
Things could be roaring,

2051
01:37:53,716 --> 01:37:55,487
so I helped her read calmly...

2052
01:37:55,886 --> 01:37:57,327
and rest next to me.

2053
01:37:59,056 --> 01:38:00,457
So she could find her composure.

2054
01:38:02,226 --> 01:38:05,766
The books were just one of the toys.

2055
01:38:08,737 --> 01:38:11,806
Just staying next to her...

2056
01:38:13,537 --> 01:38:14,676
at the time...

2057
01:38:14,676 --> 01:38:16,877
Happy birthday to you

2058
01:38:16,877 --> 01:38:18,877
Your brother should do it. Do it again.

2059
01:38:18,877 --> 01:38:21,317
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

2060
01:38:21,317 --> 01:38:24,346
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

2061
01:38:24,346 --> 01:38:28,016
- Dear Ju Yeon - Dear Ju Yeon

2062
01:38:28,016 --> 01:38:29,117
Happy birthday to you

2063
01:38:29,117 --> 01:38:31,157
Someone might have needed it.

2064
01:38:35,627 --> 01:38:36,827
So I wanted to give it to her.

2065
01:38:37,697 --> 01:38:39,067
I'm sorry.

2066
01:38:44,367 --> 01:38:49,837
(Young Yong Woo wanted to give what he needed to Ju Yeon.)

2067
01:38:51,877 --> 01:38:56,716
My brother always wants to show...

2068
01:38:56,716 --> 01:38:58,516
how he overcomes everything.

2069
01:38:59,087 --> 01:39:00,886
He wants to overcome himself as well.

2070
01:39:01,587 --> 01:39:03,957
I haven't seen him crying for so long.

2071
01:39:06,226 --> 01:39:09,127
I thought things must've been very tough for him.

2072
01:39:09,127 --> 01:39:11,966
He must've made a lot of effort...

2073
01:39:12,197 --> 01:39:14,667
without anyone knowing.

2074
01:39:21,506 --> 01:39:24,146
Let's go. Ask Mom to film you later.

2075
01:39:27,277 --> 01:39:30,987
Mr. Lee Yong Woo got way taller than his eldest aunt.

2076
01:39:35,356 --> 01:39:38,256
I don't live with my father now,

2077
01:39:38,787 --> 01:39:41,756
but I don't hate him or despise him.

2078
01:39:42,256 --> 01:39:45,466
Even for parents, it's their first time...

2079
01:39:46,266 --> 01:39:48,197
to get married and raise children.

2080
01:39:49,337 --> 01:39:50,567
So it could happen.

2081
01:40:04,917 --> 01:40:07,216
I wanted Ju Yeon to always be bright.

2082
01:40:12,926 --> 01:40:14,426
You've done well.

2083
01:40:15,296 --> 01:40:16,327
Thank you.

2084
01:40:19,197 --> 01:40:21,466
Oh, I had this thought when I was young.

2085
01:40:21,466 --> 01:40:23,396
I was so grateful to him...

2086
01:40:24,306 --> 01:40:26,436
that if we were born again,

2087
01:40:26,436 --> 01:40:29,337
I wanted to be his big sister and treat him nicely.

2088
01:40:29,337 --> 01:40:32,546
I had that thought when I was young.

2089
01:40:33,806 --> 01:40:36,877
If he's crying that much even after growing up,

2090
01:40:36,877 --> 01:40:38,987
- it must've been very tough. - Something must've happened.

2091
01:40:39,417 --> 01:40:40,747
They never do that just because...

2092
01:40:40,747 --> 01:40:42,987
siblings are nine years apart.

2093
01:40:43,157 --> 01:40:44,487
In fact, if one was going through adolescence,

2094
01:40:44,487 --> 01:40:46,087
it would give him a mental breakdown.

2095
01:40:46,087 --> 01:40:48,957
It's impossible to think about protecting his sister.

2096
01:40:48,957 --> 01:40:51,027
It was too much pressure for a young boy.

2097
01:40:51,027 --> 01:40:53,997
Thanks to Yong Woo, Ju Yeon was able to become bright.

2098
01:40:53,997 --> 01:40:54,997
Right.

2099
01:40:54,997 --> 01:40:57,396
That's amazing.

2100
01:41:00,037 --> 01:41:01,837
- Take your time. - Yes.

2101
01:41:01,837 --> 01:41:03,577
- It feels... - Right.

2102
01:41:03,577 --> 01:41:05,046
I didn't see this coming at all.

2103
01:41:10,747 --> 01:41:12,747
"When Yong Woo wants to do something,"

2104
01:41:12,747 --> 01:41:14,287
"he never wastes his time."

2105
01:41:14,686 --> 01:41:16,817
"He plans it meticulously and carries it out."

2106
01:41:16,817 --> 01:41:19,957
"He grew up to be a tenacious man."

2107
01:41:20,386 --> 01:41:21,726
"When he was discharged from the army,"

2108
01:41:22,426 --> 01:41:24,096
"he said he found what he wanted to do."

2109
01:41:24,096 --> 01:41:27,537
"He even went to the US for his dream..."

2110
01:41:27,636 --> 01:41:28,966
"which had nothing to do with his major."

2111
01:41:29,966 --> 01:41:33,407
"He began studying..."

2112
01:41:33,806 --> 01:41:35,606
"and achieved his dream in the end."

2113
01:41:35,707 --> 01:41:37,306
"His tenacious nature..."

2114
01:41:37,306 --> 01:41:40,006
"matches his dream."

2115
01:41:40,006 --> 01:41:42,077
"What do you think Yong Woo does for a living?"

2116
01:41:44,487 --> 01:41:46,747
Yong Woo, what do you do for a living?

2117
01:41:48,317 --> 01:41:49,386
What does he do?

2118
01:41:49,386 --> 01:41:50,587
(What did Yong Woo grow up to be?)

2119
01:41:50,587 --> 01:41:51,587
What does he do?

2120
01:41:52,256 --> 01:41:54,527
Yong Woo, what do you do for a living?

2121
01:41:55,997 --> 01:41:57,096
What does he do?

2122
01:41:57,096 --> 01:41:58,296
(What did Yong Woo grow up to be?)

2123
01:41:58,296 --> 01:42:00,667
- What does he do? - I'm a pilot.

2124
01:42:04,436 --> 01:42:05,837
What? Really?

2125
01:42:05,837 --> 01:42:07,537
- Yong Woo, that is... - That's so cool.

2126
01:42:08,237 --> 01:42:10,877
- No way. - My goodness.

2127
01:42:11,247 --> 01:42:14,747
- What? That's so cool. - That's crazy.

2128
01:42:22,186 --> 01:42:24,356
I found a way to be a pilot in the US,

2129
01:42:24,356 --> 01:42:26,457
so I went to the US after graduating from university.

2130
01:42:26,886 --> 01:42:29,226
(After graduating from university, he went to study abroad...)

2131
01:42:29,327 --> 01:42:31,497
(and became a pilot.)

2132
01:42:32,896 --> 01:42:36,167
I obtained the pilot license in the US.

2133
01:42:36,567 --> 01:42:38,966
There are also Jet Rating...

2134
01:42:38,966 --> 01:42:40,867
and a pilot instructor license.

2135
01:42:40,867 --> 01:42:42,506
I got all the licenses.

2136
01:42:42,777 --> 01:42:44,846
Now I can teach students in the US...

2137
01:42:44,846 --> 01:42:46,806
as a pilot instructor.

2138
01:42:46,806 --> 01:42:49,917
I'm at the stage where I just started.

2139
01:42:50,016 --> 01:42:52,947
I have the Jet Rating and a commercial pilot license...

2140
01:42:52,947 --> 01:42:56,356
which allow me to apply for airlines.

2141
01:43:07,936 --> 01:43:14,877
(Lee Yong Woo, Pilot)

2142
01:43:15,777 --> 01:43:17,037
Who said Kidzania?

2143
01:43:17,037 --> 01:43:19,207
- Someone said he was fake. - Who said Kidzania?

2144
01:43:19,577 --> 01:43:20,907
That's so unexpected.

2145
01:43:21,117 --> 01:43:22,247
- I know. - I never expected it at all.

2146
01:43:22,247 --> 01:43:23,646
- Do you remember the first episode? - I never...

2147
01:43:23,646 --> 01:43:24,686
- expected it. - We thought he was a trainer.

2148
01:43:24,686 --> 01:43:26,117
- Right. - Yes.

2149
01:43:26,117 --> 01:43:28,386
I thought he was a trainer because he kept looking for chicken breast.

2150
01:43:28,386 --> 01:43:30,186
We thought he was an athlete or something.

2151
01:43:30,186 --> 01:43:33,087
- You see, it's unfair. - That's so cool.

2152
01:43:33,186 --> 01:43:36,256
- Yes, he's good-looking and kind. - Well...

2153
01:43:36,256 --> 01:43:37,867
He's the standard example of a real man.

2154
01:43:37,867 --> 01:43:39,167
- Right. The standard example. - Yes.

2155
01:43:39,167 --> 01:43:40,726
I respect his life.

2156
01:43:40,726 --> 01:43:42,766
- Exactly. He's cool. - He's cool.

2157
01:43:42,766 --> 01:43:43,896
That's cool.

2158
01:43:46,237 --> 01:43:47,436
I saw his body.

2159
01:43:47,436 --> 01:43:48,436
- Cool. - It was the best.

2160
01:43:49,537 --> 01:43:50,806
I want to be in his arms.

2161
01:43:52,546 --> 01:43:54,447
- What? - Why not?

2162
01:43:55,516 --> 01:43:57,646
- Do you want to? - I want to.

2163
01:43:58,947 --> 01:44:00,046
"Do you want to?"

2164
01:44:01,117 --> 01:44:02,716
- I wonder who it is. - Who is it?

2165
01:44:02,716 --> 01:44:04,556
- Yong Woo, you should... - Flip the page.

2166
01:44:04,556 --> 01:44:06,457
- I'll flip it. - Go.

2167
01:44:08,226 --> 01:44:10,856
"She can do it on her own..."

2168
01:44:10,856 --> 01:44:12,766
"even without her mom. A month old."

2169
01:44:12,766 --> 01:44:14,296
She's eating alone.

2170
01:44:14,296 --> 01:44:16,667
- Right. - Is it Cheol Hyeon? No?

2171
01:44:16,667 --> 01:44:17,867
I think it's a girl.

2172
01:44:17,867 --> 01:44:19,466
- A girl? - I think it's a boy.

2173
01:44:20,567 --> 01:44:21,976
- It's a girl. - Oh, it's a girl.

2174
01:44:21,976 --> 01:44:23,636
- So cute. - It's a girl.

2175
01:44:23,636 --> 01:44:26,277
- I think I know who it is. - Me too.

2176
01:44:26,277 --> 01:44:28,476
- I get it. - It's so obvious.

2177
01:44:28,476 --> 01:44:29,747
How can you tell right away?

2178
01:44:30,646 --> 01:44:32,987
So cute.

2179
01:44:33,216 --> 01:44:34,417
My goodness.

2180
01:44:34,417 --> 01:44:36,317
Gosh, so cute.

2181
01:44:37,117 --> 01:44:38,157
All of a sudden?

2182
01:44:38,157 --> 01:44:40,527
This is so interesting. How she changes...

2183
01:44:42,796 --> 01:44:44,296
- Was this taken yesterday? - So pretty.

2184
01:44:45,766 --> 01:44:47,296
She's so pretty.

2185
01:44:47,296 --> 01:44:48,396
- So pretty. - Right.

2186
01:44:49,266 --> 01:44:51,337
"Since Ju Yeon was young,"

2187
01:44:51,337 --> 01:44:53,407
"she always listened to others carefully..."

2188
01:44:53,407 --> 01:44:55,176
"and made good reactions."

2189
01:44:55,277 --> 01:44:58,447
"So she was always loved..."

2190
01:44:58,846 --> 01:45:00,747
"among her friends."

2191
01:45:01,346 --> 01:45:03,277
"She contemplated a lot about her career,"

2192
01:45:03,377 --> 01:45:04,987
"and she also struggled."

2193
01:45:04,987 --> 01:45:07,216
"But when I see her..."

2194
01:45:07,216 --> 01:45:09,556
"pulling it off better than anyone else,"

2195
01:45:09,556 --> 01:45:12,426
"like my mom who was a cool career woman,"

2196
01:45:12,827 --> 01:45:14,327
"I'm sure Ju Yeon will..."

2197
01:45:14,327 --> 01:45:16,527
"pull anything off without a problem."

2198
01:45:17,327 --> 01:45:19,726
She always picks the wrong seat.

2199
01:45:19,726 --> 01:45:21,296
She always sits across from me.

2200
01:45:22,136 --> 01:45:24,167
I didn't know where to look.

2201
01:45:24,167 --> 01:45:25,636
It drove me crazy.

2202
01:45:25,837 --> 01:45:28,006
"What does Ju Yeon do for a living?"

2203
01:45:28,476 --> 01:45:30,577
It's related to what I like.

2204
01:45:30,577 --> 01:45:32,577
Perhaps, women would know.

2205
01:45:32,577 --> 01:45:33,846
- Cosmetics. - Jewellery.

2206
01:45:33,846 --> 01:45:35,117
- Cosmetics. - Jewellery?

2207
01:45:35,716 --> 01:45:37,016
Oh, jewellery.

2208
01:45:37,117 --> 01:45:38,716
She has a lot.

2209
01:45:38,716 --> 01:45:41,716
She brought a whole box of it.

2210
01:45:44,087 --> 01:45:47,027
I work at the merchandise team at a jewellery company.

2211
01:45:47,527 --> 01:45:50,256
My main job is to gather all the orders...

2212
01:45:50,596 --> 01:45:53,266
and send them to the customers.

2213
01:45:54,636 --> 01:45:57,367
It's the same case, but in this colour?

2214
01:45:57,867 --> 01:46:00,337
We should produce it in pink and blue too.

2215
01:46:00,667 --> 01:46:02,337
Blue was very popular.

2216
01:46:02,337 --> 01:46:04,976
The ribbon is the trend.

2217
01:46:05,077 --> 01:46:07,777
We should make it a set with a necklace.

2219
01:46:22,796 --> 01:46:24,056
- It matches you. - Right.

2220
01:46:24,157 --> 01:46:25,896
Now, I'll flip it...

2221
01:46:25,896 --> 01:46:27,667
- Good. - to the next page.

2222
01:46:27,667 --> 01:46:28,667
This is so much.

2223
01:46:28,667 --> 01:46:30,296
This is making me nervous.

2224
01:46:30,396 --> 01:46:31,806
- Let me see. - Right.

2225
01:46:34,067 --> 01:46:36,136
- That's so cute. - Who is that?

2226
01:46:36,476 --> 01:46:37,606
I think it's a man.

2227
01:46:37,606 --> 01:46:39,046
Look at his amazing fashion.

2228
01:46:39,046 --> 01:46:41,247
He has Ferrero Rocher on his head.

2229
01:46:41,476 --> 01:46:43,216
- I think I know who it is. - Who?

2230
01:46:43,216 --> 01:46:45,346
- Who? - I have no idea.

2231
01:46:45,516 --> 01:46:46,617
I think it's Jung Sub.

2232
01:46:46,617 --> 01:46:48,716
- Flip it to the next page. - Isn't it?

2233
01:46:48,716 --> 01:46:49,787
- It's not me. - Jae Hyung?

2234
01:46:51,186 --> 01:46:53,226
- I think it's Jae Hyung. - Me?

2235
01:46:54,027 --> 01:46:55,627
- I think it's Cheol Hyeon. - Cheol Hyeon.

2236
01:46:55,627 --> 01:46:58,466
- It's Cheol Hyeon. - It's Jung Sub.

2237

- Oh, my gosh. - Really?

2240
01:47:05,306 --> 01:47:07,907
I noticed the person in the picture doesn't say anything.

2241
01:47:13,506 --> 01:47:14,877
- Is he a Celeb? - What?

2242
01:47:14,877 --> 01:47:16,046
- What is this? - What's this?

2243
01:47:16,577 --> 01:47:18,886
- He's really handsome. I mean it. - He's handsome.

2244
01:47:19,386 --> 01:47:20,817
- He looks like an actor. - I know.

2245
01:47:21,016 --> 01:47:22,256
- He looks like an actor. - Were you an actor?

2246
01:47:22,256 --> 01:47:23,356
Can I take a look at it again?

2247
01:47:23,356 --> 01:47:24,587
He's so good-looking.

2248
01:47:24,587 --> 01:47:25,926
He's very good-looking.

2249
01:47:26,027 --> 01:47:27,356
I thought maybe he was an actor.

2250
01:47:31,367 --> 01:47:35,337
- Wait. - This is crazy.

2251
01:47:36,436 --> 01:47:38,136
What?

2252
01:47:38,136 --> 01:47:41,707
(Cheol Hyeon also received his introduction from his sister.)

2253
01:47:45,306 --> 01:47:48,046
"Cheol Hyeon had a unique appearance since he was young."

2254
01:47:48,716 --> 01:47:50,377
"He had a good sense of fashion,"

2255
01:47:50,377 --> 01:47:53,186
"and he was always interested in dressing himself up."

2256
01:47:54,346 --> 01:47:55,787
"Cheol Hyeon was so cute that when he went out..."

2257
01:47:55,787 --> 01:47:57,016
"holding his mom's hand,"

2258
01:47:57,386 --> 01:47:59,426
"he drew attention with his cute face."

2259
01:48:01,226 --> 01:48:03,926
"Cheol Hyeon obtained diverse experiences in a new environment."

2260
01:48:04,867 --> 01:48:07,266
"Although it was tough for him, through that opportunity,"

2261
01:48:08,296 --> 01:48:10,697
"he was able to grow faster."

2262
01:48:12,707 --> 01:48:13,966
"He may look cold,"

2263
01:48:15,006 --> 01:48:17,377
"but his heart is softer and hotter..."

2264
01:48:17,676 --> 01:48:19,247
"than anyone..."

2265
01:48:20,707 --> 01:48:23,516
"I'm glad he was able to get a job that lets him express himself."

2266
01:48:25,046 --> 01:48:27,287
"I hope he overcomes the wounds he conceals in him..."

2267
01:48:30,056 --> 01:48:34,157
"and lives as a free man from the bottom of my heart."

2268
01:48:34,896 --> 01:48:36,556
"What does Cheol Hyeon do for a living?"

2269
01:48:39,926 --> 01:48:42,197
That's really heartwarming.

2270
01:48:42,636 --> 01:48:45,106
I tried to hold it back, but I was a bit overwhelmed...

2271
01:48:46,306 --> 01:48:48,136
when it said,

2272
01:48:48,136 --> 01:48:51,577
"The wound he conceals in him."

2273
01:48:53,577 --> 01:48:57,777
I think she wants me to bear it...

2274
01:48:57,777 --> 01:48:59,117
and live freely.

2275
01:49:00,146 --> 01:49:01,146
That word...

2276
01:49:02,056 --> 01:49:06,226
I wanted him to know...

2277
01:49:06,226 --> 01:49:08,827
how much I'm paying attention to him.

2278
01:49:11,466 --> 01:49:16,296
My sister was able to say that...

2279
01:49:17,737 --> 01:49:20,966
because she experienced...

2280
01:49:20,966 --> 01:49:23,476
the same wound.

2281
01:49:26,606 --> 01:49:30,176
I had a quick flashback...

2282
01:49:30,176 --> 01:49:34,146
of those memories in my head.

2283
01:49:36,056 --> 01:49:38,587
I'm proud of myself for enduring that time,

2284
01:49:39,027 --> 01:49:42,796
and the Chapter two of my life has begun.

2285
01:49:47,096 --> 01:49:49,766
I started working as a commercial model...

2286
01:49:49,766 --> 01:49:51,606
since 2017.

2287
01:49:52,037 --> 01:49:55,606
You're good at expressing yourself.

2288
01:49:56,136 --> 01:49:57,707
There are so many pictures to choose from.

2289
01:49:57,707 --> 01:49:58,947
(Model Cheol Hyeon can express himself freely.)

2290
01:49:59,806 --> 01:50:00,877
I was in the iHerb...

2291
01:50:00,877 --> 01:50:04,046
and Samsung washer commercials.

2292
01:50:04,146 --> 01:50:05,947
I also appeared in Jannabi's music video.

2293
01:50:06,287 --> 01:50:08,657
I still work as a commercial model.

2294
01:50:10,487 --> 01:50:14,027
My voice and the actions I make.

2295
01:50:18,296 --> 01:50:20,167
I'm interested in that,

2296
01:50:20,167 --> 01:50:21,296
and I made a lot of effort...

2297
01:50:21,296 --> 01:50:23,197
to express them.

2298
01:50:31,877 --> 01:50:35,777
(Park Cheol Hyeon, Commercial Model)

2299
01:50:36,817 --> 01:50:38,546
- A commercial model. - I knew it.

2300
01:50:38,846 --> 01:50:41,556
No wonder he looked good with everything.

2301
01:50:41,556 --> 01:50:42,787
Oh, amazing.

2302
01:50:42,987 --> 01:50:44,186
- Right. - Cool.

2303
01:50:44,186 --> 01:50:46,186
- He always looked natural. - Even when he held something,

2304
01:50:46,186 --> 01:50:48,327
- Because he's a commercial model. - he looked nice.

2305
01:50:49,926 --> 01:50:51,157
- Cool. - That was cool.

2306
01:50:51,157 --> 01:50:52,167
Incredible.

2307
01:50:52,827 --> 01:50:54,426
- What is this? - After the handsome guy?

2308
01:50:54,426 --> 01:50:55,497
Start from the first page.

2309
01:50:56,667 --> 01:50:57,936
- Wait a minute. - That's cute.

2310
01:50:57,936 --> 01:50:59,867
- It's a girl. - It's a girl.

2311
01:50:59,867 --> 01:51:01,407
- Yes, it's a girl. - She has that thing.

2312
01:51:01,407 --> 01:51:02,777
There might be a twist.

2313
01:51:02,976 --> 01:51:04,636
Are these teeth? Are they teeth in her mouth?

2314
01:51:04,636 --> 01:51:06,277
- Are they teeth? - So cute.

2315
01:51:06,277 --> 01:51:07,806
- I think I know who it is. - Is that me?

2316
01:51:08,176 --> 01:51:09,516
- I can't tell. - Is it me?

2317
01:51:09,846 --> 01:51:11,176
- Is it Se Seung? - Flip the page.

2318
01:51:11,176 --> 01:51:12,317
I think it's Se Seung.

2319
01:51:15,287 --> 01:51:16,817
- It's Se Seung. - Now I can see it.

2320
01:51:16,817 --> 01:51:18,356
- I get it now. - It's Se Seung.

2321
01:51:18,356 --> 01:51:20,256
- It's Se Seung. - Se Seung, since you were young...

2322
01:51:20,686 --> 01:51:22,856
- The half-moon eyes. - She had smiley eyes.

2323
01:51:24,726 --> 01:51:25,966
- So flexible. - Wait a minute.

2324
01:51:27,226 --> 01:51:28,667
- Is that... - Ballet?

2325
01:51:29,037 --> 01:51:31,037
- Just like that? - Really?

2326
01:51:31,197 --> 01:51:32,806
- Really? - Really?

2327
01:51:34,766 --> 01:51:36,207
It's from the day of her graduation.

2328
01:51:36,207 --> 01:51:37,636
She's so pretty.

2329
01:51:37,636 --> 01:51:40,207
- She has the same smile. - Right.

2330
01:51:40,207 --> 01:51:43,016
She looks the same as her first picture.

2331
01:51:43,016 --> 01:51:44,046
Her smile is...

2332
01:51:44,046 --> 01:51:45,947
Ju Yeon and Se Seung...

2333
01:51:45,947 --> 01:51:48,457
- have dimples here. - Yes.

2334
01:51:48,657 --> 01:51:49,756
- I have dimples too. - Right.

2335
01:51:50,016 --> 01:51:52,087
Right. There are many people with dimples.

2336
01:51:54,356 --> 01:51:55,596
- I think he has dimples slightly. - Yes.

2337
01:51:55,596 --> 01:51:57,556
- On the bottom. - Are you trying to make them?

2338
01:51:58,627 --> 01:51:59,827
I'm about to get a cramp.

2339
01:52:01,067 --> 01:52:02,237
- I'm about to get a cramp. - You know...

2340
01:52:02,237 --> 01:52:03,237
Can you open it?

2341
01:52:04,136 --> 01:52:06,237
- I'll begin reading. - Yes.

2342
01:52:06,506 --> 01:52:09,037
"Does anyone like buns?"

2343
01:52:09,476 --> 01:52:13,306
"Se Seung is white like a bun..."

2344
01:52:13,646 --> 01:52:15,777
- "freshly out of the steamer." - That's so cute.

2345
01:52:16,216 --> 01:52:17,346
That's so cute.

2346
01:52:17,546 --> 01:52:19,146
Who wrote this?

2347
01:52:20,917 --> 01:52:24,487
"She used to have deep cute dimples."

2348
01:52:24,587 --> 01:52:27,287
"Unlike me who hates hassles,"

2349
01:52:27,287 --> 01:52:29,197
"she used to become the class president..."

2350
01:52:29,197 --> 01:52:32,226
"and also studied hard."

2351
01:52:32,596 --> 01:52:35,567
"She joined various clubs in university,"

2352
01:52:35,737 --> 01:52:37,197
"yet she received A plus..."

2353
01:52:37,197 --> 01:52:38,367
- I knew it. - "from all her classes."

2354
01:52:38,367 --> 01:52:41,006
- She really lived a perfect life. - That's amazing.

2355
01:52:41,537 --> 01:52:44,037
"In graduate school, she must've felt inadequate..."

2356
01:52:44,037 --> 01:52:46,506
- "compared to other researchers." - Researchers?

2357
01:52:49,817 --> 01:52:54,117
"Watching her studying overnight with determination..."

2358
01:52:54,117 --> 01:52:56,657
"influenced me a lot."

2359
01:52:57,417 --> 01:52:59,787
"I look forward to..."

2360
01:53:00,226 --> 01:53:03,256
"Se Seung who leads her life independently and her future."

2361
01:53:05,266 --> 01:53:07,296
- Good job. - This is really nothing.

2362
01:53:07,296 --> 01:53:08,596
- Good job. - Good job.

2363
01:53:08,596 --> 01:53:09,837
Good job. I mean it.

2364
01:53:10,237 --> 01:53:11,296
I think she's a ballerina.

2365
01:53:12,936 --> 01:53:14,976
It says you're a researcher.

2366
01:53:15,077 --> 01:53:16,877
- Do you research on ballet? - I said it out of nowhere.

2367
01:53:19,006 --> 01:53:21,676
I worked as a management strategy consultant...

2368
01:53:21,777 --> 01:53:25,346
at an overseas company...

2369
01:53:25,646 --> 01:53:27,646
- until recently. - Until recently.

2370
01:53:28,957 --> 01:53:30,657
I'm currently preparing to get a new job.

2371
01:53:32,157 --> 01:53:33,556
- Consulting? - A consultant.

2372
01:53:33,556 --> 01:53:36,226
- Yes, a strategy consultant. - Consultant.

2373
01:53:37,726 --> 01:53:40,426
When a company plans merger and acquisitions...

2374
01:53:40,527 --> 01:53:42,367
or has to come up with a long-term strategy...

2375
01:53:42,367 --> 01:53:44,567
on a new business or something,

2376
01:53:44,567 --> 01:53:46,766
I go over validity.

2377
01:53:46,867 --> 01:53:49,476
I was in charge of the projects...

2378
01:53:49,476 --> 01:53:53,207
to evaluate the expected values.

2379
01:53:53,207 --> 01:53:56,077
(Park Se Seung, getting ready to get a new job)

2380
01:53:56,247 --> 01:53:58,447
I majored in business administration...

2381
01:53:58,447 --> 01:54:00,546
and applied statistics.

2382
01:54:00,817 --> 01:54:04,056
I wanted to study statistics more,

2383
01:54:04,186 --> 01:54:07,186
so I studied statistical data science in graduate school.

2384
01:54:07,886 --> 01:54:09,197
- Cool. - That's cool.

2385
01:54:09,197 --> 01:54:10,827
Overseas strategies...

2386
01:54:10,827 --> 01:54:12,027
- She's a smart girl. - Do you work in that field?

2387
01:54:12,027 --> 01:54:13,067
She's smart.

2388
01:54:13,067 --> 01:54:15,136
Management strategy consulting? What is that?

2389
01:54:15,136 --> 01:54:16,266
I'm getting curious.

2390
01:54:16,266 --> 01:54:19,466
I want to know how she's like when she's at work.

2391
01:54:19,466 --> 01:54:22,806
I noticed she was shrewd.

2392
01:54:23,306 --> 01:54:24,407
I thought she was cool.

2393
01:54:24,806 --> 01:54:26,546
Se Seung, flip the page.

2394
01:54:26,546 --> 01:54:28,546
- Okay. - All right.

2395
01:54:31,917 --> 01:54:33,146
My goodness.

2396
01:54:34,247 --> 01:54:35,487
He had the same eyes.

2397
01:54:35,487 --> 01:54:37,056
- As soon as I saw the photo... - Who is this?

2398
01:54:37,056 --> 01:54:39,856
- He had the same eyes. - It can't be helped.

2399
01:54:40,587 --> 01:54:42,127
How cute.

2400
01:54:42,226 --> 01:54:43,527
His arms were very chubby.

2401
01:54:43,527 --> 01:54:45,396
He had muscular arms since then.

2402
01:54:45,497 --> 01:54:47,067
He was born with them.

2403
01:54:47,426 --> 01:54:48,497
Who is this?

2404
01:54:48,497 --> 01:54:50,936
- "Who is this?" - Who is this?

2405
01:54:52,636 --> 01:54:53,766
- What? - What is this?

2406
01:54:55,707 --> 01:54:57,907
He looked like a kid named Brian.

2407
01:54:57,907 --> 01:55:00,277
Turn the page.

2408
01:55:00,277 --> 01:55:01,277
That's cute.

2409
01:55:01,277 --> 01:55:03,447
- I can't look at the photos. - That's cute.

2410
01:55:03,447 --> 01:55:04,947
- When you talk to him... - This is unbelievable.

2411
01:55:05,346 --> 01:55:06,716
He looks sly in this picture.

2412
01:55:06,716 --> 01:55:08,016
- Seriously. - Don't you think so?

2413
01:55:08,117 --> 01:55:10,386
In one photo, he looked like an unstoppable elementary schooler.

2414
01:55:10,787 --> 01:55:14,957
"Hush, don't tell anyone." One photo had that vibe.

2415
01:55:15,056 --> 01:55:16,056
He looked cute.

2416
01:55:16,556 --> 01:55:18,226
Of course, my younger brother looked cute.

2417
01:55:18,697 --> 01:55:21,096
In New Jersey...

2418
01:55:21,867 --> 01:55:24,067
- What? - How was he so handsome?

2419
01:55:24,067 --> 01:55:25,436
He looked like an adult.

2420
01:55:27,237 --> 01:55:29,907
- He was so handsome. - I spotted something.

2421
01:55:30,737 --> 01:55:32,077
He was a man with a sexy brain.

2422
01:55:34,207 --> 01:55:36,777
- I see. - You saw the school name, right?

2423
01:55:36,777 --> 01:55:37,777
He must have liked...

2424
01:55:37,777 --> 01:55:39,917
- science a lot. - A science high school.

2425
01:55:41,287 --> 01:55:42,317
So handsome.

2426
01:55:43,617 --> 01:55:44,617
What?

2427
01:55:44,856 --> 01:55:47,226
- What's up with him? - What's up with him?

2428
01:55:47,226 --> 01:55:48,327
I want him.

2429
01:55:50,497 --> 01:55:51,497
What?

2430
01:55:51,497 --> 01:55:52,497
(He became Jung Sub he is now.)

2431
01:55:52,596 --> 01:55:54,867
That explains the Apple laptop.

2432
01:55:54,867 --> 01:55:56,596
What's up with his sideburns?

2433
01:55:56,796 --> 01:55:58,936
- Is he a web developer? - I see.

2434
01:55:59,506 --> 01:56:01,037
I will read it.

2435
01:56:02,407 --> 01:56:03,506
"Jung Sub got his brain..."

2436
01:56:03,506 --> 01:56:05,877
"for natural sciences from his dad..."

2437
01:56:05,976 --> 01:56:08,976
"and his senses for the arts from his mom."

2438
01:56:09,777 --> 01:56:12,987
"Jung Sub, who was like a healthy and strong teddy bear..."

2439
01:56:14,146 --> 01:56:15,157
Don't laugh.

2440
01:56:15,287 --> 01:56:17,256
- What? - What?

2441
01:56:17,256 --> 01:56:19,686
I could just picture him like that. I remembered the photos.

2442
01:56:19,686 --> 01:56:20,856
We saw his arms.

2443
01:56:20,856 --> 01:56:24,426
"entered a dance club when he was supposed to study..."

2444
01:56:24,756 --> 01:56:26,266
"in high school."

2445
01:56:26,766 --> 01:56:30,037
"He made his name known as the Little U-Know Yunho..."

2446
01:56:30,136 --> 01:56:31,197
- U-Know Yunho. - U-Know Yunho.

2447
01:56:32,337 --> 01:56:34,737
"And made his dad exasperated."

2448
01:56:35,737 --> 01:56:38,976
"If someone becomes close to my sibling,"

2449
01:56:38,976 --> 01:56:42,176
"he might show his hidden talent to her."

2450
01:56:42,176 --> 01:56:43,447
- Show us. - Show us.

2451
01:56:43,447 --> 01:56:45,046
- Show us. - If you look here,

2452
01:56:45,046 --> 01:56:47,247
it says, "If someone becomes close to my sibling..."

2453
01:56:47,247 --> 01:56:48,247
I am disappointed.

2454
01:56:48,556 --> 01:56:50,317
Dance really didn't occur to me.

2455
01:56:50,417 --> 01:56:52,426
One trait of my ideal type is...

2456
01:56:52,527 --> 01:56:55,327
someone who can enjoy my good cheer...

2457
01:56:55,327 --> 01:56:58,356
by dancing with me.

2458
01:56:58,466 --> 01:57:00,827
I thought, "Will I be someone who becomes close to him?"

2459
01:57:03,697 --> 01:57:06,237
I think I will answer correctly right away...

2460
01:57:06,237 --> 01:57:07,466
if I take a guess.

2461
01:57:07,466 --> 01:57:09,407
- So I will give people a chance. - Go ahead.

2462
01:57:09,506 --> 01:57:11,277
- Seriously. - Get it right at once.

2463
01:57:11,277 --> 01:57:12,447
- Get it right at once. - Who cares?

2464
01:57:12,447 --> 01:57:13,546
- Who cares? - He has a hunch.

2465
01:57:13,546 --> 01:57:15,617
The CEO of an AI-related startup.

2466
01:57:17,016 --> 01:57:18,686
In any case, he majored in computer engineering...

2467
01:57:18,686 --> 01:57:19,716
- or something. - That was detailed.

2468
01:57:20,247 --> 01:57:21,817
- IT. - Yes.

2469
01:57:22,516 --> 01:57:25,657
Currently, I am an AI researcher.

2470
01:57:26,426 --> 01:57:28,896
- I knew it. - That's my job.

2471
01:57:29,497 --> 01:57:31,697
(Seoul National University)

2472
01:57:31,697 --> 01:57:32,726
(Graduate School Research Room)

2473
01:57:34,966 --> 01:57:38,537
I am researching bioinformatics at Seoul National University.

2474
01:57:38,537 --> 01:57:40,037
I am an AI researcher.

2475
01:57:45,777 --> 01:57:47,377
While researching the field that analyses...

2476
01:57:47,377 --> 01:57:48,976
and makes sense of biological data,

2477
01:57:48,976 --> 01:57:51,046
I am currently doing my doctoral program.

2478
01:57:52,846 --> 01:57:54,987
The process of selecting the leads is called...

2479
01:57:54,987 --> 01:57:56,487
lead identification.

2480
01:57:56,587 --> 01:57:59,226
That's the essential point of this dissertation.

2481
01:58:00,487 --> 01:58:03,157
(Lee Jung Sub, AI researcher)

2482
01:58:04,896 --> 01:58:06,266
He is really cool.

2483
01:58:06,627 --> 01:58:08,197
- His future is promising. - AI.

2484
01:58:08,667 --> 01:58:09,997
We weren't qualified...

2485
01:58:09,997 --> 01:58:11,766
to judge these people.

2486
01:58:11,766 --> 01:58:14,367
Seriously. It wasn't our job to do that.

2487
01:58:14,466 --> 01:58:15,976
Please edit out everything I said...

2488
01:58:15,976 --> 01:58:18,237
- from Episode One to this one. - If I ever sad...

2489
01:58:18,237 --> 01:58:19,947
anything bad about them, please edit it out.

2490
01:58:21,006 --> 01:58:22,617
Jung Sub, I apologize in advance.

2491
01:58:22,617 --> 01:58:24,877
Given his looks and profession,

2492
01:58:24,877 --> 01:58:26,087
he is bound to be popular.

2493
01:58:26,087 --> 01:58:29,256
He speaks logically too.

2494
01:58:29,356 --> 01:58:30,957
Bioinformatics...

2495
01:58:31,487 --> 01:58:35,157
is a field that mixes biology and computer science...

2496
01:58:35,157 --> 01:58:36,926
for AI.

2497
01:58:37,027 --> 01:58:38,296
Is it deep learning?

2498
01:58:38,296 --> 01:58:39,567
Yes, it's deep learning.

2499
01:58:39,667 --> 01:58:41,466
I see that you do deep learning.

2500
01:58:41,896 --> 01:58:43,867
I studied it in graduate school.

2501
01:58:43,867 --> 01:58:47,106
- Yes. In graduate school... - That's incredible.

2502
01:58:47,207 --> 01:58:50,976
When Se Seung revealed her job,

2503
01:58:51,337 --> 01:58:52,777
I was very surprised...

2504
01:58:52,877 --> 01:58:55,046
because we were in similar fields.

2505
01:58:55,046 --> 01:58:59,146
I think we will have a lot to talk about.

2506
01:59:00,046 --> 01:59:01,417
"Is this fate?"

2507
01:59:02,356 --> 01:59:03,886
I had that thought...

2508
01:59:03,886 --> 01:59:08,186
because I like someone who is in a similar field.

2509
01:59:08,287 --> 01:59:11,197
It was exactly him. The AI researcher.

2510
01:59:11,827 --> 01:59:13,796
I wanted to do a doctoral degree too.

2511
01:59:13,896 --> 01:59:16,766
I thought, "How is someone who is so similar..."

2512
01:59:16,766 --> 01:59:19,106
"to the one I was looking for here?"

2513
01:59:19,606 --> 01:59:21,067
It was a bit shocking.

2514
01:59:22,207 --> 01:59:24,707
- It's fascinating indeed. - She is blinded by love.

2515
01:59:24,707 --> 01:59:26,106
She thinks everything is fate.

2516
01:59:26,546 --> 01:59:28,617
If he eats a burger, she will go, "I had a burger before."

2517
01:59:30,247 --> 01:59:31,947
- "It's fate." - Everything fits.

2518
01:59:32,247 --> 01:59:33,386
- "It's fate." - "I am a person too."

2519
01:59:33,386 --> 01:59:34,846
- That's right. - "It's fate."

2520
01:59:34,947 --> 01:59:36,957
- "It's fate." - "I am a person too."

2521
01:59:36,957 --> 01:59:39,027
- "It's fate." - "It's fate for all mankind."

2522
01:59:39,627 --> 01:59:41,087
Ta-Da.

2523
01:59:41,087 --> 01:59:42,497
What? It's a kiss.

2524
01:59:42,497 --> 01:59:44,226
- The dad is kissing him. - Who is it?

2525
01:59:44,226 --> 01:59:45,256
He is eating him.

2526
01:59:45,827 --> 01:59:47,327
The next photo. Are you done?

2527
01:59:47,327 --> 01:59:48,527
He had the same chin.

2528
01:59:49,766 --> 01:59:50,936
- What a queen. - What?

2529
01:59:50,936 --> 01:59:52,506
Did she grow up right away?

2530
01:59:52,766 --> 01:59:55,877
- Seriously. - Where are the photos...

2531
01:59:55,877 --> 01:59:57,976
from the 20 years in between?

2532
01:59:58,077 --> 01:59:59,346
What happened?

2533
02:00:02,976 --> 02:00:04,747
After Mom passed away,

2534
02:00:04,747 --> 02:00:09,117
Dad got rid of all the photo albums...

2535
02:00:09,516 --> 02:00:11,417
so that the longing wouldn't grow.

2536
02:00:11,417 --> 02:00:13,087
So I don't have many photos from my younger days.

2537
02:00:14,287 --> 02:00:17,396
I was jealous of the photos that let them reminisce about...

2538
02:00:18,226 --> 02:00:19,596
their childhood.

2539
02:00:21,096 --> 02:00:23,296
In one hand, I was disappointed.

2540
02:00:25,407 --> 02:00:26,407
Hold on.

2541
02:00:28,006 --> 02:00:29,306
- What? - How are you so pretty?

2542
02:00:29,306 --> 02:00:30,676
- It's an incredible photo. - I think she dances.

2543
02:00:30,676 --> 02:00:31,907
She is a dancer.

2544
02:00:33,476 --> 02:00:36,447
She is a yoga instructor. I told you so.

2545
02:00:37,046 --> 02:00:38,216
I guessed correctly that she was a dancer.

2546
02:00:38,216 --> 02:00:40,346
- So this is how it feels. - A dancer.

2547
02:00:40,346 --> 02:00:42,157
- Seriously. - That's incredible.

2548
02:00:42,256 --> 02:00:43,356
- But... - Are you floating in the air?

2549
02:00:43,356 --> 02:00:45,556
What are you saying?

2550
02:00:48,127 --> 02:00:50,327
As I flipped through her photos,

2551
02:00:50,827 --> 02:00:52,627
I thought,

2552
02:00:52,627 --> 02:00:56,037
"My sister is doing what she wants to do..."

2553
02:00:57,436 --> 02:00:58,667
"and living the life..."

2554
02:00:58,667 --> 02:01:02,636
"that suits her and is enjoyable to her."

2555
02:01:03,907 --> 02:01:06,846
"Cho A is someone who is sensitive and easygoing..."

2556
02:01:06,846 --> 02:01:08,407
"at the same time."

2557
02:01:09,777 --> 02:01:13,216
"She is very curious, so she stands and stares..."

2558
02:01:13,216 --> 02:01:15,117
"when something catches her eyes on the street."

2559
02:01:15,216 --> 02:01:16,756
"She falls deep in thought..."

2560
02:01:16,756 --> 02:01:19,087
- "and shows her eccentric side." - How cute.

2561
02:01:19,527 --> 02:01:22,756
"Ever since she was little, she had a strong sense of responsibility."

2562
02:01:22,856 --> 02:01:25,567
"When a burglar broke into the house in childhood,"

2563
02:01:25,667 --> 02:01:27,997
"she wrapped her arms around me in order to protect me..."

2564
02:01:28,096 --> 02:01:31,096
"even though she was just a little girl."

2565
02:01:31,567 --> 02:01:33,537
It's so heartwarming.

2566
02:01:33,636 --> 02:01:35,537
It isn't easy to do that...

2567
02:01:35,537 --> 02:01:38,006
- in front of a burglar. - I know.

2568
02:01:39,106 --> 02:01:41,046
I suddenly got goosebumps.

2569
02:01:43,277 --> 02:01:44,317
She is cute.

2570
02:01:44,817 --> 02:01:46,686
I was very surprised. How...

2571
02:01:47,216 --> 02:01:49,216
She must be very warmhearted...

2572
02:01:49,216 --> 02:01:50,617
and thoughtful.

2573
02:01:51,157 --> 02:01:52,587
She was very brave.

2574
02:01:53,327 --> 02:01:57,396
I could picture her trying to protect her brother.

2575
02:01:57,396 --> 02:01:58,997
It brought tears to my eyes.

2576
02:02:01,027 --> 02:02:04,867
"Recently, I went hiking with Cho A."

2577
02:02:05,037 --> 02:02:07,667
"I remember reaching the summit..."

2578
02:02:07,667 --> 02:02:08,936
"as we depended on each other,"

2579
02:02:09,037 --> 02:02:11,577
"pushed each other's backs, and held each other's hands."

2580
02:02:11,837 --> 02:02:13,707
"We promised..."

2581
02:02:13,707 --> 02:02:17,216
"to be each other's support whenever we faced a new challenge."

2582
02:02:18,546 --> 02:02:20,987
"What do you think Cho A does for a living?"

2583
02:02:21,817 --> 02:02:23,417
The siblings are so close.

2584
02:02:23,417 --> 02:02:24,817
Seriously.

2585
02:02:24,917 --> 02:02:28,027
I am a Juvis Diet consultant.

2586
02:02:28,127 --> 02:02:29,356
I know what it is.

2587
02:02:29,457 --> 02:02:31,827
I want a consultation.

2588
02:02:31,827 --> 02:02:33,167
Me too.

2589
02:02:33,367 --> 02:02:36,136
Before that, I worked as a yoga instructor.

2590
02:02:36,436 --> 02:02:38,936
I developed an interest...

2591
02:02:38,936 --> 02:02:41,667
and worked as a yoga instructor in the past.

2592
02:02:42,136 --> 02:02:46,207
I studied and worked in the industry regarding health...

2593
02:02:47,146 --> 02:02:48,277
and healthcare.

2594
02:02:48,377 --> 02:02:51,676
Now, I work as a diet consultant.

2595
02:02:52,046 --> 02:02:54,817
Since I graduated with a food and nutrition major,

2596
02:02:54,817 --> 02:02:58,216
I analyse the clients' body composition results...

2597
02:02:58,216 --> 02:02:59,386
in details...

2598
02:02:59,487 --> 02:03:02,027
and give them a diet consultation.

2599
02:03:02,127 --> 02:03:04,697
If we increase your resistance to physical stress...

2600
02:03:04,697 --> 02:03:07,697
and strengthen your immunity before entering the program...

2601
02:03:08,426 --> 02:03:12,506
I work as someone who takes care of their health.

2602
02:03:15,237 --> 02:03:18,207
(Park Cho A, Juvis Diet consultant)

2603
02:03:20,106 --> 02:03:22,247
That explains the hairstyle and clothes...

2604
02:03:22,247 --> 02:03:24,317
she wore to work.

2605
02:03:24,317 --> 02:03:25,317
That's right.

2606
02:03:27,146 --> 02:03:28,487
It really suited her.

2607
02:03:28,686 --> 02:03:30,917
She helps other people...

2608
02:03:30,917 --> 02:03:32,987
while leading a healthy life.

2609
02:03:34,027 --> 02:03:35,596
It looked nice and cool.

2610
02:03:36,027 --> 02:03:37,256
She is a cool person.

2611
02:03:38,627 --> 02:03:40,796
- She has a beautiful body. - She has elegance.

2612
02:03:40,796 --> 02:03:42,737
- That's right. She is graceful. - I see...

2613
02:03:42,737 --> 02:03:43,766
that everyone had the same thought.

2614
02:03:43,766 --> 02:03:45,806
"These people will come to me later."

2615
02:03:46,837 --> 02:03:48,636
"I secured seven customers."

2616
02:03:48,636 --> 02:03:49,707
I will send the money right away.

2617
02:03:51,037 --> 02:03:52,707
My problem is my arms.

2618
02:03:52,707 --> 02:03:54,306
Judging by the photos, it was in the genes.

2619
02:03:54,846 --> 02:03:56,846
- You saw the photos. - Ever since you were a baby...

2620
02:03:56,846 --> 02:03:58,747
- It can't be helped. - You were born with them.

2621
02:03:58,747 --> 02:03:59,917
- It can't be helped. - They are muscles.

2622
02:04:00,016 --> 02:04:01,016
That's right.

2623
02:04:01,516 --> 02:04:04,087
- It was touching. - I know.

2624
02:04:04,087 --> 02:04:05,556
In a day

2625
02:04:07,356 --> 02:04:08,386
How cute.

2626
02:04:09,497 --> 02:04:12,627
- In childhood... - How cute. Seriously.

2627
02:04:14,096 --> 02:04:16,296
- My goodness. - She looked the same back then.

2628
02:04:16,296 --> 02:04:18,067
- She was so cute. - I can see the same looks.

2629
02:04:18,067 --> 02:04:19,707
- Is she your mom? - Yes.

2630
02:04:19,707 --> 02:04:20,837
How pretty.

2631
02:04:23,077 --> 02:04:24,907
- Here comes a feint. - A feint.

2632
02:04:24,907 --> 02:04:25,976
Here comes a feint.

2633
02:04:25,976 --> 02:04:27,006
Is that a cello?

2634
02:04:31,716 --> 02:04:33,417
- My goodness. - She is a cellist.

2635
02:04:33,417 --> 02:04:34,447
She is a cellist.

2636
02:04:36,317 --> 02:04:39,686
(Yun Ha still has a cello by her side.)

2637
02:04:39,686 --> 02:04:41,356
- She is a cellist. - She is a cellist.

2638
02:04:42,087 --> 02:04:43,796
- It's actually her job. - I mean...

2639
02:04:43,896 --> 02:04:45,667
It's actually her job. It isn't a hobby.

2640
02:04:45,667 --> 02:04:47,466
- Why did we say it was a feint? - What is this?

2641
02:04:47,796 --> 02:04:49,497
Yale University.

2642
02:04:49,737 --> 02:04:52,367
People became surprised upon seeing the photo of her playing the cello.

2643
02:04:52,367 --> 02:04:53,567
They went, "What?"

2644
02:04:53,667 --> 02:04:55,167
"What?"

2645
02:04:55,737 --> 02:04:57,377
I was like, "That's my sister."

2646
02:04:58,537 --> 02:05:02,176
"Ever since she was little, Yun Ha was a lovely girl..."

2647
02:05:02,176 --> 02:05:06,046
"who made the family members melt with her pretty eye smile."

2648
02:05:06,487 --> 02:05:08,417
"For her career,"

2649
02:05:08,417 --> 02:05:10,886
"she persevered when she was lonely while studying abroad alone."

2650
02:05:10,886 --> 02:05:14,027
"She is a competent woman who even got a scholarship..."

2651
02:05:14,127 --> 02:05:15,926
"thanks to her high GPA."

2652
02:05:18,997 --> 02:05:22,396
"While her profession requires her to be more sensitive than anyone,"

2653
02:05:22,636 --> 02:05:26,006
"she is unexpectedly simple and cool in daily life."

2654
02:05:26,006 --> 02:05:27,667
"She has various charms."

2655
02:05:29,176 --> 02:05:32,136
"Yun Ha is someone who has a strong desire to grow."

2656
02:05:32,546 --> 02:05:35,207
"Ever since she was little, she ran toward her dream..."

2657
02:05:35,207 --> 02:05:37,247
"in a diligent and simple manner."

2658
02:05:37,247 --> 02:05:39,247
"She seemed like a fool at times,"

2659
02:05:39,417 --> 02:05:42,457
"but that side made her who she is now."

2660
02:05:43,417 --> 02:05:46,957
She read the letter with a smile on her face.

2661
02:05:47,957 --> 02:05:49,896
She seemed to be thinking,

2662
02:05:49,896 --> 02:05:53,127
"What did he write about me?"

2663
02:05:55,567 --> 02:05:57,296
Suddenly, I am close to tearing up.

2664
02:05:57,296 --> 02:06:00,067
Hold on. I am close to tearing up.

2665
02:06:00,067 --> 02:06:01,136
Hold on.

2666
02:06:01,207 --> 02:06:04,176
Seriously. I was proud of him.

2667
02:06:05,237 --> 02:06:06,907
I was so thankful.

2668
02:06:07,377 --> 02:06:09,546
"It's my wish that the path she takes in the future..."

2669
02:06:09,546 --> 02:06:12,277
"will be filled with brilliant melodies."

2670
02:06:12,617 --> 02:06:14,617
- My goodness. - "Clap, clap."

2671
02:06:15,917 --> 02:06:18,556
"What do you think Yun Ha does for a living?"

2672
02:06:23,896 --> 02:06:25,697
I am a cellist.

2673
02:06:27,497 --> 02:06:29,997
I began learning cello at the age of eight.

2674
02:06:30,266 --> 02:06:32,567
After graduating from Korea National University of Arts,

2675
02:06:34,067 --> 02:06:37,176
I got my Master's degree at Yale University.

2676
02:06:38,377 --> 02:06:39,806
I teach cello to students...

2677
02:06:39,806 --> 02:06:42,877
at Korea National Institute for the Gifted in Arts.

2678
02:07:13,176 --> 02:07:15,846
(Lee Yun Ha, Cellist)

2679
02:07:15,846 --> 02:07:17,516
She is cool.

2680
02:07:17,516 --> 02:07:19,247
I should ask her for a session.

2681
02:07:19,886 --> 02:07:21,087
- I see her in a different light. - I get excited...

2682
02:07:21,087 --> 02:07:22,487
when I see someone with that bag.

2683
02:07:23,617 --> 02:07:25,016
She is so cool.

2684
02:07:25,457 --> 02:07:27,886
- Didn't you bring your cello? - How cool.

2685
02:07:27,886 --> 02:07:29,426
- Didn't you bring it? - Right. Didn't you bring it?

2686
02:07:29,426 --> 02:07:31,157
I really want to hear you play the cello.

2687
02:07:31,726 --> 02:07:32,766
Did you bring it?

2688
02:07:32,766 --> 02:07:34,896
- It will be so nice to hear it. - Well, I can bring it.

2689
02:07:35,197 --> 02:07:36,636
- I am so curious. - That's right.

2690
02:07:36,636 --> 02:07:38,096
At what age did you begin learning it?

2691
02:07:38,367 --> 02:07:40,707
I began at the age of eight.

2692
02:07:41,006 --> 02:07:43,237
I thought about learning the violin.

2693
02:07:44,207 --> 02:07:46,207
But I didn't like the violin since I had to play it standing up.

2694
02:07:46,506 --> 02:07:49,646
- You play the cello sitting down. - My legs hurt too much.

2695
02:07:50,247 --> 02:07:51,917
Your reasoning was very simple.

2696
02:07:52,646 --> 02:07:54,146
I've been simple since then.

2697
02:07:54,386 --> 02:07:56,256
"I don't want to play an instrument that makes me stand up."

2698
02:07:56,516 --> 02:07:59,157
She found her passion early on...

2699
02:07:59,886 --> 02:08:03,926
and continued to pursue it. It made me envious.

2700
02:08:04,127 --> 02:08:07,997
I also became curious about Yun Ha's life.

2701
02:08:08,466 --> 02:08:11,667
We should play the instruments in turn.

2702
02:08:11,667 --> 02:08:14,006
- That sounds good. - We should do that.

2703
02:08:14,006 --> 02:08:16,377
- We should have collaborations. - For someone, it's the voice.

2704
02:08:16,636 --> 02:08:18,707
- It's this one. - The last one.

2705
02:08:19,777 --> 02:08:21,676
- Really? - Yes.

2706
02:08:21,976 --> 02:08:23,346
- It's a boy. - Me too.

2707
02:08:23,346 --> 02:08:24,516
It's so obvious.

2708
02:08:25,546 --> 02:08:28,447
I could tell even though I was seeing it upside down.

2709
02:08:28,447 --> 02:08:30,056
Even if I see it from a passing car, I would know that it's Jae Hyung.

2710
02:08:30,056 --> 02:08:32,117
- This is... - What a pretty baby.

2711
02:08:32,117 --> 02:08:33,426
I want to touch him.

2712
02:08:33,527 --> 02:08:36,296
- He had big eyes as a baby. - I know.

2713
02:08:39,296 --> 02:08:40,327
How cute.

2714
02:08:40,327 --> 02:08:42,936
He was well-proportioned even as a child.

2715
02:08:43,266 --> 02:08:45,037
- He had nice facial features. - What?

2716
02:08:45,037 --> 02:08:46,867
- "Jae Hyung," - The Strawberry Prince?

2717
02:08:46,867 --> 02:08:49,407
"it must have been hard to raise the strawberry plant."

2718
02:08:49,407 --> 02:08:51,476
"Jae Hyung's strawberry plant was voted..."

2719
02:08:51,476 --> 02:08:54,707
"to be the best, and he became the Strawberry Prince."

2720
02:08:54,877 --> 02:08:56,617
He became the Strawberry Prince.

2721
02:08:56,947 --> 02:08:58,716
I guess his plant had big strawberries.

2722
02:08:58,947 --> 02:09:00,016
How cute.

2723
02:09:00,546 --> 02:09:01,716
Strawberry Prince.

2724
02:09:01,716 --> 02:09:04,056
- Strawberry Prince. - My goodness.

2725
02:09:04,386 --> 02:09:06,226
- Strawberry Prince. - Strawberry Prince.

2726
02:09:06,226 --> 02:09:07,987
I remember Strawberry Prince too.

2727
02:09:07,987 --> 02:09:09,756
I am going to call him Strawberry Prince from now on.

2728
02:09:09,756 --> 02:09:11,157
"Strawberry Prince."

2729
02:09:11,856 --> 02:09:14,266
The title, Strawberry Prince, suited him very well.

2730
02:09:14,266 --> 02:09:16,266
- You must have been proud. - Yes.

2731
02:09:16,966 --> 02:09:18,367
I love strawberries.

2732
02:09:19,466 --> 02:09:21,936
- How cute. - That hamster was A Rong.

2733
02:09:22,136 --> 02:09:23,506
A Rong?

2734
02:09:23,506 --> 02:09:24,976
(Park A Rong)

2735
02:09:25,407 --> 02:09:26,546
Was the hamster okay?

2736
02:09:27,877 --> 02:09:29,046
- A Rong. - Was there Da Rong too?

2737
02:09:29,046 --> 02:09:30,447
- Yes. I had two hamsters. - I see.

2738
02:09:30,716 --> 02:09:32,277
- You are sharp. - Are you guys siblings?

2739
02:09:32,617 --> 02:09:34,247
I had two hamsters, A Rong and Da Rong.

2740
02:09:34,247 --> 02:09:35,317
A Rong and Da Rong.

2741
02:09:36,487 --> 02:09:39,117
- What? Isn't that sudden? - Did he begin studying?

2742
02:09:39,386 --> 02:09:40,386
(Isn't that sudden?)

2743
02:09:40,726 --> 02:09:42,657
(She bursts out laughing.)

2744
02:09:42,657 --> 02:09:44,356
- That's sudden. - Did he begin studying?

2745
02:09:45,157 --> 02:09:46,726
- Why did he suddenly change? - Suddenly...

2746
02:09:47,226 --> 02:09:49,167
- Was that... - He had a sudden glow-down.

2747
02:09:49,266 --> 02:09:50,466
Was that when you began studying?

2748
02:09:50,466 --> 02:09:52,936
- Just how much did you study? - My eyesight...

2749
02:09:52,936 --> 02:09:55,337
My eyesight became terrible.

2750
02:09:55,337 --> 02:09:56,337
I see.

2751
02:09:56,337 --> 02:09:57,537
You should have studied less.

2752
02:09:57,537 --> 02:10:00,577
- It's an unexpected charm. - That startled me.

2753
02:10:00,947 --> 02:10:02,407
It was so funny.

2754
02:10:02,546 --> 02:10:04,277
He was really cute.

2755
02:10:04,546 --> 02:10:08,287
Then it was suddenly like, "Who is this nerd?"

2756
02:10:09,756 --> 02:10:13,726
I had severe near-sightedness,

2757
02:10:14,287 --> 02:10:16,697
so my looks were a bit... Yes.

2758
02:10:16,926 --> 02:10:19,157
Other people became silent.

2759
02:10:20,027 --> 02:10:21,966
(Jae Hyung took up the guitar instead of a pen as an adult.)

2760
02:10:21,966 --> 02:10:23,567
A band.

2761
02:10:23,867 --> 02:10:25,096
- A band. - He is wearing sunglasses.

2762
02:10:25,096 --> 02:10:26,837
- Are you crying? - No.

2763
02:10:28,106 --> 02:10:30,837
Do you sing and play the guitar?

2764
02:10:30,976 --> 02:10:32,136
Yes.

2765
02:10:32,537 --> 02:10:33,976
- Do you write songs too? - That's insane.

2766
02:10:33,976 --> 02:10:35,346
Yes, I write songs.

2767
02:10:37,247 --> 02:10:39,287
- That's cool. - All right. He will read it.

2768
02:10:39,287 --> 02:10:41,146
- It's long. - I know.

2769
02:10:41,146 --> 02:10:42,146
It's the longest.

2770
02:10:42,146 --> 02:10:44,386
I was confident that I wouldn't cry when my brother read the letter.

2771
02:10:44,386 --> 02:10:45,886
I already knew what it said.

2772
02:10:47,957 --> 02:10:51,827
"In childhood, Jae Hyung and I always held hands."

2773
02:10:52,296 --> 02:10:54,426
"If I was crying in bed..."

2774
02:10:54,426 --> 02:10:56,237
"after fighting with my friends,"

2775
02:10:56,237 --> 02:10:59,337
"Jae Hyung comforted me even though he was young."

2776
02:10:59,737 --> 02:11:02,037
"He was a mature and kind child."

2777
02:11:02,636 --> 02:11:05,476
"When puberty hit,"

2778
02:11:05,476 --> 02:11:08,577
"he ignored me when he ran into me outside."

2779
02:11:08,806 --> 02:11:10,016
It must have been upsetting.

2780
02:11:10,016 --> 02:11:12,686
"He has always liked to sing at the top of his lungs,"

2781
02:11:13,046 --> 02:11:15,146
"so he ended up making a band."

2782
02:11:15,617 --> 02:11:18,686
"When Jae Hyung sang 'Bus Stop' and said that it was dedicated..."

2783
02:11:18,686 --> 02:11:20,157
"to Mom,"

2784
02:11:20,157 --> 02:11:22,627
"I shed tears in secret because I was so touched."

2785
02:11:23,296 --> 02:11:27,167
"Jae Hyung used to chase after the romance of being on the stage."

2786
02:11:27,396 --> 02:11:30,237
"When he came to terms with reality and began studying,"

2787
02:11:30,237 --> 02:11:31,936
"my heart ached."

2788
02:11:32,907 --> 02:11:34,737
"Knowing that he is someone..."

2789
02:11:34,737 --> 02:11:37,537
"who gives his absolute best when his mind is set,"

2790
02:11:38,176 --> 02:11:39,407
"I could see..."

2791
02:11:39,407 --> 02:11:42,476
"how much he struggled during that time."

2792
02:11:43,046 --> 02:11:46,247
By the way, tears don't come easily to me.

2793
02:11:47,087 --> 02:11:48,146
It seems that way.

2794
02:11:48,146 --> 02:11:49,617
- It seems that way. - I don't cry much.

2795
02:11:49,917 --> 02:11:51,216
I felt a bit touched...

2796
02:11:51,216 --> 02:11:53,926
when I read the part about how we held hands in childhood.

2797
02:11:55,127 --> 02:11:58,926
I thought, "We were close siblings who cherished each other.'

2798
02:11:59,056 --> 02:12:01,926
Se Seung's letter talked about...

2799
02:12:01,926 --> 02:12:03,896
how proud of me she was.

2800
02:12:04,136 --> 02:12:05,296
So I didn't feel emotional.

2801
02:12:05,296 --> 02:12:08,667
I just thought, "She wrote it well. I am thankful."

2802
02:12:09,136 --> 02:12:10,936
He read it without a problem.

2803
02:12:11,537 --> 02:12:13,306
He doesn't cry much.

2804
02:12:13,976 --> 02:12:16,877
But I bet it made him feel good.

2805
02:12:17,447 --> 02:12:20,146
"Even now, he sends a selfie with his unshaven face..."

2806
02:12:20,146 --> 02:12:22,087
"and torments me by acting cute."

2807
02:12:22,087 --> 02:12:23,356
Really?

2808
02:12:23,356 --> 02:12:24,917
- Really? - You don't seem like the type.

2809
02:12:24,917 --> 02:12:25,957
I know.

2810
02:12:25,957 --> 02:12:27,587
- I want to see it. - He acts cute a lot.

2811
02:12:27,787 --> 02:12:30,657
"Jae Hyung takes good care of people in his boundaries."

2812
02:12:30,657 --> 02:12:32,426
"He is warm-hearted and wise."

2813
02:12:32,556 --> 02:12:34,627
"What do you think Jae Hyung does for a living?"

2814
02:12:34,627 --> 02:12:35,766
(What's Jae Hyung's profession?)

2815
02:12:35,766 --> 02:12:37,497
I am really curious about Jae Hyung's profession.

2816
02:12:37,497 --> 02:12:40,006
- I know. - I am so curious.

2817
02:12:40,337 --> 02:12:42,777
There was a photo of him doing vocal music.

2818
02:12:42,777 --> 02:12:45,636
So I thought, "I knew it. He is a singer."

2819
02:12:45,636 --> 02:12:48,506
I think he has a music-related profession.

2820
02:12:48,506 --> 02:12:50,976
He could be an eccentric band enthusiast...

2821
02:12:50,976 --> 02:12:52,646
- in the legal field. - That's right.

2822
02:12:52,646 --> 02:12:54,716
- That's what I think. - The legal field.

2823
02:12:55,216 --> 02:12:56,886
- Tell us. - What is it?

2824
02:12:56,886 --> 02:12:58,617
I am an accountant.

2825
02:12:58,817 --> 02:13:00,127
What?

2826
02:13:00,127 --> 02:13:01,226
I see.

2827
02:13:01,327 --> 02:13:03,827
- An accountant? That's sudden. - An accountant.

2828
02:13:03,827 --> 02:13:04,856
It's totally unexpected.

2829
02:13:04,856 --> 02:13:06,867
A beauty YouTuber was a good guess.

2830
02:13:07,296 --> 02:13:08,426
A beauty YouTuber.

2831
02:13:08,426 --> 02:13:10,136
How is an accountant so handsome?

2832
02:13:10,136 --> 02:13:11,497
- Seriously. - I know.

2833
02:13:11,497 --> 02:13:12,766
- I knew he had a specialized job. - That's incredible.

2834
02:13:12,766 --> 02:13:14,407
- Really? - Yes.

2835
02:13:14,407 --> 02:13:16,006
It's unexpected.

2836
02:13:16,476 --> 02:13:17,877
At an accounting firm,

2837
02:13:17,877 --> 02:13:20,407
I specialize in business consulting.

2838
02:13:20,407 --> 02:13:21,777
Business consulting.

2839
02:13:27,917 --> 02:13:30,787
I have worked in an accounting firm for three years.

2840
02:13:31,756 --> 02:13:34,226
- It's so unexpected. - That place is...

2841
02:13:34,587 --> 02:13:38,296
There are many accounting firms in a big building at Sinyongsan.

2842
02:13:38,596 --> 02:13:39,827
It's like "Misaeng."

2843
02:13:39,827 --> 02:13:42,466
- He is handsome. - Look at him in a suit.

2844
02:13:42,466 --> 02:13:43,596
He looks fine.

2845
02:13:43,896 --> 02:13:45,266
- He is fine. - "He looks fine."

2846
02:13:56,277 --> 02:13:59,686
The departments are audit, tax, and financial advice.

2847
02:13:59,686 --> 02:14:02,386
I work in the department of financial advice.

2848
02:14:07,556 --> 02:14:10,697
I do an assessment of value that is necessary...

2849
02:14:10,697 --> 02:14:13,527
when a company's assets are transferred.

2850
02:14:15,867 --> 02:14:19,766
(Park Jae Hyung, Accountant)

2851
02:14:20,136 --> 02:14:21,867
- He is an accountant. - How cool.

2852
02:14:23,136 --> 02:14:24,476
He is cool.

2853
02:14:24,476 --> 02:14:27,306
It's extremely hard to become an accountant.

2854
02:14:27,407 --> 02:14:30,577
In that group, how could there be such a character?

2855
02:14:30,577 --> 02:14:32,277
Among accountants, how could there be...

2856
02:14:32,277 --> 02:14:33,747
I have never seen someone like him.

2857
02:14:34,016 --> 02:14:38,056
I am sure he is someone who shines in that group.

2858
02:14:38,056 --> 02:14:40,686
They say there is madness in the clear eyes.

2859
02:14:40,686 --> 02:14:43,127
On top of that, his clear eyes are very big.

2860
02:14:43,426 --> 02:14:46,096
So they show so much more craziness.

2861
02:14:46,426 --> 02:14:49,197
He makes me wonder, "How does he do such things..."

2862
02:14:49,667 --> 02:14:51,997
"with that facial expression as if nothing is the matter?"

2863
02:14:51,997 --> 02:14:54,136
It's more fun since he is my roommate.

2864
02:14:57,476 --> 02:14:58,676
We received a message.

2865
02:14:59,306 --> 02:15:01,046
We received it right away.

2866
02:15:03,176 --> 02:15:06,386
I really didn't expect this to happen today.

2867
02:15:06,487 --> 02:15:08,947
I didn't think that the professions would be revealed so fast.

2868
02:15:08,947 --> 02:15:10,917
(On the 4th day, who made your heart flutter?)

2869
02:15:11,117 --> 02:15:12,856
We finally learned about everyone's profession.

2870
02:15:12,856 --> 02:15:14,657
(It's the first message after the profession revelation.)

2871
02:15:19,296 --> 02:15:21,197
I think there will be changes.

2872
02:15:21,197 --> 02:15:22,226
(The profession revelation will change their feelings.)

2873
02:15:22,226 --> 02:15:23,266
It's all connected.

2874
02:15:23,266 --> 02:15:24,466
There is the person's effort...

2875
02:15:24,466 --> 02:15:26,466
that went into having a certain profession.

2876
02:15:26,466 --> 02:15:27,606
- That's right. - You know,

2877
02:15:27,606 --> 02:15:30,006
- the profession defines the person. - That's right.

2878
02:15:30,006 --> 02:15:31,006
- It's true. - That's right.

2879
02:15:31,006 --> 02:15:33,447
The profession changes the type of conversations...

2880
02:15:33,447 --> 02:15:34,846
you can have.

2881
02:15:34,846 --> 02:15:36,577
- Of course. - That's right.

2882
02:15:37,016 --> 02:15:38,947
It was my first time hearing about that profession.

2883
02:15:38,947 --> 02:15:41,046
I thought, "I am really curious about this person."

2884
02:15:41,216 --> 02:15:42,686
When he said that he was a pilot,

2885
02:15:44,356 --> 02:15:45,487
I thought, "I want to get to know him."

2886
02:15:47,627 --> 02:15:49,997
I had to think about to whom I should send the message.

2887
02:15:50,327 --> 02:15:51,957
His profession was shocking.

2888
02:15:52,457 --> 02:15:54,367
I found it charming...

2889
02:15:54,596 --> 02:15:56,497
since it was unique.

2890
02:15:56,667 --> 02:15:58,436
After he revealed his profession,

2891
02:15:58,436 --> 02:16:00,907
my interest in him grew.

2892
02:16:01,006 --> 02:16:03,037
(Typing)

2893
02:16:04,377 --> 02:16:05,806
Aren't you typing too much?

2894
02:16:06,707 --> 02:16:09,506
- My goodness. - You typed so much.

2895
02:16:09,777 --> 02:16:12,016
- I am sorry. - My ears hurt.

2896
02:16:12,277 --> 02:16:13,386
My ears are sensitive.

2897
02:16:13,386 --> 02:16:15,516
- I see. - I know that you wrote, "Yong Woo."

2898
02:16:16,087 --> 02:16:17,686
Please don't make it obvious.

2899
02:16:17,686 --> 02:16:18,987
I think he wrote my name.

2900
02:16:19,587 --> 02:16:21,386
You should make a choice now.

2901
02:16:21,386 --> 02:16:24,597
I will type quietly.

2902
02:16:25,757 --> 02:16:28,526
(He delivers his feelings in a serious way.)

2903
02:16:30,036 --> 02:16:32,767
After the profession revelation,

2904
02:16:32,767 --> 02:16:35,206
I felt the charms I couldn't feel before.

2905
02:16:42,107 --> 02:16:43,747
(Glancing over)

2906
02:16:44,476 --> 02:16:46,247
Now that I know her profession,

2907
02:16:46,417 --> 02:16:48,786
I see her in a different light.

2908
02:16:49,017 --> 02:16:52,187
There are things I want to talk about with her.

2909
02:16:52,317 --> 02:16:54,556
So I thought hard.

2910
02:16:55,126 --> 02:16:56,556
This is hard.

2911
02:16:59,157 --> 02:17:00,267
I am nervous.

2912
02:17:00,267 --> 02:17:01,466
(Cheol Hyeon made a choice first.)

2913
02:17:01,767 --> 02:17:04,466
(Glancing over)

2914
02:17:04,667 --> 02:17:05,737
I thought about it for a long time.

2915
02:17:05,737 --> 02:17:08,237
I bet I was the last person to make a choice.

2916
02:17:08,966 --> 02:17:11,337
(Some sent a message after much consideration.)

2917
02:17:11,337 --> 02:17:13,546
(Others sent a message without hesitation.)

2918
02:17:16,677 --> 02:17:18,577
(They delivered their feelings.)

2919
02:17:18,577 --> 02:17:20,847
- This is fun. - This is really fun.

2920
02:17:20,847 --> 02:17:22,187
This photo...

2921
02:17:22,347 --> 02:17:24,886
- I wanted to ask about it. - Did you take it at the company?

2922
02:17:24,886 --> 02:17:26,556
I took it before a job interview.

2923
02:17:26,726 --> 02:17:28,157
- I see. - I see.

2924
02:17:28,157 --> 02:17:29,386
- It was a feint. - It's an old photo.

2925
02:17:29,386 --> 02:17:31,396
Your hair looks very neat.

2926
02:17:31,396 --> 02:17:32,597
This is the photo that got you the job..

2927
02:17:32,597 --> 02:17:33,827
even before the job interview,

2928
02:17:34,366 --> 02:17:35,497
right?

2929
02:17:35,497 --> 02:17:36,966
- "You passed." - Thank you.

2930
02:17:37,567 --> 02:17:38,636
Already...

2931
02:17:39,737 --> 02:17:43,937
Seriously, she looked so pretty.

2932
02:17:44,206 --> 02:17:47,077
(One person chose your sibling.)

2933
02:17:47,206 --> 02:17:50,276
(Would you share your opinion on my stomach and sides...)

2934
02:17:50,276 --> 02:17:52,347
(that got attacked by fat?)

2935
02:17:52,716 --> 02:17:56,587
(Who sent a message to your older sister?)

2936
02:17:56,817 --> 02:17:59,216
I think it's Jung Sub.

2937
02:17:59,456 --> 02:18:00,827
Whenever we ate...

2938
02:18:00,827 --> 02:18:03,526
or had a short conversation,

2939
02:18:03,796 --> 02:18:07,126
I had a feeling that Jung Sub had an interest.

2940
02:18:07,526 --> 02:18:09,567
So I think Jung Sub sent the message.

2941
02:18:12,337 --> 02:18:15,206
But if I could choose a date for my older sister,

2942
02:18:15,706 --> 02:18:19,036
I would choose Yong Woo.

2943
02:18:19,206 --> 02:18:22,546
Yesterday, we gathered around and spent a lot of time together.

2944
02:18:22,706 --> 02:18:25,817
Yong Woo and my sister...

2945
02:18:26,276 --> 02:18:29,116
had a conversation back then.

2946
02:18:29,116 --> 02:18:31,056
- Is it good? - You look like a shadow.

2947
02:18:31,757 --> 02:18:33,886
- A shadow. - Do I look like a shadow?

2948
02:18:34,587 --> 02:18:36,827
I watched them out of the corner of my eye...

2949
02:18:37,927 --> 02:18:40,667
and thought, "This is nice."

2950
02:18:41,667 --> 02:18:43,536
Although I like Yong Woo more,

2951
02:18:44,296 --> 02:18:47,007
Jung Sub seems like a really nice person too.

2952
02:18:47,667 --> 02:18:50,337
(A neck-and-neck match to decide on his brother-in-law)

2953
02:18:50,706 --> 02:18:52,476
(Would you share your opinion on my stomach and sides...)

2954
02:18:52,476 --> 02:18:53,876
(that got attacked by fat?)

2955
02:18:54,107 --> 02:18:59,417
(Who sent a message to Cho A?)

2956
02:18:59,847 --> 02:19:01,146
I think it's Yong Woo.

2957
02:19:01,917 --> 02:19:05,757
"Yong Woo is the only one who would show such wits."

2958
02:19:05,757 --> 02:19:07,286
I had that thought.

2959
02:19:07,786 --> 02:19:09,386
I sent it to Cho A.

2960
02:19:10,126 --> 02:19:12,456
I still have lingering emotions...

2961
02:19:12,456 --> 02:19:14,896
from the first date we had last night.

2962
02:19:15,267 --> 02:19:17,097
I want to describe them as "Colours."

2963
02:19:17,636 --> 02:19:19,267
They still linger.

2964
02:19:19,567 --> 02:19:22,966
Cho A's fragrance and colours still linger.

2965
02:19:22,966 --> 02:19:24,177
I want to put it that way.

2966
02:19:24,876 --> 02:19:27,206
Seriously, she looked...

2967
02:19:27,206 --> 02:19:28,446
so pretty.

2968
02:19:34,487 --> 02:19:36,386
(I see why you are smart. Now that I know your profession,)

2969
02:19:36,386 --> 02:19:38,757
(our conversations will be more relaxed and fun.)

2970
02:19:39,956 --> 02:19:43,497
(Who do you think sent the message?)

2971
02:19:43,497 --> 02:19:44,497
Jung Sub.

2972
02:19:45,857 --> 02:19:47,026
He said "more."

2973
02:19:47,726 --> 02:19:49,866
Jung Sub is the one I have talked to.

2974
02:19:49,866 --> 02:19:52,136
He seemed to feel relieved.

2975
02:19:52,136 --> 02:19:53,437
"Finally, I know."

2976
02:19:53,837 --> 02:19:55,866
He muttered the profession to himself.

2977
02:19:55,866 --> 02:19:57,177
"A business consultant."

2978
02:19:57,607 --> 02:20:01,007
I worked as a management strategy consultant.

2979
02:20:01,446 --> 02:20:02,806
- Consulting? - A consultant.

2980
02:20:02,806 --> 02:20:04,976
- Yes, a strategy consultant. - Consultant.

2981
02:20:05,446 --> 02:20:06,946
I sent it to Se Seung.

2982
02:20:07,286 --> 02:20:10,956
I thought Se Seung was smart.

2983
02:20:11,257 --> 02:20:12,517
(Yesterday, Cupid Date)

2984
02:20:12,517 --> 02:20:14,927
I wonder what you do for a living.

2985
02:20:15,126 --> 02:20:16,257
You seem smart.

2986
02:20:17,226 --> 02:20:20,696
On top of that, she studied data science in graduate school.

2987
02:20:20,866 --> 02:20:22,597
Our fields are very similar,

2988
02:20:22,966 --> 02:20:24,396
so I became curious.

2989
02:20:25,366 --> 02:20:27,167
I didn't hear it.

2990
02:20:28,167 --> 02:20:29,206
I didn't hear it.

2991
02:20:29,206 --> 02:20:31,136
(I became more curious about you. I want to ask you many things.)

2992
02:20:32,337 --> 02:20:33,677
I sent it to Jung Sub.

2993
02:20:34,306 --> 02:20:36,646
There is one more thing we can talk about,

2994
02:20:36,646 --> 02:20:38,216
so I can't wait to talk to him.

2995
02:20:38,376 --> 02:20:40,187
During Cupid Date,

2996
02:20:40,347 --> 02:20:41,587
we talked a lot about...

2997
02:20:41,587 --> 02:20:44,987
wanting to know each other in depth once we gained more information.

2998
02:20:45,056 --> 02:20:49,526
Se Seung is the only one who can send such a message.

2999
02:20:49,896 --> 02:20:51,997
Now that the professions have been revealed...

3000
02:20:52,327 --> 02:20:53,497
We can talk about them now.

3001
02:20:53,667 --> 02:20:55,497
- I feel more at ease. - Same here.

3002
02:20:55,767 --> 02:20:59,466
It's fascinating that we got the people's many facets.

3003
02:20:59,767 --> 02:21:01,667
Everyone is charming.

3004
02:21:05,306 --> 02:21:09,607
(You are even cooler than I thought. Thank you for the ice cream.)

3005
02:21:16,046 --> 02:21:17,757
I think it's from Cho A.

3006
02:21:18,456 --> 02:21:21,357
Cho A wasn't there, so I set aside...

3007
02:21:21,786 --> 02:21:23,026
some ice cream.

3008
02:21:23,456 --> 02:21:27,796
Perhaps she liked the considerate gesture.

3009
02:21:28,097 --> 02:21:29,597
On the first date,

3010
02:21:29,866 --> 02:21:33,237
I told him that I like pepper very much.

3011
02:21:33,567 --> 02:21:37,776
That day, he gave me ice cream with pepper...

3012
02:21:37,776 --> 02:21:39,107
and olive oil.

3013
02:21:40,747 --> 02:21:43,376
(Yong Woo and Cho A chose each other.)

3014
02:21:43,376 --> 02:21:46,847
(Se Seung and Jung Sub also chose each other.)

3015
02:21:47,216 --> 02:21:50,386
Personally, I really want to hear you play the cello.

3016
02:21:50,386 --> 02:21:52,017
- Seriously. - I will let you hear it.

3017
02:21:52,187 --> 02:21:53,687
I will invite you to my concert.

3018
02:21:53,827 --> 02:21:54,886
I would love that.

3019
02:21:54,886 --> 02:21:58,097
During a jazz performance...

3020
02:21:58,097 --> 02:22:00,067
- I don't know it very well, - Do you do classical music?

3021
02:22:00,067 --> 02:22:01,726
- but I love classical music. - I don't do jazz music.

3022
02:22:01,726 --> 02:22:02,927
I do classical music.

3023
02:22:02,927 --> 02:22:04,896
At times, I check out Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra.

3024
02:22:05,136 --> 02:22:06,196
- Really? - Yes.

3025
02:22:06,536 --> 02:22:08,437
- No way. - Perhaps you have seen her.

3026
02:22:08,937 --> 02:22:11,206
I don't know much about classical music, but I go.

3027
02:22:11,607 --> 02:22:13,946
That was a good line. You should try it some other time.

3028
02:22:13,946 --> 02:22:15,247
(Musicians are cool. Just as expected, you were cool.)

3029
02:22:15,247 --> 02:22:16,577
(Let's become get closer.)

3030
02:22:19,476 --> 02:22:21,146
"Musicians are cool."

3031
02:22:21,747 --> 02:22:23,556
I sent a message along that line.

3032
02:22:23,956 --> 02:22:26,757
She looked very cool.

3033
02:22:30,157 --> 02:22:33,526
(Please enjoy the book.)

3034
02:22:33,526 --> 02:22:36,167
I sent a message to Ju Yeon.

3035
02:22:36,597 --> 02:22:40,167
I spent time with Ju Yeon,

3036
02:22:40,306 --> 02:22:42,866
so I wanted to talk to her more.

3037
02:22:44,107 --> 02:22:45,636
That's what I think.

3038
02:22:46,376 --> 02:22:47,376
My goodness.

3039
02:22:50,177 --> 02:22:51,476
You are right.

3040
02:22:51,476 --> 02:22:53,116
Like a bard.

3041
02:22:53,917 --> 02:22:54,987
Like a bard.

3042
02:22:54,987 --> 02:22:56,716
(Looking around)

3043
02:22:56,716 --> 02:22:57,716
That's interesting.

3044
02:23:00,886 --> 02:23:03,456
(The wine is so tasty. We enjoyed it.)

3045
02:23:07,497 --> 02:23:09,396
(It's nice to see your condition improve.)

3046
02:23:09,396 --> 02:23:11,167
(Please play the guitar when your hands heal.)

3047
02:23:12,097 --> 02:23:13,706
That's right. It changed.

3048
02:23:13,706 --> 02:23:15,067
I got goosebumps.

3049
02:23:15,067 --> 02:23:16,536
Did he receive two messages?

3050
02:23:17,677 --> 02:23:20,046
I initially thought 1 person had sent 2 messages.

3051
02:23:21,046 --> 02:23:24,247
The messages came consecutively,

3052
02:23:24,247 --> 02:23:28,247
so I thought, "This person wrote two messages."

3053
02:23:28,386 --> 02:23:29,917
But there were two messages.

3054
02:23:30,017 --> 02:23:31,157
Then I realized that they were two separate messages.

3055
02:23:31,417 --> 02:23:34,026
(Who sent the messages?)

3056
02:23:34,556 --> 02:23:35,786
I couldn't guess the senders.

3057
02:23:35,786 --> 02:23:39,427
Ju Yeon was the only one I interacted with.

3058
02:23:39,556 --> 02:23:41,296
I thought Ju Yeon hated me.

3059
02:23:41,296 --> 02:23:43,267
I thought she didn't like me very much.

3060
02:23:43,737 --> 02:23:45,597
(Dinnertime a bit earlier)

3061
02:23:45,597 --> 02:23:47,767
I bought it. Do you want it?

3062
02:23:47,937 --> 02:23:49,806
- What is it? Wine? - Yes.

3063
02:23:50,806 --> 02:23:52,036
Do you want it?

3064
02:23:52,036 --> 02:23:53,376
- I am okay. - Is that so?

3065
02:23:53,546 --> 02:23:55,247
- I am going to drink it. - Go ahead.

3066
02:23:55,247 --> 02:23:59,517
I thought, "Does she dislike me?"

3067
02:23:59,646 --> 02:24:02,786
I had no interactions with Cho A.

3068
02:24:03,116 --> 02:24:04,616
It couldn't have been Se Seung.

3069
02:24:04,616 --> 02:24:06,286
Then two people remained.

3070
02:24:07,056 --> 02:24:10,497
Ju Yeon was the person I first drank wine with...

3071
02:24:10,796 --> 02:24:13,866
No. I drank alone at first.

3072
02:24:14,167 --> 02:24:15,767
I drank alone when we ate meat.

3073
02:24:16,267 --> 02:24:17,796
Then who sent the message?

3074
02:24:18,767 --> 02:24:19,896
Who sent the message?

3075
02:24:24,837 --> 02:24:27,107
He bought wine.

3076
02:24:27,306 --> 02:24:29,577
It was very tasty,

3077
02:24:30,116 --> 02:24:32,146
so I sent him a message to say thank you.

3078
02:24:32,317 --> 02:24:35,187
I saw Jae Hyung's new sides.

3079
02:24:35,546 --> 02:24:37,817
He cooked rice and grilled pork belly.

3080
02:24:38,357 --> 02:24:39,886
It made me become interested.

3081
02:24:39,886 --> 02:24:42,626
When he revealed his profession,

3082
02:24:42,786 --> 02:24:45,257
I bet women found him incredibly charming.

3083
02:24:45,497 --> 02:24:48,366
- Everyone has a nice profession. - Yes.

3084
02:24:48,366 --> 02:24:51,036
It isn't about that. He had an unexpected side.

3085
02:24:51,036 --> 02:24:52,267
- That's right. - Jae Hyung had that.

3086
02:24:52,267 --> 02:24:54,507
- That's right. - An accountant was so unexpected.

3087
02:24:54,507 --> 02:24:56,407
The two sides are the exact opposites.

3088
02:24:56,607 --> 02:24:58,177
The man who was singing to a wall...

3089
02:24:58,177 --> 02:24:59,636
turned out to be an accountant.

3090
02:24:59,937 --> 02:25:01,907
"What's up with him? I want to get to know him."

3091
02:25:01,907 --> 02:25:03,446
- Women became curious. - That's right.

3092
02:25:03,446 --> 02:25:06,347
He might be the most multi-talented man there.

3093
02:25:06,347 --> 02:25:07,946
- That's right. - He does music and...

3094
02:25:08,046 --> 02:25:09,347
You can't look down on Jae Hyung.

3095
02:25:09,817 --> 02:25:11,716
(How did it feel to receive 2 messages?)

3096
02:25:11,716 --> 02:25:12,786
It felt nice.

3097
02:25:12,786 --> 02:25:14,687
(Laughing)

3098
02:25:15,987 --> 02:25:18,456
You were chosen by half of the women.

3099
02:25:19,196 --> 02:25:20,497
Actually, it was 2-3rds.

3100
02:25:21,497 --> 02:25:22,497
My goodness.

3101
02:25:23,097 --> 02:25:24,237
Please be precise.

3102
02:25:24,237 --> 02:25:26,097
(The accountant is good with numbers.)

3103
02:25:27,337 --> 02:25:29,306
My sibling got two messages.

3104
02:25:29,607 --> 02:25:31,107
Why did I even worry about him?

3105
02:25:31,376 --> 02:25:34,046
I laughed because I was incredulous.

3106
02:25:37,546 --> 02:25:38,776
At that rate, it's like,

3107
02:25:39,177 --> 02:25:41,747
"I didn't want him to be that happy."

3108
02:25:41,747 --> 02:25:42,786
That's right.

3109
02:25:43,446 --> 02:25:44,687
- That's right. - That's right.

3110
02:25:44,687 --> 02:25:47,087
- "I worried about you," - Look at her face.

3111
02:25:47,087 --> 02:25:49,187
- "but this wasn't what I wanted." - That's right.

3112
02:25:49,187 --> 02:25:50,757
- Right. - "This is too much."

3113
02:25:52,396 --> 02:25:54,126
"I didn't want him to be that happy."

3114
02:25:54,126 --> 02:25:55,167
That's so precise.

3115
02:25:56,667 --> 02:25:58,796
Why am I not getting any messages? I keep hearing the sounds.

3116
02:25:59,696 --> 02:26:01,237
I guess they come in an order.

3117
02:26:01,767 --> 02:26:03,036
Shall I send you one?

3118
02:26:09,976 --> 02:26:11,017
- Oh, no. - Don't say that.

3119
02:26:11,017 --> 02:26:12,017
My goodness.

3120
02:26:12,276 --> 02:26:13,817
What is Ju Yeon going to do?

3121
02:26:15,187 --> 02:26:16,446
After sending the message,

3122
02:26:16,446 --> 02:26:18,417
I couldn't look Cheol Hyeon in the eye.

3123
02:26:19,357 --> 02:26:21,687
Cheol Hyeon sent me a message,

3124
02:26:22,386 --> 02:26:26,026
but I didn't reciprocate.

3125
02:26:26,296 --> 02:26:28,026
- When was it taken? - When I was studying.

3126
02:26:30,866 --> 02:26:33,196
"All messages have been sent. Have a good night."

3127
02:26:35,337 --> 02:26:37,177
- Good night. - Good night.

3128
02:26:37,976 --> 02:26:39,036
Good night.

3129
02:26:39,036 --> 02:26:40,077
- Good night. - Good night.

3130
02:26:43,847 --> 02:26:46,077
- This is fun. - This is fun.

3131
02:26:47,146 --> 02:26:48,487
What's so fun?

3132
02:26:48,487 --> 02:26:50,286
- This is fun. - I know.

3133
02:26:53,116 --> 02:26:54,286
Cheol Hyeon said,

3134
02:26:55,427 --> 02:26:57,956
"This is fun." I couldn't help but wonder...

3135
02:26:58,796 --> 02:27:00,466
if it was meant for me.

3136
02:27:04,196 --> 02:27:08,767
It made me wonder if Ju Yeon felt disappointed.

3137
02:27:08,966 --> 02:27:12,577
Ju Yeon and I didn't have a conflict,

3138
02:27:12,706 --> 02:27:16,146
so I wondered why Ju Yeon didn't send a message.

3139
02:27:16,376 --> 02:27:19,616
I bought books for other people too.

3140
02:27:20,446 --> 02:27:21,817
This is for you, Se Seung.

3141
02:27:22,417 --> 02:27:23,786
It suits you.

3142
02:27:24,216 --> 02:27:26,157
"He communicated with me."

3143
02:27:26,157 --> 02:27:28,487
"Why did he give a book to all the women?"

3144
02:27:29,026 --> 02:27:31,396
I felt that vibe from her, but I thought I was mistaken.

3145
02:27:31,396 --> 02:27:34,427
But since I didn't get a message, that might be the case.

3146
02:27:34,526 --> 02:27:36,927
I gave the newest book to Ju Yeon.

3147
02:27:37,167 --> 02:27:39,036
It had a deep meaning.

3148
02:27:39,437 --> 02:27:40,636
Perhaps it wasn't conveyed to her.

3149
02:27:40,636 --> 02:27:43,907
Perhaps that was why she didn't send the message. I had that thought.

3150
02:27:44,177 --> 02:27:46,946
It wasn't that I came to dislike Cheol Hyeon.

3151
02:27:47,146 --> 02:27:50,876
I chose the person who made my heart flutter the most.

3152
02:27:51,917 --> 02:27:54,087
I am in a bit of a confused state.

3153
02:27:55,247 --> 02:27:57,157
I don't know what Ju Yeon is thinking.

3154
02:27:57,456 --> 02:27:59,187
But it didn't feel good.

3155
02:28:01,187 --> 02:28:02,257
That's right.
