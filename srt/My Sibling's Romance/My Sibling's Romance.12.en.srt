1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,239
(Jae Hyung and Ju Yeon: Shall we go?)

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,310
(Let's go.)

3
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:07,178
(The date continued until the evening.)

4
00:00:07,179 --> 00:00:11,518
(There were moments where we were silent for a few minutes.)

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,859
(We might not get along in some aspects.)

6
00:00:14,989 --> 00:00:19,989
(His firm feelings started to waver.)

7
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:23,799
(I thought you said a lot of things that gave me assurance.)

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,299
(That wasn't the case at all.)

9
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,929
(You weren't sure.)

10
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,299
(I decided to trust you, no matter what.)

11
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,369
(You should trust me too.)

12
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:31,399
(Trust what?)

13
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,808
(Me)

14
00:00:32,809 --> 00:00:35,779
(They understood and trusted each other that night.)

15
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,948
(A letter arrived on the first day of the trip.)

16
00:00:38,949 --> 00:00:41,308
(Five days from the final choice)

17
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:44,778
(Women choose their date.)

18
00:00:44,779 --> 00:00:49,120
(After the siblings discuss, the date is finalized.)

19
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:51,729
(Ji Won and Ju Yeon chose you.)

20
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:55,358
(Why did Ji Won choose me?)

21
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:56,528
(I think...)

22
00:00:56,529 --> 00:00:58,198
(it's Jae Hyung.)

23
00:00:58,199 --> 00:00:59,869
(He's the person that I'm most curious about.)

24
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:02,039
(And he's cute.)

25
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,498
(Yong Woo is my only choice.)

26
00:01:04,499 --> 00:01:06,969
(So two of you can make more happy memories?)

27
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:10,239
(The decision is made after thinking hard about it.)

28
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,048
(Cho A and Yong Woo will go on a date.)

29
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:15,879
(Yun Ha and Yun Jae will go on a date.)

30
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,619
(Se Seung and Jung Sub will go on a date.)

31
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:22,219
(Ji Won and Jae Hyung will go on a date.)

32
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:25,590
(The second date started in Singapore.)

33
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,059
(Nervous)

34
00:01:29,059 --> 00:01:31,769
(I thought he was really fun and cute.)

35
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,668
(I got to talk with you now,)

36
00:01:33,669 --> 00:01:36,468
(so there isn't anybody else that I want to talk with.)

37
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:40,669
(Ji Won and Jae Hyung got closer to each other.)

38
00:01:45,949 --> 00:01:47,010
Have fun.

39
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,849
We'll get going.

40
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:50,419
- Bye. - Bye.

41
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,049
Did you get a mosquito bite?

42
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,650
- Not yet. - Not yet?

43
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:55,589
- I brought the spray. - You did?

44
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,620
Let's spray it when we get there.

45
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,930
Get in.

46
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,189
Okay.

47
00:02:01,559 --> 00:02:04,860
(Yun Ha and Yun Jae start their date.)

48
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,770
(Yun Ha and Yun Jae, selected date)

49
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,670
(Patricia, Jonathan)

50
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,840
This is good.

51
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,568
I've been to that bird park.

52
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:16,609
Is that place famous for birds?

53
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:18,008
There's an outdoor bird park.

54
00:02:18,009 --> 00:02:19,009
(Amazed)

55
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:20,579
So it's a huge bird cage.

56
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,749
That's right.

57
00:02:21,779 --> 00:02:22,949
I wonder what it's like.

58
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,818
(They get on the tram.)

59
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:26,249
This isn't much, but it's so fun.

60
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:27,890
It feels like I'm in my 20s.

61
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,960
It's already fun.

62
00:02:30,789 --> 00:02:32,090
I think we've arrived.

63
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,460
That was short.

64
00:02:34,559 --> 00:02:35,830
It's too short.

65
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:40,370
Let's go.

66
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:42,839
Do you want to put your bag in mine?

67
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,899
It's okay.

68
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,008
- It's okay? - Yes.

69
00:02:45,009 --> 00:02:46,140
Is there space?

70
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,039
- Yes, my bag's very empty. - Really?

71
00:02:49,279 --> 00:02:50,839
You can take it out whenever you need something.

72
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,950
Really?

73
00:02:52,809 --> 00:02:54,849
- Thank you. - Focus on looking around.

74
00:02:57,979 --> 00:03:01,149
(Bird Paradise: The biggest wild bird park in Asia)

75
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,860
(You can see 400 species and 3,500 birds freely.)

76
00:03:09,029 --> 00:03:10,159
My goodness.

77
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:12,529
They're all pink.

78
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:13,900
I get to see them in real life.

79
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:15,200
That's my favourite bird.

80
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,539
- Look at their legs. - Exactly. They're so long.

81
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,069
They're like Yun Jae.

82
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:23,979
- Amazing. - That's so huge.

83
00:03:25,249 --> 00:03:26,650
That's such a beautiful colour.

84
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,859
- That... - What is it?

85
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,690
Why?

86
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,560
Gosh.

87
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:18,429
They seem angry.

88
00:04:18,669 --> 00:04:19,900
This is so funny.

89
00:04:21,669 --> 00:04:24,038
- My goodness. - That place is awesome.

90
00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:25,538
There are so many types of birds.

91
00:04:25,539 --> 00:04:26,739
I feel like I'm travelling too through the monitor.

92
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,510
My gosh, that startled me.

93
00:04:31,109 --> 00:04:32,950
I got surprised because it cawed above my head.

94
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,609
(Cawing)

95
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,179
Why are they shouting?

96
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:38,519
(Surprised)

97
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,520
What is it?

98
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:43,190
It's pitch black like Ji Won.

99
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,659
That's the epitome of Africa.

100
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:51,299
- It has such a big beak. - It's so pretty.

101
00:04:53,929 --> 00:04:55,570
I think it's drinking water.

102
00:05:01,469 --> 00:05:03,880
You're communicating with it.

103
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,278
Gosh, what are you doing?

104
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:11,848
Are you going to fly at me?

105
00:05:11,849 --> 00:05:13,590
(Staying far away)

106
00:05:14,219 --> 00:05:16,659
Let's take a selfie with this bird.

107
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:20,060
- If we can. - You're brave.

108
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:23,429
Here, quickly.

109
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,469
It's looking at us.

110
00:05:36,179 --> 00:05:37,609
I want to go there.

111
00:05:37,779 --> 00:05:38,779
Be careful.

112
00:05:39,049 --> 00:05:40,150
It keeps looking at us.

113
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,650
It keeps looking at us.

114
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:44,650
Up close, it doesn't look that good.

115
00:05:46,549 --> 00:05:47,989
But it has a very pretty colour.

116
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,658
How do the eyes have such a colour...

117
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:50,760
My gosh!

118
00:05:52,789 --> 00:05:54,130
My gosh!

119
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,460
Up close, it doesn't look that good.

120
00:05:59,299 --> 00:06:00,799
But it has a very pretty colour.

121
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,468
How do the eyes have such a colour...

122
00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:03,640
My gosh!

123
00:06:05,609 --> 00:06:06,738
My gosh!

124
00:06:06,739 --> 00:06:08,469
(Yun Ha runs away.)

125
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,179
That startled me.

126
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:13,750
It understood him.

127
00:06:14,679 --> 00:06:16,048
- It must've understood him. - They understand...

128
00:06:16,049 --> 00:06:17,380
when you badmouth them.

129
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:19,590
It's following him.

130
00:06:20,219 --> 00:06:21,858
It sat on me.

131
00:06:21,859 --> 00:06:22,918
(An animal communicator)

132
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:24,019
How shocking.

133
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,659
What's wrong with them?

134
00:06:26,659 --> 00:06:29,159
- No, they like us too much. - I think they like us.

135
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,799
- There's one more on the left. - My goodness!

136
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,700
I don't like them now.

137
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:36,739
Honestly, I was scared.

138
00:06:37,239 --> 00:06:39,969
I didn't expect to communicate with them so much.

139
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,140
You abandoned me so coolly.

140
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:46,380
I could not protect you no matter how.

141
00:06:47,049 --> 00:06:49,418
I think only I had a bird sit on my back today.

142
00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:50,650
I'm the chosen one.

143
00:06:51,049 --> 00:06:53,590
(The house in Singapore)

144
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,820
Do you want some on your arm?

145
00:06:55,989 --> 00:06:58,060
- Really? - Will your bracelets be fine?

146
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:01,330
(Amazed)

147
00:07:01,331 --> 00:07:02,529
You need to put on a lot.

148
00:07:03,529 --> 00:07:05,098
This is like lotion,

149
00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:06,668
- so it shouldn't be too sticky. - Thank you.

150
00:07:06,669 --> 00:07:08,669
- Do you want me to do it for you? - Yes.

151
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,169
It's as if...

152
00:07:10,669 --> 00:07:13,070
- you were asking your mom for help. - Mom, help me.

153
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:15,710
(Making a U-turn)

154
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:19,979
- I'm so hairy. - You're so hairy.

155
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:23,218
- Have fun. - See you.

156
00:07:23,219 --> 00:07:24,279
How was your sleep?

157
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:27,418
Yes, I was knocked out downstairs.

158
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:28,548
How do you sleep so well?

159
00:07:28,549 --> 00:07:30,959
You sleep well anywhere.

160
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,789
Yes, I sleep too well.

161
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,629
I went out thinking that I should...

162
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:38,358
organize my thoughts well and communicate with her.

163
00:07:38,359 --> 00:07:41,228
The feelings that I felt yesterday might change after going out today.

164
00:07:41,229 --> 00:07:42,238
That's how humans work.

165
00:07:42,239 --> 00:07:44,169
I just wanted to go out with her for another day.

166
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,339
Instead of talking,

167
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,668
- I hope they do some activities. - Yes, today,

168
00:07:47,669 --> 00:07:49,640
- I hope they just have fun. - That's right.

169
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:51,210
I'll get in from that side.

170
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,218
- Hello. - Hi.

171
00:07:56,219 --> 00:07:57,380
Hi, good afternoon.

172
00:07:57,679 --> 00:08:00,419
(Cho A and Yong Woo start their date.)

173
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:05,358
Take care of me today.

174
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:07,929
- Do you want me to take the lead? - Yes, take the lead today.

175
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,159
We can go on four things.

176
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:13,229
Kayaks, stand up paddle boards,

177
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,270
a donut ride, and a banana boat.

178
00:08:16,369 --> 00:08:18,239
Let's ride the stand up paddle boats...

179
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,170
and between a banana boat and a donut ride,

180
00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:21,570
let's choose what we want to eat more.

181
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,210
What we crave, what looks delicious.

182
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:26,550
Cool.

183
00:08:28,109 --> 00:08:30,619
I cooked some eggs to eat.

184
00:08:31,019 --> 00:08:32,349
You smelled it and came down.

185
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:37,190
You have a very sharp nose.

186
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,259
Didn't you prepare it for me?

187
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:41,759
I did.

188
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,160
- It's... - You're quick to catch on too.

189
00:08:51,139 --> 00:08:52,639
(The conversation is cut off.)

190
00:08:53,139 --> 00:08:54,608
Here's what I felt.

191
00:08:54,609 --> 00:08:59,309
Yong Woo normally talked a lot,

192
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:01,280
but he was rather quiet on the way there.

193
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:03,978
There were a few moments...

194
00:09:03,979 --> 00:09:06,988
that I thought he was with me physically...

195
00:09:06,989 --> 00:09:08,149
but was thinking about something else.

196
00:09:08,349 --> 00:09:11,460
It felt like we both were trying.

(Se Seung and Jung Sub, Bukit Timah Railway Station)

211
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,710
- It's perfect for a stroll. - Exactly.

212
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:35,478
- Do you see that yellow tram? - Yes, I see it.

213
00:10:35,479 --> 00:10:36,508
(Yellow trams between the green nature)

214
00:10:36,509 --> 00:10:38,340
This is amazing.

215
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,780
- It's pretty. - It really is.

216
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:44,050
It's this kind of vibe.

217
00:10:48,619 --> 00:10:49,759
Good.

218
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,219
One, two.

219
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,300
- It's funny. It looks nice. - The picture looks nice.

220

One, two.

221
00:10:59,369 --> 00:11:00,429
I think it'll look nice.

222
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:01,469
(It looks like she's dancing.)

223
00:11:01,729 --> 00:11:02,739
Jung Sub, go stand there too.

224
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:05,239
One, two, three.

225
00:11:06,509 --> 00:11:08,509
- This is a good one. - Really?

226
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,440
I want to ask someone to take a picture for us.

227
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:13,580
- And this one is the button. - This is the button, okay.

228
00:11:17,249 --> 00:11:18,920
Aren't they so cute?

229
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:25,789

232
00:11:29,099 --> 00:11:30,330
Shouldn't we hold hands?

Gently?

234
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,269
He took it.

235
00:11:36,999 --> 00:11:38,170
Thank you.

236
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:41,139
- So good. - Thank you so much.

237
00:11:41,239 --> 00:11:42,539
Bye.

238
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,210

- It's nice. - Right now.

241

It's a vivid scene.

242
00:12:05,969 --> 00:12:07,999
- Are they fighting? - They just fought.

243
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,169
- That's how they fight. - Calm down.

Two cocks are keeping each other in check...

247
00:12:17,979 --> 00:12:19,310

who has a higher hierarchy.

249
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,680
Fighting.

250
00:12:24,979 --> 00:12:27,050
It looks like a dance.

00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:29,858
(The audience is deeply engrossed.)

252
00:12:29,859 --> 00:12:33,229

Nobody's answering.

256

Hey.

259
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:51,309
Come on, you're annoying.

260
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:52,379
It's fun.

261
00:12:55,009 --> 00:12:56,719
I took a picture of my brother swimming.

262
00:12:57,749 --> 00:13:01,590

263
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,089
- He's like a dog. - What?

264
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:06,790
He looks like a dog swimming.

265
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,460
Hold on.

266
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,359
She said he looked like a dog.

267
00:13:13,369 --> 00:13:15,029
- He's like a dog. - What?

268
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,768
He looks like a dog swimming.

269
00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:18,968
- He's born in the year of the dog. - He's like a dog.

270
00:13:18,969 --> 00:13:20,508
Yes, doesn't he look like a dog?

271
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:22,280
- Or a seal? - A bit, yes.

272
00:13:22,479 --> 00:13:23,479

273
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:25,039
- Yes? - Thank you.

274
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,679
- For what? - It's hot,

275
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,449
- No, I'm having so much fun. - but you help me take pictures.

276
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:31,719
- No, I like taking pictures. - And you didn't complain.

277
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:34,488
Jung Sub sweated so much.

278
00:13:34,489 --> 00:13:37,159
But even while he was feeling hot, he kept saying he was okay...

279
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,988
and taking pictures of me.

280
00:13:38,989 --> 00:13:42,029
So I felt sorry and grateful.

281
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,060
I was moved.

282
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:45,258
"I should take pictures of her."

283
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:47,670
I made her stand here and there.

284
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:51,899
I tried to express my feelings in that way.

285
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,780
Jung Sub looked like he was in a movie.

286
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,940
He looked very refreshed.

287
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:00,249
(Jung Sub's point of view)

288
00:14:00,479 --> 00:14:02,820
It became really pretty now, right?

289
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,180
You're right.

290
00:14:06,119 --> 00:14:08,589
- I had fun. - Yes.

291
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:10,420
- Me too. - Me too.

292
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:12,190
Right? Is it over there?

293
00:14:13,859 --> 00:14:16,300
- It's like a theme park. - You're right.

294
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,099
Are you excited?

295
00:14:18,729 --> 00:14:20,670
It's nice to be on a vacation for the first time in a while.

296
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:22,499
It's the sea.

297
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,040
It really is.

298
00:14:24,139 --> 00:14:26,210
- It's the sea. - It's connected to the sea.

299
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,509
Exactly.

304
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,388
Don't hold here?

305
00:14:42,389 --> 00:14:45,160
Don't do this. Do this.

306
00:14:45,489 --> 00:14:47,128
Like this.

307
00:14:47,129 --> 00:14:48,629
Low, like this.

308
00:14:52,369 --> 00:14:53,899
- Let's go? - Go.

309
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,410
The donut might jump up at this rate.

310
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:04,710
That'll be fun.

311
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,950

(Screaming)

314

- It's so fun. - This is so fun.

315
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:27,269
Let's not fall off.

316
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:29,469
(As soon as she says that, they face a risky moment.)

317
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,449
It ends once they fall off.

318
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:43,450
It's fun.

319
00:15:43,451 --> 00:15:45,348
I think Yong Woo wanted something fun like this.

320
00:15:45,349 --> 00:15:47,319
Yes, I think he wanted something like this.

321
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,460

You're good.

325
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,349
Am I good?

326
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:16,549
You must've ridden it often.

327
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:18,748
I ride this to work.

328
00:16:18,749 --> 00:16:21,719
I heard that someone saw a person riding a paddle board in Han River.

329
00:16:21,889 --> 00:16:23,060
That's me.

330
00:16:26,889 --> 00:16:28,690
Don't go too far to that side.

331
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,300
Cho A, come slightly to this side.

332
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:33,129
I'll go there.

333
00:16:33,369 --> 00:16:36,170
- It's a bit iffy to turn that side. - Yes.

334
00:16:36,969 --> 00:16:38,569
Let's turn in front there.

335
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,540
- Where? - It's very scary.

336
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:42,340
Are we going back?

337
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:43,939
- What? - Are we going back?

338
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,609
It's better to go back. Why? Do you want to go there?

339
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:46,710
No.

340
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,209
I want to reach the buoy.

341
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:50,319
You want to reach the buoy? Let's go.

342
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,878
- Shall we go? - We can go.

343
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:53,989
We wanted to go to the buoy and come back,

344
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:55,519
but it was very windy,

345
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,719
so I thought, "Shall we just go back?"

346
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,989
"But since we decided to do it, let's reach it and go back."

347
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:01,689
(The buoy they're aiming for)

348
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,830
(Laughing)

349
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:08,330
(After looking back, he goes into the water too.)

350
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:23,179
(He turns the board toward Cho A's direction.)

351
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,119
- Can you go? - Yes. Again.

352
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,189
- Shall we go back? - What?

353
00:17:27,949 --> 00:17:30,290
- Do you think you can go there? - Have you gone there?

354
00:17:30,389 --> 00:17:32,559
I was almost there, but I came back when I saw you fall.

355
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,589
Really?

356
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:35,129
(Flashing)

357
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,429
- There was lightning. - Was there lightning?

358
00:17:37,699 --> 00:17:38,858
Yes, there was lightning.

359
00:17:38,859 --> 00:17:40,969
There was thunder and lightning.

360
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:43,438
At that moment, only Yong Woo and I...

361
00:17:43,439 --> 00:17:45,569
were on the water.

362
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:48,969
It felt like we were sailing together.

363
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:51,608
He felt very reliable.

364
00:17:51,609 --> 00:17:53,209
There was thunder and lightning,

365
00:17:53,379 --> 00:17:55,878
but I wasn't scared.

366
00:17:55,879 --> 00:17:58,520
I think it was because Yong Woo was by my side.

367
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,019
(It's a pity, but they decide to go back...)

368
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,419
(due to the worsening weather.)

369
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,520
(On the way back, she tries to paddle while standing.)

370
00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:07,090
- Gosh. - Nice.

371
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,439
I never fell.

372
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,040
Me too.

373
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:19,970
- Really? - Yes, I never fell.

374
00:18:20,369 --> 00:18:21,470
No, please.

375
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,109
Something splashed.

376
00:18:23,609 --> 00:18:25,340
I think someone just said that they never fell.

377
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,810
(Glancing)

378
00:18:28,109 --> 00:18:31,550
(He waits until Cho A stands back up.)

379
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,119
(Surprised)

380
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:41,358
My foot stung a little.

381
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:43,899
(He cut his foot when he fell into the water near the buoy.)

382
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:52,000
(Cho A still wants to have fun.)

383
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,310
(He thinks about how he should break it to her.)

384
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,879
I cut my foot.

385
00:19:04,349 --> 00:19:06,188
- What? - I cut my foot.

386
00:19:06,189 --> 00:19:07,449
- You cut your foot? - Yes.

387
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,119
Paddle standing up on my behalf.

388
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:14,629
Let me see. When did you get hurt?

389
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:17,760
It's cut too deeply.

390
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:20,470
- Can you go sitting down? - I can easily go sitting down.

391
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:22,699
Where did you get hurt?

392
00:19:23,139 --> 00:19:25,199
There was something down there...

393
00:19:25,399 --> 00:19:27,770
on the way there. So...

394
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,408
He said we should go back halfway,

395
00:19:31,409 --> 00:19:36,118
but I suggested to reach the buoy and come back.

396
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:38,678
We were going there once more, and he got hurt.

397
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:40,989
So I felt really sorry.

398
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:42,619
"Should I not have suggested going there?"

399
00:19:42,859 --> 00:19:45,020
I didn't know what to do.

400
00:19:45,189 --> 00:19:48,188
Internally, I hated myself for getting hurt.

401
00:19:48,189 --> 00:19:49,359
"I shouldn't have gotten hurt."

402
00:19:49,629 --> 00:19:51,529
I took Cho A's time away by getting hurt.

403
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:54,269
We could've refreshed the relationship in another way,

404
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:57,539
but it didn't work out.

405
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,909
I felt bad.

406
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,208
When you get hurt, you feel rather sorry.

407
00:20:03,209 --> 00:20:05,309
- That's right. - People try to take care of you...

408
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:07,079
- That's right. - and ask if you're okay.

409
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,479
If you're very close...

410
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,749
or already dating, it doesn't matter.

411
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,079
- But you feel that way... - That's right.

412
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,419
when you're in that stage of a relationship.

413
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,949
They're too careful with each other.

414
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,059
Hello.

415
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,128
(After a simple treatment, they go to a hospital.)

416
00:20:20,129 --> 00:20:21,859
I'm okay.

417
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,069
I'm really okay.

418
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,799
I feel sorry. You should've spent more time there.

419
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,740
I'm just grateful that you didn't get hurt worse.

420
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:33,108
I shouldn't have suggested...

421
00:20:33,109 --> 00:20:34,810
- to go to the buoy. - Going around that...

422
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:37,240
(They arrive at the hospital.)

423
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:43,449
- Sit down. - It's okay.

424
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,050
Please sit.

425
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,320
- It's okay. - Please sit down.

426
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:50,790
I think my foot will heal faster if you sit down.

427
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:53,929
I'll stay by your side.

428
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,259
I knew it,

429
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:01,128
but it reminds me again that Yong Woo is a mature person...

430
00:21:01,129 --> 00:21:03,638
even when he gets hurt,

431
00:21:03,639 --> 00:21:06,938
and that he tries not to show that he's in pain...

432
00:21:06,939 --> 00:21:08,439
or is in a tough situation.

433
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:10,638
That made me feel bad.

434
00:21:10,639 --> 00:21:14,980
I wanted to take care of him even more.

435
00:21:15,449 --> 00:21:17,948
Cho A was by my side...

436
00:21:17,949 --> 00:21:20,148
helping me,

437
00:21:20,149 --> 00:21:23,490
and it made me feel like my head was about to explode.

438
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:27,388
That was why I hated myself even more.

439
00:21:27,389 --> 00:21:30,759
She's trying to help me so much...

440
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,299
and even said that she shouldn't have suggested...

441
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:36,239
going there and felt sorry about it. She's that kind of person.

442
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,209
I hated her worrying and suffering about that.

443
00:21:40,439 --> 00:21:43,079
"I hope this moment of treatment and so on..."

444
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,280
"will be over soon."

445
00:21:44,639 --> 00:21:46,109
Sit down over there.

446
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,679
Okay.

447
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,888
I'm seated but you keep standing.

448
00:21:52,889 --> 00:21:54,249
It makes me feel like a bad person.

449
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,290
- Then can you scoot over? - Yes, so...

450
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,829
- That's why. - I'll make you a good person.

451
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:00,889
Okay.

452
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:06,230
More than feeling uncomfortable, feeling sorry is the worst.

453
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:08,868
But I got hurt. I couldn't help but feel sorry.

454
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:11,269
Almost half of her precious day...

455
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:13,169
was wasted at the hospital because of me.

456
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,310
So I think that made things worse for me.

457
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:17,980
It was really tough.

458
00:22:17,981 --> 00:22:19,679
I don't think I can ever forget how difficult it was that day.

459
00:22:20,379 --> 00:22:24,949
(Her considerate behaviour and sense of guilt made him uncomfortable.)

460
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:29,020
He's going to do something for me. He'll dress the wound.

461
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:32,320
He did something to my foot, so the wound wouldn't open up.

462
00:22:33,459 --> 00:22:35,260
- He said I would be fine. - What a relief.

463
00:22:35,629 --> 00:22:37,628
Having something on my foot gives me a great sense of reassurance.

464
00:22:37,629 --> 00:22:39,299
- Right? - The wound will stop...

465
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,398
from opening up.

466
00:22:40,399 --> 00:22:41,399
Right.

467
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,040
(Ji Won and Jae Hyung arrive at the next spot.)

468
00:22:47,209 --> 00:22:53,250
(Ji Won and Jae Hyung, chocolate factory)

469
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:01,250
These are all the tools for your painting.

470
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,790
I should awaken my senses.

471
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:05,320
How about we paint the sea?

472
00:23:05,659 --> 00:23:07,189
The sea? Nice.

473
00:23:07,389 --> 00:23:09,330
You said you wanted to go to the sea.

474
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:11,000
How about the sea at the sunset?

475
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:13,669
- Nice. We can paint the sky too. - Yes.

476
00:23:13,929 --> 00:23:15,970
Pink? How about the pink sky which you like?

477
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,009
- It's harder than I thought. - We'll need...

478
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:23,540
We'll need a lot more paint than I thought.

479
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:26,178
- Should I paint the red sky? - I see.

480
00:23:26,179 --> 00:23:27,510
- Then I'll paint the sea. - Okay.

481
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:30,220
- It's not what I expected. - It's bigger than I thought.

482
00:23:31,349 --> 00:23:33,820
- It requires artistic skills. - Right.

483
00:23:34,389 --> 00:23:35,590
We won't be able to eat this.

484
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:40,560
I think it's...

485
00:23:40,959 --> 00:23:42,389
- already doomed. - No.

486
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:45,129
Jae Hyung. The colour...

487
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:47,069
(Looking odd)

488
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:48,770
The colour doesn't look that good.

489
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:53,570
That's a weird colour.

490
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:56,039
I don't want to eat any food in that colour.

491
00:23:56,040 --> 00:24:00,179
When I was in school, I hated art classes.

492
00:24:00,709 --> 00:24:01,709
I mean...

493
00:24:02,449 --> 00:24:03,480
I'm sorry, but...

494
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:06,490
But I don't think I can eat this.

495
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:13,530
- Come on. Why are you saying that? - Gosh. No. You're right.

496
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,030
It looks beautiful.

497
00:24:15,031 --> 00:24:16,730
- But... - Wait. It looks weird.

498
00:24:17,929 --> 00:24:19,629
Can you cut this part if we're going to eat this?

499
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:24,369
I'm sorry. But I don't think...

500
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:26,770
I can eat that part.

501
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:29,069
There's something I want to do now.

502
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:30,079
What is it?

503
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,980
- Should I ask you first? - What is it?

504
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,310
A wild goose.

505
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,878
What do I do? Oh, no.

506
00:24:37,879 --> 00:24:39,720
Rub it now.

507
00:24:41,889 --> 00:24:44,490
You suddenly turned this into a scary painting.

508
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:47,359
This is scary.

509
00:24:48,689 --> 00:24:50,458
This is scary. Let's get rid of it.

510
00:24:50,459 --> 00:24:51,800
It looks like I caught a mosquito.

511
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:55,030
Did someone kill a mosquito here?

512
00:24:57,399 --> 00:24:58,970
Gosh. What's gotten into Jae Hyung?

513
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:00,510
- What's gotten into him? - Seriously?

514
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:03,179
He burst into laughter.

515
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,878
That's crazy.

516
00:25:04,879 --> 00:25:06,109
He's blinded by love now, isn't he?

517
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:07,409
This is fascinating.

518
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:10,179
This is crazy. Seriously.

519
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,919
- Gosh. - Gosh.

520
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,220
- Is it that funny? - What's so funny?

521
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,550
I don't know.

522
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,260
This...

523
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:20,489
What is this?

524
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:21,490
(He almost passes out at the doomed painting.)

525
00:25:21,491 --> 00:25:23,129
(Struggling alone to fix it)

526
00:25:23,429 --> 00:25:26,599
Go ahead. Keep painting for now. I'll paint after you.

527
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:28,199
Gosh, my stomach hurts from laughing.

528
00:25:29,369 --> 00:25:31,070
I ended up tearing up from laughing so hard.

529
00:25:31,369 --> 00:25:33,069
- Do you not like the decoration? - I love it.

530
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,470
It looks like a piece of bacon.

531
00:25:34,869 --> 00:25:36,209
- A piece of bacon and an egg? - A fried egg.

532
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,679
- Actually, the title is "Brunch." - This one...

533
00:25:40,709 --> 00:25:42,010
- Ta-da. - Ta-da.

534
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:47,290
That's the sun. I see.

535
00:25:48,649 --> 00:25:49,719
- Gosh. - What?

536
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,119
- That? - Goodness, Jae Hyung...

537
00:25:51,619 --> 00:25:52,789
- Seriously. - What's so funny?

538
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:54,659
Everyone started to question Jae Hyung's behaviour now.

539
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:57,458
- Everyone... - What is that?

540
00:25:57,459 --> 00:25:59,559
I didn't know someone could get so happy in a day.

541
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,129
- I know. Right? - I think love can be...

542
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:04,198
a scary thing.

543
00:26:04,199 --> 00:26:05,369
- It is. - Seriously.

544
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,309
Who knew he could be a completely different person?

545
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:09,270
- I guess his brain gets paralysed. - Right.

546
00:26:09,709 --> 00:26:11,679
What's happening? They only have four days left.

547
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:12,909
Do you want to take it home?

548
00:26:13,379 --> 00:26:14,379
- No. - No?

549
00:26:15,409 --> 00:26:16,949
It's for you guys to take home.

550
00:26:19,649 --> 00:26:21,189
One, two, three.

551
00:26:24,859 --> 00:26:26,789
- Gosh, it was so fun. - Yes. It was fun.

552
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:29,459
I burst into laughter pretty hard. It's not often...

553
00:26:30,099 --> 00:26:31,300
that we get to do that.

554
00:26:31,659 --> 00:26:33,429
This was the most fun I had since we started filming.

555
00:26:34,429 --> 00:26:36,499
Jae Hyung is very innocent.

556
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:40,070
He loved this activity like a little kid.

557
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:45,179
When you talk about one-dimensional bodily functions to kids,

558
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,708
they giggle and laugh.

559
00:26:46,709 --> 00:26:49,510
I saw her giggle and laugh just like a kid. So that was unexpected.

560
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:51,449
I thought she would be super calm.

561
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,220
I saw her innocent smile for the first time today.

562
00:26:54,689 --> 00:26:56,348
I felt like we had gotten...

563
00:26:56,349 --> 00:26:59,459
so close so quickly while painting with the chocolate.

564
00:27:00,429 --> 00:27:02,289
The image she had of me must have changed a lot.

565
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:04,359
The image I had of her also changed a lot.

566
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:08,730
I used to date a lot of men with a similar personality as him.

567
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:12,399
His personality is the polar opposite from mine.

568
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,010
It's fun to spend time together.

569
00:27:15,409 --> 00:27:20,080
And he helps me escape reality for a little while.

570
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:22,849
He has that kind of power over me.

571
00:27:28,149 --> 00:27:29,449
How do you feel? Are you hungry?

572
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:32,260
- Let's go and have a tasty meal. - Where are we going next?

573
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:38,629
(Yun Ha and Yun Jae, National Gallery Singapore)

574
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:40,629
She's playing the violin.

575
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:43,070
(Amazed)

576
00:27:43,199 --> 00:27:45,599
It's like the first painting was chosen for me.

577
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,509
It's interesting how they could add the contrast like this.

578
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:49,510
Right.

579
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,139
Shall we?

580
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:52,879
Be careful.

581
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,830
This is so nice.

582
00:28:18,669 --> 00:28:19,839
This place is stunning.

583
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,510
It's stunning. What in the world?

584
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,810
This place is amazing.

585
00:28:25,409 --> 00:28:27,550
- This is a beautiful place. - Right.

586
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:31,050
(The night view unfolds at the rooftop bar.)

587
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:38,519
There's a bar like that?

588
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,859
- The view is amazing. - Seriously.

589
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:41,989
It must feel like they rented out the bar.

590
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:43,129
- Right. - Yes.

591
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:44,530
That's a beautiful place.

592
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,599
It's like it's Photoshopped.

593
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,169
- We had so many fun things today. - It was so funny.

594
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:59,179
You ran away really fast.

595
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,049
(She remembers how he was attacked by the parrot.)

596
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:03,149
Were you annoyed that I left you behind earlier?

597
00:29:03,649 --> 00:29:04,779
I wasn't annoyed.

598
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:06,689
Who knew that the bird stood on your back?

599
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:08,990
This place is nice.

600
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:10,689
It's amazing. Seriously.

601
00:29:23,169 --> 00:29:25,839
You said you were jealous because of Jung Sub earlier.

602
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,639
- Yes. - What kind of feeling is that?

603
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:29,269
How should I explain it?

604
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:30,939
It's such a subtle feeling.

605
00:29:31,139 --> 00:29:33,848
It's not typical jealousy people think of.

606
00:29:33,849 --> 00:29:34,849
But...

607
00:29:35,949 --> 00:29:37,079
Does it feel like...

608
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,220
- she stole something of yours? - Yes.

609
00:29:40,189 --> 00:29:42,020
It's like, "He's mine." You know?

610
00:29:42,349 --> 00:29:43,990
To be honest, I don't care what she does.

611
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,330
But you must have some idea about the kind of guy Ji Won likes.

612
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:52,699
I don't think she likes someone she can rely on...

613
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:56,070
because she has a strong sense of who she is.

614
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:59,198
I think today's date will be the date...

615
00:29:59,199 --> 00:30:00,310
she likes the most.

616
00:30:00,409 --> 00:30:02,970
She did say that she wanted to go on a date with Jae Hyung.

617
00:30:03,409 --> 00:30:05,639
Going on a date with everyone isn't so bad. I told her that.

618
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:09,609
You were the only one who went on a date with only one person.

619
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,980
But it was my decision.

620
00:30:13,349 --> 00:30:16,449
But don't you want to go on a date with someone else?

621
00:30:16,959 --> 00:30:18,189
Not really.

622
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,790
- Really? - Yes.

623
00:30:20,459 --> 00:30:23,599
He's very direct.

624
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:28,830
So it was really nice that I could hear his honest thoughts.

625
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:31,199
That totally made my heart flutter.

626
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:34,340
What about me? What am I like?

627
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,240
You're so cheerful.

628
00:30:38,639 --> 00:30:39,780
The most cheerful person?

629
00:30:40,709 --> 00:30:43,209
Yes. I think that's why I chose you at first.

630
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:47,119
I don't tend to filter my thoughts before speaking.

631
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:51,220
That's why I like your honesty.

632
00:30:51,659 --> 00:30:53,020
Yes. I hate complicated things.

633
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:56,260
People have to spell it out for me.

634
00:30:56,629 --> 00:30:58,359
- That's more comfortable for me. - I see.

635
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:00,898
So if you were to tell me, "Don't see your female friend."

636
00:31:00,899 --> 00:31:01,929
I'd say, "Okay."

637
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,399
That's it.

638
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,539
If you tell me not to do something, I'd say, "Okay."

639
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:07,608
- Okay. - Yes.

640
00:31:07,609 --> 00:31:10,439
If it's something I can't give up, I would try to negotiate.

641
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:12,779
People say men have to know what women want...

642
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:14,550
even when they don't say a thing. That doesn't suit me.

643
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:17,550
- You like honest people. - Yes.

644
00:31:18,349 --> 00:31:19,520
I don't want to be frustrated.

645
00:31:20,389 --> 00:31:21,389
Same here.

646
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,919
When I walk, he always walks slowly at my pace...

647
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:26,359
in case my feet hurt. He always looks out for me.

648
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,129
Let's walk slowly. Your feet must hurt.

649
00:31:28,689 --> 00:31:29,790
Let's go slowly.

650
00:31:29,889 --> 00:31:33,159
He asked me if I was hot. He would fan me too.

651
00:31:34,199 --> 00:31:35,629
It's okay. I'm good now.

652
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,368
He was so considerate about many things...

653
00:31:38,369 --> 00:31:40,309
in case I was uncomfortable.

654
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:42,709
He's so sweet.

655
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:45,740
I liked him more after the date.

656
00:31:46,879 --> 00:31:49,010
- Today is such a good day. - Yes.

657
00:31:50,149 --> 00:31:51,220
I love it.

658
00:31:57,159 --> 00:31:58,159
- What? - What?

659
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:00,560
- What? - What do you mean?

660
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:02,629
So cute.

661
00:32:04,459 --> 00:32:05,760
You look cute when you smile.

662
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,500
It's already 9pm.

663
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,439
Right. Why does the time fly?

664
00:32:13,709 --> 00:32:15,070
Time really flew by.

665
00:32:15,639 --> 00:32:16,810
We have to spend it wisely.

666
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:19,679
- Every day here is so precious. - Yes.

667
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:23,179
I think we'll be able to get that in the picture at this angle.

668
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,619
I can get closer.

669
00:32:25,149 --> 00:32:26,419
Get closer then.

670
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,359
Like this?

671
00:32:31,619 --> 00:32:32,790
How do I do this?

672
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:34,689
I think I'm doomed.

673
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:36,389
Until you learn how to take a selfie.

674
00:32:36,629 --> 00:32:37,730
I think I got it.

675
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,729
Just like that. Yes.

676
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:41,270
(Frozen)

677
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,938
Hold it like this.

678
00:32:46,939 --> 00:32:48,239
- Like this. - Yes. Like this.

679
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,579
This is good. Hey, it looks nice.

680
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:51,679
Look. Like this.

681
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:55,848
That's good.

682
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:57,050
- That was a huge improvement. - Yes.

683
00:32:57,919 --> 00:32:59,649
- You improved a lot. - Yes, I improved a lot.

684
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:02,490
I'll practice taking selfies.

685
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,859
Shall we get going?

686
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:06,220
Shall we?

687
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,159
Let's go home.

688
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:12,260
(Glancing)

689
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:13,970
(Clapping)

690
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:16,730
(Clapping)

691
00:33:16,731 --> 00:33:17,770
What are you doing?

692
00:33:18,139 --> 00:33:19,199
- This? - Yes.

693
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:21,240
- Go ahead. - I haven't played this for ages.

694
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:22,540
Rice and Barley Rice?

695
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:25,539
- Come on. This is... - That's such an old move.

696
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:26,779
Isn't he trying to hold her hand...

697
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:27,948
- smoothly? - How dare he pull a dirty trick...

698
00:33:27,949 --> 00:33:28,980
I'm sorry.

699
00:33:29,709 --> 00:33:31,418
- Just do it. - But that game...

700
00:33:31,419 --> 00:33:33,720
Even my parents played this game in their generation.

701
00:33:33,889 --> 00:33:35,489
That game, Rice and Barley Rice,

702
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:37,559
and reading the palm are the oldest moves from men.

703
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,858
- The game and the reading palm. - No. There's one more.

704
00:33:38,859 --> 00:33:39,859
"Hey."

705
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,830
"You have such a big hand." Then you'd measure his palm.

706
00:33:44,929 --> 00:33:47,628
These three moves are such cliches on dates.

707
00:33:47,629 --> 00:33:48,629
Barley rice.

708
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:51,069
Seriously. It's been so long since I played this game.

709
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:53,270
What? Seriously? You don't remember this game?

710
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:54,669
Let's try again.

711
00:33:55,609 --> 00:33:56,910
Isn't this an old game?

712
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:58,809
Barley rice.

713
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:00,410
Barley rice.

714
00:34:01,709 --> 00:34:03,078
- Let's try again. - Get some sleep.

715
00:34:03,079 --> 00:34:04,680
- Let's try it again. - No.

716
00:34:04,879 --> 00:34:06,179
I think you're still drunk.

717
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,549
- Let's try it again. - Get some sleep.

718
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:08,589
- No. - Let's try it again.

719
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:09,890
Barley rice.

720
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,359
Barley rice.

721
00:34:13,859 --> 00:34:14,859
Barley rice.

722
00:34:15,129 --> 00:34:17,899
(The cycle of Barley rice is endless.)

723
00:34:20,329 --> 00:34:21,370
Barley rice.

724
00:34:21,769 --> 00:34:23,470
- I'm doing a good job. - You keep giving me barley rice.

725
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:24,640
What? Rice!

726
00:34:28,439 --> 00:34:29,740
I'll start with the parrot. Bring the parrot.

727
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:33,109
It will be so funny if Ji Won wants dating advice from me.

728
00:34:33,609 --> 00:34:35,109
Does Jung Sub ask for your advice?

729
00:34:35,249 --> 00:34:36,850
No. I ask him for advice.

730
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:39,320
You do?

731
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:42,450
There are situations where I have to read men.

732
00:34:42,919 --> 00:34:45,119
Men are either too slow to pick up on things...

733
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,689
or have no interest. It's 1 of these 2 cases.

734
00:34:47,059 --> 00:34:48,430
I'm slow too.

735
00:34:48,930 --> 00:34:49,959
I bet.

736
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,829
I would never know if they don't spell it out for me.

737
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:55,628
Then women will be so disappointed.

738
00:34:55,629 --> 00:34:56,629
Right.

739
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:58,669
But women have to tell men about that.

740
00:34:58,769 --> 00:35:00,539
For example, they can say, "Why did you do that?"

741
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,709
- I can learn once I'm told that. - Right.

742
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:04,478
But with my recent relationship,

743
00:35:04,479 --> 00:35:07,180
I didn't ask things like "Why did you do that?"

744
00:35:07,609 --> 00:35:09,510
We mostly had disagreements...

745
00:35:09,809 --> 00:35:12,119
because we had different opinions on things.

746
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,479
I think we had more disagreements of that nature.

747
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:16,289
I'll apologize quickly. I'll do that.

748
00:35:17,689 --> 00:35:18,760
Right away.

749
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:21,828
It's important to learn about...

750
00:35:21,829 --> 00:35:23,858
each other's mindset when it comes to dating.

751
00:35:23,859 --> 00:35:25,228
So I tried to make a good impression on her about that.

752
00:35:25,229 --> 00:35:28,429
We saw eye to eye during our discussion about that.

753
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:29,470
So that was really nice.

754
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:32,200
Yun Jae is ready to start a relationship with her.

755
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:36,569
Don't you think he's the only one who's completely immersed in this?

756
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:38,409
- Right. - He doesn't give excuses...

757
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:39,708
- or whatnot. - Right.

758
00:35:39,709 --> 00:35:42,050
He doesn't even do this. "Were you like this in the past?"

759
00:35:42,209 --> 00:35:43,918
- "Are you like this?" - That's why I like him.

760
00:35:43,919 --> 00:35:44,978
He doesn't even ask such questions.

761
00:35:44,979 --> 00:35:46,349
- Right. - He's all about the present.

762
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:47,489
- Him and her in the present. - The present moment.

763
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:48,518
- He focuses on the present. - "You and me."

764
00:35:48,519 --> 00:35:49,648
- Yes. You're right. - Right.

765
00:35:49,649 --> 00:35:51,518
(Se Seung and Jung Sub, izakaya)

766
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:52,590
This is beautiful.

767
00:35:53,289 --> 00:35:54,329
Cheers.

768
00:35:56,459 --> 00:35:58,530
They like history.

769
00:35:58,859 --> 00:36:00,699
- History? - They like history.

770
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,069
- Right. They like history. - They love it.

771
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:03,938
But it's okay as long as both of them like it.

772
00:36:03,939 --> 00:36:05,168
- Of course. - Like archaeologists.

773
00:36:05,169 --> 00:36:06,398
- They're archaeologists. - Yes.

774
00:36:06,399 --> 00:36:08,438
They like to leave their footprints.

775
00:36:08,439 --> 00:36:10,640
They like to dig that up and research about it.

776
00:36:14,149 --> 00:36:15,479
- This is so nice. - I love it.

777
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,689
Five seconds.

778
00:36:21,189 --> 00:36:22,189
(Extending)

779
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:26,058
What is this? Is this the moon?

780
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:28,729
No. I wanted to hold the Marina Bay Sands.

781
00:36:29,959 --> 00:36:31,458
I thought you wanted to make a heart.

782
00:36:31,459 --> 00:36:33,870
(A cute misunderstanding by Se Seung)

783
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:38,470
But...

784
00:36:38,939 --> 00:36:40,510
the heart...

785
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,979
Hey, why did you mislead me?

786
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,640
(Embarrassed)

787
00:36:47,249 --> 00:36:49,249
- I won't do it. - I'm sorry.

788
00:36:50,309 --> 00:36:51,320
I'm sorry.

789
00:36:51,919 --> 00:36:53,820
No. The Marina Bay Sands...

790
00:36:54,689 --> 00:36:56,550
is right in the middle.

791
00:36:57,459 --> 00:36:58,659
I'm a bit embarrassed.

792
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:00,160
- Can you make a heart with me? - Let's do it.

793
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,328
(It ends with a heart.)

794
00:37:05,329 --> 00:37:06,700
This is fun.

795
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:14,739
- Se Seung. Try that. - Yes?

796
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:15,769
Should I try it?

797
00:37:21,749 --> 00:37:22,809
- It's tasty. - Right.

798
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:25,680
- Gosh. - I'm so happy.

799
00:37:25,681 --> 00:37:27,890
This is the best piece of meat I ever had in my life.

800
00:37:28,789 --> 00:37:29,820
This is fun.

801
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:33,359
It was a hot day. Thank you for hanging in there.

802
00:37:33,729 --> 00:37:35,489
- No. It wasn't that hard. - I didn't know it'd be this humid.

803
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:36,558
I had so much fun.

804
00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:37,660
- Really? - Yes.

805
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:42,870
I think today's date was better than our second date.

806
00:37:43,229 --> 00:37:44,340
The Ring-ring Date.

807
00:37:44,669 --> 00:37:46,240
I see. Our second date?

808
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:50,239
Have you mostly dated calm people?

809
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,140
Or bubbly people?

810
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,608
- They're talking about history. - See? They started.

811
00:37:53,609 --> 00:37:55,050
- Hold on. - What?

812
00:37:55,479 --> 00:37:57,549
- They became archaeologists again. - Right. Back to history.

813
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:58,879
- They'll be okay. - Those two...

814
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:01,349
But doesn't it mean they have similar personalities?

815
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:03,049
- They like talking about the past. - Right.

816
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:04,620
- They decided to bring it up. - Right.

817
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:08,429
Have you mostly dated calm people?

818
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:10,399
Or bubbly people?

819
00:38:10,499 --> 00:38:12,999
I think I dated more calm people than bubbly people.

820
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:17,399
You sort of have a bubbly side.

821
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,599
You sometimes like to act cute. Right?

822
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,768
How did you know?

823
00:38:20,769 --> 00:38:22,209
I know you.

824
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,410
You definitely like to act cute.

825
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,709
You do too.

826
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,450
"My sister is the prettiest."

827
00:38:32,019 --> 00:38:33,890
Did you say you mostly dated older men?

828
00:38:34,189 --> 00:38:35,919
I've dated older men and men who were the same age as me.

829
00:38:39,459 --> 00:38:40,760
But you dated older men more, right?

830
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:42,529
One older guy, one younger guy,

831
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:43,530
and the rest were the same age as me.

832
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,228
- That's not easy. - Don't number them like that.

833
00:38:46,229 --> 00:38:48,070
- Don't do that. Just eat the meat. - How many men did she date?

834
00:38:48,499 --> 00:38:49,829
She'll give him that much information?

835
00:38:50,129 --> 00:38:52,139
- Don't go over them individually. - It started.

836
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,768
They should grill more meat.

837
00:38:53,769 --> 00:38:55,510
- She'll be this detailed? - Fill their mouths with meat.

838
00:38:56,939 --> 00:38:58,280
But you dated older men more, right?

839
00:38:58,439 --> 00:39:00,078
One older guy, one younger guy,

840
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:01,079
and the rest were the same age as me.

841
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:03,180
- Is that so? - Yes.

842
00:39:03,709 --> 00:39:05,579
But you mostly dated older women.

843
00:39:05,749 --> 00:39:08,390
Right. I can't stop asking you these questions.

844
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:10,620
Ask me away.

845
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,390
I mean,

846
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:18,159
I want to focus only on the present.

847
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,870
But it's interesting how I'm thinking about your past.

848
00:39:21,999 --> 00:39:24,200
That's what I sensed recently.

849
00:39:25,439 --> 00:39:30,039
Your past decisions shaped the present you.

850
00:39:30,169 --> 00:39:33,579
The fact that I was thinking about your past...

851
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:36,149
made me wonder if I valued the past.

852
00:39:36,649 --> 00:39:38,019
That crossed my mind.

853
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:44,019
- Are you bothered by the past? - You know?

854
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,418
It was fascinating.

855
00:39:46,419 --> 00:39:49,829
I thought I would be happy with sharing the present moment.

856
00:39:50,059 --> 00:39:53,659
But I found myself asking you "How was this? What was this like?"

857
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:56,370
The fact that I'm asking you about your past was unexpected.

858
00:39:57,269 --> 00:40:00,140
I can just accept the present moment I'm sharing with someone...

859
00:40:00,669 --> 00:40:04,879
and love the present moment. It's like loving that brief moment.

860
00:40:07,979 --> 00:40:09,349
Jung Sub told me...

861
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:12,479
that he had always valued the present.

862
00:40:12,649 --> 00:40:14,620
But he said he was curious about my past.

863
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:17,519
He asked me about my past relationships.

864
00:40:17,789 --> 00:40:19,688
From what I felt from his facial expression,

865
00:40:19,689 --> 00:40:21,590
he didn't seem happy.

866
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:24,459
Did it mean he felt insecure?

867
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:31,870
There you go again.

868
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:34,639
- She started that again. - She shouldn't do that, though.

869
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,280
Why not? He's handsome. That's why she's staring.

870
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:40,509
Jung Sub must feel that she's expressing her interest.

871
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:42,309
Yes. She started that again.

872
00:40:42,579 --> 00:40:43,918
You're right. She started that again.

873
00:40:43,919 --> 00:40:45,620
- Right? I told you. - Right.

874
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,450
There you go again.

875
00:40:49,649 --> 00:40:51,120
The staring skill.

876
00:40:53,189 --> 00:40:55,660
It feels like you're reading me like an open book.

877
00:40:58,329 --> 00:41:03,070
I told you that I was sweet to everyone.

878
00:41:03,229 --> 00:41:04,269
Yes.

879
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:06,070
You're sweet.

880
00:41:06,169 --> 00:41:07,169
But...

881
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:11,780
when I go on dates with other people, I don't do this.

882
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:18,120
What do you mean by that?

883
00:41:19,019 --> 00:41:20,820
And how could I know that?

884
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:23,620
Here's what my brother said.

885
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:26,990
Because I'm only interested in you,

886
00:41:27,789 --> 00:41:30,030
he told me that I should be cautious.

887
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,299
I thought I had expressed myself enough to the point...

888
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,800
that even my brother could see it.

889
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:36,129
- Right. - Yes.

890
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:39,140
You're right. I agree.

891
00:41:39,999 --> 00:41:43,409
Jae Hyung told her to be cautious.

892
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:46,709
In my opinion, he had a point.

893
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:49,050
His advice was sound.

894
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,320
I wondered if I had taken...

895
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:56,189
your chances. Or if that happened organically.

896
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:01,429
I'm not sure. Well, my chances...

897
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:02,759
Well, it's up to you to make the most of them.

898
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,859
- Right. - Yes.

899
00:42:04,399 --> 00:42:05,399
You're right.

900
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:09,070
Anyway, I'm very happy and having fun right now.

901
00:42:10,269 --> 00:42:11,269
That's all.

902
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,970
- You don't seem like it. - This is...

903
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:28,419
This feels like a fling.

904
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:31,320
- Between you and me? - Yes, it feels like a fling.

905
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,789
In situations like this,

906
00:42:36,229 --> 00:42:38,800
people tend to be apart and all. That's usually the case.

907
00:42:39,229 --> 00:42:41,300
But you and I are together all the time.

908
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:44,700
So it feels kind of weird.

909
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:46,769
(Thinking)

910
00:42:48,039 --> 00:42:49,510
What he said...

911
00:42:50,269 --> 00:42:52,180
didn't sound so positive.

912
00:42:52,309 --> 00:42:54,349
When someone says it's a fling,

913
00:42:54,350 --> 00:42:55,979
it feels quite casual.

914
00:42:56,109 --> 00:42:58,979
I told her it felt like we were having a fling.

915
00:42:59,149 --> 00:43:02,450
But that is true.

916
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:08,090
- What? - What?

917
00:43:08,289 --> 00:43:10,629
- What is it? - I'm just taking in what you said.

918
00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:12,059
What about you?

919
00:43:12,359 --> 00:43:14,269
Well, that's true.

920
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:16,300
You're right.

921
00:43:16,301 --> 00:43:20,640
If I were to express aggressively...

922
00:43:22,539 --> 00:43:24,378
From Se Seung's reaction,

923
00:43:24,379 --> 00:43:26,208
it didn't look like it was an answer she wanted.

924
00:43:26,209 --> 00:43:27,709
That's what I felt.

925
00:43:28,149 --> 00:43:31,519
But I still want to be careful.

926
00:43:36,749 --> 00:43:37,788
- Okay. - Can we?

927
00:43:37,789 --> 00:43:39,959
Let's not make any more misunderstanding.

928
00:43:40,189 --> 00:43:43,328
When you just told me that we were having a fling,

929
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:45,499
it didn't sound so positive.

930
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:47,869
- It's a positive expression. - Is that so?

931
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:50,269
Okay. See? Let's not make any misunderstandings.

932
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:54,339
"I think this is just a fling. That's it."

933
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,038
That's how I took it.

934
00:43:56,039 --> 00:43:57,069
No.

935
00:43:57,070 --> 00:44:00,240
I didn't define this as a fling or anything like that.

936
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:02,878
It suddenly sounds so casual. "A fling?"

937
00:44:02,879 --> 00:44:03,879
I see.

938
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:07,890
To me, having a fling doesn't come easily.

939
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:10,959
Same here. It's the same with me, Jung Sub.

940
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:15,229
- It's the same with me. - Is that so? Okay.

941
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:20,160
I think the seriousness of our expressions was different.

942
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:23,129
I liked Cho A's aura.

943
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:25,899
So I chose her to go on a date in Gangwon Province.

944
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,840
But it never felt like I was having a fling with her.

945
00:44:30,169 --> 00:44:32,410
Jung Sub was expressing the opposite of what I felt.

946
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:34,579
So it could've been a huge misunderstanding again.

947
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,820
You're staring at every part of my face.

948
00:44:47,419 --> 00:44:48,958
Actually, Se Seung is...

949
00:44:48,959 --> 00:44:51,828
the only person I've had deep conversations with,

950
00:44:51,829 --> 00:44:55,328
and she's the one I have the most fun with while in it.

951
00:44:55,329 --> 00:44:56,600
I really loved that.

952
00:44:56,829 --> 00:44:58,869
Since I was on a date with him all day...

953
00:44:58,870 --> 00:45:00,639
while feeling secure,

954
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,839
I felt like we became a real couple.

955
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:05,609
I was so happy all day.

956
00:45:20,359 --> 00:45:21,559
Seriously, though,

957
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:26,459
why do you stare at me like that?

958
00:45:26,629 --> 00:45:28,200
I was always curious.

959
00:45:32,399 --> 00:45:33,470
Is that your strategy?

960
00:45:35,709 --> 00:45:37,578
What are you talking about?

961
00:45:37,579 --> 00:45:38,938
I'm a strategy consultant,

962
00:45:38,939 --> 00:45:40,979
but I don't strategise something like this as well.

963
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:45,019
- So it's true. - No.

964
00:45:45,850 --> 00:45:48,149
- I knew it. - You...

965
00:45:48,689 --> 00:45:49,749
You...

966
00:45:51,289 --> 00:45:53,820
I'm happy when I look at you. That's why.

967
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:00,329
(Looking away)

968
00:46:01,129 --> 00:46:02,869
That's so pretty, right?

969
00:46:02,870 --> 00:46:03,870
Yes.

970
00:46:06,669 --> 00:46:07,809
Why are you staring at me?

971
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:10,139
I'm giving it a try...

972
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:11,340
to see what it's like.

973
00:46:18,519 --> 00:46:19,519
Goodness.

974
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:22,689
I feel like I should do something for you.

975
00:46:23,050 --> 00:46:24,050
I'll stop looking at you.

976
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,160
No, then I get a little bored.

977
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:32,458
You get a little sad, Jung Sub?

978
00:46:32,459 --> 00:46:33,660
I get bored.

979
00:46:36,399 --> 00:46:41,439
(Ji Won and Jae Hyung at Senor Taco Chijmes)

980
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:52,019
It's pretty.

981
00:46:53,379 --> 00:46:55,619
It looks so cool.

982
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:56,850
It's exotic.

983
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:05,399
The fan here is...

984
00:47:06,430 --> 00:47:08,070
It's quite strong.

985
00:47:08,499 --> 00:47:09,870
- Do you want to sit here, then? - Yes.

986
00:47:15,209 --> 00:47:17,269
Are you okay with the fan, though?

987
00:47:18,979 --> 00:47:20,039
Your hair.

988
00:47:20,309 --> 00:47:21,309
What do you want to drink?

989
00:47:21,310 --> 00:47:23,878
Do you want a cocktail or a beer?

990
00:47:23,879 --> 00:47:25,879
- I want a cocktail. - Shall we have a cocktail?

991
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:29,490
(While Ji Won is gone, their cocktails arrived.)

992
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:35,059
Why does mine look so intense?

993
00:47:35,689 --> 00:47:37,629
Doesn't it look too strong?

994
00:47:38,059 --> 00:47:39,659
But you can hold your liquor.

995
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:41,470
Yes, I can.

996
00:47:41,669 --> 00:47:44,030
- I think I'll lose. - I think I'll win.

997
00:47:47,039 --> 00:47:49,269
- I love losing. - Okay.

998
00:47:49,939 --> 00:47:51,309
You don't have to drink more than someone.

999
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:53,739
I meant I don't mind losing to you.

1000
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:55,450
- In everything? - Yes.

1001
00:47:56,309 --> 00:47:57,350
Cheers.

1002
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:05,459
Hold on.

1003
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:07,788
Jae Hyung can't take his eyes off.

1004
00:48:07,789 --> 00:48:10,358
He's staring at her just like Se Seung does.

1005
00:48:10,359 --> 00:48:11,359
That's true.

1006
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:13,399
They're indeed siblings.

1007
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:20,140
How is it?

1008
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:22,910
Try it. I'll try yours.

1009
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:26,340
What?

1010
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:29,649
Yours is a baby drink.

1011
00:48:34,649 --> 00:48:36,149
- Gosh. - It's their signature.

1012
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:42,160
The signature drink is good.

1013
00:48:43,189 --> 00:48:44,229
It's good.

1014
00:48:44,430 --> 00:48:45,800
It wakes me up.

1015
00:48:56,539 --> 00:48:58,680
You're good at making facial expressions too.

1016
00:49:01,950 --> 00:49:03,949
I'm quite good at that too.

1017
00:49:03,950 --> 00:49:07,450
Right. Your facial muscles are also...

1018
00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:09,519
How do I put this?

1019
00:49:10,249 --> 00:49:12,089
- They're independent? - Yes!

1020
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:13,688
How did you know? I was just going to say that.

1021
00:49:13,689 --> 00:49:17,390
You can move your facial muscles freely.

1022
00:49:19,859 --> 00:49:21,669
But the fan is a little...

1023
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:23,370
Right? It's too strong.

1024
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:25,869
- It's okay. I'll have messy hair. - Is it okay?

1025
00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:26,939
Still, you look handsome.

1026
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,038
(Feeling a little shy)

1027
00:49:30,039 --> 00:49:32,079
I think I love Singapore.

1028
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:34,749
- I love it. - Why?

1029
00:49:34,879 --> 00:49:37,280
I think it's very chill.

1030
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:41,719
Are you laughing at me?

1031
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:42,989
- Yes. - Why?

1032
00:49:42,990 --> 00:49:44,959
That sounded a little cringey.

1033
00:49:48,530 --> 00:49:49,590
Chill?

1034
00:49:55,570 --> 00:49:58,769
What do I do? I feel like I've become a fan.

1035
00:49:58,999 --> 00:50:00,169
That took some time.

1036
00:50:00,899 --> 00:50:02,409
I became his fan in Episode One.

1037
00:50:02,410 --> 00:50:03,739
- Right. - I know.

1038
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:05,340
He's so cute.

1039
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:06,878
That's why...

1040
00:50:06,879 --> 00:50:08,309
- you should get to know them. - You're right.

1041
00:50:15,019 --> 00:50:16,489
It's good.

1042
00:50:16,490 --> 00:50:18,390
Isn't that Park Hae Mi?

1043
00:50:18,459 --> 00:50:20,260
- Park Hae Mi. "Supermarket..." - "Did you go to the supermarket?"

1044
00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:22,160
"Well, Young Gi's mom..."

1045
00:50:25,729 --> 00:50:27,260
You're good at that.

1046
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:28,668
Do you enjoy cilantro?

1047
00:50:28,669 --> 00:50:29,929
Do you think I do?

1048
00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:31,100
- No. - Right.

1049
00:50:31,970 --> 00:50:35,340
I feel like you'll have ramyeon tonight again.

1050
00:50:37,709 --> 00:50:38,740
I...

1051
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,739
don't often eat ramyeon at 3 or 4am,

1052
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:42,578
but I can't help it here.

1053
00:50:42,579 --> 00:50:44,649
- Why did you do that, though? - I was sad.

1054
00:50:45,919 --> 00:50:48,648
There's a cute side of you.

1055
00:50:48,649 --> 00:50:49,649
Why?

1056
00:50:52,789 --> 00:50:53,959
Honestly, it's hard, right?

1057
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:56,059
Do you want my drink instead?

1058
00:50:56,359 --> 00:50:57,899
Should I try a mojito?

1059
00:50:58,100 --> 00:50:59,760
Can we have two mojitos?

1060
00:51:02,430 --> 00:51:04,669
- What does this taste like? - Corn.

1061
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:07,100
- Are you a thinker? - I'm 90 percent a feeler.

1062
00:51:09,470 --> 00:51:10,668
This is why I say...

1063
00:51:10,669 --> 00:51:13,079
the MBTI test is not trustworthy.

1064
00:51:13,479 --> 00:51:15,679
- What's your MBTI type again? ENFJ? - Yes.

1065
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:16,680
It's the same as Se Seung.

1066
00:51:16,809 --> 00:51:18,478
Yes. It's the same as her.

1067
00:51:18,479 --> 00:51:20,120
We have a lot in common.

1068
00:51:20,419 --> 00:51:21,748
- With Se Seung? - Yes.

1069
00:51:21,749 --> 00:51:24,288
What do you think about a girl similar to your sister?

1070
00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:25,359
I don't really like it.

1071
00:51:27,559 --> 00:51:29,329
You're similar to my brother too.

1072
00:51:29,459 --> 00:51:30,989
What do you think about that?

1073
00:51:30,990 --> 00:51:32,030
I hate it a little.

1074
00:51:32,459 --> 00:51:33,899
You're a little meaner than me.

1075
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:35,970
(He received a harsher response.)

1076
00:51:36,070 --> 00:51:37,129
I'll let you win.

1077
00:51:38,570 --> 00:51:41,168
I can't wait to go to a mojito and have the Maldives.

1078
00:51:41,169 --> 00:51:43,939
I guess they're taking long because they went to a mojito...

1079
00:51:44,609 --> 00:51:45,978
to get the Maldives.

1080
00:51:45,979 --> 00:51:47,779
No, they're making a mojito here.

1081
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:50,108
They don't make it at the Maldives.

1082
00:51:50,109 --> 00:51:52,050
(Are you a thinker?)

1083
00:51:53,419 --> 00:51:55,120
You really seem like a thinker.

1084
00:51:56,289 --> 00:51:59,159
But I said, "Oh, dear. It's so pretty."

1085
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:00,589
- "It's so nice." - When did you go like,

1086
00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:02,288
"Oh, dear. It's so pretty?"

1087
00:52:02,289 --> 00:52:04,430
"Oh, dear. It's so pretty."

1088
00:52:05,059 --> 00:52:06,199
You went like this.

1089
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:07,430
Hey! When did I say that...

1090
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:09,069
in a monotonous tone?

1091
00:52:09,070 --> 00:52:10,399
Are you dropping the honorifics now?

1092
00:52:12,039 --> 00:52:13,370
You sounded like a feeler just now.

1093
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:14,570
- Didn't you? - I was joking.

1094
00:52:14,769 --> 00:52:16,070
Is that so?

1095
00:52:18,439 --> 00:52:20,109
What do you think?

1096
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:21,680
We only have four days left now.

1097
00:52:21,950 --> 00:52:24,950
For the most part, I think it's a shame,

1098
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:26,819
but I feel a little relieved too.

1099
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:28,149
- Relieved? - Yes.

1100
00:52:28,689 --> 00:52:31,019
Where does that come from?

1101
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:33,389
Before coming to Singapore,

1102
00:52:33,390 --> 00:52:37,458
I really wanted to go out with you.

1103
00:52:37,459 --> 00:52:40,160
We ended up going out in the end.

1104
00:52:40,859 --> 00:52:43,668
In a way, it happened soon...

1105
00:52:43,669 --> 00:52:45,100
even though we don't have much time left.

1106
00:52:45,970 --> 00:52:49,740
That's why I thought I was relieved.

1107
00:52:55,079 --> 00:52:58,050
Seeing you wearing a star bracelet and cutting tomatoes like that...

1108
00:52:58,550 --> 00:52:59,619
What do you think?

1109
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:00,879
- You look cute. - Cute?

1110
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:02,590
- Shall we turn these on? - Yes.

1111
00:53:03,749 --> 00:53:06,159
I'm a dog person.

1112
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,159
I particularly love puppies...

1113
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:09,930
that tend to get lost easily at night.

1114
00:53:12,930 --> 00:53:16,499
How do you want to spend the rest of the time we have?

1115
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:18,140
I don't think...

1116
00:53:18,970 --> 00:53:21,370
I should learn more about others.

1117
00:53:21,570 --> 00:53:23,209
As I told you before,

1118
00:53:23,939 --> 00:53:26,078
when I make up my mind, I focus on it no matter what.

1119
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:27,079
I see.

1120
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:30,850
I won't spend the remaining four days confused.

1121
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:34,248
"What should I do? What do I do?"

1122
00:53:34,249 --> 00:53:38,390
I don't think I'd have these thoughts.

1123
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:41,019
As I'm saying it, I'm doing this.

1124
00:53:42,359 --> 00:53:43,490
I think so too.

1125
00:53:43,829 --> 00:53:44,898
You'd be like this?

1126
00:53:44,899 --> 00:53:46,659
- Use it like a walkie-talkie. - I wouldn't be confused either.

1127
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:47,700
I think so.

1128
00:53:48,999 --> 00:53:50,070
What?

1129
00:53:51,129 --> 00:53:52,300
I think so.

1130
00:53:53,470 --> 00:53:55,308
You couldn't hear me well?

1131
00:53:55,309 --> 00:53:56,410
You're annoying.

1132
00:54:08,050 --> 00:54:09,649
You can't gloat.

1133
00:54:11,689 --> 00:54:13,320
You're so fun.

1134
00:54:13,459 --> 00:54:15,729
- Do you like fun people? - Yes.

1135
00:54:16,459 --> 00:54:18,399
I don't like people who laugh at me.

1136
00:54:19,499 --> 00:54:20,530
Smile.

1137
00:54:21,870 --> 00:54:23,930
Your dimples are adorable.

1138
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:25,570
- Oh, my. - Goodness.

1139
00:54:25,769 --> 00:54:26,769
What are you going to do, Hye Jin?

1140
00:54:26,770 --> 00:54:29,070
- Hye Jin, calm down. - My gosh, Hye Jin.

1141
00:54:29,269 --> 00:54:31,439
You're the one who should calm down, not Patricia.

1142
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:33,709
My gosh. He's so adorable.

1143
00:54:34,510 --> 00:54:35,809
Look at his face.

1144
00:54:35,950 --> 00:54:38,219
- Look at that face now. - That face.

1145
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:39,319
Hye Jin, I was his first fan.

1146
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:40,978
I'm sorry.

1147
00:54:40,979 --> 00:54:42,789
- How dare you? - I'm sorry, sir.

1148
00:54:44,859 --> 00:54:46,159
Jae Hyung, if I hadn't become a fan at the start,

1149
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:47,419
you wouldn't have appeared as much.

1150
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:51,160
I totally agree.

1151
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:53,129
Smile.

1152
00:54:54,530 --> 00:54:56,599
Your dimples are adorable.

1153
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,740
How can they be so deep?

1154
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,268
I have dimples here too.

1155
00:55:00,269 --> 00:55:02,639
I know. You have them here too.

1156
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:05,379
The dimples on your cheek are so deep.

1157
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:08,649
Here.

1158
00:55:09,109 --> 00:55:10,878
I thought he was the type of person...

1159
00:55:10,879 --> 00:55:14,049
that I was naturally attracted to.

1160
00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:15,589
At that moment,

1161
00:55:15,590 --> 00:55:18,559
I thought, "She's the one."

1162
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:21,058
I had so much fun at that moment.

1163
00:55:21,059 --> 00:55:22,989
The atmosphere was good, and we really hit it off.

1164
00:55:22,990 --> 00:55:24,958
We got to know each other better all day,

1165
00:55:24,959 --> 00:55:27,700
so I thought, "Is she the one?"

1166
00:55:28,129 --> 00:55:31,539
Based on the way she spoke to me,

1167
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:33,569
I thought...

1168
00:55:33,570 --> 00:55:37,439
I wasn't the only one who felt that way.

1169
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:39,309
That's how I felt.

1170
00:55:39,510 --> 00:55:41,949
I thought we were into each other.

1171
00:55:41,950 --> 00:55:44,780
(We're into each other for sure.)

1172
00:55:46,019 --> 00:55:47,079
I could feel it.

1173
00:55:47,379 --> 00:55:49,590
I hinted at it so she could feel it too.

1174
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:58,499
When I was a baby, I had like 11 dimples.

1175
00:56:00,059 --> 00:56:02,269
I had big cheeks like this.

1176
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:07,070
You were so cute as a baby.

1177
00:56:07,870 --> 00:56:10,010
You seemed to have a lot of talent since you were a kid.

1178
00:56:13,209 --> 00:56:15,949
Seeing them makes me feel good.

1179
00:56:15,950 --> 00:56:18,050
It puts my mind at ease.

1180
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:19,950
It's so nice seeing them like that.

1181
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:22,850
This is insane.

1182
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:25,788
- You slept here? - Yes.

1183
00:56:25,789 --> 00:56:26,859
Weren't you cold?

1184
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:29,688
Why is this place so nice?

1185
00:56:29,689 --> 00:56:30,759
It's much colder inside.

1186
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:32,128
I brought everything from the couch.

1187
00:56:32,129 --> 00:56:33,700
It's so nice here.

1188
00:56:33,999 --> 00:56:36,229
It feels nice to listen to crickets.

1189
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:39,239
If you could go on a date with someone now,

1190
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:40,269
would you choose Ji Won, then?

1191
00:56:40,669 --> 00:56:43,669
Yes. I think so for now.

1192
00:56:44,910 --> 00:56:46,579
I'm curious about her.

1193
00:56:48,850 --> 00:56:52,050
Anyone else you want to go out with, besides Jae Hyung?

1194
00:56:54,050 --> 00:56:55,449
Not really.

1195
00:56:55,450 --> 00:56:56,490
- No? - Yes.

1196
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:59,319
I'm really struggling.

1197
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:00,359
I'm struggling too.

1198
00:57:03,059 --> 00:57:04,059
This is the hardest.

1199
00:57:05,499 --> 00:57:07,029
It would've been nice...

1200
00:57:07,030 --> 00:57:10,768
if we had more chances to go on a date back in Seoul.

1201
00:57:10,769 --> 00:57:13,768
- I believe in fate, though. - Me too.

1202
00:57:13,769 --> 00:57:15,339
- Really? - I truly believe in fate.

1203
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:17,739
I have such strong faith in destiny...

1204
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:20,009
that I tend to think, "This was meant to happen."

1205
00:57:20,010 --> 00:57:23,208
- In a way, I'm being avoidant. - Right.

1206
00:57:23,209 --> 00:57:25,949
- Yes. It's being avoidant. - Yes.

1207
00:57:25,950 --> 00:57:27,649
When you have a lot on your mind,

1208
00:57:27,950 --> 00:57:30,049
you want to believe it's fate,

1209
00:57:30,050 --> 00:57:32,458
- Right. - as a way to avoid facing it.

1210
00:57:32,459 --> 00:57:34,858
That way, you can simply go along with it...

1211
00:57:34,859 --> 00:57:36,929
- and let it go. - Right.

1212
00:57:36,930 --> 00:57:40,200
Will the next four days go smoothly?

1213
00:57:41,399 --> 00:57:44,070
I'm not sure. Maybe not.

1214
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:47,969
Some pairs are obvious.

1215
00:57:47,970 --> 00:57:49,708
Which ones are obvious to you?

1216
00:57:49,709 --> 00:57:52,208
We must share a similar opinion.

1217
00:57:52,209 --> 00:57:53,639
What? Jung Sub and Se Seung?

1218
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:55,149
Cho A and Yong Woo.

1219
00:57:56,450 --> 00:57:58,350
They're like newlyweds.

1220
00:57:58,519 --> 00:58:00,519
Are they that close?

1221
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:03,589
I didn't know they were that close.

1222
00:58:03,590 --> 00:58:04,919
Ju Yeon said...

1223
00:58:05,859 --> 00:58:07,289
Cho A is totally his type.

1224
00:58:09,329 --> 00:58:10,929
Cho A is super cute.

1225
00:58:10,930 --> 00:58:12,458
"Hello."

1226
00:58:12,459 --> 00:58:13,529
(Doing an impression of Cho A)

1227
00:58:13,530 --> 00:58:14,700
"Hello, Cho A."

1228
00:58:15,229 --> 00:58:18,029
Right. You seem to act cute around older women.

1229
00:58:18,030 --> 00:58:20,168
Me? I like acting cute.

1230
00:58:20,169 --> 00:58:21,769
Why don't you do that with me, then?

1231
00:58:22,539 --> 00:58:24,168
If I acted cute with you...

1232
00:58:24,169 --> 00:58:26,209
- Would it hurt your ego? - No.

1233
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:29,910
- I might start to do so. - Is that so?

1234
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:36,418
It must feel different...

1235
00:58:36,419 --> 00:58:38,659
when we meet again after this.

1236
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:40,019
You and me? Or...

1237
00:58:41,459 --> 00:58:42,789
How do you think it'd be?

1238
00:58:42,859 --> 00:58:44,030
It'd be more...

1239
00:58:47,059 --> 00:58:48,159
It's a secret.

1240
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:49,229
(Frowning)

1241
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:56,010
You were like Bruce Lee just now.

1242
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:57,609
What? Tell me.

1243
00:59:00,109 --> 00:59:03,748
I feel like you'd be more relaxed.

1244
00:59:03,749 --> 00:59:06,019
That's what I think.

1245
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:08,689
Now you're a little...

1246
00:59:09,350 --> 00:59:11,389
Jae Hyung is resting his chin on his hand.

1247
00:59:11,390 --> 00:59:12,889
The distance between them is different.

1248
00:59:12,890 --> 00:59:15,029
- They're super close now. - I was going to mention that.

1249
00:59:15,030 --> 00:59:17,659
- He's staying close like this. - Right.

1250
00:59:17,660 --> 00:59:19,359
And he let his guard all the way down.

1251
00:59:19,559 --> 00:59:21,399
Ji Won also seems relaxed too.

1252
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:24,628
I didn't expect him to disarm her like this.

1253
00:59:24,629 --> 00:59:25,669
I know.

1254
00:59:26,970 --> 00:59:29,608
It must feel different...

1255
00:59:29,609 --> 00:59:31,779
when we meet again after this.

1256
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:35,248
I feel like you'd be more relaxed.

1257
00:59:35,249 --> 00:59:37,578
That's what I think.

1258
00:59:37,579 --> 00:59:40,220
Now you're a little...

1259
00:59:40,879 --> 00:59:42,288
I wouldn't be...

1260
00:59:42,289 --> 00:59:43,350
- completely different. - Right.

1261
00:59:44,249 --> 00:59:48,260
It's true that I'm staying tense.

1262
00:59:49,329 --> 00:59:50,389
That's understandable.

1263
00:59:50,390 --> 00:59:52,660
Actually, I don't really get nervous.

1264
00:59:53,559 --> 00:59:55,668
I'm choosing my words carefully,

1265
00:59:55,669 --> 00:59:56,699
if I'm being honest.

1266
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:58,470
I can't be as spontaneous here.

1267
00:59:59,870 --> 01:00:02,839
- I know what you mean. - If it were my usual self,

1268
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:04,339
we would have already had...

1269
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:07,340
many conversations in Seoul. Really.

1270
01:00:08,209 --> 01:00:09,249
But...

1271
01:00:10,010 --> 01:00:11,850
- You're more careful. - A lot more.

1272
01:00:12,919 --> 01:00:15,320
And we have our siblings here.

1273
01:00:16,019 --> 01:00:19,189
It looks like you care a lot about Se Seung.

1274
01:00:19,519 --> 01:00:21,788
My brother doesn't care about me at all.

1275
01:00:21,789 --> 01:00:23,989
- He's just busy with his business. - I care a lot about her.

1276
01:00:23,990 --> 01:00:25,458
That's why I find Yun Jae interesting.

1277
01:00:25,459 --> 01:00:26,728
- Right? - Yes.

1278
01:00:26,729 --> 01:00:28,430
My brother is indeed interesting.

1279
01:00:29,269 --> 01:00:32,899
Your nose and eyes remind me of my mom.

1280
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:34,240
I miss my mom.

1281
01:00:35,470 --> 01:00:38,268
I heard what your mom's mission card meant that day.

1282
01:00:38,269 --> 01:00:39,309
Right.

1283
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:42,579
(On the day of the date in Gangwon Province)

1284
01:00:43,209 --> 01:00:47,749
(Ji Won's mom chose Young Woo as the perfect choice for Ji Won.)

1285
01:00:50,419 --> 01:00:52,760
The first reason why she chose him...

1286
01:00:52,859 --> 01:00:55,989
was because he set up the utensils as soon as he sat down.

1287
01:00:55,990 --> 01:00:57,059
I did that too.

1288
01:00:57,459 --> 01:00:58,998
You did too?

1289
01:00:58,999 --> 01:01:00,029
I took out the utensils...

1290
01:01:00,030 --> 01:01:01,328
- and passed them to him. - Really?

1291
01:01:01,329 --> 01:01:03,728
My knees were touching the drawer, so I was uncomfortable,

1292
01:01:03,729 --> 01:01:05,899
but I still opened it and gave them out.

1293
01:01:07,169 --> 01:01:09,839
(Jae Hyung sat right in front of the drawer,)

1294
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:11,910
(so he gave out utensils first.)

1295
01:01:12,709 --> 01:01:16,308
My mom also said, "The yellow guy seemed nice too."

1296
01:01:16,309 --> 01:01:17,378
(The yellow guy)

1297
01:01:17,379 --> 01:01:19,478
You were the yellow guy who grilled the meat for everyone.

1298
01:01:19,479 --> 01:01:21,989
She mentioned only two. You and Yong Woo.

1299
01:01:21,990 --> 01:01:23,119
- Really? - Yes.

1300
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:26,918
Since you look like an idol singer,

1301
01:01:26,919 --> 01:01:29,930
she must have thought you were popular.

1302
01:01:30,059 --> 01:01:31,328
But I'm not popular.

1303
01:01:31,329 --> 01:01:33,958
I don't look after people unless I want to.

1304
01:01:33,959 --> 01:01:35,999
You seemed like you were nice to everyone.

1305
01:01:36,769 --> 01:01:38,430
I'm just acting cute with people.

1306
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:40,899
I'm asking for their affection.

1307
01:01:42,870 --> 01:01:44,509
You like receiving affection?

1308
01:01:44,510 --> 01:01:45,609
I love it.

1309
01:01:46,709 --> 01:01:48,340
Affection, not attention.

1310
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:50,509
- They're a little different. - Affection is like this.

1311
01:01:50,510 --> 01:01:51,579
Yes. Like that.

1312
01:01:51,709 --> 01:01:53,620
- "Our Jae Hyung." - Right.

1313
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:55,149
I like that.

1314
01:01:55,450 --> 01:01:57,949
I feel shy when I suddenly get attention.

1315
01:01:57,950 --> 01:01:59,119
I can see that.

1316
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:00,688
You're different from Yong Woo.

1317
01:02:00,689 --> 01:02:01,759
He's like...

1318
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:04,260
He totally loves getting attention, right?

1319
01:02:04,829 --> 01:02:07,099
- Right. - His gestures are like this.

1320
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:08,799
- And he... - American gestures.

1321
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:10,469
When my mom said...

1322
01:02:10,470 --> 01:02:11,768
he looked the calmest,

1323
01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:14,399
I was thinking, "No. He's the most talkative one."

1324
01:02:14,570 --> 01:02:16,639
You know he talks a lot.

1325
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:18,439
- He's super talkative. - Goodness.

1326
01:02:19,510 --> 01:02:22,578
When you moved into the dorm,

1327
01:02:22,579 --> 01:02:27,379
were you set on finding someone to date?

1328
01:02:27,550 --> 01:02:30,648
Were you determined...

1329
01:02:30,649 --> 01:02:32,890
to find someone to date?

1330
01:02:33,059 --> 01:02:35,430
I was a little extreme about it.

1331
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:39,058
I thought if things went well, I'd marry the person.

1332
01:02:39,059 --> 01:02:40,300
Marry?

1333
01:02:41,530 --> 01:02:42,570
Really?

1334
01:02:44,070 --> 01:02:46,038
That must've made you more careful.

1335
01:02:46,039 --> 01:02:47,039
That was why.

1336
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:50,139
Seriously,

1337
01:02:50,140 --> 01:02:51,668
I must've been the most cautious.

1338
01:02:51,669 --> 01:02:52,909
Me too.

1339
01:02:52,910 --> 01:02:55,949
I don't want to date someone...

1340
01:02:55,950 --> 01:02:58,919
just because I'm a little into them.

1341
01:02:59,620 --> 01:03:01,679
If I'm going to date someone,

1342
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:04,648
I want them to be someone I can picture a future with...

1343
01:03:04,649 --> 01:03:08,188
even if it's not marriage.

1344
01:03:08,189 --> 01:03:10,558
That's why I was stressed out...

1345
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:12,728
in the middle.

1346
01:03:12,729 --> 01:03:15,200
- For a moment, I thought... - What?

1347
01:03:16,669 --> 01:03:19,840
- What? You don't want to go back? - I didn't want to go back.

1348
01:03:20,439 --> 01:03:21,499
Me neither.

1349
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:28,680
I did feel like time was flying.

1350
01:03:28,950 --> 01:03:29,950
Actually,

1351
01:03:30,979 --> 01:03:34,019
that day, I was sad about a date for the first time.

1352
01:03:34,579 --> 01:03:36,849
I thought it was a shame.

1353
01:03:36,850 --> 01:03:38,820
(I thought it was a shame.)

1354
01:03:38,959 --> 01:03:42,089
I had so much fun on a date with him.

1355
01:03:42,090 --> 01:03:44,288
I thought I wanted to go on more dates with him,

1356
01:03:44,289 --> 01:03:45,659
and I hoped...

1357
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:47,958
I would have more opportunities...

1358
01:03:47,959 --> 01:03:50,469
to go out with him in Singapore.

1359
01:03:50,470 --> 01:03:53,268
I believe we need enough time...

1360
01:03:53,269 --> 01:03:56,209
to learn more about each other.

1361
01:03:56,709 --> 01:03:59,978
You drank so fast.

1362
01:03:59,979 --> 01:04:01,978
You drank more than me.

1363
01:04:01,979 --> 01:04:03,309
If you say so, it's true.

1364
01:04:04,010 --> 01:04:06,019
We must turn these on when we go in.

1365
01:04:06,249 --> 01:04:08,620
Sure. Ask me when you want to take that off.

1366
01:04:10,350 --> 01:04:11,490
- Shall we get going? - Yes.

1367
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:13,490
I had fun today.

1368
01:04:13,620 --> 01:04:16,229
I had the most fun today since I moved in.

1369
01:04:16,390 --> 01:04:19,229
(Ending the day by taking photos)

1370
01:04:26,470 --> 01:04:28,709
(Heading home)

1371
01:04:35,579 --> 01:04:38,450
(Cho A and Yong Woo are going home.)

1372
01:04:39,579 --> 01:04:41,149
(Struggling)

1373
01:04:42,090 --> 01:04:43,120
Let me...

1374
01:04:43,649 --> 01:04:45,320
(Exclaiming)

1375
01:04:45,689 --> 01:04:46,859
You're indeed different.

1376
01:04:47,789 --> 01:04:49,129
I was going to force it in.

1377
01:04:49,229 --> 01:04:50,829
But your hands had no strength at all.

1378
01:04:53,359 --> 01:04:54,430
By the way,

1379
01:04:55,030 --> 01:04:57,169
- I had... - Yes.

1380
01:04:57,999 --> 01:05:00,070
relatively more opportunities...

1381
01:05:01,140 --> 01:05:03,470
- to go on dates with others. - Yes.

1382
01:05:04,269 --> 01:05:07,878
But I don't think you did.

1383
01:05:07,879 --> 01:05:09,209
Right.

1384
01:05:09,479 --> 01:05:12,820
Aren't you sad that you didn't get to go out with other people?

1385
01:05:13,220 --> 01:05:14,579
Well...

1386
01:05:15,079 --> 01:05:17,450
I'd be lying if I said I never thought of it.

1387
01:05:18,419 --> 01:05:20,418
We did have a good time...

1388
01:05:20,419 --> 01:05:23,760
and had a lot of talk since yesterday.

1389
01:05:24,260 --> 01:05:26,529
But it's not like we're not allowed...

1390
01:05:26,530 --> 01:05:28,929
to go on dates with other people here.

1391
01:05:28,930 --> 01:05:29,970
Right.

1392
01:05:30,669 --> 01:05:33,700
We were all given equal opportunities.

1393
01:05:34,370 --> 01:05:37,208
So I wondered if you didn't have many chances.

1394
01:05:37,209 --> 01:05:38,839
- It suddenly popped into my head. - Chances?

1395
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:41,639
Yes. I suddenly became curious.

1396
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:42,979
I see.

1397
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:45,579
Well...

1398
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:49,550
I did think about going out with other people.

1399
01:05:51,919 --> 01:05:52,990
But I kept making...

1400
01:05:55,189 --> 01:05:56,390
the same decision.

1401
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:03,030
(Smiling)

1402
01:06:03,570 --> 01:06:05,069
- Why? - I just thought...

1403
01:06:05,070 --> 01:06:06,498
we were similar in that sense.

1404
01:06:06,499 --> 01:06:09,840
We did think about it but kept making...

1405
01:06:11,370 --> 01:06:12,510
similar decisions.

1406
01:06:13,479 --> 01:06:14,479
Yes.

1407
01:06:15,309 --> 01:06:18,078
I think I wanted to try your way.

1408
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:20,180
I recall you said...

1409
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:22,419
that you liked feeling secure.

1410
01:06:23,490 --> 01:06:25,120
So I tried...

1411
01:06:26,289 --> 01:06:28,929
to impress you that way...

1412
01:06:28,930 --> 01:06:30,729
by being a better version of myself.

1413
01:06:30,859 --> 01:06:32,559
- Is that so? - Now that I think about it.

1414
01:06:32,959 --> 01:06:36,029
So, you're usually not like that,

1415
01:06:36,030 --> 01:06:39,169
but since I prefer feeling secure,

1416
01:06:39,399 --> 01:06:43,108
so you made an effort by doing so?

1417
01:06:43,109 --> 01:06:44,308
A little.

1418
01:06:44,309 --> 01:06:46,439
By being consistent.

1419
01:06:47,079 --> 01:06:49,550
I wondered later if that was what I was doing.

1420
01:06:49,850 --> 01:06:51,979
I had that thought yesterday when we came here.

1421
01:06:52,479 --> 01:06:54,119
Would it sound funny if I called it an opportunity?

1422
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:56,050
You didn't really have many opportunities, right?

1423
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:59,320
I had a thought like that too.

1424
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:01,390
- It was like... - Yes?

1425
01:07:02,329 --> 01:07:04,959
- People who are here... - Yes.

1426
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:07,829
- might think... - Okay.

1427
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:10,499
you already made a decision.

1428
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:12,999
I think they might think that way.

1429
01:07:13,070 --> 01:07:14,870
- Based on what they see? - Based on what they see.

1430
01:07:16,709 --> 01:07:18,239
The show isn't over,

1431
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:21,209
but I suddenly thought it became obvious for them...

1432
01:07:21,510 --> 01:07:22,550
in a way.

1433
01:07:22,649 --> 01:07:25,410
Isn't that what you think?

1434
01:07:25,749 --> 01:07:26,780
- Me? - Yes.

1435
01:07:27,450 --> 01:07:28,680
No, I...

1436
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:33,120
I'm worried they might treat you like that.

1437
01:07:33,689 --> 01:07:34,919
- Treat me like that? - Yes.

1438
01:07:35,530 --> 01:07:36,789
Treat me like that?

1439
01:07:37,590 --> 01:07:39,699
But while I was spending time together today,

1440
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:42,100
I thought I had made an excellent choice.

1441
01:07:42,570 --> 01:07:43,599
- Today? - Yes.

1442
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:45,269
I had so much fun.

1443
01:07:47,970 --> 01:07:49,539
- I had fun today too. - Yes.

1444
01:07:50,740 --> 01:07:52,640
It's nice that you talk about things like this.

1445
01:07:53,340 --> 01:07:54,910
I thought you would like to hear my opinions.

1446
01:07:55,340 --> 01:07:58,809
Because you know...

1447
01:07:59,220 --> 01:08:02,550
I rarely talk about my opinion about something.

1448
01:08:03,590 --> 01:08:07,760
You said I looked like I'd take action instead of talking.

1449
01:08:08,190 --> 01:08:11,360
- Yes. - So I thought I would talk too.

1450
01:08:12,029 --> 01:08:13,659
- That's what I thought. - Oh, that was why?

1451
01:08:13,860 --> 01:08:15,669
So I just...

1452
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:17,829
shared my opinion.

1453
01:08:19,739 --> 01:08:21,400
I'm touched.

1454
01:08:21,499 --> 01:08:23,340
I didn't say it to move your heart.

1455
01:08:26,110 --> 01:08:27,110
Still, I was touched.

1456
01:08:30,010 --> 01:08:32,050
- Actually, yesterday, - Yes.

1457
01:08:33,180 --> 01:08:36,248
I thought you might be conflicting...

1458
01:08:36,249 --> 01:08:37,919
between me and someone.

1459
01:08:38,249 --> 01:08:40,489
- Me? - Yes.

1460
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:42,730
I'm not sure.

1461
01:08:50,169 --> 01:08:51,829
I did think about this, though.

1462
01:08:52,669 --> 01:08:53,699
The hideout...

1463
01:08:55,069 --> 01:08:56,509
You should get out now.

1464
01:08:56,510 --> 01:08:57,839
Should we?

1465
01:08:57,840 --> 01:08:59,238
(They should get out of the car.)

1466
01:08:59,239 --> 01:09:00,610
- We should get out? - Yes.

1467
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:04,408
(She arrived at the house before hearing his words.)

1468
01:09:04,409 --> 01:09:05,510
Thank you.

1469
01:09:07,980 --> 01:09:10,220
- Your brother has come. - Oh, my.

1470
01:09:11,749 --> 01:09:13,318
- What's up? - What's up?

1471
01:09:13,319 --> 01:09:14,619
I brought something to eat for you.

1472
01:09:14,919 --> 01:09:16,760
(Se Seung and Jung Sub came back.)

1473
01:09:17,390 --> 01:09:19,260
Goodbye.

1474
01:09:19,699 --> 01:09:21,158
It was so much fun.

1475
01:09:21,159 --> 01:09:22,400
It's our house.

1476
01:09:23,629 --> 01:09:24,668
Hi.

1477
01:09:24,669 --> 01:09:25,939
- Hi. - You've come.

1478
01:09:25,940 --> 01:09:27,069
Hi.

1479
01:09:31,810 --> 01:09:34,640
(Thinking hard)

1480
01:09:35,949 --> 01:09:38,610
I don't know what it means.

1481
01:09:41,150 --> 01:09:42,720
"I want to know your past,"

1482
01:09:44,190 --> 01:09:46,060
"but I don't know what kind of feeling this is."

1483
01:09:46,260 --> 01:09:48,159
Why does it make him upset...

1484
01:09:48,819 --> 01:09:51,060
that he's curious about my past?

1485
01:09:51,659 --> 01:09:54,029
Because I might've done the same things in the past?

1486
01:09:55,260 --> 01:09:56,470
Is that why he doesn't like it?

1487
01:09:59,470 --> 01:10:01,698
I don't know what he meant by that.

1488
01:10:01,699 --> 01:10:04,539
I want to know what will happen to us in the future.

1489
01:10:04,970 --> 01:10:07,779
Why is he curious about my past?

1490
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:12,208
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1491
01:10:12,209 --> 01:10:13,720
- Good night. - Good night.

1492
01:10:14,079 --> 01:10:15,079
Let's go.

1493
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:16,850
It was really a therapeutic moment.

1494
01:10:17,220 --> 01:10:19,118
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1495
01:10:19,119 --> 01:10:20,119
(Ji Won and Jae Hyung also arrived at the house.)

1496
01:10:20,959 --> 01:10:21,989
Oh, what is it?

1497
01:10:22,459 --> 01:10:24,158
Dad Yong Woo?

1498
01:10:24,159 --> 01:10:26,259
- Hello. - Hello.

1499
01:10:26,260 --> 01:10:27,629
Should we do this before we go?

1500
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:29,369
Oh, right.

1501
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:32,440
- Does it fly like this? - Fly.

1502
01:10:33,539 --> 01:10:35,440
You're supposed to do the second one.

1503
01:10:35,909 --> 01:10:36,940
Sorry.

1504
01:10:38,909 --> 01:10:40,940
Jung Sub has come. It means...

1505
01:10:44,010 --> 01:10:45,209
What? Where is she?

1506
01:10:45,749 --> 01:10:46,850
(Wriggling)

1507
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:48,720
What's that?

1508
01:10:49,090 --> 01:10:51,590
I'm embarrassed to wear this here.

1509
01:10:51,850 --> 01:10:54,690
Where did you go? Did you have fun?

1510
01:10:55,390 --> 01:10:56,390
Yes.

1511
01:10:56,730 --> 01:10:57,730
A different kind of fun?

1512
01:10:58,989 --> 01:11:00,360
(Laughing)

1513
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:04,270
I don't know.

1514
01:11:05,199 --> 01:11:06,239
It's a secret.

1515
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:08,270
I drew a picture.

1516
01:11:10,270 --> 01:11:12,909
Did you draw a picture when you went to make chocolate?

1517
01:11:13,579 --> 01:11:14,680
That's chocolate.

1518
01:11:15,340 --> 01:11:19,279
Just by the picture, it suits Ju Yeon more.

1519
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:20,578
- You think so? - Yes.

1520
01:11:20,579 --> 01:11:24,119
I thought it suited Ji Won.

1521
01:11:24,319 --> 01:11:26,119
You could think like that.

1522
01:11:26,919 --> 01:11:29,759
I've never taken a photo with Ji Won...

1523
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:30,890
before today.

1524
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:33,129
Did you guys talk a lot?

1525
01:11:33,730 --> 01:11:35,128
We talked a lot.

1526
01:11:35,129 --> 01:11:36,198
- You did? - Yes.

1527
01:11:36,199 --> 01:11:37,600
- Ji Won? - Yes. She's unexpectedly funny.

1528
01:11:37,699 --> 01:11:38,970
It's fun when it's just the two of us.

1529
01:11:39,029 --> 01:11:40,600
- Right. - I should've...

1530
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:43,270
met her earlier.

1531
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:47,510
I should've talked with her earlier.

1532
01:11:47,610 --> 01:11:50,448
You can't get to know her well when you're in a group.

1533
01:11:50,449 --> 01:11:51,909
She's hard to read.

1534
01:11:52,819 --> 01:11:55,279
You wanted to talk more, but you cut it off and came, right?

1535
01:11:56,119 --> 01:11:58,150
- Yes. - Really?

1536
01:11:58,690 --> 01:12:00,418
- I... - Because you clicked?

1537
01:12:00,419 --> 01:12:03,560
- So... - Is it because you were attracted?

1538
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:06,629
I wanted to talk with her.

1539
01:12:06,959 --> 01:12:08,860
- Right. You should feel that way. - You know...

1540
01:12:09,230 --> 01:12:11,800
my tendency.

1541
01:12:12,699 --> 01:12:14,739
I'm not good at hiding feelings.

1542
01:12:15,239 --> 01:12:17,908
I can't pretend...

1543
01:12:17,909 --> 01:12:20,708
when I don't feel that way.

1544
01:12:20,709 --> 01:12:22,110
- That's my personality. - Right.

1545
01:12:22,409 --> 01:12:24,850
But today, I genuinely wanted to talk with her more.

1546
01:12:25,379 --> 01:12:27,778
How long do you think you would need...

1547
01:12:27,779 --> 01:12:29,079
to be sure about your feelings?

1548
01:12:29,550 --> 01:12:30,590
I don't need more time.

1549
01:12:31,749 --> 01:12:33,559
- "I don't need it." - He doesn't need it.

1550
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:37,259
He was careful before.

1551
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:38,860
He doesn't need to be anymore.

1552
01:12:39,060 --> 01:12:40,629
Only a day is enough.

1553
01:12:40,999 --> 01:12:43,429
How long do you think you would need...

1554
01:12:43,430 --> 01:12:44,699
to be sure about your feelings?

1555
01:12:45,069 --> 01:12:46,069
I don't need more time.

1556
01:12:46,070 --> 01:12:47,100
- Really? - Yes.

1557
01:12:48,940 --> 01:12:50,668
My prediction was right after all.

1558
01:12:50,669 --> 01:12:53,839
I should get to know more...

1559
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:55,309
- You should get to know more. - about her.

1560
01:12:55,310 --> 01:12:56,349
- Because... - Right.

1561
01:12:56,350 --> 01:12:58,208
- you can't show everything, - True.

1562
01:12:58,209 --> 01:12:59,349
- to be honest. - That's true.

1563
01:12:59,350 --> 01:13:03,449
Despite that, I'm quite sure about my feelings for now.

1564
01:13:04,919 --> 01:13:06,059
But I don't know.

1565
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:08,520
She liked me more than I had thought.

1566
01:13:10,529 --> 01:13:11,789
- Right. - It got me surprised.

1567
01:13:11,890 --> 01:13:13,800
You catch feelings...

1568
01:13:14,129 --> 01:13:15,729
before you know it...

1569
01:13:15,730 --> 01:13:18,369
- if they're the right one. - That's why I was so surprised.

1570
01:13:18,999 --> 01:13:22,499
That's why I was more surprised. Is that possible?

1571
01:13:22,869 --> 01:13:23,869
But when I think about it,

1572
01:13:23,870 --> 01:13:24,970
- it's possible for me. - It is.

1573
01:13:25,169 --> 01:13:26,909
- It's possible for me. - Right.

1574
01:13:27,010 --> 01:13:28,639
So it'd be possible for her too.

1575
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:31,550
That's why I should hurry up and go to Seoul now.

1576
01:13:31,650 --> 01:13:32,949
I really can't stand something like this.

1577
01:13:33,379 --> 01:13:34,819
I'm tired.

1578
01:13:35,150 --> 01:13:36,249
You must be.

1579
01:13:36,350 --> 01:13:38,419
You should eat a proper meal.

1580
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:40,259
Yong Woo said he felt better...

1581
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:41,418
after eating.

1582
01:13:41,419 --> 01:13:42,658
- He did? - Yes.

1583
01:13:42,659 --> 01:13:45,760
He's such a disloyal guy to eat by himself without me.

1584
01:13:47,459 --> 01:13:48,659
I don't know.

1585
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:53,069
This is the last thing he said.

1586
01:13:53,270 --> 01:13:55,069
"I think you don't have other opportunities..."

1587
01:13:55,569 --> 01:14:00,510
"because you only go out with me."

1588
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:03,510
It sounded ambiguous to me.

1589
01:14:04,709 --> 01:14:05,809
- I understand that. - Yes.

1590
01:14:05,810 --> 01:14:07,278
So I said,

1591
01:14:07,279 --> 01:14:09,179
"It feels like you're conflicting..."

1592
01:14:09,180 --> 01:14:13,059
"between me and someone."

1593
01:14:13,060 --> 01:14:16,659
Our conversation ended before he answered.

1594
01:14:17,060 --> 01:14:18,429
He said this too.

1595
01:14:18,430 --> 01:14:21,359
I said I liked someone...

1596
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:24,799
who made me...

1597
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:26,369
feel secured.

1598
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:29,868
So he might've sent me messages...

1599
01:14:29,869 --> 01:14:32,039
to make me feel that way.

1600
01:14:33,239 --> 01:14:34,239
Someone is coming upstairs.

1601
01:14:36,079 --> 01:14:38,079
He doesn't want to make it obvious...

1602
01:14:38,409 --> 01:14:40,549
- when there are other people. - Right.

1603
01:14:40,550 --> 01:14:43,520
He's nice to everyone.

1604
01:14:43,890 --> 01:14:46,560
I don't know how to say it.

1605
01:14:47,060 --> 01:14:49,019
- You feel left out? - Yes. I feel that way a little.

1606
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:52,230
"He's been sending me messages,"

1607
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:56,129
"but he doesn't want to make it obvious to others."

1608
01:14:57,069 --> 01:15:00,069
So I have complicated feelings.

1609
01:15:00,869 --> 01:15:02,199
He doesn't want to make it obvious?

1610
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:04,969
It seems he doesn't like to show others...

1611
01:15:04,970 --> 01:15:07,038
that he's interested in someone.

1612
01:15:07,039 --> 01:15:09,510
He should've not given her the flowers then.

1613
01:15:09,610 --> 01:15:11,149
He gave her flowers.

1614
01:15:11,150 --> 01:15:12,510
He made it very obvious.

1615
01:15:12,850 --> 01:15:14,918
The flowers hold different meanings...

1616
01:15:14,919 --> 01:15:16,118
- for Yong Woo... - Right.

1617
01:15:16,119 --> 01:15:17,488
- and Cho A. - Yes.

1618
01:15:17,489 --> 01:15:18,918
- It holds very different meanings. - Yes.

1619
01:15:18,919 --> 01:15:21,089
All the things she's thinking hard...

1620
01:15:21,090 --> 01:15:23,230
and feeling unsure about...

1621
01:15:23,590 --> 01:15:25,729
are actually right.

1622
01:15:25,730 --> 01:15:27,759
- She's not mistaken. - You're right.

1623
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:29,060
That's how Yong Woo feels.

1624
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:31,669
That's sad.

1625
01:15:32,499 --> 01:15:34,640
I have two sides.

1626
01:15:35,069 --> 01:15:37,440
Everyone is like that. We all have two sides.

1627
01:15:37,739 --> 01:15:39,778
His independent side...

1628
01:15:39,779 --> 01:15:43,208
is attractive to me,

1629
01:15:43,209 --> 01:15:45,479
but at the same time, I want him to rely on me.

1630
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:46,948
I'm a little upset...

1631
01:15:46,949 --> 01:15:48,819
when he doesn't.

1632
01:15:49,279 --> 01:15:50,349
- I'm exactly like that. - Yes.

1633
01:15:50,350 --> 01:15:51,890
You're that type of person.

1634
01:15:51,989 --> 01:15:53,059
- Right. - Yes.

1635
01:15:53,060 --> 01:15:55,119
He and you are really alike.

1636
01:15:55,220 --> 01:15:57,789
But I don't want to date someone like you.

1637
01:15:57,989 --> 01:16:00,529
Right. I wouldn't want to date someone like me either.

1638
01:16:00,860 --> 01:16:03,829
- I wouldn't want it too. - Was I being too honest?

1639
01:16:04,129 --> 01:16:07,039
No. I think I'm like that type of person.

1640
01:16:07,140 --> 01:16:10,238
There are many good things about you too. But...

1641
01:16:10,239 --> 01:16:12,439
In my opinion, you want others...

1642
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:14,379
to tell you everything no matter how trivial it is.

1643
01:16:15,310 --> 01:16:16,350
That's why we're not compatible.

1644
01:16:17,810 --> 01:16:19,719
- That's why... - That's why I'm tired.

1645
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:20,850
- I'm tired too. - It's tiring.

1646
01:16:22,050 --> 01:16:23,050
I hope you meet a nice person.

1647
01:16:28,619 --> 01:16:30,159
- I know. - I agree.

1648
01:16:31,390 --> 01:16:33,930
What's that? The shining thing?

1649
01:16:34,029 --> 01:16:35,100
- This? - Yes.

1650
01:16:36,629 --> 01:16:38,869
It's for a pet dog.

1651
01:16:39,069 --> 01:16:40,999
- A pet dog? - When you walk a dog at night,

1652
01:16:41,470 --> 01:16:42,599
you can see it better with this.

1653
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:43,609
So you're a dog?

1654
01:16:43,610 --> 01:16:45,769
Which one was the dog?

1655
01:16:45,770 --> 01:16:47,709
One of us was the dog.

1656
01:16:47,810 --> 01:16:48,839
I wonder.

1657
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:52,480
He did the NewJeans dance, saying that I looked like them.

1658
01:16:52,579 --> 01:16:54,549
- It suits my outfit today. - You...

1659
01:16:54,550 --> 01:16:55,550
look like NewJeans.

1660
01:16:57,419 --> 01:16:59,190
- Now... - Oh, my gosh

1661
01:16:59,619 --> 01:17:01,259
Do you want to put me in danger?

1662
01:17:01,260 --> 01:17:03,390
What's this move, though? Do they have a move like this?

1663
01:17:03,489 --> 01:17:05,890
- It's "OMG." - "OMG?" It's more like...

1664
01:17:08,199 --> 01:17:09,629
Is it like this?

1665
01:17:09,730 --> 01:17:11,069
You try it.

1666
01:17:12,329 --> 01:17:14,100
- Oh, my. - That's boxing. It's the guard.

1667
01:17:14,199 --> 01:17:15,270
- Oh, my. - Gosh.

1668
01:17:15,470 --> 01:17:16,539
Oh, my gosh.

1669
01:17:17,940 --> 01:17:19,169
What's this?

1670
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:21,679
(NewJeans who became boxers)

1671
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:22,709
Oh, my gosh.

1672
01:17:22,949 --> 01:17:23,949
It's "Oh, my gosh" for real.

1673
01:17:23,950 --> 01:17:25,510
- It's really "Oh, my gosh." - Oh, my gosh.

1674
01:17:26,949 --> 01:17:28,720
- Oh, my - Oh, my

1675
01:17:29,249 --> 01:17:30,449
Did you do the NewJeans dance today?

1676
01:17:31,590 --> 01:17:32,860
- Sorry. - The dance I taught you yesterday?

1677
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:34,859
- Not that. - Not that?

1678
01:17:34,860 --> 01:17:36,730
- It was "OMG." - "OMG."

1679
01:17:36,829 --> 01:17:39,390
- "OMG?" - But I got the move wrong.

1680
01:17:40,060 --> 01:17:41,698
- That's the move. - That's the move?

1681
01:17:41,699 --> 01:17:43,100
Do you do it with one hand?

1682
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:45,569
I thought it was this move.

1683
01:17:45,869 --> 01:17:46,970
That's a little...

1684
01:17:47,069 --> 01:17:48,339
- That's silly. - Oh, my.

1685
01:17:48,340 --> 01:17:49,809
That's funny.

1686
01:17:49,810 --> 01:17:51,068
- He always dances like that. - Oh, you're right.

1687
01:17:51,069 --> 01:17:52,109
I was mistaken.

1688
01:17:52,110 --> 01:17:53,339
I know what it is.

1689
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:55,679
(You have 4 days before making the final decision.)

1690
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:58,810
(Who made your heart flutter today?)

1691
01:18:10,690 --> 01:18:13,158
(Cho A)

1692
01:18:13,159 --> 01:18:15,559
I was sorry and thankful.

1693
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:16,629
So I wrote about it.

1694
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:18,300
I think I wrote it several times.

1695
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:20,800
If I text her like that again,

1696
01:18:21,199 --> 01:18:23,739
it might make her uncomfortable.

1697
01:18:45,430 --> 01:18:48,730
I sent a message to Ji Won and asked her if she had fun today.

1698
01:18:49,869 --> 01:18:52,300
I actually contemplated a lot.

1699
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:54,969
I was wondering if it was the right thing...

1700
01:18:54,970 --> 01:18:56,209
to text Jae Hyung.

1701
01:19:03,949 --> 01:19:06,418
I didn't text her...

1702
01:19:06,419 --> 01:19:07,779
because of the circumstances.

1703
01:19:08,050 --> 01:19:09,649
It was the first time...

1704
01:19:09,650 --> 01:19:12,449
I felt like I should text her, regardless of the situation.

1705
01:19:16,989 --> 01:19:20,800
(The first messages with their hearts in Singapore were sent.)

1706
01:19:26,940 --> 01:19:28,599
(What we had in the cafe was good. Our date was fun.)

1707
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:30,269
(Even the izakaya was perfect.)

1708
01:19:30,270 --> 01:19:31,969
(It was nice that I could hear more about you too.)

1709
01:19:31,970 --> 01:19:33,679
At first, we sent each other messages...

1710
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:35,179
like we want to get to know...

1711
01:19:35,180 --> 01:19:36,850
each other.

1712
01:19:36,909 --> 01:19:38,980
Now, it feels like this.

1713
01:19:39,079 --> 01:19:41,249
"It's obvious that I'm going to text you,"

1714
01:19:41,579 --> 01:19:43,288
"so let me tell you about what I liked about today."

1715
01:19:43,289 --> 01:19:44,390
It felt like that was what he was saying.

1716
01:19:45,249 --> 01:19:46,319
It was cute.

1717
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:51,930
I summarized our date today.

1718
01:19:52,129 --> 01:19:53,929
I wrote it was the best date.

1719
01:19:53,930 --> 01:19:55,300
I sent her a message like this.

1720
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:58,669
It's like...

1721
01:19:59,770 --> 01:20:01,399
(Talking to you is my favourite thing to do.)

1722
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:03,469
(Let's do everything we want to do here before we go back!)

1723
01:20:03,470 --> 01:20:06,239
"I enjoy talking to you the most." I wrote this at first.

1724
01:20:06,340 --> 01:20:08,579
Then I thought I like it rather than I enjoy it.

1725
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:10,180
I wanted to express that.

1726
01:20:16,489 --> 01:20:19,249
(I'm sorry I left you with the parrot.)

1727
01:20:19,789 --> 01:20:22,589
Her text felt like the perfect ending...

1728
01:20:22,590 --> 01:20:23,629
to my day.

1729
01:20:24,730 --> 01:20:25,789
It made me so happy.

1730
01:20:30,169 --> 01:20:33,640
(Let's not have a regretful moment here.)

1731
01:20:33,940 --> 01:20:36,038
I texted Jae Hyung.

1732
01:20:36,039 --> 01:20:39,708
In the last message I sent him in Seoul before we came to Singapore,

1733
01:20:39,709 --> 01:20:42,709
I expressed my regrets.

1734
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:44,980
"I don't want to have a regretful moment..."

1735
01:20:45,550 --> 01:20:48,650
"when I go out with you in Singapore."

1736
01:20:48,980 --> 01:20:50,690
That's what I wrote.

1737
01:20:51,090 --> 01:20:52,748
Going out with him,

1738
01:20:52,749 --> 01:20:56,360
I thought he had a personality...

1739
01:20:56,760 --> 01:21:00,399
I'm instinctively attracted to.

1740
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:03,669
I wanted to have many chances...

1741
01:21:03,869 --> 01:21:06,999
to go out with him in Singapore.

1742
01:21:07,270 --> 01:21:11,010
I got to like him more after we spent some time together.

1743
01:21:15,140 --> 01:21:19,409
(It's raining.)

1744
01:21:20,919 --> 01:21:22,180
I received one more text.

1745
01:21:23,819 --> 01:21:24,890
It was from Ju Yeon.

1746
01:21:27,890 --> 01:21:29,390
I texted Jae Hyung.

1747
01:21:29,659 --> 01:21:32,389
My first date in Singapore was with him.

1748
01:21:32,390 --> 01:21:34,230
And he made a poem.

1749
01:21:35,260 --> 01:21:37,230
(Rain, wind)

1750
01:21:37,329 --> 01:21:38,869
It kept raining.

1751
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:41,869
So we listened to a song called "Rain."

1752
01:21:41,970 --> 01:21:43,610
I really liked the song.

1753
01:21:44,470 --> 01:21:47,509
That's why I sent "It's, raining..."

1754
01:21:47,510 --> 01:21:49,779
with a comma.

1755
01:21:50,310 --> 01:21:52,850
We didn't talk much on that day,

1756
01:21:52,949 --> 01:21:56,279
so I texted him, thinking about our date.

1757
01:21:57,289 --> 01:21:58,919
I was happy when I received a text from Ji Won.

1758
01:21:59,550 --> 01:22:01,419
My heart became heavy after receiving a text from Ju Yeon.

1759
01:22:01,919 --> 01:22:03,560
I was very worried.

1760
01:22:03,989 --> 01:22:05,930
She was in the house by herself that day.

1761
01:22:06,129 --> 01:22:07,900
She didn't go out on a date.

1762
01:22:08,699 --> 01:22:11,300
I thought she would be very upset.

1763
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:14,369
Because it would've seemed that I was happy after going out with her,

1764
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:19,369
and that I had a lot of fun with Ji Won.

1765
01:22:22,279 --> 01:22:25,779
(Ji Won and Ju Yeon chose your sibling.)

1766
01:22:26,110 --> 01:22:29,349
It must've made him uncomfortable.

1767
01:22:29,350 --> 01:22:31,150
I thought he would feel sorry.

1768
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:34,659
I think he's curious about Ji Won and wants to get to know her.

1769
01:22:35,020 --> 01:22:39,029
And there's a romantic interest too.

1770
01:22:40,159 --> 01:22:45,199
(The two sent their hearts to Jae Hyung.)

1771
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:52,209
(Where does his heart lie?)

1772
01:22:58,050 --> 01:23:03,489
(Make sure to wear suspenders.)

1773
01:23:03,789 --> 01:23:07,560
I said I brought suspenders...

1774
01:23:07,959 --> 01:23:09,619
during our date.

1775
01:23:09,930 --> 01:23:12,260
I brought...

1776
01:23:12,629 --> 01:23:14,499
suspenders.

1777
01:23:15,260 --> 01:23:16,569
But I can't wear them.

1778
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:18,668
Can you please wear them?

1779
01:23:18,669 --> 01:23:20,239
I think they will suit you.

1780
01:23:20,340 --> 01:23:21,669
What are you going to wear tomorrow?

1781
01:23:21,999 --> 01:23:23,068
Tomorrow?

1782
01:23:23,069 --> 01:23:24,440
- Should I wear the suspenders? - Yes.

1783
01:23:26,980 --> 01:23:29,340
I think she'd look cute with suspenders.

1784
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:32,149
And since we talked about it,

1785
01:23:32,150 --> 01:23:34,319
I wanted to make it obvious that it was me who texted her.

1786
01:23:34,749 --> 01:23:38,389
I had so much fun during our date.

1787
01:23:38,390 --> 01:23:40,659
It really felt like a date.

1788
01:23:40,919 --> 01:23:42,819
I enjoyed it the most.

1789
01:23:44,230 --> 01:23:46,760
It was the first time I was interested in someone...

1790
01:23:46,860 --> 01:23:49,658
and attracted by her...

1791
01:23:49,659 --> 01:23:50,869
after I joined the show.

1792
01:23:51,329 --> 01:23:54,339
So I texted her because I really wanted to send her a message,

1793
01:23:54,340 --> 01:23:56,610
not because I had to make a choice.

1794
01:23:58,340 --> 01:24:00,110
Why did you look at it at that moment?

1795
01:24:00,709 --> 01:24:02,879
I had a peek.

1796
01:24:03,949 --> 01:24:05,010
I thought it was a dinosaur.

1797
01:24:06,209 --> 01:24:09,119
Jae Hyung always treats me in the same way.

1798
01:24:09,890 --> 01:24:12,919
Whether he sent me a text or not, his attitude doesn't change.

1799
01:24:13,020 --> 01:24:15,759
At first, it was a little confusing.

1800
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:16,929
I was very confused.

1801
01:24:16,930 --> 01:24:18,759
But I think it's better that way.

1802
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:21,629
Because I can be more comfortable around him...

1803
01:24:22,029 --> 01:24:24,369
and not be too sensitive about it.

1804
01:24:25,129 --> 01:24:26,899
- As expected... - Still?

1805
01:24:26,900 --> 01:24:27,900
Yes.

1806
01:24:28,539 --> 01:24:31,569
(No one chose your sibling.)

1807
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:35,039
I didn't feel good, to be honest.

1808
01:24:35,610 --> 01:24:38,010
But I like that Ju Yeon is honest about her feelings...

1809
01:24:38,209 --> 01:24:41,919
even when she didn't receive a text.

1810
01:24:42,020 --> 01:24:46,390
The remaining time is shorter than the time that has passed,

1811
01:24:46,489 --> 01:24:47,819
but if there's a chance,

1812
01:24:47,860 --> 01:24:50,129
I will not hesitate to help her.

1813
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:56,600
(Did you have a good time today?)

1814
01:24:57,300 --> 01:25:00,140
It was probably Cheol Hyeon.

1815
01:25:00,569 --> 01:25:03,140
I couldn't have a proper date with her.

1816
01:25:03,539 --> 01:25:05,770
"Even if things don't work until we leave,"

1817
01:25:05,869 --> 01:25:07,680
"I'll keep texting her."

1818
01:25:07,879 --> 01:25:09,709
That's what I thought when I sent her the message.

1819
01:25:10,150 --> 01:25:12,378
They said he and I looked like siblings.

1820
01:25:12,379 --> 01:25:14,749
Everything works for me.

1821
01:25:16,419 --> 01:25:21,619
(I had fun today as always. I hope you recover quickly.)

1822
01:25:23,390 --> 01:25:25,230
I texted Yong Woo.

1823
01:25:26,289 --> 01:25:28,699
"I had fun today. I hope you recover quickly."

1824
01:25:29,730 --> 01:25:31,599
I think it was a heart-warming message.

1825
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:34,669
But I was preoccupied with something else at that moment.

1826
01:25:35,239 --> 01:25:37,669
I think she sent me a heart-warming message.

1827
01:25:45,079 --> 01:25:48,579
(Should I make kimchi for you?)

1828
01:25:48,850 --> 01:25:52,919
"Should I make kimchi for you?" I received a text like this.

1829
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:55,889
- What? - What?

1830
01:25:55,890 --> 01:25:57,389
- "Should I make kimchi for you?" - "Should I make kimchi for you?"

1831
01:25:57,390 --> 01:25:58,890
He said he would make kimchi.

1832
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:01,730
Is it Yun Jae?

1833
01:26:04,300 --> 01:26:07,699
(Should I make kimchi for you?)

1834
01:26:08,069 --> 01:26:12,140
"Should I make kimchi for you?" I received a text like this.

1835
01:26:13,940 --> 01:26:15,039
- What? - What?

1836
01:26:15,140 --> 01:26:16,579
- "Should I make kimchi for you?" - "Should I make kimchi for you?"

1837
01:26:16,779 --> 01:26:18,050
He said he would make kimchi.

1838
01:26:18,550 --> 01:26:20,618
Is it Yun Jae?

1839
01:26:20,619 --> 01:26:22,550
- Right. He made kimchi fried rice. - No way.

1840
01:26:23,550 --> 01:26:27,020
(Should I make kimchi for you?)

1841
01:26:27,459 --> 01:26:29,259
When I received the text,

1842
01:26:29,260 --> 01:26:31,930
it didn't sound like Yong Woo at all.

1843
01:26:32,060 --> 01:26:34,900
It felt different from the texts he sent me before.

1844
01:26:36,529 --> 01:26:38,168
It was unexpected.

1845
01:26:38,169 --> 01:26:40,568
"I don't think he would say..."

1846
01:26:40,569 --> 01:26:42,169
"he would make kimchi for me."

1847
01:26:42,999 --> 01:26:46,009
I mostly talked about kimchi...

1848
01:26:46,010 --> 01:26:48,010
with Yun Jae and Ji Won.

1849
01:26:48,610 --> 01:26:51,749
I thought it might be Yun Jae.

1850
01:26:52,850 --> 01:26:55,118
Should I just eat rice and kimchi before I go to bed?

1851
01:26:55,119 --> 01:26:56,279
I'm so hungry.

1852
01:26:57,050 --> 01:26:58,349
Can I eat this kimchi?

1853
01:26:58,350 --> 01:26:59,350
Sure.

1854
01:26:59,789 --> 01:27:03,629
I really wanted to eat uncooked kimchi like this.

1855
01:27:07,529 --> 01:27:09,860
- Is that okay? - It's so good.

1856
01:27:10,300 --> 01:27:11,329
It's a relief.

1857
01:27:15,539 --> 01:27:18,470
(Let's go to the gallery we saw earlier.)

1858
01:27:19,010 --> 01:27:22,840
(It was Yun Ha who received a text from Yun Jae.)

1859
01:27:31,150 --> 01:27:32,989
We couldn't have a proper dinner...

1860
01:27:33,090 --> 01:27:34,890
because we had to go to a hospital.

1861
01:27:35,319 --> 01:27:38,359
We ate in a hurry for 20 or 30 minutes...

1862
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:40,300
in a random restaurant that was open by the street.

1863
01:27:40,999 --> 01:27:42,529
And I was very sorry about it.

1864
01:27:42,730 --> 01:27:45,199
I happened to hear her...

1865
01:27:45,400 --> 01:27:46,899
when she said...

1866
01:27:46,900 --> 01:27:49,270
she wanted to have rice with kimchi.

1867
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:51,668
It's so good.

1868
01:27:51,669 --> 01:27:52,669
Oh, my.

1869
01:27:52,670 --> 01:27:53,909
(Cho A was eating bread)

1870
01:27:54,340 --> 01:27:56,239
- You're hungry, aren't you? - Yes.

1871
01:27:56,409 --> 01:27:57,949
- I want to eat rice with kimchi. - Kimchi?

1872
01:27:59,379 --> 01:28:00,379
Kimchi?

1873
01:28:01,350 --> 01:28:03,150
I wanted to change it up a bit.

1874
01:28:03,449 --> 01:28:05,119
I think she said she wanted to eat kimchi.

1875
01:28:05,989 --> 01:28:07,659
So I texted her like that.

1876
01:28:17,270 --> 01:28:19,299
Did you not ask Cheol Hyeon about who sent the message?

1877
01:28:19,300 --> 01:28:20,840
Oh, right.

1878
01:28:21,039 --> 01:28:23,810
I didn't think of asking him.

1879
01:28:24,140 --> 01:28:28,110
I was thinking about my feelings deeply.

1880
01:28:28,209 --> 01:28:30,449
"Why do I feel this way?"

1881
01:28:30,749 --> 01:28:33,980
"Why did those feelings we had before..."

1882
01:28:34,680 --> 01:28:38,590
"become like this?"

1883
01:28:39,150 --> 01:28:43,059
It was when I started feeling anxious.

1884
01:28:43,060 --> 01:28:44,989
Should I call it gut feelings?

1885
01:28:45,090 --> 01:28:48,560
It felt different from usual.

1886
01:28:52,970 --> 01:28:55,799
Some of his words...

1887
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:57,270
leave an impression.

1888
01:28:57,569 --> 01:28:59,409
While we're on a date,

1889
01:28:59,669 --> 01:29:02,839
he sometimes says impactful things.

1890
01:29:02,840 --> 01:29:05,510
We were waiting in a pharmacy.

1891
01:29:05,610 --> 01:29:07,078
There were many patients.

1892
01:29:07,079 --> 01:29:10,248
So I was just standing...

1893
01:29:10,249 --> 01:29:12,019
by an empty chair...

1894
01:29:12,020 --> 01:29:13,819
so that someone else can sit.

1895
01:29:14,289 --> 01:29:15,590
And Yong Woo...

1896
01:29:16,319 --> 01:29:18,289
(Earlier in a clinic)

1897
01:29:19,260 --> 01:29:20,430
Take a seat over there.

1898
01:29:20,930 --> 01:29:21,930
Okay.

1899
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:25,529
You standing like that while I'm the only one sitting here...

1900
01:29:25,869 --> 01:29:27,470
makes me seem like a bad person.

1901
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:30,369
What he said shocked me.

1902
01:29:30,869 --> 01:29:34,340
"I'm making him seem like a bad person?"

1903
01:29:35,010 --> 01:29:36,480
"Did I really do that?"

1904
01:29:37,779 --> 01:29:40,279
"Why would what I did make him seem that way?"

1905
01:29:40,779 --> 01:29:43,989
I get startled whenever he says something like that.

1906
01:29:44,350 --> 01:29:46,959
"What does he mean by that?"

1907
01:29:47,590 --> 01:29:49,958
"Is it time for me to..."

1908
01:29:49,959 --> 01:29:52,260
"take a step back and think?"

1909
01:29:57,730 --> 01:30:01,970
(Everyone's feelings in Singapore have been sent.)

1910
01:30:02,669 --> 01:30:04,069
She's completely shocked.

1911
01:30:05,169 --> 01:30:08,339
He's gradually realizing that he can't reciprocate...

1912
01:30:08,340 --> 01:30:09,878
- Cho A's feelings, - He's realizing that, yes.

1913
01:30:09,879 --> 01:30:13,550
so he's subconsciously sorry.

1914
01:30:13,749 --> 01:30:15,749
But Cho A keeps treating him nicely,

1915
01:30:16,550 --> 01:30:18,818
so I think that's why he just blurted that out.

1916
01:30:18,819 --> 01:30:20,889
- Right. - The situation's all twisted.

1917
01:30:20,890 --> 01:30:22,418
Or it could be this.

1918
01:30:22,419 --> 01:30:25,190
They've been having heavy conversations up until now.

1919
01:30:25,730 --> 01:30:28,360
So he wanted to do something fun to make up for it.

1920
01:30:28,999 --> 01:30:31,368
- But he thinks he ruined it, - It didn't work out that way.

1921
01:30:31,369 --> 01:30:33,129
so he feels like he's a bad person.

1922
01:30:33,230 --> 01:30:35,168
If there was nothing wrong between them,

1923
01:30:35,169 --> 01:30:37,109
they would have gotten over the situation like it was nothing.

1924
01:30:37,110 --> 01:30:38,110
- That's right. - Right.

1925
01:30:38,111 --> 01:30:39,908
That situation itself isn't the problem.

1926
01:30:39,909 --> 01:30:41,708
But because their feelings have changed,

1927
01:30:41,709 --> 01:30:42,980
that situation became a problem.

1928
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:02,829
That's...

1929
01:31:03,930 --> 01:31:04,969
"The final selection day..."

1930
01:31:04,970 --> 01:31:08,440
- "is in 4 days." - Is in 4 days.

1931
01:31:10,169 --> 01:31:11,809
"To make your decision without any regrets,"

1932
01:31:11,810 --> 01:31:14,479
"you'll be going on a date with someone..."

1933
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:16,310
"you haven't been on a date so far."

1934
01:31:16,409 --> 01:31:18,248
"You can choose your date in the order of those..."

1935
01:31:18,249 --> 01:31:22,150
"with the most number of people they haven't been on a date with."

1936
01:31:22,419 --> 01:31:24,590
"Yun Jae, go up to the patio right now..."

1937
01:31:24,789 --> 01:31:26,819
"and answer the phone when it rings."

1938
01:31:27,659 --> 01:31:28,690
I knew this was coming.

1939
01:31:30,190 --> 01:31:32,629
This could cause some confusion.

1940
01:31:33,190 --> 01:31:36,529
The first thought I had was, "Who didn't I go on a date with?"

1941
01:31:36,760 --> 01:31:38,329
Because recently,

1942
01:31:38,629 --> 01:31:40,940
I've only been on dates with the same person.

1943
01:31:41,140 --> 01:31:44,368
I thought I would keep going out on dates with only Yong Woo...

1944
01:31:44,369 --> 01:31:46,640
unless I was forced to go out with someone else.

1945
01:31:46,739 --> 01:31:50,379
So on the one hand, I was glad to be in this new situation.

1946
01:31:50,749 --> 01:31:54,650
I would have two options.

1947
01:31:54,749 --> 01:31:57,118
Ji Won and Ju Yeon.

1948
01:31:57,119 --> 01:31:58,890
I wanted to go on a date with Ji Won.

1949
01:31:59,489 --> 01:32:00,860
Ju Yeon is tall.

1950
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:05,528
I didn't think a lot would change.

1951
01:32:05,529 --> 01:32:07,129
All right. This isn't bad.

1952
01:32:08,260 --> 01:32:11,729
I was disappointed that we were given this opportunity in Singapore.

1953
01:32:11,730 --> 01:32:15,400
I wanted to choose someone I'd already been on a date with.

1954
01:32:15,499 --> 01:32:16,770
"Answer the phone when it rings."

1955
01:32:16,869 --> 01:32:18,169
- The patio on the fourth floor. - I see.

1956
01:32:21,039 --> 01:32:22,209
Yun Jae, be careful.

1957
01:32:25,409 --> 01:32:28,479
I'm the only person Yun Jae has been on a date with,

1958
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:29,850
so he was the first one to go.

1959
01:32:30,050 --> 01:32:32,150
I feel like he would have chosen Se Seung.

1960
01:32:32,789 --> 01:32:35,519
My remaining options were...

1961
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:36,959
Yun Jae and Cheol Hyeon.

1962
01:32:37,329 --> 01:32:39,789
Honestly, I wasn't interested.

1963
01:32:41,329 --> 01:32:42,430
(Sighing)

1964
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:46,430
There's really no one.

1965
01:32:48,270 --> 01:32:49,970
This is a problem.

1966
01:32:57,980 --> 01:32:59,180
(Sighing)

1967
01:33:03,619 --> 01:33:05,289
There's no one I want to choose.

1968
01:33:05,919 --> 01:33:07,690
There's no one I want to choose.

1969
01:33:08,720 --> 01:33:09,789
There's no one I want to choose.

1970
01:33:09,890 --> 01:33:12,789
Why would this happen to me? I was so happy today.

1971
01:33:13,289 --> 01:33:16,129
I felt light-headed and felt like I could lose my mind.

1972
01:33:16,329 --> 01:33:19,629
There's no one I want to choose. What should I do?

1973
01:33:21,069 --> 01:33:22,400
There's no one I want to choose.

1974
01:33:24,909 --> 01:33:25,970
There's no one I want to choose.

1975
01:33:26,669 --> 01:33:27,879
It must be really confusing for him.

1976
01:33:28,340 --> 01:33:31,749
If he really likes Yun Ha that much,

1977
01:33:31,850 --> 01:33:33,408
- he should choose... - Someone totally random.

1978
01:33:33,409 --> 01:33:35,578
someone Yun Ha wouldn't be worried about...

1979
01:33:35,579 --> 01:33:36,949
- at all. - Right.

1980
01:33:37,919 --> 01:33:38,919
Who would that be?

1981
01:33:39,720 --> 01:33:41,390
Who's next aside from Yun Jae?

1982
01:33:41,819 --> 01:33:43,489
- Who's next? - It's all similar for us.

1983
01:33:43,890 --> 01:33:44,890
I...

1984
01:33:46,159 --> 01:33:47,159
I have six options.

1985
01:33:47,900 --> 01:33:49,599
- Or is it five? - Did you include the men too?

1986
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:50,600
Yes.

1987
01:33:52,970 --> 01:33:54,770
- What? - What are you doing?

1988
01:33:57,470 --> 01:33:58,770
Is the call taking long?

1989
01:33:59,709 --> 01:34:02,239
(Yun Jae is still thinking.)

1990
01:34:03,980 --> 01:34:04,980
Okay.

1991
01:34:06,779 --> 01:34:08,449
(The call has to come through.)

1992
01:34:10,789 --> 01:34:12,919
(The phone finally rings.)

1993
01:34:16,319 --> 01:34:17,329
Hello?

1994
01:34:19,060 --> 01:34:21,528
Yun Jae. You haven’t been on a date with...

1995
01:34:21,529 --> 01:34:22,958
three female participants.

1996
01:34:22,959 --> 01:34:25,499
You will choose one of them and go on a date with her tomorrow.

1997
01:34:25,930 --> 01:34:27,640
Listen to their numbers and choose.

1998
01:34:28,069 --> 01:34:29,100
Number one, Ju Yeon.

1999
01:34:30,739 --> 01:34:31,770
Number two, Se Seung.

2000
01:34:32,869 --> 01:34:33,909
Number three, Cho A.

2001
01:34:35,510 --> 01:34:36,510
Ju Yeon.

2002
01:34:37,909 --> 01:34:38,949
Number one, Ju Yeon.

2003
01:34:39,909 --> 01:34:42,449
(Yun Jae chose Ju Yeon.)

2004
01:34:43,319 --> 01:34:45,619
Why did you choose number one?

2005
01:34:46,319 --> 01:34:47,720
I haven't talked with her much.

2006
01:34:48,690 --> 01:34:51,760
Yun Jae and Ju Yeon will be going on a date.

2007
01:34:52,289 --> 01:34:53,730
I chose Ju Yeon.

2008
01:34:54,430 --> 01:34:56,999
I felt like she was the person I was least close with.

2009
01:34:57,369 --> 01:34:58,668
I don't think it'll be awkward...

2010
01:34:58,669 --> 01:35:01,068
because my decision itself...

2011
01:35:01,069 --> 01:35:03,340
wasn't about going on a date.

2012
01:35:04,539 --> 01:35:06,669
"What should I talk about with someone who is younger than me,"

2013
01:35:06,770 --> 01:35:07,779
was my thought.

2014
01:35:08,980 --> 01:35:10,479
Hey, Yun Jae.

2015
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:12,809
- He's coming down the stairs. - Seeing you like that...

2016
01:35:12,810 --> 01:35:13,810
reminds me of when we first met you.

2017
01:35:13,850 --> 01:35:16,419
- Gosh. - What's wrong with you?

2018
01:35:17,050 --> 01:35:19,119
- This is the moment - That's so funny.

2019
01:35:19,590 --> 01:35:21,560
No, you look great coming down the stairs.

2020
01:35:22,119 --> 01:35:23,288
Who's next?

2021
01:35:23,289 --> 01:35:26,659
There wasn't any instruction about who's next.

2022
01:35:27,029 --> 01:35:28,400
There wasn't any instruction about who's next?

2023
01:35:28,499 --> 01:35:30,199
There must be people who have the same number of options.

2024
01:35:30,869 --> 01:35:31,970
(The bell rings.)

2025
01:35:32,169 --> 01:35:33,569
- What is that? - It's here.

2026
01:35:33,940 --> 01:35:34,940
No way.

2027
01:35:34,999 --> 01:35:36,038
I guess it's over.

2028
01:35:36,039 --> 01:35:38,009
- It must be over, then. - Everyone must be matched already.

2029
01:35:38,010 --> 01:35:41,908
Right. Once everyone with one option left is matched,

2030
01:35:41,909 --> 01:35:43,879
the rest have limited options.

2031
01:35:44,110 --> 01:35:45,149
- Yes. - That's right.

2032
01:35:45,150 --> 01:35:46,550
All right. We got this.

2033
01:35:47,850 --> 01:35:49,480
It's been a while since Cheol Hyeon read it.

2034
01:35:50,919 --> 01:35:53,318
"These are the finalized couples."

2035
01:35:53,319 --> 01:35:54,520
Ju Yeon and Yun Jae.

2036
01:35:56,119 --> 01:35:57,158
I didn't expect it.

2037
01:35:57,159 --> 01:36:00,599
Maybe he wanted to use the opportunity to get to know me?

2038
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:02,129
It was very unexpected.

2039
01:36:02,329 --> 01:36:05,569
I wondered why he chose her.

2040
01:36:05,669 --> 01:36:06,699
Ji Won and Jung Sub.

2041
01:36:08,069 --> 01:36:09,669
To make my decision without any regrets,

2042
01:36:09,770 --> 01:36:13,739
I thought I should go on a date with Ji Won too.

2043
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:16,078
First of all, I was so disappointed.

2044
01:36:16,079 --> 01:36:18,849
I had hoped to have more time...

2045
01:36:18,850 --> 01:36:21,650
to get to know Jae Hyung better.

2046
01:36:21,980 --> 01:36:23,150
I wasn't worried.

2047
01:36:23,779 --> 01:36:26,350
I'm not really sure what will happen...

2048
01:36:26,550 --> 01:36:27,959
with Ji Won's feelings.

2049
01:36:27,989 --> 01:36:29,060
Cho A and Jae Hyung.

2050
01:36:30,789 --> 01:36:32,860
I think I would have chosen Yun Jae.

2051
01:36:33,390 --> 01:36:36,599
Cho A was the only available option for me.

2052
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:40,969
I was just very disappointed overall about...

2053
01:36:40,970 --> 01:36:43,369
not being able to go out on a date with Ji Won,

2054
01:36:43,569 --> 01:36:46,209
so I didn't have any other thoughts.

2055
01:36:46,510 --> 01:36:47,510
Se Seung and Cheol Hyeon.

2056
01:36:48,180 --> 01:36:51,680
I'm really happy about it. Cheol Hyeon and I get along well.

2057
01:36:51,779 --> 01:36:54,720
I noticed that Cheol Hyeon hasn't been out on dates a lot,

2058
01:36:54,919 --> 01:36:56,850
so I did want to get him out of the house.

2059
01:36:56,949 --> 01:36:58,150
I thought it was good that we matched.

2060
01:36:58,550 --> 01:37:01,459
I was a bit disappointed after seeing the list.

2061
01:37:01,560 --> 01:37:03,390
It's not that I didn't like Se Seung.

2062
01:37:03,819 --> 01:37:06,059
I didn't match with the person who I had in mind,

2063
01:37:06,060 --> 01:37:08,529
so I guess I was disappointed.

2064
01:37:08,730 --> 01:37:09,959
Yun Ha and Yong Woo.

2065
01:37:10,970 --> 01:37:13,969
I think I felt comfortable...

2066
01:37:13,970 --> 01:37:15,169
that my date was Yun Ha.

2067
01:37:15,270 --> 01:37:18,168
And I think I hoped that...

2068
01:37:18,169 --> 01:37:20,169
the frustration I felt would clear up.

2069
01:37:21,010 --> 01:37:25,150
I was worried about Yong Woo and Yun Ha.

2070
01:37:25,850 --> 01:37:28,649
We were once on the road together,

2071
01:37:28,650 --> 01:37:31,349
and I think it was Yun Ha...

2072
01:37:31,350 --> 01:37:33,350
who led the bright atmosphere.

2073
01:37:33,449 --> 01:37:37,118
Yong Woo likes being in a fun atmosphere,

2074
01:37:37,119 --> 01:37:40,799
so I was slightly anxious that he would...

2075
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:42,029
have more fun with her.

2076
01:37:43,260 --> 01:37:44,299
It's really...

2077
01:37:44,300 --> 01:37:45,899
"Due to the first decision made by Yun Jae,"

2078
01:37:45,900 --> 01:37:47,940
"the rest of you were automatically matched as couples."

2079
01:37:56,940 --> 01:37:58,550
(There's another letter behind it.)

2080
01:38:01,249 --> 01:38:03,378
"Tomorrow's date will be proceeded..."

2081
01:38:03,379 --> 01:38:05,050
"in separate levels of 1,000 dollars,"

2082
01:38:05,650 --> 01:38:08,590
"500 dollars, 300 dollars, 100 dollars, and 50 dollars."

2083
01:38:08,860 --> 01:38:09,889
- What? - A 1,000 dollars?

2084
01:38:09,890 --> 01:38:11,889
Why is this suddenly turning into "Happiness With Ten Dollars?

2085
01:38:11,890 --> 01:38:15,028
"Tomorrow, at 11am, you'll determine the date budget ranking..."

2086
01:38:15,029 --> 01:38:17,868
"through holding the first Women's Chicken Fight Competition."

2087
01:38:17,869 --> 01:38:20,529
- Chicken fight? - Women's Chicken Fight Competition.

2088
01:38:20,840 --> 01:38:22,239
How do you play a chicken fight?

2089
01:38:24,610 --> 01:38:26,010
Chicken fight.

2090
01:38:27,069 --> 01:38:28,709
I'm not confident when it comes to chicken fight.

2091
01:38:28,810 --> 01:38:30,879
I'm at such a disadvantage.

2092
01:38:30,980 --> 01:38:32,409
I'll probably come in fifth.

2093
01:38:35,650 --> 01:38:37,789
(I'll probably come in 5th.)

2094
01:38:38,819 --> 01:38:41,090
(The uprising of the 5th-place prospect)

2095
01:38:41,860 --> 01:38:42,860
- Out of the blue. - Gosh.

2096
01:38:43,319 --> 01:38:44,730
- What's going on? - Gosh.

2097
01:38:44,930 --> 01:38:46,459
(She has good core strength.)

2098
01:38:48,260 --> 01:38:50,599
(She's really scary. I'm so scared.)

2099
01:38:50,600 --> 01:38:51,970
(Why are you so high up?)

2100
01:38:52,730 --> 01:38:53,829
(Let's get this over with.)

2101
01:38:55,699 --> 01:38:57,270
(That ferocity was beyond lunacy...)

2102
01:39:00,169 --> 01:39:02,509
There was a reason why we watched the chicken fight today.

2103
01:39:02,510 --> 01:39:03,539
Gosh, you're right.

2104
01:39:05,050 --> 01:39:06,610
(It was a forewarning of the chicken fight competition.)

2105
01:39:07,150 --> 01:39:08,680
- They foreshadowed it. - Right.

2106
01:39:09,249 --> 01:39:10,448
This is going to be fun.

2107
01:39:10,449 --> 01:39:11,948
The women will be playing, not the men.

2108
01:39:11,949 --> 01:39:13,519
Maybe the chickens earlier were the foreshadowing.

2109
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:15,159
- Right. It was the foreshadowing. - Right?

2110
01:39:16,419 --> 01:39:17,988
Isn't Ju Yeon way superior?

2111
01:39:17,989 --> 01:39:20,628
- Ju Yeon. Yes. - Like she's on a different height.

2112
01:39:20,629 --> 01:39:22,159
- She could just push them down. - Right.

2113
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:24,369
When you're tall, you're good at chicken fights.

2114
01:39:24,829 --> 01:39:26,769
Come up with a strategy to win with your date...

2115
01:39:26,770 --> 01:39:28,270
before the competition is held.

2116
01:39:28,499 --> 01:39:30,940
So Ji Won, what you should do is...

2117
01:39:32,840 --> 01:39:34,039
You have to do good.

2118
01:39:34,140 --> 01:39:36,839
Why? Jung Sub, we could have fun with just 50 dollars.

2119
01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:37,948
I'm fully capable of that too.

2120
01:39:37,949 --> 01:39:40,309
But the prices in Singapore...

2121
01:39:40,310 --> 01:39:42,619
is 10 to 15 percent higher than the prices in Korea.

2122
01:39:42,980 --> 01:39:46,289
I was aiming for 2nd place, 500 dollars.

2123
01:39:46,390 --> 01:39:48,418
I should at least be in third place.

2124
01:39:48,419 --> 01:39:50,288
I can't receive 100 dollars or 50 dollars.

2125
01:39:50,289 --> 01:39:51,860
Singapore prices are expensive.

2126
01:39:53,190 --> 01:39:55,698
Isn't 50 dollars too harsh?

2127
01:39:55,699 --> 01:39:56,730
Chicken fight?

2128
01:39:56,959 --> 01:39:59,069
I just have to beat Yun Ha, right?

2129
01:39:59,400 --> 01:40:00,940
I'll win 100 dollars if I beat Yun Ha?

2130
01:40:01,340 --> 01:40:03,069
- Cho A, let's go for 1,000 dollars. - Let's go.

2131
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:07,208
Marina Bay Sands... I feel like we could win 1,000 dollars.

2132
01:40:07,209 --> 01:40:09,039
- You think so? - I suddenly feel like we can.

2133
01:40:10,480 --> 01:40:13,448
I hope Jae Hyung doesn't win...

2134
01:40:13,449 --> 01:40:15,118
a date that is too luxurious.

2135
01:40:15,119 --> 01:40:16,579
Going on a luxurious date...

2136
01:40:16,779 --> 01:40:19,689
feels like he'll return home late.

2137
01:40:19,690 --> 01:40:22,019
The atmosphere will create...

2138
01:40:22,020 --> 01:40:24,429
a good memory for him,

2139
01:40:24,430 --> 01:40:26,989
so I hope he doesn't win either 1st or 2nd place.

2140
01:40:27,190 --> 01:40:30,559
If I'm right-handed, I should stand on my right foot, right?

2141
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:32,100
You should stand on the foot you feel comfortable with.

2142
01:40:32,699 --> 01:40:34,939
- People usually... Try that. - That's good.

2143
01:40:34,940 --> 01:40:36,498
- You'll feel comfortable. - My right foot it is.

2144
01:40:36,499 --> 01:40:37,669
You're doing good.

2145
01:40:38,209 --> 01:40:39,770
Right. It's possible to move around.

2146
01:40:40,110 --> 01:40:41,708
I feel like she'll be the best one.

2147
01:40:41,709 --> 01:40:43,208
I'm going to do my best.

2148
01:40:43,209 --> 01:40:45,649
If you're going to be doing it anyway...

2149
01:40:45,650 --> 01:40:47,049
- I should do my best. - You should do your best.

2150
01:40:47,050 --> 01:40:49,050
Move this table slightly back and...

2151
01:40:49,319 --> 01:40:52,050
We'll see your posture. How your posture is.

2152
01:40:52,289 --> 01:40:53,850
- You shouldn't fall like this. - Gosh.

2153
01:40:54,760 --> 01:40:56,760
- Is he a chicken? - His leg...

2154
01:40:56,819 --> 01:40:58,260
Tomorrow, everyone's going to be...

2155
01:40:58,329 --> 01:41:00,659
(They're all going to be burning with passion.)

2156
01:41:01,100 --> 01:41:02,559
"You got this. You got this."

2157
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:03,698
While slapping their faces.

2158
01:41:03,699 --> 01:41:06,770
"You're doing great. Just keep going."

2159
01:41:09,569 --> 01:41:11,039
So do we start practising now?

2160
01:41:11,270 --> 01:41:12,640
Let's hurry up and go practice.

2161
01:41:13,039 --> 01:41:14,340
I'll go get changed.

2162
01:41:14,909 --> 01:41:15,909
Goodnight.

2163
01:41:17,110 --> 01:41:18,110
I'm going to shower.

2164
01:41:19,150 --> 01:41:20,980
You have a five o'clock shadow.

2165
01:41:21,180 --> 01:41:22,520
- What? - Nothing.

2166
01:41:23,819 --> 01:41:24,919
Ji Won.

2167
01:41:25,150 --> 01:41:26,190
- Yes. - Do you want to have a drink?

2168
01:41:26,289 --> 01:41:27,760
Sure. Okay.

2169
01:41:28,360 --> 01:41:29,590
(Glancing at her)

2170
01:41:32,029 --> 01:41:33,029
What?

2171
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:35,829
- Are you hungry? - Hungry?

2172
01:41:36,199 --> 01:41:38,169
I should lock our room, so she can't come inside.

2173
01:41:38,400 --> 01:41:40,568
You can hear the crickets. It's nice.

2174
01:41:40,569 --> 01:41:42,868
It is. You've created your own hideout here.

2175
01:41:42,869 --> 01:41:43,939
Yes, I did.

2176
01:41:43,940 --> 01:41:45,708
This is nice.

2177
01:41:45,709 --> 01:41:48,939
- Did you have fun today? - Yes. We did a lot of things today.

2178
01:41:48,940 --> 01:41:52,948
And this was my first time talking to Jae Hyung,

2179
01:41:52,949 --> 01:41:54,149
so it was fun.

2180
01:41:54,150 --> 01:41:55,249
- You had fun? - Yes.

2181
01:41:57,279 --> 01:42:01,260
Anyway, I've been thinking that I want to talk to you, Ji Won.

2182
01:42:01,819 --> 01:42:03,859
- When we chose our dates yesterday, - Yes.

2183
01:42:03,860 --> 01:42:07,429
I was hoping that you would choose me.

2184
01:42:07,430 --> 01:42:11,270
When you first got here,

2185
01:42:11,770 --> 01:42:14,368
I thought you were nice, and I was curious about you.

2186
01:42:14,369 --> 01:42:18,069
I also felt like you and I were similar people.

2187
01:42:18,209 --> 01:42:20,940
But, right now, I kind of feel like...

2188
01:42:21,680 --> 01:42:25,408
someone who makes me more cheerful,

2189
01:42:25,409 --> 01:42:27,618
someone who is cute with a bright energy,

2190
01:42:27,619 --> 01:42:30,720
is the kind of person I want to be with.

2191
01:42:30,879 --> 01:42:31,889
I see.

2192
01:42:31,890 --> 01:42:34,759
And I feel like Jae Hyung has...

2193
01:42:34,760 --> 01:42:36,158
some of those qualities.

2194
01:42:36,159 --> 01:42:38,959
- I see. - Yes.

2195
01:42:39,629 --> 01:42:42,799
When I came here, I didn't want to leave with regrets.

2196
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:44,999
And I want to go out on a date with you.

2197
01:42:46,069 --> 01:42:49,039
Right. I was working at the time,

2198
01:42:49,199 --> 01:42:51,840
so you didn't get to go out on a date like the others.

2199
01:42:53,039 --> 01:42:54,309
When I talk with you,

2200
01:42:54,310 --> 01:42:56,738
I feel like I'll be able to reach...

2201
01:42:56,739 --> 01:43:00,479
the deepest parts of myself...

2202
01:43:00,480 --> 01:43:02,149
that I'm aware of.

2203
01:43:02,150 --> 01:43:03,818
- Yourself? - Yes.

2204
01:43:03,819 --> 01:43:07,418
There's so much time that I've spent thinking...

2205
01:43:07,419 --> 01:43:10,318
while being isolated inside those parts.

2206
01:43:10,319 --> 01:43:12,689
Someone who is a bit different from me,

2207
01:43:12,690 --> 01:43:14,860
who can get me out of that space,

2208
01:43:16,029 --> 01:43:18,698
is who I feel like I want to be with.

2209
01:43:18,699 --> 01:43:19,730
I see.

2210
01:43:19,829 --> 01:43:21,269
I know that it's a great thing...

2211
01:43:21,270 --> 01:43:23,038
to be able to talk to someone...

2212
01:43:23,039 --> 01:43:25,440
and connect with them through shared feelings.

2213
01:43:25,940 --> 01:43:28,909
But I'm at a period in my life...

2214
01:43:29,209 --> 01:43:30,578
where I want to step out of that.

2215
01:43:30,579 --> 01:43:32,248
I think I understand what you're saying...

2216
01:43:32,249 --> 01:43:34,578
because I also have that tendency too.

2217
01:43:34,579 --> 01:43:36,720
I feel like you must have had a moment like that too.

2218
01:43:37,020 --> 01:43:39,850
- I feel like we're similar. - Right.

2219
01:43:40,020 --> 01:43:41,060
Right.

2220
01:43:41,459 --> 01:43:42,590
Anyway, that's it.

2221
01:43:45,959 --> 01:43:47,929
(Jae Hyung is visiting Jung Sub's room.)

2222
01:43:47,930 --> 01:43:48,930
Come in.

2223
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:51,569
- Gosh. - What?

2224
01:43:52,230 --> 01:43:53,499
Your room is awesome.

2225
01:43:54,869 --> 01:43:55,998
You should sleep over sometime.

2226
01:43:55,999 --> 01:43:57,139
(He turns around immediately.)

2227
01:43:57,140 --> 01:43:59,310
Isn't your bed huge?

2228
01:44:00,069 --> 01:44:01,738
- Let's... - Shall we lay down?

2229
01:44:01,739 --> 01:44:04,479
(Let's be sprawled out.)

2230
01:44:04,480 --> 01:44:06,509
- Gosh, this is nice. - This is nice.

2231
01:44:06,510 --> 01:44:08,379
- Right. - Who's your date tomorrow?

2232
01:44:08,579 --> 01:44:10,549
I have a date with Ji Won tomorrow.

2233
01:44:10,550 --> 01:44:11,619
(I see.)

2234
01:44:12,119 --> 01:44:13,689
You haven't been on a date with Ji Won before.

2235
01:44:13,690 --> 01:44:15,360
No. Not once.

2236
01:44:17,319 --> 01:44:19,989
(He peers into Ji Won's room.)

2237
01:44:22,760 --> 01:44:25,800
(He runs into Yun Jae who was in the Kitchen.)

2238
01:44:26,230 --> 01:44:27,999
- Did you have fun today? - Yes.

2239
01:44:28,400 --> 01:44:30,168
It was my first date with Ji Won.

2240
01:44:30,169 --> 01:44:32,569
- Really? It was your first time? - Yes.

2241
01:44:32,709 --> 01:44:35,239
I think it was the first time we had an actual conversation too.

2242
01:44:35,680 --> 01:44:36,779
But then,

2243
01:44:37,239 --> 01:44:40,510
we were together all throughout the day today,

2244
01:44:40,579 --> 01:44:41,779
so I feel like we talked a lot...

2245
01:44:42,119 --> 01:44:44,690
all at once that it was very impactful.

2246
01:44:45,119 --> 01:44:46,248
I just hope my sister...

2247
01:44:46,249 --> 01:44:48,190
doesn't put you through any trouble.

2248
01:44:48,659 --> 01:44:51,989
Why? Ji Won is so nice.

2249
01:44:52,360 --> 01:44:54,560
Everyone is nice to other people.

2250
01:44:55,300 --> 01:44:56,900
- She's not nice to you? - That's correct.

2251
01:44:56,930 --> 01:44:58,329
(Laughing)

2252
01:44:58,400 --> 01:45:01,999
Did you want to go out with someone you haven't been on a date with?

2253
01:45:02,440 --> 01:45:05,239
Or would you have rather chosen your date, yourself?

2254
01:45:05,640 --> 01:45:06,909
I just wanted to choose.

2255
01:45:07,539 --> 01:45:09,180
- What about you? - Me?

2256
01:45:09,739 --> 01:45:12,510
I just want to choose at this point.

2257
01:45:12,879 --> 01:45:15,278
I usually don't contemplate about things.

2258
01:45:15,279 --> 01:45:16,480
I realized we don't have a lot of time left.

2259
01:45:17,150 --> 01:45:18,219
- That's right. - Yes.

2260
01:45:18,220 --> 01:45:20,619
But I'm the type who contemplates a lot,

2261
01:45:20,949 --> 01:45:22,919
- and I'm very cautious. - I see.

2262
01:45:23,119 --> 01:45:26,829
So, for me, having so little time is...

2263
01:45:27,829 --> 01:45:30,060
- I should head upstairs and sleep. - Just go to sleep.

2264
01:45:32,029 --> 01:45:33,029
(Glancing)

2265
01:45:35,699 --> 01:45:37,539
Practice is the only way.

2266
01:45:37,970 --> 01:45:39,010
Practice is the only way.

2267
01:45:39,409 --> 01:45:41,140
(Pushing down)

2268
01:45:42,610 --> 01:45:44,340
(Pushing up)

2269
01:45:44,409 --> 01:45:46,310
Practice is the only way.

2270
01:45:48,579 --> 01:45:49,779
This is so hard.

2271
01:45:50,379 --> 01:45:51,489
Let's just go to sleep.

2272
01:45:52,789 --> 01:45:56,390
(She tries to ease the bloating from her legs for tomorrow.)

2273
01:45:56,989 --> 01:45:59,190
(Yong Woo and Ju Yeon's room)

2274
01:45:59,459 --> 01:46:01,230
How was your day at home?

2275
01:46:02,159 --> 01:46:04,800
Cheol Hyeon and I had a good time today.

2276
01:46:05,629 --> 01:46:08,840
I got to find out about who Cheol Hyeon has feelings for too.

2277
01:46:09,300 --> 01:46:12,909
I'm no longer emotionally affected by every single thing.

2278
01:46:13,869 --> 01:46:15,079
That's great.

2279
01:46:15,640 --> 01:46:18,650
However, could you give me a tip...

2280
01:46:19,180 --> 01:46:20,810
about my current situation?

2281
01:46:21,919 --> 01:46:25,050
(Pondering)

2282
01:46:27,390 --> 01:46:29,520
In your situation, your arrow is pointed at...

2283
01:46:30,159 --> 01:46:31,759
Jae Hyung, right?

2284
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:33,489
And Jae Hyung's arrow is...

2285
01:46:34,860 --> 01:46:35,959
I think it's pointed at Ji Won.

2286
01:46:37,060 --> 01:46:39,499
- Ji Won is popular. - Yes.

2287
01:46:40,529 --> 01:46:41,940
Ji Won is pretty.

2288
01:46:43,169 --> 01:46:44,400
Ji Won is fun.

2289
01:46:44,840 --> 01:46:46,409
Yes. Ji Won is pretty and fun.

2290
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:51,010
Right.

2291
01:46:52,110 --> 01:46:55,849
Ji Won seems like the type to get along with anyone.

2292
01:46:55,850 --> 01:46:58,689
That's right. She's the only one who I've been on a one-on-one date with,

2293
01:46:58,690 --> 01:47:01,019
and who I saw go out on a date with other people.

2294
01:47:01,020 --> 01:47:02,090
Yes.

2295
01:47:02,489 --> 01:47:04,259
I don't know what will happen either.

2296
01:47:04,260 --> 01:47:05,529
We still have four days left.

2297
01:47:05,730 --> 01:47:08,159
(He's not being a helpful older brother.)

2298
01:47:08,900 --> 01:47:11,899
- I think I'm doing what's best. - Yes.

2299
01:47:11,900 --> 01:47:13,699
Anything is possible.

2300
01:47:13,930 --> 01:47:15,300
We don't know what could happen.

2301
01:47:16,400 --> 01:47:19,039
(Yun Ha and Jung Sub's room)

2302
01:47:19,340 --> 01:47:21,310
Go for the 1,000 dollars...

2303
01:47:21,409 --> 01:47:22,879
with Ji Won tomorrow.

2304
01:47:24,140 --> 01:47:26,378
I think Ji Won is going to win the 1,000 dollars.

2305
01:47:26,379 --> 01:47:27,578
I hope she wins.

2306
01:47:27,579 --> 01:47:29,020
I like Ji Won.

2307
01:47:29,350 --> 01:47:30,419
Me too.

2308
01:47:30,550 --> 01:47:33,618
I like everyone, but...

2309
01:47:33,619 --> 01:47:34,989
You could be right for each other.

2310
01:47:35,590 --> 01:47:37,590
- That's true. - She's very easy-going.

2311
01:47:37,659 --> 01:47:38,659
Right.

2312
01:47:39,430 --> 01:47:42,399
But Yun Jae told me...

2313
01:47:42,400 --> 01:47:46,470
that Ji Won usually goes for guys like Jae Hyung.

2314
01:47:46,629 --> 01:47:49,339
- Really? - She likes the pretty boy type.

2315
01:47:49,340 --> 01:47:50,940
I see.

2316
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:53,239
Then I'm ruined.

2317
01:47:58,079 --> 01:47:59,110
But the thing is,

2318
01:47:59,379 --> 01:48:01,150
Se Seung...

2319
01:48:02,150 --> 01:48:03,680
just looks at me.

2320
01:48:05,720 --> 01:48:06,949
She looks at me like this.

2321
01:48:07,150 --> 01:48:10,288
So I told her that, "Se Seung, I don't know what to do..."

2322
01:48:10,289 --> 01:48:11,329
"when you look at me."

2323
01:48:11,860 --> 01:48:13,190
She said she was just looking at me.

2324
01:48:14,900 --> 01:48:16,199
It's because you're good-looking.

2325
01:48:16,459 --> 01:48:17,560
No, it's not.

2326
01:48:18,699 --> 01:48:20,169
It's because you're good-looking.

2327
01:48:20,329 --> 01:48:22,569
It is. Girls can be like that. I'm like that too.

2328
01:48:22,669 --> 01:48:25,440
When the guy is too good-looking, I just end up...

2329
01:48:25,770 --> 01:48:27,069
looking at him. I just stare.

2330
01:48:27,209 --> 01:48:29,738
- You just stare at him like this? - Yes. That's what happens.

2331
01:48:29,739 --> 01:48:31,579
You know how Se Seung's eyes are too clear, they feel intense.

2332
01:48:34,550 --> 01:48:37,318
- She looks at me like this. - I see what you mean.

2333
01:48:37,319 --> 01:48:38,390
Right?

2334
01:48:41,020 --> 01:48:42,819
Should I talk to Se Seung again?

2335
01:48:44,289 --> 01:48:46,459
(Yun Jae and Ji Won's room)

2336
01:48:46,829 --> 01:48:49,629
- So? Did you have fun today? - What?

2337
01:48:49,760 --> 01:48:51,029
- Did you have fun? - I did have fun.

2338
01:48:51,060 --> 01:48:52,628
It seems like Jae Hyung had fun too.

2339
01:48:52,629 --> 01:48:54,629
- He and I talked for a bit earlier. - What did he say?

2340
01:48:55,300 --> 01:48:57,470
- He said he had fun. - I think we get along.

2341
01:48:57,840 --> 01:48:59,908
The thing is that... You see me as a coward,

2342
01:48:59,909 --> 01:49:02,139
but you know I actually just do whatever I want.

2343
01:49:02,140 --> 01:49:03,908
- But Jae Hyung isn't like that. - I see.

2344
01:49:03,909 --> 01:49:06,049
- He's not someone who's brave. - I see.

2345
01:49:06,050 --> 01:49:08,219
I think he's more cautious...

2346
01:49:08,220 --> 01:49:10,180
- than I thought, like you said. - Yes.

2347
01:49:11,150 --> 01:49:13,389
But I think he could be cautious...

2348
01:49:13,390 --> 01:49:15,760
because he's not brave, like I just said.

2349
01:49:16,360 --> 01:49:18,959
Jae Hyung came over to me, all of a sudden, and asked me a question.

2350
01:49:18,989 --> 01:49:20,759
The fact that he never came to me about something like that before,

2351
01:49:20,760 --> 01:49:22,060
but he suddenly did means...

2352
01:49:22,459 --> 01:49:23,559
What did he ask?

2353
01:49:23,560 --> 01:49:26,429
Would you choose someone you want to go on a date with...

2354
01:49:26,430 --> 01:49:29,269
or would you rather choose to go on dates with different people?

2355
01:49:29,270 --> 01:49:32,738
So I told him I only have eyes for one person.

2356
01:49:32,739 --> 01:49:33,908
But Jae Hyung said that...

2357
01:49:33,909 --> 01:49:37,509
he contemplates a lot when he has to decide on something like this.

2358
01:49:37,510 --> 01:49:38,979
He must have had you on his mind.

2359
01:49:38,980 --> 01:49:41,448
Whether it's because you and Cheol Hyeon were talking alone,

2360
01:49:41,449 --> 01:49:44,050
he would have brought it up because you were on his mind.

2361
01:49:44,220 --> 01:49:46,948
Do you think me talking with Cheol Hyeon earlier...

2362
01:49:46,949 --> 01:49:49,889
could have seemed like that to Jae Hyung?

2363
01:49:49,890 --> 01:49:51,318
It could have because...

2364
01:49:51,319 --> 01:49:54,128
- he... - But Cheol Hyeon came over to me.

2365
01:49:54,129 --> 01:49:56,829
Right. But from the perspective of someone who doesn't know that...

2366
01:49:57,129 --> 01:49:59,299
Just like you don't know how Jae Hyung feels.

2367
01:49:59,300 --> 01:50:00,699
Jae Hyung wouldn't know how you feel.

2368
01:50:01,129 --> 01:50:03,199
If you think of it like that...

2369
01:50:03,440 --> 01:50:06,568
Jae Hyung might not be sure about how I feel,

2370
01:50:06,569 --> 01:50:09,238
and he might not be sure about how he feels about me either.

2371
01:50:09,239 --> 01:50:12,110
How would he when we've only been on one date?

2372
01:50:12,279 --> 01:50:15,248
- But... - So I wanted to go on another date,

2373
01:50:15,249 --> 01:50:17,778
but all of a sudden, I randomly have to...

2374
01:50:17,779 --> 01:50:19,589
go on a date with Jung Sub.

2375
01:50:19,590 --> 01:50:21,488
This day is just...

2376
01:50:21,489 --> 01:50:23,418
I think things went wrong because I chose Ju Yeon.

2377
01:50:23,419 --> 01:50:26,359
- Yes. It's your fault. - Why is it my fault?

2378
01:50:26,360 --> 01:50:27,488
It is your fault.

2379
01:50:27,489 --> 01:50:30,459
Why would they give me such an excessive authority?

2380
01:50:31,260 --> 01:50:33,199
Go take a shower. You have the chicken fight.

2381
01:50:37,970 --> 01:50:42,510
(The third day in Singapore)

2382
01:50:45,180 --> 01:50:47,949
(Someone has taken over the pool again, today.)

2383
01:50:54,890 --> 01:50:57,020
(The Kim siblings are asleep in the same position.)

2384
01:51:05,499 --> 01:51:06,529
Who is it?

2385
01:51:06,629 --> 01:51:08,569
- Cheol Hyeon. - Cheol Hyeon?

2386
01:51:09,069 --> 01:51:10,539
Is Cheol Hyeon swimming again?

2387
01:51:27,919 --> 01:51:28,958
What are you up to?

2388
01:51:28,959 --> 01:51:30,159
Don't you have to shower?

2389
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:31,930
I should.

2390
01:51:32,190 --> 01:51:34,159
Where is this happening at 11am?

2391
01:51:34,489 --> 01:51:35,600
What time is it right now?

2392
01:51:35,900 --> 01:51:37,060
It's 10:17am.

2393
01:51:38,169 --> 01:51:39,169
(Gosh)

2394
01:51:40,970 --> 01:51:42,069
That looks...

2395
01:51:42,100 --> 01:51:43,499
scary to me.

2396
01:51:44,140 --> 01:51:45,169
This spot is perfect.

2397
01:51:45,810 --> 01:51:46,909
I will go upstairs first.

2398
01:51:48,039 --> 01:51:49,110
Bye.

2399
01:51:53,249 --> 01:51:55,050
I went to bed a little past 4am yesterday.

2400
01:51:55,150 --> 01:51:56,150
Doing what?

2401
01:51:56,151 --> 01:51:58,289
I talked to Ji Won.

2402
01:51:58,550 --> 01:52:00,019
- I asked Ji Won... - What?

2403
01:52:00,020 --> 01:52:02,489
I asked Ji Won what her ideal type was.

2404
01:52:03,720 --> 01:52:05,059
(Last night)

2405
01:52:05,060 --> 01:52:07,489
Ji Won, what is your ideal type?

2406
01:52:07,860 --> 01:52:08,958
My ideal type?

2407
01:52:08,959 --> 01:52:10,600
(Well...)

2408
01:52:10,699 --> 01:52:15,199
Someone who works well and is cute.

2409
01:52:15,569 --> 01:52:17,470
"Someone who works well and is cute?"

2410
01:52:18,470 --> 01:52:22,539
I can't give up on the cuteness part.

2411
01:52:22,940 --> 01:52:25,180
So you begin liking someone only when he is cute.

2412
01:52:25,449 --> 01:52:26,879
He needs to be cute...

2413
01:52:27,010 --> 01:52:30,749
so that I can see him as a boyfriend material.

2414
01:52:34,350 --> 01:52:36,989
She likes someone who works well and is cute.

2415
01:52:37,190 --> 01:52:38,459
Yes. That's Jae Hyung.

2416
01:52:39,190 --> 01:52:42,359
I don't know. I just told her that I wanted to go on a date with her.

2417
01:52:42,360 --> 01:52:43,930
I don't want to leave any regrets.

2418
01:52:45,329 --> 01:52:47,499
(Yun Jae wants to say something while brushing his teeth.)

2419
01:52:48,569 --> 01:52:50,439
- Ji Won. - What?

2420
01:52:50,440 --> 01:52:51,440
(Incomprehensible)

2421
01:52:52,039 --> 01:52:53,169
- What? - My hat.

2422
01:52:53,970 --> 01:52:56,239
- My hat. - What?

2423
01:52:56,409 --> 01:52:57,640
- What? - Where is my hat?

2424
01:52:57,779 --> 01:52:59,379
- What? - Where is my hat?

2425
01:53:00,480 --> 01:53:02,680
It's in the trunk. What is wrong with you?

2426
01:53:04,249 --> 01:53:06,220
(Yun Ha ties her hair by herself.)

2427
01:53:06,690 --> 01:53:09,020
My hair looks like chicken.

2428
01:53:10,190 --> 01:53:12,129
Will it be inconvenient if I wear jeans?

2429
01:53:12,730 --> 01:53:14,559
Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen,

2430
01:53:14,560 --> 01:53:16,730
sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty,

2431
01:53:16,829 --> 01:53:18,099
twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three,

2432
01:53:18,100 --> 01:53:19,498
twenty-four, twenty-five,

2433
01:53:19,499 --> 01:53:21,369
twenty-six, twenty-seven, twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty.

2434
01:53:21,869 --> 01:53:22,869
(Ta-da!)

2435
01:53:25,569 --> 01:53:26,569
All right.

2436
01:53:26,840 --> 01:53:28,238
- Hello. - You are very purple...

2437
01:53:28,239 --> 01:53:29,340
- today. - I am hungry.

2438
01:53:29,980 --> 01:53:31,239
Can you do well today?

2439
01:53:31,310 --> 01:53:32,310
I am ruined.

2440
01:53:34,680 --> 01:53:35,949
- Seriously. - Do it.

2441
01:53:37,379 --> 01:53:39,150
You can do it.

2442
01:53:39,650 --> 01:53:41,150
I keep seeing 50 dollars.

2443
01:53:48,730 --> 01:53:50,699
You look cute with your hair tied to the side.

2444
01:53:52,829 --> 01:53:54,529
But I think you will lose in the chicken fight.

2445
01:53:56,369 --> 01:53:58,539
I tied my hair so that I can win in the chicken fight.

2446
01:54:01,039 --> 01:54:02,039
Aren't you going to eat something?

2447
01:54:02,040 --> 01:54:03,310
You should eat for energy.

2448
01:54:04,140 --> 01:54:06,180
- You are pressuring me. - You should eat for energy.

2449
01:54:06,850 --> 01:54:09,050
Yun Jae, how did you do this earlier?

2450
01:54:09,449 --> 01:54:10,520
Thirty minutes.

2451
01:54:11,150 --> 01:54:12,618
- My hair. - I am sorry.

2452
01:54:12,619 --> 01:54:14,090
You fed it to my hair.

2453
01:54:14,890 --> 01:54:16,220
You can do it, okay?

2454
01:54:17,090 --> 01:54:18,118
Be quiet.

2455
01:54:18,119 --> 01:54:19,229
Why is your voice so loud...

2456
01:54:19,230 --> 01:54:20,329
- early in the morning? - You can do it.

2457
01:54:21,060 --> 01:54:22,629
Okay. I will lower my voice.

2458
01:54:22,760 --> 01:54:24,360
At least it's only loud in the morning.

2459
01:54:24,860 --> 01:54:28,269
While brushing his teeth earlier, he kept mumbling about something.

2460
01:54:28,270 --> 01:54:29,969
I was like, "What is he saying?"

2461
01:54:29,970 --> 01:54:31,569
I asked you where my hat was.

2462
01:54:33,369 --> 01:54:35,079
- My goodness. - "Where is my hat?"

2463
01:54:36,640 --> 01:54:37,739
I need to practice.

2464
01:54:38,239 --> 01:54:39,879
I will go over where while practising.

2465
01:54:40,579 --> 01:54:41,819
Gosh, she...

2466
01:54:42,650 --> 01:54:43,679
She hopped over there.

2467
01:54:43,680 --> 01:54:46,749
To give the perfect performance that is at 100 percent,

2468
01:54:46,850 --> 01:54:49,659
I need to practice at 150 to 200 percent.

2469
01:54:52,090 --> 01:54:53,930
(She finished practising at 200 percent.)

2470
01:54:54,560 --> 01:54:55,730
- Did you eat breakfast? - No.

2471
01:54:56,100 --> 01:54:57,430
- Aren't you going to eat it? - I don't eat breakfast.

2472
01:54:58,129 --> 01:54:59,199
A dog is barking.

2473
01:54:59,600 --> 01:55:01,270
- What? - A dog is barking.

2474
01:55:03,800 --> 01:55:05,238
(Chuckling)

2475
01:55:05,239 --> 01:55:06,470
Are you insane?

2476
01:55:07,140 --> 01:55:08,579
A dog really is barking.

2477
01:55:11,480 --> 01:55:13,578
Are jeans uncomfortable for the chicken fight?

2478
01:55:13,579 --> 01:55:15,418
- Give me some tips. - We received a message.

2479
01:55:15,419 --> 01:55:16,419
Oh, no.

2480
01:55:16,819 --> 01:55:18,349
(For a chance to go on a luxury date,)

2481
01:55:18,350 --> 01:55:19,918
(the 1st Women's Chicken Fight will begin.)

2482
01:55:19,919 --> 01:55:21,448
"Please gather around at the third-floor terrace."

2483
01:55:21,449 --> 01:55:23,119
The third-floor terrace.

2484
01:55:23,360 --> 01:55:25,060
"For a chance to go on a luxury date..."

2485
01:55:25,690 --> 01:55:27,129
- Good luck. - Good luck.

2486
01:55:27,659 --> 01:55:29,499
- I bet you will place third. - Good luck.

2487
01:55:29,930 --> 01:55:30,999
Let's go upstairs.

2488
01:55:31,730 --> 01:55:32,899
- All right. - Good luck.

2489
01:55:32,900 --> 01:55:34,100
- Let's go. - Beat everyone in the fight.

2490
01:55:34,470 --> 01:55:35,999
Ji Won, beat everyone.

2491
01:55:36,770 --> 01:55:40,439
(A big match for a luxury date)

2492
01:55:40,440 --> 01:55:44,510
(A competition for the date expenses)

2493
01:55:44,940 --> 01:55:48,249
They are quarrelling to establish a hierarchy.

2494
01:55:50,050 --> 01:55:53,149
(The 1st Women's Chicken Fight)

2495
01:55:53,150 --> 01:55:55,260
"The chicken fight will proceed in the tournament style."

2496
01:55:56,390 --> 01:55:59,528
"Male participants, have an arm wrestling match..."

2497
01:55:59,529 --> 01:56:00,828
- "to determine the winner." - Oh, no.

2498
01:56:00,829 --> 01:56:01,899
Can you do it?

2499
01:56:01,900 --> 01:56:03,828
(They didn't expect an arm wrestling match.)

2500
01:56:03,829 --> 01:56:05,400
Men's arm wrestling match.

2501
01:56:05,730 --> 01:56:07,900
"I will need to arm wrestle."

2502
01:56:08,329 --> 01:56:10,539
I am really bad at arm wrestling.

2503
01:56:11,699 --> 01:56:12,709
I thought, "I am ruined."

2504
01:56:14,209 --> 01:56:15,278
Arm wrestling.

2505
01:56:15,279 --> 01:56:17,039
- Isn't this more important? - Yong Woo.

2506
01:56:17,140 --> 01:56:19,049
Will they have an arm wrestling match first?

2507
01:56:19,050 --> 01:56:20,050
Men's arm wrestling match.

2508
01:56:20,051 --> 01:56:21,818
- Arm wrestling. - It's a match of pride.

2509
01:56:21,819 --> 01:56:22,919
I know. It's a bit...

2510
01:56:23,220 --> 01:56:26,948
"Male participants, pick a member you are the most wary of."

2511
01:56:26,949 --> 01:56:28,618
"The winner will move on to the next match."

2512
01:56:28,619 --> 01:56:30,319
"The last winner will place first."

2513
01:56:30,659 --> 01:56:31,659
(My goodness)

2514
01:56:31,660 --> 01:56:32,959
- Jung Sub. - Okay.

2515
01:56:34,190 --> 01:56:35,199
Hold on.

2516
01:56:35,829 --> 01:56:37,199
An arm wrestling match.

2517
01:56:37,560 --> 01:56:38,999
The winner...

2518
01:56:39,100 --> 01:56:41,770
could determine the list of matches.

2519
01:56:41,970 --> 01:56:46,440
Coming up with the list of matches is incredibly important.

2520
01:56:46,539 --> 01:56:47,840
The strong ones can be put together in a match...

2521
01:56:48,169 --> 01:56:49,179
so that they can waste their energy.

2522
01:56:49,180 --> 01:56:51,140
You can strategise that way.

2523
01:56:52,279 --> 01:56:53,610
I thought, "I am saved."

2524
01:56:54,480 --> 01:56:56,980
"He will place second at the very least."

2525
01:56:57,480 --> 01:57:01,020
Yong Woo looks like he is great at arm wrestling.

2526
01:57:01,220 --> 01:57:04,119
"I just need to do well. He will place 2nd or 1st."

2527
01:57:04,619 --> 01:57:06,659
I bet I will place last.

2528
01:57:06,829 --> 01:57:08,060
We can't do it with 50 dollars.

2529
01:57:08,959 --> 01:57:11,059
I think Yong Woo will place first.

2530
01:57:11,060 --> 01:57:12,329
That isn't true. My arms are weak.

2531
01:57:12,800 --> 01:57:13,930
My arms are weak.

2532
01:57:15,239 --> 01:57:16,270
How annoying.

2533
01:57:16,699 --> 01:57:20,340
There was tension between men.

2534
01:57:21,169 --> 01:57:22,480
I can do it with my left hand.

2535
01:57:23,140 --> 01:57:25,179
I bet Yun Jae is strong.

2536
01:57:25,180 --> 01:57:26,480
- No. - I bet Yun Jae is strong.

2537
01:57:28,110 --> 01:57:29,649
Do we point on the count of three?

2538
01:57:29,650 --> 01:57:30,650
Do we point?

2539
01:57:30,651 --> 01:57:32,050
- One, two, three. - One, two, three.

2540
01:57:33,489 --> 01:57:35,458
- Me? - I knew it.

2541
01:57:35,459 --> 01:57:36,760
- He is strong. - But I will use my left hand.

2542
01:57:37,619 --> 01:57:40,730
These troublemakers lied.

2543
01:57:42,430 --> 01:57:45,970
I felt like everyone had a strategy.

2544
01:57:46,400 --> 01:57:48,429
Yong Woo said that he ran,

2545
01:57:48,430 --> 01:57:49,939
and Yun Jae said that he lifted weights.

2546
01:57:49,940 --> 01:57:53,609
So I thought that Yun Jae was a stronger candidate.

2547
01:57:53,610 --> 01:57:57,110
Since Yun Jae cooks, he would be strong.

2548
01:57:57,209 --> 01:57:59,948
He needs to pick a member he wants to contend against.

2549
01:57:59,949 --> 01:58:02,249
- Then he needs to keep winning. - A contender.

2550
01:58:10,459 --> 01:58:12,390
- I will pick Jae Hyung. - Okay.

2551
01:58:13,060 --> 01:58:14,729
- Yun Jae chose Jae Hyung. - Yun Jae chose Jae Hyung.

2552
01:58:14,730 --> 01:58:16,059
The right hand.

2553
01:58:16,060 --> 01:58:17,198
(The first match, Jae Hyung versus Yun Jae)

2554
01:58:17,199 --> 01:58:19,430
- I am nervous. - He is strong.

2555
01:58:20,270 --> 01:58:21,499
I felt like I would win.

2556
01:58:21,669 --> 01:58:24,970
When I grabbed his hand, I felt like I would win.

2557
01:58:27,069 --> 01:58:29,579
- Make sure it doesn't go over. - Come on.

2558
01:58:30,180 --> 01:58:31,180
Jae Hyung looks strong.

2559
01:58:31,181 --> 01:58:32,409
- Seriously. - He looks strong.

2560
01:58:34,650 --> 01:58:36,350
One, two, three.

2561
01:58:36,879 --> 01:58:38,818
Good luck.

2562
01:58:38,819 --> 01:58:39,919
(Neck-and-neck)

2563
01:58:45,529 --> 01:58:46,590
(Jae Hyung won.)

2564
01:58:47,289 --> 01:58:48,730
What?

2565
01:58:48,930 --> 01:58:50,329
- What? - Did Jae Hyung win?

2566
01:58:50,800 --> 01:58:52,498
We got an unexpected result...

2567
01:58:52,499 --> 01:58:53,929
- from the start. - I can't predict the result.

2568
01:58:53,930 --> 01:58:55,639
How many charms does Jae Hyung have?

2569
01:58:55,640 --> 01:58:56,739
Seriously.

2570
01:58:57,239 --> 01:58:58,300
I don't know anymore.

2571
01:58:59,569 --> 01:59:00,609
- All right. - Well done.

2572
01:59:00,610 --> 01:59:02,140
- Well done, Jae Hyung. - Well done.

2573
01:59:02,940 --> 01:59:04,278
Please give me a card.

2574
01:59:04,279 --> 01:59:08,578
Since Yun Jae used a lot of kitchen tools,

2575
01:59:08,579 --> 01:59:10,180
I thought he would have strong arms.

2576
01:59:10,850 --> 01:59:13,090
But he wasn't as good as I thought. Does he use light knives?

2577
01:59:14,919 --> 01:59:17,520
I felt bad for Ju Yeon.

2578
01:59:18,119 --> 01:59:19,759
Had I placed first, we would have had a nice date.

2579
01:59:19,760 --> 01:59:20,789
But...

2580
01:59:21,390 --> 01:59:23,360
I didn't do well. I felt really bad.

2581
01:59:24,199 --> 01:59:26,099
Jae Hyung, pick the next person.

2582
01:59:26,100 --> 01:59:27,230
Do I get to pick?

2583
01:59:29,440 --> 01:59:30,599
I will go out with a bang.

2584
01:59:30,600 --> 01:59:32,038
(Jae Hyung chooses Yong Woo.)

2585
01:59:32,039 --> 01:59:33,039
Okay.

2586
01:59:33,040 --> 01:59:35,509
- It will happen anyway. - It isn't a bad choice.

2587
01:59:35,510 --> 01:59:36,979
He chose Yong Woo.

2588
01:59:36,980 --> 01:59:38,309
He should pick the strongest one.

2589
01:59:38,310 --> 01:59:40,609
Wouldn't he lack the strength since he just had a match?

2590
01:59:40,610 --> 01:59:41,748
Since it's the second match,

2591
01:59:41,749 --> 01:59:43,248
- his arm would be weak. - Seriously.

2592
01:59:43,249 --> 01:59:45,849
There is no need to waste strength by going against a weak one.

2593
01:59:45,850 --> 01:59:46,890
That's right.

2594
01:59:48,190 --> 01:59:49,389
(My goodness)

2595
01:59:49,390 --> 01:59:50,489
Look at his muscles.

2596
01:59:51,690 --> 01:59:54,129
I thought that I would lose against Yong Woo.

2597
01:59:54,529 --> 01:59:57,328
I thought it would be nice to challenge the strongest one...

2598
01:59:57,329 --> 01:59:59,099
and take my chance.

2599
01:59:59,100 --> 02:00:01,470
If I win, it would be incredible.

2600
02:00:01,629 --> 02:00:04,400
Even if I lose, it wouldn't be bad.

2601
02:00:04,600 --> 02:00:07,669
So I decided to give it a go. That was the mindset I had.

2602
02:00:07,810 --> 02:00:09,209
One, two, three.

2603
02:00:11,340 --> 02:00:13,448
(He uses all his might.)

2604
02:00:13,449 --> 02:00:14,480
Jae Hyung.

2605
02:00:15,209 --> 02:00:16,220
Jae Hyung.

2606
02:00:16,850 --> 02:00:18,720
(Yong Woo won.)

2607
02:00:19,020 --> 02:00:20,249
I went down heroically.

2608
02:00:20,489 --> 02:00:21,788
- Seriously. - He was relaxed.

2609
02:00:21,789 --> 02:00:22,958
Yong Woo...

2610
02:00:22,959 --> 02:00:24,618
- He couldn't win. - Yong Woo was on another level.

2611
02:00:24,619 --> 02:00:26,488
- He couldn't win. - Jae Hyung was at a disadvantage.

2612
02:00:26,489 --> 02:00:27,489
Really? Why?

2613
02:00:27,490 --> 02:00:28,929
Jae Hyung's arm was too straight.

2614
02:00:28,930 --> 02:00:31,028
Yong Woo was sitting too close. His body was positioned right.

2615
02:00:31,029 --> 02:00:32,299
Hold on.

2616
02:00:32,300 --> 02:00:34,599
Aren't you too heartbroken about Jae Hyung's loss?

2617
02:00:34,600 --> 02:00:36,099
A game needs to be fair.

2618
02:00:36,100 --> 02:00:37,799
When you arm wrestle,

2619
02:00:37,800 --> 02:00:39,668
you begin by securing the elbow.

2620
02:00:39,669 --> 02:00:41,440
Jae Hyung would have lost even if he had done that.

2621
02:00:42,140 --> 02:00:43,680
That's right. It would have been hard for him to win.

2622
02:00:44,340 --> 02:00:45,379
That's right.

2623
02:00:45,480 --> 02:00:47,350
- Well done. - He is strong.

2624
02:00:50,079 --> 02:00:51,578
- Is it my turn? - Choose a member.

2625
02:00:51,579 --> 02:00:52,590
I will choose...

2626
02:00:54,090 --> 02:00:55,149
(Looking someplace else)

2627
02:00:55,150 --> 02:00:58,520
Someone was looking at the floor.

2628
02:01:01,129 --> 02:01:04,230
He was my favourite person,

2629
02:01:04,499 --> 02:01:05,869
so I chose him.

2630
02:01:06,270 --> 02:01:08,300
I will choose my Hyeon.

2631
02:01:08,869 --> 02:01:09,869
Hyeon.

2632
02:01:09,870 --> 02:01:11,668
- Hyeon. - I will go down heroically.

2633
02:01:11,669 --> 02:01:12,769
My goodness.

2634
02:01:12,770 --> 02:01:16,279
(A match against Hyeon, Yong Woo's favourite person)

2635
02:01:16,779 --> 02:01:19,249
(The pineapple boy advances with a bye.)

2636
02:01:19,810 --> 02:01:21,378
One, two, three.

2637
02:01:21,379 --> 02:01:22,379
Use your muscles.

2638
02:01:25,590 --> 02:01:27,419
Cheol Hyeon.

2639
02:01:27,819 --> 02:01:28,860
Oh, no.

2640
02:01:30,119 --> 02:01:32,190
- He is too strong. - Well done.

2641
02:01:32,829 --> 02:01:34,029
Cheol Hyeon is strong.

2642
02:01:35,289 --> 02:01:38,800
Yong Woo created the perfect picture.

2643
02:01:39,129 --> 02:01:41,199
I did my best, and he made it look like...

2644
02:01:41,300 --> 02:01:42,868
he was putting his muscles to work.

2645
02:01:42,869 --> 02:01:45,198
I pushed hard, but it didn't do much.

2646
02:01:45,199 --> 02:01:46,270
So...

2647
02:01:46,940 --> 02:01:48,669
I hoped that he would take me out quickly.

2648
02:01:50,539 --> 02:01:52,650
Cheol Hyeon swam too much in the morning.

2649
02:01:53,650 --> 02:01:54,980
He exhausted his arms then.

2650
02:01:55,819 --> 02:01:58,079
- Only one remains. - He has a lot of strength left.

2651
02:01:58,180 --> 02:01:59,618
Whose date is Jung Sub?

2652
02:01:59,619 --> 02:02:01,220
- It's me. - It's Ji Won.

2653
02:02:02,690 --> 02:02:03,959
You should have exercised in the morning.

2654
02:02:09,659 --> 02:02:10,900
Are you ready?

2655
02:02:11,430 --> 02:02:13,100
No. Do it properly.

2656
02:02:15,329 --> 02:02:17,599
People with body hair are strong.

2657
02:02:17,600 --> 02:02:20,539
When you go to Eastern European countries,

2658
02:02:20,640 --> 02:02:22,980
people with body hair tend to be big-boned.

2659
02:02:23,640 --> 02:02:25,579
Since Jung Sub has a lot of body hair,

2660
02:02:26,209 --> 02:02:28,819
I thought he would be a tough opponent.

2661
02:02:29,379 --> 02:02:30,878
So Jung Sub has a lot of body hair.

2662
02:02:30,879 --> 02:02:32,350
Yes, he does.

2663
02:02:32,550 --> 02:02:34,020
I heard that he removes them.

2664
02:02:35,720 --> 02:02:40,060
I thought Jung Sub might be the winner.

2665
02:02:40,360 --> 02:02:42,059
His latissimus dorsi muscles are strong.

2666
02:02:42,060 --> 02:02:43,958
I thought he might beat everyone...

2667
02:02:43,959 --> 02:02:46,300
with the strength of his latissimus dorsi muscles.

2668
02:02:46,829 --> 02:02:48,868
(If he wins, he will place 2nd.)

2669
02:02:48,869 --> 02:02:50,139
- One... - Hold on.

2670
02:02:50,140 --> 02:02:51,970
You are twisting it.

2671
02:02:52,510 --> 02:02:54,940
When I held Yong Woo's hand,

2672
02:02:55,039 --> 02:02:56,310
I thought, "This is a match..."

2673
02:02:58,239 --> 02:02:59,279
"I really want to win."

2674
02:03:02,949 --> 02:03:05,180
Arm wrestling is a matter of pride.

2675
02:03:05,989 --> 02:03:07,649
It's a matter of pride.

2676
02:03:07,650 --> 02:03:11,389
Suddenly, I got the desire to do well.

2677
02:03:11,390 --> 02:03:13,760
I could feel his strength when I held his hand.

2678
02:03:13,890 --> 02:03:16,829
I thought, "I might be able to win."

2679
02:03:17,060 --> 02:03:19,769
When I grabbed Jung Sub's hand,

2680
02:03:19,770 --> 02:03:22,899
I realized that I should have picked him first.

2681
02:03:22,900 --> 02:03:24,400
One, two, three.

2682
02:03:30,980 --> 02:03:32,010
Nice.

2683
02:03:33,350 --> 02:03:34,980
They are neck-and-neck.

2684
02:03:35,619 --> 02:03:37,150
- Gosh. - We need to hold the table.

2685
02:03:40,890 --> 02:03:43,059
He is holding out. Jung Sub is strong.

2686
02:03:43,060 --> 02:03:45,260
- He is strong. - They need to hold the table.

2687
02:03:45,390 --> 02:03:46,860
Jung Sub is no joke.

2688
02:03:51,060 --> 02:03:53,470
(The match of strength pushes the table.)

2689
02:03:54,069 --> 02:03:55,969
- My goodness. - Gosh.

2690
02:03:55,970 --> 02:03:58,939
To be honest, I felt like Yong Woo had gone easy...

2691
02:03:58,940 --> 02:04:00,639
on the previous opponents.

2692
02:04:00,640 --> 02:04:04,378
But when it was Jung Sub's turn, he did it with all his might.

2693
02:04:04,379 --> 02:04:06,149
Their faces turned red.

2694
02:04:06,150 --> 02:04:07,209
It was so much fun.

2695
02:04:08,209 --> 02:04:10,319
- Let's start over. - My goodness.

2696
02:04:10,480 --> 02:04:12,318
You need to put something...

2697
02:04:12,319 --> 02:04:14,589
- under the legs. - We should hold the table.

2698
02:04:14,590 --> 02:04:16,520
- I think I hurt my ligament. - Let's use our left hands.

2699
02:04:16,659 --> 02:04:17,690
- Shall we use our left hands? - Yes.

2700
02:04:19,190 --> 02:04:20,260
Okay.

2701
02:04:22,499 --> 02:04:25,360
- Gosh, Jung Sub is strong. - Seriously.

2702
02:04:25,900 --> 02:04:28,668
I root for Yong Woo more.

2703
02:04:28,669 --> 02:04:30,199
It's a match, after all.

2704
02:04:30,440 --> 02:04:31,568
Okay. Left hands.

2705
02:04:31,569 --> 02:04:33,168
- Left hands? - I am not familiar with it.

2706
02:04:33,169 --> 02:04:34,770
Secure the elbow...

2707
02:04:34,869 --> 02:04:36,078
- so that you don't get hurt. - Okay.

2708
02:04:36,079 --> 02:04:39,110
(Pride and a bye depend on this match.)

2709
02:04:39,249 --> 02:04:40,949
One, two, three.

2710
02:04:58,159 --> 02:04:59,198
(Yong Woo won.)

2711
02:04:59,199 --> 02:05:00,199
The two hands...

2712
02:05:01,300 --> 02:05:02,440
All right.

2713
02:05:02,970 --> 02:05:03,970
I did everything.

2714
02:05:04,470 --> 02:05:05,770
I did everything.

2715
02:05:06,140 --> 02:05:07,669
- I did everything. - Yun Ha.

2716
02:05:07,909 --> 02:05:09,908
I should have exercised this morning.

2717
02:05:09,909 --> 02:05:11,980
- But... - The balance wasn't bad.

2718
02:05:12,110 --> 02:05:14,010
It was just right.

2719
02:05:16,050 --> 02:05:18,278
You can do well now.

2720
02:05:18,279 --> 02:05:20,288
I thought, "He really is strong."

2721
02:05:20,289 --> 02:05:21,949
I wasn't a bit disappointed. I was very disappointed.

2722
02:05:24,360 --> 02:05:25,859
Make a three-second eye contact...

2723
02:05:25,860 --> 02:05:27,559
and pick the one who gives you the right vibe.

2724
02:05:27,560 --> 02:05:29,429
- Let's be polite. - Make a three-second eye contact.

2725
02:05:29,430 --> 02:05:31,128
You should help Jung Sub eat tasty food, Yun Ha.

2726
02:05:31,129 --> 02:05:33,069
That's right, Yun Ha. I struggled a lot.

2727
02:05:33,730 --> 02:05:35,469
I think you have eaten a lot of tasty food.

2728
02:05:35,470 --> 02:05:36,999
- No. - No?

2729
02:05:39,869 --> 02:05:41,469
(Discussing)

2730
02:05:41,470 --> 02:05:43,180
Okay.

2731
02:05:43,640 --> 02:05:44,708
No.

2732
02:05:44,709 --> 02:05:46,480
She wants to go to a nice place today.

2733
02:05:47,150 --> 02:05:48,549
- Her strategy... - She is full of greed.

2734
02:05:48,550 --> 02:05:52,180
- A nice place. - I think I will do very badly.

2735
02:05:52,520 --> 02:05:55,219
The first match will be between Cho A...

2736
02:05:55,220 --> 02:05:56,359
(Cho A)

2737
02:05:56,360 --> 02:05:57,389
and Se Seung.

2738
02:05:57,390 --> 02:05:58,590
(Cho A versus Se Seung)

2739
02:05:58,989 --> 02:06:01,859
Let's go over the rules.

2740
02:06:01,860 --> 02:06:03,959
If both of your arms come off, you lose.

2741
02:06:09,669 --> 02:06:12,610
She was like a graceful crane, not a chicken.

2742
02:06:15,980 --> 02:06:17,510
(Who do you think will win?)

2743
02:06:17,709 --> 02:06:18,709
Cho A.

2744
02:06:19,980 --> 02:06:23,549
I saw Se Seung holding one leg the day before.

2745
02:06:23,550 --> 02:06:26,689
It seemed like she didn't have a sense of balance.

2746
02:06:26,690 --> 02:06:29,389
As for Cho A, it looked like...

2747
02:06:29,390 --> 02:06:31,260
she would hold out in a relaxed state.

2748
02:06:33,190 --> 02:06:34,260
Come closer.

2749
02:06:35,659 --> 02:06:38,198
- The cool down time is too short. - Cho A.

2750
02:06:38,199 --> 02:06:40,828
I looked at her with killing intent in my eyes.

2751
02:06:40,829 --> 02:06:42,270
I thought, "I must win."

2752
02:06:42,669 --> 02:06:44,439
"I can't place last."

2753
02:06:44,440 --> 02:06:48,010
That was when I could see that Se Seung was Jae Hyung's sister.

2754
02:06:48,239 --> 02:06:50,179
She had killing intent in her eyes.

2755
02:06:50,180 --> 02:06:51,879
It was beyond madness. It was killing intent.

2756
02:06:52,209 --> 02:06:54,879
I thought I was looking at a fighter chicken.

2757
02:06:55,680 --> 02:06:56,749
Se Seung, let's go.

2758
02:06:56,980 --> 02:06:59,849
When you play a game, sibling relationships don't matter.

2759
02:06:59,850 --> 02:07:01,988
A game should be played fairly.

2760
02:07:01,989 --> 02:07:04,360
Because of that, I rooted for Se Seung.

2761
02:07:04,619 --> 02:07:06,628
- You did well. - Let's go.

2762
02:07:06,629 --> 02:07:07,629
Let's begin.

2763
02:07:07,630 --> 02:07:08,988
Is everyone betting on Cho A?

2764
02:07:08,989 --> 02:07:10,128
- Cho A versus Se Seung? - I...

2765
02:07:10,129 --> 02:07:11,759
- Hold on. - I think Se Seung will win.

2766
02:07:11,760 --> 02:07:13,399
- My choice is Cho A. - What? My choice is Se Seung.

2767
02:07:13,400 --> 02:07:15,498
I think Se Seung will fight passionately.

2768
02:07:15,499 --> 02:07:16,538
My choice is Cho A.

2769
02:07:16,539 --> 02:07:17,839
- Same here. - Really?

2770
02:07:17,840 --> 02:07:19,038
I think she will have techniques.

2771
02:07:19,039 --> 02:07:20,039
I see.

2772
02:07:20,040 --> 02:07:21,909
I think Cho A will fly in the air.

2773
02:07:23,379 --> 02:07:24,440
She is so light.

2774
02:07:24,709 --> 02:07:26,309
(Chicken fight for the date, the first round)

2775
02:07:26,310 --> 02:07:29,010
That whistle sounded like Jae Hyung's voice.

2776
02:07:30,050 --> 02:07:31,850
This is driving me crazy.

2777
02:07:32,520 --> 02:07:35,150
I am scared. Seriously, I am scared.

2778
02:07:35,419 --> 02:07:36,459
My goodness.

2779
02:07:39,860 --> 02:07:41,158
We have the same strategy.

2780
02:07:41,159 --> 02:07:42,899
- I am sorry, Cho A. - They are holding out.

2781
02:07:42,900 --> 02:07:44,599
- They are holding out. - Cho A, you should just attack.

2782
02:07:44,600 --> 02:07:45,629
Right?

2783
02:07:48,029 --> 02:07:49,699
Why are you so tall?

2784
02:07:50,869 --> 02:07:52,839
- No. - My goodness.

2785
02:07:52,840 --> 02:07:54,770
- She is so graceful. - No.

2786
02:07:55,409 --> 02:07:57,440
- Why are you so tall? - She is tall.

2787
02:07:58,079 --> 02:08:01,050
- She has a strong core. - Seriously.

2788
02:08:01,379 --> 02:08:02,520
(Hopping backward)

2789
02:08:02,619 --> 02:08:04,549
- I am exhausted. - Her body is toned.

2790
02:08:04,550 --> 02:08:06,248
- Se Seung is exhausted. - Cho A,

2791
02:08:06,249 --> 02:08:08,448
- don't waste your energy. - She is exhausted.

2792
02:08:08,449 --> 02:08:10,659
- She is exhausted. - Se Seung will be out soon.

2793
02:08:11,590 --> 02:08:12,659
That's incredible.

2794
02:08:14,360 --> 02:08:15,390
Okay.

2795
02:08:17,400 --> 02:08:18,458
That's incredible.

2796
02:08:18,459 --> 02:08:19,799
(Cho A presses down.)

2797
02:08:19,800 --> 02:08:21,400
(Se Seung counterattacks by lifting up.)

2798
02:08:23,440 --> 02:08:25,840
- That was incredible. - Gosh, Se Seung.

2799
02:08:26,610 --> 02:08:28,868
My goodness. Nice.

2800
02:08:28,869 --> 02:08:29,879
(Se Seung won.)

2801
02:08:30,209 --> 02:08:32,309
After winning, I became even more nervous.

2802
02:08:32,310 --> 02:08:34,050
I was like, "I can do this."

2803
02:08:35,150 --> 02:08:37,150
"If I have the will, I will place first."

2804
02:08:37,379 --> 02:08:38,449
Next.

2805
02:08:38,919 --> 02:08:40,689
- Oh, no. - Good luck.

2806
02:08:40,690 --> 02:08:41,989
- Well done. - It's okay.

2807
02:08:42,959 --> 02:08:44,019
I went down heroically.

2808
02:08:44,020 --> 02:08:46,089
Ji Won looked strong.

2809
02:08:46,090 --> 02:08:47,760
I knew that it wouldn't be easy.

2810
02:08:48,060 --> 02:08:49,260
We need to decide on it.

2811
02:08:50,060 --> 02:08:51,459
Aren't you too tall?

2812
02:08:54,569 --> 02:08:56,069
I think there will be a twist.

2813
02:08:56,400 --> 02:08:58,100
- Don't be flustered. - Let's begin.

2814
02:08:58,400 --> 02:08:59,669
From the moment she bent her leg,

2815
02:08:59,909 --> 02:09:02,739
I thought that my sister didn't stand a chance.

2816
02:09:03,039 --> 02:09:05,078
Due to her mean looks,

2817
02:09:05,079 --> 02:09:06,479
people think that she is strong.

2818
02:09:06,480 --> 02:09:08,379
- Let's go. - Press her down.

2819
02:09:08,550 --> 02:09:09,550
Go.

2820
02:09:09,551 --> 02:09:10,578
(A war of nerves)

2821
02:09:10,579 --> 02:09:12,318
This is awkward.

2822
02:09:12,319 --> 02:09:14,190
They are examining each other while standing still.

2823
02:09:14,419 --> 02:09:15,788
(She moves forward.)

2824
02:09:15,789 --> 02:09:17,060
That's good. Let's go.

2825
02:09:18,459 --> 02:09:19,489
Come on.

2826
02:09:20,360 --> 02:09:22,390
- Hold on. - I heard a thud.

2827
02:09:22,659 --> 02:09:23,659
It was heavy.

2828
02:09:24,499 --> 02:09:27,300
If she presses down on my knee, I will get buried in the ground.

2829
02:09:28,430 --> 02:09:29,769
- I felt her strength. - It's okay to get buried.

2830
02:09:29,770 --> 02:09:30,900
My goodness.

2831
02:09:31,400 --> 02:09:34,269
- My goodness. - Put down the knee.

2832
02:09:34,270 --> 02:09:36,980
- Put down the knee. - Gosh.

2833
02:09:37,379 --> 02:09:38,579
I am exhausted.

2834
02:09:42,550 --> 02:09:43,550
She is good.

2835
02:09:43,650 --> 02:09:44,679
(The consecutive attacks made her let go of her leg.)

2836
02:09:44,680 --> 02:09:45,680
Her hands came off.

2837
02:09:47,850 --> 02:09:48,890
She is really good.

2838
02:09:49,690 --> 02:09:51,720
- Seriously. - She has Yong Woo's blood.

2839
02:09:52,060 --> 02:09:54,458
It wasn't easy. I think we were neck-and-neck.

2840
02:09:54,459 --> 02:09:57,159
It was a match between the stronger ones.

2841
02:10:00,470 --> 02:10:01,498
The 4th and 5th places.

2842
02:10:01,499 --> 02:10:03,600
Ji Won, your face tells me that you will get 50 dollars.

2843
02:10:05,800 --> 02:10:08,239
It's okay. We agreed to go to the night market.

2844
02:10:10,579 --> 02:10:12,208
- Get ready. - Get ready.

2845
02:10:12,209 --> 02:10:13,209
(Ji Won versus Cho A)

2846
02:10:13,949 --> 02:10:15,650
That's good.

2847
02:10:15,850 --> 02:10:17,079
Ji Won, let's go.

2848
02:10:17,279 --> 02:10:19,288
- Is it a yoga class? - I have seen this somewhere.

2849
02:10:19,289 --> 02:10:20,418
I think it's a yoga class.

2850
02:10:20,419 --> 02:10:21,719
I have seen this kind of a chicken fight.

2851
02:10:21,720 --> 02:10:23,060
I am worried about Ji Won.

2852
02:10:23,390 --> 02:10:24,390
No.

2853
02:10:26,159 --> 02:10:27,229
(Flustered)

2854
02:10:27,230 --> 02:10:28,329
She was like, "Not a chance."

2855
02:10:28,560 --> 02:10:30,900
- She is not moving. - She is rooted to the ground.

2856
02:10:31,060 --> 02:10:33,270
- She is like a tree. - It's neck-and-neck.

2857
02:10:34,699 --> 02:10:36,499
- Again. - My goodness.

2858
02:10:36,940 --> 02:10:37,969
Ding-dong.

2859
02:10:37,970 --> 02:10:38,970
(Welcome.)

2860
02:10:39,909 --> 02:10:41,369
- How scary. - Let's end it fast.

2861
02:10:44,440 --> 02:10:45,509
(4th place, Cho A and Jae Hyung: 100 dollars)

2862
02:10:45,510 --> 02:10:46,748
- What? - That was incredible.

2863
02:10:46,749 --> 02:10:48,879
- All right. You did well. - We avoided placing last.

2864
02:10:49,680 --> 02:10:51,419
- We can play well with 50 dollars. - Right.

2865
02:10:51,520 --> 02:10:55,220
I couldn't even stand steadily. I went down.

2866
02:10:55,890 --> 02:10:57,860
(Semifinal, Ju Yeon versus Se Seung)

2867
02:10:58,690 --> 02:11:01,430
It will be more nerve-racking than the final.

2868
02:11:01,730 --> 02:11:03,230
I thought Ju Yeon would win.

2869
02:11:03,459 --> 02:11:07,669
Ju Yeon was like a relaxed peacock.

2870
02:11:08,400 --> 02:11:11,840
Se Seung was like a short sparrow.

2871
02:11:12,169 --> 02:11:13,169
I was scared.

2872
02:11:13,170 --> 02:11:15,639
When Ju Yeon and Ji Won had a match,

2873
02:11:15,640 --> 02:11:17,539
I heard a thud.

2874
02:11:18,010 --> 02:11:19,209
I was like, "I am in trouble."

2875
02:11:19,510 --> 02:11:20,679
(A sparrow before a peacock)

2876
02:11:20,680 --> 02:11:22,610
I am so nervous.

2877
02:11:22,680 --> 02:11:23,748
What's up with her?

2878
02:11:23,749 --> 02:11:25,579
- My goodness. - "What's up with her?"

2879
02:11:26,850 --> 02:11:30,658
Gosh, Se Seung, lower your body.

2880
02:11:30,659 --> 02:11:33,889
I was thinking about what to do and trying to calculate...

2881
02:11:33,890 --> 02:11:35,190
the height of Ju Yeon's knee.

2882
02:11:36,400 --> 02:11:38,560
(Her eyes are fixed on Ju Yeon's knee.)

2883
02:11:43,400 --> 02:11:45,198
- Se Seung is good. - It's a proper match.

2884
02:11:45,199 --> 02:11:46,339
My goodness.

2885
02:11:46,340 --> 02:11:47,569
All right.

2886
02:11:51,209 --> 02:11:52,480
- Gosh. - Gosh.

2887
02:11:52,680 --> 02:11:54,310
Attack from the bottom and lift up the knee.

2888
02:11:54,980 --> 02:11:57,149
I could see...

2889
02:11:57,150 --> 02:11:58,649
the up and down movements.

2890
02:11:58,650 --> 02:12:00,689
I pretended to engage...

2891
02:12:00,690 --> 02:12:02,190
and lowered my knee when she lowered hers.

2892
02:12:02,390 --> 02:12:03,559
It was an attempt to throw her off balance.

2893
02:12:03,560 --> 02:12:05,260
(Glint)

2894
02:12:05,560 --> 02:12:07,260
Se Seung, hold out well.

2895
02:12:08,260 --> 02:12:09,400
All right.

2896
02:12:15,270 --> 02:12:17,840
- That's good. - Seriously.

2897
02:12:20,310 --> 02:12:21,610
- Hey. - Gosh.

2898
02:12:25,480 --> 02:12:27,550
I pretended to engage...

2899
02:12:28,379 --> 02:12:30,180
and lowered my knee when she lowered hers.

2900
02:12:31,150 --> 02:12:32,279
It was an attempt to throw her off balance.

2901
02:12:33,690 --> 02:12:34,919
- I am sorry. - Who did it first?

2902
02:12:35,020 --> 02:12:36,689
- I did it first. - You won.

2903
02:12:36,690 --> 02:12:37,760
My hands came off.

2904
02:12:40,529 --> 02:12:42,529
My goodness.

2905
02:12:42,900 --> 02:12:43,929
She had a strategy.

2906
02:12:43,930 --> 02:12:46,229
She is so smart. What is up with Se Seung?

2907
02:12:46,230 --> 02:12:47,770
How did it go as she planned?

2908
02:12:48,329 --> 02:12:49,639
- A strategy consultant. - A consultant.

2909
02:12:49,640 --> 02:12:52,369
Having the right strategy is important.

2910
02:12:54,440 --> 02:12:55,569
Will we place first?

2911
02:12:56,110 --> 02:12:57,179
My goodness.

2912
02:12:57,180 --> 02:12:59,038
- You are good. You did so well. - What?

2913
02:12:59,039 --> 02:13:01,208
I will feed my date.

2914
02:13:01,209 --> 02:13:02,209
He doesn't need to worry.

2915
02:13:02,210 --> 02:13:04,248
Se Seung won.

2916
02:13:04,249 --> 02:13:06,549
It made me go, "You never know the result."

2917
02:13:06,550 --> 02:13:10,220
Se Seung just might feed me.

2918
02:13:11,619 --> 02:13:13,560
Hold on. I think I need to practice.

2919
02:13:15,329 --> 02:13:17,859
I don't think it's about incredible skills...

2920
02:13:17,860 --> 02:13:19,868
or anything like that.

2921
02:13:19,869 --> 02:13:21,869
It's about being competitive.

2922
02:13:22,029 --> 02:13:23,698
- You can do it. - Good luck.

2923
02:13:23,699 --> 02:13:24,769
(Final match, Yun Ha versus Se Seung)

2924
02:13:24,770 --> 02:13:25,839
Se Seung, good luck.

2925
02:13:25,840 --> 02:13:26,869
(The winner will get a luxury date.)

2926
02:13:27,239 --> 02:13:29,640
Both of you, good luck. Get ready.

2927
02:13:30,079 --> 02:13:31,079
(She puts strength into her stepping foot.)

2928
02:13:31,080 --> 02:13:33,379
With those shiny eyes...

2929
02:13:34,650 --> 02:13:36,778
"Since I came this far, I must place first."

2930
02:13:36,779 --> 02:13:39,050
I was determined. I was like, "Here I come."

2931
02:13:40,319 --> 02:13:42,918
I lifted up my spirits so that I wouldn't lose...

2932
02:13:42,919 --> 02:13:44,760
against her.

2933
02:13:46,020 --> 02:13:48,559
But since Se Seung was out of energy,

2934
02:13:48,560 --> 02:13:51,260
I thought that I might have an advantage.

2935
02:13:52,300 --> 02:13:53,998
I could see...

2936
02:13:53,999 --> 02:13:55,929
her burning willpower.

2937
02:13:55,930 --> 02:13:58,140
I could feel the aura.

2938
02:13:58,300 --> 02:13:59,940
I rooted for my sister.

2939
02:14:01,069 --> 02:14:02,709
"Se Seung, don't place first."

2940
02:14:03,279 --> 02:14:05,179
"The date for the winners will be really nice."

2941
02:14:05,180 --> 02:14:06,249
I had that thought.

2942
02:14:06,510 --> 02:14:08,378
I see that socks are important.

2943
02:14:08,379 --> 02:14:09,409
Seriously.

2944
02:14:14,720 --> 02:14:15,749
You won't come, right?

2945
02:14:19,260 --> 02:14:21,060
(Neither one of them backs down.)

2946
02:14:21,159 --> 02:14:22,190
My goodness.

2947
02:14:25,560 --> 02:14:27,900
- She survived. - What? She survived.

2948
02:14:28,730 --> 02:14:29,738
She is sturdy.

2949
02:14:29,739 --> 02:14:31,640
- Why am I nervous? - Seriously.

2950
02:14:31,970 --> 02:14:32,970
Good luck.

2951
02:14:37,239 --> 02:14:38,578
- They are studying each other. - Watching other matches...

2952
02:14:38,579 --> 02:14:39,579
makes me nervous.

2953
02:14:40,279 --> 02:14:41,979
- My goodness. - Look at that. You can't beat her.

2954
02:14:41,980 --> 02:14:43,149
- My goodness. - You can't beat her.

2955
02:14:43,150 --> 02:14:44,680
Is she a chicken?

2956
02:14:45,520 --> 02:14:47,118
- She is like a fighter chicken. - She doesn't seem like a person.

2957
02:14:47,119 --> 02:14:49,919
I learned today why it's called the chicken fight.

2958
02:14:53,560 --> 02:14:54,729
- They are studying each other. - Watching other matches...

2959
02:14:54,730 --> 02:14:55,789
makes me nervous.

2960
02:14:59,230 --> 02:15:00,829
My goodness.

2961
02:15:10,039 --> 02:15:11,079
They are determined.

2962
02:15:11,779 --> 02:15:12,810
You are good at pressing down.

2963
02:15:13,279 --> 02:15:15,810
- Did it hurt? - You are good at pressing down.

2964
02:15:19,690 --> 02:15:21,619
(Fierce attack)

2965
02:15:22,890 --> 02:15:24,319
- Se Seung is good. - You are good at holding out.

2966
02:15:24,919 --> 02:15:26,429
- I am exhausted. - Se Seung is exhausted.

2967
02:15:26,430 --> 02:15:27,488
She is exhausted.

2968
02:15:27,489 --> 02:15:29,559
- She must be exhausted. - Right. Se Seung is exhausted.

2969
02:15:29,560 --> 02:15:30,560
She went against three people.

2970
02:15:30,900 --> 02:15:33,868
Seriously, Se Seung was using...

2971
02:15:33,869 --> 02:15:35,199
all her might

2972
02:15:36,440 --> 02:15:38,139
At that moment,

2973
02:15:38,140 --> 02:15:39,969
Se Seung probably forgot about me.

2974
02:15:39,970 --> 02:15:42,538
She completely forgot about me.

2975
02:15:42,539 --> 02:15:46,310
She was obsessed with a 1,000-dollar date.

2976
02:15:46,909 --> 02:15:49,049
It was written on Se Seung's face.

2977
02:15:49,050 --> 02:15:50,379
"I must take first place."

2978
02:15:50,650 --> 02:15:54,819
There are times she shows her determined side.

2979
02:15:55,050 --> 02:15:56,419
She was like, "I must win."

2980
02:16:00,360 --> 02:16:01,788
She is out of energy.

2981
02:16:01,789 --> 02:16:03,860
She seemed a bit crazy.

2982
02:16:04,560 --> 02:16:06,569
I was like, "Must she go that far?"

2983
02:16:08,430 --> 02:16:10,539
- She is good. - Se Seung is good.

2984
02:16:11,600 --> 02:16:14,368
Yun Ha held out much better than I expected.

2985
02:16:14,369 --> 02:16:16,140
I was exhausted.

2986
02:16:16,980 --> 02:16:18,480
It was a match of physical strength.

2987
02:16:18,779 --> 02:16:19,949
I think she is out of stamina.

2988
02:16:20,309 --> 02:16:21,809
Now, it's a matter of mental strength.

2989
02:16:24,850 --> 02:16:25,850
Suddenly...

2990
02:16:26,549 --> 02:16:27,919
What is going on?

2991
02:16:37,999 --> 02:16:39,058
(Se Seung's spirits made Yun Ha let go of her leg.)

2992
02:16:39,059 --> 02:16:40,969
- She is really good. - What is up with her?

2993
02:16:42,770 --> 02:16:44,040
- Se Seung. - Se Seung.

2994
02:16:44,299 --> 02:16:46,509
- She is so cool today. - It's all about the spirits.

2995
02:16:46,510 --> 02:16:49,210
- Se Seung is incredible. - She did well.

2996
02:16:49,610 --> 02:16:50,679
That was incredible.

2997
02:16:50,680 --> 02:16:52,078
(1st place, Se Seung and Cheol Hyeon: 1,000 dollars)

2998
02:16:52,079 --> 02:16:53,279
- That was incredible. - She is so strong.

2999
02:16:53,280 --> 02:16:54,350
She is strong.

3000
02:16:54,710 --> 02:16:56,519
She slammed into me...

3001
02:16:56,520 --> 02:16:58,319
like Pikachu.

3002
02:16:58,749 --> 02:17:00,719
Her spirit was like a flash of lightning.

3003
02:17:02,419 --> 02:17:03,488
She was steady.

3004
02:17:03,489 --> 02:17:05,059
She was like a rhino.

3005
02:17:05,319 --> 02:17:06,960
Congratulations.

3006
02:17:07,389 --> 02:17:09,899
I am glad that I got a good rest yesterday.

3007
02:17:10,430 --> 02:17:12,529
I felt so proud.

3008
02:17:12,530 --> 02:17:14,270
Placing first place was good enough.

3009
02:17:14,729 --> 02:17:16,029
But that wasn't all.

3010
02:17:16,030 --> 02:17:18,200
It came with a luxury date.

3011
02:17:18,440 --> 02:17:20,639
I was really excited about that.

3012
02:17:21,139 --> 02:17:24,010
"You worked hard. All right. Have a nice date."

3013
02:17:24,239 --> 02:17:26,710
"Enjoy it. Enjoy the luxuries."

3014
02:17:27,010 --> 02:17:31,019
I like someone who works hard.

3015
02:17:31,020 --> 02:17:33,019
Such a side is attractive.

3016
02:17:33,020 --> 02:17:36,419
So Se Seung seemed very nice.

3017
02:17:36,719 --> 02:17:39,418
If we live together,

3018
02:17:39,419 --> 02:17:41,130
she will lead the family well.

3019
02:17:43,229 --> 02:17:44,700
Hs is suddenly imagining a future with her.

3020
02:17:44,799 --> 02:17:46,829
Did she suddenly become a future wife?

3021
02:17:47,299 --> 02:17:48,429
I can't believe it.

3022
02:17:48,430 --> 02:17:49,529
- How pure. - I see that the chicken fight...

3023
02:17:49,530 --> 02:17:50,999
can start a family.

3024
02:17:51,239 --> 02:17:53,509
Are you serious? Seeing a woman who is good at the chicken fight...

3025
02:17:53,510 --> 02:17:54,969
makes her seem like a future wife.

3026
02:17:56,540 --> 02:17:57,639
Seriously.

3027
02:18:01,409 --> 02:18:02,950
I should marry you.

3028
02:18:04,020 --> 02:18:05,049
I am good at chicken fight.

3029
02:18:06,950 --> 02:18:08,489
First place.

3030
02:18:09,049 --> 02:18:10,119
- Second place. - Second place.

3031
02:18:10,120 --> 02:18:12,889
Third place. Fourth place. Fifth place.

3032
02:18:13,190 --> 02:18:14,190
(The expenses have been determined.)

3033
02:18:14,191 --> 02:18:15,930
- Well done. - Well done.

3034
02:18:16,130 --> 02:18:17,459
You did well.

3035
02:18:17,460 --> 02:18:19,398
The last attack was impressive.

3036
02:18:19,399 --> 02:18:21,030
(Another letter arrives at that moment.)

3037
02:18:21,999 --> 02:18:23,168
The fifth-place winners...

3038
02:18:23,169 --> 02:18:25,039
- It's an envelope. - Really?

3039
02:18:25,040 --> 02:18:26,369
The fifth-place winners will read it.

3040
02:18:26,370 --> 02:18:27,510
We will read it.

3041
02:18:28,710 --> 02:18:30,210
My goodness. What?

3042
02:18:30,880 --> 02:18:32,339
A surprise benefit.

3043
02:18:32,340 --> 02:18:33,350
My goodness.

3044
02:18:34,450 --> 02:18:36,478
I opened the envelope thoughtlessly.

3045
02:18:36,479 --> 02:18:39,279
It was about a benefit for the fifth-place winners,

3046
02:18:39,280 --> 02:18:40,548
so I was very surprised.

3047
02:18:40,549 --> 02:18:41,988
I thought it was nice.

3048
02:18:41,989 --> 02:18:44,459
"Those who place last and got a 50-dollar date..."

3049
02:18:44,460 --> 02:18:47,159
"will get to select someone for a 1-on-1 date tomorrow."

3050
02:18:50,659 --> 02:18:53,269
I realized that I would get a date I wanted,

3051
02:18:53,270 --> 02:18:55,030
so I was very happy.

3052
02:18:55,200 --> 02:18:58,069
I wondered why I had a cramp this morning.

3053
02:18:58,299 --> 02:19:01,469
(She probably trained for the chicken fight in her sleep.)

3054
02:19:02,169 --> 02:19:05,110
(She woke up in the morning due to a muscle cramp.)

3055
02:19:05,940 --> 02:19:07,308
It must have happened so that I could place fifth...

3056
02:19:07,309 --> 02:19:08,610
and get a date.

3057
02:19:08,680 --> 02:19:10,218
I was like, "That was my fate."

3058
02:19:10,219 --> 02:19:13,389
I was thinking about my fate in my head.

3059
02:19:13,690 --> 02:19:14,719
Well done.

3060
02:19:15,749 --> 02:19:17,689
- Thank you for your hard work. - Well done.

3061
02:19:17,690 --> 02:19:19,189
- Let's have fun. - You did well.

3062
02:19:19,190 --> 02:19:21,389
I would have been happy even if you had placed last.

3063
02:19:21,729 --> 02:19:23,360
Se Seung won.

3064
02:19:23,559 --> 02:19:26,059
- She was practically a chicken. - Se Seung was determined.

3065
02:19:26,260 --> 02:19:28,729
The winner.

3066
02:19:28,870 --> 02:19:31,498
With determination to place first,

3067
02:19:31,499 --> 02:19:33,639
I sacrificed my knee. Jae Hyung, my knee hurts.

3068
02:19:34,370 --> 02:19:36,680
I feel like Se Seung is supporting me.

3069
02:19:36,909 --> 02:19:39,340
- Is she supporting you? - Yes.

3070
02:19:39,680 --> 02:19:40,680
Cho A.

3071
02:19:41,450 --> 02:19:42,849
You pressed me down...

3072
02:19:42,850 --> 02:19:44,349
- so that I could get a date. - That's right.

3073
02:19:44,350 --> 02:19:46,049
"Ji Won, go on another date."

3074
02:19:51,389 --> 02:19:53,059
(Looming)

3075
02:19:53,559 --> 02:19:55,829
- Yun Jae. - Yun Jae isn't in the room.

3076
02:19:56,360 --> 02:19:58,298
Looking for Ji Won who will lend me hairspray.

3077
02:19:58,299 --> 02:19:59,630
This is mine.

3078
02:20:00,700 --> 02:20:01,729
Thanks.

3079
02:20:04,139 --> 02:20:06,040
(Looming)

3080
02:20:06,569 --> 02:20:08,169
- Why... - Jae Hyung.

3081
02:20:08,440 --> 02:20:10,040
Jae Hyung...

3082
02:20:10,639 --> 02:20:14,679
is looming because he likes her.

3083
02:20:14,680 --> 02:20:16,210
It's my first time seeing him like that.

3084
02:20:16,880 --> 02:20:17,978
What are you going to wear?

3085
02:20:17,979 --> 02:20:19,248
- Will you wear that? - This is my outfit.

3086
02:20:19,249 --> 02:20:20,249
Is that your outfit?

3087
02:20:20,620 --> 02:20:22,519
- Why? It's the marine look. - It's the marine look.

3088
02:20:22,520 --> 02:20:23,520
(He puts on Ji Won's sunglasses.)

3089
02:20:24,120 --> 02:20:25,519
- I look good in these sunglasses. - Nice.

3090
02:20:25,520 --> 02:20:26,790
- They suit you. - Let me wear these.

3091
02:20:27,860 --> 02:20:28,959
(Turning around)

3092
02:20:28,960 --> 02:20:31,159
I guess you want to look cool for the date.

3093
02:20:31,860 --> 02:20:33,058
(Chuckling)

3094
02:20:33,059 --> 02:20:34,100
Will you wear that outfit?

3095
02:20:34,370 --> 02:20:35,799
- No. - Make sure you do.

3096
02:20:37,399 --> 02:20:38,469
What?

3097
02:20:40,270 --> 02:20:42,110
(The last-place winners' date has been revealed.)

3098
02:20:43,610 --> 02:20:44,839
Bicycle?

3099
02:20:44,840 --> 02:20:45,978
(1. Riding a bicycle 2. Dinner at Lau Pa Sat)

3100
02:20:45,979 --> 02:20:47,479
What is it?

3101
02:20:47,909 --> 02:20:48,979
Did you get the message?

3102
02:20:50,419 --> 02:20:51,419
(Halting)

3103
02:20:51,420 --> 02:20:52,818
- Gosh. - Who wants to go cycling?

3104
02:20:52,819 --> 02:20:54,249
I will cycle diligently.

3105
02:20:54,719 --> 02:20:55,850
What is that?

3106
02:20:56,419 --> 02:20:57,989
- My goodness. - It's nice.

3107
02:20:58,090 --> 02:21:00,229
- Will you go to the night market? - But...

3108
02:21:00,630 --> 02:21:02,988
Why? I like the old restaurant vibe.

3109
02:21:02,989 --> 02:21:04,229
I want to go on this date.

3110
02:21:04,930 --> 02:21:06,770
Let's throw out the original plan.

3111
02:21:07,270 --> 02:21:08,270
And go on this date instead?

3112
02:21:08,271 --> 02:21:10,169
- Let's run away. - That's a nice plan

3113
02:21:10,469 --> 02:21:11,569
We have so much free time.

3114
02:21:12,739 --> 02:21:14,238
After people leave,

3115
02:21:14,239 --> 02:21:15,710
- we can hang out here. - Seriously.

3116
02:21:15,909 --> 02:21:17,978
- Shall I make you lunch? - What?

3117
02:21:17,979 --> 02:21:20,280
- That sounds good. - Please make it now.

3118
02:21:22,749 --> 02:21:24,380
You are wearing makeup today.

3119
02:21:24,520 --> 02:21:25,979
Everyone wears makeup.

3120
02:21:26,049 --> 02:21:28,020
- Didn't you wear it until now? - No.

3121
02:21:28,850 --> 02:21:30,190
What kind of confidence is that?

3122
02:21:30,919 --> 02:21:32,219
Show your charms.

3123
02:21:32,419 --> 02:21:34,429
Park Cheol Hyeon, be confident.

3124
02:21:34,430 --> 02:21:36,590
You have a lot of charms.

3125
02:21:36,700 --> 02:21:37,759
We used up the eggs,

3126
02:21:37,760 --> 02:21:39,029
so I don't know what I should make for Jung Sub.

3127
02:21:39,030 --> 02:21:41,200
- There are ramyeon and pasta. - Ramyeon.

3128
02:21:41,530 --> 02:21:43,669
I should make him pasta.

3129
02:21:44,569 --> 02:21:46,440
Pasta. Make it for me too.

3130
02:21:48,409 --> 02:21:50,478
What was that? "Make it for me too."

3131
02:21:50,479 --> 02:21:51,540
"Make it for me too."

3132
02:21:51,739 --> 02:21:53,779
- I guess he really likes her. - I know. He isn't leaving.

3133
02:21:53,780 --> 02:21:55,409
I feel like they are on a date.

3134
02:21:55,510 --> 02:21:56,648
He likes being with her no matter what.

3135
02:21:56,649 --> 02:21:59,579
Right. He is about to lie down there.

3136
02:21:59,780 --> 02:22:01,989
I should make him pasta.

3137
02:22:02,819 --> 02:22:04,719
Pasta. Make it for me too.

3138
02:22:05,059 --> 02:22:06,059
I will do that.

3139
02:22:06,290 --> 02:22:08,959
If you go out late, it won't be so hot.

3140
02:22:08,960 --> 02:22:11,130
That's right. If I must ride a bicycle now...

3141
02:22:12,399 --> 02:22:13,399
It would be exhausting.

3142
02:22:13,930 --> 02:22:15,129
Riding a bicycle sounds fun.

3143
02:22:15,130 --> 02:22:16,699
- A bicycle? - Can you ride it well?

3144
02:22:16,700 --> 02:22:18,239
Yes, I can ride it well.

3145
02:22:19,069 --> 02:22:21,440
- May I check out this room? - Yes.

3146
02:22:21,540 --> 02:22:22,609
Hello.

3147
02:22:22,610 --> 02:22:24,308
- Do you know when she is leaving? - When?

3148
02:22:24,309 --> 02:22:25,940
- At 4:40pm. - At 4:40pm?

3149
02:22:26,139 --> 02:22:27,610
Since we only have 50 dollars...

3150
02:22:28,149 --> 02:22:29,578
- They shortened the date. - Yes.

3151
02:22:29,579 --> 02:22:30,680
We don't have much to do.

3152
02:22:30,780 --> 02:22:32,218
Who is your date today?

3153
02:22:32,219 --> 02:22:33,548
- Yun Ha? - Yun Ha.

3154
02:22:33,549 --> 02:22:36,019
- She is my last date. - I see.

3155
02:22:36,020 --> 02:22:37,359
I haven't gone on a date with her.

3156
02:22:37,360 --> 02:22:39,360
- It will be fun... - I know.

3157
02:22:39,889 --> 02:22:40,889
for the two of you.

3158
02:22:41,729 --> 02:22:43,530
- Who is your date today? - Jung sub.

3159
02:22:43,799 --> 02:22:44,899
Jung Sub.

3160
02:22:46,899 --> 02:22:48,328
You will have one more date tomorrow.

3161
02:22:48,329 --> 02:22:49,329
Yes.

3162
02:22:49,569 --> 02:22:50,599
Are you jealous?

3163
02:22:50,600 --> 02:22:53,238
Since we are in Singapore, it's nice to go out a lot.

3164
02:22:53,239 --> 02:22:54,510
Tomorrow... What was it?

3165
02:22:56,440 --> 02:22:57,510
Tomorrow...

3166
02:22:57,940 --> 02:23:00,409
What? It's my first time seeing them have a conversation.

3167
02:23:00,649 --> 02:23:02,179
It's the first time...

3168
02:23:02,180 --> 02:23:03,680
- since their date. - Right.

3169
02:23:04,120 --> 02:23:05,780
What? No way.

3170
02:23:06,719 --> 02:23:07,748
This music is a bit...

3171
02:23:07,749 --> 02:23:09,089
- I also thought it was a bit... - Right?

3172
02:23:09,090 --> 02:23:11,459
- It's making me feel strange. - I know.

3173
02:23:11,460 --> 02:23:12,460
What's up with it?

3174
02:23:14,059 --> 02:23:15,790
I don't think that's the mood.

3175
02:23:17,059 --> 02:23:18,260
Tomorrow... What was it?

3176
02:23:20,329 --> 02:23:21,329
Tomorrow...

3177
02:23:21,530 --> 02:23:24,139
Tomorrow, only you and Jung Sub can go outside...

3178
02:23:24,340 --> 02:23:25,638
- with your dates. - That's right.

3179
02:23:25,639 --> 02:23:27,510
- Other people will stay home. - Yes.

3180
02:23:27,739 --> 02:23:29,339
Placing last was the best.

3181
02:23:29,340 --> 02:23:31,909
I told you. When I woke up in the morning,

3182
02:23:32,440 --> 02:23:33,578
I had a cramp in my leg.

3183
02:23:33,579 --> 02:23:34,879
- Really? - I woke up going,

3184
02:23:34,880 --> 02:23:37,578
"My goodness." I woke up like that.

3185
02:23:37,579 --> 02:23:39,748
- It was a good sign. - I am a fatalist.

3186
02:23:39,749 --> 02:23:40,989
That's right. You are a fatalist.

3187
02:23:41,489 --> 02:23:43,249
Something good will happen tomorrow.

3188
02:23:43,350 --> 02:23:46,418
Because you beat Jung Sub,

3189
02:23:46,419 --> 02:23:49,129
- things followed the fate. - Really?

3190
02:23:49,130 --> 02:23:50,259
Was it because I beat Jung Sub?

3191
02:23:50,260 --> 02:23:52,099
You are right. Otherwise, you would have placed second.

3192
02:23:52,100 --> 02:23:53,100
That's right.

3193
02:23:53,700 --> 02:23:55,699
(There is the car.)

3194
02:23:55,700 --> 02:23:58,369
(A luxury car waits for the 1st-place winners.)

3195
02:23:58,370 --> 02:24:00,609
(This is the luxury date!)

3196
02:24:00,610 --> 02:24:02,709
(I told you to believe in me!)

3197
02:24:02,710 --> 02:24:04,908
(The luxury benefits are given out in order.)

3198
02:24:04,909 --> 02:24:06,078
(The car for the 2nd place)

3199
02:24:06,079 --> 02:24:07,850
(The car for the 3rd, 4th, and 5th places)

3200
02:24:09,149 --> 02:24:11,578
(Is it okay? Is it okay to be so nice?)

3201
02:24:11,579 --> 02:24:12,949
(Smell it. It's so nice.)

3202
02:24:12,950 --> 02:24:14,888
(It's so nice.)

3203
02:24:14,889 --> 02:24:17,519
(I am enjoying the luxuries since I met a nice partner.)

3204
02:24:17,520 --> 02:24:19,959
(The taste is 100 percent, and the mood is 120 percent.)

3205
02:24:19,960 --> 02:24:21,129
(The 5th-place team is hungry.)

3206
02:24:21,130 --> 02:24:23,629
(My stomach grumbled.)

3207
02:24:23,630 --> 02:24:26,699
(What can we buy with 7 dollars?)

3208
02:24:26,700 --> 02:24:28,200
(7 dollars? Nothing.)

3209
02:24:29,569 --> 02:24:31,669
- "Seven dollars? Nothing." - "Seven dollars? Nothing."

3210
02:24:32,040 --> 02:24:34,168
(That was what I meant earlier.)

3211
02:24:34,169 --> 02:24:36,539
(It occurred to me that there could be someone...)

3212
02:24:36,540 --> 02:24:39,009
(who makes a completely different decision.)

3213
02:24:39,010 --> 02:24:40,808
(There can't be any big changes.)

3214
02:24:40,809 --> 02:24:42,779
(Why not?)

3215
02:24:42,780 --> 02:24:44,119
(It was perfect.)

3216
02:24:44,120 --> 02:24:45,718
(It was so nice.)

3217
02:24:45,719 --> 02:24:47,218
(Can another situation unfold...)

3218
02:24:47,219 --> 02:24:49,620
(if we have more time?)

3219
02:24:49,819 --> 02:24:51,259
(I wonder if we didn't go on a date sooner...)

3220
02:24:51,260 --> 02:24:52,959
(so that this date could happen.)

3221
02:24:52,960 --> 02:24:54,259
(- Really? - Yes.)

3222
02:24:54,260 --> 02:24:57,058
(When good memories come,)

3223
02:24:57,059 --> 02:24:59,860
(I become quite pensive.)

3224
02:25:02,229 --> 02:25:04,399
(It isn't over until it is.)

3225
02:25:05,969 --> 02:25:10,239
(3 days before the final decision, wind blows in people's hearts.)
