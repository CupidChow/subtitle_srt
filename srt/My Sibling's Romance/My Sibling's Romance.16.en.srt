1
00:00:00,188 --> 00:00:02,956
(Their secret dates the day before the final decision began.)

2
00:00:02,957 --> 00:00:05,897
(What is "final selection" to you?)

3
00:00:05,898 --> 00:00:08,097
(I think my final selection is future-oriented.)

4
00:00:08,098 --> 00:00:09,566
(It's very...)

5
00:00:09,567 --> 00:00:11,296
(It's a lot deeper.)

6
00:00:11,297 --> 00:00:14,066
("Do you think about what comes after the final selection?")

7
00:00:14,067 --> 00:00:15,967
("Then what have I been doing for the past three weeks?")

8
00:00:15,968 --> 00:00:18,607
("Will I get to see Ji Won?")

9
00:00:18,608 --> 00:00:19,906
(I was afraid that...)

10
00:00:19,907 --> 00:00:22,647
(my position might change.)

11
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:24,717
(But I want to believe...)

12
00:00:24,718 --> 00:00:26,247
(in fate this time.)

13
00:00:26,248 --> 00:00:29,747
("What's the prettiest thing you've seen since you came here?")

14
00:00:29,748 --> 00:00:31,987
(I was going to say it was you.)

15
00:00:32,617 --> 00:00:35,687
(Will I accept who I have been?)

16
00:00:35,688 --> 00:00:38,727
(Or will I make a different decision?)

17
00:00:39,358 --> 00:00:43,196
(An unexpected variable was introduced.)

18
00:00:43,197 --> 00:00:45,797
(You'll play Siblings' Truth or Dare starting now.)

19
00:00:46,197 --> 00:00:49,208
(I was determined to reveal the truth about myself.)

20
00:00:49,938 --> 00:00:51,067
(The final decision...)

21
00:00:51,068 --> 00:00:52,777
(I won't make it.)

22
00:00:52,778 --> 00:00:54,438
(It was very shocking.)

23
00:00:54,537 --> 00:00:56,607
(Just what did they talk about for this to happen?)

24
00:00:56,608 --> 00:00:58,247
(I think...)

25
00:00:58,248 --> 00:01:01,447
(there are "No" and two people.)

26
00:01:01,448 --> 00:01:04,687
(I thought she was torn between choosing me and choosing no one.)

27
00:01:04,688 --> 00:01:07,857
(It made me disappointed and confused.)

28
00:01:07,858 --> 00:01:09,656
(It felt good.)

29
00:01:09,657 --> 00:01:12,727
(I don't know how to feel about him anymore.)

30
00:01:12,728 --> 00:01:14,096
(To Se Seung: Everyone takes the final decision differently.)

31
00:01:14,097 --> 00:01:15,396
(I think I also did a bad job of expressing myself.)

32
00:01:15,397 --> 00:01:16,896
(But I still want to get to know you even after this ends.)

33
00:01:16,897 --> 00:01:19,566
(Let's do a good job of climbing over the big mountain.)

34
00:01:19,567 --> 00:01:22,236
(I did everything I could.)

35
00:01:22,237 --> 00:01:25,607
(Today's messages will be delivered after the final decision.)

36
00:01:25,608 --> 00:01:27,676
(Why wasn't that the case this time?)

37
00:01:27,677 --> 00:01:28,677
(It's cruel.)

38
00:01:29,278 --> 00:01:32,618
(Their last night deepens their dilemma.)

39
00:01:35,088 --> 00:01:38,088
(Everyone goes back home.)

40
00:01:39,517 --> 00:01:41,657
(Whining)

41
00:01:42,757 --> 00:01:44,028
Are you okay?

42
00:01:44,157 --> 00:01:46,228
(Whining)

43
00:01:50,627 --> 00:01:51,668
- Are you feeling down? - Yes.

44
00:01:53,797 --> 00:01:54,837
Why?

45
00:01:54,838 --> 00:01:56,137
(Whining)

46
00:01:58,507 --> 00:02:01,847
I didn't know it meant this much to her.

47
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:05,018
What is it? The critical thing she said?

48
00:02:05,718 --> 00:02:06,748
Today.

49
00:02:07,218 --> 00:02:08,447
- Today? - Yes.

50
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:10,488
(Whining)

51
00:02:12,118 --> 00:02:14,718
I could sense that he was really anxious.

52
00:02:14,928 --> 00:02:17,927
I asked him why things got bad between him and Se Seung...

53
00:02:17,928 --> 00:02:20,827
all of a sudden. That's what I asked him first.

54
00:02:21,097 --> 00:02:24,767
Then I only focused on helping him resolve this problem...

55
00:02:24,768 --> 00:02:26,097
with Se Seung.

56
00:02:26,268 --> 00:02:27,567
An emergency planning committee.

57
00:02:28,838 --> 00:02:31,477
I needed my sister's help to resolve this.

58
00:02:31,938 --> 00:02:35,077
(They arrive home.)

59
00:02:38,317 --> 00:02:41,648
If I were to talk to Se Seung now, will it be an emotional argument?

60
00:02:41,817 --> 00:02:44,018
Yes. It might be better if I talk to her first.

61
00:02:46,058 --> 00:02:47,157
Don't you agree?

62
00:02:47,357 --> 00:02:50,126
We need to do something, though.

63
00:02:50,127 --> 00:02:51,157
Right.

64
00:02:54,097 --> 00:02:55,327
Gosh. Seriously.

65
00:03:05,577 --> 00:03:08,208
(Jae Hyung came to see Ji Won.)

66
00:03:08,347 --> 00:03:10,647
Do you think it'll be better if we talk?

67
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:13,077
Or will it be better if we don't? Which will be better for you?

68
00:03:13,518 --> 00:03:14,748
(Nodding)

69
00:03:14,917 --> 00:03:16,148
- Now? - Yes.

70
00:03:17,088 --> 00:03:20,017
(They come out to the terrace.)

71
00:03:20,018 --> 00:03:21,286
- It's okay. - This is the beautiful view...

72
00:03:21,287 --> 00:03:22,528
I told you about.

73
00:03:25,227 --> 00:03:28,827
I didn't know you had a secret date with Yong Woo.

74
00:03:29,768 --> 00:03:31,667
Was it before our date? Or...

75
00:03:31,898 --> 00:03:32,898
No.

76
00:03:32,998 --> 00:03:34,398
- Before our date? - It was before our date.

77
00:03:39,778 --> 00:03:42,748
Then are you trying to decide...

78
00:03:43,548 --> 00:03:45,816
between choosing someone or not choosing anyone?

79
00:03:45,817 --> 00:03:47,048
Right now...

80
00:03:51,048 --> 00:03:52,256
Are you okay here, though? It's raining.

81
00:03:52,257 --> 00:03:53,286
Right.

82
00:03:53,287 --> 00:03:54,416
Let's talk inside.

83
00:03:54,417 --> 00:03:56,357
(The two of them continue their conversation in the room.)

84
00:03:56,627 --> 00:04:00,827
Before joining the show, this is what I had in mind.

85
00:04:01,327 --> 00:04:03,326
Instead of choosing someone very different from me,

86
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:08,168
I wanted to choose someone who was similar to me.

87
00:04:08,408 --> 00:04:11,238
The person I deemed the most similar to me...

88
00:04:11,637 --> 00:04:14,336
was Yong Woo. That thought crossed my mind.

89
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:17,276
During our day-to-day lives, when I observed him,

90
00:04:17,277 --> 00:04:21,918
I did feel that he and I had a lot in common.

91
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:26,418
Then after going on two dates with you,

92
00:04:27,158 --> 00:04:28,826
I sort of felt...

93
00:04:28,827 --> 00:04:33,527
that you and I were very different.

94
00:04:34,527 --> 00:04:37,497
When I realized that, I had a chance...

95
00:04:37,498 --> 00:04:39,867
to talk to Yong Woo.

96
00:04:39,868 --> 00:04:42,966
Almost all the thoughts I had about him...

97
00:04:42,967 --> 00:04:45,137
turned out to be true.

98
00:04:46,678 --> 00:04:47,907
So he wasn't in the picture before.

99
00:04:47,908 --> 00:04:49,177
But after the secret date,

100
00:04:49,178 --> 00:04:51,347
you started to consider him seriously.

101
00:04:51,348 --> 00:04:52,376
Right.

102
00:04:52,377 --> 00:04:54,747
I do need a bit more time.

103
00:04:54,748 --> 00:04:57,418
But it's what you understood.

104
00:05:00,817 --> 00:05:02,956
After talking to her,

105
00:05:02,957 --> 00:05:05,627
all the pieces came together.

106
00:05:06,897 --> 00:05:08,626
So I'm really confused right now.

107
00:05:08,627 --> 00:05:12,637
I don't know what to feel now. It's confusing.

108
00:05:13,767 --> 00:05:14,837
I don't know.

109
00:05:18,238 --> 00:05:21,576
I don't know. But today's game was really tough on me.

110
00:05:21,577 --> 00:05:24,507
I felt as if I was contributing...

111
00:05:24,777 --> 00:05:27,777
to all the negative feelings I sensed during the game.

112
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:35,327
Well, I wouldn't say I find it odd or anything...

113
00:05:35,387 --> 00:05:38,428
that you're considering him only after the secret date.

114
00:05:38,697 --> 00:05:40,397
I can't do anything about romantic attraction.

115
00:05:40,498 --> 00:05:45,038
I do think that it's possible to develop feelings in an instant.

116
00:05:46,767 --> 00:05:50,367
Before you said you were curious about me,

117
00:05:50,368 --> 00:05:51,876
you should think about...

118
00:05:51,877 --> 00:05:53,377
if you were attracted to him, to begin with.

119
00:05:53,707 --> 00:05:57,347
Did you not consider him because of Cho A?

120
00:05:57,348 --> 00:05:58,418
Now that she's not in the picture...

121
00:06:01,478 --> 00:06:03,348
and you might be good with him,

122
00:06:04,817 --> 00:06:06,017
are you considering him now?

123
00:06:07,317 --> 00:06:11,728
First of all, I can't say that...

124
00:06:11,798 --> 00:06:15,467
he came into the picture only after the secret date.

125
00:06:15,527 --> 00:06:18,667
As we lived in the same house,

126
00:06:18,668 --> 00:06:20,297
I saw what kind of person he was.

127
00:06:20,298 --> 00:06:23,807
I must have felt subconsciously that we were similar people.

128
00:06:23,808 --> 00:06:25,108
That could be one of the reasons.

129
00:06:25,277 --> 00:06:28,276
That's why even if things were going well for Cho A and Yong Woo,

130
00:06:28,277 --> 00:06:31,647
I would have chosen him for my secret date.

131
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:40,117
This was something she had been thinking...

132
00:06:40,118 --> 00:06:42,826
and felt conflicted about from the beginning.

133
00:06:42,827 --> 00:06:44,487
The secret date...

134
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:47,998
must have given her some answers. That's probably what happened.

135
00:06:48,467 --> 00:06:51,626
You explained everything to me.

136
00:06:51,627 --> 00:06:53,696
Once I understand it in my head,

137
00:06:53,697 --> 00:06:56,608
I can accept everything.

138
00:06:57,567 --> 00:06:58,678
So I understand everything.

139
00:06:58,777 --> 00:06:59,908
I can tell.

140
00:06:59,938 --> 00:07:01,408
You're very different from me.

141
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:04,608
Why does she care so much about being similar and different?

142
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:07,076
- Are you a thinking type? - Yes.

143
00:07:07,077 --> 00:07:08,918
(Patricia, Jonathan)

144
00:07:09,048 --> 00:07:10,248
You're also a thinking type.

145
00:07:10,348 --> 00:07:11,586
There are many thinking types here.

146
00:07:11,587 --> 00:07:13,918
- You and I are clearly thinkers. - Right.

147
00:07:14,118 --> 00:07:16,387
At one point, Ji Won...

148
00:07:17,257 --> 00:07:19,097
- became closed-off... - Right?

149
00:07:19,098 --> 00:07:21,057
No matter how hard Jae Hyung tried to talk to her.

150
00:07:21,058 --> 00:07:22,566
Why do you keep drawing the line,

151
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,067
- saying that they're different? - Right? I felt that too.

152
00:07:24,197 --> 00:07:26,567
Actually, I didn't ask to meet...

153
00:07:26,767 --> 00:07:28,636
other people for my secret date.

154
00:07:28,637 --> 00:07:32,438
I thought that I only wanted to talk to you again.

155
00:07:33,137 --> 00:07:37,977
I was able to talk to you and go on another date.

156
00:07:37,978 --> 00:07:40,377
So I was really relieved.

157
00:07:42,017 --> 00:07:44,516
I didn't feel insecure. I felt at ease.

158
00:07:44,517 --> 00:07:46,988
I was able to enjoy the ride.

159
00:07:47,688 --> 00:07:48,728
- You did enjoy it, right? - Yes.

160
00:07:49,358 --> 00:07:51,728
- It was fun. - It was.

161
00:07:52,158 --> 00:07:55,497
That's why I'm letting you know more clearly where...

162
00:07:55,498 --> 00:07:57,728
- my heart is headed. - Okay.

163
00:07:59,137 --> 00:08:02,408
I might be burdening you more by telling you this.

164
00:08:02,908 --> 00:08:06,076
But if you were to choose me,

165
00:08:06,077 --> 00:08:08,477
you might need to think about...

166
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:11,647
our relationship more seriously in the future.

167
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:14,376
Anyway, that's how I feel.

168
00:08:14,377 --> 00:08:17,517
I understood precisely what you meant.

169
00:08:19,488 --> 00:08:21,987
Will you stay up all night? Will you go to sleep late or early?

170
00:08:22,888 --> 00:08:24,087
I'm not sure.

171
00:08:24,288 --> 00:08:26,227
You should go out first. I'm going to use the bathroom.

172
00:08:30,428 --> 00:08:32,437
(Jae Hyung came back again.)

173
00:08:32,438 --> 00:08:33,668
- Yes. - Ji Won.

174
00:08:33,768 --> 00:08:36,837
- What? - Yong Woo picked you too, right?

175
00:08:36,967 --> 00:08:37,967
Yes.

176
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:41,737
Probably. He said he had something to tell me.

177
00:08:41,847 --> 00:08:42,847
Is that so?

178
00:08:47,617 --> 00:08:49,918
- Are you in here, Se Seung? - Yes. What is it?

179
00:08:50,347 --> 00:08:52,987
I was wondering if you wanted to talk.

180
00:08:53,217 --> 00:08:55,018
- Sure. Come on in. - Okay.

181
00:08:58,058 --> 00:08:59,827
What happened?

182
00:09:00,398 --> 00:09:02,096
I have no idea.

183
00:09:02,097 --> 00:09:05,798
Did this happen after today's date?

184
00:09:05,967 --> 00:09:07,097
Right.

185
00:09:07,438 --> 00:09:09,667
You're his brother.

186
00:09:09,668 --> 00:09:13,606
So you might think similarly. That's why I want to ask you this.

187
00:09:13,607 --> 00:09:15,206
Did you also not consider...

188
00:09:15,207 --> 00:09:16,808
what would come after the final decision?

189
00:09:17,207 --> 00:09:18,278
I did.

190
00:09:18,548 --> 00:09:21,277
Don't you think that's an obvious step?

191
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:22,587
It's something we ought to think about.

192
00:09:22,747 --> 00:09:25,258
Jung Sub didn't do that.

193
00:09:25,587 --> 00:09:28,586
He thought that the final decision...

194
00:09:28,587 --> 00:09:31,456
meant a summary of his feelings...

195
00:09:31,457 --> 00:09:33,398
for the past three weeks.

196
00:09:34,028 --> 00:09:36,297
I had been thinking about what would happen...

197
00:09:36,298 --> 00:09:40,267
after the final decision for quite some time.

198
00:09:40,268 --> 00:09:42,837
I was worried and so on.

199
00:09:44,038 --> 00:09:45,278
I think there's a misunderstanding.

200
00:09:45,607 --> 00:09:47,077
That's not what he said.

201
00:09:47,207 --> 00:09:48,576
- That's what he said. - Right now,

202
00:09:48,577 --> 00:09:51,077
he was thinking the same thing with you.

203
00:09:51,408 --> 00:09:53,877
Now, yes. Because it's after we talked about this.

204
00:09:53,878 --> 00:09:56,587
I think you guys had a weird way of communicating.

205
00:09:56,747 --> 00:09:59,217
I think you two misunderstood one another.

206
00:09:59,317 --> 00:10:02,387
But he didn't put it like that when we talked.

207
00:10:02,388 --> 00:10:04,787
- Do you know what he said? - He's like that.

208
00:10:04,788 --> 00:10:07,297
"So you're even thinking about our future."

209
00:10:07,298 --> 00:10:09,227
He made it sound like it was too much.

210
00:10:09,827 --> 00:10:11,097
Gosh. Seriously.

211
00:10:14,497 --> 00:10:17,138
Se Seung told me something completely different.

212
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:19,836
She said Jung Sub didn't think at all about...

213
00:10:19,837 --> 00:10:21,377
what would happen after the final decision.

214
00:10:21,378 --> 00:10:25,206
Then I thought there was a major misunderstanding between them.

215
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:28,717
I thought, "Jung Sub must have said something completely weird."

216
00:10:28,918 --> 00:10:30,918
No. Se Seung. Wait.

217
00:10:31,817 --> 00:10:33,757
This is miscommunication.

218
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:36,027
- How is this miscommunication? - I...

219
00:10:36,028 --> 00:10:38,257
I got goosebumps when you told me what happened.

220
00:10:38,258 --> 00:10:40,996
There's only so much you can miscommunicate with.

221
00:10:40,997 --> 00:10:43,466
He told me something completely different.

222
00:10:43,467 --> 00:10:45,837
Here's what Jung Sub meant.

223
00:10:46,038 --> 00:10:49,137
I know him well. So what I'm about to tell you is true.

224
00:10:49,138 --> 00:10:51,767
Jung Sub is very happy with you.

225
00:10:51,768 --> 00:10:54,836
So his feelings are deepening gradually.

226
00:10:54,837 --> 00:10:57,877
So even after the shoot, he wants to get to know you...

227
00:10:57,878 --> 00:11:01,247
little by little and see if things can work out between you two.

228
00:11:01,447 --> 00:11:03,787
Let's say that's what he was thinking all along.

229
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:05,246
Then when I asked him...

230
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:06,716
if he thought about what would come after final decision,

231
00:11:06,717 --> 00:11:08,457
he should have said yes.

232
00:11:08,587 --> 00:11:09,888
He was thinking about that.

233
00:11:10,058 --> 00:11:12,726
- He would have unless he's a fool. - But why today...

234
00:11:12,727 --> 00:11:15,227
What on earth did you two talk about?

235
00:11:15,367 --> 00:11:18,466
Yun Ha. You need to watch the video to objectively evaluate.

236
00:11:18,467 --> 00:11:19,638
This isn't fair.

237
00:11:20,237 --> 00:11:23,836
Here's what Jung Sub understood from what you said.

238
00:11:23,837 --> 00:11:26,836
He thought you wanted to start a relationship after this.

239
00:11:26,837 --> 00:11:28,907
- But... - But he didn't want that.

240
00:11:28,908 --> 00:11:32,178
He wanted to get to know you more and then start a relationship.

241
00:11:32,247 --> 00:11:33,446
Of course, I had to get to know him more.

242
00:11:33,447 --> 00:11:35,647
How could I date him right away?

243
00:11:35,648 --> 00:11:37,287
- Here's what I exactly said. - Yes.

244
00:11:37,288 --> 00:11:39,687
"Did you think about what would come after the final decision?"

245
00:11:39,688 --> 00:11:41,187
That's what I asked. How could he understand that as...

246
00:11:41,188 --> 00:11:44,827
"Will we start a relationship right after the final decision?"

247
00:11:44,987 --> 00:11:47,657
Let's say he did somehow understand it like that.

248
00:11:47,658 --> 00:11:49,267
Then he should have said,

249
00:11:49,268 --> 00:11:50,797
"I thought about what would happen after this,"

250
00:11:50,798 --> 00:11:52,297
"but I want to get to know you more."

251
00:11:52,298 --> 00:11:53,366
He should have said that.

252
00:11:53,367 --> 00:11:55,908
- Right. But he didn't say that? - But he didn't say that.

253
00:11:56,268 --> 00:11:58,807
Recently, I tried really hard...

254
00:11:58,808 --> 00:12:01,378
- to understand Jung Sub... - Yes.

255
00:12:01,577 --> 00:12:03,148
- for who he was. - Yes.

256
00:12:03,308 --> 00:12:05,647
Because I liked him a lot,

257
00:12:05,648 --> 00:12:08,716
I decided to accept my feelings for him.

258
00:12:08,717 --> 00:12:10,216
I was fine if my feelings were bigger than his.

259
00:12:10,217 --> 00:12:14,086
I concluded that it didn't matter even if I liked him first.

260
00:12:14,087 --> 00:12:16,356
Even when I reflected on myself for him,

261
00:12:16,357 --> 00:12:18,628
he didn't think about what would come after the show.

262
00:12:18,898 --> 00:12:21,797
But why did he put it like that when you guys talked?

263
00:12:21,798 --> 00:12:24,528
We talked about this the whole ride here.

264
00:12:25,128 --> 00:12:28,496
"What do I do? I was going to choose Se Seung."

265
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:30,466
"Why won't she even look at me?"

266
00:12:30,467 --> 00:12:32,976
He's been telling me that the whole time.

267
00:12:32,977 --> 00:12:37,777
By the way, when we talked during the secret date, what...

268
00:12:37,778 --> 00:12:39,747
- did he remember... - He didn't talk about this at all.

269
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:44,288
So Jung Sub completely misunderstood everything.

270
00:12:44,447 --> 00:12:46,586
- Jung Sub has a problem. - How is this possible?

271
00:12:46,587 --> 00:12:49,357
This conversation... Can someone misunderstand it this badly?

272
00:12:49,428 --> 00:12:51,558
In my opinion, it is possible for Jung Sub.

273
00:12:51,827 --> 00:12:55,566
He and I had a lot of misunderstandings so far.

274
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:59,167
I kept trying to find the cause within myself.

275
00:12:59,168 --> 00:13:00,496
But I'm starting to think that...

276
00:13:00,497 --> 00:13:01,866
Jung Sub must have played some part in them.

277
00:13:01,867 --> 00:13:04,167
Let me apologize since he's my brother.

278
00:13:04,168 --> 00:13:06,477
What on earth is his problem?

279
00:13:06,908 --> 00:13:10,407
He might not have understood what you meant then.

280
00:13:10,408 --> 00:13:12,116
- I don't know how... - Like you weren't on the same...

281
00:13:12,117 --> 00:13:13,846
I'm going to work this out with him.

282
00:13:13,847 --> 00:13:15,278
I might end up fighting with him.

283
00:13:15,487 --> 00:13:17,117
We should have a three-party talk.

284
00:13:17,388 --> 00:13:20,787
She told me something completely different from what I was thinking.

285
00:13:20,788 --> 00:13:22,456
Gosh. Seriously. When I heard that,

286
00:13:22,457 --> 00:13:24,086
I was just shocked.

287
00:13:24,087 --> 00:13:25,726
I couldn't believe what I was hearing.

288
00:13:25,727 --> 00:13:28,027
This wasn't the only thing that happened.

289
00:13:28,028 --> 00:13:32,028
Yong Woo asked to see me for the secret date.

290
00:13:32,798 --> 00:13:34,537
He told me that...

291
00:13:34,538 --> 00:13:38,566
he was no longer interested in Cho A and was interested in someone else.

292
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,677
He never said who it was.

293
00:13:40,678 --> 00:13:42,446
- Then he wanted a date with me. - Okay.

294
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:45,346
Then what would I think? I naturally thought he meant me.

295
00:13:45,347 --> 00:13:49,586
That's why I had misunderstood him until the Truth or Dare.

296
00:13:49,587 --> 00:13:51,548
Then he asked questions to Ji Won.

297
00:13:53,388 --> 00:13:54,887
Wait. Are you guys done?

298
00:13:54,888 --> 00:13:56,357
- You can come in. - Get out.

299
00:13:57,388 --> 00:14:00,397
My feelings got hurt for no reason. Why did I go through that?

300
00:14:00,398 --> 00:14:02,566
Your feelings will get hurt if you let that hurt your feelings.

301
00:14:02,567 --> 00:14:03,797
If you don't let it, it won't hurt your feelings.

302
00:14:03,798 --> 00:14:05,967
- Can anyone heal my wounds? - My wounds?

303
00:14:06,038 --> 00:14:07,496
Anyway, it's up to...

304
00:14:07,497 --> 00:14:08,937
- what you make it out to be. - I was...

305
00:14:08,938 --> 00:14:10,537
- really surprised. - Don't let that hurt you.

306
00:14:10,538 --> 00:14:12,337
Will you choose Jung Sub tomorrow?

307
00:14:12,737 --> 00:14:15,038
I just talked to Yun Ha.

308
00:14:15,237 --> 00:14:17,347
- How will I explain it to him? - It was not a big deal.

309
00:14:17,548 --> 00:14:20,378
Jung Sub didn't tell me everything she just said.

310
00:14:20,878 --> 00:14:23,617
Well, you should try to talk it out.

311
00:14:23,747 --> 00:14:25,446
How am I going to talk it out?

312
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:27,457
It will be difficult. There should be a mediator.

313
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:28,816
- With you? - Yes.

314
00:14:28,817 --> 00:14:30,128
Then you have my support.

315
00:14:30,558 --> 00:14:34,157
Gosh. If she helps out his brother come out of this disaster,

316
00:14:34,158 --> 00:14:36,067
- they might end up together. - Right.

317
00:14:36,327 --> 00:14:37,668
Gosh. Anything can happen.

318
00:14:38,668 --> 00:14:40,097
Then what about me?

319
00:14:40,138 --> 00:14:43,007
I think you're doing a good job.

320
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:44,606
I had never intended this to happen.

321
00:14:44,607 --> 00:14:46,138
Not even for a moment.

322
00:14:46,378 --> 00:14:49,677
In my opinion, if you have been honest so far,

323
00:14:49,678 --> 00:14:54,317
there's no need to justify anything.

324
00:14:54,447 --> 00:14:56,446
Why is it so cold down here?

325
00:14:56,447 --> 00:14:57,717
I thought you were sleeping.

326
00:14:57,888 --> 00:14:59,457
She wasn't. She was talking to Jae Hyung.

327
00:14:59,587 --> 00:15:00,918
I see. Jae Hyung.

328
00:15:02,788 --> 00:15:05,188
- It's so cold. - Anyway, that happened.

329
00:15:07,097 --> 00:15:09,528
Ji Won. Do you want to talk later?

330
00:15:10,097 --> 00:15:11,128
Where will you be?

331
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,736
- Me? Later. - You should talk now.

332
00:15:13,737 --> 00:15:14,967
I'll go to you later.

333
00:15:15,038 --> 00:15:16,167
You should go and talk.

334
00:15:16,168 --> 00:15:17,967
- We'll go out for a cigarette. - Gosh.

335
00:15:18,567 --> 00:15:19,837
You don't have much time left now.

336
00:15:25,107 --> 00:15:27,178
- Are you coming? - Yes. I'm going to you.

337
00:15:28,117 --> 00:15:29,548
You're wearing yellow slippers.

338
00:15:29,987 --> 00:15:32,457
Yes. Like chicks.

339
00:15:32,688 --> 00:15:35,826
Well, I didn't come here to have a serious conversation.

340
00:15:35,827 --> 00:15:38,727
I'm just here to check up on you.

341
00:15:39,197 --> 00:15:41,956
I felt bad to Jae Hyung...

342
00:15:41,957 --> 00:15:44,167
because Ju Yeon... This is interesting, isn't it?

343
00:15:44,168 --> 00:15:48,438
When he expressed his interest in you with his answers today,

344
00:15:48,638 --> 00:15:51,837
- Ju Yeon was hurt by that again. - Right.

345
00:15:52,107 --> 00:15:54,637
Anyway, it's interesting how everything panned out.

346
00:15:54,638 --> 00:15:55,877
It's fascinating. But...

347
00:15:55,878 --> 00:15:57,577
Do you have the remote control for the air conditioner?

348
00:15:57,878 --> 00:15:59,018
It's Jae Hyung.

349
00:16:00,317 --> 00:16:01,577
- The air conditioner... - Gosh, the timing...

350
00:16:01,747 --> 00:16:03,647
He shouldn't worry about turning off the air conditioner.

351
00:16:03,648 --> 00:16:04,918
Did he see them together? He can, right?

352
00:16:06,418 --> 00:16:08,087
Do you have the remote control for the air conditioner?

353
00:16:08,857 --> 00:16:11,087
- The remote control? - I think I brought it here earlier.

354
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:13,628
Wait. It's right here.

355
00:16:26,337 --> 00:16:28,337
To be honest,

356
00:16:29,607 --> 00:16:32,548
when I sent the text message,

357
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,717
I sort of made my decision.

358
00:16:35,418 --> 00:16:36,518
I'm at ease now.

359
00:16:37,947 --> 00:16:39,956
I said that I was leaning...

360
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,957
toward a different direction from "None."

361
00:16:42,487 --> 00:16:44,757
When I said that, this crossed my mind.

362
00:16:44,758 --> 00:16:47,158
"I'm not just leaning toward her."

363
00:16:47,898 --> 00:16:49,768
"I practically already made my decision."

364
00:16:50,298 --> 00:16:51,428
That's what I thought.

365
00:16:59,507 --> 00:17:00,908
- Should we get some sleep now? - Yes.

366
00:17:01,338 --> 00:17:03,747
- Sleep tight. See you tomorrow. - See you tomorrow.

367
00:17:20,697 --> 00:17:23,027
Gosh. I'm feeling so vulnerable right now.

368
00:17:25,168 --> 00:17:27,668
(He stops in front of Se Seung's room for a moment.)

369
00:17:28,398 --> 00:17:29,668
(Sighing)

370
00:17:32,237 --> 00:17:33,908
(He goes back to Se Seung's room.)

371
00:17:35,178 --> 00:17:36,378
(Backing away)

372
00:17:39,007 --> 00:17:41,117
- No. - No. Go!

373
00:17:41,118 --> 00:17:42,177
- Go straight. - Let's go, Jung Sub.

374
00:17:42,178 --> 00:17:43,547
Open the door and go in with the moonwalk.

375
00:17:45,217 --> 00:17:47,358
(He musters up his courage and tries again.)

376
00:17:50,328 --> 00:17:51,557
(Knocking)

377
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:53,057
Yes.

378
00:17:55,328 --> 00:17:56,466
May I come in?

379
00:17:56,467 --> 00:17:58,227
Sure. Did you drink?

380
00:17:58,467 --> 00:17:59,598
I had a can of beer.

381
00:18:00,598 --> 00:18:02,237
You. Come here right now.

382
00:18:02,638 --> 00:18:05,207
- What on earth did you say to her? - What?

383
00:18:05,568 --> 00:18:07,236
Why did you tell her...

384
00:18:07,237 --> 00:18:09,946
you didn't think about what would come after this?

385
00:18:09,947 --> 00:18:11,848
Why did you say that to Se Seung?

386
00:18:12,517 --> 00:18:14,217
(Utterly serious)

387
00:18:14,747 --> 00:18:16,317
The plan I thought about after the show...

388
00:18:16,318 --> 00:18:17,848
was a lot more concrete.

389
00:18:18,588 --> 00:18:19,588
(Glancing)

390
00:18:19,589 --> 00:18:21,587
(Yun Ha: Responding, Jae Hyung: Sharply inhaling)

391
00:18:21,588 --> 00:18:24,256
By "more concrete," did you mean that...

392
00:18:24,257 --> 00:18:26,928
- you were more serious about it? - Yes.

393
00:18:27,358 --> 00:18:30,197
So you had more things to think about, right?

394
00:18:30,267 --> 00:18:31,328
Right.

395
00:18:31,398 --> 00:18:32,938
When we were talking about that...

396
00:18:35,868 --> 00:18:37,638
- Why do I think he's cute? Gosh. - What's this?

397
00:18:37,737 --> 00:18:39,507
- It's like he's getting scolded. - This is so funny.

398
00:18:39,608 --> 00:18:41,678
He's facing Judge Se Seung.

399
00:18:41,908 --> 00:18:43,306
When we were talking about that...

400
00:18:43,307 --> 00:18:45,578
(Making his case in front of the judge)

401
00:18:47,118 --> 00:18:50,148
I realized that I didn't express my intention correctly.

402
00:18:52,957 --> 00:18:54,987
(His statement stirs up the jury.)

403
00:18:55,088 --> 00:18:57,027
But he's cute.

404
00:18:58,658 --> 00:19:01,227
I was quite surprised.

405
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,196
Seriously. He couldn't even look at me.

406
00:19:03,197 --> 00:19:05,167
He kept glancing at Yun Ha.

407
00:19:05,168 --> 00:19:08,537
It was like a kid getting scolded. His face got so red.

408
00:19:08,838 --> 00:19:10,467
Gosh. I thought, "He's so cute."

409
00:19:11,338 --> 00:19:12,368
"What's up with him?"

410
00:19:13,037 --> 00:19:15,438
I really thought about this in a detailed manner.

411
00:19:16,007 --> 00:19:17,348
I thought, "After the shoot,"

412
00:19:18,047 --> 00:19:19,276
"where will we meet?"

413
00:19:19,277 --> 00:19:22,216
The research schedule is very fluid.

414
00:19:22,217 --> 00:19:24,118
So I wondered if she could be flexible with that.

415
00:19:24,217 --> 00:19:27,087
There were so many things I wanted to ask her.

416
00:19:27,088 --> 00:19:29,358
Let me explain why I asked you about your job situation.

417
00:19:29,457 --> 00:19:31,657
When we go back to Korea,

418
00:19:31,658 --> 00:19:33,726
you will have some time to spare.

419
00:19:33,727 --> 00:19:36,168
Compared to me, making this decision will be easier...

420
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:38,167
Well, not decision, per se.

421
00:19:38,168 --> 00:19:40,697
I'm trying my best to be careful when choosing my words now.

422
00:19:41,237 --> 00:19:42,296
That's why compared to me,

423
00:19:42,297 --> 00:19:44,567
it was easier for you to make that decision.

424
00:19:44,568 --> 00:19:46,036
Let's say you were thinking about that.

425
00:19:46,037 --> 00:19:48,377
Then when I asked you...

426
00:19:48,378 --> 00:19:49,807
if you thought about what would come after the shoot,

427
00:19:49,977 --> 00:19:51,848
you should have said, "Yes." Don't you agree?

428
00:19:52,578 --> 00:19:55,017
But you told me, "No."

429
00:19:55,348 --> 00:19:56,387
- That was... - You told me...

430
00:19:56,388 --> 00:19:57,388
you didn't think about it.

431
00:19:57,389 --> 00:19:59,618
When we were talking about that,

432
00:20:00,017 --> 00:20:02,956
I was trying to figure out the schedule.

433
00:20:02,957 --> 00:20:04,486
On top of everything...

434
00:20:04,487 --> 00:20:07,057
Okay. I see. I get what he was trying to say.

435
00:20:07,197 --> 00:20:09,196
So this is what he must have meant.

436
00:20:09,197 --> 00:20:10,966
He didn't know how to spare time.

437
00:20:10,967 --> 00:20:12,898
He didn't have a concrete plan for that.

438
00:20:13,398 --> 00:20:15,236
That's why he wanted to know about her next job.

439
00:20:15,237 --> 00:20:16,736
- He meant he didn't have a plan. - Right.

440
00:20:16,737 --> 00:20:18,236
- He knew he was going on a trip. - He didn't have a plan.

441
00:20:18,237 --> 00:20:20,377
"I got a plane ticket for this date. So I'm going on a trip."

442
00:20:20,378 --> 00:20:22,407
"But I didn't book the hotel yet." It's similar to that.

443
00:20:22,408 --> 00:20:24,847
- Right. - That's why he said, "physically."

444
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:26,976
- She was speaking in Korean. - I get it.

445
00:20:26,977 --> 00:20:28,717
- They can't communicate at all. - Why couldn't he understand her?

446
00:20:29,318 --> 00:20:31,987
Given what happened, we should say they're not compatible.

447
00:20:32,247 --> 00:20:33,986
- But they like each other. - I see.

448
00:20:33,987 --> 00:20:35,388
Is that what you think, Professor?

449
00:20:35,688 --> 00:20:37,226
- Is that what you think, Professor? - This is...

450
00:20:37,227 --> 00:20:38,726
a huge problem.

451
00:20:38,727 --> 00:20:41,428
I saw you scratch your eyes earlier through the glasses.

452
00:20:43,128 --> 00:20:45,067
- That's nice. - That's a secret.

453
00:20:45,068 --> 00:20:46,967
- That's a secret? - The glasses don't have any lenses?

454
00:20:47,098 --> 00:20:48,098
- That was... - You told me...

455
00:20:48,099 --> 00:20:49,137
you didn't think about it.

456
00:20:49,138 --> 00:20:51,408
When we were talking about that,

457
00:20:51,838 --> 00:20:54,776
I was trying to figure out the schedule.

458
00:20:54,777 --> 00:20:56,206
On top of everything, I didn't know...

459
00:20:56,207 --> 00:20:58,907
- how I was going to date you. - He focused on the present.

460
00:20:58,908 --> 00:21:00,046
I was totally focused.

461
00:21:00,047 --> 00:21:01,776
There were so many things to consider,

462
00:21:01,777 --> 00:21:03,918
so I couldn't start thinking about them for a while.

463
00:21:04,088 --> 00:21:06,818
But I said I didn't think about that when I answered that.

464
00:21:07,918 --> 00:21:10,088
See? This is how he is, Se Seung.

465
00:21:10,888 --> 00:21:15,127
I realized what made Se Seung misunderstand what I said.

466
00:21:15,128 --> 00:21:19,497
Because I didn't explain it clearly, I hurt her feelings.

467
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:22,607
Of course, I had a hard time with this misunderstanding.

468
00:21:22,608 --> 00:21:25,537
But I realized it must've been tough on her just as much.

469
00:21:25,807 --> 00:21:27,736
- Most of the time, - You get him now, right?

470
00:21:27,737 --> 00:21:29,207
When I talk to other people,

471
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:33,117
I have to say things in more detail.

472
00:21:33,118 --> 00:21:35,917
Then I can get my sincere thoughts across...

473
00:21:35,918 --> 00:21:37,547
in a refined manner.

474
00:21:37,688 --> 00:21:39,517
But when I try to talk about something...

475
00:21:39,688 --> 00:21:42,457
- Yes. Right. I'm like that too. - without preparing myself,

476
00:21:42,557 --> 00:21:44,927
there are times I end up...

477
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:45,997
- Right. - expressing them incorrectly.

478
00:21:46,497 --> 00:21:48,196
This happens to you when you stare at the computer...

479
00:21:48,197 --> 00:21:49,226
- all day long. - I usually...

480
00:21:49,227 --> 00:21:51,367
spend all day talking to computers.

481
00:21:51,368 --> 00:21:53,598
That's my day-to-day life.

482
00:21:53,967 --> 00:21:56,107
So there are times I fail to think...

483
00:21:56,108 --> 00:21:58,108
about the most important thing.

484
00:21:58,737 --> 00:22:00,777
There are times I fail to express it correctly.

485
00:22:01,707 --> 00:22:03,007
He's so cute.

486
00:22:03,378 --> 00:22:05,806
He was so scared.

487
00:22:05,807 --> 00:22:08,216
When I saw him like that,

488
00:22:08,217 --> 00:22:11,317
I realized how innocent he was...

489
00:22:11,318 --> 00:22:12,388
although he may be a fool.

490
00:22:12,588 --> 00:22:14,387
When I discover an innocent side of someone,

491
00:22:14,388 --> 00:22:16,557
it helps me open up to become more serious.

492
00:22:16,858 --> 00:22:19,428
I thought it was okay to open up to him.

493
00:22:19,628 --> 00:22:21,128
You had a serious misunderstanding.

494
00:22:21,997 --> 00:22:23,168
Actually,

495
00:22:23,328 --> 00:22:24,667
I was quite tired at that point.

496
00:22:24,668 --> 00:22:26,837
They could have just worked it out on their own.

497
00:22:26,838 --> 00:22:28,398
It was like watching them play house.

498
00:22:29,168 --> 00:22:31,206
He came over to our room and wanted to talk to her.

499
00:22:31,207 --> 00:22:32,777
He comforted Se Seung.

500
00:22:32,878 --> 00:22:34,637
From his action,

501
00:22:34,638 --> 00:22:38,078
I could see that he was innocent and sincere.

502
00:22:39,818 --> 00:22:40,848
I'm sorry.

503
00:22:41,618 --> 00:22:43,918
- Gosh, so cute... - This is a relief, though.

504
00:22:45,148 --> 00:22:46,456
- I'm sorry I caused... - I got the chills.

505
00:22:46,457 --> 00:22:47,717
This misunderstanding.

506
00:22:47,858 --> 00:22:50,388
I'm so glad I talked to you first.

507
00:22:50,457 --> 00:22:52,827
You're his interpreter.

508
00:22:52,828 --> 00:22:53,858
Right.

509
00:22:54,027 --> 00:22:56,627
I don't listen to everything he says.

510
00:22:56,628 --> 00:22:58,898
I just communicate with him through my heart.

511
00:22:59,598 --> 00:23:02,767
There's something lacking when he communicates verbally.

512
00:23:02,938 --> 00:23:04,438
I don't think he can fix it.

513
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:06,578
Maybe, he has to change his job first.

514
00:23:06,777 --> 00:23:09,237
I was really glad that my sister was there.

515
00:23:09,777 --> 00:23:11,908
She could only help me because she was my sister.

516
00:23:12,277 --> 00:23:13,516
This was only possible...

517
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:14,716
- on our show. - Totally.

518
00:23:14,717 --> 00:23:17,348
- He should give her a present. - Totally.

519
00:23:17,418 --> 00:23:19,487
They made up a lot more easily than we thought.

520
00:23:19,517 --> 00:23:21,256
- Right. I thought... - I knew...

521
00:23:21,257 --> 00:23:22,786
- it was over for them. - I knew they would make up.

522
00:23:22,787 --> 00:23:25,457
- I knew they would make up. - I thought...

523
00:23:25,757 --> 00:23:27,957
Let's go, Jung Sub. I need to smack you.

524
00:23:29,727 --> 00:23:30,727
I'm sorry.

525
00:23:32,068 --> 00:23:34,398
Seriously. I need to smack you several times.

526
00:23:34,568 --> 00:23:37,168
I'm sorry. I can't look you in the eye.

527
00:23:50,148 --> 00:23:51,787
I just thought...

528
00:23:52,618 --> 00:23:55,358
we needed time to adjust...

529
00:23:55,557 --> 00:23:58,158
because of the schedule I mentioned earlier.

530
00:23:58,457 --> 00:24:02,196
So you thought I wanted to date you without having an adjusting period.

531
00:24:02,197 --> 00:24:03,496
- That's what you thought. - I thought that's what you meant.

532
00:24:03,497 --> 00:24:06,196
Actually, we never talked about our future...

533
00:24:06,197 --> 00:24:08,637
- when we talked so much. - Right.

534
00:24:08,638 --> 00:24:11,306
How could you reach a conclusion I wanted to date you right away?

535
00:24:11,307 --> 00:24:14,877
- How could you think that? - That's...

536
00:24:14,878 --> 00:24:16,306
That's how it looked to me.

537
00:24:16,307 --> 00:24:18,347
- Did it look like... - Seriously.

538
00:24:18,348 --> 00:24:20,746
I couldn't wait to get my hands on you?

539
00:24:20,747 --> 00:24:22,217
Well, it was possible.

540
00:24:25,287 --> 00:24:26,658
- I'll kill you. - It was possible.

541
00:24:28,358 --> 00:24:29,928
Do I make you uncomfortable?

542
00:24:30,158 --> 00:24:31,427
- No. - My feelings for you?

543
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:32,687
No, that's not the case at all.

544
00:24:32,688 --> 00:24:34,997
Then how could you think I wanted to date you right away?

545
00:24:35,727 --> 00:24:37,297
I'm sorry. I just thought...

546
00:24:38,027 --> 00:24:39,127
Then you should have said...

547
00:24:39,128 --> 00:24:41,036
- "I have a lot on my mind too." - I thought...

548
00:24:41,037 --> 00:24:42,806
You should have said "I have a lot on my mind too."

549
00:24:42,807 --> 00:24:46,068
You had a lot on your mind, so you already made up your mind.

550
00:24:53,217 --> 00:24:54,217
Thank you.

551
00:24:55,378 --> 00:24:58,888
I had another reason to say that. I thought that we had built...

552
00:24:59,217 --> 00:25:01,387
- somewhat of trust between us. - Yes.

553
00:25:01,388 --> 00:25:03,487
- I agree. - So I thought we could have...

554
00:25:03,888 --> 00:25:07,697
this level of conversation with the trust...

555
00:25:08,027 --> 00:25:10,098
we had built so far.

556
00:25:12,398 --> 00:25:15,568
- I get what you're saying. Yes. - You do? Really?

557
00:25:15,967 --> 00:25:19,037
I can understand why you could have thought so.

558
00:25:19,467 --> 00:25:22,276
But here's a thing. When people talk to you,

559
00:25:22,277 --> 00:25:23,907
you also need to understand...

560
00:25:23,908 --> 00:25:25,577
the literal meaning of what they say.

561
00:25:25,578 --> 00:25:29,148
Right. I have a hard time doing that.

562
00:25:39,358 --> 00:25:40,398
Are you cold?

563
00:25:47,898 --> 00:25:49,338
I'll let this slide because you're cute.

564
00:25:50,068 --> 00:25:51,838
I'm sorry. You must have been stressed out a lot.

565
00:25:52,237 --> 00:25:54,277
- But... - Today has been a tough day for me.

566
00:25:55,108 --> 00:25:56,378
Today has been tough for me too.

567
00:25:57,078 --> 00:25:58,707
- It was tougher for me. - I...

568
00:25:58,878 --> 00:26:01,178
I really like Jung Sub.

569
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:05,017
He's so cute.

570
00:26:06,287 --> 00:26:07,918
How could he be this cute?

571
00:26:09,987 --> 00:26:11,987
The conclusion doesn't seem to change.

572
00:26:12,428 --> 00:26:15,928
I'll end up liking him. Why do we fight?

573
00:26:17,027 --> 00:26:19,068
- Hi. - Ju Yeon.

574
00:26:19,398 --> 00:26:20,536
Where have you been?

575
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:21,696
I thought you were sleeping.

576
00:26:21,697 --> 00:26:23,408
We went to a wedding hall or something.

577
00:26:23,668 --> 00:26:25,407
- Did you already make a vow? - We went to a wedding hall.

578
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:27,138
- We almost broke it off. - We almost ended it.

579
00:26:27,537 --> 00:26:29,408
It's not the picture I had in mind of you guys.

580
00:26:29,578 --> 00:26:30,908
The vibe between you two...

581
00:26:31,608 --> 00:26:33,817
- What's going on? - Whose fault is that, Jung Sub?

582
00:26:33,818 --> 00:26:34,917
It's my fault.

583
00:26:34,918 --> 00:26:35,918
By the way,

584
00:26:37,818 --> 00:26:41,487
- I didn't feel good today. - Right. I can understand that.

585
00:26:41,818 --> 00:26:44,287
- I heard you cried earlier. - Yes.

586
00:26:45,257 --> 00:26:47,128
Before the show,

587
00:26:47,828 --> 00:26:50,496
I often heard what Jae Hyung said from the guy...

588
00:26:50,497 --> 00:26:51,997
I had feelings for.

589
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:54,168
"I'm not attracted to you romantically."

590
00:26:54,338 --> 00:26:55,967
It made me think,

591
00:26:56,438 --> 00:26:58,807
"Is it impossible for guys to be attracted to me?"

592
00:26:59,237 --> 00:27:01,378
I don't think that's not true at all.

593
00:27:02,277 --> 00:27:05,108
If you start thinking that's who you are,

594
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:07,078
that doubt will never end.

595
00:27:08,148 --> 00:27:10,517
You need to break out of that.

596
00:27:10,648 --> 00:27:14,188
And you asked him about your unattractive quality earlier.

597
00:27:14,318 --> 00:27:15,887
That question must have been so hurtful...

598
00:27:15,888 --> 00:27:17,427
- to you. - Right.

599
00:27:17,428 --> 00:27:19,828
(A while ago during the Truth or Dare)

600
00:27:20,398 --> 00:27:21,398
(Your unattractive quality?)

601
00:27:22,497 --> 00:27:25,928
(Ju Yeon asked Jae Hyung about her unattractive quality.)

602
00:27:26,697 --> 00:27:30,108
How come guys I like aren't romantically attracted to me?

603
00:27:30,807 --> 00:27:33,678
That had been my problem my whole life.

604
00:27:33,908 --> 00:27:35,477
To be honest, I blamed myself a lot.

605
00:27:35,638 --> 00:27:38,078
I kept trying to look for reasons why they didn't like me.

606
00:27:38,148 --> 00:27:40,317
(There are no unattractive qualities about you.)

607
00:27:40,318 --> 00:27:42,717
(This didn't happen because you were unattractive.)

608
00:27:46,318 --> 00:27:48,318
Why did Ju Yeon...

609
00:27:49,688 --> 00:27:52,328
Gosh. Why would Ju Yeon ask that?

610
00:27:53,027 --> 00:27:55,796
Why did she think so less of herself?

611
00:27:55,797 --> 00:27:58,098
You know, it was heartbreaking.

612
00:27:58,467 --> 00:27:59,496
How...

613
00:27:59,497 --> 00:28:03,207
She must have been so miserable to ask that kind of question.

614
00:28:06,007 --> 00:28:07,777
That was heartbreaking.

615
00:28:09,307 --> 00:28:11,547
I don't want her to do that to herself.

616
00:28:14,447 --> 00:28:16,986
I didn't understand why you would ask a question...

617
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:18,716
that would make you feel so small.

618
00:28:18,717 --> 00:28:22,757
- That broke my heart. - I had the same thought.

619
00:28:22,918 --> 00:28:26,628
When you asked that, I didn't know where to look.

620
00:28:26,898 --> 00:28:28,897
You don't have any unattractive qualities.

621
00:28:28,898 --> 00:28:30,567
Trying to find good qualities about ourselves...

622
00:28:30,568 --> 00:28:33,237
- is enough to take up our time. - Right.

623
00:28:33,967 --> 00:28:35,296
Why would you look for...

624
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:36,667
- unattractive qualities? - Right.

625
00:28:36,668 --> 00:28:38,908
Don't look for your unattractive qualities.

626
00:28:40,037 --> 00:28:42,007
- That way, I can improve. - Why...

627
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:44,747
It can help at times.

628
00:28:45,378 --> 00:28:47,277
But if you focus more on that...

629
00:28:47,848 --> 00:28:50,016
especially in situations like this, it will be...

630
00:28:50,017 --> 00:28:52,717
- Right. Seriously. - harder on you.

631
00:28:53,557 --> 00:28:56,526
The thoughts you have...

632
00:28:56,527 --> 00:28:57,688
- They're sound. - are sound...

633
00:28:58,188 --> 00:29:00,428
and admirable.

634
00:29:00,527 --> 00:29:02,196
- Right. - But you must...

635
00:29:02,197 --> 00:29:03,868
- believe in them yourself. - Yes.

636
00:29:04,267 --> 00:29:06,438
Wait. This sort of looks weird.

637
00:29:07,098 --> 00:29:08,197
"Do you believe?"

638
00:29:09,368 --> 00:29:10,767
But you really need that.

639
00:29:11,368 --> 00:29:13,537
Thank you for saying that.

640
00:29:15,007 --> 00:29:17,807
(Ji Won is having trouble going to sleep.)

641
00:30:22,707 --> 00:30:25,877
The biggest reason why I was so torn...

642
00:30:25,878 --> 00:30:28,147
was time.

643
00:30:28,148 --> 00:30:32,087
I had the most fun with Jae Hyung.

644
00:30:32,088 --> 00:30:35,117
But after our first date, Yong Woo and I...

645
00:30:35,118 --> 00:30:37,927
rarely spent time in private.

646
00:30:37,928 --> 00:30:40,757
So I had a lot on my mind.

647
00:30:51,507 --> 00:30:55,507
(The day of the final decision)

648
00:31:02,047 --> 00:31:05,047
It's the grand finale. We should look nice.

649
00:31:05,918 --> 00:31:08,557
I suddenly feel the weight of my decision.

650
00:31:10,828 --> 00:31:12,957
The weight of my decision is hitting me.

651
00:31:13,257 --> 00:31:14,727
It's fascinating and funny.

652
00:31:15,898 --> 00:31:17,267
Ji Won. Does my hair look okay?

653
00:31:17,697 --> 00:31:19,868
Let me fix this curly part.

654
00:31:21,098 --> 00:31:23,097
Did you talk to Ji Won last night?

655
00:31:23,098 --> 00:31:24,267
- Yes. - I see.

656
00:31:24,707 --> 00:31:27,737
What do you think? Do you think she'll change her mind?

657
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:31,247
I'll leave it up to fate.

658
00:31:32,207 --> 00:31:33,648
Do you feel better?

659
00:31:34,217 --> 00:31:35,517
You feel better after getting some sleep, right?

660
00:31:35,578 --> 00:31:36,848
Yes. I feel better than yesterday.

661
00:31:47,628 --> 00:31:49,158
- Ju Yeon. - Yes.

662
00:31:49,227 --> 00:31:51,398
Could you come over to my room for a second?

663
00:31:51,727 --> 00:31:53,438
Do you need to talk? Okay.

664
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:56,567
You asked me that question yesterday.

665
00:31:56,568 --> 00:31:57,608
Yes.

666
00:31:58,037 --> 00:31:59,806
I'm being completely honest with you.

667
00:31:59,807 --> 00:32:03,776
I had never felt you were unattractive or anything like that.

668
00:32:03,777 --> 00:32:05,578
Not even for a moment.

669
00:32:07,447 --> 00:32:11,118
But you asked me that question yesterday.

670
00:32:11,487 --> 00:32:13,887
And when we talked in the terrace the other day,

671
00:32:13,888 --> 00:32:15,687
you asked me if there was an incident...

672
00:32:15,688 --> 00:32:17,486
that made me change my mind.

673
00:32:17,487 --> 00:32:19,828
Even during the game yesterday,

674
00:32:20,227 --> 00:32:23,966
you seemed to imply there was a problem with you.

675
00:32:23,967 --> 00:32:28,168
I had never thought you were unattractive.

676
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:33,168
I thought that if you asked me that question yesterday...

677
00:32:33,477 --> 00:32:35,138
because you believed that about yourself,

678
00:32:35,707 --> 00:32:39,277
I wanted to tell you it wasn't true.

679
00:32:40,217 --> 00:32:41,848
Actually, there were so many good qualities about you.

680
00:32:42,447 --> 00:32:44,188
You had so many good qualities.

681
00:32:44,688 --> 00:32:47,757
So I kept sending you the messages.

682
00:32:48,658 --> 00:32:50,987
Don't tell yourself that.

683
00:32:52,858 --> 00:32:54,556
"Am I the problem?"

684
00:32:54,557 --> 00:32:56,697
You might have asked me that because you thought so.

685
00:32:57,467 --> 00:32:58,497
I'm glad...

686
00:32:59,868 --> 00:33:02,467
that I could clear up the biggest misunderstanding.

687
00:33:12,378 --> 00:33:14,047
What? The remote control is here.

688
00:33:14,547 --> 00:33:16,178
Whose voice is that?

689
00:33:17,217 --> 00:33:18,688
- It's Jae Hyung's. - I see.

690
00:33:20,057 --> 00:33:22,118
Hype boy

691
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:24,057
Why do you look so...

692
00:33:24,658 --> 00:33:26,457
I almost teased you again.

693
00:33:26,957 --> 00:33:28,697
- You did? - Yes.

694
00:33:29,128 --> 00:33:31,967
- Today, you look especially... - He likes to tease people a lot.

695
00:33:32,368 --> 00:33:33,938
What were you going to say? Go ahead.

696
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:35,838
You look like a black rose.

697
00:33:36,098 --> 00:33:37,707
You found a nice replacement word.

698
00:33:38,608 --> 00:33:40,578
You weren't going to say, "Black rose."

699
00:33:46,547 --> 00:33:48,848
- Let's have a drink afterward. - What?

700
00:33:48,947 --> 00:33:52,047
- Let's have a drink afterward. - Sounds good.

701
00:33:56,657 --> 00:33:58,787
Did you decide on what you're going to say?

702
00:33:59,427 --> 00:34:00,427
Yes.

703
00:34:00,827 --> 00:34:01,898
What about you?

704
00:34:02,298 --> 00:34:04,697
To be honest, I don't know what to say.

705
00:34:04,698 --> 00:34:06,128
I still haven't sorted it out.

706
00:34:07,298 --> 00:34:08,298
"You jerk!"

707
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:10,536
(He recommends a new direction.)

708
00:34:10,537 --> 00:34:11,568
"You punk!"

709
00:34:13,477 --> 00:34:14,838
You can blame him or anything you want.

710
00:34:15,537 --> 00:34:16,747
You can curse him out.

711
00:34:18,608 --> 00:34:22,147
Right. If I can bring myself to curse him out,

712
00:34:22,148 --> 00:34:23,177
will I find some closure?

713
00:34:23,617 --> 00:34:24,718
But... Oh, well.

714
00:34:25,617 --> 00:34:29,758
Once you understand why, there's nothing you can do.

715
00:34:31,227 --> 00:34:33,427
I wish I could tell you to only think about yourself.

716
00:34:34,028 --> 00:34:35,797
But I know that you won't do that.

717
00:34:35,798 --> 00:34:37,898
No, I've been only thinking about myself.

718
00:34:37,997 --> 00:34:39,327
That's why...

719
00:34:39,927 --> 00:34:41,797
I'm wondering now...

720
00:34:41,798 --> 00:34:43,637
if I should have tried to see it from his point of view.

721
00:34:44,008 --> 00:34:45,438
Just kick him.

722
00:34:46,307 --> 00:34:47,407
Seriously.

723
00:34:47,637 --> 00:34:48,877
Could you smack him...

724
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:50,907
- when he's sleeping? - Just kick him.

725
00:34:54,477 --> 00:34:57,718
You're a really good guy.

726
00:35:04,258 --> 00:35:06,927
(Ji Won comes up the stairs.)

727
00:35:08,298 --> 00:35:09,596
- Hi. - Hi.

728
00:35:09,597 --> 00:35:10,627
Did you eat?

729
00:35:10,628 --> 00:35:12,996
Yes. I had the toast earlier.

730
00:35:12,997 --> 00:35:14,867
I want to lie down for a bit.

731
00:35:21,707 --> 00:35:24,907
(Jae Hyung spends some time to write something on his phone.)

732
00:35:30,077 --> 00:35:31,148
Yes.

733
00:35:33,017 --> 00:35:34,387
- Hi. - Hi.

734
00:35:34,617 --> 00:35:37,628
- Did you sort out your thoughts? - Yes, I did.

735
00:35:39,258 --> 00:35:40,258
Almost...

736
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:43,227
- Gosh. - Goodness.

737
00:35:44,997 --> 00:35:46,327
- Well, - Yes.

738
00:35:49,097 --> 00:35:52,867
To be honest, what comes after the shoot...

739
00:35:52,968 --> 00:35:55,677
is more important to me.

740
00:36:00,347 --> 00:36:01,477
So...

741
00:36:03,548 --> 00:36:05,617
I think I'll see you later.

742
00:36:07,418 --> 00:36:08,687
Did you shave or not?

743
00:36:08,688 --> 00:36:09,858
I didn't.

744
00:36:11,028 --> 00:36:13,056
- I tried... - Are you trying to look manly?

745
00:36:13,057 --> 00:36:14,128
To express my masculinity.

746
00:36:17,068 --> 00:36:18,127
Rest up.

747
00:36:18,128 --> 00:36:19,398
I'm going to have some food.

748
00:36:19,597 --> 00:36:20,738
Go ahead.

749
00:36:33,347 --> 00:36:39,688
Your eyes on me

750
00:36:39,718 --> 00:36:42,517
(Jae Hyung goes into the bathroom while singing.)

751
00:36:44,858 --> 00:36:47,197
(After he shaves, )

752
00:36:47,198 --> 00:36:49,827
(he goes for a swim in the pool.)

753
00:36:57,367 --> 00:36:59,008
(Sighing)

754
00:37:09,747 --> 00:37:10,747
What brings you...

755
00:37:10,748 --> 00:37:12,747
- to my consultation room? - Seeing you talk...

756
00:37:13,117 --> 00:37:14,817
while smiling...

757
00:37:14,818 --> 00:37:17,387
- This is how it all starts. - Is that so?

758
00:37:17,588 --> 00:37:19,457
- To help you relax. - I see.

759
00:37:20,827 --> 00:37:24,866
I managed to sort out my feelings.

760
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:26,426
- Really? - I sorted them out.

761
00:37:26,427 --> 00:37:27,438
That must have been tough.

762
00:37:28,468 --> 00:37:31,306
When I went on a date with him, he told me...

763
00:37:31,307 --> 00:37:34,107
- Han Go Eun was his ideal type. - Right.

764
00:37:34,108 --> 00:37:36,508
Then it had to be you.

765
00:37:37,247 --> 00:37:38,778
I really don't get him.

766
00:37:39,477 --> 00:37:42,717
He was very blunt when he told me that he had...

767
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:43,787
a change of heart.

768
00:37:45,418 --> 00:37:46,987
When I was listening to him,

769
00:37:46,988 --> 00:37:50,357
I couldn't help but wonder how the time we spent together...

770
00:37:50,358 --> 00:37:53,057
- could become nothing overnight. - It became nothing.

771
00:37:53,727 --> 00:37:56,657
- Then emotionally... Yes. - Right.

772
00:37:57,427 --> 00:37:59,366
- It was difficult to accept. - It must've been very hard.

773
00:37:59,367 --> 00:38:01,037
I was so confused.

774
00:38:03,738 --> 00:38:05,766
I was miserable.

775
00:38:05,767 --> 00:38:09,938
The fact that I had to watch him change was really painful.

776
00:38:11,907 --> 00:38:14,917
I could see that he was clearly into someone else.

777
00:38:14,918 --> 00:38:17,786
- But I couldn't stop my feelings. - Right.

778
00:38:17,787 --> 00:38:20,087
How could you end your feelings when you had them for this long?

779
00:38:20,088 --> 00:38:21,457
- Right. - That's impossible.

780
00:38:21,517 --> 00:38:22,757
- Only an AI could do it. - Right.

781
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:25,657
Yes. Only an AI could do it. Gosh, Dr. Lee.

782
00:38:26,657 --> 00:38:29,056
Only an AI could do it, not human.

783
00:38:29,057 --> 00:38:30,127
Yes. That's right.

784
00:38:30,128 --> 00:38:33,027
I think I embraced the feelings only human can have on this show.

785
00:38:33,028 --> 00:38:35,737
It made me realize what it meant to be alive.

786
00:38:35,738 --> 00:38:38,036
I didn't let my brain be part of this.

787
00:38:38,037 --> 00:38:40,406
- I just followed my heart. - That's so cool.

788
00:38:40,407 --> 00:38:43,007
- That's what I did so far. - That's really cool.

789
00:38:43,008 --> 00:38:44,378
How could you do that?

790
00:38:44,548 --> 00:38:46,148
I could do that after coming here.

791
00:38:46,247 --> 00:38:49,717
When we were young and innocent, we just followed our heart.

792
00:38:49,718 --> 00:38:51,147
And I had never been like this since I grew up.

793
00:38:51,148 --> 00:38:52,516
But it was possible here.

794
00:38:52,517 --> 00:38:55,687
- Right. It was somewhat possible. - Yes. It was somewhat possible.

795
00:38:55,688 --> 00:38:59,688
I thought to myself that I should focus on my own feelings.

796
00:38:59,887 --> 00:39:01,698
That's why I had so many embarrassing moments.

797
00:39:02,227 --> 00:39:03,667
When I was going to sleep, I was like...

798
00:39:03,668 --> 00:39:05,097
- "I must've lost my mind." Yes. - Now?

799
00:39:06,068 --> 00:39:08,136
- "What's wrong with me?" - Because of that thought.

800
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:10,067
I was being myself 100 percent.

801
00:39:10,068 --> 00:39:13,136
It was like showing my flesh.

802
00:39:13,137 --> 00:39:14,707
- Gosh. - That's why I like you.

803
00:39:15,077 --> 00:39:17,177
- Really? - That's a good thing.

804
00:39:17,747 --> 00:39:20,347
But I think being myself made me happy.

805
00:39:21,318 --> 00:39:23,846
So in the end, I don't have any regrets.

806
00:39:23,847 --> 00:39:25,147
- Right. - I did my best...

807
00:39:25,148 --> 00:39:26,417
- during the time I had. Yes. - Right.

808
00:39:26,418 --> 00:39:28,616
- When would we have the chance... - Right.

809
00:39:28,617 --> 00:39:30,827
- to express ourselves passionately? - Right.

810
00:39:31,927 --> 00:39:32,987
You're right.

811
00:39:32,988 --> 00:39:34,857
- I talked about that. - You shouldn't regret anything.

812
00:39:34,858 --> 00:39:35,858
Right.

813
00:39:44,807 --> 00:39:45,907
Did you swim?

814
00:39:46,468 --> 00:39:47,737
- What? - Did you swim?

815
00:39:47,738 --> 00:39:48,738
Yes.

816
00:39:58,418 --> 00:39:59,787
Were you not surprised yesterday?

817
00:40:01,488 --> 00:40:03,117
- What? - Were you not surprised yesterday?

818
00:40:08,698 --> 00:40:10,398
I was surprised by a few things.

819
00:40:14,898 --> 00:40:17,267
Why? Should I open the box?

820
00:40:18,037 --> 00:40:19,637
The box? Yes, open it.

821
00:40:22,577 --> 00:40:24,907
Why? Should I open the box?

822
00:40:25,707 --> 00:40:27,318
The box? Yes, open it.

823
00:40:32,718 --> 00:40:33,787
What's that?

824
00:40:34,517 --> 00:40:36,357
What was that just now?

825
00:40:36,358 --> 00:40:37,358
- What's that? - Gosh.

826
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:39,287
- That's like a skincare commercial. - What's that?

827
00:40:39,427 --> 00:40:40,427
He's going to unveil it now.

828
00:40:40,428 --> 00:40:41,457
Seriously...

829
00:40:41,657 --> 00:40:43,197
- Jae Hyung became evil. - Seriously.

830
00:40:43,198 --> 00:40:45,427
This is insane. Unbelievable.

831
00:40:50,867 --> 00:40:51,867
You...

832
00:40:55,037 --> 00:40:58,077
Some of the things that surprised me was...

833
00:40:58,707 --> 00:41:01,176
that you had a Secret Date with Se Seung.

834
00:41:01,177 --> 00:41:02,616
- Yes. - I heard that.

835
00:41:02,617 --> 00:41:03,617
Yes.

836
00:41:04,648 --> 00:41:07,187
I don't think the Secret Date was made...

837
00:41:07,188 --> 00:41:09,786
just to have a conversation.

838
00:41:09,787 --> 00:41:10,787
Yes.

839
00:41:10,788 --> 00:41:13,826
"Was there a need to use it that way?"

840
00:41:13,827 --> 00:41:15,128
That was what I thought.

841
00:41:15,698 --> 00:41:16,698
You're right.

842
00:41:17,528 --> 00:41:18,668
Also,

843
00:41:20,028 --> 00:41:23,937
what triggered you to like Ji Won? Did you have feelings for her?

844
00:41:23,938 --> 00:41:26,438
I was completely unaware of that.

845
00:41:26,568 --> 00:41:27,576
Yes.

846
00:41:27,577 --> 00:41:30,747
I was a bit puzzled about that.

847
00:41:31,207 --> 00:41:32,648
At first,

848
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:34,818
- you had feelings for Cho A. - Yes.

849
00:41:35,177 --> 00:41:39,188
Right before the final decision, you showed this side to us.

850
00:41:39,948 --> 00:41:43,488
I'm quite curious about how serious you are.

851
00:41:44,457 --> 00:41:48,898
I didn't have anyone else in mind.

852
00:41:49,698 --> 00:41:51,767
It was either Cho A or none.

853
00:41:52,398 --> 00:41:54,637
But on the first night that we arrived Singapore,

854
00:41:54,997 --> 00:41:58,938
in a way, the time you talked about Ju Yeon?

855
00:41:59,338 --> 00:42:01,076
I think I felt that part.

856
00:42:01,077 --> 00:42:02,238
So actually,

857
00:42:03,278 --> 00:42:04,707
I felt very uncomfortable.

858
00:42:06,448 --> 00:42:10,617
I never sent the message to someone else.

859
00:42:11,347 --> 00:42:13,887
That time, I was reminded of Se Seung and Ji Won.

860
00:42:14,617 --> 00:42:16,858
So I actually talked a lot with Ji Won that time.

861
00:42:17,427 --> 00:42:18,588
But...

862
00:42:19,488 --> 00:42:21,657
it sped up more than I thought.

863
00:42:21,957 --> 00:42:23,426
The uniqueness of the situation might have influenced me too.

864
00:42:23,427 --> 00:42:25,826
Maybe I was too deeply into her,

865
00:42:25,827 --> 00:42:28,198
but it escalated very steeply.

866
00:42:29,168 --> 00:42:30,906
So after I finished talking with Ji Won,

867
00:42:30,907 --> 00:42:33,238
we had to make up our mind in the evening.

868
00:42:34,878 --> 00:42:36,637
There were two people's faces that popped up in my mind.

869
00:42:37,508 --> 00:42:39,407
Cho A's and yours.

870
00:43:03,298 --> 00:43:07,477
(3 weeks ago, )

871
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:11,206
(the siblings that share the memories...)

872
00:43:11,207 --> 00:43:13,048
(of their whole lives...)

873
00:43:13,378 --> 00:43:15,878
(started living in the same house.)

874
00:43:17,617 --> 00:43:20,387
- Hello. - Hello.

875
00:43:20,517 --> 00:43:21,616
- I love it. - You love it?

876
00:43:21,617 --> 00:43:22,687
- I love it. - It's harmonious.

877
00:43:22,688 --> 00:43:23,927
It's so harmonious.

878
00:43:24,088 --> 00:43:27,427
(Family)

879
00:43:30,258 --> 00:43:32,797
(We feel something in our hearts.)

880
00:43:32,798 --> 00:43:35,068
(They're really like my family.)

881
00:43:35,398 --> 00:43:41,677
(I don't have to act strong and firm here.)

882
00:43:41,907 --> 00:43:44,346
But I cried internally.

883
00:43:44,347 --> 00:43:45,448
I know.

884
00:43:45,677 --> 00:43:47,877
(More than anything, I can see my sibling.)

885
00:43:47,878 --> 00:43:50,887
(We became even more like a family.)

886
00:43:51,188 --> 00:43:52,347
Someone who's pretty when he smiles.

887
00:43:54,258 --> 00:43:57,457
(The flame in their hearts blazed up quickly.)

888
00:43:58,358 --> 00:43:59,427
I like it.

889
00:43:59,657 --> 00:44:00,657
Me too.

890
00:44:04,198 --> 00:44:05,327
My heart is here.

891
00:44:06,597 --> 00:44:08,568
- Why is it beating so fast? - It's beating so fast.

892
00:44:09,497 --> 00:44:12,107
(The feelings blazed up...)

893
00:44:12,108 --> 00:44:15,608
(and died out.)

894
00:44:17,347 --> 00:44:20,108
When I was with others too...

895
00:44:20,207 --> 00:44:24,048
(The warm gaze that looked at me disappeared.)

896
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:29,557
I don't think I need to discover more about that person.

897
00:44:30,557 --> 00:44:33,956
(The feeling for one person...)

898
00:44:33,957 --> 00:44:37,568
(became a wound for someone else.)

899
00:44:39,898 --> 00:44:40,997
(One person)

900
00:44:43,668 --> 00:44:45,636
I want to have a date with you.

901
00:44:45,637 --> 00:44:46,637
- I see. - Yes.

902
00:44:46,907 --> 00:44:50,536
I think Jae Hyung has some of those qualities.

903
00:44:50,537 --> 00:44:52,676
(Someone embraced...)

904
00:44:52,677 --> 00:44:55,346
(the wounded heart.)

905
00:44:55,347 --> 00:44:56,347
Me too.

906
00:44:57,588 --> 00:44:59,487
(Because of a variable of one moment, )

907
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:02,858
(someone's heart was shaken.)

908
00:45:05,927 --> 00:45:07,426
(Were you sure in the beginning then?)

909
00:45:07,427 --> 00:45:08,427
(We get to know each other.)

910
00:45:08,428 --> 00:45:10,397
(You spoke as if you were sure.)

911
00:45:10,398 --> 00:45:12,027
(That's what you think.)

912
00:45:12,028 --> 00:45:14,766
(Do you think about what happens after the final selection?)

913
00:45:14,767 --> 00:45:17,068
(The meeting after that is reality.)

914
00:45:18,068 --> 00:45:21,537
(And the belatedly-realized true feelings)

915
00:45:23,778 --> 00:45:27,947
(Actually, there's no other choice for me anymore.)

916
00:45:27,948 --> 00:45:33,016
(It's not getting bigger. I've already made a choice.)

917
00:45:33,017 --> 00:45:34,516
(Ji Won)

918
00:45:34,517 --> 00:45:37,628
There was a lot to think about.

919
00:45:37,887 --> 00:45:40,557
There's one person I thought of as someone I could date.

920
00:45:41,097 --> 00:45:43,028
My feelings are my own.

921
00:45:43,628 --> 00:45:45,798
(Yong Woo)

922
00:45:46,068 --> 00:45:49,437
Can I meet someone that makes my heart flutter again?

923
00:45:49,438 --> 00:45:51,738
It's the same as the beginning. Nothing has changed.

924
00:45:52,108 --> 00:45:54,637
I decided to follow my feelings.

925
00:45:54,878 --> 00:45:57,607
Unless there's a huge change of heart...

926
00:45:57,608 --> 00:45:58,608
(Jung Sub)

927
00:45:58,609 --> 00:46:00,777
(Yun Ha)

928
00:46:00,778 --> 00:46:02,648
I finished organizing my thoughts.

929
00:46:08,157 --> 00:46:13,988
(Now, confess your feelings.)

930
00:46:16,597 --> 00:46:18,826
- Professor. - I literally got chills now.

931
00:46:18,827 --> 00:46:19,926
- Amazing. - Professor, today...

932
00:46:19,927 --> 00:46:22,168
Professor's research results are coming out today.

933
00:46:22,497 --> 00:46:23,596
She's a bit excited.

934
00:46:23,597 --> 00:46:25,107
She did her research for a long time.

935
00:46:25,108 --> 00:46:27,108
Here comes the D-day.

936
00:46:27,207 --> 00:46:28,207
Finally.

937
00:46:28,208 --> 00:46:30,738
- We've been doing this for today. - That's right.

938
00:46:31,048 --> 00:46:33,307
- They're doing it now. - We're here. The last day.

939
00:46:39,887 --> 00:46:42,457
(A small cafe beside a train track)

940
00:47:18,957 --> 00:47:22,427
(Someone's coming here to confess to you.)

941
00:47:25,068 --> 00:47:27,898
When it said that someone was coming to confess to me,

942
00:47:28,198 --> 00:47:30,907
my palms started sweating because I got very nervous.

943
00:47:40,048 --> 00:47:41,147
It's clearly Jung Sub.

944
00:47:41,148 --> 00:47:42,778
- Jung Sub. - The pants' width is Jung Sub's.

945
00:47:48,557 --> 00:47:49,587
Cheol Hyeon?

946
00:47:49,588 --> 00:47:50,817
- Is that Cheol Hyeon? - That's Cheol Hyeon.

947
00:47:50,818 --> 00:47:51,927
- What? - That's Cheol Hyeon.

948
00:47:53,088 --> 00:47:54,326
- What? Really? - Is it not?

949
00:47:54,327 --> 00:47:56,097
Did we get everything wrong? We keep getting it wrong.

950
00:48:13,448 --> 00:48:14,778
It's Jung Sub. What?

951
00:48:14,918 --> 00:48:16,147
Cheol Hyeon!

952
00:48:16,148 --> 00:48:17,588
- It's Cheol Hyeon. - Professor.

953
00:48:18,048 --> 00:48:19,616
Professor, take off your glasses.

954
00:48:19,617 --> 00:48:21,887
Who are you?

955
00:48:24,887 --> 00:48:26,757
(The person that chose Se Seung...)

956
00:48:26,758 --> 00:48:28,996
- Se Seung. - Cheol Hyeon.

957
00:48:28,997 --> 00:48:30,758
(is Cheol Hyeon.)

958
00:48:32,927 --> 00:48:34,468
- Hello. - Hello.

959
00:48:35,267 --> 00:48:36,668
- Have you eaten? - No.

960
00:48:37,168 --> 00:48:38,707
- You haven't? - I haven't eaten anything.

961
00:48:39,338 --> 00:48:40,407
I was a bit surprised.

962
00:48:44,008 --> 00:48:45,807
- You came here early. - It's hot.

963
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:48,548
I was feeling so nervous.

964
00:48:54,387 --> 00:48:57,887
Everything looks so natural with Cheol Hyeon.

965
00:48:58,358 --> 00:49:00,127
When I saw him,

966
00:49:00,128 --> 00:49:03,028
my nerves started to calm down.

967
00:49:03,528 --> 00:49:07,767
I got to talk to him for the last time, so I was happy.

968
00:49:09,367 --> 00:49:12,567
I didn't know I was supposed to come to a place like this.

969
00:49:12,568 --> 00:49:13,568
Yes.

970
00:49:13,907 --> 00:49:17,177
"I'll be sending a video message."

971
00:49:19,307 --> 00:49:20,907
That was what I thought. So...

972
00:49:21,648 --> 00:49:25,287
There's something I would like to tell Se Seung.

973
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:27,217
Bright Se Seung.

974
00:49:27,218 --> 00:49:28,317
(He suddenly starts recording a video message.)

975
00:49:28,318 --> 00:49:30,718
It's a message from an older brother to a younger sister.

976
00:49:32,057 --> 00:49:35,528
Thank you for being a good listener during our time here.

977
00:49:35,798 --> 00:49:37,198
Se Seung, all the best.

978
00:49:37,528 --> 00:49:38,568
Bye.

979
00:49:42,338 --> 00:49:43,398
He's so...

980
00:49:45,767 --> 00:49:47,307
- Cheol Hyeon. - He's so charming.

981
00:49:47,508 --> 00:49:49,077
He's so eccentric.

982
00:49:49,508 --> 00:49:51,206
Did you just film a video message?

983
00:49:51,207 --> 00:49:52,247
Yes.

984
00:49:52,448 --> 00:49:57,017
When it comes to delivering a message,

985
00:49:57,177 --> 00:50:00,318
I think it's best to do it via videos.

986
00:50:01,218 --> 00:50:02,587
But it's nicer to come out...

987
00:50:02,588 --> 00:50:04,587
and talk looking into your eyes.

988
00:50:04,588 --> 00:50:05,858
- It's nice. - It's nice.

989
00:50:07,088 --> 00:50:10,056
In the house in Seoul, when you came and talked to me,

990
00:50:10,057 --> 00:50:13,028
I was thinking, "This is tough."

991
00:50:14,338 --> 00:50:15,767
I didn't want to accept that.

992
00:50:16,198 --> 00:50:19,037
Anyway, you came and talked to me.

993
00:50:19,307 --> 00:50:21,576
I think I started feeling better since then.

994
00:50:21,577 --> 00:50:22,676
I thought,

995
00:50:22,677 --> 00:50:24,377
(She comforted him by approaching him when he was having a hard time.)

996
00:50:24,378 --> 00:50:25,676
"Se Seung is looking after me..."

997
00:50:25,677 --> 00:50:27,347
"regardless of the age."

998
00:50:27,778 --> 00:50:30,477
Thank you very much.

999
00:50:31,988 --> 00:50:34,317
I always had this thought about you.

1000
00:50:34,318 --> 00:50:38,227
"I want to listen to what you need to say."

1001
00:50:39,227 --> 00:50:40,587
When we talk,

1002
00:50:40,588 --> 00:50:44,468
even if the direction suddenly changes or gets deep,

1003
00:50:44,827 --> 00:50:46,427
I can keep up with it.

1004
00:50:46,927 --> 00:50:51,307
I thought we were very similar in that way.

1005
00:50:51,537 --> 00:50:55,007
I really liked...

1006
00:50:55,008 --> 00:50:56,738
- your innocent smile. - Really?

1007
00:50:56,907 --> 00:50:59,907
- So I wanted to listen to you. - Thank you.

1008
00:51:00,378 --> 00:51:01,677
You're very precious to me.

1009
00:51:01,977 --> 00:51:05,117
In a way, people that I find comfortable to be with...

1010
00:51:05,418 --> 00:51:07,017
are those that are very bright like you.

1011
00:51:08,088 --> 00:51:10,218
You made me feel lighter,

1012
00:51:10,387 --> 00:51:12,457
and I really liked those aspects of you.

1013
00:51:13,128 --> 00:51:14,128
So...

1014
00:51:14,258 --> 00:51:16,698
Se Seung's bright side.

1015
00:51:17,028 --> 00:51:21,637
I received a lot of bright energy from that side of her.

1016
00:51:22,198 --> 00:51:25,036
(The first day the parents called)

1017
00:51:25,037 --> 00:51:26,508
Where are you? Are you nearby?

1018
00:51:29,338 --> 00:51:31,207
She was bouncy.

1019
00:51:31,307 --> 00:51:33,148
She looked very bright.

1020
00:51:33,508 --> 00:51:34,576
- One, two, three. - One, two, three.

1021
00:51:34,577 --> 00:51:35,648
- Right. - Right.

1022
00:51:38,148 --> 00:51:39,418
It's so pretty.

1023
00:51:41,017 --> 00:51:43,318
(Their impromptu walk was as cheerful as the weather.)

1024
00:51:43,488 --> 00:51:46,286
On top of that, she has a serious side.

1025
00:51:46,287 --> 00:51:47,327
She's very honest.

1026
00:51:47,997 --> 00:51:49,426
(They drank together in the basement hideout.)

1027
00:51:49,427 --> 00:51:50,527
There was one point...

1028
00:51:50,528 --> 00:51:54,838
where I focused on things that I didn't have.

1029
00:51:55,568 --> 00:51:59,906
And this is one of the ways to overcome that.

1030
00:51:59,907 --> 00:52:03,136
If I didn't have it before but achieved it later,

1031
00:52:03,137 --> 00:52:06,008
I could feel more happiness then.

1032
00:52:06,378 --> 00:52:08,477
Compared to those who were born with it.

1033
00:52:09,117 --> 00:52:13,347
When I was young, I desired something that wasn't mine.

1034
00:52:13,448 --> 00:52:15,988
I thought I had to do something well quickly.

1035
00:52:16,157 --> 00:52:18,358
I think I became less impatient.

1036
00:52:18,688 --> 00:52:21,556
In a way, you and I are facing similar situations.

1037
00:52:21,557 --> 00:52:22,597
Yes.

1038
00:52:24,258 --> 00:52:28,137
We must've come all the way here to see this moment.

1039
00:52:29,698 --> 00:52:31,668
He has the same emotions as me.

1040
00:52:31,807 --> 00:52:33,467
He has the same depth as me,

1041
00:52:33,468 --> 00:52:35,508
and it's nice to be with him.

1042
00:52:35,807 --> 00:52:38,206
I had so much fun with Se Seung today.

1043
00:52:38,207 --> 00:52:39,207
It was fun.

1044
00:52:39,208 --> 00:52:41,077
I think I need someone bright...

1045
00:52:41,318 --> 00:52:42,918
beside me.

1046
00:52:43,117 --> 00:52:45,617
I think this is what...

1047
00:52:45,948 --> 00:52:48,758
Ji Won was talking about.

1048
00:52:49,088 --> 00:52:51,286
I think I need someone...

1049
00:52:51,287 --> 00:52:53,557
that can make me become lighter.

1050
00:52:54,628 --> 00:52:56,858
Anyway, I wanted to say thank you.

1051
00:52:57,157 --> 00:52:58,468
Me too. Thank you.

1052
00:53:03,767 --> 00:53:06,767
The feeling I always had for Cheol Hyeon...

1053
00:53:07,008 --> 00:53:09,108
was that I wanted to listen to his story.

1054
00:53:09,338 --> 00:53:12,806
I thought I could become someone...

1055
00:53:12,807 --> 00:53:15,548
that made him feel comfortable.

1056
00:53:15,818 --> 00:53:19,088
Even for the final decision, I think I could become that person.

1057
00:53:20,017 --> 00:53:21,117
So I felt proud...

1058
00:53:21,818 --> 00:53:22,858
and was grateful.

1059
00:53:23,387 --> 00:53:25,727
This isn't the end for us.

1060
00:53:25,927 --> 00:53:26,956
Of course.

1061
00:53:26,957 --> 00:53:29,258
- We can go out and keep in touch. - We can go out, yes.

1062
00:53:29,427 --> 00:53:30,596
- I like it. - You like it?

1063
00:53:30,597 --> 00:53:32,267
- You like it, Se Seung? - You like it, Cho A?

1064
00:53:34,367 --> 00:53:35,798
Did you make a good choice?

1065
00:53:36,637 --> 00:53:37,737
I made a good choice.

1066
00:53:37,738 --> 00:53:38,738
- Did you? - Yes.

1067
00:53:43,778 --> 00:53:46,107
(The person who wants to confess to you is on the way here.)

1068
00:53:46,108 --> 00:53:47,918
(Walk Cheol Hyeon out.)

1069
00:53:48,177 --> 00:53:49,747
I'll walk you out.

1070
00:53:50,347 --> 00:53:51,387
Thank you.

1071
00:53:52,048 --> 00:53:54,517
- It's not even raining today. - You're right.

1072
00:53:56,858 --> 00:53:59,387
- I love a place like this. - It's really nice here, right?

1073
00:53:59,927 --> 00:54:01,557
I love this vibe.

1074
00:54:02,628 --> 00:54:04,427
I know this place well.

1075
00:54:06,028 --> 00:54:07,068
- Really? - Yes.

1076
00:54:07,468 --> 00:54:10,238
I really like talking with you.

1077
00:54:11,438 --> 00:54:12,668
- I'm off. See you later. - Bye.

1078
00:54:28,988 --> 00:54:32,857
(Another person that chose Se Seung, )

1079
00:54:32,858 --> 00:54:35,357
(Jung Sub)

1080
00:54:35,358 --> 00:54:36,457
Here he comes.

1081
00:54:36,798 --> 00:54:38,398
- Jung Sub. - It's clearly him.

1082
00:54:38,727 --> 00:54:39,827
Goodness.

1083
00:54:40,798 --> 00:54:43,438
He went through so many hardships to come here.

1084
00:54:57,448 --> 00:54:58,488
(Confused)

1085
00:54:58,818 --> 00:54:59,847
What's this?

1086
00:55:00,648 --> 00:55:02,758
- Nice to see you, Jung Sub. - Nice to see you, Cheol Hyeon.

1087
00:55:02,957 --> 00:55:03,957
What's this?

1088
00:55:04,318 --> 00:55:05,357
Who's this?

1089
00:55:05,358 --> 00:55:08,227
"Why is Cheol Hyeon here?" That was what I thought.

1090
00:55:08,628 --> 00:55:10,097
"What's this?"

1091
00:55:11,057 --> 00:55:13,168
"Why are you here?"

1092
00:55:14,528 --> 00:55:15,866
Don't fight over this.

1093
00:55:15,867 --> 00:55:17,067
This right before the final decision.

1094
00:55:17,068 --> 00:55:18,667
She won't choose him because they fight over that.

1095
00:55:18,668 --> 00:55:19,907
- Yes. - "What's this?"

1096
00:55:20,238 --> 00:55:22,036
- "What happened?" - "What did you talk about?"

1097
00:55:22,037 --> 00:55:23,307
"Why are you seeing him off?"

1098
00:55:28,148 --> 00:55:29,247
I was looking at him from afar.

1099
00:55:29,918 --> 00:55:31,617
"What is Jung Sub thinking?"

1100
00:55:34,517 --> 00:55:35,717
Have fun.

1101
00:55:35,718 --> 00:55:36,787
- Okay. - Bye.

1102
00:55:38,227 --> 00:55:39,258
(Scratching)

1103
00:55:41,188 --> 00:55:45,267
(Final decision: Lee Jung Sub chooses Park Se Seung)

1104
00:55:46,628 --> 00:55:49,037
Se Seung was standing in front.

1105
00:55:50,968 --> 00:55:53,207
She didn't go to Cheol Hyeon. She's standing there.

1106
00:56:07,617 --> 00:56:08,617
Hi.

1107
00:56:30,738 --> 00:56:31,976
The place where we make the final decision...

1108
00:56:31,977 --> 00:56:33,177
is a place with memories.

1109
00:56:34,347 --> 00:56:36,147
Back then,

1110
00:56:36,148 --> 00:56:38,448
we weren't as sure about our feelings as we are now.

1111
00:56:39,387 --> 00:56:41,918
But now, we're here with certainty.

1112
00:56:43,918 --> 00:56:46,327
How can I convey my feelings well?

1113
00:56:54,128 --> 00:56:55,168
Gosh.

1114
00:56:58,307 --> 00:57:01,977
We always looked at each other from up close.

1115
00:57:02,238 --> 00:57:04,378
But today, we looked at each other from afar.

1116
00:57:04,577 --> 00:57:05,847
It felt a bit different.

1117
00:57:16,517 --> 00:57:18,587
(You will make your final decision after Jung Sub's phone call.)

1118
00:57:18,588 --> 00:57:20,587
(After the call, if you choose Jung Sub, )

1119
00:57:20,588 --> 00:57:22,528
(run and hug him.)

1120
00:57:25,267 --> 00:57:26,297
"If you choose Jung Sub,"

1121
00:57:26,298 --> 00:57:28,668
- "run and hug him." - "Run and hug him!"

1122
00:57:30,037 --> 00:57:31,398
This is a mission. She has to do it.

1123
00:57:33,968 --> 00:57:36,007
(You will make your final decision after Jung Sub's phone call.)

1124
00:57:36,008 --> 00:57:38,036
(After the call, if you choose Jung Sub, )

1125
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:40,048
(run and hug him.)

1126
00:57:42,418 --> 00:57:43,676
"If you choose Jung Sub,"

1127
00:57:43,677 --> 00:57:46,218
- "run and hug him." - "Run and hug him!"

1128
00:57:47,448 --> 00:57:48,887
This is a mission. She has to do it.

1129
00:57:49,957 --> 00:57:51,528
Run.

1130
00:57:52,088 --> 00:57:53,456
(You will make your final decision after Jung Sub's phone call.)

1131
00:57:53,457 --> 00:57:54,797
(After the call, if you choose Jung Sub, )

1132
00:57:54,798 --> 00:57:56,028
(run and hug him.)

1133
00:57:59,227 --> 00:58:04,096
(This is Se Seung's number. Call her and confess to her.)

1134
00:58:04,097 --> 00:58:07,306
(If she chooses you, she'll run and hug you.)

1135
00:58:07,307 --> 00:58:08,778
The text was so funny.

1136
00:58:11,847 --> 00:58:13,807
It was a bit...

1137
00:58:15,318 --> 00:58:16,448
What should I say?

1138
00:58:17,648 --> 00:58:18,818
"Run and hug you?"

1139
00:58:18,918 --> 00:58:21,318
But if she really does that,

1140
00:58:21,517 --> 00:58:24,657
I thought it would feel really good.

1141
00:58:26,157 --> 00:58:27,557
This is crazy. What should I do?

1142
00:58:28,128 --> 00:58:29,726
The whole situation made my heart flutter.

1143
00:58:29,727 --> 00:58:32,826
Anyway, this is our final choice...

1144
00:58:32,827 --> 00:58:35,068
and it could be our beginning.

1145
00:58:39,307 --> 00:58:42,608
(He calls Se Seung.)

1146
00:58:47,548 --> 00:58:49,177
- Hello? - Hello?

1147
00:58:49,448 --> 00:58:50,448
Who is this?

1148
00:58:51,247 --> 00:58:52,747
I'm Jung Sub.

1149
00:58:55,157 --> 00:58:56,818
- Hello. - Hello.

1150
00:58:59,657 --> 00:59:01,358
- You've waited for long, right? - Yes.

1151
00:59:03,358 --> 00:59:04,528
I'm here.

1152
00:59:05,497 --> 00:59:07,298
Good job.

1153
00:59:11,668 --> 00:59:14,206
There are parts where we don't get along,

1154
00:59:14,207 --> 00:59:16,237
but I think there are a lot more parts...

1155
00:59:16,238 --> 00:59:17,278
where we get along.

1156
00:59:19,378 --> 00:59:20,407
And...

1157
00:59:21,177 --> 00:59:24,887
I think my feelings for you are growing...

1158
00:59:26,318 --> 00:59:27,847
bigger and bigger.

1159
00:59:29,787 --> 00:59:32,427
So I would like to get to know you more.

1160
00:59:35,398 --> 00:59:36,398
Sure.

1161
00:59:39,168 --> 00:59:40,397
When I talk,

1162
00:59:40,398 --> 00:59:43,698
I'll try to talk more clearly until the end...

1163
00:59:44,198 --> 00:59:45,338
so that you won't misunderstand.

1164
00:59:47,938 --> 00:59:50,907
I'll try to understand you well.

1165
00:59:52,008 --> 00:59:53,177
I'm sorry, and thank you.

1166
00:59:54,177 --> 00:59:55,548
Yes, thank you.

1167
00:59:56,818 --> 00:59:58,148
Now...

1168
01:00:02,387 --> 01:00:03,457
Yes.

1169
01:00:05,957 --> 01:00:07,028
Come quickly.

1170
01:00:10,157 --> 01:00:11,457
Okay, let's hang up.

1171
01:00:11,767 --> 01:00:13,327
Okay. Run.

1172
01:00:47,497 --> 01:00:49,068
- I did a good job, right? - Yes, good job.

1173
01:00:53,068 --> 01:00:54,536
- Nice. - Gosh.

1174
01:00:54,537 --> 01:00:57,508
- It worked out so well for them. - My goodness.

1175
01:00:57,778 --> 01:01:00,108
- Is it their first time hugging? - It's their first time hugging.

1176
01:01:00,747 --> 01:01:02,917
- It's so touching. - Don't fall.

1177
01:01:02,918 --> 01:01:04,448
Kiss.

1178
01:01:14,588 --> 01:01:18,367
When Se Seung ran toward me and hugged me,

1179
01:01:18,867 --> 01:01:21,527
it suddenly felt very different than before.

1180
01:01:21,528 --> 01:01:24,967
"She's the one I chose."

1181
01:01:24,968 --> 01:01:27,167
It changed like this.

1182
01:01:27,168 --> 01:01:28,536
(They chose each other.)

1183
01:01:28,537 --> 01:01:30,008
It was very fascinating.

1184
01:01:30,338 --> 01:01:34,347
It felt like my feelings suddenly grew bigger.

1185
01:01:34,508 --> 01:01:36,648
I felt so nervous.

1186
01:01:36,847 --> 01:01:38,787
I don't know why I felt so nervous.

1187
01:01:40,048 --> 01:01:41,588
- I did a good job, right? - Yes, good job.

1188
01:01:45,988 --> 01:01:47,057
I feel so embarrassed.

1189
01:01:48,358 --> 01:01:49,758
We should do it one more time.

1190
01:01:50,628 --> 01:01:51,798
- Really? - Yes.

1191
01:01:52,398 --> 01:01:53,398
Me too.

1192
01:01:54,497 --> 01:01:57,567
I thought we'd hug and let go,

1193
01:01:57,568 --> 01:02:00,668
but he kept holding onto me.

1194
01:02:04,338 --> 01:02:05,548
My heart fluttered a bit.

1195
01:02:12,017 --> 01:02:14,448
When I hugged her,

1196
01:02:15,818 --> 01:02:18,787
my arms went around her a lot more than I thought they would.

1197
01:02:19,258 --> 01:02:22,798
"I should feed her well." That was what I thought.

1198
01:02:25,267 --> 01:02:27,128
I don't know.

1199
01:02:28,198 --> 01:02:31,237
I even thought, "Can I meet someone else..."

1200
01:02:31,238 --> 01:02:34,537
"that makes my heart flutter so much in my life again?"

1201
01:02:34,738 --> 01:02:38,847
I didn't think something like this would happen in three weeks.

1202
01:02:39,807 --> 01:02:40,878
- Hello. - Hello.

1203
01:02:41,677 --> 01:02:44,878
(The first meeting was awkward.)

1204
01:02:45,347 --> 01:02:48,657
I had feelings for him since I saw him.

1205
01:02:50,157 --> 01:02:52,587
(The first date happened like destiny.)

1206
01:02:52,588 --> 01:02:54,088
I like those that are pretty when they smile.

1207
01:02:56,858 --> 01:02:58,028
Where should I look and smile?

1208
01:02:58,568 --> 01:03:00,497
- Did you go to a market? - Did you go to a market?

1209
01:03:01,267 --> 01:03:02,996
He understands when I only say half.

1210
01:03:02,997 --> 01:03:04,497
He's funny.

1211
01:03:04,767 --> 01:03:06,637
Do you want to see bad handwriting? Look at mine.

1212
01:03:08,037 --> 01:03:10,576
It just needs to be there. It just needs to exist.

1213
01:03:10,577 --> 01:03:12,476
(They kept making each other laugh.)

1214
01:03:12,477 --> 01:03:14,707
Se Seung reacted well.

1215
01:03:14,778 --> 01:03:16,517
I was very grateful.

1216
01:03:16,718 --> 01:03:18,278
I'm an AI researcher.

1217
01:03:18,718 --> 01:03:20,386
I studied deep learning in my graduate school.

1218
01:03:20,387 --> 01:03:21,387
I see.

1219
01:03:21,388 --> 01:03:23,787
(They had a lot of similarities.)

1220
01:03:23,957 --> 01:03:27,927
(It felt like we became a lot closer than before.)

1221
01:03:28,427 --> 01:03:29,528
I was born in 1996.

1222
01:03:29,827 --> 01:03:31,457
- Nice to meet you, friend. - You were born in 1996, right?

1223
01:03:32,898 --> 01:03:34,698
(Is this destiny?)

1224
01:03:34,997 --> 01:03:37,766
How is someone that's similar...

1225
01:03:37,767 --> 01:03:40,068
to the person I was looking for here?

1226
01:03:41,468 --> 01:03:43,108
I think this will suit you well.

1227
01:03:44,307 --> 01:03:45,347
Cute.

1228
01:03:46,048 --> 01:03:49,818
(Se Seung's feelings grew quickly.)

1229
01:03:50,318 --> 01:03:52,818
Where are you now?

1230
01:03:53,287 --> 01:03:57,758
(Her insecurity grew as much.)

1231
01:03:58,218 --> 01:04:01,088
You weren't sure about me in the beginning.

1232
01:04:01,557 --> 01:04:05,996
(She felt upset when she discovered each other's speed.)

1233
01:04:05,997 --> 01:04:07,766
It started from that emotion.

1234
01:04:07,767 --> 01:04:10,338
The person that was left that I thought...

1235
01:04:10,668 --> 01:04:13,367
was good and I liked until the end was you.

1236
01:04:14,207 --> 01:04:16,806
(While Se Seung was becoming unsure, )

1237
01:04:16,807 --> 01:04:19,507
(Jung Sub's feelings were growing bigger.)

1238
01:04:19,508 --> 01:04:21,608
I came to like Se Seung a lot.

1239
01:04:22,117 --> 01:04:23,977
We're going on a trip to Singapore.

1240
01:04:24,247 --> 01:04:26,418
Se Seung? I wanted to use it on Se Seung.

1241
01:04:26,648 --> 01:04:29,517
I wanted to have a fun trip with her in Singapore.

1242
01:04:29,718 --> 01:04:31,387
Who were you going to give the ticket to?

1243
01:04:31,657 --> 01:04:33,487
I would've sent it to you.

1244
01:04:33,488 --> 01:04:34,528
- Really? - Yes.

1245
01:04:35,528 --> 01:04:38,798
I want to have the next date with Se Seung.

1246
01:04:38,898 --> 01:04:40,926
The dates that I felt good about...

1247
01:04:40,927 --> 01:04:42,997
were the ones with you.

1248
01:04:44,798 --> 01:04:49,677
The dates in Singapore felt a lot bigger.

1249
01:04:51,077 --> 01:04:52,508
You're a good photographer.

1250
01:04:53,207 --> 01:04:54,878
What is it if someone takes good pictures of you?

1251
01:04:55,778 --> 01:04:56,847
- It's affection. - Affection.

1252
01:04:59,347 --> 01:05:00,387
Affection.

1253
01:05:01,347 --> 01:05:05,087
Even if our beginning was different from what we thought,

1254
01:05:05,088 --> 01:05:07,457
the emotions we felt together weren't false.

1255
01:05:08,457 --> 01:05:09,597
Gosh, you surprised me.

1256
01:05:11,128 --> 01:05:12,597
I think you're right.

1257
01:05:12,867 --> 01:05:13,898
I'm sorry.

1258
01:05:14,898 --> 01:05:15,898
Go out.

1259
01:05:17,438 --> 01:05:18,468
I'm sorry.

1260
01:05:19,468 --> 01:05:20,468
How cute.

1261
01:05:20,469 --> 01:05:22,938
(They fought and made up repeatedly.)

1262
01:05:27,548 --> 01:05:29,177
I'm going to like him anyway.

1263
01:05:29,617 --> 01:05:30,948
Why do we fight?

1264
01:05:31,247 --> 01:05:35,117
I think I'm not good at expressing myself with words.

1265
01:05:35,258 --> 01:05:36,588
I should work harder on that.

1266
01:05:37,418 --> 01:05:41,387
(They checked each other's feelings.)

1267
01:05:41,827 --> 01:05:43,257
I only have Jung Sub.

1268
01:05:43,258 --> 01:05:45,057
I only have Jung Sub.

1269
01:05:45,427 --> 01:05:48,097
I don't want to give Se Seung a hard time.

1270
01:05:48,367 --> 01:05:49,967
I made up my mind.

1271
01:05:49,968 --> 01:05:51,198
- Se Seung? - Yes.

1272
01:05:51,637 --> 01:05:54,266
Even if I didn't get chosen for the final decision,

1273
01:05:54,267 --> 01:05:56,108
I was going to choose Se Seung.

1274
01:05:59,608 --> 01:06:07,247
(Final couple, Park Se Seung and Lee Jung Sub)

1275
01:06:09,457 --> 01:06:12,057
- Park Se Seung and Lee Jung Sub. - Park Se Seung and Lee Jung Sub.

1276
01:06:13,088 --> 01:06:14,857
- Congratulations. - They like each other.

1277
01:06:14,858 --> 01:06:16,326
Why did they not kiss?

1278
01:06:16,327 --> 01:06:17,827
Congratulations.

1279
01:06:18,258 --> 01:06:21,567
I think they'll be coming out behind us today.

1280
01:06:21,568 --> 01:06:22,897
Suddenly?

1281
01:06:22,898 --> 01:06:24,298
They'll be coming from there.

1282
01:06:24,637 --> 01:06:26,707
I think they will come out, holding hands.

1283
01:06:26,968 --> 01:06:29,037
They look good together.

1284
01:06:29,278 --> 01:06:31,608
- It's lovely to see them. - I agree.

1285
01:06:31,977 --> 01:06:35,577
You should've run really fast if you were going to run.

1286
01:06:37,477 --> 01:06:38,477
Determined Se Seung.

1287
01:06:43,218 --> 01:06:44,858
I mean... What?

1288
01:06:46,287 --> 01:06:48,697
- You were curious, right? - I said hi.

1289
01:06:48,698 --> 01:06:49,698
Yes. It's nothing.

1290
01:06:49,699 --> 01:06:51,157
- It's nothing? - Yes.

1291
01:06:51,898 --> 01:06:54,297
- I think it's something. - It's not.

1292
01:06:54,298 --> 01:06:55,298
- Is it? - Yes.

1293
01:06:55,867 --> 01:06:57,167
We're here again.

1294
01:06:57,168 --> 01:06:58,867
I know. We're here again.

1295
01:07:04,137 --> 01:07:07,347
Right. They said they would send a message after the final decision.

1296
01:07:07,907 --> 01:07:09,516
(I think the final decision has a different meaning to everyone.)

1297
01:07:09,517 --> 01:07:10,976
(And I think I couldn't express my feelings well.)

1298
01:07:10,977 --> 01:07:12,417
(But I still want to get to know you even after this is over.)

1299
01:07:12,418 --> 01:07:13,886
(Every moment we spent together remains as fond memories.)

1300
01:07:13,887 --> 01:07:15,487
(I will accept whatever choice you make, Se Seung.)

1301
01:07:15,488 --> 01:07:18,087
Gosh. It was...

1302
01:07:18,088 --> 01:07:20,527
such a long text.

1303
01:07:20,528 --> 01:07:23,326
I felt bad.

1304
01:07:23,327 --> 01:07:25,127
I was wondering how he felt.

1305
01:07:25,128 --> 01:07:27,028
(Jung Sub also received a message.)

1306
01:07:27,128 --> 01:07:29,136
(I have no regrets either.)

1307
01:07:29,137 --> 01:07:32,438
(I enjoyed every moment for 3 weeks! Thank you.)

1308
01:07:33,108 --> 01:07:34,338
This is what you sent?

1309
01:07:37,307 --> 01:07:38,577
Are you joking?

1310
01:07:40,008 --> 01:07:42,476
- What did I send? - Look.

1311
01:07:42,477 --> 01:07:43,746
(I have no regrets either. I enjoyed every moment for 3 weeks!)

1312
01:07:43,747 --> 01:07:45,278
Yesterday, you...

1313
01:07:46,747 --> 01:07:47,787
You...

1314
01:07:50,887 --> 01:07:52,357
I was shocked.

1315
01:07:52,358 --> 01:07:56,798
I sent such a long message.

1316
01:07:56,957 --> 01:07:58,456
It's like I was acting cool.

1317
01:07:58,457 --> 01:08:00,698
It sounds like a girl who is trying to act cool.

1318
01:08:01,698 --> 01:08:02,767
"Thank you."

1319
01:08:03,798 --> 01:08:05,637
"I had fun for three weeks."

1320
01:08:06,837 --> 01:08:08,876
Se Seung isn't cool at all.

1321
01:08:08,877 --> 01:08:12,578
She's like a sparrow that acts cool.

1322
01:08:13,047 --> 01:08:16,078
I'll keep teasing her about this.

1323
01:08:16,818 --> 01:08:18,618
- It's unbelievable. - Why did we argue so much?

1324
01:08:19,288 --> 01:08:20,387
Because we're the same age.

1325
01:08:21,847 --> 01:08:23,958
My parents are the same age, and they argue a lot.

1326
01:08:24,788 --> 01:08:26,927
I think I did what my dad said.

1327
01:08:27,087 --> 01:08:28,188
- Like a flash of lightning? - Yes.

1328
01:08:28,797 --> 01:08:30,657
I followed his advice.

1329
01:08:30,658 --> 01:08:32,398
- I followed his advice too. - Determined Se Seung.

1330
01:08:33,097 --> 01:08:35,198
- Lee Jung Sub. - Se Seung.

1331
01:08:37,198 --> 01:08:38,198
What do you want to do?

1332
01:08:39,068 --> 01:08:40,867
- I want to see you. - What?

1333
01:08:40,868 --> 01:08:43,007
- I want to see you. - You want to see me?

1334
01:08:43,108 --> 01:08:44,778
- Oh, my. - At first...

1335
01:08:45,238 --> 01:08:47,207
- She said it, looking at Jung Sub. - This is crazy.

1336
01:08:47,208 --> 01:08:48,278
"I want to see you."

1337
01:08:48,818 --> 01:08:53,118
(She's looking at him as much as she wants.)

1338
01:08:53,318 --> 01:08:54,648
They go well together.

1339
01:08:55,217 --> 01:08:56,988
- I'm hungry. - Me too.

1340
01:08:57,288 --> 01:08:58,717
(Holding hands)

1341
01:09:04,998 --> 01:09:06,797
(Shy)

1342
01:09:12,667 --> 01:09:13,966
Are you okay with sharing a straw?

1343
01:09:13,967 --> 01:09:16,208
I'm fine with it. I actually like it more.

1344
01:09:20,708 --> 01:09:23,917
It was my first time to go to Jamwon Hangang Park at that time.

1345
01:09:25,148 --> 01:09:29,057
(They walked in the Hangang Park on their first date.)

1346
01:09:31,217 --> 01:09:32,288
When did you go?

1347
01:09:32,458 --> 01:09:34,227
- I went there with you. - Oh, right.

1348
01:09:35,188 --> 01:09:36,497
Guys, it's over.

1349
01:09:36,498 --> 01:09:37,958
(He's very upset.)

1350
01:09:38,498 --> 01:09:40,697
- This is the end. - Oh, right.

1351
01:09:40,698 --> 01:09:41,767
Goodbye.

1352
01:09:42,498 --> 01:09:43,898
This is scrumptious.

1353
01:09:44,097 --> 01:09:45,868
If we had come here on our Secret Date...

1354
01:09:46,637 --> 01:09:48,006
We wouldn't have argued then.

1355
01:09:48,007 --> 01:09:50,207
I should've said it better.

1356
01:09:50,208 --> 01:09:51,476
While I was talking,

1357
01:09:51,477 --> 01:09:53,977
I was like, "Something is off."

1358
01:09:55,717 --> 01:09:57,916
- That's what happened. I'm sorry. - My expression was becoming stiff.

1359
01:09:57,917 --> 01:09:58,987
Your facial expression was becoming stiff.

1360
01:09:58,988 --> 01:10:00,647
- I was talking about our future. - Yes.

1361
01:10:00,648 --> 01:10:01,988
And I was like,

1362
01:10:02,818 --> 01:10:03,858
"No."

1363
01:10:04,288 --> 01:10:05,828
"Did you make up your mind?"

1364
01:10:06,688 --> 01:10:08,158
"I think my brain is about to explode."

1365
01:10:09,828 --> 01:10:10,857
I must've been crazy.

1366
01:10:10,858 --> 01:10:12,397
We're so funny.

1367
01:10:12,398 --> 01:10:13,797
I just didn't know what to do.

1368
01:10:14,127 --> 01:10:16,997
I thought you would be a smooth talker.

1369
01:10:16,998 --> 01:10:19,267
- No, I'm not. - You were so pure.

1370
01:10:20,608 --> 01:10:21,667
Tomatoes?

1371
01:10:22,007 --> 01:10:23,108
I know.

1372
01:10:24,578 --> 01:10:25,647
You saw it.

1373
01:10:25,648 --> 01:10:26,778
(Holding)

1374
01:10:31,677 --> 01:10:33,688
- Just hold me. - No.

1375
01:10:34,688 --> 01:10:36,618
(Grabbing)

1376
01:10:42,158 --> 01:10:44,597
(Grabbing)

1377
01:10:45,097 --> 01:10:46,127
You said, "No."

1378
01:12:02,377 --> 01:12:04,477
I'm a little nervous.

1379
01:12:04,837 --> 01:12:07,007
Because there's something left to do...

1380
01:12:07,377 --> 01:12:09,078
in the end.

1381
01:12:15,217 --> 01:12:17,488
I chose Yun Ha as my final decision.

1382
01:12:17,887 --> 01:12:19,586
I liked her because she looked bright at first.

1383
01:12:19,587 --> 01:12:22,157
Since our second date,

1384
01:12:22,158 --> 01:12:23,827
I've always thought she was pretty.

1385
01:12:23,828 --> 01:12:24,858
So I just thought,

1386
01:12:25,358 --> 01:12:27,498
"She must be the one for me."

1387
01:12:27,767 --> 01:12:33,238
(Final decision: Kim Yun Jae chooses Lee Yun Ha.)

1388
01:12:37,438 --> 01:12:42,977
(Someone's coming here to confess to you.)

1389
01:13:10,608 --> 01:13:12,876
I'm not a good talker.

1390
01:13:12,877 --> 01:13:15,917
I kept thinking about what to say.

1391
01:14:04,057 --> 01:14:06,126
(This is Yun Ha's number.)

1392
01:14:06,127 --> 01:14:07,997
(Call her and confess to her.)

1393
01:14:07,998 --> 01:14:09,698
(If she chooses you, she'll run and hug you.)

1394
01:14:17,337 --> 01:14:19,207
(You will make your final decision after Yun Jae's phone call.)

1395
01:14:19,208 --> 01:14:20,976
(After the call, if you choose Yun Jae, )

1396
01:14:20,977 --> 01:14:22,248
(run and hug him.)

1397
01:14:35,898 --> 01:14:37,727
- Hello? - Hello?

1398
01:14:40,528 --> 01:14:42,898
It must've been not easy to come here.

1399
01:14:43,238 --> 01:14:44,297
It was fine.

1400
01:14:47,467 --> 01:14:49,408
I've never actively pursued a relationship...

1401
01:14:49,837 --> 01:14:52,578
like this before.

1402
01:14:53,347 --> 01:14:56,077
I think that's why I was awkward...

1403
01:14:56,078 --> 01:14:58,377
and made a lot of mistakes.

1404
01:15:02,517 --> 01:15:04,117
I thought...

1405
01:15:04,118 --> 01:15:06,157
I might have been getting ahead of myself.

1406
01:15:06,158 --> 01:15:07,227
So now,

1407
01:15:07,757 --> 01:15:09,358
I'll be waiting...

1408
01:15:09,797 --> 01:15:12,198
so that you can take your time and come to me at your pace.

1409
01:15:14,097 --> 01:15:15,097
Yes.

1410
01:15:15,797 --> 01:15:16,837
Okay.

1411
01:15:35,488 --> 01:15:37,557
My gosh. Is everything okay?

1412
01:15:37,757 --> 01:15:38,757
- Gosh. - What?

1413
01:15:39,427 --> 01:15:41,688
Should I say it felt real?

1414
01:15:42,087 --> 01:15:44,126
It felt like my feelings for him grew more.

1415
01:15:44,127 --> 01:15:46,297
I had that strange feeling.

1416
01:15:48,068 --> 01:15:49,126
I was relieved.

1417
01:15:49,127 --> 01:15:50,868
Nothing else mattered to me.

1418
01:15:52,807 --> 01:15:54,067
(Screaming)

1419
01:15:54,068 --> 01:15:56,806
- That's adorable. - Congratulations.

1420
01:15:56,807 --> 01:15:58,707
He must've practised...

1421
01:15:58,708 --> 01:15:59,708
- those words a lot. - I know.

1422
01:15:59,709 --> 01:16:02,078
Yun Jae is amazing.

1423
01:16:03,977 --> 01:16:05,017
You look pretty.

1424
01:16:05,677 --> 01:16:06,717
Thank you.

1425
01:16:09,818 --> 01:16:10,988
- Well... - Yes.

1426
01:16:12,257 --> 01:16:13,858
Why are you not looking at me?

1427
01:16:14,127 --> 01:16:16,158
- You know I'm very shy. - Yes.

1428
01:16:16,998 --> 01:16:18,057
And I'm not good at expressing my feelings.

1429
01:16:19,127 --> 01:16:20,167
It's okay.

1430
01:16:27,068 --> 01:16:30,876
Before Yun Jae came, I didn't know what to do...

1431
01:16:30,877 --> 01:16:34,247
and wasn't honest.

1432
01:16:34,248 --> 01:16:37,046
(On a date with Cheol Hyeon on the 6th day since moving in)

1433
01:16:37,047 --> 01:16:38,647
(- I'm not talkative, am I? - No.)

1434
01:16:38,648 --> 01:16:40,916
(I'm usually not like this.)

1435
01:16:40,917 --> 01:16:42,987
(Am I not chosen again?)

1436
01:16:42,988 --> 01:16:44,256
(It's humiliating.)

1437
01:16:44,257 --> 01:16:45,288
No, it's not.

1438
01:16:45,587 --> 01:16:47,357
(I think I'm going to cry for real.)

1439
01:16:47,358 --> 01:16:49,927
(She cried in front of Jung Sub.)

1440
01:16:51,127 --> 01:16:55,266
Something miraculous and surprising...

1441
01:16:55,267 --> 01:16:58,438
happened to me.

1442
01:16:58,938 --> 01:17:00,068
(I picked Yun Ha.)

1443
01:17:00,208 --> 01:17:03,237
(Every family member chose her.)

1444
01:17:03,238 --> 01:17:05,208
(When they had to choose between love and their sibling, )

1445
01:17:05,948 --> 01:17:09,107
(Yun Jae and Yun Ha were the only ones who could go out on a date.)

1446
01:17:09,108 --> 01:17:10,916
(Oh, no)

1447
01:17:10,917 --> 01:17:12,376
(Please)

1448
01:17:12,377 --> 01:17:13,817
(Your hand is shaking.)

1449
01:17:13,818 --> 01:17:14,847
(I'm nervous.)

1450
01:17:15,688 --> 01:17:16,756
(Gosh)

1451
01:17:16,757 --> 01:17:20,056
(He looked kind of cute when he was nervous.)

1452
01:17:20,057 --> 01:17:22,796
He was very honest...

1453
01:17:22,797 --> 01:17:24,557
with me.

1454
01:17:24,757 --> 01:17:26,766
(He carried her bags as he thought they might be heavy.)

1455
01:17:26,767 --> 01:17:28,698
(If you have a bug repellent...)

1456
01:17:29,198 --> 01:17:31,368
(Following Jung Sub's advice, )

1457
01:17:31,467 --> 01:17:34,738
(he got bug repellents at the airport.)

1458
01:17:35,467 --> 01:17:38,307
(He chased bugs away from the first day of the trip.)

1459
01:17:38,438 --> 01:17:40,707
He always took care of me.

1460
01:17:40,708 --> 01:17:43,846
He checked if I had eaten.

1461
01:17:43,847 --> 01:17:45,777
(I made stew. Eat it later.)

1462
01:17:45,778 --> 01:17:48,187
(I made egg rice. Have a bite at least.)

1463
01:17:48,188 --> 01:17:50,387
(Mixing)

1464
01:17:51,417 --> 01:17:53,488
(He also mixed bibimbap for her.)

1465
01:17:53,727 --> 01:17:56,158
He checked if my feet were hurting.

1466
01:17:56,297 --> 01:17:57,857
(Let's walk slowly. Your feet might hurt.)

1467
01:17:57,858 --> 01:17:59,797
(I can take it out when you need something.)

1468
01:18:00,167 --> 01:18:01,627
(Focus on watching.)

1469
01:18:02,398 --> 01:18:05,837
He fanned me, asking if it was hot.

1470
01:18:06,267 --> 01:18:08,337
(- Are you not getting rained on? - It's fine.)

1471
01:18:08,767 --> 01:18:11,007
I could feel...

1472
01:18:11,538 --> 01:18:13,976
he was 100 percent sincere.

1473
01:18:13,977 --> 01:18:16,117
It opened my heart...

1474
01:18:16,118 --> 01:18:18,778
and made me honest.

1475
01:18:18,877 --> 01:18:20,247
(Do you want to go out with Yun Ha only?)

1476
01:18:20,248 --> 01:18:22,587
(Don't even ask me. Just send a text to Yun Ha.)

1477
01:18:22,688 --> 01:18:25,387
(It seemed they wouldn't waver.)

1478
01:18:26,427 --> 01:18:29,828
(On the day when he didn't receive a text from Yun Ha)

1479
01:18:32,358 --> 01:18:34,727
It was the biggest crisis when I didn't receive her text.

1480
01:18:34,967 --> 01:18:37,037
(We spent so much time together...)

1481
01:18:37,038 --> 01:18:39,166
(and talked a lot.)

1482
01:18:39,167 --> 01:18:41,237
(I care about Yun Jae...)

1483
01:18:41,238 --> 01:18:43,238
(much more than I thought.)

1484
01:18:43,408 --> 01:18:44,777
I like Yun Ha.

1485
01:18:44,778 --> 01:18:46,108
It will never change.

1486
01:18:46,578 --> 01:18:48,677
(The crisis actually made him even more determined.)

1487
01:18:48,748 --> 01:18:50,947
(Do you want to become a couple right away?)

1488
01:18:50,948 --> 01:18:52,078
(I want to become a couple right away.)

1489
01:18:52,278 --> 01:18:53,288
Gosh.

1490
01:18:54,188 --> 01:18:57,717
I'm a little dumbfounded, but I'm happy...

1491
01:18:58,217 --> 01:18:59,788
that I met someone like him.

1492
01:19:00,587 --> 01:19:01,926
It became like this.

1493
01:19:01,927 --> 01:19:04,126
(Final couple, Lee Yun Ha and Kim Yun Jae)

1494
01:19:04,127 --> 01:19:05,198
It...

1495
01:19:06,368 --> 01:19:07,797
He's a real man.

1496
01:19:08,898 --> 01:19:10,897
Yes. Sincerity moves hearts.

1497
01:19:10,898 --> 01:19:12,397
You're right. Sincerity moves hearts.

1498
01:19:12,398 --> 01:19:13,567
I'm happy for them.

1499
01:19:13,568 --> 01:19:15,666
I'm so happy for them.

1500
01:19:15,667 --> 01:19:17,078
Please hug each other one more time.

1501
01:19:17,477 --> 01:19:18,538
It's...

1502
01:19:20,778 --> 01:19:22,917
(You will receive the saved messages from yesterday.)

1503
01:19:24,677 --> 01:19:28,017
(Yun Ha wrote, "Thank you so much for expressing your feelings.")

1504
01:19:28,648 --> 01:19:32,757
(Yun Jae wrote, "I'll be approaching you slowly.")

1505
01:19:35,358 --> 01:19:36,898
You can come slowly, but you should be fast.

1506
01:19:38,658 --> 01:19:40,597
Okay? Come slowly and fast.

1507
01:19:43,297 --> 01:19:45,237
He tries his best to express his feelings,

1508
01:19:45,238 --> 01:19:48,136
but he respects my opinions too.

1509
01:19:48,137 --> 01:19:50,176
So I was very thankful.

1510
01:19:50,177 --> 01:19:51,677
And I found him cute.

1511
01:19:53,507 --> 01:19:57,476
I want to be in a relationship with her right now,

1512
01:19:57,477 --> 01:20:00,047
but she can come slowly. I hope she doesn't feel pressured.

1513
01:20:02,547 --> 01:20:05,057
We'll be sitting next to each other when we go back.

1514
01:20:05,557 --> 01:20:06,687
- You're right. - Right?

1515
01:20:06,688 --> 01:20:07,727
Yes.

1516
01:20:08,528 --> 01:20:10,697
When I came here,

1517
01:20:10,698 --> 01:20:12,057
I thought I would just have fun.

1518
01:20:13,727 --> 01:20:15,797
But Lee Yun Ha got me. I'm in trouble.

1519
01:20:16,898 --> 01:20:18,797
So this happens.

1520
01:20:19,967 --> 01:20:21,167
Ji Won played a big part.

1521
01:20:22,038 --> 01:20:23,107
After I picked you,

1522
01:20:23,108 --> 01:20:24,277
Ji Won picked you.

1523
01:20:24,278 --> 01:20:26,608
It got me surprised.

1524
01:20:26,807 --> 01:20:27,877
I know.

1525
01:20:28,708 --> 01:20:30,278
I did care about you only.

1526
01:20:32,917 --> 01:20:34,587
That's why I was so thankful.

1527
01:20:36,288 --> 01:20:37,818
When do you go to work?

1528
01:20:38,318 --> 01:20:40,358
I'm busy during the weekends.

1529
01:20:40,458 --> 01:20:42,288
I have a lot of time during the weekdays.

1530
01:20:42,458 --> 01:20:44,398
So I should be busy during the weekends then.

1531
01:20:45,828 --> 01:20:47,328
- Right? - Yes.

1532
01:20:47,597 --> 01:20:49,427
Your parents must be very curious too.

1533
01:20:49,667 --> 01:20:52,597
They'll be surprised.

1534
01:20:53,967 --> 01:20:55,807
When I talked with Cho A earlier,

1535
01:20:56,408 --> 01:20:58,908
I realized you were a very nice person.

1536
01:20:59,337 --> 01:21:01,307
I should treat her as if she's my real sister.

1537
01:21:01,778 --> 01:21:03,318
I should be their third born.

1538
01:21:03,547 --> 01:21:05,818
We're gaining a lot of family members here.

1539
01:21:07,047 --> 01:21:08,387
Every family would have three siblings.

1540
01:21:08,948 --> 01:21:10,458
- Se Seung is our third born. - I...

1541
01:21:10,717 --> 01:21:12,386
Se Seung is my sister too.

1542
01:21:12,387 --> 01:21:13,457
- Is she? - Yes.

1543
01:21:13,458 --> 01:21:15,358
- They say we look alike. - The family tree is weird.

1544
01:21:22,727 --> 01:21:25,337
- It's so cool. - I know.

1545
01:21:25,498 --> 01:21:26,967
It's huge.

1546
01:21:27,137 --> 01:21:28,267
There will be a lot of things.

1547
01:21:31,677 --> 01:21:32,677
Let's go.

1548
01:21:32,877 --> 01:21:34,376
Gosh, I'm excited.

1549
01:21:34,377 --> 01:21:35,907
(They decided to go on a date at Marina Bay Sands.)

1550
01:21:35,908 --> 01:21:36,948
Let's go.

1551
01:21:37,217 --> 01:21:38,717
- What do you think? - I love it.

1552
01:21:39,618 --> 01:21:42,347
It's our first date after becoming a couple today.

1553
01:21:43,217 --> 01:21:45,057
I'm so excited.

1554
01:21:45,988 --> 01:21:47,257
Show them your pretty face.

1555
01:21:51,398 --> 01:21:53,698
- Why? - Because you're pretty.

1556
01:21:57,097 --> 01:21:58,797
You compliment me so much.

1557
01:22:00,708 --> 01:22:02,167
Why is your nose bridge so high?

1558
01:22:02,977 --> 01:22:03,977
I got a plastic surgery.

1559
01:22:04,778 --> 01:22:06,577
Why does your family have a high nose bridge?

1560
01:22:06,578 --> 01:22:07,877
All of us had a plastic surgery.

1561
01:22:08,248 --> 01:22:10,448
I like men with a pretty nose.

1562
01:22:10,748 --> 01:22:12,476
I thought it was useful only for breathing,

1563
01:22:12,477 --> 01:22:13,488
but it's useful here.

1564
01:22:17,358 --> 01:22:18,556
(Here!)

1565
01:22:18,557 --> 01:22:20,587
- What? What does this mean? - Give me your hand.

1566
01:22:22,458 --> 01:22:23,458
My hand?

1567
01:22:24,557 --> 01:22:26,528
- Give me your hand. - My hand?

1568
01:22:27,427 --> 01:22:28,567
Why?

1569
01:22:28,568 --> 01:22:30,898
- Oh, gosh. - What is he doing?

1570
01:22:30,998 --> 01:22:32,796
He's completely different. Goodness.

1571
01:22:32,797 --> 01:22:33,837
- I love it. - Please.

1572
01:22:33,967 --> 01:22:35,568
He said he would approach slowly.

1573
01:22:35,637 --> 01:22:37,637
- I know. He's not even nervous. - No.

1574
01:22:38,038 --> 01:22:40,007
- Give me your hand. - My hand?

1575
01:22:40,977 --> 01:22:42,007
Why?

1576
01:22:42,278 --> 01:22:44,877
- I'm shy. - Why are you shy?

1577
01:22:45,047 --> 01:22:47,617
It felt real.

1578
01:22:47,618 --> 01:22:49,487
We naturally...

1579
01:22:49,488 --> 01:22:51,857
became closer.

1580
01:22:51,858 --> 01:22:55,028
His eyes changed a little.

1581
01:22:55,858 --> 01:22:56,898
Is it our first day?

1582
01:22:58,597 --> 01:22:59,997
I wanted to have physical contact with her,

1583
01:22:59,998 --> 01:23:01,497
but I tried to hold it in...

1584
01:23:01,498 --> 01:23:03,868
as it might make her shy.

1585
01:23:04,738 --> 01:23:06,966
(Yun Jae who said he would try to hold it in)

1586
01:23:06,967 --> 01:23:08,038
Give me your hand.

1587
01:23:09,238 --> 01:23:11,578
Hurry up. We should hold hands when there's no camera.

1588
01:23:12,137 --> 01:23:13,677
Give it to me. It's mine now.

1589
01:23:16,448 --> 01:23:18,516
What's the rooftop we saw?

1590
01:23:18,517 --> 01:23:20,248
We saw this at that time.

1591
01:23:20,788 --> 01:23:23,788
(They had their first exclusive time together in Singapore.)

1592
01:23:24,017 --> 01:23:26,056
- It was over there. - It was over there.

1593
01:23:26,057 --> 01:23:28,988
- I think we saw it from here. - Yes.

1594
01:23:30,757 --> 01:23:33,498
- Is this a lake? - Yes.

1595
01:23:34,828 --> 01:23:36,738
You look stunning at night.

1596
01:23:38,667 --> 01:23:40,007
I think it's because you can't see me well.

1597
01:23:41,408 --> 01:23:42,667
(Glancing)

1598
01:23:44,578 --> 01:23:46,077
- Yun Ha... - I'm sleepy.

1599
01:23:46,078 --> 01:23:49,547
Is trying so hard not to sleep.

1600
01:23:51,748 --> 01:23:54,417
Put your arms and lean on me.

1601
01:23:54,887 --> 01:23:56,248
I'll be holding you.

1602
01:23:57,188 --> 01:23:58,257
Yun Ha is...

1603
01:23:58,387 --> 01:24:00,127
I'm suddenly so sleepy.

1604
01:24:01,727 --> 01:24:03,127
- Are you okay? - Yes.

1605
01:24:04,858 --> 01:24:05,898
Go and take a shower.

1606
01:24:07,167 --> 01:24:09,266
Forget about the counselling. Don't do it and go to bed.

1607
01:24:09,267 --> 01:24:11,068
There's no counselling session today.

1608
01:24:12,038 --> 01:24:14,238
Don't you dare come to the first floor.

1609
01:24:15,068 --> 01:24:16,507
Don't come out of the door.

1610
01:24:56,578 --> 01:24:59,318
I thought a lot about Cho A on my way here.

1611
01:24:59,818 --> 01:25:02,217
Because we came here on the first day.

1612
01:25:02,648 --> 01:25:05,716
I honestly thought a lot...

1613
01:25:05,717 --> 01:25:06,988
about the moments we spent there together.

1614
01:25:20,007 --> 01:25:21,107
It's so interesting...

1615
01:25:21,108 --> 01:25:23,778
that it feels like it was ages ago.

1616
01:25:23,908 --> 01:25:26,007
It's like an old memory to me.

1617
01:25:33,788 --> 01:25:35,916
I wanted to see it as much as I could...

1618
01:25:35,917 --> 01:25:38,057
and remember it as a good memory.

1619
01:25:38,917 --> 01:25:42,288
Cho A gave me a magnet.

1620
01:25:42,658 --> 01:25:45,828
It looked just like it.

1621
01:25:46,297 --> 01:25:48,167
So I kept thinking about the magnet.

1622
01:26:05,977 --> 01:26:10,017
(Someone's coming here to confess to you.)

1623
01:26:26,398 --> 01:26:29,108
I chose Yong Woo as my final decision.

1624
01:26:30,007 --> 01:26:33,777
I resented him more for the past two days.

1625
01:26:33,778 --> 01:26:36,407
As I realized that I resented him...

1626
01:26:36,408 --> 01:26:38,916
and was disappointed...

1627
01:26:38,917 --> 01:26:41,617
because I had affection for him,

1628
01:26:41,618 --> 01:26:46,287
I started to acknowledge my feelings.

1629
01:26:46,288 --> 01:26:50,158
From the beginning until now, I've been sincere.

1630
01:26:50,828 --> 01:26:54,297
Those moments were precious to me.

1631
01:26:57,568 --> 01:27:00,466
I thought I would make the same choice...

1632
01:27:00,467 --> 01:27:02,807
even if I were to go back in time.

1633
01:27:03,637 --> 01:27:05,807
I won't change my mind.

1634
01:27:18,488 --> 01:27:24,757
(Final decision: Park Cho A chooses Lee Yong Woo.)

1635
01:27:29,368 --> 01:27:31,198
He looked a little stiff.

1636
01:27:31,667 --> 01:27:34,568
It seemed he knew I would be coming.

1637
01:27:35,167 --> 01:27:38,577
"I want to fully convey my feelings at least."

1638
01:27:38,578 --> 01:27:40,977
That's what I thought.

1639
01:27:43,347 --> 01:27:46,617
It'd be nice if he changed his mind, but I knew...

1640
01:27:46,618 --> 01:27:48,688
he was not likely to do that when I went out.

1641
01:28:00,627 --> 01:28:01,698
Hi.

1642
01:28:03,998 --> 01:28:05,068
Were you waiting for a long time?

1643
01:28:05,698 --> 01:28:07,567
No. It's okay. I was enjoying myself here.

1644
01:28:07,568 --> 01:28:08,637
- You were? - Yes.

1645
01:28:19,717 --> 01:28:21,887
Time flew, didn't it?

1646
01:28:22,587 --> 01:28:23,618
It's just...

1647
01:28:24,257 --> 01:28:25,858
- unbelievable. - Right.

1648
01:28:26,288 --> 01:28:27,427
It doesn't feel like it's been long...

1649
01:28:28,188 --> 01:28:30,797
since we rode the cruise ship here.

1650
01:28:31,097 --> 01:28:32,158
I know.

1651
01:28:32,658 --> 01:28:35,727
It's already... It was when we just arrived in the country.

1652
01:28:44,807 --> 01:28:47,778
First of all, you're a wonderful...

1653
01:28:48,847 --> 01:28:51,677
and touching person who moves my heart...

1654
01:28:52,347 --> 01:28:54,217
in my memory.

1655
01:28:55,488 --> 01:28:56,717
Thank you.

1656
01:28:59,988 --> 01:29:01,127
I thank you too.

1657
01:29:04,858 --> 01:29:06,868
Looking back at those moments,

1658
01:29:07,127 --> 01:29:10,237
I realized we talked...

1659
01:29:10,238 --> 01:29:13,198
and spent more time together than I thought.

1660
01:29:13,637 --> 01:29:16,007
When I first came here,

1661
01:29:16,637 --> 01:29:20,377
I felt awkward and was a little stiff.

1662
01:29:21,248 --> 01:29:24,078
But you approached me warmly first,

1663
01:29:24,547 --> 01:29:27,147
which made it so much easier for me...

1664
01:29:27,148 --> 01:29:29,887
to blend into this space.

1665
01:29:33,427 --> 01:29:36,527
On our first date,

1666
01:29:36,528 --> 01:29:39,096
we listened to carols at the end.

1667
01:29:39,097 --> 01:29:40,267
I really liked it.

1668
01:29:40,797 --> 01:29:44,567
So I thought it'd be nice...

1669
01:29:44,568 --> 01:29:46,837
if we could listen to them on Christmas day this year.

1670
01:29:47,238 --> 01:29:48,307
Since then?

1671
01:29:48,408 --> 01:29:50,837
Because I really liked our first date.

1672
01:29:51,608 --> 01:29:52,677
- Me too. - Yes.

1673
01:29:55,877 --> 01:29:56,947
What?

1674
01:29:56,948 --> 01:29:59,578
(Their first encounter was awkward.)

1675
01:30:00,417 --> 01:30:02,017
(Was there anyone who had a unique taste in music?)

1676
01:30:02,248 --> 01:30:03,586
She likes chanson.

1677
01:30:03,587 --> 01:30:05,757
- I see. Chanson? - But...

1678
01:30:06,118 --> 01:30:08,426
(If you listen to it, it'll be different from what you think.)

1679
01:30:08,427 --> 01:30:09,487
Is that so?

1680
01:30:09,488 --> 01:30:11,797
For now, I remember chanson more than her name.

1681
01:30:11,927 --> 01:30:15,727
(You talked to me first when I was stiff.)

1682
01:30:18,398 --> 01:30:22,907
(You welcomed me with open arms when I came home late from work.)

1683
01:30:22,908 --> 01:30:23,938
Welcome.

1684
01:30:27,007 --> 01:30:28,248
- Hi. - Welcome back.

1685
01:30:31,717 --> 01:30:32,717
How was it?

1686
01:30:32,718 --> 01:30:36,517
(You approached me first.)

1687
01:30:37,217 --> 01:30:39,017
I took a cab and came quickly.

1688
01:30:39,988 --> 01:30:41,487
- Welcome back. - I left work on time.

1689
01:30:41,488 --> 01:30:42,557
You left work on time?

1690
01:30:45,898 --> 01:30:49,727
(Our unexpected first date)

1691
01:30:50,297 --> 01:30:54,467
(I just wanted to talk with you.)

1692
01:30:54,868 --> 01:30:56,307
Because we didn't talk much.

1693
01:30:56,467 --> 01:30:59,208
(We couldn't talk on the first day we met.)

1694
01:31:00,748 --> 01:31:04,977
(Ask me for help when you feel like you're freezing.)

1695
01:31:06,618 --> 01:31:08,717
(I'll be lending you a natural hot pack.)

1696
01:31:09,217 --> 01:31:12,658
(That day when I completely changed my opinion about you)

1697
01:31:13,488 --> 01:31:14,557
Do you want me to hold your hand?

1698
01:31:15,358 --> 01:31:19,757
(You warmly held my cold hand.)

1699
01:31:22,267 --> 01:31:25,597
(The picture we took together)

1700
01:31:26,908 --> 01:31:30,438
(The carols we listened to together)

1701
01:31:31,177 --> 01:31:32,507
(Are we not making a Christmas tree?)

1702
01:31:33,908 --> 01:31:34,977
(Do you want to make it?)

1703
01:31:35,208 --> 01:31:36,277
- Shall we? - Let's make a Christmas tree.

1704
01:31:36,278 --> 01:31:39,876
(I want to look forward to the future together.)

1705
01:31:39,877 --> 01:31:41,517
- It's going to be so pretty, right? - Yes.

1706
01:31:43,917 --> 01:31:47,827
(I started recognizing you just by hearing your voice at some point.)

1707
01:31:47,828 --> 01:31:49,288
- Hello. - Hello.

1708
01:31:50,358 --> 01:31:53,597
(I saw it earlier, but you let it down today.)

1709
01:31:53,727 --> 01:31:54,867
- Let what down? - Your hair.

1710
01:31:54,868 --> 01:31:55,926
- My hair? Yes. - Yes.

1711
01:31:55,927 --> 01:31:57,966
You always tied your hair.

1712
01:31:57,967 --> 01:31:58,967
Right. It was for work.

1713
01:31:58,968 --> 01:32:02,006
(I started liking him more.)

1714
01:32:02,007 --> 01:32:04,837
(I couldn't talk comfortably and was more careful...)

1715
01:32:05,908 --> 01:32:09,748
(probably because I was a little nervous.)

1716
01:32:14,788 --> 01:32:20,158
(You sent me a message even after going out with someone else.)

1717
01:32:20,927 --> 01:32:22,357
I liked him more...

1718
01:32:22,358 --> 01:32:25,958
because it felt like he wanted to assure me.

1719
01:32:29,127 --> 01:32:31,998
This is for Cho A.

1720
01:32:34,238 --> 01:32:35,666
Thank you.

1721
01:32:35,667 --> 01:32:37,908
(I was so happy.)

1722
01:32:38,408 --> 01:32:41,976
(Now that we've both confirmed our feelings for each other, )

1723
01:32:41,977 --> 01:32:46,847
(I'm excited to see what happens next.)

1724
01:32:48,688 --> 01:32:50,757
The times we had together were nice.

1725
01:32:55,727 --> 01:32:57,557
But I was so upset with you.

1726
01:32:58,297 --> 01:32:59,427
I'm still upset at you.

1727
01:33:00,198 --> 01:33:02,297
But this morning...

1728
01:33:02,597 --> 01:33:06,068
I realized being upset was part of my affection for you.

1729
01:33:07,938 --> 01:33:08,938
That's why...

1730
01:33:10,108 --> 01:33:12,578
my final decision didn't change.

1731
01:33:21,547 --> 01:33:25,417
That's just like you, and I think it's great.

1732
01:33:26,717 --> 01:33:29,658
This is the first time in a while...

1733
01:33:30,797 --> 01:33:33,198
that I'm seeing myself like this.

1734
01:33:33,528 --> 01:33:34,528
I see.

1735
01:33:36,068 --> 01:33:37,637
Me too.

1736
01:33:54,118 --> 01:33:55,987
I arrived here a bit early,

1737
01:33:55,988 --> 01:33:59,257
and it reminded me of the first time we came here, like you said.

1738
01:33:59,818 --> 01:34:01,788
We had our first date in Singapore here, and now it's our last.

1739
01:34:03,727 --> 01:34:05,358
I think I'll be reminded of this place even more.

1740
01:34:07,927 --> 01:34:10,868
Right. We would have been on that ship.

1741
01:34:12,637 --> 01:34:15,807
(We were on this show for more than 2 weeks, )

1742
01:34:16,608 --> 01:34:20,846
(and I think this is one of the best moments I've had.)

1743
01:34:20,847 --> 01:34:26,318
(Really? One of the best moments?)

1744
01:34:30,118 --> 01:34:31,957
I think the fountain show just began.

1745
01:34:31,958 --> 01:34:32,958
- Right? - It's insane.

1746
01:34:35,127 --> 01:34:38,498
Being reminded of those times was really nice.

1747
01:34:42,028 --> 01:34:44,398
This is kind of...

1748
01:34:45,137 --> 01:34:49,166
our last moment on this long journey...

1749
01:34:49,167 --> 01:34:51,038
in a way.

1750
01:34:52,408 --> 01:34:53,677
And if I got to see you,

1751
01:34:55,007 --> 01:34:56,507
I wanted to tell you this.

1752
01:34:58,818 --> 01:35:00,448
Even if I could go back in time,

1753
01:35:01,547 --> 01:35:02,847
I think I would have gone out on a date with you.

1754
01:35:04,887 --> 01:35:05,887
I feel the same way too.

1755
01:35:07,727 --> 01:35:11,498
And I really want you to be happy.

1756
01:35:13,227 --> 01:35:14,227
You too.

1757
01:35:18,967 --> 01:35:21,108
I probably won't be able to forget the conversations we had.

1758
01:35:22,438 --> 01:35:24,908
This is how we ended up,

1759
01:35:25,807 --> 01:35:29,908
but I'm glad we got to make...

1760
01:35:31,078 --> 01:35:33,847
good memories.

1761
01:35:40,358 --> 01:35:44,197
Yong Woo seemed confused before,

1762
01:35:44,198 --> 01:35:46,958
but right then he seemed...

1763
01:35:48,427 --> 01:35:50,698
much more comfortable while talking to me.

1764
01:36:03,307 --> 01:36:04,347
Be happy.

1765
01:36:05,648 --> 01:36:06,877
This is the last time I'll say it.

1766
01:36:07,847 --> 01:36:08,847
Happy...

1767
01:36:21,568 --> 01:36:22,828
Shall we shake hands and part ways?

1768
01:36:32,337 --> 01:36:33,738
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

1769
01:36:34,608 --> 01:36:36,408
- I'll get going now. - Okay. Bye.

1770
01:36:59,097 --> 01:37:02,167
He must not have had as much feelings for me as I did for him,

1771
01:37:02,667 --> 01:37:05,077
but rather his feelings were probably...

1772
01:37:05,078 --> 01:37:06,578
growing little by little.

1773
01:37:07,448 --> 01:37:10,277
And I think I read too much into that.

1774
01:37:10,278 --> 01:37:12,648
I realized this here, in Singapore.

1775
01:37:12,748 --> 01:37:16,516
"Yong Woo's feelings weren't that strong,"

1776
01:37:16,517 --> 01:37:20,158
"but I read too much into it."

1777
01:37:25,858 --> 01:37:28,568
It's true that I haven't behaved like my usual self.

1778
01:37:28,667 --> 01:37:31,438
I felt like I could choke on my emotions.

1779
01:37:32,167 --> 01:37:33,907
One thing I'm disappointed about,

1780
01:37:33,908 --> 01:37:35,607
on the one hand,

1781
01:37:35,608 --> 01:37:37,537
is that it wasn't like me...

1782
01:37:37,538 --> 01:37:38,977
to get so caught up in my emotions.

1783
01:37:46,948 --> 01:37:49,917
When you like someone, you're not the only one with feelings.

1784
01:37:50,148 --> 01:37:53,927
I think I realized that I should relax...

1785
01:37:54,458 --> 01:37:58,527
and take the time to check on...

1786
01:37:58,528 --> 01:37:59,858
how the other person is feeling.

1787
01:38:08,467 --> 01:38:09,908
(One hour ago)

1788
01:38:10,238 --> 01:38:12,177
I wrote down what I wanted to say.

1789
01:38:14,248 --> 01:38:17,247
Thanks to Yong Woo, I made memories...

1790
01:38:17,248 --> 01:38:20,377
as sweet as the ice cream that he made for me.

1791
01:38:20,887 --> 01:38:24,188
The Yong Woo I remember is amazing and...

1792
01:38:24,917 --> 01:38:26,886
Are you okay? No, don't.

1793
01:38:26,887 --> 01:38:28,688
(She burst into tears.)

1794
01:38:31,398 --> 01:38:33,328
I think I'm going to cry.

1795
01:38:38,467 --> 01:38:40,068
Why am I crying?

1796
01:38:46,177 --> 01:38:47,908
I think I'm going to cry.

1797
01:38:48,347 --> 01:38:49,778
Maybe I shouldn't tell him this.

1798
01:38:50,748 --> 01:38:51,748
(Would it be okay for me to confess my feelings to you?)

1799
01:38:51,748 --> 01:38:52,748
(You like truffle, cooked liver, chicken breasts, sashimi, peaches.)

1800
01:38:52,749 --> 01:38:53,777
(You told me to try that one chocolate tart in Seorae Village.)

1801
01:38:53,778 --> 01:38:54,886
(Thanks to you, Yong Woo, I made memories...)

1802
01:38:54,887 --> 01:38:55,887
(as sweet as the ice cream that you made for me.)

1803
01:38:55,887 --> 01:38:56,887
(You were amazing, made my heart flutter, and touched my spirit.)

1804
01:38:56,888 --> 01:38:58,056
(I was awkward in the beginning and didn’t know what to do.)

1805
01:38:58,057 --> 01:38:59,216
(But because you reached out to me with warmth, I could fit in here.)

1806
01:38:59,217 --> 01:39:00,287
(I’m reminded of that carol we listened to after our first date.)

1807
01:39:00,288 --> 01:39:01,587
(I hope we can listen to it together again this Christmas.)

1808
01:39:04,858 --> 01:39:06,096
- Gosh, this is so sad. - It went by so quickly.

1809
01:39:06,097 --> 01:39:07,667
I didn't get to read it. It's fine, though.

1810
01:39:10,068 --> 01:39:11,068
Gosh.

1811
01:39:11,637 --> 01:39:13,538
Didn't she send that to herself?

1812
01:39:13,938 --> 01:39:15,667
- What? - I'm so sad.

1813
01:39:16,108 --> 01:39:17,377
Cho A.

1814
01:39:18,538 --> 01:39:20,137
Gosh, I'm so sad.

1815
01:39:24,648 --> 01:39:25,748
Gosh.

1816
01:39:27,248 --> 01:39:29,318
They really made all these memories together.

1817
01:39:29,417 --> 01:39:30,858
She didn't get to tell him.

1818
01:39:34,087 --> 01:39:35,488
She didn't get to say any of that.

1819
01:39:38,127 --> 01:39:39,358
This is so sad.

1820
01:40:24,538 --> 01:40:26,578
My feelings were complicated.

1821
01:40:27,307 --> 01:40:30,248
The thought that this was the end...

1822
01:40:30,677 --> 01:40:34,288
made me wish for more time.

1823
01:40:35,847 --> 01:40:38,887
But I also felt like this was probably...

1824
01:40:39,387 --> 01:40:40,887
the moment when...

1825
01:40:41,188 --> 01:40:43,688
I could make the best decision for myself.

1826
01:40:44,028 --> 01:40:45,727
So I feel bittersweet.

1827
01:41:17,257 --> 01:41:21,998
(The person who wants to confess...)

1828
01:41:27,868 --> 01:41:32,677
(his feelings for you is on his way here.)

1829
01:42:15,748 --> 01:42:18,288
I chose Ji Won.

1830
01:42:18,587 --> 01:42:21,188
There's only one person I've had feelings for.

1831
01:42:21,288 --> 01:42:23,887
She asked me out on a date twice when we were in Singapore,

1832
01:42:23,958 --> 01:42:26,096
and I enjoyed those dates very much...

1833
01:42:26,097 --> 01:42:28,328
and had a wonderful time thanks to her.

1834
01:42:28,427 --> 01:42:30,498
This is our last day here,

1835
01:42:30,797 --> 01:42:33,997
so I want to express once again that I have feelings for her.

1836
01:42:33,998 --> 01:42:35,666
The appreciation I have for her,

1837
01:42:35,667 --> 01:42:36,806
the happy moments we've shared,

1838
01:42:36,807 --> 01:42:39,408
and how much this experience means to me...

1839
01:42:39,507 --> 01:42:41,307
are all things I wanted to tell her about.

1840
01:42:59,427 --> 01:43:02,028
You startled me. Hi.

1841
01:43:02,528 --> 01:43:03,528
(Final decision: Park Jae Hyung chooses Kim Ji Won.)

1842
01:43:03,529 --> 01:43:05,538
You're just sitting here absentmindedly.

1843
01:43:05,938 --> 01:43:07,538
I've been waiting for you.

1844
01:43:09,238 --> 01:43:11,137
- Did you eat? - Yes, I did.

1845
01:43:25,087 --> 01:43:26,118
It's really over.

1846
01:43:27,087 --> 01:43:28,127
Right.

1847
01:43:28,488 --> 01:43:31,056
It feels like we arrived in Singapore yesterday,

1848
01:43:31,057 --> 01:43:32,097
but it's over.

1849
01:43:32,557 --> 01:43:33,557
Right.

1850
01:43:36,398 --> 01:43:39,198
- We can see Marina Bay Sands. - Yes.

1851
01:43:43,568 --> 01:43:45,238
There it is.

1852
01:43:46,337 --> 01:43:47,408
The Ferris wheel.

1853
01:43:47,438 --> 01:43:49,847
Gosh. The Ferris wheel.

1854
01:43:56,648 --> 01:43:57,658
Did you...

1855
01:43:58,818 --> 01:43:59,858
have fun?

1856
01:44:01,528 --> 01:44:05,797
Yes, I had fun in Singapore since the day we got here.

1857
01:44:06,297 --> 01:44:08,167
- Did you have fun? - Yes.

1858
01:44:08,927 --> 01:44:11,897
In Seoul,

1859
01:44:11,898 --> 01:44:15,938
it felt like I had this thirst that wasn't properly quenched.

1860
01:44:16,238 --> 01:44:17,637
I just felt frustrated.

1861
01:44:18,377 --> 01:44:22,707
But when you asked me out on a date...

1862
01:44:22,708 --> 01:44:24,177
when we came to Singapore,

1863
01:44:25,748 --> 01:44:27,417
I was very thankful,

1864
01:44:28,387 --> 01:44:29,847
and I was really glad.

1865
01:44:33,358 --> 01:44:35,958
I wasn't just glad...

1866
01:44:36,387 --> 01:44:38,898
because I wanted to talk to you.

1867
01:44:39,158 --> 01:44:41,097
I think I wanted to get to know you,

1868
01:44:41,767 --> 01:44:45,267
so I was very excited about that date.

1869
01:44:47,398 --> 01:44:48,737
Compared to the two weeks we had in Seoul,

1870
01:44:48,738 --> 01:44:50,637
I was able to focus...

1871
01:44:51,278 --> 01:44:52,836
and be immersed a lot more...

1872
01:44:52,837 --> 01:44:54,778
during these past few days in Singapore.

1873
01:44:55,248 --> 01:44:56,708
Before we came here,

1874
01:44:57,108 --> 01:44:59,677
I was worried about how I would be able to make my final decision.

1875
01:45:00,078 --> 01:45:01,847
But ever since I went on a date with you,

1876
01:45:03,387 --> 01:45:06,217
I was able to have the conviction...

1877
01:45:06,417 --> 01:45:08,658
that I could choose you.

1878
01:45:10,427 --> 01:45:12,898
Of course, that doesn't mean that I want to...

1879
01:45:13,557 --> 01:45:15,967
put some kind of burden on you.

1880
01:45:17,097 --> 01:45:20,137
I sincerely think that this could remain a good memory for me.

1881
01:45:20,467 --> 01:45:22,666
And I think the first person who provided me with...

1882
01:45:22,667 --> 01:45:23,837
the opportunity to do so was you.

1883
01:45:24,807 --> 01:45:26,377
I'm thankful for that too.

1884
01:45:29,108 --> 01:45:31,278
To be honest, what I want to say isn't...

1885
01:45:36,818 --> 01:45:39,586
"Reciprocate my feelings..."

1886
01:45:39,587 --> 01:45:43,057
or "Open up to me."

1887
01:45:43,358 --> 01:45:44,528
Rather, I want to tell you that...

1888
01:45:44,958 --> 01:45:47,328
during the time we spent together,

1889
01:45:47,898 --> 01:45:52,137
I sincerely had a good time, and I felt happy.

1890
01:45:53,837 --> 01:45:57,368
My feelings for you were sincere when we went on dates together.

1891
01:45:58,408 --> 01:46:00,507
So thank you. I enjoyed our time together,

1892
01:46:03,347 --> 01:46:04,347
and I had fun.

1893
01:46:05,677 --> 01:46:07,788
That's what I wanted to say.

1894
01:46:13,618 --> 01:46:14,627
I also...

1895
01:46:15,887 --> 01:46:18,056
sincerely enjoyed...

1896
01:46:18,057 --> 01:46:20,427
the time we spent together.

1897
01:46:21,127 --> 01:46:23,926
The time we had was too short...

1898
01:46:23,927 --> 01:46:25,267
for me to get to know you,

1899
01:46:25,767 --> 01:46:29,467
and I was disappointed that we didn't get to talk a lot.

1900
01:46:30,238 --> 01:46:31,908
But looking back now,

1901
01:46:33,377 --> 01:46:35,448
during our second date in Singapore...

1902
01:46:36,007 --> 01:46:37,716
Even though I had...

1903
01:46:37,717 --> 01:46:40,877
feelings of disappointment,

1904
01:46:41,948 --> 01:46:45,687
I shouldn't define...

1905
01:46:45,688 --> 01:46:48,927
the type of person you are.

1906
01:46:49,158 --> 01:46:52,997
So instead of thinking, "Since Jae Hyung is like this,"

1907
01:46:52,998 --> 01:46:54,568
"he's not right for me,"

1908
01:46:56,627 --> 01:46:59,938
I just think I lacked the time and conversations with you...

1909
01:47:00,568 --> 01:47:02,938
for me to really get to know you as a person.

1910
01:47:10,748 --> 01:47:12,278
That's what I think.

1911
01:47:14,278 --> 01:47:15,417
It's a shame.

1912
01:47:17,188 --> 01:47:19,658
Who you are outside of this...

1913
01:47:22,087 --> 01:47:26,057
is something I've always wondered about,

1914
01:47:29,967 --> 01:47:33,467
but I don't think I got to look into that a lot.

1915
01:47:34,337 --> 01:47:35,337
So I think it's a shame.

1916
01:47:40,377 --> 01:47:41,377
Yes.

1917
01:47:43,148 --> 01:47:45,818
Still, I feel like...

1918
01:47:46,477 --> 01:47:48,188
all the time we spent here...

1919
01:47:48,887 --> 01:47:50,688
in Singapore, in this situation,

1920
01:47:50,948 --> 01:47:54,788
will remain as good memories for me.

1921
01:47:55,427 --> 01:47:56,688
And I...

1922
01:47:58,427 --> 01:48:01,127
I sincerely had fun...

1923
01:48:01,227 --> 01:48:02,627
during the dates we went on.

1924
01:48:03,797 --> 01:48:07,766
So I did feel that some parts of you...

1925
01:48:07,767 --> 01:48:10,908
weren't really compatible with me.

1926
01:48:11,477 --> 01:48:14,237
But even besides that,

1927
01:48:14,238 --> 01:48:17,046
in the situation I am in right now...

1928
01:48:17,047 --> 01:48:19,248
and in this period of my life,

1929
01:48:20,677 --> 01:48:21,688
I have...

1930
01:48:23,148 --> 01:48:27,188
a specific idea of the type of person...

1931
01:48:28,158 --> 01:48:30,557
that I am in need of.

1932
01:48:31,898 --> 01:48:36,198
I think that was what influenced my decision the most.

1933
01:48:37,528 --> 01:48:40,137
I think your curiosity in terms of...

1934
01:48:40,698 --> 01:48:42,607
what my reasons were...

1935
01:48:42,608 --> 01:48:45,278
were answered last night during our conversation.

1936
01:48:47,608 --> 01:48:52,347
So I hope you don't think about it too much.

1937
01:48:54,078 --> 01:48:55,587
I enjoyed our time together too.

1938
01:49:11,467 --> 01:49:12,698
Talking made me hot.

1939
01:49:33,688 --> 01:49:35,328
She had to decide,

1940
01:49:35,427 --> 01:49:36,988
and I think she had...

1941
01:49:39,458 --> 01:49:42,597
concerns and fears about choosing me.

1942
01:49:42,967 --> 01:49:44,466
To be honest, it would have been nice...

1943
01:49:44,467 --> 01:49:46,597
if we had more time to get to know each other.

1944
01:49:46,698 --> 01:49:49,837
But she agreed with me...

1945
01:49:49,938 --> 01:49:51,407
that we really had fun.

1946
01:49:51,408 --> 01:49:53,177
Rather than a confession of my feelings,

1947
01:49:53,507 --> 01:49:55,147
it felt more like...

1948
01:49:55,148 --> 01:49:57,607
we were saying similar things to each other...

1949
01:49:57,608 --> 01:49:59,148
and saying goodbye.

1950
01:49:59,477 --> 01:50:01,586
- I wrote this. - You did?

1951
01:50:01,587 --> 01:50:02,717
- Do you want to read it? - Yes.

1952
01:50:03,188 --> 01:50:06,818
(What Jae Hyung wanted to say to her for the last time)

1953
01:50:08,828 --> 01:50:11,597
I think the dates we went on together...

1954
01:50:11,998 --> 01:50:13,898
will remain as good memories for me.

1955
01:50:15,227 --> 01:50:17,597
(They were flustered when they met for the first time.)

1956
01:50:18,568 --> 01:50:20,837
I'm Ji Won.

1957
01:50:21,198 --> 01:50:24,607
(He's very similar in terms of tendency and appearance...)

1958
01:50:24,608 --> 01:50:26,637
(to the people I've been with.)

1959
01:50:27,177 --> 01:50:31,078
(They were faced with past memories by coincidence, )

1960
01:50:33,017 --> 01:50:37,387
(so they tried to push each other away from fear.)

1961
01:50:39,717 --> 01:50:40,717
(Hello)

1962
01:50:40,718 --> 01:50:41,727
(Hello)

1963
01:50:42,358 --> 01:50:43,726
(Do you want me to take a picture of you?)

1964
01:50:43,727 --> 01:50:44,727
(Sure)

1965
01:50:46,528 --> 01:50:49,097
(They were cautious about hastily getting close to each other.)

1966
01:50:50,328 --> 01:50:52,136
(Do you need help...)

1967
01:50:52,137 --> 01:50:53,837
(or do you prefer doing it alone?)

1968
01:50:54,297 --> 01:50:55,507
(Go and put away your other things.)

1969
01:50:56,068 --> 01:50:58,107
- Thank you. - You have a lot to put away.

1970
01:50:58,108 --> 01:51:00,577
(They had shut each other out, )

1971
01:51:00,578 --> 01:51:01,778
- Yes. I'm going to leave this here. - Okay.

1972
01:51:01,908 --> 01:51:05,448
(but they were slowly opening up.)

1973
01:51:06,248 --> 01:51:08,287
(You're better at singing...)

1974
01:51:08,288 --> 01:51:09,917
(You haven't heard me sing though.)

1975
01:51:17,627 --> 01:51:21,597
(They started out slow...)

1976
01:51:25,868 --> 01:51:26,897
(It was really nice.)

1977
01:51:26,898 --> 01:51:29,567
(The first moment I felt like I wanted to go out...)

1978
01:51:29,568 --> 01:51:31,877
(on a date with Ji Won was during the duet contest.)

1979
01:51:32,278 --> 01:51:35,248
(Love found its way like fate.)

1980
01:51:36,047 --> 01:51:38,347
(Suddenly, I was drawn to her.)

1981
01:51:38,448 --> 01:51:40,148
(But I'm not sure...)

1982
01:51:41,078 --> 01:51:42,987
(if I was drawn to her...)

1983
01:51:42,988 --> 01:51:47,457
(because she sent me a message, or if I've been feeling that way...)

1984
01:51:47,458 --> 01:51:49,327
(without me knowing...)

1985
01:51:49,328 --> 01:51:50,458
(and that was when I realized the fact.)

1986
01:51:55,227 --> 01:51:59,368
(Your voice was so nice, and your wool jacket is cute.)

1987
01:52:00,698 --> 01:52:03,637
(Jae Hyung shyly let her know how he felt.)

1988
01:52:03,908 --> 01:52:06,877
(I'm disappointed.)

1989
01:52:07,677 --> 01:52:10,708
(And Ji Won cautiously let him know how she felt too.)

1990
01:52:11,847 --> 01:52:16,118
(They were on the same wavelength like fate.)

1991
01:52:18,188 --> 01:52:20,757
(Their long-awaited first date)

1992
01:52:21,217 --> 01:52:23,857
- Why is my heart beating so fast? - It's pounding.

1993
01:52:23,858 --> 01:52:26,556
(To be honest, for the first time since I got here, )

1994
01:52:26,557 --> 01:52:30,498
(I developed feelings and felt drawn to someone.)

1995
01:52:32,868 --> 01:52:36,708
(His feelings grew beyond measure.)

1996
01:52:38,278 --> 01:52:40,907
(Ji Won was the only one...)

1997
01:52:40,908 --> 01:52:41,976
(I felt more and more curious about, )

1998
01:52:41,977 --> 01:52:44,448
(wanted to get to know, and cared about.)

1999
01:52:48,547 --> 01:52:49,688
(I think I'm going to win.)

2000
01:52:50,118 --> 01:52:51,458
(I like losing.)

2001
01:52:51,618 --> 01:52:54,287
(I like losing to you.)

2002
01:52:54,288 --> 01:52:58,358
(I don't think it's necessary for me to get to know other people.)

2003
01:52:58,557 --> 01:53:01,227
(When I choose something, I always focus on that.)

2004
01:53:01,998 --> 01:53:05,667
(Once he was sure of his feelings, he didn't hesitate.)

2005
01:53:06,637 --> 01:53:09,937
(Last time was actually our first date.)

2006
01:53:09,938 --> 01:53:13,577
(You were very cheery, innocent, )

2007
01:53:13,578 --> 01:53:17,307
(and energetic.)

2008
01:53:18,318 --> 01:53:21,248
(Jae Hyung wanted to be honest with Ji Won.)

2009
01:53:21,448 --> 01:53:26,516
(You asked me what I was the most beautiful thing I saw here.)

2010
01:53:26,517 --> 01:53:29,988
(What I really wanted to say was...)

2011
01:53:31,427 --> 01:53:32,427
(Yes.)

2012
01:53:34,898 --> 01:53:36,898
(I wanted to say it was you.)

2013
01:53:37,727 --> 01:53:38,738
But...

2014
01:53:40,097 --> 01:53:43,208
(He wanted to assure her.)

2015
01:53:46,177 --> 01:53:48,676
(Once this person becomes my person, )

2016
01:53:48,677 --> 01:53:51,148
(I really prioritize her.)

2017
01:53:51,948 --> 01:53:56,586
(Once I am sure that this is my person, )

2018
01:53:56,587 --> 01:54:00,618
(I want to be loved, cherished, and adored by her.)

2019
01:54:01,757 --> 01:54:04,898
(He expressed his sincerity to her until the end.)

2020
01:54:05,458 --> 01:54:09,766
(The first time I felt you were different...)

2021
01:54:09,767 --> 01:54:14,666
(was when I saw you during the duet contest.)

2022
01:54:14,667 --> 01:54:18,577
(I took my time watching your face and how you behaved, )

2023
01:54:18,578 --> 01:54:22,908
(and I felt like you were deep as a person.)

2024
01:54:24,347 --> 01:54:28,717
(He confessed to her about the moment she caught his eye.)

2025
01:54:29,988 --> 01:54:32,318
(This morning)

2026
01:54:34,087 --> 01:54:35,426
- Hi. - Hi.

2027
01:54:35,427 --> 01:54:36,427
Did you eat?

2028
01:54:36,488 --> 01:54:38,727
I had some toast earlier,

2029
01:54:38,828 --> 01:54:40,597
so I'm going to lie down for a bit.

2030
01:54:45,438 --> 01:54:48,408
(He was standing there for a while by himself...)

2031
01:54:48,708 --> 01:54:52,078
(as he wrote his sincere feelings for the last time.)

2032
01:54:52,977 --> 01:54:55,376
(When it came to making my final decision, )

2033
01:54:55,377 --> 01:54:57,176
(it wasn't difficult for me.)

2034
01:54:57,177 --> 01:54:58,917
(But to be honest, I feel...)

2035
01:55:00,547 --> 01:55:03,118
(In the end, I can tell what her decision is going to be.)

2036
01:55:03,717 --> 01:55:06,788
(Their parting came up quickly.)

2037
01:55:08,488 --> 01:55:10,827
I respect whatever you decide.

2038
01:55:10,828 --> 01:55:11,828
Let's be on good terms.

2039
01:55:13,398 --> 01:55:14,398
You're cool.

2040
01:55:14,627 --> 01:55:16,198
I should go.

2041
01:55:17,127 --> 01:55:18,127
Okay.

2042
01:55:18,967 --> 01:55:21,238
(He hands his farewell.)

2043
01:55:30,547 --> 01:55:31,547
Bye, Jae Hyung.

2044
01:56:11,118 --> 01:56:14,017
Just as we had agreed fate is real,

2045
01:56:14,358 --> 01:56:17,726
I do think that if we were to go our separate ways,

2046
01:56:17,727 --> 01:56:19,158
it would be our fate.

2047
01:56:35,278 --> 01:56:36,278
- Gosh. - Gosh.

2048
01:56:37,108 --> 01:56:39,248
- I feel bad for him. - Right.

2049
01:56:39,347 --> 01:56:40,547
My heart breaks for him.

2050
01:56:40,618 --> 01:56:42,417
My goodness.

2051
01:56:42,847 --> 01:56:45,287
I think he had a feeling about it.

2052
01:56:45,288 --> 01:56:46,916
- Of course. - Of course.

2053
01:56:46,917 --> 01:56:48,017
- How could he not know? - He knows.

2054
01:56:48,158 --> 01:56:49,726
Things were going so well,

2055
01:56:49,727 --> 01:56:51,458
and this happened within a day.

2056
01:56:51,927 --> 01:56:53,627
- My goodness. - Gosh.

2057
01:56:54,227 --> 01:56:55,568
They weren't meant to be together.

2058
01:56:56,068 --> 01:56:58,938
"They weren't meant to be." That phrase fits this situation.

2059
01:56:59,438 --> 01:57:00,898
I feel bitter.

2060
01:57:01,097 --> 01:57:03,368
Feelings are difficult.

2061
01:57:03,568 --> 01:57:04,568
Right.

2062
01:57:46,578 --> 01:57:50,817
(Someone who wants to confess his feelings to you will call soon.)

2063
01:57:50,818 --> 01:57:55,127
(Answer his call and confession, and then tell him how you feel too.)

2064
01:57:55,828 --> 01:57:59,427
I was expecting either Yong Woo or Cheol Hyeon.

2065
01:58:00,158 --> 01:58:01,158
I felt complicated.

2066
01:58:01,767 --> 01:58:04,427
Did I make the right decision?

2067
01:58:10,137 --> 01:58:12,738
Confession and then tell him...

2068
01:58:20,948 --> 01:58:24,288
(She got the call.)

2069
01:58:31,688 --> 01:58:33,528
- Hello? - Hello?

2070
01:58:33,727 --> 01:58:34,927
Hi.

2071
01:58:36,427 --> 01:58:39,137
As soon as I answered, I knew it was Yong Woo's voice.

2072
01:58:39,868 --> 01:58:43,068
This voice belongs to someone I know.

2073
01:58:43,337 --> 01:58:44,337
I know.

2074
01:58:45,438 --> 01:58:48,708
Did you get some good sleep today?

2075
01:58:49,278 --> 01:58:51,078
I slept a lot.

2076
01:58:51,748 --> 01:58:53,618
Someone secretly took a picture of me too.

2077
01:58:55,017 --> 01:58:56,287
You were sleeping with your eyes open,

2078
01:58:56,288 --> 01:58:57,917
so I thought something was wrong...

2079
01:58:58,717 --> 01:59:00,557
and I wanted to record it.

2080
01:59:00,858 --> 01:59:02,256
Thankfully, you woke up.

2081
01:59:02,257 --> 01:59:03,958
Were my eyes open?

2082
01:59:04,057 --> 01:59:05,898
At first, I thought you were looking at me.

2083
01:59:08,498 --> 01:59:10,828
Stop teasing me.

2084
01:59:13,068 --> 01:59:14,697
I'm so used to talking to you face to face that...

2085
01:59:14,698 --> 01:59:17,307
it feels strange to talk on the phone.

2086
01:59:18,007 --> 01:59:20,708
I know. So this is how your voice sounds.

2087
01:59:21,908 --> 01:59:23,047
Is it different?

2088
01:59:23,148 --> 01:59:24,208
No, it's the same.

2089
01:59:26,217 --> 01:59:29,087
You know, I don't believe in destiny.

2090
01:59:29,288 --> 01:59:30,288
That's right.

2091
01:59:32,017 --> 01:59:34,958
I plan to try believing in it.

2092
01:59:37,557 --> 01:59:39,028
How are you feeling?

2093
01:59:39,557 --> 01:59:44,097
Now, I am feeling more at ease.

2094
01:59:44,427 --> 01:59:47,938
After talking to you for the last time yesterday,

2095
01:59:49,608 --> 01:59:52,377
I felt more comfortable.

2096
01:59:52,637 --> 01:59:56,108
And things became more certain...

2097
01:59:56,807 --> 01:59:58,448
for me.

2098
02:00:00,217 --> 02:00:02,416
What are your options now?

2099
02:00:02,417 --> 02:00:04,046
I am a bit slow to understand.

2100
02:00:04,047 --> 02:00:07,487
Seriously. You need an explanation, right?

2101
02:00:07,488 --> 02:00:08,488
Yes.

2102
02:00:08,489 --> 02:00:11,358
After we had the last date yesterday,

2103
02:00:11,458 --> 02:00:15,827
it was natural for me to have worries.

2104
02:00:15,828 --> 02:00:17,568
- What? - Hi.

2105
02:00:19,438 --> 02:00:21,097
- What? - Hi.

2106
02:00:25,038 --> 02:00:27,337
(Final decision: Lee Yong Woo chooses Kim Ji Won.)

2107
02:00:27,877 --> 02:00:30,547
Seeing her standing there made me content.

2108
02:00:31,177 --> 02:00:35,078
I was happy that I came this far.

2109
02:00:37,587 --> 02:00:39,717
Like I said yesterday,

2110
02:00:40,717 --> 02:00:43,528
sending the last message...

2111
02:00:44,587 --> 02:00:48,727
made me realize that my option...

2112
02:00:49,398 --> 02:00:52,198
had narrowed down to one.

2113
02:00:54,698 --> 02:00:58,507
And talking to you for the last time helped me make up my mind.

2114
02:00:59,738 --> 02:01:02,148
So I could sleep comfortably.

2115
02:01:03,677 --> 02:01:04,778
Right. You slept well.

2116
02:01:05,108 --> 02:01:06,716
You are so annoying.

2117
02:01:06,717 --> 02:01:07,917
Your heart was at ease.

2118
02:01:09,887 --> 02:01:11,547
To be honest, I couldn't sleep well yesterday.

2119
02:01:11,847 --> 02:01:13,087
Really? Why not?

2120
02:01:15,358 --> 02:01:18,188
I told you that my feelings increased...

2121
02:01:18,927 --> 02:01:21,057
from number zero.

2122
02:01:22,898 --> 02:01:24,667
Since I couldn't sleep,

2123
02:01:26,167 --> 02:01:27,198
I thought hard.

2124
02:01:27,398 --> 02:01:30,208
Come to think of it,

2125
02:01:32,007 --> 02:01:33,538
zero got added to the end...

2126
02:01:34,738 --> 02:01:36,477
and one got added to the front.

2127
02:01:36,578 --> 02:01:38,947
(His feelings for Ji Won became 100.)

2128
02:01:38,948 --> 02:01:40,278
- Is that so? - Yes.

2129
02:01:41,677 --> 02:01:42,847
In a sense,

2130
02:01:43,587 --> 02:01:46,288
this is our final moment here.

2131
02:01:47,087 --> 02:01:48,118
That's right.

2132
02:01:49,627 --> 02:01:51,556
While we had many days together,

2133
02:01:51,557 --> 02:01:55,368
we didn't spend a lot of them getting to know each other.

2134
02:01:58,738 --> 02:02:02,738
Shall we go back to Korea and spend time together?

2135
02:02:05,337 --> 02:02:06,337
Shall we do that?

2136
02:02:16,688 --> 02:02:17,818
Hello.

2137
02:02:27,958 --> 02:02:29,068
Hello.

2138
02:02:54,087 --> 02:02:58,257
Yong Woo walked over and hugged me.

2139
02:02:58,658 --> 02:03:00,358
It felt very cosy.

2140
02:03:01,398 --> 02:03:04,827
I wondered if I had made the right decision...

2141
02:03:04,828 --> 02:03:06,337
while waiting alone.

2142
02:03:06,698 --> 02:03:08,807
In that moment, I thought that I had.

2143
02:03:11,007 --> 02:03:12,408
You smell nice.

2144
02:03:12,738 --> 02:03:13,738
Really?

2145
02:03:15,448 --> 02:03:17,807
It's so fascinating.

2146
02:03:18,347 --> 02:03:19,347
I know.

2147
02:03:21,248 --> 02:03:23,948
Ji Won pulls people toward her.

2148
02:03:24,347 --> 02:03:26,016
She makes me want to joke around with her...

2149
02:03:26,017 --> 02:03:27,517
and talk to her.

2150
02:03:27,788 --> 02:03:29,257
She is someone who catches my eye.

2151
02:03:39,868 --> 02:03:41,767
- I had no idea. - Seriously.

2152
02:03:42,568 --> 02:03:44,136
- Don't tease me. - Okay.

2153
02:03:44,137 --> 02:03:45,408
Treat me with warmth.

2154
02:03:45,507 --> 02:03:46,708
Okay.

2155
02:03:47,078 --> 02:03:51,877
Was it a bit short? Our...

2156
02:03:52,278 --> 02:03:54,877
- Our what? - Our hug.

2157
02:03:58,017 --> 02:03:59,917
I think I wanted to hug her.

2158
02:04:00,288 --> 02:04:01,988
Although it was a bit awkward,

2159
02:04:02,087 --> 02:04:04,858
I even enjoyed the awkwardness.

2160
02:04:06,858 --> 02:04:08,397
- It was long enough. - Was it long enough?

2161
02:04:08,398 --> 02:04:09,568
I will keep my distance then.

2162
02:04:10,597 --> 02:04:11,926
- A safe distance. - We haven't been...

2163
02:04:11,927 --> 02:04:13,037
this close before.

2164
02:04:13,038 --> 02:04:14,867
I wanted to see you up close.

2165
02:04:14,868 --> 02:04:15,908
Okay.

2166
02:04:21,278 --> 02:04:23,608
(You will receive the saved messages from yesterday.)

2167
02:04:23,948 --> 02:04:25,846
(I like myself for being like this.)

2168
02:04:25,847 --> 02:04:27,846
(But sometimes, I want to share.)

2169
02:04:27,847 --> 02:04:29,886
(Perhaps we can become closer...)

2170
02:04:29,887 --> 02:04:31,387
(and talk about many things together. From Ji Won)

2171
02:04:31,587 --> 02:04:33,987
(Hello. Only at the last moment, I am sending you the first message.)

2172
02:04:33,988 --> 02:04:36,386
(After many events and deep thoughts, )

2173
02:04:36,387 --> 02:04:38,796
(I have a small present for you.)

2174
02:04:38,797 --> 02:04:41,226
(See you tomorrow. Good night.)

2175
02:04:41,227 --> 02:04:42,427
(From Yong Woo)

2176
02:04:43,328 --> 02:04:46,038
You are right. This is the first message.

2177
02:04:48,637 --> 02:04:50,608
You didn't send a message after enjoying the sashimi.

2178
02:04:53,108 --> 02:04:55,748
I think you will tease me about it for a long time.

2179
02:04:57,507 --> 02:05:00,278
You should get more practice...

2180
02:05:00,948 --> 02:05:01,948
in shooting.

2181
02:05:05,217 --> 02:05:09,988
(Final couple, Lee Yong Woo and Kim Ji Won)

2182
02:05:10,528 --> 02:05:12,698
(2 weeks ago, Seoul)

2183
02:05:15,898 --> 02:05:17,666
(- Hello. - Hello.)

2184
02:05:17,667 --> 02:05:19,296
(My name is Ji Won.)

2185
02:05:19,297 --> 02:05:20,538
(It's Ji Won.)

2186
02:05:21,238 --> 02:05:24,267
(Their 1st meeting lasted 10 minutes.)

2187
02:05:24,507 --> 02:05:25,777
- Yong Woo. - Yes.

2188
02:05:25,778 --> 02:05:27,038
- It's nice to meet you. - It's nice to meet you.

2189
02:05:28,078 --> 02:05:31,547
(After the conversation, Ji Won chose Yong Woo.)

2190
02:05:31,847 --> 02:05:34,546
(As for Yong Woo... These days, )

2191
02:05:34,547 --> 02:05:38,187
(I began wanting to meet someone...)

2192
02:05:38,188 --> 02:05:40,087
(I could depend on.)

2193
02:05:40,318 --> 02:05:42,457
(He is someone I want to like, )

2194
02:05:42,458 --> 02:05:43,487
(someone I want to try liking, )

2195
02:05:43,488 --> 02:05:47,898
(and someone I want to date.)

2196
02:05:48,797 --> 02:05:51,466
(On the day of the first snow, )

2197
02:05:51,467 --> 02:05:53,597
(they had the first date.)

2198
02:05:54,267 --> 02:05:56,166
(It's snowing a lot.)

2199
02:05:56,167 --> 02:05:57,938
(The first snow is falling.)

2200
02:05:58,938 --> 02:06:00,237
(You walk fast, right?)

2201
02:06:00,238 --> 02:06:01,877
(Me? That's right.)

2202
02:06:03,208 --> 02:06:06,147
(It has been a while since I met someone who matched my strides.)

2203
02:06:06,148 --> 02:06:07,317
- Really? - Yes.

2204
02:06:07,318 --> 02:06:11,247
(We seem similar, but we are very different.)

2205
02:06:11,248 --> 02:06:12,256
(I had the same thought.)

2206
02:06:12,257 --> 02:06:13,257
(- Right? - Yes.)

2207
02:06:13,717 --> 02:06:18,927
(From the start, they thought that they resembled each other.)

2208
02:06:19,898 --> 02:06:22,766
(I think that's the exact same clothing I brought.)

2209
02:06:22,767 --> 02:06:23,767
(This one?)

2210
02:06:23,828 --> 02:06:25,368
(How is that possible?)

2211
02:06:26,267 --> 02:06:27,296
(What?)

2212
02:06:27,297 --> 02:06:28,796
(What?)

2213
02:06:28,797 --> 02:06:30,567
(-That clothing. - You are right.)

2214
02:06:30,568 --> 02:06:31,806
(I thought you were wearing mine.)

2215
02:06:31,807 --> 02:06:33,807
(People will think that I am wearing yours.)

2216
02:06:34,108 --> 02:06:36,507
(The two of them even had similar tastes in clothing.)

2217
02:06:36,908 --> 02:06:39,247
Since I could see the close resemblance,

2218
02:06:39,248 --> 02:06:41,877
I think I tried not to get to know Ji Won.

2219
02:06:42,347 --> 02:06:44,716
Although I was interested in her,

2220
02:06:44,717 --> 02:06:46,157
I pushed her away.

2221
02:06:46,158 --> 02:06:49,727
I had such unintended emotions.

2222
02:06:50,587 --> 02:06:53,328
When we were together, I felt very comfortable.

2223
02:06:53,528 --> 02:06:56,328
But I always wanted to avoid spending time by ourselves.

2224
02:06:56,427 --> 02:06:59,836
There has always been...

2225
02:06:59,837 --> 02:07:01,337
a sense of discomfort.

2226
02:07:01,698 --> 02:07:04,068
I felt like he would see the side of me...

2227
02:07:04,637 --> 02:07:06,778
I hadn't shown anyone else.

2228
02:07:07,477 --> 02:07:11,108
I think I had that thought subconsciously.

2229
02:07:12,208 --> 02:07:17,586
(I told you that my feelings were growing from number zero.)

2230
02:07:17,587 --> 02:07:19,957
(I had this thought while saying those words.)

2231
02:07:19,958 --> 02:07:21,756
("It isn't that my feelings are growing.")

2232
02:07:21,757 --> 02:07:25,528
("I already made a decision.")

2233
02:07:25,627 --> 02:07:28,557
(They conversed and shared their worries for a long time.)

2234
02:07:29,328 --> 02:07:30,697
(I plan to share those things.)

2235
02:07:30,698 --> 02:07:32,897
(I think I am changing here.)

2236
02:07:32,898 --> 02:07:34,837
(I learned so many things here.)

2237
02:07:35,337 --> 02:07:39,707
(To Yun Jae, your parents, especially your mom, )

2238
02:07:39,708 --> 02:07:41,507
(and me, )

2239
02:07:42,807 --> 02:07:46,148
(you can be comfortable without the mask.)

2240
02:07:46,748 --> 02:07:50,217
(You can show that side of you.)

2241
02:07:50,648 --> 02:07:54,118
(Those were the words Ji Won needed.)

2242
02:07:55,017 --> 02:07:58,887
He said, "You can tell me."

2243
02:07:59,127 --> 02:08:02,627
"Let's put down our masks now."

2244
02:08:03,028 --> 02:08:06,038
I am thankful that Yong Woo understands the things...

2245
02:08:06,137 --> 02:08:07,938
I don't say with words.

2246
02:08:08,337 --> 02:08:11,068
I am someone who finds it very hard...

2247
02:08:11,467 --> 02:08:12,938
to express...

2248
02:08:13,038 --> 02:08:15,948
the emotions I feel with words.

2249
02:08:16,208 --> 02:08:20,148
I was used to taking care of my own emotions.

2250
02:08:20,477 --> 02:08:23,318
The fact that he can understand them...

2251
02:08:23,417 --> 02:08:25,318
without an explanation...

2252
02:08:25,788 --> 02:08:27,217
is very precious.

2253
02:08:27,688 --> 02:08:28,688
Knock, knock.

2254
02:08:28,689 --> 02:08:30,087
(This morning)

2255
02:08:30,528 --> 02:08:33,398
Knock, knock. Are you sleeping?

2256
02:08:46,038 --> 02:08:47,038
Don't tease me.

2257
02:08:47,337 --> 02:08:50,477
Okay. Do I tease you a lot?

2258
02:08:51,078 --> 02:08:52,108
Don't you tease me a lot?

2259
02:08:53,177 --> 02:08:55,346
- Well... - Erase that photo first.

2260
02:08:55,347 --> 02:08:56,586
- That photo? - Yes.

2261
02:08:56,587 --> 02:08:58,546
- As for that photo... - I don't need...

2262
02:08:58,547 --> 02:09:01,387
another small present. Go ahead a delete that photo.

2263
02:09:01,587 --> 02:09:04,458
I get enough teasing from my current roommate.

2264
02:09:05,328 --> 02:09:07,898
I became very close to him.

2265
02:09:08,757 --> 02:09:10,297
I imagined...

2266
02:09:10,967 --> 02:09:13,137
finding someone who could teach a lesson...

2267
02:09:13,337 --> 02:09:14,636
to my current roommate.

2268
02:09:14,637 --> 02:09:15,908
But you teamed up with him.

2269
02:09:17,238 --> 02:09:19,077
Your imagination doesn't always become a reality.

2270
02:09:19,078 --> 02:09:21,278
You are so annoying. You always have the last word.

2271
02:09:23,408 --> 02:09:26,118
This place looked pretty on my way here.

2272
02:09:26,778 --> 02:09:30,247
I could enjoy the nightscape fully.

2273
02:09:30,248 --> 02:09:33,958
The nightscape? Which nightscape was the prettiest in Singapore?

2274
02:09:35,887 --> 02:09:39,397
We had many opportunities to go to the places that were...

2275
02:09:39,398 --> 02:09:40,858
- pretty and nice. - Yes.

2276
02:09:41,898 --> 02:09:45,028
I think I will remember coming here while talking to you on the phone.

2277
02:09:46,198 --> 02:09:47,238
That's the correct answer.

2278
02:09:49,568 --> 02:09:50,568
Gosh.

2279
02:09:52,208 --> 02:09:55,408
Had I given another answer, I would have gotten scolded.

2280
02:09:55,507 --> 02:09:56,578
I would have talked about it all my life.

2281
02:09:57,408 --> 02:09:59,618
"That nightscape? I see."

2282
02:10:00,977 --> 02:10:02,078
"Was it like that for you?"

2283
02:10:03,047 --> 02:10:04,917
And you tell me not to tease you.

2284
02:10:05,988 --> 02:10:07,658
(Staring)

2285
02:10:07,988 --> 02:10:09,057
You look pretty today.

2286
02:10:09,387 --> 02:10:10,926
Do I look okay today?

2287
02:10:10,927 --> 02:10:12,557
Yes, you look pretty. That outfit suits you.

2288
02:10:12,958 --> 02:10:13,958
(Glancing over)

2289
02:10:14,057 --> 02:10:16,726
Your condition is different from that of the woman...

2290
02:10:16,727 --> 02:10:17,868
who was lying down,

2291
02:10:17,967 --> 02:10:20,797
so it's hard for me to meet your eyes.

2292
02:10:23,307 --> 02:10:24,908
Do you know why my mom chose you?

2293
02:10:25,307 --> 02:10:26,477
Why did she choose me?

2294
02:10:26,778 --> 02:10:30,807
She liked the way you set the spoons and chopsticks...

2295
02:10:31,108 --> 02:10:32,916
- as soon as you sat down. - Really?

2296
02:10:32,917 --> 02:10:33,977
Do you know what I said?

2297
02:10:34,677 --> 02:10:35,748
I don't want to know.

2298
02:10:36,948 --> 02:10:40,016
- Okay. - I will cherish...

2299
02:10:40,017 --> 02:10:42,386
your mom's beautiful heart.

2300
02:10:42,387 --> 02:10:44,087
I was going to ruin the moment.

2301
02:10:45,028 --> 02:10:47,497
It makes me happy to hear...

2302
02:10:47,498 --> 02:10:48,858
her heartwarming words.

2303
02:10:48,958 --> 02:10:49,967
Right.

2304
02:10:51,297 --> 02:10:53,568
What did you say to her?

2305
02:10:53,998 --> 02:10:56,738
I said, "Everyone in the house does that."

2306
02:10:57,708 --> 02:11:00,037
- But I also said, - You said that we shouldn't fight.

2307
02:11:00,038 --> 02:11:02,037
"I knew that..."

2308
02:11:02,038 --> 02:11:04,177
"you would choose Yong Woo."

2309
02:11:04,578 --> 02:11:07,317
You look very dependable and kind.

2310
02:11:07,318 --> 02:11:08,717
You are talking without meeting my eye again.

2311
02:11:09,118 --> 02:11:10,148
I caught you.

2312
02:11:11,087 --> 02:11:12,788
All right, Kim Ji Won.

2313
02:11:13,688 --> 02:11:15,788
Your eyes can't lie.

2314
02:11:16,658 --> 02:11:17,886
I tend to avoid eye contact.

2315
02:11:17,887 --> 02:11:18,958
You tend to avoid eye contact.

2316
02:11:21,698 --> 02:11:23,398
I guess it was cold in Seoul.

2317
02:11:25,097 --> 02:11:27,198
It swam over.

2318
02:11:28,797 --> 02:11:29,908
It's a present.

2319
02:11:31,068 --> 02:11:32,738
Hello. It has been a while.

2320
02:11:33,977 --> 02:11:35,507
You are smart.

2321
02:11:40,248 --> 02:11:42,477
This is very nice.

2322
02:11:44,648 --> 02:11:46,118
You were going to say something.

2323
02:12:00,438 --> 02:12:02,137
What is up with that gaze?

2324
02:12:06,807 --> 02:12:08,977
It's hot.

2325
02:12:11,708 --> 02:12:13,047
It smells like you.

2326
02:12:14,377 --> 02:12:15,448
(Glancing over)

2327
02:12:15,748 --> 02:12:16,748
What?

2328
02:12:16,749 --> 02:12:17,988
(Rubbing)

2329
02:12:20,087 --> 02:12:21,417
You keep making that dolphin kiss you.

2330
02:12:26,557 --> 02:12:28,028
Do you have the ideal type?

2331
02:12:28,898 --> 02:12:30,198
- The ideal type? - Yes.

2332
02:12:30,597 --> 02:12:32,167
Someone who is close to me,

2333
02:12:32,297 --> 02:12:36,908
but who is more positive and sound than me.

2334
02:12:37,438 --> 02:12:38,467
I see.

2335
02:12:39,038 --> 02:12:41,408
In my opinion, these are your strong points.

2336
02:12:41,708 --> 02:12:43,208
You are pretty and have a way with words.

2337
02:12:44,278 --> 02:12:46,448
- You are fun. - Fun?

2338
02:12:48,278 --> 02:12:50,287
"Fun" is the word you use the most often...

2339
02:12:50,288 --> 02:12:51,788
to describe me.

2340
02:12:52,118 --> 02:12:53,417
- "Fun?" - Am I that fun?

2341
02:12:54,917 --> 02:12:56,227
Your looks are fun too.

2342
02:12:57,087 --> 02:12:59,086
I mean that in a good way.

2343
02:12:59,087 --> 02:13:00,256
- Do you mean that in a good way? - Yes.

2344
02:13:00,257 --> 02:13:01,458
Your face is fun too.

2345
02:13:03,068 --> 02:13:07,568
I felt like our hearts had become lighter.

2346
02:13:07,837 --> 02:13:09,967
We no longer cared about the things around us.

2347
02:13:10,167 --> 02:13:12,807
We were on the comfortable tempo together.

2348
02:13:18,047 --> 02:13:19,747
- They like each other so much. - Seriously.

2349
02:13:19,748 --> 02:13:22,046
I wish they had met a bit sooner.

2350
02:13:22,047 --> 02:13:23,748
- I had no idea. - That's right.

2351
02:13:24,017 --> 02:13:27,358
It's the charm of a dating show.

2352
02:13:27,917 --> 02:13:29,828
We could follow the changes in their hearts.

2353
02:13:29,988 --> 02:13:32,086
Honestly... Yong Woo changed his decision saying,

2354
02:13:32,087 --> 02:13:34,858
"I want to do what I want."

2355
02:13:35,127 --> 02:13:38,527
Then he followed his heart and achieved what he wanted.

2356
02:13:38,528 --> 02:13:40,337
- That's right. - I think it's impressive.

2357
02:14:12,127 --> 02:14:16,608
For about two days, I had emotional ups and downs.

2358
02:14:16,908 --> 02:14:20,807
If Jae Hyung doesn't give me a reaction,

2359
02:14:21,078 --> 02:14:23,547
should I stop liking him?

2360
02:14:24,648 --> 02:14:28,016
My answer was always "no."

2361
02:14:28,017 --> 02:14:29,217
Still,

2362
02:14:30,047 --> 02:14:32,017
my feelings belong to me.

2363
02:14:33,458 --> 02:14:35,617
Jae Hyung has always been the one.

2364
02:14:35,618 --> 02:14:37,587
Even now, Jae Hyung is the one.

2365
02:14:48,938 --> 02:14:51,708
(Final decision: Lee Ju Yeon chooses Park Jae Hyung)

2366
02:15:07,087 --> 02:15:09,057
I realized that I was on my way to meet Ju Yeon.

2367
02:15:13,498 --> 02:15:14,926
"Let's wrap this up well."

2368
02:15:14,927 --> 02:15:17,068
"Let's say goodbye well." I had that thought.

2369
02:15:41,087 --> 02:15:42,617
(This is Jae Hyung's number.)

2370
02:15:42,618 --> 02:15:43,988
(Call him and confess to him.)

2371
02:15:53,038 --> 02:15:55,398
(She calls Jae Hyung.)

2372
02:16:01,108 --> 02:16:02,137
Hello.

2373
02:16:03,047 --> 02:16:04,648
- Jae Hyung. - Yes?

2374
02:16:07,648 --> 02:16:08,717
Where are you?

2375
02:16:09,017 --> 02:16:11,318
I am on a terrace.

2376
02:16:11,648 --> 02:16:13,217
- A terrace? - Yes.

2377
02:16:16,658 --> 02:16:17,688
Do you remember...

2378
02:16:18,927 --> 02:16:21,858
the time I told you that you were a cool person?

2379
02:16:22,228 --> 02:16:23,267
Yes.

2380
02:16:24,868 --> 02:16:28,097
I liked that you had diverse charms.

2381
02:16:30,138 --> 02:16:31,468
You are cute too.

2382
02:16:34,708 --> 02:16:37,208
You are responsible at times.

2383
02:16:37,507 --> 02:16:38,878
You can grill meat well.

2384
02:16:42,448 --> 02:16:46,958
When I saw you focus on your inner self...

2385
02:16:47,118 --> 02:16:51,326
without getting swayed by the outside factors,

2386
02:16:51,327 --> 02:16:52,727
I learned a lot.

2387
02:16:52,728 --> 02:16:53,728
Okay.

2388
02:16:54,358 --> 02:16:55,457
My ideal type is...

2389
02:16:55,458 --> 02:16:58,028
someone I can picture a future with.

2390
02:16:59,397 --> 02:17:01,798
- Okay. - When I was with you,

2391
02:17:02,267 --> 02:17:04,438
I could picture a clear future.

2392
02:17:06,237 --> 02:17:07,477
That was...

2393
02:17:07,478 --> 02:17:09,506
(That was why I chose you.)

2394
02:17:09,507 --> 02:17:13,077
why I chose you.

2395
02:17:17,987 --> 02:17:23,228
Because I know the decision...

2396
02:17:24,327 --> 02:17:25,327
in your heart,

2397
02:17:28,058 --> 02:17:29,327
it's very disappointing.

2398
02:17:37,208 --> 02:17:39,368
But I had fun and good times.

2399
02:17:39,708 --> 02:17:41,108
- Yes. - I hope...

2400
02:17:42,708 --> 02:17:46,517
you would feel the same way about the time we spent together.

2401
02:17:47,618 --> 02:17:48,618
Okay.

2402
02:17:52,917 --> 02:17:54,218
- Okay. - That's all.

2403
02:17:56,528 --> 02:17:57,528
Okay.

2404
02:17:59,058 --> 02:18:00,558
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

2405
02:18:00,827 --> 02:18:02,657
(Jae Hyung looked after her attentively.)

2406
02:18:03,097 --> 02:18:05,097
(It was the day she discovered a new side of him.)

2407
02:18:05,327 --> 02:18:09,167
I could feel that he was mature.

2408
02:18:10,067 --> 02:18:13,478
(As time passed, she became more curious about him.)

2409
02:18:14,378 --> 02:18:16,708
(She always had fun when she was with him.)

2410
02:18:19,147 --> 02:18:21,618
(She wanted to spend every moment with him.)

2411
02:18:25,917 --> 02:18:26,958
Hold on.

2412
02:18:29,827 --> 02:18:32,628
It was nice to have many conversations with him.

2413
02:18:33,458 --> 02:18:37,166
I am thankful that you saw my good sides...

2414
02:18:37,167 --> 02:18:41,597
and thought highly of me.

2415
02:18:42,567 --> 02:18:43,737
Truthfully,

2416
02:18:44,337 --> 02:18:47,907
it was really nice to get to know you as a person.

2417
02:18:48,138 --> 02:18:49,647
I am thankful for the experience.

2418
02:18:49,978 --> 02:18:52,177
I find it precious.

2419
02:18:52,647 --> 02:18:53,647
And...

2420
02:18:56,077 --> 02:18:59,587
I want to sincerely thank you for seeing me as a good person.

2421
02:19:01,218 --> 02:19:05,188
The time we spent together...

2422
02:19:05,458 --> 02:19:07,927
will be a good memory.

2423
02:19:08,257 --> 02:19:09,497
I am glad to hear that.

2424
02:19:10,897 --> 02:19:11,897
Thank you.

2425
02:19:12,427 --> 02:19:14,198
Okay. Thank you too.

2426
02:19:14,638 --> 02:19:15,667
Okay.

2427
02:19:16,438 --> 02:19:18,267
See you around.

2428
02:19:19,038 --> 02:19:20,677
- Okay. - Okay.

2429
02:19:20,907 --> 02:19:22,708
- All right. - All right.

2430
02:19:26,917 --> 02:19:29,347
(She leaves the place first.)

2431
02:20:00,778 --> 02:20:03,347
(Jae Hyung stands for a long time.)

2432
02:21:11,448 --> 02:21:13,917
In a sense, he is in the same position now.

2433
02:21:14,118 --> 02:21:15,118
That's right.

2434
02:21:16,058 --> 02:21:17,987
- Gosh. - My heart aches.

2435
02:21:18,688 --> 02:21:20,727
Ju Yeon went through so much.

2436
02:21:20,728 --> 02:21:22,157
- I know. - It must have been hard.

2437
02:21:22,257 --> 02:21:24,597
In a sense, she is the strongest person.

2438
02:21:24,897 --> 02:21:26,368
She didn't show how hurt she was.

2439
02:21:26,597 --> 02:21:28,096
Jae Hyung is the one...

2440
02:21:28,097 --> 02:21:31,066
who has the best understanding of what Ju Yeon is going through.

2441
02:21:31,067 --> 02:21:32,236
It became that way.

2442
02:21:32,237 --> 02:21:33,278
- Yes. - Yes.

2443
02:21:33,407 --> 02:21:35,107
In a sense,

2444
02:21:35,108 --> 02:21:38,377
this experience must have helped him understand Ji Won...

2445
02:21:38,378 --> 02:21:40,517
for doing the same to him.

2446
02:21:41,917 --> 02:21:43,487
I bet it makes him sadder.

2447
02:21:47,257 --> 02:21:48,817
- It makes my heart ache. - I know.

2448
02:21:52,858 --> 02:21:54,657
- Are we the only ones here? - It seems that way.

2449
02:21:54,997 --> 02:21:56,397
- Do you want to swim? - Yes.

2450
02:21:56,698 --> 02:21:58,228
- Let's hurry up and do it. - It's electrifying.

2451
02:22:21,958 --> 02:22:22,958
What?

2452
02:22:24,728 --> 02:22:25,788
I didn't know.

2453
02:22:26,058 --> 02:22:27,058
My goodness.

2454
02:22:43,038 --> 02:22:44,778
How cool. This is fun.

2455
02:22:55,587 --> 02:22:57,628
(They move to the room.)

2456
02:22:59,827 --> 02:23:00,958
It looks like Yun Jae.

2457
02:23:03,058 --> 02:23:04,097
That's insane.

2458
02:23:05,698 --> 02:23:06,767
It does look like him.

2459
02:23:08,638 --> 02:23:10,767
I thought it looked familiar.

2460
02:23:12,567 --> 02:23:14,337
I won't be able to see it since I am short.

2461
02:23:15,308 --> 02:23:17,907
- Did you guys have a good time? - Hello.

2462
02:23:18,077 --> 02:23:20,847
- Yun Jae, did you succeed in it? - I succeeded in it.

2463
02:23:21,077 --> 02:23:22,118
That's nice to hear.

2464
02:23:22,247 --> 02:23:23,788
It's all thanks to you.

2465
02:23:24,288 --> 02:23:25,647
I left no regrets.

2466
02:23:26,118 --> 02:23:27,217
- Really? - Yes.

2467
02:23:27,218 --> 02:23:28,317
- So it's good. - Well done, Cho A.

2468
02:23:30,028 --> 02:23:31,986
Jung Sub, hang out with me.

2469
02:23:31,987 --> 02:23:32,987
Okay.

2470
02:23:37,497 --> 02:23:38,897
- Seriously. - People who date in their 20s...

2471
02:23:40,097 --> 02:23:41,198
are fresh.

2472
02:23:41,397 --> 02:23:43,037
My sister likes fresh things too.

2473
02:23:43,038 --> 02:23:45,938
This is one-sided love. I practically beg for her attention.

2474
02:23:46,067 --> 02:23:47,506
(They can't hear him.)

2475
02:23:47,507 --> 02:23:48,577
I am sorry.

2476
02:23:48,708 --> 02:23:49,878
We can't butt in.

2477
02:23:50,708 --> 02:23:51,708
We shouldn't do that.

2478
02:23:51,709 --> 02:23:52,746
I will do that.

2479
02:23:52,747 --> 02:23:53,978
- Are you going to go to bed? - Bye.

2480
02:23:54,278 --> 02:23:55,346
Bye.

2481
02:23:55,347 --> 02:23:56,347
- No way. - Bye.

2482
02:23:57,147 --> 02:23:59,688
I told you to go to bed without coming downstairs.

2483
02:23:59,788 --> 02:24:00,788
I told you to go to bed.

2484
02:24:00,858 --> 02:24:02,987
Why did you come downstairs...

2485
02:24:03,087 --> 02:24:04,687
- without going to bed? - I wasn't sleepy.

2486
02:24:04,688 --> 02:24:06,187
- What? - I wasn't sleepy.

2487
02:24:06,188 --> 02:24:07,257
Why didn't you go to bed?

2488
02:24:08,128 --> 02:24:09,297
I wasn't sleepy.

2489
02:24:09,298 --> 02:24:10,767
- Really? Are you sleepy now? - Yes.

2490
02:24:11,067 --> 02:24:12,067
(My goodness)

2491
02:24:13,468 --> 02:24:14,767
- Stop. - I can't believe it.

2492
02:24:15,798 --> 02:24:17,507
- Stop. - I can't believe it.

2493
02:24:17,837 --> 02:24:19,407
What am I seeing?

2494
02:24:20,007 --> 02:24:22,006
- Yun Jae. - This is so sudden.

2495
02:24:22,007 --> 02:24:23,977
- After the hug, - Yun Jae.

2496
02:24:23,978 --> 02:24:25,478
They became intimate very suddenly.

2497
02:24:25,647 --> 02:24:27,277
- Yun Jae said... - My goodness.

2498
02:24:27,278 --> 02:24:29,548
That he would approach her slowly.

2499
02:24:29,917 --> 02:24:32,048
- That isn't a slow approach. - I mean...

2500
02:24:32,147 --> 02:24:33,358
Is that a slow approach?

2501
02:24:34,358 --> 02:24:35,858
So normally, it's much faster than this?

2502
02:24:36,587 --> 02:24:38,327
- That might be it. - Correct.

2503
02:24:39,827 --> 02:24:40,997
My goodness.

2504
02:24:42,397 --> 02:24:44,097
(Messages arrive.)

2505
02:24:44,497 --> 02:24:49,438
(The messages that were saved last night)

2506
02:24:53,267 --> 02:24:56,378
(I won't put much meaning behind my decision tomorrow.)

2507
02:24:58,608 --> 02:24:59,778
I think it's from Ju Yeon.

2508
02:25:00,147 --> 02:25:03,387
I think it was Ju Yeon being considerate...

2509
02:25:03,388 --> 02:25:06,317
because she didn't want to pressure me.

2510
02:25:06,858 --> 02:25:08,816
I am the most thankful...

2511
02:25:08,817 --> 02:25:13,058
that you spared me time for a conversation.

2512
02:25:13,358 --> 02:25:14,427
You went through a lot.

2513
02:25:15,728 --> 02:25:18,967
(Ji Won, I understand.)

2514
02:25:18,968 --> 02:25:22,597
I didn't think that I would have time to converse with Ji Won.

2515
02:25:22,737 --> 02:25:26,166
But I could have such time and sort out my thoughts.

2516
02:25:26,167 --> 02:25:28,407
It made my heart feel light.

2517
02:25:28,808 --> 02:25:34,016
(Let's do a good job of climbing over the big mountain.)

2518
02:25:34,017 --> 02:25:38,317
When I went on dates with you, laughed merrily, and had fun,

2519
02:25:38,548 --> 02:25:40,117
I was sincere.

2520
02:25:40,118 --> 02:25:42,817
That time was filled with so much fun and happiness.

2521
02:25:42,958 --> 02:25:44,058
I will root for you.

2522
02:25:45,528 --> 02:25:47,228
I think it's from Cho A.

2523
02:25:47,628 --> 02:25:50,496
(There were times you paid attention to my every word...)

2524
02:25:50,497 --> 02:25:53,166
(and made an effort.)

2525
02:25:53,167 --> 02:25:55,538
(Thank you for helping me feel precious emotions.)

2526
02:25:55,897 --> 02:26:00,478
She said the words I wanted to say to her.

2527
02:26:00,708 --> 02:26:02,038
She is a really nice person.

2528
02:26:04,907 --> 02:26:06,847
I chose Yong Woo.

2529
02:26:07,378 --> 02:26:09,846
When time passes,

2530
02:26:09,847 --> 02:26:11,916
you will know that you made the right decision...

2531
02:26:11,917 --> 02:26:14,156
since you followed your heart.

2532
02:26:14,157 --> 02:26:15,217
That's right.

2533
02:26:15,218 --> 02:26:17,527
I didn't think about what people would say.

2534
02:26:17,528 --> 02:26:19,027
"Would I seem like a loser?"

2535
02:26:19,028 --> 02:26:20,227
"Would I seem like someone who lacks self-esteem?"

2536
02:26:20,228 --> 02:26:21,458
Without having those thoughts,

2537
02:26:21,958 --> 02:26:23,198
I said what I wanted to say.

2538
02:26:24,528 --> 02:26:28,066
During the three-week experience,

2539
02:26:28,067 --> 02:26:30,937
there were some things I gained.

2540
02:26:30,938 --> 02:26:35,208
I made unforgettable memories with Cheol Hyeon.

2541
02:26:35,378 --> 02:26:38,277
The experience of sharing everything...

2542
02:26:38,278 --> 02:26:41,817
and conversing with my brother was nice.

2543
02:26:42,048 --> 02:26:43,646
Without any filters,

2544
02:26:43,647 --> 02:26:47,316
I could stay true to my emotions.

2545
02:26:47,317 --> 02:26:49,656
I loved it so much that I wondered...

2546
02:26:49,657 --> 02:26:51,787
such a moment would come again.

2547
02:26:51,788 --> 02:26:56,228
And the next thing is something I have always wanted.

2548
02:26:56,358 --> 02:26:58,666
When I came home after work,

2549
02:26:58,667 --> 02:27:00,666
people welcomed me.

2550
02:27:00,667 --> 02:27:04,507
That warmth was the most memorable.

2551
02:27:04,737 --> 02:27:05,807
It's Cho A.

2552
02:27:05,808 --> 02:27:07,038
(It's me.)

2553
02:27:07,378 --> 02:27:11,076
(- Did you have dinner? - No, I didn't.)

2554
02:27:11,077 --> 02:27:12,877
(I can't let you be hungry.)

2555
02:27:12,878 --> 02:27:14,247
(I am back.)

2556
02:27:15,618 --> 02:27:16,618
(I love Cho A.)

2557
02:27:16,619 --> 02:27:18,048
(Why are you welcoming me so warmly?)

2558
02:27:19,587 --> 02:27:21,517
(I am back.)

2559
02:27:21,757 --> 02:27:23,256
(Why isn't Cho A coming down?)

2560
02:27:23,257 --> 02:27:24,326
(She needs to eat.)

2561
02:27:24,327 --> 02:27:26,128
(Cho A, hurry up and eat.)

2562
02:27:26,427 --> 02:27:28,127
(Hurry up and eat.)

2563
02:27:28,128 --> 02:27:29,597
(Cho A, come and eat.)

2564
02:27:29,897 --> 02:27:32,798
(I feel so fascinated when I see Cho A eat well.)

2565
02:27:33,327 --> 02:27:34,336
Why do you eat well these days?

2566
02:27:34,337 --> 02:27:35,836
(I didn't have time to eat before.)

2567
02:27:35,837 --> 02:27:38,807
It was nice to talk to people...

2568
02:27:38,808 --> 02:27:42,077
in the other room if I had a worry.

2569
02:27:42,378 --> 02:27:44,208
(It isn't over yet.)

2570
02:27:44,407 --> 02:27:46,307
(Why do I feel like it's over?)

2571
02:27:46,308 --> 02:27:48,147
(It isn't over until it is.)

2572
02:27:48,347 --> 02:27:49,717
(I am like you, Se Seung.)

2573
02:27:49,718 --> 02:27:52,147
(I keep wanting to check.)

2574
02:27:52,347 --> 02:27:53,656
Are you okay?

2575
02:27:53,657 --> 02:27:57,426
Yesterday, I wasn't okay. I hated him too.

2576
02:27:57,427 --> 02:27:58,628
- It's understandable. - Yes.

2577
02:27:58,927 --> 02:28:00,897
(House after the final decision)

2578
02:28:01,257 --> 02:28:03,567
Men make up half of the population in the world.

2579
02:28:03,968 --> 02:28:04,997
That's right.

2580
02:28:05,327 --> 02:28:07,897
I will bring you an honest and hardworking man.

2581
02:28:09,567 --> 02:28:12,207
I am worried that I am on my desperate mode.

2582
02:28:12,208 --> 02:28:14,608
Desperate mode, my foot. You are being sincere.

2583
02:28:15,138 --> 02:28:18,548
You are incredible for letting go and relaying what's in your heart.

2584
02:28:18,778 --> 02:28:21,916
When someone asked me if I wanted a big family...

2585
02:28:21,917 --> 02:28:25,717
or a small family in childhood,

2586
02:28:25,718 --> 02:28:28,117
I said that I wanted a big family...

2587
02:28:28,118 --> 02:28:30,826
in my life.

2588
02:28:30,827 --> 02:28:33,527
But I lived my life suppressing...

2589
02:28:33,528 --> 02:28:35,496
such desires.

2590
02:28:35,497 --> 02:28:38,197
"A solitary lifestyle suits me."

2591
02:28:38,198 --> 02:28:40,496
"Being with other people..."

2592
02:28:40,497 --> 02:28:43,138
"makes me uncomfortable." I had that thought.

2593
02:28:43,468 --> 02:28:44,766
(I guess I was the type...)

2594
02:28:44,767 --> 02:28:49,006
(- who suits a bustling house. - Do you feel comfortable?)

2595
02:28:49,007 --> 02:28:50,576
(I guess I was that kind of a person.)

2596
02:28:50,577 --> 02:28:52,107
When I woke up in the morning, people asked,

2597
02:28:52,108 --> 02:28:53,406
"Did you sleep well? Did you have breakfast?"

2598
02:28:53,407 --> 02:28:54,618
Then we ate together.

2599
02:28:54,878 --> 02:28:57,288
(- Did you sleep well? - Yes, I slept well.)

2600
02:28:57,417 --> 02:29:00,256
I already feel sad about parting ways...

2601
02:29:00,257 --> 02:29:02,357
with these people.

2602
02:29:02,358 --> 02:29:04,887
I already thought about how I would miss them.

2603
02:29:04,888 --> 02:29:07,326
That hunch has never been proven wrong.

2604
02:29:07,327 --> 02:29:10,266
The hunch that I will miss someone.

2605
02:29:10,267 --> 02:29:12,996
I realized once again that I was someone...

2606
02:29:12,997 --> 02:29:16,236
who needed other people to eat with...

2607
02:29:16,237 --> 02:29:17,337
and converse with.

2608
02:29:17,708 --> 02:29:20,307
"There are many heartwarming people who resemble me."

2609
02:29:20,308 --> 02:29:21,708
I had that thought too.

2610
02:29:21,907 --> 02:29:24,077
You aren't struggling emotionally, are you?

2611
02:29:24,208 --> 02:29:26,278
You seem to be down these days.

2612
02:29:26,448 --> 02:29:27,877
Let's have a hug.

2613
02:29:27,878 --> 02:29:28,917
All right.

2614
02:29:33,688 --> 02:29:35,888
Cheol Hyeon, did you apply sunscreen?

2615
02:29:36,358 --> 02:29:37,527
No, I didn't.

2616
02:29:37,528 --> 02:29:38,887
You should soak in the sun after applying sunscreen.

2617
02:29:38,888 --> 02:29:40,798
UV rays are dangerous these days.

2618
02:29:40,958 --> 02:29:44,298
When we open this door and enter, we see our friends.

2619
02:29:44,427 --> 02:29:47,837
Hearing them talk among themselves...

2620
02:29:48,638 --> 02:29:51,237
I like it. I can feel warmth.

2621
02:29:51,538 --> 02:29:54,176
Various emotions came back to me.

2622
02:29:54,177 --> 02:29:56,438
Many emotions got healed.

2623
02:29:58,208 --> 02:30:02,017
In a sense, it scares me.

2624
02:30:05,118 --> 02:30:07,718
To be honest, it's very scary.

2625
02:30:07,917 --> 02:30:11,156
Before coming to Singapore, I dropped by at my place...

2626
02:30:11,157 --> 02:30:13,358
to retrieve some summer clothes.

2627
02:30:13,897 --> 02:30:16,156
"This place is so empty. I hate it."

2628
02:30:16,157 --> 02:30:18,468
I had such thoughts.

2629
02:30:18,528 --> 02:30:21,798
Once I leave this place,

2630
02:30:22,138 --> 02:30:24,666
these emotions will visit me...

2631
02:30:24,667 --> 02:30:26,638
from time to time. That's what I find scary.

2632
02:30:26,808 --> 02:30:29,808
All of these people were great.

2633
02:30:31,177 --> 02:30:34,618
Yes. So I think that the aftereffect will be hard.

2634
02:30:35,017 --> 02:30:36,778
I feel new emotions.

2635
02:30:37,247 --> 02:30:40,688
I feel like I revived the emotions...

2636
02:30:40,817 --> 02:30:43,587
I had forgotten about.

2637
02:30:43,858 --> 02:30:45,256
I feel the same.

2638
02:30:45,257 --> 02:30:47,996
I don't want to wake up from this dream.

2639
02:30:47,997 --> 02:30:51,197
I am both extremely pained and extremely happy.

2640
02:30:51,198 --> 02:30:52,228
Those sides...

2641
02:30:53,067 --> 02:30:54,067
coexist.

2642
02:30:54,167 --> 02:30:58,667
Cheol Hyeon, I think I could be here...

2643
02:30:58,968 --> 02:31:02,638
because you were with me.

2644
02:31:02,837 --> 02:31:07,147
I hope you would cherish these good memories.

2645
02:31:07,218 --> 02:31:10,718
Cho A, you are a very pretty person.

2646
02:31:10,888 --> 02:31:13,086
Your charms are endless.

2647
02:31:13,087 --> 02:31:14,787
You shouldn't be bothered...

2648
02:31:14,788 --> 02:31:16,288
by the pain you suffered.

2649
02:31:16,487 --> 02:31:18,086
You have me, your younger brother.

2650
02:31:18,087 --> 02:31:20,087
So lean on me a lot.

2651
02:31:20,257 --> 02:31:22,827
I hope you would believe in yourself.

2652
02:31:23,028 --> 02:31:24,097
I love you.

2653
02:31:25,128 --> 02:31:28,797
Cheol Hyeon and Cho A are such warmhearted people.

2654
02:31:28,798 --> 02:31:31,267
- That's right. - They are so warmhearted.

2655
02:31:32,007 --> 02:31:34,007
I really felt...

2656
02:31:34,177 --> 02:31:37,777
how precious my older sister and my family members were.

2657
02:31:37,778 --> 02:31:41,278
Seriously. I miss them so much.

2658
02:31:41,847 --> 02:31:43,346
- Jung Sub. - Really?

2659
02:31:43,347 --> 02:31:45,246
And there were many moments...

2660
02:31:45,247 --> 02:31:48,317
in which we reminded each other of that fact.

2661
02:31:48,558 --> 02:31:51,058
In my eyes, you are the best.

2662
02:31:51,228 --> 02:31:53,826
I think my life is complete...

2663
02:31:53,827 --> 02:31:56,657
because I have you, Yun Ha.

2664
02:31:56,897 --> 02:32:00,367
You are the person I respect the most.

2665
02:32:00,368 --> 02:32:02,337
I really love you a lot.

2666
02:32:02,968 --> 02:32:06,307
I only thought of him as a young brother.

2667
02:32:06,308 --> 02:32:07,637
It must have been hard.

2668
02:32:07,638 --> 02:32:09,608
You can do better from now on.

2669
02:32:09,737 --> 02:32:11,807
But he mingled well with the others.

2670
02:32:11,808 --> 02:32:14,218
Seeing how much other people liked him...

2671
02:32:14,347 --> 02:32:16,977
made me proud as a sister.

2672
02:32:16,978 --> 02:32:19,448
"My younger brother is the best."

2673
02:32:19,788 --> 02:32:21,586
(To Se Seung)

2674
02:32:21,587 --> 02:32:22,688
Se Seung,

2675
02:32:22,757 --> 02:32:26,288
my younger brother is like the AI. He lacks in many ways.

2676
02:32:26,558 --> 02:32:29,426
But I would be grateful...

2677
02:32:29,427 --> 02:32:32,368
if you could please be more understanding.

2678
02:32:32,528 --> 02:32:33,897
Yun Ha, I love you.

2679
02:32:35,737 --> 02:32:37,667
I like Jung Sub so much.

2680
02:32:38,208 --> 02:32:39,507
Why do I like him so much?

2681
02:32:39,638 --> 02:32:42,878
It's fascinating. I feel like I am in my early 20s.

2682
02:32:43,638 --> 02:32:46,677
I just like Jung Sub a lot.

2683
02:32:46,878 --> 02:32:48,077
I became a fan.

2684
02:32:49,917 --> 02:32:53,016
Entering the show was a big challenge for me.

2685
02:32:53,017 --> 02:32:55,316
While filming the show,

2686
02:32:55,317 --> 02:32:57,558
I could challenge myself nonstop.

2687
02:32:57,757 --> 02:32:59,887
It was the same for my emotions of love.

2688
02:32:59,888 --> 02:33:02,227
I could grow once more.

2689
02:33:02,228 --> 02:33:04,968
Just like how things were in our childhood,

2690
02:33:05,897 --> 02:33:07,468
Jung Sub and I could do something together.

2691
02:33:08,267 --> 02:33:10,708
I do want you to be more prudent.

2692
02:33:10,868 --> 02:33:13,236
We talked a lot.

2693
02:33:13,237 --> 02:33:15,108
Such memories...

2694
02:33:15,407 --> 02:33:17,346
make me very thankful.

2695
02:33:17,347 --> 02:33:21,677
I realized that I wanted to go back to how things were in the past.

2696
02:33:22,048 --> 02:33:23,077
Thank you.

2697
02:33:26,087 --> 02:33:27,087
Thanks.

2698
02:33:28,858 --> 02:33:30,387
I thought that...

2699
02:33:30,388 --> 02:33:34,257
this experience was like my finger.

2700
02:33:34,397 --> 02:33:36,997
I got hurt as soon as I joined.

2701
02:33:39,097 --> 02:33:41,166
Toward the end of the shoot,

2702
02:33:41,167 --> 02:33:42,736
my bones were healed...

2703
02:33:42,737 --> 02:33:45,166
and I could move my finger with ease.

2704
02:33:45,167 --> 02:33:48,277
There were various problems...

2705
02:33:48,278 --> 02:33:50,308
I couldn't face.

2706
02:33:50,577 --> 02:33:53,177
I could face those problems and solve them.

2707
02:33:53,478 --> 02:33:55,717
My younger sister and I tended to get along,

2708
02:33:55,718 --> 02:33:57,547
but I mostly nagged at her.

2709
02:33:57,548 --> 02:34:00,147
I rarely said kind words to her.

2710
02:34:00,288 --> 02:34:01,916
(You can't pick someone just for the sake of the selection.)

2711
02:34:01,917 --> 02:34:03,517
(That's right.)

2712
02:34:03,757 --> 02:34:04,926
(You are eloquent.)

2713
02:34:04,927 --> 02:34:06,057
Through this experience,

2714
02:34:06,058 --> 02:34:07,958
I could listen to my sister's thoughts.

2715
02:34:08,058 --> 02:34:11,798
I think there were many gains.

2716
02:34:13,298 --> 02:34:14,337
How did it go?

2717
02:34:17,868 --> 02:34:20,266
That's hilarious.

2718
02:34:20,267 --> 02:34:22,406
In a sense,

2719
02:34:22,407 --> 02:34:25,307
I entered the show with excitement.

2720
02:34:25,308 --> 02:34:26,777
I came here...

2721
02:34:26,778 --> 02:34:29,346
expecting to have a lot of fun.

2722
02:34:29,347 --> 02:34:31,388
But as time went on,

2723
02:34:31,548 --> 02:34:35,188
I learned a lot about myself.

2724
02:34:35,358 --> 02:34:37,986
I faced the side of me...

2725
02:34:37,987 --> 02:34:39,558
I had buried deep.

2726
02:34:40,157 --> 02:34:42,757
"Yong Woo was a child who liked books."

2727
02:34:45,067 --> 02:34:47,066
- Read it slowly. - It's okay.

2728
02:34:47,067 --> 02:34:48,667
- It isn't as easy as I thought. - I know.

2729
02:34:48,897 --> 02:34:52,368
"He has a charm that makes other people happy..."

2730
02:34:53,208 --> 02:34:54,278
"when he is with them."

2731
02:34:54,538 --> 02:34:58,108
During that process, I became closer to Ju Yeon.

2732
02:34:58,708 --> 02:34:59,847
I won't be able to forget it.

2733
02:35:00,917 --> 02:35:04,788
I will stop trying to take care of everything alone...

2734
02:35:05,147 --> 02:35:08,157
and share my burden with my family and friends.

2735
02:35:08,358 --> 02:35:11,926
(During our time together, I learned a lot about myself.)

2736
02:35:11,927 --> 02:35:16,057
(I want to change now.)

2737
02:35:16,058 --> 02:35:19,597
(I think it will be better that way.)

2738
02:35:20,397 --> 02:35:22,996
I want to become someone who can open up...

2739
02:35:22,997 --> 02:35:24,736
more easily.

2740
02:35:24,737 --> 02:35:27,108
I think it will be best for everyone.

2741
02:35:27,267 --> 02:35:28,807
I had never seen him cry...

2742
02:35:28,808 --> 02:35:30,907
so often in my life.

2743
02:35:31,808 --> 02:35:34,047
I think my brother had a therapeutic time...

2744
02:35:34,048 --> 02:35:36,347
by starring in this show.

2745
02:35:36,548 --> 02:35:38,847
I am the most thankful for that matter.

2746
02:35:39,118 --> 02:35:40,547
He had buried...

2747
02:35:40,548 --> 02:35:43,487
the wound from his childhood that wasn't healed properly.

2748
02:35:43,618 --> 02:35:45,557
He opened up...

2749
02:35:45,558 --> 02:35:47,557
and tended to his wound.

2750
02:35:47,558 --> 02:35:49,027
"Why doesn't it make Mom angry?"

2751
02:35:49,028 --> 02:35:50,798
I couldn't believe it.

2752
02:35:52,128 --> 02:35:54,867
I think that was why...

2753
02:35:54,868 --> 02:35:57,468
my brother kept showing tears.

2754
02:35:57,808 --> 02:35:59,937
I think you are especially showing...

2755
02:35:59,938 --> 02:36:02,037
- your new sides here. - Here? You are right.

2756
02:36:02,038 --> 02:36:03,877
What do you think of those sides?

2757
02:36:03,878 --> 02:36:05,448
I think they are nice.

2758
02:36:06,007 --> 02:36:08,146
Everyone needs a way to relieve his or her stress.

2759
02:36:08,147 --> 02:36:09,218
You are right.

2760
02:36:09,347 --> 02:36:12,817
You always bottled things up.

2761
02:36:13,288 --> 02:36:15,156
Suddenly, I opened up.

2762
02:36:15,157 --> 02:36:17,058
And your wound was festered.

2763
02:36:17,157 --> 02:36:18,656
It was festered.

2764
02:36:18,657 --> 02:36:20,826
And opening up had to result in...

2765
02:36:20,827 --> 02:36:22,327
- Tears. - Yes.

2766
02:36:22,657 --> 02:36:24,467
- It brought the tears. - Seriously.

2767
02:36:24,468 --> 02:36:27,467
I truly want him to open up...

2768
02:36:27,468 --> 02:36:28,868
in his life.

2769
02:36:29,138 --> 02:36:30,267
Let's live well.

2770
02:36:31,708 --> 02:36:35,038
You must have been hurt, but that isn't the end.

2771
02:36:35,308 --> 02:36:36,978
You need to overcome it.

2772
02:36:37,077 --> 02:36:39,646
As the wound heals, you will grow.

2773
02:36:39,647 --> 02:36:41,516
It seems like you had a good experience,

2774
02:36:41,517 --> 02:36:42,718
so I am happy.

2775
02:36:42,917 --> 02:36:44,548
Let's go home and meet Mom.

2776
02:36:46,888 --> 02:36:48,457
- Hello. - You finally came back.

2777
02:36:48,458 --> 02:36:51,256
What took you so long?

2778
02:36:51,257 --> 02:36:52,357
Did you have a good time?

2779
02:36:52,358 --> 02:36:53,358
- Yes. - Yes.

2780
02:36:53,558 --> 02:36:55,198
(Peek-a-boo)

2781
02:36:56,458 --> 02:36:58,266
- Is he alone? - I think he is alone.

2782
02:36:58,267 --> 02:36:59,298
What is he doing alone?

2783
02:36:59,427 --> 02:37:00,497
Did you have a good date?

2784
02:37:01,198 --> 02:37:02,267
How about the decision?

2785
02:37:02,337 --> 02:37:03,566
(Nodding)

2786
02:37:03,567 --> 02:37:05,767
Did the two of you become the final couple as well?

2787
02:37:07,407 --> 02:37:10,708
To be honest, Yun Jae played a big role.

2788
02:37:11,378 --> 02:37:13,447
We live away from our parents.

2789
02:37:13,448 --> 02:37:18,746
Although our parents were proud of us,

2790
02:37:18,747 --> 02:37:20,717
they didn't have a chance...

2791
02:37:20,718 --> 02:37:23,558
to see how our daily lives went.

2792
02:37:23,788 --> 02:37:27,057
Through this show, they will be able to see it.

2793
02:37:27,058 --> 02:37:29,996
I told myself, "There is nothing more I want."

2794
02:37:29,997 --> 02:37:34,597
But the pent-up frustration I had all my life toward my brother...

2795
02:37:35,267 --> 02:37:37,868
got dug up as well.

2796
02:37:38,337 --> 02:37:41,307
(Seoul, after Yun Jae joined)

2797
02:37:41,308 --> 02:37:42,937
To be honest, I don't get it.

2798
02:37:42,938 --> 02:37:44,207
You have no interest.

2799
02:37:44,208 --> 02:37:46,377
Even now, you only talk about yourself.

2800
02:37:46,378 --> 02:37:47,747
But I think...

2801
02:37:48,317 --> 02:37:50,417
I don't want to have this conversation.

2802
02:37:54,048 --> 02:37:56,788
To be honest, we weren't very close.

2803
02:37:56,987 --> 02:38:00,727
Ji Won and I didn't call each other often.

2804
02:38:00,728 --> 02:38:02,096
We didn't know about each other's emotions.

2805
02:38:02,097 --> 02:38:04,797
I realized this once more. Ji Won and I are...

2806
02:38:04,798 --> 02:38:07,297
very generous toward other people,

2807
02:38:07,298 --> 02:38:09,897
but very cool headed toward each other.

2808
02:38:10,497 --> 02:38:12,707
Whenever I cried because of my brother,

2809
02:38:12,708 --> 02:38:16,907
there was always some resentment.

2810
02:38:17,177 --> 02:38:20,377
"Why is Yun Jae only like that to us?"

2811
02:38:20,378 --> 02:38:23,218
Mom and I said that from time to time.

2812
02:38:23,347 --> 02:38:24,887
But while filming,

2813
02:38:24,888 --> 02:38:26,646
I could see...

2814
02:38:26,647 --> 02:38:31,027
why he wanted to treat other people better than us...

2815
02:38:31,028 --> 02:38:33,157
and where that desire came from.

2816
02:38:33,288 --> 02:38:36,757
I could feel it during our everyday lives.

2817
02:38:37,228 --> 02:38:40,698
(Yun Jae always made meals for other people.)

2818
02:38:41,868 --> 02:38:44,167
(I will enjoy the food. Thank you so much.)

2819
02:38:44,608 --> 02:38:46,467
(Gosh, it's so tasty.)

2820
02:38:46,468 --> 02:38:47,807
(It's so tasty.)

2821
02:38:47,808 --> 02:38:49,907
(You should compliment your brother a lot.)

2822
02:38:51,007 --> 02:38:54,817
Other people were very thankful for the small things.

2823
02:38:55,077 --> 02:38:57,986
They thought highly of him and saw him as a cool man.

2824
02:38:57,987 --> 02:39:01,157
(Yun Jae is incredible at housekeeping.)

2825
02:39:01,317 --> 02:39:02,717
(What would we have done without Yun Jae?)

2826
02:39:02,718 --> 02:39:03,917
(I know. Seriously.)

2827
02:39:04,487 --> 02:39:07,457
(Ji Won, please say something when we praise Yun Jae.)

2828
02:39:07,458 --> 02:39:11,267
(You don't know that I always clean up after Yun Jae.)

2829
02:39:12,497 --> 02:39:13,497
(See?)

2830
02:39:13,567 --> 02:39:15,798
(We don't thank each other.)

2831
02:39:17,138 --> 02:39:19,407
In that sense,

2832
02:39:20,138 --> 02:39:22,407
I didn't treat Yun Jae as other people treated him.

2833
02:39:22,837 --> 02:39:25,107
"Yun Jae, how did you do this? You are really cool."

2834
02:39:25,108 --> 02:39:27,547
"How did you do it so well? Thank you so much."

2835
02:39:27,548 --> 02:39:30,917
He didn't often get to hear those words from me.

2836
02:39:31,817 --> 02:39:34,486
So looking after me...

2837
02:39:34,487 --> 02:39:36,987
couldn't have been...

2838
02:39:37,388 --> 02:39:40,188
a rewarding experience for my brother.

2839
02:39:41,228 --> 02:39:43,298
I came to understand my brother a lot.

2840
02:39:44,897 --> 02:39:46,597
After Mom became sick,

2841
02:39:47,167 --> 02:39:49,297
I had a lot of fear about being left in the world...

2842
02:39:49,298 --> 02:39:50,737
alone with my brother.

2843
02:39:51,067 --> 02:39:53,207
"How will we manage by ourselves without Mom?"

2844
02:39:53,208 --> 02:39:54,737
"How will we live?"

2845
02:39:55,108 --> 02:39:58,378
I think I found an answer to those questions.

2846
02:40:00,548 --> 02:40:04,487
I think it was a very important time...

2847
02:40:05,017 --> 02:40:06,548
in my life.

2848
02:40:10,458 --> 02:40:11,458
What?

2849
02:40:11,459 --> 02:40:13,358
Why are you wearing so much makeup?

2850
02:40:13,657 --> 02:40:14,798
Open your eyes wide.

2851
02:40:15,198 --> 02:40:16,628
I am opening them as wide as I can.

2852
02:40:18,667 --> 02:40:19,926
Can you pronounce the words properly?

2853
02:40:19,927 --> 02:40:20,997
Say, "This way."

2854
02:40:21,298 --> 02:40:22,968
I will watch you on my own.

2855
02:40:23,067 --> 02:40:24,197
I hope...

2856
02:40:24,198 --> 02:40:26,667
you would express yourself to me.

2857
02:40:27,138 --> 02:40:28,708
Ji Won.

2858
02:40:29,638 --> 02:40:32,278
It seems like I hurt your feelings a lot.

2859
02:40:32,647 --> 02:40:36,147
From now on, I will use nicer words.

2860
02:40:36,978 --> 02:40:40,788
'Why doesn't he treat me as nicely as he treats the others?"

2861
02:40:41,058 --> 02:40:43,317
I had that thought.

2862
02:40:44,688 --> 02:40:47,997
But I also didn't thank you...

2863
02:40:48,257 --> 02:40:50,157
as often as the others.

2864
02:40:50,427 --> 02:40:52,227
I felt bad...

2865
02:40:52,228 --> 02:40:57,067
because I didn't see your good sides like the others.

2866
02:40:57,638 --> 02:41:01,736
I hope we would become siblings who appreciate each other...

2867
02:41:01,737 --> 02:41:03,577
like the others from now on.

2868
02:41:04,177 --> 02:41:06,447
Yong Woo, I personally hope...

2869
02:41:06,448 --> 02:41:08,717
you would help Ji Won a lot...

2870
02:41:08,718 --> 02:41:09,917
so that she could lean on you.

2871
02:41:10,247 --> 02:41:11,448
Please take good care of her.

2872
02:41:13,247 --> 02:41:16,057
When would I get another chance to lie down in the sea?

2873
02:41:16,058 --> 02:41:17,058
Seriously.

2874
02:41:17,317 --> 02:41:18,688
Shall we take a double-chin selfie?

2875
02:41:19,388 --> 02:41:20,657
One, two, three.

2876
02:41:21,157 --> 02:41:23,197
- It's nice. - Seriously.

2877
02:41:23,198 --> 02:41:24,198
- Yong Woo. - What?

2878
02:41:24,597 --> 02:41:26,897
I wanted a photo with the both of us.

2879
02:41:27,028 --> 02:41:28,167
It is a photo with the both of us.

2880
02:41:28,698 --> 02:41:29,897
You are in the frame.

2881
02:41:32,108 --> 02:41:33,208
You are so funny.

2882
02:41:33,868 --> 02:41:34,907
Do you want to hold hands?

2883
02:41:35,608 --> 02:41:36,638
Shall we hold hands?

2884
02:41:37,577 --> 02:41:38,978
(Lost)

2885
02:41:39,577 --> 02:41:41,647
- It's the other way. - I mean...

2886
02:41:43,218 --> 02:41:44,247
Like this.

2887
02:41:45,188 --> 02:41:47,147
- I guess you have held many hands. - What?

2888
02:41:47,247 --> 02:41:49,417
Didn't you see how lost I was?

2889
02:41:50,388 --> 02:41:52,787
It's our third time visiting the sea together.

2890
02:41:52,788 --> 02:41:54,627
You know, it's really fascinating.

2891
02:41:54,628 --> 02:41:56,327
You were with me all three times.

2892
02:41:56,427 --> 02:41:57,597
- I know. - Jebu Island.

2893
02:41:58,267 --> 02:42:00,298
- Gangwon Province. Here. - Yes.

2894
02:42:00,868 --> 02:42:01,897
That's right.

2895
02:42:01,997 --> 02:42:03,138
It's nice.

2896
02:42:04,907 --> 02:42:05,938
It's nice.

2897
02:42:06,608 --> 02:42:07,608
- Yong Woo. - Yes?

2898
02:42:14,747 --> 02:42:15,978
Jung Sub.

2899
02:42:16,177 --> 02:42:18,087
One, two, three.

2900
02:42:30,157 --> 02:42:31,597
These are my pet bubbles.

2901
02:42:31,698 --> 02:42:32,868
You are good at making them.

2902
02:42:34,067 --> 02:42:35,067
Where are you now?

2903
02:42:36,198 --> 02:42:38,567
Somewhere between the reality and wonderland.

2904
02:42:39,108 --> 02:42:40,108
Same here.

2905
02:42:41,407 --> 02:42:44,378
- Wonderland. - It's totally the wonderland.

2906
02:42:47,308 --> 02:42:48,378
It's really fascinating.

2907
02:42:55,118 --> 02:42:56,817
- It's really pretty. - It's really fascinating.

2908
02:42:57,358 --> 02:42:58,487
You are really good.

2909
02:43:05,628 --> 02:43:06,698
It looks fun.

2910
02:43:10,167 --> 02:43:11,608
What? How should I take the photo?

2911
02:43:12,237 --> 02:43:14,138
- That isn't the right angle. - No?

2912
02:43:17,507 --> 02:43:18,708
It's good as long as you look pretty in it.

2913
02:43:19,647 --> 02:43:21,077
No, don't hold it there.

2914
02:43:21,177 --> 02:43:23,416
Hold it here.

2915
02:43:23,417 --> 02:43:24,917
That's it.

2916
02:43:26,517 --> 02:43:27,618
Is that it?

2917
02:43:28,417 --> 02:43:29,417
We were there.

2918
02:43:29,418 --> 02:43:32,358
The Merlion... What was it called?

2919
02:44:08,897 --> 02:44:09,897
Are you happy?

2920
02:44:12,968 --> 02:44:17,096
Jung Sub always asks, "What do you talk about with Yun Jae?"

2921
02:44:17,097 --> 02:44:20,167
I go, "We don't talk much."

2922
02:44:21,808 --> 02:44:22,907
We don't need to talk much.

2923
02:44:23,878 --> 02:44:25,608
I kill time by looking at you.

2924
02:44:54,608 --> 02:44:56,337
You are enjoying yourself, right?

2925
02:44:57,407 --> 02:45:00,278
The shoot is an excuse for physical affection.

2926
02:45:01,577 --> 02:45:03,317
That's right. I am using an excuse for physical affection.

2927
02:45:03,548 --> 02:45:04,548
You should get used to it.

2928
02:45:05,247 --> 02:45:06,517
You have too much advantage.

2929
02:45:06,847 --> 02:45:07,847
I will do it even more after filming.

2930
02:45:12,487 --> 02:45:14,087
You are insane.

2931
02:45:18,167 --> 02:45:20,298
You disarm me.

2932
02:45:47,927 --> 02:45:49,027
Aren't those photos recent?

2933
02:45:49,028 --> 02:45:51,027
I guess they are still dating well.

2934
02:45:51,028 --> 02:45:53,267
- Gosh, they wore school uniforms. - My goodness.

2935
02:46:05,747 --> 02:46:06,747
My goodness.

2936
02:46:07,108 --> 02:46:08,978
- They are the real deal. - I mean...

2937
02:46:09,147 --> 02:46:10,378
This is real romance.

2938
02:46:10,817 --> 02:46:11,817
- Gosh. - Of course.

2939
02:46:13,218 --> 02:46:14,548
It's a birthday vlog.

2940
02:46:17,417 --> 02:46:18,688
I need to message Jung Sub back.

2941
02:46:19,987 --> 02:46:21,827
Jung Sub messaged him.

2942
02:46:23,198 --> 02:46:25,128
How are you feeling on your birthday?

2943
02:46:27,698 --> 02:46:29,698
You can't multi-task.

2944
02:46:35,778 --> 02:46:38,107
It's so pretty.

2945
02:46:38,108 --> 02:46:40,478
- What do you think? Is it cool? - It's cool.

2946
02:46:41,177 --> 02:46:42,218
Thank you.

2947
02:46:46,317 --> 02:46:49,156
- Gosh, they are so sweet. - It's so nice.

2948
02:46:49,157 --> 02:46:50,888
- My goodness. - It's the best.

2949
02:46:52,188 --> 02:46:53,357
Everyone.

2950
02:46:53,358 --> 02:46:54,896
- I am so sad that it ended. - Finally,

2951
02:46:54,897 --> 02:46:58,427
the journey of My Sibling's Romance came to an end.

2952
02:46:59,028 --> 02:47:01,166
- Everyone worked hard. - Thank you for your hard work.

2953
02:47:01,167 --> 02:47:03,467
How did it feel to join My Sibling's Romance?

2954
02:47:03,468 --> 02:47:05,836
It was so nice to hear the words...

2955
02:47:05,837 --> 02:47:08,077
I needed to hear as well.

2956
02:47:08,177 --> 02:47:11,548
The title is My Sibling's Romance. If I were to focus on romance.

2957
02:47:11,878 --> 02:47:13,547
I could see...

2958
02:47:13,548 --> 02:47:16,217
that it really isn't easy for a couple to be born.

2959
02:47:16,218 --> 02:47:17,547
- That's right. - I had that thought.

2960
02:47:17,548 --> 02:47:19,086
If I were to focus on the siblings,

2961
02:47:19,087 --> 02:47:21,048
we sometimes saw them fight.

2962
02:47:21,147 --> 02:47:22,317
It made me think,

2963
02:47:22,417 --> 02:47:24,887
"I should yield to my sister."

2964
02:47:24,888 --> 02:47:26,688
- That's right. - I had that thought.

2965
02:47:26,788 --> 02:47:29,558
I became closer to my younger sister through My Sibling's Romance.

2966
02:47:30,198 --> 02:47:32,897
Yes. I could feel how precious she was.

2967
02:47:33,198 --> 02:47:36,368
I am sure things were hard for all ten participants.

2968
02:47:36,468 --> 02:47:39,137
But they opened up completely.

2969
02:47:39,138 --> 02:47:40,468
Thank you so much.

2970
02:47:40,667 --> 02:47:43,307
While hosting this show,

2971
02:47:43,308 --> 02:47:46,107
I became so absorbed in the participants' stories.

2972
02:47:46,108 --> 02:47:47,447
It was my first time doing that.

2973
02:47:47,448 --> 02:47:50,646
I became desperate along with the participants.

2974
02:47:50,647 --> 02:47:53,817
It was like reading a book.

2975
02:47:54,247 --> 02:47:55,816
Watching them gave me this lesson.

2976
02:47:55,817 --> 02:47:59,288
I should do my absolute best when I get a chance.

2977
02:48:00,188 --> 02:48:02,157
I plan to do my best.

2978
02:48:02,257 --> 02:48:04,127
So that we could follow their emotions,

2979
02:48:04,128 --> 02:48:05,927
they opened up with honesty.

2980
02:48:06,028 --> 02:48:07,967
They made us feel many things.

2981
02:48:07,968 --> 02:48:09,666
First and foremost,

2982
02:48:09,667 --> 02:48:12,308
I want to thank the participants.

2983
02:48:12,407 --> 02:48:13,808
And I am the most thankful...

2984
02:48:13,907 --> 02:48:17,477
for those who looked kindly upon the participants,

2985
02:48:17,478 --> 02:48:18,977
the viewers.

2986
02:48:18,978 --> 02:48:21,377
I hope the viewers will continue...

2987
02:48:21,378 --> 02:48:23,576
to give affection and love...

2988
02:48:23,577 --> 02:48:27,587
to the ten participants no matter where they are.

2989
02:48:29,718 --> 02:48:32,487
Thank you for watching My Sibling's Romance.

2990
02:48:34,628 --> 02:48:35,628
No one else said it.

2991
02:48:35,997 --> 02:48:37,198
Hye Jin, what was that?

2992
02:48:37,558 --> 02:48:39,166
- Were we supposed to say it? - I was waiting.

2993
02:48:39,167 --> 02:48:40,367
- Thank you. - Bye.

2994
02:48:40,368 --> 02:48:42,097
- Bye. - Thank you.

2995
02:48:42,198 --> 02:48:44,736
- My Sibling's Romance. - My Sibling's Romance.

2996
02:48:44,737 --> 02:48:45,937
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2997
02:48:45,938 --> 02:48:47,336
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2998
02:48:47,337 --> 02:48:48,506
Please give them a lot of love.

2999
02:48:48,507 --> 02:48:49,507
Was there something like that?

3000
02:48:49,508 --> 02:48:51,006
- Is it the end? - Was there a slogan?

3001
02:48:51,007 --> 02:48:52,548
I said it for the first and the last time.

3002
02:48:53,378 --> 02:48:56,548
The three weeks felt like a dream from the very beginning.

3003
02:48:57,448 --> 02:48:59,987
Now, it's time to wake up.

3004
02:49:04,757 --> 02:49:07,028
Today as well, Yong Woo became flustered once.

3005
02:49:07,128 --> 02:49:08,358
It's a video.

3006
02:49:09,058 --> 02:49:10,897
Yun Jae was the most unexpected.

3007
02:49:10,997 --> 02:49:12,198
- Seriously. - I know.

3008
02:49:13,267 --> 02:49:14,968
He is a puppy. What is the puppy doing?

3009
02:49:15,067 --> 02:49:16,198
He is next to Jae Hyung.

3010
02:49:19,067 --> 02:49:20,907
I had one sibling.

3011
02:49:21,337 --> 02:49:23,337
It feels like I gained eight more siblings.

3012
02:49:25,507 --> 02:49:28,007
The siblings who came together...

3013
02:49:28,108 --> 02:49:30,647
can become home to each other.

3014
02:49:31,788 --> 02:49:34,017
They are truly precious to me...

3015
02:49:34,888 --> 02:49:36,157
like a family.

3016
02:49:36,587 --> 02:49:39,657
Cheol Hyeon and I spend a lot of time by ourselves,

3017
02:49:39,858 --> 02:49:43,557
so I thought it would be nice to have a crew.

3018
02:49:43,558 --> 02:49:45,896
That was why each member...

3019
02:49:45,897 --> 02:49:47,727
felt precious to me.

3020
02:49:47,728 --> 02:49:49,868
Each member felt like a family.

3021
02:49:50,038 --> 02:49:52,368
It was such a nice and happy time.

3022
02:49:52,538 --> 02:49:55,808
I am very happy that I built precious relationships.

3023
02:49:55,907 --> 02:49:57,577
It was a meaningful time.

3024
02:49:58,708 --> 02:50:01,277
It was a good opportunity..

3025
02:50:01,278 --> 02:50:03,816
That made me become passionate about my life...

3026
02:50:03,817 --> 02:50:05,517
and live my days with seriousness.

3027
02:50:05,817 --> 02:50:08,517
I thought I was the most average person,

3028
02:50:08,757 --> 02:50:09,957
so I was very scared.

3029
02:50:09,958 --> 02:50:12,487
But it was a very nice experience.

3030
02:50:13,058 --> 02:50:16,397
What would I have done without this experience?

3031
02:50:16,757 --> 02:50:18,798
I am so thankful for it.

3032
02:50:20,628 --> 02:50:23,698
It's an experience I won't get to have again.

3033
02:50:23,897 --> 02:50:25,566
That's why it's so precious.

3034
02:50:25,567 --> 02:50:27,608
It was perfect.

3035
02:50:28,237 --> 02:50:31,038
I felt a lot of warmth here.

3036
02:50:31,608 --> 02:50:32,608
It's nice to meet you.

3037
02:50:32,907 --> 02:50:36,048
I was very wary of other people.

3038
02:50:36,247 --> 02:50:39,287
The experience healed me in that regard.

3039
02:50:39,288 --> 02:50:41,486
Run over here.

3040
02:50:41,487 --> 02:50:44,487
(The new friends' existence was healing.)

3041
02:50:45,628 --> 02:50:47,256
- Well done. - Thank you.

3042

(The 1st Duet Contest with Siblings)

3043
02:50:49,858 --> 02:50:50,897
(The entire group reunited.)

3044
02:51:00,608 --> 02:51:05,878
(Each photo contains an unforgettable moment.)

3045
02:51:08,378 --> 02:51:13,948
(Another family album has been added.)

3046
02:51:14,017 --> 02:51:15,858
(An amazing lesson from the talented instructor!)

3047
02:51:15,917 --> 02:51:16,917
(Mom, are you listening?)

3048
02:51:16,918 --> 02:51:18,087
(The Little Mermaid)

3049
02:51:19,157 --> 02:51:22,298
(They met each other.)

3050
02:51:22,798 --> 02:51:25,698
(They got to know each other.)

3051
02:51:26,128 --> 02:51:28,298
(They become each other's family.)

3052
02:51:28,767 --> 02:51:30,867
- Shall we get going now? - Let's go.

3053
02:51:30,868 --> 02:51:33,707
- Hi. - H-I.

3054
02:51:33,708 --> 02:51:34,907
We can say "Bye" too.

3055
02:51:35,108 --> 02:51:36,607
- Bye. - B-Y-E.

3056
02:51:36,608 --> 02:51:37,637
B-Y-E.

3057
02:51:37,638 --> 02:51:38,647
B-Y-E.

3058
02:51:38,907 --> 02:51:40,307
That doesn't sound right.

3059
02:51:40,308 --> 02:51:41,308
Seriously.

3060
02:51:42,017 --> 02:51:43,146
B-Y-E.
