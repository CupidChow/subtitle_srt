1
00:00:00,211 --> 00:00:04,110
(The day the first snow fell)

2
00:00:04,111 --> 00:00:06,951
(Is this a sign that I can meet someone good?)

3
00:00:07,181 --> 00:00:09,451
(I might have wanted a moment like this.)

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,721
(Hurrah.)

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,221
(The first date was perfect.)

6
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,661
(It was a very cruel moment.)

7
00:00:21,701 --> 00:00:23,831
(Yong Woo's feelings...)

8
00:00:26,201 --> 00:00:28,140
(headed to Cho A.)

9
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:32,240
(But I guess I'm not it for him.)

10
00:00:32,241 --> 00:00:34,880
(A letter arrived.)

11
00:00:34,881 --> 00:00:38,451
(We will go on a two-days-one-night trip to Gangwon Province.)

12
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:44,180
(The men chose their date.)

13
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:46,319
"The sibling of the chosen person..."

14
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,061
(The sibling of the woman chose her date.)

15
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:51,760
(And the secret room that was revealed)

16
00:00:51,761 --> 00:00:53,830
(We're going to talk about Cho A.)

17
00:00:53,831 --> 00:00:55,830
(What kind of man does she like?)

18
00:00:55,831 --> 00:00:57,459
(What kind of date does she like?)

19
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,900
(You're asking me questions instead.)

20
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:02,199
(It felt like he wanted to fight for and win my sister...)

21
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,640
(that he would never let her get taken away.)

22
00:01:03,641 --> 00:01:05,440
(I saw those kinds of eyes.)

23
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:08,380
(Cho A's sibling chose you.)

24
00:01:08,381 --> 00:01:10,979
(I didn't get chosen.)

25
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,309
(My sibling is going to choose?)

26
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:15,819
(Jae Hyung got a second chance.)

27
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,950
(I think tonight's going to be rather fun.)

28
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,460
(What kind of personality is that?)

29
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,460
(Gosh, he's new.)

30
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:30,260
(Who is Ji Won's sibling that's talking with Jae Hyung?)

31
00:01:47,051 --> 00:01:48,381
(Ji Won's sibling, Yun Jae)

32
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:49,819
(Jonathan)

33
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,179
- They look alike. - They look so alike.

34
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,251
- Yun Jae. - They look alike.

35
00:01:52,421 --> 00:01:54,119
- Their noses look similar. - Their noses really look similar.

36
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,159
He has a completely different kind of vibe.

37
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,821
- There's nobody like him here. - Yes.

38
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:04,201
(Ji Won's sibling, Yun Jae)

39
00:02:04,301 --> 00:02:08,271
The participants shared their jobs with each other.

40
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,571
So you can't ask them about their jobs.

41
00:02:10,641 --> 00:02:13,040
- There's a piano underground. - Yes.

42
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:15,580
You know the piano underground?

43
00:02:15,581 --> 00:02:17,939
Ji Won's quite good at piano.

44
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,551
It will be obvious if I make her play,

45
00:02:20,451 --> 00:02:21,921
so try and get her to play it.

46
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,249
I got it. Which genre does she play?

47
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,290
I think she plays classical songs more.

48
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:29,391
Really?

49
00:02:30,821 --> 00:02:33,830
Did she play the piano since she was young?

50
00:02:33,831 --> 00:02:36,230
Yes, she was very good at playing piano since she was young.

51
00:02:36,231 --> 00:02:37,361
Really?

52
00:02:38,601 --> 00:02:41,201
Okay, I'll ask her about it.

53
00:02:41,801 --> 00:02:43,970
- She's a good singer too. Yes. - Really?

54
00:02:46,671 --> 00:02:48,840
Do you have anything you want to know about Ji Won?

55
00:02:49,011 --> 00:02:51,950
Is Ji Won kind of shy around strangers?

56
00:02:51,951 --> 00:02:53,880
Yes, she is a bit.

57
00:02:54,481 --> 00:02:57,119
I'm not sure whether she doesn't talk much...

58
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,291
because she's shy...

59
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,559
or because she has yet to fit in,

60
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,089
that was why I asked.

61
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:08,230
From what I see, I think she talks less...

62
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:09,630
because she has yet to fit in.

63
00:03:10,831 --> 00:03:12,331
Have you lived overseas?

64
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:15,370
Yes, I went to Germany as an exchange student.

65
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,241
About eight months?

66
00:03:17,641 --> 00:03:19,671
Ji Won studied in Canada too.

67
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:21,410
Did she study abroad?

68
00:03:21,611 --> 00:03:22,680
Yes.

69
00:03:23,081 --> 00:03:24,240
What did she study?

70
00:03:24,241 --> 00:03:26,679
She studied business administration.

71
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,910
Really?

72
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,521
Did she go to Canada when she was a university student?

73
00:03:32,821 --> 00:03:35,891
Or was she living there and naturally continued to study there?

74
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,730
She studied abroad since she was young...

75
00:03:38,731 --> 00:03:40,160
and stayed there until university.

76
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,760
She must be good at English.

77
00:03:41,761 --> 00:03:43,201
Yes, she's good at English.

78
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,600
I haven't talked with Ji Won that much,

79
00:03:48,601 --> 00:03:50,969
so I heard about that for the first time.

80
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:52,740
Those aspects were very new...

81
00:03:52,741 --> 00:03:54,641
and most memorable.

82
00:03:54,981 --> 00:03:56,279
Shall we call it a day today?

83
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,511
Okay, I understand.

84
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,379
- See you later. - Okay, thank you.

85
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,481
Okay.

86
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,750
(Jae Hyung's interview ends.)

87
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:09,819
I thought that he was close to Ji Won's ideal type.

88
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,430
Yes, he's the type that my sister would like.

89
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:16,200
(Jae Hyung's interview ends.)

90
00:04:16,861 --> 00:04:19,971
I thought that he was close to Ji Won's ideal type.

91
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:22,901
Yes, he's the type that my sister would like.

92
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,369
(Were the guys your sister dated similar to Jae Hyung?)

93
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,770
Yes, most of them were handsome,

94
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,541
so I think they were similar to Jae Hyung.

95
00:04:28,841 --> 00:04:30,879
Pretty boys and idol-looking boys.

96
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,380
I think she liked these types of guys.

97
00:04:35,051 --> 00:04:37,449
I have a good feeling about this.

98
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:40,220
What if Jae Hyung and Ji Won get together like this?

99
00:04:40,221 --> 00:04:41,860
There's a slight chance.

100
00:04:41,861 --> 00:04:44,421
- He said he was similar to her ex. - That's right.

101
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,560
I'll get going.

102
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:51,460
Again?

103
00:04:51,461 --> 00:04:53,971
- What is this? - I really have no idea.

104
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,601
He'll get going? Where is he going again?

105
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:07,651
(The second applicant Cheol Hyeon enters.)

106
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,519
I went to the place...

107
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,889
where Ji Won's sibling tested me.

108
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:17,290
I decided to attend it honestly.

109
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:20,290
I decided not to lie to get chosen...

110
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:21,531
by Ji Won's sibling.

111
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,869
But somewhat,

112
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:28,870
due to his striped top...

113
00:05:29,301 --> 00:05:31,341
- Does he look like a criminal? - It looks like he's in prison.

114
00:05:32,171 --> 00:05:33,241
Hello, Cheol Hyeon.

115
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:35,139
Hello.

116
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,611
Why did you choose Ji Won?

117
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,050
Ji Won seemed to have a very calm personality.

118
00:05:41,051 --> 00:05:44,249
"What kind of thoughts does she have?"

119
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,950
I was very curious about that.

120
00:05:46,091 --> 00:05:47,620
Is there anything you would like to know?

121
00:05:48,051 --> 00:05:51,290
What kind of person is Ji Won?

122
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:55,231
I think she tries to think rationally all the time.

123
00:05:57,801 --> 00:06:01,270
Have you seen her emotional side?

124
00:06:02,901 --> 00:06:06,640
Her emotional side is very hard to see.

125
00:06:07,111 --> 00:06:08,780
She doesn't show her emotions much.

126
00:06:08,781 --> 00:06:11,680
But occasionally, she can be frustrating because she's rational.

127
00:06:12,851 --> 00:06:13,950
I see.

128
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,080
But what I felt from seeing Ji Won for a short while...

129
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,221
was that she looked like she had a strong sense of responsibility.

130
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:22,420
Was what I felt correct?

131
00:06:22,421 --> 00:06:23,861
Yes, that's exactly right.

132
00:06:25,531 --> 00:06:28,390
Is she very independent by any chance?

133
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,700
Yes, very.

134
00:06:30,301 --> 00:06:32,731
I was quite surprised about Cheol Hyeon.

135
00:06:32,971 --> 00:06:36,700
He got a grasp of Ji Won within that short amount of time.

136
00:06:36,801 --> 00:06:40,309
I don't think you can tell one's independence...

137
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:42,640
and personal autonomy in two days.

138
00:06:42,741 --> 00:06:44,810
But he caught on to those very well.

139
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,250
- He's very proactive. - He is.

140
00:06:47,481 --> 00:06:49,150
It must be hard to choose.

141
00:06:49,151 --> 00:06:52,050
Yes. Both of them are proactive.

142
00:06:52,051 --> 00:06:53,091
That's right.

143
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:57,390
And I think my explanation for choosing Ji Won...

144
00:06:57,591 --> 00:06:59,429
was quite short just now.

145
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:03,300
I had a feeling that Ji Won's and my interests...

146
00:07:03,301 --> 00:07:05,129
would be similar.

147
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:07,971
What kind of person are you when you date?

148
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,900
I think I'm very affectionate.

149
00:07:09,901 --> 00:07:12,309
When I think I'm close with someone...

150
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:14,540
and I need to take care of them,

151
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:17,610
I open up a lot only to them.

152
00:07:17,611 --> 00:07:18,611
But I'm also...

153
00:07:18,851 --> 00:07:21,480
very independent and responsible.

154
00:07:21,481 --> 00:07:23,519
But sometimes, those become too much...

155
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,949
and I end up tormenting myself.

156
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:27,651
So I wondered what kind of person Ji Won was.

157
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:31,390
That side of her is ever so consistent.

158
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,690
That makes me more curious.

159
00:07:35,801 --> 00:07:37,301
That makes me more curious.

160
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,769
I think Ji Won is very pretty.

161
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:42,639
She has the face that everyone likes.

162
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,069
She looks hip.

163
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,370
She has a very pretty nose.

164
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:46,911
Her nose?

165
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:50,711
She has a very pretty nose. So, yes.

166
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:54,281
I think saying she's pretty once is enough.

167
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:59,850
Did the type of sibling that we wanted finally arrive?

168
00:07:59,851 --> 00:08:01,651
He is her sibling. I'm sure of it.

169
00:08:03,591 --> 00:08:05,120
Once is enough?

170
00:08:07,591 --> 00:08:09,230
Yes. I don't really want to know.

171
00:08:09,231 --> 00:08:10,560
I get it.

172
00:08:13,531 --> 00:08:16,241
By any chance, can you cut your hair?

173
00:08:17,171 --> 00:08:18,241
What?

174
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:20,140
(That's exactly what I think.)

175
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:23,241
By any chance, can you cut your hair?

176
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,310
What?

177
00:08:25,311 --> 00:08:27,181
(That's exactly what I think.)

178
00:08:27,311 --> 00:08:29,250
By any chance, can you cut your hair?

179
00:08:29,481 --> 00:08:31,920
Yes, I wanted to cut it right away.

180
00:08:32,191 --> 00:08:35,420
Is my current hair that strange?

181
00:08:35,691 --> 00:08:38,320
Is my hair messy?

182
00:08:38,321 --> 00:08:41,061
No, I'm actually very handsome.

183
00:08:42,961 --> 00:08:46,869
Did he say that because I didn't look good?

184
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:49,040
Do I look a bit shallow?

185
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:51,539
If your hair is neat,

186
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,269
it's easier to get someone's trust.

187
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,971
I was a bit worried.

188
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:58,310
I thought I should cut my hair and show them my neat side.

189
00:08:58,311 --> 00:09:00,550
Ji Won doesn't like long hair.

190
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,879
There's no exception.

191
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,980
Cheol Hyeon immediately and willingly said...

192
00:09:02,981 --> 00:09:04,280
that he would cut his hair.

193
00:09:04,481 --> 00:09:07,019
That made me score him higher in terms of charms.

194
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,821
He's someone who can go that far...

195
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:11,220
to earn Ji Won's favour.

196
00:09:11,221 --> 00:09:14,389
What is Ji Won's ideal type?

197
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:16,659
The person shouldn't be frustrating.

198
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:19,070
- Also, he has to be good-natured. - Good-natured.

199
00:09:19,071 --> 00:09:21,530
Nowadays, she talks more about the person being good-natured.

200
00:09:23,471 --> 00:09:25,100
Shall we call it a day today?

201
00:09:25,101 --> 00:09:27,669
Thank you for choosing Ji Won. I'll think hard about it.

202
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,840
Okay. Thank you.

203
00:09:28,841 --> 00:09:30,941
I want to see you soon.

204
00:09:32,851 --> 00:09:33,910
See you later.

205
00:09:34,181 --> 00:09:36,221
- Okay, see you later. - Okay.

206
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:42,420
(The 2nd round of the Secret Room interview ends.)

207
00:09:44,091 --> 00:09:46,091
Does it make your lips red?

208
00:09:47,491 --> 00:09:49,061
It does give you a bit of colour.

209
00:09:50,561 --> 00:09:52,100
(The 2nd round of the Secret Room interview has ended.)

210
00:09:52,101 --> 00:09:53,669
(You can check the results of the date interviews by calling.)

211
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,740
(To prevent any guesses, everyone must call the number.)

212
00:09:55,741 --> 00:09:58,000
What is this?

213
00:10:01,841 --> 00:10:03,241
I'll go first.

214
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:13,591
(He calls for the second time.)

215
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:19,231
(Did Yun Jae, Ji Won's sibling, choose Jae Hyung?)

216
00:10:20,961 --> 00:10:22,061
Who will get chosen?

217
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,630
What if Jae Hyung doesn't get chosen again?

218
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,770
Ji Won's sibling did not choose you.

219
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:37,481
Really?

220
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,549
- That was really good though. - Oh, dear.

221
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,250
I thought he did well this time too.

222
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,350
- It's a pity. - Poor him.

223
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,090
It would feel like he didn't pass the interview...

224
00:10:46,091 --> 00:10:47,619
that was conducted by a fellow man.

225
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,759
- That's right. - Yes.

226
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,619
There's a want to be a good person in the eyes of men.

227
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,660
There is.

228
00:10:53,191 --> 00:10:56,861
(Ji Won's sibling did not choose you.)

229
00:11:00,971 --> 00:11:03,299
You will go on the trip with those...

230
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,540
that were not chosen.

231
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:07,741
Please hang up and wait at the table.

232
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,591
- Are you supposed to call? - Yes, you're supposed to call.

233
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:23,390
Should we go in according to this order?

234
00:11:25,221 --> 00:11:26,491
This shouldn't matter, right?

235
00:11:27,731 --> 00:11:29,460
It seems like we each need to decide the order too.

236
00:11:29,461 --> 00:11:30,931
I wasn't chosen.

237
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:35,169
(Yun Jae chose Cheol Hyeon as Ji Won's date.)

238
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:36,370
Cheol Hyeon.

239
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:40,370
He showed a lot of interest in Ji Won in a short time.

240
00:11:40,471 --> 00:11:42,510
And I thought that he observed well.

241
00:11:42,841 --> 00:11:44,111
But Jae Hyung wasn't like that.

242
00:11:44,211 --> 00:11:47,149
I don't think he knew well about Ji Won.

243
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:50,649
Anyway, they will be going on a date,

244
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:53,220
so Cheol Hyeon looked like a better person...

245
00:11:53,221 --> 00:11:55,790
to make a comfortable situation.

246
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,020
That's right, I'm the only one that wasn't chosen.

247
00:11:59,231 --> 00:12:01,991
This is rare.

248
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:11,441
(Cheol Hyeon enters.)

249
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:24,549
Ji Won's sibling chose you.

250
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,991
You will have a date with Ji Won.

251
00:12:27,451 --> 00:12:30,019
Please hang up and go back to your seat.

252
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,890
(Ji Won and Cheol Hyeon will have a 2 days 1 night Gangwon date.)

253
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,560
Then he can hang up and go straight to a barber shop.

254
00:12:35,561 --> 00:12:37,601
No, he should take scissors and head to the bathroom.

255
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:39,471
No.

256
00:12:40,071 --> 00:12:42,029
- He should shave his hair. - Yes.

257
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,971
It would be cool if he really cut his hair.

258
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,840
When I got the call saying I was chosen,

259
00:12:48,841 --> 00:12:51,380
I was very happy.

260
00:12:51,841 --> 00:12:54,649
Did I appeal well?

261
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:55,821
I was happy.

262
00:12:58,951 --> 00:13:00,050
(Glancing)

263
00:13:11,831 --> 00:13:13,701
(Yong Woo enters.)

264
00:13:14,601 --> 00:13:18,399
(He's calling for the second time without any clue.)

265
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,570
Why does Yong Woo always become...

266
00:13:19,571 --> 00:13:20,711
- a scapegoat? - For the whole day...

267
00:13:21,241 --> 00:13:23,081
For the whole day, he doesn't know anything.

268
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,910
- Seriously. - Yes.

269
00:13:26,451 --> 00:13:28,920
You look really cool today.

270
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,321
All the best.

271
00:13:30,951 --> 00:13:33,091
(He was complimented again.)

272
00:13:34,221 --> 00:13:35,290
I mean...

273
00:13:36,061 --> 00:13:37,159
- Yong Woo. - He...

274
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,961
He really wouldn't know what it's about.

275
00:13:39,061 --> 00:13:41,160
- At this point... - He must be so frustrated.

276
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,259
"What am I doing?" He'll feel like this.

277
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,259
Yong Woo's the only one...

278
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,270
- who has no clue. - It's too...

279
00:13:53,971 --> 00:13:55,270
- He came out. - Yes.

280
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:09,061
Honestly, I still don't understand even now.

281
00:14:09,321 --> 00:14:11,520
Secret Room... Isn't that like a hideout?

282
00:14:11,961 --> 00:14:14,491
(Jung Sub whose date with Cho A is already confirmed)

283
00:14:14,961 --> 00:14:17,331
You look really cool today.

284
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:18,760
All the best.

285
00:14:21,831 --> 00:14:24,170
(All the dates have been decided.)

286
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,741
- Did everyone go in? - Yes.

287
00:14:27,711 --> 00:14:29,941
Do you think there should be one more person?

288
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,241
I don't know.

289
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,350
- See you. - Okay.

290
00:14:37,351 --> 00:14:38,480
Yong Woo, where are you going?

291
00:14:38,481 --> 00:14:41,749
(Yong Woo has a date tonight.)

292
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,390
It's the date, finally.

293
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,419
- With Cho A. - Today, that's right.

294
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,730
- Finally. - Finally.

295
00:14:46,731 --> 00:14:48,231
Ring-ring Random Date.

296
00:14:48,331 --> 00:14:51,500
(Cho A and Yong Woo, Ring-ring Random Date)

297
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:02,880
(A cart bar in Namyeong-dong)

298
00:15:39,681 --> 00:15:41,009
Hello.

299
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:42,280
Hello. Gosh.

300
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,720
I didn't see you around the whole day.

301
00:15:44,721 --> 00:15:46,591
- I said that I had a date. - Yes.

302
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,690
- That... - Yes.

303
00:15:48,691 --> 00:15:51,389
I was waiting, and Cho A walked in.

304
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,591
I was surprised and amazed.

305
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,260
I thought it would be Yun Ha,

306
00:15:55,701 --> 00:15:56,900
but Cho A came.

307
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,269
Yes, he wasn't expecting her.

308
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,369
He must've been in the dark until the end.

309
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:01,470
Imagine how happy he must be.

310
00:16:01,471 --> 00:16:03,540
Exactly. Something in him broke.

311
00:16:03,971 --> 00:16:05,170
- How was the day? - When did you arrive?

312
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,870
About ten minutes ago?

313
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:08,769
Let's eat something delicious.

314
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,039
What shall we eat?

315
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,741
I want to eat something warm.

316
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,080
- Something warm? - Yes.

317
00:16:13,081 --> 00:16:14,749
There was a dish with an interesting name.

318
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,049
Seafood cream pasta soup.

319
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:17,119
You're right.

320
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,090
This looks like a warm dish, right?

321
00:16:19,091 --> 00:16:20,119
- Good. - Are you okay with it?

322
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,419
- Yes. - Okay.

323
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,890
Did you know I was coming?

324
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,821
- I didn't. Yes. - Really?

325
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,129
Could you not figure it out from the call?

326
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:28,930
Did you know it was me right away?

327
00:16:28,931 --> 00:16:30,461
I didn't at first.

328
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:32,530
- When did you find out? - Halfway.

329
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,369
I could feel it from the way you spoke.

330
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,240
- How do I speak? - There's a way.

331
00:16:38,241 --> 00:16:41,210
The way of speech that only you use.

332
00:16:41,211 --> 00:16:44,340
Really? There's a way of speech that only I use? I'm curious.

333
00:16:44,341 --> 00:16:47,050
- Gosh, the vibe is so different. - It's different.

334
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,980
- What's with this guy? - It's very different.

335
00:16:48,981 --> 00:16:50,350
This is fascinating.

336
00:16:50,351 --> 00:16:52,180
- What's this? - It's so different.

337
00:16:52,181 --> 00:16:53,650
It feels heavier.

338
00:16:53,651 --> 00:16:54,950
That's right,

339
00:16:54,951 --> 00:16:56,819
- It's serious. - it's calmer.

340
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,259
Normally,

341
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,859
he would've made a joke about the pasta soup.

342
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,059
- That's right. - Yes.

343
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,529
- He... Yes. - He would've gone from soup...

344
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:03,960
to shoot or something.

345
00:17:03,961 --> 00:17:05,999
"Pasta shoot." I think he would've done that,

346
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,401
but he didn't do that.

347
00:17:07,971 --> 00:17:09,769
But I'm a bit disappointed at him not making a joke...

348
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:10,800
when he always did.

349
00:17:11,641 --> 00:17:13,410
Now that it's gone when it was there, right?

350
00:17:13,411 --> 00:17:15,640
- Let's see if he makes dad jokes. - It feels empty.

351
00:17:15,641 --> 00:17:17,580
- He should do it at least once. - He should do it once right?

352
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:19,779
- Exactly. Gosh. - Okay, thank you.

353
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:20,849
After you're finished,

354
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:22,650
you can order risotto, so let me know.

355
00:17:22,651 --> 00:17:23,951
- Okay. - Thank you.

356
00:17:24,951 --> 00:17:26,151
Be careful.

357
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:29,461
- It looks delicious. - Exactly.

358
00:17:30,161 --> 00:17:31,391
Are you going to remove all the shells for me?

359
00:17:31,491 --> 00:17:32,931
- It's okay. - This?

360
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,691
Just enough for you to eat first.

361
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,030
It has a lot of seafood.

362
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,410
I noticed it since just now,

363
00:17:47,411 --> 00:17:48,641
but you let it down completely.

364
00:17:48,741 --> 00:17:49,880
- Let what down? - Your hair.

365
00:17:49,881 --> 00:17:50,940
My hair? Yes.

366
00:17:50,941 --> 00:17:52,950
It was always like this.

367
00:17:52,951 --> 00:17:54,180
That's right, because of work.

368
00:17:54,181 --> 00:17:56,181
- That's right. I see. - When I work,

369
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,749
- You're right. - I can't focus...

370
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,250
if my hair touches me, so I tie it up.

371
00:18:02,121 --> 00:18:03,661
I dolled up prettily to come here.

372
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:05,090
That's right.

373
00:18:05,421 --> 00:18:06,631
That's the answer.

374
00:18:06,931 --> 00:18:10,160
But I'm not saying you don't look pretty...

375
00:18:10,161 --> 00:18:11,860
- when you tie your hair. - Really?

376
00:18:12,161 --> 00:18:13,371
But this is my first time seeing you let your hair down.

377
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,971
Is this the first time?

378
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,540
You mean today? You're right.

379
00:18:18,701 --> 00:18:20,270
Because you've been working continuously.

380
00:18:21,371 --> 00:18:22,580
How do I look with my hair down?

381
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,610
You give off a very different vibe.

382
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,220
I'll tell you what kind of vibe.

383
00:18:29,221 --> 00:18:32,220
It changed from a very straight and upright vibe...

384
00:18:32,221 --> 00:18:34,049
to a bit relaxed vibe.

385
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:35,621
- Really? - Yes.

386
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:38,560
It feels like the flavour, some pepper was added.

387
00:18:40,391 --> 00:18:41,860
You're bringing up pepper here?

388
00:18:44,731 --> 00:18:47,171
- Pepper means a good thing today. - That's right.

389
00:18:48,131 --> 00:18:50,770
- It's good then. - Of course.

390
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,970
Your hair is longer than I thought.

391
00:18:52,971 --> 00:18:54,370
You didn't know when I had it tied, did you?

392
00:18:54,371 --> 00:18:55,371
Exactly, I had no idea.

393
00:18:55,372 --> 00:18:57,140
- Thi-wa for thick wave? - Thi-wa?

394
00:18:57,141 --> 00:18:58,181
Thi-wa.

395
00:18:58,441 --> 00:18:59,749
It's hard to pronounce.

396
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:00,779
Thi-wa.

397
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,480
You're the first person to say it that way.

398
00:19:02,481 --> 00:19:03,951
- Thi-wa? - Thi-wa.

399
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:07,319
His jokes don't differentiate the occasions.

400
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,590
This will be the first and the last one.

401
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:10,559
It's hard to pronounce too. Thi-wa.

402
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,290
I've never heard of thi-wa before.

403
00:19:12,731 --> 00:19:14,059
- Thi-wa. - Thi-wa.

404
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,191
Thi-wa.

405
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,231
I have a question.

406
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:20,730
When we talked about our jobs,

407
00:19:20,731 --> 00:19:23,839
you said that you came to a consensus...

408
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,839
after thinking hard about it.

409
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,770
Did you think hard about your career?

410
00:19:28,171 --> 00:19:30,509
Realistically, this was what I did,

411
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:33,180
but in the naive thought, this looked so cool.

412
00:19:33,181 --> 00:19:34,411
I just wanted to do it.

413
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:37,579
So I didn't think much about it, actually.

414
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,950
The thing I was concerned about was,

415
00:19:39,951 --> 00:19:42,421
"Is it okay to do this?" I thought hard about that,

416
00:19:42,451 --> 00:19:43,590
but it lasted for a short while.

417
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:46,231
I did say it, but I just went for it.

418
00:19:46,391 --> 00:19:49,230
- Really? - I just followed...

419
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:50,259
what I wanted to do.

420
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,999
Did you follow your heart then?

421
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,270
Yes, that was what I did.

422
00:19:53,731 --> 00:19:55,600
- You're cool. - I'm not.

423
00:19:56,441 --> 00:20:00,569
Then do you tend to make all choices that way?

424
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:03,039
For other things, I have an algorithm...

425
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:06,951
that analyses something a lot to come up with the best results.

426
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:10,080
But strangely, when it comes to making big decisions like that...

427
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:14,050
or for really important moments,

428
00:20:14,651 --> 00:20:17,621
I just do what feels right.

429
00:20:18,661 --> 00:20:21,260
- I think that's how I am. - In big decisions,

430
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,731
is dating included?

431
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,600
Dating is included.

432
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:27,870
I didn't decide on certain requirements...

433
00:20:27,871 --> 00:20:30,040
and meet only those that fit the requirements...

434
00:20:30,941 --> 00:20:32,099
when I think back to it now.

435
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,839
Did you just follow your heart then?

436
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,871
I think so.

437
00:20:36,981 --> 00:20:38,741
I didn't analyse a lot when it came to dating.

438
00:20:41,181 --> 00:20:43,050
Actually, this is almost my first time talking about this.

439
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,681
Because nobody asked.

440
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:47,790
I don't think there was a time for me to say it first either.

441
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:49,790
I'll ask you a lot.

442
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,961
A wish that's not so much of a wish is,

443
00:20:53,131 --> 00:20:56,631
you also have the side of you that I'm seeing now.

444
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,900
If you let loose just a tiny bit of this side of you...

445
00:20:58,901 --> 00:21:01,170
when you're with everyone else,

446
00:21:01,171 --> 00:21:03,740
I think everyone will have a lot more fun.

447
00:21:03,741 --> 00:21:05,070
Really?

448
00:21:05,201 --> 00:21:07,240
Your skirt today looks very unique too.

449
00:21:07,241 --> 00:21:08,509
- My skirt? - It's like...

450
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:10,339
- Do you know what I thought? - What did you think?

451
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:12,510
- It looked like a Christmas tree. - Really?

452
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:16,549
I think you're very imaginative. You're creative too.

453
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:19,890
- "Should I wrap it with strings?" - Do you mean light bulbs?

454
00:21:19,891 --> 00:21:20,990
- Something like these. - Are you going to...

455
00:21:20,991 --> 00:21:22,089
wrap light bulbs around me?

456
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:23,359
Does that make me a human tree?

457
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,260
If a tree doesn't arrive, please do us a favour.

458
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:29,231
When I see you talk,

459
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:31,100
I cannot guess where the conversation will go next.

460
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:35,171
- Suddenly a tree? - Yes, a tree.

461
00:21:35,931 --> 00:21:38,440
Do you like change...

462
00:21:38,441 --> 00:21:39,940
or do you like stability?

463
00:21:39,941 --> 00:21:41,770
I like stability.

464
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:44,579
You like stability,

465
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:47,950
but you don't like it if it's boring and old-fashioned.

466
00:21:47,951 --> 00:21:49,420
I used to think that,

467
00:21:49,421 --> 00:21:53,019
but now, I prefer to have the stability as the base...

468
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,750
- That's right. - and get to know deeper from there.

469
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:59,059
Before, I used to want...

470
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,130
to know about this and that,

471
00:22:01,131 --> 00:22:04,230
but now, from that stable state,

472
00:22:04,231 --> 00:22:07,471
I prefer to get to know someone more deeply gradually.

473
00:22:07,901 --> 00:22:09,171
- You're right. - Yes.

474
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,499
- When it comes to relationships, - Yes.

475
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,540
If your significant others keep changing,

476
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,870
- it will be more exhausting. - I see.

477
00:22:15,871 --> 00:22:17,941
It's more exhausting than boring. People might get sick of that.

478
00:22:18,381 --> 00:22:19,411
- I see. - Seeing that kind of behaviour.

479
00:22:19,681 --> 00:22:22,050
So I totally agree with what you just said.

480
00:22:23,621 --> 00:22:25,319
I get the feeling that...

481
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,020
you're good at adjusting to this kind of atmosphere.

482
00:22:27,191 --> 00:22:28,950
Is it because you were often the class president...

483
00:22:28,951 --> 00:22:30,660
and school president when you were young?

484
00:22:30,661 --> 00:22:32,161
When I think about the letter, I still...

485
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,559
The letter described you as an attractive guy.

486
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,560
- Is that so? - Yes.

487
00:22:35,461 --> 00:22:37,800
This is just my personal opinion.

488
00:22:37,961 --> 00:22:41,329
To me, men who can cry are truly cool.

489
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:42,330
Is that so?

490
00:22:42,331 --> 00:22:45,400
Some people say that men aren't supposed to cry and all.

491
00:22:45,401 --> 00:22:49,269
But I don't like that kind of way of thinking.

492
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,340
- Really? - Yes.

493
00:22:50,741 --> 00:22:51,980
Then I made the right call to cry.

494
00:22:51,981 --> 00:22:53,079
Yes.

495
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,151
Do we have some tissue here?

496
00:22:56,621 --> 00:22:57,921
I suddenly feel something in my eyes.

497
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,860
You looked so perfect before reading that letter.

498
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,789
- I saw you were just like us... - Really?

499
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:06,731
- when you read it. - I'm not perfect.

500
00:23:06,891 --> 00:23:08,931
- No? - I'm not perfect at all.

501
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:11,700
By the way, you're very different from your first impression.

502
00:23:11,701 --> 00:23:12,731
How am I in your eyes?

503
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:14,529
After talking to you that night,

504
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:17,170
you seemed like a different person.

505
00:23:17,171 --> 00:23:18,340
- After our date that night? - Yes.

506
00:23:18,971 --> 00:23:21,539
I thought the same thing about you.

507
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,981
- To use temperature as an example, - Yes.

508
00:23:23,381 --> 00:23:25,640
You're on the warmer side of the temperature.

509
00:23:25,641 --> 00:23:26,681
I see.

510
00:23:26,981 --> 00:23:29,350
That's such a sweet thing to say. "On the warmer side."

511
00:23:29,651 --> 00:23:31,820
It was more comfortable this time.

512
00:23:32,121 --> 00:23:34,151
There's a vibe only Cho A has.

513
00:23:34,651 --> 00:23:37,661
Talking to Cho A is quite therapeutic even for me.

514
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,860
She's a warmhearted person too.

515
00:23:40,191 --> 00:23:41,391
She suits winter well.

516
00:23:41,991 --> 00:23:43,431
Being with her in winter will be great.

517
00:23:44,731 --> 00:23:45,961
After today's date,

518
00:23:46,431 --> 00:23:50,340
my feelings for Yong Woo have gotten bigger.

519
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,911
I discovered more thoughtful sides of him.

520
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:56,810
The choice of his words and so on...

521
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:01,050
made me realize that he could be sweet.

522
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:07,891
Hello.

523
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:09,860
Hey, hello.

524
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:11,921
Why were you so busy today?

525
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,790
It's supposed to be top secret.

526
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,161
It's nothing special.

527
00:24:18,731 --> 00:24:20,030
- Nothing special? - Yes.

528
00:24:26,411 --> 00:24:27,540
It's that again.

529
00:24:27,871 --> 00:24:30,040
Her skill of staring into my eyes.

530
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,110
(Ta-Da)

531
00:24:32,951 --> 00:24:34,050
(Ta-Da)

532
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:35,510
(Ta-Da)

533
00:24:36,151 --> 00:24:38,381
I can't look into people's eyes that boldly like you.

534
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:43,190
I felt her gaze, so I looked up.

535
00:24:43,191 --> 00:24:45,391
She was looking at me like this.

536
00:24:45,961 --> 00:24:48,830
There were moments Se Seung stared at me like that.

537
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,130
I don't know how to react when she does that.

538
00:24:51,131 --> 00:24:52,830
I really don't know.

539
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:54,631
So I looked at her once.

540
00:24:55,671 --> 00:24:56,741
Then I couldn't meet her eyes.

541
00:24:57,401 --> 00:24:59,240
I'm good at establishing eye contact.

542
00:24:59,241 --> 00:25:02,110
But meeting Se Seung's eyes feels like...

543
00:25:02,371 --> 00:25:03,981
going into a black hole.

544
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:13,590
What?

545
00:25:20,631 --> 00:25:22,391
Do you fall in love quickly?

546
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,830
- Is that a question? - Yes.

547
00:25:28,131 --> 00:25:29,131
Yes.

548
00:25:29,431 --> 00:25:30,500
Really?

549
00:25:35,371 --> 00:25:37,240
Shall we go back in? This way.

550
00:25:37,241 --> 00:25:40,580
(Cho A and Yong Woo return home.)

551
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:42,411
Grab my hand.

552
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:48,121
(That night, )

553
00:25:50,161 --> 00:25:52,290
(a letter arrived.)

554
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:58,901
To the table.

555
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,569
- Should we open it? - Yes.

556
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:02,600
- Should we open it? - Yes.

557
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:07,339
"In the Secret Room,"

558
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:09,710
"the siblings of the female participants..."

559
00:26:09,711 --> 00:26:12,711
"picked the men for their dates."

560
00:26:13,451 --> 00:26:17,181
"Only the male participants received the information..."

561
00:26:17,421 --> 00:26:19,850
"about their date in a text message."

562
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:21,621
I see.

563
00:26:21,951 --> 00:26:23,921
"Enter the Siblings' Room..."

564
00:26:24,161 --> 00:26:27,391
"and inform your sibling about the date."

565
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:30,131
I see. Their siblings will inform them.

566
00:26:31,231 --> 00:26:34,600
"When you talk to each other, you can't reveal the information..."

567
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:37,300
- "About your date." - "about your date."

568
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:39,540
That's a bit frustrating.

569
00:26:41,241 --> 00:26:42,539
(Your sibling wasn't chosen, so she wasn't matched for a date.)

570
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:43,880
(Your sibling will travel with Jae Hyung and Ju Yeon.)

571
00:26:43,881 --> 00:26:45,211
(Inform the result to your sibling in the Siblings' Room.)

572
00:26:47,211 --> 00:26:48,509
I thought about...

573
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:51,121
how I was going to inform her about the result.

574
00:26:54,191 --> 00:26:56,490
(Your sibling wasn't chosen, so she wasn't matched for a date.)

575
00:26:56,491 --> 00:26:59,259
(Your sibling will travel with Jae Hyung and Yun Ha.)

576
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:01,260
(Inform the result to your sibling in the Siblings' Room.)

577
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,961
I thought about how I could explain...

578
00:27:04,401 --> 00:27:08,671
the result to Ju Yeon without hurting her feelings.

579
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,470
I could tell her the result casually,

580
00:27:10,471 --> 00:27:11,901
but she might be serious about this.

581
00:27:12,441 --> 00:27:14,270
So it might hurt her feelings.

582
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,881
I thought briefly how I could tell her about this...

583
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:18,881
in a playful manner.

584
00:27:19,411 --> 00:27:21,881
Gosh, telling them the result...

585
00:27:22,211 --> 00:27:23,881
- That won't be easy. - Right.

586
00:27:24,181 --> 00:27:25,750
You're right.

587
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:32,690
(Your sibling will travel with Yong Woo.)

588
00:27:32,691 --> 00:27:34,390
(Inform the result to your sibling in the Siblings' Room.)

589
00:27:34,391 --> 00:27:36,089
(You failed to be matched for a date, )

590
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:37,731
(so you'll travel with Ju Yeon and Yun Ha.)

591
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:41,201
I actually liked it.

592
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:43,140
I liked that I could travel...

593
00:27:43,141 --> 00:27:44,401
with the people I already went on a date with.

594
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:48,510
To be honest, I liked that the three of us got to travel together.

595
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:50,410
In a way, it gave me...

596
00:27:50,411 --> 00:27:52,810
a chance to defer my decision.

597
00:27:53,451 --> 00:27:55,710
- Hold on. It said we had to go... - Yes.

598
00:27:55,711 --> 00:27:57,320
To the Siblings' Room.

599
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,550
Then it means Ji Won's sibling...

600
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,650
might be here too.

601
00:28:02,651 --> 00:28:03,721
Right.

602
00:28:04,121 --> 00:28:05,961
Anyway, the numbers don't match.

603
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:14,371
(Siblings' Room)

604
00:28:18,141 --> 00:28:21,171
(Yong Woo enters.)

605
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:34,890
Gosh.

606
00:28:34,891 --> 00:28:39,161
- How long has it been? - How long has it been?

607
00:28:39,661 --> 00:28:42,090
Gosh. It's nice to see you.

608
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:45,131
You're so busy going on dates.

609
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,770
You went on a date with Ji Won too.

610
00:28:46,971 --> 00:28:48,971
How busy you are in Yong Woo Land.

611
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:50,500
Well, it sort of happened...

612
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:52,840
- that way. - You were chosen.

613
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:55,741
It was fun. Ji Won was a charming lady.

614
00:28:56,211 --> 00:28:59,981
Actually, I experienced a lot of changes with my feelings.

615
00:29:00,381 --> 00:29:02,950
I came back to the house after work.

616
00:29:02,951 --> 00:29:04,680
Jae Hyung said he was going to grill pork belly.

617
00:29:04,681 --> 00:29:06,221
- He asked me to join him. - Okay.

618
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,691
That's when I started to notice Jae Hyung...

619
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:12,059
- all of a sudden. - All of a sudden?

620
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,491
- You suddenly noticed him? - Yes.

621
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:17,631
I'm starting to get interested in him romantically more and more.

622
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:19,030
- That's nice. - Yes.

623
00:29:19,031 --> 00:29:21,401
Is that why you guys went on a date?

624
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:22,930
You went to karaoke.

625
00:29:22,931 --> 00:29:25,599
Actually, our date was chosen randomly.

626
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,641
The Ring-ring Date.

627
00:29:27,211 --> 00:29:28,710
- It almost... - Then the timing worked out.

628
00:29:28,711 --> 00:29:31,910
Made me think if the universe had put us together.

629
00:29:31,911 --> 00:29:33,250
Love is all about timing.

630
00:29:33,651 --> 00:29:35,850
- Right. It's... - I thought the timing was right.

631
00:29:37,921 --> 00:29:40,350
I got a text message from him after that date.

632
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,921
And what he wrote was...

633
00:29:42,151 --> 00:29:44,391
the most heart-fluttering message of all the messages I got here.

634
00:29:44,721 --> 00:29:45,859
(Sharing her excitement)

635
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,030
I'm seeing it firsthand.

636
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:50,201
You're already smiling. You seem very...

637
00:29:54,171 --> 00:29:55,671
- It's the first message. - The snow?

638
00:29:55,871 --> 00:29:57,040
"It's the first snow of the year."

639
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,510
- Did you understand it? - I did.

640
00:30:00,711 --> 00:30:02,470
- What if you didn't understand it? - No, I did.

641
00:30:02,471 --> 00:30:03,539
- You did? - Yes.

642
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:06,141
But I couldn't get any text message the night before.

643
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:08,680
- Right. I got the message that day. - Yes.

644
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:09,681
What does it say?

645
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:11,220
That I didn't get any texts? Or do you not get any text about me?

646
00:30:11,221 --> 00:30:13,121
It said, "Your sibling is doomed."

647
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:16,151
"Is that so?"

648
00:30:18,391 --> 00:30:19,560
"That's good news."

649
00:30:20,731 --> 00:30:22,859
- It sounds like you had fun. - So I was bound to like him more.

650
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:25,799
Seriously. You had a fun day with him.

651
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,070
No wonder. You seemed happy.

652
00:30:27,431 --> 00:30:31,171
I sensed that something had changed with you.

653
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,941
- Did you sense that? - I was slightly aware of that.

654
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:35,441
She was so excited.

655
00:30:35,741 --> 00:30:38,279
It's been a while since I last saw her getting excited...

656
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,481
about someone.

657
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:40,880
Maybe, it might have been...

658
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:44,481
my first time seeing her excited about a guy.

659
00:30:45,181 --> 00:30:46,891
I have good news and bad news.

660
00:30:49,621 --> 00:30:51,790
It's not bad, actually. I have good news.

661
00:30:52,221 --> 00:30:53,790
- Is it Jae Hyung? - You're going with Jae Hyung.

662
00:30:53,931 --> 00:30:56,029
Really? I'm going on another date with Jae Hyung?

663
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:57,030
Yes.

664
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,431
- Really? - Seriously. What is this?

665
00:30:59,631 --> 00:31:00,731
- Really? - Yes.

666
00:31:00,871 --> 00:31:03,131
I thought about how I could explain...

667
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,671
the result to Ju Yeon without hurting her feelings.

668
00:31:05,871 --> 00:31:07,570
It might hurt her feelings.

669
00:31:08,211 --> 00:31:11,580
Ju Yeon told me that she wanted to spend more time...

670
00:31:11,981 --> 00:31:13,381
with Jae Hyung.

671
00:31:13,681 --> 00:31:15,850
I thought this was the right time to tell her the news.

672
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:17,350
"Congratulations."

673
00:31:17,721 --> 00:31:20,050
"You got what you want." That's how I explained the result.

674
00:31:20,721 --> 00:31:22,090
Did you choose my date?

675
00:31:22,491 --> 00:31:24,221
Gosh, I arranged everything for you.

676
00:31:25,621 --> 00:31:26,860
That's a no. You didn't for sure.

677
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:29,090
Then what happened? Hold on. Let's see.

678
00:31:29,431 --> 00:31:30,700
From what I know, we can't go on a date with someone...

679
00:31:30,701 --> 00:31:32,329
- we already had a date with. - Yes, you're right.

680
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:33,830
- So... - But I already had a date with him.

681
00:31:35,701 --> 00:31:39,171
You, Jae Hyung, and Yun Ha will travel together.

682
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:41,671
That's how they grouped you.

683
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,610
- Really? - Yes.

684
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:48,579
At first, it said that my sibling wasn't chosen.

685
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:49,780
- Okay. - Afterwards,

686
00:31:49,951 --> 00:31:51,451
it said you, Yun Ha, and Yun Ha would travel together.

687
00:31:51,651 --> 00:31:54,589
Things might not have aligned for them, so they weren't matched.

688
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:55,620
I see.

689
00:31:55,621 --> 00:31:56,690
From what I observed,

690
00:31:56,691 --> 00:31:57,721
you and Jae Hyung had good chemistry.

691
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,491
So I thought it was good news.

692
00:32:00,731 --> 00:32:01,759
It worked out.

693
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,059
So no one chose me for their date.

694
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:06,230
Thanks to that.

695
00:32:06,231 --> 00:32:08,270
Thanks to that, this happened.

696
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,870
He's telling her that...

697
00:32:10,871 --> 00:32:12,270
- it's actually better this way. - Of course.

698
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,871
- That should be the main focus. - Yes.

699
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:17,741
It might be more fun as a group of three than a pair.

700
00:32:18,681 --> 00:32:21,211
- This all worked out. - I see. I get it now.

701
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:22,749
Have a nice time with them. Have fun.

702
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:25,221
Only looking at the result, this is good news.

703
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,120
A good result is all you need to be happy.

704
00:32:27,121 --> 00:32:28,191
- Right. - Yes.

705
00:32:28,891 --> 00:32:30,221
So the three of you will travel together.

706
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:32,960
- This is good. - That's a bummer.

707
00:32:32,961 --> 00:32:35,060
- That sounds like a fun group. - Yes.

708
00:32:35,391 --> 00:32:36,560
I want to join you guys.

709
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:39,860
- You want to join us on our date? - Yes. Can I?

710
00:32:40,631 --> 00:32:42,471
No one chose me.

711
00:32:44,901 --> 00:32:46,540
That was bad news.

712
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,640
But my brother said...

713
00:32:48,641 --> 00:32:50,981
it didn't matter how it happened as long as the result was good.

714
00:32:51,241 --> 00:32:54,510
He told me it was good news. He put it in a very nice way.

715
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:56,921
I was happy with it.

716
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:00,451
(In another Siblings' Room)

717
00:33:01,621 --> 00:33:02,651
Hi.

718
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,590
It's cold.

719
00:33:10,401 --> 00:33:11,760
Okay. Who is it?

720
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,600
Who am I going on a date with?

721
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:19,040
You will go to Gangwon Province with Yong Woo tomorrow.

722
00:33:20,641 --> 00:33:21,641
- What? - Yes?

723
00:33:21,642 --> 00:33:24,310
- What is it? - Well, nothing.

724
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:25,941
Is he your type?

725
00:33:27,211 --> 00:33:30,421
I think going on a date with him will be fun.

726
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,150
What about you?

727
00:33:32,151 --> 00:33:33,180
- Me? - Yes.

728
00:33:33,181 --> 00:33:34,520
Ju Yeon and Yun Ha.

729
00:33:34,891 --> 00:33:35,921
What?

730
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:38,260
- What are you talking about? - It's the truth.

731
00:33:39,721 --> 00:33:41,631
You went on a date with Ju Yeon for the Ring-ring Date.

732
00:33:42,231 --> 00:33:44,760
Oh, that. I...

733
00:33:44,931 --> 00:33:46,769
failed to be matched on a date.

734
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:48,971
So I'll travel with Ju Yeon and Yun Ha.

735
00:33:53,911 --> 00:33:56,170
These siblings are fun to watch as expected.

736
00:33:56,311 --> 00:33:57,940
Jae Hyung is funny as expected.

737
00:33:58,510 --> 00:33:59,510
(Coughing)

738
00:34:01,951 --> 00:34:02,980
This is fun.

739
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:05,081
Whom did you choose for your date?

740
00:34:05,751 --> 00:34:07,451
- Cho A. - What? Really?

741
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:08,689
- Yes. - Why?

742
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:10,359
It did cross my mind that...

743
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,820
she and I might be compatible in terms of our personalities.

744
00:34:13,121 --> 00:34:14,831
I see. But you failed.

745
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,101
Then...

746
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:20,029
it means her sibling didn't choose you.

747
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:22,331
- Right. - So you weren't chosen.

748
00:34:25,741 --> 00:34:27,610
Then who was your first date?

749
00:34:27,741 --> 00:34:29,210
- My 1st date? It was Yun Ha. - The 1st date.

750
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:30,879
- Really? - Yes.

751
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,939
- I didn't know. - And...

752
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,480
- the second date was with Ju Yeon. - It was Ju Yeon.

753
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:36,351
Which date was more fun for you?

754
00:34:36,751 --> 00:34:37,780
The date with Ju Yeon.

755
00:34:38,221 --> 00:34:39,751
Who's your first pick for now?

756
00:34:42,621 --> 00:34:44,891
How come only you're asking me questions?

757
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,521
Then ask me a question.

758
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,490
Because you keep asking me questions,

759
00:34:48,491 --> 00:34:50,431
I don't have a chance to ask you any questions.

760
00:34:50,601 --> 00:34:51,701
I'll give you three seconds.

761
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,430
You know, our first date was Cupid Date.

762
00:34:55,431 --> 00:34:57,799
Who was your date for that?

763
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,800
Jung Sub.

764
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:06,340
Really?

765
00:35:08,951 --> 00:35:11,050
How come I have such bad hunches?

766
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:14,120
Who did you think was my first date?

767
00:35:14,121 --> 00:35:15,951
- Cheol Hyeon. - I see. Why?

768
00:35:16,351 --> 00:35:18,291
- Just because. - It was just a hunch.

769
00:35:19,991 --> 00:35:24,100
What if the guys didn't have to choose their date?

770
00:35:24,101 --> 00:35:26,831
What if you could choose someone of the four guys?

771
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:28,670
For my date to Gangwon Province.

772
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:31,300
- Whom would you have chosen then? - Jung Sub.

773
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,570
- Really? - I see.

774
00:35:32,871 --> 00:35:33,911
Okay.

775
00:35:35,471 --> 00:35:37,510
For now, do you like Jung Sub?

776
00:35:38,041 --> 00:35:39,181
How serious are you?

777
00:35:40,311 --> 00:35:42,650
- Pretty serious. - Yes. I can tell.

778
00:35:43,621 --> 00:35:45,050
But here's what I think.

779
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:48,820
It's been a while since your last relationship.

780
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:51,391
In the end, you're my family.

781
00:35:51,621 --> 00:35:53,561
Whatever happens,

782
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:57,201
I don't want you to get hurt. That's how I feel.

783
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,460
I'm sure you know that.

784
00:35:59,101 --> 00:36:01,501
Half of me wants things to work out for you.

785
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:04,300
The other half wants you to be more careful.

786
00:36:05,241 --> 00:36:07,771
To be honest, my latter feeling is bigger than the former.

787
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:10,510
I want you to be a bit more careful.

788
00:36:12,541 --> 00:36:14,581
- He's indeed her big brother. - It was nice of him to say that.

789
00:36:14,911 --> 00:36:16,181
All of a sudden, he's acting like a big brother.

790
00:36:16,811 --> 00:36:19,251
I want you to be a bit more careful...

791
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:21,690
because you don't know everyone that deeply yet.

792
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:23,090
- Okay. - Okay.

793
00:36:24,161 --> 00:36:25,590
When he told me that,

794
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,061
it made me realize that I should be a bit more cautious.

795
00:36:28,491 --> 00:36:30,230
At that moment, I became more rational.

796
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,931
"I'm being too hasty."

797
00:36:32,101 --> 00:36:34,400
All of a sudden, I felt calm.

798
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:37,170
It seemed to me that her feelings were deepening.

799
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:41,870
It's been a long time since Se Seung's last relationship.

800
00:36:41,871 --> 00:36:43,509
I was concerned that...

801
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:45,541
she could fall for someone so easily and fast.

802
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:49,411
If she does that, she might get hurt in the end.

803
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:52,021
Well, I'm on my sister's side.

804
00:36:52,851 --> 00:36:54,319
This was the intended effect...

805
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,751
- of having a brother there. - Jae Hyung!

806
00:36:55,891 --> 00:36:57,460
- Jae Hyung is incredible. - He's such a big brother.

807
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:00,330
See? Even her brother thinks she's moving too fast.

808
00:37:00,331 --> 00:37:01,630
- She's too hasty. - Yes.

809
00:37:01,791 --> 00:37:03,530
All of a sudden, he sounds like a big brother.

810
00:37:03,701 --> 00:37:05,899
Yes. Jae Hyung can be mature too.

811
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,201
Yes. You're right.

812
00:37:07,971 --> 00:37:09,970
So which one is your favourite out of the four?

813
00:37:09,971 --> 00:37:11,070
What do you think?

814
00:37:11,241 --> 00:37:12,770
- Me? Who is my favourite? - No, my favourite.

815
00:37:12,771 --> 00:37:14,210
- In your eyes... - I thought it was Ju Yeon.

816
00:37:14,471 --> 00:37:15,840
- Why? - You seem at ease with her.

817
00:37:16,471 --> 00:37:18,311
Your personalities seem to be compatible.

818
00:37:18,641 --> 00:37:20,010
Actually, in the beginning,

819
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:22,609
I had a hard time realizing my own thoughts.

820
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:23,851
Because of that,

821
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:27,721
I want to be more cautious.

822
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:30,590
(Cho A and Cheol Hyeon's Siblings' Room)

823
00:37:31,661 --> 00:37:32,721
How is it?

824
00:37:33,121 --> 00:37:34,161
- Me? - Yes.

825
00:37:34,891 --> 00:37:37,130
- I'm happy. - Are you interested in anyone?

826
00:37:39,431 --> 00:37:40,730
What do you think about Ji Won?

827
00:37:40,931 --> 00:37:43,069
She's very calm.

828
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:44,141
- I could see that. - Yes.

829
00:37:44,371 --> 00:37:46,470
I wonder if there's a side of her I didn't expect to see.

830
00:37:46,471 --> 00:37:48,570
- I see. Okay. - I want to discover that.

831
00:37:48,911 --> 00:37:50,070
I wonder what she's like.

832
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:52,040
- I'm curious about her. - Once she gets comfortable?

833
00:37:52,041 --> 00:37:53,041
Yes.

834
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:55,880
What about you? Is there someone you like?

835
00:37:56,181 --> 00:37:58,450
I think there are two people...

836
00:37:58,451 --> 00:38:00,181
- who might be a good match to you. - Right.

837
00:38:00,451 --> 00:38:02,951
You know the guy we talked about the first time we met...

838
00:38:03,451 --> 00:38:05,189
in the Siblings' Room?

839
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:06,959
- But instead of him, - Yes.

840
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,090
Are you more curious about a new guy now?

841
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:11,260
- Yes. - I see.

842
00:38:12,201 --> 00:38:14,629
- The guy I have in mind... - Yes.

843
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:16,300
- tends to make a lot of jokes. - Yes.

844
00:38:16,601 --> 00:38:19,771
Are we not allowed to say his name?

845
00:38:20,371 --> 00:38:21,840
In the beginning...

846
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:24,380
There are two guys on the list for my future brother-in-law.

847
00:38:24,641 --> 00:38:26,880
I had a feeling that...

848
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:30,251
she spent some time today with the second guy on the list.

849
00:38:30,581 --> 00:38:31,851
Whom are you talking about?

850
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:33,379
Yong Woo.

851
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,819
- Can I say his name? - Yes.

852
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:38,359
I didn't mention his name to my sister just in case.

853
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,491
So I numbered them instead.

854
00:38:41,291 --> 00:38:45,800
When we first met in the room, she talked about Jung Sub a lot.

855
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:48,871
Next, Yong Woo seemed like a great guy.

856
00:38:49,331 --> 00:38:53,270
Anyway, as for the first guy I talked about,

857
00:38:53,271 --> 00:38:56,110
something about him felt familiar in the beginning.

858
00:38:56,271 --> 00:38:58,510
He talked to me first.

859
00:38:58,681 --> 00:39:01,979
I told you that he established eye contact with me quite well.

860
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:04,050
- Right. - Yes. He did that.

861
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:08,251
But that didn't happen with the second guy.

862
00:39:08,391 --> 00:39:10,891
So his behaviour felt a bit cold toward me.

863
00:39:11,121 --> 00:39:12,760
It was harder to approach him.

864
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:16,189
Did you guys meet in private and talk?

865
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:18,300
- Yes. - How was it?

866
00:39:18,561 --> 00:39:20,770
- After talking to him, - Okay.

867
00:39:20,771 --> 00:39:22,470
I noticed different sides of him.

868
00:39:22,471 --> 00:39:24,940
Was he different when he was with you in private?

869
00:39:25,141 --> 00:39:26,900
Yes, that was a part of it too.

870
00:39:27,641 --> 00:39:31,181
First of all, he's a good communicator.

871
00:39:31,681 --> 00:39:33,680
- I agree. - You know, some people...

872
00:39:33,681 --> 00:39:35,580
- can be considerate while talking. - Yes.

873
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:38,681
I felt that he was very thoughtful and considerate.

874
00:39:39,121 --> 00:39:42,221
When it was just the two of us, that side of him showed.

875
00:39:42,621 --> 00:39:44,859
I think both guys would be compatible with you.

876
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:45,890
- Both of them? - But...

877
00:39:45,891 --> 00:39:46,920
they're different kinds of people.

878
00:39:47,061 --> 00:39:48,629
What do you like about the first guy?

879
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:50,089
And what do you like about the second guy?

880
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:52,130
The first guy is very passionate about you.

881
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:55,230
He seems more willing to take initiative to get to know you.

882
00:39:55,431 --> 00:39:59,101
Personally, I sensed that he was quite serious about you.

883
00:39:59,201 --> 00:40:02,041
- I see. He was? Really? - He was... Yes. The first guy.

884
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:04,709
He wants to do more things with you.

885
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:08,050
I felt that he wanted to get to know you more.

886
00:40:08,681 --> 00:40:11,150
But as for the second guy, he has a great personality.

887
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:13,279
He's a great guy.

888
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,620
But here's my opinion about him.

889
00:40:14,621 --> 00:40:15,850
You said he knew...

890
00:40:15,851 --> 00:40:17,121
- how to talk to people. - Yes.

891
00:40:17,391 --> 00:40:19,890
He can adjust his behaviour if someone is in a bad mood.

892
00:40:19,891 --> 00:40:22,530
During serious conversations, he can be serious and all.

893
00:40:22,661 --> 00:40:24,259
- That's not easy. - Right.

894
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:27,229
But if you think about it, he can do the same to other people.

895
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:31,570
I tried to give my sister advice when we were in the room.

896
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:35,371
I tried to advise her as a guy on some things she might've missed.

897
00:40:36,241 --> 00:40:38,880
Yong Woo is a great guy.

898
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:41,480
But he might be good to everyone.

899
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:45,021
He has fun, is witty, and makes people comfortable.

900
00:40:46,121 --> 00:40:47,149
If he's interested in someone,

901
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:48,791
shouldn't he behave somewhat differently?

902
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:51,960
Try to see how he treats you differently.

903
00:40:52,621 --> 00:40:53,930
It might not be a bad idea...

904
00:40:53,931 --> 00:40:56,360
to think about how differently he behaves when he's with you.

905
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:57,859
Some moments...

906
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:00,330
come to my mind after hearing your advice.

907
00:41:00,331 --> 00:41:03,700
The first guy asks me more questions.

908
00:41:03,701 --> 00:41:04,701
Yes.

909
00:41:04,702 --> 00:41:06,840
- He wants to do things with me. - Yes.

910
00:41:07,271 --> 00:41:09,910
But with the second guy,

911
00:41:09,911 --> 00:41:13,340
I find myself asking more questions than him.

912
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:17,850
I think Yong Woo gets along with everyone.

913
00:41:17,851 --> 00:41:22,550
In my opinion, it's a double-edged sword.

914
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:25,790
I personally think there's a limit...

915
00:41:25,791 --> 00:41:29,190
to people who are good to and get along with everyone.

916
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:30,560
I get the feeling that he'd invest...

917
00:41:30,561 --> 00:41:32,260
the same amount of affection on everyone.

918
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:35,431
Let's say my sister is in a relationship with someone.

919
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,669
Then someone with Jung Sub's personality...

920
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:38,971
might be better for her.

921
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,041
So we're going to Gangwon Province on a trip.

922
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:45,280
You'll be going with Jung Sub.

923
00:41:46,181 --> 00:41:49,549
Remember what I said about him, and try to get to know him more.

924
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:52,581
Then did you pick him for my date?

925
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:54,420
Yes. I did.

926
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:56,690
Two people chose you.

927
00:41:56,791 --> 00:41:59,959
In a way, I had a meeting with the two of them.

928
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:02,430
I asked them questions like why they liked you and so on.

929
00:42:02,431 --> 00:42:04,630
Then they gave me their answers.

930
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,830
His answers sounded more genuine.

931
00:42:06,831 --> 00:42:08,930
He seemed more enthusiastic about spending time with you.

932
00:42:08,931 --> 00:42:10,529
First of all, he was very chatty.

933
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:12,000
I was supposed to ask him questions.

934
00:42:12,001 --> 00:42:14,210
But he asked me so many questions instead.

935
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:15,610
I see.

936
00:42:15,611 --> 00:42:17,879
I could sense his passion...

937
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,879
and desire to win you over from his attitude.

938
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,710
- You sensed his passion? - Yes.

939
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,811
"I must win her over."

940
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,681
- I felt that. - I see.

941
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:30,891
I did expect to a certain degree that Jung Sub would choose me.

942
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:35,290
Even before this, he expressed his interest in me.

943
00:42:35,291 --> 00:42:39,330
When I mentioned small things, he didn't miss them.

944
00:42:39,331 --> 00:42:42,230
I could feel pretty clearly that he took an interest in me.

945
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:43,899
(Yun Ha and Jung Sub's Siblings' Room)

946
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:46,271
- Hi. - Hi.

947
00:42:48,411 --> 00:42:49,541
Weren't you cold?

948
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,480
I'm fine.

949
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:55,210
- Here. - Thank you.

950
00:42:55,911 --> 00:42:57,521
Have you decided on one person?

951
00:43:00,751 --> 00:43:01,791
Tell me.

952
00:43:02,721 --> 00:43:03,820
How's the new girl?

953
00:43:04,391 --> 00:43:05,690
- The new girl? - What do you think?

954
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,089
She's nice.

955
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:08,390
- Right? - How did you know?

956
00:43:08,391 --> 00:43:10,661
I knew it right away.

957
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:14,430
Ji Won is quiet for now.

958
00:43:14,431 --> 00:43:16,100
I thought...

959
00:43:16,101 --> 00:43:17,939
I could get to know her pretty fast once we started talking.

960
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:20,641
I was a bit curious about her too. That's how I felt.

961
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:22,340
I wanted to talk to her.

962
00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:24,379
- I bet you can't make up your mind. - Gosh. Seriously?

963
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:25,411
How did you know?

964
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:27,581
- How could I not know? - Seriously.

965
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:29,150
I'm your sister.

966
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:31,580
- So I need to tell you something. - Okay.

967
00:43:31,581 --> 00:43:33,649
Don't be so disappointed by this.

968
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:34,751
- Okay. - Okay.

969
00:43:35,291 --> 00:43:36,351
Yun Ha.

970
00:43:36,991 --> 00:43:40,931
As for your date to Gangwon Province,

971
00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:44,230
the three of you will travel together.

972
00:43:45,431 --> 00:43:46,530
- I see. - So...

973
00:43:46,931 --> 00:43:49,431
- There are three of us. - here's what's interesting.

974
00:43:50,101 --> 00:43:51,640
Jae Hyung...

975
00:43:51,641 --> 00:43:53,701
- Yes. - and Ju Yeon will join you.

976
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:57,340
So what happened?

977
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:00,779
Here's what I think. Our choices were limited.

978
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:02,180
How did this happen?

979
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:04,549
- The four of us had to exclude... - Yes.

980
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:07,319
The people we had the Cupid Date and the Ring-ring Date with.

981
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:08,820
- We had to choose someone new. - That's right.

982
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:10,291
I chose Cho A.

983
00:44:10,491 --> 00:44:12,090
- I see. - Yes.

984
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:16,161
Jae Hyung couldn't choose you.

985
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:18,661
Cheol Hyeon couldn't choose you either.

986
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:20,660
- I see. - So The only person...

987
00:44:20,661 --> 00:44:22,201
I could choose was Yong Woo.

988
00:44:22,331 --> 00:44:24,540
I think he chose someone else.

989
00:44:24,541 --> 00:44:27,271
So I wasn't chosen again?

990
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:28,710
It's okay.

991
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:33,209
I'm okay because it's my fault.

992
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:34,250
She must have had her hopes up...

993
00:44:34,251 --> 00:44:36,751
because she'd been into Yong Woo...

994
00:44:36,951 --> 00:44:39,780
from the start.

995
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:42,790
I see. So Yun Ha has been showing interest in Yong Woo.

996
00:44:42,791 --> 00:44:44,919
- She sent him a Cupid Message too. - Right.

997
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:45,960
She sent him a text as well.

998
00:44:46,521 --> 00:44:49,660
I'm okay because it's my fault.

999
00:44:49,661 --> 00:44:51,900
No, it's not.

1000
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:53,300
You should survive, at least.

1001
00:44:58,271 --> 00:45:01,140
When I told her about the results, she didn't seem happy.

1002
00:45:01,141 --> 00:45:04,741
I caught the slight change in her look in a moment.

1003
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:06,480
Honestly, I understand why she could be upset,

1004
00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:09,710
(The four groups of siblings finished talking.)

1005
00:45:09,851 --> 00:45:11,250
- Anyone wants a beer? - Me.

1006
00:45:11,251 --> 00:45:13,880
- Welcome to the house. - Do you want it?

1007
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:15,521
When are you coming tomorrow?

1008
00:45:15,891 --> 00:45:18,959
I'll be home around 7pm.

1009
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,931
So do you leave at 9am?

1010
00:45:21,061 --> 00:45:23,229
- At 9:30am. - Do you have to leave at that time?

1011
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:25,700
I think I should wake up at 8:30am.

1012
00:45:25,701 --> 00:45:27,129
- She might get tipsy. - If I'm too quiet...

1013
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:28,900
when you're passing by my room...

1014
00:45:28,931 --> 00:45:30,100
(Shaking)

1015
00:45:30,101 --> 00:45:31,169
Okay.

1016
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:32,400
How do you want me to wake you up?

1017
00:45:33,371 --> 00:45:34,911
Ask me, "Do you want to get fired?"

1018
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:37,640
- When is your birthday? - When is your birthday?

1019
00:45:37,641 --> 00:45:38,880
July 1.

1020
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:40,780
- Someone's birthday was July 1 too. - What?

1021
00:45:41,050 --> 00:45:43,180
No way. My birthday is July 1 too.

1022
00:45:43,181 --> 00:45:45,350
- Really? - I told you.

1023
00:45:45,351 --> 00:45:46,750
This is crazy. What is this?

1024
00:45:46,751 --> 00:45:48,290
- You have a great memory. - It's fascinating.

1025
00:45:48,291 --> 00:45:49,750
- My birthday is July 1. - It's crazy.

1026
00:45:49,751 --> 00:45:51,490
- This is insane. - For real?

1027
00:45:51,491 --> 00:45:53,120
We should throw a joint birthday party.

1028
00:45:53,121 --> 00:45:54,759
This never happened to me before.

1029
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:56,729
I see. It's amazing.

1030
00:45:56,730 --> 00:45:59,100
I'm shocked now.

1031
00:45:59,101 --> 00:46:00,160
- Shall we go to sleep now? - Yes.

1032
00:46:00,161 --> 00:46:01,200
- Shall we? - We have to...

1033
00:46:01,201 --> 00:46:03,331
- wake up early tomorrow. - For tomorrow.

1034
00:46:03,831 --> 00:46:06,641
(Cheol Hyeon bumps into her sister on the 2nd floor.)

1035
00:46:08,471 --> 00:46:10,339
Ji Won and I have the same birthday.

1036
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:12,411
- Really? - This never happened before.

1037
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:14,450
- For real? - Yes.

1038
00:46:14,451 --> 00:46:16,310
Who told you that?

1039
00:46:16,311 --> 00:46:19,081
We were talking about her birthday just now.

1040
00:46:19,721 --> 00:46:21,521
I've never met anyone with the same birthday before.

1041
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:24,459
Did you feel like it was destiny?

1042
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:26,120
Well, it's just interesting.

1043
00:46:26,121 --> 00:46:27,830
I think she's a good person, though.

1044
00:46:27,831 --> 00:46:29,430
Do you have a feeling?

1045
00:46:29,431 --> 00:46:31,460
We talked more than I thought.

1046
00:46:33,101 --> 00:46:34,170
I wish you luck.

1047
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:35,730
Thanks.

1048
00:46:39,141 --> 00:46:41,940
(Cho A is making a note before going to sleep.)

1049
00:46:42,141 --> 00:46:44,640
- What are you writing? - Things to prepare tomorrow.

1050
00:46:44,641 --> 00:46:45,681
Really?

1051
00:46:46,581 --> 00:46:47,950
Are you good at tennis?

1052
00:46:47,951 --> 00:46:49,010
Tennis?

1053
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:51,050
That's out of the blue.

1054
00:46:51,051 --> 00:46:52,780
Will we play tennis there?

1055
00:46:53,451 --> 00:46:54,451
Is that so?

1056
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:57,490
Jung Sub is so different...

1057
00:46:57,491 --> 00:46:59,589
when he's with Se Seung and Cho A.

1058
00:46:59,590 --> 00:47:00,890
- He's a little different, right? - Did you notice?

1059
00:47:00,891 --> 00:47:02,660
He was answering with his eyes.

1060
00:47:02,661 --> 00:47:04,399
- Hold on. - Did you see that?

1061
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:07,400
He's doing what Se Seung is doing to him.

1062
00:47:08,331 --> 00:47:09,529
- Se Seung... - He's in her shoes now.

1063
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:11,069
Se Seung looked at him like that.

1064
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:13,339
Did you see how he answered with his eyes?

1065
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:15,740
- He's about to become Se Seung. - He's so flirty.

1066
00:47:15,741 --> 00:47:16,939
- That came out naturally. - Look at his face...

1067
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:18,640
when she asked,

1068
00:47:18,641 --> 00:47:19,980
"Will we play tennis in Gangwon Province?"

1069
00:47:20,081 --> 00:47:21,710
Will we play tennis there?

1070
00:47:22,251 --> 00:47:23,311
Is that so?

1071
00:47:23,581 --> 00:47:25,380
I've never played tennis before.

1072
00:47:26,081 --> 00:47:28,549
I've played it once, and it was so hard.

1073
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:29,689
It sounds like fun, though.

1074
00:47:29,690 --> 00:47:31,460
- It sounds fun. - I see.

1075
00:47:31,991 --> 00:47:33,820
I heard you liked coffee.

1076
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:34,930
Yes, I love it.

1077
00:47:34,931 --> 00:47:37,161
It doesn't agree with you, but you like it.

1078
00:47:37,431 --> 00:47:38,931
Who told you that?

1079
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:41,799
I've been asking around.

1080
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:42,931
He's looking into her eyes.

1081
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:45,371
He's making direct eye contact.

1082
00:47:45,501 --> 00:47:47,839
He barely did that with Se Seung.

1083
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:50,009
- Excuse me. - He's doing it naturally...

1084
00:47:50,010 --> 00:47:51,379
- Sir. - because he's into her.

1085
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:53,109
- All right. - Okay.

1086
00:47:53,110 --> 00:47:55,080
She says that often. She's asking him to stop talking.

1087
00:47:55,081 --> 00:47:56,279
We're here to talk,

1088
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:58,220
and you're asking me to stop talking.

1089
00:47:58,221 --> 00:47:59,650
Let's keep watching the clip.

1090
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:01,391
I've been trying to see his face.

1091
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:03,251
Who told you that?

1092
00:48:04,891 --> 00:48:06,089
I've been asking around.

1093
00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:07,561
- Really? - Yes.

1094
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:10,589
I love coffee even though it doesn't agree with me.

1095
00:48:10,590 --> 00:48:12,959
I'm trying to cut it down.

1096
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,500
I see. If you're going to drink it,

1097
00:48:15,501 --> 00:48:17,840
you should drink good coffee.

1098
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:20,770
So I thought we could go to a good coffee place.

1099
00:48:20,771 --> 00:48:22,939
We can go to a café there too.

1100
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:23,971
Yes.

1101
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:25,241
- "Yes." - Yes.

1102
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:29,879
- Oh, dear. - What is that?

1103
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:30,880
- Goodness. - He was being cute.

1104
00:48:30,881 --> 00:48:33,819
- He's so funny. - Why is he different?

1105
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:34,850
- What is this? - "Yes."

1106
00:48:34,851 --> 00:48:36,919
- It looks like... - He's being shy.

1107
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:39,160
His energy level matches hers better...

1108
00:48:39,161 --> 00:48:40,759
considering his personality.

1109
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:43,959
- Jung Sub is the affectionate type. - Yes.

1110
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:46,299
Se Seung is also very affectionate with him when they're together.

1111
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:48,229
- They can't act cute together. - Right.

1112
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:49,899
I feel like...

1113
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:52,439
- That sounds possible. - his true self comes out more here.

1114
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:53,939
The two were curious...

1115
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:55,640
- about each other, though. - Right.

1116
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:57,940
- They're finally matched in a way. - Yes.

1117
00:48:58,681 --> 00:49:01,911
(Everyone is sleeping at night.)

1118
00:49:07,221 --> 00:49:10,590
(Then Ji Won is headed somewhere alone.)

1119
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:18,331
(Entering the Siblings' Room without knowing anything)

1120
00:49:20,561 --> 00:49:25,001
(Ji Won doesn't know what this room is for.)

1121
00:49:33,241 --> 00:49:34,379
"What am I doing sitting here?"

1122
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:36,250
"Am I going to meet another participant?"

1123
00:49:36,251 --> 00:49:37,681
I was wondering, then...

1124
00:49:38,621 --> 00:49:39,621
(Door opening)

1125
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:41,991
What?

1126
00:49:42,690 --> 00:49:44,460
- Gosh. - What are you doing here?

1127
00:49:48,661 --> 00:49:51,360
Gosh. Why are you wearing such heavy makeup?

1128
00:49:52,730 --> 00:49:54,870
- My goodness. - They're indeed siblings.

1129
00:49:54,871 --> 00:49:56,270
- That was so real. - He's her sibling.

1130
00:49:56,271 --> 00:49:58,741
- That reaction was so real. - You're her sibling for sure.

1131
00:49:58,871 --> 00:50:02,310
That's what I say to my sister all the time.

1132
00:50:02,311 --> 00:50:03,371
Gosh.

1133
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:07,509
- When did you get here? - Just snow.

1134
00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:09,280
- You just got here? - Yes.

1135
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:12,050
My family...

1136
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:14,689
isn't like, "My daughter! My mom!"

1137
00:50:14,690 --> 00:50:17,919
We're not really affectionate with each other.

1138
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,390
We love each other deeply,

1139
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:22,990
but we don't really express it on the outside.

1140
00:50:22,991 --> 00:50:24,030
I was like, "What?"

1141
00:50:24,501 --> 00:50:26,161
That's why I reacted like that.

1142
00:50:26,601 --> 00:50:29,129
I was worried for a second...

1143
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:31,900
that she would be nervous.

1144
00:50:32,371 --> 00:50:34,541
As soon as I opened the door, I didn't like seeing her.

1145
00:50:34,741 --> 00:50:36,870
From what I think,

1146
00:50:36,871 --> 00:50:40,280
brothers and sisters don't typically miss each other.

1147
00:50:40,510 --> 00:50:42,750
I've never imagined...

1148
00:50:42,751 --> 00:50:44,110
a brother and sister being sweet to each other.

1149
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:46,649
It's cringy to be sweet to her too.

1150
00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:48,049
Even if I'm happy to see her,

1151
00:50:48,050 --> 00:50:49,891
I'm like, "Gosh. I hate seeing her."

1152
00:50:50,550 --> 00:50:52,090
"Your makeup is weird today."

1153
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:54,730
"You look especially ugly today."

1154
00:50:57,431 --> 00:50:58,501
I can relate.

1155
00:50:58,630 --> 00:50:59,930
- I knew it. - That's so satisfying.

1156
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:01,729
That's so liberating.

1157
00:51:01,730 --> 00:51:03,600
That's what siblings are supposed to be, though.

1158
00:51:03,601 --> 00:51:05,040
- That's the correct vibe. - Yes.

1159
00:51:05,041 --> 00:51:07,399
I've never said, "I love you,"

1160
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,210
to my sister.

1161
00:51:09,610 --> 00:51:12,640
All my friends were like that with their siblings too.

1162
00:51:12,641 --> 00:51:13,880
- I see. - Right.

1163
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,709
Why are you wearing such heavy makeup? Make it lighter.

1164
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:18,721
- My makeup? - Yes. It's too heavy.

1165
00:51:19,550 --> 00:51:21,650
You look scary like that.

1166
00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:24,121
Why do you care?

1167
00:51:24,351 --> 00:51:25,391
How is it?

1168
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:26,960
Are you being shy?

1169
00:51:27,661 --> 00:51:30,589
- Are you really shy? - No. There's no time for that.

1170
00:51:30,590 --> 00:51:32,430
It's because you're not really talkative.

1171
00:51:32,431 --> 00:51:34,830
- Did they say I was shy? - Yes. They said...

1172
00:51:34,831 --> 00:51:36,169
- you seemed shy. - I see.

1173
00:51:36,170 --> 00:51:37,970
But I think...

1174
00:51:37,971 --> 00:51:41,101
I asked many questions when I was on a date yesterday.

1175
00:51:41,371 --> 00:51:42,440
That's what you think.

1176
00:51:42,811 --> 00:51:44,339
No, I actually did.

1177
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:47,241
They're all precious children to their parents. Treat them well.

1178
00:51:47,951 --> 00:51:49,411
Hey. You don't know...

1179
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:53,320
how smoothly I led the conversation yesterday.

1180
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:56,649
- They're all precious children. - Mind your own business.

1181
00:51:56,650 --> 00:51:58,791
I'm worried about you since you're moving in soon.

1182
00:52:00,161 --> 00:52:01,331
Well,

1183
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,991
you're always worried about our family and me.

1184
00:52:04,501 --> 00:52:05,760
Is there anyone you're into?

1185
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:07,030
(Yawning)

1186
00:52:07,331 --> 00:52:09,670
- Anyone I'm into? - Who seems like a good person?

1187
00:52:10,201 --> 00:52:11,271
I'm not sure for now.

1188
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:13,371
Goodness.

1189
00:52:13,971 --> 00:52:15,010
What?

1190
00:52:18,610 --> 00:52:19,610
Oh. boy.

1191
00:52:20,411 --> 00:52:21,480
What's wrong?

1192
00:52:23,110 --> 00:52:24,251
Gosh.

1193
00:52:26,451 --> 00:52:27,521
I love it.

1194
00:52:27,951 --> 00:52:29,990
He might say, "Behave yourself..."

1195
00:52:29,991 --> 00:52:31,491
- "and don't embarrass our family." - Right.

1196
00:52:31,791 --> 00:52:34,991
We never speak nicely to each other.

1197
00:52:35,161 --> 00:52:37,129
We're a little grumpy.

1198
00:52:37,130 --> 00:52:39,930
We can't stand it if we're sweet to each other...

1199
00:52:39,931 --> 00:52:41,061
in any way.

1200
00:52:41,701 --> 00:52:44,501
I'm usually the one who gets on her nerves.

1201
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,741
She's just there, and I go annoy her.

1202
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:49,840
It's my own way of breaking the ice with Ji Won.

1203
00:52:50,041 --> 00:52:52,840
It's to casually start a conversation with her.

1204
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:56,450
I just wanted to check if you were doing well.

1205
00:52:56,451 --> 00:52:59,650
Doing well? Once you move in,

1206
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:01,221
- It's not bad? - you adjust quickly.

1207
00:53:01,791 --> 00:53:03,920
You don't have to be that nervous.

1208
00:53:04,021 --> 00:53:05,920
There's no time for that, anyway.

1209
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:07,790
- And you go to sleep... - I knew you'd do great...

1210
00:53:07,791 --> 00:53:09,030
as the oldest son in our family.

1211
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:13,260
Good luck!

1212
00:53:14,061 --> 00:53:17,570
(One month ago)

1213
00:53:17,771 --> 00:53:19,569
You two are one year apart, right?

1214
00:53:19,570 --> 00:53:20,601
- Correct. - Yes.

1215
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:23,370
When siblings are one year apart, they barely use honorifics.

1216
00:53:23,371 --> 00:53:26,979
Right. I used honorifics with him...

1217
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:28,650
- less than ten times. - Right.

1218
00:53:28,811 --> 00:53:31,780
She's using honorifics just because you're here.

1219
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,150
Usually, it's just, "Hey."

1220
00:53:35,090 --> 00:53:36,120
I'm the oldest son in the family,

1221
00:53:36,121 --> 00:53:37,590
but I think it's actually her.

1222
00:53:38,190 --> 00:53:39,190
The oldest "son?"

1223
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:42,790
When they were born,

1224
00:53:42,791 --> 00:53:45,430
my son was small, and my daughter was chubbier.

1225
00:53:45,431 --> 00:53:47,359
They were like twins.

1226
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:48,629
(The brother and sister were like twins.)

1227
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:51,000
There's a video of my daughter's first birthday,

1228
00:53:51,001 --> 00:53:53,270
and in the video, my son is whining.

1229
00:53:53,271 --> 00:53:55,709
He is wearing a bow tie for his sister's first birthday,

1230
00:53:55,710 --> 00:53:57,140
but he's also a baby.

1231
00:53:57,141 --> 00:53:58,580
"Mom, hold me."

1232
00:53:58,581 --> 00:54:00,311
He kept whining since he was only one year older.

1233
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:03,149
He was our first child,

1234
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:04,779
but he was always like a baby.

1235
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:05,951
When they entered school,

1236
00:54:06,150 --> 00:54:08,521
my daughter took care of him.

1237
00:54:08,751 --> 00:54:09,919
She was resourceful.

1238
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:11,790
When Yun Jae used up his allowance,

1239
00:54:11,791 --> 00:54:13,760
he would ask her for some money, and Ji Won shared hers with him.

1240
00:54:14,021 --> 00:54:16,259
He would bury his face on the desk and cry about ruining an exam.

1241
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:17,590
Then she would look after him.

1242
00:54:18,661 --> 00:54:20,601
- Your sister is more mature. - Yes.

1243
00:54:21,701 --> 00:54:24,400
When someone says I'm the oldest son at a gathering,

1244
00:54:24,741 --> 00:54:25,800
I'm like, "What are you talking about?"

1245
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:28,110
I could even call her my big sister now.

1246
00:54:29,371 --> 00:54:31,209
He was so nice to me for about three months...

1247
00:54:31,210 --> 00:54:33,041
after he was discharged from the military.

1248
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:34,879
He would call me and say,

1249
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,049
"Now that I'm here,"

1250
00:54:36,050 --> 00:54:38,680
"I miss you a lot."

1251
00:54:38,681 --> 00:54:40,549
"I gave you..."

1252
00:54:40,550 --> 00:54:41,550
Everyone does that when they are in the military.

1253
00:54:41,551 --> 00:54:42,690
"such a hard time."

1254
00:54:43,121 --> 00:54:44,121
I was bored.

1255
00:54:46,491 --> 00:54:47,860
My brother and I are one year apart too.

1256
00:54:48,061 --> 00:54:50,260
- Me too. - We fought like crazy.

1257
00:54:51,190 --> 00:54:53,360
Once I remove makeup, you can see lots of claw marks here.

1258
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:55,069
My brother scratched my face a lot when we were kids.

1259
00:54:55,070 --> 00:54:57,430
I have a scar somewhere on my chin.

1260
00:54:57,431 --> 00:54:59,439
- Was it your sister? - It's from a fight with my sister.

1261
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,371
My face is slightly asymmetrical...

1262
00:55:01,570 --> 00:55:02,970
- Did he punch you? - because he punched me.

1263
00:55:02,971 --> 00:55:04,040
What's with all the siblings?

1264
00:55:04,041 --> 00:55:06,240
- Patricia, you can't say that. - What's with brothers and sisters?

1265
00:55:06,241 --> 00:55:07,979
- My face is asymmetrical. - But it could have been...

1266
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:09,980
- a meridian massage, - A meridian massage?

1267
00:55:10,351 --> 00:55:11,351
Patricia really needed...

1268
00:55:11,352 --> 00:55:13,250
- a meridian massage at that time. - It's because...

1269
00:55:13,251 --> 00:55:14,620
She needed it every day during that time.

1270
00:55:14,621 --> 00:55:15,750
You should have done it on the other side too.

1271
00:55:15,751 --> 00:55:18,460
I'm sorry. I've never seen anyone with such a symmetrical face.

1272
00:55:19,391 --> 00:55:21,161
- Was it fixed at that time? - Yes.

1273
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:22,431
I fixed it.

1274
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:24,730
- I see. - You made it symmetrical.

1275
00:55:24,831 --> 00:55:26,160
I realized it just now.

1276
00:55:26,161 --> 00:55:27,529
- I took one uppercut. - I see.

1277
00:55:27,530 --> 00:55:29,100
It was my brother's love.

1278
00:55:29,101 --> 00:55:30,799
- Jonathan is strong. - I know.

1279
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:33,371
- My brother's love. - It's so funny.

1280
00:55:33,670 --> 00:55:36,210
(How did you two start studying abroad?)

1281
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:39,339
I went abroad to study when I was 12.

1282
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:40,740
It was to Canada.

1283
00:55:40,741 --> 00:55:44,209
He began studying abroad with me...

1284
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:46,550
when he went to high school.

1285
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:48,820
We lived together when we were in college.

1286
00:55:49,251 --> 00:55:51,959
We would talk while eating and drinking together.

1287
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:53,890
We had a lot of time like that.

1288
00:55:53,891 --> 00:55:56,859
We would get along and often fight too...

1289
00:55:56,860 --> 00:55:58,501
when we were studying abroad together.

1290
00:55:58,831 --> 00:56:00,959
We're busy these days,

1291
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,830
so we barely fight.

1292
00:56:02,831 --> 00:56:05,541
If we spend more time together, we might fight again.

1293
00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:10,340
You've dated each other's friends?

1294
00:56:11,210 --> 00:56:12,710
For real?

1295
00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:14,379
- What? - They told each other?

1296
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:15,609
- What? - Is that true?

1297
00:56:15,610 --> 00:56:17,379
- Each other's friends? - I see.

1298
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:19,620
They both did it.

1299
00:56:19,621 --> 00:56:20,750
It's like...

1300
00:56:20,751 --> 00:56:22,290
- they already shot this show. - Right.

1301
00:56:22,291 --> 00:56:24,189
It's like my sister dated my friend.

1302
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:25,460
- Both. - They both did that.

1303
00:56:25,661 --> 00:56:28,560
It's not something wrong,

1304
00:56:28,561 --> 00:56:30,359
- but it's a little weird. - It's a weird relationship.

1305
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:32,359
It wasn't wrong,

1306
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:34,501
but it would have been better if they had done something bad.

1307
00:56:35,101 --> 00:56:36,170
- I think so. - I agree.

1308
00:56:36,971 --> 00:56:38,030
Right.

1309
00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:41,471
(Have you two dated each other's friends?)

1310
00:56:42,411 --> 00:56:43,471
Did you tell them?

1311
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:47,339
It was hard when they broke up.

1312
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:49,310
My friend was struggling after a breakup,

1313
00:56:49,311 --> 00:56:50,581
but it was with my sister.

1314
00:56:51,311 --> 00:56:54,121
So I couldn't really criticize her with him.

1315
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:56,450
My friend was shrewd...

1316
00:56:56,451 --> 00:56:58,160
and had good grades at school.

1317
00:56:58,161 --> 00:57:00,161
I saw him being smacked on the back by her.

1318
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:02,129
She was like, "I told you not to sleep during class."

1319
00:57:02,130 --> 00:57:05,030
And he responded timidly, "Okay."

1320
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:09,130
He was never timid like that with our family.

1321
00:57:09,771 --> 00:57:10,831
"I don't like seeing that."

1322
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:13,300
That's what I thought.

1323
00:57:13,301 --> 00:57:15,041
(Yun Jae, have you been on a blind date?)

1324
00:57:15,311 --> 00:57:18,480
I have, but I was terrible.

1325
00:57:19,241 --> 00:57:21,609
I didn't know what kind of conversation to have...

1326
00:57:21,610 --> 00:57:24,311
because I didn't really have a way with words.

1327
00:57:24,581 --> 00:57:26,480
I watched videos online for 3 to 4 hours...

1328
00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:28,221
to learn how to converse well.

1329
00:57:28,721 --> 00:57:30,649
I learned somehow and went on the date,

1330
00:57:30,650 --> 00:57:33,260
but I couldn't really talk as smoothly as I thought.

1331
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:35,030
I was honest with my date and told her,

1332
00:57:35,130 --> 00:57:36,931
"I watched videos about conversing, but I can't do well."

1333
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:41,529
I don't know. I haven't dated in three years,

1334
00:57:41,530 --> 00:57:43,070
so I don't know what to tell you.

1335
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:45,141
I even forgot how to have a conversation.

1336
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:47,040
I wonder who you will choose...

1337
00:57:47,041 --> 00:57:49,271
when you first move in.

1338
00:57:49,510 --> 00:57:52,340
Is there anyone who you think would get along with me?

1339
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:54,709
I don't think you can handle her...

1340
00:57:54,710 --> 00:57:56,480
if she's too cool.

1341
00:57:58,221 --> 00:58:00,380
I'm not sure. You figure it out.

1342
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:06,090
Have you met other participants?

1343
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:09,130
I have. I met Cheol Hyeon and Jae Hyung.

1344
00:58:09,331 --> 00:58:10,860
Is that so?

1345
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:13,201
I was the one who chose your date.

1346
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:14,500
- You did? - Yes.

1347
00:58:14,501 --> 00:58:16,431
- You chose my date? - Yes.

1348
00:58:18,771 --> 00:58:20,670
I didn't want to do that either.

1349
00:58:21,641 --> 00:58:23,970
I tried my best to ask them questions.

1350
00:58:23,971 --> 00:58:26,110
- Who did you two between them? - Cheol Hyeon.

1351
00:58:26,241 --> 00:58:27,310
Why?

1352
00:58:27,311 --> 00:58:29,251
He seemed curious about you.

1353
00:58:29,451 --> 00:58:30,811
He seemed good at initiating a conversation.

1354
00:58:32,221 --> 00:58:34,350
I thought you needed someone like him...

1355
00:58:34,351 --> 00:58:35,951
at this moment.

1356
00:58:36,721 --> 00:58:38,890
And Jae Hyung didn't seem eager?

1357
00:58:38,891 --> 00:58:40,360
He didn't really ask questions?

1358
00:58:40,521 --> 00:58:42,560
I had a feeling that he was younger than you.

1359
00:58:42,561 --> 00:58:44,859
I've never seen you date a younger guy.

1360
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:47,630
- I felt like he was younger. Yes. - Did he seem younger?

1361
00:58:49,101 --> 00:58:51,741
I thought between the two, he would choose Cheol Hyeon.

1362
00:58:51,971 --> 00:58:55,810
Cheol Hyeon proactively leads conversations,

1363
00:58:55,811 --> 00:58:58,110
so he must've felt more comfortable talking to him.

1364
00:58:58,411 --> 00:59:00,280
He must've felt more relaxed with him.

1365
00:59:00,741 --> 00:59:02,880
That's why I thought he chose Cheol Hyeon.

1366
00:59:03,411 --> 00:59:05,479
Deep down,

1367
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:08,049
I kind of wished...

1368
00:59:08,050 --> 00:59:10,621
he had chosen Jae Hyung.

1369
00:59:11,190 --> 00:59:14,259
Cheol Hyeon looks really stylish with the bob haircut,

1370
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:15,260
doesn't he?

1371
00:59:15,261 --> 00:59:17,360
I asked if he thought of getting a haircut.

1372
00:59:18,431 --> 00:59:19,500
As far as I remember, you don't like guys...

1373
00:59:19,501 --> 00:59:20,860
- with long hair. - No, I don't.

1374
00:59:22,971 --> 00:59:24,701
He's really handsome, though.

1375
00:59:24,971 --> 00:59:27,471
He's so handsome. Both of them are good-looking.

1376
00:59:27,971 --> 00:59:30,411
I was confused, though.

1377
00:59:30,510 --> 00:59:31,570
Why?

1378
00:59:31,681 --> 00:59:33,779
I was aware when you had a boyfriend,

1379
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:36,181
but I've never asked you about him.

1380
00:59:36,751 --> 00:59:38,280
So I was confused.

1381
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:42,850
I remembered you had a boyfriend who acted cute,

1382
00:59:42,851 --> 00:59:45,491
but I wasn't sure if he was still your type.

1383
00:59:45,721 --> 00:59:47,920
I think I'll find out about that here too.

1384
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:51,130
I'm sure I like nice guys.

1385
00:59:51,590 --> 00:59:53,399
"Nice" can mean different things to different people.

1386
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:55,330
You'll realize it once you move it,

1387
00:59:55,331 --> 00:59:57,501
but all the participants seem so nice.

1388
00:59:58,271 --> 01:00:00,069
- I know one thing for sure. - What?

1389
01:00:00,070 --> 01:00:02,210
You don't look kind.

1390
01:00:03,241 --> 01:00:05,779
- You are... - Look how you look.

1391
01:00:05,780 --> 01:00:07,609
Well... Fine.

1392
01:00:07,610 --> 01:00:09,709
- Your smoky eye makeup. - We don't look kind.

1393
01:00:09,710 --> 01:00:13,251
The women are cheerful,

1394
01:00:13,721 --> 01:00:15,521
- and compared to them... - You're dark.

1395
01:00:15,951 --> 01:00:18,090
Yes. I wear dark colours too.

1396
01:00:18,291 --> 01:00:20,690
It was so hard.

1397
01:00:21,021 --> 01:00:22,089
- Why? - They said you were pretty,

1398
01:00:22,090 --> 01:00:23,831
but I couldn't stand hearing that.

1399
01:00:24,030 --> 01:00:25,959
You met two male participants, and they were handsome.

1400
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:28,431
- Yes. - Do you dare to move in?

1401
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:29,931
I want to escape.

1402
01:00:30,331 --> 01:00:33,601
When I met them, I thought, "Gosh, I'm done."

1403
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:36,170
Someone might like a guy like you.

1404
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:37,971
"Like you?"

1405
01:00:40,210 --> 01:00:41,241
It's funny.

1406
01:00:43,251 --> 01:00:44,609
I didn't expect to see finger-pointing...

1407
01:00:44,610 --> 01:00:46,451
in the Siblings' Room.

1408
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:49,549
- Goodness. - That was...

1409
01:00:49,550 --> 01:00:51,819
a very meaningful conversation.

1410
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:52,960
- Right. - Sure.

1411
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:55,290
Don't get the wrong idea. It was an enriching conversation.

1412
01:00:55,291 --> 01:00:57,830
They're giving each other more energy.

1413
01:00:57,831 --> 01:00:59,260
- More energy. - They didn't sugarcoat anything.

1414
01:00:59,501 --> 01:01:01,500
- They were just being honest. - Seriously.

1415
01:01:01,501 --> 01:01:04,330
That's how brothers and sisters normally have a conversation.

1416
01:01:04,331 --> 01:01:07,270
- That's normal. - You're right.

1417
01:01:07,271 --> 01:01:09,240
It looks like...

1418
01:01:09,241 --> 01:01:11,840
Ji Won is the pillar of the family.

1419
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:13,680
He calls her the oldest son.

1420
01:01:13,681 --> 01:01:15,509
She's younger, but she's acting...

1421
01:01:15,510 --> 01:01:17,410
- like the oldest child. - That might be true.

1422
01:01:17,411 --> 01:01:18,520
That's possible.

1423
01:01:18,521 --> 01:01:20,721
Yun Jae will go on a date too.

1424
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:21,790
Yes.

1425
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:23,220
I can't wait to see him change completely.

1426
01:01:23,221 --> 01:01:24,490
- I can't wait! - I want to see it.

1427
01:01:24,491 --> 01:01:26,819
- Right? - And I hope...

1428
01:01:26,820 --> 01:01:29,230
- Ji Won is there to watch it. - Right.

1429
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:39,300
(Cheol Hyeon)

1430
01:01:42,170 --> 01:01:43,971
(Ju Yeon)

1431
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:49,311
(Jung Sub)

1432
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:52,880
(Se Seung)

1433
01:01:56,021 --> 01:01:57,650
(Cho A)

1434
01:02:00,190 --> 01:02:02,161
(Yun Ha)

1435
01:02:05,201 --> 01:02:06,900
(Jae Hyung)

1436
01:02:10,070 --> 01:02:11,331
(Yong Woo)

1437
01:02:15,741 --> 01:02:17,070
(Ji Won)

1438
01:02:20,911 --> 01:02:25,010
(My Sibling's Romance)

1439
01:02:27,081 --> 01:02:31,721
(Episode 6: Beef Brisket is a Game Changer)

1440
01:02:33,161 --> 01:02:36,630
(They go on a 1-night, 2-day date in Gangwon Province today.)

1441
01:02:37,491 --> 01:02:40,400
(Ji Won's alarm is going off.)

1442
01:02:40,730 --> 01:02:41,800
Ji Won.

1443
01:02:43,871 --> 01:02:45,541
(Getting up)

1444
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:47,641
Did you sleep well?

1445
01:02:48,070 --> 01:02:50,271
I feel like I barely slept.

1446
01:02:50,971 --> 01:02:53,840
I was choosing someone...

1447
01:02:54,411 --> 01:02:56,680
in my dream.

1448
01:02:56,681 --> 01:03:00,420
I was choosing someone for a Random Date.

1449
01:03:00,851 --> 01:03:03,351
(She's still waking up.)

1450
01:03:04,190 --> 01:03:05,291
I should wash up.

1451
01:03:06,521 --> 01:03:07,689
(Ji Won is going to Gangwon Province with Cheol Hyeon...)

1452
01:03:07,690 --> 01:03:08,960
(after a music video shoot.)

1453
01:03:09,561 --> 01:03:11,460
(Ji Won is off to work.)

1454
01:03:14,661 --> 01:03:16,430
Cho A, what are you going to wear?

1455
01:03:16,431 --> 01:03:18,100
I'm not sure what to wear.

1456
01:03:18,101 --> 01:03:20,200
- The denim shirt. - You looked good in that.

1457
01:03:20,201 --> 01:03:22,541
- The denim shirt might be good. - Yes.

1458
01:03:25,070 --> 01:03:27,740
So I'll wear a denim shirt...

1459
01:03:27,741 --> 01:03:30,380
and a knitted shirt over it.

1460
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:32,681
- That would look pretty. - Okay.

1461
01:03:34,681 --> 01:03:36,750
But we'd look too similar.

1462
01:03:36,751 --> 01:03:38,621
I'd be too shy.

1463
01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:42,959
Let's just wear one matching item.

1464
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:43,990
Yes.

1465
01:03:43,991 --> 01:03:46,230
I'm hungry.

1466
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:49,570
(Washing strawberries)

1467
01:03:50,331 --> 01:03:53,069
The strawberries are too mushy.

1468
01:03:53,070 --> 01:03:54,770
I shouldn't have bought them.

1469
01:03:54,771 --> 01:03:57,710
It'd be nice if we just wear matching shirts.

1470
01:03:58,210 --> 01:03:59,280
This colour.

1471
01:03:59,980 --> 01:04:02,410
This goes well with the jeans.

1472
01:04:02,411 --> 01:04:04,649
I did wear this in the morning.

1473
01:04:04,650 --> 01:04:08,380
I miss you so much

1474
01:04:09,121 --> 01:04:11,090
(Going up with strawberries)

1475
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:17,791
- Don't go upstairs. - No.

1476
01:04:17,860 --> 01:04:18,860
Don't go up.

1477
01:04:18,861 --> 01:04:20,030
You don't have a padded jacket.

1478
01:04:20,661 --> 01:04:22,070
When is Cheol Hyeon coming?

1479
01:04:25,101 --> 01:04:26,200
Go up quickly!

1480
01:04:26,201 --> 01:04:28,170
- Run! - Don't go up.

1481
01:04:28,501 --> 01:04:30,271
- It was like that. - I see.

1482
01:04:32,041 --> 01:04:33,081
Oh, dear.

1483
01:04:38,210 --> 01:04:40,220
That's so many strawberries.

1484
01:04:40,221 --> 01:04:41,479
I washed some strawberries.

1485
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:43,250
They look beautiful.

1486
01:04:43,251 --> 01:04:44,920
- They... - They're delicious, but...

1487
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:55,431
(Sighing)

1488
01:04:59,141 --> 01:05:01,200
I could hear them talk outside.

1489
01:05:01,201 --> 01:05:03,570
If I try to chime in...

1490
01:05:04,811 --> 01:05:07,209
when he's talking to a woman alone,

1491
01:05:07,210 --> 01:05:09,549
it might rather backfire.

1492
01:05:09,550 --> 01:05:11,351
I might seem too bothered.

1493
01:05:11,610 --> 01:05:13,549
It's just the beginning as well.

1494
01:05:13,550 --> 01:05:17,150
I hope he talks to many people.

1495
01:05:17,420 --> 01:05:20,161
I don't know. I'm trying not to care.

1496
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:23,931
Please come out. Let's go.

1497
01:05:24,190 --> 01:05:27,300
Okay. Se Seung, you look really nice today.

1498
01:05:27,501 --> 01:05:28,830
I like drawing things.

1499
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:30,399
I'm sure...

1500
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:32,640
it's not as heavy as it looks. What do you think?

1501
01:05:32,641 --> 01:05:33,701
It's okay.

1502
01:05:34,141 --> 01:05:36,271
- Have fun. - Bye.

1503
01:05:42,210 --> 01:05:43,411
It's warm.

1504
01:05:43,550 --> 01:05:45,420
- It's warm. - It's nice.

1505
01:05:46,050 --> 01:05:48,221
We all talk slowly.

1506
01:05:49,621 --> 01:05:50,950
Is that so? You're right.

1507
01:05:50,951 --> 01:05:53,221
(The 3 slow speakers take off.)

1508
01:05:55,791 --> 01:05:57,960
We look like two chicks...

1509
01:05:58,561 --> 01:06:00,100
- and a chic teacher. - And a teacher.

1510
01:06:00,101 --> 01:06:01,229
(2 chicks and 1 chic teacher)

1511
01:06:01,230 --> 01:06:02,270
I'm a teacher.

1512
01:06:02,271 --> 01:06:03,530
Yun Ha, you can sit in the front.

1513
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:06,899
(The chic teacher sits in the back.)

1514
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:08,541
I'm excited.

1515
01:06:09,041 --> 01:06:11,141
- It will be fun. - I'm so excited.

1516
01:06:12,380 --> 01:06:13,410
We're taking off.

1517
01:06:13,411 --> 01:06:14,780
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1518
01:06:17,050 --> 01:06:18,951
Oh, my.

1519
01:06:19,650 --> 01:06:22,851
I thought it'd be more fun...

1520
01:06:22,951 --> 01:06:25,621
if the three of us hung out together.

1521
01:06:26,021 --> 01:06:28,319
I was happy not because the three of us were together,

1522
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:30,459
but because I was going with Jae Hyung.

1523
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:34,201
Because I wanted to spend more time with him.

1524
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:36,331
It was a shame it wasn't just the two of us,

1525
01:06:36,601 --> 01:06:39,470
but I thought I wouldn't be able to go with Jae Hyung anyway.

1526
01:06:39,471 --> 01:06:42,041
- Do you like makguksu? - And I got to go with him.

1527
01:06:42,570 --> 01:06:46,280
So I thought I'd enjoy it.

1528
01:06:46,510 --> 01:06:49,209
What kind of makguksu do you like? There are different kinds.

1529
01:06:49,210 --> 01:06:50,581
I like Chuncheon makguksu.

1530
01:06:51,150 --> 01:06:52,150
No.

1531
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:55,390
I was asking if you like the one with broth or with spicy sauce.

1532
01:06:55,391 --> 01:06:58,351
- I like the one with broth. - I like the one with spicy sauce.

1533
01:06:58,451 --> 01:07:00,161
I like the one with perilla oil.

1534
01:07:01,161 --> 01:07:02,161
I like it too.

1535
01:07:02,162 --> 01:07:04,860
- I'm serious. - I'm serious too.

1536
01:07:06,601 --> 01:07:09,971
I like to be the only guy in a group.

1537
01:07:10,070 --> 01:07:11,830
I really liked...

1538
01:07:11,831 --> 01:07:14,141
that I got to go with two women.

1539
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:17,641
I thought I'd be adored.

1540
01:07:18,741 --> 01:07:22,911
Because I could be the center of attention.

1541
01:07:24,451 --> 01:07:25,479
(The only guy in the group is excited.)

1542
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:27,681
Shall we go?

1543
01:07:27,721 --> 01:07:29,621
Shall we play an exciting song?

1544
01:07:29,851 --> 01:07:30,851
Yes.

1545
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:34,060
(She picked "I'm Yours" by Jason Mraz.)

1546
01:07:34,061 --> 01:07:35,859
I haven't listened to this song for a very long time.

1547
01:07:35,860 --> 01:07:38,030
Right? I played it as it's been a while for me too.

1548
01:07:39,931 --> 01:07:41,831
You're a good singer.

1549
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:44,431
You are just humming, but I can tell.

1550
01:07:44,771 --> 01:07:47,340
Can you teach me how to sing? I always wanted to learn.

1551
01:07:48,911 --> 01:07:50,070
I want to learn cello.

1552
01:07:50,141 --> 01:07:51,410
I'll teach you.

1553
01:07:51,411 --> 01:07:53,479
Does it have the same chords with the bass...

1554
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:54,541
when you play it with your right hand only?

1555
01:07:54,741 --> 01:07:56,350
No. The bass has different chords.

1556
01:07:56,351 --> 01:07:57,380
Does it?

1557
01:07:57,650 --> 01:07:59,251
As for cello, it's do, sol, re, la.

1558
01:07:59,351 --> 01:08:01,221
- Really? - Yes. What is it for the bass?

1559
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:02,320
Mi, la, re, sol.

1560
01:08:02,321 --> 01:08:03,851
Even I didn't know. How do you know that?

1561
01:08:04,091 --> 01:08:05,389
It's cool.

1562
01:08:05,390 --> 01:08:07,389
- You're talking about music. - Not the double bass.

1563
01:08:07,390 --> 01:08:08,420
- Oh, the bass guitar? - I...

1564
01:08:08,421 --> 01:08:09,460
- Yes. - The bass guitar.

1565
01:08:09,461 --> 01:08:11,261
But the open chords would be the same.

1566
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:13,559
I thought you were talking about the double bass.

1567
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:16,801
It's in the realm...

1568
01:08:16,970 --> 01:08:17,970
I can't even reach.

1569
01:08:17,971 --> 01:08:19,440
It seemed Jae Hyung and Yun Ha...

1570
01:08:19,541 --> 01:08:21,740
got very close at the beginning of the trip.

1571
01:08:21,741 --> 01:08:24,171
I could tell when I heard their conversation.

1572
01:08:24,541 --> 01:08:25,841
I thought they might have feelings for each other.

1573
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:30,411
"Something might be going on between them."

1574
01:08:30,780 --> 01:08:32,951
- Do you have absolute pitch then? - Yes.

1575
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:35,951
Which school did you go to? Korea National University of Arts?

1576
01:08:36,150 --> 01:08:37,150
How do you know?

1577
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:39,091
How did you guess it right at once?

1578
01:08:40,461 --> 01:08:42,331
It just felt like it.

1579
01:08:42,730 --> 01:08:44,630
The two are talking to each other only.

1580
01:08:44,631 --> 01:08:46,800
- She's excluded a little. - This is...

1581
01:08:46,801 --> 01:08:48,729
That's why you shouldn't sit in the back seat.

1582
01:08:48,730 --> 01:08:49,730
- Right. - I know.

1583
01:08:49,731 --> 01:08:51,730
Even if you're caught by the police, you should sit in the middle.

1584
01:08:52,140 --> 01:08:53,671
You're always excluded when you sit in the back seat.

1585
01:08:53,770 --> 01:08:55,470
- You should sit there? - You should sit like this.

1586
01:08:55,570 --> 01:08:56,939
You should sit like this, holding both sides.

1587
01:08:56,940 --> 01:08:57,940
I mean...

1588
01:08:57,941 --> 01:08:59,540
- You should talk like this. - It's dangerous.

1589
01:08:59,541 --> 01:09:01,780
Your legs would be like this then.

1590
01:09:02,110 --> 01:09:03,179
"Bass?"

1591
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:04,250
- "Music?" - You should sit here.

1592
01:09:04,251 --> 01:09:06,020
- The console. - "I like it too."

1593
01:09:06,650 --> 01:09:07,720
I like it.

1594
01:09:08,051 --> 01:09:09,991
You can't wear a seatbelt. You can't sit there. It's dangerous.

1595
01:09:10,091 --> 01:09:11,490
- Is it dangerous? - You'll be in trouble.

1596
01:09:11,491 --> 01:09:12,990
You don't have other choices if you want to win his love.

1597
01:09:12,991 --> 01:09:15,790
No. She should've sat in the front seat no matter what.

1598
01:09:15,791 --> 01:09:17,331
Why did she go to the back?

1599
01:09:17,591 --> 01:09:18,689
Have you played MapleStory?

1600
01:09:18,690 --> 01:09:20,360
- No. - I have.

1601
01:09:20,860 --> 01:09:22,270
- Have you not played it, Ju Yeon? - No.

1602
01:09:22,701 --> 01:09:23,870
I...

1603
01:09:23,871 --> 01:09:25,840
- You don't know what it is? - I didn't find it fun.

1604
01:09:25,841 --> 01:09:27,001
Which occupation did you have?

1605
01:09:28,241 --> 01:09:29,439
I don't even remember that.

1606
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:31,171
- I was a Magician. - Me too.

1607
01:09:32,140 --> 01:09:33,711
Aren't the Magicians the strongest?

1608
01:09:34,011 --> 01:09:35,210
They just look cool.

1609
01:09:35,211 --> 01:09:37,010
- Right. They're the cutest. - They have the coolest skills.

1610
01:09:37,011 --> 01:09:39,019
- Right. The skills are cool. - Yes.

1611
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:41,551
I watched them...

1612
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:45,091
having a friendly conversation, excluding me.

1613
01:09:45,991 --> 01:09:48,620
The others went out in groups of two.

1614
01:09:48,621 --> 01:09:50,131
We were the only group with three people.

1615
01:09:50,591 --> 01:09:53,730
And I joined them because no one picked me.

1616
01:09:54,831 --> 01:09:57,470
At first, I received a text. "No one..."

1617
01:09:57,900 --> 01:09:59,440
- "chose your sibling." - Okay.

1618
01:09:59,541 --> 01:10:01,970
Then I heard Yun Ha and Jae Hyung would go out together.

1619
01:10:02,470 --> 01:10:04,569
I guess they weren't chosen...

1620
01:10:04,570 --> 01:10:05,881
by the ones they picked.

1621
01:10:06,211 --> 01:10:10,011
So no one picked me.

1622
01:10:11,180 --> 01:10:12,951
So I joined them.

1623
01:10:14,251 --> 01:10:16,850
"Should I have not joined them?"

1624
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:26,630
Ju Yeon, does it feel comfortable in the back seat?

1625
01:10:26,631 --> 01:10:27,930
- It's very comfortable. - It's a big car.

1626
01:10:28,301 --> 01:10:29,729
- It might be uncomfortable there. - You're a great driver.

1627
01:10:29,730 --> 01:10:32,301
Really? I pressed the accelerator quite a lot.

1628
01:10:33,470 --> 01:10:36,911
It did seem she wasn't 100 percent okay.

1629
01:10:37,011 --> 01:10:39,140
I glanced at her through the rear view mirror.

1630
01:10:39,241 --> 01:10:43,051
It might've been not easy to hear the conversation in the front seat.

1631
01:10:43,881 --> 01:10:47,149
Why do you like Western music, Ju Yeon?

1632
01:10:47,150 --> 01:10:48,551
It seems you really like it.

1633
01:10:49,220 --> 01:10:51,650
Western music? I was influenced by my friends.

1634
01:10:52,190 --> 01:10:54,859
- My friend always sang them. - So I asked her this and that.

1635
01:10:54,860 --> 01:10:57,631
In a karaoke? I see.

1636
01:10:58,030 --> 01:10:59,560
- What do you want to eat? - To eat?

1637
01:10:59,930 --> 01:11:00,961
I'm hungry.

1638
01:11:03,070 --> 01:11:04,400
Cho A, did you eat something?

1639
01:11:04,501 --> 01:11:06,439
I only ate fruits.

1640
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:08,741
- How about gimbap? - It sounds amazing.

1641
01:11:09,070 --> 01:11:11,069
- Your outfit is cute. - You look fancy today.

1642
01:11:11,070 --> 01:11:12,140
- I do? - Yes.

1643
01:11:12,341 --> 01:11:13,881
Didn't I look fancy yesterday as well?

1644
01:11:14,980 --> 01:11:16,679
The sweater suited you yesterday.

1645
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:18,081
- It did? - Yes.

1646
01:11:19,081 --> 01:11:20,220
I should wear it again.

1647
01:11:20,650 --> 01:11:22,051
Do you like going to a café?

1648
01:11:22,150 --> 01:11:23,189
I like it.

1649
01:11:23,190 --> 01:11:26,220
Didn't you make coffee here at first?

1650
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:29,390
I like doing things in the kitchen.

1651
01:11:30,591 --> 01:11:33,660
It was the first time to have a date with Jung Sub.

1652
01:11:33,661 --> 01:11:36,599
It was a little awkward,

1653
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:39,841
but it made my heart flutter at the same time.

1654
01:11:40,171 --> 01:11:43,510
He left the strongest...

1655
01:11:43,511 --> 01:11:46,310
first impression on me.

1656
01:11:46,511 --> 01:11:50,551
When I saw Cho A at first, I was curious.

1657
01:11:50,850 --> 01:11:52,551
I want to know more about her.

1658
01:11:52,820 --> 01:11:56,390
I don't know how our date in Gangwon Province will go.

1659
01:11:57,421 --> 01:11:59,390
Will you be okay driving for an hour and a half?

1660
01:11:59,491 --> 01:12:01,960
Why don't you sit behind the wheel later?

1661
01:12:01,961 --> 01:12:03,131
- Behind the wheel? - Yes.

1662
01:12:03,530 --> 01:12:04,730
Will you be okay?

1663
01:12:06,100 --> 01:12:07,230
Why did you not get a driver's license?

1664
01:12:07,430 --> 01:12:09,100
People around me told me not to.

1665
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:12,371
Cheol Hyeon too.

1666
01:12:12,741 --> 01:12:14,139
- Cheol Hyeon? - Yes.

1667
01:12:14,140 --> 01:12:15,501
- Okay. - Cheol Hyeon...

1668
01:12:16,541 --> 01:12:19,309
- Wait. - What did she say?

1669
01:12:19,310 --> 01:12:20,609
- She made a mistake just now. - Oh, no.

1670
01:12:20,610 --> 01:12:21,910
- "Cheol Hyeon too." - You can't help it.

1671
01:12:21,911 --> 01:12:22,950
You can't help it.

1672
01:12:22,951 --> 01:12:24,080
- "Cheol Hyeon too." - It just comes out.

1673
01:12:24,081 --> 01:12:27,050
It's bound to happen when you get closer.

1674
01:12:27,051 --> 01:12:28,520
I don't know. She was caught already.

1675
01:12:29,291 --> 01:12:30,591
She must've been very flustered.

1676
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:34,461
Cheol Hyeon too.

1677
01:12:34,961 --> 01:12:36,229
- Cheol Hyeon? - Yes.

1678
01:12:36,230 --> 01:12:37,690
- Okay. - Cheol Hyeon...

1679
01:12:40,501 --> 01:12:43,701
Anyway, people around me stopped me.

1680
01:12:44,371 --> 01:12:46,100
(Laughing)

1681
01:12:47,041 --> 01:12:48,069
I heard Yong Woo...

1682
01:12:48,070 --> 01:12:50,510
- Right. He stopped me too. - had stopped you too.

1683
01:12:50,511 --> 01:12:53,080
Yes. Everyone around me...

1684
01:12:53,081 --> 01:12:54,881
told me not to do it.

1685
01:12:57,751 --> 01:12:59,251
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1686
01:13:04,150 --> 01:13:05,650
- Thank you. - Sure.

1687
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:13,261
- It seems... - Yes.

1688
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:15,399
You're thinking about your sibling a lot.

1689
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:16,430
- Me? - Yes.

1690
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:19,371
Why are you bringing it up again?

1691
01:13:19,970 --> 01:13:21,340
I forgot about it.

1692
01:13:21,341 --> 01:13:22,371
Oh, right.

1693
01:13:23,911 --> 01:13:25,069
Please keep it a secret.

1694
01:13:25,070 --> 01:13:26,510
I'll definitely keep it under wraps.

1695
01:13:26,511 --> 01:13:27,980
I'm excited somehow.

1696
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:30,480
Let's go.

1697
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:36,251
I wanted to go out with you.

1698
01:13:36,991 --> 01:13:38,091
I wanted to get to know you.

1699
01:13:38,791 --> 01:13:41,889
The smile you showed me when we bumped into each other...

1700
01:13:41,890 --> 01:13:44,290
looked very gentle.

1701
01:13:44,291 --> 01:13:47,530
It calmed me down.

1702
01:13:48,201 --> 01:13:49,469
- You received the card... - Yes.

1703
01:13:49,470 --> 01:13:50,529
About the date in Gangwon Province.

1704
01:13:50,530 --> 01:13:51,770
Did you expect it?

1705
01:13:53,541 --> 01:13:55,301
I did expect it a little.

1706
01:13:56,770 --> 01:13:58,070
- You did? - Yes.

1707
01:13:59,511 --> 01:14:01,110
Hold on. It's...

1708
01:14:01,310 --> 01:14:03,251
- Really? - Yes.

1709
01:14:03,350 --> 01:14:05,110
From who? Me?

1710
01:14:07,881 --> 01:14:08,881
It's a secret.

1711
01:14:11,051 --> 01:14:12,320
I can't say it.

1712
01:14:12,421 --> 01:14:14,961
(She became tight-lipped.)

1713
01:14:15,661 --> 01:14:20,201
If I say it, you'll know my feelings.

1714
01:14:20,661 --> 01:14:21,961
- Is that how it is? - Yes.

1715
01:14:25,270 --> 01:14:27,939
As Jonathan said, it's like watching Se Seung.

1716
01:14:27,940 --> 01:14:29,439
It's reversed, right?

1717
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:30,969
- You're right. - It comes not naturally.

1718
01:14:30,970 --> 01:14:32,041
Right.

1719
01:14:32,270 --> 01:14:36,810
If I say it, you'll know my feelings.

1720
01:14:37,350 --> 01:14:38,451
- Is that how it is? - Yes.

1721
01:14:44,091 --> 01:14:45,860
Why are you so innocent?

1722
01:14:46,390 --> 01:14:47,421
- I am? - Yes.

1723
01:14:48,060 --> 01:14:49,890
It reminds me of someone.

1724
01:14:50,831 --> 01:14:51,990
Why are you being like this?

1725
01:14:51,991 --> 01:14:54,530
Forget it. Right now.

1726
01:14:55,161 --> 01:14:57,870
I like your reaction...

1727
01:14:57,871 --> 01:14:59,671
when you're flustered.

1728
01:15:00,171 --> 01:15:02,639
I think everyone teases me...

1729
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:04,510
because they noticed it.

1730
01:15:04,511 --> 01:15:06,210
Is there someone else who teased you like this?

1731
01:15:06,211 --> 01:15:07,940
No. I was talking about you.

1732
01:15:11,751 --> 01:15:13,720
"Gapyeong Service Area." I haven't been here for a long time.

1733
01:15:14,780 --> 01:15:15,950
I'm so excited.

1734
01:15:15,951 --> 01:15:18,149
(Gapyeong Service Area)

1735
01:15:18,150 --> 01:15:19,890
- I can't believe how excited I am. - For real.

1736
01:15:20,020 --> 01:15:22,261
- Here it is. - Thank you.

1737
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:23,430
Have a nice day.

1738
01:15:23,791 --> 01:15:25,389
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1739
01:15:25,390 --> 01:15:26,600
His English is good.

1740
01:15:27,230 --> 01:15:28,960
Thank you for the gift, Jung Sub.

1741
01:15:28,961 --> 01:15:30,569
- I thank you. - You didn't have to do it.

1742
01:15:30,570 --> 01:15:31,900
- Oh, my. - Oh, my.

1743
01:15:32,001 --> 01:15:33,439
- Oh, my gosh. - You're so thoughtful.

1744
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:34,440
Here.

1745
01:15:34,841 --> 01:15:38,411
It feels like I'm travelling as I'm eating a walnut pastry.

1746
01:15:48,180 --> 01:15:49,820
- Oh, my goodness. - So this is how it looks.

1747
01:15:50,421 --> 01:15:51,719
The colour is pretty.

1748
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:52,889
- It's pretty? - Yes.

1749
01:15:52,890 --> 01:15:53,890
It is?

1750
01:15:53,961 --> 01:15:55,820
- Hello. - Hello.

1751
01:15:56,230 --> 01:15:57,930
We're pretty much beginners.

1752
01:15:58,360 --> 01:16:00,331
(Warming up before exercising)

1753
01:16:04,070 --> 01:16:05,569
- It suits you. - This colour?

1754
01:16:05,570 --> 01:16:06,600
Yes. The colour.

1755
01:16:09,770 --> 01:16:12,070
Your postures are crazy.

1756
01:16:12,911 --> 01:16:14,810
(A special training session for Cho A)

1757
01:16:15,980 --> 01:16:17,051
(Hitting)

1758
01:16:17,180 --> 01:16:18,809
I'm destroying everything.

1759
01:16:18,810 --> 01:16:19,921
Are you destroying it?

1760
01:16:22,921 --> 01:16:24,350
I'll try sending the ball to you.

1761
01:16:24,421 --> 01:16:25,850
- You should throw it gently. - Gently.

1762
01:16:26,060 --> 01:16:27,621
- I think I'll be good at it. - Yes.

1763
01:16:31,131 --> 01:16:33,060
Again. My gosh.

1764
01:16:33,961 --> 01:16:35,161
(Laughing)

1765
01:16:38,871 --> 01:16:40,370
- Again. - This is a good exercise.

1766
01:16:40,371 --> 01:16:41,371
I know.

1767
01:16:46,610 --> 01:16:47,679
I think you're good.

1768
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:48,710
- You do? - Yes.

1769
01:16:48,711 --> 01:16:49,950
I think it's relieving my stress.

1770
01:16:49,951 --> 01:16:51,011
Yes.

1771
01:16:58,791 --> 01:17:00,389
I can hit the ball over the net now.

1772
01:17:00,390 --> 01:17:01,461
- I know. - Yes.

1773
01:17:03,261 --> 01:17:04,331
Nice.

1774
01:17:06,161 --> 01:17:07,860
- It's... - You're so good.

1775
01:17:13,900 --> 01:17:15,140
You're really good.

1776
01:17:15,871 --> 01:17:17,969
- Drink this. - Thank you.

1777
01:17:17,970 --> 01:17:18,970
Okay.

1778
01:17:19,841 --> 01:17:20,911
You're good.

1779
01:17:21,780 --> 01:17:23,510
You're quite athletic, right?

1780
01:17:23,511 --> 01:17:25,849
I'm not that athletic.

1781
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:28,980
- You're not? - Why don't we speak casually?

1782
01:17:29,081 --> 01:17:30,091
Well...

1783
01:17:30,690 --> 01:17:32,350
Should we not? Should we speak formally?

1784
01:17:32,451 --> 01:17:33,559
That's nice too.

1785
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:34,690
- I'm fine with it. - It suits us.

1786
01:17:34,791 --> 01:17:36,390
- I'm fine with it. - You are?

1787
01:17:37,890 --> 01:17:39,330
It reminds me of someone.

1788
01:17:39,331 --> 01:17:40,700
The one who speaks with ambiguous honorifics?

1789
01:17:40,701 --> 01:17:41,831
The ambiguous honorifics.

1790
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:45,630
As I played tennis with Jung Sub,

1791
01:17:45,631 --> 01:17:47,069
it became a little comfortable.

1792
01:17:47,070 --> 01:17:50,871
We agreed to speak casually.

1793
01:17:50,970 --> 01:17:53,639
When I played tennis with him...

1794
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:55,179
and when I observed him before,

1795
01:17:55,180 --> 01:17:58,679
I felt he was very considerate about others...

1796
01:17:58,680 --> 01:18:00,121
when speaking or acting.

1797
01:18:00,220 --> 01:18:02,121
I'll throw it nice and easy again.

1798
01:18:04,951 --> 01:18:07,921
I've never played tennis before.

1799
01:18:08,020 --> 01:18:10,530
So I was a little afraid and excited.

1800
01:18:10,761 --> 01:18:13,930
When I was in that kind of situation,

1801
01:18:14,030 --> 01:18:18,201
I felt that he made me feel comfortable.

1802
01:18:19,301 --> 01:18:20,570
- Let's do that. - Okay.

1803
01:18:20,671 --> 01:18:22,041
Let's be friends and speak casually now.

1804
01:18:23,341 --> 01:18:24,609
(Se Seung and Yong Woo's date in Gangwon Province)

1805
01:18:24,610 --> 01:18:25,671
Is it that one?

1806
01:18:26,341 --> 01:18:27,341
I think that's the ship.

1807
01:18:27,342 --> 01:18:29,750
I got suddenly excited, looking at it.

1808
01:18:29,751 --> 01:18:30,751
(A dock on Nami Island)

1809
01:18:30,752 --> 01:18:32,751
- It clears your mind, right? - Yes.

1810
01:18:36,220 --> 01:18:37,551
We're going.

1811
01:18:38,150 --> 01:18:40,591
- Oh, gosh. - It's so nice.

1812
01:18:41,961 --> 01:18:44,331
- Isn't it cold? - It's so cold.

1813
01:18:44,491 --> 01:18:45,491
- Right? - Yes.

1814
01:18:45,492 --> 01:18:47,360
- Do you want to go inside? - I'm fine.

1815
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:49,730
- Do you want to wear this? - No, I'm fine.

1816
01:18:50,070 --> 01:18:51,130
- I'm really fine. - Are you sure?

1817
01:18:51,131 --> 01:18:52,671
I'll tell you when I feel like I'm dying.

1818
01:18:53,770 --> 01:18:54,770
Okay.

1819
01:18:56,211 --> 01:18:57,341
The view is amazing.

1820
01:18:57,671 --> 01:18:58,671
The sunset.

1821
01:18:58,672 --> 01:18:59,881
(Exclaiming)

1822
01:19:00,610 --> 01:19:02,980
- I can see the sun right there. - Yes.

1823
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:04,280
We'll be able to see it more.

1824
01:19:05,650 --> 01:19:08,679
It was amazing. I think one of the best moments...

1825
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:10,621
on Nami Island was when we went by ship.

1826
01:19:10,991 --> 01:19:12,921
- It's so pretty. - I know, right?

1827
01:19:16,390 --> 01:19:17,960
It didn't take long.

1828
01:19:17,961 --> 01:19:18,961
(They got to Nami Island quickly.)

1829
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:23,631
"Welcome."

1830
01:19:24,270 --> 01:19:26,440
I think I've never been here.

1831
01:19:26,541 --> 01:19:28,640
- In your life? - I've never been here in my life.

1832
01:19:28,940 --> 01:19:30,411
- It's like an amusement park. - Yes.

1833
01:19:33,140 --> 01:19:35,080
I saw the photos and the videos, but I've never seen it in person.

1834
01:19:35,081 --> 01:19:36,250
This place is so pretty.

1835
01:19:36,251 --> 01:19:37,850
Yes. It's very pretty.

1836
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:40,920
Do you want to take pictures?

1837
01:19:40,921 --> 01:19:41,921
It sounds good.

1838
01:19:41,922 --> 01:19:44,219
- Poop? - Poop? Is there poop?

1839
01:19:44,220 --> 01:19:45,991
It's a poop shape.

1840
01:19:47,161 --> 01:19:48,890
Is it customized for you?

1841
01:19:49,421 --> 01:19:52,030
- How does it fit so perfectly? - This is made just for me.

1842
01:19:55,331 --> 01:19:57,331
(A poop duo)

1843
01:20:05,741 --> 01:20:07,511
We should make sure the poop is in the frame.

1844
01:20:08,180 --> 01:20:09,480
Let's put our poop together.

1845
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:13,020
(Putting their poop together)

1846
01:20:14,951 --> 01:20:18,551
(Celebrating Yong Woo and Se Seung's first date)

1847
01:20:19,020 --> 01:20:20,420
- They're selling steamed buns. - Steamed buns.

1848
01:20:20,421 --> 01:20:21,421
- What? - What?

1849
01:20:21,820 --> 01:20:24,631
Steamed buns? I can't resist it.

1850
01:20:25,230 --> 01:20:26,300
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1851
01:20:26,301 --> 01:20:27,801
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1852
01:20:29,261 --> 01:20:30,301
It's hot.

1853
01:20:32,570 --> 01:20:34,201
Do you like steamed buns?

1854
01:20:34,570 --> 01:20:35,640
I love them.

1855
01:20:38,070 --> 01:20:40,711
(Meanwhile, a man who has never appeared is in front of the house.)

1856
01:20:42,081 --> 01:20:43,911
- Who is it? - He has come.

1857
01:20:44,011 --> 01:20:45,050
- Who is it? - Why are you asking?

1858
01:20:45,051 --> 01:20:46,051
It's Yun Jae.

1859
01:20:47,421 --> 01:20:50,121
(He enters without hesitation.)

1860
01:20:52,991 --> 01:20:54,060
- It's Jae Hyung. - Jae Hyung?

1861
01:20:54,690 --> 01:20:56,230
(Cheol Hyeon got his hair cut.)

1862
01:20:56,890 --> 01:20:59,801
- It's Cheol Hyeon? - It's Cheol Hyeon!

1863
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:02,059
- Oh, my gosh. - It's unbelievable.

1864
01:21:02,060 --> 01:21:04,599
- I knew it. - I was wondering who it was.

1865
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:05,830
- I told you. - I knew it.

1866
01:21:05,831 --> 01:21:06,840
He'd look amazing...

1867
01:21:06,841 --> 01:21:08,040
- in a different style. - He entered the house like that.

1868
01:21:08,041 --> 01:21:09,370
- He got his hair cut. - He looks so cool.

1869
01:21:09,371 --> 01:21:11,170
- I wondered who it was. - My gosh.

1870
01:21:11,171 --> 01:21:12,979
He knew he would look amazing if he changed his style.

1871
01:21:12,980 --> 01:21:14,211
- Sit down for now. - Yes.

1872
01:21:14,381 --> 01:21:15,381
He could just change his style...

1873
01:21:15,382 --> 01:21:17,250
- when he wants to look better. - I know.

1874
01:21:17,251 --> 01:21:18,649
- He can just change his style. - He can just change it.

1875
01:21:18,650 --> 01:21:19,951
- What is this? - My goodness.

1876
01:21:20,051 --> 01:21:21,750
- How did he get his hair cut... - I want to have a closer look.

1877
01:21:21,751 --> 01:21:22,751
- right away? - What's going on?

1878
01:21:22,752 --> 01:21:24,019
It's not easy to get your hair cut after growing a lot.

1879
01:21:24,020 --> 01:21:25,091
That's very brave of him.

1880
01:21:25,850 --> 01:21:28,161
(Touching)

1881
01:21:32,430 --> 01:21:35,161
(He squeezes hair cream on his hand.)

1882
01:21:35,661 --> 01:21:37,100
(Rubbing)

1883
01:21:37,831 --> 01:21:40,440
(He feels awkward in the new hairstyle.)

1884
01:21:40,741 --> 01:21:44,911
In the Secret Room, Ji Won's sibling...

1885
01:21:45,411 --> 01:21:48,341
asked me if I could get my hair cut.

1886
01:21:48,881 --> 01:21:50,810
(Yesterday in the Secret Room)

1887
01:21:51,211 --> 01:21:55,120
(Can you get your hair cut by any chance?)

1888
01:21:55,121 --> 01:21:58,051
(Yes. I wanted to get it cut immediately.)

1889
01:21:58,850 --> 01:22:01,189
(Does my hair look that bad?)

1890
01:22:01,190 --> 01:22:03,661
(It suits you. I'm just asking.)

1891
01:22:03,991 --> 01:22:05,859
"Does my hair look messy?"

1892
01:22:05,860 --> 01:22:08,000
I thought I should show my new charm...

1893
01:22:08,001 --> 01:22:11,100
before going out on a date today.

1894
01:22:11,371 --> 01:22:14,470
The new chapter of Cheol Hyeon might be opening.

1895
01:22:16,810 --> 01:22:18,940
That's why I got my hair cut.

1896
01:22:19,211 --> 01:22:22,211
(He opened the new chapter with ambition.)

1897
01:22:25,810 --> 01:22:28,121
(Touching)

1898
01:22:28,921 --> 01:22:30,621
(Touching)

1899
01:22:33,261 --> 01:22:35,820
(The more he touches his hair, the weirder it becomes.)

1900
01:22:39,631 --> 01:22:41,301
All his hair would fall out.

1901
01:22:43,070 --> 01:22:44,831
What's the difference?

1902
01:22:44,930 --> 01:22:46,170
- Stop. - His hair would fall out.

1903
01:22:46,171 --> 01:22:48,201
I understand him.

1904
01:22:48,301 --> 01:22:49,599
What's this? What's the difference?

1905
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:50,939
I know what it is.

1906
01:22:50,940 --> 01:22:52,639
- Is there a difference? - You keep touching your hair...

1907
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:54,080
because it still feels awkward.

1908
01:22:54,081 --> 01:22:55,081
You should wash your hair at a moment like this.

1909
01:22:55,082 --> 01:22:57,180
The more you touch your hair, the weirder it looks.

1910
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:59,250
- You know it, right? - Yes. You should shake your head.

1911
01:22:59,251 --> 01:23:01,080
In the end, you wear a cap.

1912
01:23:01,081 --> 01:23:02,451
That's so true.

1913
01:23:03,320 --> 01:23:04,750
You wear a cap after getting your hair cut.

1914
01:23:04,751 --> 01:23:06,050
You wear a cap after putting wax on your hair.

1915
01:23:06,051 --> 01:23:07,720
- Right. - Oh, no.

1916
01:23:12,530 --> 01:23:15,331
(His hair is curled.)

1917
01:23:15,801 --> 01:23:18,930
(He's going to the place where he's supposed to meet Ji Won.)

1918
01:23:19,230 --> 01:23:22,201
In my opinion, Ji Won's facial expression doesn't change much.

1919
01:23:22,301 --> 01:23:25,110
She's always calm,

1920
01:23:25,270 --> 01:23:27,939
and it got me curious.

1921
01:23:27,940 --> 01:23:31,310
She looks calm, but I feel like there's something inside.

1922
01:23:31,680 --> 01:23:35,020
I've been curious ever since I felt that.

1923
01:23:35,621 --> 01:23:38,591
(Where did he go with the curiosity about Ji Won?)

1924
01:23:43,690 --> 01:23:46,430
(Ji Won and Cheol Hyeon in a café in Jeongneung)

1925
01:23:47,001 --> 01:23:49,661
(It keeps bothering him.)

1926
01:23:53,940 --> 01:23:57,570
(The new chapter isn't going smoothly.)

1927
01:24:02,511 --> 01:24:07,320
The shooting ended almost at 8pm.

1928
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:10,889
I went to a nearby café after it's over.

1929
01:24:10,890 --> 01:24:12,690
Cheol Hyeon was waiting there.

1930
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:15,520
What?

1931
01:24:15,521 --> 01:24:17,761
- You got your hair cut. - Hello.

1932
01:24:17,860 --> 01:24:19,190
Hello.

1933
01:24:19,461 --> 01:24:20,859
I'm sorry. You've been waiting for a long time, right?

1934
01:24:20,860 --> 01:24:21,860
No.

1935
01:24:21,861 --> 01:24:23,970
The shooting ended late.

1936
01:24:24,730 --> 01:24:25,770
- Don't worry. - What do you think of my hair?

1937
01:24:26,100 --> 01:24:27,100
It suits you.

1938
01:24:27,101 --> 01:24:28,139
- Is it okay? - Yes.

1939
01:24:28,140 --> 01:24:29,140
It's a relief.

1940
01:24:29,541 --> 01:24:31,140
I had ruined my hair before I came earlier.

1941
01:24:31,470 --> 01:24:32,911
Why? Why was it ruined?

1942
01:24:33,310 --> 01:24:34,341
It became oily.

1943
01:24:35,110 --> 01:24:37,951
Oily? Did they apply a lot of products?

1944
01:24:38,150 --> 01:24:39,551
My hair became flat.

1945
01:24:39,650 --> 01:24:41,951
No. Your hair looks fine. It's pretty.

1946
01:24:42,650 --> 01:24:46,190
(What did you think of his hairstyle?)

1947
01:24:46,491 --> 01:24:47,560
His hair...

1948
01:24:51,230 --> 01:24:54,030
Doesn't he look like a chick?

1949
01:24:54,360 --> 01:24:56,001
His hair was curled like this. "What's that?"

1950
01:24:56,201 --> 01:24:59,100
"The hairdresser styled his hair like that?"

1951
01:24:59,671 --> 01:25:02,769
He would've looked cool if it had been done right.

1952
01:25:02,770 --> 01:25:04,741
But his hair was curled like this,

1953
01:25:05,671 --> 01:25:07,810
so he looked like a chick.

1954
01:25:08,211 --> 01:25:10,911
He kept asking if his hair looked okay.

1955
01:25:12,211 --> 01:25:14,280
Because of my profession,

1956
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:18,190
I thought it'd look nice if it was styled again.

1957
01:25:18,350 --> 01:25:19,690
I wanted to style his hair.

1958
01:25:21,091 --> 01:25:22,189
- No. - It's hilarious.

1959
01:25:22,190 --> 01:25:23,390
(Groaning)

1960
01:25:23,461 --> 01:25:25,689
It's not easy for men to style their own hair.

1961
01:25:25,690 --> 01:25:27,761
- Right. - Oh, no.

1962
01:25:27,860 --> 01:25:29,660
- Style his hair, please. - She should style his hair.

1963
01:25:29,661 --> 01:25:30,671
Please.

1964
01:25:31,230 --> 01:25:33,099
I was so surprised yesterday.

1965
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:35,171
- Why? - Our birthdays are the same.

1966
01:25:35,270 --> 01:25:36,711
Our birthdays? Right.

1967
01:25:36,871 --> 01:25:38,269
- How can they be the same? - How can it happen?

1968
01:25:38,270 --> 01:25:39,980
I know. July 1.

1969
01:25:40,610 --> 01:25:41,841
It's unbelievable.

1970
01:25:42,911 --> 01:25:43,980
It's so fascinating.

1971
01:25:44,411 --> 01:25:45,609
Do you know anyone else who shares the same birthday?

1972
01:25:45,610 --> 01:25:46,680
No. There's no one.

1973
01:25:46,780 --> 01:25:47,850
It's the first time for me too.

1974
01:25:48,051 --> 01:25:49,720
July 1? No one shared the same birthday as me.

1975
01:25:49,921 --> 01:25:52,751
For real. It's so interesting.

1976
01:25:53,991 --> 01:25:57,190
I have an ideal brother-in-law in mind.

1977
01:25:57,291 --> 01:25:59,261
And there are several qualifications for that.

1978
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:01,899
One of them is a birthday.

1979
01:26:01,900 --> 01:26:07,070
"If we share the same birthday, we will never forget."

1980
01:26:07,301 --> 01:26:10,569
"We won't argue because one of us forget our birthday."

1981
01:26:10,570 --> 01:26:13,911
"We'll be equally happy on that day."

1982
01:26:14,581 --> 01:26:16,779
It'd be amazing if we were born in the same year as well.

1983
01:26:16,780 --> 01:26:18,080
- But I don't think... - That's...

1984
01:26:18,081 --> 01:26:19,149
- it'd be the case. - Right?

1985
01:26:19,150 --> 01:26:20,150
Yes.

1986
01:26:20,551 --> 01:26:22,680
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1987
01:26:25,220 --> 01:26:26,890
Do you think the shooting went well today?

1988
01:26:26,991 --> 01:26:29,791
Today? Yes. I had so much fun.

1989
01:26:30,161 --> 01:26:33,161
Since when did we speak casually?

1990
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:35,100
- Should we speak casually? - Why are we speaking casually?

1991
01:26:35,701 --> 01:26:37,099
I go back and forth.

1992
01:26:37,100 --> 01:26:38,370
I'm the only one...

1993
01:26:38,371 --> 01:26:40,201
who speaks half formally and half casually here.

1994
01:26:40,301 --> 01:26:44,070
I'm speaking casually because you are.

1995
01:26:44,171 --> 01:26:45,711
I think it's more comfortable when I speak casually.

1996
01:26:46,070 --> 01:26:47,880
- Should we drop the honorifics? - Yes. It sounds good.

1997
01:26:47,881 --> 01:26:49,741
- Okay. - I'm more comfortable in that way.

1998
01:26:49,980 --> 01:26:52,451
When I call you Ms. Ji Won, it sounds so formal.

1999
01:26:52,680 --> 01:26:53,951
- It sounds so polite. - "Ms. Ji Won."

2000
01:26:55,350 --> 01:26:56,350
You're right.

2001
01:26:58,751 --> 01:27:00,961
- The sun is setting. - Yes.

2002
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:03,219
It's pretty.

2003
01:27:03,220 --> 01:27:04,761
(Yun Ha, Jae Hyung, and Ju Yeon in the cable car over the lake)

2004
01:27:05,631 --> 01:27:07,661
(Dancing)

2005
01:27:08,331 --> 01:27:09,501
Let's do it together.

2006
01:27:09,860 --> 01:27:11,201
Let's do it together.

2007
01:27:13,270 --> 01:27:14,939
Should we get a cute hair clip each?

2008
01:27:14,940 --> 01:27:15,940
Let's do that.

2009
01:27:15,941 --> 01:27:17,841
- Let me pay for it. - Really?

2010
01:27:18,970 --> 01:27:19,980
You're so cool.

2011
01:27:21,541 --> 01:27:22,639
Shall I put it in a paper bag for you?

2012
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:25,350
No, it's fine. We're going to put it in our hair now.

2013
01:27:25,881 --> 01:27:27,121
- Right now? - Yes.

2014
01:27:27,621 --> 01:27:28,680
Thank you.

2015
01:27:29,850 --> 01:27:32,150
- How is it? - It's cute.

2016
01:27:32,820 --> 01:27:33,890
Where should I put it?

2017
01:27:34,791 --> 01:27:36,290
- Let me do it for you. - Let's pick the cutest spot...

2018
01:27:36,291 --> 01:27:37,390
for him.

2019
01:27:37,831 --> 01:27:40,060
He got along with it.

2020
01:27:41,331 --> 01:27:42,331
He really enjoyed it.

2021
01:27:42,430 --> 01:27:43,831
No. Let's move it a little.

2022
01:27:46,171 --> 01:27:47,270
"What kind of person is he?"

2023
01:27:48,801 --> 01:27:50,170
"What is it?"

2024
01:27:50,171 --> 01:27:52,770
I liked that side of him as well. I found it cute.

2025
01:28:00,081 --> 01:28:01,650
(Dropping)

2026
01:28:04,091 --> 01:28:07,961
A male high school student was looking at Jae Hyung...

2027
01:28:08,060 --> 01:28:10,161
when he dropped his phone.

2028
01:28:11,890 --> 01:28:12,929
I guess he was surprised.

2029
01:28:12,930 --> 01:28:15,729
Yes. He fell in love because of your beauty.

2030
01:28:15,730 --> 01:28:18,270
- Did he? - Did you not feel it?

2031
01:28:18,671 --> 01:28:19,900
That might be the case.

2032
01:28:20,671 --> 01:28:21,970
(Laughing)

2033
01:28:22,671 --> 01:28:23,871
When we were sitting,

2034
01:28:23,970 --> 01:28:27,109
a middle-aged woman who was passing by...

2035
01:28:27,110 --> 01:28:28,110
He's a guy, right?

2036
01:28:28,110 --> 01:28:29,110
- Yes. - She's a woman.

2037
01:28:30,610 --> 01:28:33,010
No. That's a guy.

2038
01:28:33,011 --> 01:28:34,019
That's a man.

2039
01:28:34,020 --> 01:28:36,480
But you look so pretty. The hair clip suits you.

2040
01:28:37,220 --> 01:28:38,491
Oh, my gosh.

2041
01:28:39,650 --> 01:28:43,390
When they were passing by, they said, "You look pretty."

2042
01:28:43,491 --> 01:28:45,230
I liked it as it felt like they found me adorable.

2043
01:28:47,001 --> 01:28:48,860
I'm like an attention seeker.

2044
01:28:49,430 --> 01:28:50,870
But they paid attention in a good way.

2045
01:28:50,871 --> 01:28:52,330
I was just sitting there...

2046
01:28:52,331 --> 01:28:55,639
with a hair clip in my hair and my legs crossed.

2047
01:28:55,640 --> 01:28:57,540
I don't have to try so hard...

2048
01:28:57,541 --> 01:28:59,871
to look pretty.

2049
01:29:02,341 --> 01:29:03,951
- Hello. - Hello.

2050
01:29:04,780 --> 01:29:06,109
- Gosh. - Get on slowly.

2051
01:29:06,110 --> 01:29:08,050
- I'm scared. - Get on slowly.

2052
01:29:08,051 --> 01:29:09,780
- Get on slowly. - Gosh.

2053
01:29:10,291 --> 01:29:12,890
It's still fun, for now.

2054
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:14,560
(Laughing)

2055
01:29:14,561 --> 01:29:15,860
- This is... - Hey, this is...

2056
01:29:15,961 --> 01:29:17,591
about 50cm.

2057
01:29:19,631 --> 01:29:21,600
She's really scared. Oh, no.

2058
01:29:22,900 --> 01:29:24,801
- Gosh, don't be nervous. - Gosh.

2059
01:29:27,371 --> 01:29:28,501
It's scary.

2060
01:29:28,970 --> 01:29:30,140
- Gosh. - No.

2061
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:32,511
Amazing.

2062
01:29:33,680 --> 01:29:35,211
It's not as scary as I thought it would be.

2063
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:36,511
Amazing.

2064
01:29:37,780 --> 01:29:38,911
Gosh, it's beautiful.

2065
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:41,280
This is fun.

2066
01:29:42,051 --> 01:29:43,081
This is fun.

2067
01:29:44,591 --> 01:29:47,921
There's slightly a sunset. It's a bit red right now.

2068
01:29:49,291 --> 01:29:51,131
This is so romantic.

2069
01:29:51,890 --> 01:29:53,430
It's shaking. Wait.

2070
01:29:53,930 --> 01:29:56,831
(Inside a shaky cable car)

2071
01:29:57,470 --> 01:30:00,841
(Yun Ha was shaking)

2072
01:30:01,701 --> 01:30:04,741
(The cable car won't fall)

2073
01:30:05,671 --> 01:30:07,140
- It's pretty. - Gosh.

2074
01:30:08,241 --> 01:30:10,451
- Amazing. - It's pretty.

2075
01:30:11,011 --> 01:30:12,780
- It's nice. - It's really nice.

2076
01:30:13,081 --> 01:30:14,150
Go on.

2077
01:30:15,251 --> 01:30:16,921
- Okay. - A little more to the left.

2078
01:30:27,060 --> 01:30:28,131
That's a nice picture.

2079
01:30:31,730 --> 01:30:32,770
I'm cold.

2080
01:30:33,270 --> 01:30:35,900
Stick together.

2081
01:30:36,810 --> 01:30:38,809
But since we're all gathered together,

2082
01:30:38,810 --> 01:30:40,040
It's warm.

2083
01:30:40,041 --> 01:30:41,081
It's less cold.

2084
01:30:42,310 --> 01:30:44,780
Jae Hyung kept telling us to stick together,

2085
01:30:46,011 --> 01:30:47,081
so we were all stuck together.

2086
01:30:48,751 --> 01:30:50,451
I tried my best to stick close to him.

2087
01:30:51,551 --> 01:30:53,150
Jae Hyung is very chic,

2088
01:30:53,421 --> 01:30:55,019
so I didn't think he'd like that.

2089
01:30:55,020 --> 01:30:57,860
But it turned out he liked it when everyone was close together.

2090
01:30:58,230 --> 01:31:00,400
I think I got to see another side of him.

2091
01:31:01,060 --> 01:31:02,529
Once you're used to it,

2092
01:31:02,530 --> 01:31:03,831
it's all... It's not... It's all right...

2093
01:31:04,900 --> 01:31:05,930
I'm cold!

2094
01:31:06,270 --> 01:31:07,599
What? What did you say?

2095
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:08,671
I'm cold!

2096
01:31:09,640 --> 01:31:12,041
(They stopped by a coffee shop to take cover from the cold.)

2097
01:31:13,110 --> 01:31:16,109
(Humming)

2098
01:31:16,110 --> 01:31:17,551
You're good at vibrato.

2099
01:31:18,310 --> 01:31:19,810
Isn't this how you play the cello?

2100
01:31:20,881 --> 01:31:22,780
Put your hand like this.

2101
01:31:23,421 --> 01:31:24,921
And then you go like this.

2102
01:31:25,390 --> 01:31:26,451
I see.

2103
01:31:26,860 --> 01:31:28,060
- Yes, that's it. - I see.

2104
01:31:29,761 --> 01:31:30,831
You're good at it.

2105
01:31:34,201 --> 01:31:36,899
Jae Hyung's not like that with me,

2106
01:31:36,900 --> 01:31:38,599
but to Yun Ha,

2107
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:42,070
he's very friendly and jokes around.

2108
01:31:43,940 --> 01:31:44,969
"I should change his mind."

2109
01:31:44,970 --> 01:31:46,770
"I should express my feelings more."

2110
01:31:47,110 --> 01:31:48,410
Since it seemed like he was not aware of it,

2111
01:31:48,411 --> 01:31:50,011
I thought I should express my feelings a lot.

2112
01:31:50,951 --> 01:31:53,149
Yun Ha went to the bathroom,

2113
01:31:53,150 --> 01:31:54,150
and we talked about...

2114
01:31:54,151 --> 01:31:56,020
whether we thought each other as older or younger.

2115
01:31:56,921 --> 01:31:59,120
- I want all of us... - Yes.

2116
01:31:59,121 --> 01:32:00,421
To know each other's age.

2117
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:02,660
- Don't you agree? - Why?

2118
01:32:02,661 --> 01:32:05,029
- We've gotten close to each other, - Yes.

2119
01:32:05,030 --> 01:32:06,461
But we're still referring to each other formally.

2120
01:32:07,161 --> 01:32:10,100
Older, younger. Younger, older. Older, younger...

2121
01:32:10,701 --> 01:32:12,371
- What do you think? - I think I'm older.

2122
01:32:12,501 --> 01:32:15,500
- Really? Seriously? - Seriously.

2123
01:32:15,501 --> 01:32:18,440
Really? I thought I was definitely older.

2124
01:32:19,110 --> 01:32:20,711
Do you prefer older or younger women?

2125
01:32:21,341 --> 01:32:22,711
I've only been with women younger than me.

2126
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:24,911
I hadn't even been with someone who was the same age as me.

2127
01:32:27,081 --> 01:32:28,719
- Then I'm younger. - What?

2128
01:32:28,720 --> 01:32:30,591
- Then I'm younger. - You want to be younger?

2129
01:32:35,161 --> 01:32:36,790
Didn't she just confess her feelings?

2130
01:32:36,791 --> 01:32:37,791
What's going on?

2131
01:32:37,792 --> 01:32:38,929
- She just went right in. - She just said that...

2132
01:32:38,930 --> 01:32:40,130
- I like this. - This is good.

2133
01:32:40,131 --> 01:32:41,131
I really like things like this.

2134
01:32:41,132 --> 01:32:42,700
- She... - I like things like this.

2135
01:32:42,701 --> 01:32:44,969
Probably only had her focus on that,

2136
01:32:44,970 --> 01:32:46,301
- so it just came out. - Right.

2137
01:32:46,430 --> 01:32:48,569
It's like a flash of thought,

2138
01:32:48,570 --> 01:32:49,900
instead of something cliché.

2139
01:32:50,070 --> 01:32:51,070
I really like this.

2140
01:32:51,071 --> 01:32:52,840
And she would have gathered her courage in that moment.

2141
01:32:52,841 --> 01:32:54,310
- Right. - Right.

2142
01:32:54,940 --> 01:32:56,381
I've only been with women younger than me.

2143
01:32:57,211 --> 01:32:58,610
I hadn't even been with someone who was the same age as me.

2144
01:33:00,720 --> 01:33:02,279
- Then I'm younger. - What?

2145
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:04,091
- Then I'm younger. - You want to be younger?

2146
01:33:06,190 --> 01:33:08,261
Jae Hyung said he preferred women who were younger than him.

2147
01:33:08,690 --> 01:33:10,860
So I told him I wanted to be younger than him.

2148
01:33:12,131 --> 01:33:13,430
With Ju Yeon,

2149
01:33:14,530 --> 01:33:15,961
I think she...

2150
01:33:16,761 --> 01:33:19,171
developed some feelings toward me.

2151
01:33:19,371 --> 01:33:22,270
I did notice where her feelings were headed.

2152
01:33:22,970 --> 01:33:25,411
"Do I feel similarly about her?"

2153
01:33:25,810 --> 01:33:27,640
I think I kept...

2154
01:33:27,980 --> 01:33:31,081
trying to check for myself.

2155
01:33:31,310 --> 01:33:33,051
(Se Seung and Yong Woo at Nami Island)

2156
01:33:34,650 --> 01:33:36,950
Should we toast marshmallows...

2157
01:33:36,951 --> 01:33:39,051
- and stare into the fire? - Yes. I like staring into fire.

2158
01:33:39,621 --> 01:33:40,661
It's on the stick.

2159
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:43,730
You don't think we'd burn them, do you?

2160
01:33:44,291 --> 01:33:46,390
Being slightly burnt makes them delicious.

2161
01:33:50,131 --> 01:33:51,171
It's on fire.

2162
01:33:52,230 --> 01:33:53,301
- Look. - Gosh.

2163
01:33:53,501 --> 01:33:54,640
Is that okay?

2164
01:33:55,140 --> 01:33:56,171
I'm putting on a fire show.

2165
01:33:57,711 --> 01:33:59,109
Can you teach me how to do this?

2166
01:33:59,110 --> 01:34:00,170
- It's easy. - It's easy.

2167
01:34:00,171 --> 01:34:02,179
Do I have to stand far away? I already burnt these.

2168
01:34:02,180 --> 01:34:03,610
- What do I do? - Look. What's wrong with these?

2169
01:34:03,780 --> 01:34:04,810
Teach me.

2170
01:34:05,011 --> 01:34:06,410
Can you teach me?

2171
01:34:06,411 --> 01:34:07,451
I don't want to.

2172
01:34:07,551 --> 01:34:08,621
I was rejected.

2173
01:34:10,150 --> 01:34:12,090
(They're showing him how to toast marshmallows.)

2174
01:34:12,091 --> 01:34:13,621
You're supposed to do it far away.

2175
01:34:13,961 --> 01:34:15,161
Or you do it...

2176
01:34:16,091 --> 01:34:17,461
little by little.

2177
01:34:18,030 --> 01:34:19,960
- Like this. - Right. Far away.

2178
01:34:19,961 --> 01:34:22,000
Let's do it far away. Is this right?

2179
01:34:22,001 --> 01:34:23,131
Do it like this, little by little.

2180
01:34:24,030 --> 01:34:26,229
It was a bit cool when you had them on fire.

2181
01:34:26,230 --> 01:34:27,671
- Right? - I want to do it again.

2182
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:29,800
After spending a day with her...

2183
01:34:29,801 --> 01:34:32,371
and toward the end, I did think that...

2184
01:34:33,011 --> 01:34:35,011
There's a lot of overlap between her and Ju Yeon.

2185
01:34:35,610 --> 01:34:37,210
Her personality itself...

2186
01:34:37,211 --> 01:34:40,780
is like the personality I've seen for over 20 years.

2187
01:34:41,121 --> 01:34:42,780
I think I felt like...

2188
01:34:42,951 --> 01:34:46,020
she was a little sister who I wanted to take care of.

2189
01:34:48,121 --> 01:34:49,220
- Is it done? - It's done.

2190
01:34:50,430 --> 01:34:51,430
It's good.

2191
01:34:51,431 --> 01:34:52,460
- It's good, right? - Yes.

2192
01:34:52,461 --> 01:34:54,131
This is my first time trying it, but it's good.

2193
01:34:56,230 --> 01:34:57,230
(Glancing.)

2194
01:34:57,231 --> 01:35:00,570
That pose is the correct pose...

2195
01:35:00,770 --> 01:35:01,900
because it actually warms you up.

2196
01:35:02,570 --> 01:35:03,810
You know you have to wink too, right?

2197
01:35:04,110 --> 01:35:05,610
- I'm doing it right now. - Me too.

2198
01:35:08,411 --> 01:35:09,581
Three, two, one.

2199
01:35:12,110 --> 01:35:14,220
I took... I took three pictures. I even took my selfie.

2200
01:35:14,520 --> 01:35:15,849
Thank you.

2201
01:35:15,850 --> 01:35:17,751
- Yes, keep it safe. - I will.

2202
01:35:17,951 --> 01:35:19,051
It's a gift.

2203
01:35:19,551 --> 01:35:21,791
(The gift)

2204
01:35:22,520 --> 01:35:23,621
Our first visit to Nami Island.

2205
01:35:23,890 --> 01:35:25,961
- We had so much fun. Really. - We had so much fun. Gosh.

2206
01:35:27,301 --> 01:35:30,060
(Cho A and Jung Sub's date in Gangwon Province)

2207
01:35:30,230 --> 01:35:33,100
(A coffee shop in Chuncheon)

2208
01:35:35,871 --> 01:35:36,900
Let's go inside.

2209
01:35:37,411 --> 01:35:39,171
This place is very vintage.

2210
01:35:41,911 --> 01:35:43,411
It's very pretty.

2211
01:35:44,711 --> 01:35:46,211
It feels like an old house, doesn't it?

2212
01:35:51,591 --> 01:35:52,649
It's good.

2213
01:35:52,650 --> 01:35:54,559
Coffee suits you so well.

2214
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:56,020
I really like coffee.

2215
01:35:56,461 --> 01:35:57,631
It suits you.

2216
01:35:58,961 --> 01:36:00,599
- Do you want to try it? - Can I take a sip?

2217
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:01,600
Yes.

2218
01:36:03,661 --> 01:36:07,599
- It feels like we're in old times. - Right.

2219
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:09,070
Do you know that orange juice bottle?

2220
01:36:09,270 --> 01:36:10,300
- Yes. - Yes.

2221
01:36:10,301 --> 01:36:12,510
We used to store barley tea in that bottle,

2222
01:36:12,511 --> 01:36:14,679
and they were always on the kitchen table.

2223
01:36:14,680 --> 01:36:16,081
My family did that. What about yours?

2224
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:18,279
- That one? - The one on the very top.

2225
01:36:18,280 --> 01:36:19,480
- That one? - Yes.

2226
01:36:19,711 --> 01:36:21,951
- Did you use it? - Yes, we did.

2227
01:36:23,051 --> 01:36:25,020
Maybe we're similar in age.

2228
01:36:26,791 --> 01:36:28,690
Houses with rafters like this...

2229
01:36:28,961 --> 01:36:30,421
Rafters... Roofs?

2230
01:36:30,890 --> 01:36:31,890
What?

2231
01:36:31,891 --> 01:36:33,160
- Rafters? - Rafters.

2232
01:36:33,161 --> 01:36:35,599
They're part of Hanoks with roof tiles.

2233
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:38,701
I like the interior designs that Hanoks usually have.

2234
01:36:39,270 --> 01:36:40,640
What are rafters?

2235
01:36:45,671 --> 01:36:46,741
(Exclaiming)

2236
01:36:48,081 --> 01:36:49,081
I see.

2237
01:36:53,051 --> 01:36:55,380
The wood on the ceilings are called rafters.

2238
01:36:55,381 --> 01:36:56,450
(Rafters: A series of wooden beams that...)

2239
01:36:56,451 --> 01:36:57,620
(support the weight of the roof and transfer it to the walls)

2240
01:36:57,621 --> 01:37:01,319
Before, when I came home after receiving the poster,

2241
01:37:01,320 --> 01:37:03,890
you kept saying "I'm proud of you."

2242
01:37:04,530 --> 01:37:05,729
"I raised you right."

2243
01:37:05,730 --> 01:37:08,059
"Gosh, I'm so proud." You kept saying that,

2244
01:37:08,060 --> 01:37:09,859
- so it was so funny. - It was?

2245
01:37:09,860 --> 01:37:12,469
I felt like you entered there representing us,

2246
01:37:12,470 --> 01:37:14,470
and then you came home after winning.

2247
01:37:15,301 --> 01:37:16,470
That's so funny.

2248
01:37:16,600 --> 01:37:17,939
You don't seem like someone...

2249
01:37:17,940 --> 01:37:19,371
- who would joke like that, so. - I see.

2250
01:37:19,671 --> 01:37:21,881
I think it's because you make me feel comfortable.

2251
01:37:22,440 --> 01:37:25,050
I don't joke around when I feel uncomfortable.

2252
01:37:25,051 --> 01:37:27,149
I do have that boundary.

2253
01:37:27,150 --> 01:37:28,849
But even at home,

2254
01:37:28,850 --> 01:37:31,450
you react well to what people say.

2255
01:37:31,451 --> 01:37:33,751
So I think that made me feel comfortable.

2256
01:37:34,520 --> 01:37:36,390
I just wanted to do that.

2257
01:37:37,991 --> 01:37:39,730
That time I came home late from work,

2258
01:37:39,991 --> 01:37:42,131
and you set the table for me.

2259
01:37:42,461 --> 01:37:44,099
You pushed the chocolate in front of me,

2260
01:37:44,100 --> 01:37:46,570
- I remember. - and you poured me wine.

2261
01:37:46,871 --> 01:37:50,241
Are you usually that sweet to people?

2262
01:37:51,570 --> 01:37:54,580
I didn't think I was,

2263
01:37:54,581 --> 01:37:56,140
- Yes. - but I'm not sure.

2264
01:37:56,581 --> 01:37:58,881
- I think it depends on the person. - It depends?

2265
01:38:00,820 --> 01:38:02,479
You don't help out just anyone?

2266
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:03,551
No, I don't.

2267
01:38:03,780 --> 01:38:05,451
I'm curious about your standards.

2268
01:38:10,631 --> 01:38:12,860
- Just how I feel. - I see.

2269
01:38:15,230 --> 01:38:16,400
That's it.

2270
01:38:18,171 --> 01:38:19,229
I see.

2271
01:38:19,230 --> 01:38:20,500
I have a question that...

2272
01:38:20,501 --> 01:38:22,769
I wanted to ask your sibling but didn't.

2273
01:38:22,770 --> 01:38:24,010
Older, younger, or the same age?

2274
01:38:24,011 --> 01:38:25,371
(I see.)

2275
01:38:27,011 --> 01:38:28,780
- I want to know. - You want to know?

2276
01:38:30,610 --> 01:38:32,279
- That's understandable. - Yes.

2277
01:38:32,280 --> 01:38:33,650
But I want to know about that too.

2278
01:38:33,850 --> 01:38:35,381
- For me, - Yes.

2279
01:38:35,751 --> 01:38:38,751
I prefer men who are older than me, without a doubt.

2280
01:38:39,220 --> 01:38:41,921
- Really? - It's like...

2281
01:38:43,060 --> 01:38:45,091
I guess...

2282
01:38:46,291 --> 01:38:50,360
I want someone I can lean on.

2283
01:38:51,631 --> 01:38:53,769
I like people who I can learn from...

2284
01:38:53,770 --> 01:38:55,500
and respect.

2285
01:38:55,501 --> 01:38:56,801
- I see. - Yes.

2286
01:38:57,140 --> 01:38:58,809
- I see. - Yes.

2287
01:38:58,810 --> 01:39:00,070
And I've never thought about...

2288
01:39:00,640 --> 01:39:02,109
dating men who are younger than me.

2289
01:39:02,110 --> 01:39:03,211
I see.

2290
01:39:04,180 --> 01:39:05,180
Okay.

2291
01:39:06,780 --> 01:39:10,150
Then what if you found out how old I am,

2292
01:39:10,421 --> 01:39:11,720
and I'm younger than you.

2293
01:39:12,190 --> 01:39:13,621
How do you think you'll feel?

2294
01:39:14,360 --> 01:39:16,621
- Well... - Was that too direct?

2295
01:39:18,230 --> 01:39:20,929
- Just answer comfortably. - Can I have some time?

2296
01:39:20,930 --> 01:39:22,001
Yes.

2297
01:39:23,501 --> 01:39:25,871
Because I never thought about that.

2298
01:39:26,930 --> 01:39:30,440
I don't think...

2299
01:39:31,871 --> 01:39:34,511
that would make a significant difference.

2300
01:39:35,581 --> 01:39:36,780
You think?

2301
01:39:37,241 --> 01:39:38,350
I think so.

2302
01:39:38,780 --> 01:39:39,810
I see.

2303
01:39:43,751 --> 01:39:46,951
I got a feeling about who...

2304
01:39:47,690 --> 01:39:49,190
Cho A would like.

2305
01:39:49,720 --> 01:39:50,991
I think Cho A would like Yong Woo.

2306
01:39:52,461 --> 01:39:54,961
Yong Woo is the best fit...

2307
01:39:55,261 --> 01:39:58,131
to the picture Cho A painted.

2308
01:39:59,030 --> 01:40:00,201
I...

2309
01:40:00,501 --> 01:40:02,371
(Hesitant)

2310
01:40:04,001 --> 01:40:05,341
For me, I really like...

2311
01:40:05,810 --> 01:40:07,841
the smile you show me...

2312
01:40:07,881 --> 01:40:10,411
when our eyes briefly meet.

2313
01:40:12,081 --> 01:40:14,220
I really like that, so...

2314
01:40:15,121 --> 01:40:16,750
But the thing is,

2315
01:40:16,751 --> 01:40:19,320
I don't know if I'm the only one who feels that way.

2316
01:40:20,320 --> 01:40:21,461
So I keep...

2317
01:40:21,690 --> 01:40:23,860
thinking about it.

2318
01:40:24,591 --> 01:40:25,690
I think...

2319
01:40:26,961 --> 01:40:28,230
it's really nice.

2320
01:40:37,741 --> 01:40:39,741
That compliment makes me feel good.

2321
01:40:39,970 --> 01:40:41,110
- It does? - Yes.

2322
01:40:43,140 --> 01:40:44,211
That's how I felt.

2323
01:40:46,011 --> 01:40:47,581
- I see. - Yes.

2324
01:40:49,881 --> 01:40:51,121
That's nice.

2325
01:40:52,451 --> 01:40:53,451
I feel embarrassed.

2326
01:40:54,560 --> 01:40:56,020
Very embarrassed.

2327
01:40:56,520 --> 01:40:58,131
Thank you for telling me.

2328
01:40:59,030 --> 01:41:00,360
I see.

2329
01:41:10,911 --> 01:41:12,269
I see.

2330
01:41:12,270 --> 01:41:15,411
I think Jung Sub mustered up his courage.

2331
01:41:15,541 --> 01:41:17,979
But Cho A's reaction was,

2332
01:41:17,980 --> 01:41:19,809
- "I see." - "Thank you."

2333
01:41:19,810 --> 01:41:21,620
- "Thank you." - "I see."

2334
01:41:21,621 --> 01:41:23,219
There's nothing after that.

2335
01:41:23,220 --> 01:41:25,620
- It should have been returned. - If she really had feelings...

2336
01:41:25,621 --> 01:41:27,460
With Se Seung,

2337
01:41:27,461 --> 01:41:29,760
he only has to express this much of his feelings,

2338
01:41:29,761 --> 01:41:31,189
and she returns it this much.

2339
01:41:31,190 --> 01:41:33,859
So it's easy to confirm how she feels.

2340
01:41:33,860 --> 01:41:35,160
- Yes, that's right. - But with...

2341
01:41:35,161 --> 01:41:38,569
Cho A, she's not the type with huge gestures.

2342
01:41:38,570 --> 01:41:41,639
So since he's not getting anything from her, he keeps trying.

2343
01:41:41,640 --> 01:41:42,871
Gosh, this is difficult.

2344
01:41:45,770 --> 01:41:48,439
(Please go to the address below. Chuncheon, Gangwon Province)

2345
01:41:48,440 --> 01:41:50,140
I think we're meeting up.

2346
01:41:50,850 --> 01:41:52,451
"We're all meeting up together."

2347
01:41:52,751 --> 01:41:55,121
I thought we were on separate dates.

2348
01:41:55,280 --> 01:41:57,081
"Are we all sleeping together?" was my thought.

2349
01:41:57,551 --> 01:41:58,719
"We're all sleeping together,"

2350
01:41:58,720 --> 01:42:01,160
"and maybe we'll have different accommodations."

2351
01:42:01,161 --> 01:42:02,591
That's all I thought.

2352
01:42:05,930 --> 01:42:08,399
"Everyone must have gotten this."

2353
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:10,660
"Then we're all meeting up together."

2354
01:42:10,661 --> 01:42:13,870
"We'll be able to see who and who went on a date with,"

2355
01:42:13,871 --> 01:42:16,470
"and I'll be able to figure out Jung Sub's feelings."

2356
01:42:16,671 --> 01:42:17,911
Let's go.

2357
01:42:19,871 --> 01:42:21,610
- Come on. - Come on.

2358
01:42:22,180 --> 01:42:23,780
I wonder what the place is, what we'll be doing there.

2359
01:42:23,881 --> 01:42:27,011
Once our ages are revealed, you think that will change things?

2360
01:42:27,581 --> 01:42:29,081
- No, not really. - Right?

2361
01:42:29,251 --> 01:42:31,450
- Me neither. - I feel like, since we don't know,

2362
01:42:31,451 --> 01:42:33,389
we get to see each other without any prejudice.

2363
01:42:33,390 --> 01:42:35,360
Getting to know people for who they are...

2364
01:42:36,091 --> 01:42:38,030
- is such a valuable experience. - Yes.

2365
01:42:41,930 --> 01:42:44,201
- Pork belly? - Pork belly.

2366
01:42:45,331 --> 01:42:46,969
- Hello. - Hello.

2367
01:42:46,970 --> 01:42:48,070
Hello.

2368
01:42:49,640 --> 01:42:51,270
It's been a while.

2369
01:42:51,341 --> 01:42:52,540
- Long time no see. - Hi, Yong Woo.

2370
01:42:52,541 --> 01:42:53,541
Right.

2371
01:42:53,911 --> 01:42:55,109
Let's hurry and brag.

2372
01:42:55,110 --> 01:42:56,179
Should we do it later?

2373
01:42:56,180 --> 01:42:59,251
- Brag about what? - Nothing can beat ours.

2374
01:43:00,150 --> 01:43:01,850
We did this too.

2375
01:43:02,350 --> 01:43:04,081
- Hair clips. - Where?

2376
01:43:04,451 --> 01:43:06,650
- Hair clips? - We all have them.

2377
01:43:07,421 --> 01:43:09,859
Do you want to see?

2378
01:43:09,860 --> 01:43:11,030
Should we show them?

2379
01:43:11,131 --> 01:43:12,230
Show us.

2380
01:43:12,661 --> 01:43:14,360
- Gosh. - Do you have any idea...

2381
01:43:15,301 --> 01:43:17,030
how cute these are? Goodness.

2382
01:43:17,831 --> 01:43:19,529
You're so cute. Can you keep them on?

2383
01:43:19,530 --> 01:43:21,741
- Okay. I can. - Me too.

2384
01:43:22,440 --> 01:43:23,940
I can.

2385
01:43:25,810 --> 01:43:27,070
It's like I'm watching a sitcom.

2386
01:43:28,211 --> 01:43:29,810
I can.

2387
01:43:32,081 --> 01:43:33,849
They even had hair clips in their hair.

2388
01:43:33,850 --> 01:43:36,020
They were like a trio. A trio of girls.

2389
01:43:36,921 --> 01:43:39,849
These three must have had a great time.

2390
01:43:39,850 --> 01:43:42,059
I'm curious about their trip.

2391
01:43:42,060 --> 01:43:43,920
But I don't want those hair clips...

2392
01:43:43,921 --> 01:43:45,690
to come near me.

2393
01:43:47,390 --> 01:43:50,060
If I knew how to drive, I would have on our way back.

2394
01:43:53,501 --> 01:43:54,541
It's all right.

2395
01:43:54,970 --> 01:43:56,440
I want...

2396
01:43:56,871 --> 01:43:59,010
you to fall asleep.

2397
01:43:59,011 --> 01:44:00,911
- I see. - Yes.

2398
01:44:01,140 --> 01:44:02,809
I want you to feel...

2399
01:44:02,810 --> 01:44:05,309
so relaxed that you can't fight it.

2400
01:44:05,310 --> 01:44:07,479
I already feel relaxed.

2401
01:44:07,480 --> 01:44:09,921
Makguksu. We just had makguksu and...

2402
01:44:10,121 --> 01:44:11,491
- Whole pork. - Okay.

2403
01:44:14,890 --> 01:44:17,059
If Se Seung sees them coming in together...

2404
01:44:17,060 --> 01:44:18,991
- I'm curious. - If she sees they're matching.

2405
01:44:19,190 --> 01:44:20,930
Them wearing matching clothes is huge.

2406
01:44:26,570 --> 01:44:27,570
You must be hungry.

2407
01:44:29,371 --> 01:44:31,769
- Hello. - You're here.

2408
01:44:31,770 --> 01:44:33,910
What? Are you two matching?

2409
01:44:33,911 --> 01:44:35,979
- You matched the colours. - You're dressed the same.

2410
01:44:35,980 --> 01:44:37,510
Somehow we ended up matching.

2411
01:44:37,511 --> 01:44:38,810
You're exactly matching.

2412
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:42,420
When we arrived, everyone...

2413
01:44:42,421 --> 01:44:45,750
talked about how we were wearing matching outfits.

2414
01:44:45,751 --> 01:44:47,389
To be honest,

2415
01:44:47,390 --> 01:44:50,020
I think I was embarrassed so I couldn't look at anyone.

2416
01:44:52,360 --> 01:44:55,360
- Matching clothes definitely... - Right.

2417
01:44:56,001 --> 01:44:58,429
Your outfits are really pretty.

2418
01:44:58,430 --> 01:45:00,631
- Denim on denim? - Denim on denim.

2419
01:45:03,201 --> 01:45:04,970
They were matching like couples.

2420
01:45:05,270 --> 01:45:09,280
But I didn't feel as jealous as I thought I would.

2421
01:45:09,411 --> 01:45:11,779
It didn't feel like love was blossoming between them.

2422
01:45:11,780 --> 01:45:13,780
More like they're comfortable with each other and closer.

2423
01:45:13,951 --> 01:45:16,050
I kind of felt like...

2424
01:45:16,051 --> 01:45:18,621
Yong Woo and Se Seung kind of...

2425
01:45:19,320 --> 01:45:20,650
seemed upset.

2426
01:45:20,850 --> 01:45:23,791
I couldn't look at Se Seung in her eyes.

2427
01:45:27,591 --> 01:45:29,160
What is this?

2428
01:45:29,161 --> 01:45:30,760
- Brag about your date. - What did you do?

2429
01:45:30,761 --> 01:45:32,830
- We played tennis. - Really?

2430
01:45:32,831 --> 01:45:35,370
- In Chuncheon? - Yes, near here.

2431
01:45:35,371 --> 01:45:37,069
You hate cardio, though.

2432
01:45:37,070 --> 01:45:39,770
So I kept flexing my muscles a little.

2433
01:45:40,070 --> 01:45:41,740
- So like when you served? - Like this?

2434
01:45:41,741 --> 01:45:43,279
I clenched my jaw.

2435
01:45:43,280 --> 01:45:44,950
- Did you play doubles? - No.

2436
01:45:44,951 --> 01:45:47,110
I mean, you're wearing matching uniforms.

2437
01:45:47,511 --> 01:45:49,180
We rallied one-on-one.

2438
01:45:49,251 --> 01:45:51,219
But Cho A was very good.

2439
01:45:51,220 --> 01:45:52,690
- Really? - At tennis?

2440
01:45:54,020 --> 01:45:57,790
I did want to play sports with my boyfriend.

2441
01:45:57,791 --> 01:46:00,030
I used to think that would be fun.

2442
01:46:00,131 --> 01:46:02,460
But he said they played tennis on their date,

2443
01:46:02,461 --> 01:46:04,331
and that Cho A was good at it.

2444
01:46:04,530 --> 01:46:06,030
So I was like, "I can be good at it too."

2445
01:46:07,900 --> 01:46:09,201
I'll grill some mushrooms.

2446
01:46:09,640 --> 01:46:11,510
I don't eat mushrooms. You two eat them.

2447
01:46:11,511 --> 01:46:12,671
Why don't you eat mushrooms?

2448
01:46:12,970 --> 01:46:15,440
- They don't taste good to me. - I see.

2449
01:46:16,310 --> 01:46:18,980
Saesongi will be sad to hear it.

2450
01:46:19,680 --> 01:46:21,149
Isn't this Saesongi mushroom?

2451
01:46:21,150 --> 01:46:22,179
(Park Se Seung, Nickname: Saesongi)

2452
01:46:22,180 --> 01:46:23,280
This is Saesongi mushroom?

2453
01:46:24,220 --> 01:46:25,720
- I'm not sure. - Me neither.

2454
01:46:29,060 --> 01:46:30,291
Medium heat?

2455
01:46:31,161 --> 01:46:33,690
- Should we... - Raise the heat a little?

2456
01:46:34,091 --> 01:46:35,900
Yes. So it heats up quickly.

2457
01:46:43,070 --> 01:46:44,140
- Cheers. - Cheers.

2458
01:46:46,841 --> 01:46:48,310
- Gosh, this is insane. - It's nice.

2459
01:46:50,411 --> 01:46:51,911
- It's nice. - It gives me energy.

2460
01:47:00,051 --> 01:47:01,921
I thought you weren't hungry?

2461
01:47:04,761 --> 01:47:06,690
Jae Hyung is good at grilling meat.

2462
01:47:06,791 --> 01:47:08,030
I love it.

2463
01:47:08,301 --> 01:47:09,701
- Grilling meat? - Yes.

2464
01:47:10,801 --> 01:47:11,831
That's great.

2465
01:47:12,831 --> 01:47:14,171
Hurry up and eat this.

2466
01:47:15,201 --> 01:47:17,470
(His legend goes back in time to their first day.)

2467
01:47:17,671 --> 01:47:19,270
I'm really good at grilling meat.

2468
01:47:19,871 --> 01:47:22,880
Seriously. All my friends...

2469
01:47:22,881 --> 01:47:24,109
gave me credit for it.

2470
01:47:24,110 --> 01:47:25,750
(The first day he met Ji Won)

2471
01:47:25,751 --> 01:47:27,011
I'm good at grilling meat.

2472
01:47:28,520 --> 01:47:30,921
(Even today, in the car)

2473
01:47:31,251 --> 01:47:32,551
Pork belly and pork shoulder.

2474
01:47:32,621 --> 01:47:34,520
It's not easy to grill pork shoulder well.

2475
01:47:36,421 --> 01:47:39,059
(Do you usually grill the meat when you go to a barbecue place?)

2476
01:47:39,060 --> 01:47:41,030
I like grilling.

2477
01:47:41,261 --> 01:47:43,460
Until grease is released,

2478
01:47:43,461 --> 01:47:46,570
you have to keep moving them off the grill.

2479
01:47:47,201 --> 01:47:48,840
Meat should be grilled without any pause.

2480
01:47:48,841 --> 01:47:50,940
Quickly while making sure none of it burns.

2481
01:47:51,310 --> 01:47:52,670
It's really amazing.

2482
01:47:52,671 --> 01:47:54,810
Your speed and accuracy.

2483
01:47:59,180 --> 01:48:01,279
Yes, it was good since I'm good at grilling.

2484
01:48:01,280 --> 01:48:02,751
(He's Banpo-dong's self-proclaimed master of grilling meat.)

2485
01:48:03,280 --> 01:48:04,951
The owner of this place is good at grilling meat.

2486
01:48:06,190 --> 01:48:08,319
- Gosh, Jae Hyung. - It wasn't intentional.

2487
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:09,421
He's good.

2488
01:48:11,261 --> 01:48:13,761
(Meanwhile, a man is watching them.)

2489
01:48:15,560 --> 01:48:18,270
(This man seems familiar.)

2490
01:48:19,371 --> 01:48:22,841
(He interviewed Cheol Hyeon and Jae Hyung last night.)

2491
01:48:24,470 --> 01:48:26,140
(It's Yun Jae.)

2492
01:48:26,871 --> 01:48:28,411
- When did you get here? - Just now.

2493
01:48:28,581 --> 01:48:29,979
- You got here just now? - Yes.

2494
01:48:29,980 --> 01:48:31,011
(He's Ji Won's sibling.)

2495
01:48:35,320 --> 01:48:36,979
- Gosh, he's hiding over there. - What?

2496
01:48:36,980 --> 01:48:39,319
- What is he doing there? - He's in hiding.

2497
01:48:39,320 --> 01:48:41,690
- What is he doing? - Right.

2498
01:48:47,161 --> 01:48:49,360
I'm currently in the restaurant business.

2499
01:48:49,530 --> 01:48:51,371
- Thank you. - Yes. Have a good day.

2500
01:48:52,301 --> 01:48:53,870
My mother has been in the restaurant business...

2501
01:48:53,871 --> 01:48:55,171
for ten years.

2502
01:48:56,470 --> 01:48:58,170
I've taken over one of her stores,

2503
01:48:58,171 --> 01:48:59,541
and I have been running it for three years.

2504
01:49:00,871 --> 01:49:02,881
- His job. - He's the owner?

2505
01:49:04,680 --> 01:49:06,279
He's the owner.

2506
01:49:06,280 --> 01:49:07,581
Then he should be there.

2507
01:49:08,121 --> 01:49:10,480
I thought he was wearing a costume.

2508
01:49:11,291 --> 01:49:12,650
He's the owner.

2509
01:49:12,921 --> 01:49:13,991
Gosh.

2510
01:49:14,921 --> 01:49:18,161
We have seven franchise stores in Chuncheon and Hongcheon.

2511
01:49:19,491 --> 01:49:21,029
Our goal is to expand to other areas...

2512
01:49:21,030 --> 01:49:23,161
and make this into a franchise.

2513
01:49:23,831 --> 01:49:28,140
(Kim Yun Jae, Runs a restaurant)

2514
01:49:29,171 --> 01:49:32,870
I haven't been to Gangwon Province in the winter.

2515
01:49:32,871 --> 01:49:35,610
Have I been to Gangwon Province in the winter?

2516
01:49:35,940 --> 01:49:37,109
(She was born and raised in Chuncheon.)

2517
01:49:37,110 --> 01:49:40,451
I haven't been to Gangwon Province a lot.

2518
01:49:40,881 --> 01:49:43,180
Is there any food you can think of in Gangwon Province?

2519
01:49:43,280 --> 01:49:44,751
In Gangwon Province?

2520
01:49:45,650 --> 01:49:47,750
(She wants to say pork belly.)

2521
01:49:47,751 --> 01:49:49,161
In Gangwon Province...

2522
01:49:50,261 --> 01:49:52,791
(Ji Won got a message.)

2523
01:49:53,860 --> 01:49:54,860
(Please go to the address below.)

2524
01:49:54,861 --> 01:49:56,099
(Pork Belly, Chuncheon, Gangwon Province)

2525
01:49:56,100 --> 01:49:58,070
(Startled)

2526
01:49:58,171 --> 01:50:00,170
(Your sibling, Yun Jae, is secretly watching the participants.)

2527
01:50:00,171 --> 01:50:02,639
(Don't make it obvious that you know him.)

2528
01:50:02,640 --> 01:50:04,001
(Nodding)

2529
01:50:04,600 --> 01:50:08,109
I was told the pork belly restaurant was our final destination.

2530
01:50:08,110 --> 01:50:09,309
I was surprised.

2531
01:50:09,310 --> 01:50:12,780
But it's not like I was flustered. It was more like,

2532
01:50:12,911 --> 01:50:15,551
"Will I get to eat Mom's cooking today?"

2533
01:50:16,020 --> 01:50:17,680
I was very excited.

2534
01:50:17,991 --> 01:50:20,690
I think we're having dinner here.

2535
01:50:20,890 --> 01:50:23,261
At the pork belly restaurant, Hansoop branch?

2536
01:50:23,320 --> 01:50:26,230
Why is it a barbecue, though? I'm going with you.

2537
01:50:26,360 --> 01:50:27,530
It doesn't really matter.

2538
01:50:28,100 --> 01:50:30,630
I do eat meat when I'm meeting up with other people.

2539
01:50:30,631 --> 01:50:31,831
- I see. - Yes.

2540
01:50:32,171 --> 01:50:33,801
(At her family's place, )

2541
01:50:36,140 --> 01:50:37,200
I think you'll like it.

2542
01:50:37,201 --> 01:50:40,640
(Yun Jae seems anxious for some reason.)

2543
01:50:41,680 --> 01:50:44,780
(Earlier, while they were headed to the restaurant...)

2544
01:50:50,581 --> 01:50:52,250
(Soon the participants will be here.)

2545
01:50:52,251 --> 01:50:54,990
(You have to choose a woman you want to go out on a date with.)

2546
01:50:54,991 --> 01:50:58,360
(Grill a piece of meat yourself and put it on her plate.)

2547
01:50:58,690 --> 01:50:59,961
Hello.

2548
01:51:01,661 --> 01:51:02,701
The seating is...

2549
01:51:17,881 --> 01:51:19,179
I was a bit nervous.

2550
01:51:19,180 --> 01:51:20,950
I am not the type to do such things well.

2551
01:51:20,951 --> 01:51:23,150
So my head was filled with thoughts.

2552
01:51:23,850 --> 01:51:25,121
Who will it be?

2553
01:51:25,421 --> 01:51:27,350
- I am so curious. - Who will it be?

2554
01:51:27,621 --> 01:51:30,260
- My hunch tells me it's Se Seung. - I think it's Ju Yeon.

2555
01:51:30,261 --> 01:51:31,730
I am so curious.

2556
01:51:34,491 --> 01:51:36,961
(Another person becomes thoughtful.)

2557
01:51:37,530 --> 01:51:39,630
Of course, I am interested. It concerns my children.

2558
01:51:39,631 --> 01:51:42,099
But my son is the type to become nervous about such things.

2559
01:51:42,100 --> 01:51:44,501
So I wondered if he would be able to do it.

2560
01:51:45,110 --> 01:51:47,570
- You went to Nami Island. - You went to Nami Island.

2561
01:51:47,841 --> 01:51:50,640
The woman in a light blue cardigan caught my eyes.

2562
01:51:50,810 --> 01:51:53,381
She seemed well-mannered and gentle.

2563
01:51:53,511 --> 01:51:55,150
I thought she was really nice.

2564
01:51:55,551 --> 01:51:56,750
Where is the restroom?

2565
01:51:56,751 --> 01:51:58,751
- It's outside, behind the building. - Outside.

2566
01:52:01,591 --> 01:52:04,720
(She can't take her eyes off.)

2567
01:52:04,860 --> 01:52:07,761
(Whom will the owner choose?)

2568
01:52:08,230 --> 01:52:10,429
Which cut of meat would you like?

2569
01:52:10,430 --> 01:52:12,069
- Beef brisket is a good choice. - Beef brisket.

2570
01:52:12,070 --> 01:52:13,529
- Four servings each. - Okay.

2571
01:52:13,530 --> 01:52:14,599
Four servings of beef brisket each.

2572
01:52:14,600 --> 01:52:16,171
(The meat master ordered beef brisket.)

2573
01:52:16,440 --> 01:52:18,740
Beef brisket gets cooked quickly,

2574
01:52:18,741 --> 01:52:21,640
so we ask the customers to grill it themselves.

2575
01:52:21,841 --> 01:52:23,511
That was the exact cut they ordered.

2576
01:52:23,780 --> 01:52:25,609
It was different from what I had imagined,

2577
01:52:25,610 --> 01:52:27,051
so I was quite taken aback.

2578
01:52:28,320 --> 01:52:31,350
Shall we eat more beef brisket after this or...

2579
01:52:31,591 --> 01:52:33,251
- Let's eat something else. - Okay. That sounds good.

2580
01:52:33,690 --> 01:52:35,490
Do you want our meat?

2581
01:52:35,491 --> 01:52:36,559
- Is there leftover? - Is there leftover?

2582
01:52:36,560 --> 01:52:37,590
Yes.

2583
01:52:37,591 --> 01:52:39,330
If you need more, we will give it to you.

2584
01:52:39,331 --> 01:52:40,830
Okay. Please grill it.

2585
01:52:40,831 --> 01:52:41,929
Really?

2586
01:52:41,930 --> 01:52:44,161
(They decide to continue eating beef brisket.)

2587
01:52:47,570 --> 01:52:49,240
(They are grilling the beef brisket themselves.)

2588
01:52:49,241 --> 01:52:51,240
(The meat is already flipped over and all.)

2589
01:52:51,241 --> 01:52:53,309
(I can't grill it for them.)

2590
01:52:53,310 --> 01:52:56,779
(The beef brisket was an unexpected variable.)

2591
01:52:56,780 --> 01:53:01,011
Jae Hyung, what did you eat for lunch?

2592
01:53:01,680 --> 01:53:04,319
- We had makguksu. - What did you eat?

2593
01:53:04,320 --> 01:53:05,719
That's right. You said that you had makguksu.

2594
01:53:05,720 --> 01:53:07,551
We also had...

2595
01:53:08,890 --> 01:53:10,220
a pork barbecue.

2596
01:53:12,230 --> 01:53:13,660
Would you like some pork belly?

2597
01:53:13,661 --> 01:53:15,201
(Would you like some pork belly?)

2598
01:53:18,770 --> 01:53:20,130
How about 2 servings of 3-layer pork belly...

2599
01:53:20,131 --> 01:53:21,469
and 2 servings of 5-layer pork belly?

2600
01:53:21,470 --> 01:53:23,300
- You are wise. - Good idea.

2601
01:53:23,301 --> 01:53:25,569
Sir, 2 servings of 3-layer pork belly...

2602
01:53:25,570 --> 01:53:26,841
and 2 servings of 5-layer pork belly, please.

2603
01:53:26,970 --> 01:53:28,840
They are ordering pork belly.

2604
01:53:28,841 --> 01:53:30,740
- Now is his chance. - Good.

2605
01:53:30,741 --> 01:53:32,410
- Would you like it? - I need to eat meat...

2606
01:53:32,411 --> 01:53:33,951
Jae Hyung grilled.

2607
01:53:34,251 --> 01:53:36,020
I am good at grilling pork too.

2608
01:53:36,350 --> 01:53:37,980
I am good at grilling pork too.

2609
01:53:39,251 --> 01:53:41,220
(The employees gather around when they order pork belly.)

2610
01:53:41,791 --> 01:53:43,690
(They come up with a plan.)

2611
01:53:44,020 --> 01:53:46,059
We will grill it ourselves at our table...

2612
01:53:46,060 --> 01:53:47,961
- and give it to you. - That's a good idea.

2613
01:53:48,461 --> 01:53:50,500
- No. - To whom will he give it?

2614
01:53:50,501 --> 01:53:52,270
Yun Jae needs to grill it himself.

2615
01:53:52,371 --> 01:53:53,969
Three, please.

2616
01:53:53,970 --> 01:53:56,041
(They turn off the grill at the women's table.)

2617
01:53:56,440 --> 01:53:58,309
(It's an emergency.)

2618
01:53:58,310 --> 01:54:00,469
(They want to grill the meat at the men's table.)

2619
01:54:00,470 --> 01:54:05,211
(Women won't grill more meat.)

2620
01:54:05,881 --> 01:54:07,450
(Pork belly only gets set up on the grill at the men's table.)

2621
01:54:07,451 --> 01:54:09,179
It suits you in a strange way.

2622
01:54:09,180 --> 01:54:10,251
What do you mean?

2623
01:54:11,320 --> 01:54:12,320
Meat Master.

2624
01:54:12,321 --> 01:54:13,750
Meat Master is ruining...

2625
01:54:13,751 --> 01:54:15,990
- the mission. - No, Meat Master.

2626
01:54:15,991 --> 01:54:18,831
He needs to grill the meat and put it on a woman's plate.

2627
01:54:20,730 --> 01:54:22,029
Three-layer pork belly and five-layer pork belly.

2628
01:54:22,030 --> 01:54:25,301
(He doesn't let go of the tongs.)

2629
01:54:25,530 --> 01:54:28,270
(He cooks the pork belly carefully.)

2630
01:54:28,440 --> 01:54:29,741
It's a bit burnt.

2631
01:54:30,541 --> 01:54:32,439
- Is it burnt? - Just a little bit.

2632
01:54:32,440 --> 01:54:34,210
I want to try a burnt piece.

2633
01:54:34,211 --> 01:54:37,240
The burnt pieces are crispy and tasty.

2634
01:54:37,241 --> 01:54:38,550
Here you go.

2635
01:54:38,551 --> 01:54:40,779
The expert grilled it. Please enjoy it.

2636
01:54:40,780 --> 01:54:42,480
Thank you for the meat.

2637
01:54:44,850 --> 01:54:46,291
I don't have a chance to do it.

2638
01:54:48,291 --> 01:54:49,319
You are good.

2639
01:54:49,320 --> 01:54:50,359
(While Yun Jae has a lonely fight)

2640
01:54:50,360 --> 01:54:52,261
It's no joke.

2641
01:54:52,991 --> 01:54:56,400
(His sibling arrives.)

2642
01:54:58,570 --> 01:55:00,100
Everyone is here.

2643
01:55:01,070 --> 01:55:03,171
- Is my hair okay? - Your hair?

2644
01:55:03,640 --> 01:55:04,841
Is it matted?

2645
01:55:05,411 --> 01:55:06,609
It looks fine.

2646
01:55:06,610 --> 01:55:08,381
- Really? - Yes.

2647
01:55:08,541 --> 01:55:10,780
- Your hair looks fine. It's pretty. - Does it look fine?

2648
01:55:12,551 --> 01:55:13,911
Everyone is here.

2649
01:55:15,421 --> 01:55:17,751
- Welcome. - Hello.

2650
01:55:18,820 --> 01:55:19,820
Your hair.

2651
01:55:20,390 --> 01:55:22,320
- What? - What is going on?

2652
01:55:22,560 --> 01:55:23,560
I didn't recognize you.

2653
01:55:23,561 --> 01:55:25,059
- How cute. - What do you think?

2654
01:55:25,060 --> 01:55:27,160
- She put on a cap. - He looks good.

2655
01:55:27,161 --> 01:55:29,060
- He looks good with any hairstyle. - I know.

2656
01:55:30,230 --> 01:55:32,201
It was funny to see him nervous.

2657
01:55:32,470 --> 01:55:34,200
The cap was for the shoot,

2658
01:55:34,201 --> 01:55:36,300
but I was really glad that I wore it.

2659
01:55:36,301 --> 01:55:40,010
I hid my face behind the visor and stole glances at him.

2660
01:55:40,011 --> 01:55:42,610
He did this to me.

2661
01:55:44,480 --> 01:55:47,110
- Kim Ji Won is the prettiest. - Be quiet.

2662
01:55:48,680 --> 01:55:51,020
I wasn't very interested in Ji Won's arrival.

2663
01:55:51,520 --> 01:55:52,551
I didn't feel anything.

2664
01:55:53,390 --> 01:55:54,991
Did you enjoy the date?

2665
01:55:55,291 --> 01:55:56,360
Did you have time for it?

2666
01:55:57,121 --> 01:55:58,889
We came here right away.

2667
01:55:58,890 --> 01:56:00,859
Did you eat anything? You must be hungry.

2668
01:56:00,860 --> 01:56:02,359
We need to eat.

2669
01:56:02,360 --> 01:56:03,701
What would you like, Ji Won?

2670
01:56:04,161 --> 01:56:05,429
- Meat? - Eat meat.

2671
01:56:05,430 --> 01:56:07,330
- We will grill it for you. - Yes.

2672
01:56:07,331 --> 01:56:09,570
- Really? - Beef brisket was tasty.

2673
01:56:10,140 --> 01:56:11,541
Pork...

2674
01:56:12,541 --> 01:56:14,610
(Pork...)

2675
01:56:14,911 --> 01:56:16,880
- Now is the chance. - That's good.

2676
01:56:16,881 --> 01:56:18,610
Pork belly.

2677
01:56:19,411 --> 01:56:20,751
Pork...

2678
01:56:21,921 --> 01:56:23,580
- Beef brisket? - Beef brisket.

2679
01:56:23,581 --> 01:56:25,220
It would be a hassle to grill pork belly.

2680
01:56:27,150 --> 01:56:28,220
Pork belly.

2681
01:56:29,560 --> 01:56:31,729
(It's beef brisket.)

2682
01:56:31,730 --> 01:56:34,791
(What should I do?)

2683
01:56:37,701 --> 01:56:39,429
- What? - There is more meat.

2684
01:56:39,430 --> 01:56:42,940
Isn't this meat you need to grill?

2685
01:56:43,400 --> 01:56:44,939
- Meat. - They ordered a lot.

2686
01:56:44,940 --> 01:56:46,139
Eat this too.

2687
01:56:46,140 --> 01:56:47,710
- Would you like this grilled? - Yes.

2688
01:56:47,711 --> 01:56:49,110
- Thank you. - All right.

2689
01:56:49,581 --> 01:56:50,911
It's nice.

2690
01:56:54,350 --> 01:56:55,850
Go in there.

2691
01:56:56,051 --> 01:56:57,121
That's good.

2692
01:56:57,520 --> 01:56:58,590
- That's good. - Okay.

2693
01:56:58,591 --> 01:56:59,650
He got this.

2694
01:56:59,791 --> 01:57:01,920
(He confidently greases the pan.)

2695
01:57:01,921 --> 01:57:05,230
We didn't eat it.

2696
01:57:05,461 --> 01:57:06,929
After eating beef brisket...

2697
01:57:06,930 --> 01:57:08,529
That's right. We had their beef brisket too.

2698
01:57:08,530 --> 01:57:11,230
(Amidst Meat Master's indifference, )

2699
01:57:11,430 --> 01:57:14,131
(he cuts the meat excitedly.)

2700
01:57:18,671 --> 01:57:20,640
Did you have a good day?

2701
01:57:21,211 --> 01:57:24,109
Ji Won, you are like the center of the group.

2702
01:57:24,110 --> 01:57:25,710
I entered like the birthday girl.

2703
01:57:25,711 --> 01:57:28,051
That's right. It feels like a birthday party.

2704
01:57:29,320 --> 01:57:31,719
(Did you think anything was suspicious about Yun Jae?)

2705
01:57:31,720 --> 01:57:34,149
He kept coming next to me.

2706
01:57:34,150 --> 01:57:38,690
So I thought, "I am sure there is a reason for this."

2707
01:57:39,291 --> 01:57:41,761
I gave him space.

2708
01:57:41,961 --> 01:57:45,030
Come on. It wasn't like that.

2709
01:57:45,530 --> 01:57:46,530
I wanted to do it.

2710
01:57:46,531 --> 01:57:49,940
(He leaves for a moment while the meat gets cooked.)

2711
01:57:53,371 --> 01:57:54,870
(Touching)

2712
01:57:54,871 --> 01:57:57,541
- Rain... - It rained here.

2713
01:57:58,041 --> 01:58:00,110
Shall I go there? Shall I go there for a second?

2714
01:58:00,810 --> 01:58:01,850
Meat Master, no.

2715
01:58:01,980 --> 01:58:04,850
- No. - Don't do it.

2716
01:58:05,451 --> 01:58:07,849
Shall I go there? Shall I go there for a second?

2717
01:58:07,850 --> 01:58:08,921
Yes.

2718
01:58:09,961 --> 01:58:12,190
Are you going over there to grill meat?

2719
01:58:14,091 --> 01:58:15,161
Meat Master.

2720
01:58:15,961 --> 01:58:18,631
Where is he? He should be next to the grill.

2721
01:58:21,070 --> 01:58:22,541
Are you going over there to grill meat?

2722
01:58:23,470 --> 01:58:24,670
Seriously.

2723
01:58:24,671 --> 01:58:27,411
- I need to do this right. - Thank you.

2724
01:58:28,110 --> 01:58:30,780
That's right. It's no joke.

2725
01:58:32,511 --> 01:58:34,051
For goodness' sake.

2726
01:58:35,350 --> 01:58:37,550
- The heat is too high. - It's a bit high.

2727
01:58:37,551 --> 01:58:39,551
- I should lower the heat. - Where is it?

2728
01:58:39,751 --> 01:58:41,690
- Where is it? - The meat is getting cooked.

2729
01:58:42,520 --> 01:58:44,421
I won't have a chance to give a piece of meat.

2730
01:58:45,121 --> 01:58:46,360
What? Hold on.

2731
01:58:48,860 --> 01:58:51,331
(While Meat Master is gone)

2732
01:58:51,831 --> 01:58:53,600
(Glancing over)

2733
01:58:54,230 --> 01:58:56,970
(He rushes over.)

2734
01:58:57,301 --> 01:59:00,469
- Now is the chance. - Hurry up.

2735
01:59:00,470 --> 01:59:03,341
Hurry up and put it on her plate. I don't care if it's cooked.

2736
01:59:08,381 --> 01:59:10,780
(The meat master is back.)

2737
01:59:14,520 --> 01:59:17,090
I will move the meat to make room for kimchi.

2738
01:59:17,091 --> 01:59:18,091
Okay.

2739
01:59:19,461 --> 01:59:24,131
(To whom will he deliver his interest?)

2740
01:59:24,400 --> 01:59:25,871
Who will it be? Hurry up.

2741
01:59:27,930 --> 01:59:28,970
Here you go.

2742
01:59:32,911 --> 01:59:36,840
(Yun Jae chose Yun Ha.)

2743
01:59:36,841 --> 01:59:38,041
- Yun Ha. - Yun Ha.

2744
01:59:39,350 --> 01:59:40,951
He is giving her a lot of meat.

2745
01:59:41,310 --> 01:59:43,179
He chose the same participant as his mother.

2746
01:59:43,180 --> 01:59:44,220
They had the same idea.

2747
01:59:44,320 --> 01:59:47,121
(Sighing)

2748
01:59:49,320 --> 01:59:52,429
Yun Ha caught my eyes,

2749
01:59:52,430 --> 01:59:54,590
so I gave her meat first.

2750
01:59:54,591 --> 01:59:56,800
(Was there another woman you considered besides Yun Ha?)

2751
01:59:56,801 --> 01:59:58,430
No, there wasn't another woman I considered.

2752
02:00:00,171 --> 02:00:03,371
(A bit earlier)

2753
02:00:07,110 --> 02:00:09,080
I didn't know that.

2754
02:00:09,081 --> 02:00:10,841
(Yun Jae messaged the crew without hesitation.)

2755
02:00:10,940 --> 02:00:13,810
(The one in a sky blue cardigan)

2756
02:00:14,011 --> 02:00:16,421
Everyone was smiling,

2757
02:00:16,581 --> 02:00:19,389
but Yun Ha looked more cheerful.

2758
02:00:19,390 --> 02:00:21,720
It caught my eyes.

2759
02:00:21,961 --> 02:00:23,920
(Did you see to whom Yun Jae gave meat?)

2760
02:00:23,921 --> 02:00:25,290
Yes, I saw.

2761
02:00:25,291 --> 02:00:27,160
The woman in a sky blue top.

2762
02:00:27,161 --> 02:00:29,801
I thought, "He has a good taste in women."

2763
02:00:32,770 --> 02:00:33,831
Thank goodness.

2764
02:00:35,940 --> 02:00:38,340
You grill meat with so much care.

2765
02:00:38,341 --> 02:00:39,371
Seriously.

2766
02:00:40,711 --> 02:00:43,640
I see that you need to flip it over continuously.

2767
02:00:43,841 --> 02:00:46,010
- The heat is high. - I see.

2768
02:00:46,011 --> 02:00:47,050
(Glancing over)

2769
02:00:47,051 --> 02:00:48,719
At first...

2770
02:00:48,720 --> 02:00:51,620
It was my mission to deliver the pink envelope...

2771
02:00:51,621 --> 02:00:54,389
to the participant I liked as Ji Won's date.

2772
02:00:54,390 --> 02:00:56,090
It was a good chance...

2773
02:00:56,091 --> 02:00:58,091
to see the male participants up close.

2774
02:01:00,131 --> 02:01:02,630
I saw the tallest one sitting down.

2775
02:01:02,631 --> 02:01:05,300
I thought he could be...

2776
02:01:05,301 --> 02:01:06,969
the oldest participant.

2777
02:01:06,970 --> 02:01:09,500
I want Ji Won to date someone who is older than her.

2778
02:01:09,501 --> 02:01:10,741
He seemed prudent.

2779
02:01:11,570 --> 02:01:14,640
But the man in the yellow top looked so pretty.

2780
02:01:15,241 --> 02:01:17,841
- I need to do this right. - Thank you.

2781
02:01:18,041 --> 02:01:19,380
When Ji Won came,

2782
02:01:19,381 --> 02:01:21,551
he actively grilled the meat.

2783
02:01:21,911 --> 02:01:23,950
He talked to Ji Won nonstop.

2784
02:01:23,951 --> 02:01:25,849
"Ji Won, are you going to wear a hat tomorrow as well?"

2785
02:01:25,850 --> 02:01:27,890
"I am going to wear a hat too."

2786
02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:29,660
Are you going to wear a hat tomorrow?

2787
02:01:29,661 --> 02:01:32,291
I am going to wear a hat tomorrow morning too.

2788
02:01:33,030 --> 02:01:35,429
I smiled in the kitchen and thought to myself,

2789
02:01:35,430 --> 02:01:36,631
"You must be interested."

2790
02:01:38,100 --> 02:01:40,429
She really is her parent.

2791
02:01:40,430 --> 02:01:41,871
- She is different. - She is like the Bionic Woman.

2792
02:01:42,201 --> 02:01:43,371
Whom will she pick?

2793
02:01:44,600 --> 02:01:46,541
(Rustling)

2794
02:01:46,640 --> 02:01:49,240
I know it. Back in the day...

2795
02:01:49,241 --> 02:01:50,241
(She sets off with the pink envelope.)

2796
02:01:50,242 --> 02:01:51,310
It's...

2797
02:01:53,251 --> 02:01:56,020
(She is between Jae Hyung and Yong Woo.)

2798
02:01:56,581 --> 02:01:57,621
What?

2799
02:01:59,020 --> 02:02:00,091
What is it?

2800
02:02:00,390 --> 02:02:02,261
(She spots her mom.)

2801
02:02:02,461 --> 02:02:04,160
(The 2 son-in-law candidates)

2802
02:02:04,161 --> 02:02:06,430
The name of the pig is Chris P Bacon.

2803
02:02:08,430 --> 02:02:10,530
- I will take it over. - Okay. Thank you.

2804
02:02:11,001 --> 02:02:13,130
Is the name Chris P Bacon?

2805
02:02:13,131 --> 02:02:14,830
- What? No way. - What is it?

2806
02:02:14,831 --> 02:02:16,100
- What? - Is the name Chris P Bacon?

2807
02:02:20,511 --> 02:02:22,110
Is the name Chris P Bacon?

2808
02:02:22,881 --> 02:02:24,011
No way.

2809
02:02:25,850 --> 02:02:27,250
(What? No way.)

2810
02:02:27,251 --> 02:02:29,019
(Leaving)

2811
02:02:29,020 --> 02:02:30,020
This is...

2812
02:02:30,381 --> 02:02:32,890
You know, today...

2813
02:02:33,520 --> 02:02:36,260
I have a dream of seeing...

2814
02:02:36,261 --> 02:02:39,360
Ji Won date someone upright.

2815
02:02:39,961 --> 02:02:41,059
(As soon as they sat down)

2816
02:02:41,060 --> 02:02:42,831
- That's right. - It's here.

2817
02:02:43,600 --> 02:02:44,760
Thank you.

2818
02:02:44,761 --> 02:02:47,270
(Yong Woo set a wet wipe, a spoon, and chopsticks at each seat.)

2819
02:02:48,331 --> 02:02:50,469
He took out spoons and chopsticks...

2820
02:02:50,470 --> 02:02:52,710
and set them at each seat.

2821
02:02:52,711 --> 02:02:55,780
I thought he was upright and nice.

2822
02:02:56,980 --> 02:03:00,011
She studied their behaviours.

2823
02:03:00,081 --> 02:03:02,421
- He wasn't wearing a hairpin. - I know.

2824
02:03:03,680 --> 02:03:04,819
He is popular.

2825
02:03:04,820 --> 02:03:07,650
He has the looks that would get the parents' approval.

2826
02:03:07,751 --> 02:03:09,960
I think my mom would like Yong Woo.

2827
02:03:09,961 --> 02:03:12,729
He has the looks my mom likes.

2828
02:03:12,730 --> 02:03:16,029
My mom likes people with refreshing looks these days.

2829
02:03:16,030 --> 02:03:18,261
That's probably why she gave it to Yong Woo.

2830
02:03:18,530 --> 02:03:20,970
I think Jae Hyung suits Ji Won more.

2831
02:03:22,400 --> 02:03:23,500
This is...

2832
02:03:23,501 --> 02:03:24,501
(Confused)

2833
02:03:24,502 --> 02:03:26,241
Seriously, I got goosebumps.

2834
02:03:27,871 --> 02:03:30,341
- Until when will this happen? - The doorbell...

2835
02:03:30,610 --> 02:03:31,980
Seriously.

2836
02:03:32,011 --> 02:03:33,381
My goodness.

2837
02:03:34,051 --> 02:03:35,280
- I will read it. - Okay.

2838
02:03:35,650 --> 02:03:37,320
"The lodgings we prepared for today are..."

2839
02:03:37,421 --> 02:03:40,420
"a 4-person room, a 3-person room, and a 2-person room."

2840
02:03:40,421 --> 02:03:42,051
"There are three options."

2841
02:03:42,761 --> 02:03:44,420
- A 2-person room? - There is a 2-person room.

2842
02:03:44,421 --> 02:03:46,460
- A 2-person room? - What's up with the 2-person room?

2843
02:03:46,461 --> 02:03:47,929
A two-person room would be very nice.

2844
02:03:47,930 --> 02:03:50,460
- A 2-person room? - A 2-person room is...

2845
02:03:50,461 --> 02:03:53,029
- A two-person room. - It's too... Like...

2846
02:03:53,030 --> 02:03:54,099
They are grown-ups.

2847
02:03:54,100 --> 02:03:55,741
It suddenly became an American show.

2848
02:03:55,940 --> 02:03:59,269
"The couples that went on a date today should pick a card..."

2849
02:03:59,270 --> 02:04:01,270
"to decide on the lodging."

2850
02:04:01,440 --> 02:04:02,511
(My goodness)

2851
02:04:03,381 --> 02:04:07,349
"The three-person room will be used by Ju Yeon, Yun Ha,"

2852
02:04:07,350 --> 02:04:09,020
"and Jae Hyung."

2853
02:04:10,220 --> 02:04:11,320
Really?

2854
02:04:13,850 --> 02:04:17,161
There were rooms for 2, 3, and 4 people.

2855
02:04:17,291 --> 02:04:20,390
Since we were a group of three, we came to the room together.

2856
02:04:20,791 --> 02:04:24,029
The three pairs who went on a date had to decide...

2857
02:04:24,030 --> 02:04:26,100
whether to use a 4-person room or a 2-person room.

2858
02:04:26,371 --> 02:04:28,399
Is the lodging only decided for us?

2859
02:04:28,400 --> 02:04:31,201
- Yes, it's just us. - I see. It's only decided for us.

2860
02:04:31,900 --> 02:04:32,969
I was happy about the three-person room.

2861
02:04:32,970 --> 02:04:34,011
I thought, "Thank goodness."

2862
02:04:34,341 --> 02:04:35,841
"A 3-person room is better than a 2-person room."

2863
02:04:36,341 --> 02:04:38,340
I was relieved.

2864
02:04:38,341 --> 02:04:40,880
A two-person room would have been awkward.

2865
02:04:40,881 --> 02:04:44,080
The three of us became close and travelled together,

2866
02:04:44,081 --> 02:04:46,451
so I liked the idea of sharing the lodging.

2867
02:04:47,451 --> 02:04:48,921
I will hold the cards...

2868
02:04:49,091 --> 02:04:50,860
- since it has been decided for me. - Okay.

2869
02:04:51,190 --> 02:04:52,190
(1 2-person room card, 2 4-person room cards)

2870
02:04:52,191 --> 02:04:54,791
The cards will determine the results.

2871
02:04:55,060 --> 02:04:57,600
- Other teams will choose. - Three teams, pick a card.

2872
02:04:58,301 --> 02:05:00,600
- Then I will pick a card. - Okay.

2873
02:05:03,640 --> 02:05:04,900
My goodness.

2874
02:05:05,570 --> 02:05:07,411
- Drum roll. - You must be nervous.

2875
02:05:11,541 --> 02:05:13,451
"Please let it be a four-people room."

2876
02:05:13,780 --> 02:05:17,349
Sharing the room with Jung Sub would be the best.

2877
02:05:17,350 --> 02:05:18,350
If it didn't come to that,

2878
02:05:18,351 --> 02:05:20,190
I still wanted to use the 4-person room.

2879
02:05:20,251 --> 02:05:22,860
I worried about what Jung Sub would think.

2880
02:05:24,060 --> 02:05:25,960
If Jung Sub feels the same way about me...

2881
02:05:25,961 --> 02:05:28,830
even after the date ends today,

2882
02:05:28,831 --> 02:05:31,859
he would feel uncomfortable about me using a two-person room.

2883
02:05:31,860 --> 02:05:34,701
That was why I wanted to use the four-person room.

2884
02:05:35,131 --> 02:05:36,939
We would have gone to the two-person room...

2885
02:05:36,940 --> 02:05:40,769
with our siblings watching.

2886
02:05:40,770 --> 02:05:42,280
So I wanted to avoid that.

2887
02:05:45,411 --> 02:05:47,751
Since I am going 1st, I will choose the 1st card.

2888
02:05:48,551 --> 02:05:49,850
- Shall I pick one? - Yes.

2889
02:05:52,180 --> 02:05:53,889
I will pick this one.

2890
02:05:53,890 --> 02:05:55,591
(Jung Sub and Cho A's lodging card)

2891
02:05:55,921 --> 02:05:57,690
This is nerve-racking. I am nervous.

2892
02:05:58,320 --> 02:05:59,791
My mind is at ease.

2893
02:06:00,230 --> 02:06:01,529
Seriously.

2894
02:06:01,530 --> 02:06:04,500
I didn't get to spend a lot of time with Ji Won.

2895
02:06:04,501 --> 02:06:05,630
So I thought the two-person room would be nice.

2896
02:06:05,631 --> 02:06:08,430
What would we talk about if we share the same room?

2897
02:06:08,570 --> 02:06:12,440
- Shall we open it now? - Yes.

2898
02:06:13,341 --> 02:06:15,469
- Who will use the two-person room? - I know.

2899
02:06:15,470 --> 02:06:18,240
- Who will use the two-person room? - Who will use it?

2900
02:06:18,241 --> 02:06:20,350
- One, two, three. - Two, three.

2901
02:06:21,011 --> 02:06:23,019
The 4-person room, the 2-person room.

2902
02:06:23,020 --> 02:06:24,381
(4-person room: Yong Woo, Se Seung, Ji Won, and Cheol Hyeon)

2903
02:06:25,480 --> 02:06:27,390
We got the two-person room.

2904
02:06:28,621 --> 02:06:30,161
Did Jung Sub and Cho A get the two-person room?

2905
02:06:30,621 --> 02:06:32,831
- Look at Se Seung's face. - Se Seung.

2906
02:06:35,390 --> 02:06:39,069
(Jung Sub and Cho A will use the 2-person room.)

2907
02:06:39,070 --> 02:06:40,400
I see.

2908
02:06:42,270 --> 02:06:43,541
Who got the two-person room?

2909
02:06:44,041 --> 02:06:45,770
I see.

2910
02:06:51,081 --> 02:06:53,550
Yong Woo was sitting across from me.

2911
02:06:53,551 --> 02:06:57,381
Yong Woo looked a bit unhappy.

2912
02:06:57,650 --> 02:06:59,620
I saw Se Seung. Of course, I saw Se Seung.

2913
02:06:59,621 --> 02:07:02,390
Se Seung looked dissatisfied too.

2914
02:07:04,190 --> 02:07:05,291
I was disappointed.

2915
02:07:05,560 --> 02:07:08,559
Had Jung Sub and Cho A gotten the four-person room,

2916
02:07:08,560 --> 02:07:09,961
everyone would have been happy.

2917
02:07:15,371 --> 02:07:18,500
Jung Sub was very considerate of me.

2918
02:07:18,501 --> 02:07:21,041
He made me feel comfortable, so I wasn't very worried.

2919
02:07:21,110 --> 02:07:24,240
I was excited about going to a quiet place...

2920
02:07:24,241 --> 02:07:26,979
after spending time with a lot of people...

2921
02:07:26,980 --> 02:07:28,251
in the house.

2922
02:07:28,581 --> 02:07:31,051
It would be a lie to say that I didn't mind at all.

2923
02:07:31,381 --> 02:07:34,350
But I thought, "Nothing will happen."

2924
02:07:35,350 --> 02:07:37,859
When the two of them entered the restaurant,

2925
02:07:37,860 --> 02:07:39,059
they would school their faces.

2926
02:07:39,060 --> 02:07:41,260
But now, they can't school their faces.

2927
02:07:41,261 --> 02:07:44,429
They must be seething with anger internally.

2928
02:07:44,430 --> 02:07:46,100
I bet they want to down the raspberry wine.

2929
02:07:46,270 --> 02:07:48,670
They must be really jealous.

2930
02:07:48,671 --> 02:07:50,270
They must be really annoyed.

2931
02:07:52,070 --> 02:07:53,671
Why are there so many cards?

2932
02:07:54,640 --> 02:07:56,740
(The couples that went on a date today should pick a card.)

2933
02:07:56,741 --> 02:07:58,810
(Tomorrow, you will go on a double date as two teams.)

2934
02:07:58,881 --> 02:08:02,349
"Tomorrow, you will go on a double date as two teams."

2935
02:08:02,350 --> 02:08:06,020
"Team A consists of 4 people in the 4-person room."

2936
02:08:06,650 --> 02:08:09,421
- Do you want to get down? - Get down.

2937
02:08:10,060 --> 02:08:14,860
"Team B consists of 5 people in the 3 and 2-person rooms."

2938
02:08:17,730 --> 02:08:19,501
It feels like an amusement park ride.

2939
02:08:22,570 --> 02:08:24,769
So who are in the four-person room?

2940
02:08:24,770 --> 02:08:26,769
- Ji Won, me... - The four of us.

2941
02:08:26,770 --> 02:08:28,309
- The 4 of us. - The 4 of us.

2942
02:08:28,310 --> 02:08:29,439
Se Seung and...

2943
02:08:29,440 --> 02:08:31,180
(The members of the 4-person room will go on a double date.)

2944
02:08:32,140 --> 02:08:33,211
Interesting.

2945
02:08:35,310 --> 02:08:36,319
I was disappointed.

2946
02:08:36,320 --> 02:08:40,120
Ji Won is the type to talk more when she is alone with me.

2947
02:08:40,121 --> 02:08:43,560
She doesn't talk much when she is with other people.

2948
02:08:44,220 --> 02:08:45,591
So I felt that way.

2949
02:08:46,890 --> 02:08:48,630
Can I read it?

2950
02:08:48,631 --> 02:08:50,461
- Okay. - I don't understand it today.

2951
02:08:50,900 --> 02:08:53,030
Will you finally join our team?

2952
02:08:53,871 --> 02:08:55,301
The team is always open.

2953
02:08:55,430 --> 02:08:56,670
- It's always open. - No, thank you.

2954
02:08:56,671 --> 02:08:57,900
We are recruiting new members.

2955
02:08:58,501 --> 02:09:01,371
- Don't hesitate. - She couldn't hear you.

2956
02:09:04,211 --> 02:09:05,479
There were so many cards.

2957
02:09:05,480 --> 02:09:10,650
(On the 8th day, who made your heart flutter?)

2958
02:09:10,921 --> 02:09:11,951
- Now? - Finally.

2959
02:09:12,491 --> 02:09:14,490
What's up with the timing?

2960
02:09:14,491 --> 02:09:15,491
I love it.

2961
02:09:15,820 --> 02:09:17,490
This is the moment I have been waiting for.

2962
02:09:17,491 --> 02:09:18,689
Is it only the eighth day?

2963
02:09:18,690 --> 02:09:20,060
It's important.

2964
02:09:20,230 --> 02:09:21,630
At this point,

2965
02:09:21,631 --> 02:09:24,300
- you need to use techniques. - That's right.

2966
02:09:24,301 --> 02:09:26,000
- You should be able to use it. - Yes.

2967
02:09:26,001 --> 02:09:28,969
As a warning, they should stop sending...

2968
02:09:28,970 --> 02:09:30,569
a message or something.

2969
02:09:30,570 --> 02:09:31,969
They need to use skills.

2970
02:09:31,970 --> 02:09:33,540
- It's like a disaster alert. - Yes.

2971
02:09:33,541 --> 02:09:34,640
My goodness.

2972
02:09:35,470 --> 02:09:37,411
(On the 8th day, who made your heart flutter?)

2973
02:09:40,310 --> 02:09:41,680
Ji Won, is it your first time?

2974
02:09:42,011 --> 02:09:44,520
- No. - It's her second time.

2975
02:09:48,820 --> 02:09:50,961
It was the hardest decision in the world.

2976
02:09:51,261 --> 02:09:52,491
I thought about it a lot.

2977
02:09:53,190 --> 02:09:54,889
(To Yong Woo: Thank you for driving today!)

2978
02:09:54,890 --> 02:09:56,860
(To Yong Woo)

2979
02:10:17,121 --> 02:10:20,020
I wondered whom I should message.

2980
02:10:20,150 --> 02:10:23,820
I thought both of them would message me.

2981
02:10:25,961 --> 02:10:28,430
The two of them got along very well,

2982
02:10:28,591 --> 02:10:30,830
so I wondered if I was being the third wheel.

2983
02:10:30,831 --> 02:10:32,201
I felt a sense of distance.

2984
02:10:33,570 --> 02:10:36,400
(Would it be okay if I don't send a message?)

2985
02:10:36,970 --> 02:10:40,341
I felt like Jae Hyung wasn't interested in me.

2986
02:10:40,770 --> 02:10:42,269
So I didn't know what to do.

2987
02:10:42,270 --> 02:10:44,810
It was the most difficult decision.

2988
02:10:58,520 --> 02:11:02,430
(Everyone delivered their feelings.)

2989
02:11:03,331 --> 02:11:05,400
Do you snore?

2990
02:11:05,631 --> 02:11:07,429
I don't think I snore.

2991
02:11:07,430 --> 02:11:09,300
He doesn't snore much. He doesn't snore at all.

2992
02:11:09,301 --> 02:11:10,370
Do you want earplugs?

2993
02:11:10,371 --> 02:11:13,040
I gave you a container of 100 earplugs.

2994
02:11:13,041 --> 02:11:15,340
I am using them recklessly. I already used six of them.

2995
02:11:15,341 --> 02:11:17,180
- I want you to use them more. - Okay.

2996
02:11:17,211 --> 02:11:19,581
I want you to wake up at 3am and replace them.

2997
02:11:20,251 --> 02:11:23,280
I am a bit sad that you only use one pair a day.

2998
02:11:27,251 --> 02:11:31,461
(Let's talk some more.)

2999
02:11:31,720 --> 02:11:33,991
I think it's Ji Won.

3000
02:11:34,060 --> 02:11:36,560
But maybe I will find out later that I was mistaken.

3001
02:11:37,161 --> 02:11:38,859
I sent it to Cheol Hyeon.

3002
02:11:38,860 --> 02:11:41,399
I think we got along.

3003
02:11:41,400 --> 02:11:43,240
I thought he might message me...

3004
02:11:43,241 --> 02:11:45,900
if he felt the same thing.

3005
02:11:50,081 --> 02:11:52,309
(You must be tired.)

3006
02:11:52,310 --> 02:11:54,580
(I like that we have many things in common.)

3007
02:11:54,581 --> 02:11:57,450
I felt very comfortable when we talked.

3008
02:11:57,451 --> 02:11:59,820
I want to talk to her more.

3009
02:12:00,220 --> 02:12:04,791
(Cheol Hyeon and Ji Won chose each other.)

3010
02:12:06,091 --> 02:12:07,560
More than I expected...

3011
02:12:08,631 --> 02:12:10,261
Maybe there will be a double bed.

3012
02:12:12,230 --> 02:12:13,929
I doubt that.

3013
02:12:13,930 --> 02:12:17,440
(I want to wear the yellow hair clip tomorrow.)

3014
02:12:18,541 --> 02:12:19,610
A double bed?

3015
02:12:22,140 --> 02:12:23,940
I sent it to Jae Hyung.

3016
02:12:24,110 --> 02:12:28,309
We talked about switching the hair clips tomorrow.

3017
02:12:28,310 --> 02:12:31,520
So I sent, "I want to wear the yellow hair clip tomorrow."

3018
02:12:31,951 --> 02:12:33,520
Like a glamping place...

3019
02:12:36,720 --> 02:12:39,890
(Let's have fun tomorrow as well.)

3020
02:12:40,291 --> 02:12:42,059
I think Ju Yeon sent the one about the yellow hair clip...

3021
02:12:42,060 --> 02:12:44,560
and Yun Ha sent the one about having fun.

3022
02:12:49,600 --> 02:12:51,770
I sent it to Jae Hyung.

3023
02:12:51,970 --> 02:12:53,870
"He doesn't see me as a woman."

3024
02:12:53,871 --> 02:12:56,510
I got that feeling a lot,

3025
02:12:56,511 --> 02:12:58,810
so I was quite torn.

3026
02:13:01,180 --> 02:13:04,421
(To whom did Jae Hyung send a message?)

3027
02:13:05,121 --> 02:13:06,921
Whom did Meat Master choose?

3028
02:13:07,150 --> 02:13:08,890
Who will receive a message from M.M.?

3029
02:13:16,730 --> 02:13:19,399
(I hope we will get to spend...)

3030
02:13:19,400 --> 02:13:21,970
(more time together.)

3031
02:13:22,570 --> 02:13:24,171
I was incredibly happy.

3032
02:13:24,570 --> 02:13:26,370
I didn't think that I would receive a message.

3033
02:13:26,371 --> 02:13:28,639
I thought he would send a message to Yun Ha.

3034
02:13:28,640 --> 02:13:30,081
It felt like a present...

3035
02:13:30,280 --> 02:13:32,751
I received for struggling all day long.

3036
02:13:36,011 --> 02:13:39,319
The emoticon suited Jae Hyung,

3037
02:13:39,320 --> 02:13:40,320
so it was cute.

3038
02:13:41,890 --> 02:13:44,020
I sent it to Ju Yeon.

3039
02:13:44,161 --> 02:13:48,131
It became harder to approach her.

3040
02:13:54,030 --> 02:13:57,200
I don't know if it became harder to approach her...

3041
02:13:57,201 --> 02:13:58,470
because I see her as a woman.

3042
02:13:58,570 --> 02:14:01,741
I thought I would find out by spending more time with her.

3043
02:14:05,511 --> 02:14:09,881
(Two people chose your sibling.)

3044
02:14:13,320 --> 02:14:15,421
I bet he received the messages from Ju Yeon and Yun Ha.

3045
02:14:15,451 --> 02:14:16,819
At first, I thought, "What's up with him?"

3046
02:14:16,820 --> 02:14:18,389
Then I remembered that he had gone on a date with two women.

3047
02:14:18,390 --> 02:14:20,131
Right after that...

3048
02:14:25,261 --> 02:14:26,270
"What?"

3049
02:14:28,230 --> 02:14:29,770
The realization dawned on me.

3050
02:14:31,201 --> 02:14:35,070
(She only received a message regarding her sibling.)

3051
02:14:35,211 --> 02:14:37,841
I didn't receive a message from anyone.

3052
02:14:38,610 --> 02:14:40,951
- Oh, no. - My goodness.

3053
02:14:41,150 --> 02:14:43,381
What's going on? I can't believe it.

3054
02:14:44,381 --> 02:14:46,020
Jung Sub was serious.

3055
02:14:46,621 --> 02:14:47,621
My goodness.

3056
02:14:48,291 --> 02:14:50,820
I didn't receive a message from anyone.

3057
02:14:51,661 --> 02:14:54,030
The first thought was, "I am so disappointed."

3058
02:14:54,560 --> 02:14:56,060
The second thought was,

3059
02:14:57,131 --> 02:14:59,671
"Someone captivated him."

3060
02:15:01,371 --> 02:15:04,041
He must have sent a message to someone.

3061
02:15:06,041 --> 02:15:08,170
Until I saw Jung Sub at the barbecue place,

3062
02:15:08,171 --> 02:15:10,581
I was going to send a message to Yong Woo.

3063
02:15:10,810 --> 02:15:13,211
What? The two of you are wearing matching outfits.

3064
02:15:14,780 --> 02:15:18,450
But as soon as Jung Sub appeared, my heart fluttered.

3065
02:15:18,451 --> 02:15:21,190
I thought about what I should do.

3066
02:15:29,801 --> 02:15:34,530
(I had a fun day. Thank you.)

3067
02:15:34,831 --> 02:15:36,241
I sent it to Yong Woo.

3068
02:15:36,770 --> 02:15:38,870
Until now, I focused on...

3069
02:15:38,871 --> 02:15:40,871
who made my heart flutter.

3070
02:15:40,970 --> 02:15:43,510
But today, I wanted to thank Yong Woo...

3071
02:15:43,511 --> 02:15:46,250
for making the date fun. So I sent a simple message.

3072
02:15:46,251 --> 02:15:47,751
"I had fun. Thank you."

3073
02:16:01,860 --> 02:16:04,030
I think Jung Sub sent a message to Cho A.

3074
02:16:04,131 --> 02:16:07,229
"He probably sent it to Cho A for the same reasons as mine."

3075
02:16:07,230 --> 02:16:08,570
I consoled myself with that thought.

3076
02:16:09,970 --> 02:16:13,640
Then the fact that I didn't receive a message from Yong Woo hurt me.

3077
02:16:13,841 --> 02:16:15,171
I was like, "I am disappointed."

3078
02:16:15,570 --> 02:16:18,381
Then I had a moment of clarity.

3079
02:16:18,980 --> 02:16:20,550
I was such a fool.

3080
02:16:20,650 --> 02:16:23,950
I just needed to send a message to the person I was interested in.

3081
02:16:24,050 --> 02:16:27,420
I felt like a fool for worrying about...

3082
02:16:27,421 --> 02:16:28,691
what would be polite.

3083
02:16:29,050 --> 02:16:31,161
And Yong Woo seemed cool.

3084
02:16:31,491 --> 02:16:33,090
That's how much...

3085
02:16:33,091 --> 02:16:36,261
he wants to express his feelings to the woman.

3086
02:16:36,630 --> 02:16:39,730
I thought, "I should do that from now on."

3087
02:16:40,431 --> 02:16:43,770
(No one chose your sibling.)

3088
02:16:43,771 --> 02:16:46,540
My heart became heavy.

3089
02:16:47,111 --> 02:16:50,241
On one hand, I thought it could happen.

3090
02:16:50,640 --> 02:16:53,181
"I am falling too quickly for Jung Sub."

3091
02:16:53,380 --> 02:16:54,880
She probably thought that.

3092
02:16:55,111 --> 02:16:57,049
They had only met recently,

3093
02:16:57,050 --> 02:17:00,091
so he might not have a lot of interest in Se Seung.

3094
02:17:00,251 --> 02:17:03,960
Perhaps Se Seung can be more objective from now on.

3095
02:17:08,790 --> 02:17:14,400
(I hope Jung Sub doesn't snore. If he does, snore more loudly.)

3096
02:17:16,841 --> 02:17:17,869
It's from Yong Woo.

3097
02:17:17,870 --> 02:17:19,101
- Yong Woo. - My goodness.

3098
02:17:19,171 --> 02:17:21,370
- That's incredible. - Did you see that message?

3099
02:17:21,540 --> 02:17:23,910
I think he put her at ease.

3100
02:17:23,911 --> 02:17:26,649
"I understand, so you can be at ease."

3101
02:17:26,650 --> 02:17:28,280
- "I am okay." - "I am okay."

3102
02:17:28,281 --> 02:17:29,281
- "I am okay." - Okay.

3103
02:17:29,281 --> 02:17:30,281
- I can't believe it. - Seriously.

3104
02:17:30,282 --> 02:17:31,350
- Okay. - Yong Woo is cool.

3105
02:17:31,351 --> 02:17:34,290
The message was intense. It was intense.

3106
02:17:34,390 --> 02:17:40,861
(I hope Jung Sub doesn't snore. If he does, snore more loudly.)

3107
02:17:47,700 --> 02:17:49,370
I sent a playful message.

3108
02:17:49,941 --> 02:17:53,840
If it made her smile briefly, I would be happy.

3109
02:17:53,841 --> 02:17:55,111
That was the feeling I had.

3110
02:17:58,241 --> 02:17:59,780
It seemed like a message from Yong Woo.

3111
02:17:59,781 --> 02:18:01,780
He is witty.

3112
02:18:01,781 --> 02:18:03,580
He sent me a message...

3113
02:18:03,581 --> 02:18:05,251
after going on a date with someone else.

3114
02:18:05,351 --> 02:18:07,591
So it touched me more...

3115
02:18:07,851 --> 02:18:09,620
and made me happier.

3116
02:18:09,820 --> 02:18:12,290
As I thought about him while enjoying a date...

3117
02:18:12,390 --> 02:18:13,861
with someone else,

3118
02:18:13,960 --> 02:18:16,399
he thought about me.

3119
02:18:16,400 --> 02:18:17,700
So it made my heart flutter more.

3120
02:18:24,101 --> 02:18:28,011
(Have a good night today as well.)

3121
02:18:28,171 --> 02:18:30,081
I sent it to Yong Woo.

3122
02:18:30,241 --> 02:18:33,351
I thought about him throughout the date.

3123
02:18:33,450 --> 02:18:38,281
"I care a lot about him."

3124
02:18:38,380 --> 02:18:39,790
I had that thought.

3125
02:18:39,950 --> 02:18:43,760
"Have a good night today as well." There was "As well."

3126
02:18:43,761 --> 02:18:46,020
I think we are building...

3127
02:18:46,021 --> 02:18:47,531
an invisible connection now.

3128
02:18:48,060 --> 02:18:49,590
- My goodness. - Gosh.

3129
02:18:49,591 --> 02:18:52,361
- They make my heart flutter. - I am hyperventilating.

3130
02:18:52,531 --> 02:18:54,830
- It's over for them. - It's over.

3131
02:18:54,831 --> 02:18:56,330
This moment made them enter...

3132
02:18:56,331 --> 02:18:57,840
- the new realm. - It's over.

3133
02:18:57,841 --> 02:18:59,440
- As for them... - It's like a secret relationship.

3134
02:18:59,441 --> 02:19:00,511
Their connection became more solid.

3135
02:19:00,870 --> 02:19:03,580
I thought Jung Sub and Se Seung had a strong relationship,

3136
02:19:03,581 --> 02:19:04,879
but it began to crack.

3137
02:19:04,880 --> 02:19:06,479
- Those two never had that problem. - Right.

3138
02:19:06,480 --> 02:19:10,080
If a man goes on a date with another woman...

3139
02:19:10,081 --> 02:19:11,280
That's right.

3140
02:19:11,281 --> 02:19:13,389
And continues sending me a message,

3141
02:19:13,390 --> 02:19:15,149
I wouldn't be able to forget him...

3142
02:19:15,150 --> 02:19:16,389
no matter whom I go on a date with.

3143
02:19:16,390 --> 02:19:17,991
- That's right. - That's right.

3144
02:19:18,161 --> 02:19:20,830
- Yong Woo... - He was popular.

3145
02:19:20,831 --> 02:19:22,191
- He was popular. - He was popular.

3146
02:19:22,290 --> 02:19:23,699
But he refused...

3147
02:19:23,700 --> 02:19:25,330
- all advances... - That's right.

3148
02:19:25,331 --> 02:19:27,230
And stood before her.

3149
02:19:32,900 --> 02:19:36,781
(I had so much fun today. Your smile looks nice.)

3150
02:19:39,751 --> 02:19:41,950
I sent Cho A a message.

3151
02:19:42,181 --> 02:19:44,220
We had a good date.

3152
02:19:45,781 --> 02:19:47,021
Like this.

3153
02:19:47,150 --> 02:19:49,490
- Like this? - She laughed throughout the date.

3154
02:19:49,491 --> 02:19:50,921
You are good.

3155
02:19:51,620 --> 02:19:52,789
That's so funny.

3156
02:19:52,790 --> 02:19:53,790
I know.

3157
02:20:00,501 --> 02:20:05,841
(All messages have been sent. Have a good night.)

3158
02:20:16,450 --> 02:20:17,581
I can't wait.

3159
02:20:27,560 --> 02:20:30,700
I found out when I received, "All messages have been sent."

3160
02:20:31,060 --> 02:20:33,299
I was certain that Cho A would send me...

3161
02:20:33,300 --> 02:20:34,700
a message.

3162
02:20:35,070 --> 02:20:36,970
My certainty crumbled then.

3163
02:20:45,281 --> 02:20:48,550
When it was time to send a message,

3164
02:20:48,650 --> 02:20:52,319
I did think about Jung Sub.

3165
02:20:52,320 --> 02:20:55,649
But it was closer to politeness,

3166
02:20:55,650 --> 02:20:59,219
not a personal interest.

3167
02:20:59,220 --> 02:21:01,430
Each and every message...

3168
02:21:01,431 --> 02:21:04,300
is precious to me.

3169
02:21:04,400 --> 02:21:08,670
I wondered if it would be okay to use it...

3170
02:21:08,671 --> 02:21:10,271
to be polite.

3171
02:21:10,370 --> 02:21:13,241
My heart was already set.

3172
02:21:14,070 --> 02:21:17,039
It's hard to know what the other person is thinking.

3173
02:21:17,040 --> 02:21:18,610
You don't know what's going on inside...

3174
02:21:18,611 --> 02:21:19,781
even if you spend an entire day with them.

3175
02:21:20,281 --> 02:21:22,550
Jung Sub can't school his face.

3176
02:21:22,650 --> 02:21:23,780
Oh, no.

3177
02:21:23,781 --> 02:21:25,549
They will now use the two-person room.

3178
02:21:25,550 --> 02:21:27,921
Oh, no. How will they share the room?

3179
02:21:28,120 --> 02:21:29,351
Oh, no.

3180
02:21:30,021 --> 02:21:32,991
(Two people chose your sibling.)

3181
02:21:33,091 --> 02:21:34,091
She is an ace.

3182
02:21:34,661 --> 02:21:37,530
I think she is becoming prettier.

3183
02:21:37,531 --> 02:21:38,531
Is it the power of love?

3184
02:21:40,630 --> 02:21:43,241
Jung Sub didn't receive a message either.

3185
02:21:43,841 --> 02:21:45,470
I felt his pain.

3186
02:21:46,441 --> 02:21:49,270
Although he spent time with someone,

3187
02:21:49,271 --> 02:21:50,910
he didn't receive a message.

3188
02:21:50,911 --> 02:21:53,111
I know that feeling.

3189
02:21:53,950 --> 02:21:55,710
I could understand even though he didn't say much.

3190
02:21:59,351 --> 02:22:02,021
It made me think about the entire day.

3191
02:22:02,390 --> 02:22:04,091
"Did I do something wrong during the date?"

3192
02:22:04,191 --> 02:22:06,161
"Did I drive too roughly?"

3193
02:22:07,261 --> 02:22:09,491
I felt like...

3194
02:22:09,591 --> 02:22:11,459
the memories of the date were crumbling.

3195
02:22:11,460 --> 02:22:13,869
To find out what was wrong,

3196
02:22:13,870 --> 02:22:16,171
I kept breaking the memories.

3197
02:22:16,271 --> 02:22:17,970
It was very painful.

3198
02:22:20,341 --> 02:22:23,070
I think Se Seung sent a message to Yong Woo.

3199
02:22:23,281 --> 02:22:26,140
She enjoyed the date with him.

3200
02:22:26,310 --> 02:22:29,111
But Cho A didn't.

3201
02:22:29,550 --> 02:22:33,719
Although we had a packed date,

3202
02:22:33,720 --> 02:22:35,389
I didn't get chosen.

3203
02:22:35,390 --> 02:22:37,521
It made me think.

3204
02:22:41,560 --> 02:22:44,630
It started an internal war.

3205
02:22:45,501 --> 02:22:47,400
It was the hardest day for me.

3206
02:22:47,931 --> 02:22:49,671
I don't know if it was because of the zero votes...

3207
02:22:49,771 --> 02:22:52,899
or if it was because I couldn't see Jung Sub...

3208
02:22:52,900 --> 02:22:54,510
all day long.

3209
02:22:54,511 --> 02:22:57,111
Now, he was going to another lodging...

3210
02:22:57,210 --> 02:22:59,040
and I had to spend another day without him.

3211
02:22:59,611 --> 02:23:03,480
It was a draining day in many ways.

3212
02:23:29,911 --> 02:23:32,741
(The second day in Gangwon Province)

3213
02:23:32,880 --> 02:23:36,011
(They enjoy the double dates in two teams.)

3214
02:23:36,111 --> 02:23:37,680
(Good luck!)

3215
02:23:37,681 --> 02:23:38,880
Bye.

3216
02:23:40,021 --> 02:23:41,949
(It was so refreshing and stress-relieving.)

3217
02:23:41,950 --> 02:23:43,521
(- It's fun, right? - It's so fun.)

3218
02:23:45,890 --> 02:23:47,930
(My heart beat so fast.)

3219
02:23:47,931 --> 02:23:51,129
(I became happy again. I was in a good mood again.)

3220
02:23:51,130 --> 02:23:53,101
(I won't forget that feeling.)

3221
02:23:53,130 --> 02:23:55,600
(Cheol Hyeon seems to like Ji Won a lot.)

3222
02:23:55,601 --> 02:23:57,539
(I woke up...)

3223
02:23:57,540 --> 02:23:58,799
(while talking to you.)

3224
02:23:58,800 --> 02:24:00,740
(I took the passenger seat without asking.)

3225
02:24:00,741 --> 02:24:02,870
(I wanted to play around with Jae Hyung...)

3226
02:24:02,970 --> 02:24:05,440
(and have a conversation with him.)

3227
02:24:05,441 --> 02:24:07,681
(Everyone was falling in love.)

3228
02:24:07,781 --> 02:24:10,181
(But not everyone is happy at night.)

3229
02:24:10,351 --> 02:24:13,020
(I felt like things were going offbeat.)

3230
02:24:13,021 --> 02:24:15,190
(I am so tired. The tension suddenly left my body.)

3231
02:24:15,191 --> 02:24:16,860
(I can't ask you to play with me.)

3232
02:24:16,861 --> 02:24:18,619
(I wanted to talk to her...)

3233
02:24:18,620 --> 02:24:20,129
(about what she was thinking.)

3234
02:24:20,130 --> 02:24:21,860
(I don't want to give up.)

3235
02:24:21,861 --> 02:24:23,601
(I don't know if it will be okay.)

3236
02:24:23,800 --> 02:24:26,730
(How will they remember this trip?)
