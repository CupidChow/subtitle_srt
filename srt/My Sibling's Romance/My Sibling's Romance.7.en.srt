1
00:00:00,422 --> 00:00:03,061
(After the date in Gangwon Province, )

2
00:00:03,262 --> 00:00:05,562
(everyone had dinner together.)

3
00:00:06,102 --> 00:00:08,000
(There's Ji Won's sibling, )

4
00:00:08,001 --> 00:00:10,301
(Yun Jae here.)

5
00:00:10,431 --> 00:00:12,770
(The mission was to give a slice of meat...)

6
00:00:12,771 --> 00:00:14,542
(to the person I liked.)

7
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:18,942
(Yun Jae gave heaps of meat to Yun Ha.)

8
00:00:19,181 --> 00:00:24,011
(There are three rooms prepared, a quad room, a triple room, )

9
00:00:24,012 --> 00:00:25,951
(and a double room.)

10
00:00:27,082 --> 00:00:30,020
(Triple room: Ju Yeon, Yun Ha, and Jae Hyung)

11
00:00:30,021 --> 00:00:31,892
(I wanted to avoid the double room.)

12
00:00:34,561 --> 00:00:35,561
(Quad room: Yong Woo and Se Seung, )

13
00:00:35,562 --> 00:00:37,962
(Ji Won and Cheol Hyeon)

14
00:00:39,161 --> 00:00:42,532
(Double room: Jung Sub and Cho A)

15
00:00:43,271 --> 00:00:44,871
(What a pity.)

16
00:00:45,341 --> 00:00:47,201
(Humming)

17
00:00:47,902 --> 00:00:50,271
(I thought, "Nothing would happen.")

18
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:56,411
(All messages have been sent. Have a good night.)

19
00:00:57,252 --> 00:00:59,721
(I was almost certain...)

20
00:00:59,722 --> 00:01:01,251
(that Cho A would text me.)

21
00:01:01,252 --> 00:01:03,692
(That was the moment the confidence crumbled.)

22
00:01:03,851 --> 00:01:07,921
(Although we had a fruitful date, )

23
00:01:07,922 --> 00:01:09,732
(I didn't get chosen.)

24
00:01:10,732 --> 00:01:13,631
(I had an internal war.)

25
00:01:18,702 --> 00:01:19,901
Shall we leave?

26
00:01:21,301 --> 00:01:23,642
I'm quite curious about the room.

27
00:01:24,442 --> 00:01:28,112
(Each team heads to the lodging.)

28
00:01:34,821 --> 00:01:38,321
(Cho A and Jung Sub get on an awkward train to the double room.)

29
00:01:41,261 --> 00:01:43,031
I wonder what the room's like.

30
00:01:43,032 --> 00:01:44,062
Me too.

31
00:01:44,832 --> 00:01:46,031
What to do?

32
00:01:46,032 --> 00:01:48,001
- What to do? - I wonder how he's feeling.

33
00:01:48,002 --> 00:01:49,671
- Embarrassed for sure. - He's embarrassed.

34
00:01:49,672 --> 00:01:53,372
If he makes it obvious, he'll get even more embarrassed.

35
00:01:54,372 --> 00:01:56,342
I wonder what the vibe is like there.

36
00:01:57,141 --> 00:01:59,881
How did we pick the double room?

37
00:02:01,411 --> 00:02:04,451
(He keeps putting on a feigned smile.)

38
00:02:07,881 --> 00:02:08,951
Where is it?

39
00:02:09,722 --> 00:02:11,722
But a double room is...

40
00:02:16,432 --> 00:02:19,201
(His head hurts.)

41
00:02:23,631 --> 00:02:25,472
I thought I was going to suffocate to death.

42
00:02:26,342 --> 00:02:28,140
"How should I act here?"

43
00:02:28,141 --> 00:02:29,871
I keyed in the address on the GPS,

44
00:02:29,872 --> 00:02:31,981
and we had to drive for a long time.

45
00:02:32,212 --> 00:02:33,442
For a really long time.

46
00:02:34,951 --> 00:02:36,552
"Why am I put in such hardship?"

47
00:02:37,481 --> 00:02:40,222
"What should I do? What should I say?"

48
00:02:42,921 --> 00:02:45,062
What should we do?

49
00:02:45,222 --> 00:02:48,291
- About what? - What should we do in the room?

50
00:02:48,891 --> 00:02:50,291
- "What should we do?" - Yes.

51
00:02:50,532 --> 00:02:51,532
About what?

52
00:02:52,002 --> 00:02:53,861
- It's a double room. - Yes.

53
00:02:55,472 --> 00:02:56,671
What should we do?

54
00:02:58,742 --> 00:02:59,971
You're okay with it, right?

55
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:01,771
- Yes, totally. - It's okay, right?

56
00:03:01,772 --> 00:03:03,510
- Of course. - But I'm not sure...

57
00:03:03,511 --> 00:03:04,611
what we should do either.

58
00:03:05,111 --> 00:03:08,041
What does she think of this vibe?

59
00:03:08,182 --> 00:03:09,980
I don't know what to do.

60
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,151
Even though we chose a double room,

61
00:03:12,152 --> 00:03:14,651
Cho A chose someone else.

62
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:18,361
She could've sent me a casual text.

63
00:03:18,722 --> 00:03:21,492
I really drove a lot today.

64
00:03:21,891 --> 00:03:23,961
"Thank you for driving. It must've been tiring."

65
00:03:23,962 --> 00:03:26,630
I would've been fine with just this.

66
00:03:26,631 --> 00:03:29,331
She didn't even do that.

67
00:03:29,802 --> 00:03:32,540
Thank you so much for driving today.

68
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:33,641
No worries.

69
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:35,271
(He wanted to receive that as a message.)

70
00:03:35,272 --> 00:03:36,511
Since the morning.

71
00:03:36,671 --> 00:03:37,841
I'm fine.

72
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:40,011
- Are you okay? - Yes, I am.

73
00:03:41,881 --> 00:03:43,251
Will he give up...

74
00:03:43,252 --> 00:03:46,251
or will he try to turn the tables?

75
00:03:46,252 --> 00:03:47,480
I think he'll get competitive.

76
00:03:47,481 --> 00:03:48,691
I think so too.

77
00:03:48,692 --> 00:03:50,320
Instead of getting competitive, I think...

78
00:03:50,321 --> 00:03:51,760
- Do you think he'll give up? - he'll give up.

79
00:03:51,761 --> 00:03:53,390
- Because he's too disappointed? - Yes.

80
00:03:53,391 --> 00:03:54,721
"We're not meant to be."

81
00:03:54,722 --> 00:03:55,931
- "We're really not meant to be." - "We're not meant to be."

82
00:03:55,932 --> 00:03:57,790
But he has a chance.

83
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,301
Then in that one night,

84
00:03:59,302 --> 00:04:01,130
he might think, "I'll turn the tables."

85
00:04:01,131 --> 00:04:02,871
Of course. That's what I think too.

86
00:04:02,872 --> 00:04:06,542
But based on his current mental state,

87
00:04:06,841 --> 00:04:08,171
I don't think...

88
00:04:08,172 --> 00:04:09,441
- I don't think that will happen. - I don't think...

89
00:04:09,442 --> 00:04:10,710
- he will. Now, he's a bit... - he will become competitive.

90
00:04:10,711 --> 00:04:13,681
And he tries to give the text a lot of meaning.

91
00:04:13,682 --> 00:04:14,682
I think that's the type of person he is.

92
00:04:14,683 --> 00:04:16,580
He doesn't need to be so obsessed with the texts.

93
00:04:16,581 --> 00:04:17,651
Exactly.

94
00:04:20,651 --> 00:04:24,751
Normally, I'm the kind of person to just say it straight away.

95
00:04:24,752 --> 00:04:27,260
But back then, I was trying my best...

96
00:04:27,261 --> 00:04:29,291
to organize the thoughts in my head.

97
00:04:29,292 --> 00:04:32,061
I had a lot on my mind.

98
00:04:32,062 --> 00:04:33,161
I kept thinking about it...

99
00:04:33,162 --> 00:04:34,530
and replayed the date in my head.

100
00:04:34,531 --> 00:04:35,771
I couldn't fall asleep either.

101
00:04:37,002 --> 00:04:39,171
- Aren't you tired? - A bit.

102
00:04:39,172 --> 00:04:40,340
- A bit? - Yes.

103
00:04:40,341 --> 00:04:42,441
You looked like you drank quite a bit just now.

104
00:04:42,442 --> 00:04:43,471
Exactly.

105
00:04:44,412 --> 00:04:45,482
The game.

106
00:04:46,042 --> 00:04:48,511
(While playing a drinking game in the pork belly restaurant)

107
00:04:49,412 --> 00:04:50,811
(One shot)

108
00:04:50,812 --> 00:04:52,220
(Two shots)

109
00:04:52,221 --> 00:04:53,381
(Three shots)

110
00:04:53,922 --> 00:04:56,921
On the way to the room, I was a bit tipsy.

111
00:04:56,922 --> 00:05:00,492
I wanted to sleep.

112
00:05:00,721 --> 00:05:04,731
I thought that I should talk a lot with him when we arrived.

113
00:05:04,732 --> 00:05:07,101
Cho A looked like she wasn't thinking much.

114
00:05:07,102 --> 00:05:08,701
"Bokbunja wine and soda."

115
00:05:09,432 --> 00:05:10,602
"My head hurts."

116
00:05:10,802 --> 00:05:14,172
"I need some sleep." This was how she was.

117
00:05:14,341 --> 00:05:16,911
She almost felt stern.

118
00:05:16,912 --> 00:05:19,112
She looked very indifferent.

119
00:05:20,341 --> 00:05:21,381
Are you sleeping now?

120
00:05:25,352 --> 00:05:26,982
- "Are you sleeping now?" - Oh, dear.

121
00:05:27,422 --> 00:05:29,451
- I'm so sad. - I would give up.

122
00:05:32,692 --> 00:05:34,221
(Are you sleeping now?)

123
00:05:35,391 --> 00:05:36,461
Are you sleeping?

124
00:05:36,992 --> 00:05:38,062
You're sleeping.

125
00:05:49,011 --> 00:05:51,912
(He can't fall asleep.)

126
00:05:53,141 --> 00:05:56,081
(A dark night)

127
00:06:01,151 --> 00:06:02,651
We're almost here.

128
00:06:05,922 --> 00:06:07,692
We must've had a blast.

129
00:06:08,362 --> 00:06:10,261
- Today? - Not today, is it yesterday now?

130
00:06:12,602 --> 00:06:16,102
Cho A, about yesterday's date...

131
00:06:17,102 --> 00:06:20,571
- It wasn't bad, right? - Yes, I liked it.

132
00:06:21,571 --> 00:06:22,971
What about you?

133
00:06:23,771 --> 00:06:24,942
I...

134
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:27,242
- Me? - Yes.

135
00:06:27,511 --> 00:06:29,381
I really liked it.

136
00:06:30,951 --> 00:06:32,482
Which one did you like the most?

137
00:06:32,922 --> 00:06:35,320
Stopping by the service area.

138
00:06:35,321 --> 00:06:37,792
Isn't it the walnut pastry that you liked?

139
00:06:38,492 --> 00:06:40,820
I really liked the service area.

140
00:06:40,821 --> 00:06:42,761
It wasn't in the plan.

141
00:06:43,062 --> 00:06:44,461
I liked it.

142
00:06:45,802 --> 00:06:46,802
Well...

143
00:06:47,802 --> 00:06:48,802
A bit...

144
00:06:49,771 --> 00:06:50,901
I'm a bit...

145
00:06:52,602 --> 00:06:53,971
heartbroken.

146
00:06:57,641 --> 00:07:00,112
I don't know how to wrap it up.

147
00:07:01,412 --> 00:07:02,412
It was nice?

148
00:07:03,182 --> 00:07:04,182
It was nice.

149
00:07:05,122 --> 00:07:07,721
- Exactly. - I really enjoyed the coffee too.

150
00:07:08,021 --> 00:07:10,752
You let me have the crema.

151
00:07:11,352 --> 00:07:14,362
- This is the first coffee of today. - You're right.

152
00:07:15,761 --> 00:07:17,192
The crema's beautiful.

153
00:07:17,292 --> 00:07:20,062
I'll give you the one with the beautiful crema.

154
00:07:20,531 --> 00:07:23,271
(He swapped his coffee with Cho A.)

155
00:07:24,102 --> 00:07:25,840
You really remember everything.

156
00:07:25,841 --> 00:07:27,442
Yes. It was really delicious.

157
00:07:28,742 --> 00:07:31,112
Thank you.

158
00:07:31,711 --> 00:07:33,780
I don't really want...

159
00:07:33,781 --> 00:07:35,151
to give up.

160
00:07:37,482 --> 00:07:39,682
I don't know if I'm allowed to, but...

161
00:07:41,721 --> 00:07:44,591
- So... - I have a question.

162
00:07:45,162 --> 00:07:46,491
- Have you made up your mind? - What?

163
00:07:46,492 --> 00:07:47,492
(Tumbling)

164
00:07:49,062 --> 00:07:52,062
- So... - I have a question.

165
00:07:52,562 --> 00:07:53,801
- Have you made up your mind? - What?

166
00:07:53,802 --> 00:07:54,900
(Tumbling)

167
00:07:54,901 --> 00:07:56,502
Yong Woo must've gotten in secretly.

168
00:07:58,771 --> 00:08:00,201
Yong Woo got in secretly.

169
00:08:01,071 --> 00:08:02,371
"Fix what?"

170
00:08:02,372 --> 00:08:05,442
Seeing how he rustled when he asked, "Is it fixed?"

171
00:08:05,711 --> 00:08:06,811
(Is it fixed?)

172
00:08:06,812 --> 00:08:08,182
(Tumbling)

173
00:08:08,682 --> 00:08:10,612
- What's that? Our baggage? - Gosh.

174
00:08:11,252 --> 00:08:12,281
In the trunk?

175
00:08:13,021 --> 00:08:15,752
- The baggage? - The baggage fell.

176
00:08:16,091 --> 00:08:17,150
They must've been stacked up.

177
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:19,622
They were stacked up. I asked the most important question.

178
00:08:20,162 --> 00:08:21,220
(Tumbling again)

179
00:08:21,221 --> 00:08:22,392
- Which one is it? - What's that?

180
00:08:23,392 --> 00:08:26,132
(Nothing goes as he wants.)

181
00:08:31,172 --> 00:08:32,841
It's not that cold although it's a seaside.

182
00:08:33,902 --> 00:08:36,312
- This is insane. - This is seriously insane.

183
00:08:38,882 --> 00:08:40,182
The sound of the sea is amazing.

184
00:08:41,042 --> 00:08:44,111
- I've never seen a winter sea. - Me either.

185
00:08:46,221 --> 00:08:47,682
One, two, three.

186
00:08:55,932 --> 00:08:58,330
We're really separated.

187
00:08:58,331 --> 00:09:00,262
We're totally separated from other teams for tonight.

188
00:09:00,601 --> 00:09:03,531
Exactly. I thought there would be separate rooms...

189
00:09:03,532 --> 00:09:05,600
joint by a shared living room, right?

190
00:09:05,601 --> 00:09:06,701
- Yes. - Yes.

191
00:09:07,142 --> 00:09:08,241
Exactly.

192
00:09:09,942 --> 00:09:12,681
It would've been fun to go with Cho A too.

193
00:09:12,682 --> 00:09:16,181
But I didn't have that option from the start.

194
00:09:16,182 --> 00:09:18,412
I wasn't curious about the other lodgings.

195
00:09:18,922 --> 00:09:20,321
"What is he doing now?"

196
00:09:23,251 --> 00:09:25,221
- Cheers. - Cheers.

197
00:09:25,922 --> 00:09:27,620
Ji Won, do you sleep well?

198
00:09:27,621 --> 00:09:29,730
Yes, I do,

199
00:09:29,731 --> 00:09:34,200
but for the recent three years, I've just been working...

200
00:09:34,201 --> 00:09:35,601
the whole time.

201
00:09:36,402 --> 00:09:39,171
- You must do what you want to do. - That's right.

202
00:09:39,172 --> 00:09:40,500
That's right.

203
00:09:40,501 --> 00:09:43,541
How long has it been since you started this job?

204
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:46,481
This is my fourth year.

205
00:09:46,642 --> 00:09:49,181
I've always liked...

206
00:09:49,182 --> 00:09:51,011
supporting others.

207
00:09:51,012 --> 00:09:52,450
I think I'm the type of person...

208
00:09:52,451 --> 00:09:55,820
to feel proud of achieving something...

209
00:09:55,821 --> 00:09:58,491
by leading people and thinking hard together.

210
00:10:00,422 --> 00:10:01,792
I need to get some fresh air.

211
00:10:03,932 --> 00:10:06,731
(Cheol Hyeon steps out.)

212
00:10:07,331 --> 00:10:09,601
It will be very pretty here tomorrow morning.

213
00:10:10,231 --> 00:10:11,571
In the morning?

214
00:10:23,111 --> 00:10:26,551
Jebu Island looked pretty from afar too.

215
00:10:26,552 --> 00:10:28,081
We even looked at it from above.

216
00:10:29,991 --> 00:10:31,022
Do you want to go into the water tomorrow?

217
00:10:31,792 --> 00:10:33,191
- Go into the water? - Go into the water.

218
00:10:33,192 --> 00:10:36,461
- Buy sand lance sauce first. - We'll buy sand lance sauce.

219
00:10:36,632 --> 00:10:38,701
One can eat sand lance sauce and one can go into the water.

220
00:10:40,302 --> 00:10:42,631
It would be terrible if you got either of those.

221
00:10:42,632 --> 00:10:44,771
Between sand lance sauce and going into the water?

222
00:10:44,772 --> 00:10:46,240
- Going into the water. - Really?

223
00:10:46,241 --> 00:10:47,271
Yes.

224
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:49,341
- In this weather? - In this weather.

225
00:10:49,912 --> 00:10:51,642
I'll just take a shot of sand lance sauce.

226
00:10:53,081 --> 00:10:54,812
(Struggling)

227
00:10:57,182 --> 00:10:58,882
(Open the door.)

228
00:10:59,081 --> 00:11:00,321
Is the door locked?

229
00:11:01,351 --> 00:11:03,922
- He must not remember the passcode. - Did he forget the passcode?

230
00:11:04,552 --> 00:11:05,991
I would've been just like him.

231
00:11:09,392 --> 00:11:10,892
Yong Woo, go upstairs and sleep.

232
00:11:10,932 --> 00:11:12,601
- What? - Go upstairs and sleep.

233
00:11:14,001 --> 00:11:16,470
- I'll get going. - Okay. Good night.

234
00:11:16,471 --> 00:11:17,902
Good night.

235
00:11:22,111 --> 00:11:24,470
Have you met someone...

236
00:11:24,471 --> 00:11:25,841
that made you let your guard down?

237
00:11:25,942 --> 00:11:28,210
That made me let my guard down?

238
00:11:28,211 --> 00:11:29,551
Not yet.

239
00:11:29,552 --> 00:11:33,221
I do want to meet a boyfriend who can do that.

240
00:11:33,321 --> 00:11:35,950
Actually, I have a very strong defence mechanism...

241
00:11:35,951 --> 00:11:37,792
and I'm good at pretending to be strong.

242
00:11:38,762 --> 00:11:41,262
But I don't want to lose that either.

243
00:11:41,361 --> 00:11:44,931
But I do think that it might be nice to have my boyfriend...

244
00:11:44,932 --> 00:11:46,331
as that one person who can make me do that.

245
00:11:47,432 --> 00:11:49,631
Whenever I dated,

246
00:11:49,632 --> 00:11:52,671
I always met guys that made me want...

247
00:11:52,672 --> 00:11:54,741
to treat them well and take care of them.

248
00:11:55,302 --> 00:11:57,741
Someone who can make me let my guard down?

249
00:11:58,111 --> 00:12:00,081
I don't know if there's anyone who can do that.

250
00:12:01,241 --> 00:12:04,581
I really like having this conversation now.

251
00:12:05,522 --> 00:12:07,182
You're very thoughtful.

252
00:12:07,581 --> 00:12:08,792
Thoughtful?

253
00:12:09,621 --> 00:12:13,061
I wanted to enjoy this moment,

254
00:12:13,062 --> 00:12:15,590
so I think I slept at around 5am.

255
00:12:15,591 --> 00:12:17,131
We talked a lot during that time...

256
00:12:17,132 --> 00:12:18,830
and I discovered a new side of her.

257
00:12:18,831 --> 00:12:21,330
I found out a lot about her that made me think,

258
00:12:21,331 --> 00:12:22,830
"She's a very strong person."

259
00:12:22,831 --> 00:12:24,001
It was a good time.

260
00:12:27,402 --> 00:12:29,341
(Three people head to their lodging.)

261
00:12:30,272 --> 00:12:31,341
(Surprised)

262
00:12:32,012 --> 00:12:33,042
It's really pretty.

263
00:12:34,182 --> 00:12:35,450
It's so pretty.

264
00:12:35,451 --> 00:12:36,812
- It's so nice. - Is this real?

265
00:12:40,481 --> 00:12:41,580
- What's this? - Amazing.

266
00:12:41,581 --> 00:12:42,620
(Jae Hyung, Yun Ha, and Ju Yeon, triple room in Gangwon Province)

267
00:12:42,621 --> 00:12:44,091
It's so pretty.

268
00:12:45,052 --> 00:12:46,461
Is this really our lodging? Gosh.

269
00:12:47,762 --> 00:12:49,461
It's so nice here.

270
00:12:54,062 --> 00:12:55,471
I love it here.

271
00:12:57,272 --> 00:12:58,272
Gosh.

272
00:12:59,172 --> 00:13:01,442
(Looking around the room got him excited.)

273
00:13:01,971 --> 00:13:05,341
- It's linked like this. - I love this.

274
00:13:05,611 --> 00:13:07,512
You guys should sleep here.

275
00:13:07,812 --> 00:13:08,981
- The bed? - Yes.

276
00:13:09,251 --> 00:13:10,681
(Yun Ha and Ju Yeon's room)

277
00:13:10,682 --> 00:13:11,911
Thank you.

278
00:13:11,912 --> 00:13:15,152
(Jae Hyung's room)

279
00:13:15,422 --> 00:13:17,692
- Will we have breakfast? - Breakfast?

280
00:13:18,861 --> 00:13:21,120
But the lodging with two people...

281
00:13:21,121 --> 00:13:24,162
Exactly. I thought of that as soon as I went in.

282
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:27,532
If it's just the two of them,

283
00:13:28,001 --> 00:13:30,302
wouldn't it be awkward?

284
00:13:30,371 --> 00:13:31,871
- I think it'll be awkward. - I think so.

285
00:13:32,142 --> 00:13:33,840
- Right? And... - It's really time for them...

286
00:13:33,841 --> 00:13:35,541
to get to know each other.

287
00:13:35,542 --> 00:13:37,411
They only got to know more about each other today.

288
00:13:37,412 --> 00:13:39,911
But they're in the same lodging.

289
00:13:39,912 --> 00:13:42,110
- Imagine how... - Who got the double room?

290
00:13:42,111 --> 00:13:43,580
Cheol Hyeon and Ji Won?

291
00:13:43,581 --> 00:13:46,320
- No. Jung Sub and Cho A. - Jung Sub and Cho A.

292
00:13:46,321 --> 00:13:48,820
It must be their first date.

293
00:13:48,821 --> 00:13:50,251
I think so too.

294
00:13:50,792 --> 00:13:52,621
Honestly, when I imagine about him...

295
00:13:54,192 --> 00:13:56,331
I didn't want to imagine.

296
00:13:56,491 --> 00:13:58,932
But he didn't get chosen.

297
00:13:59,532 --> 00:14:02,631
(No one chose your sibling.)

298
00:14:02,632 --> 00:14:06,272
(Jung Sub didn't get any message.)

299
00:14:09,642 --> 00:14:12,642
He looked very upset then.

300
00:14:13,912 --> 00:14:17,581
I was worried a lot more about him than myself.

301
00:14:20,451 --> 00:14:21,552
Because I knew that,

302
00:14:21,782 --> 00:14:25,762
I thought, "How uncomfortable must it be?"

303
00:14:25,922 --> 00:14:29,632
(Cho A and Jung Sub, double room in Gangwon Province)

304
00:14:30,932 --> 00:14:32,091
Let's go.

305
00:14:33,402 --> 00:14:35,262
- Okay, finally. - They're here.

306
00:14:35,432 --> 00:14:36,772
The atmosphere feels cold already.

307
00:14:38,132 --> 00:14:39,341
Wait.

308
00:14:40,772 --> 00:14:41,902
Thank you.

309
00:14:43,642 --> 00:14:44,971
I can't wait to see it.

310
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:48,012
Gosh.

311
00:14:48,882 --> 00:14:50,682
(Surprised)

312
00:14:51,512 --> 00:14:52,820
It's so cozy.

313
00:14:52,821 --> 00:14:53,981
Amazing.

314
00:14:55,422 --> 00:14:56,951
It's so pretty.

315
00:14:58,652 --> 00:15:00,392
The rooms are so pretty.

316
00:15:01,121 --> 00:15:02,662
There are many rooms.

317
00:15:02,932 --> 00:15:04,231
- There are many rooms? - Yes.

318
00:15:04,562 --> 00:15:05,731
(Confused)

319
00:15:06,201 --> 00:15:08,131
- You went in to the toilet, right? - Yes.

320
00:15:08,132 --> 00:15:10,101
- What? - It's opened here.

321
00:15:10,731 --> 00:15:12,370
(The second bedroom and the bathroom are linked.)

322
00:15:12,371 --> 00:15:14,070
- This is amazing. - It's so...

323
00:15:14,071 --> 00:15:15,470
- Here. - shocking.

324
00:15:15,471 --> 00:15:17,041
Is there another bathroom besides this?

325
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:19,741
I don't think so, so use this for now.

326
00:15:19,912 --> 00:15:22,481
I'll close everything I can.

327
00:15:24,211 --> 00:15:26,221
(Jung Sub is well-mannered.)

328
00:15:27,121 --> 00:15:29,621
Gosh, it's so pretty.

329
00:15:30,422 --> 00:15:31,921
Since I'm in a double room,

330
00:15:31,922 --> 00:15:34,720
I have no choice but to be with Cho A,

331
00:15:34,721 --> 00:15:38,161
but in the most mentally vulnerable state,

332
00:15:38,162 --> 00:15:41,601
I arrived at the lodging, and it was so pretty.

333
00:15:42,632 --> 00:15:45,432
The lodging was so pretty...

334
00:15:45,672 --> 00:15:47,172
that it made me slightly less stressful.

335
00:15:47,201 --> 00:15:49,171
Gosh, it's so pretty.

336
00:15:49,172 --> 00:15:50,412
It's so comfortable.

337
00:15:51,172 --> 00:15:53,141
I really liked the lodging when I went in.

338
00:15:53,142 --> 00:15:55,710
Firstly, the lodging was very pretty.

339
00:15:55,711 --> 00:15:59,281
Since there were just two of us, I felt very comfortable.

340
00:15:59,282 --> 00:16:02,651
When it was decided for Jung Sub and I to take the double room,

341
00:16:02,652 --> 00:16:04,451
I felt very comfortable mentally.

342
00:16:04,591 --> 00:16:07,491
The space made me feel very comfortable too.

343
00:16:08,121 --> 00:16:09,292
What's this?

344
00:16:10,662 --> 00:16:13,201
(He found a guest book.)

345
00:16:13,601 --> 00:16:16,802
I'm happy because of the sweet ending.

346
00:16:18,532 --> 00:16:21,601
And this is quite fascinating.

347
00:16:23,012 --> 00:16:24,772
- What is that? - A guest book.

348
00:16:25,542 --> 00:16:27,311
People who came here wrote in the guest book,

349
00:16:27,312 --> 00:16:28,512
and they all wrote nice things.

350
00:16:31,451 --> 00:16:33,522
Jung Sub, you're amazing.

351
00:16:33,981 --> 00:16:36,721
You still have the energy left to take pictures?

352
00:16:37,751 --> 00:16:39,062
Are you very tired?

353
00:16:39,262 --> 00:16:41,662
- I'm very sleepy. - Very sleepy.

354
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,961
- I'm sleepy. - Oh, dear.

355
00:16:46,432 --> 00:16:48,831
Oh, dear. What to do with them?

356
00:16:49,302 --> 00:16:51,000
What if Cho A falls asleep again?

357
00:16:51,001 --> 00:16:53,240
I'm so sleepy. I suddenly feel so relaxed.

358
00:16:53,241 --> 00:16:55,342
I can't even ask you to play.

359
00:16:56,112 --> 00:16:57,171
Let's play.

360
00:16:57,172 --> 00:16:59,881
Is there a blanket there?

361
00:16:59,882 --> 00:17:01,511
Do you want a blanket?

362
00:17:02,211 --> 00:17:05,980
When we arrived, I was a bit tipsy,

363
00:17:05,981 --> 00:17:08,881
so I was taking a rest. As for Jung Sub,

364
00:17:08,882 --> 00:17:11,551
it looked like he wanted to spend more time with me.

365
00:17:11,622 --> 00:17:14,091
I wanted to talk with Cho A for a bit...

366
00:17:14,092 --> 00:17:16,260
on what she was thinking about.

367
00:17:16,261 --> 00:17:18,361
I wanted to have a deep conversation with her.

368
00:17:18,362 --> 00:17:20,300
Poor him, he was determined.

369
00:17:20,301 --> 00:17:21,831
- He was, but she's sleeping. - Yes.

370
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:22,971
Catch some sleep.

371
00:17:23,432 --> 00:17:25,201
It's so exhausting to watch.

372
00:17:25,672 --> 00:17:26,872
- It's suffocating. - Gosh.

373
00:17:27,102 --> 00:17:28,201
- This situation... - What?

374
00:17:29,471 --> 00:17:32,171
- I want to know more about you. - I think...

375
00:17:32,172 --> 00:17:33,612
it's because of that.

376
00:17:33,781 --> 00:17:36,210
- Is it Bokbunja wine and soda? - Because of Bokbunja wine and soda?

377
00:17:36,211 --> 00:17:38,980
That thing makes my head hurt a bit.

378
00:17:38,981 --> 00:17:40,582
That makes your head hurt.

379
00:17:41,622 --> 00:17:44,192
(Cho A's hangover's lasting for quite long.)

380
00:17:44,352 --> 00:17:47,092
I want to talk with you, Cho A.

381
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:48,721
With me?

382
00:17:49,432 --> 00:17:50,491
Yes.

383
00:17:50,961 --> 00:17:51,991
Sure.

384
00:17:53,902 --> 00:17:54,902
Let's do that.

385
00:17:55,701 --> 00:17:57,672
Conversations are good.

386
00:17:58,531 --> 00:18:01,200
Back then, I was really tipsy,

387
00:18:01,201 --> 00:18:04,710
so I really wanted to sleep,

388
00:18:04,711 --> 00:18:09,151
so I acted too comfortably as if I was in my home.

389
00:18:09,152 --> 00:18:12,351
Still, I was sharing a room with a guy...

390
00:18:12,352 --> 00:18:14,951
that I had an interest in.

391
00:18:15,322 --> 00:18:17,220
I think sleeping early and waking up early...

392
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:19,361
- the next day... - The next day.

393
00:18:19,362 --> 00:18:20,621
And talking with a clear mind...

394
00:18:20,622 --> 00:18:22,060
- is the wisest thing to do. - Yes.

395
00:18:22,061 --> 00:18:25,030
Jung Sub knows that Cho A actually wants to sleep...

396
00:18:25,031 --> 00:18:26,700
- and is very tired. - Yes.

397
00:18:26,701 --> 00:18:29,371
He thinks that it's better to sleep tonight,

398
00:18:29,372 --> 00:18:30,500
but he also wants to talk to her.

399
00:18:30,501 --> 00:18:32,641
In this situation,

400
00:18:32,642 --> 00:18:35,572
it's better to focus on Cho A's current state.

401
00:18:35,701 --> 00:18:37,411
He should let her sleep now.

402
00:18:37,412 --> 00:18:39,280
And tomorrow, although they have a double date,

403
00:18:39,281 --> 00:18:41,480
they can have some free time if they wake up earlier.

404
00:18:41,481 --> 00:18:43,411
- That's possible. - Yes. Then...

405
00:18:43,412 --> 00:18:45,821
It would be wiser to talk while drinking a warm cup...

406
00:18:45,822 --> 00:18:48,151
- of coffee. - Exactly. Cho A needs to recover.

407
00:18:48,152 --> 00:18:50,451
- He must've been in a hurry. - He doesn't have peace of mind.

408
00:18:53,221 --> 00:18:54,621
Actually,

409
00:18:54,622 --> 00:18:57,191
I feel like I didn't muster up the courage too.

410
00:18:57,192 --> 00:18:59,700
I could've just said it.

411
00:18:59,701 --> 00:19:01,131
She must've hated it so much...

412
00:19:01,132 --> 00:19:03,271
when she was really tired.

413
00:19:04,402 --> 00:19:07,201
"Must he talk now?" She might think this way.

414
00:19:09,572 --> 00:19:11,571
I asked her, "Should I go to a convenience store..."

415
00:19:11,572 --> 00:19:13,411
"and buy something?"

416
00:19:13,412 --> 00:19:15,681
We should buy something to eat lightly.

417
00:19:15,682 --> 00:19:18,481
- Should I buy a sandwich? - That sounds good.

418
00:19:18,811 --> 00:19:21,351
It would be nice to go together.

419
00:19:21,352 --> 00:19:24,851
I think I'm really getting tipsy. I'm feeling dizzy.

420
00:19:24,852 --> 00:19:25,921
Then...

421
00:19:25,922 --> 00:19:28,861
Can you get me the thing that makes you sober?

422
00:19:28,862 --> 00:19:30,362
The hangover medicine? Okay.

423
00:19:30,832 --> 00:19:32,801
- Be careful. - Okay.

424
00:19:33,632 --> 00:19:36,331
So I went to the convenience store on my own.

425
00:19:36,332 --> 00:19:39,902
I thought long and hard about buying a can of beer.

426
00:19:40,142 --> 00:19:42,540
But giving a hangover medicine and a can of beer...

427
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:44,572
to someone who has a headache...

428
00:19:44,971 --> 00:19:47,011
and asking to have a conversation...

429
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:50,480
felt wrong. I thought, "It won't do."

430
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:51,751
I just bought what she wanted.

431
00:19:52,852 --> 00:19:55,721
(When he's back, Cho A is singing a carol.)

432
00:19:56,451 --> 00:19:57,790
- You're back. - Yes.

433
00:19:57,791 --> 00:19:58,791
I see.

434
00:19:58,792 --> 00:20:00,092
I got you the hangover cure.

435
00:20:00,662 --> 00:20:02,261
- Cherry tomatoes, eggs, - Thank you.

436
00:20:02,991 --> 00:20:04,392
- You really bought everything. - and tangerines.

437
00:20:04,561 --> 00:20:05,561
- What's that? - And...

438
00:20:05,562 --> 00:20:07,801
- we can microwave this. - Yes.

439
00:20:08,501 --> 00:20:10,270
- That looks tasty. - We can have that together too.

440
00:20:10,271 --> 00:20:12,101
You wanted to have gukbap today.

441
00:20:12,102 --> 00:20:13,102
Right.

442
00:20:13,942 --> 00:20:14,942
(Sighing)

443
00:20:18,971 --> 00:20:20,442
When I came back with the food,

444
00:20:20,711 --> 00:20:23,182
Cho A's condition seemed to have gotten better.

445
00:20:23,582 --> 00:20:25,111
I got the feeling that she could have a can of beer...

446
00:20:25,112 --> 00:20:26,652
given her improved condition.

447
00:20:26,781 --> 00:20:27,781
On top of that,

448
00:20:28,751 --> 00:20:30,592
I kept getting the feeling that our rhythms were off.

449
00:20:31,451 --> 00:20:33,892
So I wanted to do something about that.

450
00:20:39,801 --> 00:20:43,131
I had to be considerate of Cho A. That was one thing.

451
00:20:43,132 --> 00:20:44,301
But...

452
00:20:44,832 --> 00:20:48,142
I didn't want to force her to have a serious conversation with me.

453
00:20:49,201 --> 00:20:51,241
Even if I tried to be considerate of her,

454
00:20:51,741 --> 00:20:53,741
considering my feelings now...

455
00:20:54,342 --> 00:20:55,842
I mean... "How do I feel right now?"

456
00:20:57,382 --> 00:20:58,711
"I don't want to do that."

457
00:21:00,751 --> 00:21:01,950
He's feeling like that...

458
00:21:01,951 --> 00:21:03,551
because he's trying so hard and wants to do well.

459
00:21:04,092 --> 00:21:05,121
Haven't you experienced this before?

460
00:21:05,122 --> 00:21:08,091
- When you're overly enthusiastic, - Yes.

461
00:21:08,092 --> 00:21:11,290
You end up crossing the line or things don't go as planned.

462
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:14,001
- That could be a cleaner way. - When you actually let go,

463
00:21:14,332 --> 00:21:16,101
- the natural side of you comes out. - You become more natural.

464
00:21:16,102 --> 00:21:17,102
Really?

465
00:21:18,031 --> 00:21:20,902
(Cho A grabs the guest book.)

466
00:21:21,842 --> 00:21:23,372
There was a guest book at the lodging.

467
00:21:23,471 --> 00:21:25,441
I still sent the text message to Yong Woo that day...

468
00:21:25,442 --> 00:21:27,411
when I went on a date with a different guy.

469
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:31,511
Yong Woo must have felt good because he sent me his message too.

470
00:21:31,781 --> 00:21:34,251
But Jung Sub sent me the text message for the first time.

471
00:21:34,521 --> 00:21:36,091
It meant that...

472
00:21:36,092 --> 00:21:38,951
he had a good time with me on our date just like me.

473
00:21:39,092 --> 00:21:41,990
I wanted to remember that, so I wrote on the guest book.

474
00:21:41,991 --> 00:21:43,960
(Today was like a dream. I can't believe I'm here. Oh, my.)

475
00:21:43,961 --> 00:21:45,761
(I don't know how to describe it. I'm ecstatic like I'm in a dream.)

476
00:21:46,332 --> 00:21:47,362
(Flipping)

477
00:21:48,701 --> 00:21:50,501
I wrote on two different pages of the guest book.

478
00:21:50,902 --> 00:21:55,071
There were so many small things Jung Sub did for me on the date.

479
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:57,411
I just listed them.

480
00:21:57,412 --> 00:21:58,911
I numbered them too.

481
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:00,240
(The crema on the coffee, walnut pastries at the rest area, )

482
00:22:00,241 --> 00:22:01,481
(tuna gimbap, convenience store, carol, white T-shirt)

483
00:22:03,352 --> 00:22:05,480
It must be a surreal feeling to have while sharing the space together.

484
00:22:05,481 --> 00:22:06,481
Right.

485
00:22:09,852 --> 00:22:12,922
In a way, it gave me a chance to think about our date.

486
00:22:13,461 --> 00:22:16,162
I felt comfortable around him in every single moment of our date.

487
00:22:16,332 --> 00:22:19,700
I think that was possible because he was considerate of me.

488
00:22:19,701 --> 00:22:21,460
I was able to be myself.

489
00:22:21,461 --> 00:22:22,671
I wasn't nervous.

490
00:22:22,672 --> 00:22:25,102
I didn't have to think about how I should behave.

491
00:22:25,332 --> 00:22:30,240
He made the day completely mine by giving me so many things.

492
00:22:30,241 --> 00:22:32,412
When that crossed my mind, I was more grateful to him.

493
00:22:32,511 --> 00:22:36,051
Right. Jung Sub read what I wrote on the guest book.

494
00:22:36,412 --> 00:22:38,211
(Jung Sub opens the guest book too.)

495
00:22:41,382 --> 00:22:45,192
(He's on the page that showed her gratitude toward Jung Sub.)

496
00:22:46,362 --> 00:22:48,822
(But he fails to see it.)

497
00:22:49,662 --> 00:22:52,931
My energy was completely depleted.

498
00:22:52,932 --> 00:22:55,631
I wanted to go to sleep, but a part of me felt uneasy.

499
00:22:55,632 --> 00:22:58,431
I got the feeling that Jung Sub was waiting for me...

500
00:22:58,432 --> 00:22:59,740
in the living room.

501
00:22:59,741 --> 00:23:02,372
And I also remembered that he wanted to talk to me.

502
00:23:02,842 --> 00:23:04,442
- Jung Sub. - Yes.

503
00:23:04,711 --> 00:23:07,912
I'm sorry. But I'm quite tired. So I'm going to sleep early today.

504
00:23:08,412 --> 00:23:10,711
Let's have breakfast together tomorrow.

505
00:23:10,912 --> 00:23:12,051
Sure. That sounds good.

506
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:13,720
If there's a restaurant that serves...

507
00:23:13,721 --> 00:23:15,582
gukbap around here, would you like to go there?

508
00:23:15,951 --> 00:23:17,591
You said you wanted to have sundaeguk.

509
00:23:17,592 --> 00:23:18,592
I love it.

510
00:23:19,122 --> 00:23:20,392
Should I look it up online then?

511
00:23:20,892 --> 00:23:22,221
Sounds good.

512
00:23:23,192 --> 00:23:25,391
Then should we talk tomorrow morning?

513
00:23:25,392 --> 00:23:26,402
Yes, that sounds good.

514
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:29,230
- Okay. - We have time until 11:30am.

515
00:23:29,231 --> 00:23:31,571
Right. You must be tired. Sleep tight.

516
00:23:31,572 --> 00:23:32,700
You too. Sleep tight.

517
00:23:32,701 --> 00:23:34,372
(She takes a rain check with Jung Sub until tomorrow.)

518
00:23:35,771 --> 00:23:38,011
(And Cho A...)

519
00:23:52,922 --> 00:23:55,422
(felt asleep after looking at the pictures for a while.)

520
00:24:02,261 --> 00:24:05,271
(The morning breaks in Gangwon Province.)

521
00:24:10,872 --> 00:24:13,882
(They're going on a double date today.)

522
00:24:14,811 --> 00:24:16,810
We were invited to the double room...

523
00:24:16,811 --> 00:24:18,011
which we were curious about.

524
00:24:18,251 --> 00:24:21,322
We decided to go on our date after the tour of the house.

525
00:24:21,822 --> 00:24:23,651
(Tomorrow, you will go on a double date as two teams.)

526
00:24:23,652 --> 00:24:24,790
(Team A: 4 people in the quad room)

527
00:24:24,791 --> 00:24:25,922
(Team B: 5 people in the triple and double rooms)

528
00:24:26,092 --> 00:24:29,391
(Team A consists of 4 people in the quad room.)

529
00:24:29,392 --> 00:24:31,260
(Yong Woo, Cheol Hyeon, Ji Won, Se Seung)

530
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:32,631
(Team A will go on a 4-person date.)

531
00:24:32,632 --> 00:24:37,470
(Team B consists of 5 people in the triple and double rooms.)

532
00:24:37,471 --> 00:24:39,071
(Team B will go on a 5-person date.)

533
00:24:39,072 --> 00:24:40,871
(Jae Hyung, Yun Ha, Ju Yeon, Cho A, Jung Sub)

534
00:24:40,872 --> 00:24:42,402
(Jae Hyung, Yun Ha, Ju Yeon, Cho A, Jung Sub)

535
00:24:44,612 --> 00:24:46,341
We spent some time taking pictures.

536
00:24:46,342 --> 00:24:49,310
Then we headed to Jung Sub and Cho A's lodging,

537
00:24:49,311 --> 00:24:50,682
so we could take a look around the house.

538
00:24:53,182 --> 00:24:55,622
(Ju Yeon quickly goes to the passenger seat.)

539
00:25:00,122 --> 00:25:02,561
(She manages to sit next to Jae Hyung.)

540
00:25:07,001 --> 00:25:08,162
- She got the passenger seat. - She got it.

541
00:25:08,932 --> 00:25:10,470
- Good job. - That's how it should be.

542
00:25:10,471 --> 00:25:11,601
- That's the right attitude. - Yes.

543
00:25:11,602 --> 00:25:13,402
- Yun Ha sat in the front yesterday. - Right.

544
00:25:13,501 --> 00:25:14,602
Good job.

545
00:25:15,001 --> 00:25:16,841
(Cho A and Jung Sub's double lodging...)

546
00:25:16,842 --> 00:25:18,672
(in Gangwon Province)

547
00:25:23,112 --> 00:25:25,412
(Jung Sub's alarm goes off at 9am.)

548
00:25:26,981 --> 00:25:28,922
(Then he goes back to sleep.)

549
00:25:29,451 --> 00:25:31,551
(Cho A wakes up at his alarm.)

550
00:25:32,592 --> 00:25:34,461
When I woke up that morning,

551
00:25:34,622 --> 00:25:36,361
I thought Jung Sub would be awake...

552
00:25:36,362 --> 00:25:38,491
because we were going to have gukbap.

553
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:55,311
- He can't seem to wake up. - Oh, no.

554
00:25:55,582 --> 00:25:58,082
I bet he went to sleep late because he couldn't sleep.

555
00:25:58,211 --> 00:25:59,381
- He must've had a lot on his mind. - Right.

556
00:25:59,382 --> 00:26:00,481
- He must've tossed and turned. - Oh, no.

557
00:26:05,092 --> 00:26:06,791
But he didn't wake up.

558
00:26:06,991 --> 00:26:08,622
So I didn't wake him up or anything.

559
00:26:09,521 --> 00:26:10,661
(Jung Sub finally wakes up at 10:30am.)

560
00:26:10,662 --> 00:26:12,431
- Cho A. - Yes.

561
00:26:12,432 --> 00:26:14,261
- Are you up? - Yes.

562
00:26:17,501 --> 00:26:18,770
- I see. - Did you get ready?

563
00:26:18,771 --> 00:26:19,771
Yes.

564
00:26:20,201 --> 00:26:21,902
You got ready pretty early.

565
00:26:22,541 --> 00:26:23,541
But...

566
00:26:24,172 --> 00:26:26,811
- Yes? - we might not have enough time.

567
00:26:27,412 --> 00:26:29,511
But is there a restaurant around here?

568
00:26:29,682 --> 00:26:31,082
We have to drive a bit.

569
00:26:33,922 --> 00:26:36,152
- Things aren't working out. - It's not working out.

570
00:26:37,291 --> 00:26:39,791
I wanted to talk to you yesterday.

571
00:26:40,362 --> 00:26:41,391
I was too tired.

572
00:26:41,392 --> 00:26:43,231
You know, I really wanted to talk to you too.

573
00:26:43,362 --> 00:26:45,291
I really tried my best to stay awake.

574
00:26:45,761 --> 00:26:47,531
- But I was so tired. - Seriously.

575
00:26:48,701 --> 00:26:50,402
- Jung Sub. - Yes.

576
00:26:50,501 --> 00:26:53,672
There's a restaurant that sells hangover soup around here.

577
00:26:53,842 --> 00:26:55,470
- Geumsung Hangover Soup. - I see.

578
00:26:55,471 --> 00:26:57,041
Right. There's one around here.

579
00:26:57,442 --> 00:26:59,682
There are so many good restaurants around here.

580
00:27:01,541 --> 00:27:02,541
I mean...

581
00:27:02,811 --> 00:27:05,211
But it's 11am. It's past 11am now.

582
00:27:05,551 --> 00:27:07,681
Right. I'm just saying that it's a pity we didn't get to go.

583
00:27:07,682 --> 00:27:09,791
Is that so? I feel the same way.

584
00:27:10,221 --> 00:27:12,751
I hope we come back here after our double date.

585
00:27:13,692 --> 00:27:14,991
I'm not sure about Jung Sub now.

586
00:27:15,122 --> 00:27:17,960
I don't know if it's because he's not in a good mood...

587
00:27:17,961 --> 00:27:20,531
or if it's because he really didn't have any time.

588
00:27:20,731 --> 00:27:21,932
I was wondering...

589
00:27:23,271 --> 00:27:24,431
if he was upset at me.

590
00:27:24,432 --> 00:27:26,231
I couldn't stop paying attention to his mood.

591
00:27:26,442 --> 00:27:28,602
In the morning,

592
00:27:28,771 --> 00:27:31,411
I probably walked back and forth a lot around the house.

593
00:27:31,412 --> 00:27:33,511
I had to sort out my thoughts as I moved around.

594
00:27:34,612 --> 00:27:36,240
After sorting out my thoughts,

595
00:27:36,241 --> 00:27:37,551
I felt slightly better.

596
00:27:37,811 --> 00:27:40,021
I'll wash the cherry tomatoes and give them to you.

597
00:27:40,152 --> 00:27:41,551
I was going to do that.

598
00:27:41,652 --> 00:27:43,692
Gosh. Thank you so much.

599
00:27:43,852 --> 00:27:44,892
Coffee.

600
00:27:45,422 --> 00:27:48,061
- Thank you so much. - I made it weak.

601
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:56,701
Great.

602
00:27:56,872 --> 00:27:58,501
- Cho A is nice. - You have a nice smile.

603
00:27:59,531 --> 00:28:01,741
You're the one with a nice smile.

604
00:28:06,072 --> 00:28:07,912
Could you help me with this?

605
00:28:08,082 --> 00:28:09,082
Sure.

606
00:28:09,541 --> 00:28:10,751
(Struggling)

607
00:28:11,211 --> 00:28:12,651
Can I rearrange your stuff inside?

608
00:28:12,652 --> 00:28:14,451
Yes. Maybe, we should.

609
00:28:15,152 --> 00:28:16,321
This should do, right?

610
00:28:16,322 --> 00:28:18,250
By the way, what did you do with the white T-shirt?

611
00:28:18,251 --> 00:28:19,322
The white T-shirt.

612
00:28:20,061 --> 00:28:21,561
I put it aside, so I could give it to you.

613
00:28:22,261 --> 00:28:23,632
(Trailing off)

614
00:28:25,832 --> 00:28:26,832
Here.

615
00:28:28,162 --> 00:28:29,500
- I'll just close this up. - Thank you.

616
00:28:29,501 --> 00:28:30,571
- What? - I'll close it.

617
00:28:30,572 --> 00:28:31,602
Yes, please.

618
00:28:32,172 --> 00:28:35,602
We were all packed up and about to leave.

619
00:28:36,072 --> 00:28:37,741
She didn't give me my white T-shirt.

620
00:28:38,041 --> 00:28:40,011
- We should change. - Yes.

621
00:28:40,481 --> 00:28:43,382
I didn't bring a T-shirt I could change into.

622
00:28:43,612 --> 00:28:46,481
Jung Sub, do you have an extra white T-shirt?

623
00:28:48,182 --> 00:28:49,892
(After checking the smell, )

624
00:28:52,422 --> 00:28:54,322
(he put the T-shirt on Cho A's bed.)

625
00:28:56,932 --> 00:28:58,892
(Cho A had the white T-shirt.)

626
00:29:01,231 --> 00:29:03,531
(She put it aside to return it to Jung Sub.)

627
00:29:06,741 --> 00:29:09,441
My white T-shirt was just on her bed.

628
00:29:09,442 --> 00:29:10,442
So I thought...

629
00:29:11,872 --> 00:29:14,741
that she had no interest in me.

630
00:29:16,882 --> 00:29:18,480
Your feelings toward someone...

631
00:29:18,481 --> 00:29:20,781
are bound to show in small things like that.

632
00:29:21,352 --> 00:29:23,352
Wait. What did I do with my white T-shirt?

633
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:25,491
Oh, I packed it.

634
00:29:27,092 --> 00:29:28,192
I'm all over the place.

635
00:29:28,692 --> 00:29:32,132
I thought that I should look at Cho A from afar...

636
00:29:32,291 --> 00:29:36,261
like a fan at a meet-and-greet of an idol star.

637
00:29:36,672 --> 00:29:38,072
That's how I made up my mind.

638
00:29:39,201 --> 00:29:40,501
Thank you for the T-shirt.

639
00:29:41,102 --> 00:29:43,001
I don't think you wore it.

640
00:29:47,211 --> 00:29:49,311
(Yun Ha, Jae Hyung, and Ju Yeon arrive at the lodging.)

641
00:29:52,412 --> 00:29:54,551
- So this is the place. - It looks nice.

642
00:29:55,352 --> 00:29:56,491
This place is pretty.

643
00:29:59,652 --> 00:30:03,561
Coming.

644
00:30:03,991 --> 00:30:05,092
Delivery.

645
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:06,730
- Gosh. - Hello.

646
00:30:06,731 --> 00:30:08,431
- Welcome. - Sir.

647
00:30:08,432 --> 00:30:09,730
- It was really nice. - Our house was amazing.

648
00:30:09,731 --> 00:30:11,530
- It was really good. - Our house was better.

649
00:30:11,531 --> 00:30:13,270
- It was that good? - Our house was so much better.

650
00:30:13,271 --> 00:30:14,271
No way.

651
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:15,801
- Gosh. - Oh, my.

652
00:30:16,072 --> 00:30:17,211
- Isn't this beautiful? - It's...

653
00:30:17,612 --> 00:30:18,612
Gosh.

654
00:30:19,572 --> 00:30:20,682
- That's it. - Jae Hyung.

655
00:30:21,481 --> 00:30:23,352
- Jae Hyung feels no pain. - Jae Hyung.

656
00:30:24,711 --> 00:30:25,882
Great.

657
00:30:26,112 --> 00:30:28,281
Thank you for coming. The timing was great.

658
00:30:28,422 --> 00:30:29,922
The tension eased now.

659
00:30:30,551 --> 00:30:32,152
- Gosh. - Oh, my.

660
00:30:32,491 --> 00:30:33,662
- Isn't this beautiful? - It's...

661
00:30:34,021 --> 00:30:35,061
Gosh.

662
00:30:35,862 --> 00:30:37,760
- Come here. - Come here.

663
00:30:37,761 --> 00:30:38,932
They're like kids.

664
00:30:40,501 --> 00:30:43,301
When they came over, I felt like I could breathe.

665
00:30:43,501 --> 00:30:45,631
Of all people, my sister was there.

666
00:30:45,632 --> 00:30:47,672
Being able to see my sister...

667
00:30:47,801 --> 00:30:49,101
when I was having a hard time...

668
00:30:49,102 --> 00:30:50,711
made me feel so grateful.

669
00:30:51,011 --> 00:30:53,072
I knew you would want to see it, so we took pictures.

670
00:30:53,382 --> 00:30:55,681
(She brags about her lodging to her brother.)

671
00:30:55,682 --> 00:30:57,781
- It was so beautiful. Seriously. - I...

672
00:30:58,182 --> 00:30:59,882
That's awesome. You guys did a lot of stuff.

673
00:31:00,221 --> 00:31:01,451
Gosh. That's a beautiful picture.

674
00:31:02,281 --> 00:31:04,720
We met up with other participants and talked about what we did.

675
00:31:04,721 --> 00:31:06,491
They did a lot more than I thought.

676
00:31:06,862 --> 00:31:08,621
I was really disappointed.

677
00:31:08,622 --> 00:31:10,632
I should've played better during the drinking games.

678
00:31:11,362 --> 00:31:14,631
Jung Sub said he wanted to talk.

679
00:31:14,632 --> 00:31:17,500
Winning the double room was a great chance...

680
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:18,970
for us to talk.

681
00:31:18,971 --> 00:31:20,072
So it's a pity.

682
00:31:21,271 --> 00:31:22,501
- Do you think you can do it? - Yes.

683
00:31:22,902 --> 00:31:24,010
- Should I lift it for you? - I can do it.

684
00:31:24,011 --> 00:31:25,171
- You can do it? - I can do it.

685
00:31:25,172 --> 00:31:26,172
Okay.

686
00:31:27,011 --> 00:31:28,112
Slowly.

687
00:31:29,412 --> 00:31:32,011
- I'm going to start driving now. - Yes.

688
00:31:32,751 --> 00:31:33,751
Sounds good.

689
00:31:35,182 --> 00:31:38,122
How about driving on the coastal road?

690
00:31:38,322 --> 00:31:39,422
That's a great idea.

691
00:31:40,261 --> 00:31:41,790
(Yong Woo, Se Seung, Cheol Hyeon, and Ji Won)

692
00:31:41,791 --> 00:31:43,460
(The quad room lodging in Gangwon Province)

693
00:31:43,461 --> 00:31:45,991
Everyone, it's 10am.

694
00:31:51,001 --> 00:31:52,072
(Amazed)

695
00:31:53,902 --> 00:31:56,912
Everyone, look at the ocean.

696
00:32:17,761 --> 00:32:19,092
(Exhaling)

697
00:32:22,102 --> 00:32:23,332
He probably can't.

698
00:32:29,001 --> 00:32:31,011
What time are we leaving today?

699
00:32:31,511 --> 00:32:32,541
At 11am.

700
00:32:33,011 --> 00:32:34,741
Around 11am or noon, right?

701
00:32:35,241 --> 00:32:37,081
Yes. I remember it being 11am.

702
00:32:37,082 --> 00:32:38,182
So around 11am or 11:30am?

703
00:32:39,711 --> 00:32:41,481
- Why do you keep delaying it? - So cute.

704
00:32:43,051 --> 00:32:44,491
(So cute)

705
00:32:44,721 --> 00:32:47,220
- So cute. - Hey, cutie.

706
00:32:47,221 --> 00:32:48,291
Good morning.

707
00:32:48,392 --> 00:32:49,862
Did you sleep well, cutie?

708
00:32:50,132 --> 00:32:51,591
Where's Ji Won?

709
00:32:51,592 --> 00:32:53,162
- She's over there. - In the next room?

710
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:58,932
- Look at the ocean. - Yes, it's beautiful.

711
00:32:59,172 --> 00:33:00,201
It's so nice.

712
00:33:01,001 --> 00:33:03,310
(It's beautiful, but he's still sleepy.)

713
00:33:03,311 --> 00:33:04,541
What time did you go to sleep?

714
00:33:05,311 --> 00:33:07,241
- After I went to sleep... - We all went to sleep too.

715
00:33:08,582 --> 00:33:09,612
This is nice.

716
00:33:10,182 --> 00:33:11,251
Wake up.

717
00:33:13,051 --> 00:33:14,981
(The cutie gets up.)

718
00:33:55,822 --> 00:33:57,031
- I dipped my feet in the water. - Hey.

719
00:33:57,032 --> 00:33:58,032
It was fun.

720
00:33:58,362 --> 00:34:00,262
- Was the water cold? - It wasn't that cold.

721
00:34:00,902 --> 00:34:02,901
- Was it cold out there? - It wasn't cold at all.

722
00:34:02,902 --> 00:34:03,902
I love it.

723
00:34:04,271 --> 00:34:06,671
- How much time do you need? - About ten minutes.

724
00:34:06,672 --> 00:34:08,342
I'll go for a walk in front of the house.

725
00:34:08,972 --> 00:34:10,211
I like it

726
00:34:10,541 --> 00:34:13,310
(They can't help but sing a song.)

727
00:34:13,311 --> 00:34:14,411
- About you - About you

728
00:34:15,081 --> 00:34:18,651
(From head to toe)

729
00:34:18,652 --> 00:34:22,581
(Every little thing you do)

730
00:34:34,402 --> 00:34:35,431
Guys.

731
00:34:37,202 --> 00:34:39,001
One, two, three.

732
00:34:43,641 --> 00:34:46,641
I bet these pictures will come out really nicely.

733
00:34:51,581 --> 00:34:53,111
Come on. Keep up.

734
00:34:53,112 --> 00:34:54,851
You guys have such long legs.

735
00:34:58,621 --> 00:35:00,421
I'm stepping in Cheol Hyeon's footsteps.

736
00:35:00,422 --> 00:35:01,422
Same here.

737
00:35:01,592 --> 00:35:02,891
I have big feet, don't I?

738
00:35:22,782 --> 00:35:25,411
Do you want to see the seagulls? They're my friends.

739
00:35:40,561 --> 00:35:42,431
(Obtaining a stick)

740
00:35:43,001 --> 00:35:44,101
Should I assume the push-up position?

741
00:35:45,001 --> 00:35:46,632
- Should I? - Do it right there.

742
00:35:54,181 --> 00:35:55,512
What is he writing? I see.

743
00:35:56,612 --> 00:36:00,952
(Cheol Hyeon, Yong Woo, Ji Won)

744
00:36:02,222 --> 00:36:03,992
I'll write "Se Seung" really big.

745
00:36:06,021 --> 00:36:08,191
(Se)

746
00:36:08,192 --> 00:36:10,091
I'll write "Seung" really big to match "Se."

747
00:36:10,092 --> 00:36:11,561
(Se Seung)

748
00:36:11,862 --> 00:36:12,931
Huge Se Seung.

749
00:36:14,302 --> 00:36:15,701
We're Se Seung and her entourage.

750
00:36:15,702 --> 00:36:17,000
"Se Seung and her entourage?"

751
00:36:17,001 --> 00:36:18,571
(Cheol Hyeon, Yong Woo, Ji Won, Se Seung)

752
00:36:18,572 --> 00:36:19,831
I wrote her name really big.

753
00:36:20,541 --> 00:36:22,902
Come here, everyone. I'll take a picture with our shadows.

754
00:36:23,871 --> 00:36:25,540
I can only see your name.

755
00:36:25,541 --> 00:36:27,242
(Se Seung)

756
00:36:28,041 --> 00:36:29,382
Isn't your name so big?

757
00:36:34,552 --> 00:36:35,922
I was happy again.

758
00:36:36,121 --> 00:36:37,791
It put me in a good mood again.

759
00:36:38,152 --> 00:36:40,261
I thought, "I can just have a good time today."

760
00:36:40,262 --> 00:36:45,191
I'm bound to figure out where this is headed later on.

761
00:36:45,192 --> 00:36:47,032
I thought, "Let's have fun today."

762
00:36:52,231 --> 00:36:53,641
The heart is crooked.

763
00:36:55,442 --> 00:36:58,742
No. I think that's the rye bread we had today.

764
00:36:59,771 --> 00:37:00,981
That's not a heart.

765
00:37:19,992 --> 00:37:22,702
(Cheol Hyeon)

766
00:37:25,731 --> 00:37:27,501
(Ju Yeon)

767
00:37:30,411 --> 00:37:32,811
(Jung Sub)

768
00:37:34,882 --> 00:37:36,382
(Se Seung)

769
00:37:39,652 --> 00:37:41,152
(Cho A)

770
00:37:43,791 --> 00:37:45,652
(Yun Ha)

771
00:37:48,822 --> 00:37:50,291
(Jae Hyung)

772
00:37:53,632 --> 00:37:54,931
(Yong Woo)

773
00:37:59,271 --> 00:38:00,601
(Ji Won)

774
00:38:04,371 --> 00:38:08,581
(My Sibling's Romance)

775
00:38:08,742 --> 00:38:15,181
(Episode 7: I Am Not Alone)

776
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:16,952
Let's go.

777
00:38:17,351 --> 00:38:19,551
- Let's go. - Let's go.

778
00:38:19,552 --> 00:38:21,061
(The double date begins in Gangwon Province.)

779
00:38:23,322 --> 00:38:25,331
The weather is so nice. This is crazy.

780
00:38:26,492 --> 00:38:28,402
Exactly. Why is it so warm today?

781
00:38:28,601 --> 00:38:30,431
Right. How could it be so warm today?

782
00:38:46,811 --> 00:38:49,782
Yangyang is nice.

783
00:38:50,391 --> 00:38:51,620
You can get some sleep.

784
00:38:51,621 --> 00:38:52,851
We still have 15 minutes until we arrive.

785
00:38:54,121 --> 00:38:56,661
(He fell asleep right away.)

786
00:38:59,461 --> 00:39:00,802
He fell asleep right away.

787
00:39:01,101 --> 00:39:03,262
- He went out like a light. - Like someone knocked him out.

788
00:39:04,202 --> 00:39:05,702
He went to sleep right away.

789
00:39:06,231 --> 00:39:09,371
Yong Woo. I got a really nice nap. It was brief, but nice.

790
00:39:10,271 --> 00:39:12,141
(Staring at the film camera)

791
00:39:12,472 --> 00:39:13,742
How many photos can you take with this roll?

792
00:39:13,811 --> 00:39:17,081
I think we could take up to 24 pictures with the roll.

793
00:39:17,311 --> 00:39:18,981
Do you want to guess how many pictures we have left?

794
00:39:19,382 --> 00:39:20,620
The person with the closest guess...

795
00:39:20,621 --> 00:39:22,080
The person with the closest guess...

796
00:39:22,081 --> 00:39:23,551
- will win. - That person will win?

797
00:39:23,552 --> 00:39:25,092
The winner will go bungee jumping.

798
00:39:25,322 --> 00:39:26,322
- What? - Right.

799
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:27,322
The winner will go bungee jumping.

800
00:39:27,922 --> 00:39:29,790
The winner will go bungee jumping?

801
00:39:29,791 --> 00:39:31,731
- Yes. - Should the winner do it?

802
00:39:31,862 --> 00:39:33,362
- What about you, Yong Woo? - Yes.

803
00:39:33,532 --> 00:39:34,930
- Me? - Right. He can't play by default.

804
00:39:34,931 --> 00:39:36,100
No. This isn't fair.

805
00:39:36,101 --> 00:39:38,702
I'll do it with the person whose guess is the farthest.

806
00:39:39,601 --> 00:39:40,671
That solves it, right?

807
00:39:40,672 --> 00:39:43,072
- I took many pictures earlier. - The other side...

808
00:39:43,271 --> 00:39:45,172
How many pictures did we take?

809
00:39:46,311 --> 00:39:47,410
I'll give you five seconds each.

810
00:39:47,411 --> 00:39:48,681
- Se Seung. Five... - Eleven.

811
00:39:48,911 --> 00:39:50,452
- Eleven. - Eighteen.

812
00:39:50,681 --> 00:39:52,581
- Eleven. Eighteen. - Nine.

813
00:39:53,112 --> 00:39:54,322
Eleven, eighteen, and nine.

814
00:39:54,521 --> 00:39:55,681
- The answer is... - We took a lot of pictures.

815
00:39:56,322 --> 00:39:57,351
The answer is...

816
00:39:57,751 --> 00:39:59,192
The number is on the top surface of the camera.

817
00:40:00,092 --> 00:40:02,192
Sir, it's on the top surface. Yes.

818
00:40:04,661 --> 00:40:05,731
Is that 12?

819
00:40:06,891 --> 00:40:08,632
Is it 12?

820
00:40:08,802 --> 00:40:10,600
- That's it? - Give it to me.

821
00:40:10,601 --> 00:40:11,672
(He doesn't want to believe it.)

822
00:40:12,302 --> 00:40:14,472
- It's 11. Goodness. - Oh, dear.

823
00:40:14,742 --> 00:40:16,270
- So I should jump. - It's you.

824
00:40:16,271 --> 00:40:19,370
- Yong Woo and I should jump. - You two can jump.

825
00:40:19,371 --> 00:40:21,180
How about the four of us jump?

826
00:40:21,181 --> 00:40:23,980
Since we're all going, isn't it better to do it together?

827
00:40:23,981 --> 00:40:25,350
When else are you going to do it?

828
00:40:25,351 --> 00:40:27,011
I...

829
00:40:27,012 --> 00:40:28,481
Your dimples got deeper.

830
00:40:30,152 --> 00:40:32,091
I feel like Yong Woo practiced something like this...

831
00:40:32,092 --> 00:40:33,191
for his job.

832
00:40:33,192 --> 00:40:35,492
Like skydiving where he jumps out of a plane.

833
00:40:35,762 --> 00:40:39,060
Well, I haven't jumped off a plane.

834
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:40,460
I've fallen inside a plane, though.

835
00:40:40,461 --> 00:40:42,402
- It fell like this. - I see.

836
00:40:42,961 --> 00:40:45,871
(They can see something suspicious from a distance.)

837
00:40:46,331 --> 00:40:47,342
Hold on.

838
00:40:48,101 --> 00:40:49,172
No way.

839
00:40:49,302 --> 00:40:50,770
What is that?

840
00:40:50,771 --> 00:40:51,871
Is that it?

841
00:40:52,641 --> 00:40:54,711
(Taking a closer look)

842
00:40:56,012 --> 00:40:59,711
I think it's the highest in Korea.

843
00:41:00,211 --> 00:41:03,921
Shall we decide on two jumpers...

844
00:41:03,922 --> 00:41:05,290
fair and square again?

845
00:41:05,291 --> 00:41:07,262
It was decided so fairly earlier.

846
00:41:07,461 --> 00:41:10,020
You gladly said you two would jump.

847
00:41:10,021 --> 00:41:11,560
None of you are stopping me.

848
00:41:11,561 --> 00:41:14,431
Sadly, we can't help it.

849
00:41:15,032 --> 00:41:16,901
(Yong Woo, Se Seung, Cheol Hyeon, and Ji Won)

850
00:41:16,902 --> 00:41:18,731
(At a bungee jumping site in Inje)

851
00:41:22,041 --> 00:41:23,870
- Please drive on the way back. - Of course.

852
00:41:23,871 --> 00:41:25,910
Your legs will be shaky, so I'll drive.

853
00:41:25,911 --> 00:41:28,210
I might be able to hit the brakes and the accelerator ever again.

854
00:41:28,211 --> 00:41:29,242
Ever again?

855
00:41:30,041 --> 00:41:32,181
Oh, dear. The time has come.

856
00:41:33,552 --> 00:41:35,651
- Two of you, right? - No, the four of us.

857
00:41:35,652 --> 00:41:37,922
- Four of you? - No, those two.

858
00:41:38,592 --> 00:41:39,921
- Just the two of us. - Two?

859
00:41:39,922 --> 00:41:41,691
Please read this.

860
00:41:41,692 --> 00:41:43,460
(Signing a waiver related to safety)

861
00:41:43,461 --> 00:41:44,661
Who suggested the game?

862
00:41:45,692 --> 00:41:46,731
- Right? - Yes.

863
00:41:46,961 --> 00:41:50,060
I'll drive well later.

864
00:41:50,061 --> 00:41:51,172
I'll do an amazing job.

865
00:41:51,402 --> 00:41:53,101
- Let's go over there. - Okay.

866
00:41:53,842 --> 00:41:55,140
- Are you scared? - He must be scared.

867
00:41:55,141 --> 00:41:56,802
I think I will be soon.

868
00:41:57,242 --> 00:41:58,242
(Cheol Hyeon is already scared.)

869
00:41:58,243 --> 00:41:59,512
Cheol Hyeon.

870
00:42:00,211 --> 00:42:02,311
- He gave up. - He already gave up.

871
00:42:02,481 --> 00:42:05,152
- I've never done that. - That makes your teeth sensitive.

872
00:42:05,811 --> 00:42:06,910
Have you tried it?

873
00:42:06,911 --> 00:42:08,281
It makes your teeth sensitive more than it scares you.

874
00:42:08,282 --> 00:42:09,480
You can just close your mouth.

875
00:42:09,481 --> 00:42:11,421
I've never seen anyone close their mouth.

876
00:42:11,422 --> 00:42:12,620
It's impossible.

877
00:42:12,621 --> 00:42:13,621
You're right.

878
00:42:13,622 --> 00:42:14,921
- I can imagine. - They scream, so you're right.

879
00:42:14,922 --> 00:42:16,160
I've tried it a few times.

880
00:42:16,161 --> 00:42:17,660
I wasn't that scared.

881
00:42:17,661 --> 00:42:19,460
- It rather made my teeth sensitive. - Really?

882
00:42:19,461 --> 00:42:20,531
That's interesting.

883
00:42:20,532 --> 00:42:22,601
- I couldn't stop moving my legs. - Right.

884
00:42:22,862 --> 00:42:25,201
- I kept going like this. - Have you tried it?

885
00:42:25,202 --> 00:42:26,930
- I tried it once. - That's impressive.

886
00:42:26,931 --> 00:42:28,870
- I couldn't control my legs. - Your legs?

887
00:42:28,871 --> 00:42:30,342
I can't do it.

888
00:42:31,041 --> 00:42:32,711
- Bye. Let's go. - Let's go!

889
00:42:33,141 --> 00:42:36,180
He seems to feel a weight on his shoulders from behind.

890
00:42:36,181 --> 00:42:37,882
- His footsteps are heavy. - He's trudging.

891
00:42:38,251 --> 00:42:40,681
(Going up to the jumping platform)

892
00:42:43,681 --> 00:42:44,751
He's out.

893
00:42:48,561 --> 00:42:49,592
How do I do it?

894
00:42:50,461 --> 00:42:51,492
Do I just go out?

895
00:42:52,132 --> 00:42:54,500
- He's holding on to it. - He can't come out.

896
00:42:54,501 --> 00:42:57,671
In 3, 2, 1.

897
00:42:57,672 --> 00:42:58,771
Bungee.

898
00:43:05,271 --> 00:43:07,012
He didn't even hesitate a bit.

899
00:43:07,311 --> 00:43:08,911
How can he jump like that?

900
00:43:17,391 --> 00:43:18,951
I feel like he'll fall into the water.

901
00:43:18,952 --> 00:43:20,052
I know.

902
00:43:24,132 --> 00:43:25,691
As I went against gravity,

903
00:43:25,692 --> 00:43:27,330
everything became quiet.

904
00:43:27,331 --> 00:43:30,771
I don't think I can forget that feeling.

905
00:43:30,902 --> 00:43:32,202
The bungee jumping was so much fun.

906
00:43:33,302 --> 00:43:35,371
(Coming back while humming)

907
00:43:35,902 --> 00:43:37,442
I didn't know it was this fun.

908
00:43:37,672 --> 00:43:38,672
It's so much fun.

909
00:43:39,911 --> 00:43:41,281
(Now it's Cheol Hyeon's turn.)

910
00:43:41,282 --> 00:43:43,411
- Oh, my. - Goodness.

911
00:43:45,382 --> 00:43:46,581
(Cheol Hyeon jumps.)

912
00:43:49,422 --> 00:43:51,092
He did it right away.

913
00:43:52,422 --> 00:43:54,822
What? What's with them?

914
00:43:54,922 --> 00:43:56,791
- They're good. - How can they jump at once?

915
00:43:57,262 --> 00:43:59,161
He just went down without hesitation.

916
00:43:59,862 --> 00:44:00,961
I think he's crying.

917
00:44:03,601 --> 00:44:05,632
It was terrifying when I was standing up there.

918
00:44:05,902 --> 00:44:07,031
It was thrilling, though.

919
00:44:07,032 --> 00:44:08,802
(After the thrilling bungee jump)

920
00:44:09,702 --> 00:44:12,572
My hair is dishevelled, right?

921
00:44:12,771 --> 00:44:14,511
- Dishevelled? No, it's okay. - How about my bangs?

922
00:44:14,512 --> 00:44:15,541
(Chick is concerned about his hair today again.)

923
00:44:15,641 --> 00:44:17,751
- You mean here in the bangs? - Yes.

924
00:44:19,811 --> 00:44:21,080
I feel proud.

925
00:44:21,081 --> 00:44:22,680
- They gave this to us downstairs. - Right.

926
00:44:22,681 --> 00:44:24,391
They said congratulations.

927
00:44:25,251 --> 00:44:26,822
So, you don't want to jump?

928
00:44:27,021 --> 00:44:29,361
I heard many successful people...

929
00:44:29,362 --> 00:44:31,862
- came here to jump. - I see.

930
00:44:32,431 --> 00:44:34,132
Inje receives good energy from people.

931
00:44:37,101 --> 00:44:39,600
Those two jumped so well...

932
00:44:39,601 --> 00:44:41,501
- It might look easy. - that they might want to do it.

933
00:44:41,802 --> 00:44:43,000
You should try it at least once in your life.

934
00:44:43,001 --> 00:44:45,870
- Yes. It's good to try it once. - At least once.

935
00:44:45,871 --> 00:44:48,612
Se Seung is thinking if she should do it.

936
00:44:48,782 --> 00:44:50,710
You don't get this chance every day.

937
00:44:50,711 --> 00:44:52,881
This is the highest bungee jump.

938
00:44:52,882 --> 00:44:53,882
People even come for this from Jeju.

939
00:44:53,883 --> 00:44:56,121
- It's the highest in Korea. - They even come from overseas.

940
00:44:56,322 --> 00:44:57,691
I suddenly started to wonder...

941
00:44:57,692 --> 00:44:59,421
if I would have regrets.

942
00:44:59,422 --> 00:45:01,262
Then my heart started to pound.

943
00:45:01,621 --> 00:45:03,492
When I think of something, I tend to act on it.

944
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:05,330
Knowing myself,

945
00:45:05,331 --> 00:45:07,161
I thought, "I might do it. What should I do?"

946
00:45:07,331 --> 00:45:10,731
How high does it feel up there?

947
00:45:10,831 --> 00:45:12,830
- It doesn't feel that high. - It's not that high.

948
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:16,101
You know we have a bunk bed in the house.

949
00:45:16,302 --> 00:45:18,041
- It's as high as that. - It was as high as the top bunk.

950
00:45:19,211 --> 00:45:20,910
But you were holding on to the handles.

951
00:45:20,911 --> 00:45:23,041
Where? The ones behind me?

952
00:45:23,942 --> 00:45:25,052
Should I try it?

953
00:45:25,251 --> 00:45:27,011
- Go ahead. Really. - For real?

954
00:45:27,012 --> 00:45:29,451
I might not do it ever again if I don't do it now.

955
00:45:29,452 --> 00:45:32,322
Looking up from down there, it seemed doable.

956
00:45:32,452 --> 00:45:33,521
So I went up.

957
00:45:34,791 --> 00:45:35,862
Let's go.

958
00:45:35,961 --> 00:45:38,391
(Se Seung will try bungee jumping.)

959
00:45:39,532 --> 00:45:40,532
Gosh!

960
00:45:43,132 --> 00:45:46,202
She gets on the elevator briskly.

961
00:45:46,572 --> 00:45:48,441
Go out this way slowly.

962
00:45:48,442 --> 00:45:49,442
Wait.

963
00:45:53,711 --> 00:45:54,811
Why did I do it?

964
00:45:55,442 --> 00:45:58,181
It started when the door opened.

965
00:45:58,351 --> 00:45:59,681
I started to feel terrified.

966
00:46:01,181 --> 00:46:03,922
I was like, "Was I out of my mind?"

967
00:46:04,692 --> 00:46:07,692
What do I do? I shouldn't have come up here.

968
00:46:08,822 --> 00:46:09,862
No.

969
00:46:11,791 --> 00:46:14,060
- Shall we cheer for her? - One, two, three.

970
00:46:14,061 --> 00:46:15,831
- Go, Se Seung. - Go, Se Seung.

971
00:46:19,101 --> 00:46:21,541
They cheered for me outside.

972
00:46:22,402 --> 00:46:24,141
I thought I should go out.

973
00:46:24,811 --> 00:46:27,842
(Going out bravely)

974
00:46:27,911 --> 00:46:29,782
- She's going to jump. - She'll jump.

975
00:46:30,711 --> 00:46:31,751
Hold on.

976
00:46:33,211 --> 00:46:35,481
Seriously, I shouldn't have come up.

977
00:46:37,121 --> 00:46:38,790
You have two options.

978
00:46:38,791 --> 00:46:41,591
You can jump or give up and go down.

979
00:46:41,592 --> 00:46:42,620
She will do it.

980
00:46:42,621 --> 00:46:44,160
- I don't think so. - I don't think she can jump.

981
00:46:44,161 --> 00:46:45,762
- She might do it. - She will go down.

982
00:46:45,862 --> 00:46:47,361
You should do it at once.

983
00:46:47,362 --> 00:46:48,762
(Mustering up the courage again)

984
00:46:49,032 --> 00:46:50,131
She's out.

985
00:46:50,132 --> 00:46:51,731
It's okay. You can jump.

986
00:46:52,101 --> 00:46:53,501
I feel more nervous than when I had to jump.

987
00:46:55,242 --> 00:46:56,500
Shall we say, "Go, Se Seung" again?

988
00:46:56,501 --> 00:46:58,411
- Go, Se Seung! - Go, Se Seung!

989
00:47:01,181 --> 00:47:02,711
(All thanks to the cheers, she lets go of her hands first.)

990
00:47:02,981 --> 00:47:05,581
In 3, 2, 1.

991
00:47:17,561 --> 00:47:18,730
That's amazing!

992
00:47:18,731 --> 00:47:20,031
Oh, my.

993
00:47:20,032 --> 00:47:22,060
- Just like MIYEON! - I told you. It just happens.

994
00:47:22,061 --> 00:47:25,202
- You're right! It's true. - Her legs are moving.

995
00:47:25,672 --> 00:47:27,902
(Her cute jump makes them laugh.)

996
00:47:28,702 --> 00:47:31,172
Stop!

997
00:47:38,481 --> 00:47:39,512
I cried.

998
00:47:40,112 --> 00:47:41,222
I thought, "I did it."

999
00:47:41,751 --> 00:47:43,681
"I want to text myself today."

1000
00:47:46,351 --> 00:47:48,060
- That was cool. - It was great.

1001
00:47:48,061 --> 00:47:49,222
Se Seung.

1002
00:47:49,422 --> 00:47:52,331
You said it wasn't scary when it went back up.

1003
00:47:52,961 --> 00:47:55,262
- You'd feel so proud later. - Whatever.

1004
00:47:55,461 --> 00:47:57,161
- Let's take a photo together. - Brag about it to your dad.

1005
00:47:59,302 --> 00:48:00,302
Yes. Show it.

1006
00:48:00,472 --> 00:48:01,671
As if I jumped.

1007
00:48:01,672 --> 00:48:03,141
Right. Like you jumped.

1008
00:48:03,771 --> 00:48:05,342
- Okay. - Okay.

1009
00:48:06,811 --> 00:48:07,980
(Watching a video they took)

1010
00:48:07,981 --> 00:48:09,242
It's cool, right?

1011
00:48:12,052 --> 00:48:13,052
(Screaming)

1012
00:48:16,251 --> 00:48:19,251
Mom!

1013
00:48:20,052 --> 00:48:21,661
- Are you nervous? - I'm nervous.

1014
00:48:22,461 --> 00:48:23,592
- Are you? - I am.

1015
00:48:24,461 --> 00:48:25,831
Zipline must be fun.

1016
00:48:26,362 --> 00:48:27,632
I've never tried it.

1017
00:48:28,661 --> 00:48:30,972
Shall we go take the train in the woods first?

1018
00:48:31,831 --> 00:48:32,871
It should be fun.

1019
00:48:33,831 --> 00:48:34,902
It must be cute.

1020
00:48:35,641 --> 00:48:37,571
- Hello. - It looks easy.

1021
00:48:37,572 --> 00:48:39,112
I'm excited for some reason.

1022
00:48:39,911 --> 00:48:41,041
Seriously.

1023
00:48:43,581 --> 00:48:46,211
(Getting off to the zipline boarding area)

1024
00:48:46,512 --> 00:48:48,222
I feel like I'm on a ride.

1025
00:48:48,521 --> 00:48:50,580
It feels like a roller coaster.

1026
00:48:50,581 --> 00:48:51,652
I'm excited.

1027
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:54,992
(My goodness)

1028
00:48:57,222 --> 00:48:58,491
I'm scared.

1029
00:48:58,492 --> 00:49:00,192
- Wait. - It's too high.

1030
00:49:02,362 --> 00:49:04,161
It's going up.

1031
00:49:05,231 --> 00:49:07,202
This is fun.

1032
00:49:07,902 --> 00:49:08,972
Oh, dear.

1033
00:49:09,501 --> 00:49:10,501
I can see the sea.

1034
00:49:11,711 --> 00:49:12,841
My gosh.

1035
00:49:12,842 --> 00:49:14,711
- Be careful. - Here...

1036
00:49:15,842 --> 00:49:16,911
Come on.

1037
00:49:24,021 --> 00:49:25,322
It's fun.

1038
00:49:25,822 --> 00:49:26,922
We'll try this?

1039
00:49:27,121 --> 00:49:28,261
(Arriving at the zipline platform)

1040
00:49:28,262 --> 00:49:29,322
It's so beautiful.

1041
00:49:33,391 --> 00:49:35,830
It's higher and longer than I thought.

1042
00:49:35,831 --> 00:49:37,461
Can we actually do this?

1043
00:49:37,902 --> 00:49:39,330
It's stunning.

1044
00:49:39,331 --> 00:49:41,302
- Right? The mountains. - The mountains look amazing.

1045
00:49:42,842 --> 00:49:44,711
- It should be fun. - I'm a little afraid.

1046
00:49:47,311 --> 00:49:49,511
- Let's take a selfie here. - Yes!

1047
00:49:49,512 --> 00:49:50,581
That sounds good.

1048
00:49:59,492 --> 00:50:00,791
I'm more nervous than I thought.

1049
00:50:01,661 --> 00:50:03,591
- You can do it. - Good luck.

1050
00:50:03,592 --> 00:50:06,262
It's safer if you keep your knees straight.

1051
00:50:06,431 --> 00:50:08,501
- Here we go. - I'm taking off.

1052
00:50:08,831 --> 00:50:09,861
That scared me.

1053
00:50:09,862 --> 00:50:10,931
Bye.

1054
00:50:12,672 --> 00:50:14,572
- Here we go. Let go of your hands. - Okay.

1055
00:50:14,871 --> 00:50:16,742
- Here we go. Let go of your hands. - Okay.

1056
00:50:18,942 --> 00:50:20,540
He said he wasn't scared,

1057
00:50:20,541 --> 00:50:22,281
and he couldn't wait to try it.

1058
00:50:22,282 --> 00:50:25,351
He was holding out, trembling, without taking off.

1059
00:50:25,612 --> 00:50:26,952
I didn't do that, though.

1060
00:50:28,351 --> 00:50:29,680
I wasn't scared at all.

1061
00:50:29,681 --> 00:50:31,552
I didn't let go for a little while,

1062
00:50:31,652 --> 00:50:34,291
but I only did it because I was standing by.

1063
00:50:34,822 --> 00:50:36,621
It wasn't because I was scared.

1064
00:50:37,661 --> 00:50:39,461
- Here we go. Let go of your hands. - Okay.

1065
00:50:40,592 --> 00:50:41,601
(Screaming)

1066
00:50:46,601 --> 00:50:48,902
- It looks fun. - Yes!

1067
00:50:50,572 --> 00:50:51,711
It's incredible.

1068
00:50:58,681 --> 00:50:59,781
It was so much fun.

1069
00:50:59,782 --> 00:51:01,520
I kept screaming while going down.

1070
00:51:01,521 --> 00:51:03,721
It was so liberating and stress-relieving.

1071
00:51:03,722 --> 00:51:04,922
It looks fun.

1072
00:51:07,862 --> 00:51:08,891
Good luck.

1073
00:51:10,891 --> 00:51:11,992
Are you nervous?

1074
00:51:12,692 --> 00:51:14,060
Hold this the same way.

1075
00:51:14,061 --> 00:51:15,601
(Grabbing)

1076
00:51:16,431 --> 00:51:18,230
You don't have to grab it too tightly.

1077
00:51:18,231 --> 00:51:19,302
Okay.

1078
00:51:19,702 --> 00:51:21,801
The zipline looked endless,

1079
00:51:21,802 --> 00:51:23,702
so I was a little scared.

1080
00:51:26,811 --> 00:51:30,281
- Go down like this. - Jae Hyung looks so pale now.

1081
00:51:30,282 --> 00:51:31,381
That's good.

1082
00:51:31,382 --> 00:51:32,710
- Go all the way down like this. - Bye.

1083
00:51:32,711 --> 00:51:34,581
- Goodbye. - Bye.

1084
00:51:40,322 --> 00:51:41,492
Now it hits me.

1085
00:51:46,831 --> 00:51:48,430
He's going a lot faster.

1086
00:51:48,431 --> 00:51:49,862
Yes. Faster than earlier.

1087
00:51:58,141 --> 00:51:59,942
(Sighing)

1088
00:52:00,271 --> 00:52:02,282
You seem a little out of it.

1089
00:52:09,152 --> 00:52:10,452
This is fun!

1090
00:52:23,161 --> 00:52:24,671
- It's fun. - It is, right?

1091
00:52:24,672 --> 00:52:26,201
- That was fun. - Wasn't it?

1092
00:52:26,202 --> 00:52:27,270
It was so much fun.

1093
00:52:27,271 --> 00:52:28,370
The view was stunning.

1094
00:52:28,371 --> 00:52:29,971
- Right. - It relieved my stress.

1095
00:52:29,972 --> 00:52:32,211
- The sunset was beautiful. - I loved it.

1096
00:52:35,942 --> 00:52:39,381
(Please move to the location below. Seongdeok-ro.)

1097
00:52:39,382 --> 00:52:40,882
We're going to a café.

1098
00:52:41,322 --> 00:52:43,581
- A café? - Take a nap, everyone.

1099
00:52:44,322 --> 00:52:45,891
(Setting up the rear-view mirror)

1100
00:52:46,092 --> 00:52:47,422
I should raise this.

1101
00:52:47,922 --> 00:52:48,922
Why?

1102
00:52:49,391 --> 00:52:51,532
Your eyes make me uncomfortable.

1103
00:52:55,161 --> 00:52:56,231
Ji Won.

1104
00:52:58,172 --> 00:52:59,302
That's scary.

1105
00:52:59,601 --> 00:53:00,672
I'm trying to see you in any way.

1106
00:53:03,342 --> 00:53:05,512
- Aren't you sleepy? - I'm okay.

1107
00:53:06,411 --> 00:53:08,580
- Take a nap. - No.

1108
00:53:08,581 --> 00:53:10,281
- Why not? - What?

1109
00:53:10,282 --> 00:53:11,351
- Why? - No.

1110
00:53:13,711 --> 00:53:15,282
She was a good driver.

1111
00:53:15,382 --> 00:53:16,781
She drove so smoothly.

1112
00:53:16,782 --> 00:53:19,422
I almost thought she was older than me.

1113
00:53:20,992 --> 00:53:22,691
- You can sleep. - No.

1114
00:53:22,692 --> 00:53:23,822
You'll be bored.

1115
00:53:26,032 --> 00:53:27,691
He slept when Yong Woo was driving.

1116
00:53:27,692 --> 00:53:28,761
Why isn't he sleeping now?

1117
00:53:28,762 --> 00:53:30,330
Cheol Hyeon is into her.

1118
00:53:30,331 --> 00:53:32,032
- Right. - He's into Ji Won.

1119
00:53:32,331 --> 00:53:34,072
What do you usually think about when you drive?

1120
00:53:34,771 --> 00:53:35,841
When I drive?

1121
00:53:35,842 --> 00:53:38,270
Do you go for a drive for no reason sometimes?

1122
00:53:38,271 --> 00:53:39,370
Japan is really nice.

1123
00:53:39,371 --> 00:53:40,811
Have you been to Kyoto?

1124
00:53:41,612 --> 00:53:42,680
(Ji Won wants to chew gum.)

1125
00:53:42,681 --> 00:53:43,681
- Do you want gum? - Yes.

1126
00:53:44,552 --> 00:53:45,612
Which flavour?

1127
00:53:45,782 --> 00:53:48,151
Anything but pink.

1128
00:53:48,152 --> 00:53:50,581
- There are pink, green, and yellow. - Green.

1129
00:53:50,882 --> 00:53:51,922
Oh, dear.

1130
00:53:55,391 --> 00:53:56,461
Thanks.

1131
00:53:56,521 --> 00:53:58,461
- Green is apple-flavoured. - Mine is lemon-flavoured.

1132
00:54:00,291 --> 00:54:03,161
We kept talking until we arrived.

1133
00:54:03,461 --> 00:54:07,301
I wanted to keep asking her questions.

1134
00:54:07,302 --> 00:54:08,342
I had a good time.

1135
00:54:09,302 --> 00:54:12,371
Cheol Hyeon seemed really into Ji Won.

1136
00:54:12,572 --> 00:54:14,071
When Yong Woo was driving,

1137
00:54:14,072 --> 00:54:16,112
he slept like a baby next to him.

1138
00:54:16,342 --> 00:54:18,580
But when Ji Won was the driver,

1139
00:54:18,581 --> 00:54:21,421
he kept talking to her for hours.

1140
00:54:21,422 --> 00:54:23,652
I thought he was totally in love.

1141
00:54:24,322 --> 00:54:26,552
We're almost there.

1142
00:54:26,822 --> 00:54:28,191
It must be here.

1143
00:54:28,192 --> 00:54:29,592
Thanks for driving.

1144
00:54:29,692 --> 00:54:31,291
- It's okay. - Thanks for driving.

1145
00:54:33,992 --> 00:54:36,262
It seems like we're the first ones to arrive.

1146
00:54:38,202 --> 00:54:39,231
Is it just us here?

1147
00:54:40,632 --> 00:54:42,802
Goodness. It's beautiful.

1148
00:54:45,141 --> 00:54:46,242
Oh, my.

1149
00:54:47,172 --> 00:54:48,811
- Look at the vinyl records. - I know.

1150
00:54:49,612 --> 00:54:51,141
We love vinyl records.

1151
00:54:52,981 --> 00:54:54,620
This place is so nice.

1152
00:54:54,621 --> 00:54:55,681
It is.

1153
00:54:56,882 --> 00:54:58,192
I didn't know about this place.

1154
00:54:59,222 --> 00:55:00,452
I love places like this.

1155
00:55:01,152 --> 00:55:02,621
I've never been to a place with this atmosphere.

1156
00:55:04,561 --> 00:55:06,931
- Who are these? - Who are these?

1157
00:55:07,592 --> 00:55:08,632
Welcome.

1158
00:55:13,771 --> 00:55:17,140
Let's order boneless chicken and French fries first.

1159
00:55:17,141 --> 00:55:19,472
- That sounds great. - And grilled sausages.

1160
00:55:22,112 --> 00:55:24,751
- Did you have fun? - Yes. We went ziplining.

1161
00:55:24,882 --> 00:55:27,052
That sounds fun. We went bungee jumping.

1162
00:55:27,211 --> 00:55:28,951
- You did? - For real?

1163
00:55:28,952 --> 00:55:30,052
- Who did it? - That's awesome.

1164
00:55:30,521 --> 00:55:32,890
- Everyone did it but me. - I did it.

1165
00:55:32,891 --> 00:55:33,951
Se Seung did it.

1166
00:55:33,952 --> 00:55:36,020
Se Seung, you're amazing.

1167
00:55:36,021 --> 00:55:37,322
Se Seung did a great job.

1168
00:55:37,621 --> 00:55:38,991
- What's going on? - Really?

1169
00:55:38,992 --> 00:55:40,532
- What's going on? - Really?

1170
00:55:40,692 --> 00:55:41,701
Hold on.

1171
00:55:41,702 --> 00:55:43,730
- Don't do this. - For real?

1172
00:55:43,731 --> 00:55:45,401
- What's happening? - No way.

1173
00:55:45,402 --> 00:55:46,471
Look this way.

1174
00:55:46,472 --> 00:55:48,942
Ma'am, come close, this way.

1175
00:55:49,371 --> 00:55:51,071
- Where? - Here.

1176
00:55:51,072 --> 00:55:52,342
- Oh, dear. - Goodness.

1177
00:55:52,771 --> 00:55:54,411
- Here. - Oh, dear.

1178
00:55:59,411 --> 00:56:00,810
That's so cute.

1179
00:56:00,811 --> 00:56:01,851
Look.

1180
00:56:02,822 --> 00:56:03,882
Can he talk?

1181
00:56:04,581 --> 00:56:06,091
- Son? - No, he can't.

1182
00:56:06,092 --> 00:56:07,092
What are you doing?

1183
00:56:07,093 --> 00:56:08,221
- What are you looking at? - He's only three months old.

1184
00:56:08,222 --> 00:56:09,361
Look here.

1185
00:56:09,362 --> 00:56:11,632
Look at Dad.

1186
00:56:12,192 --> 00:56:14,092
Son.

1187
00:56:14,331 --> 00:56:16,402
You grabbed my hand again.

1188
00:56:33,911 --> 00:56:35,552
How exciting.

1189
00:56:35,922 --> 00:56:37,882
It's fun.

1190
00:56:38,152 --> 00:56:40,722
Look at Dad.

1191
00:56:41,192 --> 00:56:42,862
"Dad, what are you doing?"

1192
00:56:45,862 --> 00:56:48,632
Mom will help you.

1193
00:56:48,902 --> 00:56:50,762
Jae Hyung.

1194
00:56:51,001 --> 00:56:52,472
"I'm Superman!"

1195
00:57:02,242 --> 00:57:04,141
Turn around and come to Mom.

1196
00:57:05,052 --> 00:57:06,552
There you go.

1197
00:57:07,411 --> 00:57:11,020
Let me ride a scooter.

1198
00:57:11,021 --> 00:57:12,221
Okay.

1199
00:57:12,222 --> 00:57:14,222
Let's ride the scooter now.

1200
00:57:14,791 --> 00:57:15,862
You're cute.

1201
00:57:16,362 --> 00:57:17,692
Mom!

1202
00:57:18,492 --> 00:57:19,930
Looking at the photo,

1203
00:57:19,931 --> 00:57:23,061
I can tell I got a lot older.

1204
00:57:28,371 --> 00:57:30,442
Mom aged a lot.

1205
00:57:32,342 --> 00:57:34,981
Stop. There's not much battery left.

1206
00:57:36,242 --> 00:57:38,080
Once again.

1207
00:57:38,081 --> 00:57:39,181
One last time.

1208
00:57:48,561 --> 00:57:49,592
My son and daughter!

1209
00:57:50,492 --> 00:57:54,532
This is an experience that doesn't come by often in life.

1210
00:57:54,831 --> 00:57:58,771
Take this opportunity to feel it all carefully.

1211
00:57:58,972 --> 00:58:00,802
Your ideal type, the reality,

1212
00:58:01,001 --> 00:58:03,271
and how you're feeling about all this.

1213
00:58:03,472 --> 00:58:06,710
The most important thing is your health.

1214
00:58:06,711 --> 00:58:09,040
You should stay healthy.

1215
00:58:09,041 --> 00:58:11,080
Once you feel like someone is the one,

1216
00:58:11,081 --> 00:58:13,410
just go for them like a go-getter.

1217
00:58:13,411 --> 00:58:14,451
That's what I think.

1218
00:58:14,452 --> 00:58:16,620
I always believed in you.

1219
00:58:16,621 --> 00:58:19,421
Thank you for doing so well.

1220
00:58:19,422 --> 00:58:21,821
This can be a great opportunity,

1221
00:58:21,822 --> 00:58:23,161
so do your best.

1222
00:58:23,422 --> 00:58:25,460
Take a break from your everyday life...

1223
00:58:25,461 --> 00:58:26,560
and try to find a good person.

1224
00:58:26,561 --> 00:58:29,202
Especially, bring a pretty girlfriend.

1225
00:58:31,101 --> 00:58:32,631
The crew is working hard for you,

1226
00:58:32,632 --> 00:58:35,870
so always be respectful and considerate of them.

1227
00:58:35,871 --> 00:58:38,242
Treat them with love. That's all.

1228
00:58:43,112 --> 00:58:44,882
It was supposed to be words of support.

1229
00:58:45,452 --> 00:58:47,112
- "Treat them with love." - Goodness.

1230
00:58:47,351 --> 00:58:50,651
He also did this at our son's first birthday party.

1231
00:58:50,652 --> 00:58:53,221
He was giving a speech at his first birthday party.

1232
00:58:53,222 --> 00:58:55,521
He should've wished him good health,

1233
00:58:55,661 --> 00:58:57,822
but he talked about Samsung Life Insurance.

1234
00:59:01,461 --> 00:59:03,001
(All the siblings will be revealed soon.)

1235
00:59:05,101 --> 00:59:06,101
It's awesome.

1236
00:59:08,902 --> 00:59:10,501
The time finally has come.

1237
00:59:10,601 --> 00:59:12,741
I don't have to hide it anymore.

1238
00:59:12,742 --> 00:59:14,882
They must have figured it out from our faces, though.

1239
00:59:15,711 --> 00:59:16,911
I felt lighter.

1240
00:59:17,641 --> 00:59:19,481
It should be fun when it's all revealed.

1241
00:59:20,282 --> 00:59:22,381
I've been waiting for this moment.

1242
00:59:22,382 --> 00:59:25,422
I thought I could even feel closer to the other participants.

1243
00:59:27,552 --> 00:59:28,591
(All the siblings will be revealed soon.)

1244
00:59:28,592 --> 00:59:32,132
(Congratulations.)

1245
00:59:32,762 --> 00:59:35,500
Jung Sub, there's Dad.

1246
00:59:35,501 --> 00:59:36,531
(The person of the first video, Yun Ha)

1247
00:59:36,532 --> 00:59:37,601
Mom.

1248
00:59:38,061 --> 00:59:40,431
You look so pretty.

1249
00:59:46,211 --> 00:59:48,841
In the first video,

1250
00:59:48,842 --> 00:59:52,181
I heard the voice of my mom or my dad.

1251
00:59:52,481 --> 00:59:54,922
I couldn't hold back tears from that moment.

1252
00:59:55,181 --> 00:59:57,081
It was when I was a baby.

1253
00:59:57,181 --> 00:59:59,092
I heard their voices.

1254
01:00:01,552 --> 01:00:02,922
What am I doing?

1255
01:00:03,461 --> 01:00:04,492
You look pretty.

1256
01:00:05,231 --> 01:00:06,391
Isn't it the first day?

1257
01:00:06,992 --> 01:00:07,992
What is that?

1258
01:00:07,993 --> 01:00:10,001
(It's the Siblings' Room on the first day.)

1259
01:00:20,211 --> 01:00:23,612
(Cheol Hyeon appears in the next shot.)

1260
01:00:25,112 --> 01:00:26,151
What?

1261
01:00:26,152 --> 01:00:27,480
"What's going on? Really?"

1262
01:00:27,481 --> 01:00:29,822
"Did I guess wrong again?"

1263
01:00:32,121 --> 01:00:33,621
For a moment, I was like, "What?"

1264
01:00:34,222 --> 01:00:35,262
What?

1265
01:00:37,262 --> 01:00:41,191
(The shot with the correct answer is revealed.)

1266
01:00:41,192 --> 01:00:43,032
- Hey. - Yes.

1267
01:00:44,601 --> 01:00:46,132
- Hey. - Yes.

1268
01:00:47,101 --> 01:00:48,572
(Surprised)

1269
01:00:49,972 --> 01:00:52,870
I could make predictions about others...

1270
01:00:52,871 --> 01:00:56,782
except for Yun Ha and Jung Sub.

1271
01:00:57,112 --> 01:01:00,881
I thought Jung Sub was a sibling of Ji Won.

1272
01:01:00,882 --> 01:01:05,051
I was so sure about Se Seung and Jung Sub.

1273
01:01:05,052 --> 01:01:07,251
So it got me surprised.

1274
01:01:07,422 --> 01:01:10,591
I'm very quick-witted.

1275
01:01:10,592 --> 01:01:12,931
So many people say I'm scary.

1276
01:01:13,532 --> 01:01:14,891
"Was I that oblivious?"

1277
01:01:15,601 --> 01:01:18,302
I thought like that.

1278
01:01:18,931 --> 01:01:20,771
- Are you okay? - How about you?

1279
01:01:21,001 --> 01:01:22,242
I missed you.

1280
01:01:26,972 --> 01:01:28,271
You're the prettiest.

1281
01:01:30,442 --> 01:01:33,411
That's too sweet.

1282
01:01:33,811 --> 01:01:38,422
Is there a younger brother so sweet to his older sister in the world?

1283
01:01:39,652 --> 01:01:42,492
It's something I can't and I don't want to hear...

1284
01:01:42,922 --> 01:01:45,831
from my sibling.

1285
01:01:46,092 --> 01:01:48,532
So I was amazed rather than being envious.

1286
01:01:48,902 --> 01:01:50,702
So there are siblings like them too.

1287
01:01:50,961 --> 01:01:53,000
How can he say...

1288
01:01:53,001 --> 01:01:55,342
that he missed his sibling?

1289
01:01:55,771 --> 01:01:57,572
He can say something like that to his sibling?

1290
01:01:58,411 --> 01:02:02,041
How can he be so lovely and sweet?

1291
01:02:02,211 --> 01:02:06,711
It made me like him even more.

1292
01:02:09,282 --> 01:02:10,551
When you look at your children,

1293
01:02:10,552 --> 01:02:11,822
do you think they're like your younger selves?

1294
01:02:11,992 --> 01:02:13,451
I get surprised when I see Yun Ha.

1295
01:02:13,452 --> 01:02:14,822
It feels like I'm looking at myself.

1296
01:02:15,121 --> 01:02:17,661
They look alike a lot.

1297
01:02:17,762 --> 01:02:19,761
- Even the way they speak. - Right.

1298
01:02:19,762 --> 01:02:20,762
Yes.

1299
01:02:22,601 --> 01:02:23,762
We do look alike each other.

1300
01:02:24,101 --> 01:02:26,471
"The siblings they gave birth to..."

1301
01:02:26,472 --> 01:02:28,230
"became like this."

1302
01:02:28,231 --> 01:02:30,071
I kept thinking like that.

1303
01:02:30,072 --> 01:02:32,971
Watching the video, I thought...

1304
01:02:32,972 --> 01:02:35,541
I should be really nice to them.

1305
01:02:35,782 --> 01:02:38,282
I didn't listen to them...

1306
01:02:38,612 --> 01:02:41,052
or was mean to them many times.

1307
01:02:41,481 --> 01:02:43,382
Those moments came to my mind.

1308
01:02:43,681 --> 01:02:46,521
I thought I should be really nice to them.

1309
01:02:47,251 --> 01:02:49,261
(The story of the next siblings will begin soon.)

1310
01:02:49,262 --> 01:02:50,891
What is this?

1311
01:02:51,422 --> 01:02:53,061
This is so fun.

1312
01:02:53,692 --> 01:02:56,362
- It's cool. - Seriously.

1313
01:02:58,032 --> 01:02:59,601
- I can call him my brother now. - Oh, my.

1314
01:03:01,132 --> 01:03:03,171
You guys seem very close.

1315
01:03:03,172 --> 01:03:04,172
Right.

1316
01:03:07,172 --> 01:03:09,012
He cherishes his sister very much.

1317
01:03:09,382 --> 01:03:12,452
Cherishing someone who is closest to you...

1318
01:03:12,911 --> 01:03:15,052
shows their true nature.

1319
01:03:15,351 --> 01:03:18,080
He must have a warm heart.

1320
01:03:18,081 --> 01:03:19,551
Jung Sub said...

1321
01:03:19,552 --> 01:03:21,451
he mostly met older women.

1322
01:03:21,452 --> 01:03:23,391
Watching them, I could tell why.

1323
01:03:24,561 --> 01:03:27,991
He must've acted like a cute younger brother in a relationship...

1324
01:03:27,992 --> 01:03:29,401
like he does to his older sister.

1325
01:03:29,402 --> 01:03:31,302
He suddenly became a baby.

1326
01:03:32,331 --> 01:03:33,601
I thought it was cute.

1327
01:03:34,731 --> 01:03:35,801
It's touching.

1328
01:03:35,802 --> 01:03:37,640
- For real. - It's very touching.

1329
01:03:37,641 --> 01:03:39,140
Their parents are so...

1330
01:03:39,141 --> 01:03:40,710
- They look like really nice people. - They're funny and cheerful.

1331
01:03:40,711 --> 01:03:42,111
I thought these two...

1332
01:03:42,112 --> 01:03:43,140
- were siblings at first. - You did?

1333
01:03:43,141 --> 01:03:45,381
- Really? - I think we kind of look alike.

1334
01:03:45,382 --> 01:03:46,481
I see.

1335
01:03:47,452 --> 01:03:49,850
(A suspicious groaning is heard from the 2nd floor at that moment.)

1336
01:03:49,851 --> 01:03:50,882
Oh, gosh.

1337
01:03:51,222 --> 01:03:52,492
(Oh, gosh)

1338
01:03:53,192 --> 01:03:54,751
(Sighing)

1339
01:03:55,722 --> 01:03:56,762
Oh, my.

1340
01:03:57,722 --> 01:03:59,061
(Oh, my)

1341
01:03:59,492 --> 01:04:01,561
(He's nervous.)

1342
01:04:02,101 --> 01:04:04,831
(1 hour ago)

1343
01:04:05,231 --> 01:04:08,101
(Yun Jae is preparing a grand entrance.)

1344
01:04:08,572 --> 01:04:10,672
I'm not that nervous.

1345
01:04:11,871 --> 01:04:14,041
What else can I do? I should do it because I'm here.

1346
01:04:19,351 --> 01:04:20,512
How did I end up coming here?

1347
01:04:22,121 --> 01:04:23,952
(He can hear other people.)

1348
01:04:27,652 --> 01:04:29,290
(The atmosphere is getting better.)

1349
01:04:29,291 --> 01:04:30,592
It's so good.

1350
01:04:30,961 --> 01:04:31,992
This is bad.

1351
01:04:32,092 --> 01:04:34,592
(Shaking)

1352
01:04:34,992 --> 01:04:36,802
The motto in my life is to live quietly,

1353
01:04:37,132 --> 01:04:38,302
not seen by others.

1354
01:04:38,931 --> 01:04:43,171
(Sighing)

1355
01:04:43,172 --> 01:04:45,072
(Agonizing)

1356
01:04:47,472 --> 01:04:50,181
I was like, "I should relax."

1357
01:04:50,411 --> 01:04:53,152
But a few minutes later, I became like, "Why am I here?"

1358
01:04:53,382 --> 01:04:54,782
"How did I end up here?"

1359
01:04:55,222 --> 01:04:56,952
(Not knowing how nervous her sibling is, )

1360
01:04:57,222 --> 01:04:59,620
(she's having fun.)

1361
01:04:59,621 --> 01:05:01,960
(Quiet)

1362
01:05:01,961 --> 01:05:03,891
I think I hear my sister's voice.

1363
01:05:04,121 --> 01:05:05,121
(Laughing)

1364
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:06,831
It's her.

1365
01:05:07,391 --> 01:05:08,632
The voice I don't want to hear.

1366
01:05:09,302 --> 01:05:11,302
When I heard Ji Won's voice, I thought,

1367
01:05:11,762 --> 01:05:13,571
"She might not know I'm here."

1368
01:05:13,572 --> 01:05:15,472
I thought it'd be fun.

1369
01:05:15,942 --> 01:05:18,771
But hearing more and more voices, I became extremely nervous.

1370
01:05:19,612 --> 01:05:21,541
(Almost crying)

1371
01:05:22,041 --> 01:05:25,012
(He's waiting in tears.)

1372
01:05:26,552 --> 01:05:27,751
Not much time is left.

1373
01:05:28,211 --> 01:05:29,351
I'm so excited.

1374
01:05:30,222 --> 01:05:33,621
Three, two, one, go.

1375
01:05:34,452 --> 01:05:40,231
(Yong Woo, the person of the second video)

1376
01:05:40,632 --> 01:05:41,831
Show me a dazzling smile.

1377
01:05:42,702 --> 01:05:43,730
A dazzling smile.

1378
01:05:43,731 --> 01:05:45,331
A dazzling smile, not an awkward smile.

1379
01:05:48,672 --> 01:05:50,202
Yong Woo is my firstborn.

1380
01:05:50,742 --> 01:05:53,442
I don't know why, but hearing my mother's voice,

1381
01:05:54,271 --> 01:05:56,180
I had strange feelings.

1382
01:05:56,181 --> 01:06:00,112
Other parents would've taken great care of their children,

1383
01:06:00,452 --> 01:06:02,851
but I couldn't take care of him much, using work as an excuse.

1384
01:06:03,052 --> 01:06:05,891
He was such a playful kid. When I came home,

1385
01:06:06,152 --> 01:06:09,092
I often saw him reading books.

1386
01:06:09,561 --> 01:06:11,120
As a working mother,

1387
01:06:11,121 --> 01:06:14,192
it relieved me somehow.

1388
01:06:14,632 --> 01:06:16,101
I thought, "He's growing well."

1389
01:06:19,672 --> 01:06:21,172
Do you remember when your sibling was born?

1390
01:06:21,771 --> 01:06:23,371
Yes, I do.

1391
01:06:24,101 --> 01:06:25,242
I was ten.

1392
01:06:26,211 --> 01:06:27,242
Suddenly...

1393
01:06:28,842 --> 01:06:30,641
The age gap is quite big.

1394
01:06:31,411 --> 01:06:33,251
- The age gap is big. - I guess so.

1395
01:06:34,512 --> 01:06:35,621
"I guess so."

1396
01:06:36,521 --> 01:06:39,322
(22 years later)

1397
01:06:47,291 --> 01:06:49,461
- How was it? - Well...

1398
01:06:49,632 --> 01:06:51,060
I think you're enjoying this much more than I do.

1399
01:06:51,061 --> 01:06:52,101
- Me? - Yes.

1400
01:06:52,902 --> 01:06:54,132
They look the same.

1401
01:06:55,132 --> 01:06:56,842
- They look the same. - They look the same.

1402
01:06:56,972 --> 01:06:58,072
They look exactly the same.

1403
01:06:58,342 --> 01:07:00,741
Oh, my goodness.

1404
01:07:00,742 --> 01:07:01,842
They really look alike each other.

1405
01:07:02,442 --> 01:07:03,841
Yong Woo and Ju Yeon.

1406
01:07:03,842 --> 01:07:05,480
Yong Woo and Ju Yeon.

1407
01:07:05,481 --> 01:07:07,111
Ju Yeon and Yong Woo.

1408
01:07:07,112 --> 01:07:08,481
They look alike so much.

1409
01:07:08,722 --> 01:07:10,922
Of course, I knew Yong Woo and Ju Yeon were siblings.

1410
01:07:11,481 --> 01:07:14,422
He says, "I changed your diapers."

1411
01:07:14,722 --> 01:07:16,862
I can't really remember fighting with my brother.

1412
01:07:17,461 --> 01:07:19,762
Yong Woo was fascinated by his sister.

1413
01:07:19,992 --> 01:07:22,231
He thought she was cute and adored her.

1414
01:07:22,702 --> 01:07:26,572
In a way, Ju Yeon maintained her innocence into adulthood...

1415
01:07:26,871 --> 01:07:28,801
because she was protected...

1416
01:07:28,802 --> 01:07:31,341
and influenced by her brother in a good way.

1417
01:07:31,342 --> 01:07:35,210
I thought that must be why she grew into the lovely person she is now.

1418
01:07:35,211 --> 01:07:36,242
It's so cool.

1419
01:07:36,442 --> 01:07:38,012
He has no flaws.

1420
01:07:38,411 --> 01:07:39,981
If I had an older brother,

1421
01:07:40,382 --> 01:07:43,481
I would've been most envious of her for having a brother like him.

1422
01:07:43,652 --> 01:07:46,552
He must be a very nice person and a brother.

1423
01:07:47,422 --> 01:07:49,322
- First... - Is it mine?

1424
01:07:49,762 --> 01:07:50,922
When did he become mature?

1425
01:07:51,561 --> 01:07:54,362
I don't remember a specific moment.

1426
01:07:54,791 --> 01:07:57,431
He just had to be mature since he was little.

1427
01:07:57,961 --> 01:07:59,532
When I watch videos,

1428
01:07:59,931 --> 01:08:01,902
he doesn't look so happy.

1429
01:08:02,032 --> 01:08:03,641
You should let your brother do it.

1430
01:08:05,511 --> 01:08:08,041
I saw footage of Yong Woo...

1431
01:08:08,042 --> 01:08:10,582
when he was a teenager.

1432
01:08:10,712 --> 01:08:14,711
It seems he didn't smile as much as before.

1433
01:08:14,712 --> 01:08:16,881
I felt bad.

1434
01:08:17,322 --> 01:08:20,851
Did he have to mature early,

1435
01:08:21,021 --> 01:08:23,622
raising his sister who was too young?

1436
01:08:24,261 --> 01:08:25,930
Since when we were little,

1437
01:08:25,931 --> 01:08:30,231
we've been determined or obsessed with the idea...

1438
01:08:30,402 --> 01:08:33,402
that we should live an independent life.

1439
01:08:33,532 --> 01:08:35,701
We were similar in that way,

1440
01:08:35,702 --> 01:08:39,442
growing up together.

1441
01:08:41,171 --> 01:08:44,681
I wanted them to throw a tantrum too,

1442
01:08:45,511 --> 01:08:47,752
but both of them...

1443
01:08:47,881 --> 01:08:50,122
had to think about others first in a way.

1444
01:08:51,152 --> 01:08:53,292
It broke my heart.

1445
01:08:53,822 --> 01:08:55,822
"Why do they not throw a tantrum even once?"

1446
01:08:56,521 --> 01:08:58,691
"Why are they never defiant?"

1447
01:08:58,692 --> 01:09:00,291
"Why do they not make their mom angry?"

1448
01:09:00,292 --> 01:09:01,862
It seemed strange to me.

1449
01:09:02,332 --> 01:09:04,260
The influence I wanted to have...

1450
01:09:04,261 --> 01:09:05,931
as a mother.

1451
01:09:06,131 --> 01:09:07,431
"Let's not be sick."

1452
01:09:07,731 --> 01:09:09,841
"If I'm sick,"

1453
01:09:11,841 --> 01:09:13,072
"it will break my children's hearts..."

1454
01:09:14,641 --> 01:09:16,912
"more than anything."

1455
01:09:17,742 --> 01:09:19,152
"I should stay healthy no matter what."

1456
01:09:20,752 --> 01:09:22,152
I think the three of us...

1457
01:09:22,782 --> 01:09:25,921
are equally fulfilling the role of a dad.

1458
01:09:28,492 --> 01:09:30,221
I don't think it's a flaw.

1459
01:09:31,162 --> 01:09:33,532
I know my dad didn't divorce her...

1460
01:09:34,332 --> 01:09:36,662
because he didn't love me.

1461
01:09:36,962 --> 01:09:40,731
I thought a lot about Yong Woo.

1462
01:09:41,072 --> 01:09:44,341
He looked mature...

1463
01:09:44,641 --> 01:09:48,141
because he had a sense of responsibility...

1464
01:09:48,341 --> 01:09:51,741
for his younger sister and mother as the eldest son.

1465
01:09:51,742 --> 01:09:55,112
It's something only those who have been through it know.

1466
01:09:55,622 --> 01:09:58,322
So I thought a lot about that.

1467
01:09:59,452 --> 01:10:02,520
I felt Yong Woo...

1468
01:10:02,521 --> 01:10:06,292
was a very diligent and responsible person even before that.

1469
01:10:06,362 --> 01:10:08,560
I realized he seemed like that...

1470
01:10:08,561 --> 01:10:11,402
because of the experience he had when he was little.

1471
01:10:11,662 --> 01:10:13,671
I liked that side of him.

1472
01:10:14,131 --> 01:10:20,072
I often thought he was not used to expressing his feelings.

1473
01:10:21,841 --> 01:10:25,681
And I understood why.

1474
01:10:26,381 --> 01:10:29,082
"How come he's been hiding it so well?"

1475
01:10:29,652 --> 01:10:33,292
"It can't be good not to talk about it like that."

1476
01:10:33,792 --> 01:10:37,792
But he showed his feelings after coming here.

1477
01:10:38,061 --> 01:10:40,192
He always cried.

1478
01:10:40,792 --> 01:10:43,101
And I think that's great.

1479
01:10:44,061 --> 01:10:45,771
He needed a time like this.

1480
01:10:46,101 --> 01:10:48,702
I don't cry often.

1481
01:10:49,141 --> 01:10:52,372
And I don't usually talk about my family or myself.

1482
01:10:52,872 --> 01:10:54,671
I thought I must've come here...

1483
01:10:55,171 --> 01:10:57,641
to talk about it...

1484
01:10:58,212 --> 01:11:00,612
and express my pent-up emotions in some way.

1485
01:11:01,011 --> 01:11:03,782
We share the same emotions with one another.

1486
01:11:03,981 --> 01:11:07,191
We're like a family now.

1487
01:11:07,192 --> 01:11:09,921
It felt quite liberating...

1488
01:11:10,462 --> 01:11:11,792
that I could spend the moment with them.

1489
01:11:13,662 --> 01:11:14,692
In my lifetime...

1490
01:11:14,992 --> 01:11:16,162
You're shedding all the tears you'll ever shed, right?

1491
01:11:17,462 --> 01:11:19,401
- You guys look alike so much. - We look exactly the same, right?

1492
01:11:19,402 --> 01:11:20,872
Watching you guys talking...

1493
01:11:21,872 --> 01:11:23,901
- Me too. - Me too.

1494
01:11:23,902 --> 01:11:26,111
- I was watching them talking. - I saw their side profiles.

1495
01:11:26,112 --> 01:11:27,872
(What?)

1496
01:11:28,412 --> 01:11:29,480
- "What is it?" - "Wait."

1497
01:11:29,481 --> 01:11:30,510
- "Is it decalcomania?" - They're the spitting image...

1498
01:11:30,511 --> 01:11:31,612
- of each other. - Right.

1499
01:11:31,942 --> 01:11:34,212
Yes. I knew it when I saw your side profile.

1500
01:11:34,412 --> 01:11:36,521
I told her not to come closer, but she kept coming.

1501
01:11:37,551 --> 01:11:38,621
I kept telling her...

1502
01:11:38,622 --> 01:11:40,351
- not to come closer. - "Don't come closer."

1503
01:11:40,692 --> 01:11:41,822
But she kept coming.

1504
01:11:43,891 --> 01:11:45,391
- Five, four, three. - Three.

1505
01:11:45,662 --> 01:11:47,590
- Two, one. - I mean...

1506
01:11:47,591 --> 01:11:48,662
(The story of the next siblings will begin soon.)

1507
01:11:48,931 --> 01:11:52,771
Raise your hands high

1508
01:11:54,072 --> 01:11:58,101
Raise your hands high

1509
01:11:58,641 --> 01:11:59,712
It must be him.

1510
01:12:00,311 --> 01:12:02,680
(Jae Hyung, the person of the third video)

1511
01:12:02,681 --> 01:12:03,781
Jump high

1512
01:12:03,782 --> 01:12:05,612
You're doing good, Jae Hyung.

1513
01:12:06,181 --> 01:12:08,051
You're doing good, Jae Hyung.

1514
01:12:08,681 --> 01:12:09,721
Jae Hyung.

1515
01:12:10,681 --> 01:12:12,622
He wouldn't get off me.

1516
01:12:13,492 --> 01:12:14,492
My baby.

1517
01:12:15,221 --> 01:12:19,191
I've never felt more grateful in my life.

1518
01:12:19,192 --> 01:12:20,292
I was so thankful.

1519
01:12:22,261 --> 01:12:23,332
Yes. It was tough.

1520
01:12:24,862 --> 01:12:25,971
Jae Hyung...

1521
01:12:29,101 --> 01:12:31,971
Jae Hyung is a very good-looking guy.

1522
01:12:32,242 --> 01:12:35,542
Whenever he goes, the elderly people say he's cute and handsome.

1523
01:12:37,212 --> 01:12:39,912
I rarely cry.

1524
01:12:41,082 --> 01:12:42,381
But when I do,

1525
01:12:44,521 --> 01:12:45,752
it's mostly when I feel wronged.

1526
01:12:47,192 --> 01:12:50,261
Hearing my mom's voice when I was little...

1527
01:13:10,981 --> 01:13:12,011
I...

1528
01:13:12,652 --> 01:13:14,082
I don't know why.

1529
01:13:15,011 --> 01:13:19,692
I was very weak when I was little.

1530
01:13:21,051 --> 01:13:22,791
I underwent many surgeries...

1531
01:13:22,792 --> 01:13:24,591
and often went to the hospital.

1532
01:13:25,091 --> 01:13:27,431
So my mom has cherished me so much...

1533
01:13:28,162 --> 01:13:30,962
since I was little.

1534
01:13:31,931 --> 01:13:35,841
My mom loved me a lot.

1535
01:13:38,002 --> 01:13:39,442
Maybe that's why.

1536
01:13:41,612 --> 01:13:44,511
He was very sick when he was little.

1537
01:13:51,381 --> 01:13:53,591
This is so hard.

1538
01:13:55,622 --> 01:13:56,662
He...

1539
01:13:57,862 --> 01:14:00,792
had to endure it by himself many times.

1540
01:14:01,862 --> 01:14:03,461
I was physically weak when I was little.

1541
01:14:03,462 --> 01:14:05,531
And it felt like it made me mentally weak as well.

1542
01:14:05,532 --> 01:14:07,771
I became very healthy...

1543
01:14:08,332 --> 01:14:09,640
after I became an adult.

1544
01:14:09,641 --> 01:14:12,072
Since then, I haven't been really sick.

1545
01:14:12,271 --> 01:14:15,372
I often thought I didn't want to become weak again.

1546
01:14:15,612 --> 01:14:17,782
I wanted to overcome it.

1547
01:14:18,212 --> 01:14:19,652
So...

1548
01:14:20,782 --> 01:14:24,551
I often argued with my mom and hurt her feelings...

1549
01:14:24,822 --> 01:14:28,851
because I couldn't express my feelings nicely.

1550
01:14:29,051 --> 01:14:31,421
I was mostly sorry.

1551
01:14:32,662 --> 01:14:34,060
(Jae Hyung's sibling)

1552
01:14:34,061 --> 01:14:37,930
(Park Jae Hyung's sibling)

1553
01:14:37,931 --> 01:14:39,131
(Park Se Seung)

1554
01:14:39,872 --> 01:14:40,902
Hi.

1555
01:14:46,341 --> 01:14:48,612
It surprised me a little. Jae Hyung and Se Seung.

1556
01:14:49,242 --> 01:14:50,742
I thought they were both X-men.

1557
01:14:50,841 --> 01:14:51,981
I thought they were strangers.

1558
01:14:52,481 --> 01:14:54,981
I'm Park Jae Hyung. She's my backup dancer.

1559
01:14:55,582 --> 01:14:57,050
I'm Park Se Seung.

1560
01:14:57,051 --> 01:14:58,381
- Hello. - Hello.

1561
01:15:00,992 --> 01:15:02,091
You're Park?

1562
01:15:03,862 --> 01:15:04,862
It's cute.

1563
01:15:05,561 --> 01:15:09,701
(August 8, 2002)

1564
01:15:09,702 --> 01:15:13,430
No matter how many times I'm reborn

1565
01:15:13,431 --> 01:15:15,031
- And leave - You've been singing since then?

1566
01:15:15,032 --> 01:15:16,702
(He feels shy.)

1567
01:15:16,902 --> 01:15:20,212
These days, Jae Hyung acts cold outside but is warm inside.

1568
01:15:20,442 --> 01:15:23,112
He thinks he should take care of me.

1569
01:15:23,481 --> 01:15:25,211
He thinks I'm like a child.

1570
01:15:25,212 --> 01:15:26,351
Yes. He's like that.

1571
01:15:27,282 --> 01:15:29,011
I can tell...

1572
01:15:29,481 --> 01:15:31,752
both my mom and dad became old.

1573
01:15:33,292 --> 01:15:35,822
That's why.

1574
01:15:38,221 --> 01:15:40,090
My mom was also sick once...

1575
01:15:40,091 --> 01:15:41,431
when I was in Germany.

1576
01:15:41,931 --> 01:15:45,032
She didn't tell me not to worry me.

1577
01:15:45,561 --> 01:15:48,702
She was diagnosed with cancer.

1578
01:15:48,832 --> 01:15:51,470
She's fully recovered now.

1579
01:15:51,471 --> 01:15:52,841
But she had a hard time.

1580
01:15:54,011 --> 01:15:56,582
She's a delicate person.

1581
01:15:56,912 --> 01:15:58,782
It must've been very hard for her.

1582
01:15:58,912 --> 01:16:01,411
I should've become a mature daughter like how I am now...

1583
01:16:01,412 --> 01:16:03,920
and protected her by her side.

1584
01:16:03,921 --> 01:16:05,181
I regretted it a lot.

1585
01:16:06,492 --> 01:16:09,091
Because she must've been stressed out because of us.

1586
01:16:10,792 --> 01:16:14,261
I got emotional when I watched her calling my younger self.

1587
01:16:15,061 --> 01:16:18,961
Because it seemed she was missing the time...

1588
01:16:18,962 --> 01:16:22,032
when I was little as I grew up.

1589
01:16:22,841 --> 01:16:25,271
Of course, I act cute around her a lot even now,

1590
01:16:25,912 --> 01:16:27,011
but I wasn't like that,

1591
01:16:28,311 --> 01:16:30,341
growing up.

1592
01:16:31,681 --> 01:16:32,712
So...

1593
01:16:34,282 --> 01:16:36,981
"Why did I do that?"

1594
01:16:40,822 --> 01:16:44,122
They reached the age when they should leave me.

1595
01:16:45,721 --> 01:16:48,361
I wish they didn't.

1596
01:16:48,362 --> 01:16:51,560
When they were little, I was the only one they had.

1597
01:16:51,561 --> 01:16:55,271
The time when we were always together is very precious.

1598
01:16:56,072 --> 01:16:57,502
So I want to go back.

1599
01:17:00,412 --> 01:17:05,212
In December last year, we went to London and Paris.

1600
01:17:05,381 --> 01:17:09,322
Jae Hyung paid for everything.

1601
01:17:10,122 --> 01:17:13,351
For two weeks, I linked my arm with his to my heart's content.

1602
01:17:13,921 --> 01:17:18,061
He said he might not have time to do that if he got married.

1603
01:17:18,521 --> 01:17:20,292
So he asked me to go on a trip together.

1604
01:17:23,801 --> 01:17:25,601
He's a good son.

1605
01:17:26,131 --> 01:17:27,970
Not many sons...

1606
01:17:27,971 --> 01:17:29,942
would go to Europe just with their mom.

1607
01:17:30,042 --> 01:17:31,042
I thought it was amazing.

1608
01:17:31,043 --> 01:17:32,571
I envied him as he could ask her...

1609
01:17:32,572 --> 01:17:34,971
to go on a trip together.

1610
01:17:35,141 --> 01:17:38,782
My mom can't ride airplanes.

1611
01:17:39,481 --> 01:17:42,350
She has a fear of flying.

1612
01:17:42,351 --> 01:17:46,151
She finds it very difficult...

1613
01:17:46,152 --> 01:17:48,351
to leave the place where she feels safe.

1614
01:17:48,692 --> 01:17:51,662
So she's never come to the country where I studied.

1615
01:17:52,391 --> 01:17:55,492
I envied that they could travel together.

1616
01:17:55,761 --> 01:18:00,331
And I realized that Jae Hyung was a much more attentive...

1617
01:18:00,332 --> 01:18:02,131
and loving person than I had thought.

1618
01:18:02,301 --> 01:18:04,001
The video definitely made me...

1619
01:18:04,002 --> 01:18:06,612
think more positively about him.

1620
01:18:06,742 --> 01:18:08,670
I hope they run like light,

1621
01:18:08,671 --> 01:18:11,712
if they think they found their partner.

1622
01:18:13,152 --> 01:18:14,252
Don't wait.

1623
01:18:17,152 --> 01:18:20,221
Your father seems very cheerful.

1624
01:18:21,752 --> 01:18:25,122
I thought you and Se Seung weren't siblings at first.

1625
01:18:25,622 --> 01:18:26,791
- I mean... - They don't look alike at all.

1626
01:18:26,792 --> 01:18:28,161
- I thought she was older than you. - We don't.

1627
01:18:28,162 --> 01:18:29,561
- It was the hardest to guess. - We don't.

1628
01:18:29,702 --> 01:18:31,431
- I had no idea. - We don't look alike at all, right?

1629
01:18:31,662 --> 01:18:33,531
You don't. I still don't know about the others.

1630
01:18:33,532 --> 01:18:36,600
I can guess now because it turned out like this.

1631
01:18:36,601 --> 01:18:38,541
- Really? I see. - I had no idea before then.

1632
01:18:38,542 --> 01:18:40,442
(Meanwhile, someone is waiting for the timing to go out.)

1633
01:18:41,542 --> 01:18:43,881
(He's curious about the 1st floor.)

1634
01:18:47,212 --> 01:18:48,311
So they're siblings.

1635
01:18:50,721 --> 01:18:52,421
(Sneaking)

1636
01:19:00,231 --> 01:19:01,731
Why do I not see the jet-black hair?

1637
01:19:02,931 --> 01:19:04,001
All I see is the back of their heads.

1638
01:19:04,002 --> 01:19:05,431
I don't know where my sister is.

1639
01:19:06,171 --> 01:19:07,231
I'm in trouble.

1640
01:19:13,471 --> 01:19:14,872
It starts with this.

1641
01:19:16,742 --> 01:19:19,211
(The person of the fourth video)

1642
01:19:19,212 --> 01:19:22,112
(Cho A)

1643
01:19:27,091 --> 01:19:30,162
"I will hold back my tears no matter what."

1644
01:19:31,761 --> 01:19:35,731
This is something that can never happen in my life.

1645
01:19:36,402 --> 01:19:38,431
It wasn't easy at first.

1646
01:19:39,261 --> 01:19:41,372
- I can tell. - Right?

1647
01:19:53,582 --> 01:19:54,611
Hi.

1648
01:19:54,612 --> 01:19:56,010
(Park Cho A's sibling, Park Cheol Hyeon)

1649
01:19:56,011 --> 01:19:57,652
How are you? How are you feeling?

1650
01:19:58,122 --> 01:19:59,951
I'm a little tired, but...

1651
01:19:59,952 --> 01:20:02,051
- I'm very worried about you. - Why?

1652
01:20:02,792 --> 01:20:04,921
- It's still fun, though. - Yes.

1653
01:20:05,362 --> 01:20:07,161
She speaks in a dialect when she talks to his brother.

1654
01:20:07,162 --> 01:20:08,162
Right.

1655
01:20:12,561 --> 01:20:14,471
Let me talk about my family.

1656
01:20:14,902 --> 01:20:18,242
My mother died of cancer when I was 20.

1657
01:20:18,702 --> 01:20:21,811
When we finished the funeral after she passed away,

1658
01:20:22,141 --> 01:20:24,082
I suggested to Cho A that we should move to Seoul.

1659
01:20:24,442 --> 01:20:27,481
At the time, I thought, "Let's do our best here."

1660
01:20:29,082 --> 01:20:31,952
I thought to myself that there was a reason those two...

1661
01:20:32,351 --> 01:20:33,622
were so close like that.

1662
01:20:35,122 --> 01:20:38,462
My instinctive desire was to go outside and have fun.

1663
01:20:38,692 --> 01:20:41,192
I wanted to do that like other people my age,

1664
01:20:41,561 --> 01:20:43,901
but I felt like I should fulfill my responsibilities.

1665
01:20:43,902 --> 01:20:46,331
When I returned from having fun, I felt like I've committed a sin.

1666
01:20:46,332 --> 01:20:47,332
I've always felt that way.

1667
01:20:47,431 --> 01:20:50,800
I took care of my mother at her deathbed and sent her off,

1668
01:20:50,801 --> 01:20:52,171
graduated, and we moved to Seoul.

1669
01:20:59,811 --> 01:21:03,420
On the outside, Cho A seems very delicate.

1670
01:21:03,421 --> 01:21:05,121
But I feel like the more you get to know her,

1671
01:21:05,122 --> 01:21:07,391
she's someone who is tough and thoughtful.

1672
01:21:08,021 --> 01:21:10,791
She's not the type to lean on...

1673
01:21:10,792 --> 01:21:14,090
her younger brother, Cheol Hyeon, or want him...

1674
01:21:14,091 --> 01:21:15,292
to take on the burden too.

1675
01:21:15,591 --> 01:21:17,531
I feel like she's the type to go,

1676
01:21:17,532 --> 01:21:18,801
"I'll sacrifice myself,"

1677
01:21:19,101 --> 01:21:20,971
"I'll take on the burden."

1678
01:21:21,301 --> 01:21:25,742
And that's why it seemed like she's endured a lot on her own.

1679
01:21:26,641 --> 01:21:28,542
At a young age, she accepted it calmly,

1680
01:21:28,841 --> 01:21:31,341
and she grew up well.

1681
01:21:31,981 --> 01:21:33,051
It's so admirable.

1682
01:21:33,381 --> 01:21:36,452
On the anniversary of Mom's death, we prepare her favourite food,

1683
01:21:36,652 --> 01:21:38,420
and I tell Cho A that we should eat something delicious.

1684
01:21:38,421 --> 01:21:40,390
Us being happy after eating what we want to eat...

1685
01:21:40,391 --> 01:21:41,652
would make Mom happy too.

1686
01:21:42,122 --> 01:21:45,192
So we set the table, bow once,

1687
01:21:45,862 --> 01:21:48,391
and I spend time with my sister.

1688
01:21:55,502 --> 01:21:57,572
I hope I am a reliable younger brother.

1689
01:21:57,801 --> 01:22:01,671
I want her to feel protected.

1690
01:22:02,311 --> 01:22:05,242
I want him to feel that there's someone who trusts him.

1691
01:22:05,612 --> 01:22:08,181
I want to be reliable for him like that.

1692
01:22:29,841 --> 01:22:31,141
Watching the video,

1693
01:22:31,242 --> 01:22:34,112
things that I can't really explain kept passing through my head.

1694
01:22:34,971 --> 01:22:37,541
I think I had a lot of thoughts.

1695
01:22:37,542 --> 01:22:41,480
On the one hand, I felt relieved through this opportunity.

1696
01:22:41,481 --> 01:22:45,020
Cho A and I have relied on each other a lot.

1697
01:22:45,021 --> 01:22:48,521
And during that process, we've had to overcome things.

1698
01:22:48,921 --> 01:22:52,361
We're doing well in life now,

1699
01:22:52,362 --> 01:22:54,191
and because we're together in this moment,

1700
01:22:54,192 --> 01:22:55,391
we get to watch this together.

1701
01:22:55,492 --> 01:22:59,001
That's what I think. I...

1702
01:22:59,002 --> 01:23:02,402
actually think it would be nice if more of that video was shown.

1703
01:23:03,301 --> 01:23:06,311
We relied and leaned on each other a lot.

1704
01:23:06,412 --> 01:23:08,311
We're all grown now, doing well in life...

1705
01:23:08,811 --> 01:23:11,411
and living with good heads on our shoulders.

1706
01:23:11,412 --> 01:23:12,542
That's what I think.

1707
01:23:12,912 --> 01:23:14,981
If things like that are shown to the viewers,

1708
01:23:15,351 --> 01:23:17,151
I think it could send...

1709
01:23:17,152 --> 01:23:20,192
a good message that there are people like us.

1710
01:23:23,192 --> 01:23:25,091
My heart was broken...

1711
01:23:25,192 --> 01:23:28,332
not after that video but after seeing Cheol Hyeon cry.

1712
01:23:29,332 --> 01:23:33,971
I think he must have missed her.

1713
01:23:36,971 --> 01:23:40,042
I feel so lucky to have Cho A.

1714
01:23:40,341 --> 01:23:42,341
I don't know what I would have done if I didn't have her.

1715
01:23:43,381 --> 01:23:46,351
I'm so glad that Cho A is my sibling and only family.

1716
01:23:50,152 --> 01:23:51,951
- Where was that last place? - That was amazing.

1717
01:23:51,952 --> 01:23:52,980
That last place was so amazing.

1718
01:23:52,981 --> 01:23:54,252
- It looked like a movie. - Right.

1719
01:24:02,362 --> 01:24:04,362
They're not my family,

1720
01:24:05,032 --> 01:24:07,231
but they've become like my family even more.

1721
01:24:08,431 --> 01:24:12,241
You know what they say about meeting your significant other.

1722
01:24:12,242 --> 01:24:14,010
It's not about facing each other.

1723
01:24:14,011 --> 01:24:16,042
It's about facing the same direction together.

1724
01:24:16,341 --> 01:24:19,282
That doesn't necessarily have to be about couples.

1725
01:24:19,542 --> 01:24:21,880
Those two are already living their lives...

1726
01:24:21,881 --> 01:24:23,622
with that sense of partnership.

1727
01:24:24,051 --> 01:24:25,681
Their story did make me sad,

1728
01:24:26,021 --> 01:24:29,451
but I thought it was really amazing that they were able to...

1729
01:24:29,452 --> 01:24:30,521
make it here.

1730
01:24:31,391 --> 01:24:34,731
When it was Cheol Hyeon and Cho A's turn, I cried.

1731
01:24:35,162 --> 01:24:38,201
The way the two of them...

1732
01:24:38,202 --> 01:24:40,371
rely on each other...

1733
01:24:40,372 --> 01:24:42,032
is so great and admirable.

1734
01:24:42,471 --> 01:24:45,902
It was so nice to get to know them on a deeper level.

1735
01:24:46,171 --> 01:24:49,612
It's such a relief that Cho A has a younger brother...

1736
01:24:49,712 --> 01:24:51,442
like Cheol Hyeon.

1737
01:24:51,742 --> 01:24:55,612
I think that's why I felt close to her.

1738
01:24:56,112 --> 01:24:59,550
Cho A's ideal type could be someone...

1739
01:24:59,551 --> 01:25:03,721
reliable that she can lean on.

1740
01:25:03,822 --> 01:25:05,661
I could understand her on a deeper level...

1741
01:25:05,662 --> 01:25:07,591
compared to just hearing her say that.

1742
01:25:10,561 --> 01:25:13,332
Everything's so pretty.

1743
01:25:17,471 --> 01:25:19,271
Your eyes are so puffy, they're three times as big.

1744
01:25:20,042 --> 01:25:21,242
What should I do?

1745
01:25:25,042 --> 01:25:26,452
(Meanwhile, Yun Jae is on the 2nd floor.)

1746
01:25:26,851 --> 01:25:29,181
(He's cautiously spying on them.)

1747
01:25:30,881 --> 01:25:31,921
Please.

1748
01:25:33,792 --> 01:25:34,952
Please, please.

1749
01:25:35,252 --> 01:25:36,591
No, no.

1750
01:25:37,761 --> 01:25:39,692
(The next video plays without any mercy.)

1751
01:25:42,162 --> 01:25:45,561
(The star of the last video)

1752
01:25:45,662 --> 01:25:47,532
(Happy First Birthday, Kim Ji Won)

1753
01:25:47,872 --> 01:25:48,872
Gosh.

1754
01:25:51,471 --> 01:25:53,640
- Your last name is Kim. - I see.

1755
01:25:53,641 --> 01:25:55,742
- I see. - Her last name is Kim.

1756
01:25:56,881 --> 01:25:59,081
- Happy birthday. - I want to take pictures.

1757
01:25:59,082 --> 01:26:01,881
You're so pretty. What is this, Ji Won?

1758
01:26:03,752 --> 01:26:04,981
You're so pretty.

1759
01:26:05,082 --> 01:26:07,351
My baby-self was sitting...

1760
01:26:07,551 --> 01:26:10,492
so sturdily like a general.

1761
01:26:12,362 --> 01:26:13,992
Our daughter used to be quite docile.

1762
01:26:14,091 --> 01:26:16,260
Her dad used to carry her around all the time,

1763
01:26:16,261 --> 01:26:18,361
and I used to carry her too. We took turns because she was heavy.

1764
01:26:18,362 --> 01:26:20,801
We taught her Hangeul when she was four.

1765
01:26:20,902 --> 01:26:23,002
And she really mastered it within three months.

1766
01:26:23,202 --> 01:26:26,340
Since she was done with Hangeul, she wanted to do something.

1767
01:26:26,341 --> 01:26:28,170
So we sent her to learn how to play the piano.

1768
01:26:28,171 --> 01:26:30,011
After a week, her teacher called and said,

1769
01:26:30,481 --> 01:26:31,811
"She plays even better than kids who are in elementary school."

1770
01:26:39,622 --> 01:26:41,792
So that's when she started playing the piano,

1771
01:26:41,891 --> 01:26:43,591
and she won awards from piano contests all over the country.

1772
01:26:43,862 --> 01:26:46,322
The third place goes to Kim Ji Won.

1773
01:26:56,301 --> 01:26:58,742
She used to be really good at playing the piano.

1774
01:26:58,942 --> 01:27:02,310
I saw that we've experienced similar childhoods,

1775
01:27:02,311 --> 01:27:05,181
so I felt a huge sense of kinship.

1776
01:27:05,282 --> 01:27:07,851
"I wonder what she was thinking back then."

1777
01:27:08,051 --> 01:27:09,111
She was so young to know anything.

1778
01:27:09,112 --> 01:27:12,021
What did she want to do so badly? What did she want to achieve?

1779
01:27:12,221 --> 01:27:14,492
I feel like I was stronger back then...

1780
01:27:14,952 --> 01:27:16,351
than I am now.

1781
01:27:17,692 --> 01:27:19,061
But then, one day she said to me,

1782
01:27:19,721 --> 01:27:23,800
"Mom, can I quit the piano and study?"

1783
01:27:23,801 --> 01:27:25,501
She said she wanted to study abroad.

1784
01:27:25,502 --> 01:27:28,770
So I... It was too abrupt. She was only ten.

1785
01:27:28,771 --> 01:27:30,702
She said, "I'll show you..."

1786
01:27:30,902 --> 01:27:33,742
"that I can succeed by studying instead of playing the piano."

1787
01:27:34,141 --> 01:27:36,880
At first, I had faith in our daughter...

1788
01:27:36,881 --> 01:27:38,381
and I knew how strong-minded she was.

1789
01:27:38,712 --> 01:27:40,850
So I had great expectations as to how well...

1790
01:27:40,851 --> 01:27:41,851
she'd do.

1791
01:27:41,852 --> 01:27:44,752
So she quit the piano and went all-in in her studies,

1792
01:27:44,851 --> 01:27:48,051
then she said she wanted to study abroad, so she went.

1793
01:27:48,521 --> 01:27:50,792
Because she was the one who wanted to go,

1794
01:27:51,061 --> 01:27:52,991
she'd never said to me,

1795
01:27:52,992 --> 01:27:54,792
"Mom, I shouldn't have come here."

1796
01:27:58,631 --> 01:28:01,231
(17 years later)

1797
01:28:01,601 --> 01:28:05,341
I first went to Canada when I was twelve.

1798
01:28:05,502 --> 01:28:08,912
It was great. I could enjoy the nature.

1799
01:28:09,311 --> 01:28:12,011
"This is why I wanted to come here so badly."

1800
01:28:12,112 --> 01:28:13,781
"The place I wanted to come..."

1801
01:28:13,782 --> 01:28:16,920
"is much better than I thought it would be."

1802
01:28:16,921 --> 01:28:18,481
I was so happy.

1803
01:28:18,782 --> 01:28:21,021
Then he started studying abroad since he was 17,

1804
01:28:21,221 --> 01:28:23,192
so we've been abroad together since then.

1805
01:28:25,591 --> 01:28:28,891
When he was little, he cried easily.

1806
01:28:29,192 --> 01:28:31,600
He was fragile, so my heart went out to him...

1807
01:28:31,601 --> 01:28:32,801
and I took care of him.

1808
01:28:33,231 --> 01:28:36,431
Our son didn't eat well, he cried, and he was sensitive.

1809
01:28:36,671 --> 01:28:37,941
He was so small when he was born.

1810
01:28:37,942 --> 01:28:40,140
He was as small as a premature baby.

1811
01:28:40,141 --> 01:28:42,041
2.85kg. He was weak.

1812
01:28:42,042 --> 01:28:43,042
He was weak.

1813
01:28:43,043 --> 01:28:46,681
So when they went to school, our daughter took care of him.

1814
01:28:47,011 --> 01:28:48,211
She was shrewd,

1815
01:28:48,212 --> 01:28:50,121
so when he was crying at his desk because he did poorly on his exam,

1816
01:28:50,122 --> 01:28:52,752
she would go and look after him.

1817
01:28:57,292 --> 01:29:00,291
We got along well but also fought a lot...

1818
01:29:00,292 --> 01:29:01,891
back when we were studying abroad.

1819
01:29:10,042 --> 01:29:11,542
(Who is Ji Won's sibling?)

1820
01:29:13,612 --> 01:29:16,212
- Is this how he's revealed? - I wonder who it is.

1821
01:29:20,612 --> 01:29:21,912
Is the video over?

1822
01:29:23,351 --> 01:29:25,451
"Someone new is coming."

1823
01:29:25,452 --> 01:29:26,551
I felt a bit of anticipation.

1824
01:29:27,952 --> 01:29:29,221
"Where is he coming from?"

1825
01:29:38,332 --> 01:29:39,862
- Gosh. - Hello.

1826
01:29:39,962 --> 01:29:41,002
- Hello. - Gosh.

1827
01:29:42,971 --> 01:29:44,002
- What's wrong with him? - Gosh.

1828
01:29:44,572 --> 01:29:45,601
Hello.

1829
01:29:46,912 --> 01:29:49,872
"Gosh, he looks exactly like Mom..."

1830
01:29:50,282 --> 01:29:51,681
"with his hair curled like that."

1831
01:29:51,782 --> 01:29:53,881
"Why does he look so pale?"

1832
01:29:54,412 --> 01:29:56,980
All of a sudden he showed up like he was in a musical.

1833
01:29:56,981 --> 01:29:58,321
Like he was in a musical...

1834
01:29:58,322 --> 01:29:59,322
Like he was in a musical...

1835
01:29:59,323 --> 01:30:01,050
He showed up like he was in a musical.

1836
01:30:01,051 --> 01:30:02,720
He looked at us like this for like three seconds...

1837
01:30:02,721 --> 01:30:04,122
and came down the stairs.

1838
01:30:04,221 --> 01:30:05,862
He appeared the way Gatsby would.

1839
01:30:06,261 --> 01:30:10,561
I've never been in the spotlight before.

1840
01:30:11,561 --> 01:30:12,760
- Hello. - Hello.

1841
01:30:12,761 --> 01:30:14,430
- Gosh. - Hello.

1842
01:30:14,431 --> 01:30:16,840
I wanted to crawl under a rock,

1843
01:30:16,841 --> 01:30:19,542
so I was determined to find Ji Won as soon as I got downstairs.

1844
01:30:19,742 --> 01:30:21,042
What's your name?

1845
01:30:22,442 --> 01:30:25,412
I'm Ji Won's older brother, Kim Yun Jae.

1846
01:30:25,511 --> 01:30:27,211
- I see. - "Yun Jae."

1847
01:30:27,212 --> 01:30:28,281
- Hello. - He's my older brother.

1848
01:30:28,282 --> 01:30:30,322
- Older brother. - He had a great first impression.

1849
01:30:30,622 --> 01:30:32,481
"He seems like a gentle person."

1850
01:30:33,421 --> 01:30:36,521
"He looks soft like tofu. Silken tofu."

1851
01:30:37,162 --> 01:30:39,391
It seemed like he was bashful.

1852
01:30:39,792 --> 01:30:42,192
I had a strong feeling that he was shy.

1853
01:30:42,862 --> 01:30:44,362
He's your older brother.

1854
01:30:45,902 --> 01:30:47,471
I am her older brother, but she's more like my older sister.

1855
01:30:48,671 --> 01:30:50,402
Watching the others...

1856
01:30:50,742 --> 01:30:53,441
I thought, "I wonder when he'll get here."

1857
01:30:53,442 --> 01:30:56,270
But knowing we'll be experiencing this together now...

1858
01:30:56,271 --> 01:30:57,511
made me happy.

1859
01:31:00,042 --> 01:31:01,152
- I see. - Nice to meet you.

1860
01:31:07,391 --> 01:31:09,191
You two are only a year apart in age.

1861
01:31:09,192 --> 01:31:10,192
- That's right. - Yes.

1862
01:31:10,193 --> 01:31:11,260
Younger ones usually don't refer to their siblings...

1863
01:31:11,261 --> 01:31:12,321
as the older brother in that case.

1864
01:31:12,322 --> 01:31:15,691
- No. - I think I've done that...

1865
01:31:15,692 --> 01:31:17,002
- not even ten times. - Right.

1866
01:31:18,702 --> 01:31:20,701
How did you start doing what you're doing for work?

1867
01:31:20,702 --> 01:31:23,471
When I returned to Korea from Canada, it was during COVID-19...

1868
01:31:23,841 --> 01:31:27,011
so not a lot of companies were hiring.

1869
01:31:27,112 --> 01:31:30,042
That's why I'm closer to my son.

1870
01:31:30,141 --> 01:31:32,810
He's more affectionate too, so I'm more comfortable with him.

1871
01:31:32,811 --> 01:31:35,081
Our daughter doesn't make mistakes, so she's harder to approach.

1872
01:31:35,082 --> 01:31:37,251
But I do feel the depth of how much...

1873
01:31:37,252 --> 01:31:38,380
our daughter cares about us.

1874
01:31:38,381 --> 01:31:40,951
The only thing her dad loves to do is...

1875
01:31:40,952 --> 01:31:42,491
to have a drink with his daughter.

1876
01:31:42,492 --> 01:31:45,622
So she tries to come home to drink with him no matter what.

1877
01:31:48,431 --> 01:31:49,930
When you see kids studying abroad,

1878
01:31:49,931 --> 01:31:52,301
a huge number of them are from wealthy families.

1879
01:31:52,662 --> 01:31:56,171
But while we were abroad, we...

1880
01:31:56,502 --> 01:31:59,541
were never living insufficiently than them.

1881
01:31:59,542 --> 01:32:01,670
We actually were more comfortable.

1882
01:32:01,671 --> 01:32:03,411
So a lot of our friends thought...

1883
01:32:03,412 --> 01:32:05,612
we were from wealthy families.

1884
01:32:06,341 --> 01:32:07,781
Back then, I was really desperate.

1885
01:32:07,782 --> 01:32:10,880
Schools abroad take tuition payments...

1886
01:32:10,881 --> 01:32:12,322
in late August.

1887
01:32:12,421 --> 01:32:15,050
So then, we'd take out loans and get money in advance.

1888
01:32:15,051 --> 01:32:17,122
But then we'd be short about 3,600 to 4,400 dollars.

1889
01:32:17,221 --> 01:32:20,162
So I would make all the side dishes to afford that.

1890
01:32:20,792 --> 01:32:23,362
That's how we were able to pay for it.

1891
01:32:26,731 --> 01:32:28,971
I studied abroad for about ten years.

1892
01:32:29,402 --> 01:32:31,771
For me, the time went by really quickly.

1893
01:32:32,671 --> 01:32:35,671
But for my mother, that time must have felt so heavy.

1894
01:32:38,681 --> 01:32:42,181
I got a call saying Mom collapsed.

1895
01:32:51,662 --> 01:32:54,390
My son graduated for the last time in May,

1896
01:32:54,391 --> 01:32:56,162
two years ago.

1897
01:32:56,662 --> 01:33:00,671
Once his last tuition bill was paid, I felt so lighthearted I could fly.

1898
01:33:00,872 --> 01:33:03,270
They were studying abroad for a very long time,

1899
01:33:03,271 --> 01:33:04,670
so it was really hard for me.

1900
01:33:04,671 --> 01:33:06,601
I didn't show that to the kids,

1901
01:33:06,801 --> 01:33:08,412
but it was very hard for me.

1902
01:33:08,771 --> 01:33:10,242
Once that strain was gone,

1903
01:33:10,582 --> 01:33:12,480
I got diagnosed.

1904
01:33:12,481 --> 01:33:15,381
I was diagnosed with cancer coincidentally.

1905
01:33:15,681 --> 01:33:20,622
At the time, what made me sad was...

1906
01:33:21,021 --> 01:33:23,721
that I devoted my whole life to support the kids...

1907
01:33:27,591 --> 01:33:29,192
and I was proud of myself for that,

1908
01:33:30,702 --> 01:33:32,131
but now I'd be hurting them.

1909
01:33:37,601 --> 01:33:39,072
But now I'd be hurting them.

1910
01:33:44,481 --> 01:33:45,881
So at the time...

1911
01:33:51,681 --> 01:33:53,282
I just think...

1912
01:33:53,822 --> 01:33:56,992
our mom only ever worries about us.

1913
01:33:57,362 --> 01:34:00,391
So rather than thinking about...

1914
01:34:00,761 --> 01:34:03,832
what to do because she found out she was sick,

1915
01:34:04,402 --> 01:34:07,301
"I'm hurting my kids,"

1916
01:34:09,931 --> 01:34:12,702
was her thought.

1917
01:34:13,242 --> 01:34:14,872
That's what broke my heart the most.

1918
01:34:19,042 --> 01:34:21,112
I expected her to say something like,

1919
01:34:21,782 --> 01:34:23,681
"I supported my kids my whole life,"

1920
01:34:24,282 --> 01:34:25,582
"but since I was diagnosed,"

1921
01:34:25,752 --> 01:34:28,891
"I wondered what had happened to my life."

1922
01:34:31,162 --> 01:34:34,532
The moment when it's hard for moms...

1923
01:34:35,731 --> 01:34:37,801
isn't when they're going through hardship.

1924
01:34:39,502 --> 01:34:44,242
I think it's the most hard for them when we are hurt.

1925
01:34:45,502 --> 01:34:47,912
I asked if it could be treated, and the doctor said...

1926
01:34:48,311 --> 01:34:51,441
it's not guaranteed.

1927
01:34:51,442 --> 01:34:53,311
And so, the kids' father...

1928
01:34:54,311 --> 01:34:56,112
believed that we should tell the kids.

1929
01:34:56,212 --> 01:34:58,220
Just in case something happened to me.

1930
01:34:58,221 --> 01:35:00,822
As soon as I stepped into the hospital room, my mom...

1931
01:35:01,192 --> 01:35:04,291
seemed like she had prepared what to say. When I sat down,

1932
01:35:04,292 --> 01:35:06,161
she went, "Listen to me carefully."

1933
01:35:06,162 --> 01:35:08,761
"This and this, you have to organize them this way."

1934
01:35:08,862 --> 01:35:13,161
"This and this should be prepared like this."

1935
01:35:13,162 --> 01:35:14,402
That's what she said.

1936
01:35:14,601 --> 01:35:17,741
So even though I had my emotions under control,

1937
01:35:17,742 --> 01:35:19,801
that's when I burst into tears.

1938
01:35:20,101 --> 01:35:23,980
When I burst into tears... My mom had been trying not to cry.

1939
01:35:23,981 --> 01:35:27,252
But once she saw me crying, she was like, "Why are you crying?"

1940
01:35:28,681 --> 01:35:30,421
And then she started crying herself.

1941
01:35:32,051 --> 01:35:33,681
My daughter told me,

1942
01:35:34,452 --> 01:35:36,591
"For the first time in my life,"

1943
01:35:37,021 --> 01:35:38,791
"I feel like I've lived life the wrong way."

1944
01:35:38,792 --> 01:35:40,191
That's what my daughter thought.

1945
01:35:40,192 --> 01:35:41,231
So I asked her why, and she said...

1946
01:35:41,992 --> 01:35:46,060
that she had thought...

1947
01:35:46,061 --> 01:35:47,832
doing whatever I asked of her,

1948
01:35:48,002 --> 01:35:49,670
like "be a good person," "study hard..."

1949
01:35:49,671 --> 01:35:51,942
was what she could do for me.

1950
01:35:52,042 --> 01:35:55,611
But while she was doing all that,

1951
01:35:55,612 --> 01:35:57,582
she didn't realize her mom had gotten sick.

1952
01:35:58,011 --> 01:36:00,652
During all that time, her mom was financially supporting them...

1953
01:36:01,181 --> 01:36:02,782
and got sick while doing so,

1954
01:36:02,881 --> 01:36:05,582
and it was as if she neglected her mom and let that happen to her.

1955
01:36:05,681 --> 01:36:07,920
So that...

1956
01:36:07,921 --> 01:36:10,861
made her think, "Gosh, I've lived life the wrong way,"

1957
01:36:10,862 --> 01:36:13,192
for the first time in her life.

1958
01:36:16,292 --> 01:36:17,701
To be honest, at work,

1959
01:36:17,702 --> 01:36:21,131
the thing I do most is check how the singers are doing.

1960
01:36:22,402 --> 01:36:23,872
Did they eat?

1961
01:36:24,072 --> 01:36:26,042
Did they take their medication on time?

1962
01:36:26,771 --> 01:36:30,271
I accompany them on their busy schedules and take care of them.

1963
01:36:30,881 --> 01:36:34,981
But I didn't even know my mom was getting sick...

1964
01:36:35,481 --> 01:36:36,811
in the meantime.

1965
01:36:39,122 --> 01:36:41,822
So that made me think I've lived life the wrong way.

1966
01:36:44,061 --> 01:36:46,061
Once I got sick,

1967
01:36:47,162 --> 01:36:50,430
I started thinking that maybe I wouldn't be able to...

1968
01:36:50,431 --> 01:36:51,832
fulfill my role as our daughter's mom.

1969
01:36:51,931 --> 01:36:54,101
And, in my head, I saw the times that already...

1970
01:36:54,372 --> 01:36:56,532
passed us by.

1971
01:36:56,902 --> 01:36:59,042
"That's right. I didn't know..."

1972
01:36:59,301 --> 01:37:01,712
"when she had her puberty."

1973
01:37:02,242 --> 01:37:04,582
"I didn't know when she began her period."

1974
01:37:04,681 --> 01:37:07,680
And that hurt me so much.

1975
01:37:07,681 --> 01:37:11,350
It's like... She went abroad at ten years old.

1976
01:37:11,351 --> 01:37:13,122
I didn't know about where and how she was sick.

1977
01:37:13,891 --> 01:37:15,550
When she lost her teeth,

1978
01:37:15,551 --> 01:37:16,951
when she began her period,

1979
01:37:16,952 --> 01:37:18,621
how uncomfortable she was because of it.

1980
01:37:18,622 --> 01:37:20,761
I didn't know any of that as her mom.

1981
01:37:21,261 --> 01:37:23,191
But when I was financially supporting you,

1982
01:37:23,192 --> 01:37:25,161
I didn't even have the time to think about all that.

1983
01:37:25,162 --> 01:37:26,230
That's how busy I had been.

1984
01:37:26,231 --> 01:37:27,801
But now I'm sick,

1985
01:37:27,902 --> 01:37:29,801
and I'm looking back at my daughter as her mom.

1986
01:37:30,471 --> 01:37:33,501
Most parents get their daughters flowers when they get their periods,

1987
01:37:33,502 --> 01:37:35,471
but we didn't do any of that.

1988
01:37:35,942 --> 01:37:37,980
"I thought doing all this for you..."

1989
01:37:37,981 --> 01:37:40,111
"was me fulfilling my role as your mom."

1990
01:37:40,112 --> 01:37:41,681
"I had been so proud of that."

1991
01:37:41,811 --> 01:37:43,850
That's what really breaks my heart.

1992
01:37:43,851 --> 01:37:46,381
I wasn't there for her during the important moments of her life.

1993
01:38:06,202 --> 01:38:08,771
My mom doesn't even have any hobbies.

1994
01:38:13,542 --> 01:38:15,411
Aside from making money...

1995
01:38:15,412 --> 01:38:18,322
to financially support us,

1996
01:38:18,851 --> 01:38:20,051
there's nothing she does for fun.

1997
01:38:22,091 --> 01:38:24,061
And travelling...

1998
01:38:24,162 --> 01:38:26,492
She says she's scared of getting on planes...

1999
01:38:26,992 --> 01:38:30,462
and that she feels the most comfortable at home.

2000
01:38:30,832 --> 01:38:33,462
But to be honest, I think it's just that...

2001
01:38:33,801 --> 01:38:36,832
she's never been taught how to have fun.

2002
01:38:41,171 --> 01:38:44,242
She's lived such a busy life in which...

2003
01:38:44,612 --> 01:38:49,310
she couldn't even think about the next day.

2004
01:38:49,311 --> 01:38:53,752
She couldn't just let go and have fun in her life.

2005
01:38:55,492 --> 01:38:57,050
I guess I thought...

2006
01:38:57,051 --> 01:38:59,822
I had a lot more time with her than I actually did.

2007
01:39:00,192 --> 01:39:02,930
"Someday, I'll get to repay her..."

2008
01:39:02,931 --> 01:39:05,431
"for everything she's done for us."

2009
01:39:06,131 --> 01:39:07,502
that's what I thought...

2010
01:39:07,601 --> 01:39:09,902
as I did what I wanted to do for myself.

2011
01:39:10,502 --> 01:39:14,942
And I felt that it had been very selfish of me.

2012
01:39:15,471 --> 01:39:19,712
"What if I actually don't have that much time?"

2013
01:39:21,981 --> 01:39:25,121
So the reason I decided to...

2014
01:39:25,122 --> 01:39:26,921
come on this show is...

2015
01:39:27,021 --> 01:39:29,390
I can't suddenly get a new job...

2016
01:39:29,391 --> 01:39:34,090
or make a lot more money for her than I currently am.

2017
01:39:34,091 --> 01:39:36,992
Those are not possible for me.

2018
01:39:37,532 --> 01:39:40,201
So if I do something that can...

2019
01:39:40,202 --> 01:39:42,101
make Mom happy right now,

2020
01:39:43,502 --> 01:39:46,042
maybe I'd have fewer regrets.

2021
01:40:02,692 --> 01:40:05,391
I really understand what that feels like.

2022
01:40:06,792 --> 01:40:10,930
I wanted to give her a hug,

2023
01:40:10,931 --> 01:40:12,061
rather than using my words.

2024
01:40:24,681 --> 01:40:27,811
She reminded me of how I was back then.

2025
01:40:30,612 --> 01:40:32,680
Still,

2026
01:40:32,681 --> 01:40:35,691
I thought I would be able to bring some energy into the family...

2027
01:40:35,692 --> 01:40:39,420
and escape depression and worries...

2028
01:40:39,421 --> 01:40:41,662
we felt in the past two years...

2029
01:40:42,362 --> 01:40:45,401
and feel something new.

2030
01:40:45,402 --> 01:40:49,832
That thought gave me the determination to enter the show.

2031
01:40:50,601 --> 01:40:51,670
I fought with my brother back then.

2032
01:40:51,671 --> 01:40:52,840
(I fought with my brother back then.)

2033
01:40:52,841 --> 01:40:56,310
I sent him long text messages...

2034
01:40:56,311 --> 01:40:59,442
about why I decided to enter the show.

2035
01:40:59,612 --> 01:41:01,281
My brother replied right away,

2036
01:41:01,282 --> 01:41:03,581
"I can't enter the show."

2037
01:41:03,582 --> 01:41:05,622
I was so angry...

2038
01:41:05,981 --> 01:41:07,991
that I didn't want to talk to him.

2039
01:41:07,992 --> 01:41:10,051
I just replied, "Fine. Don't enter the show."

2040
01:41:10,521 --> 01:41:11,920
A few days later,

2041
01:41:11,921 --> 01:41:14,591
he said he would attend the meeting.

2042
01:41:14,731 --> 01:41:17,531
I am sure my brother's initial reaction was,

2043
01:41:17,532 --> 01:41:19,230
"A show? That's ridiculous."

2044
01:41:19,231 --> 01:41:21,501
"I am not going to enter a show."

2045
01:41:21,502 --> 01:41:23,470
Then he probably thought about...

2046
01:41:23,471 --> 01:41:26,471
the things I thought about.

2047
01:41:26,902 --> 01:41:28,170
During the process,

2048
01:41:28,171 --> 01:41:31,311
my brother and I talked about many things for the first time.

2049
01:41:31,481 --> 01:41:33,912
I even did my brother's makeup.

2050
01:41:36,881 --> 01:41:40,322
I tapped on his face with a makeup sponge.

2051
01:41:41,992 --> 01:41:44,362
I tapped on his face with a makeup sponge.

2052
01:41:44,721 --> 01:41:49,192
There were funny situations.

2053
01:41:49,631 --> 01:41:51,130
That made me think,

2054
01:41:51,131 --> 01:41:53,761
"This show is fascinating."

2055
01:41:54,061 --> 01:41:56,001
"How do they know our situation so well..."

2056
01:41:56,002 --> 01:42:00,001
"and relieve our pent-up frustration?"

2057
01:42:00,002 --> 01:42:02,841
I had that thought often during preparation.

2058
01:42:02,971 --> 01:42:04,340
Perhaps I got lucky.

2059
01:42:04,341 --> 01:42:06,911
The medicine I chose first suited me perfectly.

2060
01:42:06,912 --> 01:42:09,651
I am getting treated with that medicine.

2061
01:42:09,652 --> 01:42:12,220
My children entering the show...

2062
01:42:12,221 --> 01:42:15,050
and finding someone are the matters of the future.

2063
01:42:15,051 --> 01:42:17,991
I thought, "Which writer discovered..."

2064
01:42:17,992 --> 01:42:20,362
"my dear children?"

2065
01:42:20,462 --> 01:42:23,931
I told my children that I was proud of it.

2066
01:42:24,332 --> 01:42:26,501
When I think about how I was in the past,

2067
01:42:26,502 --> 01:42:29,301
I am really happy right now. I tell my children that.

2068
01:42:40,112 --> 01:42:44,651
Now, I have a lot of friends...

2069
01:42:44,652 --> 01:42:46,782
I can open up to.

2070
01:42:46,952 --> 01:42:49,251
Here, I don't need to pretend...

2071
01:42:49,252 --> 01:42:53,292
to be strong and sturdy.

2072
01:42:54,431 --> 01:42:56,591
I have expectations and relief.

2073
01:42:58,902 --> 01:43:01,430
Ji Won's way of thinking...

2074
01:43:01,431 --> 01:43:03,931
resembles mine.

2075
01:43:04,202 --> 01:43:07,271
I feel like my character exists inside her...

2076
01:43:07,671 --> 01:43:09,711
as a different sex.

2077
01:43:09,712 --> 01:43:12,340
If I were in a similar situation,

2078
01:43:12,341 --> 01:43:13,980
I would have made a similar decision.

2079
01:43:13,981 --> 01:43:16,311
I related to her emotionally.

2080
01:43:16,851 --> 01:43:19,252
It made me know Ji Won more.

2081
01:43:20,782 --> 01:43:21,991
It's nice to meet you.

2082
01:43:21,992 --> 01:43:24,260
- It's nice to meet you. - You must be very nervous.

2083
01:43:24,261 --> 01:43:26,161
- Seriously. - He must be nervous.

2084
01:43:26,162 --> 01:43:27,162
I know.

2085
01:43:27,832 --> 01:43:30,060
Why did you add so much curl?

2086
01:43:30,061 --> 01:43:31,831
- I don't know. - It's so curly.

2087
01:43:31,832 --> 01:43:32,902
Is it curly?

2088
01:43:34,101 --> 01:43:36,902
Gosh, I can call you my big sister now.

2089
01:43:38,171 --> 01:43:40,301
- Jung Sub. - Yun Ha.

2090
01:43:41,712 --> 01:43:43,741
- I wanted to call your name. - Yun Ha,

2091
01:43:43,742 --> 01:43:45,781
it was so frustrating...

2092
01:43:45,782 --> 01:43:47,881
- because I couldn't talk to you. - I know.

2093
01:43:49,381 --> 01:43:51,622
Let's have a hug. All right.

2094
01:43:55,391 --> 01:43:56,391
Let's go.

2095
01:43:56,652 --> 01:43:57,721
Yong Woo, my big brother.

2096
01:43:58,421 --> 01:43:59,621
Am I older than you?

2097
01:43:59,622 --> 01:44:01,161
I don't know your age.

2098
01:44:01,162 --> 01:44:02,992
- You are cool. - Don't be ridiculous.

2099
01:44:03,891 --> 01:44:06,101
- You are the coolest. - Hello.

2100
01:44:06,362 --> 01:44:07,971
- Let's have a hug. - Yong Woo, my big brother.

2101
01:44:10,202 --> 01:44:11,600
There is nothing to worry about now.

2102
01:44:11,601 --> 01:44:13,901
I don't need to call Se Seung like a stranger.

2103
01:44:13,902 --> 01:44:17,141
Se Seung seemed to be at ease.

2104
01:44:17,811 --> 01:44:20,212
Jae Hyung, you were full of cute acts.

2105
01:44:22,311 --> 01:44:24,252
Ji Won, you must have been lonely.

2106
01:44:25,881 --> 01:44:26,921
It's better without me, right?

2107
01:44:27,381 --> 01:44:29,020
Having you here doesn't...

2108
01:44:29,021 --> 01:44:30,151
It doesn't really help, right?

2109
01:44:30,152 --> 01:44:31,322
Seriously.

2110
01:44:32,521 --> 01:44:35,430
"So they were like that ever since they were little."

2111
01:44:35,431 --> 01:44:37,831
It was fun to watch with such thoughts.

2112
01:44:37,832 --> 01:44:39,930
Even to your closest friends,

2113
01:44:39,931 --> 01:44:43,071
you don't get many opportunities...

2114
01:44:43,072 --> 01:44:45,371
to explain everything in detail.

2115
01:44:45,372 --> 01:44:47,541
It was really nice...

2116
01:44:47,542 --> 01:44:50,212
to get to know each other on a deeper level.

2117
01:44:50,542 --> 01:44:54,181
It was a really meaningful time.

2118
01:44:54,381 --> 01:44:56,611
I think we should introduce ourselves again.

2119
01:44:56,612 --> 01:44:58,851
- Including the last name? - Including the last name.

2120
01:44:59,082 --> 01:45:02,191
Hello, I am Ji Won's older brother, Kim Yun Jae.

2121
01:45:02,192 --> 01:45:04,091
I own a private business.

2122
01:45:05,792 --> 01:45:06,792
I see.

2123
01:45:07,091 --> 01:45:08,791
- It's nice to meet you. - It's nice to meet you.

2124
01:45:08,792 --> 01:45:10,962
I am Ju Yeon's older brother.

2125
01:45:11,462 --> 01:45:14,161
My name is Lee Yong Woo. It's nice to meet you.

2126
01:45:14,162 --> 01:45:15,471
- My goodness. - Gosh.

2127
01:45:16,301 --> 01:45:18,600
My name is Park Se Seung.

2128
01:45:18,601 --> 01:45:20,371
I am currently jobless...

2129
01:45:20,372 --> 01:45:22,170
because I quit to prepare for my next job.

2130
01:45:22,171 --> 01:45:24,380
My name is Park Cheol Hyeon.

2131
01:45:24,381 --> 01:45:26,541
I am Cho A's younger brother.

2132
01:45:26,542 --> 01:45:28,811
I work as a model.

2133
01:45:29,011 --> 01:45:31,752
I am Jung Sub's older sister, Lee Yun Ha.

2134
01:45:31,921 --> 01:45:33,622
I am a cellist.

2135
01:45:34,652 --> 01:45:36,452
I am your younger sister.

2136
01:45:38,492 --> 01:45:39,492
Jung Sub.

2137
01:45:39,761 --> 01:45:43,931
I am Yun Ha's younger brother, Lee Jung Sub.

2138
01:45:43,962 --> 01:45:46,362
I am an AI researcher.

2139
01:45:46,502 --> 01:45:49,201
I am Cheol Hyeon's sister.

2140
01:45:49,202 --> 01:45:51,441
My name is Park Cho A.

2141
01:45:51,442 --> 01:45:54,711
I work as a diet consultant.

2142
01:45:54,712 --> 01:45:58,011
I am Se Seung's older brother, Park Jae Hyung.

2143
01:45:58,141 --> 01:45:59,712
I work as an accountant.

2144
01:46:00,141 --> 01:46:02,810
I am Lee Yong Woo's sister, who is nine years younger than him.

2145
01:46:02,811 --> 01:46:05,551
- Nine years. - My name is Lee Ju Yeon.

2146
01:46:08,192 --> 01:46:10,591
- There is a big age difference. - I know.

2147
01:46:11,261 --> 01:46:12,661
I bet she was so cute.

2148
01:46:12,662 --> 01:46:14,691
- I know. I bet she was so pretty. - Seriously.

2149
01:46:14,692 --> 01:46:15,891
She must have been so pretty.

2150
01:46:16,162 --> 01:46:17,461
There was a reason why...

2151
01:46:17,462 --> 01:46:19,730
Yong Woo seemed so mature.

2152
01:46:19,731 --> 01:46:21,431
- That's right. I get it now. - That's right.

2153
01:46:22,332 --> 01:46:23,930
I feel closer to everyone.

2154
01:46:23,931 --> 01:46:25,671
- I know. - Much closer.

2155
01:46:26,402 --> 01:46:29,170
The biggest secret was out,

2156
01:46:29,171 --> 01:46:31,640
so I could get the three-dimensional picture.

2157
01:46:31,641 --> 01:46:33,010
Thanks to the things...

2158
01:46:33,011 --> 01:46:35,152
we could relate to and share,

2159
01:46:35,252 --> 01:46:36,550
we became comfortable around each other.

2160
01:46:36,551 --> 01:46:38,951
On the other hand, the revealed secret...

2161
01:46:38,952 --> 01:46:40,751
made me act differently...

2162
01:46:40,752 --> 01:46:43,421
to the sibling of the person I am attracted to.

2163
01:46:43,822 --> 01:46:47,931
I can't help but become more cautious.

2164
01:46:53,362 --> 01:46:55,071
(A letter arrives.)

2165
01:46:55,072 --> 01:46:56,072
We received something.

2166
01:46:56,073 --> 01:46:57,840
- Yun Ha, please read it. - Please read it.

2167
01:46:57,841 --> 01:46:59,170
Maybe the newcomer should read it.

2168
01:46:59,171 --> 01:47:00,801
The newcomer should read it.

2169
01:47:00,971 --> 01:47:01,971
Okay.

2170
01:47:02,311 --> 01:47:03,770
It feels like hazing.

2171
01:47:03,771 --> 01:47:05,441
We can test which group he is in.

2172
01:47:05,442 --> 01:47:07,680
We are divided into two groups.

2173
01:47:07,681 --> 01:47:08,711
- Really? - Yes.

2174
01:47:08,712 --> 01:47:11,152
- There are a small, elite group... - Okay.

2175
01:47:11,421 --> 01:47:13,181
- and a big group. - Let's see what happens.

2176
01:47:16,221 --> 01:47:17,390
Should I read it out loud?

2177
01:47:17,391 --> 01:47:18,520
- Yes. - He is shaking.

2178
01:47:18,521 --> 01:47:21,060
- I am so nervous. - Please read it loudly.

2179
01:47:21,061 --> 01:47:23,931
"There are songs the parents want their children to listen to."

2180
01:47:24,332 --> 01:47:27,832
"Female participants will choose the cards for their siblings..."

2181
01:47:28,101 --> 01:47:31,641
"and have them go on a date with women whose names are on them."

2182
01:47:31,702 --> 01:47:34,270
"Open the cards and check the names before choosing."

2183
01:47:34,271 --> 01:47:35,810
"Please choose now."

2184
01:47:35,811 --> 01:47:37,041
(Female participants will choose the cards for their siblings...)

2185
01:47:37,042 --> 01:47:38,282
(and have them go on a date with women whose names are on them.)

2186
01:47:39,381 --> 01:47:41,310
What? Hold on.

2187
01:47:41,311 --> 01:47:43,050
I will need to join the small group.

2188
01:47:43,051 --> 01:47:44,180
Please read it again.

2189
01:47:44,181 --> 01:47:45,921
Everyone, line up.

2190
01:47:46,252 --> 01:47:48,220
- Me. I didn't understand. - Me.

2191
01:47:48,221 --> 01:47:50,292
Why am I becoming more like them?

2192
01:47:50,721 --> 01:47:52,462
It's the first time I didn't understand the letter.

2193
01:47:53,391 --> 01:47:55,730
So women choose the cards today.

2194
01:47:55,731 --> 01:47:57,831
- Are there more cards? - They are here.

2195
01:47:57,832 --> 01:48:00,060
- So I think... - Yes.

2196
01:48:00,061 --> 01:48:01,130
(Five song cards came with the letter.)

2197
01:48:01,131 --> 01:48:04,542
(There are siblings' names and the parents' song recommendations.)

2198
01:48:04,601 --> 01:48:08,911
So women are choosing their siblings' dates.

2199
01:48:08,912 --> 01:48:11,310
So women choose.

2200
01:48:11,311 --> 01:48:14,181
We need to choose openly.

2201
01:48:14,481 --> 01:48:17,252
(They decide on the order for choosing the song cards.)

2202
01:48:17,822 --> 01:48:19,850
Shall we choose the fair method and play...

2203
01:48:19,851 --> 01:48:20,920
- rock-paper-scissors? - Rock-paper-scissors.

2204
01:48:20,921 --> 01:48:23,152
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

2205
01:48:23,391 --> 01:48:24,661
(Se Seung will choose last.)

2206
01:48:24,662 --> 01:48:26,591
- You will choose last. - Sorry, my brother.

2207
01:48:27,721 --> 01:48:29,492
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

2208
01:48:29,662 --> 01:48:30,891
- First. - First.

2209
01:48:31,061 --> 01:48:32,131
Second.

2210
01:48:32,261 --> 01:48:33,902
Third, fourth, and fifth.

2211
01:48:34,931 --> 01:48:37,402
(Since Ji Won won, she chooses the card first.)

2212
01:48:39,271 --> 01:48:41,970
"Have them go on a date."

2213
01:48:41,971 --> 01:48:44,441
As I talked to women,

2214
01:48:44,442 --> 01:48:46,741
I always thought,

2215
01:48:46,742 --> 01:48:48,811
"Would she make a good pair with my sibling?"

2216
01:48:48,912 --> 01:48:52,980
I had already made up my mind.

2217
01:48:52,981 --> 01:48:54,992
- Really? Who is it? - Who is it?

2218
01:48:55,051 --> 01:48:56,721
- Who is it? - Who is it?

2219
01:48:56,822 --> 01:48:59,992
Despite all the bickering, she thinks about her brother.

2220
01:49:01,021 --> 01:49:02,560
(She chooses without hesitation.)

2221
01:49:02,561 --> 01:49:04,331
So this happened.

2222
01:49:04,332 --> 01:49:05,862
Why is this nerve-racking?

2223
01:49:06,032 --> 01:49:08,702
I won't hesitate.

2224
01:49:10,671 --> 01:49:12,170
- You won't hesitate. - No.

2225
01:49:12,171 --> 01:49:14,871
Jung Sub didn't receive any messages yesterday.

2226
01:49:14,872 --> 01:49:17,311
I was determined to send him on a nice date.

2227
01:49:17,841 --> 01:49:19,181
This is hard.

2228
01:49:19,742 --> 01:49:22,411
I wanted my brother to go on a date...

2229
01:49:22,412 --> 01:49:25,021
with either Cho A or Se Seung.

2230
01:49:25,881 --> 01:49:27,452
I will choose this one.

2231
01:49:27,921 --> 01:49:29,221
You like the song, right?

2232
01:49:29,351 --> 01:49:30,851
You would like such songs.

2233
01:49:32,492 --> 01:49:35,461
I made a decision with the hope...

2234
01:49:35,462 --> 01:49:36,731
of helping him.

2235
01:49:40,832 --> 01:49:42,470
- Okay. - Okay.

2236
01:49:42,471 --> 01:49:44,971
- Excuse me, Jung Sub. - Okay.

2237
01:49:46,641 --> 01:49:48,211
Ju Yeon, take this.

2238
01:49:48,212 --> 01:49:50,372
Okay, Yong Woo.

2239
01:49:53,511 --> 01:49:54,582
Thank you.

2240
01:49:55,511 --> 01:49:58,381
(The male participants received the cards.)

2241
01:49:58,681 --> 01:50:00,822
Can we... Can we look inside?

2242
01:50:01,752 --> 01:50:05,492
(Jung Sub checks the card first.)

2243
01:50:08,061 --> 01:50:09,391
Hold on. What is this?

2244
01:50:13,032 --> 01:50:14,301
I see.

2245
01:50:18,072 --> 01:50:19,101
As for me,

2246
01:50:20,202 --> 01:50:23,412
the song is "My Love by My Side."

2247
01:50:24,311 --> 01:50:27,141
My date is Jae Hyung's sister, Se Seung.

2248
01:50:27,242 --> 01:50:28,281
I was relieved.

2249
01:50:28,282 --> 01:50:31,281
I was matched with the person I wanted.

2250
01:50:31,282 --> 01:50:34,480
When I received the card, I felt...

2251
01:50:34,481 --> 01:50:35,791
comfortable.

2252
01:50:35,792 --> 01:50:37,151
It seemed like...

2253
01:50:37,152 --> 01:50:41,430
he had a good time with Se Seung.

2254
01:50:41,431 --> 01:50:44,930
I thought he might feel something different...

2255
01:50:44,931 --> 01:50:46,631
on the second date.

2256
01:50:46,832 --> 01:50:50,101
"Back then, the Pickax Dance entranced Mom and..."

2257
01:50:51,402 --> 01:50:53,242
The sentence ends like that.

2258
01:50:53,601 --> 01:50:55,411
- What's the Pickax Dance? - The Pickax Dance.

2259
01:50:55,412 --> 01:50:56,441
I don't know.

2260
01:50:56,442 --> 01:50:58,241
- I don't know either. - Who knows the dance?

2261
01:50:58,242 --> 01:50:59,941
- I don't know. - I guess it was sealed off...

2262
01:50:59,942 --> 01:51:01,041
after that day.

2263
01:51:01,042 --> 01:51:03,152
- I don't know what it was. - Mom sealed it off.

2264
01:51:03,582 --> 01:51:06,752
(Yong Woo checks the card.)

2265
01:51:09,992 --> 01:51:11,662
("I'm Not Alone" by Suh Young Eun)

2266
01:51:14,162 --> 01:51:17,931
If I mishear this person's name, it's "Jo A."

2267
01:51:20,202 --> 01:51:21,231
Cho A.

2268
01:51:23,872 --> 01:51:27,441
I talked to Ju Yeon briefly before going to Gangwon Province.

2269
01:51:27,442 --> 01:51:30,741
I thought she might pick the person who came up in our conversation.

2270
01:51:30,742 --> 01:51:34,711
Their relationship seemed to be strong,

2271
01:51:34,712 --> 01:51:36,152
so I chose Cho A.

2272
01:51:37,181 --> 01:51:39,851
(Ju Yeon's selection led to a date between Yong Woo and Cho A.)

2273
01:51:41,952 --> 01:51:44,921
(Jae Hyung checks the card.)

2274
01:51:45,962 --> 01:51:47,091
My date is...

2275
01:51:50,962 --> 01:51:54,061
Yong Woo's younger sister, Ju Yeon.

2276
01:51:55,731 --> 01:51:57,770
The date will be fun.

2277
01:51:57,771 --> 01:52:00,170
Can we enjoy the date all day long?

2278
01:52:00,171 --> 01:52:01,771
I don't have work tomorrow.

2279
01:52:01,971 --> 01:52:03,441
I want to go and eat meat with her.

2280
01:52:03,442 --> 01:52:07,412
She told me confidently that meat was her favourite food.

2281
01:52:08,112 --> 01:52:10,912
(Jae Hyung and Ju Yeon will go on a date.)

2282
01:52:11,521 --> 01:52:13,951
- It's the way Mom talks. - Seriously. The ellipsis.

2283
01:52:13,952 --> 01:52:15,521
"I remember..."

2284
01:52:17,152 --> 01:52:19,362
(Yun Jae checks the card.)

2285
01:52:20,391 --> 01:52:22,692
(Stifling her laughter)

2286
01:52:23,792 --> 01:52:25,502
(Grinning)

2287
01:52:26,832 --> 01:52:28,971
I don't know this song very well.

2288
01:52:33,141 --> 01:52:34,840
- My date is Jung Sub's... - Older sister.

2289
01:52:34,841 --> 01:52:36,912
Older sister, Yun Ha.

2290
01:52:40,412 --> 01:52:42,381
I thought about it continuously.

2291
01:52:42,582 --> 01:52:46,180
"If I ever get a chance,"

2292
01:52:46,181 --> 01:52:48,322
"I will choose Yun Ha."

2293
01:52:48,622 --> 01:52:51,890
When I opened the card, I saw Yun Ha's name.

2294
01:52:51,891 --> 01:52:56,661
JI Won probably thought she would be a good fit...

2295
01:52:56,662 --> 01:52:57,931
for me.

2296
01:52:58,061 --> 01:52:59,101
I liked it.

2297
01:52:59,202 --> 01:53:02,201
He was new, so I became curious.

2298
01:53:02,202 --> 01:53:05,401
He has a high nose bridge.

2299
01:53:05,402 --> 01:53:07,542
I think I like men with a nice-looking nose.

2300
01:53:07,742 --> 01:53:11,372
He is my ideal type in terms of looks.

2301
01:53:11,742 --> 01:53:14,141
(She will go on a date with a man with a high nose bridge.)

2302
01:53:14,851 --> 01:53:17,051
(Cheol Hyeon checks the card.)

2303
01:53:20,681 --> 01:53:23,591
"Born Again" by Kim Don Kyoo.

2304
01:53:24,122 --> 01:53:25,161
Ji Won.

2305
01:53:25,162 --> 01:53:27,020
(Cheol Hyeon's date, Ji Won)

2306
01:53:27,021 --> 01:53:29,390
Just like me,

2307
01:53:29,391 --> 01:53:33,800
Cheol Hyeon is someone who can understand Ji Won the most.

2308
01:53:33,801 --> 01:53:39,270
I knew that Cheol Hyeon had an interest in Ji Won.

2309
01:53:39,271 --> 01:53:40,670
I liked it. I was curious about her.

2310
01:53:40,671 --> 01:53:42,640
I wanted to talk to her more.

2311
01:53:42,641 --> 01:53:44,271
Is this the song?

2312
01:53:44,641 --> 01:53:46,442
I was wondering why this song was playing.

2313
01:53:47,181 --> 01:53:48,680
- It's Mom's ringtone. - As soon as I heard it,

2314
01:53:48,681 --> 01:53:50,180
I said it was Mom's ringtone.

2315
01:53:50,181 --> 01:53:52,822
- Shall we clink our glasses? - Cheers.

2316
01:53:53,082 --> 01:53:54,082
Cheers.

2317
01:53:54,083 --> 01:53:55,621
Please give me a glass of beer.

2318
01:53:55,622 --> 01:53:57,051
Here comes another letter.

2319
01:53:57,252 --> 01:53:59,662
- We are getting many letters. - We are getting many letters today.

2320
01:54:04,561 --> 01:54:06,332
(Grinning)

2321
01:54:07,202 --> 01:54:08,730
- I will read it. - Okay.

2322
01:54:08,731 --> 01:54:11,401
- Okay. - "The last participant to join,"

2323
01:54:11,402 --> 01:54:14,071
"Yun Jae can go on one more date."

2324
01:54:14,072 --> 01:54:17,811
"Yesterday, Yun Jae chose the person he wanted to go on a date with."

2325
01:54:18,282 --> 01:54:21,681
"Please say the name of the chosen person."

2326
01:54:22,811 --> 01:54:24,921
- How did he choose? - How did he do that?

2327
01:54:25,221 --> 01:54:26,582
How did he know about us?

2328
01:54:27,252 --> 01:54:29,492
- Who is it? - I...

2329
01:54:30,391 --> 01:54:32,822
(Last night)

2330
01:54:33,322 --> 01:54:35,862
(Yun Jae received a mission.)

2331
01:54:36,332 --> 01:54:39,261
(He delivered meat to the woman he liked.)

2332
01:54:39,801 --> 01:54:42,970
(Yun Jae's choice, )

2333
01:54:42,971 --> 01:54:45,572
(Yun Ha)

2334
01:54:47,101 --> 01:54:49,372
- Who is it? - I...

2335
01:54:55,782 --> 01:54:58,252
I chose Yun Ha.

2336
01:55:01,381 --> 01:55:02,551
I chose Yun Ha.

2337
01:55:04,122 --> 01:55:05,122
Yun Ha?

2338
01:55:05,492 --> 01:55:06,921
It's fate.

2339
01:55:08,021 --> 01:55:09,962
To be honest, my heart fluttered a lot.

2340
01:55:10,332 --> 01:55:12,561
How did this happen?

2341
01:55:13,462 --> 01:55:15,271
Is it possible?

2342
01:55:15,572 --> 01:55:17,371
So you will go on two dates with Yun Ha.

2343
01:55:17,372 --> 01:55:18,572
My goodness.

2344
01:55:18,902 --> 01:55:20,372
Why did you say "My goodness?"

2345
01:55:21,271 --> 01:55:22,942
- My goodness. - I...

2346
01:55:23,372 --> 01:55:25,041
It's really fascinating...

2347
01:55:25,042 --> 01:55:27,811
- that she knows his brother's type. - Seriously.

2348
01:55:28,311 --> 01:55:31,181
I thought, "I know him pretty well."

2349
01:55:31,511 --> 01:55:32,681
- We can say it. - Yes.

2350
01:55:33,181 --> 01:55:35,091
I was surprised because we chose the same.

2351
01:55:35,221 --> 01:55:37,951
"She knows me very well."

2352
01:55:37,952 --> 01:55:39,791
I had that thought.

2353
01:55:39,792 --> 01:55:41,321
Judging by my brother's personality,

2354
01:55:41,322 --> 01:55:44,090
I thought it would be good for him...

2355
01:55:44,091 --> 01:55:45,661
to go on two dates with the same person.

2356
01:55:45,662 --> 01:55:47,600
So I thought, "This is nice."

2357
01:55:47,601 --> 01:55:51,332
It would be advantageous for him to go on two dates with her.

2358
01:55:52,202 --> 01:55:54,100
It's nice.

2359
01:55:54,101 --> 01:55:57,270
(She will go on two dates with a man with a high nose bridge.)

2360
01:55:57,271 --> 01:55:59,211
Can you tell us how...

2361
01:55:59,212 --> 01:56:00,810
- you chose her? - Right. Give us the reasons.

2362
01:56:00,811 --> 01:56:01,850
I am curious.

2363
01:56:01,851 --> 01:56:05,781
Yesterday, all of you ate at our restaurant.

2364
01:56:05,782 --> 01:56:07,221
- What? - What?

2365
01:56:07,851 --> 01:56:10,151
- Where did we go yesterday? - What did we eat?

2366
01:56:10,152 --> 01:56:11,591
- Pork belly. - Yes.

2367
01:56:12,591 --> 01:56:13,622
Really?

2368
01:56:14,192 --> 01:56:16,162
- Really? - Really?

2369
01:56:18,362 --> 01:56:21,261
- Really? Was that the restaurant? - Really?

2370
01:56:21,502 --> 01:56:22,872
- That's right. - That's incredible.

2371
01:56:23,072 --> 01:56:25,800
He chose my sister based on the first impression.

2372
01:56:25,801 --> 01:56:30,071
Yun Jae seemed like someone intuitive.

2373
01:56:30,072 --> 01:56:32,911
And both siblings chose my sister.

2374
01:56:32,912 --> 01:56:36,810
The double choice...

2375
01:56:36,811 --> 01:56:38,181
made me happy.

2376
01:56:38,421 --> 01:56:40,220
That restaurant has tasty food.

2377
01:56:40,221 --> 01:56:42,691
- We enjoyed the food so much. - We had a good meal.

2378
01:56:42,692 --> 01:56:44,621
- I see. - It was my brother's restaurant.

2379
01:56:44,622 --> 01:56:45,791
I see.

2380
01:56:45,792 --> 01:56:48,930
- He did look very comfortable. - Really?

2381
01:56:48,931 --> 01:56:51,192
- He acted. - He wore a cap and looked down.

2382
01:56:52,002 --> 01:56:54,300
It must have been funny when I grilled beef brisket.

2383
01:56:54,301 --> 01:56:55,401
(He did struggle a bit.)

2384
01:56:55,402 --> 01:56:56,532
No.

2385
01:56:57,801 --> 01:56:59,640
The two of you don't resemble each other.

2386
01:56:59,641 --> 01:57:02,441
Ji Won takes after Dad and I take after Mom.

2387
01:57:02,442 --> 01:57:05,542
The two of you get along, right?

2388
01:57:05,582 --> 01:57:07,211
I think we get along now.

2389
01:57:07,212 --> 01:57:09,951
The one on his left is the only person he can depend on.

2390
01:57:09,952 --> 01:57:12,020
- He has no choice. - He has no choice.

2391
01:57:12,021 --> 01:57:13,520
We don't have a relationship...

2392
01:57:13,521 --> 01:57:14,981
- that is very close and warm. - I see.

2393
01:57:15,652 --> 01:57:17,591
It's because you guys are only a year apart.

2394
01:57:18,221 --> 01:57:21,492
- Yong Woo, what do you think... - What?

2395
01:57:22,192 --> 01:57:27,301
(On the 9th day, who made your heart flutter?)

2396
01:57:28,162 --> 01:57:30,072
The difficult time is back.

2397
01:57:36,171 --> 01:57:38,111
I gave it much thought.

2398
01:57:38,112 --> 01:57:42,381
I became a bit cautious.

2399
01:57:50,792 --> 01:57:52,292
I sent it to Jae Hyung.

2400
01:57:52,662 --> 01:57:55,561
"Thank you for looking after me when I cried."

2401
01:58:01,561 --> 01:58:03,571
I thought about it a lot.

2402
01:58:03,572 --> 01:58:05,942
I am not certain yet.

2403
01:58:13,582 --> 01:58:16,752
(After much thought, they deliver their feelings.)

2404
01:58:16,912 --> 01:58:19,350
- What's your MBTI? - That's right.

2405
01:58:19,351 --> 01:58:20,551
It's ENTJ.

2406
01:58:21,152 --> 01:58:22,850
- That's insane. - I can't believe it.

2407
01:58:22,851 --> 01:58:24,321
All of us are ENTJ.

2408
01:58:24,322 --> 01:58:26,321
- How did that happen? - It's so fascinating.

2409
01:58:26,322 --> 01:58:27,591
It's so fascinating.

2410
01:58:30,292 --> 01:58:32,832
(Let's have a fun date!)

2411
01:58:36,372 --> 01:58:38,942
It was Se Seung. Since we got matched for a date,

2412
01:58:39,141 --> 01:58:42,341
she wrote, "Let's have a fun date!"

2413
01:58:43,271 --> 01:58:44,372
It made me feel good.

2414
01:58:45,782 --> 01:58:48,651
Jung Sub was the only one I could message.

2415
01:58:48,652 --> 01:58:51,381
I didn't know how Jung Sub felt.

2416
01:58:51,921 --> 01:58:54,850
I didn't want to pressure him,

2417
01:58:54,851 --> 01:58:57,051
so I kept the message simple.

2418
01:59:00,021 --> 01:59:03,291
I feel like I haven't seen him in a long while.

2419
01:59:03,292 --> 01:59:05,600
"What if Jung Sub doesn't send me a message?"

2420
01:59:05,601 --> 01:59:07,561
I couldn't help but be calculative.

2421
01:59:13,372 --> 01:59:15,140
(I see the similarities.)

2422
01:59:15,141 --> 01:59:16,912
(Now that I have seen your family, you don't seem like a stranger.)

2423
01:59:17,242 --> 01:59:19,140
Because of the style of speech,

2424
01:59:19,141 --> 01:59:21,712
I was like, "Who sent it?"

2425
01:59:21,881 --> 01:59:24,981
I think it's Jung Sub. It has to be Jung Sub.

2426
01:59:27,181 --> 01:59:30,451
(Jung Sub chose your sibling.)

2427
01:59:30,452 --> 01:59:32,822
(The message changed.)

2428
01:59:32,891 --> 01:59:36,091
- They get all the information now. - They know who sent the message.

2429
01:59:36,561 --> 01:59:38,191
They might not like it.

2430
01:59:38,192 --> 01:59:40,031
Now, it's the real-name system.

2431
01:59:40,032 --> 01:59:42,600
- "Why do they go back and forth?" - That's right.

2432
01:59:42,601 --> 01:59:45,872
(Jung Sub chose your sibling.)

2433
01:59:49,141 --> 01:59:53,081
I got the name of the person who chose my sibling.

2434
01:59:53,082 --> 01:59:56,380
Jung Sub chose my sibling.

2435
01:59:56,381 --> 01:59:59,282
Se Seung didn't get any messages the day before,

2436
01:59:59,652 --> 02:00:03,122
so I kept an eye on her.

2437
02:00:03,421 --> 02:00:06,621
Since I got matched to Se Seung,

2438
02:00:06,622 --> 02:00:08,421
I sent her a message.

2439
02:00:10,162 --> 02:00:13,061
(The two of them chose each other.)

2440
02:00:14,832 --> 02:00:18,872
(Ju Yeon chose your sibling.)

2441
02:00:19,902 --> 02:00:21,941
- Why? Are you excited? - What?

2442
02:00:21,942 --> 02:00:24,412
- Are you excited? - It's interesting. You will see.

2443
02:00:25,641 --> 02:00:27,582
- What could it be? - What could it be?

2444
02:00:29,481 --> 02:00:31,050
It was so much fun.

2445
02:00:31,051 --> 02:00:33,420
I knew about it, but seeing it with my eyes...

2446
02:00:33,421 --> 02:00:35,252
made me feel proud.

2447
02:00:35,752 --> 02:00:37,951
I do want to be...

2448
02:00:37,952 --> 02:00:41,122
on Yun Ha's good side.

2449
02:00:41,421 --> 02:00:42,931
I don't want her to disapprove of me.

2450
02:00:43,261 --> 02:00:45,192
I want her to think fondly of me.

2451
02:00:45,532 --> 02:00:47,100
And to be honest,

2452
02:00:47,101 --> 02:00:49,771
there is a lot of information I want to get from Yun Ha.

2453
02:00:50,502 --> 02:00:51,971
I am sure Ju Yeon feels the same.

2454
02:00:58,171 --> 02:00:59,840
(Thank you for looking after me on our way here.)

2455
02:00:59,841 --> 02:01:01,510
(Thank you for looking after me when I cried.)

2456
02:01:01,511 --> 02:01:03,581
"Thank you for looking after me when I cried."

2457
02:01:03,582 --> 02:01:05,051
She sat next to me.

2458
02:01:05,551 --> 02:01:09,292
Since she was crying, I gave her tissue paper.

2459
02:01:15,362 --> 02:01:18,261
(Let's have a fun date.)

2460
02:01:20,162 --> 02:01:22,501
(Cho A chose your sibling.)

2461
02:01:22,502 --> 02:01:24,731
Really? Was it like that?

2462
02:01:25,671 --> 02:01:26,742
What changed?

2463
02:01:27,202 --> 02:01:28,242
The message changed.

2464
02:01:28,442 --> 02:01:29,442
The message.

2465
02:01:29,442 --> 02:01:30,442
Seriously.

2466
02:01:36,051 --> 02:01:38,411
I had a hunch about it.

2467
02:01:38,412 --> 02:01:40,752
But when I saw it in text,

2468
02:01:40,851 --> 02:01:43,992
I was like, "What's going on?"

2469
02:01:46,862 --> 02:01:50,130
(What will come after tied hair and untied hair?)

2470
02:01:50,131 --> 02:01:51,930
- What is up with the message? - Yong Woo.

2471
02:01:51,931 --> 02:01:52,961
"Tied hair..."

2472
02:01:52,962 --> 02:01:55,532
They should reveal the message later on.

2473
02:01:55,631 --> 02:01:57,930
"What will come after tied hair and untied hair?"

2474
02:01:57,931 --> 02:01:58,942
No hair.

2475
02:01:59,902 --> 02:02:02,511
(Yong Woo chose your sibling.)

2476
02:02:02,641 --> 02:02:05,881
It was nice. I was happy that Yong Woo chose my sister.

2477
02:02:05,981 --> 02:02:08,310
I can't see what they talk about...

2478
02:02:08,311 --> 02:02:11,011
and what kind of vibe they have when they are together.

2479
02:02:11,112 --> 02:02:12,381
I am curious.

2480
02:02:12,481 --> 02:02:14,751
I had no idea who was sending all the messages to her.

2481
02:02:14,752 --> 02:02:16,091
If it were Yong Woo,

2482
02:02:16,192 --> 02:02:18,452
it would be a plot twist.

2483
02:02:18,862 --> 02:02:20,760
I just laughed.

2484
02:02:20,761 --> 02:02:23,492
Then I thought about how to style my hair.

2485
02:02:23,761 --> 02:02:25,902
I wondered if I should show him a different hairstyle.

2486
02:02:26,402 --> 02:02:30,002
(They sent each other a message today as well.)

2487
02:02:32,542 --> 02:02:34,371
(Let us make a lot of happy and fun memories...)

2488
02:02:34,372 --> 02:02:36,242
(with good people during the remaining time.)

2489
02:02:36,912 --> 02:02:39,641
I sent Cheol Hyeon a message.

2490
02:02:40,341 --> 02:02:43,282
We seemed to have things in common.

2491
02:02:43,612 --> 02:02:46,351
"Let us have a happy time with good people..."

2492
02:02:46,452 --> 02:02:48,082
"during our time here."

2493
02:02:48,181 --> 02:02:52,061
I wanted to send him a message of understanding and consolation.

2494
02:02:52,962 --> 02:02:54,261
"Us?"

2495
02:02:54,692 --> 02:02:56,760
I didn't pay much attention...

2496
02:02:56,761 --> 02:02:58,532
to the words that followed "Us."

2497
02:02:58,962 --> 02:03:01,032
Doesn't "Us" hold...

2498
02:03:03,231 --> 02:03:04,271
a lot of meaning?

2499
02:03:04,372 --> 02:03:07,271
"What could this mean?" I had that thought.

2500
02:03:09,811 --> 02:03:11,340
(The conversation we had when everyone else was asleep...)

2501
02:03:11,341 --> 02:03:12,810
(and the current moments brought us closer.)

2502
02:03:12,811 --> 02:03:16,011
I think Cheol Hyeon sent the message.

2503
02:03:16,212 --> 02:03:20,481
I think he was happy that we got to know each other better.

2504
02:03:20,582 --> 02:03:22,890
"The conversation we had at night when everyone else was asleep..."

2505
02:03:22,891 --> 02:03:24,292
"was memorable."

2506
02:03:24,891 --> 02:03:27,090
"I think it brought us closer."

2507
02:03:27,091 --> 02:03:28,221
I sent her a message along those lines.

2508
02:03:28,962 --> 02:03:31,931
(Cheol Hyeon and Ji Won messaged each other.)

2509
02:03:33,431 --> 02:03:34,461
(Cheol Hyeon chose your sibling.)

2510
02:03:34,462 --> 02:03:36,502
- That's right. - In that case...

2511
02:03:37,572 --> 02:03:39,542
"Thank goodness she didn't receive zero votes."

2512
02:03:39,702 --> 02:03:41,341
I was relieved.

2513
02:03:41,742 --> 02:03:42,742
Before I joined,

2514
02:03:42,811 --> 02:03:45,641
I thought, "I will tease her if she receives zero votes."

2515
02:03:46,011 --> 02:03:47,511
But receiving the message...

2516
02:03:47,612 --> 02:03:51,412
made me realize that I wouldn't be able to tease her.

2517
02:03:54,152 --> 02:03:56,591
(I just had a good feeling about you since yesterday.)

2518
02:03:57,351 --> 02:04:00,521
(Yun Jae chose your sibling.)

2519
02:04:01,061 --> 02:04:04,032
It was strange. It was my first time meeting Yun Jae,

2520
02:04:04,131 --> 02:04:06,902
but my feeling of closeness...

2521
02:04:07,332 --> 02:04:09,171
increased drastically.

2522
02:04:09,502 --> 02:04:12,572
She was smiling when I entered.

2523
02:04:13,072 --> 02:04:16,341
I had a good feeling about her when she smiled.

2524
02:04:17,011 --> 02:04:19,511
It made my heart flutter once more.

2525
02:04:20,181 --> 02:04:22,751
"Could something like this happen to me?"

2526
02:04:22,752 --> 02:04:26,822
I thought about it repeatedly.

2527
02:04:27,381 --> 02:04:30,622
(Yun Jae chose Yun Ha today as well.)

2528
02:04:31,452 --> 02:04:35,122
Cho A would get approved by any in-laws.

2529
02:04:35,221 --> 02:04:37,331
Cho A is the only one who is introverted.

2530
02:04:37,332 --> 02:04:38,332
That's right.

2531
02:04:38,333 --> 02:04:40,461
Things must have been a bit hard.

2532
02:04:40,462 --> 02:04:44,100
But you adjusted better than I expected.

2533
02:04:44,101 --> 02:04:47,401
I have fun. Since I was joined by good people,

2534
02:04:47,402 --> 02:04:49,811
I became determined to do well.

2535
02:04:50,641 --> 02:04:53,712
(Let's have a good date tomorrow.)

2536
02:04:54,582 --> 02:04:57,011
Jae Hyung is very good at using emoticons.

2537
02:04:57,582 --> 02:04:58,712
It was cute.

2538
02:04:58,822 --> 02:05:00,881
He sent the emoticon since I cried.

2539
02:05:01,622 --> 02:05:03,292
I sent Ju Yeon a message.

2540
02:05:03,721 --> 02:05:05,122
The emoticon represented the puffy eyes.

2541
02:05:05,221 --> 02:05:06,921
When I sent the messages,

2542
02:05:07,021 --> 02:05:09,731
I used the emoticons a few times.

2543
02:05:09,832 --> 02:05:10,931
It's something I do.

2544
02:05:12,332 --> 02:05:15,362
I think I am beginning to develop...

2545
02:05:15,702 --> 02:05:17,572
a liking.

2546
02:05:18,572 --> 02:05:21,271
I am definitely going in that direction,

2547
02:05:21,572 --> 02:05:23,412
but I am uncertain...

2548
02:05:23,511 --> 02:05:26,481
about the speed and intensity.

2549
02:05:26,782 --> 02:05:28,581
I am not sure...

2550
02:05:28,582 --> 02:05:31,181
if I actually see her as a woman I would like to date.

2551
02:05:31,481 --> 02:05:32,920
- Don't you need to send one? - What?

2552
02:05:32,921 --> 02:05:34,121
Don't you need to send one?

2553
02:05:34,122 --> 02:05:35,520
I sent it.

2554
02:05:35,521 --> 02:05:36,521
- Did you? - Yes.

2555
02:05:40,662 --> 02:05:43,061
(Welcome to the show.)

2556
02:05:43,761 --> 02:05:45,261
I don't know what's happening.

2557
02:05:50,402 --> 02:05:53,002
To be honest, I don't know who sent the message.

2558
02:05:53,242 --> 02:05:54,242
(Did you expect to receive 0 votes?)

2559
02:05:54,243 --> 02:05:57,912
I was 120 percent sure that I would receive 0 votes.

2560
02:05:58,011 --> 02:06:00,542
So I felt very relieved.

2561
02:06:01,511 --> 02:06:04,381
(Yun Ha chose your sibling.)

2562
02:06:09,221 --> 02:06:11,921
I almost cheered loudly.

2563
02:06:12,421 --> 02:06:13,662
It was better than receiving a message myself.

2564
02:06:14,591 --> 02:06:16,832
I was like, "From the first day?"

2565
02:06:17,391 --> 02:06:19,601
It was so nice. I was so happy.

2566
02:06:20,032 --> 02:06:21,162
(Were you worried about your sibling?)

2567
02:06:21,261 --> 02:06:22,271
A little bit.

2568
02:06:23,731 --> 02:06:26,001
I thought that he might not get any messages at first.

2569
02:06:26,002 --> 02:06:28,971
I worried that he would become dispirited.

2570
02:06:29,372 --> 02:06:32,341
I am happy that he adjusted quickly.

2571
02:06:35,811 --> 02:06:36,952
It's so fascinating.

2572
02:06:39,322 --> 02:06:42,920
As a thank you to the man...

2573
02:06:42,921 --> 02:06:46,792
who made my heart flutter, I welcomed him to the show.

2574
02:06:47,822 --> 02:06:50,692
(The recipient doesn't know it, but she delivered her feelings.)

2575
02:06:54,731 --> 02:06:56,631
It will become more interesting from now on, right?

2576
02:06:57,101 --> 02:06:59,942
It was unbelievable yesterday.

2577
02:07:00,141 --> 02:07:01,141
- Yesterday? - Yes.

2578
02:07:01,141 --> 02:07:02,141
Did you have fun?

2579
02:07:03,112 --> 02:07:05,311
- I struggled a lot yesterday. - Why?

2580
02:07:07,042 --> 02:07:08,442
You know everything now.

2581
02:07:09,011 --> 02:07:10,752
- I know everything now. - That's right.

2582
02:07:10,851 --> 02:07:13,181
I was really happy yesterday.

2583
02:07:14,122 --> 02:07:16,992
After the message time,

2584
02:07:17,652 --> 02:07:19,521
I struggled a lot.

2585
02:07:19,622 --> 02:07:21,760
- Really? - But such a thing can happen.

2586
02:07:21,761 --> 02:07:22,890
- That's right. - That's right.

2587
02:07:22,891 --> 02:07:24,461
We have a lot of time left.

2588
02:07:24,462 --> 02:07:25,462
That's right.

2589
02:07:25,463 --> 02:07:28,202
(The two of them go someplace else.)

2590
02:07:28,902 --> 02:07:30,402
Something happened, right?

2591
02:07:30,872 --> 02:07:32,901
Was it the environment or...

2592
02:07:32,902 --> 02:07:35,640
No, it wasn't like that. Seriously,

2593
02:07:35,641 --> 02:07:37,911
I was on a date with someone I liked the most.

2594
02:07:37,912 --> 02:07:38,912
That's right.

2595
02:07:38,913 --> 02:07:40,741
I loved it. I was so happy...

2596
02:07:40,742 --> 02:07:42,510
that I made a lot of effort.

2597
02:07:42,511 --> 02:07:45,782
I did it for someone I liked the most.

2598
02:07:45,881 --> 02:07:47,781
- I could feel it. - Really?

2599
02:07:47,782 --> 02:07:49,420
I was so happy.

2600
02:07:49,421 --> 02:07:51,851
There were many incidents.

2601
02:07:52,421 --> 02:07:55,322
I think there is someone Cho A likes.

2602
02:07:55,992 --> 02:07:57,691
I don't know.

2603
02:07:57,692 --> 02:08:00,430
I don't know. If we disregard that person,

2604
02:08:00,431 --> 02:08:02,002
I might be her second favourite.

2605
02:08:02,202 --> 02:08:04,001
She might think,

2606
02:08:04,002 --> 02:08:05,372
"Jung Sub is cute and nice."

2607
02:08:05,471 --> 02:08:08,470
We are only on our 8th or 9th day.

2608
02:08:08,471 --> 02:08:10,310
- It's our eighth day. - So much time remains.

2609
02:08:10,311 --> 02:08:11,641
That's right. So much time remains.

2610
02:08:12,112 --> 02:08:14,141
I didn't think about giving up.

2611
02:08:14,841 --> 02:08:16,411
I feel like my sister...

2612
02:08:16,412 --> 02:08:18,151
is going back and forth between two people.

2613
02:08:18,152 --> 02:08:19,451
- Really? - Yes.

2614
02:08:19,452 --> 02:08:21,621
I think she likes you a lot.

2615
02:08:21,622 --> 02:08:22,622
I see.

2616
02:08:22,623 --> 02:08:25,050
I think she is still getting a feel of things.

2617
02:08:25,051 --> 02:08:26,091
It seems that way.

2618
02:08:28,122 --> 02:08:30,131
This situation is so funny.

2619
02:08:30,462 --> 02:08:35,001
He is talking to the younger brother of the woman...

2620
02:08:35,002 --> 02:08:36,800
who turned him down.

2621
02:08:36,801 --> 02:08:38,701
It's a rare situation.

2622
02:08:38,702 --> 02:08:40,300
- You don't see it anywhere else. - Seriously.

2623
02:08:40,301 --> 02:08:41,641
Her younger brother consoled him too.

2624
02:08:41,742 --> 02:08:43,111
- I know. - He was like,

2625
02:08:43,112 --> 02:08:44,412
"It's okay."

2626
02:08:44,712 --> 02:08:46,241
(They get ready to go back to Seoul.)

2627
02:08:46,242 --> 02:08:47,341
Well done.

2628
02:08:47,442 --> 02:08:48,840
- Well done. - Yes.

2629
02:08:48,841 --> 02:08:50,081
I have so much to talk about.

2630
02:08:50,082 --> 02:08:51,810
I have so much to talk about with you.

2631
02:08:51,811 --> 02:08:54,180
Jung Sub is really nice too.

2632
02:08:54,181 --> 02:08:57,091
Really? What makes you feel that way?

2633
02:08:57,492 --> 02:08:58,622
I am curious about that.

2634
02:09:00,322 --> 02:09:02,091
He is considerate.

2635
02:09:02,192 --> 02:09:05,362
I want to see you happy.

2636
02:09:06,801 --> 02:09:09,002
I am curious about him.

2637
02:09:11,671 --> 02:09:14,901
That's why it's important to make the moves in the back.

2638
02:09:14,902 --> 02:09:16,271
Does it have a big effect?

2639
02:09:16,372 --> 02:09:17,541
Cheol Hyeon talked to her right away.

2640
02:09:17,542 --> 02:09:18,941
He got to work.

2641
02:09:18,942 --> 02:09:20,111
Seriously.

2642
02:09:20,112 --> 02:09:22,810
I am scared. Are things going to change suddenly?

2643
02:09:22,811 --> 02:09:24,651
How would it be for me? Would it have a big effect?

2644
02:09:24,652 --> 02:09:27,850
An effect? Given the siblings' relationship,

2645
02:09:27,851 --> 02:09:29,391
it might have a big effect.

2646
02:09:29,492 --> 02:09:30,520
She would look back on it.

2647
02:09:30,521 --> 02:09:32,191
If he does something,

2648
02:09:32,192 --> 02:09:33,560
she would think about it more.

2649
02:09:33,561 --> 02:09:34,921
- I see. - A bit more.

2650
02:09:35,021 --> 02:09:36,060
This happened...

2651
02:09:36,061 --> 02:09:38,191
- when the siblings got revealed. - I know.

2652
02:09:38,192 --> 02:09:40,202
- It's getting more interesting. - Seriously.

2653
02:09:40,301 --> 02:09:42,832
- Things are complicated. - This is incredible.

2654
02:09:44,231 --> 02:09:46,502
(We are home.)

2655
02:09:46,841 --> 02:09:50,141
(I love that the group is complete now.)

2656
02:09:50,511 --> 02:09:54,011
(The atmosphere of the house changed.)

2657
02:09:54,242 --> 02:09:56,651
(Jae Hyung!)

2658
02:09:56,652 --> 02:09:57,652
(Jae Hyung)

2659
02:09:57,952 --> 02:09:59,281
(He is calling you.)

2660
02:09:59,282 --> 02:10:00,420
(Why did you call me?)

2661
02:10:00,421 --> 02:10:02,151
(I just wanted to see you.)

2662
02:10:02,152 --> 02:10:05,520
(I don't know why people find my brother so cute.)

2663
02:10:05,521 --> 02:10:07,060
(It's annoying.)

2664
02:10:07,061 --> 02:10:08,161
(I have always been like that.)

2665
02:10:08,162 --> 02:10:09,731
(My brother makes me want to puke.)

2666
02:10:10,591 --> 02:10:12,831
(Hey, open your eyes wide!)

2667
02:10:12,832 --> 02:10:15,362
(I opened them as wide as I could.)

2668
02:10:15,462 --> 02:10:18,071
(My older sister is a good person.)

2669
02:10:18,072 --> 02:10:20,241
(Please be good to her.)

2670
02:10:20,242 --> 02:10:22,241
(A good person)

2671
02:10:22,242 --> 02:10:23,971
(What's wrong with her?)

2672
02:10:24,072 --> 02:10:25,770
(It's fun to watch.)

2673
02:10:25,771 --> 02:10:26,782
(Crunching)

2674
02:10:27,782 --> 02:10:29,811
(A date has been scheduled.)

2675
02:10:29,912 --> 02:10:32,621
(But only one of the siblings can go on a date.)

2676
02:10:32,622 --> 02:10:33,880
(What should I do?)

2677
02:10:33,881 --> 02:10:35,521
(You should yield.)

2678
02:10:37,622 --> 02:10:40,391
(What will be the choice of the unstoppable siblings?)
