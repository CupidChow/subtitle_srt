1
00:00:00,117 --> 00:00:01,357
(They revealed their ages.)

2
00:00:02,926 --> 00:00:04,186
(I was born in 1994.)

3
00:00:04,187 --> 00:00:05,897
(I was born in 1989.)

4
00:00:06,426 --> 00:00:08,196
(I was very surprised when I heard her age.)

5
00:00:08,327 --> 00:00:09,397
(I'm the same age as Yun Ha.)

6
00:00:10,597 --> 00:00:11,995
(Really?)

7
00:00:11,996 --> 00:00:13,736
(It's really a pity...)

8
00:00:13,737 --> 00:00:15,566
(that none of the guys are older than me.)

9
00:00:16,667 --> 00:00:18,637
(And a letter arrived.)

10
00:00:18,807 --> 00:00:21,436
(With the right to select their date for the Singapore date on the line,)

11
00:00:21,576 --> 00:00:25,116
(the Duet Contest with Siblings was held.)

12
00:00:34,017 --> 00:00:37,285
(All five pairs of siblings finished performing.)

13
00:00:37,286 --> 00:00:39,126
(Who won the Grand Prize of the 1st Duet Contest with Siblings?)

14
00:00:39,127 --> 00:00:42,166
(Grand Prize: Lee Yong Woo and Lee Ju Yeon)

15
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:43,996
(Second place: Park Jae Hyung and Park Se Seung)

16
00:00:44,566 --> 00:00:46,096
(Yong Woo and Ju Yeon won 2 flight tickets.)

17
00:00:46,097 --> 00:00:48,097
(Jae Hyung and Se Seung won 1 flight ticket.)

18
00:00:48,637 --> 00:00:50,637
(Se Seung and Jung Sub will have a date in Singapore.)

19
00:00:50,936 --> 00:00:53,436
(Ju Yeon and Jae Hyung will have a date in Singapore.)

20
00:00:54,677 --> 00:00:55,677
(To Cho A)

21
00:00:55,846 --> 00:00:58,106
(Yong Woo and Cho A will have a date in Singapore.)

22
00:00:59,346 --> 00:01:01,686
Singapore sounds fun.

23
00:01:02,546 --> 00:01:04,245
- I wonder what's waiting for us. - Exactly.

24
00:01:04,246 --> 00:01:06,216
(The 1st Duet Contest with Siblings)

25
00:01:06,656 --> 00:01:08,486
- Thank you. - Sure.

26
00:01:08,587 --> 00:01:09,727
They suit you.

27
00:01:09,856 --> 00:01:11,027
- The flowers? - Yes.

28
00:01:11,257 --> 00:01:12,896
You can't tell which is the flower, can you?

29
00:01:12,897 --> 00:01:14,257
Cho A?

30
00:01:14,427 --> 00:01:17,527
Last time, everyone gave up their chance,

31
00:01:17,927 --> 00:01:19,536
- so we couldn't go on a date. - Really?

32
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:22,007
- They're all so close. - Exactly.

33
00:01:22,466 --> 00:01:23,866
I didn't give up,

34
00:01:23,867 --> 00:01:25,105
- Really? - but she did.

35
00:01:25,106 --> 00:01:26,677
Really? You didn't give up?

36
00:01:26,936 --> 00:01:28,076
Was that what happened?

37
00:01:28,477 --> 00:01:31,575
- No, I didn't give up. - Excuse me.

38
00:01:31,576 --> 00:01:33,016
I didn't give up.

39
00:01:33,177 --> 00:01:34,277
Shall we take a picture?

40
00:01:40,087 --> 00:01:41,626
It's so nice.

41
00:01:48,027 --> 00:01:49,826
Shall we get in this car?

42
00:02:01,176 --> 00:02:04,576
Aren't things somewhat going...

43
00:02:05,276 --> 00:02:07,417
in the direction that we thought of?

44
00:02:07,817 --> 00:02:10,546
No, I didn't want to place second.

45
00:02:10,717 --> 00:02:11,757
Why?

46
00:02:12,486 --> 00:02:14,217
I don't know. Now...

47
00:02:14,486 --> 00:02:16,556
Suddenly why? I thought you talked it out nicely.

48
00:02:17,486 --> 00:02:18,727
(Thinking)

49
00:02:19,826 --> 00:02:21,766
I don't know why either.

50
00:02:23,796 --> 00:02:26,036
(Meanwhile, Cho A and Yong Woo)

51
00:02:26,037 --> 00:02:27,296
Are you sure it's buckled up?

52
00:02:27,537 --> 00:02:29,336
Wait. It's this one.

53
00:02:29,967 --> 00:02:31,506
Hey, come here.

54
00:02:31,507 --> 00:02:32,606
Do we get in that one?

55
00:02:32,937 --> 00:02:33,977
Go.

56
00:02:37,676 --> 00:02:39,817
One seat... You get in this car.

57
00:02:40,046 --> 00:02:41,477
- What? - Get in that car.

58
00:02:41,616 --> 00:02:42,616
Why?

59
00:02:43,486 --> 00:02:44,646
You'll know why when you go there.

60
00:02:44,787 --> 00:02:46,217
- Bye. - No, I can't get in this car.

61
00:02:46,387 --> 00:02:48,387
I can't get in.

62
00:02:48,556 --> 00:02:49,926
Are Yong Woo and Cho A in there?

63
00:02:50,257 --> 00:02:51,355
- Why can't they get in? - Yong Woo and Cho A.

64
00:02:51,356 --> 00:02:53,497
Because it's just two of them in there.

65
00:02:53,556 --> 00:02:54,626
It looks like...

66
00:02:54,627 --> 00:02:56,325
- they can't read the room. - Read the room.

67
00:02:56,326 --> 00:02:58,735
They became an official couple that the participants acknowledge.

68
00:02:58,736 --> 00:02:59,866
That's right.

69
00:03:00,296 --> 00:03:02,467
- They became too solid. - I agree.

70
00:03:02,806 --> 00:03:05,407
(She runs away to another car.)

71
00:03:05,606 --> 00:03:07,835
- Hello. - I chose a comfortable car.

72
00:03:07,836 --> 00:03:09,676
- Hi. - Good job.

73
00:03:10,576 --> 00:03:12,175
Three here, four here.

74
00:03:12,176 --> 00:03:13,377
(Yun Jae is lost.)

75
00:03:14,046 --> 00:03:15,417
I went over there,

76
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:17,485
but Yong Woo and Cho A were there.

77
00:03:17,486 --> 00:03:19,287
I told Yun Jae, "Get in that car."

78
00:03:20,356 --> 00:03:22,227
- I ran away. - Good job.

79
00:03:22,426 --> 00:03:25,657
One more person can sit behind.

80
00:03:25,826 --> 00:03:26,997
One more person can get in.

81
00:03:27,556 --> 00:03:29,166
I should've told Yun Jae to come then.

82
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,825
- Exactly. - Three people...

83
00:03:30,826 --> 00:03:32,796
- Then... - I'll go...

84
00:03:32,937 --> 00:03:35,436
- and find my baby. - "My baby."

85
00:03:35,437 --> 00:03:37,206
- "My baby." - She called him a baby.

86
00:03:38,437 --> 00:03:39,507
Do you want to get in this car?

87
00:03:39,776 --> 00:03:40,835
Which one?

88
00:03:40,836 --> 00:03:42,706
- This... - Cheol Hyeon, you can get in there.

89
00:03:42,776 --> 00:03:43,906
- What about me? - Is there a seat left?

90
00:03:43,907 --> 00:03:44,977
Yes, there is.

91
00:03:47,917 --> 00:03:50,116
- I rescued the baby. - The car... Here too.

92
00:03:50,616 --> 00:03:53,256
- Sit at the back. - No, I'll move to the back.

93
00:03:53,257 --> 00:03:54,257
(He empties the seat beside Yun Ha and moves to the back.)

94
00:03:54,258 --> 00:03:55,956
- There's no middle seat. - There's no middle seat here.

95
00:03:56,227 --> 00:03:57,627
He likes to be in the center.

96
00:03:58,627 --> 00:03:59,855
- Really? - Me?

97
00:03:59,856 --> 00:04:01,826
- I don't. - I should sit here.

98
00:04:04,097 --> 00:04:05,336
Excuse me.

99
00:04:10,206 --> 00:04:11,836
Did we arrive first?

100
00:04:13,536 --> 00:04:15,075
(Cho A, Yong Woo, and Ju Yeon arrive.)

101
00:04:15,076 --> 00:04:16,076
It's warm.

102
00:04:20,276 --> 00:04:22,286
I'm telling you, you worked hard.

103
00:04:22,617 --> 00:04:24,747
We proudly placed first.

104
00:04:25,156 --> 00:04:27,057
- Let's proudly go to Singapore. - Yes.

105
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:30,257
(Jae Hyung, Se Seung, and Cheol Hyeon arrive.)

106
00:04:31,127 --> 00:04:32,696
- Home sweet home. - When did you get back?

107
00:04:32,697 --> 00:04:34,155
- Just now. Welcome back. - Hey, winner.

108
00:04:34,156 --> 00:04:35,196
Welcome back.

109
00:04:35,197 --> 00:04:38,026
("Hype Boy" still lingers in their minds.)

110
00:04:38,836 --> 00:04:40,266
Like boy

111
00:04:40,297 --> 00:04:43,165
(Because I)

112
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:44,265
(Like boy)

113
00:04:44,266 --> 00:04:46,035
(Chemical hype boy)

114
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,276
(Like boy)

115
00:04:47,637 --> 00:04:49,006
(To the house full of joy)

116
00:04:49,007 --> 00:04:50,007
- You're back. - Hello.

117
00:04:50,008 --> 00:04:51,345
You're back.

118
00:04:51,346 --> 00:04:52,376
You're back.

119
00:04:52,377 --> 00:04:53,747
(Jung Sub, Yun Ha, Ji Won, and Yun Jae arrive.)

120
00:04:53,947 --> 00:04:55,015
Hello.

121
00:04:55,016 --> 00:04:56,117
Gosh, "Hype Boy."

122
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,516
"Hype Boy."

123
00:04:57,987 --> 00:05:00,316
- He's really a hype boy. - He's really a hype boy.

124
00:05:00,317 --> 00:05:03,026
- Yun Ha, can you take this? - Okay.

125
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:06,656
(Tell me, yes, feel it)

126
00:05:07,697 --> 00:05:11,197
(Meanwhile, Cho A is staring into her phone.)

127
00:05:12,497 --> 00:05:13,666
Is Cho A back?

128
00:05:17,336 --> 00:05:18,536
What are you doing?

129
00:05:19,036 --> 00:05:20,936
I'm just enjoying this feeling.

130
00:05:20,937 --> 00:05:22,506
Are you? I see.

131
00:05:22,507 --> 00:05:24,507
- I'll support you two. - Show me the pictures.

132
00:05:24,807 --> 00:05:25,817
Cheol Hyeon.

133
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:27,946
Did you record Cho A's and my performance?

134
00:05:27,947 --> 00:05:29,546
Cho A, let's watch this together.

135
00:05:29,547 --> 00:05:30,617
What is it?

136
00:05:31,447 --> 00:05:33,257
I really want to delete this, but...

137
00:05:34,786 --> 00:05:35,887
I don't want to watch it.

138
00:05:36,786 --> 00:05:37,956
Why? Let's watch...

139
00:05:38,387 --> 00:05:39,757
and delete it tomorrow.

140
00:05:40,026 --> 00:05:42,095
Let me see the pictures you took just now.

141
00:05:42,096 --> 00:05:43,265
- Which ones? - You took some.

142
00:05:43,266 --> 00:05:45,266
The pictures? They're taken very well.

143
00:05:48,396 --> 00:05:50,836
- It's so... - You look really good together.

144
00:05:51,507 --> 00:05:55,307
I decided to support you two all the way from today.

145
00:05:56,607 --> 00:06:00,547
(She looks at the picture for a long time.)

146
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:03,785
Shall we go down and watch this together?

147
00:06:03,786 --> 00:06:05,415
We look a bit alike.

148
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:07,057
Yes, you guys look great together.

149
00:06:07,257 --> 00:06:08,955
- You took the pictures well. - Let's go down and watch this.

150
00:06:08,956 --> 00:06:10,656
- No. - Let's watch together.

151
00:06:13,896 --> 00:06:15,196
- What is it? - I want to watch the video...

152
00:06:15,197 --> 00:06:16,465
that was taken just now.

153
00:06:16,466 --> 00:06:18,526
Really? Is there a video?

154
00:06:18,896 --> 00:06:19,936
Yong Woo,

155
00:06:19,937 --> 00:06:21,366
- aren't you way too charming? - That's right.

156
00:06:21,367 --> 00:06:22,405
What?

157
00:06:22,406 --> 00:06:23,737
You're so cool.

158
00:06:27,036 --> 00:06:29,377
- I'm scared. - Why?

159
00:06:29,747 --> 00:06:30,776
This...

160
00:06:31,007 --> 00:06:32,876
When I'm interested in someone,

161
00:06:32,877 --> 00:06:36,316
I keep looking and observing the person.

162
00:06:36,317 --> 00:06:38,316
By the way, Ju Yeon is really cute.

163
00:06:38,317 --> 00:06:40,887
- Yes, she's so lovely. - She's... Yes.

164
00:06:41,216 --> 00:06:43,455
We keep making eye contact.

165
00:06:43,456 --> 00:06:46,557
Isn't she like a typical youngest daughter?

166
00:06:55,966 --> 00:06:57,107
She fell asleep.

167
00:06:58,507 --> 00:06:59,776
Is this a showroom?

168
00:07:00,406 --> 00:07:01,775
- Ji Won. - Yes?

169
00:07:01,776 --> 00:07:03,645
- Whose is this? - Aren't you being too comfortable?

170
00:07:03,646 --> 00:07:04,807
Whose is this?

171
00:07:04,976 --> 00:07:07,546
It's like a clothes shop.

172
00:07:07,547 --> 00:07:08,716
Can I try them on?

173
00:07:09,586 --> 00:07:11,146
Are you wearing makeup on your face?

174
00:07:12,286 --> 00:07:14,216
You can't wait to try it on.

175
00:07:16,156 --> 00:07:19,396
You're wearing it like a rabbit.

176
00:07:19,956 --> 00:07:21,896
It might be the right size for you.

177
00:07:24,266 --> 00:07:25,697
It fits you perfectly.

178
00:07:25,797 --> 00:07:26,867
Put this in.

179
00:07:26,997 --> 00:07:29,906
- You look so small and cute. - What's this?

180
00:07:30,637 --> 00:07:31,706
What's this?

181
00:07:32,877 --> 00:07:34,177
- What's this? - "What's this?"

182
00:07:34,607 --> 00:07:36,406
- It looks heavy. - It's just being cute.

183
00:07:37,447 --> 00:07:38,817
You act cute too.

184
00:07:40,076 --> 00:07:42,316
The clothes are being cute, not me.

185
00:07:42,317 --> 00:07:44,786
Jae Hyung is older than Ji Won.

186
00:07:45,187 --> 00:07:46,757
- Older? - No.

187
00:07:47,086 --> 00:07:48,215
Younger.

188
00:07:48,216 --> 00:07:49,226
- Older brother. - Jae Hyung.

189
00:07:52,857 --> 00:07:55,796
Everyone, I have an announcement.

190
00:07:55,797 --> 00:07:57,596
- What is it? - Sit down and talk.

191
00:07:59,036 --> 00:08:00,396
Tomorrow,

192
00:08:00,997 --> 00:08:02,466
- I'm having a recital. - Amazing.

193
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:05,536
It's at 7:30pm. If you can make it, please come.

194
00:08:05,807 --> 00:08:07,177
- I'll definitely go. - No.

195
00:08:07,437 --> 00:08:09,405
- I can make it tomorrow too. - Really?

196
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:10,576
I can make it too.

197
00:08:10,976 --> 00:08:13,076
- Then everyone can make it. - Everyone can make it.

198
00:08:13,146 --> 00:08:14,946
(They decide to go to Yun Ha's recital tomorrow evening.)

199
00:08:14,947 --> 00:08:16,117
Finally.

200
00:08:22,056 --> 00:08:25,185
(On the 12th day, it's the final message in Seoul.)

201
00:08:25,186 --> 00:08:29,497
(Who made your heart flutter?)

202
00:08:30,196 --> 00:08:31,467
"The final in Seoul?"

203
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:36,406
"The final message in Seoul."

204
00:08:40,577 --> 00:08:43,607
(It's the final choice in Seoul...)

205
00:08:43,747 --> 00:08:46,347
(and the ninth choice.)

206
00:08:56,926 --> 00:09:00,327
(Yun Jae's phone rings fast.)

207
00:09:00,396 --> 00:09:01,925
(On the 12th day, it's the finally message in Seoul.)

208
00:09:01,926 --> 00:09:04,895
(Who made your heart flutter? Send the name and the message.)

209
00:09:04,896 --> 00:09:06,395
(Lee Yun Ha)

210
00:09:06,396 --> 00:09:07,867
(Write the content of the message.)

211
00:09:12,676 --> 00:09:14,706
(He rubs his eyes and reads again.)

212
00:09:14,707 --> 00:09:17,406
(He tries again without hesitation.)

213
00:09:27,516 --> 00:09:29,285
(My feelings have not changed since the beginning.)

214
00:09:29,286 --> 00:09:32,327
(You need to send the message that will be forwarded to Yun Ha.)

215
00:09:34,026 --> 00:09:35,326
(Humming)

216
00:09:35,327 --> 00:09:36,627
I don't understand.

217
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:43,637
- He needs to write the content, - Her name...

218
00:09:43,967 --> 00:09:46,976
but he wrote her name "Lee Yun Ha."

219
00:09:46,977 --> 00:09:48,077
Oh, my goodness.

220
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:50,476
Has he been doing it wrong all this time?

221
00:09:50,477 --> 00:09:52,176
It seems like that.

222
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:55,046
(He tries again.)

223
00:09:55,847 --> 00:09:58,117
- Should I learn Korean again? - Why?

224
00:09:58,446 --> 00:10:00,117
I can't understand the instruction at once.

225
00:10:00,487 --> 00:10:01,916
Which part is confusing?

226
00:10:04,727 --> 00:10:05,997
I think I don't read it carefully.

227
00:10:06,926 --> 00:10:09,367
(He was nervous when making the first choice.)

228
00:10:09,497 --> 00:10:10,765
(Don't you need to send one?)

229
00:10:10,766 --> 00:10:12,796
(He already sent it.)

230
00:10:14,367 --> 00:10:15,606
(The siblings have been revealed. Who made your heart flutter?)

231
00:10:15,607 --> 00:10:17,065
(Lee Yun Ha)

232
00:10:17,066 --> 00:10:18,536
(Write the content of the message.)

233
00:10:20,877 --> 00:10:23,247
(I just had a good feeling since yesterday.)

234
00:10:23,607 --> 00:10:26,146
That's why the message was sent that way.

235
00:10:27,016 --> 00:10:28,217
The way he wrote.

236
00:10:29,117 --> 00:10:30,987
(I don't know what's happening.)

237
00:10:32,156 --> 00:10:33,915
(Who made your heart flutter? If there is nobody, text "None.")

238
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,685
(Lee Yun Ha)

239
00:10:35,686 --> 00:10:39,426
(Write the content of the message.)

240
00:10:43,066 --> 00:10:45,997
(She is charming.)

241
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:50,736
(He is confused about the message system,)

242
00:10:50,737 --> 00:10:52,977
(but he texts "Lee Yun Ha.")

243
00:10:56,577 --> 00:11:00,446
(I'll enjoy tomorrow's recital.)

244
00:11:00,847 --> 00:11:03,087
(Did you think you would end up liking someone in here?)

245
00:11:03,316 --> 00:11:05,986
No, I never thought this would happen...

246
00:11:05,987 --> 00:11:07,257
in the beginning.

247
00:11:10,327 --> 00:11:13,857
(The egg fried rice was delicious.)

248
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:23,306
Him being a really good cook makes him look cool...

249
00:11:23,367 --> 00:11:25,467
and I really enjoyed the food.

250
00:11:25,607 --> 00:11:27,806
That's why I sent that message.

251
00:11:28,337 --> 00:11:30,376
(They chose each other for 3 days.)

252
00:11:30,377 --> 00:11:32,076
To who?

253
00:11:32,077 --> 00:11:33,446
- Are you doing it for him? - If you do that...

254
00:11:33,516 --> 00:11:37,217
(Lee Yun Ha chose your sibling.)

255
00:11:37,747 --> 00:11:39,887
That's so not it. I don't know.

256
00:11:40,156 --> 00:11:42,526
Since my relationship became stable,

257
00:11:42,656 --> 00:11:45,726
I should help that dark friend...

258
00:11:45,727 --> 00:11:47,656
to make hers stable.

259
00:11:51,426 --> 00:11:56,166
(Good luck with your recital tomorrow!)

260
00:11:56,306 --> 00:11:58,406
Yun Jae sent a message to my sister,

261
00:11:58,806 --> 00:12:00,137
but one more person sent it to her.

262
00:12:00,577 --> 00:12:01,577
What's happening?

263
00:12:01,906 --> 00:12:02,977
Jae Hyung?

264
00:12:03,507 --> 00:12:04,546
I think it was him.

265
00:12:05,077 --> 00:12:08,176
(The person that texted Yun Ha)

266
00:12:09,717 --> 00:12:12,045
(Yun Jae and Cheol Hyeon chose your sibling.)

267
00:12:12,046 --> 00:12:13,757
Cheol Hyeon suddenly texted her.

268
00:12:13,957 --> 00:12:16,926
What's happening? I thought...

269
00:12:17,087 --> 00:12:19,356
he would text Ji Won.

270
00:12:19,357 --> 00:12:20,727
Cheol Hyeon, what are you thinking?

271
00:12:22,327 --> 00:12:25,226
Not too long after we came here,

272
00:12:25,227 --> 00:12:27,496
we asked her to invite us to one of her recitals.

273
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:30,207
I thought that the day finally came.

274
00:12:35,007 --> 00:12:40,577
(I was sad that we didn't get to go on a date, so this is great.)

275
00:12:42,217 --> 00:12:46,116
We didn't get to go on a date before this,

276
00:12:46,117 --> 00:12:47,387
and I was sad about it.

277
00:12:47,717 --> 00:12:51,156
Maybe we can spend more fun time together.

278
00:12:51,487 --> 00:12:55,155
I was happy. I let him know that I was upset last time,

279
00:12:55,156 --> 00:12:58,526
and it seemed that he didn't forget that.

280
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:06,077
(Being cool, fluttering, and moving. What's next?)

281
00:13:07,007 --> 00:13:09,046
I read the message happily.

282
00:13:09,577 --> 00:13:10,876
It made me smile.

283
00:13:10,877 --> 00:13:14,675
I remember sending her a message,

284
00:13:14,676 --> 00:13:16,686
"Tied hair, untied hair, what's next?"

285
00:13:17,286 --> 00:13:19,617
(Being cool, fluttering, and moving. What's next?)

286
00:13:19,786 --> 00:13:22,726
(She replied with a similar expression.)

287
00:13:22,727 --> 00:13:26,195
I did guess a bit that she was a person...

288
00:13:26,196 --> 00:13:28,497
with this kind of wittiness.

289
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:32,367
The message made me feel...

290
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:34,497
very happy.

291
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:36,566
I expressed it with three words,

292
00:13:36,837 --> 00:13:39,775
but it also meant that I was looking forward...

293
00:13:39,776 --> 00:13:43,406
to us in the future.

294
00:13:43,676 --> 00:13:45,717
Actually, rather than the message,

295
00:13:48,046 --> 00:13:50,986
I think passing her the flower...

296
00:13:50,987 --> 00:13:53,816
in front of others openly...

297
00:13:54,617 --> 00:13:56,486
made us both think...

298
00:13:56,487 --> 00:13:58,757
about the same thing.

299
00:13:59,127 --> 00:14:00,196
That's what I think.

300
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,026
I remember that a bit more.

301
00:14:05,497 --> 00:14:08,597
(They delivered their thoughts to each other yet again today.)

302
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:14,806
(Let's not leave any regrets!)

303
00:14:18,007 --> 00:14:20,316
It's a bit iffy,

304
00:14:20,577 --> 00:14:22,617
but "not leave any regrets?"

305
00:14:22,747 --> 00:14:25,546
Maybe it means to commit to each other sincerely?

306
00:14:27,257 --> 00:14:29,227
That was for myself, actually.

307
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:32,086
(The day before yesterday when she sent "None,")

308
00:14:32,087 --> 00:14:35,356
(yesterday when they had a talk in the hideout,)

309
00:14:35,357 --> 00:14:38,096
(and today when she passed him the ticket,)

310
00:14:38,097 --> 00:14:42,406
(Se Seung was confused throughout.)

311
00:14:43,867 --> 00:14:46,976
If I get too immersed...

312
00:14:46,977 --> 00:14:48,606
in these confusing feelings,

313
00:14:48,607 --> 00:14:50,906
I might regret it later.

314
00:14:51,107 --> 00:14:53,747
I thought that as I was thinking about who to text.

315
00:14:53,776 --> 00:14:55,276
That was why I sent that message.

316
00:14:55,646 --> 00:14:57,086
"Let's not leave any regrets."

317
00:14:57,087 --> 00:14:58,217
(She was comforting her own confusing feelings.)

318
00:15:02,286 --> 00:15:06,426
(I'm looking forward to Singapore!)

319
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:13,265
(I prepared hard because I was sad that we couldn't go...)

320
00:15:13,266 --> 00:15:16,207
(on the Ring-ring Date. I did a great job, right?)

321
00:15:18,406 --> 00:15:20,805
I actually prepared hard...

322
00:15:20,806 --> 00:15:22,946
because I wanted to go on a date with Jae Hyung.

323
00:15:23,676 --> 00:15:25,646
That was why I put so much effort into the preparation.

324
00:15:25,877 --> 00:15:29,316
I sent him the message looking forward to a compliment.

325
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:34,957
(It's a pity.)

326
00:15:35,056 --> 00:15:37,656
(He receives another message.)

327
00:15:38,587 --> 00:15:40,896
I didn't know who sent the message.

328
00:15:41,827 --> 00:15:43,826
But I was very puzzled. "Why?"

329
00:15:43,827 --> 00:15:45,367
"What's a pity?"

330
00:15:47,296 --> 00:15:51,436
(Ju Yeon and Ji Won chose your sibling.)

331
00:15:51,607 --> 00:15:53,877
Ji Won mustered up her courage.

332
00:15:54,806 --> 00:15:56,247
I knew she would.

333
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,477
I thought about it a lot,

334
00:15:58,977 --> 00:16:00,476
but I sent it to Jae Hyung.

335
00:16:00,477 --> 00:16:02,515
In Seoul,

336
00:16:02,516 --> 00:16:06,087
we didn't have a chance to talk or go on a date.

337
00:16:06,316 --> 00:16:07,316
It was a pity.

338
00:16:07,317 --> 00:16:08,387
(She sent him a message conveying her sadness.)

339
00:16:08,887 --> 00:16:11,757
It was nice watching his performance.

340
00:16:15,967 --> 00:16:19,367
"The final message in Seoul."

341
00:16:23,707 --> 00:16:28,176
(The message conveyed her regrets towards Jae Hyung.)

342
00:16:29,946 --> 00:16:31,546
Gosh, Ji Won.

343
00:16:31,747 --> 00:16:36,016
Ji Won said she wanted to go on a date with Jae Hyung.

344
00:16:36,186 --> 00:16:38,515
Before you knew, he became a powerful man.

345
00:16:38,516 --> 00:16:40,315
Until recently, he got zero votes.

346
00:16:40,316 --> 00:16:42,357
We didn't know when he injured his fingers.

347
00:16:42,887 --> 00:16:44,987
- Come on. - I knew.

348
00:16:45,926 --> 00:16:48,896
(Where did Jae Hyung's feelings head to?)

349
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:51,795
I was very confused about that.

350
00:16:51,796 --> 00:16:54,266
So I was focusing on the notification sounds...

351
00:16:54,267 --> 00:16:55,736
more than any other time.

352
00:17:03,107 --> 00:17:05,077
Did he avoid choosing someone?

353
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:09,986
And Ji Won's phone rang.

354
00:17:10,186 --> 00:17:11,485
(Surprised)

355
00:17:11,486 --> 00:17:12,656
I thought, "Really?"

356
00:17:13,486 --> 00:17:14,486
I was a bit...

357
00:17:14,487 --> 00:17:16,686
But it couldn't have been easy for my brother.

358
00:17:18,587 --> 00:17:21,097
I really like Ju Yeon, so I don't want her to get hurt.

359
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:28,736
(Whom did Jae Hyung pick today?)

360
00:17:33,976 --> 00:17:37,506
(You have such a nice voice. The wool jacket was so cute too.)

361
00:17:37,746 --> 00:17:40,316
I had no idea. I couldn't guess who sent it to me.

362
00:17:40,317 --> 00:17:41,317
Here's why.

363
00:17:41,617 --> 00:17:45,846
Did he mean the wool jacket I wore this morning?

364
00:17:45,847 --> 00:17:48,556
Or did he mean the wool jacket we looked at when we goofed around?

365
00:17:48,557 --> 00:17:50,255
He said, "How much is this?"

366
00:17:50,256 --> 00:17:52,827
"Did you just open a high-end store?"

367
00:17:53,557 --> 00:17:56,496
The text face I added at the end is like my signature face.

368
00:17:56,726 --> 00:17:58,297
I wrote that the wool jacket was cute.

369
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,166
Actually,

370
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:02,137
I was expressing my interest with that.

371
00:18:02,867 --> 00:18:05,037
To be honest, before tonight,

372
00:18:05,837 --> 00:18:08,936
I didn't have any interest in her.

373
00:18:09,107 --> 00:18:11,706
But when I listened to her sing,

374
00:18:12,377 --> 00:18:14,617
she looked attractive then.

375
00:18:16,246 --> 00:18:18,616
For me, there has to be a factor...

376
00:18:18,617 --> 00:18:20,887
or a moment that attracts me to that person.

377
00:18:29,097 --> 00:18:30,626
Her singing drew me in.

378
00:18:30,627 --> 00:18:32,527
She looked really cool.

379
00:18:33,367 --> 00:18:35,466
To tell you the truth, during her performance,

380
00:18:35,896 --> 00:18:37,966
I felt attracted to her.

381
00:18:39,137 --> 00:18:41,307
The message said, "It's a pity."

382
00:18:42,377 --> 00:18:45,047
I got a feeling that it was Ji Won.

383
00:18:45,446 --> 00:18:48,317
When I realized that, I suddenly got really interested in her.

384
00:18:48,946 --> 00:18:51,586
The moment I got the message, I felt so attracted to her.

385
00:18:51,587 --> 00:18:53,057
But I'm not sure...

386
00:18:54,256 --> 00:18:56,155
if I felt that attraction because I got a message from her.

387
00:18:56,156 --> 00:18:57,857
Or was it because that moment...

388
00:18:58,557 --> 00:19:00,556
made me become aware of my attraction...

389
00:19:00,557 --> 00:19:02,425
when I had been somewhat interested in her all along?

390
00:19:02,426 --> 00:19:03,696
I'm not sure about that.

391
00:19:05,226 --> 00:19:06,597
So...

392
00:19:06,867 --> 00:19:07,936
that made my heart flutter a bit.

393
00:19:14,307 --> 00:19:17,377
(Jae Hyung received a ticket from Ju Yeon who won 1st place.)

394
00:19:20,377 --> 00:19:23,017
(He let Se Seung pick her date as they were in 2nd place.)

395
00:19:23,946 --> 00:19:27,416
(Ju Yeon's decision took away the burden of making a decision.)

396
00:19:28,686 --> 00:19:31,426
(If you could give the plane ticket to someone, who would it have been?)

397
00:19:31,686 --> 00:19:35,426
I would have given it to Ji Won.

398
00:19:37,327 --> 00:19:39,096
(Ji Won and Jae Hyung were on the same page...)

399
00:19:39,097 --> 00:19:41,936
(with their last decision in Seoul.)

400
00:19:45,067 --> 00:19:46,906
- How did they click like that? - Gosh.

401
00:19:47,206 --> 00:19:50,076
The contest was successful in another way.

402
00:19:50,077 --> 00:19:51,205
- Totally. - Right?

403
00:19:51,206 --> 00:19:53,745
I'm sure the staff planned this for the entertainment factor.

404
00:19:53,746 --> 00:19:54,846
Right. Who knew?

405
00:19:54,847 --> 00:19:56,516
Without this, the two of them...

406
00:19:56,517 --> 00:19:58,215
- Right. - I can't even imagine.

407
00:19:58,216 --> 00:20:00,255
When they planned this, they just wanted a group gathering.

408
00:20:00,256 --> 00:20:01,586
- That must've been the intention. - Exactly.

409
00:20:01,587 --> 00:20:03,655
- Yes. Each moment is so important. - Right.

410
00:20:03,656 --> 00:20:06,097
Love can start anywhere. You never know.

411
00:20:06,696 --> 00:20:08,895
I've never seen this before. This is fascinating.

412
00:20:08,896 --> 00:20:10,566
I didn't know they could fall for each other...

413
00:20:10,567 --> 00:20:12,425
- Right. - literally in a moment.

414
00:20:12,426 --> 00:20:13,536
- What is this? - This is so fascinating.

415
00:20:13,537 --> 00:20:14,636
Here's a thing about Jae Hyung.

416
00:20:14,637 --> 00:20:17,205
Having that one moment that draws him into a woman...

417
00:20:17,206 --> 00:20:18,806
- is very important to him. - He needs that.

418
00:20:18,807 --> 00:20:21,107
- Right. He definitely needs it. - That's my opinion.

419
00:20:21,337 --> 00:20:23,076
Jae Hyung is a careful person.

420
00:20:23,077 --> 00:20:24,876
But he made an advance to Ji Won. This means he was quite attracted...

421
00:20:24,877 --> 00:20:25,877
- to her. - Right.

422
00:20:28,017 --> 00:20:30,215
(Cho A chose your sibling.)

423
00:20:30,216 --> 00:20:33,787
(Ju Yeon didn't get any message.)

424
00:20:39,996 --> 00:20:41,597
I had a hard time controlling my facial expression.

425
00:20:42,256 --> 00:20:45,826
I didn't think I wouldn't get a message today.

426
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,067
So I felt...

427
00:20:48,037 --> 00:20:49,506
quite dejected.

428
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,236
Jae Hyung...

429
00:20:52,906 --> 00:20:54,837
Then whom did he send his message today?

430
00:20:55,607 --> 00:20:59,517
I don't think I was attracted to Ju Yeon romantically.

431
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:01,216
She's just...

432
00:21:04,617 --> 00:21:07,186
She's kind, sweet, and gentle.

433
00:21:07,887 --> 00:21:09,985
I was grateful for that and could feel that...

434
00:21:09,986 --> 00:21:12,087
she was a nice person. That was the extent of my feelings.

435
00:21:13,297 --> 00:21:16,567
I had a hard time figuring out assessing my feelings.

436
00:21:25,837 --> 00:21:28,376
In a way, I danced to court him.

437
00:21:28,377 --> 00:21:30,006
But he rejected me.

438
00:21:30,547 --> 00:21:31,847
So that hit me harder.

439
00:21:32,547 --> 00:21:35,646
"Why did I try so hard? Why did I dance?"

440
00:21:37,716 --> 00:21:40,916
I did it, hoping other people would have fun watching us perform.

441
00:21:41,117 --> 00:21:44,127
But other people didn't send me a message.

442
00:21:44,527 --> 00:21:46,857
So I'm like, "For what?"

443
00:21:48,656 --> 00:21:50,367
"Why did I prepare this performance? For what?"

444
00:21:52,896 --> 00:21:55,196
(No one chose your sibling.)

445
00:21:59,236 --> 00:22:01,277
I thought, "Ju Yeon must be hurt."

446
00:22:02,107 --> 00:22:04,776
Then I thought she would ask to talk to me later.

447
00:22:04,777 --> 00:22:06,577
That's what I thought.

448
00:22:06,946 --> 00:22:10,017
(All messages have been sent.)

449
00:22:12,246 --> 00:22:15,087
(Their last messages in Seoul were sent out.)

450
00:22:16,926 --> 00:22:19,656
(Ji Won is looking at the text message.)

451
00:22:26,027 --> 00:22:27,537
Aren't you curious why I smiled?

452
00:22:28,037 --> 00:22:29,567
- No. - It's not what you think.

453
00:22:30,466 --> 00:22:32,336
- Is that so? - It's not what you think.

454
00:22:32,337 --> 00:22:33,936
Okay. I got it.

455
00:22:34,406 --> 00:22:35,576
You mustered up your courage.

456
00:22:35,577 --> 00:22:36,975
- What? - You mustered up your courage.

457
00:22:36,976 --> 00:22:38,107
How did you know?

458
00:22:41,847 --> 00:22:42,847
I...

459
00:22:43,746 --> 00:22:45,787
got a message. But I don't know who sent it to me.

460
00:22:46,787 --> 00:22:47,817
Cheol Hyeon?

461
00:22:49,416 --> 00:22:51,827
But the content of the message...

462
00:22:54,256 --> 00:22:55,597
- Do you think it's my brother? - What?

463
00:22:56,466 --> 00:22:57,966
- No. - What did the message say?

464
00:22:58,926 --> 00:23:00,995
It said I had a nice voice...

465
00:23:00,996 --> 00:23:03,767
and the wool jacket was cute.

466
00:23:04,006 --> 00:23:05,337
The wool jacket?

467
00:23:07,436 --> 00:23:11,307
Jae Hyung tried on my wool jacket earlier.

468
00:23:11,946 --> 00:23:13,117
Is that so?

469
00:23:13,617 --> 00:23:15,277
But I think Jae Hyung...

470
00:23:17,186 --> 00:23:18,287
might have chosen Ju Yeon.

471
00:23:18,716 --> 00:23:19,857
I really have no idea.

472
00:23:24,787 --> 00:23:26,226
Will you ask your brother?

473
00:23:26,726 --> 00:23:28,156
What? Ask him what?

474
00:23:28,557 --> 00:23:30,496
If you ask him, you can find out who it was.

475
00:23:30,797 --> 00:23:31,896
I should ask him.

476
00:23:33,367 --> 00:23:34,537
What are you making?

477
00:23:35,097 --> 00:23:36,637
- What? Are you hungry? - Yes.

478
00:23:37,337 --> 00:23:39,107
- Will you have some? - What are you making?

479
00:23:39,567 --> 00:23:41,675
- Kimchi fried rice. - I don't want rice.

480
00:23:41,676 --> 00:23:43,107
Or I was going to make...

481
00:23:43,476 --> 00:23:44,806
- tofu with kimchi. - But what if...

482
00:23:44,807 --> 00:23:46,816
it's not tasty because kimchi isn't fermented?

483
00:23:46,817 --> 00:23:48,745
No. I have vinegar and sugar, so I can make it.

484
00:23:48,746 --> 00:23:49,846
Then let's have tofu with kimchi.

485
00:23:49,847 --> 00:23:51,016
- Tofu with kimchi? - Yes.

486
00:23:51,017 --> 00:23:52,117
It will only take five minutes.

487
00:23:53,017 --> 00:23:54,416
We're going to have tofu with kimchi.

488
00:23:54,587 --> 00:23:56,216
Is that so? Did you decide to eat?

489
00:23:57,756 --> 00:23:59,826
I'll have to think a bit more if I want to find out.

490
00:23:59,827 --> 00:24:01,656
Really? Okay.

491
00:24:04,527 --> 00:24:07,236
(Se Seung takes the initiative herself.)

492
00:24:08,837 --> 00:24:10,807
To whom did you send your message?

493
00:24:11,436 --> 00:24:12,906
- Who sent the messages to me? - Have this.

494
00:24:13,206 --> 00:24:14,806
You tell me 1st. I asked 1st.

495
00:24:14,807 --> 00:24:16,206
This is about me.

496
00:24:19,817 --> 00:24:21,246
Ju Yeon and Ji Won.

497
00:24:21,617 --> 00:24:23,287
- To whom did you send it? - Ji Won.

498
00:24:25,746 --> 00:24:28,256
But the thing is, I don't have...

499
00:24:29,387 --> 00:24:30,856
any grand intention behind that.

500
00:24:30,857 --> 00:24:32,286
I know that. But...

501
00:24:32,287 --> 00:24:34,895
If I were to send it to Ju Yeon, I would be giving her...

502
00:24:34,896 --> 00:24:36,027
- false hopes. - Okay.

503
00:24:36,696 --> 00:24:38,466
I must go to sleep after a shower.

504
00:24:38,966 --> 00:24:41,096
I must go to sleep after a quick shower.

505
00:24:41,097 --> 00:24:42,465
So I was a bit confused.

506
00:24:42,466 --> 00:24:44,006
But why did Ji Won send it to me?

507
00:24:44,936 --> 00:24:46,606
I must go to sleep after I wash up.

508
00:24:46,607 --> 00:24:48,536
- Oh, no. - I must go to sleep after a shower.

509
00:24:48,537 --> 00:24:49,636
- What is it? - Hold on!

510
00:24:49,637 --> 00:24:51,346
- No. Don't hear that! - Is she...

511
00:24:51,347 --> 00:24:52,976
I must go to sleep after a shower.

512
00:24:53,446 --> 00:24:55,176
I must go to sleep after a shower.

513
00:24:55,646 --> 00:24:57,786
I must go to sleep after a quick shower.

514
00:24:57,787 --> 00:24:59,185
So I was a bit confused.

515
00:24:59,186 --> 00:25:00,756
But why did Ji Won send it to me?

516
00:25:01,656 --> 00:25:03,425
I must go to sleep after a shower.

517
00:25:03,426 --> 00:25:05,286
- Oh, no. - I must go to sleep after a shower.

518
00:25:05,287 --> 00:25:06,326
- What is it? - Hold on!

519
00:25:06,327 --> 00:25:08,026
- No. Don't hear that! - Is she...

520
00:25:08,027 --> 00:25:09,866
I must go to sleep after a shower.

521
00:25:09,867 --> 00:25:11,567
I thought you would have sent it to Yun Ha.

522
00:25:12,666 --> 00:25:14,367
I must go to sleep after a shower.

523
00:25:14,567 --> 00:25:15,966
Let's wash up.

524
00:25:16,466 --> 00:25:18,406
- Let's wash up. - Quickly.

525
00:25:24,307 --> 00:25:25,505
"Let's wash up."

526
00:25:25,506 --> 00:25:27,216
Is there a cap on the amount of water they can use for showers?

527
00:25:28,117 --> 00:25:29,117
- Is there? - This is funny.

528
00:25:29,118 --> 00:25:31,185
I was worried that she might hear them talk.

529
00:25:31,186 --> 00:25:32,847
- It would have hurt her feelings. - Right.

530
00:25:33,817 --> 00:25:35,087
I can't cut it like this.

531
00:25:35,456 --> 00:25:36,527
I have no choice.

532
00:25:37,656 --> 00:25:39,027
- Ask him. - Yes.

533
00:25:41,327 --> 00:25:42,725
(Sighing)

534
00:25:42,726 --> 00:25:43,726
What is it?

535
00:25:45,396 --> 00:25:47,296
(As she hesitates, the hungry people swarm over.)

536
00:25:47,297 --> 00:25:49,136
- What are you drizzling? - Vinegar.

537
00:25:49,137 --> 00:25:50,767
(I see.)

538
00:25:53,577 --> 00:25:54,836
(With vinegar and sugar, it turns into aged kimchi.)

539
00:25:54,837 --> 00:25:56,577
- Gosh. - Yun Jae is amazing.

540
00:25:57,607 --> 00:26:00,176
- We're watching him cook. - We're watching.

541
00:26:01,377 --> 00:26:02,847
(Impressed)

542
00:26:03,347 --> 00:26:04,446
Coat it.

543
00:26:06,517 --> 00:26:07,517
This is amazing.

544
00:26:09,287 --> 00:26:10,387
You look so professional.

545
00:26:11,127 --> 00:26:12,255
Were you always...

546
00:26:12,256 --> 00:26:13,327
- interested in cooking? - Yes.

547
00:26:13,896 --> 00:26:15,527
I had to live alone, so I had to cook for myself.

548
00:26:21,436 --> 00:26:22,695
Don't eat a lot.

549
00:26:22,696 --> 00:26:23,966
That's why I didn't cook a lot of kimchi on purpose.

550
00:26:25,906 --> 00:26:27,736
Who sent the message to me?

551
00:26:27,976 --> 00:26:29,236
- Jae Hyung. - Jae Hyung?

552
00:26:30,307 --> 00:26:31,347
Yes, Jae Hyung.

553
00:26:32,307 --> 00:26:34,415
(He's too busy adding the tofu pieces.)

554
00:26:34,416 --> 00:26:35,416
Really?

555
00:26:36,916 --> 00:26:39,246
(Hesitant)

556
00:26:39,716 --> 00:26:41,656
The same person sent me the message, right?

557
00:26:42,456 --> 00:26:43,486
Of course.

558
00:26:44,027 --> 00:26:45,156
That won't change.

559
00:26:46,627 --> 00:26:47,955
- Jae Hyung? - What?

560
00:26:47,956 --> 00:26:48,996
Jae Hyung?

561
00:26:51,196 --> 00:26:52,797
(Sighing)

562
00:26:54,037 --> 00:26:55,097
(Screaming)

563
00:26:55,597 --> 00:26:56,636
What is it?

564
00:26:56,637 --> 00:26:59,976
You know, I wanted to go on a date with him for a while now.

565
00:27:00,506 --> 00:27:01,536
(She shares her frustration of the situations, not aligning.)

566
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:03,946
But our situations didn't work out again and again.

567
00:27:05,807 --> 00:27:07,776
I didn't give up, per se.

568
00:27:07,777 --> 00:27:10,387
But I was sort of running out of energy.

569
00:27:11,946 --> 00:27:13,017
Move.

570
00:27:16,317 --> 00:27:17,485
- She's asking for advice. - "Move."

571
00:27:17,486 --> 00:27:18,655
He's just like me.

572
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:20,597
- He's just like my brother. - Seriously. Come on.

573
00:27:21,057 --> 00:27:22,655
- "Move." - Yun Jae...

574
00:27:22,656 --> 00:27:23,995
Is he here to cook tofu with kimchi?

575
00:27:23,996 --> 00:27:25,627
- He's here to go on dates. - Exactly.

576
00:27:26,567 --> 00:27:29,665
- Help your sister. - Well, he's cooking right now.

577
00:27:29,666 --> 00:27:31,366
- He should still listen to her. - Right.

578
00:27:31,367 --> 00:27:33,276
She's sharing her frustration to her brother.

579
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:34,806
Right. Is this a cooking contest?

580
00:27:34,807 --> 00:27:36,005
- He's the only one she can rely on. - Right.

581
00:27:36,006 --> 00:27:37,445
- But he told her to move? - Exactly.

582
00:27:37,446 --> 00:27:39,106
She rarely talks about her feelings.

583
00:27:39,107 --> 00:27:40,945
Well, I'm on his side.

584
00:27:40,946 --> 00:27:42,046
Come on.

585
00:27:42,047 --> 00:27:44,646
But I was sort of running out of energy.

586
00:27:46,087 --> 00:27:47,117
Move.

587
00:27:51,557 --> 00:27:53,155
He was busy trying to make himself look good,

588
00:27:53,156 --> 00:27:54,755
so he was focused on cooking.

589
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:57,096
If I asked him to talk to him in the hideout,

590
00:27:57,097 --> 00:27:58,166
I got the feeling he would be annoyed.

591
00:27:59,067 --> 00:28:01,867
So I hovered around him when he was cooking.

592
00:28:02,436 --> 00:28:03,767
Then I asked him who sent the message to me.

593
00:28:04,067 --> 00:28:06,637
"Jae Hyung." He mouthed Jae Hyung's name.

594
00:28:07,077 --> 00:28:08,876
We didn't have any chance to interact.

595
00:28:08,877 --> 00:28:11,205
But despite that, the thought...

596
00:28:11,206 --> 00:28:13,516
that Jae Hyung must've liked something about me...

597
00:28:13,517 --> 00:28:14,877
made me feel good.

598
00:28:17,047 --> 00:28:18,915
So we'll get to see...

599
00:28:18,916 --> 00:28:21,156
your beautiful performance tomorrow, Yun Ha?

600
00:28:21,916 --> 00:28:23,155
- Yun Ha - I'm...

601
00:28:23,156 --> 00:28:24,456
I'm looking for a vase.

602
00:28:25,156 --> 00:28:26,626
We need a decently-sized vase.

603
00:28:26,627 --> 00:28:27,726
- Right? - Yes.

604
00:28:28,256 --> 00:28:29,357
I see. That?

605
00:28:29,966 --> 00:28:32,426
- I think we can put them in here. - Sounds good.

606
00:28:32,597 --> 00:28:33,695
(Impressed)

607
00:28:33,696 --> 00:28:35,296
You found a beautiful vase.

608
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:36,566
Where did you find this?

609
00:28:36,567 --> 00:28:38,337
- I spotted it when it was hiding. - Really?

610
00:28:39,006 --> 00:28:40,036
You can put them in personally.

611
00:28:40,037 --> 00:28:42,276
I'll put them in personally since they're my flowers.

612
00:28:42,277 --> 00:28:43,876
That vase is beautiful.

613
00:28:43,877 --> 00:28:44,906
- Right. - What is it?

614
00:28:45,077 --> 00:28:46,347
Let's pour a bit of water.

615
00:28:48,246 --> 00:28:49,617
This is perfect.

616
00:28:52,416 --> 00:28:54,215
Don't use your power to rip it.

617
00:28:54,216 --> 00:28:55,256
Don't?

618
00:28:55,857 --> 00:28:56,985
Okay. I got it.

619
00:28:56,986 --> 00:28:58,127
- I'll be gentle with the flowers. - It's...

620
00:28:59,926 --> 00:29:01,096
- Did you put water in it? - Yes.

621
00:29:01,097 --> 00:29:02,726
What? Why did you pour so little?

622
00:29:05,226 --> 00:29:06,965
We must give a lot of water, so they last long.

623
00:29:06,966 --> 00:29:08,067
Yes. Okay.

624
00:29:08,597 --> 00:29:10,005
I hope they last for a long time...

625
00:29:10,006 --> 00:29:11,436
- in this beautiful state. - Okay.

626
00:29:14,736 --> 00:29:16,746
Do you know how to arrange flowers?

627
00:29:17,246 --> 00:29:19,206
I'm just putting them in. They fit perfectly.

628
00:29:19,476 --> 00:29:21,877
They're beautiful. They look so elegant.

629
00:29:22,317 --> 00:29:24,416
The flowers look great in this house.

630
00:29:24,617 --> 00:29:25,645
- Right? - Yes.

631
00:29:25,646 --> 00:29:26,716
They brightened the place.

632
00:29:26,887 --> 00:29:28,915
He gave me the flowers at the restaurant.

633
00:29:28,916 --> 00:29:31,326
After getting the flowers from him,

634
00:29:31,327 --> 00:29:34,395
I could feel that I was bonding a lot more with Yong Woo.

635
00:29:34,396 --> 00:29:37,726
Now that there was an occasion we confirmed each other's feelings.

636
00:29:38,496 --> 00:29:39,797
Do you want me to take a picture of you?

637
00:29:40,797 --> 00:29:42,637
One, two, three.

638
00:29:44,767 --> 00:29:48,336
Yong Woo actively took pictures of me.

639
00:29:48,337 --> 00:29:52,446
At one point, I sensed that he was looking at me quite often.

640
00:29:52,706 --> 00:29:53,847
They look great.

641
00:29:54,976 --> 00:29:55,976
They are so beautiful.

642
00:29:57,817 --> 00:30:00,586
When I looked, he looked at me at the same time.

643
00:30:00,587 --> 00:30:01,756
So it made my heart flutter.

644
00:30:03,756 --> 00:30:07,096
It wasn't anything verbal. The energy I felt from her heart...

645
00:30:07,097 --> 00:30:08,426
gave me a huge sense of trust.

646
00:30:08,756 --> 00:30:12,165
I believe that's the biggest attractive quality of Cho A...

647
00:30:12,166 --> 00:30:13,367
in my opinion.

648
00:30:14,097 --> 00:30:15,596
- He sounds a lot more certain... - Yes.

649
00:30:15,597 --> 00:30:16,706
compared to before.

650
00:30:16,867 --> 00:30:18,566
Making a grand gesture in front of everyone...

651
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:20,675
- left a huge impact. - Yes.

652
00:30:20,676 --> 00:30:22,505
- He showed it to everyone. - Right.

653
00:30:22,506 --> 00:30:24,307
- It gave a big sense of assurance. - Yes.

654
00:30:24,446 --> 00:30:25,847
That's why actions matter.

655
00:30:28,617 --> 00:30:30,445
- Gosh, it smells amazing. - Right?

656
00:30:30,446 --> 00:30:32,316
- Let's have it downstairs. - Okay.

657
00:30:32,317 --> 00:30:33,455
- Gosh. - It's so tasty.

658
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:34,756
- Thank you. - No?

659
00:30:35,117 --> 00:30:36,856
(I'll go upstairs.)

660
00:30:36,857 --> 00:30:37,857
So sad.

661
00:30:38,426 --> 00:30:40,156
- So sad. - Yes.

662
00:30:40,396 --> 00:30:42,425
Right. The chef said we should have it downstairs.

663
00:30:42,426 --> 00:30:43,466
- Come here. - So we can drink.

664
00:30:46,966 --> 00:30:48,296
That startled me. Oh, my.

665
00:30:48,297 --> 00:30:50,306
- Gosh. They're already dating. - Seriously. Love is in the air.

666
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:52,306
- Right. Giving her flowers... - I see so much love.

667
00:30:52,307 --> 00:30:53,636
ended up looking like a love confession.

668
00:30:53,637 --> 00:30:55,005
And her accepting that looked like she said yes.

669
00:30:55,006 --> 00:30:56,006
- Right. - Yes.

670
00:30:56,847 --> 00:30:58,446
Then goodnight.

671
00:30:59,176 --> 00:31:01,176
I have a personal matter to deal with tomorrow.

672
00:31:01,676 --> 00:31:03,145
- So... - I'll see you in the afternoon.

673
00:31:03,146 --> 00:31:05,387
In the afternoon. I'll be home around lunch.

674
00:31:06,416 --> 00:31:07,557
Me too.

675
00:31:07,956 --> 00:31:09,156
- Will you be leaving then? - Yes.

676
00:31:09,287 --> 00:31:11,526
- Then why don't we... - Yes, at the venue?

677
00:31:11,527 --> 00:31:13,527
- We can watch it together there. - Yes.

678
00:31:14,097 --> 00:31:15,196
By the way...

679
00:31:16,966 --> 00:31:17,966
I...

680
00:31:20,797 --> 00:31:21,797
Goodnight.

681
00:31:21,996 --> 00:31:23,337
- Sleep tight. - Sleep tight.

682
00:31:28,436 --> 00:31:30,406
- Gosh, I'm getting hungry. - You should add more.

683
00:31:31,176 --> 00:31:32,876
- I like it. - Thank you for the food.

684
00:31:32,877 --> 00:31:34,246
Thank you for the food.

685
00:31:35,117 --> 00:31:36,817
- Isn't this so good? - No way. What is this?

686
00:31:37,416 --> 00:31:38,517
- Isn't that mine? - That's mine.

687
00:31:39,117 --> 00:31:40,215
- That's mine. - Yes.

688
00:31:40,216 --> 00:31:41,387
This is so good.

689
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:44,186
- It's crazy. - Is that so?

690
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:45,985
- This is so good. - Gosh.

691
00:31:45,986 --> 00:31:47,827
- Is that rice? - This is rice.

692
00:31:48,357 --> 00:31:49,955
I feel so competitive right now.

693
00:31:49,956 --> 00:31:51,726
- Yun Jae is so good. - Really?

694
00:31:52,027 --> 00:31:53,935
- His level is so high. - He's on another level.

695
00:31:53,936 --> 00:31:55,337
- So... - He's so good.

696
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:57,306
- Yong Woo, you have a talent too. - His culinary skill...

697
00:31:57,307 --> 00:31:58,307
Yes. He does.

698
00:31:58,308 --> 00:31:59,806
- When you make ramyeon... - He keeps trying out new things.

699
00:31:59,807 --> 00:32:01,307
They all taste good.

700
00:32:01,476 --> 00:32:03,175
- Really? - I should go to sleep.

701
00:32:03,176 --> 00:32:05,107
- Same here. - I need to go to sleep.

702
00:32:05,246 --> 00:32:06,847
I should go to sleep too.

703
00:32:07,317 --> 00:32:09,016
Se Seung, you can wash up first.

704
00:32:09,017 --> 00:32:10,746
- After this... - You said you had to go to sleep.

705
00:32:11,246 --> 00:32:12,517
"I need to go to sleep."

706
00:32:14,017 --> 00:32:15,256
"I need to go to sleep."

707
00:32:15,587 --> 00:32:18,056
- "I need to eat." - I'm acting weird now.

708
00:32:18,057 --> 00:32:19,127
You took a shower, right?

709
00:32:20,426 --> 00:32:21,526
By the way...

710
00:32:21,527 --> 00:32:23,725
- Rest up now. - Go upstairs and rest up.

711
00:32:23,726 --> 00:32:25,827
I'll wash up quickly.

712
00:32:29,236 --> 00:32:30,466
Thank you for the food.

713
00:32:30,767 --> 00:32:32,466
Seeing people enjoy the food makes me happy that I cooked.

714
00:32:33,736 --> 00:32:34,837
(Remembering something)

715
00:32:37,406 --> 00:32:39,607
What's your sister's favorite color?

716
00:32:41,347 --> 00:32:43,047
- Pink? Or red? - Pink?

717
00:32:44,186 --> 00:32:46,387
- Okay. I'll keep that in mind. - What is it? I'm curious.

718
00:32:48,287 --> 00:32:50,087
Pink? A light shade of pastel pink?

719
00:32:51,827 --> 00:32:54,256
She likes pink closer to red.

720
00:32:54,926 --> 00:32:55,926
Thank you.

721
00:32:57,726 --> 00:32:58,726
Okay.

722
00:32:59,726 --> 00:33:01,136
- I asked him. - What?

723
00:33:01,137 --> 00:33:02,936
I asked him about her favorite color for the flowers.

724
00:33:03,396 --> 00:33:04,766
Pink closer to red.

725
00:33:04,767 --> 00:33:05,935
Is she upstairs?

726
00:33:05,936 --> 00:33:07,777
No, I asked Jung Sub.

727
00:33:09,206 --> 00:33:10,206
Are you happy?

728
00:33:11,476 --> 00:33:13,307
She sent you the message today.

729
00:33:14,216 --> 00:33:15,216
What?

730
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:16,676
I guess you guys are hitting it off.

731
00:33:18,587 --> 00:33:21,985
But when was the last time you dated someone with a big age gap?

732
00:33:21,986 --> 00:33:23,486
I was surprised yesterday...

733
00:33:24,027 --> 00:33:25,956
because she looked a lot younger than her age.

734
00:33:26,557 --> 00:33:27,756
But that's it.

735
00:33:28,127 --> 00:33:30,426
So there's nothing... I mean...

736
00:33:32,067 --> 00:33:33,796
Her age doesn't matter.

737
00:33:33,797 --> 00:33:34,797
It didn't affect me at all.

738
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:36,666
"What a surprise." That's all I felt.

739
00:33:37,436 --> 00:33:38,566
That was it.

740
00:33:38,567 --> 00:33:40,307
And she's such a good person.

741
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:42,736
I could sense it when we went on dates.

742
00:33:43,277 --> 00:33:44,377
I'm 30 years old.

743
00:33:44,946 --> 00:33:46,675
Who's going to take a man like me seriously?

744
00:33:46,676 --> 00:33:47,847
Who would want someone like me?

745
00:33:48,476 --> 00:33:49,676
Would you date me if you were her?

746
00:33:51,587 --> 00:33:53,047
So what do you think she's feeling?

747
00:33:55,416 --> 00:33:57,787
I think this can work if I'm a bit braver.

748
00:33:58,057 --> 00:33:59,586
I haven't been brave yet.

749
00:34:00,156 --> 00:34:02,796
So I don't know how to show my interest more actively.

750
00:34:03,026 --> 00:34:04,497
She said she liked bagels.

751
00:34:04,897 --> 00:34:07,497
I could have just bought them and given them to her.

752
00:34:07,937 --> 00:34:09,466
But I bought other bread too.

753
00:34:10,137 --> 00:34:11,906
(He bought bagels Yun Ha liked.)

754
00:34:12,106 --> 00:34:13,466
- What is it? - Have some bread.

755
00:34:13,707 --> 00:34:15,606
This is crazy. Awesome.

756
00:34:18,506 --> 00:34:19,506
Bagels.

757
00:34:21,276 --> 00:34:22,276
I'm saved.

758
00:34:22,577 --> 00:34:25,716
(The bread became food for everyone in the house.)

759
00:34:26,747 --> 00:34:28,086
Is there bread?

760
00:34:28,656 --> 00:34:29,786
It's in the bag over there.

761
00:34:29,787 --> 00:34:31,727
- Did you buy bread? - Yes.

762
00:34:32,156 --> 00:34:33,187
- This? - Yes.

763
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:36,025
I should have this tomorrow...

764
00:34:36,026 --> 00:34:37,125
- before I leave. - Yes. Do that.

765
00:34:37,126 --> 00:34:38,326
I bought that for you to eat before you leave.

766
00:34:38,327 --> 00:34:39,867
Thank you.

767
00:34:43,367 --> 00:34:45,466
I'm not really proactive.

768
00:34:46,606 --> 00:34:47,637
(Sighing)

769
00:34:47,937 --> 00:34:50,775
Well, she said she liked bagels.

770
00:34:50,776 --> 00:34:54,175
Franchise bagels are nice and convenient to buy.

771
00:34:54,176 --> 00:34:57,016
But if you wanted to look good to the girl you were into,

772
00:34:57,017 --> 00:34:59,445
you should have looked up good bagel places...

773
00:34:59,446 --> 00:35:01,315
and bought pretty bagels.

774
00:35:01,316 --> 00:35:03,155
If you were too shy to give them to Yun Ha only,

775
00:35:03,156 --> 00:35:06,085
you could buy a set of six bagels.

776
00:35:06,086 --> 00:35:08,695
"Share these with the other girls."

777
00:35:08,696 --> 00:35:11,826
You could've gotten close to her and said this to her.

778
00:35:11,827 --> 00:35:13,195
- Who... - I walked around for an hour,

779
00:35:13,196 --> 00:35:14,596
- but I couldn't find a bagel place. - Who...

780
00:35:14,597 --> 00:35:16,896
- Who buys one in a plastic bag... - This is not fair.

781
00:35:16,897 --> 00:35:18,136
and say, "Have this."

782
00:35:18,137 --> 00:35:20,266
How would she get a hint?

783
00:35:20,267 --> 00:35:22,206
I walked around for an hour, but I couldn't find a good place.

784
00:35:22,207 --> 00:35:23,536
There was one famous place,

785
00:35:23,537 --> 00:35:25,076
but they didn't have bagels.

786
00:35:25,077 --> 00:35:27,176
They had sweet paste butter bread or something.

787
00:35:30,617 --> 00:35:31,716
Sweet paste butter bread.

788
00:35:31,946 --> 00:35:33,616
This is not sweet paste butter bread's fault.

789
00:35:33,617 --> 00:35:36,017
Isn't it cute how clumsy he is like that?

790
00:35:37,557 --> 00:35:39,926
Let me listen to you now. What did you want to say earlier?

791
00:35:40,426 --> 00:35:43,057
I wasn't sure who texted me.

792
00:35:43,296 --> 00:35:44,827
Well, who do you like?

793
00:35:45,126 --> 00:35:48,196
Who do I like? Well, the person I'm curious about...

794
00:35:48,537 --> 00:35:49,596
is Jae Hyung, though.

795
00:35:49,597 --> 00:35:50,835
We don't have much time left,

796
00:35:50,836 --> 00:35:52,437
so you can't just be curious about him.

797
00:35:52,566 --> 00:35:56,006
But I can't just express my interest in him.

798
00:35:56,106 --> 00:35:57,546
We haven't even talked.

799
00:35:57,707 --> 00:36:00,176
I'm surely into Yun Ha, though.

800
00:36:00,446 --> 00:36:02,416
I'm curious about Jae Hyung,

801
00:36:02,417 --> 00:36:05,286
but our timing didn't match,

802
00:36:05,287 --> 00:36:07,887
so it made me feel tired emotionally.

803
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:13,756
Then he suddenly texted me today.

804
00:36:16,426 --> 00:36:18,227
What did I say earlier? Red...

805
00:36:20,836 --> 00:36:22,497
Pink close to red?

806
00:36:23,336 --> 00:36:26,767
(Pink close to red)

807
00:36:27,276 --> 00:36:29,006
What is with him?

808
00:36:29,106 --> 00:36:30,875
Ji Won just started talking.

809
00:36:30,876 --> 00:36:32,576
She's talking to him,

810
00:36:32,577 --> 00:36:34,675
and he's writing that down...

811
00:36:34,676 --> 00:36:35,676
in case he forgets it.

812
00:36:35,677 --> 00:36:37,787
- He only talked about himself. - "Listen to her."

813
00:36:40,187 --> 00:36:41,316
Red...

814
00:36:41,417 --> 00:36:43,187
Pink close to red?

815
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:45,986
I'm sorry, but what are you doing?

816
00:36:47,126 --> 00:36:48,356
I'm sorry.

817
00:36:49,256 --> 00:36:50,327
My bad.

818
00:36:51,267 --> 00:36:52,526
Let's continue talking.

819
00:36:53,667 --> 00:36:54,695
What are you going to do now?

820
00:36:54,696 --> 00:36:56,997
If you make me say this again,

821
00:36:57,066 --> 00:36:59,307
- I will stop talking to you. - Okay.

822
00:36:59,707 --> 00:37:00,707
Fine.

823
00:37:02,176 --> 00:37:03,945
You don't make an effort either.

824
00:37:03,946 --> 00:37:06,675
I'm not sure if I'm into him enough...

825
00:37:06,676 --> 00:37:08,876
to make an effort.

826
00:37:09,077 --> 00:37:11,686
I suddenly really like him...

827
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:12,985
- and want to get to know him, - That's true.

828
00:37:12,986 --> 00:37:14,456
so I ask him out?

829
00:37:14,457 --> 00:37:17,655
You know my personality, so you know I'm not like that.

830
00:37:17,656 --> 00:37:18,727
But...

831
00:37:19,626 --> 00:37:20,626
Yun Ha is cute.

832
00:37:21,827 --> 00:37:23,227
- Gosh. - Goodness.

833
00:37:24,066 --> 00:37:25,125
Oh, dear.

834
00:37:25,126 --> 00:37:27,897
Maybe she shouldn't share her worries with him.

835
00:37:28,637 --> 00:37:30,637
He's just like Jonathan. He's not paying attention.

836
00:37:30,937 --> 00:37:31,966
What is he doing?

837
00:37:32,606 --> 00:37:34,006
Just go to sleep.

838
00:37:35,207 --> 00:37:36,236
Yun Ha is cute.

839
00:37:37,477 --> 00:37:38,506
What's wrong with you?

840
00:37:39,876 --> 00:37:40,977
I'm just saying.

841
00:37:43,617 --> 00:37:45,387
It's still fascinating, though.

842
00:37:45,546 --> 00:37:46,585
What?

843
00:37:46,586 --> 00:37:47,986
When I showed up,

844
00:37:48,086 --> 00:37:50,425
you chose her for him.

845
00:37:50,426 --> 00:37:51,426
What about you?

846
00:37:51,626 --> 00:37:53,557
- What? - What about you?

847
00:37:54,597 --> 00:37:56,827
You're not helpful at all. You have no idea even now.

848
00:37:58,696 --> 00:38:00,326
Honestly, I don't know.

849
00:38:00,327 --> 00:38:01,666
You're just not interested.

850
00:38:01,667 --> 00:38:03,867
You're only talking about yourself even now.

851
00:38:04,066 --> 00:38:06,506
Since you're not interested at all.

852
00:38:09,176 --> 00:38:11,605
I can't tell who you're into.

853
00:38:11,606 --> 00:38:14,445
You don't really let it show, but I do.

854
00:38:14,446 --> 00:38:16,445
No. How would I have known who you liked at first?

855
00:38:16,446 --> 00:38:18,686
I thought about what type of person you would like...

856
00:38:18,687 --> 00:38:21,387
and get along with, so I knew.

857
00:38:28,827 --> 00:38:31,096
I had to choose your date for Gangwon Province.

858
00:38:31,097 --> 00:38:34,335
You know you're not really proactive.

859
00:38:34,336 --> 00:38:36,996
I know why you choose Cheol Hyeon for me.

860
00:38:36,997 --> 00:38:38,266
- It... - Did I say I didn't like it?

861
00:38:38,267 --> 00:38:40,235
No. It didn't mind it.

862
00:38:40,236 --> 00:38:43,436
I got to talk to him so I learned a lot about him.

863
00:38:43,437 --> 00:38:44,876
I had a good time.

864
00:38:45,006 --> 00:38:46,476
That's not what I'm talking about.

865
00:38:46,477 --> 00:38:48,276
I'm talking about now.

866
00:38:49,316 --> 00:38:51,846
I just don't know what you're doing...

867
00:38:51,847 --> 00:38:53,017
if I'm being honest.

868
00:38:53,647 --> 00:38:55,355
I got a message,

869
00:38:55,356 --> 00:38:56,386
saying you have been chosen,

870
00:38:56,387 --> 00:38:58,886
but I couldn't really understand today.

871
00:38:58,887 --> 00:39:01,227
Jae Hyung and you hadn't even spent time together.

872
00:39:01,626 --> 00:39:03,256
That's not what I'm talking about.

873
00:39:04,966 --> 00:39:08,396
I'm talking about how I was telling you about what was bothering me...

874
00:39:08,397 --> 00:39:11,006
and you were not listening.

875
00:39:14,106 --> 00:39:15,536
What were you saying? Tell me.

876
00:39:15,537 --> 00:39:17,545
What was it about? Go on.

877
00:39:17,546 --> 00:39:20,477
If I remember, I'll make sense of it now.

878
00:39:20,577 --> 00:39:21,647
Okay?

879
00:39:23,417 --> 00:39:24,916
If you're not going to tell me here now,

880
00:39:24,917 --> 00:39:26,647
don't say that to me again.

881
00:39:28,816 --> 00:39:30,315
- Tell me. - I was telling you...

882
00:39:30,316 --> 00:39:32,886
about the text I received,

883
00:39:32,887 --> 00:39:34,796
but you didn't respond at all.

884
00:39:35,296 --> 00:39:36,556
Okay. What was I doing then?

885
00:39:36,557 --> 00:39:38,726
That's why I came down here to talk to you again.

886
00:39:38,727 --> 00:39:40,096
- Right. - I waited to talk to you...

887
00:39:40,097 --> 00:39:41,795
- until everyone left. - So I'm trying to listen.

888
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:44,636
- So I was telling you about it... - But it didn't go like that.

889
00:39:44,637 --> 00:39:45,835
Look.

890
00:39:45,836 --> 00:39:47,806
I listened to you so I could tell you about myself.

891
00:39:47,807 --> 00:39:49,106
While talking about myself...

892
00:39:49,606 --> 00:39:51,546
It'd be better to stop talking.

893
00:39:56,847 --> 00:39:58,517
Gosh. Let's stop talking.

894
00:40:05,227 --> 00:40:06,926
(Sighing)

895
00:40:15,296 --> 00:40:17,436
When Ji Won received a text from Jae Hyung,

896
00:40:17,437 --> 00:40:19,766
I had no thoughts about it.

897
00:40:19,767 --> 00:40:21,436
She got sad...

898
00:40:21,437 --> 00:40:23,946
about my indifference and went upstairs.

899
00:40:24,276 --> 00:40:26,905
I don't see why she got upset.

900
00:40:26,906 --> 00:40:29,016
It's really hard for me to understand...

901
00:40:29,017 --> 00:40:30,946
if she doesn't tell me why she got mad in detail.

902
00:40:31,287 --> 00:40:33,747
I wish she just told me everything.

903
00:40:33,986 --> 00:40:35,187
But she doesn't.

904
00:40:36,086 --> 00:40:38,856
I got a text from Jae Hyung,

905
00:40:38,926 --> 00:40:41,996
so I wanted to talk about it with Yun Jae.

906
00:40:41,997 --> 00:40:43,625
I thought...

907
00:40:43,626 --> 00:40:45,526
only my sibling could give me energy.

908
00:40:45,626 --> 00:40:48,896
So I waited until everyone went upstairs...

909
00:40:48,897 --> 00:40:52,207
and finally had a time to talk with him.

910
00:40:54,676 --> 00:40:56,076
I was telling him about myself,

911
00:40:56,077 --> 00:40:59,476
and he didn't respond to that but talked about himself.

912
00:40:59,477 --> 00:41:00,976
"Yun Ha is cute."

913
00:41:00,977 --> 00:41:02,545
He would just say this.

914
00:41:02,546 --> 00:41:04,747
"Is he even listening to me?"

915
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:09,255
I'm so happy that things are going well between them,

916
00:41:09,256 --> 00:41:12,526
but he could've listened to me at that moment.

917
00:41:12,957 --> 00:41:14,126
I was upset.

918
00:41:22,537 --> 00:41:24,867
- Do you have a lot on your mind? - Yes.

919
00:41:26,307 --> 00:41:27,906
I fought with Yun Jae.

920
00:41:29,506 --> 00:41:30,807
We just can't talk.

921
00:41:52,926 --> 00:41:55,796
(Cheol Hyeon)

922
00:41:58,707 --> 00:42:00,537
(Ju Yeon)

923
00:42:03,336 --> 00:42:05,847
(Jung Sub)

924
00:42:07,876 --> 00:42:09,446
(Se Seung)

925
00:42:12,617 --> 00:42:14,187
(Cho A)

926
00:42:16,716 --> 00:42:18,756
(Yun Ha)

927
00:42:21,696 --> 00:42:23,397
(Jae Hyung)

928
00:42:26,696 --> 00:42:27,966
(Yong Woo)

929
00:42:32,267 --> 00:42:33,637
(Ji Won)

930
00:42:38,006 --> 00:42:39,707
(Yun Jae)

931
00:42:44,117 --> 00:42:49,287
(My Sibling's Romance)

932
00:42:50,457 --> 00:42:55,897
(Episode 10: Confirmation)

933
00:42:56,756 --> 00:43:00,727
(The morning is already here.)

934
00:43:01,097 --> 00:43:02,196
Hello.

935
00:43:02,367 --> 00:43:03,966
Hello.

936
00:43:04,106 --> 00:43:06,266
I'm so excited about your performance today.

937
00:43:06,267 --> 00:43:07,576
(Yun Ha has a performance today.)

938
00:43:07,577 --> 00:43:09,105
Don't expect too much.

939
00:43:09,106 --> 00:43:10,736
How did your date go with Yun Jae?

940
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:13,445
It was good. He was really shy.

941
00:43:13,446 --> 00:43:16,675
He said he hadn't been on a date in three years.

942
00:43:16,676 --> 00:43:18,147
That's true.

943
00:43:18,586 --> 00:43:21,516
Does he take good care of you?

944
00:43:21,517 --> 00:43:22,957
Yes, he really does.

945
00:43:23,216 --> 00:43:25,387
- He's really sweet. - He is?

946
00:43:25,787 --> 00:43:28,625
I felt that he was a warm-hearted person.

947
00:43:28,626 --> 00:43:30,296
- Really? - Yes.

948
00:43:30,397 --> 00:43:32,296
Is it someone I don't know?

949
00:43:32,867 --> 00:43:33,966
Warm-hearted?

950
00:43:34,736 --> 00:43:37,336
He was really sweet.

951
00:43:37,637 --> 00:43:38,666
I'm glad.

952
00:43:38,667 --> 00:43:40,806
He's also super frank.

953
00:43:40,807 --> 00:43:42,005
Right.

954
00:43:42,006 --> 00:43:45,505
I like that he's honest.

955
00:43:45,506 --> 00:43:46,546
I see.

956
00:43:46,647 --> 00:43:49,916
Even from the start, I thought...

957
00:43:49,917 --> 00:43:51,347
it'd be nice...

958
00:43:52,117 --> 00:43:56,456
if he could go on lots of dates with you when he first came.

959
00:43:56,457 --> 00:43:57,556
I see.

960
00:43:57,557 --> 00:43:58,687
I could feel it right away.

961
00:43:59,986 --> 00:44:01,696
- That you'd lead him well. - Is that so?

962
00:44:02,696 --> 00:44:06,066
- You thought we'd get along. - "She'd see him in a good light."

963
00:44:06,296 --> 00:44:07,596
That's what you thought.

964
00:44:07,597 --> 00:44:10,465
I thought you'd laugh it off even if he made a mistake.

965
00:44:10,466 --> 00:44:11,636
Right.

966
00:44:11,637 --> 00:44:14,065
I believed you'd calm him...

967
00:44:14,066 --> 00:44:16,875
if he got flustered.

968
00:44:16,876 --> 00:44:18,576
Right. You know you kind of break down...

969
00:44:18,577 --> 00:44:21,247
when you go on your first date.

970
00:44:21,676 --> 00:44:22,676
Right.

971
00:44:22,677 --> 00:44:24,617
He was trembling his hands a lot.

972
00:44:26,687 --> 00:44:27,716
That's so funny.

973
00:44:28,256 --> 00:44:31,226
I was really nervous on my first date too.

974
00:44:31,227 --> 00:44:33,826
- I know. I heard a rumor... - Right.

975
00:44:33,827 --> 00:44:36,296
- that you styled his hair quietly. - Yes.

976
00:44:36,856 --> 00:44:39,926
I styled his hair and put makeup on him.

977
00:44:40,196 --> 00:44:43,296
He told me about those things. It was fun.

978
00:44:43,637 --> 00:44:45,105
I feel bad for Ji Won.

979
00:44:45,106 --> 00:44:47,905
She hates him now but still supports him.

980
00:44:47,906 --> 00:44:49,477
It's like she's his mother.

981
00:44:49,606 --> 00:44:51,146
She has a teenage son,

982
00:44:51,147 --> 00:44:53,206
but she tries to put in a good word.

983
00:44:53,207 --> 00:44:54,917
- "My kid is nice, though." - Right.

984
00:44:55,376 --> 00:44:57,076
What time do you leave?

985
00:44:57,077 --> 00:44:59,086
I should leave soon.

986
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:04,327
(Yun Ha goes to work to prepare for her performance.)

987
00:45:06,387 --> 00:45:08,227
(Yong Woo got out of the shower.)

988
00:45:09,156 --> 00:45:11,796
(Jung Sub who took a nap in the living room wakes up.)

989
00:45:12,327 --> 00:45:13,727
(Spotting Jung Sub)

990
00:45:14,566 --> 00:45:16,867
(Hiding behind the pillar)

991
00:45:22,937 --> 00:45:25,206
- Did you sleep well? - I did, and you?

992
00:45:25,207 --> 00:45:26,247
I slept well.

993
00:45:26,577 --> 00:45:28,816
And this...

994
00:45:29,676 --> 00:45:31,216
(Glancing over)

995
00:45:31,316 --> 00:45:32,887
- Good morning. - Are you going to work?

996
00:45:35,256 --> 00:45:36,316
We should pack.

997
00:45:37,417 --> 00:45:38,727
(Ji Won passes by without responding.)

998
00:45:40,557 --> 00:45:42,355
I can read her face well.

999
00:45:42,356 --> 00:45:43,925
If she has a stern look on her face,

1000
00:45:43,926 --> 00:45:45,496
I don't talk to her that day.

1001
00:45:45,497 --> 00:45:47,767
She didn't seem to want to talk today.

1002
00:45:59,207 --> 00:46:01,746
He didn't seem...

1003
00:46:01,747 --> 00:46:04,117
at ease either.

1004
00:46:05,147 --> 00:46:08,057
(Ji Won left the living room.)

1005
00:46:10,816 --> 00:46:13,755
(Yun Jae also went outside.)

1006
00:46:13,756 --> 00:46:15,497
(That afternoon)

1007
00:46:15,696 --> 00:46:17,997
Did something happen between you and Yun Jae yesterday?

1008
00:46:18,196 --> 00:46:20,826
No. I didn't fight with him.

1009
00:46:20,827 --> 00:46:22,795
- But you almost did? - We almost fought, so I came up.

1010
00:46:22,796 --> 00:46:24,366
- It wasn't too serious, right? - No.

1011
00:46:24,367 --> 00:46:26,506
- Well, we always fight. - Right.

1012
00:46:26,767 --> 00:46:28,936
Siblings always fight.

1013
00:46:28,937 --> 00:46:31,076
- My brother and I... - Did you two fight?

1014
00:46:31,077 --> 00:46:33,045
- I thought we would, but we didn't. - You didn't?

1015
00:46:33,046 --> 00:46:34,617
Isn't that normal, though?

1016
00:46:34,747 --> 00:46:37,647
Even though you fight back home, but you don't fight here.

1017
00:46:38,716 --> 00:46:39,916
Well, you never know.

1018
00:46:39,917 --> 00:46:42,085
You get used to staying here.

1019
00:46:42,086 --> 00:46:43,086
Right.

1020
00:46:43,216 --> 00:46:45,526
You might get worked up from time to time.

1021
00:46:47,557 --> 00:46:48,557
That's true.

1022
00:46:48,756 --> 00:46:51,396
(Are there any siblings you're jealous of?)

1023
00:46:51,397 --> 00:46:52,926
First,

1024
00:46:53,167 --> 00:46:57,536
I don't even expect Yun Jae to be like Jung Sub or Cheol Hyeon.

1025
00:46:57,537 --> 00:47:00,636
He could be like Jae Hyung at least.

1026
00:47:00,637 --> 00:47:02,336
Jae Hyung and Se Seung are siblings that bicker too.

1027
00:47:02,537 --> 00:47:06,506
But Jae Hyung looks for her a lot.

1028
00:47:06,776 --> 00:47:09,315
But he doesn't look for her...

1029
00:47:09,316 --> 00:47:11,886
like my brother does with me when he needs something.

1030
00:47:11,887 --> 00:47:14,387
He would come to our room...

1031
00:47:14,486 --> 00:47:17,355
to remind her of something.

1032
00:47:17,356 --> 00:47:20,726
Or he would ask to see her...

1033
00:47:20,727 --> 00:47:23,557
to check on her feelings.

1034
00:47:23,827 --> 00:47:26,096
I thought it'd be nice...

1035
00:47:26,097 --> 00:47:28,597
if our siblings could be like them at least.

1036
00:47:28,796 --> 00:47:31,307
I didn't expect this kind of problem.

1037
00:47:31,707 --> 00:47:33,766
They should help each other here.

1038
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:36,676
It's hard enough to focus on her romance here,

1039
00:47:36,906 --> 00:47:38,945
- and her brother doesn't help. - This is so...

1040
00:47:38,946 --> 00:47:40,246
Her brother isn't obviously as nice to her...

1041
00:47:40,247 --> 00:47:41,945
as other brothers are to their siblings.

1042
00:47:41,946 --> 00:47:43,517
- Right. She must be so upset. - Right.

1043
00:47:43,676 --> 00:47:44,846
She didn't realize it when they were alone,

1044
00:47:44,847 --> 00:47:46,445
but now she does...

1045
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:47,816
- because she sees other brothers. - Right.

1046
00:47:53,327 --> 00:47:57,426
(Ji Won is deep in thought.)

1047
00:48:11,446 --> 00:48:15,216
(Tears flow down again.)

1048
00:48:24,856 --> 00:48:29,827
Actually, I'm quite easygoing.

1049
00:48:30,026 --> 00:48:35,396
I learned not to get hurt,

1050
00:48:35,397 --> 00:48:37,965
so my feelings don't get hurt that much.

1051
00:48:37,966 --> 00:48:40,267
But when it comes to my brother,

1052
00:48:40,506 --> 00:48:42,405
I constantly get hurt...

1053
00:48:42,406 --> 00:48:44,307
and upset.

1054
00:48:44,647 --> 00:48:47,307
In a way,

1055
00:48:48,276 --> 00:48:51,646
it means I truly love him as family.

1056
00:48:51,647 --> 00:48:53,085
That's what I thought.

1057
00:48:53,086 --> 00:48:55,456
I always have...

1058
00:48:55,457 --> 00:48:58,256
some expectations from him...

1059
00:48:58,387 --> 00:49:01,557
so I believe that's why...

1060
00:49:01,756 --> 00:49:05,667
I get disappointed or upset by him.

1061
00:49:05,897 --> 00:49:07,666
"Why doesn't he hold me dear?"

1062
00:49:07,667 --> 00:49:09,666
I rarely cry, but when I did,

1063
00:49:09,667 --> 00:49:12,167
it was often because of him.

1064
00:49:12,367 --> 00:49:15,506
Because he really made me upset.

1065
00:49:16,776 --> 00:49:20,276
He keeps saying we're not interested in each other.

1066
00:49:20,647 --> 00:49:23,417
But even before he came,

1067
00:49:23,617 --> 00:49:26,315
I couldn't wait to see...

1068
00:49:26,316 --> 00:49:27,517
who he would click with.

1069
00:49:28,117 --> 00:49:30,386
(The first day her brother came)

1070
00:49:30,387 --> 00:49:31,957
Even when he came,

1071
00:49:32,526 --> 00:49:35,457
I was still excited.

1072
00:49:37,256 --> 00:49:38,266
(Late at night when they came back to Seoul)

1073
00:49:38,267 --> 00:49:40,496
Even on the night he first came to the house...

1074
00:49:40,497 --> 00:49:44,706
(Ji Won gathered the participants so he could get along with them.)

1075
00:49:44,707 --> 00:49:47,806
I wanted to gather you so he could talk to you.

1076
00:49:47,807 --> 00:49:50,675
Thankfully, you all came here.

1077
00:49:50,676 --> 00:49:55,617
I wanted to help him adjust quickly,

1078
00:49:56,017 --> 00:49:59,886
so I stayed with him all night.

1079
00:49:59,887 --> 00:50:02,386
He tends to be shy...

1080
00:50:02,387 --> 00:50:05,327
around strangers,

1081
00:50:05,557 --> 00:50:10,056
so when we meet new people,

1082
00:50:10,057 --> 00:50:11,666
he feels at ease...

1083
00:50:11,667 --> 00:50:13,795
when I'm around him.

1084
00:50:13,796 --> 00:50:16,767
Since we were little, we'd play these roles...

1085
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:20,867
whenever we were in a similar situation.

1086
00:50:21,037 --> 00:50:22,576
It's like our own play.

1087
00:50:22,577 --> 00:50:25,147
I'm the younger sibling who is strong,

1088
00:50:25,546 --> 00:50:30,046
and he's the older sibling who is afraid of me.

1089
00:50:30,276 --> 00:50:33,616
We tell this to people,

1090
00:50:33,617 --> 00:50:36,457
set a playful mood, and make people more relaxed.

1091
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:38,826
He whined about it...

1092
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:40,925
when he was a kid,

1093
00:50:40,926 --> 00:50:43,025
but he started to enjoy it at some point.

1094
00:50:43,026 --> 00:50:45,766
He even called me an older sister.

1095
00:50:45,767 --> 00:50:48,066
(I'm the first son, but I think she's the one.)

1096
00:50:48,637 --> 00:50:50,296
(I'm the first "son?")

1097
00:50:51,367 --> 00:50:52,866
(You're older than her.)

1098
00:50:52,867 --> 00:50:55,037
(I am, but she's like my older sister.)

1099
00:50:56,276 --> 00:50:57,976
(I already read it out loud. Why are you reading it again?)

1100
00:50:57,977 --> 00:50:59,006
(Put it down.)

1101
00:50:59,906 --> 00:51:00,946
(Be quiet.)

1102
00:51:02,117 --> 00:51:03,175
She's charismatic.

1103
00:51:03,176 --> 00:51:06,545
(Even when they studied abroad,)

1104
00:51:06,546 --> 00:51:11,287
(she settled first and helped him adjust to the new environment.)

1105
00:51:11,426 --> 00:51:15,597
(It repeated in this house as well.)

1106
00:51:15,856 --> 00:51:17,695
I do these things...

1107
00:51:17,696 --> 00:51:22,065
and help him relax around other people.

1108
00:51:22,066 --> 00:51:24,706
Now that he feels at ease,

1109
00:51:24,707 --> 00:51:27,666
and his heart is fluttering,

1110
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:32,207
he's not curious about how things are going for me...

1111
00:51:32,676 --> 00:51:34,577
or worried about me at all.

1112
00:51:34,917 --> 00:51:36,747
He treats others so well.

1113
00:51:36,917 --> 00:51:39,116
I know this. He's really nice to others.

1114
00:51:39,117 --> 00:51:40,986
He takes good care of his girlfriend too.

1115
00:51:41,486 --> 00:51:42,585
Do you want to cover yourself with this?

1116
00:51:42,586 --> 00:51:44,215
Thank you.

1117
00:51:44,216 --> 00:51:46,155
He likes taking care of people.

1118
00:51:46,156 --> 00:51:47,485
The tofu is small, so you could eat it in one go.

1119
00:51:47,486 --> 00:51:49,456
Okay. Thanks.

1120
00:51:49,457 --> 00:51:51,097
- It's good. - It's delicious, right?

1121
00:51:51,296 --> 00:51:52,726
I never expected it,

1122
00:51:52,727 --> 00:51:56,066
but watching other siblings,

1123
00:51:57,867 --> 00:51:59,936
I thought I wanted to lean on his shoulder too.

1124
00:51:59,937 --> 00:52:01,675
(She wanted to lean on him once.)

1125
00:52:01,676 --> 00:52:02,707
That's what I thought.

1126
00:52:04,876 --> 00:52:10,077
(That's why she was hurt.)

1127
00:52:17,917 --> 00:52:19,457
Since when I was little,

1128
00:52:19,887 --> 00:52:23,926
I had to take care of him many times.

1129
00:52:24,026 --> 00:52:27,726
I think I was better at enduring it when I was little.

1130
00:52:27,727 --> 00:52:31,537
When I was little, I just loved my mom so much.

1131
00:52:31,807 --> 00:52:35,106
Her feelings were my priority.

1132
00:52:35,207 --> 00:52:38,676
So I thought it'd be nice if I helped her...

1133
00:52:38,776 --> 00:52:40,606
and took care of him together.

1134
00:52:40,707 --> 00:52:42,517
It was the most important thing to me.

1135
00:52:43,046 --> 00:52:47,187
Maybe it was good child syndrome.

1136
00:52:47,446 --> 00:52:51,426
Actually, I'm very weak.

1137
00:52:51,887 --> 00:52:56,526
And I always want to lean on someone.

1138
00:52:57,156 --> 00:53:00,795
When I was already having a hard time...

1139
00:53:00,796 --> 00:53:04,707
when I argued with him. I think that's why I was very upset.

1140
00:53:10,106 --> 00:53:15,276
(Ji Won calms down by herself.)

1141
00:53:22,086 --> 00:53:24,517
- She thinks about him a lot. - Yes.

1142
00:53:25,057 --> 00:53:26,826
- I agree. - That's why she's more upset.

1143
00:53:26,827 --> 00:53:28,195
She's a younger sister,

1144
00:53:28,196 --> 00:53:30,227
so she wants to lean on her older brother.

1145
00:53:30,327 --> 00:53:33,566
But he was treated like her younger brother growing up.

1146
00:53:34,126 --> 00:53:35,835
Because of such contradiction,

1147
00:53:35,836 --> 00:53:37,667
her emotions exploded.

1148
00:53:37,997 --> 00:53:40,867
What she's feeling is how the eldest children feel.

1149
00:53:41,437 --> 00:53:43,206
But interestingly,

1150
00:53:43,207 --> 00:53:45,046
it's the younger sibling who feels that way.

1151
00:53:45,477 --> 00:53:47,976
I hope these two...

1152
00:53:47,977 --> 00:53:51,486
can solve these sensitive and private issues...

1153
00:53:51,586 --> 00:53:55,085
they can't talk to anyone by watching...

1154
00:53:55,086 --> 00:53:57,755
- other sibling relationships. - Right.

1155
00:53:57,756 --> 00:53:59,085
- I hope it turns out well. - I think it will...

1156
00:53:59,086 --> 00:54:00,426
if they watch this.

1157
00:54:00,856 --> 00:54:03,396
She's been very stressed out.

1158
00:54:03,397 --> 00:54:06,396
- Ji Won has no one to lean on now. - Right.

1159
00:54:06,397 --> 00:54:07,397
And it's not like...

1160
00:54:15,236 --> 00:54:17,876
(Meanwhile, Jae Hyung comes to Se Seung.)

1161
00:54:18,077 --> 00:54:19,375
- Talk to me. - About what?

1162
00:54:19,376 --> 00:54:21,847
We didn't finish our conversation yesterday.

1163
00:54:22,077 --> 00:54:24,546
(He closes the door first as his sister said.)

1164
00:54:24,747 --> 00:54:26,546
She never texted me.

1165
00:54:26,647 --> 00:54:28,656
That's because she didn't have a chance.

1166
00:54:29,216 --> 00:54:30,886
There was nothing going on between you two, right?

1167
00:54:30,887 --> 00:54:32,227
- No. - You didn't go on a date either.

1168
00:54:33,126 --> 00:54:36,326
And she has no one...

1169
00:54:36,327 --> 00:54:38,426
to get to know properly now.

1170
00:54:38,526 --> 00:54:40,626
This is really cute. It's a rabbit.

1171
00:54:40,926 --> 00:54:41,997
(Patting)

1172
00:54:42,097 --> 00:54:45,137
You just think you'll never have feelings for her, don't you?

1173
00:54:47,236 --> 00:54:48,576
- Right. - You do?

1174
00:54:48,577 --> 00:54:49,606
I think you're right.

1175
00:54:49,707 --> 00:54:53,077
So I don't want to text her to give her false hope.

1176
00:54:53,176 --> 00:54:54,477
Why did she text me, though?

1177
00:54:54,577 --> 00:54:56,647
I guess she thought you were cool when you were singing.

1178
00:54:56,977 --> 00:54:59,116
But... Oh, right. You don't know what she wrote.

1179
00:54:59,117 --> 00:55:00,716
- What did she write? - "It's a pity."

1180
00:55:00,816 --> 00:55:02,586
That's all. "It's a pity."

1181
00:55:02,687 --> 00:55:05,356
What did you write to her then?

1182
00:55:05,887 --> 00:55:07,756
"You have such a nice voice."

1183
00:55:08,196 --> 00:55:10,696
"The wool jacket was so cute too."

1184
00:55:10,827 --> 00:55:12,526
What wool jacket?

1185
00:55:12,727 --> 00:55:15,537
It was displayed here, and I tried it on.

1186
00:55:15,897 --> 00:55:17,167
- So you hinted that it was you. - Yes.

1187
00:55:18,066 --> 00:55:19,066
You did?

1188
00:55:19,067 --> 00:55:21,735
Then you do have some feelings, don't you?

1189
00:55:21,736 --> 00:55:22,736
Well...

1190
00:55:25,406 --> 00:55:27,576
Didn't you two talk on the first floor yesterday?

1191
00:55:27,577 --> 00:55:29,215
We were just talking about funny things.

1192
00:55:29,216 --> 00:55:30,546
I get along with her.

1193
00:55:31,647 --> 00:55:32,716
She won't get along with me then.

1194
00:55:32,986 --> 00:55:34,917
(His conclusion is annoying.)

1195
00:55:35,117 --> 00:55:36,287
You're so annoying.

1196
00:55:36,957 --> 00:55:38,625
(He doesn't care and leaves without hesitation.)

1197
00:55:38,626 --> 00:55:42,526
Without a sound

1198
00:55:44,397 --> 00:55:46,796
(It's already evening.)

1199
00:55:48,537 --> 00:55:50,796
(Yun Jae leaves home by himself.)

1200
00:55:55,537 --> 00:55:58,207
(He's going somewhere secretly.)

1201
00:55:58,807 --> 00:56:01,676
(His lips are dry.)

1202
00:56:01,917 --> 00:56:02,917
His lips are dry.

1203
00:56:03,077 --> 00:56:04,516
Is he going to the famous bagel place?

1204
00:56:04,517 --> 00:56:05,716
I think so.

1205
00:56:05,917 --> 00:56:08,016
- I think it's a flower shop. - It's a flower shop.

1206
00:56:08,017 --> 00:56:09,386
- Before the concert. - It's a cafe.

1207
00:56:09,387 --> 00:56:11,117
I think he's going to buy flowers before the concert.

1208
00:56:12,026 --> 00:56:15,097
(He arrived at this place with dry lips.)

1209
00:56:20,526 --> 00:56:22,036
- That's... - He's organizing even that?

1210
00:56:22,037 --> 00:56:24,695
- Why would he organize it? - Hold on.

1211
00:56:24,696 --> 00:56:27,565
Why would he organize a standing signboard at a store?

1212
00:56:27,566 --> 00:56:30,106
- Just listen to your sister. - I mean...

1213
00:56:30,477 --> 00:56:32,406
Take care of her as much as you take care of that signboard.

1214
00:56:33,477 --> 00:56:36,117
(He can't not organize the standing signboard.)

1215
00:56:36,276 --> 00:56:39,117
I prepared flowers.

1216
00:56:39,417 --> 00:56:40,517
I don't know about flowers,

1217
00:56:40,787 --> 00:56:43,486
but I asked for all the pink flowers that are pretty.

1218
00:56:43,557 --> 00:56:45,585
There's water under the flowers.

1219
00:56:45,586 --> 00:56:47,326
- So don't put it upside down. - Okay.

1220
00:56:47,327 --> 00:56:48,956
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1221
00:56:48,957 --> 00:56:50,057
- Bye. - Bye.

1222
00:56:52,966 --> 00:56:53,966
Careful.

1223
00:56:54,626 --> 00:56:56,167
(While he got a pretty pink bouquet,)

1224
00:56:56,397 --> 00:56:57,496
You mean those cars?

1225
00:56:57,497 --> 00:56:59,406
(the others are going to the concert venue.)

1226
00:57:00,167 --> 00:57:01,977
I think we can be divided into groups of 3 and 4.

1227
00:57:02,077 --> 00:57:03,706
- Okay. - Let's do that.

1228
00:57:03,707 --> 00:57:05,807
- Get your crayon. - Crayon.

1229
00:57:08,517 --> 00:57:10,417
Which car should I take?

1230
00:57:11,716 --> 00:57:13,117
I should get in here.

1231
00:57:15,387 --> 00:57:20,756
(Ji Won sits next to Jae Hyung.)

1232
00:57:22,727 --> 00:57:24,496
Ji Won sat next to me.

1233
00:57:24,497 --> 00:57:26,196
It did feel a little different...

1234
00:57:26,566 --> 00:57:29,437
from usual. It was different from before.

1235
00:57:29,767 --> 00:57:33,537
In a way, I wanted her to sit next to me.

1236
00:57:38,506 --> 00:57:39,776
(Glancing)

1237
00:57:40,776 --> 00:57:42,376
Someone turned on the seat heating.

1238
00:57:42,477 --> 00:57:44,876
- I did. - You did? Thank you.

1239
00:57:45,716 --> 00:57:47,085
- But I... - She did it just now.

1240
00:57:47,086 --> 00:57:49,355
- That's so sweet. - Oh, right. You often feel hot.

1241
00:57:49,356 --> 00:57:52,356
- Yes. So I don't turn it on. - He never turns it on.

1242
00:57:52,557 --> 00:57:54,287
I often feel hot.

1243
00:57:54,526 --> 00:57:57,196
So I can't turn on the seat heating even in winter.

1244
00:57:57,497 --> 00:57:59,096
I was like, "Who turned on the seat heating?"

1245
00:57:59,097 --> 00:58:01,126
Then I switched it to cooling.

1246
00:58:01,426 --> 00:58:04,436
And Ji Won suddenly said, "I turned it on."

1247
00:58:04,437 --> 00:58:06,566
It was a little awkward.

1248
00:58:07,106 --> 00:58:08,376
How about you?

1249
00:58:08,736 --> 00:58:11,005
- Jung Sub... - I also feel hot.

1250
00:58:11,006 --> 00:58:13,005
- I'll turn it off then. - No.

1251
00:58:13,006 --> 00:58:15,347
I started liking it these days.

1252
00:58:16,376 --> 00:58:18,715
- You're good. - Why?

1253
00:58:18,716 --> 00:58:19,746
You should learn.

1254
00:58:19,747 --> 00:58:21,247
I'll give you another chance.

1255
00:58:21,716 --> 00:58:22,816
He turned it on.

1256
00:58:24,086 --> 00:58:27,126
- Today, I'm going to burn. - That's the warmest mode.

1257
00:58:28,897 --> 00:58:30,195
- He's going to burn. - That's the warmest mode.

1258
00:58:30,196 --> 00:58:31,497
- Are you going to burn today? - I'll turn on the seat cooling.

1259
00:58:32,796 --> 00:58:34,167
- Are you allowing it? - Yes.

1260
00:58:35,367 --> 00:58:36,667
I'm so excited.

1261
00:58:36,767 --> 00:58:38,836
Me too. I'm excited for no reason.

1262
00:58:58,626 --> 00:59:00,727
I haven't been to a concert venue like this for a very long time.

1263
00:59:02,026 --> 00:59:03,125
I think it's the first time for me.

1264
00:59:03,126 --> 00:59:04,756
I've never been to a cello concert.

1265
00:59:05,267 --> 00:59:06,997
Do you often go to see a concert like this?

1266
00:59:07,667 --> 00:59:08,696
Sometimes.

1267
00:59:09,867 --> 00:59:11,766
I joined the classical music club at my company...

1268
00:59:11,767 --> 00:59:13,965
to cultivate my hobbies.

1269
00:59:13,966 --> 00:59:16,376
So I watch classical music concerts sometimes with my friends there.

1270
00:59:16,637 --> 00:59:19,275
I just heard that she was a cellist,

1271
00:59:19,276 --> 00:59:21,546
and I heard she was famous later.

1272
00:59:21,946 --> 00:59:23,546
Actually, I have no idea.

1273
00:59:23,977 --> 00:59:26,917
I haven't seen her playing cello for a while.

1274
00:59:27,347 --> 00:59:29,816
I'm not usually excited about things like that,

1275
00:59:29,986 --> 00:59:31,287
but it made me very excited.

1276
00:59:39,897 --> 00:59:41,167
She looks good.

1277
00:59:45,807 --> 00:59:47,006
Yes. This is cool.

1278
01:00:28,307 --> 01:00:29,747
I don't know much about classical music.

1279
01:00:29,917 --> 01:00:32,187
So when she came out with a cello that was even bigger than her body,

1280
01:00:32,847 --> 01:00:35,486
I thought it was amazing and she looked cool.

1281
01:00:36,316 --> 01:00:38,355
She was completely different from how she looks at home.

1282
01:00:38,356 --> 01:00:40,687
She's like a cute Welsh Corgi at home.

1283
01:00:40,856 --> 01:00:43,796
But she looked so cool...

1284
01:00:44,097 --> 01:00:45,426
in a deity-like dress.

1285
01:01:07,946 --> 01:01:10,557
She's a very cheerful girl at home,

1286
01:01:10,617 --> 01:01:12,687
but I think I can't approach her anymore.

1287
01:01:13,287 --> 01:01:15,426
Even I fell in love although I'm a woman.

1288
01:01:16,296 --> 01:01:17,795
I can imagine how the guys might've felt.

1289
01:01:17,796 --> 01:01:20,396
Watching her seriously immersed in her work,

1290
01:01:20,397 --> 01:01:22,167
she looked even more amazing.

1291
01:01:22,736 --> 01:01:27,006
On the other hand, I envied her a little...

1292
01:01:27,537 --> 01:01:28,977
for living a life as a cellist.

1293
01:01:29,506 --> 01:01:30,536
She looked very happy.

1294
01:01:30,537 --> 01:01:33,105
"That's where her energy came from."

1295
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:35,347
"That's why she has a warm heart." That's what I felt.

1296
01:01:44,917 --> 01:01:46,126
Jae Hyung is a little sleepy.

1297
01:01:46,827 --> 01:01:47,855
Jae Hyung.

1298
01:01:47,856 --> 01:01:48,996
- Jae Hyung. - He looks sleepy.

1299
01:01:48,997 --> 01:01:50,625
- He yawned. - Jae Hyung.

1300
01:01:50,626 --> 01:01:51,626
- No. - Jae Hyung.

1301
01:01:51,627 --> 01:01:53,925
- He joined the club. - He said he had joined the club.

1302
01:01:53,926 --> 01:01:55,596
- He joined the club. - He does look sleepy.

1303
01:01:55,597 --> 01:01:58,066
He's a member of a classical music club, but he can feel sleepy.

1304
01:02:15,287 --> 01:02:16,316
It's over.

1305
01:02:20,656 --> 01:02:23,756
I felt a little nervous when I saw them.

1306
01:02:24,356 --> 01:02:25,525
I had butterflies in my stomach.

1307
01:02:25,526 --> 01:02:27,596
I was very grateful to them for watching my concert.

1308
01:02:27,597 --> 01:02:29,437
It felt different.

1309
01:02:30,066 --> 01:02:31,597
Gosh, it's a bouquet.

1310
01:02:32,307 --> 01:02:34,867
- Thank you. - Congratulations.

1311
01:02:39,977 --> 01:02:43,315
Yun Jae even gave me flowers.

1312
01:02:43,316 --> 01:02:47,216
I was so thankful.

1313
01:02:47,417 --> 01:02:48,816
The flowers were beautiful.

1314
01:02:49,656 --> 01:02:51,787
(Have you ever gave someone flowers as a gift recently?)

1315
01:02:51,957 --> 01:02:54,625
The last time was when I was in my mid-20s,

1316
01:02:54,626 --> 01:02:56,227
as far as I remember.

1317
01:02:56,526 --> 01:03:00,696
I'm having a lot of new experiences.

1318
01:03:01,227 --> 01:03:04,196
I was annoyed when I saw him all day,

1319
01:03:04,397 --> 01:03:07,806
but for that specific moment,

1320
01:03:07,807 --> 01:03:09,606
I was captivated by Yun Ha's charm.

1321
01:03:09,906 --> 01:03:12,847
So I wished that things work out for them.

1322
01:03:12,946 --> 01:03:14,176
I thought it was a good choice to buy flowers for her.

1323
01:03:15,676 --> 01:03:17,946
(They went out on a date after the concert.)

1324
01:03:19,387 --> 01:03:22,485
He has that younger guy vibe.

1325
01:03:22,486 --> 01:03:24,887
- You think so? - He...

1326
01:03:25,216 --> 01:03:28,456
Wearing a blue coat,

1327
01:03:28,457 --> 01:03:30,256
he looks...

1328
01:03:30,526 --> 01:03:32,126
like the Little Prince.

1329
01:03:32,727 --> 01:03:33,766
- You're right. - The Little Prince?

1330
01:03:33,767 --> 01:03:35,195
- The Little Prince? You're right. - Yes.

1331
01:03:35,196 --> 01:03:36,696
- Because of the blue coat. - By Saint-Exupery.

1332
01:03:37,397 --> 01:03:39,406
(Two days ago)

1333
01:03:39,867 --> 01:03:42,176
(They were determined to interfere with their siblings' love...)

1334
01:03:42,637 --> 01:03:45,306
(and their younger siblings sacrificed to give them a chance.)

1335
01:03:45,307 --> 01:03:47,976
(Your sibling gave you a chance to go on a date.)

1336
01:03:47,977 --> 01:03:49,916
(How selfish of him.)

1337
01:03:49,917 --> 01:03:51,916
(The couple to go out on a date has been finalized through...)

1338
01:03:51,917 --> 01:03:53,516
(the choice you made today over the phone.)

1339
01:03:53,517 --> 01:03:54,916
(Lee Yun Ha, Kim Yun Jae)

1340
01:03:54,917 --> 01:03:55,917
(So then only one...)

1341
01:03:55,918 --> 01:03:57,117
(Only one team made it?)

1342
01:03:57,557 --> 01:03:59,986
(Only the two most desperate people could go on a date.)

1343
01:04:02,426 --> 01:04:04,456
- I'm hungry. Aren't you hungry? - Yes.

1344
01:04:04,457 --> 01:04:05,827
I'm starving.

1345
01:04:07,397 --> 01:04:10,867
(Yun Ha and Yun Jae in a restaurant in Seocho-gu)

1346
01:04:15,406 --> 01:04:17,105
Let's have a drink as the concert is over.

1347
01:04:17,106 --> 01:04:18,137
We should.

1348
01:04:19,207 --> 01:04:20,506
- It's an after-party. - An after-party?

1349
01:04:20,606 --> 01:04:22,446
- Do you usually have after-parties? - We do.

1350
01:04:23,117 --> 01:04:24,576
- When we're close. - When you're close?

1351
01:04:24,577 --> 01:04:26,117
- We don't when we're not close. - You don't when you're not close.

1352
01:04:27,687 --> 01:04:28,956
I don't do it with today's performers.

1353
01:04:28,957 --> 01:04:30,057
You don't do it with today's performers.

1354
01:04:30,557 --> 01:04:32,187
- That's why they just left. - Yes.

1355
01:04:33,526 --> 01:04:35,155
I thought I wouldn't be nervous.

1356
01:04:35,156 --> 01:04:37,556
Was it because I watched her concert? I got nervous again.

1357
01:04:37,557 --> 01:04:40,866
She looked so beautiful.

1358
01:04:40,867 --> 01:04:42,236
It made me nervous again.

1359
01:04:42,997 --> 01:04:45,937
You were really cool.

1360
01:04:46,167 --> 01:04:48,707
I did? Thank you.

1361
01:04:52,376 --> 01:04:54,247
It felt like I was watching a beautiful music teacher.

1362
01:04:56,017 --> 01:04:57,417
- A cello teacher? - Yes.

1363
01:04:59,486 --> 01:05:01,946
I still have the sense of the cello in my hands.

1364
01:05:03,356 --> 01:05:04,456
Doesn't it hurt when you touch the strings?

1365
01:05:04,457 --> 01:05:05,787
- Not anymore. - Not anymore?

1366
01:05:06,057 --> 01:05:07,755
- Because of calluses? - Yes. Because of calluses.

1367
01:05:07,756 --> 01:05:09,456
I don't have many now.

1368
01:05:09,457 --> 01:05:10,497
I have one here.

1369
01:05:11,696 --> 01:05:13,866
And here.

1370
01:05:13,867 --> 01:05:16,236
(A flirtatious act callused hands)

1371
01:05:17,267 --> 01:05:18,667
It was...

1372
01:05:22,807 --> 01:05:24,906
It gave me butterflies at that moment.

1373
01:05:26,506 --> 01:05:29,077
- Let's eat. - Let's eat.

1374
01:05:29,617 --> 01:05:31,577
(Shaking)

1375
01:05:33,387 --> 01:05:35,457
I think you're less nervous than the last time.

1376
01:05:36,057 --> 01:05:37,387
If I'm more nervous than the last time,

1377
01:05:37,887 --> 01:05:40,227
- that's a problem. - That's true.

1378
01:05:44,526 --> 01:05:45,597
(He couldn't eat it.)

1379
01:05:47,426 --> 01:05:48,525
I know what it is.

1380
01:05:48,526 --> 01:05:49,835
- He didn't aim it properly. - Right.

1381
01:05:49,836 --> 01:05:51,097
This is what he did.

1382
01:05:52,966 --> 01:05:56,506
He was so nervous that he couldn't even find where his mouth was.

1383
01:05:57,937 --> 01:05:59,105
Who would put a spoon...

1384
01:05:59,106 --> 01:06:01,605
on your face...

1385
01:06:01,606 --> 01:06:03,016
while eating?

1386
01:06:03,017 --> 01:06:04,275
It never happens.

1387
01:06:04,276 --> 01:06:06,686
He was so nervous and distracted...

1388
01:06:06,687 --> 01:06:08,417
that he couldn't even find where his mouth was.

1389
01:06:09,687 --> 01:06:10,786
How can it happen?

1390
01:06:10,787 --> 01:06:12,356
Everyone has done it, right?

1391
01:06:14,086 --> 01:06:15,086
(He couldn't eat it.)

1392
01:06:19,196 --> 01:06:21,367
- The more I see you, - Yes.

1393
01:06:22,566 --> 01:06:23,897
I realize that you look a lot younger than your age.

1394
01:06:28,506 --> 01:06:30,776
- Thank you. - I can't get used to it.

1395
01:06:31,037 --> 01:06:32,136
Are you okay with dating a younger guy?

1396
01:06:32,137 --> 01:06:33,207
Have you dated a younger guy?

1397
01:06:33,477 --> 01:06:34,605
Most of them were younger than me.

1398
01:06:34,606 --> 01:06:35,716
I see.

1399
01:06:36,316 --> 01:06:38,815
Jung Sub dated many older women.

1400
01:06:38,816 --> 01:06:40,216
And I dated many younger men.

1401
01:06:40,716 --> 01:06:42,356
I think that's how it is for us.

1402
01:06:44,856 --> 01:06:46,057
I've never dated an older woman.

1403
01:06:46,256 --> 01:06:47,356
- Really? - Yes.

1404
01:06:47,756 --> 01:06:48,827
All the people I dated were younger or the same age as me.

1405
01:06:49,126 --> 01:06:51,356
- You dated people around your age. - Yes.

1406
01:06:52,796 --> 01:06:54,066
When are you going to speak casually to me?

1407
01:06:56,497 --> 01:06:57,836
- Yun Jae. - Hold on.

1408
01:06:57,997 --> 01:06:59,006
- I'm sure... - Dropping honorifics?

1409
01:06:59,466 --> 01:07:00,766
I've never dated an older woman.

1410
01:07:00,767 --> 01:07:01,767
- Really? - Yes.

1411
01:07:02,207 --> 01:07:03,437
All the people I dated were younger or the same age as me.

1412
01:07:03,676 --> 01:07:06,006
- You dated people around your age. - Yes.

1413
01:07:07,406 --> 01:07:08,807
When are you going to speak casually to me?

1414
01:07:11,117 --> 01:07:12,287
- Yun Jae. - Hold on.

1415
01:07:12,546 --> 01:07:14,315
- I'm sure... - Dropping honorifics?

1416
01:07:14,316 --> 01:07:15,916
- someone coached him. - What was that?

1417
01:07:15,917 --> 01:07:17,985
- Did he have a private lesson? - He had a private lesson.

1418
01:07:17,986 --> 01:07:20,125
Otherwise, he can't improve so much like this.

1419
01:07:20,126 --> 01:07:21,686
I think he was possessed by a ghost or something.

1420
01:07:21,687 --> 01:07:23,655
- He was suddenly possessed. - Oh, my gosh.

1421
01:07:23,656 --> 01:07:24,795
- He became a different person. - He's a different person.

1422
01:07:24,796 --> 01:07:26,465
- That's what I'm saying. - "When are you going to speak..."

1423
01:07:26,466 --> 01:07:28,396
He bought flowers today,

1424
01:07:28,397 --> 01:07:29,996
so he thought he should pluck up his courage.

1425
01:07:29,997 --> 01:07:31,166
- He was determined. - He was determined.

1426
01:07:31,167 --> 01:07:32,235
He awakened.

1427
01:07:32,236 --> 01:07:33,965
Yes. I can tell by his outfit too.

1428
01:07:33,966 --> 01:07:35,136
- Like the Little Prince. - Even his outfit.

1429
01:07:35,137 --> 01:07:36,137
Yes.

1430
01:07:36,138 --> 01:07:37,206
- It shows his courage. - Right.

1431
01:07:37,207 --> 01:07:38,706
He's wearing the Little Prince coat.

1432
01:07:38,707 --> 01:07:39,747
(He's like the Little Prince.)

1433
01:07:40,347 --> 01:07:41,776
When are you going to speak casually to me?

1434
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:43,747
- Should I speak casually? - Yes.

1435
01:07:46,647 --> 01:07:49,457
(Does Yun Jae not like that he's younger than you?)

1436
01:07:49,617 --> 01:07:52,286
He didn't dislike it at all. He was very confident.

1437
01:07:52,287 --> 01:07:55,557
That's what made him more attractive.

1438
01:07:56,296 --> 01:07:59,496
When I learned about her age, I was just surprised.

1439
01:07:59,497 --> 01:08:01,167
I didn't have any particular thoughts.

1440
01:08:01,367 --> 01:08:03,236
Ever since I became 30,

1441
01:08:03,566 --> 01:08:05,237
an age difference has never bothered me.

1442
01:08:05,607 --> 01:08:08,067
You were surprised when my age was revealed, right?

1443
01:08:08,866 --> 01:08:10,876
- It got me surprised. - Right?

1444
01:08:11,576 --> 01:08:12,746
Because you didn't look like it.

1445
01:08:14,676 --> 01:08:16,816
I'm glad I don't look like it at least.

1446
01:08:16,817 --> 01:08:20,216
Yes. I think your age would be the most unexpected.

1447
01:08:20,487 --> 01:08:22,955
Even Ji Won was surprised. I saw it.

1448
01:08:22,956 --> 01:08:24,585
- I saw her face. - Did you see her face?

1449
01:08:24,586 --> 01:08:26,456
She's usually good at keeping a poker face.

1450
01:08:27,126 --> 01:08:28,727
If you could tell how she felt...

1451
01:08:29,557 --> 01:08:31,227
You should go to the community service center.

1452
01:08:31,657 --> 01:08:34,267
Your parents may have registered your birth too early.

1453
01:08:35,426 --> 01:08:36,597
You should visit there.

1454
01:08:36,937 --> 01:08:39,836
I want to register my birth again.

1455
01:08:41,567 --> 01:08:43,176
You're pretty and attractive. That's all that matters.

1456
01:08:43,506 --> 01:08:44,976
- What? Is he really possessed? - "You're pretty and attractive."

1457
01:08:44,977 --> 01:08:46,006
- Goodness. - "That's all that matters."

1458
01:08:46,107 --> 01:08:47,175
Oh, my.

1459
01:08:47,176 --> 01:08:48,277
- What's going on? - My gosh.

1460
01:08:48,477 --> 01:08:49,616
He did it again.

1461
01:08:49,817 --> 01:08:51,346
I thought it'd be just once, but he did it again.

1462
01:08:51,347 --> 01:08:54,017
- He's like a machine pistol. - I know.

1463
01:08:54,116 --> 01:08:56,916
This is unbelievable.

1464
01:08:58,987 --> 01:09:00,027
She likes it.

1465
01:09:01,626 --> 01:09:03,027
You're pretty and attractive. That's all that matters.

1466
01:09:04,557 --> 01:09:05,597
Thank you.

1467
01:09:07,097 --> 01:09:08,796
"You're pretty and attractive."

1468
01:09:11,437 --> 01:09:13,836
He compliments me a lot...

1469
01:09:14,006 --> 01:09:16,107
at the most unexpected moment.

1470
01:09:16,237 --> 01:09:19,376
I don't know what to do.

1471
01:09:20,076 --> 01:09:21,906
It must be fun to get on an airplane together.

1472
01:09:21,907 --> 01:09:22,947
Yes.

1473
01:09:22,977 --> 01:09:23,977
It's going to be so fun.

1474
01:09:24,777 --> 01:09:27,387
(Do you want to go on a date with other people in Singapore?)

1475
01:09:27,517 --> 01:09:29,956
Not really. I don't want to do that at all.

1476
01:09:30,157 --> 01:09:31,886
To be honest, we're only there for a very short time.

1477
01:09:31,887 --> 01:09:34,326
So I plan on only focusing on Yun Ha.

1478
01:09:34,826 --> 01:09:36,197
Why do you have such long legs?

1479
01:09:37,397 --> 01:09:38,795
Everyone here has long legs.

1480
01:09:38,796 --> 01:09:41,826
Your legs are so long that I'm startled every time I see them.

1481
01:09:42,466 --> 01:09:44,166
If I was a woman, I'd have a crush on Yong Woo.

1482
01:09:44,267 --> 01:09:45,666
He must have been popular back in the day.

1483
01:09:45,966 --> 01:09:47,836
- You must have been popular too. - No.

1484
01:09:49,176 --> 01:09:51,006
I was not for sure.

1485
01:09:51,376 --> 01:09:52,477
Ji Won was popular.

1486
01:09:52,576 --> 01:09:54,647
She seems like it. She's pretty.

1487
01:09:57,147 --> 01:09:58,216
I'm relieved we ate everything.

1488
01:10:00,546 --> 01:10:03,156
She's like a cat. Doesn't she look like a cat?

1489
01:10:03,157 --> 01:10:04,657
What kind of cat is that vicious?

1490
01:10:06,387 --> 01:10:08,456
So I wanted to be friends with her from the beginning.

1491
01:10:08,887 --> 01:10:10,727
Then the two of you should have drinks on the plane.

1492
01:10:10,996 --> 01:10:11,996
We will.

1493
01:10:12,496 --> 01:10:13,767
- Do you want to join? - Sure.

1494
01:10:17,036 --> 01:10:18,036
Should we go?

1495
01:10:18,767 --> 01:10:19,767
Let's go.

1496
01:10:20,767 --> 01:10:22,737
(The house in Seorae Village)

1497
01:10:23,407 --> 01:10:25,777
(They've returned to the house after watching the show.)

1498
01:10:26,607 --> 01:10:28,447
The flowers look prettier.

1499
01:10:30,017 --> 01:10:32,176
- What? - The flowers look prettier.

1500
01:10:32,517 --> 01:10:35,486
- Really? Within a day? - I think they've blossomed more.

1501
01:10:35,487 --> 01:10:38,116
- Are they getting prettier? - Yes.

1502
01:10:39,487 --> 01:10:41,755
(The others have arrived soon after.)

1503
01:10:41,756 --> 01:10:42,826
I'm cold.

1504
01:10:43,027 --> 01:10:44,656
- I'm so hungry. - I'm hungry.

1505
01:10:44,657 --> 01:10:46,366
- Right. - I'll grill some meat for you.

1506
01:10:46,666 --> 01:10:47,666
There should be meat.

1507
01:10:47,767 --> 01:10:49,436
The two of you look so good together.

1508
01:10:49,437 --> 01:10:51,396
- You two look good together too. - What? When did you take this?

1509
01:10:51,397 --> 01:10:52,936
Yesterday. And...

1510
01:10:52,937 --> 01:10:54,535
My clothes look like we're on the same team.

1511
01:10:54,536 --> 01:10:55,606
You should have taken this with me too.

1512
01:10:55,607 --> 01:10:56,636
Right.

1513
01:10:56,637 --> 01:10:58,907
(He shows her pictures he took.)

1514
01:10:59,307 --> 01:11:02,307
I can't believe we're leaving this house.

1515
01:11:02,416 --> 01:11:04,916
I have mixed feelings.

1516
01:11:06,017 --> 01:11:09,616
As I watched our things getting packed away in the house in Seoul,

1517
01:11:09,716 --> 01:11:12,387
I really didn't want to leave.

1518
01:11:14,286 --> 01:11:16,295
(We're like a close-knit family.)

1519
01:11:16,296 --> 01:11:19,726
I feel like I've grown closer to my sister.

1520
01:11:19,727 --> 01:11:23,496
Our relationship returned a bit to how it used to be before.

1521
01:11:23,697 --> 01:11:26,736
To be honest, right before we left,

1522
01:11:26,737 --> 01:11:30,175
I became curious about someone.

1523
01:11:30,176 --> 01:11:34,447
So in that sense, I feel like this could be the beginning.

1524
01:11:38,416 --> 01:11:40,746
I'm glad we don't have to send messages today.

1525
01:11:40,847 --> 01:11:43,657
What do you think he would have done if we had to send messages?

1526
01:11:44,586 --> 01:11:46,456
I don't think he would have sent it to me.

1527
01:11:47,157 --> 01:11:49,357
- What about you? - I would have sent it to him.

1528
01:11:49,557 --> 01:11:50,996
- Really? - Yes.

1529
01:11:53,826 --> 01:11:56,737
You're so cool. How are you like that?

1530
01:11:59,536 --> 01:12:00,906
When I look at Ju Yeon,

1531
01:12:00,907 --> 01:12:03,307
I can see where her heart is at, as much as she can see mine.

1532
01:12:03,637 --> 01:12:05,876
This is the person her heart is leaning toward,

1533
01:12:06,176 --> 01:12:09,516
and she doesn't seem like the type who's feelings can easily change...

1534
01:12:09,517 --> 01:12:11,246
depending on that person's response.

1535
01:12:11,447 --> 01:12:14,085
It's very fun when I talk about my brother with Ju Yeon,

1536
01:12:14,086 --> 01:12:15,215
and I want to help her out.

1537
01:12:15,216 --> 01:12:18,556
And when I found out Ji Won suddenly had feelings for him,

1538
01:12:18,557 --> 01:12:20,987
I was happy, and I wanted to help her out too.

1539
01:12:21,626 --> 01:12:23,296
So I'm in a difficult position.

1540
01:12:26,897 --> 01:12:28,795
You must be very affectionate about her,

1541
01:12:28,796 --> 01:12:30,335
- with a nine-year age difference. - Right.

1542
01:12:30,336 --> 01:12:33,166
I've never been up close with other pairs of siblings around me...

1543
01:12:33,536 --> 01:12:36,206
because it's usually really not that easy to do.

1544
01:12:36,777 --> 01:12:39,036
But I realized here that we are a bit different.

1545
01:12:39,137 --> 01:12:42,476
I felt something while watching Yun Jae and Ji Won.

1546
01:12:42,477 --> 01:12:44,847
I was just like that three to four years ago.

1547
01:12:44,947 --> 01:12:47,687
So I spoke in a tougher manner,

1548
01:12:47,887 --> 01:12:49,616
and I didn't like hanging out with Cho A.

1549
01:12:49,916 --> 01:12:51,085
I preferred to hang out with my friends.

1550
01:12:51,086 --> 01:12:53,256
But around that time,

1551
01:12:53,357 --> 01:12:56,796
I felt a lot of gratitude toward Cho A.

1552
01:12:56,996 --> 01:12:58,926
So as time went on, my attitude changed.

1553
01:12:59,027 --> 01:13:02,836
So I feel like that made me express more with her.

1554
01:13:03,536 --> 01:13:05,566
And I think a lot about how, at the end of the day,

1555
01:13:05,567 --> 01:13:07,006
- all you have is family. - That's right.

1556
01:13:07,567 --> 01:13:11,237
The house in Seorae Village was a space full of warmth.

1557
01:13:11,506 --> 01:13:14,206
I used to think I was better off being alone,

1558
01:13:14,847 --> 01:13:17,347
but I realized I'd just been repressing these emotions.

1559
01:13:17,947 --> 01:13:20,646
I think being here really brought a lot of emotions...

1560
01:13:20,647 --> 01:13:22,147
back to life.

1561
01:13:22,246 --> 01:13:23,887
When I came here, I was so surprised...

1562
01:13:24,357 --> 01:13:26,887
because I'd personally never seen pairs of brothers,

1563
01:13:26,987 --> 01:13:28,256
pairs of sisters,

1564
01:13:28,357 --> 01:13:30,956
or pairs of a brother and a sister talk to each other nicely before.

1565
01:13:31,057 --> 01:13:32,896
Me neither.

1566
01:13:32,897 --> 01:13:34,567
But I got here and...

1567
01:13:35,067 --> 01:13:37,096
They especially spoke nicely to each other.

1568
01:13:37,097 --> 01:13:39,035
- Right. - And the two of you...

1569
01:13:39,036 --> 01:13:40,636
kept going to each other.

1570
01:13:40,637 --> 01:13:43,636
And on the first day, Jung Sub told Yun Ha...

1571
01:13:43,637 --> 01:13:45,036
that she was the prettiest one.

1572
01:13:45,706 --> 01:13:47,205
That was...

1573
01:13:47,206 --> 01:13:49,615
In my 31 years of life,

1574
01:13:49,616 --> 01:13:52,347
that was impossible.

1575
01:13:52,447 --> 01:13:54,716
I didn't have a lot of time to talk to Ji Won,

1576
01:13:55,017 --> 01:13:57,916
and to be honest, I didn't pay attention to her.

1577
01:13:58,357 --> 01:13:59,986
When we get to Singapore,

1578
01:13:59,987 --> 01:14:02,387
Ji Won can take a break from work.

1579
01:14:02,527 --> 01:14:04,496
I've also been curious about who she liked.

1580
01:14:04,756 --> 01:14:05,926
I should do my best to help her out.

1581
01:14:10,166 --> 01:14:13,407
(Yun Jae falls asleep after everyone else.)

1582
01:14:19,176 --> 01:14:21,546
(Early in the morning, on the day they leave for Singapore)

1583
01:14:22,676 --> 01:14:24,246
(Yawning)

1584
01:14:26,887 --> 01:14:28,187
(Yawning)

1585
01:14:30,916 --> 01:14:32,017
What time did you wake up?

1586
01:14:32,416 --> 01:14:34,187
- Ten minutes ago. - Same.

1587
01:14:38,357 --> 01:14:39,496
Can I have some water too?

1588
01:14:40,326 --> 01:14:41,326
I packed everything.

1589
01:14:45,437 --> 01:14:46,506
Let's take a picture.

1590
01:14:49,907 --> 01:14:53,075
It's my first time traveling somewhere alone...

1591
01:14:53,076 --> 01:14:55,347
with someone of the opposite gender.

1592
01:14:55,947 --> 01:14:59,786
The situation was very fun for me, to be honest.

1593
01:15:00,546 --> 01:15:02,956
"I hope we get to talk a lot for a long time."

1594
01:15:03,357 --> 01:15:05,585
The expectation and excitement actually...

1595
01:15:05,586 --> 01:15:08,626
kept me awake for most of the night.

1596
01:15:08,727 --> 01:15:09,727
You look cute.

1597
01:15:11,357 --> 01:15:12,995
I don't look cute, I'm just cute.

1598
01:15:12,996 --> 01:15:14,067
- You're just cute? - Yes.

1599
01:15:14,326 --> 01:15:15,796
You were cute from the get-go.

1600
01:15:15,897 --> 01:15:17,097
You were born cute.

1601
01:15:21,637 --> 01:15:23,777
- It's going to be very hot. - That sounds great.

1602
01:15:26,206 --> 01:15:29,245
- You like summer? - I love summer.

1603
01:15:29,246 --> 01:15:30,716
- You prefer summer. - Yes.

1604
01:15:31,517 --> 01:15:33,116
No wonder you're such a warm person.

1605
01:15:35,116 --> 01:15:38,116
You're full of summer's warmth.

1606
01:15:39,727 --> 01:15:41,286
I should use you as my hand warmer sometime.

1607
01:15:43,357 --> 01:15:44,357
When I'm cold.

1608
01:15:45,496 --> 01:15:49,196
I was feeling some tension...

1609
01:15:49,197 --> 01:15:51,137
and excitement too.

1610
01:15:51,697 --> 01:15:54,106
I was going on a trip with someone I had feelings for,

1611
01:15:54,107 --> 01:15:56,006
just the two of us.

1612
01:15:56,336 --> 01:15:58,536
So I felt some tension from that.

1613
01:15:58,876 --> 01:16:00,476
Cho A's very busy with work...

1614
01:16:00,477 --> 01:16:02,307
and her daily schedule doesn't align with mine,

1615
01:16:02,777 --> 01:16:06,086
so I've been waiting for a moment like this.

1616
01:16:06,716 --> 01:16:08,516
We actually took a lot of pictures together.

1617
01:16:08,517 --> 01:16:10,316
- Right. - I'm glad.

1618
01:16:10,317 --> 01:16:13,556
(Yong Woo and Cho A have been given precious time together.)

1619
01:16:13,557 --> 01:16:14,586
With the desert foxes.

1620
01:16:17,326 --> 01:16:18,996
It's going to be fun. I hope it's not too hot.

1621
01:16:19,397 --> 01:16:22,097
I think it's the humidity that's going to be the problem.

1622
01:16:22,897 --> 01:16:25,036
- Can I call you casually? - Yes.

1623
01:16:25,897 --> 01:16:28,236
I'm okay with speaking both casually and respectfully,

1624
01:16:28,237 --> 01:16:29,977
but I'm not good at calling others casually.

1625
01:16:31,036 --> 01:16:32,705
I kept referring to you respectfully as Jae Hyung.

1626
01:16:32,706 --> 01:16:33,706
Right.

1627
01:16:34,607 --> 01:16:37,147
(Those who haven't been chosen get in the car too.)

1628
01:16:37,777 --> 01:16:40,387
(They put on their seat belts first.)

1629
01:16:40,616 --> 01:16:42,546
Where's the seat belt?

1630
01:16:43,786 --> 01:16:44,817
Wait.

1631
01:16:44,916 --> 01:16:46,426
That's mine.

1632
01:16:48,926 --> 01:16:50,425
No, that's mine.

1633
01:16:50,426 --> 01:16:52,397
There was nothing here. Here it is.

1634
01:16:53,366 --> 01:16:56,137
I was like, "Where is it?" But he took it from behind me.

1635
01:16:56,836 --> 01:16:58,097
Did you drink a lot last night?

1636
01:16:58,296 --> 01:17:00,136
No, I only had one drink before going to bed.

1637
01:17:00,137 --> 01:17:01,937
That one drink must have been a huge one.

1638
01:17:02,137 --> 01:17:04,705
- Right. - Right?

1639
01:17:04,706 --> 01:17:05,937
(They're full of laughter early in the morning.)

1640
01:17:06,176 --> 01:17:09,875
I became a team with Cheol Hyeon, Yun Jae, and Ji Won,

1641
01:17:09,876 --> 01:17:11,147
and we all got in the same car.

1642
01:17:11,477 --> 01:17:13,816
I was a bit jealous that the others got to spend...

1643
01:17:13,817 --> 01:17:15,416
alone time with each other.

1644
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:18,455
But we could fall asleep during our ride there,

1645
01:17:18,456 --> 01:17:21,687
and if it was just the two of us, I could have shown my ugly side.

1646
01:17:21,887 --> 01:17:23,755
So I was all right with this in that...

1647
01:17:23,756 --> 01:17:25,657
we could travel comfortably.

1648
01:17:27,926 --> 01:17:29,365
(They arrived at the airport.)

1649
01:17:29,366 --> 01:17:30,496
Your bag looks nice.

1650
01:17:30,836 --> 01:17:32,036
- You like it? - Yes.

1651
01:17:32,737 --> 01:17:34,566
(Ju Yeon and Jae Hyung are getting coffee.)

1652
01:17:34,567 --> 01:17:35,807
- It's Yong Woo. - Gosh.

1653
01:17:36,376 --> 01:17:37,636
Did they just hold hands?

1654
01:17:37,637 --> 01:17:39,036
- I also thought... - Right?

1655
01:17:39,477 --> 01:17:40,746
- I saw them. - Really?

1656
01:17:40,847 --> 01:17:41,875
I saw them.

1657
01:17:41,876 --> 01:17:43,777
They're like a married couple.

1658
01:17:46,687 --> 01:17:47,915
(Slightly leaning)

1659
01:17:47,916 --> 01:17:48,987
You're a bit...

1660
01:17:50,657 --> 01:17:52,016
Yong Woo and Cho A were...

1661
01:17:52,017 --> 01:17:56,626
It wasn't just me, but other people thought they were going strong...

1662
01:17:56,857 --> 01:17:59,256
and that they seemed like newlyweds on their honeymoon too.

1663
01:18:00,296 --> 01:18:01,296
We're here.

1664
01:18:01,826 --> 01:18:03,666
You can put that down if it's heavy for you.

1665
01:18:03,866 --> 01:18:04,896
- This? - Yes.

1666
01:18:04,897 --> 01:18:05,937
I think it's okay for you to take a break.

1667
01:18:06,706 --> 01:18:08,106
The others over there...

1668
01:18:08,107 --> 01:18:10,036
(Happily watching them)

1669
01:18:10,506 --> 01:18:12,107
Were they really holding hands though?

1670
01:18:12,506 --> 01:18:13,705
Maybe they were just overlapping each other.

1671
01:18:13,706 --> 01:18:16,516
I saw them let go of each other in a hurry.

1672
01:18:16,517 --> 01:18:18,416
(She's spreading rumors.)

1673
01:18:19,786 --> 01:18:21,816
Are they seeing each other with marriage in mind?

1674
01:18:21,817 --> 01:18:22,886
(Are they seeing each other with marriage in mind?)

1675
01:18:22,887 --> 01:18:24,987
I mean, it's time.

1676
01:18:25,157 --> 01:18:29,056
Is Cho A the type Yong Woo usually goes for?

1677
01:18:29,057 --> 01:18:30,097
Totally.

1678
01:18:30,426 --> 01:18:31,856
- Really? - That's why I chose...

1679
01:18:31,857 --> 01:18:32,857
Cho A in the beginning.

1680
01:18:33,326 --> 01:18:35,066
I think you're right.

1681
01:18:35,067 --> 01:18:36,767
Because when I asked Yong Woo what his ideal type was,

1682
01:18:36,966 --> 01:18:40,505
he said he likes sophisticated, elegant women...

1683
01:18:40,506 --> 01:18:44,335
and that he's mostly been with women who were older than him.

1684
01:18:44,336 --> 01:18:47,977
It felt like he had Cho A in mind when he said that.

1685
01:18:48,676 --> 01:18:51,647
They kept saying we seemed like newlyweds,

1686
01:18:52,416 --> 01:18:54,017
as if they didn't themselves.

1687
01:18:55,647 --> 01:18:56,916
But I feel like,

1688
01:18:57,317 --> 01:19:01,326
compared to the two short dates we went on before,

1689
01:19:01,727 --> 01:19:04,227
the situation was more exciting and fun.

1690
01:19:04,626 --> 01:19:08,625
I guess that's why they thought we seemed like newlyweds.

1691
01:19:08,626 --> 01:19:10,996
(Did you hold hands?)

1692
01:19:11,097 --> 01:19:14,437
I don't remember holding hands.

1693
01:19:14,767 --> 01:19:15,807
At the airport?

1694
01:19:16,737 --> 01:19:18,777
We didn't hold hands at the airport.

1695
01:19:19,107 --> 01:19:22,375
He did hold my hand...

1696
01:19:22,376 --> 01:19:24,616
when I was getting out of the car.

1697
01:19:28,947 --> 01:19:30,057
You must have been hungry.

1698
01:19:33,487 --> 01:19:34,727
I didn't realize it,

1699
01:19:36,527 --> 01:19:37,697
but I was very hungry.

1700
01:19:44,697 --> 01:19:46,606
Gosh, they're basically dating.

1701
01:19:46,607 --> 01:19:48,767
- Right. They're it. - They're together at this point.

1702
01:19:49,036 --> 01:19:50,576
They look so good together.

1703
01:19:50,876 --> 01:19:52,307
Cho A, where are you going today?

1704
01:19:52,836 --> 01:19:55,347
I'm going to Singapore with Yong Woo...

1705
01:19:56,107 --> 01:19:57,416
for our date.

1706
01:19:57,647 --> 01:19:58,876
Where are we right now?

1707
01:19:59,076 --> 01:20:00,546
We're at Incheon International Airport.

1708
01:20:01,086 --> 01:20:03,057
I barely got any sleep.

1709
01:20:03,187 --> 01:20:04,187
Really?

1710
01:20:04,188 --> 01:20:06,526
Were you too excited to sleep?

1711
01:20:06,527 --> 01:20:08,256
I was definitely excited.

1712
01:20:08,987 --> 01:20:10,157
Why were you excited?

1713
01:20:10,527 --> 01:20:11,556
- About today? - Yes.

1714
01:20:11,557 --> 01:20:12,657
(Today? Let's see.)

1715
01:20:13,126 --> 01:20:16,336
Going on a date overseas...

1716
01:20:16,866 --> 01:20:18,136
is something I've never done before.

1717
01:20:18,137 --> 01:20:19,766
Me too.

1718
01:20:19,767 --> 01:20:22,836
So, for various reasons, I spent last night...

1719
01:20:23,737 --> 01:20:25,036
full of excitement.

1720
01:20:26,107 --> 01:20:27,347
We'll do this and...

1721
01:20:27,706 --> 01:20:29,176
- Let's share. - Sure.

1722
01:20:32,116 --> 01:20:34,116
Hold this with your mouth for a second. Just a moment.

1723
01:20:36,857 --> 01:20:37,916
All right. Here.

1724
01:20:38,657 --> 01:20:39,657
Okay.

1725
01:20:39,658 --> 01:20:40,956
(Delicious)

1726
01:20:43,657 --> 01:20:46,626
I feel like this angle makes me look foolish and weird.

1727
01:20:49,767 --> 01:20:51,897
(Ju Yeon has donut crumbs on her lips.)

1728
01:20:52,697 --> 01:20:55,266
Ju Yeon, I feel like you should wipe your mouth.

1729
01:20:55,267 --> 01:20:56,267
Do it for me.

1730
01:20:56,676 --> 01:20:57,836
- Do it for you? - Yes.

1731
01:21:02,407 --> 01:21:03,575
She's so forward.

1732
01:21:03,576 --> 01:21:05,776
- She's forward. - Ju Yeon is charming...

1733
01:21:05,777 --> 01:21:06,785
She is.

1734
01:21:06,786 --> 01:21:08,245
- She's charming like that. - She's full of charm.

1735
01:21:08,246 --> 01:21:09,286
"Do it for me."

1736
01:21:09,416 --> 01:21:10,416
That's amazing.

1737
01:21:10,417 --> 01:21:11,585
- That's not easy to do. - It's usually hard to do that...

1738
01:21:11,586 --> 01:21:12,586
in front of someone you really like.

1739
01:21:12,586 --> 01:21:13,586
Right.

1740
01:21:15,086 --> 01:21:16,157
- Interesting. - Gosh.

1741
01:21:16,897 --> 01:21:19,425
Ju Yeon, I feel like you should wipe your mouth.

1742
01:21:19,426 --> 01:21:20,426
Do it for me.

1743
01:21:20,866 --> 01:21:22,027
- Do it for you? - Yes.

1744
01:21:24,097 --> 01:21:26,666
I feel like, if I do it...

1745
01:21:27,737 --> 01:21:29,466
- You won't do it right? Okay. - No.

1746
01:21:30,737 --> 01:21:34,376
I feel like I might wipe your lips too roughly.

1747
01:21:34,576 --> 01:21:36,447
Let me see. You got it.

1748
01:21:37,116 --> 01:21:38,777
All done.

1749
01:21:39,517 --> 01:21:41,085
After taking time to get ready,

1750
01:21:41,086 --> 01:21:42,586
she is a ready quokka.

1751
01:21:42,817 --> 01:21:43,857
Hello.

1752
01:21:45,057 --> 01:21:46,317
I wonder where Se Seung is.

1753
01:21:47,357 --> 01:21:48,926
So we have to go over there again?

1754
01:21:49,996 --> 01:21:52,197
- It's heavy, isn't it? - It's really not.

1755
01:21:59,397 --> 01:22:00,437
Let's take our time.

1756
01:22:01,567 --> 01:22:03,436
We were wearing matching outfits...

1757
01:22:03,437 --> 01:22:04,977
and talking as we walked.

1758
01:22:05,206 --> 01:22:07,045
It felt like we were a couple.

1759
01:22:07,046 --> 01:22:10,376
I was very excited to go...

1760
01:22:11,447 --> 01:22:14,647
with the person I had feelings for, while being lovey-dovey.

1761
01:22:16,347 --> 01:22:17,786
We're headed to Singapore.

1762
01:22:18,256 --> 01:22:20,786
Let's go to Singapore.

1763
01:22:31,737 --> 01:22:35,436
(Yun Jae's camera)

1764
01:22:35,437 --> 01:22:36,477
The view is nice.

1765
01:22:39,737 --> 01:22:41,307
I want to get to the lodge and take a shower.

1766
01:22:42,407 --> 01:22:44,647
I feel too lazy to film myself, so I'm going to film you guys.

1767
01:22:46,277 --> 01:22:47,546
How long were you asleep?

1768
01:22:48,046 --> 01:22:49,487
About six hours.

1769
01:22:50,716 --> 01:22:52,416
Did you eat in between?

1770
01:22:52,586 --> 01:22:55,027
Yes. We had octopus fried rice.

1771
01:23:06,137 --> 01:23:07,606
Your favorite songs.

1772
01:23:07,607 --> 01:23:09,567
What else is there besides songs by Seo Young Eun?

1773
01:23:10,076 --> 01:23:11,375
I like "Hype Boy."

1774
01:23:11,376 --> 01:23:12,476
- "Hype Boy?" - Yes.

1775
01:23:12,477 --> 01:23:15,477
You danced to that song.

1776
01:23:15,807 --> 01:23:17,347
It's you I like.

1777
01:23:20,487 --> 01:23:22,285
Since they both know how they feel,

1778
01:23:22,286 --> 01:23:23,615
Cho A's a lot more expressive.

1779
01:23:23,616 --> 01:23:25,116
- Right. - Yes, she's completely different.

1780
01:23:25,956 --> 01:23:27,387
It's you I like.

1781
01:23:30,296 --> 01:23:31,557
I just had a heart attack.

1782
01:23:32,857 --> 01:23:35,197
It's nice being in a different country.

1783
01:23:35,697 --> 01:23:36,697
It's nice.

1784
01:23:37,197 --> 01:23:39,067
I'm looking forward to our lodge.

1785
01:23:39,366 --> 01:23:41,036
I'm totally looking forward to it.

1786
01:23:43,307 --> 01:23:44,836
I'm exhausted.

1787
01:23:45,407 --> 01:23:47,347
(Silence)

1788
01:23:48,807 --> 01:23:49,947
Say something.

1789
01:23:51,017 --> 01:23:52,546
Why do you have your mouth shut?

1790
01:23:53,017 --> 01:23:55,246
- I have nothing to say. - Open your mouth.

1791
01:23:56,046 --> 01:23:57,956
Why do you have the camera so close?

1792
01:23:58,086 --> 01:24:00,085
- Open your mouth. - Hold it up properly.

1793
01:24:00,086 --> 01:24:01,156
Everyone else is holding it up properly.

1794
01:24:01,157 --> 01:24:02,356
I don't know how.

1795
01:24:02,357 --> 01:24:03,526
Hold it up like that.

1796
01:24:03,527 --> 01:24:05,256
I'm doing the same thing.

1797
01:24:07,166 --> 01:24:09,425
Let's put this on before we go outside...

1798
01:24:09,426 --> 01:24:10,737
as it gets humid.

1799
01:24:11,836 --> 01:24:14,506
(He puts pain relief patch for Se Seung where she got hurt.)

1800
01:24:15,237 --> 01:24:16,506
Does it still hurt? How does it feel?

1801
01:24:16,876 --> 01:24:18,505
- It hurts when I touch it, - Yes.

1802
01:24:18,506 --> 01:24:20,705
but it feels fine when I'm just walking around.

1803
01:24:20,706 --> 01:24:21,706
All right.

1804
01:24:22,006 --> 01:24:23,647
- It's totally fine. - Okay.

1805
01:24:24,576 --> 01:24:25,916
Thank you.

1806
01:24:27,046 --> 01:24:28,186
He took great care of me...

1807
01:24:28,187 --> 01:24:29,817
like he was my dad.

1808
01:24:30,216 --> 01:24:32,256
That was really moving.

1809
01:24:32,887 --> 01:24:34,026
I feel like it's going to be fun.

1810
01:24:34,027 --> 01:24:35,626
- The weather is... - Gosh.

1811
01:24:36,256 --> 01:24:38,227
- It's not hot at all. - It's not hot.

1812
01:24:55,107 --> 01:24:58,847
We've arrived in Singapore.

1813
01:25:01,487 --> 01:25:02,616
We're in Singapore.

1814
01:25:03,187 --> 01:25:04,856
- Hello. - Hello. How are you?

1815
01:25:04,857 --> 01:25:06,115
I'm good. You?

1816
01:25:06,116 --> 01:25:07,387
- Good. - Thank you.

1817
01:25:14,166 --> 01:25:15,666
That's Marina Bay Sands.

1818
01:25:18,466 --> 01:25:20,437
- Those three towers look like... - Yes.

1819
01:25:20,836 --> 01:25:22,665
they're holding up that ship on top.

1820
01:25:22,666 --> 01:25:23,706
I see.

1821
01:25:33,116 --> 01:25:34,545
(High-rise buildings...)

1822
01:25:34,546 --> 01:25:37,086
(and greenery are in harmony together.)

1823
01:25:40,727 --> 01:25:43,527
(What's going to happen here?)

1824
01:26:20,166 --> 01:26:21,397
Gosh, it's so beautiful.

1825
01:26:21,626 --> 01:26:23,437
It really is beautiful.

1826
01:26:26,267 --> 01:26:27,907
I feel happier and happier.

1827
01:26:34,477 --> 01:26:37,546
(Cho A and Yong Woo at Brewerkz)

1828
01:26:39,347 --> 01:26:40,916
We have a view of Marina Bay Sands.

1829
01:26:41,116 --> 01:26:42,146
- We do. - Yes.

1830
01:26:42,147 --> 01:26:43,346
(At this craft brewery with a patio...)

1831
01:26:43,347 --> 01:26:46,216
(where they have a view of Marina Bay Sands,)

1832
01:26:47,057 --> 01:26:48,526
(They have their first meal.)

1833
01:26:48,527 --> 01:26:50,026
The view behind you is no joke.

1834
01:26:50,027 --> 01:26:51,326
I know. What an amazing place.

1835
01:26:53,826 --> 01:26:54,925
It was so pretty.

1836
01:26:54,926 --> 01:26:58,197
I had only heard about Marina Bay Sands.

1837
01:26:58,767 --> 01:27:00,866
It was fun even when I didn't do anything.

1838
01:27:01,437 --> 01:27:03,607
I can't believe this place. It's so pretty.

1839
01:27:06,947 --> 01:27:08,006
I can really feel that I am here.

1840
01:27:09,907 --> 01:27:11,477
- Cheers. - Cheers.

1841
01:27:14,187 --> 01:27:18,056
Now that I am drinking beer when I am thirsty...

1842
01:27:18,057 --> 01:27:20,755
Gosh, it's so tasty.

1843
01:27:20,756 --> 01:27:22,357
- It's so tasty. - It's insane.

1844
01:27:23,527 --> 01:27:25,857
I bet we will have tasty food today.

1845
01:27:26,897 --> 01:27:27,897
It's here.

1846
01:27:30,137 --> 01:27:32,036
- Pasta looks delicious. - I know.

1847
01:27:32,496 --> 01:27:34,766
And this. Thank you.

1848
01:27:34,767 --> 01:27:36,336
- I will take photos. - Okay.

1849
01:27:36,876 --> 01:27:38,137
You know,

1850
01:27:38,836 --> 01:27:40,675
- the serving size isn't big. - That's right.

1851
01:27:40,676 --> 01:27:41,777
It's cute and nice.

1852
01:27:42,506 --> 01:27:43,576
Thank you.

1853
01:27:44,777 --> 01:27:45,777
My goodness.

1854
01:27:58,756 --> 01:28:00,966
The taste hits you even when you don't chew it, right?

1855
01:28:04,966 --> 01:28:05,966
Thank you.

1856
01:28:08,006 --> 01:28:10,536
- This one? - Yes. How does the burger look?

1857
01:28:13,647 --> 01:28:14,647
Thank you.

1858
01:28:16,746 --> 01:28:19,316
I think we did a good job of choosing the menu.

1859
01:28:19,317 --> 01:28:21,687
We did a good job last time too. Everything was tasty, right?

1860
01:28:23,817 --> 01:28:24,857
It's seriously insane.

1861
01:28:29,027 --> 01:28:30,897
Your pupils came back.

1862
01:28:31,397 --> 01:28:32,697
- Do I look more lively now? - Yes.

1863
01:28:34,527 --> 01:28:36,466
We have spent time together for two weeks now.

1864
01:28:36,567 --> 01:28:38,137
How were the past two weeks?

1865
01:28:38,597 --> 01:28:39,767
The past two weeks?

1866
01:28:40,407 --> 01:28:42,267
They passed in a blur,

1867
01:28:43,466 --> 01:28:44,977
so I had a lot of disappointment.

1868
01:28:45,676 --> 01:28:48,977
But during that time, I went on dates...

1869
01:28:49,477 --> 01:28:50,746
and had a lot of conversations.

1870
01:28:51,647 --> 01:28:54,215
I think I made the best effort...

1871
01:28:54,216 --> 01:28:56,245
to spend the time well, so I have no regrets.

1872
01:28:56,246 --> 01:28:57,317
I have no regrets.

1873
01:28:57,817 --> 01:29:00,256
But I just wish that I had more conversations.

1874
01:29:01,187 --> 01:29:04,156
If I had used the bunker,

1875
01:29:04,157 --> 01:29:06,897
- it would have been nice. - That's right.

1876
01:29:08,926 --> 01:29:09,926
How about you?

1877
01:29:09,927 --> 01:29:11,696
At first, I was nervous.

1878
01:29:11,697 --> 01:29:13,637
- Right. - I tried to be comfortable,

1879
01:29:14,006 --> 01:29:15,936
but it didn't come naturally.

1880
01:29:15,937 --> 01:29:17,006
I had to make an effort to be comfortable.

1881
01:29:19,376 --> 01:29:20,976
At one point, I had this thought.

1882
01:29:20,977 --> 01:29:25,576
"I won't get another chance to have a special time..."

1883
01:29:26,317 --> 01:29:28,786
"like this one." I had that thought.

1884
01:29:30,017 --> 01:29:31,357
Since then,

1885
01:29:32,157 --> 01:29:35,226
I have tried to follow my heart.

1886
01:29:35,227 --> 01:29:36,657
Since then, time has passed more quickly.

1887
01:29:37,496 --> 01:29:39,597
I was the same. At first,

1888
01:29:40,567 --> 01:29:42,295
I was too nervous...

1889
01:29:42,296 --> 01:29:45,336
to focus on my own emotions.

1890
01:29:46,267 --> 01:29:47,336
It was like that.

1891
01:29:47,437 --> 01:29:50,166
I was hesitant about expressing myself.

1892
01:29:50,407 --> 01:29:53,776
But deciding to follow my heart...

1893
01:29:53,777 --> 01:29:56,147
let me express myself more freely.

1894
01:29:56,706 --> 01:29:59,176
- It let me be more honest. - Right.

1895
01:30:02,687 --> 01:30:04,756
I have a question. Are you doing the same?

1896
01:30:05,456 --> 01:30:06,786
- Of course. - Really?

1897
01:30:07,357 --> 01:30:08,727
I can't think about what will come afterward.

1898
01:30:09,487 --> 01:30:11,326
I can't predict the changes...

1899
01:30:11,527 --> 01:30:14,027
and future events.

1900
01:30:15,097 --> 01:30:16,296
I think I am the same.

1901
01:30:17,567 --> 01:30:21,237
In the past, we could only manage a quick chat here and there.

1902
01:30:21,336 --> 01:30:25,476
It felt like having a proper date after a long while.

1903
01:30:25,477 --> 01:30:29,406
I felt that our conversation was becoming deeper...

1904
01:30:29,407 --> 01:30:30,415
and more comfortable.

1905
01:30:30,416 --> 01:30:34,146
The two of us will have an entire day to ourselves,

1906
01:30:34,147 --> 01:30:36,116
so I will get to know more about her.

1907
01:30:36,487 --> 01:30:40,625
I will also be able to understand my emotions better.

1908
01:30:40,626 --> 01:30:42,357
I had that thought.

1909
01:30:43,157 --> 01:30:45,397
- It's a trip. - It's a trip.

1910
01:30:46,126 --> 01:30:47,197
It's a trip.

1911
01:30:48,296 --> 01:30:49,966
- Look. - This is incredible.

1912
01:30:50,597 --> 01:30:52,597
This is incredible.

1913
01:30:54,307 --> 01:30:55,406
I feel like I am on a trip.

1914
01:30:55,407 --> 01:30:56,665
Seriously. Gosh.

1915
01:30:56,666 --> 01:30:59,907
- Gosh, it's pretty. - Seriously.

1916
01:31:00,876 --> 01:31:02,206
I am in a good mood.

1917
01:31:09,116 --> 01:31:11,086
This neighborhood feels like Europe.

1918
01:31:11,557 --> 01:31:12,687
This is the place.

1919
01:31:14,527 --> 01:31:15,857
(My goodness)

1920
01:31:16,956 --> 01:31:18,897
This is incredible.

1921
01:31:19,926 --> 01:31:21,826
It's so nice.

1922
01:31:23,197 --> 01:31:25,697
It's so nice. I am so excited.

1923
01:31:26,597 --> 01:31:29,067
(Se Seung and Jung Sub, Shrimp Prawn Food)

1924
01:31:29,607 --> 01:31:31,307
This is insane.

1925
01:31:32,176 --> 01:31:33,237
What am I going to do?

1926
01:31:36,907 --> 01:31:37,947
It's so nice.

1927
01:31:52,227 --> 01:31:56,067
It makes no sense that we are here.

1928
01:31:56,166 --> 01:31:57,697
I really can't believe it.

1929
01:32:00,666 --> 01:32:02,266
(The food they ordered is here.)

1930
01:32:02,267 --> 01:32:03,407
Hello.

1931
01:32:05,076 --> 01:32:07,846
- Gosh, it's no joke. - It's no joke.

1932
01:32:07,847 --> 01:32:09,847
Gosh, it's insane.

1933
01:32:10,147 --> 01:32:12,746
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

1934
01:32:21,626 --> 01:32:22,626
It's tasty.

1935
01:32:24,597 --> 01:32:25,697
What is this?

1936
01:32:27,366 --> 01:32:28,866
I should come to Singapore often.

1937
01:32:31,697 --> 01:32:33,165
Try the meat. Have you tried the meat?

1938
01:32:33,166 --> 01:32:35,137
- No, I haven't. - It melts in the mouth.

1939
01:32:36,166 --> 01:32:38,437
- I was so surprised. - It's so tasty.

1940
01:32:39,107 --> 01:32:40,476
- What should I do? - Please hurry up and try it.

1941
01:32:40,477 --> 01:32:41,477
Okay.

1942
01:32:43,746 --> 01:32:44,776
What do you think?

1943
01:32:44,777 --> 01:32:46,347
- It's insane. - It's amazing, right?

1944
01:32:46,576 --> 01:32:49,387
How does it melt in the mouth? It's like fish.

1945
01:32:50,716 --> 01:32:53,115
I am so happy right now. What am I going to do?

1946
01:32:53,116 --> 01:32:55,456
- I have no regrets. - Seriously.

1947
01:32:56,326 --> 01:32:58,096
We could order another small dish.

1948
01:32:58,097 --> 01:32:59,196
- Right? - Yes. We can eat more.

1949
01:32:59,197 --> 01:33:00,396
- Don't you think it will be okay? - Yes.

1950
01:33:00,397 --> 01:33:01,397
(Cho A and Yong Woo, Date in Singapore)

1951
01:33:02,996 --> 01:33:04,995
I don't know...

1952
01:33:04,996 --> 01:33:07,236
if the way you are on this show is any different...

1953
01:33:07,237 --> 01:33:09,766
from the way you were in the past.

1954
01:33:09,767 --> 01:33:12,505
I never showed tears in the past.

1955
01:33:12,506 --> 01:33:13,607
Really?

1956
01:33:13,876 --> 01:33:17,817
I think it's the special environment we are in...

1957
01:33:17,916 --> 01:33:19,776
made me show...

1958
01:33:19,777 --> 01:33:21,786
such a side.

1959
01:33:22,586 --> 01:33:23,816
I was fascinated by myself too.

1960
01:33:23,817 --> 01:33:26,116
That's right. Was it nice?

1961
01:33:28,987 --> 01:33:31,097
I thought it was nice.

1962
01:33:31,926 --> 01:33:33,557
It's embarrassing, so I should change the topic.

1963
01:33:34,666 --> 01:33:36,926
I should keep talking about it. Why don't I do it once more?

1964
01:33:38,737 --> 01:33:40,965
When you see a new side of yourself...

1965
01:33:40,966 --> 01:33:43,236
- Right. - You become surprised...

1966
01:33:43,237 --> 01:33:44,676
and feel awkward.

1967
01:33:45,107 --> 01:33:47,176
You discover a new self.

1968
01:33:48,907 --> 01:33:49,907
Can you give me an example?

1969
01:33:50,817 --> 01:33:52,647
It's hard to describe it with words.

1970
01:33:52,977 --> 01:33:56,286
When I understand it better...

1971
01:33:56,447 --> 01:33:59,615
and find a way to explain it with refined words,

1972
01:33:59,616 --> 01:34:00,826
I will tell you.

1973
01:34:01,456 --> 01:34:03,286
I think I said this in passing.

1974
01:34:03,387 --> 01:34:05,626
I am not the type...

1975
01:34:06,857 --> 01:34:08,526
to ask someone for advice...

1976
01:34:08,527 --> 01:34:10,027
- regarding my emotions... - That's right.

1977
01:34:10,296 --> 01:34:12,267
and actions.

1978
01:34:16,206 --> 01:34:18,375
- Is there anyone you like? - What?

1979
01:34:18,376 --> 01:34:20,075
Is there anyone you like?

1980
01:34:20,076 --> 01:34:21,076
- Me? - Yes.

1981
01:34:23,876 --> 01:34:25,576
- I didn't think there was. - Okay.

1982
01:34:27,246 --> 01:34:28,546
I didn't think there was.

1983
01:34:29,817 --> 01:34:31,316
- Why? - It was probably the truth.

1984
01:34:31,317 --> 01:34:32,317
- Really? - Yes.

1985
01:34:32,318 --> 01:34:33,857
- In the beginning? - In the beginning.

1986
01:34:41,866 --> 01:34:43,697
When I look back on my actions,

1987
01:34:45,466 --> 01:34:48,107
I don't understand...

1988
01:34:48,366 --> 01:34:49,737
- some of them. - Okay.

1989
01:34:50,607 --> 01:34:53,676
I did things without thinking.

1990
01:34:54,847 --> 01:34:56,746
When I look back on them now,

1991
01:34:57,216 --> 01:34:59,947
it's like, "Was it my way of showing interest?"

1992
01:35:00,277 --> 01:35:01,416
I had that thought.

1993
01:35:01,687 --> 01:35:03,817
What were they? What actions were they?

1994
01:35:04,657 --> 01:35:06,285
I wanted to talk a lot...

1995
01:35:06,286 --> 01:35:08,626
about ourselves.

1996
01:35:08,857 --> 01:35:11,256
I wanted to ask about...

1997
01:35:11,357 --> 01:35:13,826
and check...

1998
01:35:13,926 --> 01:35:17,236
Yong Woo's emotions and thoughts.

1999
01:35:17,237 --> 01:35:19,736
I had an opportunity to go on dates...

2000
01:35:19,737 --> 01:35:21,206
- with various people. - Okay.

2001
01:35:21,506 --> 01:35:23,137
- I think some dates... - Yes.

2002
01:35:23,706 --> 01:35:24,835
happened...

2003
01:35:24,836 --> 01:35:26,107
- without my intention. - Right.

2004
01:35:26,777 --> 01:35:30,847
Even though I spent a lot of time with her,

2005
01:35:31,147 --> 01:35:34,687
I found myself sending the message to the usual person.

2006
01:35:35,947 --> 01:35:38,187
(The day he met Ji Won for the first time)

2007
01:35:38,317 --> 01:35:40,926
(That day, Yong Woo delivered his feelings.)

2008
01:35:40,987 --> 01:35:42,186
(You did well today.)

2009
01:35:42,187 --> 01:35:43,995
(Yong Woo sent a message to Cho A.)

2010
01:35:43,996 --> 01:35:47,596
(Even after enjoying a date with Ji Won all day long)

2011
01:35:47,597 --> 01:35:51,336
(You did well today. I will wake up late tomorrow.)

2012
01:35:51,496 --> 01:35:54,036
(Yong Woo sent a message to Cho A.)

2013
01:35:54,866 --> 01:35:56,005
Was there a reason?

2014
01:35:56,006 --> 01:35:57,535
(Cho A wants to know how Yong Woo feels.)

2015
01:35:57,536 --> 01:35:58,637
I think...

2016
01:35:58,977 --> 01:36:00,506
it was the vibe she gave,

2017
01:36:00,847 --> 01:36:02,506
the way she held a conversation,

2018
01:36:03,407 --> 01:36:07,616
and the things I could feel from her expressions and gestures.

2019
01:36:08,687 --> 01:36:09,987
Without even realizing it,

2020
01:36:12,017 --> 01:36:13,615
- they seeped into me. - Is that so?

2021
01:36:13,616 --> 01:36:15,586
Could you feel those things?

2022
01:36:16,256 --> 01:36:17,426
I think so.

2023
01:36:18,097 --> 01:36:19,527
What do you like the most?

2024
01:36:19,956 --> 01:36:21,296
- What do you mean? - About her.

2025
01:36:21,426 --> 01:36:22,526
(She talks about herself in the third person.)

2026
01:36:22,527 --> 01:36:23,727
- About her? - Yes.

2027
01:36:24,897 --> 01:36:28,005
She makes me a nice person.

2028
01:36:28,006 --> 01:36:30,976
- Really? - She puts me at ease.

2029
01:36:30,977 --> 01:36:32,005
(I see.)

2030
01:36:32,006 --> 01:36:34,107
- She treats me with honesty. - I see.

2031
01:36:34,876 --> 01:36:36,006
She is a nice person.

2032
01:36:36,147 --> 01:36:37,676
Is she a nice person?

2033
01:36:38,017 --> 01:36:39,216
You wouldn't know her.

2034
01:36:40,647 --> 01:36:41,847
Tell me if you get to know her.

2035
01:36:43,487 --> 01:36:45,915
To be honest, I was torn. I was quite torn.

2036
01:36:45,916 --> 01:36:48,255
It would be a lie to say that I no longer have...

2037
01:36:48,256 --> 01:36:50,027
- any hesitations. - Okay.

2038
01:36:50,256 --> 01:36:52,657
But I feel like...

2039
01:36:53,256 --> 01:36:54,527
my thoughts...

2040
01:36:54,897 --> 01:36:56,995
- have become much clearer. - I see.

2041
01:36:56,996 --> 01:37:00,705
"I was torn. That's me being honest."

2042
01:37:00,706 --> 01:37:04,375
"It would be a lie to say that I wasn't torn."

2043
01:37:04,376 --> 01:37:06,636
He was honest with me.

2044
01:37:06,637 --> 01:37:11,676
I was a bit confused about Yong Woo's feelings.

2045
01:37:12,116 --> 01:37:16,746
I have always wanted to check Yong Woo's feelings.

2046
01:37:17,187 --> 01:37:18,517
Didn't she check them?

2047
01:37:18,857 --> 01:37:20,017
She checked them, but...

2048
01:37:20,256 --> 01:37:22,625
- She wants him to be clearer. - She wants to hear more.

2049
01:37:22,626 --> 01:37:24,696
She just received messages from him.

2050
01:37:24,697 --> 01:37:26,495
There hasn't been any special...

2051
01:37:26,496 --> 01:37:29,397
It's her first time hearing him talk about his feelings.

2052
01:37:30,626 --> 01:37:31,995
I have a question.

2053
01:37:31,996 --> 01:37:34,206
Why are you torn when you make a decision?

2054
01:37:35,036 --> 01:37:36,137
Regarding the message?

2055
01:37:39,807 --> 01:37:41,376
Think about it this way.

2056
01:37:42,076 --> 01:37:45,517
Let's say a new person joined.

2057
01:37:45,576 --> 01:37:47,616
- He likes you. - Okay.

2058
01:37:47,847 --> 01:37:50,187
The two of you spend time together that day.

2059
01:37:51,286 --> 01:37:53,086
Sending someone else a message...

2060
01:37:53,216 --> 01:37:55,585
when he is right in front of you...

2061
01:37:55,586 --> 01:37:59,096
- I see. Right. - You could feel guilty.

2062
01:37:59,097 --> 01:38:00,126
Right.

2063
01:38:00,227 --> 01:38:01,626
Let's say...

2064
01:38:02,897 --> 01:38:05,097
that person is charming too.

2065
01:38:05,737 --> 01:38:08,466
Other people might find that person nice too.

2066
01:38:08,666 --> 01:38:09,936
Then you might be torn.

2067
01:38:09,937 --> 01:38:11,737
I say this...

2068
01:38:11,836 --> 01:38:13,336
because she is very charming.

2069
01:38:13,576 --> 01:38:15,276
She is very charming and nice.

2070
01:38:15,277 --> 01:38:16,846
- That's right. - You can't deny that.

2071
01:38:16,847 --> 01:38:17,916
That's right.

2072
01:38:18,216 --> 01:38:19,516
If I say that she isn't,

2073
01:38:19,517 --> 01:38:21,916
I would be lying to appease you.

2074
01:38:23,116 --> 01:38:24,716
I don't want to do that.

2075
01:38:27,286 --> 01:38:28,886
He is talking about Ji Won.

2076
01:38:28,887 --> 01:38:30,726
I think Yong Woo...

2077
01:38:30,727 --> 01:38:33,657
wanted to be completely honest.

2078
01:38:33,956 --> 01:38:36,925
That's why he is explaining everything.

2079
01:38:36,926 --> 01:38:38,637
I don't know if it was necessary.

2080
01:38:38,966 --> 01:38:40,965
- I also think it was unnecessary. - It was unnecessary.

2081
01:38:40,966 --> 01:38:45,137
I would be a bit disappointed.

2082
01:38:45,237 --> 01:38:47,506
Why is he complimenting another woman in front of her?

2083
01:38:47,676 --> 01:38:49,676
- It's unnecessary. - Things were going so well.

2084
01:38:50,076 --> 01:38:52,246
All I want to hear from a man...

2085
01:38:52,477 --> 01:38:53,516
is that he likes me.

2086
01:38:53,517 --> 01:38:57,045
All he needs to say right now is, "I like you."

2087
01:38:57,046 --> 01:38:58,255
It's true.

2088
01:38:58,256 --> 01:38:59,356
Yes, it's true.

2089
01:38:59,357 --> 01:39:00,826
And anyone...

2090
01:39:01,387 --> 01:39:02,656
can see that.

2091
01:39:02,657 --> 01:39:04,696
- It's the result of two weeks. - Yes.

2092
01:39:04,697 --> 01:39:07,896
- He was too honest. - During this conversation,

2093
01:39:07,897 --> 01:39:09,726
he should have said, "I am 100 percent sure about you."

2094
01:39:09,727 --> 01:39:11,697
- She wanted to hear that. - She wanted to hear that.

2095
01:39:12,666 --> 01:39:14,566
She is very charming and nice.

2096
01:39:14,567 --> 01:39:16,437
- That's right. - You can't deny that.

2097
01:39:17,206 --> 01:39:18,535
If I say that she isn't,

2098
01:39:18,536 --> 01:39:20,876
I would be lying to appease you.

2099
01:39:22,246 --> 01:39:23,777
I don't want to do that.

2100
01:39:26,246 --> 01:39:28,886
He said that woman was charming.

2101
01:39:28,887 --> 01:39:32,715
I thought, "Why is he telling me that another woman was charming?"

2102
01:39:32,716 --> 01:39:36,526
"If I were him, I wouldn't say such things..."

2103
01:39:36,527 --> 01:39:38,956
"in front of someone I liked."

2104
01:39:39,597 --> 01:39:41,796
She might think this way.

2105
01:39:41,966 --> 01:39:44,165
She expresses herself honestly...

2106
01:39:44,166 --> 01:39:47,336
- when it comes to her emotions. - Okay.

2107
01:39:47,907 --> 01:39:50,466
But that man sends...

2108
01:39:51,107 --> 01:39:53,737
a lot of witty messages.

2109
01:39:54,607 --> 01:39:55,676
- So... - I wouldn't know.

2110
01:39:55,876 --> 01:39:57,977
- That was what I heard. - I see.

2111
01:39:58,616 --> 01:40:00,647
So I think...

2112
01:40:00,817 --> 01:40:02,746
the woman would be a bit confused.

2113
01:40:04,116 --> 01:40:05,585
Since she received messages,

2114
01:40:05,586 --> 01:40:08,157
she just assumes that he has an interest in her.

2115
01:40:09,126 --> 01:40:12,296
But she wouldn't know if he doesn't express himself.

2116
01:40:14,227 --> 01:40:16,026
You can only send a message...

2117
01:40:16,027 --> 01:40:18,097
- to one person, right? - That's right.

2118
01:40:19,666 --> 01:40:22,137
So you don't think the content matters.

2119
01:40:23,067 --> 01:40:24,376
Compared to the message,

2120
01:40:27,006 --> 01:40:28,746
the messenger was probably more important...

2121
01:40:29,876 --> 01:40:31,046
in that situation.

2122
01:40:32,576 --> 01:40:33,676
Okay.

2123
01:40:35,147 --> 01:40:36,387
I see.

2124
01:40:38,857 --> 01:40:40,926
Maybe it's that man's style.

2125
01:40:41,357 --> 01:40:42,557
I guess so.

2126
01:40:43,387 --> 01:40:44,995
Everyone has his or her style.

2127
01:40:44,996 --> 01:40:46,057
That's right.

2128
01:40:46,256 --> 01:40:49,666
I just think that this moment is important.

2129
01:40:50,097 --> 01:40:52,836
So every message seems precious to me.

2130
01:40:53,366 --> 01:40:57,406
So I thought a lot about putting my sincerity...

2131
01:40:57,407 --> 01:40:58,776
into the text.

2132
01:40:58,777 --> 01:41:02,147
I didn't want to beat around the bush.

2133
01:41:04,546 --> 01:41:05,676
Perhaps you wouldn't know.

2134
01:41:07,647 --> 01:41:09,147
Is that man a bit slow-witted?

2135
01:41:10,616 --> 01:41:14,017
Words are very important to me.

2136
01:41:14,116 --> 01:41:15,955
I feel a sense of comfort...

2137
01:41:15,956 --> 01:41:19,097
when someone expresses himself and gives me certainty.

2138
01:41:19,256 --> 01:41:22,625
But when Yong Woo sends a message,

2139
01:41:22,626 --> 01:41:25,365
he just tries to be entertaining.

2140
01:41:25,366 --> 01:41:29,266
There weren't any instances that made me feel,

2141
01:41:29,267 --> 01:41:31,306
"You are the one."

2142
01:41:31,307 --> 01:41:33,535
- There haven't been any instances. - That's right.

2143
01:41:33,536 --> 01:41:35,005
Through actions,

2144
01:41:35,006 --> 01:41:37,506
you need to feel, "This person likes me a lot."

2145
01:41:37,916 --> 01:41:40,277
- You think it's too soon. - That's what I think.

2146
01:41:40,376 --> 01:41:41,987
There is a difference in temperatures.

2147
01:41:42,416 --> 01:41:47,116
I looked at the attitudes and behaviors...

2148
01:41:47,626 --> 01:41:50,886
Yong Woo displayed when he was with me.

2149
01:41:50,887 --> 01:41:54,125
There were a few instances...

2150
01:41:54,126 --> 01:41:57,566
that made me wonder if his feelings were...

2151
01:41:57,567 --> 01:41:59,697
sincere.

2152
01:41:59,796 --> 01:42:01,566
So I wanted to check...

2153
01:42:01,567 --> 01:42:06,076
through his certain words.

2154
01:42:06,907 --> 01:42:09,576
Although I went on dates with other women,

2155
01:42:10,176 --> 01:42:14,347
I sent messages to one person in the end.

2156
01:42:14,817 --> 01:42:17,346
I remember being honest...

2157
01:42:17,347 --> 01:42:21,326
with my feelings when I sent the messages.

2158
01:42:21,586 --> 01:42:24,896
I expressed myself clearly.

2159
01:42:24,897 --> 01:42:25,925
(Yong Woo thinks he expressed himself clearly.)

2160
01:42:25,926 --> 01:42:29,425
Even after going on dates with other people,

2161
01:42:29,426 --> 01:42:30,965
Yong Woo chose Cho A repeatedly.

2162
01:42:30,966 --> 01:42:33,795
He seems to think that it's...

2163
01:42:33,796 --> 01:42:36,705
a big decision and expression.

2164
01:42:36,706 --> 01:42:38,736
I don't understand why they are having...

2165
01:42:38,737 --> 01:42:39,936
that conversation there.

2166
01:42:39,937 --> 01:42:42,006
It's because the woman...

2167
01:42:42,447 --> 01:42:45,817
wants a bigger certainty now.

2168
01:42:45,916 --> 01:42:50,285
Yong Woo has shown grand actions.

2169
01:42:50,286 --> 01:42:52,156
She began to wonder...

2170
01:42:52,157 --> 01:42:54,016
why he wasn't expressing himself the same way.

2171
01:42:54,017 --> 01:42:55,926
- I don't know. This is hard. - "He has done so much."

2172
01:42:56,387 --> 01:42:58,896
"Can't he be more direct? Why not?"

2173
01:42:58,897 --> 01:43:01,026
- It's like that. - After he expresses himself,

2174
01:43:01,027 --> 01:43:02,425
she would want a stronger expression.

2175
01:43:02,426 --> 01:43:04,067
- Basically. - That's right.

2176
01:43:05,366 --> 01:43:08,035
Yong Woo might think,

2177
01:43:08,036 --> 01:43:11,436
- "How much more can I be certain?" - That's right.

2178
01:43:11,437 --> 01:43:13,406
He might think that way.

2179
01:43:13,407 --> 01:43:15,205
I think...

2180
01:43:15,206 --> 01:43:19,045
- he complimented another woman... - That's right.

2181
01:43:19,046 --> 01:43:22,147
and ended up providing a turning point.

2182
01:43:22,216 --> 01:43:26,216
She began to spot the bad things.

2183
01:43:28,256 --> 01:43:30,086
I relate to both of them.

2184
01:43:30,157 --> 01:43:31,196
- Both of them are understandable. - Yes.

2185
01:43:31,197 --> 01:43:32,697
Both of them shouldn't do that.

2186
01:43:32,956 --> 01:43:34,766
What? What do you mean?

2187
01:43:34,767 --> 01:43:37,995
- Both of them shouldn't do that? - I relate to both of them,

2188
01:43:37,996 --> 01:43:40,397
but I hope that they wouldn't do this now.

2189
01:43:40,496 --> 01:43:42,506
- You mean the conversation. - The date has just begun.

2190
01:43:43,706 --> 01:43:45,005
(The lights begin to turn on.)

2191
01:43:45,006 --> 01:43:46,836
- The lights came on. - Yes.

2192
01:43:47,477 --> 01:43:49,347
- It's prettier in the evening. - Yes.

2193
01:43:50,147 --> 01:43:52,347
I have no expectations of other people.

2194
01:43:53,647 --> 01:43:55,317
I feel like...

2195
01:43:55,416 --> 01:43:56,886
having no expectations...

2196
01:43:56,887 --> 01:44:01,527
improves the relationship.

2197
01:44:02,387 --> 01:44:03,786
The more expectations I have,

2198
01:44:04,157 --> 01:44:05,496
the greater the disappointment becomes.

2199
01:44:06,097 --> 01:44:07,597
- You have no expectations. - I have no expectations.

2200
01:44:08,767 --> 01:44:12,496
I think I know what you mean by that.

2201
01:44:13,097 --> 01:44:14,365
I think I do.

2202
01:44:14,366 --> 01:44:17,637
You can't help but have expectations...

2203
01:44:18,107 --> 01:44:20,336
when the relationship becomes deeper.

2204
01:44:20,807 --> 01:44:22,576
- I try not to have expectations. - You try.

2205
01:44:22,706 --> 01:44:25,046
That way, I become twice as happy when something good happens.

2206
01:44:25,746 --> 01:44:26,876
I see.

2207
01:44:27,277 --> 01:44:28,687
I am like that.

2208
01:44:29,246 --> 01:44:31,887
That's why I have fun. Unexpected events happen.

2209
01:44:33,017 --> 01:44:35,256
That made me hesitant.

2210
01:44:36,527 --> 01:44:39,196
One thought suddenly entered my mind.

2211
01:44:39,197 --> 01:44:43,896
It seemed like I was pushing him too much.

2212
01:44:43,897 --> 01:44:46,335
I thought it was the right time...

2213
01:44:46,336 --> 01:44:49,505
to express our feelings...

2214
01:44:49,506 --> 01:44:50,906
more openly.

2215
01:44:50,907 --> 01:44:52,835
But unless I ask,

2216
01:44:52,836 --> 01:44:55,876
Yong Woo doesn't talk about such things.

2217
01:44:56,607 --> 01:44:58,616
- It's prettier in the evening. - Yes.

2218
01:44:59,576 --> 01:45:02,916
But the more I like him, the more anxious I become.

2219
01:45:03,416 --> 01:45:07,116
Maybe I am afraid of losing what I have now.

2220
01:45:09,256 --> 01:45:12,357
I want to have things checked.

2221
01:45:13,326 --> 01:45:14,995
Things are certain,

2222
01:45:14,996 --> 01:45:17,466
but I want to have them checked with more certainty.

2223
01:45:17,796 --> 01:45:20,335
People say you seem like a cat, but I think you seem like a puppy.

2224
01:45:20,336 --> 01:45:21,836
- Do I seem like a puppy? - Yes.

2225
01:45:22,536 --> 01:45:23,767
Cats are coy.

2226
01:45:25,676 --> 01:45:26,836
Am I not coy?

2227
01:45:26,937 --> 01:45:28,676
I am beginning to know you more.

2228
01:45:29,807 --> 01:45:31,147
- I seem like a puppy. - Yes.

2229
01:45:31,246 --> 01:45:32,817
You have that side.

2230
01:45:38,357 --> 01:45:41,426
(Se Seung and Jung Sub, Date in Singapore)

2231
01:45:41,786 --> 01:45:43,687
I think we get along really well.

2232
01:45:44,727 --> 01:45:46,657
I have a question.

2233
01:45:48,897 --> 01:45:50,526
When we had the Cupid Date,

2234
01:45:50,527 --> 01:45:52,397
did you send a message knowing that it was me?

2235
01:45:53,197 --> 01:45:54,936
I made a mistake.

2236
01:45:54,937 --> 01:45:55,937
Really?

2237
01:45:55,938 --> 01:45:57,737
I sent it to Ju Yeon.

2238
01:45:59,506 --> 01:46:00,536
What?

2239
01:46:00,777 --> 01:46:03,076
Everyone sent it to Ju Yeon except for Ju Yeon.

2240
01:46:03,447 --> 01:46:04,977
How did that happen?

2241
01:46:06,546 --> 01:46:08,285
Everyone sent it to Ju Yeon,

2242
01:46:08,286 --> 01:46:10,615
so Yong Woo chose a message.

2243
01:46:10,616 --> 01:46:13,357
The remaining ones went to you and Jae Hyung.

2244
01:46:14,317 --> 01:46:16,187
I see.

2245
01:46:23,866 --> 01:46:26,035
Then whose message was it? Was it yours?

2246
01:46:26,036 --> 01:46:27,097
Yes.

2247
01:46:30,807 --> 01:46:33,376
I see. So that was how it happened.

2248
01:46:34,006 --> 01:46:36,307
It moved down the ranks.

2249
01:46:39,347 --> 01:46:40,447
I didn't know.

2250
01:46:41,916 --> 01:46:43,545
I thought...

2251
01:46:43,546 --> 01:46:45,715
Se Seung had given a card to my sister...

2252
01:46:45,716 --> 01:46:48,226
in order to pick me.

2253
01:46:48,227 --> 01:46:51,086
But Se Seung had given it to Ju Yeon.

2254
01:46:51,227 --> 01:46:52,856
She said it as if it was nothing.

2255
01:46:52,857 --> 01:46:54,897
It was completely different from what I knew.

2256
01:46:55,866 --> 01:46:56,926
I was like, "What?"

2257
01:46:57,826 --> 01:47:00,637
Whom did you want to see?

2258
01:47:10,206 --> 01:47:11,317
You.

2259
01:47:11,416 --> 01:47:12,777
Other than Yong Woo.

2260
01:47:13,416 --> 01:47:14,615
I said it was you.

2261
01:47:14,616 --> 01:47:17,215
Gosh, this is no fun.

2262
01:47:17,216 --> 01:47:18,387
It's true.

2263
01:47:32,237 --> 01:47:34,666
- What's wrong with him? - What is he doing? Hold on. What?

2264
01:47:35,536 --> 01:47:36,666
It's true.

2265
01:47:36,937 --> 01:47:39,575
- Did she answer too late? - Here is what I don't understand.

2266
01:47:39,576 --> 01:47:41,906
- They are abroad. - Why are they doing that?

2267
01:47:41,907 --> 01:47:43,976
Is that the only conversation...

2268
01:47:43,977 --> 01:47:45,715
- they can have? - Exactly.

2269
01:47:45,716 --> 01:47:47,816
- What a waste. Look at the scenery. - That's what I am saying.

2270
01:47:47,817 --> 01:47:50,946
Why aren't they focusing on the present?

2271
01:47:50,947 --> 01:47:54,057
Why do they bring up the past and misunderstand?

2272
01:47:54,256 --> 01:47:57,026
They could just ask and answer honestly.

2273
01:47:57,027 --> 01:47:59,056
But they skip over the important things.

2274
01:47:59,057 --> 01:48:00,857
- Then thoughts... - Misunderstandings come.

2275
01:48:01,157 --> 01:48:03,266
- fill their heads. - One thought leads to another.

2276
01:48:03,267 --> 01:48:05,896
I think they asked the questions...

2277
01:48:05,897 --> 01:48:08,636
because they expected certain answers...

2278
01:48:08,637 --> 01:48:10,665
- at first. - Yes. That was what happened.

2279
01:48:10,666 --> 01:48:13,075
- But the answers... - They were unexpected.

2280
01:48:13,076 --> 01:48:14,376
made them serious.

2281
01:48:14,977 --> 01:48:16,477
What are you thinking about?

2282
01:48:18,216 --> 01:48:20,746
I found out about the reality.

2283
01:48:23,616 --> 01:48:25,086
So that was how it happened.

2284
01:48:27,756 --> 01:48:30,687
I thought Ju Yeon...

2285
01:48:31,626 --> 01:48:33,057
I am full.

2286
01:48:36,296 --> 01:48:37,296
My goodness.

2287
01:48:37,297 --> 01:48:39,365
Had it been my usual self, I would have told him.

2288
01:48:39,366 --> 01:48:42,766
But since I had my worries about Jung Sub,

2289
01:48:42,767 --> 01:48:46,006
I didn't want to show him all of my cards.

2290
01:48:48,607 --> 01:48:50,847
Forget it. It's all in the past.

2291
01:48:51,347 --> 01:48:53,817
It was the 1st or 2nd day.

2292
01:48:55,817 --> 01:48:58,057
You can't only go on dates with people you want.

2293
01:49:02,286 --> 01:49:03,756
I am curious about something too.

2294
01:49:05,557 --> 01:49:07,995
When you had a date at Gangwon Province,

2295
01:49:07,996 --> 01:49:09,966
why didn't you choose someone you were curious about?

2296
01:49:10,727 --> 01:49:12,697
- What? - For a date at Gangwon Province,

2297
01:49:13,197 --> 01:49:14,266
you had to choose someone other than me.

2298
01:49:14,267 --> 01:49:15,336
Yes.

2299
01:49:15,506 --> 01:49:18,276
You didn't choose someone you were curious about.

2300
01:49:18,277 --> 01:49:19,806
Didn't you choose Cho A?

2301
01:49:19,807 --> 01:49:20,906
- That's right. - Yes.

2302
01:49:20,907 --> 01:49:22,175
- I was curious about her. - Were you curious about Cho A?

2303
01:49:22,176 --> 01:49:24,076
- Yes. Why? - I see.

2304
01:49:24,506 --> 01:49:26,415
I thought you were curious about Ji Won.

2305
01:49:26,416 --> 01:49:28,386
- Why? - You drank with Ji Won...

2306
01:49:28,387 --> 01:49:30,386
until the morning...

2307
01:49:30,387 --> 01:49:32,056
because you were curious about her.

2308
01:49:32,057 --> 01:49:34,557
Yes. Both Ji Won and Cho A...

2309
01:49:34,956 --> 01:49:38,126
are calm. They don't talk much.

2310
01:49:38,796 --> 01:49:39,897
So I was curious about her.

2311
01:49:47,466 --> 01:49:49,505
I found out that day...

2312
01:49:49,506 --> 01:49:50,907
that Jung Sub had an interest in Cho A.

2313
01:49:51,006 --> 01:49:52,907
I was confused.

2314
01:49:54,637 --> 01:49:57,676
Let's say Cupid was a man...

2315
01:49:57,947 --> 01:49:59,615
and you didn't know about the siblings.

2316
01:49:59,616 --> 01:50:01,277
- I... - To whom would you have given it?

2317
01:50:02,716 --> 01:50:04,716
If the situation was reversed?

2318
01:50:19,536 --> 01:50:23,536
I think I would have given it to Jae Hyung or Cheol Hyeon.

2319
01:50:25,176 --> 01:50:26,477
With the knowledge?

2320
01:50:26,977 --> 01:50:30,676
Cheol Hyeon and Cho A seemed like siblings.

2321
01:50:32,216 --> 01:50:33,615
They seemed like siblings.

2322
01:50:33,616 --> 01:50:37,017
Even on the first day, I thought, "They look like siblings."

2323
01:50:54,737 --> 01:50:56,706
What are you thinking?

2324
01:50:56,907 --> 01:50:58,907
- Nothing much. - Really?

2325
01:51:02,647 --> 01:51:04,006
The lights came on.

2326
01:51:11,086 --> 01:51:13,085
"Jung Sub doesn't have..."

2327
01:51:13,086 --> 01:51:15,056
"a lot of interest in me."

2328
01:51:15,057 --> 01:51:17,987
I could tell.

2329
01:51:18,256 --> 01:51:21,696
I had to keep asking him out on a date.

2330
01:51:21,697 --> 01:51:24,665
To Jung Sub, I was the only option.

2331
01:51:24,666 --> 01:51:25,966
That thought...

2332
01:51:25,996 --> 01:51:27,996
put me in a bad mood.

2333
01:51:29,267 --> 01:51:31,407
- They are having a fountain show. - Really?

2334
01:51:31,836 --> 01:51:34,506
- Where? You are right. - The water came out.

2335
01:51:52,496 --> 01:51:54,825
(I reveal everything.)

2336
01:51:54,826 --> 01:51:56,165
(That isn't true at all.)

2337
01:51:56,166 --> 01:51:57,567
(- Me? - Yes.)

2338
01:51:57,826 --> 01:51:59,136
(How about you?)

2339
01:51:59,137 --> 01:52:01,236
(I try to conceal things, but it doesn't work.)

2340
01:52:01,237 --> 01:52:03,566
(You tried to conceal things and it worked.)

2341
01:52:03,567 --> 01:52:05,106
(I still don't know who you are.)

2342
01:52:05,107 --> 01:52:06,476
(I don't know who you are either.)

2343
01:52:06,477 --> 01:52:07,806
(You want the date to end, right?)

2344
01:52:07,807 --> 01:52:08,947
(I want it.)

2345
01:52:10,477 --> 01:52:12,316
(Compared to the time we had the first date,)

2346
01:52:12,317 --> 01:52:14,017
(we became more comfortable.)

2347
01:52:15,517 --> 01:52:18,045
(We spent time by ourselves.)

2348
01:52:18,046 --> 01:52:19,316
(It was really nice.)

2349
01:52:19,317 --> 01:52:21,756
(It was perfect.)

2350
01:52:22,687 --> 01:52:24,386
(It's like a dream.)

2351
01:52:24,387 --> 01:52:26,625
(When I look back on the past 2 weeks,)

2352
01:52:26,626 --> 01:52:29,495
(this is one of the best moments.)

2353
01:52:29,496 --> 01:52:30,566
(Really?)

2354
01:52:30,567 --> 01:52:33,296
(I hoped that time would pass more slowly.)

2355
01:52:33,466 --> 01:52:34,897
Is it the best moment?

2356
01:52:34,966 --> 01:52:37,835
(Spending time with Cho A was fun.)

2357
01:52:37,836 --> 01:52:42,676
(I sensed for the first time that we were sharing the same moment.)

2358
01:52:44,246 --> 01:52:46,215
(They hope that the first day in Singapore...)

2359
01:52:46,216 --> 01:52:48,216
(will pass without any accidents.)
