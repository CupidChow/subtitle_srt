1
00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:02,342
(For the first time today, I made a neutral decision.)

2
00:00:02,343 --> 00:00:06,512
(Everyone was drowning in thoughts at night.)

3
00:00:06,513 --> 00:00:08,982
(I think the person Yong Woo is into...)

4
00:00:08,983 --> 00:00:10,552
(is Ji Won.)

5
00:00:10,553 --> 00:00:12,592
(It was the only time I considered texting someone else.)

6
00:00:12,593 --> 00:00:14,823
(She was so similar to me.)

7
00:00:17,062 --> 00:00:20,131
(But I'm not completely unsweet.)

8
00:00:20,132 --> 00:00:23,402
(Ji Won and Jae Hyung had their second date in Singapore.)

9
00:00:23,403 --> 00:00:26,702
(What's the most beautiful thing you've seen in Singapore?)

10
00:00:29,702 --> 00:00:31,271
(There has also been a sense of emptiness that...)

11
00:00:31,272 --> 00:00:32,811
(I haven't been able to resolve for a long time.)

12
00:00:32,812 --> 00:00:36,843
(I think I felt that a little in that moment.)

13
00:00:38,852 --> 00:00:41,182
(2 days left until the final decision)

14
00:00:41,183 --> 00:00:43,652
(The last date is the secret date.)

15
00:00:43,653 --> 00:00:45,692
(You can choose up to two people...)

16
00:00:45,693 --> 00:00:48,362
(you want to meet secretly tomorrow.)

17
00:00:48,363 --> 00:00:49,461
- Jung Sub. - Se Seung.

18
00:00:49,462 --> 00:00:50,521
- Yun Ha. - It's not over...

19
00:00:50,522 --> 00:00:51,762
(It's not over until it is over.)

20
00:00:51,763 --> 00:00:53,892
(I'll do everything I want, so there are no regrets.)

21
00:00:54,032 --> 00:00:56,001
(Including a number of mutual selection,)

22
00:00:56,002 --> 00:00:58,162
(a total of 9 secret dates have been planned.)

23
00:00:58,233 --> 00:01:01,273
(Cho A and Yong Woo met up that night in the terrace.)

24
00:01:01,642 --> 00:01:03,272
(The peaches were very tasty.)

25
00:01:03,273 --> 00:01:06,471
(You know that we shouldn't confuse each other at this point, right?)

26
00:01:06,472 --> 00:01:09,682
(Cho A received a text message from Yong Woo.)

27
00:01:09,683 --> 00:01:12,512
(I wanted to check the meaning behind the message.)

28
00:01:12,513 --> 00:01:14,812
(Was that the only meaning behind the message?)

29
00:01:16,483 --> 00:01:17,523
(I don't know.)

30
00:01:19,952 --> 00:01:21,861
(I felt like...)

31
00:01:21,862 --> 00:01:27,061
(I didn't have many ways to get to know you.)

32
00:01:27,062 --> 00:01:30,962
(I needed to talk to you at a place without all the people.)

33
00:01:30,963 --> 00:01:32,232
(I see that it's still hard...)

34
00:01:32,233 --> 00:01:34,171
(- for you. - Yes, I worry about it a lot.)

35
00:01:34,172 --> 00:01:35,772
(Is Jae Hyung's tendency a lot more different...)

36
00:01:35,773 --> 00:01:37,343
(from my own than I thought?)

37
00:01:37,442 --> 00:01:45,353
(A long night has passed with 2 days left until the final decision.)

38
00:01:54,392 --> 00:01:57,523
(1 day left until the final decision)

39
00:02:04,303 --> 00:02:07,903
(Secret date)

40
00:02:08,803 --> 00:02:10,202
Gosh, this is hard.

41
00:02:10,203 --> 00:02:11,303
Do you have a lot on your mind?

42
00:02:11,643 --> 00:02:12,941
I have a question.

43
00:02:12,942 --> 00:02:14,173
What did you guys talk about yesterday?

44
00:02:14,613 --> 00:02:16,782
He said he wanted to get to know me more after the filming.

45
00:02:16,942 --> 00:02:18,352
- After the filming? - Yes.

46
00:02:19,053 --> 00:02:21,352
Because he's certain about that,

47
00:02:21,782 --> 00:02:24,881
he doesn't need any more time here.

48
00:02:24,882 --> 00:02:28,562
That's why he doesn't show me who he is entirely.

49
00:02:28,893 --> 00:02:31,321
I don't think he wants to show me that here.

50
00:02:31,322 --> 00:02:32,593
He just wants to do that after the filming.

51
00:02:32,662 --> 00:02:34,291
It's making me wonder...

52
00:02:34,292 --> 00:02:36,362
if it's the right decision to choose him...

53
00:02:36,363 --> 00:02:38,433
after only knowing a part of him.

54
00:02:38,732 --> 00:02:41,132
He's the most confusing one to figure out.

55
00:02:42,602 --> 00:02:43,903
(Exhaling)

56
00:02:45,213 --> 00:02:46,412
(Sighing)

57
00:02:46,873 --> 00:02:48,683
I'm not really sure anymore.

58
00:02:49,542 --> 00:02:53,113
Is Ji Won's feeling toward me not serious at all?

59
00:02:53,982 --> 00:02:55,322
You should ask her that today.

60
00:02:56,352 --> 00:02:58,592
There are times I can't understand...

61
00:02:58,593 --> 00:03:00,252
what she says.

62
00:03:00,653 --> 00:03:03,662
It feels like she's beating around the bush.

63
00:03:05,493 --> 00:03:08,762
If we have an option of not choosing anyone...

64
00:03:09,162 --> 00:03:10,863
Would that complicate things for you?

65
00:03:11,132 --> 00:03:12,971
(Thinking)

66
00:03:12,972 --> 00:03:14,072
- Yes. Because... - What?

67
00:03:14,732 --> 00:03:17,143
The biggest reason is fear that I may be rejected.

68
00:03:17,602 --> 00:03:21,143
(They have a lot on their mind before the secret date.)

69
00:03:21,512 --> 00:03:23,743
Shall we go and have brunch? Let's go.

70
00:03:23,843 --> 00:03:25,553
Like the last supper.

71
00:03:26,453 --> 00:03:28,053
It feels a bit weird.

72
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:29,782
It really feels weird.

73
00:03:30,553 --> 00:03:33,123
But it might be fun on the contrary.

74
00:03:33,322 --> 00:03:35,191
We won't know who will talk to whom...

75
00:03:35,192 --> 00:03:36,523
and what they'll talk about.

76
00:03:36,923 --> 00:03:39,433
Do you think a lot can change after this secret date?

77
00:03:39,493 --> 00:03:42,002
Me? Nothing will change with me.

78
00:03:42,232 --> 00:03:43,433
Do you talk to Ji Won a lot?

79
00:03:44,002 --> 00:03:45,302
We talked yesterday and today.

80
00:03:45,303 --> 00:03:47,902
I realized a lot that I didn't know my sister that well.

81
00:03:47,903 --> 00:03:49,571
- Right. - Yesterday, I knew it...

82
00:03:49,572 --> 00:03:51,002
after looking at her face.

83
00:03:51,502 --> 00:03:52,912
You knew it after seeing her face yesterday?

84
00:03:53,072 --> 00:03:54,442
I knew it after seeing her face yesterday.

85
00:03:54,542 --> 00:03:55,942
(I see.)

86
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:03,053
(It suddenly starts pouring down.)

87
00:04:03,352 --> 00:04:04,523
- It's raining. - Yes.

88
00:04:05,653 --> 00:04:06,893
What a refreshing rain.

89
00:04:08,492 --> 00:04:09,922
(Sighing)

90
00:04:10,492 --> 00:04:11,693
(Sighing)

91
00:04:13,563 --> 00:04:16,133
I said I didn't need more time.

92
00:04:16,633 --> 00:04:18,532
I might need more time after all.

(Episode 15: Secret)

105
00:05:31,242 --> 00:05:33,313
Gosh. The weather suddenly cleared up.

106
00:05:38,112 --> 00:05:39,652
- Ji Won. Did you finish eating? - Yes.

107
00:05:39,653 --> 00:05:41,481
- You... Yes. - Can you take a picture of me?

108
00:05:41,482 --> 00:05:43,023
- Let me take a picture of you. - Okay.

109
00:05:43,653 --> 00:05:44,722
Please.

110
00:05:45,422 --> 00:05:46,622
You look cool.

111
00:05:47,922 --> 00:05:49,063
(Sounding impressed)

112
00:05:50,093 --> 00:05:51,692
- You look cool. Another spot. - Do I look okay?

113
00:05:51,693 --> 00:05:52,792
(Taken aback)

114
00:05:55,862 --> 00:05:57,531
- Don't fall into the pool. - Okay.

115
00:05:57,532 --> 00:05:58,532
I'm keeping my safe distance.

116
00:06:01,672 --> 00:06:03,242
Why is he washing his hands there?

117
00:06:03,343 --> 00:06:04,642
Why is he washing his hands there?

118
00:06:04,643 --> 00:06:05,942
He's pretending to wash his hands.

119
00:06:05,943 --> 00:06:07,943
- He's washing his hands? - I mean...

120
00:06:08,042 --> 00:06:10,083
- That came out of nowhere. - He can't interrupt them.

121
00:06:10,242 --> 00:06:12,611
- Let me explain what's going on. - That's scary.

122
00:06:12,612 --> 00:06:14,481
If they are interested in each other and want to get to know each other,

123
00:06:14,482 --> 00:06:16,851
- they can't act like that. - Right.

124
00:06:16,852 --> 00:06:19,022
Because there's nothing going on between them,

125
00:06:19,023 --> 00:06:22,661
they can easily interact like that without any sense of pressure.

126
00:06:22,662 --> 00:06:25,232
On the surface, it looks as if there was nothing going on.

127
00:06:26,032 --> 00:06:27,492
So there's no stress between them.

128
00:06:27,662 --> 00:06:28,861
- Really? - I see.

129
00:06:28,862 --> 00:06:31,362
I guess Jae Hyung feels insecure about her.

130
00:06:32,372 --> 00:06:33,872
- Don't fall into the pool. - Okay.

131
00:06:33,903 --> 00:06:35,032
I'm keeping my safe distance.

132
00:06:42,513 --> 00:06:43,943
Okay. Another spot.

133
00:06:44,143 --> 00:06:45,253
Find another spot.

134
00:06:46,653 --> 00:06:48,052
Why don't you lie down there?

135
00:06:48,213 --> 00:06:50,122
Here? It's not as wet as I thought.

136
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:52,653
That could've been bad.

137
00:06:52,922 --> 00:06:54,023
I was like an assassin.

138
00:06:54,193 --> 00:06:57,422
- You know? I was an assassin. - You almost killed it.

139
00:06:57,763 --> 00:06:59,963
You look rich.

140
00:07:00,193 --> 00:07:01,633
- Do I? - It's like you own this house.

141
00:07:02,362 --> 00:07:04,232
- You must've signed the contract. - Yes.

142
00:07:04,932 --> 00:07:06,203
(Oh, my)

143
00:07:07,172 --> 00:07:08,203
You look great.

144
00:07:09,602 --> 00:07:11,472
- You look like an American. - Exactly.

145
00:07:11,643 --> 00:07:12,713
Hello.

146
00:07:12,872 --> 00:07:14,372
Let me take another one up close.

147
00:07:17,982 --> 00:07:19,383
- Are the pictures coming out well? - Yes.

148
00:07:19,883 --> 00:07:21,282
Right? Doesn't he look like a wealthy guy?

149
00:07:22,852 --> 00:07:24,052
You look rich.

150
00:07:25,552 --> 00:07:28,253
- The photos are coming out nicely. - The photos are coming out nicely.

151
00:07:29,823 --> 00:07:30,992
Is Ji Yeon good at taking pictures?

152
00:07:32,063 --> 00:07:33,931
I didn't take that many pictures with Ji Yeon.

153
00:07:33,932 --> 00:07:35,503
Her name is Ji Won.

154
00:07:35,662 --> 00:07:37,502
- That's what I said. - I thought you said "Ju Yeon."

155
00:07:37,503 --> 00:07:38,562
- I always... - Who is it?

156
00:07:38,563 --> 00:07:40,072
- get confused by their names. - Did he say it wrong?

157
00:07:40,073 --> 00:07:41,203
Or did you hear it wrong?

158
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:43,343
- Let's say I misheard it. - No.

159
00:07:44,872 --> 00:07:45,971
Shall we get going?

160
00:07:45,972 --> 00:07:47,911
- Let's go. - Let's go.

161
00:07:47,912 --> 00:07:49,281
- Let's go. - Let's go.

162
00:07:49,282 --> 00:07:51,541
- Let's go. - It was raining only a moment ago.

163
00:07:51,542 --> 00:07:52,582
Right.

164
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:53,713
It rained all of a sudden.

165
00:07:53,953 --> 00:07:55,213
Gosh. It's beautiful.

166
00:07:58,753 --> 00:07:59,791
Hey. Hi.

167
00:07:59,792 --> 00:08:01,592
- Hi. - Hi.

168
00:08:01,593 --> 00:08:03,221
- H-I. - H-I.

169
00:08:03,222 --> 00:08:05,193
- H-I. - What's that? Is that a new meme?

170
00:08:05,662 --> 00:08:07,661
- Hi. - Hi.

171
00:08:07,662 --> 00:08:08,762
(He records a brief moment when everyone is together.)

172
00:08:08,763 --> 00:08:09,832
- H-I. - H-I.

173
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:11,731
- Ji Won, can you join us? - Hi.

174
00:08:11,732 --> 00:08:12,732
- Hi. - H-I.

175
00:08:12,733 --> 00:08:13,801
- Yes. - H-I.

176
00:08:13,802 --> 00:08:14,832
(Satisfied)

177
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,671
- Gosh. The weather is great. - How exciting.

178
00:08:16,672 --> 00:08:17,672
How exciting.

179
00:08:17,673 --> 00:08:18,713
- How exciting. - How exciting.

180
00:08:18,742 --> 00:08:21,573
It's nice. Look at this palm tree. This looks great.

181
00:08:21,742 --> 00:08:23,482
Gosh, it's so sunny.

182
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:25,611
We'll have to say goodbye now.

183
00:08:25,612 --> 00:08:26,713
(What kind of secret date awaits them today?)

184
00:08:28,252 --> 00:08:31,952
(1 day until the final decision, the secret date)

185
00:08:31,953 --> 00:08:37,292
(They can choose up to 2 people for their secret dates.)

186
00:08:37,293 --> 00:08:41,232
(Even if it's not mutual, the date will be set.)

187
00:08:41,362 --> 00:08:43,762
I wanted to spend all of my time with Jae Hyung.

188
00:08:43,902 --> 00:08:46,872
I wanted to talk to Ji Won one last time.

189
00:08:47,073 --> 00:08:50,343
I thought a lot about my second date.

190
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:53,172
I wanted to know...

191
00:08:53,173 --> 00:08:54,912
if he had any concerns or worries after the final decision.

192
00:08:54,913 --> 00:08:57,712
What kind of decision will she make?

193
00:08:57,713 --> 00:09:00,151
I want to know what on earth he's thinking.

194
00:09:00,152 --> 00:09:04,222
I did want to check how she felt about me.

195
00:09:04,453 --> 00:09:06,422
"Did you also think we clicked?"

196
00:09:06,423 --> 00:09:08,293
"What kind of a person should I meet?"

197
00:09:08,453 --> 00:09:10,322
"What kind of a person do I need?"

198
00:09:10,323 --> 00:09:14,563
There were things I felt the need to ask.

199
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:16,433
I'm excited and scared.

200
00:09:16,632 --> 00:09:20,533
If I were to feel something from the secret date,

201
00:09:20,573 --> 00:09:23,173
the result might change.

202
00:09:23,303 --> 00:09:25,972
I also wanted to check how I felt.

203
00:09:26,372 --> 00:09:29,981
It made me think that the only thing left for me to do...

204
00:09:29,982 --> 00:09:31,012
was making my decision.

205
00:09:31,343 --> 00:09:35,351
(With their own reasons and concerns,)

206
00:09:35,352 --> 00:09:39,293
(they head to the locations of their secret dates.)

207
00:09:43,823 --> 00:09:46,231
Then they can go on the date with the person they want...

208
00:09:46,232 --> 00:09:47,433
no matter what.

209
00:09:47,762 --> 00:09:49,262
Actually, it will be more complicated.

210
00:09:49,362 --> 00:09:52,102
It won't be just a fun date then.

211
00:10:04,683 --> 00:10:07,152
(The first secret date)

212
00:10:15,762 --> 00:10:20,163
(Ji Won arrives at the location of the secret date.)

213
00:10:23,533 --> 00:10:25,402
I hope it wasn't Yong Woo.

214
00:10:26,173 --> 00:10:28,703
I didn't want to see him on my first date.

215
00:10:32,073 --> 00:10:35,073
(The guy for Ji Won's secret date is on his way.)

216
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:36,782
- I see. Yesterday... - I thought you made...

217
00:10:36,783 --> 00:10:38,241
a big decision or something.

218
00:10:38,242 --> 00:10:40,012
Yesterday, I texted her...

219
00:10:40,112 --> 00:10:42,621
to thank her for the peaches. It was like...

220
00:10:42,622 --> 00:10:43,823
a farewell message.

221
00:10:44,323 --> 00:10:46,151
- A farewell message. - Like a farewell message.

222
00:10:46,152 --> 00:10:48,521
That's why Cho A asked me what the message meant...

223
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:49,892
yesterday.

224
00:10:50,193 --> 00:10:51,693
I just told her the peaches were tasty.

225
00:10:52,063 --> 00:10:54,632
So it sort of happened like that.

226
00:10:54,963 --> 00:10:56,761
I don't know how this will turn out.

227
00:10:56,762 --> 00:10:58,202
No one really knows.

228
00:10:58,203 --> 00:11:01,002
I'm not sure about Ji Won, to be honest.

229
00:11:01,173 --> 00:11:03,371
The weight of the date might be different.

230
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:04,872
I think Ji Won and I...

231
00:11:05,142 --> 00:11:07,343
might have a more serious conversation.

232
00:11:07,972 --> 00:11:09,543
A lot of things might change.

233
00:11:09,783 --> 00:11:11,183
I'm sort of getting that feeling too.

234
00:11:12,112 --> 00:11:13,252
It's just a feeling, though.

235
00:11:23,522 --> 00:11:25,092
I have a lot of fun memories...

236
00:11:25,093 --> 00:11:27,632
when I was with Ji Won.

237
00:11:27,793 --> 00:11:29,632
I just wanted to see her again.

238
00:11:34,203 --> 00:11:35,472
I was happy to see her.

239
00:11:35,972 --> 00:11:38,202
She was sitting there alone, waiting for me.

240
00:11:38,203 --> 00:11:40,573
There was a time like this once before.

241
00:11:40,772 --> 00:11:43,511
You came to a place that suits you.

242
00:11:43,512 --> 00:11:44,642
Yes. That's right.

243
00:11:46,382 --> 00:11:48,351
How long have you been waiting?

244
00:11:48,352 --> 00:11:49,622
I just got here.

245
00:11:50,423 --> 00:11:52,193
This is my second time walking into a place...

246
00:11:52,453 --> 00:11:53,752
while you're waiting for me.

247
00:11:54,522 --> 00:11:56,522
- You're right. - It's been a while since then.

248
00:11:56,862 --> 00:11:57,892
Right.

249
00:11:58,762 --> 00:12:01,991
(Their first meeting played out similarly to today's date.)

250
00:12:01,992 --> 00:12:03,001
Hello.

251
00:12:03,002 --> 00:12:04,433
Back then, I saw your back first.

252
00:12:05,262 --> 00:12:07,402
But it feels different to see your face first while walking in.

253
00:12:07,573 --> 00:12:09,443
You're right. Totally.

254
00:12:09,573 --> 00:12:11,602
It's been a while. That was our first meeting.

255
00:12:11,742 --> 00:12:15,443
That was our first moment, and this is our last moment.

256
00:12:16,443 --> 00:12:17,482
Right.

257
00:12:22,222 --> 00:12:23,922
- Why aren't you talking? - What?

258
00:12:23,923 --> 00:12:25,722
- In the house... - Yes.

259
00:12:25,852 --> 00:12:28,121
- Did I talk too much in the house? - Are you all talked out?

260
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:30,621
When you were choosing your last date,

261
00:12:30,622 --> 00:12:32,892
what did you have on your mind?

262
00:12:33,193 --> 00:12:34,392
- For today's date? - Yes.

263
00:12:34,992 --> 00:12:36,962
There was a day...

264
00:12:36,963 --> 00:12:38,761
I went through an emotional change.

265
00:12:38,762 --> 00:12:40,372
- Yes. - That was tough on me.

266
00:12:40,732 --> 00:12:43,543
That day, a guy who was wearing his cap backward...

267
00:12:43,772 --> 00:12:45,572
was drinking a lot by himself...

268
00:12:45,573 --> 00:12:47,611
which wasn't like him.

269
00:12:47,612 --> 00:12:49,482
- I see. That was the day. - The bottle was almost empty.

270
00:12:49,612 --> 00:12:51,542
I listened to him, and he told me what happened.

271
00:12:51,543 --> 00:12:53,052
He sent a message to someone else,

272
00:12:53,053 --> 00:12:55,381
not Ju Yeon. So he felt bad about that.

273
00:12:55,382 --> 00:12:56,823
But listening to him...

274
00:12:56,882 --> 00:12:58,953
stirred up something inside me.

275
00:12:59,652 --> 00:13:01,992
I think I did something like that too.

276
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:04,463
- Yes. You did. - So just in case...

277
00:13:05,423 --> 00:13:08,861
(The 2 of them had their 1st date on the day of 1st snow.)

278
00:13:08,862 --> 00:13:10,303
- Clouds like them. - Yes.

279
00:13:10,463 --> 00:13:11,762
- The small ones there. - Yes.

280
00:13:11,963 --> 00:13:17,002
(The two of them spent the entire day together.)

281
00:13:17,573 --> 00:13:19,942
- No, it was fun. - Because it was fun?

282
00:13:19,943 --> 00:13:23,783
(Ji Won sent the message to Yong Woo.)

283
00:13:24,683 --> 00:13:29,583
(Yong Woo didn't send the message to Ji Won.)

284
00:13:31,022 --> 00:13:32,852
I wanted to talk about that today.

285
00:13:33,722 --> 00:13:36,122
I do think that you still had fun...

286
00:13:36,392 --> 00:13:38,962
on our date that day.

287
00:13:38,963 --> 00:13:41,991
But when you didn't text me back,

288
00:13:41,992 --> 00:13:45,432
I thought, "I see. There must be someone he really likes..."

289
00:13:45,433 --> 00:13:48,472
"and is certain about." That crossed my mind.

290
00:13:48,632 --> 00:13:50,271
I guess I wanted to give her...

291
00:13:50,272 --> 00:13:52,512
a sense of certainty and stability.

292
00:13:52,913 --> 00:13:55,742
I think that's why I did it.

293
00:13:57,112 --> 00:13:58,713
But that was like you.

294
00:14:00,053 --> 00:14:03,382
Was it 3 or 4 days ago? Here's how I felt.

295
00:14:03,652 --> 00:14:06,222
We spent a few days consecutively.

296
00:14:06,593 --> 00:14:08,053
I saw different sides of her.

297
00:14:09,622 --> 00:14:11,663
I learned that she was a great person.

298
00:14:12,022 --> 00:14:15,932
But I wanted to have a relationship that I would enjoy...

299
00:14:15,933 --> 00:14:18,862
with someone I was romantically attracted to.

300
00:14:19,073 --> 00:14:21,433
I was conflicted regarding that.

301
00:14:21,602 --> 00:14:23,741
Considering my actions so far...

302
00:14:23,742 --> 00:14:26,471
and my one-sided expectations of her,

303
00:14:26,472 --> 00:14:28,073
I became conflicted.

304
00:14:28,443 --> 00:14:30,481
You said you were looking for someone...

305
00:14:30,482 --> 00:14:34,112
you were romantically attracted to. Was there someone like that here?

306
00:14:34,213 --> 00:14:37,022
It might sound foolish. But I thought there shouldn't be.

307
00:14:37,382 --> 00:14:41,122
Being attracted to someone else didn't seem right.

308
00:14:41,693 --> 00:14:44,422
It was either her or no one.

309
00:14:44,423 --> 00:14:46,262
That's how I must have thought.

310
00:14:47,163 --> 00:14:48,491
But who knows?

311
00:14:48,492 --> 00:14:50,832
I might have put myself in a box with these thoughts.

312
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:53,333
Two days ago, I decided to be neutral.

313
00:14:53,433 --> 00:14:56,303
Ever since then, I started to notice other things.

314
00:14:56,602 --> 00:14:58,971
Among those things, what I noticed the most was...

315
00:14:58,972 --> 00:15:01,242
the guy who was drinking soju alone with his cap backward.

316
00:15:03,913 --> 00:15:05,981
And his sister showed me some different sides of her...

317
00:15:05,982 --> 00:15:08,553
- which I didn't see before. - I see. Her.

318
00:15:08,652 --> 00:15:10,481
Isn't he talking about Ji Won?

319
00:15:10,482 --> 00:15:11,922
Right. His sister. Ji Won.

320
00:15:11,923 --> 00:15:13,391
It's difficult to understand him...

321
00:15:13,392 --> 00:15:14,851
- with all these indirect comments. - He's...

322
00:15:14,852 --> 00:15:16,462
Well, I get what he's saying.

323
00:15:16,463 --> 00:15:18,522
He must think that way of talking is witty.

324
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:20,731
Right. He must think...

325
00:15:20,732 --> 00:15:22,663
- that's his humorous charm. - Right.

326
00:15:22,933 --> 00:15:25,333
It was the guy who was drinking soju alone with his cap backward.

327
00:15:28,002 --> 00:15:30,042
And his sister showed me some different sides of her...

328
00:15:30,043 --> 00:15:32,612
- which I didn't see before. - I see. Her.

329
00:15:32,742 --> 00:15:33,971
I realized that I only saw 20 percent of her,

330
00:15:33,972 --> 00:15:35,213
and I missed 80 percent of her.

331
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:38,283
She was someone I had fun with.

332
00:15:38,913 --> 00:15:41,382
I wasn't at ease around her, but I had the most fun...

333
00:15:41,713 --> 00:15:43,482
with her in a way.

334
00:15:43,652 --> 00:15:45,922
Sometimes, we talk about superficial things.

335
00:15:45,923 --> 00:15:48,192
And other times, we talk about things from the heart.

336
00:15:48,193 --> 00:15:51,861
When we could just talk from the heart without much effort,

337
00:15:51,862 --> 00:15:54,362
I thought you were quite intriguing.

338
00:15:55,293 --> 00:15:58,632
Should I say our codes are the same? Like we're on the same wavelength.

339
00:15:59,232 --> 00:16:01,033
How do you feel? Our decision is tomorrow.

340
00:16:01,472 --> 00:16:02,672
(Sighing)

341
00:16:02,673 --> 00:16:05,502
- Actually, I... - Yes.

342
00:16:06,872 --> 00:16:08,272
Is that sound coming from your heart?

343
00:16:10,813 --> 00:16:12,682
I didn't know...

344
00:16:12,683 --> 00:16:14,912
I would be this conflicted...

345
00:16:14,913 --> 00:16:18,652
when we only have our last date left.

346
00:16:18,882 --> 00:16:19,891
Actually, I thought...

347
00:16:19,892 --> 00:16:21,292
- you had everything figured out. - Really?

348
00:16:21,293 --> 00:16:23,522
I doubt I'm the only one who thought so.

349
00:16:23,823 --> 00:16:24,862
- Really? - Yes.

350
00:16:25,163 --> 00:16:27,992
I thought the newlyweds in Singapore were already decided.

351
00:16:28,392 --> 00:16:29,563
- Is that so? - Yes.

352
00:16:29,703 --> 00:16:33,732
I started to feel conflicted since two days ago or yesterday.

353
00:16:33,902 --> 00:16:34,933
Is there a reason?

354
00:16:35,033 --> 00:16:36,902
- I was just following my old habit. - I see.

355
00:16:38,272 --> 00:16:42,011
Then there was a moment I had a realization.

356
00:16:42,012 --> 00:16:43,413
- You did? - Yes.

357
00:16:43,882 --> 00:16:44,943
"I'm doing this again."

358
00:16:44,982 --> 00:16:46,052
What kind of old habit was it?

359
00:16:46,053 --> 00:16:48,982
Instead of dating someone I could rely on,

360
00:16:49,152 --> 00:16:52,621
I used to date men who could give me...

361
00:16:52,622 --> 00:16:56,192
a sense of escape from the reality briefly.

362
00:16:56,462 --> 00:16:59,533
But in those relationships, I always felt...

363
00:16:59,763 --> 00:17:01,332
a puzzling sense of emptiness.

364
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:03,461
Because your worlds couldn't be combined.

365
00:17:03,462 --> 00:17:06,601
The Kim Ji Won here...

366
00:17:06,602 --> 00:17:07,872
couldn't go there.

367
00:17:08,632 --> 00:17:11,642
But now, I want someone I can rely on...

368
00:17:11,803 --> 00:17:14,242
and lean on with everything.

369
00:17:14,243 --> 00:17:18,642
I came here with the purpose of finding someone...

370
00:17:19,182 --> 00:17:21,983
whom I could share my life with.

371
00:17:22,212 --> 00:17:26,451
I did want to make a different decision.

372
00:17:26,452 --> 00:17:28,652
But Jae Hyung is...

373
00:17:29,323 --> 00:17:32,162
closer to the guys I used to date.

374
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:33,962
Things are so natural with him.

375
00:17:34,293 --> 00:17:36,702
When I'm with him, he makes me laugh.

376
00:17:37,003 --> 00:17:38,702
I feel at ease too around him.

377
00:17:39,602 --> 00:17:42,401
So I spent time with Jae Hyung because it felt natural.

378
00:17:42,402 --> 00:17:44,272
But when we had our date yesterday...

379
00:17:44,273 --> 00:17:45,641
I was the one he talked to the most.

380
00:17:45,642 --> 00:17:48,073
But I felt as if I was the one who knew the least about him.

381
00:17:48,343 --> 00:17:50,313
- About Jae Hyung? Yes. - About Jae Hyung.

382
00:17:50,743 --> 00:17:52,611
I suddenly realized this yesterday.

383
00:17:52,612 --> 00:17:56,523
I felt a sense of emptiness.

384
00:17:56,622 --> 00:18:00,222
It made me think that I was making the same decision...

385
00:18:00,223 --> 00:18:03,723
like I was following my old habit. That crossed my mind.

386
00:18:04,122 --> 00:18:06,362
I just thought you two were getting along well here.

387
00:18:07,263 --> 00:18:09,662
I didn't know you were looking for that in a guy.

388
00:18:10,362 --> 00:18:11,702
From what I observed,

389
00:18:11,902 --> 00:18:13,431
you're really good at what you do,

390
00:18:13,432 --> 00:18:15,431
so you might not need any help.

391
00:18:15,432 --> 00:18:18,303
I saw how strong you were.

392
00:18:18,843 --> 00:18:22,612
That was the only moment I hesitated on this show.

393
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:24,843
And the cause of my hesitation...

394
00:18:28,112 --> 00:18:30,182
was because we were so similar, that we might fight a lot.

395
00:18:31,852 --> 00:18:33,122
It's like...

396
00:18:34,122 --> 00:18:36,622
How should I say? We might fight. You know?

397
00:18:36,823 --> 00:18:40,533
I could see how we might end up fighting.

398
00:18:41,462 --> 00:18:44,833
So I told myself that it might not be the case.

399
00:18:45,132 --> 00:18:48,632
I hesitated once then. But I just texted her out of habit.

400
00:18:49,573 --> 00:18:51,773
(The first day he met Ji Won)

401
00:18:51,973 --> 00:18:55,842
(For the first time, he had to think about whom he should text.)

402
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,612
(Ji Won...)

403
00:18:59,112 --> 00:19:02,351
(He sent the message to Cho A after thinking for some time.)

404
00:19:02,352 --> 00:19:04,252
Do you remember what I said on our first date?

405
00:19:04,253 --> 00:19:07,293
I said I felt comfortable, yet uncomfortable around you.

406
00:19:07,493 --> 00:19:08,552
(I think we're the same age.)

407
00:19:08,553 --> 00:19:09,593
(You think so?)

408
00:19:10,122 --> 00:19:12,563
(It's neither comfortable nor uncomfortable around you.)

409
00:19:13,192 --> 00:19:15,063
(That's how people around the same age feel.)

410
00:19:15,662 --> 00:19:17,262
(And I felt comfortable.)

411
00:19:17,263 --> 00:19:19,333
(But it wasn't entirely comfortable.)

412
00:19:19,902 --> 00:19:21,172
(It wasn't entirely comfortable?)

413
00:19:21,672 --> 00:19:24,671
I mean, if you think about their date on Jebu Island...

414
00:19:24,672 --> 00:19:26,313
and the mood between them,

415
00:19:26,743 --> 00:19:27,872
it wasn't awkward.

416
00:19:28,073 --> 00:19:30,181
He wasn't supposed to text someone else...

417
00:19:30,182 --> 00:19:32,313
given the chemistry they had.

418
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:35,682
He's such a fool.

419
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:38,852
- I think he was just confused. - You can't understand him, right?

420
00:19:39,622 --> 00:19:42,351
But when we lived in the house together,

421
00:19:42,352 --> 00:19:45,191
we teased each other a lot.

422
00:19:45,192 --> 00:19:47,691
I was quite comfortable around you.

423
00:19:47,692 --> 00:19:49,763
But now that we're on a date,

424
00:19:53,172 --> 00:19:55,431
I don't know why I feel uncomfortable.

425
00:19:55,432 --> 00:19:58,371
When I look at you, there's a side of me...

426
00:19:58,372 --> 00:20:00,572
that wants to avoid facing you.

427
00:20:00,573 --> 00:20:02,411
- Is that so? - I wonder if it's because...

428
00:20:02,412 --> 00:20:04,282
you and I are so much alike.

429
00:20:04,283 --> 00:20:06,181
I wonder if that's why. Or it could be...

430
00:20:06,182 --> 00:20:08,313
because I had never relied on anyone.

431
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:12,023
So maybe I feel awkward and want to avoid facing you...

432
00:20:12,182 --> 00:20:14,592
because that new side of me might come out.

433
00:20:14,593 --> 00:20:18,362
Subconsciously, I thought that he and I were similar.

434
00:20:18,563 --> 00:20:20,832
I tend to work really hard...

435
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:22,803
and pretend to be stronger...

436
00:20:23,033 --> 00:20:25,233
than I am deep down.

437
00:20:25,402 --> 00:20:27,802
But he might be able...

438
00:20:27,803 --> 00:20:29,172
to see right through me.

439
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,073
So it scared me.

440
00:20:31,243 --> 00:20:34,371
Yong Woo and I had a similar childhood.

441
00:20:34,372 --> 00:20:36,181
Because of our similar backgrounds,

442
00:20:36,182 --> 00:20:39,313
I might have felt this way about him.

443
00:20:39,952 --> 00:20:45,283
(The day they watched a video from Yong Woo's childhood)

444
00:20:47,392 --> 00:20:52,562
(I saw Yong Woo's video when he was an adolescent.)

445
00:20:52,563 --> 00:20:56,431
(It seems he's not smiling as often as before.)

446
00:20:56,432 --> 00:20:59,262
(So that broke my heart a bit.)

447
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,901
(Ever since I was a kid,)

448
00:21:00,902 --> 00:21:05,371
(I had this idea that I had to be independent and live my own life.)

449
00:21:05,372 --> 00:21:08,342
(Should I say it was a will? Or an obsession?)

450
00:21:08,343 --> 00:21:14,253
(She saw herself in Young Yong Woo.)

451
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:17,482
(He was young too.)

452
00:21:17,483 --> 00:21:20,121
(That young boy had to face responsibility...)

453
00:21:20,122 --> 00:21:22,762
(he didn't intend to take on.)

454
00:21:22,763 --> 00:21:28,732
(Trying to overcome that responsibility on his own...)

455
00:21:28,733 --> 00:21:30,431
(made me feel bad for him.)

456
00:21:30,432 --> 00:21:34,302
(So when I observed his interaction with others in the house,)

457
00:21:34,303 --> 00:21:38,272
(I often saw the remnants of the young boy.)

458
00:21:38,273 --> 00:21:40,342
(Actually, I cry a lot too.)

459
00:21:40,343 --> 00:21:43,442
(I felt that he and I were similar in that sense.)

460
00:21:43,912 --> 00:21:47,582
(Acting tough in front of the others makes us very similar people.)

461
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:51,951
We watched our childhood videos when we were in Gangwon Province.

462
00:21:51,952 --> 00:21:53,351
I liked that we did...

463
00:21:53,352 --> 00:21:55,522
because I thought...

464
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:59,762
it was okay to show my weak side to other people.

465
00:21:59,763 --> 00:22:01,292
That crossed my mind...

466
00:22:01,293 --> 00:22:03,563
Actually, that was the second time...

467
00:22:03,932 --> 00:22:06,033
that you and I were similar.

468
00:22:06,902 --> 00:22:09,502
(Yong Woo watched Ji Won's childhood video.)

469
00:22:09,503 --> 00:22:10,972
(Ji Won and I...)

470
00:22:10,973 --> 00:22:13,472
(tend to think quite similarly.)

471
00:22:13,473 --> 00:22:15,342
(It's like my alter ego...)

472
00:22:15,343 --> 00:22:18,941
(of the opposite gender is in Ji Won or something.)

473
00:22:18,942 --> 00:22:21,252
(I think she and I tackle hardships...)

474
00:22:21,253 --> 00:22:22,752
(and difficulties in the same way.)

475
00:22:22,753 --> 00:22:24,421
(I get the feeling that...)

476
00:22:24,422 --> 00:22:26,052
(deep down, she's a strong individual.)

477
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,822
(But she doesn't show it.)

478
00:22:27,823 --> 00:22:30,222
(I thought she and I were similar in that sense.)

479
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:32,562
(What stood out from her video was...)

480
00:22:32,563 --> 00:22:35,461
(that she must have been lonely since childhood.)

481
00:22:35,462 --> 00:22:37,401
(I could see that she grew up with high expectations...)

482
00:22:37,402 --> 00:22:39,871
(and she must have felt a lot of pressure because of that.)

483
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,931
(Then I also thought she might not have felt lonely...)

484
00:22:41,932 --> 00:22:44,072
(while accomplishing her goals...)

485
00:22:44,073 --> 00:22:46,611
(because no one taught her about that.)

486
00:22:46,612 --> 00:22:48,342
(When I noticed these things,)

487
00:22:48,343 --> 00:22:50,012
(I could sympathize with her,)

488
00:22:50,013 --> 00:22:51,711
(but at the same time, I pushed her away.)

489
00:22:51,712 --> 00:22:54,181
(I experienced such feelings when that wasn't my intention.)

490
00:22:54,182 --> 00:22:57,022
(I did have a subtle feeling of that when we were on the date.)

491
00:22:57,023 --> 00:22:58,582
(I think a lot on my own.)

492
00:22:58,583 --> 00:23:00,322
(Even when I lie down to go to sleep,)

493
00:23:00,323 --> 00:23:02,151
(I think about, "What did I do today?")

494
00:23:02,152 --> 00:23:04,622
("Would it have been better if I did this?")

495
00:23:04,892 --> 00:23:06,492
("What should I do tomorrow?")

496
00:23:06,493 --> 00:23:08,461
(We're very similar in that sense.)

497
00:23:08,462 --> 00:23:10,002
(How would you describe yourself?)

498
00:23:10,003 --> 00:23:12,431
(When it comes to expressing emotions,)

499
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:14,832
(I'm quite blunt.)

500
00:23:14,833 --> 00:23:17,002
(And when I say things I don't mean...)

501
00:23:17,003 --> 00:23:18,003
(Is it obvious?)

502
00:23:18,003 --> 00:23:19,003
(it's very obvious.)

503
00:23:19,004 --> 00:23:20,542
(You say that now, but I get the feeling...)

504
00:23:20,543 --> 00:23:22,072
(you end up doing something totally unexpected.)

505
00:23:22,073 --> 00:23:24,141
(That's correct. I do.)

506
00:23:24,142 --> 00:23:29,922
(I think about it, but in the end, I just follow my heart.)

507
00:23:30,783 --> 00:23:34,552
(So in the end, thinking about it is pointless.)

508
00:23:34,553 --> 00:23:35,593
I see. It's pointless.

509
00:23:35,692 --> 00:23:38,563
- Should I say it was scary? - Yes.

510
00:23:38,723 --> 00:23:39,763
I had never felt it before.

511
00:23:40,263 --> 00:23:42,493
I felt scared for the first time.

512
00:23:43,233 --> 00:23:45,632
Just like you, I had to be independent since I was a kid.

513
00:23:45,902 --> 00:23:47,772
- I was proud of that. - Right.

514
00:23:47,773 --> 00:23:51,042
I became used to doing things on my own. And I became good at it.

515
00:23:51,043 --> 00:23:54,742
So out of habit, I became more independent...

516
00:23:54,743 --> 00:23:55,812
- and so on. - Right.

517
00:23:55,813 --> 00:23:56,912
But I don't hate that about myself...

518
00:23:57,013 --> 00:24:00,152
because I think that helped me a lot in life.

519
00:24:00,212 --> 00:24:03,152
Right. When I was growing up, it was a bit tough.

520
00:24:03,382 --> 00:24:05,752
Even now, I think that's a good quality of mine.

521
00:24:05,753 --> 00:24:07,253
It's a good quality to have in life.

522
00:24:07,593 --> 00:24:11,523
I'm discovering many new sides of me here.

523
00:24:12,293 --> 00:24:13,762
Both of us are pretending...

524
00:24:13,763 --> 00:24:15,233
- to be the thinking type. - Yes.

525
00:24:15,793 --> 00:24:18,332
- But inside, we're... - Feelers, disguised as thinkers.

526
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:19,502
softhearted kids.

527
00:24:19,503 --> 00:24:21,073
I see a crying kid.

528
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:23,871
Yes. This is it.

529
00:24:23,872 --> 00:24:26,542
Watching these videos can't make a huge difference.

530
00:24:26,543 --> 00:24:28,842
These videos can make someone look impressive and all.

531
00:24:28,843 --> 00:24:31,211
- But people leave it at that. - Right.

532
00:24:31,212 --> 00:24:32,542
They think that way...

533
00:24:32,543 --> 00:24:33,851
- because they like each other. - Right. Finding reasons...

534
00:24:33,852 --> 00:24:35,482
They think they're similar because they like each other.

535
00:24:35,483 --> 00:24:36,782
- Right. - They keep trying to connect...

536
00:24:36,783 --> 00:24:38,082
- themselves with each other. - Yes.

537
00:24:38,083 --> 00:24:39,852
- Right. - You're right.

538
00:24:40,223 --> 00:24:42,961
It might be something we can't pick up on.

539
00:24:42,962 --> 00:24:45,493
They must have felt a similar feeling.

540
00:24:46,063 --> 00:24:48,362
They must have had a connection only they felt.

541
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:50,833
I've been feeling weird since this morning.

542
00:24:51,402 --> 00:24:54,003
"Will I get to see Ji Won?"

543
00:24:54,733 --> 00:24:56,901
- "I should keep our meeting short." - Keep it short?

544
00:24:56,902 --> 00:24:58,073
That crossed my mind...

545
00:24:58,243 --> 00:24:59,543
because if I were to see you,

546
00:24:59,672 --> 00:25:02,472
I was afraid that my position might change.

547
00:25:02,473 --> 00:25:04,742
I was sort of concerned about this possibility...

548
00:25:04,743 --> 00:25:06,352
which was quite odd.

549
00:25:14,293 --> 00:25:15,951
When I had to pick two people yesterday,

550
00:25:15,952 --> 00:25:17,662
I gave it a lot of thought.

551
00:25:17,922 --> 00:25:19,763
I had a lot on my mind.

552
00:25:20,063 --> 00:25:23,562
Among the choices, you were one of them.

553
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:27,003
One of the big reasons behind picking you was...

554
00:25:27,073 --> 00:25:29,033
because you were the type of person I would like to date.

555
00:25:29,303 --> 00:25:34,472
Given the intention I had before joining the show,

556
00:25:34,473 --> 00:25:36,382
you were the closest to the type I was looking for.

557
00:25:37,942 --> 00:25:39,983
- So... - I had no idea.

558
00:25:40,412 --> 00:25:42,651
- Not at all? - Not a clue.

559
00:25:42,652 --> 00:25:45,121
Even if your feelings and my feelings...

560
00:25:45,122 --> 00:25:47,922
weren't reciprocated after this,

561
00:25:47,993 --> 00:25:51,391
I thought reminding myself of my intention...

562
00:25:51,392 --> 00:25:53,132
would give me a chance...

563
00:25:53,233 --> 00:25:55,832
to realize more things.

564
00:25:55,833 --> 00:25:58,263
I chose to see you today with that in mind.

565
00:25:58,503 --> 00:26:01,702
I thought what she said was really brave.

566
00:26:01,803 --> 00:26:05,273
I realized that I didn't think much...

567
00:26:05,543 --> 00:26:08,473
of what other people thought of me.

568
00:26:08,573 --> 00:26:11,313
So I probably didn't experience what she went through.

569
00:26:11,483 --> 00:26:14,452
I saw that it was possible that Ji Won couldn't express herself.

570
00:26:14,682 --> 00:26:16,583
It felt as if an obstacle that was blocking my heart...

571
00:26:16,652 --> 00:26:18,223
was removed.

572
00:26:18,723 --> 00:26:21,552
For the past 3 or 4 days, I didn't want...

573
00:26:21,553 --> 00:26:23,093
to text anyone.

574
00:26:24,922 --> 00:26:28,733
But I realized something from unexpected moments.

575
00:26:28,793 --> 00:26:30,033
So I might not feel the same way now.

576
00:26:32,033 --> 00:26:35,773
To be honest, I felt this way for the first time...

577
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,803
here.

578
00:26:40,112 --> 00:26:42,342
I expected that there would be...

579
00:26:42,343 --> 00:26:45,682
a big rock along this journey.

580
00:26:46,783 --> 00:26:48,483
I think this is the moment.

581
00:26:48,652 --> 00:26:51,053
Even before moving into the house,

582
00:26:51,223 --> 00:26:53,652
I was curious about what I would do.

583
00:26:54,053 --> 00:26:56,892
Will I accept who I have been?

584
00:26:57,323 --> 00:27:00,763
Or will I make a different decision?

585
00:27:01,462 --> 00:27:04,503
It feels as if that rock was right in front of me.

586
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:06,932
I think my rock has been moved.

587
00:27:09,473 --> 00:27:10,942
To be honest, I don't believe in fate.

588
00:27:11,402 --> 00:27:12,602
But I want to believe...

589
00:27:14,412 --> 00:27:15,442
in fate this time.

590
00:27:19,313 --> 00:27:20,352
They said, "Sure."

591
00:27:20,583 --> 00:27:21,753
What an interesting timing.

592
00:27:23,223 --> 00:27:24,253
This is so funny.

593
00:27:24,852 --> 00:27:26,523
Listening to birds chirping brings good fortune.

594
00:27:26,692 --> 00:27:27,823
- Is that so? - Yes.

595
00:27:28,793 --> 00:27:32,121
I think it must have been harder on you than me.

596
00:27:32,122 --> 00:27:37,503
Despite that, you tried to talk to me about your thoughts.

597
00:27:38,063 --> 00:27:39,202
Thank you.

598
00:27:43,672 --> 00:27:46,813
Actually, I felt liberated.

599
00:27:47,313 --> 00:27:49,172
I had a sense of liberation.

600
00:27:49,442 --> 00:27:52,243
It was really comfortable to be with her.

601
00:27:53,152 --> 00:27:55,612
"I see. Yes, this is it." That's what I thought.

602
00:27:56,983 --> 00:27:58,351
Yes. I thought that to myself.

603
00:27:58,352 --> 00:28:00,921
I realized that Ji Won had that kind of energy on me...

604
00:28:00,922 --> 00:28:03,763
and amazing power on me. I sensed that.

605
00:28:03,922 --> 00:28:08,493
I felt that all these good feelings I had about Ji Won...

606
00:28:09,362 --> 00:28:10,763
weren't wrong.

607
00:28:11,063 --> 00:28:14,072
As for my curiosity about Ji Won...

608
00:28:14,073 --> 00:28:15,802
and our similar qualities,

609
00:28:15,803 --> 00:28:19,401
I think I might have tried to dismiss them on purpose.

610
00:28:19,402 --> 00:28:21,343
I'm comfortable, yet uncomfortable around her.

611
00:28:21,642 --> 00:28:25,342
I feel at ease with her because we see eye to eye when we talk.

612
00:28:25,343 --> 00:28:26,412
But she makes me uneasy...

613
00:28:28,212 --> 00:28:29,381
I'm not sure.

614
00:28:29,382 --> 00:28:31,682
Maybe it's because I feel romantically attracted to her.

615
00:28:32,223 --> 00:28:34,422
That might have been why.

616
00:28:35,053 --> 00:28:39,093
Out of all the dates I had been on for the past three weeks,

617
00:28:39,263 --> 00:28:41,191
this date was meaningful to me...

618
00:28:41,192 --> 00:28:42,763
because it gave me a sense of liberation.

619
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:47,172
I wonder if we have to talk to a lot more people after this.

620
00:28:47,432 --> 00:28:48,432
I wonder about that too.

621
00:28:49,333 --> 00:28:51,743
But for me, the conversations...

622
00:28:51,872 --> 00:28:54,012
I have after this would go into...

623
00:28:54,013 --> 00:28:55,543
a different category.

624
00:28:56,043 --> 00:28:57,542
Could I ask you...

625
00:28:57,543 --> 00:29:00,111
- what the theme of your outfit is? - Oh, this?

626
00:29:00,112 --> 00:29:01,682
To be honest, I thought it was a net.

627
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:05,651
- "Is she going fishing today?" - You're annoying.

628
00:29:05,652 --> 00:29:06,723
You caught a big one.

629
00:29:08,093 --> 00:29:09,152
So annoying.

630
00:29:09,852 --> 00:29:13,891
(Ji Won and Yong Woo's secret date is over.)

631
00:29:13,892 --> 00:29:15,033
- I'll get going now. - Okay.

632
00:29:17,602 --> 00:29:19,763
I think I had a change of heart...

633
00:29:20,202 --> 00:29:21,602
toward Ji Won.

634
00:29:22,003 --> 00:29:25,371
To be honest, Jae Hyung and Ji Won...

635
00:29:25,372 --> 00:29:27,671
seemed to be getting along well.

636
00:29:27,672 --> 00:29:30,043
Given what was going on with me and thinking that they were happy,

637
00:29:30,382 --> 00:29:32,343
I didn't think I should express my interest.

638
00:29:32,483 --> 00:29:34,452
But after talking to Ji Won today,

639
00:29:34,813 --> 00:29:37,181
I got to learn more about what she was thinking.

640
00:29:37,182 --> 00:29:39,323
So now, my heart is pointing to her now.

641
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:41,793
Gosh. I think I'm in big trouble.

642
00:29:41,852 --> 00:29:44,262
He had the exact same thought.

643
00:29:44,263 --> 00:29:49,192
- In what ways? - Both of us... It was like...

644
00:29:50,233 --> 00:29:52,401
Naturally, I was attracted...

645
00:29:52,402 --> 00:29:56,102
to someone I was familiar with.

646
00:29:56,402 --> 00:29:59,773
I didn't know I would still be uncertain until the last day.

647
00:30:01,013 --> 00:30:02,112
- Is she having second thoughts? - What?

648
00:30:02,773 --> 00:30:04,641
- No. She's being honest. - Gosh.

649
00:30:04,642 --> 00:30:06,312
Is it this easy for people to have second thoughts?

650
00:30:06,313 --> 00:30:09,012
Yong Woo is an attractive guy.

651
00:30:09,013 --> 00:30:10,121
- Right. - When he said...

652
00:30:10,122 --> 00:30:11,222
his position was neutral,

653
00:30:11,223 --> 00:30:12,522
it stirred them up.

654
00:30:12,523 --> 00:30:14,593
- Right. - By the way,

655
00:30:14,753 --> 00:30:16,992
- they seem to click when they talk. - They make a good couple. Right.

656
00:30:16,993 --> 00:30:18,262
- It's a pity... - Yes, they do.

657
00:30:18,263 --> 00:30:19,492
that they had this talk toward the end.

658
00:30:19,493 --> 00:30:20,631
- I don't get it. - On top of that,

659
00:30:20,632 --> 00:30:23,192
they had been interested in each other the whole time.

660
00:30:23,263 --> 00:30:24,303
It was mutual.

661
00:30:24,632 --> 00:30:26,732
They just couldn't express it.

662
00:30:26,733 --> 00:30:28,402
- They saw eye to eye. - They did.

663
00:30:30,243 --> 00:30:33,202
(Wheeler's Tropikana)

664
00:30:44,182 --> 00:30:47,892
(Se Seung arrives at the location of her secret date first.)

665
00:30:55,932 --> 00:30:58,132
(Who did you pick for your date?)

666
00:30:58,533 --> 00:30:59,632
Jung Sub.

667
00:30:59,803 --> 00:31:02,232
We have to make our final decision soon.

668
00:31:02,233 --> 00:31:05,701
Now that we're somewhat aware of our directions,

669
00:31:05,702 --> 00:31:08,973
I wanted to talk about what would come after this.

670
00:31:09,073 --> 00:31:12,482
I didn't have anyone I wanted to talk...

671
00:31:12,483 --> 00:31:15,313
to secretly by going on this secret date.

672
00:31:15,352 --> 00:31:18,023
I didn't want to cause another understanding either.

673
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:25,763
(She's waiting for Jung Sub.)

674
00:31:39,843 --> 00:31:42,612
(Someone is coming.)

675
00:31:43,212 --> 00:31:45,142
- What? Yong Woo is busy. - Yong Woo?

676
00:31:53,223 --> 00:31:55,952
(Someone is coming.)

677
00:31:56,323 --> 00:31:58,563
- What? Yong Woo is busy. - Yong Woo?

678
00:31:58,862 --> 00:32:00,461
- He's so busy. - Yong Woo.

679
00:32:00,462 --> 00:32:01,592
- That's Yong Woo? - "Yong Woo is busy."

680
00:32:01,593 --> 00:32:04,132
- He's everywhere. - What on earth...

681
00:32:04,162 --> 00:32:06,102
- Yong Woo... - He keeps carrying that doctor bag.

682
00:32:06,202 --> 00:32:09,273
Is he making house calls with the girls?

683
00:32:09,333 --> 00:32:11,201
What's he doing?

684
00:32:11,202 --> 00:32:12,242
The doctor bag.

685
00:32:12,243 --> 00:32:14,042
- Gosh, Dr. Yong. - I was surprised.

686
00:32:14,043 --> 00:32:16,171
I wonder what's in his bag.

687
00:32:16,172 --> 00:32:17,482
- Why is he carrying that? - Hey.

688
00:32:17,483 --> 00:32:18,711
You know what's in his bag?

689
00:32:18,712 --> 00:32:20,612
- His charms are in it. - Right.

690
00:32:21,783 --> 00:32:23,983
- A book with romantic lines. - A book with romantic lines.

691
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:40,202
- Hello. - Hi.

692
00:32:40,902 --> 00:32:43,303
- Hi. - Hi. H-I.

693
00:32:43,573 --> 00:32:45,142
- H-I. - Hi.

694
00:32:45,303 --> 00:32:47,013
- What's this? - What's this?

695
00:32:47,543 --> 00:32:49,172
"What's he doing here?"

696
00:32:50,073 --> 00:32:51,412
Seeing him there was so random.

697
00:32:52,313 --> 00:32:55,753
I was so surprised. For a second, I was confused.

698
00:32:55,852 --> 00:32:58,882
Then I hid my surprise and tried to look happy to see him.

699
00:33:00,852 --> 00:33:02,052
- Hello. - Hi.

700
00:33:02,053 --> 00:33:04,822
- Hi. - It rained a lot.

701
00:33:04,823 --> 00:33:05,891
Right.

702
00:33:05,892 --> 00:33:06,961
Hello.

703
00:33:06,962 --> 00:33:08,263
Hello.

704
00:33:08,362 --> 00:33:10,232
It's raining a lot.

705
00:33:10,233 --> 00:33:12,032
The weather is so capricious.

706
00:33:12,033 --> 00:33:14,733
Nothing is unexpected in Singapore.

707
00:33:15,402 --> 00:33:17,902
- How fickle. - How fickle.

708
00:33:18,773 --> 00:33:20,743
Well, actually,

709
00:33:21,073 --> 00:33:22,512
I wanted us to talk comfortably,

710
00:33:22,513 --> 00:33:23,543
and there was something I wanted to tell you.

711
00:33:24,382 --> 00:33:27,312
I had a chance to talk to Yun Jae.

712
00:33:27,313 --> 00:33:30,583
Ju Yeon had a great time with Yun Jae on the date.

713
00:33:30,652 --> 00:33:32,482
That night,

714
00:33:32,483 --> 00:33:35,421
he didn't text Ju Yeon. So he felt awful about that.

715
00:33:35,422 --> 00:33:37,621
- I get what you're trying to say. - You do?

716
00:33:37,622 --> 00:33:41,392
I did the same thing to another lady.

717
00:33:42,962 --> 00:33:44,033
I wanted to apologize.

718
00:33:45,263 --> 00:33:46,361
That looks beautiful.

719
00:33:46,362 --> 00:33:49,273
(They went on the 2-day trip to Gangwon Province.)

720
00:33:51,503 --> 00:33:52,773
Our poop heads should touch.

721
00:33:54,243 --> 00:33:55,543
It's getting really warm.

722
00:33:56,043 --> 00:33:59,212
(That night, she sent the message to Yong Woo.)

723
00:34:01,152 --> 00:34:04,882
(But she didn't get a message from him.)

724
00:34:05,482 --> 00:34:09,052
I didn't send it to you because I hated you or anything.

725
00:34:09,053 --> 00:34:11,322
- I know that. - That's all.

726
00:34:11,323 --> 00:34:14,961
Well, let me tell you how I felt about that.

727
00:34:14,962 --> 00:34:18,061
Actually, what you did was pretty cool.

728
00:34:18,062 --> 00:34:20,802
- "That's what I should be doing." - Really?

729
00:34:20,803 --> 00:34:22,032
- I felt that. - I see. Really?

730
00:34:22,033 --> 00:34:26,742
Your decision gave me a big realization to me.

731
00:34:26,743 --> 00:34:28,941
- Really? - Yes. I thought it was cool.

732
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:29,973
- That's fascinating. - Yes.

733
00:34:30,143 --> 00:34:32,542
- So you don't have to feel bad. - Okay.

734
00:34:34,353 --> 00:34:36,513
- I see. - Yes. I thought it'd be nice...

735
00:34:36,922 --> 00:34:38,122
to tell you how I felt.

736
00:34:38,123 --> 00:34:39,123
And...

737
00:34:39,482 --> 00:34:41,421
I was also curious about how you had been doing.

738
00:34:41,422 --> 00:34:42,553
Actually, I felt as if...

739
00:34:43,053 --> 00:34:44,422
I was at a secluded area.

740
00:34:44,792 --> 00:34:46,933
I didn't know what other people were going through.

741
00:34:47,493 --> 00:34:48,932
Even when we lived in the same house,

742
00:34:48,933 --> 00:34:50,763
I didn't pay attention to other people's dates.

743
00:34:51,163 --> 00:34:52,861
It's true that I don't pay attention to other people.

744
00:34:52,862 --> 00:34:54,132
But it was true that I was in the dark.

745
00:34:54,303 --> 00:34:56,203
But lately, I started to pick up on a few things.

746
00:34:56,703 --> 00:34:58,502
I was wondering how you had been doing.

747
00:34:58,573 --> 00:35:00,941
Then I was naturally curious about Jae Hyung too.

748
00:35:00,942 --> 00:35:02,671
Jae Hyung and I had been close...

749
00:35:02,672 --> 00:35:04,412
- during the first two weeks. - Right.

750
00:35:04,413 --> 00:35:06,243
But we were on different floors in Singapore.

751
00:35:06,513 --> 00:35:07,982
So that was a bit disappointing.

752
00:35:08,183 --> 00:35:09,982
- How are you doing these days? Yes. - Me?

753
00:35:11,053 --> 00:35:13,151
- I've been through many changes. - Really?

754
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:14,252
There have been changes.

755
00:35:14,823 --> 00:35:16,692
- I guess you've been through a lot. - Yes.

756
00:35:17,163 --> 00:35:19,561
But now, I'm a bit stable.

757
00:35:19,562 --> 00:35:20,691
- Is that so? - Yes.

758
00:35:20,692 --> 00:35:22,862
- What about you? - Me?

759
00:35:22,962 --> 00:35:23,962
How are you now?

760
00:35:24,603 --> 00:35:26,933
Things had been quiet and calm for me.

761
00:35:27,732 --> 00:35:30,402
But there are some waves now.

762
00:35:30,973 --> 00:35:33,103
I decided not to choose a destination.

763
00:35:33,143 --> 00:35:34,812
It wasn't changed. I just got rid of the destination.

764
00:35:34,973 --> 00:35:36,072
Here's how I thought.

765
00:35:36,073 --> 00:35:38,081
"Unless there's a natural disaster,"

766
00:35:38,082 --> 00:35:41,283
"the direction of this boat won't change."

767
00:35:43,382 --> 00:35:46,123
- But today is our last day. - Yes.

768
00:35:47,093 --> 00:35:48,192
- Just now, - Yes.

769
00:35:48,853 --> 00:35:49,893
the weather...

770
00:35:50,723 --> 00:35:52,522
There's a rainstorm with thunder and lightning.

771
00:35:53,062 --> 00:35:54,362
It's fun...

772
00:35:54,993 --> 00:35:56,791
to head to a destination with this kind of weather.

773
00:35:56,792 --> 00:35:57,962
Right. When the weather is bad.

774
00:35:58,263 --> 00:35:59,502
So...

775
00:35:59,663 --> 00:36:02,972
I had another big day today.

776
00:36:02,973 --> 00:36:04,573
(I see.)

777
00:36:05,073 --> 00:36:07,642
- It happened a while ago. - Is that so?

778
00:36:07,643 --> 00:36:10,913
I'm more at peace compared to this morning.

779
00:36:11,082 --> 00:36:12,611
- Have you found peace? - I must have.

780
00:36:12,612 --> 00:36:14,112
- Have you? - I think so.

781
00:36:17,723 --> 00:36:18,823
How's Jae Hyung these days?

782
00:36:19,152 --> 00:36:22,021
I think it takes a long time for him...

783
00:36:22,022 --> 00:36:23,662
to develop feelings.

784
00:36:23,663 --> 00:36:26,123
I think that's why he took quite long.

785
00:36:26,493 --> 00:36:29,032
- We had to keep picking someone. - Right.

786
00:36:29,033 --> 00:36:31,762
I think that made him more confused...

787
00:36:31,763 --> 00:36:33,132
for quite some time.

788
00:36:33,873 --> 00:36:35,032
But...

789
00:36:35,033 --> 00:36:37,803
I think he sort of found a direction now.

790
00:36:38,203 --> 00:36:41,542
When we started to think about what would come after this,

791
00:36:41,772 --> 00:36:45,041
everyone interpreted and accepted it in their own way.

792
00:36:45,042 --> 00:36:48,712
Jae Hyung must have his own idea about that just like everyone else.

793
00:36:48,783 --> 00:36:50,982
Right. He must have.

794
00:36:51,683 --> 00:36:53,022
I didn't get to see him a lot in Singapore.

795
00:36:53,522 --> 00:36:55,052
And we haven't talked much lately.

796
00:36:55,053 --> 00:36:56,822
- So... - But have you ever felt this way?

797
00:36:56,823 --> 00:36:58,592
However happened,

798
00:36:58,593 --> 00:37:01,831
- he hurt Ju Yeon in the end. - You mean Jae Hyung?

799
00:37:01,832 --> 00:37:05,132
I wonder if you ever thought he was mean or resented him.

800
00:37:05,402 --> 00:37:07,432
Well, he even has a face I would resent.

801
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:10,232
That's right. Thanks. Now, that hit the spot.

802
00:37:12,073 --> 00:37:14,473
I want to ask you a detailed question.

803
00:37:15,743 --> 00:37:17,382
- But you don't have to answer it. - Okay.

804
00:37:17,982 --> 00:37:20,882
You said you were neutral, but found a direction again.

805
00:37:21,283 --> 00:37:23,751
I'm curious how that was possible.

806
00:37:23,752 --> 00:37:26,122
You were once closed-off.

807
00:37:26,123 --> 00:37:28,692
- Right. - How could you open up again?

808
00:37:29,093 --> 00:37:31,493
I'm curious. But you don't have to answer it.

809
00:37:31,893 --> 00:37:34,462
I might not have said it clearly.

810
00:37:35,163 --> 00:37:36,362
I didn't go back.

811
00:37:38,462 --> 00:37:40,263
I was neutral. But...

812
00:37:41,033 --> 00:37:42,803
I'm leaning toward a new direction.

813
00:37:44,073 --> 00:37:46,643
I don't know how that could be possible at this point.

814
00:37:47,243 --> 00:37:50,842
When we had to send out a text message,

815
00:37:50,843 --> 00:37:52,611
there was a time I hesitated to text her.

816
00:37:52,612 --> 00:37:54,683
- That happened only once. - I see.

817
00:37:55,582 --> 00:37:57,252
She's the one who made me hesitate.

818
00:37:59,183 --> 00:38:00,993
But I wasn't aware of it back then.

819
00:38:01,853 --> 00:38:04,823
I finally realized that only today.

820
00:38:05,422 --> 00:38:06,493
I told you, didn't I?

821
00:38:06,823 --> 00:38:08,393
A natural disaster occurred just now.

822
00:38:13,603 --> 00:38:14,933
"Is he talking about me?"

823
00:38:15,433 --> 00:38:18,402
"Why does he suddenly like me?"

824
00:38:20,612 --> 00:38:22,171
- Seriously? - Gosh, Yong Woo...

825
00:38:22,172 --> 00:38:25,012
- is misleading so many people. - See?

826
00:38:25,013 --> 00:38:26,282
- Speak more clearly. - Gosh.

827
00:38:26,283 --> 00:38:27,482
- This can't be happening. - That...

828
00:38:27,783 --> 00:38:30,111
Yong Woo's speech style...

829
00:38:30,112 --> 00:38:32,481
is causing a lot of people to misunderstand him.

830
00:38:32,482 --> 00:38:34,392
- I'm one of the victims. - Se Seung...

831
00:38:34,393 --> 00:38:36,592
The secret date is their last date.

832
00:38:36,593 --> 00:38:38,361
Considering what he said after he had chosen her,

833
00:38:38,362 --> 00:38:40,092
- it'd be natural to misunderstand. - It's possible.

834
00:38:40,093 --> 00:38:41,892
- He did pick her for his date. - And...

835
00:38:41,893 --> 00:38:44,062
Let's say someone shows up and says all that out of the blue.

836
00:38:44,303 --> 00:38:45,303
"Does she like me?"

837
00:38:45,304 --> 00:38:47,502
- That's crazy. - He was an irresistible man.

838
00:38:47,573 --> 00:38:48,632
I told you, didn't I?

839
00:38:49,073 --> 00:38:50,672
A natural disaster occurred just now.

840
00:38:55,812 --> 00:38:57,283
"Is he talking about me?"

841
00:38:57,712 --> 00:39:00,413
"Why does he suddenly like me?"

842
00:39:01,053 --> 00:39:04,123
He went on a date with me and Ji Won.

843
00:39:04,683 --> 00:39:07,723
The fact that he's here...

844
00:39:07,893 --> 00:39:09,593
made me interpret it that way.

845
00:39:11,323 --> 00:39:12,922
When I sent him the message,

846
00:39:13,422 --> 00:39:16,061
I was a bit confused because I really enjoyed...

847
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:18,103
our date together.

848
00:39:18,502 --> 00:39:21,132
"Is it what I think it is?"

849
00:39:24,303 --> 00:39:25,603
Three weeks was too short, wasn't it?

850
00:39:25,873 --> 00:39:27,541
- Her gaze changed. - Look at her gaze.

851
00:39:27,542 --> 00:39:28,873
Oh, no.

852
00:39:29,513 --> 00:39:30,843
Her gaze changed.

853
00:39:31,112 --> 00:39:33,683
Seriously. Her gaze really changed. What was that?

854
00:39:34,683 --> 00:39:36,453
Gosh. This is so entertaining.

855
00:39:39,422 --> 00:39:40,853
Three weeks was too short, wasn't it?

856
00:39:41,053 --> 00:39:44,022
- it was way too short. - These three weeks...

857
00:39:52,533 --> 00:39:55,632
I thought you might have thought...

858
00:39:56,232 --> 00:39:57,942
it was kind of random.

859
00:39:59,942 --> 00:40:01,073
It seems...

860
00:40:02,643 --> 00:40:05,381
you especially have a hard time when you make other people...

861
00:40:05,382 --> 00:40:06,581
unhappy.

862
00:40:06,582 --> 00:40:08,013
Of course, it's hard for everyone.

863
00:40:08,853 --> 00:40:09,981
Do you think I wouldn't have thought that?

864
00:40:09,982 --> 00:40:11,021
We only have a few days left.

865
00:40:11,022 --> 00:40:12,882
- That's right. - We have less than a week left.

866
00:40:13,123 --> 00:40:15,393
Why wouldn't I have thought, "Let's just stick to this?"

867
00:40:16,053 --> 00:40:19,061
But I thought I'd definitely regret doing that.

868
00:40:19,062 --> 00:40:21,692
And I thought it was rude to that person too.

869
00:40:22,192 --> 00:40:23,593
Treating her in an untruthful manner.

870
00:40:26,402 --> 00:40:30,771
Yesterday, when we had to send text messages...

871
00:40:30,772 --> 00:40:32,402
- about this event today, - Yes.

872
00:40:32,803 --> 00:40:35,211
I didn't think too hard about it.

873
00:40:35,212 --> 00:40:37,481
- I see. - Not thinking too hard about it...

874
00:40:37,482 --> 00:40:39,683
and putting down your name was a good thing.

875
00:40:39,743 --> 00:40:41,353
I think I got some energy.

876
00:40:42,152 --> 00:40:45,582
I think I energized myself for tomorrow.

877
00:40:56,292 --> 00:40:58,163
(The Secret Date has ended.)

878
00:40:58,902 --> 00:41:00,303
It's over, I guess.

879
00:41:02,232 --> 00:41:03,232
It was fun.

880
00:41:03,233 --> 00:41:06,272
(Se Seung and Yong Woo's Secret Date ends.)

881
00:41:07,743 --> 00:41:10,042
(Yong Woo leaves first.)

882
00:41:11,513 --> 00:41:14,112
The Secret Date made me feel very distraught.

883
00:41:14,913 --> 00:41:16,652
His direction changed.

884
00:41:18,283 --> 00:41:19,553
Who was he referring to?

885
00:41:20,183 --> 00:41:21,623
Was he talking about me?

886
00:41:22,053 --> 00:41:24,122
I would be able to think more about it if I was certain...

887
00:41:24,123 --> 00:41:25,292
that it was me.

888
00:41:25,792 --> 00:41:28,393
I suddenly feel like...

889
00:41:28,962 --> 00:41:30,803
I don't have enough time.

890
00:41:31,832 --> 00:41:33,303
If it wasn't me,

891
00:41:33,402 --> 00:41:36,831
he wouldn't have needed to say it in such a confusing manner, right?

892
00:41:36,832 --> 00:41:38,172
Judging from how Yong Woo is?

893
00:41:39,172 --> 00:41:40,941
But I couldn't ask,

894
00:41:40,942 --> 00:41:42,743
"Who is that person?"

895
00:41:43,112 --> 00:41:45,442
Because I was scared that it was about me.

896
00:41:45,812 --> 00:41:48,812
How should I accept that feeling...

897
00:41:49,152 --> 00:41:50,982
without any preparation?

898
00:41:52,882 --> 00:41:56,151
I don't know if I'm being a weathercock,

899
00:41:56,152 --> 00:42:00,191
but the time my feelings for him got smaller, it was reduced to 90,

900
00:42:00,192 --> 00:42:03,562
and about 10 to 15 had gone to Yong Woo.

901
00:42:03,962 --> 00:42:07,672
Because I thought, "I should date someone like Yong Woo."

902
00:42:08,272 --> 00:42:10,742
When I was on a date with him, I kept being mindful of him,

903
00:42:10,743 --> 00:42:12,603
and I felt physically uncomfortable.

904
00:42:13,573 --> 00:42:17,243
If he wasn't headed for Cho A,

905
00:42:17,612 --> 00:42:21,712
it might not have been entirely impossible.

906
00:42:22,353 --> 00:42:25,683
Actually, he never sent me a message.

907
00:42:26,922 --> 00:42:29,823
When did he grow his feelings for me to the point...

908
00:42:30,093 --> 00:42:31,962
of changing the direction of his heart?

909
00:42:32,623 --> 00:42:33,692
Why?

910
00:42:34,192 --> 00:42:36,962
And it felt cool, that courage.

911
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:40,603
I think he suits the word "cool" the best.

912
00:42:44,902 --> 00:42:46,202
- He didn't muster up the courage. - Se Seung!

913
00:42:46,203 --> 00:42:48,311
Get a grip! That's not it.

914
00:42:48,312 --> 00:42:49,671
He didn't muster up the courage.

915
00:42:49,672 --> 00:42:50,672
- You've been doing fine. - Se Seung.

916
00:42:50,673 --> 00:42:51,682
Cool, my foot.

917
00:42:51,683 --> 00:42:54,882
Even the ever-so-wise Se Seung got infected by the virus.

918
00:42:55,212 --> 00:42:57,722
Oh dear, she's shaken.

919
00:42:57,723 --> 00:42:59,322
- We're nearing the end. - This is a soap opera.

920
00:42:59,323 --> 00:43:02,223
Actually, all the girls liked Yong Woo.

921
00:43:02,593 --> 00:43:03,593
Look at what's happening now.

922
00:43:03,594 --> 00:43:05,061
- I think so too. - This is...

923
00:43:05,062 --> 00:43:06,191
- No. - I think so too.

924
00:43:06,192 --> 00:43:07,263
This is so...

925
00:43:07,792 --> 00:43:09,962
- If this is life, it's so wrong. - It gives me chills.

926
00:43:11,462 --> 00:43:13,533
How will someone like me live then?

927
00:43:13,832 --> 00:43:14,872
Then...

928
00:43:14,873 --> 00:43:17,373
The world is full of lies then.

929
00:43:17,603 --> 00:43:18,873
Why are you angry?

930
00:43:18,973 --> 00:43:20,541
"Jonathan, I enjoyed watching your show."

931
00:43:20,542 --> 00:43:21,542
- "I enjoyed My Sibling's Romance." - Why are you...

932
00:43:21,543 --> 00:43:23,743
- They're all lies. - Why are you angry?

933
00:43:23,873 --> 00:43:25,342
"You're cute." They're all lies.

934
00:43:25,343 --> 00:43:27,412
No, you are cute, Jonathan.

935
00:43:27,413 --> 00:43:28,683
- It's all a lie. - Jonathan.

936
00:43:29,112 --> 00:43:30,211
I'm going to get rebellious.

937
00:43:30,212 --> 00:43:31,622
- You're handsome. - Don't talk to me.

938
00:43:31,623 --> 00:43:35,723
Yong Woo might've said things honestly,

939
00:43:36,093 --> 00:43:37,992
but because he wasn't honest with what he said at the start,

940
00:43:37,993 --> 00:43:39,561
- everything he said at the back... - They got tangled.

941
00:43:39,562 --> 00:43:41,593
ended up following that.

942
00:43:41,763 --> 00:43:43,861
They became words to back it up.

943
00:43:43,862 --> 00:43:45,603
Because he didn't say the front part clearly.

944
00:43:45,803 --> 00:43:46,961
- That's right. - If he had said,

945
00:43:46,962 --> 00:43:48,171
"I grew feelings for Ji Won,"

946
00:43:48,172 --> 00:43:49,172
- That's right. - None of his words...

947
00:43:49,172 --> 00:43:50,172
would've caused misunderstandings.

948
00:43:50,332 --> 00:43:52,643
Se Seung will go nuts now.

949
00:43:58,743 --> 00:44:00,612
(Sighing)

950
00:44:19,462 --> 00:44:20,462
Hello.

951
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:22,033
You're here.

952
00:44:22,232 --> 00:44:23,873
You brought a cute bag.

953
00:44:24,073 --> 00:44:25,203
- Is it cute? - Yes.

954
00:44:26,073 --> 00:44:27,303
You got a bit wet in the rain.

955
00:44:27,612 --> 00:44:28,712
Did you get drenched?

956
00:44:30,442 --> 00:44:34,752
There was something I wanted to ask Ji Won when I met her.

957
00:44:34,953 --> 00:44:36,783
We had a talk in the terrace.

958
00:44:37,112 --> 00:44:40,382
I really enjoyed that time too.

959
00:44:40,683 --> 00:44:42,852
But I got the feeling...

960
00:44:42,853 --> 00:44:44,263
that I was pressuring you.

961
00:44:44,422 --> 00:44:46,792
It's not because I found you uncomfortable.

962
00:44:47,123 --> 00:44:50,232
For me, rather than feeling fluttered,

963
00:44:50,433 --> 00:44:52,303
I've dated a lot of people...

964
00:44:52,803 --> 00:44:56,171
who was fun and cute and could take me away...

965
00:44:56,172 --> 00:44:59,743
from my reality and my many thoughts.

966
00:45:00,703 --> 00:45:05,042
But I couldn't really exchange deep emotions.

967
00:45:05,413 --> 00:45:07,112
But when I came here,

968
00:45:07,343 --> 00:45:11,183
I came with the determination, "Let's make a different choice."

969
00:45:12,152 --> 00:45:13,421
I see.

970
00:45:13,422 --> 00:45:15,422
I was thinking of you the other way around.

971
00:45:16,152 --> 00:45:18,362
I thought you wanted to...

972
00:45:18,462 --> 00:45:21,862
meet someone who isn't serious and is funny.

973
00:45:22,763 --> 00:45:24,803
But you've dated people like that...

974
00:45:25,303 --> 00:45:27,461
and you wanted to meet someone with deeper emotional exchange?

975
00:45:27,462 --> 00:45:28,473
So...

976
00:45:28,902 --> 00:45:32,643
I did think that you had the most similar vibe as me.

977
00:45:32,902 --> 00:45:35,542
But for now,

978
00:45:36,243 --> 00:45:39,941
I want to meet someone...

979
00:45:39,942 --> 00:45:43,112
who can make me become brighter.

980
00:45:43,283 --> 00:45:45,652
I see.

981
00:45:46,482 --> 00:45:48,893
You didn't misunderstand.

982
00:45:49,053 --> 00:45:51,623
I myself keep getting confused.

983
00:45:52,062 --> 00:45:53,893
There were moments where I acknowledged...

984
00:45:54,462 --> 00:45:58,062
that it was right to meet someone like that in here.

985
00:45:58,462 --> 00:46:03,102
Then I decided to make a different choice here,

986
00:46:03,103 --> 00:46:05,772
but that decision disappeared without me realizing,

987
00:46:06,042 --> 00:46:08,441
and I became like this naturally.

988
00:46:08,442 --> 00:46:11,612
I came to a stage where I realized that.

989
00:46:12,082 --> 00:46:16,211
Things are very complicated for me right now, to be honest.

990
00:46:16,212 --> 00:46:18,481
So I'm trying to go back to the very first time...

991
00:46:18,482 --> 00:46:20,882
and take part in this without thinking about anything.

992
00:46:23,192 --> 00:46:24,892
I understood it as her wanting...

993
00:46:24,893 --> 00:46:28,493
to meet someone simple because she's dated serious guys.

994
00:46:28,732 --> 00:46:30,732
But even as she talked about serious things,

995
00:46:31,062 --> 00:46:33,401
she said she didn't want to meet a guy like that.

996
00:46:33,402 --> 00:46:37,272
She kept changing, so I felt a bit frustrated.

997
00:46:38,373 --> 00:46:42,771
You as a person hit it off with me,

998
00:46:42,772 --> 00:46:44,882
and we speak the same language.

999
00:46:45,413 --> 00:46:47,242
But when I talk with you,

1000
00:46:47,243 --> 00:46:50,053
I feel like I'm going to cry.

1001
00:46:50,683 --> 00:46:52,922
- Should I say... - Why?

1002
00:46:53,922 --> 00:46:56,352
that my mind gets weaker?

1003
00:46:56,353 --> 00:46:57,823
- I see. - Yes.

1004
00:46:58,522 --> 00:47:00,823
I know the weak sides that I have,

1005
00:47:01,033 --> 00:47:03,492
so when I talk with you,

1006
00:47:03,493 --> 00:47:07,632
I think it will be harder for me to become firmer.

1007
00:47:07,933 --> 00:47:10,103
I'm scared of turning soft.

1008
00:47:10,573 --> 00:47:13,573
Cheol Hyeon is very sensitive and thoughtful.

1009
00:47:13,772 --> 00:47:15,872
So when I'm with him,

1010
00:47:15,873 --> 00:47:19,183
my emotions tend to get deeper.

1011
00:47:20,183 --> 00:47:22,111
That side of him is great,

1012
00:47:22,112 --> 00:47:23,682
and I can relate to him the most.

1013
00:47:23,683 --> 00:47:29,623
But I get the strange feeling that my inner weakest part...

1014
00:47:29,893 --> 00:47:31,493
of me might come out.

1015
00:47:32,223 --> 00:47:36,593
Right now, I am in a situation where I need to overcome it,

1016
00:47:36,763 --> 00:47:40,232
so that's the emotion I want to avoid.

1017
00:47:40,632 --> 00:47:44,643
I think it's because I want to get firmer.

1018
00:47:45,143 --> 00:47:48,373
(Let's enjoy the remaining time more.)

1019
00:47:48,743 --> 00:47:51,913
(Did you have fun today?)

1020
00:47:52,112 --> 00:47:55,683
(Ji Won, let's go on a date!)

1021
00:47:56,053 --> 00:47:58,652
(Was it fun today?)

1022
00:47:58,953 --> 00:48:01,123
I want to go on a date with you.

1023
00:48:02,053 --> 00:48:04,022
I want to go on a date with Ji Won.

1024
00:48:04,593 --> 00:48:07,493
I haven't had a proper date with her yet.

1025
00:48:07,893 --> 00:48:10,263
I couldn't have a proper date with Ji Won.

1026
00:48:10,632 --> 00:48:12,802
Even if I don't get to do it until the day we leave,

1027
00:48:12,803 --> 00:48:14,632
I will keep texting Ji Won.

1028
00:48:15,033 --> 00:48:19,672
(The final Secret Date she chose after thinking long and hard)

1029
00:48:20,973 --> 00:48:24,711
He always wanted to have a date with me...

1030
00:48:24,712 --> 00:48:26,212
and wanted to talk with me.

1031
00:48:26,413 --> 00:48:31,482
I wanted to understand his feelings more too.

1032
00:48:31,723 --> 00:48:36,453
He tried so hard not to make me feel uncomfortable.

1033
00:48:36,893 --> 00:48:40,361
But I wondered if it was right to keep pushing him away...

1034
00:48:40,362 --> 00:48:43,962
as if I'm finding him very uncomfortable.

1035
00:48:44,292 --> 00:48:48,172
I wanted to tell him why I didn't choose him...

1036
00:48:48,402 --> 00:48:53,103
even though we got along so well.

1037
00:48:53,243 --> 00:48:55,612
I think that was why I chose Cheol Hyeon.

1038
00:48:57,513 --> 00:48:58,612
I understand.

1039
00:48:59,212 --> 00:49:01,812
I completely understand what you're thinking too.

1040
00:49:03,413 --> 00:49:05,151
- Bye, Cheol Hyeon. - See you later.

1041
00:49:05,152 --> 00:49:06,152
See you.

1042
00:49:06,153 --> 00:49:07,623
(Ji Won and Cheol Hyeon's Secret Date ends.)

1043
00:49:13,192 --> 00:49:16,562
(Alkaff Mansion)

1044
00:49:28,973 --> 00:49:30,343
It's so pretty.

1045
00:49:51,232 --> 00:49:55,172
I only requested for Se Seung, of course.

1046
00:49:55,672 --> 00:49:57,303
I didn't really think hard.

1047
00:49:58,172 --> 00:50:00,502
Se Seung probably chose me.

1048
00:50:00,743 --> 00:50:02,913
Not probably. I'm sure she chose me.

1049
00:50:03,772 --> 00:50:07,243
(He waits for Se Seung.)

1050
00:50:09,283 --> 00:50:11,882
(A taxi arrives at the entrance.)

1051
00:50:12,323 --> 00:50:14,252
I just want to run away.

1052
00:50:14,853 --> 00:50:17,251
Yong Woo, why did you do that?

1053
00:50:17,252 --> 00:50:18,422
She wants to run away.

1054
00:50:18,823 --> 00:50:20,592
This is almost like her in a wedding dress...

1055
00:50:20,593 --> 00:50:22,731
- before going into a wedding hall. - You're right.

1056
00:50:22,732 --> 00:50:25,501
She's so close to becoming a runaway bride.

1057
00:50:25,502 --> 00:50:26,901
No, I believe in Se Seung.

1058
00:50:26,902 --> 00:50:29,102
Se Seung, please don't waver.

1059
00:50:29,103 --> 00:50:30,532
- No, she won't waver. - Jung Sub, you can do it.

1060
00:50:30,533 --> 00:50:31,602
- I don't think she'll waver. - Se Seung...

1061
00:50:31,603 --> 00:50:33,502
I don't think Se Seung wavered.

1062
00:50:35,873 --> 00:50:37,882
I just want to run away.

1063
00:50:38,882 --> 00:50:39,941
This is crazy.

1064
00:50:39,942 --> 00:50:41,212
(Sighing)

1065
00:50:42,783 --> 00:50:43,853
This is hard.

1066
00:50:46,053 --> 00:50:47,652
Nothing's easy.

1067
00:50:53,393 --> 00:50:54,422
- Hello. - You're here.

1068
00:50:55,993 --> 00:50:58,062
- Are you the owner here? - Have a seat.

1069
00:50:58,433 --> 00:50:59,501
Did you wait for a long time?

1070
00:50:59,502 --> 00:51:01,303
- No, I didn't. - You didn't?

1071
00:51:01,502 --> 00:51:03,401
Isn't it very pretty here?

1072
00:51:03,402 --> 00:51:04,432
- Yes. - Right?

1073
00:51:04,433 --> 00:51:06,041
They have weddings here, apparently.

1074
00:51:06,042 --> 00:51:07,373
- Really? - Yes.

1075
00:51:07,743 --> 00:51:10,873
It costs 48,000 dollars to have a wedding here.

1076
00:51:11,143 --> 00:51:12,611
- Did you look it up? - I did.

1077
00:51:12,612 --> 00:51:13,913
- Have you been doing well? - Yes.

1078
00:51:15,152 --> 00:51:16,182
I was very busy.

1079
00:51:16,183 --> 00:51:17,811
- You were very busy? - I was very busy.

1080
00:51:17,812 --> 00:51:18,823
Were you?

1081
00:51:19,522 --> 00:51:20,623
What did you do?

1082
00:51:21,323 --> 00:51:22,422
I watched the rain.

1083
00:51:23,223 --> 00:51:25,062
I'm quite curious.

1084
00:51:27,792 --> 00:51:30,093
I want to know everything. What will you do?

1085
00:51:33,703 --> 00:51:35,672
On a rainy day like today,

1086
00:51:36,103 --> 00:51:38,772
it must be tiring to go on multiple dates.

1087
00:51:41,243 --> 00:51:42,873
You're forbidden.

1088
00:51:43,112 --> 00:51:44,742
- Forbidden? - Forbidden to do stuff like that.

1089
00:51:44,743 --> 00:51:45,783
Okay.

1090
00:51:46,042 --> 00:51:47,712
Their pizza's good.

1091
00:51:47,843 --> 00:51:49,152
- Are you hungry? Let's eat. - Steak...

1092
00:51:49,612 --> 00:51:50,852
- Have you eaten? - What?

1093
00:51:50,853 --> 00:51:51,922
Have you eaten?

1094
00:51:52,882 --> 00:51:53,921
Yes.

1095
00:51:53,922 --> 00:51:54,993
- You've eaten? - Yes.

1096
00:51:55,223 --> 00:51:56,893
- Then... - Haven't you?

1097
00:51:56,993 --> 00:51:59,663
It's been a while since I last ate.

1098
00:52:00,223 --> 00:52:01,832
Let's eat something you want.

1099
00:52:01,962 --> 00:52:03,392
There's pizza as you said.

1100
00:52:03,393 --> 00:52:05,033
- The pizza's good. - Do you want pizza?

1101
00:52:05,402 --> 00:52:07,502
- What did you eat just now? - Just now?

1102
00:52:07,732 --> 00:52:10,032
I can't tell you what I ate.

1103
00:52:10,033 --> 00:52:11,073
- Really? - Yes.

1104
00:52:15,272 --> 00:52:17,343
Okay. Don't tell me.

1105
00:52:18,413 --> 00:52:19,413
(Sighing)

1106
00:52:20,013 --> 00:52:22,152
Se Seung's face...

1107
00:52:22,453 --> 00:52:26,553
didn't exactly look like she was purely happy to see me.

1108
00:52:26,683 --> 00:52:28,453
"Is she nervous?"

1109
00:52:28,623 --> 00:52:30,453
Something felt strange.

1110
00:52:33,962 --> 00:52:35,533
I was too distraught.

1111
00:52:35,893 --> 00:52:38,703
In my head, I knew I shouldn't have done that.

1112
00:52:39,203 --> 00:52:41,671
So I couldn't focus in the beginning.

1113
00:52:41,672 --> 00:52:42,771
It looks delicious.

1114
00:52:42,772 --> 00:52:43,973
(The food they ordered is served.)

1115
00:52:45,942 --> 00:52:46,942
It's barbecue.

1116
00:52:47,672 --> 00:52:49,413
It makes me exclaim as soon as I eat it.

1117
00:52:49,812 --> 00:52:51,711
(Impressed)

1118
00:52:51,712 --> 00:52:52,942
It's so delicious.

1119
00:52:53,243 --> 00:52:54,882
- Isn't it delicious? - It's delicious.

1120
00:52:55,112 --> 00:52:56,683
Eat up.

1121
00:52:57,212 --> 00:52:58,953
(Picking at food)

1122
00:52:59,582 --> 00:53:01,053
(Humming)

1123
00:53:01,183 --> 00:53:02,323
- Jung Sub. - Yes.

1124
00:53:02,623 --> 00:53:04,553
- The final selection. - What?

1125
00:53:04,823 --> 00:53:07,462
Do you think about after the final selection?

1126
00:53:08,033 --> 00:53:09,663
- The final selection? I do. - A lot?

1127
00:53:10,663 --> 00:53:12,002
What do you mean by a lot?

1128
00:53:12,303 --> 00:53:14,132
- Once every day? - No.

1129
00:53:14,402 --> 00:53:16,072
Once something is more or less decided,

1130
00:53:16,073 --> 00:53:18,343
everyone thinks about what comes after.

1131
00:53:19,603 --> 00:53:22,542
I think that's a very hard question.

1132
00:53:24,073 --> 00:53:26,611
It's not a question that I can answer simply.

1133
00:53:26,612 --> 00:53:27,842
- Why? - What?

1134
00:53:27,843 --> 00:53:28,853
Why?

1135
00:53:29,712 --> 00:53:30,953
- Why? - Yes.

1136
00:53:31,723 --> 00:53:32,953
Why is it hard?

1137
00:53:35,393 --> 00:53:37,752
I just want to be careful.

1138
00:53:40,062 --> 00:53:41,263
You could imagine it, right?

1139
00:53:41,692 --> 00:53:43,062
I did think a lot about it.

1140
00:53:43,632 --> 00:53:45,763
I did think about it.

1141
00:53:45,933 --> 00:53:48,772
I tried to imagine it.

1142
00:53:49,203 --> 00:53:52,242
But I end up thinking,

1143
00:53:52,243 --> 00:53:54,373
"What should I do?"

1144
00:53:55,743 --> 00:53:56,772
(Glancing)

1145
00:54:12,493 --> 00:54:15,433
How did you think about what comes after the final selection?

1146
00:54:17,033 --> 00:54:19,562
Rather than "how,"

1147
00:54:19,862 --> 00:54:21,873
- I just... - Should I order one more?

1148
00:54:24,473 --> 00:54:26,171
Do everything you want, Jung Sub.

1149
00:54:26,172 --> 00:54:27,243
Thank you so much.

1150
00:54:27,542 --> 00:54:29,942
(Jung Sub is hungry.)

1151
00:54:34,612 --> 00:54:36,553
For now,

1152
00:54:37,152 --> 00:54:41,022
I tried to focus on what happened in here, and I wanted to do that.

1153
00:54:42,623 --> 00:54:45,962
As for what comes after, I haven't thought about it properly yet.

1154
00:54:47,893 --> 00:54:49,631
There are too many things to think about right now.

1155
00:54:49,632 --> 00:54:50,663
- That's right. - Yes.

1156
00:54:51,033 --> 00:54:53,432
I wanted to know whether you thought about it or not.

1157
00:54:53,433 --> 00:54:54,433
I see.

1158
00:54:54,434 --> 00:54:57,272
I don't think I think about it...

1159
00:54:58,143 --> 00:54:59,603
as much as you do.

1160
00:55:05,882 --> 00:55:07,712
Se Seung, why did you get moody again?

1161
00:55:07,843 --> 00:55:09,053
Did I get moody?

1162
00:55:10,882 --> 00:55:11,953
Is it funny?

1163
00:55:12,422 --> 00:55:13,482
I'm sorry.

1164
00:55:13,982 --> 00:55:15,792
Why, what...

1165
00:55:16,393 --> 00:55:17,422
Why?

1166
00:55:20,223 --> 00:55:21,422
I'm upset.

1167
00:55:22,962 --> 00:55:25,362
What does Jung Sub mean?

1168
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:30,072
Since you brought up what comes after,

1169
00:55:30,073 --> 00:55:32,402
I'm thinking about it a lot right now.

1170
00:55:33,143 --> 00:55:34,572
- Don't think about it. - What?

1171
00:55:34,573 --> 00:55:35,643
Don't think about it.

1172
00:55:36,643 --> 00:55:41,143
I thought about what "final selection" meant.

1173
00:55:41,712 --> 00:55:45,853
The feelings I felt in here and the selection based on that.

1174
00:55:46,353 --> 00:55:47,952
I could do that, or like you,

1175
00:55:47,953 --> 00:55:51,493
I could make the selection by considering what comes after too.

1176
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:55,893
I think everyone has their own way of the "final selection."

1177
00:55:59,103 --> 00:56:01,672
What is "final selection" to you?

1178
00:56:02,803 --> 00:56:04,303
What is "final selection" to me?

1179
00:56:10,343 --> 00:56:12,042
I think my final selection...

1180
00:56:13,082 --> 00:56:14,882
is future-oriented.

1181
00:56:15,353 --> 00:56:16,482
- Really? - Yes.

1182
00:56:16,853 --> 00:56:18,553
- You consider the future too? - Yes.

1183
00:56:19,223 --> 00:56:20,323
It's very...

1184
00:56:22,053 --> 00:56:23,353
It's a lot deeper.

1185
00:56:26,522 --> 00:56:29,033
"Do you think about what comes after the final selection?"

1186
00:56:29,362 --> 00:56:31,832
"You were thinking that far."

1187
00:56:32,232 --> 00:56:33,603
I felt very hurt.

1188
00:56:34,362 --> 00:56:36,502
"Then what have I been doing for the past three weeks?"

1189
00:56:36,973 --> 00:56:40,401
If the final selection really is just about...

1190
00:56:40,402 --> 00:56:42,612
which direction you're pointing at after the three weeks,

1191
00:56:42,873 --> 00:56:46,381
there wouldn't have been a reason for me to spend...

1192
00:56:46,382 --> 00:56:48,852
so much emotional energy to run until here.

1193
00:56:48,853 --> 00:56:50,251
It's such a normal thing...

1194
00:56:50,252 --> 00:56:52,123
to think about what comes next.

1195
00:56:57,893 --> 00:57:00,292
You look like you have a lot on your mind.

1196
00:57:04,232 --> 00:57:05,402
What are you thinking about?

1197
00:57:08,373 --> 00:57:09,373
I wonder.

1198
00:57:21,783 --> 00:57:24,783
I think her expression became dark.

1199
00:57:25,252 --> 00:57:26,722
The atmosphere was bad.

1200
00:57:26,723 --> 00:57:28,453
What I'm curious about is,

1201
00:57:28,723 --> 00:57:32,392
I think it's strange not to think about the future...

1202
00:57:32,393 --> 00:57:34,061
after that.

1203
00:57:34,062 --> 00:57:35,461
"It's over once I've made my choice."

1204
00:57:35,462 --> 00:57:36,792
How is this possible?

1205
00:57:37,493 --> 00:57:38,933
What meaning does that have?

1206
00:57:39,232 --> 00:57:42,672
Just a token showing that we exchanged this kind of stuff...

1207
00:57:42,933 --> 00:57:44,803
for three weeks? That's it?

1208
00:57:48,573 --> 00:57:50,311
- Where do you stay? - What?

1209
00:57:50,312 --> 00:57:52,042
Do you normally stay in that house?

1210
00:57:52,143 --> 00:57:53,143
Yes.

1211
00:57:53,712 --> 00:57:54,982
When are you going to switch your job?

1212
00:57:55,152 --> 00:57:56,783
- What? - When are you switching your job?

1213
00:57:59,652 --> 00:58:00,652
I don't know.

1214
00:58:07,362 --> 00:58:09,362
Meeting after that is a reality.

1215
00:58:09,433 --> 00:58:10,433
Yes.

1216
00:58:10,434 --> 00:58:14,532
But switching jobs is just my...

1217
00:58:14,533 --> 00:58:17,072
I'm saying you'll get busy...

1218
00:58:17,073 --> 00:58:18,373
facing your reality.

1219
00:58:18,473 --> 00:58:20,843
- That is my reality, yes. - Yes.

1220
00:58:21,143 --> 00:58:23,272
What pops up in my mind is,

1221
00:58:24,513 --> 00:58:25,581
"What should I do?"

1222
00:58:25,582 --> 00:58:27,041
"After that, how should I do it?"

1223
00:58:27,042 --> 00:58:29,413
"How should I continue this relationship?"

1224
00:58:29,812 --> 00:58:32,582
My "how" literally means this.

1225
00:58:32,982 --> 00:58:35,053
"How do we meet physically?"

1226
00:58:35,723 --> 00:58:37,893
- That's what I mean. - I see.

1227
00:58:38,323 --> 00:58:39,992
The more he answered,

1228
00:58:39,993 --> 00:58:42,932
he could tell that my face was getting darker.

1229
00:58:42,933 --> 00:58:46,663
So he thought about it like, "I'll think about it now."

1230
00:58:46,803 --> 00:58:48,163
And his answer was,

1231
00:58:48,402 --> 00:58:51,803
"How do we meet physically?"

1232
00:58:52,272 --> 00:58:53,703
So he really didn't give it a thought.

1233
00:58:53,973 --> 00:58:57,842
I felt like Se Seung wanted...

1234
00:58:57,843 --> 00:59:02,853
to start dating right after the show ended.

1235
00:59:03,053 --> 00:59:04,512
But actually,

1236
00:59:04,513 --> 00:59:07,622
I was more toward having some time to get to know each other.

1237
00:59:07,623 --> 00:59:10,522
Meeting after the show is very real.

1238
00:59:10,823 --> 00:59:15,462
If you tell me just vaguely to have a meeting,

1239
00:59:15,933 --> 00:59:19,302
"How?" That's what I feel.

1240
00:59:19,303 --> 00:59:21,973
Just meeting isn't all there is to it.

1241
00:59:34,612 --> 00:59:36,081
Something felt really bad.

1242
00:59:36,082 --> 00:59:39,723
I felt that something was seriously wrong.

1243
00:59:39,882 --> 00:59:43,623
I had the feeling that Se Seung didn't want to listen to me anymore.

1244
00:59:44,292 --> 00:59:46,291
Our silence was very long.

1245
00:59:46,292 --> 00:59:48,323
We spent a long time not talking.

1246
00:59:48,933 --> 00:59:52,062
The time spent with Jung Sub felt long for the first time.

1247
00:59:52,433 --> 00:59:54,001
"Since I found out about his thoughts,"

1248
00:59:54,002 --> 00:59:57,332
"will anything change from talking with him?"

1249
00:59:57,573 --> 00:59:59,373
"I don't need any more time with him."

1250
01:00:00,973 --> 01:00:02,743
- See you later. - See you.

1251
01:00:03,513 --> 01:00:07,312
(Se Seung got up first.)

1252
01:00:26,232 --> 01:00:27,603
I was very hurt.

1253
01:00:28,132 --> 01:00:29,132
She cried.

1254
01:00:29,133 --> 01:00:31,072
- Oh, dear. - She's crying.

1255
01:00:31,073 --> 01:00:32,342
- I mean... - This is the worst.

1256
01:00:32,343 --> 01:00:34,271
- Poor her. - That's bound to make you cry.

1257
01:00:34,272 --> 01:00:35,272
Poor her.

1258
01:00:35,442 --> 01:00:37,041
You can't help but get hurt at that.

1259
01:00:37,042 --> 01:00:38,413
You'd get hurt so bad.

1260
01:00:38,683 --> 01:00:41,342
Those tears are almost that of a breakup.

1261
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:43,112
- They aren't from disappointment. - Right.

1262
01:00:43,283 --> 01:00:45,152
No.

1263
01:00:47,223 --> 01:00:50,393
(Jung Sub is left alone.)

1264
01:00:51,862 --> 01:00:53,962
I tried to talk,

1265
01:00:54,192 --> 01:00:57,393
but Se Seung said she had to go and got up.

1266
01:00:57,763 --> 01:01:01,562
It felt like Se Seung quickly jumped to a conclusion again...

1267
01:01:01,732 --> 01:01:03,732
and abandoned me.

1268
01:01:03,933 --> 01:01:07,343
I think that made it harder for me.

1269
01:01:09,312 --> 01:01:11,212
"Did I express myself wrongly?"

1270
01:01:11,513 --> 01:01:12,812
"Was I wrong?"

1271
01:01:13,643 --> 01:01:15,152
I wanted to say that we should be thoughtful.

1272
01:01:15,382 --> 01:01:17,481
The final selection is one thing,

1273
01:01:17,482 --> 01:01:19,183
but the meeting after that...

1274
01:01:19,522 --> 01:01:21,553
We both have our realities to go back to.

1275
01:01:21,853 --> 01:01:24,192
When I go back, I need to start on a research project immediately.

1276
01:01:24,323 --> 01:01:25,993
I need to give a follow-up to my professor.

1277
01:01:26,723 --> 01:01:30,393
It was obvious that I was going to be busy after we started dating.

1278
01:01:30,562 --> 01:01:34,033
Can Se Seung understand that?

1279
01:01:34,462 --> 01:01:37,703
My feelings for Se Seung is growing,

1280
01:01:38,033 --> 01:01:40,542
and I want to talk about what we're going to do.

1281
01:01:40,973 --> 01:01:44,413
But use that time to date first instead of thinking about this?

1282
01:01:44,772 --> 01:01:46,913
I'm not that kind of person.

1283
01:01:48,413 --> 01:01:49,752
Seriously, what should I do?

1284
01:01:51,053 --> 01:01:53,922
The present is very important to him.

1285
01:01:54,582 --> 01:01:58,123
He never thought about the future with me.

1286
01:01:58,593 --> 01:02:01,192
No wonder the guy with so many questions...

1287
01:02:01,623 --> 01:02:03,562
never talked about the future.

1288
01:02:03,862 --> 01:02:05,803
He just never thought about it.

1289
01:02:06,632 --> 01:02:08,803
It feels like I woke up from a dream.

1290
01:02:10,232 --> 01:02:14,103
Yong Woo suddenly came to me today as it was,

1291
01:02:14,373 --> 01:02:17,973
and in this very confusing situation,

1292
01:02:18,112 --> 01:02:20,042
a huge wave...

1293
01:02:20,882 --> 01:02:22,152
suddenly...

1294
01:02:32,223 --> 01:02:33,822
(Yun Jae came here to meet Yun Ha.)

1295
01:02:33,823 --> 01:02:35,933
I thought Yun Ha no matter what.

1296
01:02:40,263 --> 01:02:43,401
I couldn't help but think negatively...

1297
01:02:43,402 --> 01:02:44,902
since I was feeling nervous.

1298
01:02:45,132 --> 01:02:47,473
On Thursday, why...

1299
01:02:48,913 --> 01:02:50,572
(The day before yesterday, Yun Jae didn't get a text...)

1300
01:02:50,573 --> 01:02:52,013
(from Yun Ha for the first time.)

1301
01:02:56,982 --> 01:03:00,882
(Anxiety washed over Yun Jae.)

1302
01:03:02,292 --> 01:03:04,353
"I should tell her my feelings well."

1303
01:03:04,792 --> 01:03:06,862
I only thought about that.

1304
01:03:07,862 --> 01:03:11,292
(He tries to muster up his courage to bring up that day.)

1305
01:03:19,902 --> 01:03:20,973
Hello.

1306
01:03:21,573 --> 01:03:23,073
Hello.

1307
01:03:24,973 --> 01:03:28,312
(Yun Ha and Yun Jae's Secret Date)

1308
01:03:32,853 --> 01:03:34,823
I thought I got comfortable around you,

1309
01:03:35,053 --> 01:03:36,422
- What? - but I'm feeling nervous again.

1310
01:03:36,893 --> 01:03:37,993
Me too.

1311
01:03:38,893 --> 01:03:41,962
I think I'm feeling that too now.

1312
01:03:44,993 --> 01:03:48,302
Even to sit down there and say the first sentence,

1313
01:03:48,303 --> 01:03:49,501
I felt so nervous.

1314
01:03:49,502 --> 01:03:51,002
I don't know why.

1315
01:03:51,803 --> 01:03:52,973
Shall we toast first?

1316
01:03:54,243 --> 01:03:55,842
I'll hold it with both hands since I'm feeling nervous.

1317
01:03:55,843 --> 01:03:56,843
- Really? - Yes.

1318
01:03:56,844 --> 01:03:58,172
Oh, dear.

1319
01:03:59,082 --> 01:04:00,143
A bit...

1320
01:04:03,853 --> 01:04:06,623
You seemed to have a lot on your mind yesterday.

1321
01:04:07,283 --> 01:04:09,953
I felt sorry for you for acting grumpy.

1322
01:04:10,623 --> 01:04:11,652
I...

1323
01:04:13,323 --> 01:04:14,993
couldn't get my mind off you.

1324
01:04:21,902 --> 01:04:24,832
That's why I asked to have a talk as soon as you opened your eyes.

1325
01:04:25,942 --> 01:04:27,103
I couldn't hear you properly.

1326
01:04:27,473 --> 01:04:29,812
- Really? When we talked? - Yes.

1327
01:04:29,942 --> 01:04:32,743
Actually, I was surprised when you asked to talk.

1328
01:04:33,013 --> 01:04:35,243
- Why? - I thought, "What should I do?"

1329
01:04:36,353 --> 01:04:37,612
My mind went blank.

1330
01:04:38,082 --> 01:04:40,053
- So we talked, and I went in early. - Really?

1331
01:04:40,183 --> 01:04:41,183
Yes.

1332
01:04:42,252 --> 01:04:43,652
It was hard seeing you.

1333
01:04:43,953 --> 01:04:46,993
Even though I talked with you, you were feeling down too.

1334
01:04:47,362 --> 01:04:48,362
- Yes. - So...

1335
01:04:48,522 --> 01:04:51,362
Yes, I was feeling down the whole day too.

1336
01:04:52,402 --> 01:04:53,763
"Did he understand me?"

1337
01:04:55,002 --> 01:04:56,603
I didn't, to be honest.

1338
01:04:57,002 --> 01:04:58,631
Because I was feeling nervous,

1339
01:04:58,632 --> 01:05:01,703
I couldn't really hear what she was saying.

1340
01:05:01,942 --> 01:05:03,872
We spent a lot of time together...

1341
01:05:03,873 --> 01:05:05,912
and talked a lot.

1342
01:05:05,913 --> 01:05:07,643
I think the depth...

1343
01:05:08,683 --> 01:05:09,852
is different.

1344
01:05:09,853 --> 01:05:13,652
I didn't understand her words properly.

1345
01:05:14,022 --> 01:05:15,453
You don't need to care about that.

1346
01:05:16,123 --> 01:05:18,251
- Why? - I'll do what I want,

1347
01:05:18,252 --> 01:05:19,763
and you should do what you want.

1348
01:05:20,223 --> 01:05:22,433
At this age, I'm used to getting rejected.

1349
01:05:23,263 --> 01:05:26,663
(He couldn't even tell her how he truly felt.)

1350
01:05:26,763 --> 01:05:28,332
I did want to ask,

1351
01:05:29,973 --> 01:05:32,402
but I was worried about not getting the answer that I wanted.

1352
01:05:32,672 --> 01:05:33,843
I see.

1353
01:05:35,672 --> 01:05:37,612
"If she seems to like someone else,"

1354
01:05:41,013 --> 01:05:42,812
"what kind of stance should I take?"

1355
01:05:43,053 --> 01:05:44,582
This was what I felt.

1356
01:05:44,752 --> 01:05:46,723
"I might not be chosen."

1357
01:05:47,053 --> 01:05:50,251
I suddenly had that thought when I opened my eyes.

1358
01:05:50,252 --> 01:05:51,393
- On the next day? - Yes.

1359
01:05:51,893 --> 01:05:53,763
- So I also... - Thursday must've been really fun.

1360
01:05:53,922 --> 01:05:56,062
- What? - Thursday must've been really fun.

1361
01:05:57,433 --> 01:05:58,832
You punk.

1362
01:05:59,433 --> 01:06:00,632
Was it that fun?

1363
01:06:01,402 --> 01:06:02,533
What did you do?

1364
01:06:03,873 --> 01:06:05,272
No, I...

1365
01:06:08,243 --> 01:06:09,412
I whined at her.

1366
01:06:09,413 --> 01:06:11,642
I thought about talking with her seriously,

1367
01:06:11,643 --> 01:06:13,612
but I didn't want to pressure her again.

1368
01:06:13,982 --> 01:06:16,183
Yun Ha laughed a lot.

1369
01:06:16,913 --> 01:06:19,981
Her laughing somewhat made me feel relieved.

1370
01:06:19,982 --> 01:06:21,381
- Why do you like it so much? - What?

1371
01:06:21,382 --> 01:06:22,852
Why are you smiling so brightly?

1372
01:06:22,853 --> 01:06:25,123
I'm so nervous I could die.

1373
01:06:25,763 --> 01:06:27,493
I smile even when I'm nervous.

1374
01:06:27,763 --> 01:06:28,893
- Really? - Yes.

1375
01:06:29,232 --> 01:06:30,993
It felt like everything crumbled.

1376
01:06:32,093 --> 01:06:33,103
- Really? - Yes.

1377
01:06:33,703 --> 01:06:36,033
- He likes her so much. - He's blinded by love.

1378
01:06:36,303 --> 01:06:39,373
That honesty is a charm.

1379
01:06:39,603 --> 01:06:42,002
"Did you have fun going on a date with that guy?"

1380
01:06:42,312 --> 01:06:44,042
"I thought I was going to die."

1381
01:06:44,172 --> 01:06:46,211
- Isn't that how you should talk? - That's right.

1382
01:06:46,212 --> 01:06:48,212
Do women like this kind of...

1383
01:06:48,482 --> 01:06:49,512
Of course.

1384
01:06:49,513 --> 01:06:50,553
- Okay. - Just...

1385
01:06:50,752 --> 01:06:51,852
He asked people on that side.

1386
01:06:51,853 --> 01:06:53,521
Is it Yong Woo or Yun Jae?

1387
01:06:53,522 --> 01:06:55,652
- I want to join them. - His head...

1388
01:06:55,752 --> 01:06:56,992
was turned to that side.

1389
01:06:56,993 --> 01:06:58,122
That side.

1390
01:06:58,123 --> 01:06:59,561
- Patricia, do you like that? - I'm just asking.

1391
01:06:59,562 --> 01:07:01,521
He expresses his feelings consistently...

1392
01:07:01,522 --> 01:07:02,961
and is honest all the time.

1393
01:07:02,962 --> 01:07:04,032
It's so nice.

1394
01:07:04,033 --> 01:07:06,862
But you don't know what will happen. I can't rest assured.

1395
01:07:07,933 --> 01:07:09,732
It felt like everything crumbled down.

1396
01:07:10,933 --> 01:07:12,002
- It did? - Yes.

1397
01:07:12,343 --> 01:07:13,402
I'm sorry.

1398
01:07:17,413 --> 01:07:20,881
You treated me as if you didn't know me.

1399
01:07:20,882 --> 01:07:22,482
No, it wasn't that bad.

1400
01:07:22,783 --> 01:07:24,211
It was that bad.

1401
01:07:24,212 --> 01:07:25,212
- Really? - Yes.

1402
01:07:25,213 --> 01:07:26,823
- That's why... - I'm sorry.

1403
01:07:27,922 --> 01:07:30,593
That's why I said I wanted to talk.

1404
01:07:32,323 --> 01:07:35,191
I thought you might choose Ju Yeon...

1405
01:07:35,192 --> 01:07:37,732
as you spent time with her that day.

1406
01:07:38,292 --> 01:07:40,362
- You did? - You drew a heart too.

1407
01:07:40,632 --> 01:07:42,732
I saw the heart.

1408
01:07:47,203 --> 01:07:49,473
You went to a beach.

1409
01:07:49,843 --> 01:07:52,581
(Yun Ha saw the picture of the heart they drew.)

1410
01:07:52,582 --> 01:07:54,881
I didn't know she saw the picture.

1411
01:07:54,882 --> 01:07:57,553
I had nothing more to say.

1412
01:07:58,053 --> 01:07:59,283
So I stayed quiet.

1413
01:08:00,223 --> 01:08:01,853
- I did wrong. - You didn't do...

1414
01:08:02,252 --> 01:08:04,021
something like that...

1415
01:08:04,022 --> 01:08:05,522
even though you went out on a date a lot with me.

1416
01:08:05,523 --> 01:08:07,193
But I always told you.

1417
01:08:08,263 --> 01:08:09,893
- I... - This is my view.

1418
01:08:13,032 --> 01:08:14,933
- That's why I'm so thankful. - Why?

1419
01:08:15,603 --> 01:08:17,331
You always express your feelings like this.

1420
01:08:17,332 --> 01:08:19,171
I'm not really good at it.

1421
01:08:19,172 --> 01:08:20,172
I know.

1422
01:08:20,443 --> 01:08:21,872
Please pay attention to me.

1423
01:08:22,202 --> 01:08:24,113
Did I not pay attention to you?

1424
01:08:24,973 --> 01:08:25,983
It's not enough.

1425
01:08:35,853 --> 01:08:37,593
You can't act so cute like that.

1426
01:08:42,863 --> 01:08:45,062
He said I rarely expressed my feelings...

1427
01:08:45,063 --> 01:08:46,532
and it made him upset.

1428
01:08:46,863 --> 01:08:48,603
He was complaining a little...

1429
01:08:49,973 --> 01:08:51,332
in a cute way.

1430
01:08:52,032 --> 01:08:54,372
I'm quite far from being cute.

1431
01:08:55,403 --> 01:08:57,443
But if that's one of the ways to win her heart,

1432
01:08:57,872 --> 01:08:59,943
I want to be cute.

1433
01:09:00,382 --> 01:09:01,983
- I thought about it. - Yes.

1434
01:09:03,082 --> 01:09:04,581
If you can't express your feelings, what can I do?

1435
01:09:04,582 --> 01:09:05,723
I should express my feelings more...

1436
01:09:06,582 --> 01:09:07,683
and ask for your attention.

1437
01:09:10,822 --> 01:09:12,053
Thank you so much.

1438
01:09:13,893 --> 01:09:16,263
I like men who like me.

1439
01:09:17,863 --> 01:09:19,063
It was the same for me.

1440
01:09:19,733 --> 01:09:21,132
It was more comfortable to be with someone who liked me.

1441
01:09:21,462 --> 01:09:23,233
That's why it's weird that I'm doing this.

1442
01:09:25,002 --> 01:09:26,943
- Fine. I... - I'll express more.

1443
01:09:27,672 --> 01:09:30,312
I have no choice. The one who loves more is at a disadvantage.

1444
01:09:30,313 --> 01:09:31,642
- What? - The one who loves more will do it.

1445
01:09:31,643 --> 01:09:32,911
- I have no choice. - "Disadvantage?"

1446
01:09:32,912 --> 01:09:34,812
(Screaming)

1447
01:09:34,813 --> 01:09:37,153
- His words... - His expression is...

1448
01:09:38,183 --> 01:09:39,853
Let us watch it one more time. Please play it again.

1449
01:09:41,223 --> 01:09:43,722
I have no choice. The one who loves more is at a disadvantage.

1450
01:09:43,723 --> 01:09:45,052
- What? - The one who loves more will do it.

1451
01:09:45,053 --> 01:09:46,162
I have no choice.

1452
01:09:49,363 --> 01:09:51,563
I was relieved again.

1453
01:09:51,733 --> 01:09:54,032
When I was anxious, I was avoiding her,

1454
01:09:54,803 --> 01:09:56,532
so I forgot how pretty she was.

1455
01:09:56,672 --> 01:09:59,542
But I could see...

1456
01:09:59,702 --> 01:10:01,943
how pretty, bright, and nice she was again,

1457
01:10:02,542 --> 01:10:03,772
which gave me assurance.

1458
01:10:03,773 --> 01:10:05,171
He's very mature.

1459
01:10:05,172 --> 01:10:07,313
I think he's a much better person than me.

1460
01:10:07,443 --> 01:10:08,881
I'm very clumsy...

1461
01:10:08,882 --> 01:10:10,612
and afraid to express myself.

1462
01:10:10,613 --> 01:10:13,683
You can tell how sincere Yun Jae is when you see his behaviour.

1463
01:10:13,752 --> 01:10:16,752
That's so admirable.

1464
01:10:17,422 --> 01:10:19,422
I didn't know I could be so proactive like this either.

1465
01:10:19,893 --> 01:10:20,922
Seriously.

1466
01:10:22,322 --> 01:10:25,592
People all ask me.

1467
01:10:25,593 --> 01:10:27,332
"Why are you so aggressive? Do you always take initiative?"

1468
01:10:28,632 --> 01:10:29,903
"I'm not like that."

1469
01:10:30,332 --> 01:10:32,371
- Who said it? The guys? - Everyone.

1470
01:10:32,372 --> 01:10:34,103
(Yun Ha and Yun Jae's Secret Date ended.)

1471
01:10:41,183 --> 01:10:44,483
(Ji Won's third Secret Date)

1472
01:11:22,322 --> 01:11:24,353
Ji Won was waiting.

1473
01:11:24,693 --> 01:11:27,062
(Ji Won and Jae Hyung's Secret Date)

1474
01:11:27,063 --> 01:11:28,692
This is important.

1475
01:11:28,693 --> 01:11:30,332
It's important. Very important.

1476
01:11:30,462 --> 01:11:32,162
I want to watch it behind the sofa.

1477
01:11:33,803 --> 01:11:35,562
- It's the first time. - I'm not mentally ready.

1478
01:11:35,563 --> 01:11:36,603
We are not ready.

1479
01:11:37,332 --> 01:11:38,403
Hi.

1480
01:11:42,242 --> 01:11:43,473
Did you wait for a long time?

1481
01:11:43,712 --> 01:11:45,172
I came just now.

1482
01:11:48,082 --> 01:11:49,653
Your eyes are white today.

1483
01:11:50,752 --> 01:11:51,952
Are they a little red?

1484
01:11:53,582 --> 01:11:54,922
They're a little red.

1485
01:11:56,292 --> 01:11:57,452
They're always red.

1486
01:11:58,622 --> 01:11:59,822
How was it?

1487
01:12:00,393 --> 01:12:02,662
- When? - From the beginning to the end.

1488
01:12:04,093 --> 01:12:08,461
I couldn't talk a lot with you in Seoul.

1489
01:12:08,462 --> 01:12:11,933
It was nice that I could go out with you in Singapore.

1490
01:12:16,072 --> 01:12:19,443
"I'm sad that this is over,"

1491
01:12:20,082 --> 01:12:22,212
"but I don't think I need more time here."

1492
01:12:22,782 --> 01:12:24,113
I think that's what I said.

1493
01:12:24,353 --> 01:12:28,152
As time went by,

1494
01:12:28,153 --> 01:12:30,223
I wish things were different.

1495
01:12:30,952 --> 01:12:35,933
I wish we could talk more in Seoul.

1496
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:41,632
That's what I kept thinking about.

1497
01:12:43,233 --> 01:12:48,302
I understand what you meant...

1498
01:12:48,303 --> 01:12:51,541
by wanting to have a proper conversation outside of Singapore.

1499
01:12:51,542 --> 01:12:53,741
But I think there would be many things...

1500
01:12:53,742 --> 01:12:59,382
we can learn about each other in Singapore too.

1501
01:13:00,353 --> 01:13:03,252
So I want to know...

1502
01:13:03,353 --> 01:13:06,491
what kind of person he is at least...

1503
01:13:06,492 --> 01:13:09,933
when I make a choice.

1504
01:13:13,603 --> 01:13:14,903
Thank you.

1505
01:13:19,072 --> 01:13:20,172
Thank you.

1506
01:13:21,202 --> 01:13:23,212
The atmosphere was very heavy.

1507
01:13:23,343 --> 01:13:26,711
I didn't know where to start and what to say.

1508
01:13:26,712 --> 01:13:29,853
I felt very awkward.

1509
01:13:31,813 --> 01:13:34,023
You said your feelings about me...

1510
01:13:34,483 --> 01:13:35,992
changed compared to when you saw me...

1511
01:13:37,553 --> 01:13:40,192
- for the first time. - Yes.

1512
01:13:40,193 --> 01:13:41,922
The image and the feelings.

1513
01:13:42,193 --> 01:13:44,063
How did your feelings...

1514
01:13:45,763 --> 01:13:48,502
about me change?

1515
01:13:49,603 --> 01:13:51,371
Isn't he almost whispering?

1516
01:13:51,372 --> 01:13:55,501
The tone of his voice is different from when he went out with others.

1517
01:13:55,502 --> 01:13:57,741
- When he has a serious... - Right.

1518
01:13:57,742 --> 01:14:00,982
and sincere conversation like that,

1519
01:14:00,983 --> 01:14:02,241
- he always whispers. - Right.

1520
01:14:02,242 --> 01:14:04,411
I hope his feelings will be conveyed to her.

1521
01:14:04,412 --> 01:14:05,683
Would she know?

1522
01:14:06,683 --> 01:14:08,422
How did your feelings...

1523
01:14:10,322 --> 01:14:12,962
about me change?

1524
01:14:13,723 --> 01:14:17,192
I didn't have any concern when I picked you for the first time.

1525
01:14:17,193 --> 01:14:21,363
I didn't think I wanted to go out with someone else.

1526
01:14:21,803 --> 01:14:25,102
I happened to lose the chicken fight,

1527
01:14:25,103 --> 01:14:28,603
I had the right to select my date.

1528
01:14:28,903 --> 01:14:30,071
I was so happy at that time.

1529
01:14:30,072 --> 01:14:33,812
"Is it my destiny to date him?" That's what I thought.

1530
01:14:33,813 --> 01:14:34,982
- Destiny? - Yes.

1531
01:14:34,983 --> 01:14:37,451
My faith in destiny was restored.

1532
01:14:37,452 --> 01:14:40,222
So I wanted to go out with you again without a second thought.

1533
01:14:40,223 --> 01:14:43,852
We laughed and had a lot of fun.

1534
01:14:43,853 --> 01:14:47,023
But it felt like we didn't talk much...

1535
01:14:47,563 --> 01:14:49,492
about serious matters...

1536
01:14:50,832 --> 01:14:52,063
in the Ferris wheel that day.

1537
01:14:56,672 --> 01:15:01,172
So you wish we talked more.

1538
01:15:01,343 --> 01:15:02,343
Yes.

1539
01:15:02,973 --> 01:15:05,143
Do you have any questions for me?

1540
01:15:06,082 --> 01:15:07,412
Questions for you?

1541
01:15:08,613 --> 01:15:10,983
Actually, I wonder if there would be another time...

1542
01:15:11,412 --> 01:15:15,382
for us to talk if we don't talk now.

1543
01:15:15,992 --> 01:15:19,662
This might be our last chance.

1544
01:15:20,223 --> 01:15:23,232
But it's difficult to get to know each other quickly...

1545
01:15:23,233 --> 01:15:24,932
just because...

1546
01:15:24,933 --> 01:15:26,631
this is our last chance.

1547
01:15:26,632 --> 01:15:29,232
That's true. You should do it at your own pace.

1548
01:15:29,233 --> 01:15:30,233
Yes.

1549
01:15:30,403 --> 01:15:33,002
The final decision...

1550
01:15:33,443 --> 01:15:36,273
isn't just like "I want to get to know about her more..."

1551
01:15:36,412 --> 01:15:40,581
"and talk with her without cameras."

1552
01:15:40,582 --> 01:15:41,613
I see.

1553
01:15:42,082 --> 01:15:45,752
I came here because I'm very serious about this.

1554
01:15:46,023 --> 01:15:47,053
Yes.

1555
01:15:47,223 --> 01:15:50,751
On the day of the contest, we texted each other.

1556
01:15:50,752 --> 01:15:51,821
Yes.

1557
01:15:51,822 --> 01:15:53,492
Actually,

1558
01:15:54,622 --> 01:15:56,332
that's when I fell hard for you.

1559
01:15:57,933 --> 01:16:00,733
It was like, "What?"

1560
01:16:01,662 --> 01:16:03,172
"Is she the one?"

1561
01:16:04,773 --> 01:16:05,832
Since I...

1562
01:16:07,502 --> 01:16:10,672
focused on this,

1563
01:16:11,343 --> 01:16:16,112
I've been quite sure about my feelings.

1564
01:16:16,113 --> 01:16:17,153
I see.

1565
01:16:18,313 --> 01:16:20,722
I'm a free-spirited person.

1566
01:16:20,723 --> 01:16:21,723
Yes.

1567
01:16:21,724 --> 01:16:23,693
But since I joined the show,

1568
01:16:24,153 --> 01:16:26,791
I haven't been like that. I think I care more than anyone.

1569
01:16:26,792 --> 01:16:28,893
And I feel uncomfortable more than anyone.

1570
01:16:32,702 --> 01:16:35,701
I hate how concerned I am.

1571
01:16:35,702 --> 01:16:36,702
I see.

1572
01:16:36,703 --> 01:16:39,202
When we were in the Ferris wheel,

1573
01:16:40,172 --> 01:16:43,572
- I was struggling. - Yes.

1574
01:16:45,242 --> 01:16:49,582
I couldn't enjoy the atmosphere naturally.

1575
01:16:51,252 --> 01:16:53,723
I wished it had been just the two of us.

1576
01:16:54,122 --> 01:16:57,121
I would've had a deep conversation then.

1577
01:16:57,122 --> 01:17:00,792
Because I was very sure about my feelings.

1578
01:17:01,693 --> 01:17:03,131
I totally understand him.

1579
01:17:03,132 --> 01:17:05,162
He was aware of the cameras.

1580
01:17:05,593 --> 01:17:08,131
It's not easy to date someone...

1581
01:17:08,132 --> 01:17:09,772
- in front of other people. - Right.

1582
01:17:09,773 --> 01:17:12,273
I think...

1583
01:17:12,603 --> 01:17:14,002
he's very careful.

1584
01:17:14,443 --> 01:17:16,812
- He became a lot more careful. - I know.

1585
01:17:16,813 --> 01:17:18,212
Now that you say it, it seems like it.

1586
01:17:18,343 --> 01:17:23,553
It's about relationships and love.

1587
01:17:23,912 --> 01:17:26,553
- Right. It's a private matter. - It's a sensitive...

1588
01:17:26,922 --> 01:17:29,251
and embarrassing matter in a way.

1589
01:17:29,252 --> 01:17:30,422
- Right. - Yes.

1590
01:17:30,653 --> 01:17:33,821
To explain what I felt in the Ferris wheel,

1591
01:17:33,822 --> 01:17:36,732
I still wanted to have a meaningful conversation...

1592
01:17:36,733 --> 01:17:39,291
at that time.

1593
01:17:39,292 --> 01:17:40,302
Right.

1594
01:17:40,303 --> 01:17:41,762
I think I tried...

1595
01:17:41,763 --> 01:17:43,201
- several times. - Right.

1596
01:17:43,202 --> 01:17:45,733
"What did you like?" I asked a question like this.

1597
01:17:46,202 --> 01:17:48,602
- But it seemed you couldn't... - Yes.

1598
01:17:48,603 --> 01:17:49,711
- focus. - You're right.

1599
01:17:49,712 --> 01:17:53,342
Actually, I had words on the tip of my tongue.

1600
01:17:53,343 --> 01:17:56,013
- But I couldn't say them. - You couldn't speak.

1601
01:17:56,483 --> 01:17:59,252
This is how I felt.

1602
01:18:00,183 --> 01:18:01,821
I wasn't sure if you acted like that because of the situation...

1603
01:18:01,822 --> 01:18:03,422
or because that's how you were.

1604
01:18:04,922 --> 01:18:08,893
It seemed you didn't want to talk about yourself.

1605
01:18:09,832 --> 01:18:14,262
I understood that it was an uncomfortable situation,

1606
01:18:14,263 --> 01:18:17,002
- but we didn't have much time. - Right.

1607
01:18:17,403 --> 01:18:18,902
I didn't know what to do.

1608
01:18:18,903 --> 01:18:20,371
Rather than feeling uncomfortable,

1609
01:18:20,372 --> 01:18:22,472
I was thinking.

1610
01:18:22,473 --> 01:18:23,473
It was like that.

1611
01:18:26,212 --> 01:18:29,682
"What's the prettiest thing you've seen since you came here?"

1612
01:18:29,683 --> 01:18:31,053
You asked this.

1613
01:18:31,282 --> 01:18:32,581
"The moon I saw yesterday was pretty."

1614
01:18:32,582 --> 01:18:34,052
- "The moon I saw with Cho A." - Right.

1615
01:18:34,053 --> 01:18:35,281
That's what I said.

1616
01:18:35,282 --> 01:18:39,393
But that's not what I actually wanted to say.

1617
01:18:42,292 --> 01:18:43,393
This is hard.

1618
01:18:45,763 --> 01:18:46,803
It's just...

1619
01:18:49,263 --> 01:18:52,372
When you asked me the question in the Ferris wheel,

1620
01:18:53,672 --> 01:18:56,943
what I really wanted to say was...

1621
01:18:58,813 --> 01:18:59,882
I was...

1622
01:19:07,553 --> 01:19:09,621
I was going to say it was you.

1623
01:19:09,622 --> 01:19:11,053
But...

1624
01:19:13,662 --> 01:19:14,962
It was so...

1625
01:19:19,393 --> 01:19:20,863
"Would I be able..."

1626
01:19:21,702 --> 01:19:24,202
"to have a conversation..."

1627
01:19:26,072 --> 01:19:28,172
"where I can know more about him..."

1628
01:19:29,072 --> 01:19:31,912
"if I go out with him one more time?"

1629
01:19:36,252 --> 01:19:37,612
"What kind of conversation..."

1630
01:19:37,613 --> 01:19:41,281
"did we not have?"

1631
01:19:41,282 --> 01:19:42,781
I was thinking about those things.

1632
01:19:42,782 --> 01:19:47,762
"Would it be better to talk more..."

1633
01:19:47,763 --> 01:19:52,832
"with someone who knows me better and has a deeper understanding..."

1634
01:19:52,962 --> 01:19:56,403
"about me at the end?"

1635
01:19:57,132 --> 01:19:58,672
That's what I thought.

1636
01:19:59,473 --> 01:20:02,242
I really don't know.

1637
01:20:02,912 --> 01:20:05,372
Now that we're talking about it...

1638
01:20:07,613 --> 01:20:09,312
(Gosh, it's not easy.)

1639
01:20:09,313 --> 01:20:10,782
It's not easy.

1640
01:20:12,412 --> 01:20:16,452
When I saw you at 1st, the 1st thing I thought was...

1641
01:20:19,922 --> 01:20:22,363
you were very similar...

1642
01:20:22,462 --> 01:20:23,491
Okay.

1643
01:20:23,492 --> 01:20:24,492
to someone who hurt me...

1644
01:20:25,162 --> 01:20:26,233
the most.

1645
01:20:26,933 --> 01:20:27,962
I see.

1646
01:20:28,603 --> 01:20:31,072
So I closed my heart when I saw you...

1647
01:20:31,832 --> 01:20:33,502
- for the first time. - I see.

1648
01:20:33,572 --> 01:20:35,872
You reminded me of the person so much when I saw you at first.

1649
01:20:35,973 --> 01:20:39,312
I was anxious every day when I was dating her.

1650
01:20:39,313 --> 01:20:41,412
I had a hard time because I couldn't trust her.

1651
01:20:43,813 --> 01:20:46,321
So I couldn't take a good look at you at first.

1652
01:20:46,322 --> 01:20:49,653
I couldn't take a close look at you.

1653
01:20:50,853 --> 01:20:53,393
That's why I thought...

1654
01:20:55,063 --> 01:20:57,832
"It's not going to work out with her."

1655
01:20:59,933 --> 01:21:01,602
But I felt...

1656
01:21:01,603 --> 01:21:04,233
you were different...

1657
01:21:04,502 --> 01:21:09,002
when I saw you at the contest.

1658
01:21:09,103 --> 01:21:12,942
I took a close look at your face and how you behaved.

1659
01:21:12,943 --> 01:21:16,112
The biggest impression I had at that time...

1660
01:21:16,113 --> 01:21:18,053
was that you were deep.

1661
01:21:19,683 --> 01:21:22,121
That's the moment that made me go,

1662
01:21:22,122 --> 01:21:25,193
"What's this?"

1663
01:21:26,922 --> 01:21:28,922
(Ji Won's new side...)

1664
01:21:30,292 --> 01:21:32,332
(moved his heart.)

1665
01:21:32,893 --> 01:21:37,772
(I was actually drawn to her.)

1666
01:21:37,773 --> 01:21:40,143
When I think someone is mine,

1667
01:21:40,343 --> 01:21:42,742
she becomes my priority.

1668
01:21:43,513 --> 01:21:45,812
The moment I'm certain...

1669
01:21:45,813 --> 01:21:48,081
that she's mine,

1670
01:21:48,082 --> 01:21:51,411
I treat her like a baby. Did I say this?

1671
01:21:51,412 --> 01:21:52,451
Yes.

1672
01:21:52,452 --> 01:21:54,022
I want to be taken care of...

1673
01:21:54,023 --> 01:21:55,582
as if I were a puppy.

1674
01:21:56,622 --> 01:21:58,852
If I love, cherish,

1675
01:21:58,853 --> 01:22:00,792
and adore someone...

1676
01:22:00,962 --> 01:22:03,432
only to find out...

1677
01:22:03,433 --> 01:22:04,832
that she doesn't feel the same,

1678
01:22:06,763 --> 01:22:10,201
I think I will close my heart.

1679
01:22:10,202 --> 01:22:13,303
That's why I can't express my feelings well.

1680
01:22:13,473 --> 01:22:15,502
- You're a coward. - Yes.

1681
01:22:15,603 --> 01:22:18,013
I'm a coward. I'm timid.

1682
01:22:18,742 --> 01:22:21,211
"Does Ji Won feel uncomfortable around me?"

1683
01:22:21,212 --> 01:22:24,882
"Was she just curious about me?"

1684
01:22:25,752 --> 01:22:29,282
"Or did she think I was different..."

1685
01:22:31,752 --> 01:22:33,962
"from what she had thought..."

1686
01:22:34,462 --> 01:22:36,162
"after going out with me?"

1687
01:22:36,322 --> 01:22:40,432
"We didn't make..."

1688
01:22:40,433 --> 01:22:42,602
"the final decision yet."

1689
01:22:42,603 --> 01:22:45,532
"So when someone else catches your eye,"

1690
01:22:45,672 --> 01:22:48,702
"you could be drawn to him more."

1691
01:22:49,202 --> 01:22:50,572
"Is that why she's acting like that?" That's what I thought.

1692
01:22:50,973 --> 01:22:54,183
Before I came here, I thought...

1693
01:22:54,813 --> 01:22:58,613
I should make a different decision this time.

1694
01:22:59,252 --> 01:23:01,121
But at some point,

1695
01:23:01,122 --> 01:23:03,991
I was drawn to someone I could just laugh, enjoy,

1696
01:23:03,992 --> 01:23:06,522
and have a good time together...

1697
01:23:06,523 --> 01:23:09,562
as I always was.

1698
01:23:09,563 --> 01:23:13,332
It got me thinking about many things.

1699
01:23:13,803 --> 01:23:17,202
"If I were to make another choice, what could it be?"

1700
01:23:20,603 --> 01:23:24,513
I contemplated like that yesterday.

1701
01:23:28,483 --> 01:23:31,813
- Why do I feel so bad about him? - I know.

1702
01:23:32,013 --> 01:23:34,082
He doesn't know she went out with Yong Woo.

1703
01:23:34,322 --> 01:23:35,421
- Right. - He doesn't know.

1704
01:23:35,422 --> 01:23:36,451
He thinks...

1705
01:23:36,452 --> 01:23:38,251
she was contemplating...

1706
01:23:38,252 --> 01:23:40,063
- only because of him. - Right.

1707
01:23:41,263 --> 01:23:42,322
This is hard.

1708
01:23:43,093 --> 01:23:44,532
- Sorry? - This is tough.

1709
01:23:45,593 --> 01:23:48,162
You always tell me about your feelings belatedly.

1710
01:23:48,632 --> 01:23:51,071
Like how I gave you the magnet.

1711
01:23:51,072 --> 01:23:52,103
Yes.

1712
01:23:52,372 --> 01:23:53,701
"You shouldn't have lost."

1713
01:23:53,702 --> 01:23:55,002
Then you gave me the magnet.

1714
01:23:55,343 --> 01:23:56,843
"The moon is pretty."

1715
01:23:57,813 --> 01:24:00,082
"That's not what I wanted to say."

1716
01:24:05,113 --> 01:24:08,882
If I had been with someone else,

1717
01:24:09,223 --> 01:24:12,292
I would've answered without hesitation.

1718
01:24:12,593 --> 01:24:14,193
"You're the prettiest."

1719
01:24:14,593 --> 01:24:15,693
"You look pretty today."

1720
01:24:16,023 --> 01:24:17,661
That's what I'm talking about.

1721
01:24:17,662 --> 01:24:21,002
I want to meet someone...

1722
01:24:21,433 --> 01:24:23,232
- Someone who treats you well? - who says nice things...

1723
01:24:23,233 --> 01:24:25,733
to someone he loves.

1724
01:24:28,542 --> 01:24:32,643
But how did I end up liking someone like my brother?

1725
01:24:33,483 --> 01:24:34,612
You're even worse than him.

1726
01:24:34,613 --> 01:24:36,853
You saw how my brother was acting, right?

1727
01:24:37,983 --> 01:24:41,582
It seemed...

1728
01:24:41,683 --> 01:24:44,053
you were sweet to others.

1729
01:24:44,252 --> 01:24:45,252
But, my goodness,

1730
01:24:45,253 --> 01:24:48,363
you were so sassy with me.

1731
01:24:48,763 --> 01:24:51,193
I'm not sassy. I'm just shy.

1732
01:24:51,563 --> 01:24:53,332
- You're shy. - Yes.

1733
01:24:55,763 --> 01:24:59,201
I think I expressed my honest feelings...

1734
01:24:59,202 --> 01:25:01,041
and how certain I was...

1735
01:25:01,042 --> 01:25:03,742
during the Secret Date.

1736
01:25:04,042 --> 01:25:06,411
There would be something...

1737
01:25:06,412 --> 01:25:10,211
we learned through this conversation.

1738
01:25:10,212 --> 01:25:13,421
Even if you think you got to learn a new side of someone,

1739
01:25:13,422 --> 01:25:15,353
it might not be true.

1740
01:25:16,483 --> 01:25:18,222
You should just...

1741
01:25:18,223 --> 01:25:21,693
trust your feelings...

1742
01:25:21,922 --> 01:25:24,631
- and make a decision... - Right.

1743
01:25:24,632 --> 01:25:26,531
based on that.

1744
01:25:26,532 --> 01:25:28,232
I think I'll be contemplating the most today...

1745
01:25:28,233 --> 01:25:31,403
to solve the problem...

1746
01:25:32,532 --> 01:25:34,501
I have.

1747
01:25:34,502 --> 01:25:39,313
I think I'm going to have many thoughts tonight.

1748
01:25:39,443 --> 01:25:44,212
So for now,

1749
01:25:44,412 --> 01:25:48,322
there's nothing more I can say.

1750
01:25:53,492 --> 01:25:54,893
I really don't know.

1751
01:25:56,363 --> 01:26:00,001
It feels like the last mountain we should climb.

1752
01:26:00,002 --> 01:26:05,233
It's the very last mountain we should climb.

1753
01:26:05,433 --> 01:26:08,143
I think you and I, and everyone else...

1754
01:26:08,403 --> 01:26:10,273
would feel the same way.

1755
01:26:11,072 --> 01:26:13,683
The time we spent here...

1756
01:26:14,613 --> 01:26:17,653
feels heavier than the one in Seoul.

1757
01:26:17,853 --> 01:26:20,853
A big mountain? Everyone might be climbing one.

1758
01:26:24,023 --> 01:26:27,462
Let's climb the big mountain safely.

1759
01:26:46,042 --> 01:26:47,483
Are you looking for something to tease me about?

1760
01:27:06,363 --> 01:27:08,702
(The Secret Date ended.)

1761
01:27:10,172 --> 01:27:13,002
I'll get going.

1762
01:27:13,332 --> 01:27:17,042
It's not like we're saying goodbye here. We're going home.

1763
01:27:17,273 --> 01:27:19,071
We should see each other at home later.

1764
01:27:19,072 --> 01:27:20,983
- I'll get going first. - Okay.

1765
01:27:22,943 --> 01:27:24,582
- See you later, Jae Hyung. - See you.

1766
01:27:27,553 --> 01:27:29,482
- Would you like to eat this? - You want me to eat this?

1767
01:27:29,483 --> 01:27:32,223
- Yes. Just eat one before you go. - You eat it too.

1768
01:27:33,662 --> 01:27:34,962
It's interesting.

1769
01:27:38,962 --> 01:27:39,962
What kind of taste is this?

1770
01:27:41,632 --> 01:27:43,332
I think it's for a gourmet.

1771
01:27:44,903 --> 01:27:46,631
- See you later. - Yes.

1772
01:27:46,632 --> 01:27:49,072
You're not going to eat ramyeon later, right?

1773
01:27:53,882 --> 01:27:55,983
(Ji Won leaves first.)

1774
01:28:01,153 --> 01:28:04,523
I wished we had more time to talk.

1775
01:28:08,363 --> 01:28:09,692
I thought she felt better...

1776
01:28:09,693 --> 01:28:12,893
after listening to what I said.

1777
01:28:13,032 --> 01:28:14,932
"He talked about his feelings."

1778
01:28:14,933 --> 01:28:17,472
"He's someone I can share my feelings with."

1779
01:28:17,473 --> 01:28:19,302
It seemed she thought like that.

1780
01:28:19,303 --> 01:28:21,943
So I was assured when I was talking.

1781
01:28:31,513 --> 01:28:35,382
I think she was very confused...

1782
01:28:35,523 --> 01:28:38,791
because she didn't have a chance to get to know me properly.

1783
01:28:38,792 --> 01:28:42,421
It felt like that's why she was having a lot of thoughts.

1784
01:28:42,422 --> 01:28:45,392
What I wanted to say in the Ferris wheel...

1785
01:28:45,393 --> 01:28:47,161
was that I was happy to see her...

1786
01:28:47,162 --> 01:28:48,863
and she was the prettiest.

1787
01:28:48,903 --> 01:28:51,432
It was on the tip of my tongue,

1788
01:28:51,433 --> 01:28:53,131
but it's so hard for me...

1789
01:28:53,132 --> 01:28:55,741
to say things like that to her.

1790
01:28:55,742 --> 01:28:58,812
I didn't have the courage to say those things.

1791
01:28:58,813 --> 01:29:02,281
I talked about it directly,

1792
01:29:02,282 --> 01:29:05,052
which put us at ease.

1793
01:29:05,053 --> 01:29:07,152
We said we should climb...

1794
01:29:07,153 --> 01:29:09,222
a big mountain by tomorrow.

1795
01:29:09,223 --> 01:29:10,893
I was very sincere.

1796
01:29:11,122 --> 01:29:15,292
I think we're both going in the same direction.

1797
01:29:18,492 --> 01:29:20,563
I haven't made any decision yet.

1798
01:29:20,962 --> 01:29:25,032
I got to talk a lot with Jae Hyung for the first time.

1799
01:29:25,273 --> 01:29:27,242
This is so hard for me.

1800
01:29:38,013 --> 01:29:41,023
Please show us Yong Woo.

1801
01:29:44,853 --> 01:29:45,922
It's Yong Woo, right?

1802
01:29:57,072 --> 01:30:00,072
Please show us Yong Woo.

1803
01:30:03,872 --> 01:30:04,943
It's Yong Woo, right?

1804
01:30:05,643 --> 01:30:07,142
- The bag is... - I'm dizzy.

1805
01:30:07,143 --> 01:30:09,212
He's going for a house call.

1806
01:30:09,343 --> 01:30:10,982
He's going for a house call.

1807
01:30:10,983 --> 01:30:12,482
- It's like... - A house call for love.

1808
01:30:12,483 --> 01:30:14,282
He doesn't have sand on his shoes.

1809
01:30:15,322 --> 01:30:16,523
Even when it's raining so much.

1810
01:30:17,023 --> 01:30:18,122
Are they shoes with special functions?

1811
01:30:38,443 --> 01:30:41,843
(The person who asked him out on a Secret Date)

1812
01:30:47,122 --> 01:30:50,052
He hadn't sent me a text...

1813
01:30:50,053 --> 01:30:51,722
before he texted me again.

1814
01:30:51,723 --> 01:30:54,393
I wanted to check how his mind has changed.

1815
01:30:54,662 --> 01:30:57,233
I also wanted to check my feelings.

1816
01:31:02,502 --> 01:31:03,563
Hi.

1817
01:31:04,072 --> 01:31:05,172
Hi.

1818
01:31:05,403 --> 01:31:07,171
- Hi. - Hi.

1819
01:31:07,172 --> 01:31:09,472
He always smiles,

1820
01:31:09,473 --> 01:31:13,443
but that smile didn't seem so bright to me.

1821
01:31:15,212 --> 01:31:16,842
How was your day?

1822
01:31:16,843 --> 01:31:17,853
Sorry?

1823
01:31:18,813 --> 01:31:20,452
- How was your day? - Today?

1824
01:31:21,183 --> 01:31:23,052
It was stormy today.

1825
01:31:23,053 --> 01:31:24,192
- I see. - It rained a lot.

1826
01:31:24,193 --> 01:31:25,752
- It thundered too. - You're talking about the weather?

1827
01:31:26,693 --> 01:31:28,862
Both the weather and me.

1828
01:31:28,863 --> 01:31:30,162
- Is that so? - Yes.

1829
01:31:30,532 --> 01:31:32,161
Today was a meaningful day.

1830
01:31:32,162 --> 01:31:33,461
I see.

1831
01:31:33,462 --> 01:31:35,532
- How was your day? - Me?

1832
01:31:36,933 --> 01:31:39,072
If I were to make a weather analogy,

1833
01:31:39,502 --> 01:31:43,973
I'd say it was a little cloudy.

1834
01:31:44,542 --> 01:31:45,542
It's better than mine.

1835
01:31:46,672 --> 01:31:47,982
- Is it? - Yes.

1836
01:31:47,983 --> 01:31:49,782
Really? Was your day that bad?

1837
01:31:53,452 --> 01:31:56,822
I wanted to know what your text yesterday meant.

1838
01:31:58,023 --> 01:31:59,053
Well...

1839
01:32:02,462 --> 01:32:03,492
It literally meant...

1840
01:32:04,462 --> 01:32:06,733
it was the best peach...

1841
01:32:07,032 --> 01:32:10,302
I've ever had.

1842
01:32:10,303 --> 01:32:11,973
That's what it meant?

1843
01:32:12,603 --> 01:32:14,201
I hate to say this,

1844
01:32:14,202 --> 01:32:16,342
but it was like a goodbye.

1845
01:32:16,343 --> 01:32:17,912
- Is that so? - Yes.

1846
01:32:19,672 --> 01:32:22,382
So you made up your mind to some extent.

1847
01:32:23,582 --> 01:32:24,582
Right?

1848
01:32:24,583 --> 01:32:27,882
- It was very hard, but I did. - Yes.

1849
01:32:28,153 --> 01:32:29,223
You did?

1850
01:32:30,322 --> 01:32:31,822
Okay.

1851
01:32:32,322 --> 01:32:35,263
It felt like my heart dropped.

1852
01:32:36,492 --> 01:32:39,992
He didn't say...

1853
01:32:40,233 --> 01:32:43,402
his mind changed completely.

1854
01:32:43,403 --> 01:32:46,671
So I thought we would talk more about us...

1855
01:32:46,672 --> 01:32:48,803
when I went there.

1856
01:32:50,303 --> 01:32:52,313
But he said it firmly...

1857
01:32:52,572 --> 01:32:55,343
that he came to say goodbye.

1858
01:32:56,242 --> 01:32:58,082
It hurt me again.

1859
01:32:59,183 --> 01:33:02,251
He shouldn't have sent me the message then.

1860
01:33:02,252 --> 01:33:06,622
If he had changed his mind, he shouldn't have texted me again.

1861
01:33:06,723 --> 01:33:10,322
I don't know why he made me want to check again.

1862
01:33:17,903 --> 01:33:21,473
(All Secret Dates ended.)

1863
01:33:26,973 --> 01:33:32,553
(South Bridge)

1864
01:33:43,563 --> 01:33:44,732
Thank you.

1865
01:33:44,733 --> 01:33:48,632
(The siblings are gathering after the Secret Date.)

1866
01:33:58,172 --> 01:34:01,343
(Cheol Hyeon arrived first.)

1867
01:34:01,412 --> 01:34:02,513
Let's see.

1868
01:34:30,943 --> 01:34:31,973
Gosh.

1869
01:34:41,782 --> 01:34:43,321
- Are you the first one to arrive? - What?

1870
01:34:43,322 --> 01:34:45,592
- Did you arrive here first? - Yes, I arrived here first.

1871
01:34:45,593 --> 01:34:46,652
Did you have fun?

1872
01:34:46,653 --> 01:34:48,892
Today? Today was nice.

1873
01:34:48,893 --> 01:34:52,233
You and I know we didn't go on a date together.

1874
01:34:52,332 --> 01:34:53,332
Right.

1875
01:34:54,202 --> 01:34:55,403
Were you able to organize your thoughts?

1876
01:34:56,332 --> 01:34:57,872
- Yes. - Really?

1877
01:34:58,072 --> 01:34:59,802
I asked what I'd been wanting to ask.

1878
01:34:59,803 --> 01:35:00,903
I see.

1879
01:35:01,672 --> 01:35:02,843
Do you think you had a nice talk?

1880
01:35:04,613 --> 01:35:06,342
- Yes. - You look unhappy.

1881
01:35:06,343 --> 01:35:07,412
Me?

1882
01:35:10,483 --> 01:35:11,483
Is there a lot on your mind?

1883
01:35:12,412 --> 01:35:13,882
I think the rain today...

1884
01:35:14,752 --> 01:35:16,322
is making me feel down.

1885
01:35:16,723 --> 01:35:18,353
And I'm sad that tomorrow is the last day.

1886
01:35:19,452 --> 01:35:20,492
Right.

1887
01:35:33,943 --> 01:35:36,972
- Gosh, baby. - Goodness. Hello.

1888
01:35:36,973 --> 01:35:38,013
What's up?

1889
01:35:38,343 --> 01:35:40,312
Gosh, I missed you guys.

1890
01:35:40,313 --> 01:35:41,812
- You missed us? - Yes.

1891
01:35:41,813 --> 01:35:42,843
Come here.

1892
01:35:43,882 --> 01:35:46,412
- You chose a difficult way. - I chose a difficult way.

1893
01:35:46,582 --> 01:35:47,782
Like my life.

1894
01:35:49,023 --> 01:35:50,752
- You too? Me too. - Me too.

1895
01:35:54,292 --> 01:35:55,692
- Hi. - You're here.

1896
01:35:55,693 --> 01:35:57,233
- When did you get here? - Sit here.

1897
01:35:57,433 --> 01:35:58,491
I see.

1898
01:35:58,492 --> 01:36:01,433
- Cho A, I missed you. - Me too.

1899
01:36:01,903 --> 01:36:04,032
- Did you have a good talk? - Yes, well...

1900
01:36:07,903 --> 01:36:09,172
I can't keep a straight face.

1901
01:36:09,843 --> 01:36:11,443
- Because it was that good? - Yes.

1902
01:36:24,393 --> 01:36:25,422
Hey.

1903
01:36:26,223 --> 01:36:28,223
- You're here. - Hi.

1904
01:36:30,322 --> 01:36:31,433
Hello.

1905
01:36:33,233 --> 01:36:35,433
- Sit here. Leave a seat in between. - Yes, sit here.

1906
01:36:36,702 --> 01:36:37,773
When did you get here?

1907
01:36:38,032 --> 01:36:40,032
- I just got here. - You just got here?

1908
01:36:50,042 --> 01:36:51,053
What?

1909
01:36:59,922 --> 01:37:01,063
- Hi. - Hello.

1910
01:37:01,322 --> 01:37:02,723
- Come here. - Sit here.

1911
01:37:05,263 --> 01:37:06,332
What's going on?

1912
01:37:14,502 --> 01:37:15,973
Gosh.

1913
01:37:24,483 --> 01:37:25,752
- It's Yong Woo. - Yong Woo's here.

1914
01:37:26,353 --> 01:37:27,382
It's Yong Woo.

1915
01:37:27,582 --> 01:37:30,622
I felt suddenly uncomfortable and nervous.

1916
01:37:32,922 --> 01:37:34,992
That's the kind of person I should be with.

1917
01:37:35,462 --> 01:37:36,991
- You're here. - Hello.

1918
01:37:36,992 --> 01:37:38,592
- Yong Woo. - Hi. H. I.

1919
01:37:38,593 --> 01:37:40,961
- Yong Woo, sit here. - Hi.

1920
01:37:40,962 --> 01:37:42,832
- Siblings have to sit together. - Okay.

1921
01:37:43,532 --> 01:37:44,572
Excuse me.

1922
01:37:46,733 --> 01:37:48,242
- Gosh. - I wondered how you'd get inside.

1923
01:37:49,643 --> 01:37:52,041
I couldn't keep a straight face.

1924
01:37:52,042 --> 01:37:55,912
I wasn't sure how I should behave...

1925
01:37:56,412 --> 01:37:58,552
in that situation.

1926
01:37:58,553 --> 01:38:00,582
I think I kept avoiding making eye contact with him.

1927
01:38:01,622 --> 01:38:02,922
You're the fish I caught earlier.

1928
01:38:03,082 --> 01:38:04,723
We meet again.

1929
01:38:11,662 --> 01:38:13,991
I was on the move all day, so I have a shadow now.

1930
01:38:13,992 --> 01:38:15,562
Yun Jae's going to have a lot too.

1931
01:38:15,563 --> 01:38:17,062
Yun Jae is pale too.

1932
01:38:17,063 --> 01:38:18,103
Right. So it shows up here...

1933
01:38:19,502 --> 01:38:20,532
like dots.

1934
01:38:20,843 --> 01:38:22,973
(Right then, Dottie is on his way.)

1935
01:38:26,843 --> 01:38:27,943
Where... Is this it?

1936
01:38:29,313 --> 01:38:32,053
(Yun Jae marches forward with a faulty umbrella.)

1937
01:38:39,122 --> 01:38:40,193
South...

1938
01:38:41,962 --> 01:38:43,863
(He's struggling.)

1939
01:38:47,863 --> 01:38:48,933
Everyone's here.

1940
01:38:49,702 --> 01:38:50,773
He's here.

1941
01:38:52,233 --> 01:38:53,233
Hi.

1942
01:38:53,234 --> 01:38:54,973
Let's take a look at his five o'clock shadow.

1943
01:38:55,872 --> 01:38:57,472
He does have a five o'clock shadow.

1944
01:38:57,473 --> 01:38:59,072
(He's looking at Yun Jae's five o'clock shadow.)

1945
01:38:59,542 --> 01:39:00,982
Move this chair back...

1946
01:39:00,983 --> 01:39:02,312
- and sit here. - Over here?

1947
01:39:02,313 --> 01:39:04,411
The chairs are slightly overlapped,

1948
01:39:04,412 --> 01:39:06,152
so push that one away.

1949
01:39:06,153 --> 01:39:07,251
Do siblings have to sit together?

1950
01:39:07,252 --> 01:39:08,952
Yes. Cho A went to the restroom.

1951
01:39:10,523 --> 01:39:11,622
You have a piece of lint here.

1952
01:39:13,523 --> 01:39:14,693
I really needed to eat.

1953
01:39:17,093 --> 01:39:18,893
I found peace.

1954
01:39:20,632 --> 01:39:22,803
- Congrats. - And something changed too.

1955
01:39:23,202 --> 01:39:24,372
That's quite interesting.

1956
01:39:24,832 --> 01:39:27,642
We might not be able to share who we went on dates with,

1957
01:39:27,643 --> 01:39:30,042
regardless of that, did you have a nice talk?

1958
01:39:30,912 --> 01:39:32,143
- Yes. - I see.

1959
01:39:35,712 --> 01:39:36,741
- Hi. - Hi.

1960
01:39:36,742 --> 01:39:38,411
- Yun Ha. - Hi.

1961
01:39:38,412 --> 01:39:39,881
- Hi. Hello. - Hello.

1962
01:39:39,882 --> 01:39:41,082
Hi.

1963
01:39:41,882 --> 01:39:43,122
I see.

1964
01:39:43,252 --> 01:39:44,252
Hi.

1965
01:39:44,292 --> 01:39:45,922
- Hi. - Hi.

1966
01:39:47,393 --> 01:39:48,763
Long time no see.

1967
01:39:50,263 --> 01:39:51,862
- Hi. - Hi.

1968
01:39:51,863 --> 01:39:53,492
What? Am I the last one to arrive?

1969
01:40:04,973 --> 01:40:08,142
- Jae Hyung noticed... - Jae Hyung noticed right away.

1970
01:40:08,143 --> 01:40:09,512
- You saw him notice, right? - His sister...

1971
01:40:09,513 --> 01:40:11,881
- Siblings are special. - Right.

1972
01:40:11,882 --> 01:40:13,582
They notice right away.

1973
01:40:15,622 --> 01:40:18,122
Se Seung didn't meet my eyes.

1974
01:40:18,593 --> 01:40:20,862
I didn't want to talk at all.

1975
01:40:20,863 --> 01:40:22,523
It was the worst.

1976
01:40:22,792 --> 01:40:26,262
It seemed like she had a change of heart.

1977
01:40:26,263 --> 01:40:28,532
So I thought something must have happened today.

1978
01:40:39,143 --> 01:40:41,212
What did you do? Are we not allowed to talk about it?

1979
01:40:41,782 --> 01:40:42,813
No, we're not.

1980
01:40:43,042 --> 01:40:46,381
Since we all didn't know who went...

1981
01:40:46,382 --> 01:40:47,822
on a secret date with who,

1982
01:40:48,023 --> 01:40:49,821
there was this kind of...

1983
01:40:49,822 --> 01:40:52,553
unidentifiable tension in the air.

1984
01:40:53,153 --> 01:40:54,462
- What? - What?

1985
01:40:54,563 --> 01:40:55,762
- What? - Gosh.

1986
01:40:55,763 --> 01:40:57,121
- Gosh. - Goodness.

1987
01:40:57,122 --> 01:40:59,131
- It's thick. - It's very thick.

1988
01:40:59,132 --> 01:41:00,193
What could it be?

1989
01:41:00,792 --> 01:41:02,331
You read it, Ju Yeon.

1990
01:41:02,332 --> 01:41:03,831
I'll unseal it.

1991
01:41:03,832 --> 01:41:05,072
- Okay. - I'll open it.

1992
01:41:10,803 --> 01:41:12,912
"One day before the final decision."

1993
01:41:13,242 --> 01:41:15,182
"For the final decision,"

1994
01:41:15,183 --> 01:41:17,852
"we'll play Siblings' Truth or Dare starting now."

1995
01:41:17,853 --> 01:41:19,752
- Gosh. - Gosh.

1996
01:41:20,582 --> 01:41:21,882
- Gosh. - Gosh.

1997
01:41:25,452 --> 01:41:26,991
(You have 1 day before making the final decision.)

1998
01:41:26,992 --> 01:41:28,222
(For the final decision,)

1999
01:41:28,223 --> 01:41:30,263
(we'll play Siblings' Truth or Dare starting now.)

2000
01:41:30,563 --> 01:41:32,092
(You have to come up with every question with your sibling.)

2001
01:41:32,093 --> 01:41:33,791
(You have three opportunities to ask questions.)

2002
01:41:33,792 --> 01:41:38,531
(Your sibling has to ask questions for two of them.)

2003
01:41:38,532 --> 01:41:43,242
(You may ask a question yourself only once.)

2004
01:41:43,343 --> 01:41:44,372
Gosh.

2005
01:41:44,572 --> 01:41:48,313
So they have to ask questions after discussing it with their siblings?

2006
01:41:48,813 --> 01:41:51,352
- Their siblings ask for them? - Really?

2007
01:41:51,353 --> 01:41:54,582
"We will now let you know your feelings and dilemmas..."

2008
01:41:55,122 --> 01:41:56,752
"related to the final decision."

2009
01:41:56,952 --> 01:42:00,292
"I want to be an actual couple right after the final decision."

2010
01:42:00,523 --> 01:42:02,462
- Gosh, five people? - Five people?

2011
01:42:02,593 --> 01:42:03,863
- Five people? - Five people?

2012
01:42:05,162 --> 01:42:06,532
Five people?

2013
01:42:06,662 --> 01:42:08,132
- Gosh. - Right.

2014
01:42:08,233 --> 01:42:09,532
- Five people? - And then...

2015
01:42:11,303 --> 01:42:14,343
"I'm still conflicted about my final decision." Four people.

2016
01:42:14,473 --> 01:42:15,672
- Four people? - Four people.

2017
01:42:15,903 --> 01:42:18,472
There are five people who want to be actual couples.

2018
01:42:18,473 --> 01:42:20,572
And then there are those four people.

2019
01:42:20,672 --> 01:42:21,942
- Who's the remaining one, then? - The remaining one person...

2020
01:42:21,943 --> 01:42:23,241
I guess that person doesn't know.

2021
01:42:23,242 --> 01:42:24,652
Or they're sure about their final decision,

2022
01:42:24,653 --> 01:42:26,881
but they don't want to become an actual couple.

2023
01:42:26,882 --> 01:42:27,921
- That's it, though. - Is it?

2024
01:42:27,922 --> 01:42:29,052
I see.

2025
01:42:29,053 --> 01:42:31,992
"You have to answer every question truthfully,"

2026
01:42:32,223 --> 01:42:33,852
"and you can't pass any question."

2027
01:42:33,853 --> 01:42:35,363
- We're not allowed to pass? - We can't pass.

2028
01:42:35,563 --> 01:42:36,892
- Gosh. - Gosh.

2029
01:42:36,893 --> 01:42:39,762
I think there are two sides to Truth and Dare.

2030
01:42:39,763 --> 01:42:41,802
One is asking what I want to know.

2031
01:42:41,803 --> 01:42:45,433
The other is revealing a truth about myself.

2032
01:42:45,532 --> 01:42:49,273
I was determined to play this game...

2033
01:42:49,572 --> 01:42:51,813
to reveal the truth about myself.

2034
01:42:52,013 --> 01:42:54,382
I wanted to express my feelings to Ji Won.

2035
01:42:54,643 --> 01:42:57,712
And I wanted to let the others know how I feel too.

2036
01:42:58,113 --> 01:42:59,852
I think I felt that way...

2037
01:42:59,853 --> 01:43:01,752
because there wasn't much time left.

2038
01:43:02,183 --> 01:43:03,252
Gosh.

2039
01:43:04,693 --> 01:43:06,352
- He's entering the battle. - I'm so scared.

2040
01:43:06,353 --> 01:43:07,392
- Gosh. - Gosh.

2041
01:43:07,393 --> 01:43:09,162
Se Seung is going to be surprised too.

2042
01:43:09,322 --> 01:43:10,491
"It wasn't me?"

2043
01:43:10,492 --> 01:43:12,161
Everyone is in for a surprise.

2044
01:43:12,162 --> 01:43:13,893
They're all going to be shocked.

2045
01:43:14,803 --> 01:43:17,233
This is war.

2046
01:43:17,403 --> 01:43:19,702
I was nervous,

2047
01:43:20,572 --> 01:43:22,102
and I felt dejected because...

2048
01:43:22,103 --> 01:43:24,943
the truth was going to come out...

2049
01:43:25,042 --> 01:43:27,072
of his mouth.

2050
01:43:27,242 --> 01:43:30,682
I was worried that things wouldn't go back...

2051
01:43:30,683 --> 01:43:32,652
to how they were before,

2052
01:43:32,653 --> 01:43:34,212
that it would all be real.

2053
01:43:36,122 --> 01:43:39,153
I was honestly not sure what kind of questions to ask...

2054
01:43:39,252 --> 01:43:41,563
or what kind of questions I would have to answer.

2055
01:43:41,723 --> 01:43:44,631
I was so scared about the question Yong Woo could ask me.

2056
01:43:44,632 --> 01:43:46,592
I was like, "Why on earth would he like me?"

2057
01:43:46,593 --> 01:43:49,502
I was so distressed.

2058
01:43:50,032 --> 01:43:53,371
I could tell Jung Sub had a lot on his mind.

2059
01:43:53,372 --> 01:43:57,302
Since I was sure about my own feelings now,

2060
01:43:57,303 --> 01:44:00,512
I wanted to ask questions to check...

2061
01:44:00,513 --> 01:44:01,983
how she felt.

2062
01:44:02,183 --> 01:44:06,813
I think that time was very difficult for me.

2063
01:44:08,882 --> 01:44:11,692
I was very curious about when it all began...

2064
01:44:11,693 --> 01:44:12,922
between Jae Hyung and Ji Won.

2065
01:44:13,452 --> 01:44:16,063
When they developed feelings for each other.

2066
01:44:16,662 --> 01:44:20,063
At least I'd have fun watching the others ask questions.

2067
01:44:20,193 --> 01:44:23,001
Let's discuss and then start a round...

2068
01:44:23,002 --> 01:44:24,701
- All right. We'll discuss it first. - All right.

2069
01:44:24,702 --> 01:44:26,432
Then after each round,

2070
01:44:26,433 --> 01:44:28,371
we'll have time to briefly discuss,

2071
01:44:28,372 --> 01:44:29,502
and then we'll go another round.

2072
01:44:30,943 --> 01:44:36,113
(They each take time to discuss their first questions.)

2073
01:44:39,912 --> 01:44:43,222
I want you to ask the first question.

2074
01:44:43,223 --> 01:44:44,252
Okay.

2075
01:44:45,452 --> 01:44:47,652
What are you going to ask?

2076
01:44:47,653 --> 01:44:49,063
What do you want to ask the most?

2077
01:44:49,992 --> 01:44:51,992
Where his feelings were at during the trip to Gangwon Province.

2078
01:44:52,292 --> 01:44:53,762
No, I'm not curious about that.

2079
01:44:53,763 --> 01:44:54,831
- No? - No.

2080
01:44:54,832 --> 01:44:56,733
- That's not necessary information. - Then...

2081
01:45:04,143 --> 01:45:05,143
Right away?

2082
01:45:05,343 --> 01:45:07,172
What should you ask?

2083
01:45:08,143 --> 01:45:09,912
You want to ask Ji Won, right?

2084
01:45:10,013 --> 01:45:11,082
Yes.

2085
01:45:11,513 --> 01:45:12,582
What do you want to know?

2086
01:45:15,183 --> 01:45:16,251
You should decide.

2087
01:45:16,252 --> 01:45:18,792
Don't you have specific things you want to ask about?

2088
01:45:18,922 --> 01:45:20,353
Ask her this, then.

2089
01:45:22,563 --> 01:45:23,662
After the talk...

2090
01:45:25,693 --> 01:45:26,693
The talk today?

2091
01:45:28,063 --> 01:45:30,733
Also, another complication happened today.

2092
01:45:30,933 --> 01:45:32,872
I have another person to ask a question.

2093
01:45:34,303 --> 01:45:35,372
Do you know who it is?

2094
01:45:40,613 --> 01:45:42,013
(Nodding)

2095
01:45:46,683 --> 01:45:47,752
The one in the middle?

2096
01:45:47,922 --> 01:45:49,983
(He asks again to confirm that it's Yong Woo.)

2097
01:45:53,122 --> 01:45:54,522
Gosh. No.

2098
01:45:54,523 --> 01:45:56,462
No, please.

2099
01:45:56,822 --> 01:45:58,092
I really...

2100
01:45:58,093 --> 01:46:00,592
- want Yong Woo to go first. - Yes. That would be better.

2101
01:46:00,593 --> 01:46:02,201
- Right. - I just...

2102
01:46:02,202 --> 01:46:04,802
- don't want Se Seung to go first. - Right.

2103
01:46:04,803 --> 01:46:07,602
- Don't make others suffer. - I don't want that for Se Seung.

2104
01:46:07,603 --> 01:46:09,571
I don't want to see that.

2105
01:46:09,572 --> 01:46:11,103
No.

2106
01:46:11,742 --> 01:46:13,613
- I have a question. - What is it?

2107
01:46:13,943 --> 01:46:15,041
(She types it out on her phone and shows him.)

2108
01:46:15,042 --> 01:46:17,812
All right. We'll go with that.

2109
01:46:17,813 --> 01:46:20,113
I want you to ask all three of my questions for me. You?

2110
01:46:20,282 --> 01:46:21,381
You can ask all of mine for me too.

2111
01:46:21,382 --> 01:46:23,122
These are my questions.

2112
01:46:30,962 --> 01:46:33,032
What?

2113
01:46:33,292 --> 01:46:34,803
I got goosebumps.

2114
01:46:35,632 --> 01:46:37,802
He went on a secret date with Ji Won.

2115
01:46:37,803 --> 01:46:39,532
I wonder what they talked about.

2116
01:46:39,733 --> 01:46:41,072
- I had no idea. - You probably didn't know.

2117
01:46:41,973 --> 01:46:44,242
It's been going on for the past three days.

2118
01:46:44,343 --> 01:46:45,443
We'll talk about it later.

2119
01:46:49,712 --> 01:46:51,082
Another person...

2120
01:46:51,412 --> 01:46:53,352
Asking someone would be hard.

2121
01:46:53,353 --> 01:46:55,121
We're sitting so close to each other.

2122
01:46:55,122 --> 01:46:56,622
How are we supposed to discuss without the others listening?

2123
01:46:56,922 --> 01:46:58,751
You have to whisper, but you don't want to get that close.

2124
01:46:58,752 --> 01:47:00,122
- Right. - That's also true.

2125
01:47:00,792 --> 01:47:01,992
Is there anything you're curious about?

2126
01:47:02,223 --> 01:47:04,421
I've already...

2127
01:47:04,422 --> 01:47:06,332
Me too. I've already asked her everything.

2128
01:47:06,962 --> 01:47:09,202
I want to ask Yun Ha...

2129
01:47:13,973 --> 01:47:15,242
You want to know that for yourself, right?

2130
01:47:15,572 --> 01:47:16,903
I'm curious about that for myself.

2131
01:47:17,042 --> 01:47:19,171
What about you? What do you want me to ask?

2132
01:47:19,172 --> 01:47:21,012
There's nothing I want to ask.

2133
01:47:21,013 --> 01:47:23,212
(She's suggesting questions to Yun Jae.)

2134
01:47:24,782 --> 01:47:25,813
You want to ask that?

2135
01:47:26,752 --> 01:47:27,782
Gosh.

2136
01:47:28,523 --> 01:47:29,951
You're so tenacious.

2137
01:47:29,952 --> 01:47:32,292
- I'm curious. - Ask that to who?

2138
01:47:32,693 --> 01:47:34,292
- To Yun Ha. - Both?

2139
01:47:34,553 --> 01:47:36,022
- Yes. - Both?

2140
01:47:36,023 --> 01:47:37,392
That way it will be confusing.

2141
01:47:37,393 --> 01:47:39,733
You're smart.

2142
01:47:40,292 --> 01:47:41,603
I'm curious about you.

2143
01:47:41,763 --> 01:47:44,263
I've never cared... Been curious about you.

2144
01:47:44,433 --> 01:47:45,572
- Nice. - I'm curious about you today.

2145
01:47:46,502 --> 01:47:47,702
So...

2146
01:47:51,643 --> 01:47:52,712
To who?

2147
01:47:54,113 --> 01:47:55,143
What?

2148
01:47:55,712 --> 01:47:56,712
The one right next to you?

2149
01:47:59,353 --> 01:48:00,382
What should I ask?

2150
01:48:01,082 --> 01:48:02,183
I...

2151
01:48:03,723 --> 01:48:05,553
That's what I want to ask.

2152
01:48:05,653 --> 01:48:08,063
If he's here with sincere intentions...

2153
01:48:08,292 --> 01:48:09,763
instead of having other purposes.

2154
01:48:10,893 --> 01:48:14,631
And if he's still sticking to that.

2155
01:48:14,632 --> 01:48:16,232
But I don't think...

2156
01:48:16,233 --> 01:48:18,972
he would say he didn't come here with sincere intentions, though.

2157
01:48:18,973 --> 01:48:20,571
That's right. I agree.

2158
01:48:20,572 --> 01:48:21,572
Right.

2159
01:48:21,573 --> 01:48:23,502
I want to be blunt.

2160
01:48:24,403 --> 01:48:25,942
What kind of question should I come up with?

2161
01:48:25,943 --> 01:48:28,443
There's one day left, right?

2162
01:48:28,813 --> 01:48:31,042
There's one day left.

2163
01:48:31,212 --> 01:48:32,212
Okay.

2164
01:48:32,452 --> 01:48:33,512
- That's good. - Yes.

2165
01:48:33,513 --> 01:48:34,882
Now that I think about it, that's good.

2166
01:48:37,922 --> 01:48:41,661
(All of the siblings are done with their discussions.)

2167
01:48:41,662 --> 01:48:43,362
Then we'll go around.

2168
01:48:43,363 --> 01:48:45,962
We'll start...

2169
01:48:46,063 --> 01:48:47,461
- the first round. - Okay.

2170
01:48:47,462 --> 01:48:50,701
As Se Seung's sibling, I'll ask her a question.

2171
01:48:50,702 --> 01:48:52,273
- Okay. - Jung Sub.

2172
01:48:53,132 --> 01:48:54,742
Are you 1 of the 5 or the 4?

2173
01:48:55,143 --> 01:48:56,143
Gosh.

2174
01:48:56,542 --> 01:48:58,142
The five are...

2175
01:48:58,143 --> 01:48:59,342
- The five are... - Gosh.

2176
01:48:59,343 --> 01:49:01,711
- They asked two. - They're scary.

2177
01:49:01,712 --> 01:49:05,252
Five people wanted to be an actual couple after this.

2178
01:49:05,853 --> 01:49:08,782
Four people were still conflicted about their final decisions.

2179
01:49:09,053 --> 01:49:10,822
Are you 1 of those 5 or 4?

2180
01:49:11,792 --> 01:49:15,223
I think I'm the remaining one person.

2181
01:49:15,422 --> 01:49:16,622
What does that mean?

2182
01:49:17,023 --> 01:49:18,332
Would that be a second question?

2183
01:49:19,632 --> 01:49:23,461
Jae Hyung was shouting the question at Jung Sub.

2184
01:49:23,462 --> 01:49:25,131
I was so scared. I didn't know what was wrong with him.

2185
01:49:25,132 --> 01:49:27,402
Why would he behave like that with my brother?

2186
01:49:27,403 --> 01:49:30,303
That was my thought because his voice was just very loud.

2187
01:49:31,412 --> 01:49:32,572
I'm not a part of those four people.

2188
01:49:35,912 --> 01:49:38,482
He said he didn't belong to either the 5 or the 4.

2189
01:49:38,483 --> 01:49:41,082
But what he said confirmed my thoughts again.

2190
01:49:41,183 --> 01:49:44,353
"So that's what the final decision means to him."

2191
01:49:44,452 --> 01:49:46,353
The final decision is just a decision for him.

2192
01:49:46,492 --> 01:49:48,921
And that hurt me again.

2193
01:49:48,922 --> 01:49:50,461
I wanted to give her certainty...

2194
01:49:50,462 --> 01:49:51,831
that I was going to choose her.

2195
01:49:51,832 --> 01:49:53,893
I wanted to let her know.

2196
01:49:53,962 --> 01:49:56,331
Your voice is kind of scary.

2197
01:49:56,332 --> 01:49:57,462
I thought you might not be able to hear me.

2198
01:49:57,662 --> 01:49:59,903
- We can hear you very well. - All right.

2199
01:50:01,502 --> 01:50:03,741
- Gosh. - Gosh.

2200
01:50:03,742 --> 01:50:05,911
- Gosh. - That was like...

2201
01:50:05,912 --> 01:50:07,211
- "We can hear you well." - Did you see that?

2202
01:50:07,212 --> 01:50:09,842
That was a sibling moment.

2203
01:50:09,843 --> 01:50:12,553
I didn't expect to see a "don't mess with my brother" moment.

2204
01:50:13,183 --> 01:50:14,582
That's great.

2205
01:50:15,353 --> 01:50:17,781
Your voice is kind of scary.

2206
01:50:17,782 --> 01:50:19,022
I thought you might not be able to hear me.

2207
01:50:19,023 --> 01:50:20,552
- We can hear you very well. - All right.

2208
01:50:20,553 --> 01:50:21,693
Even I can't hear him.

2209
01:50:22,063 --> 01:50:24,763
- Well then, I'll ask a question. - Okay.

2210
01:50:24,962 --> 01:50:27,532
This is for the one with the loud voice.

2211
01:50:29,863 --> 01:50:33,072
When did your heart first flutter...

2212
01:50:33,332 --> 01:50:34,943
and what was the reason?

2213
01:50:36,273 --> 01:50:37,343
Can you tell us?

2214
01:50:44,712 --> 01:50:45,912
Do you need ten more seconds?

2215
01:50:48,153 --> 01:50:49,683
- I think he needs ten more minutes. - I was...

2216
01:50:49,752 --> 01:50:52,053
I went from being the host to answering a question.

2217
01:50:55,723 --> 01:50:57,062
We have to go three rounds, so...

2218
01:50:57,063 --> 01:50:59,632
- you shouldn't take too much time. - Right. Yes.

2219
01:50:59,863 --> 01:51:01,393
- It was... - Yes.

2220
01:51:01,702 --> 01:51:03,902
when Ji Won sang.

2221
01:51:03,903 --> 01:51:04,903
- I see. - I see.

2222
01:51:04,904 --> 01:51:07,202
Yes. Her voice and the way she behaved...

2223
01:51:07,903 --> 01:51:09,201
were the reason.

2224
01:51:09,202 --> 01:51:11,071
I have bad hearing.

2225
01:51:11,072 --> 01:51:13,071
- Was that Ju Yeon or Ji Won? - Ji Won.

2226
01:51:13,072 --> 01:51:14,143
Yes, all right.

2227
01:51:15,082 --> 01:51:16,242
He's too mischievous.

2228
01:51:16,513 --> 01:51:17,542
What?

2229
01:51:18,153 --> 01:51:20,312
As an older brother myself,

2230
01:51:20,313 --> 01:51:23,522
I don't think I can't even joke about something like that.

2231
01:51:23,523 --> 01:51:26,152
"I can't tell if you said Patricia or Potricia."

2232
01:51:26,153 --> 01:51:27,223
"Can you repeat that?"

2233
01:51:28,693 --> 01:51:30,792
I can't say that.

2234
01:51:31,292 --> 01:51:34,161
"Was that Patrasche or Patricia? Can you repeat that?"

2235
01:51:34,162 --> 01:51:36,802
- That's... - Stop.

2236
01:51:36,803 --> 01:51:38,802
Right. I can't say that.

2237
01:51:38,803 --> 01:51:40,631
- My gosh. - Yong Woo, you were wrong for that.

2238
01:51:40,632 --> 01:51:42,542
I feel bad after hearing that.

2239
01:51:42,702 --> 01:51:45,273
Gosh. I'm sorry. That wasn't my intention.

2240
01:51:45,973 --> 01:51:47,071
Gosh, that was...

2241
01:51:47,072 --> 01:51:48,711
I have bad hearing.

2242
01:51:48,712 --> 01:51:50,612
- Was that Ju Yeon or Ji Won? - Ji Won, yes.

2243
01:51:50,613 --> 01:51:51,683
Yes, all right.

2244
01:51:52,582 --> 01:51:53,653
He's too mischievous.

2245
01:51:58,792 --> 01:51:59,992
That was unexpected.

2246
01:52:00,153 --> 01:52:01,392
I kind of felt light in the head.

2247
01:52:01,393 --> 01:52:04,961
I put my all into dancing that day and didn't get a message from him,

2248
01:52:04,962 --> 01:52:06,531
so I was upset.

2249
01:52:06,532 --> 01:52:08,832
I was so upset that I had a hard time...

2250
01:52:09,603 --> 01:52:11,773
working at my job the next day.

2251
01:52:12,002 --> 01:52:14,671
He developed a crush on someone else that day,

2252
01:52:14,672 --> 01:52:16,872
and that was why he didn't send me a message.

2253
01:52:17,172 --> 01:52:18,712
All the pieces came together,

2254
01:52:20,372 --> 01:52:22,542
and I was just like, "I see."

2255
01:52:23,513 --> 01:52:24,582
Next question.

2256
01:52:24,712 --> 01:52:27,782
I will ask his question.

2257
01:52:29,452 --> 01:52:32,792
My question is for Ji Won.

2258
01:52:35,922 --> 01:52:38,933
Will today's secret date cause...

2259
01:52:40,832 --> 01:52:43,803
a difference between your recent messages in Singapore...

2260
01:52:45,002 --> 01:52:47,072
and the decision you'll make tomorrow?

2261
01:52:52,013 --> 01:52:53,541
I've been expecting it,

2262
01:52:53,542 --> 01:52:55,613
but that confirmed he had feelings for Ji Won.

2263
01:52:55,843 --> 01:52:57,613
That's when I realized what was going on.

2264
01:52:57,843 --> 01:52:59,751
When he said "morning,"

2265
01:52:59,752 --> 01:53:02,553
that meant he had a secret date with Ji Won before he met me.

2266
01:53:03,053 --> 01:53:06,452
I was embarrassed but also frustrated.

2267
01:53:07,252 --> 01:53:09,063
Why did he mislead me?

2268
01:53:09,622 --> 01:53:10,762
That's right.

2269
01:53:10,763 --> 01:53:12,461
- She has a right to be frustrated. - I know.

2270
01:53:12,462 --> 01:53:13,791
- That's what I'm saying. - She must feel frustrated.

2271
01:53:13,792 --> 01:53:15,862
- Thankfully, now she knows. - Now she knows.

2272
01:53:15,863 --> 01:53:17,201
Jae Hyung doesn't even know...

2273
01:53:17,202 --> 01:53:18,973
- they went on a date. - Right.

2274
01:53:19,172 --> 01:53:20,831
He doesn't know about her date with Yong Woo.

2275
01:53:20,832 --> 01:53:23,303
I think this is a hard question to answer.

2276
01:53:25,443 --> 01:53:27,343
(Ji Won still hasn't answered.)

2277
01:53:28,782 --> 01:53:30,182
- Gosh, that's scary. - Gosh.

2278
01:53:30,183 --> 01:53:33,613
Aren't you basically asking me to make my final decision right now?

2279
01:53:47,532 --> 01:53:50,332
I have to be really honest, though.

2280
01:53:56,773 --> 01:53:57,843
This is so scary.

2281
01:53:58,672 --> 01:54:00,313
I'm still...

2282
01:54:01,613 --> 01:54:03,012
thinking about it.

2283
01:54:03,013 --> 01:54:04,211
You're still thinking about it?

2284
01:54:04,212 --> 01:54:07,412
I haven't made up my mind yet.

2285
01:54:15,122 --> 01:54:16,122
All right.

2286
01:54:17,523 --> 01:54:19,032
Well, as I expected,

2287
01:54:19,233 --> 01:54:22,063
it wasn't time for Ji Won to be certain about her decision.

2288
01:54:22,162 --> 01:54:24,732
I wasn't really curious about her answer.

2289
01:54:24,733 --> 01:54:27,733
I wanted to make Ji Won feel alert...

2290
01:54:28,072 --> 01:54:29,872
with that question.

2291
01:54:33,943 --> 01:54:35,541
I completely misunderstood.

2292
01:54:35,542 --> 01:54:36,843
Right. What?

2293
01:54:38,313 --> 01:54:39,853
- You talked with him? - Yes.

2294
01:54:39,882 --> 01:54:41,613
I thought I was his only date.

2295
01:54:41,752 --> 01:54:43,082
I didn't know about Ji Won.

2296
01:54:45,122 --> 01:54:46,153
- All right. - Then...

2297
01:54:49,322 --> 01:54:51,363
- That's just... - Goodness.

2298
01:54:52,093 --> 01:54:54,063
Jae Hyung didn't understand just now.

2299
01:54:55,832 --> 01:54:58,803
It's your turn to ask a question, Yun Jae.

2300
01:55:00,202 --> 01:55:02,041
- All right. - This question is for you.

2301
01:55:02,042 --> 01:55:03,071
Okay.

2302
01:55:03,072 --> 01:55:05,001
What were your thoughts...

2303
01:55:05,002 --> 01:55:08,212
when you sent the message after your date with Yong Woo?

2304
01:55:09,613 --> 01:55:11,683
Ji Won wants to know.

2305
01:55:12,053 --> 01:55:15,353
Ji Won can find out two things through this question.

2306
01:55:16,183 --> 01:55:18,352
What were your thoughts...

2307
01:55:18,353 --> 01:55:21,492
when you sent the message after your date with Yong Woo?

2308
01:55:26,363 --> 01:55:29,602
I wanted to repay him for the time...

2309
01:55:29,603 --> 01:55:31,532
we spent together that day.

2310
01:55:31,603 --> 01:55:34,532
We had a fun time that day,

2311
01:55:34,903 --> 01:55:37,143
so I sent a message to Yong Woo.

2312
01:55:39,172 --> 01:55:40,412
- All right. - All right.

2313
01:55:40,813 --> 01:55:42,643
I didn't know we could ask questions like that.

2314
01:55:42,983 --> 01:55:46,513
My question is for Yun Ha.

2315
01:55:47,353 --> 01:55:48,952
Are you 1 of the 5 or the 4?

2316
01:55:49,752 --> 01:55:51,381
- Gosh. - Gosh.

2317
01:55:51,382 --> 01:55:53,821
I was expecting this. Hold on.

2318
01:55:53,822 --> 01:55:56,062
I answered that...

2319
01:55:56,063 --> 01:55:59,192
I wanted to take some time to get to know each other...

2320
01:55:59,193 --> 01:56:02,063
once this was over. That's what I did.

2321
01:56:02,502 --> 01:56:03,502
All right.

2322
01:56:03,503 --> 01:56:05,202
A brush of a fist could be the fatal blow here.

2323
01:56:05,702 --> 01:56:07,273
A brush of a fist could have you spilling blood.

2324
01:56:08,643 --> 01:56:09,902
It's Jung Sub's turn.

2325
01:56:09,903 --> 01:56:11,473
Yes. Yun Jae.

2326
01:56:14,013 --> 01:56:16,843
Do you want to become a couple right away when this is over,

2327
01:56:17,143 --> 01:56:20,483
or do you want to take time to get to know each other?

2328
01:56:20,752 --> 01:56:21,752
I want to become a couple right away.

2329
01:56:21,752 --> 01:56:22,752
(I want to become a couple right away.)

2330
01:56:26,053 --> 01:56:27,122
- Gosh. - Gosh.

2331
01:56:27,853 --> 01:56:29,962
- Gosh. - That's great.

2332
01:56:30,792 --> 01:56:31,792
Next question.

2333
01:56:31,793 --> 01:56:33,792
- He's the manliest man here. - Right.

2334
01:56:35,032 --> 01:56:36,303
It was amazing.

2335
01:56:36,433 --> 01:56:37,832
My heart was beating so fast.

2336
01:56:38,403 --> 01:56:39,701
Her heart was beating so fast.

2337
01:56:39,702 --> 01:56:40,973
He's amazing.

2338
01:56:41,103 --> 01:56:43,343
- I feel at ease. - I know.

2339
01:56:44,303 --> 01:56:45,711
This reminds me of that one commercial.

2340
01:56:45,712 --> 01:56:46,772
Wait.

2341
01:56:46,773 --> 01:56:49,343
Are you trying to make a new meme for that?

2342
01:56:49,712 --> 01:56:50,712
It's time for a new one.

2343
01:56:50,713 --> 01:56:52,512
- That's true. - It's time for it to be renewed.

2344
01:56:52,513 --> 01:56:54,183
- The original meme is too old. - It's time for a replacement.

2345
01:56:54,382 --> 01:56:55,522
She's so happy.

2346
01:56:55,523 --> 01:56:57,053
They're like a completely different genre.

2347
01:56:59,153 --> 01:57:02,193
Saying that in public was so cool of him.

2348
01:57:02,393 --> 01:57:04,763
I'm so thankful.

2349
01:57:04,962 --> 01:57:06,362
He's so reliable.

2350
01:57:06,363 --> 01:57:09,363
The way he cherishes me and likes me...

2351
01:57:09,563 --> 01:57:11,201
makes me really happy.

2352
01:57:11,202 --> 01:57:12,773
Yun Jae's in love.

2353
01:57:13,273 --> 01:57:15,172
Yun Jae is in love.

2354
01:57:15,273 --> 01:57:17,402
He basically confessed his feelings.

2355
01:57:17,403 --> 01:57:19,172
I think he deserves a round of applause.

2356
01:57:19,813 --> 01:57:21,442
Kudos to you.

2357
01:57:21,443 --> 01:57:22,912
- Gosh. - Goodness.

2358
01:57:23,912 --> 01:57:26,782
My question is for Se Seung.

2359
01:57:28,553 --> 01:57:30,881
I want to know if you're open to getting to know each other...

2360
01:57:30,882 --> 01:57:35,053
once this is over, instead of becoming a couple right away.

2361
01:57:35,593 --> 01:57:38,662
Of course.

2362
01:57:40,132 --> 01:57:41,631
- You are open to it? - Yes.

2363
01:57:41,632 --> 01:57:44,063
Yes, all right.

2364
01:57:44,462 --> 01:57:46,802
Why would he want to know something so obvious?

2365
01:57:46,803 --> 01:57:49,902
I asked him if he had any thoughts about after the final decision.

2366
01:57:49,903 --> 01:57:52,241
Did he think I wanted to start a relationship with him right away?

2367
01:57:52,242 --> 01:57:55,881
"At least she wants to get to know me better."

2368
01:57:55,882 --> 01:57:57,881
That was what I thought.

2369
01:57:57,882 --> 01:57:59,911
I was a bit taken aback, though.

2370
01:57:59,912 --> 01:58:00,951
I felt like...

2371
01:58:00,952 --> 01:58:05,152
the answer was different from how it felt during the secret date.

2372
01:58:05,153 --> 01:58:07,692
So I was slightly confused.

2373
01:58:07,693 --> 01:58:08,693
This is so intense.

2374
01:58:08,962 --> 01:58:10,991
I have no energy.

2375
01:58:10,992 --> 01:58:12,132
Why are my hands shaking?

2376
01:58:12,863 --> 01:58:13,933
Did you get what he had?

2377
01:58:14,962 --> 01:58:17,803
Yong Woo.

2378
01:58:17,962 --> 01:58:20,332
I want to ask a question to Yong Woo.

2379
01:58:23,343 --> 01:58:26,672
We have one day left before the final decision.

2380
01:58:30,082 --> 01:58:32,653
Is there room for a change of heart?

2381
01:58:33,053 --> 01:58:36,023
Please answer with a yes or no,

2382
01:58:36,153 --> 01:58:38,153
and I want you to look me in my eyes when you answer.

2383
01:58:39,492 --> 01:58:41,292
Your eyes are too pretty for me to look at them.

2384
01:58:41,693 --> 01:58:43,222
- You still have to look at them. - Right.

2385
01:58:43,223 --> 01:58:45,462
Let's ask them to look at our noses.

2386
01:58:46,233 --> 01:58:47,233
No.

2387
01:58:48,332 --> 01:58:51,201
I wanted to see his eyes twitch.

2388
01:58:51,202 --> 01:58:53,832
Is there room for a change of heart before my final decision?

2389
01:58:54,202 --> 01:58:55,372
- Yes or No? - Right.

2390
01:58:56,742 --> 01:58:58,443
- Yes. - Yes?

2391
01:59:00,273 --> 01:59:03,882
I'm not sure about Yong Woo.

2392
01:59:04,082 --> 01:59:06,382
I don't know how to feel about him anymore.

2393
01:59:06,952 --> 01:59:09,881
What does that mean? What does he mean by that?

2394
01:59:09,882 --> 01:59:13,652
Does he mean it might change from his previous choice?

2395
01:59:13,653 --> 01:59:16,491
Or does he mean it might change during the time we have left...

2396
01:59:16,492 --> 01:59:18,522
from this moment onward?

2397
01:59:18,523 --> 01:59:21,032
I couldn't understand what he meant.

2398
01:59:21,132 --> 01:59:22,831
Wasn't Cheol Hyeon asking if...

2399
01:59:22,832 --> 01:59:25,603
his feelings could return to Cho A, although he likes Ji Won right now?

2400
01:59:25,672 --> 01:59:27,473
If there's a chance his feelings for Cho A might return?

2401
01:59:27,532 --> 01:59:30,241
I think Yong Woo understood the question differently.

2402
01:59:30,242 --> 01:59:31,701
- It was the opposite for him. - Right. Cho A.

2403
01:59:31,702 --> 01:59:34,411
- If it could be someone else. - He understood it as whether...

2404
01:59:34,412 --> 01:59:35,483
it could go from Cho A to someone else.

2405
01:59:35,912 --> 01:59:37,742
- And that's why he said yes. - Right.

2406
01:59:41,212 --> 01:59:44,653
- I have a question for Ji Won. - Sure.

2407
01:59:45,082 --> 01:59:47,622
After today's secret date,

2408
01:59:50,193 --> 01:59:53,232
do you feel more at ease...

2409
01:59:53,233 --> 01:59:54,532
or uncomfortable?

2410
01:59:54,792 --> 01:59:55,863
I see.

2411
01:59:59,233 --> 02:00:00,473
I feel...

2412
02:00:02,742 --> 02:00:04,442
not at ease.

2413
02:00:04,443 --> 02:00:06,172
Yes. I feel uncomfortable.

2414
02:00:06,872 --> 02:00:08,241
What did she say?

2415
02:00:08,242 --> 02:00:09,943
She feels more uncomfortable.

2416
02:00:14,013 --> 02:00:18,752
I eventually ended up becoming certain about her,

2417
02:00:18,893 --> 02:00:20,652
and I thought her face seemed brighter...

2418
02:00:20,653 --> 02:00:23,762
during the last conversation we had.

2419
02:00:23,763 --> 02:00:25,661
Her face seemed more content.

2420
02:00:25,662 --> 02:00:27,092
Yes, that's what I thought.

2421
02:00:27,093 --> 02:00:29,331
That’s why I had thought...

2422
02:00:29,332 --> 02:00:31,602
the conversation we had...

2423
02:00:31,603 --> 02:00:34,903
must have helped her with her final decision.

2424
02:00:35,072 --> 02:00:38,501
Why? What is she thinking so much about?

2425
02:00:38,502 --> 02:00:41,613
I felt frustrated and uncomfortable.

2426
02:00:43,382 --> 02:00:45,852
Shall we take some time to discuss again?

2427
02:00:45,853 --> 02:00:46,951
Yes, let's have discussions.

2428
02:00:46,952 --> 02:00:48,013
(They decide to discuss again for the next round of questions.)

2429
02:00:48,353 --> 02:00:50,023
But depending on the answer,

2430
02:00:50,122 --> 02:00:51,382
my question could change too.

2431
02:00:54,153 --> 02:00:55,693
- It's done. - You pressed it too much.

2432
02:00:56,122 --> 02:00:57,292
What is it?

2433
02:00:58,162 --> 02:00:59,492
I don't understand.

2434
02:00:59,763 --> 02:01:02,132
Why? What did you talk about?

2435
02:01:02,603 --> 02:01:04,332
During the secret date,

2436
02:01:04,733 --> 02:01:07,201
Yong Woo said that he was leaning toward Cho A.

2437
02:01:07,202 --> 02:01:08,973
Now, he is neutral.

2438
02:01:09,273 --> 02:01:12,513
He is leaning toward someone else now.

2439
02:01:13,273 --> 02:01:14,943
Someone new.

2440
02:01:15,273 --> 02:01:17,881
And apparently, he thought about...

2441
02:01:17,882 --> 02:01:21,211
sending a message to this person once.

2442
02:01:21,212 --> 02:01:22,752
He always sent a message to the same person.

2443
02:01:24,282 --> 02:01:25,492
He said that.

2444
02:01:29,023 --> 02:01:30,392
So I thought...

2445
02:01:30,393 --> 02:01:32,363
Hold on. To whom did Ju Yeon ask a question?

2446
02:01:33,532 --> 02:01:36,933
Ji Won. Ju Yeon asked Ji Won a question.

2447
02:01:37,303 --> 02:01:38,562
That's right.

2448
02:01:38,563 --> 02:01:40,433
- Isn't it a drama? Seriously. - I got goosebumps.

2449
02:01:40,532 --> 02:01:42,443
Secrets are unveiled.

2450
02:01:42,542 --> 02:01:43,842
He feels confused.

2451
02:01:43,843 --> 02:01:45,402
Maybe he is going, "No way."

2452
02:01:45,403 --> 02:01:46,773
Oh, no.

2453
02:01:47,672 --> 02:01:48,943
He said that.

2454
02:01:52,553 --> 02:01:53,781
So I thought...

2455
02:01:53,782 --> 02:01:55,752
Hold on. To whom did Ju Yeon ask a question?

2456
02:01:56,983 --> 02:02:00,353
Ji Won. Ju Yeon asked Ji Won a question.

2457
02:02:00,822 --> 02:02:04,162
So Ju Yeon asked Ji Won a question.

2458
02:02:04,523 --> 02:02:07,291
Ju Yeon asked Ji Won a question...

2459
02:02:07,292 --> 02:02:08,803
- on Yong Woo's behalf. - Yes.

2460
02:02:08,903 --> 02:02:11,063
I thought he was leaning toward me.

2461
02:02:13,532 --> 02:02:14,803
I was worried for no reason.

2462
02:02:25,782 --> 02:02:28,013
It was the first question.

2463
02:02:30,223 --> 02:02:32,822
But he wasn't torn between two people.

2464
02:02:32,952 --> 02:02:35,393
He said there was a new direction.

2465
02:02:39,792 --> 02:02:42,863
- What? - I went, "Me, so suddenly? Why?"

2466
02:02:42,962 --> 02:02:44,632
I was completely confused.

2467
02:02:44,733 --> 02:02:46,433
There was no reason to do that.

2468
02:02:46,933 --> 02:02:49,541
I thought Yong Woo was expressing his interest in me very suddenly,

2469
02:02:49,542 --> 02:02:50,942
so I felt really uncomfortable.

2470
02:02:50,943 --> 02:02:52,512
I got completely confused...

2471
02:02:52,513 --> 02:02:53,843
and went ahead of myself.

2472
02:02:53,943 --> 02:02:56,013
Then why did he have a secret date with me?

2473
02:02:57,212 --> 02:02:58,881
- Why did he ask to see you? - Yong Woo had...

2474
02:02:58,882 --> 02:03:00,812
a date with two people, Ji Won and me.

2475
02:03:00,813 --> 02:03:02,751
But he didn't send a message to either one of us.

2476
02:03:02,752 --> 02:03:03,822
I guess he felt bad.

2477
02:03:04,252 --> 02:03:05,382
That was why he saw the two of us.

2478
02:03:05,653 --> 02:03:09,121
Se Seung had a secret date with Yong Woo.

2479
02:03:09,122 --> 02:03:10,392
"Since he could choose two people,"

2480
02:03:10,393 --> 02:03:13,433
"Yong Woo must have had a secret date with Ji Won too."

2481
02:03:13,532 --> 02:03:16,263
So Yong Woo had a secret date with Se Seung and Ji Won.

2482
02:03:16,632 --> 02:03:18,502
I don't understand.

2483
02:03:19,433 --> 02:03:21,672
Why did I waste my emotions?

2484
02:03:26,172 --> 02:03:27,172
My goodness.

2485
02:03:27,443 --> 02:03:29,613
Ji Won had a date with three people today.

2486
02:03:31,683 --> 02:03:35,012
I don't think she will get confused about Cheol Hyeon...

2487
02:03:35,013 --> 02:03:36,621
or Yong Woo.

2488
02:03:36,622 --> 02:03:38,321
My judgment is based on the conversations we had so far.

2489
02:03:38,322 --> 02:03:40,321
But I guess it depends on...

2490
02:03:40,322 --> 02:03:43,122
how deep of a conversation she had with Yong Woo today.

2491
02:03:43,393 --> 02:03:45,562
What should I ask then? What should I ask?

2492
02:03:45,563 --> 02:03:46,962
Ask Ji Won a question.

2493
02:03:54,733 --> 02:03:56,242
What do you want to ask?

2494
02:03:58,943 --> 02:04:01,872
The thing is, I already made up my mind.

2495
02:04:01,973 --> 02:04:04,143
So I don't want to ask a question.

2496
02:04:04,582 --> 02:04:08,113
He didn't think beyond the final decision.

2497
02:04:10,322 --> 02:04:12,593
He talked as if I was being too much.

2498
02:04:13,093 --> 02:04:14,652
It made me think,

2499
02:04:14,653 --> 02:04:16,263
"What did I do so far?"

2500
02:04:17,093 --> 02:04:18,662
I am not curious about anything.

2501
02:04:19,632 --> 02:04:20,662
You can ask him anything.

2502
02:04:21,263 --> 02:04:22,363
I don't know.

2503
02:04:23,632 --> 02:04:25,032
I don't know how Se Seung feels.

2504
02:04:25,532 --> 02:04:26,532
- Really? - Yes.

2505
02:04:26,533 --> 02:04:29,442
- Let me ask her how she feels now. - Yes.

2506
02:04:29,443 --> 02:04:31,402
"How do you feel after the secret date?"

2507
02:04:31,403 --> 02:04:32,513
"How do you feel now?"

2508
02:04:33,013 --> 02:04:35,881
I don't have any questions to ask.

2509
02:04:35,882 --> 02:04:38,212
I don't have any questions for Yun Jae since he is so clear.

2510
02:04:38,912 --> 02:04:40,053
Shall I ask Yong Woo a question?

2511
02:04:40,153 --> 02:04:41,153
Yong Woo.

2512
02:04:41,154 --> 02:04:44,552
"For a long time, you sent a message to only one person."

2513
02:04:44,553 --> 02:04:46,092
"You seem to be very careful."

2514
02:04:46,093 --> 02:04:48,153
"Why did you send a message to my sister?"

2515
02:04:52,733 --> 02:04:54,962
Then ask Yun Jae the last question.

2516
02:04:55,063 --> 02:04:58,161
Ask him if he would be willing to accept it...

2517
02:04:58,162 --> 02:04:59,572
if I explore further.

2518
02:05:00,303 --> 02:05:01,303
- That's a good one. - Yes.

2519
02:05:01,304 --> 02:05:02,443
Shall I ask that question first?

2520
02:05:03,372 --> 02:05:05,472
No. Shall I ask that question first?

2521
02:05:05,473 --> 02:05:06,572
- Ask that question first. - Okay.

2522
02:05:07,443 --> 02:05:10,982
Ask Ji Won when she first relayed her feelings...

2523
02:05:10,983 --> 02:05:13,683
to Jae Hyung.

2524
02:05:14,212 --> 02:05:16,222
Let me ask you this.

2525
02:05:16,223 --> 02:05:17,782
What is important about that?

2526
02:05:18,853 --> 02:05:19,921
Why is it important?

2527
02:05:19,922 --> 02:05:21,251
What is important about that question?

2528
02:05:21,252 --> 02:05:23,992
I want to know when they began to like each other.

2529
02:05:25,962 --> 02:05:27,192
- Then... - It's a bad question.

2530
02:05:27,193 --> 02:05:28,262
- Is it a bad question? - Yes.

2531
02:05:28,263 --> 02:05:29,461
- It's too... - Talk to me then.

2532
02:05:29,462 --> 02:05:32,202
What do you want to ascertain now?

2533
02:05:32,502 --> 02:05:33,732
Do you want to give up?

2534
02:05:33,733 --> 02:05:35,671
If I could change his mind, I would.

2535
02:05:35,672 --> 02:05:37,201
Right. If you want to do that,

2536
02:05:37,202 --> 02:05:38,903
ask what you really want to know.

2537
02:05:39,712 --> 02:05:41,172
Let's do this. If...

2538
02:05:48,183 --> 02:05:49,422
I think my question...

2539
02:05:49,882 --> 02:05:51,653
might put Jae Hyung in a bad mood.

2540
02:05:51,952 --> 02:05:53,553
- A very bad mood. - That's right.

2541
02:05:56,763 --> 02:05:58,263
How about you? What do you want to ask?

2542
02:06:08,572 --> 02:06:11,002
Ask her if she believes in fate. That's all you need to ask.

2543
02:06:11,443 --> 02:06:13,042
It's about the conversation the two of us had.

2544
02:06:14,742 --> 02:06:16,882
"Do you think..."

2545
02:06:17,643 --> 02:06:20,483
"fate could change your decision tomorrow?"

2546
02:06:20,912 --> 02:06:23,252
What do you think? Fate will be the excuse.

2547
02:06:23,822 --> 02:06:27,422
My brother is a bit... Sometimes, I don't understand him.

2548
02:06:28,093 --> 02:06:30,092
He can be too sentimental at times.

2549
02:06:30,093 --> 02:06:31,922
He becomes absorbed in himself.

2550
02:06:32,322 --> 02:06:34,863
When he is like that, I cringe a lot.

2551
02:06:34,962 --> 02:06:36,802
But it's something between the two of them.

2552
02:06:36,803 --> 02:06:39,032
It's something only Yong Woo and Ji Won would understand.

2553
02:06:39,132 --> 02:06:40,832
They must have had quite the date.

2554
02:06:42,702 --> 02:06:45,103
"Yong Woo, do you have feelings for Ji Won?"

2555
02:06:46,912 --> 02:06:48,371
- It was revealed. - When was it revealed?

2556
02:06:48,372 --> 02:06:49,943
Ju Yeon asked Ji Won a question.

2557
02:06:51,683 --> 02:06:53,313
Go ahead and do that.

2558
02:06:58,322 --> 02:07:01,353
- Then you thought... - I know for certain.

2559
02:07:01,553 --> 02:07:02,563
No.

2560
02:07:03,922 --> 02:07:06,332
If I combine what you said so far,

2561
02:07:06,933 --> 02:07:08,562
you went from the group of 5 to the group of 4.

2562
02:07:08,563 --> 02:07:10,332
If there has been a change at heart...

2563
02:07:10,532 --> 02:07:12,672
"Are you really here to find a serious partner?"

2564
02:07:13,832 --> 02:07:14,933
Okay.

2565
02:07:15,303 --> 02:07:17,572
I think he will just say, "Yes."

2566
02:07:17,773 --> 02:07:19,512
The emotions you feel are important.

2567
02:07:19,513 --> 02:07:21,671
- I see. - The look in his eyes and such...

2568
02:07:21,672 --> 02:07:23,242
will tell you if he is telling the truth.

2569
02:07:23,443 --> 02:07:25,683
- When he talks? - You will get a hunch that way.

2570
02:07:26,153 --> 02:07:27,153
There is no need.

2571
02:07:29,452 --> 02:07:30,922
You can do that.

2572
02:07:31,483 --> 02:07:33,422
Is there anyone else you are curious about?

2573
02:07:34,223 --> 02:07:37,662
Earlier, Yong Woo said that he might change.

2574
02:07:41,462 --> 02:07:45,903
Ask him if he still hasn't made the decision.

2575
02:07:47,872 --> 02:07:48,872
You should ask him that.

2576
02:07:49,542 --> 02:07:51,072
I will ask these two questions.

2577
02:07:52,403 --> 02:07:54,572
How did this suddenly happen?

2578
02:07:54,843 --> 02:07:56,042
I don't know.

2579
02:07:56,443 --> 02:07:58,541
I will tell you when I can.

2580
02:07:58,542 --> 02:08:00,912
Seriously. Let's have the Siblings' Room today.

2581
02:08:01,113 --> 02:08:02,881
Let's talk. What did you hear from him?

2582
02:08:02,882 --> 02:08:04,952
- This is hard. - I am so curious.

2583
02:08:05,622 --> 02:08:06,752
Why are you making me go crazy?

2584
02:08:07,853 --> 02:08:09,922
- In any case, it's fun. - Do you think it's fun?

2585
02:08:10,763 --> 02:08:13,263
- It's okay. - I am about to faint.

2586
02:08:18,702 --> 02:08:21,803
(The second questions begin.)

2587
02:08:22,433 --> 02:08:23,871
- Jung Sub. - Yes?

2588
02:08:23,872 --> 02:08:25,702
You had a secret date today.

2589
02:08:26,672 --> 02:08:30,382
Then just now, you said that you weren't 1 of those 4 people.

2590
02:08:30,912 --> 02:08:33,452
Do you still feel the same?

2591
02:08:33,813 --> 02:08:35,983
Has there been a change of heart?

2592
02:08:39,053 --> 02:08:40,922
There... Well...

2593
02:08:43,223 --> 02:08:44,792
There hasn't been a change of heart.

2594
02:08:49,132 --> 02:08:51,132
I want to have a deep conversation.

2595
02:08:52,532 --> 02:08:55,202
Would that answer suffice?

2596
02:08:56,672 --> 02:08:58,202
It's up to you.

2597
02:09:00,143 --> 02:09:03,041
It seemed like the question was based on doubt,

2598
02:09:03,042 --> 02:09:04,483
so I wanted to give her certainty.

2599
02:09:04,582 --> 02:09:06,612
Asking me if there has been a change of heart...

2600
02:09:06,613 --> 02:09:08,751
is the same as asking me...

2601
02:09:08,752 --> 02:09:10,882
if I will choose someone else.

2602
02:09:11,082 --> 02:09:13,153
So I said that there hasn't been a change of heart.

2603
02:09:13,252 --> 02:09:16,292
By asking him if there has been a change of heart,

2604
02:09:16,593 --> 02:09:18,822
I was asking him if his thoughts changed...

2605
02:09:19,122 --> 02:09:20,961
regarding what would come after the final decision.

2606
02:09:20,962 --> 02:09:22,492
That was the meaning behind the question.

2607
02:09:22,803 --> 02:09:25,131
He said that there hasn't been a change of heart.

2608
02:09:25,132 --> 02:09:26,303
It made me go, "He is certain."

2609
02:09:26,702 --> 02:09:30,001
His answer hurt me once more.

2610
02:09:30,002 --> 02:09:31,843
It just kept going the same way.

2611
02:09:32,343 --> 02:09:34,912
- Jae Hyung. - Yes?

2612
02:09:37,782 --> 02:09:38,843
Let's say...

2613
02:09:41,952 --> 02:09:46,053
the person you have been spending a lot of time with recently...

2614
02:09:46,893 --> 02:09:48,693
chooses someone else.

2615
02:09:50,763 --> 02:09:53,662
Would you choose someone else then?

2616
02:09:59,773 --> 02:10:01,832
Why did that man butt in?

2617
02:10:02,843 --> 02:10:03,843
No.

2618
02:10:04,273 --> 02:10:05,843
- Is that your answer? - Yes.

2619
02:10:08,212 --> 02:10:09,943
That won't affect my decision.

2620
02:10:13,513 --> 02:10:16,822
I know that Jae Hyung isn't the type to do such a thing.

2621
02:10:16,922 --> 02:10:19,153
But it was for Ji Won to hear.

2622
02:10:19,252 --> 02:10:21,192
"I am interested in you."

2623
02:10:21,193 --> 02:10:23,562
"I want you to change your mind tomorrow."

2624
02:10:23,563 --> 02:10:26,063
It was my way of expressing myself.

2625
02:10:30,202 --> 02:10:32,462
Why did he ask me that question?

2626
02:10:32,702 --> 02:10:34,303
There must be something I don't know about.

2627
02:10:34,603 --> 02:10:36,973
As everyone knows, Ji Won is the one...

2628
02:10:37,072 --> 02:10:39,273
I have been spending a lot of time with recently.

2629
02:10:39,372 --> 02:10:40,872
He asked about...

2630
02:10:41,273 --> 02:10:43,512
her choosing someone else.

2631
02:10:43,513 --> 02:10:46,082
I thought he was talking about the third party.

2632
02:10:46,153 --> 02:10:48,852
It seemed like Yong Woo knew something...

2633
02:10:48,853 --> 02:10:50,821
I didn't know about.

2634
02:10:50,822 --> 02:10:52,992
It seemed like he was feeling me out.

2635
02:10:53,093 --> 02:10:56,121
"What on earth is going on?"

2636
02:10:56,122 --> 02:10:57,322
I had that thought a lot.

2637
02:10:57,593 --> 02:10:59,491
But despite everything,

2638
02:10:59,492 --> 02:11:02,962
I will give her certainty without getting wavered.

2639
02:11:03,063 --> 02:11:05,332
That way, I will have a chance...

2640
02:11:05,702 --> 02:11:07,773
even if she gets wavered.

2641
02:11:07,872 --> 02:11:10,302
Ju Yeon was very upset.

2642
02:11:10,303 --> 02:11:12,501
She made a facial expression I had never seen before.

2643
02:11:12,502 --> 02:11:14,742
He answered better than I expected.

2644
02:11:14,843 --> 02:11:16,081
He wasn't very flustered.

2645
02:11:16,082 --> 02:11:18,242
It seemed like Jae Hyung was becoming certain...

2646
02:11:18,343 --> 02:11:20,582
through these questions...

2647
02:11:21,313 --> 02:11:22,412
and I hated that.

2648
02:11:23,023 --> 02:11:25,252
It put me in a bad mood.

2649
02:11:27,292 --> 02:11:28,853
I will ask a question.

2650
02:11:29,223 --> 02:11:31,422
It's for Ji Won.

2651
02:11:36,202 --> 02:11:38,063
Do you think fate can change your decision tomorrow?

2652
02:11:40,672 --> 02:11:44,702
Do you think fate can change your decision tomorrow?

2653
02:11:50,042 --> 02:11:51,882
- Fate? - I didn't get that.

2654
02:11:52,082 --> 02:11:54,712
Ju Yeon is asking a question on Yong Woo's behalf.

2655
02:11:54,813 --> 02:11:56,223
Yong Woo isn't asking a question for himself.

2656
02:12:05,263 --> 02:12:09,093
I have always believed in fate.

2657
02:12:10,002 --> 02:12:12,332
I think fate can change it.

2658
02:12:18,443 --> 02:12:21,072
That question...

2659
02:12:21,172 --> 02:12:25,042
seemed to ask me about my feelings...

2660
02:12:25,143 --> 02:12:27,683
using the words only I understood.

2661
02:12:27,782 --> 02:12:30,452
In a sense, people got used to seeing Ji Won...

2662
02:12:30,553 --> 02:12:33,223
go on a date with Jae Hyung.

2663
02:12:33,322 --> 02:12:34,792
Through this opportunity,

2664
02:12:34,893 --> 02:12:37,862
I wanted people to think, "So this is the current situation."

2665
02:12:37,863 --> 02:12:40,492
"Ji Won's decision might change."

2666
02:12:40,863 --> 02:12:42,432
I wanted to create that atmosphere.

2667
02:12:42,433 --> 02:12:44,862
That question made me think, "There must be something."

2668
02:12:44,863 --> 02:12:45,962
I became certain.

2669
02:12:46,303 --> 02:12:49,233
She might be torn between me and someone else.

2670
02:12:50,702 --> 02:12:54,313
But I found it a bit odd that the question was about fate.

2671
02:12:54,513 --> 02:12:56,411
When Ji Won and I went on our first date,

2672
02:12:56,412 --> 02:12:58,183
we said, "We really are fatalists."

2673
02:12:58,813 --> 02:13:02,513
(Ji Won talked about fate with Jae Hyung as well.)

2674
02:13:02,613 --> 02:13:04,881
I thought that was...

2675
02:13:04,882 --> 02:13:06,553
the value we shared.

2676
02:13:06,853 --> 02:13:08,852
So when the word popped up,

2677
02:13:08,853 --> 02:13:10,193
I was like, "What is this?"

2678
02:13:10,292 --> 02:13:12,661
Does he know what he is talking about?

2679
02:13:12,662 --> 02:13:17,063
Is this fate doing its own thing even though he doesn't?

2680
02:13:18,502 --> 02:13:20,632
I became curious about that.

2681
02:13:20,973 --> 02:13:23,872
It looked like Yong Woo was more forward...

2682
02:13:24,072 --> 02:13:26,872
and Ji Won was torn.

2683
02:13:26,973 --> 02:13:29,842
Their meeting today must have felt like fate.

2684
02:13:29,843 --> 02:13:31,082
Perhaps...

2685
02:13:31,183 --> 02:13:33,983
they belatedly figured out that they share...

2686
02:13:34,082 --> 02:13:35,251
a connection.

2687
02:13:35,252 --> 02:13:37,853
Perhaps they rediscovered the feelings...

2688
02:13:37,952 --> 02:13:40,951
they have been suppressing.

2689
02:13:40,952 --> 02:13:43,193
No matter the meaning, there must be something.

2690
02:13:43,292 --> 02:13:46,393
People whispered among themselves, but that wasn't important.

2691
02:13:46,693 --> 02:13:49,233
I have a question for Jae Hyung.

2692
02:13:50,563 --> 02:13:52,531
Which group are you in?

2693
02:13:52,532 --> 02:13:54,372
The group of 5 of the group of 4?

2694
02:13:56,843 --> 02:13:57,903
The group of five.

2695
02:14:00,313 --> 02:14:01,313
Thank you.

2696
02:14:05,613 --> 02:14:09,252
I have a question for Yong Woo.

2697
02:14:15,122 --> 02:14:18,822
Did you make up your mind?

2698
02:14:19,322 --> 02:14:23,462
If you haven't, what's the percentage in your mind?

2699
02:14:26,132 --> 02:14:27,532
If you are torn...

2700
02:14:29,303 --> 02:14:30,371
between two people,

2701
02:14:30,372 --> 02:14:34,813
what's the ratio in your mind? I want to know that.

2702
02:14:36,613 --> 02:14:38,712
I continued to be confused.

2703
02:14:38,813 --> 02:14:40,282
"What is the current situation?"

2704
02:14:40,613 --> 02:14:42,183
"What is going on?"

2705
02:14:44,523 --> 02:14:46,153
Did you make up your mind?

2706
02:14:46,353 --> 02:14:51,022
I asked him of his final decision could change,

2707
02:14:51,023 --> 02:14:53,662
and Yong Woo said, "Yes."

2708
02:14:53,763 --> 02:14:56,661
I wasn't going to ask such a question.

2709
02:14:56,662 --> 02:15:00,303
But since I was confused, I had to be very specific.

2710
02:15:04,803 --> 02:15:07,113
I will answer honestly.

2711
02:15:07,473 --> 02:15:09,343
There is 1 person, not 2 people.

2712
02:15:13,082 --> 02:15:14,952
It's either none or that person.

2713
02:15:16,252 --> 02:15:18,122
And right now,

2714
02:15:19,053 --> 02:15:21,193
my thoughts are changing from "None."

2715
02:15:22,593 --> 02:15:23,723
The ratio is changing.

2716
02:15:24,723 --> 02:15:25,723
I am leaning toward that person.

2717
02:15:31,863 --> 02:15:35,372
It was painful to see it unfold before my eyes.

2718
02:15:35,672 --> 02:15:38,273
I wouldn't have cared had it happened behind my back.

2719
02:15:38,372 --> 02:15:42,072
But I had to see it with my own eyes.

2720
02:15:42,843 --> 02:15:45,683
It was hard, and I felt betrayed.

2721
02:15:45,782 --> 02:15:47,813
He said goodbye to me.

2722
02:15:47,912 --> 02:15:50,322
His thoughts were changing from "None."

2723
02:15:50,882 --> 02:15:53,322
I could see that he made up his mind.

2724
02:15:53,422 --> 02:15:58,393
It was unexpected, but he looked so desperate...

2725
02:15:58,492 --> 02:16:01,063
that I wondered, "Is he being sincere?"

2726
02:16:01,233 --> 02:16:03,263
When he said those words,

2727
02:16:03,662 --> 02:16:05,531
I saw his nervous state...

2728
02:16:05,532 --> 02:16:07,572
which was something I had never seen before.

2729
02:16:07,933 --> 02:16:11,303
And it looked like he couldn't meet her eye.

2730
02:16:12,242 --> 02:16:16,013
I was like, "What?" To be honest, it was sudden.

2731
02:16:16,113 --> 02:16:17,113
"What is he doing?"

2732
02:16:17,114 --> 02:16:18,843
It was my way of saying to Ji Won,

2733
02:16:19,143 --> 02:16:21,513
"I am going toward you."

2734
02:16:27,123 --> 02:16:30,522
Yun Jae asked a question on Ji Won's behalf.

2735
02:16:30,523 --> 02:16:31,523
That's right.

2736
02:16:32,222 --> 02:16:34,263
I was beginning to get confused.

2737
02:16:34,593 --> 02:16:36,533
- Should I ask the question or not? - What?

2738
02:16:36,802 --> 02:16:37,933
Should I ask the question or not?

2739
02:16:38,103 --> 02:16:39,161
To Yong Woo...

2740
02:16:39,162 --> 02:16:40,571
No, ask Yun Jae.

2741
02:16:40,572 --> 02:16:41,603
- Shall I ask? - Yes.

2742
02:16:45,343 --> 02:16:47,543
- I have a question. - Okay.

2743
02:16:48,072 --> 02:16:50,043
Yong Woo.

2744
02:16:50,213 --> 02:16:51,811
- Yes? - No. I said it was Yun Jae.

2745
02:16:51,812 --> 02:16:52,843
- What? - It's Yun Jae.

2746
02:16:53,812 --> 02:16:55,311
- Oh, no. - Oh, no.

2747
02:16:55,312 --> 02:16:56,382
He made a mistake.

2748
02:16:56,383 --> 02:16:58,453
- Oh, no. It's ruined. - Oh, no.

2749
02:16:58,652 --> 02:17:00,552
Yong Woo.

2750
02:17:00,752 --> 02:17:02,491
- Yes? - No. I said it was Yun Jae.

2751
02:17:02,492 --> 02:17:03,562
- What? - It's Yun Jae.

2752
02:17:04,463 --> 02:17:05,792
- Oh, no. - Oh, no.

2753
02:17:05,793 --> 02:17:06,932
He made a mistake.

2754
02:17:06,933 --> 02:17:09,033
- Oh, no. It's ruined. - Oh, no.

2755
02:17:09,133 --> 02:17:12,433
- "I said it was Yun Jae." - How embarrassing.

2756
02:17:12,802 --> 02:17:14,373
"Ask Yun Jae."

2757
02:17:14,502 --> 02:17:15,873
"Ask Yun Jae, you punk."

2758
02:17:16,943 --> 02:17:18,773
Yong Woo.

2759
02:17:19,172 --> 02:17:20,712
- Yes? - No. I said it was Yun Jae.

2760
02:17:20,713 --> 02:17:21,713
- What? - It's Yun Jae.

2761
02:17:21,873 --> 02:17:23,383
- Yun Jae. - Tell me properly.

2762
02:17:23,943 --> 02:17:25,582
- It was an error. - Please hold on. I am sorry.

2763
02:17:25,683 --> 02:17:26,683
What did you say?

2764
02:17:26,684 --> 02:17:29,213
You startled me. Don't do that.

2765
02:17:30,953 --> 02:17:32,222
Tell me properly.

2766
02:17:34,552 --> 02:17:36,463
I won't listen. Tell him.

2767
02:17:37,222 --> 02:17:38,561
- Ask Yun Jae first. - What?

2768
02:17:38,562 --> 02:17:40,463
Weren't you going to ask Yun Jae first?

2769
02:17:41,363 --> 02:17:44,433
- What was the question? - Afterward...

2770
02:17:44,703 --> 02:17:46,203
- I forgot. I am sorry. - Yes.

2771
02:17:47,172 --> 02:17:49,372
I am sorry. I will ask again.

2772
02:17:49,373 --> 02:17:51,242
- Okay. - Yun Jae.

2773
02:17:51,802 --> 02:17:53,943
After everything,

2774
02:17:54,312 --> 02:17:58,543
is it okay to spend time getting to know you?

2775
02:17:59,043 --> 02:18:00,052
Oh, that.

2776
02:18:00,152 --> 02:18:02,312
What I want to do is have a relationship right away.

2777
02:18:03,283 --> 02:18:05,422
But that's just my opinion. I am okay with that.

2778
02:18:05,853 --> 02:18:06,853
Okay.

2779
02:18:06,854 --> 02:18:08,853
- How cute. - He is the best.

2780
02:18:08,953 --> 02:18:12,793
His answer was very manly. I liked his answer.

2781
02:18:13,392 --> 02:18:14,492
He is really manly.

2782
02:18:15,463 --> 02:18:16,533
He is the most unexpected one.

2783
02:18:16,832 --> 02:18:18,603
- Yes. Seriously. - Seriously.

2784
02:18:18,802 --> 02:18:19,873
He is the best.

2785
02:18:20,572 --> 02:18:22,633
I have a question for Se Seung.

2786
02:18:22,933 --> 02:18:25,072
After today's secret date,

2787
02:18:25,373 --> 02:18:27,411
how did your feelings change?

2788
02:18:27,412 --> 02:18:30,282
Please give me a description...

2789
02:18:30,283 --> 02:18:31,982
while looking into my eyes.

2790
02:18:32,183 --> 02:18:33,613
You really like the eye contact.

2791
02:18:36,752 --> 02:18:38,582
I went from the group of 5 to the group of 4.

2792
02:18:38,953 --> 02:18:42,193
You went from the group of 5 to the group of 4. I see.

2793
02:18:44,422 --> 02:18:47,831
It was different from what she said earlier.

2794
02:18:47,832 --> 02:18:50,033
She wanted time to get to know me,

2795
02:18:50,433 --> 02:18:52,802
so I thought that she still had feelings for me.

2796
02:18:52,902 --> 02:18:54,172
But the second answer made me think,

2797
02:18:54,273 --> 02:18:56,572
"Doesn't she want to enter a relationship with me?"

2798
02:18:56,873 --> 02:18:59,241
"Doesn't she want time to get to know me?"

2799
02:18:59,242 --> 02:19:01,843
I felt like her 1st and 2nd answers...

2800
02:19:01,943 --> 02:19:03,412
were different.

2801
02:19:03,513 --> 02:19:05,183
I wondered if she had a change of heart.

2802
02:19:05,283 --> 02:19:07,812
I was like, "What is going on? Is she playing games with me?"

2803
02:19:07,912 --> 02:19:10,883
"Why does she keep changing her stance?"

2804
02:19:10,982 --> 02:19:12,152
I had that thought.

2805
02:19:20,793 --> 02:19:22,332
- Yong Woo. - Okay.

2806
02:19:22,562 --> 02:19:25,703
After the secret date,

2807
02:19:27,332 --> 02:19:30,402
did your feelings change big time?

2808
02:19:35,072 --> 02:19:37,242
You keep making me say, "Yes."

2809
02:19:49,652 --> 02:19:50,662
"Yes?"

2810
02:19:54,363 --> 02:19:56,863
I tried not to think about Cho A.

2811
02:19:57,203 --> 02:19:59,433
It felt like that time was behind me.

2812
02:19:59,533 --> 02:20:01,972
I was thankful to Cheol Hyeon for asking me that question.

2813
02:20:02,302 --> 02:20:04,372
I could express my feelings once more...

2814
02:20:04,373 --> 02:20:05,502
without using one of my chances.

2815
02:20:10,683 --> 02:20:13,853
I have a question for Ji Won.

2816
02:20:14,312 --> 02:20:16,082
After the secret date,

2817
02:20:16,353 --> 02:20:20,193
was the change in your heart a good thing or a bad thing?

2818
02:20:27,933 --> 02:20:31,802
I think it's a good thing to consider.

2819
02:20:33,332 --> 02:20:36,603
But it filled my head with many complex thoughts.

2820
02:20:37,672 --> 02:20:38,672
Let's change the question.

2821
02:20:39,502 --> 02:20:40,572
Let's change the question.

2822
02:20:41,273 --> 02:20:42,843
Whose question? Mine? Let's talk later.

2823
02:20:43,412 --> 02:20:46,853
Compared to before,

2824
02:20:47,213 --> 02:20:51,422
I'm losing more energy emotionally.

2825
02:20:59,023 --> 02:21:00,033
What?

2826
02:21:00,433 --> 02:21:02,332
She isn't sure if she is going to choose you.

2827
02:21:03,703 --> 02:21:05,001
One last time,

2828
02:21:05,002 --> 02:21:07,071
- shall we have time to discuss? - Doesn't Jae Hyung need to go?

2829
02:21:07,072 --> 02:21:08,432
- I need to ask a question for him. - Jae Hyung.

2830
02:21:08,433 --> 02:21:10,372
- What was it? - I...

2831
02:21:10,373 --> 02:21:11,373
What was it?

2832
02:21:15,072 --> 02:21:18,382
I will ask Ji Won a question on Jae Hyung's behalf.

2833
02:21:18,383 --> 02:21:19,383
Okay.

2834
02:21:19,384 --> 02:21:22,453
Regarding the final decision, are you torn between two people?

2835
02:21:23,013 --> 02:21:24,321
Or are you considering "Yes" or "No..."

2836
02:21:24,322 --> 02:21:26,023
about one person in your mind?

2837
02:21:29,853 --> 02:21:31,721
That's the question you should ask.

2838
02:21:31,722 --> 02:21:32,922
Se Seung.

2839
02:21:33,293 --> 02:21:35,262
It's no wonder her name contains "Seung," which means "Victory."

2840
02:21:35,263 --> 02:21:37,331
Seriously. If I have a daughter, I will name her Se Seung.

2841
02:21:37,332 --> 02:21:38,702
- Se Seung. - Same here.

2842
02:21:38,703 --> 02:21:39,703
Then she will be that smart.

2843
02:21:39,704 --> 02:21:41,471
- It's a definite question. - That's incredible.

2844
02:21:41,472 --> 02:21:44,671
I will ask Ji Won a question on Jae Hyung's behalf.

2845
02:21:44,672 --> 02:21:45,672
Okay.

2846
02:21:45,673 --> 02:21:48,742
Regarding the final decision, are you torn between two people?

2847
02:21:49,312 --> 02:21:50,782
Or are you considering "Yes" or "No..."

2848
02:21:50,783 --> 02:21:52,283
about one person in your mind?

2849
02:21:56,312 --> 02:21:57,383
My goodness.

2850
02:21:58,453 --> 02:22:00,921
Judging by the flow of questions...

2851
02:22:00,922 --> 02:22:03,892
between Ji Won and Yong Woo,

2852
02:22:04,162 --> 02:22:07,232
I became certain that there was something between them.

2853
02:22:07,593 --> 02:22:11,132
I wanted to see how much of a chance...

2854
02:22:11,133 --> 02:22:12,533
Yong Woo had.

2855
02:22:14,033 --> 02:22:15,033
It's a matter of a person.

2856
02:22:17,873 --> 02:22:22,072
I think I have three options.

2857
02:22:23,642 --> 02:22:26,513
There are "No" and two people.

2858
02:22:29,912 --> 02:22:31,783
What is going on? What happened?

2859
02:22:32,582 --> 02:22:34,792
Yong Woo expressed his feelings for Ji Won,

2860
02:22:34,793 --> 02:22:36,052
and Ji Won got wavered.

2861
02:22:40,062 --> 02:22:42,391
During the secret date,

2862
02:22:42,392 --> 02:22:44,062
I developed strong feelings for Ji Won.

2863
02:22:44,162 --> 02:22:47,033
I became certain...

2864
02:22:47,232 --> 02:22:50,302
and thought Ji Won was the one. It put me in a good mood.

2865
02:22:50,502 --> 02:22:53,773
I thought she would be torn between choosing me and no one.

2866
02:22:53,812 --> 02:22:54,911
A day before the final decision,

2867
02:22:54,912 --> 02:22:57,812
someone suddenly entered the picture...

2868
02:22:58,082 --> 02:23:00,082
and shook her up.

2869
02:23:00,383 --> 02:23:02,052
It made me a bit...

2870
02:23:03,013 --> 02:23:05,523
Even regarding Yong Woo...

2871
02:23:05,822 --> 02:23:09,752
Through a conversation with Cho A,

2872
02:23:09,992 --> 02:23:13,592
I understood that Yong Woo could be confused.

2873
02:23:13,593 --> 02:23:15,562
But his direction suddenly changed.

2874
02:23:16,162 --> 02:23:18,532
I don't know if he has an ulterior motive...

2875
02:23:18,533 --> 02:23:20,273
or if he actually changed his mind.

2876
02:23:20,572 --> 02:23:22,033
I don't know about that.

2877
02:23:22,133 --> 02:23:23,972
I went through so much.

2878
02:23:24,072 --> 02:23:28,013
I struggled because it took me a long time to make up my mind.

2879
02:23:28,373 --> 02:23:30,082
But Yong Woo suddenly...

2880
02:23:31,082 --> 02:23:33,512
He suddenly went, "This is how I feel."

2881
02:23:33,513 --> 02:23:34,911
His feelings changed fast.

2882
02:23:34,912 --> 02:23:37,382
For over two weeks that led up to the Singapore trip,

2883
02:23:37,383 --> 02:23:38,383
he liked Cho A.

2884
02:23:38,384 --> 02:23:40,922
Is it possible to change your mind so suddenly upon coming here?

2885
02:23:41,252 --> 02:23:43,962
At that moment, I questioned...

2886
02:23:43,963 --> 02:23:44,963
his sincerity.

2887
02:23:50,263 --> 02:23:52,532
Let's take another break.

2888
02:23:52,533 --> 02:23:53,533
- Okay. - Okay.

2889
02:23:54,302 --> 02:23:58,142
(It's time to discuss the final question.)

2890
02:24:04,183 --> 02:24:05,783
Which part...

2891
02:24:06,242 --> 02:24:09,581
Jae Hyung, I don't want to ask a question for myself.

2892
02:24:09,582 --> 02:24:11,052
Do you want to use both questions on Ji Won?

2893
02:24:11,152 --> 02:24:13,352
During the date,

2894
02:24:13,353 --> 02:24:16,422
sparks flew between Yong Woo and Ji Won.

2895
02:24:16,623 --> 02:24:17,822
- When? - Today.

2896
02:24:19,992 --> 02:24:21,332
I...

2897
02:24:25,002 --> 02:24:27,432
Gosh, that was an honest reaction.

2898
02:24:27,433 --> 02:24:29,132
One more time.

2899
02:24:29,133 --> 02:24:30,972
This is My Sibling's Romance.

2900
02:24:31,742 --> 02:24:32,972
Boom! Gosh!

2901
02:24:33,742 --> 02:24:35,812
- Seriously. - Even at that moment,

2902
02:24:35,912 --> 02:24:37,613
they were siblings.

2903
02:24:38,982 --> 02:24:40,152
He was too close.

2904
02:24:43,113 --> 02:24:45,382
During the date,

2905
02:24:45,383 --> 02:24:48,422
sparks flew between Yong Woo and Ji Won.

2906
02:24:48,623 --> 02:24:49,822
- When? - Today.

2907
02:24:52,222 --> 02:24:55,433
I want to know if he really had a change...

2908
02:24:56,093 --> 02:24:57,703
in his feelings.

2909
02:24:58,162 --> 02:25:00,671
Did Yong Woo have a change in his feelings?

2910
02:25:00,672 --> 02:25:02,972
Listen. You need to think about Yong Woo's question.

2911
02:25:03,072 --> 02:25:06,273
He asked her if she believed in fate.

2912
02:25:06,373 --> 02:25:07,572
She talked about fate with me as well.

2913
02:25:08,373 --> 02:25:09,373
Really?

2914
02:25:09,374 --> 02:25:10,943
We talked about how both of us were fatalists.

2915
02:25:12,783 --> 02:25:15,252
But that question came from Yong Woo.

2916
02:25:17,123 --> 02:25:19,052
It could be a general question.

2917
02:25:19,552 --> 02:25:21,421
You should look into your heart.

2918
02:25:21,422 --> 02:25:22,651
At this point,

2919
02:25:22,652 --> 02:25:25,892
are your feelings deep enough to try to change Ji Won's mind?

2920
02:25:26,963 --> 02:25:28,932
Perhaps you aren't interested in her due to the recent changes.

2921
02:25:28,933 --> 02:25:30,133
Follow your heart.

2922
02:25:30,533 --> 02:25:32,562
You know, it is annoying.

2923
02:25:32,963 --> 02:25:36,072
Annoyance is bubbling up inside me.

2924
02:25:36,402 --> 02:25:37,902
That's totally how I feel right now.

2925
02:25:39,902 --> 02:25:42,672
I don't want to try anything.

2926
02:25:44,812 --> 02:25:47,213
- But this is the last round. - Right.

2927
02:25:47,353 --> 02:25:49,353
Let's see to whom Yun Jae asks the question.

2928
02:25:49,912 --> 02:25:50,953
Let's decide then.

2929
02:25:52,722 --> 02:25:54,353
- How about you? - Right.

2930
02:25:54,722 --> 02:25:55,853
What should I ask?

2931
02:25:56,693 --> 02:25:57,863
Ask Yong Woo a question.

2932
02:25:59,623 --> 02:26:02,062
It was just a happening. An annoying happening.

2933
02:26:03,193 --> 02:26:04,402
Ask Ji Won...

2934
02:26:04,603 --> 02:26:06,633
if she knows that Yong Woo had a secret date with you as well.

2935
02:26:08,332 --> 02:26:09,332
No.

2936
02:26:11,043 --> 02:26:12,043
I don't want to do that.

2937
02:26:12,043 --> 02:26:13,043
Would you please ask?

2938
02:26:17,082 --> 02:26:19,382
- Oh, no. - Please do that once.

2939
02:26:19,383 --> 02:26:20,383
It's a war.

2940
02:26:21,552 --> 02:26:22,652
How are the two of them so cute?

2941
02:26:23,113 --> 02:26:24,152
Would you please ask?

2942
02:26:25,552 --> 02:26:28,193
What you want isn't there.

2943
02:26:29,353 --> 02:26:31,322
But that question will make me look like a fool.

2944
02:26:31,793 --> 02:26:33,391
People will know that I mistook the situation.

2945
02:26:33,392 --> 02:26:35,293
You can hide that fact.

2946
02:26:35,492 --> 02:26:37,831
We could choose up to 2 people, and he chose 2 people...

2947
02:26:37,832 --> 02:26:38,832
instead of one.

2948
02:26:38,833 --> 02:26:42,302
I want to ask him why he chose me for the secret date.

2949
02:26:42,502 --> 02:26:43,801
But I already know the answer.

2950
02:26:43,802 --> 02:26:46,572
Say it in front of people.

2951
02:26:47,572 --> 02:26:48,742
I don't want to go that far.

2952
02:26:52,312 --> 02:26:54,352
- I won't do that. - What will you ask then?

2953
02:26:54,353 --> 02:26:56,412
- Seriously. - So say it.

2954
02:26:56,713 --> 02:26:58,552
I don't want to do that.

2955
02:26:59,152 --> 02:27:01,992
How am I supposed to do that? It's like asking for a fight.

2956
02:27:02,093 --> 02:27:04,023
- I don't want to do that. - What will you ask then?

2957
02:27:04,623 --> 02:27:06,363
During the three weeks...

2958
02:27:09,793 --> 02:27:12,703
It's like locking him up in a cage and beating him up.

2959
02:27:13,562 --> 02:27:15,932
He could have deep thoughts about that.

2960
02:27:15,933 --> 02:27:17,501
I don't think he will give a deep answer.

2961
02:27:17,502 --> 02:27:18,502
No, he won't.

2962
02:27:18,503 --> 02:27:19,642
- Seriously. - That's why I want to ask.

2963
02:27:20,943 --> 02:27:22,312
I want to see if it will show.

2964
02:27:22,412 --> 02:27:24,383
After saying that she wanted to get to know me,

2965
02:27:24,982 --> 02:27:26,943
she said that she went from the group of 5 to 4.

2966
02:27:28,752 --> 02:27:29,752
So...

2967
02:27:29,753 --> 02:27:31,283
That means she might not choose anyone.

2968
02:27:33,552 --> 02:27:35,992
Shall I ask her if she won't choose anyone?

2969
02:27:37,523 --> 02:27:40,222
- "Will you not choose anyone?" - She might say, "No."

2970
02:27:40,332 --> 02:27:43,332
- Oh, no. - Jung Sub made her misunderstand.

2971
02:27:43,433 --> 02:27:46,132
I guess Jung Sub really didn't mean it like that.

2972
02:27:46,133 --> 02:27:47,331
- No. - I guess not.

2973
02:27:47,332 --> 02:27:50,203
- It was miscommunication. - He doesn't even understand.

2974
02:27:50,642 --> 02:27:52,943
He doesn't even understand why she is being like that.

2975
02:27:53,043 --> 02:27:55,472
Shall I ask her if she won't choose anyone?

2976
02:28:04,982 --> 02:28:07,222
Didn't her mind change too fast?

2977
02:28:07,322 --> 02:28:10,023
Didn't her mind change too fast?

2978
02:28:10,722 --> 02:28:11,892
- Who? - Se Seung.

2979
02:28:13,062 --> 02:28:14,532
Just what did you talk about?

2980
02:28:14,533 --> 02:28:17,462
She just asked me if I thought about the meaning...

2981
02:28:17,463 --> 02:28:18,633
of the final decision.

2982
02:28:18,732 --> 02:28:21,273
I took it as the conclusion of the shoot,

2983
02:28:21,603 --> 02:28:23,801
but Se Seung thought about the actual relationship.

2984
02:28:23,802 --> 02:28:27,071
I told her that we should take time to get to know each other...

2985
02:28:27,072 --> 02:28:28,613
after the final decision.

2986
02:28:30,312 --> 02:28:32,312
Then she gave up.

2987
02:28:33,142 --> 02:28:35,283
Her stance came...

2988
02:28:35,383 --> 02:28:38,383
from the conclusion she reached...

2989
02:28:38,482 --> 02:28:40,552
from the attitude you have shown so far.

2990
02:28:40,892 --> 02:28:42,052
Can't you put it nicely?

2991
02:28:46,193 --> 02:28:48,193
- What? - Can't you put it nicely?

2992
02:28:48,392 --> 02:28:49,392
Why?

2993
02:28:49,793 --> 02:28:51,702
When I give advice,

2994
02:28:51,703 --> 02:28:53,933
I tend to attack with facts.

2995
02:28:54,033 --> 02:28:56,231
He told me not to talk like that...

2996
02:28:56,232 --> 02:28:58,502
with a serious look on his face.

2997
02:28:58,603 --> 02:28:59,802
He asked me to put it nicely.

2998
02:28:59,902 --> 02:29:01,013
It was his first time to do that.

2999
02:29:01,312 --> 02:29:02,512
I was a bit surprised.

3000
02:29:02,513 --> 02:29:04,883
But I pretended otherwise since I was his big sister.

3001
02:29:07,953 --> 02:29:09,213
It's better for me to do it, right?

3002
02:29:10,982 --> 02:29:12,721
I get the hang of the situation.

3003
02:29:12,722 --> 02:29:15,093
- Do I seem like a bad person? - What?

3004
02:29:15,392 --> 02:29:18,391
It isn't bad to be torn between many options, right?

3005
02:29:18,392 --> 02:29:20,593
It isn't bad. It can't be helped.

3006
02:29:22,562 --> 02:29:25,662
Come up with a question that will ease your thoughts.

3007
02:29:25,763 --> 02:29:26,902
I will help you.

3008
02:29:27,433 --> 02:29:28,502
What should I do?

3009
02:29:31,472 --> 02:29:33,272
My face is about to explode.

3010
02:29:33,273 --> 02:29:35,912
Why do you... I understand.

3011
02:29:36,742 --> 02:29:38,512
- You suddenly fell for him. - What?

3012
02:29:38,513 --> 02:29:39,543
You suddenly fell for him.

3013
02:29:42,412 --> 02:29:44,882
All right. I am exhausted now.

3014
02:29:44,883 --> 02:29:45,883
(She wipes sweat from his face.)

3015
02:29:46,152 --> 02:29:47,152
Shall we go home?

3016
02:29:47,793 --> 02:29:51,023
My chair doesn't have a back, so I can't collapse.

3017
02:29:51,193 --> 02:29:52,193
Do you want to use mine?

3018
02:29:52,293 --> 02:29:53,422
- Lean on it. - No.

3019
02:29:56,433 --> 02:29:58,302
Ji Won seemed to be very torn.

3020
02:29:58,402 --> 02:30:01,002
She couldn't help but struggle in that situation.

3021
02:30:02,133 --> 02:30:03,402
I think it's game over.

3022
02:30:04,742 --> 02:30:05,742
What do you mean?

3023
02:30:06,443 --> 02:30:08,142
His feelings changed...

3024
02:30:08,242 --> 02:30:11,183
and he is thinking about whether or not to choose that one.

3025
02:30:11,283 --> 02:30:13,482
I asked him if his feelings changed big time...

3026
02:30:13,883 --> 02:30:15,152
- after the secret date. - Yes.

3027
02:30:15,453 --> 02:30:17,322
- And he said, "Yes." - Yes.

3028
02:30:17,783 --> 02:30:20,152
It means that he fell for Ji Won.

3029
02:30:20,252 --> 02:30:24,123
I think it means that he is completely over me.

3030
02:30:25,623 --> 02:30:29,062
(Cho A becomes thoughtful for a second.)

3031
02:30:31,162 --> 02:30:32,162
So...

3032
02:30:32,232 --> 02:30:35,231
would it be bad to ask him when I made his heart flutter...

3033
02:30:35,232 --> 02:30:38,172
since things are over already?

3034
02:30:43,343 --> 02:30:44,383
In a way, yes.

3035
02:30:45,283 --> 02:30:48,311
I think Cho A was denying the reality...

3036
02:30:48,312 --> 02:30:50,213
since she didn't want to accept it.

3037
02:30:53,523 --> 02:30:55,152
- Shall we begin? - Yes.

3038
02:30:55,523 --> 02:30:56,692
- Okay. - Okay.

3039
02:30:56,693 --> 02:30:57,693
(The last questions remain.)

3040
02:31:00,123 --> 02:31:01,662
I will go.

3041
02:31:01,763 --> 02:31:03,863
I will ask a question myself.

3042
02:31:04,363 --> 02:31:06,203
It's for Jung Sub.

3043
02:31:08,273 --> 02:31:12,741
Among the things you have done in the past three weeks,

3044
02:31:12,742 --> 02:31:14,142
do you regret anything?

3045
02:31:19,183 --> 02:31:20,683
- I guess he does. - What a timing.

3046
02:31:21,052 --> 02:31:22,052
This is no joke.

3047
02:31:22,582 --> 02:31:24,453
I have no regrets.

3048
02:31:24,982 --> 02:31:28,721
So far, I did things I wanted to do...

3049
02:31:28,722 --> 02:31:31,721
and got to know people I wanted to get to know...

3050
02:31:31,722 --> 02:31:34,433
without regrets. I made unregretted decisions.

3051
02:31:38,533 --> 02:31:42,302
I asked the question thinking that he would regret today's date.

3052
02:31:42,402 --> 02:31:44,141
At this point,

3053
02:31:44,142 --> 02:31:46,272
he must have felt that other people were thinking...

3054
02:31:46,273 --> 02:31:48,843
about the future beyond the final decision.

3055
02:31:49,273 --> 02:31:52,443
"Thus, wouldn't he have regrets about today's date?"

3056
02:31:52,543 --> 02:31:53,882
I had that thought.

3057
02:31:53,883 --> 02:31:56,353
I don't understand why she asked that question.

3058
02:31:56,453 --> 02:31:57,853
I don't understand her intention.

3059
02:31:58,283 --> 02:32:00,123
I said I had no regrets...

3060
02:32:00,222 --> 02:32:03,092
because I was thinking about going on the dates,

3061
02:32:03,093 --> 02:32:04,692
fighting, making up,

3062
02:32:04,693 --> 02:32:07,263
and going on the dates again.

3063
02:32:07,633 --> 02:32:09,933
I meant that I had no regrets regarding those matters.

3064
02:32:10,033 --> 02:32:14,272
But I felt like she would get hurt...

3065
02:32:14,273 --> 02:32:19,642
no matter how I answered that question.

3066
02:32:21,843 --> 02:32:23,811
May I go next?

3067
02:32:23,812 --> 02:32:24,812
My next question...

3068
02:32:26,213 --> 02:32:28,283
is for Yong Woo.

3069
02:32:32,953 --> 02:32:35,523
You said your options were "None" and one person.

3070
02:32:36,023 --> 02:32:39,822
If you choose "None,"

3071
02:32:40,193 --> 02:32:42,433
what would be the biggest issue?

3072
02:33:01,582 --> 02:33:03,982
The biggest issue behind choosing "None?"

3073
02:33:09,052 --> 02:33:10,322
Can I give a short answer?

3074
02:33:11,322 --> 02:33:14,133
For a few days now, I thought that my decision would be "None."

3075
02:33:14,992 --> 02:33:20,972
But for the first time today, that person entered my heart.

3076
02:33:23,072 --> 02:33:25,472
So "None" is becoming less likely.

3077
02:33:27,443 --> 02:33:28,572
Was it okay?

3078
02:33:28,672 --> 02:33:30,273
- Yes. Thank you. - Okay.

3079
02:33:35,683 --> 02:33:37,113
Shall I ask Yong Woo?

3080
02:33:38,853 --> 02:33:40,921
- Me? - Shall I ask your question?

3081
02:33:40,922 --> 02:33:41,922
Why?

3082
02:33:43,353 --> 02:33:45,062
- What do you want to ask? - It's nothing.

3083
02:33:46,363 --> 02:33:49,293
Let me ask Se Seung a question.

3084
02:33:51,002 --> 02:33:56,033
In the answers you have given so far,

3085
02:33:57,603 --> 02:33:59,843
you said that you were torn about the final decision...

3086
02:34:01,043 --> 02:34:04,213
and that you had a change of heart.

3087
02:34:06,783 --> 02:34:08,552
Will you make...

3088
02:34:09,683 --> 02:34:11,822
the final decision or not?

3089
02:34:19,193 --> 02:34:20,193
I am nervous.

3090
02:34:25,263 --> 02:34:27,232
My heart is about to burst.

3091
02:34:33,343 --> 02:34:34,443
I won't.

3092
02:34:36,242 --> 02:34:37,273
What did you say?

3093
02:34:37,613 --> 02:34:38,742
It's "None."

3094
02:34:39,443 --> 02:34:40,443
None.

3095
02:34:41,183 --> 02:34:42,512
It was very shocking.

3096
02:34:42,513 --> 02:34:45,722
It sounded like a declaration of war.

3097
02:34:48,222 --> 02:34:51,263
Then I will ask the next question.

3098
02:34:52,023 --> 02:34:53,023
What?

3099
02:34:54,533 --> 02:34:56,263
I will ask my question.

3100
02:34:56,363 --> 02:34:58,602
It was Yun Ha's question just now.

3101
02:34:58,603 --> 02:35:01,773
Jung Sub asked my question just now.

3102
02:35:02,133 --> 02:35:05,442
Now, it's Jung Sub's turn. He will ask his own question.

3103
02:35:05,443 --> 02:35:06,443
- Okay. - Yes.

3104
02:35:08,572 --> 02:35:12,742
Se Seung, will you choose "None..."

3105
02:35:13,142 --> 02:35:14,752
even if I choose you?

3106
02:35:18,383 --> 02:35:19,523
Well,

3107
02:35:22,523 --> 02:35:25,322
this isn't about...

3108
02:35:27,193 --> 02:35:29,293
whether or not you will choose me.

3109
02:35:30,963 --> 02:35:34,633
The fact that the final decision held different meanings for us...

3110
02:35:36,332 --> 02:35:37,332
is the reason.

3111
02:35:44,343 --> 02:35:46,241
If the final decision...

3112
02:35:46,242 --> 02:35:48,613
means nothing to him outside the show,

3113
02:35:49,582 --> 02:35:51,922
I can't feel the sincerity...

3114
02:35:52,222 --> 02:35:54,892
in the emotions we shared.

3115
02:35:54,992 --> 02:35:58,061
How do you end the emotions you shared over three weeks...

3116
02:35:58,062 --> 02:35:59,693
right after the shoot?

3117
02:36:00,023 --> 02:36:03,193
How could you not have any thoughts about the future?

3118
02:36:03,293 --> 02:36:05,232
It was her way of saying, "No."

3119
02:36:05,332 --> 02:36:08,203
"We had different ideas about what the final decision meant."

3120
02:36:08,302 --> 02:36:10,203
"That's the reason."

3121
02:36:10,472 --> 02:36:12,702
She was saying that she won't choose me...

3122
02:36:12,703 --> 02:36:13,742
because of that.

3123
02:36:13,843 --> 02:36:16,472
Just what did they talk about for this to happen?

3124
02:36:16,843 --> 02:36:19,782
Things were great when they had a date the day before.

3125
02:36:19,783 --> 02:36:20,982
What is going on?

3126
02:36:21,252 --> 02:36:24,251
Se Seung thinks that she showed her feelings to Jung Sub...

3127
02:36:24,252 --> 02:36:27,552
and made expressions so that he wouldn't be confused.

3128
02:36:27,652 --> 02:36:29,052
But during the secret date,

3129
02:36:29,152 --> 02:36:31,463
she felt like he wasn't being sincere.

3130
02:36:31,562 --> 02:36:33,061
It hurt her feelings.

3131
02:36:33,062 --> 02:36:35,633
It seemed like she was getting ready to close her heart.

3132
02:36:42,572 --> 02:36:44,542
Oh, no. My heart dropped.

3133
02:36:44,543 --> 02:36:45,943
My goodness.

3134
02:36:46,043 --> 02:36:49,112
But you never know about Se Seung and Jung Sub.

3135
02:36:49,113 --> 02:36:51,012
They might make up once they go back to the house.

3136
02:36:51,013 --> 02:36:52,411
- No. - I think it's over for real.

3137
02:36:52,412 --> 02:36:54,482
I am certain. They can't make up at this point.

3138
02:36:54,552 --> 02:36:56,113
He hurt her feelings too much.

3139
02:36:56,283 --> 02:36:59,482
- The misunderstanding is too deep. - I know.

3140
02:37:01,693 --> 02:37:05,363
I don't know if it will be possible to do this.

3141
02:37:05,463 --> 02:37:07,561
If all of you are okay with it,

3142
02:37:07,562 --> 02:37:10,763
I want to ask a question to two people.

3143
02:37:11,203 --> 02:37:12,203
Would it be okay?

3144
02:37:12,662 --> 02:37:15,232
I want to ask a question to Yong Woo and Jae Hyung.

3145
02:37:17,133 --> 02:37:20,703
In your life, you become weak at times.

3146
02:37:20,802 --> 02:37:23,672
At your weakest,

3147
02:37:23,972 --> 02:37:26,282
do you open yourself up...

3148
02:37:26,283 --> 02:37:28,482
to your lover or friends?

3149
02:37:28,582 --> 02:37:30,453
Do you bottle things to yourself?

3150
02:37:30,953 --> 02:37:32,822
Do you try to solve things...

3151
02:37:33,453 --> 02:37:36,422
by yourself? I want to know that.

3152
02:37:38,162 --> 02:37:40,492
I asked the question...

3153
02:37:40,593 --> 02:37:43,891
in order to help Ji Won...

3154
02:37:43,892 --> 02:37:45,162
with her decision.

3155
02:37:45,533 --> 02:37:47,971
Ji Won told me...

3156
02:37:47,972 --> 02:37:49,802
that she didn't like showing her weakness.

3157
02:37:49,902 --> 02:37:53,373
She told me that she preferred solving things herself.

3158
02:37:53,572 --> 02:37:57,213
(Is there a time you become completely disarmed?)

3159
02:37:58,082 --> 02:37:59,481
(Disarmed?)

3160
02:37:59,482 --> 02:38:04,081
(I do want to find a lover who can disarm me.)

3161
02:38:04,082 --> 02:38:06,352
(I tend to put up my guard.)

3162
02:38:06,353 --> 02:38:09,093
(I am good at pretending to be strong.)

3163
02:38:09,193 --> 02:38:13,662
(I think it would be nice to have someone like that.)

3164
02:38:13,763 --> 02:38:15,792
(I may appear strong,)

3165
02:38:15,793 --> 02:38:18,301
(but there is a weak side I know about.)

3166
02:38:18,302 --> 02:38:21,302
(I want to share it and lean on the other person.)

3167
02:38:22,072 --> 02:38:27,002
(Cheol Hyeon knows that Ji Won wants to lean on someone.)

3168
02:38:27,302 --> 02:38:31,012
So that Ji Won can choose better regarding that matter,

3169
02:38:31,013 --> 02:38:35,213
I asked a question to Yong Woo and Jae Hyung.

3170
02:38:35,412 --> 02:38:37,751
I wanted to see Yong Woo's honesty.

3171
02:38:37,752 --> 02:38:41,152
I wanted to know if he really was someone Ji Won wanted to date,

3172
02:38:41,252 --> 02:38:43,152
so I asked him that question.

3173
02:38:43,252 --> 02:38:47,293
It made me think, "Did he ask the question for me?"

3174
02:38:47,392 --> 02:38:50,763
He asked the two of them to share the thoughts...

3175
02:38:50,863 --> 02:38:53,433
on the matter that was the most important to me.

3176
02:38:53,533 --> 02:38:56,801
I think he asked the question...

3177
02:38:56,802 --> 02:38:59,873
so that it would help me with my decision.

3178
02:38:59,972 --> 02:39:01,013
Jae Hyung, please go first.

3179
02:39:04,412 --> 02:39:07,513
I think I open up and lean on the others.

3180
02:39:08,582 --> 02:39:09,582
Yes.

3181
02:39:12,482 --> 02:39:16,293
I don't know if I ever talked about those things in my life.

3182
02:39:16,693 --> 02:39:18,123
I don't think I ever did.

3183
02:39:18,662 --> 02:39:21,793
Friends? Not my ex-girlfriend. My family members don't know either.

3184
02:39:22,662 --> 02:39:24,662
I took care of problems on my own.

3185
02:39:25,002 --> 02:39:27,263
But I like that side of me.

3186
02:39:28,832 --> 02:39:29,832
Okay.

3187
02:39:31,502 --> 02:39:32,972
But in the future...

3188
02:39:33,172 --> 02:39:36,613
While I spent time with everyone, I found myself a lot.

3189
02:39:36,713 --> 02:39:38,482
I am sure many people have seen it.

3190
02:39:38,783 --> 02:39:42,312
So I want to change.

3191
02:39:42,883 --> 02:39:45,982
I think that's a bit better.

3192
02:39:49,552 --> 02:39:51,062
Okay. I understand.

3193
02:39:51,992 --> 02:39:53,892
Is it over? Is it Jae Hyung's turn?

3194
02:39:54,433 --> 02:39:55,662
Do you want to go?

3195
02:39:57,332 --> 02:40:00,263
I have a question for Yong Woo.

3196
02:40:01,072 --> 02:40:04,972
Were your words and behaviours you have shown so far sincere?

3197
02:40:07,603 --> 02:40:09,972
I mean everything that happened here.

3198
02:40:17,252 --> 02:40:20,222
You siblings keep making me say, "Yes."

3199
02:40:23,353 --> 02:40:24,392
One hundred percent.

3200
02:40:29,433 --> 02:40:32,302
It occurred to me that Cho A might think this...

3201
02:40:32,402 --> 02:40:34,263
upon seeing what happened today.

3202
02:40:34,672 --> 02:40:36,672
"Perhaps he lied..."

3203
02:40:36,773 --> 02:40:39,001
"even though he liked Ji Won all along."

3204
02:40:39,002 --> 02:40:40,572
She might think that.

3205
02:40:40,672 --> 02:40:43,212
But it was never like that...

3206
02:40:43,213 --> 02:40:44,343
when I was seeing Cho A.

3207
02:40:45,013 --> 02:40:46,613
So I said "Yes" with certainty.

3208
02:40:46,943 --> 02:40:48,182
I don't know. Unfortunately,

3209
02:40:48,183 --> 02:40:51,822
I felt like he wasn't being sincere.

3210
02:40:51,922 --> 02:40:55,052
He gave an answer without looking me in the eye.

3211
02:40:55,152 --> 02:40:56,792
In a sense,

3212
02:40:56,793 --> 02:41:01,532
I should have asked a more aggressive question.

3213
02:41:01,533 --> 02:41:04,902
But I didn't do that...

3214
02:41:05,263 --> 02:41:08,933
because it would have made me look desperate.

3215
02:41:09,273 --> 02:41:12,603
(Only Jae Hyung's question remains.)

3216
02:41:13,543 --> 02:41:15,142
- Ji Won. - Yes?

3217
02:41:19,283 --> 02:41:20,642
Did your options become two people...

3218
02:41:22,013 --> 02:41:25,482
before or after today?

3219
02:41:38,302 --> 02:41:40,662
Yesterday,

3220
02:41:42,502 --> 02:41:46,302
my options were one person or "None."

3221
02:41:47,242 --> 02:41:50,843
Today, my options are two people or "None."

3222
02:41:59,283 --> 02:42:00,921
It let me know for certain...

3223
02:42:00,922 --> 02:42:03,953
that there was a conversation between her and Yong Woo.

3224
02:42:04,222 --> 02:42:08,532
I made up my mind after much struggle...

3225
02:42:08,533 --> 02:42:12,161
and expressed myself clearly.

3226
02:42:12,162 --> 02:42:14,872
The fact that she was torn between me and someone else...

3227
02:42:14,873 --> 02:42:16,572
made me flustered,

3228
02:42:17,072 --> 02:42:21,412
disappointed, and confused.

3229
02:42:25,183 --> 02:42:26,311
It felt good.

3230
02:42:26,312 --> 02:42:29,282
Everyone thought Ji Won would choose Jae Hyung...

3231
02:42:29,283 --> 02:42:31,113
or no one.

3232
02:42:31,152 --> 02:42:33,953
But I entered the options.

3233
02:42:34,052 --> 02:42:35,552
So it felt good.

3234
02:42:43,392 --> 02:42:47,332
(The Siblings' Truth or Dare ends.)

3235
02:42:47,603 --> 02:42:50,832
- I will use the restroom. - Go ahead if you need to use it.

3236
02:42:56,113 --> 02:42:57,883
- Shall we go to the first floor? - Okay.

3237
02:43:03,152 --> 02:43:04,581
Let me tell you...

3238
02:43:04,582 --> 02:43:06,652
which question I wanted to ask.

3239
02:43:06,783 --> 02:43:08,821
I wanted to ask Yong Woo...

3240
02:43:08,822 --> 02:43:10,422
if he picked me for a secret date...

3241
02:43:10,922 --> 02:43:12,822
because he wanted to gain information about you.

3242
02:43:14,593 --> 02:43:16,991
- That's the only explanation. - No way.

3243
02:43:16,992 --> 02:43:19,402
He kept asking me about you.

3244
02:43:23,273 --> 02:43:25,202
Isn't it too much?

3245
02:43:25,203 --> 02:43:29,112
I couldn't understand so many of Yong Woo's behaviours.

3246
02:43:29,113 --> 02:43:32,282
I felt like the intention behind choosing me...

3247
02:43:32,283 --> 02:43:35,212
for the secret date wasn't entirely pure.

3248
02:43:35,213 --> 02:43:37,513
He asked me questions about Jae Hyung,

3249
02:43:38,283 --> 02:43:40,821
so I felt like he was trying to dig up information.

3250
02:43:40,822 --> 02:43:43,452
It put me in a really bad mood.

3251
02:43:43,453 --> 02:43:46,123
If we try to take it in the most optimistic way,

3252
02:43:46,363 --> 02:43:49,033
Yong Woo had no direction...

3253
02:43:49,062 --> 02:43:51,433
and wanted to choose between the two of us.

3254
02:43:51,703 --> 02:43:54,161
But he went on a date with Ji Won first and sparks flew.

3255
02:43:54,162 --> 02:43:57,203
I would understand if that's the reason behind this decision.

3256
02:43:57,472 --> 02:44:01,172
But if Yong Woo chose me for a secret date as well...

3257
02:44:01,312 --> 02:44:03,311
when his heart was already decided yesterday,

3258
02:44:03,312 --> 02:44:04,683
it's really annoying.

3259
02:44:05,883 --> 02:44:08,081
When he stopped sending a message to Cho A,

3260
02:44:08,082 --> 02:44:09,353
did he start messaging Ji Won?

3261
02:44:09,582 --> 02:44:10,582
No, he didn't.

3262
02:44:10,583 --> 02:44:12,722
He was neutral back then. He sent it to Yun Ha.

3263
02:44:14,222 --> 02:44:17,221
If you try to take it in an optimistic way, you could.

3264
02:44:17,222 --> 02:44:18,363
But it doesn't make sense.

3265
02:44:18,793 --> 02:44:19,863
It doesn't, right?

3266
02:44:20,263 --> 02:44:22,693
I don't think Ji Won is at fault.

3267
02:44:23,033 --> 02:44:24,902
It isn't a crime to have a change of heart.

3268
02:44:25,232 --> 02:44:26,963
For Ji Won, it really happened today.

3269
02:44:27,363 --> 02:44:29,402
- It can't be helped. - Your voice is too loud.

3270
02:44:30,972 --> 02:44:32,472
Your voice is too loud.

3271
02:44:35,172 --> 02:44:37,312
I am shocked about Yong Woo.

3272
02:44:38,082 --> 02:44:40,883
I might be mistaken.

3273
02:44:43,252 --> 02:44:44,311
What are you going to do?

3274
02:44:44,312 --> 02:44:46,783
I feel down too.

3275
02:44:47,283 --> 02:44:48,952
Suddenly,

3276
02:44:48,953 --> 02:44:51,252
someone I had never imagined...

3277
02:44:51,992 --> 02:44:53,463
asked you questions.

3278
02:44:54,933 --> 02:44:56,193
I was so taken aback.

3279
02:44:56,793 --> 02:44:58,062
This wasn't in my picture.

3280
02:44:58,232 --> 02:45:01,901
My sibling received messages from Jae Hyung and Cheol Hyeon.

3281
02:45:01,902 --> 02:45:05,642
I thought only two teams would ask us questions.

3282
02:45:05,742 --> 02:45:08,471
Suddenly, an unexpected team...

3283
02:45:08,472 --> 02:45:09,613
asked us questions.

3284
02:45:10,013 --> 02:45:11,013
I was very surprised.

3285
02:45:11,172 --> 02:45:14,952
I didn't think that Yong Woo should ask us questions.

3286
02:45:14,953 --> 02:45:16,651
Yong Woo never chose Ji Won...

3287
02:45:16,652 --> 02:45:18,783
during my time on the show.

3288
02:45:19,023 --> 02:45:22,352
But Yong Woo suddenly asked us questions.

3289
02:45:22,353 --> 02:45:25,363
"Yong Woo and Ji Won had a secret date."

3290
02:45:25,623 --> 02:45:29,232
"That led to a problem." I had that thought.

3291
02:45:34,802 --> 02:45:35,902
Shall we have a drink later?

3292
02:45:37,002 --> 02:45:39,773
- I feel like I am the root... - What?

3293
02:45:40,472 --> 02:45:44,142
I feel like I am the root of all negative emotions...

3294
02:45:44,572 --> 02:45:46,082
in here.

3295
02:45:48,082 --> 02:45:49,652
It can't be helped, okay?

3296
02:45:50,183 --> 02:45:51,623
Yun Ha, I am ruined.

3297
02:45:51,953 --> 02:45:53,321
- What? - I am ruined.

3298
02:45:53,322 --> 02:45:54,651
- Why? - I am ruined.

3299
02:45:54,652 --> 02:45:55,853
I lost my direction.

3300
02:45:57,752 --> 02:45:59,822
She gave up.

3301
02:46:01,593 --> 02:46:03,033
I am so flustered.

3302
02:46:03,162 --> 02:46:04,902
- What? - I am so flustered.

3303
02:46:07,062 --> 02:46:08,301
"How did this happen?"

3304
02:46:08,302 --> 02:46:11,402
I was hung up on that thought.

3305
02:46:16,843 --> 02:46:22,581
(You have 1 day before making the final decision.)

3306
02:46:22,582 --> 02:46:25,251
(This is the last message after the 3-week journey.)

3307
02:46:25,252 --> 02:46:27,922
(Who made your heart flutter today?)

3308
02:46:32,822 --> 02:46:39,062
(At the crossroads, to whom will they deliver their feelings?)

3309
02:46:41,873 --> 02:46:45,171
I thought things wouldn't work out between me and Se Seung,

3310
02:46:45,172 --> 02:46:48,172
so I just wrote I wanted to say to her.

3311
02:46:48,443 --> 02:46:50,342
(To Se Seung: Everyone takes the final decision differently.)

3312
02:46:50,343 --> 02:46:52,342
(I think I also did a bad job of expressing myself.)

3313
02:46:52,343 --> 02:46:54,241
(But I still want to get to know you even after this ends.)

3314
02:46:54,242 --> 02:46:56,182
(Everything we did together continues to be a good memory.)

3315
02:46:56,183 --> 02:46:57,783
(No matter what you decide, I will take it well, Se Seung.)

3316
02:46:58,013 --> 02:47:01,992
"I still want to get to know you even after this ends."

3317
02:47:02,422 --> 02:47:04,123
I gave her certainty.

3318
02:47:04,193 --> 02:47:06,922
(Jung Sub wanted to deliver his sincerity and certainty.)

3319
02:47:07,062 --> 02:47:09,161
I think...

3320
02:47:09,162 --> 02:47:12,332
Se Seung will send, "Adios."

3321
02:47:18,742 --> 02:47:20,302
I sent it to Yun Ha.

3322
02:47:20,642 --> 02:47:23,672
(To Yun Ha: I will approach you slowly.)

3323
02:47:23,843 --> 02:47:26,682
She asked me if I wanted to date her and get to know her...

3324
02:47:26,683 --> 02:47:28,952
right away after the show.

3325
02:47:28,953 --> 02:47:31,852
Without hesitation, I answered, "Right away."

3326
02:47:31,853 --> 02:47:33,721
Afterward, I realized...

3327
02:47:33,722 --> 02:47:36,023
that my answer might have pressured her.

3328
02:47:36,123 --> 02:47:37,452
I wanted to apologize...

3329
02:47:37,453 --> 02:47:41,263
because I might have pressured her when she wanted to take things slow.

3330
02:47:41,593 --> 02:47:44,192
Of course, I sent it to Yun Jae.

3331
02:47:44,193 --> 02:47:47,203
I thanked him for expressing his feelings.

3332
02:47:48,162 --> 02:47:50,171
I sent a sweet emoji...

3333
02:47:50,172 --> 02:47:52,543
because I wanted to express my feelings too.

3334
02:47:56,373 --> 02:47:59,412
It was a moment I wanted to avoid.

3335
02:47:59,812 --> 02:48:01,412
I didn't want to send a message.

3336
02:48:01,683 --> 02:48:03,811
(To Jae Hyung:)

3337
02:48:03,812 --> 02:48:05,922
(I won't put much meaning behind my decision tomorrow.)

3338
02:48:06,052 --> 02:48:09,152
I didn't want to put much meaning behind my decision.

3339
02:48:09,322 --> 02:48:10,721
It was for myself,

3340
02:48:10,722 --> 02:48:13,592
but it was also my last consideration for Jae Hyung.

3341
02:48:13,593 --> 02:48:17,033
I thought he was very burdened by me.

3342
02:48:20,603 --> 02:48:23,572
I had nothing to say to Yong Woo.

3343
02:48:24,033 --> 02:48:25,772
But it said, "This is the last message."

3344
02:48:25,773 --> 02:48:27,472
"The last" part...

3345
02:48:28,142 --> 02:48:29,873
affected me a lot.

3346
02:48:30,412 --> 02:48:32,442
Despite the hatred and anger,

3347
02:48:32,443 --> 02:48:36,811
I didn't want to express them in the last message.

3348
02:48:36,812 --> 02:48:40,152
Hatred is the heaviest and the most tiring.

3349
02:48:40,552 --> 02:48:43,952
It was hard for me to have such emotions.

3350
02:48:43,953 --> 02:48:45,363
I decided to understand him...

3351
02:48:45,722 --> 02:48:47,991
and focus on the good things.

3352
02:48:47,992 --> 02:48:50,293
He said he was sincere back then.

3353
02:48:50,892 --> 02:48:54,263
I organized the good times we had and things I was grateful for...

3354
02:48:54,703 --> 02:48:57,231
and delivered the message.

3355
02:48:57,232 --> 02:48:58,502
(Thank you for helping me feel precious emotions.)

3356
02:49:01,873 --> 02:49:05,812
I wrote the message with all of my heart.

3357
02:49:06,412 --> 02:49:10,513
Because of my action, so much confusion ensued.

3358
02:49:11,082 --> 02:49:14,552
I actually feel bad about that.

3359
02:49:15,052 --> 02:49:17,092
But had I passed by this opportunity...

3360
02:49:17,093 --> 02:49:19,593
in order to keep things peaceful, I would have regretted it.

3361
02:49:20,222 --> 02:49:21,992
So I plucked up my courage this time.

3362
02:49:22,892 --> 02:49:25,262
(To Ji Won: Hi, my first message came at the last moment.)

3363
02:49:25,263 --> 02:49:27,661
(After many happenings and thoughts, I have a small present for you.)

3364
02:49:27,662 --> 02:49:30,472
(See you tomorrow. Good night.)

3365
02:49:30,703 --> 02:49:35,113
It was my first and last message to Ji Won.

3366
02:49:35,742 --> 02:49:36,843
My heart felt light.

3367
02:49:37,543 --> 02:49:39,513
I had done everything I needed to do.

3368
02:49:39,883 --> 02:49:40,942
(To Ji Won: I understood.)

3369
02:49:40,943 --> 02:49:43,152
To Ji Won, I sent, "I understood."

3370
02:49:43,783 --> 02:49:46,623
When Ji Won and I talked during the secret date,

3371
02:49:47,052 --> 02:49:48,652
I sympathized with her a lot.

3372
02:49:49,093 --> 02:49:52,293
I understood her words and emotions.

3373
02:49:53,963 --> 02:49:57,492
I sent Ji Won, "Let's do a good job of climbing over the big mountain."

3374
02:49:58,463 --> 02:50:00,133
During the secret date,

3375
02:50:00,562 --> 02:50:02,532
we talked about the big mountain...

3376
02:50:02,533 --> 02:50:04,472
that remained.

3377
02:50:04,633 --> 02:50:08,672
(Let's do a good job of climbing over the big mountain.)

3378
02:50:18,283 --> 02:50:20,853
She was torn,

3379
02:50:21,123 --> 02:50:24,092
so I didn't want to burden her.

3380
02:50:24,093 --> 02:50:27,391
"This night is a big mountain for the both of us."

3381
02:50:27,392 --> 02:50:30,933
"Let's climb it well as we talked about."

3382
02:50:33,463 --> 02:50:36,572
(Ji Won hasn't sent the message yet.)

3383
02:50:39,402 --> 02:50:41,672
I was very confused.

3384
02:50:43,812 --> 02:50:45,883
I am really curious about Ji Won's decision.

3385
02:50:46,043 --> 02:50:47,882
- Right. - Who will it be?

3386
02:50:47,883 --> 02:50:50,012
It's a very important message.

3387
02:50:50,013 --> 02:50:51,352
Whom will she message?

3388
02:50:51,353 --> 02:50:52,952
I think she will send it to Yong Woo.

3389
02:50:52,953 --> 02:50:54,822
No, she will send it to Jae Hyung.

3390
02:50:56,322 --> 02:51:00,463
(After much consideration, she writes the message.)

3391
02:51:10,832 --> 02:51:11,972
Are you done?

3392
02:51:12,443 --> 02:51:13,502
Well done.

3393
02:51:14,502 --> 02:51:18,843
(Everyone sent the last message.)

3394
02:51:19,513 --> 02:51:21,412
Cheol Hyeon will swim here later.

3395
02:51:22,783 --> 02:51:24,782
I will do it later. I am studying the spots.

3396
02:51:24,783 --> 02:51:26,883
I don't know if I will swim at a corner or here.

3397
02:51:27,152 --> 02:51:28,651
- Dad. - He is like Dad.

3398
02:51:28,652 --> 02:51:30,252
Cheol Hyeon, you are like our dad.

3399
02:51:30,322 --> 02:51:31,491
- Really? - Yes.

3400
02:51:31,492 --> 02:51:32,963
We said that from the start.

3401
02:51:33,123 --> 02:51:34,362
Our dad is a lot like you.

3402
02:51:34,363 --> 02:51:36,432
- Books. - He likes books too.

3403
02:51:36,433 --> 02:51:37,533
He is sentimental.

3404
02:51:38,062 --> 02:51:39,933
I should meet your dad.

3405
02:51:40,463 --> 02:51:41,901
I hope the meeting will take place.

3406
02:51:41,902 --> 02:51:43,332
There are many people I need to avoid today.

3407
02:51:43,603 --> 02:51:45,302
But you are solid about your decision.

3408
02:51:46,742 --> 02:51:47,943
Ji Won?

3409
02:51:48,642 --> 02:51:50,172
It must be quite a headache.

3410
02:51:50,543 --> 02:51:52,311
You are the one to speak.

3411
02:51:52,312 --> 02:51:53,712
But I...

3412
02:51:53,713 --> 02:51:56,581
I would rather worry about someone else.

3413
02:51:56,582 --> 02:51:58,152
- So it's a relief. - Yes.

3414
02:51:58,383 --> 02:51:59,552
This is...

3415
02:52:00,982 --> 02:52:02,052
It's a message.

3416
02:52:04,123 --> 02:52:05,262
(Today's messages will be delivered after the final decision.)

3417
02:52:05,263 --> 02:52:06,792
My goodness.

3418
02:52:06,793 --> 02:52:10,633
(All schedules of the day have been concluded.)

3419
02:52:16,572 --> 02:52:17,832
What?

3420
02:52:18,603 --> 02:52:22,613
I wanted to send and receive the feelings.

3421
02:52:22,843 --> 02:52:26,113
I was disappointed that it got cut off.

3422
02:52:27,283 --> 02:52:28,582
I guess it's fate.

3423
02:52:29,383 --> 02:52:30,582
I can't know that for now.

3424
02:52:36,992 --> 02:52:38,523
I didn't know that they would be saved for later.

3425
02:52:39,793 --> 02:52:41,792
I wasn't nervous at all.

3426
02:52:41,793 --> 02:52:43,963
I was certain that Yun Jae sent it to me.

3427
02:52:49,933 --> 02:52:51,802
I mean...

3428
02:52:52,543 --> 02:52:54,671
In the past, the messages got delivered right away.

3429
02:52:54,672 --> 02:52:56,613
Why wasn't that the case this time?

3430
02:52:57,172 --> 02:52:58,273
It was too much.

3431
02:52:59,013 --> 02:53:00,912
I was so frustrated.

3432
02:53:01,482 --> 02:53:02,613
It's cruel.

3433
02:53:04,052 --> 02:53:06,052
I didn't care that much.

3434
02:53:12,463 --> 02:53:16,033
(Everyone's feelings have been saved.)

3435
02:53:16,433 --> 02:53:19,001
(Just what did the two of you talk about?)

3436
02:53:19,002 --> 02:53:21,501
("Did you think about the future beyond the final decision?")

3437
02:53:21,502 --> 02:53:23,901
(He said he never thought about that.)

3438
02:53:23,902 --> 02:53:27,641
(I am telling you about my direction on purpose.)

3439
02:53:27,642 --> 02:53:31,741
(I already made a decision.)

3440
02:53:31,742 --> 02:53:33,883
(The situation was a bit complex.)

3441
02:53:34,283 --> 02:53:37,751
(I had the most amount of fun with Jae Hyung.)

3442
02:53:37,752 --> 02:53:42,321
(I rarely had alone time with Yong Woo.)

3443
02:53:42,322 --> 02:53:44,251
(Do you know what Ji Won's decision will be?)

3444
02:53:44,252 --> 02:53:45,622
(I don't know. I don't know that.)

3445
02:53:45,623 --> 02:53:47,462
(I am not talking about other people.)

3446
02:53:47,463 --> 02:53:48,661
(I am asking you to make up your mind.)

3447
02:53:48,662 --> 02:53:50,991
(I just want you to put yourself first.)

3448
02:53:50,992 --> 02:53:52,401
(Did you think it through?)

3449
02:53:52,402 --> 02:53:54,231
(Yes, I did.)

3450
02:53:54,232 --> 02:53:57,872
(Was there a specific event that made you fall for Ji Won?)

3451
02:53:57,873 --> 02:53:59,071
(I am curious about it.)

3452
02:53:59,072 --> 02:54:01,802
(How much weight do your feelings have?)

3453
02:54:02,312 --> 02:54:03,372
(More than I thought,)

3454
02:54:03,373 --> 02:54:05,782
(the feelings came at an accelerated speed.)

3455
02:54:05,783 --> 02:54:07,882
(I must be insane. Seriously.)

3456
02:54:07,883 --> 02:54:09,853
(He is exactly like me.)

3457
02:54:10,312 --> 02:54:14,453
(They wrap up the stories that built up over 3 weeks.)

3458
02:54:18,252 --> 02:54:20,891
(The day of the final decision)

3459
02:54:20,892 --> 02:54:23,363
(I think I am a bit nervous.)

3460
02:54:23,793 --> 02:54:27,603
(From the beginning to the end, I have been sincere.)

3461
02:54:32,043 --> 02:54:36,273
(It's time to confess your feelings.)
