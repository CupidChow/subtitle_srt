1
00:00:00,063 --> 00:00:01,063
(Screaming)

2
00:00:02,803 --> 00:00:04,001
(Amazing.)

3
00:00:04,002 --> 00:00:05,542
(Se Seung, you can do it.)

4
00:00:05,543 --> 00:00:08,742
(After the Gangwon Province date divided into two groups,)

5
00:00:08,743 --> 00:00:12,312
(the siblings gathered in one place.)

6
00:00:12,313 --> 00:00:16,412
(There was a man waiting for them in secret here.)

7
00:00:16,453 --> 00:00:17,781
(Surprised)

8
00:00:17,782 --> 00:00:20,082
(The stranger got everyone's attention on him.)

9
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:21,282
(Like a musical actor.)

10
00:00:21,283 --> 00:00:23,551
(He looked at us for 3 seconds and came down.)

11
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:25,021
(He appeared like Gatsby.)

12
00:00:25,022 --> 00:00:28,021
(I'm Ji Won's older brother, Kim Yun Jae.)

13
00:00:28,022 --> 00:00:30,761
(The thought that I could finally be with my sibling...)

14
00:00:30,762 --> 00:00:32,301
(made me feel good.)

15
00:00:32,302 --> 00:00:37,503
(And the siblings' stories were revealed.)

16
00:00:40,003 --> 00:00:42,712
As a working mom, it made me...

17
00:00:42,713 --> 00:00:43,941
feel at ease for no reason.

18
00:00:43,942 --> 00:00:47,841
(I think we grew up in similar ways.)

19
00:00:47,842 --> 00:00:52,582
(Rather than saying anything, I wanted to hug him.)

20
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:54,423
(Let's hug once.)

21
00:00:57,253 --> 00:00:59,562
(They're really like my family now.)

22
00:00:59,563 --> 00:01:02,762
(It felt good to be able to spend the moment with them.)

23
00:01:02,763 --> 00:01:04,901
(We seem to have gotten closer.)

24
00:01:04,902 --> 00:01:06,631
(A lot closer.)

25
00:01:06,632 --> 00:01:09,032
(In the warm atmosphere, a letter arrived.)

26
00:01:09,033 --> 00:01:12,041
(The five song cards in the letter)

27
00:01:12,042 --> 00:01:14,372
(The night before, their parents wrote...)

28
00:01:14,373 --> 00:01:16,672
(what songs they want to play to their children.)

29
00:01:16,673 --> 00:01:20,441
(The women choose the date for their siblings.)

30
00:01:20,442 --> 00:01:22,012
(The siblings' dates have been decided...)

31
00:01:22,013 --> 00:01:23,582
(based on the women's choices.)

32
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:26,722
(Jae Hyung's sister, Se Seung)

33
00:01:26,723 --> 00:01:29,922
(Yong Woo and Cho A were matched for a date.)

34
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:33,622
(Yong Woo's sister, Ju Yeon)

35
00:01:33,623 --> 00:01:36,991
(Yun Jae's first date that Ji Won chose)

36
00:01:36,992 --> 00:01:40,502
(Jung Sub's sister, Yun Ha)

37
00:01:40,503 --> 00:01:43,533
(Cheol Hyeon's date, Ji Won)

38
00:01:43,772 --> 00:01:45,571
- Shall we toast? - Sure.

39
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:47,741
(Another letter arrived.)

40
00:01:47,742 --> 00:01:49,672
(The final participant, Yun Jae,)

41
00:01:49,673 --> 00:01:52,342
(already chose his date.)

42
00:01:52,343 --> 00:01:55,952
(Call the name of the person that you chose here.)

43
00:01:55,953 --> 00:01:57,251
(I chose Yun Ha.)

44
00:01:57,252 --> 00:02:00,952
(The siblings' choices matched.)

45
00:02:00,953 --> 00:02:03,091
(Honestly, my heart fluttered a lot.)

46
00:02:03,092 --> 00:02:04,721
(Is this possible?)

47
00:02:04,722 --> 00:02:08,461
(Yun Jae and Yun Ha got to date twice.)

48
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:12,632
(They wrap up the trip in Gangwon Province.)

49
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,733
(Yun Ha, Yong Woo, and Cho A return.)

50
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:20,043
It's home.

51
00:02:20,302 --> 00:02:22,271
It's nice to be back.

52
00:02:22,272 --> 00:02:24,472
Yes, it feels like I'm home.

53
00:02:25,113 --> 00:02:26,142
They're back.

54
00:02:26,143 --> 00:02:27,543
(Jae Hyung, Ju Yeon, Se Seung, and Jung Sub return.)

55
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:30,513
What's up?

56
00:02:31,413 --> 00:02:33,423
Welcome back.

57
00:02:34,122 --> 00:02:36,622
- Nothing has changed. - A lot has changed.

58
00:02:36,953 --> 00:02:38,622
(Agreeing)

59
00:02:38,823 --> 00:02:41,393
(They now have Yun Jae's bed.)

60
00:02:42,592 --> 00:02:43,991
- Yong Woo. - Yes?

61
00:02:43,992 --> 00:02:46,562
Do you have the remover?

62
00:02:47,462 --> 00:02:50,072
- That's so natural. - I know, right?

63
00:02:50,073 --> 00:02:51,132
They're now...

64
00:02:51,133 --> 00:02:52,771
She just calls him casually now.

65
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:55,212
- Exactly. This is very strange. - "Yong Woo."

66
00:02:56,113 --> 00:02:58,042
It's natural now.

67
00:02:58,043 --> 00:03:00,512
This is so funny. It became like this in just a few hours.

68
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,613
- It's really a home. - Yes. I love it.

69
00:03:02,853 --> 00:03:04,383
They're acting naturally now.

70
00:03:05,682 --> 00:03:07,681
- Jae Hyung. - Yes?

71
00:03:07,682 --> 00:03:08,952
What about tomorrow?

72
00:03:08,953 --> 00:03:09,992
Right.

73
00:03:10,122 --> 00:03:11,991
(Help me do my laundry.)

74
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:13,922
(Her brother asks her help for his laundry.)

75
00:03:13,923 --> 00:03:16,393
I can, but why are you being secretive?

76
00:03:17,962 --> 00:03:19,062
(It's embarrassing.)

77
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,733
(What's wrong with you?)

78
00:03:23,372 --> 00:03:24,801
At once? Or split them?

79
00:03:24,802 --> 00:03:26,142
No, just do it at once.

80
00:03:26,143 --> 00:03:27,573
- Okay. - Thank you.

81
00:03:29,312 --> 00:03:32,312
(Cheol Hyeon, Ji Won, and Yun Jae return.)

82
00:03:33,282 --> 00:03:34,543
It took you so long to come back.

83
00:03:35,383 --> 00:03:36,552
When did you arrive?

84
00:03:36,613 --> 00:03:38,211
About an hour ago?

85
00:03:38,212 --> 00:03:41,082
I'll show you to our room. You're sleeping above me.

86
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:42,152
I see.

87
00:03:44,492 --> 00:03:47,392
- This is your bed. This was added. - This?

88
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,492
You can sleep here.

89
00:03:49,633 --> 00:03:51,662
(He helps Yun Jae carry his stuff too.)

90
00:03:51,663 --> 00:03:53,663
If I knew they weren't sleeping...

91
00:03:53,962 --> 00:03:55,203
What is this?

92
00:03:56,203 --> 00:03:57,233
There's raw fish.

93
00:03:57,633 --> 00:03:59,173
We wanted to have it with some liquor.

94
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:01,072
- Did you order this? - You brought this?

95
00:04:01,073 --> 00:04:02,341
- Really? - My sister and I did.

96
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:04,312
- Then go wash quickly. - Okay.

97
00:04:04,313 --> 00:04:05,481
Come down when you're ready.

98
00:04:05,482 --> 00:04:06,582
This can't be helped.

99
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:08,183
This can't be helped. I'll sleep late tonight.

100
00:04:09,513 --> 00:04:10,852
Shall I cook a pack of ramyeon?

101
00:04:11,053 --> 00:04:12,351
- Yes. - If there's something like that...

102
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:13,582
I'll cook it.

103
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:15,422
Wait, I was joking.

104
00:04:15,652 --> 00:04:17,453
I'll cook two packs of ramyeon.

105
00:04:17,493 --> 00:04:19,063
- Aren't you going to sleep? - Ramyeon?

106
00:04:19,493 --> 00:04:21,393
I can add this.

107
00:04:21,563 --> 00:04:22,592
That's a good idea.

108
00:04:23,133 --> 00:04:25,432
Normally, I add scallion oil too,

109
00:04:25,433 --> 00:04:27,532
but I want to make it simple now.

110
00:04:27,633 --> 00:04:30,072
What are you doing?

111
00:04:30,073 --> 00:04:31,572
Since he joined us, we should cook something for him.

112
00:04:31,573 --> 00:04:33,341
You must be tired. You don't have to.

113
00:04:33,342 --> 00:04:35,242
- I want to serve some side dishes. - Side dishes?

114
00:04:35,243 --> 00:04:36,872
- You don't have to. - Here you go.

115
00:04:36,873 --> 00:04:38,313
(She feels sorry about her sibling's appearance.)

116
00:04:39,143 --> 00:04:40,341
Do you want to sleep here?

117
00:04:40,342 --> 00:04:41,442
(Se Seung, Ju Yeon, and Ji Won's room)

118
00:04:41,443 --> 00:04:42,852
Cho A passed out.

119
00:04:43,912 --> 00:04:46,622
Yun Ha, since it's all revealed now, I have something to show off.

120
00:04:46,623 --> 00:04:47,722
What is it?

121
00:04:47,982 --> 00:04:50,823
(She shows her the picture she took with Jung Sub.)

122
00:04:52,393 --> 00:04:53,422
How is it?

123
00:04:54,022 --> 00:04:55,092
What's that?

124
00:05:01,933 --> 00:05:04,432
- Welcome. - Thank you.

125
00:05:04,433 --> 00:05:06,672
- You worked hard. - Welcome.

126
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,911
You're so thoughtful with this.

127
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:13,443
She placed the order.

128
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,813
- I paid for it too. - It's so good.

129
00:05:16,212 --> 00:05:17,382
- It's really delicious. - She tried to use mine,

130
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:18,553
but it didn't go through.

131
00:05:19,022 --> 00:05:21,382
I tried to pay with his card, but I couldn't.

132
00:05:21,383 --> 00:05:23,053
So I was annoyed.

133
00:05:26,222 --> 00:05:27,362
My brother.

134
00:05:28,993 --> 00:05:30,133
It's so good.

135
00:05:30,362 --> 00:05:33,002
(He plates it up straight away.)

136
00:05:33,003 --> 00:05:35,433
(He sprinkles some sesame too.)

137
00:05:36,232 --> 00:05:38,841
- It's good that you came. - I cooked something simple.

138
00:05:38,842 --> 00:05:40,601
- Thank you. - Just a bit for each.

139
00:05:40,602 --> 00:05:42,541
Just have a taste.

140
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:44,341
- You even sprinkled sesame. - Even sesame seeds.

141
00:05:44,342 --> 00:05:47,143
- Thank you for the food. - It's just something in between.

142
00:05:47,743 --> 00:05:50,312
- You're not eating this? - No, I gave it to her first.

143
00:05:50,313 --> 00:05:52,521
You can't give it to her because that's yours.

144
00:05:52,522 --> 00:05:54,722
- The colour. - The noodles are harder.

145
00:05:54,823 --> 00:05:56,021
- I took yours out first. - They're different?

146
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,322
- It's custom-made. - This is...

147
00:05:57,323 --> 00:06:00,422
- I took yours out first. - He put in his thoughts for you.

148
00:06:00,922 --> 00:06:03,862
Something to watch out for. They have a very intense bromance.

149
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,031
- These two? - Yes.

150
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:09,003
It might be hard for you in the room.

151
00:06:09,272 --> 00:06:10,832
What if they get close...

152
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:14,502
but one of them does something bad to his sister later?

153
00:06:14,503 --> 00:06:16,813
Bromance? Forget about it.

154
00:06:16,912 --> 00:06:18,171
- It's useless. - It might be even more dangerous.

155
00:06:18,172 --> 00:06:20,012
That's what I mean.

156
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:21,111
It'll become UFC straight away.

157
00:06:21,112 --> 00:06:22,481
Things might get complicated.

158
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:23,552
That's true.

159
00:06:23,553 --> 00:06:25,683
I want something like that to happen.

160
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:27,453
You're more evil than you look.

161
00:06:30,092 --> 00:06:31,862
- You guys are a bad influence. - This...

162
00:06:31,962 --> 00:06:33,623
I didn't take you for someone like that.

163
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:35,731
She's on fire without BamBam.

164
00:06:35,732 --> 00:06:38,393
(BamBam could not join the shooting due to a world tour.)

165
00:06:38,703 --> 00:06:40,662
- Without BamBam... - How are you doing, BamBam?

166
00:06:40,703 --> 00:06:41,872
- I miss you. - I miss you.

167
00:06:41,873 --> 00:06:43,602
- Come back quickly. - Come back quickly.

168
00:06:44,133 --> 00:06:46,142
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you.

169
00:06:46,143 --> 00:06:47,942
- Thank you. - Welcome.

170
00:06:47,943 --> 00:06:49,942
- Welcome. - Welcome.

171
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:51,042
(The atmosphere of the welcome party heats up.)

172
00:06:51,772 --> 00:06:53,342
The raw fish is incredible.

173
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:55,782
(Slurping)

174
00:06:56,513 --> 00:06:58,252
(Slurping)

175
00:06:58,253 --> 00:07:00,753
(The sound of slurping noodles echoes at dawn.)

176
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:03,021
I made it salty since it's night.

177
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:04,693
You must eat salty food at night.

178
00:07:05,152 --> 00:07:06,461
Your face needs to get puffy in the morning...

179
00:07:06,462 --> 00:07:07,763
- That's right. - to look cute.

180
00:07:09,092 --> 00:07:11,433
I like Seoul because a lot of places offer delivery at this hour too.

181
00:07:13,402 --> 00:07:15,833
- That's right. - There's none in Chuncheon.

182
00:07:16,073 --> 00:07:18,472
- Then your home is... - In Chuncheon, yes.

183
00:07:18,873 --> 00:07:20,942
- I was nervous. - I understand.

184
00:07:20,943 --> 00:07:22,742
I didn't know what you were doing.

185
00:07:22,743 --> 00:07:25,642
I sneaked a peek to find her,

186
00:07:25,643 --> 00:07:29,053
and everyone was suddenly wiping their eyes with tissues.

187
00:07:29,612 --> 00:07:31,953
"Can I really go out right now?"

188
00:07:34,823 --> 00:07:37,253
Anyway, I went down funnily.

189
00:07:37,393 --> 00:07:38,921
- But... - No, you came down coolly.

190
00:07:38,922 --> 00:07:40,192
- No. - You looked cool.

191
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:41,892
- You looked cool. - You looked awkward...

192
00:07:41,893 --> 00:07:43,562
when you came down.

193
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:45,062
"What's wrong with him?"

194
00:07:45,063 --> 00:07:47,563
You looked down like this from above.

195
00:07:48,263 --> 00:07:50,601
It would've been fine if our video was fun,

196
00:07:50,602 --> 00:07:53,202
- but it was sad at that moment. - Exactly.

197
00:07:53,203 --> 00:07:55,512
I was going to enjoy watching it,

198
00:07:55,513 --> 00:07:58,172
but I suddenly started crying too.

199
00:07:59,042 --> 00:08:01,013
Yong Woo's eyes were...

200
00:08:01,342 --> 00:08:03,183
His eyes were like a sea.

201
00:08:04,152 --> 00:08:06,753
- His eyes were wet. - I cried a lot today.

202
00:08:07,222 --> 00:08:10,652
I had some expectations about what the siblings would talk about,

203
00:08:10,792 --> 00:08:12,062
but when they said...

204
00:08:12,063 --> 00:08:13,692
- something unexpected, - That's right.

205
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:15,792
- That's right. - it made me feel sad.

206
00:08:16,133 --> 00:08:17,291
This is why a curve ball is dangerous.

207
00:08:17,292 --> 00:08:18,462
You're right.

208
00:08:18,732 --> 00:08:22,273
What did you feel when I chose Yun Ha?

209
00:08:23,033 --> 00:08:25,772
I chose without hesitation.

210
00:08:25,773 --> 00:08:28,642
- Really? - I made up my mind...

211
00:08:28,972 --> 00:08:30,241
as soon as I saw it.

212
00:08:30,242 --> 00:08:32,611
- I... - Why? How did you know?

213
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:35,882
Yun Ha looked very clever,

214
00:08:36,212 --> 00:08:39,552
confident, bright, and independent.

215
00:08:39,553 --> 00:08:40,721
- That's right. - I had the feeling.

216
00:08:40,722 --> 00:08:42,322
My sister's very independent.

217
00:08:42,323 --> 00:08:43,992
I thought they would click.

218
00:08:45,193 --> 00:08:46,961
In a situation like that,

219
00:08:46,962 --> 00:08:50,732
Jung Sub saw her complimenting and liking his sibling sincerely.

220
00:08:50,962 --> 00:08:53,062
She likes Yun Ha.

221
00:08:53,063 --> 00:08:54,731
Could Jung Sub feel something...

222
00:08:54,732 --> 00:08:56,631
- Gosh. I don't think so. - for Ji Won?

223
00:08:56,632 --> 00:08:57,632
You don't think so?

224
00:08:57,633 --> 00:08:59,903
- He just feels good and grateful. - Yes, just...

225
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:01,902
You'll feel grateful, but...

226
00:09:01,903 --> 00:09:03,312
But I think it could open the gate.

227
00:09:03,313 --> 00:09:04,313
Definitely.

228
00:09:04,314 --> 00:09:06,981
- Really? - If he sees her in a new light...

229
00:09:06,982 --> 00:09:08,043
because of that,

230
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:11,752
it could open the gate to his feelings.

231
00:09:12,423 --> 00:09:13,852
That can happen?

232
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:17,751
Confident, bright, and independent.

233
00:09:17,752 --> 00:09:19,091
- That's right. - I had the feeling.

234
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:20,621
- My sister's very independent. - Your sister...

235
00:09:20,622 --> 00:09:21,992
I thought they would suit each other well.

236
00:09:22,132 --> 00:09:25,502
He becomes very obedient when he meets someone like that.

237
00:09:26,403 --> 00:09:28,332
- He treats them well. - Really?

238
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:29,471
He's that kind of person.

239
00:09:29,472 --> 00:09:30,731
I'll go to bed first.

240
00:09:30,732 --> 00:09:32,273
- You must be tired. - You have work tomorrow.

241
00:09:33,602 --> 00:09:35,342
- See you again. - See you.

242
00:09:35,413 --> 00:09:38,111
You get to go on a date...

243
00:09:38,112 --> 00:09:39,841
with Yun Ha twice in a row.

244
00:09:39,842 --> 00:09:41,042
- You're right. - Exactly.

245
00:09:41,043 --> 00:09:44,111
- I was genuinely shocked. - It's so fascinating.

246
00:09:44,112 --> 00:09:45,452
Me too, seriously.

247
00:09:45,453 --> 00:09:47,221
- Did you really not know? - Not at all.

248
00:09:47,222 --> 00:09:48,891
if I knew,

249
00:09:48,892 --> 00:09:50,822
- I could've chosen someone else. - Rather... That's right.

250
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:53,522
I chose without knowing anything, but we chose the same person.

251
00:09:53,523 --> 00:09:54,761
It's fascinating.

252
00:09:54,762 --> 00:09:56,961
You guys definitely have an eye for the same type of people.

253
00:09:56,962 --> 00:09:59,802
There must be one for siblings.

254
00:09:59,803 --> 00:10:01,961
I was quite surprised when you picked her.

255
00:10:01,962 --> 00:10:03,902
Right? I hope you meet a nice person.

256
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,472
- She... - My sister is a really nice person.

257
00:10:06,573 --> 00:10:08,602
- I think so too. - Treat her well when you meet her.

258
00:10:09,972 --> 00:10:11,672
You can do this now.

259
00:10:11,673 --> 00:10:14,512
His eyes turned red just now.

260
00:10:14,642 --> 00:10:16,011
"Treat her well." Like this.

261
00:10:16,012 --> 00:10:18,782
In the video, you played the piano very well too.

262
00:10:18,783 --> 00:10:19,822
Piano?

263
00:10:19,823 --> 00:10:21,922
- You were really good at it. - There's a piano downstairs.

264
00:10:21,923 --> 00:10:23,952
Play a duet with my sister.

265
00:10:23,953 --> 00:10:26,292
- We should. - That sounds nice.

266
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:29,832
She sometimes plays with a pianist for concertos and stuff.

267
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:33,131
Just now, Yun Ha told me that my hands looked sturdy.

268
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,702
- Sturdy? - Sturdy.

269
00:10:34,703 --> 00:10:36,732
My sister must've fallen in love with you.

270
00:10:37,502 --> 00:10:39,342
- Because I even play the piano? - Because you even play the piano.

271
00:10:40,543 --> 00:10:41,602
What to do?

272
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:43,642
I got in her good books, but you...

273
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:45,712
Treat her well.

274
00:10:47,783 --> 00:10:50,812
Jung Sub, I think a clarinet suits you.

275
00:10:50,813 --> 00:10:52,121
- A clarinet? - Yes.

276
00:10:52,122 --> 00:10:53,481
- Like this. - Like this?

277
00:10:53,482 --> 00:10:55,083
- A bassoon. - A bassoon?

278
00:10:55,693 --> 00:10:56,792
(Imitating bassoon sound)

279
00:10:56,793 --> 00:10:58,961
A trumpet for Yong Woo.

280
00:10:58,962 --> 00:11:00,422
- A trumpet? - A trumpet.

281
00:11:00,423 --> 00:11:01,562
(Laughing)

282
00:11:01,563 --> 00:11:03,333
- A guitar. - A guitar?

283
00:11:03,862 --> 00:11:05,461
- A guitar... - A guitar's for Jae Hyung.

284
00:11:05,462 --> 00:11:07,562
I heard that Jae Hyung was a very good singer.

285
00:11:07,563 --> 00:11:08,932
I haven't heard him sing yet.

286
00:11:08,933 --> 00:11:10,001
Someone told me that.

287
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,202
It seems that there are a lot of good singers here.

288
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:12,741
Jae Hyung's good.

289
00:11:12,742 --> 00:11:14,542
I don't think there would be an occasion for you to sing.

290
00:11:14,543 --> 00:11:15,772
Jung Sub is good too.

291
00:11:15,773 --> 00:11:19,443
(Two days later)

292
00:11:25,683 --> 00:11:27,622
But home definitely feels comfortable.

293
00:11:28,352 --> 00:11:29,523
Is this your home already?

294
00:11:29,953 --> 00:11:31,352
Yes, it feels like home.

295
00:11:32,762 --> 00:11:35,323
This will feel like my real home for the time being.

296
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,163
Jung Sub.

297
00:11:37,793 --> 00:11:39,502
- We can go downstairs. - Can we?

298
00:11:39,762 --> 00:11:41,961
Then shall we go downstairs and drink?

299
00:11:41,962 --> 00:11:43,202
I've never been there,

300
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:44,432
- so I want to go. - Then let's go.

301
00:11:44,433 --> 00:11:46,543
It's really nice downstairs. You must go there.

302
00:11:47,403 --> 00:11:48,742
I'll bring these.

303
00:11:49,443 --> 00:11:50,542
Check.

304
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:53,183
(They continue drinking in the hideout downstairs.)

305
00:11:54,882 --> 00:11:55,982
This is so nice.

306
00:11:56,553 --> 00:11:57,652
This is insane.

307
00:11:57,653 --> 00:12:00,423
There are a lot of drinks.

308
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:01,722
Gosh.

309
00:12:01,982 --> 00:12:03,023
There's alcohol too.

310
00:12:04,122 --> 00:12:05,622
There's a piano here too.

311
00:12:15,632 --> 00:12:16,833
You're cool.

312
00:12:17,602 --> 00:12:20,002
My sister will go crazy.

313
00:12:21,303 --> 00:12:23,172
I was going to film it.

314
00:12:23,173 --> 00:12:24,472
That's why I stopped.

315
00:12:25,842 --> 00:12:28,443
Actually, I wanted him and Cheol Hyeon...

316
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:31,582
- to have a conversation today, - I see.

317
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:34,351
I'm grateful to everyone for joining us.

318
00:12:34,352 --> 00:12:36,251
Of course we should.

319
00:12:36,252 --> 00:12:37,822
- Right. - Cheers.

320
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:38,962
Cheers.

321
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:41,891
You know...

322
00:12:41,892 --> 00:12:45,333
- that people focusing on me... - Being in the spotlight.

323
00:12:45,362 --> 00:12:46,402
- It makes you feel uncomfortable? - It makes me feel uncomfortable.

324
00:12:46,403 --> 00:12:49,303
It's beyond feeling uncomfortable. I feel very anxious, actually.

325
00:12:49,433 --> 00:12:52,072
- If I wasn't sitting beside her, - It would've been really hard.

326
00:12:52,073 --> 00:12:53,842
I would've screwed up really bad.

327
00:12:55,712 --> 00:12:59,313
Doesn't he look better now than the makeup he applied today?

328
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:00,881
You look way more natural.

329
00:13:00,882 --> 00:13:03,053
- I was like, "Who are you?" - I think he looks the same.

330
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:06,023
- His hair was like this too. - Right.

331
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:07,923
(A few hours ago)

332
00:13:08,122 --> 00:13:09,792
Why are your eyes smaller than usual?

333
00:13:09,793 --> 00:13:10,952
They're always small.

334
00:13:10,953 --> 00:13:13,122
I don't think they were this small.

335
00:13:13,462 --> 00:13:14,823
Why are they so small today?

336
00:13:15,063 --> 00:13:16,792
Your hair's so curly.

337
00:13:16,793 --> 00:13:18,392
You don't like it at all, do you?

338
00:13:18,663 --> 00:13:20,731
I don't know, it became curly. I don't like it either.

339
00:13:20,732 --> 00:13:22,632
- It's way too curly. - Exactly.

340
00:13:23,232 --> 00:13:25,672
I was itching...

341
00:13:25,673 --> 00:13:27,272
to tell Yun Ha...

342
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:30,543
that he was better than that, but I held myself back.

343
00:13:31,012 --> 00:13:32,482
"He looks strange now."

344
00:13:33,283 --> 00:13:34,912
I'm curious about that.

345
00:13:34,913 --> 00:13:36,112
Your ideal type.

346
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:39,982
Yun Ha's younger brother asked you.

347
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,892
Seriously though, why did you choose my sister?

348
00:13:44,693 --> 00:13:46,563
- Why... Seriously? - Yes, seriously.

349
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,622
But seriously...

350
00:13:48,892 --> 00:13:50,391
I can tell you with certainty.

351
00:13:50,392 --> 00:13:51,892
She was the only one I could see.

352
00:13:52,862 --> 00:13:54,903
There's no other reason. She was the only one I could see.

353
00:13:55,203 --> 00:13:56,472
- Really? - Yes.

354
00:13:56,803 --> 00:13:57,803
(Amazed)

355
00:13:58,033 --> 00:14:00,741
- He likes someone who smiles a lot. - That's nice.

356
00:14:00,742 --> 00:14:03,212
But I chose your sister...

357
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:05,011
- The first impression. - because I could only see her.

358
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:07,783
- That's the end. Nothing more. - That's so cool.

359
00:14:08,342 --> 00:14:10,111
Anyway, when you came in,

360
00:14:10,112 --> 00:14:12,012
I had to choose for sure.

361
00:14:12,252 --> 00:14:14,422
I never made a choice this fast before.

362
00:14:14,423 --> 00:14:16,251
How many times would I have experienced...

363
00:14:16,252 --> 00:14:18,092
making a quick choice like this?

364
00:14:18,222 --> 00:14:19,862
- That's so true. - I could just see her.

365
00:14:21,122 --> 00:14:22,663
(I'll put some meat on your plate.)

366
00:14:25,193 --> 00:14:26,562
I never did something like this to the person...

367
00:14:26,563 --> 00:14:27,933
that I met for the first time.

368
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:30,332
But this time...

369
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:31,732
It's hard to choose too.

370
00:14:31,903 --> 00:14:32,903
But...

371
00:14:33,173 --> 00:14:35,072
I think I made the right choice.

372
00:14:35,073 --> 00:14:36,573
(Surprised)

373
00:14:37,512 --> 00:14:39,413
Thank you so much. I'm so grateful.

374
00:14:39,842 --> 00:14:41,943
Let us two toast on our own.

375
00:14:42,783 --> 00:14:44,083
Let us toast then.

376
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:46,422
I was really curious too.

377
00:14:46,423 --> 00:14:48,851
- "Who would he choose?" - Whom would he choose?

378
00:14:48,852 --> 00:14:50,822
With a precious daughter...

379
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:52,792
Yes, a precious daughter of another family.

380
00:14:52,793 --> 00:14:54,221
- and a shabby son... - "A precious daughter..."

381
00:14:54,222 --> 00:14:55,622
- of my family. - "of another family."

382
00:14:56,132 --> 00:14:59,703
I think your ideal type is very simple.

383
00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:01,962
I'm trying to keep it that way for now...

384
00:15:02,303 --> 00:15:04,332
because nothing comes out from overthinking.

385
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:07,543
So I'll just trust what I can see and go intuitively.

386
00:15:07,742 --> 00:15:10,612
I really hope it works out.

387
00:15:10,813 --> 00:15:12,142
I'm not pressuring you.

388
00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:14,683
- It's not the end. - Yun Ha might loathe him.

389
00:15:15,183 --> 00:15:17,611
That's possible, yes.

390
00:15:17,612 --> 00:15:19,923
"Jung Sub. He..." Like this.

391
00:15:20,222 --> 00:15:22,121
My sister likes someone...

392
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:24,022
who's serious but humorous.

393
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:25,523
He's quite...

394
00:15:26,462 --> 00:15:27,622
I think you'll get along well.

395
00:15:28,323 --> 00:15:30,562
This is what I want to know now.

396
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:31,961
Are they older, younger, or the same age?

397
00:15:31,962 --> 00:15:33,361
- His exes? - His exes.

398
00:15:33,362 --> 00:15:36,832
- Your exes. - Mine were mostly older.

399
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:37,971
- Older. - Older.

400
00:15:37,972 --> 00:15:39,202
Weren't yours younger?

401
00:15:39,203 --> 00:15:41,172
Either the same age or younger.

402
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:42,742
Just 1 or 2 years difference, whether younger or older.

403
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:44,942
It's a bit hard beyond that.

404
00:15:44,943 --> 00:15:46,782
Two years older or younger?

405
00:15:46,783 --> 00:15:48,241
I don't want too big of an age gap.

406
00:15:48,242 --> 00:15:49,712
Really?

407
00:15:50,313 --> 00:15:52,012
That thought hasn't changed even now.

408
00:15:55,953 --> 00:15:58,722
You have a pretty narrow range.

409
00:15:59,023 --> 00:16:01,491
- That's my comfortable range. - Since you're here now,

410
00:16:01,492 --> 00:16:03,462
- you'll have to break that. - Break it?

411
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:07,062
- That's just my preference. - I see. Okay.

412
00:16:07,063 --> 00:16:10,072
- I think Yun Ha's in that range. - Really?

413
00:16:10,073 --> 00:16:11,231
I think they're the same age.

414
00:16:11,232 --> 00:16:14,501
This is so fun. I know how old my sister is.

415
00:16:14,502 --> 00:16:16,142
- That's right. - I think they're the same age.

416
00:16:17,813 --> 00:16:19,543
The same age or...

417
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:21,641
Can I just ask this?

418
00:16:21,642 --> 00:16:24,112
Do you have someone you have feelings for?

419
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:25,882
Of course I have.

420
00:16:26,222 --> 00:16:28,381
- I have. - Really?

421
00:16:28,382 --> 00:16:29,992
There are someone you have feelings for?

422
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:32,091
- Because they came in first. - But... Exactly.

423
00:16:32,092 --> 00:16:34,861
But I'm not the type to fall in love at first sight.

424
00:16:34,862 --> 00:16:37,631
Rather, it started with "He's not my type at all..."

425
00:16:37,632 --> 00:16:39,361
then I fell for them.

426
00:16:39,362 --> 00:16:42,361
Then the first impression...

427
00:16:42,362 --> 00:16:45,032
- It's not important. - might not be important.

428
00:16:45,033 --> 00:16:48,972
But we talked a lot, more or less.

429
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:52,783
I just need to talk with Jae Hyung.

430
00:16:52,912 --> 00:16:54,841
I really want to know more about Jae Hyung.

431
00:16:54,842 --> 00:16:57,181
It's 8am now.

432
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,482
- Really? - Seriously?

433
00:16:58,483 --> 00:17:00,722
(The sun rose already.)

434
00:17:00,723 --> 00:17:02,253
- Amazing. - I didn't know time had passed.

435
00:17:02,692 --> 00:17:04,052
How is it already 8am?

436
00:17:04,053 --> 00:17:06,563
(It's 8am.)

437
00:17:13,503 --> 00:17:15,763
I know what it is. Because I also...

438
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:19,473
(He hears sound from the basement hideout.)

439
00:17:20,842 --> 00:17:22,442
I want to know about it.

440
00:17:22,872 --> 00:17:23,973
Who is it?

441
00:17:25,642 --> 00:17:27,312
- You're going to work. - You're going to work.

442
00:17:27,313 --> 00:17:29,181
You're going to work?

443
00:17:29,182 --> 00:17:31,052
- You stayed up all night? - We stayed up all night.

444
00:17:31,053 --> 00:17:32,583
This is the first time for us too.

445
00:17:32,723 --> 00:17:35,182
- You crazy people. - "You crazy people."

446
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:38,993
- Have a seat. - No, I need to go.

447
00:17:39,622 --> 00:17:41,192
What are you going to do today?

448
00:17:41,392 --> 00:17:43,062
- I'm going to sleep today. - We're all going to sleep today.

449
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:45,462
- We should sleep. - Good luck.

450
00:17:45,463 --> 00:17:47,063
- See you later. - I like his perfume.

451
00:17:47,303 --> 00:17:48,333
Cheers.

452
00:17:50,033 --> 00:17:51,601
If I remember correctly,

453
00:17:51,602 --> 00:17:54,341
Jae Hyung came in when we were drinking.

454
00:17:54,342 --> 00:17:56,742
It felt like he came soon.

455
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:58,911
"We ate raw fish together just now. He came back quickly."

456
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:01,382
It didn't feel at all like a long time had passed for me.

457
00:18:01,783 --> 00:18:04,312
I wanted to talk with Ji Won,

458
00:18:04,313 --> 00:18:05,983
and since Ji Won was there,

459
00:18:06,053 --> 00:18:07,682
it was very exciting.

460
00:18:09,723 --> 00:18:11,323
- I told you. - Really?

461
00:18:11,592 --> 00:18:13,563
- I was right. - Because of his sister?

462
00:18:13,823 --> 00:18:14,921
From the piano?

463
00:18:14,922 --> 00:18:16,333
His sister and the piano.

464
00:18:16,932 --> 00:18:18,131
- Really? - Am I wrong again?

465
00:18:18,132 --> 00:18:21,702
This is the power of alcohol, guys.

466
00:18:21,803 --> 00:18:24,802
- You really can't beat alcohol. - You can't overlook it.

467
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:26,773
What exactly happens when you drink?

468
00:18:26,942 --> 00:18:28,171
I think people who normally don't...

469
00:18:28,172 --> 00:18:29,671
fall in love quickly.

470
00:18:29,672 --> 00:18:31,611
It numbs your rational side.

471
00:18:31,612 --> 00:18:33,242
Then is it over once you get sober?

472
00:18:33,243 --> 00:18:35,641
Getting sober isn't a reset button.

473
00:18:35,642 --> 00:18:38,111
I did see quite a few cases where it ended once they got sober.

474
00:18:38,112 --> 00:18:40,022
- Really? - They sleep, wake up, and...

475
00:18:40,023 --> 00:18:41,983
Do they regret it? Do they think it's a mistake?

476
00:18:42,152 --> 00:18:45,192
How will that drinking session go?

477
00:18:45,493 --> 00:18:46,723
It's so fun.

478
00:18:47,422 --> 00:18:48,622
It's fun, right?

479
00:18:49,592 --> 00:18:53,362
(At 8:30am, Jae Hyung goes to work.)

480
00:18:55,102 --> 00:18:59,072
To be honest, I thought you would choose Cheol Hyeon...

481
00:18:59,073 --> 00:19:00,202
on the day you moved in.

482
00:19:00,342 --> 00:19:01,573
- I see. - You did? Why?

483
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:03,672
You guys talked the longest.

484
00:19:03,773 --> 00:19:05,513
We had to wait for him to come back for a long time.

485
00:19:06,283 --> 00:19:09,553
But it was simple. I just talked to her a lot.

486
00:19:10,412 --> 00:19:11,982
- He asked me so many questions. - I doubt that's why.

487
00:19:11,983 --> 00:19:12,983
Right.

488
00:19:12,984 --> 00:19:14,882
But I chose Yong Woo...

489
00:19:15,223 --> 00:19:17,552
because he seemed the most relaxed out of everyone.

490
00:19:17,553 --> 00:19:20,192
The three of you seemed flustered.

491
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:23,562
Only Yong Woo sat down like this. He was...

492
00:19:23,563 --> 00:19:24,563
He was lying down.

493
00:19:24,564 --> 00:19:27,463
He leaned back. And he crossed his legs too.

494
00:19:27,662 --> 00:19:30,371
(You look like you could be my senior right now.)

495
00:19:30,372 --> 00:19:31,372
(Are you ready?)

496
00:19:32,132 --> 00:19:34,202
(Did you prepare a self-introduction and a special talent?)

497
00:19:35,473 --> 00:19:36,641
He acted like my senior.

498
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:38,642
"This will happen once you move into the house."

499
00:19:38,912 --> 00:19:40,042
The second reason was...

500
00:19:40,043 --> 00:19:43,053
I had the most romantic interest in him back then.

501
00:19:43,412 --> 00:19:46,323
- That's how I felt back then. - I see.

502
00:19:46,523 --> 00:19:48,882
Then I went on a date with Yong Woo...

503
00:19:49,253 --> 00:19:51,023
the next day right away.

504
00:19:51,253 --> 00:19:52,793
But on the date, it already felt like...

505
00:19:53,323 --> 00:19:55,392
we were like good friends.

506
00:19:57,132 --> 00:19:58,962
So I went on a date with the guy...

507
00:19:58,963 --> 00:20:00,832
I thought I had the most romantic interest in,

508
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,901
but I ended up seeing him as a friend.

509
00:20:02,902 --> 00:20:05,802
By the way, she's good at leaving things open.

510
00:20:05,803 --> 00:20:08,102
What? Leave what opens?

511
00:20:11,213 --> 00:20:12,743
What do you mean by that?

512
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:15,411
So I went on a date with the guy...

513
00:20:15,412 --> 00:20:16,881
I thought I had the most romantic interest in,

514
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,851
but I ended up seeing him as a friend.

515
00:20:18,852 --> 00:20:21,752
By the way, she's good at leaving things open.

516
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:24,053
What? Leave what opens?

517
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:28,692
What do you mean by that?

518
00:20:29,632 --> 00:20:31,691
You're leaving all the possibilities open.

519
00:20:31,692 --> 00:20:34,701
But it's the same with the guys.

520
00:20:34,702 --> 00:20:36,032
Of course, there are other possibilities...

521
00:20:36,033 --> 00:20:37,671
It's not like I chose Yong Woo...

522
00:20:37,672 --> 00:20:40,043
because I like him a lot or anything.

523
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:41,802
Nonetheless, when you first met us,

524
00:20:41,803 --> 00:20:45,013
the guy you chose was Yong Woo.

525
00:20:45,243 --> 00:20:47,181
But the person you talked to the most...

526
00:20:47,182 --> 00:20:48,542
was Cheol Hyeon.

527
00:20:48,543 --> 00:20:50,313
I just assumed that the people...

528
00:20:50,513 --> 00:20:52,952
you were interested in were Cheol Hyeon and Yong Woo.

529
00:20:53,053 --> 00:20:54,053
- I... - But...

530
00:20:54,054 --> 00:20:56,752
you just told us that Yong Woo was more like friend material to you.

531
00:20:56,753 --> 00:20:59,052
Is that why you said I left my options open?

532
00:20:59,053 --> 00:21:00,322
- That's why. - I see.

533
00:21:00,323 --> 00:21:01,323
- But... - But...

534
00:21:01,622 --> 00:21:02,692
I can't watch this.

535
00:21:03,793 --> 00:21:05,832
- What's going on right now? - Something is going wrong.

536
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:07,032
So it's time for them to sleep.

537
00:21:07,033 --> 00:21:08,062
Right.

538
00:21:08,063 --> 00:21:10,073
- It's well-past their bedtime. - Right.

539
00:21:10,172 --> 00:21:11,232
If they talk a little longer,

540
00:21:11,233 --> 00:21:12,702
they might end up attacking each other.

541
00:21:12,973 --> 00:21:14,171
- It would've been great... - Only I'm doing this.

542
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:15,902
- if they ended before that. - Seriously.

543
00:21:16,073 --> 00:21:17,313
What's going on right now?

544
00:21:17,842 --> 00:21:20,313
You gave Yong Woo a chance to have a date with you.

545
00:21:20,642 --> 00:21:23,253
- But this is what you say to us. - But...

546
00:21:23,553 --> 00:21:24,813
- It feels like... - What about that?

547
00:21:24,912 --> 00:21:26,151
- I'm watching... - So I'm here.

548
00:21:26,152 --> 00:21:27,253
- a morning soap opera in person. - I...

549
00:21:28,652 --> 00:21:29,921
All right. Let's do it here.

550
00:21:29,922 --> 00:21:32,052
I chose not because I like him a lot or anything.

551
00:21:32,053 --> 00:21:33,691
I chose Cheol Hyeon not because I like him a lot or anything.

552
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:35,192
- Right. - Right.

553
00:21:35,323 --> 00:21:37,392
I shared the reason I chose Yong Woo for my date.

554
00:21:37,533 --> 00:21:41,063
I said I was the most comfortable with Yong Woo. To Jung Sub,

555
00:21:41,463 --> 00:21:45,432
it felt like I was leaving my options open with other guys.

556
00:21:46,342 --> 00:21:47,941
Let me make this clear.

557
00:21:47,942 --> 00:21:50,773
Yong Woo is the type of guy I want to like.

558
00:21:51,172 --> 00:21:53,012
(Surprised)

559
00:21:53,013 --> 00:21:54,013
I...

560
00:21:54,014 --> 00:21:55,712
- That's a strong move. - Gosh. You're straightforward.

561
00:21:55,713 --> 00:21:57,082
I want to like him.

562
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:59,052
I had always been the giver...

563
00:21:59,053 --> 00:22:01,351
- in my romantic relationships. - That's how you showed love.

564
00:22:01,352 --> 00:22:02,352
But now,

565
00:22:02,353 --> 00:22:03,753
- I want to be taken care of too. - That's what you want.

566
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,852
That's what I think.

567
00:22:06,053 --> 00:22:08,292
But instinctively, I'm attracted...

568
00:22:08,293 --> 00:22:09,532
- a certain type of man. - That too.

569
00:22:09,533 --> 00:22:10,962
- I want to take care of... - Listen.

570
00:22:10,963 --> 00:22:12,901
This explanation of how you are in a relationship...

571
00:22:12,902 --> 00:22:15,832
and the things you said about Yong Woo...

572
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:18,472
- are the polar opposites. - Right.

573
00:22:18,473 --> 00:22:21,371
Jung Sub is a smart guy.

574
00:22:21,372 --> 00:22:23,841
I think he's a very rational person.

575
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:28,013
But when it comes to women, he's quite innocent.

576
00:22:28,182 --> 00:22:29,512
It made me think...

577
00:22:29,513 --> 00:22:30,851
if he didn't think people's feelings could be in a Gray zone.

578
00:22:30,852 --> 00:22:32,282
I wondered...

579
00:22:32,283 --> 00:22:35,783
if he thought people's feelings were either black or white.

580
00:22:35,983 --> 00:22:38,851
But just because I chose Yong Woo...

581
00:22:38,852 --> 00:22:40,962
- Right. So you chose... - But it was too short of a time...

582
00:22:40,963 --> 00:22:43,062
- Yong Woo... - to pick someone based on...

583
00:22:43,063 --> 00:22:44,063
- romantic feelings. - Right.

584
00:22:44,064 --> 00:22:45,762
- That's right. - You were simply curious.

585
00:22:45,763 --> 00:22:47,901
It was similar to how we went on dinner dates.

586
00:22:47,902 --> 00:22:49,062
You just simply got a meal with him.

587
00:22:49,063 --> 00:22:51,102
- It's like grabbing a meal. - It was comfortable with him.

588
00:22:51,432 --> 00:22:52,701
Is that confusing?

589
00:22:52,702 --> 00:22:53,942
(Glancing)

590
00:22:54,243 --> 00:22:55,472
(Glancing)

591
00:22:55,473 --> 00:22:57,111
What is it that you want to know?

592
00:22:57,112 --> 00:22:58,112
- Lee Jung Sub. - So...

593
00:22:58,112 --> 00:22:59,112
(Forcing out his laughter)

594
00:22:59,113 --> 00:23:00,382
Give it to me straight.

595
00:23:00,942 --> 00:23:03,982
It looked like there was a conflict.

596
00:23:03,983 --> 00:23:05,151
There was a clash of opinions.

597
00:23:05,152 --> 00:23:08,052
But I think it might have been the case because we were drinking.

598
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,793
I don't think anyone was at fault.

599
00:23:10,892 --> 00:23:12,053
I was just flustered.

600
00:23:15,023 --> 00:23:16,662
Was there a fight when you were drinking?

601
00:23:19,392 --> 00:23:20,402
A fight?

602
00:23:22,233 --> 00:23:23,402
No, there wasn't.

603
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:25,833
(He remembers the drinking session differently.)

604
00:23:26,132 --> 00:23:28,803
I don't remember there being an argument.

605
00:23:29,102 --> 00:23:32,142
No. I think you're curious about something.

606
00:23:32,342 --> 00:23:33,812
I think the conversation is just going in circles.

607
00:23:33,813 --> 00:23:35,942
- Right. - There can't be a clear answer.

608
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:38,312
Let's end it. We can play Never Have I Ever or something.

609
00:23:38,313 --> 00:23:40,182
Let's do something to reset the mood.

610
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:42,053
- There's no solution here. - Right.

611
00:23:42,892 --> 00:23:45,452
I think you guys have different styles.

612
00:23:45,922 --> 00:23:47,191
- Seriously. For example... - Right.

613
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:49,022
- Right. - Your styles are different.

614
00:23:49,023 --> 00:23:50,361
You guys have different styles.

615
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:51,392
Here's an example.

616
00:23:51,533 --> 00:23:53,132
Anyway...

617
00:23:53,362 --> 00:23:54,861
- No one is getting up. - Let's go to sleep, guys.

618
00:23:54,862 --> 00:23:55,902
All right. Let's go to sleep, guys.

619
00:23:56,273 --> 00:23:57,572
They don't want to go to sleep.

620
00:23:57,573 --> 00:23:59,671
- Great. - Yes. What...

621
00:23:59,672 --> 00:24:00,773
(No one seems to want to get up.)

622
00:24:01,003 --> 00:24:02,572
I got up and said we should go to sleep.

623
00:24:02,573 --> 00:24:03,573
I thought Jung Sub was going to come up,

624
00:24:03,573 --> 00:24:04,573
but he stayed down there.

625
00:24:04,574 --> 00:24:05,743
So I pretended I didn't see that and came up.

626
00:24:05,942 --> 00:24:09,213
(Cheol Hyeon and Yun Jae got up first.)

627
00:24:10,112 --> 00:24:12,013
How was your day today?

628
00:24:12,412 --> 00:24:13,522
Did you have a good time?

629
00:24:13,523 --> 00:24:15,553
I was having a mental breakdown yesterday.

630
00:24:16,422 --> 00:24:17,921
I mustered up my courage...

631
00:24:17,922 --> 00:24:19,422
and expressed my interest in someone.

632
00:24:21,223 --> 00:24:22,323
But it didn't go well.

633
00:24:23,932 --> 00:24:25,563
(Responding)

634
00:24:26,533 --> 00:24:28,833
(Yun Jae comes down at that moment.)

635
00:24:30,573 --> 00:24:31,802
What did you two talk about?

636
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:32,942
(He's curious about their private conversation.)

637
00:24:33,172 --> 00:24:35,372
Gosh. Aren't you tired?

638
00:24:40,882 --> 00:24:42,043
What did you talk about?

639
00:24:42,983 --> 00:24:45,482
I never had a chance to talk to Ji Won.

640
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:47,553
She and I have similar personalities...

641
00:24:49,823 --> 00:24:51,022
- What are you doing? - Hey, go and get changed.

642
00:24:51,023 --> 00:24:52,652
You look so dull. It's annoying.

643
00:24:55,063 --> 00:24:56,563
You guys are like real siblings.

644
00:24:56,963 --> 00:24:57,992
Are you drunk?

645
00:24:57,993 --> 00:24:59,702
How dare you criticize my outfit?

646
00:25:00,202 --> 00:25:02,602
- Should I leave you two alone? - No.

647
00:25:03,073 --> 00:25:05,472
No. I shouldn't. You guys might end up fighting.

648
00:25:05,473 --> 00:25:07,172
How dare you criticize my outfit?

649
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:09,672
What do you want to do when you go on a date?

650
00:25:10,273 --> 00:25:12,142
Do you like trying out activities?

651
00:25:12,642 --> 00:25:14,013
I like trying out activities.

652
00:25:14,342 --> 00:25:16,752
I was kind of a nerd. I only studied in school.

653
00:25:16,753 --> 00:25:19,612
A nerd? Are you a pouting nerd?

654
00:25:20,553 --> 00:25:21,722
Why do you get sulky?

655
00:25:21,723 --> 00:25:23,691
Or I thought about craft classes too.

656
00:25:23,692 --> 00:25:25,223
- Craft classes? - Instead of craft classes...

657
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:27,362
- Do you like sports? - Yes.

658
00:25:27,662 --> 00:25:29,522
Do you want to go bowling?

659
00:25:29,523 --> 00:25:31,533
- Bowling? That sounds good too. - Yes.

660
00:25:33,432 --> 00:25:35,631
- They're planning a date now. - It's time for them...

661
00:25:35,632 --> 00:25:37,302
- This is scary. - They were just arguing.

662
00:25:37,303 --> 00:25:38,401
I mean, it wasn't a big argument.

663
00:25:38,402 --> 00:25:39,941
If Yun Jae wasn't there,

664
00:25:39,942 --> 00:25:42,172
- there would've been a spark. - Really?

665
00:25:42,342 --> 00:25:43,973
They could have had a spark?

666
00:25:44,112 --> 00:25:46,072
There would have been a spark of some kind.

667
00:25:46,073 --> 00:25:47,182
- There would've been a spark? - Yes.

668
00:25:47,442 --> 00:25:49,982
Without Yun Jae, they would've talked about something deep.

669
00:25:49,983 --> 00:25:51,052
- Right. - Here's why.

670
00:25:51,053 --> 00:25:53,282
They're openly talking about what they like...

671
00:25:53,283 --> 00:25:54,921
- and what they don't like. - Right.

672
00:25:54,922 --> 00:25:57,023
- Really? - I see.

673
00:25:57,523 --> 00:25:59,391
Do you want to go bowling?

674
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:01,392
- Bowling? That sounds good too. - Yes.

675
00:26:04,233 --> 00:26:05,563
What are you two doing?

676
00:26:06,763 --> 00:26:08,401
I don't know. But...

677
00:26:08,402 --> 00:26:09,661
- we might not get a chance... - Right.

678
00:26:09,662 --> 00:26:10,902
- to go on a date. - First of all,

679
00:26:11,132 --> 00:26:13,072
- I... - Or we should go on a double date.

680
00:26:13,073 --> 00:26:14,942
That actually sounds good.

681
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:19,043
Yun Ha might never want to go on a date with you.

682
00:26:20,142 --> 00:26:21,142
Is that so?

683
00:26:21,143 --> 00:26:23,053
- I'll take care of that. - Then...

684
00:26:23,213 --> 00:26:24,412
I need to deal with that.

685
00:26:24,713 --> 00:26:26,422
- You two can do whatever you want. - We can go for a drive.

686
00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:28,922
I'll go to sleep.

687
00:26:36,223 --> 00:26:37,591
I don't know how I did it.

688
00:26:37,592 --> 00:26:39,592
I still can't do it because my fingers are short.

689
00:26:46,503 --> 00:26:47,743
You can play that?

690
00:26:49,473 --> 00:26:52,313
I don't know how I played it when I was a kid.

691
00:27:02,823 --> 00:27:04,522
(Surprised)

692
00:27:04,523 --> 00:27:05,622
Not bad.

693
00:27:09,122 --> 00:27:10,392
(Messing up)

694
00:27:15,362 --> 00:27:16,362
C...

695
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,243
That was really hot.

696
00:27:26,882 --> 00:27:28,082
(Shocked)

697
00:27:28,083 --> 00:27:30,013
- What was that just now? - What? Hold on!

698
00:27:30,783 --> 00:27:31,783
What did he say?

699
00:27:31,784 --> 00:27:33,452
- Seriously. - I didn't see that coming at all!

700
00:27:33,922 --> 00:27:34,951
I...

701
00:27:34,952 --> 00:27:37,152
- I... - I'm completely lost now!

702
00:27:38,352 --> 00:27:39,722
- Hot? - "That was really hot."

703
00:27:39,723 --> 00:27:40,823
He said it was really hot.

704
00:27:42,622 --> 00:27:44,162
That was really hot.

705
00:27:45,862 --> 00:27:48,503
What? Weren't you looking for that note?

706
00:27:52,202 --> 00:27:54,502
- What were you trying to do? - How did you know that?

707
00:27:54,503 --> 00:27:56,773
You were stuck there.

708
00:27:57,043 --> 00:27:58,942
Weren't you looking for this note?

709
00:28:04,912 --> 00:28:06,753
- Are you done? - Yes, I'm done.

710
00:28:07,223 --> 00:28:10,323
When it was just the two of us, we played the piano together.

711
00:28:10,592 --> 00:28:12,352
That made my heart flutter.

712
00:28:12,692 --> 00:28:14,523
I don't know why I felt that way.

713
00:28:14,862 --> 00:28:17,033
I was drunk and a bit dazed.

714
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:19,332
When she played the piano next to me,

715
00:28:19,333 --> 00:28:20,702
that made my heart flutter then.

716
00:28:21,362 --> 00:28:23,772
I was able to get to know her better because we talked...

717
00:28:23,773 --> 00:28:25,172
in a comfortable setting.

718
00:28:25,402 --> 00:28:26,872
Get some sleep, Ji Won.

719
00:28:27,043 --> 00:28:28,102
Okay.

720
00:28:28,172 --> 00:28:30,141
But the sun already came up?

721
00:28:30,142 --> 00:28:32,313
The sun already came up high like this.

722
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:40,583
- Oh, no! - Until 10am.

723
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:42,523
That was legendary.

724
00:28:43,852 --> 00:28:44,852
This is so entertaining.

(Episode 8: Siblings' Dilemma)

737
00:30:08,402 --> 00:30:10,412
(The same day, 12pm)

738
00:30:17,783 --> 00:30:19,553
Why is she sleeping without removing her makeup?

739
00:30:26,553 --> 00:30:29,092
(Yong Woo is about to go out to exercise.)

740
00:31:05,463 --> 00:31:07,563
(He jogs to the park without taking a break.)

741
00:31:41,602 --> 00:31:42,602
- The upside down thing? - What?

742
00:31:42,603 --> 00:31:43,872
Why...

743
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:46,332
Wait. That's a hard machine to use.

744
00:31:46,333 --> 00:31:47,641
- Why? - That's a popular machine.

745
00:31:47,642 --> 00:31:49,543
When people get on that, they never get off like a bat.

746
00:31:50,213 --> 00:31:51,842
- A bat? - I'm serious.

747
00:31:51,973 --> 00:31:54,182
I wanted to use that machine too, but I rarely got a chance.

748
00:31:54,583 --> 00:31:56,141
- You had to wait. - Right. That's a popular machine.

749
00:31:56,142 --> 00:31:58,352
- It's popular. - Many senior citizens live there.

750
00:31:58,983 --> 00:32:00,422
They don't get off once they go upside down.

751
00:32:01,053 --> 00:32:02,452
- That's so funny. - That's hilarious.

752
00:32:02,952 --> 00:32:04,023
This is too much.

753
00:32:04,253 --> 00:32:06,622
(The man who took over the upside-down machine)

754
00:32:21,872 --> 00:32:22,872

756
00:33:06,753 --> 00:33:07,753
Good afternoon.

00:33:08,053 --> 00:33:09,783
(Groaning)

758
00:33:10,323 --> 00:33:11,592
Until when did you guys drink last night?

759
00:33:12,723 --> 00:33:14,622
- Until 8am. - Gosh. Really?

760
00:33:15,622 --> 00:33:17,162
Jung Sub stayed up longer than me.

761
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:19,391
Really? He stayed up longer?

762
00:33:19,392 --> 00:33:22,462
Jung Sub and my sister stayed up later than me.

763
00:33:22,463 --> 00:33:23,573
They stayed up later than you.

764
00:33:24,132 --> 00:33:25,372
They're no joke.

765
00:33:25,672 --> 00:33:27,743
I didn't know Ji Won could drink that much.

766
00:33:28,202 --> 00:33:30,073
- She can outdrink me. - Really?

767
00:33:30,672 --> 00:33:32,243
She can probably drink four bottles of soju if she wants.

768
00:33:34,342 --> 00:33:35,912
I should go to the convenience store.

769
00:33:37,483 --> 00:33:39,513
(Yun Jae comes back from a convenience store.)

770
00:33:41,422 --> 00:33:42,622
(Grabbing)

771
00:33:45,192 --> 00:33:46,553
(Gently opening)

772
00:33:49,263 --> 00:33:51,092
(He bought hangover cures.)

773
00:33:58,572 --> 00:33:59,702
(Stopping)

774
00:34:00,102 --> 00:34:01,572
I shouldn't go in without permission.

775
00:34:05,273 --> 00:34:06,273
(Stopping)

776
00:34:07,782 --> 00:34:09,482
(Hesitant)

777
00:34:09,483 --> 00:34:10,483
About here?

778
00:34:11,153 --> 00:34:12,153
I don't know.

779
00:34:12,613 --> 00:34:14,622
(He leaves the hangover cure for her sister and walks away.)

780
00:34:17,052 --> 00:34:18,892
(He wakes up by drinking the hangover cure.)

781
00:34:21,423 --> 00:34:23,162
- Oh, no. - Until when did you drink?

782
00:34:23,833 --> 00:34:25,531
- What? - Until when did you drink?

783
00:34:25,532 --> 00:34:26,962
Is it 4pm now?

784
00:34:26,963 --> 00:34:29,101
I'm not sure if this is the right time.

785
00:34:29,102 --> 00:34:30,532
- It's 4pm now. - It's the right time.

786
00:34:33,133 --> 00:34:35,242
It's about time we started our day.

787
00:34:36,173 --> 00:34:37,773
This is when our day begins.

788
00:34:38,872 --> 00:34:40,412
(It's night.)

789
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:43,713
(Ji Won gets up at 5pm.)

790
00:34:49,782 --> 00:34:51,392
- Are you going on a date? - Yes.

791
00:34:53,492 --> 00:34:55,023
I woke up, but it's dark.

792
00:34:56,662 --> 00:34:57,662
It's nice.

793
00:34:59,532 --> 00:35:00,963
You didn't do anything during the day.

794
00:35:02,032 --> 00:35:03,161
What will you wear?

795
00:35:03,162 --> 00:35:04,502
Do a good job. Seriously.

796
00:35:04,503 --> 00:35:06,972
I'll wear that with this and then the shirt.

797
00:35:07,503 --> 00:35:08,543
And the pants.

798
00:35:09,443 --> 00:35:10,713
Is this round shirt okay?

799
00:35:11,072 --> 00:35:12,273
I'll wear the shirt over this.

800
00:35:12,943 --> 00:35:14,113
- You'll wear the shirt over that? - Yes.

801
00:35:14,583 --> 00:35:15,641
Well...

802
00:35:15,642 --> 00:35:16,983
That's a bright colour.

803
00:35:17,452 --> 00:35:20,252
It's your first date. Shouldn't you look more serious?

804
00:35:20,253 --> 00:35:21,423
Is it just what I like?

805
00:35:22,083 --> 00:35:23,452
Show me your dark-coloured clothes.

806
00:35:23,722 --> 00:35:25,491
The slacks and the black knitted sweater.

807
00:35:25,492 --> 00:35:27,063
It's the same outfit I wore to go to see you.

808
00:35:27,722 --> 00:35:29,192
Wouldn't it be better to wear a dark outfit...

809
00:35:29,193 --> 00:35:31,193
on your 1st date and wear a bright outfit on your 2nd date?

810
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:32,662
Yes, sir.

811
00:35:33,432 --> 00:35:34,532
You're right!

812
00:35:36,363 --> 00:35:37,733
How did Yong Woo dress?

813
00:35:38,932 --> 00:35:40,673
Right. He wore a dark-coloured outfit.

814
00:35:42,102 --> 00:35:43,503
So you don't have any plans today?

815
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:45,172
You'll just stay puffy like that?

816
00:35:45,173 --> 00:35:46,173
Yes.

817
00:35:46,512 --> 00:35:48,182
Try to get rid of the puffiness. It looks awful.

818
00:35:48,983 --> 00:35:50,012
I do look puffy.

819
00:35:53,923 --> 00:35:55,653
You saw that I barely ate anything yesterday.

820
00:35:56,852 --> 00:35:57,852
Hey,

821
00:35:58,153 --> 00:35:59,892
- make sure to brush your teeth. - Okay.

822
00:36:00,662 --> 00:36:01,991
If your breath stinks,

823
00:36:01,992 --> 00:36:04,362
use the tongue cleaner thoroughly.

824
00:36:04,363 --> 00:36:05,363
Okay.

825
00:36:05,532 --> 00:36:08,362
Seriously. Having a bad breath is the worst.

826
00:36:08,363 --> 00:36:09,363
Okay.

827
00:36:10,133 --> 00:36:11,832
Are you sure you shaved?

828
00:36:11,833 --> 00:36:14,071
- It's still kind of prickly. - I can't seem to get a clean shave.

829
00:36:14,072 --> 00:36:15,602
- Don't touch that. - Okay.

830
00:36:15,773 --> 00:36:17,741
Don't touch your face with your fingers.

831
00:36:17,742 --> 00:36:18,742
Okay.

832
00:36:21,282 --> 00:36:22,613
Try to open your eyes wide.

833
00:36:22,843 --> 00:36:24,411
This is the widest I can open them.

834
00:36:24,412 --> 00:36:25,851
(He feels wronged.)

835
00:36:25,852 --> 00:36:27,253
"Try to open your eyes wide."

836
00:36:27,483 --> 00:36:28,983
They are so cute.

837
00:36:29,083 --> 00:36:30,451
Gosh. She's doing everything for him.

838
00:36:30,452 --> 00:36:32,992
Yun Jae does look like her younger brother, not older.

839
00:36:33,423 --> 00:36:35,192
Don't curl your hair too much.

840
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,761
- Okay. - You're done.

841
00:36:36,762 --> 00:36:38,293
Who knew you would actually be helpful in my life?

842
00:36:39,432 --> 00:36:40,932
Why don't you try to help me then?

843
00:36:41,063 --> 00:36:42,262
That will never happen.

844
00:36:42,662 --> 00:36:46,071
Gosh, you went upstairs without me yesterday.

845
00:36:46,072 --> 00:36:47,673
I had to. Otherwise, I would've died.

846
00:36:48,202 --> 00:36:49,302
You're a funny guy.

847
00:36:50,872 --> 00:36:52,742
(He takes his toothbrush.)

848
00:36:56,083 --> 00:36:59,352
(He thoroughly brushes his teeth once again.)

849
00:37:00,213 --> 00:37:02,351
(Se Seung, Ju Yeon, and Ji Won's room)

850
00:37:02,352 --> 00:37:04,221
What's Jae Hyung's type?

851
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,321
He's the only one I know nothing about.

852
00:37:06,322 --> 00:37:07,563
Jae Hyung...

853
00:37:08,293 --> 00:37:10,292
He doesn't fall for someone quickly.

854
00:37:10,293 --> 00:37:11,592
- I see. - But...

855
00:37:11,593 --> 00:37:14,463
I think he has to feel relaxed to get to know someone.

856
00:37:14,662 --> 00:37:15,932
- He has to feel relaxed? - Yes.

857
00:37:16,202 --> 00:37:19,572
I can tell that he seems very uncomfortable around me.

858
00:37:19,802 --> 00:37:21,503
- He seems uncomfortable? - Yes.

859
00:37:21,903 --> 00:37:24,613
It would be nice if you guys get a chance to talk.

860
00:37:24,972 --> 00:37:26,972
What do you think he's like?

861
00:37:27,242 --> 00:37:29,342
He's the most unexpected one here.

862
00:37:29,343 --> 00:37:30,451
Is that so?

863
00:37:30,452 --> 00:37:33,083
I would like to take care of him in some ways.

864
00:37:33,253 --> 00:37:36,051
At the same time, I might be able to rely on him for some things.

865
00:37:36,052 --> 00:37:37,492
That's the vibe I get from him.

866
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:39,992
Isn't he the most beloved one in the house?

867
00:37:40,762 --> 00:37:42,492
- He's the most beloved one? - Yes.

868
00:37:42,693 --> 00:37:46,463
I do like men who act cute and are sweet.

869
00:37:46,733 --> 00:37:47,733
I see.

870
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:52,133
I don't like men who act indifferent when deep down, they care for you...

871
00:37:52,372 --> 00:37:54,471
because my brother is like that.

872
00:37:54,472 --> 00:37:56,602
- He acts indifferent. - I hate seeing that.

873
00:37:57,173 --> 00:37:58,342
- But... - I like...

874
00:37:58,343 --> 00:37:59,871
men who are openly sweet to me.

875
00:37:59,872 --> 00:38:01,181
You're just like me.

876
00:38:01,182 --> 00:38:02,342
- Really? - Yes.

877
00:38:02,343 --> 00:38:03,951
My brother looks cold but takes good care of me.

878
00:38:03,952 --> 00:38:05,653
Yes. I know!

879
00:38:05,753 --> 00:38:08,653
That's the impression I got of Jae Hyung,

880
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:11,293
but I kept watching him, and it wasn't necessarily true.

881
00:38:11,452 --> 00:38:13,652
I guess he's different when he treats others.

882
00:38:13,653 --> 00:38:17,192
Yes. He can be really sweet to others.

883
00:38:17,193 --> 00:38:19,232
- Right. - He isn't like that with everyone,

884
00:38:19,233 --> 00:38:21,762
which makes him more charming.

885
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:25,371
My brother and I are just typical siblings.

886
00:38:25,372 --> 00:38:27,141
Us too.

887
00:38:27,142 --> 00:38:28,701
You two seemed to care for each other quite a bit.

888
00:38:28,702 --> 00:38:30,872
I don't care for him that much. I just want to throw up.

889
00:38:31,613 --> 00:38:32,673
For real.

890
00:38:33,813 --> 00:38:35,142
That's insane.

891
00:38:35,883 --> 00:38:38,182
Even just now when I was putting makeup on him.

892
00:38:38,512 --> 00:38:39,682
(Sighing)

893
00:38:41,552 --> 00:38:44,552
Still, you're so sweet to him.

894
00:38:45,352 --> 00:38:47,721
Well, I have to take good care of him.

895
00:38:47,722 --> 00:38:48,793
(Breathing out deeply)

896
00:38:49,793 --> 00:38:53,633
(He's antsy as he's nervous about the date.)

897
00:38:55,403 --> 00:38:57,932
(He tries reading.)

898
00:39:01,202 --> 00:39:02,202
(I can't.)

899
00:39:02,372 --> 00:39:04,072
(He can't read.)

900
00:39:04,673 --> 00:39:06,773
(He suddenly remembers his sister's advice.)

901
00:39:07,043 --> 00:39:08,983
Wash your tongue clean with a tongue cleaner.

902
00:39:12,012 --> 00:39:14,952
(Checking his breath)

903
00:39:15,523 --> 00:39:17,451
- He's checking his breath. - That's the best way.

904
00:39:17,452 --> 00:39:19,252
You can check quickly.

905
00:39:19,253 --> 00:39:20,991
That's a little adorable.

906
00:39:20,992 --> 00:39:22,292
- He's cute. - Yes.

907
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:24,232
Is your favourite Yun Jae now, not Jae Hyung anymore?

908
00:39:24,233 --> 00:39:25,531
- No. - It's not that?

909
00:39:25,532 --> 00:39:27,092
- He's single-hearted. - I don't change my mind easily.

910
00:39:27,093 --> 00:39:28,102
I see.

911
00:39:28,403 --> 00:39:30,602
(Checking his breath)

912
00:39:32,432 --> 00:39:34,773
(After checking himself, he takes off for his date.)

913
00:39:35,003 --> 00:39:36,842
I'll be back. See you.

914
00:39:36,843 --> 00:39:38,673
- See you. - Bye.

915
00:39:38,813 --> 00:39:40,142
This is hard.

916
00:39:41,213 --> 00:39:42,213
Oh, dear.

917
00:39:48,483 --> 00:39:52,322
(Leaving the house confidently)

918
00:39:54,923 --> 00:39:56,792
Look her in the eye when you talk to her.

919
00:39:56,793 --> 00:40:00,531
Don't get flustered and scratch your face.

920
00:40:00,532 --> 00:40:02,202
Don't speak too fast.

921
00:40:03,903 --> 00:40:05,403
(Sighing)

922
00:40:06,102 --> 00:40:07,471
I was born in Chuncheon...

923
00:40:07,472 --> 00:40:09,371
and went to high school in China.

924
00:40:09,372 --> 00:40:10,871
And I went to college in Canada.

925
00:40:10,872 --> 00:40:13,442
When I came back to Korea, I went to live in Chuncheon again.

926
00:40:13,443 --> 00:40:16,181
So I don't really know...

927
00:40:16,182 --> 00:40:17,752
good places for dates in Seoul.

928
00:40:17,753 --> 00:40:20,181
I've heard of a few places,

929
00:40:20,182 --> 00:40:21,422
but when I choose a place,

930
00:40:21,423 --> 00:40:25,093
I should know what to do there in detail, but I don't.

931
00:40:25,892 --> 00:40:27,363
(He sighs again.)

932
00:40:30,963 --> 00:40:32,162
Oh, my.

933
00:40:32,492 --> 00:40:34,202
My mouth feels so dry. Oh, dear.

934
00:40:35,333 --> 00:40:38,633
I'm in trouble. My mouth feels too dry.

935
00:40:38,833 --> 00:40:41,071
I was totally nervous...

936
00:40:41,072 --> 00:40:43,003
even on my way in the car.

937
00:40:43,102 --> 00:40:44,342
(Sighing)

938
00:40:44,343 --> 00:40:46,943
What should I do? Oh, please.

939
00:40:51,813 --> 00:40:53,313
(Yun Jae sighs.)

940
00:41:04,463 --> 00:41:06,833
(He saw Yun Ha.)

941
00:41:15,372 --> 00:41:16,972
- Hello. - Hello.

942
00:41:20,943 --> 00:41:22,212
- Thanks... - Well...

943
00:41:22,213 --> 00:41:23,281
for picking me up.

944
00:41:23,282 --> 00:41:24,351
You should be relaxing after work,

945
00:41:24,352 --> 00:41:25,883
but you have to see an unfamiliar face.

946
00:41:26,213 --> 00:41:27,282
Oh, my.

947
00:41:28,253 --> 00:41:30,382
It's been 30 years...

948
00:41:30,383 --> 00:41:33,321
I mean, it's been three years since I rode in a car with a woman.

949
00:41:33,322 --> 00:41:34,322
- Thirty years? - Thirty years?

950
00:41:34,323 --> 00:41:35,661
That surprised me.

951
00:41:35,662 --> 00:41:36,761
If it's been three years,

952
00:41:36,762 --> 00:41:39,161
- Three years... - it hasn't been that long.

953
00:41:39,162 --> 00:41:40,902
- Thirty years. - It's actually been thirty years,

954
00:41:40,903 --> 00:41:42,562
- I think so. - but he just made it shorter.

955
00:41:42,563 --> 00:41:43,862
He made it shorter to three years?

956
00:41:43,863 --> 00:41:45,733
Wouldn't that be such a big difference?

957
00:41:46,032 --> 00:41:47,602
Three years and thirty years are completely different.

958
00:41:49,602 --> 00:41:51,173
"What should I talk about?"

959
00:41:51,512 --> 00:41:53,342
"There shouldn't be a pause in the conversation."

960
00:41:53,343 --> 00:41:55,483
I kept having these thoughts in the car.

961
00:41:55,682 --> 00:41:58,681
It's been around three years since I had a meal...

962
00:41:58,682 --> 00:41:59,911
or did things with a woman.

963
00:41:59,912 --> 00:42:02,222
- Really? - That's why I'm nervous.

964
00:42:02,822 --> 00:42:04,321
You've been busy.

965
00:42:04,322 --> 00:42:06,023
Yes, I have.

966
00:42:06,392 --> 00:42:08,293
I'm nervous, so please understand.

967
00:42:09,222 --> 00:42:11,192
- I'm nervous too. - Really?

968
00:42:11,193 --> 00:42:14,062
He said he felt awkward...

969
00:42:14,063 --> 00:42:16,562
because it'd been a long time since he last dated.

970
00:42:16,563 --> 00:42:20,232
He told me what was going on honestly,

971
00:42:20,233 --> 00:42:22,843
which was impressive.

972
00:42:23,503 --> 00:42:24,642
Wait.

973
00:42:25,773 --> 00:42:27,912
- Okay. - Goodness.

974
00:42:28,043 --> 00:42:30,382
- It'd be better to pull over there. - Okay.

975
00:42:30,383 --> 00:42:32,852
- It's near the entrance here. - Yes. I'm thrown off.

976
00:42:33,282 --> 00:42:34,322
This is not good.

977
00:42:35,852 --> 00:42:36,883
It's okay.

978
00:42:36,983 --> 00:42:39,452
I had to look at the GPS on the way,

979
00:42:39,923 --> 00:42:41,891
but I was too anxious to do so.

980
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:43,222
I got tunnel vision.

981
00:42:44,063 --> 00:42:45,891
I don't remember anything...

982
00:42:45,892 --> 00:42:48,333
from the moment I grabbed the wheel.

983
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:50,332
We must be going to a nice place, then.

984
00:42:50,333 --> 00:42:52,332
Yes. Oh, dear.

985
00:42:52,333 --> 00:42:54,472
It's because I've never been to this place.

986
00:42:55,242 --> 00:42:57,272
Since you're a cellist,

987
00:42:57,273 --> 00:42:58,571
what do you usually do for work?

988
00:42:58,572 --> 00:43:01,982
I play as a guest cellist...

989
00:43:01,983 --> 00:43:04,781
or the principal cellist in an orchestra.

990
00:43:04,782 --> 00:43:06,812
I give lessons to students too.

991
00:43:06,813 --> 00:43:07,952
- Students? - Yes.

992
00:43:08,423 --> 00:43:11,192
- You said you returned to Korea. - Yes.

993
00:43:11,193 --> 00:43:12,851
Where were you before, then?

994
00:43:12,852 --> 00:43:15,062
I stayed in a few places.

995
00:43:15,063 --> 00:43:16,721
I once stayed in China.

996
00:43:16,722 --> 00:43:17,863
We stayed in China too.

997
00:43:18,063 --> 00:43:19,262
- Really? - For about three years...

998
00:43:19,593 --> 00:43:20,593
in high school.

999
00:43:20,762 --> 00:43:22,862
You must speak fluent Chinese.

1000
00:43:22,863 --> 00:43:24,971
- Not as fluently as English. - Right.

1001
00:43:24,972 --> 00:43:26,471
You should've spoken Chinese right away.

1002
00:43:26,472 --> 00:43:28,042
Just say one Chinese word!

1003
00:43:28,043 --> 00:43:29,043
Yun Jae!

1004
00:43:29,044 --> 00:43:31,843
- It's been a while since I spoke. - You must be good at English.

1005
00:43:32,043 --> 00:43:33,842
Has it been a while since you came to Korea from Canada?

1006
00:43:33,843 --> 00:43:35,382
I came back when the pandemic started.

1007
00:43:35,383 --> 00:43:37,882
- It hasn't been that long. - Right. For about three years.

1008
00:43:37,883 --> 00:43:39,252
I thought I'd go back,

1009
00:43:39,253 --> 00:43:41,022
so I left everything there.

1010
00:43:41,023 --> 00:43:42,051
I didn't even sort out housing.

1011
00:43:42,052 --> 00:43:43,722
You're in a similar situation as I was.

1012
00:43:43,822 --> 00:43:46,621
She said she worked in China.

1013
00:43:46,622 --> 00:43:49,793
I thought it was good that we had something to talk about.

1014
00:43:50,122 --> 00:43:53,833
(Yun Ha and Yun Jae at a wine bar in Seongsu)

1015
00:43:54,032 --> 00:43:56,162
- It's so pretty. - It is.

1016
00:43:58,102 --> 00:43:59,932
What kind of alcohol do you usually enjoy?

1017
00:44:01,102 --> 00:44:02,871
I enjoy all kinds of alcohol.

1018
00:44:02,872 --> 00:44:04,472
- Do you like wine? - Yes.

1019
00:44:04,613 --> 00:44:08,112
It was so quiet and looked fancy,

1020
00:44:08,113 --> 00:44:09,212
so I was a little worried...

1021
00:44:09,213 --> 00:44:11,613
if I could speak in a way that suits the mood.

1022
00:44:21,222 --> 00:44:22,293
(Thud)

1023
00:44:22,693 --> 00:44:24,392
(Moving her chair)

1024
00:44:24,593 --> 00:44:27,261
It's too far.

1025
00:44:27,262 --> 00:44:28,262
(She gets closer.)

1026
00:44:28,802 --> 00:44:31,272
I was too far away.

1027
00:44:31,273 --> 00:44:34,842
Well, do you know how I chose you?

1028
00:44:34,843 --> 00:44:36,943
- No. I was curious, though. - You don't, right?

1029
00:44:37,043 --> 00:44:38,613
They told me to serve meat to the person I liked...

1030
00:44:39,043 --> 00:44:42,112
when you all came to the restaurant.

1031
00:44:42,113 --> 00:44:43,242
No one noticed, though.

1032
00:44:43,483 --> 00:44:44,682
I see!

1033
00:44:45,253 --> 00:44:46,753
(Two days ago, at Yun Jae's restaurant)

1034
00:44:48,023 --> 00:44:51,693
(He expressed his interest with beef brisket secretly.)

1035
00:44:52,992 --> 00:44:54,522
She looked pretty when she smiled.

1036
00:44:54,523 --> 00:44:55,821
I first chose her...

1037
00:44:55,822 --> 00:44:58,233
because of that smile too.

1038
00:44:58,463 --> 00:45:00,532
When we were on a date, I realized she was indeed pretty.

1039
00:45:01,733 --> 00:45:02,963
I thought, "Does she know?"

1040
00:45:04,673 --> 00:45:06,471
Ji Won chose you,

1041
00:45:06,472 --> 00:45:08,173
so I thought, "My sister knows me well."

1042
00:45:09,102 --> 00:45:11,571
You must've been happy when you saw her.

1043
00:45:11,572 --> 00:45:13,842
There aren't many times in life...

1044
00:45:13,843 --> 00:45:15,543
- where I'm happy to see her. - That's true.

1045
00:45:15,742 --> 00:45:17,042
Here you are.

1046
00:45:17,043 --> 00:45:18,383
- Thank you. - Enjoy.

1047
00:45:19,412 --> 00:45:20,483
It looks so pretty.

1048
00:45:22,352 --> 00:45:23,422
Let me give you some.

1049
00:45:23,423 --> 00:45:25,992
(Trembling)

1050
00:45:26,952 --> 00:45:27,963
Why is your hand shaking?

1051
00:45:28,722 --> 00:45:29,722
I'm nervous.

1052
00:45:29,723 --> 00:45:30,862
I like that.

1053
00:45:30,863 --> 00:45:32,332
That he's honest about being nervous?

1054
00:45:32,333 --> 00:45:33,531
- He tells her he's nervous. - Yes.

1055
00:45:33,532 --> 00:45:35,301
When she asks him about it, he answers honestly.

1056
00:45:35,302 --> 00:45:36,332
If he said,

1057
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:37,902
"No, I'm not nervous..."

1058
00:45:37,903 --> 00:45:39,772
- Even though his hands are shaky. - His hands might shake so much...

1059
00:45:39,773 --> 00:45:41,402
- "I'm not anxious." - that the pasta flies away.

1060
00:45:41,403 --> 00:45:43,202
- I know. - "I'm not nervous."

1061
00:45:43,343 --> 00:45:45,043
The clams might look like they're alive.

1062
00:45:46,742 --> 00:45:47,781
Yun Jae is nervous...

1063
00:45:47,782 --> 00:45:49,781
because he hasn't been on a date in three years,

1064
00:45:49,782 --> 00:45:52,851
- but it's also because... - He's into her,

1065
00:45:52,852 --> 00:45:54,352
- so he's nervous. - he likes Yun Ha a lot.

1066
00:45:54,682 --> 00:45:55,682
Let me give you some.

1067
00:45:55,683 --> 00:45:58,193
(Trembling)

1068
00:45:59,153 --> 00:46:00,193
Why is your hand shaking?

1069
00:46:00,923 --> 00:46:01,963
I'm nervous.

1070
00:46:02,193 --> 00:46:03,593
Don't focus on my hands.

1071
00:46:03,892 --> 00:46:04,931
They will be shaking...

1072
00:46:04,932 --> 00:46:06,332
- until I relax. - I won't look.

1073
00:46:06,333 --> 00:46:08,463
- I'll look away. - You don't have to do that.

1074
00:46:09,503 --> 00:46:10,903
Just don't pay attention to my hands too much.

1075
00:46:11,572 --> 00:46:13,072
His hands were shaky.

1076
00:46:13,572 --> 00:46:16,102
I wanted to help him relax quickly.

1077
00:46:18,012 --> 00:46:19,241
Shall we take a sip?

1078
00:46:19,242 --> 00:46:21,042
Oh, my. I'm nervous.

1079
00:46:21,043 --> 00:46:22,883
We need to drink some alcohol.

1080
00:46:23,043 --> 00:46:24,483
You can take your time.

1081
00:46:29,923 --> 00:46:30,992
It's good.

1082
00:46:31,952 --> 00:46:34,662
I kept thinking about what to do.

1083
00:46:35,363 --> 00:46:36,392
You're cute.

1084
00:46:38,992 --> 00:46:40,962
Well, this is...

1085
00:46:40,963 --> 00:46:42,932
- a date. - Yes.

1086
00:46:43,162 --> 00:46:44,801
- It's a nerve-wracking thing. - Right.

1087
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:46,101
(Being on a date is nerve-wracking.)

1088
00:46:46,102 --> 00:46:47,602
I kept thinking, "What do I do?"

1089
00:46:49,372 --> 00:46:50,403
It looks tasty.

1090
00:47:01,952 --> 00:47:02,983
It's delicious.

1091
00:47:04,222 --> 00:47:06,422
I watched some videos online before coming here...

1092
00:47:06,423 --> 00:47:07,552
to see what to talk about.

1093
00:47:08,293 --> 00:47:09,792
All the videos had the same tips.

1094
00:47:09,793 --> 00:47:11,862
- What did they say? - I don't think they're helpful.

1095
00:47:11,863 --> 00:47:13,332
"Listen carefully to the other person."

1096
00:47:13,333 --> 00:47:14,503
Of course, I'll listen to you.

1097
00:47:17,602 --> 00:47:19,532
"Don't cut them off."

1098
00:47:20,302 --> 00:47:22,702
- I'm in trouble. - It's okay.

1099
00:47:22,903 --> 00:47:24,072
I'll lead the conversation.

1100
00:47:24,813 --> 00:47:26,972
Yes, please.

1101
00:47:29,242 --> 00:47:31,253
(The house in Seorae Village)

1102
00:47:33,852 --> 00:47:34,852
Hello.

1103
00:47:35,583 --> 00:47:36,583
Who is it?

1104
00:47:36,622 --> 00:47:37,622
It's Cheol Hyeon.

1105
00:47:37,623 --> 00:47:38,951
- What are you doing? - I'm working out.

1106
00:47:38,952 --> 00:47:40,892
I didn't recognize you at all.

1107
00:47:41,662 --> 00:47:42,891
Where have you been today?

1108
00:47:42,892 --> 00:47:44,792
- Did you just wake up? - Yes.

1109
00:47:44,793 --> 00:47:48,432
I went to sleep at 9am, but Jung Sub, Ji Won, and Yun Jae...

1110
00:47:48,702 --> 00:47:50,502
went to sleep at 10am.

1111
00:47:50,503 --> 00:47:51,571
The three of them?

1112
00:47:51,572 --> 00:47:53,733
Yes. The three of them.

1113
00:47:54,742 --> 00:47:56,202
- Was it fun? - Yes.

1114
00:47:56,403 --> 00:47:59,141
We drank too much by the end.

1115
00:47:59,142 --> 00:48:00,472
You drank a lot?

1116
00:48:00,543 --> 00:48:02,713
Jung Sub and Ji Won...

1117
00:48:04,452 --> 00:48:06,452
had a little trouble.

1118
00:48:06,813 --> 00:48:07,852
Why?

1119
00:48:08,383 --> 00:48:10,383
They had some communication issues.

1120
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:13,653
It seems like they worked it out.

1121
00:48:15,693 --> 00:48:18,463
That's interesting.

1122
00:48:20,662 --> 00:48:22,931
Drinking until 10am?

1123
00:48:22,932 --> 00:48:24,003
Are they in college or what?

1124
00:48:24,673 --> 00:48:27,031
We hadn't drunk for that long before.

1125
00:48:27,032 --> 00:48:29,872
I was sad about it and wasn't too happy.

1126
00:48:29,972 --> 00:48:32,442
Because they were having such a good time...

1127
00:48:32,443 --> 00:48:34,382
that they stayed up that late,

1128
00:48:34,383 --> 00:48:35,442
and I wasn't there.

1129
00:48:35,443 --> 00:48:37,312
And also, I have no idea...

1130
00:48:37,313 --> 00:48:38,983
what happened there.

1131
00:48:40,653 --> 00:48:43,322
Let me check my laundry.

1132
00:48:44,423 --> 00:48:45,992
(Sighing)

1133
00:48:50,863 --> 00:48:52,693
- She went downstairs. - Goodness.

1134
00:48:52,932 --> 00:48:55,003
To see what they did there.

1135
00:48:56,133 --> 00:48:58,372
- She's at the scene. - "What did they do?"

1136
00:48:58,572 --> 00:48:59,971
As if she was a crime scene investigator.

1137
00:48:59,972 --> 00:49:01,443
- A crime scene investigator. What? - What?

1138
00:49:05,642 --> 00:49:07,443
(Looking around the hideout)

1139
00:49:15,722 --> 00:49:18,722
(The traces of their drinking are left in the sink.)

1140
00:49:36,142 --> 00:49:38,812
After learning about the fact that I didn't know,

1141
00:49:38,813 --> 00:49:40,673
I became curious, but I didn't want to about it either.

1142
00:49:42,483 --> 00:49:43,483
Gosh.

1143
00:49:43,484 --> 00:49:46,282
I didn't feel good for some reason.

1144
00:49:46,653 --> 00:49:47,782
Right.

1145
00:49:49,153 --> 00:49:50,322
(Letting out a sigh)

1146
00:49:54,693 --> 00:49:57,192
- You scared me. - I'm sorry.

1147
00:49:57,193 --> 00:49:58,261
- Well, yesterday... - Yes.

1148
00:49:58,262 --> 00:50:00,391
- It's not yesterday. - Today.

1149
00:50:00,392 --> 00:50:01,801
I heard...

1150
00:50:01,802 --> 00:50:04,003
- drank until this morning. - Right.

1151
00:50:04,503 --> 00:50:06,173
I hadn't seen him in a while,

1152
00:50:06,432 --> 00:50:08,702
- Were you happy? - so I was excited to see him.

1153
00:50:08,843 --> 00:50:10,871
That's good. I wish I had been there.

1154
00:50:10,872 --> 00:50:13,011
- I know! - I'm sorry.

1155
00:50:13,012 --> 00:50:14,272
You don't have to be sorry.

1156
00:50:14,273 --> 00:50:15,882
No wonder you weren't there. It was so late.

1157
00:50:15,883 --> 00:50:17,612
I feel bad for myself...

1158
00:50:17,613 --> 00:50:19,112
because I couldn't have fun with you all there.

1159
00:50:19,113 --> 00:50:21,621
It was indeed fun. It would've been nice if you had been there.

1160
00:50:21,622 --> 00:50:23,552
But there will be more opportunities.

1161
00:50:23,753 --> 00:50:25,192
You slept with your makeup on, right?

1162
00:50:25,193 --> 00:50:27,192
I just passed out once I came into the room.

1163
00:50:27,193 --> 00:50:29,492
I can imagine. What time did you come in?

1164
00:50:29,892 --> 00:50:31,733
- At 10:30am? - Around 10am?

1165
00:50:31,963 --> 00:50:33,662
- You came in at around 10am? - Yes.

1166
00:50:33,963 --> 00:50:35,963
Right. Are you kidding me?

1167
00:50:38,233 --> 00:50:39,371
How can you all drink until 10am...

1168
00:50:39,372 --> 00:50:41,031
after coming back from a trip?

1169
00:50:41,032 --> 00:50:43,641
- I know. - It's impressive.

1170
00:50:43,642 --> 00:50:45,241
Thankfully, you're not going to work today.

1171
00:50:45,242 --> 00:50:47,042
That's why we stayed up later.

1172
00:50:47,043 --> 00:50:50,012
- So you enjoyed yourselves more. - Yes. It was fun.

1173
00:50:53,952 --> 00:50:56,383
Who was Jae Hyung matched with?

1174
00:50:56,722 --> 00:50:58,452
- Was it Ju Yeon? - Yes.

1175
00:50:59,793 --> 00:51:01,152
It was special, to be honest.

1176
00:51:01,153 --> 00:51:04,321
We found out who was related to whom in Gangwon Province,

1177
00:51:04,322 --> 00:51:06,161
and a new participant joined us.

1178
00:51:06,162 --> 00:51:09,531
It's understandable that they drank together.

1179
00:51:09,532 --> 00:51:11,601
They drank all night until 10am...

1180
00:51:11,602 --> 00:51:13,031
although they were tired.

1181
00:51:13,032 --> 00:51:16,371
"Did they have a reason..."

1182
00:51:16,372 --> 00:51:17,742
"why they wanted to stay there?"

1183
00:51:17,843 --> 00:51:19,813
I can't help but wonder.

1184
00:51:20,673 --> 00:51:22,511
Is everyone coming home?

1185
00:51:22,512 --> 00:51:24,313
Jae Hyung will come home after work.

1186
00:51:24,483 --> 00:51:26,012
- Who? - Park Jae Hyung.

1187
00:51:26,253 --> 00:51:27,351
Park Jae Hyung.

1188
00:51:27,352 --> 00:51:28,952
When is my brother getting off?

1189
00:51:29,153 --> 00:51:30,653
I hope he comes home and cooks.

1190
00:51:31,253 --> 00:51:33,721
"Udon hot pot?"

1191
00:51:33,722 --> 00:51:34,793
Shall we eat this?

1192
00:51:35,492 --> 00:51:36,562
That sounds good.

1193
00:51:36,563 --> 00:51:37,862
It's so fun...

1194
00:51:37,863 --> 00:51:40,593
that my brother is on a date.

1195
00:51:41,302 --> 00:51:42,732
He's out with Yun Ha.

1196
00:51:42,733 --> 00:51:44,002
Do you think they'll click?

1197
00:51:44,003 --> 00:51:45,772
You said he had a good sense of humour,

1198
00:51:45,773 --> 00:51:48,371
- so they must hit it off. - They will?

1199
00:51:48,372 --> 00:51:49,871
Yun Jae has something...

1200
00:51:49,872 --> 00:51:52,312
that makes me want to tease him.

1201
00:51:52,313 --> 00:51:53,871
- Right? - Maybe...

1202
00:51:53,872 --> 00:51:56,142
because he arrived alone, looking blankly,

1203
00:51:56,443 --> 00:51:58,411
I wanted to tease him.

1204
00:51:58,412 --> 00:51:59,582
I held back, though.

1205
00:51:59,583 --> 00:52:01,523
- It's fun to tease him. - I can imagine.

1206
00:52:02,352 --> 00:52:03,821
He looks like tofu a little.

1207
00:52:03,822 --> 00:52:04,822
Tofu?

1208
00:52:05,593 --> 00:52:06,622
It's so funny.

1209
00:52:06,722 --> 00:52:08,863
(A crybaby-faced participant returns home.)

1210
00:52:10,193 --> 00:52:11,963
Who is it?

1211
00:52:12,363 --> 00:52:13,463
Is it Jae Hyung?

1212
00:52:14,063 --> 00:52:16,633
- He opened the door hard. - It's Yong Woo.

1213
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:17,971
Yong Woo.

1214
00:52:17,972 --> 00:52:19,733
- Hello. - Hello.

1215
00:52:20,273 --> 00:52:22,903
(Going upstairs to get changed)

1216
00:52:23,872 --> 00:52:25,812
(The glutton got changed and came downstairs.)

1217
00:52:25,813 --> 00:52:27,312
- What are you eating? - Udon.

1218
00:52:27,313 --> 00:52:30,042
Someone bought kimchi udon hot pot.

1219
00:52:30,043 --> 00:52:31,653
That? I remember.

1220
00:52:32,713 --> 00:52:34,051
You didn't have any other good food?

1221
00:52:34,052 --> 00:52:35,821
There are steak and meat here.

1222
00:52:35,822 --> 00:52:37,321
You have to keep eating meat.

1223
00:52:37,322 --> 00:52:39,652
Meat again? Are we only eating meat?

1224
00:52:39,653 --> 00:52:40,721
Well, if I cook meat,

1225
00:52:40,722 --> 00:52:42,062
- do you want some or not? - I do.

1226
00:52:42,063 --> 00:52:43,392
- Of course, we do. - You'll have some?

1227
00:52:44,222 --> 00:52:45,963
- I knew you'd want some. - Right.

1228
00:52:46,233 --> 00:52:47,963
- It's not that bad. - Is that so?

1229
00:52:48,532 --> 00:52:50,232
Watching the clip yesterday,

1230
00:52:50,233 --> 00:52:54,301
I was fascinated by her dad.

1231
00:52:54,302 --> 00:52:56,043
- Right. - He was so cute.

1232
00:52:56,343 --> 00:52:57,542
He was cute.

1233
00:52:57,543 --> 00:52:58,912
My dad is.

1234
00:52:59,072 --> 00:53:01,112
I see where Jae Hyung got his cuteness from.

1235
00:53:01,113 --> 00:53:03,241
Did I get the impression...

1236
00:53:03,242 --> 00:53:05,912
that Jae Hyung was cute from him?

1237
00:53:06,153 --> 00:53:08,951
- He never acted cute with me, - Right.

1238
00:53:08,952 --> 00:53:11,083
- He seems cute? - but I keep thinking he's cute.

1239
00:53:11,182 --> 00:53:12,222
Well, he's not.

1240
00:53:12,552 --> 00:53:13,592
He's the epitome of cuteness.

1241
00:53:13,593 --> 00:53:15,121
If someone said...

1242
00:53:15,122 --> 00:53:16,962
- my brother was cute, - Yes.

1243
00:53:16,963 --> 00:53:19,233
- You'd suffer. - it'd be so hard for me.

1244
00:53:20,432 --> 00:53:22,563
(Meanwhile, her sibling is...)

1245
00:53:22,833 --> 00:53:23,902
It might be too big.

1246
00:53:23,903 --> 00:53:25,333
(Yun Ha and Yun Jae on a beef brisket selected date)

1247
00:53:31,242 --> 00:53:32,343
- It's good. - It's tasty.

1248
00:53:33,313 --> 00:53:34,642
(Looking around)

1249
00:53:35,713 --> 00:53:38,052
I'm looking around like a meerkat, right?

1250
00:53:38,883 --> 00:53:39,883
You have...

1251
00:53:42,023 --> 00:53:43,023
the face of a puppy.

1252
00:53:43,952 --> 00:53:45,722
That's good.

1253
00:53:46,793 --> 00:53:48,423
You have such a nice nose.

1254
00:53:48,762 --> 00:53:50,762
I got it from my dad. He has a high-bridged nose.

1255
00:53:50,863 --> 00:53:51,863
I saw it.

1256
00:53:51,992 --> 00:53:54,032
- He looked so handsome. - Yes.

1257
00:53:54,463 --> 00:53:55,931
Where did you live in China?

1258
00:53:55,932 --> 00:53:57,002
I lived in Beijing.

1259
00:53:57,003 --> 00:53:58,972
I lived in Suzhou.

1260
00:53:59,432 --> 00:54:01,971
You must have written everything in Chinese for studying.

1261
00:54:01,972 --> 00:54:04,042
- Well, I did. - You must be fluent in Chinese.

1262
00:54:04,043 --> 00:54:05,741
Well, Ji Won is better.

1263
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:07,512
Is there anything she's bad at?

1264
00:54:07,813 --> 00:54:09,012
Well, she's not dating now, so...

1265
00:54:11,782 --> 00:54:13,153
I was going to ask you later...

1266
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:15,653
how you feel about going on two dates with me.

1267
00:54:17,883 --> 00:54:18,992
I love it.

1268
00:54:19,492 --> 00:54:22,062
- I love his quick answer. - That's good.

1269
00:54:22,063 --> 00:54:23,962
He's shy and clumsy in everything,

1270
00:54:23,963 --> 00:54:25,931
- Right. - but he doesn't hesitate...

1271
00:54:25,932 --> 00:54:27,832
- to express his feelings. - He didn't look nervous just now.

1272
00:54:27,833 --> 00:54:29,002
- Right. - "I love it."

1273
00:54:29,003 --> 00:54:31,063
- He's charming. - This is good.

1274
00:54:31,972 --> 00:54:34,032
How you feel about going on two dates with me.

1275
00:54:36,202 --> 00:54:37,242
I love it.

1276
00:54:37,903 --> 00:54:38,943
Me too.

1277
00:54:41,142 --> 00:54:43,141
You're not cold, right?

1278
00:54:43,142 --> 00:54:44,182
A little.

1279
00:54:44,443 --> 00:54:45,753
Do you want to cover yourself with this?

1280
00:54:45,813 --> 00:54:47,781
I'm okay because I'm wearing a sweater.

1281
00:54:47,782 --> 00:54:49,883
I'm okay. Thank you, though.

1282
00:54:50,423 --> 00:54:52,852
You might get cold.

1283
00:54:53,052 --> 00:54:54,152
This sweater is thick enough.

1284
00:54:54,153 --> 00:54:56,821
Your cologne smells so good.

1285
00:54:56,822 --> 00:54:59,192
- Is that so? - What is it?

1286
00:54:59,193 --> 00:55:01,362
I just grabbed a random one at a beauty product store.

1287
00:55:01,363 --> 00:55:02,402
- Really? - Yes.

1288
00:55:02,403 --> 00:55:03,762
You're a tough guy.

1289
00:55:04,302 --> 00:55:05,372
Not really.

1290
00:55:05,773 --> 00:55:09,101
I just... I did smell it.

1291
00:55:09,102 --> 00:55:11,512
- I thought its smell was the best. - It smells really nice.

1292
00:55:12,213 --> 00:55:14,113
You're down-to-earth.

1293
00:55:15,282 --> 00:55:16,483
- I am. - Really.

1294
00:55:17,043 --> 00:55:19,253
I like that about you.

1295
00:55:20,113 --> 00:55:22,952
I don't have time to be pretentious, nor do I want to.

1296
00:55:24,653 --> 00:55:25,693
So...

1297
00:55:31,322 --> 00:55:33,562
He seems sincere.

1298
00:55:33,563 --> 00:55:35,431
He expressed...

1299
00:55:35,432 --> 00:55:38,571
how he felt honestly and simply.

1300
00:55:38,572 --> 00:55:42,543
I felt his sincerity better during the conversation.

1301
00:55:44,003 --> 00:55:47,371
I've been eating a lot of strong-tasting foods here.

1302
00:55:47,372 --> 00:55:48,842
(They're still having dinner.)

1303
00:55:48,843 --> 00:55:50,042
Should we...

1304
00:55:50,043 --> 00:55:52,113
close the entrance door?

1305
00:55:52,412 --> 00:55:54,882
(Ji Won received a message.)

1306
00:55:54,883 --> 00:55:56,152
(It's a secret.)

1307
00:55:56,153 --> 00:55:57,652
(Go to the small room with the phone...)

1308
00:55:57,653 --> 00:55:58,792
(in the hideout.)

1309
00:55:58,793 --> 00:56:00,023
(Then, call this number.)

1310
00:56:00,423 --> 00:56:02,322
- What is that? - What? Call?

1311
00:56:02,563 --> 00:56:04,121
Is she going to talk to someone on the phone?

1312
00:56:04,122 --> 00:56:05,391
(It's a secret.)

1313
00:56:05,392 --> 00:56:06,692
(Go to the small room with the phone...)

1314
00:56:06,693 --> 00:56:08,031
(in the hideout.)

1315
00:56:08,032 --> 00:56:09,333
(Then, call this number.)

1316
00:56:10,432 --> 00:56:12,773
(Sipping water calmly)

1317
00:56:13,833 --> 00:56:15,672
What is it for?

1318
00:56:15,673 --> 00:56:17,242
- It's for pasta. - Yes. It's for pasta.

1319
00:56:17,742 --> 00:56:20,173
(Thankfully, everyone is distracted.)

1320
00:56:30,852 --> 00:56:32,722
(This is the room.)

1321
00:56:34,122 --> 00:56:35,162
"The small room?"

1322
00:56:52,372 --> 00:56:55,713
You'll be going on a date with Cheol Hyeon tomorrow.

1323
00:56:55,943 --> 00:56:58,983
Either you or your sibling can go on a date, but not both.

1324
00:56:59,452 --> 00:57:01,923
Only one of you can go on a date.

1325
00:57:02,052 --> 00:57:04,991
Press the button if you made up your mind.

1326
00:57:04,992 --> 00:57:07,023
Number one, I'll go on a date.

1327
00:57:07,222 --> 00:57:09,793
Number two, my brother, Yun Jae, will go on a date.

1328
00:57:09,892 --> 00:57:12,062
If both siblings give up for each other,

1329
00:57:12,063 --> 00:57:14,193
neither of them can go out on a date.

1330
00:57:14,293 --> 00:57:16,431
Even if your date is confirmed,

1331
00:57:16,432 --> 00:57:20,071
if your date gives up, you can't go out on a date either.

1332
00:57:20,072 --> 00:57:22,672
- What? - Why are you doing this?

1333
00:57:22,673 --> 00:57:23,673
What does it mean?

1334
00:57:23,674 --> 00:57:24,871
So neither of them might not be able to go out...

1335
00:57:24,872 --> 00:57:25,872
if they give up for each other.

1336
00:57:25,873 --> 00:57:27,542
- Just do it then. - You should just do it.

1337
00:57:27,543 --> 00:57:30,342
Then her brother can't go out.

1338
00:57:30,343 --> 00:57:32,253
Number one, I'll go on a date.

1339
00:57:32,583 --> 00:57:35,153
Number two, my sibling Yun Jae will go on a date.

1340
00:57:35,383 --> 00:57:39,052
Say "I want to hear it again" if you want to hear it again.

1341
00:57:40,892 --> 00:57:44,793
(What choice will Ji Won make?)

1342
00:57:49,302 --> 00:57:51,463
I'll choose number two.

1343
00:57:52,003 --> 00:57:55,443
(She should press the button.)

1344
00:57:55,602 --> 00:57:57,943
(Anyway, she chose to give Yun Jae a chance to go out.)

1345
00:57:58,072 --> 00:58:01,043
Why do you want your sibling to go on a date?

1346
00:58:04,182 --> 00:58:06,083
I think...

1347
00:58:06,613 --> 00:58:10,883
he needs more time than me.

1348
00:58:11,083 --> 00:58:13,392
That's why I want him to go on a date.

1349
00:58:14,052 --> 00:58:16,992
As soon as I heard it, I thought my brother should go.

1350
00:58:17,262 --> 00:58:19,962
I also thought it was a relief.

1351
00:58:19,963 --> 00:58:22,432
I thought I already spent enough time...

1352
00:58:22,532 --> 00:58:26,072
with Cheol Hyeon.

1353
00:58:26,173 --> 00:58:29,043
If I spend more time with him,

1354
00:58:29,302 --> 00:58:31,942
I might contemplate more.

1355
00:58:31,943 --> 00:58:34,641
So I thought it was a relief...

1356
00:58:34,642 --> 00:58:36,012
that I didn't get to go out with him.

1357
00:58:36,113 --> 00:58:38,043
I respect your choice.

1358
00:58:38,512 --> 00:58:41,982
You can't disclose or discuss the choice you made...

1359
00:58:41,983 --> 00:58:45,092
with your sibling until further notice.

1360
00:58:45,093 --> 00:58:47,051
(What choice do you think Yun Jae will make?)

1361
00:58:47,052 --> 00:58:51,321
I think he would've chosen to go out on a date, of course.

1362
00:58:51,322 --> 00:58:54,062
I think it's better than losing a chance to go on a date,

1363
00:58:54,063 --> 00:58:55,363
being considerate of me,

1364
00:58:55,463 --> 00:58:57,403
which doesn't suit him.

1365
00:58:57,702 --> 00:58:59,903
But in a way, about three percent,

1366
00:59:00,273 --> 00:59:03,403
I would think he's selfish.

1367
00:59:03,503 --> 00:59:05,872
Please hang up and leave the room.

1368
00:59:06,642 --> 00:59:08,043
Thank you.

1369
00:59:09,642 --> 00:59:12,583
(Ji Won gave Yun Jae a chance to go on a date.)

1370
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:16,352
Oh, my. When did you come down?

1371
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:20,451
(It's a secret.)

1372
00:59:20,452 --> 00:59:22,092
(Go to the small room with the phone...)

1373
00:59:22,093 --> 00:59:23,093
(in the hideout. Then, call this number.)

1374
00:59:31,403 --> 00:59:34,532
You'll be going on a date with Jung Sub tomorrow.

1375
00:59:34,872 --> 00:59:37,773
Either you or your sibling can go on a date, but not both.

1376
00:59:38,242 --> 00:59:41,242
Press the button if you made up your mind.

1377
00:59:41,343 --> 00:59:43,313
Number one, I'll go on a date.

1378
00:59:43,583 --> 00:59:46,253
Number two, my brother Jae Hyung will go on a date.

1379
00:59:46,352 --> 00:59:48,012
She should go out on a date.

1380
00:59:48,113 --> 00:59:49,951
Yes. It's important for her.

1381
00:59:49,952 --> 00:59:52,022
- Go. - She will definitely go out.

1382
00:59:52,023 --> 00:59:53,952
- There's an issue. - Yes.

1383
00:59:54,753 --> 00:59:56,463
She shouldn't think about her sibling.

1384
00:59:56,793 --> 00:59:57,892
Her date is interested in someone else.

1385
00:59:59,463 --> 01:00:01,333
Number one, I'll go on a date.

1386
01:00:01,693 --> 01:00:04,333
Number two, my brother Jae Hyung will go on a date.

1387
01:00:06,333 --> 01:00:08,133
(She chose number 2 to give Jae Hyung a chance to go out.)

1388
01:00:09,242 --> 01:00:11,502
Why? You should go out.

1389
01:00:11,503 --> 01:00:13,242
- Really? - It's a plot twist.

1390
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:15,483
I respect your choice.

1391
01:00:15,583 --> 01:00:17,943
Please hang up and leave the room.

1392
01:00:18,383 --> 01:00:22,423
(Se Seung gave Jae Hyung a chance to go on a date.)

1393
01:00:28,052 --> 01:00:30,693
I actually wanted to go on a date very much.

1394
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:33,463
I wanted to know how much Jung Sub's mind has changed.

1395
01:00:33,733 --> 01:00:36,463
So I really wanted to go out with him.

1396
01:00:37,662 --> 01:00:39,931
But I kept thinking about Ju Yeon.

1397
01:00:39,932 --> 01:00:42,641
My brother needs a lot of time to get to know someone...

1398
01:00:42,642 --> 01:00:43,902
as far as I know.

1399
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:45,371
And Ju Yeon said...

1400
01:00:45,372 --> 01:00:47,772
she was happy...

1401
01:00:47,773 --> 01:00:49,543
that things were going well with him.

1402
01:00:49,983 --> 01:00:53,051
So I couldn't help but give up.

1403
01:00:53,052 --> 01:00:54,652
After thinking that,

1404
01:00:54,653 --> 01:00:57,451
I thought Jung Sub might give up as well.

1405
01:00:57,452 --> 01:00:59,752
Considering his personality,

1406
01:00:59,753 --> 01:01:01,222
I thought he would give up everything for Yun Ha.

1407
01:01:01,322 --> 01:01:04,423
If it wasn't going to happen anyway, I should stay loyal to my brother.

1408
01:01:05,133 --> 01:01:07,963
I should stay loyal to him. I thought it turned out well.

1409
01:01:09,003 --> 01:01:11,463
(Se Seung's brother is back at the perfect time.)

1410
01:01:15,843 --> 01:01:17,302
Jae Hyung.

1411
01:01:17,602 --> 01:01:19,812
- Have you had dinner? - Yes, I have.

1412
01:01:19,813 --> 01:01:21,213
Did you eat before coming?

1413
01:01:23,043 --> 01:01:24,043
Yes.

1414
01:01:24,313 --> 01:01:25,983
- He answers so late. - That was dull.

1415
01:01:26,452 --> 01:01:28,083
- It's so... - She sounds upset.

1416
01:01:28,313 --> 01:01:29,523
He answers so late.

1417
01:01:33,552 --> 01:01:36,562
I heard you had put makeup on Yun Jae before he went on a date.

1418
01:01:36,563 --> 01:01:39,593
Yes. I applied the makeup like this. I was hitting him.

1419
01:01:40,432 --> 01:01:42,601
I pretended to dab his face, but I was hitting him.

1420
01:01:42,602 --> 01:01:43,702
That's not bad.

1421
01:01:45,503 --> 01:01:47,972
(Yun Jae who was taken care by Ji Won in the meantime)

1422
01:01:48,572 --> 01:01:51,602
I've never taken a photo on a date with a woman.

1423
01:01:55,483 --> 01:01:57,442
- I tried to pose well, - How do you do this?

1424
01:01:57,443 --> 01:01:58,813
but it didn't go well.

1425
01:02:00,883 --> 01:02:03,752
- In 1, 2, 3. - Honestly, it was a little awkward.

1426
01:02:03,753 --> 01:02:04,753
Let's do this.

1427
01:02:04,754 --> 01:02:07,253
But Yun Jae was even more awkward.

1428
01:02:09,063 --> 01:02:11,161
We tried to strike many poses...

1429
01:02:11,162 --> 01:02:13,633
not to make it awkward.

1430
01:02:14,063 --> 01:02:15,201
It was fun.

1431
01:02:15,202 --> 01:02:16,762
I think the photos came out well too.

1432
01:02:17,102 --> 01:02:19,132
I thought Yun Ha had a great personality.

1433
01:02:19,133 --> 01:02:21,503
I was almost shivering.

1434
01:02:21,602 --> 01:02:25,072
People might usually think...

1435
01:02:25,173 --> 01:02:26,872
I was weird.

1436
01:02:27,242 --> 01:02:30,012
But she tried to wait for me and laughed a lot.

1437
01:02:30,443 --> 01:02:32,351
I had a strong impression...

1438
01:02:32,352 --> 01:02:33,512
- that she was a great person. - Please.

1439
01:02:34,153 --> 01:02:36,222
He's very kind.

1440
01:02:36,322 --> 01:02:38,121
- He took great care of me. - Put this on for now.

1441
01:02:38,122 --> 01:02:39,321
We don't have a blanket.

1442
01:02:39,322 --> 01:02:42,062
- He was very considerate. - Thank you.

1443
01:02:42,063 --> 01:02:43,192
Put this on instead.

1444
01:02:43,193 --> 01:02:44,491
Even though it was cold,

1445
01:02:44,492 --> 01:02:47,563
I felt warm during our date.

1446
01:02:56,102 --> 01:02:58,372
- They look good together. - They do.

1447
01:02:58,472 --> 01:03:00,342
I think it's good...

1448
01:03:00,343 --> 01:03:03,312
that he was nervous. Because when he took care of her,

1449
01:03:03,313 --> 01:03:05,713
it was very obvious that he cared about her.

1450
01:03:06,253 --> 01:03:08,551
She could've been oblivious about it,

1451
01:03:08,552 --> 01:03:10,321
- Because it was so obvious. - but she noticed it.

1452
01:03:10,322 --> 01:03:11,322
That's good.

1453
01:03:11,323 --> 01:03:14,322
(The house in Seorae Village)

1454
01:03:15,023 --> 01:03:18,633
(Someone in white is folding white towels.)

1455
01:03:23,363 --> 01:03:24,431
(It's a secret.)

1456
01:03:24,432 --> 01:03:26,431
(Go to the small room with the phone...)

1457
01:03:26,432 --> 01:03:27,532
(in the hideout. Then, call this number.)

1458
01:03:31,142 --> 01:03:34,173
You'll be going on a date with Ji Won tomorrow.

1459
01:03:34,372 --> 01:03:36,343
Number one, I'll go on a date.

1460
01:03:36,613 --> 01:03:38,912
Number two, my sister Cho A will go on a date.

1461
01:03:39,412 --> 01:03:41,181
Don't you think he will give up?

1462
01:03:41,182 --> 01:03:42,681
I'm 100 percent sure he will give up.

1463
01:03:42,682 --> 01:03:45,321
His priority is to get a brother-in-law.

1464
01:03:45,322 --> 01:03:46,392
I want to hear it again.

1465
01:03:46,552 --> 01:03:49,693
You'll be going on a date with Ji Won tomorrow.

1466
01:03:50,063 --> 01:03:53,032
Either you or your sibling can go on a date, but not both.

1467
01:03:53,233 --> 01:03:54,332
I want to hear it again.

1468
01:03:54,333 --> 01:03:57,463
You'll be going on a date with Ji Won tomorrow.

1469
01:03:57,802 --> 01:03:58,871
I want to hear it again.

1470
01:03:58,872 --> 01:04:00,872
Number one, I'll go on a date.

1471
01:04:01,173 --> 01:04:03,472
Number two, my sister Cho A will go on a date.

1472
01:04:03,872 --> 01:04:06,411
Say "I want to hear it again" if you want to hear it again.

1473
01:04:06,412 --> 01:04:07,642
(He chose number 1 for himself.)

1474
01:04:09,242 --> 01:04:10,482
- What? - He chose himself.

1475
01:04:10,483 --> 01:04:11,741
- That's totally unexpected. - That's unexpected.

1476
01:04:11,742 --> 01:04:14,653
First of all, I couldn't blow the chance.

1477
01:04:15,182 --> 01:04:17,422
Whatever it is, I shouldn't give up.

1478
01:04:17,423 --> 01:04:19,293
I respect your choice.

1479
01:04:19,653 --> 01:04:21,952
Please hang up and leave the room.

1480
01:04:22,523 --> 01:04:23,722
Okay. I'll get going.

1481
01:04:26,262 --> 01:04:29,963
(Cheol Hyeon chose to go on a date.)

1482
01:04:31,333 --> 01:04:34,072
Do you know how to tune in on MBC?

1483
01:04:34,602 --> 01:04:35,742
Do you not know how to do it?

1484
01:04:36,043 --> 01:04:38,142
Do you think I can help you, though?

1485
01:04:38,472 --> 01:04:40,411
I don't think it's a good idea...

1486
01:04:40,412 --> 01:04:41,511
for us to try to figure it out together.

1487
01:04:41,512 --> 01:04:42,712
Figure out what?

1488
01:04:42,713 --> 01:04:43,842
How to turn the TV on.

1489
01:04:43,843 --> 01:04:45,813
I think we should talk about it.

1490
01:04:46,083 --> 01:04:47,153
Nice.

1491
01:04:48,182 --> 01:04:51,152
Which commentator do you prefer?

1492
01:04:51,153 --> 01:04:52,852
Ahn Jung Hwan? Or...

1493
01:04:53,793 --> 01:04:56,363
(Cho A is back.)

1494
01:04:58,293 --> 01:04:59,332
- A man with warm hands. - Oh, my.

1495
01:04:59,333 --> 01:05:00,333
- She's back. - Cho A.

1496
01:05:00,334 --> 01:05:01,931
Why did you come in so quietly?

1497
01:05:01,932 --> 01:05:03,362
You're back, my sibling.

1498
01:05:03,363 --> 01:05:04,661
- Hurry up and come down. - I'm back.

1499
01:05:04,662 --> 01:05:05,802
Welcome back.

1500
01:05:13,613 --> 01:05:15,383
(She got changed quickly to go to the 1st floor.)

1501
01:05:16,113 --> 01:05:18,313
You kind of look like a Teddy bear today.

1502
01:05:20,052 --> 01:05:21,781
- You look cute. - Do I?

1503
01:05:21,782 --> 01:05:22,782
- Yes. - Yes.

1504
01:05:23,122 --> 01:05:24,622
It's something like that.

1505
01:05:24,782 --> 01:05:25,792
(It's a secret.)

1506
01:05:25,793 --> 01:05:26,793
(Go to the small room with the phone...)

1507
01:05:26,793 --> 01:05:27,793
(in the hideout. Then, call this number.)

1508
01:05:31,863 --> 01:05:34,593
You'll be going on a date with Yong Woo.

1509
01:05:35,063 --> 01:05:36,963
Number one, I'll go on a date.

1510
01:05:37,363 --> 01:05:39,833
Number two, my brother Cheol Hyeon will go on a date.

1511
01:05:40,633 --> 01:05:43,972
(Cheol Hyeon already chose himself.)

1512
01:05:44,503 --> 01:05:46,972
(What will his sister Cho A choose?)

1513
01:05:48,983 --> 01:05:50,412
(She chose number 1 for herself.)

1514
01:05:50,642 --> 01:05:53,552
Why do you want to go on a date?

1515
01:05:54,012 --> 01:05:55,423
I want to talk.

1516
01:05:55,983 --> 01:05:57,982
(Which number do you think your sibling chose?)

1517
01:05:57,983 --> 01:05:59,052
Number one.

1518
01:06:00,122 --> 01:06:01,653
He would've picked number one without a thought.

1519
01:06:01,822 --> 01:06:03,161
She knows exactly.

1520
01:06:03,162 --> 01:06:04,422
And she still chose number one?

1521
01:06:04,423 --> 01:06:05,832
Siblings are different.

1522
01:06:05,833 --> 01:06:06,833
I know.

1523
01:06:06,932 --> 01:06:09,332
He always does...

1524
01:06:09,333 --> 01:06:11,002
what he wants.

1525
01:06:11,003 --> 01:06:13,531
Both siblings chose number one...

1526
01:06:13,532 --> 01:06:14,672
to go out on a date.

1527
01:06:14,673 --> 01:06:16,642
You guys are ridiculous.

1528
01:06:17,043 --> 01:06:20,173
You'll be given another chance to choose later.

1529
01:06:20,372 --> 01:06:23,613
(Cho A chose to go on a date.)

1530
01:06:25,713 --> 01:06:26,752
(It's a secret.)

1531
01:06:26,753 --> 01:06:28,152
(Go to the small room with the phone...)

1532
01:06:28,153 --> 01:06:29,153
(in the hideout. Then, call this number.)

1533
01:06:32,193 --> 01:06:34,753
(Cheerful humming and rhythmical steps)

1534
01:06:34,822 --> 01:06:37,762
You'll be going on a date with Cho A.

1535
01:06:37,863 --> 01:06:41,062
Either you or your sibling can go on a date, but not both.

1536
01:06:41,063 --> 01:06:42,833
"This is pure luck."

1537
01:06:43,202 --> 01:06:45,733
"It might not work out. What do I do?"

1538
01:06:46,532 --> 01:06:49,471
(Cho A already chose to go on a date with Yong Woo.)

1539
01:06:49,472 --> 01:06:51,443
Number one, I'll go on a date.

1540
01:06:51,773 --> 01:06:54,273
Number two, my sister Ju Yeon will go on a date.

1541
01:06:54,343 --> 01:06:57,083
(Will he choose to go on a date with Cho A or give up?)

1542
01:06:58,142 --> 01:06:59,782
(He chose number 2 to give Ju Yeon a chance to go out.)

1543
01:07:00,052 --> 01:07:03,052
Why do you want your sibling to go on a date?

1544
01:07:03,352 --> 01:07:04,753
At some point,

1545
01:07:04,852 --> 01:07:07,293
Ju Yeon's interest changed a little.

1546
01:07:08,523 --> 01:07:12,162
I do want to go out on a date too,

1547
01:07:12,762 --> 01:07:15,333
but I think it'd be nice if Ju Yeon can have a good time.

1548
01:07:15,833 --> 01:07:19,133
After spending time with Jae Hyung,

1549
01:07:19,233 --> 01:07:22,031
she said he was charming and she wanted to get to know more about him

1550
01:07:22,032 --> 01:07:25,141
It's probably after she went to a karaoke with him on a date.

1551
01:07:25,142 --> 01:07:26,672
She almost became a fan.

1552
01:07:26,673 --> 01:07:29,342
She never said anything strongly like that,

1553
01:07:29,343 --> 01:07:30,911
especially about a man...

1554
01:07:30,912 --> 01:07:32,582
or a man's charm.

1555
01:07:32,583 --> 01:07:36,781
So I was like, "Okay. You go on a date."

1556
01:07:36,782 --> 01:07:37,923
"I'll give you a chance."

1557
01:07:38,222 --> 01:07:40,693
I pressed the number...

1558
01:07:41,293 --> 01:07:42,392
so that she can go on a date.

1559
01:07:42,793 --> 01:07:44,122
I knew it.

1560
01:07:44,463 --> 01:07:45,662
Cho A would be sad.

1561
01:07:47,193 --> 01:07:49,903
- Have you had dinner? - Yes. Just now.

1562
01:07:50,063 --> 01:07:51,602
- Come down after you're done. - Okay.

1563
01:07:52,833 --> 01:07:55,133
(Jae Hyun called Se Seung into the hideout.)

1564
01:07:55,773 --> 01:07:58,571
I wanted to talk with my sister...

1565
01:07:58,572 --> 01:08:00,542
in the hideout once.

1566
01:08:00,543 --> 01:08:01,613
Why did you call me?

1567
01:08:01,943 --> 01:08:04,082
Eat. Let's eat.

1568
01:08:04,083 --> 01:08:05,083
- I... - I'm full.

1569
01:08:05,143 --> 01:08:07,883
You are? I'm a little hungry.

1570
01:08:07,982 --> 01:08:11,152
(He told her to eat, but he's eating it first.)

1571
01:08:11,622 --> 01:08:12,952
Are you curious about Ji Won?

1572
01:08:13,853 --> 01:08:15,562
- What? - Are you curious about Ji Won?

1573
01:08:15,963 --> 01:08:19,362
Why do you ask so suddenly?

1574
01:08:20,662 --> 01:08:22,192
I am curious about her.

1575
01:08:22,433 --> 01:08:25,802
Because I don't remember talking to her at all.

1576
01:08:25,803 --> 01:08:28,071
Honestly, I think I got a lot closer...

1577
01:08:28,072 --> 01:08:29,902
- to Yun Ha and Ju Yeon. - Right.

1578
01:08:30,242 --> 01:08:31,503
Cho A thinks...

1579
01:08:31,603 --> 01:08:33,241
- She thinks you're a cute brother. - Yes. It feels like it.

1580
01:08:33,242 --> 01:08:36,812
I don't understand why people think you're cute.

1581
01:08:36,912 --> 01:08:38,012
- What? - It's annoying.

1582
01:08:38,013 --> 01:08:39,183
I usually...

1583
01:08:40,452 --> 01:08:42,383
They call you sweetheart.

1584
01:08:43,022 --> 01:08:44,722
I'm the sweetheart.

1585
01:08:44,723 --> 01:08:47,423
I can't believe my brother is called sweetheart.

1586
01:08:47,593 --> 01:08:49,622
I want to put ice in this.

1587
01:08:49,822 --> 01:08:50,892
Do you want some?

1588
01:08:50,893 --> 01:08:52,263
I think you'll like this.

1589
01:08:57,062 --> 01:08:58,833
(Jung Sub in the meantime)

1590
01:08:59,803 --> 01:09:01,232
(He's playing basketball to cure a hangover.)

1591
01:09:07,072 --> 01:09:09,282
(The hangover is cured as he sweated.)

1592
01:09:11,843 --> 01:09:14,083
(Ji Won was going down.)

1593
01:09:14,583 --> 01:09:17,651
Hello. How are you feeling?

1594
01:09:17,652 --> 01:09:18,752
I'm fine.

1595
01:09:18,753 --> 01:09:19,852
- You're fine? - I feel tired, though.

1596
01:09:19,853 --> 01:09:20,892
You must be very tired.

1597
01:09:20,893 --> 01:09:22,762
We stayed up all night.

1598
01:09:22,763 --> 01:09:23,763
All night?

1599
01:09:23,764 --> 01:09:25,022
- We stayed up until late morning. - Let's...

1600
01:09:25,122 --> 01:09:26,463
Until late morning?

1601
01:09:26,562 --> 01:09:28,061
- But it was fun. - I'm so sorry.

1602
01:09:28,062 --> 01:09:30,103
You don't have to be sorry at all.

1603
01:09:30,662 --> 01:09:32,231
You put the shirt on in the wrong way, didn't you?

1604
01:09:32,232 --> 01:09:34,472
- It's twisted like this. - It's fashion.

1605
01:09:34,473 --> 01:09:36,442
Is it? I don't know very much about that.

1606
01:09:36,742 --> 01:09:38,302
- It looks pretty. - It does?

1607
01:09:38,303 --> 01:09:41,013
- Are you working again? - Yes, I am.

1608
01:09:43,442 --> 01:09:44,512
(It's a secret.)

1609
01:09:44,513 --> 01:09:45,951
(Use the phone on the 1st floor and call this number.)

1610
01:09:45,952 --> 01:09:47,052
(Do not say anything even if someone asks about it.)

1611
01:09:47,053 --> 01:09:49,853
What? Hold on.

1612
01:09:57,662 --> 01:10:00,763
You'll be going on a date with Se Seung tomorrow.

1613
01:10:01,062 --> 01:10:02,933
Number one, I'll go on a date.

1614
01:10:03,303 --> 01:10:05,603
Number two, my sister Yun Ha will go on a date.

1615
01:10:06,032 --> 01:10:07,872
Oh, gosh. I want to hear it again.

1616
01:10:08,333 --> 01:10:10,102
- You'll be going on a date... - What's going on?

1617
01:10:10,103 --> 01:10:11,402
with Se Seung tomorrow.

1618
01:10:11,772 --> 01:10:14,812
Either you or your sibling can go on a date, but not both.

1619
01:10:15,173 --> 01:10:17,742
Only one of you can go on a date.

1620
01:10:18,982 --> 01:10:21,411
"So this is how it goes?"

1621
01:10:21,412 --> 01:10:22,482
"It's so fun."

1622
01:10:22,853 --> 01:10:25,352
When our date was matched the day before,

1623
01:10:25,353 --> 01:10:28,053
I thought it was good because I could go on a date again.

1624
01:10:28,152 --> 01:10:30,122
I thought it was nice to have a chance.

1625
01:10:34,532 --> 01:10:35,593
This is tough.

1626
01:10:35,902 --> 01:10:36,963
What is it?

1627
01:10:37,263 --> 01:10:39,072
(The back of a man who can't talk about it)

1628
01:10:39,633 --> 01:10:40,633
Wait.

1629
01:10:40,702 --> 01:10:42,303
I contemplated a lot.

1630
01:10:43,603 --> 01:10:44,702
What do I do?

1631
01:10:45,372 --> 01:10:47,043
(Jung Sub who was contemplating for a long time...)

1632
01:10:47,572 --> 01:10:49,882
(carefully made a decision.)

1633
01:10:49,883 --> 01:10:51,482
I contemplated a lot.

1634
01:10:51,583 --> 01:10:53,781
But I thought my sister had a chance.

1635
01:10:53,782 --> 01:10:55,922
So I picked number one.

1636
01:10:55,923 --> 01:10:57,952
(Jung Sub chose to go on a date.)

1637
01:10:58,053 --> 01:11:01,022
Why do you want to go on a date?

1638
01:11:01,293 --> 01:11:02,492
I just want to do it.

1639
01:11:02,963 --> 01:11:05,561
I didn't want my sister...

1640
01:11:05,562 --> 01:11:06,932
to lose such a good opportunity.

1641
01:11:06,933 --> 01:11:09,962
So I was like, "Should I choose number two?"

1642
01:11:09,963 --> 01:11:11,901
But then, I wanted to go on a date too.

1643
01:11:11,902 --> 01:11:13,771
I wanted to talk with Se Seung.

1644
01:11:13,772 --> 01:11:16,602
I wanted to ask how it was in Gangwon Province.

1645
01:11:16,603 --> 01:11:18,571
I respect your choice.

1646
01:11:18,572 --> 01:11:20,912
Please hang up and leave the room.

1647
01:11:29,982 --> 01:11:32,383
Please hang up and leave the room.

1648
01:11:32,692 --> 01:11:34,492
(He left the house.)

1649
01:11:37,062 --> 01:11:38,321
Where is he going?

1650
01:11:38,322 --> 01:11:40,293
The only thing I heard was "I just want to do it."

1651
01:11:42,503 --> 01:11:43,503
(It's a secret.)

1652
01:11:43,503 --> 01:11:44,503
(Go to the small room with the phone...)

1653
01:11:44,503 --> 01:11:45,503
(in the hideout. Then, call this number.)

1654
01:11:49,572 --> 01:11:52,343
You'll be going on a date with Jae Hyung.

1655
01:11:52,742 --> 01:11:55,742
Either you or your sibling can go on a date, but not both.

1656
01:11:56,083 --> 01:11:58,643
Only one of you can go on a date.

1657
01:11:59,043 --> 01:12:02,013
Press the button if you made up your mind.

1658
01:12:02,412 --> 01:12:04,253
Number one, I'll go on a date.

1659
01:12:04,652 --> 01:12:07,022
Number two, my brother Yong Woo will go on a date.

1660
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:09,621
If both siblings give up for each other,

1661
01:12:09,622 --> 01:12:11,763
neither of them can go out on a date.

1662
01:12:12,192 --> 01:12:14,292
Even if your date is confirmed,

1663
01:12:14,293 --> 01:12:15,932
if your date gives up,

1664
01:12:15,933 --> 01:12:17,833
you can't go out on a date either.

1665
01:12:18,263 --> 01:12:21,902
Say "I want to hear it again" if you want to hear it again.

1666
01:12:22,103 --> 01:12:23,242
I want to hear it again.

1667
01:12:23,843 --> 01:12:25,942
(Will she choose to go on a date?)

1668
01:12:26,072 --> 01:12:28,173
(Will she give her brother a chance go to on a date?)

1669
01:12:28,772 --> 01:12:32,112
(Yong Woo already chose to give Ju Yeon a chance to go on a date.)

1670
01:12:33,152 --> 01:12:34,411
(She pressed the button.)

1671
01:12:34,412 --> 01:12:37,281
I tried to think about what choice he would've made first.

1672
01:12:37,282 --> 01:12:39,191
I thought he would've given up.

1673
01:12:39,192 --> 01:12:42,352
He knows his relationship with her is strong.

1674
01:12:42,353 --> 01:12:45,622
And he always encourages me to date.

1675
01:12:45,723 --> 01:12:47,191
I thought he would've given up for me.

1676
01:12:47,192 --> 01:12:49,263
So I chose to go on a date.

1677
01:12:49,362 --> 01:12:52,161
I was actually worried. Ju Yeon might've been considerate...

1678
01:12:52,162 --> 01:12:53,302
and wanted me to go on a date.

1679
01:12:53,303 --> 01:12:55,672
She might've pressed the button so that I could go out.

1680
01:12:55,673 --> 01:12:57,372
It's better if one of us can date at least.

1681
01:12:58,143 --> 01:12:59,741
They read each other's minds.

1682
01:12:59,742 --> 01:13:01,472
- This is how it should go. - Right.

1683
01:13:01,473 --> 01:13:04,412
Why do you want to go on a date?

1684
01:13:07,312 --> 01:13:09,112
We didn't spend much time together.

1685
01:13:09,923 --> 01:13:11,452
(She shyly talks about her feelings.)

1686
01:13:12,253 --> 01:13:13,552
It's better to grab the ball like this.

1687
01:13:13,553 --> 01:13:15,692
Because it goes like this.

1688
01:13:16,223 --> 01:13:17,321
This is how it feels.

1689
01:13:17,322 --> 01:13:19,793
Your sibling gave you a chance to go on a date.

1690
01:13:20,232 --> 01:13:21,933
You have a wonderful brother.

1691
01:13:22,362 --> 01:13:23,502
Your date will be fixed...

1692
01:13:23,503 --> 01:13:26,872
only when Jae Hyung doesn't give up.

1693
01:13:27,303 --> 01:13:30,242
He gave up for me as expected. That's great.

1694
01:13:30,303 --> 01:13:32,042
Of course, he should give me a chance.

1695
01:13:32,043 --> 01:13:34,311
Things are going well for him, but I'm still...

1696
01:13:34,312 --> 01:13:35,673
I am thankful, though.

1697
01:13:36,242 --> 01:13:39,512
I thought I had to spend more time with Jae Hyung.

1698
01:13:39,513 --> 01:13:40,553
I was like, "This is great."

1699
01:13:42,452 --> 01:13:43,522
It's crazy.

1700
01:13:46,723 --> 01:13:48,152
I got goosebumps.

1701
01:13:48,393 --> 01:13:50,062
I need to go and see my brother.

1702
01:13:50,463 --> 01:13:52,293
I acknowledge my defeat.

1703
01:13:52,423 --> 01:13:53,963
- Good job. - You did a great job.

1704
01:13:56,103 --> 01:13:57,432
- Mr. Lee Yong Woo. - Yes.

1705
01:13:57,433 --> 01:13:59,272
- See me for a moment. - Sorry?

1706
01:13:59,532 --> 01:14:01,473
- See me for a moment. - What is it?

1707
01:14:01,902 --> 01:14:03,571
- Did you have a phone call today? - What?

1708
01:14:03,572 --> 01:14:04,902
- Did you use the phone? - What phone?

1709
01:14:05,103 --> 01:14:06,612
The phone in the house.

1710
01:14:07,812 --> 01:14:08,973
- The phone in the house? - Yes.

1711
01:14:09,543 --> 01:14:11,281
- The phone in the house? - You're acting like you don't know.

1712
01:14:11,282 --> 01:14:13,512
We're not allowed to talk about it, are we?

1713
01:14:13,513 --> 01:14:15,112
I just asked if you had a phone call.

1714
01:14:15,452 --> 01:14:17,622
Yes, I did. I hope you're happy.

1715
01:14:18,822 --> 01:14:21,621
- I know. Thank you. - I hope both of us are happy.

1716
01:14:21,622 --> 01:14:23,062
- So did you do it? - Yes.

1717
01:14:23,423 --> 01:14:25,862
I also hope both of us are happy.

1718
01:14:26,562 --> 01:14:27,562
What do you mean?

1719
01:14:27,563 --> 01:14:29,262
Your happiness is my happiness.

1720
01:14:29,263 --> 01:14:32,231
I see. But it means we failed.

1721
01:14:32,232 --> 01:14:33,603
- No. - Then?

1722
01:14:33,872 --> 01:14:36,142
- You want me to be happy. - Yes.

1723
01:14:36,143 --> 01:14:37,972
And I want you to be happy.

1724
01:14:37,973 --> 01:14:39,271
Okay.

1725
01:14:39,272 --> 01:14:41,173
So it means what makes me happy makes both of us happy.

1726
01:14:41,812 --> 01:14:43,142
You guys are so funny.

1727
01:14:43,143 --> 01:14:45,411
This is ridiculous.

1728
01:14:45,412 --> 01:14:48,281
I can't believe she teases me so much like that.

1729
01:14:48,282 --> 01:14:50,083
- Did you hear what she said? - I did.

1730
01:14:50,482 --> 01:14:52,892
What is she talking about? What does it even mean?

1731
01:14:52,893 --> 01:14:54,853
It means my happiness is your happiness.

1732
01:14:55,353 --> 01:14:58,062
(He checks the result.)

1733
01:14:59,763 --> 01:15:02,361
Your sibling was given a chance to go on a date...

1734
01:15:02,362 --> 01:15:03,662
as you gave up.

1735
01:15:04,133 --> 01:15:06,633
Ju Yeon still has a long way to go to act like an older sister.

1736
01:15:06,933 --> 01:15:08,732
She still doesn't know his older brother always gives up...

1737
01:15:08,933 --> 01:15:10,473
when he should make a decision like this.

1738
01:15:12,843 --> 01:15:13,872
She still doesn't know.

1739
01:15:17,982 --> 01:15:21,912
(The spitting-image siblings are awkward somehow.)

1740
01:15:23,223 --> 01:15:25,952
You said you had plans in the evening.

1741
01:15:26,293 --> 01:15:28,353
Why do we keep speaking formally?

1742
01:15:28,452 --> 01:15:29,762
To keep our distance from each other.

1743
01:15:29,763 --> 01:15:30,763
- Okay. Let's carry on then. - Yes.

1744
01:15:30,764 --> 01:15:32,061
How would you like to eat jamon with melons?

1745
01:15:32,062 --> 01:15:33,062
Deliciously.

1746
01:15:33,062 --> 01:15:34,062
(Bursting into laughter)

1747
01:15:34,532 --> 01:15:36,662
- Flavorfully. - Flavorfully.

1748
01:15:36,763 --> 01:15:39,572
Se Seung and Jae Hyung are in the hideout, right?

1749
01:15:40,003 --> 01:15:41,003
They are?

1750
01:15:41,004 --> 01:15:42,502
I have a question.

1751
01:15:42,503 --> 01:15:44,941
If you can choose your next date,

1752
01:15:44,942 --> 01:15:45,972
who will you choose?

1753
01:15:45,973 --> 01:15:47,173
- My next date? - Yes.

1754
01:15:48,612 --> 01:15:51,513
I don't want to say anything about it.

1755
01:15:51,612 --> 01:15:53,452
What? Why not?

1756
01:15:53,952 --> 01:15:55,411
There's nothing to hide.

1757
01:15:55,412 --> 01:15:57,083
No matter who you choose, there's nothing weird about it.

1758
01:15:57,183 --> 01:15:58,723
I'm not sure.

1759
01:15:59,322 --> 01:16:00,821
You're not sure about anyone?

1760
01:16:00,822 --> 01:16:02,122
- No. - Okay.

1761
01:16:02,822 --> 01:16:04,362
It's harder than I thought.

1762
01:16:05,022 --> 01:16:06,161
I guess so.

1763
01:16:06,162 --> 01:16:08,062
But what about it? You can't help it.

1764
01:16:08,393 --> 01:16:10,401
Everything is tangled up...

1765
01:16:10,402 --> 01:16:11,632
- and complicated here. - I know.

1766
01:16:11,633 --> 01:16:13,901
The people I met here...

1767
01:16:13,902 --> 01:16:16,572
- are all precious to me. - That's what I'm saying.

1768
01:16:16,673 --> 01:16:18,842
If I just do that...

1769
01:16:18,843 --> 01:16:20,111
You can't choose someone...

1770
01:16:20,112 --> 01:16:22,241
- just because you have to. - Right.

1771
01:16:22,242 --> 01:16:23,311
You're good at talking.

1772
01:16:23,312 --> 01:16:25,583
- I know. - That's logical. I should use that.

1773
01:16:26,353 --> 01:16:27,781
I've always been good at talking.

1774
01:16:27,782 --> 01:16:29,312
- What about you? - Me?

1775
01:16:30,853 --> 01:16:31,922
I don't know.

1776
01:16:31,923 --> 01:16:34,451
Are you more confused now...

1777
01:16:34,452 --> 01:16:36,121
compared to when we spoke in the Sibling's Room?

1778
01:16:36,122 --> 01:16:39,222
When you told me to be cautious, it resonated with me.

1779
01:16:39,223 --> 01:16:40,861
But are you cautious...

1780
01:16:40,862 --> 01:16:43,763
because your feelings have become too deep?

1781
01:16:44,362 --> 01:16:47,872
Or because, now that you've thought about it,

1782
01:16:48,202 --> 01:16:50,042
you're like, "I don't think I even liked him that much."

1783
01:16:50,043 --> 01:16:52,973
"Was it curiosity?"

1784
01:16:53,372 --> 01:16:55,843
- I think it's both. - Okay. Think about it.

1785
01:16:57,043 --> 01:17:01,012
I was curious about where my sister's heart was at.

1786
01:17:01,013 --> 01:17:03,481
Since there was the issue...

1787
01:17:03,482 --> 01:17:07,191
where they didn't send messages to each other in Gangwon Province,

1788
01:17:07,192 --> 01:17:09,861
I felt like there was a shift,

1789
01:17:09,862 --> 01:17:12,062
like she was a bit confused.

1790
01:17:14,593 --> 01:17:16,031
- Jung Sub. - What?

1791
01:17:16,032 --> 01:17:17,162
- Where's Jung Sub? - Jae Hyung.

1792
01:17:17,833 --> 01:17:19,402
- Jae Hyung. - Jae Hyung.

1793
01:17:19,732 --> 01:17:21,332
He's calling your name.

1794
01:17:21,333 --> 01:17:22,702
I didn't hear him.

1795
01:17:26,312 --> 01:17:27,371
(It's a secret.)

1796
01:17:27,372 --> 01:17:28,411
(Go to the small room with the phone...)

1797
01:17:28,412 --> 01:17:29,481
(in the hideout.)

1798
01:17:29,482 --> 01:17:30,643
(Then, call this number.)

1799
01:17:42,822 --> 01:17:45,662
You'll be going on a date with Ju Yeon.

1800
01:17:45,763 --> 01:17:47,763
Number one, I'll go on a date.

1801
01:17:47,963 --> 01:17:50,603
Number two, my sister Se Seung will go on a date.

1802
01:17:54,732 --> 01:17:56,102
What Jae Hyung's about to choose is very important.

1803
01:17:56,103 --> 01:17:58,571
It would be nice if they get to go on a date.

1804
01:17:58,572 --> 01:18:00,642
Jae Hyung has to figure out how he feels too.

1805
01:18:00,643 --> 01:18:02,311
Everything is in Jae Hyung's hands.

1806
01:18:02,312 --> 01:18:04,182
- It is. He's the key. - That's Jae Hyung for you.

1807
01:18:04,183 --> 01:18:06,312
Everything is in his hands.

1808
01:18:08,853 --> 01:18:11,321
Ju Yeon's could have gone either way.

1809
01:18:11,322 --> 01:18:14,252
She seemed so close with Yong Woo.

1810
01:18:14,253 --> 01:18:17,191
So I thought it was obvious that she'd give...

1811
01:18:17,192 --> 01:18:18,821
the chance to her brother.

1812
01:18:18,822 --> 01:18:20,731
But when I think about Yong Woo's personality,

1813
01:18:20,732 --> 01:18:22,432
I feel like he would have given the chance to his sister.

1814
01:18:22,433 --> 01:18:23,802
And since Ju Yeon knows that,

1815
01:18:23,803 --> 01:18:25,701
she could have chosen number one.

1816
01:18:25,702 --> 01:18:27,702
"I hope Jae Hyung doesn't give it away..."

1817
01:18:27,973 --> 01:18:29,843
"and chooses the date."

1818
01:18:29,942 --> 01:18:31,942
That way, we. can go on a date.

1819
01:18:32,643 --> 01:18:36,312
(Jae Hyung has to press one to confirm his date with Ju Yeon.)

1820
01:18:38,683 --> 01:18:40,952
- Gosh. - Gosh. Why?

1821
01:18:42,612 --> 01:18:45,853
(Jae Hyung chose to give it away.)

1822
01:18:49,253 --> 01:18:52,393
Why do you want your sibling to go on a date?

1823
01:18:55,032 --> 01:18:58,861
I think she's thinking about it more cautiously right now.

1824
01:18:58,862 --> 01:19:00,701
So I think that if she goes on...

1825
01:19:00,702 --> 01:19:03,872
another date, she might understand...

1826
01:19:04,242 --> 01:19:05,372
how she feels a bit better.

1827
01:19:05,872 --> 01:19:08,311
If I chose one,

1828
01:19:08,312 --> 01:19:11,241
it would have seemed like I chose Ju Yeon.

1829
01:19:11,242 --> 01:19:13,411
But in that case,

1830
01:19:13,412 --> 01:19:15,951
I thought it would be possible for her to think that...

1831
01:19:15,952 --> 01:19:19,082
I was interested in her or that I had feelings for her.

1832
01:19:19,083 --> 01:19:20,951
But I'm not sure about my feelings.

1833
01:19:20,952 --> 01:19:23,423
That's why...

1834
01:19:24,062 --> 01:19:25,892
I wanted to avoid that situation.

1835
01:19:25,893 --> 01:19:27,933
Both of you chose number two,

1836
01:19:28,133 --> 01:19:30,933
that the siblings would go on the date.

1837
01:19:31,232 --> 01:19:33,272
You two have such a good relationship.

1838
01:19:33,532 --> 01:19:36,543
But neither one of you will be going on a date.

1839
01:19:36,902 --> 01:19:39,742
Hopefully, you get another chance next time.

1840
01:19:40,942 --> 01:19:43,842
I definitely thought Se Seung would press on number one...

1841
01:19:43,843 --> 01:19:45,981
because she knew how I would think.

1842
01:19:45,982 --> 01:19:49,111
I thought she would know that obviously...

1843
01:19:49,112 --> 01:19:51,552
I would choose number two.

1844
01:19:51,553 --> 01:19:53,951
She just simply focused on...

1845
01:19:53,952 --> 01:19:55,992
being considerate toward me.

1846
01:19:56,122 --> 01:19:58,662
She should have thought past that.

1847
01:19:58,862 --> 01:20:00,992
Why would she be considerate of me?

1848
01:20:01,232 --> 01:20:03,102
If my feelings were strong,

1849
01:20:03,103 --> 01:20:05,901
Se Seung would have definitely noticed.

1850
01:20:05,902 --> 01:20:09,231
Because I've always been obvious.

1851
01:20:09,232 --> 01:20:13,112
I feel like her consideration of me was unnecessary.

1852
01:20:23,223 --> 01:20:25,022
You two have such a good relationship.

1853
01:20:25,383 --> 01:20:28,492
But neither one of you will be going on a date.

1854
01:20:28,923 --> 01:20:30,092
I knew it.

1855
01:20:30,093 --> 01:20:32,321
Looking back, I feel like a fool.

1856
01:20:32,322 --> 01:20:35,362
Jae Hyung would 200 percent give it away.

1857
01:20:35,463 --> 01:20:37,133
I should have thought about it some more.

1858
01:20:40,772 --> 01:20:42,072
(Gosh)

1859
01:20:52,883 --> 01:20:55,013
Jae Hyung, how was work today?

1860
01:20:55,253 --> 01:20:56,253
What about you?

1861
01:20:56,322 --> 01:20:58,281
I was so sleepy, so I slept during lunch.

1862
01:20:58,282 --> 01:21:00,321
I had lunch plans.

1863
01:21:00,322 --> 01:21:01,353
With who?

1864
01:21:02,093 --> 01:21:03,793
- With my friends at work. - I see.

1865
01:21:03,992 --> 01:21:06,393
I thought we were going on a date today.

1866
01:21:07,593 --> 01:21:08,662
I see.

1867
01:21:09,232 --> 01:21:10,963
Do you own any red clothes?

1868
01:21:11,103 --> 01:21:12,862
- I have something orange. - Orange.

1869
01:21:14,173 --> 01:21:15,701
You have an orange one and a yellow one?

1870
01:21:15,702 --> 01:21:17,502
I have orange, and yellow, and green...

1871
01:21:17,503 --> 01:21:18,872
"And green."

1872
01:21:19,473 --> 01:21:22,942
I have emerald, and pink.

1873
01:21:23,112 --> 01:21:24,811
You look good in primary colours.

1874
01:21:24,812 --> 01:21:26,382
- I think I do. - Bright colours.

1875
01:21:26,383 --> 01:21:28,052
My heart hurts so badly.

1876
01:21:28,053 --> 01:21:30,651
Ju Yeon doesn't know that the date has been cancelled.

1877
01:21:30,652 --> 01:21:32,321
She looks kind of...

1878
01:21:32,322 --> 01:21:33,792
- excited about the date. - Right.

1879
01:21:33,793 --> 01:21:35,592
- She was so excited. - Right.

1880
01:21:35,593 --> 01:21:36,662
"What should I wear?"

1881
01:21:38,423 --> 01:21:41,433
(Meanwhile, Cheol Hyeon is here to choose again.)

1882
01:21:42,562 --> 01:21:44,303
This is your last chance.

1883
01:21:44,402 --> 01:21:46,901
If you make the same choice as your sibling again,

1884
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:48,603
both dates will be cancelled.

1885
01:21:50,372 --> 01:21:52,002
(He chose himself again.)

1886
01:21:52,003 --> 01:21:53,842
I thought that Cho A...

1887
01:21:53,843 --> 01:21:56,842
would give it away.

1888
01:21:56,843 --> 01:21:59,042
I haven't gotten much feedback from her.

1889
01:21:59,043 --> 01:22:01,182
I haven't heard for certain about...

1890
01:22:01,183 --> 01:22:03,582
whether it was Jung Sub or Yong Woo.

1891
01:22:03,583 --> 01:22:04,583
So I thought,

1892
01:22:04,584 --> 01:22:07,392
"I should go on this date. Cho A can take it easy."

1893
01:22:07,393 --> 01:22:09,393
Number one, I'll go on a date.

1894
01:22:09,593 --> 01:22:12,223
Number two, my brother Cheol Hyeon will go on a date.

1895
01:22:13,463 --> 01:22:14,832
(She chooses to give it away.)

1896
01:22:14,833 --> 01:22:17,532
"At least one of us should go."

1897
01:22:17,833 --> 01:22:20,173
(Do you think Cheol Hyeon would have pressed on number one again?)

1898
01:22:20,433 --> 01:22:21,473
Yes.

1899
01:22:24,043 --> 01:22:26,742
(Yun Ha and Yun Jae return home after their date.)

1900
01:22:27,312 --> 01:22:29,742
Someone's here.

1901
01:22:31,013 --> 01:22:32,911
Who is it?

1902
01:22:32,912 --> 01:22:34,252
Yun Ha

1903
01:22:34,253 --> 01:22:36,052
- Hello. - Gosh.

1904
01:22:36,053 --> 01:22:37,481
Yun Ha Haha.

1905
01:22:37,482 --> 01:22:38,622
- Did you have fun? - Haha.

1906
01:22:38,753 --> 01:22:40,621
- Are you back from work? - Yes. Aren't you tired?

1907
01:22:40,622 --> 01:22:42,691
No, I'm all right. I slept in today.

1908
01:22:42,692 --> 01:22:43,822
You two are wearing matching outfits.

1909
01:22:43,992 --> 01:22:46,062
- Coincidentally. - Coincidentally.

1910
01:22:47,593 --> 01:22:48,662
Yes.

1911
01:22:48,963 --> 01:22:51,062
You look especially alike today.

1912
01:22:51,133 --> 01:22:52,201
- Today. - You look especially alike today.

1913
01:22:52,202 --> 01:22:53,571
Yong Woo.

1914
01:22:53,572 --> 01:22:56,742
- Gosh, what do I do? - Yong Woo, your hair is so long.

1915
01:23:00,673 --> 01:23:01,771
(It's a secret.)

1916
01:23:01,772 --> 01:23:02,772
(Go to the small room with the phone in the hideout.)

1917
01:23:02,773 --> 01:23:03,812
(Then, call this number.)

1918
01:23:04,912 --> 01:23:07,651
When I first got that message,

1919
01:23:07,652 --> 01:23:08,912
I got so nervous.

1920
01:23:09,312 --> 01:23:10,322
Again?

1921
01:23:13,192 --> 01:23:14,223
Nervous Yun Jae.

1922
01:23:19,593 --> 01:23:21,433
(His first time in the small room in the basement.)

1923
01:23:25,662 --> 01:23:28,402
You'll be going on a date with Yun Ha.

1924
01:23:28,673 --> 01:23:31,942
But only one sibling can go on a date.

1925
01:23:32,143 --> 01:23:34,412
"I have a problem. What should I do?"

1926
01:23:34,543 --> 01:23:36,513
Number one, I'll go on a date.

1927
01:23:36,713 --> 01:23:39,343
Number two, my sister Ji Won will go on a date.

1928
01:23:39,883 --> 01:23:41,012
Repeat the message.

1929
01:23:41,013 --> 01:23:43,651
I didn't understand, so I kept repeating it five times.

1930
01:23:43,652 --> 01:23:44,753
Repeat the message.

1931
01:23:44,853 --> 01:23:46,753
Gosh, what should I do?

1932
01:23:48,253 --> 01:23:49,492
(He's trembling.)

1933
01:23:49,622 --> 01:23:51,522
Number one, I'll go on a date.

1934
01:23:51,862 --> 01:23:54,333
Number two, my sister Ji Won will go on a date.

1935
01:23:57,463 --> 01:23:59,702
(If he chooses number 2, neither of them will be going on a date.)

1936
01:24:02,232 --> 01:24:05,702
(The fate of his date is at the tip of this hand.)

1937
01:24:09,772 --> 01:24:10,811
- Right. - Yes.

1938
01:24:10,812 --> 01:24:11,842
Nice.

1939
01:24:11,843 --> 01:24:13,282
- He hasn't had much time. - Nice.

1940
01:24:13,812 --> 01:24:15,451
(He chose to go on a date.)

1941
01:24:15,452 --> 01:24:18,553
Why do you want to go on a date?

1942
01:24:19,282 --> 01:24:20,492
This isn't over?

1943
01:24:21,122 --> 01:24:22,522
I want to get to know her better.

1944
01:24:23,492 --> 01:24:26,021
Your sibling gave it to you.

1945
01:24:26,022 --> 01:24:28,562
I was 200 percent sure that Ji Won would have pressed number two.

1946
01:24:28,732 --> 01:24:30,561
In situations like this, Ji Won is...

1947
01:24:30,562 --> 01:24:32,361
someone who would always give it away.

1948
01:24:32,362 --> 01:24:33,472
Thanks, Ji Won.

1949
01:24:33,473 --> 01:24:34,832
I should go first.

1950
01:24:34,833 --> 01:24:36,701
You have a great sister.

1951
01:24:36,702 --> 01:24:38,973
That's true. So I said, "Yes."

1952
01:24:40,643 --> 01:24:42,143
I knew it.

1953
01:24:42,973 --> 01:24:44,683
I knew Kim Ji Won would do it.

1954
01:24:47,383 --> 01:24:50,252
Your brother Yun Jae chose number one,

1955
01:24:50,253 --> 01:24:51,582
"I'll go on a date."

1956
01:24:51,583 --> 01:24:53,052
Because you gave it away,

1957
01:24:53,053 --> 01:24:55,353
your sibling was given the chance to go on a date.

1958
01:25:02,192 --> 01:25:03,502
Funny.

1959
01:25:03,503 --> 01:25:05,202
How selfish of him.

1960
01:25:06,503 --> 01:25:08,603
(Her selfish brother happens to walk past her.)

1961
01:25:09,532 --> 01:25:11,103
(Walking on eggshells)

1962
01:25:13,412 --> 01:25:16,312
(Yun Ha is here to choose too.)

1963
01:25:19,713 --> 01:25:21,652
Number one, I'll go on a date.

1964
01:25:21,982 --> 01:25:24,683
Number two, my brother Jung Sub will go on a date.

1965
01:25:24,952 --> 01:25:27,151
If both siblings choose to give it away,

1966
01:25:27,152 --> 01:25:29,452
neither of you will go on a date.

1967
01:25:37,202 --> 01:25:39,602
I wasn't even conflicted. I just chose...

1968
01:25:39,603 --> 01:25:41,973
number one, that I'll go on a date.

1969
01:25:42,503 --> 01:25:45,172
Because after going on the first date,

1970
01:25:45,173 --> 01:25:47,042
I felt good about it.

1971
01:25:47,043 --> 01:25:49,212
So I had a strong feeling...

1972
01:25:49,213 --> 01:25:50,883
that I should do it again. So...

1973
01:25:50,942 --> 01:25:53,912
Why do you want to go on a date?

1974
01:25:56,723 --> 01:25:59,583
Because my sibling has been on lots of them.

1975
01:26:00,452 --> 01:26:01,951
- I agree. - Right.

1976
01:26:01,952 --> 01:26:03,222
- "Now it's my turn." - She's right.

1977
01:26:03,223 --> 01:26:04,622
You've been on lots of them,

1978
01:26:05,992 --> 01:26:07,491
so you should give it away to me.

1979
01:26:07,492 --> 01:26:10,062
(Which number do you think your brother chose?)

1980
01:26:10,263 --> 01:26:12,061
I thought he would have chosen the same as me.

1981
01:26:12,062 --> 01:26:14,371
To be honest, Yun Ha isn't the type to give things away to me.

1982
01:26:14,372 --> 01:26:15,372
I think she would have chosen number one.

1983
01:26:15,373 --> 01:26:19,003
Both siblings chose number one, "I'll go on a date."

1984
01:26:19,103 --> 01:26:21,043
What an impossible pair of siblings.

1985
01:26:21,473 --> 01:26:23,412
What an impossible pair of siblings.

1986
01:26:23,843 --> 01:26:25,683
This is your last chance.

1987
01:26:25,912 --> 01:26:28,411
If you make the same choice as your sibling again,

1988
01:26:28,412 --> 01:26:30,322
both dates will be cancelled.

1989
01:26:30,423 --> 01:26:32,423
Number one, I'll go on a date.

1990
01:26:32,522 --> 01:26:34,822
Number two, my sister Yun Ha will go on a date.

1991
01:26:39,293 --> 01:26:40,593
If it were Yun Ha...

1992
01:26:42,133 --> 01:26:43,662
she would go with what she wants without a doubt.

1993
01:26:45,402 --> 01:26:47,003
Even if she ends up not going, she'd still choose it.

1994
01:26:51,973 --> 01:26:53,612
She would go with what she wants.

1995
01:26:55,312 --> 01:26:56,683
At least one of us should go.

1996
01:26:56,982 --> 01:26:58,583
I think Yun Ha chose number one.

1997
01:26:59,242 --> 01:27:01,111
(He chose number 2, giving it away.)

1998
01:27:01,112 --> 01:27:03,583
Yun Ha goes for what she wants even if she ends up not getting it.

1999
01:27:09,192 --> 01:27:10,662
(He plays it cool for now.)

2000
01:27:12,662 --> 01:27:15,492
(Yun Ha has to go and choose again.)

2001
01:27:17,463 --> 01:27:18,463
(Laughing)

2002
01:27:28,372 --> 01:27:30,083
This is your last chance.

2003
01:27:30,183 --> 01:27:32,411
Number one, I'll go on a date.

2004
01:27:32,412 --> 01:27:35,053
Number two, my brother Jung Sub will go on a date.

2005
01:27:36,183 --> 01:27:37,321
(Persistence)

2006
01:27:37,322 --> 01:27:39,452
Yun Ha goes for what she wants even if she ends up not getting it.

2007
01:27:40,322 --> 01:27:41,893
- Gosh. Without any hesitation. - Nice.

2008
01:27:42,253 --> 01:27:43,821
Then Yun Ha and Yun Jae will be going out on a date.

2009
01:27:43,822 --> 01:27:45,262
- They'll be going out on a date. - Okay.

2010
01:27:45,263 --> 01:27:47,692
Your sibling gave up his date for you.

2011
01:27:48,192 --> 01:27:49,892
You have a great brother.

2012
01:27:49,893 --> 01:27:53,933
The way Jung Sub looks out for his older sister...

2013
01:27:54,032 --> 01:27:57,043
I think he's a much better person than I am.

2014
01:27:57,402 --> 01:27:59,942
I was thankful and proud.

2015
01:28:00,143 --> 01:28:01,543
That's my brother.

2016
01:28:02,213 --> 01:28:06,643
Yun Ha chose number one, "I'll go on a date."

2017
01:28:07,053 --> 01:28:10,781
Because you gave up, your sibling can go out on a date.

2018
01:28:10,782 --> 01:28:12,022
Do well.

2019
01:28:14,622 --> 01:28:15,992
I knew it.

2020
01:28:16,963 --> 01:28:18,223
I'm smooth with it.

2021
01:28:25,263 --> 01:28:27,003
What's wrong with her?

2022
01:28:27,133 --> 01:28:28,303
What's wrong?

2023
01:28:34,742 --> 01:28:35,871
Did something happen yesterday?

2024
01:28:35,872 --> 01:28:37,482
Yesterday, with Jung Sub.

2025
01:28:37,643 --> 01:28:39,781
It's not that anything happened.

2026
01:28:39,782 --> 01:28:41,652
So then did you have a good time with him?

2027
01:28:41,853 --> 01:28:44,621
I did. He was very considerate,

2028
01:28:44,622 --> 01:28:46,683
and he took care of me.

2029
01:28:46,853 --> 01:28:48,691
I had a lot to drink,

2030
01:28:48,692 --> 01:28:50,491
and when we got to the cabin, I was so sleepy.

2031
01:28:50,492 --> 01:28:52,361
- And tired? - And tired.

2032
01:28:52,362 --> 01:28:56,332
Jung Sub initially said he wanted to talk.

2033
01:28:56,333 --> 01:28:58,232
It's like they're in the Sibling's Room over there.

2034
01:29:00,673 --> 01:29:03,133
At first, I liked Jung Sub, but...

2035
01:29:03,303 --> 01:29:04,643
How should I put this?

2036
01:29:05,843 --> 01:29:09,242
I feel like he's moving a bit too fast.

2037
01:29:09,612 --> 01:29:13,241
I think he's very interested in you.

2038
01:29:13,242 --> 01:29:14,911
So I think he'll treat you well.

2039
01:29:14,912 --> 01:29:16,951
But that's also why...

2040
01:29:16,952 --> 01:29:19,621
you feel like he's moving fast.

2041
01:29:19,622 --> 01:29:21,752
- He wants to know how you feel. - I think you're right.

2042
01:29:21,753 --> 01:29:22,753
Right.

2043
01:29:22,754 --> 01:29:25,121
Cho A told me Jung Sub wanted to know...

2044
01:29:25,122 --> 01:29:26,892
how she felt about him,

2045
01:29:26,893 --> 01:29:30,332
and that it made her uncomfortable.

2046
01:29:30,333 --> 01:29:33,102
Maybe he wanted her to like him back...

2047
01:29:33,103 --> 01:29:34,103
and wanted to know how she felt.

2048
01:29:34,104 --> 01:29:35,432
I understand that Cho A was uncomfortable with that,

2049
01:29:35,433 --> 01:29:39,201
but, in a way, he's behaving like that...

2050
01:29:39,202 --> 01:29:41,143
because he likes her.

2051
01:29:41,343 --> 01:29:44,013
That could be a good thing.

2052
01:29:44,282 --> 01:29:47,182
When you went out on a date with Yong Woo,

2053
01:29:47,183 --> 01:29:49,112
you didn't see a different side of him, yet, right?

2054
01:29:49,482 --> 01:29:52,022
Right. But I think he feels...

2055
01:29:52,853 --> 01:29:54,392
more manly to me.

2056
01:29:54,393 --> 01:29:56,422
- Yong Woo feels more dependable. - Yes. I...

2057
01:29:56,423 --> 01:29:58,321
feel more assured around him.

2058
01:29:58,322 --> 01:30:00,191
So I like him. But...

2059
01:30:00,192 --> 01:30:04,503
he still seems hesitant about...

2060
01:30:04,732 --> 01:30:08,032
openly talking about me in that way.

2061
01:30:08,173 --> 01:30:09,503
Anyway, look into it.

2062
01:30:09,902 --> 01:30:11,371
Is there anything else you want to talk about?

2063
01:30:11,372 --> 01:30:12,942
I'll let you know if I think of anything.

2064
01:30:13,442 --> 01:30:14,973
- All right. Let's go over there. - Okay.

2065
01:30:17,442 --> 01:30:19,742
- Is the Sibling's Room over? - Yes, it's over.

2066
01:30:22,312 --> 01:30:23,651
What's that?

2067
01:30:23,652 --> 01:30:25,782
Yun Jae. Yun Jae should go.

2068
01:30:32,423 --> 01:30:33,423
It's here.

2069
01:30:38,062 --> 01:30:39,502
- Read it for us. - Read it for us.

2070
01:30:39,503 --> 01:30:40,732
I'm not good at reading.

2071
01:30:42,272 --> 01:30:44,543
(Yun Jae, who isn't good at reading, opened the envelope.)

2072
01:30:46,503 --> 01:30:48,411
"The couple to go out on a date has been finalized through..."

2073
01:30:48,412 --> 01:30:50,013
"the choice you made today over the phone."

2074
01:30:51,412 --> 01:30:52,682
Lee Yun Ha, Kim Yun Jae.

2075
01:30:52,683 --> 01:30:54,852
You may talk about today's date decision...

2076
01:30:54,853 --> 01:30:56,853
freely, starting now.

2077
01:30:58,522 --> 01:31:00,793
- So then only 1... - Only 1 team made it?

2078
01:31:02,822 --> 01:31:04,322
- That's what it says. - Really?

2079
01:31:04,723 --> 01:31:06,691
How many teams were there...

2080
01:31:06,692 --> 01:31:08,263
- in total? - At least five.

2081
01:31:08,532 --> 01:31:10,032
We've always had five teams.

2082
01:31:10,803 --> 01:31:13,902
Wait, this is it? This one pair?

2083
01:31:14,072 --> 01:31:15,133
That one pair.

2084
01:31:15,902 --> 01:31:18,472
- Really? - This is the only pair?

2085
01:31:18,473 --> 01:31:19,742
You guys...

2086
01:31:20,612 --> 01:31:21,972
It was so funny.

2087
01:31:21,973 --> 01:31:23,441
All the other couples were gone,

2088
01:31:23,442 --> 01:31:26,411
but it had "Kim Yun Jae" written on it.

2089
01:31:26,412 --> 01:31:27,883
Gosh.

2090
01:31:30,423 --> 01:31:31,451
It was funny.

2091
01:31:31,452 --> 01:31:34,121
And the ones who were finalized...

2092
01:31:34,122 --> 01:31:38,061
had a strong will to go on a date,

2093
01:31:38,062 --> 01:31:39,963
so they chose their own dates.

2094
01:31:40,122 --> 01:31:42,132
To be honest, I was very glad.

2095
01:31:42,133 --> 01:31:46,162
I could tell I wasn't the only one who enjoyed our date,

2096
01:31:46,633 --> 01:31:47,702
so I felt very relieved.

2097
01:31:47,833 --> 01:31:50,232
How could this happen?

2098
01:31:50,603 --> 01:31:52,142
- How many times did she choose... - Right.

2099
01:31:52,143 --> 01:31:53,271
just so she could go out with him?

2100
01:31:53,272 --> 01:31:54,712
- She chose twice. - That's right.

2101
01:31:54,713 --> 01:31:56,212
They would have to be in sync during all of those times.

2102
01:31:56,213 --> 01:31:58,412
- She pushed her sibling aside. - Right.

2103
01:32:00,043 --> 01:32:02,012
I read it out loud. Why would you look at it?

2104
01:32:02,013 --> 01:32:03,253
Put it down.

2105
01:32:03,753 --> 01:32:04,822
Quiet.

2106
01:32:05,923 --> 01:32:07,951
- How charismatic. - You heard that, right?

2107
01:32:07,952 --> 01:32:11,361
"You two have such a good relationship."

2108
01:32:11,362 --> 01:32:13,661
It wasn't "good relationship" for me.

2109
01:32:13,662 --> 01:32:14,932
It said "What an impossible pair of siblings."

2110
01:32:14,933 --> 01:32:15,933
Me too.

2111
01:32:15,934 --> 01:32:18,062
"What an impossible pair of siblings."

2112
01:32:19,603 --> 01:32:20,901
I can tell what kind of situation it was.

2113
01:32:20,902 --> 01:32:23,973
- That's what... - We both chose the same number.

2114
01:32:24,143 --> 01:32:26,143
- We both chose number 1. - We both chose number 1.

2115
01:32:26,242 --> 01:32:27,811
I was like, "Yun Ha..."

2116
01:32:27,812 --> 01:32:30,542
He said he pressed on number one at first.

2117
01:32:30,543 --> 01:32:33,182
I was thankful.

2118
01:32:33,183 --> 01:32:36,782
"It's not that he doesn't want to go on a date with me."

2119
01:32:37,282 --> 01:32:38,683
I felt slightly relieved.

2120
01:32:38,982 --> 01:32:40,992
Which pair of siblings both gave up?

2121
01:32:41,553 --> 01:32:42,692
- Both gave up? - Us.

2122
01:32:43,223 --> 01:32:44,991
Both of you gave up?

2123
01:32:44,992 --> 01:32:46,462
She said she chose number two.

2124
01:32:46,463 --> 01:32:47,532
"Does she..."

2125
01:32:48,263 --> 01:32:49,833
"not want to go out on a date?"

2126
01:32:50,463 --> 01:32:52,132
What do you mean by both?

2127
01:32:52,133 --> 01:32:53,731
I only got one phone call.

2128
01:32:53,732 --> 01:32:56,701
- Both siblings. - Siblings, not phone calls.

2129
01:32:56,702 --> 01:32:59,002
- Both of you chose number 2? - Number 2.

2130
01:32:59,003 --> 01:33:01,811
Since both of you gave up, you were done with one round.

2131
01:33:01,812 --> 01:33:03,643
That's great.

2132
01:33:03,812 --> 01:33:05,242
I didn't give up, though.

2133
01:33:05,383 --> 01:33:07,282
I chose to go out on a date.

2134
01:33:07,412 --> 01:33:09,812
It must be because Jae Hyung gave up...

2135
01:33:10,053 --> 01:33:12,822
Right. Because the other person gave up.

2136
01:33:13,452 --> 01:33:15,853
That means she really wanted to go out on a date with me,

2137
01:33:16,093 --> 01:33:19,521
so she could be very disappointed because she can't.

2138
01:33:19,522 --> 01:33:20,593
I was very disappointed.

2139
01:33:20,963 --> 01:33:23,802
I thought we'd be able to go out on a date.

2140
01:33:23,803 --> 01:33:25,232
I thought Jae Hyung would...

2141
01:33:26,362 --> 01:33:29,103
choose the date for himself too.

2142
01:33:30,702 --> 01:33:31,973
But he didn't.

2143
01:33:32,843 --> 01:33:34,571
I really wanted to go out on a date.

2144
01:33:34,572 --> 01:33:36,713
It was our chance to spend a whole day together out on a date.

2145
01:33:37,083 --> 01:33:40,611
And I did have that feeling.

2146
01:33:40,612 --> 01:33:43,781
We went out on a date, went for a walk, and I sent her a message.

2147
01:33:43,782 --> 01:33:45,053
But the way I feel actually...

2148
01:33:46,152 --> 01:33:48,451
isn't like that...

2149
01:33:48,452 --> 01:33:51,191
I thought that if she found out...

2150
01:33:51,192 --> 01:33:54,362
I was still confused, she'd be upset.

2151
01:33:54,963 --> 01:33:59,262
I thought I'd be totally fine.

2152
01:33:59,263 --> 01:34:00,731
So then everyone...

2153
01:34:00,732 --> 01:34:02,603
Everyone gave up.

2154
01:34:03,843 --> 01:34:04,872
Gosh. You guys.

2155
01:34:05,843 --> 01:34:07,742
I did catch myself sighing.

2156
01:34:10,812 --> 01:34:12,142
I was a little disappointed.

2157
01:34:12,143 --> 01:34:14,151
But there are going to be other opportunities.

2158
01:34:14,152 --> 01:34:16,712
Next time, we'll be able to spend time together...

2159
01:34:16,713 --> 01:34:18,152
doing something fun.

2160
01:34:22,793 --> 01:34:25,621
- Did you call? Did you get a call? - Yes.

2161
01:34:25,622 --> 01:34:27,161
I did. I said he should go.

2162
01:34:27,162 --> 01:34:29,092
I couldn't understand, so I repeated it three times.

2163
01:34:29,093 --> 01:34:30,662
You didn't understand it?

2164
01:34:31,732 --> 01:34:33,901
I wasn't sure what it was saying.

2165
01:34:33,902 --> 01:34:35,472
Welcome to the club.

2166
01:34:35,473 --> 01:34:38,002
I mean, the beginning of it was so long.

2167
01:34:38,003 --> 01:34:39,772
Let's just have a drink. Sounds good.

2168
01:34:40,912 --> 01:34:42,941
I was worried that he might have given up,

2169
01:34:42,942 --> 01:34:44,111
but I was worried for no reason.

2170
01:34:44,112 --> 01:34:46,213
Of course I should do it. I should be the first one to go.

2171
01:34:46,942 --> 01:34:50,281
- This girl. Ridiculous. - So on my way upstairs,

2172
01:34:50,282 --> 01:34:51,883
I was like "How selfish of him."

2173
01:34:52,353 --> 01:34:53,923
As I was walking back upstairs.

2174
01:34:57,093 --> 01:34:58,093
(What?)

2175
01:34:59,223 --> 01:35:01,833
- It changed. - Something's been added.

2176
01:35:09,133 --> 01:35:11,143
"None" was an option.

2177
01:35:11,702 --> 01:35:13,972
(On the 10th day,)

2178
01:35:13,973 --> 01:35:16,642
(who made your heart flutter?)

2179
01:35:16,643 --> 01:35:18,543
(You can choose "None.")

2180
01:35:19,183 --> 01:35:21,513
- None. - Gosh. None.

2181
01:35:22,683 --> 01:35:24,353
"None" is actually...

2182
01:35:24,383 --> 01:35:26,583
- There should be that option. - Sometimes, it's needed.

2183
01:35:27,553 --> 01:35:31,293
(For the first time, they have an option of answering "None.")

2184
01:35:36,692 --> 01:35:38,232
Until then,

2185
01:35:38,333 --> 01:35:41,103
I have been sending a message to Ju Yeon.

2186
01:35:42,673 --> 01:35:44,472
From the start, I was pressured...

2187
01:35:44,473 --> 01:35:46,772
into making a choice.

2188
01:35:48,343 --> 01:35:50,583
To be honest, nothing made my heart flutter.

2189
01:35:50,683 --> 01:35:52,583
We didn't go on a date.

2190
01:35:53,083 --> 01:35:55,912
But I had this thought while working.

2191
01:35:56,683 --> 01:36:00,622
I think I missed Jae Hyung throughout the day.

2192
01:36:02,152 --> 01:36:05,222
When I entered the house and saw Jae Hyung's face,

2193
01:36:05,223 --> 01:36:06,393
it was really nice.

2194
01:36:06,492 --> 01:36:08,393
He looked like this.

2195
01:36:10,062 --> 01:36:12,361
He and I had a good time at Gangwon Province.

2196
01:36:12,362 --> 01:36:14,072
We like each other.

2197
01:36:16,232 --> 01:36:17,542
Is it like that?

2198
01:36:17,543 --> 01:36:19,571
(It's too bad that we couldn't go on a date.)

2199
01:36:19,572 --> 01:36:20,611
It's tasty, right?

2200
01:36:20,612 --> 01:36:22,643
- It's so tasty. - It's so tasty, right?

2201
01:36:23,112 --> 01:36:24,642
- Oh, no. - Oh, no.

2202
01:36:24,643 --> 01:36:27,853
Ju Yeon thinks she and Jae Hyung like each other.

2203
01:36:27,952 --> 01:36:29,611
- She can't help but feel that way. - She can't help but feel that way.

2204
01:36:29,612 --> 01:36:31,451
- Because they exchanged messages? - Yes.

2205
01:36:31,452 --> 01:36:34,452
- There was meat inside. - I know.

2206
01:36:34,923 --> 01:36:36,053
It was the best.

2207
01:36:36,152 --> 01:36:39,361
I wanted to express that I was disappointed about...

2208
01:36:39,362 --> 01:36:40,732
not going on a date.

2209
01:36:41,133 --> 01:36:42,463
I had expected it.

2210
01:36:43,662 --> 01:36:47,372
But it was a situation I wanted to avoid.

2211
01:36:47,673 --> 01:36:48,803
I felt bad.

2212
01:36:50,402 --> 01:36:52,643
I chose "None."

2213
01:36:52,742 --> 01:36:54,441
I waited for it.

2214
01:36:54,442 --> 01:36:55,612
I see.

2215
01:36:56,513 --> 01:36:57,542
Nice.

2216
01:36:57,543 --> 01:37:00,343
(No one chose your sibling.)

2217
01:37:02,282 --> 01:37:04,223
It can be like that.

2218
01:37:10,253 --> 01:37:12,621
He is dumbfounded. He is a bit angry.

2219
01:37:12,622 --> 01:37:14,492
He is like, "I can't believe Jae Hyung."

2220
01:37:14,593 --> 01:37:15,762
An older brother could feel that way.

2221
01:37:15,763 --> 01:37:16,792
- Yes. - He could feel that way.

2222
01:37:16,793 --> 01:37:18,701
He is like, "What's going on?"

2223
01:37:18,702 --> 01:37:19,732
Jae Hyung.

2224
01:37:31,782 --> 01:37:32,842
Just one.

2225
01:37:32,843 --> 01:37:35,651
(Cho A chose your sibling.)

2226
01:37:35,652 --> 01:37:37,383
Do you order it?

2227
01:37:37,522 --> 01:37:39,222
It seems like my brother and Cho A...

2228
01:37:39,223 --> 01:37:41,952
- message each other every day. - It would be nice to go there.

2229
01:37:42,192 --> 01:37:44,322
"I want our relationship to be that solid."

2230
01:37:44,763 --> 01:37:46,322
"I am jealous." I had that thought.

2231
01:37:48,162 --> 01:37:49,393
I felt quite unhappy.

2232
01:37:49,933 --> 01:37:54,133
I felt like my heart dropped to the floor.

2233
01:37:55,173 --> 01:37:57,002
She liked him a lot.

2234
01:37:57,003 --> 01:37:58,571
- She really liked him. - She thought...

2235
01:37:58,572 --> 01:37:59,572
they liked each other.

2236
01:37:59,573 --> 01:38:02,742
Perhaps Jae Hyung yielded...

2237
01:38:03,043 --> 01:38:04,883
because he didn't need to go...

2238
01:38:04,982 --> 01:38:07,353
on a date.

2239
01:38:08,482 --> 01:38:10,452
Perhaps he had a change of heart.

2240
01:38:11,353 --> 01:38:12,723
When we know our schedule,

2241
01:38:13,652 --> 01:38:15,322
we can do that.

2242
01:38:15,793 --> 01:38:18,491
(It was nice to ride the same car yesterday.)

2243
01:38:18,492 --> 01:38:20,793
(I wanted to talk more during the date, so it's too bad.)

2244
01:38:22,992 --> 01:38:24,633
It seems like...

2245
01:38:24,732 --> 01:38:26,803
I wasn't the only one who was disappointed.

2246
01:38:28,072 --> 01:38:29,833
Each one of those messages...

2247
01:38:30,133 --> 01:38:32,543
gives me warmth.

2248
01:38:33,173 --> 01:38:35,012
I definitely got...

2249
01:38:35,013 --> 01:38:37,941
the message that Cho A wanted us to spend time...

2250
01:38:37,942 --> 01:38:39,683
by ourselves.

2251
01:38:40,412 --> 01:38:42,052
I was really disappointed.

2252
01:38:42,053 --> 01:38:44,822
I looked forward to the date.

2253
01:38:45,152 --> 01:38:47,053
These days, I haven't cooked a lot.

2254
01:38:48,793 --> 01:38:51,292
I didn't cook other things. I just cooked at the restaurant.

2255
01:38:51,293 --> 01:38:52,462
(We picked the same number. You did well today. Good night.)

2256
01:38:52,463 --> 01:38:54,062
Isn't it harder to cook at the restaurant?

2257
01:38:54,433 --> 01:38:57,833
Both Cho A and I yielded to our younger siblings.

2258
01:38:57,933 --> 01:38:59,333
That was my understanding.

2259
01:38:59,433 --> 01:39:02,003
(Cho A might have picked 1.)

2260
01:39:02,303 --> 01:39:03,902
That's right.

2261
01:39:04,303 --> 01:39:06,272
Cho A might have picked me.

2262
01:39:07,143 --> 01:39:08,942
You are right. It seems like...

2263
01:39:10,143 --> 01:39:11,742
I sent an assumptive message...

2264
01:39:12,043 --> 01:39:13,643
due to my lack of understanding.

2265
01:39:17,383 --> 01:39:18,981
It's fun to do that.

2266
01:39:18,982 --> 01:39:21,253
- You should try visiting. - I haven't done that yet.

2267
01:39:23,923 --> 01:39:27,793
(You are a charming person.)

2268
01:39:32,162 --> 01:39:34,333
He finds me charming.

2269
01:39:37,603 --> 01:39:38,772
It felt good.

2270
01:39:43,043 --> 01:39:46,683
(Please be nervous next time as well.)

2271
01:39:48,013 --> 01:39:49,852
"Please be nervous next time as well."

2272
01:39:49,853 --> 01:39:51,253
"Please be nervous."

2273
01:39:51,423 --> 01:39:53,883
I would show up with an electrical wire.

2274
01:39:55,122 --> 01:39:59,022
(Please be nervous next time as well.)

2275
01:40:05,303 --> 01:40:07,531
Perhaps Yun Ha found it cute...

2276
01:40:07,532 --> 01:40:09,702
that a grown-up man was...

2277
01:40:10,772 --> 01:40:11,803
still very nervous.

2278
01:40:12,503 --> 01:40:15,013
I really think I will get nervous again.

2279
01:40:15,812 --> 01:40:19,142
He was cute when he was nervous.

2280
01:40:19,143 --> 01:40:20,543
It was fun.

2281
01:40:24,183 --> 01:40:27,793
(The two of them built a connection over today's date.)

2282
01:40:28,322 --> 01:40:32,062
(Yun Jae chose your sibling.)

2283
01:40:32,393 --> 01:40:33,692
What's wrong with you?

2284
01:40:34,492 --> 01:40:36,991
(Yun Ha chose your sibling.)

2285
01:40:36,992 --> 01:40:39,103
- I can't see it. - I see.

2286
01:40:46,173 --> 01:40:49,741
(Let's enjoy the remainder of our time.)

2287
01:40:49,742 --> 01:40:53,312
I think it's Cheol Hyeon.

2288
01:40:53,782 --> 01:40:55,651
I couldn't have the second date with her,

2289
01:40:55,652 --> 01:40:56,812
so I was determined to have it.

2290
01:40:57,253 --> 01:40:58,622
With that thought,

2291
01:40:58,723 --> 01:41:01,923
I sent Ji Won a message.

2292
01:41:06,122 --> 01:41:07,162
When did you wake up?

2293
01:41:07,263 --> 01:41:09,393
- I woke up at 5pm. - At 5pm?

2294
01:41:09,732 --> 01:41:11,133
- When did you wake up? - I woke up at 4pm.

2295
01:41:11,732 --> 01:41:13,202
Why did you laugh when you were the same?

2296
01:41:14,772 --> 01:41:17,202
You laughed at me.

2297
01:41:17,303 --> 01:41:18,402
It wasn't like that.

2298
01:41:20,242 --> 01:41:22,312
She seemed calm.

2299
01:41:24,782 --> 01:41:26,183
It wasn't like Se Seung.

2300
01:41:27,912 --> 01:41:29,053
I wondered what the problem was.

2301
01:41:30,053 --> 01:41:31,482
She seemed to be in a bad condition.

2302
01:41:31,583 --> 01:41:34,053
She was quiet and still.

2303
01:41:35,093 --> 01:41:36,792
Perhaps she was like that...

2304
01:41:36,793 --> 01:41:39,463
because she knew that Ji Won and I drank together...

2305
01:41:39,562 --> 01:41:41,593
for a very long time.

2306
01:41:43,562 --> 01:41:46,062
I didn't even know what the situation was,

2307
01:41:46,263 --> 01:41:47,332
so I was more frustrated.

2308
01:41:47,333 --> 01:41:50,571
I wanted to decide if I had the right...

2309
01:41:50,572 --> 01:41:51,803
to be disappointed.

2310
01:41:53,043 --> 01:41:54,312
But I didn't know.

2311
01:41:54,412 --> 01:41:57,612
I didn't know what he was thinking.

2312
01:42:00,383 --> 01:42:03,282
(To whom did Jung Sub send a message today?)

2313
01:42:03,513 --> 01:42:04,753
- Jung Sub. - Finally.

2314
01:42:05,253 --> 01:42:07,253
- Jung Sub. - It's the highlight of the day.

2315
01:42:07,553 --> 01:42:08,621
Did you do it?

2316
01:42:08,622 --> 01:42:10,352
I was hesitant.

2317
01:42:10,353 --> 01:42:11,793
- Together. - I see.

2318
01:42:12,562 --> 01:42:13,792
It was the same.

2319
01:42:13,793 --> 01:42:15,361
(You were really good at playing the piano.)

2320
01:42:15,362 --> 01:42:16,932
(You must have been exhausted, so thank you for staying with me.)

2321
01:42:16,933 --> 01:42:18,633
(It will be fun to go on a double date!)

2322
01:42:21,532 --> 01:42:23,802
"You must have been exhausted, so thank you for staying with me."

2323
01:42:23,803 --> 01:42:25,842
- "It will be fun to go on..." - Jung Sub!

2324
01:42:25,843 --> 01:42:27,642
I really didn't know he would do that.

2325
01:42:27,643 --> 01:42:28,643
None of us knew.

2326
01:42:28,644 --> 01:42:30,441
I didn't know that he would send a text.

2327
01:42:30,442 --> 01:42:32,781
What is Se Seung going to do?

2328
01:42:32,782 --> 01:42:34,812
What will be Ji Won's choice?

2329
01:42:35,013 --> 01:42:36,311
(You were really good at playing the piano.)

2330
01:42:36,312 --> 01:42:37,651
(You must have been exhausted, so thank you for staying with me.)

2331
01:42:37,652 --> 01:42:39,083
(It will be fun to go on a double date!)

2332
01:42:39,322 --> 01:42:40,852
The talk of the double date...

2333
01:42:40,853 --> 01:42:43,692
made me certain that it was Jung Sub.

2334
01:42:44,492 --> 01:42:47,522
My sister really likes Ji Won.

2335
01:42:47,732 --> 01:42:50,662
I even saw Ji Won play the piano.

2336
01:42:50,862 --> 01:42:54,161
"It would be fun if you played the instrument with my sister."

2337
01:42:54,162 --> 01:42:56,133
"You would be able to do that since you have the skills."

2338
01:42:56,232 --> 01:42:57,941
"My sister will like you even more."

2339
01:42:57,942 --> 01:42:59,772
I said that a lot...

2340
01:43:00,043 --> 01:43:01,442
at the basement hideout early in the morning.

2341
01:43:01,543 --> 01:43:03,143
If an opportunity arises,

2342
01:43:03,242 --> 01:43:06,543
it would be nice to go on a date with Ji Won.

2343
01:43:07,853 --> 01:43:09,912
(Se Seung didn't get a message.)

2344
01:43:13,982 --> 01:43:15,792
I thought to myself...

2345
01:43:15,793 --> 01:43:17,962
that Jung Sub's heart might have changed.

2346
01:43:17,963 --> 01:43:19,763
But I felt frustrated...

2347
01:43:20,093 --> 01:43:21,593
since I couldn't be certain.

2348
01:43:21,692 --> 01:43:23,232
It felt like a nail in the coffin.

2349
01:43:23,532 --> 01:43:24,862
When I didn't receive a message,

2350
01:43:24,963 --> 01:43:27,262
I realized that I was right.

2351
01:43:27,263 --> 01:43:30,673
I could see that there was a change.

2352
01:43:33,973 --> 01:43:36,812
(Cheol Hyun and Jung Sub chose your sibling.)

2353
01:43:42,912 --> 01:43:44,082
(No one chose your sibling.)

2354
01:43:44,083 --> 01:43:45,083
That's right.

2355
01:43:45,084 --> 01:43:47,053
Shall we buy some lettuce?

2356
01:43:48,253 --> 01:43:51,593
(No one chose your sibling.)

2357
01:43:54,263 --> 01:43:57,433
(Cheol Hyun and Jung Sub didn't get a message.)

2358
01:43:58,062 --> 01:43:59,963
I chose "None."

2359
01:44:00,862 --> 01:44:02,603
If that option existed from the start...

2360
01:44:02,702 --> 01:44:05,972
On the day I had a date with Yong Woo,

2361
01:44:05,973 --> 01:44:07,713
I would have sent him a message the same.

2362
01:44:09,713 --> 01:44:11,312
It was a meaningful time.

2363
01:44:12,183 --> 01:44:15,982
But on other days,

2364
01:44:16,083 --> 01:44:18,652
I would have chosen "None."

2365
01:44:19,723 --> 01:44:23,053
(Jung Sub didn't get a message from anyone.)

2366
01:44:24,152 --> 01:44:25,423
I chose "None."

2367
01:44:26,423 --> 01:44:28,833
(No one chose your sibling.)

2368
01:44:34,902 --> 01:44:36,372
I was a bit surprised.

2369
01:44:38,143 --> 01:44:40,371
She had a date with Yong Woo in Gangwon Province.

2370
01:44:40,372 --> 01:44:43,173
Did something happen between her and Yong Woo?

2371
01:44:43,742 --> 01:44:47,311
The moment I realize that I like someone more,

2372
01:44:47,312 --> 01:44:48,652
I lose interest.

2373
01:44:49,152 --> 01:44:52,253
Perhaps I should say that my heart grew cold.

2374
01:44:52,553 --> 01:44:56,593
Se Seung gets along well with the others.

2375
01:44:56,853 --> 01:45:00,562
She is kind and nice to everyone.

2376
01:45:01,022 --> 01:45:04,393
It seemed like she was interested in other people.

2377
01:45:05,503 --> 01:45:08,103
So I didn't feel very disappointed.

2378
01:45:15,242 --> 01:45:17,741
(Jae Hyung checks the message again.)

2379
01:45:17,742 --> 01:45:18,882
Thank you.

2380
01:45:18,883 --> 01:45:21,252
- Thank you for your hard work. - Thank you.

2381
01:45:21,253 --> 01:45:23,482
(He leaves the living room first.)

2382
01:45:31,162 --> 01:45:33,621
I thought a lot about...

2383
01:45:33,622 --> 01:45:35,531
what Jung Sub thinks of Se Seung.

2384
01:45:35,532 --> 01:45:38,701
He went on a few dates with Se Seung...

2385
01:45:38,702 --> 01:45:41,002
and spent a lot of time with her.

2386
01:45:41,003 --> 01:45:44,302
Perhaps he doesn't know if he is interested in her...

2387
01:45:44,303 --> 01:45:46,371
or if the situation simply became this way...

2388
01:45:46,372 --> 01:45:47,941
because he kept spending time with her.

2389
01:45:47,942 --> 01:45:49,812
Perhaps that's what he is confused about.

2390
01:45:49,942 --> 01:45:53,981
Se Seung must have felt troubled.

2391
01:45:53,982 --> 01:45:56,752
She and I talked about it...

2392
01:45:56,753 --> 01:45:58,053
at the hideout.

2393
01:45:58,282 --> 01:46:00,151
Since she didn't get a message,

2394
01:46:00,152 --> 01:46:01,723
she must have thought,

2395
01:46:02,122 --> 01:46:03,692
"Is this the end?"

2396
01:46:04,862 --> 01:46:07,362
This is nerve-racking.

2397
01:46:11,702 --> 01:46:15,933
Seeing the changes with my eyes...

2398
01:46:16,402 --> 01:46:17,473
hurt my feelings.

2399
01:46:18,442 --> 01:46:20,142
(Hanging around)

2400
01:46:20,143 --> 01:46:21,842
Now, we can do it by ourselves.

2401
01:46:21,843 --> 01:46:22,911
(Tapping)

2402
01:46:22,912 --> 01:46:24,981
Yes? The hideout?

2403
01:46:24,982 --> 01:46:26,442
Okay.

2404
01:46:28,812 --> 01:46:30,652
It's my first time using it.

2405
01:46:32,423 --> 01:46:34,793
My goodness.

2406
01:46:36,322 --> 01:46:37,962
My goodness.

2407
01:46:37,963 --> 01:46:40,322
Did you want to choose number one that badly?

2408
01:46:40,562 --> 01:46:42,293
(He makes two people flustered at once.)

2409
01:46:42,893 --> 01:46:45,803
- What? - I totally predicted it.

2410
01:46:45,963 --> 01:46:48,402
I knew that you would risk a failure.

2411
01:46:49,673 --> 01:46:51,503
You need to be separated. Go home.

2412
01:46:51,702 --> 01:46:53,673
It seems like you are a drunkard. Aren't you going to go home?

2413
01:46:53,772 --> 01:46:55,312
I am sorry.

2414
01:46:56,772 --> 01:46:57,772
How was it?

2415
01:46:58,442 --> 01:47:00,741
You messaged Ji Won, right?

2416
01:47:00,742 --> 01:47:02,952
- What? - You messaged Ji Won, right?

2417
01:47:03,152 --> 01:47:05,053
How did you know?

2418
01:47:05,452 --> 01:47:06,952
I heard about it.

2419
01:47:07,383 --> 01:47:10,522
You guys talked until 7am yesterday.

2420
01:47:11,022 --> 01:47:12,222
(Siblings' Room opened at the hideout.)

2421
01:47:12,223 --> 01:47:13,692
You know,

2422
01:47:13,862 --> 01:47:16,192
I got this feeling at Gangwon Province.

2423
01:47:16,333 --> 01:47:20,002
I was getting certain about my feelings.

2424
01:47:20,003 --> 01:47:22,072
But I wasn't sure about...

2425
01:47:22,833 --> 01:47:24,473
how Jae Hyung felt.

2426
01:47:26,973 --> 01:47:29,942
Jae Hyung became the person I was interested in the most.

2427
01:47:30,173 --> 01:47:32,481
He sent me messages every time...

2428
01:47:32,482 --> 01:47:33,682
after a certain point.

2429
01:47:33,683 --> 01:47:34,982
I see. Are you sure about your feelings?

2430
01:47:35,782 --> 01:47:36,853
Yes.

2431
01:47:37,183 --> 01:47:38,521
Perhaps...

2432
01:47:38,522 --> 01:47:41,121
he chose me until now...

2433
01:47:41,122 --> 01:47:43,253
because he had to choose someone.

2434
01:47:43,692 --> 01:47:46,361
- He didn't want to choose anyone, - Right.

2435
01:47:46,362 --> 01:47:48,332
- but he had no other choice. - Right.

2436
01:47:48,333 --> 01:47:51,333
I feel like it became a certainty.

2437
01:47:51,662 --> 01:47:54,032
I think the same. I am certain that was what happened.

2438
01:47:54,702 --> 01:47:55,933
It isn't a bad thing.

2439
01:47:56,202 --> 01:47:59,102
Since he had to message someone,

2440
01:47:59,103 --> 01:48:01,312
he chose after much deliberation.

2441
01:48:01,473 --> 01:48:05,013
I understand that it might not feel good.

2442
01:48:06,412 --> 01:48:10,082
Even in my eyes, Jae Hyung is a charming person.

2443
01:48:10,083 --> 01:48:11,522
He is fun and smart.

2444
01:48:11,753 --> 01:48:15,451
"It won't be easy for you to date a man..."

2445
01:48:15,452 --> 01:48:17,691
"who is as nice as Jae Hyung."

2446
01:48:17,692 --> 01:48:20,222
I want to communicate that to her gently.

2447
01:48:20,223 --> 01:48:22,292
Dating isn't the same...

2448
01:48:22,293 --> 01:48:24,593
as purchasing a cookie by throwing a fit.

2449
01:48:24,662 --> 01:48:26,561
I hope Ju Yeon would realize that...

2450
01:48:26,562 --> 01:48:29,231
and become the best version of herself.

2451
01:48:29,232 --> 01:48:30,632
I think it would be good for Ju Yeon.

2452
01:48:30,633 --> 01:48:32,302
Why wouldn't it look nice?

2453
01:48:32,303 --> 01:48:33,343
I think it would look nice.

2454
01:48:35,242 --> 01:48:36,772
Just relax and have fun.

2455
01:48:37,043 --> 01:48:39,712
If you could go back two hours by using a time machine,

2456
01:48:39,713 --> 01:48:41,013
what would you have sent?

2457
01:48:41,242 --> 01:48:43,611
I would have sent a message to Jae Hyung.

2458
01:48:43,612 --> 01:48:45,952
That's good then. You are cool.

2459
01:48:46,353 --> 01:48:48,352
I thought about it a lot.

2460
01:48:48,353 --> 01:48:51,692
I think doing what I want to do is the right answer.

2461
01:48:51,862 --> 01:48:53,192
(The 1st floor)

2462
01:48:53,763 --> 01:48:55,062
What are they doing?

2463
01:48:56,562 --> 01:48:57,633
What?

2464
01:49:02,372 --> 01:49:03,732
"None" became an option.

2465
01:49:04,072 --> 01:49:05,302
You are right.

2466
01:49:05,303 --> 01:49:08,812
That was why we didn't hear many pings.

2467
01:49:09,072 --> 01:49:11,272
But Yong Woo's phone pinged 2 or 3 times.

2468
01:49:11,782 --> 01:49:13,812
Se Seung and Ji Won.

2469
01:49:14,112 --> 01:49:15,513
- What? - Ji Won.

2470
01:49:15,683 --> 01:49:16,981
- Yong Woo? - What?

2471
01:49:16,982 --> 01:49:19,152
- Yong Woo messaged Ji Won? - No.

2472
01:49:19,282 --> 01:49:21,723
- Ji Won messaged Yong Woo. - Yes.

2473
01:49:21,822 --> 01:49:23,522
- Really? - Yes.

2474
01:49:23,923 --> 01:49:25,923
He was the first person she went on a date with.

2475
01:49:26,423 --> 01:49:27,492
Whom did you message?

2476
01:49:27,862 --> 01:49:29,161
- Yun Jae? Well done. - Yes.

2477
01:49:29,162 --> 01:49:30,861
How was the date?

2478
01:49:30,862 --> 01:49:32,432
- It was fun. - Was it fun?

2479
01:49:32,433 --> 01:49:34,003
- He is very... - Is he nice?

2480
01:49:34,333 --> 01:49:35,702
He is very pure.

2481
01:49:37,272 --> 01:49:40,241
You must have felt it since you drank with him yesterday.

2482
01:49:40,242 --> 01:49:41,242
That's right.

2483
01:49:41,643 --> 01:49:43,572
You didn't choose each other today.

2484
01:49:43,843 --> 01:49:45,582
- Us? Me? - Yes.

2485
01:49:45,583 --> 01:49:47,083
- Me and who? - Se Seung.

2486
01:49:47,183 --> 01:49:48,553
Se Seung? We didn't message each other.

2487
01:49:50,152 --> 01:49:52,052
One time, you didn't receive any messages.

2488
01:49:52,053 --> 01:49:53,582
Right. Back then...

2489
01:49:53,583 --> 01:49:55,521
Your face turned so dark.

2490
01:49:55,522 --> 01:49:57,752
But I was fine. I am fine now.

2491
01:49:57,753 --> 01:49:58,922
- I am fine now. - Are you sure?

2492
01:49:58,923 --> 01:50:00,492
Yes. I am totally fine today.

2493
01:50:00,692 --> 01:50:02,361
To whom did Ji Won send a message?

2494
01:50:02,362 --> 01:50:04,262
I think she messaged Cheol Hyeon.

2495
01:50:04,263 --> 01:50:07,462
You and Cheol Hyeon messaged Ji Won, right?

2496
01:50:07,463 --> 01:50:08,673
- I think so. - Yes.

2497
01:50:09,303 --> 01:50:10,672
- That's right. - Yes.

2498
01:50:10,673 --> 01:50:11,701
That's right.

2499
01:50:11,702 --> 01:50:14,302
- I hope Ji Won chooses me. - What?

2500
01:50:14,303 --> 01:50:16,112
- I hope Ji Won chooses me. - Do you like her?

2501
01:50:16,572 --> 01:50:17,812
- What? - Do you like her?

2502
01:50:17,942 --> 01:50:19,013
She is nice.

2503
01:50:20,713 --> 01:50:23,212
He selfishly said that he would go on a date.

2504
01:50:23,213 --> 01:50:24,781
That's incredible. It ended in one go.

2505
01:50:24,782 --> 01:50:26,252
Yes, it ended in one go.

2506
01:50:26,253 --> 01:50:28,752
I had a feeling that these siblings...

2507
01:50:28,753 --> 01:50:30,022
would do that.

2508
01:50:30,192 --> 01:50:31,491
I was certain...

2509
01:50:31,492 --> 01:50:33,422
that you would yield in the end.

2510
01:50:33,423 --> 01:50:35,832
You knew somewhat...

2511
01:50:35,833 --> 01:50:37,332
that Ji Won would yield.

2512
01:50:37,333 --> 01:50:39,662
Had you yielded as well, no one would have gotten a date.

2513
01:50:39,862 --> 01:50:41,472
Since you guys are only a year apart,

2514
01:50:41,473 --> 01:50:43,402
- Of course. - there must have been many fights.

2515
01:50:43,633 --> 01:50:45,572
We fought so much when we were little.

2516
01:50:45,702 --> 01:50:48,673
In elementary school and middle school, we fought so much.

2517
01:50:48,912 --> 01:50:51,271
I fought with my sibling so much until middle school.

2518
01:50:51,272 --> 01:50:53,382
Why did you guys fight? Did you do it for the TV remote?

2519
01:50:53,383 --> 01:50:54,542
There were no reasons.

2520
01:50:54,543 --> 01:50:56,053
Whenever our eyes met...

2521
01:50:56,253 --> 01:50:57,253
- "What are you looking at?" - "What are you looking at?"

2522
01:50:57,254 --> 01:50:58,321
That's right.

2523
01:50:58,322 --> 01:51:00,082
- It always started with that. - "What are you looking at?"

2524
01:51:00,083 --> 01:51:01,553
There were no reasons to look for a long time.

2525
01:51:04,553 --> 01:51:05,893
So the sibling was asking for a fight.

2526
01:51:06,992 --> 01:51:08,293
- "What are you looking at?" - That's right.

2527
01:51:08,433 --> 01:51:09,833
- There were no reasons. - Understood.

2528
01:51:10,192 --> 01:51:11,192
That's right.

2529
01:51:11,433 --> 01:51:12,702
He got a nosebleed once.

2530
01:51:13,763 --> 01:51:15,772
To play around,

2531
01:51:15,973 --> 01:51:18,542
he threw a fist and stopped right before my nose.

2532
01:51:18,543 --> 01:51:19,543
So I did the same.

2533
01:51:20,372 --> 01:51:23,441
I did this, but I failed to stop.

2534
01:51:23,442 --> 01:51:25,182
I hit his nose, and he bled from both nostrils.

2535
01:51:25,183 --> 01:51:27,342
One time, I threw a pencil sharpener...

2536
01:51:27,343 --> 01:51:28,882
and hit Jae Hyung.

2537
01:51:28,883 --> 01:51:29,883
Really?

2538
01:51:30,112 --> 01:51:31,853
- Did you throw it at me? - I threw it at you.

2539
01:51:32,782 --> 01:51:33,882
- A pencil sharpener. - That was too much.

2540
01:51:33,883 --> 01:51:35,522
- I think it was a pencil sharpener. - "That was too much."

2541
01:51:35,753 --> 01:51:37,152
- Is your nose okay? - What?

2542
01:51:37,423 --> 01:51:38,792
- Is your nose okay? - You got a nosebleed.

2543
01:51:38,793 --> 01:51:39,822
When?

2544
01:51:40,793 --> 01:51:41,862
You look fine.

2545
01:51:42,293 --> 01:51:44,293
- You look fine. - Did you get a nosebleed?

2546
01:51:44,862 --> 01:51:45,902
When?

2547
01:51:46,003 --> 01:51:48,503
You said I got a nosebleed. When did I get a nosebleed?

2548
01:51:48,702 --> 01:51:50,632
- About... - Ten years ago.

2549
01:51:50,633 --> 01:51:51,673
Because you hit me?

2550
01:51:52,343 --> 01:51:54,102
- Back then... - He has nice proportions.

2551
01:51:54,103 --> 01:51:55,512
Yes. His face is small too.

2552
01:51:55,513 --> 01:51:57,372
His face is small. I envy him.

2553
01:51:57,872 --> 01:51:59,742
- He has a handsome nose. - Yes.

2554
01:51:59,843 --> 01:52:01,442
I like men with a handsome nose.

2555
01:52:02,583 --> 01:52:05,422
Ji Won seems like the older sister.

2556
01:52:05,423 --> 01:52:06,522
- Right? - Seriously.

2557
01:52:06,822 --> 01:52:07,883
This is the older son of the family.

2558
01:52:08,423 --> 01:52:09,452
The older daughter.

2559
01:52:09,723 --> 01:52:11,122
- I... - Are you the younger daughter?

2560
01:52:11,322 --> 01:52:12,322
- Yes. - The younger daughter.

2561
01:52:12,423 --> 01:52:13,462
- Yes, I am. - The younger daughter.

2562
01:52:13,463 --> 01:52:14,793
- That was a good one. - The younger daughter.

2563
01:52:15,393 --> 01:52:16,861
- That's my role. - The younger daughter.

2564
01:52:16,862 --> 01:52:17,963
I am really good at doing this.

2565
01:52:18,433 --> 01:52:19,463
You are good.

2566
01:52:19,702 --> 01:52:21,062
I am really good at it too.

2567
01:52:21,362 --> 01:52:23,303
- Don't do it. - "Don't do it."

2568
01:52:24,973 --> 01:52:27,402
(The siblings' conversation ends.)

2569
01:52:28,812 --> 01:52:30,172
- How was it? - What?

2570
01:52:30,173 --> 01:52:31,981
- How was the date? - I had fun.

2571
01:52:31,982 --> 01:52:33,543
Did my sister do well?

2572
01:52:33,883 --> 01:52:34,883
Your sister did well.

2573
01:52:34,884 --> 01:52:36,713
I was the problem.

2574
01:52:36,883 --> 01:52:38,222
Don't say that.

2575
01:52:38,223 --> 01:52:39,722
- If my sister was weird... - I was awkward.

2576
01:52:39,723 --> 01:52:40,982
No, she wasn't like that.

2577
01:52:41,383 --> 01:52:43,353
You chose number one on the phone.

2578
01:52:43,853 --> 01:52:44,853
I chose number one no matter what.

2579
01:52:47,423 --> 01:52:48,491
That's great.

2580
01:52:48,492 --> 01:52:50,692
I think my sister had a lot of fun.

2581
01:52:51,492 --> 01:52:54,133
(Yun Ha is alone in the kitchen.)

2582
01:52:57,272 --> 01:52:59,843
(She begins to clean up.)

2583
01:53:00,603 --> 01:53:03,643
- Isn't it a habit? - What?

2584
01:53:03,843 --> 01:53:05,183
We have to clean up later anyway.

2585
01:53:07,343 --> 01:53:10,452
You clean up quickly.

2586
01:53:11,583 --> 01:53:12,652
Leave it be. I will clean it up.

2587
01:53:15,022 --> 01:53:16,952
(He recycles thoroughly.)

2588
01:53:17,122 --> 01:53:19,293
- It's a good habit. - He recycles thoroughly.

2589
01:53:19,492 --> 01:53:21,392
It's such a good habit.

2590
01:53:21,393 --> 01:53:22,763
It's commendable.

2591
01:53:29,772 --> 01:53:31,603
(He puts the leftover drink in the fridge.)

2592
01:53:31,772 --> 01:53:33,503
(He wraps up thoroughly.)

2593
01:53:34,242 --> 01:53:35,272
I will do the dishes.

2594
01:53:35,872 --> 01:53:36,942
Will you do the dishes?

2595
01:53:38,112 --> 01:53:40,142
Wear these slippers. I am okay.

2596
01:53:40,143 --> 01:53:41,981
- I am okay. - I am okay.

2597
01:53:41,982 --> 01:53:44,812
You aren't wearing an apron.

2598
01:53:44,952 --> 01:53:46,553
It's okay. Water won't splash much.

2599
01:53:46,822 --> 01:53:47,822
I will put it around your neck.

2600
01:53:48,152 --> 01:53:49,492
My goodness.

2601
01:53:49,992 --> 01:53:51,093
Here.

2602
01:53:52,293 --> 01:53:53,322
Thank you.

2603
01:53:53,893 --> 01:53:55,162
(Squeezing his eyes shut)

2604
01:53:55,433 --> 01:53:56,491
- Gosh. - Gosh.

2605
01:53:56,492 --> 01:53:57,561
Gosh.

2606
01:53:57,562 --> 01:53:58,702
An apron left him like this.

2607
01:54:00,503 --> 01:54:01,902
He doesn't need to rub the dishes.

2608
01:54:02,372 --> 01:54:04,932
- He can just be still. - It's the best.

2609
01:54:04,933 --> 01:54:07,102
- An automatic motor system. - That's right.

2610
01:54:07,103 --> 01:54:08,412
He just needs to put soap on the sponge.

2611
01:54:13,183 --> 01:54:14,242
I am sorry.

2612
01:54:15,713 --> 01:54:16,812
Shall I tie the apron?

2613
01:54:17,952 --> 01:54:19,383
Whatever makes you comfortable.

2614
01:54:22,322 --> 01:54:23,692
It's my first time doing this.

2615
01:54:24,923 --> 01:54:26,892
I tied the apron for him.

2616
01:54:26,893 --> 01:54:28,833
I think he was a bit flustered.

2617
01:54:29,763 --> 01:54:30,793
Was it okay to do that?

2618
01:54:32,362 --> 01:54:34,732
If he was nervous,

2619
01:54:35,803 --> 01:54:37,072
it's a good thing.

2620
01:54:37,603 --> 01:54:39,173
You went to bed late last night.

2621
01:54:39,442 --> 01:54:41,043
It hasn't even been 12 hours.

2622
01:54:41,742 --> 01:54:44,042
What did you talk about for so many hours yesterday?

2623
01:54:44,043 --> 01:54:45,112
Yesterday?

2624
01:54:46,013 --> 01:54:47,482
It was really funny yesterday.

2625
01:54:48,043 --> 01:54:49,883
Jung Sub and I sat my brother down...

2626
01:54:51,053 --> 01:54:53,852
and gave him tips.

2627
01:54:53,853 --> 01:54:54,853
What tips?

2628
01:54:54,854 --> 01:54:56,692
He was going on a date with Yun Ha.

2629
01:54:57,393 --> 01:55:01,362
Didn't you feel any pull...

2630
01:55:01,593 --> 01:55:02,593
for Jung Sub?

2631
01:55:02,594 --> 01:55:05,762
When Se Seung and I talked,

2632
01:55:05,763 --> 01:55:09,502
I felt that we had many things in common.

2633
01:55:09,503 --> 01:55:13,002
Since she was interested in Jung Sub,

2634
01:55:13,003 --> 01:55:16,012
she thought I might be the same.

2635
01:55:16,013 --> 01:55:18,173
I think that was why she asked me about Jung Sub.

2636
01:55:19,242 --> 01:55:20,342
In the beginning,

2637
01:55:20,343 --> 01:55:23,753
I could sense that he led the conversation well.

2638
01:55:26,183 --> 01:55:28,522
If I were to be completely honest,

2639
01:55:28,952 --> 01:55:32,191
I thought it would be nice to talk to either Cheol Hyeon...

2640
01:55:32,192 --> 01:55:34,263
or Jung Sub next.

2641
01:55:34,562 --> 01:55:37,862
- But Jae Hyung... - You got to know Jae Hyung.

2642
01:55:38,503 --> 01:55:40,303
changed my mind.

2643
01:55:41,772 --> 01:55:43,272
Now, I don't really...

2644
01:55:44,532 --> 01:55:46,643
I don't think I would try anything...

2645
01:55:46,973 --> 01:55:49,673
with Jung Sub first.

2646
01:55:50,612 --> 01:55:52,812
I had a long conversation with Ji Won.

2647
01:55:53,083 --> 01:55:57,083
I now know that Ji Won isn't interested in Jung Sub.

2648
01:55:57,713 --> 01:55:59,183
"Thank goodness."

2649
01:55:59,883 --> 01:56:02,292
To be honest, I had that thought. At the same time...

2650
01:56:02,293 --> 01:56:05,423
Even if Jung Sub likes Ji Won,

2651
01:56:05,723 --> 01:56:07,492
nothing will happen for now...

2652
01:56:07,822 --> 01:56:12,333
because Ji Won likes my brother, not Jung Sub.

2653
01:56:13,603 --> 01:56:15,572
So I am relieved.

2654
01:56:15,732 --> 01:56:20,143
If my two favourite people, Ji Won and Jung Sub become an item,

2655
01:56:20,543 --> 01:56:22,473
I won't be able to handle it.

2656
01:56:22,673 --> 01:56:26,083
I wonder what Jae Hyung is like.

2657
01:56:26,643 --> 01:56:30,713
To be honest, I thought Jae Hyung was the youngest child.

2658
01:56:31,213 --> 01:56:32,322
He was very...

2659
01:56:33,482 --> 01:56:35,322
(Jae Hyung shows up at that moment.)

2660
01:56:39,593 --> 01:56:41,492
You can come. Are you going to wash up?

2661
01:56:41,662 --> 01:56:43,333
No, I washed up.

2662
01:56:43,532 --> 01:56:44,561
Why did you come?

2663
01:56:44,562 --> 01:56:46,632
I wondered where people were.

2664
01:56:46,633 --> 01:56:48,162
- People are here. - He was wandering around.

2665
01:56:48,362 --> 01:56:49,502
Do you want to join us?

2666
01:56:49,503 --> 01:56:50,872
(He joins them.)

2667
01:56:51,772 --> 01:56:53,272
- Do I need to turn it on? - You need to turn it on.

2668
01:56:55,242 --> 01:56:57,972
- Let's go. - Doesn't it remind you of this?

2669
01:56:57,973 --> 01:56:58,982
The master goes,

2670
01:56:59,543 --> 01:57:00,643
"Go!"

2671
01:57:01,643 --> 01:57:03,382
- "Let's go." - "Show my brother your charms..."

2672
01:57:03,383 --> 01:57:05,553
- "by playing the piano." - "Show your charms."

2673
01:57:06,383 --> 01:57:07,553
"Now is the chance."

2674
01:57:07,782 --> 01:57:11,122
Se Seung will support them so much.

2675
01:57:11,452 --> 01:57:13,922
Having Ji Won and her brother become an item...

2676
01:57:13,923 --> 01:57:15,121
won't inconvenience her one bit.

2677
01:57:15,122 --> 01:57:16,763
- That's right. - Then she should go ahead with it.

2678
01:57:16,963 --> 01:57:18,262
It's good for her too.

2679
01:57:18,263 --> 01:57:19,602
It's good for everyone.

2680
01:57:19,603 --> 01:57:20,803
How did this happen?

2681
01:57:22,673 --> 01:57:23,673
Let's go.

2682
01:57:24,433 --> 01:57:25,673
It's funny..

2683
01:57:25,843 --> 01:57:28,043
because I only know one song.

2684
01:57:28,242 --> 01:57:30,411
Why didn't you go into music?

2685
01:57:30,412 --> 01:57:33,713
Perhaps I was worn out from practicing too hard.

2686
01:57:34,213 --> 01:57:35,282
Is it Yun Jae?

2687
01:57:36,152 --> 01:57:37,782
I recognize him from his voice.

2688
01:57:38,183 --> 01:57:39,822
(Yun Jae joins them.)

2689
01:57:40,782 --> 01:57:41,852
- It's Yun Jae. - Yun Jae.

2690
01:57:41,853 --> 01:57:42,992
It should have been Jung Sub.

2691
01:57:43,293 --> 01:57:44,952
The sound of the piano...

2692
01:57:45,423 --> 01:57:47,322
will draw Jung Sub in.

2693
01:57:49,933 --> 01:57:51,832
(They get goosebumps.)

2694
01:57:51,833 --> 01:57:52,933
It's fun.

2695
01:57:53,062 --> 01:57:54,303
It's so much fun.

2696
01:57:54,833 --> 01:57:56,771
- Gather around, everyone. - What is going on?

2697
01:57:56,772 --> 01:57:58,603
It wasn't Jung Sub's will.

2698
01:57:59,303 --> 01:58:00,372
That's right.

2699
01:58:00,742 --> 01:58:02,472
- It was like this. - That's right,

2700
01:58:02,473 --> 01:58:04,872
- Like "The Pied Piper of Hamelin." - He was sleeping.

2701
01:58:09,883 --> 01:58:11,552
- This happened. - Yes.

2702
01:58:11,553 --> 01:58:12,553
Precisely.

2703
01:58:12,554 --> 01:58:13,821
- He was sleeping. - It's fun.

2704
01:58:13,822 --> 01:58:15,021
It happened like this.

2705
01:58:15,022 --> 01:58:16,652
- It's fun. - This is incredible.

2706
01:58:18,822 --> 01:58:21,192
(It's the piano sound he heard early in the morning.)

2707
01:58:30,032 --> 01:58:33,072
(He is hesitant.)

2708
01:58:34,103 --> 01:58:35,672
I didn't drink,

2709
01:58:35,673 --> 01:58:37,772
but there were members who did.

2710
01:58:38,043 --> 01:58:40,912
Ji Won, Yun Jae, Jae Hyung, and Se Seung.

2711
01:58:41,742 --> 01:58:44,253
I wondered what they were talking about.

2712
01:58:45,583 --> 01:58:47,683
(He enters on his third try.)

2713
01:58:53,923 --> 01:58:55,093
(Hesitant)

2714
01:58:58,933 --> 01:59:00,103
You guys are having a meeting.

2715
01:59:00,402 --> 01:59:03,272
- Other people went to bed. - I see.

2716
01:59:03,833 --> 01:59:06,173
- Are you going to go to bed? - I am going to do that.

2717
01:59:10,072 --> 01:59:12,043
That's incredible. She plays the piano so well.

2718
01:59:12,942 --> 01:59:15,112
(He hums the number Ji Won played on the piano.)

2719
01:59:17,753 --> 01:59:19,852
Oh, no. He is organizing the shoes...

2720
01:59:19,853 --> 01:59:21,621
- as if he is in a trance. - Seriously.

2721
01:59:21,622 --> 01:59:22,622
Jung Sub.

2722
01:59:23,793 --> 01:59:24,821
- It's as if he is in a trance. - How scary.

2723
01:59:24,822 --> 01:59:27,321
Nothing is his own will.

2724
01:59:27,322 --> 01:59:29,231
- No. Ji Won went, - How scary.

2725
01:59:29,232 --> 01:59:32,232
"Organize the shoes." She did that.

2726
01:59:34,562 --> 01:59:36,401
He won't remember it.

2727
01:59:36,402 --> 01:59:38,072
The next morning, he will go, "My goodness."

2728
01:59:38,303 --> 01:59:40,343
"What? Did I organize the shoes?"

2729
01:59:41,702 --> 01:59:44,072
(He hums the number Ji Won played on the piano.)

2730
01:59:46,442 --> 01:59:47,981
You praised...

2731
01:59:47,982 --> 01:59:49,911
- Jae Hyung's introduction. - That's right.

2732
01:59:49,912 --> 01:59:51,411
- The one I wrote? - You were praising me.

2733
01:59:51,412 --> 01:59:52,451
No.

2734
01:59:52,452 --> 01:59:53,452
- The one she wrote. - The one I wrote.

2735
01:59:53,453 --> 01:59:55,281
- The one Se Seung wrote. - That one?

2736
01:59:55,282 --> 01:59:58,223
I only read Jae Hyung's.

2737
01:59:58,353 --> 01:59:59,792
- There weren't any others. - Do you know what it means?

2738
01:59:59,793 --> 02:00:01,722
It means only Jae Hyung didn't take it.

2739
02:00:01,723 --> 02:00:02,731
Seriously.

2740
02:00:02,732 --> 02:00:04,592
Everyone else took it,

2741
02:00:04,593 --> 02:00:06,462
- Seriously. - so only Jae Hyung's remained.

2742
02:00:06,463 --> 02:00:07,762
- Why... - He didn't take it.

2743
02:00:07,763 --> 02:00:09,732
I should go and take a photo.

2744
02:00:10,572 --> 02:00:12,042
I should go and take a photo.

2745
02:00:12,043 --> 02:00:14,202
- He is ridiculous. - That's so funny.

2746
02:00:15,072 --> 02:00:16,673
- Do you want to read mine? - Yes.

2747
02:00:17,173 --> 02:00:18,472
There is a part about steamed buns.

2748
02:00:18,473 --> 02:00:21,411
Reading this will let me know about Jae Hyung.

2749
02:00:21,412 --> 02:00:22,412
It reveals his personality.

2750
02:00:22,413 --> 02:00:24,412
When you know him, it reveals his personality.

2751
02:00:24,713 --> 02:00:26,652
- It suits Jae Hyung. - Yes.

2752
02:00:28,022 --> 02:00:29,652
I bet he wrote it well.

2753
02:00:30,293 --> 02:00:32,963
He wrote it well. I was surprised by what he wrote.

2754
02:00:34,293 --> 02:00:35,793
Look back upon yourself.

2755
02:00:36,062 --> 02:00:37,793
Reading four lines already made me look back upon myself.

2756
02:00:38,032 --> 02:00:39,702
It was hard for me to write it.

2757
02:00:40,702 --> 02:00:43,932
We didn't share what we wrote.

2758
02:00:43,933 --> 02:00:45,401
I wrote it first.

2759
02:00:45,402 --> 02:00:46,871
He asked me how much I wrote,

2760
02:00:46,872 --> 02:00:48,741
so I told him that I had two pages on PDF.

2761
02:00:48,742 --> 02:00:51,572
Then he went, "Gosh, what I have won't be enough."

2762
02:00:52,213 --> 02:00:54,312
Gosh, look at her gaze.

2763
02:00:54,812 --> 02:00:55,812
My goodness.

2764
02:00:56,013 --> 02:00:59,083
Ji Won is very curious about Jae Hyung.

2765
02:00:59,522 --> 02:01:00,752
- He rewrote it. - I rewrote it.

2766
02:01:00,753 --> 02:01:01,853
He put more heart into it.

2767
02:01:02,423 --> 02:01:05,021
Now, I don't want to read other introductions...

2768
02:01:05,022 --> 02:01:06,192
- because... - You don't want to do that.

2769
02:01:06,463 --> 02:01:08,362
I am afraid that they will affect my thoughts.

2770
02:01:08,692 --> 02:01:11,633
It's better to judge people by myself.

2771
02:01:12,103 --> 02:01:15,532
Still, it was nice to read Jae Hyung's introduction.

2772
02:01:19,402 --> 02:01:23,473
Ji Won is someone I want to see by my brother's side.

2773
02:01:23,872 --> 02:01:26,512
With her depth and warmth,

2774
02:01:26,513 --> 02:01:30,611
she can bring out the best in my brother. That thought...

2775
02:01:30,612 --> 02:01:32,622
made me compliment my brother a lot.

2776
02:01:33,223 --> 02:01:35,692
- Let's go to bed. - Good night.

2777
02:01:37,723 --> 02:01:39,723
(Se Seung, Ju Yeon, and Ji Won's room)

2778
02:01:42,893 --> 02:01:45,061
I don't know what Jung Sub is thinking.

2779
02:01:45,062 --> 02:01:46,463
I can't be certain.

2780
02:01:47,103 --> 02:01:50,032
I think some things might have changed.

2781
02:01:51,072 --> 02:01:54,472
But when I talked to him yesterday,

2782
02:01:54,473 --> 02:01:57,543
he seemed to be a bit hurt.

2783
02:01:58,043 --> 02:01:59,781
(Se Seung)

2784
02:01:59,782 --> 02:02:01,843
But you might not be the reason why...

2785
02:02:02,353 --> 02:02:04,412
he felt hurt.

2786
02:02:05,112 --> 02:02:06,282
Did you struggle a bit?

2787
02:02:06,923 --> 02:02:09,122
I had a chance to go on a date with someone.

2788
02:02:09,452 --> 02:02:11,992
I tried my best for her,

2789
02:02:12,192 --> 02:02:14,463
but she didn't send me a message.

2790
02:02:14,793 --> 02:02:16,932
I thought I would be fine,

2791
02:02:16,933 --> 02:02:19,833
but it made me think more than I expected.

2792
02:02:20,232 --> 02:02:23,771
I made an attempt to talk to her,

2793
02:02:23,772 --> 02:02:25,772
but she shut me down...

2794
02:02:26,442 --> 02:02:28,003
so that I would understand her lack of interest.

2795
02:02:28,872 --> 02:02:31,143
In a sense, I am thankful for her.

2796
02:02:33,482 --> 02:02:34,513
In any case,

2797
02:02:36,083 --> 02:02:40,753
Jung Sub seemed to be a bit exhausted.

2798
02:02:42,622 --> 02:02:46,793
That's why I am taking a step back.

2799
02:02:47,492 --> 02:02:48,962
I don't know what's going on.

2800
02:02:48,963 --> 02:02:51,293
I don't know the reason behind the change.

2801
02:02:52,232 --> 02:02:53,531
(Sighing)

2802
02:02:53,532 --> 02:02:54,562
It's hard.

2803
02:02:55,772 --> 02:02:57,202
It's hard.

2804
02:02:58,503 --> 02:03:00,902
It's hard. It's so hard.

2805
02:03:07,883 --> 02:03:11,312
(The complicated night deepens.)

2806
02:03:12,383 --> 02:03:14,322
(What's going on right now?)

2807
02:03:14,553 --> 02:03:15,922
(Do you want me to be honest?)

2808
02:03:15,923 --> 02:03:17,492
(Yes! Hold on.)

2809
02:03:18,223 --> 02:03:20,361
(He was someone I liked a lot,)

2810
02:03:20,362 --> 02:03:22,062
(so I felt hurt.)

2811
02:03:22,333 --> 02:03:24,793
(I was only interested in one person.)

2812
02:03:25,293 --> 02:03:27,462
(The percentages were 100, 0, and 0.)

2813
02:03:27,463 --> 02:03:28,463
(But now,)

2814
02:03:28,562 --> 02:03:30,202
(there has been a change.)

2815
02:03:35,372 --> 02:03:37,771
(So many things can change.)

2816
02:03:37,772 --> 02:03:39,043
(It drives me crazy.)

2817
02:03:39,843 --> 02:03:40,843
("Right now,")

2818
02:03:41,213 --> 02:03:42,353
("you can reveal your age.")

2819
02:03:44,213 --> 02:03:45,923
(Finally, the time has come.)

2820
02:03:46,122 --> 02:03:47,553
(How old do you think I am?)

2821
02:03:47,753 --> 02:03:48,753
(In the 90s.)

2822
02:03:49,992 --> 02:03:51,322
(Really?)

2823
02:03:51,522 --> 02:03:53,662
(I was very shocked upon hearing her age.)

2824
02:03:53,862 --> 02:03:57,463
(I could feel that he was flustered even without looking at him.)

2825
02:03:59,003 --> 02:04:00,202
(My palms suddenly turned sweaty.)
