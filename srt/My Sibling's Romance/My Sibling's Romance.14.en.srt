1
00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:02,281
(Seriously. This is so funny.)

2
00:00:02,282 --> 00:00:05,881
(The five couples of new pairings spent the day together.)

3
00:00:05,882 --> 00:00:07,651
(I didn't know much about him.)

4
00:00:07,652 --> 00:00:10,352
(But it turned out Yun Jae was very sweet.)

5
00:00:10,353 --> 00:00:13,122
(The scenery was beautiful, we could even see the moon.)

6
00:00:13,123 --> 00:00:16,521
(The hotel pool was so romantic.)

7
00:00:16,522 --> 00:00:18,892
(It felt like the climax had begun.)

8
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:21,162
(It was perfect. It was wonderful.)

9
00:00:21,163 --> 00:00:23,001
(You know this is...)

10
00:00:23,002 --> 00:00:25,171
(one of the variables.)

11
00:00:25,172 --> 00:00:26,803
(This could become a rebellion.)

12
00:00:27,473 --> 00:00:29,972
(- You have pretty hands. - I do?)

13
00:00:29,973 --> 00:00:32,342
(I've been wearing it since that evening.)

14
00:00:32,343 --> 00:00:36,912
(Should I send the message to Se Seung after today's date?)

15
00:00:36,913 --> 00:00:39,513
(How deep was it?)

16
00:00:41,312 --> 00:00:45,192
(Enough for me to want to avoid talking about it.)

17
00:00:45,193 --> 00:00:47,122
(I was a bit surprised...)

18
00:00:47,123 --> 00:00:49,421
(because I didn't expect that at all.)

19
00:00:49,422 --> 00:00:51,122
(Have you ever felt this way before?)

20
00:00:51,123 --> 00:00:53,061
(This person is very similar to you.)

21
00:00:53,062 --> 00:00:57,662
(So similar that you feel like you shouldn't be with them.)

22
00:00:57,702 --> 00:00:59,801
(But I feel like even if you may butt heads,)

23
00:00:59,802 --> 00:01:01,902
(being similar is better. That's just me.)

24
00:01:01,903 --> 00:01:05,713
(Yong Woo and I had a lot of incoherent conversations.)

25
00:01:06,472 --> 00:01:09,781
(It was nice although I probably shouldn't have felt that way.)

26
00:01:09,782 --> 00:01:13,912
(Did their third date in Singapore become a variable?)

27
00:01:15,422 --> 00:01:17,322
(Cho A, I have something to say.)

28
00:01:17,323 --> 00:01:23,792
(For the first time upon joining the show,)

29
00:01:23,793 --> 00:01:26,262
(the content of my message might change.)

30
00:01:26,263 --> 00:01:30,402
(Although I was feeling the change in his behaviours,)

31
00:01:30,403 --> 00:01:36,141
(it was quite shocking to hear it in definite words.)

32
00:01:36,142 --> 00:01:38,773
(They sent messages with confused hearts.)

33
00:01:39,073 --> 00:01:40,141
(You have 3 days before making the final decision.)

34
00:01:40,142 --> 00:01:41,212
(Who made your heart flutter today?)

35
00:01:41,213 --> 00:01:42,513
(Send the name and message and we will deliver it anonymously.)

36
00:01:42,843 --> 00:01:47,012
(Se Seung sent the message to Cheol Hyeon.)

37
00:01:47,013 --> 00:01:51,483
(Not receiving any messages put me in a bad mood.)

38
00:01:53,523 --> 00:01:57,122
(Yun Ha sent the message to Yong Woo.)

39
00:01:57,123 --> 00:01:59,592
(I am anxious that Yun Ha might not send me...)

40
00:01:59,593 --> 00:02:01,703
(more messages.)

41
00:02:05,502 --> 00:02:07,902
(Yong Woo sent the message...)

42
00:02:07,903 --> 00:02:09,402
(to Yun Ha.)

43
00:02:09,403 --> 00:02:13,742
(I sent Yun Ha a message and thanked her.)

44
00:02:13,743 --> 00:02:15,642
(I received a very hip message.)

45
00:02:15,643 --> 00:02:17,343
(It was very refreshing.)

46
00:02:19,852 --> 00:02:23,082
(All messages have been sent.)

47
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:26,592
(Cho A didn't receive a message from Yong Woo for the first time.)

48
00:02:26,593 --> 00:02:30,892
(I couldn't describe my feeling.)

49
00:02:30,893 --> 00:02:32,661
(Cho A sat to my right.)

50
00:02:32,662 --> 00:02:34,462
(She typed "A woman's hunch is indeed science" on her phone...)

51
00:02:34,463 --> 00:02:36,302
(and showed it to me.)

52
00:02:36,303 --> 00:02:39,433
(All the messages were sent out with tension in the air.)

53
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:42,373
- Cheers. - Cheers.

54
00:02:42,843 --> 00:02:44,202
- Cheers. - By the way,

55
00:02:44,203 --> 00:02:46,773
I had the strangest feelings today since joining the show.

56
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:50,541
- Actually, I felt that. - You did?

57
00:02:50,542 --> 00:02:52,911
I felt it when you started drinking.

58
00:02:52,912 --> 00:02:55,352
- Really? - It was a different vibe.

59
00:02:57,583 --> 00:02:59,952
Well, to be completely honest,

60
00:02:59,953 --> 00:03:01,862
we don't have much time left now.

61
00:03:01,863 --> 00:03:06,262
Whenever we had to send a message, I just kept...

62
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,031
- sending it to the same person... - Right.

63
00:03:08,032 --> 00:03:09,262
- for 16 days. - Yes.

64
00:03:09,703 --> 00:03:12,403
- But for the first time today, - Did it change?

65
00:03:13,132 --> 00:03:14,472
I made a neutral decision.

66
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,212
Right. You have the same eyes.

67
00:03:25,213 --> 00:03:26,982
(Cho A comes down.)

68
00:03:27,213 --> 00:03:30,282
- What is it? - Well, you know we have...

69
00:03:30,553 --> 00:03:32,351
- one more left. - Yes.

70
00:03:32,352 --> 00:03:33,352
That...

71
00:03:33,353 --> 00:03:35,161
What did he mean by "a neutral decision?"

72
00:03:35,162 --> 00:03:36,422
- It means he's back to square one. - Right. What does that mean?

73
00:03:36,423 --> 00:03:37,892
Like he's open to anyone.

74
00:03:37,893 --> 00:03:39,692
- He must've wanted to tell them. - He could've meant that.

75
00:03:40,162 --> 00:03:41,662
In front of Yun Ha and Ji Won.

76
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:44,303
He must've done that for a reason in front of them. Right?

77
00:03:45,072 --> 00:03:46,302
Oh, my.

78
00:03:46,303 --> 00:03:48,333
(Han Hye Jin)

79
00:03:49,042 --> 00:03:51,203
- Did you get a message? - What?

80
00:03:51,373 --> 00:03:52,712
Me? Yes.

81
00:03:52,713 --> 00:03:54,743
Nice. That's good.

82
00:03:55,482 --> 00:03:58,713
He said he made a neutral decision.

83
00:03:59,053 --> 00:04:00,153
Who said that?

84
00:04:00,912 --> 00:04:01,953
Who?

85
00:04:02,352 --> 00:04:03,423
Yong Woo.

86
00:04:03,882 --> 00:04:05,193
He said he made a neutral decision?

87
00:04:05,253 --> 00:04:06,722
Nothing about that was neutral.

88
00:04:07,253 --> 00:04:09,763
- Really? Does he like someone else? - Yes.

89
00:04:10,662 --> 00:04:13,892
Yes. He told me that someone else made his heart flutter.

90
00:04:13,893 --> 00:04:15,162
- Really? - Yes.

91
00:04:15,362 --> 00:04:17,563
But I'm not sure either.

92
00:04:18,203 --> 00:04:20,102
I don't understand what he means by that.

93
00:04:20,472 --> 00:04:23,273
A lot of things happened today and got tangled up.

94
00:04:23,443 --> 00:04:24,802
Yes. I could see that.

95
00:04:24,972 --> 00:04:27,542
Se Seung sent her message to someone else.

96
00:04:27,943 --> 00:04:29,512
It was exactly what we talked about earlier.

97
00:04:29,513 --> 00:04:31,781
- Right. It got so messy. - Yes.

98
00:04:31,782 --> 00:04:33,213
Is this "The Truman Show?"

99
00:04:33,253 --> 00:04:35,181
- I think... - It's like "The Truman Show."

100
00:04:35,182 --> 00:04:36,653
I told you I was getting a hunch.

101
00:04:36,753 --> 00:04:38,622
- What? - I told you I was getting a hunch.

102
00:04:41,193 --> 00:04:42,823
You know what's funny?

103
00:04:42,862 --> 00:04:44,491
Now that things are going well with him and Ji Won,

104
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:46,062
he's starting to pay attention to other people's business.

105
00:04:46,063 --> 00:04:47,133
- Right? - Oh, no.

106
00:04:47,862 --> 00:04:49,002
But if Yong Woo says...

107
00:04:49,003 --> 00:04:51,562
- he's interested in Ji Won? - Right.

108
00:04:51,563 --> 00:04:53,602
This won't be fun for him then.

109
00:04:54,032 --> 00:04:55,203
You can be quite cruel.

110
00:04:57,372 --> 00:04:59,712
- Right. - For Jae Hyung,

111
00:04:59,713 --> 00:05:02,681
Cho A and Yong Woo need to get along well.

112
00:05:02,682 --> 00:05:04,742
That way, he will have one fewer competitor.

113
00:05:05,883 --> 00:05:07,253
What's he thinking?

114
00:05:07,453 --> 00:05:09,981
Then we have Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday left.

115
00:05:09,982 --> 00:05:11,281
- Yes. - We have three days left. Right?

116
00:05:11,282 --> 00:05:14,592
- Yes. - A lot can change in three days...

117
00:05:14,593 --> 00:05:17,023
- Right. - after seeing what happened today.

118
00:05:20,532 --> 00:05:21,763
Goodnight, Cho A.

119
00:05:21,963 --> 00:05:24,232
(Jae Hyung and Se Seung's room)

120
00:05:26,372 --> 00:05:28,741
- Could you tell me in detail? - What?

121
00:05:28,742 --> 00:05:29,971
Cho A and Jung Sub.

122
00:05:29,972 --> 00:05:32,642
It's what you already know. In Gangwon Province...

123
00:05:32,643 --> 00:05:35,013
No, I don't know anything. I never talked about it in detail.

124
00:05:35,513 --> 00:05:38,242
Could you tell me what happened in more detail?

125
00:05:38,343 --> 00:05:40,213
I didn't hear what happened in detail, though.

126
00:05:40,552 --> 00:05:42,023
What did she tell you?

127
00:05:42,682 --> 00:05:46,252
They went to Gangwon Province on their date.

128
00:05:46,253 --> 00:05:47,653
- And they started talking. - Yes.

129
00:05:47,792 --> 00:05:49,263
But when he was talking to her,

130
00:05:49,492 --> 00:05:51,893
he made himself so clear to her that she was quite surprised.

131
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:54,463
She said it was enough to make her feel surprised.

132
00:05:55,162 --> 00:05:56,632
That's what Cho A said.

133
00:05:56,633 --> 00:05:58,833
That also made her feel uncomfortable.

134
00:05:59,133 --> 00:06:01,171
That's how serious it was.

135
00:06:01,172 --> 00:06:02,471
But after their date in Gangwon Province,

136
00:06:02,472 --> 00:06:03,772
she said things got better.

137
00:06:03,773 --> 00:06:06,073
That's right. But...

138
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:11,212
I don't understand how he could have...

139
00:06:11,213 --> 00:06:14,152
made himself that clear when we had just started living together.

140
00:06:14,153 --> 00:06:15,981
- How is that possible? - But here's what I think.

141
00:06:15,982 --> 00:06:17,121
You know what he told me...

142
00:06:17,122 --> 00:06:18,252
when we were clearing up the misunderstanding?

143
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:20,192
He told me that he wasn't certain about me in the beginning.

144
00:06:20,193 --> 00:06:23,621
So I'm fine as long as he wants to get to know other people here.

145
00:06:23,622 --> 00:06:25,393
That's why we were going to Gangwon Province,

146
00:06:25,492 --> 00:06:28,661
I had in mind that it was possible for him to develop an interest...

147
00:06:28,662 --> 00:06:30,332
in someone else or have a change of heart.

148
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:31,563
I prepared for that.

149
00:06:31,802 --> 00:06:35,843
But judging by the way he behaves, things don't add up.

150
00:06:35,972 --> 00:06:38,171
When we were on a date, he made himself clear to me.

151
00:06:38,172 --> 00:06:39,471
Then he did the same thing to someone else.

152
00:06:39,472 --> 00:06:40,942
How could he keep making himself clear to us on the first date...

153
00:06:40,943 --> 00:06:41,982
when he knew nothing about us?

154
00:06:42,282 --> 00:06:45,312
Here's what I felt from Jung Sub.

155
00:06:45,313 --> 00:06:47,253
He made his interest very clear to me from the get-go.

156
00:06:47,352 --> 00:06:50,152
I thought, "What if he changes his mind?"

157
00:06:50,153 --> 00:06:52,252
The fact that he did the same thing to someone else...

158
00:06:52,253 --> 00:06:55,861
made me feel that I couldn't trust him anymore.

159
00:06:55,862 --> 00:06:57,093
That crossed my mind.

160
00:06:57,222 --> 00:06:59,031
That might not have been his intention.

161
00:06:59,032 --> 00:07:01,732
Maybe, that's how she could've felt.

162
00:07:02,133 --> 00:07:03,661
Then he shouldn't have explained it to me like that...

163
00:07:03,662 --> 00:07:05,003
if he were going to behave like that.

164
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,333
I just think that's kind of ridiculous.

165
00:07:13,672 --> 00:07:15,383
- He sensed something went wrong. - Right.

166
00:07:15,513 --> 00:07:18,042
- He felt it. - He sensed something went wrong.

167
00:07:18,412 --> 00:07:19,681
- Why did you do that? - Gosh.

168
00:07:19,682 --> 00:07:21,253
Just pay attention to Ji Won.

169
00:07:21,412 --> 00:07:23,722
Jae Hyung didn't spend all of his energy on his date today.

170
00:07:25,393 --> 00:07:27,523
But he didn't make up anything.

171
00:07:27,693 --> 00:07:30,991
But I might say the same thing to Patricia.

172
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:31,992
- Right. - You know?

173
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:34,092
- I might say it to my sibling... - Right.

174
00:07:34,093 --> 00:07:35,702
- come to think of it. - To make things clear.

175
00:07:35,703 --> 00:07:37,031
Jae Hyung also knew that...

176
00:07:37,032 --> 00:07:38,361
- she had a hard time... - She did.

177
00:07:38,362 --> 00:07:40,502
- because of Jung Sub. - Right.

178
00:07:40,503 --> 00:07:41,971
If my sibling was in front of me,

179
00:07:41,972 --> 00:07:43,671
- given the new information I got, - Right.

180
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:45,642
- I might bring it up. - Totally.

181
00:07:45,643 --> 00:07:47,142
- I think I might do the same. - I agree.

182
00:07:47,143 --> 00:07:49,541
I wouldn't bring it up. Is that really necessary?

183
00:07:49,542 --> 00:07:51,182
- I wouldn't bring it up either. - Me neither.

184
00:07:51,213 --> 00:07:52,681
I would do it for my sibling,

185
00:07:52,682 --> 00:07:54,181
- not for my friend. - Right.

186
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,322
But the point is, after talking to Jae Hyung,

187
00:07:56,323 --> 00:07:59,453
- Se Seung is completely angry. - Right.

188
00:08:07,463 --> 00:08:08,731
Actually, at first,

189
00:08:08,732 --> 00:08:10,931
I thought, "Maybe, I shouldn't have told her."

190
00:08:10,932 --> 00:08:12,532
That crossed my mind.

191
00:08:12,773 --> 00:08:14,702
But she's not just someone I know. She's my family.

192
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:16,541
So telling her everything I knew was the right call.

193
00:08:16,542 --> 00:08:19,513
She's my sister. I should tell her everything I know.

194
00:08:20,142 --> 00:08:23,982
But if I didn't give her any information I knew,

195
00:08:24,183 --> 00:08:27,152
it would be a huge disadvantage to my sister.

196
00:08:27,313 --> 00:08:30,121
I just delivered objective facts.

197
00:08:30,122 --> 00:08:31,683
It's up to her to make her decision.

198
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:33,923
She's an adult too.

199
00:08:34,392 --> 00:08:37,021
But here's what's important. After that date,

200
00:08:37,022 --> 00:08:39,231
when he had a chance to express his interest,

201
00:08:39,232 --> 00:08:41,693
he chose you every single time.

202
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:43,933
Then it's okay.

203
00:08:45,972 --> 00:08:47,673
To me, the past is important too.

204
00:08:49,443 --> 00:08:50,502
Then...

205
00:08:51,972 --> 00:08:54,042
But think about what happened today.

206
00:08:54,043 --> 00:08:55,712
You liked the date you went on.

207
00:08:55,713 --> 00:08:57,241
So you sent the message to the guy you went on a date with...

208
00:08:57,242 --> 00:09:00,812
Here's why I sent it to him. I enjoyed today's date.

209
00:09:00,813 --> 00:09:04,423
Cheol Hyeon was the right person to go on this date with.

210
00:09:04,622 --> 00:09:06,122
Then you liked him as a person.

211
00:09:06,193 --> 00:09:07,693
But the message said "today."

212
00:09:10,022 --> 00:09:11,492
But everyone...

213
00:09:11,522 --> 00:09:13,361
- I had nothing with Ji Won today. - That moment...

214
00:09:13,362 --> 00:09:15,762
I know! Everyone did the same thing as you.

215
00:09:16,063 --> 00:09:18,062
Then explain to him why you sent the message...

216
00:09:18,063 --> 00:09:19,631
to Cheol Hyeon. Jung Sub...

217
00:09:19,632 --> 00:09:21,672
I wanted to clear up the misunderstanding.

218
00:09:21,673 --> 00:09:23,271
But after hearing what he did to Cho A,

219
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:25,303
my feelings for Jung Sub...

220
00:09:27,642 --> 00:09:30,382
That happened in the beginning of the filming.

221
00:09:30,642 --> 00:09:32,582
Cho A could not have understood him accurately.

222
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:34,582
But do you know what he said after what he did to Cho A?

223
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:37,823
He said that I was too cheerful toward everyone.

224
00:09:38,122 --> 00:09:40,892
What about him? He did that when no one was looking.

225
00:09:42,862 --> 00:09:45,021
We're in a special environment.

226
00:09:45,022 --> 00:09:47,062
Flirting with other people is allowed.

227
00:09:47,063 --> 00:09:50,261
That's why I didn't have any right to get mad at him...

228
00:09:50,262 --> 00:09:52,872
or get angry about this.

229
00:09:52,972 --> 00:09:55,302
Simply being curious and wanting to get to know someone...

230
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:58,141
versus making everyone think he's certain about them...

231
00:09:58,142 --> 00:09:59,672
are two different things in my head.

232
00:09:59,673 --> 00:10:01,641
Anyway, I wanted to find someone I was interested in...

233
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:05,111
and someone I wanted to get to know for a long time.

234
00:10:05,112 --> 00:10:07,052
So I couldn't continue to be interested in him anymore.

235
00:10:07,053 --> 00:10:08,151
That crossed my mind.

236
00:10:08,152 --> 00:10:10,322
That was the moment...

237
00:10:10,323 --> 00:10:12,622
I became the most closed-off toward Jung Sub.

238
00:10:16,892 --> 00:10:18,063
What do you want to do?

239
00:10:19,132 --> 00:10:20,862
I suddenly don't want to do anything.

240
00:10:21,593 --> 00:10:23,401
You said it was getting interesting. Who were you talking about?

241
00:10:23,402 --> 00:10:24,833
- Everyone. - Everyone?

242
00:10:25,872 --> 00:10:28,501
I think only Ji Won and I survived...

243
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:29,803
from this.

244
00:10:30,142 --> 00:10:32,072
Yun Jae and Yun Ha. Yong Woo and Cho A.

245
00:10:32,073 --> 00:10:33,271
- They're all breaking up. - What?

246
00:10:33,272 --> 00:10:35,511
- They're all breaking up. - They're all breaking up?

247
00:10:35,512 --> 00:10:37,882
You just broke up another couple.

248
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:42,651
- Gosh. - Right.

249
00:10:42,652 --> 00:10:43,652
It's true.

250
00:10:44,652 --> 00:10:46,923
- They're all breaking up. - They're all breaking up?

251
00:10:47,122 --> 00:10:48,622
This is a huge mess.

252
00:10:49,392 --> 00:10:51,292
A lot of things changed especially today.

253
00:10:51,293 --> 00:10:53,392
All of a sudden, things are going well only for you. Darn it.

254
00:10:53,762 --> 00:10:54,892
Are you happy?

255
00:10:55,033 --> 00:10:56,963
Or talk to Cho A.

256
00:10:57,762 --> 00:10:58,972
Listen to both parties.

257
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:00,833
I suddenly...

258
00:11:03,543 --> 00:11:05,843
All of a sudden, it's... Boom.

259
00:11:08,142 --> 00:11:09,283
This is fun.

260
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:12,712
But...

261
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:14,913
Gosh. I can't believe Yong Woo changed his mind.

262
00:11:15,183 --> 00:11:17,052
- It looked like his feelings... - How is that possible?

263
00:11:17,053 --> 00:11:18,922
were bigger than hers.

264
00:11:18,923 --> 00:11:20,752
- Right. - But they weren't.

265
00:11:21,293 --> 00:11:23,362
Cho A's feelings for him were bigger.

266
00:11:25,193 --> 00:11:27,593
I should get one if I can find it.

267
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:29,803
Ji Won, who's your date tomorrow?

268
00:11:32,303 --> 00:11:34,772
- Did you pick someone? - You'll ask me outright like that?

269
00:11:35,033 --> 00:11:36,741
- You almost answered him, right? - Yes.

270
00:11:36,742 --> 00:11:38,472
I almost said it. "My date..."

271
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:40,741
- I was waiting for it. - Gosh. Cheol Hyeon.

272
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:42,641
This is funnier. Everyone at the table...

273
00:11:42,642 --> 00:11:45,213
- didn't stop him. - We were watching.

274
00:11:45,683 --> 00:11:47,413
- "Fess up." - I'm so curious.

275
00:11:48,183 --> 00:11:50,783
You guys both chose your date, right?

276
00:11:51,152 --> 00:11:52,721
(Jung Sub hasn't chosen his date yet.)

277
00:11:52,722 --> 00:11:54,553
I don't know. Maybe, they have to do something.

278
00:11:54,722 --> 00:11:55,892
But...

279
00:11:56,793 --> 00:11:58,423
there won't be much left.

280
00:12:00,892 --> 00:12:04,261
Usually, Se Seung and I meet up in the evening and talk.

281
00:12:04,262 --> 00:12:06,731
But Se Seung didn't come downstairs.

282
00:12:06,732 --> 00:12:08,971
It didn't look like she wanted to talk to me.

283
00:12:08,972 --> 00:12:10,901
She went upstairs right away after the messages.

284
00:12:10,902 --> 00:12:14,142
So I was like, "What? What's going on with her?"

285
00:12:14,573 --> 00:12:16,111
It made me wonder...

286
00:12:16,112 --> 00:12:18,511
if some stuff from the day before made her upset.

287
00:12:18,512 --> 00:12:20,111
When she started to be alone for a long time,

288
00:12:20,112 --> 00:12:22,453
I suddenly had a lot on my mind.

289
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:24,852
I wanted to ask her out on the date.

290
00:12:39,933 --> 00:12:40,933
Yes.

291
00:12:41,872 --> 00:12:43,672
- Se Seung. - Yes?

292
00:12:43,673 --> 00:12:45,713
- Can I come in? - Wait.

293
00:12:45,813 --> 00:12:46,972
Should I leave?

294
00:12:54,553 --> 00:12:55,553
Yes.

295
00:12:56,423 --> 00:12:58,053
- Se Seung. - Yes?

296
00:12:58,183 --> 00:13:00,193
- Can I come in? - Wait.

297
00:13:00,293 --> 00:13:01,492
Should I leave?

298
00:13:06,433 --> 00:13:08,193
Act as if you didn't hear this.

299
00:13:10,703 --> 00:13:12,001
But you told her everything.

300
00:13:12,002 --> 00:13:13,872
Why must she act as if she heard nothing?

301
00:13:14,033 --> 00:13:16,172
- This is killing me. - What is she going to do?

302
00:13:16,173 --> 00:13:17,602
- The popcorn... - Jae Hyung is having fun with this.

303
00:13:19,242 --> 00:13:21,673
How should she act if she has to act as if she didn't hear it?

304
00:13:21,872 --> 00:13:25,413
- But this is an awful timing. - Right. This is so awful!

305
00:13:25,852 --> 00:13:27,252
No, he still has a chance.

306
00:13:31,652 --> 00:13:33,222
Act as if you didn't hear this.

307
00:13:35,762 --> 00:13:37,562
- Can I enter? - My brother is here.

308
00:13:37,563 --> 00:13:38,792
- Is that so? - Is Yun Ha in your room?

309
00:13:38,793 --> 00:13:39,862
No.

310
00:13:41,492 --> 00:13:43,002
- Did you have fun today? - What?

311
00:13:43,033 --> 00:13:44,262
Did you have fun today?

312
00:13:44,402 --> 00:13:46,532
I got a taste of the high life today.

313
00:13:46,533 --> 00:13:48,203
I see. How was it?

314
00:13:49,502 --> 00:13:50,703
It was fun.

315
00:13:50,772 --> 00:13:51,972
- Is that so? - Yes.

316
00:13:59,683 --> 00:14:00,913
It must have been really fun.

317
00:14:03,453 --> 00:14:04,823
- Hey. - What?

318
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:06,793
Did you have fun?

319
00:14:06,992 --> 00:14:09,093
I didn't know what to do.

320
00:14:10,522 --> 00:14:12,163
About my feelings?

321
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:15,862
- I... - Yes.

322
00:14:16,362 --> 00:14:18,463
It said "today."

323
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:22,472
- Did you feel something? - It was about today's date.

324
00:14:23,073 --> 00:14:26,443
Of course, today's date was great.

325
00:14:27,073 --> 00:14:30,083
Cheol Hyeon and I... I also told Cheol Hyeon...

326
00:14:30,413 --> 00:14:33,752
that we weren't just similar or of the same kind.

327
00:14:34,053 --> 00:14:37,382
He and I are exactly the same. He's just like me.

328
00:14:37,622 --> 00:14:38,682
(Trailing off)

329
00:14:38,683 --> 00:14:41,322
So I had a great time with him on the date.

330
00:14:41,323 --> 00:14:42,492
(Raising his tone)

331
00:14:42,722 --> 00:14:45,463
But the thing is that I don't feel attracted...

332
00:14:46,132 --> 00:14:47,991
to someone who's just like me.

333
00:14:47,992 --> 00:14:49,731
We got on the yacht and watched the sunset.

334
00:14:49,732 --> 00:14:52,932
I was getting sentimental to the max on the yacht.

335
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:57,172
And I happened to be with someone who was as sentimental as me.

336
00:14:57,173 --> 00:14:58,173
So it was nice.

337
00:14:58,343 --> 00:15:00,872
- You were on the same wavelength. - Yes. I was grateful for that.

338
00:15:01,112 --> 00:15:02,172
So I sent it to him.

339
00:15:02,173 --> 00:15:06,151
Anyway, when I focused on today, I had a nice time.

340
00:15:06,152 --> 00:15:07,212
So I sent it to him.

341
00:15:07,213 --> 00:15:09,083
- I see. Okay. - It's...

342
00:15:09,622 --> 00:15:10,752
Anyway,

343
00:15:13,693 --> 00:15:15,453
I didn't develop...

344
00:15:16,122 --> 00:15:18,361
any feelings for Cheol Hyeon.

345
00:15:18,362 --> 00:15:19,632
That's not why.

346
00:15:24,163 --> 00:15:25,163
Seriously.

347
00:15:31,002 --> 00:15:32,073
What are you doing tomorrow?

348
00:15:33,343 --> 00:15:34,443
Nothing.

349
00:15:37,982 --> 00:15:39,083
Then...

350
00:15:40,913 --> 00:15:42,053
let's go on a date tomorrow.

351
00:15:49,622 --> 00:15:53,563
(Se Seung doesn't answer him.)

352
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:56,303
Right.

353
00:15:57,663 --> 00:15:58,703
This is scary.

354
00:15:59,772 --> 00:16:02,332
Gosh. Words have such scary power.

355
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:04,202
- Right. It's... - Can you knock me out for a bit?

356
00:16:04,203 --> 00:16:05,303
Really?

357
00:16:05,502 --> 00:16:07,312
I'll allow you to use the stun gun on me...

358
00:16:07,313 --> 00:16:08,913
as long as it's not harmful to my body.

359
00:16:09,612 --> 00:16:10,783
- It's raising my blood pressure. - Let's take a break.

360
00:16:11,882 --> 00:16:17,453
(Se Seung doesn't respond to his date request.)

361
00:16:18,283 --> 00:16:20,891
I was closed off to Jung Sub. So to be honest,

362
00:16:20,892 --> 00:16:23,593
I didn't want to go on a date with him the next day.

363
00:16:23,793 --> 00:16:27,093
But Jung Sub had no idea about what I discovered.

364
00:16:27,163 --> 00:16:28,593
I had to work this out somehow.

365
00:16:28,693 --> 00:16:31,202
But if I were to tell Jung Sub...

366
00:16:31,203 --> 00:16:34,072
about what I heard from Jae Hyung...

367
00:16:34,073 --> 00:16:36,741
which he heard from Cho A,

368
00:16:36,742 --> 00:16:38,501
Cho A and Jae Hyung...

369
00:16:38,502 --> 00:16:39,872
would be in a tight spot.

370
00:16:40,313 --> 00:16:42,413
But I couldn't tell him about what I heard.

371
00:16:44,843 --> 00:16:47,313
Before we went to Gangwon Province,

372
00:16:49,622 --> 00:16:50,683
- why... - Yes.

373
00:16:52,622 --> 00:16:55,422
did you make me feel reassured?

374
00:16:56,422 --> 00:16:57,861
What? Before our trip to Gangwon Province?

375
00:16:57,862 --> 00:17:00,263
Yes. You said I seemed worried.

376
00:17:00,462 --> 00:17:01,992
You told me I had nothing to worry about...

377
00:17:01,993 --> 00:17:03,533
and this was nothing.

378
00:17:04,162 --> 00:17:05,162
Where was this?

379
00:17:05,163 --> 00:17:06,303
On the second floor.

380
00:17:07,372 --> 00:17:10,142
(The night before their trip to Gangwon Province)

381
00:17:10,973 --> 00:17:12,543
(Sighing)

382
00:17:14,642 --> 00:17:16,442
Gosh. This is hard.

383
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:20,152
(Sighing)

384
00:17:20,682 --> 00:17:22,151
- What is it? - What?

385
00:17:22,152 --> 00:17:23,253
Why are you sighing?

386
00:17:23,983 --> 00:17:26,723
- Why are you worried? Don't worry. - What?

387
00:17:27,053 --> 00:17:28,323
I'm not worried.

388
00:17:28,523 --> 00:17:30,592
But you keep sighing like that.

389
00:17:30,593 --> 00:17:32,733
There's so much worry on your face.

390
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:34,392
Really?

391
00:17:34,462 --> 00:17:37,132
Is this complicating your emotions?

392
00:17:37,632 --> 00:17:38,662
No.

393
00:17:39,372 --> 00:17:40,631
(Jung Sub told her not to worry when she seemed to be struggling.)

394
00:17:40,632 --> 00:17:41,872
Don't worry.

395
00:17:43,043 --> 00:17:44,142
Don't worry.

396
00:17:44,872 --> 00:17:46,472
I interpreted that...

397
00:17:46,473 --> 00:17:49,282
as I shouldn't worry about the date because he chose someone...

398
00:17:49,283 --> 00:17:51,983
he wasn't so interested in. That's what I thought.

399
00:17:52,852 --> 00:17:55,052
You said I seemed worried.

400
00:17:55,053 --> 00:17:56,682
Right. You seemed really worried.

401
00:17:57,053 --> 00:18:00,352
You said I didn't have to worry about it. What did you mean by that?

402
00:18:00,593 --> 00:18:04,822
I just thought that you were stressed out...

403
00:18:04,823 --> 00:18:06,092
by what was happening around you...

404
00:18:06,093 --> 00:18:08,062
like other people's action or feelings.

405
00:18:08,063 --> 00:18:09,431
You seemed stressed out.

406
00:18:09,432 --> 00:18:13,573
So it was one of the things I assumed about you.

407
00:18:13,672 --> 00:18:16,542
Usually, people are stressed out by this kind of situation.

408
00:18:16,543 --> 00:18:17,872
Ju Yeon was stressed out in the beginning too.

409
00:18:18,442 --> 00:18:19,612
What are you talking about?

410
00:18:20,073 --> 00:18:21,611
- What? - What are you talking about?

411
00:18:21,612 --> 00:18:24,083
So why did you tell me not to worry?

412
00:18:24,442 --> 00:18:26,782
Well, you seemed...

413
00:18:26,783 --> 00:18:28,752
stressed out...

414
00:18:28,753 --> 00:18:31,253
because of other people's feelings. That's how it looked to me.

415
00:18:31,882 --> 00:18:33,823
- That's what you meant? - Yes.

416
00:18:36,023 --> 00:18:38,122
That's what you meant.

417
00:18:38,192 --> 00:18:39,233
Yes.

418
00:18:42,392 --> 00:18:43,563
What are you talking about?

419
00:18:44,662 --> 00:18:47,033
I see. That's what you meant.

420
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:51,503
I was just telling you not to worry.

421
00:18:52,202 --> 00:18:55,473
He just told me not to worry in the most general sense.

422
00:18:55,712 --> 00:18:58,682
He wasn't trying to reassure me.

423
00:18:58,912 --> 00:19:01,381
He just meant that I shouldn't care too much...

424
00:19:01,382 --> 00:19:04,023
about who texted whom or so on. That's all he meant.

425
00:19:04,922 --> 00:19:06,851
After hearing his answer, I realized that...

426
00:19:06,852 --> 00:19:09,691
everything I was feeling was my misunderstanding.

427
00:19:09,692 --> 00:19:10,892
At least, what I felt in the beginning.

428
00:19:12,362 --> 00:19:14,592
By the way, when you tell someone not to worry,

429
00:19:14,593 --> 00:19:16,202
how else could you interpret that?

430
00:19:16,402 --> 00:19:17,661
Here's an example.

431
00:19:17,662 --> 00:19:21,072
Let's say I'm standing guard at the post with a private.

432
00:19:21,073 --> 00:19:23,402
But he keeps sighing like this.

433
00:19:23,473 --> 00:19:25,302
Actually, I don't know what he's worried about.

434
00:19:25,303 --> 00:19:27,542
"Don't worry. Everything will turn out well."

435
00:19:27,543 --> 00:19:29,582
He probably did something like that to Se Seung.

436
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:31,012
Then how would he respond?

437
00:19:31,013 --> 00:19:32,411
"Yes, sir." His superior was telling him so.

438
00:19:32,412 --> 00:19:33,753
That's the only answer he can say.

439
00:19:35,852 --> 00:19:37,323
- That's the only answer. - Right.

440
00:19:39,823 --> 00:19:42,053
- Are you sleeping? - No.

441
00:19:43,523 --> 00:19:45,861
(Dispirited)

442
00:19:45,862 --> 00:19:46,932
Yes.

443
00:19:47,263 --> 00:19:48,862
- Are you here? - Yes.

444
00:19:49,093 --> 00:19:50,802
I need to talk to you about something serious.

445
00:19:50,803 --> 00:19:52,361
Wait. Can we do this in a bit?

446
00:19:52,362 --> 00:19:54,232
I was joking. Can I use the bathroom?

447
00:19:54,233 --> 00:19:55,372
Go ahead.

448
00:19:56,442 --> 00:19:57,602
I was joking.

449
00:19:58,202 --> 00:20:01,912
(Regardless of what's happening, Se Seung is confused.)

450
00:20:04,142 --> 00:20:06,512
You told me you became curious about the past...

451
00:20:06,513 --> 00:20:08,483
and the past became important.

452
00:20:08,783 --> 00:20:11,253
- Yes. - How much of the past do you mean?

453
00:20:11,422 --> 00:20:12,691
My old relationships?

454
00:20:12,692 --> 00:20:15,952
The life before you met me.

455
00:20:16,422 --> 00:20:18,063
- I see. - I guess your old relationships...

456
00:20:18,563 --> 00:20:20,763
would be good to know.

457
00:20:21,192 --> 00:20:24,802
Then you didn't say it in a negative tone.

458
00:20:24,803 --> 00:20:25,962
Then...

459
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:29,132
why did you make it sound so serious?

460
00:20:29,202 --> 00:20:31,743
Sorry. I tend to do that when I talk.

461
00:20:32,172 --> 00:20:33,273
So everyone gets the wrong idea.

462
00:20:34,043 --> 00:20:36,243
- Thanks. Bye. - Okay.

463
00:20:37,543 --> 00:20:40,082
So I was like, "What does he mean?"

464
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:42,381
You seemed... How should I say it?

465
00:20:42,382 --> 00:20:44,482
You seemed you were in a bad mood or something.

466
00:20:44,483 --> 00:20:47,151
By the way, I tend to make things sound too serious...

467
00:20:47,152 --> 00:20:49,493
when they're nothing.

468
00:20:49,763 --> 00:20:52,323
That flusters people a lot.

469
00:20:56,932 --> 00:21:00,273
If you don't want to go on a date, you can just tell me so.

470
00:21:03,872 --> 00:21:05,743
I'm not sure about your feelings now.

471
00:21:12,343 --> 00:21:14,382
Se Seung seemed really unhappy.

472
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:18,522
All of a sudden,

473
00:21:18,523 --> 00:21:21,293
she started a serious conversation with me.

474
00:21:24,823 --> 00:21:25,922
I...

475
00:21:26,632 --> 00:21:30,503
The direction of my interest had always been the same.

476
00:21:30,632 --> 00:21:33,401
I think I'm still trying to figure out...

477
00:21:33,402 --> 00:21:34,573
if this is right or not.

478
00:21:36,973 --> 00:21:40,072
This sort of made me hesitate.

479
00:21:40,073 --> 00:21:43,742
In the very beginning... When we just started filming,

480
00:21:43,743 --> 00:21:46,451
I thought your action made your intention clear to me.

481
00:21:46,452 --> 00:21:48,212
But you said it wasn't true.

482
00:21:48,852 --> 00:21:52,722
It made me think that you were the type of person...

483
00:21:52,723 --> 00:21:55,891
who would behave in that way when you weren't certain...

484
00:21:55,892 --> 00:21:57,263
about your feelings yet.

485
00:21:57,723 --> 00:22:00,533
It made me think that you could have done the same...

486
00:22:01,462 --> 00:22:04,003
- to other people, not just me. - What's this? Are you copying me?

487
00:22:04,432 --> 00:22:05,462
What?

488
00:22:05,962 --> 00:22:08,602
Didn't I tell you the same thing?

489
00:22:14,813 --> 00:22:17,111
Well, when I interact with other people,

490
00:22:17,112 --> 00:22:19,342
I may come across as kind.

491
00:22:19,343 --> 00:22:22,012
No. I'm talking about when you go on a date with other people.

492
00:22:22,013 --> 00:22:23,552
- Right. On dates. - It made me think that...

493
00:22:23,553 --> 00:22:25,121
you might have behaved the same way...

494
00:22:25,122 --> 00:22:27,553
or been as expressive as when you were with me.

495
00:22:27,753 --> 00:22:31,722
Of course, I behaved differently on dates with other people.

496
00:22:31,723 --> 00:22:33,661
I treated them nicely.

497
00:22:33,662 --> 00:22:36,833
I tried to be a gentleman to everyone.

498
00:22:38,202 --> 00:22:40,171
But there weren't moments like "What's this?"

499
00:22:40,172 --> 00:22:44,702
The dates didn't pass the point of becoming romantic or anything.

500
00:22:45,973 --> 00:22:47,043
None of them were like that.

501
00:22:48,672 --> 00:22:49,982
If I had to pick a date that got close,

502
00:22:49,983 --> 00:22:51,283
it would be the one with Cho A.

503
00:22:52,442 --> 00:22:53,451
(Startled)

504
00:22:53,452 --> 00:22:54,712
(Screaming)

505
00:22:55,852 --> 00:22:57,552
- He said it. Right. - I... Gosh.

506
00:22:57,553 --> 00:22:59,891
It's better to talk about it. Right?

507
00:22:59,892 --> 00:23:02,152
- No. Bringing it up now is like... - Gosh. This...

508
00:23:02,392 --> 00:23:03,762
- confirming everything as true. - He just confirmed everything.

509
00:23:03,763 --> 00:23:04,793
Yes.

510
00:23:05,263 --> 00:23:07,931
Out of the ten participants in the house,

511
00:23:07,932 --> 00:23:09,931
when it comes to using verbal communication efficiently,

512
00:23:09,932 --> 00:23:11,601
- Se Seung is the best at it. - Right.

513
00:23:11,602 --> 00:23:12,602
I agree.

514
00:23:12,603 --> 00:23:14,002
- No one can beat her. - You can't beat her.

515
00:23:14,003 --> 00:23:15,631
If he was going to name Cho A, he should've said,

516
00:23:15,632 --> 00:23:17,872
"What was her name? Was it Cho A?" He should've done that.

517
00:23:19,973 --> 00:23:21,211
- What was that? - He should...

518
00:23:21,212 --> 00:23:22,773
- Oh, no. - Gosh. Seriously.

519
00:23:22,882 --> 00:23:23,941
He really named her.

520
00:23:23,942 --> 00:23:25,012
I'm so curious about...

521
00:23:25,013 --> 00:23:26,111
- what happens next. - "If I had to pick, it'd be Cho A."

522
00:23:26,112 --> 00:23:27,112
- How will she react? - Please.

523
00:23:27,313 --> 00:23:28,552
If I had to pick a date that got close,

524
00:23:28,553 --> 00:23:29,823
it would be the one with Cho A.

525
00:23:31,223 --> 00:23:32,783
What about the date with her?

526
00:23:33,293 --> 00:23:34,952
Well, as for...

527
00:23:35,553 --> 00:23:37,461
moments I express my interest clearly...

528
00:23:37,462 --> 00:23:39,361
or any similar moments like that...

529
00:23:39,362 --> 00:23:41,063
You didn't express anything to her?

530
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:46,702
Well...

531
00:23:47,533 --> 00:23:49,642
"I love you."

532
00:23:51,803 --> 00:23:54,072
If you're asking me whether or not...

533
00:23:54,073 --> 00:23:55,312
I gave her assurance by saying stuff like that,

534
00:23:55,313 --> 00:23:56,313
I didn't do that.

535
00:23:56,314 --> 00:23:57,782
Then...

536
00:23:57,783 --> 00:24:00,552
you were curious about Cho A and wanted to get to know her.

537
00:24:00,553 --> 00:24:02,651
Yes. I was curious about her.

538
00:24:02,652 --> 00:24:04,951
But I thought that you were going to Gangwon Province...

539
00:24:04,952 --> 00:24:06,351
with someone you weren't interested in.

540
00:24:06,352 --> 00:24:07,352
I see.

541
00:24:07,353 --> 00:24:08,851
But later, I found out...

542
00:24:08,852 --> 00:24:11,793
that you weren't sure about me in the beginning.

543
00:24:12,122 --> 00:24:15,131
And when you told me not to worry before the trip to Gangwon Province,

544
00:24:15,132 --> 00:24:17,832
the intention behind that wasn't how I interpreted it.

545
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:20,973
On top of that, you were curious about Cho A.

546
00:24:21,303 --> 00:24:23,472
You worked hard to win her over,

547
00:24:23,473 --> 00:24:26,002
but you didn't get a message from her, so you had a hard time.

548
00:24:26,003 --> 00:24:27,043
Yes.

549
00:24:27,473 --> 00:24:28,542
Then...

550
00:24:28,543 --> 00:24:30,911
all the feelings I had for you...

551
00:24:30,912 --> 00:24:31,912
- in the beginning... - Yes.

552
00:24:32,543 --> 00:24:34,813
were completely off.

553
00:24:36,152 --> 00:24:40,622
So I don't think I can trust...

554
00:24:41,622 --> 00:24:44,492
It will be difficult to build trust. That crossed my mind.

555
00:24:44,493 --> 00:24:45,762
(Thinking)

556
00:24:45,763 --> 00:24:48,733
Everything I thought was a complete misunderstanding.

557
00:24:54,202 --> 00:24:56,542
Se Seung thought that...

558
00:24:56,543 --> 00:25:00,911
I made my stance very clear from the beginning.

559
00:25:00,912 --> 00:25:03,111
But I told her I was getting to know everyone...

560
00:25:03,112 --> 00:25:05,441
and my interest for her was growing.

561
00:25:05,442 --> 00:25:06,881
That's what I said.

562
00:25:06,882 --> 00:25:10,622
But she said everything she felt was completely off.

563
00:25:10,753 --> 00:25:13,651
So she couldn't trust me. That's what she said.

564
00:25:13,652 --> 00:25:16,151
Not having any trust is a huge problem...

565
00:25:16,152 --> 00:25:18,292
in relationships.

566
00:25:18,293 --> 00:25:20,033
After hearing that,

567
00:25:20,293 --> 00:25:24,702
I realized that Se Seung was trying...

568
00:25:25,632 --> 00:25:27,532
to push me away.

569
00:25:27,533 --> 00:25:29,702
I felt that she was trying...

570
00:25:29,942 --> 00:25:32,672
to cut me out of her heart.

571
00:25:33,743 --> 00:25:37,783
So you're basically telling me you can't trust me.

572
00:25:40,753 --> 00:25:42,182
That's it, right?

573
00:25:42,813 --> 00:25:45,951
(Trailing off)

574
00:25:45,952 --> 00:25:48,152
You were thinking the opposite.

575
00:25:49,253 --> 00:25:50,792
(Trailing off)

576
00:25:50,793 --> 00:25:51,993
Okay. I see.

577
00:25:53,263 --> 00:25:55,362
Having trust is very important.

578
00:26:02,172 --> 00:26:04,672
I understood what you said. I got it.

579
00:26:06,142 --> 00:26:08,412
I don't think you understood it correctly.

580
00:26:08,612 --> 00:26:09,983
I think I did.

581
00:26:10,882 --> 00:26:13,012
You're telling me my action didn't match...

582
00:26:13,013 --> 00:26:15,782
what you thought of me so far.

583
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:17,622
And it was the total opposite.

584
00:26:20,922 --> 00:26:23,162
I was a bit angry too.

585
00:26:24,462 --> 00:26:25,892
Here's how I felt.

586
00:26:25,962 --> 00:26:28,162
It felt as if she was making a hasty decision.

587
00:26:28,432 --> 00:26:31,161
She could have genuinely asked me to find out what happened.

588
00:26:31,162 --> 00:26:33,032
But without talking to me first,

589
00:26:33,033 --> 00:26:35,332
she already sorted out her feelings.

590
00:26:35,333 --> 00:26:38,802
She was done judging me and decided what to do with me.

591
00:26:38,803 --> 00:26:42,111
It seemed as if she didn't have anything else to say to me.

592
00:26:42,112 --> 00:26:44,582
That's how I felt from her attitude.

593
00:26:44,583 --> 00:26:47,053
Suddenly, I got angry.

594
00:27:01,593 --> 00:27:02,892
It's confusing.

595
00:27:05,303 --> 00:27:08,473
All the feelings I experienced while spending time with you...

596
00:27:09,102 --> 00:27:11,073
feel like all lies right now.

597
00:27:17,783 --> 00:27:19,882
This is really hard to describe.

598
00:27:21,452 --> 00:27:22,483
Try it.

599
00:27:25,922 --> 00:27:27,223
To be honest,

600
00:27:27,652 --> 00:27:29,692
I wanted him to comfort me.

601
00:27:29,892 --> 00:27:32,562
I expressed that I didn't want to go on a date with him.

602
00:27:32,563 --> 00:27:34,191
But I hoped he would comfort me...

603
00:27:34,192 --> 00:27:36,033
and say things like, "It's not true."

604
00:27:37,862 --> 00:27:39,563
You know, I want...

605
00:27:39,662 --> 00:27:42,502
to tell you exactly how I felt and why I behaved that way.

606
00:27:42,503 --> 00:27:44,701
I want to explain everything in great detail.

607
00:27:44,702 --> 00:27:48,573
But I'm not sure exactly which incident you're referring to.

608
00:27:49,043 --> 00:27:50,542
But I can say this for certain.

609
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:53,451
When I first met you,

610
00:27:53,452 --> 00:27:55,983
I started with simple curiosity that I wanted to get to know you.

611
00:27:56,212 --> 00:27:57,852
And that got me here.

612
00:27:58,253 --> 00:27:59,992
But it was the opposite for you.

613
00:27:59,993 --> 00:28:02,151
You were certain about me in the beginning,

614
00:28:02,152 --> 00:28:03,493
but you're losing faith now.

615
00:28:03,823 --> 00:28:08,462
Because your trust in me is weakening,

616
00:28:09,033 --> 00:28:12,233
you might misinterpret what I say against my intention.

617
00:28:13,503 --> 00:28:14,733
I don't know.

618
00:28:15,773 --> 00:28:18,043
When I think about our 1st and 2nd dates...

619
00:28:19,273 --> 00:28:20,343
and our trip to the airport,

620
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:24,513
I only have good memories from these dates, looking back.

621
00:28:34,622 --> 00:28:35,922
What do you want me to do?

622
00:28:45,662 --> 00:28:47,333
It must be tough for you too.

623
00:29:03,013 --> 00:29:04,582
(Sighing)

624
00:29:04,583 --> 00:29:06,152
This is making me dizzy.

625
00:29:06,823 --> 00:29:07,993
This is...

626
00:29:08,323 --> 00:29:10,523
She didn't mean that.

627
00:29:10,763 --> 00:29:13,562
She can't say anything now because it would hurt her pride.

628
00:29:13,563 --> 00:29:14,961
I bet they'll get soft again.

629
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:17,532
- Right. But... - These two will.

630
00:29:17,533 --> 00:29:19,162
she just destroyed him with facts.

631
00:29:19,462 --> 00:29:21,432
It's like they're breaking up.

632
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:29,243
Why are you on my bed?

633
00:29:32,343 --> 00:29:33,412
Get out.

634
00:29:36,852 --> 00:29:38,182
Okay. I got it.

635
00:29:43,793 --> 00:29:46,362
When I was getting to know people one at a time,

636
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:50,802
I was trying to see if I clicked with them.

637
00:29:50,803 --> 00:29:53,872
It was my way of figuring out the right person for me.

638
00:29:54,503 --> 00:29:58,402
So I was looking forward to spending time with other people and so on.

639
00:29:58,573 --> 00:30:02,141
At the end of this process,

640
00:30:02,142 --> 00:30:06,782
the person I continued to like and have good feelings for was you.

641
00:30:06,783 --> 00:30:08,083
You were that person for me.

642
00:30:10,553 --> 00:30:13,652
But it feels like you're purposely trying...

643
00:30:14,223 --> 00:30:16,023
to find reasons why I'm not a good guy for you...

644
00:30:16,293 --> 00:30:18,692
ever since we arrived in Singapore.

645
00:30:20,662 --> 00:30:22,993
It feels like you're trying to find faults.

646
00:30:23,763 --> 00:30:26,503
That's how your action seems in my eyes.

647
00:30:30,602 --> 00:30:31,702
Right.

648
00:30:42,112 --> 00:30:44,323
Gosh. You startled me.

649
00:30:50,023 --> 00:30:51,162
She startled me.

650
00:30:51,223 --> 00:30:52,391
- Bingo. - He likes it.

651
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:53,592
- What's going on? - He likes it.

652
00:30:53,593 --> 00:30:55,593
- They like each other a lot. - Right.

653
00:30:55,733 --> 00:30:57,432
As long as they like each other, they'll end up together.

654
00:30:57,733 --> 00:30:59,402
- Gosh. So much. - They like each other so much.

655
00:31:00,003 --> 00:31:01,372
(Gosh. You startled me.)

656
00:31:05,043 --> 00:31:06,843
I think you're right.

657
00:31:09,212 --> 00:31:10,283
I'm sorry.

658
00:31:10,642 --> 00:31:12,043
- What was that? - Get out of here.

659
00:31:12,343 --> 00:31:14,652
- Sorry! They drive me crazy. - Yes! Okay.

660
00:31:15,682 --> 00:31:16,782
(Passing out for the 2nd time)

661
00:31:16,783 --> 00:31:18,583
- What are they doing? - Yes.

662
00:31:18,652 --> 00:31:20,592
- If this is love, I won't be in it. - By the way,

663
00:31:20,593 --> 00:31:21,793
love is...

664
00:31:23,422 --> 00:31:25,422
MIYEON. You can't fall in love anyway, right?

665
00:31:26,763 --> 00:31:28,292
- I can't fall in love anyway. - Right?

666
00:31:28,293 --> 00:31:29,992
- Later in the future. - Later.

667
00:31:29,993 --> 00:31:32,101
- Later. - Later.

668
00:31:32,102 --> 00:31:33,631
I thought she meant now.

669
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:35,303
- Gosh. That's after 30 years. - Later in the future.

670
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:38,272
- Gosh. It's so heart-fluttering. - Anyway...

671
00:31:38,273 --> 00:31:39,302
It made my heart flutter indeed.

672
00:31:39,303 --> 00:31:41,042
Can we watch it again? From when she moved to his bed?

673
00:31:41,043 --> 00:31:43,312
Gosh. This is crazy. Seriously.

674
00:31:43,313 --> 00:31:44,483
I thought she was leaving.

675
00:31:44,642 --> 00:31:46,343
I mean, she was facing the door too.

676
00:31:55,323 --> 00:31:57,422
Gosh. You startled me.

677
00:32:02,162 --> 00:32:04,063
I think you're right.

678
00:32:06,162 --> 00:32:07,233
I'm sorry.

679
00:32:08,202 --> 00:32:10,973
- Get out of here. - I'm really sorry.

680
00:32:12,442 --> 00:32:13,712
At that moment,

681
00:32:13,773 --> 00:32:16,572
I realized that everything Jung Sub said was true.

682
00:32:16,573 --> 00:32:18,441
I jumped to conclusions.

683
00:32:18,442 --> 00:32:20,381
But I was insecure when my feelings grew bigger.

684
00:32:20,382 --> 00:32:22,982
I started to find faults to justify...

685
00:32:22,983 --> 00:32:25,323
my attempt at trying to dismiss my feelings.

686
00:32:26,452 --> 00:32:28,792
I think tomorrow's date will be really fun.

687
00:32:28,793 --> 00:32:31,161
Wait. Because you got to go on that luxurious date,

688
00:32:31,162 --> 00:32:33,692
do you not have any regrets? So do you not care about the date?

689
00:32:34,362 --> 00:32:36,762
- Because you were on a yacht... - Jung Sub, I'm sorry.

690
00:32:36,763 --> 00:32:38,361
- Because you were on a yacht... - I'm sorry.

691
00:32:38,362 --> 00:32:40,302
- Because you were on a yacht, - Let's go on a date.

692
00:32:40,303 --> 00:32:41,702
- you don't want this date? - Let's go on a date.

693
00:32:41,773 --> 00:32:43,773
We should go on a date.

694
00:32:44,473 --> 00:32:46,871
I'm shocked by what you just told me.

695
00:32:46,872 --> 00:32:48,812
What? I don't know.

696
00:32:48,813 --> 00:32:51,381
Your attitude toward me this morning...

697
00:32:51,382 --> 00:32:53,851
or up until you went on your date today was so different.

698
00:32:53,852 --> 00:32:58,252
But the conversation we're having now is completely different.

699
00:32:58,253 --> 00:32:59,753
It's a different kind of conversation.

700
00:33:00,053 --> 00:33:01,622
The seriousness had changed too.

701
00:33:01,692 --> 00:33:04,622
I really thought that you had a change of heart.

702
00:33:04,862 --> 00:33:06,192
Or...

703
00:33:06,723 --> 00:33:09,233
you finished judging me...

704
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:11,032
in your own way.

705
00:33:11,033 --> 00:33:12,932
- No. - You did.

706
00:33:15,303 --> 00:33:16,671
(Sighing)

707
00:33:16,672 --> 00:33:18,342
What? Do you have to go somewhere?

708
00:33:18,343 --> 00:33:19,442
No.

709
00:33:21,172 --> 00:33:22,172
What is it?

710
00:33:22,543 --> 00:33:24,142
No. I just...

711
00:33:24,743 --> 00:33:27,712
ended up doing that. I...

712
00:33:28,152 --> 00:33:30,223
But thank you for coming here.

713
00:33:31,823 --> 00:33:34,293
If I were you, I couldn't have done what you did.

714
00:33:34,493 --> 00:33:35,852
What did I do exactly?

715
00:33:36,023 --> 00:33:37,323
You came to my bed.

716
00:33:38,362 --> 00:33:39,662
I could never do that.

717
00:33:41,093 --> 00:33:42,891
- That was huge. - She was so cute.

718
00:33:42,892 --> 00:33:44,201
- It's like crossing the river. - Seriously.

719
00:33:44,202 --> 00:33:45,732
It's equivalent to the first step...

720
00:33:45,733 --> 00:33:47,232
- Columbus took. - It's like discovering a new world!

721
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:48,532
- It's like landing on the moon. - Right.

722
00:33:48,533 --> 00:33:49,772
- She landed on the bed. - I think Se Seung...

723
00:33:49,773 --> 00:33:51,671
- naturally moved toward him. - Seriously.

724
00:33:51,672 --> 00:33:53,401
- I'm happy. Congratulations. - Congratulations.

725
00:33:53,402 --> 00:33:55,773
Anyway, it's fine as long as they're happy.

726
00:33:56,112 --> 00:33:57,711
The fact that she could bring this up first...

727
00:33:57,712 --> 00:33:59,581
was really cool of her.

728
00:33:59,582 --> 00:34:01,611
She reached out to me first.

729
00:34:01,612 --> 00:34:03,752
I was grateful for that.

730
00:34:04,652 --> 00:34:06,123
(Scowling)

731
00:34:06,993 --> 00:34:08,053
What?

732
00:34:09,453 --> 00:34:10,823
Can I slap you just once?

733
00:34:11,663 --> 00:34:12,823
Go ahead.

734
00:34:13,462 --> 00:34:16,132
You're so annoying! Seriously.

735
00:34:20,033 --> 00:34:22,203
Gosh. Lee Jung Sub. I hate you the most.

736
00:34:26,542 --> 00:34:28,373
Hey, no.

737
00:34:31,183 --> 00:34:33,512
- No. - Let me lie down too.

738
00:34:33,513 --> 00:34:34,553
Fine. Go ahead.

739
00:34:36,922 --> 00:34:39,152
It's confirmed that we'll go on a date at noon.

740
00:34:40,223 --> 00:34:41,422
What do you want to do?

741
00:34:43,022 --> 00:34:46,692
I don't know. Going to a nice place sounds good.

742
00:34:47,832 --> 00:34:50,062
Hey, I don't think you should be here.

743
00:34:50,703 --> 00:34:51,803
Don't you know...

744
00:34:54,033 --> 00:34:55,632
boys and girls can't share beds once they turn seven?

745
00:35:02,143 --> 00:35:04,382
(Meanwhile, Yun Jae goes up to his room.)

746
00:35:30,973 --> 00:35:34,143
(He takes off the bracelet he bought with Ju Yeon.)

747
00:35:50,522 --> 00:35:51,961
I...

748
00:35:51,962 --> 00:35:52,993
(Glancing)

749
00:35:54,533 --> 00:35:56,562
So that's... I mean...

750
00:36:19,922 --> 00:36:22,592
They were so solid for the past two weeks.

751
00:36:22,593 --> 00:36:24,961
But Yong Woo just declared that he was neutral.

752
00:36:24,962 --> 00:36:26,921
He just announced that he was free. He's a free agent now.

753
00:36:26,922 --> 00:36:27,962
Okay.

754
00:36:28,033 --> 00:36:30,402
"Okay. You're a free agent? I'll go for it."

755
00:36:30,803 --> 00:36:32,402
I might do the same too.

756
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:57,393
What do I do?

757
00:37:10,402 --> 00:37:11,842
Lots of thoughts went through my head.

758
00:37:11,843 --> 00:37:13,912
I thought I didn't receive a text from Yun Ha...

759
00:37:13,913 --> 00:37:16,343
because of the date she went with Yong Woo...

760
00:37:16,573 --> 00:37:19,442
and that I should've done better...

761
00:37:20,143 --> 00:37:22,712
to prevent her from changing her mind.

762
00:37:22,953 --> 00:37:24,722
Those thoughts made me blame myself.

763
00:37:24,723 --> 00:37:28,252
I felt that I couldn't bear the situation.

764
00:37:51,283 --> 00:37:52,413
Is he crying?

765
00:37:53,343 --> 00:37:54,912
Oh, dear. He's crying.

766
00:37:54,913 --> 00:37:55,913
Really?

767
00:37:56,183 --> 00:37:57,823
- It's enough to make you cry. - He's crying.

768
00:37:57,953 --> 00:38:00,521
The moment Yong Woo declared that he was a free agent,

769
00:38:00,522 --> 00:38:02,323
it was all over.

770
00:38:03,692 --> 00:38:05,263
I hate this.

771
00:38:18,502 --> 00:38:20,573
(Yong Woo came to see him.)

772
00:38:21,413 --> 00:38:22,742
- Yun Jae? - Yes.

773
00:38:22,743 --> 00:38:23,812
What are you doing?

774
00:38:24,442 --> 00:38:25,482
Gosh, Yong Woo.

775
00:38:25,683 --> 00:38:26,743
- No. - My goodness.

776
00:38:26,913 --> 00:38:28,882
What? What is he doing here?

777
00:38:29,513 --> 00:38:31,683
(Yong Woo came to see him.)

778
00:38:32,422 --> 00:38:33,751
- Yun Jae? - Yes.

779
00:38:33,752 --> 00:38:34,853
What are you doing?

780
00:38:35,453 --> 00:38:36,522
Gosh, Yong Woo.

781
00:38:36,752 --> 00:38:37,823
- No. - My goodness.

782
00:38:38,022 --> 00:38:39,861
What? What is he doing here?

783
00:38:39,862 --> 00:38:41,162
- You should wipe your tears. - I mean...

784
00:38:41,163 --> 00:38:42,163
I knew it.

785
00:38:42,164 --> 00:38:43,831
- Did he come while he was in tears? - The composure of the chosen.

786
00:38:43,832 --> 00:38:45,331
- He should wipe away his tears. - Gosh.

787
00:38:45,332 --> 00:38:46,561
- What is going on... - "What are you doing, Yun Jae?"

788
00:38:46,562 --> 00:38:48,072
at that house today?

789
00:38:48,073 --> 00:38:50,132
- That's bad timing. - "Come down. Let's drink together."

790
00:38:50,873 --> 00:38:52,202
- Yun Jae? - Yes.

791
00:38:52,203 --> 00:38:53,343
What are you doing?

792
00:38:53,913 --> 00:38:55,042
Why are you drinking alone?

793
00:38:56,442 --> 00:38:57,982
- Are you with someone? - No.

794
00:38:59,183 --> 00:39:00,712
Why are you drinking solo?

795
00:39:01,382 --> 00:39:03,283
- I don't feel good today. - Why?

796
00:39:07,152 --> 00:39:08,993
- I know. - Why don't you feel good?

797
00:39:12,462 --> 00:39:14,033
(Groaning)

798
00:39:18,232 --> 00:39:19,632
It looks like we're in similar situations.

799
00:39:20,303 --> 00:39:21,502
What? How?

800
00:39:23,803 --> 00:39:26,303
I'm thankful for Yun Ha today.

801
00:39:26,902 --> 00:39:28,912
We talked a lot while spending the whole day together.

802
00:39:28,913 --> 00:39:31,183
I shared a lot with her about what I truly felt.

803
00:39:33,712 --> 00:39:35,783
Thanks to her today,

804
00:39:38,323 --> 00:39:40,123
I've shifted to a neutral stance for the first time.

805
00:39:41,723 --> 00:39:43,322
That was a little hard for me.

806
00:39:43,323 --> 00:39:44,623
(Well...)

807
00:39:47,993 --> 00:39:49,961
Yun Jae always drank with us...

808
00:39:49,962 --> 00:39:52,162
and spent time with the group while drinking.

809
00:39:52,163 --> 00:39:55,772
Yesterday was the only day he was drinking alone.

810
00:39:56,433 --> 00:39:58,271
I wondered what happened to him.

811
00:39:58,272 --> 00:40:01,772
One of the reasons why I wanted to talk to him was...

812
00:40:02,212 --> 00:40:04,343
that I wanted to ease his mind.

813
00:40:04,582 --> 00:40:06,212
"After my date with Yun Ha,"

814
00:40:06,513 --> 00:40:08,611
"I didn't change my mind to pursue her..."

815
00:40:08,612 --> 00:40:11,481
"or to cause you any trouble."

816
00:40:11,482 --> 00:40:12,953
I wanted to subtly tell him that.

817
00:40:13,082 --> 00:40:14,352
I'm thankful for Yun Ha...

818
00:40:14,353 --> 00:40:16,453
because she helped me organize my thoughts...

819
00:40:16,953 --> 00:40:18,962
like a counselling psychologist.

820
00:40:19,362 --> 00:40:21,933
So I texted Yun Ha to thank her for today.

821
00:40:23,132 --> 00:40:24,433
Well, I'm into Yun Ha.

822
00:40:25,232 --> 00:40:26,702
I assume everyone knows, but I like her.

823
00:40:26,703 --> 00:40:28,132
- You two look good together. - What?

824
00:40:28,502 --> 00:40:29,533
You two look cute together.

825
00:40:29,933 --> 00:40:31,843
I'll go for Yun Ha.

826
00:40:32,243 --> 00:40:34,013
Even if she rejects me, I can't do anything.

827
00:40:34,612 --> 00:40:36,372
I know how to handle rejection when it happens to me,

828
00:40:36,373 --> 00:40:39,541
but it's tough when I'm the one doing the rejecting.

829
00:40:39,542 --> 00:40:42,453
I did receive a text from Ju Yeon.

830
00:40:43,212 --> 00:40:44,953
Ju Yeon said I reminded her of Chipmunk.

831
00:40:45,453 --> 00:40:47,692
- Chip? - Chipmunk.

832
00:40:48,692 --> 00:40:49,722
(Yong Woo doesn't know what the text was about.)

833
00:40:49,723 --> 00:40:51,292
- Right, rejecting is harder. - Yes.

834
00:40:51,993 --> 00:40:53,123
Why is he talking about Ju Yeon all of a sudden?

835
00:40:55,962 --> 00:40:58,062
Why are they suddenly talking about that?

836
00:40:58,763 --> 00:41:01,203
- I hoped she didn't text me. - Really?

837
00:41:02,373 --> 00:41:05,143
- I hoped she didn't. - Right. I understand.

838
00:41:05,502 --> 00:41:07,312
Yun Jae's point was...

839
00:41:07,542 --> 00:41:09,373
that rejecting was hard for him.

840
00:41:09,973 --> 00:41:12,182
I guess she had fun spending time with you today.

841
00:41:12,183 --> 00:41:15,512
She might've texted you to thank you.

842
00:41:15,513 --> 00:41:18,053
You don't have to think too much about it.

843
00:41:18,752 --> 00:41:20,751
Not receiving a text from Yun Ha...

844
00:41:20,752 --> 00:41:22,752
did break my heart.

845
00:41:22,953 --> 00:41:25,862
But I chose Ju Yeon as my date.

846
00:41:26,323 --> 00:41:28,362
I was rejected by Yun Ha and felt sad,

847
00:41:28,533 --> 00:41:31,632
and I rejected someone too.

848
00:41:31,832 --> 00:41:33,462
I felt so bad about that.

849
00:41:33,703 --> 00:41:35,433
I spent time with Ju Yeon today...

850
00:41:36,703 --> 00:41:38,171
You don't have to...

851
00:41:38,172 --> 00:41:40,573
keep thinking about that and feeling bad.

852
00:41:43,812 --> 00:41:45,282
- Cho A. - Yes.

853
00:41:45,283 --> 00:41:46,343
What's up?

854
00:41:46,612 --> 00:41:48,152
- Do you want to talk outside? - Shall we?

855
00:41:48,453 --> 00:41:50,112
(Se Seung wants to talk to Cho A.)

856
00:41:50,513 --> 00:41:52,352
You've gone on a date with Jung Sub.

857
00:41:52,353 --> 00:41:54,521
- Yes. - I think he treated you...

858
00:41:54,522 --> 00:41:55,722
the same way he did with me.

859
00:41:55,723 --> 00:41:57,893
That's still confusing to me.

860
00:41:59,422 --> 00:42:01,561
Can you tell me what he said specifically?

861
00:42:01,562 --> 00:42:03,232
I want to compare.

862
00:42:03,862 --> 00:42:05,961
I understand...

863
00:42:05,962 --> 00:42:09,672
that he is good at expressing likes and dislikes.

864
00:42:09,933 --> 00:42:12,271
He mentioned his first impression of me...

865
00:42:12,272 --> 00:42:14,372
or the things he liked about me...

866
00:42:14,373 --> 00:42:16,711
- throughout the conversation. - He kept mentioning that?

867
00:42:16,712 --> 00:42:17,743
Yes. So...

868
00:42:18,013 --> 00:42:20,513
I wondered if he was just good...

869
00:42:20,783 --> 00:42:22,251
at complimenting.

870
00:42:22,252 --> 00:42:25,122
I think that's his charm.

871
00:42:25,123 --> 00:42:27,493
That he can express his thoughts about you like that.

872
00:42:27,752 --> 00:42:30,961
He's really good at noticing the good qualities in others...

873
00:42:30,962 --> 00:42:35,263
and acknowledging them whenever he notices them.

874
00:42:35,462 --> 00:42:37,631
I thought he was really considerate.

875
00:42:37,632 --> 00:42:40,402
He kept saying he didn't know how he felt about me.

876
00:42:41,033 --> 00:42:43,772
From what I think, if he put it that way,

877
00:42:44,343 --> 00:42:47,203
he was saying he wanted to get...

878
00:42:47,343 --> 00:42:49,612
- more attention from you. - Give him more attention?

879
00:42:49,973 --> 00:42:53,913
That's why I think this relationship could really go somewhere positive.

880
00:42:54,082 --> 00:42:57,822
It's starting off with affection as its foundation.

881
00:42:57,823 --> 00:42:59,683
He said he was upset because he cared for you.

882
00:42:59,783 --> 00:43:03,521
To me, that seems like he's making an effort.

883
00:43:03,522 --> 00:43:04,522
Right.

884
00:43:06,223 --> 00:43:07,292
- I see. - Yes.

885
00:43:07,533 --> 00:43:09,192
Thank you for sorting that out for me.

886
00:43:10,062 --> 00:43:12,731
I felt like all the pieces of the conversations...

887
00:43:12,732 --> 00:43:14,502
that I'd had with Jung Sub were finally falling into place.

888
00:43:14,873 --> 00:43:18,143
So I made up my mind while talking to Cho A.

889
00:43:18,303 --> 00:43:20,743
I'll change my attitude from now on.

890
00:43:21,013 --> 00:43:24,542
It doesn't matter how Jung Sub felt at the beginning.

891
00:43:24,913 --> 00:43:27,211
I like him now,

892
00:43:27,212 --> 00:43:29,953
so I'll focus on my feelings and express them.

893
00:43:30,252 --> 00:43:31,921
There were moments when I wanted to cut him off,

894
00:43:31,922 --> 00:43:34,421
but whenever I saw him, I fell apart.

895
00:43:34,422 --> 00:43:35,453
I see.

896
00:43:35,823 --> 00:43:37,252
I think I really like him.

897
00:43:38,022 --> 00:43:40,892
Really? Are you that into him?

898
00:43:40,893 --> 00:43:42,263
Yes. It's fascinating.

899
00:43:45,533 --> 00:43:46,861
Have a seat for a moment.

900
00:43:46,862 --> 00:43:47,873
Okay.

901
00:43:48,973 --> 00:43:50,843
- I hate today. - Why?

902
00:43:51,902 --> 00:43:53,073
Didn't you receive the text?

903
00:43:53,743 --> 00:43:55,442
Well, I did. Yun Ha...

904
00:43:56,473 --> 00:43:57,743
Ju Yeon.

905
00:43:58,712 --> 00:43:59,843
What about Ju Yeon again?

906
00:44:00,143 --> 00:44:01,853
- What's with him? - He's pretending to be tough.

907
00:44:02,413 --> 00:44:05,123
- That's true. - Yong Woo said it was okay.

908
00:44:05,982 --> 00:44:08,493
If you want to talk about it, just tell her.

909
00:44:09,853 --> 00:44:11,022
Didn't you receive the text?

910
00:44:11,763 --> 00:44:13,493
Well, I did. Yun Ha...

911
00:44:14,533 --> 00:44:15,832
Ju Yeon.

912
00:44:16,332 --> 00:44:18,502
I feel bad because of her.

913
00:44:18,732 --> 00:44:20,203
- Are you confused? - What?

914
00:44:20,703 --> 00:44:21,873
It's not that.

915
00:44:22,332 --> 00:44:23,332
What is this?

916
00:44:24,073 --> 00:44:25,473
(Well...)

917
00:44:26,843 --> 00:44:31,382
He seemed to be worried about something I didn't expect.

918
00:44:31,783 --> 00:44:34,553
"I'm worried a lot about Ju Yeon."

919
00:44:35,082 --> 00:44:36,683
I'm nobody,

920
00:44:37,453 --> 00:44:39,252
but I was in a situation to choose someone to text.

921
00:44:39,723 --> 00:44:43,521
I think it's too early to worry about Ju Yeon.

922
00:44:43,522 --> 00:44:47,062
You should think about how you feel.

923
00:44:48,332 --> 00:44:49,732
I just like Yun Ha no matter what.

924
00:44:49,962 --> 00:44:52,203
She didn't text you today, did she?

925
00:44:53,263 --> 00:44:55,131
Well, to be honest,

926
00:44:55,132 --> 00:44:57,272
she doesn't have to choose me just because I chose her.

927
00:44:57,803 --> 00:44:59,342
Honestly, there's no such obligation.

928
00:44:59,343 --> 00:45:03,073
If that's not a problem for you, why does this bother you?

929
00:45:03,573 --> 00:45:06,783
He seemed to be avoiding those feelings.

930
00:45:06,942 --> 00:45:11,482
"I'm feeling blue, but it's not because of Yun Ha."

931
00:45:11,982 --> 00:45:14,552
He was even lying to himself.

932
00:45:14,553 --> 00:45:15,752
(Scoffing)

933
00:45:19,792 --> 00:45:21,131
- She knows exactly what's going on. - She knows him so well.

934
00:45:21,132 --> 00:45:22,263
That's so satisfying.

935
00:45:22,493 --> 00:45:23,933
She's indeed like an older sister.

936
00:45:24,232 --> 00:45:26,103
He's denying reality at this point.

937
00:45:26,502 --> 00:45:30,472
That's why I asked him how he was feeling...

938
00:45:30,473 --> 00:45:33,041
about not receiving a text from Yun Ha.

939
00:45:33,042 --> 00:45:35,812
And he said, "It's okay. I can't do anything about it."

940
00:45:36,343 --> 00:45:37,343
"Is that so?"

941
00:45:37,344 --> 00:45:38,642
(Laughing)

942
00:45:38,643 --> 00:45:41,283
Why is this bothering you now?

943
00:45:41,353 --> 00:45:44,112
I'm not telling you what's bothering me.

944
00:45:44,453 --> 00:45:45,982
Well, I did reject her.

945
00:45:46,283 --> 00:45:47,593
That was so tough.

946
00:45:50,823 --> 00:45:52,861
Does he really feel bad about Ju Yeon,

947
00:45:52,862 --> 00:45:56,062
or is he just sad about not getting a text from Yun Ha?

948
00:45:57,033 --> 00:45:58,533
It's the latter.

949
00:45:59,332 --> 00:46:02,472
It's 100 percent the latter for the Yun Jae I know.

950
00:46:02,473 --> 00:46:05,203
He must believe that he's upset about Ju Yeon.

951
00:46:05,473 --> 00:46:07,042
I don't think...

952
00:46:07,343 --> 00:46:11,382
he believes the sad feeling is coming from Yun Ha.

953
00:46:11,743 --> 00:46:14,682
This is why I keep saying...

954
00:46:14,683 --> 00:46:16,853
he's delicate.

955
00:46:16,953 --> 00:46:19,053
It must be Ju Yeon. "Chipmunk?"

956
00:46:20,353 --> 00:46:21,691
- What? - "Chipmunk."

957
00:46:21,692 --> 00:46:23,192
"I had fun today, Chipmunk."

958
00:46:26,993 --> 00:46:29,263
Ju Yeon chose all of these for me.

959
00:46:31,803 --> 00:46:32,803
And?

960
00:46:33,163 --> 00:46:35,172
He wasn't acting, though.

961
00:46:35,473 --> 00:46:37,532
He's the type who focuses on emotions...

962
00:46:37,533 --> 00:46:40,143
that he directly sees or hears within himself.

963
00:46:40,303 --> 00:46:41,711
The invisible feelings...

964
00:46:41,712 --> 00:46:44,842
He doesn't notice how much Ju Yeon is into Jae Hyung...

965
00:46:44,843 --> 00:46:47,513
or how she feels about him.

966
00:46:47,953 --> 00:46:52,522
I think he was more worried about it because she's Yong Woo's sister.

967
00:46:52,882 --> 00:46:55,251
He thinks Yong Woo is cool...

968
00:46:55,252 --> 00:46:57,892
and even admires him in some ways.

969
00:46:57,893 --> 00:47:00,823
That might be why he was more nervous about it.

970
00:47:01,163 --> 00:47:03,493
Yong Woo went on a date with Yun Ha.

971
00:47:03,862 --> 00:47:06,533
The date must have gone well.

972
00:47:07,232 --> 00:47:08,533
It seems like it.

973
00:47:10,473 --> 00:47:12,303
To be honest,

974
00:47:12,603 --> 00:47:15,712
I do feel sad that she didn't text me.

975
00:47:16,312 --> 00:47:19,913
I told you. It's okay if she rejects me.

976
00:47:20,082 --> 00:47:21,183
That can happen.

977
00:47:21,913 --> 00:47:23,312
Oh, my!

978
00:47:23,482 --> 00:47:24,822
What's with all the timing today?

979
00:47:24,823 --> 00:47:25,952
Today's episode is like a soap opera!

980
00:47:25,953 --> 00:47:27,122
I know. She's eavesdropping.

981
00:47:27,123 --> 00:47:30,553
I told you. It's okay if she rejects me.

982
00:47:31,062 --> 00:47:32,192
That can happen.

983
00:47:32,522 --> 00:47:35,292
It's okay that I choose her, and she doesn't choose me back.

984
00:47:35,993 --> 00:47:37,032
I can understand that,

985
00:47:37,033 --> 00:47:39,533
but I saw how cheerful Ju Yeon was today.

986
00:47:40,433 --> 00:47:45,143
I felt like I threw a wet blanket on her mood.

987
00:47:45,502 --> 00:47:48,472
Maybe other people can brush it off.

988
00:47:48,473 --> 00:47:49,743
I understand.

989
00:47:50,073 --> 00:47:53,081
But when I saw the word "chipmunk" in the text,

990
00:47:53,082 --> 00:47:54,853
I didn't want to do anything today.

991
00:47:55,553 --> 00:47:57,183
In case I hurt her feelings.

992
00:47:58,053 --> 00:48:00,353
Let me ask you one question.

993
00:48:00,582 --> 00:48:02,493
Are your feelings for Yun Ha...

994
00:48:03,053 --> 00:48:04,522
strong?

995
00:48:04,962 --> 00:48:05,962
Yes.

996
00:48:12,062 --> 00:48:13,062
(Gosh.)

997
00:48:13,063 --> 00:48:14,603
I just don't want to do anything.

998
00:48:17,402 --> 00:48:18,402
(Yong Woo came again.)

999
00:48:18,403 --> 00:48:19,842
- Yes. - Aren't you going to eat?

1000
00:48:19,843 --> 00:48:20,942
Don't you want to drink more?

1001
00:48:21,712 --> 00:48:22,872
- Us? - Let me rest here for a bit...

1002
00:48:22,873 --> 00:48:24,041
like it's a rest stop.

1003
00:48:24,042 --> 00:48:25,082
A rest stop?

1004
00:48:25,542 --> 00:48:26,683
Rest stop?

1005
00:48:27,882 --> 00:48:28,912
(Sighing)

1006
00:48:28,913 --> 00:48:30,513
Why are you sighing?

1007
00:48:32,652 --> 00:48:35,453
Why did you all come when I was drinking alone?

1008
00:48:35,993 --> 00:48:37,792
You guys are ruining my mood.

1009
00:48:38,962 --> 00:48:40,921
- You punks are helpless. - "Punks?"

1010
00:48:40,922 --> 00:48:44,131
You always drank with us, but today you wanted to be alone.

1011
00:48:44,132 --> 00:48:46,102
Maybe I'm a little sentimental today.

1012
00:48:46,103 --> 00:48:48,772
Did you have to come here to disrupt me?

1013
00:48:49,332 --> 00:48:50,731
You guys are not getting it.

1014
00:48:50,732 --> 00:48:53,843
Well, the door is a little open.

1015
00:48:54,172 --> 00:48:56,311
- You saw him being alone? - I briefly saw him being alone.

1016
00:48:56,312 --> 00:48:58,582
I was like, "What? Is he an actor?"

1017
00:48:59,913 --> 00:49:01,611
It looked like a scene from "Misaeng."

1018
00:49:01,612 --> 00:49:03,481
- He's just messing with us. - That sounds annoying.

1019
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:04,623
Don't talk to him.

1020
00:49:05,022 --> 00:49:07,723
I came in, and we started talking.

1021
00:49:08,623 --> 00:49:09,623
Right.

1022
00:49:09,624 --> 00:49:11,222
I had a rough day today.

1023
00:49:11,223 --> 00:49:12,422
Today was really hard.

1024
00:49:15,732 --> 00:49:17,062
- It's the same every day. - Where did I put my phone?

1025
00:49:19,132 --> 00:49:20,162
My text...

1026
00:49:20,163 --> 00:49:22,172
(Ji Won leaves the room.)

1027
00:49:32,082 --> 00:49:33,412
- Here. - Yong Woo is there.

1028
00:49:33,413 --> 00:49:34,582
Why don't you wash up here, then?

1029
00:49:34,953 --> 00:49:36,712
Where did I put my phone?

1030
00:49:36,882 --> 00:49:40,122
Your phone can't be...

1031
00:49:40,123 --> 00:49:41,593
- It can't be here. - It can't be.

1032
00:49:41,993 --> 00:49:43,291
What time are we leaving tomorrow?

1033
00:49:43,292 --> 00:49:44,893
At 4pm.

1034
00:49:45,263 --> 00:49:46,823
- What are you going to wear? - Me?

1035
00:49:47,493 --> 00:49:48,992
- Yes. - I was thinking of wearing this.

1036
00:49:48,993 --> 00:49:51,231
You're stealing my colour palette.

1037
00:49:51,232 --> 00:49:52,332
I always do.

1038
00:49:52,732 --> 00:49:54,472
My overalls are in this colour.

1039
00:49:54,473 --> 00:49:56,001
- Really? - Let's wear this.

1040
00:49:56,002 --> 00:49:57,002
- This. - Okay.

1041
00:49:57,603 --> 00:50:00,942
I'll wear that colour with something gray under it.

1042
00:50:03,942 --> 00:50:05,312
Where is Se Seung?

1043
00:50:05,442 --> 00:50:06,642
She must be outside.

1044
00:50:06,643 --> 00:50:08,852
But Jung Sub is here.

1045
00:50:08,853 --> 00:50:10,082
Where did she go?

1046
00:50:10,752 --> 00:50:11,752
I don't know.

1047
00:50:13,223 --> 00:50:14,752
What happened to your sister?

1048
00:50:15,692 --> 00:50:16,692
I don't know.

1049
00:50:16,693 --> 00:50:18,362
Where is your sister?

1050
00:50:18,922 --> 00:50:20,862
What are they talking about?

1051
00:50:21,123 --> 00:50:22,163
I'm curious.

1052
00:50:22,692 --> 00:50:23,893
I'll follow you in.

1053
00:50:24,292 --> 00:50:26,362
I've brought a guest.

1054
00:50:26,663 --> 00:50:27,763
Welcome.

1055
00:50:30,232 --> 00:50:31,473
Where did I put my cigarettes?

1056
00:50:31,873 --> 00:50:33,343
I should borrow one from Cheol Hyeon.

1057
00:50:38,743 --> 00:50:39,783
Cheol Hyeon!

1058
00:50:40,982 --> 00:50:41,982
Hey.

1059
00:50:53,922 --> 00:50:55,933
Yun Ha didn't text you today?

1060
00:50:56,393 --> 00:50:58,862
Well, I'm okay with that.

1061
00:51:00,002 --> 00:51:02,402
We're used to rejection around this age.

1062
00:51:04,743 --> 00:51:05,873
Let's have a drink.

1063
00:51:06,373 --> 00:51:07,502
I want to drink a little today.

1064
00:51:08,542 --> 00:51:10,243
- My goodness. - Is this yours?

1065
00:51:10,542 --> 00:51:12,082
- Do you think it can be? - What?

1066
00:51:12,542 --> 00:51:14,683
- It's my brother's. - Why are you cranky?

1067
00:51:15,582 --> 00:51:16,712
Could it be mine?

1068
00:51:19,482 --> 00:51:20,522
Oh, my!

1069
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:23,053
Yong Woo, why...

1070
00:51:24,022 --> 00:51:25,062
Never mind.

1071
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:26,823
What?

1072
00:51:26,824 --> 00:51:29,291
Are you not sure about your feelings anymore,

1073
00:51:29,292 --> 00:51:30,962
or did you change your mind?

1074
00:51:31,362 --> 00:51:32,433
My stance...

1075
00:51:33,132 --> 00:51:34,361
is neutral now.

1076
00:51:34,362 --> 00:51:35,533
- Neutral? - Like the first day.

1077
00:51:36,303 --> 00:51:37,332
I see.

1078
00:51:38,473 --> 00:51:40,073
(Thinking)

1079
00:51:42,272 --> 00:51:45,312
Isn't that very natural, though?

1080
00:51:45,612 --> 00:51:47,582
It hasn't been that long since we met.

1081
00:51:48,082 --> 00:51:49,882
Of course, there are moments like that.

1082
00:51:51,422 --> 00:51:53,123
What made me start thinking was this.

1083
00:51:53,283 --> 00:51:57,022
I have never texted...

1084
00:51:57,123 --> 00:51:58,123
Yes.

1085
00:51:58,124 --> 00:51:59,722
someone else.

1086
00:51:59,723 --> 00:52:00,792
- I see. - Right.

1087
00:52:01,062 --> 00:52:02,893
- Did you know? - Yes.

1088
00:52:03,132 --> 00:52:05,232
Even though the question...

1089
00:52:05,703 --> 00:52:08,373
was about who made my heart flutter on that day,

1090
00:52:09,132 --> 00:52:12,343
I text the same person while being on a date with someone.

1091
00:52:13,172 --> 00:52:14,343
Even though that person was right in front of me.

1092
00:52:15,373 --> 00:52:16,973
I had those thoughts before,

1093
00:52:17,573 --> 00:52:19,612
but I didn't pay attention.

1094
00:52:20,343 --> 00:52:24,453
(On the first day he met Ji Won)

1095
00:52:25,053 --> 00:52:28,123
(Yong Woo was right in front of Ji Won.)

1096
00:52:28,553 --> 00:52:29,623
(To Ji Won)

1097
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:32,723
(He kept thinking for a while...)

1098
00:52:32,993 --> 00:52:35,862
(and texted Cho A.)

1099
00:52:36,263 --> 00:52:38,433
(The next day, the first snow fell.)

1100
00:52:39,763 --> 00:52:45,473
(Ji Won and Yong Woo were on a date all day.)

1101
00:52:45,843 --> 00:52:48,912
Well, when you put that on your wrist...

1102
00:52:48,913 --> 00:52:50,743
- and started doing this, - Yes.

1103
00:52:51,143 --> 00:52:53,712
I thought you might be good at shooting.

1104
00:52:54,112 --> 00:52:55,283
Well, I...

1105
00:52:56,482 --> 00:52:57,782
Do you know what I was thinking?

1106
00:52:57,783 --> 00:52:59,382
Don't you think it's a tie?

1107
00:53:00,882 --> 00:53:03,593
(But even that night...)

1108
00:53:04,862 --> 00:53:07,022
(Yong Woo texted Cho A.)

1109
00:53:10,132 --> 00:53:13,763
(Ji Won didn't receive any texts from Yong Woo.)

1110
00:53:18,373 --> 00:53:20,172
I had this thought at some point, though.

1111
00:53:20,803 --> 00:53:22,073
When I was on a date,

1112
00:53:22,812 --> 00:53:24,712
someone was the opposite of me,

1113
00:53:25,283 --> 00:53:27,211
and someone was just like me.

1114
00:53:27,212 --> 00:53:28,212
Yes.

1115
00:53:29,353 --> 00:53:31,251
That person felt really similar to me.

1116
00:53:31,252 --> 00:53:34,792
We're really similar but also different at the same time.

1117
00:53:35,093 --> 00:53:36,151
I feel that way too.

1118
00:53:36,152 --> 00:53:37,152
- Right? - Yes.

1119
00:53:37,153 --> 00:53:39,022
I feel again that we're similar but also different.

1120
00:53:39,422 --> 00:53:40,893
- We're different and similar. - Yes.

1121
00:53:41,832 --> 00:53:43,462
When talking to Ji Won...

1122
00:53:43,692 --> 00:53:44,901
I always thought...

1123
00:53:44,902 --> 00:53:48,033
Ju Yeon was the only woman version of me.

1124
00:53:48,473 --> 00:53:49,872
But she's like me only when it comes to looks.

1125
00:53:49,873 --> 00:53:53,002
Seeing Ji Won's way of thinking and talking,

1126
00:53:53,243 --> 00:53:56,112
I felt like she and I had some things in common.

1127
00:53:56,573 --> 00:54:00,643
I think I've mentioned this before.

1128
00:54:01,143 --> 00:54:02,312
Ji Won...

1129
00:54:03,212 --> 00:54:06,922
Her way of thinking is similar to mine.

1130
00:54:07,683 --> 00:54:10,692
I feel like I see...

1131
00:54:11,252 --> 00:54:13,093
a female version of myself in her.

1132
00:54:13,763 --> 00:54:14,992
She called herself the first son in the family.

1133
00:54:14,993 --> 00:54:17,262
She does seem like the first son.

1134
00:54:17,263 --> 00:54:19,533
Ji Won stays strong,

1135
00:54:20,332 --> 00:54:21,803
which I can relate to.

1136
00:54:22,473 --> 00:54:23,532
(The last interview back in Seoul)

1137
00:54:23,533 --> 00:54:26,442
Ji Won is like me.

1138
00:54:27,402 --> 00:54:30,513
Her attitude toward challenges and adversity...

1139
00:54:30,913 --> 00:54:32,481
reminds me of myself.

1140
00:54:32,482 --> 00:54:35,612
I get the feeling that she's strong internally.

1141
00:54:36,183 --> 00:54:37,953
And she doesn't seem to let it show.

1142
00:54:38,482 --> 00:54:42,553
Her inner strength feels like looking at myself.

1143
00:54:43,792 --> 00:54:45,263
She was so similar to me that...

1144
00:54:45,692 --> 00:54:48,492
For the past 17 or 18 days, it was the only time...

1145
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:49,993
I considered texting someone else.

1146
00:54:50,332 --> 00:54:52,663
- Because she was so like you? - She was so similar to me.

1147
00:54:53,632 --> 00:54:54,732
That's how I felt.

1148
00:54:57,132 --> 00:54:59,072
It looks like Yong Woo likes Ji Won.

1149
00:54:59,073 --> 00:55:00,501
He's talking about Ji Won.

1150
00:55:00,502 --> 00:55:01,512
Did she notice?

1151
00:55:01,513 --> 00:55:02,942
- Did she get it? - I think so.

1152
00:55:03,272 --> 00:55:04,941
"I texted the same person..."

1153
00:55:04,942 --> 00:55:07,442
"even when I was on a date with someone else."

1154
00:55:07,582 --> 00:55:10,812
He's giving her clues so she could know it's about her.

1155
00:55:11,112 --> 00:55:14,652
What's important is that Jae Hyung is there...

1156
00:55:15,422 --> 00:55:17,823
without knowing anything about it.

1157
00:55:18,593 --> 00:55:21,123
Right. He has no idea. He can't even imagine.

1158
00:55:21,692 --> 00:55:23,632
Lots of thoughts popped into my head.

1159
00:55:24,462 --> 00:55:25,762
Someone really similar to Yong Woo...

1160
00:55:25,763 --> 00:55:27,861
Then there's only Ju Yeon, who looks just like him.

1161
00:55:27,862 --> 00:55:30,001
- I'm not talking about the face. - I know.

1162
00:55:30,002 --> 00:55:31,972
- I know what you mean, though. - She really looks like you.

1163
00:55:31,973 --> 00:55:33,441
- You do? - You and Ju Yeon...

1164
00:55:33,442 --> 00:55:35,372
look alike, but you're different.

1165
00:55:35,373 --> 00:55:36,412
- They're different. - We're different inside.

1166
00:55:36,413 --> 00:55:37,811
- They're different inside. - But you're similar...

1167
00:55:37,812 --> 00:55:39,143
- We're completely different. - in that sense.

1168
00:55:39,243 --> 00:55:40,343
I was like,

1169
00:55:40,783 --> 00:55:43,612
"How can our way of thinking be so similar?"

1170
00:55:44,382 --> 00:55:47,183
I thought we would clash more because of that.

1171
00:55:48,393 --> 00:55:50,191
I might've had that thought by instinct.

1172
00:55:50,192 --> 00:55:51,292
(I see.)

1173
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:54,421
- Right. If you're too similar... - That's true. You should be...

1174
00:55:54,422 --> 00:55:56,191
- Right. - a little different...

1175
00:55:56,192 --> 00:55:57,361
- Right. - like magnets draw each other.

1176
00:55:57,362 --> 00:55:58,802
- But if you're too similar... - If you're too different,

1177
00:55:58,803 --> 00:55:59,861
you feel empty too.

1178
00:55:59,862 --> 00:56:01,501
- So... - Right.

1179
00:56:01,502 --> 00:56:03,703
- you should be like this. - Yes.

1180
00:56:04,172 --> 00:56:06,702
I'm getting a lot of counselling today.

1181
00:56:06,703 --> 00:56:08,873
- Counselling? - I'm a problematic child today.

1182
00:56:10,112 --> 00:56:11,941
What's interesting is...

1183
00:56:11,942 --> 00:56:15,053
that I had a lot of deep conversations today too.

1184
00:56:15,382 --> 00:56:17,413
I can see why you did, though.

1185
00:56:17,683 --> 00:56:18,722
Why?

1186
00:56:18,723 --> 00:56:20,683
You hadn't been on a date with her,

1187
00:56:21,152 --> 00:56:22,492
which means you had an opportunity to choose your date,

1188
00:56:22,493 --> 00:56:24,453
- but you hadn't picked her. - Right.

1189
00:56:24,792 --> 00:56:26,763
In a way, she could be someone you feel the most comfortable with.

1190
00:56:26,993 --> 00:56:28,022
Right!

1191
00:56:28,533 --> 00:56:30,162
- That's true. - Hence, deep conversations?

1192
00:56:30,163 --> 00:56:31,331
- Right. - You can have a deep talk...

1193
00:56:31,332 --> 00:56:32,501
at the last moment.

1194
00:56:32,502 --> 00:56:36,272
I felt so comfortable talking to her today.

1195
00:56:36,332 --> 00:56:37,802
I felt like I was talking to my own sister.

1196
00:56:37,803 --> 00:56:39,542
Right? I felt the same way.

1197
00:56:39,873 --> 00:56:43,271
Now that I think about it, I did feel so relaxed with Jung Sub.

1198
00:56:43,272 --> 00:56:44,272
- Yes. - I see.

1199
00:56:47,743 --> 00:56:50,283
Cho A, what are you going to do?

1200
00:56:51,312 --> 00:56:53,881
Hearing that from him, I felt like...

1201
00:56:53,882 --> 00:56:56,223
- I was stabbed in the back. - What is "that?"

1202
00:56:56,723 --> 00:56:58,593
He suddenly said he wanted to talk.

1203
00:56:59,192 --> 00:57:00,762
He was waiting for me here.

1204
00:57:00,763 --> 00:57:01,993
- Yong Woo? - Yes.

1205
00:57:02,192 --> 00:57:03,493
So I sat down.

1206
00:57:03,893 --> 00:57:06,061
He said...

1207
00:57:06,062 --> 00:57:09,973
his heart was fluttering for someone else.

1208
00:57:10,402 --> 00:57:11,872
That's what he told me.

1209
00:57:11,873 --> 00:57:15,412
Even at this moment, I'm not sure if I heard it right.

1210
00:57:15,413 --> 00:57:19,382
Anyway, since he said that right to my face...

1211
00:57:22,683 --> 00:57:23,683
I just felt like...

1212
00:57:23,953 --> 00:57:28,651
Hearing that he got into someone else directly from him,

1213
00:57:28,652 --> 00:57:30,353
that made me feel...

1214
00:57:31,152 --> 00:57:32,692
- weird. - That's so cruel.

1215
00:57:33,763 --> 00:57:36,632
Yes. It felt so cruel.

1216
00:57:36,962 --> 00:57:38,861
But I think he's like that.

1217
00:57:38,862 --> 00:57:40,561
- He thinks that's the courtesy. - He thought he was being polite.

1218
00:57:40,562 --> 00:57:42,303
Who made his heart flutter, though?

1219
00:57:42,402 --> 00:57:44,402
Yun Ha? His date today?

1220
00:57:44,603 --> 00:57:45,743
Or Ji Won?

1221
00:57:46,103 --> 00:57:49,413
- I do think it's Ji Won a little. - Do you think so?

1222
00:57:50,143 --> 00:57:52,282
I think I've seen him...

1223
00:57:52,283 --> 00:57:55,252
trying to talk to her a lot.

1224
00:57:58,752 --> 00:58:00,922
If we dipped it in truffle sauce, it'd be so good.

1225
00:58:01,123 --> 00:58:02,393
- Dipped what? - What?

1226
00:58:02,752 --> 00:58:03,791
Our hands?

1227
00:58:03,792 --> 00:58:04,993
- Whiskey? - What?

1228
00:58:05,223 --> 00:58:06,493
Can I try your cap?

1229
00:58:06,962 --> 00:58:08,061
- It's Ji Won's. - I'm curious.

1230
00:58:08,062 --> 00:58:10,232
- I see. - I wanted to try it.

1231
00:58:11,763 --> 00:58:13,433
- My head feels numb. - It's a nice cap.

1232
00:58:13,703 --> 00:58:14,763
It's nice.

1233
00:58:17,672 --> 00:58:19,573
Toast. My arm is falling asleep.

1234
00:58:20,073 --> 00:58:21,172
It's falling asleep?

1235
00:58:24,573 --> 00:58:26,183
You two are making similar faces.

1236
00:58:26,542 --> 00:58:28,082
Then you must look like us too.

1237
00:58:28,783 --> 00:58:32,422
This is my first time connecting with Ji Won.

1238
00:58:32,953 --> 00:58:34,453
We're connecting through our facial features.

1239
00:58:35,853 --> 00:58:40,763
I think the person Yong Woo is into is Ji Won.

1240
00:58:41,763 --> 00:58:43,092
When we were together,

1241
00:58:43,093 --> 00:58:45,803
he would often ask her questions.

1242
00:58:46,033 --> 00:58:47,501
Even at the end of the day,

1243
00:58:47,502 --> 00:58:50,131
he always seemed to...

1244
00:58:50,132 --> 00:58:52,902
want to join the group when Ji Won was there.

1245
00:58:54,743 --> 00:58:56,573
Trumpet for Yong Woo.

1246
00:58:56,812 --> 00:58:58,172
- Trumpet? - Trumpet?

1247
00:58:59,442 --> 00:59:01,013
- Guitar. - Guitar.

1248
00:59:01,582 --> 00:59:02,612
Good work.

1249
00:59:06,022 --> 00:59:07,652
There were so many things I couldn't do today.

1250
00:59:07,823 --> 00:59:10,122
I knew Ji Won was a good singer.

1251
00:59:10,123 --> 00:59:12,323
- Don't flatter me so much. - Though today was the first time.

1252
00:59:12,623 --> 00:59:14,561
- I could tell just from your voice. - She kept saying I was good,

1253
00:59:14,562 --> 00:59:15,762
but I've never sung here before.

1254
00:59:15,763 --> 00:59:17,061
I...

1255
00:59:17,062 --> 00:59:19,332
- "She must be a good singer." - It was like...

1256
00:59:19,533 --> 00:59:21,062
You're a good singer.

1257
00:59:21,332 --> 00:59:23,032
- I know. And then... - Of course.

1258
00:59:23,033 --> 00:59:26,803
He also complimented Ji Won often.

1259
00:59:27,303 --> 00:59:29,671
Everyone already heard she was a good driver and a good singer.

1260
00:59:29,672 --> 00:59:31,912
Ji Won seems shrewd.

1261
00:59:31,913 --> 00:59:32,913
Right.

1262
00:59:33,513 --> 00:59:34,913
She's super charming.

1263
00:59:35,312 --> 00:59:36,912
She's a charmer and a good person.

1264
00:59:36,913 --> 00:59:38,481
- Right. - I can't deny that.

1265
00:59:38,482 --> 00:59:39,482
True.

1266
00:59:39,823 --> 00:59:41,122
If I said she didn't,

1267
00:59:41,123 --> 00:59:43,353
I'd be just saying that to make you happy.

1268
00:59:44,993 --> 00:59:46,163
I don't want to do that.

1269
00:59:47,663 --> 00:59:48,663
I see.

1270
00:59:48,993 --> 00:59:51,263
I saw him like that often.

1271
00:59:52,062 --> 00:59:54,362
He was always paying attention to her.

1272
00:59:54,533 --> 00:59:55,772
I didn't know that.

1273
00:59:56,002 --> 00:59:58,802
Yong Woo said he didn't drink.

1274
00:59:58,803 --> 01:00:00,073
- Right. - That he didn't like drinking.

1275
01:00:01,243 --> 01:00:02,473
What? Why are you still up?

1276
01:00:02,913 --> 01:00:04,342
- Good night. See you tomorrow. - Good night.

1277
01:00:04,343 --> 01:00:06,643
- Good night. - I'll go to sleep too.

1278
01:00:06,913 --> 01:00:08,882
- I'm going to go. - Bye.

1279
01:00:09,612 --> 01:00:11,212
I'm tired. I'll go to sleep.

1280
01:00:12,553 --> 01:00:13,623
Would you move?

1281
01:00:14,882 --> 01:00:17,853

01:01:58,053 --> 01:01:59,062
Excuse me.

1298
01:01:59,692 --> 01:02:01,493
I came to borrow a spray.

1299
01:02:02,062 --> 01:02:03,062
What?

1300
01:02:05,862 --> 01:02:06,862
(Tapping)

1301
01:02:07,362 --> 01:02:09,033
- Excuse me. - Yes.

1302
01:02:14,973 --> 01:02:16,373
It's a different side of you.

1303
01:02:22,712 --> 01:02:23,752
Gosh.

1304
01:02:24,953 --> 01:02:26,953
You look prettier with your natural dark eyes.

1305
01:02:27,053 --> 01:02:28,223
- I do? - Yes.

1306
01:02:30,223 --> 01:02:32,561
What are we going to do today?

1307
01:02:32,562 --> 01:02:33,663
You can do what you want.

1308
01:02:36,862 --> 01:02:37,893
Okay.

1309
01:02:41,803 --> 01:02:43,902
Ji Won looks prettier without coloured contacts.

1310
01:02:44,303 --> 01:02:45,901
She looks prettier with no makeup.

1311
01:02:45,902 --> 01:02:47,902
I know. I was surprised when I saw her bare face.

1312
01:02:50,743 --> 01:02:52,743
(He came again to see her bare face.)

1313
01:02:52,812 --> 01:02:53,982
He came again.

1314
01:02:54,143 --> 01:02:56,352
Oh, my. Does he like her that much?

1315
01:02:56,353 --> 01:02:58,552
Isn't it bothersome?

1316
01:02:58,553 --> 01:03:00,421
Even if you like him?

1317
01:03:00,422 --> 01:03:01,751
- That's not so bad. - I'm totally fine with it.

1318
01:03:01,752 --> 01:03:04,493
"I want to sleep more." She might think like that.

1319
01:03:04,823 --> 01:03:06,292
They didn't go to Singapore to sleep.

1320
01:03:08,362 --> 01:03:09,392
You should sleep, though.

1321
01:03:09,393 --> 01:03:11,632
- "They didn't go there to sleep." - They went there to date.

1322

(Knocking)

1324
01:03:22,513 --> 01:03:23,542
Wake up.

1325
01:03:24,942 --> 01:03:25,942
Are you going to sleep?

1326
01:03:26,612 --> 01:03:28,413
I should wake up.

1327
01:03:37,922 --> 01:03:39,422
You look like a penguin.

1328
01:03:42,033 --> 01:03:43,062
What?

1329
01:03:43,593 --> 01:03:45,232
You really look like a penguin.

1330
01:03:46,433 --> 01:03:48,772
I've heard of it.

1331
01:03:54,373 --> 01:03:56,212
(Laughing)

1332
01:03:57,612 --> 01:03:59,212
She was sleeping.

1333
01:03:59,413 --> 01:04:02,182
And she resembled a penguin from the side.

1334
01:04:02,183 --> 01:04:05,422
I put my hand on her face and said she looked like one.

1335
01:04:05,823 --> 01:04:06,853
Tell me.

1336
01:04:08,382 --> 01:04:11,053
When are you going to wake up?

1337
01:04:11,623 --> 01:04:13,163
Ten minutes later.

1338
01:04:13,663 --> 01:04:14,862
- Really? - Yes.

1339
01:04:15,263 --> 01:04:16,332
Okay.

1340
01:04:16,663 --> 01:04:19,663
- What time did you go to bed? - I took a shower at 6am.

1341
01:04:21,763 --> 01:04:22,803
Why on earth?

1342
01:04:25,002 --> 01:04:26,672
I was just thinking.

1343
01:04:26,973 --> 01:04:28,441
- You were thinking? - Yes.

1344
01:04:28,442 --> 01:04:29,513
What did you think?

1345
01:04:29,913 --> 01:04:32,442
I was thinking, and it already became 5am.

1346
01:04:34,612 --> 01:04:37,152
I fell asleep, so I woke up and took a shower.

1347
01:04:37,582 --> 01:04:38,882
See you.

1348
01:04:39,382 --> 01:04:41,882
- See you. - See you later.

1349
01:04:43,353 --> 01:04:44,993
We won't have to bring an umbrella, right?

1350
01:04:45,093 --> 01:04:47,061
- I don't think we should. - Let's get rained on when it rains.

1351
01:04:47,062 --> 01:04:48,162
It sounds great.

1355
01:05:00,143 --> 01:05:02,041

Good. Okay. Let's go.

1363
01:05:15,152 --> 01:05:16,752
- Let's go. - Let's go.

- Okay. - Are you serious?

1376
01:05:39,513 --> 01:05:41,211
- Hands off? - Hands off.

- Put your arm up. - Arm up.

- Oh, my. - Gosh.

1390
01:06:15,853 --> 01:06:17,982
This is scarier than bungee jumping.

1391
01:06:18,382 --> 01:06:19,382
Why?

01:06:20,422 --> 01:06:21,752
- Gosh. - My gosh.

1393
01:06:21,982 --> 01:06:24,452
- Look to the front. - How can we do this?

1394
01:06:24,453 --> 01:06:26,162
This is like...

1395
01:06:26,163 --> 01:06:29,332
You can feel that you're going up.

1396
01:06:29,792 --> 01:06:31,332
My goodness.

(They reached a height of 43m, which is equivalent to 17 stories.)

1398
01:06:46,183 --> 01:06:48,081
I don't think I can do this.

1399
01:06:48,082 --> 01:06:50,611
- Yes, you can. - No, I can't do it.

1400
01:06:50,612 --> 01:06:52,751
- I can't do it. - It's shaking.

1401
01:06:52,752 --> 01:06:54,521
I don't think I can do this.

1402
01:06:54,522 --> 01:06:56,252
- You think you can't do this? - Hold on.

1403
01:06:59,462 --> 01:07:01,593
- I can do it. - You don't have to do it.

1404
01:07:02,632 --> 01:07:03,893
You...

1405
01:07:04,232 --> 01:07:05,392
- Should I do it? - No.

1406
01:07:05,393 --> 01:07:07,002
- Don't do it! - Okay.

1407
01:07:08,433 --> 01:07:11,032
Let's link our arms like this.

1408
01:07:11,033 --> 01:07:12,243
All right.

1409
01:07:13,973 --> 01:07:15,742
- Do it like this. Yes. - Like this?

1410
01:07:15,743 --> 01:07:16,772
Okay.

1411
01:07:17,712 --> 01:07:19,082
Oh, no. They should pull it.

1412
01:07:19,212 --> 01:07:20,743
But she did bungee jumping before.

1413
01:07:20,843 --> 01:07:22,512
- It must feel different. - It must feel different.

1414
01:07:22,513 --> 01:07:23,652
They were floating in the air.

1415
01:07:23,712 --> 01:07:24,881
You can stand on the platform when you do bungee jumping.

1416
01:07:24,882 --> 01:07:26,553
- You're right. - Oh, no.

1417
01:07:27,453 --> 01:07:28,521
It's okay.

1418
01:07:28,522 --> 01:07:29,791
(They are still up in the air at 43m above the ground.)

1419
01:07:29,792 --> 01:07:31,422
- You should count to three. - Okay.

1420
01:07:33,893 --> 01:07:34,893
Here I go.

1421
01:07:35,062 --> 01:07:37,393
- Chin down. - Chin down.

1422
01:07:38,263 --> 01:07:39,602
- One, two... - Two, three.

1423
01:07:39,603 --> 01:07:42,232
- Wait. I'm sorry. - It's all right.

1424
01:07:43,933 --> 01:07:44,933
Okay.

1425
01:07:45,902 --> 01:07:46,902
- Here I go. - Yes.

1426
01:07:46,903 --> 01:07:48,541
- I'm really doing it, Jung Sub. - Okay.

1427
01:07:48,542 --> 01:07:50,073
- In 1, 2, 3. - Close your eyes.

1428
01:08:00,723 --> 01:08:01,853
Yes!

1429
01:08:07,723 --> 01:08:09,532
Oh, my gosh!

1430
01:08:18,433 --> 01:08:19,443
Yes!

1431
01:08:20,242 --> 01:08:22,943
- It was really scary at first. - We did it!

1432
01:08:24,313 --> 01:08:25,542
I think I'm going to drool.

1433
01:08:31,282 --> 01:08:32,382
This is fun.

1434
01:08:33,322 --> 01:08:35,653
- Wasn't it crazy at first? - It was crazy at first.

1435
01:08:36,353 --> 01:08:38,393
It was so scary at first. Goodness.

1436
01:08:38,723 --> 01:08:41,092
Good. You were very brave.

1437
01:08:41,093 --> 01:08:43,232
- Gosh, it was so scary. - You were so brave.

1438
01:08:43,233 --> 01:08:44,992
When you unbuckled it...

1439
01:08:45,803 --> 01:08:49,132
Se Seung was shivering so much.

1440
01:08:49,233 --> 01:08:52,402
I was scared too, but she was extremely nervous.

1441
01:08:52,403 --> 01:08:54,071
So I was more concerned about that.

1442
01:08:54,072 --> 01:08:55,342
As I calmed her down,

1443
01:08:55,343 --> 01:08:57,212
she took a deep breath and released it.

1444
01:08:57,372 --> 01:09:00,282
It was the best date of my life.

1445
01:09:00,643 --> 01:09:03,251
I was so happy that I did it with him.

1446
01:09:03,252 --> 01:09:05,652
We overcame the fear...

1447
01:09:05,653 --> 01:09:07,182
together.

1448
01:09:07,183 --> 01:09:09,892
I had to pull the lever,

1449
01:09:09,893 --> 01:09:12,523
so he thanked me and said I was amazing.

1450
01:09:12,662 --> 01:09:16,062
I could pull it because Jung Sub was next to me.

1451
01:09:16,063 --> 01:09:17,462
So I was more thankful.

1452
01:09:17,962 --> 01:09:19,262
My knees are shaking.

1453
01:09:19,263 --> 01:09:22,232
- They're blinded by love. - What are they doing?

1454
01:09:22,233 --> 01:09:23,772
They'll be happy whatever they do for the time being.

1455
01:09:23,773 --> 01:09:25,473
The benefit for the last place is so good.

1456
01:09:27,973 --> 01:09:30,542
(The house in Singapore)

1457
01:09:30,572 --> 01:09:32,912
(Yun Jae is going to make kimchi fried rice.)

1458
01:09:33,683 --> 01:09:36,313
(He puts two eggs on the side.)

1459
01:09:36,882 --> 01:09:39,483
Eggs. Where are they?

1460
01:09:40,882 --> 01:09:43,023
Where did the two eggs go?

1461
01:09:43,292 --> 01:09:46,492
(They're right in front of his eyes, but he doesn't know.)

1462
01:09:48,093 --> 01:09:49,792
I'll find them later.

1463
01:09:50,733 --> 01:09:52,161
They're right there.

1464
01:09:52,162 --> 01:09:54,363
It's like you're looking for your phone while holding it.

1465
01:09:54,502 --> 01:09:56,473
- He's preoccupied. - Yes.

1466
01:09:56,603 --> 01:09:57,872
It can happen.

1467
01:09:58,572 --> 01:10:00,603
Why can't I see the eggs I put aside earlier?

1468
01:10:02,473 --> 01:10:04,042
Oh, this can't happen.

1469
01:10:04,742 --> 01:10:06,412
I'm all over the place.

1470
01:10:06,513 --> 01:10:08,282
I should get it together.

1471
01:10:10,353 --> 01:10:12,352
I saw it somewhere, and I can't find it.

1472
01:10:12,353 --> 01:10:13,983
It's driving me crazy.

1473
01:10:14,422 --> 01:10:16,422
The scissors were here. My gosh.

1474
01:10:17,053 --> 01:10:20,092
I was disheartened when I woke up in the morning.

1475
01:10:20,093 --> 01:10:22,563
I wasn't in my right mind.

1476
01:10:22,792 --> 01:10:24,631
I didn't receive a text,

1477
01:10:24,632 --> 01:10:26,563
so I had different kinds of feelings.

1478
01:10:27,063 --> 01:10:29,473
(He completes kimchi fried rice despite the mental struggles.)

1479
01:10:29,933 --> 01:10:31,933
- Ju Yeon. - Yes?

1480
01:10:32,443 --> 01:10:33,473
The food is ready.

1481
01:10:33,773 --> 01:10:34,872
- Thank you. - Come down.

1482
01:10:36,273 --> 01:10:39,143
You do it like that? You're good indeed.

1483
01:10:41,683 --> 01:10:43,153
- Thank you for the food. - You're welcome.

1484
01:10:43,952 --> 01:10:46,322
- Are you not eating? - I'm eating.

1485
01:10:47,223 --> 01:10:48,282
Let's eat together then.

1486
01:10:49,093 --> 01:10:50,252
Enjoy your meal.

1487
01:10:50,353 --> 01:10:52,422
- Thank you. - I'll eat with Ju Yeon.

1488
01:10:56,962 --> 01:10:58,232
- Is it okay? - Yes.

1489
01:10:58,233 --> 01:11:00,032
- Oh, my. - It's good.

1490
01:11:00,832 --> 01:11:03,233
Did he cook for you a lot when you were living together?

1491
01:11:03,803 --> 01:11:05,532
- Well... - I didn't.

1492
01:11:06,042 --> 01:11:07,542
He did cook for me sometimes.

1493
01:11:08,002 --> 01:11:09,943
- Hello. - Hello.

1494
01:11:10,172 --> 01:11:11,472
You should eat, Ju Yeon.

1495
01:11:11,473 --> 01:11:13,711
- Can you eat spicy food? - Yes.

1496
01:11:13,712 --> 01:11:15,712
- Can you? - Yes, I can.

1497
01:11:16,082 --> 01:11:19,053
You look like you would enjoy spicy food with soju.

1498
01:11:19,952 --> 01:11:21,322
That doesn't sound like a compliment.

1499
01:11:22,853 --> 01:11:24,693
I wish I could eat spicy food with soju too.

1500
01:11:25,223 --> 01:11:26,223
- Spicy food? - Yes.

1501
01:11:26,224 --> 01:11:28,522
Can you eat things like chicken feet?

1502
01:11:28,523 --> 01:11:31,063
It's not my cup of tea.

1503
01:11:32,632 --> 01:11:34,233
But I could try.

1504
01:11:35,462 --> 01:11:36,803
Are you up?

1505
01:11:37,072 --> 01:11:39,372
- Is that kimchi fried rice? - Yes.

1506
01:11:39,603 --> 01:11:42,343
- He made it for us. - Really? We had kimchi?

1507
01:11:42,513 --> 01:11:43,513
Yong Woo bought it.

1508
01:11:43,672 --> 01:11:46,282
- Really? Today? - Come here.

1509
01:11:46,483 --> 01:11:47,513
Have a bite.

1510
01:11:49,113 --> 01:11:50,881
(Savouring)

1511
01:11:50,882 --> 01:11:53,183
- This is so good. - Is it good?

1512
01:11:53,582 --> 01:11:55,251
- It's really good. - I'm glad to hear that.

1513
01:11:55,252 --> 01:11:57,252
- This is amazing. - Is it good?

1514
01:11:57,393 --> 01:11:59,763
- The kimchi fried rice is amazing. - Yes.

1515
01:12:00,292 --> 01:12:01,593
I'm going to swim.

1516
01:12:05,363 --> 01:12:06,363
It's cold.

1517
01:12:07,702 --> 01:12:08,702
He's doing it by himself?

1518
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:10,201
When you're devastated...

1519
01:12:10,202 --> 01:12:12,572
- You do weird things. - "Weird things."

1520
01:12:12,643 --> 01:12:15,273
I guess he feels uncomfortable to stay inside.

1521
01:12:17,513 --> 01:12:18,513
It's cold.

1522
01:12:18,513 --> 01:12:19,513
(The weird thing)

1523
01:12:20,183 --> 01:12:21,212
Gosh.

1524
01:12:22,582 --> 01:12:24,652
- My gosh. - What's the matter with him?

1525
01:12:24,653 --> 01:12:27,353
Don't go in there with a cap.

1526
01:12:27,553 --> 01:12:29,921
Gosh, even I've worn it only a few times.

1527
01:12:29,922 --> 01:12:31,492
- He's unbelievable. - Take it away from him.

1528
01:12:31,992 --> 01:12:32,992
Oh, my.

1529
01:12:34,193 --> 01:12:36,331
It's cold. I don't think this would work.

1530
01:12:36,332 --> 01:12:37,933
(Groaning)

1531
01:12:38,532 --> 01:12:39,563
(Sighing)

1532
01:12:40,363 --> 01:12:41,402
I can do it.

1533
01:12:41,403 --> 01:12:42,403
(A battle against himself)

1534
01:12:43,202 --> 01:12:46,172
Yesterday, my brother complimented you a lot.

1535
01:12:46,742 --> 01:12:47,803
What did he say?

1536
01:12:48,572 --> 01:12:50,711
He said you were indeed mature as you were older than him.

1537
01:12:50,712 --> 01:12:52,712
He said he realized many things thanks to me.

1538
01:12:53,143 --> 01:12:54,683
I have no idea what it is.

1539
01:12:55,483 --> 01:12:58,212
He tends to beat around the bush.

1540
01:12:58,313 --> 01:12:59,421
- Right? - Yes.

1541
01:12:59,422 --> 01:13:01,152
I don't understand at first either.

1542
01:13:01,153 --> 01:13:03,153
- He talks to you like that too? - Yes.

1543
01:13:03,353 --> 01:13:04,991
- Why on earth does he do that? - So I said,

1544
01:13:04,992 --> 01:13:06,862
"You can speak directly to me."

1545
01:13:06,863 --> 01:13:08,693
I said this,

1546
01:13:09,233 --> 01:13:10,292
but he...

1547
01:13:10,662 --> 01:13:12,092
Everyone knows.

1548
01:13:12,093 --> 01:13:13,501
I guess it's not just us.

1549
01:13:13,502 --> 01:13:15,832
That's how he speaks.

1550
01:13:16,473 --> 01:13:18,472
- Doesn't it stand out too much? - It does a little bit.

1551
01:13:18,473 --> 01:13:19,773
- Black would be better. - Yes.

1552
01:13:20,403 --> 01:13:23,572
Do you have long skirts only?

1553
01:13:24,372 --> 01:13:25,911
It looks uncomfortable.

1554
01:13:25,912 --> 01:13:28,411
- I'm sorry, - It looks bulky.

1555
01:13:28,412 --> 01:13:31,313
but the fact that I'm wearing a skirt...

1556
01:13:31,452 --> 01:13:33,153
is already a big compromise for me.

1557
01:13:34,122 --> 01:13:35,622
Why do I look so hot?

1558
01:13:36,553 --> 01:13:39,153
Yes, you'll be overheated. Wear a short-sleeved shirt...

1559
01:13:39,422 --> 01:13:41,022
or a short skirt.

1560
01:13:41,023 --> 01:13:43,232
- Do you think it's fall? - Hey, look at yourself.

1561
01:13:43,233 --> 01:13:44,262
I'm at home.

1562
01:13:44,263 --> 01:13:46,263
- The air conditioner is on. - You're not the one to say that.

1563
01:13:47,233 --> 01:13:48,461
A short-sleeved shirt would look better.

1564
01:13:48,462 --> 01:13:49,973
It might look like that I didn't put effort then.

1565
01:13:50,502 --> 01:13:52,532
Your outfit doesn't seem very thoughtful even now.

1566
01:13:55,943 --> 01:13:57,212
I should cook.

1567
01:14:00,513 --> 01:14:01,613
What are you going to make?

1568
01:14:02,513 --> 01:14:04,782
I'm going to marinate the meat for bulgogi, but it smells too spicy.

1569
01:14:06,353 --> 01:14:08,023
Are you okay with doenjang stew?

1570
01:14:08,282 --> 01:14:10,053
It sounds great.

1571
01:14:10,252 --> 01:14:12,193
Do you need help with cooking?

1572
01:14:12,523 --> 01:14:14,693
No, for now,

1573
01:14:16,032 --> 01:14:17,462
I'm just thinking about what I should do.

1574
01:14:28,473 --> 01:14:30,412
- He feels a little uncomfortable. - I know.

1575
01:14:30,513 --> 01:14:31,513
It seems he doesn't know what to do.

1576
01:14:31,514 --> 01:14:32,711
Right. He doesn't know what to do.

1577
01:14:32,712 --> 01:14:33,882
His ears are red too.

1578
01:14:34,143 --> 01:14:35,313
He must be upset.

1579
01:14:35,843 --> 01:14:38,752
I was very upset when I saw her in the afternoon.

1580
01:14:39,322 --> 01:14:42,282
It's because I was rejected.

1581
01:14:42,422 --> 01:14:43,491
When I saw her,

1582
01:14:43,492 --> 01:14:46,063
I tried my best to avoid looking in her direction.

1583
01:14:48,462 --> 01:14:51,563
He didn't make eye contact in the kitchen.

1584
01:14:51,662 --> 01:14:53,562
He didn't even glance at me.

1585
01:14:53,563 --> 01:14:55,531
So I just grabbed him...

1586
01:14:55,532 --> 01:14:57,332
and said, "We should talk."

1587
01:14:59,372 --> 01:15:01,972
Come here for a moment.

1588
01:15:01,973 --> 01:15:03,042
What?

1589
01:15:06,613 --> 01:15:08,482
I don't usually do that.

1590
01:15:08,483 --> 01:15:10,281
But I had to do it.

1591
01:15:10,282 --> 01:15:12,751
"I care about Yun Jae..."

1592
01:15:12,752 --> 01:15:14,853
"more than I thought."

1593
01:15:15,422 --> 01:15:16,422
What is it?

1594
01:15:17,153 --> 01:15:18,153
What's the matter?

1595
01:15:18,252 --> 01:15:19,791
Let's just talk.

1596
01:15:19,792 --> 01:15:21,062
You surprised me.

1597
01:15:21,063 --> 01:15:22,393
- Sorry? - You could've just said so.

1598
01:15:23,162 --> 01:15:24,693
Why did you scare me like that?

1599
01:15:25,593 --> 01:15:27,063
What? I mean...

1600
01:15:27,363 --> 01:15:29,202
It seemed like you were in a bad mood yesterday.

1601
01:15:29,433 --> 01:15:31,832
You don't have to worry about it.

1602
01:15:32,502 --> 01:15:33,572
Why not?

1603
01:15:33,843 --> 01:15:35,872
I was worried about other things.

1604
01:15:37,143 --> 01:15:41,682
It seems you had a great time yesterday.

1605
01:15:41,683 --> 01:15:44,653
I saw the pictures too.

1606
01:15:44,853 --> 01:15:47,082
So I thought...

1607
01:15:47,422 --> 01:15:48,952
you might choose her.

1608
01:15:49,723 --> 01:15:53,023
I honestly respect your choice.

1609
01:15:53,662 --> 01:15:55,462
You can choose someone else,

1610
01:15:55,723 --> 01:15:56,792
and there's nothing I can do about it.

1611
01:15:57,063 --> 01:16:00,162
You should follow your heart, and I should follow mine.

1612
01:16:00,403 --> 01:16:02,062
I wasn't mad because of it.

1613
01:16:02,063 --> 01:16:03,433
It doesn't...

1614
01:16:04,702 --> 01:16:06,072
offend me or anything.

1615
01:16:06,803 --> 01:16:09,473
When you're my age, you get used to getting rejected.

1616
01:16:10,072 --> 01:16:11,943
But it might be different for Ju Yeon.

1617
01:16:13,082 --> 01:16:14,343
I see.

1618
01:16:15,343 --> 01:16:18,082
I feel sorry because I'm not used to this kind of situation either.

1619
01:16:18,553 --> 01:16:20,653
Why am I in such a bad mood today?

1620
01:16:20,853 --> 01:16:23,893
It bothered me a lot.

1621
01:16:24,093 --> 01:16:26,063
You don't have to check in on my feelings all the time.

1622
01:16:27,223 --> 01:16:28,422
It's all right.

1623
01:16:29,023 --> 01:16:31,791
I hope you like me,

1624
01:16:31,792 --> 01:16:35,063
but I should understand that you might not like me back.

1625
01:16:35,303 --> 01:16:38,071
So please don't worry and follow your heart.

1626
01:16:38,072 --> 01:16:39,172
I'm fine.

1627
01:16:39,803 --> 01:16:41,701
We spent so much time together...

1628
01:16:41,702 --> 01:16:43,812
and talked a lot.

1629
01:16:43,813 --> 01:16:45,672
What we have...

1630
01:16:46,683 --> 01:16:47,742
is much deeper.

1631
01:16:47,983 --> 01:16:50,513
I asked you just now because I thought it'd bother me all day.

1632
01:16:51,483 --> 01:16:52,553
It was nice.

1633
01:16:54,353 --> 01:16:57,822
I couldn't listen to her well.

1634
01:16:58,122 --> 01:17:01,862
I think I just said what I wanted to say.

1635
01:17:01,863 --> 01:17:05,062
I was anxious.

1636
01:17:05,063 --> 01:17:07,532
I thought my relationship with her might end.

1637
01:17:07,763 --> 01:17:10,332
If I say that, I might pressure her.

1638
01:17:10,502 --> 01:17:14,642
I thought I would hear an answer I didn't want to hear.

1639
01:17:14,643 --> 01:17:17,643
So I wanted to avoid the conversation and leave.

1640
01:17:18,042 --> 01:17:20,281
(That afternoon)

1641
01:17:20,282 --> 01:17:22,782
Should I organize my suitcase?

1642
01:17:32,723 --> 01:17:34,762
What? It's that plushie.

1643
01:17:34,763 --> 01:17:36,732
- What plushie? - What was the name?

1644
01:17:36,733 --> 01:17:37,792
The thing he shot at that time.

1645
01:17:38,632 --> 01:17:40,302
Saet Norae.

1646
01:17:40,303 --> 01:17:41,903
- Norae. - Saet Norae.

1647
01:17:51,973 --> 01:17:55,012
It was funny. When I was organizing my suitcase today,

1648
01:17:55,013 --> 01:17:57,352
I found the stuffed dolphin I got...

1649
01:17:57,353 --> 01:17:58,752
when I went shooting with Ji Won on Jebu Island.

1650
01:17:59,053 --> 01:18:01,022
(Ji Won and Yong Woo went on a date on Jebu Island...)

1651
01:18:01,023 --> 01:18:02,281
(on the day of the first snow.)

1652
01:18:02,282 --> 01:18:03,422
- Thank you. - This is cute.

1653
01:18:03,822 --> 01:18:05,692
(This is my Norae.)

1654
01:18:05,693 --> 01:18:06,991
(Norae?)

1655
01:18:06,992 --> 01:18:08,461
(Its name is Norae?)

1656
01:18:08,462 --> 01:18:09,862
(Its surname is Saet.)

1657
01:18:09,863 --> 01:18:11,132
(Saet Norae?)

1658
01:18:11,263 --> 01:18:13,732
I could've just left it in the house in Seoul...

1659
01:18:13,733 --> 01:18:15,661
or put it in another suitcase...

1660
01:18:15,662 --> 01:18:17,403
because we had to pack in a hurry.

1661
01:18:17,733 --> 01:18:19,572
But it followed me there.

1662
01:18:35,523 --> 01:18:37,892
The most memorable thing...

1663
01:18:37,893 --> 01:18:41,422
she told me was her opinion about fate.

1664
01:18:41,662 --> 01:18:44,562
I believe in fate.

1665
01:18:44,563 --> 01:18:45,632
I see.

1666
01:18:45,733 --> 01:18:48,631
There's a reason for everything.

1667
01:18:48,632 --> 01:18:50,332
No matter how much I think about it,

1668
01:18:50,702 --> 01:18:53,201
there aren't many things I can change.

1669
01:18:53,202 --> 01:18:54,302
So if I did my best,

1670
01:18:54,303 --> 01:18:56,712
- That's good enough? I see. - I let my fate decide.

1671
01:18:56,813 --> 01:19:00,081
At the end, it simplifies the complexities.

1672
01:19:00,082 --> 01:19:01,112
Right.

1673
01:19:01,113 --> 01:19:02,782
You're using fate as an excuse...

1674
01:19:02,882 --> 01:19:04,951
- to make me feel comfortable. - Right.

1675
01:19:04,952 --> 01:19:06,653
How nice is that?

1676
01:19:07,822 --> 01:19:09,282
I thought it was interesting.

1677
01:19:09,452 --> 01:19:10,553
"Why is this here?"

1678
01:19:20,263 --> 01:19:22,032
- Are you not wearing an outer? - No.

1679
01:19:22,233 --> 01:19:23,603
It'd be better without one.

1680
01:19:24,072 --> 01:19:25,632
Go and win his heart.

1681
01:19:26,202 --> 01:19:27,242
You can do it.

1682
01:19:27,843 --> 01:19:29,442
It's not time for you to worry about me.

1683
01:19:29,443 --> 01:19:30,643
(Scoffing)

1684
01:19:31,513 --> 01:19:34,282
How can you say that to me when I can't even go on a date?

1685
01:19:35,242 --> 01:19:36,513
You'd be much taller.

1686
01:19:37,353 --> 01:19:40,353
How is it? Is this height okay for you?

1687
01:19:42,782 --> 01:19:43,853
Thanks.

1688
01:19:45,193 --> 01:19:47,922
The weather is nice.

1689
01:19:49,992 --> 01:19:51,232
Hello.

1690
01:19:51,233 --> 01:19:52,791
- Hello. - Hello.

1691
01:19:52,792 --> 01:19:54,032
He's cute.

1692
01:19:55,002 --> 01:19:58,632
(Ji Won and Jae Hyung go on the Benefit Date for Last Place.)

1693
01:19:59,872 --> 01:20:01,843
You didn't do this with your hair today.

1694
01:20:03,072 --> 01:20:04,943
- The tail? I didn't do it. - Do you call it tail?

1695
01:20:05,343 --> 01:20:06,613
I tied my hair yesterday.

1696
01:20:07,613 --> 01:20:08,813
So I didn't tie it today.

1697
01:20:09,143 --> 01:20:10,451
I'm not wearing contacts either.

1698
01:20:10,452 --> 01:20:11,813
Right. You look pretty.

1699
01:20:12,412 --> 01:20:15,652
I wanted to see your natural eyes.

1700
01:20:15,653 --> 01:20:19,052
You look like a baby without makeup.

1701
01:20:19,053 --> 01:20:20,961
My bare face? In the morning?

1702
01:20:20,962 --> 01:20:22,622
Yes. You looked like a penguin.

1703
01:20:23,733 --> 01:20:24,763
A penguin?

1704
01:20:24,962 --> 01:20:27,831
It was crazy yesterday.

1705
01:20:27,832 --> 01:20:31,233
I did feel the tension,

1706
01:20:31,832 --> 01:20:35,202
but I didn't know what was going on exactly.

1707
01:20:35,303 --> 01:20:37,343
I could feel the storm,

1708
01:20:37,473 --> 01:20:39,313
but I didn't know what kind.

1709
01:20:39,513 --> 01:20:40,942
I was thinking about...

1710
01:20:40,943 --> 01:20:43,082
what I should write.

1711
01:20:43,282 --> 01:20:44,412
What did you think...

1712
01:20:45,113 --> 01:20:46,153
- about my message? - I saw it.

1713
01:20:46,483 --> 01:20:48,153
It was just...

1714
01:20:50,822 --> 01:20:52,452
Why are you so sassy?

1715
01:20:53,063 --> 01:20:56,492
I became sassy because you are.

1716
01:21:01,532 --> 01:21:02,933
- What? - Are they going to talk...

1717
01:21:07,002 --> 01:21:08,041
- Come on. - Come on.

1718
01:21:08,042 --> 01:21:09,342
- What was that? - What's this?

1719
01:21:09,343 --> 01:21:10,911
- He should've just held her hand. - I would've held her hand.

1720
01:21:10,912 --> 01:21:11,973
Really?

1721
01:21:12,473 --> 01:21:15,082
They did a high five.

1722
01:21:17,882 --> 01:21:20,853
Do you treat your girlfriend as if she's your friend?

1723
01:21:21,082 --> 01:21:22,822
I treat her like a baby.

1724
01:21:23,952 --> 01:21:25,452
- Like a baby? - Yes.

1725
01:21:25,553 --> 01:21:28,821
I adore her a lot.

1726
01:21:28,822 --> 01:21:31,093
And I cherish her.

1727
01:21:31,792 --> 01:21:33,863
I think I'm mostly like that.

1728
01:21:34,162 --> 01:21:36,871
I think I'm one of these two.

1729
01:21:36,872 --> 01:21:38,273
Sometimes,

1730
01:21:38,372 --> 01:21:42,242
I adore and tease my boyfriend.

1731
01:21:42,502 --> 01:21:46,643
I joke around. That's one of them.

1732
01:21:46,843 --> 01:21:50,911
Sometimes, I deeply connect emotionally...

1733
01:21:50,912 --> 01:21:52,353
with him too.

1734
01:21:52,653 --> 01:21:54,222
For now,

1735
01:21:54,223 --> 01:21:57,751
I want to meet someone...

1736
01:21:57,752 --> 01:22:00,422
who I can deeply connect with.

1737
01:22:00,763 --> 01:22:02,422
I think that might be why.

1738
01:22:03,792 --> 01:22:06,233
- I see. - I don't know.

1739
01:22:06,603 --> 01:22:09,563
I'm really not sure.

1740
01:22:10,903 --> 01:22:11,903
Right.

1741
01:22:11,904 --> 01:22:14,973
These days,

1742
01:22:15,303 --> 01:22:17,972
I want to meet someone...

1743
01:22:17,973 --> 01:22:20,312
I can rely on.

1744
01:22:20,313 --> 01:22:21,982
I want to find someone I can lean on.

1745
01:22:21,983 --> 01:22:24,951
That's why I'm here.

1746
01:22:24,952 --> 01:22:26,781
Before I came here,

1747
01:22:26,782 --> 01:22:28,022
I usually met someone...

1748
01:22:28,023 --> 01:22:31,622
I adored and took care of...

1749
01:22:31,723 --> 01:22:33,562
rather than someone I could lean on.

1750
01:22:33,563 --> 01:22:35,791
I've never met someone...

1751
01:22:35,792 --> 01:22:39,292
I could completely rely on.

1752
01:22:39,763 --> 01:22:42,063
We don't have much time left.

1753
01:22:43,773 --> 01:22:45,832
Do you want to stay here longer?

1754
01:22:46,572 --> 01:22:48,943
Or do you want to leave quickly?

1755
01:22:50,072 --> 01:22:52,712
I want to stay a little longer...

1756
01:22:53,143 --> 01:22:54,313
than this.

1757
01:22:55,443 --> 01:22:56,853
Do you want to leave early?

1758
01:22:57,313 --> 01:22:59,921
I'm sad that this will be over...

1759
01:22:59,922 --> 01:23:02,682
- and we'll be leaving. - Yes.

1760
01:23:02,683 --> 01:23:06,393
But I don't think I need to spend more time here.

1761
01:23:08,422 --> 01:23:09,962
I think I know what you're saying.

1762
01:23:10,193 --> 01:23:12,733
I think it'd be important...

1763
01:23:13,303 --> 01:23:17,273
to spend time outside the show.

1764
01:23:17,803 --> 01:23:19,902
That's what I felt after coming to Singapore.

1765
01:23:19,903 --> 01:23:20,943
I see.

1766
01:23:23,973 --> 01:23:27,041
It's in a very interesting place.

1767
01:23:27,042 --> 01:23:28,442
I know. My gosh.

1768
01:23:28,443 --> 01:23:30,313
- Oh, my. - This is nice.

1769
01:23:30,613 --> 01:23:35,223
(Ji Won and Jae Hyung at Feast)

1770
01:23:37,992 --> 01:23:39,992
- This is nice. - Right.

1771
01:23:40,193 --> 01:23:42,193
Do you think we might see monkeys?

1772
01:23:42,393 --> 01:23:43,961
- Monkeys? - Yes.

1773
01:23:43,962 --> 01:23:45,492
Should we eat with them?

1774
01:23:45,733 --> 01:23:47,961
- Did you see monkeys? - I saw them earlier.

1775
01:23:47,962 --> 01:23:49,763
Really? I didn't see them.

1776
01:23:49,933 --> 01:23:52,273
I think we often come to a place like this.

1777
01:23:53,002 --> 01:23:55,372
What was the most fun part of yesterday?

1778
01:23:55,643 --> 01:23:57,512
- Our conversations. - Conversations?

1779
01:23:57,513 --> 01:23:59,143
What did you talk about?

1780
01:24:03,613 --> 01:24:05,782
Why did you sigh first?

1781
01:24:05,853 --> 01:24:08,723
- I don't know where to start. - Yes.

1782
01:24:11,952 --> 01:24:13,763
Did you talk about how your mind changed?

1783
01:24:14,992 --> 01:24:17,262
I heard things like that a lot.

1784
01:24:17,263 --> 01:24:20,202
The atmosphere took me over.

1785
01:24:20,403 --> 01:24:21,661
I thought it might happen.

1786
01:24:21,662 --> 01:24:23,161
The strawberry cocktail.

1787
01:24:23,162 --> 01:24:25,002
- This is the strawberry cocktail. - Thank you.

1788
01:24:25,572 --> 01:24:26,672
- Thank you. - Strawberry Prince.

1789
01:24:27,603 --> 01:24:28,643
Strawberry.

1790
01:24:29,303 --> 01:24:31,071
Strawberry Prince has a strawberry drink as expected.

1791
01:24:31,072 --> 01:24:32,072
Is it good?

1792
01:24:32,542 --> 01:24:34,313
Did you talk a lot with Jung Sub?

1793
01:24:34,513 --> 01:24:35,712
What do you think about him?

1794
01:24:36,082 --> 01:24:38,582
Jung Sub? I talked to him...

1795
01:24:38,782 --> 01:24:41,782
when he was having a hard time before.

1796
01:24:42,082 --> 01:24:44,522
I asked if things were better now.

1797
01:24:44,523 --> 01:24:47,822
It seems he still has a lot of thoughts.

1798
01:24:47,962 --> 01:24:49,792
Se Seung...

1799
01:24:50,832 --> 01:24:53,093
didn't send him a text yesterday.

1800
01:24:53,233 --> 01:24:54,962
- Se Seung? I see. - She didn't.

1801
01:24:55,733 --> 01:24:57,232
This is the salad for you.

1802
01:24:57,233 --> 01:24:58,732
It's amazing.

1803
01:24:58,733 --> 01:25:00,473
- Gosh, it's avocado. - Goodness.

1804
01:25:01,303 --> 01:25:02,303
This is awesome.

1805
01:25:02,803 --> 01:25:03,943
- Should I mix it? - Yes.

1806
01:25:05,042 --> 01:25:06,072
It looks good.

1807
01:25:13,882 --> 01:25:17,093
(Thundering)

1808
01:25:17,153 --> 01:25:20,322
Riding the Ferris wheel during thunder...

1809
01:25:20,792 --> 01:25:21,792
would feel weird.

1810
01:25:22,122 --> 01:25:24,733
What do you think about me? Do you feel comfortable?

1811
01:25:25,063 --> 01:25:26,461
Actually, last time...

1812
01:25:26,462 --> 01:25:29,001
- was our first date. - Yes.

1813
01:25:29,002 --> 01:25:31,832
I didn't feel comfortable until we took the Ferris wheel.

1814
01:25:32,502 --> 01:25:35,241
- But when we drew, - Yes.

1815
01:25:35,242 --> 01:25:39,273
you smiled like a girl.

1816
01:25:39,712 --> 01:25:42,342
You looked so bright,

1817
01:25:42,343 --> 01:25:43,512
innocent,

1818
01:25:43,513 --> 01:25:47,322
and energetic.

1819
01:25:48,153 --> 01:25:49,752
It left...

1820
01:25:49,882 --> 01:25:53,862
a lasting impression on me.

1821
01:25:53,863 --> 01:25:57,962
I don't feel very comfortable around you now,

1822
01:25:58,393 --> 01:26:00,603
but it doesn't mean I feel uncomfortable.

1823
01:26:01,763 --> 01:26:04,802
It's just that I don't feel comfortable...

1824
01:26:04,803 --> 01:26:07,942
like when I'm with my friends...

1825
01:26:07,943 --> 01:26:11,672
or people I'm close with.

1826
01:26:12,372 --> 01:26:16,483
That's how I feel around you for sure.

1827
01:26:16,782 --> 01:26:19,951
And we've never lived under the spotlight.

1828
01:26:19,952 --> 01:26:22,652
- Right. - So in an environment where...

1829
01:26:22,653 --> 01:26:23,723
everyone is watching us...

1830
01:26:24,053 --> 01:26:27,062
Two days ago, on our first date, when you said...

1831
01:26:27,063 --> 01:26:30,192
that you thought if you saw me in real life,

1832
01:26:30,193 --> 01:26:33,762
I'd seem more relaxed and more natural,

1833
01:26:33,763 --> 01:26:36,132
I really related to that.

1834
01:26:36,233 --> 01:26:38,372
The same probably goes for you too.

1835
01:26:38,872 --> 01:26:42,542
That's why, on our way here, I said...

1836
01:26:43,973 --> 01:26:45,672
I don't need more time.

1837
01:26:51,013 --> 01:26:54,752
(It began raining.)

1838
01:26:55,053 --> 01:26:56,422
What do you want to do from now on?

1839
01:26:57,353 --> 01:27:00,792
Eventually, I want to produce an idol group.

1840
01:27:01,893 --> 01:27:02,893
K-pop.

1841
01:27:03,093 --> 01:27:04,662
I should start going to the dermatologist again.

1842
01:27:06,662 --> 01:27:08,662
I have to be skinnier to be an idol.

1843
01:27:08,763 --> 01:27:12,172
Of course. You're kind of like...

1844
01:27:15,572 --> 01:27:16,572
What?

1845
01:27:16,872 --> 01:27:18,643
the member who people start liking your group through, but...

1846
01:27:19,072 --> 01:27:20,282
- They quit being our fan? - No.

1847
01:27:21,042 --> 01:27:23,582
It's like they come to your group's fan signing event for you,

1848
01:27:24,582 --> 01:27:27,122
but there they move on to having other members as their biases.

1849
01:27:28,223 --> 01:27:29,322
After having me as their bias?

1850
01:27:29,822 --> 01:27:30,822
Why?

1851
01:27:30,823 --> 01:27:33,723
You'd be their first bias because you're good-looking, but...

1852
01:27:40,462 --> 01:27:41,501
What about this?

1853
01:27:41,502 --> 01:27:43,403
They have other members as their biases first,

1854
01:27:43,733 --> 01:27:44,933
and then they move on to me.

1855
01:27:46,372 --> 01:27:48,273
You'd have to be sweeter for that.

1856
01:27:51,172 --> 01:27:53,513
But I'm not completely unsweet.

1857
01:27:56,143 --> 01:27:57,153
I see.

1858
01:27:58,252 --> 01:28:00,282
How should I send today's message?

1859
01:28:03,252 --> 01:28:04,252
I'm going to let this build-up.

1860
01:28:06,093 --> 01:28:09,162
I haven't really been with a lot of sweet guys.

1861
01:28:09,792 --> 01:28:11,192
When I first moved in,

1862
01:28:11,193 --> 01:28:15,603
I wanted to meet someone who was generous with a heart of gold.

1863
01:28:15,702 --> 01:28:18,132
Someone like an older brother...

1864
01:28:18,702 --> 01:28:20,541
and a dad.

1865
01:28:20,542 --> 01:28:22,143
- So that's why... - Yes.

1866
01:28:23,773 --> 01:28:24,843
So that's why...

1867
01:28:25,742 --> 01:28:26,742
What?

1868
01:28:26,743 --> 01:28:28,712
- Nothing. - Again?

1869
01:28:32,212 --> 01:28:34,652
Yong Woo. I mean, yes, but...

1870
01:28:34,653 --> 01:28:36,282
- he isn't really... - Right?

1871
01:28:38,093 --> 01:28:40,523
He's like a misleading movie trailer.

1872
01:28:41,962 --> 01:28:44,332
He seemed very reliable...

1873
01:28:44,763 --> 01:28:47,032
with an imposing impression.

1874
01:28:47,363 --> 01:28:48,363
He's like...

1875
01:28:48,364 --> 01:28:50,432
But he's actually kind of adorable.

1876
01:28:50,433 --> 01:28:52,831
- Right. - He throws jabs.

1877
01:28:52,832 --> 01:28:54,371
He's probably annoyed...

1878
01:28:54,372 --> 01:28:58,272
because he thought he'd be the most adorable one here, but...

1879
01:28:58,273 --> 01:28:59,313
Right.

1880
01:28:59,412 --> 01:29:01,442
- I was here. - He's actually adorable.

1881
01:29:01,443 --> 01:29:04,813
- He's very wary of me. - I'm like, "I've been deceived."

1882
01:29:05,983 --> 01:29:06,983
I get what you mean.

1883
01:29:07,082 --> 01:29:09,683
He keeps watching me...

1884
01:29:10,122 --> 01:29:11,252
to see what I do.

1885
01:29:11,622 --> 01:29:13,052
You're adorable,

1886
01:29:13,053 --> 01:29:15,792
and my brother took away his role of making food,

1887
01:29:16,962 --> 01:29:18,433
so Yong Woo doesn't know what to do.

1888
01:29:18,962 --> 01:29:21,062
Anyway, I don't think...

1889
01:29:21,063 --> 01:29:23,872
anyone has a heart of gold.

1890
01:29:24,773 --> 01:29:28,943
I guess you have a heart of silver.

1891
01:29:29,072 --> 01:29:31,412
Silver. Silver Park.

1892
01:29:31,542 --> 01:29:33,072
- I like it. - Silver Park.

1893
01:29:33,273 --> 01:29:36,212
Someone with too much of a heart of gold...

1894
01:29:36,983 --> 01:29:39,313
- It won't be easy. - Right.

1895
01:29:39,912 --> 01:29:43,052
You should be with someone you can...

1896
01:29:43,053 --> 01:29:44,193
take hold of.

1897
01:29:46,322 --> 01:29:47,593
Someone I can take hold of.

1898
01:29:50,093 --> 01:29:53,132
Well, I might be saying this because...

1899
01:29:53,933 --> 01:29:57,103
I haven't been with someone like that.

1900
01:29:57,202 --> 01:29:58,532
And there must be a reason...

1901
01:29:58,632 --> 01:30:00,572
I haven't been with someone like that before.

1902
01:30:01,242 --> 01:30:04,742
Who I'm drawn to could be different from who I hope for.

1903
01:30:08,712 --> 01:30:11,912
Does she want to be with someone who's older than sophisticated?

1904
01:30:12,282 --> 01:30:13,723
What does she mean?

1905
01:30:13,822 --> 01:30:16,451
I didn't have an idea of the type of person I wanted to meet here...

1906
01:30:16,452 --> 01:30:17,522
before coming on the show.

1907
01:30:17,523 --> 01:30:19,392
I just thought I'd choose the person...

1908
01:30:19,393 --> 01:30:20,962
who I was drawn to.

1909
01:30:22,723 --> 01:30:25,791
(They were talking about their ideal types.)

1910
01:30:25,792 --> 01:30:28,131
(Having different personalities doesn't matter to me at all.)

1911
01:30:28,132 --> 01:30:29,933
(Having different preferences doesn't matter to me at all either.)

1912
01:30:30,132 --> 01:30:35,903
(Jae Hyung thinks personalities and preferences can be adjusted.)

1913
01:30:36,103 --> 01:30:38,712
For me, it's about that feeling.

1914
01:30:38,813 --> 01:30:40,582
"It's her. This is the one."

1915
01:30:40,943 --> 01:30:43,342
When I get that feeling, I'm totally all-in.

1916
01:30:43,343 --> 01:30:46,752
That's how I am.

1917
01:30:46,853 --> 01:30:49,881
But unlike me, she came on the show...

1918
01:30:49,882 --> 01:30:52,223
with an idea of who she wanted to meet.

1919
01:30:52,292 --> 01:30:55,462
So I realized we were different.

1920
01:31:08,843 --> 01:31:10,541
- What are you thinking about? - What?

1921
01:31:10,542 --> 01:31:12,742
- What are you thinking about? - I zoned out.

1922
01:31:14,882 --> 01:31:17,082
- Do you have a T in your MBTI? - Yes.

1923
01:31:18,553 --> 01:31:19,553
Just zoning out.

1924
01:31:20,483 --> 01:31:23,723
Let's go. Our taxi is here.

1925
01:31:28,263 --> 01:31:29,263
(She hit her head.)

1926
01:31:31,162 --> 01:31:32,162
(She hit her head again.)

1927
01:31:32,832 --> 01:31:34,763
- Gosh. - Are you okay?

1928
01:31:35,233 --> 01:31:36,732
You've never held up an umbrella for someone, have you?

1929
01:31:36,733 --> 01:31:37,733
Are you okay?

1930
01:31:38,773 --> 01:31:40,272
- I have. - You have?

1931
01:31:40,273 --> 01:31:41,473
- Yes. - Be careful.

1932
01:31:42,143 --> 01:31:44,843
(The house in Singapore)

1933
01:31:47,242 --> 01:31:48,983
(He came over to Yun Ha's room.)

1934
01:31:49,183 --> 01:31:51,183
- Ma'am. - Yes?

1935
01:31:52,113 --> 01:31:53,113
What are you up to?

1936
01:31:53,882 --> 01:31:54,922
- I'm relaxing. - Are you going to sleep?

1937
01:31:55,223 --> 01:31:56,683
No, I was asleep.

1938
01:31:56,952 --> 01:31:58,053
I was resting my eyes.

1939
01:31:58,292 --> 01:32:00,251
- I shouldn't sit... - No, sit.

1940
01:32:00,252 --> 01:32:01,792
- on someone else's bed. - It's fine.

1941
01:32:03,023 --> 01:32:04,563
Are you sleepy? Do you want to go to sleep?

1942
01:32:04,962 --> 01:32:06,531
- No, I slept. - I see.

1943
01:32:06,532 --> 01:32:08,403
- Look how messy my hair is. - It seems all right.

1944
01:32:09,702 --> 01:32:10,702
My hair.

1945
01:32:11,332 --> 01:32:12,332
What did you do?

1946
01:32:12,403 --> 01:32:14,443
Cho A said she was hungry,

1947
01:32:14,773 --> 01:32:16,872
- so I made her fried rice. - I see.

1948
01:32:17,172 --> 01:32:18,613
Aren't you hungry?

1949
01:32:19,072 --> 01:32:20,911
- Right now, - You're good?

1950
01:32:20,912 --> 01:32:22,382
I'm not that hungry.

1951
01:32:25,782 --> 01:32:26,982
(Making her bed)

1952
01:32:26,983 --> 01:32:28,422
I should make something for you to eat.

1953
01:32:29,153 --> 01:32:31,193
- Really? - Yes. I'll do it right now.

1954
01:32:31,322 --> 01:32:32,322
Get some rest.

1955
01:32:37,193 --> 01:32:38,832
He must really like her.

1956
01:32:39,032 --> 01:32:41,002
He takes such good care of her.

1957
01:32:41,103 --> 01:32:42,863
Yun Jae likes Yun Ha so much.

1958
01:32:44,103 --> 01:32:46,072
(Yun Jae returns to the kitchen within 5 minutes.)

1959
01:32:47,242 --> 01:32:49,273
I forgot this was spicy. That's a problem.

1960
01:32:49,572 --> 01:32:50,572
It's going to be spicy.

1961
01:32:51,973 --> 01:32:54,382
But I have to use it because of the colour.

1962
01:32:59,553 --> 01:33:01,482
Isn't it tiresome for him?

1963
01:33:01,483 --> 01:33:02,782
He feels like he should do something.

1964
01:33:02,882 --> 01:33:05,952
He's trying to appeal to her with what he does best.

1965
01:33:06,053 --> 01:33:07,063
Right.

1966
01:33:07,662 --> 01:33:09,362
Thanks, Jung Sub.

1967
01:33:09,363 --> 01:33:10,363
(Se Seung and Jung Sub return to the house.)

1968
01:33:11,132 --> 01:33:12,332
What did you do today?

1969
01:33:13,032 --> 01:33:15,063
I talked with Yun Jae.

1970
01:33:15,263 --> 01:33:17,232
- You did? - He seemed troubled.

1971
01:33:17,233 --> 01:33:19,602
- Right. - He said he hoped...

1972
01:33:19,603 --> 01:33:21,042
Ju Yeon wouldn't send a message to him.

1973
01:33:22,072 --> 01:33:25,071
But she did, so he felt bad toward Ju Yeon.

1974
01:33:25,072 --> 01:33:26,072
So?

1975
01:33:26,172 --> 01:33:28,042
He said that was why.

1976
01:33:28,483 --> 01:33:30,212
- I did the right thing, right? - Yes.

1977
01:33:30,952 --> 01:33:35,853
(My first love is already in progress)

1978
01:33:36,422 --> 01:33:37,492
You're in a good mood.

1979
01:33:38,023 --> 01:33:40,252
I had a lot of fun today.

1980
01:33:42,223 --> 01:33:44,262
Did you overcome the rough patch?

1981
01:33:44,263 --> 01:33:45,263
I overcame the rough patch.

1982
01:33:48,063 --> 01:33:50,702
(Ji Won and Jae Hyung are on their way to ride the Ferris wheel.)

1983
01:33:51,332 --> 01:33:54,603
The day we had the chicken fight, Yong Woo said...

1984
01:33:55,143 --> 01:33:56,202
he had a dream.

1985
01:33:56,572 --> 01:33:58,513
He said he dreamed of the final decision day.

1986
01:33:58,872 --> 01:34:00,911
The dream wasn't about everyone's final decision,

1987
01:34:00,912 --> 01:34:02,882
it was about my final decision.

1988
01:34:03,242 --> 01:34:06,081
He said he took a trip into the future...

1989
01:34:06,082 --> 01:34:07,183
and took a peek.

1990
01:34:08,223 --> 01:34:10,491
So I thought, "What is he talking about,"

1991
01:34:10,492 --> 01:34:11,723
but I pretended to be very curious.

1992
01:34:12,622 --> 01:34:14,263
Is he really curious...

1993
01:34:14,462 --> 01:34:17,393
about your decision more than the others'?

1994
01:34:18,292 --> 01:34:19,992
It's not like he dreamed of the others' dreams.

1995
01:34:20,332 --> 01:34:22,632
Why would he dream of your final decision day specifically?

1996
01:34:24,433 --> 01:34:25,502
The Ferris wheel.

1997
01:34:26,002 --> 01:34:27,742
- Amazing. Gosh. - It's right there.

1998
01:34:27,843 --> 01:34:29,042
I'm getting excited all of a sudden.

1999
01:34:29,702 --> 01:34:33,072
(Ji Won and Jae Hyung are at the Singapore Flyer.)

2000
01:34:33,273 --> 01:34:34,343
This is going to be fun.

2001
01:34:35,382 --> 01:34:39,052
(They pull up at the entrance.)

2002
01:34:39,053 --> 01:34:42,023
The ticket office is closed.

2003
01:34:42,523 --> 01:34:44,852
(The Ferris wheel is closed for a while due to bad weather.)

2004
01:34:44,853 --> 01:34:48,162
We were waiting for the Ferris wheel to begin operating again.

2005
01:34:48,563 --> 01:34:51,233
Jae Hyung and I were full of anticipation...

2006
01:34:51,563 --> 01:34:52,763
as we were waiting.

2007
01:34:52,962 --> 01:34:56,462
We did have a fun time at the restaurant,

2008
01:34:56,763 --> 01:34:59,332
but we also talked a lot about other people.

2009
01:34:59,433 --> 01:35:02,772
So I wanted us to have a deep conversation...

2010
01:35:02,773 --> 01:35:05,273
on the Ferris wheel so we could get to know each other better.

2011
01:35:06,313 --> 01:35:09,483
(They finally go to ride the Ferris wheel after waiting.)

2012
01:35:10,582 --> 01:35:12,612
On the escalator, do you prefer standing side by side,

2013
01:35:12,613 --> 01:35:14,483
standing above, or standing below?

2014
01:35:15,353 --> 01:35:17,353
I like standing above.

2015
01:35:17,452 --> 01:35:19,322
I feel like that makes up for the height difference.

2016
01:35:19,952 --> 01:35:21,462
Yes, you're right.

2017
01:35:21,922 --> 01:35:24,593
I like standing below while in a hug.

2018
01:35:24,693 --> 01:35:26,393
- While in a hug? - Yes.

2019
01:35:26,832 --> 01:35:28,063
- Like this? - Yes.

2020
01:35:28,832 --> 01:35:30,462
(Gosh)

2021
01:35:33,733 --> 01:35:34,742
Should we...

2022
01:35:34,803 --> 01:35:36,572
- sit over here? - Okay.

2023
01:35:42,113 --> 01:35:43,143
It's so slow.

2024
01:35:45,282 --> 01:35:46,282
Are you scared?

2025
01:35:46,483 --> 01:35:49,282
I'm not scared. Really.

2026
01:35:49,653 --> 01:35:51,421
I feel like it's nicer because it rained.

2027
01:35:51,422 --> 01:35:52,422
Yes.

2028
01:35:55,693 --> 01:35:57,292
Do you like the rain?

2029
01:35:58,792 --> 01:35:59,832
I like watching it.

2030
01:36:05,532 --> 01:36:06,933
Our reflection.

2031
01:36:07,443 --> 01:36:09,143
Why is your head so big?

2032
01:36:09,603 --> 01:36:11,513
- It is? - Do you see it?

2033
01:36:12,643 --> 01:36:14,582
Which way is Marina Bay Sands?

2034
01:36:17,752 --> 01:36:19,853
Is that it? It's quite far away.

2035
01:36:21,322 --> 01:36:24,292
What? I guess you're not scared.

2036
01:36:24,393 --> 01:36:25,393
I'm holding on to this.

2037
01:36:35,063 --> 01:36:36,701
That's Marina Bay Sands.

2038
01:36:36,702 --> 01:36:37,831
Where?

2039
01:36:37,832 --> 01:36:39,572
- That's it. - Yes.

2040
01:36:39,803 --> 01:36:41,741
- What's that? - What?

2041
01:36:41,742 --> 01:36:43,002
It looks like a cruise.

2042
01:36:43,473 --> 01:36:44,473
That's cool.

2043
01:36:53,912 --> 01:36:56,523
(He puts on music.)

2044
01:36:56,622 --> 01:36:58,252
This feels kind of dreamy.

2045
01:36:59,353 --> 01:37:00,553
- It's nice. - Yes.

2046
01:37:01,763 --> 01:37:04,063
I feel like the presence of music...

2047
01:37:04,893 --> 01:37:06,792
really fills up a space.

2048
01:37:14,172 --> 01:37:15,502
The tune is really nice.

2049
01:37:38,162 --> 01:37:42,132
What's the most beautiful thing you've seen in Singapore?

2050
01:37:55,643 --> 01:37:58,452
The most beautiful thing would be the moon last night.

2051
01:37:59,483 --> 01:38:01,522
- The moon. - The moon was beautiful last night.

2052
01:38:01,523 --> 01:38:02,723
Last night, I didn't...

2053
01:38:02,822 --> 01:38:05,752
I heard the others talk about it,

2054
01:38:06,422 --> 01:38:08,063
but I didn't see the moon last night.

2055
01:38:08,492 --> 01:38:11,331
I told her that the moon I saw with Cho A...

2056
01:38:11,332 --> 01:38:13,693
the previous night was the most beautiful.

2057
01:38:14,403 --> 01:38:17,032
But what I actually wanted to say...

2058
01:38:17,233 --> 01:38:19,032
was "You."

2059
01:38:19,672 --> 01:38:20,973
Yes, but...

2060
01:38:22,973 --> 01:38:26,473
I don't know. The atmosphere was tranquil,

2061
01:38:26,912 --> 01:38:28,613
and I felt very self-conscious.

2062
01:38:29,282 --> 01:38:30,343
I guess I was just...

2063
01:38:32,013 --> 01:38:34,153
lacking courage.

2064
01:38:34,252 --> 01:38:36,381
To be honest,

2065
01:38:36,382 --> 01:38:39,121
throwing compliments like that...

2066
01:38:39,122 --> 01:38:40,393
isn't difficult for me.

2067
01:38:40,893 --> 01:38:43,821
But the fact that doing it to her felt difficult...

2068
01:38:43,822 --> 01:38:48,402
means that I actually developed feelings for her,

2069
01:38:48,403 --> 01:38:51,432
and I think...

2070
01:38:51,433 --> 01:38:53,603
I recognized how I felt.

2071
01:38:53,832 --> 01:38:57,742
But I wasn't able to respond that way.

2072
01:38:58,613 --> 01:39:00,813
I couldn't really focus enough...

2073
01:39:01,013 --> 01:39:03,942
to really respond properly.

2074
01:39:03,943 --> 01:39:06,951
And it probably showed on my expression, my face,

2075
01:39:06,952 --> 01:39:08,983
and the vibes I was giving off.

2076
01:39:14,962 --> 01:39:18,131
Jae Hyung was barely talking.

2077
01:39:18,132 --> 01:39:21,432
"What's the most beautiful thing you've seen in Singapore?"

2078
01:39:21,433 --> 01:39:22,831
I asked him that question.

2079
01:39:22,832 --> 01:39:25,002
He thought about it for a long time,

2080
01:39:25,172 --> 01:39:28,803
and he said the moon he saw the previous night.

2081
01:39:29,343 --> 01:39:32,473
So I was just like, "I see."

2082
01:39:32,643 --> 01:39:35,342
We have this beautiful nightscape in front of us,

2083
01:39:35,343 --> 01:39:39,513
but the moon from the previous night was the most beautiful to him.

2084
01:39:39,653 --> 01:39:43,553
The conversation came to a halt there.

2085
01:39:43,882 --> 01:39:46,122
He didn't attempt...

2086
01:39:47,223 --> 01:39:50,563
to start the conversation again,

2087
01:39:50,962 --> 01:39:53,192
so I just got up.

2088
01:39:53,193 --> 01:39:56,603
And I looked down at the nightscape.

2089
01:40:09,582 --> 01:40:12,853
(The silence between them continues on.)

2090
01:40:15,653 --> 01:40:17,492
What was your favourite part...

2091
01:40:17,893 --> 01:40:21,193
about coming here?

2092
01:40:21,763 --> 01:40:22,893
Singapore?

2093
01:40:23,492 --> 01:40:25,933
No, not Singapore. The show.

2094
01:40:26,063 --> 01:40:29,332
(After a long stretch of silence, Ji Won started a conversation.)

2095
01:40:35,242 --> 01:40:36,343
A sort of...

2096
01:40:42,143 --> 01:40:43,242
self-reflection?

2097
01:40:43,742 --> 01:40:44,882
Self-reflection?

2098
01:40:46,553 --> 01:40:49,422
Are you glad you got to know yourself better?

2099
01:40:50,853 --> 01:40:53,622
Yes. I think there's a lot left,

2100
01:40:57,263 --> 01:40:58,292
but still...

2101
01:40:59,893 --> 01:41:03,701
I got the feeling that he wanted to avoid...

2102
01:41:03,702 --> 01:41:07,303
having more serious conversations.

2103
01:41:07,502 --> 01:41:10,302
Why is that? Is he usually like this?

2104
01:41:10,303 --> 01:41:13,241
Is he someone who doesn't like...

2105
01:41:13,242 --> 01:41:15,613
having things like deep conversations?

2106
01:41:15,813 --> 01:41:18,881
Or maybe the conversation topic...

2107
01:41:18,882 --> 01:41:20,983
isn't necessary to him as it is to me.

2108
01:41:21,082 --> 01:41:24,182
Is Jae Hyung's tendency a lot more different...

2109
01:41:24,183 --> 01:41:26,792
from my own than I thought?

2110
01:41:27,393 --> 01:41:30,062
I think I was caught in a whirlwind of...

2111
01:41:30,063 --> 01:41:31,992
these complex thoughts all at once.

2112
01:41:33,032 --> 01:41:35,702
What are you thinking about? Are you zoning out again?

2113
01:41:36,132 --> 01:41:37,871
No, I was thinking just now.

2114
01:41:37,872 --> 01:41:39,432
What were you thinking about?

2115
01:41:39,433 --> 01:41:40,502
Well,

2116
01:41:42,473 --> 01:41:44,172
I was wondering about...

2117
01:41:46,343 --> 01:41:48,443
how the others must be processing...

2118
01:41:48,712 --> 01:41:52,353
these current situations we're faced with.

2119
01:41:53,613 --> 01:41:56,353
How are you processing it?

2120
01:41:59,393 --> 01:42:03,063
When it came to making decisions, at some point,

2121
01:42:03,393 --> 01:42:06,131
I began centering my thoughts on...

2122
01:42:06,132 --> 01:42:09,662
what might happen in the future.

2123
01:42:09,903 --> 01:42:12,502
But I feel like not thinking that way...

2124
01:42:12,702 --> 01:42:16,671
would be better when I make decisions.

2125
01:42:16,672 --> 01:42:18,143
For me,

2126
01:42:19,412 --> 01:42:23,182
I've been thinking a lot that I want to make a choice...

2127
01:42:23,183 --> 01:42:26,183
that is different from the ones I've made up until now.

2128
01:42:27,252 --> 01:42:30,952
But I'm still not sure what is right for me.

2129
01:42:31,322 --> 01:42:33,523
Do I acknowledge...

2130
01:42:34,193 --> 01:42:36,762
my original self and accept it,

2131
01:42:36,763 --> 01:42:37,792
or do I...

2132
01:42:38,593 --> 01:42:42,262
try harder to go the way...

2133
01:42:42,263 --> 01:42:45,733
I had initially hoped for and was determined about?

2134
01:42:48,872 --> 01:42:49,943
It's hard.

2135
01:42:52,542 --> 01:42:56,983
I've always been with guys who were very different from me.

2136
01:42:57,952 --> 01:43:01,382
There has been a sense of escapist fun and happiness...

2137
01:43:01,622 --> 01:43:03,222
that comes from that,

2138
01:43:03,223 --> 01:43:05,552
but there has also been a sense of emptiness that I haven't been...

2139
01:43:05,553 --> 01:43:07,322
able to resolve for a long time.

2140
01:43:07,353 --> 01:43:11,662
I think I felt that a little in that moment.

2141
01:43:17,933 --> 01:43:19,371
(Their time on the Ferris wheel is coming to an end.)

2142
01:43:19,372 --> 01:43:22,273
This was shorter than I expected.

2143
01:43:22,702 --> 01:43:25,273
Yes. We're back already.

2144
01:43:26,242 --> 01:43:27,813
It was still beautiful.

2145
01:43:30,282 --> 01:43:31,513
- I... - Yes.

2146
01:43:32,653 --> 01:43:34,212
- kind of... - Yes.

2147
01:43:35,882 --> 01:43:37,792
thought it would just be the two of us.

2148
01:43:39,452 --> 01:43:41,363
That's when Jae Hyung said...

2149
01:43:41,593 --> 01:43:44,121
something like he thought it was going to be...

2150
01:43:44,122 --> 01:43:45,692
only us on the Ferris wheel,

2151
01:43:45,693 --> 01:43:47,733
and it was a bit uncomfortable.

2152
01:43:48,162 --> 01:43:51,531
That’s when I realized Jae Hyung is still unfamiliar...

2153
01:43:51,532 --> 01:43:53,371
and uncomfortable with this situation.

2154
01:43:53,372 --> 01:43:56,773
I didn't expect him to feel that way.

2155
01:43:57,072 --> 01:43:59,942
The way he was brusque with me,

2156
01:43:59,943 --> 01:44:02,041
the way he said it was because he was shy...

2157
01:44:02,042 --> 01:44:04,483
when I asked him about it,

2158
01:44:04,613 --> 01:44:07,251
and the way he said he was avoiding...

2159
01:44:07,252 --> 01:44:09,921
having a conversation with me because...

2160
01:44:09,922 --> 01:44:12,892
this whole situation was unfamiliar to him...

2161
01:44:12,893 --> 01:44:15,223
led me to think that...

2162
01:44:15,723 --> 01:44:19,532
I couldn't tell him about how I was feeling.

2163
01:44:27,672 --> 01:44:30,443
(The two are headed back to the house.)

2164
01:44:31,143 --> 01:44:33,843
(Jae Hyung must have been tired. He fell asleep.)

2165
01:44:40,882 --> 01:44:43,081
- Gosh. - Go to sleep.

2166
01:44:43,082 --> 01:44:44,152
- Should I? - Yes.

2167
01:44:44,153 --> 01:44:45,692
- No. - Why not?

2168
01:44:45,693 --> 01:44:46,822
What kind of person falls asleep on a date?

2169
01:44:47,353 --> 01:44:48,562
I'll go to sleep too.

2170
01:44:48,563 --> 01:44:50,063
- Did you sleep too? - Yes.

2171
01:44:51,263 --> 01:44:52,933
Go to sleep. I'll get some sleep too.

2172
01:45:05,843 --> 01:45:08,582
(Jae Hyung fell asleep again.)

2173
01:45:11,013 --> 01:45:14,313
(Ji Won couldn't fall asleep.)

2174
01:45:22,063 --> 01:45:24,023
I had a lot on my mind,

2175
01:45:24,122 --> 01:45:26,131
so I was organizing my thoughts...

2176
01:45:26,132 --> 01:45:27,933
on the ride back.

2177
01:45:28,733 --> 01:45:31,472
The two are at different temperatures.

2178
01:45:31,473 --> 01:45:34,102
I don't think this is warranted, though.

2179
01:45:34,103 --> 01:45:36,502
I think they're all thinking too much.

2180
01:45:36,572 --> 01:45:38,571
Did this happen because of the day before?

2181
01:45:38,572 --> 01:45:40,313
Maybe it's because the final selection is around the corner.

2182
01:45:40,473 --> 01:45:42,443
They're more cautious about every single thing they say.

2183
01:45:42,542 --> 01:45:46,112
That single thing they say might hold a lot of meaning...

2184
01:45:46,113 --> 01:45:47,881
since the time is so short.

2185
01:45:47,882 --> 01:45:49,153
- So every single thing they say... - Right.

2186
01:45:49,353 --> 01:45:52,352
(The house in Singapore)

2187
01:45:52,353 --> 01:45:53,353
- Hi. - Hi.

2188
01:45:53,354 --> 01:45:54,893
- Where have you been? - What's that?

2189
01:45:55,093 --> 01:45:56,161
I bought fruit.

2190
01:45:56,162 --> 01:45:57,961
- Nice. - I also bought coffee.

2191
01:45:57,962 --> 01:45:59,593
- Nice. - Where have you been?

2192
01:45:59,863 --> 01:46:00,863
Out buying fruits.

2193
01:46:00,864 --> 01:46:02,501
- I picked the fruits. - I mean,

2194
01:46:02,502 --> 01:46:04,672
it feels like you went to work and just got back.

2195
01:46:05,773 --> 01:46:09,201
Cheol Hyeon, I bought bananas and flat peaches.

2196
01:46:09,202 --> 01:46:10,242
I see.

2197
01:46:10,473 --> 01:46:12,613
Hey, I wanted to ask you something.

2198
01:46:13,542 --> 01:46:14,542
Close the door.

2199
01:46:19,252 --> 01:46:20,951
"Do you want me to make kimchi?"

2200
01:46:20,952 --> 01:46:22,082
Who sent me that?

2201
01:46:23,422 --> 01:46:24,692
- What? - No, two days ago.

2202
01:46:24,693 --> 01:46:26,553
Who sent me a message?

2203
01:46:27,992 --> 01:46:29,023
It was Yong Woo.

2204
01:46:29,962 --> 01:46:30,962
I see.

2205
01:46:32,032 --> 01:46:33,831
"Do you want me to make kimchi?"

2206
01:46:33,832 --> 01:46:36,032
Why would Yun Jae say that?

2207
01:46:36,233 --> 01:46:37,501
I'm saying it wasn't Yun Jae.

2208
01:46:37,502 --> 01:46:39,232
You said Yong Woo sent me the message.

2209
01:46:39,233 --> 01:46:41,502
- Right. That's weird, though. - I know.

2210
01:46:43,103 --> 01:46:44,103
Why are you upset?

2211
01:46:46,773 --> 01:46:48,042
You were asleep for a long time.

2212
01:46:48,943 --> 01:46:50,082
I got a lot of deep sleep.

2213
01:46:51,483 --> 01:46:54,553
(From morning to evening, Yun Jae makes kimchi fried rice.)

2214
01:46:54,922 --> 01:46:57,251
Yun Jae's always diligent.

2215
01:46:57,252 --> 01:46:59,593
- Yun Jae? - I should go cheer him on.

2216
01:47:00,053 --> 01:47:02,292
Yun Jae, are you making kimchi fried rice today?

2217
01:47:02,492 --> 01:47:04,992
- Yes. - I've been really craving it.

2218
01:47:05,193 --> 01:47:06,233
Okay.

2219
01:47:07,063 --> 01:47:09,032
We have to eat tofu with kimchi too.

2220
01:47:09,863 --> 01:47:11,202
We're having tofu with kimchi.

2221
01:47:11,303 --> 01:47:12,702
- We'll grill some meat too. - Gosh, that's insane.

2222
01:47:15,273 --> 01:47:17,201
- Let's do it again today. - What?

2223
01:47:17,202 --> 01:47:18,742
We'll do it again.

2224
01:47:18,912 --> 01:47:19,972
- Talk? - Yes.

2225
01:47:19,973 --> 01:47:22,242
- Sure. Let's talk today. - All right.

2226
01:47:24,712 --> 01:47:27,411
Do you want to go upstairs real quick?

2227
01:47:27,412 --> 01:47:28,422
Yes.

2228
01:47:28,853 --> 01:47:30,822
- We'll be back, Yun Jae. - Okay.

2229
01:47:31,322 --> 01:47:32,751
I'll be feeding the kids.

2230
01:47:32,752 --> 01:47:33,752
Okay.

2231
01:47:33,992 --> 01:47:35,192
Talk about what?

2232
01:47:35,193 --> 01:47:36,421
- Talk? - Again?

2233
01:47:36,422 --> 01:47:37,562
I'm so curious.

2234
01:47:37,563 --> 01:47:39,291
I'm curious.

2235
01:47:39,292 --> 01:47:41,131
- Right. - It's only been a day, right?

2236
01:47:41,132 --> 01:47:42,132
- Yes. - Right.

2237
01:47:42,133 --> 01:47:43,832
I can't even imagine.

2238
01:47:44,202 --> 01:47:45,672
I can't even guess.

2239
01:47:46,803 --> 01:47:48,972
The confusion I had felt...

2240
01:47:48,973 --> 01:47:51,242
subsided a little,

2241
01:47:51,643 --> 01:47:54,541
so I thought I could talk about how I feel and think...

2242
01:47:54,542 --> 01:47:56,782
more calmly and steadily.

2243
01:47:57,242 --> 01:47:59,113
I was glad when he suggested it.

2244
01:48:01,483 --> 01:48:03,082
(She takes out the flat peaches she bought earlier.)

2245
01:48:06,322 --> 01:48:07,593
Have some peaches.

2246
01:48:07,893 --> 01:48:11,093
You went out and bought peaches?

2247
01:48:11,693 --> 01:48:13,362
You like peaches.

2248
01:48:13,363 --> 01:48:16,662
Peaches and watermelons are my favourites.

2249
01:48:16,962 --> 01:48:19,871
- I bought them for you. - You did?

2250
01:48:19,872 --> 01:48:21,843
Really? Thanks.

2251
01:48:22,572 --> 01:48:23,803
I'll have them after dinner.

2252
01:48:26,943 --> 01:48:30,013
What I said yesterday...

2253
01:48:30,683 --> 01:48:32,553
- What I intended to say was... - Yes.

2254
01:48:32,683 --> 01:48:34,552
that I wasn't trying to send a message to another person,

2255
01:48:34,553 --> 01:48:36,852
but I might not end up sending it to the person I always have.

2256
01:48:36,853 --> 01:48:39,222
- I see. - But I didn't want you to...

2257
01:48:39,223 --> 01:48:41,292
find out later because I didn't send it to you.

2258
01:48:41,763 --> 01:48:44,462
So I told you upfront, and that's what happened.

2259
01:48:45,393 --> 01:48:47,662
I've kind of been sending messages to you out of inertia,

2260
01:48:48,733 --> 01:48:51,502
but I didn't send it to you for the first time yesterday.

2261
01:48:52,172 --> 01:48:54,272
That situation was kind of hard for me.

2262
01:48:54,273 --> 01:48:55,542
I see.

2263
01:48:56,643 --> 01:49:00,013
It wasn't Cho A or someone else.

2264
01:49:00,372 --> 01:49:03,313
It's been Cho A or no one.

2265
01:49:04,143 --> 01:49:06,852
I'm not at "no one." It's more like I'm at "or."

2266
01:49:06,853 --> 01:49:09,451
I'm at "or" right now,

2267
01:49:09,452 --> 01:49:11,052
so I wanted to let you know about it.

2268
01:49:11,053 --> 01:49:12,553
I see.

2269
01:49:12,593 --> 01:49:16,462
When he said it's been Cho A or no one for him,

2270
01:49:16,763 --> 01:49:20,762
I felt relieved upon realizing that...

2271
01:49:20,763 --> 01:49:24,302
his feelings have at least been headed toward the same direction...

2272
01:49:24,303 --> 01:49:27,131
as the feelings I've had up until now.

2273
01:49:27,132 --> 01:49:30,773
I guess I was kind of shocked...

2274
01:49:31,002 --> 01:49:33,041
in that moment.

2275
01:49:33,042 --> 01:49:34,942
I came to the conclusion...

2276
01:49:34,943 --> 01:49:37,343
that there was someone else for him.

2277
01:49:37,712 --> 01:49:39,952
Hearing him say that wasn't the case...

2278
01:49:40,053 --> 01:49:42,382
made me feel relieved again,

2279
01:49:42,582 --> 01:49:46,723
but it also made me feel kind of anxious.

2280
01:49:48,593 --> 01:49:51,222
Last night, I just had to tell you quickly beforehand.

2281
01:49:51,223 --> 01:49:52,492
I see.

2282
01:49:53,593 --> 01:49:57,363
Was there a reason that made you feel urgent...

2283
01:49:58,403 --> 01:50:00,403
enough to tell me that quickly?

2284
01:50:02,143 --> 01:50:03,943
There's not much time.

2285
01:50:04,403 --> 01:50:06,372
There's not much time, but we still have a few days.

2286
01:50:07,773 --> 01:50:10,483
So I thought telling you as soon as I could...

2287
01:50:11,582 --> 01:50:12,882
would be better for you.

2288
01:50:14,882 --> 01:50:15,983
I see.

2289
01:50:16,353 --> 01:50:18,752
I thought maybe something good could happen in your situation.

2290
01:50:19,322 --> 01:50:23,292
Because it was as if the others...

2291
01:50:23,492 --> 01:50:25,732
were all thinking that we were official,

2292
01:50:25,733 --> 01:50:27,291
enough to say things like...

2293
01:50:27,292 --> 01:50:29,602
you and I seemed like newlyweds.

2294
01:50:29,603 --> 01:50:30,933
I see.

2295
01:50:32,273 --> 01:50:34,171
I guess that was on my mind a little too.

2296
01:50:34,172 --> 01:50:35,273
I see.

2297
01:50:38,242 --> 01:50:42,712
So what caused you to have a change of heart?

2298
01:50:46,613 --> 01:50:50,483
In the beginning, we've had short dates.

2299
01:50:50,822 --> 01:50:53,322
And as we started spending more time together,

2300
01:50:54,193 --> 01:50:56,393
I think I noticed our differences.

2301
01:50:56,523 --> 01:50:58,962
I noticed the good aspects, and I noticed our differences.

2302
01:51:00,462 --> 01:51:01,831
If your change of heart...

2303
01:51:01,832 --> 01:51:05,632
came from our differences like you said,

2304
01:51:06,002 --> 01:51:09,502
we can make adjustments.

2305
01:51:09,843 --> 01:51:11,843
That's right. I wanted to say that too.

2306
01:51:11,943 --> 01:51:14,313
To be more specific...

2307
01:51:15,143 --> 01:51:18,153
When we had short dates,

2308
01:51:18,813 --> 01:51:21,523
I wanted to go on longer dates.

2309
01:51:22,752 --> 01:51:24,722
But we spent two days together.

2310
01:51:24,723 --> 01:51:26,593
- We spent 24 hours together. - Yes.

2311
01:51:26,992 --> 01:51:28,693
Back then, to be honest...

2312
01:51:32,162 --> 01:51:33,862
"I will be able to..."

2313
01:51:33,863 --> 01:51:35,303
"feel a strong attraction..."

2314
01:51:35,832 --> 01:51:36,903
"toward her, right?"

2315
01:51:37,532 --> 01:51:38,933
I had that expectation.

2316
01:51:40,903 --> 01:51:43,372
But even as time passed,

2317
01:51:44,202 --> 01:51:47,072
excitement gave way to comfort.

2318
01:51:47,372 --> 01:51:50,882
I could only sense that you were a nice person.

2319
01:51:51,483 --> 01:51:55,382
"What? Is this a good emotion to feel?"

2320
01:51:55,723 --> 01:51:56,821
"Is everything okay?"

2321
01:51:56,822 --> 01:52:00,491
I am someone who prefers the mix...

2322
01:52:00,492 --> 01:52:03,763
of tension, fun, and things like that.

2323
01:52:04,263 --> 01:52:07,562
In the moments when I thought that I would feel...

2324
01:52:07,563 --> 01:52:08,803
a stronger attraction,

2325
01:52:09,702 --> 01:52:12,973
I could only sense that you were a nice person.

2326
01:52:13,832 --> 01:52:16,273
Those moments brought confusion.

2327
01:52:17,443 --> 01:52:19,872
We are now at a point where we are getting to know each other,

2328
01:52:20,843 --> 01:52:23,212
but I am feeling different emotions.

2329
01:52:24,443 --> 01:52:26,412
I don't think it's your fault.

2330
01:52:27,053 --> 01:52:28,822
This situation simply came from my thoughts.

2331
01:52:31,282 --> 01:52:33,522
I couldn't turn away...

2332
01:52:33,523 --> 01:52:34,723
from my honest feelings.

2333
01:52:36,063 --> 01:52:39,563
In a sense,

2334
01:52:40,233 --> 01:52:42,531
I longed for the dates...

2335
01:52:42,532 --> 01:52:45,702
for this moment.

2336
01:53:02,223 --> 01:53:03,282
Is that so?

2337
01:53:07,952 --> 01:53:08,992
I see.

2338
01:53:12,662 --> 01:53:15,933
It felt like a cruel moment.

2339
01:53:17,332 --> 01:53:21,643
"Was I the only one who felt those emotions?"

2340
01:53:22,603 --> 01:53:25,472
I was thankful that he had...

2341
01:53:25,473 --> 01:53:28,443
a polite talk with me.

2342
01:53:29,212 --> 01:53:31,512
But it felt a bit cruel...

2343
01:53:31,513 --> 01:53:34,252
that he was telling me those things...

2344
01:53:34,752 --> 01:53:37,822
when we didn't have much time left.

2345
01:53:43,863 --> 01:53:46,393
I understand it now. I see.

2346
01:53:48,832 --> 01:53:52,473
That means your worry comes...

2347
01:53:52,572 --> 01:53:55,071
from your instincts,

2348
01:53:55,072 --> 01:53:57,943
not your efforts.

2349
01:53:58,542 --> 01:53:59,911
- That's right. - Yes.

2350
01:53:59,912 --> 01:54:02,582
That's right. It has to do more with my instincts.

2351
01:54:03,382 --> 01:54:07,411
To be honest, I felt that as well when I went on dates...

2352
01:54:07,412 --> 01:54:08,822
with other people.

2353
01:54:10,782 --> 01:54:14,093
It isn't something you can force by making an effort.

2354
01:54:14,593 --> 01:54:17,393
- That's right. - So I feel a bit sad.

2355
01:54:17,893 --> 01:54:20,292
What you said is the key point.

2356
01:54:21,032 --> 01:54:23,803
I thought I shouldn't force myself...

2357
01:54:24,132 --> 01:54:26,303
to bottle up and bury these feelings...

2358
01:54:26,803 --> 01:54:29,273
and pretend like everything is nice...

2359
01:54:30,643 --> 01:54:32,572
for the result and my image.

2360
01:54:34,072 --> 01:54:36,082
I felt like showing my honest side...

2361
01:54:36,513 --> 01:54:38,013
was my respect for you.

2362
01:54:39,983 --> 01:54:42,121
When I look back on this moment...

2363
01:54:42,122 --> 01:54:43,452
much later,

2364
01:54:44,053 --> 01:54:45,553
I will know that I did the right thing...

2365
01:54:45,853 --> 01:54:48,153
by not lying to you.

2366
01:54:51,122 --> 01:54:52,532
I see.

2367
01:55:00,473 --> 01:55:05,513
I want to know if the change in your emotions is solid.

2368
01:55:05,712 --> 01:55:08,072
Did your feelings change for certain?

2369
01:55:09,412 --> 01:55:10,483
No. It's just that...

2370
01:55:11,042 --> 01:55:13,053
my direction went from you...

2371
01:55:13,153 --> 01:55:15,012
to neutral.

2372
01:55:15,013 --> 01:55:18,322
I just went back to how I was on the first day.

2373
01:55:19,292 --> 01:55:22,162
"I am back to the beginning, so she isn't the one."

2374
01:55:22,822 --> 01:55:25,492
"I will definitely choose someone else."

2375
01:55:25,832 --> 01:55:26,962
It isn't like that.

2376
01:55:27,992 --> 01:55:29,763
- So it isn't set in stone. - No.

2377
01:55:32,303 --> 01:55:35,072
I wasn't conveying that I completely ruled out Cho A...

2378
01:55:35,572 --> 01:55:39,613
and that I wouldn't feel any attraction toward her.

2379
01:55:40,013 --> 01:55:42,082
The attraction I felt toward her...

2380
01:55:42,183 --> 01:55:43,742
didn't become bigger.

2381
01:55:43,843 --> 01:55:46,752
That was why I went back to the first day.

2382
01:55:47,813 --> 01:55:50,621
Since he told me honestly,

2383
01:55:50,622 --> 01:55:51,892
a part of me went,

2384
01:55:51,893 --> 01:55:55,322
"He is being completely true..."

2385
01:55:55,662 --> 01:55:57,962
"to these moments."

2386
01:55:58,532 --> 01:56:00,693
But I do hope...

2387
01:56:01,363 --> 01:56:05,171
that his decision would be...

2388
01:56:05,172 --> 01:56:06,532
temporary.

2389
01:56:10,273 --> 01:56:11,542
I see.

2390
01:56:19,212 --> 01:56:22,023
Did I ever make your heart flutter?

2391
01:56:30,292 --> 01:56:32,433
My name is Yong Woo.

2392
01:56:32,933 --> 01:56:35,062
- Yong Woo. - Yes, my name is Yong Woo.

2393
01:56:35,063 --> 01:56:36,103
It's nice to meet you.

2394
01:56:37,563 --> 01:56:40,371
- What is everyone's name? - I am Cho A.

2395
01:56:40,372 --> 01:56:41,372
- Cho A. - Yes.

2396
01:56:44,072 --> 01:56:47,242
I am beginning to learn a nice way to say goodbye.

2397
01:56:48,513 --> 01:56:50,183
A nice way to say goodbye.

2398
01:56:50,813 --> 01:56:53,412
Do you now know a nice way...

2399
01:56:55,013 --> 01:56:56,853
to say goodbye?

2400
01:56:59,952 --> 01:57:01,122
- Thank you. - All right.

2401
01:57:01,422 --> 01:57:04,593
- We took photos of each other. - I see.

2402
01:57:07,162 --> 01:57:08,291
Thank you.

2403
01:57:08,292 --> 01:57:10,363
It was like a confession of love.

2404
01:57:11,032 --> 01:57:12,433
How cool.

2405
01:57:13,433 --> 01:57:16,143
Did I ever make your heart flutter?

2406
01:57:17,872 --> 01:57:19,912
That goes...

2407
01:57:20,872 --> 01:57:22,042
without saying.

2408
01:57:23,643 --> 01:57:25,183
That was why...

2409
01:57:25,712 --> 01:57:27,212
I made an effort.

2410
01:57:40,662 --> 01:57:42,202
Maybe we shouldn't go on dates.

2411
01:57:43,502 --> 01:57:46,032
Shall we pretend not to know each other?

2412
01:57:46,702 --> 01:57:49,303
Shall we pretend to be strangers? We did too many things together.

2413
01:57:50,502 --> 01:57:52,242
We did too many things together in a short amount of time.

2414
01:57:53,672 --> 01:57:54,672
All right.

2415
01:58:01,082 --> 01:58:03,322
Shall we go downstairs and eat something?

2416
01:58:04,683 --> 01:58:05,723
Okay.

2417
01:58:13,162 --> 01:58:15,763
- I have something for you. - What is it?

2418
01:58:16,233 --> 01:58:18,832
- We rode the ferry together. - Yes.

2419
01:58:18,933 --> 01:58:22,071
The scenery was very beautiful back then.

2420
01:58:22,072 --> 01:58:23,571
- Right. - I bought it for you.

2421
01:58:23,572 --> 01:58:25,202
- It's where... - Yes.

2422
01:58:25,613 --> 01:58:26,911
- we went together. - Yes.

2423
01:58:26,912 --> 01:58:28,042
All right.

2424
01:58:28,782 --> 01:58:29,782
Thank you.

2425
01:58:31,212 --> 01:58:33,012
I wondered if I shouldn't give it to him...

2426
01:58:33,013 --> 01:58:35,153
since it could have been burdensome.

2427
01:58:35,553 --> 01:58:37,821
But I thought that I should let him know how I felt,

2428
01:58:37,822 --> 01:58:41,422
so I gave it to him and said that I bought it for him.

2429
01:58:41,962 --> 01:58:44,393
In a sense, I was giving up.

2430
01:58:44,863 --> 01:58:47,661
I was... I was so upset.

2431
01:58:47,662 --> 01:58:49,162
"How could he be like that?"

2432
01:58:49,763 --> 01:58:51,832
I wanted to be coolheaded, but I couldn't be like that.

2433
01:58:52,572 --> 01:58:55,372
I hated seeing myself like that.

2434
01:58:55,742 --> 01:58:58,242
It was like that.

2435
01:59:06,282 --> 01:59:08,452
She must be upset.

2436
01:59:12,053 --> 01:59:13,752
(Cheol Hyeon is at the swimming pool.)

2437
01:59:13,853 --> 01:59:15,393
- Are those fruits? - Okay.

2438
01:59:17,093 --> 01:59:19,392
- I had a talk with Yong Woo. - Yes.

2439
01:59:19,393 --> 01:59:21,662
During my conversation with Yong Woo yesterday,

2440
01:59:21,763 --> 01:59:24,961
my understanding was that he fell...

2441
01:59:24,962 --> 01:59:25,973
for someone else.

2442
01:59:26,733 --> 01:59:29,103
He told me that someone else made his heart flutter.

2443
01:59:29,603 --> 01:59:31,473
But it wasn't like that.

2444
01:59:31,843 --> 01:59:34,172
He didn't fall for someone else.

2445
01:59:34,912 --> 01:59:36,282
But he is in a neutral state.

2446
01:59:37,412 --> 01:59:39,853
I am sure he has his own style, but I find it frustrating.

2447
01:59:41,653 --> 01:59:46,023
He used to feel attraction toward me,

2448
01:59:46,292 --> 01:59:49,122
but he doesn't feel it anymore.

2449
01:59:49,922 --> 01:59:52,262
Not much time remains,

2450
01:59:52,263 --> 01:59:54,432
so he wants to feel excitement.

2451
01:59:54,433 --> 01:59:55,433
I think that's what it is.

2452
01:59:55,434 --> 01:59:56,562
- Let's eat. - Okay.

2453
01:59:56,563 --> 01:59:57,803
Are those flat peaches?

2454
01:59:58,063 --> 01:59:59,773
- Where did you get them? - Cho A brought them.

2455
02:00:00,132 --> 02:00:01,202
They are so tasty.

2456
02:00:03,143 --> 02:00:04,143
Aren't they tasty?

2457
02:00:04,144 --> 02:00:05,972
- Cho A, thank you so much. - They are so tasty.

2458
02:00:05,973 --> 02:00:07,541
There are more fruits in the fridge.

2459
02:00:07,542 --> 02:00:10,041
- Really? I love them the most. - In the fridge?

2460
02:00:10,042 --> 02:00:11,081
- Flat peaches? - Yes.

2461
02:00:11,082 --> 02:00:12,183
There is another pack.

2462
02:00:13,752 --> 02:00:14,952
Did you buy fruits?

2463
02:00:15,053 --> 02:00:18,483
Yes. I brought cherry tomatoes and other things.

2464
02:00:18,752 --> 02:00:20,353
- You emptied the fruit shop. - Yes.

2465
02:00:27,462 --> 02:00:28,763
I heard that you bought kimchi.

2466
02:00:28,863 --> 02:00:29,863
Yes. I did it in the morning.

2467
02:00:30,063 --> 02:00:32,072
It looked like everyone needed kimchi.

2468
02:00:33,332 --> 02:00:35,273
I was happy to see kimchi.

2469
02:00:35,943 --> 02:00:37,773
I was really craving it.

2470
02:00:42,382 --> 02:00:43,782
I wondered if I should make it, but I bought it.

2471
02:00:45,582 --> 02:00:47,282
Do you know how to make kimchi?

2472
02:00:47,912 --> 02:00:49,321
- Not at all. - Not at all?

2473
02:00:49,322 --> 02:00:51,853
No. I want to learn later.

2474
02:01:02,032 --> 02:01:04,062
(Ji Won and Jae Hyung are close to arriving at home.)

2475
02:01:04,063 --> 02:01:05,903
I think we are nearly there.

2476
02:01:06,473 --> 02:01:07,473
Right.

2477
02:01:08,403 --> 02:01:10,042
- Ji Won. - Yes?

2478
02:01:10,303 --> 02:01:11,303
The moon.

2479
02:01:14,343 --> 02:01:15,343
I can't see it.

2480
02:01:19,853 --> 02:01:20,853
Do you see it?

2481
02:01:21,483 --> 02:01:22,483
It got covered.

2482
02:01:40,403 --> 02:01:41,872
You are back.

2483
02:01:42,273 --> 02:01:44,802
- Hey. - You are back.

2484
02:01:44,803 --> 02:01:46,412
- We are back. - You are back.

2485
02:01:47,143 --> 02:01:48,442
- Hi. - Hello.

2486
02:01:48,443 --> 02:01:51,082
- Ji Won, you look different today. - Hi.

2487
02:01:51,443 --> 02:01:52,813
- Did you take out contact lenses? - Contact lenses.

2488
02:01:53,712 --> 02:01:54,912
How did you know?

2489
02:01:55,013 --> 02:01:57,182
- Ji Won, you look much prettier. - Really?

2490
02:01:57,183 --> 02:01:58,582
- Yes. - Isn't it too late to say that?

2491
02:02:01,322 --> 02:02:04,122
- I am so tired. - Was the weather okay?

2492
02:02:04,223 --> 02:02:05,223
It was okay.

2493
02:02:05,224 --> 02:02:07,661
- Jae Hyung, are you okay? - Today, we...

2494
02:02:07,662 --> 02:02:09,332
Why does the golden child look so exhausted?

2495
02:02:09,532 --> 02:02:11,462
What did you do with my child today?

2496
02:02:13,502 --> 02:02:16,302
We wanted to ride the Ferris wheel, but it rained.

2497
02:02:16,303 --> 02:02:18,042
We had the wait...

2498
02:02:18,143 --> 02:02:20,843
because the Ferris wheel stopped running.

2499
02:02:20,943 --> 02:02:22,313
- So... - Did you ride it in the end?

2500
02:02:22,412 --> 02:02:23,613
Yes, we did.

2501
02:02:27,653 --> 02:02:31,522
(You have 2 days before making the final decision.)

2502
02:02:31,523 --> 02:02:34,653
(Who made your heart flutter today?)

2503
02:02:42,363 --> 02:02:45,332
I was going to keep it short like the usual,

2504
02:02:45,433 --> 02:02:48,002
but I wrote about today as much as possible.

2505
02:02:49,572 --> 02:02:52,672
I was the most curious about Jae Hyung's honest thoughts.

2506
02:02:53,013 --> 02:02:56,412
Was he ever torn between me and Ji Won?

2507
02:03:01,153 --> 02:03:03,252
I wish Yun Ha would message me, to be honest.

2508
02:03:16,632 --> 02:03:19,233
Today's message was the hardest for me.

2509
02:03:19,702 --> 02:03:21,872
I felt like I had lost my direction.

2510
02:03:22,202 --> 02:03:23,701
(To Yong Woo)

2511
02:03:23,702 --> 02:03:25,403
(To Yong)

2512
02:03:27,872 --> 02:03:29,842
(2 days before the final decision,)

2513
02:03:29,843 --> 02:03:31,912
(to whom did they deliver their feelings?)

2514
02:03:32,912 --> 02:03:36,153
(Everyone's feelings have been sent.)

2515
02:03:37,752 --> 02:03:38,893
Are your feet okay?

2516
02:03:39,353 --> 02:03:41,193
Yes, they improved a lot.

2517
02:03:41,422 --> 02:03:43,292
I am thinking about going for a swim.

2518
02:03:43,622 --> 02:03:44,992
- It's waterproof. - Is it okay to swim?

2519
02:03:45,093 --> 02:03:47,662
The doctor put a waterproof bandage on it.

2520
02:03:57,502 --> 02:04:01,443
(Sparrow Se Seung, today's date was the best.)

2521
02:04:04,683 --> 02:04:06,712
I sent it to Se Seung.

2522
02:04:07,113 --> 02:04:08,982
It seemed like...

2523
02:04:08,983 --> 02:04:10,382
Se Seung was chirping today.

2524
02:04:10,822 --> 02:04:14,023
"Sparrow Se Seung, today's date was the best."

2525
02:04:14,622 --> 02:04:15,763
I sent her that.

2526
02:04:20,733 --> 02:04:24,201
(I want to remember every moment we spent together.)

2527
02:04:24,202 --> 02:04:27,632
(Especially the moment we fell together today!)

2528
02:04:29,343 --> 02:04:30,671
Jung Sub told me...

2529
02:04:30,672 --> 02:04:33,443
that he was very nervous at first.

2530
02:04:33,843 --> 02:04:38,343
(My attention was on you, so I forgot about my nerves.)

2531
02:04:38,483 --> 02:04:40,381
(Why? Were you worried about me?)

2532
02:04:40,382 --> 02:04:41,382
(Yes.)

2533
02:04:41,383 --> 02:04:43,523
When he told me that worrying about me...

2534
02:04:43,622 --> 02:04:46,751
made him forget about his nerves,

2535
02:04:46,752 --> 02:04:49,063
his words touched me deeply.

2536
02:04:49,492 --> 02:04:53,031
I wanted to remember that moment...

2537
02:04:53,032 --> 02:04:54,193
forever.

2538
02:04:59,303 --> 02:05:02,872
(I am sorry that I was a bit sullen in the morning.)

2539
02:05:04,473 --> 02:05:06,871
I thought, "I shouldn't be like this."

2540
02:05:06,872 --> 02:05:09,442
I decided to keep doing things...

2541
02:05:09,443 --> 02:05:10,683
the same way.

2542
02:05:11,343 --> 02:05:12,353
I decided to keep going.

2543
02:05:13,082 --> 02:05:14,912
Even if there is no feedback,

2544
02:05:15,582 --> 02:05:16,822
I will message Yun Ha.

2545
02:05:39,242 --> 02:05:43,183
(Thank you for making dinner.)

2546
02:05:43,582 --> 02:05:45,241
It's Cho A.

2547
02:05:45,242 --> 02:05:46,652
- It might be Yun Ha. - It can be anyone.

2548
02:05:46,653 --> 02:05:47,951
- There are too many options. - We don't know who it is.

2549
02:05:47,952 --> 02:05:49,022
- Yun Ha? - I think it's Cho A.

2550
02:05:49,023 --> 02:05:50,421
- It's Cho A. - Cho A.

2551
02:05:50,422 --> 02:05:51,881
He made dinner for everyone.

2552
02:05:51,882 --> 02:05:53,523
- You are right. - There is no way of knowing.

2553
02:05:54,122 --> 02:05:57,023
(Thank you for making dinner.)

2554
02:05:58,792 --> 02:06:00,393
I sent it to Yun Jae.

2555
02:06:01,733 --> 02:06:03,232
(This afternoon)

2556
02:06:03,233 --> 02:06:04,233
Yun Ha.

2557
02:06:04,632 --> 02:06:06,172
I made jjigae. Eat it later.

2558
02:06:06,433 --> 02:06:07,933
Really? Thank you.

2559
02:06:08,632 --> 02:06:10,472
I couldn't make it properly since there were no ingredients.

2560
02:06:10,473 --> 02:06:13,943
Okay. Thank you. I will enjoy it.

2561
02:06:14,843 --> 02:06:15,843
All right.

2562
02:06:16,443 --> 02:06:18,183
Let's fry eggs and sausages too.

2563
02:06:18,483 --> 02:06:21,113
I couldn't get the taste right since I lacked some ingredients.

2564
02:06:21,582 --> 02:06:23,053
It looks tasty.

2565
02:06:23,653 --> 02:06:24,683
Sit down.

2566
02:06:25,653 --> 02:06:26,653
How's the food?

2567
02:06:27,723 --> 02:06:28,723
It's tasty.

2568
02:06:29,263 --> 02:06:30,263
It's so tasty.

2569
02:06:31,563 --> 02:06:34,063
Eat the solid ingredients.

2570
02:06:37,702 --> 02:06:40,303
He always stays the same.

2571
02:06:41,172 --> 02:06:43,702
I am so thankful for him.

2572
02:06:44,343 --> 02:06:48,042
In any case, both of us felt uncomfortable during the day.

2573
02:06:48,172 --> 02:06:51,343
I was a bit relieved that Yun Ha messaged me.

2574
02:06:51,983 --> 02:06:54,113
(Yun Jae chose your sibling.)

2575
02:06:56,853 --> 02:06:58,252
(What?)

2576
02:07:01,252 --> 02:07:04,622
(Yun Ha chose your sibling.)

2577
02:07:07,393 --> 02:07:09,962
I was very relieved.

2578
02:07:10,332 --> 02:07:11,863
Thank goodness.

2579
02:07:17,172 --> 02:07:20,412
(Did you have fun today?)

2580
02:07:22,542 --> 02:07:23,983
I was disappointed.

2581
02:07:24,113 --> 02:07:26,952
I felt a bit... Does she feel pressured?

2582
02:07:31,483 --> 02:07:32,892
(It was fun today.)

2583
02:07:32,893 --> 02:07:34,392
(Let's have fun next time as well.)

2584
02:07:34,393 --> 02:07:36,393
(You must be tired, so sleep well.)

2585
02:07:37,863 --> 02:07:39,393
I sent it to Ji Won.

2586
02:07:40,132 --> 02:07:42,702
As we rode the Ferris wheel,

2587
02:07:43,032 --> 02:07:45,201
I couldn't answer the questions...

2588
02:07:45,202 --> 02:07:48,772
that could have shown her who I was as a person.

2589
02:07:48,773 --> 02:07:50,202
It weighed heavily on my mind,

2590
02:07:51,242 --> 02:07:55,572
so I wanted to put some effort into the message.

2591
02:07:56,313 --> 02:08:00,282
(Jae Hyung was torn after sending the message.)

2592
02:08:00,853 --> 02:08:04,782
(He changed the message so that it was longer.)

2593
02:08:05,183 --> 02:08:08,951
I wanted to make an effort.

2594
02:08:08,952 --> 02:08:11,263
Usually, I send a cheerful message.

2595
02:08:11,363 --> 02:08:14,763
But that day, I didn't want to do the same.

2596
02:08:15,263 --> 02:08:18,632
(Jae Hyung and Cheol Hyeon chose your sibling.)

2597
02:08:20,132 --> 02:08:22,202
(To whom do you think your sister sent the message?)

2598
02:08:22,303 --> 02:08:23,803
I think she sent it to Jae Hyung.

2599
02:08:24,242 --> 02:08:27,672
To be honest, I was going through my emergency.

2600
02:08:28,313 --> 02:08:30,642
So I didn't give much thought to her situation.

2601
02:08:30,643 --> 02:08:33,882
I simply thought, "I bet she sent it to Jae Hyung."

2602
02:08:41,752 --> 02:08:44,161
(You must be tired today,)

2603
02:08:44,162 --> 02:08:46,563
(but would you give me some time to talk?)

2604
02:08:49,603 --> 02:08:51,263
I didn't tell him in details...

2605
02:08:51,632 --> 02:08:53,572
how I really felt...

2606
02:08:53,973 --> 02:08:56,202
or what thoughts were going through my mind.

2607
02:08:56,303 --> 02:09:00,473
So I thought time like that was much needed.

2608
02:09:00,773 --> 02:09:03,443
I hoped that it would be tonight.

2609
02:09:03,843 --> 02:09:06,252
Firstly, my heart felt very heavy.

2610
02:09:06,853 --> 02:09:09,683
But I realized that I needed to be honest.

2611
02:09:14,422 --> 02:09:16,922
(Sleep tight tonight.)

2612
02:09:18,122 --> 02:09:21,233
I definitely saw...

2613
02:09:21,462 --> 02:09:23,233
Jae Hyung's good side.

2614
02:09:23,702 --> 02:09:24,962
So I sent it to him.

2615
02:09:25,832 --> 02:09:29,973
But I thought that Jae Hyung could be...

2616
02:09:30,273 --> 02:09:33,313
my fateful love.

2617
02:09:33,872 --> 02:09:37,582
I became more thoughtful.

2618
02:09:37,742 --> 02:09:39,482
The vibe I got...

2619
02:09:39,483 --> 02:09:41,483
wasn't exhaustion and lack of energy.

2620
02:09:41,582 --> 02:09:45,582
That night did fill my head with thoughts.

2621
02:09:47,422 --> 02:09:51,763
(The two of them become pensive.)

2622
02:09:54,632 --> 02:09:58,903
(Ju Yeon didn't receive any messages.)

2623
02:09:59,403 --> 02:10:02,273
(Ji Won and Ju Yeon chose your sibling.)

2624
02:10:02,672 --> 02:10:05,103
What should I do? My heart aches.

2625
02:10:05,903 --> 02:10:09,912
(No one chose your sibling.)

2626
02:10:14,282 --> 02:10:17,252
(The flat peaches were tasty.)

2627
02:10:18,882 --> 02:10:20,193
- What? - Yong Woo?

2628
02:10:21,492 --> 02:10:22,593
- It's Yong Woo. - It's Yong Woo.

2629
02:10:23,492 --> 02:10:26,433
(The flat peaches were tasty.)

2630
02:10:30,002 --> 02:10:31,832
For me, Cho A gave me...

2631
02:10:32,162 --> 02:10:34,002
my favourite fruit...

2632
02:10:34,372 --> 02:10:35,733
and a magnet.

2633
02:10:36,072 --> 02:10:37,171
In a sense,

2634
02:10:37,172 --> 02:10:39,773
it was the first present I received upon coming here.

2635
02:10:40,113 --> 02:10:41,412
I thought it was right...

2636
02:10:41,773 --> 02:10:44,381
to thank her for our time together...

2637
02:10:44,382 --> 02:10:46,483
and her consideration.

2638
02:10:46,952 --> 02:10:48,653
When I received the message,

2639
02:10:49,113 --> 02:10:52,582
I couldn't accept it as it was.

2640
02:10:52,922 --> 02:10:54,393
There was a bit of suspicion.

2641
02:10:54,792 --> 02:10:56,862
- Seriously. She can't accept it... - It's understandable.

2642
02:10:56,863 --> 02:10:58,422
as it is in her current state.

2643
02:10:58,523 --> 02:11:01,492
I know. He is confusing her further.

2644
02:11:02,433 --> 02:11:05,603
I wanted to know...

2645
02:11:05,933 --> 02:11:09,201
if he sent the message to win me over...

2646
02:11:09,202 --> 02:11:12,002
or if he was simply being very gentle and polite.

2647
02:11:12,103 --> 02:11:14,513
Yong Woo's message...

2648
02:11:14,912 --> 02:11:18,643
didn't exactly make me feel relieved.

2649
02:11:30,792 --> 02:11:35,733
(Yong Woo chose your sibling.)

2650
02:11:36,263 --> 02:11:37,263
Is he playing games?

2651
02:11:37,962 --> 02:11:38,962
See?

2652
02:11:39,132 --> 02:11:41,631
See? It looks like he is playing games.

2653
02:11:41,632 --> 02:11:43,001
- My goodness. - He became annoyed.

2654
02:11:43,002 --> 02:11:44,741
- Yes. He looked cool just now. - It's understandable.

2655
02:11:44,742 --> 02:11:45,903
- "Is he playing games?" - She is his sister.

2656
02:11:46,273 --> 02:11:47,273
Is he playing games?

2657
02:11:48,242 --> 02:11:52,613
I thought, "He doesn't seem to be so nice."

2658
02:11:53,252 --> 02:11:55,682
He sent a message to someone else the day before.

2659
02:11:55,683 --> 02:11:57,622
I felt like he was messaging Cho A again...

2660
02:11:57,853 --> 02:12:01,353
since he messaged someone else and had his attempts failed.

2661
02:12:01,523 --> 02:12:02,593
He must be confused.

2662
02:12:02,693 --> 02:12:04,162
Yong Woo made it more confusing.

2663
02:12:04,263 --> 02:12:05,522
- "What's up with him?" - Seriously.

2664
02:12:05,523 --> 02:12:09,363
He should have just messaged, "It was nice to talk to you today."

2665
02:12:09,702 --> 02:12:11,362
"Let's stay on good terms."

2666
02:12:11,363 --> 02:12:13,501
"This message is a sign of my gratitude."

2667
02:12:13,502 --> 02:12:15,202
That's right. He could have done that.

2668
02:12:18,973 --> 02:12:22,072
(The egg fried rice was very tasty. Thank you.)

2669
02:12:22,372 --> 02:12:23,813
I sent it to Yun Jae.

2670
02:12:24,782 --> 02:12:28,411
Until now, I didn't have any desire...

2671
02:12:28,412 --> 02:12:31,153
to get to know other people.

2672
02:12:31,353 --> 02:12:33,553
But I began to see those around me.

2673
02:12:33,893 --> 02:12:35,452
Because of what happened the day before,

2674
02:12:35,792 --> 02:12:37,922
I couldn't eat anything.

2675
02:12:39,223 --> 02:12:40,392
Would you like more?

2676
02:12:40,393 --> 02:12:41,461
- No, it's okay. - The end.

2677
02:12:41,462 --> 02:12:42,562
(She was thankful for Yun Jae's kindness.)

2678
02:12:42,563 --> 02:12:45,502
It's tasty. I am eating thanks to you.

2679
02:12:46,233 --> 02:12:48,272
He made me egg fried rice.

2680
02:12:48,273 --> 02:12:49,772
"It was very tasty."

2681
02:12:49,773 --> 02:12:51,872
"Thank you." I messaged him to deliver my gratitude.

2682
02:12:52,702 --> 02:12:55,143
I only made that menu for Cho A,

2683
02:12:55,613 --> 02:12:56,613
so I knew who sent the message.

2684
02:12:56,782 --> 02:12:58,443
It was unexpected.

2685
02:12:58,643 --> 02:13:00,312
If she wasn't eating much,

2686
02:13:00,313 --> 02:13:02,452
I made her food.

2687
02:13:02,782 --> 02:13:04,752
I guess Cho A was thankful.

2688
02:13:04,853 --> 02:13:07,952
I was continuing to become closer to her.

2689
02:13:12,662 --> 02:13:15,233
(All messages have been sent.)

2690
02:13:19,933 --> 02:13:22,032
I knew that it would happen,

2691
02:13:22,903 --> 02:13:24,403
so I was calm.

2692
02:13:25,672 --> 02:13:26,843
But it hurt.

2693
02:13:28,042 --> 02:13:29,212
I was calm, but hurt.

2694
02:13:31,843 --> 02:13:36,053
(No one chose your sibling.)

2695
02:13:41,223 --> 02:13:44,961
"No one chose your sibling."

2696
02:13:44,962 --> 02:13:46,063
It was my first time to receive that message.

2697
02:13:46,332 --> 02:13:48,662
"So this is the message you receive when it happens."

2698
02:13:49,233 --> 02:13:50,362
I was worried.

2699
02:13:50,363 --> 02:13:52,902
It was the first time...

2700
02:13:52,903 --> 02:13:55,172
Yong Woo didn't receive a single message.

2701
02:13:55,733 --> 02:14:00,313
But it's the outcome of his own decision.

2702
02:14:02,542 --> 02:14:03,643
He must accept it.

2703
02:14:21,332 --> 02:14:24,532
(Everyone's feelings have been sent.)

2704
02:14:27,872 --> 02:14:29,233
- I will get the door. - Okay.

2705
02:14:30,603 --> 02:14:31,902
What could it be?

2706
02:14:31,903 --> 02:14:34,113
- What could it be? - What could it be?

2707
02:14:43,282 --> 02:14:44,282
Here.

2708
02:14:44,422 --> 02:14:46,023
- Hurry up and open it. - Okay.

2709
02:14:48,393 --> 02:14:51,223
"It's two days before the final date."

2710
02:14:52,962 --> 02:14:55,532
"The last date is the secret date."

2711
02:14:55,893 --> 02:14:58,402
"You can choose up to two people..."

2712
02:14:58,403 --> 02:15:00,631
"you want to meet secretly tomorrow."

2713
02:15:00,632 --> 02:15:01,632
The last date.

2714
02:15:01,633 --> 02:15:04,372
"The dates will be completely secret."

2715
02:15:04,473 --> 02:15:06,871
"You can't reveal or ask..."

2716
02:15:06,872 --> 02:15:08,372
"about the dates."

2717
02:15:09,343 --> 02:15:12,952
This is driving me crazy. Up to two people?

2718
02:15:13,553 --> 02:15:15,412
- It's up to 2 people. - Up to 2 people.

2719
02:15:16,212 --> 02:15:18,053
It was very shocking.

2720
02:15:18,153 --> 02:15:20,052
"Do what you want without any regrets."

2721
02:15:20,053 --> 02:15:21,393
That was what it felt like.

2722
02:15:21,492 --> 02:15:22,921
I thought...

2723
02:15:22,922 --> 02:15:25,363
it was a good opportunity to meet people and talk.

2724
02:15:25,693 --> 02:15:26,962
I wasn't torn.

2725
02:15:27,863 --> 02:15:29,392
- The last date. - The last date.

2726
02:15:29,393 --> 02:15:30,733
Is this the last date?

2727
02:15:30,933 --> 02:15:32,702
Does only one date remain?

2728
02:15:32,803 --> 02:15:34,331
Time passed so quickly.

2729
02:15:34,332 --> 02:15:36,473
People might have chosen each other.

2730
02:15:36,643 --> 02:15:40,072
There might be dates people want to avoid.

2731
02:15:40,542 --> 02:15:42,142
It will be really hard.

2732
02:15:42,143 --> 02:15:44,412
I will need to steel my heart.

2733
02:15:45,643 --> 02:15:46,712
Jung Sub.

2734
02:15:47,882 --> 02:15:49,622
I chose Se Seung.

2735
02:15:49,983 --> 02:15:52,882
We were getting closer to the final decision,

2736
02:15:52,992 --> 02:15:54,593
so I wanted to know what she was thinking.

2737
02:15:54,693 --> 02:15:56,593
The final decision isn't the end.

2738
02:15:56,893 --> 02:15:59,092
I wanted to know if he had any worries about...

2739
02:15:59,093 --> 02:16:00,662
what would come after the final decision.

2740
02:16:01,462 --> 02:16:02,532
I chose Yun Ha.

2741
02:16:02,863 --> 02:16:04,603
I just picked one person.

2742
02:16:11,303 --> 02:16:14,143
As soon I heard the rules, I thought of two people.

2743
02:16:18,042 --> 02:16:20,811
Spending time with that person...

2744
02:16:20,812 --> 02:16:23,252
would be therapeutic.

2745
02:16:23,422 --> 02:16:25,852
Except for the first date he had in Singapore,

2746
02:16:25,853 --> 02:16:27,392
he continued to spend time with Ji Won.

2747
02:16:27,693 --> 02:16:29,252
So I wanted him to have the last date with me.

2748
02:16:29,353 --> 02:16:32,222
I wanted to talk to Ji Won one last time.

2749
02:16:32,523 --> 02:16:36,933
There was something I really wanted to ask.

2750
02:16:41,402 --> 02:16:43,773
I think I was the most torn.

2751
02:16:44,203 --> 02:16:46,072
"What kind of a person should I meet?"

2752
02:16:46,373 --> 02:16:47,972
"What kind of a person do I need?"

2753
02:16:54,383 --> 02:16:58,283
(The secret date application ends.)

2754
02:17:05,722 --> 02:17:09,932
(Including a number of mutual selection,)

2755
02:17:09,933 --> 02:17:14,133
(a total of 9 secret dates have been planned.)

2756
02:17:15,773 --> 02:17:18,202
- It's interesting. - It's interesting.

2757
02:17:18,203 --> 02:17:21,013
You can't ask me even if you are curious, okay?

2758
02:17:21,412 --> 02:17:22,542
We can't reveal any information.

2759
02:17:22,543 --> 02:17:23,642
It's too bad.

2760
02:17:24,713 --> 02:17:25,713
(Glancing over)

2761
02:17:25,714 --> 02:17:26,953
I am so curious.

2762
02:17:28,982 --> 02:17:30,383
Someone should save the golden child.

2763
02:17:32,052 --> 02:17:33,092
The golden child...

2764
02:17:33,093 --> 02:17:34,321
- should eat ramyeon. - Right now,

2765
02:17:34,322 --> 02:17:36,463
the golden child is at his limit.

2766
02:17:40,293 --> 02:17:42,062
Since when was he like this?

2767
02:17:42,533 --> 02:17:44,363
He has been like that for a long while.

2768
02:17:44,463 --> 02:17:45,963
Doctor, since when was he like this?

2769
02:17:48,302 --> 02:17:50,672
I haven't seen him that lethargic in a long while.

2770
02:17:51,943 --> 02:17:52,972
Are you okay?

2771
02:17:53,713 --> 02:17:55,343
- Are you okay? - No.

2772
02:17:56,443 --> 02:17:58,982
It's too...

2773
02:18:03,322 --> 02:18:04,353
I want to sleep.

2774
02:18:11,492 --> 02:18:13,933
You must be really exhausted to be sprawled out like this.

2775
02:18:15,763 --> 02:18:16,763
Are you okay?

2776
02:18:18,062 --> 02:18:19,203
Are you hungry as well?

2777
02:18:19,302 --> 02:18:22,202
My energy is low.

2778
02:18:22,203 --> 02:18:23,472
- Is your energy low? - Pasta.

2779
02:18:23,773 --> 02:18:25,273
Ju Yeon, are you going to eat pasta?

2780
02:18:25,672 --> 02:18:27,312
It was my ambitious work.

2781
02:18:27,742 --> 02:18:28,943
It's okay. You can blanch it in the water.

2782
02:18:30,183 --> 02:18:31,783
(Sighing)

2783
02:18:32,013 --> 02:18:34,412
We can't even talk today.

2784
02:18:34,513 --> 02:18:36,523
- What? - We can't even talk.

2785
02:18:37,652 --> 02:18:40,551
After she came back from the second date with Jae Hyung,

2786
02:18:40,552 --> 02:18:41,922
I studied Ji Won's face.

2787
02:18:42,252 --> 02:18:44,123
She wasn't in the right condition.

2788
02:18:44,623 --> 02:18:46,391
Are you going to eat it? It's tasty.

2789
02:18:46,392 --> 02:18:47,433
(Yun Jae and Ji Won head over to the terrace.)

2790
02:18:49,732 --> 02:18:51,533
What did you guys do today?

2791
02:18:51,963 --> 02:18:53,932
We had dinner and rode the Ferris wheel.

2792
02:18:53,933 --> 02:18:54,933
Really?

2793
02:18:56,002 --> 02:18:57,902
- I need soju. - Why?

2794
02:18:58,672 --> 02:19:01,273
Nothing bad happened.

2795
02:19:01,972 --> 02:19:04,783
But I felt like I was making the same decision...

2796
02:19:05,683 --> 02:19:08,811
as I did when I was outside...

2797
02:19:08,812 --> 02:19:10,123
today.

2798
02:19:10,222 --> 02:19:11,252
When you were outside?

2799
02:19:11,353 --> 02:19:13,793
On this show, I wanted to meet someone...

2800
02:19:13,892 --> 02:19:15,422
I could depend on...

2801
02:19:15,523 --> 02:19:18,192
and share my feelings...

2802
02:19:18,193 --> 02:19:19,222
on a deeper level.

2803
02:19:19,623 --> 02:19:21,962
Am I going in the same direction...

2804
02:19:21,963 --> 02:19:24,962
because there isn't anyone like that?

2805
02:19:24,963 --> 02:19:28,971
Am I making such a decision because I am following...

2806
02:19:28,972 --> 02:19:32,172
my natural tendencies without getting to really know...

2807
02:19:32,273 --> 02:19:34,072
other people?

2808
02:19:34,273 --> 02:19:36,543
Perhaps you are thinking too deeply.

2809
02:19:36,843 --> 02:19:37,912
Seriously.

2810
02:19:38,082 --> 02:19:39,082
Who sent me the messages?

2811
02:19:39,812 --> 02:19:41,982
Yun Ha and Cho A.

2812
02:19:42,412 --> 02:19:43,522
Why did Cho A message me?

2813
02:19:43,523 --> 02:19:45,651
- It can't be something serious. - Right.

2814
02:19:45,652 --> 02:19:48,492
Since she had a falling out with Yong Woo...

2815
02:19:48,593 --> 02:19:50,262
- What happened with Yong Woo? - I don't know the details.

2816
02:19:50,263 --> 02:19:52,661
- Did something happen yesterday? - No. I don't know.

2817
02:19:52,662 --> 02:19:53,693
I came back late.

2818
02:19:53,992 --> 02:19:56,362
Yong Woo talked about it in our room.

2819
02:19:56,363 --> 02:19:57,363
After focusing on one person,

2820
02:19:57,364 --> 02:19:58,933
he was struggling.

2821
02:19:59,133 --> 02:20:01,001
I am sure it's something between the two of them.

2822
02:20:01,002 --> 02:20:02,273
- What could it be? - I don't know.

2823
02:20:04,873 --> 02:20:06,443
- Can we talk? - Sure.

2824
02:20:11,943 --> 02:20:14,713
I needed to take a break.

2825
02:20:15,283 --> 02:20:17,582
- That was why I didn't message you. - Right.

2826
02:20:17,683 --> 02:20:19,482
- I understood it as such. - Really?

2827
02:20:19,582 --> 02:20:21,252
Yes, of course.

2828
02:20:21,353 --> 02:20:23,822
I thought it was very natural.

2829
02:20:24,593 --> 02:20:26,492
I wanted to tell you that.

2830
02:20:27,062 --> 02:20:29,863
I thought it was very natural not to receive a message from you.

2831
02:20:30,332 --> 02:20:32,933
I sent you a message because the fruits were so tasty.

2832
02:20:34,332 --> 02:20:35,402
Where did you buy them?

2833
02:20:36,472 --> 02:20:38,001
One peach was remaining.

2834
02:20:38,002 --> 02:20:39,742
- I knew someone hadn't eaten it, - Right.

2835
02:20:39,843 --> 02:20:41,013
but I just ate it.

2836
02:20:41,242 --> 02:20:43,612
The first pack I bought was for you.

2837
02:20:43,613 --> 02:20:45,241
- I ate most of them. - Really?

2838
02:20:45,242 --> 02:20:48,882
The second pack was for other people, right?

2839
02:20:48,883 --> 02:20:50,123
But I ate one more.

2840
02:20:50,222 --> 02:20:51,353
(I see.)

2841
02:20:52,152 --> 02:20:55,652
I knew someone else would take it, so I ate it.

2842
02:20:56,123 --> 02:20:59,062
Was that the only meaning behind the message?

2843
02:20:59,363 --> 02:21:00,433
Well...

2844
02:21:02,992 --> 02:21:05,002
- I don't know. - You don't know.

2845
02:21:08,672 --> 02:21:10,572
(Well...)

2846
02:21:11,443 --> 02:21:14,713
You know that we shouldn't confuse each other at this point, right?

2847
02:21:14,912 --> 02:21:15,912
Of course.

2848
02:21:19,812 --> 02:21:23,052
I wanted to check the meaning behind the message.

2849
02:21:23,152 --> 02:21:26,322
I wanted to know if the message was what it was...

2850
02:21:26,652 --> 02:21:30,093
or if there was a deeper meaning.

2851
02:21:30,222 --> 02:21:33,532
The message confused me once more.

2852
02:21:33,533 --> 02:21:35,093
(My goodness)

2853
02:21:35,293 --> 02:21:37,231
It's true. She has a point.

2854
02:21:37,232 --> 02:21:38,262
Not much time remains.

2855
02:21:38,263 --> 02:21:39,972
That's right. This is an important time.

2856
02:21:40,572 --> 02:21:43,703
You know that we shouldn't confuse each other at this point, right?

2857
02:21:43,902 --> 02:21:44,902
Of course.

2858
02:21:46,443 --> 02:21:47,912
The peaches were very tasty.

2859
02:21:51,082 --> 02:21:52,843
You just liked the peaches.

2860
02:21:54,982 --> 02:21:56,252
It's shaped like a peach.

2861
02:21:58,822 --> 02:22:03,252
Okay. In any case, I wanted to tell you that.

2862
02:22:09,832 --> 02:22:11,732
Ji Won, what are you going to do?

2863
02:22:11,933 --> 02:22:13,232
Are you going to eat or not?

2864
02:22:13,332 --> 02:22:16,033
Are you going to eat? Wouldn't it be better to sleep?

2865
02:22:16,603 --> 02:22:19,072
Why do I feel cold? Do I feel unwell?

2866
02:22:20,843 --> 02:22:23,113
- It's a lot. - Just go with it.

2867
02:22:23,683 --> 02:22:25,582
- Three packets. - Three packets?

2868
02:22:26,142 --> 02:22:27,213
Let's cook three packets.

2869
02:22:30,283 --> 02:22:32,581
Jae Hyung was very exhausted...

2870
02:22:32,582 --> 02:22:34,422
after having a full-day date with Ji Won.

2871
02:22:34,523 --> 02:22:36,152
The atmosphere was very bad.

2872
02:22:36,252 --> 02:22:39,992
I wanted to talk to him when the atmosphere was better.

2873
02:22:40,933 --> 02:22:42,463
I am dying.

2874
02:22:43,062 --> 02:22:45,802
Why did my energy suddenly disappear?

2875
02:22:47,232 --> 02:22:50,142
I felt fine until the Ferris wheel.

2876
02:22:50,572 --> 02:22:51,572
The Ferris wheel?

2877
02:22:53,773 --> 02:22:57,142
I just saw a chunk of doenjang.

2878
02:22:57,312 --> 02:22:59,343
It will be fine once it boils, okay?

2879
02:22:59,482 --> 02:23:00,552
Is that so?

2880
02:23:03,752 --> 02:23:04,752
What was that just now?

2881
02:23:04,753 --> 02:23:06,023
They are bickering.

2882
02:23:06,623 --> 02:23:08,391
I think Ji Won is the type...

2883
02:23:08,392 --> 02:23:10,892
to get hurt by those small things.

2884
02:23:10,992 --> 02:23:13,061
- Jae Hyung speaks brusquely. - Those comments...

2885
02:23:13,062 --> 02:23:14,062
- Right. - It seems that way.

2886
02:23:14,193 --> 02:23:16,232
It will be fine once it boils, okay?

2887
02:23:16,332 --> 02:23:17,463
Is that so?

2888
02:23:20,203 --> 02:23:21,232
Thank you for the food.

2889
02:23:21,773 --> 02:23:24,472
- The pasta I made... - The pasta I made...

2890
02:23:25,242 --> 02:23:26,602
You are stealing food.

2891
02:23:26,603 --> 02:23:27,773
I stole so much food.

2892
02:23:28,273 --> 02:23:30,183
(Glancing over)

2893
02:23:32,343 --> 02:23:34,812
Do you have any regrets after joining the show?

2894
02:23:35,183 --> 02:23:37,151
- It could be disappointment. - This is sudden.

2895
02:23:37,152 --> 02:23:38,222
"I should have done this."

2896
02:23:38,322 --> 02:23:40,523
Regret? I shouldn't have played badminton.

2897
02:23:41,353 --> 02:23:42,721
- Badminton? Right. - That was sudden.

2898
02:23:42,722 --> 02:23:44,221
- It's a conversation... - Right.

2899
02:23:44,222 --> 02:23:46,593
between a total feeler and a total thinker.

2900
02:23:47,763 --> 02:23:49,033
- I... - I am not a total thinker.

2901
02:23:49,463 --> 02:23:51,133
You are a total thinker.

2902
02:23:51,662 --> 02:23:52,662
After joining the show...

2903
02:23:53,203 --> 02:23:54,603
Are you a thinker or a feeler?

2904
02:23:54,832 --> 02:23:55,873
- Me? - A feeler.

2905
02:23:56,232 --> 02:23:57,242
Both.

2906
02:23:57,972 --> 02:23:58,972
It's half and half.

2907
02:23:59,773 --> 02:24:01,843
- What are you, Ji Won? - A feeler.

2908
02:24:01,943 --> 02:24:02,943
Are you a feeler?

2909
02:24:04,742 --> 02:24:05,912
You seem like a thinker.

2910
02:24:06,713 --> 02:24:08,353
- Right? - I do seem that way.

2911
02:24:09,453 --> 02:24:10,853
I try to be a thinker.

2912
02:24:10,953 --> 02:24:13,953
(Glancing over)

2913
02:24:15,052 --> 02:24:16,123
Yun Ha, what are you doing?

2914
02:24:16,552 --> 02:24:17,822
- What? - What are you doing?

2915
02:24:18,263 --> 02:24:19,793
- Can I go in? - Yes.

2916
02:24:20,162 --> 02:24:21,363
You wanted to drink.

2917
02:24:21,863 --> 02:24:23,262
I am going to take a quick nap.

2918
02:24:23,263 --> 02:24:24,263
- A quick nap? - Yes.

2919
02:24:24,662 --> 02:24:25,732
I didn't see you downstairs.

2920
02:24:25,832 --> 02:24:27,773
Everyone is eating except for you.

2921
02:24:27,873 --> 02:24:31,001
There is tension between people...

2922
02:24:31,002 --> 02:24:33,873
that can't be described with words.

2923
02:24:33,972 --> 02:24:36,472
Because of that tension,

2924
02:24:36,572 --> 02:24:40,013
I was drawn to Yun Jae...

2925
02:24:40,353 --> 02:24:41,783
who gave me comfort.

2926
02:24:49,793 --> 02:24:51,623
(Glancing over)

2927
02:24:52,763 --> 02:24:54,062
You feel drowsy after eating.

2928
02:24:57,302 --> 02:24:58,302
All right.

2929
02:24:59,002 --> 02:25:01,502
I had already sent Jae Hyung a message...

2930
02:25:01,802 --> 02:25:02,802
and asked him for a conversation.

2931
02:25:03,172 --> 02:25:06,402
But Jae Hyung seemed to be avoiding me.

2932
02:25:06,642 --> 02:25:07,873
After reading the room,

2933
02:25:08,412 --> 02:25:10,112
I asked him if we could talk.

2934
02:25:10,113 --> 02:25:11,542
- Jae Hyung. - Yes?

2935
02:25:11,543 --> 02:25:12,613
- Can we talk? - Okay.

2936
02:25:16,283 --> 02:25:17,482
This place is nice.

2937
02:25:18,523 --> 02:25:21,722
I think they should close down that area.

2938
02:25:21,992 --> 02:25:22,992
The air is bad.

2939
02:25:22,993 --> 02:25:25,062
- That's right. That place... - That place makes things deep.

2940
02:25:25,363 --> 02:25:26,693
My goodness.

2941
02:25:27,433 --> 02:25:28,693
You must be very tired?

2942
02:25:29,062 --> 02:25:31,703
What? Well, it's okay.

2943
02:25:32,863 --> 02:25:35,072
I wanted to have a conversation with you,

2944
02:25:35,773 --> 02:25:37,672
so I looked for the right timing.

2945
02:25:42,443 --> 02:25:45,642
We had a date on our first day in Singapore.

2946
02:25:46,242 --> 02:25:48,383
Back then, I remember...

2947
02:25:48,713 --> 02:25:50,853
that you were very confused.

2948
02:25:51,582 --> 02:25:53,152
How are things now?

2949
02:25:54,023 --> 02:25:58,492
To be honest, I was pretty lost.

2950
02:25:59,863 --> 02:26:03,863
But I am beginning to make sense of things.

2951
02:26:05,863 --> 02:26:08,802
Back in Gangwon Province,

2952
02:26:09,633 --> 02:26:13,072
we shared some mutual interests.

2953
02:26:14,013 --> 02:26:16,912
But from then and now,

2954
02:26:17,713 --> 02:26:19,113
the feelings weren't mutual.

2955
02:26:21,213 --> 02:26:22,852
I am very curious...

2956
02:26:22,853 --> 02:26:26,422
about what changed things.

2957
02:26:28,023 --> 02:26:31,822
I wouldn't say that there was a specific moment.

2958
02:26:32,593 --> 02:26:34,891
To be honest,

2959
02:26:34,892 --> 02:26:38,502
there wasn't anyone I wanted to open up to in the beginning.

2960
02:26:39,562 --> 02:26:41,572
But I went on dates.

2961
02:26:42,002 --> 02:26:43,772
When I had a date with Yun Ha,

2962
02:26:43,773 --> 02:26:46,343
I messaged Yun Ha.

2963
02:26:46,972 --> 02:26:49,513
When I had a date with you, I messaged you.

2964
02:26:49,843 --> 02:26:52,182
I think the messages carry...

2965
02:26:52,183 --> 02:26:54,283
a lot of weight.

2966
02:26:54,513 --> 02:26:56,912
I think it can give the recipient...

2967
02:26:57,322 --> 02:27:00,623
false hope or a misunderstanding.

2968
02:27:01,193 --> 02:27:03,922
So when we could decide not to message anyone,

2969
02:27:04,023 --> 02:27:05,422
I chose that option.

2970
02:27:06,162 --> 02:27:10,633
My feelings were like that from the start.

2971
02:27:11,232 --> 02:27:15,072
Now, I realized that I needed to be firmer...

2972
02:27:15,402 --> 02:27:16,732
with my stance.

2973
02:27:19,603 --> 02:27:22,213
He told her everything with honesty.

2974
02:27:22,312 --> 02:27:23,682
It's nice to tell her that.

2975
02:27:23,683 --> 02:27:24,741
That's right. He is precise.

2976
02:27:24,742 --> 02:27:25,911
It's very nice to tell her that.

2977
02:27:25,912 --> 02:27:27,712
Yong Woo and Jae Hyung...

2978
02:27:27,713 --> 02:27:30,453
are the complete opposites in the way they talk.

2979
02:27:30,552 --> 02:27:34,322
I think Jae Hyung's honesty...

2980
02:27:34,492 --> 02:27:35,991
is more relieving.

2981
02:27:35,992 --> 02:27:38,561
- It only hurts once. - That's right.

2982
02:27:38,562 --> 02:27:41,132
- It's always like that. - Would you take one strong punch...

2983
02:27:41,133 --> 02:27:42,662
or 100 weak punches?

2984
02:27:43,293 --> 02:27:45,102
- One strong punch. - That's right.

2985
02:27:45,103 --> 02:27:46,363
One strong punch is better.

2986
02:27:46,562 --> 02:27:49,902
Now, I realized that I needed to be firmer...

2987
02:27:50,203 --> 02:27:51,472
with my stance.

2988
02:27:53,002 --> 02:27:54,543
(I see.)

2989
02:28:05,383 --> 02:28:06,552
This is what it sounds like.

2990
02:28:06,883 --> 02:28:09,422
Because you had to make a choice,

2991
02:28:09,752 --> 02:28:13,093
you chose me when you went on a date with me.

2992
02:28:16,933 --> 02:28:19,732
To be honest, the messages put a lot of pressure...

2993
02:28:20,373 --> 02:28:22,002
on me.

2994
02:28:26,172 --> 02:28:27,213
That was what it felt like.

2995
02:28:27,742 --> 02:28:30,742
Despite that, I had to make a choice.

2996
02:28:30,982 --> 02:28:31,982
Right.

2997
02:28:31,983 --> 02:28:33,981
That was why I messaged you.

2998
02:28:33,982 --> 02:28:34,982
Okay.

2999
02:28:37,853 --> 02:28:38,883
I see.

3000
02:28:42,093 --> 02:28:44,821
"It couldn't be you because of this and that."

3001
02:28:44,822 --> 02:28:47,392
It's nothing like that. It's just that...

3002
02:28:48,232 --> 02:28:51,732
I continued to think about whether or not...

3003
02:28:52,103 --> 02:28:55,732
I saw you as a woman.

3004
02:28:56,172 --> 02:28:59,741
At one point, I made an effort to see you that way...

3005
02:28:59,742 --> 02:29:02,112
because I wanted to make a choice...

3006
02:29:02,113 --> 02:29:04,113
- without pondering so much. - Okay.

3007
02:29:05,683 --> 02:29:09,752
(Jae Hyung wasn't certain about his feelings for Ju Yeon.)

3008
02:29:10,623 --> 02:29:13,852
If you could choose your next date, who would it be?

3009
02:29:13,853 --> 02:29:15,293
I don't know.

3010
02:29:15,953 --> 02:29:17,922
- You aren't sure about anyone. - No.

3011
02:29:19,922 --> 02:29:24,433
Since I kept wondering after some time...

3012
02:29:24,963 --> 02:29:28,502
It let me know that I didn't see you that way.

3013
02:29:29,273 --> 02:29:31,402
It made me think, "I need to be firm."

3014
02:29:32,343 --> 02:29:33,642
(I see.)

3015
02:29:38,343 --> 02:29:39,613
It was shocking.

3016
02:29:40,383 --> 02:29:41,383
Yes.

3017
02:29:41,384 --> 02:29:43,182
I thought there was a time...

3018
02:29:43,183 --> 02:29:46,023
he was torn between me and Ji Won.

3019
02:29:47,353 --> 02:29:48,752
But there was never that moment.

3020
02:29:49,093 --> 02:29:51,123
"I never saw you as a woman."

3021
02:29:51,693 --> 02:29:54,362
"It wasn't you."

3022
02:29:54,363 --> 02:29:57,863
His every word told me that.

3023
02:29:58,302 --> 02:30:00,302
It was a bit shocking.

3024
02:30:03,603 --> 02:30:04,842
- Right now... - Are you exhausted?

3025
02:30:04,843 --> 02:30:05,843
Yes, I am exhausted.

3026
02:30:06,502 --> 02:30:08,911
- All of us are exhausted. - Why is everyone exhausted today?

3027
02:30:08,912 --> 02:30:10,782
- Ji Won, what did you do today? - Me?

3028
02:30:10,783 --> 02:30:11,981
- What did you do today? - I had dinner...

3029
02:30:11,982 --> 02:30:13,113
and rode the Ferris wheel.

3030
02:30:13,213 --> 02:30:15,012
- That one? - I wondered who would ride it.

3031
02:30:15,013 --> 02:30:16,151
Was it fun?

3032
02:30:16,152 --> 02:30:17,222
It was very slow.

3033
02:30:17,552 --> 02:30:18,953
- It was very slow. - Okay.

3034
02:30:18,982 --> 02:30:21,891
I am sorry, but impatience runs in the family.

3035
02:30:21,892 --> 02:30:23,692
- Yes. - I can see that.

3036
02:30:23,693 --> 02:30:26,463
It was so slow that we went, "Did it stop?"

3037
02:30:26,963 --> 02:30:28,462
We asked that about ten times.

3038
02:30:28,463 --> 02:30:29,532
- The Ferris wheel... - That explains...

3039
02:30:29,533 --> 02:30:31,832
- why Jae Hyung is so tired. - Yes.

3040
02:30:32,263 --> 02:30:34,603
That's right. Both of us were like that.

3041
02:30:35,172 --> 02:30:37,872
The two of you looked especially tired today.

3042
02:30:37,873 --> 02:30:39,971
That's right. Very tired.

3043
02:30:39,972 --> 02:30:42,343
- Why... - So the Ferris wheel stopped.

3044
02:30:43,013 --> 02:30:45,242
- Really? - It stopped.

3045
02:30:45,742 --> 02:30:47,582
We kept being like, "Did it stop?"

3046
02:30:48,683 --> 02:30:49,713
All right.

3047
02:30:49,912 --> 02:30:51,452
Tomorrow...

3048
02:30:51,453 --> 02:30:52,481
I just received it.

3049
02:30:52,482 --> 02:30:54,052
We won't see each other all day long.

3050
02:30:55,023 --> 02:30:56,093
- What? - What?

3051
02:30:56,922 --> 02:30:58,863
Since we are having secret dates tomorrow,

3052
02:30:59,263 --> 02:31:02,232
things will probably proceed like the Siblings' Room.

3053
02:31:03,933 --> 02:31:05,132
Are you angry?

3054
02:31:05,133 --> 02:31:06,162
No.

3055
02:31:06,933 --> 02:31:08,433
I want you to be happy.

3056
02:31:09,133 --> 02:31:10,172
All right.

3057
02:31:11,142 --> 02:31:12,302
There is no beer.

3058
02:31:13,802 --> 02:31:16,013
(She picks up soju instead.)

3059
02:31:19,443 --> 02:31:20,481
- Hey. - Hello.

3060
02:31:20,482 --> 02:31:22,212
- Come here. Come on in. - Hey.

3061
02:31:22,213 --> 02:31:23,482
- Come on in. - Hey.

3062
02:31:24,082 --> 02:31:25,352
- What? - What? You brought soju.

3063
02:31:25,353 --> 02:31:26,581
- A bottle of soju. - There was no beer.

3064
02:31:26,582 --> 02:31:28,292
What is going on?

3065
02:31:28,293 --> 02:31:30,392
- Sit down. - Ju Yeon has been...

3066
02:31:30,863 --> 02:31:33,193
When I entered the room,

3067
02:31:33,293 --> 02:31:35,232
Jae Hyung was already sitting next to Ji Won.

3068
02:31:36,793 --> 02:31:38,933
"Did he want a peace of mind?"

3069
02:31:40,062 --> 02:31:41,572
I had that thought.

3070
02:31:42,572 --> 02:31:45,373
For the first time, I didn't want to see his face.

3071
02:31:47,273 --> 02:31:49,312
- I think Jae Hyung needs sleep. - Yes.

3072
02:31:49,543 --> 02:31:50,612
Are you okay?

3073
02:31:50,613 --> 02:31:52,342
- Jae Hyung needs sleep. - Get some sleep.

3074
02:31:52,343 --> 02:31:53,613
He must be very exhausted.

3075
02:31:53,953 --> 02:31:55,412
- You look very tired. - Yes.

3076
02:31:55,883 --> 02:31:56,952
Until 11pm...

3077
02:31:56,953 --> 02:31:59,182
- It's tasty. - Is it frozen?

3078
02:31:59,183 --> 02:32:00,722
It's my style.

3079
02:32:03,523 --> 02:32:04,892
Jae Hyung looks exhausted.

3080
02:32:06,492 --> 02:32:07,763
He looks so exhausted.

3081
02:32:08,832 --> 02:32:10,263
Isn't it because you usually go to work?

3082
02:32:12,162 --> 02:32:14,672
I woke up early today.

3083
02:32:17,232 --> 02:32:20,072
I noticed something.

3084
02:32:20,873 --> 02:32:24,582
Are things not going well between Jae Hyung and Ji Won?

3085
02:32:25,613 --> 02:32:26,713
I felt like...

3086
02:32:27,582 --> 02:32:29,552
the atmosphere was strange.

3087
02:32:30,213 --> 02:32:31,282
You did that...

3088
02:32:31,283 --> 02:32:32,522
- at 8am? - Yes.

3089
02:32:32,523 --> 02:32:34,853
When did you do that?

3090
02:32:35,252 --> 02:32:36,551
- What? - When did you run?

3091
02:32:36,552 --> 02:32:38,523
- Back in university. - I will wash up.

3092
02:32:39,023 --> 02:32:40,093
Wash up and come back.

3093
02:32:41,093 --> 02:32:42,433
Where is the remote control?

3094
02:32:42,863 --> 02:32:44,133
- It's here. - It's in the room.

3095
02:32:52,043 --> 02:32:54,013
Here, I don't get sleepy at night.

3096
02:32:54,472 --> 02:32:55,942
I get sleepy in the car.

3097
02:32:55,943 --> 02:32:57,412
- That's right. Seriously. - Seriously.

3098
02:32:57,742 --> 02:32:59,782
At night, I can't sleep...

3099
02:32:59,783 --> 02:33:01,282
- because I am busy thinking. - Yes.

3100
02:33:01,283 --> 02:33:03,953
Does everyone have a worry at night?

3101
02:33:05,082 --> 02:33:06,453
You said that you couldn't sleep last night.

3102
02:33:07,183 --> 02:33:09,952
I felt like I was the only one.

3103
02:33:09,953 --> 02:33:11,022
- What? - What are you talking about?

3104
02:33:11,023 --> 02:33:12,293
I see that everyone has a worry.

3105
02:33:12,623 --> 02:33:14,263
Yong Woo, do you have a worry?

3106
02:33:14,463 --> 02:33:15,831
Me? A worry?

3107
02:33:15,832 --> 02:33:16,962
- Seriously. - To be honest,

3108
02:33:16,963 --> 02:33:19,902
I began to have a worry recently.

3109
02:33:20,703 --> 02:33:22,001
- It was like that. - By recently,

3110
02:33:22,002 --> 02:33:23,373
don't you mean yesterday?

3111
02:33:23,502 --> 02:33:25,603
- Why is it so funny? - It was like that.

3112
02:33:25,972 --> 02:33:28,672
I thought I was the only one with a worry.

3113
02:33:28,943 --> 02:33:30,571
No. Yesterday,

3114
02:33:30,572 --> 02:33:32,282
- everyone had a worry. - Really?

3115
02:33:32,283 --> 02:33:33,942
- That's right. - Yes.

3116
02:33:33,943 --> 02:33:35,013
- I didn't know. - That's right.

3117
02:33:35,353 --> 02:33:36,411
Let's clean up.

3118
02:33:36,412 --> 02:33:37,651
- Let's clean up. - Yes.

3119
02:33:37,652 --> 02:33:39,081
We have tomorrow.

3120
02:33:39,082 --> 02:33:40,221
Let's sleep for tomorrow.

3121
02:33:40,222 --> 02:33:42,193
(Jae Hyung is done preparing to go to bed.)

3122
02:33:44,593 --> 02:33:47,492
(He lingers in front of Ji Won's room.)

3123
02:33:51,332 --> 02:33:52,332
Yes?

3124
02:33:53,133 --> 02:33:54,873
- Shall we talk for ten minutes? - Sure.

3125
02:33:55,933 --> 02:34:00,471
Before going on a secret date, I wanted to talk to her...

3126
02:34:00,472 --> 02:34:03,943
at a comfortable and open place.

3127
02:34:05,183 --> 02:34:06,682
- Why was it so short? - What?

3128
02:34:06,683 --> 02:34:07,982
Why was it so short?

3129
02:34:09,783 --> 02:34:10,953
- Do you mean the message? - Yes.

3130
02:34:12,422 --> 02:34:13,482
I was joking.

3131
02:34:15,193 --> 02:34:16,252
You startled me.

3132
02:34:17,252 --> 02:34:19,522
You were giving it a serious thought, right?

3133
02:34:19,523 --> 02:34:21,093
"Did I send a short message?"

3134
02:34:22,033 --> 02:34:24,562
Mine was the longest.

3135
02:34:26,302 --> 02:34:27,332
Was it like that?

3136
02:34:29,103 --> 02:34:30,703
Yes, it was.

3137
02:34:33,502 --> 02:34:34,812
Were you upset since it was short?

3138
02:34:34,972 --> 02:34:36,273
No, it wasn't like that.

3139
02:34:39,513 --> 02:34:40,513
Ji Won.

3140
02:34:40,752 --> 02:34:42,953
(The owner of the room came to find Ji Won.)

3141
02:34:44,183 --> 02:34:46,552
(He spots the two on the terrace.)

3142
02:34:47,252 --> 02:34:49,052
(He quickly makes a U-turn.)

3143
02:34:49,853 --> 02:34:53,822
I needed to talk to you at a place without all the people.

3144
02:34:55,392 --> 02:34:57,901
I see that it's still hard...

3145
02:34:57,902 --> 02:35:00,033
- for you. - Yes, I worry about it a lot.

3146
02:35:02,832 --> 02:35:06,343
Earlier, I suddenly felt the discrepancy...

3147
02:35:07,203 --> 02:35:10,373
between the dream and reality.

3148
02:35:11,982 --> 02:35:13,742
I wanted to know how you felt.

3149
02:35:13,912 --> 02:35:15,412
When did you feel that?

3150
02:35:17,683 --> 02:35:18,822
In the Gondola.

3151
02:35:19,853 --> 02:35:22,392
"Is this the reality?"

3152
02:35:23,722 --> 02:35:25,963
I kept having that thought.

3153
02:35:26,363 --> 02:35:27,422
It felt...

3154
02:35:30,662 --> 02:35:33,402
a bit complicated.

3155
02:35:35,133 --> 02:35:38,372
I know that it's still hard...

3156
02:35:38,373 --> 02:35:43,042
for you to become absorbed in this situation.

3157
02:35:43,043 --> 02:35:45,843
So I understand you more.

3158
02:35:46,482 --> 02:35:47,713
Back then,

3159
02:35:49,582 --> 02:35:52,981
you couldn't focus much.

3160
02:35:52,982 --> 02:35:54,523
I felt like...

3161
02:35:55,093 --> 02:35:59,693
I didn't have many ways to get to know you.

3162
02:36:00,162 --> 02:36:01,891
Since you were careful,

3163
02:36:01,892 --> 02:36:04,162
you couldn't show me much.

3164
02:36:04,363 --> 02:36:07,103
While we are on this show,

3165
02:36:08,002 --> 02:36:12,742
this is the most I can find out about you.

3166
02:36:13,043 --> 02:36:15,212
I wonder what you would be like...

3167
02:36:15,213 --> 02:36:17,682
outside the show.

3168
02:36:17,683 --> 02:36:20,311
But my imagination is...

3169
02:36:20,312 --> 02:36:22,513
based on what I see here.

3170
02:36:26,222 --> 02:36:28,593
So it is hard.

3171
02:36:29,722 --> 02:36:32,992
I feel like I know who you are, then I become unsure.

3172
02:36:33,463 --> 02:36:34,633
As for you,

3173
02:36:36,633 --> 02:36:42,172
how much weight does the final decision...

3174
02:36:43,832 --> 02:36:44,971
carry?

3175
02:36:44,972 --> 02:36:48,013
How much depth does it carry?

3176
02:36:49,172 --> 02:36:51,713
As for me, the final decision carries much weight.

3177
02:36:52,343 --> 02:36:54,482
"If I join the show..."

3178
02:36:54,582 --> 02:36:57,752
"and end up with someone at the final decision,"

3179
02:36:58,853 --> 02:37:00,183
"I will go ahead..."

3180
02:37:01,093 --> 02:37:04,151
"and marry her." I came here with that thought.

3181
02:37:04,152 --> 02:37:07,193
I am 30 years old.

3182
02:37:07,863 --> 02:37:10,793
I have been in many relationships.

3183
02:37:11,162 --> 02:37:15,002
Until now, I have been in a relationship solely for fun...

3184
02:37:15,273 --> 02:37:19,471
or the joy of the moment.

3185
02:37:19,472 --> 02:37:21,013
Now, I want to find stability.

3186
02:37:21,443 --> 02:37:22,572
I do want to...

3187
02:37:23,513 --> 02:37:26,642
find someone I will spend my future with.

3188
02:37:26,742 --> 02:37:28,552
I know that this isn't a marriage interview.

3189
02:37:28,912 --> 02:37:30,311
But this is a unique situation.

3190
02:37:30,312 --> 02:37:34,751
If I choose someone through this special opportunity,

3191
02:37:34,752 --> 02:37:37,193
my decision would carry that much weight.

3192
02:37:38,162 --> 02:37:39,492
To be honest,

3193
02:37:40,222 --> 02:37:43,633
due to my worries and situation of the reality,

3194
02:37:44,832 --> 02:37:49,072
I don't want to meet someone because I got intrigued...

3195
02:37:50,873 --> 02:37:53,641
by simple curiosity...

3196
02:37:53,642 --> 02:37:56,943
or fluttering of the heart.

3197
02:37:57,412 --> 02:38:00,682
"I really want to know more about this person."

3198
02:38:00,683 --> 02:38:02,783
I need to have that thought.

3199
02:38:03,052 --> 02:38:04,982
But it seems like...

3200
02:38:05,582 --> 02:38:09,293
you will just choose someone you want to know better...

3201
02:38:09,652 --> 02:38:15,793
and close the chapter, which is this show.

3202
02:38:15,963 --> 02:38:17,193
That's right. It will be closed.

3203
02:38:17,433 --> 02:38:20,263
So you might be different from me.

3204
02:38:22,302 --> 02:38:25,142
- Go ahead and get some rest. - Okay.

3205
02:38:25,603 --> 02:38:26,672
All right.

3206
02:38:28,642 --> 02:38:29,742
Let's go.

3207
02:38:31,043 --> 02:38:32,683
Go ahead and sleep.

3208
02:38:33,343 --> 02:38:34,683
- Good night. - Okay.

3209
02:38:36,252 --> 02:38:38,123
- Good night, Yun Jae. - All right.

3210
02:38:38,422 --> 02:38:39,652
- You had a long day. - Yes.

3211
02:38:42,293 --> 02:38:43,623
What did you talk about with Jae Hyung?

3212
02:38:43,853 --> 02:38:45,322
I think Jae Hyung...

3213
02:38:47,693 --> 02:38:50,463
cares a lot about the environment.

3214
02:38:51,263 --> 02:38:52,332
It's understandable.

3215
02:38:53,533 --> 02:38:55,072
But because of that,

3216
02:38:56,033 --> 02:39:00,302
I can't see what he is really like.

3217
02:39:01,843 --> 02:39:03,513
If you can't see it, you should go and see it.

3218
02:39:04,113 --> 02:39:05,113
What?

3219
02:39:06,443 --> 02:39:08,252
You shouldn't go too deep with your thoughts.

3220
02:39:09,412 --> 02:39:10,453
All right.

3221
02:39:11,453 --> 02:39:13,082
Don't go too deep with your thoughts.

3222
02:39:13,453 --> 02:39:15,992
You are the one who goes too deep with your thoughts.

3223
02:39:16,822 --> 02:39:17,892
You are right.

3224
02:39:29,402 --> 02:39:30,773
(You look cool.)

3225
02:39:33,543 --> 02:39:35,772
(I was so anxious.)

3226
02:39:35,773 --> 02:39:37,981
(I said that I didn't need more time,)

3227
02:39:37,982 --> 02:39:40,182
(but it looks like I need more time.)

3228
02:39:40,183 --> 02:39:44,422
(Amidst confusion and worries,)

3229
02:39:45,082 --> 02:39:48,321
(the secret dates begin.)

3230
02:39:48,322 --> 02:39:50,991
(Will we have time to talk again?)

3231
02:39:50,992 --> 02:39:55,232
(Let's do a good job of climbing over the big mountain.)

3232
02:39:55,492 --> 02:39:58,401
(The dates take place secretly.)

3233
02:39:58,402 --> 02:40:00,001
(It's where people get married.)

3234
02:40:00,002 --> 02:40:01,801
(The price is 48,000 dollars.)

3235
02:40:01,802 --> 02:40:04,071
(I wanted to talk to her,)

3236
02:40:04,072 --> 02:40:07,042
(but the atmosphere was bad.)

3237
02:40:07,043 --> 02:40:09,672
(For the first time, time felt slow when I was with him.)

3238
02:40:10,242 --> 02:40:11,942
(I felt so hurt.)

3239
02:40:11,943 --> 02:40:14,342
(I realized that I didn't need more time.)

3240
02:40:14,343 --> 02:40:16,052
(I am ruined.)

3241
02:40:16,812 --> 02:40:18,921
(It's 1 day before the final decision,)

3242
02:40:18,922 --> 02:40:20,982
(and nothing is certain.)
