(Adapted from the serialized work "Reborn"
by Qiang Yu)

15
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,500
I've texted you many times.

16
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,860
You didn't reply to me at all.

17
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,020
Why did you leave without telling me?

18
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,900
You can choose not to reply to me.

19
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,900
But you should at least tell me why.

20
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,390
I've texted you many times.

21
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,830
You didn't reply to me at all.

22
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,180
Why did you leave without telling me?

23
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:43,510
Why?

24
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,740
You can choose to ignore me.

25
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,340
But at least you need to tell me why.

26
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,240
That was great.

27
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,990
I think I can learn
a thing or two from you.

28
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,460
I know my fault now.

29
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,460
But speaking of which,

30
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,340
how did you manage

31
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:05,300
to keep a straight face

32
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,600
while saying those mushy words?

33
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,760
You're truly something else.

34
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,860
Who's that girl?

35
00:03:20,287 --> 00:03:30,062
=Episode 14=
(Running Out of Courage)

36
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,150
Gather around.

37
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,270
Guys,

38
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,300
we've completed
the breaststroke technique lesson.

39
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,510
For this lesson, it's free practice.

40
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,830
Those who said who couldn't
hold their breath before this

41
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,430
should take this time to practice.

42
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:50,510
Safety first. Dismissed.

43
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:54,020
Keep an eye on them.

44
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,390
Don't you think you should explain

45
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,780
why you left without bidding farewell?

46
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,950
Did your family
make things difficult for you?

47
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,780
What do you plan to do next?

48
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,460
Sheng.

49
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:42,630
What are you doing?

50
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,510
What were you two talking about?

51
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,100
Sheng.

52
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,460
Sheng.

53
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:07,020
I don't know if it's because of
the dramas you've watched lately.

54
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,420
Maybe you do have
some sort of hero complex.

55
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:12,870
But Qiao Qingyu's family situation
is very complicated.

56
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,900
I suggest you stay away from her.

57
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,870
I just want to help her out.

58
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,190
What's wrong with that?

59
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,220
Huh?

60
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:30,950
Was he angry?

61
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:33,780
What does that mean?

62
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,580
He already owned up to it just now.

63
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,340
That can't be.

64
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:42,460
That is the case.

65
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,710
Say, why do some people
go against their promises

66
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,390
after making them?

67
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,190
That can only prove

68
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,830
that she hadn't figured things out

69
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,270
when she made that promise to you.

70
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,070
If so, she can choose
not to make that promise.

71
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,420
She's just tricking me.

72
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,220
Why are you being fierce to me?

73
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,150
I'm not the one
who went against my promise.

74
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,340
It's fine
that she went against her promises.

75
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,870
But she wouldn't even tell me anything.

76
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,510
Don't worry about it.

77
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,220
Since Qiao Qingyu is avoiding you,

78
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,640
that means she has feelings for you.

79
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,870
If not, she could've
confronted you directly.

80
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,710
She has a guilty conscience.

81
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:25,020
Who said it was Qiao Qingyu?

82
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:27,630
Did you not?

83
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,270
It's just my wild guess.

84
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,640
Hey. If you're free,

85
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,390
you should show some concern
for your father.

86
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,580
I heard
that the family members of a patient

87
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,720
intercepted him
at the hospital's entrance this morning.

88
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,190
Why should I?

89
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,150
Listen.

90
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,510
To him,

91
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,750
that's nothing uncommon.

92
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,580
This time, it's different.
It's quite a huge deal.

93
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,070
It's all over the news.

94
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,070
That's pretty good.

95
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,630
Now, everyone can see his true colors.

96
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,780
Have the family members
of Patient 15 signed the agreement?

97
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:57,630
No.

98
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,540
They haven't signed it yet.

99
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:04,580
Ming Sheng?

100
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,540
Your father isn't around.

101
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:11,310
When will his surgery end?

102
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,780
It's fine. I can wait for him.

103
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:22,900
Have you read today's Huanzhou Daily?

104
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,980
The house is so messy.

105
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:33,590
You're back.

106
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,900
Let me change it.

107
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,940
Mr. Chen and his wife

108
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,350
have gone on a trip.

109
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:50,180
They entrusted their dog to me.

110
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,180
Are you seeing this?

111
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:53,350
You should pee on this mat
if you want to pee.

112
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,660
I always thought
that keeping a dog would be easy

113
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:58,470
and fun.

114
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,700
I never expected it

115
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:03,300
to be more tiring

116
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:04,630
than raising a child.

117
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,940
I don't know what this little guy

118
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,020
ate last night.

119
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,350
It has a stomach ache.

120
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,880
It couldn't sleep for the entire night.

121
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,990
Both of us didn't sleep well last night.

122
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:18,720
Have you had dinner?

123
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,990
I've called for food delivery.

124
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,470
Let's have dinner together.

125
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:31,020
You placed the box there, huh?

126
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:35,820
I always wanted to hand it to you
once I'm done organizing it.

127
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,230
But I didn't have the time.

128
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,230
Why?

129
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,750
Haven't you always hated Mom?

130
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,510
Why did you keep our photo album?

131
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,540
You weren't even five years old

132
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,990
when your mother left the family.

133
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,660
Although she didn't raise you,

134
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,940
I know how important

135
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:55,020
she is to you.

136
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,060
Therefore,

137
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,590
I thought that I should keep
all of the photos

138
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,270
you two had taken together

139
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,750
and hand them to you

140
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:06,110
after you've grown up.

141
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,350
This way,

142
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:13,300
you'll feel like

143
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,700
your mother has never left your side.

144
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,080
It's just that she used another way

145
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,510
to keep you company as you grow up.

146
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:21,820
Go now.

147
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:24,940
What a joke.

148
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:27,940
Don't you think

149
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,270
it'd remind me

150
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:32,270
that my mother left me
when I was five years old?

151
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:39,990
My son,

152
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,150
I'm sorry.

153
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,020
Especially for what I did previously.

154
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,120
I donated all of the scores

155
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,630
that your mother had performed before.

156
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,590
I was at fault.

157
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:51,520
I was too inconsiderate.

158
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,920
I didn't care about your feelings...

159
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,230
Don't think that I'll forgive you

160
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,720
just because you're saying all this.

161
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,700
Why did you chase my mother away

162
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,940
if you truly cared about me?

163
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,510
Regarding the situation
between your mother and me,

164
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,420
you'll understand

165
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,520
when you grow up.

166
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,780
You're using that excuse again.

167
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,150
That's the only excuse you'll ever use.

168
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,300
You always say
that I'm too young to understand things.

169
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,400
You keep everything from me.

170
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,350
I'm already 18 years old.

171
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,630
I have the right to know the truth.

172
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,420
And I know how pretentious and fake

173
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,540
you are with the excuses you use.

174
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:30,020
I know that the famous Dr. Ming

175
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:31,510
is staying at home

176
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,940
because of a medical accident.

177
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,750
You were suspended
by the hospital, weren't you?

178
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,180
You remind me

179
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,660
of myself when I was 18 years old.

180
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,750
We like to view the world
with an unorthodox perspective.

181
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:00,660
So, are you saying

182
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,270
that growing up means

183
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,590
that you'll form
an orthodox perspective on the world?

184
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:06,180
That's not it.

185
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:08,700
Growing up means

186
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,990
that you'll truly possess
the values you cherish.

187
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,820
The values a person holds

188
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,300
will decide how he sees things.

189
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:18,870
However,

190
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,470
you'll only obtain

191
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,390
mature values that you truly own

192
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,540
when you reach a certain age.

193
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:27,900
This way, you won't develop

194
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,230
a one-sided and narrow view

195
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:32,150
towards certain topics.

196
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,870
Hey, you never told me anything.

197
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:35,360
What makes you think

198
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,200
that I'll develop
a one-sided and narrow view?

199
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,990
Can you save your breath?

200
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,540
Stop trying to come up
with these stupid lessons for me.

201
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,180
If you truly understood what you said,

202
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,230
if you truly possessed
the values you cherished,

203
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,270
I'm sure you wouldn't let
a patient sue you

204
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,990
until you're suspended from work.

205
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,350
Now that you're unable to work,

206
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,350
you can take it as a holiday.

207
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:11,780
Don't act tough

208
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,390
and do something you suck at.

209
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,020
For example, rearing a dog

210
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,470
and being a good father.

211
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:35,900
Coming.

212
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:40,270
Who's there?

213
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,020
Greetings, Mrs. Qiao.

214
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:47,750
Mumu?

215
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,590
Are you looking for Qingyu?

216
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:50,420
That's right.

217
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,940
There's no one at home today.

218
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,440
I came here on a classmate's bike.

219
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,180
I brought a lot of
revision materials with me.

220
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,060
They're quite heavy.

221
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,870
I hope Qingyu can help me out.

222
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,990
It's downstairs. We'll be done soon.

223
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,940
Let me call for her.

224
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:04,780
You may come in.

225
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:05,780
Mrs. Qiao, it's fine.

226
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,420
Alright.

227
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:21,870
Just use a tiny bit

228
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:24,020
of this concealer,

229
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,300
and you can conceal
the scar on your face.

230
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,150
Mumu.

231
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,940
I'm very upset.

232
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:47,700
I know.

233
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,700
You said that you were envious
of the courage I possessed.

234
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:55,990
But I think

235
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:57,540
my courage is running out.

236
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:02,350
I don't know whether or not

237
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:06,020
I'm doing the right thing.

238
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:14,180
I've overestimated my abilities.

239
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,060
I want them to own up to their mistakes.

240
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,470
But I lost.

241
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,420
Not only did I not uphold justice
for my sister,

242
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,590
but I also made my family angry.

243
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,060
Even if you've lost,
that doesn't mean you're wrong.

244
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:40,870
Actually, I knew what awaited me

245
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:43,300
after they found me.

246
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,270
They can beat me, reprimand me,

247
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:47,990
they can punish me however they like.

248
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,990
But they want me to admit
that I was wrong.

249
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:54,870
I didn't.

250
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,300
It's because I didn't think
that I was wrong.

251
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,660
One day,

252
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,390
I'll prove that I'm right.

253
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,300
I will make them apologize to me

254
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,110
and Qiao Beiyu.

255
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:22,350
I once read a quote from a book.

256
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:27,900
"Growing up is the inevitable decay
one must go through in a lifetime."

257
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,390
Therefore, I suppose growing up

258
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,060
means that we have to endure such pain.

259
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,230
Will you be my friend forever?

260
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,180
Of course.

261
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,350
I'm so envious of you.

262
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:54,390
No matter how upset you are,

263
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,350
you're able to smile.

264
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:02,820
Do you know how
I forget about my pain and suffering?

265
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,260
I dance.

266
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,310
Qingyu,

267
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:10,350
you should join the dance club.

268
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:15,220
Actually, I have always liked dancing

269
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:18,070
because of my elder sister.

270
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:21,260
But my mother, she...

271
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:23,350
If there's a chance,

272
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:25,310
I want to realize her dream for her.

273
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,390
Now, Fang Hao picks her up
and drops her off at school daily.

274
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,110
We also added another gate to our house.

275
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,550
We've changed our lock as well.

276
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:34,740
Please don't worry.

277
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,630
We'll keep an eye on her 24/7.

278
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,840
I know, I know.

279
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,390
I'll take her back as soon as possible

280
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,070
and give everyone an account.

281
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:46,600
Alright.

282
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,460
Please wait.
Fang Hao wishes to speak with you.

283
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:51,180
Dad.

284
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:54,420
Qing will have her mid-semester exam
in a few days.

285
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,070
I'll keep a close eye on her.

286
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,700
She won't be able to go anywhere.

287
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,790
How could you tell him that?

288
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:03,740
Lusheng.

289
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,150
I'm begging you.

290
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:08,150
Listen to me for once.

291
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,180
We've already lost Bei.

292
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:09,720
That's not it.

293
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,190
We can't afford to sacrifice Qing now.

294
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:11,900
Hand me the phone.

295
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,890
We mustn't send Qing back
and let her suffer there.

296
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:15,160
Call Dad and explain it to him.

297
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,700
She got herself
in deep trouble this time.

298
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,320
Don't you think

299
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,640
she should go back and apologize?

300
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,940
They've already punished her physically
and reprimanded her.

301
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:24,980
Don't hang up!

302
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,150
What else do they want?

303
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,220
You're her father!

304
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:31,310
Can't you save your daughter for once?

305
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,390
Hey, can we be reasonable for once?

306
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,000
If we don't take her back this time,

307
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,030
we won't be able
to return to Nanqiao Village again!

308
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:41,740
Li Fanghao!

309
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,310
This time, you have to listen to me.

310
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,390
We have to go back
and apologize to them!

311
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:47,790
Hand me the phone!

312
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,940
Hello? I will never let Qing return to
that place even if it means I have to die!

313
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,920
Have you lost your mind?

314
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,660
Your entire family has no conscience!

315
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,460
Li Fanghao!

316
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,150
You!

317
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,030
Back then...

318
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,700
Back then, I should've taken Bei with me

319
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,460
and left this place when
you and your family

320
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,310
tried to force me to
give birth to a boy!

321
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:21,940
I should've left you!

322
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,030
I should've left this family!

323
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:27,630
Fine by me!

324
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,790
Let's sever our ties!

325
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,740
You want a divorce, huh?

326
00:19:58,940 --> 00:19:59,870
Qiao Lusheng.

327
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,220
You went overboard.

328
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:05,630
You're just a coward.

329
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:10,900
You don't even dare to mention
the word "divorce!"

330
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:20,680
Grandpa called us

331
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,160
and said that you have to go back
and apologize to everyone.

332
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,460
I think Mom knew

333
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,590
that you would suffer if you went back.

334
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,830
She disagreed.

335
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:33,110
That's why Dad and Mom
argued until now.

336
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:37,070
Initially, Qiao Beiyu's miscarriage

337
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,590
was just a rumor.

338
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,030
But you're something else.

339
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,790
You proved them right
and backed it with evidence.

340
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:44,660
Now, everyone on the Internet

341
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,790
is spreading all kinds of rumors.

342
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,940
Jingrui has already gotten a divorce.

343
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,870
He didn't dare to break the news
to Grandma yet.

344
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:52,980
I heard

345
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,630
Aunt Yanfen
was hospitalized out of spite.

346
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,590
Now, Dad and Mom want to get a divorce.

347
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:01,350
I didn't want things
to end up like this either.

348
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,700
Of course I knew
you did it out of kind intentions.

349
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:07,310
You wanted to uphold justice
for Qiao Beiyu.

350
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,030
But now, not only
did you not uphold justice for her,

351
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,460
but you also turned
our family upside down.

352
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:15,440
But I knew
that they murdered Qiao Beiyu.

353
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,150
Do you expect me
to turn a blind eye to that?

354
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:21,660
I don't know.

355
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,420
But can you stop being stubborn?

356
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,420
Regarding this matter,

357
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,660
it won't end
unless you apologize to them.

358
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,420
Qiao Beiyu is dead.

359
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,310
But we still need to survive, you know?

360
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,350
Just take it as if

361
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,700
you're deceiving them.

362
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:40,900
Just apologize to them,

363
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,700
and we can still proceed with our lives.

364
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,630
Can't you do so?

365
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:57,390
Dad, stop drinking.

366
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,590
It's bad for your health.

367
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,740
If only you were sensible

368
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,500
and didn't infuriate me this much.

369
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,390
If so, I suppose I can live longer.

370
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,590
I don't care if you believe me or not.

371
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,220
I didn't want this to happen either.

372
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,520
I didn't want everyone to suffer.

373
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,150
Who's not suffering now?

374
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,790
Isn't your mother suffering?

375
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:30,790
Aren't I suffering?

376
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:34,260
You're trying to kill us all here!

377
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,940
What are you thinking?

378
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,590
I'll return to
the village with you, then.

379
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:48,740
I'll return to Nanqiao Village with you.

380
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,870
You've gotten yourself in deep trouble.

381
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,660
Your grandparents,

382
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:57,390
your uncle and his wife,

383
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:59,180
they won't spare you that easily.

384
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:05,460
If you go back, you'll suffer.

385
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:06,870
What else can I do, then?

386
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:09,390
Everyone thinks that I'm at fault here.

387
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,110
If so, I have to bear the consequences.

388
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,280
I don't care how they'll punish me.

389
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,520
I'm not afraid of them either.

390
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,070
I just don't want you and Mom

391
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:18,350
to argue every day.

392
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:19,390
Fine.

393
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:22,390
At least you're sensible now.

394
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,110
We'll leave tomorrow morning.

395
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,870
Don't tell your mother.

396
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:40,500
Wear thicker clothing tomorrow.

397
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:06,150
Everything is my fault.

398
00:25:06,375 --> 00:25:08,225
I know it's too late to say anything.

399
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,830
But I'll bear the consequences alone.

400
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,350
Grandpa, you may punish me
however you like.

401
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:15,350
You've ruined my son's future!

402
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,460
He's only in his twenties.

403
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,830
How can he face society in the future?

404
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:23,180
I won't do anything

405
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,310
that'll harm my family again.

406
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:25,660
Again?

407
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,700
Now, the entire village knows

408
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:29,080
that Jingrui is adopted.

409
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,660
Your mother doesn't dare to come, huh?

410
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:32,700
How dare you come and apologize alone?

411
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,900
Look at you! You show no remorse at all!

412
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,310
Lusheng.

413
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:40,260
You have to teach her a lesson today!

414
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:41,500
Beat her with this stick!

415
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:44,700
Lusheng!

416
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,980
Why are you still standing there?

417
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:52,180
Dad!

418
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:53,900
Will you do it or not?

419
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,260
Will you do it or not?

420
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,350
Will you do it or not?

421
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:04,740
Dad!

422
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:07,940
Dad!

423
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,390
Dad, please be appeased!

424
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:13,390
Dad.

425
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:30,180
Mom!

426
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:33,390
Dad.

427
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:35,980
Haisheng.

428
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:37,740
Yanfen.

429
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,420
Qingyu is young and insensible.

430
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,420
She disrupted Jingrui's wedding

431
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,420
and caused you guys to be humiliated.

432
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:49,220
That was wrong of her.

433
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,260
But she's still a child.

434
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:53,940
Strictly speaking,

435
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,740
it's my fault as her mother

436
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,980
for not keeping her in check.

437
00:26:59,180 --> 00:26:59,740
Mom.

438
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:03,350
You guys can do whatever you want to me

439
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:07,030
as long as you guys

440
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,460
can be appeased.

441
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,390
Let me apologize to you all.

442
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:12,740
Mom!

443
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,310
Hurry and get up.

444
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,350
What? You think everything will be fine

445
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,830
now that you've apologized to us?

446
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:23,660
Both of your daughters ganged up
to harm my son.

447
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,070
My son is ruined because of you!

448
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:26,940
Jingrui's life is over!

449
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,660
There's no future for him now!

450
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,420
How can I not be angry?

451
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:37,940
Yanfen.

452
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,150
Let's be honest with ourselves today.

453
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:44,790
Even if we've ruined Jingrui's future,

454
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:47,870
what about Beiyu, then?

455
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,630
Beiyu is gone.

456
00:27:58,150 --> 00:27:58,980
Beiyu?

457
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:02,390
What has her death
got to do with Jingrui?

458
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,700
She brought that upon herself.

459
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:04,900
She deserved it!

460
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,590
She deserved to die!

461
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:19,590
Qingyu, stand up.

462
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:22,180
Stand up.

463
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,980
I'm telling you to stand up.

464
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:44,390
Yanfen.

465
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:48,830
Let me tell you this, then.

466
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:50,700
I instructed Qingyu

467
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,310
to do what she did.

468
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:55,390
Mom!

469
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,420
I'll fight you to the end!

470
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,900
How dare you still defend Qingyu?

471
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,070
I'll beat you to death!

472
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:04,630
Yanfen!

473
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:05,590
That's enough!

474
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:06,590
Don't stop me!

475
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:08,900
I'll beat you to death!

476
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:10,740
I'll beat you to death!

477
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:13,030
All three of you are devils!

478
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:14,150
What are you doing?

479
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:15,550
How dare you spout such nonsense?

480
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:16,740
Yanfen!

481
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,740
Dad!

482
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:22,350
Dad, you must uphold justice for us!

483
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:27,030
Mom!

484
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:30,260
Mom, what are you doing?

485
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,150
Mom!

486
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:32,740
Mom!

487
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:35,700
Stop slapping yourself!

488
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:40,460
Mom!

489
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:46,260
Mom!

490
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:47,500
Mom!

491
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:50,900
Stop it!

492
00:29:58,550 --> 00:29:59,740
Come. Let's go home.

493
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:01,070
Let's go.

494
00:30:13,387 --> 00:30:16,612
(Joy, Everlasting Love and Harmony,
100 Years of Happiness)

495
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:33,420
You guys have completely
severed our ties with the family.

496
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:56,830
I'll go and wash the vegetables.

497
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,460
How could we clean up the mess
if I didn't take her back?

498
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,390
Do you think the guys
in our hometown will let us off?

499
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:36,960
I've already thought things through.

500
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,800
I'd take her back and
make her apologize to them.

501
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,750
At most she'll be reprimanded
and caned a few times.

502
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,680
Everything could've been over
had we just endured it.

503
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,720
He's her grandfather.
What do you think he'll do to her?

504
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:45,740
But you?

505
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,630
You came and
turned everything upside down.

506
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,790
I truly don't know
what's wrong with you.

507
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,550
Even if there's something wrong with me,
it's because of your family.

508
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:26,350
I'll be honest with you.

509
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,260
Actually, I think

510
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:33,420
Dad and Grandpa did the right thing.

511
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:37,960
Jingrui did let Beiyu down.

512
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,350
And, I know Grandpa and the rest
hid the truth from everyone.

513
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:42,390
Even if they did
commit mistakes in the past

514
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:44,180
and had to bear the consequences for it,

515
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:47,590
it shouldn't have to come at

516
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:49,420
such a heavy price.

517
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:51,900
What if

518
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:54,500
you knew

519
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,630
that things would end up like this?

520
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,590
Would you still use the same way

521
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,590
to uphold justice for Beiyu?

522
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,110
I'm going to start
living on campus this semester.

523
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:13,700
Dad and Mom argue every day.

524
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,780
And, you sigh all day long.

525
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:17,950
You guys are affecting my studies.

526
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:55,430
Do you want to take a bite?

527
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:58,550
You can only fly
after recovering, you know?

528
00:35:58,740 --> 00:35:59,780
You should eat something.

529
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:01,220
Here.

530
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:20,340
Eat up.

531
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:38,470
Qingyu.

532
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:41,950
I know you don't want to speak with me.

533
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:45,550
If so, just listen to me.

534
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:48,820
I know

535
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,380
you don't like our home.

536
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:54,380
To be honest, I don't like it either.

537
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,260
But if you leave home now,

538
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,780
you're too young to face society.

539
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,150
You'll get bullied.

540
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:04,220
You should hang in there

541
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,180
and bear with it.

542
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:09,910
Once you grow up, complete your studies,

543
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,340
and become a useful person
who can contribute to society,

544
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:14,470
you can do whatever you want by then.

545
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,030
I won't interfere.

546
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,910
Please trust me.

547
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:25,260
I'm at least a credible person.

548
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:49,380
How much money is left
on your cafeteria card?

549
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,590
It's enough for me
to last the entire semester.

550
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:54,430
You should eat something else.
Don't be frugal all the time.

551
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,780
Take a ten-minute nap
if you have the time.

552
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:59,380
Mrs. Qiao, Qingyu.

553
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:00,910
Hello, Mrs. Qiao.

554
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:01,780
Hello.

555
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:03,430
Wait here for me tonight.

556
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:04,030
Okay.

557
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:05,150
I'll go inside with Qingyu.

558
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:05,630
Okay.

559
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:10,860
Mrs. Qiao worries a lot, huh?

560
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:13,740
Although she's very controlling,

561
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:15,860
I know she's doing it for my own good.

562
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:26,860
I mustn't make them angry again.

563
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,660
Since I can't change anything,

564
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:30,630
I should be obedient.

565
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:47,030
Are you sure this will stick?

566
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:01,380
What are you doing?

567
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:02,470
It's nothing.

568
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:03,630
Let me see.

569
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:07,510
Are you crazy?

570
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:10,150
Oh, you fell for it yourself.

571
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:10,740
Geez.

572
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,510
It's called biting off
more than you can chew.

573
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,470
Who told you guys
to bully her all the time?

574
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,630
Bully her all the time?

575
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:17,300
You guys bully her all the time.

576
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,110
Why are you guys
pretending to be saints now?

577
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,070
What's wrong?

578
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:21,880
Does that mean
we cannot get a change of heart

579
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,860
and turn over a new leaf?

580
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:23,630
Yeah.

581
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:25,510
So, you guys should stop bullying her.

582
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:27,380
If not, we'll uphold justice for her.

583
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:29,150
Come. Let's go to the toilet.

584
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:41,910
Hand that to me.

585
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:08,080
(Trivia for Eyesight Protection,
Myopia Prevention, and Hygiene)

586
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:32,070
Someone instructed me
to hand this to you.

587
00:40:39,575 --> 00:40:43,162
(I'll always be there for you
as long as you turn around.)

588
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:04,700
Sheng!

589
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:08,070
You guys can go ahead.

590
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,110
I've already handed it to her.

591
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:15,180
Did she say anything?

592
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:16,550
Nope.

593
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:19,300
How did she react, then?

594
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:20,630
She didn't react much.

595
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:21,700
She didn't react much?

596
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:24,150
She did.

597
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:25,740
She did react.

598
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:28,950
She was deep in her thoughts.

599
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:30,630
Deep in her thoughts?

600
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:37,380
What does that mean?

601
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:51,910
Qiao Qingyu.

602
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:53,680
You remind me of something.

603
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,400
Just a couple of days ago,

604
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,470
I saw Mingsheng getting out of a taxi with a girl.

605
00:41:57,470 --> 00:41:58,780
Was it you?

606
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,700
Was Qingyu staying at
Ming Sheng's grandfather's unit

607
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,260
