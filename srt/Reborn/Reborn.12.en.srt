00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,080

I think its legs are injured.

63
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,930
Was it because of a fall?

00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,700
Maybe.

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,850

78
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:31,820
Yeah.

79
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,100
Were you calling it just now?

80
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,530
It's because of the sound it makes.

81
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,050
Don't you think that's a fitting name?

82
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,290
You already named it, huh?

83
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:42,020

90
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,930
I've inquired about the couple

91
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:57,960
in the hospital for you.

92
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,820
They're from Xiang Lake.

93
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,900

94
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,020
Don't worry.

95
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:08,460
Thanks.

96
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:11,850
You don't need to.

97
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,490
Anyway, I never expected you

98
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,260
to be bold enough to uphold justice

99
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:17,820
for your elder sister.

100
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:19,580
In the past, I thought

101
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,170
you hated her.

102
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:28,050
The same blood flows in
Qiao Beiyu and I.

103
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,140
That cannot be defined

104
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,320
by fondness or hatred alone.

105
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:35,370
I just think she's very pitiful.

106
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,340
But I suppose
our entire family is pitiful.

107
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,660
That's not true.

108
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,020
If I didn't exist,

109
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:48,700
Qiao Beiyu could've grown up in Shunyun.

110
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,410
She could've led a different life.

111
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,930
Therefore, I was the one
who stole her place from her.

112
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:55,410
I don't have the right to hate her.

113
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,370
She has the right
to hate me all she wants.

114
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:03,660
She won't hate you.

115
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,580
You don't need to console me.

116
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,050
I know what's going on.

117
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:10,220
It's precisely because
that I stole her life

118
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:12,140
that I have to uphold justice for her.

119
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,220
It's my responsibility.

120
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,780
I would do so

121
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:16,140
even if I hated her.

122
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,780
But I'm relieved to hear

123
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,340
that Jingrui is fine.

124
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:26,610
Anyway,

125
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:27,970
I'm truly impressed

126
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,490
by your courage

127
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,580
and the actions you took.

128
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,820
Don't you think
Jiujiu and I are very similar?

129
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,940
We both fell
right after learning how to fly.

130
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,820
You two will definitely
recover and get better.

131
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,130
But before that,

132
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,940
we have to fill our tummies.

133
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,370
Only then will we be able
to recover quickly.

134
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,700
Thank you.

135
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:04,890
Alright.

136
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:05,420
Goodbye.

137
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,420
Is this Mrs. Jiang?

138
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,580
Sorry about this.
I'm Qiao Qingyu's mother.

139
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,220
That's right. I called you two days ago.

140
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,890
I want to ask Jiang Nian

141
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,250
if Qingyu contacted her before this.

142
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,300
Think harder.

143
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,970
Was there anything
you forgot to tell me?

144
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:23,770
You've heard about it, huh?

145
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,820
Yeah. You see, you know a lot of people.

146
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,960
I thought you could definitely
come up with something.

150

Think closely.

151
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,820
Try to think harder.

152
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:41,460
You...

153
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:50,970
Hello?

154
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:51,420
Hello?

155
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,960
Is this Qingjiang Road Police Station?

156
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:55,220
That's right.
Are you Qiao Qingyu's family member?

157
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:57,130
That's right. I'm her mother.

158
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,560
We just found
a female body by the river.

159
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,700
She's about in her twenties.

160
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,770
I'm sure we'll find her soon...

161
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:05,940
I...

162
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,460
I'll talk to you later.

163
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:09,580

164
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,850

165
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:11,940
What's wrong?

166
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,700
By the river...

167
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,300
They found a female body.

168
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,100
Judging from the characteristics,

169
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,650
she isn't Qiao Qingyu.

170
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:22,970
Her age doesn't match.

171
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,770
I'm afraid they're mistaken.

172
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:25,580
Wait. What?

173
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,130
I want to take a look!

174
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,490
Fang Hao.

175
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:32,100
Her age doesn't match.
Why are we heading there?

176
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,010
Wait. Listen to me.

177
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:33,940
Wait a moment.

178
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,610
Fang Hao.

179
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:37,820
I don't want them to be mistaken!

180
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,100
No. That isn't Qing.

181
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,650
What if it's Qing?

182
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,610
That can't be.

183
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:43,850
If there's anything,

184
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,700
the cops will update us, okay?

185
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:10,890
Is the food okay?

186
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,300
Will you leave

187
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,220
after recovering from your sickness?

188
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:24,890
Where will you go?

189
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:30,770
I'll go somewhere bigger
and more crowded.

190
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:35,490
Beining? Or Jiangzhou?

191
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,420
Do you have any money?

192
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,820
Last time, you printed the files for me.

193
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,220
You took me to a doctor.

194
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,370
And, you allowed me
to stay in your house temporarily.

195
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:48,100
I'll pay you when the time comes.

196
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,650
It's just that I've lost my purse.

197
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,280
I'll pay you back
once I make some money.

198
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,540
Qiao Qingyu, what do you mean by this?

199
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,060
Did you think I helped you
just because I wanted your money?

200
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,370
Since you've decided to leave,

201
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:00,370
I'll join you.

202
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,580
Anywhere is fine with me.

203
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,610
Don't misunderstand me.

204
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,730
I wanted to run away from home anyway.

205
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,220
Now, I have a companion.

206
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,370
It's pretty good.

207
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:15,040
And you...

208
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,010
You always push yourself
too hard and end up ill.

209
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,820
I can't rest at ease
if I leave you alone.

210
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,770
I know that you're serious about this.

211
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,180
But I hope
that you won't act on impulse.

212
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,540
I'm not acting on impulse.

213
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,060
That's not it. I mean,

214
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:30,820
thank you for always helping me out.

215
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,010
You even came all the way here
just to find me.

216
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:33,960
I owe you one.

217
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,340
I'm not helping you just because
I'm compassionate, you know?

218
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,250
At the end of the day,

219
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,250
it's my call.

220
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,650
You can't tell me what to do.

221
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,370
I'm going to leave with you.

222
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:09,700
I'm going to leave with you.

223
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:15,130
Okay.

00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,580

228
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,200
She studied at
the same school as you guys.

229
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:47,800
No, we haven't.

230
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,020
Have you seen this girl before?

231
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:49,140
No.

232
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:49,730
Take a look.

233
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,060
Have you seen this child before?

234
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,580

Qingyu!

238

239
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,460
What are you doing?
Watch where you're going!

240
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:13,700
Sorry about that.

241
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:15,730
Qingyu.

242
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,300
Sorry about this.

243
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,100
What are you doing?

244
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,940
Mom, that's not Qingyu.

245
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:24,490
Anyway,

246
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:25,890
we've already made a police report.

247
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:28,300
I'm sure they're more efficient than us.

248
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,250
Let's head back,

249
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:30,940
okay?

251
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,610

252
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,220
Let's head back.

253
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,770
Mom?

254
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,420
What do you think?

255
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,340
That sounded great.

256
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,890
It's not a free performance, you know?

257
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,060
What is that?

258
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,970
Although it's not valuable,

259
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,460
it's my lucky charm.

260
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,700
I always had it with me.
You can have it.

261
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:58,850
Qiao Qingyu, that was just a joke.

262
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:00,130
I don't want that.

263
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,370
I know.

266

You're the only one who's by my side.

267

Here's a token of my gratitude.

268
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:19,770
Alright. Token accepted.

269
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:23,540
If so,

270
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,760
this will be our keepsake.

271
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,300
But don't take it as a token of love.

272
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:28,820
I won't take advantage of you.

273
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,540
What are you doing?

274
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,100
I'm fine. Give me a second.

275
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,180
It's only proper
to return a gift with a gift.

276
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:03,890
Do you know something?

277
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,450
I already saw it

278
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:06,610
when I first moved here.

279
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:10,100
Strictly speaking,
I got to know it first

280
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,340
before knowing you.

281
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,690
I think I can just take a nap

282
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:27,740
on the chair today.

283
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:29,540
No need for that.

284
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:32,300
You can sleep here tonight.
Sleep on the bed.

285
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:34,540
I'll sleep on the carpet.

286
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,610
Oh yeah.

287
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:12,740
You see,

288
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,130
the curtain is quite flimsy.

289
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:15,440
But I'm a gentleman.

290
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,880
I won't sneak a peek
while you're sleeping. Don't worry.

291
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:26,890
Qiao Qingyu,

292
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,690
why don't I tell you a bedtime story?

293
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,300
Sure.

294
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,650
Do you still remember

295
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:35,410
our first encounter?

296
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:39,650
You were in a fight.

297
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,720
You were making a scene by the canal.

298
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,360
You wanted me
to compensate for your plant.

299
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:46,780
But I bit you after that.

300
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:48,130
I suppose we're even.

301
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,340
Actually,
that wasn't our first encounter.

302
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:01,100
Five years ago,

303
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:04,610
I went to Huanzhou Grand Theatre
to look for my mother.

304
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:07,980
Sheng, wait inside.

305
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,500
Your mother will come and find you

306
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,780
once she's done.

307
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,370
Everyone, hurry up.

308
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,780
We have a meeting in ten minutes.

309
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,340
3, 2, 3, 4.

310
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:18,100
5, extend your leg.

311
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,780
5, 6, 7, and go.

312
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,540
1, 2, 3, 4,

313
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,210

00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,740

317
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:29,980
5, 6, 7, 8.

318
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,610
4, 2, 3, 4.

319
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:32,690
Stop.

320
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:33,980
Remember the moves

321
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:34,850
I corrected just now.

322
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:36,450
It's almost time. Go and do your makeup.

323
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:39,130

324

2, 2, 3, 4,

326
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,930
5, 6, 7...

327
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:01,370
I never expected us

328
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,130
to encounter each other again
after five years.

329
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:06,540
However,

330
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,410
I could recognize you at first glance.

331
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,300
Wait, you sneaked a peak at me.

332
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:15,850
I didn't.

333
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:17,930
It was you who started dancing.

334
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,130
And, you should thank me

335
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:20,920
for providing you
with a live backing track.

336
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:22,130
However,

337
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,300
you were more adorable

338
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,450
when you were younger.

339
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:29,100
People were doing Swan Lake

You're the ugly duckling.

342
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,690
What was that sound?

343
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,890
I think it's an earthquake.

344
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:40,980
Is it?

345
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,130
Yes. Come here.

347
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:49,130
Don't worry. I've read about it before.

348
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:50,040
According to the books,

349
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,080
we just need to take cover

350

in the corner next
to a load-bearing wall.

351
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:53,480
We'll be fine, then.

352
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,060

00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:37,130
don't worry.
If an earthquake does occur,

371
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,240
you'll be the first person
I'll take with me.

372
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:45,060
♪Cradling the same story we both knew♪

373
00:23:46,272 --> 00:23:49,514
♪Thankfully, we were naive enough♪

374
00:23:49,659 --> 00:23:53,117
♪And brave just in time♪

375
00:23:53,161 --> 00:24:00,568
♪To make sure our moments weren't lost to time♪

376
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:04,340
How else do you want me
to criticize you?

377
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:07,060
You failed to keep an eye
on your daughter!

378
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,690
Useless fool!

379
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,500
Don't just stand there.

380
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,130
Go and think of something!

381
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,980
Stop being angry. What's the point
of reprimanding Lusheng now?

382
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,370
He's already searching for her.

383
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,780
Dear folks,

384
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:35,410
we're at Chaoyang New Village now.

385
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:36,610
Last night,

386
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:37,640
our community news hotline

387
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,040
received a call from Ms. Li,
a concerned resident seeking help.

388
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,520
Her daughter, who is currently
in her second year of high school,

389
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,760
has suddenly run away from home.

390
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,450
As for the exact reasons,
we have no idea.

391
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:46,300
Next,

392
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,340
we'll visit Ms. Li and her family

393
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,690
to have a grasp of the situation.

394
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:51,890
If any of you have any leads on her,

395
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:53,980
please contact
our program department in time.

396
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:57,170
The cops have notified
the bus stations, airports,

397
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:59,020
and train stations.

398
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:02,300
They said they would notify us
immediately upon receiving news.

399
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,930
Someone from the county said

400
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:08,410
that they saw Qingyu.

401
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,650
They've gone to retrieve
the surveillance camera footage.

402
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:13,000
They'll send the scanned picture
to us by this afternoon.

403
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:19,450
Dad, have some tea.

404
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:21,930
This family

405
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:23,780
is ruined all because of you!

406
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:30,170
Why did you blame it on Fang Hao?

407
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:36,930
Dad, Mom, the reporters are here.

408
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,360
I didn't want it
to end up like this either.

409
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,450
I've tried all kinds of ways
to communicate with them.

410
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:08,100
But no matter what I did,

411
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,850
I couldn't uphold justice for Beiyu.

412
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,980
Since everyone knows the truth now,

413
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,160
no matter how angry they are,

414
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,170
they should take it
as this is what they owed Beiyu.

415
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:24,980
I think the weather is turning colder.

416
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:27,060
Yeah.

417
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:31,020
Remember to wear extra clothing
during and after work.

418
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:35,540
I need to leave early today.

419
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,300
The matron had introduced

420
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,340
a blind date partner to me.

421
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,410
We're going to have a meal
and watch a movie together.

422
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:41,340
Oh.

423
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,130
You're very busy usually.

424
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:46,780
It's rare for you to have time to relax.
You should go ahead.

425
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,980
Have you visited Ming Sheng
for the past few days?

426
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:00,080
He went to visit his mother in France.

427
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,610
He'll only return in a few more days.

428
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,100
I saw him at the
surgical theater's entrance yesterday.

429
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,410
I don't think I was mistaken.

430
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,650
So, he didn't come here to find you?

431
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:55,690
Sheng.

432
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,020
It's my father!

433
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:00,890
Don't make a sound.

434
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:15,980
What's with the sudden inspection?

435
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,100
You didn't pick up when I called you.

436
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,300
When did you come back?

437
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:30,890
Why didn't you notify me?

438
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:37,060
Why should I?

439
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,020
I came back after I got tired of France.

440
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,340
I'm a grown-up now.

441
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:41,780
Why should I notify you

442
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:42,930
when I come back?

443
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,300
Why did you draw the curtains
this early in the day?

444
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,800
It's like you have something to hide.

445
00:28:58,130 --> 00:28:59,450
Here are your living expenses.

446
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,850
Don't just eat instant noodles
all the time.

447
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,450
Remember to buy something nutritious
for yourself.

448
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,260
Alright. I'll be leaving now.

449
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:19,130
You kept complaining that
I treat you like a child all the time.

450
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,500
Let me ask you this, then.

451
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:23,610
What's the definition
of a grown-up, then?

452
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:27,450
A grown-up has freedom.

453
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,690
Freedom of speech, thinking,

454
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,340
and freedom to act.

455
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,260
Your understanding is superficial.

456
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,500
By having freedom as a grown-up,

457
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,410
it also means

458
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:43,650
that you have to bear responsibility
for everything you do.

459
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:47,370
That freedom only exists
under responsibility.

460
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:50,100
Children have the most freedom.

461
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,170
Why is that the case?

462
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,780
It's because they do not need to

463
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,540
bear any responsibilities.

464
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,130
See you.

465
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:17,840
That young girl looked quite obedient.

466
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,690
Why did she run away from home
out of the blue?

467
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:20,740
I'm not sure either.

468
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:23,540
I heard that she stabbed her classmate

469
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:25,260
at school.

470
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:27,170
My goodness. That's unbelievable.

471
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:29,300
Right now, the TV stations

472
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,000
and the police station
are searching for her.

473
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,340
Even so, they couldn't find her.

474
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,540
Where do you think

475
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,820
that girl could be?

476
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:38,690
I think I saw this plot
in a TV drama before.

477
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:39,690
What?

478
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:54,130
Did I cause you trouble?

479
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:57,100
Not at all. I'll change
my door lock tomorrow.

480
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:00,130
That's what my father does.
He conducts sudden inspections.

481
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,740
He's a terrifying control freak.

482
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:05,240
That's why I don't want
to spend any time with him.

483
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,640
I don't want to return
to that deserted house as well.

484
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,300
You're still longing for the home
you had when you were little, huh?

485
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:14,410
There's nothing to long for.

486
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,980
My mother will never come back anyway.

487
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:20,170
That home is never complete.

488
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:27,040
Say, shouldn't adults
be more reasonable than us?

489
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,100
Why do they turn a blind eye
to the mistakes they see?

490
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:33,300
When we were young,

491
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:35,340
they taught us

492
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:39,020
to be honest, kind, and brave.

493
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:40,300
But them?

494
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,260
They didn't achieve that themselves.

495
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,580
When I was young, I also thought

496
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:47,780
that my parents were
honest, kind, and sincere.

497
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:49,890
But after that, I realized

498
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,820
that they were timid, selfish, and cold.

499
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,780
If I have to turn into someone
as detestable as that when I grow up,

500
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,020
I would rather stay a teenager forever.

501
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,260
Anyway,

502
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:07,080
I'll become fatter, taller,
grow a mustache,

503
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,580
and grow some wrinkles when I grow up.

504
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:11,340
But I want to be
an honest person forever.

505
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,690
In my heart,
I'll always be a shining youth.

506
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:21,650
I don't have a fork.

507
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:24,410
Oh, sorry about that.

508
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,100
I'll get you a pair of chopsticks.

509
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:40,820
Jiang Xiaoli,
I'm in trouble because of you!

510
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:44,300
Can you please stop this?

511
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,450
I won't!

512
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,850
I want everyone to hear me!

513
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:47,780
I!

514
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:48,400
That's Mumu.

515
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,020
Jiang Xiaoli, you'll be the death of me!

516
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:50,880
Wait for me inside.

517
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,930
I'll head out for a second.

518
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,340
I'll return soon.

519
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,540
You're taking it out on your wife
and child when you're drunk.

520
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,820
Are you even a man?

521
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:01,100
Stupid brat,
this is none of your business!

522
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:02,980
Are you sick in the head?

523
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:04,200
Just leave! Ignore him!

524
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,410
Mind your own business!

525
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:06,300
I, Wang Zheng,

526
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:08,100
once owned three companies!

527
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:09,930
I had over 100 employees!

528
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:10,540
Stop shouting!

529
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:11,200
Hurry and leave!

530
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,160
I've already arranged everything
for my immigration

531
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,690
and my child's university plans!

532
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:17,690
But now, I've lost everything!

533
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:21,690
It's all because of you!

534
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,210
Were you startled?

535
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:29,890
You see,

536
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,060
Mumu's family has it rough as well.

537
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:34,720
Her father's business

538
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,100
was doing pretty good before this.

539
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:38,410
After that, he was scammed.

540
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,540
He never recovered after that.

541
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:43,260
He drank day and night.
Now, his liver is busted.

542
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,020
Since then,

543
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,500
his temper has gotten worse and worse.

544
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:48,890
He stirs up trouble every day.

545
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:52,100
Mumu is so pitiful.

546
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,580
Mumu and her mother
had no choice either.

547
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,580
Before this, I wanted to help her out.

548
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:02,500
But whenever

549
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,130
I brought the topic up,

550
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,610
she didn't say a single word.

551
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:09,500
To other people,

552
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:12,210
Mumu is beautiful,

553
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:13,760
and great at her studies.

554
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,080
She's also on the class committee
and a top student at that.

555
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:16,810
She's perfect.

556
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:19,580
Say,

557
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:22,420
how was she able
to hide all these secrets?

558
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,020
Maybe it's because her image
at school is too perfect.

559
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:29,060
That's why she didn't want anyone else

560
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,290
to see her flawed side.

561
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,460
But I heard from my father

562
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:37,580
that Mumu's father

563
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:39,500
has at most
three to five years left to live.

564
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:42,130
Three to five years?

565
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:42,770
That's right.

566
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:52,500
What?

567
00:34:57,290 --> 00:34:58,730
Now that I've run away from home,

568
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:01,290
do you think my parents
will face the same thing after...

569
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:03,290
Hey, don't overthink it.

570
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,860
You don't understand
the situation in her family.

571
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:07,610
Mumu hates her family.

572
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:08,500
I also hate...

573
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,170
My father.

574
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,060
Hmm.

575
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:55,460
57, 58, 59, 60.

576
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:10,250
36.7 degrees Celsius.

577
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:15,460
You see, having a fever

578
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:16,860
is your immune system

579
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:17,980
undergoing a system upgrade.

580
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:19,650
When a child has a fever,

581
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,040
it's actually part of

582
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,810
the immune system's
self-development process.

583
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:24,810
It may seem like a bad thing,

584
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,250
but in reality, it's good for you.

585
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:29,170
Congratulations on conquering the level.

586
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:33,130
If only the troubles
we have to face as grown-ups

587
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:34,770
can be overcome quickly

588
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:36,840
just like a fever

589
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,460
and let us get back on the right track.

590
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,730
You're already doing very well.

591
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,730
Do you have white sugar and chilies?

592
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,060
Huh?

593
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:54,080
Why did you mix them?

594
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,500
Are you going to eat it like that?

595
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,130
How could it be nice?

596
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:00,980
This is what I had since young.

597
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,290
Give it a try.

598
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:06,980
No thanks.

599
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:10,420
Oh, by the way,

600
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:12,690
the owner of the breakfast stall
asked me something.

601
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:14,900
He asked me why I could eat
that much every day.

602
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,060
I told him

603
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:18,650
that I was a healthy teenager
who was growing up.

604
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:24,020
Ming Sheng, I think I should leave now.

605
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:26,770
I've almost fully recovered.

606
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:29,100
Everyone nearby recognizes me.

607
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:31,810
And, you buy plenty of food every day.

608
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,500
People will suspect you eventually.

609
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:34,940
Alright.

610
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,810
Since you've already decided to leave,

611
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,020
let's make our preparations later.

612
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,080
Later,

613
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,290
we should come up with a list

614
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:44,290
and prepare everything we need
for the journey.

615
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:50,060
However, from tomorrow onward,

616
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:51,770
you must do everything I say.

617
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:52,980
What gives?

618
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,330
Because I'm more experienced than you
when it comes to living alone.

619
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,770
Because I'm your only partner

620
00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:00,330
for a long journey ahead

621
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:02,290
in your life.

622
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,210
Hurry and finish it.

623
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:10,900
Once you're done, we'll depart.

624
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:12,500
Try this.

625
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:13,770
Huh?

626
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:14,500
Try one.

627
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:24,060
Okay.

628
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:25,610
It's pretty good.

629
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:44,900
Stay out of my business! Let me drink!

630
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,210
It's better if I die from this!
It's better for you guys too!

631
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:54,290
Sheng!

632
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:56,380
Sheng!

633
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,170
Sheng!

634
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:08,940
Sheng!

635
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:11,170
Sheng!

636
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:18,330
Something cropped up in my family.
I had nowhere to go.

637
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:20,500
Ming Sheng allowed me
to stay here for a few days.

638
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:25,330
Oh, I just wanted to have a seat here.

639
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:26,380
Nothing good will happen

640
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:27,610
with you two in my life!

641
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:35,540
Don't worry.

642
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,250
I'll keep your secrets for you.

643
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:40,730
I've always been
worried about you ever since

644
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:42,380
we parted ways at Nanqiao Village.

645
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:44,610
Until yesterday,

646
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:47,460
I saw you on TV.

647
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,980
Your mother was looking for you.

648
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:52,060
I didn't expect this

649
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,580
to become such a huge commotion.

650
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:55,860
Maybe I did.

651
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:57,500
But now that it has happened,

652
00:39:57,730 --> 00:39:59,330
I don't know how to deal with it.

653
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:04,130
Although I'm older than you,

654
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:08,130
I'm truly impressed by your courage.

655
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,060
Will you regret it?

656
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:15,330
I won't.

657
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,500
If I get a second chance,

658
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,770
I'll still do the same thing
without hesitation.

659
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:23,940
Mumu, both of us
have to pull ourselves together.

660
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:28,020
I cannot.

661
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,650
I'm not as brave as you.

662
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:36,540
So, what do you plan to do next?

663
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:39,610
I'll leave Huanzhou.

664
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:43,170
Where will you go?

665
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:47,330
I'll head to Jiangzhou first.
I'll plan my next move after that.

666
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,020
Are you heading there yourself?

667
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:53,130
Sheng will join you too, right?

668
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:05,500
I grew up together with Sheng.

669
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:08,420
When his grandfather was still around,

670
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:10,940
he looked after me
as if I was his granddaughter.

671
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,980
He even gave me
a spare key to the house.

672
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,690
After that, his grandfather passed away.

673
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:18,250
Sheng never forgot
what his grandfather said.

674
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:22,210
He told me to treat this place
as my second home.

675
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:25,900
That's how he is.

676
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:28,860
That's why he takes such risks

677
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:30,290
just to hide you here.

678
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:34,770
He may look mischievous at school,

679
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:37,690
but he was the one who fed

680
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:40,020
all the stray dogs and cats nearby.

681
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:42,130
And, he's a boy.

682
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:44,250
All boys have a bit of a hero complex.

683
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:47,170
They like to show off in front of girls.

684
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:48,690
Maybe

685
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:52,730
he just likes to help out pitiful souls.

686
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:03,500
To be honest, I'm quite worried.

687
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:05,170
I'm worried

688
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:08,540
that he might hurt you
with his childish actions.

689
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,580
Not at all. He respects me.

690
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:17,290
That's not what I mean.

691
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:19,080
Sheng is very impulsive.

692
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,690
I'm worried that he might be
acting on impulse this time as well.

693
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:28,980
Actually, he was an obedient boy.

694
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:31,280
I think it's after
his grandfather's passing.

695
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,580
In addition, he has
a tense relationship with his father.

696
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:35,480
And, he was stressed out by his studies.

697
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,810
I think the issue of his studies abroad
has affected him too.

698
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:40,770
Maybe that's why he became rebellious.

699
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:44,130
Was he supposed
to attend a foreign university?

700
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:45,330
That's right.

701
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,250
His parents had reached
a consensus long ago

702
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:48,940
regarding his future.

703
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:50,810
He was supposed to study in France

704
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:52,810
and become an outstanding doctor.

705
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:55,040
You wouldn't guess it from

706
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,160
how often he fails at school.

707
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,810
He just didn't care about
the school exams.

708
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,580
But when it comes to language courses,

709
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:01,250
he's very serious about them.

710
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:03,420
If everything goes smoothly,

711
00:43:04,810 --> 00:43:06,130
he should settle down abroad.
