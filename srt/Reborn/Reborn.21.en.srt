00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,260
What did you wish for?

190
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:43,740
For my first wish,

191
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,180
I hope I can get
into the university I want.

192
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,390
Second wish,

193
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,400
I hope my whole family

194
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,310
stays healthy and safe.

195
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:52,700
And the third?

196
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:54,740
I can't tell you.

197
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:55,870
It's a secret.

198
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:59,390
Thank you, Ming Sheng.

199
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,030
Don't mention it.

200
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,700
I'm going to get
into Jiangzhou University!

201
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:13,310
Qiao Qingyu,

202
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:15,980
I'm glad I met you.

203
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:19,700
Me too!

204
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:25,260
Let's both do well, all right?

205
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,460
All the best to us both.

206
00:21:27,937 --> 00:21:28,527
Yeah.

207
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:31,630
(Every time I think about)

208
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:33,920
(how growing up means)

209
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,550
(I can shape my life
with my own efforts)

210
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:39,150
(and make my own choices,)

211
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:42,500
(I can't wait to grow up faster.)

212
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:44,310
(Qiao Qingyu.)

213
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:45,030
(Hm?)

214
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:46,700
(The sun's up.)

215
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:48,980
It's time.

216
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,070
Ming Sheng,

217
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,070
do you think

218
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,700
that once we grow up,

219
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:19,390
we'll meet so many people,

220
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,660
go through so many things,

221
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,700
that all these memories

222
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:27,550
we have now

223
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:31,030
will mean nothing?

224
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:47,870
Do you remember

225
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:49,180
the first time we met?

226
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:52,900
You bit me.

227
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,310
I bit you back.

228
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:58,220
Now we're even.

229
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,390
After this,
I'm going to delete all memories of you

230
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:06,660
with a single click.

231
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,310
I wish you all the best.

232
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:16,740
Hope you get
into the university you want.

233
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:25,660
Qingyu!

234
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,940
The noodle shop's in trouble! Go!

235
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:28,740
Hurry!

236
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:30,790
Oh, the poor family.

237
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:31,840
Look at them.

238
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,500
How do they expect
to do business like that?

239
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,030
Tastes worse than footbath water.

240
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,900
Listen to them. Filthy mouths.

241
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,700
Watch your language!

242
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,150
Get out. Spit outside.

243
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:05,110
Didn't your teacher teach you?

244
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,420
Protect the environment.

245
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:09,180
Keep the place clean.

246
00:25:12,062 --> 00:25:13,102
Thanks for your hard work.

247
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:15,590
Mr. Qiao.

248
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:17,870
Don't mind them.

249
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:19,790
Those boys don't know any better.

250
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:22,180
You keep coming back here.

251
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:24,310
We can't even do business anymore.

252
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:25,830
What more do you want from us?

253
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,550
Prospective mother-in-law.

254
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:34,900
Prospective father-in-law.

255
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:37,420
I've made mistakes, maybe.

256
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:40,150
But I'm really not that petty.

257
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:42,350
I'm here today for a good reason.

258
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:43,940
I swear.

259
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:45,030
Promise.

260
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:47,830
I came here today

261
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:50,180
to confess my feelings to Qingyu.

262
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:50,980
That's all.

263
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,030
Don't you dare try anything!

264
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,980
Our daughter's too young

265
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:56,740
for you.

266
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:57,700
Just leave.

267
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:58,830
Qingyu.

268
00:25:58,830 --> 00:25:59,720
What do you mean?

269
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,980
Where do you think you're going?

270
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:01,700
Stop!

271
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:04,220
Please don't do this!

272
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,220
What are you doing?

273
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:07,110
Did I tell you to use force?

274
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:07,870
Let go!

275
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,740
Did I tell you guys to do this?

276
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:14,830
Qingyu,

277
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,980
I'm just a man looking for love.

278
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,740
I'm not doing anything wrong.

279
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:20,870
Don't...

280
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:23,830
Got a problem?

281
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:25,940
No.

282
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,030
Qingyu.

283
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:30,500
Age isn't a problem.

284
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,390
If you choose me,

285
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,200
then all that time I spent in jail
wouldn't have been for nothing.

286
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,700
But if you don't choose me,

287
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,680
I'll have to bottle these feelings up.

288
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,830
They're too much, you know?

289
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,790
And I just might accidentally

290
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:42,390
blow up!

291
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:43,940
We'll call the police!

292
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:44,700
Stop!

293
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,220
Are you coming with me or not?

294
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,220
Let him go, and I'll go with you!

295
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,220
Come on, then.

296
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:51,700
Move it!

297
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:53,600
Don't touch her!

298
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,790
Are you coming with me or not?

299
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:55,220
Fine.

300
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:55,880
Let him go!

301
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,740
(Dangerous Stunts. Do Not Attempt.)
Let him go!

302
00:26:58,900 --> 00:26:59,460
Let him go!

303
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,310
Let's get out of here!

304
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,870
Who do you think you're scaring?

305
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:05,310
Try me!

306
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,180
Danger! Get out of here!

307
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,180
You've got issues!

308
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:23,940
- Mom!
- Mom!

309
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:26,030
- Mom!
- Mom!

310
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:27,660
Mom!

311
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:30,940
Mom? Mom!

312
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:03,070
Mom?

313
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,550
What are you doing here, Mom?

314
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,550
Qingyu.

315
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:12,740
I'm fine.

316
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:17,740
I think I dropped something.

317
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:21,030
Go back to your room.

318
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,040
I'll stay here alone for a while.

319
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,180
I'll head inside in a bit.

320
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:54,260
Mom.

321
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:58,110
Mom, what's wrong?

322
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:01,150
Does it hurt somewhere?

323
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:03,390
Tell us what's wrong.

324
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:05,030
Don't just keep it to yourself.

325
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,870
Mom. Mom?

326
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:13,220
The rooftop door was open.

327
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,420
You weren't home.

328
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:16,830
I thought...

329
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:19,310
Say something, Mom.

330
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,070
Qingyu.

331
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:35,070
Time flies.

332
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,070
You grew up so fast.

333
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:43,940
When you were born,

334
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,740
you only weighed about 2.1 kilograms.

335
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:49,700
You were as tiny as a kitten.

336
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:52,420
You had tiny fingers.

337
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,460
Tiny toes.

338
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,630
I was so careful when I held you.

339
00:29:58,150 --> 00:29:59,830
I was scared I'd break you.

340
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,220
Your sister was different.

341
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:08,790
When she was born,

342
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:11,030
her head was so round.

343
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,110
It wasn't deformed at all.

344
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:16,740
Her cries were so loud and bright.

345
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:19,830
People thought she was a big baby.

346
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:29,660
You're both my kids,

347
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,900
but how are your personalities
so different?

348
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:37,030
Your sister always looked so tough,

349
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,350
so carefree,

350
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:41,310
she had no tricks up her sleeve.

351
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:44,030
You, though?

352
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,350
You were quiet since you were little,

353
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,830
never said much,

354
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:53,030
but you always had your own mind.

355
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,900
Ever since we moved to Huanzhou,

356
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:01,870
the family has gone through a lot.

357
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:04,350
It's been even harder for you.

358
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:07,390
New school environment,

359
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:10,030
but your grades didn't drop.

360
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:13,030
So much pressure,
yet you kept improving.

361
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:20,870
I see all of that.

362
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:25,260
You're a good kid.

363
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,940
I just don't know why I always feel

364
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:32,110
the need to keep talking at you.

365
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:35,660
No, Mom. You don't talk too much.

366
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:36,940
I...

367
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:41,590
Every time I see how careful and timid

368
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:45,260
you are around me,

369
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,110
it breaks my heart.

370
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:48,980
No...

371
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,030
But I just can't

372
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:54,030
stop nagging, lecturing...

373
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:55,900
I'm scared.

374
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:56,830
I'm scared...

375
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:00,630
Qingyu...

376
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:03,180
I'm so scared...

377
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:05,940
What are you going on about, Mom?

378
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,310
Your sister...

379
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:16,740
Mom...

380
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:22,550
I wasn't with her...

381
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:26,180
My poor girl went through so much...

382
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:28,660
In the end...

383
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:30,740
She...

384
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:35,180
She's gone, but they still

385
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:38,030
point fingers at her. They still talked.

386
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:40,420
She was just a child.

387
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:44,830
What child doesn't make mistakes?

388
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:48,390
If anyone was at fault,
it was me and her father...

389
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,350
I regret it.

390
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:55,740
I regret

391
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:58,830
not letting her stay

392
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:02,260
when she came to Shunyun looking for us.

393
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,660
It was like I was possessed.

394
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,420
She wanted to stay,

395
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:09,940
but somehow, I forced her to go back.

396
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:21,310
I don't even know why...

397
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:22,870
I...

398
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:24,980
I'm her mother...

399
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,740
How could I do that?

400
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:30,550
She was crying out for help to me...

401
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,900
Qingyu...

402
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:44,310
I killed her...

403
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:48,390
Mom...

404
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:53,790
I can't let it happen to you too.

405
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:57,870
I don't want you to live
the way your father and I did.

406
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,070
I...

407
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,870
Did I hurt you, Qingyu?

408
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,560
I don't want to hurt you...

409
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,260
You're not, Mom...

410
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,460
I don't want to hurt you...

411
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:08,990
Mom, calm down...

412
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:10,910
I don't want to hurt you...

413
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:13,550
I don't want you to turn out like us...

414
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:15,030
I just want you to have a good life.

415
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:17,070
I never meant to hurt you...

416
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:17,860
Mom...

417
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:19,220
Did I hurt you, Qing?

418
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,220
No!

419
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:24,430
You said it yourself, Mom.

420
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:27,180
Yu and I are going to college.

421
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:28,340
We'll find jobs,

422
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:30,300
get married, and have kids.

423
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,220
We'll take care of you.

424
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,590
You're going to live a good life too.

425
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:36,340
Why are you rambling?

426
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:42,150
Mom...

427
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,110
Doctor,

428
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,780
I'm here to get another prescription
of sleeping pills for my mom.

429
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:14,180
How has she been lately?

430
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,070
Still having trouble sleeping?

431
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:19,260
Most nights, she can only sleep a little
with the pills.

432
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:23,070
We can adjust the dosage a little.

433
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:24,550
But to be safe,

434
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,820
I still suggest
she come in for a visit herself.

435
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,300
I've told her many times.

436
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,740
She just won't come.

437
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:31,380
Any other symptoms?

438
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,780
Her emotions are unstable.

439
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:38,550
She zones out a lot

440
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:39,990
and cries when she's alone.

441
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:42,550
When you talk to her,

442
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,630
it's like she can't even hear you.

443
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:46,950
She used to be someone

444
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:48,470
who was full of drive and energy.

445
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:52,300
Now it's like she's lost all motivation.

446
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,470
More than once,

447
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:56,990
I've seen her just standing

448
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:58,630
on the rooftop alone, in a daze.

449
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,510
Have you noticed

450
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:01,260
any signs of suicidal thoughts

451
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,070
or self-harm?

452
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:06,550
Suicide?

453
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,300
(Based on what you've described,)

454
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,430
(your mother's depression)

455
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,520
(has likely worsened.)

456
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,180
(I strongly recommend she seek
medical treatment as soon as possible.)

457
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:28,400
(If necessary,
hospitalization might be needed.)

458
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,510
(Given her current state,)

459
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:32,150
(there's a very high risk of suicide.)

460
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:38,340
(As a family member,)

461
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:39,550
(please stay alert.)

462
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:40,950
(Otherwise, with her condition,)

463
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:43,470
(her life may be in danger
at any moment.)

464
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,110
Qingyu!

465
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:23,220
Hurry up!

466
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:25,590
Sit tight.

467
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:36,380
Great!

468
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:38,860
I need some water.

469
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:40,300
All right. Let's play four-on-four.

470
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:41,740
Same teams.

471
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:43,470
Tip-off.

472
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:44,740
Tip-off! Game on!

473
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:48,550
Did you hear?

474
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:50,150
It's Qiao Qingyu from Class 5.

475
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:51,630
Her family's in trouble again.

476
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:53,150
The whole school knows by now.

477
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:55,560
I heard the craziest part is her dad.

478
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,300
Yesterday,
he almost blew up the noodle shop

479
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:59,260
with a gas tank!

480
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:14,380
Qingyu.

481
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:15,860
I'm being real with you today.

482
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:16,780
I came alone.

483
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:18,300
I'll buy you boba.

484
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:21,150
Or if you don't like that,

485
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:22,030
seafood, hot pot,

486
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,150
anything you want.

487
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:24,820
Your sister used to love those.

488
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,740
You know why your sister

489
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:28,260
was so famous back then?

490
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:29,660
It was all because of me.

491
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:31,700
I posted

492
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,860
her best photos online.

493
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:36,220
That's how she got
the title of "Shunyun's No. 1 Beauty."

494
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,470
I'm the real mastermind behind it all.

495
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:40,260
She was my creation.

496
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:43,470
And how did she repay me?

497
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:45,380
She played with my feelings.

498
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,910
But justice was served!

499
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:50,070
Guess what I discovered at the hospital?

500
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:52,220
She had HIV.

501
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:00,510
The deeper I loved her,

502
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,990
the more I hated her.

503
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:04,950
So I leaked

504
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:06,380
the news online.

505
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,260
It blew up!

506
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:10,110
Everyone was talking about her.

507
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:13,590
"Shunyun's No. 1 Beauty has a disease."

508
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:16,180
Her photos were everywhere.

509
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:17,950
Comments flooded in.

510
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,510
They were all about your sister.

511
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:21,590
It was better than a movie.

512
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:24,470
Qiao Beiyu was sick.

513
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,660
And you're the one who killed her.

514
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,780
You think I wanted to harass you?

515
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,150
You're the one who clung to me.
Don't you get that?

516
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:32,590
Do you know how long it took me

517
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:33,520
to forget all that pain?

518
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,760
She wouldn't have taken her life

519
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,040
if you hadn't posted it online!

520
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:37,430
What's it got to do with me?

521
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:39,260
It's not my fault!

522
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:42,820
You posted it, didn't you?

523
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:44,160
Didn't you?

524
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,040
If it weren't you,
would she have killed herself?

525
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,080
You took advantage of her!

526
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:47,910
How dare you!

527
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:49,220
You ruined our family!

528
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,780
You're the murderer!

529
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:52,220
Hei! Hei!

530
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:53,030
It's all your fault!

531
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:53,590
Hei!

532
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:54,550
Calm down, Hei.

533
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:55,240
Enough!

534
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:55,910
What happened?

535
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:01,630
Are you okay?

536
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,590
He killed Beiyu.

537
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:06,150
What?

538
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:08,070
He murdered her.

539
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:15,550
Something you should know, Hei.

540
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,550
She's dead.

541
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:19,430
They say she jumped into the sea.

542
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:22,340
Who are you even talking about?

543
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,380
Qiao Beiyu.

544
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:24,180
Who?

545
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,110
Qiao Beiyu.

546
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,860
I didn't expect Hei to be the one

547
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:59,180
who drove her sister to death.

548
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:02,700
He killed her sister,
and still won't leave her alone.

549
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,990
And the timing of it all.
The NCEE's just around the corner.

550
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:11,220
Sheng.

551
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:12,220
Don't overthink it.

552
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:13,880
There's nothing between you and her.

553
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,660
What happens to her has nothing to do
with you.

554
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:16,780
Yeah.

555
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:22,180
Sheng.

556
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:24,740
You're going to Beining soon
for your exams.

557
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:25,550
Yeah.

558
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:26,780
Got everything packed?

559
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,110
What time's your flight?

560
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:31,110
Bring me back

561
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:33,110
two pairs of sneakers from Beining,

562
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:33,820
yeah?

563
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:36,950
