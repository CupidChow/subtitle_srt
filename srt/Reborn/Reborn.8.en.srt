at school.

Mrs. Qiao.

I apologize
for the trouble caused, Mr. Sun.

54
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:54,960
Please calm down.

55
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,030
Let me introduce.

56
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,080
This is Qiao Qingyu's mother.

57
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,110
You're here, Mr. Ming.

58
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,430
Mr. Sun. Director.

Do you two know each other?

No, we don't.

You're Qiao Qingyu's mother?

62
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,470
I'm Ming Sheng's father.

63
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:16,400
Nice to meet you.

64
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:19,910
What happened?

65
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,880
I believe Mr. Sun already explained
the situation to you both.

66
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,230
Mrs. Qiao.

67
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,400
The incident at the school gate

68
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,550
is still under investigation.

69
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,550
The group of delinquents involved
have been taken to the police station.

70
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,280
It has caused a very negative impact.

71
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:36,230
Qiao Qingyu has an older sister,
correct?

72
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:38,200
We have heard about that as well.

73
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,790
The school sympathizes
with what your family has gone through.

74
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,880
But the incident today
still reflects poorly on us.

75
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,960
So,

76
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,350
please talk to Qingyu when you get home.

77
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:51,160
Have her reflect on her actions
over the next few days and stay home.

78
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,280
Sir, I apologize on her behalf.

79
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,230
She's still a child.
She doesn't know any better.

80
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,990
As her mother,
I didn't raise her well enough.

81
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,350
I know she was wrong.

82
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:00,790
I apologize to you,

83
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:03,670
to her teachers,
and to everyone at the school.

84
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,590
But she is a good kid
who loves studying.

85
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:07,230
You have to let her stay in school.

86
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:09,200
Can't you give her another chance?

87
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:15,840
My injury had nothing to do
with Qiao Qingyu.

88
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,670
I accidentally cut my hand

89
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,350
when I borrowed her cutter.

90
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:22,110
It was all just a misunderstanding.

91
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,720
Ming Sheng.

92
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,910
That is a bold claim to make.

93
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:26,840
Others are saying something else.

94
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,430
Sir, I'm not making anything up.

95
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,640
And I was directly involved.

96
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,910
So I know exactly

97
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,280
how it happened.

98
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:33,990
You...

99
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:37,550
Sir, those troublemakers

100
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:39,160
have already been detained

101
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,670
for causing a public disturbance.

102
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:43,400
The ringleader will be held for a while.

103
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,840
They all have criminal records.

104
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,350
They regularly harass girls.

105
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:49,670
Qiao Qingyu was a victim, too.

106
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,230
We can't punish the victim

107
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,230
just because of the actions

108
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,430
of a few thugs.

109
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,790
If word got out,

110
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,640
people would say

111
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,110
our school can't tell right from wrong.

112
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:00,910
Sir,

113
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:04,110
Qiao Qingyu had nothing to do
with Ming Sheng's injury

114
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:05,910
and the whole incident.

115
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:06,590
There's no reason

116
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:08,350
for the school to punish her.

117
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:10,590
I have heard

118
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,350
some rumors

119
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:15,030
about Qiao Qingyu's sister.

120
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:16,910
As a medical professional,

121
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:18,720
I urge the school

122
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:21,110
to improve education on these matters.

123
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,790
So that ignorance does not cause

124
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:25,230
unnecessary fear or stigma.

125
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:27,110
Right.

126
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,470
All right, Mrs. Qiao.

127
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:31,400
We'll stay in touch.

128
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:35,520
Qingyu, you really need

129
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,590
to learn from this.

130
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,320
If something like this
ever happens again,

131
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,590
tell a teacher or a parent

132
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:40,520
right away.

133
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:42,760
Don't just charge in
on your own like that.

134
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:44,760
You're still a minor.

135
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,670
It's our job as adults to protect you.

136
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,470
Do you understand?

137
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,790
So the school is not punishing me?

138
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,400
Ming Sheng already explained everything.

139
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,880
It was just an accident.

140
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,990
The school has no reason to punish you.

141
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:01,080
Mr. Sun, we'll head home now.

142
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,320
All right. Take care on the way.

143
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,320
Mrs. Qiao, please go easy on her.

144
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,760
Go home with your mother.

145
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,790
All you do is humiliate us!

146
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:37,880
Why did you help Qiao Qingyu

147
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,830
at school today?

148
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:41,520
Didn't you want to help her?

149
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,760
She's your friend.

150
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,190
I figured she couldn't be all that bad.

151
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:49,400
Be careful not to get your wound wet.

152
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,120
Stay home for the next couple of days.

153
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,070
Stay here.

154
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,120
I can take care of you.

(Incoming call: Fang Yanqiu)

156
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,550
Why won't you answer your phone?

157
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,160
Am I interrupting?

158
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,830
No, it's nothing important.

159
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:15,910

Anything's fine.

163

Qingyu,

164
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:44,910
I think Mom's chopping you up

165
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:47,830
like dumpling filling over there.

166
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,670
Come on, tell me.

167
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,880
Were you really planning
to stab that punk

168
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,950
with the cutter?

169
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,030
You're so cool.

170
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,480
You're a real hero.

171
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,710
I heard
you accidentally hurt Ming Sheng too.

172
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,310
He's usually so tough,
but he didn't come after you.

173
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,310
Did he hit his head or something?

174
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:26,240
(It's okay.)

175
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,670

176
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,550
Ming Sheng.

177

Ming Sheng.

178
00:10:58,910 --> 00:10:59,600
Dinner's ready.

179
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:13,520
Hello?

180
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:16,030
Is this Dr. Ming?

181
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,120
He's cooking.

182
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,830
Oh, it's you, Ming Sheng.

183
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,190
This is Ms. Zhang
from the neighborhood committee.

184
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:23,030
Your dad mentioned he wanted to donate

185
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:25,160
some sheet music
to the community center.

186
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,190
I was wondering
if he has sorted them out yet?

187
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:27,880
Sheet music?

188
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,120
What's the meaning of this?

189
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:47,950
Your mom told me

190
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,480
she didn't need those anymore

191
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,880
and asked me to take care of them.

192
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:53,120
I get it.

193
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,240
Just trying
to clear out some space, right?

194
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,600
Don't worry.

195
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:58,670
Mom and I won't get in your way.

196
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:00,910
Ming Sheng.

197
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:06,520
Ming Sheng.

198
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:08,760
Ming Sheng!

199
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:12,160
It's the middle of the night.
Why are you still up?

200
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:14,670
We gave them the wrong names.

201
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Huh?

202
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,950
We have to change Qing's name.

203
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:20,640
Why?

204
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,600
I asked around.

205
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,830
Qiao Beiyu. Qiao Qingyu.

206
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,430
It's unlucky to give girls
the "Yu" character.

207
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,790
They'll be hard to raise.

208
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:32,880
We already lost Bei.

209
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,430
I'm scared we'll lose Qing too...

210
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:36,910
Nonsense!

211
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,710
Stop making trouble where there is none.

212
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,920
You think you own the police station
or something?

213
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,720
You can change things
just because you say so?

214
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:45,400
Go to bed.

215
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:06,430
Something happened
with Ming Sheng at school yesterday.

216
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,000
I really couldn't get away.

217
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,030
I'm very sorry.

218
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,160
You already explained everything
on the phone yesterday.

219
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:12,880
I understand.

220
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,600
Of course, your son comes first.

221
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,760
That's not what I meant.

222
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,600
How about dinner tonight

223
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:27,600
with your parents?

224
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,120
They have already gone back to our hometown.

225
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,480
We'll talk about it another time.

226
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,160
Yanqiu.

227
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:42,400
I...

228
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:42,880
Yanqiu.

229
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,240
The nursing department needs you.

230
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,430
Coming.

231
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,600
Everyone,

232
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,030
finish these problems
before the teacher gets here.

233
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,560
Just thinking about those arrogant jerks

234
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,920
from No.1 High School makes me mad.

235
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,480
If Ming Sheng hadn't missed the game,

236
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,640
we wouldn't have lost to them.

237
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,480
Drop it. We had issues too.

238
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,070
What?

239
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,830
Look at his hand.

240
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:15,400
It looks serious.

241
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,790
Will it leave lasting damage?

242
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,550
Qiao Qingyu.

243
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,480
Ming Sheng wouldn't have hurt his hand
if it weren't for you.

244
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,480
And we would have won.

245
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,030
Apologize to Ming Sheng.

246
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:35,760
Do it!

247
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,280
Is it that hard to say sorry?

248
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,950
Or do you still think
you did nothing wrong?

249
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,240
Just apologize.

250
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,280
It was your fault.

251
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:55,430
Give it a rest.

252
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,640
Whether Qiao Qingyu apologizes or not

253
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,120
is between the two of us.

254
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,910
Stay out of this.

255
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,520
Quiet!

256
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,000
It's self-study time.

257
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:05,760
Got it.

258
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,600
Are you okay?

259
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:39,910
Did you see who did it?

260
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,910
That was so messed up.

261
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:42,950
I didn't,

262
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:43,950
but I know who did it.

263
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:50,310
Did you see Qiao Qingyu's face?

264
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,550
Wish I could've gotten it on camera.

265
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,280
Do you think she knows it was us?

266
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,910
What is she going to do? Tell on us?

267
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,310
She has no proof.

268
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,510
Qingyu,

269
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,320
did they give you any more trouble?

270
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:28,910
No.

271
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:31,910
The head of the discipline
already talked to them.

272
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,400
They apologized to me too.

273
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,120
Thanks.

274
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:38,800
No problem.

275
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:49,840
Here.

276
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,120

is the reason I'm in this state?

Huh?

345
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,320
Sorry.

346
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,840
That came out of nowhere.

347
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:12,640

349
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:17,920

350
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,190
If it weren't for you,
I would have made a huge mistake.

351
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,160
I'm sorry you got hurt because of me.

352
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,160
Just a "sorry" and that's it?

353
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:33,950

354
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,640

Huh?

358
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,190
I just wanted to help you tidy up.

359
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:12,309
I didn't mean to touch that.

360
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,090
That doesn't mean
you can go through my things.

361

You don't owe me anything anymore.

362
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:17,510
Leave.

00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,040
Niao Mingkai.

374
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,560
I kept forgetting to bring it to you.

375
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:52,840
Meet me by the big tree after school.

376
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,430
If you don't show up,

377
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,400
I'll assume you don't want it anymore.

378
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:57,430
I'll get rid of it.

379
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:58,270
It's up to you.

380
00:25:58,270 --> 00:25:58,510
Sheng.

381
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:01,040
Hurry up. We're free to do what we want
after we finish the laps.

382
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:01,560
Come on.

383
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,910
Don't stand me up!

384
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:25,510
Come on up.

385
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,320
Don't you want your letter?

386
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:37,750
My letter?

387
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,160
Close your eyes.

388
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:42,670
Why?

389
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,640
Just do it.

390
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,320
What next?

391
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:53,230
Did you hear that sound?

392
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:07,230
Actually, this tree can talk.

393
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,600
It's saying,

394
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:16,800
"I'm sorry."

395
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,640
You're messing with me.

396
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:23,800
I'm not.

397
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,750
I shouldn't have
snapped at you yesterday.

398
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:30,800
I'm sorry.

399
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:37,040
Those records and albums

400
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,160
were my mom's.

401
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,360
This place used to be

402
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,360
our secret hideout.

403
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:46,470
Want to hear my story?

404
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,160
My parents divorced

405
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,040
when I was really young.

406
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:04,230
I was raised by my grandfather.

407
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,840
The summer
before the high school entrance exam,

408
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:09,510
my grandpa passed away too.

409
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,710
After that,

410
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,600
I became nothing but a burden.

411
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,990
That's why I always felt like

412
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,510
my whole existence was a mistake.

413
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:26,800
So you see, Qiao Qingyu,

414
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,880
you're not the only one with a weakness.

415
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:36,360
Why are you telling me all this?

416
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,560
I just felt like it.

417
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:45,950
Ming Sheng.

418
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:46,750
Hm?

419
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,400
You're not that bad.

420
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:25,950
I'm home.

421
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,080
Oh.

422
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:30,710
Me too.

423
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,080
Well, I'm going up now.

424
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:33,670
Mm.

425
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:36,320
Qiao Qingyu.

426
00:29:44,152 --> 00:29:44,942
Your letter.

427
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,120
I finally remembered to bring it.

428
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,360
(To: Qiao Qingyu, From: Niao Mingkai)

429
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,910
Will you write back to him?

430
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,510
Don't get the wrong idea.

431
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:58,990
Final exams are coming up.

432
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,750
Wouldn't want you getting distracted.

433
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,160
I'm going home.

434
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:09,270
I'm not going to write him back.

435
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,670
Qingyu.

436
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:40,360
You should've knocked, Mom.

437
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,750
Oh, I forgot about that.

438
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,400
Skip school tomorrow.

439
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,430
I got you a day off.

440
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,510
Come with me to take care of something.

441
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:48,230
What is it?

442
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,880
You'll know tomorrow.

443
00:31:00,311 --> 00:31:04,690
(Huanzhou Bus Station)

444
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,040
Come on.

445
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:08,230
Where are we going?

446
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,750
We're going back to our hometown
to change your name.

447
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,470
Why?

448
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:13,640
People are saying

449
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,320
the names Qingyu and Beiyu are unlucky.

450
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,230
We need to change them.

451
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,000
I don't want you
ending up like your sister.

452
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,440
Change it,

453
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,840
and you won't have any more trouble.

454
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,510
I'm not going!

455
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:20,880
Qingyu...

456
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,120
I don't want to change my name!

457
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,230
You don't get a say in this!

458
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:24,750
I'm not going! I don't want to!

459
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:25,640
Behave!

460
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,950
I don't want to go!

461
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:28,080
Look!

462
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,480
We can talk about this, ma'am.

463
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,640
She's my daughter! Let me go!

464
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,360
She's my daughter!

465
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,320
Please let go of her.

466
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,080
She's my daughter!

467
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:33,720
Let go.

468
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,560
What are you doing?

469
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,360
Be civil.

470
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,560
She kept dragging that girl along.

471
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:39,910
I could tell
the girl didn't want to go with her.

472
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,270
My name is Li Fanghao.

473
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,750
She's Qiao Qingyu.

474
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:43,440
She's my daughter.

475
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:45,480
I was just trying to take her back
to her hometown.

476
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,750
Is she your mother, Miss?

477
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:49,560
She's ignoring you.

478
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,800
She doesn't want to talk to you.

479
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,920
What's up with this old woman?

480
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,990
Qiao Qingyu, say something!

481
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:54,560
Why are you hiding your face
with a mask?

482
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:55,440
Ashamed to be seen?

483
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:55,950
That's right.

484
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:57,670
I think she might be a human trafficker.

485
00:31:57,670 --> 00:31:58,670
I'm not a trafficker!

486
00:31:58,670 --> 00:31:59,600
Qiao Qingyu!

487
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:00,880
Then why won't she talk to you?

488
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,190
What do you think you're doing?

489
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,510
Qingyu!

490
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:06,040
Explain yourself.

491
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,160
She doesn't even want
to bother with you.

492
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,480
Don't you dare try anything!

493
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,840
Explain yourself, woman.

494
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:14,950
Explain yourself first!

495
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:15,950
Qiao Qingyu!

496
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,240
Qiao Qingyu.

497
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:41,970
What was that back there?

498
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:45,560
I asked you a question.

499
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,650
What were you thinking?

500
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:51,520
Did you think
once the police took me away,

501
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,250
you'd be free?

502
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:52,970
That's enough.

503
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:53,370
Answer me!

504
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:54,240
All right, all right.

505
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,560
She knows what she did wrong.

506
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:57,080
Come on. Apologize to your mother.

507
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,130
Say you won't do it again.

508
00:32:58,130 --> 00:32:59,690
I won't apologize.
I did nothing wrong.

509
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:01,130
Qiao Qingyu, you listen to me.

510
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:03,040
As long as I'm alive,
you'll do as I say.

511
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:04,080
I'm your mother.

512
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:05,080
Enough.

513
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:06,610
There's a knife in the kitchen.

514
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:07,570
Go on. Stab me.

515
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:09,090
Kill me, and you can do what you want.

516
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:10,250
You'll be free once I'm dead!

517
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:11,290
You disrespected me first.

518
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,280
You...

519
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:14,530
Qiao Qingyu!

520
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:15,810
Calm down. Let's talk about this.

521
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:17,210
Your father and I worked tirelessly

522
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:18,040
to send you to school!

523
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:18,370
Get out!

524
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:19,450
Don't come back if you dare.

525
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,450
You think I owe you respect?

526
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:22,280
Enough. Calm down.

527
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:22,810
That's enough!

528
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:23,850
She can do this to me today.

529
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:25,210
She can do the same to you tomorrow!

530
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:26,760
Just talk to her.
You shouldn't force her.

531
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,720
You're all defending her!

532
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,410
You...

533
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,450
She has a point.

534
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:34,210
Look.

535
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,040
You should respect her wishes too.

536
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:37,370
She's not a child anymore.

537
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,890
Can't you just ease up a little?

538
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,410
Qiao Lusheng,

539
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:41,930
how many times did you ever step up

540
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,450
as a father?

541
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,930
Were you ever even there for them?

542
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:50,890
Because you never took responsibility.

543
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:52,690
Because you always
passed everything to me.

544
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:53,810
I had to take on everything.

545
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:00,930
Beiyu...

546
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:02,450
I couldn't raise Beiyu by myself.

547
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:04,520
Her grandparents did,
but they didn't care about her.

548
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:07,170
And every time I saw her,
I couldn't bring myself to discipline her.

549
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:10,290
And look how that turned out.

550
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:15,050
I can't just stand by

551
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:16,410
and let Qingyu turn out the same.

552
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:26,930
This is about the kids.

553
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:28,640
Why are you suddenly blaming my parents?

554
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:31,850
It's not like
they didn't raise the child.

555
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:33,480
They tried their best.

556
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,850
They brought her up.

557
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:38,810
Qiao Lusheng!

558
00:34:39,890 --> 00:34:43,000
Did I ask them to raise my child?

559
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,890
They took her from me!

560
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,730
You were in on it too!

561
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:55,640
All for your pride, your image,

562
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,850
your vanity.

563
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:59,160
I never should've listened to you.

564
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:03,850
I should've taken Beiyu
and disappeared far, far away...

565
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:27,080
Take it.

566
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:36,080
Getting a name change
isn't the worst idea.

567
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:39,770
Might as well pick something

568
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:42,810
that sounds nicer.

569
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:44,450
We can both change our names.

570
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:46,050
Something in the same vein.

571
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:47,330
That way, people will still know

572
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:48,890
we're siblings when they hear our names.

573
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,730
Students.

574
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:08,930
Some students

575
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:11,250
did not attend

576
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:13,000
yesterday's anti-bullying seminar

577
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,040
organized by the school.

578
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,560
I've marked that down.

579
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,370
Come explain yourselves
after the meeting.

580
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:19,330
Class Representative,

581
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:20,690
please hand out the winter homework

582
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:21,600
and report cards later.

583
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,090
I won't nag here,

584
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:25,080
but make sure you finish
your homework on time.

585
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,810
And be safe
if you're going out over break.

586
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,600
Have a good winter break.

587
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,850
You're on winter break now?

588
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,250
Sorry.

589
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:35,770
It's because
I went asking around about Hei

590
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:37,040
that he came after you.

591
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:39,410
It wasn't your fault.

592
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:41,010
I was the one who chose to look for him.

593
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:42,810
And it's already over.

594
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,930
Was he the one you were looking for?

595
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,250
After Beiyu dropped out,

596
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:58,970
your parents came to pack her things.

597
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:00,600
They went through everything.

598
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,080
But Beiyu was good at hiding.

599
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,250
They didn't find anything.

600
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,040
I think

601
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:08,600
you might find a clue in this.

602
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:30,770
(Report of HIV Antibody
Confirmatory Testing)

603
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:32,010
(I loved him. He was my first.)

604
00:38:41,219 --> 00:38:43,699
(China is experiencing
its worst cold wave in a century.)

605
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:45,250
(Since mid-last month,)

606
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:47,560
(heavy snow has hit central
and eastern mountain regions,)

607
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:49,810
(with widespread freezing conditions.)

608
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:52,290
(Multiple highways across the province
have been shut down,)

609
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,520
(and transportation
has been severely affected.)

610
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,810
(Experts predict)

611
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:58,600
(the cold wave will continue
through the Chinese New Year.)

612
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:15,040
Qingyu, Mom gave you this.

613
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:26,330
I'm not hungry too, Mom.

614
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:47,600
The bus is having
some mechanical issues.

615
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,730
I'll get out and take a look.

616
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,040
Can you fix it?

617
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:53,160
Don't rush me. I'll check.

618
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:03,410
The bus broke down.
It'll take about an hour to fix.

619
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:04,890
There are roughly ten li left ahead.

620
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:06,810
If you're in a hurry,
you can start walking.

621
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:07,640
Give us a refund.

622
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:08,330
No refunds.

623
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,200
What if he can't fix the bus?

624
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:19,410
He said

625
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:20,810
it'll be fixed in an hour.

626
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:23,080
It's almost ten li back from here.

627
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:24,370
How long would that take on foot?

628
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:26,040
We'd freeze to death.

629
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:28,480
We have all these things with us too.

630
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:44,610
I think I'll have

631
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:45,770
that tea egg after all, Mom.

632
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:47,730
I'm feeling a little hungry now.

633
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,730
Save one for your sister.

634
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,450
She doesn't want it.

635
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:10,000
Dad! Mom!

636
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,330
We're back.

637
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:12,160
Dad.

638
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,160
You're finally back, Lusheng.
We were worried about you.

639
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,770
The bus broke down on the way,

640
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:17,810
so we were delayed a bit.

641
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:20,640
You must be freezing, Yu.

642
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,560
Is the ginger soup ready?

643
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:23,680
Yes.

644
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:25,000
I bought this for you.

645
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,290
Just leave it on the table.

646
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:27,200
Here's the ginger soup.

647
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,290
You're all back.

648
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:29,810
I'll get some rest, then.

649
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:31,290
Yes, of course. Get some rest.

650
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:33,330
- It's terribly cold.
- Come on.

651
00:41:33,370 --> 00:41:34,330
Have some ginger soup.

652
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:36,160
Drink up.

653
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,040
I'll do it, Mom.

654
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:38,730
Hurry.

655
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:39,640
Yanfen.

656
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:41,970
How's Jinrui's wedding coming along?

657
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:43,770
They've already registered
their marriage.

658
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:46,080
Good, good.

659
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:46,770
Thanks, Grandma.

660
00:41:46,930 --> 00:41:48,600
I'm cold too, Grandma.

661
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:50,000
You have hands, don't you?

662
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:51,810
My daughter-in-law isn't going anywhere.

663
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:54,250
She's beautiful,

664
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:56,930
well-educated,

665
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,560
and an only child too.

666
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,810
She'll be able to support Jinrui.

667
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:03,330
Also,

668
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:06,080
they're city folks
and didn't ask for a dowry.

669
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:08,970
She's perfect in every way.

670
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:09,560
That's good.

671
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,290
For Jinrui to marry Xiaoyun

672
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,080
is a blessing for our family.

673
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:15,120
That's good to hear.

674
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:17,890
You make it sound like
we're the ones marrying up.

675
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:21,560
My grandson was the county's
top scorer on the NCEE.

676
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,290
Forget one Xiaoyun.

677
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,810
He can marry ten of them

678
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,330
if he wants.

679
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:28,200
That's right.

680
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:32,810
The Secretary added Jinrui and Xiaoyun
into the family genealogy book

681
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,330
a few days ago.

682
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:35,680
These days,

683
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:38,040
it's Jinrui who's carrying

684
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,730
the reputation
of the entire Qiao family.

685
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,120
Grandma,

686
00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:44,850
when will Qingyu and I be added
to the genealogy?

687
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,160
Once you get married,

688
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,730
the Secretary will add your name in.

689
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:51,640
What about Qingyu?

690
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,450
She's a girl.

691
00:42:53,890 --> 00:42:55,520
She'll marry
into another family someday.

692
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:56,600
That's right.

693
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,640
I'll go put away my bags.

694
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:00,730
All right.

695
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,850
Sort your things out.

696
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:05,640
Have a seat, Lusheng.

697
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:06,250
Okay.

698
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:06,610
Sit down.

699
00:43:06,610 --> 00:43:07,290
You too, Yanfen.

700
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:07,690
All right.

701
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:08,810
I'd like some more, Grandma.

702
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:10,890
Eat up, Yu.

703
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:13,480
