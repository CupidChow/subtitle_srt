00:01:55,737 --> 00:01:56,922
I packed you cold medicine.

(999 Cold Remedy Granules)
Take care of yourself over there.

17
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,510
Leave some time for your layover.

18
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,520
Don't miss your flight.

19
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,640
After you land,

20
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,590
your mother will send someone
to pick you up.

21
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:08,280
I also activated

22
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,070
international roaming for your phone.

23
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,400
Call me if anything urgent comes up.

24
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,000
You've thought of everything.

25
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,750
You're really
in a hurry to get rid of me.

26
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,190
That's ridiculous.

27
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,240
You'll be in France
for winter break with your mom.

28
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,520
We agreed on this a long time ago.

29
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,120
That sounds nice and all.

30
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,560
Then, why didn't you
let me leave earlier?

31
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,070
Maybe it's because Grandpa passed away.

32
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,070
Someone here thinks
I'm just in the way now.

33
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,520
I'll take you to the airport.

34
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,120
No need. I'll take a taxi.

35
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:16,840
Qing, are you there?

36
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:21,750
Qing?

37
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:25,560
Jinrui.

38
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,870
I'm going to the post office
to pick up the wedding photos.

39
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:28,870
Care to tag along?

40
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,120
Come on, let's go.

41
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,680
You're too young
to stay cooped up at home.

42
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,630
Brooding is bad for you.

43
00:03:35,637 --> 00:03:35,985
Let's go.

(Nanqiao Village)

This car has been with us
for nearly ten years.

47
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,190
It's time for a new car.

48
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,230
Back when we just bought the car,

49
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,200
Bei hung this up.

50
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:22,230
Jinrui,

51
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:23,800
can you tell me

52
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,590
some stories from
when Qiao Beiyu was little?

53
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,590
It was such a long time ago.

54
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,720
I can hardly remember.

55
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,520
Every time I ask about Qiao Beiyu,

56
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,200
everyone in the family avoids it.

57
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,230
Other than you,
I really do not know who to ask.

58
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,350
Just tell me something.

59
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,960
Bei was brought back to Nanqiao Village

60
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,670
by Grandpa and Grandma when she was six.

61
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,320
The girl had to leave her parents.

62
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,840
She must have been scared.

63
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:53,990
I could really relate to that.

64
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:56,200
(But she did not throw a tantrum.)

65
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:59,230
(It felt like she already knew
it wouldn't help.)

66
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,960
(Even the adults believed)

67
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,840
(she was just good at adapting.)

68
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,350
(But what I saw)

69
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,990
(was her hiding and crying at night.)

70
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,990
Bei, why are you crying?

71
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:14,990
Are you alright?

72
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:17,550
I'm fine.

73
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,990
Let me show you something.

74
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:02,760
Bei, feeling better now?

75
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,400
Where did it go?

76
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,720
The ear, the ear.

77
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,230
There it is.

78
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,470
Grandpa's gonna throw it away now!

79
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:15,720
Get ready, it's going in.

80
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:17,960
(As the days went by,)

81
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,430
(Bei slowly got used
to life in Nanqiao Village.)

82
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:22,880
(But I knew)

83
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,840
(she still wished deep down)

84
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:26,550
(that she could live with you all.)

85
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:27,960
Look at those long arms and legs.

86
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,280
He is definitely made for sports.

87
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,670
No doubt about that.

88
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,320
Bei.

89
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:08,520
Bei!

90
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:10,670
Wait up.

91
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,280
Let's go home.

92
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,590
Everyone is waiting for you.

93
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:20,320
Grandma even made your favorite ribs.

94
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,790
She didn't make those for me.

95
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:23,670
She made them for Qingyu and Yu.

96
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:24,590
I don't even care.

97
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:27,880
What about the new clothes?

98
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,880
Aunt Fanghao bought you
a bunch of pretty outfits,

99
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,790
plus shoes and a new backpack.

100
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,200
Qiao Huan would be
so jealous if she saw them.

101
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,400
If you really don't want them,

102
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,470
I'll go tell Aunt Fanghao

103
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,960
to give them all to Qiao Huan.

104
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:43,160
Don't you dare!

105
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,200
Bei, you should talk to
Uncle Lusheng and Aunt Fanghao.

106
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,400
Have them take you back to Shunyun.

107
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,400
Aunt Fanghao is really easy to talk to.

108
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,200
Be sweet to her, say nice things.

109
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:58,880
They will definitely say yes.

110
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:01,200
Grandpa and Grandma say

111
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:03,230
if I go to Shunyun,

112
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:05,670
then Qing has to stay behind
in Nanqiao Village.

113
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,320
She is still little. She will cry a lot.

114
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,550
But you want to be with your parents.

115
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,590
It's okay. I have you.

116
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,640
(From that moment on, I promised myself)

117
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,990
(that I would always look out for Bei.)

118
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,400
(I would never let her get hurt.)

119
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,320
Not long after you were born,

120
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,990
Bei was brought back to Nanqiao Village.

121
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,400
You two didn't get
to spend much time together,

122
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,080
but to her,

123
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,480
she was already the older sister.

124
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,310
She felt like she had to
love and protect you.

125
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:43,240
Before I ever really got
the chance to know Qiao Beiyu,

126
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:44,670
she was already gone.

127
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,160
I'm just glad you were there
with her in Nanqiao Village.

128
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,030
Thank you, Jinrui.

129
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:54,400
I'm your big brother.

130
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,310
That is what I'm here for.

132
00:09:05,397 --> 00:09:06,351
Wait in the car.

133
00:09:06,428 --> 00:09:08,030
I'll take you around after this.

(Paris, France)

136
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:43,480
So, how was it?

137
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,830
Was the flight tiring?

138
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:45,910
Not too bad.

139
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,520
Your mom talks about you all the time.

140
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,190
My name is Guan Chengyu.

141
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:54,030
Your mom is a good friend of mine.

142
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,480
I'm also her manager.

143
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:57,950
Right now,

144
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,360
she's in the middle of preparing

145
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,710
for a music showcase.

146
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,400
She's been buried in work at the studio.

147
00:10:04,642 --> 00:10:05,400
It's just up ahead.

148
00:10:12,634 --> 00:10:14,480
The first time I met Anna,

149
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,160
she was playing this exact piece.

150
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,280
Back then, she had just moved to France.

151
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,480
She worked at a restaurant,

152
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,760
while chasing better prospects.

153
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,640
I was just some college kid

154
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,430
who knew nothing.

155
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,830
One time, during a break
from waiting tables,

156
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,670
she played this piece on a public piano

157
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,280
at a train station in France.

158
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,310
I happened to walk by.

159
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,360
Even someone who knows
nothing about music

160
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:41,480
would've been drawn in by her.

161
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:45,030
It wasn't about flawless technique.

162
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,120
It was the emotion she gave off.

163
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,480
It was the kind of feeling
that goes beyond race,

164
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,030
gender, or language.

165
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,240
See you next time.

166
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:02,910
Bye!

167
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:03,640
Bye!

168
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:04,000
Bye!

169
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,160
- Bye-bye!
- Bye-bye!

170
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:15,480
Oh my god.

171
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:15,950
Mom.

172
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,030
How was it? Was the flight tiring?

173
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:27,520
Not really.

174
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,880
You've shot up so much.

175
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,070
You're taller than me now.

176
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,000
I play basketball at school.

177
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:37,600
I grow fast.

178
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:41,310
Come on, take a look at the studio.
Come in.

179
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,600
Well? Want to play something?

180
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,000
I don't want to embarrass myself.

181
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:55,550
Jinrui.

182
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,400
A little to the left.

183
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,070
Left...

184
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,070
Alright.

185
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:00,520
A bit higher.

186
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,030
Too high now. Lower it.

187
00:12:03,954 --> 00:12:05,520
Jinyu, yours is too low.

188
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,480
Move it higher.

189
00:12:07,257 --> 00:12:09,600
(Wedding)
Okay. It looks good. Hang it up.

190
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,160
Your grandparents are unbelievable.

191
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,120
They have a brand new house,

192
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,360
but still insisted on holding
the banquet in the old place.

193
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,580
(Nanqiao High School, Class Hongzhi of 2001)
I even had to bring over Jinrui's stuff

194
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,890
just to make the room look decent.

195
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,840
Jinrui, are you also from
Nanqiao High School?

196
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,790
Did you know Qiao Beiyu's classmates?

197
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,000
Bei was in high school back then.

198
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,950
Our Jinrui was already off
at college in Huanzhou.

199
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,240
How would he know
any of her classmates?

200
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,400
Qing, come here.
Help me lay the bed sheet.

201
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,190
Which one do you think looks better?

202
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,400
(Fortune, Happiness)
That one feels more festive.

203
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,480
Alright.

204
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:57,790
Okay, let's hang it up.

205
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:03,830
Yanfen.

206
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,760
Looks like things are
finally looking up for you.

207
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,760
Time to enjoy some peace and quiet.

208
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,520
Oh please, that's not my kind of luck.

209
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,950
Once Jinrui has kids,

210
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:15,280
I'll have to go to the city
and help babysit them.

211
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,280
That's for sure.

212
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,550
A mother's work never really ends.

213
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:20,360
Come on, Yanfen, teach us

214
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,670
how you raised a son

215
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,070
as impressive as Jinrui.

216
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,240
Jinrui has never

217
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,640
given me any trouble.

218
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:29,400
His grandparents always said

219
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:31,830
Jinrui was sent to us
to bring us blessings.

220
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:32,760
And it feels that way.

221
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,400
Yanfen,

222
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,710
if you say that,

223
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:37,000
then you're being way too modest.

224
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,400
Everyone knows

225
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,240
the Qiao family is
well-known in the village

226
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:43,120
for being a model of good values
and strong character.

227
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,190
If it were the old days,

228
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,080
they'd put up arches
for you at the village gate.

229
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,910
Indeed.

230
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:49,520
If you ask me,

231
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,430
your family raise children
with the right values.

232
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,240
All the kids

233
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:54,070
turned out amazing.

234
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,070
It's just such a shame about Bei.

235
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,520
Not the best topic.

236
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,640
Yanfen, I just remembered.

237
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,710
That last time
the whole village got so lively,

238
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:10,640
wasn't it when Jinrui

239
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,550
got into college?

240
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,160
That's right.

241
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:12,880
Yeah, that was it.

242
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,910
Haisheng went out

243
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:16,040
and bought every firecracker
in the village.

244
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:16,520
Remember?

245
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,320
It was such a scene.

246
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:17,670
Totally.

247
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:19,120
The whole village came out for it.

248
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,910
I still remember. It was hands down

249
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:21,800
the liveliest day ever.

250
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,880
Even more than New Year's.

251
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,070
Secretary, let me top you off.

252
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:28,430
You're too kind.

253
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:30,400
Secretary,

254
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,070
I'm really honored you could make it.

255
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:34,400
Drink heartily today.

256
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:35,880
You're too kind.

257
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:37,120
Come on.

258
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:37,710
Alright.

259
00:14:37,834 --> 00:14:38,830
Come on, let's drink!

260
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,520
(Huanzhou University, Admission Letter)
This is worth celebrating.

261
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,600
Haisheng,

262
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,710
you and your wife did an amazing job.

263
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:48,240
Not only did you raise

264
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,910
the first student in our village
to get into a top university,

265
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,910
he was also the top scorer
in the whole Shunyun County.

266
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:55,360
Old friend,

267
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:58,360
you've really brought honor
to the Qiao family.

268
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:58,830
Thank you.

269
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,400
And to our whole village, too!

270
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:00,880
Come on!

271
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,160
Let's drink! Drink!

272
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,000
Let me see it!

273
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:03,640
I've never seen

274
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,240
(Huanzhou University, Admission Letter)
a college admission letter!

275
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:07,030
So this is it.

276
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,120
Be careful.

277
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:08,910
Don't smudge it.

278
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,670
I barely looked at it, Yanfen.

279
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:11,400
Come on, eat up!

280
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,710
Mom, I'm going out for a bit.

281
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:17,790
Alright.

282
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,670
Here, Secretary,

283
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,360
let me toast you.

284
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:20,910
Sure, sure.

285
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:21,910
Come on!

286
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,310
Lit it yourself.

287
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:24,520
Alright, I'll go for it then.

288
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,160
Great.

289
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,728
(Ye Zilin:
Sheng, a game of basketball later?)

290
00:16:13,748 --> 00:16:16,394
(Chen Hao:
Ming Sheng is in France, remember?)

291
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:19,417
(Guan Lan: France? I want to travel too.)

292
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,911
(Deng Meixi:
France is in a different time zone.)

293
00:16:22,202 --> 00:16:24,128
(Ming Sheng is probably asleep by now.)

294
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,251
(Sheng: I'm not asleep.)

295
00:16:26,591 --> 00:16:29,125
(Deng Meixi: Whoa, he actually replied!)

296
00:16:29,302 --> 00:16:31,360
(Guan Lan: Ming Sheng, is France fun?)

297
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,488
(Ye Zilin: Tell us about it!)

298
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,682
(QQ)

299
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:43,240
(It's alright.)

300
00:17:00,542 --> 00:17:02,170
(QQ)

301
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:15,742
(Sheng: Wrong message.)

302
00:17:19,482 --> 00:17:20,391
(Qingyu: Childish.)

303
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,762
(Ming Sheng:
Don't you care how I'm doing here?)

304
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,260
(Qingyu: So, are you doing okay?)

305
00:17:31,782 --> 00:17:33,980
(Video Call)

306
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,360
Hello? Can you hear me?

307
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,400
Can you hear what I'm saying?

308
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:46,600
Hello? Hello?

309
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,600
Can you hear me?

310
00:17:49,174 --> 00:17:52,805
(Qingyu:
Yes, I can't talk without a mic.)

311
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,430
You don't have to talk.

312
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,400
Just listen to me, okay?

313
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:11,910
So?

314
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,800
My mom's amazing, right?

315
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:15,990
(Mhm.)

316
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:24,840
After seeing my mom this time,

317
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,230
she felt totally different
from how I remembered her.

318
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:31,880
She isn't that sad,
depressed version of her.

319
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:34,430
Maybe leaving home

320
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,160
and leaving me

321
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,640
was actually good for her.

322
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,120
But me?

323
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:44,510
I was a mess when she left.

324
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,360
And my dad was always
too busy with work

325
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,120
to care about me.

326
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,160
Tell me...

327
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:54,710
To them,

328
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,990
am I just a burden?

329
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,710
(You're not.)

330
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:05,270
Thanks.

331
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,040
Grandma, are you sure
you remembered right?

332
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:23,840
It's not here.

333
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,710
I wouldn't forget something like that.

334
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:28,880
It was a red suitcase,

335
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:32,880
with the bedding set
I brought it as my dowry.

336
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,080
It's really nice stuff.

337
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,320
I'm saving it for
my future granddaughter-in-law.

338
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:37,640
Take a good look again.

339
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,710
Is it this one?

340
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,750
Yes, yes!

341
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,160
Careful now.

342
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,230
Be careful!

343
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,160
Slowly, slowly.

344
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:49,600
I got it!

345
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,950
Alright, let go!

346
00:19:58,805 --> 00:20:03,680
(Practice Notebook, Qin)

347
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,470
This is good stuff.

348
00:20:14,634 --> 00:20:16,950
(I don't know
how much longer I can hang on.)

349
00:20:17,797 --> 00:20:19,345
(If I fail,)

350
00:20:19,777 --> 00:20:23,400
(these words will be proof
that I was really here.)

351
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,270
(I'm not crazy.)

352
00:20:26,557 --> 00:20:28,040
(My name is Qin Wenqiu.)

353
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,190
(I'm not crazy. My name is Qin Wenqiu.)

354
00:21:14,994 --> 00:21:15,560
Mom.

355
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,430
Let me help you?

356
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:18,120
Never mind.

357
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,160
Yeah, the steps are off.

358
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,320
I need to add salt.

359
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,120
Don't worry about anything.

360
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,950
You don't even need to sit here.

361
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,160
It makes me nervous.

362
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,950
But I want to help mix the filling.

363
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,120
Just relax and sit tight.

364
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,190
Let me make you your favorite dumplings.

365
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,750
You don't have to do a thing.

366
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:35,640
Alright?

367
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,320
Okay.

368
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,160
Don't forget the salt.

369
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:40,160
Nope, it needs water too.

370
00:21:40,191 --> 00:21:41,980
(JINGLE BELLS)

371
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:46,600
Mom, that's way too much.

372
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,360
Too much?

373
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:47,600
Yeah.

374
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,470
It'll be too sticky.

375
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:49,560
It's fine.

376
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,430
Just add more flour.

377
00:21:59,430 --> 00:21:59,840
Mom.

378
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,750
How did you even survive
on your own all this time?

379
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,190
Haven't I been doing just fine?

380
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,160
Guan.

381
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:12,470
Ming Sheng.

382
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:13,080
Come in.

383
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,080
I happened to be
passing through Chinatown.

384
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,400
I brought Chinese food.

385
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,640
Chinese New Year's coming up soon.

386
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,710
I even brought flowers.

387
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:21,230
Thanks.

388
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,640
Guan.

389
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,160
Are you psychic or something?

390
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,430
How did you know we hadn't eaten?

391
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:31,230
Come on, I know her too well.

392
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:32,400
Your mom's cooking skills

393
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,710
can terrify even the bravest souls.

394
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:36,960
Once she tried to make
satay noodles for us,

395
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,120
and everyone at the table ended up
with food poisoning.

396
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,510
Alright, that's enough.

397
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:41,710
Badmouth me if you want,

398
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,560
but not to my face.

399
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,270
Ever since then,

400
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:46,470
I've made sure she never
steps foot in a kitchen again.

401
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:47,230
Give it a rest.

402
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:48,710
Alright then.

403
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:50,270
I still have prep work for the recital,

404
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:51,040
I'm heading out.

405
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:51,360
Okay.

406
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:52,560
Oh right, Ming Sheng.

407
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,600
Call me if you want anything for dinner.

408
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,320
Just don't let her near the kitchen.

409
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,510
Go on, back to your work.

410
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,750
Don't let her near the kitchen!

411
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,160
Off you go, come on.

412
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:01,910
Bye-bye!

413
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:02,560
Oh no.

414
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,470
You have flour on you.

415
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:04,000
It's fine.

416
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,270
Sorry.

417
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:05,710
Bye-bye!

418
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:11,430
Hey.

419
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:12,360
Yeah?

420
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:13,800
Into the vase.

421
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:18,510
We are still eating those dumplings.

422
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,040
We've been at it half the day.

423
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,120
No way we're stopping now.

424
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:22,470
It's not about quitting.

425
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:23,800
It's about not wasting food.

426
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,430
Did you two plan this whole thing?

427
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,120
Spread like snowflakes...

428
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:34,510
Mom.

429
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,400
Yes?

430
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,560
You and Dad have been
apart for so long now.

431
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:42,400
Have you really never thought
about starting over?

432
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:44,990
No.

433
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,560
I've already been through
one failed marriage.

434
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,230
I'm done with it.

435
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:50,670
It scares me.

436
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:01,640
Ming Sheng.

437
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:02,470
Yeah?

438
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:05,160
Honestly...

439
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,560
I haven't been a very good mom.

440
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,800
Do you ever, deep down,

441
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,230
hold that against me?

442
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:17,120
No.

443
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,640
This was all Ming Qiuxin's fault.

444
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,600
I just wanted to get away from him

445
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:26,600
as fast as I could.

446
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:50,950
Qingyu.

447
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,640
Come help me out.

448
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,270
Mom, why did you buy so much?

449
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,080
I always buy it at this time
every New Year.

450
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,080
Change their water.

451
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,640
Let them spit out the mud.

452
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,910
We'll cook them on New Year's Eve.

453
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,710
Look how lively they are.

454
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:14,320
Mom.

455
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,600
Why did you get up
in the middle of the night?

456
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,120
Me?

457
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,080
I didn't.

458
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:22,990
You did.

459
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:26,840
I don't remember that at all.

460
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,160
Qing.

461
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,080
Qing.

462
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:35,040
The village set up a holiday daycare,

463
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,400
and a few of us who went to college

464
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,760
are taking turns babysitting.

465
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,640
It's my shift today.

466
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,640
If you're free, come with me.

467
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:41,800
Sure.

468
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,990
Mom, I'm heading out with Jinrui.

469
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:44,710
Okay.

470
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,470
Twinkle, twinkle, little star.

471
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:59,080
Up above the world so high,

472
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:03,600
like a diamond in the sky.

473
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:08,040
Twinkle, twinkle, little star.

474
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:12,510
How I wonder what you are!

475
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,990
Up above the world so high...

476
00:26:16,414 --> 00:26:19,510
(My best friend
in Nanqiao Village was Bei.)

477
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,600
(She was so beautiful, so intelligent,)

478
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,750
(and such a gifted dancer.)

479
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,430
(I treated her like my student,
like my own daughter.)

480
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:31,950
(We depended on each other
in Nanqiao Village.)

481
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,600
(She once promised me)

482
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:34,640
(that one day)

483
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,800
(she would dance on stage
at the Huanzhou Grand Theatre.)

484
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,430
(She wanted me)

485
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,080
(to be in the audience,
cheering for her.)

486
00:26:41,191 --> 00:26:42,190
(Then one day,)

487
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:43,910
(Bei told me a secret.)

488
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,750
(She had fallen in love
with Qiao Jinrui.)

489
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:49,080
(Bei had a miscarriage.)

490
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,880
(The truth is,
Jinrui isn't really a Qiao.)

491
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:54,990
(To make sure
the Qiao family legacy had an heir,)

492
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:57,600
(Haisheng and Yanfen adopted Jinrui)

493
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,560
(from an orphanage
without telling anyone.)

494
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,800
(To keep his identity a secret,)

495
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:05,750
(and to protect
the Qiao family's reputation,)

496
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,160
(they dumped all the blame)

497
00:27:08,342 --> 00:27:10,560
(on Bei.)

498
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,470
(Bei's parents rushed back
to Nanqiao Village)

499
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:15,270
(when they heard the news.)

500
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:16,640
(Yanfen.)

501
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:18,640
(I must talk to Jinrui, no matter what.)

502
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,360
If I can't see him today,

503
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,840
then I'll wait until next week.

504
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,640
If not next week,

505
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,440
then the week after.

506
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,640
Either way, I need to see him.

507
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,200
I need to ask him what really happened.

508
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,710
What does this have to do with Jinrui?

509
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:30,840
Besides, they're cousins.

510
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:32,400
Do you have any proof

511
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,880
that the baby was Jinrui's?

512
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,120
This is just ridiculous.

513
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,600
Then, if the baby wasn't his,

514
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,360
why can't I just see him?

515
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,080
Why can't I ask him face-to-face?

516
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,360
If I raise a fuss
at his school or in public,

517
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,400
who does that help?

518
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,710
You? Our family? Jinrui?

519
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:46,750
Try me. I dare you.

520
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,120
Our Jinrui topped the entrance exam.

521
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,320
Everyone for miles
says he's going places.

522
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,880
Even if something did happen,

523
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,360
your daughter must've seduced him!

524
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,160
That's nonsense!

525
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,190
Don't act innocent!

526
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:00,800
At least you know that well!

527
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,230
Enough. Are you done yet?

528
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,360
You've embarrassed yourselves enough.

529
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:12,840
(Xiaobei thought her parents
would take her side.)

530
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,910
Mom...

531
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:15,430
(But instead,)

532
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:16,990
(she got a slap from her mother.)

533
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:19,360
(Bei was crushed.)

534
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:22,360
(She couldn't bring herself
to tell them the truth.)

535
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,710
(She had no idea who else)

536
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,880
(she could even turn to.)

537
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,640
(I really felt for her.)

538
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,880
(My poor Bei...)

539
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:35,230
(This must be the money
Jinrui sent to Mom.)

540
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:36,880
He sends it every month.

541
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,640
What happened with Beiyu
was partly my fault.

542
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,040
I failed to look after her.

543
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,430
That's how she ended up so lost.

544
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,040
(Nanqiao High School)
Jinrui,

545
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,560
are you also from
Nanqiao High School?

546
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:47,750
Jinrui,

547
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,160
can you tell me

548
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,950
some stories from
when Qiao Beiyu was little?

549
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:52,560
Back when we just bought the car,

550
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,910
Bei hung this up.

551
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:04,510
Up above the world so high,

552
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:09,400
like a diamond in the sky.

553
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,320
Twinkle, twinkle, little star.

554
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,600
Do you think...

555
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,670
Jinrui knows what I'm going through?

556
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:22,430
(I think Jinrui knew.)

557
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,600
(But he never came back
to Nanqiao Village again.)

558
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,560
(The news about Bei's miscarriage)

559
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,270
(was all over the village.)

560
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:31,840
Yanfen!

561
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:34,360
I haven't seen you in days.

562
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:34,840
Come on.

563
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,560
Come on, sit down,
have some sunflower seeds.

564
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:36,880
Alright.

565
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,510
Here, take this.

566
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:38,950
Come on.

567
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,080
Did you hear?

568
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,710
Someone said Bei

569
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:45,910
came back from winter break
at Huanzhou Art School,

570
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:47,230
and had a miscarriage.

571
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:49,320
Yanfen, you really ought to
keep a close eye on her.

572
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,360
Bei, where did you go?

573
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,560
Out having fun again?

574
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:54,710
I didn't.

575
00:29:55,834 --> 00:29:57,990
(Bei never
explained anything to anyone.)

576
00:29:58,445 --> 00:30:00,640
(She just kept it all to herself.)

577
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:14,120
Here.

578
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,230
Here you go, Jinrui.

579
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,230
Thanks, Grandma.

580
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:20,190
Yu, here you go.

581
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,320
Thank you, Grandma.

582
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:22,990
Good.

583
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,510
Everyone, eat while it's hot.

584
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,400
Have some wine too.

585
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:30,470
Qing.

586
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:33,710
You've been cooped up
in your room these past few days.

587
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,230
If you're not eating,
and you won't even come downstairs.

588
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,560
You can't keep doing that.

589
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,200
New Year is just around the corner.

590
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,670
Our relatives are coming over to visit.

591
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:44,230
Uncle Zhang even asked about you today.

592
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,430
I was in my room doing homework.

593
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:48,000
I don't even know those people.

594
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:51,430
They were just
being polite asking about you.

595
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:53,320
You should've just smiled and said hi.

596
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,270
That's what younger folks should do.

597
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:56,710
It's not like school starts tomorrow.

598
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:58,040
Why the rush with homework?

599
00:31:58,430 --> 00:31:59,190
Exactly.

600
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:00,840
You'll get married sooner or later.

601
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,230
If you ask me,

602
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,910
Qing was doing just fine
at Shunyun No.1 High School.

603
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:06,950
Why transfer out?

604
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:09,710
Huanzhou's a big city.

605
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:11,470
You get all kinds of people there.

606
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:14,270
Yu's a boy, so it's good for him

607
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:16,190
to go see more of the world.

608
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:17,320
But Qing's a girl.

609
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,560
What if she picks up bad habits?

610
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:19,710
Yanfen.

611
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,950
We heard that over in Huanzhou,

612
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:23,910
the teaching quality is
actually really good.

613
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:26,120
So we just wanted Qingyu to work hard,

614
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,040
and see if she could get
into a good college.

615
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:31,840
Honestly, she just keeps her head
down in her books.

616
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,750
That's all she does.

617
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,880
I'm not too worried.

618
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,990
Oh please, it's not like
you can read her mind.

619
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:43,840
Don't blame me for being blunt.

620
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:46,320
Girls these days have so much
going on in their minds.

621
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,080
Some mature really early.

622
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:49,910
They go astray around 16 and 17.

623
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:51,710
You two really need to keep an eye out.

624
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:54,840
Be careful to protect Qing
from bad influences in Huanzhou.

625
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:59,710
Qiao Beiyu grew up in Nanqiao Village,

626
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:01,840
who led her astray?

627
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:07,990
Our family is known

628
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:09,950
for having strong family values.

629
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:12,160
We both treated Bei

630
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:13,320
with all our hearts.

631
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,750
We raised her like our own daughter.

632
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:16,840
Everyone in the village knows that.

633
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,710
If you say she was led astray,

634
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,560
then odds are

635
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:23,190
it was Jiangsheng's wife's influence.

636
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:25,670
Why are you pinning this on me?

637
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:27,560
Jinrui,

638
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:29,640
is what Aunt Yanfen said true?

639
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:32,430
Did Qiao Beiyu somehow
get a bad influence from you?

640
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,080
Jinrui has always had

641
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:38,270
great character.

642
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:39,880
Go ask anyone around here.

643
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:41,990
No one can find a single fault in him.

644
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:43,840
Exactly.

645
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,430
If Jinrui had a problem,

646
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:46,520
would Xiaoyun's parents

647
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,080
agree to marry their wonderful daughter

648
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:48,910
to Jinrui?

649
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,560
Her family holds leadership positions
in the government.

650
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,470
They are well off.

651
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:54,990
They agreed to this match

652
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:58,560
because Jinrui
is capable and dependable.

653
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:01,990
Qing, it's a good thing
it was only family here tonight.

654
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:03,750
If an outsider had heard what you said,

655
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,430
what would they think?

656
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,160
Right, Dad?

657
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:09,640
Lusheng.

658
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,710
You're the head of your household.

659
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,710
Why don't you say something?

660
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:20,040
These are all your elders.

661
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:21,520
Watch how you speak.

662
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,190
When Qiao Beiyu was little,

663
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:31,040
she was always soft-spoken and gentle.

664
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,640
How could she change so suddenly?

665
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,000
Someone must've led her astray.

666
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:35,830
She may be gone,

667
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:37,710
but that doesn't erase the past.

668
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:42,960
Enough.

669
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:49,160
Alright.

670
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,960
Don't fault Qingyu for this.

671
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:53,480
Girls of her age are usually sensitive.

672
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,270
We can't blame her
for having weird thoughts.

673
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,520
Qingyu,

674
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,560
I know you care about your sister.

675
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:01,790
Everyone's heartbroken over Beiyu.

676
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:04,350
But in the end,
we all walk the path we choose.

677
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,040
You can't blame others for that.

678
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:07,750
I think

679
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:09,520
Beiyu would've wanted us

680
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,710
to remember the good in her.

681
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,440
As for what happened in the past,

682
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,120
let's just leave it behind.

683
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,350
Alright, alright.

684
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:23,440
It's all in the past.

685
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:25,790
No more of that. Let's eat.

686
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,120
Dad, here's a toast to you.

687
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:54,960
Pour some water.

688
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:05,750
Qingyu.

689
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:07,440
Let me warn you.

690
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:09,270
Watch what you say these next few days.

691
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,120
Don't stir up any trouble.

692
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,310
You're not a kid anymore.

693
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,870
You know how serious this is.

694
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,440
We're in the middle
of planning Jinrui's wedding.

695
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,960
Don't you go messing anything up.

696
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:20,750
Says who?

697
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:22,640
Says who?

698
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,480
Jinrui is the first one
to go to college,

699
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,350
the most promising kid in the village.

700
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,440
Besides,

701
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,400
he helped you transfer schools.

702
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,520
He even sent your transcript.

703
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:34,870
You might need his help
finding a job too.

704
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:38,710
What about what he did to Beiyu?

705
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:41,560
Who? Jinrui and Beiyu?

706
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,790
How do you know about that?

707
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:44,830
Who told you?

708
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:46,480
That's all just gossip and nonsense.

709
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:54,920
You...

710
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,480
Your temper is way too soft.

711
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,190
You listen to your wife
about everything.

712
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,710
Look what Qing has become

713
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:03,040
under her influence.

714
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,080
In this house,

715
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,480
a man should have the final say.

716
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,390
No matter what you know,

717
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:16,960
you keep it to yourself.

718
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,440
Even if you know, act like you don't.

719
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,160
Beiyu brought enough shame to us.

720
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,960
People still talk about it.

721
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,350
If you drag Jinrui into this too,

722
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:28,160
even your grandpa

723
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,190
will be humiliated.

724
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:30,920
Great.

725
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,120
No one in the Qiao family is innocent.

726
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,230
They all failed Qiao Beiyu.

727
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,120
Don't you want justice for Qiao Beiyu?

728
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:36,520
No.

729
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:38,440
I don't.

730
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,270
Justice?

731
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:43,920
There is no justice.

732
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,160
Everyone wants justice,

733
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,120
but not everyone gets it.

734
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,000
If you're any good,

735
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,750
get into a good college.

736
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:52,790
Make us proud.

737
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,440
I'm saying this for your own good.

738
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:06,000
A wife is still an outsider.

739
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:10,830
Only we are truly family.

740
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,640
Alright.

741
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,350
It's getting late. I'm heading back.

742
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,520
Take care, Haisheng.

743
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:24,830
Bye.

744
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:38,710
You never stop drinking.

745
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,520
That's all you ever do.

746
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,080
You said it yourself.

747
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:44,750
Haisheng just drinks

748
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:45,790
and does nothing useful.

749
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,160
Qiao Lusheng.

750
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:48,830
Yes?

751
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:50,870
I'm warning you.

752
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:52,960
Don't get his bad influence.

753
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,080
Do you hear me?

754
00:38:57,790 --> 00:38:58,270
Okay.

755
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:11,790
Jinrui.

756
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,270
Is my groomsman suit ready?

757
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,640
Yeah, it's all altered.

758
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,190
Here you go.

759
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,000
I was going to drop it off

760
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,040
at your place tonight.

761
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,790
But since you're here, perfect timing.

762
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,230
Congrats, Jinrui.

763
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,160
If Beiyu were still here,

764
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,040
she'd be happy for you.

765
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,230
It's my fault I didn't protect her.

766
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:38,270
Otherwise, she wouldn't have
died so young.

767
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:39,600
Don't dwell on it.

768
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,190
Everything will be alright.

769
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:42,920
I'm heading out.

770
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:52,920
Feihai!

771
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:55,520
Qingyu.

772
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:56,870
You need something?

773
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,080
Are you going to the wedding?

774
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,440
Jinrui is getting married.

775
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,480
Of course I'll be there.

776
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,080
But what if Beiyu
didn't want you to go?

777
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,830
Qiao Jinrui did something
unforgivable to Qiao Beiyu.

778
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,750
If you really cared about her,

779
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:12,040
then do it for her. Don't go.

780
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:17,400
Is there
some misunderstanding about him?

781
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,560
It's not a misunderstanding.

782
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:19,960
He is a total hypocrite.

783
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,750
Everything he did
for Beiyu was just an act.

784
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:22,310
Qingyu.

785
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:23,710
I know.

786
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,830
Beiyu's passing was so sudden.

787
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:27,750
It's hard for you to accept it.

788
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:29,310
You want to find someone

789
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:30,310
to blame for her pain.

790
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:31,480
But that person

791
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,560
can't be Jinrui.

792
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,790
If Beiyu knew

793
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,520
you were going to

794
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,710
hurt Jinrui in her name,

795
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:38,920
she'd be really disappointed.

796
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:39,920
How would you know?

797
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,520
You know nothing!

798
00:40:42,374 --> 00:40:43,080
Qingyu!

799
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,520
(Everyone's heartbroken over Beiyu.)

800
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,270
(But in the end,
we all walk the path we choose.)

801
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,040
(You can't blame others for that.)

802
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,390
(Is there some
misunderstanding about him?)

803
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,190
(But that person)

804
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:06,270
(can't be Jinrui.)

805
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,520
(If Beiyu knew)

806
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:09,230
(you were going to)

807
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:10,440
(hurt Jinrui in her name,)

808
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,640
(she'd be really disappointed.)

809
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,480
(Everyone wants justice,)

810
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,390
(but not everyone gets it.)

811
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,230
What a coincidence.

812
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,960
So the charm in your car

813
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,160
is part of the same set
as Beiyu's music box.

814
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,080
Where did you find all these?

815
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:42,920
I had a dream last night.

816
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:44,790
Qiao Beiyu told me

817
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,270
there was a music box in the attic.

818
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,920
And I actually found it this morning.

819
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:50,960
Do you think she appeared in my dream

820
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:53,790
because she still had
some unfinished business?

821
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:56,120
What was she trying to tell me?

822
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,350
Nonsense.

823
00:42:57,870 --> 00:42:59,390
People don't go into others' dreams.

824
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,160
That's you in the photo, right?

825
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:03,190
Of course not.

826
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:04,120
How could it be?

827
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:05,920
Jinrui.

828
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:10,120
