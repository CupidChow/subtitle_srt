=Reborn=

14
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,080
(Adapted from the serialized work "Reborn"
by Qiang Yu)

15
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,220
Well, if it isn't Qiao Qingyu.

16
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,000
The moment I saw you, I remembered.

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,270
A couple days ago,
I saw Ming Sheng getting out of a cab

18
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,910
with a girl.

19
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:53,100
That girl was you, wasn't it?

20
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:55,760
Was Qingyu staying

21
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,020
at Ming Sheng's grandfather's house
while she was missing?

22
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,020
They're close, aren't they?

23
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,190
Don't talk nonsense.

24
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:03,880
She was staying

25
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,960
with some distant relatives of ours
during that time.

26
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,100
Mind your own business

27
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:08,950
from now on.

28
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,550
I wasn't making anything up.

29
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:12,620
I remember exactly

30
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,150
what she was wearing that day.

31
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:14,510
She...

32
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:15,990
Mom, you guys are back.

33
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,390
Come on, let's go home.

34
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,550
Let's go.

35
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:29,620
Why are you back too?

36
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,390
Pour me a glass of water.

37
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,400
I left a pair of cleats at home.

38
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,440
The teacher said
I couldn't attend class without them.

39
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,660
I had to come back to get them.

40
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,580
Always so forgetful.

41
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,620
Think hard if there's anything else
you left behind.

42
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,060
Stop making trips back and forth.

43
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,780
You're wasting time.

44
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,000
I'll leave the key here.

45
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,440
I'm heading back to the noodle shop.

46
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,340
Remember to lock the door behind you.

47
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:54,400
Got it, Mom.

48
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,620
Bring the key over to me later.

49
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,110
Okay.

50
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:00,980
(I'll always be here
when you turn back.)

51
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:10,990
Jinyu.

52
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:11,550
Yeah?

53
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:13,670
Do me a favor.

54
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,990
I need to go out for a bit.

55
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,550
Where are you going?

56
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,340
If Mom finds out,
she won't let me off easy.

57
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:21,830
I need to see Ming Sheng.

58
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:28,390
Qingyu,

59
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:29,710
what's going on

60
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,340
between you and Ming Sheng?

61
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:34,950
The shopkeeper downstairs
is so annoying.

62
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,830
I heard she's been coming to our shop

63
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,180
every other day to eat noodles.

64
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,900
Then, she grabs Mom

65
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,950
and gossips about you and Ming Sheng.

66
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,740
Don't pay her any attention.

67
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,710
Next time she shows up,
just kick her out.

68
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:48,670
If we make her mad,

69
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:49,860
she'll talk even more trash

70
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,580
about our family.

71
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,340
Mom said

72
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:56,550
we rented both the shop and the house
until September.

73
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,340
Once the lease is up,

74
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:59,620
we're moving.

75
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,390
Then next year,

76
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,340
after you graduate from high school,

77
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,150
you'll go to college in another city.

78
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,990
I'll stay in Huanzhou for school.

79
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,390
Mom and Dad will move back to Shunyun.

80
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:13,510
It'll be easier on us financially
that way.

81
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:18,510
Qingyu, seriously, what happened
between you and Ming Sheng?

82
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,830
Nothing.

83
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,150
Then why did you go to his house?

84
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,100
It's not something
I can explain in a few words,

85
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,870
but I have to see him today.

86
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:36,190
There won't be anything
between us after this.

87
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:43,780
You roped me into this.

88
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,540
Fine,

89
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:48,750
since you didn't rat me out

90
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,340
for swiping something

91
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,710
from the drawer,

92
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,070
I'll help you.

93
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,070
But if you want to meet Ming Sheng,

94
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,540
at least tell him in advance.

95
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,310
I still have to return the key to Mom.

96
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,580
That gives us at most two hours

97
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,660
to pull this off.

98
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,150
That's enough time.

99
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,340
I'll go to the Internet café
and send him a message.

100
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:11,510
You think a message is enough
to get him to show up?

101
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:13,870
Let's hope so.

102
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:20,740
=Episode 15=
(Meet Me Under The Big Tree)

103
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,720
(Qingyu:
Meet me under the big tree. Now.)

104
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,710
(Pay me back for my leaves.)

105
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,710
(They're not yours.)

106
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,270
This tree is mine.

107
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,070
(This tree can talk.)

108
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,150
(It's saying...)

109
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,870
I shouldn't have
snapped at you yesterday.

110
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,150
(I'm sorry.)

111
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,320
I heard your mom keeps
a tight leash on you.

112
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,220
Didn't think
you'd actually make it out this fast.

113
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,540
My mom said if you bother me again,

114
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,220
she'll burn your house down.

115
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,020
She's not joking.

116
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:37,190
That's kind of funny, actually.

117
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:40,070
Trying to hide something
only makes it more obvious.

118
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,020
But if it weren't for your mom,

119
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:44,780
I wouldn't have realized

120
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:47,070
just how important I am to you.

121
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,220
Don't say that.

122
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,420
I'm not making things up.

123
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,540
You saw my note

124
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,190
and wanted to meet up.

125
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,540
Shouldn't you at least explain

126
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:04,070
why you left without a word?

127
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,310
What makes you think

128
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:13,510
I'd choose you over my family?

129
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:19,310
You wanted to run away more than I did.

130
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:22,100
To you, this was just a game.

131
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:25,900
That's right.

132
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,900
It's a game I was willing
to bet my future

133
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,390
and everything I had on.

134
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,470
I asked to meet you today

135
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:36,880
because some things are better said

136
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,230
face to face.

137
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,540
I'm grateful for everything
you've done for me.

138
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,820
But nothing has ever happened
between us.

139
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:48,780
Not before. Not now.

140
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,110
Not ever.

141
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:56,470
I don't understand.

142
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:02,820
There's no future for us.

143
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,060
What do you mean, no future?

144
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:09,590
After high school, you'll go abroad.

145
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,870
I'll stay here.

146
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:13,350
Our lives were never meant

147
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,990
to intersect.

148
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,230
You have your future.

149
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:19,270
I can't ruin it.

150
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:21,750
When I was overseas,

151
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,020
I helped you.

152
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,940
When you had a fever
at the train station

153
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:25,720
during New Year's,

154
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,640
I came to get you.

155
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,590
It's my future.
I get to decide what to do with it.

156
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:30,020
But I'm not like you.

157
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,700
From the moment I was dragged back home,

158
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,540
I lost.

159
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,020
I can't hurt my family again.

160
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,900
And I can't run away a second time.

161
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,870
Just treat me
like you did last semester.

162
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,180
Like someone you ignore,

163
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,540
or someone you hate.

164
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,780
I never ignored you.

165
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:43,990
And I never hated you.

166
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:45,180
But if I didn't know you,

167
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,780
my life would be a lot easier.

168
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,780
You're a burden to me.

169
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,270
I've hated you since the start.

170
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,700
You were arrogant and cocky,

171
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,420
always pushing me around.

172
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,060
Even if my life is a mess,

173
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,420
we're not the same kind of people.

174
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,110
Qiao Qingyu,

175
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,390
I never meant to hurt you.

176
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,300
I'm really sorry.

177
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,590
It's fine if you don't forgive me.

178
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:28,630
But can you please

179
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:31,060
just not hate me?

180
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,270
I hate you.

181
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,540
Qiao Qingyu,

182
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,110
I really thought
you and I were the same.

183
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,020
Turns out,

184
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,540
I was wrong.

185
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,660
What would you choose?

186
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,540
I'd choose freedom, no question.

187
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,270
What's the point of living a life

188
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,990
without freedom?

189
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:46,390
Qiao Qingyu,

190
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,660
are we still friends?

191
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:04,900
Never mind. Forget I asked.

192
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:14,230
Ming Sheng,

193
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:19,510
thank you for everything.

194
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,900
There's no point

195
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,660
in talking anymore.

196
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,350
Just go.

197
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:39,420
♪Turns out♪

198
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:43,860
♪Your heart had a place for me too♪

199
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:49,520
♪Cradling the same story we both knew♪

200
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:53,760
♪Thankfully, we were naive enough♪

201
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:57,380
♪And brave just in time♪

202
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:03,880
♪To make sure our moments
weren't lost to time♪

203
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:29,020
(Every choice in life)

204
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,870
(feels like a battle against yourself.)

205
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,510
(The hardest part)

206
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,390
(is not being doubted by others.)

207
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,470
(It's doubting yourself.)

208
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:55,780
(It felt like my whole inner world
just collapsed.)

209
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:59,110
(As if I had never connected)

210
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:01,230
(with the world around me.)

211
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:04,060
(Everything felt like chaos.)

212
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,900
(Like I was standing in a thick fog.)

213
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,270
(My body kept growing,
following the usual path,)

214
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,540
(but my soul was completely lost.)

215
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,420
Guan Lan,

216
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:40,870
I was only one point behind you overall.

217
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:43,420
One place behind in class rank.

218
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:46,510
But I'm 20 places behind you
in the whole grade.

219
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:49,160
Now I finally get what Sun meant,

220
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,230
how just one point
can change everything on the NCEE.

221
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,350
Excuse me.

222
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:54,900
What's the rush, Ye Zilin?

223
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,780
You're always at the bottom.
No suspense there.

224
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,780
I'm checking Sheng's results for him.

225
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:01,350
Not bad, 14th place.

226
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:04,080
Full marks in Biology and Physics.

227
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,780
Did something light a fire
under Ming Sheng?

228
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,320
He's not handing
in blank papers anymore?

229
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,990
Going from 0 to 100 on a whim.

230
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,870
Now that's a real skill.

231
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,930
(Qiao Qingyu, 598, 13)
Oh? Qiao Qingyu got 13th?

232
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,650
(Ming Sheng, 580, 14)
1314.

233
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,630
Forever and ever.

234
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:18,900
Pfft.

235
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,870
Sheng. Sheng, look.

236
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,060
Is that funny to you?

237
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:27,470
Is it not?

238
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,540
Not even a little?

239
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,020
It's 1314.

240
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:40,630
It's not that funny.

241
00:15:58,630 --> 00:15:59,420
Qingyu.

242
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:02,700
Mr. Sun.

243
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,300
Mr. Pan told me

244
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,510
about your essay.

245
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:09,700
I didn't expect

246
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:12,150
someone who usually seems
so quiet and gentle

247
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:14,110
would be carrying such heavy burdens.

248
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:17,900
Look.

249
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:20,660
I've gone through that phase too.

250
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:23,870
Where all the common values

251
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:25,510
and "truths of life"

252
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,180
suddenly stop making sense.

253
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,350
I was frustrated too.

254
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:30,130
I didn't know

255
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:31,540
if there was something wrong with me,

256
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,900
or if the world had gone off-track.

257
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,390
But eventually I realized

258
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,600
those standards aren't set in stone.

259
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,940
You have to look at the context.

260
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:42,630
For example, hiding things.

261
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,320
It's not always wrong.

262
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,700
It depends on why you're hiding it.

263
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,540
The best kind of growth

264
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,350
is to face life calmly with restraint.

265
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,270
All the things
that once hurt you deeply.

266
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:57,060
In time,

267
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,510
(they fade.)

268
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,520
(Every day we go through so much.)

269
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,700
(We meet all kinds of people.)

270
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:05,260
(We can't predict or control any of it.)

271
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,560
(Instead of resisting,)

272
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,390
(maybe it's better
to face it all with a smile.)

273
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,200
(Psychological Wellness Counseling Center)
(This week the school invited)

274
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,550
(to provide counseling for students.)

275
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,460
(If you have anything on your mind,)

276
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,870
(you can talk to her.)

277
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:17,900
(She's a professional.)

278
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,120
(In any case,
your teachers and the school)

279
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,420
(hope you'll be able
to work through what's troubling you.)

280
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:25,460
I'm sorry.

281
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,870
It's okay.

282
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,700
Come find me

283
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,980
whenever you feel ready.

284
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,700
I couldn't talk to Dr. Le Fan.

285
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:59,630
I have too much on my mind.

286
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:02,260
Things I can't tell anyone.

287
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:05,740
I've had insomnia for a while now.

288
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,500
Because your parents fight all the time?

289
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:18,740
I don't even know
how much longer I can take this.

290
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:21,550
Mumu,

291
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,660
once you get through the NCEE
and leave home,

292
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,220
things will get better.

293
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:27,550
But...

294
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,030
What about my mom?

295
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,660
What's she supposed to do?

296
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:40,260
Sure, I can leave home.

297
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:43,500
But I'll always be their daughter.

298
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:45,870
They'll always be my parents.

299
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:48,150
I don't have to live with them,

300
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,550
but the messed-up relationship
between us

301
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:53,030
will last a lifetime.

302
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:54,980
There's no real escape.

303
00:18:58,980 --> 00:18:59,980
That's why I envy you,

304
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,350
Qingyu.

305
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,260
You can endure.

306
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,870
You can stand your ground.

307
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:11,790
Because there's still light inside you.

308
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:16,110
That's why
you're not afraid of the dark.

309
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,260
No, Mumu.

310
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:24,660
My light was almost gone.

311
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,110
But I had you.

312
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,070
You saved me.

313
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:38,220
That's what everyone says about me.

314
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:39,700
"Warm,"

315
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:41,420
"kind,"

316
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:42,980
"like a breath of spring,"

317
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,420
"thoughtful."

318
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:48,830
You don't like it?

319
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,310
It's not about liking it or not.

320
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,460
It's just

321
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,870
the road ahead of me

322
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,360
feels really dark.

323
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,660
And I can't seem to find
the light at the end of the tunnel.

324
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:10,830
So Qingyu,

325
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,980
I admire your courage.

326
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:16,220
At least you do the things

327
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:18,460
you want to do.

328
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,940
There will be light.

329
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,740
Come on, rookie. Let's play ball.

330
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:51,790
Sheng's not here.

331
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,500
Deng Meixi had a biology question
she didn't understand,

332
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,830
so Sheng went
to the library to explain it to her.

333
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:57,830
The library, huh?

334
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:58,940
Sheng's stepping up.

335
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,420
All right.

336
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,110
Next time.

337
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,350
Let's go.

338
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,180
Pack up your stuff.

339
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,790
Sheng said we're going
to karaoke this afternoon.

340
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,390
With No.1 High School's campus beauty?

341
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:09,790
Hurry up.

342
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,420
I've got a buddy who's been trying
to ask her out forever.

343
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:15,590
Sheng dates No.1 School's beauty.

344
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,180
Is this a power couple?

345
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:18,660
Are we witnessing history here?

346
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,350
Let's go.
Even our essays weren't this long.

347
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,260
Come on!

348
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,590
Are you okay?

349
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,740
The bike broke down again.

350
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:37,740
Your dad, honestly.

351
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,260
He keeps trying to patch it up

352
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:40,590
just to save 20-30 yuan.

353
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,150
Isn't that the girl from TV
the other day?

354
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:49,790
Yeah.

355
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:51,150
The one who made a scene

356
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:52,980
at the wedding on the forum.

357
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,040
She's a looker.

358
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:54,880
Let's check her out.

359
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,460
She's cute.

360
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,390
Isn't this the younger sister

361
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:00,830
of Shunyun's most beautiful girl?

362
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:01,240
Yeah.

363
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,350
You've got the wrong person.

364
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:03,740
No, we didn't, ma'am.

365
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,960
You're the owner of Qiao's Noodle Shop.

366
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,000
We eat there all the time.

367
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,310
Something's going on over there.

368
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:11,500
Tell her to come eat with us.

369
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,790
Let go! What are you doing?

370
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,630
Isn't that Qiao Qingyu?

371
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:15,350
Ma'am.

372
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,460
Come on.
We're just trying to make friends.

373
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,590
Who wants to be your friend?

374
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:19,550
Let's just go.

375
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:22,180
Huh? We're just going to leave?

376
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:38,900
Seriously? You're...

377
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,220
Hey! Why'd you hit him?

378
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,310
You can't do this to us!

379
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:48,310
We have a date with the campus beauty
from No.1 High School, right?

380
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:50,500
What time are we going?

381
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:51,660
Sing karaoke, my foot.

382
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:52,500
Huh?

383
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,120
Thanks.

384
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,220
So you didn't ask her out?

385
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,500
Then why'd you call us over?

386
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,550
To eat instant noodles
and admire the view with you?

387
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:01,310
I told my dad
I had evening self-study tonight.

388
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:02,980
This is a bit of a letdown.

389
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:04,420
Eat your food.

390
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:11,590
Sheng.

391
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,350
Why did you pretend

392
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,700
not to know Qiao Qingyu just now?

393
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:17,320

395
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:22,740
You and Qiao Qingyu had a falling-out?

396
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:25,870
Got it.

397
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:28,980
This is that classic
push-pull tactic, huh?

398
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,870
Play hard to get, right?

399
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:31,870
Just eat.

400
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,700
Food still can't shut you up?

401
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,870

Look closely. There are flaws.

See? That's Qiao Qingyu's face,
from that news.

457

They changed her hair.

458
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,280

to click on the post

All right, the truth's out.

to Qiao Qingyu.

Missing one test
won't keep her out of college.

The school already does health checks
every semester. This is unnecessary.

Did you not hear what I said?

503
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,800
A blood test will put
people's minds at ease.

It'll put a stop to the rumors.

Why give them something
to talk about when you're innocent?

506

Let them talk if they've got the energy.

507
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:58,920
The innocent don't need
to prove anything.

508
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,630
You have no idea
how nasty people are being.

509
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:02,480
They're saying
your whole family is messed up.

510
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:05,900
If someone sees you at the hospital,

511
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,500
the gossip will only get worse.

512
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,590
Then why don't you go too?

513
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:12,390
Mom, I'll go.

514
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,180
It's just a blood test.

515
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:18,420
It'll be quick.
I'll go to school after it's done.

Your mother's fast asleep.

517
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,980
She's been like that lately.

518
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:05,630
Either she can't sleep at all,

519
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:07,550
or once she's out, she's out cold.

520
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:10,260
It's normal at her age.

521
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:15,830
I'll sleep out here tonight.

522
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,420
I don't want to disturb her.

523
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,790
I thought

524
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,350
this would all blow over eventually.

525
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,070
Didn't think it'd get dug up again.

526
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:41,070
I don't like fighting with your mother.

You've got the NCEE coming up.

528
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:49,420
Your mother and I
used to be good together.

529
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:53,660
Back when we got married,

530
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,460
people mostly met through matchmakers.

531
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:58,070
At least

532
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,030
we fell in love on our own.

533
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:06,460
Yet, somehow,

534
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:09,110
life just ended up like this.

535
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:14,830
Stop drinking, Dad.

536
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:26,790
Qingyu,
I'm not ashamed to tell you this.

537
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:29,830
As a man,

538
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,870
I'm supposed

539
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:35,660
to be the pillar of this family.

540
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:41,030
But most of the time,

541
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:44,260
I just can't hold it up.

542
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:47,790
You guys play a round. Sub me in later.

543
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,180
You're not going to tell Qiao Qingyu

544
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:00,660
about what happened yesterday?

545
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:05,830
It's none of her concern.

546
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,940
Sheng, your dad's here.

547
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:11,180
He's in Mr. Sun's office.

548
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:15,660
How many times has it been?

549
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:20,390
Yikes.

550
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:25,420
He looks really mad.

551
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:28,980
Sun's really laying
into your dad this time.

552
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,550
This isn't the first time.

553
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:31,830
Once, twice, thrice. But...

554
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:33,700
I think

555
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:36,550
your dad's definitely
going to rip into you tonight.

556
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:39,350
You're toast, Sheng.

557
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:40,460
Sheng.

558
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:43,630
Sheng.

559
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:04,500
Oh, I see you!

560
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:05,460
Hello.

561
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,830
How's the signal over there?

562
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:09,630
It's okay. It's not lagging or anything.

563
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:12,700
My performance's over.
It went wonderfully!

564
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:14,030
It was a huge success!

565
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:16,350
During the final curtain call,

566
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:17,940
the applause lasted

567
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:19,830
four or five minutes.

568
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,630
You have no idea how emotional I was.

569
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:23,660
Oh, right.

570
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,420
This was a gift from one of my fans.

571
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:27,980
Congratulations, Mom.

572
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:30,260
Keep up the good work.

573
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,030
Thank you.

574
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:37,900
What about you? How's everything?

575
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:38,830
I'm doing all right.

576
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,030
Really upset Dr. Ming again

577
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:41,870
at school today.

578
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:44,070
I call it a small win.

579
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:45,110
Sheng...

580
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:46,310
Mom, don't try to talk me down.

581
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:47,980
I meant to upset him.

582
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:50,150
Whatever he wants me to do,

583
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:51,790
I'll do the opposite.

584
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:01,630
You're a big boy now.

585
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,550
We can talk to each other as equals,

586
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:04,630
like adults.

587
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:06,550
Will you hear me out?

588
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:07,070
Mm.

589
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:09,030
I really don't want you and your dad

590
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:11,380
to stay in such a hostile relationship.

591
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:13,660
I know how much he loves you.

592
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:15,180
He's just bad at showing it.

593
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:16,780
The two of you

594
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,780
can communicate openly,

595
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,340
like you and I

596
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:22,700
are doing now. Okay?

597
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,260
Be right back.

598
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:41,150
There's something

599
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:46,110
I've kept buried for over ten years.

600
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,700
I want to tell you now.

601
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:52,470
Back then,

602
00:34:56,950 --> 00:34:58,820
I was the one
who chose to leave your father.

603
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:13,550
(At the time,)

604
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:16,180
(he put all his energy into work.)

605
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,720
(We argued a lot.)

606
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,300
(I felt that if we kept going that way,)

607
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,950
(we would just keep hurting each other,)

608
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:25,340
so I insisted on leaving.

609
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:28,590
I was young,

610
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:31,030
impulsive,

611
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,630
(and stubborn.)

612
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,780
I insisted on taking you with me.

613
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,430
But your grandfather wouldn't let me.

614
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:43,630
(Frankly, he had a point.)

615
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,910
(I was alone in France with no support.)

616
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,260
(Barely able to feed myself.)

617
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,700
(How could I have possibly
given you a normal life?)

618
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:02,150
He said I could go,

619
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:05,740
but you had to stay.

620
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,300
(I was selfish.)

621
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:11,590
Because of my selfishness,

622
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:14,590
your relationship with your father

623
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:16,150
ended up the way it is.

624
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:22,950
(And because of my selfishness,)

625
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,660
(you became rebellious.)

626
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,340
I'm not asking for your forgiveness.

627
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:32,340
I just wanted you to know the truth.

628
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:34,260
I'm sorry.

629
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,070
(I'm sorry.)

630
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:48,910
Yanqiu.

631
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:58,910
You're taking good care
of Dr. Chen's dog.

632
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,150
You don't know

633
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:01,470
how much it drove me crazy

634
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:02,660
when it first got here.

635
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:05,260
Things only started
to feel manageable recently.

636
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:08,300
I brought you some fruits.

637
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:09,950
Thank you.

638
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,910
It's windy today.

639
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:21,740
Is that so?

640
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,470
How's everything at home?

641
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:29,510
It's all right.

642
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:30,590
Good to hear.

643
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,260
The family of the deceased patient

644
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:38,220
already filed
for a medical malpractice evaluation.

645
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:41,000
The mediation committee
has also stepped in.

646
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,700
We should get a result
in the next few days.

647
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,800
Everyone has to face birth,
aging, illness, and death.

648
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:54,340
When someone's sick or hospitalized

649
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:56,430
and the treatment doesn't work out,

650
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,740
it all becomes the doctor's fault.

651
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,590
But doctors are just people too.

652
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,950
They become the outlet
for everyone's frustration.

653
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,990
Even after suffering so much injustice,

654
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:10,150
they still have to go back
and save lives.

655
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:10,780
Mm.

656
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:14,780
Perhaps that's the greatness
and the burden

657
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:16,510
of this profession.

658
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,110
Everyone sees things

659
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:27,590
from their own point of view,

660
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:29,590
and they only want to stand

661
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:30,430
on their own side.

662
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:35,550
During this time,

663
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:38,430
I've had
a lot of quiet moments to reflect.

664
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:40,550
I started trying

665
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:42,630
to look at things

666
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,070
from the patient's point of view,

667
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:45,820
and sometimes

668
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:47,780
even from my son's perspective.

669
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:50,550
That's when I began

670
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:52,340
to understand

671
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:54,470
why they were so angry, so resentful.

672
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:57,030
And the moment I understood them,

673
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:58,780
the knot in my heart began

674
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,590
to loosen too.

675
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:02,740
Whatever happens,

676
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:04,110
I believe in you.

677
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:10,780
Don't make it sound so dramatic.

678
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:12,510
It's not that bad.

679
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,780
Even if I can't perform surgery anymore,

680
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:17,470
there are still

681
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:20,030
other things I can do.

682
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:22,740
I believe in fairness and justice.

683
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,180
And I believe in you.

684
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:27,860
Enough about me. Let's talk about you.

685
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:29,300
How've you been lately?

686
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:30,510
I...

687
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:32,590
Didn't Madam Zhang try

688
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,910
to set you up on a date?

689
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:37,780
I'm sure the match was to your liking?

690
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:43,180
Yes. He's a good man.

691
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:43,860
Good.

692
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:51,470
I'm warning you!

693
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:53,110
(Police)
What are you staring at, huh?

694
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:54,110
Use your words.

695
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:55,000
You trying to ruin me?

696
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,590
Listen to me. Let go.
You can talk to us.

697
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:58,560
I'm your father!
You called the cops on me?

698
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,700
This is a residential area.
Stop disturbing the peace.

699
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:03,560
Don't grab me! I'll yell if I want to!
I raised you,

700
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,740
and this is how you repay me?

701
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:06,550
(Police)
Please get in the car.

702
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:12,700
I regret ever having you!

703
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,860
- I'm warning you...
- Please get in the car.

704
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:23,260
Mumu.

705
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:42,430
I called the police

706
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:44,110
last night.

707
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:47,630
I wanted to help my mom.

708
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:51,150
Just once, I wanted to be brave like you

709
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:52,510
and do something.

710
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:55,900
When the police came,

711
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,760
they asked my mom
if she wanted to press charges

712
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,990
against my dad,

713
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:02,110
and she said no without even thinking.

714
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:05,030
After they left,

715
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:08,510
my dad got even angrier

716
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:11,070
and wrecked the house.

717
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:13,110
My mom said I was being immature.

718
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:15,110
She questioned
how I could send my own father

719
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:16,860
to the police station.

720
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:20,860
I didn't sleep all night.

721
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:25,380
This is something
so obviously wrong.

722
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,280
Is there really no place in the world
where someone will listen to reason?

723
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,300
The police said

724
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,950
that if this happens again,

725
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:36,910
we mustn't let it slide.
That we need to report it right away

726
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:38,470
and get legal help.

727
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:43,070
I hate my dad.

728
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:46,070
I hate that he does nothing

729
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:48,260
but hurt me and my mom.

730
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:53,110
But right now,

731
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:56,260
I hate myself even more.

732
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:30,160
♪Maybe♪

733
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:37,420
