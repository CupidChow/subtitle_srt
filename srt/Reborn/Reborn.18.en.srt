(Adapted from the serialized work "Reborn"
by Qiang Yu)

15
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:37,270
There's something

16
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:39,430
that stood out.

17
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:42,660
Our department received a pack of cash.

18
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,070
It was designated as payment
for Tan Qianqian's bill.

19
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,940
But we have no idea who sent it.

20
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,100
Ms. Yanqiu,

21
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,550
about this conversation...

22
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:58,550
Don't let your father know.

23
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:59,020
Yes.

24
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,190
I know.

25
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:00,860
Yeah.

26
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,150
Ming Sheng,

27
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:10,150
you're a lot like your father.

=Episode 18=
(I Lied. I Have an Umbrella)

29
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,830
Didn't bring an umbrella?

30
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,300
Yeah.

31
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,300
You?

32
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:01,830
Me neither.

33
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,180
How have you been lately?

34
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,620
I'm doing pretty well.

35
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,180
I made it into the top 50
in the grade this time,

36
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,460
and I made some new friends too.

37
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:17,340
And you?

38
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,860
I heard about your father.

39
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:24,900
It's just a medical dispute.

40
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,550
Not the first time either.

41
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:27,830
It's no big deal.

42
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:31,270
That's good to hear.

43
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,270
- How have you...
- How have you...

44
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:45,060
I'm applying to
the University of Paris Medical School.

45
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,740
I'll be focusing all my effort

46
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,510
on preparing to study abroad.

47
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:53,430
Probably won't be coming
to school anymore.

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,740
This might be the last time
we see each other.

49
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,180
Don't you have anything
you want to say to me?

50
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,060
All the best.

51
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,150
The rain has lightened.
I'll head home now.

52
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:25,150
Wait.

53
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:33,980
I lied.

54
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:36,660
I have an umbrella.

55
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,950
Since this is the last time we'll meet,

56
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,710
I guess I won't be returning
what I borrowed.

57
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,070
So, thanks but no thanks.

58
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:25,980
Silly girl.

59
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,340
Always so absent-minded.

60
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,100
Never thinks things through.

61
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:32,340
Never know what you're really thinking.

62
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:39,900
Yes.

63
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,510
You and Mumu are good friends.

64
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,900
Her dad is sick, you should visit.

65
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,900
But one visit is enough.

66
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,070
Going there again and again.

67
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,150
That's a hospital.

68
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,220
You could spend that time
doing more practice papers.

69
00:05:53,425 --> 00:05:55,275
(999 Cold Remedy Granular)

70
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,270
Poor Mumu.

71
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,460
Out of all times her dad could get sick,

72
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,900
it had to be during her final year.

73
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,390
This will derail her.

74
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:12,870
Mom,
how much do you think a life is worth?

75
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:14,870
100,000? 200,000?

76
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:15,980
300,000?

77
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,070
Or is it different
depending on the person?

78
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,100
How much is my life worth?

79
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:23,100
How much is Qiao Beiyu's life worth?

80
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:32,510
Two years ago,

81
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,520
I ran into Qiao Beiyu

82
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,420
when I came to Huanzhou
to bring you clothes.

83
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,830
She told me...

84
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,660
I'll give you back your parents, okay?

85
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,190
Has she known since then

86
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:49,270
that her family
had already given up on her?

87
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:55,870
Drink this while it's hot,

88
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:57,660
and get some rest.

89
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:08,460
Mom.

90
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,190
What are you doing up here?

91
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,820
Come and eat.

92
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,420
I'll take you to school today.

93
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:57,820
Where's Mom?

94
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:02,300
Something came up at the shop.

95
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,150
She needed to be there earlier.

96
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,110
Dad.

97
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,870
Don't you think
Mom's been acting strange?

98
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,540
Last night,

99
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,470
I saw her standing alone on the rooftop.

100
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,700
I think she was sleepwalking.

101
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,020
Sleepwalking?

102
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,590
She's just getting older.

103
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:19,630
Menopause.

104
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,110
Can't sleep well.

105
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,350
It's not the first time.

106
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:23,780
She did that in Nanqiao Village too.

107
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,230
Enough.

108
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:28,120
Don't overthink.

109
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,150
Hurry up and eat.
You're going to be late for school.

110
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:32,660
Eat.

111
00:09:48,037 --> 00:09:52,875
(Huanzhou High School)

112
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,270
Lately,

113
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:06,300
I keep dreaming about things
from my childhood.

114
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,150
My dad was really good to me.

115
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,780
He'd cook delicious food,

116
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,110
tell me stories,

117
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:19,020
let me ride on his shoulders
at lantern festivals.

118
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,820
Me, my dad, and mom,

119
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:25,630
we were really happy together.

120
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,270
I think

121
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:34,300
she must remember all that too.

122
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,630
That's why she's endured him

123
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:38,110
for all those years.

124
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:45,750
Back then,

125
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:48,120
my dad was a math teacher at Huanzhou

126
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,660
No. 1 Experimental Elementary School.

127
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:52,350
He was funny and charismatic.

128
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,900
He won the "Outstanding Teacher" award
every year.

129
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,870
All the students loved him.

130
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:00,630
Until one time...

131
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:03,470
A classmate from kindergarten
threw a birthday party.

132
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:08,540
It was my first time
attending a birthday party.

133
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,700
Looking back,

134
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:16,230
everything that happened that day
felt like a fairytale.

135
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,060
I had never seen

136
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,390
such a beautiful princess dress,

137
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,990
or eaten such tasty ice cream.

138
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:30,270
When I got home, I clung to my dad.

139
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:32,780
I said, "Daddy! Daddy!

140
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,300
I want to live in a big house too!

141
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,540
I want to wear pretty clothes too!

142
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:45,470
Why aren't we rich like the others?"

143
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:53,700
Do you think

144
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:56,180
my dad gave up his stable job

145
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,630
as a teacher and went into business

146
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:00,700
because of what I said?

147
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,750
If it weren't for me,

148
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,990
maybe he wouldn't have
failed in business.

149
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,470
Wouldn't have borrowed loan sharks.

150
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,420
Wouldn't have become an alcoholic.

151
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:14,020
Wouldn't have turned out like this.

152
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,700
No. Those are just your assumptions.

153
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,590
But what if it is true?

154
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:39,180
Mumu, no one can change

155
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,660
another person's destiny that easily.

156
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:44,590
And you should never punish yourself
for someone else's mistakes.

157
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,590
Dribble once and you'll get past. Try.

158
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,780
See? Told you.

159
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,180
I told you I can't dribble.

161
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,390
Not bad.

00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,280
Seriously, Sheng?

163
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,060
You called us out at noon
to play basketball,

164
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,470
and you're just sitting here

165
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:32,760
staring at that piece of paper?

166
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,350
What are you thinking about?

167
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,180
Sigh.

168
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:39,750
I just have this feeling
that money the hospital received

169
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,870
has something to do
with that patient's husband.

170
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:43,750
I got their home number,

171
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,820
but they refused to say anything.

172
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,990
That is weird.

173
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,780
Paying off the hospital's bill

174
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,350
while also demanding compensation.

175
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,750
That's contradictory.

176
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,420
You even got the family's phone number?

177
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:55,630
No problem then.

178
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,820

188
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,350
What do you want now?

189
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,470
Do me a favor.

(Huanzhou Association of AIDS Prevention
and Control)

192
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:34,660
Hello.

193
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,230
Hi, I'm Fangfang.

194
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:38,300
I'm a volunteer.

195
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,180
What's your name?

196
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:40,590
Qiao Qingyu.

197
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,780
Qiao Qingyu.

198
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:43,180
I'll call you Qingyu, then.

199
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,700
Is this your first time here?

200
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:48,110
Don't be shy.

201
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:50,270
Everyone who comes here is someone
in need of help.

202
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,780
Admitting that you need help

203
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,540
is the first step toward healing.

204
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,900
You've got it wrong.

205
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,350
I'm not...

206
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,150
Don't worry.

207
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,660
The identity of anyone seeking help

208
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,870
is kept strictly confidential.

209
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:04,020
Fangfang.

210
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:06,780
She's a student of mine.

211
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:12,660
Follow me.

212
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,350
Our organization is made up

213
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,780
of AIDS prevention workers

214
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:20,540
and volunteers from all walks of life.

215
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,150
We serve as a bridge

216
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:24,020
between the government and society

217
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,150
to support AIDS prevention.

218
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:26,700
Currently,

219
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,420
we have over

220
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,940
130 registered volunteers.

221
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,750
They all have full-time jobs,

222
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,420
but still take time

223
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,180
to go around the country

224
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:37,060
doing AIDS awareness work.

225
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:40,390
We also provide
post-exposure consultations

226
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,820
to help people minimize

227
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,300
their risk of infection.

228
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:45,820
Besides that,

229
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,230
we also hold free public seminars

230
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:49,420
on AIDS prevention every Saturday.

231
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:49,990
This way.

232
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:52,660
AIDS is a chronic disease.

233
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:55,270
Once the HIV virus
enters the human body,

234
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:57,940
if no intervention
or treatment is given,

235
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:01,020
life expectancy is about ten years.

236
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:03,940
(AIDS Awareness Seminar)
Once symptoms appear, without treatment,

237
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,550
the patient may die

238
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:07,590
within 12 to 18 months.

239
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:08,980
AIDS

240
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,790
is a highly dangerous infectious disease

241
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,980
caused by the HIV virus.

242
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:15,180
It attacks

243
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,740
the human immune system.

244
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,350
Thank you for today, Dr. Zhang.

245
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:24,680
Just doing my duty.

246
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,240
This is Dr. Zhang Xiaohui
from the Infectious Diseases Department.

247
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:27,630
Like me,

248
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,350
he is also a volunteer
with our organization.

249
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,070
This is my student, Qiao Qingyu.

250
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:31,870
Hello.

251
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,460
Qingyu has some questions
she would like to ask.

252
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:35,830
You two go ahead and talk.

253
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,310
Dr. Zhang,

254
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:43,480
if an infected person is diagnosed early

255
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,900
and takes their medication regularly
during the early stage,

256
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,790
what could cause their condition

257
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:49,700
to worsen drastically

258
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:51,220
in a short time,

259
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:52,500
even resulting in death?

260
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:55,260
Generally,

261
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:57,550
in such cases, the patient's lifespan

262
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:58,870
can be significantly extended.

263
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:01,500
Sudden death is very unlikely.

264
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,790
This patient's death

265
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,420
might have other causes.

266
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:11,180
Are you saying
it might not have been due to AIDS?

267
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,030
You're back.

268
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:21,220
I came back to get some clothes.

269
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:24,070
Are those dirty clothes in that bag?

270
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:26,310
Leave them here. I'll wash them for you.

271
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,460
You're brushing its fur?

272
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,390
Mm. Giving it a little grooming.

273
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,590
You take care of this dog

274
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,390
with more patience

275
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:35,790
than you ever had for me as a kid.

276
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:38,590
Do you know why?

277
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,830
Because it's cuter than you.

278
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:41,350
Tch.

279
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:45,900
I heard the mediation

280
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:50,590
for your medical dispute is scheduled
for next week.

281
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,590
Mm. Don't worry about that.

282
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,740
Your job right now is to study hard

283
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:57,740
and pass

284
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,180
the language exam.

285
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,310
As if I care.

286
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:04,870
Do you regret it?

287
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,310
Regret what?

288
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,220
Treating that patient.

289
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,220
No.

290
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,390
If I have to face
the same situation again,

291
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,740
I will still make the same decision.

292
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:27,870
Did you buy that outfit for the dog?

293
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,790
Of course.

294
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,040
Such a cute puppy.

295
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,420
Ruined by your poor fashion taste.

296
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:36,350
So ugly.

297
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:39,900
Hey, puppy,
my dad says you're cuter than me.

298
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:41,390
Is that true?

299
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:47,980
Ew. You smell.

300
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,740
Give it to me.

301
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:50,590
Come here.

302
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:42,980
Mom, why aren't you guys home yet?

303
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:44,500
Qingyu, it's me.

304
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,980
Mom is in the hospital!

305
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:46,940
What?

306
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,520
You should probably take turns

307
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,350
watching over the patient tonight
in case of any unexpected complications.

308
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,350
Dad, what happened?

309
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,660
Why did Mom suddenly fall ill?

310
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,600
The patient's vital signs are stable.

311
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,980
Her condition is under control.

312
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:01,900
This episode was triggered

313
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,740
by an overdose of paroxetine.

314
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,700
As her family,
you must monitor her carefully,

315
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:09,150
especially with medication dosage.

316
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,390
What's paroxetine?

317
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:11,940
Why would she be taking paroxetine?

318
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,900
You don't know?

319
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:17,460
Paroxetine is an antidepressant.

320
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:19,660
She has depression.

321
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,070
I got you the medicine.

322
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:22,900
Take them on time.

323
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:23,200
Got it.

324
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,040
Don't let the back and shoulder pain
come back.

325
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,590
Got it.

326
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:29,700
Depression...

327
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,310
Dad.

328
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:24,180
Did you know Mom was sick

329
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,900
all along?

330
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,390
That bottle of painkillers

331
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,420
is filled with paroxetine.

332
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,660
That's a medication for depression.

333
00:22:45,037 --> 00:22:46,650
(Painkillers)

334
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:49,310
She always said her shoulder hurt.

335
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,790
That was a symptom
caused by the depression.

336
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,070
Since when?

337
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:02,590
It started not long after Bei passed.

338
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,870
Right after the 15th day
of the first lunar month.

339
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,420
You and Yu were still in Shunyun.

340
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:15,110
Your mom and I brought Bei's ashes back

341
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:17,940
to Nanqiao Village.

342
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,150
Beiyu,

343
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:45,940
do you hate me and your dad?

344
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:48,830
If I were you,

345
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:51,830
seeing your own parents

346
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,390
have more kids,

347
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:58,310
raise them at home,

348
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:03,460
and leave you with your grandparents,

349
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,350
that would mean

350
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:08,630
they didn't think you mattered at all,

351
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:09,500
right?

352
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:13,220
If you didn't matter,

353
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:16,700
then no matter what you said or did,

354
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,500
it wouldn't make a difference

355
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,180
to them.

356
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:25,980
Was that what you thought?

357
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,310
Go to sleep.

358
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:38,740
She's gone.

359
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,550
You can't keep doing this, Fanghao.

360
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,460
We have to go on.

361
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,350
We still have Qingyu and Yu.

362
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:51,900
We have to keep going.

363
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:55,110
Be strong.

364
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,310
Let's sleep.

365
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:08,310
Her grandparents refused to let her
be buried in the ancestral tomb.

366
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:10,700
Your big brother and I

367
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:12,660
had to convince them

368
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:15,110
to let you guys do this.

369
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,830
But her grandfather had one condition.

370
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:20,360
He'd allow her
to be buried in the tomb,

371
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:23,260
but there should be no gravestone.

372
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:24,870
That's a given.

373
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,900
Putting up a gravestone
would just invite ridicule.

374
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:28,790
Say less.

375
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,030
Fanghao!

376
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:43,550
Fanghao!

377
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:51,590
Fanghao!

378
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,660
Fanghao!

379
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:06,070
Fanghao...

380
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,630
What are you doing out here

381
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:13,870
in the middle of the night?

382
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,500
Get up.

383
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,390
Come on.

384
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,500
You'll freeze out here.

385
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,180
Come on!

386
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,030
What is it?

387
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:29,030
- Don't do that.
- I want to sleep.

388
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:30,390
Let me go!

389
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,390
Cut it out!

390
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,030
Bei's gone.

391
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:35,030
She's dead!

392
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:35,980
She's cold.

393
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,220
Let's go home, okay?

394
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,870
Let me rest...

395
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,790
That was when
I sensed something was wrong.

396
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,260
After we returned to Shunyun,

397
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,700
I took her to the hospital.

398
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:30,900
Mrs. Qiao.

399
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,600
The doctor needs to speak
with your husband.

400
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,150
Let me take you to get the medication.

401
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,030
Follow me.

402
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:40,110
Your wife

403
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:42,310
is currently experiencing
mild depressive disorder.

404
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:44,790
(Psychiatry Clinic Room 1)
Symptoms include low mood,

405
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:47,150
self-blame, slowed movements,

406
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,420
loss of interest,

407
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:50,870
and reduced energy.

408
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:54,180
Sometimes, it also manifests

409
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,660
as physical symptoms

410
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:58,900
such as sleep disorders, weight loss,

411
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,590
or body pain.

412
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:02,460
As her family,

413
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:05,150
it is vital that you monitor
her medication schedule.

414
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:07,310
But even more important is
to accept her condition

415
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,790
and emotions.

416
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,110
Be there for her.

417
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:11,740
Avoid criticizing her.

418
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,070
Don't trigger her.

419
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:14,980
Use encouragement and support.

420
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,260
Depression is an illness.

421
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:20,550
Understanding and companionship
are essential.

422
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,310
Do you understand?

423
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:21,940
Yes.

424
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:24,830
I'll write down some things

425
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:25,980
to note.

426
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,260
Make sure you memorize them.

427
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,900
Your mother has her pride.

428
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,350
She doesn't want you two to worry.

429
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:34,110
So,

430
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:35,790
just pretend you don't know about this.

431
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:08,790
Hey, lad.

432
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:11,180
Is this your first time here?

433
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:11,980
Yes.

434
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:14,550
Are you here for sightseeing

435
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:15,980
or visiting relatives?

436
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:17,830
Neither.

437
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:19,150
I'm here to find someone.

438
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:20,260
By yourself?

439
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:23,310
Wow, young people these days
are really something.

440
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:32,700
Are you sure the person
you're looking for is here?

441
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,550
Sure you have the right address?

442
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:37,180
This is the place.

443
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,550
Just drop me off there.

444
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:49,180
Okay.

445
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:55,030
Thanks.

446
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:58,070
Take care of yourself, young man.

447
00:30:58,150 --> 00:30:59,500
I will. Thanks.

448
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:06,420
Excuse me.

449
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,150
Who are you looking for?

450
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:10,660
I'd like to see this person.

451
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,390
Is this the right place?

452
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:19,460
He's over there.

453
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:20,550
I'll take you to him.

454
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,550
Thank you.

455
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:27,260
Come here.

456
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:32,150
Thanks.

457
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:42,150
My name is Ming Sheng.

458
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:44,870
I'm the son of Ming Qiuxin
from Huanzhou People's Hospital.

459
00:31:45,287 --> 00:31:48,987
(Huanzhou People's Mediation Committee
for Medical Disputes)

460
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,790
The mediation panel
and the patient's family have arrived.

461
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:07,390
What should I do?

462
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:11,220
We hope you can offer

463
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:13,790
a short apology

464
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:16,550
to the patient's family.

465
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:20,310
I've written out the suggested wording
for the apology.

466
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:21,550
Please have a look.

467
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:35,630
With things escalating this far,

468
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:39,150
unless the patient's family voluntarily
withdraws their complaint

469
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:40,740
and apologizes to us instead,

470
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:44,350
Dr. Ming is inevitably going
to face consequences.

471
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:47,790
We want to minimize the damage.

472
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:50,220
Okay.

473
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,310
I understand.

474
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:54,630
It's almost time.

475
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:55,550
Let's go in.

476
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:56,900
All right.

477
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:04,590
Dr. Ming. Dr. Ming!

478
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,590
You're Tan Qianqian's husband.

479
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,790
Dr. Ming, I...

480
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,550
I'm so sorry.

481
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:20,030
No hospital in our county or Huanzhou

482
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:22,420
would accept my wife.

483
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,180
One after another, they all told us
to go home and wait it out.

484
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:28,700
Only you were willing
to take the risk for us

485
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:31,030
and give us hope.

486
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:34,980
Before the surgery, my wife told me,

487
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:37,630
no matter whether she lived or died,

488
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:39,590
you would always be our benefactor.

489
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,550
After she passed,

490
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:45,220
I couldn't pay the medical bills.

491
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,180
I was so ashamed
I could not face anyone.

492
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:49,630
I ran off to another city to work,

493
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,790
hoping to repay the debt sooner.

494
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:53,660
I...

495
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,030
I never expected my family

496
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:57,830
would do such a thing.

497
00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:59,660
I may not be well-educated,

498
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,040
but even I know

499
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,440
that there's no such thing
as repaying kindness with betrayal.

500
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,900
Rest assured, Dr. Ming.

501
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:09,740
I'm here to withdraw the complaint.

502
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,260
I won't let you suffer
any more injustice.

503
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:38,700
Your language teacher complained.

504
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,300
Said you haven't attended class
for days in a row.

505
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:51,740
They're just teaching things

506
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:52,700
I already know.

507
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:58,150
I thought you ran off to look
for the patient's family.

508
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,300
So you knew.

509
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:05,780
Thank you, Sheng.

510
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:07,740
Don't thank me.

511
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:10,380
I don't care for your thanks.

512
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,550
I still want to thank you.

513
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,860
How did you even find the place?

514
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:23,400
When you were little,
once you ran away from home

515
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,880
after arguing with your grandfather.

516
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,860
You fell asleep right under
this banyan tree.

517
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:29,700
I was the one who carried you back.

518
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:33,740
I always thought it was Grandpa.

519
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:36,150
Why didn't you ever tell me?

520
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:49,660
You were always a handful,
even as a kid.

521
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,630
Always finding new ways
to wear out the adults.

522
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:52,660
Oh, please.

523
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:55,260
You were barely ever home.

524
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,160
I barely even saw you.

525
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,240
When did I ever have the time
to be a handful to you?

526
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:05,470
There was this one time.
I had a full day of surgeries.

527
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:08,430
My back was killing me.

528
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:09,780
I just wanted to lie down.

529
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:12,470
I came home, pulled the blanket back,

530
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:16,220
and found the whole bed soaking wet
with instant noodles.

531
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,860
I was furious.

532
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:20,180
I decided then and there.

533
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:22,700
No cartoons for a month for you.

534
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:26,110
You cried like the world

535
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,630
was ending.

536
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,030
Do you still remember that?

537
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,430
Of course.

538
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:40,110
You came home late that night.

539
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,180
I was worried you'd be hungry,

540
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,590
so I made the last cup
of instant noodles

541
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:45,470
we had

542
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:47,030
and left it for you.

543
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:50,110
But even when
I was about to fall asleep,

544
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:51,220
you still hadn't come back.

545
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,700
I didn't want the noodles to get cold,

546
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:57,340
so I tucked them under the blanket.

547
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:00,910
I was crying

548
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,030
not because I was throwing a tantrum,

549
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:06,510
but because I felt wronged.

550
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:15,220
You never

551
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:19,070
told me that.

552
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,380
Well, now you know.

553
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:26,430
Mm.

554
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:30,860
Now I know.

555
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,630
Did you hear?

556
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:49,510
That medical dispute
involving Ming Sheng's dad?

557
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:51,640
Not only did the patient's family
withdraw the complaint,

558
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,960
they even issued a public apology.

559
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,300
For real? That's a big 180 they did.

560
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:57,030
Qingyu, you're close to Ming Sheng.

561
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:58,340
Do you know anything about it?

562
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:01,340
We're not that close.

563
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:05,590
Oh, please. Even the blind can tell

564
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:07,780
Ming Sheng sees you
as more than a regular classmate.

565
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:10,990
I'm surprised you aren't...

566
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:12,820
That I'm not upset?

567
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:17,220
I have an announcement.

568
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,740
I have a new goal now.

569
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:20,300
I want to focus on my studies.

570
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:20,780
Tch.

571
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:22,910
I bet that won't even last six months.

572
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:25,280
Qingyu,
let's go to the library together.

573
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,840
Maybe next time. I have something to do.

574
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,510
"Maybe next time.
I have something to do."

575
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:31,440
We'll go to the library.

These are some photos

591
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:20,160
Just pick the ones
that match the content

592

and stick them on.

593
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:21,660
Got it.

594
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,110

598
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:06,300
When I saw

599
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:09,660
your name at school, I wondered

600
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:11,110
if you might be

601
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:13,550
Qiao Beiyu's sister.

602
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:17,590
Ms. Le Fan, you knew Qiao Beiyu?

603
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,780
We often did AIDS awareness campaigns
through the association.

604
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:25,660
That was how I met Beiyu.

605
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:27,820
Whenever we were around,

606
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,070
she was always there.

607
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:30,030
Dr. Le Fan.

608
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,740
Beiyu, you're here.

609
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:32,150
Yes.

610
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,550
Sorry. I need to take this call.

611

She always worked hard with us,

612
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:36,820
helping others.

613
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:38,180
Until that day...

614
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:38,990
Hello?

615
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:40,700
Qiao Beiyu?

616
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:43,590
It's been a while. Did you miss me?

617

Dr. Le Fan.

619
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:56,950
I have to go.

620
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:03,260
Not long after,
I heard something had happened to her.

621
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:07,510
I often wonder

622
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:09,740
if things would have been different

623
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:13,590
if I had called out to her back then.

624
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:17,110
Ms. Le Fan.

625
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:20,030
Do you know how Qiao Beiyu died?

626
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:31,430
You have no idea how sudden it all was.

627

Around noon,

628
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:34,040

Said they wanted us
to go back for a visit.

630
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:38,030
Said they understood
that Mom and Dad had it tough.

631
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:40,590
We're still family.

632
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:41,660
Let the past be the past.

633
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,470
Ms. Qiao Qingyu.

634
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:46,300
I'm telling you this.

635
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:47,380
I'm done.

636
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:49,260
I'm not covering for you anymore.

637
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:52,430
You can't bribe me with allowance.

638
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,990
What you're offering is nowhere

639
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:56,030
near enough for the emotional damage.
