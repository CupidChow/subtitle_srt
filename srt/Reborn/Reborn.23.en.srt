to the girls' dorm entrance right now.

Don't be afraid. It's not your fault.

That's right.

53
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,390
He was harassing her.

54
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,460
Fine, I'll delete it.

55
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:22,740

A buffer

69
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:55,110
will help them settle in.

70
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,830
It'll be difficult

71
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:58,950

formal therapy sessions otherwise.

74
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:07,430
strike up a conversation

75
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,390
or encourage them to browse

76
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:14,150

81
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,900

84

used in therapy.

90
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,710
Such as exposure therapy,

91
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,540

I'm fine. I'm all better now.

102
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,900
The doctor said you should relax

103
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:30,870
and get out more.

104
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:31,630
Mm.

105
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,510
We've been here so long,

running around every day,

107
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,830
but we've never gone anywhere
as a family.

108
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,780

109

Really?

111
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:42,830
Sounds good.

112
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,510
Take me to the park.

I never knew

116
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,540
there was such a big park around here.

117
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,710
You used to have too much
to worry about.

118
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,980
I worried about all the wrong things.

119
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:18,580

This way.

122
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:26,980
You said your roommate
lost all her money

123
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,270
in the stock market?

124
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,390
Yeah.

125
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,840
The funniest part is,

126
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,950
she used the method
our securities professor taught us.

127
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:35,150
And he just shrugged
and said she was unlucky.

128
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,220
Back in my day,

129
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,830
we called it "work-study."

130
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,710
We made matchboxes

131
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:43,390
and picked tea leaves.

136
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,390
Not at all.

137
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,630
I get to do what I enjoy,

138
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,070
learn a lot,

139
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,870
and earn a bit on the side.

140
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:05,710
It's great.

So many classes,

144
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,710
and still taking on a job.

145
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,460
Don't push yourself too hard.

146
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,540
We're fine financially.

147
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,630
Keep the money you earn.

148
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:21,190
Stop sending it home.

149
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,510
Close your eyes.

150
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,220
I have something for you.

151
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,630
I bought this with the money you sent.

152
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,660
I didn't spend any of my own.

153
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,460
This must've cost a lot.

154
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:46,750
Not really.

155
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:49,070
You're an adult now.

156
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:52,580
Back when you were in school,
everyone had phones,

157
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:55,270
but we didn't get you one

158
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,580
because we worried it'd distract you.

159
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,220
Now you're grown up.

160
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,870
You should have your own phone.

161
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,070
Just make sure to call me often.

162
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,270
Look at them.

163
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,420
Let's go shopping later.

164
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,340
All dressed up.

165
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,680
Don't just bury your head in the books.

166
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,630
It's time you learned
to take care of yourself too.

167
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:20,870
Right?

168
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,950
A young lady should look
like a young lady.

169
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,020
Let's go.

170
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:38,500
(Xingzhou)

171
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:45,020
Mom.

172
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,870
This is the pearl hairclip you gave me.

173
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,420
I think you should keep it.

174
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:49,990
Okay.

175
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,390
Just leave it in my room.

176
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,660
I'll put it on for you.

177
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:53,590
What?

178
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:53,820
Here.

179
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:54,940
You want me to wear it?

180
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,300
Don't move.

181
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,390
It suits you perfectly.

182
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,630
If you say so.

183
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:02,590
Dinner's ready!

184
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:03,230
Coming.

185
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:04,390
Come on.

186
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,350
Coming.

187
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,630
You wanted hot pot.

188
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,510
These are all your favorites.

189
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,590
Should I say something?

190
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:24,350

244
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:49,150
(that severely disrupted others' lives.)

245
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,820
(Given the severity
of the circumstances,)

246
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,280
(the People's Court convicted him)

286
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:21,870
I asked if the food was too spicy.

287
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:25,700
He nodded at first.

288
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:28,660
He looked like he didn't want to talk.

289
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:33,110
Then he muttered something.

290
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:35,750
Couldn't hear clearly,

291
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:44,820
but I think he said something
about "can't forget"?

00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:07,660

293
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:09,700

00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:30,900

296
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,460
Yes.

297
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:36,500
I see. Don't do it again.

298
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:41,390

When we first moved to Huanzhou,

303
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:47,900
it was only this big.

304
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,260
You even said it was dead.

305
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,660
Look at it now. It's thriving.

306
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:54,940
Just leave it be.

307
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:56,260
I know, I know.

308
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,660
They're your precious plants.

309
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,550

310
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,940
That's right. Hands off.

311
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:03,500
The kids are all grown up.

312
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:07,150
It's time for us to take a step back.

313
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:10,180
Especially after Yu finishes his NCEE.

314
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,870
It'll just be
the two of us left at home.

315
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,350
We'll finally get to relax.

316
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,110

317

when we first got married,

318
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,180
you said you wanted to travel.

319
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,260
Where did you want to go?

320
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:25,350

00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,390
Well, we've got the time now.

324
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,460

you've saved up the money.

332
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,740

Have it.

336
00:19:13,912 --> 00:19:17,512
(Jiangzhou University)

337
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,980
Today, I want to introduce

338
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,900
a common literary technique.

339
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:27,790
Using scenery to reflect emotion.

340
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,760
It refers to when the author,
carrying intense personal feelings,

341
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:34,360
describes the external environment

342
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:39,220
projecting their inner emotions
into what they see.

343
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,590
The emotion gives rise to the imagery,

344
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,500
and the imagery gives rise
to the emotion.

345
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:46,870
Let me give an example.
A great writer once asked his students

346
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:49,420
to translate a short passage.

347
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:52,260
It's a scene where the male lead,
walking under the moonlight

348
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,870
with the female lead,
can't help but say,

349
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,460
"I love you."

350
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,630
Most students

351
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:00,900
simply translated it literally.

352
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,630
But the writer said

353
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:06,030
it should be more subtle.

354
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,830
Anyone know

355
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,940
how he translated it?

356
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:12,790
Qiao Qingyu, let's hear your take.

357
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:15,790
Professor,
you picked the wrong person to ask.

358
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,940
Qiao Qingyu has no romantic experience.

359
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,420
The writer believed a direct translation
lacked sophistication.

360
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,630
"I love you" should be translated as,
"The moon is beautiful tonight."

361
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:29,900
Subtle, poetic, and moving.

362
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,070
The affection is expressed

363
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,830
through the moonlight
they bask in together.

364
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,500
Excellent. Very well said.

365
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,180
You may sit down.

366
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:41,260
Qiao Qingyu,

367
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:43,500
look at the moon.

368
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,070
It's beautiful tonight.

369
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,500
It is.

370
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:54,980
Let's sleep.

371
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:05,310
Qiao Qingyu,

372
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,030
the moon

373
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,590
is beautiful tonight.

374
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,460
Check my hair. How do I look?

375
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:24,420
Perfect. You've got this.

376
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:25,630
Good luck.

377
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:26,790
You can do it!

378
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,350
Qiao Qingyu!

379
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:35,030
Qiao Qingyu!

380
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,900
The moon is beautiful tonight.

381
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,180
Let's check it out! Come on!

382
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:43,460
Qiao Qingyu,

383
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,980
the moon is beautiful tonight.

384
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:48,980
Ugh, that line again?

385
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,660
Qiao Qingyu said

386
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:52,590
the moon is beautiful,

387
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:55,150
but it's got nothing to do with you.

388
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,260
That's harsh.

389
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:58,830
It's okay, man.

390
00:21:58,830 --> 00:21:59,500
It's all right.

391
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,390
You'll find the one for you.

392
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:04,790
Qingyu,

393
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,500
do you know
who that was downstairs just now?

394
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:08,830
That was Chen Ziyun,
heartthrob of the graduate school.

395
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,700
His dad's a professor in our faculty.

396
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:13,070
He has a good background.

397
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:14,660
Why don't you give him a shot?

398
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:15,940
I bet

399
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:18,420
Qingyu already likes someone.

400
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:21,310
She's turned down lots of guys.

401
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:23,790
Maybe she's been hurt before?

402
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:25,660
Tell us your story, Qingyu.

403
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:26,390
That reminds me.

404
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:28,260
You always run off to the lighthouse.

405
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,900
Are you waiting for someone?

406
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:34,590
You're a beautiful girl.

407
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:36,480
Don't waste your youth.

408
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,830
Maybe you can take
some of those guys off Qingyu's hands.

409
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,675
(Qingyu, Sheng)

410
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,550
(Sheng: Qiao Qingyu,
good luck on the NCEE!)

411
00:22:55,551 --> 00:22:57,280
(Hope all three
of your wishes come true!)

412
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:29,500
Miss.

413
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:30,830
Your coffee.

414
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,110
There's something I need to tell you.

415
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:36,940
The café will be moving

416
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,700
to Huancheng South Road soon.

417
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:39,900
That's a bit sudden.

418
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,310
We didn't have a choice.

419
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:43,220
This whole area is being redeveloped.

420
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,740
You're our regular,

421
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,220
so I thought you should know.

422
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,980
You've been coming here once or twice

423
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,660
every month for the past six months.

424
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:54,350
I think you mentioned

425
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:55,740
that you're waiting for someone?

426
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:00,350
Yes.

427
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,660
Well, I hope your wish comes true.

428
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,390
The coffee's on the house.

429
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:05,390
Enjoy.

430
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:21,685
(Make A Wish Upon The Sea Breeze,
We'll Meet Again By The River And Sea.)

431
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:28,790
Qiao Qingyu,

432
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:30,420
I'm keeping this.

433
00:24:58,630 --> 00:24:59,940
For you, Ms. Wang.

434
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:03,180
Stop teasing me.

435
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,600
I'm just a new intern assistant.

436
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,700
I came along with the team
for the academic exchange.

437
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,600
Figured I'd take the chance
to catch up with you.

438
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,590
Still tastes like my childhood.

439
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,630
Do you ever think about those days?

440
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:27,740
I don't know, honestly.

441
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:33,110
Back then, all I could think about was

442
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,590
when can I finally leave home,

443
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,700
when can I finally grow up?

444
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:41,870
Now I've outgrown
the troubles of being 18

445
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:44,350
only to have the problems of being 20.

446
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:47,740
I remember back in high school,

447
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,980
we used to ask each other
the same question.

448
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,180
"Does it get better when we grow up?"

449
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:54,900
I saw a movie.

450
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:56,870
A little girl asked an adult

451
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:57,830
that same question.

452
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,150
"Will things get better when I grow up?"

453
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:01,940
The adult replied,

454
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,550
"No. Life is always like this."

455
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:09,220
He's right. Life is always like this.

456
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,740
But the good thing is

457
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,220
we've gotten stronger.

458
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:14,070
Yeah.

459
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,920
All right, enough about the past.

460
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,550
Let's talk about
what's bothering you now.

461
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:19,740
I bet

462
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:22,260
your line of admirers stretches
all the way to the campus gate.

463
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:23,870
Quit messing with me.

464
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:25,260
What about you?

465
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:27,980
Me? I'm married to my job.

466
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:31,900
Oh, right.

467
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,220
Let me take you somewhere.

468
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:34,830
Follow me.

00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:06,220
Thank you.

473
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:14,870
Thank you.

474
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,630
Can I have a handshake, Ms. Anna?

475
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:25,390
Of course.

476
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:26,310
Thank you.

477
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,030
Thank you.

(Anna's Musical Path Signing Event)

479
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:38,260
That's Ming Sheng's mom.

480
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,740
Mr. Ming gave me tickets to the event.

481
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:47,660
She probably knows
what's going on with him.

482
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:50,790
Can I take a photo with you, Ms. Anna?

483
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:51,550
Sure.

484
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:03,260
Aren't you even a little curious
about Ming Sheng?

485
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,900
What's the point?

486
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,220
It's all in the past.

487
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,260
Do you really believe that back then,

488
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:17,180
when he rescued you from the snowstorm

489
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:18,740
and planned to run away with you,

490
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,030
it was all just because
you were classmates?

491
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:30,700
Growing up means accepting

492
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,150
the things we can't change

493
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:35,070
and also choosing
to change the things we can't accept.

494
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:39,350
I heard Ming Sheng's been helping

495
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,590
his mom prepare for her concert.

496
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:43,590

Yes.

507
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:19,310
Guess what I wished for.

508
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:22,030
For my first wish,

509
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,150
I hope I can get

510
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:25,630
into the university I want.

511
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:27,500
Second wish,

512
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:28,630
I hope my whole family

513
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:30,390
stays healthy and safe.

514
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:32,870
And the third?

515
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:36,220
I can't tell you. It's a secret.

516
00:31:01,137 --> 00:31:02,962

518
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,700
I still don't get it.

519
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:16,350
We'd been together
since we graduated high school.

520
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,260
Four years.

521
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:20,660
And he broke up with me

522
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,390
just as we're graduating college.

523
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:23,870
I...

524
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:26,550
I just can't let him go.

525
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,420
I can't accept that four years of love

526
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:29,590
just disappeared.

527
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,420
Cry it out.

528
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:35,460
It'll make you feel better.

529
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,460
I tried calling and texting him.

530
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,740
He just won't answer.

531
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:46,550
I feel so lost

532
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,220
without him.

533
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:53,700
If it were you, could you let it go?

534
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:02,150
I don't think you have to let go,
necessarily.

535
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,740
No matter how hard we try,

536
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:06,830
it's difficult to forget the past.

537
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,740
It's part of what makes us who we are.

538
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,700
What we can do is make sure

539
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,420
the past shapes our future

540
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,550
in a positive way.

541
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:18,110
Take the pain

542
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:20,310
and treat it as an experience.

543
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:22,900
There may be regrets, but I'm sure

544
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,940
there were precious moments

545
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,310
between you two as well.

546
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:31,110
Okay.

547
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:33,830

Dr. He.

552
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,940
I've confirmed

553
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:00,260
last month's visitor records.

554
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,550
And I confirmed

555
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:03,310
next week's appointments by phone too.

556
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:05,180
Qingyu,

557
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,550
you'll be starting class again soon.

558

What are your plans for the future?

559
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,080
If you're leaving,

560
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,390
I need to plan for a replacement.

561
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:15,350
I've already thought it through.

562

00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,360
I'm applying
for grad school in psychology.

564
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,280
Someday, I want to go back
to Nanqiao Village

565
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,260
and do counseling

566
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,550
for left-behind children.

567
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:26,420
I'd be happy to have you
if you want to stay.

568
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:29,500
But you're studying finance.
That's a competitive field.

569
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,350
Did you talk this over with your family?

570
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:34,790
It's my decision.

571
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:35,900
My parents support me.

572
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:37,260
Okay, then.

573
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,390
Focus on your prep.

574
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,310
Let me know
if there's anything you need.

575
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:54,240
Please take one.

576
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:54,720
Thank you.

577
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,420
Located on Heping Road, fully renovated.
Connected to two subway lines.

578
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,790
A one-stop shopping center
just a two-minute walk away.

579
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,590
The community also includes
a kindergarten and an elementary school.

580
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:03,310
Do have a look.

581
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,500

(Maybe one day,)

586
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,910
(we'll all be grateful
for the mistakes we once made,)

587
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:28,200
(because they helped us grow.)

588

589

590

Nanqiao Village again someday.)

597
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:49,260

598
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:50,150
