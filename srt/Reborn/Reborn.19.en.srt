=Reborn=

14
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,080
(Adapted from the serialized work "Reborn"
by Qiang Yu)

15
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,380
Qiao Beiyu didn't die from illness.

16
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:39,280
She died by suicide.

17
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,460
The illness was detected early.

18
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:43,830
She followed the treatment plan.

19
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,270
She actually could've lived a long life.

20
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,160
Someone posted her medical info

21
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,380
and personal details online.

22
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:13,710
Hello?

23
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,740
Hello? Beiyu?

24
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:16,990
Who are you looking for?

25
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,340
Is this Qiao Beiyu?

26
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:19,390
Hello?

27
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,710
Who do you want to talk to?

28
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,300
Is this Beiyu's number or not?

29
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:22,920
Wrong number.

30
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,180
The call actually went through.

31
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:25,510
Please stop calling.

32
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:26,740
Just stop calling!

33
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:29,270
Tell Beiyu to pick up.
How did she get sick?

34
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,430
What more do you people want?

35
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,020
I'm begging you.

36
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:33,990
Please, I'm begging.

37
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,780
Please stop calling, okay?

38
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,670
You're heartless.

39
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,020
(After that,)

40
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:44,390
she was bombarded
with messages and calls.

41
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,230
Some creeps used
the chance to harass her.

42
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,460
(Even more were strangers
pretending to be righteous,)

43
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,550
(shaming her
from their moral high ground,)

44
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:53,510
(tearing her down.)

45
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,460
(She dropped out
of Huanzhou Art School.)

46
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,580
(Then, on the night
of Lunar New Year's Eve,)

47
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,430
(she quietly left the hospital.)

48
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,670
Bei...

49
00:05:15,712 --> 00:05:22,737
=Episode 19=
(Beiyu's Camcorder)

50
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:34,420
She...

51
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:37,710
She was always so timid.
Why would she even do that?

52
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,150
Maybe for Qiao Beiyu,

53
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:49,270
the thought of living
scared her more than dying did.

54
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:57,150
Now I understand why our parents thought

55
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,220
keeping quiet and hiding the truth

56
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,870
was the best way to protect us.

57
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:06,070
Because gossip really can kill someone.

58
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:09,950
It killed Qiao Beiyu
right in front of our parents.

59
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,830
(I will find the person
who started those rumors.)

60
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:19,950
(They were the last straw
that pushed Beiyu over the edge.)

61
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,040
Everyone,

62
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,630
before you go, I have something to say.

63
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,240
The entrance exam is in two days.

64
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,580
Our school will be a testing site.

65
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,830
So before you leave today,

66
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,540
make sure the classroom is cleaned up.

67
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,100
Is that clear?

68
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:32,900
Yes.

69
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,830
Take everything out of your desks.

70
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:35,510
Bring it home

71
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,580
or throw it away.

72
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:37,540
And also,

73
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,980
clean off any cheat sheets
or notes written on your desks.

74
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,510
I want them completely gone.

75
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,460
Sir, there aren't any cheat sheets.

76
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,580
Don't accuse us.

77
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:46,710
Ye Zilin,

78
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,310
your desk is covered

79
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,340
in chemistry formulas.

80
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,020
I usually don't say anything

81
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,710
because I want to give you all a break.

82
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:53,510
But now,

83
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,460
you must wipe their desks clean.

84
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,070
Class rep, check the place.

85
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,580
I'll carry out the mission.

86
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:05,630
Qingyu.

87
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,310
This is everything
I've summed up for the exam.

88
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,980
You're giving it all to me?

89
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,220
Take it.

90
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,420
The exam is in two days.

91
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,630
I won't need it anymore.

92
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,460
Keep it and take your time.

93
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:29,980
Thanks.

94
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,020
Qingyu.

95
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,460
I've decided
to get treatment for my dad.

96
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,980
I borrowed money from my aunts.

97
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,310
I signed an IOU.

98
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:50,900
It's a total of 200 grand.

99
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,750
Are you sure about this?

100
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:55,870
Yeah.

101
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,070
I'm doing this

102
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,070
not because of the gossip outside.

103
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,870
It's because I realized...

104
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,270
I still love my dad.

105
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,630
I want to save him.

106
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,580
I don't want to have regrets.

107
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,980
You borrowed money to treat your dad.

108
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,660
Will your mom be okay with that?

109
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,540
Honestly, I don't think my mom

110
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,150
cares that much about the money.

111
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,340
She just doesn't want to burden me.

112
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:35,020
If she were the one who got sick,

113
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,020
she would've chosen
to give up treatment too.

114
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:40,150
Qingyu.

115
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:44,870
I've always admired you and Ming Sheng.

116
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:53,180
You both have the courage
to stand up to the world

117
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,390
and the guts to face the consequences.

118
00:08:58,900 --> 00:08:59,900
From now on,

119
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,660
I want to be someone with courage

120
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:03,820
and responsibility too.

121
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,540
Mom?

122
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,870
Mom, what happened to your foot?

123
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,200
I'm okay. I sprained it a little.

124
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:38,660
Qingyu,

125
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:41,940
that time your mom came
to the hospital to see my mom,

126
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:43,990
she wanted to comfort her,

127
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:46,150
so she talked about the past.

128
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,300
She said after your sister passed away,

129
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:53,180
she almost jumped
out the hospital window.

130
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,820
It's just a small sprain, don't worry.

131
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:58,780
Luckily, two nurses passing
by stopped her.

132
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:00,700
Come on, let's go.

133
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:02,020
Let's get going.

134
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:03,020
Leave it to me.

135
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:05,940
You can't.

136
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:06,990
Can you even ride this?

137
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,350
I'm grown up now.

138
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:11,780
Alright.

139
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,270
There are lots of cars.

140
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:17,660
She also said
if it weren't for you and your brother,

141
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,350
she would've gone with Qiao Beiyu.

142
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:19,820
Sit tight.

143
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,020
Careful, traffic's heavy.

144
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,110
Qingyu,

145
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:26,390
I think maybe
you've misunderstood your mom.

146
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:31,510
I think your mom really,
really loved your sister.

147
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,540
It's just that sometimes,
adults love in ways

148
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:37,990
that are hard to see.

149
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:51,150
Finish your homework after dinner.

150
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,390
Don't wash the dishes.
Just leave them in the sink.

151
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:56,820
I'll clean up when I get back.

152
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,470
Mom, I heard you.

153
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:03,700
Alright.

154
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:12,300
I'm heading back to the shop then.

155
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,470
Where are my keys?

156
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,270
Right here.

157
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:26,270
Oh.

158
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,470
Mom, you don't need
to bring me food anymore.

159
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:35,590
I can cook for myself.

160
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,540
You don't have to
pick me up from school.

161
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,230
If you're worried,

162
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,540
just call the house.

163
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,780
Check if I'm home on time.

164
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,540
I was being immature before.

165
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:47,780
I won't make you worry anymore.

166
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:11,400
(Qiao's Handmade Noodle House)

167
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,870
I think Qing has a point too.

168
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,230
The shop is busy every day,

169
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:32,700
and you still fetch her.

170
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,110
That's exhausting.

171
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:36,660
Yeah, Aunt Fanghao.

172
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,020
It's been a long time
since what happened with Jinrui.

173
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,700
Qing has already learned her lesson.

174
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,020
Didn't you say

175
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,660
she did better on her midterms too?

176
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,820
Hello, Qiao's Noodle Shop.

177
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,150
It's a call from home.

178
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:06,390
Your grandpa fell last night on his way

179
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,270
to the bathroom.

180
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:08,510
He couldn't even stand back up.

181
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,700
And they're short on help right now.

182
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,150
So they want your mom
to go back and help out.

183
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:15,880
But Mom's still sick.

184
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,300
You can't expect someone who's sick

185
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,800
to take care of another patient.

186
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,420
Who's sick?

187
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:20,990
I'm not sick.

188
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,820
I left the money in the small bag.

189
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:25,820
Didn't we agree on this?

190
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:28,080
The old house belongs
to Uncle Haisheng's family,

191
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,150
so he'll be the one
looking after Grandpa and Grandma.

192
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:32,750
Our side and Uncle Jiangsheng's
just pitch in with money.

193
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,180
Why are we giving money
and doing the work now?

194
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,470
You kids don't understand some things.

195
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,700
You can't be
so calculating with families.

196
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,590
If you want fairness,

197
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,780
you caused such a scene back then.

198
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,110
Jinrui even lost his job because of you.

199
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:48,870
To be honest, we still owe them.

200
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:50,940
I just feel like

201
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,780
not going back would be kind of wrong.

202
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,540
And your grandparents say

203
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,320
they really do feel bad toward us.

204
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,270
We're family, after all.

205
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,630
We are always connected.

206
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,270
Our roots are in Nanqiao.

207
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:04,230
When your dad and I get old,
we'll have to go back too.

208
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:12,350
And your sister is still there.

209
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,700
Looks like you're finally free.

210
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:55,270
No one is around

211
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,060
to keep watching you
like a prisoner anymore.

212
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,870
Don't you think

213
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:14,150
Nanqiao Village is
like a long piece of string?

214
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,660
No matter how far we go,

215
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,150
one gentle tug

216
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,900
and it pulls us right back
to where we started.

217
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,540
The harder we try to run,

218
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,510
the more ridiculous it feels.

219
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:31,700
I think

220
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,660
I kind of get it now.

221
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:11,300
(Qiao's Handmade Noodle House)

222
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,560
Add a bit of vinegar.

223
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,350
I'm adding it first.

224
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:16,990
Okay.

225
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,270
Come on, you should try it.

226
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,720
Gives it a little different flavor.

227
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,420
Yeah, exactly.

228
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,870
You should add some too.

229
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:23,510
I will.

230
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,390
Qingyu, your mom's been back home

231
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:26,750
for over two months now, right?

232
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:27,870
Why isn't she back yet?

233
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,990
My grandpa's condition keeps flaring up.

234
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:30,900
He needs someone there.

235
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,990
That's the thing with old folks.

236
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,270
Falling is the worst for them.

237
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,700
Did you guys hear?

238
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:38,990
Wang passed away last night.

239
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:42,900
Which Wang?

240
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,110
The one from our neighborhood.

241
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:47,750
Your good friend, Wang Mumu's dad.

242
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:51,540
So, we've got to live well while we can.

243
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,270
Health is the most important thing.

244
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,660
Clean sheets and covers

245
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:57,820
are in the cabinet in my room.

246
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,900
Remember to unplug
the mosquito repellent in the morning.

247
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,180
It's dangerous if you don't.

248
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:03,660
Also,

249
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,660
don't set the AC too low.

250
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:07,550
Keep it around 25 or 26 degrees.

251
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,180
Too low wastes electricity.

252
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:10,590
Got it, Mom.

253
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:11,590
I'm hanging up now.

254
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,550
Is the bed ready?

255
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,070
Sis.

256
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:23,460
I've noticed you've been
in a better mood lately.

257
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:26,700
You're super patient
with Mom, and really thoughtful too.

258
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,870
Are you actually the real Qiao Qingyu?

259
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:31,550
You tell me. Do I look fake?

260
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,830
It still tastes the same.

261
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,150
When Dad used to pick me up from school,

262
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,030
he always bought me a bottle.

263
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:55,940
Mom never let me drink it.

264
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,900
I finished it in secret
before going home.

265
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:03,110
It was a little secret
between me and Dad.

266
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:04,980
Mom never knew.

267
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:10,180
These past few days,

268
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,460
I've been so busy

269
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,870
running between the hospital,
funeral home,

270
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:16,700
and cemetery.

271
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,500
That's when I realized how many things

272
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,260
you have to take care of when one dies.

273
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,900
I went to the police station
and canceled my dad's registration.

274
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:27,980
Now on our household record,

275
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,420
it's just me and my mom.

276
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:39,070
Last night, while packing my bags,

277
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,350
I found something.

278
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:44,900
Turns out my dad kept
all the birthday cards

279
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,460
I made for him when I was little.

280
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:50,070
There were seven in total.

281
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:53,390
From when I was three
all the way to nine.

282
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,350
After that,

283
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,390
his business failed.

284
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,390
And our whole life took a turn
for the worse.

285
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:07,590
Looking at those cards made me think...

286
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:11,660
If only we could turn back time,

287
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:15,220
back to when we were little,
wouldn't that be nice?

288
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:23,350
Oh right.

289
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,900
I forgot to tell you.

290
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,870
I got accepted to Yanbei University.

291
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:29,390
Congrats.

292
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:44,110
I'm planning to take Mom to Beining.

293
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,420
There's still a bit left
from the loan we took

294
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,500
to pay for Dad's treatment.

295
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,980
My aunts say
we don't need to pay it back.

296
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:55,070
They want me to use it

297
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,440
to settle down in Beining with Mom.

298
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:58,980
Will you ever come back?

299
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:01,660
I don't know.

300
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,700
I don't have a home in Huanzhou anymore.

301
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,550
What if I miss you?

302
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,350
Just call me.

303
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:22,870
Or write me a letter.

304
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,310
After you graduate,

305
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,700
you can come visit me in Beining.

306
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,790
I won't forget you.

307
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,310
You can't forget me either.

308
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,740
I promise.

309
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:47,830
Qingyu.

310
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,590
To be honest,
I've always admired Ming Sheng.

311
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,940
When I told you not to accept him,

312
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:56,630
I was being selfish.

313
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:02,980
I know.

314
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:06,740
You knew?

315
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,460
I'm heading off now.

316
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,310
Thanks, everyone.

317
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:36,980
Bye.

318
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:39,660
Xiaohong.

319
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:40,660
I'm leaving now.

320
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,350
Okay, bye.

321
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,070
Bye.

322
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:44,590
Oh, right.

323
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:46,870
Wang.

324
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:50,110
That patient in bed six
still has no one to stay with them.

325
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,460
Go ask the caregiver station

326
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,550
when someone can come over.

327
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:53,110
Got it.

328
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,180
Sorry to trouble you.

329
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:55,110
Yanqiu.

330
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:58,070
Waiting for your dad?

331
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:58,740
Yeah.

332
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:01,790
Doesn't your language program
include housing?

333
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:03,500
Why do you keep coming here?

334
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:05,940
Well, it's just my dad at home.

335
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,030
He's all by himself.

336
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:10,110
I'm just looking out
for a senior living alone.

337
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,900
Did Yanqiu already leave?

338
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:12,870
I think she just left.

339
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:16,590
Head Nurse.

340
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:18,500
Trying to set Yanqiu up again?

341
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,260
That's right.

342
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:22,310
I even told her to wait for me.

343
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:23,420
Ms. Zhang.

344
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:24,830
Ming Sheng.

345
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:26,310
Did you see Yanqiu anywhere?

346
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,310
No, I didn't.

347
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,110
The second she hears about matchmaking,

348
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,550
she runs faster than a rabbit.

349
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:32,870
Ms. Zhang,

350
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:35,420
are all these guys for Yanqiu?

351
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,070
Of course.

352
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,220
Look at this one.

353
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,390
Graduated from a top university.
He's a civil servant.

354
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:41,830
Handsome and capable.

355
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:42,980
A civil servant?

356
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:43,550
Exactly.

357
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,500
And this one?

358
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:47,830
Not as educated,

359
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,390
but his family got resettlement money.

360
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,870
They were given multiple houses.

361
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:51,940
And he's good-looking too.

362
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:53,940
So, he's probably loaded.

363
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,390
There's this one too.

364
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:58,790
His parents are
both university professors.

365
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,460
In the future,

366
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,390
they will definitely
get along great as a family.

367
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:02,070
Right?

368
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:02,940
Indeed.

369
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:04,660
Here's another.

370
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,390
More?

371
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:09,310
Why am I telling all this to a kid?

372
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:10,870
I'm off to find Yanqiu.

373
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:11,590
Alright.

374
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,500
Bye, Ms. Zhang.

375
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,310
Bye-bye.

376
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,110
Is she gone?

377
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,390
That was close.

378
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,980
Our head nurse is terrifying.

379
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,700
Come on, let's go.

380
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,310
Ms. Yanqiu.

381
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:31,150
Are you not going to consider it?

382
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,030
Those guys were actually pretty decent.

383
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,600
I'd be tempted myself.

384
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,940
Say that again and I'll hit you.

385
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:39,460
But seriously though,

386
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,180
you keep turning down blind dates.

387
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,500
Is it because you already like someone?

388
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:45,870
Really?

389
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:48,590
Then, go for it.

390
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:50,550
Try to get out of singlehood soon.

391
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:53,390
When it comes to love,

392
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:55,550
it's not up to just one person.

393
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:57,660
You'll get it when you're older.

394
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:05,390
Dad.

395
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:05,940
Hmm?

396
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:07,940
What brings you here?

397
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:09,350
Did you eat?

398
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:10,420
Yeah.

399
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,350
I just saw Ms. Zhang outside.

400
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:22,180
She was introducing some guys to Yanqiu.

401
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:25,420
Honestly,

402
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:28,070
those guys seemed pretty impressive.

403
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,870
I bet Yanqiu was kind of into it.

404
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:36,900
Didn't know you were into gossip.

405
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:38,500
How am I gossiping?

406
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,700
I'm just worried, alright?

407
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:42,420
Yanqiu is so gentle and kind.

408
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,590
She wouldn't hurt a fly.

409
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:45,030
What if some guy out there

410
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:46,070
tricks her or something?

411
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,830
Are we even talking about
the same Fang Yanqiu?

412
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,830
Don't change the subject.

413
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:54,310
Answer me this.

414
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:57,110
If Yanqiu really fell for someone else,

415
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:58,310
what would you do?

416
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:04,030
If she truly found someone she liked,

417
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:07,500
I'd wish her well.

Do you regret sending Qiao Beiyu
back to Nanqiao Village?

We really let her down.

436
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,870
Finish it and get back to your homework.

He said it was an emergency.

Come on.

You don't really think
your secret thing with Ms. Yanqiu

453
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:33,030
was flawless, do you?

454
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:34,390
Like no one ever noticed?

455
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:37,150
We already broke up.

456
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:39,700
I know.

But I can tell you both still care.

458
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,900
Dad, you've already sacrificed so much

459
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:47,700
for your career and me.

460
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:50,110
It's time you were honest with yourself
and went after

461
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:51,420
what really makes you happy.

sacrifice yourself on our behalf.

I'm not calling you miss anymore.

478

Just to keep things proper.

Since you're here,

482

why don't you come in with me?

While sorting files at the association,

492
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:32,900
I found a digital camcorder
Qiao Beiyu left behind.

493
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,420
Technically, it's her private stuff,

494
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,900
and I should've kept it to myself.

But after thinking it through,

496
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,630
I decided to give it to you.

waiting outside the delivery room.

they found out I was a girl,

504

they didn't even take a look at me.

Now that I think about it,

507
00:30:56,870 --> 00:31:00,500
maybe that was the moment
it was all decided

508
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,420
that I would
only bring them disappointment.

(Qiao's Handmade Noodle House)
I had all of their love and attention.

00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:30,660
No, I don't want to.

556
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:31,980
You do it yourself.

557
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:33,500
Alright, I'll do it then.

558
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,310
Wow.

559
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,900
It's so pretty.

560
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:20,630
Jinrui.

561
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:23,700
Bei?

562
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:26,550
Why are you back?

563
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:28,910
We're on break from the art school,
so I came home.

564
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:31,300
What happened?

565
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,820
I was tidying up earlier

566
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:35,110
and accidentally cut myself.

567
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:36,700
Let me see.

568
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,180
Hey.

569
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:38,660
Let me have a look.

570
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,340
I'll help you put on some ointment.

571
00:34:56,950 --> 00:34:57,470
Does it hurt?

572
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,260
It doesn't.

573
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:18,550
I don't know when it started.

574
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:23,860
All I know is that Jinrui was
my only salvation

575
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:27,180
in Nanqiao Village.

576
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,950
He was the dearest person to me.

577
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:40,660
Jinrui.

578
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:43,110
Have you thought more

579
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:44,260
about grad school?

580
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:45,630
I'm still thinking.

581
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:47,660
You should take the exam.

582
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,950
There's still two years to go.

583
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,110
Plenty of time to figure out
what you want to study.

584
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,380
By the way, Bei.

585
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,220
After you graduate from art school,

586
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,820
you should join a cultural troupe.

587
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:00,780
You're pretty, Bei.
A troupe would suit you.

588
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:04,820
We're not actually related by blood.

589
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:06,660
So I thought...

590
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:10,380
I thought we could
love each other freely.

591
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:13,780
That we could stay together forever.

592
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,340
Mm, this flavor's still the best.

593
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:18,660
Eat up.

594
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:32,220
But dreams always end eventually.

595
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:43,030
Jinrui left me.

596
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:46,700
He never looked back.

597
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:48,950
But I don't blame him.

598
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:55,070
Because I know this is just my fate.

599
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:59,070
I'm not someone who gets to be loved.

600
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:04,360
Hey there, pretty. All alone?

601
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,700
Come on, let's grab some food.

602
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:06,470
No thanks.

603
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:09,780
A girl by herself this late?
You must be lonely, huh?

604
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,600
Who even are you? What do you want?

605
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,430
Let's get some food.

606
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:14,150
No. I said I don't need it.

607
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:16,340
Who the heck are you?

608
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:20,430
Got some nerve, huh?

609
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:21,740
Out here acting like a creep?

610
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:22,910
Scram.

611
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:28,110
You okay, girl?

612
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,510
I'm fine.

613
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:32,630
Thanks.

614
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:33,860
No need to thank me.

615
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:36,470
What's wrong? Lost something?

616
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:39,380
Yeah, I think I left my phone inside.

617
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:40,220
It's here?

618
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:40,820
Yeah.

619
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:42,150
Alright, no biggie then.

620
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,590
I'll clear the place out
and find it for you.

621
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:45,550
We'll definitely get it.

622
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,150
That punk hurt you, didn't he?

623
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,860
Still, I can't totally blame him.

624
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,550
You're honestly really pretty.

625
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,630
Don't be scared. Come on.

626
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:06,590
We'll find your phone.

627
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:07,110
Let's go. Don't worry.

628
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:08,380
People are like that.

629
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:12,030
The more you want something,
the less you get it.

630
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:16,260
And the more you can't get it,
the more you crave it.

631
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,070
I couldn't figure it out.

632
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:24,220
What are you doing?

633
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,700
I already made myself clear.

634
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,150
We're over. It's done.

635
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:30,780
It felt like I was stuck in a loop.

636
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:33,590
Like there was no way out.

637
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:36,380
Even after I got sick,

638
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:38,260
I couldn't figure it out.

639
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,430
When I was in the hospital

640
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,700
they said it was appendicitis.

641
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:49,180
How did it turn into
that cursed disease because of him?

642
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:57,110
I didn't tell a soul.

643
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:02,430
I was in the hospital,
dazed and alone.

644
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:05,180
And I kept thinking

645
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,740
maybe I should just die.

646
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,740
But then, the school found out.

647
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,660
They gave me so much encouragement.

648
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:16,070
It helped me get back on my feet.

649
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:20,110
And later on,

650
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,630
my parents found out too.

651
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:25,340
