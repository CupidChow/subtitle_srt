00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:39,940
Yeah.

17
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,860
His parents had already agreed

18
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:43,550
on a plan for his future.

19
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,430
He'll study in France

20
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,430
and become a brilliant doctor.

21
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:50,070

in school,

23
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,430
but that's because
he doesn't care about the exams.

24
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,190
He actually

25
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,860
paid special attention
to language studies.

00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,510
after we leave.

190
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,590
What do you want to do?

191
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,180
I feel like having a burger.

192
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,230
I want to go to the amusement park.

193
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,940
I also want to go to the beach
to see a lighthouse.

194
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:43,420
Is that all?

195
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,660
Oh, Qiao Qingyu.

196
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,870
Is that all you want?

197
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,880
Being from the city

198
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,420
doesn't give you the right to taunt me,
who's from a small town.

199
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,660
I wouldn't dare.

200
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,020
What about you? What do you want to do?

201
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:08,390
I

202
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,510
want to get an afro perm,

203
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,270
go to a bar to watch a match,

204
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:16,420
and attend a concert.

205
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,390
I want to sit in the first row.

206
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,300
Oh, I just

207
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,060
want to do things I wanted to do

208
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,750
but never got the chance to,

209
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,630
just like adults.

210
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:33,940
Qiao Qingyu.

211
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,180
Look at the moonlight tonight.

212
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:39,750
It's beautiful.

213
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,020
It's beautiful.

214
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:50,350
Go to sleep.

215
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,300
Qiao Qingyu.

216
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:11,820
The moon

217
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:14,390
is beautiful tonight.

218
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:29,230
Can we take Jiujiu with us?

219
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:30,940
Sure.

220
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,510
Let's go together, Jiujiu.

221
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:34,870
Wait a minute.

222
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:35,990
Leave in this.

223
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:37,470
Everyone knows what you wore

224
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,160
when you went out.

225
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,540
It will be safer if you wear this.

226
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,590
I'll go downstairs and hire a taxi.

227
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,700
Look around the house

228
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,900
to see if you miss anything.

229
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,060
Remember.

230
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,990
Come down after I call you.

231
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:53,470
Ming Sheng.

232
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,390
What's wrong?

233
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,540
Thank you.

234
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,540
I will remember your kindness to me.

235
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:04,750
Why are you so mushy?

236
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:06,060
Wait for me.

237
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:34,900
Sir, will you take me to Jiangzhou?

238
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,590
It's too far. No.

239
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,630
Sir, will you take me to Jiangzhou?

240
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:27,870
Sure, get in.

241
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:28,760
Okay, give me a moment.

242
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,840
I have someone else with me.

243
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,000
I need to get my luggage too.

244
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,300
Okay.

245
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,900
Last night,
our station's community news hotline

246
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,880
received a clue
from a concerned citizen.

247
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,870
They said Qiao Qingyu
appeared at a classmate's home

248
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:51,000
in Chaoyang New Village.

249
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,870
Early this morning,

250
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,590
we rushed to Chaoyang New Village.

251
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:54,540
Are you Qiao Qingyu?

252
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:55,700
Are you Qiao Qingyu?

253
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,750
Here.

254
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,750
Qingyu.

255
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,060
Qingyu, where have you been?

256
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,750
Where have you been, Qingyu?

257
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,390
Are you Qiao Qingyu?

258
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:03,870
Where have you been?

259
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,660
Let me go!

260
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:18,820
Where have you been?

261
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:19,920
We're all worried about you.

262
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,150
Your family has tried
everything to find you.

263
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,470
This kid is inconsiderate.

264
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:24,820
- Ridiculous.
- Yeah.

265
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:36,940
Where have you been?

266
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,240
You've made your mom so worried.

267
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,110
Ming Sheng.

268
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:49,990
What's wrong?

269
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,150
Thank you.

270
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:54,180
I will remember your kindness to me.

271
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:16,240
Your mom
has been crying at home for days.

272
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,150
She's worried you'll...

273
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:17,700
Qingyu!

274
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,510
How could you be so inconsiderate?

275
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:33,870
Where the hell have you been?

276
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,590
How dare you come back?

277
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:43,270
Speak!

278
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,470
How dare you come back?

279
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,590
You're going to be the death of me!

280
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:03,510
Let's talk at home.

281
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,180
Qiao.

282
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:05,870
Keep an eye on her this time.

283
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:06,120
Okay.

284
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,720
Mr. Qiao,
you finally found your daughter.

285
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,500
Thank you.

286
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,350
Say something.

287
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,550
This scene is tear-jerking.

288
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:14,180
On behalf of the Qiao family,

289
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,790
I would like to thank
all warm-hearted people

290
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:17,830
who helped.

291
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,150
The Qiao family is finally reunited.

292
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,790
Grandpa, drink some tea.

293
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,310
No.

294
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:31,980
Kneel!

295
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,260
No.

296
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:35,390
Grandpa.

297
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,350
Are you aware of what you did wrong?

298
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:51,870
Speak!

299
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:53,660
I'm not wrong.

300
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:58,940
We just want you to apologize
and admit your mistake.

301
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,220
It'll be over if you admit your mistake.

302
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,980
You ruined

303
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,630
Jinrui's wedding.

304
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:06,980
Now they're getting divorced.

305
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,740
Grandma was so angry that she fell ill.

306
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:10,220
Admit your mistake!

307
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,590
Jinrui took care of this family,

308
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,830
but you ruined everything!

309
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,240
I can also take care of this family.

310
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,080
You think you're all grown up now,
don't you?

311
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,000
Why cause trouble?

312
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,110
Dad is talking.

313
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:23,550
You spoiled this child.

314
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:30,550
Grandpa.

315
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:32,070
Don't say so much.

316
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,350
Don't get yourself too worked up.

317
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:35,700
We didn't discipline her well.

318
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,420
We'll definitely discipline her
from now on.

319
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:41,070
Alright. She's home now.

320
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,150
Let's go home.

321
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:44,790
Come on. Go home. Come on.

322
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,700
Come on, Grandpa.

323
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,870
Let's go.

324
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:49,900
You.

325
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,790
Hurry and take her back our hometown.

326
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,070
With everything that has happened,

327
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,550
we have to give an explanation.

328
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,260
Let Qingyu get up.

329
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,030
We'll go now.

330
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,180
Go.

331
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:11,180
Look at how much trouble you've caused!

332
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,460
Dr. Ming, we'll go out first.

333
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,070
Okay.

334
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:47,700
Someone called the TV station

335
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,870
and revealed Qiao Qingyu's whereabouts.

336
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,740
It could only be you.

337
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:54,460
The caller

338
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,500
just wanted to prevent a mistake.

339
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:59,220
Why are you so insensitive
to other people's feelings?

340
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:01,980
You always interfere in my life
as if it's your right.

341
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,740
I don't have time to explain to you.
I'm busy.

342
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,150
Does being a parent

343
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,460
make everything you do
automatically right?

344
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,220
Sheng.

345
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:10,980
There are no parents

346
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,260
who don't love their children.

347
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,310
Excuses!

348
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,070
I'm telling you.

349
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:19,630
I hate your control.

350
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,460
I don't want anything to do with you.

351
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:23,940
When will you

352
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:26,030
completely disappear from my life?

353
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,830
The day you really grow up.

354
00:20:52,825 --> 00:20:55,087
(In Operation, Operating Room)

355
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:23,590
(Qiao Qingyu.)

356
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:25,740
(Don't leave.)

357
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,420
(Wait for me to come back.)

358
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:29,790
(Pinky promise.)

359
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,260
(No changes for 100 years.)

360
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:07,310
Why can't she just apologize

361
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,790
for something so serious?

362
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,220
The older one is dramatic,

363
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,900
and the younger one is stubborn.

364
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,900
I don't know how you raise her.

365
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,390
It's all my fault.

366
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:20,660
It's all my fault, okay?

367
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,460
They got their good genes from you.

368
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,740
I gave them all the bad genes.

369
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:25,110
I gave birth to three children.

370
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:26,830
I worked hard to raise them.

371
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,550
I didn't raise them well.

372
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:29,980
I spoiled them.

373
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,360
That's why your family

374
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,440
should point your finger at me
and scold me, right?

375
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,460
Can't I say anything?

376
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,420
You did raise the kids, right?

377
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,350
What's wrong with me
asking her to apologize?

378
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,030
Yes, I can understand making mistakes
during the rebellious period.

379
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,790
But she's only 18 years old.

380
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:44,310
If you can't control her now,

381
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:46,260
can you control her when she grows up?

382
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,220
Tell me how to settle this.

383
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,980
Dad, I'm hungry.

384
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:55,590
Is it my decision?

385
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,310
Your family calls the shots.

386
00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:58,980
Dad.

387
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,630
Help me cook a bowl of noodles.

388
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,660
I want tomato noodles.

389
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,350
You lost weight.

390
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:50,260
Your dad and I had no choice.

391
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:52,500
Your grandfather is furious.

392
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:55,390
We had to pretend.

393
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,740
You're really bold.

394
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,150
How can you just leave

395
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:05,350
without telling us?

396
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:07,070
The whole family was looking for you.

397
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,790
We even went to the police station
to report it.

398
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:11,390
Where have you been these days?

399
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,590
My classmate's house.

400
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:17,390
Which classmate?

401
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:18,980
The classmate sitting across from me.

402
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:24,120
The male classmate, Ming Sheng?

403
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,110
The jacket and the shoes from last time
are all his.

404
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:26,830
Right?

405
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:29,660
He and I are just ordinary classmates.

406
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:31,590
He found me and saw that I had a fever,

407
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:33,590
so he let me stay in his house
for a few days.

408
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:34,550
He helped me.

409
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,030
He took the initiative to find you

410
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,180
and let you stay at his house
for a few days?

411
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:39,830
Is that so?

412
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:42,030
Why would he find you?

413
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,420
If you didn't contact him,

414
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,660
how did he find you?

415
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:46,110
There are only two possibilities.

416
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:50,280
One, he has ulterior motives.

417
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,310
He wants to be with you.

418
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:52,870
There's another possibility.

419
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:54,030
You threw yourself at him.

420
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:55,260
Which one is it?

421
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,500
Neither.

422
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:00,150
He just felt sorry for me
and wanted to help me.

423
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:01,400
You're defending him?

424
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,660
Do you care that much about him?

425
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,630
No.

426
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:05,120
No?

427
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,550
What are you worried about then?

428
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,700
What are you afraid of?

429
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,940
I'm not afraid.

430
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:11,900
Oh.

431
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,500
You're afraid that I'll find him.

432
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,240
You're afraid
that I'll embarrass you, right?

433
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:17,870
You can scold me if you want.

434
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:20,110
He helped me out of kindness.
Why look for him?

435
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:21,550
So you threw yourself

436
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:23,900
at him!

437
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,700
What have you two done together

438
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,630
these days?

439
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,150
Nothing.

440
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:33,720
Qiao Qingyu.

441
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,790
You think you can fool me
with something like this?

442
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,630
Qiao Qingyu.

443
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:39,660
You're only 18 years old.

444
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,740
I told you many times.

445
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:45,030
What were you thinking?
Can you keep it in mind?

446
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,700
If others found out about this,

447
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,440
how will they think of you?
How will you live?

448
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,680
Have you ever thought about it?

449
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,390
Why are you the same as your sister?

450
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:53,870
I can't watch you

451
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:55,030
end up like your sister.

452
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:58,460
Why can't you just do as I say?

453
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:00,030
You're young.

454
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,630
You're ignorant. You don't know.

455
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:03,070
Can't you just do what we say?

456
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:04,310
Do you think we'd kill you?

457
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,660
You killed Qiao Beiyu.

458
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:09,420
Didn't you send her back
to Nanqiao Village?

459
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,900
Didn't you give her

460
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,180
to Qiao Jinrui?

461
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:14,030
You blame us for everything,

462
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:16,200
while you always suffer the most
and are the most sober.

463
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,900
Can you reflect on yourselves?

464
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,700
You always take the moral high ground

465
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,700
to manipulate us.

466
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:21,630
You force me.

467
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,070
If you force me too much one day,

468
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:24,740
you'll ruin me, believe it or not?

469
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:28,700
I dare not ruin you.

470
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,350
While you're still alright, leave.

471
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:35,180
Hurry and leave. Leave me.

472
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,390
Stay away from me.

473
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:37,790
Stay away from this family.

474
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,630
I don't care if you die outside!

475
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:40,940
Go!

476
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:42,790
I'll go.

477
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:49,630
Where are you going?

478
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,110
Come back.

479
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,420
Mom, don't hit Qingyu.

480
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:01,940
I worked so hard to raise you.

481
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:02,830
Mom, don't hit Qingyu.

482
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,150
Mom!

483
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:06,070
Leave. You want to leave.

484
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:08,790
Who gave you the right to leave?

485
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,500
What are you doing?

486
00:27:57,787 --> 00:28:02,550
(Huanzhou People's Hospital)

487
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:03,912
(In Operation, Operating Room)

488
00:28:03,912 --> 00:28:05,662
(Operating Room)

489
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:09,460
Doctor.

490
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:10,940
Doctor, how did it go?

491
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:12,830
You must be
Tan Qianqian's family members.

492
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:13,660
Yes.

493
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:15,900
The patient had a sudden hemorrhage
during the operation.

494
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,110
We couldn't save her.

495
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:18,870
We're very sorry.

496
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:19,870
Sorry.

497
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:26,700
How could this happen?

498
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:29,070
What should we do?

499
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:26,500
I'll disinfect the edges of your wound
with alcohol first.

500
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:27,550
Bear with it.

501
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:32,870
Bear with it.

502
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,550
Don't dodge.

503
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,460
All done.

504
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:42,980
Well, you look a bit ugly,

505
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:44,940
but they're just superficial wounds.

506
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,180
You'll be fine in two days.

507
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:50,900
Qingyu.

508
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:53,550
It was wrong for Mom to hit you,

509
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:56,550
but Mom was mad.

510
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:58,560
Just listen to me
and stop being stubborn.

511
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,440
Isn't it just saying sorry
to admit your mistake?

512
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,400
It's not that difficult.

513
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,330
I didn't do anything wrong,
why should I admit it?

514
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:07,740
Dad, Mom, Grandpa,
Uncle Haisheng, and Uncle Jiangsheng.

515
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,150
Everyone says you're wrong.

516
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:11,150
Am I wrong because they say so?

517
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:15,150
What else?

518
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:17,420
When we were little,

519
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,550
they taught us to be honest,

520
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:21,310
not to bully others, and not to lie.

521
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,110
But when Qiao Beiyu was bullied,

522
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:24,110
they lied about it.

523
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:25,700
I revealed the truth,

524
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,070
and they said I was wrong.

525
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,310
So what's right, and what's wrong?

526
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:35,110
I don't know if it's right or wrong.

527
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,460
But at the end of the day,

528
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,350
Mom and Dad will never hurt you.

529
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:41,420
I haven't told you yet.

530
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:43,590
Mom was almost hit by a car

531
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:45,790
while trying to find you.

532
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,900
If she didn't truly care about you,

533
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:51,180
why risk her life to find you?

534
00:31:00,687 --> 00:31:03,987
(Painkillers)

535
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,390
Take the pills.

536
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,260
It won't cure me.

537
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,790
Get treatment if you're sick.

538
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,110
Take it.

539
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,220
I'm the one who's sick.

540
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,590
I'm the one who's sick, okay?

541
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:57,350
(Are you okay?)

542
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,660
(Do you need me to do anything for you?)

543
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:11,740
A door with an iron grill.

544
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:14,430
Mom doubled the security.

545
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:15,910
From now on,

546
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:18,630
you're living like Jiujiu.

547
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:44,340
I am Qiao Qingyu's mom.

548
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,180
Stay away from my daughter.

549
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:49,260
If you continue to bother her,

550
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:50,780
I can do anything,

551
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:52,110
including murder and arson.

552
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,510
I returned the jacket
to the boy sitting across from you.

553
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,150
I also warned him.

554
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,660
If he bothers you again,

555
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:31,220
I will burn down his house.

556
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,990
Give me your transportation card later.

557
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,340
Starting this semester,

558
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:49,340
I'll personally
pick you up and drop you off,

559
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,180
whether you're going to school
or coming home from school.

560
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:54,480
You don't need to carry any money.

561
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,630
Tell me what you need to buy

562
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:56,990
and I'll buy it for you.

563
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:59,030
I'll top up your meal card every month.

564
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,220
Don't worry about anything else.

565
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:03,070
Just focus on your studies.

566
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:06,430
And think it through.

567
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:07,920
Don't tell anyone

568
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,550
what happened between you and that boy.

569
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:11,180
Including your best friend.

570
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:12,910
Do you understand?

571
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,470
If he bothers you again,

572
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,110
tell me immediately.

573
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,070
No matter what happens,

574
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:24,180
don't hide it from me.

575
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:27,860
I don't care if you're willing.

576
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,740
I'm going to look out for you.

577
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,780
Your dad and I don't ask for much.

578
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,070
We just want you to be safe

579
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:34,550
and get into college smoothly.

580
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,470
I won't care about you anymore
after you go to college.

581
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:39,630
I won't care at all.

582
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:48,550
I'm going to feed the bird.

583
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,700
Didn't I just say
that you can't be distracted?

584
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,220
Why care about a bird when you
can't even take care of yourself?

585
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:55,700
Set it free later.

586
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,340
It's injured.

587
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,030
If I set it free now, it will die.

588
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,820
I'll set it free when it recovers.

589
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,700
It won't affect my studies.

590
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,590
Hey, what happened to her face?

591
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,380
Is she the one on TV?

592
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:50,660
She's famous now.

593
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:52,430
She's a celebrity.

594
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:55,470
Don't even mention it.
My mom followed her news every day.

595
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,680
She's more invested than I am
when following idol dramas.

596
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,510
When she hugged her mom at the end,

597
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:01,220
my mom cried so hard.

598
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,740
Do you know why she ran away from home?

599
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,550
Don't you watch TV?

600
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,480
I asked because I don't watch TV.

601
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,960
You can't judge a book by its cover.

602
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,780
I didn't expect
Qiao Qingyu to be so bold.

603
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:11,860
Yeah.

604
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:13,660
You could never tell.

605
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:17,260
It's been hard for you.

606
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,510
This is a self-study session.

607
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:21,780
Stop gossiping.

608
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:35,590
Stop chatting.

609
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:37,220
Focus on studying.

610
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:42,340
Mr. Sun.

611
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,740
I still don't get it
even after going through the solution.

612
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,910
Please explain it to me again.

613
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:49,800
This question is mainly

614
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,470
about finding
the weight of barium sulfate.

615
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:52,380
You know this, right?

616
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:54,120
The key to solving this question

617
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,040
is that barium ions
react with hydrogen sulfate ions

618
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,630
to form a precipitate of barium sulfate.

619
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:58,660
This white precipitate

620
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,820
is insoluble.
It doesn't dissolve easily.

621
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:02,550
We can weigh it

622
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:03,950
by filtering and drying it.

623
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:05,150
Got it.

624
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:08,910
Qingyu, come outside with me.

625
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:13,220
Qingyu.

626
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:15,430
I saw the community news

627
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:16,470
a while ago.

628
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:19,150
I don't know the details,

629
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:20,660
but I believe you have your reasons.

630
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:23,220
When I was your age,

631
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:24,430
I was also rebellious.

632
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,150
I spent my entire adolescence

633
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:27,990
arguing with my parents.

634
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:30,740
What happened afterward?

635
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:32,260
Afterward,

636
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:35,300
I became like every other kid.

637
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:36,950
I grew up.

638
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,300
They got older too.

639
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:41,950
I said these

640
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:42,920
to tell you

641
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,300
that it's normal to have your own ideas
during adolescence,

642
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,550
but you have to know the limit.

643
00:39:47,237 --> 00:39:48,560
If you still believe me

644
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,820
and think there's anything

645
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:50,990
I can help you with,

646
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:52,180
just tell me.

647
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:53,380
Don't think of me as a teacher.

648
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:54,560
Just think of me as a friend.

649
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:55,910
Actually,

650
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:58,300
I know about your situation in school.

651
00:39:58,550 --> 00:39:59,590
The school has established

652
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:02,120
an effective mechanism to prevent
and control bullying in school.

653
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:02,940
(They also announced)

654
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:05,980
(the phone number of the vice principal
in charge of safety and legal matters.)

655
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:06,980
(If you have any issues,)

656
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:09,030
(seek help from the school.)

657
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,360
(If necessary,)

658
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:13,080
(the school also has teachers
who provide psychological counseling)

659
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:13,820
(to help you.)

660
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:15,990
(Don't keep it to yourself)

661
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:17,150
(and face it alone.)
