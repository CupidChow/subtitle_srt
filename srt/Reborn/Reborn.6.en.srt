(Adapted from the serialized work "Reborn"
by Qiang Yu)

15
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,610
There's a basketball contest

16
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:38,200
after school today.

17
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,360
As the host of the contest,

18
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,410
we have to cheer for

19
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:42,610
our schoolmates.

20
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:43,890
Okay.

21
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,410
Qingyu, will you watch
the basketball match?

22
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:48,410
Nope.

23
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,720
Qiao Qingyu doesn't think of herself

24
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,050
as a member of Class 5 at all.

25
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:54,970
Yeah.

26
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,280
Let's go. The match will start soon.

27
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:58,530
Let's go.

28
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,650
Hi, welcome.

29
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:31,930
Thanks.

30
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,280
Just a moment.

31
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,880
Please get me the menu.

32
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:38,930
Here's the menu.

33
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:40,370
Feel free to make an order.

34
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:46,370
I'll just have a glass of water.

35
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,320
Our lemon tea and coffee are both

36
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,130
really popular.

37
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:51,280
And we also have an afternoon tea set.

38
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,370
Won't you take another look?

39
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,760
Just get her a lemon tea.

40
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,280
Alright.

41
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,000
You really look a lot like your sister.

42
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:04,040
But for some reason,
just by looking at you,

43
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,720
I can tell you two
are totally different.

44
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,280
Are you close with Qiao Beiyu?

45
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,560
You asked me out today

46
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,000
just to talk about Beiyu, didn't you?

=Episode 6=
(The Rumors about Beiyu)

48
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,320
(Nanqiao Village isn't big.)

49
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,760
Kids there just grow up wild and free.

50
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,210
(We all ran barefoot in the mud.)

51
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,210
(When I was little,)

52
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,930
(I thought every kid
grew up the same way.)

53
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,600
(Then, I met Beiyu.)

54
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,600
(Before that,)

55
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,440
(I'd never seen a girl that pretty.)

56
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,130
(Feihai.)

57
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,410
- Jinrui.
- Jinrui.

58
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,690
This is my sister, Beiyu.

59
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:51,320
Let's all hang out together.

60
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,930
Hi, everyone.

61
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,000
This is for you.

62
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,410
Thanks.

63
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,000
(The days just went by.)

64
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,170
Beiyu only grew
more and more beautiful.

65
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,850
I don't know when it started,

66
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,370
but our classmates began bullying her.

67
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,320
(They said she had no parents,)

68
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:37,810
(and no manners.)

69
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,690
(Those rumors spread like a plague.)

70
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:43,640
(They went everywhere.)

71
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:47,930
People always underestimate
how damaging gossip is.

72
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,930
Especially in a small place like that.

73
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,200
If someone wants to ruin you,

74
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:53,960
it doesn't take much.

75
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:59,760
(The school found out
and arranged counseling for her.)

76
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,490
I've lost count of how many times

77
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,080
I wished I could go back in time

78
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:06,810
and make a different choice.

79
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:10,730
(But back then,)

80
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,050
(I was timid and weak.)

81
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,930
(I just stood there
and watched Beiyu get bullied,)

82
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,000
(but didn't even have
the guts to help her.)

83
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:21,170
What are you staring at?

84
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:21,930
You zoned out.

85
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,050
What's wrong?

86
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:25,000
Lost your mind? That's pathetic.

87
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,760
Cut it out.

88
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:30,080
You're no fun.

89
00:05:32,162 --> 00:05:33,440
(Jinwei Mingshidi, Mingshidi KTV)

90
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,290
(After high school,)

91
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,440
(Beiyu moved to Huanzhou)

92
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,930
(to attend the art vocational school.)

93
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,050
(I got into a university in Huanzhou.)

94
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:42,320
(We finally left Nanqiao Village.)

95
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,880
I went looking for Beiyu once.

96
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:49,320
- (But at some point.)
- I think I'll skip it tomorrow.

97
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,490
(She had changed.)

98
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,640
(She started acting
just like the rumors described.)

99
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,610
You're hurting me.

100
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:00,520
I said stop it.

101
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,680
Don't touch me again.

102
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,960
What do you think you're doing?

103
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,370
You...

104
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,290
Getting bold now, huh?

105
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:09,930
Aren't you?

106
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:12,880
Hello, boss.

107
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:16,320
Don't scare anyone.
Keep your voice down.

108
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:25,000
Later on,

109
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:27,960
I went abroad as an exchange student.

110
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,960
And the next thing I heard about Beiyu

111
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,690
was that something had happened.

112
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:36,690
Did my parents know

113
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:38,170
that Qiao Beiyu was being bullied?

114
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,690
Once, Beiyu ran away from home.

115
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:44,520
She went to Shunyun.

116
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:46,560
It was your parents

117
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,130
who sent her back to Nanqiao Village.

118
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,960
So they knew everything?

119
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,400
But instead of helping Beiyu,

120
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,080
they threw her right back into the fire.

121
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,490
I believe
they must have had their reasons.

122
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,930
After all, parents always want
what's best for their children.

123
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,080
So you're saying

124
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,640
you also had your reasons
for not helping Beiyu?

125
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,400
That's not it.

126
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,850
I never tried
to make excuses for myself.

127
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:16,640
Whenever I think of Beiyu,

128
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,130
I still feel guilty.

129
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,080
So what?

130
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,610
Qiao Beiyu is dead.

131
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,050
She is never coming back.

132
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,250
You're telling me all this

133
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,560
just so you can

134
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,640
feel a little better.

135
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,240
You're fake and spineless.

136
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,720
You're no different from the people

137
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,640
who bullied Qiao Beiyu.

138
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,880
You were part of it too.

139
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,290
Qingyu.

140
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:35,400
Qingyu!

141
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:38,400
Qingyu!

142
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:39,880
Qingyu!

143
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,690
Hold on, Qingyu!

144
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:42,810
Qingyu!

145
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:43,250
Hold on.

146
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,200
What more do you want?

147
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:48,320
This is a dance video from high school.

148
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:50,080
Beiyu performed it

149
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:50,930
at a talent showcase.

150
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,690
I heard this dance

151
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,850
got her on the shortlist
for the Starlight Cup.

152
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,440
It's a shame.

153
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,370
She never got to take part in it.

154
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,130
Isn't that Qiao Qingyu?

155
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,930
You're right.

156
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:07,250
I am fake and spineless.

157
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:08,880
So that's why

158
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,200
you're more qualified
than me to keep this.

159
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,810
She looked all quiet at school,

160
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,000
but this is something.

161
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,810
Are you guys eating or not?

162
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,610
Of course we are.

163
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:21,200
Then, hurry up.

164
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,200
Let's go.

165
00:08:29,414 --> 00:08:32,810
(Huanzhou Youth New Year's Showcase)

166
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:43,920
Qingyu.

167
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,520
Come and have some water.

168
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:47,160
I'm not thirsty.

169
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,000
Have your brother do the dishes.

170
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,640
Yu.

171
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:54,250
Help your sister clean up those bowls.

172
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:54,920
Coming.

173
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:04,400
Mom, that was unfair.

174
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,090
I have to deliver food,

175
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:07,850
wipe the tables,

176
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:08,920
and wash the dishes too.

177
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,250
That's way too much for one person.

178
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,090
Just because I don't do well in school

179
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,210
doesn't mean the dirty work

180
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:16,450
should fall on me alone.

181
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,250
Yu.

182
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:20,330
Yu?

183
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:21,450
What is it, Dad?

184
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:22,210
Here.

185
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,450
Deliver this.

186
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,880
I'll help you.

187
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,800
Dad, did you see that?

188
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,520
She offered to do it on her own.

189
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,450
I wasn't slacking off.

190
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,680
Then, why don't you go ahead

191
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,400
and do the dishes?

192
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,210
Go on.

193
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:38,400
Okay.

194
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:40,640
What's wrong?

195
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:18,160
Delivery.

196
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:20,520
One bowl of fried noodles, no spice.

197
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:24,130
Anyone there? It's Qiao's Noodle Shop.

198
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:32,840
It's eight yuan.

199
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,130
I haven't given you the change.

200
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,330
Keep the change.

201
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:09,160
Next up,

202
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,280
please fill in your class's
subject grades

203
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,760
into the spreadsheet.

204
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,640
Then, use the auto-average function

205
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,970
to calculate your class average.

206
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,800
And this class assignment today

207
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,210
will count for five percent
of your final grade.

208
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,520
Make sure you practice well.

209
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,330
Go ahead and get started.

210
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,640
Someone posted photos

211
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,280
of Ming Sheng
playing basketball in school.

212
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:32,970
He looks so hot.

213
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:34,160
Because of those photos,

214
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,130
kids from other schools
started leaving him messages.

215
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:37,880
So annoying.

216
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:39,880
Can't be helped.

217
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,920
Everything online is public anyway.

218
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,160
A quick search does it all.

219
00:13:47,977 --> 00:13:49,900
(Campus Network)

220
00:13:59,677 --> 00:14:04,810
(Search: Huanzhou Art School)

221
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,380
(Xu Mengmeng uploaded 79 photos
to "Art School Student Days")

222
00:14:19,382 --> 00:14:22,570
(Campus Network:
Xu Mengmeng's profile page)

223
00:14:24,988 --> 00:14:26,330
(Xu Mengmeng. Say hi to her)

224
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:29,000
(I'm Qiao Beiyu's sister.)

225
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,250
(Are you free today?)

226
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:38,160
Mr. Sun.

227
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,040
Mr. Li.

228
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,570
I'd like to speak before class ends.

229
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:42,000
Alright, go ahead.

230
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,520
Okay, I'll head out then.

231
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,210
Alright, students, listen up.

232
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,800
The next two self-study periods

233
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,330
will be switched to chemistry.

234
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,130
What? Seriously?

235
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:55,920
With how badly you
did on the monthly exam,

236
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,800
you should be ashamed.

237
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,768
(Xu Mengmeng:
I have some free time now.)

238
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,400
Miss, my stomach hurts a bit.

239
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,040
I'd like to go home early today.

240
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,370
Can you make it home on your own?

241
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:09,760
Yeah.

242
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,250
Alright, go on then.

243
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,760
Everyone packs up your things.

244
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,800
Back to the classroom.

245
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,520
Mr. Sun is such an honest man,

246
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,330
she was obviously lying.

247
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:27,520
Come on, let's go.

248
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:31,210
Let's go.

249
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:32,330
Mr. Liu.

250
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:33,920
Wait.

251
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:36,400
Didn't we agree at the last dinner

252
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,760
that it was all settled?

253
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,400
Why change your mind all of a sudden?

254
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,850
Why give the lead part to Zhang Yue?

255
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:46,730
I turned down two gigs just for this.

256
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:49,450
And I still have so many bills to pay.

257
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:51,570
Please help me out.

258
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:53,250
I don't need the lead role.

259
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,210
Just give me a small solo dance.

260
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:57,730
There's a 500 yuan difference
in a month.

261
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,640
Alright, Mr. Liu.

262
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,760
I'll call you later, okay?

263
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:03,730
Bye.

264
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,370
Qiao Qingyu.

265
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,730
Have a seat.

266
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,160
Thanks.

267
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,610
Go ahead, it's on me.

268
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:25,000
Thanks.

269
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:27,520
Your sister used to
talk about you a lot.

270
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,080
She even showed me your photo.

271
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,640
That's why I recognized you right away.

272
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:32,850
Qiao Beiyu talked about me?

273
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,570
Were you two good friends?

274
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:37,680
Sort of.

275
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,760
Beiyu seemed cheerful
and easy to get along with,

276
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,520
but I always felt

277
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,920
she kept a distance from everyone.

278
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,970
Like deep down,

279
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:46,400
she was guarding a huge secret

280
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,730
and didn't want anyone to know.

281
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:49,730
Did you know her boyfriend?

282
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,000
Boyfriend?

283
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:02,330
It's getting a bit chilly.

284
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,290
(Beiyu was beautiful.)

285
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,130
(Not long after she got to school,)

286
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:08,530
(she became the famous
campus belle of Huanzhou Art School.)

287
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:09,880
That boutique we mentioned

288
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:12,010
with the really cute clothes...

289
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,160
Let's go this weekend.

290
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,640
Let's go on the weekend.

291
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:17,530
Sure, sounds good.

292
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:18,920
Why are you still staring?

293
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:22,050
There was a line of guys who liked her
long enough to circle Huanzhou.

294
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:24,770
Qiao Beiyu.

295
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:26,920
Something came for you.

296
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,880
Thank you, Auntie.

297
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:35,050
Who is it this time? Another admirer?

298
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:36,880
I envy you.

299
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,760
I wish someone would
bring me food every day too.

300
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,440
That'd be nice.

301
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:42,480
If you like it, it's yours.

302
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:43,810
Here.

303
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,720
Then, I won't hold back!

304
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:52,640
Baby.

305
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,640
San, take this.

306
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:56,530
Baby.

307
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:58,570
You've been waiting long?

308
00:17:58,570 --> 00:17:59,440
Yeah.

309
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:01,240
Isn't that Beiyu?

310
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,720
It was a guy on a motorbike last week.

311
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,640
How is she with a guy
who drives a Mercedes?

312
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,770
No need to make a fuss.

313
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:09,010
She's pretty.
It's no surprise she's got admirers.

314
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:10,010
That's totally normal.

315
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:18,770
Too bad every guy she met
turned out to be trash.

316
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:27,610
Let's go get a hotpot after this, yeah?

317
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:29,850
I'll do your hair first.
Then, we'll go eat.

318
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,090
Get lost.

319
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,480
What are you doing?

320
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,850
I already made it clear.

321
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:39,370
We've broken up.

322
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,330
Oh, really?

323
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:43,810
Just because you said so?

324
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:44,880
Did I ever agree?

325
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:47,050
Tell me, did I agree?

326
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:48,240
Beat him up!

327
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,090
No!

328
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:50,810
Don't hit him! Don't hurt him!

329
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:52,240
I'll call the police!

330
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:53,400
Don't hit him!

331
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,240
Qiao Beiyu.
Try stepping in and I'll smack you.

332
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,610
Hei, calm down!

333
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,440
Hei.

334
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:02,880
It's not on me.

335
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,530
I didn't know she was your girl.

336
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,130
She was the one who came on to me.

337
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,440
Shut your mouth!

338
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,050
Shut it!

339
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:25,880
Alright then.

340
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,530
Come on.

341
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:28,640
Did you hear that?

342
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,010
Did you hear what he just said?

343
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:31,770
He said you came on to him.

344
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:34,160
I liked you so much.

345
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,010
I really did.

346
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:36,810
And you cheated on me?

347
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:38,770
How am I supposed to face anyone now?

348
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:39,570
Tell me.

349
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:41,160
Tell me!

350
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:42,850
Come on, say it.

351
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,440
Have no shame, huh?

352
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,090
Fine. I'll deal with you myself today.

353
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:49,960
Come here. Come on over.

354
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,610
See this?

355
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:51,770
She is Qiao Beiyu.

356
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:53,010
Stop touching me!

357
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:59,370
Your sister looked smart,

358
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:00,960
but she was easier to fool than anyone.

359
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,610
As long as a guy
treated her a little nicely,

360
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:05,050
she would pour her heart out

361
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:06,330
and love with all her life.

362
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,240
And the more she did that,

363
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:11,400
the more men
thought she was easy to use.

364
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,610
And the harder they hurt her.

365
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:18,130
You're finally back.

366
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:19,770
Mr. Tang asked about you today.

367
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:22,240
He said if you skip class again,
you won't pass this term.

368
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,010
Seriously.

369
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:25,920
I've never seen
anyone date like you do.

370
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:30,160
What happened?

371
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:32,920
Let me see.

372
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,320
Who did this?

373
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,770
Come on, we're going to the police.

374
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,920
We can't. Don't go.

375
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:42,130
You broke up with him, didn't you?

376
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,960
I don't know.

377
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:52,720
Why does everyone treat me like this?

378
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,960
I gave them everything I had.

379
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:57,810
Mengmeng, do you think
it's all my fault?

380
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:00,480
Maybe I'm just someone

381
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:04,370
who doesn't deserve to be treated well.

382
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:06,720
Qiao Beiyu, what are you saying?

383
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,010
Can you snap out of it?

384
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:09,770
I know I'm not okay right now,

385
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:13,400
but I just can't help it.

386
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:21,050
I really can't help it.

387
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:23,050
I've lost control of myself.

388
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:28,570
But it's like Beiyu was under a spell.

389
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:29,960
She never learned her lesson.

390
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:31,400
I've tried talking to her,

391
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,240
even yelling at her,

392
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,050
but it didn't work.

393
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:36,440
Were any of her boyfriends
from Nanqiao Village?

394
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:43,680
I think she did mention
someone from back home once.

395
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,610
What was his name?

396
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:47,570
She had so many admirers.

397
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:48,570
I really can't remember.

398
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,880
Look, I'll help you look into it.

399
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,370
If I find anything, I'll let you know.

400
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:02,200
You should head home.

401
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,530
Don't make your parents worry.

402
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,200
Waiter, check please.

403
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,050
Mengmeng.

404
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,570
If Qiao Beiyu were still alive,

405
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,330
would she have
become a dancer like you?

406
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:27,130
(Have you ever seen Beiyu dance?)

407
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:30,850
(Whenever the music played,)

408
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:33,770
(her movements flowed out so naturally.)

409
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:36,010
(She lit up the whole stage.)

410
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:40,160
(She had the best grades in our class.)

411
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:42,400
She would never end up like me,

412
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,240
just scraping by in a no-name troupe.

413
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,960
(Beiyu once said)

414
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:48,440
(that after graduation,)

415
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,770
(she wanted to keep studying.)

416
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,370
(Her dream was to join
a professional dance company,)

417
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,200
and become a top dancer.

418
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:21,330
Excuse me, did you order this delivery?

419
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:22,330
Nope.

420
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:25,770
Hi there, is this your order?

421
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:28,850
Over here.

422
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,130
What stunts are you pulling?

423
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:40,720
Nothing.

424
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,960
I just thought
we could help each other out.

425
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,720
Look, her family runs a noodle shop.

426
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,130
And we haven't had lunch.

427
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:48,440
Why not give them some business?

428
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,810
And it keeps those sketchy guys

429
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:52,770
from spending money
just to mess with her, right?

430
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:56,720
One fried noodle, no spice.

431
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,760
Two bowls of beef noodles.
That's twenty-six in total.

432
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:00,770
Hold on.

433
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:01,770
Watch the attitude.

434
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:03,770
Haven't you heard the customer is god?

435
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,160
Is that how you treat

436
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,050
all your customers?

437
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,000
I may not have money, but you do.

438
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,370
And you still try to skip paying?

439
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:11,610
Who said I wasn't paying?

440
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,770
Here's your money.

441
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:18,010
Take your noodles. I want a refund.

442
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:25,050
Forget it. Let it go.

443
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:26,130
Let it go, pal.

444
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,570
Let it go.

445
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,440
Twenty-six. Here's thirty.
Keep the change.

446

I lack of money,
but I don't take handouts.

447
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,370
Why does she always act like
she's better than everyone?

448
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,920

What is it with you?

452
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,610
Is it that hard to say thank you?

453
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:42,130
Thanks.

454
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:45,130
No problem.

455

456
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:49,200
and since we're heading the same way...

457
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:51,530

463
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:45,330
Was he your sister's boyfriend?

464
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,130
No.

465
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:49,920

getting hurt by her first love?

470
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,850
That's why any guy who's nice to her

471
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:20,850
makes her latch on
like her life depends on it.

472

473

489

Is it going to help you study?

00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,360
Oh right, don't tell that guy anything.

557
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,720
I don't want to hear him nag.

558
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,720
Like I'd say anything.

559
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,160
Thanks.

560
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,800
Get some proper rest.

561
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,610
Got it.

562
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,720
I am more than ten years older than you.

563
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,800
Calling me "Auntie"
wouldn't be too much.

564
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,410
Bed 37's surgery has been
moved to the afternoon.

565
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,530
How did the last surgery go?

566
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,450
The patient had a sudden hemorrhage
during the procedure.

567
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:25,480
Luckily, Director Li and I

568
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,760
found the bleeding spot in time.

569
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:28,800
It went alright, pretty smooth overall.

570
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,840
Where's Mingsheng? Has he gone back?

571
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:35,320
Yeah, he left.

572
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:38,800
I gave him everything
you asked me to pass on.

573
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:42,720
He told me not to
let you know he came by.

574
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:46,160
That little brat.

575
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:47,530
Honestly,

576
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:48,800
you and your son are the same.

577
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,760
You both say one thing and mean another.

578
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,720
You are both stubborn.

579
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,800
Like father, like son.

580
00:35:57,410 --> 00:35:59,050
Thanks for looking after Mingsheng

581
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:01,530
these past few days.
I really appreciate it.

582
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:04,320
Come on,

583
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,320
it was nothing.

584
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,970
I get to play the good guy.

585
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:12,320
Here.

586
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:18,720
By the way,

587
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,890
my parents are coming
to Huanzhou this weekend.

588
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:23,490
Would you like to grab a meal with us?

589
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:29,530
I get that you don't
want to go public with us.

590
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:31,160
I already explained it to them.

591
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,840
They will keep it between us.

592
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,610
It's just a casual dinner.

593
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:35,360
No big deal.

594
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:35,800
Alright.

595
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:46,200
Sure.

596
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,720
Let's have dinner.

597
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,720
Hurry up and eat. Take a nap after.

598
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,610
Qiao Qingyu.

599
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,530
Who are you?

600
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:22,570
We got on great when we chatted online.

601
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:24,200
You forgot me already?

602
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,320
You're Hei?

603
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,570
Yeah, that's me.

604
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:28,930
Come on, let's talk.

605
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,160
I need to head home first.

606
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,130
Hold on.

607
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,280
Weren't you the one

608
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,570
asking around about Hei?

609
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:36,610
What's with the act?

610
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,720
My mom is waiting for me at home.

611
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,610
You're going home this early?

612
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:42,930
Where's the fun in that?

613
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:45,160
Come on, let me treat you.

614
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,360
Let's get something nice to eat, yeah?

615
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,610
There's a bubble tea shop
across the street that's popular.

616
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:51,640
Let's go chat there.

617
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,970
Those guys don't look like good news.

618
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:56,680
Can she really mess with those guys?

619
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,680
Exactly. Let's go.

620
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,450
It's almost rush hour.
Buses will be packed.

621
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:10,360
You usually get your tea here?

622
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,720
This place looks pretty average.

623
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:15,280
Listen up,

624
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,160
today everything's

625
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,410
on Qiao Qingyu's big bro, Hei.

626
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:19,610
Order whatever you like.

627
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:20,680
Go on, it's on me.

628
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,530
Move it.

629
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:24,930
Order something. I'll pay.

630
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:26,800
You know Qiao Qingyu, right?

631
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:29,530
Come on. Sit.

632
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,450
Here you go.

633
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,320
Not bad.

634
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,320
I'm a huge fan of milk tea too.

635
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,240
Go on, drink.

636
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,130
We can order more.

637
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:56,360
I'll just call you Baby from now on.

638
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,760
That's what I used to call your sister.

639
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:02,680
How did you and Qiao Beiyu meet?

640
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,840
I saved her. Like a hero.

641
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:08,450
Outside a karaoke bar,

642
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:09,970
some guy was harassing her.

643
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:11,680
I stepped in and sorted it out.

644
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:14,130
She was still
at the art school back then.

645
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:15,720
She really loved singing.

646
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:18,000
She hung out at my karaoke place a lot.

647
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,130
I always looked out for her.

648
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,640
And over time,

649
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:24,450
we got together.

650
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:27,320
Honestly,

651
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,640
your sister was seriously pretty.

652
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,280
No way a girl like that
would fall for me.

653
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:33,890
It felt like I'd struck gold.

654
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:35,800
Of course I had to treat her right.

655
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:39,360
For real,
I slowly fell in love with her.

656
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,680
Whatever she said, I'd go with it.

657
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:44,450
But after a while,
it just didn't feel the same.

658
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,800
She wasn't anything special.

659
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,050
Your sister was just naive.

660
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:52,450
Any guy could sweet-talk her
and she'd fall for it.

661
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:54,890
Literally, any guy would do.

662
00:39:56,970 --> 00:39:58,410
Hey, come a bit closer.

663
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:01,010
I didn't mean to scare you.

664
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:02,410
I just get pissed off

665
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:04,800
whenever I think about her.

666
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,320
But I can tell

667
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,890
you're not like her.

668
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,160
You are

669
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:15,010
the innocent type.

670
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:16,240
Do you have a boyfriend?

671
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,010
So you met in Huanzhou?

672
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:19,450
Yeah.

673
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,610
Then, I got the wrong guy.

674
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:21,360
What do you mean?

675
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,610
Sit down, I'll explain.

676
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:24,610
No, I'm the right one.

677
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,410
We're meant to meet.

678
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:27,530
You were looking for me.

679
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:29,680
You know, I saw you years ago.

680
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,200
When did you ever see me?

681
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,010
You don't remember?

682
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,280
Outside the art school. Think about it.

683
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:52,320
Baby! Baby!

684
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,680
I've been waiting forever.
Come on, give me a hug.

685
00:40:56,970 --> 00:40:59,130
I bought you flowers. Do you like them?

686
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:01,930
Thanks.

687
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:03,570
Come on, don't act like a stranger.

688
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:05,360
You've been in class all day.

689
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:06,640
Aren't you tired?

690
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,450
I'm okay.

691
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,570
I'm kinda hungry. Let's grab dinner.

692
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:11,720
Come on.
I've already booked a seafood spot.

693
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,840
Let's go. I'll drive.

694
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:16,280
Qiao Beiyu!

695
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,530
I came to Huanzhou
for the Mathematical Olympiad.

696
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:24,280
Mom asked me to bring you some fruit.

697
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:25,840
Who are you?

698
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:28,050
I don't know you.

699
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,800
You're her sister from her hometown?

700
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,570
I just said I don't know her.

701
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:33,720
Go. Let's go.

702
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:34,680
I'm starving.

703
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,050
The kid really looks like you.

704
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:37,280
I told you, I don't know her.

705
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:42,760
Baby.

706
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:43,450
Qiao Beiyu!

707
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,890
I don't know you either!
Not now, not ever.

708
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,490
But you're the one
I care about most. I mean it.

709
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,130
Hurry up and drive.

710
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,160
Actually, I knew what your sister
was thinking back then.

711
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,720
She did it for you.

712
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:04,530
She cared about you.

713
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,570
Even though you were still young,

714
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:10,530
she didn't want you
to get mixed up with someone like me.

715
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:11,530
But it didn't work.

716
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:14,530
We know each other now,
and it's not too late.

717
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,890
Also, just look at you.

718
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,240
You've really grown into a beauty.

719
00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:22,970
Even prettier than before.

720
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:23,640
Don't touch me.

721
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,800
What if I do?

722
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,200
Stay away from me. Don't...

723
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,200
Don't touch me!

724
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,200
Hey, what are you doing?

725
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,200
From now on, you're mine.

726
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,800
Your sister owed me. You'll pay it back.
