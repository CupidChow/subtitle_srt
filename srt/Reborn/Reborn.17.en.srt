18
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:47,690
in December the year before that,

19
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:50,660
her condition was stable
in every aspect.

20
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:55,380
She went from stabilizing

21
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,460
to passing away in less than two months.

22
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:58,660

wasn't inevitable,

Qingyu, who told you to come?

43
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:45,930
I told you to wait it out
a little longer.

Go back.

It does.

110
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:27,130
But it was worth it.

111
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,370
My dad got me injured,

112
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,010
so my mom got into a huge fight

113
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:32,660
with him over that.

114
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:34,860
I think that actually
knocked some sense into him.

115
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,660
He promised to quit drinking.

116
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:41,810
For the first time in a long while,
we had breakfast together.

117
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:44,540
I guess that's one silver lining.

That's right. Qingyu,

123
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:57,780
you're a great dancer
and you know the routine well.

124
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,490
Why don't you take Mumu's place?

125
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:00,660
I can't do it.

126
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,900

141

146
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,930
Dawdle any longer
and Mom will talk your ear off.

00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,300
But that would be embarrassing.

188
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,540
Mumu, let's forget it.

189
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,570
We should quit now.

190
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,210
Yes. We should just not perform.

191
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,180
Am I too late?

192
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,050
I thought we were playing basketball.

193
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:30,180
Why are we watching a performance?

194
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:32,260
It's on the way to the court anyway.

195
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:33,640
Might as well take a break.

196
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,640
Got a problem with that?

197
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:35,810
No?

198
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,180
No.

199
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,200
Thank you

200
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,720
to the ladies of Victory Street
for the spectacular performance.

201
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,500
Disasters are merciless,
but we are kind.

202
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,330
Don't be nervous.

203
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:52,620
From this moment on,

204
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:54,810
you're no longer
the Qiao Qingyu trapped in a cage.

205
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:56,020
You're a bird in the sky.

206
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,300
Fly.

207
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,090
Our students are concerned
about world events

208
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:01,260
and the affected areas.

209
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:03,020
Next, let us all enjoy

210
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:05,090
the dance performance
by Huanzhou High School.

211
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:07,260
"The Song of Youth."
Please give them a warm welcome.

212
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:10,730
We're waiting.

213
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:11,780
Shut up, will you?

214
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:12,450
Okay, okay.

(when you turn back.)

232
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:04,440
Slow down, Mom.

233
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,680
What's the commotion over there?

234
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:12,210
- Great!
- Great!

235
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:18,620
Is that your sister?

236
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:20,900
No...

237
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,380
Qiao Qingyu!

238
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:28,540
Hey.

239
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,300
What's wrong?

240
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,780
My mom's here, Mumu. What do I do?

241
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,300
She's here? Shoot!

242
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:36,300
Did you see Qiao Qingyu?

243
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,660
What are you doing here, Mrs. Qiao?

244
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,090
Did you come to watch our performance?

245
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:39,680
Where's Qingyu?

246
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,180
Qingyu? Why would she be here?

247
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:42,810
Mumu.

248
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,540
Where is she?

249
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,810
What would she be doing here
of all places?

250
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:48,240
You must be seeing things, Mrs. Qiao.

251
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:55,090
I suppose I might be.

252
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:41,900
Qingyu.

253
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:46,970
You were on that stage today,
weren't you?

254
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:51,010
I knew it.

255
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,450
Don't worry.

256
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,770
I managed to convince Mom it wasn't you.

257
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,060
Thanks.

258
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:03,450
Qingyu,

259
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:08,210
you danced beautifully.

260
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:11,010
You were as good as Qiao Beiyu.

261
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,530
Qingyu!

262
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:48,660
Over here.

263
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:58,420
Sit.

264
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,730
Meixi saved a spot just for you.

265
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:02,210
I didn't. Don't be silly.

266
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,250
There are only three of us.

267
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,860
Let's eat lunch together from now on.

268
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:08,490
We can save a spot for you.

269
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,060
Thanks.

270
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:15,900
Let's put the past behind us.

271
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,490
Let bygones be bygones.

272
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,010
Got it.

273
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,250
Qingyu.

274
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,060
Let's check out

275
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,580
the co-op store after this.

276
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:30,900
That's the fatty part.

277
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:48,730
- "How are you?"
- Very good.

278
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:50,730
This is the real practice test

279
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,010
for the French knowledge quiz

280
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:53,010
and proficiency exam.

281
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,930
We still have some time left.

282
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:55,920
I'll leave it to you now.

283
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,100
Review the materials and see

284
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,970
if there are any points from this lesson
that you don't understand.

285
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:07,770
(Hao: Mr. Ming's case)

286
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:09,340
(seems to have escalated.)

287
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,930
(I think you should check on your dad.)

288
00:21:13,325 --> 00:21:17,200
(Huanzhou People's Hospital,
Suspension Notice for Investigation)

289
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:34,380
Make sure

290
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,800
Bed No.3 doesn't eat
12 hours before surgery.

291
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,180
And the patient in Bed No.27...

292
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:38,900
Ms. Yanqiu.

293
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:41,970
I need to talk to you.

294
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,060
Ms. Yanqiu.

295
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,060
Did my dad really do
what people are saying?

296
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:52,530
Did he risk someone's life
just for money?

297
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:01,530
The patient was in the late stage
of her sickness.

298
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:03,180
It was hilar cholangiocarcinoma.

299
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:05,580
The risk of surgery was too high.

300
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:06,620
She was already rejected

301
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,360
by several hospitals
before she came to us.

302
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:11,140
She and her husband knelt on the floor

303
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,380
and begged your father to save her life.

304
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,380
Your father accepted them
despite the objections.

305
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,250
The surgery went smoothly.

306
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:20,420
But there were complications afterward.

307
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,660
To save the patient's life,

308
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,250
your father performed a second surgery.

309
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:28,140
Sadly,

310
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:30,180
she didn't make it.

311
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:33,490
Then,

312
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:36,250
the patient's in-laws
didn't want to foot the medical bill,

313
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,380
so they blamed your father
for unnecessary health care.

314
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,010
The hospital suspended him
for further investigation.

315
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:48,690
Was it worth it for him

316
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:50,580
to do what he did?

317
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:54,620
That's something

318
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:55,970
only your father can answer.

319
00:22:57,930 --> 00:22:59,340
The Ming Qiuxin I know

320
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:03,340
always quietly and resolutely

321
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,900
does what he believes is right.

322
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:08,530
Even if he is misunderstood or wronged,

323
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:11,140
he won't find excuses or defend himself.

324
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,820
He's like that at work

325
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:15,140
and in life.

326
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,290

327
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,490
What are you doing here?

328
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:42,180
This is my home.

329
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,380
I can come home, can't I?

330
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:44,820
Of course.

331
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,620
I just came back to grab something.

332
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:47,880
I'll be out of here in a moment.

333
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:48,450
I see.

334
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:51,770
Your food is burning.

335
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:52,970
Right.

(Université Paul-Valéry-Montpellier,

339
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,380
I've had some free time

340
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:37,770
the past few days,

341
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:40,210
so I did some research.

342
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:42,140
Take a look.

343
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,180
Take them with you

344
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,490
if you find them useful.

345
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,730
Have you eaten yet?

346
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:55,970
Let's eat together.

347
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:58,290
I learned a few new recipes.

348
00:24:58,290 --> 00:24:59,060
Try them.

349
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:03,580
Sure.

350
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,380
All right. Wait there.

351

Business is slower today.

wants you to do your homework,

353
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,010
so she had me deliver dinner to you.

354
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:27,010
Eat it while it's warm.

355
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,380
What about you?

356
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:29,420
I've already eaten.

00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,820
Jinrui and Bei's scandal

361
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,140
reached his workplace.

362
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:49,010
He resigned and disappeared.

363
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:50,600
His parents are worried about him.

364
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,200
They're searching everywhere for him.

365
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:52,620
So what?

366
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:53,970
He deserved everything.

367
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:00,420
There's something your mother
wouldn't let me tell you,

368
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:02,820
but I think you deserve to know.

369
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:05,930
You wrecked Jinrui's marriage.

370
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,580
His parents had no intention

371
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:08,900
of letting you off easily.

372
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:11,120
They threatened to go
to your school and make a scene,

373
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,340
to get you expelled.

374
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,340
But Jinrui warned them

375
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:16,290
not to.

376
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:18,010
They only backed off after that.

377
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:20,900
Qing,

378
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:24,930
I know he made some mistakes,

379
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:28,140
but he isn't beyond redemption.

380
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:41,290
Eat your food.

381
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:04,860
Wang! Wang...

382
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,820
We're his family. Can we go with him?

383
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:11,820
Can we?

384
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:13,060
Wang...

385
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,290
Is Mumu not here?

386
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:47,490
She took the day off.

387
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:49,420
Family matters.

388
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:08,490
Mom.

389
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,860
What took you so long?

390
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,450
Was class extended again?

391
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:18,420
Here, eat something first.

392
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:21,060

393
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:22,450
Mumu's father is sick.

394
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:23,770
I want to go check on him.

(Huanzhou People's Hospital)

396
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:40,930
Shut up!

397
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:52,210
Mrs. Qiao. Qingyu. You're here.

398
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:54,530
Mumu.

399
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:57,380
We're here to visit your father.

400
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,690
You must be hungry.

401
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:01,970
Qingyu,

402
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:03,730
you two go and eat.

403
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,450
I'll stay.

404
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:16,140
Have some noodles.

405
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:40,660
My dad has terminal liver cancer.

406
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:42,900
The doctor says

407
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:45,340
he might have a few more years

408
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,730
if he goes through chemotherapy.

409
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:48,860
If he doesn't,

410
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,860
he'll only have a few days left.

411
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:55,660
When my dad would get drunk and violent,

412
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,860
I wished more than once in my heart

413
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,730
that he would just die.

414
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,140
But now that it's actually come to this,

415
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:06,450
I don't know how to face it.

416
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,010
These days,

417
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,770
he seems like a different person.

418
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:15,900
He said

419
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:18,250
he should've taken
better care of himself.

420
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:20,860
He's not afraid of pain.

421
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,140
He wants the chemotherapy.

422
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,180
But my mom said

423
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:30,730
the chemotherapy won't cure him,

424
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:33,530
and it's too expensive.

425
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:35,730
We're already so deep in debt
to begin with.

426
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:39,930
We can't afford
to take on any more debt...

427
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:44,340
Qingyu...

428
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:50,730
I'm going to lose my dad.

429
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,620
What do I do?

430
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:20,770
We visited Mumu's father at the hospital.

431
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,530
It's terminal liver cancer.

432
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,530
He can't even have surgery.

433
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:28,100
He won't be around for much longer.

434
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:31,620
What about chemotherapy?

435
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,380
Each session costs tens of thousands.

436
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:38,100
Ordinary people can't afford that.

437
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,770
If you get a disease like this,

438
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,490
you just have to accept your fate.

439
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:45,060
Spending money on it is just
tossing it into a bottomless pit.

440
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,180
Makes sense.

441
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,250
In the end,

442
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:50,840
the money's gone, the person's gone,

443
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,580
and the whole family ends up
drowning in debt.

444
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:54,140
How pitiful.

445
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:56,580
If I ever get that sick,

446
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:58,450
don't you dare get me treated.

447
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:02,970
You'd better not get sick.

448

00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:26,180
would go
to the lantern festival together.

560
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:30,020
You were always a smart girl.

561
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:33,330
You'd say you were tired after a while.

562
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,330
You'd reach out your little hands

563
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:36,940
and try to grab me.

564
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:38,460
You wanted me to carry you.

565
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:40,730
You wanted to ride on my shoulders.

566
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:46,370
We used

567
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:50,020
to be

568
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:52,060
such a happy family.

569
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:54,620
Remember?

570
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,060
Yeah.

571
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:01,850
I know.

572
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,620
I've made too many mistakes
over the years.

573
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:08,460
I've let you down.

574
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,620
I've let your mother down.

575
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:13,460
I deserve to get sick.

576
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,850
I had it coming.

577
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,460
But I'm dying.

578
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,100
I don't want to leave you two.

579
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:33,460
Mumu...

580
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:38,210
I want to see you go to college.

581
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,620
I want to be there for your first job.

582
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:44,810
I want to see you get married
and start a family...

583
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:57,850
But we can't afford the treatment.

584
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:02,210
I can't drag you and your mother
down any further.

585
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:04,330
I'm sorry for everything, Mumu.

586
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:06,940
I was wrong.

587
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:07,850
If...

588
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:09,690
If I could get another chance,

589
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:12,060
I promise I'd do right
by you and your mother.

590
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,210
Okay?

591
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:14,810
Mumu...

592
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:19,540
Mumu...

593
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:10,330
Here you go.

594
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:11,410
Thanks.

595
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:16,100
You knew that family?

596
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:20,660
They've been my neighbors
my entire life.

597
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,330
They live across my grandfather's place.

598
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:28,140
Was it the same with the patient
who begged my father

599
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:30,410
to treat her?

600
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:40,180
When a person's life reaches the end,

601
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,770
their fate is often in the hands

602
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:44,890
of their families and doctors.

603
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:48,730
Their hope or despair
hangs on the decisions

604
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:51,620
made by either of these parties.

605
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:54,620
By the way,

606
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,680
the mediation panel decided on a time.

607
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,640
The investigation
of your father's medical dispute

608
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,370
is next week.

609
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:00,370
Okay.

610
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:04,620
And the thing I asked you to look into?

611
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:06,980
After Tan Qianqian's passing,

612
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:08,440
her husband never showed up again.

613
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,690
He won't answer our phone calls.

614
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,060
Her great-aunt came and caused
some trouble a few times.

615
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,140
They refused to pay the medical bill

616
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,500
and demanded compensation.

617
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,580
Your father's medical dispute mediation

618
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:18,890
was their request.

619
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:20,890
Did you try searching

620
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:22,020
for Tan Qianqian's husband?

621
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:23,770
We did, but we found nothing.

622
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:25,890
There's something

623
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:28,060
that stood out.

624
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:31,290
Our department received a pack of cash.

625
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:33,690
It was designated as payment
for Tan Qianqian's bill.

626
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:35,580
But we have no idea who sent it.
