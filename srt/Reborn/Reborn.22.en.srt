(I want to be a doctor.)

17
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:07,580
Not because of my dad.

18
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,950
But because I found something

19
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,270
I want to do.

20
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:15,710
What about you?

21
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,230
I want to get

22
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,860
into Jiangzhou University's
finance program like my parents wanted.

23
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,620
And once I'm in college,

24
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,300
I want to take on a part-time job

25
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,300
to help take
some of the load off my parents.

26
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,670

27
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,510
I want to help cure her illness

28
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:38,830
and give her a break.

29
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,880
I also want to take my whole family

30
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,830
and move out of that house
in Chaoyang New Village

31
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,860
to somewhere bigger, newer,

32
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,150
a place that belongs to me,

33
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,580

38
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,060
And I'll make them come true.

39
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,460

40
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,130

43
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,300
go through yet?

44
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,830
He's been chasing me about it.

45
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,550
Can't you see I'm already stressed out?

46
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,780

47
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,110
I don't have time to deal
with his stuff right now.

Who are you calling that?

51
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,860
Sun said to take

52
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,390
our old exercise books home to review.

53
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:01,900
Sheng doesn't need his.

54
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,060
He's already getting ready to take

55
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,830
the French proficiency exam in Beining.

56
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,990
He's not coming back to school.

57
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,180
Guess we'll meet again someday.

58
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,830
Sheng just left

59
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:15,460
without even a farewell meal.

60
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,710
That's cold.

61
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:17,540
Totally.

62
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,080
You could buy a ticket

63
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,830
and catch a glimpse of him
before he boards.

64
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:23,190
He barely touched his exercise book.

65
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,190
I'll use it as scratch paper.

66
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,950
I don't remember
you being that studious.

67
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,100
Deng Meixi.

68
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:30,980
Idiot.

69
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,070
I heard something happened to Hei.

70
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,310
He got beaten up
and landed in the hospital.

71
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,150
Luck is finally on our side.

72
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,400
Justice is served!

73
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,460
Good timing, too.
Your NCEE is just around the corner.

74
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,840
Now we can breathe a little easier.

75
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:10,270
We'll move after your exams.

76
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,780
Mom, Dad went to the noodle shop.

77
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,510
He made dinner for us.

78
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,660
Let's heat it up and eat.

Mom? Mom?

80
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:53,870
Did you take all of them?

81
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,020
Have some water.

82
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,340
I took three pills

83
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,510
and still couldn't sleep.

84
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:15,870
Lie down for a bit.

85
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,710
Does it hurt anywhere?

86
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,540
It's all my fault...

87
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,460
No, Mom.

88
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,540
These past few days,

89
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,190
I've been thinking a lot

90
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,340
about why you used
to be so strict with me.

91
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,750
There were a lot of things
I didn't do well.

92
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,460
And a lot

93
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,780
I didn't tell you.

94
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:22,980
Remember

95
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,190
the time I went to Jiangzhou?

96
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,780
I didn't go for a recruitment talk.

97
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,870
I went for a dance competition.

98
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,830
I know you don't like me dancing,

99
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,750
but when I dance,

100
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,340
I feel like myself.

101
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:51,310
And...

102
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,870
I wanted to finish what Beiyu couldn't.

103
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:02,830
Mom,

104
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:07,870
are you disappointed in me?

105
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,900
It's all my fault...

106
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,190
I'm growing up.

107
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:26,270
I have a lot of thoughts.

108
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,750
I keep a lot of things bottled inside.

109
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,990
But now I know

110
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,510
you're the one

111
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:42,940
who loves me most in this world.
The one I'm closest to.

112
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,590
From now on, I'll tell you everything.

113
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,590
Okay?

114
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,420
Mm...

115
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,820
When I first transferred
to Huanzhou High School,

116
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,300
I was miserable

117
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,270
because of what happened to Beiyu.

118
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,020
But I never told any of you.

119
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,390
The only person who helped me

120
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,420
was Ming Sheng.

121
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,780
Too young...

122
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,540
Huh?

123
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,590
You're still too young...

124
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,350
I know, Mom.

125
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:41,390
I've made things clear with him.

126
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,590
Besides, he's leaving the country soon.

127
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,510
There's no future for us.

128
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:59,750
Mom, there are only a few days left
until the NCEE.

129
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:01,900
But you know what?

130
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,660
There's something

131
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:09,940
I've been really scared of.

132
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,420
I'm scared...

133
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,420
I'm scared you'll suddenly leave us

134
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,590
like Beiyu did.

135
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,390
I'm just a little tired.

136
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,020
I'll be fine after some rest.

137
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:33,990
Then, will you stay in the hospital
for a few days?

138
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:38,060
People will talk.

139
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:41,180
It doesn't matter what people say.

140
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:44,590
After the NCEE, I'll apply for finance
at Jiangzhou University

141
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:46,040
just like you wanted.

142
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,350
I'll earn back all the money
we spend on the hospital stay.

143
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,230
Just promise me you'll go
after I finish the NCEE,

144
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:51,940
okay?

145
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:55,420

than working here for me.

00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,700
life became a lot easier.

559
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:44,180
We're all doing well.
And you're doing well too, right?

560
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:53,950
Beiyu, once Mom's discharged,

561
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:56,300
we'll start fresh.

562
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:58,820
Don't worry about us.

563
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:03,110
(I have faith)

564
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,780
(that everything can begin again.)

565
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:07,550
(Beiyu,)

566
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,860
(if I get the chance,)

567
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,700
(I'll go back to Nanqiao Village)

568
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,860
(and really take a look
at the place you grew up in.)

569
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:37,300
This is where I found your sister.

570
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:46,340
You think if I hadn't found her,

571
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,440
if I hadn't run after her,

572
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,470
what would have happened?

573
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:52,300
What was she thinking in that moment?

574
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:53,950
Mom,

575
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,470
Beiyu has left us for some time now.

576
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:58,700
Let it go.

577
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,700
Let's sit here for a bit.

578
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:16,300
She just stood there like a little bird,

579
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,510
completely still.

580
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:23,510
Head raised, looking at the sky.

581
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:31,700
Maybe she was wondering
what it felt like to fly.

582
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:35,340
She didn't know
how high or how far she could go.

583
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:39,590
She was thinking,

584
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,660
why is the sea as blue as the sky?

585
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,950
Would she be reunited with her parents

586
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:47,380
at the edge of the sky?

587
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,220
It was cold.

588
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,470
She was scared.

589
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:57,180
Below her was an endless drop.

590
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:59,780
She didn't know
if she could make it across.

591
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:06,030
Then, she opened her wings.

592
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,820
I'll take care of that.

593
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:39,340
Mom,

594
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:42,340
this box is for your hospital stay.

595
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,860
This one I'm taking
to Jiangzhou for college.

596
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:47,260
This one's for Yu.

597
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,430
Everything else goes to the new house.

598
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:50,720
I've got a ride arranged.

599
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,470
It's the delivery truck
from the corner store.

600
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:54,510
Ms. Yang's doing us a favor

601
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:55,700
as neighbors.

602
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:58,950
Don't worry.

603
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:01,590
I'm keeping
all the important stuff with me.

604
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:05,950
Get some sleep.

605
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:10,510
Rest well, Mom.

606
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:41,180
Beiyu?

607
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:48,110
Qiao Beiyu! Qiao Beiyu!

608
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:51,150
(Qing,)

609
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:55,340
(this is as far as I can take you.)

610
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:58,860
(The view ahead is beautiful.)

611
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,700
(Take a good look at it for me.)

612
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:05,990
Don't worry.

613
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:09,660
I'll take care of our family

614
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:12,660
