=Reborn=

14
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,080
(Adapted from the serialized work "Reborn"
by Qiang Yu)

15
00:01:35,394 --> 00:01:36,970
53 yuan 20 cents.

16
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,200
78 yuan 70 cents.

17
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,130
79 yuan 50 cents.

18
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:48,330
How much?

19
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,000
That's all?

20
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:53,170
After the opening of the fast-food shop
at the junction,

21
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:56,330
our revenues over the past few days
have been cut in half.

22
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:58,840
I heard that the food they served

23
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,810
was flash-frozen.

24
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:01,560
They just heat them with a microwave.

25
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,770
Even so, they have customers.

26
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,410
I don't understand at all.

27
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,440
I see others are making good money

28
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,160
doing food deliveries for college students.

29
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,930
Why don't we print out
some pamphlets tomorrow

30
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,560
and distribute them to the schools

31
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,210
and residential buildings nearby?

32
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:17,600
Sure.

33
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,250
I guess we have to work harder
for the next few years.

34
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,840
Once we repay our debt

35
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,400
and Qingyu graduates from university,

36
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,530
everything will get better.

37
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,440
Other people's parents
come back from work

38
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,210
with fruits, delicacies,

39
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:32,320
or tonics.

40
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:35,690
But us? We only bring vegetables back

41
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:37,040
for our kids.

42
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,970
I did finish them, didn't I?

43
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,650
I'll attend a parent-teaching meeting
at Jinyu's school this afternoon.

44
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:45,160
Okay.

45
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,720
His teacher said he's a good student.

46
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,970
The school also has
guaranteed university slots.

47
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,680
If he studies hard

48
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,280
and does his best in the cultural class,

49
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,200
he'll stand a chance.

50
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,090
I hope so.

51
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:11,210
Qiao Jinyu.

52
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,000
I want to find Qiao Beiyu's boyfriend,

53
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,720
who's from Nanqiao Village.

54
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,650
I need to know
what he did to Beiyu.

55
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:18,480
What are you up to?

56
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,470
You have to help me out.

57
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:23,410
I don't think we should do this.
How can I help you?

58
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,370
If Mom finds out, she won't let me off.

59
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:26,650
You have to listen to me.

60
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:27,600
What gives?

61
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,040
It's because I'm your elder sister.

62
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,410
It's because
Qiao Beiyu is our elder sister.

63
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:36,090
Don't worry.

64
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,160
You won't be implicated
even if anything does happen.

65
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:41,600
Why do I feel like

66
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,130
you're no longer the same person?

67
00:03:45,128 --> 00:03:53,300
=Episode 5=
(Boyfriend from Nanqiao Village)

68
00:04:07,477 --> 00:04:08,760
Clean it up.

69
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:11,160
I won't.

70
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,970
Was anyone there to witness it?

71
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:14,320
Qiao Qingyu,

72
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,560
I suggest you don't raise your voice.

73
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,000
Sheng is my buddy.

74
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,810
If you offend me,
you'll be offending him too.

75
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:26,520
What are you doing?

76
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,520
Qiao Qingyu.

77
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:30,480
Qiao Qingyu.

78
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,400
What are you doing?

79
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,640
Sheng will teach you
a lesson after this!

80
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,130
What's wrong?

81
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:43,760
Nothing.

82
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,130
Actually, I feel troubled.

83
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,520
I stuffed all the trash
into Ming Sheng's backpack.

84
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,760
But they were the ones
who bullied me first.

85
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,640
Judging from Ming Sheng's personality,
he'll never let me off.

86
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,640
I'm not afraid
that he'll get back at me for this.

87
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,290
I was prepared long ago.

88
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:03,930
But I just feel uneasy.

89
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,170
Am I too timid?

90
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,170
Your imagination
is quite wild, you know?

91
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,400
Sheng isn't like
what you've imagined him to be.

92
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,370
Do you know Ming Sheng as well?

93
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,000
It's more than that.

94
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,200
We're neighbors. We grew up together.

95
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:19,760
You see,

96
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,440
he used the dress I loved the most
when I was a kid

97
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,810
as a mat for his cat.

98
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:25,400
The first tooth Sheng lost

99
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,370
was from a fight with me.

100
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:29,120
I know he's mischievous.

101
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,730
However, he has
a great sense of justice.

102
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,730
He's a loyal friend.

103
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,810
He might look stern and quiet usually.

104
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,930
In reality, he's very kind.

105
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,560
He's very compassionate as well.

106
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,960
Sometimes,

107
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:44,170
I suppose he's quite childish too.

108
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:50,730
Gather around!

109
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:52,810
Previously,
we practiced the leg movements

110
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,560
of the breaststroke on land.

111
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,320
Today, we'll perform
the training in water.

112
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,130
Form three rows.

113
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,560
Depart when you hear the whistle.

114
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:02,170
First row.

115
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:23,050
Straighten your legs.

116
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:30,520
Qiao Qingyu.

117
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:31,960
Focus.

118
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:38,760
Straighten your legs.

119
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,960
You better make it clean.

120
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:54,000
Most of them are just dust.

121
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,520
It's easy to clean.

122
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,640
Do you need me to thank you

123
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,600
for stuffing dust

124
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,760
into Qing Qingyu's backpack?

125
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,200
It's fine.

126
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:06,000
This joke of yours is too much.

127
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,690
Cleaning the backpack is no big deal.

128
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:09,320
Stop bullying Qiao Qingyu.

129
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,850
You spread the word of
what happened to Qiao Beiyu

130
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:12,720
all over the school.

131
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,000
Qiao Qingyu misunderstood me
because of that.

132
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,130
I became your scapegoat.

133
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,000
How should we settle that debt?

134
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,290
Regarding Qiao Beiyu's incident,

135
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,290
I heard it from my friends
from another school.

136
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,200
I blurted it out.

137
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,850
It ended up as gossip in our school.

138
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,850
I never expected her

139
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:28,400
to think that you were the perpetrator.

140
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,560
Sheng, don't do this for real.

141
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,720
My image as the school hunk
is done for, you know?

142
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,320
This is too...

143
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,610
Stop talking. Read your lines.

144
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,320
It's all my fault.

145
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:58,520
I'll bear the fault myself.

146
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,520
It's all my fault.

147
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,520
I'll bear the fault myself.

148
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,370
It's all my fault.

149
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,250
I'll bear the fault myself.

150
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,370
I guess that's enough.

151
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:10,250
I'll spare you this time.

152
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,250
Thank you, sir.

153
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,440
Let me give you a wok
full of my apology.

154
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,400
You can keep it for yourself.

155
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,170
Here you go.

156
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:19,000
Keep it for yourself.

157
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,850
Remember to return it

158
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:21,200
to the madam later.

159
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,200
Remember to wash it.

160
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:23,610
Alright.

161
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,640
(I know he's mischievous.)

162
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,920
(However, he has
a great sense of justice.)

163
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,920
(He's a loyal friend.)

164
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,160
It's all my fault.

165
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,970
I'll bear the fault myself.

166
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,160
You're on duty, right?
Dispose of it for me.

167
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,730
(He might look stern and quiet usually.)

168
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,880
(In reality, he's very kind.)

169
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,450
(He's very compassionate as well.)

170
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,370
Go and borrow a shirt
from our classmates.

171
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,800
If not, you might catch a cold.

172
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:47,040
This month, after deducting costs,

173
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,800
the shop made just
over 5,000 yuan in profit.

174
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,280
If we include the rent, utility bills,

175
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,970
and the expenses of our two kids,

176
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,250
we have less than 1,200 yuan in cash.

177
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,130
In my opinion,

178
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,570
we have to send some money
to Haisheng somehow.

179
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:03,850
He's going to renovate the old house.

180
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,640
Why don't you discuss with him

181
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,520
and tell him to fork out
the money for us first?

182
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,760
We'll pay him back next spring.

183
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:11,520
That's inappropriate.

184
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,970
Wang called you. You didn't pick up.

185
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,000
He called me.

186
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,250
His son is getting married.

187
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:20,370
We've owed him a debt
for quite some time.

188
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,730
It's time for us to repay our debt.

189
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:23,730
I've returned the 3,000 yuan
we borrowed from him.

190
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,640
You see,

191
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,600
the three sons of the family

192
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,960
should be in charge of renovating
the house for our parents.

193
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,680
Judging from
Jiangsheng's current situation,

194
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,850
there's no way to rely on him.

195
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,970
So, you see...

196
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:41,970
What should we do, then?

197
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,880
Let's transfer the 1,200 yuan
we have left

198
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,480
to your brother

199
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,960
and skip our meals. Are you happy now?

200
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,160
That's not what I mean.

201
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:47,800
You see,

202
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:50,400
we should give him some money somehow.

203
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,450
All these years,

204
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,080
Haisheng was the one
who looked after Dad.

205
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,400
Now, you expect me to let him
renovate the house by himself?

206
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:58,760
If so, he'll bring up the past again.

207
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,000
And?

208
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,760
Do we deserve to be bullied?

209
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,370
All of them are the good guys

210
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,400
and we're the evildoers.

211
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:05,920
We deserve

212
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,360
to drown in their pool of saliva
after they finish their gossip.

213
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,250
That's not what I mean.

214
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,360
Why are you being flustered?

215
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,840
Of course you're not flustered at all.

216
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,880
Whenever something happens,

217
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,570
you only know how to hide at the back.

218
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,800
Ladyboss!

219
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:23,730
Eh, Mr. Chen.

220
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,760
Do you still
need your vegetables tomorrow?

221
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,730
Yes, I do.

222
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:28,370
Mr. Chen,

223
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:28,960
great timing.

224
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,730
I was intending
to discuss something with you.

225
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,920
We aren't fussy with
the vegetables you deliver.

226
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,840
Can you count us cheaper
by a few more cents?

227
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,080
Sometimes, we have to throw away

228
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,400
20% of our vegetables due to that.

229
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,330
Do you want your vegetables
delivered or not, then?

230
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:40,160
I do.

231
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,760
Before the teacher arrives for
our morning self-study session,

232
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,040
let's copy this poem first.

233
00:11:58,082 --> 00:11:59,300
(Reflections in Autumn)

234
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,290
(Reflections in Autumn, Yulu)

235
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:30,640
I went out to visit
a few relatives and friends,

236
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,330
and did the same on the third day.

237
00:12:36,734 --> 00:12:40,114
♪You opened a window♪

238
00:12:42,977 --> 00:12:46,342
♪And I saw hope beyond it♪

239
00:12:49,031 --> 00:12:52,457
♪You said something
I couldn't understand♪

240
00:12:55,182 --> 00:12:58,080

♪Only to discover helplessness♪

248
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,330
I was intending

249
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:39,730
to throw this pair of shoes away.

250
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:41,920
But since someone

251
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,730
has cleaned them this well,

252
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:44,850
I suppose I'll do her a favor

253
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,370
and wear them for a few more days.

254
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:51,730
Continue to do my homework
for me this semester.

255
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,640
I'm going to attend the TCF.

256
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,850
I don't have the time.

257
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,800
But don't get me wrong.

258
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,040
That favor I did to get you
the medical record,

259
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,680
I have no intention
of using it this time.

260
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,240
After all, doing homework is way easier

261
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,640
compared to the favor I did for you.

262
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:07,970
I can do your homework for you.

263
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:09,920
However, I need two things in exchange.

264
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,210
The two conditions are simple for you.

265
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:13,850
Tell me about it.

266
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,250
First condition,
borrow me your phone for a few days.

267
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,160
Second condition,

268
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,680
return the letter you found to me.

269
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,970
I can lend you my phone.

270
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,520
What about the letter?

271
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,730
I forgot to bring it here.
I'll look for it back home.

272
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,570
Study hard.

273
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,520
That's what you should focus on.

274
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,490
Sheng.

275
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,250
There's something

276
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,610
I cannot figure out.

277
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:25,730
Analyze it for me.

278
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:26,970
What is it?

279
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:32,250
You see, there's a friend of mine.

280
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,160
He's a guy.

281
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,000
He likes to hide the letters

282
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,130
that someone else
has written to another girl.

283
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:40,210
Don't you think he's out of his mind?

284
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,370
I suppose he only hid the letters
meant for one girl

285
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,800
instead of many girls, right?

286
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,610
Yeah, that's right.

287
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:49,970
He's not out of his mind.

288
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,160
He just fancies her.

289
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,610
Who fancies who?

290
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:55,040
The guy who hid the letter
fancies the girl.

291
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,130
That's nonsense.

292
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,130
I mean,

293
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,640
I know that guy pretty well.
That's impossible.

294
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:06,640
Sometimes,

295
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,490
unnecessary pride can make

296
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:10,570
a person deny what they truly feel.

297
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:13,040
They might deceive other people
or even themselves.

298
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,200
This is what it means
to say one thing and mean another.

299
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,640
So, after all of that,

300
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,160
who's that guy you mentioned?

301
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,920
He doesn't exist.

302
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,370
It's just a plot

303
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:29,160
I saw in the TV drama yesterday.

304
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:32,920
Since when did you fall in love
with TV dramas?

305
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,130
You're blushing.

306
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:41,800
Me? Blushing?

307
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:47,760
I think the weather is too hot.

308
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:50,760
It's normal for one's face
to be flushed.

309
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:52,520
The sun is crazy hot.

310
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,960
You've completed
a lot of surgeries today.

311
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,050
I guess you're exhausted.

312
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,720
Yeah.

313
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,640
I'm exhausted.

314
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:18,570
Today's surgical patient has
a medical history of hepatitis B.

315
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,480
An accident occurred
during arterial access.

316
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,290
The blood splashed into
my eyes by accident.

317
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,330
I've read your
health checkup report for last month.

318
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,400
Your hepatitis B
surface antibody level is over 100,

319
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,370
and you've also received
hepatitis B immunoglobulin.

320
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:37,240
You should be fine.

321
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,130
Don't worry about it.

322
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:55,290
I heard a new amusement park
just opened in the development zone.

323
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:58,010
Since tomorrow's our day off,

324
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:00,920
why don't we take Sheng there

325
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,770
and relax a little?

326
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,920
Alright, understood.

327
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,440
I'll post the announcement now.

328
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,200
The organ donor
who was in the car accident

329
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,240
suddenly fell into a deep coma.

330
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,810
Initial assessment
indicates brain death.

331
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,440
Therefore,

332
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,570
we have to proceed with
the organ transplant by tonight.

333
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:34,600
Dr. Li, notify your team immediately.

334
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,050
The organ transplant surgery
for Tan Qianqian in Bed 6, Ward 2,

335
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,440
has been brought forward to tonight.

336
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,610
Yes. Green channel.
I'll give the approval now.

337
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:43,050
Alright. I appreciate it.

338
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,810
You should at least eat something.

339
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:48,440
You've treated many patients,

340
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,570
but your chronic gastritis
is getting worse and worse.

341
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,440
Oh.

342
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,050
By the way,

343
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,960
Sheng is in a rebellious phase now.

344
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,160
We have a tense relationship.

345
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,810
I'm worried

346
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,610
that he might get more agitated

347
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:08,010
if we reveal our relationship now.

348
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,330
Therefore, I was thinking

349
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:12,160
if I could wait until the NCEE is over

350
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,960
before I reveal our relationship to him.

351
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,960
All kids will grow up one day.

352
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,440
I'm sure he'll understand our feelings.

353
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,920
I'll make arrangements for the surgery.

354
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,960
Okay.

355
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,050
Mom, my teacher said he made a mistake

356
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:01,570
with my student registration info
at the beginning of the term.

357
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:03,000
He wants me to bring our hukou there

358
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,160
so that he can re-confirm it.

359
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,390
They're careless, aren't they?

360
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,840
I'll hand it to you tomorrow morning.

361
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:09,160
No, Mom. You should hand it to me now.

362
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,960
I might forget about it
tomorrow morning.

363
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,330
The teacher has been urging me
to hand it to him.

364
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:15,850
It's just that I forgot about it.

365
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,960
Fine. I'll retrieve it now.

366
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:20,880
I wonder

367
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,610
what's inside that empty head of yours.

368
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:54,400
Ouch!

369
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:56,290
What's the matter?

370
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,400
What happened?

371
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:58,120
Mom.

372
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,120
Did you scald your hand?

373
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,880
I'll take the hukou, then.

374
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,570
My goodness.

375
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:03,810
How did you scald yourself
with such a simple task?

376
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:06,440
Hurry. It'll be fine
if you run cold water on it.

377
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,010
What if there's a scar?

378
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,570
How is it? Did you take pictures of it?

379
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:28,570
Here.

380
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:31,720
I didn't have much time.

381
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:34,130
I only took pictures of
certain items in the drawer.

382
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:35,330
Just make do with it.

383
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:43,760
This is the hospital bill

384
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,200
from Beiyu's last hospital admission.

385
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,240
The total is around 160,000 yuan.

386
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,440
This is probably the money
Jingrui gave to Mom.

387
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,770
He gives Mom pocket money monthly.

388
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:00,000
According to the timeline,

389
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,440
he's been transferring money to Mom
since he started working.

390
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,330
Why did he give us so much money?

391
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:06,610
It's because he's nice to us.

392
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:08,400
Our family has already spent
over 100,000 yuan

393
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,160
just on Beiyu's hospital fee alone.

394
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,570
We owe other people money as well.

395
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:14,160
I'm sure it's because he knows
that our family has it rough.

396
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,640
That's why he's aiding us

397
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,770
by transferring some of his wages to us.

398
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:19,370
He has always been nice to us.

399
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:20,240
Everyone knows that.

400
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,880
Are these all of the pictures you took?
Is that all?

401
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:28,570
It only took Mom

402
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:30,570
a short while to help you
put on medicine.

403
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:33,050
I was almost found out, you know?

404
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:40,960
Qingyu, I don't understand.

405
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,640
Before this, you insisted on finding out

406
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,480
the cause of Qiao Beiyu's death.

407
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,920
Hasn't it already been identified?

408
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,530
Her death was surrounded by mysteries.

409
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:50,960
Oh please. She died from her illness.

410
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,850
It's not like someone murdered her.

411
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:55,610
Don't tell me you can
find a culprit for that.

412
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:57,440
Even if she was muddle-headed

413
00:22:57,770 --> 00:22:59,330
and got herself the wrong boyfriend,

414
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:01,160
she's already dead.

415
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,160
It's pointless to dig up the past.

416
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,400
Just like what Mom had said,

417
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,050
people will forget about it
as time passes.

418
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,770
As per our promise,

419
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:13,720
this is all I'll do for you.

420
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,770
I don't want to be involved any longer.

421
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:17,640
If Mom finds out,

422
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,240
both of us will be done for.

423
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:44,300
(It provided me with warmth.
I want to be a bird in my next life.)

424
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:27,920
Qiao Beiyu.

425
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,130
Qiao Beiyu?

426
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,810
Qiao Beiyu?

427
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:37,960
Qiao Beiyu, is that you?

428
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,240
Qiao Beiyu.

429
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:55,610
Even if I'm alone,

430
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:57,530
I'll bring the truth to light
for your sake.

431
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,640
I'm not just doing it
for the sake of the living.

432
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,610
I'm also doing it for your sake.

433
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:31,720
Mom, my teacher said he made a mistake

434
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,200
with my student registration info
at the beginning of the term.

435
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,640
He wants me to bring our hukou there

436
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,810
so that he can re-confirm it.

437
00:25:37,297 --> 00:25:39,810
Mom, I'll take the hukou, then.

438
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,530
How dare you steal?

439
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:47,010
Who taught you that?

440
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,640
Explain yourself.

441
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,240
Qiao Qingyu.

442
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,050
Come in!

443
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,570
Your brother has already confessed.

444
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:05,240
He took the money

445
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,330
from my drawer.

446
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:08,810
What's with this mobile phone?

447
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:09,640
Where did you get it?

448
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,810
I found it by accident.

449
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:12,570
Where?

450
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:15,570
Last week, in the library.

451
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,120
Last week, in the library?

452
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,080
It's still with you now.

453
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,370
That's called stealing, you know?

454
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,530
You can ask her all you like.
Don't be violent.

455
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,960
How dare you still defend her?

456
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,120
If I keep ignoring her,

457
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,480
she'll be arrested sooner or later!

458
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,370
I'll ask you this one last time.

459
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,240
Where did you get this mobile phone?

460
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,640
Did you buy it with your own money?

461
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,770
How much did you spend on it?

462
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:35,120
Or did someone else give it to you?

463
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:35,920
Explain yourself.

464
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:38,370
I found it in the school.

465
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:40,810
You found it in the school, huh?

466
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:43,330
Fine. I'm not going to the shop today.

467
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:45,290
Come. I'll follow you to your school.

468
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:47,370
Come. We'll know
when we reach your school.

469
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:48,570
That's enough of you.

470
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,400
A mobile phone
doesn't grow on trees, you know?

471
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,330
Your lies are not convincing at all.

472
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:59,130
Hurry.

473
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:03,240
Explain it to your mother.

474
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,160
Your younger brother
is naive and clueless.

475
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:07,160
If he's able to loot drawers now,

476
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,600
who knows what kind of evil deeds
he can commit in the future?

477
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,610
And you.

478
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,850
You're devious even though you're young.

479
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,330
I did tell him to search the drawers.

480
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:16,000
But I didn't tell him
to steal your money.

481
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,960
I merely wanted to know
how Qiao Beiyu died.

482
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:20,770
And...

483
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:21,800
And what?

484
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,330
And who's the culprit behind her death?

485
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:24,330
There's no culprit.

486
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:29,330
Mom.

487
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,920
I found this in the old house.

488
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,570
Where did you get it?

489
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,680
The old house was on fire.

490
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,240
I found it in one of Aunt Qin's drawers.

491
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:48,850
Everything else was burned down.

492
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:50,010
This was the only item left.

493
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:03,680
Mom, were Qiao Beiyu's diary entries

494
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,810
actually true?

495
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:13,130
So what if they are?
So what if they aren't?

496
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:15,640
The dead cannot return to life.

497
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:20,370
In the past, I wasn't willing
to converse with her either.

498
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,850
But now, I understand her feelings.

499
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,400
Outsiders are spreading
untrue rumors about her.

500
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,720
I shouldn't have listened to them.

501
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,640
But I wasn't bold enough to
ask you guys about it.

502
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,520
I searched the drawers

503
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,240
because I wanted to know
what happened.

504
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,610
No matter what happened to her,

505
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:34,720
she shouldn't have
degraded herself like that!

506
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:40,360
I've grown up. I'm no longer a child.
If anything has happened to the family,

507
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,840
you can tell me about it.

508
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,160
I can share your burdens with you.

509
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,400
Qiao Beiyu didn't die from appendicitis.

510
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,840
Her boyfriend from Nanqiao Village
was the culprit, am I right?

511
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:50,610
Qiao Qingyu.

512
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:55,640
Qiao Beiyu did die from appendicitis.

513
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:58,160
Where did you hear
all that nonsense from?

514
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,720
The diagnosis from the People's Hospital

515
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,480
clearly states HIV.

516
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,400
I know that.

517
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,770
You think you're all grown up, huh?

518
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,480
Qiao Qingyu, listen up.

519
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,810
I'll tell you what you need to know.

520
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:12,040
You never need to know
the things you don't need to know.

521
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,720
You just need to keep yourself in check.

522
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:16,810
Look at what you've done.

523
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,330
You taught your brother
how to loot drawers

524
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:20,240
and spy on me secretly.

525
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,960
And, your mobile phone.

526
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,160
It's too much of a coincidence

527
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,680
for you to pick up a new mobile phone

528
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,810
from the ground.

529
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:26,640
What's going on?

530
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,850
Fine. You don't want to tell me?

531
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:35,370
I'll find out when
I arrive at your school.

532
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:36,920
Qiao Qingyu, I'm your mother.

533
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,960
You'll be under my care
as long as I'm still alive.

534
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,960
Qingyu, I've already
spoken with your mother.

535
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:58,330
We'll let this pass

536
00:29:58,330 --> 00:29:59,640
if you tell us the truth.

537
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,320
As for where you get
the mobile phone from,

538
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,880
we won't pursue any charges against you.

539
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,200
Your teacher will never harm you.

540
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,440
Speak now.

541
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:10,530
Qingyu,
there's no one else here right now.

542
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:12,010
If you got it through illegal means,

543
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,130
you should tell us right now.

544
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,130
This way, you're giving yourself
an escape route

545
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:15,880
and another chance.

546
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,840
If you got it legally,

547
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,400
all the more
you should tell us about it.

548
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,050
You'll be proving your innocence too.

549
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:22,370
I found this mobile phone

550
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:23,720
in the library last week.

551
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,680
You picked it up last week.

552
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,840
But now, it's still with you.

553
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,200
You didn't hand it to your teacher.

554
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,610
That's the same as stealing it.

555
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:33,530
No matter if you guys trust us or not,

556
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:35,130
I'll never do something like that.

557
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,200
I'll return the phone
to its rightful owner.

558
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:41,330
Did you see Sun calling Qiao Qingyu

559
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:42,720
to his office just now?

560
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,290
What?

561
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,850
I heard that she had stolen something.

562
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,720
Anyway, once the truth
has been brought to light,

563
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:50,480
she'll definitely be punished.

564
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,880
Who knows? She might be expelled.

565
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,480
(Good afternoon, everyone.)

566
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:57,720
(This is a missing item notice.)

567
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,720
(Last Friday,)

568
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,880
(a student found a Nokia N95 phone)

569
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,720
(in the school library's reading room.)

570
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,640
(If your phone is missing,)

571
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,600
(please come to
the broadcasting room to claim it.)

572
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,090
Your teacher said

573
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:11,640
you were

574
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,570
always alone at school.

575
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,530
That's not good.

576
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:20,960
We come from the countryside.

577
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:23,130
There's no way our family

578
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:25,050
can compare to the others.

579
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:26,680
You know this too.

580
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,720
Your parents aren't that capable.

581
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:30,680
We only opened a noodle shop.

582
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,290
We work our butt off
just to sustain our family.

583
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,130
We can't afford to
buy you anything nice.

584
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,680
But the more things are like this,
the more you need to depend on yourself.

585
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,440
Be the best person you can be

586
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,720
and try your best to obtain good grades.

587
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,010
This way, no matter where you go,

588
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,440
you won't feel inferior.

589
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:55,130
I don't want you

590
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:57,240
to lead a life like mine.

591
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,570
At this age,

592
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,770
girls like you need to
start leading your own lives.

593
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:09,480
You mustn't make a single wrong step.

594
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,530
If not, it'll lead
to countless wrong steps.

595
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,960
I heard that the mobile phone
was returned to its rightful owner.

596
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,240
It was an N95. It's been so many days.

597
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,880
The owner is truly careless.

598
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,850
Who knows?

599
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,240
Let's go to the canteen.

600
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,480
It'll leave a scar behind.

601
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:32,680
Now, you have
to cherish yourself the most.

602
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:35,130
You should listen to me.
I'll never harm you.

603
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,330
Why did you come back with men's shoes?

604
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:54,850
Sheng.

605
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,050
Aren't we playing basketball?

606
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,400
Why did you leave by yourself?

607
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,320
I have something to do.

608
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,720
You're abandoning your friends, huh?

609
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,360
That's not true.

610
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,200
Those shoes are quite trendy.

611
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,290
Let's buy some milk tea.

612
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,240
Mrs. Qiao, we found
the owner of the phone.

613
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:25,770
This is Wang Mumu,
a student from Class 1, Grade 12.

614
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:28,770
The phone that Qiao Qingyu had picked up
belongs to her.

615
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:29,850
Hello, Mrs. Qiao.

616
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:31,810
I left my phone on the library's rack.

617
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:32,920
I forgot to retrieve it.

618
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,090
I'm glad that you found it.

619
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:36,330
My phone is Nokia N95.

620
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:38,120
The front is silver
while the back is black.

621
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,640
There are two scratches on the back.
One is deep, one is shallow.

622
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,090
It was scratched after

623
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:43,640
it fell from my pocket on the bus.

624
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,440
You may take a look
if you don't believe me.

625
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,160
No need for that.
It's good as long as it's yours.

626
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,090
Mumu already told me about it.

627
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:53,130
She did lose the phone by accident.

628
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,640
I suppose the issue is resolved now.

629
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,720
Wang Mumu.

630
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:06,200
Thank you so much.

631
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:11,640
Is this how you thank me?
With empty words?

632
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,680
What should I do?

633
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,640
I don't have much pocket money myself.

634
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:17,930
Qiao Qingyu,

635
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:20,200
you're so adorable when you're serious.

636
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,240
No wonder he loved to bully you.

637
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,490
Someone requested me to help you out.

638
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,320
If you want to thank someone,

639
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:29,450
you should thank him.

640
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:40,760
Those lousy fools from Class 2

641
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,240
wanted to play in a 3v3 match with us.

642
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,530
They're begging for defeat.

643
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:44,530
Sheng,

644
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:46,970
the three-pointer just now was amazing.

645
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,490
I'm all sweaty.

646
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:50,930
All those girls

647
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,320
were ripping my eardrum
with their cheers.

648
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,840
Yeah. I think I look cool
when I play basketball too.

649
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,200
Where are my fans?

650
00:35:03,571 --> 00:35:04,660
(Thank you.)

651
00:35:05,725 --> 00:35:06,680
Thank you.

652
00:35:08,245 --> 00:35:09,760
Look. I wonder who's this stingy.

653
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,930
He only received a bottle of water
as a gift of thanks.

654
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,760
But her handwriting is pretty nice.

655
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:16,840
Maybe it's from your secret admirer.

656
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:20,610
Maybe.

657
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:22,840
Maybe.

658
00:35:34,254 --> 00:35:35,770
(Thank you.)

659
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,050
Can you lower your voice?

660
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:52,970
You're so annoying.

661
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:56,200
What has this got to do with me?
It was Mom.

662
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,450
Mom already left the house.

663
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,360
Yeah. She left with a fire basin.

664
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,410
(At 18:05 on the 24th,
China successfully launched the)

665
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:50,400
(Chang'e-1 satellite into space)

666
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,090
(using a Long March 3A carrier rocket)

667
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:55,320
(from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center.)

668
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:58,410
(Chang'e-1, China's first domestically
developed lunar exploration satellite,)

669
00:36:58,410 --> 00:37:00,130
(was successfully launched,)

670
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,640
(marking the official commencement)

671
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,840
(of the country's
lunar orbiting mission.)

672
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:04,970
Qing,

673
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,160
we're almost done here.

674
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,680
Go back and finish your homework.

675
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:07,970
Okay.

676
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:11,050
Dad, I need to go home
and do my homework too.

677
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:11,320
As if.

678
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,160
You just want to head home
to play video games.

679
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:17,610
Hello. Have a seat.

680
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,280
Noodles for Table 2 are ready.

681
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,640
Coming.

682
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,720
You must be Qingyu.

683
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:31,720
Who are you?

684
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,410
How did you know about my sister's name?

685
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:36,800
You're the son of He
from Nanqiao Village.

686
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:38,890
Your name is...

687
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,050
Mrs. Qiao, my name is He Feihai.

688
00:37:42,731 --> 00:37:45,220
(He Feihai's moves)

689
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,360
I never expected you

690
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,530
to come here today.

691
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,160
I was attending university in Huanzhou.

692
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,610
I just graduated not long ago.

693
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,720
Thank you, Mrs. Qiao.

694
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,320
Mr. Qiao, I heard from Jingrui

695
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,130
that you guys opened a noodle shop
in Huanzhou.

696
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,010
That's why I came here to check it out.

697
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,530
I appreciate it.

698
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:06,680
How are your parents doing?

699
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,840
They're doing pretty good.

700
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:10,840
Your parents are truly blessed.

701
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,480
They managed to raise an undergraduate.

702
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,720
It's worth it no matter
how tiring the process was.

703
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:17,280
I'm way inferior compared to Jingrui.

704
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:21,640
Mr. Qiao, Mrs. Qiao,

705
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:23,130
actually, I came here

706
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:25,010
because

707
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,570
I thought you guys might not know

708
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:30,890
that Beiyu and I were classmates.

709
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:33,050
I only heard about
her passing not long ago.

710
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,010
Please accept my condolences.

711
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:38,970
What about this? Let's drop the past.

712
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,760
Eat up.

713
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,010
I prepared some simple dishes for you.

714
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:47,010
But I followed the original recipe
from our hometown.

715
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:48,090
You can't get it here.

716
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:50,010
I remember now.

717
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:53,490
He Feihai was once Jingrui's underling.

718
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,610
He was always following Jingrui

719
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:56,280
and Beiyu.

720
00:38:57,890 --> 00:38:59,760
Qiao Beiyu wrote in her diary

721
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,760
that the person she loved the most
came to Huanzhou.

722
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:04,200
He Feihai attended
university in Huanzhou.

723
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,800
Could he be Qiao Beiyu's boyfriend,

724
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,200
who was from Nanqiao Village?

725
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:14,010
Don't tell me you're going
to cause trouble again.

726
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:17,640
I don't want Mom
to be angry at me again.

727
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:20,570
Don't worry.
I won't involve you this time.

728
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,490
Go and get him some rice.

729
00:39:41,945 --> 00:39:46,870
(See you at the cafe next to
Huanzhou High School at 6 P.M. on Monday.)

730
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,360
Come. Let me see you off.

731
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,400
Mr. Qiao, it's fine.

732
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:52,760
Your father and I

733
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,280
grew up together.

734
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,010
You don't need to stand on ceremony.

735
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:58,480
In the future, just come to my shop
if you want to eat anything.

736
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:00,050
Alright. Thank you, Mr. Qiao.

737
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:03,400
Feihai, we made some
preserved vegetables.

738
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,450
Please take them with you.

739
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,760
I don't think this is appropriate.

740
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,090
My wife made them. Just take them.

741
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:10,720
Alright.

742
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,610
Thank you, Qingyu and Mrs. Qiao.

743
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,840
I'll head home first.

744
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,280
I'll visit you guys next time.

745
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:18,160
Take care.

746
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,200
They were the champions last time.

747
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:38,920
Let me see.

748
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,050
What are you guys doing here?

749
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,050
We registered our names.

750
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:42,800
(2007 Huanzhou High School
Basketball League)

751
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:43,720
Four men, one team.

752
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,040
Nope. We didn't participate in it.

753
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,410
There's a basketball contest

754
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:47,680
after school today.

755
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:48,930
As the host of the contest,

756
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,160
we have to cheer for

757
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,360
our schoolmates.

758
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:53,570
Okay!

759
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,320
Qingyu, will you watch
the basketball match?

760
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,090
Nope.

761
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,490
Qiao Qingyu doesn't think of herself

762
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:03,410
as a member of Class 5 at all.

763
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,480
Yeah.

764
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,970
Let's go. The match will start soon.

765
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:08,360
Let's go.

766
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,800
Please get me the menu.

767
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:26,800
This is the menu.

768
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,280
Please take a look.

769
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:31,890

770
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,410
