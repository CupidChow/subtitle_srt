00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,080
(Adapted from the serialized work "Reborn"
by Qiang Yu)

15
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,760
Where did you get this?

16
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,590
I had a dream last night.

17
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,480
Qiao Beiyu told me

18
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,950
there was a music box in the attic.

19
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,590
I found it the next day.

20
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:48,640
Do you think she came to me in a dream

21
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:52,000
because she had
some unfinished business?

22
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,230
Or was she trying to tell me something?

23
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,560
Don't be ridiculous.

24
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,310
There's no such thing
as dreams from the dead.

25
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,360
You're the guy in the photo, aren't you?

26
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,030
Of course not!

27
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:02,120
That's impossible.

28
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:03,840
Jinrui,

29
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:07,790
lies come with a price.

00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,480
More to the right. More. Lower.

32
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:03,510
All right.

33
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:04,830
Haisheng.

34
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,600
The couplet for the doorway is ready.

35
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:08,080
Here.

36
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,510
Slow down.

37
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:09,880
Okay. Put it up.

38
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,510
All right.

39
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:12,830
Mom.

40
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:13,920
Here.

41
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,680
Give it to me, Mom.

42
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,760
Put it up.

43
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,320
All right.

44
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,600
Put it up along the wall.

45
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,390
Does this look straight to you?

46
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,670
No, not like that.

47
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:22,560
This one.

48
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,160
Is it straight?

49
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:24,200
That will do.

50
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,440
To the left.

51
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,760
(Blessing)
All right. Looks good.

52
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,920
Make sure this one's straight.

53
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:34,960
Let's see it.

54
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,640
How's this?

55
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,880
(Good Fortune Knocks at Every Door)
More to the right.

56
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:41,950
That will do.

57
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:43,710
All right.

58
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,790
Good fortune knocks at every door.

59
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,360
Good.

60
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,111
(Blessing)

61
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:49,510
Jinrui is a grown man.

62
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,640
He can't act on a whim.

63
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,710
He was fine

64
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,720
during dinner last night.

65
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,480
Yet this morning

66
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,110
he suddenly left for Huanzhou.

67
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,360
There were mice in the house yesterday.

68
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,230
Jinrui probably got scared.

69
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,110
Don't be ridiculous.

70
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:07,950
It's Xiaoyun's last Chinese New Year

71
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,640
with her family before her wedding.

72
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,040
Her parents asked Jinrui

73
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:13,270
to celebrate with them.

74
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,110
It's understandable.

75
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,830
But going to the bride's home
for the New Year?

76
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:18,830
That's inappropriate.

77
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,560
People might think

78
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,800
Jinrui is marrying into their family.

79
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,910
And what's with Xiaoyun?

80
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,710
She let the books get to her head.

81
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:31,150
She said they'd only have one child.

82
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:34,240
It's one thing if they have a son.

83
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:35,950
But what if it's a daughter?

84
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,270
What then?

85
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,640
Jinrui is the eldest grandson.

86
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,080
He's responsible
for carrying on the Qiao family name.

87
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:44,270
Mom.

88
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,390
It's just talk before marriage.

89
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,150
Don't take it seriously.

90
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:51,200
Once they marry,
Xiaoyun will be part of the Qiao family.

91
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,590
She'll have to live
by the Qiao family's rules.

92
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,560
Fanghao has been through this.

93
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,350
She said she'd only have one too,

94
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:00,640
but she went on to have Qing and Yu.

95
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,350
And where do you think you're going?

96
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:18,710
I...

97
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,830
I'm just getting my phone.

98
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,910
Ma'am.

99
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,440
Why are you still here
during the New Year holidays?

100
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:26,960
You have my vote

101
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,360
for Employee of the Year next year.

102
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,360
Don't play dumb with me.

103
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,000
Did you see the message I sent you?

104
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,710
Oh, that's right.
My phone ran out of battery.

105
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:36,080
Yang. Just the person I need.

106
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,000
Assign the new patient to bed 37.

107
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:38,760
Got it.

108
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,830
Have you thought

109
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,200
about what I said?

110
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,270
I'll give Yang a hand.

111
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,470
Head Nurse.

112
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:47,880
Still on the clock?

113
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,590
Perfect timing, Dr. Ming.

114
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:51,880
Talk some sense into Fang.

115
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,910
What's the matter with her?

116
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:58,150
I tried setting her up
with a blind date.

117
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,560
He has a good character.

118
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,320
He comes from a good family too.

119
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,510
But she keeps insisting she's too busy

120
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,590
and refuses to go.

121
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,440
Fate is something

122
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,760
you have to seize.

123
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:08,760
How will you know

124
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,880
if someone's a good match
if you don't even meet them?

125
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,240
Dr. Ming,

126
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:12,680
am I right?

127
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:15,680
Yes.

128
00:06:21,698 --> 00:06:22,200
Dr. Ming.

129
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,470
You really think I should go?

130
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,120
You should give yourself a chance.

131
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:33,710
You might just meet the right person.

132
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:34,910
All right, then.

133
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,240
You decide the time and place, ma'am.
I'll be there.

134
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,560
Lovely.

135
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,800
It's settled, then.

136
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,910
Let's go eat.

137
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,590
We'll go over the details while we eat.

138
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,080
Listen.

139
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,760
You two are a perfect match.

140
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:48,910
He comes from a good family.

141
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:50,350
And

142
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,470
he's a looker.

143
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:53,640
You'll see when you meet him.

144
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:07,560
Dr. Ming.

145
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,800
Fang didn't get pack your meal,

146
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,720
so you came
to mooch instant noodles off me again?

147
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,150
Oh, old friend,

148
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,710
I missed you.

149
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:18,120
I thought I'd check in on you.

150
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:19,640
That won't work on me.

151
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:43,910
Yes?

152
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:44,760
Dr. Ming.

153
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,440
There's a patient in the ER
with a brain injury

154
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,280
and a ruptured liver.

155
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,880
We need you
for an emergency consultation.

156
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,710
I'll be right there.

157
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:00,680
Thanks. Got to go.

158
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,900
(Ming Qiuxin)

159
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:26,680
(Ming Sheng: Happy New Year.)

160
00:08:29,491 --> 00:08:30,534
(Qingyu: Happy New Year.)

161
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,642
(Ming Sheng: What's wrong?)

162
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:51,890
(Ming Sheng: What's wrong?)

163
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,032
(Qingyu: Sometimes,)

164
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,760
(I can't help but feel this way.)

165
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,465
(Me, Qiao Beiyu,
Qiao Jinyu, and Qiao Jinrui.)

166
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,280
(When we succeed,
the adults hold us dear.)

167
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:04,014
(But if we fail,)

168
00:09:04,062 --> 00:09:06,257
(they'd wish we had never been born.)

169
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,754
(Ming Sheng: What happened?)

170
00:09:14,962 --> 00:09:16,750
(I found the person I was looking for.)

171
00:09:19,302 --> 00:09:22,208
(Ming Sheng: The one who hurt Qiao Beiyu?)

172
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:22,882
(Qingyu: Mm.)

173
00:09:23,382 --> 00:09:25,760
(Ming Sheng: What's your next step?)

174
00:09:26,034 --> 00:09:27,017
(Qingyu: I don't know.)

175
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,470
(Pursuing justice will mean)

176
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:32,870
(taking on the entire Qiao family.)

177
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,607
(Qingyu: Everyone keeps telling me)

178
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:36,720
(Qingyu: to forget Beiyu.)

179
00:09:36,851 --> 00:09:38,742
(To stop dwelling on
what she went through.)

180
00:09:39,431 --> 00:09:42,157
(They say that's the right thing to do.)

181
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,694
(Ming Sheng,
what would you do if doing what's right)

182
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,440
(meant going against what's just?)

183
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,870
(If something isn't just,)

184
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:03,160
(how can it be right?)

185
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:36,200
It's lit!

186
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,950
It's pretty, isn't it?

187
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:57,750
All right.

188
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:58,870
Wasn't that nice?

189
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:01,040
Why did you only buy one, Jinrui?

190
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,280
You only gave me enough for one, Mom.

191
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:04,920
Jinrui.

192
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:07,110
Come with me to buy more.

193
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,320
Okay, Grandpa.

194
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,870
Take it easy, Dad.

195
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,040
He's like a kid again.

196
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:12,520
That he is.

197
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:13,990
No more fireworks, okay?

198
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,950
No more. There, there.

199
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,470
Come here, Yu.

200
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,800
Let your grandmother hold you.

201
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,590
Come here.

202
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,080
Good boy.

203
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,630
It's pink.

204
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,710
He was scared just now,

205
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,110
and now he thinks it's pretty.

206
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,280
Have an orange, Mom.

207
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:31,280
I want this.

208
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,680
Eat it slowly. It's cold.

209
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:35,630
There's something I want
to discuss with you, Mom.

210
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:39,560
Fanghao and I have some savings now.

211
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,350
The noodle shop is doing well.

212
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:42,920
We were thinking

213
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,830
about bringing Bei back with us

214
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,200
to Shunyun.

215
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:50,110
She's doing just fine here.

216
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:51,680
Why bring her to Shunyun?

217
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:56,110
Do you think we're mistreating Bei?

218
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:56,920
No.

219
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:59,710
Or do you think
we'd skimp on Beiyu's living expenses?

220
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:00,680
Not at all.

221
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,440
We just didn't want you
to get too worn out.

222
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,950
I'm perfectly all right.

223
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:06,750
It's lively having the kids around.

224
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:09,280
Besides, Beiyu was always close
to Jinrui growing up.

225
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,560
They can keep each other company.

226
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,800
You two are out there

227
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,320
making money to support the family

228
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,350
while raising three kids.

229
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:18,830
Can you manage?

230
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:19,400
We can.

231
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:21,400
Don't let Yu suffer because of it.

232
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:24,110
How can you say that, Yanfen?

233
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,630
All three of them are my children.

234
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,350
I love all of them.

235
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,630
Beiyu is growing up.

236
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,440
I just want to be closer to her.

237
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,160
We can't let Yu suffer no matter what.

238
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,350
Can you really take care

239
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:40,040
of three kids?

240
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:40,990
We can, Mom.

241
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:49,990
How about this?

242
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,710
Take Bei with you,

243
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,520
but leave Qing here with us.

244
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,280
Qing is still too young.

245
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:58,920
She'll just give you trouble.

246
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:01,110
Why don't we ask Bei?

247
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:02,710
Bei,

248
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:05,560
will you go home with your parents

249
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,870
and let Qing stay behind?

250
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,870
Say it.

251
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,590
Say you want Qing to stay.

252
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,470
I don't want to go to Shunyun.

253
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:41,040
See? Bei is so sensible.

254
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:41,990
She can stay here

255
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:44,280
and keep Jinrui company.

256
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,110
That's great.

257
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,160
I don't know what you two were thinking.

258
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,630
Have an orange,

259
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,520
Bei.

260
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,400
Yummy, isn't it?

261
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:03,520
Good boy.

262
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,950
(Ming Sheng,)

263
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:23,440
(I know what I have to do.)

264
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:28,350
(In so many moments
I never even noticed,)

265
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,320
(Beiyu was protecting me.)

266
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,200
(Now,)

267
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,590
(I want to do the right thing for her.)

268
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,160
Ancestors,

269
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:01,990
today is the first day
of the Chinese New Year.

270
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,830
I've brought the Qiao family descendants
to pay respects.

271
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,400
We give thanks
to our ancestors' blessings.

272
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,440
You've been part of the Qiao family
for over ten years,

273
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:24,950
married to me for over ten years,

274
00:15:27,511 --> 00:15:29,005
and we've fought for over ten years.

275
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:31,202
(Tomb of Qin Wenqiu,
Wife of Qiao Jiangsheng)

276
00:15:31,251 --> 00:15:33,280
I treated you well, didn't I?

277
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,520
Yet you got tired of me

278
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:40,200
and left without a word.

279
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,600
(Tomb of Qin Wenqiu,
Wife of Qiao Jiangsheng)

280
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,200
Wenqiu,

281
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,520
you're now resting
in the Qiao family's ancestral grave.

282
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,830
I'm burning this for you. Accept it.

283
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,230
Buy whatever you like for yourself.

284
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,710
If we meet again in the next life,

285
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,630
I'll take care of you again.

286
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:14,830
You like kids.

287
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:18,080
We'll have one together

288
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,470
and raise them well.

289
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,230
I have to go.

290
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,350
I'll visit you again.

291
00:16:38,305 --> 00:16:41,100
(Tomb of Qin Wenqiu,
Wife of Qiao Jiangsheng)

292
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:11,280
Move that flower pot, Jiangsheng.

293
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,240
Take a good look inside.

294
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,520
We've searched twice already.

295
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,000
If a ring that big was lost at home,

296
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,670
we'd have found it already.

297
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,520
Are you sure you didn't lose outside
somewhere else, Yanfen?

298
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,430
I didn't even go out.

299
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,240
Where are you going?

300
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,400
Where else?

301
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,350
School's back in session.
I'm going back to school.

302
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:29,870
Wait.

303
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:33,670
That outfit and bag you're wearing.

304
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,320
They're new, aren't they?

305
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,870
Where did you get the money to buy them?

306
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,590
Aunt Yanfen,

307
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,430
are you seriously blaming me

308
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:43,000
for losing your gold ring?

309
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,870
That's a stretch even for me.

310
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:47,590
Don't get snarky with me.

311
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,080
Where did all that stuff come from?

312
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,190
Where else?

313
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,590
My boyfriend bought them for me.

314
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,040
Listen to her!

315
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,480
The audacity of that girl!

316
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:02,960
Calm down, Dad.

317
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:05,720
Found it.

318
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:09,390
Yanfen.

319
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,480
It was here all along.

320
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,180
(Tomb of Qin Wenqiu,
Wife of Qiao Jiangsheng)

321
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,320
Aunt Qin.

322
00:18:23,205 --> 00:18:25,150
Thank you for looking after Qiao Beiyu.

323
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:52,910
(Would you approve)

324
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,080
(of my decision?)

325
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,350
(To cover up Jinrui's parentage,)

326
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,910
(they chose to sacrifice you.)

327
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,240
(I'll make everyone)

328
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,480
(who hurt you pay.)

329
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,320
(This isn't just for you.)

330
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,720
(It's for me too.)

331
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,150
(I just want to understand)

332
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,000
(how the world works.)

333
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,934
(Qingyu: Are you there?)

334
00:19:39,028 --> 00:19:42,162
(Ming Sheng, I have a plan.)

335
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:46,708
(Ming Sheng:
Qiao Qingyu, do what you want to do.)

336
00:19:47,682 --> 00:19:49,257
(I'll always be behind you.)

337
00:19:53,951 --> 00:19:54,651
(Qingyu: Okay.)

338
00:20:03,831 --> 00:20:05,570
(Daily Fresh Fruit)

339
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,000
Mom. Dad.

340
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,240
We're back.

341
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:12,390
Xiaoyun's here.

342
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,000
Mrs. Qiao.

343
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,350
Dad.

344
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,320
I've missed you.

345
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,630
I've missed you too, Mrs. Qiao.

346
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,150
"Mrs. Qiao"?

347
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,320
It's "Mom" to you now.

348
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:21,720
That's right.

349
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:22,800
Xiaoyun,

350
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,830
Jinrui said he bought me a gift.

351
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:25,430
Where is it?

352
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,480
Ask him about it.

353
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,160
It's so impolite
to demand gifts from guests

354
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,240
the moment they arrive.

355
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,830
It's okay, Mom. I'm not a guest anymore.

356
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:33,200
We're family now.

357
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:33,800
You're right.

358
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,240
I'll make you some tea.

359
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,560
I'll take that for you, Xiaoyun.

360
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:38,670
I'll do it.

361
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:43,280
Will you be staying here with us?

362
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,040
Jinrui and I talked it over.

363
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,110
We'll stay in his new house first.

364
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,520
We'll move here
when the wedding takes place.

365
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,520
That's a shame.

366
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,320
A lot of guests will be visiting
over the next few days.

367
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,040
Buy some candied fruits
and sunflower seeds

368
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:58,800
to entertain them.

369
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:00,240
Use the rest

370
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,670
to buy something for yourselves.

371
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:03,480
Jinrui is so generous!

372
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:06,870
Come on, Qingyu.

373
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,150
Let's go.

374
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,830
Come and have some tea.

375
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,480
You must be tired after the long trip.

376
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,000
I'm fine.

377
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,040
Have a seat.

378
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,190
Come here, Jinrui!

379
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:18,630
Coming.

380
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:22,760
Ten for this. Ten for that.

381
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,360
I'll take both.

382
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,000
Certainly.

383
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:25,830
Qing, Yu, you're back.

384
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:26,390
Mm.

385
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:28,390
All right.

386
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,720
You're back, Yu.

387
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,520
I'm going to get some popping candy.

388
00:21:43,031 --> 00:21:44,660
(Xixi Convenience)

389
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,760
Got any popping candy, ma'am?

390
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:51,320
(Print Services)

391
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,000
(Notice: Gone back
to my hometown for New Year's.)

392
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,200
(Will return after the 15th day
of the first lunar month.)

393
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:08,250
(Print Services)

394
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,000
Check this out, Qingyu!

395
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:15,670
Try some.

396
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,000
I don't want it.

397
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:18,830
Why not?

398
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:19,920
It's Jinrui's treat.

399
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,830
Might as well enjoy it.

400
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:22,190
Here.

401
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,000
I don't want it!

402
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,320
Just take it.

403
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,280
I said no.

404
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,240
Thank you.

405
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:52,390
My mom said music is her dream.

406
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,830
She'll always put music first.

407
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,190
What about you? What's your dream?

408
00:22:59,320 --> 00:22:59,910
My dream?

409
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,670
For the longest time,

410
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:06,040
I had no idea what I wanted.

411
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:08,080
Just like most people,

412
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,110
I was going through life on autopilot.

413
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:15,000
It was Anna.
Her love for music taught me

414
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,800
what it means to love.

415
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,320
Before meeting her,

416
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:21,040
I didn't have a dream.

417
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:23,080
But after meeting her,

418
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:24,960
she became my dream.

419
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:31,670
I'd do anything

420
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,560
to help her achieve her dreams.

421
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:37,910
I'll go give her a hand.

422
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,560
Thanks for coming all this way,

423
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,000
Mumu.

424
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:14,000
There's no need for that between us.

425
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,870
Especially since
this is something important.

426
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,560
Is everything written
in here true, Qingyu?

427
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,670
Yes.

428
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,870
Are you really going through with this?

429
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,080
Have you thought about

430
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,240
what exposing all this

431
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:30,670
will do to Qiao Jinrui?

432
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:32,080
To your whole family?

433
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,830
No matter what,

434
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,080
your cousin is successful

435
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:36,760
and promising.

436
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:38,720
He is about to get married.

437
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,830
His whole future is just beginning.

438
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:43,080
Your uncle's family,

439
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,670
your grandparents, and your parents.

440
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,280
The last thing they want is for the past

441
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,520
to be dredged up again.

442
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,960
I have to do it.

443
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,670
I've always thought

444
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:58,150
you and Ming Sheng were alike.

445
00:24:58,630 --> 00:24:59,640
You two will do anything

446
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,960
for what you believe is right.

447
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:02,800
Here.

448
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:04,110
Take it.

449
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:05,190
Best of luck.

450
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:07,280
Thank you.

451
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,670
I have to go.

452
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,320
Safe trip back.

453
00:25:25,962 --> 00:25:30,820
(A Sorrow We Must Never Forget)

454
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:52,800
Um...

455
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,150
Have you decided how much

456
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:56,590
to put in the red envelope

457
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:57,870
for Jinrui's wedding tomorrow?

458
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,720
Only thinking about that now?

459
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,110
I've already prepared it.

460
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,670
How much are you giving him?

461
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,080
Don't worry about it.

462
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:08,040
Should I ask Jiangsheng?

463
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,000
We can't give too little.
It'll look bad.

464
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,910
How much are you giving him?

465
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,670
Aunt Fanghao.

466
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:41,350
Can I come in?

467
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:42,040
Of course.

468
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:54,800
Jinrui,

469
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:56,960
you'll be married soon.

470
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:01,910
Just a little something
from your uncle and me.

471
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,520
You must accept it.

472
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,320
Thank you, Aunt Fanghao.

473
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:13,680
(Rural Credit Union)
We've saved quite a bit over the past two years.

474
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:16,440
I... I can't accept this.

475
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,390
This is my way of making amends
with your family.

476
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:19,760
I can't take it back.

477
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:23,630
Listen to me, Jinrui.

478
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:27,760
When that thing
with you and Bei happened,

479
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,110
I just wanted to find you

480
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:32,870
and ask in person

481
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:34,150
what was really going on.

482
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,720
When I got here,
your mom refused to let me see you.

483
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:39,390
You avoided me
when I went to your college.

484
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:41,080
At that point,

485
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,590
I already had a feeling.

486
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,670
Then, you started working.

487
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,080
One day,
you suddenly showed up in Shunyun,

488
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,240
begging us to forgive you,

489
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,350
and insisted we take this passbook.

490
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,150
I didn't want to take it.

491
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:55,910
Your uncle accepted it.

492
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:56,910
Do you remember that?

493
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:58,830
He told me

494
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,240
that no matter what,
you were still just a kid

495
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,590
and deserved a chance
to make things right.

496
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,480
Your uncle said
we'd hold onto the money for you

497
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,960
and give it back when you needed it.

498
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,040
You're getting married soon.

499
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,520
No better time to return it than now.

500
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,870
I'll take my leave now.

501
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:14,080
Aunt Fanghao...

502
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:14,760
Jinrui.

503
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,590
Is my wedding gown here yet?

504
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,080
Aunt Fanghao.

505
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,720
You're back. I'll let you two get busy.

506
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,280
What was that about?

507
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,320
Nothing.
She just came to congratulate us.

508
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,000
Oh, my dress is here!

509
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:40,590
Yanfen,

510
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:43,800
I heard our village's Secretary
will be officiating

511
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,760
Jinrui's wedding.

512
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:47,960
More than that.
Jinrui's boss will be there too.

513
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,870
Not everyone gets
that kind of treatment.

514
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,080
These are all big shots.

515
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,080
Indeed.

516
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,800
Marrying a city girl
makes all the difference.

517
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,800
We're benefiting just by association.

518
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,350
That's right.

519
00:28:58,150 --> 00:28:58,870
Benefiting?

520
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,520
If anyone's benefiting,
it's from Jinrui.

521
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:02,560
All those leaders

522
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,520
are coming because of him.

523
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:07,320
What's this about "benefiting", Grandma?

524
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:09,040
Qing's here.

525
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,960
We were just talking about Jinrui.

526
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,280
The future of the Qiao family

527
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,000
will depend on him.

528
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,110
Not necessarily.

529
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:16,000
Qingyu.

530
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,630
Go upstairs and do your homework.

531
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,000
I already finished my homework.

532
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:22,910
Then take the box of wedding sweets
to the storage room.

533
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:29,800
Look.

534
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,560
We bought only
the most expensive sweets.

535
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,320
We can't even bring ourselves
to eat them.

536
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,870
Do you think one box is enough?

537
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:36,910
I'll take that.

538
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:42,560
Thanks.

539
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:43,670
Qing.

540
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,390
I was young. I didn't know any better.

541
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:55,910
I hurt Beiyu.

542
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,080
I don't know if your parents

543
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,280
told you this.

544
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,390
All these years,
I've been hiding it from my parents,

545
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:03,160
and trying my best
to make it up to all of you.

546
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:06,670
I understand your resentment.

547
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,520
But we're still family.

548
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,960
Beiyu's gone for good.

549
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:12,560
Qing.

550
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:14,870
I just want a chance

551
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,590
to take care of your family
on Beiyu's behalf.

552
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,000
I'll do everything I can to make amends.

553
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,480
You'll do anything

554
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:25,110
to make it up to Beiyu?

555
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,040
Of course.

556
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,560
All right.
At the end of the day, we're family.

557
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,430
Everyone's busy out there.

558
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:59,110
Yet here you are slacking off.

559
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,150
Well, they couldn't find me.

560
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,150
By the way, Qingyu,
I discovered a secret.

561
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:07,240
Everyone's too scared

562
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,560
to come into this room.

563
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:13,110
I think they're overreacting.

564
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,040
They won't step foot in here

565
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,760
just because Aunt Qin used to live here.

566
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:18,590
They're not scared.

567
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:20,150
They're guilty.

568
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:24,830
You're a big boy now, Yu.

569
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,350
You're the only boy in the family.

570
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,520
You need to take on more responsibility
for Mom and Dad.

571
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:31,240
They're getting older by the day.

572
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,910
Mom's always had back and waist pain.

573
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:36,190
Dad bottles everything up inside.

574
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,560
Hold up. What do you mean?

575
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,240
What do you mean, "the only boy"?

576
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,430
Are you dumping everything on me
just because you can't get your name

577
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:45,520
in the genealogy book?

578
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,350
Being a man comes
with a lot of pressure too.

579
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,830
You can have my spot
in the genealogy book if you want.

580
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:56,240
What on earth is going on
in that head of yours?

581
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,630
Even if I'm smart,
you've whacked me silly.

582
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:07,670
That's the last time I whack you anyway.

583
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:18,390
Mom.

584
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,320
Tea for you.

585
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:21,590
Thanks.

586
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:22,000
It's hot.

587
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,520
All right.

588
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,110
Mind the heat.

589
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:28,150
You could stay a few more days.

590
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,350
I could take you
to visit some nearby colleges.

591
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,670
Once you're there in person,

592
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,760
you might have a different perspective.

593
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,280
It's fine.

594
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,520
I've already booked my flight anyway.

595
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,200
You came when I had my performance.

596
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,280
I didn't even get
to spend time with you properly.

597
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:44,560
Give me another chance.

598
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:49,040
Once I apply to college here,

599
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,720
we'll have plenty of time
to see each other.

600
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:52,280
Besides,

601
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:54,870
I have something more important to do.

602
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:56,560
Something more important?

603
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:57,830
What is it?

604
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:01,190
Well, it's a secret.

605
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,910
A secret?

606
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,720
Now you've piqued my curiosity.

607
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:12,630
Relax.

608
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,430
I won't pry.
Everyone's got their share of secrets.

609
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,190
Mom.

610
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,000
All these years have passed.

611
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:23,910
I've grown up too.

612
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:26,080
And...

613
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,760
I have a feeling

614
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:33,080
that the right person for you

615
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,430
is right by your side.

616
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:37,960
You're quite the worrier.

617
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:41,320
Worry about yourself, okay?

618
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,150
Fine. I was just saying anyway.

619
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:02,760
Mom.

620
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,590
Are your shoulders hurting again?

621
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,150
I'll massage them for you.

622
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:10,520
I'm fine.

623
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:15,040
Why are you still up?

624
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,710
Jinyu's snoring kept me up.

625
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:17,790
Where's Dad?

626
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:20,230
Probably off drinking

627
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:21,150
with your uncles.

628
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,790
I'm fine. You don't have to do this.

629
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:27,880
Mom.

630
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,920
Why did you marry Dad?

631
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,480
What brought that up?

632
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,790
Aunt Yanfen said

633
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:38,230
you didn't want to have so many kids.

634
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,790
If that's the case,

635
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,520
why did you marry into the Qiao family?

636
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,630
My parents passed away
when I was young.

637
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,520
I grew up with my grandmother.

638
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:54,790
We were poor.

639
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,230
I had no money for school.

640
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,710
So, I became a temp worker.

641
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:02,960
I met your father

642
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,960
at the power supply station in town.

643
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,710
I was only 20-something that year.

644
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,190
I had to do
all the dirty and tiring tasks

645
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:14,150
in the canteen.

646
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,790
Your dad couldn't stand to see it
and came over to help me.

647
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,230
One day, he asked me.

648
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:27,270
He said he was a full-time employee

649
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:29,440
with a good salary and benefits.

650
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,630
If we get married,
we can even get a house.

651
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,750
That's how
I somehow ended up saying yes.

652
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:46,790
After that,
your grandparents wanted grandchildren.

653
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,110
Then, Jinyu came along.

654
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:51,920
But

655
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:55,440
who would've thought your father would...

656
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:58,670
Do you regret it?

657
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:01,000
What good is regret?

658
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:04,440
Life has to go on.

659
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:07,440
Qingyu.

660
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,150
I know you've never gotten over

661
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:13,400
what happened to your sister.

662
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:18,710
But sometimes,
you just have to let things go.

663
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:21,710
Not everything in life
is black and white.

664
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:25,920
Leave it alone

665
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:31,670
long enough, and eventually, it fades.

666
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:36,670
I understand.

667
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,750
Let me give you another massage.

668
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,670
I'm fine.

669
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,840
You don't need to do this.

670
00:37:34,051 --> 00:37:35,920
(A Sorrow We Must Never Forget)

671
00:37:57,082 --> 00:37:59,940
(Double Happiness)

672
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,508
(Ming Sheng: After tomorrow,)

673
00:39:22,665 --> 00:39:25,322
(everyone will know everything.)

674
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:27,602
(Aren't you scared?)

675
00:39:29,665 --> 00:39:30,500
(Qingyu: No.)

676
00:40:13,851 --> 00:40:17,210
(The Wedding
of Qiao Jinrui and Nie Xiaoyun)

677
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:23,270
Look who's here, Qiao!

678
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:23,790
Haisheng.

679
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:25,310
Congratulations!

680
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,670
Come in! Join the celebration!

681
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,310
It's a blessed day.

682
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:29,960
Congratulations.

683
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:30,680
It's a good day.

684
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,590
Secretary,

685
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,920
it's a great honor for the couple

686
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,480
to have you officiate their wedding.

687
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,000
It's my duty.

688
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:38,190
Jinrui is the pride

689
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:40,270
of Nanqiao Village.

690
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:42,960
Jinrui is a filial boy.

691
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,040
He insisted on having the banquet here
in the village.

692
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,080
Everyone here watched him grow up.

693
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:48,310
It's only right

694
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:50,560
that he invite all of us to his wedding.

695
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:54,190
Jinrui has always been ahead

696
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,920
in everything he does.

697
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:58,400
Studies, work, and now even marriage.

698
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,270
This year, they get married.

699
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:03,750
Next year,
they'll give you a healthy grandson.

700
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,080
That would be wonderful!

701
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,670
Not just one. Twins! A boy and a girl.

702
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:10,960
Let's take your word for it.
Double the blessings!

703
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:14,000
Do come in.

704
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:14,920
Mr. Qiao.

705
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:15,680
Secretary.

706
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,880
Congratulations are in order.

707
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,590
We better hurry and finish your makeup.

708
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:21,920
The ceremony's about to start.

709
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,040
I've done makeup for a lot of brides,

710
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,120
but this is the first time
I've seen one this pretty.

711
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:27,520
Your skin is flawless.

712
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:28,920
You'll surely be

713
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,040
the most beautiful of all in Shunyun
at the wedding.

714
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,680
Xiaoyun's from Huanzhou.

715
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,190
She's a Huanzhou beauty born and bred.

716
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,590
A small county like Shunyun

717
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:37,360
can't compare.

718
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,400
Of course.

719
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,790
Shall we go with a peach blossom palette
for your makeup?

720
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:42,400
Okay.

721
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,560
Where are the bridal shoes?

722
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:51,310
Were they left in the car?

723
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,360
The car is parked
at the village entrance.

724
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:54,440
I'll take you there.

725
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,560
We don't have time to delay.

726
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:56,000
Okay.

727
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,040
Qingyu.

728
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:01,790
Could you

729
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:02,670
please straighten

730
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:03,670
Xiaoyun's dress hem?

731
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,240
Help her put on this pendant too.

732
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,000
