(Adapted from the serialized work "Reborn"
by Qiang Yu)

15
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,660
I hate my dad.

16
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:39,660
I hate him for being a layabout.

17
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,860
All he did was hurt me and my mom.

18
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:46,710
But now

19
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:49,860
I hate myself more.

20
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,660
There's nothing I can do.

21
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,190
I can only allow it to get worse.

22
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,500
Did you know?

23
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,340
Although I still find

24
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,180
seeking justice for Beiyu

25
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,780
a righteous thing to do,

26
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,710
what I did has hurt my father.

27
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,900
That's a fact.

28
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,300
My mom's condition is getting worse.

29
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:25,300
She'll always get worked up

30
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,230
and fight with my dad.

31
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:30,460
And my brother has avoided
to come home from school.

32
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,740
I have no idea what I'll do after this.

33
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,430
I used to be mad

34
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:40,740
because I thought
they'd distorted the truth

35
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,990
and refused to own up to their mistake.

36
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,780
However, I'm no longer angry.

37
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:51,780
Do all of us face the same thing?

38
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:56,900
Even though

39
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,180
we're not some ignorant kids,

40
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:03,460
we're still not able to solve a problem

41
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:04,860
as easily as adults do?

42
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,670
Well,

43
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:10,460
it's not even easy
to open up to someone.

00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:18,150
Do you think there's an easy solution
to all these problems?

00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,180
Or

46
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,620
everything will be fine
when we grow up?

47
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,740
I don't know either.

48
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:26,340
After all

49
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,710
this is also my first time growing up.

00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:33,340

Alright, these are
the trigonometric formulas.

79
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,190
There are
five trigonometric formulas in total

80
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,950
that you must memorize by heart.

81
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,510
Now let's go over the first question.

82
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:41,900
We're given point A: (1, √5),

83
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,510
and Y equals 2X, on 2PX.

84
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,600
Find the distance from point A to the directrix of C.

85
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,440
We're looking
for the distance to the directrix.

86
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,720
Make sure you remember that.

87
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,900
Chen Hao, what are you doing?

88
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,460
Did you fall asleep?

89
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,460
Stand up.

90
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,390
You're copying notes
and still managing to sleep?

91
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,070
Show me
how you can sleep while standing.

92
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,100
Ye Zilin!

93
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,280
You're having so much fun, huh?

94
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,340
Teach me how to solve this.

95
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:09,420
It should be Y squared equals 5X, right?

96
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:10,520
You're doing trig,

97
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,580
and you can somehow
link it to the directrix distance?

98
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,780
That's pretty impressive!

99
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,630
Well, that should be...

100
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,710
Can you really
separate algebra and geometry?

101
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,870
Ah, algebra and geometry...

102
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,540
Everyone else, focus on the lesson.

103
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:21,760
You two, stay standing.

104
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,710
If you don't understand,
make sure to take notes.

105
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,660
Now let's break down the first problem.

106
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:28,780
Y squared minus 2X
equals fifteen, equals zero.

107
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,420
So, what can we derive from this?

108
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:34,187
(50 days left
until the college entrance exam)

109
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,220

00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,000

(Mental Health)
what we see is the truth.

127
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,220
When others don't share our opinion,

128
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:14,270
we always feel angry and misunderstood.

129
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,870
But actually, most of the time,

130
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,680
there's no right or wrong
between two parties

131
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,830
that hold different opinions.

132
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,660
Just like this apple.

133
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,400
One side's red, the other side's yellow.

134
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,710
If you only look from one angle,

135
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,660
you'll never see the whole picture.

136
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,980
From different perspectives,

137
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:32,020
it can look completely different.

138
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,350
So, everyone,

139
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,940
try to step out
of your own point of view

140
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,540
and learn to understand and communicate.

141
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,390
That's a really important step

142
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,870
on the journey to growing up.

143
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:55,780
Oh, right.

144
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,520
A comic café just opened near my place.

145
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,990
Do you want to visit it this Saturday?

146
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,020
Sure.

147
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:01,990
But I still have homework to do.

148
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,990
You can do it on Sunday.

149
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:09,470
Why aren't you saying anything?

150
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,230
Well... Read it yourselves.

151
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,080
(The final death of a person
is being forgotten.)

152
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,080
(No matter how joyful the celebration,
it cannot cover up monstrous sins...)

153
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:21,300
Poor Qiao Beiyu.

154
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,110
Where did this article come from?

155
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,480
Someone posted it on the forum.

156
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,390
The reason Qiao Qingyu ran away
over winter break

157
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:32,150
was because she spread this article

158
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,270
at her cousin's wedding

159
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,390
and ruined the whole thing.

160
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,150
How brave of her.

161
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,540
And we even made fun of her for it.

162
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,510
Do you think we' been like

163
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,240
the kind Ms. Le Fan described?

164
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,990
We've been focusing
on one side of the story

165
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,600
and ended up
misunderstanding Qiao Qingyu.

166
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,110
If you're here to settle a score,

167
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,110
I've already bowed and apologized.

168
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:20,020
If you're here for forgiveness,

169
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:22,630
the only one in this world
who could forgive you

170
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:23,660
is already dead.

171
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:28,300
I'm about to leave Huanzhou, Qing.

172
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,350
I just came to say goodbye.

173
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,990
I don't know
what you think about Nanqiao Village.

174
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:37,900
You and Yu
were both born and raised in Shunyun.

175
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,660
Maybe Nanqiao Village

176
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:42,540
was just an old hometown

177
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,470
you reluctantly visited during holidays.

178
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:48,590
You don't really understand

179
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,270
the complex customs
and traditions there.

180
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,990
But you know what?

181
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:55,180
Your clarity and courage

182
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:56,870
come from having a way out.

183
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,820
You could leave any time.

184
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,270
We didn't have that choice.

185
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,940
Bei and I grew up together.

186
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:12,230
We're the closest ones
in each other's lives.

187
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,230
After college,

188
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,590
we naturally became a couple.

189
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:22,940
Later, our family found out.

190
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,350
And when she needed me the most,

191
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,020
I backed down.

192
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,820
I struggled so hard
just to leave Nanqiao Village.

193
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,590
I just didn't have the courage
to give up everything for her.

194
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,270
I won't make excuses for myself.

195
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,270
I deserve everything
that's happened to me.

196
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:47,350
Honestly, when you exposed everything,

197
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,510
I actually felt relieved.

198
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,940
It felt like the huge weight
hanging over me

199
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,110
had finally dropped.

200
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,230
Thank you, Qing.

201
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,780
You set me free.

202
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:05,350
And I hope my departure
will set you free too.

203
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,780
This is the only thing left of Beiyu's.

204
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,870
You're more worthy
of keeping it than I am.

205
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:55,750
(Qing, stop dwelling on the past.)

206
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,700
(You have to finish
what Beiyu couldn't.)

207
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:01,590
(Live the life she never could.)

208
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:04,540
(That's what she wanted the most.)

209
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,990
Alright, everyone.

210
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:03,750
The tense we're learning today

211
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,350
is called the pluperfect.

212
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:07,540
Before we dive into it,

213
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:10,700
let's review something we've learned,

214
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,180
the past perfect tense.

215
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,630
Thanks for last night.

216
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:16,660
Alright, repeat after me.

217
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,700
"I love you" in French.

218
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,540
It goes like this.

219
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,590
I love you.

220
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:44,150
Wang Mumu,
did you really call the cops on me?

221
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,420
You ungrateful brat!

222
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,420
Hands off me!

223
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,660
Why? What're you doing?

224
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,390
Hit me! Go ahead, hit me!

225
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:53,870
Get over there!

226
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:56,150
Crying again? That's all you ever do.

227
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,630
Is there anything else you can do?

228
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:00,080
We're all neighbors!

229
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,060
It's just one bowl of noodles,
how much can it cost?

230
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,870
You brought friends!
Was it just one bowl?

231
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:05,200
It was several bowls!

232
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,560
And how many times has it been?

233
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,150
She runs a business too.

234
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:11,040
Well, hasn't she let you run a tab
now and then?

235
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,070
You've got it all wrong.

236
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:13,740
I've never bought a thing from her.

237
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,150
She's a gossiping old hag.

238
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,740
That's why you should
cut her some slack.

239
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:17,790
She often gossips

240
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:19,550
about everyone and everything.

241
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:20,640
Why should I?

242
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,480
Do you even know
how to get along with people?

243
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,400
Do you hear yourself?

244
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,660
She tells stories about you,

245
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,590
and you're no better
with that mouth of yours.

246
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:27,870
How is this my fault?

247
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:29,440
Hasn't she supported
our business before?

248
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,600
Who supported your business?

249
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,160
When did she ever support your business?

250
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,630
How's your appetite lately?

251
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:58,660
Pretty good.

252
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,310
Anything you feel like eating?

253
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,740
Not really.

254
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,790
I don't even know
what's good to eat during exams.

255
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,420
Is there anything good for brainpower

256
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,150
I should buy?

257
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:10,110
Ask your classmates.

258
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,630
The school food is good enough.

259
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:20,460
Oh no, I forgot to grab
the new receipt book.

260
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,590
Wait for me here.

261
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:34,870
(Ms. Ma's General Store)
Qingyu? It's been a while.

262
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,350
Have you not been helping out
at the shop after school lately?

263
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,980
Oh dear, just look at that little face.

264
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,500
It's all gloomy.

265
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:44,980
What are you frowning for

266
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:45,840
at such a young age?

267
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,260
Even the prettiest face
stops looking pretty when you frown.

268
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:49,460
It's none of your business.

269
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:52,240
I'm just worried about you.

270
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,440
You got it wrong that day.

271
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,120
I wasn't coming out
of Ming Sheng's place.

272
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,280
You must've seen wrong.

273
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,900
Your mom already told me.
I was the one who saw wrong.

274
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,260
Anyway,
Ming Sheng doesn't live there anymore.

275
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,980
You two won't
see each other again from now on.

276
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:06,790
Qingyu.

277
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,980
Alright, I'll get back to work.

278
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,030
I'll leave you two to it.

279
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:21,420
By the way, Mom,

280
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:23,630
there's this school research project

281
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:24,740
about wetlands.

282
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,500
I want to go to Qingxi Wetland
this weekend

283
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,080
with Mumu.

284
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,980
She's taking
the college entrance exam is soon,

285
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,630
so it's a good chance to relax a bit.

286
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,500
Sure.

287
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,460
You two can study hard together.

288
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:35,870
Be back early.

289
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:39,940
Sit tight.

290
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:10,830
Here.

291
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,790
Why did you suddenly move?

292
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:23,500
Does your dad know?

293
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:25,500
Yeah.

294
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,260
I'm doing the TEF.

295
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,460
It's a closed training class.

296
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:32,030
They offered dorms,

297
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,150
so I figured
I'd get a change of environment.

298
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:35,870
I wouldn't feel bored at home.

299
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:38,590
My dad's caught up in a medical lawsuit.

300
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,740
He doesn't have time to deal with me.

301
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:48,110
Then why haven't
you been coming to school?

302
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,660
I haven't seen you in ages.

303
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,030
I took a leave.

304
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:53,500
The teacher said
she wanted to ask my dad about it.

305
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:56,630
But I figured
he can't control me anyway.

306
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,830
As long
as I stay out of trouble, it's fine.

307
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,180
What about you? How have you been?

308
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:06,790
It doesn't seem too good.

309
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,420
Alright, stop poking it.

310
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:13,180
It's becoming undrinkable.

311
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:29,630
This is Dr. Le Fan's number
at the provincial hospital.

312
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,870
She's my dad's old classmate,
and she's kind.

313
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:33,220
She's a therapist.

314
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,310
If you ever feel really down,

315
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:36,460
just give her a call.

316
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,260
Thanks.

317
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:55,110
Well, give one to Qiao Qingyu too.

318
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,460
She probably needs it even more.

319
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,500
Jiujiu's been with me for two months.

320
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,070
Since I happened to be out today,

321
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:31,150
I thought I'd set it free.

322
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,790
Isn't this the bird

323
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:36,110
you and Sheng found together?

324
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,350
I saw it at his place before.

325
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:44,180
Sheng moved out all of a sudden.

326
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,070
Yeah, I heard.

327
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:50,420
Yesterday,

328
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,630
I saw him
at the bubble tea shop near school.

329
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:58,310
He looked dispirited.

330
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:03,460
I've known him a long time,
so I get him.

331
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,030
If nothing

332
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:06,900
had happened between you two,

333
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:09,110
he wouldn't be that upset.

334
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:15,030
I'm not blaming you
because I feel bad for him.

335
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:17,220
I'm upset because you didn't tell me

336
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,180
the whole story.

337
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,550
So it bugged me.

338
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,070
Sheng isn't the dramatic type.

339
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:27,070
Did you say something

340
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:29,030
or do something
that made him misunderstand?

341
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,590
Nothing at all.

342
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,500
Ugh, forget it.

343
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:39,310
No point dwelling on it.
It's all in the past now.

344
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,350
Here's Dr. Le Fan's number
at the provincial hospital.

345
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,390
Keep it.

346
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,740
Sheng made sure I gave it to you.

347
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:54,150
I want him to feel rest assured.

348
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:01,700
Let's do it here.

349
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:02,740
Yeah, here's good.

350
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,940
Why isn't Jiujiu flying out?

351
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,790
Is its injury not healed yet?

352
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:26,940
What kind of bird
do you think Jiujiu is?

353
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:32,260
It's still young, so it's hard to tell.

354
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:37,740
I hope it's an eagle.

355
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,260
It's just too weak for now.

356
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:46,500
One day it'll spread its wings
and take flight.

357
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,180
It'll fly free.

358
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:50,630
It'll grow up eventually.

359
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,460
Mumu.

360
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:59,630
I don't want to grow up.

361
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:05,700
Growing up means turning into

362
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,030
the kind of adult we don't like.

363
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,460
Will growing up really
make things better?

364
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:19,460
I have no clue.

365
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,150
Quick, let me take a look.

366
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,070
Will it kill you to let me see?

367
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:43,900
Call me Dad.

368
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:47,500
Dad!
Come on, let me see.

369
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:49,740
Ye Zilin, what are you whispering about?

370
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,150
Say it louder so everyone can hear.

371
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:04,980
Stop shaking.

372
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:18,310
Everyone, get to the field!

373
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:19,220
Quick!

374
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:34,700
Hurry up!

375
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:37,980
Stay safe, everyone!

376
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,870
Table four's noodles are ready.

377
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:17,280
(A 7.8 magnitude earthquake
has struck Xichuan City.)

378
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,550
(According to the State Council's
emergency response plan,)

379
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:22,310
(the national earthquake
emergency mechanism)

380
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:23,980
(has now been activated.)

381
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,420
(Relief personnel)

382
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:28,160
(and supplies
are already being fully mobilized.)

383
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:31,070
(As the saying goes, when disaster strikes,
help comes from all sides.)

384
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:41,900
Help whatever you can.

385
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:44,260
We should help those disaster victims.

386
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,700
Every little bit counts. Do good.

387
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:50,390
Patient. One at a time.

388
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,460
This is all the money we've got.

389
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,070
It's not much help at all.

390
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:07,070
But everyone already donated
everything they could.

391
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,180
Why don't we go fundraise on the street?

392
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,420
The more people, the better.

393
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,460
If more people give, the money adds up.

394
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,040
I heard money's not helpful anymore.

395
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,220
What they really need
in the disaster zone is supplies.

396
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:17,240
That's easy.

397
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,740
We collect donations on the street,

398
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,000
then buy supplies with the money

399
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,120
and deliver them
to the disaster area ourselves.

400
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:22,350
Sure.

401
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,420
Sounds good to me.

402
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,550
What's good about it?

403
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:31,440
I get that you want to help

404
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,740
those in the disaster zone.

405
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:33,980
But you're students.

406
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,460
Your priority is to study.

407
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:37,870
But...

408
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:39,940
Don't we study
so we can serve our country?

409
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:40,630
Exactly.

410
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,560
And now is when our country needs us.

411
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,120
Fine, let me ask you this question.

412
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,260
How much do you think
you can raise on the streets?

413
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,560
Do you even know what supplies

414
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,420
are needed the most?

415
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,350
Transport is cut off at the epicenter.

416
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:52,280
So, how are you planning
to deliver the supplies?

417
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:54,350
Even if you make it
to the disaster area,

418
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,190
do you know how to survive aftershocks?

419
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:58,920
Or are you just going to wait
for someone else to come to your rescue?

420
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,390
Class, what I'm trying to say

421
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:10,590
is our society

422
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,350
is like a precise machine.

423
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:15,180
Only when everyone does their part

424
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:17,590
can that machine run efficiently

425
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,700
and handle sudden emergencies.

426
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,700
One day, when you grow up,

427
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:23,350
you'll naturally become part of it.

428
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:25,630
But for now, all you have to do

429
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:26,980
is study.

430
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:28,590
Got it?

431
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:44,390
Alright.

432
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,740
Turn to page 38.

433
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:47,840
Let's continue

434
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,460
the question we didn't finish yesterday.

435
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:55,030
Actually, I've already
gone over this problem before.

436
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:55,680
But half of you

437
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,980
still got it wrong.

438
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:57,740
Why?

439
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,630
There are two reasons.

440
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:00,660
First, you didn't actually

441
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:01,980
master the answering technique.

442
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:02,840
Second,

443
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,500
you didn't read the question carefully.

444
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,790
Alright, let me show you...

445
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:07,040
I was totally wrong about Sun.

446
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,590
I didn't expect him to be cold-blooded.

447
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,480
He doesn't care at all
about the disaster victims.

448
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,180
Exactly. And he told us

449
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:14,350
what we need to do is study.

450
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,640
He just looks down on us,

451
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,180
and he thinks we're just troublemakers.

452
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:19,590
I don't think that's what Mr. Sun meant.

453
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,350
Stop defending him already.

454
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:24,980
Yeah, we all heard that.

455
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,500
Don't you think

456
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,030
Mr. Sun has no life outside of work?

457
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:31,790
I never heard of him dating anyone.

458
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:33,700
Isn't that what they call a workaholic?

459
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:34,700
Totally.

460
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:37,460
And he's getting old. How scary.

461
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,180
Ready? Go!

462
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:45,830
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

463
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:51,180
2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

464
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:56,460
3, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

465
00:30:56,630 --> 00:31:02,220
4, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

466
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:08,110
5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

467
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:08,940
Alright.

468
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:10,390
That's it for today.

469
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:12,390
This Saturday,
we'll be representing the school

470
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:14,630
at the community's charity performance
for disaster relief.

471
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:15,870
So when you're home,

472
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:18,420
practice the moves a bit more.

473
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:20,740
Especially the coordination
between lead and group dancers.

474
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:22,310
Okay? Thank you all!

475
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:39,500
You obviously love dancing
and have a gift for it.

476
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:42,070
You even helped me
with the choreography.

477
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,980
Why won't you join the dance club?

478
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:49,630
You know Qiao Beiyu
was really good at dancing, right?

479
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,500
Ever since what happened to her,

480
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:57,070
my mom's had this bias against dancing.

481
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,350
She thinks girls who dance

482
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,870
are all flirty and wanton.

483
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,500
After what happened before,

484
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:07,150
she's even more paranoid now,

485
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:08,420
always watching me like a hawk.

486
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:11,550
If she found out that

487
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:13,460
I've been dancing like Beiyu did,

488
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,260
I honestly can't imagine

489
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:16,790
what she might do.

490
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,150
So, are you just going to live

491
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:22,900
your whole life on your mom's terms?

492
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,870
Maybe that's the only way

493
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,260
no one gets hurt.

494
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:50,390
Here comes a layup.

495
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:51,630
Come on. One, two.

496
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:55,830
I'm not even blocking!

497
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:56,940
Fake!

498
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:57,980
Fake block!

499
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:58,420
How fake!

500
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:06,240
You scared me!

501
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,030
What are you doing?

502
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:09,500
It's Sun.
Sun got scolded by the principal.

503
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:10,740
That's really him.

504
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:12,900
It was always him scolding us,

505
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,980
but for once we got to see
someone scold him!

506
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:15,700
Yeah.

507
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,590
Do you think

508
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:18,870
maybe the principal found out

509
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:21,550
that Sun didn't show enough sympathy
for the victims?

510
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,900
So that's why he got scolded?

511
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:23,630
For sure.

512
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:24,030
Right?

513
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:24,830
Certainly.

514
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:27,080
Mr. Sun's usually really kind to us.

515
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,740
You guys shouldn't
be talking bad about him.

516
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:31,900
You just don't get it.

517
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,790
He did us a small favor
by being kind to us.

518
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,590
But ignoring
the suffering of disaster victims

519
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:37,790
is a matter of principle.

520
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:39,440
We can't ignore the big picture

521
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,830
just because of some small favors.

522
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:42,740
Yeah. Exactly.

523
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:45,310
He's not even from Huanzhou, is he?

524
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:47,700
So what?

525
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,310
Don't change the subject, okay?

526
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,310
When I turned in my homework today,

527
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:52,940
I heard the Class 4 homeroom teacher say

528
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:55,110
Mr. Sun's parents
are still in the disaster zone.

529
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:56,550
And he hasn't been able to reach them.

530
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:00,310
Alright. Class is starting.

531
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:01,310
Come on, let's go.

532
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,500
Let's go.

533
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:23,587
(Chemistry Laboratory 5)

534
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,110
Stand up.

535
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:43,470
Good morning, sir.

536
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:50,860
Please sit down.

537
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:58,990
Who's on duty today?

538
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:00,110
The podium's so tidy.

539
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:15,510
Well, why are you so quiet today?

540
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,070
Did you get into trouble again?

541
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:26,480
Are you trying to redeem yourselves?
Tell me, class monitor.

542
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:29,700
Mr. Sun.

543
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:30,910
Yes?

544
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:36,910
From now on,
we'll really pay attention in your class.

545
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,180
And from now on, no one's allowed

546
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:42,220
to joke about you again.

547
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,260
That's all I wanted to say.

548
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:49,110
That's nothing wrong
being a bachelor, Mr. Sun.

549
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:05,910
Alright, turn to...

550
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:08,700
Page 90.

551
00:36:10,812 --> 00:36:15,875
(Sea Water)

552
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:41,470
Pass it over...

553
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:42,110
Here, take it!

554
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:49,660
Nice shot!

555
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:51,070
Was that in?

556
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:51,860
You still playing?

557
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:52,300
We're out.

558
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,340
Bye!

559
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,740
Water? Hao?

560
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,070
Yeah...

561
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:01,340
Sheng.

562
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,260
That medical dispute your dad's in

563
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:12,300
is all over the Internet now.

564
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:13,820
Yeah, I heard too.

565
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:15,780
They call Dr. Ming a heartless doctor

566
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:19,030
who overtreated the patient for profit
and caused their death.

567
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:20,430
It's gone viral.

568
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:22,340
Well,

569
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,470
we know it's total nonsense.

570
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:26,300
We have faith in your dad's character.

571
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:29,860
What he did has nothing to do with me.

572
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:30,700
There, there.

573
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:31,380
Drop it.

574
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:32,820
Speak of the devil.

575
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:34,990
Uncle Qiuxin.

576
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,740
Sheng, we're heading off first.

577
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:39,990
Bye, Uncle Qiuxin.

578
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:40,740
Bye.

579
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,220
Why haven't you come home?

580
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,700
You're not answering my calls either.

581
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:52,150
Didn't Sun call you?

582
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:54,070
I signed up
for an intensive French course.

583
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:55,780
It runs until the exam.

584
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:56,920
I'm staying there.

585
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,600
Shouldn't you have called me personally

586
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,660
to tell me that yourself?

587
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,470
Didn't you think I'd be worried?

588
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:03,260
But did you tell me about your stuff?

589
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:07,950
Oh.

590
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:12,180
If you're talking about
the medical dispute,

591
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:14,470
that did happen all of a sudden.

592
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:17,180
I just haven't had the chance
to tell you about it.

593
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,220
Apart from that,

594
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,660
why didn't you tell me

595
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:24,960
it wasn't you who drove my mom away?

596
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,030
I...

597
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:32,260
Sheng.

598
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:34,820
There are things

599
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:37,740
you're really better off not knowing.

600
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:40,030
You played me like a fool.

601
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:43,550
I hated the wrong person like an idiot.

602
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,260
Are you proud of yourself?

603
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,300
It'd just take a few words,

604
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,550
but why couldn't you say them?

605
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,860
Do you enjoy torturing yourself?

606
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,180
From now on,

607
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:00,180
if you won't tell me anything,

608
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,430
don't try to control me, then.

609
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,340
Just take good care of yourself.

610
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,220
What are you doing?

611
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:35,030
Qingyu.

612
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:36,630
Have you seen my MP3 player?

613
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:38,720
I told you to keep your stuff away.

614
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,380
Every time you need it,
you can't find it.

615
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:42,700
Is it here?

616
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:56,850
(China Post,
Huanzhou People's Hospital, Qiao Qingyu)

617
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:59,470
Why was my delivery with you?

618
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:02,070
Oh, I remember now.

619
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:03,340
You weren't home that day,

620
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:05,150
so I accepted it for you.

621
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:06,700
Then

622
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:09,590
I totally forgot to give it to you.

623
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,962
(Huanzhou People's Hospital
Medical Record, Qiao Beiyu)

624
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,990
This is Qiao Beiyu's medical record.

625
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,760
(Dermatology &amp; STDs Department,
Initial Condition Assessment)

626
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:35,212
(Blood test levels are normal.
Condition is under control and stable.)

627
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,919
(CD4+ T-cell levels
have returned to normal range.)

628
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,560
(Condition is stable. Continue medication.)

629
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:42,705
Beiyu passed away
on Lunar New Year's Eve last year.

630
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:46,180
But according to this record,

631
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:49,340
in December of the year before,

632
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:52,300
her test results were all still stable.

633
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:57,030
From stable condition to her death,

634
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:59,110
it was barely two months.

635
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:00,300
Isn't that way too fast?

636
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:03,180
Do you think Beiyu's death

637
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:04,990
wasn't inevitable,

638
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,470
