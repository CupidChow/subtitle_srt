Change your life with hard work.

Achieve your dreams with perseverance.

19
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,280
Students,

20
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,020
the NCEE is not the finish line.

21
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,990
It's the starting point of your journey
into adulthood.

22
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:02,710
So this coming year is of the essence.

23
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,100
I hope all of you will work hard,

24
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,710
harder, and even harder.

25
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,640
Only by giving it your all
can you live up to your youth.

26
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:13,480
We will give it our all
and live up to our youth!

27
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,360
Good.

28
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:16,800
Open your textbooks.

29
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,330
Let us begin
our first class of senior year.

30
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,480
Before we start,

31
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,610
I will go over our plan
for this final school year.

32
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,060
Qingyu, for today's test,

33
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,360
what did you choose
for the last multiple-choice question?

34
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,010
I picked A and C.

35
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,800
I don't even remember what I chose.

36
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:36,900
Did you finish the last major question

37
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,290
in the comprehensive science section?

38
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:39,330
I did.

39
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:40,640
Can you explain it to me later?

40
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:40,830
Sure.

41
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,340
I couldn't figure it out no matter what.

42
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:42,730
All right.

43
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:45,480
Can we stop talking about the test
during our break?

44
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,450
Give it a rest.

45
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:47,410
Qingyu, just ignore her.

46
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,460
Exactly.
Ever heard of work-life balance?

47
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,730
When it's time to rest, you rest.

48
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:51,570
Qiao Qingyu!

49
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:53,570
Mr. Sun wants you to go to his office.

50
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,680
Mr. Sun.

51
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,760
Qingyu.

52
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,680
You wanted to see me?

53
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:03,480
Yes.

54
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,960
Your father called.

55
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:09,130
Dad?

56
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:10,170
Qing.

57
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,330
Um...

58
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:13,330
I'm on my way back

59
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,240
to Nanqiao Village now.

60
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:16,960
Your grandfather passed away.

61
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:19,800
Are you listening, Qing?

62
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,640
Yes.

63
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,570
I left the key to the drawer at home

64
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:24,460
with Qiao Huan.

65
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,940
When you get back, grab the passbook,

66
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,960
then come back to Nanqiao Village
with Yu tonight.

67
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:09,800
=Episode 20=
(Li Fanghao's Outburst)

68
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:25,800
On the day of Qiao Beiyu's funeral,

69
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,320
Mom and Dad made sure to let
Grandpa and Grandma know ahead of time.

70
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:35,410
I remember
it was Chinese New Year's Eve.

71
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:36,970
We left before sunrise

72
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:39,290
for Shunyun Funeral Parlor.

73
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,920
We waited and waited. No one came.

74
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,210
You have to book the farewell hall

75
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:48,240
ahead of time.

76
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:52,210
We missed our scheduled slot

77
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,770
because we were waiting for them,

78
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:59,290
so Qiao Beiyu didn't even get
a proper memorial service.

79
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,210
She was sent straight for cremation.

80
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:07,320
Do you think that night

81
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,320
our grandparents, Uncle Haisheng,
and Uncle Jiangsheng

82
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:12,480
were just having their reunion dinner,

83
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:15,170
like every other year?

84
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,050
Maybe it was for the best.

85
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,880
Spared her from more scolding,
even at the end.

86
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,240
Six.

87
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:50,240
Aw, shucks. Draw a tile.

88
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,360
Here I come.

89
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:52,800
Wow!

90
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:53,620
Listen.

91
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,860
With the way I'm playing today,

92
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,060
I am definitely winning money.

93
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,850
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

94
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,410
Yeah, you never know.

95
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:01,050
I don't believe

96
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:03,560
you can beat me today, Yanfen.

97
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,240
Let's see who has better luck.

98
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,530
Luck is different for everyone.

99
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:07,620
When I left the house,

100
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,290
a little bird chirped
right above my head.

101
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:21,537
(Libation)

102
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:27,050
Yu. Qing.

103
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:27,680
Come on. Hurry!

104
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,650
I'll take that.

105
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,970
Go offer incense
and bow to your grandfather.

106
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:31,680
Go on.

107
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,800
Go.

108
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:35,680
Dad.

109
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,480
You're here.

110
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:50,090
Go on.

111
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:51,680
Here.

112
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,800
Yu,

113
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:18,170
you're the eldest grandson
of the Qiao family now.

114
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,730
That comes with serious responsibility.

115
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,460
Tonight through tomorrow morning,

116
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,850
you'll stay here all night
to keep vigil for your grandfather.

117
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:25,660
Tomorrow morning
at the funeral procession,

118
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,580
you'll follow Haisheng

119
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,120
and carry your grandfather's portrait.

120
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:28,920
Do you hear me?

121
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:29,770
Mm.

122
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:31,460
Remember.

123
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,210
One of Characters!

124
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:36,970
Self-draw!

125
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:39,210
Wow! You're in luck tonight.

126
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:43,120
Right? Did you see that?

127
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,050
Come on.

128
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,050
Here you go.

129
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:52,100
South Wind.

130
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,320
The wind direction has changed.

131
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,090
Fine.

132
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,210
Here, here.

133
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,290
Drink!

134
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,090
Drink up!

135
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:19,880
Here.

136
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,650
Thanks.

137
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:23,920
Fanghao,

138
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:25,440
pour us some hot water.

139
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,920
We're hungry. Make us some noodles.

140
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,840
I need to check on Mom,

141
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,960
then I'll cook for you all.

142
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:34,660
Fanghao,

143
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,530
your family has run a noodle shop
for many years.

144
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:38,680
I've always wanted to try your cooking.

145
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,200
Order whatever you like.

146
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,800
I can't possibly.
That's too much trouble.

147
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,300
Plenty of liquor to go around tonight.

148
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,680
Whether happy or sad,
a gathering should be lively.

149
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,250
Fanghao!

150
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:51,410
Coming!

151
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:52,920
Fanghao!

152
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:54,490
Coming, Mom!

153
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:56,010
Fanghao!

154
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:57,010
That's too much trouble.

155
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,600
Tch. Look at her face.
Acting all reluctant

156
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,960
like someone owes her something.

157
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:06,650
Yanfen, Jinrui's grandfather
had been sick for quite some time.

158
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:08,260
She's been handling everything
on her own.

159
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,650
It must be tough on her.

160
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:10,770
No one made her do it.

161
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:11,300
She chose to.

162
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,580
I mean, every family's got
an elderly person to look after.

163
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,600
It is exhausting, though.

164
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,650
Enough talking.
Let's get back to our game.

165
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:17,560
Whose turn is it?

166
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,130
It's my turn.

167
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,770
Mom.

168
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:33,440
You're still up?

169
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,130
They're too loud. I can't sleep.

170
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:39,770
Weren't you supposed

171
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:41,410
to be here to look after Grandma?

172
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:43,560
How come
you're serving the whole family?

173
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,370
One person or more

174
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:47,770
barely makes a difference.

175
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,290
It's not a big deal.

176
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,080
They treat you like that

177
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,250
and you're not even upset?

178
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,010
I've realized a long time ago

179
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,130
that life's just about getting through

180
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,720
the hard stuff.

181
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,050
You can't run from it.
You just have to endure.

182
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:07,250
The moment you close your eyes for good,

183
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,130
that's when the pain ends.

184
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:13,960
Your sister's at peace now.

185
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,170
And so is your grandfather.

186
00:10:33,325 --> 00:10:36,875
(Uphold Loyalty, Filial Piety, Integrity,
Benevolence, Propriety, Wisdom)

187
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,890
How's Mom?

188
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,960
She just fell asleep.

189
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,800
She barely eats anything.

190
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:54,720
They say old people need company.

191
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,010
Dad is gone, and Mom is all alone.

192
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:59,890
How is she supposed to go on?

193
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,600
Fanghao,

194
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,080
take a break.

195
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,800
I'm fine.

196
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,290
We've been relying on you lately.

197
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:20,890
Haisheng, if you have something to say,
just say it.

198
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,840
Since everyone's here,
I just want to take this chance

199
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:30,200
to discuss how we're going to care
for Mom moving forward.

200
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,800
Dad has passed.

201
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,770
Mom's been bedridden from the shock.

202
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:37,130
What are we going to do?

203
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:39,840
Oh.

204
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,200
Here, Haisheng.

205
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,080
Here're six months' living expenses
for her.

206
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:50,130
It's not about the money.

207
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,650
The thing is,

208
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:54,560
Fanghao has been the one
taking care of Mom.

209
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,170
We're worried Mom won't adjust well
if someone else steps in.

210
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,200
All right.
Qingyu will take the NCEE next year.

211
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:04,060
After that, I'll come back
and take over caring for her.

212
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,410
Since you guys don't have the time,

213
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:08,170
we'll handle it for now.

214
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:10,720
Make sure you send us the money on time.

215
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:14,290
It's us who'll be looking after her
until the very end.

216
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,170
And about this house.

217
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,650
Dad said while he was alive

218
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,530
that it should go to Jinrui.

219
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,170
You all have no objections, right?

220
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,010
No objections.

221
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:29,440
All right.

222
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,560
There's one more thing.

223
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:34,780
People are saying
the misfortunes in our family lately

224
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,840
are because there's a problem
with the ancestral tomb.

225
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:40,290
What problem?

226
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:42,960
It's Qiao Beiyu, of course.

227
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,490
Everyone is in consensus

228
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,560
that we pick a date

229
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,440
and move Bei's ashes

230
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,410
out of the ancestral grave.

231
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:02,920
And where do you expect her

232
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,250
to go after that?

233
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:08,170
Well, it can't be helped.
It's not our fault.

234
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,580
She chose to go the way she did.

235
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,780
She should never have been buried
in the ancestral tomb to begin with.

236
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,620
Should've been scattered
in some lake or river...

237
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,290
Chen Yanfen!

238
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,490
Go on, finish what you were saying.

239
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:18,620
What? What did I say wrong?

240
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:19,200
She was a jinx!

241
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,140
Say that one more time.

242
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,180
She's dead and she still...

243
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,460
What do you think you're doing?

244
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,080
Stop it!

245
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:24,600
Mom!

246
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:25,560
What are you doing?

247
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,530
What's wrong with you?

248
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:28,020
Lusheng! Do something about your wife!

249
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:29,200
You've lost your mind!

250
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:42,920
Get over here!

251
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,130
Stop fighting!

252
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,290
Mom! Mom...

253
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,140
Mom,
Qiao Beiyu never liked Nanqiao Village!

254
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,370
Forget about the family genealogy
and the ancestral tomb!

255
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:52,180
We don't want either!

256
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,530
Let's just take Beiyu and leave.

257
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:09,890
Fine.

258
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,890
We'll move her grave.

259
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,633
(To: Li Fanghao, Qiao Lusheng.)

260
00:17:00,634 --> 00:17:03,620
(From: Qiao Beiyu, No. 12, East District 3,
Nanqiao Village, Shunyun County.)

261

(Mom, Dad,)

262
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:09,690
(I know you've been working very hard)

263
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:11,450
(for this family.)

264
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,010
(When I grow up,)

265
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:14,290
(I'll get a good job)

266
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:16,730
(and give you a good life.)

267
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:19,210
(I don't want
to see you struggle anymore.)

268
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,690
(I miss you.)

269
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:37,100
(To: Li Fanghao, Qiao Lusheng.)

270
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:40,060
(The Qiao's Handmade Noodle House,
No. 23, Chenxin Avenue, Shunyun County.)

271
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:46,460
(From: Qiao Beiyu, No. 12, East District 3,
Nanqiao Village, Shunyun County.)

272
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,800
(To our precious daughter Beiyu,
happy birthday.)

273
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,800
(Some say if life could be traded,)

274
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,450
(Heaven would be filled with parents.)

275
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:14,210
(Our parents have always protected us
in their own way.)

276
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,320
(Clumsily, stubbornly,)

277
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:18,640
(and with everything they have.)

278
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,360
(Their love is silent and heavy,)

279
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:25,250
(sometimes so much
that it suffocates us.)

280
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,290
(But it is also
that love that gives us courage)

281
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:33,250
(Tomb of Our Beloved Daughter, Qiao Beiyu)
(to get through the growing pains, again and again.)

282
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,100
(There was a time)

283
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,660
(I couldn't wait to leave this family.)

284
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:39,640
(Now, I no longer feel that way.)

285
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:01,120
It faces east,
with the mountains at its back.

286
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:03,640
Fresh air and a beautiful view.

287
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,690
Qiao Beiyu will definitely like it here.

288
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:12,320
To all the grandmas and grandpas,

289
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,970
uncles and aunties,
brothers and sisters,

290
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,930
my sister just moved in.

291
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,770
From now on, she'll be your neighbor.

292
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,730
Please take care of her.

293
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,290
Please.

294
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:24,010
Give us a hand.

295
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:24,640
And...

296
00:19:41,725 --> 00:19:46,062
(Tomb of Our Beloved Daughter, Qiao Beiyu)

297
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,050
Beiyu,

298
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,210
isn't it nice here?

299
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,770
Your dad and I have thought it through.

300
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,080
Your little brother and sister
were right.

301
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:10,930
Wherever we are,
that's where our home is.

302
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:16,450
This place is close to Huanzhou.

303
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,800
We'll come

304
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,560
and visit you often.

305
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:28,580
(Tomb of Our Beloved Daughter,
Qiao Beiyu)

306
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:30,490
Beiyu, if you're missing anything,

307
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:31,840
just come to us in a dream.

308
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:36,640
Actually, never mind.
I'm too much of a coward.

309
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,290
Don't come into my dreams.

310
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:39,600
Go find Qingyu instead.

311
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:48,290
Lately,

312
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:51,490
I've been thinking a lot
about when we were kids.

313
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:54,400
I wish we could go back

314
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,730
and see Qiao Beiyu from those days

315
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:01,930
just one more time.

316
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:03,840
Qiao Beiyu.

317
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,010
Qiao Beiyu!

318
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:23,400
That day you ran
from Nanqiao Village to Shunyun,

319
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,770
you were dressed so lightly.

320
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,560
Were you cold?

321
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:31,930
Jinrui let you down,

322
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,840
Uncle Haisheng and Aunt Yanfen
wronged you.

323
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:36,690
You must've felt so angry.

324
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,640
You knew you were sick.

325
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,010
You were alone in that hospital.

326
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,930
You must've been so afraid.

327
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:53,970
I'm sorry, Qiao Beiyu.

328
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:57,560
I wish I could've been there for you.

329
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,560
I miss you, Beiyu.

00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:10,050
There's one thing that really struck me.

553
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,810
He told me

554
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:15,600
that I've always been chasing success.

555
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,200
But success is just

556
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,720
the natural result of your talent

557
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,260
combined with hard work.

558
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,680
That I don't need to chase after it.

559
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,080
More important than success

560
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:27,330
is whether I'm happy

561
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:29,330
and healthy.

562
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:30,600
I think

563
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,240
his way of life and values

564
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,600
have subtly influenced me too.

565
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:36,810
He's the kind of person

566
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:39,280
who never gets anxious or loses sleep.

567
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,560
Unlike me.

568
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:43,640
I'm a perfectionist

569
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:46,330
and I'm terrified of making mistakes.

570
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,330
In personality

571
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:53,330
and even spiritually,

572
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,810
he complements me.

573
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,490
But I still have my reservations.

574
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,010
You know

575
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,930
I've never been able
to get past that hurdle.

576
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:15,450
Mom,

577
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:17,200
I may not

578
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:20,050
have much advice for you,

579
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:24,160
but I can give you my blessing.

580
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,720
That was a bit surprising.

581
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:37,970
Thank you.

582
00:37:40,512 --> 00:37:45,437
(Lounge, Ballet)

583
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:46,380
I am so tired.

584
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:47,760
Let's head back and turn in early.

585
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,410
Yeah.

586
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,490
Anyone still inside?

587
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:52,530
Doesn't look like it.

588
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:53,490
Thanks.

589
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:08,850
The food was quite nice.

590
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,640
Didn't expect you
to put away that many crayfish.

591
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:13,640
Ms. Anna.

592
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,300
This is your pass.

593
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:15,680
Thank you.

594
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,340
The competition is set
for 8 AM tomorrow.

595
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:17,780
Okay.

596
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:19,490
Sir, we still haven't managed
to reach her.

597
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:20,640
What's going on?

598
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:21,700
We have a problem.

599
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,660
The hotel informed us
that the rooms were overbooked.

600
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,940
One contestant from the amateur group
still hasn't checked in

601
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,130
and left no contact information,

602
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:28,370
so we can't hold a room for her.

603
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,370
Oh.

604
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:30,760
Who is it?

605
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,120
Qiao Qingyu.

606
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:37,330
When I came into the hotel
this afternoon,

607
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:38,720
I saw a few girls heading straight

608
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,050
to the rehearsal hall.

609
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:41,300
She might be there.

610
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,850
You can try looking for her there.

611
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:46,240
