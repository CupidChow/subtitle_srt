00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,080
(Adapted from the serialized work "Reborn"
by Qiang Yu)

15
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,480
What... What AIDS? Who told you that?

16
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,840
Nonsense! These are simply rumors!

17
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:40,960
If it's nonsense,

18
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,230
why didn't you argue with them?

19
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,560
How?

20
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,280
How am I supposed to talk back

21
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,670
to that many people?

22
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:48,790
You kid is so ignorant.

23
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:50,200
Words can kill, you know?

24
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,520
But if we don't make it clear,
we keep getting bullied

25
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,440
and get dragged down by it
no matter where we go.

26
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,200
Who's bullying you?

27
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,390
We've already moved to a new place.
She's gone.

28
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:58,480
Everything's over.

29
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,280
No, it's not over.

30
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,310
What do you want, then?

31
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,000
I want the truth cleared up.

32
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:05,390
It's the only way to silence them.

33
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,200
If we keep hiding,

34
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,600
it'll only get worse.

35
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,360
Clear what up?

36
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,320
Don't act all smart just

37
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,990
because you're a little educated.

38
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:16,200
I'm talking about your studies.

39
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,800
Why are you talking
about something else?

40
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,600
Can't you focus on
your practice exams instead?

41
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,110
Give me a break,

42
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,640
and let me have some peace.

43
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,600
Didn't we agree

44
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,040
to leave the past behind
once we moved to Huanzhou?

45
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,200
The past still affects her,

46
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,950
and she's not a young child anymore.

47
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,230
When you talk to her,

48
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:41,110
you need to do it the right way.

49
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,550
I don't want to talk to you.

50
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,854
Okay, a drink as punishment.

(Words Can Kill)

52
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,990
Nice handwriting.

53
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,760
It has my style.

54
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,320
This is the first

55
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,040
and last time I finish
your homework for you.

56
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,790
Usually, people beg to do it for me.

57
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:22,360
But I just hate their ugly handwriting.

58
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,680
I have no obligation to help you.

59
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,710
Excuse me.
It's not an obligation but compensation.

60
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,550
Were you talking
with Ming Sheng just now?

61
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:51,270
Did you know him before?

62
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:53,880
I heard him call you Beiyu's younger sister.

63
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,360
You have an older sister?

64
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,710
No, I'm the eldest,
and I have a younger brother.

65
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,670
Are you two close or something?

66
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:07,760
I only want to remind you

67
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,760
to be careful.

68
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,080
Be careful of what?

69
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,830
Of some girls in our class.

70
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,360
Speaking of Ming Sheng,

71
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,440
there's not a single student in Huanzhou

72
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,950
who doesn't know him.

73
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,350
He's good-looking, loyal,

74
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:21,950
and the pride of our school.

75
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:23,200
Sheng,

76
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:25,830
how about we play after school?

77
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,150
Sure.

78
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,710
Let's call over those from Class 4 too.

79
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,590
I can't make it today.

80
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:31,350
I have training.

81
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,800
Well, my homework's done.

82
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,920
I'll just wake up early tomorrow
to finish it.

83
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,470
Then I'm done.

84
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:40,880
He's impulsive, playful,
and full of himself.

85
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,150
A flood of chaos is more like it.

86
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,680
Ming Sheng always skips class
and hands in homework late.

87
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,800
But he's naturally gifted.

88
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,000
Before this,

89
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,150
he even won 1st place
in the national biology competition.

90
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,560
He may mess around all the time.

91
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,390
But his grades are good.

92
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:59,200
He's not studious

93
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,000
but excels in everything.

94
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,080
It's no wonder he's popular in school.

95
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,680
I have to go now.

96
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,030
Bye, guys.

97
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,680
They're playing basketball.

98
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,950
Come and watch for a bit.

99
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,910
There's something I never understood.

100
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,950
We were only standing up
for what was right.

101
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,390
But that snack shop owner insisted

102
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,880
Sheng broke her chair

103
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,120
and reported him to school.

104
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,640
You can just explain it to Mr. Sun.

105
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,560
No point.

106
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:13,000

00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,320
No way.

189
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,750
He didn't hit me.

190
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,350
But he's targeting me on purpose.

191
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:10,040
You and Ming Sheng have no grudge.

192
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,350
So, why would he target you?

193
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,560
It's because of her.

194
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:14,160
We all moved to Huanzhou.

195
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,630
But she's causing trouble everywhere.

196
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:19,320
Her?

197
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,320
Qiao Beiyu?

198
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,560
Qiao Beiyu

199
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,800
was popular in Shunyun.

200
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,800
Even when we went out,

201
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,280
people only recognized us

202
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,200
as her little siblings.

203
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,110
She was like the sun,

204
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,950
and we were the moon.

205
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:44,080
We needed her bright light
simply to exist.

206
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,800
What's the use of being pretty?

207
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,920
The prettier you are,
the more trouble you cause.

208
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:53,160
Sometimes, I think

209
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,040
you're a little jealous of her.

210
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,680
I hate her.

211
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,750
Your sister is talented and beautiful.

212
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:10,800
The photos

213
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,920
will definitely look great.

214
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:20,400
If you don't want to do it,
you can go home.

215
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,230
You didn't have to come.

216
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,710
It's not like I wanted to come.

217
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,680
Mom was worried about you being alone.

218
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:51,950
You like them?

219
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,320
You have that superstar vibe.

220
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:57,830
Come on.

221
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,400
Tuck your chin in a little more.

222
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,680
Raise your right hand a bit higher.

223
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,830
Smile a bit more.

224
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,160
Good, good. This one's perfect.

225
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:09,230
Let's take a few more shots.

226
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,230
Little miss, did you take the earrings?

227
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,400
What earrings?

228
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,750
The ones in the jewelry box.

229
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,200
The ones you tried on earlier.

230
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,630
Now they're missing.

231
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:23,160
Why don't you search for them?

232
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,040
I didn't take them.

233
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,160
But no one else is in the shop.

234
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,470
What's the matter?

235
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:31,750
Beiyu, I didn't take the earrings.

236
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,470
I just tried them on,

237
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:35,080
then put them back.

238
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:36,110
I...

239
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:37,630
I didn't take them.

240
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,080
How about we just forget it?

241
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,440
They're not expensive anyway.

242
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,590
Qiao Qingyu,

243
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:43,830
put them back if you took them.

244
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,040
I really didn't take them.

245
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,470
If you don't believe me,
check yourselves.

246
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,710
Baby!

247
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:19,950
Baby!

248
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,200
You're finally out.

249
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,240
Come here, give me a hug.

250
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,800
I bought you these flowers.

251
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,160
Do you like them?

252
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,040
Thanks.

253
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:30,800
You're welcome.

254
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,870
You must be tired
after a long day at school.

255
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,400
It was okay.

256
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,520
Let's go. I'm a bit hungry.

257
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,400
Great, we're having seafood.

258
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:39,680
Qiao Beiyu!

259
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,320
I'm in Huanzhou
for the math competition.

260
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,990
Mom told me to bring you these fruits.

261
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,520
Who are you? I don't know you.

262
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,200
Are you the younger sister
from back home?

263
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:57,920
I just said I don't know her.

264
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,590
Let's go.

265
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,870
She does look a bit like you.

266
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:08,950
Qiao Beiyu,
I'll never acknowledge you after this!

267
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:16,280
Thinking about it now,

268
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,590
she was a little pitiful too.

269
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:21,870
She grew up back in Nanqiao Village.

270
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,480
But Mom and Dad barely cared about her.

271
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,710
She even died so young.

272
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,230
She's dead now.

273
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:31,200
So she can't hear
all those terrible things now.

274
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:31,920
But what about us?

275
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,600
Why are we the ones paying
for her mistakes?

276
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,350
We're the pitiful ones.

277
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,830
She caused trouble while she was alive.

278
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:39,800
Even after her death,
she's still dragging us down.

279
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:40,830
Look at Mom.

280
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:42,710
She's scared of health class textbooks.

281
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,560
I get laughed at and bullied every day.

282
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,990
If I could choose,

283
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,680
I'd rather never have had a sister.

284
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:03,990
What's your problem?

285
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,520
Qiao Qingyu, do you really think

286
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,680
I won't do anything to you?

287
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,870
You're spreading lies.

288
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:13,750
Qiao Beiyu died from appendicitis.

289
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:14,990
Not what you said.

290
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:16,680
Where's your proof?

291
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,990
You don't have proof either.

292
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:20,200
You can't just make things up.

293
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,320
I have proof.

294
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:24,920
Your sister was treated

295
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,710
at People's Hospital before she passed.

296
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,560
The director of the People's Hospital
is my dad.

297
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:35,110
If you have no proof,
stop saying nonsense.

298
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,920
Let's go to the dance room
and get our practice uniforms.

299
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,440
Sounds good.

300
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,390
What are you looking at?

301
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:14,240
Look at Mumu and
those girls from our class.

302
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:16,720
Are we playing or not?

303
00:17:25,943 --> 00:17:27,190
(I have the evidence.)

304
00:17:27,804 --> 00:17:29,150
(Your sister was treated)

305
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:31,190
(at People's Hospital
before she passed.)

306
00:17:31,511 --> 00:17:34,320
(The director of the People's Hospital
is my dad.)

307
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,670
You guys go ahead.

308
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:40,560
Jiang Nian,

309
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,720
can I borrow your phone?

310
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:43,830
Here.

311
00:17:47,019 --> 00:17:49,040
(Search People's Hospital's director)

312
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,680
(Ming Qiuxin, People's Hospital Director)

313
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,600
(Born in 1961, Huanzhou.
Postdoctoral in medicine.)

314
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,480
(Chief cardiac surgeon and professor.
The Huanzhou People's Hospital Director)

315
00:17:59,914 --> 00:18:00,960
It was appendicitis.

316
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,040
How many times do I have to tell you?

317
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,520
There were complications!

318
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,080
Hey,

319
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:19,480
you're back?

320
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,320
Jinrui?

321
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,590
Qingyu, you're back from school.

322
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,830
Let me introduce.

323
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:27,320
This is your future sister-in-law,
Xiaoyun.

324
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,240
Hi, I'm Nie Xiaoyun.

325
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,430
This is my cousin, Qiao Qingyu.

326
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,560
Nice to meet you, Xiaoyun.

327
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,440
Nice to meet you too.

328
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,870
Please, take a seat.

329
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:35,670
You too.

330
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:36,430
Xiaoyun,

331
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:37,720
has anyone ever told you

332
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,590
that you look like a movie star?

333
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,150
No, not at all.

334
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,280
Fanghao.

335
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,960
Go cut up some fruit.

336
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:47,000
It's okay, don't be so courteous.

337
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,150
Congratulations, Jinrui.

338
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,350
Thank you.

339
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,870
You're really capable

340
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,280
and found yourself such a great girl.

341
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:55,560
You're too kind.

342
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,430
The wedding date is set.

343
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,040
Grandpa and Dad said

344
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,000
we must come in person

345
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,960
to invite your whole family.

346
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,080
That's very thoughtful.

347
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,830
When's the big day?

348
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,760
We're planning
for the next Spring Festival.

349
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,320
The wedding will be in Nanqiao Village.

350
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,910
All the neighbors there

351
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:16,390
watched me grow up.

352
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,040
Since I'm getting married,

353
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,150
I want to share the joy with them.

354
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:22,110
You're the eldest grandson.

355
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:25,040
So it's the tradition
to hold the wedding back home.

356
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,040
That's right.

357
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:26,830
Jinrui,

358
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,040
how did you win over

359
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,960
such a beautiful fiancée?

360
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,150
I heard you're the head
of your office now.

361
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:33,960
Not really.

362
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,400
I was just promoted to the level
of assistant director officer.

363
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,960
You can say it's a deputy division head.

364
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,830
That's still a department head!

365
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,440
Xiaoyun, you probably
don't know this yet.

366
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,560
Jinrui was the first person
from Nanqiao Village

367
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,870
to get into a 211 university

368
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,190
and the first to become

369
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:49,110
a department head
at a state-owned company.

370
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,480
In our family, from our grandparents

371
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,240
to our second uncle and to my dad,

372
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,760
everyone dotes on Jinrui.

373
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,110
We're all so jealous of him.

374
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,960
Then why don't you learn from him?

375
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,830
Same family, but you didn't inherit
any of the good genes.

376
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:06,870
Xiaoyun, you'd better keep
a close eye on Jinrui.

377
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:09,000
Many people lined up
to set him up with someone

378
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,720
and that line went all the way
from our house to the village entrance.

379
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,830
Please make some sense of your joke.

380
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:15,760
It's fine.

381
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,110
I still remember Qing and Yu
from when we used to catch fish

382
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,670
in the stream by the village entrance.

383
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:21,240
We were all just kids back then.

384
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,110
I've been so busy with work
these past few years.

385
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,920
I haven't really been back
to Nanqiao Village.

386
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,280
It's probably been years

387
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,830
since I saw Qing or Yu,

388
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:29,000
especially Yu.

389
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:31,240
He's really grown up.

390
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:33,390
Yeah.

391
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:35,800
I went back to the village
with Jinrui last month.

392
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,000
His mom showed us tons of old photos.

393
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,080
I even took some pictures of them.

394
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,320
Look.

395
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:46,000
See this?

396
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,830
This little kid
in the open-crotch pants is Yu.

397
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,280
That's me?

398
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,760
You look awful.

399
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,430
Who's this? She's really pretty.

400
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:00,760
That's Qiao Beiyu.

401
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:03,960
Beiyu was...

402
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,870
She was a distant relative's daughter.

403
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:06,960
I see.

404
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:11,190
Fanghao,

405
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:13,190
is the fruit...

406
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,800
Go and check on your mom.

407
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:26,910
She got sick

408
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,910
and passed away last year.

409
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,390
I'm so sorry.

410
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,390
I didn't know.

411
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,240
I didn't mean to bring it up.

412
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,390
- It's all right.
- It's okay.

413
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:40,040
The wedding's coming up.

414
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,190
How's the preparation of your house?

415
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:43,280
Both families chipped in

416
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,960
for the down payment
on a small two-bedroom.

417
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:47,630
The place was already nicely furnished.

418
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:49,560
So we'll just tidy it up a bit.

419
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,960
This allows us to skip renovation
and avoid formaldehyde.

420
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:53,670
That's smart.

421
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,040
Come, have some fruit.

422
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:58,190
Here.

423
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,280
Qingyu,

424
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,520
put this on.

425
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:14,670
Thanks.

426
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,910
So this is your little secret hideaway?

427
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:20,720
The view is definitely different.

428
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:25,160
Even just having
a small rooftop like this

429
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,280
to breathe feels like a gift.

430
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,520
So, how's school?

431
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,110
It must be very competitive, right?

432
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,960
Yeah, the students here all
do really well.

433
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:34,520
Don't stress too much.

434
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,800
Good grades are important.

435
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:39,630
But once you're out in society,

436
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:41,430
you'll realize a perfect score on a test

437
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:43,000
doesn't mean that much.

438
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:46,350
What do you mean?

439
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,430
Life is long.

440
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:52,560
There's so much you can't learn
from a textbook.

441
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:54,000
So, how do I learn it?

442
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:55,800
Your experiences will teach you.

443
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:59,280
The world will eventually teach you
how to grow up.

444
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,800
No need.

445
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,960
No need to be polite.

446
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,630
As your older cousin,

447
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:15,480
it's only right I give you a red packet.

448
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,760
You're a young lady now,
and you'll like dressing up.

449
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,240
It all costs money.

450
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,350
I know Aunt Fanghao
is very strict with you.

451
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:24,720
So this money is our little secret.

452
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,000
Don't tell Aunt Fanghao.

453
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:27,910
Okay.

454
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:29,150
When I start working,

455
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,560
I'll give your son a red packet too.

456
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:32,720
I'll charge you interest.

457
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,870
It's windy out here.
Don't stay too long.

458
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,320
I'll head down first.

459
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,150
Jinrui.

460
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:39,670
Yeah?

461
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:43,430
I want to ask you something.

462
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:44,150
What is it?

463
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:49,240
How did Beiyu die?

464
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:53,870
Jinyu.

465
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:54,670
Yes?

466
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:58,800
Do you believe
that Qiao Beiyu died from appendicitis?

467
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:01,960
Dad and Mom said it was appendicitis.

468
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,520
She didn't make it after the surgery.

469
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,870
Honestly, I don't believe them.

470
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,390
That's surprising to hear.

471
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:13,760
I thought you never questioned Mom.

472
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,480
I didn't think
you wouldn't believe them.

473
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,760
Because every time they talk
about Qiao Beiyu,

474
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,600
they avoid the topic.

475
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,280
People only avoid it
when they're hiding something.

476
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,590
So, what do you think really happened?

477
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:26,000
I don't know.

478
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,800
But today, I asked Jinrui.

479
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,560
It was appendicitis.

480
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,150
Something went wrong during surgery.

481
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:35,080
Such a small illness and it killed her.

482
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,080
But everyone says it was AIDS.

483
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,240
People always believe
what they want to believe.

484
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,480
They never care about the truth.

485
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:50,110
Actually, I'm partly responsible
for what happened to Beiyu.

486
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,870
As her older brother,
I didn't watch her well.

487
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,040
And she just kept going down
the wrong path.

488
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,150
She was so young.

489
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,040
Her life had just started,

490
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:02,960
and it ended so suddenly.

491
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:07,240
Jinrui's answer was the same
as Mom and Dad's.

492
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:14,110
Maybe they're avoiding it
because they're just heartbroken.

493
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:18,320
Who wants to be kept reminded
of an old wound?

494
00:25:25,425 --> 00:25:29,890
(Huanzhou High School)

495
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:41,390
What is it?

496
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,680
I don't care if your dad
is the director of the hospital or not.

497
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,110
You were just spreading rumors.

498
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,080
Qiao Qingyu,

499
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:53,240
are you really not afraid
I'll reveal your secret?

500
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,600
Say whatever you want
because that's your mouth.

501
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,320
But don't think
you can threaten me anymore.

502
00:25:57,324 --> 00:25:59,360
(Despicable)

503
00:25:59,389 --> 00:26:00,240
Just wait and see.

504
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:02,720
Sheng,

505
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,320
what did she write?

506
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,240
Nothing.

507
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,590
A love letter?

508
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:09,280
What love letter?

509
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:09,640
Really?

510
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,560
Don't make stuff up.

511
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,110
Let me see it.

512
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:11,960
See what?

513
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:12,880
Just a quick look.

514
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,920
There's nothing to see.

515
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,440
Go away!

516
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,280
Come on, just a peek.

517
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,440
Sheng, come on. Show me.

518
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,600
Do you really want to see it?

519
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,240
Come on, Sheng.

520
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:21,720
Fine, I'm out of here.

521
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,190
Everyone, hand in your homework.

522
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,590
Qiao Qingyu, hand yours in.

523
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:54,390
Math, Chinese, Physics, Chemistry.

524
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:56,160
Don't tell me
you didn't do a single one?

525
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,720
I did all of them. I even brought them.
They were here just now.

526
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,560
That's what Ye Zilin
and Chen Hao always say

527
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,040
when they don't do their homework.

528
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,760
I don't have time to wait.

529
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,960
I'm sending these now.

530
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:10,560
Class monitor, same rule as always.

531
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,400
Whether you didn't do it
or forgot to bring it,

532
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,830
copy it three times as punishment.

533
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:16,000
What's it to you?

534
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,870
Not bringing it and not doing it
aren't the same.

535
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:57,720
Sheng,

536
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,110
when did you come home?

537
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,630
Why didn't you tell me early?

538
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,320
What's there to say?

539
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,830
I'm leaving soon anyway.

540
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:10,480
Stop right there.

541
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,350
You come and go as you like.

542
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,630
This is your home, not a hotel.

543
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:21,150
My home is the old house
in Chaoyang New Village.

544
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:22,190
This is your home.

545
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:23,320
This is also your home.

546
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:32,520
Usually,

547
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:35,240
I barely see you here.

548
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,880
But whenever you run out of money
and need living expenses,

549
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,720
you always show up.

550
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,520
How much money
have I ever asked you for?

551
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,280
Please note down every cent.

552
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,000
After I graduate from the university,

553
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,630
I'll pay you back every bit
with interest.

554
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:48,110
I'm your father.

555
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:49,590
I only have Grandpa and Mom.

556
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,590
I have no father.

557
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:51,280
I...

558
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,760
Since I was young,

559
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,360
Grandpa takes me to school,
attends parent-teacher meetings,

560
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,150
and pays my fees.

561
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:58,000
You?

562
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,830
What did you do?

563
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,480
I was too busy with work.

564
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,670
Excuses!

565
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:08,280
You deserved it when Mom left you,

566
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,190
do you know that?

567
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,280
To others,

568
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,720
you're a doctor who saves lives.

569
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,870
But to me,

570
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,960
you're just a selfish man.

571
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:16,350
People like you

572
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:17,800
don't deserve a family.

573
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,280
You...

574
00:29:25,256 --> 00:29:30,530
(Mingde Building)

575
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:31,720
Come on.

576
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,040
Move faster! Hurry up!

577
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:36,800
Start running! Keep up, everyone!

578
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,960
Run faster!

579
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:42,430
Ye Zilin! You're late again!

580
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:43,240
Hurry!

581
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:50,760
Miss!

582
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:53,240
Qiao Qingyu stained her pants.

583
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,760
Qingyu,

584
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,110
go clean up in the bathroom.

585
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:06,000
Move it!

586
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:12,150
Jiang Nian.

587
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,760
I remember you have
a spare school uniform.

588
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,910
Can I borrow it?

589
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:17,390
It's not convenient.

590
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:23,000
Qingyu.

591
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:27,040
Is it true your sister, Qiao Beiyu,
died of AIDS?

592
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:13,870
What's your problem?

593
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:15,320
Was it you who spread the rumor?

594
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,110
What did I say?

595
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:19,430
Was it you who told everyone
about Qiao Beiyu?

596
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:21,190
You're ridiculous.

597
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:22,150
You're despicable.

598
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,110
Qiao Qingyu,

599
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:26,720
can you not just insult people
like that?

600
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,880
You started it.

601
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,390
That's why I said you're ridiculous.

602
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,160
You don't even know what happened.

603
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,800
How can you start questioning me
like this?

604
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,040
Borrow a jacket
from the other students.

605
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,670
Don't catch a cold.

606
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:52,040
Look here.

607
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:55,280
AIDS mainly spreads through blood,

608
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:58,080
sexual contact, or from mother to baby.

609
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,870
It doesn't spread through the air.

610
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:01,110
Stop talking.

611
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:02,830
Move!

612
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:04,430
I want to sleep.

613
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:09,350
Look at this.

614
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:19,150
That girl, Qiao Beiyu.

615
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:21,150
Her parents once sued the hospital

616
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:22,800
for medical negligence.

617
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,830
Remember that?

618
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,830
Your dad was in charge of that case.

619
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:31,280
In the end,
the hospital wasn't responsible.

620
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:33,240
But the mediation committee suggested

621
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,390
giving a bit of compensation.

622
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,120
You only wore these new pants
for a few days,

623
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,590
and now look at them. They're stained.

624
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,040
I can't even wash off the stain.

625
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:45,720
You know this.

626
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,760
Your dad and I borrowed
tens of thousands of yuan

627
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,280
just to send you two to school.

628
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,960
Jinyu is thoughtless
because he's still young.

629
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,240
Why are you no better?

630
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,280
A classmate bumped
into me during recess.

631
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,150
It was just an accident.

632
00:33:58,150 --> 00:33:59,960
I've told you to stay away
from those kids.

633
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:02,670
I already said it was an accident.

634
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,110
I've told you so many times

635
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,240
to stay away
from those problematic kids,

636
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:08,240
or they'll drag you down with them.

637
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,960
Now you've learned your lesson,
haven't you?

638
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:11,670
I haven't lost anything.

639
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,520
Qiao Qingyu, listen here.

640
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,310
Birds of a feather flock together.

641
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,590
Stick with students who study well.

642
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,000
Making good friends is important.

643
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,000
Or else you'll suffer in the future,

644
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,520
and it will be too late to regret it.

645
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,590
Why is everyone against me?

646
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,840
It's just a pair of pants.

647
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,790
I'll wash them later.

648
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:37,960
Don't you dare.

649
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:43,590
I'll buy you a new pair.

650
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,840
Why didn't you tell
Dad and Mom you're bullied?

651
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:02,480
Dad doesn't care,

652
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:04,310
and you know what Mom is like.

653
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,310
If she finds out,

654
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:07,790
things will only get worse.

655
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,360
So, what are you going to do now?

656
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:11,360
Let them keep bullying you?

657
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:13,840
I need to find evidence.

658
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,750
What kind of evidence?

659
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,840
Real proof
of how Qiao Beiyu actually died.

660
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:22,520
We know the truth in our hearts.

661
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,840
She's already gone.

662
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,270
So no need to stir things up again.

663
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:26,920
If I want the bullying to stop,

664
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,310
I have to clear up the truth
about Qiao Beiyu's death.

665
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:32,670
Or else it won't matter
if I'm in Shunyun or Huanzhou.

666
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,960
It'll be the same everywhere.

667
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:42,110
Let's go.

668
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:02,000
All right, class.

669
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,520
Let's start the lesson.

670
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,720
(Searching "Appendicitis")
Turn to page 32 in your textbooks.

671
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:09,190
Today, we're going to look

672
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,400
at how to search for information
using online databases.

673
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:15,400
(Appendicitis mortality rate)
Databases are a key part of computing...

674
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,150
(Appendicitis surgery
is usually relatively simple.)

675
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:21,150
(Post-surgical death is rare.)

676
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:22,790
Now, turn on your computers

677
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:24,750
and create a new spreadsheet.

678
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:49,670
I'm Wang Mumu, from Year 12, Class 1.

679
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:52,520
I know. They've talked about you before.

680
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,480
I've heard of you too.

681
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,710
I've seen you in the neighborhood.
You're Qiao Qingyu.

682
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:00,880
I live on the 8th floor of Building 13
in Chaoyang New Village.

683
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:02,520
So we're basically neighbors.

684
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:02,920
Yes.

685
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,520
Wait, they know each other?

686
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,230
Why aren't you eating?

687
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,920
Our class is cleaning
the swimming pool today.

688
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,280
I'll leave after I finish eating.

689
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,710
Wow, Qiao Qingyu.

690
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:01,790
You lie without even blinking.

691
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,040
You should be an actress.

692
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:04,080
I didn't lie.

693
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:07,520
Then have you forgotten

694
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,000
about the things you looked up

695
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,750
in computer class today?

696
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,080
I've warned you.

697
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:16,080
Don't accuse people
without solid evidence.

698
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,190
Even if your dad's the director
of People's Hospital,

699
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:19,360
what does that prove?

700
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,590
Then what about this?

701
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,790
Everything

702
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,590
is written in black and white.

703
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:25,750
Give that to me.

704
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:26,880
I wouldn't dare.

705
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,360
I'm afraid you won't be able

706
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,440
to handle the truth.

707
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:32,790
Give it to me!

708
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,440
Give it!

709
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,110
Qingyu fell in the pool.

710
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:17,000
This isn't some kind of idol drama.
An action scene is more like it!

711
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:17,880
Hurry, help her!

712
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:30,400
I tricked you, silly.

713
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,790
You're so despicable.

714
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,360
Wait, how was I supposed

715
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,080
to know you'd risk your life
for that file?

716
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,710
Good thing I saved your life.

717
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,400
Let's just call it even now.

718
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,880
