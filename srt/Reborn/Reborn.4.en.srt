=Reborn=

14
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,080
(Adapted from the serialized work "Reborn"
by Qiang Yu)

15
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,790
Your uncle asked me to come by

16
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:38,150
just for peace of mind.

17
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:40,460
Make sure she doesn't have
another episode and wander off.

18
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,560
Remind your uncle that

19
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,950
he needs to keep a close eye on her.

20
00:01:45,544 --> 00:01:46,984
She can't take another shock.

21
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:49,950
Madam Xiuzhen,

22
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,980
you're a health worker
at the village clinic?

23
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:52,510
That's right.

24
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:53,950
Over 20 years now.

25
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,520
Every illness in this village,

26
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,540
I usually know about it.

27
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,230
Then do you know about Qiao Beiyu?

28
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,150
Beiyu, huh...

29
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,950
Of course I heard the rumors.

30
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,540
Everyone was talking.

31
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,670
But whether she really
had that kind of illness,

32
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,820
I don't know.

33
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,700
One thing though,

34
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,140
I remember very clearly.

35
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,630
During the winter holidays, when Beiyu
returned from Huanzhou Art School,

36
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:26,230
she had a miscarriage
and came to the clinic.

37
00:02:26,951 --> 00:02:29,540
Soon after, your mother came here too.

38
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:31,860
Fanghao.

39
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:34,910
Mom.

40
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:38,700
Mom.

41
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,670
A little girl in her twenties

42
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,110
suffered a miscarriage.

43
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:56,740
How pitiful.

44
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:58,110
The news

45
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,790
wasn't spread
by the people at the clinic.

46
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,020
However, bad news spread quickly.

47
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,300
Bei was too careless as well.

48
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,350
She suffered from such a misfortune
at a young age,

49
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:08,820
but she still didn't learn her lesson.

50
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,390
Later, she became worse.

51
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,580
Do you know who's that person?

52
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:18,070
I don't know who he is,

53
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:19,860
but with the kind of lifestyle
she is living,

54
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,950
the rumors are probably true.

55
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:25,630
She can't blame other people
for badmouthing her.

56
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:27,820
I'm leaving.

57
00:03:30,297 --> 00:03:39,180
=Episode 4=
(Lie? Truth!)

58
00:03:39,231 --> 00:03:41,985
(Ming Qiuxin:
Wait until I get off work if you're free.)

59
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:43,540
(Let's eat together.)

60
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,820
What a coincidence.

61
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,390
A major surgery was cancelled suddenly.

62
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,910
I get a few hours of break.

63
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,630
We can have a meal together.

64
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,700
Dr. Ming, do you still remember
what my favourite food is?

65
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,390
You've liked pizza since you were young.

66
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,980
There's a new pizza shop
in front of the hospital.

67
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,030
We can give it a try.

68
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,270
I liked eating pizza when I was young,

69
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,860
but that was when I was six or seven.

70
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,300
I'm 17 years old now.

71
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,710
I've stopped eating pizza

72
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,670
since my mother left me.

73
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:29,980
It was you

74
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:32,790
who made me leave my mother since young.

75
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,740
You didn't even tell me

76
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,030
when my grandfather was dying.

77
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:42,420
You were preparing
for your high school exam.

78
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,400
I was afraid
that it might affect your studies.

79
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,060
Was my high school exam important?

80
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,830
Was the biology competition important?

81
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,740
Were they more important

82
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,620
than my bond with Grandpa and Mom?

83
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,640
They were all in the past.

84
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,880
There's no need to mention it.

85
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,540
Let's eat.

86
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,830
I tried to understand you

87
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,060
but you've never changed.

88
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,180
Have dinner on your own.

89
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,620
(You only care about your patients)

90
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,620
(and your surgeries.)

91
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,540
(What about Sheng and me?)

92
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,030
(Have you cared about us?)

93
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,180
I can see

94
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,380
all the sacrifices you've made.

95
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,540
Can you understand
where I'm coming from?

96
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,540
I did

97
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,710
and I sympathized with you.

98
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:37,500
(What about you?)

99
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,150
(Sheng also needs a father)

100
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:41,030
(who can grow up with him.)

101
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:42,160
(I'm sorry.)

102
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,240
(I don't need your apology.)

103
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,380
You can be summoned
by a phone call every time.

104
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,540
(Every time!)

105
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:50,230
(Why must I and Sheng
sacrifice ourselves)

106
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:52,380
(to make you into a good doctor?)

107
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,350
(I've had enough of this life.)

108
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:58,270
Mom, don't go.

109
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,670
Mom!

110
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:25,620
(Let me carry you.)

111
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:26,620
(Good.)

112
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:28,270
(Slowly.)

113
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,270
All right.

114
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:37,620
(Slowly.)

115
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,030
(Are you standing still?)

116
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:40,300
(Yes.)

117
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,590
(All right.)

118
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:44,540
(Hold me.)

119
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:45,470
(It's fine.)

120
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:46,030
(Stand still.)

121
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,230
Sheng, listen.

122
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:49,740
To what?

123
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,670
The leaves are rustling in the wind.

124
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,380
The birds are singing.

125
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,150
Sheng, look.

126
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:03,710
There's a bird.

127
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,270
It's flying past.

128
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:09,230
The sound of waves made by the river.

129
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,110
Do you hear it?

130
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,350
When you are in a bad mood,

131
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:14,230
listen to the sounds of nature.

132
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:15,620
They are magical.

133
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:17,470
The more you listen,

134
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:20,110
the calmer you'll feel.

135
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:22,420
Then, you'll be able
to forget all the noise.

136
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,150
All right?

137
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:23,830
All right.

138
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,180
Give it a try.

139
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,030
Hello, is it Ming Sheng?

140
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:47,590
Hello.

141
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,350
I want to talk to my mother.

142
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,030
Sorry.

143
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,600
Anna is in the recording booth now.

144
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,590
If it's something urgent,

145
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:55,830
I'll tell her after she's done.

146
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,300
It's nothing.

147
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:58,590
Forget it, then.

148
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,710
(Have you seen it?)

149
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,120
(Huanzhou People's Hospital,
Qiao Beiyu's Scanned Medical Records)

150
00:08:26,657 --> 00:08:28,810
(Report of HIV Antibody

(Conclusion, Positive)

153
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:37,710
(I've contacted them.)

154
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:39,620
(The hospital will mail it later.)

155
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,350
(Remember to receive it.)

156
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,020
(Sometimes,)

157
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,310
(we try our best to find the answer,)

158
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,430
(and when we finally do,)

159
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,470
(even though everything is resolved,)

160
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,190
(it also means)

161
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:56,140
(all our efforts were in vain.)

162
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,260
There's a lot of rain this year.

163
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,160
There's waterlogging of fruit trees.

164
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:02,980
Most trees are dead.

165
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,720
If we don't spray some insecticide
to get rid of pests,

166
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,240
we won't have any crops to harvest.

167
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:07,900
Qingyu!

168
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,900
Doesn't the land
belong to Uncle Haisheng's family?

169
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,860
Why do they order us
to work for them for free?

170
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:15,350
Why isn't she back yet?

171
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,860
We are all a family.

172
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,430
What are you talking about?

173
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:20,350
Besides,

174
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:23,110
didn't you eat Uncle Haisheng's fruit?

175
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:24,310
How can you put your feet here?

176
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:26,190
Haisheng was a clerk in the village,

177
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,660
but he lost his job.

178
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:31,000
I can't even move my feet.

179
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,830
I'm staying home for two days
starting tomorrow.

180
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:36,120
Put your legs down. That's very rude.

181
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,240
Jiangsheng, have some water.

182
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:38,950
I'm not drinking.

183
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:40,500
Give me a glass.

184
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,310
Me too.

185
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,360
You're back?

186
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,560
Do you know what time it is?

187
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,500
Why are you so late?

188
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:57,950
I went to the library.

189
00:09:59,070 --> 00:09:59,900
Don't you know

190
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:00,980
what time it is?

191
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,900
I forgot about the time.

192
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,560
It's a good thing
for Qing to love to study.

193
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,120
Those who study at Huanzhou High School

194
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,710
can all get
into a famous high university.

195
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:10,470
Just enjoy the rest of your life.

196
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,900
I'm going back to my room.

197
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:13,710
Me too.

198
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,020
Qingyu.

199
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:19,430
I'm being serious.

200
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,020
It's very late

201
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,260
and it's dark.

202
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,230
What if you encounter a bad person?

203
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:26,470
Every girl

204
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:28,020
is already home at this hour.

205
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,020
You make me anxious.

206
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,900
I know. I'll be more careful next time.

207
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:32,950
You must remember.

208
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:34,590
She said she was late

209
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:35,980
because she was reading.

210
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,230
She didn't do it on purpose.

211
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:39,620
Go back and sleep.

212
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:44,350
Wait,

213
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,660
why doesn't Qingyu need to work?

214
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,260
She's the only one who can have peace.

215
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,590
I want to go to the library too.

216
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,160
Why do you want to go there?

217
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:51,710
Read books.

218
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:54,260
I'm sure
you're going there to play games.

219
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,380
All of you are biased.

220
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:12,500
Yu,

221
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:16,080
I finally know why Mom and Dad

222
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,710
won't explain
Qiao Beiyu's cause of death.

223
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,110
Why?

224
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:22,590
Because the rumors are the truth.

225
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:23,550
What?

226
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:27,190
Are you saying that she died from AIDS?

227
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,070
Although I was reluctant
to admit it in the past,

228
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:31,430
I subconsciously figured

229
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:33,080
there was something wrong

230
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,430
with Qiao Beiyu's cause of death

231
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,660
because the reaction from Mom and Dad,
her friends, and family members

232
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:40,710
would only make sense

233
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:41,950
if she had that disease.

234
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:45,660
However, Mom and Dad kept denying it

235
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:49,190
so I thought there was
more to her illness than meets the eye.

236
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:52,350
All the effort I put in
to clear her name

237
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,830
was in vain.

238
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:54,880
What evidence did you find?

239
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,780
She had a medical record
at the People's Hospital.

240
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,600
She did have the disease

241
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,660
that everyone talked about.

242
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:04,020
Our whole family still has to suffer.

243
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:05,110
What?

244
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:07,190
It seems like those rumors are all true.

245
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:08,860
Moreover,

246
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,740
she had a miscarriage
at Nanqiao Village.

247
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:13,710
Really?

248
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:16,430
How do you know that?

249
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:17,740
I met Aunt Xiuzhen today.

250
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,380
She told me about it.

251
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,140
Do you think

252
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:23,950
this is the man who caused her death?

253
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,830
Don't say something without evidence.

254
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:29,550
(I must find out)

255
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,660
(who this person is.)

256
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:44,310
Mumu.

257
00:12:46,762 --> 00:12:47,860
Help me out.

258
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,740
Give this to Mingsheng.

259
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,230
Remember.

260
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:53,800
Don't tell him

261
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,800
that I was the one
who asked you to give it to him.

262
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,470
Don't worry.

263
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:00,660
Thank you.

264
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:01,740
Goodbye.

265
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:15,660
Nice.

266
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,740
Check the ball.

267
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:19,350
Look.

268
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:21,020
Is he handsome?

269
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:21,860
So handsome.

270
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,740
This picture is really handsome.

271
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,590
I'm making it my computer wallpaper.

272
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:27,830
Sheng!

273
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:30,020
Play without me.

274
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,020
Let's take a break.

275
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,190
Let's rest for a while.

276
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:41,500
Why do they know each other?

277
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:44,380
It's the smell of jealousy.

278
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:45,740
What is it?

279
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,310
It's sweet and sour. Very delicious.

280
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,600
Mumu is so pretty.

281
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,660
She's also an ace student.

282
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,740
What are they two talking about?

283
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,000
Compared to her,

284
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,920
we're nothing more than
trimmed side characters.

285
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:00,140
Both of you are side characters,

286
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:00,950
but I'm not.

287
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:04,920
Exclusive news.

288
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,830
Do you want to hear it?

289
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:06,980
What is it?

290
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:07,740
Tell me.

291
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,550
I'll buy you a week's worth of yogurt.

292
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,470
Rumor has it
that Mingsheng and Wang Mumu

293
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,230
were childhood friends

294
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,400
who grew up together.

295
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,620
Do you know the Three Kingdoms?

296
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,800
The Oath of the Peach Garden.

297
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:22,310
They are like sworn brothers.

298
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:23,620
It's pure brotherhood.

299
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,830
The Oath of the Peach Garden?

300
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,190
Isn't that a story of three men?

301
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:27,780
She's a woman.

302
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,310
Hey.

303
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:32,500
It's just a comparison.

304
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:35,190
Whatever.

305
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:17,380
Over here.

306
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,550
Have you waited for a long time?

307
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:19,950
No.

308
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:20,740
I just arrived.

309
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,740
It's fine. Ignore them.

310
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,190
I bought you milk tea.

311
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,380
Thank you.

312
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:31,950
Oh, right.

313
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:35,230
I don't get this essay question.

314
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,710
What do you think?

315
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:40,780
(White lies are a complicated issue.)
How do you see a white lie?

316
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,550
Lies are lies.

317
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:46,500
Even if it's a white lie,

318
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,190
it won't change the fact
that it's a lie.

319
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:49,190
However, a white lie

320
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,620
is told for your good.

321
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:53,190
It's all self-opinionated.

322
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,470
Using the name of helping others

323
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:57,110
just to cause greater harm.

324
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,020
Is the truth

325
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:01,190
really that important to you?

326
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:08,190
Have you thought about

327
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:10,350
the fact that the truth is too cruel

328
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,400
to the point that you can't accept it?

329
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,020
I can accept it

330
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,950
and also bear all the consequences.

331
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,120
It might be different for everyone.

332
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,620
There's another one.

333
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:35,830
Qiao Qingyu.

334
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:36,980
Mom.

335
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:38,660
Come home with me.

336
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,320
Hello, Mrs. Qiao.

337
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:39,980
I am Qingyu's...

338
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:40,980
I don't care who you are.

339
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,320
Stay away from her in the future.

340
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:43,070
Let's go.

341
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:45,110
Qingyu.

342
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:46,380
Mrs. Qiao.

343
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:48,260
Mrs. Qiao!

344
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:49,900
Qingyu.

345
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:10,990
It's delicious.

346
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:14,140
Here you go.
Your favourite sweet and sour flavour.

347
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,040
Actually, I can't cook well.

348
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,520
My grandfather taught me how to cook.

349
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,310
Today is the Mid-autumn Festival.

350
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,640
When Grandpa was still around,

351
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,790
he would treat us
and celebrate the festival together.

352
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:45,790
When I was young,

353
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,990
he used to take me to buy this.

354
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:52,620
He knew how to bake
mooncakes with egg yolks.

355
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,270
He knew
the place with the best lanterns.

356
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:58,700
But now,

357
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,790
he is no longer here.

358
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,510
Grandpa might not be around,
but I'm still here.

359
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:18,860
A friend of mine gave me this.

360
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,110
Since you like basketball,

361
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,830
I'm giving it to you instead.

362
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,220
How nice.

363
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:38,900
Is your friend

364
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,660
Ming Qiuxin?

365
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,590
Mr. Ming's things

366
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:48,900
always smell of disinfectants.

367
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:56,990
Is your relationship
with Mr. Ming still bad?

368
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:06,660
Grandpa was gravely ill back then.

369
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,940
The ventilator

370
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:10,620
was only used
to forcefully extend his life.

371
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,270
Mr. Ming is the best surgical doctor
in the whole county.

372
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:15,310
Although he gave up treatment,

373
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:17,220
I believe he made

374
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,750
the best choice for Grandpa.

375
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,030
They are different matters.

376
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,550
Of course, I know he is a skilled doctor

377
00:19:23,942 --> 00:19:24,860
but I hate him.

378
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,550
Why do I hate him?

379
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,070
Because he didn't give
Grandpa the right to choose.

380
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,550
He decided on Grandpa's death
on his own.

381
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:32,310
As for me,

382
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,960
I didn't even have the right
to know about it.

383
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,400
Perhaps he thought

384
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,320
the decision was better
for both Grandpa and you.

385
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:45,040
That was his wishful thinking.

386
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,510
He thought he did it for my own good,

387
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,900
but that wasn't the case.

388
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,590
Take this back to him.

389
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,000
I won't accept
his insincere attempts to flatter me.

390
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:56,380
One day,

391
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,380
I will leave this home

392
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:00,860
and escape from him completely.

393
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,180
Didn't you go read books at the library?

394
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,220
I was going to read books.

395
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,510
I met Ma Mingkai at the library
by chance.

396
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:23,270
By chance?

397
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,030
Isn't that too convenient?

398
00:20:27,462 --> 00:20:29,510
You've been acting suspiciously
in the last two days.

399
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:31,310
Did you spend last night with him?

400
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,000
I didn't.

401
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,640
Qingyu, are you still going to deny it?

402
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,940
I asked the people at the library.

403
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,790
You weren't even there last night.

404
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,070
We are just classmates.

405
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,320
It's not what you think.

406
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,520
Qiao Qingyu, I'm telling you.

407
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,460
Qiao Beiyu

408
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,180
used to say the same thing to me.

409
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,380
Learning is important,

410
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,600
but your reputation is more important.

411
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,900
The outside world is full of temptations

412
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:57,900
for a girl your age.

413
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,380
You can't make any mistakes.

414
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,180
Do you know that?

415
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,160
You can make up for your studies,

416
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,120
but what will you do
if your reputation is ruined?

417
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,440
Your name will forever be stained.

418
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,840
You have to carry it forever.
Your sister is the best example.

419
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,890
People kept badmouthing her
even after she was gone.

420
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:10,680
Don't you know that?

421
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,000
Do you want to be the same as her?

422
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:23,620
From tomorrow onwards,

423
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,590
you are not allowed
to be with any boys alone

424
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:26,830
under any circumstances.

425
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,510
Do you understand?

426
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,310
Otherwise, I'll ask your brother
to keep an eye on you.

427
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,600
He'll follow you wherever you go.

428
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,860
Qingyu, why are you sitting here?

429
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:16,830
Bei?

430
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:18,830
Come here.

431
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,030
Come here.

432
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:31,750
Bei!

433
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:32,480
Hurry!

434
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,220
Where are we going?

435
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:35,030
Where are we going?

436
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:36,510
Let's go. Let's leave this place.

437
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,110
We'll go and find your parents.

438
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,070
Where are we going?

439
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,590
Wenqiu?

440
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:44,110
Wenqiu!

441
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:46,110
Wenqiu!

442
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:47,590
Wenqiu!

443
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:48,940
Wenqiu!

444
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,940
You're running around again.

445
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,310
Why are you running?

446
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,460
(Beiyu)

447
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:58,571
(Beiyu)

448
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:02,830
Let's go.

449
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:03,310
Wenqiu.

450
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,320
Stop running.

451
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,220
Let's go home and eat.

452
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,510
Leave me alone.

453
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,380
Qing, go home.

454
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:07,940
Let's go.

455
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:08,320
Don't!

456
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,701
Who will care about you if I don't?

457
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:10,660
Don't...

458
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,510
Let me go.

459
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:13,510
Let's go home and eat.

460
00:23:14,807 --> 00:23:16,460
After that,
let's go and pick some flowers.

461
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,680
We'll go and pick some flowers.

462
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,360
Let's go, Qing.

463
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:22,420
Let me see.

464
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:30,350
Should we call Uncle Jiangsheng?

465
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,380
They just took their dinner.

466
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,310
Eat.

467
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:34,590
Just eat and leave them alone.

468
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,140
Stop crying.

469
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,460
Just eat.

470
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:43,420
I can't keep an eye on you for 24 hours.

471
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:46,140
I can't do this alone.

472
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,310
Aunt Qin is so pitiful.

473
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,270
Uncle Jiangsheng's life is tougher.

474
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,420
It's the most tiring
to take care of someone.

475
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,400
Especially an illness like this.

476
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,660
Nothing can be done at home.

477
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:01,590
Jiangsheng took her
to the hospital multiple times.

478
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,110
No one can take it

479
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,220
after a long time.

480
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:05,940
You're always crying!

481
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,030
Why are you crying?

482
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:10,590
I'm having a hard time
working in the field every day.

483
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:13,070
I still have to spend time
looking for you.

484
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,180
Stop crying.

485
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,420
Why are you running around?

486
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:19,220
You only know how to cry.

487
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,510
Can you let me worry less?

488
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:24,380
Can you let me worry less?

489
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,740
(Love is the most radiant element here,
yet also the fuse of catastrophe.)

490
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,800
Let's go. Let's leave this place.

491
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,110
We'll go and find your parents.

492
00:25:06,065 --> 00:25:08,410
(Beiyu)

493
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:09,980
(My Life by Isadora Duncan)

494
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:32,900
Jinyu, get up.

495
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,220
What's wrong?

496
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,380
Quick, get up.

497
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:52,990
Are you crazy?

498
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:55,460
Why do you come
to the cemetery at night?

499
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,900
You're bringing me along as well.

500
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,350
You're here to give me courage.

501
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:01,750
I... I'm a coward.

502
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:05,030
Are you still a man?

503
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:08,940
Hold it.

504
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:15,750
It's raining.

505
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,070
I hope it doesn't pour later.

506
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:28,030
Is this Beiyu's grave?

507
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:32,750
Someone in Nanqiao village
actually still remembers her.

508
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:49,990
Don't you hate her?

509
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:52,350
Why do you come here at night
to burn joss papers for her?

510
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,510
I do hate her,

511
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,900
but I feel bad for her as well.

512
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:18,460
You treasure this photo so much.

513
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:20,590
Take it with you.

514
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,550
When Beiyu was buried,

515
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:04,070
Mom and Dad wouldn't let us come here.

516
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,790
She was pretty when she was alive.

517
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:08,110
I didn't expect her

518
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:10,620
to be buried in a shabby place
after she died.

519
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,180
Qingyu, is that our house?

520
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:17,270
It's on fire.

521
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,620
I heard there was a fire last night.

522
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,220
Let's go and take a look.

523
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,420
Seriously. It's so dangerous.

524
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:34,660
It's really serious.
The fire was really bad.

525
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:36,940
Which house is on fire?

526
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,790
Qin's house.

527
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:40,220
They have so many things to clean up.

528
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:46,460
Qiao, your house was on fire last night.

529
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,380
What happened?

530
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:49,180
I heard Qin was smoking last night.

531
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:51,750
The cigarette wasn't extinguished
and it caused the fire.

532
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:53,590
The crazy woman burned the place.

533
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:54,940
Thankfully, it was noticed sooner.

534
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,110
Otherwise,

535
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,940
the whole place would be burned down.

536
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,070
It was really dangerous.

537
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:01,620
Qiao, are they all right?

538
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:03,660
They are fine.

539
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:06,460
Jiangsheng was sent to the hospital
last night.

540
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,660
Everything has been burned down.

541
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:11,420
Whether they live or die
is still unknown.

542
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,790
Do you need our help?

543
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:13,600
No need.

544
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,110
All of you can leave. Stop watching.

545
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:18,310
Stop watching.

546
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:19,940
Go back. Stop watching.

547
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:21,900
We are just trying to help. Let's go.

548
00:29:35,425 --> 00:29:37,080
(Regardless of relationship and bond...)

549
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:42,860
Mom. Dad. Should we go back now?

550
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,271
(Regardless of relationship and bond,
it's the end of my fate.)

551
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,800
(He is the only one who loves me.)
(I fell in love with him.)

552
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:02,440
(I went to get an abortion.)
(He took my first time. I love him.)

553
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:06,380
(He is the only person
I can rely on in Nanqiao Village.)

554
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:35,070
Mom and Dad are used
to staying at the old house.

555
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:39,830
We can gather the money.

556
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:41,940
Then, I'll think of something.

557
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:16,990
Mom.

558
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:21,140
Mom.

559
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,270
It's going to rain soon.

560
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,830
Just now, you looked like

561
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:47,940
a bird that was going to fly.

562
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:53,990
Have you grown taller again?

563
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,990
I was already this tall last year.

564
00:31:59,550 --> 00:31:59,900
Oh.

565
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,460
Let's go. It's going to rain.

566
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:25,210
(Mingde Building)

567
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:27,110
Why do I feel dizzy
seeing with my left eye?

568
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:29,940
Darn it.

569
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,510
Be careful. Mr. Sun is here.

570
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,660
Mingsheng is looking at you.

571
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,350
He was staring at you.

572
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:49,660
Turn around. Stop staring.

573
00:33:02,102 --> 00:33:04,130
(High-precision digital spirometer)

574
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:07,830
All right. Good.

575
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:08,460
Next.

576
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:29,660
Excuse me, have you seen my shoes?

577
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:30,420
I haven't.

578
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:32,550
Excuse me, have you seen my shoes?

579
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:33,350
No.

580
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:37,270
Did someone see Qiao Qingyu's shoes?

581
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:40,510
Qiao Qingyu's shoes are gone!

582
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:49,750
Quiet!

583
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:52,700
Did anyone see Qiao Qingyu's shoes?

584
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,790
Take them out immediately.

585
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:04,750
Everyone.

586
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,940
After the
National Day Golden Week holiday,

587
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:07,790
The Year 11 students

588
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:09,870
will be separated into
Art Stream and Science Streams.

589
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:11,800
Only a few of you
will go to the Art Stream class.

590
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,140
The remaining students

591
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:15,740
will form the brand new
Science Stream Class 5 Year 11.

592
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:16,590
Great!

593
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,340
All right, Students.

594
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,550
Since the classes are formed,

595
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:21,660
that means

596
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:23,510
we are one more step closer to the NCEE.

597
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:24,910
I don't want all of you

598
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:26,320
to relax

599
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,820
when it's time for you to work hard.

600
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:28,700
Right now,

601
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,340
I have to do something corny

602
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,990
and give a motivational quote

603
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:33,340
regarding the NCEE.

604
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,820
The soldiers' war
is fought on battlefields.

605
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,400
The workers' war is fought in factories.

606
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,950
Where is our war as students?

607
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:41,030
In the classroom.

608
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:42,910
All right.

609
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:44,780
I know all of you are
sick of hearing this.

610
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:45,550
I hope

611
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:47,800
the atmosphere by the end of the year

612
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,840
is like this
when you get your year-end exam results.

613
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:52,950
Let me emphasize this again.

614
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,430
Remember your attendance.

615
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:56,390
Don't be late.

616
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,470
You are in different streams now.

617
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,910
The headmaster is watching closely.

618
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:00,620
Do you hear me?

619
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:02,140
Yes!

620
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,110
Dismissed.

621
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:06,910
Thank you, Teacher!

622
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:13,430
Sheng!

623
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:14,660
Sheng!

624
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:15,550
Let's exercise.

625
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:16,660
Oh. Go ahead.

626
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,780
Sure. We'll go and take the court first.

627
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:23,030
Are you done?

628
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:24,260
Wait for me.

629
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:26,740
Let's go.

630
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,300
I don't feel like going home.

631
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:29,590
Me neither.

632
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,510
Since it's still early,

633
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:33,470
why don't we go play the claw machines?

634
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:34,070
Let's go.

635
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:43,550
Help me throw them. You're on duty.

636
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:36,720
Sheng,
I've been waiting for you for so long.

637
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,660
What are you looking at?

638
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:39,590
Nothing.

639
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:42,220
Are you stalking Qiao Qingyu?

640
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:43,510
Why would I stalk her?

641
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:44,470
Am I crazy or what?

642
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:45,740
Let's go and play basketball.

643
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:46,260
No.

644
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:47,180
Why?

645
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,110
I'm busy so I'll be leaving.

646
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:56,110
Why do Qiao Qingyu's shoes

647
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:57,820
look the same as Sheng's?

648
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:59,300
Are they Sheng's shoes?

649
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:00,990
Let's go and play some basketball.

650
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:02,870
I know.

651
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:04,910
I'm going back to the shop.

652
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:05,480
Sure. Tell him

653
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,840
that I'll return in 20 minutes.

654
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,430
That's all.

655
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,300
Whose shoes are these?

656
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,340
Where are your shoes?

657
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,040
I lost my shoes.

658
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,220
I picked up someone else's shoes
from the rubbish bin.

659
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:19,840
You're an adult.

660
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,070
How did you lose your shoes?

661
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:22,260
Where did you leave them?

662
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,990
Moreover, the shoes look fine.

663
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:26,300
Why would someone throw them away?

664
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:29,300
Qiao Qingyu.

665
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,840
You'd never find these shoes
in the trash

666
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,340
unless someone wants you to wear them.

667
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:32,960
What's going on?

668
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,320
Why don't you wear your own shoes

669
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:35,510
but a pair of men's shoes?

670
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:36,740
That was what happened.

671
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:37,990
I lost my shoes.

672
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:39,990
Coincidentally, a kind-hearted man

673
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:42,070
threw away a pair of new shoes
which you picked up?

674
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,870
You don't even lie with logic.

675
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,820
A girl putting on a pair of men's shoes.

676
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:49,390
Where are your principles?

677
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:50,660
What happened? Tell me!

678
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:52,660
You're back?

679
00:37:59,030 --> 00:37:59,740
Mom.

680
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:02,620
Qingyu was bullied

681
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:04,510
in school.

682
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:06,620
For some reason, Qiao Beiyu's incident

683
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:08,030
was dug out.

684
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:11,430
The rumor spread like wildfire
on the internet.

685
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:12,660
Not just Qingyu.

686
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:15,300
I'm also affected at the Sports School.

687
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:28,220
Qingyu, I was too anxious just now.

688
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:32,260
I know you've been aggrieved in school.

689
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:35,180
Why didn't you tell me anything?

690
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,780
You've been looking gloomy

691
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,440
since coming back from Nanqiao Village.

692
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,550
You don't even speak a lot.

693
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,780
I can't read minds

694
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,550
and I'm busy working at the shop.

695
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,260
You need to tell me
if something happens to you, right?

696
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:55,590
Qingyu, we spent so much effort

697
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:56,910
to come here to study

698
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,110
for the sake of
getting into a good university

699
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:00,510
and having a better future.

700
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:01,820
At a time like this,

701
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:03,950
we need to endure it.

702
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,070
We have to lie low and stay humble.

703
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:07,620
We can't explain things sometimes.

704
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:09,390
The more you try to explain,
the worse it gets.

705
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:12,640
No matter how badly they talk about you,

706
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,300
just endure it and it'll be over.

707
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,070
As time goes on,

708
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,640
everything will be forgotten.

709
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:22,910
I must leave.

710
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,910
Lunch is ready. It's in the pot.

711
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:29,300
I have to rush back to the shop.

712
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,990
If I hadn't told the truth,

713
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:49,740
you'd still be getting
an earful even now.

714
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:52,550
What did Mom tell you?

715
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:54,620
Nothing much.

716
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:58,070
I heard her say many things to you.

717
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:00,470
She's always doing this.

718
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:02,590
She wants me to tell her everything,

719
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:03,870
but she's also stubborn

720
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:05,550
and wants me
to follow everything she says.

721
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,780
I think
she doesn't want to listen to me at all.

722
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:10,030
Maybe adults are all like that.

723
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:14,740
Actually,

724
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:18,590
if you don't agree with her,
just forget about it.

725
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:20,870
Everyone said Qiao Beiyu was bad

726
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:22,470
and badmouthed her.

727
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:24,110
However, did anyone think about

728
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:26,220
what Qiao Beiyu experienced
when she was alive?

729
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,430
What did she experience
when she was alive?

730
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:34,950
The person who caused her miscarriage

731
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:36,780
must take responsibility for her death.

732
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,740
Even if we find him,

733
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:40,430
the dead cannot be revived.

734
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:43,550
Even so, we can't just forget about it.

735
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:46,550
Qiao Beiyu was so pretty.

736
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:49,470
She did have many boyfriends.

737
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:51,070
I saw a few of them personally.

738
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:54,220
However, who was

739
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:56,110
the Nanqiao Village boyfriend?

740
