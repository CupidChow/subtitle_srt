(Adapted from the serialized work "Reborn"
by Qiang Yu)

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,200
You're not like her.

16
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,410
You are

17
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:42,920
the innocent type.

18
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,720
Actually, I knew what your sister

19
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,810
was thinking back then.

20
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,720
She did it for you.
She cared about you.

21
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,720
Even though you were still young,

22
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,720
she didn't want you
to get mixed up with someone like me.

23
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,640
But it didn't work.

24
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,720
We know each other now,
and it's not too late.

25
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,810
Also, just look at you.

26
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,480
You've really grown into a beauty.

27
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,000
Even prettier than before.

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,720
Don't touch me.

29

00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:09,320

What if I do?

32
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,480
Don't touch me!

33
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:11,480
Hey, what are you doing?

34
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,200
From now on, you're mine.
Your sister owed me. You'll pay it back.

35
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,250
Hei, your car got smashed!

36
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,000
Who did it?

37
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:17,530
Who smashed my car?

38
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,810
Don't worry.

39
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:49,810
They won't catch up.

40
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,250
You smashed his car?

why you're hanging around
with those thugs,

44

but I really don't think

45
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,320
they'll let this go so easily.

46
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,560
Thanks for the heads-up.

47
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,690
I'll be careful for now.

48
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,840
Alright, just call me Mumu from now on.

49
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,250
I'll call you Qingyu.

Yeah, I'm full.

Boss, check, please.

62
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,000
Which table?

63
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,730
Table four.

64
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,730
Three bowls of
pork chop noodles, 36 yuan.

It's fine.

68
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:17,290
You're Qiao Beiyu's mom, right?

69
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,250
She and I go way back.

70
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,880

Why bother with the change, right?

74
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,000
You must be mistaken.

75
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I don't know who you're talking about.

76
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,290

Where is she?

Why ignore me like that?

92
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:10,850
It's a misunderstanding, Ms. Ma.

93
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,200
She didn't mean it.

94
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,690
How about this?

95
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:15,560

come to the shop for now.

trying to scare us.

it's just the two of us here.
We can't keep up with the work.

my own foot basin.

are nowhere near as comfortable
as our old home.

You can't compare
the countryside to the city.

Have a seat.

146

Qiao Huan's factory is closing down.

147
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:07,680
It's perfect timing.

148
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,330
She came to help at our shop.

00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,640
So starting today,

150
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,370
you two don't need to
go to the shop anymore.

151
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,370
Just come straight home after school.

152
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:15,850
I'll bring dinner back for you both.

156
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,970
just bear with us tonight

157
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,370
and sleep on the sofa for a night.

158
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:23,970
Okay.

159
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:24,800
Then tomorrow...

160
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,440
What's going on?

161
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,570
We'll move once we've packed.

162
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:28,280
How would I know if you don't?

163
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:41,040
Mom, what are you doing?

164
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,040
Throw all these clothes away.

165
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:44,880
You can't wear them at school anyway.

166
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,800
Why throw these clothes out?

167
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:49,370
They are too flashy.

168
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:51,490
How are these flashy?

169
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:52,520
What will I wear, then?

170
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,370
Don't you have school uniforms?

171
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:57,640
This one?

172
00:09:58,970 --> 00:09:59,680
It's cashmere.

173
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:00,730
It's brand new.

174
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:02,490
I haven't worn it once
in over two years.

175
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,370
It's nice and warm.

176
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,450
What?

177
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,280
Don't you think
Mom was acting strange today?

178
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:20,730
It's not like this is the first time
she's acted weird.

179
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,330
It'd be strange if she were ever normal.

180
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,210
Qiao Huan, my mom said

181
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:35,490
you used to work
at a clothing factory in Huanzhou.

182
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,610
Yeah.

183
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,450
I started working
when I was about your age.

184
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:42,680
It's been four or five years already.

185
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,210
Didn't you go to school?

186
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:45,880
I'm not like you.

187
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,640
I was never the studying type.

188
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:49,800
And in Nanqiao Village,

189
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,800
girls usually get married

190
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,920
right after middle school

191
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,640
or head off to work
to help out at home.

192
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,370
Only Beiyu got

193
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:56,610
to finish high school

194
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:57,450
and even college.

195
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:58,730
Yet, she was worse off than us.

196
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:04,000
Qingyu, that was rude of me.

197
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,370
Don't take it to heart.

198
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,680
It's alright.

199
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:09,760
But with so many
job opportunities in Huanzhou,

200
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,610
why'd you come work
at our little noodle shop?

201
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,760
Because it's easy work and decent pay.

202
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,400
And we're family, so everything's clear.

203
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,210
Your mom said she needed help urgently.

204
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,520
I figured I'd come to lend a hand,

205
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,450
and I came right over.

206
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,400
So the factory didn't shut down?

207
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,760
It was my mom who called you here?

208
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,000
Yeah.

209
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,730
I mean, the factory really did close.

210
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:32,210
Don't mind my bad memory.

211
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:41,280
Qingyu, your parents care about you.

212
00:12:13,991 --> 00:12:17,130
(It's getting cold. Dress warm, baby.
It hurts me to see you like this.)

213
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:18,090
Qingyu,

214
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:19,450
is that guy outside the school gate

215
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:20,730
really your boyfriend?

216
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,160
Come on, you're a grown man.

217
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,480
Why are you drinking pink drinks?

218
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,610
It's sweet and cute. Don't you like it?

219
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:44,800
Here.

220
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,520
What flavor is it?

221
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,450
Pink and green together,

222
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:47,800
what a show.

223
00:12:48,425 --> 00:12:49,820
(Huanzhou High School)

224
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,760
What's going on?

225
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:55,400
Looks like trouble.

226
00:12:55,482 --> 00:12:57,440
(Huanzhou High School)

227
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,800
What happened?

228
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,160
What happened?

229
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:04,370
Of all the people to mess with,

230
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:05,610
why'd she go and mess with Hei?

231
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:06,800
He's a thug on the street.

232
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,210
Everyone knows how ruthless he is.

233
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,400
She's in for it now.

234
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,520
It's you!

235
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:45,880
Who else would it be?

236
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:51,040
Stop looking. It's just the two of us.

237
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,400
Weren't you going home? Let's go.

238
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,160
You live around here?

239
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,250
I've never seen you before.

240
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,330
I'm visiting Wang Mumu.

241
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,450
Ugh.

242
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,210
What kind of crappy place is this?

243
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:55,570
The water heater breaks every other day.

244
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:56,370
If you ask me,

245
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:57,920
we might as well just get a new one.

246
00:14:58,490 --> 00:14:59,850
Should we take it with us

247
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:01,680
when we move?

248
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:03,800
Mom and Dad work hard for money.

249
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,130
We should save when we can.

250
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:06,680
Stop spending like there's no tomorrow.

251
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,090
Qiao Jinyu.

252
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,160
Yeah?

253
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,040
Come here.

254
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,730
The other day, He Feihai told me

255
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,280
Qiao Beiyu ran away from home back then.

256
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,760
She ran from Nanqiao Village to Shunyun.

257
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:24,880
Did you know about this?

258
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,250
I...

259
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:31,760
Yeah, I knew.

260
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,490
How come I don't remember that?

261
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,000
Mom and Dad told me not to tell you.

262
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:41,160
I remember it was freezing that day.

263
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,850
The sky was gray.
It looked like snow but nothing fell.

264
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,250
I saw her on my way home.

265
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:07,400
Yu.

266
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:18,040
Dad, Mom.

267
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,920
I don't want to go back
to Nanqiao Village.

268
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,730
I don't want to take the entrance exam.

269
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,400
I want to stay in Shunyun
and be with you.

270
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:33,920
I can help out at the shop.

271
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,450
I won't cause any trouble.

272
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:39,370
You should at least finish high school.

273
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,160
Weren't you planning
to apply to a dance academy?

274
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,920
I don't want to study anymore.

275
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,210
As long as I can be with you,

276
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:48,370
I don't need to go to school.

277
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,130
Beiyu,

278
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:53,330
if you stop studying,

279
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,130
what are you going to do in the future?

280
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:57,640
Haven't you heard people say

281
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,730
college graduates are everywhere now?

282
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:03,450
And we can't even get you
a high school diploma.

283
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:05,240
If word gets out,

284
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,160
it'll be embarrassing.

285
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,370
I'm not afraid of that.

286
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:09,850
But I am.

287
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:23,200
Beiyu, you need to listen to me.

288
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:28,400
You have to finish school, alright?

289
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,010
I know you're upset right now.

290
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:32,290
I know that

291
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:35,440
you've grown up

292
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,610
on your own.

293
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,610
You've been through a lot.

294
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,240
But this is life.

295
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,770
Who doesn't go through tough times?

296
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,290
Right?

297
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:49,640
When life gets hard,

298
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,960
just grit your teeth and push through.

299
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,010
You'll get through it.

300
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:58,370
Think about it carefully.

301
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:00,480
You can't throw your life away.

302
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,090
Right?

303
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:05,920
Your mom's right.

304
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:09,160
Once you get into college,
things will be better.

305
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,570
Dad, Mom.

306
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:16,010
Why is no one watching the shop?

307
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:17,530
Coming!

308
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:50,620
(Math score)

309
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,090
After that,

310
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:28,720
it seemed like
she never tried to run away again.

311
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,330
She gave up running

312
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,880
because she knew no one would save her.

313
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,720
If back then...

314
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,720
Back then,

315
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,480
we were just kids.

316
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:40,290
Even if we knew,

317
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:41,400
what could we have done?

318
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:45,440
Where are you going?

319
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,920
I'm going to ask Mom and Dad

320
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,330
why they didn't help Qiao Beiyu.

321
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,770
Wait, no!

322
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:51,720
Don't say I told you.

323
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,770
(Qiao's Noodle Shop)

324
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,010
What are you doing?

325
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:55,090
Call the police now!

326
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:56,330
Hurry, call the cops!

327
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,530
Call the police!

328
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,160
Do it!

329
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,570
Bring your daughter Qingyu out here.

330
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:14,200
Hei, look...

331
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,960
She's just a kid. Can you let it go?

332
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,240
What are you saying?

333
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,130
Your daughter, Qiao Beiyu,

334
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:26,680
was sneaking around
with other guys behind my back.

335
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:28,530
She cheated on me.

336
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:30,920
She embarrassed me.

337
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:33,480
Don't you think she owes me?

338
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,640
If the sister owes me,
shouldn't the younger one pay it back?

339
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:39,400
That's only fair, right?

340
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,720
She has nothing to do with it.

341
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:45,610
You don't have garlic?

342
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:47,850
Garlic?

343
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:49,200
Yeah, we have some.

344
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,200
If the kid did something wrong,

345
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,880
then I'll apologize on her behalf.

346
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,530
But this really has nothing
to do with Qingyu.

347
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,400
What's with you?

348
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,850
Can you stop acting

349
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:07,400
like the world is ending?

350
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,200
I'm just dating your daughter,
that's all.

351
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,570
I'm not going to eat her alive.

352
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,810
Besides,

353
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:17,330
it was your Qiao Qingyu
who reached out to me first.

354
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:18,400
She made the first move.

355
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,330
No way.

356
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,130
You guys don't know?

357
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:24,440
Your daughter's been asking
around about Hei.

358
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,810
If that's not flirting, what is?

359
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:26,850
That's nonsense!

360
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:29,680
How about this?
Bring your daughter here

361
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,480
and ask her face-to-face.

362
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:34,370
Pretty spicy.

363
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:37,050
Come on.

364
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,640
What are you doing?

365
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,880
No, no, no!

366
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,050
We're sorry.

367
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:53,370
We're really sorry!

368
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:57,640
You're here.

369
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,400
The police are here.

370
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,810
It's okay, the cops are here.

371
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:03,240
Hei, are we going or not?

372
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:10,240
It's over, go home.

373
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,960
It's all fine now, go home.

374
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,530
Go home.

375
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,050
Qingyu.

376
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:37,240
A girl should be
extra cautious out there.

377
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:42,570
Stay away from those shady types.

378
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,010
Haven't I told you that?

379
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:49,160
They said

380
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:51,130
you went looking for them.

381
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:55,010
What were you thinking?

382
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,770
I just want to know

383
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,440
who really caused Qiao Beiyu's death.

384
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,570
She brought it on herself.
No one else is to blame.

385
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:07,920
That's not it.

386
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,850
She's gone now.

387
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:11,130
What more do you want?

388
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:12,770
If you keep digging like this,

389
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:14,280
everything's going to come out.

390
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,440
What's that going to do

391
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,680
to our family's reputation?

392
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:18,330
When Qiao Beiyu ran away

393
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,770
from Nanqiao Village to Shunyun,

394
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:21,370
is this what you told her too?

395
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:22,240
What are you saying?

396
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,960
It was freezing that day.

397
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:27,480
Qiao Beiyu ran all that way alone

398
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,640
to beg for your help.

399
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:31,130
And what did you do?

400
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,880
You knew she was
being bullied back in Nanqiao.

401
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,050
You knew full well
what kind of life she was living.

402
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,330
But you still refused to help.

403
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:39,570
What are you talking about?

404
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:42,200
I wanted to ask why you didn't help her,

405
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:44,400
but now I know the answer.

406
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,480
You were just too selfish.

407
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,520
You thought Beiyu's life

408
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,050
wasn't as important as your reputation.

409
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:51,770
Qing!

410
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:52,610
Get out of my way.

411
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:14,760
(Didn't it upset you)

412
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,130
(to hear what they said about you?)

413
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:16,880
(Qiao Beiyu,)

414
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,240
(was any of it true?)

415
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,010
(Are the rumors true?)

416
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:22,090
If you tell me it's not,
I'll believe you.

417
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:25,010
Say something, Qiao Beiyu.

418
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:25,810
Qiao Beiyu!

419
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,680
What if it's true?

420
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,720
If you don't want to end up like me,

421
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:37,610
then stay far away from me.

422
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:49,850
What?

423
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:53,610
I came to remind you that
it's your dad's birthday today.

424
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,680
How is that my concern?

425
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:00,440
It doesn't, but it's important to me.

426
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,570
Mr. Ming's been helping
my mom with her treatment.

427
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:05,570
So I wanted to take the chance

428
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:07,010
to thank him on his birthday.

429
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:10,850
I have rehearsal after school.

430
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:12,370
Pass my thanks to Mr. Ming.

431
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,160
Please.

432
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:19,290
If you're too busy or just unwilling,

433
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,570
throw it away.

434
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:23,640
Fine, I will. You think I won't?

435
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,160
Alert the blood bank right now.

436
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:41,130
Get four units of red blood cells ready.

437
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:42,480
Four hundred milliliters of plasma.

438
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,600
Ten units of cryoprecipitate.

439
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:47,200
Got it.

440
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,090
This leukemia patient is
in critical condition.

441
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:50,200
Ming Sheng?

442
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:53,960
We just got a severe case

443
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,090
that needs emergency surgery.

444
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,320
Wait for him in his office.

445
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,650
He'll come by right after surgery.

446
00:27:58,650 --> 00:27:59,840
Just wait there, don't leave.

447
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,660
(Standards
for Diagnosing HPB Conditions)

448
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,010
Hook up the patient to a heart monitor.

449
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:11,200
Keep an eye on vitals and urine output.

450
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:12,530
And remember,

451
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:14,240
this is a right liver lobe resection.

452
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,770
Make sure the family understands.

453
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:16,960
Got it, Dr. Ming.

454
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,570
Standard procedure. We won't mess it up.

455
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:22,130
You should get off work.

456
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:24,960
It's fine. I still need
to check in on the ICU.

457
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,400
You forgot what day it is?

458
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,010
Good evening, Dr. Ming.

459
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:30,680
Yeah.

460
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,440
What day?

461
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:37,680
It's your birthday. Did you forget?

462
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,850
Ming Sheng came by.

463
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,130
He even got you a cake.

464
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:44,290
He is waiting in your office.

465
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:45,200
Go on.

466
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:48,570
Go ahead.

467
00:30:22,708 --> 00:30:26,330
(Souvenirs Entomologiques)

468
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:52,200
It's gotten colder lately.

469
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,240
Your mom asked me
to pick up a thick blanket.

470
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:57,640
Life in the city is great in every way,

471
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:00,200
even the winters
are warmer than back home.

472
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:05,440
Oh, by the way, did you hear?

473
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,200
Aunt Qin has passed away.

474
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:11,810
What happened?

475
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:14,920
She never really recovered

476
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,720
after she got out of that fire.

477
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,200
She was in the hospital for a while.

478
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,600
Her injuries never got better,

479
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,240
but the money sure ran out quickly.

480
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:22,810
Your second uncle had no choice

481
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:25,160
but to bring her home from the hospital.

482
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,090
She hung in there a bit longer,

483
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:28,850
but she just couldn't hold on.

484
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,920
Honestly, death might've been
a relief for her.

485
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,090
She was beautiful and educated too.

486
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:40,160
It's just a shame her life was so hard.

487
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:42,530
She was a great person.

488
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:44,240
How did she end up in Nanqiao Village?

489
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,850
My mom said

490
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:48,720
Aunt Qin had a younger brother.

491
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,640
Her parents wanted him to get married,

492
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:54,090
so they gave away
their daughter for a bride price.

493
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,770
Now that I think about it,

494
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:59,370
if Aunt Qin hadn't
gone through all that,

495
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:01,370
maybe she'd still be alive.

496
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,810
And if Qiao Beiyu
hadn't been through so much,

497
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,090
maybe she'd still be here too.

498
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,370
Sorry about this.
We'll clean it up right away.

499
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:29,400
Sorry for the trouble.

500
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,800
We'll get it all sorted quickly.

501
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,610
(Slut. Disgrace. Shameless.)
Look at this mess.

502
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:34,480
Qiao Beiyu?

503
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:37,570
How many kids are in her family?

504
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:39,850
Wasn't one of them named Qiao...

505
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:40,920
Qingyu?

506
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:41,610
Right.

507
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:43,480
Yeah, two of them.

508
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:50,090
Oh no.

509
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:51,770
Oh my gosh.

510
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,850
Who would do something so awful?

511
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:55,810
Let me help you.

512
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:56,880
No, it's okay.

513
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,570
Thank you.

514
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,240
Class rep, here's mine. Sorry it's late.

515
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,370
Hand it in earlier next time.

516
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:21,610
We're still missing a few.

517
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:23,240
Who else hasn't
turned in their homework?

518
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:25,680
Where is she?

519
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:28,130
No idea. She was gone when I got here.

520
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:30,920
Probably hiding
because she didn't do it.

521
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,130
Ming Sheng, homework's due.

522
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:33,450
What are you doing here?

523
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,010
Class is starting.

524
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:50,610
I heard about what happened
at your family's noodle shop.

525
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,130
I thought it'd be something serious.

526
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:54,800
But it's no big deal.

527
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:57,280
So people are gossiping a bit, so what?

528
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,890
Huanzhou's such a big city,

529
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,530
crazy things happen every day.

530
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,720
They will forget it in a few days.

531
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,200
Do you think Qiao Beiyu

532
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,930
felt as miserable as I do now?

533
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,320
No.

534
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:17,200
She must've felt even worse.

535
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:21,240
A thousand times worse.
Ten thousand times.

536
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,410
To be honest,
I used to really hate Qiao Beiyu.

537
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:28,130
I thought she was dumb and weak.

538
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,890
Even in death,
she dragged our family down.

539
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:32,320
But now I get it.

540
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,200
Some wounds

541
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,800
never truly heal.

542
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,530
She was hurting too much.

543
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,610
She just couldn't take it anymore.

544
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:42,640
So, she chose to destroy herself

545
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,800
to escape reality.

546
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:47,200
But, I can't let it go.

547
00:35:48,514 --> 00:35:50,320
Why is it that she paid the price

548
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,360
for her own choices,

549
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,450
but the ones who hurt her

550
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:53,970
still get to live guilt-free?

551
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,530
Is there no justice in this world?

552
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:17,640
Can anyone solve this?

553
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,130
Alright, no worries.

554
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:20,840
Let's keep going with this question.

555
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,530
The absolute value of F1 times F2.

556
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:25,160
Okay, up to this step.

557
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,410
Anyone not following?

558
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,930
MF1 equals 2.

559
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:31,050
That's less than F1 times F2.

560
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:32,360
Which equals double.

561
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,240
You can tell just from this.

562
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,970
It's basically two parts.

563
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:37,320
Because this is zero.

564
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,970
Zero is our origin.

565
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:42,530
You there, no running in the hallway!

566
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:43,800
Got it, sir.

567
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,610
It takes an hour
to get to the sports arena by bus.

568
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:52,610
Why don't we just grab a cab?

569
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:53,970
Can you stop being so spoiled?

570
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,450
There're so many of us.
A taxi would cost a fortune.

571
00:36:56,450 --> 00:36:57,160
Besides,

572
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,050
we still have time
before the game starts.

573
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,890
(But I can't let it go.)

574
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:05,050
(She already paid the price)

575
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:06,410
(for her choices.)

576
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:07,410
(But those who hurt her)

577
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:09,010
(are still living guilt-free.)

578
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:10,840
The bus is here.

579
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,450
What's on your mind?

580
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:23,800
Take one each. Don't lose yours.

581
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,130
Tie it on your head later.

582
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,680
Did you all memorize the new cheer?

583
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,090
Yeah.

584
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:31,240
When I yell, "Ming Sheng, Ming Sheng,"

585
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,050
you all shout,

586
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:35,640
"Huanzhou High School will win!"

587
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,890
Yeah, we know.

588
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:39,010
You've had us practice
that like a million times.

589
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:41,930
It's the finals today.
Everything's on the line.

590
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,800
No one must mess this up.

591
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:45,160
Got it.

592
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,200
I heard No.1 High is strong this year.

593
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,720
They have a bunch of student athletes.

594
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:53,410
So what? As long as we have Ming Sheng,

595
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:54,840
the trophy is ours.

596
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,240
Of course.
That trophy has our name on it.

597
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:57,760
Exactly.

598
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,050
Yeah, totally.

599
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,010
Hey, who are you looking for?

600
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:05,320
Is Qiao Qingyu in your class?

601
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,610
Qiao Qingyu, someone's here for you.

602
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,760
It's not me.

603
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,130
It's her boyfriend.

604
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:14,090
He's waiting for her at the school gate.

605
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,360
Dad, Mom, have some tea.

606
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,240
Last time you talked to me and your dad,

607
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,320
you didn't say
you'd been dating for three years.

608
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,010
Three years and still not public?

609
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:28,600
What's Ming Qiuxin playing at?

610
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,970
That's practically messing around.

611
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:31,240
Oh, come on.

612
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,160
Both of them agreed.

613
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:35,240
How is that messing around?

614
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,130
Then, let me ask you,

615
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:38,970
when do you plan to get married?

616
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:43,160
Mom...

617
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,490
I don't want to get married right now.

618
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:49,010
Is it you or him?

619
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:53,360
Alright.

620
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:55,720
He's already agreed to meet the parents.

621
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:57,720
That is a show of sincerity.

622
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,280
When you meet Mr. Ming later,

623
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,490
don't pull a long face.

624
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:02,360
Or you'll scare off
even the best son-in-law.

625
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:03,410
Come on.

626
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:05,010
You think I don't know that?

627
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:07,160
I'm just voicing my concerns.

628
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:10,090
Alright. Let's have some tea.

629
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:15,970
Who's causing trouble?

630
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:17,490
Did anyone see us making trouble?

631
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:18,840
Listen up.

632
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,490
These are all students here.

633
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:22,760
They are not like people like you.

634
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,490
What's your problem?

635
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:25,530
How are we different?

636
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:26,360
Explain yourself.

637
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,280
Qiao Qingyu is here.

638
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,160
Qiao Qingyu.

639
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,840
Yeah, Qiao Qingyu. Hei's girlfriend.

640
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,640
Qingyu!

641
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:35,890
I went to your shop for noodles.

642
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:37,930
They are really good.

643
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,010
Why don't you all
come to eat at our shop too?

644
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:43,010
What do you really want?

645
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,320
I've made up my mind.

646
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:51,280
I want to date you.

647
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:51,970
Not interested.

648
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,530
If you don't listen to me,

649
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:55,160
I'll go mess with your family.
Believe it?

650
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,800
Your sister spent my money.

651
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,570
She owed me.

652
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:04,040
She's dead now.

653
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,010
The debts are on you now.

654
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,490
What about what you did to Qiao Beiyu?

655
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,010
So, you're jealous now?

656
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:15,840
Yeah, she is jealous of her sister.

657
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:16,930
It's fine.

658
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,760
You're not as pretty as your sister,

659
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,720
but I actually like that
fake prim look you have.

660
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,420
You have no idea
what your sister was like...

661
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,080
Shut your mouth!

662
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,130
I knew it.

663
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,890
You don't even know what she was like.

664
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,410
Especially after a few drinks.

665
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:29,360
She'd do whatever I told her to!

666
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:29,930
Let me go!

667
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:34,840
