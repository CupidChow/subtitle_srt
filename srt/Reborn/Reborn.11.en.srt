(Adapted from the serialized work "Reborn"
by Qiang Yu)

15
00:01:37,381 --> 00:01:39,000
We need to hurry up with the makeup.

16
00:01:39,031 --> 00:01:40,310
The ceremony is about to start.

17
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,110
Let's use the auspicious peach shade.

18
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:43,720
Sure.

19
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,500
Where are the wedding shoes?

20
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,750
Were they left in the car?

21
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,940
The car is parked
by the village entrance.

22
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,100
I'll take you there.

23
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,140
Just in case you get lost.

24
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:57,440
Sure.

00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,390
Qingyu,

26
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,160
um,

27
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,030
please help Xiaoyun

28
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:05,030
with her dress.

29
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,600
Can you help her put the pendant on?

30
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,460
I'll leave it here.

31
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,110
Thank you for helping me today.

32
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,670
Xiaoyun,

33
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,760
how did you meet Jinrui?

34
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,360
When I was in my senior year,

35
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,390
Jinrui invited me to act

36
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,360
in a short film.

37
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,830
He played the male lead,

38
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,590
and I played the female lead.

39
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,080
Funny enough,

40
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,960
we played a couple in that film.

41
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,080
I played a girl

42
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,360
who was really good at dancing.

43
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,040
After the shoot,

44
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,200
we grew closer,

45
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,710
and eventually,

46
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,200
we got together.

47
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:55,240
What was the film about?

48
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,390
It was a tragic love today.

49
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,990
The couple didn't end up together.

50
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,590
Maybe Jinrui thought it was a bad omen,

51
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,960
so he hid all the footage

52
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:08,800
and never wanted to watch it again.

53
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,080
But I think

54
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,640
the story and reality are different.

55
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,830
Look, we're doing great now, aren't we?

56
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,040
We're getting married.

57
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,240
I'm sorry.

58
00:03:21,289 --> 00:03:30,430
=Episode 11=
(A Broken Wedding)

59
00:03:35,511 --> 00:03:36,710
Have you seen Qingyu?

60
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,870
I saw her upstairs just now.

61
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,420
She was helping Xiaoyun with her makeup.

62
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:43,800
Leave it here.

63
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:44,710
Okay.

64
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:45,990
Is this better?

65
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:46,640
Yes.

66
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,590
Right.

67
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:57,270
I accidentally pricked my finger

68
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:58,960
and stained the wedding gown.

69
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,830
Are you okay, Qingyu?

70
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:00,430
I'm fine.

71
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:06,640
Never mind. I can wipe it off.

72
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,870
Stains on the gown can be wiped off.

73
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,520
But the stains on a person can't.

74
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:15,640
Yes?

75
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:19,230
Xiaoyun,

76
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:23,640
I hope you'll be happy.

77
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,320
I will.

78
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,590
Put yourself together.

79
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:52,320
Your dad

80
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:55,320
gave me this

81
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,560
when we got married.

82
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,790
It's the only decent thing he gave.

83
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:00,910
You're beside the bride today.

84
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,200
Clean up yourself nicely.

85
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,640
Wear it later.

86
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,590
Once Jinrui's wedding's over,

87
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,270
we'll head back to Huanzhou.

88
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,960
Leave those unhappy things behind.

89
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:15,350
You have to start living your own life.

90
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,150
Cheer up.

91
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:38,080
Jinrui.

92
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,640
Look who's here.

93
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,150
Jinrui.

94
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,270
It's been a long while.

95
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,270
Congratulations, Jinrui.

96
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:44,270
You and your wife are a perfect match.

97
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:45,350
Thank you.

98
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:47,960
Jinrui, you're finally putting
your single life behind you

99
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,590
and joining the whipped club.

100
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:51,000
Don't listen to him.

101
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,440
He's teasing you

102
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,760
because he can't find a wife.

103
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:55,470
Come on, take a seat.

104
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:56,790
I saved you two a spot there.

105
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:57,830
Okay. We'll head over.

106
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,270
Didn't you invite your other friends?

107
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:03,710
Xiaoyun's parents specifically asked us

108
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:04,590
to keep it low-key.

109
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,910
We're going on a honeymoon right after.

110
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,140
Feihai, come sit here.

111
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,000
I'll head over first.

112

Here, this is for you.

113
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,440
That's the last one.

114
00:06:21,236 --> 00:06:21,790
Qing,

115
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,520
can you get me another box
of wedding candy?

Mr. Zhang, you're here.
It's been a long while.

Take this instead.

129
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:14,860
Okay.

130
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:15,890
You're here.

131
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,010
Congratulations.

132
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,660
Thanks for coming all the way here

133
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,620
to the village.

134
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,620
I hope you can forgive me
for the poor hospitality.

135
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:22,540
Not at all.

This is my superior, Mr. Liu.

140

He's doing great at work.

141
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:35,130
He's driven and motivated.

142
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:37,180
You've taught him well.

143
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:37,890
You flattered me.

144
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,660
Mr. Liu really looks out for me at work.

145
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,570
Thank you so much.

146
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,890

Thank you, Mr. Liu.

150

You're welcome.

151
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,890
This young man is hard-working.

152

Thank you, Mr. Liu.

153

156
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:15,490
to show up today?

157
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,540
Yeah. What were they thinking?

158
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,780
Today's Jinrui's wedding.

159
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,930
I wouldn't have come if I were them.

160
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:24,580
They're just here to ruin the day.

161
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,420
Tell me about it.

162
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,540
Today's a big day.

163
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,140
Jinrui is too kind.

164
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,690
The Qiao family is so unfortunate

165
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:32,090
to have a daughter like her.

166
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:32,780
Yeah.

167
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:42,420
May all the children be prosperous.

168
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:44,090
Wonderful!

169
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:47,090
May the bride succeed in all she does.

170
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,660
Wonderful!

171
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,210
May your wealth grow.

172
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,020
Wonderful.

173
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:56,180
May the couple stay loving
and have a child by next year.

174
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,420
Did I beg them to raise my child?

175
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:01,610
They snatched my child from me.

176
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:04,140
First bow to Heaven and Earth.

177
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:08,850
Jiangsheng, have you seen Qingyu?

178
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:09,610
No.

179
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:12,570
Second bow to the parents.

180
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,500
Good!

181
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,420
Bow to each other.

Here.

184
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:24,780
Lift the bride's veil,

185
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:29,140
and a fair lady appears.

186
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,210
Beautiful!

187
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:32,500

(pin on a flower)

189
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,450
(and fight against the darkness.)

190
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,420
(To reveal the truth,)

191
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,850
(change your course)

192
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:42,210
(and be ready to ignite
into a burning tree.)

193
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:46,140
Kiss!

194
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,380
(A person truly dies)

195
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:50,450
(only when they are forgotten.)

196
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:53,900
(No matter how joyful a celebration is,)

197
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:57,060
(it can never cover up
monstrous crimes.)

198
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,330
Congratulations, Jinrui.

199
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:03,260
Congratulations, Jinrui.

200
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:04,970
I wish you a happy marriage.

201
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,450
Take good care of your bride.

202
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:22,580
What's written on it?

203
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,540
Hurry up and have kids.

204
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:23,930
Okay.

205
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,540
What are you reading?

206
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:41,690
(He's a shameless coward.)

207
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,850
(He's the man
who caused Beiyu's miscarriage)

208
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:44,970
(and betrayed her.)

209
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:48,020
(This isn't a story. It's a real
tragedy. The man of the day,)

210
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:49,730
(the groom,)

211
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:50,930
(Qiao Jinrui,)

212
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:55,180
(the proud eldest grandson
of the Qiao family,)

213
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:56,850
(was actually adopted.)

214
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:01,540
(They dumped all the blame on Beiyu)

215
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,860
(to cover up the truth,)

216
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,180
(keeping everyone in the dark.)

217
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,420
(Six years ago,)

218
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,540
(everyone here from Nanqiao Village)

219
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,690
(was complicit in a murder.)

220
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,330
(The victim wasn't allowed
to be buried in the ancestral tomb)

221
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:15,020
(nor even allowed a name.)

222
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,260
(Qiao Beiyu.)

223
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,850
(Was complicit in a murder.)

224
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:20,940
(Six years ago.)

225
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,330
(The victim wasn't allowed
to be buried in the ancestral tomb)

226
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:25,900
(nor even allowed a name.)

227
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,420
(The victim wasn't allowed
to be buried in the ancestral tomb)

228
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,060
(nor even allowed a name.)

229
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,500
(The victim wasn't allowed
to be buried in the ancestral tomb)

230
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,380
(nor even allowed a name.)

231
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:35,930
(Qiao Beiyu.)

232
00:11:49,091 --> 00:11:51,390
(A Sorrow We Must Never Forget)

233
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:54,500
Are you trying to ruin Jinrui?

234
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,090
Fine,

235
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:01,330
nobody's going to have it easy!

236
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:02,900
Yanfen, calm down.

237
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,570
What's done is done.

238
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:05,090
Calm down.

239
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:06,730
Right.

240
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:08,180
Qingyu's missing now.

241
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,810
We have to find her first.

242
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:11,900
For what?

243
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,690
She'd better be dead somewhere.

244
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,660
Jinrui.

245
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:23,450
Jinrui.

246
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:28,850
Jinrui, my poor boy!

247
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:34,420
They ruined it once,
and that's not enough.

248
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:38,140
They're pushing you to a dead end now.

249
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,970
Jinrui, poor thing.

250
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:43,210
Get up. The ground is cold.

251
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:48,930
What a sin.

252
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:50,570
Jinrui.

253
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:57,440
(Cousin)

254
00:13:01,268 --> 00:13:02,630
(Cousin)

255
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:13,310
(Cousin)

256
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,940
(All the money. The next train:
Huanzhou to Jiangmen.)

257
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,907
(Living expenses, one-bed, meals.)

258
00:13:32,922 --> 00:13:34,670
(Get a job within a month.)

259
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,300
The last train for tonight

260
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,850
was canceled because of the weather.

261
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:24,780
The earliest train tomorrow

262
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,970
leaves at 6:40 AM.

263
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:27,610
Then tomorrow morning it is.

264
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:28,100
Sure. 98.

265
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,500
Single bed with air conditioning.

266
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,820
It's right next to the station.

267
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:34,540
Thank you.

268
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:37,570
Do you need a room?

269
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:47,970
Do you need a room, miss?

270
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,060
Right next to the station.

271
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,380
Single bed with air conditioning.

272
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,460
The original price is 160.

273
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,180
But it's late now.

274
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,260
I'll give it to you for 80.

275
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,420
No, thanks.

276
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,730
How about 70, miss?

277
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:56,850
Do me a favor, please.

278
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:57,300
No.

279
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,180
You're a young girl.

280
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,980
It's not safe to stay
at the station overnight.

281
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,210
Excuse me.

282
00:16:58,450 --> 00:16:59,060
Excuse me.

283
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,420
My purse was stolen.

284
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,570
When did that happen?

285
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:02,450
How much was lost?

286
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:04,220
I was sleeping on that bench.

287
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,060
When I woke up, it was gone.

288
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,230
What's your name? How old are you?

289
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:08,880
I...

290
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,510
And your family's names, phone numbers,

291
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:12,360
and ID numbers.

292
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:14,360
I need to keep a record.

293
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,400
It's best to report this
to the local police station

294
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,400
and have it on record.

295
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,880
It's fine. Maybe it's a mistake.

296
00:18:00,641 --> 00:18:02,760
(Roasted Meat Fast Food Restaurant)

297
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,280
(Hiring dishwashers.
Meals and accommodation included.)

298
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,770
Ma'am.

299
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,250
What would you like to eat, miss?

300
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,680
I'm not here to eat.

301
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,010
Um... My purse was stolen
at the train station.

302
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:28,880
Can I borrow your handphone
to make a call?

303
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:34,920
Thank you.

304
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:43,570
The number you've dialed is powered off.

305
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:52,640
The number you've dialed is powered off.

306
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:54,840
No one's answering.

307
00:19:03,664 --> 00:19:05,570
(Menu: Plain noodles 6 yuan)

308
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,400
Can I get a bowl of plain noodles?

309
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:11,210
I only have five yuan.

310
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,160
You can give me less noodles.

311
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:36,400
I don't need an egg.
I can't pay for that.

312
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,920
It's fine. It's on the house.

313
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,450
Hurry and go home
after you finish eating.

314
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,120
The outside world is complicated.

315
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,770
You can't tell with people

316
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:55,160
whether they're good or bad.

317
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,450
A young girl out this late

318
00:19:58,050 --> 00:19:59,360
is very dangerous.

319
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:13,250
Eat up and go home.

320
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,600
Your family must be worried sick.

321
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:17,160
No place is better than home, right?

322
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:18,530
Ma'am.

323
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:22,570
Can I work here for a couple of days?

324
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,120
I can wash, chop, prepare ingredients,

325
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,080
and cook noodles.

326
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,530
My family runs a noodle house.

327
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,730
I was supposed to go to work
in Jiangzhou,

328
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:32,640
but my ID card and purse were stolen.

329
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,290
Once I gather enough money
for my ticket,

330
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,050
food, and phone calls, I'll go.

331
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:43,080
Well, then.
You may stay and give it a try.

332
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:43,920
Thank you.

333
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:23,840
Hello, where to?

334
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,640
Sir,

335
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,810
to Nanqiao Village in Shunyun.

336
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:28,810
What? From here to Shunyun?

337
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:29,450
Right.

338
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,320
That's over 200 kilometers per trip.

339
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,730
Please hurry, I'm in a rush.

340
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:33,250
Okay.

341
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:16,010
Young girl, hurry up.

342
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,120
Young girl, are you not feeling well?

343
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,570
I'm fine.

344
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:33,290
Um, you can take the money out
of my wages.

345
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:33,850
Young girl,

346
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:35,730
it's not that I don't want to keep you.

347
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,570
Look at your hands.

348
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:38,770
They're soft and fair.

349
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:40,920
They aren't for washing dishes.

350
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:42,880
They're for holding pens.

351
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:44,920
Also, this place isn't
where you should be.

352
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,490
Staying at home is more comfortable.

353
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,050
Take my advice

354
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:47,920
and go home.

355
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,210
Don't make your family worry.

356
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:51,360
Ma'am, please give me another chance.

357
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,880
I'll get better with practice.

358
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,010
My family won't worry about me.

359
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:57,600
They'd rather hate me.

360
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,680
All right, then. Be careful.

361
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:27,450
(Did you send that letter?)

362
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,800
(Sheng: Are you okay?)

363
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,280
(Where are you?)

364
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,157
(Reply as soon as you get this.)

365
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:49,170
(Missed calls)

366
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,226
Hello?

367
00:23:56,186 --> 00:23:57,986
This number called me

368
00:23:57,986 --> 00:23:59,706
around 3 AM.

369
00:24:00,226 --> 00:24:01,516
May I know who this is?

370
00:24:07,876 --> 00:24:08,596
Sir,

371
00:24:08,596 --> 00:24:09,986
we're not going to Nanqiao Village.

372
00:24:09,996 --> 00:24:11,756
Please take me
to the Huanzhou Train Station.

373
00:24:53,748 --> 00:24:55,396
(Bus Drop-off, Bus Pick-up)

374
00:25:05,636 --> 00:25:06,516
Excuse me.

375
00:25:06,746 --> 00:25:07,146
Excuse me.

376
00:25:07,692 --> 00:25:09,666
(Missing Person)
Have you seen this girl?

377
00:25:10,036 --> 00:25:11,986
She's around this tall.

378
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:13,510
Sir.

379
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:14,270
Yes.

380
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:15,720
Have you seen this girl?

381
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,590
Take a look, please. Have you seen her?

382
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,160
Have you seen this girl?

383
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,790
I'll leave you this.

384
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:23,230
If you see her,

385
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,480
please call me.

386
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,120
Okay.

387
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:25,880
Thank you.

388
00:25:25,918 --> 00:25:28,380
(Missing Person)

389
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:29,550
How's it going?

390
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,480
Over there.

391
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,590
There's a service desk. We can ask.

392
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,400
Here.

393
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,790
Look. Is that her?

394
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:05,400
Is this what you want?

395
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:07,200
Working at an eatery off the books?

396
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,720
What's wrong?

397
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,200
Are you sick?

398
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:20,960
I'd rather die here

399
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,230
than go back.

400
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,750
Qingyu, even if you hate them,

401
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,400
you shouldn't have done that.

402
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,550
You've hurt everyone in your family.

403
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,400
Let's go. I'll take you home.

404
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,510
I'm not going back.

405
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,270
You are.

406
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:34,960
Your family is...

407
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,160
I said I'm not going back.

408
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:39,990
Don't call my mom.

409
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:41,400
Can you stop all this nonsense?

410
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:44,030
Your dad rushed to Huanzhou overnight
last night.

411
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,200
He's been looking for you
at the bus and train stations.

412
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,920
Your grandpa and second uncle all came.

413
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,600
They're scared
something happened to you.

414
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,750
Are they?

415
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,920
They just want to drag me back
and question me.

416
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:55,680
Feihai,

417
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,590
you saw the note

418
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:58,720
in the wedding candy box.

419
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,270
You know

420
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:01,550
what Beiyu went through.

421
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,640
Don't you feel bad for her?

422
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:16,990
But you're sick now.

423
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,440
Your grandma fainted

424
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,480
at the wedding.

425
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,440
She's in the hospital.

426
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,510
Shouldn't you go back...

427
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:22,880
I'm not changing my mind.

428
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,990
And you don't avoid my question.

429
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,960
Jinrui hurt my sister

430
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,070
when she was in university.

431
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,920
Don't you feel bad for Beiyu?

432
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,270
Jinrui and his family
ruined Beiyu's youth

433
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,070
and her entire life.

434
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:41,200
Don't you hate them even a little?

435
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:48,200
Everyone makes mistakes.

436
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,510
The reality is

437
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:53,120
that Beiyu has gone.

438
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,550
Even if I hate them, would that help?

439
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,120
At least I won't do
anything reckless like you.

440
00:27:59,200 --> 00:27:59,990
Qingyu,

441
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,480
this whole thing is out of control now.

442
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:05,880
Your family's years of reputation

443
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,550
is ruined in one night.

444
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:08,880
You pulled so many innocent people

445
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,310
down with you,

446
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:10,880
do you know?

447
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,440
No one is innocent.

448
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:15,720
My grandpa, grandma, uncle, aunt,

449
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,920
and my parents,

450
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,160
are all covering up for Jinrui.

451
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,920
They lie

452
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,030
and slander Beiyu.

453
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:24,920
They're all accomplices.

454
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:31,920
Over the past year,

455
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:34,720
I really hated Qiao Beiyu.

456
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:37,960
I thought she ruined the whole family,

457
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:39,790
messed up our lives,

458
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:42,510
and was the reason

459
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:43,830
we were all suffering.

460
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,750
It wasn't until I found out
what Jinrui had done

461
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:51,030
that I finally realized

462
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:55,160
it wasn't Beiyu who ruined our lives.

463
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:01,030
They were the ones
who pushed her to the edge.

464
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:06,440
Beiyu used to be cheerful.

465
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:08,360
Honestly,

466
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,960
no one could tell
what she'd gone through.

467
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,230
That's because she kept it all inside.

468
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:18,800
Do you remember

469
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,360
what she wrote about you in her diary?

470
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,270
She...

471
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:27,590
Did she resent me

472
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,030
for being a coward,

473
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:32,070
for not standing up for her

474
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,590
when she was being bullied?

475
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,320
It was the complete opposite.

476
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,960
In her diary,

477
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,310
she wrote what you did for her.

478
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:43,590
Beiyu.

479
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:46,230
It was the only warmth she'd felt
in the past few years.

480
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,790
Now that she's gone,

481
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:10,510
we still say such horrible things
about her

482
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,120
and go on with life

483
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,400
like nothing ever happened.

484
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:19,480
It shouldn't be like this.

485
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,990
I don't regret clarifying the truth
for Qiao Beiyu.

486
00:30:29,967 --> 00:30:31,120
Qingyu.

487
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,920
Qingyu.

488
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,200
Qingyu!

489
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,590
Qingyu!

490
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,160
You're still sick. Stop being stubborn.

491
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,640
(The widespread rain and show)

492
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,280
(were caused by the La Niña phenomenon,)

493
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,520
(which triggered abnormal
atmospheric circulation.)

494
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,230
(Since January,
the persistent circulation)

495
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:02,030
(has caused frequent cold waves.)

496
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:04,360
(Reportedly, more than twenty provinces)

497
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,750
(have been continuously affected.)

498
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,230
Beiyu,

499
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:23,070
I stood up for you.

500
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,360
But why instead of feeling relieved,

501
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,960
the weight on me only grows.

37.5 degree. Low fever.

523
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:42,710
Qiao Dadan,

524
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:44,320
keep an eye on yourself
when you get home.

525
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,390
If the fever comes back,
make sure to take some meds.

526
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,300
Qiao Dadan?
[*Dadan means bold in Chinese]

527
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:54,440
Well, I know you don't want
your family to find you,

528
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:56,480
so I gave you a fake name.

529
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:58,480
It fits you, Qiao the Bold.

530
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,760
Weren't you overseas?

531
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,990
When did you come back?

532
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,880
Didn't I tell you?

533
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,990
I'll always stand by your side.

534
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,360
What happened?

535
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,590
A crash on the highway.

536
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,150
It was a wedding car.

537
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,400
The car was full of roses.

538
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:51,840
I heard the bride and groom
were badly injured.

539
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,880
It was terrible.

540
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:56,240
A car accident on their wedding day?

541
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,110
Tell me about it.

542
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:58,880
Let's hope they're fine.

543
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,070
Excuse me.

544
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,320
Nurse!

545
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,670
Come on and help.

546
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,400
What's wrong?

547
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,920
She suddenly fainted.

548
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:09,240
Give us a hand.

549
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,630
What happened?

550
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,670
She fainted.

551
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,150
It happened so suddenly.

552
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,150
Put her down.

553
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:19,800
Ma'am.

554
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:30,190
Am I doing this wrong?

555
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,760
I don't think so.

556
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,240
Then why

557
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,920
do I feel so scared

558
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:40,510
even though I've done something right?

559
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,070
Didn't you say
you weren't afraid of anything?

560
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:52,240
I used to think that too.

561
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,960
But after everything happened,

562
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,400
I realized I'm actually a coward.

563
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:00,400
I couldn't even go to the wedding.

564
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,280
I'm scared of
what Grandpa and Uncle Haisheng

565
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,400
will do to my parents.

566
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,760
And what if

567
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,190
the patients in the operating room

568
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,110
are Jinrui and Xiaoyun?

569
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,030
Don't overthink it.

570
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:19,680
Just focus on getting well.

571
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,800
That's all you need to do.

572
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,550
Can you lend me some money?

573
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:35,990
It's pointless asking for that now.

574
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,280
You can't go anywhere

575
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,320
even if you go out now.

576
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:42,990
Your parents

577
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:44,880
have posted a missing person ad
in the newspaper.

578
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:47,320
You're in the news now.

579
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:53,360
Don't worry about that.

580
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,030
Just lend me some money.

581
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:56,560
How could I not worry?

582
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,920
Did I come all the way back here

583
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,030
just to watch the mess?

584
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,030
There's a place I know

585
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:09,190
your family will never think to look.

586
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,030
Let's go.

587
00:39:27,773 --> 00:39:36,690
(Ms. Ma's General Store)

588
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:47,110
Ms. Ma.

589
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,240
The goods are here.

590
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,550
You're early today.

591
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:51,590
No choice.

592
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,400
Come on. Unload them.

593
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,920
Are you still cold?

594
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,400
There.

595
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:16,670
It's injured.

596
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:17,920
Hmm.

597
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,960
This cage is left by my grandpa.

598
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:42,400
I didn't think
I'd actually need it one day.

599
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,840
Your family's

600
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,190
looking for you all over Huanzhou.

601
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,590
They'll never guess

602
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:51,400
you're hiding right under their noses.

603
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:52,880
You see,

604
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,070
the most dangerous place

605
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,710
is actually the safest.

606
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,400
It's cold outside.

607
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,710
Do you want to take a hot shower

608
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:09,590
to warm yourself up?

609
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,030
I didn't bring any clothes.

610
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,070
It's fine. You can wear mine.

611
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:18,030
They're all washed.

612
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,240
Very clean.

613
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:20,510
Don't worry.

614
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,920
