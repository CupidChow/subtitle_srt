33
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:29,330

34
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:30,520
Didn't we already pay 80,000

35
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,610
for the transfer fee in full?

36
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,450

I'm so sorry, mister. Sorry.

40
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:39,200
Please cut us some slack.

41
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,400

Hello, feel free to try
Qiao's Handmade Noodle House.

78
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:04,770
It doesn't look like a proper opening.

79
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,330
There are only two firecrackers.

80
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:07,800
Do people even know what we're doing?

81
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,570
When we opened in our hometown,

82
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,330
you at least prepared flower baskets.

83
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:13,090
Now, you didn't prepare anything.

84
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:15,090
And everything's in a mess.

85
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:15,890
I don't get it.

86
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:17,810
Why do you have to choose today?

87
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,720
Didn't I explain to you?

88
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,920
We picked this date.

89
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,720
Today is a good day
to start the business.

90
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:27,920
Fine, I guess so.

91
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,960
This tiny little shop

92
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,880
actually costs 80,000
for the transfer fee.

93
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,010
Aside from that,

94
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,440
there's also a property management fee.
I've never heard of it.

95
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,890
You know what?

96
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:41,400
I bought green veggies this morning.

97
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:43,040
It costs 0.4 yuan more per jin.

98
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,360
I bought it in our hometown
for less than 0.4 yuan per jin.

99
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,240
Why didn't you mention

100
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,360
we could sell a few more yuan
for each bowl of noodles?

101
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,520
Who do we sell the noodles to?

102
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,400
There's no one around.

103
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:52,840
What happened?

104
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:55,010
Mom.

105
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:57,570
Did you get hurt?

106
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,330

108
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,840
Well.

109
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,400
You two go hand out flyers.

110
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,450
I'll clean up here.

111
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,090
All right. Go on.

112
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:09,280
Be careful.

113
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,360
I'll do it. Give it to me.

00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,400

118
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,440
You just run off
without telling anymore.

119
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,360
Can't you be more like your sister
and help out?

120
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,040
We've got so much to deal with
at the shop.

121
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,250
I haven't paid the money yet.

122

00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:35,320
today's the first day
of our noodle house.

124
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,570
We haven't made any profits yet.

125
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,960
How about this?

126
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,810
I'll bring you a bowl of noodles.

127
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:41,690
Is that your shop?

128
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:42,250
Yes.

129
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,090
No worries.

130
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:44,650
We're neighbors.

131
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,210
We'll pay you back tomorrow.

132
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:47,400
It's all right.

Two.

138
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,480
She's the eldest one, right?

139
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:59,240
One boy, one girl. That's good.

140
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,000
You'll have a comfortable life
in the future.

141
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,520

150
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,250
You splashed dirty water into my bowl.

151

I didn't.

155
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:28,160
What did you just say?

159
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,210

160

00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,570
Don't go.

You're a service person.

164
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,560
What's with your attitude?

165
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:40,130
He said I'm blind.

166
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:40,400
Sorry.

167
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,600

Please calm down.

Why are you so careless?

175
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,130
He was using a cloth

176
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,000
and splashed dirty water
into my noodles.

00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:36,330
We'll always end up on the downside.

190
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,760
Are you okay?

191
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,120
Well, I'll give you a day off.

192
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,330
Go and rest.

193
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:41,600
Go.

194
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:47,600
I thought it'd be a good start
if we were nice.

195
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,120
She has a bad temper.

196
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,690
Had you stepped out earlier,

197
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:53,170
his hand wouldn't have been burned.

198
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,210
There's no one I can rely on
in this family.

199
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:55,800
Order, please.

200
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:56,690
Coming.

201
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,330
Isn't it inappropriate

202
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,120
for a man

203
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,810
to meddle in a catfight?

204
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:09,720
Let me.

205
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:16,120
Qingyu, you're always the sweetheart.

206
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,360
The most sensible child.

207
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,960
Sir, an extra egg, please.

208
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:19,930
Coming.

209
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,570
I'll do it.

210
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,330
Hey, don't.

211
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:24,810
Be careful.

212
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:00,930
Look at this.

213
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,760
I bought it at the morning market.

214
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:05,690
"May everything go well."

215
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:06,600
Not bad, right?

216
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,880
That's a good blessing.

217
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,840
But

218
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,930
you've brought

219
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:16,080
too many useless things here.

220
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,640
Look at these.

221
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,360
Everything I brought here is useful.
They are worth a million, you know?

222
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,240
We have to be careful with our spending.

223
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,450
There'll be plenty to spend on later.

224
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:26,000
Mom,

225
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,880
I don't want to share a room
with Qingyu.

226
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,360
Sleep on the streets, then.

227
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:29,810
Exactly.

228
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,170
Mom, where's my gaming console?

229
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:43,000
All you do is play.

230
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,760
I don't like this place.

231
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,210
Why did we have to move here?

232
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:49,000
Why do you think?

233
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,600
It's all because of you two.

234
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:53,240
This place has
a better learning environment.

235
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,650
(Classmate Record,
Shunyun No. 1 High School, Qiao Qingyu)

236
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:23,840
Have you straightened everything up?

237
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:26,090
Mom.

238
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,000
How do you fold this blanket?

239
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,210
What are you even capable of?

240
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,410
Let me see.

241
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,570
Find the corner.

242
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:36,050
Look at your sister.

243
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:38,810
She's sensible and good at studies.

244
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,320
Huanzhou High School accepted her

245
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,160
right after they saw
her academic transcript.

246
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:44,240
And look at you.

247
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,400
It's so hard for you
to get admitted to a sports school.

248
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:47,720
Yes, right.

249
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,810
Qingyu excels in everything.

250
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:51,570
Then why did you give birth to me?

251
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:53,480
That was a mistake?
How could you say that?

252
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,290
Mom,

253
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:55,330
hurry and rest up.

254
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:56,880
We'll take care of this ourselves.

255
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:58,050
Did you hear that?

256
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:59,000
Do it yourself.

257
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,530
You're sensible and intelligent,

258
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:13,050
but so what?

259
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:15,760
Look at me. I'm free and easy.

260
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:19,090
Qingyu, I did you a favor just now.

261
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:22,000
You should treat me to a good meal.

262
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,530
In your dreams.

263
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,120
Is this how you repay your life savior?

264
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,760
Dad and Mom are already stressed enough.

265
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,090
You want me to be like you

266
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:30,090
and irritate them again?

267
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,690
Yes, you're sensible,

268
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,840
but they've never given you any rewards.

269
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,600
On the contrary,
I've been slouching every day.

270
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,170
They care more about me.

271
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,720
Dad and Mom pay
the least attention to you.

272
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:45,090
To be frank,

273
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,810
you're kind of invisible.

274
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:49,760
Back in Shunyun,

275
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,690
many people thought
I only had one sister,

276
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:53,480
and it wasn't you.

277
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,210
You're asking for another beating?

278
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:59,120
I'm telling the truth.

279
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,050
All right, all right.

280
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:03,530
You're my only sister.

281
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,290
You're my sister forever.

282
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:07,090
Is that okay?

283
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:08,240
Talk to the hand.

284
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:16,570
(Classmate Record,
Shunyun No. 1 High School, Qiao Qingyu)

285
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,189
(Ma Mingkai: Qiao Qingyu, it's a regret
I didn't get to say goodbye.)

286
00:15:30,192 --> 00:15:32,360
(May you always carry a smile,
hope, and love with you.)

287
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:33,930
Qingyu,

288
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:36,330
it's only the first day of the business,

289
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,960
and my hand almost got burned off.

290
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,480
Is Huanzhou really as great as Mom says?

291
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,210
Qingyu.

292
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:46,960
What?

293
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:50,360
It's not easy to run a business
in a big city.

294
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,360
Mom said this.

295
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,450
Why do you always believe
whatever she says?

296
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,120
I know

297
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,330
you don't want to come to Huanzhou.

298
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:00,170
You were doing so well
in your old school

299
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,000
and might've been recommended
for university admission.

300
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,320
Now that you've come to Huanzhou,

301
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:06,480
your situation has been overturned.

302
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,570
I doubt you're fine with that.

303
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,880
There are more opportunities
in Huanzhou High School.

304
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,570
Perhaps I might

305
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,290
get into a better university
in the future.

306
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,930
Besides, since we've come
to a new place,

307
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:17,840
a new environment,

308
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:19,570
things will happen for us.

309
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:37,360
The nerve of you!

310
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,050
Stand still. Don't run!

311
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:45,960
Get out of my way.

312
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,000
You're not getting away.

313
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,760
What are you doing?

314
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:50,720
Run as you want.

315
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:52,290
Keep running.

316
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,600
Don't move.

317
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,840
Take out your wallet.

318
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,050
I don't have it with me.

319
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,050
Where's your money?

320
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,600
Money.

321
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:27,920
(Ma Mingkai, I hope
this letter finds you well.)

322
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,160
(Everything's fine here in Huanzhou.)

323
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:32,400
(Right now, I'm writing this)

324
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,840
(under a banyan tree by the river.)

325
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,880
(Shunyun and Huanzhou are
only a hundred miles apart)

326
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:38,640
(but they're so much different.)

327
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,360
(You wrote in the classmate record)

328
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,730
(that you regretted
not saying a proper goodbye to me.)

329
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:47,360
(Perhaps separation is part of life.)

330
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,360
(But as written in novels,)

331
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,490
("No matter how far we are apart,)

332
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:55,970
(we're still under the same sky.)

333
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,810
(No matter where we are,)

334
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,810
(we don't feel lonely.")

335
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,640
(I hope you study hard)

336
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,600
(and pass NCEE with flying colors.)
[*National College Entrance Examination]

337
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,810
(Hopefully, we get into
the same university.)

338
00:18:23,614 --> 00:18:25,810
(To Ma Mingkai, From Qiao Qingyu)

339
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,440
Eh?

340
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:39,330
You took my leave.

341
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:42,050
Get out of my way.

342
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:46,290
This isn't yours.

343
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:49,730
This tree is mine.

344
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:55,480
Bayan tree

345
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,800
(Ficus altissima Blume)
belongs to

346
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,770
Huanzhou Municipal Forest and Parks Bureau.

347
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,530
When I say it's mine, it's mine.

348
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,730
On your letter here,

349
00:19:02,954 --> 00:19:04,010
It writes Qiao Qingyu.

350
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:06,640
This name sounds familiar.

351
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,970
If you like it, you can have it.

352
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:12,080
I can always write another.

353
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,530
You've got guts.

354
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:16,330
Do you know who I am?

355
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:19,530
You don't know me, anyway.

356
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,440
I know you.

357
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:25,920
Beiyu's

358
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,880
younger sister.

359
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:35,640
Are you?

360
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:49,360
Two, two, three, four,

361
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:51,920
five, six, seven.

362
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:08,200
Qiao Qingyu, let's go.

363
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:18,074
(Ms. Ma's General Store)

364
00:20:18,112 --> 00:20:20,050
Wang rented out his rooftop unit.

365
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:21,400
He got it rented?

366
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:22,770
Then how come ours hasn't?

367
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:24,040
You're not putting in any effort.

368
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:24,720
Tell me about it.

369
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:33,360
Hands off. Mom hasn't had her meat yet.

370
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,970
I'm not eating.

371
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,200
I eat it every day in the shop.

372
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,880
One of you is always bouncing around,

373
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,920
and the other one's worn out studying.

374
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:46,530
Qingyu,

375
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:48,160
study harder.

376
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,360
This isn't like Shunyun.

377
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:51,200
You used to be in the top ten there,

378
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,360
but you're only
slightly above average here,

379
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,050
right?

380
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:55,120
You might not stand out.

381
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,250
People say students at your new school
are ace students.

382
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,970
They all strive hard to study.

383
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:02,120
I've given up on him.

384
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,600
He's never the study type.

385
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:06,770
If you can get a diploma certificate,

386
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:08,050
that's the best I could ask for.

387
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:11,600
So I'm counting on you

388
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,970
to make our family proud, right?

389
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:15,840
You're home.

390
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,810
Yeah.

391
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:18,120
Have you eaten?

392
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:19,160
I have.

393
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:22,680
There weren't any customers
before eight.

394
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,840
I was waiting, but no one came.

395
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:26,600
So I had dinner there.

396
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,730
Don't be impatient.

397
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,810
We take time to build our business.

398
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:31,120
We just opened, after all.

399
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:33,250
I brought your meds.

400
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:33,970
Take them on time.

401
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:34,440
All right.

402
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,970
Don't let your injuries act up again.

403
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:37,600
I know.

(Adolescent Sexual Health

408
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:34,090
Qingyu,

409
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,600
you're a grown-up girl.

410
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:41,400
As a girl at school,

411
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:44,360
you need to be careful
with what you do and say.

412
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,490
Stay away from
those who don't study well

413
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:48,530
or troublemakers.

414
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:50,730
Your safety comes first.

415
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,640
If it were just your dad and me,

416
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,920
we could live anywhere.

417
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,090
We went through all the hassle

418
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:01,490
just for the sake of you two.

419
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,730
We want to give you a better environment

420
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,200
in which you can focus on your studies.

421
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,160
What's wrong with you?

422
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,770
You can't even handle
such a simple thing.

423
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,600
Let me see.

424
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:19,970
Is it deep?

425
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:51,640
Why keep them?

426
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:55,810
Those were her last pair of shoes.

427
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:58,530
The last keepsake from her.

428
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:00,200
She looked so beautiful dancing on stage

429
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,810
in those shoes.

430
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:03,920
Everyone in Shunyun

431
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,250
knows Qiao Beiyu.

432
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:08,730
Mom said

433
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:09,840
once we moved to Huanzhou,

434
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,640
there was no such person
in the family anymore.

435
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:14,530
There you go again, "Mom said".

436
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:16,400
I just thought

437
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:18,680
she was our sister.

438
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,570
She is not.

439
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,240
Tch.

440
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,200
What's with that scoff?

441
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:25,250
Whatever you truly think,

442
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:27,200
you only repeat everything Mom says.

443
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:28,680
Qiao Jinyu!

444
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:32,050
Well,

445
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,090
I mean,

446
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,570
you're the first child,
and I'm the second child.

447
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:40,050
Anyway, not many people here know us.

448
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,290
You don't know me, anyway.

449
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:53,490
I know you.

450
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,570
Beiyu's

451
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:57,400
younger sister.

452
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,880
(Isn't this Beiyu's younger sister?)

453
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,810
(Stay, sister.)

454
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:27,440
(Oh, nice.)

455
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,840
(- You're pretty.
- I don't know you.)

456
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,680
(But we know you.)

457
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,490
Where are you going, sister?

458
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,680
Hey, don't go.

459
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:34,920
Go away.

Meixi, wait for me.

463
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,530
Where did you go for the holidays?

464
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:26,680
My dad took me to Hong Kong, China,
for a concert.

465
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,120
Lucky you.

466
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,010
I wish I could go to a concert too.

467
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:43,600
A demerit point isn't that bad.

468
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,920
Once or twice is fine.

469
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:46,640
The real issue is his dad.

470
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,090
His dad's such a pain.

Why do you think

472
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,680
Sun picked us two

473
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,160
to post Sheng's demerit notice?

480
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,050
we're getting a transfer student today.

481

I'm Qiao Qingyu. Just transferred
into Class 5, Year 11.

483
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:15,250
So it is you.

484
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,160
What a fate.

485
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,290
Let me introduce myself. I'm Ye Zilin.

487
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,200
Nice to meet you.

488
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:26,090
Our class is cleaning the natatorium
this morning.

489
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:27,330
How about this?

490
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:28,880
We'll take you there now.

491
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,360
You don't have to go to the classroom.

492
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,250
Yeah. No one's in the classroom now.

493
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,810

Let's go.

495
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:34,920
Come.

496
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,400
Come. Let's go.

497
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,160
This way.

498
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,250

500
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,970
to clean the natatorium this early?

501

Stop complaining.

00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,160
see those coiled lane lines?

00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:05,490
Go and fix them.

506

00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,920
Here. Take this.

509
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,490
It's almost time for study hall.

510
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:32,760
Why hasn't anyone shown up yet?

511
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,000
Don't tell me we're cleaning
this whole place by ourselves.

512
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,770
Tell me about it.

513
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,330
This bunch doesn't contribute
to the class at all.

514
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,050
Hey.

515
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:43,290
Why did she fall into the pool?

516
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:44,360
Help her!

517
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:48,330

518

00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:51,200
Grab this.

Was it you, Ye Zilin?

521
00:28:59,010 --> 00:28:59,730
Not me.

522
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:01,010
I didn't know how she fell in.

523
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:01,810
Was it you?

524
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,360
I didn't see anything.

525
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,440

Qiao Qingyu just transferred here

Although there was
an accident at the start,

532
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,330
I believe in the days to come,

533
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:50,330
Qingyu will definitely feel

534
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,840
the fiery passion

535
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,400
of our class.

536
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,330
What's wrong with you guys?

537
00:29:57,770 --> 00:30:00,120
Do you want to take home
a few more papers

538
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,330
to fuel your passion?

539
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:06,330
All right.

540
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,010
Qiao Qingyu,

541
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:11,050
you'll sit next to Jiang Nian.

542
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:13,200
If you have any questions, ask Liu Jia.

543
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,290
She's the class monitor.

544
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,520
All right. Turn to

00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:24,200
Thank you for lending me your uniform.

You're welcome.

548
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:30,330
My mom's also from Shunyun.

549
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:32,160
So we're kind of from the same hometown.

550
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:52,400
How come she fell into the pool?

551
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,120
Who's in the water?

552
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:06,640
What are you standing here for?
Save her!

00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,920
Hurry up.

556
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,920
Here are some tips for you.

557
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,600
Keep your distance from them.

558
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,440
The two of them

559
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,440
are infamous slackers in our year.

560
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,680
Ye Zilin, a transient student.

561
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,330
No matter how poorly he scores on NCEE,

562
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:54,400
he'll inherit his family's shoe factory.

563
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:56,810
Chen Hao is a sports student.

564
00:31:56,810 --> 00:31:58,160
A long jumper.

565
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,440
He's already pre-admitted to
Huanzhou Sport University.

566
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,570
They may be terrible in their studies,

567
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:04,600
but they're best
when it comes to pranks.

568
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:06,680
As for Ming Sheng...

569
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,440
Beiyu's younger sister.

570
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,200
You've got the wrong person.

(Proper ways to protect yourself
from harassment)

572
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:34,490
When sexual harassment or assaults

573
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:35,530
happen,

574
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:38,400
dealing with it wisely and bravely

575
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,400
can help stop it.

576
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:43,440
Never be weak or helpless.

577
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,920
For example, shout for help,

578
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,090
distract the perpetrator,

579
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:50,250
or signal those nearby.

580
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:52,400
These are the correct ways
to deal with the situation.

581
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,440
As for high schoolers like you,

582
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,840
especially girls,

583
00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:01,640
where does harassment
most commonly happen?

584
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,290

585
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,600
please stand up and answer.

589
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,330
Qiao Qingyu,

590
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:42,010
where does harassment commonly happen?

591
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,880
Ma'am, I know why

592
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,160
she can't answer your question.

593
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:53,490
Qiao Qingyu,

594
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:55,400
why is it all blacked out?

595
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,400
Were you highlighting the main points?

596
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,570
I can't read them.

597
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:00,680
Ye, what's wrong with you?

598
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,560
You shouldn't touch girls' things
without asking.

599
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,530
You're disrespecting her.

600
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:04,010
Ma'am.

601
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,490
I'm so sorry.

602
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:08,240
That being said, Qiao Qingyu,

603
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,530
you're too upright.

604
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,120
Are you from ancient times?

605
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,090
Please behave.

606
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:17,090
For a long time,

607
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:19,280
a lack of knowledge
about reproductive health

608
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,930
has made it a sensitive topic
in society.

609
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,240
I hope that through this class,

610
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,530
reproductive health

611
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:28,280
can become as common a topic
as eating or sleeping.

612
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,970
Why are you still up?

613
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,570
My slippers.

614
00:34:47,930 --> 00:34:49,120
Are you not feeling well?

615
00:34:49,930 --> 00:34:51,160
Hurry and go to sleep.

616
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,720
You have to go to school early tomorrow.

617
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,120
Did you do something to my textbook?

618
00:34:59,370 --> 00:34:59,850
Hmm.

619
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:02,320
What's wrong?

620
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,410
Did you argue with someone at school?

621
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,080
Was the food at the canteen terrible?

622
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,200
You can cancel the school meal tomorrow.

623
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,400
Your dad and I will prepare it for you.

624
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,560
Take it with you to school.

625
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:13,930
It's not about food.

626

the new school?

627
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,050
Don't worry.
Try to make some new friends.

628
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:18,450
Right?

629
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,490
You'll get used to it over time.

630
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,530
What's this?

631
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,200
These are useless stuff.

632
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,560
It's not tested in NCEE.
You're not reading this nonsense.

633
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,930
This is a school textbook.

634
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:35,880
I don't care about others,

635
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:36,840
but you're not reading

636
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,890
this nonsense.

637
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,680
It's part of the curriculum.

638
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,570
Qiao Qingyu, how old are you?

639
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:44,370
You're 17.

640
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:46,240
Why does a 17-year-old girl

641
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,600
need to read such nonsense?

642
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,680
You didn't teach Qiao Beiyu back then,

643
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,160
that's why she ended up like that.

644
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:56,160
She ended up that way

645
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,280
because she read nonsense

646
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,320
like this.

647
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,120
Talk nicely.

648
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,050
You...

649
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:03,320
Didn't we agree

650
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,640
not to bring this up again
after moving to Huanzhou?

651
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:12,600
It's late now.

652
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,160
You're disturbing my sleep.

653
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:17,320
Right. They have to go
to school tomorrow.

654
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:17,840
Go to sleep.

655
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,760

Get rest early.

656

All right. Back to bed.

657
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:32,680
Don't be mad. She didn't mean it.

658
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:35,370
I did.

661

Why are you walking so fast?

662
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:03,760
We're classmates.

663
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,160
We'll be seeing a lot of each other.

664
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,320
What exactly do you want?

665
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,570
How are you going to compensate me?

666
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,600
Bite me back,

667
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,680
and then we're even.

668

If it were someone else,

669
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:18,850
the consequence would be different.

670
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,440
If it weren't for your decent grades,

671
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,930
