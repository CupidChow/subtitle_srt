I tricked you, silly.

16
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:44,620
You're so despicable.

17
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:47,180
Wait, how was I supposed

18
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,870
to know you'd risk your life
for that file?

19
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,510
Good thing I saved your life.

She has been through a lot.

28
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,140
Give it to me.

29
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:38,790
Give it to me.

30
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,630
Are you the one who told them?

31
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,420
Told them what?

00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,740

them about Qiao Beiyu?

(Pharmacy, Service Center)

35
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,980
Your test results look fine.

36
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,260
It's natural for girls to care
about their appearance,

37
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,790
but you shouldn't diet recklessly.

38
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,350
I'll prescribe you something
to strengthen your digestion,

39
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,420
but you need to exercise more too.

40
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,980
Honestly, you're not even fat.

41
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,420
Doctor, I want to ask something.

42
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,110
Was there a patient named Qiao Beiyu

43
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:42,140
who died from an appendectomy
at this hospital?

44
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,470
We can't disclose a
patient's private information.

45
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,190
What's your relation to her anyway?

46
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,190
She's my sister.

47
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:49,230
Oh.

48
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,070
You'll need to ask
the attending physician.

49
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,020
He'd know more.

50
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:54,260
But in over 20 years
of our hospital's history,

51
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,820
no one has ever died from appendicitis.

What you're here for
has nothing to do with me.

56
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,350
You're here to see your dad, right?

57
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:40,760
None of your business.

58
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,800
You could actually get
Qiao Beiyu's medical records.

59
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,350
I can't.

60
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:44,910
Please.

61
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:47,740
I told you, I can't.

62
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,500
You could find out the truth,

63
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,910
but you won't tell me.

64
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:52,710
So you can keep
spreading lies, is that it?

65
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:53,710
You're overthinking it.

66
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,060
Medical records are private.

67
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,420
Besides, my dad and I don't get along.

Doctor, I'm begging you.

69
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,980
Please save our Qianqian.

70
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,060
She's only 28.

71
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,150
We don't want to give
up on her just like this.

72
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,500
Doctor, please.

73
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,270
Please save her.

74
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,740
Please calm down.

75

76
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,380
we have to hold a meeting

77
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,980
before we can give you any answers.

78
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,350
Please stay calm, alright?

79
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:27,980

80
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,110

My career plan for you is

105
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,420
to follow my path,

106
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,150
to become a doctor.

107
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:34,680
I want to pursue arts.

108
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,830
You won first prize in the
National Biology Competition.

109
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:39,180
Do you know why

110
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,110
I entered that biology competition?

111
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:42,790
Why I fought so desperately

112
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:44,030
to win first place?

113
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:47,620
I wanted to prove to you

114
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,270
that I wasn't incapable.

115
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:50,740
I just hate it.

116
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:52,860
I hate studying medicine.

117
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,350
I hate you.

118
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,150
I don't want you controlling my life!

119
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,420
You went through all that trouble,

120
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,060
even at the cost of your future,

121
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,060
just to spite me?

122
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,030
Son,

123
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:10,710
that's not capability,

124
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:11,910
that's immaturity.

125
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,740
This form requires parental consent.

126
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,420
This is my decision.

127
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,060
Your decision means forcing your will

128
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,200
onto others, right?

129
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,600
You never consider others' feelings.

130
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,060
Just like when you drove my mom away,

131
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,000
when you pulled the plug
on grandpa's ventilator,

132
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,040
it was the same, wasn't it?

133
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:33,420
Just because you wear a white coat,

134
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,470
you think you can control
other people's lives?

135
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:36,590
You're not a doctor.

136
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:37,980
You're a murderer!

137
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:42,860
Shut up.

138
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,860
That girl who died last year,

139
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,860
Qiao Beiyu, you remember her, don't you?

140
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,080
Can you really say

141
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,940
what happened to her had
nothing to do with you?

142
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,180
I will never study medicine.

143
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:55,980
I refuse to become

144
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,180
a horrible person like you.

145
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,800
We'll be busy tonight.

146
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,710
We got an order from
the nearby construction site.

147
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:24,980
They have over 100 workers.

148
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,670
Don't wait for us at dinner.

149
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:34,310
Just make something simple at home,

150
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:36,550
fry some eggs.

151
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:37,830
There's milk in the fridge.

152
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,190
Your health comes first.

153
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:43,380
I'm going out now.

154
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,350
This detergent's still good.

155
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:52,590
If we dilute it,
it'll last another week.

156
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:02,110
Qingyu.

157
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:04,740
What are you doing?

158
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:17,550
By the way,

159
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,070
wake Jinyu up.

160
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,230
Hang the clothes out.

161
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,660
I don't care if you're a boy or girl.

162
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,140
When I call your name,

163
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,950
will you answer me?

164
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,590
Qiao Qingyu!

165
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:43,830
What is wrong with you?

166
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,500
You're no fun.

167
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,830
I went to People's Hospital yesterday.

168
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,640
Were you not feeling well?

169
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,190
You went to investigate Beiyu's case?

170
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:08,020
I spoke to several doctors and nurses.

171
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,660
They all said the hospital

172
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,660
had zero appendicitis deaths
in recent years.

173
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,190
Does that mean

174
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:16,620
Mom, Dad, and Jinrui were lying?

175
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,590
I don't know.

176
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:20,760
But I just

177
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,070
saw that the drawer in Mom
and Dad's room has a lock on it.

178
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:25,070
We've never locked any
drawers in our house before.

179
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,020
They racked up tens of thousands
of yuan in debt treating Qiao Beiyu.

180
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,470
Then we moved and added more debt.

181
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:32,350
With our financial situation,

182
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:33,900
even burglars would pity us.

183
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,070
A lock does seem unnecessary.

184
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:38,190
Unless there's something they're hiding.

185
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:41,740
If we could open that drawer,

186
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,830
we might find medical records,
hospital receipts

187
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:44,860
something that has to do

188
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,830
with Beiyu's condition.

189
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:49,260
I think you should drop it.

190
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:52,230
That lock isn't to keep out thieves,

191
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:54,140
it's specifically to keep us out.

192
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,310
And you still want to go poking around?

193
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:01,470
Aren't you afraid Mom
will skin you alive?

194
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:03,260
Besides,

195
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:07,140
even if they are hiding something,

196
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,660
adults must have their reasons.

197
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,470
What if

198
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:16,470
Qiao Beiyu really died
of that kind of illness?

199
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,190
Some truths

200
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:21,140
are better left unknown.

201
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:22,710
So we should

202
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:23,860
avoid truth

203
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,040
just because it might hurt?

204
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,500
Isn't that just lying to ourselves?

205
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,230
I can't out-debate you, honor student.

206
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,860
But still, I really think
we should drop it.

207
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,020
She's gone.

208
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:44,020
(A life lived in lies is true tragedy.)

209
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,070
(The most painful truth)

210
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,350
(is better than the sweetest lie.)

211
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:55,640
This is our last exam before

212
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,500
(Class 5 Year 11)
the National Day holiday break.

213
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,590
I expect everyone to perform

214
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:00,070
to the best of your abilities.

215
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:03,430
Double-check your answer sheets
and scratch paper.

216
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,070
Let me emphasize again,

217
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:06,550
never underestimate monthly exams.

218
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:08,320
Treat every practice test

219
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,230
as seriously as the actual
college entrance exam.

220
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,840
We must continuously improve ourselves,

221
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,950
hone our skills, understood?

222
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:14,310
Now, pass the papers back.

223
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,550
Stay focused and careful.

224
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,740
Read the questions thoroughly first,

225
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,880
only start answering after
you've fully understood them.

226
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,950
(When we were little,
everyone used to say,)

227
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:48,500
("Just grow up faster.)

228
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:52,020
(Everything will be better
when you're older".)

229
00:12:52,056 --> 00:12:53,223
♪I saw hope outside♪

230
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:56,020
(Seventeen, no looking back)
(But why is it that the older we get,)

231
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:59,140
(the more confusion
and troubles we face?)

232
00:12:59,173 --> 00:13:00,800
♪You spoke words I couldn't comprehend♪

233
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:01,660
(Seventeen.)

234
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:04,830
(I don't want to be seen
as just a kid anymore.)

235
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:08,980
(Even if it's heavy, even if it hurts,
I want to find my own strength.)

236
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:13,620
♪You lit a lamp♪

237
00:13:15,897 --> 00:13:19,540
♪I saw the light♪

238
00:13:19,557 --> 00:13:21,940
(This reckless, passionate seventeen...)

239
00:13:22,214 --> 00:13:23,651
♪As you walked away♪

240
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,470
(I believe)

241
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:27,310
(as long as I follow
the truth in my heart)

242
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:28,380
(and stay true to myself.)

243
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,190
(No hardship can stop me.)

244
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,070
(Seventeen,)

245
00:13:33,645 --> 00:13:35,900
(the path may still
be thorny and rough,)

246
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,740
(but I know)

247
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,590
(hope and light await ahead.)

248
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,190
Easy there, dad.

249
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,590
It's completely soaked.

250
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,550
Yes.

251
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:02,950
Let's see.

252
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,740
Dad, Mom.

253
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:09,260
You're back.

254
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,500
Dad, Mom,

255
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,500
we're back.

256
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,980
Easy there.

257
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:13,980
Say hi.

258
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,070
Hi, Grandpa, Grandma, Uncle.

259
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:16,860
Hi.

260
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,230
This year's rains have been frequent.

261
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:22,190
Yes. Good thing Jinrui reminded us.

262
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:23,980
He checks the weather forecast every day

263
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,230
and he warned us in advance.

264
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:28,070
He told us to move into
Haisheng's apartment building.

265
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:30,980
Who knows what state
we'd be in otherwise.

266
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:31,950
Mom, just put that down.

267
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:32,380
See.

268
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,070
We'll put them away later.

269
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:34,860
Just leave it.

270
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:37,350
Mom, just leave it to us.

271
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,190
Here.

272
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,980
It's okay, just leave it.

273
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:42,590
We got it.

274
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,660
Just take a break.

275
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:45,470
Qing...

276
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:48,190
You've gotten taller and thinner.

277
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,020
Other girls in your age look
bright and full of life.

278
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,020
Why do you look so pale?

279
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,500
Fanghao,

280
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,660
you shouldn't spend all day

281
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,860
obsessing over business and money.

282
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,590
Take better care

283
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:02,500
of your children.

284
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,380
Mom, she's been taking
good care of them.

285
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,710
Now that you're back,

286
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,020
I'll take Mom and Dad home.

287
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,140
Sure, sure.

288
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,260
Go home and rest, Mom and Dad.

289
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,830
We'll clean up the place.

290
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:12,710
Walk Grandma out.

291
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:13,500
Okay.

292
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:14,470
Bye.

293
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,740
Careful, it's slippery.

294
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:16,500
Okay.

295
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:18,780
Haisheng.

296
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,740
I bought our parents something.

297
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,140
Go home now.

298
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:22,860
Lusheng.

299
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,600
Your family will have to
make do in the old house

300
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,640
for these next few days.

301
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,240
Here, take it.

302
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,500
I don't think I should, Grandma.

303
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:30,070
Don't let your sister see it.

304
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:32,380
Okay.

305
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,190
Put it away.

306
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:34,780
Thanks, Mom.

307
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:35,710
Let me walk you out.

308
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:36,140
Okay.

309
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,660
Don't tell me you're going

310
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,780
to keep playing detective here.

311
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:25,260
We get flooded every year
during the rainy season.

312
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:27,470
This old house is deteriorating.

313
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:28,740
Look over there,

314
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,780
the wood's rotted.

315
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:34,140
I was thinking,

316
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,470
after we finish cleaning up,

317
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:38,980
maybe we should renovate this old house.

318
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,070
What do you think?

319
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:42,400
At least then Mom and Dad
could live more comfortably.

320
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,980
Sure. Renovate if you've got the money.

321
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,900
Well, about the money,

322
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,480
we young folks can
just tighten our belts a little.

323
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,310
Surely we can scrape together something.

324
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:54,380
Sure.

325
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:57,110
However much you can scrape,
you go right ahead.

326
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:00,190
Come on.

327
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:01,980
I'm just trying
to talk it over with you here.

328
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:03,950
I didn't say no, did I?

329
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:05,350
Didn't I already say okay?

330
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,660
Your family's affairs
always come first anyway.

331
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,270
We finally get a National Day break,

332
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,510
would've been nice
if the kids could rest at home,

333
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,620
catch up on studies,
get some proper rest.

334
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,830
But no, we had to come back here.

335
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:21,750
What's even the point?

336
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,080
Alright.

337
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,040
Just adding to the mess.

338
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:23,560
Okay, okay.

339
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,760
Let's just clean up the place.

340
00:17:29,017 --> 00:17:30,530
(Dream Catcher)

341
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,270
Check this out!

342
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,510
You're disturbing me! Who is it?

343
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,070
Let me introduce you,

344
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:03,140
Shunyun's prettiest girl,

345
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,590
Qiao Beiyu.

346
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,080
Oh, the gorgeous girl who
passed away from illness, right?

347
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,040
If you hadn't told me,
I wouldn't have known that

348
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,520
the new transfer student in our class,
Qiao Qingyu, is her younger sister.

349
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,360
I just found out too.

350
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,900
Hey, are we still playing or not?

351
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,070
Yes, yes.

352
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:17,070
Just taking a little gossip break.
We can do both.

353
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:18,990
I heard

354
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:20,380
that Qiao Beiyu,

355
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,070
despite looking all cold
and unapproachable,

356
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,310
could get

357
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,700
really passionate

358
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,270
if a guy treats her nicely.

359
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,480
Wow, you know her that well?

360
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,080
Don't tell me you had a thing for her.

361
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,620
No, I just heard it from Hei.

362
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,030
You know who he is, right?

363
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,070
My sworn brother.

364
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,380
He said he used to date Qiao Beiyu.

365
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,990
Hei is your sworn brother?

366
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,040
Since when?

367
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,140
Is that really the point?

368
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,420
The point is Qiao Beiyu.

369
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,110
Think about it,

370
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:47,600
if Qiao Beiyu was
Shunyun's prettiest girl,

371
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,700
her younger sister must be the
second prettiest girl, right?

372
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,420
Since they both look alike,

373
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,460
maybe their personalities
are similar too?

374
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,550
Maybe Qiao Qingyu is also...

375
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,620
Your hoop is over there.

376
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:02,790
It slipped.

377
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,270
I have to go.

378
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,380
You guys carry on.

379
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:09,860
What has gotten over him?

380
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,940
(I'm not the one who told
people about your sister.)

381
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,180
(Want to know who told them?)

382
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:42,180
(Have you finished your homework?)

383
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,270
Sheng.

384
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,270
Why are you leaving?

385
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,140
Who are you texting?

386
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:51,750
None of your business.

387
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:53,140
I was just asking.

388
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,030
"Protecting the environment
starts with me.

389
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,750
Give nearby trash a proper home."

390
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,510
So what, want me to
find a home for you?

391
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:04,750
Hold up.

392
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:07,350
You were definitely
texting a girl just now.

393
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,940
Why are you always up
in everyone's business?

394
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:12,830
Mind your own business.

395
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,420
Come on, let's go eat.

396
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:20,790
Mind your own business.

397
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,180
Let's go.

398
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,620
Thanks, ma'am.

399
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:38,080
By the way,

400
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,280
don't forget to add extra
chili to my sister's portion.

401
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:40,860
Got it.

402
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,030
Madam Xuehua,

403
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,550
there's something I'd like to ask you.

404
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:49,750
Go ahead, what is it?

405
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:51,510
It's about Qiao Beiyu.

406
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:01,270
People called her a "temptress jinx",

407
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:03,700
but I always thought she
was just tragically beautiful.

408
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:07,110
She was sent off to the countryside

409
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,660
at such young age.

410
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,590
(And your parents)

411
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,180
(visited her only once
every few months.)

412
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,830
(Your grandparents,)

413
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,480
(well, they were old.)

414
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,680
(They didn't have the energy
to really take care of her.)

415
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:23,460
(She grew up in this village)

416
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,180
(like a wild child.)

417
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,900
(But you know what's strange?)

418
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:37,460
(Even though no one cared for her,)

419
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,700
(that girl only got more
and more beautiful.)

420
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,070
(She danced beautifully too.)

421
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,420
(She was very talented.)

422
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:45,510
(I heard that a dance academy)

423
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:49,460
(from Beining scouted her.)

424
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,790
(But for some reason,)

425
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:53,070
(she ended up going to
Huanzhou Art School instead.)

426
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:55,660
(I heard it's just a vocational college.
What a pity.)

427
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,660
Qingyu, look.

428
00:22:42,597 --> 00:22:45,240
(To Qingyu)

429
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:50,074
(To Qingyu)

430
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:50,990
(You hardly ever)

431
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:53,860
(came back to Nanqiao Village
when you were little.)

432
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:56,640
(But your sister
really missed you a lot.)

433
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,040
(Whenever she had something
nice, she always saved it for you.)

434
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,370
(To Qingyu)

435
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,270
Qingyu, Jinyu, come out.

436
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,700
Throw out that feather lamp,

437
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,550
and all that other useless junk too.

438
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,830
Mom, even the floor lamp?

439
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,790
It's still in good shape.

440
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:21,310
Just needs a new bulb.

441
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:22,790
Just throw it out.

442
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:26,380
But that was Beiyu's favorite.

443
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,420
I remember

444
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,660
that it was a gift from Jinrui.

445
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,990
Didn't you hear me?

446
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:33,040
It's all useless stuff.

447
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,400
Looks nice, but serves no purpose.

448
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:36,900
This place floods

449
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:37,920
year after year.

450
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,520
We should've tossed everything long ago.

451
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:02,940
This old house wasn't so bad to live in.

452
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:05,110
If I hadn't lost that job

453
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,030
at the power station back then,

454
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:08,590
we could've stayed here together.

455
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,080
Life wouldn't have been this exhausting.

456
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:13,940
Running a noodle shop

457
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,270
while raising kids,

458
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,750
and Bei wouldn't have
ended up separated from us.

459
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:26,990
I remember when we were little,

460
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:30,030
every time we came
back to Nanqiao Village,

461
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,790
she'd always save the best food and toys

462
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:33,750
for us.

463
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,070
If

464
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:39,900
Qiao Beiyu had stayed with us,

465
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,140
if she'd stayed in Shunyun
with Mom and Dad,

466
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,000
how different would her life have been?

467
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,940
Grandma and Grandpa always said

468
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:49,270
that Mom and Dad's two hands

469
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,620
couldn't support the three of us.

470
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:51,790
So

471
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:54,590
they left her behind in Nanqiao Village.

472
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:59,070
If the one left behind
had been you or me,

473
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,990
would Qiao Beiyu have had a better life?

474
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:06,920
(Certificate: To Qiao Beiyu
Your competition essay)

475
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,710
(First Prize in the 7th "Sunshine
Essay Collection" Writing Competition)

476
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:13,180
Fanghao.

477
00:25:14,131 --> 00:25:14,620
Fanghao.

478
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:15,790
Look at this.

479
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,790
Remember that year you promised Bei

480
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:23,180
if she won the writing competition,

481
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,790
we'd take her to Wumu Mountain?

482
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,550
Then during National Day,
we were too busy.

483
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:28,590
We couldn't go.

484
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:29,590
When I called to tell her

485
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:30,460
that we couldn't go,

486
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,110
she said

487
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:32,510
it was okay

488
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,110
because she didn't win anyway.

489
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,990
(Certificate: To Qiao Beiyu
Your competition essay)

490
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:50,160
(7th "Sunshine Essay Collection")
Turns out she did win.

491
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,310
She just never told us.

492
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:55,860
What were we thinking back then?

493
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:59,310
Why didn't we try harder?

494
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:03,350
We already had Yu at the time.

495
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,380
If we'd just persisted a little more,

496
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,750
maybe Dad would've agreed

497
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,350
to let Bei come home with us.

498
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,270
Then none of what came
after would've happened.

499
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:18,380
Somehow, without noticing,

500
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:19,900
Qiao Beiyu became

501
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,660
a complete and utter sinner.

502
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:24,990
Mom flies into a rage
at the mere mention of her.

503
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:27,620
Dad just shakes his head and sighs.

504
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:29,620
I hated her too.

505
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:32,700
I hated how she always stood out,

506
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,350
how she made me seem like the obedient,

507
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:36,220
boring one with no opinions of my own.

508
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,420
But it's also true

509
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:39,510
that she'd take punishments for you

510
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:42,460
and secretly save candy for me.

511
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,110
Alright,

512
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:46,940
enough with the emotional monologue.

513
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,310
The dead can't come back.

514
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,940
Beiyu is gone.

515
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,620
This chapter is closed.

516
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:05,860
Mr. Sun,

517
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:06,600
I'll submit

518
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,270
the subject selection form
this afternoon.

519
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:09,440
I couldn't get it sign earlier

520
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,080
because my dad was away
on a business trip.

521
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:12,180
Don't worry,

522
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:14,550
I'll get it to you
before your training ends.

523
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:16,590
Okay.

524
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:21,220
Let me see.

525
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:23,110
Hey, check mine out.

526
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,350
Why is there English on it?

527
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:27,830
Your dad's the hospital director, right?

528
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:29,590
Figured the signature
should be more fancy.

529
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:30,510
You're absurd.

530
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,030
Sign here.

531
00:27:43,671 --> 00:27:45,850
(High school subject stream

532
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:50,700
How's this?

533
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,140
Hmm.

534
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:54,070
Good?

535
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:55,860
Decent, I guess.

536
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,070
Way better than yours.

537
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:58,380
Just look at what you wrote.

538
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,750
At least this one is in Chinese.

539
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,860
Sun is easy to fool,

540
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,840
but good luck explaining this
to your dad.

541
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,440
No worries.
My dad doesn't care about me.

542
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,000
Even if he did, he couldn't control me.

543
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:07,320
Alright.

544
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,760
The whole class has turned theirs in,

545
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,760
you're the only one left.

546
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,110
Hand it in before break ends.

547
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:11,700
Hmm.

548
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,790
You went through all that trouble,

549
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,750
even at the cost of your future,

550
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,140
just to spite me?

551
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:34,510
That's not capability,

552
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:35,700
that's immaturity.

553
00:28:35,771 --> 00:28:39,010
(High school subject stream

554

556
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:58,660
You're home.

557
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:00,180
Fanghao.

558
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,660
Haisheng said you were back.

559
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:04,070
When did you arrive?

560
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:05,030
Early morning.

561
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:07,350
We took the first train here.

562
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,310
You're just in time.

563
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:09,310
Get ready for dinner.

564
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:10,550
One more soup coming right up.

565
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:11,750
Dinner's ready.

566
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,350
After such a long trip,

567
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:15,750
you shouldn't have cooked for us.

568
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:16,510
Nonsense.

569
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:17,460
Take a seat.

570
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,110
Sit, Wenqiu.

571
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:20,380
Uncle Jiangsheng, Aunt Wenqiu.

572
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:21,940
The soup's ready.

573
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:23,940
Bei?

574
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:28,700
Bei!

575
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:30,380
No, she's not Bei.

576
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:30,830
Bei!

577
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:31,420
Wenqiu.

578
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:32,350
Aunt Wenqiu.

579
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,550
Wenqiu,

580
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:34,180
let go of her.

581
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,900
This is Qingyu, not Beiyu.

582
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:36,440
You're back.

583
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,220
Wenqiu, let her go.

584
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,420
I've missed you so much, Bei.

585
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,270
Let go.

586
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:39,750
Bei...

587
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:40,320
Aunt Wenqiu.

588
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,110
Look at the flowers.

589
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:41,790
Let go first.

590
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:42,660
Look at the flowers.

591
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,270
Aunt Wenqiu.

592
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:44,380
You're crushing them.

593
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:46,270
The flowers...

594
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,270
The flowers...

595
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:49,940
Bei.

596
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:51,510
Bei.

597
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:53,510
Let's eat first.

598
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:54,830
Come on.

599
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,270
You guys eat without us.

600
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,660
We'll just eat in our room.

601
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,380
Come on, let's have dinner.

602
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:02,660
Let's go.

603
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:08,550
Are you okay?

604
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:11,620
Come.

605
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:13,550
Bei...

606
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:16,110
You can pick some
more flowers for her later.

607
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:35,940
So,

608
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:38,220
Fanghao, Lusheng,

609
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,270
Wenqiu has episodes sometimes.

610
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,140
I hope she didn't scare Qingyu.

611
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,900
No, she's fine.

612
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:44,940
Keep drinking.

613
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:56,900
Qin still seems

614
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:57,790
a little...

615
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,940
Ever since we lost our child,

616
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:04,660
she hasn't been the same.

617
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,270
She suffered a mental breakdown.

618
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,110
We've seen a lot of doctors,

619
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:11,270
they all say it's psychological.

620
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,310
There's no real cure.

621
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,590
You've really had a tough time.

622
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,140
Slow down now.

623
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:22,790
I'm glad you're back.

624
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:27,550
We used to dream of a simple life,

625
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,800
getting married, having a kid,

626
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,070
and living peacefully.

627
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,460
Wenqiu always loved children.

628
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,550
But now, in her condition,

629
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:39,750
she can't have any.

630
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:41,860
She can't be without me.

631
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:43,790
I've accepted that.

632
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,140
I can't be without her either.

633
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:47,700
Jiangsheng,

634
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:50,270
every family has its struggles.

635
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:51,620
Life goes on,

636
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,070
it gets better with time.

637
00:31:58,270 --> 00:31:59,270
You're lucky.

638
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:01,940
You have Qing and Yu,

639
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:04,140
they'll grow up soon.

640
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:06,420
But speaking of which,

641
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:08,270
Qing's grown so fast.

642
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:11,030
When she walked in,
I didn't recognize her.

643
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,180
I thought she was her sister.

644
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:18,620
Don't be ridiculous.

645
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:24,140
Enjoy your drinking.

646
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:30,420
Lusheng,

647
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:32,860
I didn't mean it like that.

648
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:37,140
But girls harder to manage when older.

649
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,550
You'd better keep close watch.

650
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:43,180
Jiangsheng...

651
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:45,030
Let's drink.

652
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:51,420
I...

653
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:52,660
Drink.

654
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,510
Before Beiyu left
for Huanzhou Art School,

655
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,160
she'd been living here at the old house.

656
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,900
She was really close with Aunt Qin.

657
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,990
After living together all those years,

658
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:09,380
they must've bonded deeply.

659
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:12,900
No wonder she mistook you for Beiyu.

660
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:15,620
When Aunt Qin hugged me earlier,

661
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:17,220
she held me so tightly.

662
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,510
She couldn't even
say a word for a while.

663
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,700
She's not mentally well.

664
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,310
Don't take it seriously.

665
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:26,350
But she was genuine.

666
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,990
I think she really cared about Beiyu.

667
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:30,860
It's a shame that Beiyu...

668
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,460
A shame, but not surprising.

669
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:37,990
Everyone else speaks ill

670
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:39,220
of Qiao Beiyu,

671
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:42,140
turns out Aunt Qin was
the only one who stuck by her.

672
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,380
What do you think

673
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:46,900
really happened to Qiao Beiyu

674
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,310
that made Aunt Qin

675
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:50,110
care for her so desperately?

676
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:03,270
Sheng.

677
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:04,790
Sheng.

678
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:10,260
Sheng!

679
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:11,620
Sheng!

680
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,510
I live at the head of the Yangtze River,

681
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:15,110
you live at its tail.

682
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:16,590
I'm in the science track,

683
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:17,820
you're in the arts.

684
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,470
We're like two parallel lines,

685
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:21,040
never to cross paths again.

686
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:21,910
Just thinking about it

687
00:34:21,910 --> 00:34:23,200
fills me with unbearable sorrow.

688
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,430
I can't pull myself out of it.

689
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:26,110
Drama queen.

690
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:27,140
Sheng,

691
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:28,740
even though you've chosen arts,

692
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:29,990
we're still friends.

693
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:31,840
Let's grab dinner tonight,

694
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,000
consider it a farewell feast.

695
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,390
I've thought it over.

696
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,260
I'll take science after all.

697
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,400
What?

698
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,300
You changed your mind?

699
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,870
Judging by your reactions,

700
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,110
you don't seem too thrilled.

701
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,110
Worried I'll steal your spotlight?

702
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:45,260
No,

703
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,550
we're just confused.

704
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:48,470
Weren't you rebelling against your dad?

705
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,260
Why the sudden change of heart?

706
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:51,990
This is my decision.

707
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,390
It has nothing to do with him.

708
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:00,700
Warm up first, man!

709
00:35:28,731 --> 00:35:29,460
(Literature)

710
00:35:48,917 --> 00:35:50,380
(Qiao Beiyu)

711
00:35:51,248 --> 00:35:57,500
(Love is the most radiant element here,
yet also the fuse of catastrophe.)

712
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,110
Qingyu?

713
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:09,110
Ma Mingkai.

714
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:16,470
I'm back

715
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:17,950
to visit my grandparents.

716
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:20,700
It's been

717
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,780
a long time since
we last saw each other, huh?

718
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:27,510
By the way,

719
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:30,390
I wrote you a letter a while back.

720
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:32,820
Why didn't you ever write me back?

721
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:35,260
I never received any letters.

722
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,820
Must've gone to the wrong address.

723
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,820
People don't really
write letters these days.

724
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:43,510
Good thing

725
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:45,660
you weren't ignoring me

726
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:46,590
on purpose.

727
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:48,780
So what did you write?

728
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:52,260
Nothing special really.

729
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:57,220
Qingyu,

730
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,660
how about we go study

731
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:00,780
in the library together
tomorrow morning?

732
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:02,510
You're good at your studies.

733
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,820
There are a few questions
I could use your help with.

734
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,110
Ma Mingkai,

735
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:09,220
thank you.

736
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:11,220
For what?

737
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,440
Thank you for still being
willing to hang out with me.

738
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,140
Actually,

739
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:16,470
I've heard the rumors.

740
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,870
But Beiyu is Beiyu, and you're you.

741
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,390
You shouldn't be held accountable

742
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:21,300
for her actions.

743
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:22,740
Besides,

744
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:24,820
the Qingyu I know

745
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:27,110
is an exemplary student,

746
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:28,990
never steps out of line.

747
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:31,140
Obedient and proper.

748
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:34,140
"Obedient and proper"?

749
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:35,260
I just mean

750
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:37,140
you're not the same as your sister.

751
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:41,740
I have something to do today.

752
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:42,550
I have to go.

753
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,140
See you tomorrow then.

754
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,828
(Medical Records Release
Authorization Form)

755
00:38:14,831 --> 00:38:16,140
(What if)

756
00:38:16,605 --> 00:38:19,965
(Qiao Beiyu really died
of that kind of illness?)

757
00:38:19,994 --> 00:38:23,220
(Such truth is better left unknown.)

758
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:25,590
Nice shot!

759
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:26,910
I give up.

760
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:27,660
I can't beat you.

761
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:28,590
I'm done. Let's go.

762
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:30,200
Come on, let's go home.

763
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,470
We'll play again next time. Bye.

764
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:32,220
Next time then.

765
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:45,430
Washboard.

766
00:38:45,774 --> 00:38:47,994
(Qiao Qingyu:
You stole the letters Ma Mingkai sent me.)

767
00:38:48,328 --> 00:38:49,482
(I asked the class monitor.)

768
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,205
(You were the one in
charge of picking up)

769
00:38:51,228 --> 00:38:53,200
(everyone's mail from
the mailroom last month.)

770
00:38:55,237 --> 00:38:58,645
(Ming Sheng:
Wasn't me. Don't accuse the wrong person.)

771
00:39:02,854 --> 00:39:06,580
(Medical Records
Release Authorization Form)

772
00:39:12,882 --> 00:39:14,240
(Qiao Qingyu: Then do me a favor.)

773
00:39:14,551 --> 00:39:16,188
(I want my sister's medical records.)

774
00:39:16,502 --> 00:39:19,425
(I've filled out the release form.)

775
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:27,017
(Ming Sheng:
Best I can do is get you copies.)

776
00:39:28,294 --> 00:39:31,105
(If I manage to get it,
how are you going to thank me?)

777
00:39:32,265 --> 00:39:33,662
(Qiao Qingyu:
What do you want?)

778
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:37,550
Sheng.

779
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:43,070
Those arched eyebrows,

780
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:45,870
those smiling lips,

781
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:48,590
they're sending a very clear signal.

782
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:52,620
He's possessed.

783
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,120
(I, Qiao Qingyu, as a family
member of Qiao Beiyu,)

784
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,760
(request Huanzhou People's Hospital
to provide complete medical records)

785
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,920
(including all emergency
visits and inpatient admissions.)

786
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,110
Madam Xiuzhen?

787
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:21,140
Hi, Qing. You've grown tall.

788
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:21,660
My uncle

789
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:22,740
and my parents went out.

790
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,070
They're not back yet.

791
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:25,220
It's fine.

792
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:27,430
Your uncle asked me to check on Qin.

793
00:40:57,590 --> 00:40:58,390
How is she?

794
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,740
She looks alright for now.

795
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:03,590
But I'm just a clinic health
worker at the village infirmary.

796
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:05,390
I'm not qualified to diagnose this.

797
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:07,030
Your uncle asked me to come by

798
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:08,390
just for peace of mind.

799
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:10,700
Make sure she doesn't have
another episode and wander off.

800
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:13,760
Remind your uncle that

801
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,180
he needs to keep a close eye on her.

802
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:17,220
She can't take another shock.

803
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:20,110
Madam Xiuzhen,

804
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:22,220
you're a health worker
at the village clinic?

805
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:22,740
That's right.

806
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:24,140
Over 20 years now.

807
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:25,910
Every illness in this village,

808
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:26,870
I usually know about it.

809
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:29,550
Then do you know about Qiao Beiyu?

810
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:32,950
Beiyu, huh...

811
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:35,180
Of course I heard the rumors.

812
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:36,550
Everyone was talking.

813
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:38,870
But whether she really
had that kind of illness,

814
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:40,070
I don't know.

815
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:42,950
One thing though,

816
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:45,390
