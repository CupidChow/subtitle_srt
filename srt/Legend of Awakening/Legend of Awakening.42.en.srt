♫ The dark green sea is hazy ♫

3
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,740
♫ dissipating in a flash ♫

4
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:36,650
♫ Rivers and lakes divide the world ♫

5
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:39,940
♫ Ten thousands arrows are firing at once ♫

6
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,970
♫ Who has time to worry? Who loves the color of blood? ♫

7
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:47,780
♫ At that time, spirits are high ♫

8
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:51,610
♫ Who calls the world his home?
Who dares let his horse freely run? ♫

9
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:54,370
♫ Silently, tears form in the death of night ♫

10
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:58,260
♫ Heroes are cutting all ties, ♫

11
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,030
♫ giving up whether it's life or death, ♫

12
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:04,190
♫ never asking what the cost is ♫

13
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:09,810
♫ Good and evil must be distinguished ♫

14
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,710
♫ The wind blows off the snow ♫

15
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:17,660
♫ On the body, etch multiple scars, ♫

16
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,750
♫ wandering all over the world, ♫

17
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:25,090
♫ only wish to ask for answers from this world ♫

18

♫ A teenager doesn't have to be a hero ♫

[Episode 42]

29
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:04,771
Father, I beg you. Lu Ping is my brother through thick or thin.

30
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:05,511
I said before, I wouldn't let anyone block my way.

31
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:09,591
Lu Ping, I know you just want to be an ordinary person.

32
00:04:09,591 --> 00:04:12,831
You want to have an ordinary life.

33
00:04:12,831 --> 00:04:17,989
But haven't you realized that if you keep walking down the wrong path, keep doing the wrong things,

34
00:04:17,989 --> 00:04:21,631
that if you keep going, you won't be able to turn back anymore?

35
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:26,951
Now, you can kill me, vent your anger,

36
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,991
then just stop.

37
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,620
Even if I wanted to stop,

38
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:37,010
will Zhai Rong stop?

39
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,280
Lu Ping, if you continue like this, what's the difference between you and Liu Song?

40
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,111
He will take you to hell together with him.

41
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,911
I crawled out of hell already.

42
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,171
I want to see...

43
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,131
just how many devils there are in this world.

44
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:07,451
Lu Ping! Lu Ping!

45
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:13,391
Lu Ping. Lu Ping.

46
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:19,711
Lu Ping!

47
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:24,251
Lu Ping!

48
00:05:24,251 --> 00:05:26,591
Lu Ping!

49
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,531
Lu Ping.

50
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,951
Yan Jin.

51
00:05:46,951 --> 00:05:52,431
As Master expected, it was a good show.

52
00:05:52,431 --> 00:05:55,511
Master Yan, I pass a word on from Master to you.

53
00:05:55,511 --> 00:05:59,771
Wuji Manor is over.

54
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:30,959
Where is Yan Qiuci? Why hasn't he come back yet? Is he kidding us?

55
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:32,149
- That's right!
- Yes! Yes!

56
00:06:32,149 --> 00:06:33,889
He is kidding us. Tell him to come out here!

57
00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:39,599
Wuji Manor committed many evil acts. We're here to avenge Master Leng. We will eliminate the devil!

58
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:41,739
- Yes.
- Tell him to come out! Out!

59
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,769
- Eliminate the devil!
- Get out here!

60
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:45,331
- Yes, tell him to get out here.
- Make Yan Qiuci come out!

61
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:52,419
Which sect are you from? Why are you pitting the sects against each other?

62
00:06:52,419 --> 00:06:56,531
Is it that you're spies from the Mountain and Sea Gang?

63
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:07,171
Endless Mountain and Sea deliver us from torment.

64
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,191
Avenge Master Leng! Eliminate the devil!

65
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,531
Father!

66
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,910
Father!

67
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,980
Father. Father.

68
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,559
You were hurt by the Thousand Pine Ruler. Lu Ping, he—

69
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:18,391
Mo Lin just died. He's lost his mind.

70
00:08:18,391 --> 00:08:22,969
Why did you come alone, Father? Aren't you the one who's always the most sensible?

71
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:29,771
In the affairs of Jianghu, it has always been the winner that takes all.

72
00:08:29,771 --> 00:08:34,051
Even if I'm called a bandit in defeat, I will not blame anyone else.

73
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:40,340
Fan'er, you are kind and honest.

74
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:45,239
To ask you to assume responsibility for this would be unfair to you.

75
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,151
Therefore I faced Lu Ping alone.

76
00:08:51,151 --> 00:08:54,091
It was better than you facing him.

77
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,111
No, Father. I hesitated too much.

78
00:09:00,111 --> 00:09:04,651
I didn't think through it well. I will help you back to treat your injury, Father.

79
00:09:04,651 --> 00:09:09,571
No. I have something important to ask you.

80
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,680
Go ahead, Father.

81
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,471
Until now, do you still think I was wrong?

82
00:09:18,471 --> 00:09:20,391
Do you look down on me?

83
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,611
Everything's already in the past.

84
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:29,399
What is important is that Wuji Manor has protected Jin City for more than ten years.

85
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:32,311
And you will always be my most respected father.

86
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,220
What happens next,

87
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:39,330
I know how to do.

88
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,940
Good. Good.

89
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,071
I can be at ease entrusting the Sword of Yan to you.

90
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:59,251
Right now, you need to go do what you need to do.

91
00:09:59,251 --> 00:10:04,431
Time and tide wait for no one. You are the son of Yan Qiuci.

92
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,511
I believe that you can be better than me.

93
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,891
I understand.

94
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,831
Help me up.

95
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:35,451
The tiger lives for a hundred years. He won't lie down after his death.

96
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:41,891
I, Yan Qiuci, won't be such a coward.

97
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:02,500
[Wuji]

98
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,931
The Mountain and Sea Gang sent their spies.

99
00:12:16,931 --> 00:12:21,711
They turned the sects against each other here and hurt Wuji Manor pretty badly.

100
00:12:21,711 --> 00:12:23,931
Then they escaped.

101
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:32,231
Go on out now. Stop cleaning.

102
00:12:32,231 --> 00:12:35,540
Yes. Everyone out.

103
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,971
- Yes.
- Yes.

104
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:52,690
[Wuji]

105
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:05,040
Xifan, if you feel sad, then cry it out.

106
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,791
As the young master, I can't cry.

107
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,051
Otherwise, Wuji Manor really will be done for.

108
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,551
Right now, right here, there's only Yan Xifan.

109
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,531
When I was young,

110
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,131
I hated that my father was always gone.

111
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,151
Mother told me that

112
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,291
it was his lifelong wish

113
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:42,731
to make Wuji Manor great.

114
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,871
As along as Wuji Manor existed,

115
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,571
then that's where home was.
[Wuji]

116
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:00,130
But, Ziyan,

117
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,810
from now on,

118
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,511
I don't have a home anymore.

119
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,771
You still have me.

120
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,731
As long as there are you and me, we have a home.

121
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:43,540
[Wuji]

122
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,660
Today, I'll personally drink with you.

123
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:07,759
First, a toast to Eldest Brother. I've avenged him. He's no longer wronged.

124
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:22,651
A second toast to Dan, may its merits be known again and the country restored.

125
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:34,411
Third, a toast to the society which has never disappointed me.

126
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,251
With just a mere spark,

127
00:15:38,251 --> 00:15:41,471
it can start and create a massive fire.

128
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:57,651
Revenge for Eldest Brother?

129
00:15:57,651 --> 00:16:01,191
You did that for your own selfish desires.

130
00:16:01,191 --> 00:16:05,031
You framed Wuji Manor and got Yan Qiuci killed.

131
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:08,571
You turned Jianghu into a pile of loose sand.

132
00:16:08,571 --> 00:16:13,259
Jin City has lost its skilled protectors, now you can invade the southern part of the country.

133
00:16:13,259 --> 00:16:17,111
What you want... isn't just to create chaos in Jianghu,

134
00:16:17,111 --> 00:16:20,239
but to throw Shuo into chaos; throw the world into chaos!

135
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:26,711
The one who did the killing was Lu Ping.

136
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,080
Impossible.

137
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:35,111
Aside from someone who can use six pneumas,

138
00:16:35,111 --> 00:16:39,091
no one else could defeat the master of the martial arts circles.

139
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,131
You used the death of Eldest Brother.

140
00:16:43,131 --> 00:16:46,709
You used his only child. You've destroyed him.

141
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:52,831
Hate has turned you into a devil.

142
00:16:52,831 --> 00:16:55,811
Now you want to drag him into hell.

143
00:16:55,811 --> 00:17:00,580
Liu Song, you truly are deplorable.

144
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,779
A person who understands the big picture is naturally good at sharpening his blades.

145
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:13,759
Lu Ping is now his true self.

146
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,260
His hatred is his true hatred.

147
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:20,831
He was always going to be my sharpest blade.

148
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:23,691
Yan Qiuci sharpened him to a point.

149
00:17:23,691 --> 00:17:28,451
The next one... is his real target.

150
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,391
What else are you planning to do?

151
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:43,010
[Wuji Manor - Meng State City- Shou - Kaifeng]

152
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,611
Do you feel better?

153
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:13,431
Father once said that young people should do what they should do.

154
00:18:13,431 --> 00:18:15,871
No matter how frivolous or wanton.

155
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:21,631
But once they grow up, they need to learn to shoulder their responsibilities.

156
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,791
I never thought that day would come so fast.

157
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,650
Ziyan,

158
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:34,100
thank you for staying with me.

159
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,810
Now that Father is gone,

160
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:41,250
I will take on his responsibilities.

No matter what, I have to face it.

315
00:36:12,851 --> 00:36:18,021
You have broken five locks.

316
00:36:18,021 --> 00:36:21,340
The last one is very weak.

317
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:27,340
If you receive too big of a shock to your body and mind, the Pneuma of Strength will become overactive, the last lock will be broken.

318
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:31,620
At that time, you won't be able to avoid death.

319
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:37,700
Master Mo, that day you used a silver needle to help me stabilize the sixth lock.

320
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,911
But now I don't need it.

321
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:44,361
Since my talent only brings conflicts,

322
00:36:44,361 --> 00:36:48,319
I would rather be happy for a moment and be my own master.

323
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:48,751
I wasn't filial. I wasn't able to protect Wuji Manor, wasn't able to protect the Yan Family.

324
00:37:48,751 --> 00:37:52,619
I've let you down, Father. Please forgive me.

325
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:02,151
From now on, there's only a road ahead of me that I can take.

326
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:58,339
In the past, so many people lined up trying to get into Wuji Manor.

327
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:00,860
To bask in the light of the master of the martial arts circles.

328
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:05,671
Now that Master has passed away, not a single one has even come to mourn for him.

329
00:39:05,671 --> 00:39:10,760
How can they be called the righteous in Jianghu? They are just people who will take advantage of the situation before them.

330
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:15,711
All good things must come to an end. You shouldn't care about it too much, Uncle Wei.

331
00:39:15,711 --> 00:39:21,320
Do they think that the people from Wuji Manor have all died? They don't even care about you.

332
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:27,031
If you still regard me as your young master, please do me one last favor.

333
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:30,571
Take the remaining silver taels and share them with whoever is left in the manor.

334
00:39:30,571 --> 00:39:36,011
Take your share as well. Tell everyone to go back to their homes; to live well.

335
00:39:36,011 --> 00:39:38,211
Then Wuji Manor…

336
00:39:38,211 --> 00:39:40,811
From now on,

337
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:44,639
in this world, there will no longer be a Wuji Manor.

338
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,771
But... the Yan Family is the number one family in Jianghu.

339
00:39:48,771 --> 00:39:51,680
It's the ancient dilemma of loyalty and justice.
(T/N: one can't serve both in the court and in Jianghu)

340
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:56,100
As great as a family is, it cannot defeat a country.

341
00:39:56,100 --> 00:40:00,450
[Wuji Manor]

342
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:14,151
Now that war is on the way. My path is no longer in Jianghu.

343
00:40:14,151 --> 00:40:16,460
Instead, it's on the battlefield.

344
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:21,131
I am a descendent of the Yan Family, even more so a citizen of Shuo.

345
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:26,391
What I have to protect, isn't just Wuji Manor,

346
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,591
but also the people of the country.

347
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:47,200
[Wuji Manor]

348
00:40:51,000 --> 00:41:01,580
[Wuji Manor]

349
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:26,731
In this world, someone always needs to be the hero.

350
00:41:26,731 --> 00:41:30,131
Not only me, but you have to as well.

351
00:41:30,131 --> 00:41:34,931
Zhao Xifan can show mercy. Yan Xifan can't.

352
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:40,651
Father, I will prove to you.

353
00:41:40,651 --> 00:41:45,071
What Yan Xifan can't do, Zhao Xifan can.

354
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:16,679
Once the war starts, this will be the weakest part of the wall. Take some people with you to go reinforce it.

355
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:21,759
General, the Dan Army is gathering. This time they have Xidan supporting them from behind.

356
00:42:21,759 --> 00:42:27,439
Now that Wuji Manor has been destroyed, most of the people from Jianghu have left.

357
00:42:27,439 --> 00:42:30,551
I'm afraid we won't be able to defend it.

358
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:37,511
I have written to His Majesty for reinforcements. I just hope it comes in time.

359
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,780
General.

360
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:46,299
I'm Yan Xifan, a general conferred by His Majesty. Here to report for duty.

361

362
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:10,590
♫ Waiting to be buried by the lake in the town, ♫

363
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:16,640
♫ the White Paper Boat drifting with sorrow ♫

364
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:22,520
♫ Lights on the other side of the sea ♫

365
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:30,070
♫ punched fingertips in the red water tower ♫

366
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:40,610
♫ Watch the little boat churning, laughing at the ordinariness ♫

367
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:44,930
♫ Like a kite being pulled into a low altitude, ♫

368
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:50,250
♫ I smiled to the leaving person ♫

369
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:54,690
♫ The more spotlight, the more vivid the story ♫

370
00:43:54,690 --> 00:43:59,550
♫ Laughing like the moon, ♫

371
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:04,040
♫ regretting the lighthouse broke in the waves, ♫

372
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:11,900
♫ I call the Milky Way that isolates us all, blue ♫

373
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:18,780
♫ Like a moat built under the sea, ♫

374
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:23,610
♫ waiting for the words on the paper boat to disappear, ♫

375
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:31,740
♫ there must always be someone who doesn’t
remember listening to the other ♫

376
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:38,300
♫ Anyone who is correctly guessed will end in disfavor ♫

377
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:42,400
♫ You are particularly touched but others consider it ordinary ♫

378
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:47,770
♫ Like the author, roughly put down with a weak stroke, ♫

379
00:44:47,770 --> 00:44:52,340
♫ the writing boat on the lake was just like
a paper crane in the air ♫

380
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:57,050
♫ Laughing like the moon, ♫

381
00:44:57,050 --> 00:45:01,670
♫ regretting the lighthouse broke in the waves, ♫

♫ I call the Milky Way that isolates us all, blue ♫

383
00:45:11,470 --> 00:45:16,640
♫ Can a moat be built on the seabed? ♫

384
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:20,920
♫ Wipe all the words on the paper boat! ♫

385
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:28,270
♫ Please let someone not remember and don't tell another! ♫

386
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:35,480
♫ Hide the reluctance between words ♫

387
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:40,120
♫ Unfortunately, I (you) am (are) an average author ♫

388
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:47,590
♫ No matter how you (I) describe the rest, it's unnecessary! ♫

389
00:45:49,810 --> 00:45:58,560
♫ Don't describe my unfulfilled promise! ♫

390
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:07,420
♫ Don't interpret my hidden fire-smoke! ♫

391
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:16,350
♫ Don't let the paper boat in the rough wave chasing me! ♫
