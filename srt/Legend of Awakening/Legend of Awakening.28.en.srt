00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,950
♫ The dark green sea is hazy ♫

3
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:32,760
♫ dissipating in a flash. ♫

4
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:36,700
♫ Rivers and lakes divide the world. ♫

5
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,970
♫ Ten thousands arrows are firing at once. ♫

6
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:44,000
♫ Who has time to worry? Who loves the color of blood? ♫

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,820
♫ At that time, spirits are high. ♫

8
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,620
♫ Who calls the world his home? Who dares let his horse freely run? ♫

9
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:54,400
♫ Silently, tears form in the death of night. ♫

10
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,260
♫ Heroes are cutting all ties, ♫

11
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,080
♫ giving up whether it's life or death, ♫

12
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,300
♫ never asking what the cost is. ♫

13
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:09,860
♫ Good and evil must be distinguished. ♫

14
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:13,760
♫ The wind blows off the snow. ♫

15
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,600
♫ On the body, etch multiple scars, ♫

16
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,760
♫ wandering all over the world, ♫

17
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:25,200
♫ only wish to ask for answers from this world. ♫

18
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,260
♫ A teenager doesn't have to be a hero. ♫

19
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:33,100
♫ There is no need for flowers in the dream. ♫

20

00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:22,600
[Episode 28]

29
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:28,310
First, the real master of the Mountain and Sea Gang who appeared last time, is Liu Song.

30
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:31,940
He was once a disciple of Big Dipper, as well as a descendant of the Royal in Hedong.

31
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:36,731
Whether the gang is related to the court or if they have other plans,

32
00:02:36,731 --> 00:02:38,871
right now, we still don't know.

33
00:02:38,871 --> 00:02:42,339
The Big Dipper, along with other sects in the pugilist world, want to eliminate such a devil.

34
00:02:42,339 --> 00:02:46,431
When it comes to political affairs though, the Big Dipper doesn't want to interfere.

35
00:02:46,431 --> 00:02:50,059
I am here to share these things as well as send our invitation to the Seven Star Convention.

36
00:02:50,059 --> 00:02:52,411
I hope General will be prepared.

37
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,970
Exactly what kind of surprise is it?

38
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,210
He was so mysterious.

39
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,611
His Majesty has already guessed this.

40
00:03:06,611 --> 00:03:10,651
I will report the details and discuss it with him.

41
00:03:10,651 --> 00:03:12,220
General,

42
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:15,260
I still have one more thing.

43
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:27,520
General Qin, I am asking to

44
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,100
marry Qin Sang.

45
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,350
General, I hope you'll allow me to.

46
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:43,180
How dare you! I can see that you really need to be beaten.

47
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:50,971
You ask for marriage without bringing anything except your sincerity?

48
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,220
My parents died when I was little.

49
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,730
I don't really understand the etiquette.

50
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,110
Even if I bring gifts,

51
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:07,650
I'm afraid being from a noble family, you'd look down on them.

52
00:04:07,651 --> 00:04:10,031
I have only my sincerity.

53
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,351
General, I still hope you'll allow it.

54
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,511
What you said is not sincere.

55
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,350
General Qin,

56
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,260
It was because I almost lost Qin Sang this time that I understood

57
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:35,411
how lucky I was,

58
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,371
to have her beside me all those days before.

59
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,251
Life is full of accidents,

60
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:49,491
I hope she can be carefree

61
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,151
and I also always want to be by her side.

62
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,240
Lu Ping, let me ask you.

63
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,051
Do you have an answer to the question I asked you?

64
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,240
Qin Sang's happiness,

65
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,390
I think I don't have to exchange my identity for it.

66
00:05:09,391 --> 00:05:12,351
What do you mean by that?

67
00:05:12,351 --> 00:05:15,539
Sang're is my sister and the daughter of the Qin Family.

68
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,251
Her marriage is not a joke.

69
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:22,131
Will she have to be homeless like you for the rest of her life?

70
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:29,879
Brother, I would rather be with him in the pugilist world than be a lady imprisoned in her room.

71
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:32,871
Sang'er, you… What a mess it is!

72
00:05:32,871 --> 00:05:35,111
Utterly nonsense!

73
00:05:35,111 --> 00:05:39,979
General Qin, I'm telling you the information, not to help you.

74
00:05:39,979 --> 00:05:41,930
I can promise you only one thing.

75
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:45,330
That is I will be with Qin Sang for the rest of our lives

76
00:05:45,339 --> 00:05:47,331
and never let her get hurt again.

77
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:52,350
Get out! I don't need you to protect my sister.

78
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:54,511
Let her go!

79
00:05:54,511 --> 00:05:56,771
Are you going to agree or not?

80
00:05:56,771 --> 00:05:58,551
I don't!

81
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,291
Brother…

82
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,111
I am going to go see His Majesty.

83
00:06:14,111 --> 00:06:19,339
With the enemy blocking our way, we will talk later after dealing with the Mountain and Sea Gang.

84
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:29,091
Wen Rui, didn't the doctor say that Miss

85
00:06:29,091 --> 00:06:34,251
shouldn't stay at home but should go out

86
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,980
to improve her recovery?

87
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,511
Yes, yes, yes.

88
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:43,079
Should I take Miss out now?

89
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,731
You just come with me!

90
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:00,799
Proposal? How dare you!

91
00:07:00,799 --> 00:07:05,719
If I don't have a reasonable identity, I will be tortured by Wen Rui every time I come.

92
00:07:05,719 --> 00:07:07,671
Can you stand it?

93
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:13,331
But my brother's rejected it, will you still continue to propose?

94
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,531
When have I ever given up?

95
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:21,900
But I have to finish the task your brother has given me first.

96
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:27,171
Where would the lady like to go today?

97
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,091
Chenqiao Town.

98
00:07:32,091 --> 00:07:33,431
Let's go.

99
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,620
Your Majesty.

100
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:50,150
I am just surprised that the Mountain and Sea Gang

101
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:54,310
is related to what happened with the Big Dipper so long ago.

102
00:07:54,311 --> 00:07:58,191
They've been planning since then.

103
00:07:58,191 --> 00:08:00,551
I can help but feel a chill in my bones.

104
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:04,740
Your Majesty, now that Liu Song has shown himself,

105
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:09,691
it means that the Mountain and Sea Gang will be more obvious in their actions.

106
00:08:09,691 --> 00:08:14,340
What makes it difficult is that the Mountain and Sea Gang is a sect in the pugilist world.

107
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:17,191
I can't take my army to search Dan State.

108
00:08:17,191 --> 00:08:20,340
We can't take the initiative, and can only wait and see.

109
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:24,351
Affairs in the pugilist world can only be ended in the pugilist world.

110
00:08:24,351 --> 00:08:26,371
What you mean is…

111
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:33,430
Xia Bojian, since he came back from Yuezhou,

112
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,710
has criticized you several times,

113
00:08:35,711 --> 00:08:40,801
saying you valued the criminal who killed an official and disobeyed the law.

114
00:08:40,801 --> 00:08:42,591
Is this true?

115
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:46,431
I deserve a death penalty.

116
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,351
Get up and explain it clearly!

117
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:57,420
Your Majesty, Wen Gecheng was the Master of the Wind Division in the Mountain and Sea Gang.

118
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,300
It happened suddenly.

119
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,330
In order to stabilize the overall situation

120
00:09:01,331 --> 00:09:03,910
and uphold your majesty's national policy of selecting the best,

121
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,940
I concealed the truth in a hurry.

122
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:09,119
I framed Lu Ping.

123
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:12,260
His sect was also destroyed because of it.

124
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,791
I have always felt sorry for him.

125
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:19,271
Since Your Majesty already knows,

126
00:09:19,271 --> 00:09:24,951
may I beg Your Majesty to only punish me and stop asking about it?

127
00:09:24,951 --> 00:09:27,971
We can't hurt his loyalty for the country.

128
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,260
You mentioned Lu Ping.

129
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:36,851
- Was he the winner of the Pneuma Combat Convention?
- Indeed!

130
00:09:36,851 --> 00:09:40,600
He is the son of the previous pavilion master of the Big Dipper, Leng Xiutan.

131
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,660
Your Majesty, thanks to his help, we were able to stop the Mountain and Sea Gang's plan

132
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:47,300
during the peace talk in Yuezhou.

133
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:50,719
Do you think if we can use him as our bridge

134
00:09:50,719 --> 00:09:54,799
to cooperate with the Big Dipper and other sects, and have them march in the front in

135
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:57,180
the war against the Mountain and Sea Gang?

136
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:00,111
Your Majesty is wise. However,...

137
00:10:00,111 --> 00:10:01,651
However, what?

138
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,440
I have invited him several times

139
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,270
but he still won't agree to come.

140
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:18,231
Qin Qi, you are good at military actions but

141
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:25,191
when it comes to dealing with people, you could use some more years of experience.

142
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,971
You indeed should be punished.

143
00:10:29,971 --> 00:10:33,210
But as I can see,

144
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:35,530
this still has some use.

145
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,699
- This necklace is beautiful.
- Yes, it suits you.

146
00:10:46,699 --> 00:10:48,400
Let's go!

147
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:57,111
These are all this year's new trends.

148
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,731
Does it look nice?

149
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,700
Young lad, your wife is asking you!

150
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,600
Why don't you buy her one?

151
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,011
It doesn't suit you.

152
00:11:22,011 --> 00:11:23,590
What do you mean?

153
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:25,410
Go. Go. Go.

154
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:35,579
Why are you so stingy? Is it because you can't bear to spend money on me?

155
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:38,300
Look! I initially prepared it as my betrothal present.

156
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:41,819
I was afraid your brother would want it so I didn't take it out.

157
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,831
This is just an ordinary sword, isn't it?

158
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,919
It might look ordinary but I got it from the Seven Martyr Court.

159
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:04,071
What is this?

160
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,439
This? It is a Bodhi fruit.

161
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:12,951
It took me some effort to find it.

162
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,271
It will bless you and keep you safe.

163

Qin Sang, no matter what happens in the future,

164
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,051
I just want you to be safe.

Thank you, Lu Ping.

166
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:44,030
I will carry it for the rest of my life.

167
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,801
It also has another name.

169
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,499

Sadly, I haven't believed in these things since childhood.

Maybe it is because my wishes back then were never realized.

186

I understand after being disappointed many times,

I wish my brother would agree that—

Shut up! You dare to steal my light?

And now, so quickly, you're...

It's because that first time we met, I hung her up on a tree.

So impressive and so special!

213

Lu Ping, is it because I got hurt

218
00:17:26,131 --> 00:17:29,080
- that you quarreled with Xifan?
- It's all right.

219
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:33,319
He found his father so he went back home to be a young master.

I was so happy, I even forgot to ask you

223
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,751
what you plan to do next.

224
00:17:52,751 --> 00:17:55,420
About being an official that my brother asked,

225
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,180
what do you think?

226
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,500
I thought a lot after the peace talk.

227
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:06,051
I felt great satisfaction when seeing people safe.

228
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,680
I thought about agreeing to what your brother's suggest.

229
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:12,851
It just that... I have always been free.

230
00:18:12,851 --> 00:18:16,471
I am afraid it would be worse if I was to be restrained.

231

Moreover, your brother doesn't have a say in this.

Emperor? You are even making friends with the emperor?

234
00:18:24,879 --> 00:18:30,340
Lu Ping, can you ask him to give me a board with gold characters?

235
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:35,140
This way, it would be easier for me to earn more money.

236
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,740
Boss Jin, do you really need it?

237
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:41,319
- Aren't you, yourself, that gold board for Ruyu Restaurant?
- Of course, I need it.

238
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:45,891
By the order of His Majesty, Ruyu Restaurant is awarded a board.

but it is not appropriate for me to do so.

I heard the Big Dipper gathered various sects in the pugilist world

to fight against the Mountain and Sea Gang.

to be the bridge linking me and the pugilist world.

You can help us cooperate and

269
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,271
help end the disaster.

00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,711
Why me?

271
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:58,311
Didn't you do very well during the peace talk in Yuezhou?

272
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,440
Last time when I took part in the convention,

my sect was destroyed.

He made the crime of cheating me.

279
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,230
He should be sentenced to decapitation.

280

Exchange contributions for mistakes.

282
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:39,291
Then let me give him the punishment of 100 canes.

283
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:43,291
However, you have to carry out the punishment.

284
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:45,690
Your Majesty, you've had this planned out well.

How can I beat Qin Sang's brother?

Didn't I say, this was up to you?

287
00:22:53,531 --> 00:22:57,700
I never knew what you were thinking at the Pneuma Combat Convention.

288
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:01,051
I originally thought that my master was like a sly fox.

Who knew that Your Majesty would be so similar.

Lu Ping, don't be rude!

291

If you say one more word, I really will beat you.

292
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,220
This is settled then.

293
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,990
I will go to the Big Dipper myself.

294

For one thing, I appreciate their help in Yuezhou.

For another, I will ask for their cooperation.

Master,

297
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,960
I will do what I think is right.

298
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,740
I hope, I will live up to your expectations.

Please bless and protect me.

Lu Ping, I'm telling you,

301
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,871
if you dare to beat my brother, I… will hang you on a tree.

302
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:18,391
It looks like I am still a stranger after all.

- I'm fine.
- Did that little thief show off in front of you?

306
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:38,939
I thought about it! It won't hurt doing His Majesty a favor.

307
00:24:38,939 --> 00:24:40,520
Less with the nonsense.

308
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,510
Get prepared! We'll set off at daybreak.

309
00:24:43,511 --> 00:24:45,251
Go where?

310
00:24:45,251 --> 00:24:47,191
The Big Dipper Academy.

311
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:59,939
Who set fire in the Seven Martyr Court? There's smoke everywhere.

312
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:03,191
Elder, time for lunch.

313
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,951
What dishes?

314
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:32,351
Master, I'll just taste them for you.

315
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,990
Have you finished practicing?

316
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:39,060
Go on if you haven't.

317
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:00,879
Have a sip of the soup. If you don't like it, I will cook something else.

318
00:26:00,879 --> 00:26:05,460
I might look like Guo Youdao but I am not your master.

319
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,811
You don't have to serve me like this.

320
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:12,940
Truthfully, I never served master before like this, either.

321
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:15,050
Now, it's too late to regret it.

322
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:17,170
You are the twin brother of my master.

323
00:26:17,179 --> 00:26:21,131
Serving you is the same as serving him.

324
00:26:21,131 --> 00:26:24,380
Just give me a chance to make up for it.

325
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:26,891
Do you want to make up for it

326
00:26:26,891 --> 00:26:29,690
or do you want to have something to do

327
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:31,950
so that you won't think too much?

328
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,320
If you finish eating,

329
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:46,840
then go and practice martial arts with Tianqi.

330
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,580
Since you regard me as your master,

331
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:53,510
then I must do something.

332
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:56,220
Teaching you martial arts is to show you that

333
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,580
although I look like Guo Youdao,

334
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:01,910
when it comes to skill and teaching,

335
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:04,330
he's nothing compared to me.

336
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,120
Also,

337
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,791
rest for a bit after practicing.

338
00:27:11,791 --> 00:27:16,591
The longer you practice, the less you'll have to think about.

339
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:22,231
Don't ruin my Seven Martyr Court anymore.

340
00:27:22,231 --> 00:27:24,971
Yes. Thank you, Elder.

341
00:27:24,971 --> 00:27:27,091
The one who's standing by the threshold,

342
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,431
are you going to come out on your own

343
00:27:30,431 --> 00:27:33,651
or do I need to drag you out myself?

344
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,800
No, no, no! Elder, please teach me what you have in mind,

345
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,610
but just don't do that.

346
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,880
What are you doing here?

347
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,940
Master, you have been ignored me for a long time.

348
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:54,500
I found an interesting place behind the mountain.

349
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,750
Would you like to go there with me this afternoon?

350
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:59,411
I have to practice skills from Elder Guo in the afternoon.

351
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,759
Then… It is good to enjoy the scenery in the evening.

352
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,591
I have to cook for Elder in the evening.

353
00:28:05,591 --> 00:28:08,919
Actually, we can go tomorrow.

354
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,891
She needs to practice tomorrow, too.

355
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:17,240
Seven Martyr Court doesn't welcome strangers.

356
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:20,110
If you've finished your questions, leave immediately.

357
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,499
Old thing! Ruined my plan.

358
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,671
What did you say?

359
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,491
He seems to be your friend.

360
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,691
One of my best friends.

361
00:28:48,691 --> 00:28:52,410
It just that, in the past, because of someone,

362
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:54,450
I misunderstood him.

363
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:59,889
I feel guilty so I can't stand his kindness.

364
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,439
Elder, may I serve you while you eat?

365
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,519
No need! Go and take care of Chu Min.

366
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,551
When I see you, I get annoyed.

367
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:17,191
Not one of Guo Youdao's disciples is well-behaved.

368
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:28,350
Ziyan, it's been a long time since the Big Dipper welcomed these many guests.

369
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,330
This time, they've even invited many sects.

370
00:29:30,339 --> 00:29:34,519
There aren't enough disciples so inevitably, there's been some confusions.

371
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:36,571
We can only ask for your help.

372
00:29:36,571 --> 00:29:39,660
It's my honor to help you, Young Master Xifan.

373
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:43,880
It'll be busy during the Seven Star Convention so please have enough rest.

374
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,511
Otherwise, I will worry about you.

375
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:50,979
Eldest Senior! Eldest Senior.

376
00:29:50,979 --> 00:29:54,131
I'm in an emergency, so serious.

377
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:00,719
Su Tang won't see you? How is this something serious?

378
00:30:00,719 --> 00:30:02,520
How is it not serious?

379
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:05,450
It took so long for our boss to court Qin Sang.

380
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:10,311
Look! You've only hurt yourself and Miss Ling already come to look after you.

381
00:30:10,311 --> 00:30:12,291
You must have some secret skill!

382
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:18,200
Nonsense! Don't ruin Miss Ling's reputation or I will ask Su Tang to beat you.

383
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,751
Su Tang hasn't beaten me for a long time already.

384
00:30:22,751 --> 00:30:24,779
Just now, she even treated me like a stranger.

385
00:30:24,779 --> 00:30:29,680
Do you think she is angry because of Xu Weifeng?

386
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:34,431
If she continues like this, what should I do?

387
00:30:34,431 --> 00:30:37,439
Su Tang was mistreated because she was young.

388
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,019
But she's always clever, she'll know what is right.

389
00:30:41,019 --> 00:30:43,799
The whole time you've been together, everyone can tell

390
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:45,959
that the two of you have a good relationship.

391
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:49,819
Therefore, when she solves her own problems, she will treat you like before.

392
00:30:49,819 --> 00:30:52,451
How long do I need to wait?

393
00:30:52,451 --> 00:30:54,919
When I see her like this, it makes me so sad.

394
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:56,780
I'm not asking her to treat me well.

395
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:59,920
I just want her to be like before, a carefree girl

396
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,150
who was always beating me up, Su Tang.

397
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:07,079
You know that, sometimes, there is no need of a trick to win.

398
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,519
Instead of going in circles, why don't you just face it head on?

399
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,899
Find a good time and talk it through all at once.

400
00:31:11,899 --> 00:31:14,671
It might be the best and fastest way to get things figured out.

401
00:31:14,671 --> 00:31:18,111
What if I fail and she never want to see me again?

402
00:31:18,111 --> 00:31:20,379
Are you really that unconfident in yourself and in her?

403
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:22,239
I have told you what to do already.

404
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,311
It's up to you if you're going to apply it.

405
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,879
Why is it so quiet inside?

406
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,919
Master Chu Min drinks every day, she wouldn't have drank herself to death, would she?

407
00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:48,310
It can't be! Death has a smell, you'd smell it immediately.

408
00:31:49,089 --> 00:31:52,371
Senior, that is…

409
00:31:52,371 --> 00:31:55,439
You haven't told us what happened to them that year.

410
00:31:55,439 --> 00:32:00,159
Yes, yes, yes! I just told you the sweet story, now, it's time for the sad one.

411
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:06,359
They were a well-matched couple who were envied by many people.

412
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:09,679
Who would've thought? Chu Min was down the mountain when it happened.

413
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:13,180
She heard Liu Song died and was so sad

414
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:16,830
that she lost two Pneumas.

415
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:22,179
- And now, after so many years, it is said that Liu Song is behind the Mountain and Sea Gang.
- White.

416
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,559
This is a story with thousands of ups and downs.

417
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:29,031
Viewers burst into tears and listeners get heartbroken.

418
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:32,391
Senior, duck your head!

419
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,679
Have you finished?

420
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:45,331
Believe it or not? I'll cook the rabbit to eat with my wine.

421
00:32:45,331 --> 00:32:46,709
I will cook for you right now.

422
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:48,651
Go! Go! Go!

423
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,451
Master, don't make it hard for them.

424
00:33:05,451 --> 00:33:06,930
I brought you some dishes.

425
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:10,270
My brother isn't here so I shall keep you company.

426
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,391
I'll drink with you.

427
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,599
It's normal for me to have things on my mind.

428
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,620
You, little girl,

429
00:33:41,431 --> 00:33:44,151
why are you so worried?

430
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:50,071
You are in front of your master and you still refuse to tell the truth?

431
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:55,020
I know that

432
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,710
my brother left me here

433
00:33:59,211 --> 00:34:01,431
for my own good.

434
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:04,471
And Mo Lin,

435
00:34:04,471 --> 00:34:07,271
he always tries everything to make me happy.

436
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:11,441
But I can't be happy.

437
00:34:11,441 --> 00:34:14,491
Whenever my brother is out there on his own,

438
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:17,779
I always feel like I can't do anything to help.

439
00:34:17,779 --> 00:34:22,431
The more peaceful it is here and the better everyone treats me,

440
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,591
the more upset I feel.

441
00:34:25,591 --> 00:34:29,111
Even though my brother says that everything is in the past now,

442
00:34:29,111 --> 00:34:31,421
in my heart, I can't get past it.

443
00:34:31,421 --> 00:34:36,151
Had it not been for my mistake back then,

444
00:34:36,151 --> 00:34:38,711
to believe Xu Weifeng,

445
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:45,141
then my brother... wouldn't have gone through all that.

446
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:56,071
It is enough for me to be sad.

447
00:34:56,071 --> 00:34:58,191
You don't have to be.

448
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,171
You are still young.

449
00:35:08,171 --> 00:35:11,111
You didn't cause any major trouble.

450
00:35:11,111 --> 00:35:13,791
Just be careful from now on.

451
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:19,059
- Then Master, you, too—
- Stop worrying about me.

452
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,129
Mind the one outside first.

453
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:29,410
- Who?
- Help!

454
00:35:30,129 --> 00:35:32,351
Help!

455
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:38,370
Which one of you will come and fight against me?

456
00:35:38,971 --> 00:35:44,069
- Master.
- Little White, I had initially thought about catching a female rabbit to be your wife.

457
00:35:44,069 --> 00:35:47,251
Surprisingly, we got a big mouse instead.

458
00:35:47,251 --> 00:35:49,019
What do you mean, who's a big mouse?

459
00:35:49,019 --> 00:35:51,299
Master, they bully me.

460
00:35:51,299 --> 00:35:53,991
Do you think I look like a big mouse?

461
00:35:53,991 --> 00:35:55,751
Do I?

462
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,351
Master, you finally smiled.

463
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:09,119
Master, who did you learn that skill from? So amazing!

464
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:11,199
Even the World's No.1 Assassin can't catch you.

465
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,619
I told you earlier that I learned it from Master Guo.

466
00:36:13,619 --> 00:36:15,840
Why would I lie to you?

467
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:19,039
Little Shepherd, you're not just a big mouse,

468
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:21,239
but even a single one at that.

469
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,239
Is that right, Little White?

470
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,271
Go! Go! Go!

471
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:30,739
Master, actually, I came because I have something serious to tell you.

472
00:36:30,739 --> 00:36:33,259
Master Chu Min has been sad lately.

473
00:36:33,259 --> 00:36:37,351
Thus, I want to go down the mountain to buy her a gift to make her happy.

474
00:36:37,351 --> 00:36:41,079
You know her better than me so can you go with me down the mountain?

475
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:43,311
You can offer me some advice.

476
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,070
Your Majesty,

477
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:07,820
I will go up first thing tomorrow morning to inform the pavilion master.

478
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:11,071
When he's agreed, then I'll take you up there.

479
00:37:11,071 --> 00:37:15,371
Why is there only meat and no wine?

480
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,080
- Bring some wine!
- Yes.

481
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,719
Your Majesty, you have a high status.

482
00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:25,411
It would be inappropriate to eat with ordinary people.

483
00:37:25,411 --> 00:37:29,271
Qin Qi, you are seriously too rigid.

484
00:37:29,271 --> 00:37:31,959
No wonder when I bestow on you a marriage,

485
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,290
those young ladies, when they hear that they might marry you,

486
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:37,090
they would all rather die instead.

487
00:37:37,091 --> 00:37:38,699
- Come! Have a seat!
- Your Majesty.

488
00:37:38,699 --> 00:37:42,380
- Yes.
- You're giving Lu Ping such honor is even more than any of the officials.

489
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:51,711
This reminds me of my past.

490
00:37:51,711 --> 00:37:56,390
When I was young, I marched everywhere with my father.

491
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:59,109
Every night, we were just like this.

492
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,779
We drank around the camp fire.

493
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,931
It was really happy and fun.

494
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:10,581
But now, I am at the age my father was at that time,

495
00:38:10,581 --> 00:38:14,791
and the Mountain and Sea Gang is still threatening Shuo.

496
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,531
I feel so ashamed.

497
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,691
There's no need for Your Majesty to be so humble.

498
00:38:22,691 --> 00:38:27,239
I have seen in Chenqiao Town, people are living a better life now.

499
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:29,871
When the Mountain and Sea Gang is eliminated,

500
00:38:29,871 --> 00:38:33,091
may Your Majesty remember your original goals.

501
00:38:33,091 --> 00:38:37,439
Of course, prosperity and peace are the foundations of the country.

502
00:38:37,439 --> 00:38:39,239
They are also the foundations of Shuo.

503
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:43,501
If I forget them, wouldn't be like I destroy my own foundations.

504
00:38:43,501 --> 00:38:46,190
Then, how could I face my father

505
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:49,010
and the sacrifices of those dead soldiers?

506
00:38:49,011 --> 00:38:52,540
After the elimination of the Mountain and Sea Gang, what will you do?

507
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:56,699
I will develop the economy and build up diplomatic relationships with other states.

508
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:00,351
I believe that one day

509
00:39:00,351 --> 00:39:04,971
I will bring peace to the world.

510
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:11,051
If you succeed, people will be lucky to have you.

511
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,631
I thank you on behalf of them.

512
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:21,960
Looking at you, I feel like

513
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,370
you're my younger brother.

514
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:29,091
We are lucky to have you helping us.

515
00:39:29,091 --> 00:39:32,911
It should be toasting you on behalf of everyone.

516
00:39:32,911 --> 00:39:35,451
Okay! At that time,

517
00:39:35,451 --> 00:39:39,360
I will drink with you again to celebrate, Brother.

518
00:39:40,011 --> 00:39:43,520
Lu Ping, mind yourself!

519
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:48,310
Don't be so rigid!

520
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:51,011
People in the pugilist world don't care about these things.

521
00:39:51,011 --> 00:39:54,779
We are not in the palace, pour me some wine!

522
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,251
Yes.

523
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,899
Why didn't you stay well at your camp?

524
00:40:29,899 --> 00:40:32,200
Aren't you afraid to be seen by your brother?

525
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,251
I saw everything just now.

526
00:40:43,251 --> 00:40:45,620
Don't blame my brother!

527
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:50,099
He is in charge of the emperor's safety, he has to be very careful.

528
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:56,411
As expected, I don't have good manners.

529
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,920
If he's always like this in the future,

530
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,970
then my life will really be hard.

531
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:14,659
Stop talking nonsense! My brother hasn't agreed yet.

532
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:21,939
With his highly skills in martial arts, he surely can stop me now.

533
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:24,010
However, after I break my Pneuma Confinement,

534
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:26,990
he won't be able to beat or catch me.

535
00:41:26,991 --> 00:41:29,491
Then we can live our carefree lives by ourselves.

536
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,850
[Big Dipper Pavilion]

537
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:09,199
This is my son, Yan Xifan.

538
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,791
- Greeting Elders.
- Young Master Xifan.

539
00:42:12,791 --> 00:42:15,729
Young Master Xifan is chivalrous. Such a handsome man!

540
00:42:15,729 --> 00:42:18,799
- Master, you are blessed.
- Yes.

541
00:42:18,799 --> 00:42:22,000
Xifan, during the Seven Star Convention,

542
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,891
you have to get close to the masters of all sects.

543
00:42:24,891 --> 00:42:28,319
I ask everyone to please help him in the future.

544
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:31,411
- It is our pleasure.
- It's what we should do.

545
00:42:31,411 --> 00:42:35,699
This isn't Wuji Manor! Who's he pretending to be the host for?

546
00:42:35,699 --> 00:42:39,451
- Is he really regarding the Big Dipper as his home?
- Exactly!

547
00:42:39,451 --> 00:42:42,819
So strange! He was initially one of the seven peak masters of the Big Dipper.

548
00:42:42,819 --> 00:42:45,059
After the Seven Star incident that year, he left and started his own sect.

549
00:42:45,059 --> 00:42:47,439
This means he obviously has nothing to do with the Big Dipper.

550
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:51,751
Furthermore, no matter how much I search, I can't find the reason why he left.

551
00:42:51,751 --> 00:42:54,990
He really doesn't have any sense of shame.

552
00:42:56,980 --> 00:43:00,039
Isn't that Lu Ping? Lu Ping!

553
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:09,371
Hurry and escort the masters inside.

554
00:43:09,371 --> 00:43:12,919
- This way, please!
- After you!

555
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:38,200

♫ Watch the little boat churning, laughing at the ordinariness. ♫

561
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:18,580
♫ Like a kite being pulled into a low altitude, ♫

♫ regretting the lighthouse broke in the waves, ♫

566

♫ I call the Milky Way that isolates us all, blue. ♫
