00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:28,930
♫ The dark green sea is hazy ♫

3
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:32,790
♫ dissipating in a flash ♫

4
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,630
♫ Rivers and lakes divide the world ♫

5
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,990
♫ Ten thousands arrows are firing at once ♫

6
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:44,020
♫ Who has time to worry? Who loves the color of blood? ♫

7
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:47,830
♫ At that time, spirits are high ♫

8
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:51,660
♫ Who calls the world his home? Who dares let his horse freely run? ♫

9
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,340
♫ Silently, tears form in the death of night ♫

10
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:58,230
♫ Heroes are cutting all ties, ♫

11
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,110
♫ giving up whether it's life or death, ♫

12
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:04,270
♫ never asking what the cost is ♫

13
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:09,800
♫ Good and evil must be distinguished ♫

14
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,760
♫ The wind blows off the snow ♫

15
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,540
♫ On the body, etch multiple scars, ♫

16
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,700
♫ wandering all over the world, ♫

17
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:25,110
♫ only wish to ask for answers from this world ♫

18
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:29,160
♫ A teenager doesn't have to be a hero ♫

19
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:33,090
♫ There is no need for flowers in the dream ♫

20
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,230
♫ Destiny need not be afraid ♫

21
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:40,660
♫ Because you have him all the way, ♫

[Episode 40]

29
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,340
So this is what a flower looks like?

30
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,919
I have been in the Mountain and Sea Gang for as long as I can remember.

31
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,959
I've never seen them before.

32
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,799
After we get out, let's find a place.

33
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,220
I'll plant a whole lot of flowers for you.

34
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,539
We'll live happily together.

35
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:44,400
Then can we plant osmanthus?

36
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,299
Prisoners that the gang brought back told me there's osmanthus candy we can eat out there.

37
00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:51,140
I don't even know what candy is.

38
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,920
It is sweet.

39
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,840
Sweet?

40
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,560
Su Tang, have you noticed?

41
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,320
You're here and there are flowers here too.

42
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,460
The life I wanted when I was a child...

43
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,880
is right in front of me now.

44
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,520
Brother.

45
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,140
I made up my mind.

46
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,560
I would rather not break the lock

47
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,800
than be used by Liu Song.

48
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:26,740
If I stay here, in this remote Carefree Valley,

49
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,180
then everyone can live in peace.

50
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,440
I can also live longer.

51
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,620
Why not then?

52
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:39,840
Brother, then... what about Miss Qin?

53
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,200
Don't you want to be with her?

54
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,320
If I had known that the last time I would see her was at Wuji Manor,

55
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,320
I wouldn't have gotten in such a terrible fight with her.

56
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,239
At this point, there's no opportunity to go back anyway.

57
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,060
Why not write her a letter?

58
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,200
At least let her know where you are.

59
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,780
If there's an opportunity and things change, then maybe you can meet again.

60
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,120
Since I've decided to stay here,

61
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,280
why not let her forget about me completely.

62
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,660
Everything we experienced together,

63
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:18,480
I'll keep as memories in my heart.

64
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,880
Being able to think back on them once in awhile,

65
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,760
is pretty good, too.

66
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:31,279
Since you've made your decision, Mo Lin and I will stay with you. We won't go anywhere.

67
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:34,819
Let's bathe in the sunshine and raise flowers every day. How about it?

68
00:04:34,819 --> 00:04:37,360
You and Mo Lin?

69
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,939
- You guys...
- I…

70
00:04:40,939 --> 00:04:44,400
I… He keeps bothering me.

71
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,460
I don't know how to answer him yet.

72
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,760
What does your heart tell you?

73
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,220
I was stupid about it before.

74
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,800
Actually, he....

75
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,680
is quite cute.

76
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,160
Su Tang,

77
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,380
you have gone through too many ups and downs with me.

78
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:10,620
How that little assassin has treated you, I've noticed all of it.

79
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,760
Life is short.

80
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,180
When you've met someone who treats you wholeheartedly,

81
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,760
then you shouldn't keep waiting.

82
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,900
I should have studied more medical books when I was younger.

83
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:48,119
Now I can't save my brother, I can't help my sister, and I can't get married either.

84
00:05:48,119 --> 00:05:50,000
I am such a waste.

85
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,400
Go away. Stop bothering me!

86
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,640
If you keep scratching your hair like that you'll end up bald.

87
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,019
Master, why are you back so late?

88
00:06:12,019 --> 00:06:15,359
Be careful.Don't catch a cold! Hurry up and go back.

89
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,520
I have something to tell you.

90
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,220
Master.

91
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,720
I…

92
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,519
My brother says he doesn't plan to break the lock

93
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,540
and he doesn't plan to leave anymore.

94
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:51,160
You don't have to think so hard on it anymore.

95
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,340
Understood.

96
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,400
Anything else?

97
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,440
Then... I'm heading back now.

98
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,140
Master,

99
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,100
do you really not have anything else you want to say to me?

100
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,760
You should go back soon and get some rest, too.

101
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,339
Master, are you really stupid or just pretending?

102
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,899
Mo Lin, don't be angry! I'm sorry.

103
00:07:52,899 --> 00:07:56,999
If I say I won't be angry with you if you're willing to marry me, then will you marry me?

Now you also know.

118

It was just that my brother is like my father.

119
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,960
I had to ask for his opinion.

120
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,480
I've agreed to it.

121

Why would I joke?

I'm going to stay in Carefree Valley and raise flowers and herbs.

After thinking about it carefully, I'm just missing a brother-in-law.

I have chased you for so long, Master.

00:10:43,859 --> 00:10:47,040
You will be the most beautiful bride.

134
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,920
Wait for me.

135
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,680
Wait for me!

136
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,999
Brother, look how anxious he is.

137
00:11:01,999 --> 00:11:07,440
But I'm willing to marry him even without the wedding dress.

138
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,880
No way.

139
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:14,980
A girl is the most beautiful in her wedding dress.

140

Like a fire,

that can warm everyone who sees her.

142
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,899
Enough. Go back and get some rest.

143
00:11:28,899 --> 00:11:31,560
Thank Master Mo for me tomorrow.

144
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,860
We will have to bother him a bit more

145
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:37,180
in the future.

146
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,299
Little Mo, have a bite. I'm begging you.

147
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:00,779
Just a bite! Little Mo.

148
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:02,479
I'm begging you to eat.

Little Mo.

150
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,560
Master.

151
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:17,620
Why aren't you working with your brother? What do you want from me?

152
00:12:18,339 --> 00:12:20,320
Master, thank you.

153
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,639
You pay for my treatments through labor.

154
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,279
This is how it's supposed to be.

155
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,300
No need to thank me.

156
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,599
Mo Lin says that Carefree Valley has a lot of people and it's prosperous.

157
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,079
Why would you need a worker like my brother?

158
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:43,959
You did that so my brother would have something to do and so he'd stop thinking about the past.

159
00:12:43,959 --> 00:12:46,720
On behalf of my brother, I thank you.

160
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,959
I tell you! I am not that idle.

161
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,660
I don't care about things like that.

162
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,719
Then, why did you keep eavesdropping yesterday?

163
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,870
Only leaving after you felt assured.

164
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,400
You didn't even wipe off the dirt on your shoes.

165
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,639
My brother stole your candy,

166
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,140
so I prepared you a gift in return.

167
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,220
I tell you.

168
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:18,360
If it wasn't because you saved Little Mo before, I wouldn't have done a thing.

169
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,199
We have everything in this valley.

170
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,820
I don't need your silly, little things.

171
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,599
Just keep them for yourselves.

172
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,300
It's for Little Mo.

173
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,520
I heard birds love earthworms.

174
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,000
That would be great.

175
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,539
You're actually a good man, too.

176
00:13:39,539 --> 00:13:42,799
When Mo Lin becomes the best assassin, I'll urge him to show you more respect and support you.

177
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,120
Impossible.

178
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,519
Master, you're actually quite benevolent.

179
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,239
Why are you being stubborn about this? It's Mo Lin's dream.

180
00:13:50,239 --> 00:13:54,959
Let me tell you! It doesn't matter who comes here, everyone must obey my rules in Carefree Valley.

181
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,759
Everyone. Absolutely not!

182
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,199
Master, there are alarms from the Mist Forest. Someone's trying to get in.

183
00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:07,979
Is it people from the Mountain and Sea Gang?

184
00:14:07,979 --> 00:14:09,599
That is what Mr. Lu thinks as well.

185
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,680
He's gone over there already.

186
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,880
Mountain and Sea Gang.

187
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:54,300
The help you gave me in the Mountain and Sea Gang can be considered repaid now I think.

188
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,080
You look well.

189
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:01,420
Senior, I just knew you would come.

190
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,279
We've missed you during this time.

191
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,000
Now we're all together again!

192
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,039
Lu Ping, we've come under His Majesty's edict,

193
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,160
to take you to Kaifeng.

194
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:17,080
Lu Ping, His Majesty knows that the gang is producing Force Eaters.

195
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,760
He wants to invite you back to discuss it.

196
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,300
I think His Majesty wants to force me back,

197
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,760
to study the Power of Awakening. Right?

198
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,119
Senior Brother, the emperor is my brother's enemy.

199
00:15:30,119 --> 00:15:32,540
How can you listen to his orders?

200
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,860
Don't you know?

201
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:39,460
My brother's parents put the Pneuma Confinement on him in order to save his life.

202
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:43,520
If we break the last lock, he will die.

203
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,020
Is it true?

204
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,820
Senior Brother,

205
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,480
I've already decided to stay here.

206
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,920
I don't want to have anything to do with His Majesty or the Mountain and Sea Gang anymore.

207
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,960
Considering our feelings for each other as Wind Takers,

208
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,600
please don't judge me.

209
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,760
Boss.

210
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,960
Xifan.

211
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,220
The second imperial edict is for you.

212
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:30,040
Xifan!

213
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,919
Are we just going to leave like this?

214
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,520
How will you report back to His Majesty?

215
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,300
Xifan.

216
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:43,080
Lu Ping escaped from death, I can't let him take any more risks.

217
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,820
I must think of a win-win approach.

218
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,640
But you must obey His Majesty.

219
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,600
It won't be easy to find a win-win solution.

220
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,220
I have such an approach.

221
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,240
Do you want to hear it?

222
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:01,160
You and Lu Ping always love to do everything by yourselves.

223
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,939
But if you have one more person, that's another brain to help think of a solution.

224
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:06,998
Such a simple concept, yet you still don't get it. Why must you get all the credit?

225
00:17:06,998 --> 00:17:10,799
Don't you remember when we cooperated to win at the Pneuma Combat Convention?

226
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,560
Catch!

227
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,340
You can get through the Mist Forest with my token.

228
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:19,178
Follow me! I have an idea.

229
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:26,159
What?

230
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:31,599
The Agile Dragon Army wants to take Lu Ping?

231
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,200
Yes.

232
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,600
They've already left but I don't think

233
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,360
they will give up this easily.

234
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,940
I had thought to keep him safe and at peace in Carefree Valley,

235
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:56,480
then I could fulfill my promise to his parents.

236
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,520
I never thought there would still be outsiders coming after him.

237
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,400
Looks like Carefree Valley

238
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,480
won't be peaceful for long.

239
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,740
Mo Chuangu,

240
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,819
I'm going to the back of the mountain to go for a retreat.

241
00:18:17,819 --> 00:18:21,680
It is still my rule that no one can come near me.

242
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,400
Yes, Sir.

243
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,100
Master.

244
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,039
These past few years, you always go to the back of the mountain every month to retreat.

245
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,500
What medicine are you making exactly?

246
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,439
Young Master's Pneuma of Pivot is fully developed now.

247
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,920
Why don't you ask him to help?

248
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:42,040
That boy! He doesn't want to inherit the valley.

249
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,639
What help can he give?

250
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,000
Don't say anything more.

251
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,360
Take care of Little Mo.

252
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:10,179
Does your father really know a way to break the lock?

253
00:19:10,179 --> 00:19:13,020
The most basic ability of an assassin is his intuition.

254
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:16,399
I can guarantee with my life that he knows.

255
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,580
He just doesn't want to say in case it causes more trouble.

256
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,320
See? Look how sneaky and mysterious he's acting.

257
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:24,720
He's definitely hiding some sort of secret from us.

258
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,380
Why do I think this isn't as simple as you think?

259
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:31,500
No matter if it is simple or complicated, if Lu Ping can safely break the Pneuma Confinement,

260
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,619
use all six Pneumas, then no one can defeat him.

261
00:19:34,619 --> 00:19:38,080
Then you can report back to Kaifeng with him,

262
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,920
protect your family, too.

263
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:43,460
Then later, we can come up with a crafty escape plan.

264
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,199
Two dilemmas become the best of both worlds.

265
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,060
It's good for everyone.

266
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:50,400
Thank you, still helping me even now.

267
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,540
It's no big deal.

268
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:58,280
I think the four of us have gone through so much since Wind Takers.

269
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,800
We shouldn't be separated.

270
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,700
Let's go.

271
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,559
Looks like we were right to come

272
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,759
He must have found the key to the lock,

273
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,760
he just can't bear to use it.

274
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,520
Father!

275
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,700
Father.

276
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,520
Father, are you all right?

277
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,280
- Poisoned.
- Medicine...

278
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,959
The medicine is in the room.

279
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,119
Senior, help me with my father.

280
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,200
Hurry, give this to him.

281
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,520
Lu Ping, why are you here?

282
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,679
You really are stubborn.

283
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,360
Even after I scolded you so thoroughly, you still won't give up.

284
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,919
Do you think only Mo Lin remembered the things from the convention?

285
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:28,860
I've been watching you ever since Mo Lin started to secretly follow you.

286
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:35,580
After you followed Elder Mo here,

287
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:38,960
the parrot seemed to sense something wasn't right.

288
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,520
It led me to Master Mo's room and helped me find this medicine.

289
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,320
Only then was I able to get here in time.

290
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:51,320
Boss, I just wanted to see if my father could help you break the lock.

291
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,920
You really are mischievous.

292
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,240
Master Mo,

293
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:04,800
your son is about to get married. I've also already decided to stay.

294
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,219
So you must take good care of your health.

295
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:10,300
Don't waste your power on me anymore.

296
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:15,359
You are getting married? Why didn't you tell me?

297
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:17,939
Father, I thought about telling you.

298
00:23:17,939 --> 00:23:20,279
But you're always disappearing every day and it's hard to find you.

299
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,660
What exactly are you doing?

300
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:24,460
Enough.

301
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,720
Hurry and help me back.

302
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,340
Gently!

303
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:55,120
Father, what is going on?

304
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,999
You've learned to secretly tail me.

305
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,839
- Getting rebellious?
- That flower is poisonous.

306
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:06,220
You go there once a month to poison yourself?

307
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:09,799
You're getting up there in age now, are you looking to die?

308
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:15,120
The Two Form Flower is poisonous.

309
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,160
But you're making a big deal out of nothing.

310
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,220
Two Form Flower?

311
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:23,200
The strange flowers that can rebuild the meridians?

312
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,839
Didn't it go extinct a long time ago?

313
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,120
You've managed to grow it again?

314
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:36,780
Did you raise the flower to break the lock for Lu Ping?

315
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,840
Why didn't you so earlier?

316
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,839
I haven't succeeded.

317
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,620
What's there to say then?

318
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:47,520
The Two Form Flower can rebuild meridians.

319
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,120
I thought of it at that time.

320
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,880
I've been cultivating the flower for years.

321
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:58,660
It can help Lu Ping protect his meridians and withstand the power of six pneumas.

322
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,160
That's great.

323
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:08,360
The flower is strange, but it's also poisonous.

324
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:15,499
We have to use human blood and Pneuma of Pivot to eliminate all the poison.

325
00:25:15,499 --> 00:25:19,820
Only this way, can it blossom and be made into a drug.

326
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:23,679
I've tried countless times for so many years.

327
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,920
Even with the superior blood of the Mo Family,

328
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:29,219
when I eliminate the poison about half way through,

329
00:25:29,219 --> 00:25:33,700
it starts to enter my lungs.

330
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:41,780
Fortunately, I have the herbs Little Mo gave me to ease the poison.

331
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:46,480
Otherwise, I would've died a long time ago.

332
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:53,240
That year, I promised Brother Leng

333
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:57,460
to find a way to save his son.

334
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:01,340
It's already been so many years, I am getting old.

335
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:03,099
I don't have enough power.

336
00:26:03,099 --> 00:26:06,320
Looks like I probably won't find a way to do it.

337
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:12,020
So, all these years your unwillingness to leave the valley,

338
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:16,840
wasn't because you were scared but because of this promise.

339
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,000
A promise of 19 years.

340
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,220
And you've hurt your health.

341
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:25,720
I've cursed you so many times before.

342
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,580
I was young before, too.

343
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:39,039
I know that you wanted to leave the valley to become someone.

344
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:42,240
I kept wanting you to stay

345
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,480
in case I wasn't able to hold on.

346
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:51,580
Then at least you'd be here to protect the Carefree Valley.

347
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,160
Father,

348
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:01,640
I was too selfish before.

349
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,680
Father, from now on,

350
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:10,280
I will protect Carefree Valley with you.

351
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:20,439
Enough. Enough. You… It is enough.

352
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,139
I am tired and I want to go to sleep.

353
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,920
Boss.

354
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,520
Senior Brother.

355
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:08,220
You heard what my father said, so now what should we do?

356
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:12,660
You need to cherish such a good father.

357
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,840
Don't mention the Two Form Flower again.

358
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,880
Lu Ping.

359
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,520
If it weren't for the flower, you'd have to stay here forever.

360
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,340
Somethings, after you've tried your best,

361
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:29,240
there's nothing more you can do.

362
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,160
Maybe it's just my fate.

363
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:39,200
You of all people should understand my respect for a father.

364
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:44,080
Otherwise, you wouldn't have blocked my three moves against your father.

365
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:49,760
I don't care about past grievances anymore.

366
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:54,600
Even if I can live a hundred years, it'd just be 36,500 days.

367
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:00,740
To take this in exchange to help my brother is worth it.

368
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,080
Boss.

369
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:11,900
You have to get ready for the wedding.

370
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,920
When you have time, spend more of it with your father.

371
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,999
Don't let the parrot show more filial piety than you.

372
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,580
You may not live up to my sister's expectations.

373
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,320
I'm off.

374
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,940
I haven't finished plowing the herb field as your father ordered.

375
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,060
Let's listen to Lu Ping.

376
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:37,940
When have we ever persuaded him to change his mind?

377
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:40,120
What about you then?

378
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:43,680
And the Force Eaters from the Mountain and Sea Gang.

379
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,899
We can't really let them go kill people, can we?

380
00:29:45,899 --> 00:29:48,380
You are both my juniors.

381
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:50,079
Your Senior Brother is still around.

382
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,000
When did it become your turn to worry?

383
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,200
Don't you believe in me?

384
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:25,159
Xifan, you haven't said a word after you got back from the valley.

385
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,199
Why did you ask me to meet out here?

386
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,900
Ziyan, I'm sorry.

387
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:33,680
I promised to take you to Kaifeng.

388
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,140
I'm afraid I won't be able to keep my promise again.

389
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:40,820
There's something that I have to ask for your help with.

390
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:50,080
The Two Form Flower can rebuild meridians.

391
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,660
I thought of it at that time.

392
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:55,559
I've cultivated the flower for years.

393
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:58,560
It can help Lu Ping protect his meridians and

394
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,600
withstand the power of six pneumas.

395
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:08,980
Can you break the lock while protecting my brother?

396
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:11,360
Impossible.

397
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,570
I promised Brother Leng

398
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:19,160
to find a way to save his son.

399
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:23,660
It's been so many years and I'm getting old.

400
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:25,620
I don't have enough power.

401
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:28,440
Looks like I probably won't find a way to do it.

402
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,400
Young Master!

403
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,940
What's wrong?

404
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,600
I am all right.

405
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,220
Before, I was poisoned a bit by the Mountain and Sea Gang.

406
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:42,440
It's not a big deal.

407
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,880
Shouldn't you tell Master?

408
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,599
It is my wedding today.

409
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:51,039
Moreover, Father hasn't fully recovered yet.

410
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,980
It'll worry him.

411
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:56,120
- But…
- Shut up.

412
00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:00,240
I still have to carry my bride tonight.

413
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,640
If you dare say anything...

414
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,980
don't make me throw you out of the valley.

415
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:10,739
Young Master, let's try on your wedding outfit.

416
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:17,379
- It looks good.
- Handsome.

417
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:21,399
By the way, didn't I tell you to go help for my master to get ready first?

418
00:32:21,399 --> 00:32:23,719
She is the one that should be the most beautiful. Is she ready?

419
00:32:23,719 --> 00:32:27,139
Young Master, if you're getting married, you should call her wife.

420
00:32:27,139 --> 00:32:30,720
Otherwise, you show little respect to your master and ancestors.

421
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,820
It's none of your business what I call her.

422
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,919
Have you prepared the things I've asked for?

423
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,919
Don't worry, Young Master! I prepared everything long ago.

424
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,560
Young Master!

425
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,999
Young Master, someone came with your token.

426
00:32:43,999 --> 00:32:45,840
She wanted to see you.

427
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,240
It's the token I gave Senior Brother.

428
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:10,100
Why is it you? Xifan asked you to come?

429
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:14,099
I came on my own will. Xifan doesn't know.

430
00:33:14,099 --> 00:33:18,440
To accommodate everyone, he decided to raise the flower with his own blood tonight.

431
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:22,980
I don't want him to take the risk, so I came to beg for your help.

432
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:25,380
Tell me everything.

433
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,100
What?

434
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:32,160
You are going to raise the Two Form Flower in place of Master Mo?

435
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:35,720
You can't! It's too dangerous.

436
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:39,340
If someone needs to take this risk, I'll go in your place.

437
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:43,320
The one who raises the flower needs to be able to use the Pneuma of Pivot.

438
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:46,239
I am the best candidate.

439
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,980
Yes. Win-win result.

440
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:51,459
It benefits Wuji Manor, it benefits Lu Ping, but what about you?!

441
00:33:51,459 --> 00:33:55,779
One has to sacrifice something to get something, I'm willing to take the risk.

442
00:33:55,779 --> 00:33:57,599
Enter the valley with me tomorrow.

443
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:02,420
If I make the flower blossom, remember to give it to Mo Lin.

444
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:04,020
Let's go.

445
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:11,059
Xifan, you're not willing to let Lu Ping get hurt.

446
00:34:11,059 --> 00:34:13,260
I'm not willing for you to get hurt.

447
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,540
It wasn't easy for me to be with you.

448
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,780
I only want you to be safe.

449
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:21,980
Don't worry! We have gotten through so many difficulties.

450
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:24,280
I believe it'll be the same this time.

451
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,120
It's getting late.

452
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,699
Let's go.

453
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:43,080
It does sound like Senior Brother.

454
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,220
So you came to find me

455
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:48,400
because you don't want him to take the risk.

456
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,999
If I had the Pneuma of Pivot, I'd go myself.

457
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,840
But...

458
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:01,740
now you're the only one that can save Lu Ping and Xifan.

459
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:04,440
You're not one to watch your friends die,

460
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,880
without doing anything.

461
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:12,920
Miss Ling, anyone who wants to make the flower blossom,

462
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,940
has to risk their life.

463
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:19,520
My father also got hurt because of it.

464
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:23,039
Also, you can already see, today is my wedding day.

465
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:26,860
Even if I was stupid, I wouldn't go die today.

466
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:30,699
But you are a descendent of Tiancan, so your Pneuma of Pivot is more powerful.

467
00:35:30,699 --> 00:35:33,840
You are more likely to succeed than Xifan.

468
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:38,800
Xifan entrusted this task to me, so that in case he dies,

469
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,460
there's still someone who can give the flower to Lu Ping.

470
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:44,480
He's already thinking he's already going to die.

471
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:49,399
But you are different, you even said it before, you're lucky.

472
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,980
If you are willing, I can sacrifice my own life

473
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:02,360
without a complaint.

474
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:12,620
Miss Ling, there's no need for that.

475
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:16,280
Regarding this matter, you really don't have to say anything.

476
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:19,460
Xifan and Lu Ping are my brothers.

477
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:21,920
I will definitely make sure nothing happens to them.

478
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:26,260
Mo Lin? Mo Lin!

479
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:28,760
Su Tang is coming, I have to go.

480
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:32,200
At least, I have to finish the wedding.

481
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:35,560
I have my own plans regarding the Two Form Flower.

482
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:40,600
But we are running out of time! Xifan, he…

483
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:44,460
There is a bamboo cabin in the southwest of the valley.

484
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,320
Wait for me there!

485
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,240
If I finish before nine, I will rush over there.

486
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,080
Young Lord Mo Lin!

487
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:01,259
Young Madam, different hair clasps have different meanings.

488
00:37:01,259 --> 00:37:03,840
Which one do you like?

489
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:11,080
Now you're the only one that can save Lu Ping and Xifan.

490
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,720
You're not one to watch you friends die

491
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:16,320
without doing anything.

492
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Mo Lin, does getting married really mean we need to do all these things?

493
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,439
What's wrong? Are they all pretty?

494
00:37:27,439 --> 00:37:29,660
You can't decide?

495
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:34,000
You deserve the best ones.

496
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,880
What about this one?

497
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,359
Young Master, good choice.

498
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,479
This is a Wishing hairpin.

499
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:47,400
You'll get everything you wish for and a smooth life.

500
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,899
Master, do you have a wish?

501
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:59,320
I wish for Brother and Miss Qin to meet again.

502
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:06,820
Boss is still missing her.

503
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:09,620
He's never mentioned her to me at all.

504
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:13,919
He feels guilty. He says he's given up,

505
00:38:13,919 --> 00:38:19,480
but I can tell that he still loves her.

506
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:23,360
I had thought that living here with my brother forever would be good.

507
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:27,920
But now I feel that I'm being too selfish.

508
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,800
It wasn't easy for me to find my beloved.

509
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:36,100
I just wish that my brother and Miss Qin can also find happiness.

510
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:42,019
That's right. Two Form Flower can protect human meridians.

511
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:47,659
It can break the lock and conquer the cold toxin in the Qin Sang's body.

512
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:51,040
This flower is important to us all.

513
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,620
Mo Lin. Mo Lin!

514
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:59,560
Did I say something wrong?

515
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:03,679
No. My master is truly my master, you've thought through things better than I have.

516
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:06,919
Come! Let me see you in your wedding dress.

517
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,760
Let's see how beautiful you are!

518
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:11,539
Young Master, it's bad luck to see it now.

519
00:39:11,539 --> 00:39:13,680
Hurry, go on now. Go on.

520
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,119
Hurry up and get out!

521
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,040
Get out, get out!

522
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:27,380
Su Tang, this is the osmanthus candy I had to beg from Mo Chuangu.

523
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:31,640
I can't give you much but at least I can do this much.

524
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:44,640
Boss, let me borrow my master for a bit.

525
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,100
I forgot.

526
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:53,680
He's the one who has to give Su Tang her sweets now.

527
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,519
Where exactly are you taking me?

528
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,510
Aren't you afraid of missing the time? Your father and my brother are both waiting.

529
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:06,119
Then let them wait.

530
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:09,899
I am the young master, I can be willful at least once.

531
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:14,480
Master, do you smell that?

532
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,040
So fragrant!

533
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:23,280
Osmanthus forest! It has more trees than the last time I saw it!

534
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,620
And the osmanthus candy?

535
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:30,059
Not only osmanthus candy, but also osmanthus cakes, osmanthus dim-sum, and osmanthus wine.

536
00:40:30,059 --> 00:40:32,440
Look at how much I respect my master.

537
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,040
Look over there!

538
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:45,480
Didn't we say we'd get married before nine? Why bring me here?

539
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:50,339
The world's best assassin is getting married, it should be special.

540
00:40:50,339 --> 00:40:53,460
Master, do you know?

541
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:56,100
Assassins have a rule when working.

542
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:59,540
As long as there's something in our hearts that we worry about, then death won't take us.

543
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:03,039
Work? What work are you doing?

544
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,720
Mo Lin.

545
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:16,360
I am a little sleepy.

546
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:26,700
I just knew that if I put the medicine in the candy you'd definitely take it.

547
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,760
Master,

548
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,740
I will make the Two Form Flower blossom for Boss.

549
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:37,720
And I will make a second one

550
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:40,600
for Qin Sang.

551
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:45,080
Then it won't be hard on Senior Brother,

552
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,440
and he won't have to take the risk either.

553
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,640
I can help three people all at once.

554
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:54,960
With this job, I'll earn a lot.

555
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:01,880
I brought you here,

556
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:06,180
because I wanted to see you in your wedding outfit.

557
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:11,260
As long as I know in my heart that you're here waiting for me,

558
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:14,000
I will definitely come back.

559
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,460
Sleep well.

560
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:19,920
When you wake up,

561
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,160
you'll not only be my master,

562
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,080
but also my wife.

563
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:28,640
When you wake, please don't beat me up.
