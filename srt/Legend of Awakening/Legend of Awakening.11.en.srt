♫ The dark green sea is hazy ♫

3
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:32,750
♫ dissipating in a flash. ♫

4
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:36,570
♫ Rivers and lakes divide the world. ♫

5
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,030
♫ Ten thousands arrows are firing at once. ♫

6
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:43,980
♫ Who has time to worry? Who loves the color of blood? ♫

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,810
♫ At that time, spirits are high. ♫

8
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:51,640
♫ Who calls the world his home? Who dares let his horse freely run? ♫

9
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,380
♫ Silently, tears form in the death of night. ♫

10
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:58,180
♫ Heroes are cutting all ties, ♫

11
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:02,060
♫ giving up whether it's life or death, ♫

12
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,180
♫ never asking what the cost is. ♫

13
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:09,790
♫ Good and evil must be distinguished. ♫

14
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:13,750
♫ The wind blows off the snow. ♫

15
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:17,660
♫ On the body, etch multiple scars, ♫

16
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,760
♫ wandering all over the world, ♫

17
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:25,280
♫ only wish to ask for answers from this world. ♫

18

♫ There is no need for flowers in the dream. ♫

[Episode 11]

29
00:02:23,299 --> 00:02:27,679
These past three years, Su Tang and I have been staying at the Wind Taker Institute.

30
00:02:27,679 --> 00:02:30,260
Our master might be reckless,

31
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,660
lazy, greedy, and a drunk,

32
00:02:33,359 --> 00:02:35,500
but he is very kind to us.

33
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,299
I'll take you to meet him if possible.

34
00:02:38,299 --> 00:02:39,690
All right!

35
00:02:46,539 --> 00:02:48,019
Ping'er.

36
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:53,479
Ping'er?

37
00:02:55,979 --> 00:02:57,380
Ping'er.

38
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,039
Ping'er!

39
00:03:07,679 --> 00:03:09,180
Ping'er!

40
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,859
- Ping'er.
- Uncle Wen...

41
00:03:16,859 --> 00:03:21,360
The Pneuma Confinement... is getting more powerful.

42
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,599
It's strangling me even more tightly.

43
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,779
Have you undergone Soul Splitting? Who helped you with it?

44
00:03:26,779 --> 00:03:29,080
I begged my master for it.

45
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:34,239
- I did it to attend the convention in order to see you.
- This is foolish!

46
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,958
The Pneuma Confinement is used by the Mountain and Sea Gang as a barrier to control your pneumatic power.

47
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:40,939
You've suppressed it all these years, so it had been gradually calmed down.

48
00:03:40,939 --> 00:03:42,260
But now that you've taken the liberty to apply the Soul Splitting,

49
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,780
the pneumatic power within you has turned into provoking the Pneuma Confinement.

50
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:47,559
If we don't break it soon, it will only get worse.

51
00:03:47,559 --> 00:03:49,300
Uncle Wen,

52
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,399
can you break it?

53
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,879
I can't.

54
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:58,440
I've been stripped of my martial arts skills.

55
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,039
If we are to break the confinement,

56
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:03,359
I have to seek help from my academy.

57
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:05,500
But tomorrow...

58
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,020
is the second round of the convention.

59
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:11,120
Eldest Senior will need me to get through the second round with him.

60
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:15,380
Ping'er.

61
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,870
Ping'er.

62
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,139
I know of your camaraderie.

63
00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:24,220
But the longer you stall, the worse you will get.

64
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,820
I'll be sure to send my master a letter tonight.

65
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,150
I'll also handover the military affairs.

66
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,460
Tomorrow, I'll go with you.

67
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:34,199
This is the final timeline.

68
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,090
If we don't break the confinement,

69
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:39,710
there's no chance in doing so again.

70
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:42,410
- But...
- No buts, Ping'er.

71
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:44,380
All these years,

72
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:49,160
haven't you fought hard to survive and to live like a human?

73
00:04:50,299 --> 00:04:54,459
If they truly regard you as a friend, they will understand.

74
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,300
Tomorrow, at noon, I'll be waiting for you at Xinghua House.

75

Tomorrow, at noon, I'll be waiting for you at Xinghua House.

76

Do you know how long I've been waiting for you?

79
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,599
You only got to meet Uncle Wen because of me.

80
00:05:50,599 --> 00:05:52,659
Shouldn't you thank me?

81
00:05:53,599 --> 00:05:54,979
Sure!

This is the best eating house in Kaifeng?

00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,260
Not really!

86
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:12,239
But it has the best wine in Kaifeng.

87
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:15,119
But I only have... Let's see!

88
00:06:17,159 --> 00:06:18,700
Ten taels.

89
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,820
We'll buy as much as we can with this.

90
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:24,419
Shop keeper! I want ten taels worth of wine.

This ten taels worth of wine wasn't bought by putting on the Qin family's tab through the golden badge.

Look! There's a shooting star.

00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,719
When I was with the Mountain and Sea Gang,

95
00:07:02,719 --> 00:07:05,739
all I ever had was endless torture and pain.

96
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,280
Only when I saw the stars at night from my cell,

97
00:07:12,159 --> 00:07:14,480
could I feel a moment of peace.

98
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:17,859
Even when I fled,

Su Tang once told me,

101
00:07:31,619 --> 00:07:35,080
if you want to give someone a gift, you have to be sincere.

102

So I am sharing my most precious starry sky with you.

103

Aren't we supposed to be looking at stars?

Why are you looking at me?

105

I...

106
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:02,099
Thank you.

107

Don't mention it!

108
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:14,460
It's not just because of Wen Gecheng.

109
00:08:15,299 --> 00:08:18,319
It's also for everything that has happened

I witnessed all sorts of wickedness in the Mountain and Sea Tower.

113
00:08:30,059 --> 00:08:32,099
You are the one who showed me

114
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,959
that in this world,

115
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:37,860
there are still wonderful things, just like the starry sky.

116
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,920
Sometimes, I think to myself,

117
00:08:50,379 --> 00:08:53,199
why did I escape from the Mountain and Sea Gang?

118

Perhaps,

119
00:08:59,359 --> 00:09:02,039
it's so that I can be with you,

120

to gaze upon a sky at night like this.

121

Lu Ping, you're really crafty.

122

I want to live like an ordinary man.

129
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:39,010
This is a wish that I've had for ten years.

130
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:42,259
Is that too much to ask for?

131
00:10:58,119 --> 00:11:00,279
Let's treat this as a farewell.

132
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:55,958
Young Lords, these are the four training outfits that you told us to make.

133

They are made in the latest style with the newest fabric.

134
00:11:58,499 --> 00:12:02,478
Once you put them on, you'll surely look gorgeous at the Pneuma Combat Convention.

135
00:12:02,478 --> 00:12:04,958
Take a look! How is it?

136

Eldest Senior, are you in your right mind?

137
00:12:08,098 --> 00:12:12,978
You, usually, can't even bear to have a good meal, where did you get enough money to buy such nice clothes?

138
00:12:18,699 --> 00:12:23,400
Store keeper, I'll pay the remaining of the cost with this jade pendant.

- Do you think it's all right?
- Let me take a look!

Normally, we only accept taels, not pawns.

141

However, since you both are so sincere,

142
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:49,039
I'll reluctantly accept it.

143
00:12:49,619 --> 00:12:51,219
Give it back!

144
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,979
Eldest Senior, I think this jade pendant is quite old.

145
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:04,158
You've always carried it on you, can this be your heirloom?

146
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:11,779
I really don't know what you're thinking, but it's not worth pawning your heirloom for a few training outfits.

147
00:13:11,779 --> 00:13:14,958
They are not some dragon armor; moreover, it will be a tough fight tomorrow.

148
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:18,460
Who knows? The outfits might get torn quickly. Let's go!

149
00:13:19,619 --> 00:13:22,060
I have yet fully recovered.

150
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:26,579
I've only managed to come this far because of the help from you guys.

151
00:13:26,579 --> 00:13:30,840
Tomorrow, we're going against Luo Ting, it will be a tough fight.

152
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:35,119
I just want to do something within my power to boost everyone's morale.

153
00:13:35,119 --> 00:13:36,719
Don't hold me back!

If the Pneuma Combat Convention awards the most obstinate person, you would win with your eyes closed.

But don't you worry! We might not be as skilled as Miss Qin.

00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,900
All right! I'll let you be the unsung hero.

161
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,710
Let's hurry back to show them.

162
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:15,838
Let's see if these training outfits can bring out the valiance in me.

163
00:14:15,838 --> 00:14:18,158
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

164
00:14:18,158 --> 00:14:22,160
Brother, are you really leaving? What can we do in the second round tomorrow?

165
00:14:22,798 --> 00:14:26,180
The reason we came to the convention, in the first place, was to look for Wen Gecheng.

166
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:29,060
Now that the purpose has been served, we don't have to go through with it.

167
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:34,460
Brother, Eldest Senior hasn't fully recovered yet and Luo Ting hates the Wind Taker Institute to the core.

168
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,640
He won't go easy on us in this combat.

169
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:40,278
If we both leave, Mo Lin is all that Eldest Senior has.

170
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,600
They will definitely lose to Luo Ting.

171
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,340
They can surrender if they can't defeat him.

172
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:47,158
Brother, you know what Eldest Senior is like.

173
00:14:47,158 --> 00:14:49,978
This concerns the honor of the Wind Take institute, I'm afraid that by that time,

174
00:14:49,978 --> 00:14:53,018
he won't surrender and he might even get himself killed.

175
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:55,010
If it ends up like that,

176
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:59,430
we'll get Assassin Boy to poison him senseless and drag him off-stage.

177
00:15:00,119 --> 00:15:01,840
Brother!

178
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,978
Lu Ping, are you in your right mind?

179
00:15:10,978 --> 00:15:12,919
We've come this far but you're going to abandon us?

180
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:14,699
So what if I abandon you?

181
00:15:14,699 --> 00:15:18,679
You're a useless bum without any strength, I found you a nuisance ages ago.

182
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:20,120
Lu Ping!

183
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:28,000
Lu Ping! Lu Ping.

184
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:33,450
After all that we've been through, I thought you've regarded yourself as a disciple of Wind Taker Institute.

185
00:15:34,119 --> 00:15:35,620
I don't!

186
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:39,979
Wind Taker Institute has always been just camouflage for me.

187
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,900
What if I ask you to stay?

188
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,640
These are the training outfits that were custom made.

189
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,800
Haven't you been complaining that we didn't have a decent uniform?

190
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,878
I've told you! We can't lose anyone in the Wind Taker Institute.

191
00:15:55,878 --> 00:16:00,399
As long as we fight alongside each other, we can surely win the convention and make our institute proud.

192
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:08,099
Zhao Xifan, why should I care if you can make the institute proud?

193
00:16:08,099 --> 00:16:12,840
I finally figured it out! You're just a hypocrite through and through.

194
00:16:14,359 --> 00:16:17,460
Lu Ping, what do you mean by that?

195
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:22,560
You want me to stay because you are no match for them.

196
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,158
You needed me as God of Bandits to help with your tasks.

197
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:28,319
Now, you need me on the team in order to win the convention.

198
00:16:28,319 --> 00:16:31,259
Don't keep up false appearances if you're incompetent.

199
00:16:31,259 --> 00:16:33,699
Didn't you always want to give up the badge of eldest disciple?

200
00:16:33,699 --> 00:16:36,219
Sure! Give it to me now!

201
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,459
I'm going to tell the judges now, that the Wind Taker Institute is disbanded.

202
00:16:43,459 --> 00:16:45,639
We're quitting the contest.

203
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:59,319
Fine! Lu Ping, you may leave.

204
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:01,478
Leave now!

205
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:04,200
Wind Taker Institute is no longer your concern.

206
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:08,499
Even if I'm the last one standing, I'll keep fighting until the end.

207
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:14,580
Sure! Then you better pray a few more times tonight.

208
00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:17,419
You're on your own now.

209
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:02,479
Brother, you truly broke Eldest Senior's heart this time.

210
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:10,620
Just as well! He'll stop pestering me.

211
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:15,319
Brother, I know what you have in mind.

212
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:20,510
You deliberately spoke harshly, so that Eldest Senior would make you leave.

213
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:24,079
Then you won't feel so bad, am I right?

214
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:31,279
Brother, you actually care about the Wind Taker Institute, right?

215
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:37,680
Not at all! I'm not like him.

216
00:18:38,999 --> 00:18:40,919
He wants to be a hero.

217
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:44,350
He wants to carry the Wind Taker Institute forward.

218
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:49,339
But all I've ever wanted is to be an ordinary person.

219
00:18:50,219 --> 00:18:55,119
If I keep competing, my identity might be revealed.

220
00:18:56,059 --> 00:18:58,639
By then, the Mountain and Sea Gang will come after me again.

221
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:02,319
Who will be able to protect me then?

222
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:06,150
Su Tang,

223
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:09,210
can you let me act selfishly for once?

224
00:19:16,999 --> 00:19:21,170
I've thought of a way! You can leave, I'll stay.

225
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:24,059
- Su Tang.
- As a child, I lost my family.

226
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:28,039
All this while, I knew you had been protecting me from the Mountain and Sea Gang.

227
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:29,939
You are my brother.

228
00:19:29,939 --> 00:19:32,550
Whatever decision you make,

229
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:35,990
as your sister, I'll always support you.

230
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:40,998
You'll go with Mr. Wen to break your confinement, I'll watch over Eldest Senior for you, isn't that a good idea?

231
00:19:40,998 --> 00:19:42,500
- But...
- Don't worry!

232
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:45,380
I won't let Eldest Senior take any risk.

233
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:05,619
Just as well! My future is uncertain.

234
00:20:05,619 --> 00:20:09,440
If you stay with him, at least you'll have someone to depend on.

235
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:34,318
Eldest Senior, don't be so harsh on yourself.

236
00:20:34,318 --> 00:20:37,579
If you're angry, I'll go drug Lu Ping.

237
00:20:37,579 --> 00:20:40,779
It will definitely keep him from leaving, what do you think?

238
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,590
Eldest Senior?

239
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,100
Is he meditating?

240
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:05,870
He just had a fight with Lu Ping for Lu Ping is leaving with Wen Gecheng.

241
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:10,240
He'll not compete in the convention tomorrow; Eldest Senior has been meditating since.

242
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,480
He said he is going to recover quickly and he won't talk to anyone.

243
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:19,590
Eldest Senior!

244
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:22,079
You rascal, you are making me worried.

245
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:24,019
Master, I have some medicine to dispel blood stasis.

246
00:21:24,019 --> 00:21:26,519
Good! Give it to him quickly.

247
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:35,599
How are you feeling?

248
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:37,820
He is feeling better.

249
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:45,459
Xifan, the process comes first, the results come second.

250
00:21:45,459 --> 00:21:49,420
It's the participation that matters and your health is the most important.

251
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:56,059
Master, I know you're just saying that to make me feel better.

252
00:21:56,059 --> 00:21:58,420
But I failed to keep Lu Ping with us.

253
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:02,399
As the eldest disciple, that was a dereliction of my duty.

254
00:22:02,399 --> 00:22:04,939
I can't embarrass Wind Taker Institute again.

255
00:22:04,939 --> 00:22:08,759
Mo Lin, you need to leave us.

256
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,820
I have to speak with my disciple in private.

257
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:16,019
You're new here so you have no right to listen in. Step outside!

258
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,799
As your Master, I'll be honest with you.

259
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:36,779
I've sent you here to protect Lu Ping.

260
00:22:36,779 --> 00:22:40,600
I don't care if you win or not.

261
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,359
- Master, what did you say?
- Protect Lu Ping!

262
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:45,380
Didn't he tell you?

263
00:22:46,019 --> 00:22:48,559
He is not here to take part in the convention, either.

264
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:51,940
Then... What about surpassing Big Dipper?

265
00:22:53,859 --> 00:22:57,340
The crazier we seem, the safer we are.

266
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,559
This is a strategy! Do you get it?

267
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:01,740
Lu Ping, Lu Ping, it's always about Lu Ping!

268
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:05,659
You taught us to punish evil, promote the good, get rid of bullies, and help the weak. Is all that a lie?

269
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:08,110
You have nothing to do anyway.

270
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:10,250
You might as well make some money.

271
00:23:16,219 --> 00:23:18,319
Xifan.

272
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:24,200
I know that I'm also not a competent Master.

273
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,598
So you don't have to go all out for Wind Taker Institute, either.

274
00:23:27,598 --> 00:23:31,019
- It's not worth it!
- Worth it!

275
00:23:31,019 --> 00:23:32,820
Xifan!

276
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,340
I don't mean to disobey you.

277
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:40,600
Ever since I joined the Wind Taker Institute and was mentored by you,

278
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,839
it has been my ambition to protect the Wind Taker Institute.

279
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:47,850
Even if no one is truly devoted to the Wind Taker Institute now,

280
00:23:48,439 --> 00:23:51,740
I will still choose to protect it.

281
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:54,940
- Master, please agree to it.
- As if I would!

282
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:58,300
I am your Master, you have to obey my decision.

283
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,720
I won't.

284
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:03,599
You're such a stubborn mule. This is so annoying!

285
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,820
Must you compete?

286
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:12,520
- I definitely must.
- Fine! I'll make you a wager.

287
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,380
If you win, I'll let you compete.

288
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:17,519
If you lose, you must return to Chenqiao immediately.

289
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:21,599
Why are you sneaking around?

290
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,340
Mo Lin! What is going on?

291
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:30,179
It's complicated.

292
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:34,479
They seemed to have had an argument; moreover, they seem to be parting ways.

293
00:24:34,479 --> 00:24:36,359
Say something nice!

294
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:42,280
Xifan, tomorrow, you'll be in grave danger.

295
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,839
Just like this hand, you'll be alone without any help.

296
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:49,119
If you can lift this table up with the strength of your palm, I will let you compete.

297
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:50,720
Go ahead!

298
00:24:51,739 --> 00:24:56,059
Master, this table is made of stone.

299
00:24:56,059 --> 00:25:00,099
Not to mention that Eldest Senior doesn't have any pneumatic power now, but even if he did, he might not be able to lift it.

300
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:16,160
I have an idea.

301
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,400
But if I succeed,

302
00:25:19,139 --> 00:25:22,559
Su Tang and Mo Lin, will you be willing to compete with me tomorrow?

303
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,599
My coming back here, exactly is to help you.

304
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:31,960
Since my disciple is staying, as the greatest assassin in the world, how can I get cold feet?

305
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,820
Later, the two of you...

306
00:25:39,999 --> 00:25:43,099
Great idea! Eldest Senior, you're really something.

307
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,020
You're too crafty.

308
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:10,639
Master, you said we can't replace him but you didn't say we can't work together.

309
00:26:10,639 --> 00:26:14,520
You said one palm but you didn't say we can't use five fingers.

310
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:18,840
Eldest Senior used two fingers, I used two, and Mo Lin used one.

311
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,280
That makes five fingers.

312
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:24,160
We've helped Eldest Senior form one hand today.

313
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:27,599
We'll also fight alongside him tomorrow.

314
00:26:28,419 --> 00:26:30,419
All right, whatever!

315
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:32,420
You've all grown up.

316
00:26:33,819 --> 00:26:39,119
- Bear this in mind! Make sure to return alive tomorrow.
- Yes.

317
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:41,680
Master, you still haven't seen the new outfit we made.

318
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,790
- I'll show them to you.
- Sure!

319
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:46,939
Su Tang, thank you for staying.

320
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:50,640
My staying behind, firstly, is to help you;

321
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,939
secondly, is to give my brother a sense of longing.

322
00:26:53,939 --> 00:26:57,839
I hope he can return to the Wind Taker Institute for my sake.

323
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,359
Let's hope so!

324
00:27:03,379 --> 00:27:07,140
The second round is tomorrow, can you help me enhance my pneumatic power a bit more?

325
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:10,040
Young Master, Master gave orders that you can't use the Marrow Washing skill in public.

326
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,759
I really can't help you again.

327
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:15,499
I don't care! Anyway, for tomorrow's second round, I must not be defeated.

328
00:27:15,499 --> 00:27:17,999
Otherwise, how am I to propose to Sangsang?

329
00:27:17,999 --> 00:27:19,900
Young Lord Wei.

330
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,780
Luo Ting? Why did you ask to see me?

331
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:26,580
I'm here to congratulate you for making it past the first round.

332
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:29,838
But I heard that you lost to Lu Ping and his gang in Chan State.

333
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:31,999
Yet now, your pneumatic power suddenly improved.

334
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,340
You made it past the first round with ease.

335
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:38,600
I would really like to ask you for some tips, what's your secret?

336
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,920
Why should I tell you?

337
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:45,900
This is what you don't understand: The aristocrats in the capital have their own social circles;

338
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,919
it's also the same for Qin Sang.

339
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:52,179
Although you're young and talented,

340
00:27:52,179 --> 00:27:57,399
without a few local friends, I'm afraid you'll still be shunned.

341
00:27:58,279 --> 00:28:03,360
If you're willing to share your tips with me, I'll be your sworn brother.

342
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,039
By then, you'll have lots of chances to approach Qin Sang.

343
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:08,540
Really?

344
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:14,398
Is there such a skill? You can borrow power from others?

345
00:28:14,398 --> 00:28:19,240
Senior, I think the champion of this Pneuma Combat Convention is definitely ours.

346
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,759
- Qiao Ying.
- Yes.

347
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:25,038
Go to one of the examiners to rat out Wei Tianqi.

348
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:29,358
Just say that he has brought his personal guards with him to the exam

349
00:28:29,358 --> 00:28:33,210
and he even cheated, in order to get him to scram sooner.

350
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,980
No one else must know about the Marrow Washing technique.

351
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:40,420
This person mustn't remain in the convention.

352
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:42,319
I understand, Senior.

353
00:28:44,179 --> 00:28:48,260
A countryside parvenu dares to dream of being friends with us?

354
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,019
What a fool!

355
00:29:04,419 --> 00:29:07,080
Why are you short of one member?

356
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:12,080
One of us is injured and decided to quit, so the three of us can keep going.

357
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,078
Miss, Shining Sky Academy's male team is in the East Group.

358
00:29:36,078 --> 00:29:38,519
That saves us the trouble of going against our peers.

359
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:43,820
But this year, the West Group is also very competitive, we'll have to be more careful later.

360
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:47,100
That's odd! Why isn't Lu Ping here?

361
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,300
Today is the second round of Pneuma Combat Convention.

362
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:57,640
This round, it tests you on strategy and teamwork.

363
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,479
The venue is the woods below you.

364
00:30:00,479 --> 00:30:04,958
The woods are divided into half by a red rope for the East and the West groups.

365
00:30:04,958 --> 00:30:08,359
Not only are you up against complex terrains,

366
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:11,379
but also the attacks from other teams.

367
00:30:11,379 --> 00:30:15,440
The last team standing in each group is the winning team.

368
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,580
You'll go straight into the finals.

369
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:23,299
Although lives are taken on battlefields, His Majesty is too kind.

370
00:30:23,299 --> 00:30:27,299
Every team leader will receive an emergency smoke signal.

371
00:30:27,299 --> 00:30:30,259
When your lives are in danger, you can use it to seek aid.

372
00:30:30,259 --> 00:30:34,178
Once it is lit, it's deemed that the team has surrendered.

373
00:30:34,178 --> 00:30:36,178
There are four hours in this round.

374
00:30:36,178 --> 00:30:40,779
Now, every team will enter the venue according to the order of the lots were drawn.

375
00:30:40,779 --> 00:30:45,438
You have time until half a joss stick burns out to select a spot that is the best for you.

376
00:30:45,438 --> 00:30:49,659
The competition will commence at the sound of the drum.

377
00:31:18,939 --> 00:31:22,439
We're in the same group as that bum. How unlucky!

378
00:31:28,719 --> 00:31:30,999
You're still short one person right before the competition starts.

379
00:31:30,999 --> 00:31:34,059
After hearing that you guys are up against the Shining Sky Academy,

380
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:37,000
was he too scared to get up from his bed?

381
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,679
Tackling some weasels like you?

382
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:42,160
I, the greatest assassin in the world, alone is enough.

383
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,720
So, you are the Eldest Senior?

384
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,560
You might as well gloat now when you can.

385
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:52,960
I'm afraid you won't get another chance later.

386
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:06,480
Eldest Senior, they seem so arrogant, they must have some dirty tricks up their sleeves.

387
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,718
It will be a tough fight today.

388
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:12,199
I already guessed that Luo Ting will resort to some dirty tricks.

389
00:32:12,199 --> 00:32:15,680
Later, just follow me.

390
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:31,259
How about here?

391
00:32:31,259 --> 00:32:33,779
Mo Lin, before the drum is sounded,

392
00:32:33,779 --> 00:32:36,839
set a trap here as our defense.

393
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:40,479
Eldest Senior, instead of acting like cowards, why don't we just rush out and fight?

394
00:32:40,479 --> 00:32:42,579
This is unlike you.

395
00:32:42,579 --> 00:32:46,639
Little Disciple, you don't get it, do you? This is called a strategy!

396
00:32:46,639 --> 00:32:50,378
Su Tang, we're outnumbered and my Pneuma of Sound is damaged.

397
00:32:50,378 --> 00:32:53,079
It's hard to distinguish directions, that's why we can't have a face off.

398
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:56,579
But, it's very foggy in here today! This will play to our advantage.

399
00:32:56,579 --> 00:33:00,038
We just need to hold down our fort here and wait for them to fight each other first,

400
00:33:00,038 --> 00:33:02,140
then we'll find an opportunity.

401
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:04,639
- Very well, Eldest Senior.
- Sure, Eldest Senior!

402
00:33:04,639 --> 00:33:09,079
Who knew although you're injured, your brains are still sharp, appropriate for leading an army.

403
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:13,418
As long as Wind Taker Institute can win, I don't care if they call me a coward.

404
00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:17,038
Disciple, come and help me!

405
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:20,620
We'll show them what I can do. Come along!

406
00:33:21,138 --> 00:33:22,659
Hold on!

407
00:33:22,659 --> 00:33:25,658
Su Tang, you still have another task.

408
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,380
Time's up! Sound the drum!

409
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,499
Senior, it's foggy in the woods today.

410
00:33:46,499 --> 00:33:49,759
It's harder to search for opponents.

411
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:57,118
Don't worry! I've already talked to the other teams.

412
00:33:57,118 --> 00:34:00,299
No one will interfere with the fight between Shining Sky's team and Wind Taker's team.

413
00:34:00,299 --> 00:34:04,998
Therefore, if anyone is moving around, it has to be the Wind Taker team.

414
00:34:04,998 --> 00:34:09,579
Senior, you're so smart! Let's see where those weasels from the Wind Taker Institute can run off to.

415
00:34:16,529 --> 00:34:20,160
We just have to keep waiting in here.

416
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:27,359
Someone is coming!

417
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,840
Let's go!

418
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,199
Over here!

419
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,880
What is this?

420
00:35:43,009 --> 00:35:45,739
Gentlemen, how are you?

421
00:35:45,739 --> 00:35:48,898
Zhao Xifan, how dare you play such tricks?

422
00:35:48,898 --> 00:35:53,739
When we're up against villains, who cares about being just and righteous?

423
00:35:54,279 --> 00:35:56,758
Here is a word of advice! Don't waste your strength.

424
00:35:56,758 --> 00:36:00,278
Here in the worm grass, the more you struggle, the deeper you sink.

425
00:36:00,278 --> 00:36:02,979
Unless you've mastered two pneumatic powers, it'll be difficult to get out of it.

426
00:36:02,979 --> 00:36:05,839
Why don't you light up your smoke signal to surrender?

427
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:08,769
I'll let you out if you do, how about that?

428
00:36:08,769 --> 00:36:12,838
Surrender? The game has just started.

429
00:36:20,289 --> 00:36:23,679
Has he already mastered two pneumatic powers? How is that possible in such a short time?

430
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:29,518
I've concealed my pneumatic power just to see what you weasels have up your sleeves.

431
00:36:29,518 --> 00:36:33,179
Enough nonsense, let's fight! Stop whining like a sissy.

432
00:36:33,179 --> 00:36:36,958
Sure! Today, I'll show you countryside people

433
00:36:36,958 --> 00:36:41,138
that the foundation of a century-old prestigious family can't be shaken by a few minions.

434
00:36:41,138 --> 00:36:43,339
Beat them to death!

435
00:37:02,489 --> 00:37:04,388
You had better light your smoke signal.

436
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:07,388
If not, no one can survive under the Sun Streamer Swordplay.

437
00:37:07,388 --> 00:37:10,940
Since we're here in the convention, we have no fear of death.

438
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:15,438
Miss Qin, are you going to bully us with your standing?

439
00:37:15,438 --> 00:37:18,289
I'm overpowering you with my swordplay.

440
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,700
You...

441
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:33,660
Don't get me wrong! As for the competition, I have to win.

442
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:37,159
Martial arts practitioners should act more righteously

443
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:39,719
instead of pitting your lives against mine here.

444
00:37:39,719 --> 00:37:42,808
Don't worry! Even if you lose the competition,

445
00:37:42,808 --> 00:37:46,079
I'll still refer you to my brother.

446
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,199
Thank you, miss.

447
00:37:50,199 --> 00:37:53,298
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

448
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,058
Ziyan, we're almost done here.

449
00:37:58,058 --> 00:38:00,889
Let's check out the East Group.

450
00:38:00,889 --> 00:38:04,820
But according to the rules, we can't leave our own venue.

451
00:38:06,739 --> 00:38:08,940
Miss Qin has been fighting alongside us.

452
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:11,400
She has never left the West Group.

453
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:17,618
See? That's how you should abuse authority.

454
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:28,100
Miss, it's the Wind Taker Institute.

455
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:34,798
Look! How did Luo Ting improve so much overnight?

456
00:38:34,798 --> 00:38:37,178
He must have used some dirty tricks.

457
00:38:37,178 --> 00:38:39,329
What a bully!

458
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:48,619
That's odd! Why isn't Lu Ping here yet?

459
00:38:48,619 --> 00:38:51,639
Xifan and the others obviously aren't a match for Luo Ting.

460
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,400
Could Young Master Lu be injured elsewhere?

461
00:38:57,730 --> 00:39:01,819
Qin Sang, I still wish to break the confinement.

462
00:39:01,819 --> 00:39:05,009
I want to live like an ordinary man.

463
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:07,219
This is a wish that I've had for ten years.

464
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:09,119
Is it too much to ask for?

465
00:39:11,069 --> 00:39:15,078
This is bad! I'm afraid he is never coming back.

466
00:39:15,078 --> 00:39:17,888
That rascal! He has gone back on his word.

467
00:39:17,888 --> 00:39:20,519
He said he would compete against me.

468
00:39:22,069 --> 00:39:24,239
Ziyan, stay here!

469
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:26,099
I'll be away for a while.

470
00:39:26,099 --> 00:39:28,818
Miss, what about the competition?

471
00:39:28,818 --> 00:39:32,498
We have plenty of time and we don't have any more opponents anyway.

472
00:39:32,498 --> 00:39:35,439
I'll be right back! You keep an eye on the Wind Taker Institute's people.

473
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:37,579
Xifan might not last much longer.

474
00:39:37,579 --> 00:39:40,969
If anything goes wrong, light a cloud of smoke to alert me.

475
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:51,238
I wonder which rascal dared to rat me out?

476
00:39:51,239 --> 00:39:53,279
Doesn't he know who my father is?

477
00:39:53,279 --> 00:39:55,258
Pneuma Combat Convention?

478
00:39:55,258 --> 00:39:58,588
How dare they disqualify a talent like me? They are mere flies on the wall.

479
00:39:58,588 --> 00:40:01,178
Young Master, Master said that if you lose,

480
00:40:01,178 --> 00:40:03,859
you should return to Chan State as soon as possible.

481
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:08,268
Wei Ying, just because Wei Ming isn't here, it doesn't mean you get to play boss to preach me.

482
00:40:08,268 --> 00:40:10,639
How can there be so many accidents?

483
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:13,618
Listen! When the examiner get to see how gifted I am,

484
00:40:13,618 --> 00:40:16,119
I'll definitely rise from desperation.

485
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,059
Isn't Sangsang competing in the second round?

486
00:40:22,059 --> 00:40:24,289
What is she doing here?

487
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:45,540
Stop right there!

488
00:40:56,199 --> 00:41:00,739
Miss Qin, instead of competing in the venue this morning,

489
00:41:00,739 --> 00:41:03,240
why are you here to see me?

490
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:10,700
Lu Ping, do you know what happens to deserters in my brother's army?

491
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:14,329
[Xinghua House]

492
00:41:35,899 --> 00:41:39,580
According to the martial law of Shuo State, deserters will be executed.

493
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:44,159
It's because those who flee from danger,

494
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:47,240
are deemed unrighteous for deserting their comrades.

495
00:41:48,009 --> 00:41:51,218
But Lu Ping, I know you're not that kind of person.

496
00:41:51,218 --> 00:41:53,939
- But today, why did you—
- Qin San.

497
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,159
Have you forgotten?

498
00:41:57,219 --> 00:42:02,020
I only attended Pneuma Combat Convention in order to find Uncle Wen.

499
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:04,719
I don't care at all about winning or losing.

500
00:42:05,259 --> 00:42:07,799
He is now waiting for me at Xinghua House.

501
00:42:07,799 --> 00:42:10,019
He is going to get my confinement unleashed.

502
00:42:12,529 --> 00:42:15,000
I've been waiting for this day for ten years.

503
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:20,080
Others might not understand it, do you not understand it, either?

504
00:42:24,659 --> 00:42:26,639
Coward!

505
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,769
What did you say?

506
00:42:33,769 --> 00:42:35,898
I said you're a coward.

507
00:42:35,898 --> 00:42:38,779
We made a deal to compete fair and square for once.

508
00:42:38,779 --> 00:42:40,839
Yet now, you're running away at the last moment.

509
00:42:40,839 --> 00:42:43,078
You clearly are worried about the safety of Xifan and others

510
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:45,669
but you insist on saying you're not.

511
00:42:45,669 --> 00:42:47,609
I despise you.

512
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,200
I actually...

514
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:14,920
♫ Waiting to be buried by the lake in the town, ♫

515
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:21,020
♫ the White Paper Boat drifting with sorrow. ♫

516
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:26,870
♫ Lights on the other side of the sea ♫

517
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:35,620
♫ punched fingertips in the red water tower. ♫

518
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:45,030
♫ Watch the little boat churning, laughing at the ordinariness. ♫

519
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:49,280
♫ Like a kite being pulled into a low altitude, ♫

520
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:54,690
♫ I smiled to the leaving person. ♫

521
00:43:54,690 --> 00:43:59,020
♫ The more spotlight, the more vivid the story. ♫

522
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:04,010
♫ Laughing like the moon, ♫

523
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:08,410
♫ regretting the lighthouse broke in the waves, ♫

524
00:44:08,410 --> 00:44:15,960
♫ I call the Milky Way that isolates us all, blue. ♫

525
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:23,210
♫ Like a moat built under the sea, ♫

526
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:27,990
♫ waiting for the words on the paper boat to disappear, ♫

527
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:34,890
♫ there must always be someone who doesn’t remember listening to the other. ♫

528
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:42,620
♫ Anyone who is correctly guessed will end in disfavor. ♫

529
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:46,830
♫ You are particularly touched but others consider it ordinary. ♫

530
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:52,170
♫ Like the author, roughly put down with a weak stroke, ♫

531
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:56,540
♫ the writing boat on the lake was just like a paper crane in the air. ♫

00:44:56,540 --> 00:45:01,350
♫ Laughing like the moon, ♫

533

♫ regretting the lighthouse broke in the waves, ♫

♫ I call the Milky Way that isolates us all, blue. ♫

535
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:20,940
♫ Can a moat be built on the seabed? ♫

536
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:25,360
♫ Wipe all the words on the paper boat! ♫

537
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:32,820
♫ Please let someone not remember and don't tell another! ♫

538
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:39,820
♫ Hide the reluctance between words ♫

539
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:44,540
♫ Unfortunately, I (you) are an average author ♫

540
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:52,600
♫ No matter how you (I) describe the rest, it's unnecessary! ♫

541
00:45:54,120 --> 00:46:02,940
♫ Don't describe my unfulfilled promise! ♫

542
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:11,760
♫ Don't interpret my hidden fire-smoke! ♫

543
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:20,720
♫ Don't let the paper boat in the rough wave chasing me! ♫

♫ Don't wait until it's over to know there are you and me! ♫
