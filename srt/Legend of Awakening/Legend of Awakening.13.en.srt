00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:28,970
♫ The dark green sea is hazy ♫

3
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:32,770
♫ dissipating in a flash. ♫

4
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:36,630
♫ Rivers and lakes divide the world. ♫

5
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,980
♫ Ten thousands arrows are firing at once. ♫

6
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:43,980
♫ Who has time to worry? Who loves the color of blood? ♫

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,830
♫ At that time, spirits are high. ♫

8
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:51,670
♫ Who calls the world his home? Who dares let his horse freely run? ♫

9
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:54,280
♫ Silently, tears form in the death of night. ♫

10
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,250
♫ Heroes are cutting all ties, ♫

11
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:02,060
♫ giving up whether it's life or death, ♫

12
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,170
♫ never asking what the cost is. ♫

13
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:09,850
♫ Good and evil must be distinguished. ♫

14
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:13,780
♫ The wind blows off the snow. ♫

15
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:17,620
♫ On the body, etch multiple scars, ♫

16
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,710
♫ wandering all over the world, ♫

17
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:25,190
♫ only wish to ask for answers from this world. ♫

18
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:29,230
♫ A teenager doesn't have to be a hero. ♫

19
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:33,070
♫ There is no need for flowers in the dream. ♫

20
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,230
♫ Destiny need not be afraid. ♫

21
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:40,790
♫ Because you have him all the way, ♫

Tomorrow's final round will be held in the ring.

30
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,439
The Wind Takers' Xifan is still in bad health,

31
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,040
Su Tang and Mo Lin are no match for you.

32
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,800
The only remaining competitor you'll have is Lu Ping.

33
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,800
I've waited for tomorrow for so long.

34
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,439
Finally, I have the chance to teach this brat a lesson.

35
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,520
Miss, if the Wind Takers lose,

36
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:48,599
they probably will be assigned to a normal position and be stationed outside of Kaifeng, right?

37
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,051
Ling Ziyan, what are you trying to say?

38
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,440
Miss, you come from a wealthy family and you have the general's protection.

39
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,380
However, Young Master Lu comes from a poor background.

40
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:02,271
Without the award from His Majesty, I'm afraid bad things will happen to him.

41
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,199
So, areyou asking me to lose to Lu Ping on purpose?

42
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,359
Miss, people from the Mountain and Sea Gang do weird practices. You also know that!

43
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,400
Ling Ziyan, are you still a member of my Qin family?

44
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,959
I think it looks like you are helping others.

45
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,760
- Miss, I…
- Let me tell you!

46
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,439
This Pneuma Combat Convention relates to the bet between my brother and I.

47
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,251
If I fake my action in public,

48
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:32,631
my royal family will lose face.

49
00:03:32,631 --> 00:03:35,311
How do you want my brother to survive?

50
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,631
Beyond all that,

51
00:03:38,631 --> 00:03:42,820
he and I already made a public agreement about a fair competition.

52
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:46,951
If I fake my actions, it would belittle Lu Ping

53
00:03:46,951 --> 00:03:49,211
and the public will look down upon him.

54
00:03:49,211 --> 00:03:52,611
Miss, you've considered it thoroughly, I know my mistake now.

55
00:03:54,580 --> 00:04:01,711
Tomorrow, I'll try my best to compete with him fair and square.

[Pneuma Combat Convention Ranking]

57
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:40,971
Lu Ping, why are we always three people; always missing one?

58
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,399
Only me, the ever-victorious general, is always here.

59
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:46,580
It's either you or Zhao Xifan that's absent from time to time.

60
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,659
That' right! When you take someone as your disciple,

61
00:04:49,659 --> 00:04:53,171
you are defeated repeatedly and you still keep on trying.

62
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:58,260
My disciple, we are meant to fight side by side.

63
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:01,451
From now on, I'll give you my back.

64

Who cases about your back?

65
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,499
Brother, you can't lose to her.

66

Don't worry!

67

I'll try my best to show my utmost respect to her.

This is the Pneuma Combat Convention, can't you be more serious.

- She can escape that?
- Yes.

are you clear about what you just did?

111
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:05,231
You just escaped the secret skill of the Qin family.

112
00:10:05,231 --> 00:10:08,571
That was the Sun Streamer Swordplay which no one has broken.

113
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,240
It is the secret skill of the Qin family.

114
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,691
She actually can escape the Sun Streamer Swordplay.

115

This is incredible.

116
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,600
It is Terrific!

117
00:10:18,831 --> 00:10:21,251
When did you secretly learn it?

118
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:26,311
Miss, I didn't mean to learn it.

119
00:10:26,311 --> 00:10:28,631
I just often see your actions,

120
00:10:28,631 --> 00:10:32,020
so I just naturally got familiar with the Sun Streamer Swordplay.

121
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:36,379
But I didn't mean to break the Sun Streamer Swordplay. Really!

122
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:41,500
Not good! Miss Ling put herself in danger.

123

Yes.

125
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:59,731
Wen Rui, it's my family's affair, why are you putting your hands to it?

126
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,399
Miss, Ling Ziyan can't be left alive.

127
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,139
You are clear that the previous victories without battle

128
00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:09,739
are mostly because of General's sword techniques.

129
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,979
Now that there's someone who can break the Sun Streamer Swordplay,

130
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:14,540
do you think they will just let her go?

131
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:21,199
Miss, General Qin is the heart and soul of our battlefield.

132
00:11:21,199 --> 00:11:23,079
If Ling Ziyan is captured by our enemy someday,

133
00:11:23,079 --> 00:11:26,241
General will get into trouble, the consequence cannot be imagined.

134
00:11:26,241 --> 00:11:29,019
It is not only your family affair, but also a national affair related to General Qin

135
00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:31,011
and to the Agile Dragon Army's kingdom.

136
00:11:31,011 --> 00:11:34,611
So I plead with you to put the interest of the whole situation to the top priority.

137
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,871
Miss, I know my mistake.

138
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:48,240
Miss, if you can't bear it, I can do it for you.

139
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,279
Miss, I'll make it easy for you.

140
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,971
I'll take my own life.

141
00:12:21,971 --> 00:12:23,620
Stop!

142
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,471
Lu Ping, it's none of your business.

143
00:12:30,471 --> 00:12:32,200
Step back!

144
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:39,571
She escaped the Sun Streamer Swordplay to rescue me.

145
00:12:39,571 --> 00:12:42,291
I must be responsible for her.

146
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,111
I must protect Ling Ziyan.

147
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,200
Lu Ping, you don't understand.

148
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,351
No matter how much I long for the pugilist world,

149
00:12:58,351 --> 00:13:02,279
I have no other choice when I have my family's honor and disgrace on my shoulders.

150
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:04,471
The Qin family is a royal family, isn't it?

151
00:13:04,471 --> 00:13:08,420
Do royal families have the right to take the life of others casually?

152
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:11,839
Step back! It's none of your business.

153
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,611
What if I insist to be involved?

154
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,460
- That's…
- That's… That's…

155
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,819
That's the token of the Qin family.

156
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,539
How can Wind Taker Institute have the token of the Qin family?

157
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,619
Exactly!

158
00:13:26,619 --> 00:13:28,611
Do you remember this token?

159
00:13:28,611 --> 00:13:31,531
It's from the Emperor.

00:13:31,531 --> 00:13:33,671
Just now, I showed you all that I am its bearer.

161
00:13:33,671 --> 00:13:36,620
A token for a life.

162
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,650
It's not too much to ask for, isn't it?

163
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,511
Even with a gold token in hand, you still have no right to order them.

164
00:13:46,511 --> 00:13:50,571
But considering that you once saved my life, I'll take one step back.

165
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,011
I, Qin Sang, make an oath on the gold token of my family

166
00:14:01,011 --> 00:14:03,220
to keep an agreement with Lu Ping.

167
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:08,799
We will recover our qualifications and continue the unfinished third round.

168
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:12,571
The result will determine Ling Ziyan's life.

169
00:14:12,571 --> 00:14:14,931
If you win, you can take her.

170
00:14:14,931 --> 00:14:16,831
If I win,

171
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,311
I'll take her life by myself.

172
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,211
As you wish!

173
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,000
Miss.

174
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,580
My brother is tracing the case of Xinghua House,

175
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,871
so I make decisions for my family.

176
00:14:34,871 --> 00:14:37,571
General Wen, don't you trust me?

177
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,860
I will comply.

178
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:47,971
Lu Ping, I'm trying my best to be benevolent.

179
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:51,991
Now, it's up to fate whether she'll live or die.

180
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,740
Okay.

181
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,351
Let's fight another round, then.

182
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:01,971
Xifan, Su Tang, keep an eye on Miss Ling.

183
00:15:01,971 --> 00:15:06,651
Make sure she's safe before the result is announced.

184
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,060
Don't move!

185
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,860
Watch it more closely!

186
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,320
Strange!

187
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,080
Miss has so many loopholes.

188
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,540
She seems to try to find a chance.

189
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,860
Little fool!

190
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,331
Do you really think you can cheat me?

191
00:16:17,331 --> 00:16:19,860
You don't want to kill Ling Ziyan in the first place.

192
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,211
You are the one being softhearted.

193
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,891
So let me be the bad guy.

194
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:38,111
Cooperate well and finish the acting!

195
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:10,720
Little fool, forgive me!

196
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,880
If there's a chance in the future, I'll fight you again.

197
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:21,521
I, Qin Sang, admit to be the defeat of the bet.

198
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,700
Ling Ziyan, you may go!

199
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:37,971
I'll kill you if I meet you in the future.

200
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,779
Lu Ping, you won! You are the champion of the Pneuma Combat Convention.

201
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,239
Good job, Lu Ping! Lu Ping!

202
00:17:50,239 --> 00:17:52,519
Lu Ping, good job!

203
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:54,711
You are the champion!

204
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:04,790
♫ This passing time, it has feinted my life. ♫

205

♫ We've exchanged our promises. ♫

206
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:15,950
♫ This foolish love, this vivid life, ♫

207
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:19,900
♫ with the twilight, I disperse some dreams. ♫

208
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:26,360
♫ Every teardrop is a star! ♫

209
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:33,550
♫ Every teardrop is a star! ♫

210
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:53,700
The Qin family has a great influence in Kaifeng but here, we have Master Chu Min.

211
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,011
No one would dare to touch you.

212
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,971
- Master Chu Min!
- Master Chu Min!

213
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,800
Thank you, Young Master Lu.

214
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:11,570
- I'll try my best to serve Master Chu Min.
- Don't!

215
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:15,451
You take care of your own trouble.

216
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,820
Miss Ling,

217
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:36,891
from now on, you are no longer a maid servant of anyone.

218
00:19:36,891 --> 00:19:39,331
You can do whatever you want.

219
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,131
What if the thing I want to do is...

220
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:52,591
just to follow you around.

221
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:55,571
With so many things at hand,

222
00:19:55,571 --> 00:19:57,851
no one answers that fast.

223
00:19:57,851 --> 00:19:59,811
Take your time to think about it!

224
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,331
Young Master Lu,

225
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:14,131
will Miss be punished for letting me go?

226
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:15,991
Don't worry!

227
00:20:15,991 --> 00:20:19,580
As for her trouble, leave that to me.

228
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:39,390
[No anger in one's heart.]
[No bias in one's heart, learn to nurture.]
[No selfishness in one's heart, love and respect.]

229
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:33,100
Brother, I lost my bet so I'm copy our family disciplines and rules.

230
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,771
Why does it look like you don't believe me?

231
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,571
You took your punishment already, I have nothing else to say.

232
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,640
Sang'er, how about this,

233
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,379
I will go and find another servant to protect your sword? What do you think?

234
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,380
No need!

235
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:03,391
I think I'm better on my own.

236
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,460
General!

237
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,119
General, we can't find Ling Ziyan in the city.

238
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:19,011
Maybe she got hidden by Lu Ping.

239
00:22:19,011 --> 00:22:20,399
Then, continue to find her!

240
00:22:20,399 --> 00:22:23,731
As for Lu Ping, I must...

241
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:34,340
Leave it! The competition is over and he's a winner.

242
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:37,999
As long as he can render a service to Shuo Kingdom, he is a diamond in the rough.

243
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,720
Let him be!

244
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,860
Yes.

245
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,471
Learn to use the front gate in the future.

246
00:22:59,471 --> 00:23:01,460
You are the champion now.

247
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,791
I already put Miss Ling in a proper place.

248
00:23:07,791 --> 00:23:11,611
For things like this, no front gate can be used.

249
00:23:11,611 --> 00:23:15,111
I don't need to know where she is.

250
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,200
Tell her to take good care of herself.

251
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,060
I heard you got punished by your brother.

252
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:28,911
I deceived him, I should be punished.

253
00:23:28,911 --> 00:23:31,211
You reached your goal.

254
00:23:31,211 --> 00:23:34,131
No need to come and laugh at me.

255
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,980
Now that we deceived your brother together,

256
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:44,511
then I should take half of your punishment.

257
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:55,099
My brother is not blind! Your calligraphy looks nothing similar to mine.

258
00:23:55,099 --> 00:23:57,000
You should write like this.

259
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,330
[No anger in one's heart.]

You pervert!

268
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:52,011
This time in Kaifeng, you truly helped a lot.

269
00:24:52,011 --> 00:24:56,360
But you come from a noble family, I guess you need nothing like my appreciation.

270
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,660
I remember my hometown had a field of flowers when I was a child.

271
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:04,391
It's different from what we have in Kaifeng.

272
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,991
After I unlock the Pneuma Confinement,

273
00:25:07,991 --> 00:25:11,911
I plan to go back home, growing flowers and plants.

274
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,760
I'll invite you to come with me.

275
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,660
What do you think?

276
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:21,071
What's attractive in a village?

277
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,500
Never mind, then!

278
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,391
Miss, may I refill the water for you?

279
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,419
No need! Nothing is needed here.

280
00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:32,020
Yes.

281
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,051
He left just like that?

282
00:25:41,051 --> 00:25:43,291
I didn't say I won't go.

283
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,500
[Gongchui Temple]

284
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:14,240
You won the competition, so you belong to the royal court.

285
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,591
Salute to Your Majesty.

286
00:26:16,591 --> 00:26:19,191
May you be in good health, Your Majesty!

287
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:29,889
It's common for these young man from the pugilist world to know nothing about court etiquette.

288
00:26:29,889 --> 00:26:33,271
You four are all excellent young people, each one of the kind.

289
00:26:33,271 --> 00:26:34,620
Come!

290
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:39,291
Tell me! What title or reward do you want?

291
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,791
Please, Your Majesty,

292
00:26:43,791 --> 00:26:47,560
with little ability and morality, I think nothing about title or reward.

293
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,051
I'll go wherever my brother goes.

294
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,791
I'll go wherever Su Tang goes.

295
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,271
You are Lu Ping?

296
00:27:03,271 --> 00:27:06,571
I've heard about you many times.

297
00:27:06,571 --> 00:27:10,099
Where do you come from? Who are your parents?

298
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:14,239
Your Majesty, my parents died in a war.

299
00:27:14,239 --> 00:27:16,660
Now I'm all alone.

300
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:18,811
I stay in the pugilist world.

301
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,291
Neither humble, nor pushy! Very courageous!

302
00:27:25,291 --> 00:27:27,851
No wonder you are the champion of the convention.

303
00:27:27,851 --> 00:27:29,500
Now I entitle you—

304
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:33,200
Your Majesty, title is of no importance.

305
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:38,660
We worked so hard to win the competition, may I ask for some money as the reward first?

306
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,111
Eldest Senior, did he get possessed by Guo Youdao?

307
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:04,020
I didn't expect that after cultivating you guys for many years; finally,

308
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:06,971
they got put into use.

309
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:11,080
I've seen a lot money during my life.

310
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:14,219
But-but-but for this large amount, this is my first time.

311
00:28:14,219 --> 00:28:16,700
My eyes are dazzled.

312
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:20,900
Master, are these enough to build even ten Towers of Martial Art?

313
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,199
Don't mention the Tower of Martial Art in the future!

314
00:28:23,199 --> 00:28:24,580
What are you talking about?

315
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:28,380
Don't forget! Even what you are wearing right now is also at my expense.

316
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,611
Remember to return them to me later!

317
00:28:30,611 --> 00:28:35,811
I should mark every silver and count.

318
00:28:35,811 --> 00:28:37,480
Lu Ping,

319
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,651
were you serious in the court today?

320
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,630
Do you really have to leave?

321
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:47,570
I should follow uncle Wen to go back to my master.

322
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:54,391
Eldest Senior, merry meet, merry part.

323
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,191
It's about time!

324
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:03,411
Besides, I need to try to break the chain lock,

325
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,780
right?

326
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:12,371
Once I break the chain lock, I'll regain my freedom.

327
00:29:12,371 --> 00:29:16,191
Eldest Senior, you can go back to the Wind Takers, without any worry.

328
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,511
Master already has the money for his retirement

329
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,300
and we all hold our original aspiration.

330
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:26,451
Isn't this the best result?

331
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,580
Brother,

332
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,331
Master Wen came looking for you.

333
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,940
Master, what's the matter?

334
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:43,079
No-Nothing! Yes-Yesterday, I drank too much.

335
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:47,519
I-I have a headache! I-I-I'll go and rest for a bit.

336
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:55,739
Strange! When did Master feel uncomfortable in front of money, even need to rest?

337
00:29:55,739 --> 00:29:58,819
Did he take the wrong medicine? Or did he encounter a ghost?

338
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,260
Uncle Wen.

339
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,940
Uncle Wen,

340
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:41,131
I was so rash that day and got you into trouble.

341
00:30:41,131 --> 00:30:42,660
It doesn't matter.

342
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:45,299
I've heard about your encounter with the emperor.

343
00:30:45,299 --> 00:30:47,971
You needn't worry about the title.

344
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:52,451
I will talk to General Qin to see if he can help decline.

345
00:30:54,520 --> 00:31:00,119
Since everything is done here, Su Tang and I can go with you immediately.

346
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:04,939
There's one thing that should be handled properly

347
00:31:04,939 --> 00:31:08,711
before you and I can truly be at ease.

348
00:31:08,711 --> 00:31:11,280
That day, you and I met at Xinghua House.

349
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,591
I didn't tell anybody else.

350
00:31:13,591 --> 00:31:16,231
So why would the Mountain and Sea Gang know?

351
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:21,111
Have you ever thought that someone around you might let out the secret?

352
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,739
You only told me, Eldest Senior, and our companions,

353
00:31:31,739 --> 00:31:34,751
about your meeting with Uncle Wen at Xinghua House.

354
00:31:34,751 --> 00:31:37,340
If the Mountain and Sea Gang came to attack,

355
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:41,031
then who leaked out the information.

356
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,111
There's only one person

357
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:48,479
who knows your time and place of the meeting with Uncle Wen,

358
00:31:48,479 --> 00:31:50,931
and who is not with us.

359
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:58,500
Ping'er, a man's heart is incomprehensible.

360
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,311
People all say that I'm the most careful

361
00:32:01,311 --> 00:32:04,160
but I still fail to see through people's heart.

362
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:09,151
You're born to be smart, so you should know this before I do.

363
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,600
Uncle Wen,

364
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,291
we are going to leave anyways,

365
00:32:18,291 --> 00:32:22,140
- can't we just leave that behind?
- No.

366
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:27,111
Ping'er, don't be such a fool in front of sentiment.

367
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:29,699
If there's someone who belong to the Mountain and Sea Gang around you,

368
00:32:29,699 --> 00:32:32,351
then no matter where you and Su Tang hide,

369
00:32:32,351 --> 00:32:36,031
you can never be free of their trace.

370
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:41,211
We are leaving tomorrow.

371
00:32:41,211 --> 00:32:44,091
Solve everything in a quick manner.

372
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:01,140
Master,

373
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:04,251
what are you hiding?

374
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:18,480
Impossible! Master can't belong to the Mountain and Sea Gang.

375
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:22,320
Lu Ping, after spending so many years with Master,

376
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,579
don't you know him well enough? How can you suspect him?

377
00:33:25,579 --> 00:33:27,851
Uncle Wen is right,

378
00:33:27,851 --> 00:33:30,280
people's heart is incomprehensible.

379
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:34,700
It took you so many years to know me, how dare you to say you truly know Master?

380
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:38,471
Just now, you also saw that Master was so abnormal.

381
00:33:38,471 --> 00:33:40,020
I don't need to know about him.

382
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:45,179
You would have died a hundred times if he belongs to the Mountain and Sea Gang for the past three years.

383
00:33:45,179 --> 00:33:48,031
I don't allow anybody to suspect him.

384
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:54,091
Eldest Senior, Brother is just considering this as it stands.

385
00:33:54,091 --> 00:33:59,831
Master is indeed injured and the injured time happens to be coincidental.

386
00:33:59,831 --> 00:34:05,199
What's more, just now, Master truly looks like he is afraid of being found out.

387
00:34:05,199 --> 00:34:09,259
Stop talking like this! No matter how much you say, it's only your own imagination.

388
00:34:09,259 --> 00:34:12,379
Lu Ping, can you trust me one more time?

389
00:34:12,379 --> 00:34:14,959
Don't touch Master yet, and don't tell anybody else.

390
00:34:14,959 --> 00:34:17,359
I'll definitely find evidence to proove that Master is innocent.

391
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:18,860
Sure!

392
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:25,481
Let's find evidence respectively and see who is right.

393
00:34:25,481 --> 00:34:27,160
Okay.

394
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:39,040
Brother, what should we do now?

395
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,811
Su Tang,

396
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:47,111
I would want to believe, more than anyone else in the world, that Master is a good person.

397
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,491
Go and find Mo Lin!

398
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,711
Su Tang, you finally see my charms and treat me this meal.

399
00:34:59,711 --> 00:35:02,799
I ask you to come here because of the well-known Apricot Blossom Wine,

400
00:35:02,799 --> 00:35:04,619
which belongs to Xinghua House's secret wine.

401
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:07,760
Master told me that he never had the chance to come and taste.

402
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:12,231
So I want to bring some back to him after we finish eating.

403
00:35:12,231 --> 00:35:15,399
This Old Guo must lying to you again, he must have tasted this wine before.

404
00:35:15,399 --> 00:35:17,471
Sniff more carefully!

405
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:32,440
If I make mistakes, how can I teach you in the future?

406
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,779
There's definitely this smell on him.

407
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:37,011
He must have had come here before.

408
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:44,691
Su Tang, you also invited Lu Ping?

409
00:35:44,691 --> 00:35:48,740
With the smell of incense here, I can smell him.

410
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:50,531
Moreover,

411
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,071
it's coming closer.

412
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,599
Brother, why does Master keep secrets from us?

413
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,851
Is he truly the one?

414
00:36:10,851 --> 00:36:14,471
The one who attacked the Xinghua House and injured himself.

415
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,800
Su Tang,

416
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,500
I don't want to believe this, either.

417
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:23,671
Can we give Master one last chance?

418
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,600
Minmin,

419
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:47,191
in the middle of the night,

420
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,659
what are you doing in my room?

421
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:53,679
You never drink this much, why are you so drunk today?

422
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:58,260
Tell me! Is there any secret you're hiding from me?

423
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,201
Look at me!

424
00:37:02,201 --> 00:37:04,220
Bad news!

425
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:09,099
Ling Ziyan relapses her injury, Xifan ask me to find Master Chu Min but I can't find her.

426
00:37:09,099 --> 00:37:11,171
Master Chu Min is here.

427
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:19,331
Minmin, please, if you have to save someone, save them till the end. Go back, please!

428
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:52,860
Luckily, the nail holds the errhysis

429
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:55,671
and there's little smell of the blood.

430
00:37:55,671 --> 00:37:59,531
Everything will be over after tonight.

431
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:25,811
Master, with such beautiful moonlight, let's raise a glass or two.

432
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:32,431
Tianqi, wake up!

433
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,340
Master Wei.

434
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:40,731
Miss Qin, may I help you in such a late night?

435
00:38:40,731 --> 00:38:45,051
In Chan State before, Young Lord Wei helped me a lot.

436
00:38:45,051 --> 00:38:48,931
Now I heard he got badly injured, so I came to visit him.

437
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:54,631
I know that Young Lord Wei was very kind to me before,

438
00:38:54,631 --> 00:38:59,411
so maybe my company will help him to wake up.

439
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:09,119
Master Wei, can I be here with him alone?

440
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:11,611
Please give us some time.

441
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:15,251
Okay, okay.

442
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,139
Thanks a lot for receiving my message and coming here to help.

443
00:39:36,139 --> 00:39:41,380
It is Lu Ping that I'm helping; otherwise, who cares about the Wind Taker Institute.

444
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:47,711
Does your Master really belongs to the Mountain and Sea Gang?

445
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:52,780
At the moment, maybe only he knows the truth.

446
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:54,771
But he...

447
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,980
Wei Tianqi.

448
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:07,100
What's this?

449
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,931
This shape?

450
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:14,780
Ziyan.

451
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,871
Mountain and Sea Gang?

452
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:44,851
Isn't Master going to see me off?

453
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:48,941
Better to keep the wine in your heart than in your mouth.

454
00:40:48,941 --> 00:40:51,371
I quit drinking recently.

455
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:56,059
But this is the Apricot Blossom Wine of Xinghua House.

456
00:40:56,059 --> 00:40:59,079
It's really a shame if you don't taste some.

457
00:40:59,079 --> 00:41:01,220
You went to Xinghua House?

458
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:07,119
It resumes business today.

459
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:11,171
To solicit business, the owner invited a storyteller.

460
00:41:11,171 --> 00:41:14,731
That storyteller told a very ridiculous story.

461
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:18,771
Master, do you want to listen?

462
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:29,651
The story started out on such a night like this.

463
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:34,171
With a bright moon,

464
00:41:34,171 --> 00:41:36,971
a hunter's home got caught on fire.

465
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:42,391
A fox who was to be killed and skinned

466
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:46,051
seized the opportunity to escape.

467
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:48,771
It was bleeding.

468
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,651
It ran and ran,

469
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:56,331
and got saved by a farmer.

470
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:00,799
The fox had trusted no human kind before.

471
00:42:00,799 --> 00:42:04,151
But this farmer offered it a place to heal its wound.

472
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:07,351
The fox was so thankful.

473
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:12,810
But just at the time when the fox recovered,

474
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:16,171
and was about to bid farewell to the farmer,

475
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:21,231
it discovered that the farmer was sharpening his knife.

476
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:25,131
It turned out that he was the same as the hunter.

477
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:28,300
They were waiting for the fox to heal its wound.

478
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:34,851
Because a wounded fur is worthless.

479
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:38,731
It is the fox's first time to trust human being

480
00:42:38,731 --> 00:42:41,191
and it chose the wrong person.

481
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,671
Will you say this fox is dumb?

482
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,091
Lu Ping.

483
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,511
I just don't understand.

484
00:43:10,511 --> 00:43:15,539
The farmer disguised himself for so long, just for the fur of the fox.

485
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,991
Master, what are you in disguise for then?

[Ending OST: "The Paper Boat"]
[by Zhiqian Xue — Singers: Zhiqian Xue and Kewei Yu]

487
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:46,500
♫ Waiting to be buried by the lake in the town, ♫

488
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:52,590
♫ the White Paper Boat drifting with sorrow. ♫

489
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:58,340
♫ Lights on the other side of the sea ♫

490
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:06,950
♫ punched fingertips in the red water tower. ♫

491
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:16,490
♫ Watch the little boat churning, laughing at the ordinariness. ♫

492
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:20,810
♫ Like a kite being pulled into a low altitude, ♫

493
00:44:20,810 --> 00:44:26,210
♫ I smiled to the leaving person. ♫

494
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:30,530
♫ The more spotlight, the more vivid the story. ♫

495
00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:35,510
♫ Laughing like the moon, ♫

496
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:39,960
♫ regretting the lighthouse broke in the waves, ♫

497
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:47,620
♫ I call the Milky Way that isolates us all, blue. ♫

498
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:54,700
♫ Like a moat built under the sea, ♫

499
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:59,460
♫ waiting for the words on the paper boat to disappear, ♫

500
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:06,690
♫ there must always be someone who doesn’t remember listening to the other. ♫

501
00:45:08,590 --> 00:45:14,120
♫ Anyone who is correctly guessed will end in disfavor. ♫

502
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:18,300
♫ You are particularly touched but others consider it ordinary. ♫

503
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:23,710
♫ Like the author, roughly put down with a weak stroke, ♫

504
00:45:23,710 --> 00:45:28,090
♫ the writing boat on the lake was just like a paper crane in the air. ♫

505
00:45:28,090 --> 00:45:32,930
♫ Laughing like the moon, ♫

506
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:37,560
♫ regretting the lighthouse broke in the waves, ♫

507
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:45,830
♫ I call the Milky Way that isolates us all, blue. ♫

508
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:52,510
♫ Can a moat be built on the seabed? ♫

509
00:45:52,510 --> 00:45:56,970
♫ Wipe all the words on the paper boat! ♫

510
00:45:56,970 --> 00:46:04,430
♫ Please let someone not remember and don't tell another! ♫

511
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:11,410
♫ Hide the reluctance between words ♫

512
00:46:11,410 --> 00:46:16,060
♫ Unfortunately, I (you) are an average author ♫

513
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:24,060
♫ No matter how you (I) describe the rest, it's unnecessary! ♫

514
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:34,440
♫ Don't describe my unfulfilled promise! ♫

515
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:43,280
♫ Don't interpret my hidden fire-smoke! ♫

516
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:52,290
♫ Don't let the paper boat in the rough wave chasing me! ♫

517
00:46:52,290 --> 00:47:00,840
♫ Don't wait until it's over to know there are you and me! ♫
