♫ The dark green sea is hazy ♫

29
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,660
I still have something else to tell you, Father.

30
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:29,820
In order to cover for me, Miss Ling was tortured by the Mountain and Sea Gang.

31
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,530
She's had a miserable upbringing.

32
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:36,340
I feel for her. I hope she can find shelter with Wuji Manor.

33
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,319
She indeed deserves merit this time.

34
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,800
Wuji Manor can surely give her a home.

35
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,300
I'll let you handle it.

36
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,020

Lu Ping, let's talk.

39
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,699
Don't bother! He has already run off.

40
00:03:07,699 --> 00:03:11,519
We were looking for him, too. Instead, we found this letter in his room.

41
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,240
He was long gone when we went down the mountain after him.

42
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,859
Things in the world are complicated.

43
00:03:16,859 --> 00:03:20,860
There's a lot I still don't understand or not know how to deal with.

44

Senior Huo Ying also saw Miss Ling just now.

48
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:46,019
She seemed really out of it as she headed for the back mountain.

49
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:49,559
We were trying to guess what you did wrong

50
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,900
to make her that sad.

51
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:04,140
Do you know that the Yan Family is a noble family in the martial arts world?

52
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:08,000
No matter how much Yan Xifan likes you, all is just wishful thinking.

53
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,940
Who you are, is not suitable for him.

54
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:16,300
If you stay with Yan Xifan and inform me of the moves of the Yan Family,

55
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:20,040
I will give you a suitable identity

56

and guarantee a perfect future for you and Yan Xifan.

60
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,720
I was going to come and find you.

61
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,620
I was looking for you, too.

62
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,340
Father has already agreed that you can come with us to Wuji Manor.

63

You don't want to?

64
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:12,440
Oh right! You just said you were looking for me.

65

Did you have something to say?

66
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:20,260
The world is so big, there's really nowhere else for me to go.

67
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,980
I have been wishing that Young Master Xifan would take me on.

68
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,660
Even just to serve as a maid for cooking and cleaning, it would be fine.

69
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,300
I can also be your training partner.

it would be great if I could stay by your side.

That's great! I will go tell my father right now.

Lu Ping went alone to the Wind Taker Institute for mourning.

I saw how upset he was so I'm worried about him.

I want to go to Chenqiao to comfort him

78

and also pay respects to our master.

79

It's a deal then! You haven't recovered yet.

He swore to be loyal to his death.

162
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:49,340
The responsibilities are so heavy to bear.

163
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:57,900
♫ It still shines and reflects on me a thin outline ♫

164
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,340
But you shouldered these

165
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,900
heavy responsibilities for years.

166
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:12,820
♫ Forever stay in my heart ♫

167
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,560
Now,

168
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,100
it is my turn.

169
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,380
♫ It stays anchored in my heart ♫

170
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:34,740
[Wind Taker Institute]

171
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,839
Shouldn't you be returning more gloriously as an official?

172
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,100
Why did you come back by yourself?

173
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,670
There's something I don't understand

174
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,680
but I don't know whom to ask.

175
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,400
So I came to talk with master.

176
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:59,519
That old man! Besides, "Let it be" and "How much is it", what else would he say?

177
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,920
You're better off asking me.

178
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,680
Do you know why master used to always hide from you?

179
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,220
Entertain me!

180
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,919
Your non-stop chit-chating.

181
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,780
If he married you, it would've been like marrying ten women.

182
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,420
He couldn't handle it.

183
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,639
You brat! Making fun of me, are you?

184
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,699
Clean the handrail for me. Don't just stand idling there!

185
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,040
What's that?

186
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:04,379
In September, the First year of Tianyou, I stole 300 taels of silver from a corrupted official.

187
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:07,680
My older brother found out and gave me a beating.

188
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,820
At least, he gave me 20 taels for my medicine,

189
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,140
so I was satisfied.

190
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:16,040
So, it's Old Guo's old account book?

191
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:20,239
That old man! His trait for lusting after money didn't changed one bit over the years.

192
00:16:20,239 --> 00:16:24,419
In Autumn, Second Year of Tianyou, my eldest brother and my sister-in-law died, so I left my sect.

193
00:16:24,419 --> 00:16:27,340
Stole two lanterns from the Astronomical Observatory.

194
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,680
Pawned them for 800 taels of silver.

195
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,860
In Winter, Third Year of Tianyou, I stole a gold hair clasp from the No.1 prostitute and gave it to Minmin.

196
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:44,340
Minmin was sad about the death of Little Liu so she kicked me.

197
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,720
The hair clasp costs 100 taels of silver.

198
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,600
Hurry, keep reading!

199
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,959
In Spring, First Year of Guangshu, I founded the Wind Taker Institute.

200
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,960
It costs me 400 taels.

201
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,359
Owed Jin Ruyu 200 on credit.

202
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,180
If he hadn't mentioned, I would've forgotten it.

203
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:04,940
This old man, he didn't even return what he owed me or the fees for his wine.

204
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,199
Also, who is that Minmin?

205
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,069
Who is that No. 1 prostitute?

206
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,810
Have you heard of her before?

207
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:18,899
In Summer, Second Year of Guangshu, I bet with Minmin to go into the palace to steal

208
00:17:18,899 --> 00:17:21,039
a jade burial suit.

209
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,519
Sold it for 1000 taels.

210
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,950
Discovered a royal document by chance.

211
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:27,140
It said Little Liu was...

212
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,390
the prince of Dan.

213
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:33,220
[The Zhai thief destroyed my country and disgraced my sect. This hatred must be avenged. If the Big Dipper is going to be used by the Zhai thief, then this sect is no longer for me.]

214
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:37,700
The Zhai thief destroyed my country and disgraced my sect.

215
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,120
This grudge must be avenged.

216
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,990
[This grudge must be avenged.]

217
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,460
That means master had known all along.

218
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,620
Lu Ping, what's wrong with you?

219
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,440
Who is Little Liu?

220
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,160
What did Old Guo do?

221
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,080
I am not a good master.

222
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,640
Some of your questions,

223
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:38,860
I don't have answers for, either.

224
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:43,160
Some other of your questions, I do know

225
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,640
but dare not think deeper.

226
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,420
Master,

227
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:55,040
what exactly did you discover?

228
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,240
Why weren't you willing to tell me?

229
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,240
Lu Ping?

230
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,380
Eldest Senior, why are you here?

231
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,579
I am worried about you so I came to see you.

232
00:19:09,579 --> 00:19:12,080
What's wrong? Why are you so upset?

233
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,340
Look at this!

234
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,440
I found it in the Wind Taker Institute.

235
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,660
The account book of our master.

236
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,920
He had long ago known the identity of Liu Song.

237
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,820
Considering his whereabouts these past few years,

238
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:33,040
he must have had been hunting for information.

239
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:36,260
However, for some reason, he stopped after I came to Wind Taker.

240
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,479
Now that Master Chu Min is missing

241
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,180
and the words Liu Song left are ambiguous.

242
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,780
I don't have any leads.

243
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,600
Why don't you come back to Wuji Manor with me.

244
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,260
Look at the last page!

245
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:57,239
In Autumn, Second Year of Xiande, I still couldn't find Old Qi.

246
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,039
I went to see second brother at Wuji Manor.

247
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,220
I wanted to steal the double swords for money.

248
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,919
Yet I saw second brother drinking with soldiers of Jin.

249
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,280
I paid 50 taels for the drinks.

250
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,080
You mean…

251
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,340
Master and father are from the same sect.

252
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,340
They may have talked about some things.

253
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,020
We can ask my father first.

254
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:19,220
We can inquire about the Mountain and Sea Gang with the help of Wuji Manor.

255
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:22,300
If you want to investigate it, I'll do it with you.

256
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,119
Okay.

257
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,460
You're offering me accommodation and food.

258
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:28,940
It would be silly to reject it.

259
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,520
Yan Jin?

260
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,140
Where am I?

261
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,360
The Mountain and Sea Gang.

262
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:43,740
It seems that you're planning to imprison me here

263
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:46,240
and force me to listen to Liu Song.

264
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,760
Dream on!

265
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,839
Trust me!

266
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:54,340
I didn't want to bring you here, either.

267
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:58,280
But Master couldn't bear to leave you behind.

268
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:03,540
He can't bear to leave me behind and yet he imprisons me here.

269
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:05,760
Isn't he being hypocritical?

270
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,160
You feel pained being locked up here?

271
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,320
However, because you framed the Mountain and Sea Gang,

272
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:17,820
the master is experiencing thousands, ten thousands times the pain you have.

273
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:21,640
Framed?

274
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,860
What do you mean?

275
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:30,220
You, upright sects, are more cruel

276
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:34,240
than the Mountain and Sea Gang when you commit evil deeds.

277
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,599
This time, when the Mountain and Sea Gang was fighting against the Big Dipper.

278
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,359
Master refused to be ruthless.

279
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,680
He definitely showed mercy.

280
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:46,620
So, you need to die.

281
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,160
Stop!

282
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,000
Master, relationships are just a burden.

283
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,860
You are the future of Dan.

284
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:05,240
You can't have any weaknesses or soft spots.

285
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,160
It is only a soft spot if I care about her.

286
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,820
She's just a pawn to take advantage of.

287
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,100
Leader, please have a look.

288
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:26,700
Chief took it back for us to open it

289
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:30,120
and take out the commander's seal.

290
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:33,920
However, we haven't been able destroy the Thousand Pine Ruler

291
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,820
no matter what we try.

292
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,180
How could this be?

293
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,920
Back then, Leng Xiutan asked Lu Chenfeng to seal

294
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:47,320
the commander's seal in the Thousand Pine Ruler to restrain me.

295
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:51,899
It is said that no one can open the lock created by Lu's Pneuma of Energy.

296
00:23:51,899 --> 00:23:53,940
It seems to be true.

297
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,920
So the only way to open it,

298
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,460
is to find Lu Chengfeng.

299
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,980
After you left the Big Dipper,

300
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:07,510
Lu Chengfeng was also nowhere to be found.

301
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:11,740
Maybe he has already died.

302
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,620
This time, I went to the Big Dipper,

303
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:19,240
is to visit the Astronomical Observatory personally.

304
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,260
As one of the Seven of the Big Dipper, Lu's Star of Destiny is still bright.

305
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:35,320
He is still alive.

306
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:40,860
In order to take advantage of people from the Big Dipper, we need a hostage, don't we?

307
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:46,420
I had to give up relationships for my country and my family.

308
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:49,060
It was I who didn't understand your intentions.

309
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,860
- I was wrong and deserve to die.
- Teacher,

310
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:54,540
the task of finding Lu Chenfeng,

311
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,920
is something that I can entrust to only you.

312
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:03,100
All these years, Zhai has invaded the land of Dan.

313
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:06,660
I will personally get the land back, bit by bit.

314
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:14,379
Master, Chu Min has heard our secret now.

315
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:18,160
Shall I do something to stop her from speaking out?

316
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:22,560
Don't bother! She can't go anywhere anyway.

317
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,620
What does Yan Jin mean?

318
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:32,860
Who hurt you so badly that you're like this today!

319
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:37,680
You will understand when I open the Thousand Pine Ruler.

320
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,090
Miss, they're all males in the army.

321
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:48,190
Why do you have to make it hard on yourself?

322
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,020
The Agile Dragon Army's morale is weak.

323
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:56,760
If I don't go, I would be letting my brother down.

324
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,639
How long have you followed General Qin?

325
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:40,119
It has been three years since I joined the Agile Dragon Army and followed General Qin.

326
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:46,760
Can he come back from the dead if you indulge yourself in sadness?

327
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,000
I know you all respect my brother.

328
00:26:55,900 --> 00:27:00,340
But don't forget! You are soldiers of Shuo.

329
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:03,920
The people of Shuo are your only faith.

330
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,860
If just because of the death of one person,

331
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:10,630
you've become depressed and delayed all of the affairs in the army.

332
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:12,880
What right to you have to be called the Agile Dragon Army?!

333
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,330
Okay, I'll obey you.

334
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:17,860
We won't ruin the reputation of the Agile Dragon Army!

335
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:22,339
We won't ruin the reputation of the Agile Dragon Army! We won't ruin the reputation of the Agile Dragon Army!

336
00:27:22,339 --> 00:27:26,799
Won't ruin the reputation of the Agile Dragon Army! Won't ruin the reputation of the Agile Dragon Army!

337
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:30,499
We won't ruin the reputation of the Agile Dragon Army! We won't ruin the reputation of the Agile Dragon Army!

338
00:27:30,499 --> 00:27:32,399
- Go on.
- Yes.

339
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,359
Miss, His Majesty just issued a decree

340
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:40,220
stating that you've been conferred the title of Princess Xining.

341
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:42,500
Please head to the palace now, to thank His Majesty in person.

342
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:46,440
Why did His Majesty bestow me that title out of the blue?

343
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,900
[Hanging Arch Hall]

344
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,560
Your subject greets Your Majesty.

345
00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:01,040
I dare not receive such a grand title since I haven't made any contributions.

346
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:08,620
You know about the Thousand Pine Ruler, don't you?

347
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:11,160
General Wen did tell me about it.

348
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:14,719
I know the Liu Family in Hedong will surely do something this time.

349
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,399
I heard the morale of the Agile Dragon Army was low, so I went to the barracks with General Wen.

350
00:28:19,399 --> 00:28:21,680
I hoped to improve their spirits.

351
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,830
You have a lot of loyalty.

352
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:29,980
But I hope to stop the war before it happens.

353
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,879
Young master of Wuji Manor, Yan Xifan,

354
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,159
is a skilled and virtuous young hero.

355
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,860
I hereby grant him ten thousand gold.

356
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:49,499
The brother and sister of the Qin Family are good at literature and martial arts. They should be awarded for saving His Majesty.

357
00:28:49,499 --> 00:28:54,479
I confer Qin Sang the title of Princess Xining to show my grace.

358
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,040
I bestow the marriage of Qin Sang to Yan Xifan.

359
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,939
Your Majesty! Your Majesty, why have you done this?

360
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:06,460
Leng Xiutan asked Lu Chenfeng to seal the

361
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:10,000
commander's seal in the Thousand Pine Ruler.

362
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:15,359
For Liu Song to get his seal, he must find Lu Chenfeng.

363
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:20,980
Yet, that person is still missing.

364
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:25,460
Master of Wuji Manor, Yan Qiuci is also one of Seven of Big Dipper.

365
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:28,320
He must know something.

366
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,740
The war can start at any time.

367
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:36,380
We must have Wuji Manor on our side in order to protect our land.

368
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:40,380
Your Majesty, do you want the Mountain and Sea Gang to fall into a trap?

369
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:49,980
I will let the Agile Dragon Army

370
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:52,580
escort you in the name of your wedding.

371
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:56,460
You have to inquire about Lu Chenfeng in the Wuji Manor.

372
00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:00,020
If Liu Song is lured by Lu,

373
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:02,200
we can kill both of them at the same time.

374
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:14,600
Then Yan Family and the Big Dipper will join the hands of all sects to eliminate the Mountain and Sea Gang.

375
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:20,080
Considering your identity and experience,

376
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:22,850
you are the most suitable

377
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:30,820
Your Majesty, I am already engaged to Lu Ping.

378
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:33,450
Lu Ping and Yan Xifan are like brothers.

379
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:36,240
Your Majesty want to acquire both of them.

380
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,880
If you bestow my marriage, I'm afraid they may be disappointed.

381
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,940
I have issued the decree...

382
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,640
Do you doubt my judgement?

383
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,240
I dare not.

384
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,859
Lu Ping is from the martial arts world; thus, his actions are eccentric and unpredictable.

385
00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:03,380
As a daughter of the Qin Family, you are loyal.

386
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:06,750
Don't let your emotions ruin important things.

387
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:12,500
Qin Sang, Soaring Dragon General has just died.

388
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:17,310
This is the only chance to destroy the Mountain and Sea Gang.

389
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:22,720
Will you really go against me and your promise just for Lu Ping?

390
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,140
I still have one last request.

391
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:31,820
Please make my wedding magnificent.

392
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:36,300
If you want to attract Liu Song, we have to deceive everyone,

393
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:39,120
including Lu Ping.

394
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,940
I agree.

395
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,800
Thank you, Your Majesty.

396
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,880
Why did it stop all of a sudden?

397
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:12,959
Mo Lin, how do we get into Carefree Valley?

398
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:21,490
You brat! You were just fine a few days ago.

399
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:23,740
How did your injury suddenly get worse?

400
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,300
After all, you hurt yourself because of me.

401
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,860
I can't just let you die at the gate in front your home.

402
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,980
Wait for me!

403
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:45,620
Enter… Master, you can't just rush in like that.

404
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:47,200
It is dangerous.

405
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,900
Oh no! She has gone?

406
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,570
Where is the elder of Carefree Valley?

407
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:29,570
Mo Lin is dying! Hurry to come out and save him.

408
00:33:29,579 --> 00:33:32,480
Who are you? Are you telling the truth?

409
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:36,400
If you don't believe it, then just wait and you can prepare for his funeral.

410
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,759
I am his master so I wouldn't lie to you.

411
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:45,259
Young master is very proud, how could he accept you as his master?

412
00:33:45,259 --> 00:33:48,120
You broke into the valley and are telling tall tales.

413
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,280
Leave immediately!

414
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,080
A bunch of fools!

415
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:56,300
If you won't listen to me, I will go to find your boss.

416
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:05,580
Oh no! Mo Lin, there's poison... in the mist.

417
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:09,539
Master! Master, are you okay? Master.

418
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:12,860
Mo Chuangu, stop your tricks!

419
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:15,399
I've come back. Get out here!

420
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,600
Young Master?
[ Mo Chuangu - Carefree Valley ]

421
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:25,139
Didn't you say that you wouldn't come back before you became the No.1 Assassin?

422
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:29,199
Let's talk about it later. Antidote!

423
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:34,640
You're saving this outsider who broke into the valley?

424
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,390
Is she really your master then?

425
00:34:37,399 --> 00:34:41,740
Look carefully! She is my wife.

426
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:46,140
We almost... poisoned young madam to death.

427
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,959
Is my father here?

428
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:55,320
After you left, master has been so angry, he hasn't come out at all.

429
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:58,479
Then stop standing there. Hurry and take my wife in.

430
00:34:58,479 --> 00:35:01,839
Use the best medicine so that she doesn't get any lingering illnesses.

431
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:05,419
We have to leave before father comes out. Oh right!

432
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,759
Treat me as well, by the way.

433
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,080
Or else, my wife is going to become a widow.

434
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:16,380
Go! Go away! She's my wife, I'll take care of it.

435
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:40,130
[Carefree Valley]

436
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,439
Miss Su, you're awake?

437
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,720
- This is…
- This is Carefree Valley.

438
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,679
I am Mo Chuangu, First Disciple of the valley.

439
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,200
I was with young master when he was growing up.

440
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,879
Where's Mo Lin? Have you saved him?

441
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,319
Don't worry, Miss Su! He wasn't hurt badly.

442
00:36:09,319 --> 00:36:10,839
He woke up earlier than you did.

443
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:15,439
You, however, aren't used to the poison in the mist and have slept for a whole day.

444
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,639
If you need to save me, then just save me, why did you change my clothes?

445
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:23,100
It's the young master who ordered us to do so.

446
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,479
You deserve all the best things.

447
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:29,520
- You've slept for the whole day, do you want to eat something?
- No need!

448
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,719
I'm done escorting Mo Lin here, I have to go back to find my brother.

449
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:40,000
Just a bowl of noodles then.

450
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,519
Carefree Valley is never lacking in medicinal diets.

451
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,040
These were all prepared for you.

452
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,619
Miss Su really has a good appetite.

453
00:36:59,619 --> 00:37:03,560
You are indeed a marvelous girl.

454
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:06,240
This ginger soup was made especially for you.

455
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,240
It can warm you from the cold of the journey.

456
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:14,859
I don't like ginger soup because it is salty and spicy.

457
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,599
There's honey inside?

458
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,279
How did you know I like sweet things?

459
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,839
It was also from young master. He said that you like sweet things.

460
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,680
These were prepared according to your taste.

461
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:33,800
Mo Lin said that Carefree Valley lives in seclusion and never welcome an outsider.

462
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:37,819
Why are you treating me as a guest so well?

463
00:37:37,819 --> 00:37:40,919
You definitely are not a guest but rather, our Carefree Valley Young Madam.

464
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,920
We have to serve you with everything we have.

465
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,120
Young Madam?

466
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,120
D*mn Mo Lin!

467
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,959
Young Master, this is the 300-year-old ginseng which was specially collected by the master.

468
00:37:57,959 --> 00:37:59,840
Add it! Add it!

469
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:03,859
This is an extremely rare ganoderma lucidum that master ordered to be used only for medicine.

470
00:38:03,859 --> 00:38:06,899
Hurry up! Add it, too. Add it, too.

471
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:11,199
Young Master, if you wastefully use up all master's miraculous medicines,

472
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,919
aren't you afraid he'd beat you after he comes out?

473
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,739
Nonsense! He won't be able to catch me.

474
00:38:16,739 --> 00:38:21,140
Moreover, can it be considered wasteful if it's to help my wife?

475
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:23,559
She's good at everything but just a little too thin.

476
00:38:23,559 --> 00:38:25,959
I want to fatten her up and make her happy.

477
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:30,039
If Miss Su is your wife, why won't she admit it?

478
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,599
This is where you don't understand.

479
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,760
She's shy.

480
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:39,890
In fact, she was completely head over heels in love with me early on.

481
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:41,530
She wants to be with me forever.

482
00:38:41,539 --> 00:38:46,000
When she is more familiar with the valley, she'll naturally be more obedient.

483
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,039
What other medicines do we have? Add them all in.

484
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,619
Hurry up! Hurry up!

485
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:54,520
What are you doing?

486
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,840
Master, don't misunderstand!

487
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:05,359
I‘m just boasting a little bit in front of the people from my family.

488
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:08,779
Please forgive me! I made you Osmanthus sugar with a lot of medicine.

489
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:10,400
It'll help you build up your body.

490
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:14,879
Do you know how worried I was that something would happen to you on the way here?

491
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:19,100
Since you have the energy to talk nonsense, you're probably pretty much recovered.

492
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:22,459
Then I won't be staying but going back to look for my brother.

493
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,400
Master!

494
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:30,320
Master! Su Tang!

495
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,540
Su Tang!

496
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,839
Mo Lin, I'm your master.

497
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,080
What are you doing?

498
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:43,099
You don't have strength right now, I… I will bully my teacher today.

499
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:50,479
Su Tang, is it all muscle in your brain?

500
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,880
Don't you know what I want?

501
00:39:55,480 --> 00:40:00,179
Mo Lin, I treat you like a brother from Wind Taker Institute, what do you take me as?

502
00:40:00,179 --> 00:40:04,020
At the Wind Taker Institute, I regarded our boss and Eldest Senior as my brothers.

503
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:07,319
If they are in danger, I'm willing to do anything for them, even if it's to sacrifice my life.

504
00:40:07,319 --> 00:40:09,520
But it's not the same for you.

505
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,980
I'd rather be the one to be in danger, than to see you in danger.

506
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:16,919
Do you understand? I like you. Do you get it?

507
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:24,080
- Like me?
- Yes, I like you.

508
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,479
Not long after entering the Wind Taker Institute, I started liking you.

509
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:32,519
Otherwise, why do you think I, the World's No.1 Assassin, would follow after a little girl like you every day?

510
00:40:32,519 --> 00:40:36,779
- Am I insane?
- Why didn't you say it before?

511
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,780
I wanted to say it.

512
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:44,520
But every time I opened my mouth, it was always at a bad time.

513
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:47,380
Su Tang,

514
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:51,240
you said ever since you were a kid you've never had a home.

515
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,460
I also know that

516
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:56,820
I am not so skilled as Lu Ping or Xifan.

517
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:59,280
However, whatever I have, is yours.

518
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:04,760
Wherever I am, that'll be your home.

519
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,240
I…

520
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:10,980
It doesn't matter if you can't process it right at this moment.

521
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:14,360
You can slowly think about it and slowly consider it.

522
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:22,879
Young Master, if you can't succeed, we have enough drugs here.

523
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,039
You can get her laid first.

524
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:29,540
Then she'll have to agree whether she wants to or not.

525
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:31,440
Su Tang.

526
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,239
Then let me also tell you something.

527
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:38,500
Your drugs aren't as effective as you think.

528
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,959
Su Tang. Su Tang!

529
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,680
Young Master.

530
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:51,300
Mo Chuangu, I should have poisoned you and made you mute.

531
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:54,419
Young Master, did you get osmanthus pollen on your hand?

532
00:41:54,419 --> 00:41:57,899
- How did you hurt your hand?
- Is the hand important?

533
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:01,619
What are you standing there for? Go an get my wife back!

534
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:03,400
Hurry up!

535
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:08,099
D*mn it, Mo Lin! He always bullies me.

536
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,440
Why are there so many Osmanthus flowers here?

537
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:22,279
Say! Isn't Young master allergic to Osmanthus pollen?

538
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:25,039
Why did he write to us and ask us to plant so many Osmanthus trees?

539
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,759
He even personally picked so many blossoms yesterday.

540
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,280
Who knows what he's doing?

541
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:47,820
His hand was hurt just from making Osmanthus sugar for me.

542
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,200
He said he likes me.

543
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:05,860
At least, I have to take a look at his hand.

544
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:12,120
Oh Dear! I'm lost again.

545
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,160
A bird?

546
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,220
Maybe I can find someone to inquire about how to get back.

547
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:34,710
[Ending OST: "The Paper Boat"]
[by Zhiqian Xue — Singers: Zhiqian Xue and Kewei Yu]

548
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:40,860
♫ Waiting to be buried by the lake in the town, ♫

549
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:46,930
♫ the White Paper Boat drifting with sorrow. ♫

550
00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:52,720
♫ Lights on the other side of the sea ♫

551
00:43:52,720 --> 00:44:01,310
♫ punched fingertips in the red water tower. ♫

552
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:10,870
♫ Watch the little boat churning, laughing at the ordinariness. ♫

553
00:44:10,870 --> 00:44:15,090
♫ Like a kite being pulled into a low altitude, ♫

554
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:20,530
♫ I smiled to the leaving person. ♫

555
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:24,920
♫ The more spotlight, the more vivid the story. ♫

556
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:29,820
♫ Laughing like the moon, ♫

557
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:34,300
♫ regretting the lighthouse broke in the waves, ♫

558
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:41,990
♫ I call the Milky Way that isolates us all, blue. ♫

559
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:49,040
♫ Like a moat built under the sea, ♫

560
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:53,860
♫ waiting for the words on the paper boat to disappear, ♫

561
00:44:53,860 --> 00:45:01,770
♫ there must always be someone who doesn’t remember listening to the other. ♫

562
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:08,460
♫ Anyone who is correctly guessed will end in disfavor. ♫

563
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:12,670
♫ You are particularly touched but others consider it ordinary. ♫

564
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:17,990
♫ Like the author, roughly put down with a weak stroke, ♫

565
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:22,490
♫ the writing boat on the lake was just like a paper crane in the air. ♫

566
00:45:22,490 --> 00:45:27,250
♫ Laughing like the moon, ♫

567
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:32,030
♫ regretting the lighthouse broke in the waves, ♫

568
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:40,330
♫ I call the Milky Way that isolates us all, blue. ♫

569
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:46,920
♫ Can a moat be built on the seabed? ♫

570
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:51,280
♫ Wipe all the words on the paper boat! ♫

571
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:58,660
♫ Please let someone not remember and don't tell another! ♫

572
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:05,730
♫ Hide the reluctance between words ♫

573
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:10,380
♫ Unfortunately, I (you) are an average author ♫

574
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:18,060
♫ No matter how you (I) describe the rest, it's unnecessary! ♫

575
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:28,850
♫ Don't describe my unfulfilled promise! ♫

576
00:46:28,850 --> 00:46:37,630
♫ Don't interpret my hidden fire-smoke! ♫

577
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:46,550
♫ Don't let the paper boat in the rough wave chasing me! ♫

578
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:55,190
♫ Don't wait until it's over to know there are you and me! ♫
