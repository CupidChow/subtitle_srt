27
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,579
[Episode 44]

28
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,870
Mo Lin, you brat. You said you'd let me bully you for the rest of your life.

29
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,810
Didn't even keep your promise.

30
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:36,980
What was the point of leaving me here as Young Madam Mo?!

31
00:02:37,659 --> 00:02:39,520
Stupid Liar!

32
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,580
Master Chu Min.

33
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,999
Master Chu Min, why are you here?

34
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,499
Master Chu Min! Master Chu Min!

35
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,999
Master, what's wrong with my master?

36
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,879
She was bitten by a snake.

37
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,630
Now her blood circulation is unstable.

38
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:11,160
But her power of six pneumas is dynamic.

39
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,330
She may use six pneumas now.

40
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:18,380
I'm guessing that the Mountain and Sea Gang found a way to create Force Eaters

41
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:22,670
who can use six pneumas.

42
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,930
Only my brother can do such a thing.

43
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:27,390
Did they find him?

44
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,099
- Master.
- Su Tang.

45
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:49,130
I didn't hear any news about Lu Ping being captured when I was at the Mountain and Sea Gang.

46
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:52,790
I'm afraid he might have encountered some trouble.

47
00:03:52,790 --> 00:04:00,010
I only know that Liu Song been gotten his blood and was using it for research.

48
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,720
Master Mo,

49
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,390
in this bottle is some of Lu Ping's blood.

50
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:19,110
This bottle is some Xi Sui powder that I stole.

51
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,928
Maybe they can help you.

52
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:22,830
Yes, it can! It can!

53
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:26,259
This is help right when we need it. Great. Great.
(T/N: lit. getting charcoal when it's snowing)

54
00:04:26,259 --> 00:04:28,930
With these two items and some more time,

55
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:31,650
I'll be able to create an antidote easily.

56
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:34,230
You two go ahead and talk.

57
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:36,310
This is great.

58
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:43,890
Master, were you hurt because you were trying to bring those here?

59
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,819
My disciple's made mistakes.

60
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:48,970
It's up to the master to clean up the mess.

61
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:53,110
Now, it is not safe in Carefree Valley anymore.

62
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:57,870
I'm worried Liu Song may follow me here.

63
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:01,030
The Mo Family has to evacuate.

64
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,280
Evacuate?

65
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,419
But if we evacuate, I won't have any of the medicines or materials.

66
00:05:05,419 --> 00:05:07,459
It'll be hard and take longer for me to make the antidote.

67
00:05:07,459 --> 00:05:10,120
The Mo family doesn't have the Pneuma of Strength.

68
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,970
You can't defeat the Mountain and Sea Gang.

69
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:15,010
Which is more important?

70
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:16,860
The antidote? Or life?

71
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,960
This… This…

72
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:24,499
Ever since I was a child, you've been good at medicine. But you never went out to treat or save people.

73
00:05:24,499 --> 00:05:28,539
You would rather stay here and make medicine, always fearful of getting into trouble.

74
00:05:28,539 --> 00:05:32,660
In this lifetime, don't you want to be a hero and do something important?

75
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:54,650
Mo Lin, that brat, always wanted me to be a hero.

76
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,970
At such a time, how can I run away?

77
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:13,380
The Mountain and Sea Gang must have used poisonous snakes as a way to preserve and nourish Lu Ping's blood.

78
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,370
Then they would mix it with Xi Sui powder...

79
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,790
Everyone,

80
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:23,519
Carefree Valley has always been a home for physicians and healers.

81
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,190
We've never interfered with world affairs.

82
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:29,319
But we can't stay away from the world anymore.

83
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:34,779
With the devil making trouble, we healers cannot retreat anymore.

84
00:06:34,779 --> 00:06:38,340
However, it will be a tough and dangerous battle.

85
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:42,759
The remaining Mo Family descendants are doomed to lose.

86
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:46,160
So, I will stay.

87
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,830
Please, everyone, evacuate first.

88
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:52,639
We won't go.

89
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,499
One more person means that much is more power.

90
00:06:54,499 --> 00:06:56,439
I'm willing to stay.

91
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:02,359
I would rest in peace if I can help you create the antidote against the Force Eaters.

92
00:07:02,359 --> 00:07:03,679
- Yes. Yes.
- Yes! Let us stay.

93
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,980
I would like to stay.

94
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,039
Let us stay, Master.

95
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,559
Let us stay!

96
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,199
People in Carefree Valley have lived in seclusion for generations.

97
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,519
But bravery runs through all of them.

98
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,599
- Let us stay!
- That's right!

99
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,399
- Yes. Let us stay.
- We won't go.

100
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:17,530
- Let us stay. We won't go.
- Yes.

101
00:07:18,019 --> 00:07:19,890
Thank you, everyone.

102
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:23,630
Thank you very much.

103
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,379
Master, the men followed Chu Min up to here.

104
00:07:36,379 --> 00:07:39,890
Carefree Valley is up ahead.

105
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,350
Carefree Valley.

106
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,350
There is no such thing in the world.

107
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,630
Send them to hell.

108
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,850
It still won't work.

109
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:48,530
I need more time.

110
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,779
Master, there are too many people from the Mountain and Sea Gang. The poison mist can't defeat them.

111
00:08:55,779 --> 00:09:00,139
Young Madam and Elder Chu Min have taken all the young men to engage them.

112
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:02,359
She asked me to tell you to not be impatient.

113
00:09:02,359 --> 00:09:05,840
She'll definitely delay them until the very last second.

114
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,540
I got it.

115
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:25,359
Chu Min, I have imposed too much Pneuma of Essence on you.

116
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,559
You were also bitten by the snake.

117
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,450
This is already the end of the battle.

118
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,479
The demise of Carefree Valley is a foregone conclusion.

119
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,679
If you come back right now, I can still protect you.

120
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,580
Master.

121
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,639
Needless words.

122
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,930
If you want to fight, let's fight.

123
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,859
Attack Carefree Valley. Kill them all.

124
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,380
Master.

125
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,600
Master!

126
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,500
Follow me.

127
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,530
Master, it is poisonous.

128
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,170
Take the medicine first.

129
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,540
You both behave and stay here.

130
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:19,930
Master, where are you going?

131
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:24,319
The gang has invaded. You will be killed if you go back.

132
00:11:24,319 --> 00:11:28,819
I've only finished half of the antidote. As a healer, I can't just leave it there.

133
00:11:28,819 --> 00:11:31,989
Count me in if you're going to fight. I am a member of the Mo Family, too.

134
00:11:31,989 --> 00:11:35,510
If you go, who will take care of your master.

135
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,719
Old man, you dare look down on me? I can go with—

136
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,959
I added a sedative to the medicine.

137
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:50,390
When you wake up, everything will have passed.

138
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:56,660
Young Madam Mo, next time you see me, you'd better call me father.

139
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,700
Master!

140
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,060
Master.

141
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:13,550
Finally, it's having an effect.

142
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:18,090
Give me a bit more time. Give me a bit more time.

143
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,500
Attack!

144
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,959
Master, the trap inside Carefree Valley has been started.

145
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,800
If Carefree Valley is here, we'll be here.

146
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:49,820
If there's no Carefree Valley, we'll take some of you to be buried with us!

147
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,070
Little Mo.

148
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,550
Go Little Mo.

149
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:23,010
This time it's my turn to be a hero!

150
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,740
Retreat.

151
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:45,619
Master, Mo Buliu has died.

152
00:15:45,619 --> 00:15:50,020
But all the Force Eaters were taken down by the Mo Family.

153
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,950
Not a single one survived.

154
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,950
What about Chu Min?

155
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:10,470
I found a female body, but her face was already destroyed.

156
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:15,379
She has a similar physique to Chu Min. There is a wound left by a snake on her wrist.

157
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:24,870
She would rather die than surrender. True to one from Big Dipper.

158
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:28,680
Chu Min, I'll show you!

159
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:33,630
Because of your death, how much blood I'll shed in this world!

160
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:36,430
To repay the heavens for being unfair to me.

161
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,820
Pass on my orders.

162
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,610
Turn all the test subjects in the gang into Force Eaters.

163
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:52,130
And send them to Jin.

164
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:54,590
Full attack.

165
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,720
Master.

166
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,679
Father! Father!

167
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:47,180
Master Chu Min. Master Chu Min, wake up.

168
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,090
Master Chu Min.

169
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,740
Little Mo.

170
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:08,450
Master.

171
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,000
Master!

172
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:20,170
♫ Watch the little boat churning, laughing at the ordinariness ♫

173
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:24,360
Master. Father!

00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:28,040
Father! Father.

175
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,890
♫ The more spotlight, the more vivid the story ♫

176
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:38,700
♫ Laughing like the moon, ♫

177
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:43,250
♫ regretting the lighthouse broke in the waves, ♫

178
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:50,590
♫ I call the Milky Way that isolates us all, blue ♫

179
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,579
Su Tang, I almost figured out the antidote.

180
00:19:57,579 --> 00:20:00,079
I also arranged for someone to take Chu Min's place.

181
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,759
If Liu Song thinks Chu Min is dead, he should retreat.

182
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:07,390
The rest is up to you.

183
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:17,140
♫ Hide the reluctance between words ♫

185
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:28,590
Father. I will take Master Chu Min to help Eldest Senior on the front lines.

186
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:31,190
Don't worry.

187
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:33,010
Your devotion,

188
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,650
I will take it with me there.

189
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:49,100

192
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:06,180
[Jin City]

193
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,920
Whoa.

194
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:03,180
I welcome Your Majesty with the army of Jin.

195
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,810
How is the battle going in Jin?

196
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:09,539
The Dan army is still waiting. We defeated several of their strikes.

197
00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:11,670
Everything is under control.

198
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:19,140
Yan Xifan, I ordered you to find Lu Ping.

199
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:22,020
You failed and disobeyed an order and came here.

200
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,870
But this time you've contributed to protecting Jin.

201
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:32,780
Then, what do you think?

202
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:38,750
Should I be rewarding you? Or punishing you?

203
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:42,060
I know I am guilty. After the war,

204
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,860
I am willing to accept punishment without a word.

205
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:48,960
Forget it. Right now, I have need of you.

206
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,300
Wen Rui!

207
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,500
I'm here.

208
00:22:55,500 --> 00:23:00,230
I now bestow upon Yan Xifan the command of the Agile Dragon Army.

209
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:05,810
You and Yan Xifan should lead the army together to protect Shuo.

210
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:08,410
We thank His Majesty for his favor.

211
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:13,519
General Yan is loyal to Shuo. I am willing to assist him

212
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:15,750
to protect the country of Shuo.

213
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,079
He's a Force Eater! Protect His Majesty!

214
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,470
Who's the one who saved me?

215
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,410
Su Tang, why are you here?

216
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:53,179
Master Chu Min is in the cart over there. She isn't well. Please find someone to take care of her.

217
00:23:53,179 --> 00:23:57,039
I'm here because I have something important to tell you. Jin is in danger.

218
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:02,719
Where did Miss Su Tang get your news? We haven't seen any movement against Jin in days.

219
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:11,999
Go! Go!

220
00:24:11,999 --> 00:24:13,710
Whoa!

221
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,700
Greetings, Your Majesty.

222
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,999
Aren't you the general of Jin? What's wrong?

223
00:24:20,999 --> 00:24:23,660
Last night some people in black snuck into the city.

224
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:28,139
They were so skilled that nobody could defeat them. Jin has been lost, I beg Your Majesty for reinforcements.

225
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,559
We lost Jin? Why are you still alive then?!

226
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:44,250
We lost Jin in just one night.

227
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:50,630
So... this carefully arranged garrison, is just that vulnerable?!

228
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:54,840
Tell me. What use are you?!

229
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:02,719
Your Majesty, they are Force Eaters who can use six pneumas.

230
00:25:02,719 --> 00:25:06,469
Forget ordinary soldiers, even skilled martial artists can't defeat them.

231
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,820
The City of Jin is very important to the central plains.

232
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:15,250
If we lose it, Dan can invade us easily.

233
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:17,630
The consequences will be unthinkable.

234
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:22,940
Xifan, it was you who got soft hearted and let Lu Ping go.

235
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:25,810
I don't care how you do it,

236
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,430
you have to get Jin back.

237
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:33,899
I know I am guilty. I pledge on my life that I will get Jin back.

238
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,590
How is Master Chu Min?

239
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:02,900
Her wounds are pretty much recovered, but she still hasn't woken up yet.

240
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:11,620
Su Tang, why are you with Master Chu Min?

241
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:14,599
And just now. The powder you used to defeat the Force Eaters...

242
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:21,890
Master Chu Min risked her life

243
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:25,850
to steal the Xi Sui Powder and my brother's blood from the Mountain and Sea Gang.

244
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:31,170
She rushed to Carefree Valley. Father researched day and night.

245
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:35,810
When he was about to succeed, Liu Song showed up.

246
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:42,370
All the people in the valley died to protect me and Master Chu Min.

247
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,990
They fought each other until their deaths.

248
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,500
Su Tang,

249
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:56,190
I'm the one who implicated Carefree Valley. I am sorry.

250
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,960
Senior Brother,

251
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:09,350
whatever you say can't bring back Mo Lin or my father.

252
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,290
If you still feel ashamed,

253
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,710
you should destroy the Mountain and Sea Gang.

254
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:26,010
It could be considered avenging the hundreds of dead souls in Carefree Valley.

255
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,590
This was the antidote my father created.

256
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:38,410
It can temporarily weaken the power of the Force Eaters.

257
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:41,370
Maybe it can help you.

258
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,700
Su Tang, I promise you.

259
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,910
I will completely destroy the Mountain and Sea Gang.

260
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,589
- Master.
- Master Chu Min.

261
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,750
Who are you?

262
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:20,509
Master, I'm Su Tang.

263
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,260
What's wrong?

264
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,530
She was bitten by the blood snakes.

265
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:34,250
Liu Song also imposed the Pneuma of Essence on her repeatedly.

266
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,600
She may have lost her memory.

267
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,140
Then, what do we do?

268
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,400
Senior Brother, since Master has woken up.

269
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,110
I'll take her and go.

270
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,700
Where are you going?

271
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,990
Right now, I'm afraid only one person can save us.

272
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,590
I'm going to go find him.

273
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,250
You mean Lu Ping?

274
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,720
You are awake?

275
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,680
You woke up at just the right time.

276
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:18,630
This is when the sunshine is the warmest. Flowers bloom better.

277
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:21,139
Smell them. Don't they smell good?

278
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:29,200
What's wrong? Still groggy from sleeping?

279
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,430
Where… Where am I?

280
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:36,240
In a small village under Big Dipper.

281
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,590
During the peace talks in E'zhou, my brother and I passed by here.

282
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:44,700
I saw it was beautiful here, there were so many flowers.

283
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:49,560
I knew how you'd always talk about going home to plant flowers.

284
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:53,680
That was when I decided that if I had the chance, I'd bring you here.

285
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,479
How is it? Do you like it?

286
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,980
Yes.

287
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,680
I like it very much.

288
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:11,940
Do you like the flowers here or the person here?

289
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,250
Of course, I like the person more.

290
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,630
I like you, too.

291
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,910
My food is still cooking!

292
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:32,950
You know how to cook, too?

293
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,950
Burned it again.

294
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:47,080
Miss Qin, you don't have any luck with cooking.

295
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,940
This is the third time I've failed already.

296
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:53,720
If I fail this time, we won't have any rice left.

297
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:57,280
It doesn't matter. We can eat this.

298
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:00,440
Do you hate what I cooked that much?

299
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,140
Silly girl.

300
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,890
I don't have much longer to hate you.

301
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,840
I can't be saved.

302
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,560
Isn't that right?

303
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:25,919
That's right, there's no way to save you.

304
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:27,680
But instead of waiting for death sadly…

305
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,210
...why not live happily for the rest of these days.

306
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,890
I'll cook tomorrow.

307
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,830
How about marrying me tonight?

308
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:47,170
Rather than trying so hard to be a hero,

309
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,750
- I'd much rather be—
- ...an ordinary couple for one day.

310
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,980
I agree.

311
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,510
Fortunately you understand me.

312
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:11,710
The heavens witness.

313
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:14,330
The moon knows the heart.

314
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:18,860
Today, I, Lu Ping, am fortunate to have Qin Sang as my wife.

315
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,780
I don't wish to be with her until we're old.

316
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:24,560
I only ask for one morning and one night.

317
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,260
The earth is a witness.

318
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:28,360
The flowers understand our hopes.

319
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:31,740
Today, I, Qin Sang, am fortunate to have Lu Ping as my husband.

320
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:35,520
I don't envy immortal couples. I just want to be together.

Qin Sang,

337
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:22,100
did you hear something?

338
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,760
It is too quiet here.

339
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:34,100
Other than the sounds of our hearts beating, I don't hear anything else.

340
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:38,930
Being able to hear our heart beats,

341
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:43,670
proves that we're still alive.

342
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:48,330
Do you know, Qin Sang?

343
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:58,290
All this time, it's been so hard coping with the hardships fate brought into my life.

344
00:37:58,290 --> 00:38:00,890
I always felt like I had to keep on living.

345
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:04,990
But I never had the time to consider

346
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:10,190
why I wanted to keep on living.

347
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,510
Do you understand now?

348
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,940
Maybe it was just for this moment.

349
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,720
Tranquil.

350
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:26,220
Happy.

351
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:29,830
Having someone by my side.

352
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,160
It makes the whole world seem so innocent.

353
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,630
No grievances,

354
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:40,150
no worldly disputes.

355
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,700
Maybe in the end,

356
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:48,350
I did it to live through this one moment.

Master, do we really plan to give up on Lu Ping?

368
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,660
If he dies,

369
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:00,550
Sang Sang will pretty much die, too.

370
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,400
I really can't bear to watch anymore.

371
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:07,739
They were married today, but fate will separate them tomorrow.

372
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:11,110
The heavens are too cruel.

373
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:15,270
Everyone has their own fate.

374
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:19,930
If they can't deal with their own hardships,

375
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,890
what can others do?

Lu Ping can only wait for his death.

378
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,560
Not necessarily.

379
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:41,019
Su Tang? Why are you here?

380
00:40:41,019 --> 00:40:45,240
I escorted Master Chu Min to Big Dipper. I heard from Master that my brother and Qin Sang were here.

381
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:48,240
Elder Guo, I have a way to save my brother.

382
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,700
I went back to Big Dipper to get you medicine. Be good, stay home and wait for me.

383
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:23,039
Don't forget you said you were going to cook today.

384
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,389
I look forward to trying it. From Qin Sang.

385
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:46,210
Looks like I won't be able to make food.

386
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:50,070
It might be better to go to the market and buy some food for her.

387
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:52,950
Otherwise, she'll laugh at me.

388
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,739
Boss, two bowls of porridge to go.

389
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:12,220
Did you hear that war has started in the north?

390
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:16,759
The emperor bestowed on the Hero Yan a sword to fight against the Mountain and Sea Gang.

391
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:19,660
Young Master Yan is really a hero.

392
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:25,760
With his call, in just one day, about a thousand skilled people enrolled in the army.

393
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,760
War in the north. Who knows whether it'll come and affect us again?

394
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,280
It had just finally got peaceful.

395
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,479
Isn't this all to blame on that madman Lu Ping?

396
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,020
I heard he was the one who killed Yan Qiuci, the master of the martial arts circles,

397
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:39,060
so that the Mountain and Sea Gang could find their chance.

398
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:41,020
You can't say it like that.

399
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:45,130
At that time in E'zhou, Young Master Lu stopped

400
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:49,060
the war by himself. He can be called a hero.

401
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:54,950
But what he did later can't be compared to Young Master Yan.

402
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:02,079
Sorry for the wait sir, your porridge is ready.

403
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:06,139
Young Master Lu, it's you?

404
00:43:06,139 --> 00:43:08,659
it's me, Bao Niang. Don't you remember?

405
00:43:08,659 --> 00:43:09,940
You've mistaken me for someone else.

406
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:14,120
You'd saved my life before, how could I mistake you?

407
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:16,520
You're definitely mistaken.

408
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,930
Hey! Young Master Lu, your porridge.
