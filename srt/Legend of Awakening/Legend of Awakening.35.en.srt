00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,840
♫ The dark green sea is hazy ♫

3
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,750
♫ dissipating in a flash ♫

4
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:36,570
♫ Rivers and lakes divide the world ♫

5
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,950
♫ Ten thousands arrows are firing at once ♫

6
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:43,990
♫ Who has time to worry? Who loves the color of blood? ♫

7
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:47,780
♫ At that time, spirits are high ♫

8
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:51,660
♫ Who calls the world his home?
Who dares let his horse freely run? ♫

9
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,380
♫ Silently, tears form in the death of night ♫

10
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:58,200
♫ Heroes are cutting all ties, ♫

11
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,060
♫ giving up whether it's life or death, ♫

12
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,230
♫ never asking what the cost is ♫

13
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:09,840
♫ Good and evil must be distinguished ♫

14
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,760
♫ The wind blows off the snow ♫

15
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,640
♫ On the body, etch multiple scars, ♫

16
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,750
♫ wandering all over the world, ♫

17
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:25,200
♫ only wish to ask for answers from this world ♫

18
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,200
♫ A teenager doesn't have to be a hero ♫

19
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,120
♫ There is no need for flowers in the dream ♫

20
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,260
♫ Destiny need not be afraid ♫

21
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:40,760
♫ Because you have him all the way, ♫

22
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:44,730
♫ experienced a handful of conquests, ♫

23
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:48,540
♫ overcame a number of challenges ♫

24
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,730
♫ From now on, happy and free! ♫

25
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:56,440
♫ The only wish is, with the world, ♫

26
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:00,640

00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,600
[Episode 35]

29
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,200
This is Old White.

30
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,460
He's also a poor guy imprisoned here.

31
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,680
- Unfortunately, he is insane.
- Snowy weed.

32
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,780
This drug... is not fatal.

33
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:41,800
The weed would be given to those who know the secret in the army.

34
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,679
They will lose their mind if taken over a long period of time.

35
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:49,171
They will forget their past and even forget who they are.

36
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,280
If I am right,

37
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,011
he is Lu Chenfeng.

38
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,560
What did you say?

39
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,260
He is Lu Chenfeng, Tianquan's Peak Master.

40
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,580
He is also the reason why I came to Wuji Manor.

41
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,431
How about Lu Ping and Qin Sang?

42
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,460
Don't worry.

43
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:34,140
I've settled them at the same place as your Uncle Lu.

44
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,031
They're safe.

45
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,760
I hope you can understand that

46
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,780
it's necessary for me to do that.

47
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,740
Father,

48
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,291
this is my fault.

49
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,700
I wronged you. I am sorry.

50
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,679
Now we've gotten the Thousand Pine Ruler back.

51
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,999
The Mountain and Sea Gang will surely come for it.

52
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,360
We must be more cautious in the future.

53
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,140
I am handing over the care of Wuji Manor

54
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,491
and the entire pugilist world to you.

55
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,591
I understand.

56
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:18,240
Go with your brothers and take the Thousand Pine Ruler to Wuji Manor.

57
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,120
Keep it under close supervision.

58
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:24,039
I will take care of the rest.

59
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,340
Yes.

60
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,391
No wonder he called me "Older Brother."

61
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,051
He was probably calling my father.

62
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,940
Lu Ping.

63
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,291
We met an old friend by chance.

64
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,451
Isn't that good?

65
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,820
It's just a pity that he doesn't remember anything.

66
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,371
Otherwise, I could ask

67
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,171
what my father looked like

68
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,851
and what my mother looked like.

69
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,640
You don't have parents,

70
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,651
but you still have me.

71
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,291
I will definitely find a way out

72
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,291
just because of your words.

73
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,691
We'll bring Old White with us.

74
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,560
This drug was for him.

75
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,800
Someone has a secret and doesn't want him to remember it.

76
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,260
What do you mean?

77
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:07,911
There's something that I think you must know.

78
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,280
Wen Rui had fought against the attackers before.

79
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,920
It doesn't seem like he's from the Mountain and Sea Gang,

80
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,151
but from Wuji Manor.

81
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,020
Recently, Master Yan has done a lot secretly behind our backs.

82
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:23,560
It seems that he was purposely trying to stop the Agile Dragon Army from eliminating the Mountain and Sea Gang.

83
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,960
- I even suspect that—
- It can't be.

84
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,920
Uncle Yan is a good friend of my father's. He also despises Liu Song.

85
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,660
He was injured last time trying to help the Big Dipper with their problems.

86
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:35,711
He does his best to protect me and the Big Dipper.

87
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,960
If you say he's colluding with the Mountain and Sea Gang, I absolutely don't believe it.

88
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,480
I don't get it either.

89
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,720
If he really did,

90
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,851
what's his purpose?

91
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,911
If Old White could wake up, that'd be great.

92
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,720
You shared some of his meal.

93
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,280
The effects of the drugs should have been weakened by now.

94
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,520
Let's ask him if there are any clues.

95
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,960
Maybe we can get out of here and find out who the mastermind is.

96
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,660
How should we ask him?

97
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,471
Let's stimulate him.

98
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:24,620
Qin Sang, he is just a pitiful person.

99
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,200
Move.

100
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,379
Who exactly are you? Speak.

101
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,831
It's you.

102
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,200
It's you.

103
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,071
It's you.

104
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,951
We've found a way out.

105
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,120
Old White is not crazy.

106
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,380
It's not a normal sword either.

107
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,131
It's a treasured sword.

108
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,820
With this sword,

109
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,911
I can find a way out.

110
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,260
Qin Sang,

111
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,540
do you know?

112
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,471
Actually, I'm the same as him.

113
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,660
I've been locked in a hellish place like this

114
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,731
for nearly ten years.

115
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,171
I almost forgot who I was before.

116
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:01,999
I thought I was the only one who the gods would bestow such a miserable fate.

117
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,280
I never thought someone else would suffer the same fate as me.

118
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,460
Old White,

119
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,680
you don't want to give up either, right?

120
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,931
So in order for us to survive,

121
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,051
we have to fight together.

122
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,391
Sister-in-Law.

123
00:10:23,391 --> 00:10:26,779
Who are you calling sister-in-law? Your sister-in-law is here.

124
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,311
Forge the sword.

125
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,600
Sister-in-Law.

126
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,760
What did you say?

127
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,051
This sword was forged for your sister-in-law?

128
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,060
You…

129
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,831
Your sister-in-law is my mother.

130
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,700
Sister-in-Law. Return!

131
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,439
No one is allowed to go near the master's study these next few days, understand?

132
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:15,331
Yes, Young Master.

133
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:23,579
Hero Xifan, have you seen the princess?

134
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,700
What happened to her?

135
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:30,359
She has been looking for Lu Ping since last night and hasn't been back all night. So far,

136
00:11:30,359 --> 00:11:33,319
we can't find her anywhere. I am extremely worried about her.

137
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:40,031
Don't worry. I've arranged them to be in the same place as your Senior Lu.

138
00:11:40,031 --> 00:11:41,751
They're safe.

139
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,931
I had no choice but to do this.

140
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,591
She—

141
00:11:49,591 --> 00:11:52,399
Xifan, do you know something?

142
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,071
The princess went looking for Lu Ping every night.

143
00:11:56,071 --> 00:12:00,279
After all, she is young and cannot help thinking about romance.

144
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:04,891
I think... the attack was just an act they put on.

145
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:07,839
It's possible that they both eloped.

146
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,299
That's impossible. The princess is extremely righteous.

147
00:12:10,299 --> 00:12:11,730
The Mountain and Sea Gang has not been destroyed yet.

148
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:15,310
How could she ignore His Majesty's edict and the Qin Family's reputation?

149
00:12:16,299 --> 00:12:21,039
If she completes her mission and accomplishes what she wanted, will the result be different?

150
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:22,711
What do you mean by that?

151
00:12:22,711 --> 00:12:25,391
I have to inform you of some news.

152
00:12:25,391 --> 00:12:30,319
Wuji Manor has successfully retrieved the Thousand Pine Ruler as of the day before yesterday.

153
00:12:30,319 --> 00:12:35,151
You retrieved the Thousand Pine Ruler? Then, why didn't you tell us?

154
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:42,419
Princess is not in the mood to discuss serious matters. You are indulging her as well.

155
00:12:42,419 --> 00:12:47,379
Should I have still relied on the Agile Dragon Army? Matters of the pugilist world should be settled by the pugilist world.

156
00:12:47,379 --> 00:12:50,531
I could only solve this by myself.

157
00:12:50,531 --> 00:12:52,419
Young Hero Xifan, is this true?

158
00:12:52,419 --> 00:12:55,280
General Wen, a few days ago,

159
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:59,579
my father and I besieged a team from the Mountain and Sea Gang. We indeed retrieved the Thousand Pine Ruler.

160
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:01,211
What about Liu Song?

161
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,611
He escaped.

162
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:10,231
However, we've solved the problem of the commander's seal.

163
00:13:10,231 --> 00:13:15,539
I have invited people from different martial arts circles to Wuji Manor for the wedding.

164
00:13:15,539 --> 00:13:18,991
This... wedding must be held.

165
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,220
Now the princess is missing.

166
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:29,959
If you send soldiers to look for her, then aren't you telling the world that the princess ran away from the marriage?

167
00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:32,951
Who will bear the guilt

168
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,711
of going against the edict and resisting the marriage in the Qin Family?

169
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,251
Please provide me with a solution.

170
00:13:43,251 --> 00:13:46,471
I have a method that will satisfy both sides.

171
00:13:46,471 --> 00:13:50,999
The marriage can be held as planned. The Qin Family can keep their reputation.

172
00:13:50,999 --> 00:13:55,591
The plan to exterminate the Mountain and Sea Gang remains the same.

173
00:13:55,591 --> 00:13:57,480
The marriage will be held as planned?

174
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,099
The princess is missing. How are we going to hold this wedding?

175
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:04,971
Don't we still have an old friend of the Qin Family at Wuji Manor?

176
00:14:04,971 --> 00:14:08,400
Father, do you mean Ziyan?

177
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,779
No. Ling Ziyan is a servant of the Qin Family. How could she—

178
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:17,399
General Wen, I will help you send people to look for the princess.

179
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:21,379
However, we still have to take care of serious matters. Think it over carefully.

180
00:14:21,379 --> 00:14:25,479
Are you part of the Qin Family or a soldier of the emperor?

181
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:36,040
Father, do we really have to deceive General Wen like this?

182
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,479
Don't say anymore. Matters of the pugilist world should be settled by the pugilist world.

183
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:44,059
There are too many rules in Agile Dragon Army. I am annoyed about them.

184
00:14:44,059 --> 00:14:47,499
Moreover, haven't you always wanted to protect your brother?

185
00:14:47,499 --> 00:14:52,439
After this matter is settled, Lu Ping and Qin Sang can run away together to a faraway place.

186
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:59,131
As for the matter of having Ziyan marry in the place of the princess, I will report this matter to His Majesty myself.

187
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,020
Father, can I go see them?

188
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:07,540
No. We must eliminate the Mountain and Sea Gang once and for all.

189
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:10,711
Wen Rui believes in our words for now.

190
00:15:10,711 --> 00:15:13,771
Don't cause trouble and make him suspicious.

191
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:22,219
Fan'er, you can't hesitate when trying to do something important.

192
00:15:22,219 --> 00:15:24,811
We have found the Thousand Pine Ruler.

193
00:15:24,811 --> 00:15:28,960
This marriage... treat it like Dad is fulfilling your desire.

194
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,751
Everything will be as you wish.

195
00:15:31,751 --> 00:15:35,071
You just need to go with the flow.

196
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,080
Yes.

197
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,211
Young Manor Master!

198
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:52,699
Young Manor Master, Miss Ling is here. She said she's here to prepare the wedding clothes for you.

199
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,160
I see.

200
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:27,820
Ziyan, my father's decision was abrupt.

201
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,591
I am sorry about this.

202
00:16:29,591 --> 00:16:32,271
I begged Manor Master for this marriage.

203
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,299
Manor Master, I am willing to marry on behalf of Miss.

204
00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:40,239
I am willing to cooperate with you to complete the arrangement of His Majesty. Don't worry.

205
00:16:40,239 --> 00:16:45,519
I grew up with Miss. I am very familiar with her actions and demeanor. There will be no flaws.

206
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,951
You have no relationship with Wuji Manor.

207
00:16:48,951 --> 00:16:51,671
Why are you willing to sacrifice your reputation?

208
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,091
Young Master saved my life.

209
00:16:55,091 --> 00:16:59,559
I am willing to share his worries and serve him all my life.

210
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,900
I hope you can fulfill my wish.

211
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,851
Xifan asked me multiple times to take you in.

212
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:12,331
This shows the importance you hold in his heart.

213
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:16,291
Since that's the case, then it's settled.

214
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,691
Thank you.

215
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,771
Why are you doing this?

216
00:17:23,771 --> 00:17:27,519
I am a nobody. I've also received a great favor from Wuji Manor.

217
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:31,319
This marriage also affects the fate of Wuji Manor and your future.

218
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:35,199
I'll do what Miss can't do and doesn't want to do for her.

219
00:17:35,199 --> 00:17:37,751
Ziyan, you don't have to force yourself.

220
00:17:37,751 --> 00:17:40,859
I'm not forcing myself. I'm willing to.

221
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:41,800
Ziyan.

222
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:47,091
I want to marry Yan Xifan. Others may think it's an act.

223
00:17:47,091 --> 00:17:49,851
You and I know clearly.

224
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,360
Xifan,

225
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,070
you don't want to marry me?

226
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,850
In this world, there is only one person whom

227
00:18:08,491 --> 00:18:12,571
I would like to get married with and live with.

228
00:18:12,571 --> 00:18:14,350
This person...

229
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,130
is you.

230
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,059
General.

231
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:34,080
You still haven't found her yet?

232
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,280
No.

233
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,639
Go check again over there.

234
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,840
Yes.

235
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,020
You, follow me.

236
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:54,380
Lu Ping, are we going to get out soon?

237
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:57,351
Are you in such a hurry to go out and get married?

238
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,751
I remember when you and I first met.

239
00:19:01,751 --> 00:19:06,731
You kept hiding your identity from me. You didn't want to tell me.

240
00:19:06,731 --> 00:19:10,579
It caused me to mistake you for being a member of the Mountain and Sea Gang.

241
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,811
Are you still blaming me?

242
00:19:15,811 --> 00:19:18,011
I understand now.

243
00:19:18,011 --> 00:19:22,911
You always kept it a secret because you didn't want me to get involved and get into trouble.

244
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,931
Why are you talking about this?

245
00:19:26,931 --> 00:19:31,731
I was so cruel to you at that time because I wanted to protect you.

246
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,000
You grew up from much suffering, yet you are still so tenacious.

247
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,179
I come from a noble family, but I can do nothing for you.

248
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:45,291
I will lose the Qin Family's reputation.

249
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:49,579
I am a man. How can I have a girl protecting me?

250
00:19:49,579 --> 00:19:51,631
Isn't that even more humiliating?

251
00:19:54,760 --> 00:20:00,360
Lu Ping, if this time Yan Qiuci's really has bad intentions,

252
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,111
what are you going to do?

253
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,891
I will ask him personally.

254
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,751
I will accompany you.

255
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:20,731
Those heroic words Miss Qin said before,

256
00:20:20,731 --> 00:20:23,991
still can't withstand my masculinity.

257
00:20:23,991 --> 00:20:28,400
You brat. I hate people who don't say what they mean the most in my life.

258
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,179
I've been sitting for too long. It's uncomfortable.

259
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,239
Elder Brother, it's done.

260
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:14,760
Done?

261
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:26,971
Good, Old White. You're good.

262
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,460
We haven't put the first edge on it.

263
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:35,619
There's no time. We need to get out of here first.

264
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,839
Lu Ping. Miss Qin.

265
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:46,591
We are facing the Mountain and Sea Gang right now.

266
00:21:46,591 --> 00:21:50,231
For Wuji Manor and Shuo State,

267
00:21:50,231 --> 00:21:53,931
the truth can only be hidden along with Junior Lu.

268
00:21:53,931 --> 00:21:57,999
Everyone will think that you two are a couple living a sequestered life.

269
00:21:57,999 --> 00:22:00,771
They won't search for you anymore.

270
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:08,391
Liu Song, I won't let you escape from me again this time.

271
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,231
We've almost succeeded.

272
00:22:18,231 --> 00:22:19,540
Go on.

273
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,971
What's wrong?

274
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,280
Hurt.

275
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,371
I have a headache.

276
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:55,339
This is bad. It's toxic smoke.

277
00:22:55,339 --> 00:22:59,751
Someone wants to kill us. We have to hurry out of here.

278
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:27,219
Old White, hurry and run. Let's go.

279
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,419
- Qin Sang.
- Elder Brother.

280
00:23:35,419 --> 00:23:37,639
Let's go. Hurry. Let's go.

281
00:23:37,639 --> 00:23:40,279
Old White, you're a good person.

282
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:44,351
You should know that I can't leave my wife behind.

283
00:23:44,351 --> 00:23:47,939
If we can't get out, you should live your life well. Do you hear me?

284
00:23:47,939 --> 00:23:50,519
Go. Go.

285
00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:00,080
Qin Sang, can you hear me?

286
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,839
Silly, why did you come back?

287
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:06,440
Qin Sang, I always say you're a fool,

288
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,131
but I am the biggest fool myself.

289
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:21,740
No. The four pneumas are not enough.

290
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:26,399
I need to break another lock. If I can break another, then I can save you.

291
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:36,839
Lu Ping, don't do that anymore. You'll die.

292
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,691
I don't believe I can't save you.

293
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,359
Lu Ping. Lu Ping.

294
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,080
Lu Ping.

295
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,570
Chenfeng,

296
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:19,180
forge a sword for my wife.

297
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:22,839
Weapons are divided into Yin and Yang. Yin and Yang coexist.

298
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:24,700
They will never be separated.

299
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,340
Okay.

300
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:32,179
I will forge it will cold iron, and finish the edge with blood. It will definitely be a good sword.

301
00:26:32,179 --> 00:26:36,079
Elder Brother, what do you want to name this sword?

302
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:44,260
Wifey, do you have a good name for it?

303
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:52,431
Let's call it... Dream.

304
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,171
D-Dream.

305
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:02,060
Finish the edge with blood. Finish the edge with blood.

306
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:06,779
You need to finish the edge with blood. Finish the edge with blood! Finish the edge with blood!

307
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:11,519
Elder Brother, I remember! You need to finish the edge of the sword with blood.

308
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:16,660
Yes. Dream. We still have Dream.

309
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,240
Qin Sang!

310
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:41,191
Is it because of the toxic smoke or because she bled too much?

311
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,871
Qin Sang! Qin Sang.

312
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:58,191
It's the Cold toxin. Cold toxin in her body.

313
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,039
Is there something wrong with your sword? Did you poison it?!

314
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:04,419
No. No.

315
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,551
It's the cold iron from the bottom of the lake.

316
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:18,239
I need to find Wen Rui. He should have a way. Old White!

317
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,991
Why are you staring blankly?

318
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,080
Father.

319
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:12,019
I've sent invitations. Uncles from all sects are here.

320
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:16,299
This a big opportunity. I will introduce them to you later.

321
00:30:16,299 --> 00:30:20,180
Father, when will we eliminate the Mountain and Sea Gang?

322
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:27,111
We eat one bite at a time. We do things one step at a time.

323
00:30:27,111 --> 00:30:32,399
Eliminating the Mountain and Sea Gang will be the first big thing you do in the pugilist world.

324
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:37,031
Then, can I meet Lu Ping after I've accomplished that?

325
00:30:37,031 --> 00:30:42,259
It is your wedding today. You are marrying the girl you love.

326
00:30:42,259 --> 00:30:43,831
Cheer up.

327
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:59,451
If you can't find her, then keep looking! If she's alive, I want to see her. If she's dead, I want to see her corpse!

328
00:30:59,451 --> 00:31:01,559
- Yes!
- Wen Rui.

329
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,571
Princess!

330
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,651
Hurry and find a doctor.

331
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,020
Look at what you did to the princess.

332
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:28,551
You couldn't protect her with an army.

333
00:31:28,551 --> 00:31:30,431
How about you?

334
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:38,579
General, Princess has cold toxin in her body. This—

335
00:31:38,579 --> 00:31:42,539
Hurry and make some ginger soup. Then get a fire to warm up the princess.

336
00:31:42,539 --> 00:31:45,019
Yes. I am on it.

337
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,300
Lu Ping. Lu Ping.

338
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:57,660
I am here. Do you feel better?

339
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,531
Where am I?

340
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:04,599
Princess, you're in the mansion at Wuji Manor.

341
00:32:04,599 --> 00:32:08,271
It's my fault that you got hurt.

342
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,091
Yes. It is your fault.

343
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:21,100
A question for you. We went to Wuji Manor just now. Why is there red everywhere?

344
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,380
What's going on?

345
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:26,099
Master Yan insists on the wedding despite the disappearance of the princess.

346
00:32:26,099 --> 00:32:29,811
It's a marriage bestowed by His Majesty. There's nothing I can do.

347
00:32:29,811 --> 00:32:34,860
Wedding? Qin Sang wasn't here. Who will Xifan marry?

348
00:32:35,491 --> 00:32:37,571
What's wrong with Wuji Manor?

349
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,491
Wuji Manor.

350
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:52,060
Elder Brother! Sister-in-Law!

351
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,531
Wuji Manor.

352
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,171
W-Wuji Manor.

353
00:32:58,171 --> 00:33:02,239
Old White, what's wrong? What's wrong, Old White. Old White, what's wrong?

354
00:33:02,239 --> 00:33:05,149
Elder Brother. Sister-in-Law. I saw them again.

355
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:07,579
- Everything's okay.
- I saw them again.

356
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:11,299
Miss, who is he?

357
00:33:11,299 --> 00:33:13,591
He is Lu Chenfeng.

358
00:33:13,591 --> 00:33:15,091
Old White, don't be scared.

359
00:33:15,091 --> 00:33:16,319
- He is out of his mind.
- You're okay.

360
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,220
You're okay.

361
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:20,671
He only trusts Lu Ping. Don't disturb him.

362
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,640
Old White.

363
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,811
I remember.

364
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,231
What do you remember?

365
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:59,631
The reason why I have painstakingly stayed here for 19 years.

366
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:05,311
Elder Brother is here. You can tell me.

367
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:10,511
You're a liar! My elder brother is already dead.

368
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:18,809
Old White, do you remember?

369
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:23,560
I need you to kill him for me.

370
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,840
Kill my foe for me.

371
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,230
I want to avenge my elder brother!

372
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:30,770
Why don't you kill him by yourself?

373
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:32,820
Who is he?

374
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,880
I don't know martial arts.

375
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:40,520
My elder brother, sister-in-law, and other seniors and juniors,

376
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:43,880
they all know martial arts except for me.

377
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,040
I only know how to forge weapons.

378
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,270
I thought with my elder brother around,

379
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:51,120
he would be able to protect me my whole life.

380
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:55,919
Because of this, I couldn't protect him the day he was killed.

381
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,560
Even though I don't know who you are,

382
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,431
but I can only rely on you now.

383
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:04,600
What is his name?

384
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,500
He…

385
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,920
I don't know. I remembered just now.

386
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:22,560
I only know he is at Wuji Manor.

387
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:26,051
Wuji Manor. Wuji Manor.

388
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,851
Wuji Manor.

389
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,780
Come out with me. I have something to ask.

390
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,380
Why?

391
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,899
- Let go of me.
- Tell me the truth.

392
00:35:40,899 --> 00:35:45,580
What happened at Wuji Manor these past few days when Qin Sang and I were trapped?

393
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:49,979
Yan Qiuci has already gotten the Thousand Pine Ruler back from the Mountain and Sea Gang.

394
00:35:49,979 --> 00:35:53,279
Today's wedding is for Xifan and Ling Ziyan.

395
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,640
He used Qin's reputation

396
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:58,840
and frontier military defense as excuses.

397
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,640
I... couldn't stop him.

398
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:04,540
He is good to his own son.

399
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,880
How about the son of his friend?

400
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,040
To the son of his brother?

401
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,291
What do you mean by that? What are you going to do?

402
00:36:11,291 --> 00:36:13,460
What can I do?

403
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:15,831
We are old friends.

404
00:36:15,831 --> 00:36:17,560
We can talk about the past.

405
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,519
Master, wait for me. Master.

406
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:40,799
- What's wrong with you again?
- Master.

407
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:43,340
The Pneuma of Energy is for moving light on your feet.

408
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:45,300
It's for you to move quickly.

409
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:48,311
It's not for running forward day and night.

410
00:36:48,311 --> 00:36:51,800
We have been running for a whole day. Horses would die running like this.

411
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,380
I am the next to die from exhaustion.

412
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,039
I am afraid that my elder brother won't make it if we don't get there in time.

413
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:59,600
Master, why don't you carry me?

414
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,400
What did you say?!

415
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,280
Wait.

416
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,120
Master, the smell of Boss.

417
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,660
Something is wrong.

418
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,180
Old White.

419
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,131
I am taking him to Wuji Manor.

420
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:51,420
Lu Ping, it is Xifan's wedding.

421
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:56,020
Although Yan Qiuci is unpredictable,

422
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:59,680
he is determined to destroy the Mountain and Sea Gang.

423
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,420
In case someone is controlling Wuji Manor from behind

424
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:04,631
or there are secrets,

425
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:09,051
we have to wait until we find out the truth.

426
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,071
Don't be impulsive.

427
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,780
Don't worry.

428
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:21,780
Xifan's wedding... I know what to do.

429
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,339
I have come to an agreement with Wen Rui.

430
00:38:23,339 --> 00:38:27,680
He will attend the wedding tonight and bring Old White and me into the manor.

431
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:31,020
I'm just checking.

432
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:34,860
Whatever the outcome is, I will discuss it with you.

433
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:37,000
You should rest here.

434
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,900
Wait for me to return.

435
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,831
Take care of yourself.

436
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,151
Let's go, Old White.

437
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:14,070
[Wuji]

438
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,771
Master Liu. Nice to meet you.

439
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:28,130
Old White.

440
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,620
It is a big event today. You need to listen to me.

441
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:37,019
Yes, Elder Brother.

442
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,671
Why do you still call me "Elder Brother"?

443
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:46,840
Don't worry. Today, you only need to identify the enemy.

444
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,940
I will take care of the rest.

445
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,420
Manor Master Yan, congratulations!

446
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:06,239
Everyone, please have a seat.

447
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:15,480
I am indebted to everyone here, being the master of
the martial arts circle for years.

448
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,520
Recently, the Mountain and Sea Gang is causing trouble in the pugilist world.

449
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:22,491
I will have to fight against the gang with you.

450
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:27,880
Today, my son and Princess Xining are getting married on behalf of His Majesty's wishes.

451
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:32,740
After the wedding, they will work together with Wuji Manor and you

452
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:36,720
to eliminate the scum in the pugilist world

453
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,420
and maintain justice.

454
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:40,371
Great!

455
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:51,500
It's time. Please welcome the bride!

456

[Wuji]

457
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,680
You don't even wait for me to drink with you on your wedding day.

458
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,660
Do you remember our brotherhood?

459
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,880
Old White.

460
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,471
Look carefully. Is your enemy here?

461
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:13,719
The Yan Family is skilled in using the sword.

462
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:17,940
Today, I will pass on the family's treasure, this sword, to my son.

463
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:20,740
This means that I also pass on the Yan Family to Xifan.

464
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:26,480
I hope you all can take care of my son in the future.

465
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,580
Xifan, take this.

466
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,020
Thank you, Father.

467
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:43,471
Congratulations, Young Manor Master!

468
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:08,300
Old White, what's wrong?

469
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:10,800
The sword.

470
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:14,851
The man with the sword.

471
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:18,030
It's him.

472
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:19,791
He was the one who killed my elder brother.

♫ I smiled to the leaving person ♫

481
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:25,800
♫ The more spotlight, the more vivid the story ♫

482
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:30,730
♫ Laughing like the moon, ♫

483
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:35,260
♫ regretting the lighthouse broke in the waves, ♫

484
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:42,800
♫ I call the Milky Way that isolates us all, blue ♫

485
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:49,980
♫ Like a moat built under the sea, ♫

486
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:54,740
♫ waiting for the words on the paper boat to disappear, ♫

487
00:44:54,740 --> 00:45:02,270
♫ there must always be someone who doesn’t
remember listening to the other ♫

488
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:09,340
♫ Anyone who is correctly guessed will end in disfavor ♫

489
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:13,560
♫ You are particularly touched but others consider it ordinary ♫

490
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:18,840
♫ Like the author, roughly put down with a weak stroke, ♫

491
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:23,320
♫ the writing boat on the lake was just like
a paper crane in the air ♫

492
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:28,140
♫ Laughing like the moon, ♫

493
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:32,860
♫ regretting the lighthouse broke in the waves, ♫

494
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:41,070
♫ I call the Milky Way that isolates us all, blue ♫

495
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:47,790
♫ Can a moat be built on the seabed? ♫

496
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:52,100
♫ Wipe all the words on the paper boat! ♫

497
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:59,430
♫ Please let someone not remember and don't tell another! ♫

498
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:06,700
♫ Hide the reluctance between words ♫

499
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:11,240
♫ Unfortunately, I (you) am (are) an average author ♫

500
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:18,850
♫ No matter how you (I) describe the rest, it's unnecessary! ♫

501
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:29,730
♫ Don't describe my unfulfilled promise! ♫

502
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:38,510
♫ Don't interpret my hidden fire-smoke! ♫

503
00:46:38,510 --> 00:46:47,540
♫ Don't let the paper boat in the rough wave chasing me! ♫

504
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:56,200
♫ Don't wait until it's over to know there are you and me! ♫
