00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:28,950
♫ The dark green sea is hazy ♫

3
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:32,710
♫ dissipating in a flash ♫

4
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:36,700
♫ Rivers and lakes divide the world ♫

5
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,960
♫ Ten thousands arrows are firing at once ♫

6
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,960
♫ Who has time to worry? Who loves the color of blood? ♫

7
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,740
♫ At that time, spirits are high ♫

8
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:51,570
♫ Who calls the world his home?
Who dares let his horse freely run? ♫

9
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,400
♫ Silently, tears form in the death of night ♫

10
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,230
♫ Heroes are cutting all ties, ♫

11
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,040
♫ giving up whether it's life or death, ♫

12
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,220
♫ never asking what the cost is ♫

13
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:09,820
♫ Good and evil must be distinguished ♫

14
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,800
♫ The wind blows off the snow ♫

15
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,630
♫ On the body, etch multiple scars, ♫

16
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:19,720
♫ wandering all over the world, ♫

17
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:25,130
♫ only wish to ask for answers from this world ♫

18
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:29,220
♫ A teenager doesn't have to be a hero ♫

19
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,040
♫ There is no need for flowers in the dream ♫

20
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,150
♫ Destiny need not be afraid ♫

21
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:40,600
♫ Because you have him all the way, ♫

22

[Episode 36]

29
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,399
The Yan Family is famous for its sword techniques.

30
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,600
Today my son will inherit the Sword of Yan,

31
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,180
as well as Wuji Manor.

32
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,280
Congratulations, Young Master!

33
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,700
What's wrong Old White?

34
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,940
Sword.

35
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,040
The man with the sword.

36
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,760
It was him. He killed my brother.

37
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,460
Old White.

38
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:26,179
Father, who is that?

39
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,780
Lu Ping, how come it's you?

40
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,199
Kill him. Kill him. You promised me!

41
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:35,879
- Old White.
- Kill him.

42
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:39,860
Turns out it's you. You are the murderer from 19 years ago.

43
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:43,459
Murderer? Master Yan is a murderer? What is going on?

44
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:46,779
Lu Ping, what are you talking about? Who is he?

45
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,999
People from the Mountain and Sea Gang have snuck into the Agile Dragon Army. Get them.

46
00:03:53,999 --> 00:03:58,500
There will be enough time for that later. I, as the son of Leng Xiutan,

47
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,800
will get my justice from you.

48
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,659
- Go.
- Kill him!

49
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,199
A Ze, chase them.

50
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:11,070
[Wuji]

51
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:13,700
General Wen, what's going on?

52
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,560
Ask your respected father later yourself.

53
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:26,120
[Wuji Manor]

54
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,219
Master, we've already taken care of the guests.

55
00:04:31,219 --> 00:04:34,340
But Young Master said he would like to go out for a walk.

56
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:38,899
- What about Ling Ziyan?
- Miss Ling has been in her room this whole time, hasn't cried or made a fuss.

57
00:04:38,899 --> 00:04:41,380
She said she would wait for Young Master to return.

58
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,860
At least she's a sensible girl.

59
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,940
What about Young Master?

60
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:49,780
He is confused. He will be back. You may take your leave.

61
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,080
Yes.

62
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,820
Master, we have divided the disciples into a dozen or so teams of men and horses.

63
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:01,820
They've searched around Wuji Manor, but haven't found any signs of Lu Ping.

64
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:06,320
And County Master Xining seems to be back in camp.

65
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,160
She seems to have been hurt.

66
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,179
Continue the search. Send all our men

67
00:05:11,179 --> 00:05:14,420
and stop them from gossiping.

68
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:19,559
We should say it was the plot of Mountain and Sea Gang, that Lu Ping was lured here by Liu Song.

69
00:05:19,559 --> 00:05:21,460
This needs to be the only version of this story.

70
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,760
Yes.

71
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,720
Go on then.

72
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,920
Yes.

73
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,000
Come on out now.

74
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:58,160
As my son, you shouldn't be so depressed.

75
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,000
Father, don't you think that you owe me an explanation?

76
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,780
You've always had a reason

77
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:12,780
for everything you've done.

78
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,080
That year I left home,

79
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,260
you never sent anyone to come and find me.

80
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,760
I knew that you wanted me to grow up.

81
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:28,160
But I really don't understand what happened today.

82
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:34,919
You weren't actually detaining Lu Chenfeng for his own safety were you?

83
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,820
That's right.

84
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:41,920
What about Lu Ping and Qin Sang? Did you send someone to kill them, to silence them?

85
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:49,039
I should have killed them in person. Then today's troubles would've never happened.

86
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:54,180
The brother Lu Chengfeng said you killed,

87
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:58,539
was the master of Big Dipper, Leng Xiutan, right? Lu Ping's father?

88
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,400
Yes.

89
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,580
Father.

90
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:16,300
But you said his parents were killed by the Mountain and Sea Gang.

91
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:21,460
That's also correct. I'm the one that started the Mountain and Sea Gang.

92
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,860
I don't understand.

93
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,360
Since we've already discussed this much,

94
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,940
I might as well tell you everything.

95
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,050
More than ten years ago,

96
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:47,920
Wuji Manor didn't exist in Jianghu.

97
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:54,800
In Jianghu, only the seven masters of Big Dipper were the most famous.

98
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,500
Master Leng Xiutan was excellent at the Pneuma of Sound.

99
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,900
His wife Shao Yinchu was a hero.

100
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,960
She achieved perfection with the sword on her own.

101
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,180
I was ranked second through my abilities with the Sword of Yan technique.

102
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:25,040
The rest, Chu Min and Guo Youdao could use both the Pneuma of Strength and Air.

103
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:34,480
Liu Song was the last to join us.

104
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:38,739
He was noble, extravagant, and good at the Pneuma of Essence.

105
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:45,759
Chenfeng was the youngest. He had some mental health issues.

106
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:49,180
But he was a genius at the Pneuma of Energy.

107
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,200
He was an expert in creating weapons.

108
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,100
Brother Leng was kind and amiable.

109
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,880
He was deeply in love with his wife

110
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,600
and also took good care of us.

111
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:12,280
We seven were young and in our prime.

112
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,480
Once, on my way to see you and your mother,

113
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,500
I met His Majesty.

114
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:28,459
He was just a young person then. But his courage and insight were something to be admired immediately.

115
00:09:28,459 --> 00:09:32,040
We talked for an entire night and became close friends.

116
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,300
Brother Yan is skilled in martial arts.

117
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:42,980
It would be a pity if you don't use your skills to open up new territories.

118
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,140
Worthy little brother, you have such ambitions.

119
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:54,560
I will do my best to convince Big Dipper to help you and your father.

120
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:04,880
At that time, the world was a mess, and warlords and heroes were appearing all the time.

121
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:11,480
Everyone wanted to make a name for themselves, including your father.

122
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:15,880
But Brother Leng just didn't think the same.

123
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,639
Older Brother, I lost again.

124
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:39,260
Younger Brother, your sword is vigorous.

125
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:42,560
I don't think it'll be even two years before you'll surpass me.

126
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:48,680
Older Brother, I have something I want to say.

127
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:52,439
There's been so much fighting in the world. These days everyone is vying for supremacy.

128
00:10:52,439 --> 00:10:57,899
It's unbearably chaotic in the Jianghu realm. It's our chance to show our strength.

129
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:02,300
What if... we got involved?

130
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:06,420
On my way back, I met Zhai Wei and Zhai Rong.

131
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:09,559
They are leading the uprising. Most people support them.

132
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:14,180
We can help them with the help of people from other sects in Jianghu.

133
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:17,040
- I believe that in the future-
- Enough.

134
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,620
Don't say any more. I don't agree.

135
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:24,819
Brother, our master taught us all martial arts skills.

136
00:11:24,819 --> 00:11:28,880
Was it just so we could swap useless pointers with each other every day?

137
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,040
I have told you many times.

138
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,680
Big Dipper should never interfere in politics.

139
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,479
Our mission is to share and pass down martial arts skills.

140
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,420
Over the years, no matter how many dynasties there are,

141
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:45,240
we can have only one Big Dipper.

142
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:50,680
Older Brother, when the world is in chaos, who is able to stay out of it?

143
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,180
If people in Jianghu become the hired hands for the courts,

144
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:00,460
then martial artists will lose their identities.

145
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:06,040
Big Dipper doesn't want to interfere and we can't interfere.

146
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,680
Understood.

147
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,259
Older Brother. Older Brother.

148
00:12:15,259 --> 00:12:18,319
Look. I made a suit of armor for Ping'er.

149
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:28,159
Chenfeng, you are now the Master of Tianquan Peak. You can't keep not studying martial arts skills.

150
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:32,819
Brother, it's okay if I can't use martial skills. The Big Dipper still has you here.

151
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:35,519
How is learning martial arts more meaningful than creating weapons?

152
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:39,319
As long as you're always the master here, then I'll always create weapons for you.

153
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,460
Moreover, once Ping'er is older, he'll definitely be more skilled than me.

154
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,140
I'll count on him to protect me.

155
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,139
Don't let the child fall. Let me.

156
00:12:48,139 --> 00:12:50,220
He's quite strong.

157
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:55,080
The child was Lu Ping?

158
00:12:55,080 --> 00:13:00,220
That's right. Older Brother was a serious student of martial arts skills.

159
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:03,040
He didn't care about the secular world.

160
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,940
After the birth of such a talented boy,

161
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:09,500
he only focused on him.

162
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:13,520
Big Dipper would contribute nothing under his leadership.

163
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:20,560
I was full of youth and vigor and angry back then.

164
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:26,260
It was only because of my painstaking efforts that Big Dipper was at its height.

165
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:30,060
It was only because he was the master

166
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:33,700
that I couldn't realize my ambitions.

167
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,480
Therefore, I kept waiting for my chance;

168
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:44,880
until one day I found out about Liu Song's secret.

169
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,720
Back then, Liu Song had just entered Big Dipper.

170
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,500
He didn't elaborate on his identity.

171
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,840
I felt he had a noble spirit about him.

172
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,620
But also seemed to be hiding a lot of secrets.

173
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:09,100
Once, I heard him talking with Older Brother.

174
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:13,780
Today, I was caught by you.

175
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:19,299
I have nothing to say. Kill me if you want.

176
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,740
I can forgive you.

177
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:34,040
But Big Dipper's principle is to never interfere with politics.

178
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,220
Right now, you have two choices.

179
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:42,239
One is, you immediately go down the mountain and continue being the Prince of Dan.

180
00:14:42,239 --> 00:14:46,440
But that means from now on you have no connection with Big Dipper ever again.

181
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,840
The second is, you stay here

182
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:55,059
and from now onward you are no longer a prince. You are just Song of the sixth peak.

183
00:14:55,059 --> 00:14:58,940
And from then on, Big Dipper will always be with you.

184
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:03,820
You also would need to hand over the Thousand Pine Ruler and commander's seal

185
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,540
to prove your determination to stop the war.

186
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,900
Follow me.

187
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,960
After my investigation, Liu Song, the one who claimed he admired martial arts

188
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,880
and came to learn martial skills,

189
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,310
was actually the Prince of Dan.

190
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:24,720
[Big Dipper]

191
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,460
I knew this was my only chance.

192
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:32,800
So I took the initiative to find Zhai Rong.

193
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,660
The time is right.

194
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:45,360
What did you prepare in exchange for this cup of tea?

195
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,460
Liu Song is at Big Dipper.

196
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,839
But Leng Xiutan cares very much about him.

197
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:55,260
As long as he's there, you can't kill Liu Song.

198
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:59,880
You want the commander's seal? I can get it for you.

199
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,140
Then what do you want in return?

200
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:05,440
A chance for a new start.

201
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,280
It's a deal.

202
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,760
At the time, Big Dipper always opened its doors

203
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:28,580
to all the sects in Jianghu to discuss martial arts.

204
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:32,359
In order to get the seal, I took advantage of when Older Brother and his wife

205
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:38,120
took Ping'er down the mountain and drew away Chu Min and Guo Youdao.

206
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,780
Only Liu Song and Chenfeng were left on the mountain.

207
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:47,940
I pretended to leave, saying I was going to see you and your mother.

208
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:56,359
Zhai Rong and his men disguised themselves as a sect and came in.

209
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,600
They took the opportunity to take the seal.

210
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,020
[Big Dipper]

211
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,500
So as not to make them suspicious,

212
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:07,440
I gave the sect, that Zhai Rong disguised their group as, a name:

213
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,760
the Mountain and Sea Gang.

214
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:17,979
If Uncle Leng and them had already left. Why did they suddenly come back?

215
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,800
Was it you that…

216
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,800
Yes. The seal was locked in the Seven Martyr Court.

217
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:31,459
How could we obtain it so easily? A fight was inevitable.

218
00:17:31,459 --> 00:17:35,940
I knew Brother Leng and his wife, in order to suppress Luping's natural six pneumas,

219
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,199
must have lost a lot of their cultivation.

220
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:42,360
I purposely asked for their help to lure them back.

221
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,120
Leng Xiutan, hearing Liu Song was in danger,

222
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,420
hurried back before he was fully recovered.

223
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:53,320
Thanks to Lu Ping, I was able to take them down in one move.

224
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,840
Father.

225
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:01,560
They retreated from Astronomical Observatory all the way to Seven Martyr Court.

226
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,640
They thought I was there to come to the rescue.

227
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,360
He never put his guard up around me.

228
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,500
- Brother. Sister.
- Qiuci.

229
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,059
My wife and I will guard this place.

230
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:16,120
You go to the secret room to help Song and Ping'er and take them away.

231
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,920
Brother.

232
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:08,980
Brother. Brother!

233
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:19,950
[Big Dipper]

234
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Brother, don't worry.

235
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,480
I will be better than you.

236
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,800
I shouldn't have let Lu Chengfeng live.

237
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,260
But I had already killed Brother Leng and his wife.

238
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,740
I couldn't bear

239
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:48,940
to kill my junior.

240
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:51,480
I had no intention to kill them all.

241
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:56,400
But I couldn't let him go and risk spreading the truth.

242
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:00,840
I locked him up in the water prison at Wuji Manor.

243
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,780
I destroyed his memory with drugs.

244
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:09,980
I told people he was out traveling around and that his whereabouts were unknown.

245
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:24,760
So you knew from the beginning that Liu Song was behind the Mountain and Sea Gang.

246
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,860
Yes, that's right.

247
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:30,920
I just didn't think that he had gotten so good at the Pneuma of Essence.

248
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:34,460
Surprisingly, he even created diversions to dodge my men as they searched for him.

249
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:40,200
I never thought they would've hidden the seal in the Thousand Pine Ruler.

250
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,460
Didn't you get the Thousand Pine Ruler back?

251
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:46,719
Can't you let Lu Ping and the others go? Don't make any more mistakes.

252
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:49,080
We can't let the truth get out.

253
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,560
Otherwise, the reputation of Wuji Manor will be destroyed.

254
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:56,859
He is my brother. He is the son of your older brother.

255
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:03,080
Dead men tell no tales.

256
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:06,980
Father, you didn't teach me to be like this.

257
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:11,640
Since childhood, I was taught to be a straightforward and upright hero.

258
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,340
Heroes shouldn't be like this.

259
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,720
How am I not straight forward and upright?!

260
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,080
I single-handedly brought peace among all the disputes these past few years.

261
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,840
I even protected the border

262
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,880
by building Wuji Manor in Jin City.

263
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,700
I earned my position as the Master of Jianghu through my own two hands.

264
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,740
My conscience is clear.

265
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:40,460
The position shows both my ambition and my responsibility.

266
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:47,799
But you started all this by killing and trapping your brothers and fellow disciples.

267
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,660
Now the ones killing people are the Mountain and Sea Gang.

268
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:56,640
If it weren't for me, the Mountain and Sea Gang would be a hundred times more rampant than it is now!

269
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,700
All of Jianghu could have been cut into pieces and swallowed up as separate territories.

270
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,959
Father.

271
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,980
I can live up to the position as a master of martial arts.

272
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,420
This world will always need a hero.

273
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:15,720
Not just me. You will be one, too.

274
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:21,460
Father, I beg you. Lu Ping is my brother through life and death.

275
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:26,779
Zhao Xifan can be merciful. You, Yan Xifan cannot.

276
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,700
You are the successor of the master of martial arts circles.

277
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:33,480
For the sake of the future,

278
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:36,580
you have to think this through thoroughly.

279
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,760
Master, you really are clever.

280
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:54,260
After I sent that item over, something happened at Wuji Manor.

281
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:56,180
Lu Chenfeng created a tremendous uproar at the wedding.

282
00:22:56,180 --> 00:23:00,160
Now, he and Lu Ping are on the run.

283
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,820
Is the item still with Yan Qiuci?

284
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:08,439
Yes. He can't bear to let it go.

285
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:14,720
[Mountain Sea]

286
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:21,140
After so many years,

287
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,700
it seems like he hasn't changed.

288
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:26,660
Help me prepare well.

289
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:31,380
This grace, I have to repay my second brother in person.

290
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,160
Yes.

291
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,020
Why?

292
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,280
Young Master Xifan.

293
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,120
Why?!

294
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,360
Young Master Xifan, we don't have time to indulge in sadness.

295
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:41,399
We have to think about how to make this a win-win situation. Stop Master Yan from killing Lu Ping.

296
00:24:41,399 --> 00:24:45,179
Otherwise, both of them will suffer. Then the Mountain and Sea Gang will have gotten everything they wanted.

297
00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:48,420
In the end, only our loved ones are sad, while the hated ones are happy.

298
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,180
Ziyan, can you help me?

299
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,379
Master. Younger Master…

300
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:16,320
One has to sacrifice something in order to do something big. Give him some time and he will understand.

301
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,059
All right. What's next?

302
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:21,660
Continue to search for Lu Ping and Lu Chenfeng.

303
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:24,600
I will go meet with Princess Xining.

304
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:35,019
Princess, Master Yan has arrived.

305
00:25:35,019 --> 00:25:38,200
Princess Xining.

306
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:43,999
Wen Rui, I have something to talk to Master Yan about.

307
00:25:43,999 --> 00:25:45,099
Leave us.

308
00:25:45,099 --> 00:25:47,419
- Princess.
- Leave us.

309
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,240
Yes.

310
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:04,620
Yan Qiuci, you unscrupulous dog.

311
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,780
You escaped from death.

312
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:13,460
I didn't think to come and get payback but instead searched for Lu Ping.

313
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:18,300
You didn't leak any information to your closest lieutenant general either.

314
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,940
I would boldly hazard a guess

315
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:29,799
that when you were in the water prison, you had already figured it out.

316
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,880
That the events 19 years ago regarding the Seven Peaks, had something to do with not only me,

317
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,240
but also His Majesty.

318
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,300
Master Yan, you have a lot of tricks.

319
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,620
You, Princess, are clever.

320
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,920
I could never understand why

321
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:49,440
His Majesty treated Lu Ping so strangely.

322
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,620
He wanted to make Lu Ping an official but he was still guarded around him.

323
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:59,340
All the evidence can be linked. It was the only explanation.

324
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:05,120
Now the entire alliance against the Mountain and Sea Gang

325
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:10,080
is supported by Wuji Manor. The arrow is already on the string.

326
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,480
Princess, as a loyal woman,

327
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:16,440
you should know the benefit and the harm.

328
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,740
I warn you. I will find Lu Ping.

329
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:24,620
But if you dare hurt him, I will destroy all of Wuji Manor as payment.

330
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,740
Lu Ping, wait for me.

331
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,379
Master, wait for me!

332
00:27:57,379 --> 00:27:58,860
Qin Sang.

333
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,640
Where is my brother?

334
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,159
Why are you two here?

335
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:10,379
We found a way to break the pneuma confinement in Wuyou Valley and came to tell my brother.

336
00:28:10,379 --> 00:28:12,879
Why? Isn't he with you?

337
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:19,430
Stop talking about Lu Ping. She looks a little off. Let me check your pulse first.

338
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:23,400
Don't rush to check my pulse. You came at just the right time.

339
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,560
Let's go find Lu Ping together.

340
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,340
This… This…

341
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,000
What is it?

342
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,460
No.

343
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,519
Thank you, Ziyan.

344
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:06,680
Let's hope the effects last until we're done with everything.

345
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:16,700
Father, you taught me to be upright and straightforward since I was a child.

346
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,080
To be a brave hero.

347
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,100
I hope that you will always be that hero.

348
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:29,400
The mistakes you've made in the past, I will make up for you.

349
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:35,900
I just hope you won't hate me later.

350
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,660
Old White,

351
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,780
I didn't take good care of you well enough.

352
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:22,440
I am afraid.

353
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:26,620
Don't be afraid Uncle. I am Ping'er.

354
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,160
Ping'er.

355
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:36,140
After Ping'er grows up, he'll definitely be more skilled than I am. Then I can count on him to protect me.

356
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:40,120
- Don't let the child fall.
- He is quite strong.

357
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,400
Who is Ping'er?

358
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:53,059
- How long has it been?!
- How long has it been since you took the medicine? Have you regained your memory?

359
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:07,060
Brother. Brother.

360
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:11,080
Sister-in-Law. Where is Sister-in-Law?

361
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,160
Brother.

362
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,320
Your brother wants you to eat properly.

363
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,760
Get some good rest.

364
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:25,120
And the bad guy? What about the bad guy?

365
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:29,060
Don't worry. Brother will help you take care of him.

366
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,580
Brother!

367
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,260
Are you okay?

368
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:42,510
I urged Mo Lin to hurry, but we were still late.

369
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:45,579
Why are you blaming me again? I almost broke my legs from all the running.

370
00:31:45,579 --> 00:31:49,480
I am okay. It's just that I found out some information.

371
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,860
Why are two you here?

372
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:55,520
We were in Wuyou Valley and accidentally learned from my father that

373
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:59,659
the pneuma confinement on you was created by your parents and my father.

374
00:31:59,659 --> 00:32:03,600
And your parents lost most of their cultivation because of it.

375
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,050
I thought it was strange. So I wanted to tell you immediately.

376
00:32:07,579 --> 00:32:09,900
Lost most of their cultivation…

377
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,280
Don't kill me.

378
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,640
Boss, who is he?

379
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:23,479
I have to go take care of something. Take care of Old White.

380
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:30,640
Don't kill me. Don't kill me.

381
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,660
Lu Ping, I have something to tell you.

382
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:42,900
You can't stay at Wuji Manor. Take Su Tang, Mo Lin, and Lu Chengfeng back to Big Dipper.

383
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:45,420
I will ask Wen Rui to cover you.

384
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:48,480
Yan Qiuci wanted to kill us yesterday to keep us quiet.

385
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,880
You're surrendering to him today?

386
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:56,760
I didn't surrender. We need Wuji Manor to eliminate the Mountain and Sea Gang.

387
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,160
I understand.

388
00:32:59,294 --> 00:33:01,074
It is for the bigger picture.

389
00:33:01,714 --> 00:33:03,960
The Mountain and Sea Gang killed Qin Qi.

390
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,960
Are you willing to let them go?

391
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:16,420
If for the bigger picture we can't tell right from wrong anymore,

392
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:19,319
then what are we protecting?

393
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,160
- Lu Ping.
- Qin Sang.

394
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,560
I'm not like you.

395
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:30,180
I can clearly tell right from wrong. Please go back.

396
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:36,720
Lu Ping, Yan Qiuci is Xifan's father.

397
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,960
If you kill him, will it bring back your parents?

398
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,130
Aren't you afraid that the gang will be more rampant if you kill him?

399
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:51,380
I am a nobody. I can't think about that much.

400
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:55,280
And I don't have the energy to think about it. If you block me again—

401
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,940
Then what?

402
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:22,800
Are you okay?

403
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:34,219
You've been poisoned. The poison has already started to attack your heart.

404
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,120
Don't tell anyone.

405
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:10,620
Let's talk at midnight in the manor. Uncle Yan.

406
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:20,220
- Young Master, you mean…
- Do you need me to say it again?

407
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:25,099
Tonight all the disciples will return to their rooms. Don't light the lanterns. Don't go out.

408
00:35:25,099 --> 00:35:30,600
Anyone who disobeys will be dispelled from the manor. Understand?

409
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,600
But Master ordered that…

410
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:38,120
He ordered that everyone listens to my orders.

411
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,540
Yes, Sir.

412
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,100
What are you planning to do?

413
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:02,260
Ziyan, get some sleep.

414
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:06,560
When you wake up, everything will have been taken care of.

Are you here to stop me?

418
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:00,780
I just wanted to see if I could persuade you

419
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,740
to give my father another chance.

420
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:07,240
When you were in Zhaifeng, did you ever succeed?

421
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:17,740
I know that you never give up once you've made up your mind.

422

I'm the one that has to be accommodating.

I'm sorry.

424

As the son of my parents, I have to hold someone accountable.

Uncle Yan, there's something I want to ask you.

430
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:45,400
Are you the one who killed my parents?

431
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,700
Yes.

432
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:52,440
Did you attack me and Qin Sang, and imprison us in the water prison?

433
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,440
Yes.

434
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:05,280
Back then the death of your parents was indeed my fault.

I'm waiting for you here today, to confess my mistakes.

436

If you wanted to make up for your mistakes,

437
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:17,060
why did you want to kill me and Uncle Lu?

438
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:21,100
The more I wanted to cover up the matter, the deeper I got.

439
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:23,380
I did it involuntarily.

440
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,960
But now that I've got the Thousand Pine Ruler,

441
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:31,000
I believe that you will be able to bring an end to the disaster caused by the Mountain and Sea Gang.

442
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,620
Today, I promise to accept three of your moves.

443
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:39,679
Whether I live or die, I'll leave it up to fate. After three moves, I hope you will forget the hatred.

You look down upon me too much.

00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:58,380
I hope that you won't blame Xifan.

Okay. I promise you.

♫ Like the author, roughly put down with a weak stroke, ♫

473
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:33,180
♫ the writing boat on the lake was just
like a paper crane in the air ♫

474
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:38,080
♫ Laughing like the moon, ♫

475
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:42,740
♫ regretting the lighthouse broke in the waves, ♫

476
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:51,000
♫ I call the Milky Way that isolates us all, blue ♫

477
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:57,720
♫ Can a moat be built on the seabed? ♫

478
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:02,150
♫ Wipe all the words on the paper boat! ♫

479
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:09,530
♫ Please let someone not remember and don't tell another! ♫

480
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:16,590
♫ Hide the reluctance between words ♫

481
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:21,180
♫ Unfortunately, I (you) am (are) an average author ♫

482
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:28,750
♫ No matter how you (I) describe the rest, it's unnecessary! ♫

483
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:39,760
♫ Don't describe my unfulfilled promise! ♫

484
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:48,490
♫ Don't interpret my hidden fire-smoke! ♫

485
00:45:48,490 --> 00:45:57,490
♫ Don't let the paper boat in the rough wave chasing me! ♫

486
00:45:57,490 --> 00:46:06,140
♫ Don't wait until it's over to know there are you and me! ♫
