00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,880
♫ The dark green sea is hazy ♫

3
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,720
♫ dissipating in a flash. ♫

4
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,630
♫ Rivers and lakes divide the world. ♫

5
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,980
♫ Ten thousands arrows are firing at once. ♫

6
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:43,890
♫ Who has time to worry? Who loves the color of blood? ♫

7
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,750
♫ At that time, spirits are high. ♫

8
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:51,660
♫ Everywhere is home, who can dare let his horse freely run? ♫

9
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,370
♫ Silently, tears form in the death of night. ♫

10
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:58,240
♫ Heroes are cutting all ties, ♫

11
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,060
♫ giving up whether it's life or death, ♫

12
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,170
♫ never asking what the cost is. ♫

13
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:09,820
♫ Good and evil must be distinguished. ♫

14
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,760
♫ The wind blows off the snow. ♫

15
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,540
♫ On the body, etch multiple scars, ♫

16
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,730
♫ wandering all over the world, ♫

17
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:25,200
♫ only wish to ask for answers from this world. ♫

18
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,220
♫ A teenager doesn't have to be a hero. ♫

19
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,110
♫ There is no need for flowers in the dream. ♫

20
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:35,260
♫ Destiny need not be afraid. ♫

21
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:40,750
♫ Because you have him all the way, ♫

22
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:44,650
♫ experienced a handful of conquests, ♫

23
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:48,570
♫ overcame a number of challenges. ♫

24
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,710
♫ From now on, happy and free! ♫

25

00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:22,680
[Episode 14]

29
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:27,740
The storyteller told a very ridiculous story.

30
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,500
A hunter's home got caught on fire.

31
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,700
A fox who was to be killed and skinned

32
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,180
seized the opportunity to escape.

33
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:41,320
It was saved by a farmer.

34
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,320
Just as when the fox was recovered

35
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,200
and was about to bid farewell to the farmer,

36
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,000
it discovered that the farmer was sharpening his knife.

37
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:55,160
It turned out that he was the same as the hunter.

38
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,260
I just couldn't understand.

39
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:03,160
The farmer disguised himself for so long, just for the fur of the fox.

40
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,880
Master, what are you in disguise for then?

41
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:14,360
You said you cared for Wind Taker Institute.

42
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,160
But you didn't stop me

43
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:21,280
from giving up the convention.

44
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:27,020
You even followed me to Xinghua House

45
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,220
and tasted the Apricot Blossom Wine.

46
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,920
Why did you do these?

47
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,280
Let's end it here!

48
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,519
You are drunk, I'll escort you to your room.

49
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:09,380
That day at Xinghua House, Uncle Wen hurt a man from the Mountain and Sea Gang.

50
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,579
Why do you have the same scar on your body?

51
00:04:12,579 --> 00:04:15,220
Just give me an explanation,

52
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,290
I'll believe you.

53
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,930
It's been three years.

54
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:24,100
I can finally see

55
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,340
the result.

56
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:59,160
Impossible! Master can't be from the Mountain and Sea Gang!

57
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,220
Zhao Xifan, the scar doesn't tell lie.

58
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,620
Sangsang, you've come to see me.

59
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,860
I know you care about me.

60
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,200
Wei Tianqi, how did you hurt yourself?

61
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,899
- Sangsang…
- Say!

62
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:22,259
Xinghua House! I got hurt there!

63
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,240
[Lu Ping]

64
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,720
- That day, I was in the restaurant.
- Minister Wen.

65
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,160
I met Minister Wen under the name of Lu Ping.

66
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,380
He looked strange.

67
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:43,440
At that time, all the customers stood up and came at once.

68
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,760
They said I was to blame.

69
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,640
I was to be killed.

70
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,000
Look what you do to my plan!

71
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:13,080
I didn't guess that the whole thing was ordered by Wen Gecheng.

72
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,960
Don't leave anyone alive!

73
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,360
Mountain and Sea Gang Seal!

74
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,120
Young Master! It is important.

75
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,040
Give it to your father!

76
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,820
I have no idea what it is.

77
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:53,360
Wei Ying gave it to me desperately and told me to keep it well.

78
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,170
You...

79
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:10,720
I thought I would die that day.

80
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,040
Suddenly a man in black came.

81
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,160
I was saved.

82
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,340
Later on, I can't remember what happened next.

83
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,960
It's Wen Gecheng's seal.

84
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,159
Didn't he take Lu Ping to break the the Lock?

85
00:07:27,159 --> 00:07:29,280
Why did he plan to kill you?

86
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:35,700
What Wei Tianqi got into was the trap that had been prepared for Lu Ping.

87
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,420
The person behind all of this

88
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,920
is the real superior of the Mountain and Sea Gang.

89
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,780
It's Wen Gecheng!

90
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:49,280
Why did he incite Lu Ping to fight against Guo Youdao?

91
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,680
I'm afraid that the person who saved Wei Tianqi is our Master.

92
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,060
Wen Gecheng thought him as a hindrance so he did that.

93
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,980
Qin Sang, go back to the inn and stop Lu Ping.

94
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,240
Congratulations, Wind Division Leader!

95
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,980
Miss Qin, please excuse me.

96
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:08,059
Sure enough! The Wei Family have colluded with the Mountain and Sea Gang.

97
00:09:08,059 --> 00:09:12,580
Wei Ming, since we have been discovered, no one can live.

98
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,340
Indeed,

99
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,060
you are the Leader of the Wind Division!

100
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,460
Awakener,

101
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,560
it's time to go back.

102
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,560
Eldest Senior!

103
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,500
Master Chu Min.

104
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,760
You all have been secretive,

105
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,780
also let her trick me into going back to the Tripitaka Sutra Pavilion, and even wanted to lock me in.

106
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:06,840
Say! What are you doing?

107
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:11,180
Master Chu Min, we have to return to the inn to help Master.

108
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,520
Congratulations, Wind Division Leader Wen!

109
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,690
It's been three years since you ruined your martial arts.

110
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:13,850
It was all for making such a success today.

111
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:19,240
If I wouldn't have done that, how could Qin Qi believe me?

112
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:24,420
I could only gain his trust if I can't protect myself.

113
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:27,540
Wind Division Leader Wen were once so glorious

114
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:33,160
but now, just a Bone-piercing Needle can hurt you like this.

115
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:37,120
Is it worth such sacrifice?

116
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:45,620
I will not hesitate to sacrifice my life for the Master.

117
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,179
I already asked my people to dispose Guo Youdao's body.

118
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:57,200
Please send more people for I have to take Lu Ping back myself.

119
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,100
Wen Gecheng.

120
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:02,040
Wen Gecheng!

121
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,340
Wind Division takes charge of intelligent information.

122
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,400
Fire Division is for catching people.

123
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,200
Do you think that kid is down on luck every time?

124
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,060
This time, it won't be your turn.

125
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,380
If Situ Chong of the Fire Division didn't lose the Mountain and Sea token,

126
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,690
how can there be those mistakes these days?

127
00:12:16,699 --> 00:12:21,640
Master has waited for three years, are you going to extend his waiting?

128
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:26,600
Let's see whether you can use what Master gave or not.

129
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,540
Su Tang has been crying.

130
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:58,560
I've comforted her but don't expect me to do that for you.

131
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:04,540
I can't protect the people around me every time.

132
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,380
I'll ask my brother for help.

133
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:13,040
One is the subordinate who followed him for three years.

134
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,000
The other is a stranger defeating you in the Pneuma Combat Convention.

135
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,300
Whom do you think he'll help without evidence?

136
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,420
Since you have guessed as such, why don't you go searching?

137
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:30,199
Weak, irresolute, and always complaining,

138
00:13:30,199 --> 00:13:34,540
I, Chumin, don't have such a student like you.

139
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:38,520
Eldest Senior, you said that

140
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,960
you wouldn't leave anyone from Wind Takers behind.

141
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:54,840
Yes, I said that.

142
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,860
I will definitely keep my word.

143
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:02,080
Miss Qin, please help!

144
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,400
Call me Qin Sang.

145
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,140
I will find evidence in the Zhiwei Study.

146
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:11,219
Wait for me! Agile Dragon Army will surely come.

147
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,080
Did Mo Lin wake up?

148
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,360
You are asking me to smell all around Kaifeng for Lu ping?

149
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,160
- Eldest Senior, you must be crazy!
- He once escaped from the Mountain and Sea Gang.

150
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,650
He must have been desperate to think of a way.

151
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,800
Mo Lin!

152
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:12,680
Su Tang, your brother isn't like you, he is crafty.

153
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:17,440
He is now very healthy and waiting for us to get to him.

154
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,900
It's cold in the north, take care of yourself!

155
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,000
Are you caring about me?

156
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,360
Or, are you addicted to the acting of Minister Wen?

157
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:08,820
If you had left with me that day in the Xinghua House,

158
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,239
you would have been better.

159
00:16:11,239 --> 00:16:13,780
I have been trapped by you

160
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,280
since the Pneumatic Combat Convention,

161
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,660
right?

162
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,440
I am going to die.

163
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,880
Still don't want to let me know?

164
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,400
In as big of a city as Kaifeng,

165
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:38,800
a sloppy action only alarms the enemy as well as General Qin Qi.

166
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:44,720
The only thing I could do is to let you come to me.

167
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:19,940
So, the outbreak of my the Pneuma Confinement that day...

168
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:24,440
It was because of the drugs lit in the Zhiwei Study.

169
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:31,780
Your pneumatic powers were intensified and the Pneuma Confinement would be tightened.

170
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:35,900
Lu Ping, remember what I said

171
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:40,120
no one can leave the Mountain and Sea Gang.

172
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,840
Let's go!

173
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:10,629
Master. Lu Ping?

174
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,880
Guo Youdao.

175
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:20,080
- It's good that you are alive.
- See it?

176
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,279
I've told you that Minmin pretended to be cold but in her heart,

177
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:26,300
- she actually missed me—
- Shut up!

178
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:35,420
Wen Gecheng, you don't know me,

179
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,700
let alone my Master.

180
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:41,940
I found out for all these years that the only way to live

181
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,360
is to take the initiative.

182
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,060
As for my Master,

183
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,000
you still have a lot to learn from his acting.

184
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:56,660
He is the little fox in the story.

185
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:02,099
The old one returned it to life, the young one must send him a present

186
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:05,900
to make Wen Gecheng understand his death.

187
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:14,920
Master, the moon is so beautiful.

188
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,900
Drink with me!

189
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,859
No way! I got drunk last night. No more drink!

190
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:24,279
Okay! You refused the invitation and chose the threat.

191
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:26,180
What with your attitude? I will not drink.

192
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,930
What will you do?

193
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:37,740
Master, without treating your injury, your arm will be ruined.

194
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,620
It doesn't matter with such a little injury.

195
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:47,620
You already knew that I was hurt by that Wei Zhong's beating.

196
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:53,160
Master, don't tell a lie that could be easily destroyed

197
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,080
by simply looking at your scar.

198
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:59,060
Uncle Wen hinted several times that we has had a spy from the Mountain and Sea Gang.

199
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:03,999
The person who followed me to Xinghua House, except Xifan, Su Tang and Mo Lin,

200
00:20:03,999 --> 00:20:06,200
was only you.

201
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:12,160
All the evidence shows that you lied to me.

202
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,300
Since you don't believe me,

203
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,200
why do you still come and find me for a confrontation?

204
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:23,560
You said that you are not willing to let me die before I pay off my debt.

205
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,340
So I've placed a bet

206
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,720
on your bit of kindness.

207
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:35,930
What are you doing? Can't you be gentler?

208
00:20:36,639 --> 00:20:39,760
- It hurts...
- So can you tell me the truth now?

209
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:47,060
The reason I came to Xinghua House was all to protect you.

210
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:52,020
Who knew that Wen Gecheng had set a trap there for you?

211
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,840
Initially, I even thought that he wouldn't easily reveal himself

212
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:58,560
but I didn't expect that he killed all three guards from the Wei Family.

213
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,639
Wei Tianqi was also almost died by his hands.

214
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,020
Then, he said with certainty that the Mountain and Sea Gang was to blame.

215
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:08,440
I have suspected him since then.

216
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:13,400
Tonight, I planned to check on the situation in Wen's mansion.

217
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,400
Don't bother!

218
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,160
He, first, hurt himself and then he blamed you for all these things.

219
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,500
He wanted me to kill you in his place.

220
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:28,040
No one can do such a thing except the Mountain and Sea Gang.

221
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,320
I'll send you off to hide for a while.

222
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,720
Slow down!

223
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:37,660
Master, I discovered someone is monitoring us outside.

224
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:43,480
If I didn't fight with you, they would definitely suspect us.

225
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:48,540
Since you love acting so much, why not accompany me for another show?

226
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,750
People from the Mountain and Sea Gang are prudent.

227
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,840
They would always suspect others.

228
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,940
However, no one would suspect someone whom they thought was already dead.

229
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:07,480
People who were to handle Master's body were all handled by Master.

230
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:12,000
Wen Gecheng, it's your turn to come with me.

231
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,960
Lu Ping, you even learned to plot now.

232
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,840
However, the Mountain and Sea Gang was not like the gang in the past.

233
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,080
Why me?

234
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,800
I am just a poor boy from the countryside.

235
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:53,720
You guys from the Mountain and Sea Gang are going to rule the world.

236
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,160
What does that have to do with me?

237
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,520
Why are you fixated on me?

238
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,880
You underestimated yourself.

239
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:05,220
- What do you mean?
- What do I mean?

240
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:08,000
I'll tell you after returning to the Mountain and Sea Gang.

241
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,660
There is a bamboo forest at the end of the river.

242
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:28,340
Wen Gecheng must go ashore there and wait for help.

243
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:30,660
We can save Lu Ping there.

244
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:33,180
But he seems to be leveled up by using Marrow Washing technique.

245
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:37,560
- Now this—
- If we are to save Lu Ping, we need a sword.

246
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:43,860
A sword which sees through the disguise and defeats all.

247
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:46,980
Master, I forget how to use such a sword.

248
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:51,240
Xifan, to atone is not to suffer.

249
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,360
It is for you to be able to

250
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:59,220
recapture the things you lost in the past.

251
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,880
Do you still remember why you first used a sword?

252
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:10,360
Master, I understand.

253
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:13,660
No one from Wind Takers will be left behind.

254
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:20,100
The Mountain and Sea Gang might have an alternative plan.

255
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:23,600
Lu Ping has to face all these.

256
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:26,020
I can't hide him anymore.

257

It is his fate.

258
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:30,240
To fight against it or to obey it.

259
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,080
He has no other way.

00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:58,220
Microscopy is, indeed, powerful.

324
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:04,300
Can you see your own end?

325
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,100
I told you.

326
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,140
Stop playing me!

327
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:06,140
Lu Ping.

328
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,740
Lu Ping.

329
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,780
Break Mark!

330
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:18,100
A kind of Pneuma of Pivot that is rarely seen in a century!

331
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:21,480
You can use it just by the eyes of your enemy.

332
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:25,480
Sadly, you have met Microscopy.

333
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:29,120
You can't play me for the second time with the same trick!

334
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:34,020
Lu Ping, do you really think you know yourself?

335
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:39,280
Do you really think an Awakener like you can be born in the countryside?

336
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:43,020
Don't you want to see your parents back in the Mountain and Sea Gang?

337
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,060
What did you say?

338
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:49,060
Your parents loved you.

339
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:51,400
They miss you.

340
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,820
But they both died

341
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:57,460
in the Mountain and Sea Gang.

342
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:10,400
Xifan, to atone is not to suffer.

343
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,680
It is for you to be able to

344
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:18,680
recapture the things you lost in the past.

345
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:32,400
Sword of Yan Family.

346
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,660
Brother!

347
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:53,480
Brother!

348
00:35:56,780 --> 00:36:00,000
Let me see! Where is your wound?

349
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,480
It looks like I, the world's number 1 assassin, seem to become better.

350
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:07,479
What about you? Are you okay? We are late.

351
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:13,670
A mysterious man saved us.

352
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:15,240
Brother.

353
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:19,700
I am so lucky! He was killed just by one arrow.

354
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:23,679
Yes! Fortunately, you've arrived in time, so I'm okay.

355
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:28,360
But I want to ask him how to break the Pneuma Confinement for Lu Ping.

356
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:43,719
- Master, we have searched around but we can't find Master Wen.
- Search again!

357
00:36:43,719 --> 00:36:46,400
Bring him if he's alive and his body if he's dead!

358
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:58,420
My little disciple, let's play a game.

359
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,300
Guess the number of peanuts in my hands is odd or even?

360
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:06,199
If you are wrong, you have to formally acknowledge me as your master, what do you think?

361
00:37:06,199 --> 00:37:09,279
If you lose, stop following me all day.

362
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,880
Sure.

363
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,920
Odd!

364
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,259
Thanks Master Chu Min! Thanks.

365
00:37:33,259 --> 00:37:36,319
- Master Chu Min.
- Say no and mean yes.

366
00:37:36,319 --> 00:37:38,960
You'll regret later.

367
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:53,160
Then, let's find a nice day for our acknowledgement.

368
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:56,179
Good! Pupil, eat more. Eat more!

369
00:37:56,179 --> 00:37:58,779
Come, come, come! Here!

370
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:24,579
Pneuma of Vision and Pneuma of Strength mutually promote Wild Sword in Northwest.

371
00:38:24,579 --> 00:38:28,100
I heard a young master from Wuji Manor was lost.

372
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,950
Yan Xifan.

373
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:34,980
I've been rude for what I saw today. Pardon me!

374
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:37,260
It's just a family name.

375
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:41,000
It's not bad to be called Zhao Xifan for four years.

376
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:44,760
Toast!

377
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:50,360
I hid my name for my life.

378
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,280
What about you?

379
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:56,140
I couldn't save my friend before.

380
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:59,480
I felt sorry for the name, the Sword of Yan Family.

381
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,559
Now it's different.

382
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:04,520
I am happy to help you.

383
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:07,440
How can you, a Young Master, be so melancholy?

384
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,520
You don't want to go home when you have one.

385
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:14,000
Look at me! I don't even know where my home is.

386
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:17,140
I come to tell you,

387
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:20,560
what Wen Gecheng said was just to irritate you.

388
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,520
You don't have to bear it in mind.

389
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,060
I have been searching for three years,

390
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,120
and I've found the fake one.

391
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:38,840
I thought initially that I

392
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,220
was from an ordinary family.

393
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:44,130
But Wen Gecheng told me

394
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:49,080
my parents were killed by the Mountain and Sea Gang.

395
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,920
I thought I would be free once

396
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,880
I entered Pneuma Combat Convention.

397
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,280
In the end,

398
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,840
I found only mysteries

399
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,980
and a blood feud.

400
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:19,080
All in all,

401
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,960
I still found nothing.

402
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:30,560
At least you have Wind Takers and us as your brothers-in-arms.

403
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:34,460
Lu Ping, if your parents were alive,

404
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:39,460
they would surely be proud of you.

405
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,980
I didn't know that

406
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:46,780
you usually don't talk much but, now, you are good at comforting.

407
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:50,039
Stop the nonsense! Let's just drink.

408
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,760
Lu Ping,

409
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:07,600
do you remember what I said?

410
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:12,020
It was taught by my father.

411
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:17,020
We learn martial arts to stand out from others

412
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:19,900
and to protect the country and our people.

413
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:25,300
After winning at the convention, you don't have to hide.

414
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:28,320
You can use your pneumatic powers in the right way.

415
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,160
Eldest Senior,

416
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,480
what is the right way?

417
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:44,920
Qin Qi wiped out the Mountain and Sea Gang by using Agile Dragon Army the right way.

418
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:48,000
But the Agile Dragon Army aimed to kill Ling Ziyan,

419
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,960
is that because she's on the evil path?

420
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:55,280
Eldest Senior, you told me to choose the right way, but what is it?

421
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,839
Ling Ziyan defected Sun Streamer Swordplay and was forced to this point.

422
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:03,180
Wen Gecheng said that I was important.

423
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:05,360
If one day

424
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:08,400
I break the the lock,

425
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,500
yet the Power of Awakening is used by them,

426
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:15,680
will I have a same end as her?

427
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:23,059
Not necessarily! The tradition of the Wind Takers is that no one is left behind.

428
00:42:23,059 --> 00:42:27,800
As long as I am alive, it will never happen.

429
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,520
Trust me!

430
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:35,660
Don't worry, Eldest Senior!

431
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:40,100
As long as there are Wind Taker Institute and our brothers,

432
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:42,860
I will not give in,

433
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:45,460
no matter what the Mountain and Sea Gang wants.

434
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:47,660
I will never be afraid.

435
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:59,780
Although you forget your parents,

436
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:04,040
they must have heard the words you just said.

437
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:27,540

00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:07,900
♫ Like a kite being pulled into a low altitude, ♫

♫ I call the Milky Way that isolates us all, blue. ♫
