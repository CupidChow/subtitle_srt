00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,940
♫ The dark green sea is hazy ♫

3
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:32,820
♫ dissipating in a flash. ♫

4
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,600
♫ Rivers and lakes divide the world. ♫

5
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,970
♫ Ten thousands arrows are firing at once. ♫

6
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:43,940
♫ Who has time to worry? Who loves the color of blood? ♫

7
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:47,830
♫ At that time, spirits are high. ♫

8
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:51,580
♫ Who calls the world his home? Who dares let his horse freely run? ♫

9
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:54,290
♫ Silently, tears form in the death of night. ♫

10
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:58,270
♫ Heroes are cutting all ties, ♫

11
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:02,080
♫ giving up whether it's life or death, ♫

12
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,190
♫ never asking what the cost is. ♫

13
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:09,820
♫ Good and evil must be distinguished. ♫

14
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,740
♫ The wind blows off the snow. ♫

15

♫ On the body, etch multiple scars, ♫

16
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,750
♫ wandering all over the world, ♫

17
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:25,240
♫ only wish to ask for answers from this world. ♫

Are you okay?

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,840
I am fine.

31
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,619
You just said that you like me,

32
00:02:35,619 --> 00:02:37,999
and you wouldn't hesitate to go through fire and water for me.

33

Is it true or were you just acting?

I'll tell you when this is all over.

Boss, can you flirt at another time?

36
00:02:50,539 --> 00:02:52,519
I saw Eldest Senior in the city.

37

He got into the lodging in disguise.

38
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,420
The Mountain and Sea Gang is going to destroy the peace talk

39
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,920
but Qin Qi values the peace talk.

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,780
Now that Xifan is involved, this issue is getting more troublesome.

42
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,660
Xu Tianbing is a general with such a narrow mind.

00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,320
General, why were you so enduring?

44
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:19,659
Xu Tianbing is domineering but he is also the general of Tan.

45
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:24,060
There must be some issues for his willfulness.

Who is that?

Go and get our brothers to guard here, I will go and take a look.

50
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,600
This is no trivial matter, make no move without careful thought.

51
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:50,060
Mo Lin, you try to distract them for me to go in and find Qin Qi.

- What trick are you trying to play?
- General Qin.

64

Even if you are the first general of Shuo,

Now you've hurt me with a hidden weapon.

70
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,840
Does the Mountain and Sea Gang really think this will stop the peace talk?

71
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,160
Killing the generals of the two countries will only make us share the same hatred.

72
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,800
General Qin, you look down too much on the Mountain and Sea Gang.

73
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,120
I heard that Xu Tianbing had bad temper

74
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,000
and that he's argued with you several times before.

It's well known that you two don't get along well.

Try to imagine that!

- You're setting me up!
- Exactly! I'm setting you up.

But isn't that what General Qin does best?

81
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:33,100
You hid the identity of the Wen Gecheng before.

82
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:38,679
You set us up for murdering the official and had me on the run this whole way.

Did you ever think that retribution would fall on you so soon?

00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:54,580
It's Lu Ping who solved this puzzle for me.

162
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:03,400
That brat, even the Mountain and Sea Gang has been tricked by him.

163

Miss, don't blame the general.

164
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:09,580
He did it for our state.

165
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:17,280
Sang'er, what kind of person is Lu Ping?

166
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:22,000
I remembered he was a young man acting on impulse when in Kaifeng.

167
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,480
However, his action today really impressed me.

168
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,280
He is not like you, Brother.

169
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,940
He has no ambition about the country.

170
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,160
He is timid sometimes.

171
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,960
He is afraid of pain.

172
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,010
But he is responsible.

173
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:46,820
He never flinches when he needs to step forward.

174
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:53,220
I believe that when he asked you to leave,

175
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,140
he had already made up his mind.

176
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,940
He is a brave man and I respect him.

177
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:05,880
Brother, is there anything we can do to help him?

178
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,500
This matter is well planned and closely linked.

179
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,880
The Mountain and Sea Gang must have someone on the inside helping them.

180
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:19,980
Wen Rui, help me investigate someone.

When did Xu Tianbing's body get moved into the lodging?

Whom did Yan Xifan pretend to be that

184
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:33,840
he could sneak into the lodging without being suspected?

185

- Who are they?
- They are from the Agile Dragon Army.

188
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:25,080

Didn't Young Lord Yan also come empty handed?

You still dare to insult me?

193

Lu Ping appeared all of sudden and messed up my entire plan.

If I hadn't left in time, Chief would have been the one who's in trouble right now.

No idea where Zhou Youlong is right now, do you?

197

Chief, the Mountain and Sea Gang doesn't need such a loser.

How we lost today, I can't bear it.

Why don't I kill him on behalf of our gang?

- Chief.
- Enough! Stop it!

Thank you, Chief.

204
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:25,760
Xu Weifeng, when you came to us,

205
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,520
you should've understood that you have to be useful to the Mountain and Sea Gang.

206
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,640
If you are useless,

207

you and even Tan state, to the Mountain and Sea Gang,

208

are not worth mentioning.

209
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:42,219
Chief, it's still not a complete failure.

210
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,440
Xu Tianbing has great prestige in the Tan Army.

My father controlled the news of his assassination in order to assist the peace talk to proceed smoothly.

But rumors are invisible swords.

213
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,940
If I leak the information saying that Lu Ping was instructed by Qin Qi,

214

the army will never forgive them.

If there is a mutiny in the army, the country will have to fight whether they want to or not.

216
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,080
As for Lu Ping, I'll try to force him admit it.

217

You're dreaming!

Remember! You won't have the third chance.

were you sorely disappointed when you learned that it was me

00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,820
and not Qin Qi, who killed him?

234
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,640
- Leave us!
- Yes.

235
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,420
You already knew.

Qin Qi was led in by Yan Xifan.

When Mo Lin told me back then,

240
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:34,380
I already figured it out.

241
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,580
I was just a little bit late.

Otherwise, I would've made you lose even worse.

243

I don't understand why you would take the blame for Qin Qi.

He showed no mercy to you before.

Lu Ping,

249

you're now guilty of a capital offense.

250
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:08,299
Qin Qi can't save you, and Qin Sang is in worse position so she can't save you, either.

The one who can save you,

252
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,120
is only me.

253
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,910
I just didn't expect that

254
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:26,160
you chose to sacrifice yourself to break the game.

255
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,000
However, I've actually always respected you quite a bit.

256
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,799
My gratitude to you was true in the Seven Martyrs Court and at the gate of Yuezhou.

A complete hypocrite.

264
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:02,740
Right now, you are just like the Mountain and Sea Gang.

265
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:05,400
Didn't you want to know who the real murderer was?

266
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,740
Didn't I already tell you?

267
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,680
It's me.

268
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,740
If you want to know other things, just get lost.

How about Su Tang?

270
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,420
Don't you care about her?

271
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,720
You have the Mountain and Sea Gang supporting you from behind

272
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,380
but I am not alone, either.

273
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,380
I promise you!

274
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:53,100
If you even touch one of hair on Su Tang's head,

275
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,300
you will die without a burial lace.

276
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:02,460
Moreover, if you fail this mission,

277
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,840
do you think the Mountain and Sea Gang will let you go easily?

278
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:11,500
Senior Xu, what do you think

279
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:16,500
how I have this ability of being able to suffer a beating?

280
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,200
Dealing with demons,

281
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,940
aren't you afraid of getting bitten to death?

282
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,819
We have no further news from those two who were sent to track Xu Weifeng.

283
00:22:35,819 --> 00:22:37,940
They might have been killed.

284
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,340
Looks like there really is something wrong with Xu Weifeng.

285
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:45,779
Now that we know, should we report it to Tan and save Lu Ping?

286
00:22:45,779 --> 00:22:47,060
No way!

287
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,580
Oral expressions cannot be taken as evidence.

288
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:55,699
Right now, the peace talk can continue all because Minister Xu has been holding off the news that Xu Tianbing is dead.

289
00:22:55,699 --> 00:22:59,900
However, Xu Weifeng is the son of Xu Yanling so words alone aren't enough for evidence.

290
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:03,199
If we speak rashly, it will only make Minister Xu look biased.

291
00:23:03,199 --> 00:23:07,199
Right now, only if we can secure the evidence and give it to Tan, then we can control the damage.

292
00:23:07,199 --> 00:23:08,800
General Qin.

293
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,019
General Qin, bad news!

294
00:23:12,019 --> 00:23:15,420
Right now, somehow the army has found out that Xu Tianbing is dead.

295
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:18,799
Now, the soldiers are angry and they want to fight.

296
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,640
I really can't control them.

297
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,179
General Qin, why are you putting this off?

298
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:25,740
What do you want, Minister Xia?

299
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:29,339
Lu Ping comes from our country but he is the murderer.

300
00:23:29,339 --> 00:23:32,760
His execution will calm the army.

301
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:36,340
What do you want to do with his life after all this?

302
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:39,740
Minister Xia, I have my own opinions on this.

303
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:43,259
The conflict may break out at any moment so what's the point of your opinions?

304
00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:48,040
Do you want to wait until the army mutinies to fight against Shuo?

00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:15,230
Brother, I already heard everything.

306
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:18,040
Do you really have to kill Lu Ping?

307
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,600
Brother, Lu Ping didn't kill anyone.

308
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,460
He is a scapegoat for you and for Shuo.

309
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:29,300
Everything is a mess right now.

310
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,980
I can only do my best to change the situation for him

311
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,940
but I can't guarantee anything.

312
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,760
I don't have the decision making power.

313
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:40,720
If it gets to the point that you have to choose,

314
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,260
will you kill him?

315
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,740
Sang'er,...

316
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:55,520
I had thought that if Lu Ping took the burden of guilt for Shuo,

317
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,740
Shuo would save him.

318
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,400
It turns out, none of you care if he lives or dies.

319
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:06,460

00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:02,540
Only by beheading the murderer in public can we calm Tan's anger.

477
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:05,040
That was for you, wasn't it?

478
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:09,979
General Qin, you'd really use the same trick again.

479
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:15,859
Brother, you can't take him with you.

480
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,959
If it wasn't for your willful and reckless actions to take Lu Ping away,

481
00:38:29,959 --> 00:38:33,500
how could it have turned out like this?

482
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:36,020
If I don't take Lu Ping today,

483
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:40,579
the two countries will go to war and many more people will die.

484
00:38:40,579 --> 00:38:43,900
Qin Sang, when are you going to understand

485
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:47,640
the responsibility to the people and to the country?

486
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,820
- Wen Rui, prepare to search the mountain.
- Wait!

487
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:57,000
Brother, I understand the general principle

488
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,180
but I also know your faith should not be exchanged

489
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:03,639
for the sacrifice of innocent people.

490
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:07,820
Take Miss away so that she doesn't cause any more trouble!

491
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:11,480
General Qin,

492
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:17,200
I am willing to go back with you.

493
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,220
When I turned myself in at the lodging that day,

494
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:26,680
I was already prepared for the outcome.

495
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:30,399
I got a few more days so I am satisfied.

496
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,160
How could you come out? You can't go with my brother.

497
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:41,120
In the future, don't just lock the door, but also the windows.

498
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,260
Lu Ping!

499
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:48,320
Master, isn't Guo Youdao the best at demanding a life for a life.

500
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,860
I am stronger than him.

501
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:53,460
Lu Ping, you don't have to.

502
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:58,400
You are one of us at the Big Dipper, therefore, the Big Dipper will keep you safe.

503
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,540
Since the Wind Takers were destroyed,

504
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:03,559
I thought I would have no root and no home.

505
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,640
That I would wander for the rest of my life.

506
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,559
But I didn't find my place of peace,

507
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,960
until master rescued me and brought me to the Big Dipper.

508
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:17,920
So, I won't let the Big Dipper end in the same way.

509
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:32,000
General Qin, I am going with you.

510
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,280
Can I talk to your sister before I go?

511
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,640
What's wrong?

512
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:07,060
It's just one slap from your brother, why are you so angry?

513
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,759
I am upset with myself.

514
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:13,000
I wanted to save your life but I still cost you your life.

515
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,440
Silly girl!

516
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,600
You didn't mess up.

517
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,880
It's all my own decision.

518
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,460
But there's one thing I can't be rest assured of.

519
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:29,100
Now, it seems that I can only entrust it to you.

520
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,900
What is there to entrust? Entrust to who?

521
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:34,039
What unfinished business do you have? Go and do it yourself!

522
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,540
It's not like I'm saying my last wishes.

523
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:38,960
I am talking about Su Tang.

524
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,359
She is under the control of Xu Weifeng.

525
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:45,540
Find and save her for me.

526
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:48,539
How about you? What are you going to do?

527
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,760
Don't worry!

528
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,460
I am the bandit.

529
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:00,880
No one's allowed to just take my life.

530
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,619
Go and save Su Tang for me

531
00:42:03,619 --> 00:42:07,080
so that I can be more at ease to save myself.

532
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,980
Okay?

533
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:11,919
Okay, I promise you.

534
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,160
Young Master Lu.

535
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:28,299
Young Master Lu, Miss,

536
00:42:28,299 --> 00:42:31,480
I'd like to go with you to rescue Miss Su Tang.

537
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,980
I will do everything I can.

538
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:36,559
Ziyan, you...

539
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:41,580
You've both have taken care of me.

540
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:44,260
I regard you as my family.

541
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,540
Young Master Lu, if you still regard me as a friend,

542
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:50,480
don't keep me out of this.

543
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:55,020
That works! The more people, the more assurance.

544
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,200
Okay.

545
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:02,240
Then I entrust Su Tang's life to both of you.

546
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:24,500

♫ Waiting to be buried by the lake in the town, ♫

548
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:36,740
♫ the White Paper Boat drifting with sorrow. ♫

♫ Lights on the other side of the sea ♫

550

♫ punched fingertips in the red water tower. ♫

551
00:43:55,290 --> 00:44:00,630
♫ Watch the little boat churning, laughing at the ordinariness. ♫

552
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:04,890
♫ Like a kite being pulled into a low altitude, ♫

553
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:10,430
♫ I smiled to the leaving person. ♫

554
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:14,690
♫ The more spotlight, the more vivid the story. ♫

555
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:19,640
♫ Laughing like the moon, ♫

556

♫ regretting the lighthouse broke in the waves, ♫

557
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:31,510
♫ I call the Milky Way that isolates us all, blue. ♫

558
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:38,850
♫ Like a moat built under the sea, ♫

559
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:43,630
♫ waiting for the words on the paper boat to disappear, ♫

560
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:50,710
♫ there must always be someone who doesn’t remember listening to the other. ♫

561

♫ Anyone who is correctly guessed will end in disfavor. ♫

562
00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:02,450
♫ You are particularly touched but others consider it ordinary. ♫

563
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:07,820
♫ Like the author, roughly put down with a weak stroke, ♫

564

♫ Can a moat be built on the seabed? ♫

569

♫ Wipe all the words on the paper boat! ♫
