00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,910
♫ The dark green sea is hazy ♫

3
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:32,710
♫ dissipating in a flash ♫

4
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:36,590
♫ Rivers and lakes divide the world ♫

5
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:39,890
♫ Ten thousands arrows are firing at once ♫

6
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:43,940
♫ Who has time to worry? Who loves the color of blood? ♫

7
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:47,790
♫ At that time, spirits are high ♫

8
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:51,720
♫ Who calls the world his home? Who dares let his horse freely run? ♫

9
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,300
♫ Silently, tears form in the death of night ♫

10
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,230
♫ Heroes are cutting all ties, ♫

11
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,030
♫ giving up whether it's life or death, ♫

12
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:04,240
♫ never asking what the cost is ♫

13
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:09,780
♫ Good and evil must be distinguished ♫

14
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,740
♫ The wind blows off the snow ♫

15
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,560
♫ On the body, etch multiple scars, ♫

16
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,750
♫ wandering all over the world, ♫

17
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:25,150
♫ only wish to ask for answers from this world ♫

18
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:29,190
♫ A teenager doesn't have to be a hero ♫

19
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:33,050
♫ There is no need for flowers in the dream ♫

20
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:35,120
♫ Destiny need not be afraid ♫

21
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:40,640
♫ Because you have him all the way, ♫

22
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,750
♫ experienced a handful of conquests, ♫

23
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:48,530
♫ overcame a number of challenges ♫

24
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:50,660
♫ From now on, happy and free! ♫

25
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:56,070
♫ The only wish is, with the world, ♫

26
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:00,670

29
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:29,240
I waited for you here today in order to make up for my mistakes.

30
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,840
Today, I promise to receive three moves of yours.

31
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,299
I will leave my life to fate.

32
00:02:34,299 --> 00:02:38,000
Please forget your hatred after three moves

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,920
and cooperate with the Wuji Manor against Liu Song.

34
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,400
I will avenge all my old and new grudges

35

37
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,340
Something's not right.

38
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,740
What exactly is off?

39
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,880
Why doesn't he fight back?

40
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,700
Yan Qiuci,

41
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,040
what did you do?

42
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,739
You have one more move.

43
00:03:53,739 --> 00:03:56,800
It's your last chance.

44
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,640
Lu Ping.

45
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,920
Lu Ping, stop.

46
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,060
Lu Ping,

47
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,780
Father is waiting for you inside the manor.

48
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,000
I will entrust the battle against

49
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,640
the Mountain and Sea Gang to you.

50
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,580
You imposed the Broken Marks on me at that time.

51
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,739
- Senior Eldest Brother.
- Lu Ping.

52
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,000
Do you still remember your question?

53
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,000
If you were the one who had to sacrifice himself,

54
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,940
would I kill you?

55
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,640
My answer has never changed.

56
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,240
I would never give up

57
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,300
anyone in the Wind Taker Academy.

58
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,600
No exceptions.

59
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,120
So you planned all of this.

60
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,559
You emptied the Wuji Manor.

61
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,839
You found an excuse to send away the Agile Dragon Army.

62
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,620
Ever since I walked into Wuji Manor,

63
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,999
you had decided to die by my hands.

64
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,720
I was never able to persuade you.

65
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,720
Isn't that right?

66
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:13,260
If the past hatred requires a life as repayment,

67
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,759
then use mine.

68
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,260
Yan Qiuci was the one who did it!

69
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,980
While at the Wind Taker Academy,

70
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,440
you were talking about integrity all the time.

71
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:28,220
Can't you distinguish right from wrong, right now?

72
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,960
You are the son of your parents.

73
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,800
So am I.

74
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:38,440
Who doesn't want their family to live well?

75
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,520
I've behaved myself for my whole life.

76
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,120
Treat this as my last wish, to be selfish for once.

77
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,400
You are quite skilled to be able to withstand this.

78
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:30,919
I've sealed your acupuncture points with silver needles to temporarily inhibit the cold toxin,

79
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:36,160
but you have to remember that no matter what happens, you can't use the Pneuma of Strength.

80
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,880
Otherwise,

81
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,479
it will only accelerate the spread of the toxin in your body.

82
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:45,520
If the blood you spit out turns completely black, even if there's an antidote at that time,

83
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,420
it won't work.

84
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,420
Don't tell anyone about this,

85
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:57,200
including Su Tang and Lu Ping.

86
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,079
I have saved your life.

87
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:02,600
Why should I obey your request?

88
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,840
Do you need me to kneel down and beg you?

89
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,920
Forget it.

90
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,980
You are all stubborn.

91
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,080
I promise you, okay?

92
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,580
It's just that what should we do now?

93
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,520
Let's go to Wuji Manor.

94
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,600
Hopefully, we can still make it in time to stop everything.

95
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,640
It's already been so long.

96
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,360
It's so dark now.

97
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,219
Not just the revenge, I'm afraid it's been long enough to kill everyone.

98
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:40,240
Xifan is there.

99
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,800
He is the only one who can calm Lu Ping down now.

100
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,140
If we get there in time,

101
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,220
we may still be able to persuade Lu Ping.

102
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,500
This is the smell of the Mountain and Sea Gang.

103
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,160
Is it heading for Wuji Manor?

104
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,380
I think it is heading for us.

105
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,179
This is bad.

106
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:08,120
They are here for Su Tang.

107
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,660
They are coming for Lu Chenfeng.

Su Tang!

109
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,580
Were you hurt anywhere?

110
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,879
Princess, the Mountain and Sea Gang just came.

111
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:30,280
When we arrived, Su Tang was the only one left.

112
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,419
Master, what exactly happened?

113
00:09:34,419 --> 00:09:37,879
Say something. Don't scare me, Master.

114
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,159
Did they take Lu Chenfeng?

115
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,700
He followed them voluntarily.

116
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:46,900
He said... he wanted to meet Senior Song.

Wen Rui,

118
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,999
order the entire Agile Dragon Army to return to Wuji Manor.

The swords have been drawn and the bows have been stretched.

Yes.

122
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,160
Perhaps, I should thank Zhai Rong.

123
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,220
If it wasn't for His Majesty in granting this marriage, all these years

124
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:23,200
I would never have been able to guess that Senior Yan was the man behind it all.

125
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,960
He might be able to be the last one hiding, but that doesn't mean he'll be the last one laughing.

This is great. You are actually still alive.

131

I didn't know you were still alive. I didn't search for you in time,

00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,880
but we have reunited now.

133

Do you still remember the man who killed our elder brother

134

and forced us to become like this?

00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,359
Dan State is in danger.

327
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:58,480
As a prince of Dan State, I need to seek interests for my own country.

328
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,860
You ignored the life of a half-year-old child.

329
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:04,420
How can you talk about the country and justice?

330
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:10,440
Today, I was caught by you.

331
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:15,640
I have nothing to say. If you want to kill and hurt me, do as you please.

332
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,000
I can forgive you,

333
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:24,760
but Big Dipper's principle of never interfering with politics has never changed.

334
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:28,000
Right now, you have two paths you can take.

335
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,899
One, immediately leave the mountain and continue to be a prince of Dan State.

336
00:33:32,899 --> 00:33:36,960
However, you will have nothing to do with Big Dipper from now on.

337
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,690
- How about the second?
- Second,

338
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:44,980
stay at Big Dipper. From now on, there will no longer be the prince, Liu Song.

339
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:47,420
You are just Little Six of Tianji Peak.

340
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:52,300
From now on, Big Dipper will be by your side.

341
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:57,380
Also, you should hand over the Thousand Pine Ruler and the commander's seal

342
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:59,820
to prove your determination.

343
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,060
Follow me.

344
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,560
Have you decided?

345
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,600
From today on,

346
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,140
I am just Little Six of Big Dipper.

347
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:40,000
Are you staying because of Chu Min?

348
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,980
Yes and no.

349
00:34:44,819 --> 00:34:46,260
I grew up in the palace.

350
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:49,380
I have seen people competing and scheming since I was young.

351
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,919
I even came to Big Dipper

352
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:54,720
in order to get ahead of my other family members.

353
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,839
Big Dipper is different. There is only martial arts here.

354
00:34:58,839 --> 00:35:02,480
It is pure and peaceful. I am very happy here.

355
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,620
I want to continue staying here and calling you my elder brother.

356
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:18,600
- Little Seven.
- Elder Brother.

357
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,979
Little Seven, seal this Thousand Pine Ruler

358
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:25,720
for your senior Song.

359
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,879
Leave it... in the Seven Martyr Court.

360
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,980
Yes, Elder Brother.

361
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:32,680
Senior Song,

362
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:36,040
this is a new sword that elder brother asked me to forge for you.

363
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,760
This…

364
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,880
To remote from life. To eliminate ambition. To stay away from war.

365
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:49,540
However, there is one thing you can't stay away from.

366
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:52,360
Little Six, starting today,

367
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:56,720
the entire Big Dipper is behind you.

368
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:00,920
Since then, I made up my mind to forget the past.

369
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,600
I was only a disciple of Big Dipper,

370
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,080
but I never would have thought it would only be for a short period of time.

371
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,900
I don't know how Yan Qiuci found out my secret.

372
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:12,560
He secretly colluded with Zhai Rong and led those thieves in.

373
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,340
How could that happen?

374
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,720
How come Uncle Lu never mentioned that to me?

375
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:21,320
Little Seven has always been naive. What about you?

376
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:25,620
You've never doubted why His Majesty kept stopping you,

377
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:28,040
but was always concealing something?

378
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:31,260
Why is it that he's clearly from the imperial court,

379
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:36,180
but wasn't surprised at all of your identity as the Awakener?

380
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,880
Lu Ping,

381
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:48,920
your existence is all part of his and Yan Qiuci's plan.

382
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,600
Your Highness, hand out the commander's seal.

383
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,020
Elder Brother.

384
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:30,360
I heard Master Leng never interfered with politics.

385
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:33,740
As long as Liu Song hands over the commander's seal, we will not interfere with each other.

386
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:36,340
Liu Song is the disciple of Big Dipper.

387
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:38,480
He has nothing to do with the imperial court.

388
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,279
As the master of the Big Dipper,

389
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,820
I don't allow people to come here and cause trouble.

390
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,800
Come.

391
00:37:56,370 --> 00:38:00,020
[Seven Martyr Court]

392
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:04,559
Back then, in order to restrain the six pneumas within you, your father and mother

393
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,320
used up 70% of their cultivation.

394
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:10,800
However, they still saved me without any hesitation.

395
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,600
We went back to Seven Martyr Court that day.

396
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:16,360
Your mother saw that I was injured.

397
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:19,920
She pushed me and you into a secret room.

398
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,799
Little Six, I will leave Ping'er to you.

399
00:38:25,799 --> 00:38:28,680
- Sister-in-Law.
- Your elder brother promised to protect you.

400
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,960
I will alongside him.

401
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:53,360
I didn't expect that when the door closed,

402
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,100
it would be a farewell.

403
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:01,340
They died so miserably.

404
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:05,140
Elder Brother was stabbed multiple times, dying with many grievances.

405
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:08,560
Your mother was killed in one strike

406
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,500
in order to save us.

407
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,740
In order to save us.

408
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,439
Finally, Yan Qiuci wanted to force me to come out,

409
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:26,820
so he set the Seven Martyr Court on fire.

410
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,750
[Seven Martyr Court]

411
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:12,660
Elder Brother!

412
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,399
I stayed for a long time in the fire.

413
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:38,380
I thought about being burned to death with you, Elder Brother and Sister-in-Law in the Seven Martyr Court.

414
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:40,440
Then everything would be over.

415
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,060
However, Elder Brother once said, there is no value in dying

416
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:48,620
without saving something.

417
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,440
I want to take revenge.

418
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,560
I had to live on.

419
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:59,080
[Seven Martyr Court]

420
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:45,460
Your Highness! Your Highness!

421
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:47,800
I am sorry that I came late to your rescue.

422
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:58,140
Do you know why we are called the Mountain and Sea Gang?

423
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:02,920
It is to tell those people that their sins

424
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,200
will not disappear.
