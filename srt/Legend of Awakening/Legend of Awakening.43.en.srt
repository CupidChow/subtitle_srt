00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,930
♫ The dark green sea is hazy ♫

3
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:32,860
♫ dissipating in a flash ♫

4
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:36,670
♫ Rivers and lakes divide the world ♫

5
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,970
♫ Ten thousands arrows are firing at once ♫

6
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:43,980
♫ Who has time to worry? Who loves the color of blood? ♫

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,770
♫ At that time, spirits are high ♫

8
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:51,640
♫ Who calls the world his home?
Who dares let his horse freely run? ♫

9
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,280
♫ Silently, tears form in the death of night ♫

10
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,220
♫ Heroes are cutting all ties, ♫

11
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:02,060
♫ giving up whether it's life or death, ♫

12
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,200
♫ never asking what the cost is ♫

13
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:09,850
♫ Good and evil must be distinguished ♫

14
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:13,750
♫ The wind blows off the snow ♫

15
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:17,630
♫ On the body, etch multiple scars, ♫

16
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:19,750
♫ wandering all over the world, ♫

17
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:25,200
♫ only wish to ask for answers from this world ♫

18
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,200
♫ A teenager doesn't have to be a hero ♫

19
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,100
♫ There is no need for flowers in the dream ♫

20
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,290
♫ Destiny need not be afraid ♫

21

[Episode 43]

29
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,860
General.

30
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,299
I'm Yan Xifan, a general conferred by His Majesty. Reporting for duty.

31
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:41,840
He's just a homeless cur from Wuji Manor.

32
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,940
What could he possibly do?

33
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:50,340
The most dangerous time is right before a man starts to take initiative.

34
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,120
He is not someone we can look down upon.
[Mountain and Sea Map]

35
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,700
Since ancient times, heroes have always emerged from the younger generation.

36
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:59,480
If he had been born in Dan, I would've put him in an important position.

37
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,700
It's just a pity that he's loyal to Zhai Rong.

38
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,040
He is doomed to be a victim.

39
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:08,740
Although Wuji Manor has been defeated, the country of Shuo is still powerful.

40
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:11,760
The battle of Jin City will be a tough one.

41
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,860
Teacher,

42
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,640
you and the Dan Army will set out overnight for Jin City.

43
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,260
I will obey.

44
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,840
Master, you are priceless. If you want to go to the front line,

45
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,000
I am willing to follow and take care of you.

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,860
Keeping you here is more useful.

47
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,140
We haven't finished building the army of Force Eaters.

48
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:38,080
The blood taken from Lu Ping is already enough.

49
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,220
The most important thing now is to complete the creation of the Force Eaters.

50
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:46,900
Once we've succeeded, even if Shuo has thousands of troops,

51
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,600
they'll only be like ants to us.

52
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,460
Yes.

53

[Mountain and Sea Map]

54
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,360
Father,

55
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,560
the ancestors of the Liu family have held the Central Plains for generations.

56
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,420
It won't be long

57
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,620
before we can go back.

58
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,620
Miss Ling.

59
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,640
It's my turn to keep watch. Go and get some rest.

60
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,560
About Lu Ping…

61
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,840
We still haven't found him yet.

62
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,720
Tomorrow is the day His Majesty will assemble the troops and take his oath before them.

63
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,560
It's also the best time for Lu Ping to make his move.

64
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,719
The Dragon Agile Army will take all the necessary steps to protect his life.

65
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,000
We will fight to the death to defend His Majesty.

66
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,120
Don't worry, Miss Ling.

67
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,560
Thank you, General Wen.

68
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,460
Hurry, go get some rest.

69
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,520
Which camp are you from?

70
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,800
I am talking to you.

71
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,760
Miss, I didn't know you were going personally to inspect it.

72
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,660
Please forgive me.

73
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:47,920
Tomorrow matters are important. Have all the arrangements for guarding His Majesty been made?

74
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,679
Yes. The guards are resting right behind the camp.

75
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,340
Turns out the pneuma of essence is extraordinarily useful.

76
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,620
When I was young,

77
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:44,080
I followed my father to fight against tyranny.

78
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,700
Today, all of the great lands of Shuo,

79
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:51,280
is what I and all of you officers and soldiers before me,

80
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,820
fought to build with our own hands and blood.

81
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,419
Long Live Your Majesty! Long Live Shuo!

82
00:06:57,419 --> 00:07:00,099
Long Live Your Majesty! Long Live Shuo!

83
00:07:00,099 --> 00:07:03,880
Long Live Your Majesty! Long Live Shuo!

84
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:08,560
Today, the country of Dan hasn't learned from the past.

85
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,000
It colludes with Jianghu forces to invade our borders.

86
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,700
I will personally go into battle.

87
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,520
I will let them know,

88
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,920
what we have built,

89
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,300
we can keep!

90
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,180
Victory for Shuo!

91
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,540
Victory for Shuo!

00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:35,740
Victory for Shuo!

93
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:40,340
Victory for Shuo!

Victory for Shuo!

97
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,199
Forward army, move to the back! Rear army, move to the front!

98
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,800
Instead of the second battalion, the first battalion will escort His Majesty back to the palace!

99
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,500
Yes, Sir!

100
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,520
Why would Zhai Rong change the escort for no reason?

101
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:53,340
Zhai Rong, there is no use even if you change the guards.

102
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,560
Today, no one can save you.

103
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:02,400
It's Lu Ping. Lu Ping's here.

104
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,540
Protect His Majesty, retreat!

105
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,600
Protect His Majesty!

106
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,340
Qin Sang.

107
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,040
Why is it you?

108
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,360
Lu Ping, you and His Majesty could have been one.

109
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,179
It didn't have to be this way. Don't be fooled by Liu Song.

110
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,960
Lu Ping,

111
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:04,980
you have cultivated a high level of skill. You should have had a higher purpose.

112
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:11,240
Your parents are heroes. If they were still alive,

113
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:16,220
they would definitely tell you to consider the overall situation and serve the country and the people.

114
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,200
You are not my parents.

115
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,600
How would you know they would be willing to make sacrifices for the overall situation?

116
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,420
They never wanted to get involved in politics,

117
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,280
and they still became the victims in your struggle for power.

118
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,940
And Mo Lin,

119
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,600
he was just about to get married.

120
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,140
Lu Ping.

121
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:51,960
Zhai Rong, I am the son of my parents; the brother of my friends.

122
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,520
Since it's hard to achieve both loyalty and filial piety,

123
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,440
I have to make a decision today.

124
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:43,780
You already heard news of Xifan a few days ago and you're just now getting here?!

125
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,399
If this is how much you've practiced the Pneuma of Energy,

126
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,820
don't let anyone know you're my disciple.

127
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:55,859
Yes. Yes. Yes. As long as I can see Sangsang, you're right about everything.

128
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:01,219
Master, you don't have to wait for me. I can keep up.

129
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:07,980
Didn't you see the movement of the troops outside the city gate?

130
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,620
Is that because of Lu Ping?

131
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,140
Qin Sang, are you going to protect this murderer?

132
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:27,479
Lu Ping, since the event at Seven Stars,

133
00:12:27,479 --> 00:12:31,979
Liu Song has used the Mountain and Sea Gang to disturb the world and hurt the martial arts circles.

134
00:12:31,979 --> 00:12:35,180
You're suffering from it yourself.

135
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:40,700
Lu Ping, you have to understand that I forced you because I'm afraid you'll cause more trouble.

136
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:46,860
Put your weapon down.

137
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:50,100
The one you want isn't me.

138
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:54,539
The Liu Family of Hedong are known for their foolishness. The first emperor took his place by following the will of Heaven.

139
00:12:54,539 --> 00:12:58,859
His Majesty has carried out the new deal and strengthened the nation. He is a blessing for the people.

140
00:12:58,859 --> 00:13:04,119
Because of his own selfish desires, Liu Song is tormenting the border stations.

141
00:13:04,119 --> 00:13:06,260
Disregarding anything else, His Majesty is personally leading the troops to save the people from suffering.

142
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:11,520
If you insist on assassinating him today, the world will be thrown into chaos.

143
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:20,560
As a Minister of Shuo, I have to stop you today.

144
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,540
But I know your pain the best. If I can pacify the hatred in your heart,

145
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,720
I am willing to die and make amends for His Majesty.

146
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,100
Miss.

147
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:47,280
I had thought you would stand with me,

148
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,320
but turns out you're the same as them.

149
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:02,000
No. Someone loves you.

150
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,600
Life or death, right or wrong,

151
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,000
I will always accompany you.

152
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,680
After the war subsides,

153
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,640
let's go somewhere beautiful

154
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,380
and live a life like ordinary people.

155
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,400
Isn't that what you've always wanted?

156
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:33,780
If there's a war, you'll never realize what you wish for then.

157
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:40,960
So promise me. Let it go.

♫ Wipe all the words on the paper boat ♫

159
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:53,200

It's bad.

174
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:37,460
He made up his mind to break the sixth lock.

175
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:40,540
Now he can't stand the power of the six pneumas.

176
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:44,700
His energy is in chaos and his meridians are damaged.

Elder Guo, please. Save him.

I've temporarily stabilized his injury for now. Help him back, then we'll see.

No need to follow. If he's dying,

there's no point in continuing to engage with him.

183

[Qin Family]

186

Elder Guo, how is he?

187
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:53,320
That year, his parents, Leng Xiutan and Shao Yinchu,

188
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,420
in order to save their young son's life,

189
00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:01,740
they spent half a lifetime's worth of skills to put the pneuma confinement on him.

190
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:07,160
I never thought he'd be able to break the confinement.

191
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:11,580
The six pneumas have collided. Once the body is exhausted,

192
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,040
he will die.

193
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,460
You have to save him.

194
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:23,180
I am willing to pay any price.

195
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:28,059
Sangsang, he's seeking his own death. Why do you have to treat him so well?

196
00:18:28,059 --> 00:18:30,860
Even Wuyou Valley couldn't save his life.

197
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,700
I can only temporarily stabilize his heart meridian for a while.

198
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:41,380
I can only protect it for a moment. I still can't save his life.

204
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:22,640
Sangsang, haven't you always regarded him as your life? Are you really willing to let him die?

205
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,620
Since his chance of surviving is slim, compared to dying like this,

206
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:32,020
I can't bear that in his last moments of life,

207
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:35,420
knowing he never got to live the life he wanted.

208

If you've decided, then you can't regret it.

What he wants most

211
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,400
in his life is the life of an ordinary person.

212
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,060
But he was born with a father's debt of revenge

213
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:00,600
and all kinds of emotions.

214
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,720
Never for a single day did he get to live his life for himself.

215
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:11,920
I want him to live without restraint. Every day counts.

216
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:18,040
No matter what decision he makes,

217
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,820
I will follow him.

218
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:28,100
In that case, send him back to Big Dipper.

219
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:33,440
In case there are any accidents, he can also be taken care of.

Resign?

221
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:14,980
I am going to fight with Dan and the Mountain and Sea Gang.

222
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:20,159
And this time I'm going in person. You're telling me you want to resign right now?!

223
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:24,659
Now that the Agile Dragon Army is well-trained, it also has General Wen and Xifan to assist.

224
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:29,779
It will be the most powerful guardian of Shuo. I am no longer important.

Qin Sang, do you still remember what you promised Qin Qi?

228
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:49,240
I remember. I was desperate to stop Lu Ping that day.

229
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:53,360
After my brother passed, I've been alone.

230
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,340
Lu Ping is the only one I care about.

231
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:02,920
Now he is dying. We don't have a whole life to spend together anymore.

232
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:07,800
I hope in the rest of the life he has left, we can keep each other company;

233
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,960
live and die together.

234
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:18,580
Your Majesty, Lu Ping suffered his entire life because of Shuo.

235
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:23,520
I dare not complain and I will defend Shuo to the death.

236
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:28,940
The only thing I want is to stay with him while he is dying.

237
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:35,400
To ease his loneliness. I hope Your Majesty can be compassionate in this.

238
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,420
Qin Sang...

239

I don't want to see you anymore.

241
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,200
I just knew My Lady would come.

242
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,880
You don't need to call me "Lady" from now on.

243
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,979
Congratulations, you've finally got what you wanted.

244

You are the true General of Agile Dragon Army.

245
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:30,860
I, as the Lady of the Qin Family, can't be compared with you.

246
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:34,579
No. You are still much stronger than I am.

247
00:24:34,579 --> 00:24:40,220
All I did was for myself. You've sacrificed much more.

248
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:44,360
But everyone has his own way to go. I won't compare myself with you anymore.

249
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:50,339
From now on, the responsibility of loyalty to the emperor and the country is now on you and Xifan.

250
00:24:50,339 --> 00:24:54,879
It's cruel on the battlefield. Take care of yourselves.

251
00:24:54,879 --> 00:24:58,460
As for Wen Rui, help me to persuade him.

252
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:03,119
After my brother and I left him, it's been hard for him.

253
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:08,119
He is the mainstay of the army. You and Xifan will need him.

254
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:12,060
You can rest assured, Xifan and I will pay attention to him.

255
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:20,780
You and Xifan, how are you two?

256
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,280
When I would study with you as a child,

257
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:28,000
there was a saying that would confuse me, "One day apart seems like three years."

258
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,779
Without him here these past few days, I've finally understood the meaning of the saying.

259
00:25:31,779 --> 00:25:35,780
I wish I could ignore everything and set my horse out to meet him.

260
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:45,520
Miss, Lu Ping, is he all right?

261
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:50,420
He is fine.

262
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:55,419
He and I will go to a quiet and beautiful place to enjoy a few days of leisure.

Lu Ping and you are the most important people in my life.

265
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:10,020
I hope you can protect each other and never be apart.

266
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:01,780
Master, we've done it.

267
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:18,420
I knew it. Lu Ping couldn't kill Zhai.

268
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:20,000
All I wanted was

269
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:25,340
for him to break the last lock on the pneuma confinement.

270
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:30,380
Create a true Force Eater with six pneumas for me.

271
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:35,240
I was unable to unlock the sixth lock on Lu Ping's confinement before,

272
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,959
leading to his blood being blocked so he couldn't use his entire ability.

273
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:43,980
Who knew he'd break the lock and leave me his blood for my research.

274
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:48,700
If this blood can be used as a medicine, it may stop their festering.

275
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:52,360
Help them withstand the power of six pneumas so you can use them.

276
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:56,199
It's just that the power of six pneumas is too strong.

277
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,500
I'm afraid the odds of success are only about half.

278
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:11,920
I'm willing to use my life to test the blood for the master.

279
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:19,520
I was hurt by Lu Ping, I am willing to try with my life.

280
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,939
Master, congratulations. If one person was successful, we can make that ten and from ten to a hundred.

281
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:37,260
You will have an invincible army of Force Eaters.

282
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:41,440
No one will dare stop you.

283
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:47,420
The one who helped me solve my problems was still you, Lu Ping.

284
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,680

287
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:16,140
you also failed to reach a state where you could use all six pneumas.

288
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,900
Lu Ping is the awakening.

289
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:23,410
He could only keep his life through the pneuma confinement.

I have lived my life miserably for years,

To succeed or die trying.

316
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:38,160
The worst would be to become like her.

317
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,220
All I can do is leave here.

318
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:46,859
I would rather kill myself before I go crazy living through dark days here.

319
00:32:46,859 --> 00:32:51,400
You would rather die than stay here.

320
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,570
Are there really no old feelings left

321
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,999
between you and me?

322
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,500
Then even more so you should let me go!

323
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:03,460
To make me believe that you still have a trace of sincerity

324
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:06,220
from the past and our relationship.

325
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,780
Let her go.

326
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,919
Master, don't be fooled by her.

327
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:29,639
You and I are the only ones left from the seven masters of the Big Dipper back then.

328
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,500
I don't want to lose you.

329
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:35,080
On the day you've finally thought it through,

330
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:40,240
I'll personally come and get you.

331
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:46,000
That day will never come.

332
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:05,740
I've already sent someone to follow her.

333
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:09,850
But if Chu Min takes the blood snake somewhere she shouldn't,

334
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:11,880
I'm afraid something will happen.

335
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:18,879
It has been so many years. She always says she's changed,

336
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:22,479
but Chu Min is still Chu Min.

337
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:28,739
What she wants is nothing more than a way to seek a way to stop the Force Eaters.

338
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:31,370
So there's only one possibility.

339
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:33,540
Carefree Valley?

340
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,400
Carefree Valley is hard to find.

341
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:44,359
It always brings trouble. If she's willing to lead the way,

342
00:34:44,359 --> 00:34:46,260
how can I let her down?

343
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:48,450
In this case,

344
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:52,430
I'll use it as a testing ground for the Force Eaters.

345
00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:56,480
Use the blood of Carefree Valley to test them for the war

346
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,100
and help me win the battle.

347
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:02,780
- But Chu Min…
- Don't try to guess what's on my mind.

348
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:14,390
Whether I'm sincere about her or not,

349
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,870
it's none of your business.

350
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,540
Yes, Sir.

351
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:58,710
I'm afraid that the blood of these Force Eaters Xifan sent us won't help much.

352
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:02,119
If I'm unable to figure out the theory of the Mountain and Sea Gang's Xi Sui,

353
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:05,060
I won't be able to figure out how to make this antidote.

354
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:14,220
I may not be able to realize Mo Lin's dream then.

355
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:17,359
Help! It's bleeding! Help! It's bleeding!

356
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:18,499
Girl, what's happened?

357
00:37:18,499 --> 00:37:19,719
It's fine, it's fine.

358
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,879
Are you sure?

359
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,720
Really, I'm fine.

360
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:26,699
I say, girl, why do you bother suffering along with this old man?

361
00:37:26,699 --> 00:37:30,179
You and Mo Lin didn't get married.

362
00:37:30,179 --> 00:37:32,139
You don't need to do this.

363
00:37:32,139 --> 00:37:35,259
We made a promise. I am his wife.

364
00:37:35,259 --> 00:37:38,479
Since he isn't here anymore, I have to be filial for him.

365
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:42,079
Why bother?

366
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,220
This is the path I chose.

367
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,660
I don't feel like it's a struggle.

368
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:49,400
All I knew before was to follow my brother.

369
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:53,160
I had thought it would be for a lifetime.

370
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:56,020
Mo Lin offered me a new choice.

371
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:58,420
I made my choice.

372
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:01,160
I don't have a habit of giving up halfway.

373
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,219
Fine. Fine, fine.

374
00:38:04,219 --> 00:38:07,839
In that case, no, you, you, you can stay if you wish.

375
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:10,239
Anyway, the valley can afford another bowl of rice.

376
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:15,020
One day if you get bored being here, I will walk you out.

377
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,040
Mo Lin was right.

378
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:21,639
Master, even though you're crippled and have a strange temperament, but you are kind.

379
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,659
Don't worry. I haven't had a father since I was a kid.

380
00:38:23,659 --> 00:38:25,839
I married Mo Lin. I will take care of you and carry out funerary duties.

381
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:27,820
What? Shush, shush, shush!

382
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:30,119
A child's word carries no harm. (T/N: trying to combat her unlucky words) I don't need you to carry out funerary duties.

383
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:33,459
Can't you bring me some dinner instead? Please.

384
00:38:33,459 --> 00:38:35,620
Hey,

385
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,380
you don't want to look for your brother anymore?

386
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,980
My brother has his road to walk.

387
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:49,359
I'm here with you, trying to find a way to bear the power of six pneumas.

388
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,460
This is what will really help him.

389
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:54,699
Let me know what you need. One, I'm not afraid of hardship; two, I'm not afraid of exhaustion.

390
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:56,380
I will do my best to assist you.

391
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:58,980
Fine, fine.

392
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:01,599
You are the dear wife of my son.

393
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,080
I will do as you wish. Okay?

394
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,200
Young Madam Mo.

395
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,539
We are short of some herbs. I'll go get them.

396
00:39:11,539 --> 00:39:13,460
Fine, fine, fine.

397
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:25,420
This girl... really breaks my heart.

398
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,159
I don't have the Pneuma of Strength.

399
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:42,460
But if I could have a disciple who practices the Pneuma of Strength,

400
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:46,019
that wouldn't be bad. How about I be your master.

Master, the four of them bullied me.
