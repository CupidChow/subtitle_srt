00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,930
♫ The dark green sea is hazy ♫

3
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:32,700
♫ dissipating in a flash. ♫

4
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,570
♫ Rivers and lakes divide the world. ♫

5
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,000
♫ Ten thousands arrows are firing at once. ♫

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,960
♫ Who has time to worry? Who loves the color of blood? ♫

7
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,800
♫ At that time, spirits are high. ♫

8
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,690
♫ Who calls the world his home? Who dares let his horse freely run? ♫

9
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,400
♫ Silently, tears form in the death of night. ♫

10
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,200
♫ Heroes are cutting all ties, ♫

11
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,020
♫ giving up whether it's life or death, ♫

12
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,130
♫ never asking what the cost is. ♫

13
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:09,900
♫ Good and evil must be distinguished. ♫

14
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,820
♫ The wind blows off the snow. ♫

15
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:17,600
♫ On the body, etch multiple scars, ♫

16
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,660
♫ wandering all over the world, ♫

17
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:25,200
♫ only wish to ask for answers from this world. ♫

18
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,260
♫ A teenager doesn't have to be a hero. ♫

19
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:33,100
♫ There is no need for flowers in the dream. ♫

20
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,230
♫ Destiny need not be afraid. ♫

21
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:40,810
♫ Because you have him all the way, ♫

22
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:44,700
♫ experienced a handful of conquests, ♫

23
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,590
♫ overcame a number of challenges. ♫

24
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:50,620
♫ From now on, happy and free! ♫

[Episode 7]

29
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,978
Don't fight! Calm down. Don't fight!

30
00:02:27,978 --> 00:02:32,560
I got it! That brat must have fled to the back of the hillside.

31
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,230
- I'll take you there.
- Hurry up!

32
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,600
- After you!
- Come along!

33
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,879
Over here! This way, please.

34
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,320
Senior Wei, are you sure Lu Ping will come here?

35
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:45,399
I went to great lengths to get this information.

36
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:47,640
That brat always trains at the back of the mountain.

37
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,890
Now, my father came to capture him.

38
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:54,198
The last fight wasn't enough, I want to kill him this time.

39
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:57,500
Senior Wei, someone is really coming from the Wind Taker Institute.

40
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:02,298
Stay hidden and don't make any sound! Once they are near, we'll make our move.

41
00:03:02,298 --> 00:03:03,740
- Yes.
- Yes.

42
00:03:09,419 --> 00:03:10,920
Are you guys ready?

43
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,700
Who did that?

44
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,018
Brat! You didn't succumb to the poison in the tower last time, I'll kill you today!

45
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:57,859
- Tianqi?
- Father, how could it be you?

46
00:03:57,859 --> 00:04:01,959
I... I... I sacrificed myself to save your father.

47
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:03,550
Thank you.

48
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:07,550
- Am I dead? Am I dead?
- No, you're not! You're still living.

49
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:10,900
- What's wrong?
- Why does it not hurt? I don't feel pain anymore.

50
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,320
Hang on, you're...

51
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:17,060
Get up right now.

52
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,660
It's retribution for my sins.

53
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:24,219
I originally wanted you two to lead the attack and capture Lu Ping.

54
00:04:24,219 --> 00:04:26,150
Thank goodness, I walked in front of you.

55
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:30,260
- Otherwise, your son would have...
- Thank you so much.

56
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,999
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

57
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,199
Wei Young Lord, what did you mean just now?

58
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,299
- You used poison inside the tower?
- I didn't!

59
00:04:38,299 --> 00:04:42,059
Cheating in the exam and poisoning the lives of other test takers.

60
00:04:42,059 --> 00:04:43,920
What kind of crime is this?

61
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,680
Tianqi, don't be afraid!

62
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,299
My son would never do such a despicable act.

63
00:04:50,299 --> 00:04:55,358
It was so chaotic just now, maybe you heard it wrongly.

64
00:04:55,358 --> 00:04:58,179
- All of us heard it.
- Your son did it.

65
00:04:58,179 --> 00:05:01,278
Yes! You guys heard it wrongly!

66
00:05:01,278 --> 00:05:04,219
- You guys heard it wrongly; everyone heard it wrongly!
- Yes, they heard it wrongly.

67
00:05:04,219 --> 00:05:06,998
We heard it, Master. We swear!

68
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:10,720
Actually, I heard it, too.

69
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,379
You... How could you?

70
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:15,410
Come over here!

71
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:20,419
Well, I need a bit of hush money.

72
00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:24,030
We, Wind Taker Institute, isn't as wealthy as that Chan State Academy.

73
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:28,119
We don't accept payment on credit. Cash! Cash is accepted.

74
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:33,960
Guo Youdao, this is blackmail! You're blackmailing me.

75
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:43,959
They are gone! Every single person from the Wei family has left.

76
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:47,119
I told you! My luck is back again.

77
00:05:47,119 --> 00:05:49,820
- Really?
- Of course!

78
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,400
Brother, they left and we're fine now.

79
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,739
Can we still go back?

80
00:06:05,739 --> 00:06:08,858
I already said those things, going back is embarrassing.

81
00:06:11,179 --> 00:06:13,879
Let's go! Let's wait for him at Ruyu House.

82
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:15,700
Whom are we waiting for?

83
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:19,080
After he arrives, you'll know.

84
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,940
Master,

85
00:06:34,739 --> 00:06:37,060
why did you protect Lu Ping so desperately?

86
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,530
You even pretended to be a bad person.

87
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:45,039
No wonder Lu Ping always provokes you.

88
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:49,239
Now, I also feel that your personality

89
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,600
is quite interesting.

90
00:07:07,859 --> 00:07:09,920
Come with me!

91
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,360
[Ruyu House]

92
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,339
From now on,

93
00:07:25,339 --> 00:07:30,700
you have nothing to do with the Wind Taker Institute.

94
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:35,600
Cutting ties with them is the only way to save them from all this mess.

95
00:07:36,939 --> 00:07:39,700
Brother, he really came.

96
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,820
Save me!

97
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,340
Mo Lin, Su Tang is your disciple and also my disciple.

98
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,779
If I die, I'll never let her take you as her master.

99
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:53,660
Speak now if you have something to say.

100
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:56,290
You guys can either fight now or get this done with.

101
00:07:56,298 --> 00:07:58,739
Old geezer, I'm going to kill you.

102
00:07:59,499 --> 00:08:03,218
Master, is this why you wanted me to come with you?

103
00:08:03,218 --> 00:08:06,498
Old geezer, I won't let you die instantly.

104
00:08:06,498 --> 00:08:11,319
The Piebald Scorpion Venom on this arrow will make you itch for seven weeks straight.

105
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:15,719
Despicable person! Come here if you dare...

106
00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:17,859
to fight with Xifan.

107
00:08:17,859 --> 00:08:19,499
Let go of Xifan if you dare.

108
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,219
I'll never let him go! Lu Ping, come here.

109
00:08:22,219 --> 00:08:25,078
Perfect timing! Make that brat stop right now.

110
00:08:25,078 --> 00:08:26,879
Am I not rat poop?

111
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,339
Assumed I farted loudly that day, can you?

112
00:08:30,339 --> 00:08:32,260
Please don't, Master!

113
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,560
Although I'm petty,

114
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,010
I really want to talk to you, openly and honestly,

115
00:08:38,619 --> 00:08:41,250
so that you can understand me.

116
00:08:44,939 --> 00:08:49,200
Madam Jin, prepare some dishes and wine.

117
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,159
Put it on my tab.

118
00:08:51,979 --> 00:08:53,679
All right.

119
00:08:55,859 --> 00:08:57,599
Shi Dongchun wine?

120
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:03,170
A pot costs 52 silver taels and one sip is worth three silver taels.

121
00:09:03,859 --> 00:09:07,299
After I finish it, it's gone after I pee.

122
00:09:08,659 --> 00:09:13,839
A fine wine deserves a modest master.

123
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,019
If you didn't use some tricks and wrote the letter to attract Qin Qi,

124
00:09:18,019 --> 00:09:20,840
I'm afraid I'm still trapped in Chan State.

125
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:32,060
Is your head messed up after getting beaten inside the tower?

126
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:36,060
I advise you to place your bet on someone else quickly.

127
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:38,660
Someone else?

128
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,430
I invested too much.

129
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:46,939
If I withdraw halfway, I'll lose everything.

130
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:56,579
As long as I'm still on the gambling table, I can recoup my losses.

131
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:19,500
Now, we're disqualified from the Pneuma Combat Convention.

132
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:24,039
- Where are you going next?
- I'll follow wherever my brother goes.

133
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:27,839
If we can't go to the convention, there is always another way.

134
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:34,158
Why don't you dump your troublesome brother? Worship me as your master.

135
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:58,620
You're not bad, it's just that you shouldn't be with us.

136
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,219
Don't you want to roam the martial arts world and become the number one assassin?

137
00:11:02,219 --> 00:11:04,839
Actually, I think you're quite impressive.

138
00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:08,859
Maybe next time when we meet, you'll already have become the number one assassin.

139
00:11:11,979 --> 00:11:13,760
The next time we meet...

140
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,280
Why do you look unhappy?

141
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:22,720
I'm not! I just feel that...

142
00:11:25,239 --> 00:11:30,179
I couldn't get a disciple this time, so I'm feeling quite sad.

143
00:11:46,859 --> 00:11:49,699
Don't worry!

144
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:55,480
You still have a chance.

145
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:04,040
Su Tang, do you know who is the important person I always visit every year at Kaifeng?

146
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,740
- Who is it?
- Who is it?

147
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:15,520
Chu Min? Shining Sky Academy's instructor?

148
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:19,120
So, the person you go visit every year at Kaifeng is her?

149
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,239
I can't believe an old man like you have such an influential friend.

150
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,540
So you decided to stop calling me an old geezer?

151
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,940
Listen carefully!

152
00:12:29,739 --> 00:12:32,799
The Pneuma Combat Convention requires a team of four people to compete.

153
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:36,138
The tower was demolished, so Wind Takers have already been disqualified.

154
00:12:36,138 --> 00:12:39,379
But if you guys worship Chu Min as your master,

155
00:12:39,379 --> 00:12:43,900
we can use Shining Sky Academy's name to join the convention.

156
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:47,538
Surpass Big Dippers and make our ancestors proud; both can be achieved!

157
00:12:47,538 --> 00:12:50,220
Lu Ping already agreed to it.

158
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:53,020
If Brother agrees, I agree, too.

159
00:12:54,080 --> 00:13:00,278
Fine! I'll do this kind deed for my future disciple and let you guys owe me a favor.

160
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,579
Please forgive me for not joining forces.

161
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,639
Master, is Eldest Senior okay?

162
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,100
Xifan.

163
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,560
Master.

164
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:01,580
I saw you peeking just now.

165
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:06,139
What's the matter? Are you feeling reluctant?

166
00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:10,680
Master, I know my own limits.

167
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,920
I shouldn't be going to the Pneuma Combat Convention.

168
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,579
I'm not the one controlling your legs.

169
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:19,959
I'm not stopping you anyway.

170
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:26,160
An ambitious person needs a place to showcase his talent.

171
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,000
You've stayed at Wind Taker Institute for so many years.

172
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,240
It's time for you to go back to the path that you belong to.

173
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,879
I can't win against you.

174
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:41,379
I can't even win against Lu Ping.

175
00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:46,200
I didn't atone for my sins, so I can't hold a blade anymore.

176
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,600
Even if I go to the convention, I can't be of help.

177
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,320
Compared to you, Lu Ping is nothing.

178
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,080
Without Wind Taker Institute, Lu Ping wouldn't be like what he is now.

179
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:00,420
But without you, the Wind Takers wouldn't be as the current Wind Takers.

180
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,220
Xing Luo are dead now.
(TN: Xing Luo were for both Situ Xing and Situ Luo)

181
00:15:09,379 --> 00:15:12,479
The weight is off your shoulders.

182
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,459
Stop it, Master!

183
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:18,399
My leg is injured, so whatever you say is pointless.

184
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,819
It's too early to tell.

185
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:23,039
Drink with me first.

186
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:30,099
I can tell from one glance, that this Zhao Xifan is different from you bumpkins.

187
00:15:30,099 --> 00:15:32,900
He has high self-esteem.

188
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,498
This thing you made.

189
00:15:34,498 --> 00:15:37,178
Could it really make him follow us to Kaifeng?

190
00:15:37,178 --> 00:15:41,920
Brother, all these years, after Eldest Senior joined the Wind Takers, he never returned home or went out.

191
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,819
I'm just afraid there's more to this than what's in front of us.

192
00:15:43,819 --> 00:15:46,679
Didn't Master give you any advice?

193
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,980
I think Master went drinking again.

194
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,939
He didn't leave any message.

195
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,940
After I finish this, send this to him on my behalf.

196
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:00,199
I provoked Eldest Senior many times.

197
00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:03,340
It's better if you guys advise him.

198
00:16:04,859 --> 00:16:06,799
All of you are here?

199
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,559
Lu Ping.

200
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:11,219
When Master Guo bought the wine, he left this.

201
00:16:11,219 --> 00:16:15,039
He said he's buying time for you and asked me to pass this to you.

202
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:17,840
He also said,

203
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,739
"the person who tied the bell..."

204
00:16:19,739 --> 00:16:22,338
- Should untie it.
- "Should untie it" yeah.

205
00:16:22,338 --> 00:16:24,400
Why are you holding the boards?

206
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:28,658
Isn't this our Ruyu House's chair?

207
00:16:28,658 --> 00:16:30,779
Why did it become like this?

208
00:16:34,499 --> 00:16:36,919
It's pretty comfortable.

209
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,320
Master, I should go now.

210
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,819
Don't! Not yet!

211
00:16:49,819 --> 00:16:51,920
Don't leave me.

212
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,980
You completely ignored my feelings.

213
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,460
The Wind Takers offended the Wei family this time.

214
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:02,679
If we don't get a placing in the convention,

215
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:09,260
the centuries-old organization will be ruined.

216
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:12,759
Xifan, why don't you reconsider it? Can you?

217
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:15,179
Master, I gave back the badge already.

218
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:17,439
You should give it to a more suitable person.

219
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,540
Eldest Senior.

220
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:22,678
I have something to return to you. Here!

221
00:17:25,659 --> 00:17:27,459
I already gave it back to Master.

222
00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:30,919
The Eldest Senior should be the Wind Takers' role model; it's better to give it to the God of Bandits.

223
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:34,089
Nope, it's worthless! Even if it's a gift, I won't take it.

224
00:17:34,089 --> 00:17:35,500
You...

225
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:38,839
Eldest Senior, it suits you more.

226
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:40,450
Without you,

227
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,340
I won't be where I am now.

228
00:17:44,139 --> 00:17:47,380
I have my past and you also have your past.

229
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:51,379
Rather than running away, why don't we face it together?

230
00:17:51,379 --> 00:17:53,559
Yes, yes, yes.

231
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,559
You said, your personal matters are none of my business, you can take it back now, right?

232
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,200
I never take my words back.

233
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,780
Let's just say I want to get to know you again.

234
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:08,779
Wait for me! I have something for you.

235
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:30,919
Your craftsmanship is pretty good.

236
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:33,219
Come over here, give it a try!

237
00:18:33,219 --> 00:18:35,210
Come on!

238
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:38,870
Come!

239
00:18:43,819 --> 00:18:45,119
Hold them!

240
00:18:47,619 --> 00:18:50,919
There's hope now to surpass the Big Dippers!

241
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,200
Move forward!

242
00:18:55,139 --> 00:18:58,178
Lu Ping, push him! Did you not eat?

243
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:18,920
Chan State reported that you're already dead.

244
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:26,559
I have important news to inform our Chief immediately.

245
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,490
I was heavily injured by the Wind Takers.

246
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:39,920
I only dared to show myself after hiding for several days.

247
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,800
What a useless junk!

248
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,219
You embarrassed us.

249
00:19:43,219 --> 00:19:46,020
Why don't I pluck your teeth and make a necklace?

250
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,400
The person concerns our Chief's grand plan.

251
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:54,250
I rushed back to report this.

252
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:59,510
I'm very sure that the person is the Awakener, who was kidnapped from the tower three years ago,

253
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:01,319
Lu Ping.

254
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:09,400
- Did you see him clearly?
- Yes.

255
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:15,439
I also heard that he's heading towards Kaifeng for the Pneuma Combat Convention.

256
00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:22,940
I'm willing to go to great lengths to capture him, so I can redeem myself.

257
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:25,000
It's fine.

258
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,179
Since he already showed himself, he won't be able to escape again.

259
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:32,920
Nobody can walk away from Mountain and Sea Gang.

260
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:36,210
Dying here is his destiny.

261
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,699
As for you, you should know the rules of Mountain and Sea Gang.

262
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,800
Take her away!

263
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:58,170
How are the arrangement at Kaifeng?

264
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:00,659
Leader Feng has made the necessary preparations.

265
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:03,599
Your plan may begin at any time.

266
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,999
Pass my order! Don't act rashly and alert the enemy.

267
00:21:07,999 --> 00:21:09,390
Yes.

268
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,520
[Kaifeng City]

269
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,919
The triennial Pneuma Combat Convention is around the corner.

270
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,619
How are the preparations, Master Wen?

271
00:21:28,619 --> 00:21:35,180
Your Majesty, I already negotiated with General Qin and sent invitations to all martial arts academies

272
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:38,539
to recruit talented people from across the kingdom, so we can contribute to the kingdom.

273
00:21:38,539 --> 00:21:39,680
[Xia Bojian - Minister of Defense of the Shuo Kingdom]

274
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:45,279
Your Majesty, in my opinion, Master Wen's actions were inappropriate.

275
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:46,619
[Chai Rong - Emperor of the Shuo Kingdom]

276
00:21:46,619 --> 00:21:49,890
Minister Xia, why do you say so?

277
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:54,959
The selection of generals concern the strength, the rise, and the fall of the kingdom.

278
00:21:54,959 --> 00:21:59,459
For generals of Shuo Kingdom, we should select them from prominent families by right.

279
00:21:59,459 --> 00:22:01,619
Your Majesty, a hero's origin isn't important.

280
00:22:01,619 --> 00:22:05,020
There are many extraordinary people in the martial arts world.

281
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:08,860
If we miss out on them, it will be Shuo Kingdom's loss.

282
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:14,719
In terms of talent, many disciples of Shining Sky Academy have been enlisted over the years.

283
00:22:14,719 --> 00:22:17,359
All of them are excellent in martial arts.

284
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:21,860
In terms of loyalty, imperial relatives come after prominent families.

285
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,439
Their loyalty was indisputable.

286
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,719
How could the martial artists fare against them?

287
00:22:27,719 --> 00:22:31,940
I think that, General Qin has many acquaintances in the martial arts world,

288
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:36,340
especially the people with an unclear background and a suspicious motive.

289
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:39,179
It's a disgrace to Shuo Kingdom.

290
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:41,479
Minister Xia is also the headmaster of Shining Sky Academy.

291
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,519
Naturally, your disciples' capability can't be underestimated.

292
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:47,680
But in my opinion, gathering talented people from all walks of life

293
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,260
is the only root of serving the imperial family.

294
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:53,060
If you're afraid that commoners will overshadow the imperial family,

295
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,900
doesn't this go against the imperial graciousness?

296
00:22:57,699 --> 00:22:59,580
General, you just returned.

297
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,340
You should, at least, take off your armor first .

298
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:04,920
While I'm absent, Minister Xia won't waste this opportunity for sure.

299
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,519
I can't let Master Wen suffer alone.

300
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:12,980
My two officials, you've been planning for this martial arts event.

301
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:15,140
You want the best for the kingdom.

302
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:17,239
Please don't be impatient!

303
00:23:17,239 --> 00:23:20,260
- Your Majesty.
- Agile Dragon Army's General,

304
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:23,780
Qin Qi requests to be presented.

305
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,180
Summon him!

306
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:36,080
Greetings, Your Majesty.

307
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,658
General Qin, you must've had a tiring journey.

308
00:23:38,658 --> 00:23:41,659
Serving the kingdom is my pleasure.

309
00:23:41,659 --> 00:23:47,018
Your Majesty, I heard the martial arts academies are planning to send their disciples to take part in this convention.

310
00:23:47,018 --> 00:23:50,138
Shuo Kingdom's martial artists have never been gathered together.

311
00:23:50,138 --> 00:23:52,760
It's the blessing of Shuo Kingdom.

312
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,920
I'm afraid Minister Xia doesn't believe so.

313
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:02,098
Does Minister Xia still believe that generals should only be from prominent families?

314
00:24:02,098 --> 00:24:03,499
Exactly so!

315
00:24:03,499 --> 00:24:07,299
Your Qin family is prominent and valiant.

316
00:24:07,299 --> 00:24:10,679
They have also cultivated a talented person like General Qin.

317
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:12,299
This proves my point.

318
00:24:12,299 --> 00:24:16,178
Lieutenant general of Left Guard Corps, Li Che, graduated from Chan State Academy.

319
00:24:16,178 --> 00:24:18,439
Since he took office to suppress the northwestern bandits,

320
00:24:18,439 --> 00:24:21,079
he performed a total of 35 meritorious services.

321
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:25,018
Lieutenant general of Imperial Martial Artists, Fang Qiong graduated from Xu State Academy.

322
00:24:25,018 --> 00:24:26,340
This person was a genius.

323
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:29,299
He invented Horse Splitting Formation and fought countless enemies.

324
00:24:29,299 --> 00:24:31,558
Since Master Wen conducts the army selection,

325
00:24:31,558 --> 00:24:35,620
many generals selected from the commoners are talented.

326
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:41,020
But some people from prominent families are incompetent and corrupted.

327
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:45,559
I believe Minister Xia is clearly aware of this.

328
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:49,799
More importantly, the citizens are in turmoil over the years. Really unstable!

329
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:51,979
The citizens are fighting against oppression.

330
00:24:51,979 --> 00:24:56,759
If we can unite the citizens and put them to good use through the Pneuma Combat Convention,

331
00:24:56,759 --> 00:25:00,358
we won't have to worry about Shuo Kingdom's prosperity and stability.

332
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,938
Your Majesty, please forgive my bluntness.

333
00:25:04,938 --> 00:25:08,079
During this convention, you're not only selecting generals,

334
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:11,339
you're also raising the ambitious and fighting spirit of the kingdom.

335
00:25:11,339 --> 00:25:13,160
Nicely spoken!

336
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:20,200
This Pneuma Combat Convention is to enlighten the pneumatic power of Shuo Kingdom.

337
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:25,390
General Qin, I'm looking forward to the kind of talented heroes

338
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:30,800
you and Master Wen will select for our Great Shuo

339
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,640
during this Pneuma Combat Convention.

340
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,620
We won't disappoint, Your Majesty.

341
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,960
General Qin.

342
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:55,100
General Qin, you sounded sure of yourself in the court today.

343
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:59,899
But I still hope that the martial artists you recommend

344
00:25:59,899 --> 00:26:03,259
can be like you, too, to not disappoint His Majesty.

345
00:26:03,259 --> 00:26:07,599
Please look forward to it then, Minister Xia.

346
00:26:21,819 --> 00:26:24,679
Wenrui, I'll send Master Wen home.

347
00:26:24,679 --> 00:26:26,518
Find a doctor for a check-up.

348
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:27,558
Yes.

349
00:26:27,559 --> 00:26:31,658
I'm fine, General! It's just a relapse of my old injury.

350
00:26:31,658 --> 00:26:36,480
In the court just now, thank you for fighting for me.

351
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,938
But at this rate, the hatred between Minister Xia and you grows deeper.

352
00:26:39,938 --> 00:26:41,760
Since there's already a grudge,

353
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:45,079
just leave it be if I can't resolve it.

354
00:26:45,999 --> 00:26:50,040
General, you should plan for your own future.

355
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,659
I'm just an ordinary guy from the martial arts world.

356
00:26:52,659 --> 00:26:54,419
Don't worry about me!

357
00:26:54,419 --> 00:26:56,119
Master Wen,

358
00:26:56,119 --> 00:27:00,398
all these years, if you didn't discuss martial arts with me and organize military affairs,

359
00:27:00,398 --> 00:27:03,158
you won't become a thorn in Xia Bojian's flesh.

360
00:27:03,158 --> 00:27:08,638
Not to mention, if I protect you, I'm also protecting the talented people of the future who will work for Shuo Kingdom.

361
00:27:08,638 --> 00:27:14,760
Master Wen, do you still remember what I said when we were organizing the Pneuma Combat Convention back then?

362
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,240
I still remember.

363
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,938
"The Qin family conquered the world with the previous emperor."

364
00:27:18,938 --> 00:27:21,960
"Knowing that soldiers are the roots of a kingdom."

365
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,919
"If I can bring talented martial artists to Shuo Kingdom,"

366
00:27:24,919 --> 00:27:29,839
"even if I have to go against the whole world, I, Qin Qi, am not afraid."

367
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:34,979
I'm amazed by your lofty spirit.

368
00:27:34,979 --> 00:27:39,678
I'll definitely handle the Pneuma Combat Convention well, so I'll live up to your expectations.

369
00:27:39,678 --> 00:27:45,898
Come with me now! After you rest well, the Pneuma Combat Convention still needs you as a host.

370
00:27:45,898 --> 00:27:49,299
Also, Sang'er...

371
00:27:49,299 --> 00:27:52,139
Sang'er has been wanting to meet you for a long time.

372
00:27:52,139 --> 00:27:56,840
Did Miss create some sort of trouble again and needed you to deal with it?

373
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,359
I instructed you guys not hold back.

374
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:09,378
All of you are pulling your punches, what's the point of fighting?

375
00:28:09,378 --> 00:28:11,380
Dismiss!

376
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:12,959
- Yes.
- Yes.

377
00:28:12,959 --> 00:28:16,458
You fought three people previously; now, you can fight five people.

378
00:28:16,458 --> 00:28:18,500
It seems you've made progress.

379
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:22,219
I heard that when you were at my age, you can fight ten people.

380
00:28:22,219 --> 00:28:24,720
Why don't you train with me?

381
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,198
When I train the Sun Streamer Swordplay with Ziyan, she always holds back.

382
00:28:28,198 --> 00:28:29,458
It's suffocating.

383
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:31,200
Ziyan!

384
00:28:34,659 --> 00:28:37,178
You instructed me before that I can't train with Miss.

385
00:28:37,178 --> 00:28:40,458
I have crossed the line, please forgive me.

386
00:28:46,659 --> 00:28:48,920
It was I who ordered Ziyan.

387
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,819
I know the Sun Streamer Swordplay can't be divulged but I need someone to counter my moves, don't I?

388
00:28:55,819 --> 00:28:58,438
You love roaming the world, I allowed you.

389
00:28:58,438 --> 00:29:01,500
However, the Sun Streamer Swordplay is the Qin family's secret sword technique.

390
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:04,399
Once it's divulged, it disturbs our clan's foundation.

391
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,939
Did you totally ignore what I said?

392
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:12,659
You two, accept your punishments based on the family rules.

393
00:29:14,659 --> 00:29:16,400
Go now!

394
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:24,019
Don't get angry, General! Let me be the mediator.

395
00:29:24,019 --> 00:29:28,438
The Pneuma Combat Convention is upon us, why don't we make a deal here?

396
00:29:28,438 --> 00:29:33,399
If Miss Qin wins the convention, then Miss Ling's and her punishments will be revoked.

397
00:29:33,399 --> 00:29:37,819
If Miss Qin didn't manage to pass, she'll accept your punishment without any objection.

398
00:29:37,819 --> 00:29:39,559
What do you think?

399
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:40,838
- Master Wen...
- All right!

400
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:44,079
It's just a convention, I'll win and show it to you.

401
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:46,400
What do you think, General?

402
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:49,960
Fine!

403
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:53,580
She won't listen to anyone but Master Wen.

404
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:57,880
However, let me tell you! Don't expect Master Wen to cheat for you.

405
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,358
If you want to win, you must rely on your own strength.

406
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:04,518
If I ask Uncle Wen to guide me in martial arts, it's not cheating, right?

407
00:30:04,518 --> 00:30:06,359
Uncle Wen, please!

408
00:30:14,119 --> 00:30:17,280
Uncle Wen, you're the most knowledgeable.

409
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:21,720
Have you heard of a chain that can bind one's Pneuma of Strength?

410
00:30:22,859 --> 00:30:26,599
Why did you suddenly ask this, Miss?

411
00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:27,898
You do know?

412
00:30:27,898 --> 00:30:30,440
Then do you know how to unbind it?

413
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:35,099
Indeed, there's something called the Bloodline Technique to unlock the Pneuma Confinement

414
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:37,078
but it's rare and complicated.

415
00:30:37,078 --> 00:30:42,820
As to whether it can be unbound, it depends on the person.

416
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:46,200
Have you seen this kind of martial arts?

417
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:06,359
Why am I concerned about that rogue?

418
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:11,039
I must concentrate to train my swordsmanship.

419
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:14,759
I must perform well during the Pneuma Combat Convention.

420
00:31:16,659 --> 00:31:18,780
I heard it from a young bandit.

421
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:22,618
Uncle Wen, I'll get a cup of tea for you and we'll continue with the training later.

422
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,378
"Preparations are made in Kaifeng."

423
00:31:43,378 --> 00:31:47,318
"Our Chief orders you to stop chasing after Lu Ping and stay in Chan State for further instructions."

424
00:31:47,318 --> 00:31:50,659
"Failing again won't be forgivable."

425
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:54,279
How gracious His Lord is! It's not our time yet.

426
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:56,539
The Wei family is safe for now.

427
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:57,798
What about our future?

428
00:31:57,798 --> 00:32:00,299
Let's take one step at a time.

429
00:32:00,299 --> 00:32:04,119
Our lives are in the hands of others.

430
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,680
Father.

431
00:32:07,459 --> 00:32:09,799
Father, I've decided.

432
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:13,200
Father, why are you sweating?

433
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,878
The weather is so hot, it's too stuffy! What do you need?

434
00:32:16,878 --> 00:32:18,439
I want to go to Kaifeng for the convention.

435
00:32:18,439 --> 00:32:20,959
If I'm famous, I'll be worthy of Sangsang.

436
00:32:20,959 --> 00:32:22,480
Young Master.

437
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,019
Go if you must!

438
00:32:24,019 --> 00:32:28,438
Wei Ming, let Wei Ying bring the bodyguards with the best martial arts to protect Young Master.

439
00:32:28,438 --> 00:32:30,720
Thank you, Father! I'll write a letter now.

440
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,799
I want to tell Sangsang.

441
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:41,760
Master, Lu Ping is at Kaifeng, too.

442
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,000
It's better to avoid him right now.

443
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,459
The Mountain and Sea Gang's punishment is hanging over our heads.

444
00:32:46,459 --> 00:32:48,838
We are walking on thin ice already.

445
00:32:48,838 --> 00:32:51,378
Let Tianqi do whatever he wants.

446
00:32:51,378 --> 00:32:53,739
The Mountain and Sea Gang treats Lu Ping indifferently.

447
00:32:53,739 --> 00:32:56,698
Tell Wei Ying to protect Tianqi this time!

448
00:32:56,698 --> 00:33:00,019
Don't let him get involved with Lu Ping.

449
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:01,540
Yes.

450
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:22,299
I can't! I can't walk anymore.

451
00:33:29,559 --> 00:33:32,358
Guo Youdao, didn't you get a lot of silver taels from Wei Zhong?

452
00:33:32,358 --> 00:33:34,859
Can't you hire a carriage?

453
00:33:34,859 --> 00:33:36,819
How dare you!

454
00:33:36,819 --> 00:33:39,280
The martial arts tower was so expensive.

455
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,620
I gave them to Chan State Academy.

456
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:44,720
Be thankful that we don't have to beg for food!

457
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,159
Martial arts practitioners shouldn't crave for comfort.

458
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:49,558
It's easy for you to talk! You've been sitting all along.

459
00:33:49,558 --> 00:33:52,060
My disciple was pushing you.

460
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:55,599
Mo Lin, do you want to sleep here

461
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:59,800
or do you want to sleep on a bed in Kaifeng City with a full stomach?

462
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:09,488
Isn't this Miss Qin's golden badge?

463
00:34:09,488 --> 00:34:14,198
Lu Ping, let's go to Kaifeng quickly so we can stay in the most luxurious guest room.

464
00:34:14,198 --> 00:34:15,509
- Yes.
- No way!

465
00:34:15,509 --> 00:34:18,658
Using someone's name to deceive people, how is it different from stealing?

466
00:34:18,658 --> 00:34:20,790
Xifan, catch on when one is poor.

467
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:23,380
Look at him! He can't give up on his principles.

468
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:27,299
Wind Takers must be honorable! Master, this is what you taught us.

469
00:34:27,299 --> 00:34:29,558
- What should we eat?
- We must eat chicken.

470
00:34:29,558 --> 00:34:31,378
- Yes.
- Yes.

471
00:34:31,378 --> 00:34:33,579
Let me think about it.

472
00:34:33,579 --> 00:34:36,488
One whole chicken isn't enough because I, alone, can eat half a chicken.

473
00:34:36,488 --> 00:34:38,440
Let's order two, then.

474
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:51,039
[Shining Sky Academy]

475
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:57,518
Miss, it has been a while since you returned to Shining Sky Academy but you refuse to enter.

476
00:34:57,518 --> 00:35:00,379
Don't you want to visit your peers?

477
00:35:00,379 --> 00:35:03,529
Ziyan, I was here for three years

478
00:35:03,529 --> 00:35:05,820
but I attended classes for less than three months.

479
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:08,000
Do you know why?

480
00:35:10,429 --> 00:35:13,298
Shining Sky Academy only accepts disciples from prominent families.

481
00:35:13,298 --> 00:35:16,809
It's not about martial arts but one's family background.

482
00:35:17,719 --> 00:35:21,960
This type of place isn't as interesting as the Wind Taker Institute.

483
00:35:23,389 --> 00:35:25,289
Junior Qin.

484
00:35:26,739 --> 00:35:28,559
Senior Luo Ting.

485
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,258
Congratulations, Junior.

486
00:35:30,258 --> 00:35:33,738
For the Pneuma Combat Convention, you and I are selected.
[Luo Ting - Shining Sky Academy Disciple]

487
00:35:33,738 --> 00:35:36,979
I wonder if you're interested in forming a team.

488
00:35:36,979 --> 00:35:38,839
Thank you for the kind offer.

489
00:35:38,839 --> 00:35:41,929
Ziyan and I will find two more disciples.

490
00:35:41,929 --> 00:35:44,428
You are highly respected at Shining Sky Academy,

491
00:35:44,428 --> 00:35:47,159
I believe you have better candidates than me.

492
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:56,139
A slave who is protected by you has become a disciple of Shining Sky Academy in exchange.

493
00:35:56,139 --> 00:35:58,359
She's not worth it.

494
00:35:58,359 --> 00:36:02,159
Plus, I heard that you had just returned from experiencing the martial arts world.

495
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:04,488
You're from a prominent family after all.

496
00:36:04,488 --> 00:36:08,099
Roaming among commoners in the martial arts world goes against the decorum.

497
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:10,718
Why don't you mingle with us?

498
00:36:10,718 --> 00:36:13,519
That's only fitting for your identity.

499
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:19,620
I don't care about one's identity.

500
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:21,819
I only look at one's martial arts.

501
00:36:21,819 --> 00:36:24,518
In addition, the world's martial artists come from all walks of life.

502
00:36:24,518 --> 00:36:26,979
There's no shortage of talented people.

503
00:36:26,979 --> 00:36:31,758
Since you're going to the Pneuma Combat Convention, I believe you'll witness it very soon.

504
00:36:33,529 --> 00:36:36,000
Ziyan, let's go!

505
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:46,878
Senior Luo, you're from a prominent family and Headmaster Xia's favorite disciple.

506
00:36:46,878 --> 00:36:49,618
[Qiao Ying - Shining Sky Academy Disciple]
[Shi Zhongtian - Shining Sky Academy Disciple] 
If the Qin family didn't organize the Pneuma Combat Convention,

507
00:36:49,618 --> 00:36:51,918
you would have already joined the military as an official.

508
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:54,979
You won't have to fight with those world's martial artists.

509
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:59,499
You're broad-minded so you chose not to argue with her but she has gotten worse, instead.

510
00:36:59,499 --> 00:37:02,239
She said you're worse than her maid.

511
00:37:03,079 --> 00:37:07,289
[Hongfu Inn]

512
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:31,738
If I knew the Qin family is so powerful in Kaifeng,

513
00:37:31,738 --> 00:37:35,399
I would've asked for one that doubles the price from Qin Sang back then.

514
00:37:35,399 --> 00:37:38,338
At this point in time, do you still want to kill Lu Ping?

515
00:37:38,338 --> 00:37:42,159
Not really! How can I touch our boss?

516
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:44,618
Right, Su Tang! Do you like this room?

517
00:37:44,618 --> 00:37:48,508
It's the most expensive! I have a good taste after all.

518
00:37:49,499 --> 00:37:54,000
All right! Let's keep this room for my brother.

519
00:37:55,179 --> 00:37:56,980
Where is my brother?

520
00:38:06,689 --> 00:38:09,309
Here! If you don't change the dressing,

521
00:38:09,309 --> 00:38:12,079
don't dream of walking again.

522
00:38:12,659 --> 00:38:14,798
Did you cheat again using Qin family's golden badge?

523
00:38:14,798 --> 00:38:17,539
- Don't need it?
- No need!

524
00:38:17,539 --> 00:38:19,129
All right.

525
00:38:19,129 --> 00:38:22,909
Lu Ping, don't you want to fight against Mountain and Sea Gang?

526
00:38:22,909 --> 00:38:25,338
Can you change your bad habits and be a good person?

527
00:38:25,338 --> 00:38:27,299
Eldest Senior,

528
00:38:27,299 --> 00:38:30,899
good people will not only die but they will die even faster.

529
00:38:30,899 --> 00:38:32,769
This is the principle.

530
00:38:34,139 --> 00:38:38,240
When you can walk on your own, let's talk about your principles, then.

531
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,819
- Lu Ping!
- Lu Ping!

532
00:38:40,829 --> 00:38:43,118
- Master.
- Lu Ping, go and take a look inside quickly.

533
00:38:43,118 --> 00:38:45,299
The interior is so luxurious.

534
00:38:45,299 --> 00:38:47,119
Hurry up!

535
00:38:53,219 --> 00:38:56,658
Looking at you, it seems you're determined to sleep outside.

536
00:38:56,658 --> 00:39:00,359
I have never stayed in such a nice guest room.

537
00:39:00,359 --> 00:39:02,339
I won't accompany you then.

538
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:04,089
Master!

539
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:09,419
Help me up!

540
00:39:17,919 --> 00:39:20,198
Have you changed your mind for one?

541
00:39:20,198 --> 00:39:22,739
If I don't rest well and get back on my feet,

542
00:39:22,739 --> 00:39:25,639
that guy, Lu Ping, is going to be on the ninth level of cloud.
(TN: Clouds have 9 levels with the 9th is the highest - one is most elated)

543
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:37,739
Very good! Your provocation is working.

544
00:39:40,529 --> 00:39:42,599
Lu Ping, come here!

545
00:39:46,439 --> 00:39:48,039
What's the matter?

546
00:39:48,909 --> 00:39:51,360
For you to succeed,

547
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:55,718
I have prepared specifically an affordable gift for you.

548
00:39:55,718 --> 00:39:57,539
You have a gift for me?

549
00:40:04,799 --> 00:40:08,000
Master, use it when you pray for our founding master.

550
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,939
I don't need it.

551
00:40:10,969 --> 00:40:14,039
Since the day in the tower, I broke another chain of the Pneuma Confinement Lock.

552
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:16,808
The usage of my Pneuma of Strength isn't limited to burning one joss stick anymore.

553
00:40:16,808 --> 00:40:19,900
I think I can handle the convention.

554
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:25,919
I already taught you most of the things I know.

555
00:40:25,919 --> 00:40:31,079
Only this Kaifeng City can teach you the remaining things.

Mountain and Sea Gang, Mountain and Sea Gang! Other than escaping, can you think of something else?

559
00:40:39,539 --> 00:40:43,818
It's congee! The most famous congee in Kaifeng City.

560
00:40:47,869 --> 00:40:50,518
Young Master, the Pneuma Combat Convention is near.

561
00:40:50,518 --> 00:40:53,138
Master reminded me to be wary of your work-sleep balance.

Where do you want to have your meal today?

563
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:59,979
Not meeting Sangsang, my heart is filled with sadness.

Honorable guests of the Qin family, although our shop is small,

this crab congee is the one and only in Kaifeng City.

Nothing more, nothing less!

571
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:29,359
Martial arts practitioners shouldn't crave for good food.

572
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:33,318
Eldest Senior, martial arts practitioners aren't monks.

Zhao Xifan, I'm cultivating Pneuma of Pivot.

575
00:41:46,828 --> 00:41:50,679
Perception is my focus, so not only must I eat, I must eat good food.

576
00:41:50,679 --> 00:41:54,159
Nobody wants to live an ascetic life like you.

577
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:03,879
So odd! In this congee restaurant, why is there a woman who reeks of alcohol?

578
00:42:03,879 --> 00:42:06,480
It ruins the congee's delicate taste.

579
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,778
What is that smell? It's so familiar.

580

Do you mind sitting in the main room?

585
00:42:36,509 --> 00:42:39,678
I just reached Kaifeng and I came to your restaurant.

586

But you actually tell me that there's no private seat?

Don't you feel bad for all my sweat and tears to come here?

Are those the honorable guests you mentioned?

00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:16,160
♫ I call the Milky Way that isolates us all, blue. ♫

626
00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:22,810
♫ Can a moat be built on the seabed? ♫

627
00:46:22,810 --> 00:46:27,230
♫ Wipe all the words on the paper boat! ♫

628
00:46:27,230 --> 00:46:34,350
♫ Please let someone not remember and don't tell another! ♫

629
00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:41,630
♫ Hide the reluctance between words ♫

630
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:46,230
♫ Unfortunately, I (you) are an average author ♫

631
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:53,950
♫ No matter how you (I) describe the rest, it's unnecessary! ♫

632
00:46:55,910 --> 00:47:04,800
♫ Don't describe my unfulfilled promise! ♫

633
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:13,570
♫ Don't interpret my hidden fire-smoke! ♫

634
00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:22,490
♫ Don't let the paper boat in the rough wave chasing me! ♫

635
00:47:22,490 --> 00:47:31,060
♫ Don't wait until it over to know there are you and me! ♫
