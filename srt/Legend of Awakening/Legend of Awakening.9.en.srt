00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,890
♫ The dark green sea is hazy ♫

3
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,740
♫ dissipating in a flash. ♫

4
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:36,640
♫ Rivers and lakes divide the world. ♫

5
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,000
♫ Ten thousands arrows are firing at once. ♫

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,960
♫ Who has time to worry? Who loves the color of blood? ♫

7
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,790
♫ At that time, spirits are high. ♫

8
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:51,700
♫ Who calls the world his home? Who dares let his horse freely run? ♫

9
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:54,350
♫ Silently, tears form in the death of night. ♫

10
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:58,220
♫ Heroes are cutting all ties, ♫

11
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:02,050
♫ giving up whether it's life or death, ♫

12
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:04,230
♫ never asking what the cost is. ♫

13
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:09,870
♫ Good and evil must be distinguished. ♫

14
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:13,680
♫ The wind blows off the snow. ♫

15
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,620
♫ On the body, etch multiple scars, ♫

16
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,720
♫ wandering all over the world, ♫

17
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:25,190
♫ only wish to ask for answers from this world. ♫

18
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:29,240
♫ A teenager doesn't have to be a hero. ♫

19
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:33,080
♫ There is no need for flowers in the dream. ♫

20
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,270
♫ Destiny need not be afraid. ♫

21
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:40,780
♫ Because you have him all the way, ♫

22
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:44,720
♫ experienced a handful of conquests, ♫

23
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,560
♫ overcame a number of challenges. ♫

24
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,730
♫ From now on, happy and free! ♫

25
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:56,460
♫ The only wish is, with the world, ♫

26
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:00,590

29
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:46,419
Minmin!

30
00:02:46,419 --> 00:02:48,180
Where are you going?

31
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,279
Are you leaving them there?

32
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:56,299
Minmin! You're too much.

33
00:02:56,299 --> 00:02:59,180
You should, at least, give them some tips before leaving.

34
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,699
You're too mean!

35
00:03:00,699 --> 00:03:02,620
Their problem is settled.

36
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,399
And now...

37
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,939
It's about time we catch up.

38
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:10,559
This... this...

[Tripitaka Sutra Pavilion]

40
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:21,838
Master, Chu Min and Guo Youdao have left.

41
00:03:21,839 --> 00:03:25,180
I've also locked Qin Sang in the Tripitaka Sutra Pavilion.

42
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:30,310
Good! Chu Min's departure has saved me some trouble.

43
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:42,439
Ting'er, seal off the Tripitaka Sutra Pavilion, don't let any of them slip away.

44
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:48,159
I'll invite Qin Qi over personally to see his precious sister using banned skills.

45
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,839
Let's see how he can promote the Pneuma Combat Convention then.

46
00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:32,900
Brother, it seems that they have left.

47
00:04:44,979 --> 00:04:47,519
Oh no! This door is locked.

48
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:49,019
Let me!

49
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,180
Once more.

50
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,380
My Pneuma of Strength doesn't work.

51
00:05:04,499 --> 00:05:08,179
Just now... I don't have any pneumatic power left at all.

52
00:05:08,179 --> 00:05:10,240
Just like an invalid.

53
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,630
What's wrong?

54
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,819
I can't smell anything!

55
00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:18,538
Su Tang,

56
00:05:18,538 --> 00:05:23,599
it turns out that Soul Splitting is actually a technique that seals off the main pneumatic meridian and makes us lose our power.

57
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,840
Eldest Senior majors in the Pneuma of Sound.

58
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:39,100
I don't know what you're saying but I can make a close guess.

59
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,260
I also can't hear anything.

60
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:44,340
I think this is why the Soul Splitting has been banned from practice.

61
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:48,880
It not only seals the pneumatic power but also removes the senses related to them.

62
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,738
Doesn't this make us disabled?

63
00:05:50,738 --> 00:05:53,600
Brother, Miss Qin majors in the Pneuma of Vision.

64
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,720
She relies on her eyes.

65
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:06,178
Miss Qin.

66
00:06:06,178 --> 00:06:07,539
- Miss Ling.
- Miss Qin!

67
00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:10,018
- Miss Ling!
- Miss Qin.

68
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:21,099
Miss, Miss!

69
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,319
My eyes...

70
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,279
Minmin.

71
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:42,078
If you have something to say, say it!

72
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:46,160
If you're done asking, I'll head back to check on Lu Ping.

73
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,920
Guo Youdao.

74
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:51,340
Why don't you tell me the truth now?

75
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:55,719
Lu Ping, who exactly is he?

76
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:01,539
An ordinary orphan.

77
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:11,060
If it weren't for his innate talent and his extraordinary physique, I can't be bothered with him.

78
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:16,399
Indeed!

79
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:19,820
If it weren't for his innate talent and extraordinary physique,

80
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:24,639
how can he endure the Pneuma Confinement?

81
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,339
Do you think I drank myself silly?

82
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:39,819
The only one born with the unity of six souls and carries a Pneuma Confinement, can only be that person's son.

83
00:07:39,819 --> 00:07:44,519
If it weren't for him, why would you keep watch over Wind Taker Institute for all these years?

84
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:47,639
Why didn't you tell me he's still alive?

85
00:07:51,619 --> 00:07:54,519
The fewer people know,

86
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:57,160
the safer he is.

87
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,380
Isn't it?

88
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:05,480
Besides, I'm worried you'd be troubled.

89
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:10,220
Since you've found it out, I'll head back to check on Lu Ping now.

90
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,320
What's the rush?

91
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,999
If he can't even handle a trivial thing like Soul Splitting,

92
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,260
how is he fit to be that person's son?

93
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,940
Sit down!

94
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,139
None of us can summon our pneumatic power.

95
00:08:38,139 --> 00:08:40,118
Su Tang lost her strength,

96
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:43,100
Xifan lost his hearing, Mo Lin lost his sense of smell,

97
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:46,019
Miss Qin lost her vision, and Miss Ling lost her lightness skills.

98
00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:48,300
Apart from breaking through the Soul Splitting,

99
00:08:49,239 --> 00:08:51,310
there's no other way.

100
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:53,619
What should we do? Can't we even go and ask for help?

101
00:08:53,619 --> 00:08:56,658
We can't even open the door, how can we get help?

102
00:08:58,139 --> 00:08:59,859
Look at this!

103
00:09:00,699 --> 00:09:04,359
I believe this must be what Madam Chu Min said earlier, the imprint of the Soul Splitting.

104
00:09:04,359 --> 00:09:06,979
This must be caused by the blockage of the meridians.

105
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:10,619
If we walk out of here with this, isn't it the same as going straight to jail?

106
00:09:10,619 --> 00:09:13,738
Chu Min said we only have until dusk.

107
00:09:13,738 --> 00:09:15,859
If we can't break through before the sun sets,

108
00:09:15,859 --> 00:09:20,890
are we going to bear this mark for life as an illegal invalid?

109
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,650
Ziyan, let's go!

110
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:27,559
Where are you going?

111
00:09:28,659 --> 00:09:32,340
You chose to degrade yourselves but the Qin family is always righteous.

112
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,258
I'll never use a banned skill like the Soul Splitting.

113
00:09:34,258 --> 00:09:37,139
Since you're already on board,

114
00:09:37,139 --> 00:09:39,560
why don't you face this challenge head on with me?

115

[Tripitaka Sutra Pavilion]

116
00:09:46,499 --> 00:09:50,410
Luo Ting, don't worry! They are invalid's after using Soul Splitting.

117
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:51,899
Just leave them to me.

118
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:57,579
Luo Ting, that young girl, Su Tang is quite attractive.

119
00:09:57,579 --> 00:10:00,759
If you fancy her, you can do as you wish.

120
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:04,529
All I'm after is Qin Sang and Lu Ping.

121
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:06,978
- Head inside.
- Yes!

122
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:23,479
Qin Sang, you actually brought these people to practice banned skills.

123
00:10:23,479 --> 00:10:25,619
I advise you to surrender;

124
00:10:25,619 --> 00:10:29,310
otherwise, it will affect our relationship.

125
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:31,790
He purposely drew us here.

126
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,940
Senior Luo.

127
00:10:37,739 --> 00:10:40,280
Why don't I offer you a surprise?

128
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:47,019
Let's go!

129
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:48,520
Miss.

130
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:56,019
Everyone, search! Find them!

131
00:10:56,019 --> 00:10:58,019
Don't worry about casualties!

132
00:10:58,019 --> 00:10:59,459
Yes!

133
00:11:16,979 --> 00:11:18,859
How about this? I'll lure them away.

134
00:11:18,859 --> 00:11:21,119
Take care of my mistress.

- Ziyan!
- Ziyan.

136
00:11:23,779 --> 00:11:27,200
There are too many of them, it would be the best if some of us get out.

137
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,800
I'll look for her.

138
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,138
Su Tang, your brother is so cunning.

139
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:47,378
Even ten Luo Tings are no match for him.

140
00:11:47,378 --> 00:11:50,918
Su Tang, I'll distract Luo Ting and his men.

141
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:52,658
You and Mo Lin will hide in here first.

142
00:11:52,658 --> 00:11:54,878
When it's safe, leave the Tripitaka Sutra Pavilion quickly.

143
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:57,899
Bring Master here to wrap things up.

144
00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:01,479
Let's go and find my master, they can't hold them off for too long.

145
00:12:01,479 --> 00:12:03,159
Let's go!

146
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,699
Something is wrong! Did you see it?

147
00:12:19,699 --> 00:12:21,759
My eyelids are twitching, do you see it?

148
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:24,899
Lu Ping and the others must be in trouble, I have to check on them.

149
00:12:26,899 --> 00:12:28,699
Minmin.

150
00:12:28,699 --> 00:12:30,859
It's not fun to drink alone.

151
00:12:30,859 --> 00:12:34,778
Besides, when we both used the Soul Splitting back then,

152
00:12:34,778 --> 00:12:37,960
did anyone worry about us?

153
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:42,459
How can their skills be compared to yours?

154
00:12:42,459 --> 00:12:46,959
In the Soul Splitting, the level of skills aren't relevant.

155
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,319
The key lies in whether they can figure it out in time.

156
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,799
Their emotions and pneumas must relate.

157
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:55,720
That's why I made them do Soul Splitting together.

158
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:00,300
It's to offer them... some inspiration.

159
00:13:05,259 --> 00:13:08,879
Guo Youdao, your disciples have come this far.

160
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:12,400
Shouldn't you have some confidence in them?

161
00:13:23,859 --> 00:13:27,838
Luo Ting said to station some men out here in case someone sneaks out.

162
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,659
He is indeed a Senior Disciple.

163
00:13:29,659 --> 00:13:33,718
Step aside! If not, I won't go easy on you.

164
00:13:33,718 --> 00:13:35,620
I like a lass with guts.

165
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,730
Don't worry! I won't hurt you too badly.

166
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:39,219
Arrest them!

167
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,419
Little one, you have quite smooth skin.

168
00:13:48,419 --> 00:13:50,619
Stay away from my disciple!

169
00:13:53,739 --> 00:13:55,819
Disciple!

170
00:13:55,819 --> 00:13:57,639
What are you doing? Do you want to die?

171
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,719
My mind is very clear but I can't control my actions.

172
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:06,059
This is bad! I got the wrong powder.

173
00:14:06,059 --> 00:14:07,860
Attack!

174
00:14:11,739 --> 00:14:15,300
Beat him up! Beat him to death!

175
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,590
Mastery of Pneumas of Strength and Vision! You've broken through!

176
00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:45,039
You even have the Pneuma of Vision? How did you break through? Teach me!

177
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:48,259
I just thought that since you're already protecting me, how can't I let you get killed?

178
00:14:48,259 --> 00:14:50,120
Somehow, I got my strength back.

179
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,919
Somehow? How am I to learn from that?

180
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:54,998
Step aside if you can't, I'll hold the fort here.

181
00:14:54,998 --> 00:14:57,339
Try to sneak out of here! Bring my master to save my brother. Go!

182
00:14:57,339 --> 00:15:01,118
Don't go easy on her, attack all at once! Arrest them both!

183
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,840
So weird!

184
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:14,910
Was it because Shi Zhongtian hit me that I'm going to die now?

185
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,400
[Economy]

186
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:43,479
Come with me!

187
00:15:55,859 --> 00:15:57,420
Hold on!

188
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:14,519
Let's go!

189
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,699
Let's go!

190
00:16:45,599 --> 00:16:46,940
- Senior, how is it?
- How is it over there?

191
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,759
It's fine, I was mistaken.

192
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:50,400
Keep searching!

193
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:55,059
Senior Luo.

194
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,520
We found that a back door was forced open.

195
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:06,179
Well, they really thought they could escape.

196
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:11,358
She's from the Qin family, I'll have to go in person to be respectful.

197
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,040
Let's go!

198
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:37,140
You... How did you do that?

199
00:17:37,999 --> 00:17:40,310
That might be the Soul Splitting break through.

200
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:45,139
In a panic, that pneumatic power suddenly came charging out of my meridians.

201
00:17:45,139 --> 00:17:48,210
You can hear me? Did you break through?

202
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,039
You're forcing yourself to obstruct Soul Splitting.

203
00:17:56,039 --> 00:18:01,258
Madam Chu Min said if we obstruct Soul Splitting, we'll be severely hurt by the backlash.

204
00:18:01,258 --> 00:18:04,479
It's too late! Luo Ting won't spare Lu Ping.

205
00:18:04,479 --> 00:18:07,521
I can't let the disciple of Wind Taker Institute be bullied.

206
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:18,049
I found them! Lu Ping is in danger.

207
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:33,238
Luo Ting will catch up soon, we have to find a spot to break through the Soul Splitting quickly.

208
00:18:33,939 --> 00:18:37,938
Lu Ping, Xia Bojian wants to use this against my brother.

209
00:18:37,938 --> 00:18:42,279
If I used the Soul Splitting, Qin family is doomed.

210
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:44,839
Let's get out of here first, we'll ask my brother for help.

211
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:47,919
Not an option! You have yet to break through the Soul Splitting.

212
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:52,620
You'll be totally helpless, I can't let you leave.

213
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:56,149
Luo Ting and his men will take advantage of you. Let's go!

214
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:02,140
I'm very grateful to you for saving me in the martial arts tower.

215
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,550
But we are different after all.

216
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:09,318
You just have to be responsible for yourself, I have to be responsible for the Qin family.

217
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,610
Let's go our own ways.

218
00:19:14,459 --> 00:19:16,319
Junior Sister.

219
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:22,939
You asked him to get lost and he's still willing to protect you.

220
00:19:22,939 --> 00:19:24,750
I'm really touched.

221
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:27,330
Luo Ting, I'm the one you want.

222
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:29,450
Don't drag others into this!

223
00:19:29,959 --> 00:19:33,919
Of course! I just need to bring you back to complete my task.

224
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:37,790
As for this scoundrel, it's better if he's dead.

225
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,239
Run! Leave it to me.

226
00:19:42,239 --> 00:19:43,739
Let's go!

227
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:12,518
I even thought you'd be amazing but you only looked like it.

228
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:15,919
How can anyone master the Pneuma of Essence so easily?

229
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:26,859
Ling Ziyan! How did she also break through the Soul Splitting?

230
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:35,239
There seems to be a basement ahead, let's hide in there.

231
00:20:38,719 --> 00:20:42,339
Why would Miss Qin be involved in the Soul Splitting for no reason?

232
00:20:42,339 --> 00:20:44,100
Master Xia, is this a false accusation?

233
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,639
Wen Rui.

234
00:20:49,479 --> 00:20:54,979
Master Xia, my sister might not be talented but she's, at least, law-abiding.

235
00:20:54,979 --> 00:20:58,939
You claimed that she performed the Soul Splitting on her own, is there evidence to prove it?

236
00:20:58,939 --> 00:21:03,899
As the Headmaster of Shining Sky Academy, why would I put the academy's reputation at risk?

237
00:21:03,899 --> 00:21:08,780
As for the evidence, why don't you come with me and take a look for yourself?

238
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,640
That will clear things up.

239
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:16,020
Even if it is as you said, everyone in Shining Sky Academy knows my sister's identity.

240
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:22,259
I am certain that someone with bad intentions must have set her up for it.

241
00:21:22,259 --> 00:21:24,600
You're right, General!

242
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,450
It's an outsider who insisted on staying at our academy.

243
00:21:27,459 --> 00:21:30,100
I heard he's called Lu Ping.

244
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,879
Lu Ping?

245
00:21:35,659 --> 00:21:38,840
Wen Rui, do a roll call and set out.

246
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:43,458
Bear this in mind! No matter what happens, Qin Sang's safety comes first.

247
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:45,040
Yes.

248
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,070
Lu Ping?

249
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,110
Where are you?

250
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,780
You didn't really die, did you?

251
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:10,518
Let go! It hurts! Let go of me.

252
00:22:10,518 --> 00:22:13,900
Lu Ping? You're not dead?

253
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,219
Why didn't you make a sound?

254
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,499
Am I that weak?

255
00:22:20,499 --> 00:22:24,010
It's so dark in here, so I was looking for candles.

256
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:28,719
Besides, if it weren't to save you, how could I get into such a predicament?

257
00:22:28,719 --> 00:22:33,019
I already scolded you to drive you away, why did you head back to save me?

258
00:22:35,399 --> 00:22:37,500
In Chenqiao town,

259
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:42,100
I thought that you were just a hot-blooded fool.

260
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:48,040
Just now, I realized that I'm actually the real fool.

261
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,239
You're right.

262
00:22:50,239 --> 00:22:54,818
You overestimate yourself and got bruised all over, what are you if not a fool?

263
00:22:56,619 --> 00:22:58,519
How is this called getting bruised?

264
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:03,659
If I were with the Mountain and Sea Gang, this is no more than a tickle.

265
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:10,699
Lu Ping, did you suffer a lot in the Mountain and Sea Tower?

266
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,580
It's all in the past, not worth mentioning.

267
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:21,499
There's a drawback though; I can't stand to see others suffer.

268
00:23:24,039 --> 00:23:26,540
Especially pretty girls.

269
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,800
Anyway, thank you!

270
00:23:39,959 --> 00:23:42,260
How are you going to thank me?

271
00:23:43,019 --> 00:23:47,358
Let me make it clear! I'm not interested in your body.

272
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,159
It hurts!

273
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:59,039
Shining Sky Academy isn't that big, Luo Ting and his men will find their way here soon.

274
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,181
What should we do if we still haven't broken through the Soul Splitting by then?

275
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:08,819
You don't want to drag your brother into this and I want to attend the Pneuma Combat Convention.

276
00:24:08,819 --> 00:24:13,119
Now that we're in the same boat, we'll have to roll with the punches.

277
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:15,419
Play it by ear!

278
00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:17,559
You have quite the strength.

279
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:20,059
When Luo Ting gets here, knock him out.

280
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:21,898
We can't let him have anything on us.

281
00:24:21,898 --> 00:24:25,019
At times like this, can you stop bragging?

282
00:24:25,019 --> 00:24:27,838
I'm blind and you're disabled, how can we fight?

283
00:24:27,838 --> 00:24:31,439
But I can still see and you can still fight.

284
00:24:31,439 --> 00:24:35,339
How about this? I'll be your eyes and you'll be my sword.

285
00:24:35,339 --> 00:24:38,200
You'll strike where I tell you to strike.

286
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,340
Chu Min said that Soul Splitting is a gamble.

287
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:43,219
Would you like a taste of being a winner?

288
00:24:54,139 --> 00:24:56,280
Senior.

289
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,618
Did you let Su Tang get away to seek help?

290
00:24:58,618 --> 00:25:02,819
Do you know that three of them have already broke through the Soul Splitting?

291
00:25:02,819 --> 00:25:07,679
If Lu Ping and Qin Sang also break through, we won't have any evidence.

292
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,319
Luo Ting, what should we do now?

293
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:13,319
Master will be here with Qin Qi soon.

294
00:25:14,719 --> 00:25:16,459
Keep searching!

295
00:25:16,459 --> 00:25:20,579
Meanwhile, make a ruckus and interfere with them.

296
00:25:20,579 --> 00:25:24,318
Since ancient times, many have died from the Soul Splitting.

297
00:25:24,318 --> 00:25:26,660
I don't believe they are any exceptions.

298
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:30,738
Also, get Qiaoying here, I have an idea.

299
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:33,039
That's enough! Stop drinking, Minmin.

300
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:36,200
It's about time.

301
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,998
It's enough for others.

302
00:25:37,998 --> 00:25:40,078
Lu Ping will need more of an effort.

303
00:25:40,078 --> 00:25:42,159
His Pneuma Confinement.

304
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:46,490
Extraordinary measures have to be taken.

305
00:25:46,999 --> 00:25:50,400
- This...
- Master, Master!

306
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:53,738
Su Tang? Did you break through Soul Splitting? What about others?

307
00:25:53,738 --> 00:25:56,218
Master, Luo Ting brought his men to arrest my brother.

308
00:25:56,218 --> 00:25:58,838
I managed to defeat Zhongtian and found my way here.

309
00:25:58,838 --> 00:26:01,160
Please go and save my brother!

310
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:04,799
How did Luo Ting know that Lu Ping is using the Soul Splitting?

311
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:08,119
Xia Bojian must have instigated him.

312
00:26:10,939 --> 00:26:14,039
Step aside! Move, move, step aside!

313
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:27,579
Xia Bojian is taking Qin Qi to Shining Sky Academy, what on earth is he up to?

314
00:26:27,579 --> 00:26:30,579
He's taking Qin Qi to see Qin Sang under the Soul Splitting.

315
00:26:30,579 --> 00:26:34,440
The Qin family's reputation will be ruined.

316
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,838
All I thought about was the Soul Splitting.

317
00:26:36,838 --> 00:26:40,460
Who knew that old man would make use of it?

318
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,580
Minmin, what are you up to?

319
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:48,899
Stall him for a while by acting drunk, Su Tang and I will alert the others.

320
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:53,299
If government officials interfere with this, your dear Lu Ping is doomed.

321
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:00,959
I drank too much! I drank too much! I drank too much!

322
00:27:02,139 --> 00:27:03,540
It hurts so much!

323
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,780
- It really hurts a lot.
- Don't touch my tea leaves!

324
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:07,979
Don't touch my tea leaves!

325
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:11,819
It hurts!

326
00:27:11,819 --> 00:27:14,440
I can't stand it.

327
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,999
He hit me!

328
00:27:20,419 --> 00:27:23,579
Three steps forward to your left, three inches upwards.

329
00:27:26,619 --> 00:27:28,480
It won't work! There is interference.

330
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,418
I can't hear the sound of the pebble.

331
00:27:30,418 --> 00:27:34,038
Miss Qin, don't listen with your ears! Just follow my instructions.

332
00:27:34,038 --> 00:27:37,179
It won't go wrong. Again!

333
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:53,878
I know that someone is hiding in the Tripitaka Sutra Pavilion to practice the banned skills.

334
00:27:53,878 --> 00:27:56,299
I've specially invited General Qin to see for himself.

335
00:27:56,299 --> 00:28:00,839
Coincidentally, we ran into your old acquaintance who was pestering General Qin after he got drunk.

336
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:04,259
I made the decision to bring him here.

337
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:14,819
General Qin, Master Chu Min is trying to stop us from entering the Tripitaka Sutra Pavilion.

338
00:28:14,819 --> 00:28:16,698
She's doing everything she can to stall for time.

339
00:28:16,698 --> 00:28:21,930
By now, you should believe that there's something fishy going on here with your sister in the Tripitaka Sutra Pavilion?

340
00:28:22,439 --> 00:28:26,060
This issue is about the Soul Splitting, no one is to act without orders.

341
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:28,459
- Keep an eye on them!
- Yes.

342
00:28:28,459 --> 00:28:30,159
Master Xia.

343
00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:38,319
Master.

344
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:40,100
We're doomed!

345
00:28:41,139 --> 00:28:44,739
This time, Wind Taker Institute will be shut down.

346
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,940
Two steps to the right, two inches down.

347
00:28:59,719 --> 00:29:01,278
You simply don't trust me.

348
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,899
What if you aren't accurate?

349
00:29:02,899 --> 00:29:07,559
Miss Qin, this place isn't that big, Luo Ting will find us very soon.

350
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,560
I can't do it!

351
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,619
I had always wanted to help my brother.

352
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:17,050
In the end, I'm the one to drag him down.

353
00:29:17,579 --> 00:29:19,419
I'm really useless.

354
00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:35,680
What is that song?

355
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:38,859
I don't know, either.

356
00:29:38,859 --> 00:29:43,019
This song has been in my head since I was a child.

357
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,059
Those years in Mountain and Sea Tower,

358
00:29:47,059 --> 00:29:49,500
when it was more than I could bear,

359
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:54,119
I'd hum this song to keep myself going.

360
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:55,680
What about you?

361
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,620
Is there anything that can keep you going?

362
00:29:59,219 --> 00:30:01,950
I don't want to just be a daughter of an aristocratic family.

363
00:30:02,719 --> 00:30:05,140
I also want to attain achievements.

364
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:08,640
At least...

365
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,259
At least, I should be a heroine, shouldn't I?

366
00:30:11,259 --> 00:30:13,160
Qin Sang.

367
00:30:14,899 --> 00:30:17,199
We're actually not any different.

368
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,339
We, each has something that keeps us going.

369
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,839
Therefore, I'd like you to trust me.

370
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:26,480
I can be your eyes.

371
00:30:34,099 --> 00:30:37,378
This is bad! We're too late.

372
00:30:41,939 --> 00:30:45,419
You two, indeed, are hiding in here.

373
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:52,399
Junior Sister, I knew it! The Soul Splitting isn't that easy to break through.

374
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:55,879
Master will be here soon, your brother should be with him.

375
00:30:55,879 --> 00:30:58,160
By then, I won't be able to help you.

376
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:02,139
Just come at me if you can, what kind of hero bullies a girl?

377
00:31:02,139 --> 00:31:05,850
Sure! I'll get rid of you first

378
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:08,750
before I beat some sense into Junior Sister.

379
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,358
Young lad, aren't you highly skilled?

380
00:31:31,358 --> 00:31:36,780
When I sever your tendons, we'll see if you can still be so arrogant.

381
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:46,380
Heroine, two steps to the right, two inches upwards.

382
00:32:45,219 --> 00:32:49,018
I've already sent my disciples to bring your sister over, I reckon there must be a conflict.

383
00:32:49,018 --> 00:32:51,178
Why don't General Qin head over to take a look?

384
00:32:51,178 --> 00:32:52,720
Let's go!

385
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:58,000
Sang'er!

386
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:04,778
Lu Ping, so what if you broke through? Qin Qi won't spare you.

387
00:33:04,778 --> 00:33:06,899
We're in here!

388
00:33:06,899 --> 00:33:10,180
Qin Sang, I'm sorry.

389
00:33:15,959 --> 00:33:17,720
Brother.

390
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:24,340
What happened?

391
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,559
Step outside!

392
00:33:36,859 --> 00:33:38,418
What happened in here?

393
00:33:38,418 --> 00:33:43,899
Luo Ting, didn't you get a tip that Qin Sang is practicing the Soul Splitting here?

394
00:33:43,899 --> 00:33:45,680
What Soul Splitting?

395
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:48,079
I've never heard of it.

396
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:53,238
Master, they only just broke through the Soul Splitting.

397
00:33:53,238 --> 00:33:55,798
Interrogate them carefully and you'll definitely get an answer

398
00:33:55,798 --> 00:33:57,799
Luo Ting,

399
00:33:57,799 --> 00:34:01,199
for the sake of Miss Qin's reputation, I wasn't going to bring it up.

400
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,359
You're now accusing me first.

401
00:34:04,359 --> 00:34:08,438
You're the one who acted with ill-intention and tried to take advantage of Miss Qin.

402
00:34:08,438 --> 00:34:10,639
How dare you!

403
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:17,339
This is all nonsense! He's full of tricks! Don't believe him!

404
00:34:17,339 --> 00:34:19,730
Miss Qin and I met up in here to practice swordplay.

405
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:21,670
This man has long lusted after Miss Qin.

406
00:34:21,678 --> 00:34:25,358
He had actually followed her here; fortunately, I subdued him.

407
00:34:25,358 --> 00:34:27,939
Miss Qin can vouch for me.

408
00:34:27,939 --> 00:34:32,378
Brother, could I have ripped my own clothes?

409
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:36,139
- Wen Rui!
- Master, save me!

410
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:38,500
- General Qin, wait!
- Master!

411
00:34:46,779 --> 00:34:51,639
General Qin, let's deal with Luo Ting's issue later.

412
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:54,238
The evidence that proves your sister of practicing the Soul Splitting was found.

413
00:34:54,238 --> 00:34:57,159
Would you care to check?

414
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:05,580
Eldest Senior.

415
00:35:07,819 --> 00:35:11,079
Xifan, are you both all right?

416
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:13,839
Did Xia Bojian find any evidence?

417
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:17,599
Master, don't worry! We've broken through the Soul Splitting.

418
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:34,338
Too bad! Why did he get caught as well?

419
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,678
This is Miss Qin's friend.

420
00:35:47,678 --> 00:35:50,039
He was found passed out in the courtyard.

421
00:35:50,039 --> 00:35:52,658
There's still the imprint of the Soul Splitting on him.

422
00:35:52,658 --> 00:35:56,020
Miss Qin, how will you explain it?

423
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:21,320
The imprint of some Soul Splitting?

424
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:24,139
It's just some dirt on his hand.

425
00:36:24,139 --> 00:36:27,240
Do you have to go to jail for being unhygienic in Shining Sky Academy?

426
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:30,139
What a smooth talker! Soul Splitting is dangerous.

427
00:36:30,139 --> 00:36:33,198
This person obviously fainted because he couldn't bear the pressure of the Soul Splitting.

428
00:36:33,198 --> 00:36:35,338
Master, I told you he's crafty.

429
00:36:35,338 --> 00:36:39,289
we should arrest him and interrogate him under torture, he will surely confess.

430
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:43,139
Why isn't he awake?

431
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:05,338
I was just too tired from reading in the Tripitaka Sutra Pavilion, so I took a nap.

432
00:37:05,338 --> 00:37:08,689
Which one of you is blind and accused me of using any sort of some Soul Splitting?

433
00:37:08,689 --> 00:37:10,679
Master, don't be fooled by him!

434
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:15,179
Master Xia claimed that the Soul Splitting is dangerous, how can it be broken so easily?

435
00:37:15,179 --> 00:37:18,059
Luo Ting, do you wish to make Master Xia look bad?

436
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:34,980
It's our academy's misfortune to have a scum like you.

437
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:38,679
General Qin, please leave this treacherous disciple to me.

438
00:37:38,679 --> 00:37:43,059
I'll be sure to punish him severely and definitely won't go light on him.

439
00:37:43,059 --> 00:37:47,170
The disciple of Shining Sky Academy should be disciplined by you.

440
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:52,239
However, as for him, he has to be punished for my sister.

441
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,718
The Pneuma Combat Convention is around the corner.

442
00:37:59,718 --> 00:38:03,960
His Majesty has no intention of worrying about miscellaneous affairs.

443
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,579
Therefore, here's my advice to you.

444
00:38:06,579 --> 00:38:09,090
Do not stir up trouble!

445
00:38:09,659 --> 00:38:12,578
Sang'er, let's go home!

446
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:40,178
Brother, I really thought you would get hurt.

447
00:38:40,178 --> 00:38:43,740
You already broke through Soul Splitting, why didn't you tell us sooner?

448
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:46,618
A hero always shows up at the end.

449
00:38:46,618 --> 00:38:49,059
Besides, you broke through it first.

450
00:38:49,059 --> 00:38:53,499
If I don't seize the right timing, how can I emphasize my importance?

451
00:38:53,499 --> 00:38:58,570
By the way, Lu Ping, how did you know that I would be able to duck Luo Ting's attack?

452
00:38:59,139 --> 00:39:00,759
I didn't.

453
00:39:00,759 --> 00:39:03,319
You didn't?

454
00:39:03,319 --> 00:39:07,358
If I failed to break through, wouldn't I get killed?

455
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:09,699
The imprint of Soul Splitting has already vanished.

456
00:39:09,699 --> 00:39:11,398
I just wanted to see how long you would fake it.

457
00:39:11,399 --> 00:39:14,160
Am I right, Master Chu Min?

458
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:27,788
Minmin, you can't escape from me.

459
00:39:27,788 --> 00:39:29,419
Go!

460
00:39:30,319 --> 00:39:32,719
[Qin Residence]

461
00:39:44,529 --> 00:39:46,340
Leave us!

462
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:58,740
Aren't you going to explain to me what happened in the Tripitaka Sutra Pavilion today?

463
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:03,738
Brother, how do you expect a girl to explain that to you?

464
00:40:03,738 --> 00:40:07,129
Then, tell me how you mastered the Pneuma of Vision.

465
00:40:10,429 --> 00:40:13,429
Brother, I'm wrong.

466
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:17,199
What are you wrong about?

467
00:40:18,389 --> 00:40:24,859
I shouldn't have practiced the Soul Splitting in order to make Qin family proud like you do.

468
00:40:26,779 --> 00:40:31,329
I shouldn't crave for success just to be complimented by you.

469
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:38,220
All the more, I shouldn't be so smart as to mar my reputation

470
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:41,470
to stop Xia Bojian from framing you.

471
00:40:42,309 --> 00:40:43,980
You're smart?

472
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:46,219
You were fooling around!

473
00:40:46,219 --> 00:40:50,719
Soul Splitting aside, how can you take your reputation so lightly?

474
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:56,618
I know I was wrong and won't dare to do it again.

475
00:40:56,618 --> 00:40:59,389
Just punish me like you used to.

476
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,830
You...

477
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:10,460
You just know I can't bear to punish you.

478
00:41:11,809 --> 00:41:13,879
Don't gloat too soon!

479
00:41:13,879 --> 00:41:16,019
The rumor of Soul Splitting will cause some ripples.

480
00:41:16,019 --> 00:41:19,059
As for those rumors, I'll suppress them.

481
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:23,180
But from this day on, you're grounded!

482
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:27,399
Why? If I'm grounded... What if...

483
00:41:27,399 --> 00:41:30,258
What if I want lotus flower pastries from Zuiyun Restaurant?

484
00:41:30,258 --> 00:41:32,740
Who do you want to eat it with?

485
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,769
Do you think I don't know who you wish to see?

486
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:41,040
I don't want to see him.

487
00:41:51,239 --> 00:41:56,640
Sang'er, I won't look into the Soul Splitting incident.

488
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,708
But Lu Ping's identity is unknown, his background is questionable.

489
00:42:00,708 --> 00:42:05,800
I can overlook his previous mistake but you're not to interact with him again.

490
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:09,300
You're my sister.

491
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:13,119
You're also the center of everyone's attention at this year's Pneuma Combat Convention.

492
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:15,989
You can't afford to make a single mistake.

493
00:42:15,989 --> 00:42:17,820
Do you understand?

494
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:20,899
I understand.

495
00:42:20,899 --> 00:42:25,189
As long as I can be of assistance, I'm willing to do anything for you.

Stay alert!

498
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:46,139
Minmin, what do you think about these adorable disciples?

499
00:42:46,139 --> 00:42:48,439
Do you like them?

500
00:42:50,018 --> 00:42:53,780
It's just Soul Splitting, what's the big deal?

501
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:12,239
Don't gloat too soon!

502
00:43:12,239 --> 00:43:15,519
I have many more ways to torture you.

503

Be sure to wake up and come here early tomorrow!

Greetings, Master! Please allow us to kowtow to you.

[Ending OST: "The Paper Boat"]
[by Zhiqian Xue — Singers: Zhiqian Xue and Kewei Yu]

506
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:15,540
♫ Waiting to be buried by the lake in the town, ♫

507
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:21,670
♫ the White Paper Boat drifting with sorrow. ♫

508
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:27,460
♫ Lights on the other side of the sea ♫

509
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:36,420
♫ punched fingertips in the red water tower. ♫

510
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:45,600
♫ Watch the little boat churning, laughing at the ordinariness. ♫

511
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:49,800
♫ Like a kite being pulled into a low altitude, ♫

512
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:55,260
♫ I smiled to the leaving person. ♫

513
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:59,650
♫ The more spotlight, the more vivid the story. ♫

514
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:04,620
♫ Laughing like the moon, ♫

515
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:09,080
♫ regretting the lighthouse broke in the waves, ♫

516
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:16,590
♫ I call the Milky Way that isolates us all, blue. ♫

517
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:23,710
♫ Like a moat built under the sea, ♫

518
00:45:23,710 --> 00:45:28,500
♫ waiting for the words on the paper boat to disappear, ♫

519
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:36,410
♫ there must always be someone who doesn’t remember listening to the other. ♫

520
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:43,190
♫ Anyone who is correctly guessed will end in disfavor. ♫

521
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:47,370
♫ You are particularly touched but others consider it ordinary. ♫

522
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:52,760
♫ Like the author, roughly put down with a weak stroke, ♫

523
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:57,150
♫ the writing boat on the lake was just like a paper crane in the air. ♫

524
00:45:57,150 --> 00:46:01,970
♫ Laughing like the moon, ♫

525
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:06,650
♫ regretting the lighthouse broke in the waves, ♫

526
00:46:06,650 --> 00:46:14,900
♫ I call the Milky Way that isolates us all, blue. ♫

527
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:21,660
♫ Can a moat be built on the seabed? ♫

528
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:25,900
♫ Wipe all the words on the paper boat! ♫

529
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:33,380
♫ Please let someone not remember and don't tell another! ♫

530
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:40,480
♫ Hide the reluctance between words ♫

531
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:45,160
♫ Unfortunately, I (you) are an average author ♫

532
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:53,260
♫ No matter how you (I) describe the rest, it's unnecessary! ♫

533
00:46:54,790 --> 00:47:03,580
♫ Don't describe my unfulfilled promise! ♫

534
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:12,420
♫ Don't interpret my hidden fire-smoke! ♫

535
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:21,350
♫ Don't let the paper boat in the rough wave chasing me! ♫

536
00:47:21,350 --> 00:47:29,900
♫ Don't wait until it's over to know there are you and me! ♫
