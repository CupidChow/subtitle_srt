00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,859
Lu Ping, it's so hard for me to be a hero.

161
00:14:17,859 --> 00:14:21,459
You ran so fast. You didn't even give people a chance to say thank you.

162
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:26,900
I am not a hero. I'm atoning for my sins.

163
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:31,340
Brother, what will you do to those people who were saved?

164
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:36,739
Don't worry. I've already asked someone to register them. They can live temporarily near the camp.

165
00:14:36,739 --> 00:14:42,060
Ziyan, long time no see. You have grown up.

166
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:46,620
Xifan already went to inform His Majesty. I think everyone will welcome you back.

167
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,939
Agile Dragon Army, on my command! Arrows ready.

168
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:22,119
What's going on? Are they foes or brothers?

169
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,740
Do you think those two will starting fighting?

170
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:30,120
It seems there won't be any reconciliation with Senior Brother.

171
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,579
We are in the army, it's a battlefield.

172
00:15:33,579 --> 00:15:38,519
There are no grudges or hatred here, only strict obedience. The war is coming.

173
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:42,580
There's no room in a camp for a criminal who attempted to assassinate His Majesty.

174
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,679
Xifan, it is dangerous in Jin.

175
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:49,600
Lu Ping and his men are a fresh force, here to help.

176
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:54,019
Lu Ping, where is Miss?

177
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:58,420
She left with you that day. Where is she?

178
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,430
I buried her...

179
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,580
in Big Dipper.

180
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,020
- I will kill you!
- What are you doing?

181
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,219
Yan Xifan, you thankless wretch, what the hell are you doing?

182
00:16:19,219 --> 00:16:21,160
Get going.

183
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,680
If you don't go, then you will be killed.

184
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:29,560
Everyone. Take out the medicine.

185
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,660
We are not welcomed here. We don't have to stay.

186
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,480
See you next time.

187
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,480
Greetings, Your Majesty.

188
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:23,010
I heard that Lu Ping came, is that right?

189
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:25,130
Yes.

190
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:30,360
I want to know what you think.

191
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:34,060
I have researched the route and I've mastered the defense of the city.

192
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,300
There's no need to ask that rebel for help.

193
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:46,900
Are you afraid that if you brought him before me, I'd order him to be killed?

194
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,359
I only know that the war is on the way. I want to make sure it's foolproof.

195
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:55,019
Lu Ping's temperament is unstable and he's hard to control. His help may cause trouble.

196
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,240
I don't doubt my men.

197
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:07,440
Since you've said it, I'll believe you for now.

198
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:14,140
But the fate of the people cannot be ignored.

199
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:16,380
If we can't break into the city,

200
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:20,080
I can only yield and hold peace talks with them.

201
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:26,660
It's just that... the prior emperor's work in creating this country

202
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,960
will have been in vain.

203
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,280
I...

204
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:37,640
really can't bear it.

205
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,720
I understand.

206
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:49,180
For me, Jin is not only an important city on the border,

207
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:54,940
it is my hometown. I will get it back at any cost.

208
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:03,440
Tomorrow, we will begin to attack the city.

209
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,200
It's going to be very dangerous.

210
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:11,420
I selected you not only because you were the best in the Agile Dragon Army,

211
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:15,100
but because you have brothers still at home.

212
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:20,500
If you die for your country, you have brothers around to still take care of your parents.

213
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:25,320
If anyone among you is unwilling, you can leave immediately.

214
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:37,980
Good. Since no one wants to leave,

215
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,660
from now on,

216
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:46,300
as long as one of us is still alive, as long as one of us has breath left,

217
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:51,319
we have only one goal. We pledge our lives to take back Jin!

218
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:54,239
Pledge our lives to take back Jin!

219
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:57,979
Pledge our lives to take back Jin!

220
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:09,180
Xifan, I will live with you and die with you.

221
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,139
So stubborn. And hopeless!

222
00:20:19,139 --> 00:20:21,640
Exactly. He treated our kindness as if it was nothing.

223
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:25,020
We help him in the name of Big Dipper, but he won't accept it.

224
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,760
It's not just that either.

225
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:31,840
Hatred for someone who's killed his father isn't easy to forget.

226
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:36,799
I couldn't either. So I can't argue or fight with Xifan.

227
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,040
Brother, don't blame yourself.

228
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:44,160
Senior Brother said that the Mountain and Sea Gang was the one who dealt Master Yan his fatal blow.

229
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,700
But I still attacked his father.

230
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,640
I think Yan Xifan seems to enjoy being an official.

231
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,180
Who knows? Maybe one day he'll do what his dad did and sell you off, too.

232
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:56,120
It's all in the past.

233
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:02,000
No one can really figure out who was right or wrong.

234
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,560
Then, what should we do next?

235
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:10,760
All in all, the common people are innocent.

236
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:15,280
Since the Agile Dragon Army isn't willing to cooperate with us,

237
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,220
we can deal with Jianghu matters through the ways of Jianghu.

238
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,040
That stupid blood bag!

239
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:05,459
Didn't Uncle say that this was foolproof? Then, where did Lu Ping come from?

240
00:22:05,459 --> 00:22:09,660
If I had known earlier, I would've killed him along with Chu Min back at the Mountain and Sea Gang

241
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:12,040
avoiding future troubles.

242
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:18,620
If he cooperates with Yan Xifan, they'll become more powerful.

243
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:25,060
Quickly rearrange the defense of the Force Eaters again.

244
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:28,239
We can't let Lu Ping get into Jin.

245
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,979
Yes. Yes. That's right. We can't have them start working together.

246
00:22:31,979 --> 00:22:36,320
Masters, congratulations. I just did some investigating.

247
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,490
Lu Ping and Yan Xifan had a big quarrel. They didn't leave each other on happy terms.

248
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:46,199
Lu Ping didn't even see Zhai Rong. Yan Xifan drove him out of the army camp.

249
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,059
Fighting in their own nest, good! Fight!

250
00:22:50,059 --> 00:22:54,919
Just a couple of mountain villagers. They can't get anything done.

251
00:22:54,919 --> 00:22:57,580
Even our master can't forget his hatred.

252
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:02,300
These two young men surely cannot forget it easily either.

253
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,799
Don't look down on them too much.

254
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,260
This isn't the first time he's surprised Master.

255
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:11,599
They haven't attacked directly,

256
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,360
but that doesn't mean they don't have some tricks up their sleeves.

257
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:23,200
Where do you think they can attack?

258
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:31,480
The provisions camp?!

259
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:34,999
Then, right now, isn't that dangerous for us?!

260
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,600
Lin Tianyi,

261
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:41,279
you defend the north with His Highness, just in case Yan Xifan comes.

262
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:45,620
As for the provisions camp, I'll protect it myself.

263
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:41,899
Why isn't there a single person here? Has Jin become a ghost town?

264
00:24:41,899 --> 00:24:44,220
Why don't you go back then?

265
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:47,580
We're already here, we can only move forward.

266
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,099
Hurry, let's make our move. The sooner we start, the faster we get out of here.

267
00:26:02,099 --> 00:26:03,460
Wait a minute.

268
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,440
Something's not right.

269
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:40,000
It is not a real fire. It's an illusion made by the Pneuma of Essence.

270
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,300
At a time like this, who would be playing in the city of Jin?

271
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,240
This isn't good.

272
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,720
Retreat!

273
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:30,920
Since you're already here, then die here.

274
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:12,499
General Yan, why didn't you attack directly?

275
00:30:12,499 --> 00:30:16,479
Why are we going through the northern valley to get there? Can we really get Jin back this way?

276
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:21,900
There's no other way. We can only wait.

277
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,420
Wait for what?

278
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,000
On my order, Agile Dragon Army!

279
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,040
Set up the defense!

280
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,579
It's good that you've come. I was afraid you wouldn't come!

281
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:58,619
Yan Xifan, you purposely led your men to go around from the north.

282
00:30:58,619 --> 00:31:04,519
Did you think that by playing such tricks and using such low strategies to attract our attention, Lu Ping would have more time?

283
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:08,380
You really did put in a lot of effort before

284
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:11,900
on that act you put on in front of the army camp.

285
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:15,839
Hold the defense. Lu Ping and the others should have entered Jin by now.

286
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:19,680
As long as they can burn the provisions, then the Dan Army can only retreat.

287
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:24,060
You don't really think that we fell for your trap, did you?

288
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:26,120
What have you done to Lu Ping?

289
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:31,120
Master Yan will treat him well.

290
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:35,460
As for taking care of you, that's what I'm responsible for.

291
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:48,720
General Yan, you should find this place very familiar.

292
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,900
Xifan.

293
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:18,400
That year, in this valley, you watched me kill your brother.

294
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,759
Back then, you were frozen in fear, didn't dare make a move.

295
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,359
Now the past has repeated itself. Don't you find it interesting?

296
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:30,900
Back then I couldn't save my brother,

297
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:35,180
but I may save him today.

298
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,039
What a joke. Attack!

299
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,480
Looks like they don't need us!

300
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:41,059
Wen Rui, hold the position, I will go find Xifan.

301
00:33:41,059 --> 00:33:42,640
Be careful!

302
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:05,180
Are the Force Eaters our tails? Why do they go wherever we go?

303
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:08,440
Can they just let us get away cleanly?

304
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,400
They can use six forces.

305
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:14,730
Even if we make the smallest sound, their Pneuma of Sound can hear us.

306
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:17,750
No matter where we go, they'll find us.

307
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:23,579
What about the medicine? Can't it block the Pneuma of Strength? Then they won't be as strong.

308
00:34:23,579 --> 00:34:26,230
We used a lot at that fake granary back there, there isn't much left now.

309
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:30,770
It may not be enough to deal with them. We have to keep some.

310
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,810
But the problem is that we only have one Lu Ping.

311
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:37,529
Each of them is a Lu Ping. How can we defeat them?

312
00:34:37,529 --> 00:34:41,299
What are you afraid of? My brother can beat them all.

313
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:45,820
I agree. Even Lu Ping has his drawbacks.

314
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:49,020
The Force Eaters must have their flaws, too.

315
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:52,160
They share the same heartbeat.

316
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,260
Speak louder.

317
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:57,350
I mean... the heartbeat.

318
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:03,440
What Jin Qi is trying to say is that the Force Eaters heartbeats are all the same.

319
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,740
It's like they're puppets, without any emotions.

320
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:10,660
That's right. The Mountain and Sea Gang have always been suspicious.

321
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:13,220
If each of the Force Eaters can all use six pneumas,

322
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:16,100
except for their loyal servant, like Situ Luo,

323
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:19,279
the gang must be controlling them by using the Pneuma of Essence.

324
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,360
So that they can't escape and have to fight to their death.

325
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:30,160
If they're puppets, then someone has to be controlling the strings.

326
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,820
It must be Yan Jin.

327
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,020
The sound of a zither?

328
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:50,699
I remembered that when they just showed up, there was a strange sound of a zither.

329
00:35:50,699 --> 00:35:52,900
But I'm not sure why, I can't hear it anymore.

330
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:58,399
It must be Yan Jin, using the Pneuma of Strength to secretly send the sound to manipulate them.

331
00:35:58,399 --> 00:36:00,840
That way we can't hear it.

332
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:06,220
He must be where the real provisions camp is.

333
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:09,679
But if we can't hear the sound, how do we know what direction it's in?

334
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,040
Then, how do we find him?

335
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,020
Since they can send the transmission to the Force Easters,

336
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:18,140
then can't we just use the Pneuma of Essence to read their consciousnesses?

337
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,420
Where are you?

338
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,400
I found him.

339
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:26,719
We are here. Yan Jin is here. The Force Eaters are listening to the sound of his zither.

340
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:30,360
If he is killed, those Force Easters will naturally be defeated.

341
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:36,519
That's easy to say, but we have to get out of the temple first. The medicine at the door will lose its effects soon.

342
00:37:36,519 --> 00:37:40,440
Lu Ping, I think this is going to be a bit difficult.

343
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:45,640
If we can't kill Yan Jin, everyone will be killed by the Mountain and Sea Gang.

344
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:50,020
Either we try it, or we die. I think it's an easy choice.

345
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:55,259
Brother, even if you are an Awakener, you can't deal with so many people.

346
00:37:55,259 --> 00:37:57,559
Su Tang, I have taught you before.

347
00:37:57,559 --> 00:38:01,660
If we want to live, what is the safest way to kill our enemy?

348
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:04,380
Attack in a pincer movement, from both the front and back, catch them off guard.

349
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:10,660
So I have an idea. I can use Pneuma of Sound to interfere with the sound of Yan Jin's zither.

350
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:13,720
We can attract all the Force Eaters to this location.

351
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:17,140
Everyone, please buy me at least two hours.

352
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:22,139
We can take this opportunity. Su Tang can go to the back of the camp without being noticed by the Force Eaters.

353
00:38:22,139 --> 00:38:25,519
At that time, I'll get Yan Jin's attention.

354
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,380
You take this opportunity to get in place.

355
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:31,640
Catch them off guard and attack them.

356
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,880
And kill Yan Jin together.

357
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:40,599
But if Su Tang goes out, won't her footsteps be detected by the Force Eaters. How can she get to the back of the camp?

358
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:44,660
She can use the Pneuma of Energy to stay soundless.

359
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:48,240
This way we can escape Yan Jin's and the Force Eaters Pneuma of Sound.

360
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:52,800
Elder Guo Wushu is the master of the Pneuma of Energy in Big Dipper.

361
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:57,580
They all said that talented masters produce talented disciples. He's only got you as a disciple.

362
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:01,199
I haven't learned enough. My skills aren't half of what my Master's are.

363
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:05,439
Your idea is too dangerous. What if you become their target.

364
00:39:05,439 --> 00:39:08,900
Because it's that dangerous, I have to be the one to do it.

365
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,560
You're afraid?

366
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:18,319
Sister Qin said that Prince Wei can definitely become a man with an indomitable spirit.

367
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,260
She will watch over you.

368
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,800
If I die, I die. For Sangsang, I will die gracefully.

369
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:33,060
It's not so easy to die. Zimu.

370
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:41,120
Here, for you. Ignite it if you are in danger.

371
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:45,100
We'll... all come to save you.

372
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:52,200
Su Tang, this is the last bit of powder.

373
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:55,800
Whether we live or die, it all depends on this one move.

374
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:59,060
We can only live, no dying.

375
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:07,240
Only live, no dying.

376
00:42:55,880 --> 00:43:01,800
[Ending OST: "The Paper Boat"]
[by Zhiqian Xue — Singers: Zhiqian Xue and Kewei Yu]

377
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:07,970
♫ Waiting to be buried by the lake in the town, ♫

378
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:14,100
♫ the White Paper Boat drifting with sorrow ♫

379
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:19,800
♫ Lights on the other side of the sea ♫

380
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:28,340
♫ punched fingertips in the red water tower ♫

381
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:37,880
♫ Watch the little boat churning, laughing at the ordinariness ♫

382
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:42,200
♫ Like a kite being pulled into a low altitude, ♫

383
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:47,620
♫ I smiled to the leaving person ♫

384
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:52,000
♫ The more spotlight, the more vivid the story ♫

385
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,890
♫ Laughing like the moon, ♫

386
00:43:56,890 --> 00:44:01,400
♫ regretting the lighthouse broke in the waves, ♫

387
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:08,820
♫ I call the Milky Way that isolates us all blue ♫

388
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:16,100
♫ Like a moat built under the sea, ♫

389
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:20,870
♫ waiting for the words on the paper boat to disappear, ♫

390
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:28,540
♫ there must always be someone who doesn’t
remember listening to the other ♫

391
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:35,500
♫ Anyone who is correctly guessed will end in disfavor ♫

392
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:39,750
♫ You are particularly touched but others consider it ordinary ♫

393
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:45,000
♫ Like the author, roughly put down with a weak stroke, ♫

394
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,440
♫ the writing boat on the lake was just like
a paper crane in the air ♫

395
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:54,300
♫ Laughing like the moon, ♫

396
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:59,000
♫ regretting the lighthouse broke in the waves, ♫

397
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:07,080
♫ I call the Milky Way that isolates us all blue ♫

398
00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:14,000
♫ Can a moat be built on the seabed?  ♫

399
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,270
♫ Wipe all the words on the paper boat! ♫

400
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:25,550
♫ Please let someone not remember and don't tell another! ♫

401
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:32,820
♫ Hide the reluctance between words ♫

402
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:37,400
♫ Unfortunately, I (you) am (are) an average author ♫

403
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:45,370
♫ No matter how you (I) describe the rest, it's unnecessary! ♫

404
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:55,900
♫ Don't describe my unfulfilled promise! ♫

405
00:45:55,900 --> 00:46:04,800
♫ Don't interpret my hidden fire-smoke! ♫

406
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:13,700
♫ Don't let the paper boat in the rough wave chasing me! ♫

407
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:22,020
♫ Don't wait until it's over to know there are you and me! ♫
