00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,950
♫ The dark green sea is hazy ♫

3
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:32,800
♫ dissipating in a flash ♫

4
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,660
♫ Rivers and lakes divide the world ♫

5
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,100
♫ Ten thousands arrows are firing at once ♫

6
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,970
♫ Who has time to worry? Who loves the color of blood? ♫

7
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:47,700
♫ At that time, spirits are high ♫

8
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,670
♫ Who calls the world his home?
Who dares let his horse freely run? ♫

9
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:54,400
♫ Silently, tears form in the death of night ♫

10
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,230
♫ Heroes are cutting all ties, ♫

11
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,100
♫ giving up whether it's life or death, ♫

12
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,220
♫ never asking what the cost is ♫

13
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:09,900
♫ Good and evil must be distinguished ♫

14
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,780
♫ The wind blows off the snow ♫

15
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:17,580
♫ On the body, etch multiple scars, ♫

16
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,800
♫ wandering all over the world, ♫

17
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:25,210
♫ only wish to ask for answers from this world ♫

18
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:29,200
♫ A teenager doesn't have to be a hero ♫

19
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,130
♫ There is no need for flowers in the dream ♫

20
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:35,300
♫ Destiny need not be afraid ♫

21
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:40,680
♫ Because you have him all the way, ♫

22
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,700
♫ experienced a handful of conquests, ♫

23
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,620
♫ overcame a number of challenges ♫

24
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,670

[Episode 47]

29
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,941
Ziyan!

30
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,361
Xifan!

31
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,061
Xifan!

32
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,321
Xifan!

33
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:07,799
Xifan. Go! Go!

34
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,481
Xifan.

35
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,261
Don't look down on our Yan Family's sword.

36
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,021
Dead? How could they just die?

37
00:06:21,021 --> 00:06:24,799
Didn't they say the Force Eaters can't be beaten by anyone? We're screwed then!

38
00:06:24,799 --> 00:06:28,759
Do you rely on the Master for everything? How about the soldiers you brought?! Fight!

39
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:56,341
If we can only rely on the pugilist world in the war, then where is the prestige of the Imperial Court?

40
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,281
Where is my prestige?

41
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,711
The Agile Dragon Army has this place surrounded already.

42
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,761
Full attack!

43
00:07:09,761 --> 00:07:17,209
Kill them!

44
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,299
Your Majesty, I have another presumptuous request.

45
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:31,161
I will take over the Agile Dragon Army from this moment onward.

46
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,041
If you want to go to Jin to rescue people, just go.

47
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:43,201
But remember to bring Lu Ping back.

48
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,740
Yes.

49
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,021
Xifan!

50
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,299
Go and find Yan Jin. Hurry!

51
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,780
Are you all right?

52
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:12,941
Stay away from me. You're covered in sweat. Hurry, go and help!

53
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,400
Go.

54
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:53,039
Remember. I can only hold on for two hours at most.

55
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:58,019
If you don't make it in time, I'm afraid none of us will walk out of Jin City alive.

56
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:34,639
What's wrong?

57
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,900
My leg went numb.

58
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,279
Why didn't you say so?

59
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,421
I thought I could make it.

60
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,899
Are you all right? I am fine.

61
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,119
Su Tang, let's call for help.

62
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,500
To ask for help means we're to die here together.

63
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,959
Wei Tianqi, do you really want my brother to look down on you for his entire life?

64
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,620
What a joke. I'm the first chief disciple of the Chan State Martial Arts School.

65
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:31,220
How can I lose to a wild brat from the Wind Taker Academy?

66
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,650
Let's go.

67
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:50,660
- Who said I'd be in trouble if I left you?
- You've never let me down before.

68
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:56,399
When did you two arrange to put on this act? How come I didn't know?

69
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,569
During the day, put on an act with me in front of the army camp.

70
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:22,119
At present, Yan Jin is stationed in Jin with the army of Force Eaters.

71
00:13:22,119 --> 00:13:25,541
If we want to seize Jin, we must take the provisions camp.

72
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:28,359
I'll lead my troops to the northern valley and distract some Force Eaters,

73
00:13:28,359 --> 00:13:30,960
and create an opportunity for you to enter the city.

74
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:35,199
Lu Ping, although you and I are separated by the pugilist world and the Imperial Court,

75
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:37,361
can we work together one more time?

76
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,879
Then, when did you two plan it secretly? Why didn't you tell me?

77
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:48,121
You have such a big mouth. How could I?

78
00:13:48,121 --> 00:13:51,499
I have big mouth? Come on. Tell me. Do I have a big mouth?

79
00:13:51,499 --> 00:13:55,279
Xiaomei, tell me. You are the one. Say it.

80
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,660
We've worked together so many times, our tacit understanding keeps getting better and better.

81
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:05,341
Isn't it all because you're a good teacher? What's that saying? Disciples of Wind Taker.

82
00:14:05,341 --> 00:14:07,311
No one can fall behind.

83
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,580
And Mo Lin.

84
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,781
So even more so that we can't let go of the Mountain and Sea Gang.

85
00:14:12,781 --> 00:14:18,461
Two hours have almost passed. Senior, it's time to go.

86
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,801
Make it clean.

87
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:49,981
Do you remember the Pneuma Combat Convention? The Pneuma of Sound tested melody.

88
00:14:49,981 --> 00:14:52,701
I almost disgraced Wind Taker.

89
00:14:52,701 --> 00:14:58,520
When facing the formidable enemy, I don't think it's a good time to recall the past.

90
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:02,521
I only want to say, from that day onward,

91
00:15:02,521 --> 00:15:07,201
anyone playing the zither again makes me very upset.

92
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:08,261
I really didn't think highly enough of you two.

93
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:12,061
I never thought you'd make it all the way here.

94
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:18,419
What a pity though. In the end, you still failed.

95
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:23,579
You were playing so hard, how could we not come to applaud it?

96
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:25,561
I'm just a layman.

97
00:17:25,561 --> 00:17:29,261
Your elegant music is not as interesting as my metals.

98
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,221
Am I right, Senior?

99
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:37,460
Facing death, and you're still this happy?

100
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:41,860
Fine. Then let me gift you this one last song.

101
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,211
Lu Ping.

102
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:34,071
You've forgotten the hatred of your parents and your masters.

103
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:38,241
You are disloyal and unfilial.

104
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,961
Now you are helping the tyrant.

105
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:52,011
You will be cursed by others

106
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,541
and abandoned by the world.

107
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,510
You're wrong.

108
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:07,681
I am not helping my foe but the common people.

109
00:19:07,681 --> 00:19:13,221
Only when we let go of hatred can we have a world in our hearts.

110
00:19:13,221 --> 00:19:15,061
Right, Senior.?

111
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,961
Master,

112
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,761
I...

113
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,951
can't be with you anymore.

114
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,399
Are you all right?

115
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,731
I am not all right. My legs are sore.

116
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:23,399
Brother, is it over now?

117
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:29,711
The provisions camp has been burned. The Dan Army has been surrounded by Zhai Rong outside the city.

118
00:20:29,711 --> 00:20:34,970
As long as he leads the army to attack on time, we can get Jin City back.

119
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:40,379
Yan Xifan, now you have military exploits. You can get a promotion and get rich, right?

120
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:45,601
This time it's all thanks to you, Senior Brother.

121
00:20:45,601 --> 00:20:50,840
No matter if it's in the Imperial Court or the pugilist world, you are still a Senior Brother of Wind Taker.

122
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,201
You can't stay here long. Leave Jin City as soon as possible.

123
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,460
Why should he leave? You just solved the problem of Jin.

124
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:03,699
You should be a hero of Shuo. Why should you leave?

125
00:21:03,699 --> 00:21:06,679
Yan Xifan, is it because you want to take all the credit?

126
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,881
He's not.

127
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,660
At the time, we killed Wen Gecheng and made great contributions.

128
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,500
Wind Taker was also destroyed because of that.

129
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,599
It's hard to guess the mind of His Majesty.

130
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:26,660
In his eyes, there's only two types of people.

131
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:31,261
His men and his enemies. Lu Ping tried to assassinate His Majesty.

132
00:21:31,261 --> 00:21:33,751
He will never be able to enter the court.

133
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:40,840
It's better to leave the muddy waters as soon as possible rather than turn against His Majesty.

134
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:54,001
I will welcome His Majesty in person at the gate, to buy you some time.

135
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:02,020
Lu Ping, we shall meet again someday.

136
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,979
General, the Dan Army has been defeated by us. There are a few remnant soldiers.

137
00:23:06,979 --> 00:23:08,080
Continue searching.

138
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,480
Yes.

139
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,539
Your Majesty, a fire broke out in the Dan Army's provisions camp.

140
00:23:15,539 --> 00:23:18,499
Their provisions have been burned. The Force Eaters have also lost the one manipulating them.

141
00:23:18,499 --> 00:23:21,719
They are no longer a threat to us. The Dan Army has already been evacuated.

142
00:23:21,719 --> 00:23:25,661
The Agile Dragon Army can't remove their armor. Attack the city.

143
00:23:25,661 --> 00:23:30,601
If you meet anyone who can use six pneumas, kill them all, no exceptions.

144
00:23:30,601 --> 00:23:32,341
Don't leave any alive.

145
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:41,361
I am confused. Lu Ping can use the six pneumas as well. Your Majesty, please make it clear.

146
00:23:41,361 --> 00:23:46,181
General Wen, do you not understand the words "no exceptions"?

147
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,860
I accept the order.

148
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:04,320
We went down the mountain to be heroes, why are we returning so dejected and depressed?

149
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,459
As long as we have a clear conscience that's enough. Here, let me pat the dust off for you.

150
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:15,319
I will welcome His Majesty at the gate in person. Buy some time for you.

151
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:20,880
Lu Ping, we shall meet again someday.

152
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,440
Brother, are you still worrying about Senior Brother?

153
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,740
I am the criminal who once tried to assassinate the emperor.

154
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:46,251
He let me go without permission. He can't help but be implicated.

155
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,651
Why don't we go with you and take a look?

156
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:56,131
I will go. You don't have to follow me.

157
00:24:56,131 --> 00:24:59,019
Lu Ping, you're always on your own.

158
00:24:59,019 --> 00:25:02,051
Do you even consider yourself a Fifth Institute disciple or not?

159
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,221
We just got Jin back. There are many people on the border who need help.

160
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:13,009
As disciples of Big Dipper and the pugilist world, we should do more to uphold justice and chivalry.

161
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,111
People need heroes.

162
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:22,401
As for the matters of the court, I'm already involved.

163
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:27,831
I can't escape or avoid it. I will finish it today.

164
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,280
Brother.

165
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,501
I won't leave Xifan alone.

166
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,819
Be at ease. They will definitely come back safely.

167
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:25,421
Zhai, you thief. I'm not going to give up.

168
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,890
You mean,

169
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:45,820
Lu Ping escaped?

170
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:49,460
Yes.

171
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,981
You really don't know where he's going?

172
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:10,441
Yan Xifan, I remember I told you.

173
00:27:10,441 --> 00:27:17,321
As an emperor, I will never allow any pieces on the board that I can't control.

174
00:27:17,321 --> 00:27:20,461
But you still obstinately persist in going about things the wrong way.

175
00:27:20,461 --> 00:27:24,011
You really failed my expectations and wasted my desire to promote you.

176
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,441
I am willing to be punished.

177
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:49,919
Your Majesty, Lu Ping is walking towards Jin.

178
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,210
[Jin City]

179
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:23,139
Your Majesty, I would like to guarantee for Lu Ping. I'm willing to trade all my credits for his life.

180
00:28:23,139 --> 00:28:26,600
Xifan, you are not a part of the pugilist world.

181
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:31,479
You are a general of Shuo. Your life and your contributions were all given by me.

182
00:28:31,479 --> 00:28:33,020
Wen Rui!

183
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,640
Your Majesty.

184
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,041
Wen Rui.

185
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:00,579
Your Majesty! Please, I beg you!

186
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,161
You've been kneeling here for four hours.

187
00:30:04,161 --> 00:30:08,860
Your Majesty, I have only one request.

188
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:15,141
You two are indeed brothers.

189
00:30:15,141 --> 00:30:18,371
One is lucky. Another is bold.

190
00:30:18,371 --> 00:30:20,781
You've never respected me.

191
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:25,741
Fine. I know what your request is.

192
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,100
Your Majesty.

193
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:38,591
Since ancient times, loyalty and filial piety have been hard to achieve. I have already lost my father.

194
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,461
I don't want to lose my brother.

195
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:46,940
Moreover, if we don't get rid of Liu Song,

196
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:51,999
the Mountain and Sea Gang will be a centipede which will never topple over even when dead. There will be no end to the troubles.

197
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:57,121
If I don't finish this, I will never be at peace.

198
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,800
Your Majesty, please fulfill my wish.

199
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:05,960
Fine. You can go as you wish.

200
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:10,321
But you better have thought this through. Now that the war is over,

201
00:31:10,321 --> 00:31:14,261
if you go, you won't have any support.

202
00:31:14,261 --> 00:31:18,451
No military merit, no chance for regret.

203
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:23,381
Whether you win or fail, live or die, have honor or disgrace,

204
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:25,661
Shuo will have nothing to do with any of it.

205
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:30,491
Thank you, Your Majesty.

206
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:57,530
Xifan!

207
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:10,139
I know you think I'm not skilled enough so you won't take me with you.

208
00:32:10,139 --> 00:32:13,399
But I'm really worried about you. I want to be with you.

209
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:20,020
Ziyan, this is our business.

210
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:22,761
You have more important things to do.

211
00:32:22,761 --> 00:32:25,141
What can I do?

212
00:32:25,141 --> 00:32:29,841
Jin City is still in chaos. You've always been careful.

213
00:32:29,841 --> 00:32:34,861
Only with you by His Majesty's side, can I leave at ease.

214
00:32:34,861 --> 00:32:37,931
Believe in me and believe in yourself.

215
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,891
I have never looked down on you.

216
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:50,100
Take care of His Majesty for me. Take care of yourself.

217
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,680
Wait for me.

218
00:32:56,020 --> 00:33:00,671
I'll guard the rear for you and wait for your safe return.

219
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,080
Okay.

220
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,160
I have to go.

221
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:34,259
Are you two sure? You really don't need us to go with you?

222
00:33:34,259 --> 00:33:39,479
Senior Huo Ying, two or ten won't make a difference to the Mountain and Sea Gang.

223
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:45,549
Now that the situation is beginning to stabilize, people in the city are in a panic after the chaos.

224
00:33:45,549 --> 00:33:50,939
The Agile Dragon Army is there to guard His Majesty. The people in the city still need you to comfort and protect them.

225
00:33:50,939 --> 00:33:53,530
This is what the chivalry of the Dark Walkers is worth.

226
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:57,859
On your trip this time, is it under the orders of the Imperial Court or the way of the pugilist world?

227
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:02,501
It's nothing to do with the Imperial Court or with the pugilist world.

228
00:34:02,501 --> 00:34:05,241
Only things between me and Lu Ping.

229
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,750
If fate allows it, we shall meet again someday.

230
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,101
We will meet again!

231
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:58,430
[Fifth Plain]

232
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:43,250
[Dan]

233
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:44,439
How about that thief, Zhai?

234
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:49,011
I am sorry I was incompetent. Jin City has been taken.

235
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,439
Then, why did you come back?

236
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,919
I know I am guilty and deserve to die,

237
00:35:54,920 --> 00:36:00,141
but I fought with my life to bring Lu Ping back.

238
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,381
Where is my teacher?

239
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:08,821
Master, he fell into Lu Ping's scheme

240
00:36:08,821 --> 00:36:11,021
and died in Jin City.

241
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:34,519
Master, as long as we have Force Eaters,

242
00:36:34,519 --> 00:36:39,121
the Mountain and Sea Gang's big plan is not over yet.

243
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,100
What happened to Lu Ping?

244
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:04,179
Master, Zhai hates him for the assassination attempt and tried to kill him with an arrow from the top of the city wall.

245
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:55,619
I have used the best medicine in the Mountain and Sea Gang to take care of your wound.

246
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,701
You better not let me down.

247
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,040
Come here.

248
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:26,959
Father. Mother.

249
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,799
- Where are you?
- Keep going. Go ahead.

250
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,219
- Come here.
- Ping'er.

251
00:38:30,219 --> 00:38:31,439
- Ping'er.
- Ping'er.

252
00:38:31,439 --> 00:38:33,869
Do you hear my voice? Come find your dad.

253
00:38:33,869 --> 00:38:37,020
Ping'er. Ping'er.

254
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,959
- Guess who am I?
- Master Chu Min.

255
00:38:38,959 --> 00:38:40,659
- Ping'er.
- Ping'er.

256
00:38:40,659 --> 00:38:42,159
- Ping'er. Here.
- Where are you?

257
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,860
- Ping'er. Here. Here.
- Here.

258
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,460
Ping'er. Come here.

259
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:54,459
I got you. Let me see who it is.

260
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:57,401
Who are you?

261
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:13,299
Ping'er, today, you are officially part of the Wind Taker Academy.

262
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:18,080
Youdao, take the silver.

263
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:21,001
Repair your broken wall.

264
00:39:21,001 --> 00:39:26,599
I have wine and silver. Why should I repair the wall?

265
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:29,481
Ping'er, hurry and pay your respects to the master.

266
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,681
Ping'er, greets the master.

267
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:42,981
It's not real. It's not real.

268
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,871
Isn't everything perfect?

269
00:39:57,871 --> 00:40:01,651
If Zhai hadn't attacked Big Dipper that year,

270
00:40:01,651 --> 00:40:04,821
this should've been what your life was like.

271
00:40:04,821 --> 00:40:08,391
Your friends, family, lover.

272
00:40:08,391 --> 00:40:10,741
You wouldn't have lost any of them.

273
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,681
None of this is real.

274
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:18,781
It's just an illusion created by the Pneuma of Essence.

275
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,950
As long as you want it,

276
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,970
you can be reunited with what you've missed.

277
00:40:25,971 --> 00:40:28,521
Those you've lost can come back.

278
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:49,439
Bandit, why are you so nervous?

279
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,561
Will you come with me somewhere?

280
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:29,079
Bandit, why are your eyes red?

281
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:38,001
If only you were real.

282
00:41:38,001 --> 00:41:43,279
What are you talking about? We are here. It's real.

283
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:51,579
You haven't answered me yet. Do I look good in this dress?

284
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:00,161
Might as well be happy for once.

285
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,740
As long as you're here,

286
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:07,100
then this is reality.

287
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:25,411
What heroic spirit! It can't even stand up to such insignificant, ordinary thoughts.

288
00:42:25,411 --> 00:42:30,080
Lu Ping, you want to be an ordinary person.

289
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,590
I can give that to you.

290
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:37,640
Will you give me what I want?

291
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:04,580

313
00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:16,680
♫ Can a moat be built on the seabed? ♫

314
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:21,100
♫ Wipe all the words on the paper boat! ♫

315
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:28,620
♫ Please let someone not remember and don't tell another! ♫

316
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:35,600
♫ Hide the reluctance between words ♫

317
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:40,300
♫ Unfortunately, I (you) am (are) an average author ♫

318
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:47,770
♫ No matter how you (I) describe the rest, it's unnecessary! ♫

319
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:58,700
♫ Don't describe my unfulfilled promise! ♫

320
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:07,500
♫ Don't interpret my hidden fire-smoke! ♫

321
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:16,500
♫ Don't let the paper boat in the rough wave chasing me! ♫

322
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:24,980
♫ Don't wait until it's over to know there are you and me! ♫
