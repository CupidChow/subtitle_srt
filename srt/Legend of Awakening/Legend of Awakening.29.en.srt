00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:28,930
♫ The dark green sea is hazy ♫

3
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:32,840
♫ dissipating in a flash. ♫

4
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,570
♫ Rivers and lakes divide the world. ♫

5
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,920
♫ Ten thousands arrows are firing at once. ♫

6
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,970
♫ Who has time to worry? Who loves the color of blood? ♫

7
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:47,810
♫ At that time, spirits are high. ♫

8
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:51,620
♫ Who calls the world his home? Who dares let his horse freely run? ♫

9
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:54,370
♫ Silently, tears form in the death of night. ♫

10
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:58,260
♫ Heroes are cutting all ties, ♫

11
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,070
♫ giving up whether it's life or death, ♫

12
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,240
♫ never asking what the cost is. ♫

13
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:09,870
♫ Good and evil must be distinguished. ♫

14
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:13,750
♫ The wind blows off the snow. ♫

15
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:17,620
♫ On the body, etch multiple scars, ♫

16
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,730
♫ wandering all over the world, ♫

17
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:25,220
♫ only wish to ask for answers from this world. ♫

18
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:29,250
♫ A teenager doesn't have to be a hero. ♫

19
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,120
♫ There is no need for flowers in the dream. ♫

20
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,220
♫ Destiny need not be afraid. ♫

21
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:40,860
♫ Because you have him all the way, ♫

22
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,700
♫ experienced a handful of conquests, ♫

23
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,560

[ Legend of Awakening ]

28
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,710
[ Episode 29 ]

29
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,580
Xifan, during the Seven Star Convention,

30
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,370
you have to get close to the masters of all sects.

31
00:02:29,379 --> 00:02:33,820
Everyone, please look after him in the future.

32
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,520
It is not Wuji Manor here.

33
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,140
Why is he behaving like the host here?

34
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:41,480
He really doesn't have any sense of shame.

35
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,179
Isn't that Lu Ping? Lu Ping!

36
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:55,060
Escort the sect masters inside immediately.

37
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,480
Sect Masters, this way, please!

38
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,979
- Please.
- After you.

39
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,940
Lu Ping, Lu Ping, why did you get here so late?

40
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,690
The masters who have received the Seven Star invitation have all arrived already.

41
00:03:13,699 --> 00:03:16,079
As the saying goes, "Even heroes fall for beauties."

42
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,379
Did you meet a girl at the foot of the mountain and was reluctant to leave?

43
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:21,780
I have something urgent to report to our pavilion master.

44
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,700
Let's go.

45
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,260
[Big Dipper Pavilion]

46
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:35,020
The Big Dipper... cooperates with the imperial court?

47
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:38,660
You even brought the Seven Star invitation... to the palace?

48
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,880
Master, there are more pressing matters at hand.

49
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,359
No one will think you're mute if you don't talk!

50
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,090
Pavilion Master, being confronted with such a formidable enemy,

51
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:48,620
why is there a reason to draw such a clear line between the puglist world and the imperial court?

52
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:52,900
Lu Ping, we will surely be restricted by the court if we cooperate with them.

53
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,779
I have discussed with Manor Master Yan and everything has already been prepared.

54
00:03:55,779 --> 00:03:58,420
We will be able destroy the Mountain and Sea Gang just by ourselves.

55
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,080
Aren't you just afraid again?

56
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,239
You… This is a big deal!

57
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:07,420
Pavilion Master, what the Mountain and Sea Gang wants is not from the puglist world.

58
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:11,800
No matter how unwilling you are, the Big Dipper cannot survive on its own.

59
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,900
I will report to His Majesty first.

60
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,960
I hope you can come to a decision soon.

61
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,460
Lu Ping! Lu Ping.

62
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:42,439
- I was delayed by something just now. I was afraid you had left already.
- What a coincidence!

63
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:44,799
I just finished my business. I'm leaving.

64
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,100
Lu Ping, how are Qin Sang's injuries?

65
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,219
Don't worry! She is fine.

66
00:04:51,219 --> 00:04:52,640
Then...

67
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,520
Don't you want to know about Su Tang?

68
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,660
Mo Lin saw that she was depressed so he took her to Yuezhou to cheer her up.

69
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,780
Might as well! I feel relieved.

70
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,620
- Lu Ping.
- I haven't seen you for only a few days.

71
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,040
Eldest Senior, why are you being so wordy?

72
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,530
I didn't think things through well before.

73
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,780
How about we practice and drink together sometime?

74
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:22,230
There are many people who want to drink with me so I don't need to trouble Eldest Senior.

75
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:25,310
- We can talk about it later.
- Young Hero Xifan.

76
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,380
Eldest Senior, you're very busy. Goodbye!

77
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,010
Don't worry, Young Hero Xifan.

78
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:39,270
Think about it carefully! What did Lu Ping call you just now?

79
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,540
Eldest Senior?

80
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:46,300
Last time you quarreled, he was still calling you Young Master Yan.

81
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,620
You are not the only one who needs face.

82
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,520
Have we invited a sect with all women?

83
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,050
Maybe some sects recruited some new female disciples.

84
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:04,010
We might have not known about it.

85
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,160
You've been working so hard these past few days.

86
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,510
Why don't you go back early and rest?

87
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,380
What are you doing here by the river instead of going back to the Big Dipper?

88
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:38,280
Master, actually, I tricked you into going down the mountain.

89
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,900
What do you want to do?

90
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,240
Hold this! Wait for a while.

91
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,340
Master, Xu Weifeng died in this river that day.

92
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:05,840
I originally planned on paying respect to him with you along the river,

93
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,780
Who knew it would rain and got the paper money all wet.

94
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:14,259
Master, don't be sad!

95
00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:16,640
He made a huge mistake.

96
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:20,400
Let's forget about him together. Okay?

97
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,080
Okay.

98
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:39,239
Xu Weifeng, we got to know each other.

99
00:07:39,239 --> 00:07:42,280
I hope you will be good in the next life.

100
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,780
Xu Weifeng?

101
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:30,120
Weifeng! Weifeng!

102
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,349
Darn it! Why are you still alive?

103
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,880
We all saw you jump into the river.

104
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:41,480
How did you stay alive?

105
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,459
I was washed downstream.

106
00:08:43,459 --> 00:08:47,800
I didn't die but the world is so big,

107
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,920
I don't want to be a lonely ghost in a strange land

108
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,720
so I escaped all the way back here.

109
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,659
If you wanted to die, then you should've just died.

110
00:08:55,659 --> 00:08:57,740
Master is already upset enough as it is.

111
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:02,150
You came back to life and keep showing up, you'll only torture her to death.

112
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:06,060
Anyway, my insignificant life,

113
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,240
initially, I was going to redeem it for her.

114
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,120
Right, Su Tang?

115
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,920
[Pure Wind Courtyard]

116
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,220
Master.

117
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,140
Look after him! I'll go find a doctor for him.

118
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:38,700
Master, he is ungrateful and vicious.

119
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,120
Even if you're kind, there should be a limit.

120
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,319
There is greater merit in saving one life than in building a seven-tier pagoda.

121
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,200
He saved Bao Niang and the others that day.

122
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,779
Let Bao Niang save his life then. What does it have to do with you?

123
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:52,240
All I know is that this guy not only lied to you, but also harmed Lu Ping.

124
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,340
Maybe he has information on the Mountain and Sea Gang.

125
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:00,450
Mo Lin, give him one more chance.

126
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:02,880
It's a human life after all.

127
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,300
Master,

128
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,980
you didn't ask the good doctor who is right here.

129
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:16,279
Do you want the whole Yuezhou to know that you are hiding a wanted fugitive?

130
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:17,980
You're willing to save him?

131
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,900
Lucky for you, Pretty Boy!

132
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,340
Earlier, when Li Yaotian personally went to Yuezhou to save you,

133
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,500
I even thought he was courageous.

134
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:39,900
I didn't expect that he was also timid and overly cautious.

135
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,840
There's no precedent.

136
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:46,040
It's normal for Pavilion Master Li to have some concerns

137
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:49,780
but I'm worried about what Lu Ping said.

138
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:54,160
We don't know what Liu Song's intentions are.

139
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,300
It does make one feel uneasy.

140
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,739
Your Majesty, Pavilion Master Li of the Big Dipper sent a disciple to deliver a message.

141
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:09,879
Junior Lu Ping, the message from Pavilion Master is for Your Majesty to please come up to the mountains to have a talk.

142
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,780
What General Qin just said before was a bit early.

143
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:17,310
Master Li still has courage but it's just a bit late.

144
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:21,179
There's another message from the Pavilion Master that the masters of the other sects have no idea about this.

145
00:11:21,179 --> 00:11:23,739
Pavilion Master needs to find the right time to let them know.

146
00:11:23,739 --> 00:11:28,140
Master hopes Your Majesty will dress simply and not bring the army with you up the mountain.

147
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:31,240
Absolutely not! Your Majesty's safety is a matter of the whole kingdom.

148
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,439
What qualifications does the Big Dipper have to put His Majesty at risk?

149
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,840
That's okay!

150
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,280
I was the one who suggested this initially.

151
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:44,100
Naturally, I have to show my sincerity.

152
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:47,350
What's more? I have you and Lu Ping protecting me.

153
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:49,310
There won't be any big problems.

154
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:54,440
Then let's leave Wen Rui and the Agile Dragon Army here.

155
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,239
Your Majesty, I am willing to go with Your Majesty.

156
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,620
Besides, Brother, I miss Senior Huo Ying and the others.

157
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:50,919
Master Yan came to the convention but we are the ones who have to work hard.

158
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:54,600
I can't tell whether the Masters are here for a convention or for recreation.

159
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,740
They've brought so many things.

160
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:00,340
We still have so many things to move to the dome of the Astronomical Observatory

161
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:03,220
It's really dirty and tiring.

162
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:09,960
Little White, look! I don't even have the strength to hold you now.

163
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:15,100
We don't even know what will happen when the Seven Star Convention actually starts.

164
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:20,300
How about... how about we say that Master Chu Min passed out after drinking too much?

165
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,720
That way we can say we have to stay and take care of her.

166
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,680
Otherwise, we'll be half dead after the Seven Star Convention.

167
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:38,279
- Where are the 20 jars of wine?
- Used to entertain guests so there is no wine left.

168
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:40,600
Hurry up and find some.

169
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,440
It's fine.

170
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:47,320
Don't bother! I am bored.

171
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,880
Want to play mahjong?

172
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:55,039
That shouldn't be good.

173
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:56,980
It's okay if we play with each other.

174
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:00,060
She is the master of Yaoguang Peak so how are we supposed to play with her?

175
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:04,639
Whatever! There's a meeting over there to discuss how to deal with her former lover.

176
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,959
Even if Master Chu Min burn down the pavilion, Pavilion Master will not blame her, as long as she's happy.

177
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,220
Okay. Over there.

178
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,780
Peak Master Chu.

179
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,380
Pavilion Master invites you to go to the dome with all seniors and juniors of the Fifth Institute.

180
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:20,010
Master has something important to discuss about the Seven Star Convention.

181
00:14:20,019 --> 00:14:24,019
What? Did I hear right? One, two, three, four, five. The Fifth Institute?

182
00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:28,259
How can I mishear the order of the Pavilion Master? Please come with me now.

183
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,080
The Pavilion Master is provoking our Master.

184
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,620
Is it because he wants to use the history between her and Liu Song at the convention,

185
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:39,390
so he invited us over?

186
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,170
No matter what he wants,

187
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:47,480
we have to give face to the leader.

188
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,180
Let's go.

189
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,720
Go, go, go!

190
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,400
Master Chu Min seems to be going crazy again.

191
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,280
He is not a disciple of Big Dipper.

192
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,660
Indeed! He is from the Mountain and Sea Gang.

193
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:25,579
Master, when did you realize he was from the Mountain and Sea Gang?

194
00:15:25,579 --> 00:15:29,660
When you were carrying things up to the dome, I already felt that something was not right.

195
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:33,819
There are countless stars of destiny in the dome, even Li Yaotian didn't escape in time.

196
00:15:33,819 --> 00:15:38,039
Moreover, the dome was destroyed by Lu Ping's connecting star to destiny a while ago.

197
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:40,100
We didn't even have time to repair it.

198
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:43,839
Li Yaotian values his reputation as much as his life.

199
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:47,000
How could he have the Seven Star Convention there?

200
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,340
So that means either Li Yaotian's temperament has changed greatly,

201
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:54,199
or this guy is a fake.

202
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,180
What if you were wrong?

203
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,719
Senior Huo Ying, there is blood on the lantern.

204
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:23,559
People from Mountain and Sea Gang have already infiltrated the Big Dipper but they haven't taken action yet.

205
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:27,740
Today, apart from the masters coming to the mountain, what else happened?

206
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,579
Lu Ping. It's Lu Ping. Lu Ping came back in a hurry and met the master.

207
00:16:31,579 --> 00:16:35,979
After their secret talk, Lu Ping went down the mountain in a hurry. He seemed to go and met someone.

208
00:16:35,979 --> 00:16:40,660
Oh no! The Big Dipper is too careless this time. The Mountain and Sea Gang is plotting a big conspiracy.

209
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:43,959
You all go and inform Li Yaotian while I shall go down the mountain.

210
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:30,820
I'm quite lucky today to be able to catch the Zhai traitor.

211
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,519
This is not good! Something might've happened in the Big Dipper.

212
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,180
Retreat to the bottom of the mountain.

213
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,460
It's rare!

214
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,080
It's rare that Your Majesty is alone.

215
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,940
You have no idea how long I've been waiting for this chance.

216
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:06,080
how long I've been waiting for this chance.

217
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,220
Whoever dare moves, I'll kill him.

218
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,860
It has been so many years.

219
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:32,280
You still can surprise me.

220
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,900
Let them go!

221
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,800
- Master Chu Min.
- I don't need my disciple to worry about me.

222
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,560
Protect the people you should protect.

223
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,240
Go now!

224
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,880
Let's go.

225
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:36,080
I didn't expect that after so many years

226
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,140
we would meet like this.

227
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,399
This is a shortcut for the disciples of the Big Dipper to go down the mountain to buy stuff.

228
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:53,030
It's unknown to a lot of people.

229
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:56,460
If successfully make it down the mountain, then we should end up in Yuezhou.

230
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,920
Su Tang and Mo Lin are in the city waiting for us.

231
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,040
They can heal the injury of General Qin.

232
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:04,610
No way! His Majesty is the emperor of Shuo.

233
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:06,670
It's dangerous to rush in.

234
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:10,200
We should go back to camp immediately for help.

235
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,990
General Qin,

236
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:14,380
there's no camp anymore.

237
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,260
The rest of the Agile Dragon Army in the camp

238
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,260
are all annihilated.

239
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,460
Liu Song prepared thoroughly.

240
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:32,360
I'm afraid when we went up the mountain he must have raided the camp.

241
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,520
Right now, only the four of us are left.

242
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:39,700
Your Majesty, please make your decision quickly.

243
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:46,439
Liu Song came prepared.

244
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,480
How can I wait here to die?

245
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,780
Let's fight to the death and go to Yuezhou.

246
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:03,060
You also didn't expect me to become like this.

247
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:11,440
It's a pity that you can't save them.

248
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,400
I'm afraid I won't encounter another chance

249
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,180
where Zhai Rong is alone outside again.

250
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:21,179
Zhou Youlong, don't you enjoy killing?

251
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:23,040
Here's your chance!

252
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,880
What did you do?

253
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:58,519
You had already lost when you couldn't bear to kill me the first chance you had.

254
00:21:58,519 --> 00:22:02,370
All these years, the people who want to kill me

255
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:04,510
aren't just you.

256
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:07,080
How can I be unprepared?

257
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,160
The toxin in the wheelchair is enough

258
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:13,600
to give you a good sleep.

259
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,580
Let me talk to my old friends at the Big Dipper.

260
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:36,920
After you wake up,

261
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,680
we can talk about us.

262
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:06,060
Pavilion Master Li, I don't know you've gathered everyone here

263
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,140
is for what reason?

264
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:12,000
I'm only doing this because Senior Chu Min had someone deliver me a Seven Star Token.

265
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,660
She told me to gather you all here.

266
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,830
Chu Min?

267
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:21,000
Why is she this enthusiastic?

268
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:26,260
Can I have a look at the Seven Star Token?

269
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:28,279
- Bai Li.
- Master.

270
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:36,480
[Seven Star Token]

271
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:56,220
This… How? How could there be scorched marks?

272
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:59,280
This is Liu Song's Seven Star Token.

273
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:29,300
Everyone here are masters in the martial arts of the Central Plains.

274
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,610
The Mountain and Sea Gang came here on their own.

275
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:34,380
We have to act accordingly.

276
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:43,380
Father. Father.

277
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:20,640
You put poison in the candles.

278
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,540
Young Lord Yan, watch your language!

279
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:31,200
This is something good from the Mountain and Sea Gang.

280
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,459
It's colorless and tasteless but it can cause disorder in your Pneuma of Strength.

281
00:25:35,459 --> 00:25:39,540
Everyone here are the best in martial arts.

282
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:44,820
You're the best people to be brought back for Master to use for Xi Sui.
(TN: Recall, Xi Sui = Marrow Washing)

283
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:48,059
Liu Song, it has been more than ten years since I last saw you.

284
00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:51,980
I didn't expect you to be even more vicious.

285
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:55,399
It turns out you've planned this all along.

286
00:25:55,400 --> 00:26:00,140
You were taking advantage of when the Big Dipper gathered all the sects together so you can capture all of us at once.

287
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:09,540
Second Brother, don't be so harsh.

288
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,960
It's been 19 years.

289
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:22,900
I have been pining to return here.

290
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,880
This time,

291
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,760
I want to get back what is rightfully mine.

292
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,280
- Let's go—
- Don't be rash!

293
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,520
That's dirty.

294
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,299
I've told you! There are benefits for walking slow.

295
00:26:53,299 --> 00:26:57,320
We will been done for if we go in there right now.

296
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,030
What's the difference of us being out here than being in there?

297
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:04,580
The four of us and a rabbit can't even beat Yan Qiuci. What's the use of staying out here?

298
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:08,440
I left Little White in Fifth Institute.

299
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,500
I can't worry about it right now.

300
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:17,079
That's right! We can only worry about ourselves right now.

301
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:21,220
As along as we're here, we can watch Liu Song's movements.

302
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:25,960
Let's wait for Lu Ping to come up and see if there is any other way.

303
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:35,719
We can only stay here for now.

304
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,339
Here! Change into these clothes first.

305
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,839
At the Wind Taker, we usually get new clothes only during the New Year celebration.

306
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,279
This time, for Your Majesty, we're celebrating New Years ahead of time.

307
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:49,219
Lu Ping, are you really going to let His Majesty wear such a crude thing?

308
00:27:49,219 --> 00:27:54,259
What a waste of breath! How can you blend in when you're all so well-dressed?

309
00:27:54,259 --> 00:27:58,159
From now on, the four of us came to Yuezhou to seek refuge with our relatives.

310
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:01,240
You two are my eldest and second brothers.

311
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,980
She's my wife.

312
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,860
You've overstepped your authority enough to have you beheaded ten times.

313
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:19,340
At present, we are running for our lives.

314
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:21,720
It's safer to act in plain clothes.

315
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,830
Let's just follow Lu Ping's plan.

316
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:26,779
Your Majesty, the Mountain and Sea Gang will catch up soon.

317
00:28:26,779 --> 00:28:30,839
Now, the enemy outnumbers us, so we can only win if we find support.

318
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:35,140
There are still many things to be arranged after the peace talk.

319
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:40,000
I believe that Xu Yanling must still be in Yuezhou.

320
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,580
Then I will… No!
(TN: He was referring to himself with the term that only Emperors use.)

321
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:47,999
I am going to negotiate with Xu Yanling.

322
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,180
Maybe I can get help from the Tan army.

323
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:53,920
Your Majesty, Xu Yanling is an important official of another state after all.

324
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,159
His only son was also a member of the Mountain and Sea Gang.

325
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:59,700
It's too risky to expose Your Majesty's whereabouts rashly.

326
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:02,540
Please allow me to go on your behalf.

327
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:07,479
Brother, a lot of people in Yuezhou know what you look like. Why don't you let me go?

328
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:11,420
Stop arguing on who is to go! Just let me do it.

329
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:14,460
I can ask Xu Yanling for help as a disciple of the Big Dipper.

330
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,670
I can sound out his attitude.

331
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:18,400
General Qin,

332
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:21,100
what do you think?

333
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:25,519
Brother, what's wrong?

334
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:29,119
Minor wounds. I am okay.

335
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:40,160
So leave this errand to me and my wife.

336
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:44,879
Second Brother, you stay here and take care of your injury and Eldest Brother.

337
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:56,700
In order for me to take action easily, I should dress up as a man with you.

338
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,080
Why did you buy me women's clothes?

339
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,940
It's suspicious when two men walk together.

340
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:05,500
Shopping with my wife is the best disguise.

341
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:09,620
Can we find Su Tang and Mo Lin for help?

342
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:12,900
I've been asking about them but there's no of their whereabouts.

343
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,530
It's a good thing Mo Lin is smart.

344
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:16,950
He won't let anything happen to Su Tang.

345
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,680
You're awake.

346
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,630
You had a relapse of asthma.

347
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:52,510
You can't show up in the city so you can only stay here.

348
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:54,600
You still saved me in the end.

349
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:58,840
Brother Xu, there can always be a second chance.

350
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,960
You should take care of your injury first.

351
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,750
Then I will bring you to see my older brother.

352
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:07,079
He always said he feels sorry for you.

353
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:11,260
If he knew you have changed your ways, he would be very happy.

354
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:13,220
I'll get you your medicine.

355
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:18,140
Su Tang, if I change,

356
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:20,280
can you forgive me?

357
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,080
Brother Xu, are you okay?

358
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,060
Su Tang,

359
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,900
I've always been true to you.

360
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:45,580
I just made a wrong choice at that time.

361
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:47,740
I didn't get anything.

362
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,620
The Mountain and Sea Gang and Tan State abandoned me.

363
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:56,560
I am half dead right now with nowhere to call home but I understand that

364
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:01,140
right now, you are the only one who is truly doing what is good for me.

365
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:05,390
I will never lie to you again.

366
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:07,380
Can you forgive me?

367
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,360
Brother Xu, are you okay?

368
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:35,300
Master, even a rabbit that's bitten by a snake knows to be in pain.

369
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,830
You can be tricked

370
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:41,360
but I am not willing to see you be tricked by him, again and again.

371
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,920
This person, I'm not taking care of him anymore!

372
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:49,940
Mo Lin! Mo Lin!

373
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,260
Mo Lin!

374
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:56,220
Mo Lin! Mo Lin!

375
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,060
You're more worried about Mo Lin than before.

376
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,360
I…

377
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:15,040
Lu Ping, if you were the you from when you were in the Pneuma Combat Convention,

378
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,130
you would definitely say that your sister is the most important.

379
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:19,410
The emperor means nothing.

380
00:33:19,419 --> 00:33:23,180
Yet, now that's we've encountered such a hardship, you are still willing to help.

381
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,380
Do you really want to be an official?

382
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,160
I haven't decided yet whether or not I want to be an official.

383
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:34,380
I only know that the common people have gone through a lot in order to live the happy life they're living now.

384
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:38,180
This world can't be in chaos anymore.

385
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,680
I know that I'm handsome.

386
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:50,220
See? Someone is already following me.

387
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,620
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

388
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,560
They're from the Mountain and Sea Gang.

389
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:09,020
The people from the Mountain and Sea Gang got here so quick.

390
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,810
I'm afraid the Big Dipper is in great danger.

391
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:13,080
We have to find Minister Xu soon.

392
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,350
Guys, you have been holding my umbrella for such a long time.

393
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:19,140
Do you want to buy it or not?

394
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,860
We don't want to buy the umbrella but some news from you.

395
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:24,760
We're visiting relatives of Minister Xu.

396
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,630
We came to seek refuge from Minister Xu,

397
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:30,540
but we are new here and don't know where to find him.

398
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:33,400
This is hard to say.

399
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:40,770
The city was in unrest a while ago.

400
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:44,579
Minister Xu set a curfew in the city. He patrols the streets and the city everyday.

401
00:34:44,579 --> 00:34:47,780
He must be patrolling right now.

402
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,720
Excuse me! Did you see a man that's about this tall

403
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,199
with a cloth bag on his back and a crossbow on his waist?

404
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,860
- No.
- You really didn't see him? Can you think about it again?

405
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:59,179
- I really didn't.
- You really didn't?

406
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,339
Thanks to Minister Xu.

407
00:35:02,339 --> 00:35:05,660
- There's no war anymore and we can run our businesses again.
- Naturally.

408
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:08,400
- Peace is the best.
- Yes.

409
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,540
I also heard that during the peace talk,

410
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:14,200
Minister Xu punished his own son.

411
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,940
Short-sighted people.

412
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,360
They're from the Mountain and Sea Gang.

413
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,030
He's acting so sneakily.

414
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:35,980
Surely, there must be something wrong with him.

415
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:42,120
[Yuezhou]

416
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:45,419
Minister, news from Jiangning and Jingzhou have also sent news that

417
00:35:45,419 --> 00:35:47,560
they haven't found the whereabouts of Young Master.

418
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:53,060
There's no body to prove he's alive or corpse to prove he's dead.

419
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:56,420
I have been upright my entire life.

420
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:59,160
In the end,

421
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:03,140
I have to endure the pain of losing my son.

422
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,600
Search! Keep searching.

423
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,100
Yes.

424
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,140
Minister Xu, sorry about this.

425
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:32,260
Minister Xu, I'm afraid the Mountain and Sea Gang are watching.

426
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,839
Let's talk inside the carriage.

427
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,340
Minister.

428
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,560
Nothing! I sprained my ankle.

429
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,520
- Move on.
- Move.

430
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,639
It seems that Lu Ping is not here. Let's go somewhere else.

431
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:55,860
You mean that the Mountain and Sea Gang has already breached the Big Dipper?

432
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:59,079
Yes. We were ambushed in the middle of the mountain by them.

433
00:36:59,079 --> 00:37:01,720
We were only able to escape from a small path to Yuezhou.

434
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,439
The Mountain and Sea Gang must know that we would definitely come to find you.

435
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:08,260
In order to avoid them, we had to do this.

436
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:11,600
We are sorry about the offense.

437
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,700
The Big Dipper is probably in danger now.

438
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:19,160
Minister Xu, please send us out of the city and help the Big Dipper out.

439
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,939
If the Mountain and Sea Gang is so capable,

440
00:37:21,939 --> 00:37:26,000
why don't they publicize this to demoralize the martial arts circles?

441
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,060
I wouldn't have known about this if it weren't for you guys.

442
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:31,340
We also don't know about their intentions right now,

443
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:34,080
but as long as you assist us,

444
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:38,080
in saving the Big Dipper and the Shuo State, I would be extremely grateful.

445
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:41,480
Lu Ping, it's not that I don't wish to help.

446
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:44,540
I need you to be honest with me.

447
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:51,300
It's not difficult for you and Miss Qin to come to Yuezhou to ask for help with your skills.

448
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,239
Why must you come to me for help?

449
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:56,680
Do you have other secrets?

450
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:01,800
I wonder if there are other people in Yuezhou,

451
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:05,420
who are important and need to be personally protected by you?

452
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,560
Minister Xu doesn't need to know abou that.

453
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,440
It's also for your own good.

454
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,300
All you need to know is that

455
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:19,800
if the Big Dipper and the martial arts circles are destroyed by Liu Song,

456
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:24,220
the next ones in crisis will be the Tan and Shuo State.

457
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,940
The mistake made by Xu Weifeng

458
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:34,060
can only be remedied by you now.

459
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,480
Okay.

460
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:42,419
Since you helped with the peace talk, I am willing to believe you.

461
00:38:42,419 --> 00:38:45,719
However, we need to keep this low-key.

462
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:51,920
I have some soldiers in the city that I can move and have them follow you to the Big Dipper.

463
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:56,880
I thank Minister Xu on behalf of Big Dipper.

464
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,560
I still need some time to prepare for this.

465
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:04,600
Where should I find you when it is ready?

466
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:08,020
Minister Xu, to be safe,

467
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:10,620
let's meet at a middle ground.

468
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:15,420
Long time, no see! Miss Qin, youhave become extremely cautious as well.

469
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:19,400
Fine! Before the curfew tomorrow night,

470
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,560
let's meet in front of the city gate.

471
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:25,679
Okay. We will be waiting for your good news.

472
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,220
You are cautious.

473
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:38,120
I didn't expect Miss Qin to be better than me now.

474
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:41,920
We escaped together. It wasn't all for nought.

475
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,940
I just don't know if Minister Xu can keep his promise.

476
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:51,360
What are you doing? Are you not afraid to be discovered by the Mountain and Sea Gang?

477
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,380
Let's worry about tomorrow's problems tomorrow.

478
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:57,239
The curfew will be imposed immediately. It's impossible for the Mountain and Sea Gang to search now.

479
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,500
My Dear, do you want to go to the night market

480
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:04,600
and get some delicious food for our brothers?

481
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:08,000
Fine! Then I will follow my husband.

482
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:13,620
There were too many people in the market today. I lost them.

483
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,760
Lost them?

484
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:21,559
Two full-grown adults, how could you lose them? How?

485
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,560
Master, Lu Ping is too cunning.

486
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,280
We don't know where he hides that Zhai b*stard.

487
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:31,820
Yuezhou is heavily guarded right now, it… it would be difficult to follow them.

488
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:33,840
Difficult?

489
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:37,379
- I will find someone else to do it—
- Plan well before you act, you will win.

490
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:43,080
Plan after you act, you will lose.

491
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,180
Master Zhou,

492
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:47,940
it seems like you don't understand this principle.

493
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,500
Xu Weifeng?

494
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,679
you are supposed to be a dead man.

495
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:58,060
How dare you walk in front of me?

496
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:00,619
I heard your conversation just now.

497
00:41:00,619 --> 00:41:03,140
Master Zhou wants to catch Lu Ping and Zhai Rong.

498
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:07,139
You won't succeed without my help.

499
00:41:07,139 --> 00:41:09,470
A bereaved dog

500
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:12,840
dares to boast without shame now.

501
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:16,520
Lu Ping escaping into Yuezhou can only mean to go to my dad for help.

502
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:21,000
Even if he wants to punish me, he is still my father.

503
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,739
I have one and only condition.

504
00:41:22,739 --> 00:41:27,500
After this is done, the Mountain and Sea Gang must keep me and Su Tang safe.

505
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:34,319
I didn't expect you to really fall for the girl?

506
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:52,300
Young Lord Xu, then show me your big move.

507
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,280
We are really running out of time.

508
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:58,099
Excuse me! Boss, did you see a man about this tall

509
00:41:58,099 --> 00:42:01,139
with a cloth bag on his back and a crossbow on his waist?

510
00:42:01,139 --> 00:42:03,600
No. Ask someone else.

511
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,840
Mo Lin?

512
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,760
Mo Lin!

513
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,640
Su Tang.

514
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:19,099
I saw Mo Lin just now but he didn't listen to me.

515
00:42:19,099 --> 00:42:21,280
He wanted to go back to the Big Dipper.

516
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:25,220
You're having an asthma attack again. Let's go back to rest.

517
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:27,880
Then what about Mo Lin?

518
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,200
Since he went back to the Big Dipper,

519
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:36,360
I will explain to him when you get better.

520
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,880
Let's go.

521
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,260
Don't worry, Su Tang.

522
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:46,320
After this,

523
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:50,520
your life will only be sweet.

524
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,540
Xiao Liu.

525
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:49,450
[Ending OST: "The Paper Boat"]
[by Zhiqian Xue — Singers: Zhiqian Xue and Kewei Yu]

526
00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:55,510
♫ Waiting to be buried by the lake in the town, ♫

527
00:43:55,510 --> 00:44:01,640
♫ the White Paper Boat drifting with sorrow. ♫

528
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:07,460
♫ Lights on the other side of the sea ♫

529
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:15,780
♫ punched fingertips in the red water tower. ♫

530
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:25,520
♫ Watch the little boat churning, laughing at the ordinariness. ♫

531
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:29,840
♫ Like a kite being pulled into a low altitude, ♫

532
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:35,260
♫ I smiled to the leaving person. ♫

533
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:39,590
♫ The more spotlight, the more vivid the story. ♫

534
00:44:39,590 --> 00:44:44,570
♫ Laughing like the moon, ♫

535
00:44:44,570 --> 00:44:49,030
♫ regretting the lighthouse broke in the waves, ♫

536
00:44:49,030 --> 00:44:56,550
♫ I call the Milky Way that isolates us all, blue. ♫

537
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:03,740
♫ Like a moat built under the sea, ♫

538
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:08,490
♫ waiting for the words on the paper boat to disappear, ♫

539
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:15,950
♫ there must always be someone who doesn’t remember listening to the other. ♫

540
00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:23,260
♫ Anyone who is correctly guessed will end in disfavor. ♫

541
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:27,360
♫ You are particularly touched but others consider it ordinary. ♫

542
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:32,750
♫ Like the author, roughly put down with a weak stroke, ♫

543
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:37,130
♫ the writing boat on the lake was just like a paper crane in the air. ♫

544
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:42,030
♫ Laughing like the moon, ♫

545
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:46,610
♫ regretting the lighthouse broke in the waves, ♫

546
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:54,510
♫ I call the Milky Way that isolates us all, blue ♫

547
00:45:56,490 --> 00:46:01,620
♫ Can a moat be built on the seabed?  ♫

548
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:06,010
♫ Wipe all the words on the paper boat! ♫

549
00:46:06,010 --> 00:46:13,270
♫ Please let someone not remember and don't tell another! ♫

550
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:20,440
♫ Hide the reluctance between words ♫

551
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:25,000
♫ Unfortunately, I (you) are an average author ♫

552
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:33,170
♫ No matter how you (I) describe the rest, it's unnecessary! ♫

553
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:43,600
♫ Don't describe my unfulfilled promise! ♫

554
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:52,400
♫ Don't interpret my hidden fire-smoke! ♫

555
00:46:52,400 --> 00:47:01,320
♫ Don't let the paper boat in the rough wave chasing me! ♫

556
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:09,080
♫ Don't wait until it's over to know there are you and me! ♫
