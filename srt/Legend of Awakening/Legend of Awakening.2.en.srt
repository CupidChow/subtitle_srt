00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,790
♫ The dark green sea is hazy ♫

3
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:32,790
♫ dissipating in a flash. ♫

4
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,630
♫ Rivers and lakes divide the world. ♫

5
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,040
♫ Ten thousands arrows are firing at once. ♫

6
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,970
♫ Who has time to worry? Who loves the color of blood? ♫

7
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:47,730
♫ At that time, spirits are high. ♫

8
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:51,660
♫ Who calls the world his home? Who dares let his horse freely run? ♫

9
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,390
♫ Silently, tears form in the death of night. ♫

10
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,210
♫ Heroes are cutting all ties, ♫

11
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:02,010
♫ giving up whether it's life or death, ♫

12
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:04,110
♫ never asking what the cost is. ♫

13
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:09,930
♫ Good and evil must be distinguished. ♫

14
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,780
♫ The wind blows off the snow. ♫

15
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:17,650
♫ On the body, etch multiple scars, ♫

16
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:19,760
♫ wandering all over the world, ♫

17
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:25,280
♫ only wish to ask for answers from this world. ♫

18
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,220
♫ A teenager doesn't have to be a hero. ♫

19
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,160
♫ There is no need for flowers in the dream. ♫

20
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,170
♫ Destiny need not be afraid. ♫

21
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:40,820
♫ Because you have him all the way, ♫

22
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:44,790
♫ experienced a handful of conquests, ♫

23
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:48,630
♫ overcame a number of challenges. ♫

24
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,710
♫ From now on, happy and free! ♫

25
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:56,300
♫ The only wish is, with the world, ♫

26
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:00,700
♫ would come along the willing of change. ♫

[Episode 2]

29
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:33,339
- You are not Madam Jin.
- Mountain and Sea Gang's insolent chap, don't you dare run away!

30
00:02:33,339 --> 00:02:35,180
Mountain and Sea Gang?

31
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:46,640
So you're here?

32
00:02:50,979 --> 00:02:52,239
The Sun Streamer Swordplay?

33
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,800
This lady...

34
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,298
- Eldest Senior.
- You are attacking a lady.

35
00:02:59,298 --> 00:03:00,960
I'm afraid that's inappropriate.

36
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:07,079
How did someone from Mountain and Sea Gang find his way here?

37
00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:11,699
Only the invincible Mountain and Sea Gang can tide you over.

38
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,100
Eldest Senior.

39
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,120
They can't defeat Mountain and Sea Gang.

40
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,918
Senior Brother, this is a serious situation.

41
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:44,859
- How can you not save Madam Jin?
- Senior Brother.

42
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,100
You can't catch me.

43
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,119
Your skills are pretty good.

44
00:03:57,859 --> 00:04:00,059
But you are not that smart.

45
00:04:00,059 --> 00:04:03,399
Mountain and Sea Badge will only get you killed.

46
00:04:03,399 --> 00:04:05,680
The man whose Mountain and Sea Badge was taken,

47
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,539
how long do you think he'll survive?

48
00:04:35,979 --> 00:04:37,299
That's impossible!

49
00:04:37,299 --> 00:04:40,679
Throughout the ages, martial arts practitioner can only master five pneumas at most.

50
00:04:40,679 --> 00:04:42,679
There has never been anyone who has mastered six pneumas.

51
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,899
What monster are you?

52
00:04:44,899 --> 00:04:46,630
This monster...

53
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:49,399
It was created by Mountain and Sea Gang.

54
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:57,798
Disturbances in the three realms are like a burning mansion.

55
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:00,480
Only the invincible Mountain and Sea Gang

56
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,679
can tide you over.

57
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:18,439
It's you!

58
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:20,880
You're the one that our master has been searching for three years.

59
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,439
The Awakener with the unity of six pneumas.

60
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,979
Do you know how badly our master wanted to find you?

61
00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:36,519
Since I managed to escape,

62
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:39,099
I won't be caught by you again.

63
00:05:41,859 --> 00:05:43,679
Stop right there!

64
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,239
This is...

65
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,519
The pneumatic power is disappearing soon.

66
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:34,800
I have to get the silver taels quickly.

67
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:47,720
Madam Jin.

68
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,139
Madam Jin.

69
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:51,140
Madam Jin, are you all right?

70
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,739
Old Guo.

71
00:06:52,739 --> 00:06:54,259
You're finally here to save me.

72
00:06:54,259 --> 00:06:56,700
I was so frightened.

73
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,460
Madam Jin, I'm Zhao Xifan.

74
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:05,899
Zhao...

75
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,460
Listen, Young Master Zhao!

76
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:21,020
Here in Chenqiao Town, as long as you're around to protect us,

77
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:24,000
I feel especially safe.

78
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,880
Unlike your Old Guo, he is such a coward.

79
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,718
- From now on—
- Dispose of the bullies and assist the weak!

80
00:07:31,718 --> 00:07:33,840
That is what I should do.

81
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:37,959
Speaking of which, I just recalled that just now, I—
- Eldest Senior, Eldest Senior!

82
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:40,300
Senior Brother, the bandits were taken down by Su Tang.

83
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,359
- What about their valuables?
- The valuables are still here.

84
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:46,880
- He will come again.
- Eldest Senior, Eldest Senior.

85
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,980
- Smart move!
- Brother, are you all right?

86
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:31,279
That man was from Mountain and Sea Gang.

87
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,130
Don't worry! Outsiders are easy to tackle.

88
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,259
It's our people that's troublesome.

89
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:43,060
However, Su Tang, next time, don't be too harsh on them.

90
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,259
It won't be good if he dies.

91
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:49,878
Eldest Senior, Eldest Senior, Eldest Senior.

92
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:51,518
- Eldest Senior.
- Eldest Senior, wake up!

93
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,458
- Eldest Senior.
- Wake up, Eldest Senior! Eldest Senior!

94
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,610
Where is the God of Bandits?

95
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:00,159
- He left!
- He has gone!

96
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,040
What are you laughing at?

97
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,280
Eldest Senior, your face...

98
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,760
Take a look in the mirror!

99
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:31,399
Eldest Senior, did you just get back?

100
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:34,979
Master has cooked chicken as a treat, it will get cold if you don't eat up.

103
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,050
You were on watch duty today.

104
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:43,579
What did you keep watch on?

105
00:09:43,579 --> 00:09:47,179
I did keep watch but after a while, I got hungry.

106
00:09:47,179 --> 00:09:51,038
You said you would be back in two hours, who knew that you were still away after the sun has set?

107
00:09:51,038 --> 00:09:53,210
I also thought you attended the wedding.

108
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:56,129
Do you know that due to your negligence, something terrible almost happened?

109
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:58,540
- Exactly!
- "Something terrible"?

110
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:02,620
What's so terrible? Doesn't every one of you look fine?

111
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:07,819
Lu Ping, if you had given us a heads-up, Eldest Senior wouldn't be injured by the God of Bandits.

112
00:10:07,819 --> 00:10:10,398
Even without any pneumatic power, you should at least have common sense.

113
00:10:10,398 --> 00:10:12,519
- Exactly.
- That's right!
- It's all your fault!

114
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:15,718
- You have no common sense at all.
- Exactly! Seriously!

115
00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:19,939
You were hurt? Are you all right?

116
00:10:19,939 --> 00:10:21,479
That God of Bandits is too mean.

117
00:10:21,479 --> 00:10:24,499
- He even drew on Eldest Senior's face—
- That's enough!

118
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,219
Yes, it's my fault. It's my fault!

119
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:38,779
It looks like I made Eldest Senior embarrass himself.

120
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,018
Fine! I dare you to eat.

121
00:10:45,018 --> 00:10:46,638
You show no remorse at all!

122

- This...
- The drumsticks...

123
00:10:55,299 --> 00:10:57,059
Eldest Senior.

124
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:00,280
Let's be reasonable.

125
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,239
When I told you I would cause trouble if I carried out the mission with you all,

126
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,100
you and Master insisted that I went.

127
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,559
If you didn't insist on competing against that God of Bandits,

128
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:13,600
could you have lost today? What's so bad about being like a turtle?

129
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,039
If we learn to hide like it does, we might even get to live longer.

- Are we eating or not?
- Let's eat!

134

- Let's eat.
- Here, take a seat!

135
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,619
- Come, come, come!
- Give me one! I'm starving.

136

Come on, move!

Isn't this... Isn't this the pretty little thing

who was marrying me instead of Madam Jin?

155
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,079
Madam Jin was afraid that she's not good enough for you,

156
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:39,720
so she sent me instead.

157

This is my family heirloom.

It's a gift for my husband.

Wei Ming! Wei Ming!

162
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:01,179
Where on earth is he?

163
00:13:01,179 --> 00:13:03,759
I can't walk anymore!

164
00:13:05,359 --> 00:13:07,659
Help!

165
00:13:07,659 --> 00:13:09,760
Help!

166
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,439
Hold on!

167
00:13:13,439 --> 00:13:16,640
Let me take a look!

168
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:20,060
- I dare you to touch me.
- Touch you?

169
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:23,979
I'll touch you if I want.

170
00:13:23,979 --> 00:13:26,339
Let me go! Release me!

171
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:29,540
- Madam Jin said she wanted to put on an act with me.
- Get lost! Let go of me!

172
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:33,058
It ended up getting my Chuanyun Fort destroyed by Wind Taker Institute.
- Get lost!

173
00:13:33,058 --> 00:13:36,860
- Put me down!
- The few of us will vent it out on you.

174
00:13:39,479 --> 00:13:41,540
Let me take a look!

175
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,839
Leader!

176
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:51,220
You'd better behave when I play nice.

177
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:54,419
Tie her legs together!

178
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:03,180
You... Who exactly are you?

179
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,139
Miss, are you all right?

180
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,679
I'm the first disciple of Chan State's martial arts academy, Wei Tianqi.

181
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:15,600
Who are you? In broad daylight, how dare you...
[Young Master of Wei Household, Wei Tianqi]

182
00:14:16,239 --> 00:14:19,440
- Who is it?
- Beat him up!

183
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,198
Who is hitting me? Do you know who my father is?

184
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:25,179
Who cares who your father is?

185
00:14:25,179 --> 00:14:26,638
I'm your grandfather!

186
00:14:26,638 --> 00:14:27,939
Beat him up!

187
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,939
- Wei Ming!
- Beat him up!

188
00:14:29,939 --> 00:14:32,660
- Kick him!
- Wei Ming!

189
00:14:34,099 --> 00:14:37,778
- Leader, Leader, Leader!
- Leader, Leader, Lead—

190
00:14:37,778 --> 00:14:39,700
Ziyan.

191
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,879
Miss, are you all right?

192
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:44,699
Where have you been?

193
00:14:44,699 --> 00:14:46,420
Where did all of you go?

194
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:50,498
Although I can take on ten men, I can't fend off scoundrels who sneaked up on me.

195
00:14:50,498 --> 00:14:54,078
- Young Master, didn't you tell us not to follow you?
- You...

196
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,240
Young Master Wei, are you all right?

197
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:05,218
Don't worry, miss! I am fine.

198
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,420
I wonder if you're hurt?

199
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,560
We'll take our leave.

200
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,440
Hold on!

201
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,099
Miss, we just met for the first time today

202
00:15:17,099 --> 00:15:19,020
but we overcame a threat to our lives together.

203
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:21,380
This isn't just any ordinary fate.

204
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,059
Chan State is not far from here.

205
00:15:23,059 --> 00:15:26,798
I wonder if you'll come with me to rest for a few days at my residence?

206
00:15:26,798 --> 00:15:29,200
We have deer antlers, ginseng, and all sorts of medicine.

207
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,359
We'll take great care of you.

208
00:15:31,359 --> 00:15:33,499
Chan State?

209
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:35,460
Wei Tianqi?

210
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,859
You're from Wei Zhong's family?

211
00:15:37,859 --> 00:15:40,119
You know my father?

212
00:15:41,219 --> 00:15:45,778
Since Young Master Wei has invited me with such hospitality, I'll accept it graciously.

213
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,119
I'll arrange for a carriage.

214
00:15:48,119 --> 00:15:50,019
You two, get a carriage ready.

215
00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:52,199
- Miss, you're hurt.
- Prepare some food.

216
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:54,840
Why don't you report to the General back in Kaifeng?

217
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:59,519
Let's not trouble my brother with such trivialities! I can handle it.

218
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,358
Besides, as for that rascal from Mountain and Sea Gang who humiliated me,

219
00:16:03,358 --> 00:16:07,840
I have to catch him and skin him myself, to vent my anger.

220
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,380
Brother.

221
00:16:21,739 --> 00:16:23,978
Eldest Senior cares the most about his dignity.

222
00:16:23,978 --> 00:16:25,919
He treats you kindly as well.

223
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:28,898
What you did to him... it's too pitiful for him.

224
00:16:28,898 --> 00:16:31,239
What is it? Are you worried?

225
00:16:31,239 --> 00:16:33,140
Are you upset?

226
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,539
I knew it! You're at the age to fall in love.

227
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:41,400
Although Zhao Xifan often picks on me, luckily he's good-looking.

228
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,960
He's not a bad person, either.

229
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:47,059
He might not be good enough for you but he can get by.

230
00:16:47,059 --> 00:16:50,479
When I'm gone, you'll have someone to rely on.

231
00:16:50,479 --> 00:16:53,500
No way! I'll follow you wherever you go.

232
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,479
My silly little sister, you're not my real sister.

233
00:16:58,479 --> 00:17:01,459
How can I make you waste away your life?

234
00:17:01,459 --> 00:17:03,999
You'll get married someday.

235
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:07,519
As for me, once I unlock these chains, I'll...

236
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:09,659
- Brother.
- Osmanthus candy?

237
00:17:11,059 --> 00:17:13,140
Don't change the topic!

238
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:19,060
We'll talk about the future later.

239
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,819
We've been busy all day.

240
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:23,679
Get some sleep soon.

241
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,389
What's so bad about being like a turtle?

242
00:17:52,389 --> 00:17:56,579
If we learn to hide like it does, we might even get to live longer.

243
00:17:56,579 --> 00:17:58,600
Didn't he leave earlier?

244
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:02,100
The God of Bandits drew a turtle on my face?

245
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,360
Could he be...

246
00:18:05,059 --> 00:18:08,339
But that fellow can't even walk straight.

247
00:18:08,339 --> 00:18:10,800
How can he possibly be...

248
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,120
[The valiance of Wind Takers]

249
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:44,359
I'm really down on luck today.

250
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:47,080
I'm nearly half dead.

251
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,299
Mountain and Sea Gang...

252
00:19:07,299 --> 00:19:09,539
They still found their way here.

253
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:01,879
Little one, come with me!

254
00:20:01,879 --> 00:20:04,239
I don't want to!

255
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:13,870
No... No! I don't want to!

256
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:38,080
You're injured.

257
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,299
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

258
00:20:41,979 --> 00:20:44,420
It's harder to keep you in the dark now.

259
00:20:50,059 --> 00:20:51,600
Brother.

260
00:20:52,439 --> 00:20:54,919
You should have the osmanthus candy.

261
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:59,610
When I came in,

262
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:02,080
you were trembling all over.

263
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:25,180
You shouldn't have fled with me.

264
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:28,059
I got you into this mess.

265
00:21:28,059 --> 00:21:30,140
You didn't.

266
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:34,599
Everyone thinks I'm protecting you.

267
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:37,070
But I know that...

268
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:39,590
you've always protected me.

269
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,579
Save my little sister.

270
00:21:59,439 --> 00:22:01,980
I've enjoyed the past three years.

271
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,210
A girl in her teens,

272
00:22:06,819 --> 00:22:09,820
doesn't even tremble upon hearing about killing someone.

273
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,320
How is that any good?

274
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,760
You shouldn't be leading such a life.

275
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:22,680
All the more, you shouldn't let a monster like me drag you down.

276
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,839
You're not a monster.

277
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:28,919
You're my God-brother.
 (TN: They aren't biological siblings.)

278
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:37,559
Master Guo sounds harsh but he's kind at heart.

279
00:22:38,299 --> 00:22:40,779
Zhao Xifan isn't a bad person, either.

280
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,530
It's pretty good for you here.

281
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:48,899
- You don't have to spend your life on the run with me.
- No way!

282
00:22:48,899 --> 00:22:52,399
When you carried me on your back out of Mountain and Sea Gang that year,

283
00:22:52,399 --> 00:22:55,859
I'll cling to you for life. Don't dream of leaving me behind!

284
00:22:58,779 --> 00:23:00,300
Silly girl.

285
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,500
It hurts so much...

286
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,500
You're so ungrateful.

287
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:21,959
Are you trying to break my old bones?

288
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:27,799
You've deceived your mentor and betrayed your ancestors.

289
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:31,519
Master, as our mentor, you are eavesdropping on us.

290
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:34,639
Still talking back. Answer me!

291
00:23:34,639 --> 00:23:37,599
Did you offend anyone from Mountain and Sea Gang?

292
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:40,118
Master, you drink every day, you must have had too much to drink.

293
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:41,819
You got it wrong.

294
00:23:41,819 --> 00:23:44,199
I'm very sober.

295
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,500
Are you still trying to fool me?

296
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,799
If I knew you were a troublemaker,

297
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:52,820
I wouldn't have brought you back so easily back then.

298
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,760
Listen up! You're not welcome here anymore.

299
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,140
Move out quickly.

300
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,859
Move all of these out! Get going.

301
00:23:58,859 --> 00:24:01,000
Get lost!

302
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,619
Hurry, hurry, hurry out! You have the cheek to tell me that?

303
00:24:03,619 --> 00:24:05,179
If you didn't ask me for so much money,

304
00:24:05,179 --> 00:24:07,219
I could have bought Wind Taker Institute with what I paid you.

305
00:24:07,219 --> 00:24:09,239
You're still haggling with me?

306
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:11,040
You're getting even with me?

307
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,659
Fine, answer me!

308
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:15,538
Everything you ate and used in the past three years, and your expenses. Are those included?

309
00:24:15,538 --> 00:24:17,699
Also, there are the renovation fees for Wind Taker Institute.

310
00:24:17,699 --> 00:24:20,000
The repair fees of the walls at the entrance... I didn't even pin that on you.

311
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,260
How dare you haggle with me? Are you joking?

312
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,980
Seriously!

313
00:24:25,879 --> 00:24:27,560
Who threw that at me?

314
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,479
It's real gold.

315
00:24:48,879 --> 00:24:50,680
It weighs at least two taels.

316
00:24:54,539 --> 00:24:56,840
When did you get this?

317
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:00,560
During the fight at Chuanyun Fort, I took it on the way out.

318
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,719
Su Tang.

319
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:13,139
Come here!

320
00:25:15,219 --> 00:25:18,458
If only your God-brother were a bit more diligent,

321
00:25:18,458 --> 00:25:20,678
he could have paid off his debts sooner.

322
00:25:20,678 --> 00:25:23,018
Then you wouldn't have to work so hard.

323
00:25:23,018 --> 00:25:26,500
If I take too much with me, won't Eldest Senior hate me even more?

324
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,579
You're overthinking.

325
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:36,198
Listen! Pay off your debts sooner and get out of here sooner.

326
00:25:36,198 --> 00:25:38,679
Stop getting me into trouble.

327
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:44,499
Brother, why is Master always like this?

328
00:25:44,499 --> 00:25:48,460
He's always seizing the chance to drive you out but he never really did.

329
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:52,659
Even if he doesn't drive me away, won't I have to leave as well?

330
00:25:52,659 --> 00:25:56,379
When that man in black barged into Mountain and Sea Gang and rescued us...

331
00:26:37,259 --> 00:26:39,060
He even opened up a crack

332
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:41,819
in my Pneuma Confinement with his powers.

333
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,679
Leave quickly!

334
00:27:10,219 --> 00:27:13,020
- You're the God of... The God of...
- Exactly!

335
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:15,539
Leave now! Go!

336
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,180
Since we fled from Mountain and Sea Gang,

337
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,979
during the past three years,

338
00:27:22,979 --> 00:27:25,300
I've pretended to be a bandit.

339
00:27:32,839 --> 00:27:36,819
While I tackled those thieves for Wind Taker Institute,

340
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:42,779
I also wanted to lure him out by using his namesake.

341
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:44,738
During my investigation, I found out about someone

342
00:27:44,738 --> 00:27:46,659
who was complimented as Inseparable Manifestation and Obscurity.

343
00:27:46,659 --> 00:27:48,419
He knows everything about martial arts.

344
00:27:48,419 --> 00:27:50,479
Three years ago, he had been to the north.

345
00:27:50,479 --> 00:27:52,558
He lost all his powers after a battle with Mountain and Sea Gang

346
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:54,740
and he's still wanted by them.

347
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,259
This man is Wen Gecheng.

348
00:27:56,259 --> 00:27:59,658
Wen Gecheng is very likely to be the bandit.

349
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,480
Are you sure he can unlock your Pneuma Confinement?

350
00:28:06,499 --> 00:28:09,599
Back then, he only opened up a crack

351
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:12,299
and I already managed to experience a bit of the power of six pneumas.

352
00:28:13,739 --> 00:28:16,560
Even if the chances of unlocking it are slim,

353
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:19,259
I have to give it a try.

354
00:28:19,259 --> 00:28:21,260
Once these chains are broken off,

355
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,019
I will be free.

356
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:31,318
Brother, we've missed the opportunity,

357
00:28:31,318 --> 00:28:33,759
where will we go looking for Wen Gecheng?

358
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:36,199
On Wen Gecheng's carriage,

359
00:28:36,199 --> 00:28:38,399
there's the same symbol in the front and at the back,

360
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,120
that's not the emblem of Agile Dragon Troop.

361
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:46,480
I think I've seen it somewhere.

362
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,019
I remember it now.

363
00:28:55,019 --> 00:28:57,420
It was on the fake Ruyu's sword.

364
00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:00,499
That fake Ruyu spoke and acted

365
00:29:00,499 --> 00:29:02,759
like someone from an aristocratic background.

366
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:07,099
Perhaps, through her, we might find Wen Gecheng.

367
00:29:07,099 --> 00:29:09,080
Where is she now?

368
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,600
She nearly took my pants off.

369
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,220
I left her hanging from a tree in a fit of anger.

370
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:22,279
There were many a slip between the cup and the lip.

371
00:29:22,279 --> 00:29:23,860
It's all my fault! I panicked.

372
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,439
I acted carelessly.

373
00:29:26,539 --> 00:29:29,579
Brother, who exactly is that fake Ruyu?

374
00:29:29,579 --> 00:29:31,538
Since she is of an aristocracy,

375
00:29:31,538 --> 00:29:35,920
- why is she in pursuit of Mountain ans Sea Gang on her own?
- Who knows?

376
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:39,819
Even the Queen Mother of the West has to tend to her injuries.

377
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:43,758
- She couldn't have gone far.
- She would have walked faster than you did.

378
00:29:43,758 --> 00:29:48,579
Brother, if you wish to use your pneumatic power again, you'll have to wait for another half a month.

379
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:52,040
Who said I'll need to use the pneumatic power to search for her?

380
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:55,720
I think that the badger game will work.

381
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:59,399
Su Tang, when you can, ask Eldest Senior out tomorrow

382
00:29:59,399 --> 00:30:01,620
to the woods at the back of the hill.

383
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:06,299
Brother, is this even the time to play matchmaker?

384
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:09,519
It's hard to search for someone but not a renown sword.

385
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:11,918
That young lady's sword is no ordinary sword.

386
00:30:11,918 --> 00:30:14,299
I can't figure it out

387
00:30:14,299 --> 00:30:17,219
but Eldest Senior is very knowledgeable, he might recognize it.

388
00:30:17,219 --> 00:30:20,358
Whether we can get him to tell us, it's entirely up to you.

389
00:30:20,358 --> 00:30:22,719
- No way.
- Hey, Sister.

390
00:30:22,719 --> 00:30:27,778
If it works, I'll buy all the osmanthus candies in the entire Chenqiao Town for you.

391
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,159
If so, I...

392
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,840
I'll think about it.

393
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:51,819
Eldest Senior.

394
00:30:51,819 --> 00:30:53,439
Sparring?

395
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,800
[Wei Residence]

396
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,179
This way, please.

397
00:30:58,959 --> 00:31:01,419
[Prosper Forever] 
My son.

398
00:31:01,419 --> 00:31:03,498
I've missed you.

399
00:31:03,498 --> 00:31:05,639
Where are you hurt? Show me!

400
00:31:05,639 --> 00:31:08,640
Father, that's enough! Everyone is watching, so don't make a fuss.

401
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,258
Did someone bully you? Don't worry!

402
00:31:11,258 --> 00:31:13,900
I'll send Wei Ming and the others to wipe them out.

403
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:17,619
Father, I'm the first disciple of Chan State's martial arts academy! You don't have to avenge me.

404
00:31:17,619 --> 00:31:22,139
Besides, Miss Qin is still watching us.

405
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:27,438
Master Wei, it has been a while.

406
00:31:43,019 --> 00:31:46,478
Eldest Senior, your gestures seem like this is your first time training with a blade.

407
00:31:46,478 --> 00:31:48,899
Why haven't I seen you use one?

408
00:31:50,459 --> 00:31:52,779
Blades don't suit me well.

409
00:31:52,779 --> 00:31:55,019
Why do you suddenly want to practice swordplay?

410
00:31:55,639 --> 00:31:59,980
I saw the fake Ruyu's swordplay, so I practiced it from memory.

411
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:05,258
That woman was an impostor and she was highly skilled.

412
00:32:05,258 --> 00:32:07,199
Her whereabouts are unknown.

413
00:32:07,199 --> 00:32:10,920
Senior Brother, aren't you curious about her identity?

414
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,638
Qin family's Sun Streamer Swordplay.

415
00:32:12,638 --> 00:32:15,118
Although that young lady isn't at the highest level,

416
00:32:15,118 --> 00:32:18,919
judging by her skills, she would have to be Miss Qin to get to that standard.

417
00:32:18,919 --> 00:32:20,659
I can't be wrong about it.

418
00:32:20,659 --> 00:32:22,800
Miss Qin?

419
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,260
We're in trouble.

420
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,638
Chan State is remotely located.

421
00:32:30,638 --> 00:32:32,999
There aren't many martial arts practitioners.

422
00:32:32,999 --> 00:32:34,619
Please forgive us, Miss Qin.

423
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:38,118
Ling Ziyan, what's the punishment for withholding military information?

424
00:32:38,118 --> 00:32:40,898
The general has given orders that anyone who withholds military information

425
00:32:40,898 --> 00:32:43,520
is to be beheaded in public.

426
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,158
Miss Qin, please spare me!

427
00:32:45,158 --> 00:32:47,799
I still have a young son to raise.

428
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,840
I'm willing to make it up to you at whatever the price.

429
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:56,318
Master Wei, you should thank Mountain and Sea Gang.

430
00:32:56,318 --> 00:33:00,058
If it weren't that they have planted a mole in Chan State, I wouldn't ask for your assistance.

431
00:33:00,059 --> 00:33:02,559
By now, you should have been executed.

432
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:04,740
Mountain and Sea Gang?

433
00:33:06,459 --> 00:33:08,139
This man was in a mask.

434
00:33:08,139 --> 00:33:10,240
He is extremely skilled in martial arts.

435
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,058
I suspect that the purpose of the man from Mountain and Sea Gang

436
00:33:13,058 --> 00:33:16,940
who infiltrated Phoenix Ridge Gang, is to meet up with him here.

437
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,740
Before I find him, I won't leave Chan State.

438
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:50,300
[Three years ago]

439
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,879
Brother, stop trying!

440
00:33:56,879 --> 00:34:00,539
Su Tang, I managed to sneak out some pneumatic power again.

441
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:09,459
Not really! It's still not enough.

442
00:34:09,459 --> 00:34:12,220
Since a crack was made in my Pneuma Confinement,

443
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:14,258
the more I suffocate and suffer,

444
00:34:14,258 --> 00:34:16,599
the more pneumatic power I can squeeze out.

445
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,139
As long as I practice every day, I'll get enough power.

446
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:24,780
You'll die from the pain first.

447
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:27,160
Fleeing for my life every day like an invalid?

448
00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:29,999
How is that any different from dying?

449
00:34:41,259 --> 00:34:44,759
No way! If I don't break off my Pneuma Confinement,

450
00:34:44,759 --> 00:34:47,160
I can never defeat Mountain and Sea Gang.

451
00:34:55,199 --> 00:35:00,018
The pneumatic power that he manage to squeeze out each time last only a duration of a burned joss stick.

452
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,100
- Brother.
- Lu Ping.

453
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,220
Lu Ping.

454
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:39,020
Brother, Brother!

455
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,890
Brother, wake up!

456
00:35:52,279 --> 00:35:55,399
Brother, you have woken up! Sit up.

457
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,600
Sit up!

458
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,240
Lu Ping!

459
00:36:05,469 --> 00:36:07,068
Brother, are you all right?

460
00:36:07,068 --> 00:36:09,020
What were you doing?

461
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:13,139
Eldest Senior, why were you so close to me?

462
00:36:13,139 --> 00:36:16,910
You kept diving in while you were chained, do you want to die?

463
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:21,459
- I came to take a bath, what rule did I violate this time?
- Take a bath?

464
00:36:21,459 --> 00:36:25,360
You're taking a bath in chain? Is it fun to joke around with your life?

465
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:30,860
Eldest Senior, since you care so much about me, fine!

466
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:34,729
You saved my life after all, so you get to slap me.

467
00:36:34,729 --> 00:36:37,600
Lu Ping, are you done fooling around?

468
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,339
No one should take life for granted.

469
00:36:39,339 --> 00:36:43,320
As long as I'm in Wind Taker Institute, I won't allow that to happen.

470
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,690
Brother.

471
00:36:50,469 --> 00:36:53,060
Brother, are you all right?

472
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:54,830
What's the matter with him?

473
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,980
Xifan.

474
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:37,130
- What's wrong with you?
- Master.

475
00:37:39,539 --> 00:37:42,179
What have you done again,

476
00:37:42,179 --> 00:37:45,689
that nearly killed all the fishes in my pond at the back of the hill?

477
00:37:49,129 --> 00:37:50,889
Lu Ping, he...

478
00:37:52,219 --> 00:37:54,379
When you saved him back then,

479
00:37:54,379 --> 00:37:56,739
did you know of his identity?

480
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:04,230
What identity can he have?

481
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,879
He is just a starving beggar who was dying of hunger, so I brought him back.

482
00:38:08,879 --> 00:38:11,400
I felt bad for him.

483
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:15,370
Who knew? Wind Taker Institute's whole fortune is nearly used up.

484
00:38:16,019 --> 00:38:18,819
He's always such a scum.

485
00:38:18,819 --> 00:38:21,059
Don't hold it against him!

486
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:28,520
I didn't blame him! I blame myself.

Master.

489
00:38:40,459 --> 00:38:42,319
Master!

490
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:45,440
You're too nervous.

491
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,118
Have a drink! Relax.

492
00:38:48,118 --> 00:38:52,399
Master, it's against the rules to drink in the day and you should also drink less.

493
00:38:52,399 --> 00:38:55,599
The money you spend on alcohol is enough to repair our walls three times.

494
00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:00,160
Xifan, although we don't look into people's true identities here,

495
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:04,930
I can very well guess that you've concealed your true identity.

496
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:09,838
You even practiced the Pneuma of Sound midway when it even wasn't your original skill.

497
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:16,779
You've been in Wind Taker Institute for so long and you still can't relax?

498
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:22,160
Don't bear the weight of everyone's life on your shoulders.

499
00:39:25,569 --> 00:39:27,020
Master.

500
00:39:28,069 --> 00:39:30,599
Back then, if I didn't take a risk recklessly,

501
00:39:31,959 --> 00:39:34,159
I wouldn't have gotten my friend killed.

502
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:40,040
Since I owe him his life, I should repay the debt.

503
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,940
Then you should be a good disciple.

504
00:39:45,609 --> 00:39:48,179
Xifan, bear this in mind!

505
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:56,839
Wearing the badge of the eldest disciple means

506
00:39:56,839 --> 00:40:00,320
that the entire Wind Taker Institute, including me, your master,

507
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,220
look to you for our future.

508
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,060
Hold it!

509
00:40:10,219 --> 00:40:12,290
Let's have a serious talk!

510
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:14,899
It's not very safe out there recently and there are searches going on.

511
00:40:14,899 --> 00:40:18,299
I suspect that some murderous thief might have come here.

512
00:40:18,299 --> 00:40:20,519
Therefore, I need to head to Kaifeng.

513
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:22,760
While I am away, Wind Taker Institute has to be closed to the public

514
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,150
and all disciples are banned from leaving the premises.

515
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:28,039
You... Keep a close eye on those rascals, especially Lu Ping.

516
00:40:28,039 --> 00:40:30,309
Don't let him get into any trouble!

517
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:37,320
Master, you're going to visit your old friend again?

518
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,738
You rascal! How can you joke about this?

519
00:40:39,738 --> 00:40:42,399
Master, forgive me for being honest with you.

520
00:40:42,399 --> 00:40:46,719
Your old friend's temper is really...

521
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:48,870
Special.

522
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:52,460
You always get bruised all over whenever you're there.

523
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:55,540
Why do you still visit every year?

524
00:40:58,219 --> 00:41:02,419
Kid, you won't understand.

525
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:09,029
I'm also atoning for my sins.

[Wei Residence]

527
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:25,919
Miss, we've been searching for four to five days.

528
00:41:25,919 --> 00:41:30,928
The entire Chan State and dozens of towns around it were all searched thoroughly.

529
00:41:30,928 --> 00:41:34,249
There is no one who meets your description.

530
00:41:34,249 --> 00:41:37,018
Forget it! Tell the guards of Wei family to get back.

531
00:41:37,018 --> 00:41:41,299
If we keep searching so indiscreetly, I'm afraid I'll alert the enemy.

532
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:44,938
What should we do? Should we keep searching?

533
00:41:44,938 --> 00:41:47,799
Keep going! Why not?

534
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:53,820
But we're not going to look for a needle in the haystack.

535
00:41:54,699 --> 00:41:57,459
What's your opinion, Young Master Wei?

536
00:41:57,459 --> 00:42:01,699
Sangsang, don't be so distant! You can call me Tianqi.

537
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,019
Tianqi, what's your opinion?

538
00:42:10,379 --> 00:42:13,799
Mr. Changli once said, "Every skill and profession has its specialties."

539
00:42:13,799 --> 00:42:19,259
Since we're tracking someone down, we'll need specific experts in that field.

540
00:42:19,259 --> 00:42:22,239
How should we find such a specific expert?

541
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:26,600
I've already put up posters in the city.

542
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:30,830
There are wanted posters of my "Wanted Intellectuals" in the entire Chan State.

From the east to the west,

544
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:36,809
there's no fear that the gifted won't notice it.

545
00:42:36,809 --> 00:42:41,839
Sangsang, just stay in comfortably and await the arrival of the experts.

546
00:42:46,469 --> 00:42:51,500
Young Master Wei is really.. creative.

547
00:42:55,839 --> 00:43:00,660
Sangsang, Just you wait and see! I'll definitely seek out that person.

548
00:43:05,419 --> 00:43:08,330
Miss, Young Master Wei said he has posted wanted posters

549
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:10,920
from the east to the west of the city.

550
00:43:10,928 --> 00:43:14,600
Perhaps, offering a reward might really work?

551
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:18,360
Wei Tianqi is fooling around, are you going to follow suit?

552
00:43:18,879 --> 00:43:21,000
I'm sorry.

553
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,000
Who is it?

00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:41,480
Please spare me, heroine! I am Mo Lin.
