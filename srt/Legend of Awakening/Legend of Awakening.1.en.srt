There were ongoing disputes between countries and the world was in chaos.

11

Zhai Wei of Dan Kingdom raised a mutiny

12

and named his kingdom Shuo.

Going face to face against Dan Kingdom that retreated to the north.

14
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:36,439
In the midst of the chaos, the trend of practicing martial arts and pneumatic forces rose.

15
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:38,998
Warriors practiced external martial arts

and cultivated internally Vision, Sound, Energy,

21
00:02:53,419 --> 00:02:57,818
It's like reeling silk from cocoons with no silk thread left unreeled.

22
00:02:59,139 --> 00:03:01,379
The Pneuma of Sound makes the practitioner great in distinguishing voices.

23
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,258
Those who master it can hear their surroundings clearly.

24
00:03:03,259 --> 00:03:07,938
Even from a thousand miles away, they can distinguish where the sound came from.

25
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,920
The Pneuma of Energy maximizes the use of energy.

26
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,979
Those who master it can move around as light as the air.

27

They can move faster than an arrow.

28
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,719

Those who master it have a sense of smell and taste a thousand times stronger.

31
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,619
The Pneuma of Strength increases brute force.

32
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:34,378
Those who master it are strong enough to lift up a mountain, shift lands, and rivers.

33
00:03:34,378 --> 00:03:36,619
They will be unstoppable.

34
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,739
The Pneuma of Essence lies in the mind.

35
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:43,079
Those who master it can control minds,

36
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:45,779
it's the most mysterious Pneuma among the six pneumas.

37
00:03:45,779 --> 00:03:49,340
Those whose minds are controlled lose their senses.

38
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,339
Even by training for a lifetime,

39
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,819
it's hard for martial arts practitioners to master all six pneumas.

40
00:03:55,819 --> 00:04:00,179
Legend has it, there are those who are born with the knowledge of using all six pneumas,

41
00:04:00,179 --> 00:04:02,059
but they are hard to come by.

42
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:06,180
They are called the Awakeners.

00:39:27,429 --> 00:39:29,559
You're here to arrest him.

475
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:31,868
The God of Bandits always gets ahead of you.

476
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:35,098
He intercepts those thieves and robs them of the riches.

477
00:39:35,098 --> 00:39:39,279
Will you lose to him again this time and let him get ahead of you?

478
00:39:39,279 --> 00:39:42,059
The God of Bandits shows up every half a month.

479
00:39:42,059 --> 00:39:46,020
Master, I'll do it.

480
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:51,528
Su Tang, why do you look so pale hearing that I'm going after the God of Bandits?

481
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:56,879
Anyway, I can't help you to trick him.

482
00:39:56,879 --> 00:40:00,258
I-I-I won't rescue Madam Jin! My stomach hurts so I'm heading back.

483
00:40:00,258 --> 00:40:02,638
Shitou and the guys already sneaked into the kitchen to drug the food.

484
00:40:02,638 --> 00:40:06,039
You'll rescue Jin Ruyu today and leave the God of Bandits to me.

485
00:40:06,039 --> 00:40:09,079
Eldest Senior, you're so ungrateful.

486
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:13,009
When the bandits went into a frenzy last time, he saved you.

487
00:40:13,659 --> 00:40:15,868
He keeps robbing others of riches.

488
00:40:15,869 --> 00:40:17,939
I have to arrest him since he has violated the law.

489
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:22,418
I think it's because you keep losing to the God of Bandits that you feel embarrassed?

490
00:40:22,418 --> 00:40:26,589
I'm not! Master gave me this badge.

491
00:40:26,589 --> 00:40:29,439
I have to be the role model of Wind Taker Institute.

492
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:45,539
Did I piss Zhao Xifan off so badly that's he's become dumb?

493
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:49,579
He can't even handle some bandits.

494
00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:03,460
My thoughtful wife gave me an heirloom.

495
00:41:04,519 --> 00:41:08,099
- Leader, what treasure is it? Show it to us.
- Yeah.

496
00:41:11,539 --> 00:41:13,099
Leader, it's quite nice.

497
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:15,219
- Let's drink.
- Here...

498
00:41:16,909 --> 00:41:18,980
Tonight I'll...

499
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:41,008
Eldest Senior, something fishy is going on.

500
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,339
That bride isn't Madam Jin.

501
00:41:57,419 --> 00:42:01,438
- You are not Madam Jin.
- Mountain and Sea Gang's insolent chap, don't you dare run away!

502
00:42:01,438 --> 00:42:03,589
Mountain and Sea Gang?

503
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:20,540
[Ending OST: "The Paper Boat"]
[by Zhiqian Xue — Singers: Zhiqian Xue and Kewei Yu]

504
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:26,640
♫ Waiting to be buried by the lake in the town, ♫

505
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:32,710
♫ the White Paper Boat drifting with sorrow. ♫

506
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:38,530
♫ Lights on the other side of the sea ♫

507
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:47,010
♫ punched fingertips in the red water tower. ♫

508
00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:56,550
♫ Watch the little boat churning, laughing at the ordinariness. ♫

509
00:42:56,550 --> 00:43:00,960
♫ Like a kite being pulled into a low altitude, ♫

510
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:06,360
♫ I smiled to the leaving person. ♫

511
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:10,670
♫ The more spotlight, the more vivid the story. ♫

512
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:15,630
♫ Laughing like the moon, ♫

513
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:20,060
♫ regretting the lighthouse broke in the waves, ♫

514
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:27,780
♫ I call the Milky Way that isolates us all, blue. ♫

515
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:34,860
♫ Like a moat built under the sea, ♫

516
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:39,670
♫ waiting for the words on the paper boat to disappear, ♫

517
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:47,270
♫ there must always be someone who doesn’t remember listening to the other. ♫

518
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:54,240
♫ Anyone who is correctly guessed will end in disfavor. ♫

519
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:58,500
♫ You are particularly touched but others consider it ordinary. ♫

520
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:03,760
♫ Like the author, roughly put down with a weak stroke, ♫

521
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:08,110
♫ the writing boat on the lake was just like a paper crane in the air. ♫

522
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:13,010
♫ Laughing like the moon, ♫

523
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:17,780
♫ regretting the lighthouse broke in the waves, ♫

524
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:25,970
♫ I call the Milky Way that isolates us all, blue. ♫

525
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:32,660
♫ Can a moat be built on the seabed? ♫

526
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:37,090
♫ Wipe all the words on the paper boat! ♫

527
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:44,330
♫ Please let someone not remember and don't tell another! ♫

528
00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:51,530
♫ Hide the reluctance between words ♫

529
00:44:51,530 --> 00:44:56,130
♫ Unfortunately, I (you) are an average author ♫

530
00:44:56,130 --> 00:45:04,660
♫ No matter how you (I) describe the rest, it's unnecessary! ♫

531
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:14,680
♫ Don't describe my unfulfilled promise! ♫

532
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:23,360
♫ Don't interpret my hidden fire-smoke! ♫

533
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:32,450
♫ Don't let the paper boat in the rough wave chasing me! ♫

534
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:41,000
♫ Don't wait until it's over to know there are you and me! ♫
