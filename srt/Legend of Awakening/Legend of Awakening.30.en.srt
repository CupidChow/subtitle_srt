00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,860
♫ The dark green sea is hazy ♫

3
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:32,810
♫ dissipating in a flash. ♫

4
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:36,660
♫ Rivers and lakes divide the world. ♫

5
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,990
♫ Ten thousands arrows are firing at once. ♫

6
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:43,990
♫ Who has time to worry? Who loves the color of blood? ♫

7
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:47,800
♫ At that time, spirits are high. ♫

8
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,580
♫ Who calls the world his home? Who dares let his horse freely run? ♫

9
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:54,390
♫ Silently, tears form in the death of night. ♫

10
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,180
♫ Heroes are cutting all ties, ♫

11
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:01,980
♫ giving up whether it's life or death, ♫

12
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,260
♫ never asking what the cost is. ♫

13
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,780
♫ Good and evil must be distinguished. ♫

14
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,700
♫ The wind blows off the snow. ♫

15
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,600
♫ On the body, etch multiple scars, ♫

16
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,710
♫ wandering all over the world, ♫

17
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:25,240
♫ only wish to ask for answers from this world. ♫

18
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:29,200
♫ A teenager doesn't have to be a hero. ♫

19
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,040
♫ There is no need for flowers in the dream. ♫

20
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,140
♫ Destiny need not be afraid. ♫

21
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:40,820

[Episode 30]

29
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,640
Xiao Liu.

30
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,520
I heard that you made me a cenotaph.

31
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,000
In all of the Big Dipper,

32
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,080
I also think the one who remembers me,

33
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,480
is only you.

34
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,300
Don't worry! It hasn't been poisoned.

35
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:47,060
This crab porridge is from the store in Kaifeng.

36
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,979
Back then, you used to say that people would miss the food of their hometown the most

37
00:03:50,979 --> 00:03:54,000
when they were far away.

38
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,060
I should have guessed long ago

39
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,040
that you were from the Hedong Liu Family.

40
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:11,460
You shouldn't have hidden it from Senior Leng, then it wouldn't have turned out this way.

41
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:16,420
Tell me! What did you do to Yan Qiuci?

42
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,840
Finish the porridge!

43
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,020
Then I'll take you to see them.

44
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:24,340
What game are you playing?

45
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,120
Chu Min.

46
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,840
Nineteen years!

47
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,160
You don't know what I've been through these nineteen years.

48
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:42,320
My country was destroyed and I led a miserable life.

49
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,840
I am more like a ghost than a man.

50
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,800
If I didn't keep thinking I'll come back one day,

51
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,960
I wouldn't have made it to today.

52
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,519
Then tell me!

53
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,799
What happened nineteen years ago that turned you out to be like this?

54
00:05:04,799 --> 00:05:07,560
You respected you eldest brother so much.

55
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,840
I don't believe you would've done that.

56
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,820
I don't want to speak about the past.

57
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:18,980
I came back this time because I want to get something of mine back.

58
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:23,820
The Big Dipper is my sect, not my enemy.

59
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,420
What are you going to do?

60
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:30,570
I want my sword, Thousand Pine Ruler.

61
00:05:30,579 --> 00:05:33,239
I left it in the Big Dipper that year.

62
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,500
You should've taken care of it after I died.

63
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,360
You did all this,

64
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,500
just for the Thousand Pine Ruler?

65
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,760
It has always been my sword.

66
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,960
Brother took it back then.

67
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,660
Now, it is time to get it back,

68
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,480
isn't it?

69
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,220
Fine!

70
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:11,640
However, I have a condition.

71
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,520
Can you be at ease now?

72
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,019
Only if you promise not to hurt them,

73
00:06:29,019 --> 00:06:32,180
I will tell where Thousand Pine Ruler is.

74
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,880
Why bother trading with her, Master?

75
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,340
If they're not willing to tell us where the sword is,

76
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:42,960
we will kill them one by one until someone's willing to talk.

77
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,839
You should know how upright the disciples are here.

78
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:51,940
If you dare to let any of your dogs hurt a single one,

79
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:56,900
we won't tell you anything even if we all die.

80
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,400
I promise you.

81
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,279
As long as the Big Dipper doesn't get in my way, I won't hurt a single one of you.

82
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,600
Where is Thousand Pine Ruler?

83
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:13,560
After the event that year, Guo Wushu rebuilt the Seven Martyr Court.

84
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:19,120
Everyone thought you were dead.

85
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,760
So we stored the Thousand Pine Ruler

86
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:25,400
in a secret room inside the Seven Martyr Court.

87
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,639
Guo Wushu rebuilt it himself.

88
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,959
If anyone enters, the machine will start

89
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,140
and the Thousand Pine Ruler will be destroyed.

90
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:43,519
If you want it, give me Guo Wushu and Yan Qiuci.

91
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,959
I will persuade them myself.

92
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:50,360
Guo Wushu is okay, why do you want Yan Qiuci?

93
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,639
Guo Wushu is a freak.

94
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,600
He won't listen to anyone.

95
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,079
You are the master of the Mountain and Sea Gang.

96
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,639
You not only killed his brother, Guo Youdao, but also led your men to the Big Dipper.

97
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:09,660
He won't give it to you even if it means his life.

98
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:14,940
But he respects his brother,

99
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:20,160
so he respects his past fellow disciples.

100
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,559
Yan Qiuci is sensible.

101
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,960
He won't disobey you.

102
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,880
With his help, maybe we can persuade Guo Wushu.

103
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,909
How sly you are!

104
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:36,770
Don't trust her, Master!

105
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:40,590
Escort Senior Yan and Master Guo out.

106
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:49,260
Senior Yan,

107
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:53,880
why did Liu Song imprison us here?

108
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,960
There's definitely something bad going on.

109
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,980
Father, Xi Sui Powder is powerful.

110
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:03,240
It takes time to discharge it.

111
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,120
Why don't you entrust it to me, I will find a way to save us.

112
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,200
You've already restored your Pneuma of Strength?

113
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,619
I was ingrained as part of the Mountain and Sea Gang.

114
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:17,000
The powder is less powerful on me.

115
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:33,560
Master invites Master Yan and Master Guo to the Seven Martyr Court.

116
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,740
Seven Martyr Court?

117
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,660
I have nothing to do with anyone in the Mountain and Sea Gang.

118
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,980
Why should we go?

119
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:47,940
Master Guo, since Liu Song has invited us,

120
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:51,620
why don't we see what he's going to do?

121
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:56,600
Indeed, Master Yan is wise.

122
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,660
Father!

123
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:03,520
It is no use sitting. Help me up!

124
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,699
Liu Song may do harm to His Majesty.

125
00:10:06,699 --> 00:10:08,879
You must get down the mountain to save His Majesty.

126
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:11,760
Otherwise, we will fail.

127
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,779
Master Yan, please.

128
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,999
Master, they are both here.

129
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,419
- Leave us.
- Yes.

130
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,159
I hear that Master Guo is good at machinery.

131
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:41,319
You made machines for the Seven Martyr Court; I am very interested in it.

132
00:10:41,319 --> 00:10:46,720
I come to ask for Seven Martyr Court's blueprints from you.

133
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,400
The blueprint is very important.

134
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:53,720
I won't give it to an evil doer like you.

135
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,499
Guo Wushu, we must go with the flow.

136
00:10:57,499 --> 00:11:01,339
If he wants it, just give it to him.

137
00:11:01,339 --> 00:11:05,939
He was once a lover of yours but has nothing to do with me.

138
00:11:05,939 --> 00:11:09,559
I promised my brother to protect the Seven Martyr Court.

139
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:12,740
I won't let it be broken by others.

140
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:16,320
When I ask you to give it to him, you give it to him. Don't forget!

141
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,319
They have the lives of all the people in the Big Dipper in their hands.

142
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,820
In critical moments, sacrifice the small things to protect the greater ones.

143
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:30,880
Yan Qiuci, can't you help teach him?

144
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:36,080
There is no such thing as a blueprint.

145
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:42,420
In case someone wanted to come and steal the weapons one day,

146
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:46,240
I destroyed it long ago.

147
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,900
He made the traps.

148
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,220
He knows how to draw the blueprint.

149
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,700
Just ask him to draw another one.

150
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:00,100
What are you two doing?

151
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,280
Why are you helping an outsider?

152
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,060
Master Guo,

153
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,440
think of your brother.

154
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,439
We have so many disciples in the Big Dipper.

155
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,220
If Guo Youdao were here, what would he do?

156
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,599
The traps in Seven Martyr Court are complicated.

157
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,100
It will take a long time to draw the blueprint.

158
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:34,360
Please, Master Liu, allow him more time.

159
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:40,840
Since you two have asked, what reason do I have to refuse you?

160
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,340
As long as Chu Min is here, I can wait until tomorrow.

161
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,400
The Mountain and Sea Gang have guarded us for an entire day.

162
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,920
They must be tired.

163
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,700
We have to find a way to get out.

164
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,520
Young Lord Xifan,

165
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,560
this isn't appropriate.

166
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,580
Why?

167
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:28,730
We don't know what Senior Chu has agreed to with the Mountain and Sea Gang.

168
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:34,390
Also, right now, Senior Yan and Master Guo are both in their hands.

169
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:37,370
If we run away and are detected,

170
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:39,820
it might put them in danger.

171
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:43,819
Moreover, it would harm all of the Big Dipper

172
00:13:43,819 --> 00:13:47,980
and these people from the pugilist world.

173
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:53,000
You've said so much and you still don't have any good ideas.

174
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:30,440
- Pavilion Master. Xifan.
- Why are you here?

175
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:34,599
The hole Lu Ping made when he connected his star to his destiny has never been fixed.

176
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,200
You! Take off your clothes.

177
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,960
Senior Huo and Junior Tang are guarding outside right now.

178
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,679
Hurry and leave during the shift change of the guards.

179
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,420
We will replace you.

180
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:47,219
- Isn't this too dangerous?
- Young Lord Xifan.

181
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,460
- Go now!
- Pavilion Master.

182
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:52,199
With these two disciples here, they won't notice you'll have been gone.

183
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,219
Go on quickly! We're all relying on you.

184
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,640
Let's changed.

185
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,419
It hurts! What poison did you give me?

186
00:15:33,419 --> 00:15:35,480
You're trying to kill me.

187
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,920
Liu Song said he wouldn't kill the disciples.

188
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,319
How can you, the Mountain and Sea Gang, be like this?

189
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,679
Come! Drag him out and beat him!

190
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,100
Let him see just how strong we are.

191
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,640
Wait, wait, wait! It doesn't hurt.

192
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,080
It doesn't hurt anymore. Help me, Pavilion Master!

193
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,380
It doesn't hurt. Let me go!

194
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,340
They're here!

195
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,380
You're finally here.

196
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,560
I tell you! It is all about fate.

197
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,640
Lu Ping made a hole and our stingy master never fixed it. It's saving us now.

198
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:14,600
- You've been here watching this whole time. Have you seen Lu Ping being captured?
- No.

199
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,840
That rascal can't be caught that easily.

200
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,479
Who knows, maybe he's waiting for us now at the bottom of the mountain.

201
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,160
Zimu and Jin Qi, they are not familiar.

202
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,260
Nothing will happen to them, will it?

203
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:26,700
Right now, we can only make this gamble.

204
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,580
Lu Ping is with the Agile Dragon Army.

205
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:31,180
When we find him, we'll find our help.

206
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,100
Let's just go.

207
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,920
Let's go.

208
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,420
Young Master Xifan.

209
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:40,239
- What's wrong?
- I'm not going.

210
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,440
What are you doing? After they change the guards, we won't be able to leave.

211
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,320
Lin Tianyi was confused momentarily from the Pneuma of Essence's influence. It won't last long.

212
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,700
I have always been with you.

213
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,980
If I help cover for you, she won't detect Zimu.

214
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,459
Ziyan, your martial arts isn't as strong as your seniors.

215
00:16:57,459 --> 00:16:59,580
It's dangerous for you to stay.

216
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:02,180
I know that you care about me.

217
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,100
So I should consider your situation, too.

218
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,719
I believe that if I stay, I can buy you some more time.

219
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,390
Moreover,

220
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,639
I believe you will definitely come back to rescue me.

221
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,690
I promise you.

222
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:20,660
I will come back for you.

223
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,560
Why did you come back?

224
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,920
I…

225
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,599
Little girl, I can't run away even if I wanted to.

226
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:44,859
Why did you come back? Aren't you afraid of death?

227
00:18:44,859 --> 00:18:46,860
You risked your life to cover for us.

228
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,860
How can I just hide?

229
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:52,439
This is the medicine I got just now.

230
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,119
Let's recover your energy and wait together for Young Master Xifan and Lu Ping to come back.

231
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,480
Senior Huo Ying.

232
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,440
Have you found Lu Ping and Qin Qi?

233
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,520
The Mountain and Sea Gang attacked the camp. There is nothing there.

234
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,120
Someone's coming!

235
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,300
Who are you? Why are you searching for Agile Dragon Army?

236
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,459
- General Wen.
- Young Lord Xifan.

237
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,620
That day, Lu Ping and the general took His Majesty to the institute.

238
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,760
The Mountain and Sea Gang attacked the camp.

239
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,360
It wasn't easy but I gathered everyone who was still alive.

240
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,460
However, I still have no news of Lu Ping or His Majesty.

241
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,360
Right now, I dare not rashly ask for help from the court.

242
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,560
I can only linger here.

243
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,390
We've been keeping watch on the mountain.

244
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:41,510
They haven't captured Lu Ping yet.

245
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:45,339
Where can they be? Can they fly?

246
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,480
They must have taken His Majesty and run.

247
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,340
Zhou Youlong didn't appear at the Big Dipper.

248
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:56,120
He may be chasing them.

249
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,020
If it's in the wild,

250
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:01,400
the Mountain and Sea Gang would search as they like.

251
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,040
If it's taken them this long,

252
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:09,620
Lu Ping must've hidden them in a place where the gang has to be cautious.

253
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,099
Yuezhou! They are in Yuezhou.

254
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:21,690
[Yuezhou]

255
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:32,660
Young Lord Xifan, this is Tan State, I can't lead my soldiers in.

256
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:35,600
You can only rely on yourselves inside.

257
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:40,440
There is a curfew in Yuezhou at night. If you miss the time and can't get out,

258
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,880
we can't help you.

259
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,900
Don't worry, General Wen.

260
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:48,560
I will get Lu Ping and His Majesty out safely.

261
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,260
With so many people and spies of the Mountain and Sea Gang,

262
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,420
how can we find them?

263
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:58,160
Huo Ying, I want to spread some news out without alarming anyone, do you have an idea?

264
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,920
To spread news only takes one mouth and thus only need one person to pass it on.

265
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,380
From old nannies of 80 to little babies of 3,

266
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:06,059
there is nobody who can't be bribed by me. Be at ease!

267
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,400
You've been guarding all night. Get some rest, I will take your shift.

268
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,779
Me? The greater the emergency,

269
00:21:23,779 --> 00:21:26,220
the more Pneuma of Strength I have.

270
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,880
Something has happened.

271
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,540
I just heard the owner mentioned that someone is asking around

272
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:37,239
about three men and a woman staying in the inns.

273
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,140
We can't stay here anymore.

274
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:47,800
Before the curfew, Minister Xu will be waiting for us at the gate.

275
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,280
We must hang on until then.

276
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:56,600
Your Majesty, I think, we should still go to the (Yuezhou) lodging.

277
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:00,220
We can't hide your identity much longer considering the situation.

278
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:08,259
Valiant Wind Takers. Surpassing Big Dippers.

279
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:11,800
- Valiant Wind Takers. Surpassing Big Dippers.
- What is it?

280
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:15,519
Valiant Wind Takers. Surpassing Big Dippers.

281
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,060
- Valiant Wind Takers. Surpassing Big Dippers.
- Isn't this the Wind Takers' slogan?

282
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:22,080
Why are people saying it in Yuezhou?

283
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,600
Who else do you think it could be? He's here!

284
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,320
Let's take eldest brother and my wife.

285
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,280
We have gotten help.

286
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,420
Valiant Wind Takers. Surpassing Big Dippers.

287
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,119
You are sly to think of such a move.

288
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,100
When dealing with you,

289
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:56,240
certainly, I have to be innovative.

290
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,960
How is the Big Dipper?

291
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,919
Liu Song has sealed it but I escaped.

292
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,030
However, my father and the others are still imprisoned.

293
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:12,060
- How is His Majesty?
- Very good.

294
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:15,479
With me here, he can eat and sleep with ease.

295
00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:19,400
Minister Xu has already agreed that he would escort us out before curfew.

296
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,740
Qin Sang and Qin Qi have already escorted His Majesty to the lodging.

297
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:26,880
If there are no surprises, we can go back to the Big Dipper tonight.

298
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,980
That's good. We can accompany you to see Minister Xu.

299
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,420
We?

300
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,740
Lu Ping.

301
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,680
Lu Ping.

302
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,300
Lu Ping, long time no see.

303
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,300
Long time no see.

304
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,220
Mo Ling and Su Tang are in the city, too.

305
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:49,130
They should be able to recognize your plan.

306
00:23:49,139 --> 00:23:53,540
The four of us from the Wind Taker can finally be reunited.

307
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,160
Isn't that Mo Lin?

308
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,720
Mo Lin!

309
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:07,120
Mo Lin, how did you get hurt?

310
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,880
Weren't you traveling with Su Tang in Yuezhou? Where is she?

311
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,750
Boss, Xu Weifeng is alive.

312
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:16,230
He has met with Zhou Youlong.

313
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:25,590
[Peace and Prosperity]

314
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,100
You don't have to know those details.

315
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:36,100
If Liu Song destroys the Big Dipper and the whole martial arts circles,

316
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:40,300
Tan State and Shuo State will be the next to be in danger.

317
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:48,400
Who exactly is Lu Ping protecting?

318
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,020

My son,

00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:09,840
you're still alive.

322
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,400
As long as you're alive, that's good!

323
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,980
We can't stay in Yuezhou anymore. I will find a way to get you out.

You can go anywhere. Go!

Wherever I go, the Mountain and Sea Gang will still be able to find me.

327
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,400
My only path to stay alive is with you.

328

Zhai Rong is here right now.

Kill him for me and I can live.

Weifeng, how come you still don't understand?

331
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,960
Understand?

332
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,620
How much have I done for the Tan Kingdom?

333
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:52,030
What did I get in return?

334
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,900
Right now, I just want to be a little bit selfish

335
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:57,099
to find a way for me and Su Tang to stay alive. What's wrong with that?

They're here!

I'm the one who asked Zhou Youlong to search the city.

They are bound to come.

00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:19,090
Father, you don't need to do anything.

342
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:21,330
The Mountain and Sea Gang will make a move on their own.

Don't you want me to stay alive?

345
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,700
Lu Ping was right.

346
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:53,040
I have to make up for my son's mistakes.

You… You can't go anywhere.

- Father, save me!
- Let me go!

- Father, you have to save me!
- Let me go.

- Father.
- Minister Xu.

Xu Weifeng, you killed your own father!

354
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,660
What different are you from a beast?

355

I've always been curious.

Su Tang, don't be afraid.

I'm just going to kidnap you for a little while to ask Lu Ping to let us go.

Su Tang, help me one last time. Okay?

If you dare touch my master, I will tear you into ten thousand pieces!

378

Xu Weifeng, you said before that you cared about Su Tang.

379
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:35,040
Now, you're using her life as a bargaining chip.

380
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,500
If you are a man, let her go.

381

Young Master Yan,

You want your sister and I want Zhai Rong.

If you don't agree, just let us go.

Otherwise, no one can have Su Tang.

Of course, not! That is the emperor.

But only when he disagrees, can we leave here alive.

396

Don't be afraid! It is almost done.

You…

You're really willing to exchange the emperor for Su Tang?

To me, ten emperors aren't equal to Su Tang.

Chu Min, will you take it for me?

454

I drew the layout of the Seven Martyr Court.

With the blueprint, after I get Thousand Pine Ruler,

I wish your plan success.

Your hint was so obvious, how could I not understand?

Destroy the leader and the gang will collapse.

Chu Min, there is a mechanism in the secret room storing the Ruler.

476

If you escort him in, when he takes the Ruler, the door will close.

477
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,580
It will be sealed by dissolved iron.

Remember to escape before it the mechanism starts.

How about pushing me in?

481

I don't want to be a part of your Mountain and Sea Gang's dirty deeds.

00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,900
We studied martial arts together.

483
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:59,800
Now, you observe me taking back my weapon.

484
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,360
I suppose this is an ending.

485
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:47,600
Did you really think that I couldn't see through the act you three put on that day?

486
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:52,020
After 19 years, you are still not good at lying.

487
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:56,140
I am just curious how much you're willing to do

488
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:59,080
to deal with me.

489
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,580
Then you already have the answer!

490
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:09,760
In order to fight against the Mountain and Sea Gang,

491
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,720
I'm willing to die.

492
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,600
He must have been poisoned long before.

493
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,920
He kept it in and never said anything.

494
00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:02,200
He exhausted himself when saving His Majesty.

495
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,100
Now, it is too late.

496
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:06,100
Impossible!

497
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:09,339
Mo Lin, you must have some other ways.

498
00:42:09,339 --> 00:42:11,100
I will get whatever medicine you need.

499
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,110
Don't bother!

500
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:19,280
We have already been exposed.

501
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:23,960
We must leave before curfew.

502
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:27,000
There is no time left.

503
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:33,360
Sang'er, I have something to tell you two.

504
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,800
Brother.

505
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:02,600
It is passed onto me by Minister Xu.

506
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:09,080
He must have guessed that the emperor was here.

507
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:18,060
You brat, I've always disliked you

508
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:22,160
but now, I have to entrust Sang'er,

509
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:26,640
His Majesty, and this thing,

510
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,940
all to you.

511
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:47,980
[Ending OST: "The Paper Boat"]
[by Zhiqian Xue — Singers: Zhiqian Xue and Kewei Yu]

512
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:54,100
♫ Waiting to be buried by the lake in the town, ♫

513
00:43:54,100 --> 00:44:00,140
♫ the White Paper Boat drifting with sorrow. ♫

514
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:06,010
♫ Lights on the other side of the sea ♫

515
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:14,660
♫ punched fingertips in the red water tower. ♫

516
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:24,100
♫ Watch the little boat churning, laughing at the ordinariness. ♫

517
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:28,390
♫ Like a kite being pulled into a low altitude, ♫

518
00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:33,790
♫ I smiled to the leaving person. ♫

519
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:38,160
♫ The more spotlight, the more vivid the story. ♫

520
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:43,080
♫ Laughing like the moon, ♫

521
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:47,590
♫ regretting the lighthouse broke in the waves, ♫

522
00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:55,000
♫ I call the Milky Way that isolates us all, blue. ♫

523
00:44:57,390 --> 00:45:02,380
♫ Like a moat built under the sea, ♫

524
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:07,100
♫ waiting for the words on the paper boat to disappear, ♫

525
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:15,120
♫ there must always be someone who doesn’t remember listening to the other. ♫

526
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:21,760
♫ Anyone who is correctly guessed will end in disfavor. ♫

527
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:25,930
♫ You are particularly touched but others consider it ordinary. ♫

528
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:31,270
♫ Like the author, roughly put down with a weak stroke, ♫

529
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:35,650
♫ the writing boat on the lake was just like a paper crane in the air. ♫

530
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:40,510
♫ Laughing like the moon, ♫

531
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:45,240
♫ regretting the lighthouse broke in the waves, ♫

532
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:53,500
♫ I call the Milky Way that isolates us all, blue. ♫

533
00:45:55,060 --> 00:46:00,100
♫ Can a moat be built on the seabed? ♫

534
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:04,540
♫ Wipe all the words on the paper boat! ♫

535
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:11,750
♫ Please let someone not remember and don't tell another! ♫

536
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:18,990
♫ Hide the reluctance between words ♫

537
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:23,600
♫ Unfortunately, I (you) are an average author ♫

538
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:31,610
♫ No matter how you (I) describe the rest, it's unnecessary! ♫

539
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:42,070
♫ Don't describe my unfulfilled promise! ♫

540
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:50,960
♫ Don't interpret my hidden fire-smoke! ♫

541
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:59,890
♫ Don't let the paper boat in the rough wave chasing me! ♫

542
00:46:59,890 --> 00:47:08,530
♫ Don't wait until it's over to know there are you and me! ♫
