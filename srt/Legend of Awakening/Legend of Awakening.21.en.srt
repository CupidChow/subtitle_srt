00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
♫ The dark green sea is hazy ♫

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,750
♫ dissipating in a flash. ♫

4
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:36,630
♫ Rivers and lakes divide the world. ♫

5
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,010
♫ Ten thousands arrows are firing at once. ♫

6
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:43,910
♫ Who has time to worry? Who loves the color of blood? ♫

7
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:47,740
♫ At that time, spirits are high. ♫

8
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:51,600
♫ Who calls the world his home? Who dares let his horse freely run? ♫

9
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,310
♫ Silently, tears form in the death of night. ♫

10
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:58,220
♫ Heroes are cutting all ties, ♫

11
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:02,000
♫ giving up whether it's life or death, ♫

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,130
♫ never asking what the cost is. ♫

13
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:09,830
♫ Good and evil must be distinguished. ♫

14
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:13,710
♫ The wind blows off the snow. ♫

15
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:17,620
♫ On the body, etch multiple scars, ♫

16
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,750
♫ wandering all over the world, ♫

17
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:25,090
♫ only wish to ask for answers from this world. ♫

18
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:29,220
♫ A teenager doesn't have to be a hero. ♫

19
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,090
♫ There is no need for flowers in the dream. ♫

20
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,130
♫ Destiny need not be afraid. ♫

21
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:40,750
♫ Because you have him all the way, ♫

[Episode 21]

29
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:27,780
Elder, I know you still miss my master.

30
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,900
You don't want to believe that he's gone.

31
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,780
I'm not thinking about that old man at all!

32
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,780
He's the one that didn't want to come back!

33
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:41,600
Before master died, he shared some vague things to me.

34
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,340
He told Master Chu Min to bring me to the Big Dipper.

35
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,000
He knew a long time ago that I would end up meeting you.

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,820
He used you to stimulate my competitiveness,

37
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,000
leading me to the Seven Martyr Court.

38
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,360
He temporarily sealed my pneumatic powers through the connecting to the star of destiny.

39
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:01,040
It was so that I can practice the Pneuma of Sound to the highest point,

40
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,720
and get the Linked Camp Horn.

41
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:15,240
Guo Wushu, your brother had a lot of plans.

42
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,540
He wanted Lu Ping to gain perseverance.

43
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,500
He wanted me to take my responsibility.

44
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,880
He also wanted to make you understand

45
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,000
with the help of Lu Ping.

46
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,800
Elder,

47
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:34,320
in my opinion, years ago when master made the bet with you,

48
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:39,200
he wanted you to train yourself here without thinking too much.

49
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,320
Then, he sent me here to meet you now.

50
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,760
It was his way of telling you

51
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,480
since you've already accomplished a lot,

52
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,040
maybe it's time to let go of your obsession.

55
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:15,360

Elder,

63
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,840
if you still feel bad,

64
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:35,240
I can be your disciple from now on

65
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,480
and compete with you.

No need.

69
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,920
I already have a disciple.

70
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,520
Let's go back.

71
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,860
Master, we can't just let Lu Ping go like that.

72
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,859
- I still haven't settled my debt with him.
- What?

73
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,790
Your parents were killed by the Mountain and Sea Gang so you should take it up with them.

74
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,470
What debt do you have with Lu Ping?

75
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,519
- But, Master—
- Go back.

76
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:34,120
It's time for training.

77
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,840
Training?

78
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,460
What? We still have a competition.

79
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:44,319
I lost to him this time but next time, I can't lose again.

80
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,480
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

81
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,700
Although you are a bit useless,

82
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,640
you still have a strong heart.

83
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,260
Guo Youdao painstakingly trained his disciple.

84
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,120
How can I lose to him?

85
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:09,220
It's about time I find someone

86
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,980
to inherit the Kaiyang Peak skills.

87
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,680
Yes, Master.

88
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:20,280
Master Chu Min, I still have some questions.

89
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,800
Why do I still remember the tune made by the Linked Camp Horn?

90
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,240
Why was the power of Pneuma Confinement within me

91
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,540
able to resonate with the Linked Camp Horn and break itself?

92
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:35,560
Why did master insist that I take Master Leng's weapon and not something else?

93
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,059
- Why do I—
- There is no reason for all those "why's".

94
00:07:38,059 --> 00:07:43,100
Sometimes, fate will find its own way naturally.

95
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,760
Master,

96
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,720
what kind of person was Master Leng?

97
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:58,080
He was upright, honest, and unrivaled in the whole pugilist world.

98
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,180
He deserved the name of hero

99
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:05,040
and the respect of millions of people.

100
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,480
Go on! Bow to your Master and...

101
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,600
kowtow to Pavilion Master Leng.

102
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,600
Yes.

103
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,360
Thank you, Pavilion Master Leng, for your weapon.

104
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,500
I will definitely put it into good use and won't let it just collect dust.

105
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:40,320
Master Chu Min, why are you crying?

106
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,130
Whether or not I cry is none of your business.

107
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:47,099
You are sick! Hurry back and rest.

108
00:08:47,099 --> 00:08:50,760
Whatever you want to do next, I don't care.

109
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,060
However, you have to remember,

110
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,420
you only have one life.

111
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,530
Plan well before you act.

112
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:01,860
Don't act rashly!

113
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,360
What about you, Master?

114
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,880
I've been lazy for too long,

115
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,740
but I am, at least, the master of a peak.

116
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:22,120
Some responsibilities, I have to take on.

[Shao Yinchu] [Leng Xiutan] [Guo Youdao]

119
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,800
How is Elder Guo?

120
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,100
He has probably thought things through.

121
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:01,480
Something seems to have happened at the Fifth Institute.

122
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,919
Eldest Senior left the Big Dipper just now.

123
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:11,900
Everything was fine so why did he leave so suddenly?

124
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:15,460
It's probably because he secretly learned your skills but still lost in the end.

125
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:18,200
He was probably too embarrassed to stay.

126
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:26,920
Eldest Senior indeed had no morality but he had his own difficulties.

127
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,840
A letter from our Eldest Senior, why don't you take a look?

128
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,060
Dear my fellow classmates, I was not skilled enough to win.

129
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:39,719
I set a bad example for you and don't deserve the position of your eldest senior.

130
00:10:39,719 --> 00:10:42,160
Recently, there have been frequent battles between the Shuo and Tan.

131
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,270
There are refugees near the border of Yuezhou.

132
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,600
My heart ached when I heard about this.

133
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,400
Since I made no achievement at the Big Dipper, why don't I join the front lines?

134
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,700
At least, with my meager power, I'll be of some help to the people.

135
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,620
It was an honor to study under the same pavilion as all of you.

136
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,340
You'll always be in my heart.

137
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,480
Goodbye and farewell.

138
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,240
Yours, Xu Weifeng.

139
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,730
Eldest Senior is the only son from the Xu Family in Jiangning.

140
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:11,260
He can be considered as a son of a noble family.

141
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,220
Xu Family in Jiangning?

142
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:19,640
Is he the son of Xu Yanling, the Military Minister of Tan?

143
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,680
You are knowledgeable, Miss Qin. That's correct!

144
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,820
Why did he come here to the Big Dipper instead of becoming an official?

145
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,960
You may not know the story.

146
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,820
Eldest Senior has always wanted to join the army

147
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:35,900
but unfortunately, he couldn't join the army because of his childhood asthma.

148
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:39,840
Several years ago when he came here to the Big Dipper, he practiced vigorously.

149
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:44,020
He always hoped that after he got the Linked Camp Horn, he'd be able to improve his cultivation.

150
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:48,260
This way, he would qualify to join the army

151
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:52,179
but who knew that you would get it first.

152
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,750
There are so many weapons in the Seven Martyr Court.

153
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,320
Why must you insist on the Linked Camp Horn?

154
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,560
It's because it's the most powerful.

155
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,800
- You must have a reason, right?
- Does that matter?

156
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,879
There is only one Linked Camp Horn so how can there be a fair competition?

157
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:13,760
On the battlefield, there are only wins and losses, no morals.

158
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,220
No wonder he said that there are no morals on the battlefield

159
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,400
but only wins and losses.

160
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:28,220
Senior Huo, you know all those trivial things

161
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,360
but you never mentioned any of these important things.

162
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,520
Eldest Senior keeps a low profile and dislikes showing off.

163
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,340
Moreover,

164
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:40,060
who knew a Junior Lu would appear?

165
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,440
He had just entered Seven Martyrs Court and hadn't recovered.

166
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,960
Lu Ping, where are you going?

167
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:52,060
Although I didn't know him before, he was here before me.

168
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:56,480
And I, the latter, got the fruit so I need to show I care.

169
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,320
Do you want to go with me?

170
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:06,800
My father and brother also taught me to protect justice.

171
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,700
From that standpoint, I am not as good as that Young Lord Xu.

172
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:16,220
Since you want to look for him, I will go with you.

173
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,860
Senior Huo,

174
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,980
do you also want to help?

175
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:25,780
Because you helped the refugees, you were punished and sent here.

176
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:28,420
And Senior Zimu, Senior Jin Qi,

177
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:31,480
don't we all want to go out of here?

178
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,820
I want to go.

179
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,340
Me, too.

180
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,980
We will go, too.

181
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,800
Lu Ping, can we come, too?

182

[Yuezhou]
Order from the general!

183
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:00,239
- No one can enter the city.
- Back off! Back off!

- Don't push.
- Back off.

Please!

188
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,920
Master, you have some first.

189
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,660
I have told you many times that I'm not your master.

190
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:35,519
You agreed so you can't deny it.

191
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:40,779
After all, I can't get a disciple of my own so having a master is the same then.

192
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,360
Why don't you eat?

193
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:57,880
We don't have enough money but fortunately, we are near the Big Dipper.

194
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,740
Furthermore, I am healthy so I can bear it.

195
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,410
I just need some water.

196
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,859
- No need.
- Take it!

197
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,520
Master, I know you care about me.

198
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,319
Steal from me? How dare you! You want to die?

199

People train their sight first when learning martial arts.

200

She was just hungry.

201
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,720
Are you okay?

202
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,740
Don't be afraid! It's okay.

203
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:55,380
If it is not enough, I'll give these to you, too.

204
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:01,620

- Back off!
- No entry.

209
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:18,219
Young Lord, during the war between the two countries, refugees lost their homes.

210
00:16:18,219 --> 00:16:20,719
I came to Yuezhou after many difficulties.

211
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,139
I never thought that General Xu Tianbing would refuse to let us in.

212
00:16:24,139 --> 00:16:26,240
The environment outside is really bad, there's been an epidemic outbreak.

213
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,490
Many people have died of starvation or illness.

214
00:16:28,499 --> 00:16:30,799
- Back off!
- Don't enter! Don't push!

215
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:32,120
Stop shouting!

216
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,460
When there is war between the two countries, it's always the people who will suffer.

217
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:40,020
- Don't push!
- Everyone, follow me!

218
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,860
Master,

219
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:55,120
it's such a pity that they are poor, but we don't have money or food.

220
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,360
There's nothing we can do to help.

221
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,360
Don't we still have strength?

222
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,910
You've shouted all day long

223
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:15,140
and made my head ache.

224
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:19,040
General Xu, these are refugees who've lost their homes because of the war.

225
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,130
Many are old and sick.

226
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:24,000
Please show mercy and let them in.

[Xu Tianbing - General of Yuezhou]

228

It is war time so who know if there are Shou spies among these people?

229
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:37,520
General, you can't see them dying and not help.

230
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,660
I think you are a spy.

Men, capture him!

232

Don't bother talking with such men who lack compassion.

If he doesn't open the door, I will push it open.

instead of showing off before our people.

It’s just that he’s naturally weak.

- However, he's already slept for several hours.

You almost broke your arm because of the fall.

According to my master, we learn martial arts so that we can help those in need.

Although they can't repay us,

We don't need to take repayment from the poor.

00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,439
Don't worry! My brother and Qin Sang have already dealt with it.

318
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:43,220
You just need to rest.

319
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,320
Lu Ping is your brother?

320
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,000
What about Miss Qin?

321
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,360
Her?

322
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,780
Just a follower of my brother.

323
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,060
Strange! Who is cursing me?

324
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,620
Are you okay?

325
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,460
I'm okay?

326
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:06,860
My brother helped numerous refugees before.

327
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:10,720
I learned a lot by his side.

328
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:16,940
Sir Lu and Miss Qin, thank you for your help.

329
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:19,120
On behalf of everyone, I thank you.

330
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,679
- Bao Niang, please get up.
- Please get up.

331
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,120
Please get up. Stand up.

332
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,740
It is Senior Xu who saved you all. I was just passing by to lent a hand.

333
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:30,370
It is our fortune to have kind

334
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:32,520
people like you and Miss Qin.

335
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,180
It's nothing. It's nothing.

336
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:38,620
Are you embarrassed?

337
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:42,720
Bao Niang, we've been in the Fifth Institute so long and haven't been praised in a long time.

338
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,780
What about praising us?

339
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,240
Come on! Come on!

340
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,740
Let's go and thank them.

341
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,919
Bao Niang thank you, Young Heroes, for your help.

342
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,880
Thank you for all your help.

343
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,660
You didn't care about such things before.

344
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:03,020
I got the weapon of their master.

345
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:06,640
That said, I am homeless now.

346
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,660
It is good to help others get home.

347
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:17,540
Lu Ping, you have changed.

348
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:23,220
But I like this new you.

349
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:31,620
I can't stand it. I can't stand it. I really can't stand it.

350
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:34,019
What's wrong now? Master and I searched for you all this way.

351
00:26:34,019 --> 00:26:37,980
She said she missed you but now, she stays in the room with that pretty boy, refusing to leave.

352
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,720
Ungrateful girl!

353
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,320
What?

354
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,360
What are you saying, Mo Lin?

355
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,020
Boss, do you see?

356
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:52,659
- What is it?
- Brother, did you hear what he just said?

357
00:26:52,659 --> 00:26:55,460
She just knows how to hurt people with her beauty and bully me.

358
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:58,080
- You!
- Wait a moment.

359
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,940
- Why did you come to Yuezhou?
- I was about to tell you.

360
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:03,780
It's Xifan's father who told us to come.

361
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:11,319
It was like that that we got close to the Big Dipper.

362
00:27:11,319 --> 00:27:14,919
We didn't think we would encounter the refugees and met up with you here.

363
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:16,880
You mentioned the Mountain and Sea Gang?

364
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,580
Senior, you may not know.

365
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:21,220
The Mountain and Sea Gang used to be an evil gang in the north.

366
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:23,320
They use their martial arts to raid others.

367
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:27,280
Anyone who gets a Mountain Sea Gang token, will either disappear or be killed.

368
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:31,700
Lu Ping… he was tortured by them before.

369
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,220
Let's not talk about this.

370
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:39,340
Not long before, when I took part in the Pneuma Combat Convention with my fellow disciples,

371
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:42,620
I also found that the gang had spies in the court.

372
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:45,220
Thankfully, we stopped their plan.

373
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:49,440
My sect before was also destroyed because of it.

374
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,800
My master even died.

375
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:56,739
It is said that the Mountain and Sea Gang have been sending their spies all around Shuo state.

376
00:27:56,739 --> 00:27:59,860
What are they doing here in Yuezhou?

377
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:04,920
On my way to Yuezhou, I heard the two states had started negotiations.

378
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,680
They will finish the peace talks in Yuezhou in a few days.

379
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:11,140
The gang may be planning to do something

380
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,540
during the negotiations.

381
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:19,500
The Mountain and Gang, they're not only sending spies out,

382
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,640
but they're also doing evil things at the border.

383
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,800
Indeed, they never change!

384
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:27,080
Senior Huo Ying, this is very important.

385
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:31,480
Would you go back to Big Dipper first and tell Master Chu Min and Pavilion Master Li?

386
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,020
People from the Mountain and Sea Gang are skilled fighters.

387
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:39,440
I'm afraid the army defenses may not be enough and we'll need help from the Big Dipper.

388
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,460
Qin Sang and I will stay here

389
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,300
and search for information.

390
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:50,020
I should have been with you but I have to make arrangements for the refugees.

391
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:54,280
It's no big deal! My assassin brother is good at medicine.

392
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,100
He can help you.

393
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:59,520
I… Why me?

394
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,400
Older Brother, I will help Brother Xu as well.

395
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,280
I was thinking the same.

396
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,039
Xu Family has some friends here.

397
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,840
If you need it, we'll help however we can.

398
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:14,039
By the way, my father has set off from Jiangning for the diplomatic mission.

399
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:16,580
I will also tell my father

400
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:19,560
to take precautions and be careful.

401
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:23,939
What a coincidence! My brother will arrive here in Yuezhou for the mission, too.

402
00:29:23,939 --> 00:29:28,300
With his help, the Mountain and Sea Gang will have nowhere to go.

403
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:32,400
Good! Since each person knows his place,

404
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,900
let's take advantage of the time by splitting up to do this.

405
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,320
Sure.

406
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,160
Lu Ping,

407
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:52,120
I've always wanted to say that…

408
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,650
Say what?

409
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:58,560
I'm actually here to help my brother lobby you.

410
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,840
He hopes to cooperate with you in destroying the Mountain and Sea Gang.

411
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,480
You already know that I won't cooperate with him.

412
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:10,420
I know! It was over the top for him to arrest you before.

413
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:13,420
But what he did, it was for the country.

414
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:15,960
Before, I thought you were a spy from the Mountain and Sea Gang.

415
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:19,020
- Didn't you forgive me for that?
- Qin Sang,

416
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,719
I am a disciple of the Big Dipper.

417
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,179
According to our rules, disciples are not allowed to interfere in politics.

418
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,640
I don't want to have anything to do with the court.

419
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,640
I just want to be an ordinary man.

420
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:33,500
Regarding the Mountain and Sea Gang, I'll take care of it my way.

421
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:40,000
By the way, Senior Xu said that you can get the most information at the teahouse.

422
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,340
Would you like to have a cup of tea and investigate with me?

423
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,719
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

424
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,560
Thank you.

425
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:58,000
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

426
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:04,340
Pretty boy.

427
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,740
Brother Xu!

428
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,539
- There's enough for everyone!
- Thanks.

429
00:31:17,539 --> 00:31:19,320
Don't hurry!

430
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:24,800
Miss Su, can you really bring down the wall, like Mo Lin said?

431
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,500
You have helped so many people.

432
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,380
That's all I can really do, it's not much.

433
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,660
This is good.

434
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:38,880
After the negotiation, the refugees can go home.

435
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,820
That isn't certain yet.

436
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:43,380
- Why not?
- You don't understand.

437
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:49,520
War or peace between two countries is always related to profit.

438
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:54,080
They may negotiate today but might fight each other tomorrow.

439
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,359
- The ones who suffer…
- Here, take it!

440
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,360
are always the ordinary people.

441
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:04,100
When the world's in chaos, it can't be helped.

442
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:08,960
In this world, what comes together will come apart, what comes apart will come together.

443
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,140
But I always believe that one day, there will be an able man

444
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,480
who can unite the world.

445
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,940
He will reign over the whole land

446
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:23,100
and people will not suffer again.

447
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:27,880
Brother Xu, what you said is so profound.

448
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:33,710
I still think that temporary peace is still better than continuous war.

449
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:37,640
At least, people won't be displaced,

450
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,860
loved ones can stay together,

451
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:44,760
and there will be a few less orphans like my brother and I.

452
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:48,699
Trust me! This will definitely happen.

453
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:54,720
Brother Xu, can you do me a favor?

454
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,500
Please do tell!

455
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:01,220
Come on, over here!

456
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,720
Well… Brother Xu,

457
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:11,460
Bao Niang lost all her relatives during exile.

458
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:15,380
Can you give her a job to do here?

459
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:20,180
I seldom live in this mansion and I don't really need servants.

460
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:24,880
But since you and your brother are here,

461
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,440
I do need a cook.

462
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:30,600
Would you like to be the cook?

463
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,780
That's great! Thank you very much, Brother Xu.

464
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:36,540
Young Master, I will not forget what you've done for me.

465
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:40,140
Mister, Miss Su is beautiful and kind.

466
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:42,220
Don't lose her!

467
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:47,140
What? Lose what?

468
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,300
Here!

469
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,560
This is for you.

470
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,520
What is it? Your reward.

471
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:06,640
You are beautiful, kind, and willing to help people.

472
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,979
The refugees can't repay you so I will repay you.

473
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,530
Then, I will give you half.

474
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:28,190
Good boy! Stop crying. It's okay.

475
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:30,630
It's okay.

476
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:36,360
- Stop crying. Stop crying.
- Don't cry! Don't cry.

477
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,560
Okay?

478
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:42,430
[Pure Wind Courtyard]

479
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:09,060
Master, about giving everyone sugar every day,

480
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,560
can you not do that?

481
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:16,340
Look! We four are from the Wind Taker Institute.

482
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:20,600
So outsiders don't need to enjoy this treatment right?

483
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:24,319
He helped my brother and my brother helped him.

484
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,740
He's not an outsider anymore.

485
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,240
Then, let me phrase it another way.

486
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:40,040
From now on, except for your brother,

487
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,320
and at most, our Eldest Senior,

488
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,560
can you only give me sugar?

489
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:52,460
Mo Lin, you're getting stranger and stranger.

490
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:56,060
Just say what you want to say, I can't understand what you're saying.

491
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:59,640
I… just want... just want...

492
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,180
Even if I told you, you wouldn't understand.

493
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:06,680
Let it go! Let it go!

494
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:16,360
You really are strange.

495
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,960
Thank God! It wasn't broken.

496
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:53,280
What are you worried about?

497
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,880
Our enemies are in the dark while we're easily seen.

498
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,480
We're not clear about their whereabouts

499
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:02,720
and even more unclear about what they want.

500
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,560
We are flying about like aimless flies.

501
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,440
This feeling...

502
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,220
is really uncomfortable.

503
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:14,660
It's during times like this that we should be steady.

504
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:17,040
Be patient!

505
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:20,240
The truth will always show itself.

506
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,720
Enemies will always show themselves.

507
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:29,140
I haven't apologized to you

508
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:31,340
about the Horn.

509
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,699
I wasn't good enough and lost to you.

510
00:37:34,699 --> 00:37:37,059
Besides, you helped me with the refugees.

511
00:37:37,059 --> 00:37:39,460
I'm already thankful.

512
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:43,260
By the way, how about if I got to General Xu tomorrow

513
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,039
and see if he can help you?

514
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:48,200
This favor, he should agree, too.

515
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,980
Many thanks.

516
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:53,819
We are all from the Fifth Institute.

517
00:37:53,819 --> 00:37:57,380
Your matters are my matters.

518
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:06,580
You've already exhausted yourself and you still act strong.

519
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,400
You are so much like Xifan.

520
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,380
Xifan?

521
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,100
Is he your Senior from the Wind Taker Institute?

522
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:20,140
In this world,

523
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:23,240
he was my first real friend.

524
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:29,360
He put himself in danger to help me

525
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,840
infiltrate the Mountain and Sea Gang.

526
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:35,580
But I recently received a secret letter from him

527
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:39,080
saying he'll be meeting up with us soon.

528
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,080
I will introduce you to him then.

529
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,720
You two will definitely hit it off.

530
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:49,139
Lu Ping, Lu Ping.

531
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,340
I received a letter written in blood.

532
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:54,520
Something happened to Xifan.

533
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,440
Eldest Senior!

534
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,480
Eldest Senior!

535
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,740
Eldest Senior.

536
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,600
Eldest Senior!

537
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,520
Eldest Senior.

538
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:53,620
Who hurt you?

539
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,299
I infiltrated the Mountain and Sea Gang.

540
00:39:58,299 --> 00:40:00,380
With the help of my father,

541
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:03,340
everything was going well.

542
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:07,900
I had figured out all the secret paths in and out of there.

543
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:12,900
My father asked me to leave early but I was too greedy.

544
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:16,680
I even wanted to kill the leader for you and end all the things.

545
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:21,000
What a pity! I miscalculated a step.

546
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,700
It wasn't easy to escape

547
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:26,220
and I haven't even had time to see my father.

548
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:28,160
I came to find you first.

549
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,220
It's good that you are alive.

550
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:33,340
Eldest Senior, you don't know how much I worry about you.

551
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:35,810
Thank the Heavens and Earth,

552
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:38,080
you are still alive.

553
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:41,680
By the way, where are Su Tang and Mo Lin?

554
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,080
I left them in Yuezhou.

555
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,320
Might as well!

556
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,760
Zhou Youlong might come at any time.

557
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,100
It is not safe here.

558
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:55,800
Eldest Senior, how did you know that

559
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,400
I was in Yuezhou Mansion?

560
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:22,020
Lu Ping,

561
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,480
I really did underestimate you.

562
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,079
When did you figure it out?

563
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:30,220
I have been staying at the Big Dipper Academy since the time Master Chu Min brought me there.

564
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:34,260
Coming to Yuezhou was a last minute decision.

565
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:35,780
Su Tang was looking for me all the way here.

566
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:40,520
If they hadn't encountered the refugees, we couldn't have had the chance to meet in Yuezhou.

567
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:43,550
All of these previous coincidences,

568
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:47,820
if you hadn't investigated first, how would you have known any of them?

569
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:53,800
I suspected you when we received your letter directly at Senior Xu's mansion.

570
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,760
So I had Qin Sang follow me from behind.

571
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:00,139
- Never thought that you really—
- Lu Ping,

572
00:42:00,139 --> 00:42:03,200
you are indeed the same Lu Ping.

573
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,650
(You are) always so careful with every movement.

574
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:15,960
Xifan, what did the Mountain and Sea Gang give you to make you sell out your juniors?

575
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:18,680
They just warned me that you were

576
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:22,040
to blame for the destruction of the Wind Takers.

577
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:27,879
Only when the awakener is captured by the Mountain and Sea Gang, can the world be peaceful again.

578
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:32,840
Eldest Senior, the Mountain and Sea Gang are really the ones who destroyed the Wind Taker Institute.

579
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:36,239
Wake up! Don't be fooled by them.

580
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,860
You don't think that in order to catch you,

581
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:42,460
I wouldn't have prepared appropriately?

582
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:53,240
Yan Xifan, you dare betray your own junior!

583
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:56,840
Looks like, I really did pick the right person!

584
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:05,719
What are you still thinking? Hurry up to capture him!

585
