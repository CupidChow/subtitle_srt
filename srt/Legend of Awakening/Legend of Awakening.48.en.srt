00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,980
♫ The dark green sea is hazy ♫

3
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,780
♫ dissipating in a flash ♫

4
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:36,640
♫ Rivers and lakes divide the world ♫

5
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,000
♫ Ten thousands arrows are firing at once ♫

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
♫ Who has time to worry?
Who loves the color of blood? ♫

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,770
♫ At that time, spirits are high ♫

8
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:51,600
♫ Who calls the world his home?
Who dares let his horse freely run? ♫

9
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,340
♫ Silently, tears form in the death of night ♫

10
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:58,230
♫ Heroes are cutting all ties, ♫

11
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,100
♫ giving up whether it's life or death, ♫

12
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,160
♫ never asking what the cost is ♫

13
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:09,900
♫ Good and evil must be distinguished ♫

14
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,740
♫ The wind blows off the snow ♫

15
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,670
♫ On the body, etch multiple scars, ♫

16
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,700
♫ wandering all over the world, ♫

17
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:25,300
♫ only wish to ask for answers from this world ♫

18
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:29,170
♫ A teenager doesn't have to be a hero ♫

19
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:33,100
♫ There is no need for flowers in the dream ♫

20
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,090
♫ Destiny need not be afraid ♫

21
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:40,700
♫ Because you have him all the way, ♫

[Episode 48 - Final Episode]

29
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,500
Might as well be happy this one time.

30
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,090
As long as you're here,

31
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,900
this is reality.

32
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,860
What heroic spirit! It can't even stand up to such insignificant, ordinary thoughts.

33
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,460
Lu Ping.

34
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,380
You want to be an ordinary person, I can give that to you.

35
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:08,340
On the other hand, can you give me what I want?

36
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,100
I never thought that I would return to this hellhole again.

37
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,520
Are you afraid?

38
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,460
If it weren't for my brother, I would have died inside a long time ago.

39
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:55,720
After I met my brother, every day is a gift to me.

40
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,960
Right now my brother needs me, of course, I will return it to him.

41
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,720
Don't worry! I won't let you return all of it today.

42
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,200
It looks like they knew that we were coming.

43
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,080
The Master invites you both inside.

44
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:04,500
We have distinguished guests today.

45
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,200
One is the Mountain and Sea Gang's traitor.

46
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:12,300
The other can be considered as an old friend of the Gang.

47
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:22,260
With what identity do you come for visiting me today?

48
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,780
The general of Shuo?

49
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,300
The Young Master of the Yan Family?

50
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:35,059
According to the rules of the Wind Taker Academy, no one can be left behind.

51
00:05:35,059 --> 00:05:39,280
As the Eldest Senior, I am coming to take Lu Ping home.

52
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:45,780
Fine! I'll send you guys home.

53
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,259
Lu Ping? Are you insane?

54
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,760
Wonderful!

55
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,920
Really wonderful!

56
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:03,800
Brotherhood is such a delightful thing.

57
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,919
You never disappoint me.

58
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:57,679
Thanks to your blood, I can use six pneumas and walk easily.

59
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,860
Now is the time for me to get the land of Dan back.

60
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,300
What a pity!

61
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,000
I'm not interested in being a stepping stone for you to seize the country.

62
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,200
I have experienced the life you showed me.

63
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:06,200
Parents. Master.

64
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:10,840
As beautiful as they might be, the are still all fake.

65
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,540
Because the real ones are still here.

66
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:35,620
Pneuma of Bravery. Impossible!

67
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:38,150
The Pneuma of Bravery is just a legend.

68
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:40,690
No one can acquire it.

69
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:50,680
It is given to me by my beloved at the price of her life.

70
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:55,980
How would people like you, heartless, ruthless, and without love,

71
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,760
be able to ever understand?

72
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,640
Lu Ping, I know that the Heavens have treated you unfairly.

73
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,220
You've suffered a lot.

74
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:13,550
However, you and I were still able to find each other in this world.

75
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:16,200
Everything we've experienced together is here.

76
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,670
Just consider it as protecting this world for me.

77
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,640
Is that a good enough reason?

78
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:35,320
Bandit, don't get too attached to the Pneuma of Essence.

79
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,320
Do you remember what you promised me?

80
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,660
How could Lu Ping from the Wind Taker Institute,

81
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,460
be so indulged in an illusion?

82
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,120
None of this is real.

83
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:03,260
As long as you're here, this is reality.

84
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:05,400
Didn't I promise you?

85
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:09,900
As long as you remember the path you should take, I will always be with you.

86
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:13,960
Actually, I have always been here.

87
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:28,180
If the six pneumas are like a river, the Pneuma of Floweris like the sea.

88
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,800
The six pneumas control a human's six senses.

89
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,900
The Pneuma of Bravery controls one's heart.

90
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:39,340
It reminded me that I should remember the path I chose.

91
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:42,990
Even if I am faced with extreme hardships,

92
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:44,940
I will never retreat.

93
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:48,340
No matter how powerful the Pneuma of Essence is,

94
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,020
it still can't conquer my heart.

95
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,620
Liu Song, you've lost!

96
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:03,200
Lost? How is that possible?

97
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,399
The Pneuma of Bravery can only help you transition between your six pneumas more freely.

98
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:11,260
It does nothing to help the cultivation of your martial arts.

99
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:16,000
The outcome of a fight between just the two of us is still uncertain.

100
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,190
You are wrong.

101
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:46,040
I still have my friends.

102
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:50,080
You dare trick me?

103
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:54,360
If I hadn't died, how could you be so careless?

104
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,580
I will give you another surprise.

105
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,240
Mo Lin?

106
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,140
Great Hero, well done!

107
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:57,119
You have thought through everything but you never imagined that I would be so lucky.

108
00:14:57,119 --> 00:14:59,930
Mo Family is the descendant of Tiancan. We can't use the Pneuma of Strength.

109
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:01,890
We can't use the Pneuma of Strength.

110
00:15:01,899 --> 00:15:05,840
Because of that, the meridian can bear all kinds of poisons.

111
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:12,060
Although this silly boy still has a chance to live,

112
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,510
he can't hold on for long.

113
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:17,340
I'll have to take the risk again.

114
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,720
You brat!

115
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:10,220
When you wake up, just leave the valley and go exploring.

116
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:15,160
I've always known that you wanted to be a hero.

117
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,480
From now on,

118
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,660
I won't stop you.

119
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:43,980
The day you destroyed Carefree Valley, was the day I woke up.

120
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:47,460
My father gave me most of his Pneuma of Strength.

121
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:51,200
He lost his own life because of it.

122

♫ The storm doesn't calm down and the fate is intertwined ♫

124
00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:10,520
How strange! Why is my Pneuma of Pivot getting stronger?

♫ You swung the sword like the rain, and I remember your silhouette when you turn around ♫

127
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,850
After I buried my family, I left the valley.

128
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:33,000
When it came to taking revenge and addressing this hatred, how could I not take part?

How did you get together with Yan Xifan?

132
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:55,050
♫ When leaving, I was young and full of vitality, with the sword pointing to the broad sky ♫

♫ When returning, I'm already old with grey hair
and flaky memory ♫

If we can get Jin back, we'll still have to take on the Mountain and Sea Gang.

135
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,100
Eldest Senior, what plans do you have?

136
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,410
I still have a secret weapon.

137

♫ impermanent like the bubbles ♫

00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,559
If you're going to go against the Mountain and Sea Gang, how could you do it without the world's best assassin?

140

♫ Encountered on a narrow road, we fight with

♫ Living through the mundane world,
we struggled to help each other ♫

142
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:51,200
Darling, didn't I say, as long as I have seen you in your wedding dress,

143
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,100
my luck would grow a hundred times that even hell won't want me.

144
00:18:55,100 --> 00:19:01,680
Lu Ping, your blood of awakening enables me to use six pneumas.

145
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:06,500
With only a few silver needles, do you think you can imprison me?

146
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:12,420
You all are too naive!

147
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,540
What is this?

148
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:54,320
You should be quite familiar with it, the Pneuma Confinement.

149
00:19:54,320 --> 00:20:00,280
I forgot to tell you that my father gave it to me before he died.

150
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:05,020
Boss just used all his strength which made the lock even stronger.

151
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,850
You'd better stay still. The confinement has broken all your meridians.

152
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:09,300
Right now, the confinement has broken all of your meridians.

153
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,380
You're useless now.

154
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,200
Back then, Lu Ping's parents and Master Mo

155
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,360
used the lock to protect him.

156
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,500
Now, Lu Ping is using it to lock you up.

157
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,320
This really is karma.

158
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,360
Boss, Liu Song is just a waste of a man now.

159
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,419
I've already set a fire outside. Let's retreat!

160
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,519
If I had known you would work for the foe,

161
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:51,300
I would've let you die in Seven Martyr Court that year.

162
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,500
Liu Song,

163
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:01,920
your heart is too small.

164
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,400
It can only be filled with hatred.

165
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:14,640
Which is why Zhai Rong is more suited to take the throne than you.

166
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:19,780
Lu Ping, don't worry!

167
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:23,159
I know that you didn't come to kill people tonight.

168
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,220
See? It is so cold tonight.

169
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,150
Let's have a warm drink.

170
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:37,080
I'm already aware of your plan.

171
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,540
I am still curious though.

172
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:42,820
Why did you change your mind?

173
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:47,860
I'm not helping you but the people in the country.

174
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:55,320
After Qin Sang died, I owe her a life and an explanation.

175
00:21:56,100 --> 00:22:00,400
All this time, I have seen the cruelty of Liu Song.

176
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,220
I've also thought it through.

177
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,460
If we need a good emperor in all this chaos,

178
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:10,420
then I believe in the one she and Xifan have chosen.

179
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,160
Good!

180
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:19,740
If you can let it go, I can, too.

181
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:25,490
To kill Liu Song, you'll have to cross the border.

182
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:30,959
That means that the Army of Shuo can't protect you.

183
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,500
When that time comes, you'll have to fight alone.

184
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,680
Have you thought it through?

185
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,830
Things in the pugilist world have to be solved in the pugilist world.

186
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:41,190
People from the pugilist world should die in the pugilist world.

187
00:22:41,199 --> 00:22:43,400
The trouble started in the pugilist world.

188
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,100
It should be ended there.

189
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:52,279
Good! I will let the Mountain and Sea Gang live.

190
00:22:52,279 --> 00:22:55,740
I put on one more act by torturing you to gain the enemy's confidence.

191
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:59,000
It is so that you can easily get into the Mountain and Sea gang.

192
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:03,180
However, when that time comes, whether you live or die, it will all depend on you.

193
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:07,680
You should take good care of yourself.

194
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:14,160
Do you know what the biggest difference between us is?

195
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,260
We both have hatred.

196
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,340
However, I want to be human

197
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,480
but you'd rather be a ghost.

198
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,830
So now,

199
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:35,040
you should go back to where you belong.

200
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,980
Hold on!

201
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:40,000
Boss, it's said that you let Wei Tianqi carried my wife on his back.

202
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,960
Who did you hear that from? Such a jealous man!

203
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,579
I am her husband and I haven't even had the first night with her.

204
00:26:48,579 --> 00:26:52,579
How can you let that guy take advantage of her? I can't tolerate it.

205
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,900
If you can carry her, then you do it.

206
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:02,899
Fine then! Let me, the best assassin who killed Liu Song, carry you.

207
00:27:02,899 --> 00:27:05,359
How is it, Darling? Isn't it honorable?

208
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,979
- Did you do that on purpose?
- Not at all!

209
00:27:12,979 --> 00:27:16,840
- You totally did that on purpose!
- Really, I didn't!

210
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,240
- Mo Lin!
- I didn't!

211
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:22,580
- Stop right there!
- Darling, I didn't.

212
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,710
You did it on purpose.

213
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:25,740
- I didn't.
- Stop running!

214
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:28,279
Mo Lin, you did it on purpose.

215
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:30,280
Darling.

216
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,600
Lu Ping.

217
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,920
Eldest Senior, can't you not lean on me?

218
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:51,080
I also have a hole in my chest.

219
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,060
It hurts pretty badly, too.

220
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:57,680
My injury is worse.

221
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,920
In addition, it was caused by you.

222
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,420
Then let's both not lean on each other.

223
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,120
It was Master who got me and Su Tang out back then.

224
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:23,120
That's right.

225
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:28,020
Master took you and I, back to the Wind Taker Academy together.

226
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,500
Those times were really great.

227
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,960
After we leave,

228
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:43,060
we should split up again.

229
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,580
You already knew that though,

230
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:59,440
didn't you?

231
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,560
The one who tried to assassinate the emperor

232
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:12,160
can't really return in a fair and just manner.

233
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:15,820
His Majesty also needs a reason

234
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:20,620
to chase the rest of the Mountain and Sea Gang.

235
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:27,720
I will leave with Su Tang and Mo Lin.

236
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:32,520
It's what's the best for everyone.

237
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,720
Where are you going from here then?

238
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,400
Have you heard of the Double Stars of Kaiyang?

239
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:54,600
Yes! One is major and the other is minor.

240
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,910
One is bright and the other is dark.

241
00:29:56,910 --> 00:30:02,760
You chose to be an official, then I will choose to stay in the pugilist world.

242
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:07,400
Fighting for the ordinary people,

243
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,440
it is the same anywhere.

244
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:17,640
You can hit your stride in the court.

245
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,690
I can stay in the pugilist world

246
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,980
and be carefree.

247
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:38,600
Eldest Senior, I can't really bear to leave you.

248
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,099
Eldest Senior is leaving us, it feels so strange to me.

249
00:30:41,099 --> 00:30:43,460
We will always need one more person to play mahjong now.

250
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:46,799
Nonsense! When did we ever play?

251
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:58,340
Who knows if we'll see each other again.

252
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:03,280
As long as Wind Taker is still here,

253
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,600
we'll still be together.

254
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:25,860
We will always be the undefeatable four heroes from the Wind Taker!

255
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:35,350
♫ The dark green sea is hazy dissipating in a flash ♫

256
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:37,639
Without heroes, a country can't be stable.

257
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,039
Without generals, an army can't be powerful.

258
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:43,250
The victory goes to the runner-up

259
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:46,870
of the Pneuma Combat Convention, Xifan.

260
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,350
He is appointed as the Commander of the Agile Dragon Army.

261
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:51,190
He is granted the family name of Zhao.

262
00:31:51,199 --> 00:31:52,840
It is to show the favor of His Majesty.

263
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:57,130
Hope he can always be victorious.

264
00:31:57,139 --> 00:31:59,790
Ling Ziyan is benevolent and gentle.

265
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:02,610
She is granted as Princess Yanling.

266
00:32:02,619 --> 00:32:05,340
She will be married to Xifan soon.

267
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:09,420
Hope they can be happy together.

268
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,460
- Thank you for your grace, Your Majesty.
- Thank you for your grace, Your Majesty.

Please be at ease!

286
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,580
What are you doing?

287
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:05,099
Weren't you are afraid of dirt and hard work? Let me help you.

You are going to get dirty with me either way, what's there to be afraid of?

289
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:10,099
The Fifth Institute relies on your cooking and I still need you to clean.

290
00:34:10,099 --> 00:34:14,259
That's alright! I will help you and also clean for you for the rest of my life.

291
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,930
What are you doing?

292
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:24,220
Do you still want to eat? Get back!

293
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,740
Biased!

294
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:33,918
L-little White, don't look!

295
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:36,718
I will find you a girl bunny later on.

296
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:39,600
Punishing you with four more hours.

297
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,800
Master, I… No way, Master!

298
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,030
Look at how many disciples you've driven away already.

299
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:48,570
If the four of us also leave, you'll be all alone.

300
00:34:48,579 --> 00:34:52,459
- Exactly.
- I had fewer disciples before.

301
00:34:52,459 --> 00:34:54,660
They weren't even afraid of Soul Splitting.

302
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:57,970
It's not like you, not giving me any face.

303
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,139
Master, did you remember something?

304
00:35:01,139 --> 00:35:02,940
Do you regain your memory?

305
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:05,320
Do you remember what that disciple's name was?

306
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:12,460
- Lu… Lu…
- Lu… Lu… Lu...

307
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:17,180
They... seem…

308
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:22,520
- Lu…
- Lu…
- I don't remember anymore.

309
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,940
But they seemed to...

310
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,639
have cooked crab porridge for me?

311
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:39,359
- Yes. Yes. They did!
- They made you porridge.

312
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:42,180
- Do you remember anything else?
- Yes. You finally remembered.

313
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:44,839
Yes. Master, think again carefully.

314
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:50,659
I have tried everything but nothing's working,

315
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,040
and even got hit by her.

316
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:07,900
- Where is your master?
- He left the whole mess to me.

317
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:10,180
I want to find him even more than you do.

318
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:17,260
No need to look! I roughly know where he is.

319
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:21,559
Senior Chu Min, like this, can be good, too. She's forgotten the cruel past.

320
00:36:21,559 --> 00:36:23,780
It's not necessarily a bad thing.

321
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:27,879
No. Say it more clearly. Where is my master?

322
00:36:27,879 --> 00:36:30,759
I can't say. I can't say.

323
00:36:30,759 --> 00:36:34,639
Isn't it good if you take charge of his Seven Martyr Court?

324
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,219
Bai Li, let's have a cup of tea.

325
00:36:39,219 --> 00:36:40,440
Yes.

[Wind Taker Institute]

328
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,139
Old Guo, you have a good meal today.

329
00:37:10,139 --> 00:37:14,899
I brought you some high quality Cypress Wine. Here!

330
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,300
I want you even as a corpse. Old Guo—

331
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,910
It is improper for men and women to be so close.

332
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:47,630
Madam, please behave yourself.

333
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:49,100
Old Guo—

334
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,560
Mind your behavior!

335
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,419
All right! I heard your brother mention it before.

336
00:37:56,419 --> 00:38:00,480
You're just his stuffy, sour faced younger brother, aren't you?

337
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,150
I am Guo Wushu.

338
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:03,810
It is my first time here.

339
00:38:03,819 --> 00:38:08,540
From today onward, I plan to rebuild the Wind Taker Institute.

340
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:12,840
I know that you built my brother's tomb.

341
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,640
- Thank you very much.
- Sure, you can!

342
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:20,800
Then how about this, pay the debt your brother owes to Ruyu Restaurant on his behalf.

343
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:30,519
My brother has always had this bad habit since childhood.

344
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,460
I can't it help, either.

345
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,000
Stop right there!

346
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,960
It's just as well!

347
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:42,040
Anyway, in order to build your school in Chenqiao, you'll still need me for protection.

348
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:45,840
As for money, we can talk about it later.

349
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:50,019
Come on! Let's start with how we call each other.

350
00:38:50,019 --> 00:38:54,740
From now on, you can call me Ruyu.

351
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:04,540
Jin. Ru. Yu.

352
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,920
What a unique name!

353
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:14,439
Remember it! Ru as in a good husband.
[ Guo Youdao's Tomb ]

354
00:39:14,439 --> 00:39:17,140
Yu as in a good fortune.

355
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:25,940
Just one short year later, the Agile Dragon Army accomplished heroic victories.

356
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:30,719
Led by Zhai Rong, Shuo expanded greatly.

357
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:34,740
It united the whole land through peace and abundance.

358
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:50,259
We defeated the army of Su but it was difficult.

359
00:39:50,259 --> 00:39:54,719
Without the help from the Dark Walkers, I don't think it would've been that easy to break into the city.

360
00:39:54,719 --> 00:39:58,919
Lu Ping and Su Tang really empower the name of the Dark Walkers.

361
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,920
We're out in the open so if they want to see us, they can.

362
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:04,270
They live in secret so even if we wanted to see them, it's still difficult.

363
00:40:04,279 --> 00:40:07,440
Even without meeting, we cooperated well.

364
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,550
It's like having someone by your side who knows what's in your heart.

365
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:12,390
It is very rare.
