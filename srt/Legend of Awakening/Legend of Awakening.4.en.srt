00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:29,000
♫ The dark green sea is hazy ♫

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,860
♫ dissipating in a flash. ♫

4
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:36,640
♫ Rivers and lakes divide the world. ♫

5
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,970
♫ Ten thousands arrows are firing at once. ♫

6
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:43,910
♫ Who has time to worry? Who loves the color of blood? ♫

7
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:47,840
♫ At that time, spirits are high. ♫

8
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,610
♫ Who calls the world his home? Who dares let his horse freely run? ♫

9
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:54,300
♫ Silently, tears form in the death of night. ♫

10
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,290
♫ Heroes are cutting all ties, ♫

11
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:02,030
♫ giving up whether it's life or death, ♫

12
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:04,270
♫ never asking what the cost is. ♫

13
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:09,800
♫ Good and evil must be distinguished. ♫

14
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,670
♫ The wind blows off the snow. ♫

15
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:17,640
♫ On the body, etch multiple scars, ♫

16
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,670
♫ wandering all over the world, ♫

17
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:25,260
♫ only wish to ask for answers from this world. ♫

18
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:29,110
♫ A teenager doesn't have to be a hero. ♫

19
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:33,040
♫ There is no need for flowers in the dream. ♫

20
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,250
♫ Destiny need not be afraid. ♫

21
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:40,790
♫ Because you have him all the way, ♫

22
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:44,660
♫ experienced a handful of conquests, ♫

23
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:48,540
♫ overcame a number of challenges. ♫

24
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,680
♫ From now on, happy and free! ♫

25

♫ The only wish is, with the world, ♫

[Episode 4]

29
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:20,279
I'm just joking with you, young lady.

30
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,960
Was it fun?

31
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:43,679
Get up.

32
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,959
- Let go of my brother.
- Why should I?

33
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:53,520
I've been wanting to capture him.

34
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,018
How foolish!

35
00:03:55,018 --> 00:03:57,918
If my brother is really from the Mountain and Sea Gang, would he avoid Xing Luo?

36
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:00,800
Would he risk his life to save you?

37
00:04:01,859 --> 00:04:05,960
I guess that he saved me so he can use me to get near to Uncle Wen.

38
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,999
If he's not related to the Mountain and Sea Gang, how does he know Xing Luo so well?

39
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:13,840
That day at the fort, why do you want to snatch the Mountain and Sea Badge?

40
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:20,100
So, you're not talking? After I escort you back, I have a hundred ways to make you talk.

41
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,980
Can you be reasonable?

42
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:25,319
Su Tang, this place isn't safe.

43
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:27,810
Go back to the Wind Taker Institute.

44
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:33,270
Furthermore, Miss Qin wants to invite me to her house.

45
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:36,079
Her family is famous and highly respected.

46
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:38,159
She'll keep me safe.

47
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,360
Let's go!

48
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,099
Act according to the situation.

49
00:04:49,179 --> 00:04:51,100
Lu Ping's identity can't be exposed.

50
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,038
I must save him as soon as possible.

51
00:04:53,038 --> 00:04:56,179
[Ruyu House]

52
00:04:56,179 --> 00:04:58,249
Young Lord Wei, you can't do so.

53
00:04:58,249 --> 00:05:01,259
If you do so, Miss Qin won't agree to it.

54
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:04,049
Bring Miss Ling away and treat her well.

55
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,470
Be gentle!

56
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:07,950
Come!

57
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,699
What's happening?

58
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:13,979
Young Lord Wei, do you want me to act with you again?

59
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:18,360
This is a strategy I devised specifically for Sangsang.

60
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,958
Beauties love heroes! It's the truth for many centuries.

61
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:27,349
I employed these strong men to cause trouble here but Madam Jin, don't worry!

62
00:05:27,349 --> 00:05:31,469
I'll pay you double for all the damaged items.

63
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:38,160
I'll go prepare now, you can start it later.

64
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,879
I'll come in time to stop it.

65
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:44,978
Remember, be fierce! The fiercer you are, the better.

66
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:48,039
This way, I can show my bravery and mightiness.

67
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:52,479
Only then, Sangsang will remember me and be impressed.

68
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,259
Young Lord Wei, have a nice day!

69
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:59,379
Did you hear him? He's paying double for all the damaged items.

70
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,639
Miss Qin.

71
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,459
Young Miss Qin.

72
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:12,858
Wen Gecheng is indeed my third maternal uncle's grandpa's brother.

73
00:06:12,858 --> 00:06:14,359
I'm alone now.

74
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,959
I want to go to him for shelter, but I can't reach him.

75
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:20,219
I could only find you.

76
00:06:20,219 --> 00:06:22,719
I can't do this! I can't walk anymore.

77
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:27,559
Don't put on an act! If you don't walk, I'll break your legs.

78
00:06:27,559 --> 00:06:31,699
If you do so, you'll have to carry me then.

79
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,219
I'm not being unreasonable.

80
00:06:38,219 --> 00:06:40,920
I captured you because of the case.

81
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,120
Why does Mountain and Sea Gang want to kill you?

82
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,659
If you can tell me the truth or if you have any difficulties,

83
00:06:47,659 --> 00:06:50,240
the Qins will protect you.

84
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,419
My life is in your hands.

85
00:06:52,419 --> 00:06:56,080
Can I not tell you the truth? Miss Qin, please take pity on me!

86
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,559
Tell me where Wen Gecheng is living, I swear I won't bother you again.

87
00:07:00,559 --> 00:07:03,079
I'll kowtow to you 18 times.
(TN: kowtow is to kneel in submission/respect)

88
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:04,700
All right?

89
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,659
Uncle Wen was chased by his enemies back then.

90
00:07:09,659 --> 00:07:12,819
When my brother saved him, he said this before.

91
00:07:12,819 --> 00:07:16,059
He's alone without relatives and friends.

92
00:07:16,059 --> 00:07:20,158
So during this term's Pneuma Combat Convention, my brother strongly recommended him as the examiner.

93
00:07:20,158 --> 00:07:24,759
Make sure that there's no fraud to silence everyone in the court.

94
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:27,279
How could you be his relative?

95
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:30,519
What you're saying is...

96
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,240
I can see him in the Pneuma Combat Convention.

97
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,220
Cut the crap! You must come with me today.

98
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,360
I'll investigate who the heck you are.

99
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,059
If you touch my brother, I'll kill them both.

100
00:07:42,059 --> 00:07:43,959
Ziyan?

101
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:47,759
No wonder you're my God-sister! I have taught you well.

102
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,699
Sangsang, I was sneak attacked by this girl of the Wind Taker Institute.

103
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,539
Despicable! Shameless!

104
00:07:55,539 --> 00:07:59,440
Despicable? If I was, would I exchange two for one?

105
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,319
Ms. Qin, you got a better deal.

106
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,120
Let them go first!

107
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:11,938
Miss, your task is more important.

108
00:08:11,938 --> 00:08:15,538
My life belongs to the Qin family, it's not worthy of your troubles.

109
00:08:15,538 --> 00:08:17,140
Don't move!

110
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:25,179
Miss, everyone's life belongs to themselves.

111
00:08:25,179 --> 00:08:28,440
Even if you lose all your blood, you should try to live.

112
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,079
How could you give up so easily?

113
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,499
Wasps!

114
00:08:43,499 --> 00:08:45,319
Don't bite me!

115
00:08:45,319 --> 00:08:47,379
Help!

116
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:55,739
Ziyan, save him!

117
00:09:00,739 --> 00:09:05,359
Miss Qin, I'll see you when I see you.

118
00:09:05,359 --> 00:09:07,879
Don't fall into my hands again!

119
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:11,339
Silly girl!

120
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:14,019
Miss Qin, Miss Qin.

121
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,039
Where is she?

122
00:09:18,119 --> 00:09:20,618
Zhao Xifan, Lu Ping is the God of Bandits.

123
00:09:20,618 --> 00:09:22,379
Ms. Qin knows about it.

124
00:09:22,379 --> 00:09:24,499
She should be waiting for me here.

125
00:09:24,499 --> 00:09:27,659
She must be nearby and definitely can testify for me.

126
00:09:27,659 --> 00:09:30,278
Enough! Don't defame a disciple of Wind Taker Institute.

127
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:32,650
Let's go to the officials.

128
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,210
Could it be Lu Ping?

129
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:37,699
Today, I came here to capture a person.

130
00:09:37,699 --> 00:09:39,819
But this place has someone highly skilled sheltering them.

131
00:09:39,819 --> 00:09:44,618
Since that someone is so kind, he won't stand idly by.

132
00:09:44,618 --> 00:09:46,449
Sorry for putting you guys through this.

133
00:09:46,449 --> 00:09:50,879
Let's see how many lives are lost before he shows up.

134
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,120
Where are you, Young Lord Wei?

135
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,290
Young Lord Zhao, come here and help me!

136
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:32,550
Zhao Xifan, do you know them?

137
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:37,379
My silver sickle remembers you.

138
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,260
Go, go! Let's go!

139
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,130
Jump!

140
00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:11,319
Sure enough, an arrow can kill.

141
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:56,399
You can't even hold a blade! You're still as useless as before.

142
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:02,110
Take her.

143
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,800
Zhao Xifan, are you all right?

144
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:17,540
Brother, about your conversation with Miss Qin, I already heard it.

145
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:21,019
Xing Luo already reached Chenqiao Town, Wind Taker Institute isn't safe anymore.

146
00:12:21,019 --> 00:12:24,500
Maybe the Qins is a safe path.

147
00:12:25,139 --> 00:12:26,879
Brother

148
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:32,978
The Qins can't win against the Mountain and Sea Gang; nobody can win against that Gang.

149
00:12:32,978 --> 00:12:36,500
If Miss Qin wants to die, it's up to her.

150
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,160
Anyway, we won't be captured again.

151
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,719
Zhao Xifan! Wait for me!

152
00:12:43,719 --> 00:12:46,899
You're heavily injured, you'll bleed to death.

153
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:49,379
About Lu Ping, you haven't figured it out yet.

154
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:52,958
- You're not angry at him but I still need him for the reward—
- Shut up!

155
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:56,899
Even if Lu Ping's background is unclear, he's still from the Wind Taker Institute.

156
00:12:56,899 --> 00:13:00,430
You're just an outsider, leave the Wind Taker Institute!

157
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:05,760
Zhao Xifan, did you forget you were beaten into a pulp in Ruyu House?

158
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,599
This Young Grandpa is your savior.
(TN: Chinese usually nicknames him/herself in a sarcasm, a joke, or to a friend.)

Scram! Get lost now!

I won't get lost! I'm leaving.

161
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:32,019
We can't stay long at the Wind Taker Institute.

162
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:38,100
Before the Mountain and Sea Gang finds us, we must leave first.

163
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,459
Leave? Where to?

164
00:13:40,459 --> 00:13:42,420
Pneuma Combat Convention.

165
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:46,220
But I need to pass the Chan State's exam to qualify for the competition.

166
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:49,938
Didn't Master say that for this year's Pneuma Combat Convention,

167
00:13:49,938 --> 00:13:52,100
the court will choose the contestants?

168
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,639
Brother, do you want to be an official?

169
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:57,739
So during this time's Pneuma Combat Convention, Qin Qi strongly recommended him as the examiner

170
00:13:57,739 --> 00:14:02,919
to make sure that there's no fraud to silence everyone in the court.

171
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:05,870
Right now, the Qin's are keeping their eyes on Wen Gecheng.

172
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,980
The Qin family is rich and influential.

173
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:11,439
They won't simply accept people with an unknown background like us.

174
00:14:11,439 --> 00:14:14,279
Since Wen Gecheng is the examiner of the Pneuma Combat Convention,

175
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:16,980
then that is our best chance to meet him.

176
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,919

Father, Sangsang wants to leave.

189
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:15,460
Is it because I was kidnapped by those two wild men? It's so embarrassing.

Don't you want to stay for two more days?

193
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,990
Ziyan, have you thought about

00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:36,840
why Xing Luo came to Ruyu House?

195
00:15:38,379 --> 00:15:40,570
Although we lost the lead on Xing Luo,

196
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:43,570
that bandit from the Mountain and Sea Gang is right.

Our whereabouts are exposed.

198
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,639
Wei Tianqi rescued me before.

199
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:53,300
However, when Wei family knows that we're investigating the Mountain and Sea Gang, they want to take credit for our work.

200
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,900
Acting on their own accord is possible, too.

201
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,859
Anyway, we should be careful.

202
00:16:02,659 --> 00:16:07,579
Although that young lord looks like a rogue, he actually has a kind heart.

203
00:16:07,579 --> 00:16:10,040
Miss, you still refuse to let him go.

204
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:15,200
I have a premonition that as long as we can capture him,

205
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,279
we'll be one step closer to the truth of the Mountain and Sea Gang.

206
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,339
Also, he's not a Young Lord!

207

Suspicious whereabouts, despicable and nasty, he's indeed, a hooligan!

208
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:33,040
In the future, without my permission, you're not allowed to die.

I'm not so useless to have someone sacrificing for me.

How touching! One death isn't enough, he even found a companion.

318
00:24:58,399 --> 00:25:00,440
Cut the crap!

319
00:25:19,419 --> 00:25:21,259
- God of Bandits!
- God of Bandits!

320
00:25:21,259 --> 00:25:22,679
God of Bandits came to save us.

321
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,160
God of Bandits is here to save us.

322
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,299
Eldest Senior, how are you?

323
00:25:31,299 --> 00:25:33,459
Save the others first!

324
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:38,278
I've suffered so much but you only came now.

325
00:25:52,479 --> 00:25:54,779
Come! Let's go.

326
00:25:54,779 --> 00:25:57,118
Leave now. Leave!

327
00:25:58,899 --> 00:26:00,399
Mo Lin!

328
00:26:00,399 --> 00:26:02,740
I killed a guy after all.

329
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:06,540
I don't believe that I can't kill a lady.

330
00:26:25,659 --> 00:26:30,179
Mo Lin, Master hid a Flame Knife.

331
00:26:30,179 --> 00:26:33,219
Use your Pneuma of Pivot to see where it was hidden.

332
00:26:39,699 --> 00:26:42,080
It's below that calabash.

333
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:48,840
Su Tang, we're counting on you.

334
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,199
Fire Stone! With Su Tang's Pneuma of Strength,

335
00:26:59,199 --> 00:27:02,599
I hope we can ignite the Flame Knife and stop Xing Luo.

336
00:27:35,179 --> 00:27:36,980
Lu Ping.

337
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,179
So, it's you!

338
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:56,139
I must inform Chief.

339
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,960
Brother.

340
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:09,819
It's too late. It's too late!

341
00:28:09,819 --> 00:28:13,338
Capture Situ Luo back! She can't return to the Mountain and Sea Gang.

342
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:30,540
My hand hurts! It hurts so much.

343
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:34,939
Who's that lady? After I left, did a thief enter Wind Taker Institute?

344
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:41,219
What are you looking at?

345
00:28:42,379 --> 00:28:45,560
I told you earlier on that my martial arts is very amazing.

346
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,330
You witnessed it today.

347
00:28:47,939 --> 00:28:52,059
Wind Taker Institute surpasses Big Dippers! That day will arrive soon.

348
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:02,040
I was only gone for a few days.

349
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:05,980
You guys already almost destroyed Wind Taker Institute.

350
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,080
I'm old already!

351
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:12,259
In case I can't handle the news and something happens, can you guys bear the consequences?

352
00:29:12,259 --> 00:29:14,878
Can you? You...

353
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:19,118
Lu Ping, it's definitely you! It must be your fault.

354
00:29:19,118 --> 00:29:21,659
Tidy up Wind Taker Institute's interior and exterior now.

355
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:24,700
If you can't finish, you can't rest!

356
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,399
- Go now.
- Wait!

357
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,260
He can't leave.

358
00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:32,260
Who's this?

359
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:34,118
I came here to capture him, so he can't...

360
00:29:34,118 --> 00:29:36,978
- Master! This guy isn't a Wind Takers' disciple.

361
00:29:36,978 --> 00:29:38,940
Don't listen to his nonsense.

362
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:43,080
This... I'm so confused now.

363
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:47,038
Zhao Xifan, don't you know everything about Lu Ping? Tell him!

364
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:51,100
Master, it was all because of my careless action,

365
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:54,600
I provoked an enemy and implicated Wind Takers.

366
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,138
Lu Ping fought to save the others, please leave him out of this.

367
00:29:57,138 --> 00:30:01,540
I'm willing to bear the punishment alone.

368
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:05,718
Zhao Xifan, who are you actually helping?

369
00:30:05,718 --> 00:30:08,799
This guy is Mo Lin who trespassed Wind Taker Institute.

370
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:11,420
Please hand him over to Su Tang for detention.

371
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:16,299
- I—
- If he speaks nonsense again, please send him to the local authority.

372
00:30:16,299 --> 00:30:18,730
- You all—
- I beg you all!

373
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:21,570
Stop talking nonsense!

374
00:30:21,579 --> 00:30:23,340
Lu Ping!

375
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:29,178
Follow me! I have something to tell you.

376
00:30:36,379 --> 00:30:38,260
Treat the wound first!

377
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:48,060
Lu Ping, hang on!

378
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:50,979
Take care of yourself before others!

379
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:09,359
What actually happened?

380
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,879
Xifan is behaving oddly today.

381
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,580
Did he discover your identity?

382
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:36,959
We're about to part, why waste your time?

383
00:31:40,619 --> 00:31:42,340
Have you decided?

384
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:44,340
Are you really leaving?

385
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:47,640
Master,

386
00:31:48,379 --> 00:31:50,300
for these three years,

387
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:53,199
all thanks to you.

388
00:31:53,199 --> 00:31:56,519
A debt must be repaid! You don't have to thank me.

389
00:31:56,519 --> 00:31:59,619
For these three years, you used that excuse to keep me here,

390
00:31:59,619 --> 00:32:02,239
so that I can feel at ease and stay here

391
00:32:02,239 --> 00:32:05,359
and Wind Taker Institute can shelter me for a while.

392
00:32:06,179 --> 00:32:10,419
However, the chains bind me and the Mountain and Sea Gang chases me day and night.

393
00:32:10,419 --> 00:32:13,000
I can't hide here my whole life.

394
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,499
After I repay this debt, we're even.

395
00:32:16,499 --> 00:32:18,760
I want to join Chan State's exam.

396
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,620
You won't have to worry about me in the future,

397
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:26,039
because I don't want to be associated with the Wind Taker Institute.

398
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:28,859
This is for the best.

399
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:05,020
All right! I'll handle this matter.

400
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:07,160
Think about it again.

401
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,020
Master.

402
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,739
Brother, I heard everything.

403
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:29,439
How much pneuma power do you have left?

404
00:33:29,439 --> 00:33:32,078
Not only the Pneuma Combat Convention, even this Chan State's exam,

405
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:34,299
you won't be able to participate.

406
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:38,699
Brother, are you all right?

407
00:33:38,699 --> 00:33:42,419
I'm fine! Compared to my previous injury, this is nothing.

408
00:33:42,419 --> 00:33:45,599
If I train for two more days, I can make it to the exam.

409
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,038
But your injury hasn't recovered, you must treat it first.

410
00:33:50,038 --> 00:33:53,119
If worse comes to worst, I'll fight for you in the exam.

411
00:33:56,039 --> 00:34:00,040
Su Tang, this is my personal matter after all.

412
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,939
Nobody can replace me.

413
00:34:01,939 --> 00:34:06,699
But you waited so long and you finally have a great chance, I should help you!

414
00:34:10,869 --> 00:34:15,239
My dear Little Sister, everything comes from my own decisions.

415
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:19,599
Take it as the last deed I'll do for the Wind Taker Institute.

416
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:26,159
Now, I want to focus on cultivation; I'll try to cultivate as much pneumatic power as possible.

417
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:30,220
Not to mention, I'm the Awakener with the unity of six pneumas.

418
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:34,339
Don't you believe that I can pass a simple Chan State's exam?

419
00:34:34,339 --> 00:34:37,118
- But you're now—
- That's enough!

420
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:38,778
I know what you want to say.

421
00:34:38,778 --> 00:34:41,099
You want to help, don't you?

422
00:34:41,099 --> 00:34:42,880
I have an idea.

423
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:48,588
How about you help me save my energy and carry me to the back of the mountain for practice?

424
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:52,000
It's there.

425
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,139
Come on up!

426
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,878
Why are you so dumb, Little Miss? I still want to save face.

427
00:35:03,878 --> 00:35:06,389
How can I let a young lady carry me?

428
00:35:06,389 --> 00:35:08,580
You fooled me!

429
00:35:09,819 --> 00:35:11,879
Wait for me!

430
00:35:11,879 --> 00:35:14,039
Brother, wait for me!

431
00:35:14,039 --> 00:35:16,878
Wearing the badge of the eldest disciple means

432
00:35:16,878 --> 00:35:22,518
that the entire Wind Taker Institute, including me, your mentor, look to you for our future.

433
00:35:23,919 --> 00:35:27,968
Zhao Xifan, do you plan to let go of Lu Ping like this?

434
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:31,340
Otherwise, what can I do?

435
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:35,338
He's so capable; yet, he's willing to be treated like trash here. Something is wrong!

436
00:35:35,338 --> 00:35:37,099
Moreover, he played you like a fool.

437
00:35:37,099 --> 00:35:39,239
Don't you want the truth?

438
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:45,080
In the end, he saved Wind Taker Institute.

439
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,959
- I don't have the right to know.
- If you won't, I will.

440
00:35:47,959 --> 00:35:52,098
I won't be taken advantage of! Even if it's bad luck, I'll get to the bottom of it.

441
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:56,500
Are you leaving without paying for meal expenses?

442
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,539
Give me your money!

443
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,519
Let go of me! Just because I don't have the Pneuma of Strength, you guys bully me.

444
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:10,159
- Release me!
- Don't be noisy!

445
00:36:13,109 --> 00:36:17,739
Master, when you brought me back to Wind Takers,

446
00:36:17,739 --> 00:36:19,808
you told me to take care of Wind Taker Institute.

447
00:36:19,809 --> 00:36:23,819
I made the wrong judgment and underestimated Lu Ping.

448
00:36:24,819 --> 00:36:27,169
The eldest disciple title

449
00:36:27,169 --> 00:36:29,679
should be given to someone who is more qualified.

450
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,658
Everything that has a beginning, has an ending.

451
00:36:35,658 --> 00:36:40,378
Even if you want to pass this position to him, you must get to the bottom of it.

452
00:36:40,378 --> 00:36:44,379
Don't be like me! I accepted him carelessly.

453
00:36:44,379 --> 00:36:48,929
You're supposed to be stronger than me.

454
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,480
Go to the back of the mountain.

455
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,100
Yes.

456
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:05,019
Wait for me! After I have the Pneuma of Strength, I'll make you guys die 800 times.

457
00:37:05,019 --> 00:37:07,940
- Quiet!
- Release me!

458
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:13,238
- Let me go!
- I can see that you're quite talented.

459
00:37:13,238 --> 00:37:16,828
Do you have a master? Do you want to join Wind Takers, this big family?

460
00:37:16,828 --> 00:37:20,259
I can give you a 20 percent discount.

461
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,480
What happened to him?

462
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,439
Brother's pneumatic power has always been unstable.

463
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:05,578
So when he's the God of Bandits, he can only make a move every half a month.

464
00:38:05,578 --> 00:38:07,420
If it wasn't to save all of you,

465
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:11,060
- he's supposed to restore his pneumatic power to join the exam.
- Su Tang!

466
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,980
Don't waste time talking to him!

467
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:18,559
Lu Ping, you were hurt because you saved the other disciples.

468
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:20,600
Everyone is worried about you.

469
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,840
I never thought of saving them.

470
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,279
I fought because Xing Luo threatened my safety.

471
00:38:30,279 --> 00:38:34,250
Eldest Senior, don't judge me by your standards.

472
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:36,900
We're different.

473
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,679
Lu Ping,

474
00:38:39,389 --> 00:38:41,560

475
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:47,059
You want to be a hero who seeks justice for the weak.

476
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:50,200
I'm not as noble.

477

Brother, are you upset?

Not really! Happiness is written all over my face.

482
00:39:17,538 --> 00:39:20,918
I do know! When Xing Luo tortured you,

00:39:20,918 --> 00:39:24,099
the more they want you to cry, the more you laugh.

I didn't do anything worth of thanking me for.

You ended up like this because you wanted to save everyone.

I don't believe you'll use up all your pneumatic power to fight against Xing Luo.

Actually, you're not as selfish as you sound.
