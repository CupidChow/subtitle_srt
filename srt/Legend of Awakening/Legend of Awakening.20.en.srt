00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,870
♫ The dark green sea is hazy ♫

3
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:32,760
♫ dissipating in a flash. ♫

4
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:36,630
♫ Rivers and lakes divide the world. ♫

5
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,980
♫ Ten thousands arrows are firing at once. ♫

6
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:43,980
♫ Who has time to worry? Who loves the color of blood? ♫

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,770
♫ At that time, spirits are high. ♫

8
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:51,610
♫ Who calls the world his home? Who dares let his horse freely run? ♫

9
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:54,280
♫ Silently, tears form in the death of night. ♫

10
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,210
♫ Heroes are cutting all ties, ♫

11
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:02,050
♫ giving up whether it's life or death, ♫

12
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:05,220
♫ never asking what the cost is. ♫

13
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:09,840
♫ Good and evil must be distinguished. ♫

14
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,760
♫ The wind blows off the snow. ♫

15

♫ On the body, etch multiple scars, ♫

16
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,780
♫ wandering all over the world, ♫

17
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:25,190
♫ only wish to ask for answers from this world. ♫

18

♫ There is no need for flowers in the dream. ♫

[Episode 20]

29
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:27,339
Master Chu Min, have you seen Qin Sang?

30
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,520
I am sleeping. Stop shouting!

31
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,020
Hurry and go back to practice.

32
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,260
Qin Sang doesn't know anyone else here in the mountains.

33
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,460
She must've come here.

34
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,360
Open the door! I have something to tell her.

35
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,400
Why would I lie to you?

36
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,160
I am leaving then.

37
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,759
Seriously? He really left?

38
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,860
In a little while, he will be far away.

39
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,820
It's going to get lively in here now.

40
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,160
Qin Sang.

41
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,560
You lied to me again.

42
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,100
Don't hit me!

43
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,540
I don't have any of the pneumatic powers.

44
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,720
I don't stand a chance fighting against you.

45
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,780
When I was by myself,

46
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,460
I missed my Eldest Senior,

47
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,020
Su Tang, and the little assassin.

48
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,740
However, the one person I missed the most

49
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,420
was you.

50
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,800
Seeing you again

51
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,580
is so good.

52
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,780
I even thought you were dead.

53
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:19,740
It must've been hard for you to rush all the way here.

54
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:23,979
I rode for so many days, my bottom hurts.

55
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,440
Why were you so careless, Miss Qin?

56
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:44,640
Lu Ping, what exactly did you go through these days?

57
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,860
Let me take you to a place.

58
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,940
I have a lot of things

59
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,620
to tell you gradually.

[Big Dipper Astronomical Observatory]

61
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,660
So... Ling Ziyan accompanied you this whole way.

62
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,980
Why did you focus only on this?

63
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,900
Are you actually jealous?

64
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,600
Only a ghost would be jealous.

65
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,840
I'm angry.

66
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,439
You're always on your own and do as you like.

67
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,140
You never tell me anything.

68
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,060
- Do you consider me as—
- As a what?

69
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,640
As a friend.

70
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,940
All I wanted before was to get revenge.

71
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,760
I didn't care about my life.

72
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,700
Nor did I want to bother others.

73
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,760
It really is magnificent here!

74
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,400
Compared to this, our so-called troubles

75
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,600
become small and insignificant.

76
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,480
Look over there!

77
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,300
That's my master's star of destiny on top of the dome.

78
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:11,640
Before he died, he tried his best to settle everything for me.

79
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:16,640
I believe that the careful arrangements he made were for a reason.

80
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,520
I will take the chance.

81
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,820
Maybe what I've been searching for

82
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,380
is at the end of this road.

83
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,720
Lu Ping.

84
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,680
No matter what you want to do, I will accompany you.

85
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,160
Just like no matter how dark the night is, with stars and someone beside you,

86
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,520
the road will always be easier to walk.

87
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,600
Qin Sang,

88
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,200
thank you.

89
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,260
Stop pretending!

90
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:57,900
Now that Eldest Senior has left the Mountain and Sea Gang, and found out some information.

91
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,239
I have to practice harder to get my pneumatic powers back

92
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,660
so we can fight the Mountain and Sea Gang together.

93
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,200
Yes! You should start practicing harder.

94
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:15,559
During the days I thought you were dead, I turn anger into strength and I can use three Pneumas now.

95
00:07:15,559 --> 00:07:19,120
- Why are you wishing for my death?
- So what?

96
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,500
- Hit me then.
- Don't think that I won't!

97
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,840
Master Chu Min, I…

98
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,660
Think about it carefully! Do you actually like Lu Ping,

99
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:59,360
or are you just trying to compete with Qin Sang?

100
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,500
I…

101
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,960
You don't really understand Lu Ping.

102
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,239
I'm still not as good as Miss.

103
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,640
If you want people to respect you,

104
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,900
you have to be strong first.

105
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,380
Master Chu Min,

106
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,860
I lost face today.

107
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,520
I'll be too embarrassed to face Lu Ping in the future.

108
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,720
Could you take me in?

109
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,549
Poor kid!

110
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:47,060
When have you not relied on Yaoguang Peak?

111
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,999
Having someone to keep me company and to talk with is also good.

112
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,360
You can stay as long as you want.

113
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,620
Thanks, Master Chu Min.

114
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,880
Why do you always use me as a shield?

115
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,140
You just said you wanted to accompany me.

116
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,500
Why are you going back on your word already?

117
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,420
My brother is a tough man.

118
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,500
Ziyan is a sensitive girl.

119
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,400
Qin Sang,

120
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,660
I regard Ling Ziyan as a friend.

121
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:25,820
It's good for her to make some things clear.

122
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:31,280
I believe that she can find her own way

123
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:35,620
and the man she can rely on.

124
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,740
Then what should we do next?

125
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,500
I hear a tune every night.

126
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,140
I think it's probably a message Master left for me.

127
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,040
But I still haven't figured out what it means.

128
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,520
If you find out where it's coming from, then wouldn't you have figured it out?

129
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,260
Big Dipper is too big.

130
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:11,000
I still haven't found where it's coming from.

131
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,820
The seniors from the Fifth Institute probably have no interest in discussing this with me.

132
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:19,760
Whether or not others listen to you, depends on what methods you use.

133
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,540
- Little White! Give Little White back to me.
- Give it back!

134
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:30,100
Why would Lu Ping hear some mysterious sounds in Big Dipper?

135
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,300
- Are you going to say it or not?
- Say it or not?

136
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,220
Give me the rabbit back first.

137
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,520
- Tell me the answer first.
- Answer.

138
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,319
Put down your sword first.

139
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,200
Tell me first and I'll put it down.

140
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,180
Quiet down, all of you!

141
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,839
Senior, Little White.

142
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:51,340
Senior Huo Ying, you don't like Lu Ping, either, do you?

143
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:54,459
- We just won't tell him. Just so mad at him—
- Stop talking.

144
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,780
I don't know what tune Lu Ping heard.

145
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:01,420
But it seems to be in the direction of Seven Martyrs Court.

146
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:04,560
All of Big Dipper's magic weapons from the past hundred years are all in there.

147
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,439
The sound you're hearing probably resonates with the weapons inside.

148
00:11:07,439 --> 00:11:09,140
An armory?

149
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,839
Let's go and have a look then.

150
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:14,320
- How could it be that easy?
- Stop talking.

151
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,420
After former masters of the Big Dipper died,

152
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:19,060
their weapons are stored in Seven Martyrs Court.

153
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:22,399
If a disciple has courage, he can challenge the Seven Martyrs Court,

154
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,520
and inherit the weapons of the elders.

155
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:28,940
If you can or can't get them, it all depends on your abilities.

156
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,900
Seven Martyrs Court is in Kaiyang Peak?

157
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:34,120
Yes. After Kaiyang Peak Master Guo Wushu started guarding it,

158
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,600
the hidden weapons inside have become even more abnormal.

159
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,080
If you are a little careless, you can lose your life.

160
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,300
Our Eldest Senior failed the challenge several times.

161
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,000
Last time he was seriously injured and went home to tend to his injuries.

162
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,120
Lu Ping, with your present skills, you aren't any better than him.

163
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,820
Senior has already said that it is not an easy thing.

164
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:56,080
How can we be compared with each other easily?

165
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,320
Little White. Little White.

166
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,880
How do I know if I can get it or not, unless I try?

167
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:12,500
Senior Huo Ying, maybe he really can succeed.

168
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:17,559
He is the only one who can compare with you in terms of how long you've practiced at Fifth Institute.

169
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:21,760
If he can succeed and walk out of the Fifth Institute, maybe you can as well.

170
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,919
If you hadn't violated the ancestral system and fought against corrupt officials,

171
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,340
you would have been in the First Institute of elites.

172
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:31,280
Don't mention that! It's all in the past now.

173
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,100
We'll have to see if he can succeed first.

174
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:37,180
- Eldest... Eldest Senior.
- What's wrong?

175
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:39,960
- Eldest Senior...
- What happened?

176
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,460
Eldest Senior went to Seven Martyrs Court again?

177
00:12:55,340 --> 00:13:00,120
What Master had tried so hard to get was in here.

178
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,539
You have only one Pneuma right now, let me go with you.

179
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:11,360
Are you worried about Master or me?

180
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,980
She just doesn't want you to die in vain.

181
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,640
Seven Martyrs Court was originally set to test the disciples.

182
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,200
The hidden traps outside are already extremely difficult.

183
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,140
You definitely can't get in with your one Pneuma.

184
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:35,500
The weapons on the Jiebing Platform are all of the highest level.

185
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,020
The mechanisms will only get more dangerous.

186
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,060
Thank you, Senior, for your reminder.

187
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:44,070
But there are some things that I have to do even if it costs me my life.

188
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:48,760
Master sent me to the Big Dipper, not for me to die.

189
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,910
I need to follow the rules to win respect from others.

190
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,260
Otherwise, I'll be looked down all my life.

191
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,900
You're practicing the Pneuma of Sound?

192
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,980
There's only that one.

193
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,440
I happen to be heading to Seven Martyrs Court, too.

194
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,700
Why don't we go together?

195
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,440
Who are you?

196
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,940
It's good to have someone leading the way.

197
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:27,520
Qin Sang, wait for me to come back.

198
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:36,330
[Seven Martyrs Court]

199
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:04,040
Master, someone is trying to get into Seven Martyrs Court.

200
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,120
I knew already.

201
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,520
They're already at the Jiebing Platform.

202
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,440
The Linked Camp Horn.

203
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,740
The weapon of Leng Xiutan, the previous master of the Big Dipper.

204
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,840
That should be what you're looking for.

205
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,060
Hold on!

206
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,040
As expected, it's Guo Wushu's place.

207
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,180
It's just like him.

208
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,020
Why are you so familiar with it?

209
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,200
The first time I was here, I was stabbed in the left shoulder by a concealed weapon.

210
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,720
The second time, I was stranded in the trap for three whole days.

211
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:15,160
The third time, I was hit by my own Pneuma of Strength rebound.

212
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,320
There's 100 more times after that.

213
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,640
Do you want to hear them all?

214
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,660
Our Eldest Senior failed the challenge several times.

215
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:25,410
Last time he was seriously injured and had to go back home to tend to his injuries.

216
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:29,180
You may not be better than him with your present skill.

217
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:33,320
So you are the Eldest Senior of the Fifth Institute.

218
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,399
Try to resonate with it by using Pneuma of Sound.

219
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:42,000
Find the direction of the sound wave, only then you can get the weapon.

220
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,560
Are you okay?

221
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,140
Someone is coming, I have to go now.

222
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,760
Sangsang, why are you here?

223
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:06,980
I initially thought Guo Youdao had taught you something remarkable,

224
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,580
but you only learned to be arrogant and conceited.

225
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:12,220
That year, I promised him I would stay at the Seven Martyrs Court.

226
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:15,100
Did you think I was wasting all those years?

227
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:18,960
The Linked Camp Horn is the most powerful weapon in the Big Dipper.

228
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,300
Am I right?

229
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,379
Lu Ping, don't even think about it.

230
00:18:24,379 --> 00:18:28,639
You can't even pass my master's ordinary defenses but you want the Linked Camp Horn?

231
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:32,239
No wonder my master always wanted me to come here.

232
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,320
Before, at the Pneuma Combat Convention, I was able to take first place.

233
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:41,720
Now that I'm here at the Big Dipper, I will also win here.

234
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,920
So arrogant!

235
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:48,480
The defense of Seven Martyrs Court is my life's work.

236
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,759
I made the Jiebing Platform of the Linked Camp Horn using the special characteristics of the Pneuma of Sound.

237
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:56,140
It's hard for ordinary people to get close.

238
00:18:56,140 --> 00:19:00,800
If you can get the Linked Camp Horn,

239
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,820
I would admit defeat completely.

240
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:08,200
I would then do my best to help you in Big Dipper with any request you make.

241
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,120
It's a deal, then.

242
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:18,200
Qin Sang, let's go.

243
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,900
I really want to see

244
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:34,740
the strength of Guo Youdao's disciple.

245
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:54,440
Stop looking, stop looking! Let's continue playing mahjong. Eight rounds today.

246
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,540
Whoever loses will cook and wash dishes.

247
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:01,160
Why are all people in the Fifth Institute so lazy?

248
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:05,220
In their despair, I was the little hope they had.

249
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,860
I'm the one who let them down.

250
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,500
- Lu Ping.
- It's okay.

251
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,060
You can go back to Master Chu Min to rest.

252
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:19,620
I'm going to think about what to do.

253
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,680
One Dot. (TN: A Mahjong tile)

254
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,360
Keeping playing, keep playing.

255
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,320
You are…

256
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:57,180
The Fifth Institute, Xu Weifeng.
[Xu Weifeng - Big Dipper Fifth Institute]

257
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,240
Thanks for your help today.

258
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,939
We are from the same institute so I can't just stand there to watch you die.

259
00:21:06,939 --> 00:21:11,840
Moreover, everyone looks down on us so I don't want anyone left behind.

260
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,680
Disciples in Wind Taker, no one shall be left behind.

261
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,980
You remind me of someone.

262
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:27,020
He used to often say things like that but he is much purer in heart than you are,

263
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:30,760
in that he doesn't use others as an excuse.

264
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,680
What do you mean?

265
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:39,100
You've been there hundreds of times and never got any weapon.

266
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:42,300
It means that the weapon you are looking for is of a very high level.

267
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:46,640
You saved me to take advantage of my Pneuma of Sound to pave the way.

268
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,820
Your target is also the Linked Camp Horn.

269
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,400
What I said is correct, isn't it?

270
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:00,900
I thought you were good but I didn't expect you were also useless.

271
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,640
Same as you!

272
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,660
I don't think you're much better

273
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,760
although I am curious.

274
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,620
There are thousands of weapons in Seven Martyrs Court.

275
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,719
Why do you also want the Linked Camp Horn?

276
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,100
It's because it is the strongest.

277
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,560
You should always have a reason for taking it, right?

278
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,260
For me, it's because I want to leave the mountain to get rid of evil.

279
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:26,359
- What about you?
- Does that matter?

280
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,140
I will get the Linked Camp Horn.

281
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,980
I won't let you get to it first.

282
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:01,919
Not with the best of intentions. Say it! What do you want?

283
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,799
I want to ask you, Master Chu Ming,

284
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:08,080
is there a way to help Lu Ping get the Linked Camp Horn quickly?

285
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,320
He wants the Linked Camp Horn?!

286
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,720
Guo Youdao.

287
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:23,340
You really do have more intentions than a hive of bees.

288
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,780
Wine!

289
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,060
That's right!

290
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,980
It's this tune.

291
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,820
What is this?

292
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:52,580
Didn't you say that the wind in the stone room would urge the Linked Camp Horn

293
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:55,240
to expand the force of the Pneuma of Sound?

294
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:59,199
Master Chu Ming said you've lost your pneumatic powers so you can't fight it directly.

295
00:24:59,199 --> 00:25:01,940
You can only win by dodging.

296
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:04,660
So I arranged the copper chimes in this formation.

297
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:08,060
Later, I'll use the power of the sword to pick up the cobbles and hit the chimes.

298
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:12,060
The cobbles rebound can simulate the track of the Pneuma of Sound.

299
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:14,520
It can help you to practice.

300
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,480
You are so clever.

301
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,800
Did you come up with anything?

302
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,100
Do you remember the day we were breaking the Pneumas?

303
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,380
The song I hummed to you?

304
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:32,200
I don't remember where I heard it,

305
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,800
nor who sang it,

306
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,820
but it's stuck in my mind.

307
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,420
I know it's the song.

308
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:41,639
This has something to do with the Linked Camped Horn?

309
00:25:41,639 --> 00:25:45,380
It does! When I was close to the Linked Camp Horn that day,

310
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:50,740
the attacks that resonated with the wind were not irregular.

311
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:54,120
It's the tune of that song.

312
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,500
You mean that...

313
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:01,400
As long as you know this song, you will know the direction of the next sound wave.

314
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:06,000
As long as you can avoid the sound wave, you can walk up to the Linked Camp Horn.

315
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,320
Are you ready then?

316
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,860
Lu Ping.

317
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,920
You are a worthy opponent.

00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,960
However, this is something I have to do.

I am sorry.

You're back too late.

321

Tang Xiaomei said she has cleaned the kitchen.

322
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:38,919
If you dare cook without her permission, she will break your leg tomorrow.

323
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:07,960
Senior Huo Ying told me, this sweet cake is famous and difficult to buy.

324
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,380
You usually have to line up for half a day to get it.

325
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,560
How did you get it?

326
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:16,560
Did you use your family's token or throw a big lady of the house tantrum?

327
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,260
This isn't Kaifeng.

328
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:20,580
The token is useless.

329
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:23,560
I heard this shop is run by a husband and wife.

330
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:26,160
I coaxed the boss, telling them that

331
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,280
my husband is seriously ill,

332
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,960
he has high fever and keeps saying nonsense.

333
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,520
He really wants to eat your shop's sweet cake.

334
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,400
The boss believed me and gave me the last box.

335
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:43,680
Seeing how hard you've been practicing, consider it a reward.

336
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,439
You've been so influenced by me that

337
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,040
you don't even bat an eye when you lie now.

338

340
00:29:01,659 --> 00:29:04,719
I love the laidback life here.

341
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,460
Laidback?

342
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:10,979
There are no fancy clothes or delicious food, plus you have to practice with me.

343
00:29:10,979 --> 00:29:12,660
You don't mind?

344

I am the honor of the Qin Family.

345
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:21,700
Of course, I had to help when I see how useless you've become.

The martial arts of the Qin Family are secret.

348

Now there's Miss Qin attentively teaching me.

349
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:35,760
Such special treatment, am I already part of the family?

Good for you, Lu Ping! You dare take advantage of me.

- Young Lord Wei.

Miss Qin is practicing a secret skill with me.

357
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:21,920
Don't you always dread getting tired and having to work hard?

358
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,060
Why are you here to make things harder for you?

359
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:27,240
I was afraid you had some bad intentions towards Sangsang.

360
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,959
Sangsang, it's time to leave.

361
00:30:28,959 --> 00:30:31,480
Do you plan on spending the night here?

362
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:37,300
Qin Sang, let's practice tomorrow.

Xiaomei, has it been our fault this whole time?

367
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:20,600
We treat ourselves too much like losers.

368
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:23,380
So others treat us as losers.

369

I don't know when my courage

370

had become even smaller than Little White's.

371
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:41,440
Senior, I think Lu Ping can do it.

372
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:46,179
Although he failed last time, I have a hunch that he will definitely succeed this time.

373

- He is coming. He is coming.
- What?

However, it's not Lu Ping but Xu Weifeng.

Xu Weifeng, you stole my steps.

387
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:18,060
This is without morality. Is this a fair competition?

388

There is only one Linked Camp Horn so how could there be a fair competition?

♫ Laughing like the moon, ♫

478
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:38,360
♫ regretting the lighthouse broke in the waves, ♫

479
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:46,580
♫ I call the Milky Way that isolates us all, blue. ♫

480
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:53,190
♫ Can a moat be built on the seabed? ♫

481
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:57,600
♫ Wipe all the words on the paper boat! ♫

482
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:05,100
♫ Please let someone not remember and don't tell another! ♫

483
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:12,180
♫ Hide the reluctance between words ♫

484
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:16,790
♫ Unfortunately, I (you) are an average author ♫

485
00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:24,920
♫ No matter how you (I) describe the rest, it's unnecessary! ♫

486
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:35,240
♫ Don't describe my unfulfilled promise! ♫

487
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:44,060
♫ Don't interpret my hidden fire-smoke! ♫

488
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:53,000
♫ Don't let the paper boat in the rough wave chasing me! ♫

489
00:46:53,000 --> 00:47:01,680
♫ Don't wait until it's over to know there are you and me! ♫
