00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,950
♫ The dark green sea is hazy ♫

3
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:32,770
♫ dissipating in a flash ♫

4
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:36,600
♫ Rivers and lakes divide the world ♫

5
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,920
♫ Ten thousands arrows are firing at once ♫

6
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,010
♫ Who has time to worry? Who loves the color of blood? ♫

7
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,800
♫ At that time, spirits are high ♫

8
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,590
♫ Who calls the world his home?
Who dares let his horse freely run? ♫

9
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:54,370
♫ Silently, tears form in the death of night ♫

10
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:58,260
♫ Heroes are cutting all ties, ♫

11
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,110
♫ giving up whether it's life or death, ♫

12
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:04,170
♫ never asking what the cost is ♫

13
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:09,820
♫ Good and evil must be distinguished ♫

14
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,790
♫ The wind blows off the snow ♫

15
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:17,660
♫ On the body, etch multiple scars, ♫

16
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,670
♫ wandering all over the world, ♫

17
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:25,240
♫ only wish to ask for answers from this world ♫

18
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:29,210
♫ A teenager doesn't have to be a hero ♫

19
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:33,110
♫ There is no need for flowers in the dream ♫

20
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:35,170
♫ Destiny need not be afraid ♫

21
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:40,740
♫ Because you have him all the way, ♫

22
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,690
♫ experienced a handful of conquests, ♫

23
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:48,520
♫ overcame a number of challenges ♫

24
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,690
♫ From now on, happy and free! ♫

[Episode 41]

29
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,680
I brought you here

30
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,100
because I wanted to see you in your wedding outfit.

31
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,640
As long as I know in my heart

32
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:38,600
that you're here waiting for me, I will definitely come back.

33
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,480
Father.

34
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:13,160
You are getting married. Why are you here all by yourself?

35
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,100
I am nervous. I wanted to sit here for a bit alone.

36
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,939
Father, why don't you keep me company?

37
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:22,120
You brat.

38
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,320
Your marriage was decided in such a hurry.

39
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,860
There's still a lot of matters to take care of in the valley.

40
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:30,640
I've been out there for so long, how long has it been since I spent time with you?

41
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,300
Right? Come, come.

42
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,760
Come here. Have a seat. Sit!

43
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,800
Fine. Fine. Fine!

44
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,879
You're about to get married but you're still acting like a kid.

45
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,240
You only know how to idle around.

46
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,300
Aren't you used to it by now?

47
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:51,920
Besides, don't you think your son is dressed particularly nice and looks really handsome today?

48
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,680
You brat.

49
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,960
You're about to be married. You're an adult now.

50
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:13,360
I think that girl you chose really is pretty great.

51
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,500
You're like me. You know how to pick them.

52
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:22,399
Then form today onward, I'm entrusting the Carefree Valley to you.

53
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,299
Just in time. This year's herbs are almost ready for harvesting.

54
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:29,160
You have to pay attention to it. Understand?

55
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,379
Father, why do you have so little ambition?

56
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:32,899
I used to praise you before as a great hero.

57
00:04:32,899 --> 00:04:35,520
Great hero? Is it so easy to be a great hero?

58
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,719
A great hero... Leng Xiutang was a great hero.

59
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,320
Didn't he still die in the end?

60
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:47,340
I don't expect much from you.

61
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:50,190
All you have to do is guard Carefree Valley well

62
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:54,600
and live a safe life. Got it?!

63
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,500
Yes.

64
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,620
I know my limitations.

65
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:03,280
Compared to Lu Ping and Xifan, I may be nothing.

66
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,420
At least I've always thought so.

67
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:10,760
In this life, all I can do is follow them.

68
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:17,380
Father, you said before that when a man gets married, it means he's grown up.

69
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,500
He should learn to take responsibility for things.

70
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,780
So I have one more thing to do.

71
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,060
Wait. wait.

72
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,280
Silly kid.

73
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,040
Are you about to do something silly?

74
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,220
Father.

75
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,620
Father.

76
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:49,500
My Pneuma of Pivot has been stronger than yours for a while now.

77
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,340
Don't worry.

78
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:55,340
I will be a great hero for you.

79
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,440
I am not good at Pneuma of Pivot,

80
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,780
but I have to try.

81
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,540
What are you thinking about?

82
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,400
Why are you here?

83
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,460
The assassin and Su Tang are getting married today.

84
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:28,760
Su Tang said that you are still a Wind Taker senior.

85
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,660
You have to be there.

86
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,840
She asked me to invite you.

87
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:38,700
I thought... we wouldn't have the chance to drink together ever again.

88
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:42,340
I owe you an apology for the matter from before.

89
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:47,020
I almost killed you at Wuji Manor last time.

90
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,060
Consider us even.

91
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:54,000
Lu Ping, thank you.

92
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,700
Hey, don't worry about it.

93
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:58,760
Brothers aren't particular about these things.

94
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:02,540
I just hope you won't hide anything from me from now on.

95
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:05,540
All right. Let's have a good time tonight.

96
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:08,880
Let's drink instead of talk.

97
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,820
- What's wrong?
- It's bad.

98
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,200
Ziyan took the token Mo Lin gave me before.

99
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,380
She must've gone to find Mo Lin.

100
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,560
You're finally here.

101
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,080
Did anyone notice?

102
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,760
Don't worry.

103
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,479
They're all busy preparing my wedding.

104
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,120
No one will pay attention to the back mountain.

105
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,599
I will keep watch for you.

106
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,040
Be careful.

107
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,320
It's my fault I can't help you.

108
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:04,460
I'm not doing this because you begged me to.

109
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,520
I am willing to do it.

110
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,460
Besides, my death isn't necessarily certain.

111
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:13,820
Wait for me to get this done. I still have to head back and get married.

112
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:36,840
Young Master Mo, you have to succeed.

113
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,340
That's the only way we can all live.

114
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,120
Never mind. I will take the gamble.

115
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,020
Seeing as I'm lucky enough to be able to marry Master,

116
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,280
I'm sure I can get back safely.

117
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,340
As long as the flower blooms, then get rid of the poison, then it's done.

118
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:31,380
I can bear this pain.

119
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:17,079
Master. Master?

120
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:22,780
Where is Mo Lin? That brat. Did he go do stupid things again?

121
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:26,000
Master. Young Master Lu Ping and Young Master Xifan entered the valley just now.

122
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,460
They said… They said younger master might have hastened to bloom the Two Form Flower.

123
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:32,200
Disciples in the valley have already gone with them to the Forbidden House.

124
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,880
What? How? What?

125
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,500
Why are you still standing here?!

126
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,940
Go. Hurry, let's go!

127
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,200
Ziyan, why did you do this?

128
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,940
I know I acted on my own.

129
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,040
But at least if Mo Lin tries to bloom the Two Form Flower,

130
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,600
he has a higher chance of survival than you.

131
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,740
You asked Mo Lin to risk his life on his wedding night.

132
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,680
Did you think about Su Tang?

133
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:17,340
I said before, a hero shows up at the last moment.

134
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,700
You brat!

135
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,100
You...

136
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,620
You brat.

137
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:34,220
You did it. You got the flower to bloom.

138
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,260
Father, I have told you.

139
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:40,780
This is a piece of cake for the World's No.1 Assassin.

140
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,219
You brat. You even lied to me.

141
00:11:54,219 --> 00:11:58,699
Let me tell you. The next time you try this, see how I handle you!

142
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:05,340
Why didn't you discuss such a big matter with me? What if something happened, what would happen to Su Tang?

143
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:09,359
Ziyan put forward such an unreasonable request and you still had to join in the mess with her?

144
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:14,939
Don't be mad. Look, I haven't been poisoned to death, right?

145
00:12:14,939 --> 00:12:17,879
Besides, this time I did something right.

146
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:22,479
Boss, there's something related to Qin Sang that I can finally say now.

147
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,440
- Brat.
- Mo Lin.

148
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,500
Brat.

149
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,840
Brat, were you poisoned before?

150
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:52,180
Younger Master said it was just a little poison.

151
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,419
Master Mo, what's wrong with Mo Lin?

152
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,700
He had already succeeded.

153
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:07,700
But he was poisoned by something else and his last injury wasn't completely cured yet.

154
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:12,479
The two poisons have been added together. It's penetrated the viscera from the wound.

155
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,840
Boss,

156
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:27,240
don't feel sorry for me. I not only did this for you.

157
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:32,460
But for Qin Sang,

158
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:37,000
she asked me to keep it from you.

159
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,980
In fact, she has been poisoned by the cold toxin.

160
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:44,160
Her whole body's meridians

161
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,480
are completely out of order.

162
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,680
She is in extreme danger.

163
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,400
Boss,

164
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:59,400
I thought if the Two Form Flower could save you,

165
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,760
it could save her as well.

166
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:07,720
I could bloom this one for you and then plant another for her.

167
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:13,300
I didn't expect that I wouldn't have enough time.

168
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:24,240
Mo Lin, you can't die.

169
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:28,260
Su Tang is waiting for you to get married.

170
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:34,800
Father, I am sorry.

171
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:41,000
In this life, I've spent all the luck I had

172
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,780
being able to marry Su Tang.

173
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,240
Mo Lin. Mo Lin!

174
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,640
Mo Lin.

175
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,200
Mo Lin!

176
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:05,160
Mo Lin! Mo Lin!

177
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,260
Mo Lin!

178
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,740
Don't you want to get married?

179
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:18,080
Mo Lin! Mo Lin!

180
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,300
You sent Mo Lin to die!

181
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:25,540
It's not Xifan's fault. He wanted to bloom the Two Form Flower by himself.

182
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:28,999
I'm the one that didn't want him to do it so I went to beg Mo Lin.

183
00:16:28,999 --> 00:16:32,800
If you want to find someone to relieve your anger on, kill me then.

184
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,099
Xifan doesn't want you to die and he wants to protect Wuji Manor as well.

185
00:16:37,099 --> 00:16:40,779
He just wanted to balance loyalty and friendship. He's already suffered enough.

186
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:47,159
Mr. Lu Ping, it's bad. The Agile Dragon Army has surrounded Carefree Valley. They want to break in.

187
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:50,440
They said unless we turn you over, they won't leave.

188
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,400
Why is the Agile Dragon Army here?

189
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,140
Ziyan, did you ask them to surround the Carefree Valley?

190
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:02,240
Before I entered the valley I gave Wen Rui the order.

191
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:07,099
If I didn't come out of the valley tonight, he'll lead the troops to surround the valley.

192
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:12,309
Xifan, now that the Two Form Flower has bloomed, Lu Ping can go back to Kaifeng.

193
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,540
This is your hardship?

194
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,060
You still only want to complete the emperor's order.

195
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:24,700
The younger master of Wuji Manor...

196
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:28,620
has become a dog for the imperial court.

197
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,730
Yan Xifan,

198
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,280
you killed your brother.

199
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,239
Xifan, if we don't take Lu Ping now, there won't be any time left.

200
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,400
Get out, all of you!

201
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:55,059
This is Mo territory. If the Agile Dragon Army wants to enter,

202
00:17:55,059 --> 00:17:57,140
let's see if they're capable of it!

203
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,020
Chuangu,

204
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,640
- throw them out.
- Yes!

205
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,770
Master Mo, I…

206
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:07,180
I won't kill you two only because you were Mo Lin's brothers once.

207
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,880
All of you, get out now!

208
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,220
Get out!

209
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,180
Su Tang is still waiting for you.

210
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,640
So fragrant.

211
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:44,279
Osmanthus forest. There are more trees than the last time I saw it!

212
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,740
Master, do you know?

213
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:51,140
Assassins have a rule when working.

214
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:55,260
As long as there's someone we care about in our heart, then death won't take us.

215
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,960
Mo Lin!

216
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,920
Brother, where is Mo Lin?

217
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,280
Su Tang,

218
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,320
stop waiting.

219
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:25,840
I won't go. Mo Lin promised he would come back for me.

220
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,740
I have to wait for him.

221
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,500
Su Tang...

222
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,180
He won't be coming back.

223
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,770
Impossible.

224
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,640
He is the World's No.1 Assassin.

225
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,700
He has the best luck.

226
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:52,800
He always says, the great hero shows up at the last moment.

227
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,440
I have to wait for him to come back.

228
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,500
If I leave, he won't be able to find me.

229
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,580
I am sorry, Su Tang.

230
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,400
I am sorry.

231
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:41,060
Master, I'm entrusting Su Tang to you.

232
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,680
You're leaving?

233
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:50,540
You are right. The Power of Awakening is strong.

234
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,920
Wherever I go, there's going to be strife.

235
00:20:54,160 --> 00:21:00,080
Maybe my leaving is the best way to protect you.

236
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,440
If you leave, then what about your Pneuma Confinement?

237
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,220
Master,

238
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:13,020
I don't want much.

239
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,420
I only want to be a common man.

240
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,419
But the talent of the Power of Awakening hasn't given me the chance.

241
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:27,900
What it brings is one pair of shackles after another.

242
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,720
With my ability,

243
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:34,300
I should be able to control it better.

244
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,720
Right?

245
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,560
Sleep well.

246
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,720
Don't think about anything.

247
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,580
I will take care of

248
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,740
everything else.

249
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:22,260
Xifan, I know you hate me.

250
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:25,380
But I can't just watch you die.

251
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:34,140
You said you ordered Wen Rui to surround Carefree Valley last night.

252
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:41,240
If you were only a maid, why would Wen Rui obey your orders?

253
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:48,660
Ling Ziyan, when did you start working for His Majesty?

254
00:22:55,620 --> 00:23:01,680
I thought you were innocent and pure before and needed me to protect you.

255
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,120
But it's only now that I understand.

256
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:10,940
My methods can't compare with yours or even more so, His Majesty's.

257
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:18,319
What did His Majesty promise you? Money or the future?

258
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:20,780
That had you deliberately plotting ways you could stay by my side!

259
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:23,560
I didn't do it for the future.

260
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,300
Xifan,

261
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,140
you are the only one who treats me equally and with your whole heart.

262
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:37,980
His Majesty said if Lu Ping didn't die, you would die.

263
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:43,200
Between the two of you, I could only protect the one I care about the most.

264
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:53,780
Some things you are not hardhearted enough to do, or you can't do.

265
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,600
I will do them for you.

266
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:04,360
Whatever I've done, it's all been to help you.

267
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,560
Ling Ziyan,

268
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:11,060
I would never do anything to hurt my brothers.

269
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:16,200
If you can't even understand that, then it means I was blind before and misjudged you!

270
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:24,979
Miss Ling, what happened in the valley? Should we attack?

271
00:24:24,979 --> 00:24:28,659
General Wen, please go back to Kaifeng. Don't worry about the Carefree Valley.

272
00:24:28,659 --> 00:24:30,500
Xifan.

273
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,239
- But His Majesty's edict…
- The Force Eater matter,

274
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,440
I will report to His Majesty later.

275
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:40,140
If you step in and cause more trouble, which one of you will bear the responsibility?

276
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,560
You're on your own then.

277
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,890
You brat.

278
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:17,780
You're finally willing to stay in Carefree Valley.

279
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:24,060
It's all my fault. I shouldn't have let you bring others into Carefree Valley.

280
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:27,419
Don't worry. Starting from today,

281
00:25:27,419 --> 00:25:31,560
no outsiders will be allowed to come into the valley and bother you anymore.

282
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:36,500
I will leave a safe and peaceful Carefree Valley to you. Okay, son?

283
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,819
You'd better leave. No matter how long you stand there, it's no use.

284
00:25:43,819 --> 00:25:46,540
Master won't see you.

285
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:55,079
Mo Chuangu, no outsider is allowed in the valley. Get rid of all of them!

286
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:02,580
Master, the boy rushed into the mist forest recklessly.

287
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:05,640
He choked several times and refuses to leave.

288
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:09,300
He's... still a living person after all.

289
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:13,179
I am Yan Xifan. I'm asking to see Master Mo.

290
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,680
You dare come here?

291
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,860
Carefree Valley is a place where we live sequestered lives.

292
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:55,060
If you hadn't come, none of these tragic events would've happened.

293
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:58,360
All of these tragedies were brought by you outsiders!

294
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,320
Under the circumstances,

295
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:06,700
do you not want to let Mo Lin rest in peace?

296
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:11,260
I know. It's all because of me.

297
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:15,820
I'm here today to let you deal with me.

298
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:21,400
Before that, I want to show you something.

299
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,960
Mo Lin left a letter to Ziyan.

300
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:31,800
Yesterday's incident happened suddenly. We haven't had time to give it to you.

301
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:50,020
Father, granted, I am always lucky;

302
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:54,280
but just in case, if you're reading this letter,

303
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:58,600
then I must be dead. Don't be too upset.

304
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,200
Don't blame Senior Brother either.

305
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,220
The Mountain and Sea Gang are fierce. He and Lu Ping have their responsibilities.

306
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,980
I'm the most useless disciple in Wind Taker.

307
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:14,260
The only thing I can do is to try my best to help them.

308
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,940
I want you to sincerely praise me from the bottom of your heart,

309
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:21,760
I am indeed your son.

310
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,020
I want my friends to sincerely praise that

311
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,340
I am indeed their brother.

312
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:34,620
This time, it's my turn to protect you.

313
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,740
Your unfilial son, Mo Lin.

314
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:41,840
Foolish child. He really is a foolish child.

315
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:47,520
Mo Lin isn't a fool. He really is the World's No.1 Assassin

316
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,040
and my most responsible brother.

317
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:54,260
The chaos of the Mountain and Sea Gang endangers the world.

318
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:59,299
Master Mo, please help and develop an antidote to eliminate the Force Eaters.

319
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:11,480
In regards to the antidote, I will find a way.

320
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:16,580
Not to help you, but for my son.

321
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:22,280
As a father, I want to finish this for my son.

322
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:31,420
Do this. You go and capture some more people who've been cleansed of it.

323
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:38,140
Maybe through them, I can find a way to stop this.

324
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:45,080
My sincerest thanks to you. Master, I have another presumptuous request.

325
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,400
I want to see Lu Ping.

326
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,960
Lu Ping's long gone.

327
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,220
Did he say where he was going?

328
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:56,900
Before Lu Ping went, he left a message for you.

329
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:59,740
He said that the grudge between you two,

330
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:03,679
those three moves that day, have already been repaid.

331
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:07,860
Someone else needs to pay the rest.

332
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:11,540
This is bad. Lu Ping is going to seek revenge against His Majesty.

333
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,020
Reporting!

334
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:20,179
Master, Miss Ling is in a hurry to send a letter to Young Master Xifan.

335
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:30,080
[Letter of warning]

336
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:37,680
Oh no. I'm afraid Liu Song is going to test them on the people in Jin City.

337
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:42,820
You can't be everywhere at once, don't you still have that extraordinary father of yours?

338
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:49,219
I'm going to Jin City to help. Please help me send a message to Wuji Manor.

339
00:30:49,219 --> 00:30:53,899
Ask my father to stop Lu Ping at all costs. Please don't let him do something foolish.

340
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,120
As Master expected,

341
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:22,019
Xifan caused Carefree Valley's accident because of the master of the Windchimes Gang.

342
00:31:22,019 --> 00:31:27,180
Lu Ping has already left Carefree Valley and is headed towards Kaifeng.

343
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:30,920
The secret letters to all sects are already prepared.

344
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:35,660
As Master ordered, it clearly states that 19 years ago,

345
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:39,180
Yan Qiuci and Zhai Rong joined forces to invade Big Dipper

346
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:42,360
to assassinate Leng Xiutan.

347
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:47,940
That he detained Lu Chenfeng in Wuji Manor and killed him,

348
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:52,620
I advise all heroes to never be blinded by traitors.

349
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:56,460
Yan Qiuci will be defeated.

350
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,660
Older Brother!

351
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:09,400
It has been 19 years.

352
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:15,800
You were too soft-hearted back then.

353
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,860
You thought the best way was to stop the war.

354
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:24,940
Now I will start a blood feud,

355
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,440
let those who destroyed my home

356
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,960
repay me with their blood.

357
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:03,940
Coming next should be a good show.

358
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,679
Xifan, you came.

359
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,620
If you don't have the skills, don't push yourself.

360
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,820
Thank you, Young Master Yan, for your help.

361
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:08,240
What's the situation?

362
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:12,589
Everything is fine now. But we don't know if there will be more Force Eaters.

363
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:15,790
I'm guessing Liu Song is just testing it.

364
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:18,249
Strengthen the defense, protect the people and avoid fighting against them.

365
00:34:18,249 --> 00:34:21,079
We don't need to fight recklessly.

366
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:26,190
Send these bodies to Carefree Valley, please. Master Mo is working on potential solutions.

367
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,650
Yes.

368
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:30,970
Xifan, these Force Eaters are very strange.

369
00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:33,929
It was a sneak attack. But the moment we started fighting back, they ran.

370
00:34:33,929 --> 00:34:38,060
I chased them here to try and capture one to ask why.

371
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,680
Wait.

372
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:48,940
The defense troops received this letter a few days ago.

373
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:52,170
The general believes in Master Yan so he ignored this.

374
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:00,720
It's bad. These Force Eaters who snuck into Jin City are just disturbing our line of sight.

375
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:04,460
The real purpose of Mountain and Sea Gang is to sow discord

376
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:07,500
and ruin my father's prestige, then no one will help.

377
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:11,420
Master Yan is in danger now.

378
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:14,140
We have to get back as soon as possible. Let's go.

379
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:14,900
[Wuji Manor]

380
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,960
Tell Yan Qiuci to come out here!

381
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,069
Today, he has no choice but to give us a statement.

382
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:21,389
- That's right!
- Tell him to get out here!

383
00:35:21,389 --> 00:35:22,700
Tell him to come out here!

384
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:26,680
Hypocritical villain, what right does he have to lead the martial-arts circles?

385
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:30,059
Today we're here to get justice for Master Leng, aren't we?!

386
00:35:30,059 --> 00:35:31,519
- Aren't we? For Master Leng.
- That's right!

387
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:33,699
- Tell Yan Qiuci to come out.
- Tell him to come out!

388
00:35:33,699 --> 00:35:35,920
I am here.

389
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,300
Everyone, what is it that you want?

390
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:47,999
This letter says that 19 years ago, you colluded with Zhai Rong

391
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,939
to kill the former master of Big Dipper, Leng Xiutan. Is that true?

392
00:35:52,939 --> 00:35:56,000
- Speak out.
- Speak.

393
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,480
How do you explain this?

394
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:02,540
Since the letter is clear, why do you need to ask again?

395
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:07,119
Master Yan, this is all too shocking.

396
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:09,399
Please give us an explanation.

397
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:13,560
Even if it's true, what can you do to me?

398
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:18,540
- You-!
- For the past ten years, I have led the martial arts circles.

399
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:25,780
I mediate all disputes among sects so that you can still grow strong in this troubling time.

400
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:32,820
This was something that that great hero in Big Dipper would have never done.

401
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,319
Is there anyone here who could've done it?

402
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,720
This....

403
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:43,560
Wuji Manor has been a strategic defensive position on the border for a long time.

404
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,640
Protecting people, giving them peace, with the armies garrisoned here.

405
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:52,540
Now the Mountain and Sea Gang are colluding with the country of Dan. The border is in danger.

406
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:55,060
Who dares to stand up and

407
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:58,980
say that he can rise up to the current situation?

408
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:04,320
If there is one, I will give my position to him immediately and plead guilty with death.

409
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,520
Anyone?

410
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:19,080
Leng Xiutan's death

411
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:22,140
brought prosperity in Jianghu for more than ten years.

412
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:26,620
I don't think I need to give anyone an explanation.

413
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:32,000
Everyone here had better think more about how to deal with the Mountain and Sea Gang.

414
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,160
Master!

415
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,960
Master, there's a letter from Young Master.

416
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:45,340
Lu Ping knows the truth of the Event of the Seven Stars.

417
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:48,720
I hope you can stop him. I will be there soon.

418
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:53,419
Wait a moment, Master Yan. You can't convince us, so now you want to escape?

419
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:55,780
You—

420
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:00,380
[Wuji Manor]

421
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:03,140
Master, do you really plan to go?

422
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,960
You still don't understand?

423
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:12,560
Lu Ping is Liu Song's sharpest sword right now. He's sent out his right hand to commit an assassination.

424
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:18,640
The sects were the left hand, here to seek revenge. Liu Song planned all of this.

425
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:22,300
He's trying to stretch me thin, make it difficult on both sides.

426
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:26,620
If Shuo is in chaos, how can Jianghu be preserved?

427
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:30,439
Master, Lu Ping can use five forces now, he's quite strong.

428
00:38:30,439 --> 00:38:32,859
He won't be easy to deal with. Let me go with you.

429
00:38:32,859 --> 00:38:37,960
Don't bother. You stay with the steward and take care of Wuji Manor for me.

430
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:41,540
Don't let those mobs make trouble again.

431
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:45,499
The Yan Family's Sword has had a reputation in Jianghu for many years.

432
00:38:45,499 --> 00:38:50,839
If it doesn't get pulled out of its sheath at this time, how can it still be called the fastest sword in the world?

433
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:25,200
Yan Qiuci, I haven't come looking for you to pay your debts yet.

434
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,240
Yet you had the gall to come looking for me first?

435
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:35,419
I know others can't stop you, so I didn't waste any time and personally came.

436
00:39:35,419 --> 00:39:38,000
Xifan has already paid for your sins.

437
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,859
Be good and get out of my way; go back to repent. I won't kill you.

438
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:50,019
That year Eldest Brother used to ignore the chaos in the world, only concerning himself with his corner in Big Dipper.

439
00:39:50,019 --> 00:39:52,600
How could he be considered a hero?

440
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:58,259
After the Event of the Seven Stars, I brought the Wuji Manor to great heights and became the master of all martial arts circles.

441
00:39:58,259 --> 00:40:01,139
I did everything on my own, defending the border.

442
00:40:01,139 --> 00:40:04,200
Only because of that could the martial arts circles be as great as they are today.

443
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:09,580
Even if my eldest brother were alive today, he may not have had such achievements.

444
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:15,220
It's all worth the sacrifice that your parents made so we could have what we have now.

445
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:18,080
I have nothing to regret.

446
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:21,580
So even until today, you are still just one of Zhai Rong's dogs.

447
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:26,580
What I do now, was never because of loyalty to another.

448
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:31,660
After you go, you will only become Liu Song's sharp sword.

449
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:36,880
If I don't stop you today, the moment Zhai Rong dies, the world will be in chaos.

450
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:41,940
Then where will Jianghu, that I've been in charge of my entire life, go?

451
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:48,260
After everything you said, you still did this for your own selfish reasons and slaughtered the innocent.

452
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:51,619
Life and death are decreed by fate. You need to recognize that.

453
00:40:51,619 --> 00:40:54,910
If you must go today,

454
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:58,020
then you'll have to die in my hands.

455
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,660
Well said.

456
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:06,640
I hope that if Uncle Yan dies under my sword today, you'll learn to recognize that life and death are decreed by fate.

457
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:14,660
These words of having no regrets, you can save them for my parents and Uncle Lyu.

458
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:41,260
Kill me if you can. Leave no chance for my revival.
(T/N: lit translation is to cut out the stem and the root)

459
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:45,400
Because if I live even just one day, I won't let Zhai Rong go,

460
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:48,900
and I also won't let anyone stand in my way.

461
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:51,460
Fine. I will do as you wish.

♫ I smiled to the leaving person ♫

470
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:41,160
♫ The more spotlight, the more vivid the story ♫

471
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:46,080
♫ Laughing like the moon, ♫

472
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:50,610
♫ regretting the lighthouse broke in the waves, ♫

473
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:58,170
♫ I call the Milky Way that isolates us all, blue ♫

474
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:05,300
♫ Like a moat built under the sea, ♫

475
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:10,140
♫ waiting for the words on the paper boat to disappear, ♫

476
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:18,230
♫ there must always be someone who doesn’t
remember listening to the other ♫

477
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:24,750
♫ Anyone who is correctly guessed will end in disfavor ♫

478
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:28,950
♫ You are particularly touched but others consider it ordinary ♫

479
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:34,280
♫ Like the author, roughly put down with a weak stroke, ♫

480
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:38,670
♫ the writing boat on the lake was just like
a paper crane in the air ♫

481
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:43,500
♫ Laughing like the moon, ♫

482
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:48,270
♫ regretting the lighthouse broke in the waves, ♫

483
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:56,690
♫ I call the Milky Way that isolates us all, blue ♫

484
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:03,200
♫ Can a moat be built on the seabed? ♫

485
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:07,510
♫ Wipe all the words on the paper boat! ♫

486
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:14,850
♫ Please let someone not remember and don't tell another! ♫

487
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:22,010
♫ Hide the reluctance between words ♫

488
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:26,640
♫ Unfortunately, I (you) am (are) an average author ♫

489
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:34,190
♫ No matter how you (I) describe the rest, it's unnecessary! ♫

490
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:45,150
♫ Don't describe my unfulfilled promise! ♫

491
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:53,870
♫ Don't interpret my hidden fire-smoke! ♫

492
00:45:53,870 --> 00:46:02,910
♫ Don't let the paper boat in the rough wave chasing me! ♫

493
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:11,510
♫ Don't wait until it's over to know there are you and me! ♫
