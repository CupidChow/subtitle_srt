♫ dissipating in a flash. ♫

♫ Rivers and lakes divide the world. ♫

♫ Who has time to worry? Who loves the color of blood? ♫

♫ At that time, spirits are high. ♫

After the peace talks, Minister Xu will hold many activities to celebrate in the city.

I advise you to go and have a look.

31
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,820
I would be lonely if I go by myself.

What about if I go with Qin Sang?

33

She loves such lively activities, it'll make her happy.

Whether you want to go or not, it's as you like.

Qin Sang absolutely cannot.

in exchange for my previous contribution.

38
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,780
Fine, then! Considering the contribution you made,

39
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:59,899
- you may take her but just this one time!
- That's great! Thank you, General Qin.

By the way, I just saw Su Tang went out by herself.

She didn't look too happy.

I also thank you for him.

Does Lu Ping really care about his senior brother that much?

58
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,359
Why did he go out secretly at midnight?

Who knows what he was up to?

Young Master heard that you were always searching for Young Lord Yan.

He gave some money to the refugees

but he has his portrait.

I should have noticed that detail.

I only pity him.

In order to fulfill his own ambitions, he risked other people's lives.

No matter what, I need to stop him.

I know that, Brother.

Since he's decided to treat you badly,

no matter who he is, I also will not forgive him.

163
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,440
- Yes.
- Exactly!

164
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,180
Isn't that Young Hero Lu? Look! He's Young Hero Lu.

165
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,479
- Young Hero Lu.
- That is Young Hero Lu?

166
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,360
And there is Young Hero Yan.

167
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,320
- Yan Xifan?
- Young Hero Yan.

168
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:35,800
- Young Hero Yan?
- Young Hero Yan!

169
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,260
Why are you here?

170
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,560
Wasn't it you who told me to come?

171
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,660
- Young Hero Lu.
- That is Young Hero Lu.

172
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:43,719
- Young Hero Lu.
- Young Hero Lu.

173
00:13:43,719 --> 00:13:45,340
Thanks to you, two young heroes.

174
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,280
You saved us, you're our saviors.

175
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,400
Thanks to you.

176
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,600
You saved us.

177
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,500
That was exhausting!

178
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,360
Well, heroes, how does it feel?

179
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,600
Don't even say it.

180
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,260
I feel completely uneasy.

181
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,500
Be honest! Don't learn from Mo Lin.

182
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,180
It is all right, I guess.

183
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,760
I am pretty happy.

184
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,740
I'm here! I'm here!

185
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:15,599
Why am I late again? Someone has to praise my contribution as the No. 1 assassin.

186
00:15:15,599 --> 00:15:18,659
You didn't save those people. It is none of your business.

187
00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:22,800
Eldest Senior had said that not one person in Wind Takers would be left behind.

188
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,840
Although the convention wasn't that long ago,

189
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,360
it feels like it happened ages ago.

190
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,400
Everything is different.

191
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:43,920
Fortunately, you are still with me.

192
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,200
Congratulations, Junior!

193
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:52,680
Without the Mountain and Sea Gang, there's no more harm or darkness.

194
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,440
You are finally free.

195
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,979
We're all here. It's also time.

196
00:15:59,979 --> 00:16:01,700
What exactly do you want to do?

197
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:04,630
I had prepared for you a surprise.

198
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,290
Look at the sky!

199
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:12,120
If it's just a starry sky, that's too boring.

200
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:20,500
♫ Who is reflected in your eyes? ♫

201
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:26,270
♫ Pretending to be indifferent like a drizzle, ♫

202
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:30,400
♫ when the mirror in the bottom of the pupil has been lifted out, ♫

203
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:35,700
It's not just you who can give others surprises. Remember this feeling.

204
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:39,460
It is the happiness after helping the poor and saving people's lives.

205
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:43,640
Yes, Lu Ping. Take this and start your new life with it.

206
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:50,180
♫ It’s a lifetime of foreshadowing you. ♫

207
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:54,860
It is good to be with you.

208
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,320
- Same for me.
- Same here.

209
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:06,390
♫ No matter if the sky is clear or not ♫

210
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:12,840
♫ I will still be right here ♫

211
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,680
Minister Xia,

212
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:37,860
it is obvious that the Mountain and Sea Gang is related to the Liu's in Hedong.

213
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:41,400
His Majesty has already asked me to take Yan Jin to Kaifeng.

214
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,130
The faster we can make him confess the plans,

215
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:47,360
the earlier we can intercept Hedong's Liu Clan.

216
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,500
With many of the escaped gang criminals out there,

217
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,260
it won't be easy to escort Yan Jin back to Kaifeng.

218
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:58,620
Please leave with other people the same way from which you came.

219
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:01,740
I and Wen Rui will escort Yan Jin.

220
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,099
We will go by this small path to go around.

221
00:18:05,099 --> 00:18:06,760
It should be better.

222
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:12,559
Escorting and interrogation are really your responsibilities.

223
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,280
I don't have much to say.

224
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:19,020
However, getting back to Kaifeng quickly to report the mission complete without any mishap,

225
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,920
would be good for both of us.

226
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,059
I have something important to talk to General Qin about, what are you doing here?

227
00:18:25,059 --> 00:18:28,340
General Qin, I want to see Yan Jin.

228
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,590
No way! He is a severe criminal.

229
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:32,550
You can't just see him because you want to.

230
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,680
Lu Ping, just because you've made some contributions,

231
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,790
do you think you can ask for whatever you want now?

232
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:39,400
This is a serious matter for our kingdom.

233
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,670
You, a man from pugilist world, doesn't have the right to interfere.

234
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:47,680
General Qin, Lu Ping has been tortured by the gang for ten years.

235
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:51,799
I think he must get clarity about his past in order to move on.

236
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,320
Please forgive him.

237
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,060
Now that my father is helping you search for the escaped criminals,

238
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,780
Would you do us a favor—

239
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,650
I understand.

240
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:03,040
Wen Rui,

241
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:07,999
please arrange it, I will take Lu Ping to see Yan Jin.

242
00:19:07,999 --> 00:19:09,420
Yes.

243
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,079
General Qin,—

244
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:15,780
Minister Xia, Yan Jin hasn't eaten or said anything while in our custody.

245
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:19,840
Just let them meet! Maybe we can get some details.

246
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,190
Besides, didn't you just say that

247
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:25,200
getting clarity and finishing our mission smoothly

248
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,720
would be good for both of us?

249
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,240
You've come?

250
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:12,200
I have two questions for you.

251
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,600
First,

252
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,460
how did you kill my parents?

253
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,900
Second,... why did you imprison me?

254
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,200
The first one is easy to answer.

255
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:34,220
You've been through it so you should know it well.

256
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:37,720
The Mountain and Sea Gang's tortures that you experienced,

257
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,440
had also been used on your parents.

258
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,840
Why?

259
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:48,840
Because it was interesting.

260
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:54,140
Only the boundless Mountains and Seas Gang will be able to transform you all.

261
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:02,260
There are more ways to torture two people than one person,

262
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,580
and it would be more interesting.

263
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:08,360
The Pavilion Master of the Big Dipper, Leng Xiutan,

264
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:14,760
laid like a dog in front of me and pleaded me to free him.

265
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:19,100
Wonderful! It was just too wonderful!

266
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:32,080
The answer to the second question, I think you've already known for a long time.

267
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,760
Lu Ping, just think about it!

268
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,620
Why was the Wind Taker Institute destroyed?

269
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:42,740
Why did Guo Youdao die?

270
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:51,060
Lu Ping, I warned you early on that humans

271
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:54,820
can't withstand the power of the Awakening.

272
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:58,960
Henceforth, it will bring about disasters.

273
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,660
In order to save you, your parents died first.

274
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:06,500
Next was the Wind Takers Institute.

275
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:11,200
Who will be next?

276
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:17,620
Yan Xifan? Mo Lin?

277
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,400
Su Tang?

278
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,580
Oh yes, also Qin Sang?

279
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,820
Lu Ping.

280
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,600
Come on!

281
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,240
- Kill me.
- Lu Ping, calm down!

282
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,730
What he said may not be all true.

283
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:36,370
He purposely provoking you. Don't fall into his trap!

284
00:22:36,899 --> 00:22:40,319
Lu Ping, you won't obey your senior anymore, either?

285
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:16,080
Brother, stop making it more difficult for him.

286
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,840
- Brother…
- Don't say anything.

287
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,280
Listen to what I have to say.

288
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,820
Lu Ping, I have heard about your past.

289
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:35,420
Anyone would have been angry in that situation.

290
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,620
Don't take it too much to heart.

291
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,790
I was too impulsive just now.

292
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:44,040
I almost caused trouble for you.

293
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:49,880
However, you have to promise me that he will definitely be punished.

294
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:53,300
Back then, I didn't even want to let you go before.

295
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,320
Do you think I'd let him off easy now?

296
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:02,340
I don't know why

297
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:07,060
but when I think about those things back then, I feel uneasy.

298
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:09,600
Considering your current situation,

299
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,600
wouldn't it be better to find a different place

300
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,920
to do something meaningful?

301
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,560
Gradually, you'll start to forget it.

302
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,680
I have already written to the Big Dipper

303
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,440
to ask for a room for Su Tang and Mo Lin in the Fifth Institute.

304
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:27,220
Wind Taker isn't around anymore.

305
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,120
I have to give them a new home.

306
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,920
You haven't thought of going somewhere new?

307
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:36,240
For example, Kaifeng.

308
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,250
General, don't you

309
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:46,680
think too highly of me now?

310
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,370
At the Pneuma Combat Convention in Kaifeng,

311
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:52,200
you were just a boy acting on impulse.

312
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,820
No matter how skillfull you are, I still wouldn't have chosen you.

313
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:58,360
But the you now,

314
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:01,420
you have met my standards.

315
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:06,340
You probably aware that many martial arts people who say they fight for justice their whole lives,

316
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:10,739
but all they're doing in the pugilist world is fighting and killing.

317
00:25:10,739 --> 00:25:14,320
But when you are in court, you will find that

318
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,820
your skills can be even more useful and in a better way.

319
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,710
I just want...

320
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:22,580
to be an ordinary man.

321
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,580
Things relating to official circles...

322
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:28,360
I really can't deal with.

323
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,180
Don't rush!

324
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,940
I won't force you.

325
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,820
Once you've decided, then come to find me in Kaifeng.

326
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:40,080
Also, Sang'er is going back to Kaifeng with me.

327
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,900
She has been away from home for too long, so it's also time for her to go home and curb herself.

328
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:48,319
- Brother, I…
- Are you still negotiating?

329
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,840
Just listen to your brother!

330
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,820
Interesting!

331
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:13,840
Right now, both the Agile Dragon Army and the Big Dipper are fighting over me.

332
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:21,020
Old Guo, your disciple has finally

333
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:23,320
made some achievements.

334
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,280
Boss,

335
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:31,250
there's a letter from Master Chu Min.

336
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:34,120
She asked you to go straight back to the Big Dipper after you're done.

337
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:38,100
Don't think that just because you've been a hero once, you can forget your master.

338
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,590
Brother, is the Big Dipper good?

339
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:44,940
- Is it like the Wind Takers?
- It is beautiful.

340
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:48,640
There is also a man who looks just like our master.

341
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,020
You'll surely be surprised when you meet him.

342
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:55,140
I will take you there early tomorrow morning.

343
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,020
Father.

344
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:09,119
Xifan, have you recovered from your injury?

345
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:10,720
I am fine now.

346
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:15,299
Father, didn't you say that you were going to search for the escaped criminals?

347
00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:17,700
Why are you suddenly back?

348
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:21,280
Xifan, have you seen the chief leader of the Mountain and Sea Gang?

349
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:24,699
I mean Yan Jin. Was there anything strange about him?

350
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:30,260
Come on. Kill me!

351
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:48,920
I'm not sure why, but today, in the prison,

352
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:52,640
he seemed to purposely provoke Lu Ping to pursue his own death.

353
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:59,620
As I expected, he is exchanging the remaining of his life for something.

354
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:03,200
I'm afraid he has someone to protect.

355
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:08,360
Do you mean that there's still someone else behind him?

356
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:12,760
I have a feeling it's in the Qingshan Building outside the mountain.

357
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:19,820
[Yuezhou Lodging]

358
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:32,980
General, Miss has run away again.

359
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:37,840
She left you a letter saying that since she's come, she must compete at the Big Dipper.

360
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,799
She asks you not to worry and mentioned that she will come back soon.

361
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,140
Should we send people looking for her?

362
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:46,720
What if she makes trouble again?

363
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,419
She has already grown up so I can't restrain her anymore.

364
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,240
Might as well!

365
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:57,599
It will be difficult escorting a criminal so she doesn't have to bear this.

366
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:00,220
- I understand.
- Wait!

367
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:07,780
Check the criminal cart again later, in case anything happens.

368
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,300
Yes.

369
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:20,700
Qin Sang must be angry with her brother for she hates being bored.

370
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:24,360
It would be difficult for her to go home and be a lady of the manor.

371
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:32,340
It really is true that men in love can be very stupid.

372
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:36,759
Being a lady of the manor isn't like being in prison, you don't have to worry.

373
00:29:36,759 --> 00:29:39,700
Eldest Senior left without saying anything.

374
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,580
Who knows where he went off to.

375
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:44,140
Eldest Senior has Miss Ling accompanied.

376
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:46,250
Why don't you take care of your master?

377
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:51,019
Master. Master!

378
00:29:51,019 --> 00:29:52,740
Who is it?

379
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:58,859
Your ears are too sharp. How boring!

380
00:29:58,859 --> 00:30:00,960
Why did you come?

381
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,019
My brother has to escort Yan Jin so I can't do much to help.

382
00:30:05,019 --> 00:30:08,260
That's said, I can escort you to the Big Dipper.

383
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:11,800
And also do some competing there.

384
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:16,680
And then after that, Lu Ping can escort you back to Kaifeng from the Big Dipper.

385
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:18,959
Can you stop?

386
00:30:18,959 --> 00:30:20,880
Why can't we?

387
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,500
When the time comes, I'll personally escort you and make your brother angry, too.

388
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:38,239
What a bad luck! To run into you, a mad woman, on such a bad day,

389
00:30:38,239 --> 00:30:40,260
I'd rather die.

390
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:43,659
How can I let you die before I'm tired of ridiculing you.

391
00:30:43,659 --> 00:30:45,479
Now that the Mountain and Sea Gang has fallen.

392
00:30:45,479 --> 00:30:47,460
We are both like homeless people.

393
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:51,180
How can the marvelous empire of the Mountain and Sea Gang be over that easily?

394
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:54,239
- Where exactly are you taking me?
- We are here.

395
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,319
Come on.

396
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,879
- Kill me!
- Lu Ping, calm down!

397
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,180
What he said may not be all true.

398
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:25,830
He's purposely provoking you. Don't fall into his trap!

399
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:40,540
I'm already here but your mind seems elsewhere.

400
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,900
Brother, do you have something on your mind?

401
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,420
I just don't understand.

402
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:52,540
Why did Yan Jin insist on taking me to the Mountain and Sea Gang?

403
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:56,540
He was in Yuezhou, too, so why did he want to take me back?

404
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:59,700
Also that day in the prison, he tried to provoke me repeatedly.

405
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,260
It seems that he was protecting someone.

406
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:04,530
Someone is more important.

407
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:07,839
It is all over now, are you overthinking it?

408
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,960
If you still feel something is odd, I'll go back to investigate with you.

409
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,300
Let's go!

410
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:57,720
Master Yan, you had already left so I don't understand why you came back again.

411
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,900
I will say it clearly.

412
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:04,120
I suspect that Yan Jin was not in charge of the Mountain and Sea Gang.

413
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,859
Someone else is behind him.

414
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:07,599
Things in the the pugilist world should be dealt with by the people of the pugilist world.

415
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:11,520
Please hand over Yan Jin to Wuji Manor to investigate.

416
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,550
After I find out who's behind him,

417
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:17,240
I will escort him to Kaifeng to die.

418
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:27,060
A sect can even dare to block a criminal cart.

419
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:30,280
The emperor here seems

420
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,360
to have little authority.

421
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:38,540
Master Yan, this is not a small matter.

422
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:40,739
Please don't go against His Majesty.

423
00:33:40,739 --> 00:33:45,660
General Qin, the reason I want Yan Jin, is just for the sake of His Majesty.

424
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:49,199
I already have my orders, I can't agree to this.

425
00:33:49,199 --> 00:33:53,820
But I will think about what you said.

426
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:58,320
Right now, please don't hinder me.

427
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:04,280
Do you think you and these people can stop me?

428
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,799
Listen, Agile Dragon Army! Wuji Manor is attempting to steal the criminal.

429
00:34:09,799 --> 00:34:11,429

[Peace and Prosperity]

482
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:17,399
Young Master Xifan, with Young Lord Mo Lin around, Miss should be out of danger.

483
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:29,160
Lu Ping, I've come to visit Qin Sang.

484
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:33,479
- Is she alright?
- Eldest Senior, don't you think you owe me an explanation?

485
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:38,740
Why did you leave without saying anything?

486
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:41,960
And then suddenly appear and try to take Yan Jin?

487
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:45,239
There is someone else behind the Mountain and Sea Gang, I didn't want to startle them.

488
00:40:45,239 --> 00:40:47,420
Then why didn't you discuss it with me?

489
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:53,299
If you had talked with me, even if you used me as the bait or whatever,

490
00:40:53,299 --> 00:40:56,259
it wouldn't turn out to be like this now.

491
00:40:56,259 --> 00:40:59,379
Lu Ping, it was urgent so this was the only decision I could make.

492
00:40:59,379 --> 00:41:02,080
I also have my responsibilities to bear as well.

493
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,160
That's true!

494
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:11,040
Yan Xifan, you changed your family name.

495
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:15,900
You are the young master of Wuji Manor now, is that it?

496
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,800
Such an important identity!

497
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,360
You only do what you think is important.

498
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:26,320
This ordinary relationship between brothers...

499
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:29,300
you look down on it now, don't you?

500
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,599
Lu Ping, how can you think that?

501
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:35,640
I'm sorry about what happened to Qin Sang, but I hid the information from you for your own safety's sake.

502
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:38,060
I don't regret it.

503
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:40,040
For my sake?

504
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,879
This isn't the first time you've done something for my sake.

505
00:41:44,879 --> 00:41:48,820
In the Fighting Hall in Jin back then, you went undercover without talking to me.

506
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:50,820
You almost died.

507
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:53,880
Do you have any idea how much torment I was under?

508
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,620
And again, this time,

509
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:02,550
you acted on your own without talking to me.

510
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:05,540
You say that we are good brothers,

511
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:08,920
but whenever something happens, you push me away.

512
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:14,340
Do you think I'm such a useless someone who only needs help all the time?

513
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:19,760
We are brothers!

514
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:24,360
Doesn't that mean we should have each other's backs?

515
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:29,340
Rely on each other and trust each other?

516
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:31,160
Lu Ping,

517
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,040
I…

518
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:39,780
Since that's the case, remember this well!

519
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:43,079
The Mountain and Sea Gang is my enemy.

520
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:45,560
It is none of your business!

521
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,600
Lu Ping.

522
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:54,559
Young Master Xifan, Lu Ping is just angry. Don't—

523
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:58,819
This matter is between me and Lu Ping, outsiders don't need to bother.

524
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:05,400
I'm sorry! I shouldn't have done that.

525
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:13,860

[Ending OST: "The Paper Boat"]
[by Zhiqian Xue — Singers: Zhiqian Xue and Kewei Yu]

527
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:35,780
♫ Waiting to be buried by the lake in the town, ♫

528
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:41,850
♫ the White Paper Boat drifting with sorrow. ♫

529
00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:47,640
♫ Lights on the other side of the sea ♫

530
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:56,330
♫ punched fingertips in the red water tower. ♫

531
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:05,730
♫ Watch the little boat churning, laughing at the ordinariness. ♫

532
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:10,020
♫ Like a kite being pulled into a low altitude, ♫

533
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:15,520
♫ I smiled to the leaving person. ♫

534
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:19,820
♫ The more spotlight, the more vivid the story. ♫

535
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:24,720
♫ Laughing like the moon, ♫

536
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:29,230
♫ regretting the lighthouse broke in the waves, ♫

537
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:36,620
♫ I call the Milky Way that isolates us all, blue. ♫

538
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:43,960
♫ Like a moat built under the sea, ♫

539
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:48,760
♫ waiting for the words on the paper boat to disappear, ♫

540
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:55,900
♫ there must always be someone who doesn’t remember listening to the other. ♫

541
00:44:57,850 --> 00:45:03,190
♫ Anyone who is correctly guessed will end in disfavor. ♫

542
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:07,590
♫ You are particularly touched but others consider it ordinary. ♫

543
00:45:07,590 --> 00:45:12,820
♫ Like the author, roughly put down with a weak stroke, ♫

544
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:17,360
♫ the writing boat on the lake was just like a paper crane in the air. ♫

545
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:22,160
♫ Laughing like the moon, ♫

546
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:26,860
♫ regretting the lighthouse broke in the waves, ♫

547
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:35,230
♫ I call the Milky Way that isolates us all, blue. ♫

548
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:41,830
♫ Can a moat be built on the seabed? ♫

549
00:45:41,830 --> 00:45:46,230
♫ Wipe all the words on the paper boat! ♫

550
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:53,590
♫ Please let someone not remember and don't tell another! ♫

551
00:45:55,890 --> 00:46:00,660
♫ Hide the reluctance between words ♫

552
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:05,240
♫ Unfortunately, I (you) are an average author ♫

553
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:13,580
♫ No matter how you (I) describe the rest, it's unnecessary! ♫

554
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:23,810
♫ Don't describe my unfulfilled promise! ♫

555
00:46:23,810 --> 00:46:32,540
♫ Don't interpret my hidden fire-smoke! ♫

556
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:41,610
♫ Don't let the paper boat in the rough wave chasing me! ♫

557
00:46:41,610 --> 00:46:50,230
♫ Don't wait until it's over to know there are you and me! ♫
