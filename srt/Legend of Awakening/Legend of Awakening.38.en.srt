00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,940
♫ The dark green sea is hazy ♫

3
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:32,780
♫ dissipating in a flash ♫

4
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:36,700
♫ Rivers and lakes divide the world ♫

5
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,890
♫ Ten thousands arrows are firing at once ♫

6
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:44,020
♫ Who has time to worry? Who loves the color of blood? ♫

7
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:47,800
♫ At that time, spirits are high ♫

8
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,590
♫ Who calls the world his home?
Who dares let his horse freely run? ♫

9
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:54,380
♫ Silently, tears form in the death of night ♫

10
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:58,320
♫ Heroes are cutting all ties, ♫

11
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,060
♫ giving up whether it's life or death, ♫

12
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,230
♫ never asking what the cost is ♫

13
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:09,870
♫ Good and evil must be distinguished ♫

14
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:13,760
♫ The wind blows off the snow ♫

15
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,560
♫ On the body, etch multiple scars, ♫

16
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,750
♫ wandering all over the world, ♫

17
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:25,160
♫ only wish to ask for answers from this world ♫

18
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:29,220
♫ A teenager doesn't have to be a hero ♫

19
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,130
♫ There is no need for flowers in the dream ♫

20
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:35,180
♫ Destiny need not be afraid ♫

21
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:40,710
♫ Because you have him all the way, ♫

[Seven Martyr Court]

30
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:55,400
Do you know why it is called the Mountain and Sea Gang?

31
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,120
It's because I want to tell those people from then

32
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:03,500
that their guilt will never go away.

33
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,740
Don't you want to go back to the gang to meet your parents?

34
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,020
What did you say?

35
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:30,439
Your parents loved you and cared about you.

36
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:35,540
It's too bad that they died at the hands of the Mountain and Sea Gang.

37
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,600
You saved me.

38
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,420
Why do that to me?

39
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,339
Back then, if it weren't to save you,

40
00:04:00,339 --> 00:04:02,919
Your parents wouldn't have lost their power.

41
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:08,260
And if it weren't to protect me, they wouldn't have been cheated by Yan Qiuci.

42
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:13,060
Zhai wouldn't have invaded the land of Dan.

43
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:16,360
Do you think Guo Youdao and Chu Min haven't noticed?

44
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:21,000
They were lying to you in order to protect Yan Qiuci.

45
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,020
You and I are the same.

46
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,100
Men!

47
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,160
Take him back.

48
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,500
No need to lock him up.

49
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,359
He already has nowhere to go.

50
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,260
- Yes.
- Yes.

51
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,860
Lu Ping.

52
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,580
Can't you tell?

53
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,940
He wants to be alone.

54
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:33,800
You are too inconsiderate.

55
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:39,359
Lu Ping, you are a disciple of Guo Youdao and Big Dipper.

56
00:05:39,359 --> 00:05:43,200
In this world, there's no prison that can hold you.

57
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,100
When Master was alive,

58
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,700
as clever as he was,

59
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:58,300
you both never went to avenge my parents.

60
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,540
Is it because you didn't know?

61
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,000
Or because you didn't want me to know?

62
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,730
- Lu Ping.
- Don't say anything more.

63
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:16,920
Old Guo sacrificed his life for me,

64
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,460
just so I could continue living a lie

65
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,900
and even end up working for the enemy.

66
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,540
He didn't want you to give up.

67
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:35,700
He wanted you to live.

68
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,780
One doesn't give up

69
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,780
because they have a reason to live.

70
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,640
Or at least had a reason.

71
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:16,079
Chief, the commander's seal has been sent to Liu Yange.

72
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:18,800
His mission will be finished soon.

73
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,700
We will discuss the war against Shuo.

74
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:32,919
Master, how about I find some medicine to remove your scars?

75
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:34,800
When we rebuild Dan again,

76
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,060
with your noble blood, you will be back on the throne.

77
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,140
Teacher,

78
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:48,160
you have helped me for 19 years.

79
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:53,940
All these years, every day I only thought about avenging my brother.

80
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:59,700
But just then, when I was talking with Lu Ping,

81
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:03,340
I realized I couldn't remember what my brother used to look like.

82
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,740
The only thing I can remember...

83
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,480
is this scar.

84
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:20,360
Perhaps it's my motivation to keep going.

85
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:25,040
It's right of you to think like that.

86
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,100
Although Lu Ping was captured,

87
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,340
but Wuji Manor isn't a mess right now.

88
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:35,549
Instead, they are contacting other people in Jianghu.

89
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:41,260
Yan Qiuci and his men can hold on for a bit longer.

90
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,019
It's the rabbit fighting the eagle.

91
00:08:44,019 --> 00:08:48,760
He isn't fighting for his life but kicking as he's dying.

92
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:53,680
Now that Lu Ping has come back, Lin Tianyi should move faster.

93
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:59,860
I will be back in the south when we have enough Force Eaters.

94
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,280
I will go now to start preparing.

95
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,520
[Older Brother - Leng Xiutan]

96
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,500
Brother, you were kind and merciful,

97
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:22,240
but you and your wife lost your lives.

98
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,540
I had originally wanted Lu Ping to live in peace.

99
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:30,400
But Zhai destroyed my country.

100
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:36,420
A day doesn't go by where I don't remind myself that I can't be soft-hearted.

101
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,280
That I can't make the same mistakes you did.

102
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,320
Now your son has come back.

103
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:48,020
It's time to get our revenge.

104

[Wuji Manor]

105
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:04,380
With the seal with the Mountain and Sea Gang, Jin will be attractive in the eyes of

106
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:07,159
a general, since it's located on the border.

107
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:09,299
Send messages to all the sects.

108
00:10:09,299 --> 00:10:15,520
Ask them to share their skills generously and send disciples to Jin.

109
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,420
Yes.

110
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:33,400
Miss Qin, are you here to take me to Kaifeng for punishment?

111
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:37,640
Have you already prepared yourself?

112
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,999
Lu Chenfeng died because of me.

113
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,240
His Majesty's plan was ruined by me.

114
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:47,000
How could His Majesty not kill me?

115
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,980
Do you think you deserve to die?

116
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:58,080
I have made contributions and mistakes in my life.

117
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:02,510
Since it's already done, I'm not afraid of the consequences.

118
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:07,320
I would just like to ask you for more time,

119
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,340
to arrange the alliance against the gang.

120
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:16,520
I entered Jianghu when I was young.

121
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:21,500
Before I leave, the last thing I want to do is leave with a clear conscience.

122
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,500
Since we are facing a powerful enemy.

123
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,200
I will set off for Kaifeng tomorrow.

124
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,600
I will plead to His Majesty to pardon you from death.

125
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,999
You have to protect the border

126
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,820
and make no mistakes.

127
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:42,580
I never thought you would be so generous.

128
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,920
I haven't forgiven you.

129
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:52,080
You killed people for your own lust and destroyed Lu Ping's life.

130
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,820
You can't make up for all your mistakes with your death.

131
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59,280
But you indeed have made contributions to the country.

132
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:04,060
Your mistakes don't cover your contributions.

133
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,780
I have said what I wanted to say.

134
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:09,040
Please take care of yourself.

135
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,340
Qin Sang, I heard that you're getting ready to set off for Kaifeng.

136
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:36,499
You want to go even with the cold toxin in your body? Do you want to die?

137
00:12:36,499 --> 00:12:40,720
Didn't you say that the poison cannot be removed?

138
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,200
Every day you continue to live is a blessing. I will find a way to save you.

139
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,180
Moreover, if Lu Ping returns and finds that you died because of me,

140
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:51,360
he'd kill me.

141
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,420
Qin Sang,

142
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:09,080
do you think the Mountain and Sea Gang had a plan when they imprisoned Lu Ping.

143
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,200
So they won't kill him.

144
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:16,880
Then he.... Can he still be saved?

145
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,720
Mo Lin,

146
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:26,100
has Su Tang not eaten anything since Lu Ping was captured?

147
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:30,260
No matter how much I urge her, she won't listen. Women are troublesome.

148
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:34,060
Cook her a good meal and bring her to me.

149
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,039
I have found a way to save Lu Ping.

150
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,440
Really?

151
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:52,739
Master, why don't you say anything? Don't you want to save your brother the most?

152
00:13:52,739 --> 00:13:56,680
One moment you don't care about my brother, the next, you want to save him.

153
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,540
What do you mean exactly?

154
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,920
When I stopped you before, it wasn't the right time yet.

155
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,000
Now is a good time to finish all this in one move.

156
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:13,860
The Mountain and Sea Gang is in the north. It is hard for the army to fight.

157
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:17,960
Even if I take the army, I can't win easily.

158
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:24,359
Now that the gang has the commander's seal, it will cooperate with Dan. They will hold a meeting.

159
00:14:24,359 --> 00:14:28,440
Do you mean that we can sneak in to save him?

160
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:35,300
I already had Wen Rui searching for information. The mission from Dan has already set out.

161
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:38,399
They must pass through the mountains here.

162
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:42,660
If we secretly hide the army here and attack them at the right time,

163
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:47,000
you two can sneak into the mission and into the Mountain and Sea Gang.

164
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,540
So, this whole time you have been waiting was for this opportunity?

165
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:57,799
Master, I even said you wronged her. I have a powerful intuition.

166
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,820
You won't go with us to save him?

167
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:08,900
Who knows? My brother could be waiting for you.

168
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:21,440
You're not the only one with a brother, I had one too.

169
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:26,400
The responsibilities he left, I have to shoulder.

170
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,460
Therefore, Su Tang, I entrust Lu Ping to you.

171
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:37,719
Then I'll definitely bring him to see you. He'll figure out the misunderstanding at Wuji Manor. Just wait for me.

172
00:15:37,719 --> 00:15:39,220
Qin Sang.

173
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,960
Then I'll beg another favor from you.

174
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:46,240
After you save Lu Ping, take him as far away as possible.

175
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,240
After the war is over, I'll come and look for you and your brother.

176
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,080
Okay. You promise?

177
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:01,099
Qin Sang, if we do this, then there must be someone who can lead the Agile Dragon Army.

178
00:16:01,099 --> 00:16:06,879
I can fight sometimes, but I can't lead an army.

179
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:12,300
Be at ease. We have a more suitable person.

180
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,100
But it depends on whether he's finally understood everything.

181
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:43,420
Since the Mountain and Sea Gang left, you have been hiding in your room.

182
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:46,780
Do you plan to not say anything or see anyone for the rest of your life?

183
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:50,760
The war will begin. I will go back to Kaifeng tomorrow.

184
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,100
Su Tang and Mo Lin will take the Agile Dragon Army to rescue Lu Ping.

185
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,780
The Mountain and Sea Gang will cooperate with Dan.

186
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:05,330
You want to use the Dan mission.

187
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,210
You were able to think of a solution so quickly.

188
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:12,820
The one who leads the army has to be you.

189
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:17,720
Qin Sang, it is a severe crime to use the Agile Dragon Army without informing His Majesty.

190
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,109
Do you want to die?

191
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:21,190
That's why I need you.

192
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:30,380
His Majesty wants young officials to connect the court and Jianghu.

193
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,490
Without Lu Ping,

194
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:37,200
you are the best choice.

195
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:43,580
When I get back to Kaifeng, I will buy more time for you.

196
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:48,040
At the same time, if you can save Lu Ping with the Agile Dragon Army

197
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:53,680
and serve the court ever after, then we are using the Agile Dragon Army appropriately.

198
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:59,940
Do you mean for me to serve in the court?

199
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,440
I know you don't want to.

200
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:08,380
You entered Jianghu to live a free and happy life.

201
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:13,580
But in this world, there is something more important than happiness.

202
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:19,640
I know you've always missed the days in Zhaifeng.

203
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,860
But... we have to grow up some day.

204
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,700
You have to find your own way.

205
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,040
Attendent!

206
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,700
Young Master.

207
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,300
I want to have a bath.

208
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,920
Yes. I will go prepare it right now.

209
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,880
Father.

210
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,020
How's the recovery of your injury going?

211
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,900
I am fine.

212
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:19,840
Father, Lu Ping can use five pneumas and he has The Horn.

213
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:25,540
If he wanted to kill you, I couldn't have withstood even one move.

214
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:30,900
Lu Ping thinks of the country. I can't give up on him.

215
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:35,220
I've come to bid you farewell.

216
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:43,100
I promised Qin Sang to take the Agile Dragon Army to save Lu Ping.

217
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:47,360
I will go to Kaifeng after that and work for His Majesty.

218
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:52,420
In the future, I won't be with you anymore.

219
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:57,880
Are you doing this because you think I wronged Lu Ping? I don't need you to make up for the mistakes I made.

220
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:02,319
If you hadn't done what you did back then, his parents wouldn't have died.

221
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,459
Wuji Manor, which united the martial arts circles and protects the country, wouldn't exist either.

222
00:21:06,459 --> 00:21:10,199
It's already hard to tell right from wrong. I am not qualified to evaluate this.

223
00:21:10,199 --> 00:21:13,140
But I know the reason why this tragedy happened back then.

224
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:19,980
His Majesty was right. We need a bridge between the court and Jianghu.

225
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:24,499
We are facing the enemy, Lu Ping is missing, and I'm the only suitable candidate.

226
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,240
You've only ever wanted to be a man in Jianghu since you were young.

227
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,599
It is not something glorious for people from Jianghu to become officials. It's a yoke.

228
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:39,380
You've taken on too many responsibilities upon yourself.

229
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,700
Everyone has things they want to do.

230
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:46,540
But growing up is about doing things that should be done.

231
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:54,020
I have already made my decision. Please help me accomplish it.

232
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:45,620
Young Master, I heard that you're going to Kaifeng with the lady to work for His Majesty.

233
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,710
I'm sorry, Ziyan.

234
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:53,300
I promised you to take you traveling in the central plains and to live in seclusion.

235
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,260
I've broken this promise.

236
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:59,160
There's no need to say that. I'm completely willing to go with you.

237
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:04,900
Only when I'm with you do I feel the happiness humans feel; the happiness that I'm meant to feel.

238
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:08,520
Wherever you go, I'm willing to go too.

239
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:14,760
From now on, don't call me Young Master, call me Xifan.

240
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,900
You have to stay at Wuji Manor.

241
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:23,160
After saving Lu Ping, I'll come for you.

242
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:28,079
Don't you need me to come and serve you?

243
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,980
It is dangerous. I can deal with it by myself.

244
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:52,159
Princess. Young Master Yan. Our men have been prepared. We can set off at any time.

245
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:57,940
Be careful on your way. I will talk to His Majesty in Kaifeng.

246
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:04,260
There's one more thing I don't understand. I think it's better if I discuss it with you.

247
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,379
Dan's military power is not better than Shuo.

248
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:12,100
Even if it is powerful, the Mountain and Sea Gang is still just a sect in Jianghu.

249
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:16,600
With Lu Ping, they just have one more with the power of awakening.

250
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:22,159
Can they conquer the army and change the situation with just one man?

251
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:27,839
Or have they made other preparations? And they're more confident because of Lu Ping.

252
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:34,480
If possible, please check in the Mountain and Sea Gang.

253
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:40,159
We are in the light while the enemies are in the dark. It's not good for us.

254
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,060
You all have to be careful.

255
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,360
After we leave today, we won't know when we'll see each other again.

256
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,220
Please take care.

257
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,840
Let's go.

258
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,280
Xifan!

259
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,160
Xifan.

260
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:26,140
From now on, you can only rely on yourself.

261
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:31,499
Father, protecting the border is important. There's no need for you to send us off.

262
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,300
Let's go.

263
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,480
Yan Qiuci cheated me. Yan Xifan leads the army without orders.

264
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:59,879
Qin Sang, you still want me to forgive such large crimes?

265
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,280
Are you trying to revolt?

266
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,820
Qin Sang, you are too self-indulgent.

267
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:13,260
Are you not afraid of ruining the reputation of Qin Qi and the Qin Family?

268
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:18,940
I know it's a crime to act on my own and I deserve to die.

269
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:24,320
But in the face of war, we can't afford to lose our power.

270
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:29,359
I can guarantee with my life that Yan Xifan will return with the army,

271
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,320
to serve under Your Majesty.

272
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:41,860
I have no choice but to punish you. Your marriage to Xifan will be canceled.

273
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:46,080
I will take away all the rewards and imprison you in your home.

274
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:51,320
If he'll be able to serve under me,

275
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:54,020
while all depend on his abilities.

276
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,499
Protect His Highness! Attack. Protect His Highness.

277
00:27:21,499 --> 00:27:23,380
Help!

278
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,900
Greetings Your Highness.

279
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:11,959
What did you even do as the Mountain and Sea Gang?! You let bandits rob others?!

280
00:28:11,959 --> 00:28:16,510
If without the safety guard to save me,
[Liu Yange, Prince of the Country of Dan]

281
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:19,540
who knows how much worse it would have been!

282
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,019
Where is your chief? Have him personally come and apologize to me!

283
00:28:24,019 --> 00:28:29,039
It is not convenient for the chief to come. I invite Your Majesty to please have a rest here.

284
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:34,220
What? You actually want me to stay here and wait?!

285
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,980
Do you want to die?

286
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,040
Your Highness.

287
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:45,219
Your Highness, when you're in the Mountain and Sea Gang, you should obey the rules here.

288
00:28:45,219 --> 00:28:53,300
And moreover, according to your relation, you should be addressing our chief and royal uncle.

289
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:01,180
Fine, we'll wait then.

290
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:09,420
There can't be bandits here,

291
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:13,320
unless someone has snuck in.

292
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,239
Go take a look.

293
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,540
Yes, Sir.

294
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,420
Someone's coming.

295
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,060
Clearly, there was someone just here.

296
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,639
Strange.

297
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,799
Where are they?

298
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,860
They may be in the front.

299
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,540
Go. Follow me.

300
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:56,940
Master.

301
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,960
Have you found anything strange?

302
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,629
- No.
- No.
- Continue the search.

303
00:30:00,629 --> 00:30:02,020
Yes!

304
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,159
You two, go check up there.

305
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,460
- Yes.
- Yes.

306
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:31,460
Tell Liu Song that I don't want such tasteless wine.

307
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,000
You think you're at Yaoguang Peak in Big Dipper?

308
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,040
You are just a prisoner.

309
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,040
Even if Chief saved you from death, don't think so highly of yourself!

310
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,500
Chief is ambitious.

311
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:55,860
Your romantic relationship was only something from the past.

312
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:01,240
After a time, what needs to be buried will eventually be buried.

313
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,280
What are you doing?

314
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:19,680
Liu Song ordered that no one here can hurt me.

315
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:24,060
Now I've been hurt.

316
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:26,479
Could this be considered as you disobeying your chief?

317
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,799
You hurt yourself! Don't think you can frame me!

318
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:42,599
You insane woman! Do you think that I can't hurt you even if you're under the protection of the chief?

319
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,739
Thank you, Master. Mo Lin, take Master out first. I will go find my brother.

320
00:31:56,739 --> 00:32:00,179
Find Lu Ping first. He doesn't have much time left.

321
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,680
If we keep going, do you think he can withstand it?

322
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:23,319
The chief already said that we're only keeping him for his blood. Who cares if he's alive or not?

323
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,959
Greetings, Royal Uncle.

324
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,620
I hope you are keeping well these days.

325
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:42,280
I'm on my last legs. Is His Majesty satisfied with the seal?

326
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,940
You've been recuperating in the North for some time,

327
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:48,280
you may not know what's going on right now.

328
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:54,580
We may have the seal now, but we're still not very powerful.

329
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:57,439
Shuo is still much more powerful.

330
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,880
Where does your confidence in all this come from?

331
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:05,020
You don't believe me.

332
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:08,920
Can you give me your men to try something?

333
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,340
Teacher.

334
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:36,999
Royal Uncle, is it your weapon against Zhai?

335
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,360
Please wait patiently.

336
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,960
Five pneumas!

337
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,420
The beggar is a martial artist skilled in five pneumas?!

338
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:30,500
We infused Xi Sui with the blood of a rare awakened individual.

339
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:34,579
This is our secret weapon which is more powerful than the power of awakening.

340
00:34:34,579 --> 00:34:36,900
We call them Force Eaters.

341
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,899
Uncle! Uncle, help! Uncle!

342
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:01,380
Don't worry. I've already drugged him.

343
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:04,180
He will be asleep for awhile now.

344
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:08,840
Chief, a little Force Eater was able to frighten His Highness into this state.

345
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:14,380
After we finish the plan, no one can stop us.

346
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:18,520
Are you satisfied now?

347
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,400
I was wrong.

348
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,540
Please forgive me for my rudeness from before.

349
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:36,040
May I boldly ask to take a man like him back to Dan,

350
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:41,080
to cheer people up and put my father at ease?

351
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:45,959
What you want, I can give.

352
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:51,700
Go back and tell His Majesty that however many he wants, I can make that many.

353
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:55,020
Thank you, Royal Uncle.

354
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,720
Help us!

355
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,460
- Please, we beg you.
- Help.

356
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:03,140
Let us out!

357
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:08,340
Master Chu Min, Are these all the sects which disappeared from Jianghu?

358
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,340
Why are they all here?

359
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,200
Most of them are skilled people who can use several pneumas.

360
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:20,739
The Mountain and Sea Gang captured them to impose Xi Sui and make themselves powerful.

361
00:36:20,739 --> 00:36:23,180
They are making killing machines for the Mountain and Sea Gang.

362
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:25,900
Then, don't they need to use my brother's blood?

363
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:39,140
Chu Min, I said before that you had too many opinions on things.

364
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:43,039
Go. Poison the two mice first.

365
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:46,720
As for this old woman, leave her alive for now.

366
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:52,699
Since the Chief said we can't hurt her, give her what she wants.

367
00:36:52,699 --> 00:36:55,950
I want her peacefully alive, so she can watch

368
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:59,380
her own disciples die.

369
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:13,940
Wen Rui, how long have they been in there?

370
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:22,080
For an entire day. They haven't signaled us at all.

371
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,640
I'm not sure what's going on.

372
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:29,660
Wait one more day, if there's no news, attack immediately.

373
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,720
Reporting! Young Master Yan. General Wen.

374
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:40,599
We just discovered a group of people on horses secretly leaving the Mountain and Sea Gang with a big box.

375
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,760
We haven't figured out what it is.

376
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,960
It can't be Lu Ping can it?

377
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,279
Send a troop of our men to follow them and try to investigate if possible.

378
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,519
Yes, Sir. Let's go.

379
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:59,659
Lin Tianyi, let us out. Otherwise, I will…

380
00:37:59,659 --> 00:38:02,040
What are you going to do?

381
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,200
I will ask my master to fight you.

382
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,480
What did you do to my brother?!

383
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,020
Mind your own business first.

384
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:18,020
This is our gang's poisonous smoke.

385
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:23,300
The longer it takes you to die, the more painful it'll feel.

386
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:30,260
I really want to know how long it'll take you to die.

387
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:33,480
Lin Tianyi, you…

388
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,420
I want her peacefully alive, so she can watch

389
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:55,740
her disciples die.

390
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:02,080
See how good these children are! They're just like us when we were young.

391
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,699
We prepared some crab porridge for you. Please come taste it.

392
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:23,040
Master, please accept our respects.

393
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,039
Thank you, Master Chu Min.

394
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:52,360
You will regret it later if you lie to your heart.

395
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,160
Master Chu Min, have you seen Qin Sang?

396
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:05,499
I am sleeping. Stop yelling! Get back to your training!

397
00:40:05,499 --> 00:40:07,040
All right, then I'm off.

398
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:15,199
Wait. He really just left like that?

399
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,540
