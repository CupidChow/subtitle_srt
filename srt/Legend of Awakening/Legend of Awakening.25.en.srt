00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:28,940
♫ The dark green sea is hazy ♫

3
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:32,800
♫ dissipating in a flash. ♫

4
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,630
♫ Rivers and lakes divide the world. ♫

5
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,050
♫ Ten thousands arrows are firing at once. ♫

6
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,970
♫ Who has time to worry? Who loves the color of blood? ♫

7
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:47,760
♫ At that time, spirits are high. ♫

8
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,670
♫ Who calls the world his home? Who dares let his horse freely run? ♫

9
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:54,330
♫ Silently, tears form in the death of night. ♫

10
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:58,270
♫ Heroes are cutting all ties, ♫

11
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:02,070
♫ giving up whether it's life or death, ♫

12
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,270
♫ never asking what the cost is. ♫

13
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:09,820
♫ Good and evil must be distinguished. ♫

14

♫ The wind blows off the snow. ♫

15

♫ On the body, etch multiple scars, ♫

16

♫ wandering all over the world, ♫

17
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:25,250
♫ only wish to ask for answers from this world. ♫

18

[Episode 25]

29
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:29,420
Only if you help me save Su Tang, can I save myself with confidence.

30
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:32,039
Okay, I promise you.

31
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,100
Young Lord Lu,

32
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,520
I'm willing to go with Miss to rescue Miss Su Tang.

33
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,359
Ziyan, you—

34
00:02:42,359 --> 00:02:44,719
You both have been taking care of me.

35
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:47,440
I have regarded you as my family a long time ago.

36
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:53,540
Young Lord Lu, if you still regard me as a friend, don't keep me out of this.

37
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,940
Might as well!

38
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,920
More people means more assurance.

39
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,340
Okay.

40
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:05,360
Then I entrust Su Tang's life to both of you.

41
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,320
What?

42
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,599
The Big Dipper had even broken into the prison just to rescue Lu Ping

43
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:22,220
so how could they just let Qin Qi take him back to Yuezhou for execution now?

44
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,640
Yes.

45
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,499
It was you, Young Lord Xu, who proposed to the chief that you could

46
00:03:31,499 --> 00:03:34,239
abduct Lu Ping from a small path under the mountain.

47
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,780
Now, you are one step behind Qin Qi.

48
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,600
I don't know how Young Lord Xu will explain this to the chief.

49
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:45,000
As long as the chief can give me a little more time, I can definitely change the situation here.

50
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:57,300
[Bring Xu Weifeng back. Don't alarm the Big Dipper.]

51
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,880
I don't think you'll have the chance.

52
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,820
Chief wants to see you.

53
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:17,770
General Qin.

54
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:19,860
- Open the door.
- Yes.

55
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,160
When do you plan on chopping off my head?

56
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,700
At noon tomorrow.

57
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:49,780
This is an explanation to Tan State and will also comfort Xu Tianbing's spirit.

58
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,100
Okay.

59
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:56,060
I still have time to have a dream.

60
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:02,460
How could you still fall asleep at a time like this?

61
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,220
Lu Ping,

62
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,340
you must have hated me.

63
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,460
I can only live until tomorrow.

64
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,440
Why should I hate you?

65
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,120
At first in Kaifeng, you were supposed to be the winner of the Pneuma Combat Convention

66
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,680
but you were framed by me.

67
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,600
Today, you took the initiative to save me in Yuezhou

68
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,280
but you are still being used by me to be the scapegoat.

69
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:45,140
I've sacrificed you several times.

70
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:49,200
You have reasons to hate me to the core.

71
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,060
You and I have different needs and reasons.

72
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,260
You did it for the Qin Family

73
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,620
and the Great Shuo State.

74
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,280
As for me,

75
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,380
I did it for a clear conscience

76
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,040
and for the people I care about.

77
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:19,820
Even if it were to happen again,

78
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:22,460
we would've made the same choices.

79
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,800
Since that's the case,

80
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,260
what's there to hate?

81
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,920
You are a talented person.

82
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:42,039
If I met you earlier, I would have taken you under my command at all costs

83
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:47,140
but it's too late to say that now.

84
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:59,680
Lu Ping, I have been unfair to you in this lifetime,

85
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,600
I will be your slave in my next life to repay you.

86
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,140
Get ready for your execution tomorrow.

87
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,910
Chief, Mountain Division Leader Zhou was defeated by Yan Qiuci that day.

88
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:38,900
We still have not found his whereabouts.

89
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:50,460
Young Lord Xu, your plan failed.

90
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:55,740
Young Lord Xu, one shouldn't do things beyond one's ability.

91
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:00,260
Otherwise, one would create more trouble for everyone else, am I right?

92
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:05,490
Chief, he is sick and useless now.

93
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:07,620
He also knows a lot the secrets of our gang.

94
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,640
Why don't we get rid of him?

95
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,280
Wait!

96
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,679
Chief, I still have another idea.

97
00:08:15,679 --> 00:08:18,699
Haven't you always wanted Lu Ping alive? Am I right?

98
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:21,919
You indeed know too much.

99
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,920
I could bring him back.

100
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,660
Chief, you're not going to trust him again, are you?

101
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,899
If you really want Lu Ping alive,

102
00:08:29,899 --> 00:08:32,100
I can go.

103
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,839
Lu Ping will be executed tomorrow.

104
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,809
Qin Qi will be strictly guarded.

105
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:37,759
Right now, Leader Zhou hasn't returned yet.

106
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:40,859
Yan Xifan is too obvious and there's no one else you can use.

107
00:08:40,859 --> 00:08:45,940
The only one who can bring Lu Ping back without being known is only me, Chief.

108
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,700
Tonight, at the ferry,

109
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,640
I'll only wait for you until the wee hours.

110
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,300
Okay.

111
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,379
It's too hard to break through.

112
00:09:17,379 --> 00:09:19,100
We'll only alarm the guards.

113
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,960
Do you have a way to sneak in?

114
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,259
The area is too large.

115

If we can't confirm the location of Miss Su Tang,

116
00:09:25,579 --> 00:09:27,279
I'm afraid that I will just alarm the guards.

117
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,940
We can't afford to alarm the guards.

118
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,039
Xu Weifeng hasn't been back for a long time.

119
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:38,000
Could he have already sent Su Tang out of the manor?

120
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,280
What should we do?

121
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:05,690
[Pure Wind Courtyard]

122
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,000
Don't worry! I've been guarding the entrance of his manor for the past 2 days.

123
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,300
I didn't close my eyes for even a second.

124
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,310
I swear in the name of the World's No. 1 Assassin

125
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:25,040
that Su Tang is definitely still in his manor.

126
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,540
Xu Weifeng did something.

127
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:43,140
He put a bunch of spy in the side courtyard

128
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,960
so I can't determine the exact location of Su Tang.

129
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,360
Also, during these past 2 days,

130
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,840
no one has carried a vessel that was large enough to fit a person, in or out the manor.

131
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:56,300
Besides, since he left the lodging,

132
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,920
he has added many guards to the manor.

133
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,720
So Su Tang must still be in the manor.

134
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,320
Lu Ping will be executed at noon tomorrow.

135
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,840
If he still has any ambition, he will definitely leave.

136
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:14,280
The only chance for us to save Su Tang is when he leaves

137
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:18,420
so whether or not there's a trace of Su Tang,

138
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,680
we still need to break in the manor.

I don't remember.

If I relax any little bit,

You're going to die first this way.

She is not only my master, she also is Su Tang.

162
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:33,079
I also have continuously blocked the acupuncture point using a silver needle, which can temporarily seal off the scent,

163
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:35,260
so no one can find you.

164
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,700
I will try my best to be gentle.

165
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,140
If it hurts, I have some candy here.

166
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,420
How is my brother?

167
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,460
Su Tang,

168
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:08,800
Lu Ping is very important to the Mountain and Sea Gang, isn't he?

169
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,100
What do you want to do to my brother?

170
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,960
I underestimated the Mountain and Sea Gang.

171
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,219
Originally, I wanted to use them to finish my own plan

172
00:14:18,219 --> 00:14:23,460
but I never thought I was controlled by them in the end.

173
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:28,220
They used me and then casted me aside like an old shoe.

174
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:32,640
Answer me! What do you want from my brother?

175
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,980
Weren't you the one who told me not to give up on my dreams?

176
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:44,540
Since Lu Ping is so important to the Mountain and Sea Gang,

177
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:47,700
then only when I get Lu Ping first,

178
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:51,520
will the Mountain and Sea Gang help me willingly.

179
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,100
Am I right?

180
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:01,340
Xu Weifeng, you can kill me

181
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,920
but you can't harm my brother.

182
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,880
How could I bear to kill you?

183
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:36,820
No matter what happens to Lu Ping, I will take good care of you for him

184
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,840
and will not let you get hurt again.

185
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:16,080
My scent can be sealed but the smell of blood can't be sealed.

186
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,760
Older Brother, I can't save you this time.

187
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:29,120
I just hope that you won't be dragged down by me and you can find some way of tiding over the crisis.

188
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,200
Mo Lin, you have to find me.

189
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,460
This man has a personal relationship with Qin Qi.

190
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,620
It's hard to guarantee that Qin Qi won't find someone to replace him.

191
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,959
General Xu is from Tan State.

192
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:52,340
The murderer should be taken back to Tan State by me for execution.

193
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:56,139
Young Lord Xu, I'm afraid... that will be out of line.

194
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,599
It is the order of the Minister of Defense, Minister Xu.

195
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,559
If you dare to violate, you may hinder the friendship between the two countries.

196
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,560
Yes, Young Lord Xu.

197
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,140
I'm already at death's door.

198
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,500
Can't I see a friendly face that makes me happy?

199
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,740
Do I have to see an enemy?

200
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,720
Lu Ping, I've said this before.

201
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,020
I've always regarded you as my friend.

202
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:43,760
Look! Qin Qi wants to kill you now.

203
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,960
I am here to save you.

204
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:14,070
[Pure Wind Courtyard]

205
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,500
Mo Lin, Ziyan will distract the guards later.

206
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,690
You and I will sneak into the manor.

207
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:33,460
I will stand guard while you go find Su Tang.

208
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,479
We leave the rest to God.

209
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,320
I don't believe in God but only in Su Tang.

210
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:43,630
She is my master so she must also be thinking of a way to notify us.

211
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:53,419
Ziyan won't be able to get much time. Let's split up!

212
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,760
Blood! It's the smell of Su Tang's blood.

213
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,380
I know where she is.

214
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,239
Master, I'm here to save you.

215
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,900
- Master.
- You…

216
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:15,820
Master. Master!

217
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,580
Master, are you okay?

218
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:22,040
- I will stop the bleeding.
- Okay.

219
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,739
Master! Master, don't scare me!

220
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,900
Young Lord Xu, you indeed do as what you say.

221
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:04,380
The Mountain and Sea Gang likes having a partner like you.

222
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,100
Senior Xu,

223
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,460
I even thought you had a huge ambition

224
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,840
but you are just a dog of the Mountain and Sea Gang.

225
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,430
I have brought Lu Ping here.

226
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:21,100
I want the same thing I wanted before.

227
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:25,539
The Mountain and Sea Gang and Tan State will work together to eliminate Shuo State. Otherwise,

228
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,960
even if I kill him,

229
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,280
I won't let the Mountain and Sea Gang succeed.

230
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:39,679
Okay, I promise you.

231
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:49,759
This Mountain and Sea Token shows my promise.

232
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:54,040
When I return to Mountain and Sea Gang, I will plan for this.

233
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,440
It's a firm promise!

234
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,940
Xu Weifeng,

235
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:04,500
do you really think Mountain and Sea Gang will be so kind?

236
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:08,800
You and I are the same to them.

237
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,780
As long as you are useless, you will be abandoned like an old shoe.

238
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:20,110
Lu Ping, you don't have to struggle and instigate anymore.

239
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:23,800
You lost your freedom once again.

240
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,340
You must be really desperate.

241
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,890
I've told you a long time ago.

242
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:33,660
No one can escape from the Mountain and Sea Gang.

243
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,600
Chief, you're wrong.

244
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,800
During these past few years,

245
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,440
the Wind Taker Institute and the Big Dipper have taught me a lot.

246
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,900
The first is that I have to

247
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,280
save myself.

248
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,439
Yan Xifan, you're awake?

249
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:15,119
The 2nd thing that Lu Ping and I learned at the Wind Taker Institute

250
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,120
is that great things can be achieved if brothers work together.

251
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:25,020
Now it seems like you are the one who is alone.

252
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:32,540
I heard that the Mountain and Sea Gang is really good at torturing their prisoners.

253
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:35,820
I'd like to see how many secrets of the Mountain and Sea Gang

254
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:38,360
you will spit out in the hand of the Agile Dragon Army.

255
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,780
Get ready to die tomorrow.

256
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,820
As long as you won't trouble me in the next life,

257
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,840
I can do you another favor.

258
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:54,020
Those who killed General Xu, colluded with Mountain and Sea Gang,

259
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:58,920
and caused disputes between Shuo State and Tan State will definitely appear tonight.

260
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:03,480
It just depends on whether or not General Qin is willing to put on a show with me.

261
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,740
Okay.

262
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,960
Then General Qin,

263
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:15,640
please return my weapon back to me.

264
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,559
- Take them away.
- Yes.

265
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,640
- You and Qin Qi planned this from the start.
- That is natural.

266
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:42,359
If General Qin didn't come out soon, I was afraid I was going to steal all the limelight.

267
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:46,440
Didn't we agree? You let Xu Weifeng get the Mountain and Sea Token.

268
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,240
I'll clean up the mess.

269
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,479
Qin Qi, there's no point in capturing me.

270
00:24:51,479 --> 00:24:54,559
Lu Ping killed Xu Tianbing. It's the truth.

271
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,999
If you cover for him, then you are covering up for a murderer.

272
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,640
Is that right?

273
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,760
Feng'er.

274
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:16,180
Dad, why are you here?

275
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,670
Minister Xu.

276
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:21,380
Xu Weifeng colluded with the Mountain and Sea Gang to kill the General of Tan,

277
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:23,399
with the intention of provoking a war between the two states.

278
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,320
Right now, we have solid evidence on this.

279
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,220
Minister Xu, please make a judicious judgment.

280
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,580
Weifeng,

281
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:37,079
I thought you felt inferior because you couldn't join the army.

282
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:41,540
I didn't expect that... you've fallen so far.

283
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:47,680
Minister Xu, we will leave your son to you to deal with.

284
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,380
Weifeng.

285
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,779
Weifeng. No. No.

286
00:25:55,779 --> 00:25:59,360
Lu Ping, tell them to let me go.

287
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,720
Otherwise, you won't see Su Tang ever again!

288
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,500
Using women as a bargaining chip, how could you talk about the country?

289
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:15,100
Su Tang, how is it possible that they found you?

290
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:20,240
Even if I give up my life, I won't let you hurt her.

291
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:27,700
Bao Niang wanted me to tell you that she hopes you won't make another mistake.

292
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,800
She asked me to bring you a few words.

293
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:33,100
She didn't understand your logic of ending war with a war.

294
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:36,580
She just hopes that there would be no more war.

295
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,380
Xu Weifeng,

296
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:45,860
you thought you were helping the common people

297
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:50,320
but you never knew what they wanted.

298
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,740
Ever since you collaborated with the Mountain and Sea Gang,

299
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,500
everything you've done has been wrong.

300
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,540
That's not it!

301
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:08,260
Not that. It's not that!

302
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,759
Weifeng, listen to your father.

303
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:14,570
If you repent, even if I have to give up being an official,

304
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:16,590
I will save your life.

305
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,259
Child, please repent.

306
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,180
Father,

307
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,400
do you still not understand?

308
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:39,400
I admit that I am overly ambition but I didn't do anything wrong.

309
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,350
I believe in ending war with a war.

310
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:43,790
I did it for our country!

311
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:47,840
The winner takes all in the pugilist world,

312
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,240
but I will never

313
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,760
give up.

314
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,300
Weifeng!

315
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,020
Don't go over there!

316
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:04,060
- Brother Xu!
- Weifeng, don't go over there!

317
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:07,479
- Brother Xu!
- Weifeng!

318
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,840
Weifeng!

319
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,000

Don't worry!

They've returned and settled down at the inn.

323

I've sent some guards there, too.

324
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:56,000
Yan Xifan had the Xi Sui method applied on him by someone when he was in the Mountain and Sea Gang.

325
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,260
He broke through the Pneuma of Essence by force so it took him a lot of effort,

326
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,660
causing him to be hurt by the rebound.

- Brother, I…

Lu Ping has been taking care of him for a few days.

330

You will meet Lu Ping later.

334
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:51,959
What's wrong with boss? He asked Ling Zi Yang to take care of Xifan instead of me.

335
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:56,779
Wouldn't Eldest Senior want to see a familiar face when he wakes up? Am I right, Master?

336
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,720
Master?

337
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:04,420
Actually, in addition to our Eldest Senior,

338
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:07,999
I also suffered a lot of injuries when I went to Yuezhou Lodging to save you.

339
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,460
Why don't you take care of me?

340
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,810
You look all right.

341
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:17,080
You didn't even scratch your skin.

342
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:21,919
Internal injury! That's all internal injuries.

343
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:31,620
Master, if you're unwilling to take care of me, I can take care of you instead.

344
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,360
Master.

345
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,860
Mo Lin, I am a little tired.

346
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,980
I want to take a walk alone.

347
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,460
Master,

348
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,360
how about I go with you?

349
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,280
I can even take you to fly with my Pneuma of Energy.

350
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:51,640
I already said that I want to be alone.

351
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:21,199
Young Hero Xifan, are you feeling better?

352
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,640
It's just a little injury.

353
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,000
Miss Ling, you don't need to worry too much.

354
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:36,899
Why are you being so polite? It's not a big deal to take care of you.

355
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,940
What are you talking about?

356
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:43,960
Look, Eldest Senior! Right now, Mo Lin is trying to cheer up my sister.

357
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:47,800
I don't want to do it myself and I also can't ask Qin Sang to take care of you.

358
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:51,340
I can only bother Miss Ling here to do so.

359
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,940
It's not a bother at all.

360
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:57,000
Young Hero Xifan saved my life that day while I was trying to break through my Pneuma after the Soul Splitting method.

361
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,560
Now, I am satisfied if I can do something for him.

362
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,760
Miss Ling is too serious.

363
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,880
Thank you then, Miss Ling.

364
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,880
You two are way too polite.

365
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,100
Who are you putting on an act for?

366
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,960
Speaking of acting,

367
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,500
you two are the best.

When did you two start acting?

00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:34,820
Xifan, a competition between us disciples,

370
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:37,220
it's too barbaric to use swords.

371
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,539
Do you still remember when we were at Wind Taker Institute, you forced me to study every day?

372
00:32:42,539 --> 00:32:44,880
Lu Ping, I have no time to gossip with you.

373
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,000
No? I was going to thank you in my next sentence.

374
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,900
Thanks to you, I was able to break through the six pneumatic powers.

375
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:55,280
The six pneumas are exquisitely powerful only when they're combined together.

376
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,400
Their strength relies on the internal power core.

377
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:01,900
Even though the Pneuma of Essence is powerful, it can be overcome by the Pneuma of Sound.

378
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:06,400
As long as the person's will is strong enough, he may be able to wake up.

379
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:25,180
You've said before that no one in Wind Taker can be left behind.

380
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:28,900
You're the Eldest Senior so you definitely can't fall behind.

The Mountain and Sea Gang wants to provoke a war between the two states.

I won't let them get their way.

why don't you let them be happy for a bit longer?

You mean we can work in collusion, forcing Xu Weifeng and the Mountain and Sea Gang to make a move?

to come up with this kind of idea.

That time during which I was hypnotized by the Mountain and Sea Gang,

403
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,360
was really like a nightmare.

Now, I am finally awake.

405

Eldest Senior, that wasn't a dream.

You can't feel this much pain in a dream.

Now, it's your turn to feel the retribution.

409
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,780
Even though the Mountain and Sea Gang's Xi Sui could improve your skill,

410
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:35,100
this is a short-term improvement and you definitely suffer quite a bit of backlash.

411
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:38,420
As the Eldest Senior, I couldn't be the weakest link.

00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:04,560
I will order the Agile Dragon Army to leave your country as soon as possible.

478
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,660
I will also tell His Majesty to release the prisoners of war as well.

479
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:12,160
You can also let your subordinates open the gate to settle the refugees.

480
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,119
General Qin has arranged everything properly.

481
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,960
I am happy to assist you.

482
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,280
Although Yan Xifan suffers the crime of conspiracy,

483
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:23,479
he was was under the control of the Mountain and Sea Gang's sorcery

484
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:26,359
and he didn't personally kill General Xu.

485
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:29,600
Besides, he has made up for his crimes later on.

486
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,720
I hope your country will be lenient with him.

487
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:38,760
Yan Jin and the Mountain and Sea Gang have done countless crimes in Shuo State.

488
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:41,639
His Majesty wishes to remand him to Kaifeng for a trial.

489
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,520
His Majesty has already ordered that all matters concerning the Mountain and Sea Gang

490
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,599
be handed over to your country.

491
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:49,500
General Qin, please do as you please.

492
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,560
Thank you, Minister.

493
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,420
How did it go?

494
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:05,380
The city gate will be reopened in two hours.

495
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,420
Thanks a lot.

496
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:11,820
Lu Ping, you have made great contributions this time.

497
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:15,100
Is it all that you're only requesting for the city gate to be reopened earlier?

498
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:17,360
You're not asking for anything for yourself, aren't you?

499
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,580
A high official with a high salary. A fancy manor.

500
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:22,720
Whatever you want, I can report to His Majesty

501
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,120
and try my best to help you get it.

502
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:33,160
I'm carefree and without any worries right now.

503
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:35,340
What do I want those things for?

504
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:40,700
I protected the people in this city from the plot of the Mountain and Sea Gang.

505
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:44,500
Watching them go back home and live a peaceful life,

506
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,440
I am already very happy.

507
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:55,199
After the peace talks between the two countries, Minister Xu will hold several celebrations in the city.

508
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:58,399
At that time, the common people will go out to celebrate together.

509
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,600
I suggest you go and take a look.

510
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,920
Go and see the city and those commonpeople

511
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,600
that you put your life on the line to protect.

512
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:10,040
That would be good but it just that...

513
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:13,780
I will be too lonely if I go alone.

514
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:16,379
Can I take Qin Sang with me? She likes the lively atmosphere.

515
00:42:16,379 --> 00:42:18,660
She will definitely be happy.

516
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:20,840
It's up to you whether or not you want to go alone.

517
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,880
You definitely can't bring Qin Sang with you.

518
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,960
She is the Eldest Miss of the Qin Family and a young lady of a noble family.

519
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,140
How could she show her face out in public?

520
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,180
Qin Sang wanders outside all day.

521
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:33,720
- Don't you have a guilty conscience saying that?
- You…

522
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,220
What I say goes.

523
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:39,020
It's none of your business.

524
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:41,079
Didn't you just tell me to ask for something for myself?

525
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:43,660
I want this. I am telling you,

526
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:47,900
I'll exchange my previous merit for Qin Sang to accompany me out for fun.

527
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:50,640
If you are worried about us, you can follow along.

528
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,540
I'm dignified as the Commander of the Agile Dragon Army.

529
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:56,280
I have many military affairs to deal with so how can I have this much time to idle around?

530
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:01,140
That's true, too! You probably can't do anything if you let Qin Sang stay by your side anyways.

531
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:02,539
You…

532
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:10,220
Fine! Considering your merit,

533
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,040
- it's just this time.
- That's great!

534
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,520
Thank you, General Qin.

535
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:18,319
Come out! He has already agreed.

536
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:22,790
I have the best brother in the world.

537
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:38,510
[Ending OST: "The Paper Boat"]
[by Zhiqian Xue — Singers: Zhiqian Xue and Kewei Yu]

538
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:44,590
♫ Waiting to be buried by the lake in the town, ♫

539
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:50,740
♫ the White Paper Boat drifting with sorrow. ♫

540
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:56,540
♫ Lights on the other side of the sea ♫

541
00:43:56,540 --> 00:44:05,120
♫ punched fingertips in the red water tower. ♫

542
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:14,610
♫ Watch the little boat churning, laughing at the ordinariness. ♫

543
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:18,910
♫ Like a kite being pulled into a low altitude, ♫

544
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:24,350
♫ I smiled to the leaving person. ♫

545
00:44:24,350 --> 00:44:28,680
♫ The more spotlight, the more vivid the story. ♫

546
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:33,620
♫ Laughing like the moon, ♫

547
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:38,120
♫ regretting the lighthouse broke in the waves, ♫

548
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:45,540
♫ I call the Milky Way that isolates us all, blue. ♫

549
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:52,830
♫ Like a moat built under the sea, ♫

550
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:57,560
♫ waiting for the words on the paper boat to disappear, ♫

551
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:04,980
♫ there must always be someone who doesn’t remember listening to the other. ♫

552
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:12,290
♫ Anyone who is correctly guessed will end in disfavor. ♫

553
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:16,460
♫ You are particularly touched but others consider it ordinary. ♫

554
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:21,830
♫ Like the author, roughly put down with a weak stroke, ♫

555
00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:26,200
♫ the writing boat on the lake was just like a paper crane in the air. ♫

556
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:31,110
♫ Laughing like the moon, ♫

557
00:45:31,110 --> 00:45:35,720
♫ regretting the lighthouse broke in the waves, ♫

558
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:43,630
♫ I call the Milky Way that isolates us all, blue. ♫

559
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:50,700
♫ Can a moat be built on the seabed? ♫

560
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:55,090
♫ Wipe all the words on the paper boat! ♫

561
00:45:55,090 --> 00:46:02,320
♫ Please let someone not remember and don't tell another! ♫

562
00:46:04,690 --> 00:46:09,560
♫ Hide the reluctance between words ♫

563
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:14,090
♫ Unfortunately, I (you) are an average author ♫

564
00:46:14,090 --> 00:46:22,010
♫ No matter how you (I) describe the rest, it's unnecessary! ♫

565
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:32,690
♫ Don't describe my unfulfilled promise! ♫

566
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:41,500
♫ Don't interpret my hidden fire-smoke! ♫

567
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:50,450
♫ Don't let the paper boat in the rough wave chasing me! ♫

568
00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:58,300
♫ Don't wait until it's over to know there are you and me! ♫
