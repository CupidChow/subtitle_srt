00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,940
♫ The dark green sea is hazy ♫

3
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:32,740
♫ dissipating in a flash ♫

4
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:36,620
♫ Rivers and lakes divide the world ♫

5
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,880
♫ Ten thousands arrows are firing at once ♫

6
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,990
♫ Who has time to worry? Who loves the color of blood? ♫

7
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:47,880
♫ At that time, spirits are high ♫

8
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,630
♫ Who calls the world his home?
Who dares let his horse freely run? ♫

9
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:54,360
♫ Silently, tears form in the death of night ♫

10
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,250
♫ Heroes are cutting all ties, ♫

11
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:02,050
♫ giving up whether it's life or death, ♫

12
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:04,210
♫ never asking what the cost is ♫

13
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:09,860
♫ Good and evil must be distinguished ♫

14
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:13,750
♫ The wind blows off the snow ♫

15
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:17,660
♫ On the body, etch multiple scars, ♫

16
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,740
♫ wandering all over the world, ♫

17
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:25,150
♫ only wish to ask for answers from this world ♫

18
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:29,210
♫ A teenager doesn't have to be a hero ♫

19
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:33,070
♫ There is no need for flowers in the dream ♫

20
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,120
♫ Destiny need not be afraid ♫

21
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:40,750
♫ Because you have him all the way, ♫

22
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:44,670
♫ experienced a handful of conquests, ♫

23
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:48,630
♫ overcame a number of challenges ♫

24
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,690
♫ From now on, happy and free! ♫

25
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:56,560
♫ The only wish is, with the world, ♫

26
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,700
♫ would come along the willing of change ♫

[Episode 39]

29
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:02,630
Go. Tell your master that I want to see him.

30
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,619
Master, this person has evil intentions. I'm afraid—

31
00:03:14,619 --> 00:03:17,319
I want to talk to Chu Min. Leave us.

32
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,620
Yes.

33
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,351
Back then, at Big Dipper, this wine

34
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,771
was also our favorite.

35
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,260
Back then, Guo Youdao and I went down the mountain to train.

36
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:05,039
I received the news at the critical moment of when I was breaking through the five Pneumas.

37
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:09,351
By the time I rushed back, it was too late.

38
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,231
I thought you were dead.

39
00:04:13,231 --> 00:04:20,211
I was so sad that I dropped from five Pneumas to three Pneumas.

40
00:04:20,211 --> 00:04:23,951
I was no longer the talented senior.

41
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:36,540
Guo Youdao was afraid that I would recall sad memories while seeing familiar sights so he sent me to Shining Sky.

42
00:04:37,019 --> 00:04:41,451
I don't remember the days... after that.

43
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:47,491
I seem to have gotten drunk every day. I haven't been sober since.

44
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,591
If you'll feel better when you're drunk,

45
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,439
then continue to stay here at the Mountain and Sea Gang and get drunk.

46
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:01,611
I was drunk so I could dream about being back at Big Dipper.

47
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,480
Little Six,

48
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,871
don't you also want to go back to Big Dipper?

49
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,860
Little Six,

50
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:27,711
when I was drunk, I wished countless times that you weren't dead.

51
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:35,780
Back then, the words you didn't finish saying to me before I went down the mountain,

52
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,791
I'll say them to you.

53
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:45,031
Can we go back to the past together?

54
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,651
Stay at the Mountain and Sea Gang.

55
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:07,820
Accompany me to see the end of His Majesty. I will treat you well.

56
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,711
Guo Youdao was right.

57
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,591
We've been apart for too long,

58
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:27,131
so long that no one can turn back.

59
00:06:27,131 --> 00:06:31,051
I've been drunk for 19 years.

60
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,131
I have to wake up now.

61
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:04,151
Master, I have some words to share with you before I die.

62
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,571
I don't want to call you "Master" all my life.

63
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,751
Actually, I want to…

64
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,131
I want…

65
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,260
Master, you've escaped.

66
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,660
Move.

67
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,520
- Su Tang, I haven't finished my words.
- You won't die this easily.

68
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,991
Save your words for later. Take this.

69
00:07:40,991 --> 00:07:44,240
Take the Thousand Pine Ruler, steal a carriage, and wait for me.

70
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,311
- But my brother, he—
- I will personally go and save him.

71
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,720
Let's go.

72
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,020
Master!

73
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:05,480
Brother! Brother, are you okay?

74
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,459
Master, don't cry right now. We have more important things to take care of.

75
00:08:08,459 --> 00:08:12,979
Yan Jin has already left to escort on the Dan State mission. If we want to leave, we have to leave now.

76
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,320
Come on.

77
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,920
Master, hurry. Hurry.

78
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:36,211
Guo Youdao and I let you down.

79
00:08:36,211 --> 00:08:39,651
We could have found the truth out earlier,

80
00:08:39,651 --> 00:08:43,071
but we didn't want to and dared not to

81
00:08:43,071 --> 00:08:48,651
until the misunderstandings got deeper and deeper, which led to the consequences of today.

82
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,379
Master Chu Min, they found out our whereabouts!

83
00:08:53,379 --> 00:08:55,699
Master, let's talk about this later.

84
00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:00,739
In the plays I've seen, usually, only a great hero says stuff like this before they die. Hurry and get in the carriage.

85
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,111
I can only accompany you to here.

86
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,071
Where should I go?

87
00:09:12,071 --> 00:09:16,211
Go to Carefree Valley. You can find the truth there.

88
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,079
Chu Min, how dare you assassinate the master?! I will kill you!

89
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,479
Master, you can't deal with them alone.

90
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,180
Master!

91
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:03,471
Master!

92
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,320
Go!

93
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:26,190
I am lucky to see Chu Min,

94
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:29,550
the master of Yaoguang Peak,

95
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:32,091
regain the five Pneumas.

96
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,371
Five Pneumas?

97
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:41,639
When she left Big Dipper that day, didn't she drop from four Pneumas to three?

98
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:47,839
I lost one Pneuma because I thought Liu Song was dead. I was haunted by demons.

99
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,599
Now that Liu Song is dead in my heart,

100
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,611
I am relieved of my demons.

101
00:11:54,611 --> 00:11:59,380
I don't need the help of my disciples... to deal with you all.

102
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,191
Come on.

103
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,739
Mo Lin, go back and save the master. Hurry!

104
00:12:15,739 --> 00:12:20,379
Brother, you'll be useless even if you go back right now. For the sake of Master, do not let anything happen to you.

105
00:12:20,379 --> 00:12:23,639
Let go of me! Don't you want to save our master?

106
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:30,179
Don't worry. I am clever. I have left a code for Master along the road.

107
00:12:30,179 --> 00:12:34,291
Once she escapes, she can definitely find us. Sit tight.

108
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,249
Stop!

109
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:51,391
- Stop!
- The Mountain and Sea Gang have caught up to us! Sit tight!

110
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,399
Stop!

111
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,829
Don't run!

112
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,810
Stop!

113
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,100
Brother, are you all right?

114
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,519
Brother, our senior brother is here to save us.

115
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,860
Senior Brother.

116
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,839
Why are you here?

117
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,771
I go wherever you go.

118
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:15,011
Xifan joined the imperial court and is bowing down to His Majesty

119
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,591
just so he could bring an army to save me.

120
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:26,551
He was afraid you would feel bad if you saw him so he didn't dare come see you directly.

121
00:16:26,551 --> 00:16:31,651
He chose... to be stationed out with the Mountain and Sea Gang in order to cover for you.

122
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,519
Actually, I think Senior Brother acted very righteously this time.

123
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,879
His father is his father. He is he.

124
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,931
You shouldn't blame him for what happened back then.

125
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,020
Brother, Senior Brother said that

126
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:52,170
if you still want to see him, he'll meet up with us here.

127
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:56,151
If you don't want to see him, you can just leave.

128
00:16:56,151 --> 00:16:57,811
It's up to you.

129
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:24,620
Master, what does he mean by this? Does he want to stay or leave?

130
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:28,840
Silly, can't you see that? There's a chance.

131
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:42,911
Didn't I tell you to stay in the manor and to not take a risk?

132
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:47,559
I am not a weak lady who can only stay at home. I also know martial arts.

133
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:52,099
Whether you're with the imperial court or the pugilist world, I want to stand by your side.

134
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:57,231
Are you still... going to find Lu Ping?

135
00:17:57,231 --> 00:17:59,911
Will he be willing to go back to Kaifeng with you?

136
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:14,811
If you keep something in your heart for a long time, it will become a knot in your heart that is impossible to undo.

137
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:20,540
It's better for us to face it now than to be strangers later.

138
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:26,751
As for Lu Ping, he can decide where to go himself.

139
00:18:26,751 --> 00:18:30,120
Reporting. Young Hero Yan. General Wen.

140
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:35,119
The troops we sent to track the Dan State mission hasn't reported back. I'm afraid something has happened.

141
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:38,440
General Wen, in order to avoid any problems, stay here with a few people.

142
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,459
Do not act rashly. I will go and take a look.

143
00:18:40,459 --> 00:18:42,551
Young Hero, be careful.

144
00:18:42,551 --> 00:18:44,220
I will go with you.

145
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,911
How did they die?

146
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,050
The wounds of the Agile Dragon Army and those on the mission are very similar.

147
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:15,010
They were killed by the same person.

148
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,379
The box is empty. What exactly were they carrying?

149
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,531
This person could actually use all five Pneumas.

150
00:20:08,531 --> 00:20:12,771
Fortunately his Pneumas... were extremely unstable.

151
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,060
He is the master of the Phoenix Ridge Gang.

152
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:24,979
He was only able to use three Pneumas before. How is he able to use all five Pneumas in such a short period of time?

153
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:31,620
Xifan, what should we do now?

154
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,651
Are we going to meet up with Lu Ping?

155
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,260
Dan State is not necessarily stronger in terms of military power when compared to Shuo State.

156
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:49,971
Even though the Mountain and Sea Gang is working with them, they are still a part of the pugilist world.

157
00:20:49,971 --> 00:20:54,451
Even if they catch Lu Ping, they will just have one more Awakener.

158
00:20:54,451 --> 00:20:58,570
Can they conquer the army and change the situation

159
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:01,010
with just one man?

160
00:21:01,011 --> 00:21:04,871
This seems to be the reason why they're doing all they can to get Lu Ping back.

161
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:11,039
If he found out, he would definitely feel extremely guilty, more and more as time goes on.

162
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,991
It's about the fate of Shuo State. We have to hurry back to Kaifeng.

163
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,780
Brother!

164
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:05,451
In the end, he dares not to come and meet me.

165
00:22:05,451 --> 00:22:09,579
Master, maybe Senior Brother was delayed by something.

166
00:22:09,579 --> 00:22:14,039
His injury is quite serious right now. Let's head to Carefree Valley first.

167
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:15,811
Then, what about Senior Brother?

168
00:22:15,811 --> 00:22:18,791
I... gave a map to Senior Brother a while ago.

169
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,520
Let's go.

170
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,851
You used the Pneuma of Essence on me.

171
00:22:52,851 --> 00:22:56,060
You were really cruel when you made up your mind,

172
00:22:56,060 --> 00:23:00,419
but I was betrayed once before. That won't happen again.

173
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:18,580
Master, Lu Ping and Yan Xifan are gone.

174
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:22,531
Everything is going according to your plan.

175
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:30,031
You let me steal the Thousand Pine Ruler and have Lu Ping escape.

176
00:23:30,031 --> 00:23:32,451
It turns out it was all a part of your plan.

177
00:23:32,451 --> 00:23:34,519
How far do you think Lu Ping can escape?

178
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:39,021
I will definitely get his Power of Awakening.

179
00:23:39,021 --> 00:23:42,651
I'll make sure he'll never be at ease no matter where he goes.

180
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,140
Stop.

181
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:03,539
Boss, why are we stopping suddenly? Our destination is just up ahead.

182
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,420
I want to take a walk.

183
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:26,920
Master, he didn't seem to talk much along the way.

184
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,431
He's not still thinking about that, is he?

185
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:53,671
I am not a good master.

186
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,691
I don't know the answers

187
00:24:57,691 --> 00:25:03,411
to some of your questions.

188
00:25:03,411 --> 00:25:07,551
I know the answers to some of them,

189
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,231
but I dare not get into them.

190
00:25:12,231 --> 00:25:18,219
The Zhai thief destroyed my country and disgraced my sect. This hatred must be avenged.

191
00:25:18,219 --> 00:25:22,820
If Big Dipper is going to be used by the Zhai thief, then this sect is no longer for me.

192
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,411
Brother, stop thinking about it.

193
00:25:32,411 --> 00:25:36,311
When Master Mo unlocks your Pneuma Confinement, it'll all be over.

194
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,731
Will it really be over?

195
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:47,671
Do you think Guo Youdao and Chu Min never noticed?

196
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:52,231
They were cheating you in order to protect Yan Qiuci.

197
00:25:52,231 --> 00:25:54,931
You and I are the same.

198
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:22,239
Master, the sixth lock on him seems to be breaking.

199
00:26:22,239 --> 00:26:23,580
Brother!

200
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:40,531
If you want him to live, hurry up and get him into the valley.

201
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:53,979
Isn't it a good thing to unlock the Pneuma Confinement? Why does he look like he's going to die?

202
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:58,399
Brother, don't think too much about the past.

203
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:09,351
The enemy killed my family. How can I not think about it?

204
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:18,711
Your parents begged me back then to place these Pneuma Confinements on you

205
00:27:18,711 --> 00:27:21,631
just so you could live a good life.

206
00:27:21,631 --> 00:27:26,511
They didn't want you focusing on hatred and dying from taking revenge.

207
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,851
What do you mean, Master Mo?

208
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:35,331
Back then, your parents saved me once.

209
00:27:35,331 --> 00:27:38,371
I owed them for that

210
00:27:38,371 --> 00:27:41,220
so I made them a promise

211
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:45,270
that I'd pay them back in my lifetime.

212
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:47,120
One day,

213
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:51,491
they came to Carefree Valley with a baby.

214
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:55,131
That was you who was dying.

215
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:57,331
Why was he dying?

216
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:04,151
Ordinary people can't bear the power of the six Pneumas.

217
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:09,671
You gained one Pneuma every month.

218
00:28:09,671 --> 00:28:14,719
Your whole body would burst and you would die when you gained all six Pneumas.

219
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,220
I used the Pneuma Confinement to block the six Pneumas.

220
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:20,771
Only in this way could you survive.

221
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:30,631
So you're saying that these locks were placed on me in order to save my life?

222
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:36,531
It's not easy to place the locks.

223
00:28:36,531 --> 00:28:41,299
In order to save you, they spent their skills that took their lifetime to cultivate.

224
00:28:41,299 --> 00:28:45,991
As for you, you only want to undo the locks.

225
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:52,760
Father, if Boss didn't untie the locks, he wouldn't have lived until today.

226
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,591
I don't care about your past messes.

227
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:04,111
Right now, you've unlocked five Pneumas.

228
00:29:04,111 --> 00:29:07,460
The only one left is extremely fragile.

229
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:13,420
Once your body and mind are unstable, the power of the Pneumas will overrun, and the lock will shatter.

230
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:17,771
At that time, you will definitely die.

231
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:28,720
Master, is there a way to undo the lock and save my brother's life?

232
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,811
No.

233
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,679
Am I doomed to die?

234
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:41,671
The Awakening has supreme force. He is powerful and domineering.

235
00:29:41,671 --> 00:29:47,451
It's a good thing you left the last Pneuma Confinement. You should be fine.

236
00:29:47,451 --> 00:29:53,371
For the sake of your parents, Carefree Valley can protect you.

237
00:29:53,371 --> 00:29:55,399
That's all I want to say.

238
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:59,991
You can decide whether you want to live or to die yourself.

239
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:17,119
Mo Lin, does your father dislike my brother and is purposely not treating him?

240
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:20,851
He doesn't like any strangers,

241
00:30:20,851 --> 00:30:25,671
but he wouldn't leave people to die. He is acting weird this time around.

242
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,511
Small tricks!

243
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:07,359
You've been an assassin for many years, and you've only learned these skills?

244
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:12,479
Liar. What you've learned all these years isn't much better than me.

245
00:31:12,479 --> 00:31:16,059
When did I lie? When did I become a liar?

246
00:31:16,059 --> 00:31:19,511
Observation is the basic quality of top assassins.

247
00:31:19,511 --> 00:31:24,159
If you encounter a disease that you can't cure, you will only study hard to find a solution.

248
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:27,299
You wouldn't say no to it. Why did you lie?

249
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:28,580
I…

250
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:36,419
Father, you have a solution. Right? Can't you help Lu Ping?

251
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:41,219
I can't undo it. Why do you care so much?

252
00:31:41,219 --> 00:31:43,959
Can you not undo it or are you afraid of getting into trouble with the Mountain and Sea Gang?

253
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,260
You…

254
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:51,939
Father, do you know why for so many years, I would rather be an assassin in the pugilist world

255
00:31:51,939 --> 00:31:53,880
than to stay in Carefree Valley?

256
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:58,311
It's because I don't want to see you like this. You have had such great medical skills since I was young,

257
00:31:58,311 --> 00:32:02,559
yet you never want to go out of the valley to cure others. You'd rather stay here in this valley and make medicine.

258
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:06,799
You're afraid of getting into trouble. Don't you want to be a hero or do something big in your lifetime?

259
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:10,500
What do you know? I told you to leave it alone so leave it alone.

260
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:15,139
You and Lu Ping just stay in Carefree Valley. Don't mess with that Mountain and Sea Gang.

261
00:32:15,139 --> 00:32:18,639
If anything happens to him again. I really can't save him! Understand?

262
00:32:18,639 --> 00:32:21,879
I wouldn't stay here if it wasn't for saving Lu Ping this time around.

263
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:26,959
I am destined to be a hero unlike you, a coward.

264
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,771
Yes.

265
00:32:38,771 --> 00:32:44,591
My son wants to be a hero, but I am a coward.

266
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:01,791
The old man is feeling uneasy and won't help undo Lu Ping's lock either.

267
00:33:01,791 --> 00:33:06,671
In this case, how can I tell him that Qin Sang has been poisoned with cold toxin?

268
00:33:06,671 --> 00:33:09,860
If the boss rushes out of the valley and something happens,

269
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:12,431
Su Tang will definitely beat me to death.

270
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,071
Why would I beat you?

271
00:33:16,071 --> 00:33:20,280
Master, I am just here to entertain you.

272
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:25,551
You can beat me whenever you want. Don't worry about me. Oh right! How is the boss doing?

273
00:33:25,551 --> 00:33:30,139
I asked him to get some rest, but he is still feeling restless.

274
00:33:30,139 --> 00:33:34,560
How about I write to Miss Qin and ask her to come here to accompany Lu Ping?

275
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,100
Master, don't.

276
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:41,560
Mo Lin, what exactly are you hiding?

277
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:44,671
Don't think that just because this is your home I dare not beat you.

278
00:33:44,671 --> 00:33:50,060
Master, here is the thing. I have a friend who is very sick,

279
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:54,179
but she doesn't want to be a burden to others so she asked me to hide the secret.

280
00:33:54,179 --> 00:33:57,231
If you were me, would you agree?

281
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:03,819
Aren't your friends just us? Who is sick?

282
00:34:03,819 --> 00:34:07,811
Mo Lin, are you hiding something from me?

283
00:34:07,811 --> 00:34:12,619
By the way, Master, you haven't answered me yet. I asked before if you would be my wife.

284
00:34:12,619 --> 00:34:18,439
Didn't you say you'd answer me after we rescued the boss? Now, it's time for you to live up to your promise.

285
00:34:18,439 --> 00:34:21,760
I… Let's wait until my brother undoes the Pneuma Confinement before discussing this.

286
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,609
Master, you are someone's master. You should keep your word.

287
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:31,079
It's late. I have to go back and take care of my brother.

288
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:35,540
Master, take care of the boss.

289
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,390
I will figure out everything else.

290
00:34:37,390 --> 00:34:42,190
Don't forget. I am not only your disciple but also a man of his word.

291
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:00,699
Young Master, these are the best medicines in the valley to treat cold toxin.

292
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:05,399
It's still not enough. Go and get more around the area; the more, the better.

293
00:35:05,399 --> 00:35:10,199
When the time comes, even if I can't cure the cold toxin, it'll be good to buy some time for her.

294
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:13,900
When Lu Ping undoes his lock, at that time,

295
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:16,220
how can we not find a way to cure the cold toxin?

296
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:20,219
Who exactly has the cold toxin? Young Master, what are you talking about?

297
00:35:20,219 --> 00:35:24,799
Why are we talking like this?! No one is here! We—

298
00:35:24,799 --> 00:35:26,511
Just in case.

299
00:35:26,511 --> 00:35:32,051
You can't tell anyone about this, including my father.

300
00:35:32,051 --> 00:35:35,971
If you dare to say a word, I will poison you and make you mute right now.

301
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,971
I will do whatever you ask me to do.

302
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:47,491
You're good. You're much better than my two brothers.

303
00:35:47,491 --> 00:35:52,771
They are not obedient at all. What would they do without me?

304
00:35:52,771 --> 00:35:54,939
Yes. What would they do?

305
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,319
That Liu Song!

306
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:05,311
Your Majesty, calm down. They are just using evil means.

307
00:36:05,311 --> 00:36:09,139
Your Majesty has the power of the dragons. There's no need to fear.

308
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:14,951
When two armies battle on the battlefield, does that depend on the power of the dragons?

309
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:19,771
It depends on the soldiers and weapons.

310
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:25,519
Using five Pneumas is the strength of an expert like Yan Qiuci.

311
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,471
If these experts gather to form an army,

312
00:36:28,471 --> 00:36:31,551
ordinary soldiers won't be able to stop them.

313
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,700
Your Majesty,

314
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:41,219
in my opinion, it's not a bad thing that General Wen has discovered the secret of the Mountain and Sea Gang.

315
00:36:41,219 --> 00:36:44,211
Lu Ping is now under our control.

316
00:36:44,211 --> 00:36:48,531
Why not treat them how we're being treated?

317
00:36:48,531 --> 00:36:51,531
Lu Ping is the Awakener who can use six Pneumas.

318
00:36:51,531 --> 00:36:56,011
With his help, we don't need to fear the Mountain and Sea Gang.

319
00:36:56,011 --> 00:36:59,179
It's an emergency. I hope Your Majesty will make a decision.

320
00:36:59,179 --> 00:37:02,691
Lu Ping must not fall into the hands of others.

321
00:37:02,691 --> 00:37:06,171
Give my orders to Wen Rui and Yan Xifan.

322
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:10,151
They must bring Lu Ping to me.

323
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:14,731
Don't let him fall into the hands of the Mountain and Sea Gang.

324
00:37:14,731 --> 00:37:17,371
I will obey your order.

325
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:27,859
Xifan, I've asked the military physicians to do their best, but the master of the Phoenix Ridge Gang had already stopped breathing.

326
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:37,079
Xifan, don't be like this. You've done your best.

327
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:41,839
In order to create Pneuma Soul Eaters, the Mountain and Sea Gang disregards everyone elses lives.

328
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:45,200
If they succeed, Dan State will take this opportunity to invade the south.

329
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,010
Who knows how many civilians will suffer.

330
00:37:48,011 --> 00:37:51,380
You can't deal with them all by yourself.

331
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:53,931
You should ask Lu Ping for help.

332
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:58,959
He has been tormented for so many years. Right now, he can relax at Carefree Valley.

333
00:37:58,959 --> 00:38:02,520
Ziyan, let him live his life in peace.

334
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,971
General Wen, do we need to leave now?

335
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,670
Young Hero Yan, there is an edict from His Majesty,

336
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:16,851
ordering you to go to Carefree Valley and to bring Lu Ping back with you.

337
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,630
His Majesty wants to deal with the Pneuma Soul Eaters?

338
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:27,070
He can just get the Agile Dragon Army back to train. What does he want with Lu Ping?

339
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:31,200
Soldiers only need to listen to orders. They do not need to ask questions.

340
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:35,739
His Majesty knows that Lu Ping doesn't want to be an official. He usually wouldn't bother him.

341
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,600
Is His Majesty going to follow the Xi Sui of the Mountain and Sea Gang?

342
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:42,100
His Majesty also said Wuji Manor deceived the emperor.

343
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:45,899
According to the law, your whole family should have been beheaded, but His Majesty was merciful.

344
00:38:45,899 --> 00:38:50,111
He saw that you were young and talented so he didn't hold your family accountable.

345
00:38:50,111 --> 00:38:54,851
You better not act on impulse and disappoint His Majesty.

346
00:38:54,851 --> 00:38:57,919
Is His Majesty going to use Wuji Manor as a hostage?

347
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,399
Xifan, I beg you.

348
00:39:01,399 --> 00:39:04,960
That day, we all witnessed the power of the master of Phoenix Ridge Gang.

349
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:09,079
If we don't do something, when the brothers of Agile Dragon Army are in battle one day,

350
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:12,491
we will only be slaughtered. They are also human.

351
00:39:12,491 --> 00:39:16,659
They are brothers who had accompanied you to the Mountain and Sea Gang to save Lu Ping.

352
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:20,071
Can you bear watching them die?

353
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:31,971
I will obey the order.

354
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,251
Miss Ling, please wait.

355
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:45,240
His Majesty has a second secret edict. It is for you.

356
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:04,060
Xifan, are you really going to Carefree Valley to bring Lu Ping back?

357
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:08,599
Mo Lin was afraid we would get separated that day outside of the Mountain and Sea Gang so he gave me a map.

358
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:12,659
If Liu Song really uses Lu Ping to create the Pneuma Soul Eaters who can use six Pneumas,

359
00:40:12,659 --> 00:40:17,560
the situation will be even more difficult to deal with. I can only bring Lu Ping back to Kaifeng first.

360
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,360
Then try my best to persuade His Majesty.

361
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:24,351
But Lu Ping has a deep blood feud with His Majesty. What if he won't come back with you?

362
00:40:24,351 --> 00:40:26,460
Will you go against the edict for his sake?

363
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:29,311
I can only try my best to balance both.

364
00:40:29,311 --> 00:40:31,891
Take a rest. I am going to check on the horses.

365
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:49,799
Lu Ping must not fall into the hands of the Mountain and Sea Gang. You must bring him back.

366
00:40:49,799 --> 00:40:52,831
If he resists, get rid of him.

367
00:40:52,831 --> 00:40:57,171
If Yan Xifan is soft with Lu Ping, you can help him finish the task.

368
00:40:57,171 --> 00:41:01,011
Otherwise, I won't spare Yan Xifan's life.

369
00:41:01,011 --> 00:41:05,540
Xifan, I definitely won't let you commit the crime of betraying the emperor.

370
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:08,251
I can only hope this will be resolved smoothly.

371
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:20,151
Master Mo, why did you bring me here? To enjoy the flowers?

372
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,479
You can recuperate at Carefree Valley,

373
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,039
but you can't eat and drink for free. You have to work.

374
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:31,551
Water and plant the flowers.

375
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:45,920
I remember when I was young, there was a flower field in my hometown,

376
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,340
which was different from the scenery of Kaifeng.

377
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:55,600
Once I undo the Pneuma Confinement, I will go back to my hometown and plant flowers.

378
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:00,300
I will invite you to go with me then. How about it?

379
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,699
The countryside? What's so good about it?

380
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:07,110
Never mind then.

381
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:19,540
Brother, did you think of something?

382
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,380
Open your mouth.

383
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,679
I took it from Master Mo. Is it sweet?

384
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,331
Su Tang, did you realize?

385
00:42:37,331 --> 00:42:40,791
Here, I have you, flowers,

386
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:47,291
and the life I wanted when I was young. All of it is here in front of me.

387
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:49,860
Brother.

388
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:53,351
I have thought things through.

389
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,360
Instead of being used by Liu Song, it's better to be locked.

390
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:03,571
If I stay here in this isolated Carefree Valley,

391
00:43:03,571 --> 00:43:05,811
I can let everyone live in peace.

392
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:09,111
I can also live longer.

393
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,411
Why don't I stay then?

394
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:16,131
I have never

395
00:43:16,131 --> 00:43:19,871
lived a peaceful life before.

396
00:43:19,871 --> 00:43:24,111
Brother, then what about Miss Qin?

397
00:43:24,111 --> 00:43:26,291
Won't you look for her?

398
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:46,380
