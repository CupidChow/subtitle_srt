♫ The dark green sea is hazy ♫

3
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:32,800
♫ dissipating in a flash. ♫

4
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,570
♫ Rivers and lakes divide the world. ♫

5
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,900
♫ Ten thousands arrows are firing at once. ♫

6
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:43,940
♫ Who has time to worry? Who loves the color of blood? ♫

7
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:47,810
♫ At that time, spirits are high. ♫

8
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:51,630
♫ Who calls the world his home? Who dares let his horse freely run? ♫

9
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:54,360
♫ Silently, tears form in the death of night. ♫

10
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,250
♫ Heroes are cutting all ties, ♫

11
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:02,090
♫ giving up whether it's life or death, ♫

12
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:04,160
♫ never asking what the cost is. ♫

13
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:09,810
♫ Good and evil must be distinguished. ♫

14
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,700
♫ The wind blows off the snow. ♫

15
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,630
♫ On the body, etch multiple scars, ♫

16
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:19,720
♫ wandering all over the world, ♫

17
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:25,170
♫ only wish to ask for answers from this world. ♫

18
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:29,200
♫ A teenager doesn't have to be a hero. ♫

19
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,070
♫ There is no need for flowers in the dream. ♫

20
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,240
♫ Destiny need not be afraid. ♫

21

29
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,360
Boss, he must have been poisoned a long time ago.

30
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,300
He was just holding it in and didn't tell anyone.

31
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:34,340
He must have exhausted himself when saving His Majesty.

32
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,980
Now, it is too late.

33
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:40,559
You must have some ways. I will get whatever you need.

34
00:02:40,559 --> 00:02:42,600
Don't bother!

35
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,280
We have already exposed ourselves.

36
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,700
We must leave the city before the curfew today.

37
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,860
There is no time.

38
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:57,380
This was given to me by Minister Xu.

39
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,200
You brat,

40
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:04,080
although I've always disliked you,

41
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,930
now, I can only entrust Sang'er,

42
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,500
His Majesty,

43
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,380
and this thing to you.

44
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,060
Come here!

45
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,660
Brother.

46
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,480
You have to remember.

47
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,950
After taking this,

48
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:32,720
you can't do whatever you want

49
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,510
and not think about the consequences anymore.

50
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:37,960
Understand?

51
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,600
I understand.

52
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,860
Whether it is His Majesty or Qin Sang,

53
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:49,660
I will do my best to protect them.

54
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,020
Okay.

55
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,100
You brat,

56
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,500
do you still remember

57
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,180
the thing you asked me about in Kaifeng?

58
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,980
Yes.

59
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:19,000
I agree,

60
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,640
However, you have to remember that

61
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:33,460
if you bully Sang'er, the whole Agile Dragon Army will not let you go.

62
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,540
Brother!

63
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,080
Brother.

64
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,200
Don't talk anymore!

65
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,240
I will listen to you.

66
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,280
I don't want anything.

67
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,380
I only want you to be alive.

68
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,200
Silly!

69
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,240
Since our parents passed away,

70
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,560
I have always had one a serious face

71
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:22,500
and always controlled you.

72
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,940
I always wanted to be a good brother to you.

73
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:30,840
I want to chat with you just like this.

74
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,280
I want you to grow up happily.

75
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,400
Let me bear everything for you.

76
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,400
I know I didn't do a very good job.

77
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,500
No, Brother.

78
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,520
You are the best brother in the whole world.

but also my younger sister.

With me here, you have to be happy.

Why would I blame you?

You should leave first.

I will not disgrace the sword of the Qin family.

I really didn't expect that you were this willing to be together with me.

Shut up!

00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,940
No one is allowed to leave here.

166
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,340
Yes.

167
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,899
After the curfew tonight, if they still stay in the city,

168
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:24,440
then I will kill them all.

169
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:52,740
Master Zhou, His Majesty is noble.

170
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,960
He doesn't need you to "escort" him.

171
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:59,300
He left? Trying to buy some time?

172
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,980
Don't overestimate your strength.

173
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:05,459
I keep noticing that you're always looking at my front teeth. So creepy!

174
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:08,140
Why don't we put an end to this today?

175
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,200
Xifan.

176
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,730
[Yuezhou]

177
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:29,419
I am guilty for coming to the rescue late. Please forgive me.

178
00:15:29,419 --> 00:15:31,580
You can all get up.

179
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,960
Qin Sang.

180
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,259
- Your Majesty.
- You bore the pain of losing your brother in order to escort me out of the city.

181
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:47,060
It's really hard for you. You really have the spirit of the Qin Family.

182
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:50,620
You are like your brother in some ways.

183
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,460
Your Majesty has been too generous with your praise.

184
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:56,090
I am no match for my brother.

185
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,110
Now, for this important task,

186
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:01,420
I will shoulder it.

187
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:08,539
Your Majesty, it's dangerous now.

188
00:16:08,539 --> 00:16:10,770
The Agile Dragon Army has set camp on the border.

189
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:13,250
I will escort you there.

190
00:16:13,259 --> 00:16:16,340
No way! My boss and Eldest Senior are still in the city now.

191
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:20,100
- We can't just leave them.
- Also, the curfew will be in an hour.

192
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:24,599
If my brother and Eldest Senior Brother doesn't make it out in time, then they'll be in grave danger.

193
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:32,319
Your Majesty, Lu Ping and Xifan covered your retreating.

194
00:16:32,319 --> 00:16:34,460
If we left them,

195
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,120
I'm afraid it will dishearten the soldiers.

196
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,600
Lu Ping said he will come. He will definitely make it.

197
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,760
However, Your Majesty, this area isn't part of our country.

198
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,540
The longer we stay here, the more danger we'll be in.

199
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:53,320
It's only one hour. Let's wait!

200
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:16,400
I've heard that suffocation is the worst way to die.

201
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:21,360
Today, I want to see how you die.

202
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,900
I can only entrust Sang'er and His Majesty

203
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,420
to you.

204
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,460
You will return safely, won't you?

205
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:48,980
Outside Yuezhou, be there or be square.

206
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:56,560
It's not time yet. I can't die just like this.

207
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,640
If I can break one more chain,

208
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,440
I will use the four pneumas against Zhou Youlong.

209
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,940
Four pneumas breakthrough?

210
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,940
How did you do that?

211
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,690
Zhou Youlong,

212
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,440
you killed my master

213
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,420
and also General Qin.

214
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:11,380
This grievance, I, Lu Ping, want an eye for an eye.

215
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,160
I have avenged them.

216
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:26,550
[Yuezhou]

217
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:42,450
[Yuezhou]

218
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,180
Your Majesty, the gate is about to close.

219
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:49,680
I'm afraid Lu Ping and the others won't make it out of the city in time.

220
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,779
No. They can't close the gate. My brother is still in there.

221
00:19:55,779 --> 00:19:57,260
Master.

222
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,679
Let go!

223
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,580
Master.

224
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,360
Let go of me!

225
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,879
You can't go.

226
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,380
Let go!

227
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,860
Master.

228
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,719
Let go of me!

229
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,340
Master.

230
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,520
Lu Ping.

231
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:10,860
I said... I would make it here.

232
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:55,099
Liu Song found out our intentions. He will definitely harm Chu Min. Hurry up and find a way to open the door.

233
00:21:55,099 --> 00:21:57,579
I've warned Chu Min. There's no way to retreat.

234
00:21:57,579 --> 00:21:59,560
Right now, the door has been sealed by molten iron.

235
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,490
We can't open the door without godly weapons.

236
00:22:01,499 --> 00:22:04,320
Besides, you and I have been under the influence of Xi Sui.

237
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,360
Even with godly weapons, we would be useless.

238
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,480
Then lets hurry and push the Xi Sui substance out of our bodies.

239
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,139
Otherwise, once the Mountain and Sea Gang finds out that Liu Song is trapped, we'll be even more helpless.

240
00:22:12,139 --> 00:22:13,460
Okay.

241
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,179
I'm afraid Liu Song will notice if we go up the mountain with a huge crowd of people.

242
00:22:37,179 --> 00:22:39,500
You're worried about Miss Ling, aren't you?

243
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,479
We're familiar with the mountain so the two of us should go ahead and sneak in.

244
00:22:43,479 --> 00:22:45,700
Wen Rui and others can follow us.

245
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:50,420
Brother, are you leaving now?

246
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,770
The little assassin was hurt because of you.

247
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:02,880
You can't bear having him injured again because of you, can you?

248
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,780
Eldest Senior and I can take care of the Big Dipper.

249
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:08,300
You should accompany him back to the Carefree Valley to heal.

250
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:11,500
Relax for a bit as well, okay?

251
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,540
He's the one who was injured, not me.

252
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,400
Don't be stubborn!

253
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,780
Take care of my brother for me! It's my task for you.

254
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:23,060
Boss, don't worry!

255
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:25,420
Master will definitely take good care of me.

256
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,770
No need to say much between you and me.

257
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:34,250
I will escort His Majesty to Kaifeng.

258
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:40,000
I'll finish what my brother was not able to.

259
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,240
Very soon,

260
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,100
we will all be together again.

261
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,760
Eldest Senior,

262
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,940
let's go.

263
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,760
Who are you? Where's Yan Xifan? Speak!

264
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:58,460
He has already gone for a long while. Just don't take it out on us!

265
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,900
Tianqi.

266
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,920
It most likely has something to do with you talking nonsense that day.

267
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:09,840
It seems that if you don't suffer, you won't say anything.

268
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,660
Stop!

269
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:19,300
This has nothing to do with him.

270
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,530
I was the one who let Xifan go.

271
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,120
Ziyan.

272
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,680
You...

273
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:32,099
Tell me! Where is Yan Xifan?

274
00:25:32,099 --> 00:25:34,160
You'll never know.

275
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:38,380
What I hate most are pretty girls.

276
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,600
Does that hurt? It's just the first one.

277
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,720
Later, I will nail your hands and feet

278
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,960
and hang you on the wall.

279
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:55,240
You'll become a bloody hanging picture

280
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:59,970
for all of the Big Dipper to see. Doesn't that sound great?

281
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,660
Let her go!

282
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:22,040
We've taken over the Seven Peaks of the Big Dipper.

283
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,020
It's my turn to question you now.

284
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,580
Where is Liu Song?

285
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,320
Get out of the way!

286
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,300
Otherwise, I will kill her.

287
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,900
Miss Ling.

288
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:44,199
Seven Martyr Court, Liu Song is at the Seven Martyr Court.

289
00:26:44,199 --> 00:26:46,660
Xifan, take care of them.

290
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,700
- I will chase after them.
- Okay.

291
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,600
Miss Ling.

292
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,400
Everything is fine now.

293
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:04,599
Uncle Yan, Elder Guo, the Big Dipper has been saved.

294
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:06,479
Where are Liu Song and his gang?

295
00:27:06,479 --> 00:27:07,870
He is trapped inside with Chu Min.

296
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:11,150
Hurry! Otherwise, we won't be able to save Chu Min.

297
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,180
Master Chu Min!

298
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,720
They left a while ago. Liu Song is good, indeed.

299
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,579
He was able to find a secret path that I didn't even know about.

300
00:27:48,579 --> 00:27:50,990
Lu Ping, hurry and notify Pavilion Master Li.

301
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:53,440
Let him arrange disciples to chase after them.

302
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:02,400
The Zhai thief destroyed my country and disgraced my sect.

303
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,960
This hatred must be avenged.

304
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:09,420
If the Big Dipper is going to be used by the Zhai thief, then this sect is no longer for me.

305
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,020
- Welcome Chief.
- Welcome Chief.

306
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:42,559
The secret path has not been used for many years so we were a bit slow.

307
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:44,620
Sorry to keep you waiting.

308
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:47,780
I've never lost faith in Chief.

309
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:51,880
It's just that I received news that Zou Youlong had died in Yuezhou.

310
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,320
The Zhai thief is cunning.

311
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,980
He was able to escape.

312
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,620
That's okay.

313
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,460
I've got what I needed this time

314
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:08,360
so it wasn't a complete lost.

315
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,240
There will always be another chance to deal with the Zhai thief.

316
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:17,019
The secret path in Seven Martyr Court was built back in the day by Junior Shenfeng and me

317
00:29:17,019 --> 00:29:20,339
when Guo Wushu wasn't at the Big Dipper yet, so how could he know about it?

318
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,420
After many years,

319
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:27,860
the disciples of Big Dipper are as arrogant as they were back then.

320
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,959
Chief, regarding Lu Ping,

321
00:29:33,959 --> 00:29:37,120
are we really going to just let him go?

322
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:42,920
He will become suspicious after reading the words I left behind.

323
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,020
We can just wait.

324
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,720
Chu Min,

325
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,400
don't you want to know what happened that year?

326
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,460
I will show you myself.

327
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,920
You're awake?

328
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,580
It really is you.

329
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,519
You really came back for me.

330
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:24,100
Didn't I promise you? All of the Mountain and Sea Gang have been chased away.

331
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,920
Master Guo Wushu personally checked on your injuries.

332
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:30,559
You lost too much blood but fortunately, it wasn't too serious

333
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,540
Easy.

334
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:43,059
Young Hero Xifan, I was really scared during that time.

335
00:30:43,059 --> 00:30:45,620
I was afraid that I would die just like that.

336
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:50,780
Why did you rush out to protect everyone if you were so scared?

337
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,600
I will ask Miss Tang to take care of you.

338
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,140
Young Hero Xifan,

339
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:02,720
I have some words I haven't said to you yet.

340
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:08,320
I am really happy to be alive and be able to see you again.

341
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,020
Me, too.

342
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:32,150
[The Zhai thief destroyed my country and disgraced my sect. This hatred must be avenged. If the Big Dipper is going to be used by the Zhai thief, then this sect is no longer for me.]

343
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:36,160
The Zhai thief destroyed my country and disgraced my sect.

344
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,580
Why did Liu Song mention His Majesty?

345
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:43,060
What does this have to do with him?

346
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,499
What's the point at looking at these nonsensical words?

347
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:51,039
Master is so angry with Liu Song that he has not eaten for several days.

348
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:53,220
We can't find Master Chu Min, either.

349
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:58,340
If Master doesn't pull himself together soon, who will the Big Dipper rely on?

350
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:02,580
Aren't you most afraid of Master Chu Min? You're so worried about her this time.

351
00:32:03,199 --> 00:32:06,460
The Mountain and Sea Gang is our common enemy. What's the point in being so clearcut about everything?

352
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,880
Wei Tianqi,

353
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,980
before, you were just a spoiled young master in the Chan State.

354
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:18,240
Now, you are a real man.

355
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:22,060
I owe you one this time.

356
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,079
You are the same. Didn't you save His Majesty?

357
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:29,550
Oh right! His Majesty will be coming to the Big Dipper today.

358
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:31,470
Maybe he will reward you.

359
00:32:31,479 --> 00:32:33,380
His Majesty is coming.

360
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:39,980
[The Zhai thief destroyed my country and disgraced my sect. This hatred must be avenged. If the Big Dipper is going to be used by the Zhai thief, then this sect is no longer for me.]

361
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,440
Your Majesty.

362
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:56,340
Liu Song is so savage and this time,

363
00:32:56,340 --> 00:33:00,260
the Mountain and Sea Gang plotted against the puglist world as well as the court.

364
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:04,540
If you and I don't work together,

365
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:06,960
the world will be in chaos.

366
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,760
I'm ashamed.

367
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:15,500
The Mountain and Sea Gang wouldn't have been able to take advantage of us if I knew about it earlier.

368
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,150
I'll put down my prejudices. Let's eliminate the Mountain and Sea Gang together

369
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:19,430
Let's eliminate the Mountain and Sea Gang together

370
00:33:19,439 --> 00:33:22,780
and save Senior Chu Min.

371
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:27,020
That's great! It's still not too late.

372
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:29,740
Being able to receive Pavilion Master Li's words today,

373
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:32,020
I thank you on behalf of all the people.

374
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:33,440
You're welcome.

375
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,280
The casualties in the Big Dipper are not too serious.

376
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:45,520
It's just Liu Song did everything he could in order to steal the Thousand Pine Ruler from the Seven Martyr Court.

377
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:49,780
I've thought about it over and over again. I don't think it's that simple.

378
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:55,340
You're saying that Liu Song stole the Thousand Pine Ruler?

379
00:33:55,340 --> 00:34:00,019
Your Majesty, the Thousand Pine Ruler was Liu Song's old sword.

380
00:34:00,019 --> 00:34:03,420
I might as well tell you all.

381
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:08,340
There's only one reason why Liu Song did everything he could to steal the Thousand Pine Ruler.

382
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:16,200
It's because, hidden inside the sword, there is a commander's seal left by the Liu Family.

383
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:23,230
He wants to use this to build up the army and start a war.

384
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:31,100
No wonder he didn't hesitate to trade the Big Dipper for it.

385
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:34,730
He is really ruthless and deserves to die!

386
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:37,860
Senior Yan, Your Majesty,

387
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:42,279
please do not worry. Liu Song couldn't get the commander's seal.

388
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:49,940
I've heard from Peak Master Lu that

389
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:54,399
he added a secret lock to the Thousand Pine Ruler under the order of Pavilion Master Leng.

390
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:57,540
I think he wanted to lock the commander's seal.

391
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:01,040
In this world, no one but he can unlock it.

392
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,599
After the death of Pavilion Master Leng, he's been wandering around the world.

393
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,220
No one knows where he is

394
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:09,380
so even if Liu Song got the Thousand Pine Ruler,

395
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:12,060
he can't get the commander's seal.

396
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,200
I didn't expect this.

397
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:23,599
Yes. I didn't understand Master Leng's reasoning back then.

398
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:28,040
Now that I think about it, I'm afraid that Pavilion Master Leng knew long ago that something was not right about Liu Song

399
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:31,680
so he set up a backup plan.

400
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:36,939
Pavilion Master Leng is really thoughtful. I'm really ashamed of myself.

401
00:35:36,939 --> 00:35:39,040
I could never be compared to him.

402
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,340
Your Majesty, don't worry!

403
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:05,960
I didn't expect that the Big Dipper had long been guarded against Liu Song.

404
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,720
Now all things are settled.

405
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,200
There should be no more trouble.

406
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:15,180
It's rare that Manor Master Yan can be so confident.

407
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:20,340
The fact that Liu Song was able to attack the Big Dipper and steal the Thousand Pine Ruler,

408
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:24,180
is it because you've been a Master in the martial arts circles for too long?

409
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:27,200
You're too well-supported and pampered.

410
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,179
You've lost the spirit from back then.

411
00:36:29,179 --> 00:36:32,180
Your Majesty doesn't have to worry too much about these temporary failures.

412
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:34,399
The Wuji Manor is still powerful.

413
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,119
I will go back immediately and plan everything.

414
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,680
I won't let Liu Song win.

415
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,680
I hope you can keep your promise.

416
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:50,160
Please protect your integrity well.

417
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:54,320
Your Majesty, please wait for my good news.

418
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,880
It turns out that Father already knew His Majesty from before.

419
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,780
Why would you say that?

420
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,319
I came to find you earlier.

421
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,319
I saw you talking with His Majesty so I didn't want to disturb you.

422
00:37:33,319 --> 00:37:35,800
It seems that you and His Majesty were arguing.

423
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,939
You two looked familiar with each other and didn't look like you two just met for the first time

424
00:37:37,939 --> 00:37:39,840
so I was confused.

425
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:43,880
Wuji Manor is located in Jin City.

426
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,460
It's inevitable that we have to deal with the court.

427
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:48,880
We don't know each other very well,

428
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:53,859
However, in the future, the pugilist world and the court will fight against the Mountain and Sea Gang together.

429
00:37:53,859 --> 00:37:56,580
As a leader in the martial arts circle,

430
00:37:56,580 --> 00:38:00,180
I need to maintain a good relationship with the court.

431
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:04,299
You also go and get prepared as well. It's time we return to the Wuji Manor.

432
00:38:04,299 --> 00:38:08,299
We need to make some arrangements in order to guard against Liu Song's next steps.

433
00:38:08,299 --> 00:38:09,940
Yes.

434
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:15,480
I still have one more request.

435
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:18,740
In order to protect me, Miss Ling was tortured by the Mountain and Sea Gang.

436
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:21,920
She had a hard life so I can't bear to see her suffering.

437
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,680
I hope we can give her shelter in the Wuji Manor.

438
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,819
She does deserve recognition this time.

439
00:38:29,819 --> 00:38:33,440
Wuji Manor can take care of an orphan girl.

440
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,000
She'll rely on you from now on.

441
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,720
Thank you, Father.

442
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:45,560
Your Majesty, she's here.

443
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:49,480
Lift your head up and answer me.

444
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:58,720
In Yuezhou,

445
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:03,340
were you the one that Xifan rushed back to save at the Big Dipper?

446
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,800
I was terrified.

447
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:10,300
It's my blessing to win the favor of Young Hero Xifan.

448
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,720
You are lucky.

449
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,019
You didn't die under Qin Qi's arrow.

450
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:18,000
You even won the favor of Yan Xifan.

451
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,600
Did you know that the Yan Family is the noble family in the martial arts world?

452
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:27,400
No matter how much Yan Xifan likes you,

453
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,680
your status doesn't match his.

454
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,200
I don't understand what you are saying, Your Majesty.

455
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,480
It all depends on your effort.

456
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,420
Actually, you can change your status.

457
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:44,500
I need to know the movements in the Wuji Manor.

458
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:47,680
You are the best candidate.

459
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:52,960
You can stay with Yan Xifan and tell me the movements of the Yan Family.

460
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,760
I... will grant you a proper status

461
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:00,720
and guarantee you and Yan Xifan will have a happy ending.

462
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:07,640
Think about it!

463
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,359
- Wen Rui.
- Let's go.

464
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:57,720
I think you all know that

465
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:02,020
the Chief has always been behind the scenes for the overall situation.

466
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:05,780
I have acted on behalf of the Chief for many years.

467
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:07,779
Now the overall situation has been determined.

468
00:41:07,779 --> 00:41:11,300
There's no need to hide the identity of our Chief anymore

469
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:13,900
I will be returning the position of Leader of Forest Division.

470
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:19,480
Let's welcome our chief back together.

471
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:32,059
Welcome back, Chief.

472
00:41:32,059 --> 00:41:35,680
Welcome back, Chief.

473
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:39,800
Welcome back. Chief.

474
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:11,560
Chief, congratulations.

475
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:16,660
I have been waiting for the day you expose yourself and regain power

476
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:19,160
for a very long time.

477
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,040
It's just a formality.

478
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:24,839
Teacher, have you settled Chu Min down well?

479
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:28,460
I have settled down her well.

480
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:30,059
She hasn't woken up yet.

481
00:42:30,059 --> 00:42:34,860
I will definitely have someone inform you when she wakes up.

482
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,800
Thank you, teacher.

485
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:27,740
♫ Waiting to be buried by the lake in the town, ♫

486
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:33,900
♫ the White Paper Boat drifting with sorrow. ♫

487
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:39,690
♫ Lights on the other side of the sea ♫

488
00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:48,200
♫ punched fingertips in the red water tower. ♫

489
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:57,760
♫ Watch the little boat churning, laughing at the ordinariness. ♫

490
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,030
♫ Like a kite being pulled into a low altitude, ♫

491
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:07,430
♫ I smiled to the leaving person. ♫

492
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:11,760
♫ The more spotlight, the more vivid the story. ♫

493
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:16,830
♫ Laughing like the moon, ♫

494
00:44:16,830 --> 00:44:21,220
♫ regretting the lighthouse broke in the waves, ♫

495
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:28,680
♫ I call the Milky Way that isolates us all, blue. ♫

496
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:35,930
♫ Like a moat built under the sea, ♫

497
00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:40,780
♫ waiting for the words on the paper boat to disappear, ♫

498
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:48,730
♫ there must always be someone who doesn’t remember listening to the other. ♫

499
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:55,420
♫ Anyone who is correctly guessed will end in disfavor. ♫

500
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:59,570
♫ You are particularly touched but others consider it ordinary. ♫

501
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:04,850
♫ Like the author, roughly put down with a weak stroke, ♫

502
00:45:04,850 --> 00:45:09,340
♫ the writing boat on the lake was just like a paper crane in the air. ♫

503
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:14,160
♫ Laughing like the moon, ♫

504
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:18,890
♫ regretting the lighthouse broke in the waves, ♫

505
00:45:18,890 --> 00:45:27,240
♫ I call the Milky Way that isolates us all, blue. ♫

506
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:33,800
♫ Can a moat be built on the seabed? ♫

507
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:38,140
♫ Wipe all the words on the paper boat! ♫

508
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:45,540
♫ Please let someone not remember and don't tell another! ♫

509
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:52,610
♫ Hide the reluctance between words ♫

510
00:45:52,610 --> 00:45:57,310
♫ Unfortunately, I (you) are an average author ♫

511
00:45:57,310 --> 00:46:05,320
♫ No matter how you (I) describe the rest, it's unnecessary! ♫

512
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:15,760
♫ Don't describe my unfulfilled promise! ♫

513
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:24,550
♫ Don't interpret my hidden fire-smoke! ♫

514
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:33,470
♫ Don't let the paper boat in the rough wave chasing me! ♫

515
00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:42,090
♫ Don't wait until it's over to know there are you and me! ♫
