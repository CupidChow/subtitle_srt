♫ The dark green sea is hazy ♫

3
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:32,800
♫ dissipating in a flash. ♫

4
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,680
♫ Rivers and lakes divide the world. ♫

5
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,990
♫ Ten thousands arrows are firing at once. ♫

6
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:43,900
♫ Who has time to worry? Who loves the color of blood? ♫

7
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:47,780
♫ At that time, spirits are high. ♫

8
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:51,700
♫ Who calls the world his home? Who dares let his horse freely run? ♫

9
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:54,340
♫ Silently, tears form in the death of night. ♫

10
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:58,230
♫ Heroes are cutting all ties, ♫

11
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,100
♫ giving up whether it's life or death, ♫

12
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,250
♫ never asking what the cost is. ♫

13
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:09,820
♫ Good and evil must be distinguished. ♫

14
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,700
♫ The wind blows off the snow. ♫

15
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,570
♫ On the body, etch multiple scars, ♫

16
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:19,680
♫ wandering all over the world, ♫

17
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,300
♫ only wish to ask for answers from this world. ♫

18
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:29,230
♫ A teenager doesn't have to be a hero. ♫

19
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:33,110
♫ There is no need for flowers in the dream. ♫

Lu Ping!

30
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,811
Everyone, go back to the front hall. Hurry!

31
00:02:49,811 --> 00:02:52,799
Go! Hurry! Go!

32
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,839
Do you think that I wouldn't be able to recognize you with your face covered? Guo Youdao!

33
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,150
I knew it was you!

34
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,770
Master.

35
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,211
When did you realize?

36
00:03:42,211 --> 00:03:47,390
I have lived with you for three years, how could I not notice it was you?

37
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,551
Little fox! You've finally grown up.

38
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,719
You have hidden from me for three years, did you think it's funny?

39
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:03,140
Did you find it amusing to watch me search for you everywhere without saying anything?

40
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:06,940
Guo Youdao, who are you?

41
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,451
Do you know my parents? Why did you save me from the Mountain and Sea Gang?

42
00:04:12,451 --> 00:04:15,451
What did Wen Gecheng mean?

43
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,791
You're hurt.

44
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:29,611
It's nothing! Not a big deal.

45
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,471
Just who exactly are you?

46
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,220
After handling this situation, I'll take the time to tell you.

47
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:40,451
Right now, running for our lives is most important.

48
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,880
Run! To where?

49
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,660
Isn't this Master Guo who swore to surpass the Big Dipper?

50
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,519
Nice to meet you! Master! Master!

51
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:54,951
Why are you in such a mess now?

52
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,871
You come to visit without bringing gifts or wine?

53
00:05:02,871 --> 00:05:06,771
How rude you are, Leader Zhou!

54
00:05:06,771 --> 00:05:11,619
Shut up, old man! You may not win in a one-on-one fight.

55
00:05:11,619 --> 00:05:15,551
Let alone you've already lost one hand now.

56
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,591
Today, to be able to take one of the master's "teeth",

57
00:05:19,591 --> 00:05:23,311
it is my great honor!

58
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,851
Do you want to beat him up?

59
00:05:27,851 --> 00:05:28,960
Can we?

60
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,131
Can't you trust me just once?

61
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:35,011
Do you know why I always say "surpass Big Dipper"?

62
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,731
To defeat such a piece of garbage, I only need one hand.

63
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:11,171
"Disguise from God"! Old man, how dare you?

64
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:15,659
I will beat you as I please, why do you care which skill I use?

65
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,281
Master.

66
00:06:23,281 --> 00:06:25,840
I can see that you're just lightening up before death.

67
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,190
You won't survive!

68
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:46,499
Weren't you so impressive just now? Go on, continue!

69
00:06:46,499 --> 00:06:50,791
In the end, you're just a total loser.

70
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:53,930
However, I won't kill you today.

71
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:59,640
Because there are still a lot of interesting tortures waiting for you back at the gang.

72
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,611
Can we escape today?

73
00:07:02,611 --> 00:07:06,611
I would rather die than let you be captured again.

74
00:07:06,611 --> 00:07:09,791
It's much better! Let's go.

Don't press an enemy at bay!

82
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,440
Hero Yan, did you come here especially to help us?

83
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:06,191
My son has made trouble for you.

84
00:09:06,191 --> 00:09:08,691
I hope General Qin can be forgiving.

85
00:09:08,691 --> 00:09:12,271
So that's what's going on. Forgive me that I didn't recognize you.

86
00:09:12,271 --> 00:09:14,540
I always respect people from the pugilist world.

87
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:17,091
Since you, the Leader of Martial Arts came personally,

88
00:09:17,091 --> 00:09:20,311
I'll let them go on your behalf.

89

- Please.
- Please.

91

People without a level higher than four pneuma powers,

92
00:09:51,211 --> 00:09:55,671
will probably break their whole body if they fall from this height.

93

I have always said that no Wind Taker shall be left behind.

94

But I still couldn't keep my word.

95

96

An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.

97

I will send people to search for them.

98

There are still many things left for you to do.

99

I want to go back to Wind Taker Institute.

100

Don't bother! The Mountain and Sea Gang have already left.

Qin Qi won't make things difficult for them.

You can stop worrying about me from now on.

Aren't I clever?

149
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:56,551
That's why I'm called the "God of Bandits".

150
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:08,589
Look at you! So pitiful with your poor skills.

151
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:10,731
So I gave you some

I have to drink some wine to warm myself.

The cliff is so tall.

157
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,680
Did you take all of the impact

158
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:14,771
made by our falls onto yourself?

159
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,451
As I said,

160
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:27,931

Have a look!

327
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:26,380
Passersby, don't miss out!

328
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:32,691
Candied haws!

329
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:36,240
Guaranteed you'll be full!

330
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,220
Elder!

331
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:15,041
Okay, okay.

332
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,790
Although Old Guo changed your pulse condition with his Disguise from God,

333
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:29,760
your sword injury is not a small issue, either.

334
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,991
Just lie down!

335
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,441
I can never pay you back for

336
00:34:37,441 --> 00:34:39,691
what you and Elder Guo did for me.

337
00:34:41,051 --> 00:34:48,811
Old Guo said that you can only survive if you die before the eyes of the Qin's.

338
00:34:48,811 --> 00:34:50,539
You keep your life only by giving it.

339
00:34:50,539 --> 00:34:52,271
This is...

340
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,191
This is what he was good at.

341
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:03,631
Elder Guo is so skillful.

342
00:35:03,631 --> 00:35:08,231
With him around, Young Master Lu will surely be okay, won't he?

343
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:13,431
Skillful?

344
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,871
He was just a fool who didn't care about his own life.

345
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:28,219
Your Majesty, Sir Wen and I have both been court officials for numerous years.

346
00:35:28,219 --> 00:35:31,350
Although we quarrel from time to time,

347
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:34,170
we both are loyal to you.

348
00:35:34,171 --> 00:35:41,119
Who would've thought that Sir Wen would be killed by the champion whom Your Majesty chose.

349
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:47,751
The truth shows that the Pneuma Combat Convention was a disaster.

350
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:55,871
Commander of Agile Dragon Army, Qin Qi, has arrived for an audience!

351
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:04,759
Your Majesty, I have sinned.

352
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:09,039
What kind of sin has General Qin commited?

353
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:13,840
Your Majesty, I discovered that Lu Ping was from the Mountain and Sea Gang a long time ago.

354
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:18,451
I wanted to attract his associates and set a trap at the convention.

355
00:36:18,451 --> 00:36:22,719
Although we have badly hurt the gang and captured most

356
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:27,651
of the spies in the country, Sir Wen was killed by Lu Ping.

357
00:36:27,651 --> 00:36:32,579
Because I was afraid of information being leaked, I didn't report to Your Majesty beforehand.

358
00:36:32,579 --> 00:36:34,860
Please forgive me for lying due to the military tactics.

359
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,511
Please still punish me, Your Majesty!

360
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,799
You have killed numerous enemies on battlefield.

361
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:45,199
I never thought you could also surprise me by making up stories.

362
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:49,631
Do you have evidence for the things you're saying, Minister Xia?

363
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:54,139
I have evidence that I have captured the Mountain and Sea gang spies.

364
00:36:54,139 --> 00:36:59,399
If I lied, I am willing to resign from my position and accept punishment.

365
00:36:59,399 --> 00:37:05,391
What evidence can you show to prove your accusations against me?

366
00:37:05,391 --> 00:37:06,840
You...

367
00:37:09,351 --> 00:37:14,991
In fact, General Qin always cares about the country.

368
00:37:14,991 --> 00:37:18,811
Minister Xia should not be so severe.

369
00:37:18,811 --> 00:37:23,151
It is just that the implication is so big that we have to be low-key.

370
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:27,979
Your Majesty is generous! Thank you, Your Majesty.

371
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:29,640
- Your Majesty—
- Minister Xia,

372
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:33,040
I have military matters to discuss with General Qin.

373
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,071
You can leave first.

374
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,320
Yes.

375
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:50,571
What have you gotten after investigating the Mountain and Sea Gang for so long? Let's hear it!

376
00:37:50,571 --> 00:37:55,231
Your Majesty, I have investigated in many ways and only have a few leads.

377
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:59,319
I only knew that 19 years ago, the Mountain and Sea Gang went to Big Dipper to compete

378
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:01,931
and disappeared ever since.

379
00:38:01,931 --> 00:38:04,239
Now they suddenly appeared in the north.

380
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:08,019
There must be something going on, I will continue investigating.

381
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:09,591
No need!

382
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:14,951
There's no use caring about old things.

383
00:38:14,951 --> 00:38:18,151
I'm not afraid of the past Mountain and Sea Gang.

384
00:38:18,151 --> 00:38:22,131
Now, they not only hanker to covet the pugilist world,

385
00:38:22,131 --> 00:38:24,551
but they also want to control the court.

386
00:38:24,551 --> 00:38:26,690
Your Majesty means…

387
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:30,451
These past few days, I got news from Jin City.

388
00:38:30,451 --> 00:38:33,811
The Liu Clan from Hedong are making moves.

389
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:36,310
They have been in contact with Xidan.

390
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:38,320
Their ambition is very obvious.

391
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,471
Since the founding of the country,

392
00:38:41,471 --> 00:38:45,291
the Liu Clan has retreated to the north of Jin City

393
00:38:45,291 --> 00:38:49,639
but they never gave up on taking our land.

394
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:52,951
Many of the Mountain and Sea gang spies you have discovered

395
00:38:52,951 --> 00:38:56,311
are former residents of Dan State.

396
00:38:56,311 --> 00:38:59,471
If I say they are not related,

397
00:38:59,471 --> 00:39:03,171
would you believe it, General Qin?

398
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:10,939
If you put it this way, what the Mountain and Sea Gang did in the past seems ridiculous and disorderly

399
00:39:10,939 --> 00:39:14,511
but it actually benefits the Liu Clan.

400
00:39:14,511 --> 00:39:17,511
The Liu Clan must be the masters behind the gang.

401
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:21,719
Your Majesty is so clever, I am nowhere near you.

402
00:39:21,719 --> 00:39:25,659
That's why I order you to be careful.

403
00:39:25,659 --> 00:39:30,591
You must destroy them totally and strengthen the garrison at the border,

404
00:39:30,591 --> 00:39:34,811
in case they collude and invade us.

405
00:39:34,811 --> 00:39:40,371
For me, I'm thinking about cooperating with other neighboring states.

406
00:39:40,371 --> 00:39:42,911
I will send an ambassador to them soon.

407
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,951
These are utmost important.

408
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:51,811
I expect that you will take up the responsibility.

409
00:39:51,811 --> 00:39:55,411
I am willing to sacrifice my life for you.

410
00:39:55,411 --> 00:39:57,431
I won't disappoint you.

Lu Ping.

414
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:44,659
Young Master, you're finally awake.

415
00:40:44,659 --> 00:40:47,899
After you came back, you have not eaten or drunk anything, and completely passed out.

416
00:40:47,899 --> 00:40:50,399
How can your body endure such treatment?

417
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,919
I will go to fetch you something to eat.

418
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,880
Don't bother, Uncle Wei!

419
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:56,040
I'm fine.

420
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:15,519
Young Master, you've been away for more than four years without any news.

421
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:18,720
Have it not been for the disciples who discovered the jade you had pawned in time,

422
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,971
Master couldn't have made it in time to save you.

423
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,780
Where's my father?

424
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:28,439
There's something going on at the border of Jin City.

425
00:41:28,439 --> 00:41:31,691
Since he's been back, Master has been busy this whole time.

426
00:41:31,691 --> 00:41:34,451
He asked me to take care of you.

427
00:41:34,451 --> 00:41:39,359
He said that you don't have to think about the past since you have returned.

428
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,331
Sir, what can I do for you?

429
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:06,419
That guy came here just a few days ago.

430
00:42:06,419 --> 00:42:10,531
He fights only once a day but he has the highest odds.

431
00:42:10,531 --> 00:42:16,351
He seems to know all six pneuma powers but he uses no more than two at once in a fight.

432
00:42:16,351 --> 00:42:20,031
We ordinary people can only use one kind of pneuma power.

433
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:23,511
But he can perform a seamless transformation among the six.

434
00:42:23,511 --> 00:42:26,759
Except for the hardest, Pneuma of Essence, which he is not that good at,

435
00:42:26,759 --> 00:42:29,771
he can use the other five at a high level.

436
00:42:29,771 --> 00:42:33,159
Therefore, up until now, he has always won.

437
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:36,539
No matter if he fights against one person, a group of people, or even beasts, he hasn't lost yet.

438
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:40,691
What's his name?

439
00:42:40,691 --> 00:42:42,580
Lu Ping.

440
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:51,791
Good!

441
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:58,479
Fighting!

442
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:12,241
I just don't believe you're all that good!

443
