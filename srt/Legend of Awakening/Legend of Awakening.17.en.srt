00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,970
♫ The dark green sea is hazy ♫

3
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:32,830
♫ dissipating in a flash. ♫

4
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:36,500
♫ Rivers and lakes divide the world. ♫

5
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,970
♫ Ten thousands arrows are firing at once. ♫

6
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:43,940
♫ Who has time to worry? Who loves the color of blood? ♫

7
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:47,800
♫ At that time, spirits are high. ♫

8
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,640
♫ Who calls the world his home? Who dares let his horse freely run? ♫

9
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,370
♫ Silently, tears form in the death of night. ♫

10
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:58,200
♫ Heroes are cutting all ties, ♫

11
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,080
♫ giving up whether it's life or death, ♫

12
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,230
♫ never asking what the cost is. ♫

13
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:09,900
♫ Good and evil must be distinguished. ♫

14
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,770
♫ The wind blows off the snow. ♫

15
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:17,670
♫ On the body, etch multiple scars, ♫

16
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,800
♫ wandering all over the world, ♫

17
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:25,180
♫ only wish to ask for answers from this world. ♫

18
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:29,230
♫ A teenager doesn't have to be a hero. ♫

19
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:33,080
♫ There is no need for flowers in the dream. ♫

20
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,200
♫ Destiny need not be afraid. ♫

21
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,780
♫ Because you have him all the way, ♫

22
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:44,700
♫ experienced a handful of conquests, ♫

23
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,570
♫ overcame a number of challenges. ♫

24
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,640
♫ From now on, happy and free! ♫

25
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,300
♫ The only wish is, with the world, ♫

26
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:00,710
♫ would come along the willing of change. ♫

[Legend of Awakening]

28
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:22,870
[Episode 17]

29
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,780
That guy came here just a few days ago.

30
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:32,540
He fights only once a day but he has the highest odds.

31
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,140
What's his name?

32
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,360
Lu Ping.

33
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,600
I just don't believe you are all that good.

34
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:09,180
Someone told me that you can use all six pneumas.

35
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:14,840
Have you ever seen anyone like that would still come to the Fighting Hall once they acquire the six pneumas?

36
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,620
No!

37
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,059
You're right!

38
00:03:22,059 --> 00:03:24,760
I have seen through you.

39
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,540
You only have two pneumas.

40
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:31,380
Pneuma of Energy and Pneuma of Pivot.

41
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:36,100
Then it's very unfortunate for you, I excel at Pneuma of Strength.

42
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,260
You'll certainly be dead.

43
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,840
Good!

44
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,690
Beat him!

45
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,890
Fight!

46
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:43,140
- You looked down upon me! I can certainly use more than those two pneumas.
- Good!

47
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:46,680
Pneuma Confinement! It's indeed Lu Ping.

48
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,719
Such a big guy, he's a complete fool!

49
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,420
Pay back my money!

50
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,479
- Good!
- Well done!

51
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:08,799
Good!

52
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,279
Well done! Great!

53
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:16,650
[Wuji Manor]

54
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:23,799
Manor Master, the bandits who always intrudes the border have been killed by our men.

55
00:05:23,799 --> 00:05:26,840
People who have been captured by them are released.

56
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,420
Well done!

57
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:34,860
Get some money to give to those people for settling down.

58
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,140
Yes.

59
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:41,580
Manor Master, are you going to inform the army in Jin City?

60
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,960
You should be praised for what you did.

61
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,840
Jin City is near the border and very important for the country.

62
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,380
The army is busy every day.

63
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:55,720
Why bother praising ourselves for killing some bandits?
[Aze - Wuji Manor]

64
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,720
We learn martial arts to keep peace for the world and to protect our people.

65
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,040
This is what we should do.

66
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:07,000
When I was in Kaifeng, I heard about the chaos made by the Mountain and Sea Gang at the convention.

67
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,940
You should inform the masters of all sects in pugilist world to take extra precautions

68
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,280
in case the Mountain and Sea Gang make a sneak attack.

69
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,600
Yes.

70
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,480
You are awake.

71
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,620
I'm sorry, father! I came to apologize.

72
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:27,100
Since you have woken up, then have a walk with me.

73
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,120
Yes.

74
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,520
I heard that you did well at the convention

75
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,440
and even killed one leader of the Mountain and Sea Gang.

76
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:49,040
I haven't seen you in years and now, you have grown up and become mature.

77
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:53,900
For all these years, I left you living by yourself. I am sorry!

78
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:58,420
This is my responsibility and it will be yours, too, one day.

79
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,720
I didn't go to find you for all these years

80
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,120
because I hope you can solve your own problems.

81
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,519
Only this way, can you qualify yourself to be the son of Yan Qiuci, Wild Sword from the Northwest.

82
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,480
Back then, I happened to enter the Wind Taker Institute by chance and originally, wanted to give up on myself.

83
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:21,060
Surprisingly, I got a good master and made some good friends.

84
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,639
I did something that I had never thought of doing in my entire life.

85
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:27,520
I have gone through many difficulties which I hadn't been able to solve before.

86
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,780
Now, I have found the reason for me to use my sword again.

87
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:34,580
Father, I have come back.
(TN: it has a deeper meaning of his being back in the mental state as well)

88
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:42,820
In the past, I was worried that you were too upright

89
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:46,480
to live in the society.

90
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:51,860
But I never imagined that while I was not looking out for you, my son has indeed grown up.

91
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:56,059
However, I couldn't fulfill my promise to help Lu Ping.

92
00:07:56,059 --> 00:08:00,180
I will certainly help him to punish the Mountain and Sea Gang for

93
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,780
binding him with the Pneuma Confinement.

94
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,280
Good!

95
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,640
We are not only father and son but also allies in the future.

96
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,980
We should think carefully about fighting against the Mountain and Sea Gang.

97
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:17,399
You have not yet recovered completely, you still need to nurse back your health.

98
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:20,240
- Hurry back to rest!
- Yes.

99
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:31,220
[Wuji Manor]

100
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:40,320
[Wuji]

101
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:47,720
Manor Master, I have learned that

102
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,900
Guo Youdao was indeed the master of our Young Master.

103
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,540
Just as I thought, it was indeed my fourth junior.

104
00:08:55,540 --> 00:09:00,500
Everything that has happened until now is really our fate.

105
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,340
Manor Master, Young Lord Lu Ping, who is the friend of our Young Master,

106
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:07,090
indeed has the Pneuma Confinement.

107
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:09,659
Many people can prove that.

108
00:09:09,659 --> 00:09:12,120
It is not something normal.

109
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,470
Except for the Young Lord from that year—

110
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:21,499
He is already dead, it's too late to talk about it.

111
00:09:21,499 --> 00:09:25,179
Don't mention that again! You'll make Xifan sad.

112
00:09:25,179 --> 00:09:26,620
Yes.

113
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,180
[Wuji]

114
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:33,220
If I knew that Wind Taker Institute was built by him,

115
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:38,320
I would have come earlier instead of watching it to be destroyed.

116
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:44,420
Forget it! It can serve as another reason for us, Wuji Manor,

117
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:47,400
to fight against the Mountain and Sea Gang.

118
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,780
[Wuji]

119
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:56,920
Young Master, our men have gathered.

120
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,600
Some of us also protect in the outskirt.

121
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,259
You haven't recovered totally, it's still best if you rest for a bit.

122
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:08,280
Lately, I heard the Mountain and Sea Gang have come to Jin City.

123
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:12,840
I want to investigate more to see what they are plotting this time.

124
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,120
Report!

125
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:19,219
Young Master! About five li away, we found people from the Mountain and Sea Gang.
(TN: 1 li = 1/2 km = 1/3 mile)

126
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,879
What a coincidence! We actually bump into them.

127
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,319
Qin Qi is putting a great pressure on the Mountain and Sea Gang.

128
00:10:24,319 --> 00:10:27,580
They are hiding, it's not easy to find them.

129
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,839
I can't lose this chance! Tell our men to hide themselves.

130
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,939
- Aze, you come with me to have a look.
- Yes.

131
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,860
Let's go!

132
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:44,200
Leader, that guy in the Fighting Hall has the Pneuma Confinement.

133
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,579
- Pneuma Confinement?
- Yes, I have seen clearly with my eyes.

134
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:53,599
He didn't even hide his name, he called himself Lu Ping.

135
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:02,419
Lu Ping! I have been looking for you for so long and I have finally found you.

136
00:11:02,419 --> 00:11:04,119
Let's go to Jin City.

137
00:11:04,119 --> 00:11:05,720
- Yes.
- Yes.

138
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,960
Have you heard what they said?

139
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,360
It looks like they were saying Lu Ping is still alive.

140
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,840
Tell our men to follow me to Jin City.

141
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,380
Yes.

142
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,820
[Jin City]

143
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,940
Young Master, I have already asked about it.

144
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,660
This is an illegal Fighting Hall.

145
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:42,820
Lu Ping was here fighting in this illegal Fighting Hall.

146
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:45,800
Why did he expose himself?

147
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,459
I'll go to see the situation first.

148
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:52,919
Aze, you go and inform Jin City's army with our men.

149
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,840
If I don't come out in 30 minutes, you'll break down the door.

150
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,259
Yes.

151
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:44,160
In my life, what I hate the most are those who follow me just like this tail.

152
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,740
You've noticed me from the get-go already.

153
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:52,380
Wasn't he the champion of the convention, a disciple from the Wind Takers?

154
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,780
Ar-are you here to take revenge on me?

155
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,480
Or did you come here to die?

156
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:34,120
Lu Ping, you actually didn't die.

157
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,160
Eldest Senior, you always come at the wrong moment.

158
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:42,120
You did it deliberately!

159
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,360
Only when I am being captured by the Mountain and Sea Gang,

160
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,360
then I'll have the chance to take revenge.

161
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:50,360
Did you really think that two people, each has only two pneumas,

162
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,000
can defeat me who have four pneumas?

163
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,900
You both have nice teeth.

164
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,900
Then stay here together!

165
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,340

00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,420
What are you doing inside?

167
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:19,920
Only when I am being captured by the Mountain and Sea Gang, then I'll have the chance to take revenge.

168
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,420
Mountain Leader, let's go!

169
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,940
Take Lu Ping with us!

170
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,380
- Go!
- Retreat!

171
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:21,580
Lu Ping, are you okay?

172
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,240
Lu Ping.

173
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,940
Lu Ping!

174
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,800
Hurry! Hurry to go and find Young Master.

175
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,400
Quick!

176
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,960
Why do you, as a disciple of Wind Takers,

177
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,120
want to help us, the Mountain and Sea Gang?

178
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:51,420
Besides, you are a good friend of Lu Ping, aren't you?

179
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,620
We are just ordinary friends.

180
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,440
It's nothing!

181
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,500
I know that Lu Ping exposed himself

182
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,940
just to attract you, Mountain Leader.

183
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:04,620
So, I want to be one of you.

184
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,900
You said you want to be one of us?

185
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:10,460
You killed Wen Gecheng, the leader of Wind Division.

186
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:14,340
Based on what, should we believe you?

187
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,239
I have been learning martial arts since young.

188
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,360
I just wanted a chance to gain fame from it.

189
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,240
I didn't mind that the Wind Takers are so poor.

190
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,260
With many hardships, I won a place at the convention and finally gained fame.

191
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,580
But Qin Qi didn't care about the truth.

192
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:32,879
It was me who killed the enemy but he asked for my life to pay for that.

193
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,080
Lu Ping can tolerate such a thing but I can't.

194
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:40,140
I would rather choose a new leader than tolerate the insult.

195
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:43,900
Is that why you chose the Mountain and Sea Gang?

196
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:47,980
The gang dares to send spies to spy on Shuo Kingdom.

197
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:51,940
So I was thinking they must be plotting something big.

198
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,660
You are brave!

199
00:16:55,660 --> 00:17:00,830
I, the leader of the Fire Division, actually still need a capable person.

200
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,220
However, I have a requirement.

201
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,730
I'll do what you say.

202
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,970
That's easy to claim.

203
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:12,590
If you want to be one of us,

204
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:16,300
you must give your blood from the heart

205
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,720
to swear alliance.

206
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:25,600
All the people who dare to do this are like the brothers of mine, Zhou Youlong.

207
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,320
What do you think?

208
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,200
Dare you ?

Xifan!

210

Young Master Lu, you are finally awake. That's great!

211
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,420
Miss Ling,

how are you still alive?

213
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,300
Elder Guo saved me.

214
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,239
Master.

215
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,620
Elder Guo did not just saved my life,

216
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:36,360
but also asked Master Chu Min to take care of me and my wounds.

217
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,360
So, that's what happened!

218
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,350
- What about Xifan?
- He…

219
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:58,640
he went with the Mountain and Sea Gang.

220
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,679
You are lucky! Yan Xifan hurt you badly.

221
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,479
His sword was near your heart.

222
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,220
You almost died.

223
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,720
Only near my heart?

224
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,480
Xifan is good with swords.

225
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,039
How could there be such a thing?

226
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,820
What now? Are you also tired of living?

227
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,500
Not true!

228
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,760
Xifan didn't really want to kill me.

229
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,720
He stabbed me in front of the Mountain and Sea Gang's people

230
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,360
because he wanted to be a spy for me.

- Have you got any information of my brother?
- That…

235
00:19:56,619 --> 00:20:00,120
I went around the whole city already but till now, I haven't got any yet.

236
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,580
Then how can you still eat? You should go back out to search.

237
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:06,079
When we arrived at the Shining Sky Academy, Master Chu Min already wasn't there.

It's you who said that her and my brother's scent was heading towards Jin City.

Now, we also don't have Eldest Senior.

Master… We don't have him now, either.

241

My brother must be all alone.

It is raining heavily outside, even a dog can't smell anything.

Besides, can't you respect your master a bit more?

I look like a strong man.

In fact, I am really weak.

But we walked past here before.

Mo Lin, did you do it deliberately?

You just want to have me as your disciple by giving up on my brother, is that it?

No, I wasn't. Listen to me! I… I…

Seven peaks represent seven stars in the Big Dipper.

That's right!

you blame me for Lu Ping's situation.

00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:33,000
Master, I should have already caught Lu Ping originally,

381
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,250
but a woman called Chu Min hindered me.

382
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:38,310
She even brought people from the government.

383
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:41,520
I didn't want to make trouble so I came back.

384
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,759
Chu Min?

385
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:49,399
I did some investigation and found that the woman took Lu Ping to Big Dipper.

386
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:53,080
What if I take people to Big Dipper to kill them all?

387
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,680
You are overreaching yourself.

388
00:32:56,680 --> 00:33:01,660
Skilled people all gather in Big Dipper, how can you kill all of them?

389
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:03,639
We have lost the opportunity already.

390
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:07,179
What do you want, Chief? I am not giving in!

391
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,420
Now our big plan in Yuezhou is the most important one.

392
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:15,380
We can capture Lu Ping later.

393
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:19,999
You just go and prepare to head for Yuezhou to raise fund and make some arrangement for later.

394
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,800
Don't make any mistake this time!

395
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,300
All right.

396
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:30,739
Yuezhou is on the border between Shuo and Tan, what are they doing?

397
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,460
Chief, it's time!

398
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,280
What is Chief doing?

399
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:02,079
Chief is exercising at this time every day in his secret room, he never rests.

400
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:04,180
Why do you care about it?

00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:08,239
You have already got such a high position, yet you show great self-discipline.

402

What a great man, Leader! I admire you.

403
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:45,000
Lu Ping, only when you get into the gang, can you face the master

404
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,890
and get a chance to kill him with one move.

405
00:34:46,890 --> 00:34:49,669
However, the people here are good at hypnotization using the Pneuma of Essence.

406
00:34:49,669 --> 00:34:52,810
Back then, the Phoenix Ridge Gang was completely destroyed by this way.

407
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:59,220
Someone has to be the spy.

408
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:04,380
I will certainly get the truth of the Mountain and Sea Gang.

409
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:34,260
I'm already old.

410
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:38,160
I could only delay Qin Qi for two hours.

411
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,599
I can't be cool anymore!

412
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:46,880
Ten years ago, they couldn't even hope to leave Kaifeng.

413
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,239
Just listen to yourself! It's you who hid from Lu Ping and made him searching for you everywhere.

414
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:55,039
Now that you have gotten into trouble, you even tried to solve the problem for him. You...

415
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:59,600
What do you want exactly?

416
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:05,200
That brat! He is so upright.

417
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:09,960
I don't want him to be misled.

418
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:19,499
- Does it hurt again?
- Minmin, Minmin, Minmin! Hurt, hurt, hurt!

419
00:36:19,499 --> 00:36:21,760
It hurts so much!

420
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:28,160
Minmin, since I am about to leave,

421
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,960
can't you be a bit more tender to me?

422
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,120
Where are you going?

423
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:45,400
Neither Qin Qi nor the Mountain and Sea Gang would give up on Lu Ping.

424
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:51,280
I have to find a way to finish all these.

425

Old Guo!

426
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:13,220
What now? Can't bear to be apart from me?

427
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:20,120
I will leave Ziyan to you.

What's the use of keeping it?

447
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:48,480
Senior Sister!

448
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:58,160
Senior Sister, Big Dipper is declining through these past years.

449
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,999
I am only an ordinary man.

450
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,819
If it wasn't due to the accident at that time that had all the masters leaving,

451
00:39:03,819 --> 00:39:07,319
I wouldn't have had the qualifications to become the pavilion master of Big Dipper.

452
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,559
My capabilities are inferior to those of Pavilion Master Leng's.

453
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:14,120
I have to take care and tolerate disapproval from others

454
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:17,740
to keep the honor of the Big Dipper Academy.

455
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:20,650
Senior Sister, since you have come back to Big Dipper,

456
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:24,880
you can't turn your back on me again.

457
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:28,620
Li Yaotian.

458
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,939
You are older than me and have more gray hair than I.

459
00:39:32,939 --> 00:39:36,980
I think what you are lacking is not ability

460
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,880
but courage.

461
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,799
I can't help you with that! Don't bother me in the future.

462
00:39:42,799 --> 00:39:44,499
Senior Sister, I still have one more question.

463
00:39:44,499 --> 00:39:47,240
Hurry and say it! I'm super sleepy.

464
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,080
I heard from Miss Ling that

465
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:56,880
Lu Ping was... the disciple of Senior Guo Youdao,

466
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,200
and also the... wanted man of the Shuo Kingdom.

467
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:05,439
Is it right to take him up to Big Dipper in public?

468
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,440
Also, who is Lu Ping?

469
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:13,540
What's his relationship with you and Senior Guo?

470
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:17,479
You don't need to know about his life-origin nor his identity.

471
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:22,780
No matter what, this child must be safe and sound.

Yes.

473
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,980
Senior Sister, you must have forgotten.

Everything about Guo Youdao, I meant Senior Gou,

475
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:37,480
is all that Master of Kaiyang Peak would care about.

476
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:42,579
Sh*t! How could I forget all about that old man?

477
00:40:42,579 --> 00:40:45,080
Why didn't you say it earlier?

[Ending OST: "The Paper Boat"]
[by Zhiqian Xue — Singers: Zhiqian Xue and Kewei Yu]

481
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:23,720
♫ Waiting to be buried by the lake in the town, ♫

482
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:29,750
♫ the White Paper Boat drifting with sorrow. ♫

483
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:35,520
♫ Lights on the other side of the sea ♫

484
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:44,190
♫ punched fingertips in the red water tower. ♫

485
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:53,720
♫ Watch the little boat churning, laughing at the ordinariness. ♫

486
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:57,930
♫ Like a kite being pulled into a low altitude, ♫

487
00:42:57,930 --> 00:43:03,390
♫ I smiled to the leaving person. ♫

488
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:07,710
♫ The more spotlight, the more vivid the story. ♫

489
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:12,680
♫ Laughing like the moon, ♫

490
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:17,130
♫ regretting the lighthouse broke in the waves, ♫

491
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:24,860
♫ I call the Milky Way that isolates us all, blue. ♫

492
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:31,840
♫ Like a moat built under the sea, ♫

493
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:36,670
♫ waiting for the words on the paper boat to disappear, ♫

494
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:44,620
♫ there must always be someone who doesn’t remember listening to the other. ♫

495
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:51,330
♫ Anyone who is correctly guessed will end in disfavor. ♫

496
00:43:51,330 --> 00:43:55,480
♫ You are particularly touched but others consider it ordinary. ♫

497
00:43:55,480 --> 00:44:00,860
♫ Like the author, roughly put down with a weak stroke, ♫

498
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:05,230
♫ the writing boat on the lake was just like a paper crane in the air. ♫

499
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:10,030
♫ Laughing like the moon, ♫

500
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:14,750
♫ regretting the lighthouse broke in the waves, ♫

501
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:22,720
♫ I call the Milky Way that isolates us all, blue. ♫

502
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:29,700
♫ Can a moat be built on the seabed? ♫

503
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:34,130
♫ Wipe all the words on the paper boat! ♫

504
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:41,420
♫ Please let someone not remember and don't tell another! ♫

505
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:48,620
♫ Hide the reluctance between words ♫

506
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:53,170
♫ Unfortunately, I (you) are an average author ♫

507
00:44:53,170 --> 00:45:00,980
♫ No matter how you (I) describe the rest, it's unnecessary! ♫

508
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:11,630
♫ Don't describe my unfulfilled promise! ♫

509
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:20,550
♫ Don't interpret my hidden fire-smoke! ♫

510
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:29,420
♫ Don't let the paper boat in the rough wave chasing me! ♫

511
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:38,060
♫ Don't wait until it's over to know there are you and me! ♫
