00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,860
♫ The dark green sea is hazy ♫

3
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:32,700
♫ dissipating in a flash. ♫

4
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,520
♫ Rivers and lakes divide the world. ♫

5
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,880
♫ Ten thousands arrows are firing at once. ♫

6
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,970
♫ Who has time to worry? Who loves the color of blood? ♫

7
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:47,740
♫ At that time, spirits are high. ♫

8
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:51,590
♫ Who calls the world his home? Who dares let his horse freely run? ♫

9
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:54,340
♫ Silently, tears form in the death of night. ♫

10
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:58,180
♫ Heroes are cutting all ties, ♫

11
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:02,040
♫ giving up whether it's life or death, ♫

12
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,120
♫ never asking what the cost is. ♫

13
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:09,770
♫ Good and evil must be distinguished. ♫

14
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:13,660
♫ The wind blows off the snow. ♫

15
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:17,610
♫ On the body, etch multiple scars, ♫

16
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,640
♫ wandering all over the world, ♫

17
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:25,130
♫ only wish to ask for answers from this world. ♫

18
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:29,190
♫ A teenager doesn't have to be a hero. ♫

19
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:33,020
♫ There is no need for flowers in the dream. ♫

20
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:35,070
♫ Destiny need not be afraid. ♫

21
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:40,660
♫ Because you have him all the way, ♫

22
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:44,640
♫ experienced a handful of conquests, ♫

23
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,450
♫ overcame a number of challenges. ♫

24
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,570
♫ From now on, happy and free! ♫

25
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:56,230
♫ The only wish is, with the world, ♫

26
00:01:56,230 --> 00:02:00,650

29
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:36,739
Mo's Carefree Weed?

30
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:38,680
A weed?

31
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:42,869
This is an invaluable treasure, only one weed grows in a century!

32
00:02:42,869 --> 00:02:44,340
It's worth thousands, Master.

33
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,040
I've surely suffered a huge loss.

34
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,760
What did you just say?

35
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,679
This thing... is worth thousands?

36
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:00,900
I'm going to be rich this time.

37
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,700
Carefree Weed?

38
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,639
The Mo family?

39
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:11,440
Mo Lin?

40
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,599
Master, since the mistake has been made, he should make up for it.

41
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,500
I'll go...

42
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,339
I'll go and get Mo Lin to make up for his mistake.

43
00:03:20,339 --> 00:03:23,959
It's just that... strangers aren't allowed into the hall of Wind Taker Institute.

44
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:26,340
I'm not done yet.

45
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,838
In the next few days, I have to go to Chan State to borrow a martial arts tower.

46
00:03:29,838 --> 00:03:31,538
Wind Taker Institute will be in your care.

47
00:03:31,538 --> 00:03:36,179
As long as there's no trouble, I'll pretend as if nothing has happened.

48
00:03:36,179 --> 00:03:38,180
Thank you, Master.

00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,840
Mo's Carefree Weed?

50
00:04:05,839 --> 00:04:08,199
Kid, this...

51
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:10,738
I have a lot of gadgets in my bag.

52
00:04:10,738 --> 00:04:13,259
I'll exchange one of them for your bread. Okay?

53
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:17,579
You don't believe me? Big Brother will show you!

54
00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:21,618
Kid, come back!

55
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:26,659
Do you want a nice meal at Ruyu House?

56
00:04:27,739 --> 00:04:30,340
It depends on my mood.

57
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:44,219
This flavor... I can make do with it.

58
00:04:45,299 --> 00:04:46,839
Let's meet again if possible.

59
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:50,409
Your last name is Mo, so have you heard of the Mo family in Carefree Valley?

60
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:56,278
The Mo family is renowned for their knowledge in herbal medicine.

61
00:04:56,278 --> 00:04:59,319
It's said that they can revive a death to a living.

62
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:03,429
Centuries ago, to avoid getting into the disputes of the martial arts world,

63
00:05:03,429 --> 00:05:05,560
the entire Mo clan withdrew into Carefree Valley.

64
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,440
What is the Mo family of Carefree Valley? I don't know what you're talking about.

65
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,078
The chief of Carefree Valley, Mo Buliu, has a son.

66
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:13,999
He is about your age.

67
00:05:13,999 --> 00:05:16,758
The Mo family has a unique bloodline.

68
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:19,999
They are born without any Pneuma of Strength.

69
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:24,360
Young Lord Mo, does the chief know that you're wandering out here?

70
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,859
Enough, enough! Hats off to you.

71
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:30,398
So what if I'm from Carefree Valley? Mo Buliu is my father.

72
00:05:30,398 --> 00:05:33,518
A physician without the Pneuma of Strength and you want to be an assassin?

73
00:05:33,518 --> 00:05:37,039
Who said I can't have a dream because I don't have the Pneuma of Strength?

74
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,858
I don't want to be like my father.

75
00:05:38,858 --> 00:05:41,838
All they do is hiding in the valley and serving as physicians for life.

76
00:05:41,838 --> 00:05:47,199
One day, I'll be sure to wipe out all the villains in the world and become the best assassin.

77
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,638
- Since you have such an ambition, you must be righteous at heart.
- Of course!

78
00:05:51,638 --> 00:05:55,319
That's good! The physicians of Carefree Valley are extremely skilled.

79
00:05:55,319 --> 00:06:00,219
Now that Lu Ping is severely injured, come with me to Wind Taker Institute to attend to his wounds.

80
00:06:00,219 --> 00:06:05,439
Lu Ping? Even if I starve for three days and nights, I won't get involved with that jinx.

81
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm off.

82
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:20,730
- Su Tang.
- Judging by your personality, you won't leave my brother in the lurch.

83
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:22,838
Seeing what you just did, I was right after all.

84
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:24,438
My brother also didn't save you for nothing.

85
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:26,738
Aren't you afraid that I have an ulterior motive?

86
00:06:26,738 --> 00:06:29,580
My brother has always tackled his obstacles alone.

87
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,418
Apart from me, hardly anyone else had offered him any help.

88
00:06:32,418 --> 00:06:34,999
What's the harm in trusting you once?

89
00:06:34,999 --> 00:06:37,458
If this fellow can really save my brother, I'll take him back by force.

90
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:40,800
I'm not an object, don't use me to obtain favors.

91
00:06:47,619 --> 00:06:50,738
Your Pneuma of Strength! Are you already close to mastering it?

92
00:06:50,738 --> 00:06:52,920
Why are you so bossy?

93
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,998
Stop it! If you beat me senseless, no one can save your God-brother.

94
00:06:56,998 --> 00:06:59,200
So you've agreed to save him?

95
00:07:02,179 --> 00:07:04,978
I don't have the Pneuma of Strength.

96
00:07:04,978 --> 00:07:11,140
But... If I get to be attended by a disciple of the Pneuma of Strength, that seems quite nice as well!

97
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:14,178
Why don't you become my disciple?

98
00:07:14,178 --> 00:07:15,919
Make a living with me in the martial arts world.

99
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:20,340
As for saving him, I can give it some thought.

100
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:23,439
You want me to leave with you?

101
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:25,099
That's right.

102
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,978
It's awesome to be an assassin.

103
00:07:29,978 --> 00:07:32,518
A lot of people came begging me, but I turned them down.

104
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:34,600
Just reconsider it!

105
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:42,580
Zhao Xifan said that I'm the only one who can save your brother.

106
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:47,399
You either become my disciple or you are on your own.

107
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:50,910
- You really won't save him?
- I won't save him even if you grab me by force.

108
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:53,718
Fine! We, Wind Takers, don't force anyone.

109
00:07:53,718 --> 00:07:56,699
Let's go, Su Tang! We'll find someone better.

Master Guo, I can't be bothered to beat around the bush.

In regard to borrowing the martial arts tower, you can't!

Chief, how can you say that?

126
00:09:07,229 --> 00:09:11,679
We share years of friendship between our martial arts academies.

- Don't shoot your mouth off!
- Right!

It can't be called a martial arts academy.

Secondly, the martial arts tower was sponsored by the Wei family.

00:09:39,598 --> 00:09:42,499
It's built for the State Exam.

Besides, this year's exam will affect the Pneuma Combat Convention.

If the disciples of my academy get to win a place at the Pneuma Combat Convention,

they will serve the state as officials.

and yet you want to borrow the tower for the exam.

Master Guo, that's trying to curry favors empty-handed.

Isn't that a wishful thinking?

It's such a hot day! If you're tired, you don't have to come here to practice every day.

154
00:10:53,239 --> 00:10:56,819

- That's true!

00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,999
- How can I neglect my training?
- You're right!

157

Isn't this Master Guo of Wind Taker Institute?

Isn't this... Young Lord Wei?

159
00:11:08,539 --> 00:11:13,218
I've long heard that Young Lord Wei is the top disciple here in Chan State's academy.

160
00:11:13,218 --> 00:11:16,579
Having seen you today, you truly are charming.

You're the best of the best.

162

We've always been friendly.

164

- Exactly!

165
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:30,738
Disciples of both academies can learn from each other in the same tower.

166
00:11:30,738 --> 00:11:32,619
Good!

167
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,820
Since Young Lord Wei said so, I can surely lend it to you.

168
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:40,098
That's great! Thank you, Chief.

If this adds to his injuries, what am I to do?

176
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:03,678
That fellow's meridians must have been damaged by Situ Luo. His pneumatic power is obstructed.

177
00:12:03,678 --> 00:12:05,739
I'll need silver needles to get the flow going.

It's only for my disciple's sake that I'm helping him.

However, I've made two bad bargains already.

189
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:55,418
The Mo family of Carefree Valley are known for their medical expertise, he can surely cure you.

190
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,998
This is extraordinary... Absolutely extraordinary! This is the first time I've ever seen such a pulse.

191
00:13:13,998 --> 00:13:15,820
What kind of pulse?

192
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,540
"Eight extraordinary meridians induced six pneumas."

193
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:20,810
Most people start training martial arts by learning one pneuma.

194
00:13:20,818 --> 00:13:25,839
After training for decades, those who master three to four pneumas are considered outstanding martial artists.

195
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,538
I've read in medical books that there are rare geniuses born once in a century.

196
00:13:29,538 --> 00:13:31,870
They are born with the unity of six pneumas.

197
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:34,040
They are known as the Awakeners.

198
00:13:38,599 --> 00:13:41,000
What has this got to do with Lu Ping?

199
00:13:41,739 --> 00:13:44,099
He is born with the unity of six pneumas.

200
00:13:44,099 --> 00:13:47,820
However, someone forced confinement onto him, to seal off his meridians.

201
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,620
That suppressed his pneumatic powers.

202
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:54,659
If that is such a rare gift, why would his six pneumas be sealed?

203
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:57,440
What's the use of a gift that's sealed?

204
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,278
You've been talking all this time, do you know how to cure me?

00:14:00,278 --> 00:14:04,320
Well... I've always wanted to become an assassin since I was little.

206
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,939
As for my medical knowledge... It's only average.

Someone like you... still want me as your disciple?

208
00:14:11,499 --> 00:14:14,018
Just give me a bit more time and let me think it through.

209
00:14:14,018 --> 00:14:18,278
Besides, it's still better than having your brother sink into the lake and getting himself killed?

210
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:25,019
Hold on! Getting himself killed?

211
00:14:29,179 --> 00:14:31,698
Look! Look at his eyes!

212
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:04,160
I get it! His pneumatic powers are roused when he is in pain.

213
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,759
It's caused by the meridians' reaction to the aggravation.

214
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:10,259
That's why suffocation in the lake allows him to sneak out some of his pneumatic powers.

215
00:15:10,259 --> 00:15:13,999
He actually sneaks out his pneumatic powers at the verge of death?

216
00:15:13,999 --> 00:15:18,820
Now that the suffocation doesn't work, we'll have to amplify his pain by a thousandfold,

217
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,220
in order to rouse his meridians.

218
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:24,280
Are you going to torment him to death?

219
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,900
As long as I can get my pneumatic powers back,

220
00:15:28,339 --> 00:15:30,759
I'm willing to die as many times as needed.

221
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:41,139
All right! Right now, I'm going to use this bed of nails to seal off your seven extraordinary meridians.

00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,600
As long as we can follow Lu Ping into the tower,

308
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,440
we're one step closer to revealing the truth.

309
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,679
Miss, you won't be fooled by Lu Ping again, will you?

310
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,919
You keep talking about him.

311
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:07,139
I just think that everyone has his nemesis.

312
00:22:07,139 --> 00:22:11,660
Whenever you meet Lu Ping, it's as if you meet your nemesis.

313
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:14,699
Twice is enough! I'll make him see

314
00:22:14,699 --> 00:22:17,700
I will never be fooled by him three times.

315
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,120
Let's go!

316
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:39,900
This time, I went in person and managed to borrow the martial arts tower.

317
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,438
- That's great! We can take part in the state exam.
- Exactly!

318
00:22:42,438 --> 00:22:45,259
- We can finally take the exam.
- That's great!
- I've long wanted to take part in it.

319
00:22:45,259 --> 00:22:47,939
We won't let you down, Master.

320
00:22:47,939 --> 00:22:49,920
However,

321
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:54,020
in order to train you all on taking on obstacles on your own

322
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:56,490
and having the ability to resolve difficulties,

323
00:22:56,499 --> 00:23:01,500
I... won't go with you.

324
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,799
Why is that?

325
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,220
We even borrowed a training space from someone else.

326
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,399
What's the fuss about saving a bit of transport fees?

327
00:23:07,399 --> 00:23:10,719
What do you know? You're being too willful!

328
00:23:10,719 --> 00:23:16,400
This time, we must win at the Chan’s state exam.

329
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:21,319
Big Dipper Chamber and us, we've taken one big step towards them again!

330
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:27,218
The valiance of Wind Takers surpasses that of Big Dippers'!

331
00:23:27,218 --> 00:23:30,940
The valiance of Wind Takers surpasses that of Big Dippers'!

332
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:34,318
The valiance of Wind Takers surpasses that of Big Dippers'!

333
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:36,999
- The valiance of Wind Takers
- Eldest Senior.

334
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,719
surpasses that of Big Dippers'!

335
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,580
Why isn't there any news of brother?

336
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:45,400
Get ready to set out!

337
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,179
Hold on!

338
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,838
The exam in Chan State is a grand event.

339
00:23:56,838 --> 00:23:59,440
Why didn't anyone wake me up?

340
00:24:03,699 --> 00:24:05,839
It's not too late to join now.

341
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:09,420
Bear it in mind!

342
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:13,999
The valiance of Wind Takers surpasses that of Big Dippers'.

343
00:24:13,999 --> 00:24:17,099
All participants are present.

344
00:24:17,099 --> 00:24:20,659
Set out!

345
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:22,319
Set out!

346
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:35,310
[Chan State City]

347
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:38,960
[Chan State Academy]

348
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:54,418
The first disciple of Wind Taker Institute, Zhao Xifan, greets the Headmaster.

349
00:24:54,418 --> 00:24:56,419
Where is your master?

350
00:24:56,419 --> 00:24:59,479
Our master has matters to handle; therefore, he couldn't join us.

351
00:24:59,479 --> 00:25:02,839
He has specifically asked me to greet you on his behalf.

352
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:06,199
It's known to all that Master Guo has always been a scrooge.

353
00:25:06,199 --> 00:25:11,319
I'm afraid he hasn't tagged along because of a few pennies?

354
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:15,758
Wind Taker Institute's business, you don't worry about it, Tianqi.

355
00:25:15,758 --> 00:25:18,598
Matters regarding Wind Taker Institute will be in my charge.

356
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:22,639
All right! Please stay in our annex.

357
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:30,820
This way, please!

358
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:49,339
- Does anyone live here?
- Can anyone even live here?

359
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:50,738
- Is this fit for humans?
- What place is this?

360
00:25:50,738 --> 00:25:52,258
- They really look down on us.
- Exactly!

361
00:25:52,258 --> 00:25:54,779
Rooms are suited to the people.

362
00:25:54,779 --> 00:25:58,219
Wind Takers and this place, it's the most compatible.

363
00:25:58,219 --> 00:26:00,838
What did you say? Do you think we can be bullied?

364
00:26:00,838 --> 00:26:03,998
Since this is the hospitality of Chan State Academy,

365
00:26:03,998 --> 00:26:07,920
it's disrespectful for us to decline.

366
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:13,059
- Eldest Senior , they are such bullies.
- This is too mean.

367
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,958
You two, go and clean up the rooms.

368
00:26:17,958 --> 00:26:20,718
The rest will come with me to check out the martial arts tower to get ready for the exam.

369
00:26:20,718 --> 00:26:23,080
- Yes.
- Sure.

370
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,859
Where's Lu Ping?

371
00:26:26,859 --> 00:26:28,450
- Right! He was still here just now.
- I didn't see him.

372
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:30,190
I don't know.

373
00:26:40,459 --> 00:26:43,800
You rascal, how dare you wander around here?

374
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,659
Young Lord Wei, since we last saw each other at the cliff, how have you been?

375
00:26:47,659 --> 00:26:49,480
How dare you mention that?

376
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,259
Do you know what place this is?

377
00:26:51,259 --> 00:26:55,018
This is Chan State Academy's turf! Should I teach you some manners?

378
00:26:55,018 --> 00:26:58,958
According to the law, a day before the exam, participants can be within

379
00:26:58,958 --> 00:27:02,039
five li of the venue to know their way around it. (TN: 1 li = 1/2 km = 1/3 mile)

380
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,719
What are you wearing?

381
00:27:09,719 --> 00:27:12,558
You don't even have decent uniforms.

382
00:27:12,558 --> 00:27:15,240
What kind of academy are you all?

383
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,380
We, Wind Takers, are short in clothing and food.

384
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:25,700
But we have Young Lord Wei here, right?

385
00:27:27,939 --> 00:27:29,520
Rong.

386
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,539
- Bring it here.
- Give it back!

387
00:27:31,539 --> 00:27:34,839
- Give it back!
- Give me back my money.

388
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:36,959
- Here, Young Lord Wei!
- Good passing!

389
00:27:36,959 --> 00:27:40,879
Young Lord Wei, your money, I don't think we need it.

390
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:43,499
Get lost!

391
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:48,618
Senior, the exam is around the corner, it'd be the best not to cause any trouble.

392
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:54,819
Fine, just you wait! During the exam tomorrow, I'll teach you a lesson.

393
00:27:54,819 --> 00:27:56,279
Let's go!

394
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,699
They are leaving.

395
00:27:59,699 --> 00:28:02,458
As long as the disciples of Wind Taker Institute are united,

396
00:28:02,458 --> 00:28:04,879
it's fine even if we don't have fancy clothes.

397
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,739
Martial arts practitioners should always do our very best and live up to our conscience.

398
00:28:08,739 --> 00:28:10,798
Eldest Senior is right! We'll definitely do our best

399
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:13,178
- and live up to our conscience.
- Yes! Live up to our conscience.

400
00:28:13,178 --> 00:28:16,418
Who knew that the useless Lu Ping actually come in handy?

401
00:28:16,418 --> 00:28:18,199
- That's true!
- Well done!

402
00:28:18,199 --> 00:28:20,419
He is pretty good.

403
00:28:20,419 --> 00:28:23,740
Brother, why have you come here alone?

404
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:27,000
Did someone follow you here?

405
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,899
Not really!

406
00:28:28,899 --> 00:28:33,140
It's just a fool who won't stop until she gets what she is after.

407
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:35,200
But she's pretty persistent.

408
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:37,840
Why are you looking for me?

409
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,260
My disciple is really getting more ill-mannered.

410
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,500
You didn't even ask me along when you left.

411
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:48,358
I told Mo Lin to come along for tonight, you'll need another treatment.

412
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:08,238
Does your treatment work at all?

413
00:29:08,238 --> 00:29:11,119
If my brother suffers any mishap, I'll have you killed.

414
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:13,779
Young lass, don't you know how to respect your mentor?

415
00:29:13,779 --> 00:29:17,580
You can doubt my moral standing but not my skills.

416
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,439
Brother, Brother!

417
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:30,519
Has he really died from the pain?

418
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,340
Brother.

419
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:40,260
Don't keep saying you'll kill him!

420
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:42,550
You're a girl, you should be more reserved.

421
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:44,370
Brother, you did it!

422
00:29:44,379 --> 00:29:46,578
How is it? Do you see it?

423
00:29:46,578 --> 00:29:48,878
Young lass, it's still not too late to be my disciple now.

424
00:29:48,878 --> 00:29:50,959
Apart from medical skills, I still know a lot more.

425
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,019
I'll offer you a life of luxury.

426
00:29:53,019 --> 00:29:57,220
This time, how long will his pneumatic powers last?

427
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,558
It's the same as it used to be.

428
00:30:01,558 --> 00:30:03,659
Before a joss stick burns out.

429
00:30:03,659 --> 00:30:05,919
It is still just until a joss stick burns out?

430
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:09,319
I'm an assassin, not a deity.

431
00:30:09,319 --> 00:30:12,100
If you want to pass the exam tomorrow,

432
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,400
he has to fend for himself.

433
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,679
Brother, there's not much time.

434
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:20,118
I'll do my best to protect you in the martial arts tower tomorrow.

435
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:22,500
You just need to keep going forward.

436
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:25,100
What about me?

437
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:28,859
What can you do? Can you get my brother into the tower safely?

438
00:30:30,219 --> 00:30:34,400
Forget it! As for me, I don't want to get into trouble.

439
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,640
Tomorrow, I'm afraid Wei Tianqi

440
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,939
won't let you off so easily.

441
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:43,219
If we can join forces tomorrow,

442
00:30:43,219 --> 00:30:46,760
- our chance in defeating Wei Tianqi might be higher—
- Eldest Senior.

443
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,440
There is no us.

444
00:30:51,819 --> 00:30:57,359
Brother, Eldest Senior has been helping you all this time.

445
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:00,119
You taught Wei Tianqi a lesson today.

446
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:03,639
I even thought that you both are now friends.

447
00:31:03,639 --> 00:31:05,560
He only did it to atone for his sins.

448
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,699
I did it for the exam.

449
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:10,100
We're just using each other.

450
00:31:11,959 --> 00:31:15,599
Now, I've recovered my Pneumatic powers.

451
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:19,719
Eldest Senior, don't feel guilty anymore.

452
00:31:19,719 --> 00:31:22,858
As for you, you have your own victory to seize.

453
00:31:22,858 --> 00:31:26,880
After the exam, we'll go our own ways.

454
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:31,259
Tomorrow, it's each to our own.

455
00:31:31,259 --> 00:31:33,300
Fine!

456
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:37,800
Tomorrow, we'll act as we please.

457
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:43,718
Brother, you're being ungrateful.

458
00:31:43,718 --> 00:31:47,520
We were never birds of a flock, let's just each go our own way.

459
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:52,100
Young lass, you really won't consider to become my disciple?

460
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,958
Rooms are assigned to every participant.

461
00:31:53,958 --> 00:31:56,299
You're not Wind Taker Institute's disciple, go and sleep outside.

462
00:31:56,299 --> 00:31:59,198
It's freezing out there, where will you want me to go?

But that lass is so stubborn.

Today, for the Chan State's exam, Chan State Academy and Wind Taker Institute will take part together.

481
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:34,179
There are seven levels in the martial arts tower.

482
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:38,178
After you pass each level, you get to open up the stone door to the next stage.

The person who gets the Tianying Stone before sunset and makes it out of the tower wins.

What is Young Lord Wei doing at the bottom instead of going up to retrieve the Tianying Stone?

I can retrieve the Tianying Stone anytime.

I just do as I wish.

Are you going to waste it on those people?

507

All right, you should all turn back.

Young Lord Wei has stated, whatever happens in the tower today is just to be kept to himself.

00:36:59,138 --> 00:37:01,718
No one needs to know about anything.

- Yes.
- Come along!

Which Pneuma are they testing us on this level?

524
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:57,568
Master has told us, the rock maze is arranged according to Qimen Dunjia Divination.
(TN: an ancient form of divination from China)

525
00:37:57,568 --> 00:38:01,688
It's testing us if we can use the Pneuma of Strength to get through this maze.

526
00:38:01,688 --> 00:38:06,050
Brother, you really slept through too many classes.

You're so smart!

528
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:12,160
With Wei Tianqi's skills, he is definitely lost by now.

529
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,280
We better get through the maze quickly.

The rules of the exam is that once you enter the tower, any casualties are considered accidents.

Today, I will let them suffer from accidents once and for all.

Do you know danger always lurks behind?

537
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:15,319
I dare you to be so clueless? That's my disciple.

538

You dare to bully her as you like?

539
00:39:17,439 --> 00:39:19,800
I've already planned in advance.

00:39:29,869 --> 00:39:33,339
- That's cheating!
- You're the shameless one.

Your mentor does come in handy.

00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:42,520
Young Lord Wei, have you heard of Mo family's Soul Revival Powder?

545
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:46,079
It can protect us from all poison and it's poisonous as well.

546
00:39:46,779 --> 00:39:50,559
In another word, we take precaution against weasels, not gentlemen.

547

- You... Wei Ying.
- Here!

Big Brother, head upstairs first! I'll tackle them.

551
00:40:04,339 --> 00:40:05,859
Useless bums! Attack!

552
00:40:05,859 --> 00:40:07,579
How useless!

553
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:34,679
There's some sort of gadgets under the floor.

554
00:40:34,679 --> 00:40:39,419
If I don't use the Pneuma of Energy to enhance my lightness skills, it seems I can't go past it.

555
00:40:40,759 --> 00:40:42,720
There's no one here to help me.

556
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,289
I'll have to start using my own pneumatic power.

557
00:40:53,529 --> 00:40:56,899
You, thief, you can't get away today.

558
00:40:56,899 --> 00:40:59,539
I thought I was stalked by some villain.

559
00:40:59,539 --> 00:41:01,539
It turns out to be Miss Qin.

560
00:41:01,539 --> 00:41:03,219
I'm relieved.

561
00:41:03,219 --> 00:41:05,660
What are you up to again?

562
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,679
Here is a lesson for you!

563
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:12,060
If you're too clingy, you can't find a good husband.

Don't attack me here!

You frivolous thief.

569
00:42:07,968 --> 00:42:10,979
You're the one who dragged me here.

570
00:42:10,979 --> 00:42:16,839
You're so highly skilled, why do you always act as if you can't do a thing?

571
00:42:16,839 --> 00:42:18,559
I'm already very handsome.

572
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:22,528
If I'm also highly skilled, I'm afraid Miss Qin can't help but fall for me.

573
00:42:22,528 --> 00:42:24,340
You...

574

You... You do what?

575
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:33,209
Do you really wish to stay here forever with a thief like me?

576
00:42:33,209 --> 00:42:35,399
Go and find an exit!

577
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:57,668
It doesn't matter! Anyway, I get to catch you this time. It's good enough!

Why are you so stubborn?

579

I've told you so many times that I'm not from Mountain and Sea Gang.

580
00:43:02,338 --> 00:43:04,599
Can you just be nice and let me off?

581
00:43:04,599 --> 00:43:07,739
Listen! You've been stalking me for some time.

582
00:43:07,739 --> 00:43:10,338
Wei Tianqi is the only one who set traps to hurt people.

583
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:12,280
I didn't do anything.

584
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:15,728
Why is it that Mountain and Sea Gang shows up wherever you go?

585
00:43:15,728 --> 00:43:17,838
You often show up near me as well.

586
00:43:17,838 --> 00:43:20,079
Does that make you my accomplice?

587
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:26,940
Miss Qin, the Qin family is from an aristocratic clan.

588
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:28,979
Instead of enjoying a luxurious life,

you're in pursuit of Mountain and Sea Gang and having a hard time here.

618
00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:48,440
♫ Don't describe my unfulfilled promise! ♫

619
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:57,330
♫ Don't interpret my hidden fire-smoke! ♫

620
00:46:57,330 --> 00:47:06,230
♫ Don't let the paper boat in the rough wave chasing me! ♫

621
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:15,030
♫ Don't wait until it's over to know there are you and me! ♫
