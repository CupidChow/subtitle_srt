00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:28,840
♫ The dark green sea is hazy ♫

3
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,760
♫ dissipating in a flash. ♫

4
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:36,610
♫ Rivers and lakes divide the world. ♫

5
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:40,030
♫ Ten thousands arrows are firing at once. ♫

6
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:43,990
♫ Who has time to worry? Who loves the color of blood? ♫

7
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:47,810
♫ At that time, spirits are high. ♫

8
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:51,590
♫ Who calls the world his home? Who dares let his horse freely run? ♫

9
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:54,370
♫ Silently, tears form in the death of night. ♫

10
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:58,210
♫ Heroes are cutting all ties, ♫

11
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:02,030
♫ giving up whether it's life or death, ♫

12
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:04,090
♫ never asking what the cost is. ♫

13
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:09,810
♫ Good and evil must be distinguished. ♫

14
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,660
♫ The wind blows off the snow. ♫

15
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:17,550
♫ On the body, etch multiple scars, ♫

16
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:19,810
♫ wandering all over the world, ♫

17
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:25,190
♫ only wish to ask for answers from this world. ♫

18
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:29,130
♫ A teenager doesn't have to be a hero. ♫

19
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:33,060
♫ There is no need for flowers in the dream. ♫

20
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,060
♫ Destiny need not be afraid. ♫

21
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:40,660
♫ Because you have him all the way, ♫

22
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:44,670
♫ experienced a handful of conquests, ♫

23
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:48,540
♫ overcame a number of challenges. ♫

24
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,650
♫ From now on, happy and free! ♫

25
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:56,560
♫ The only wish is, with the world, ♫

[Episode 12]

29
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,119
Have you forgotten?

30
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:30,730
I only attended the Pneuma Combat Convention just to find Uncle Wen.

31
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:33,940
I really don't care about winning it.

32
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:36,450
He is, now, waiting for me at the Xinghua House.

33
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,750
He is going to get my confinement unsealed.

34
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,170
Coward!

35
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,459
What did you say?

36
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:53,619
I said you're a coward.

37
00:02:53,619 --> 00:02:56,459
We made a deal to compete fair and square for once.

38
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:58,459
Yet now, you're getting cold feet.

39
00:02:58,459 --> 00:03:03,318
You're clearly worried about Xifan and the others but you insist on saying you're not.

40
00:03:03,318 --> 00:03:05,239
I despise you.

41
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,740
I, actually,...

42
00:03:14,859 --> 00:03:16,719
Sangsang!

43
00:03:19,419 --> 00:03:21,479
Are you all right?

44
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:23,060
Wei Hu, you idiot!

45
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:26,019
I said to shoot that guy! You almost hurt Sangsang.

46
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:29,539
So, it's you? Why did you ambush me?

47
00:03:29,539 --> 00:03:33,838
Lu Ping, the Pneuma Combat Convention is something all martial arts followers dream about.

48
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:37,638
You said you don't care! How arrogant are you?

49
00:03:37,638 --> 00:03:41,718
You... How dare you hold Sangsang's hand?

50
00:03:44,859 --> 00:03:48,758
Wei Tianqi, I don't have time for your drama. Just go!

51
00:03:48,758 --> 00:03:52,898
Sangsang, did this man bully you? I'll kick his *ss for you.

52
00:03:52,898 --> 00:03:55,658
Fine! I'll let you do that.

53
00:03:55,658 --> 00:03:58,820
But think carefully, Young Lord Wei!

54
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:02,739
Young Lord Wei, do you honestly want to fight me?

55
00:04:05,859 --> 00:04:07,639
You...

56
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:10,458
All right! I'll remember this, I'll let you go today.

57
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:13,079
Next time, I'll make you beg for mercy.

58
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,800
Let's go!

59
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,839
Miss Qin,

60
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,060
you should go as well.

61
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:35,339
This is the same outfit that Xifan and the others are wearing.

62
00:04:35,339 --> 00:04:38,530
It must be the new clothing of the Wind Taker Institute, isn't it?

63
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:41,619
If you really don't care about them,

64
00:04:41,619 --> 00:04:43,779
why do you keep it?

65
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:49,479
Fine! I won't force you to talk.

66
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:53,430
But before you go to meet Uncle Wen, come with me!

67
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:02,219
Just now, I embarrassed myself in front of Sangsang.

68
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:05,858
I have to turn this situation around; otherwise, how could I face her again?

69
00:05:05,858 --> 00:05:08,758
This won't do! I have to think of something.

[Lu Ping]

73
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,139
Found it!

74
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:41,879
I knew I had seen it here earlier.

75
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,200
What are you doing with it, Young Master?

76
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,878
Didn't Lu Ping say he's going to meet Wen Gecheng just then?

77
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:49,860
- Right?
- Yes.

78
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:53,419
That's it! Wen Gecheng is the invigilator of the Pneuma Combat Convention.

79
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:55,699
He is the authority, so I want him

80
00:05:55,699 --> 00:05:59,259
to help me get back to the convention and become the champion like a real winner.

81
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:02,499
That way, I'll shine in front of Sangsang and I'll have succeeded.

82
00:06:02,499 --> 00:06:05,539
Young Master, Wen Gecheng is the appointed invigilator of the convention.

83
00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:08,199
He stands at the very top and won't be so easy to convince.

84
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:11,479
- Perhaps you should give up on this plan.
- What do you know?

85
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:14,418
He's only pursuing wealth by working for the government.

86
00:06:14,418 --> 00:06:17,919
I don't believe there's someone noble among all the corrupted.

87
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,500
By the way, where did Lu Ping say he was heading?

88
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,079
I think he said Xinghua House.

89
00:06:25,739 --> 00:06:27,280
Let's go!

[Xinghua House]

91
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:19,838
That's not good! I have to inform Miss Qin as soon as possible.

92
00:07:19,838 --> 00:07:23,578
Zhao Xifan, you've got some nerve to participate in the convention being crippled.

93
00:07:23,578 --> 00:07:25,459
It's really out of your league.

94
00:07:25,459 --> 00:07:28,019
Too bad! Lu Ping is hiding like a turtle in his shell.

95
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:30,500
Today is really boring.

96
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:34,378
Qiao Ying, Shi Zhongtian, kill these two!

97
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:37,060
You can't!

98
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:42,399
What's the matter? We all know the risk of this competition.

99
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:44,339
You shouldn't fear death.

100
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:47,160
Come at me with your anger and hatred.

101
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,519
I'll step up for Lu Ping!

102
00:07:51,859 --> 00:07:54,378
Wind Takers' most senior disciple certainly has some guts.

103
00:07:54,378 --> 00:07:58,020
I'd like to see just how brave you are.

104

Eldest Senior!

Why did you bring me here?

107
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:18,858
Wansui Mountain is over there, it's one of the checkpoints.

108
00:08:18,858 --> 00:08:21,720
Xifan and the others are fighting for Wind Takers there.

109
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,199
You should've been there with them.

110
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:28,000
But right now, that's none of my business anymore.

111
00:08:31,299 --> 00:08:33,679
Then, why don't you dare look over there?

112
00:08:38,619 --> 00:08:42,598
Lu Ping, Luo Ting and his companions are masters of two pneumatic powers.

113
00:08:42,598 --> 00:08:46,249
Before I came to you, Xifan was already having a hard time fighting them.

114
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,170
Don't you want to know how they're doing?

115
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:53,939
Listen with your Pneuma of Sound!

116
00:08:53,939 --> 00:08:56,030
Listen to their voices!

117
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:25,199
No matter how good your Pneuma of Sound is, there's always a limit.

118
00:09:25,199 --> 00:09:30,019
There's still one voice you can hear no matter how far the distance is.

119
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,279
It's the voice inside your heart.

120
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:44,579
It's the signal from Ling Ziyan!

121
00:09:44,579 --> 00:09:46,459
It's almost the end for Xifan.

122
00:09:46,459 --> 00:09:48,559
They can't hold on much longer!

123
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:55,789
My brother always says, "Life and death are limited, but friendship is not."

124
00:09:55,789 --> 00:09:58,579
You can walk away without a care in the world.

125
00:09:58,579 --> 00:10:00,599
But I promise you!

126
00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:03,699
You will definitely regret the decision you've made today.

What spirit of Wind Takers? It's nothing in my eyes.

00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:36,419
Don't blame me for being merciless! Who has the firework to signal the quitting?

Light it and I'll let you go!

- I'm sorry that I'm late.
- Brother.

What do you want?

139
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:11,999
It's easy! Light the firework to signal quitting the convention.

140
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:14,820
Otherwise, I'll kill him!

Lu Ping, don't listen to him!

142
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:23,979
It looks like the honor of Wind Takers is more important to him than his own life.

143
00:11:23,979 --> 00:11:28,379
Do you also think that his life is not that valuable?

144
00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:31,920
Stop! I'll give it to you.

145
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,799
- Brother.
- Su Tang.

146

Hand it over!

Lu Ping! No!

148
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:04,118
Lu Ping, even though you're a strong rival, you still lost to me today!

149
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:26,580
You lost! Look closely at what you just fired.

150
00:12:30,619 --> 00:12:34,299
How is this possible? How can it be my firework?

151
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,258
It's over! Everything is over.

152
00:13:01,258 --> 00:13:03,300
Thanks to the beating you gave him.

153
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,619
Xifan has just mastered the Pneuma of Essence.

154
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,420
It's controlled by the heart.

155
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:11,940
So that was the legendary mastery of the Pneuma of Essence?

156
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:15,799
To be able to control others' consciousness and alter a short period of one's memory?

157
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:19,178
That happened because of you. Thank you very much!

Perhaps I attracted the Mountain and Sea Gang.

It's not that I'm not willing, it's that I dare not.

It's my fault he's hurt.

Master Wen was a bandit. The Mountain and Sea Gang has always resented him.

Even if you did make it on time, you'd just be one more casualty, nothing else.

252
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:42,080
Brother, perhaps, the reason you escaped the ambush is because

253
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,019
in the end, you didn't choose to go to Master Wen to find out a way to unlock the confinement.

00:21:46,019 --> 00:21:48,519
Instead, you chose your comrades.

Yes. It's destiny!

We're in the light but the enemy is in the dark. Don't do anything rash!

As soon as Master Wen wakes up, the truth will naturally be revealed.

00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:14,300
I'm tired of all the conspiracies and the deceptions.

If they dare come at me or threaten the people around me again,

00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:23,339
I will break the walls and fight until one of us goes down.

do you wish to defend yourself against what Minister Xia has accused you of?

266

I have nothing to say.

267

Your Majesty, it is the truth.

268
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,780
Of course, General Qin has nothing else to say.

269
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:13,699
Then Minister Xia, what is your opinion?

270
00:23:13,699 --> 00:23:18,299
Your Majesty, the reason that our main invigilator was attacked

271
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:21,859
certainly is because this convention is unjustified and without weight.

272
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:25,260
If those martial arts followers become one of us by winning,

273
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:28,319
it'll only bring this imperial court more disasters.

274
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:33,258
I urge Your Majesty to abolish the Pneuma Combat Convention.

275
00:23:33,258 --> 00:23:37,359
Your Majesty, someone ordered the attack on Master Wen.

276
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:39,919
It shows that some authorities are scared of exams

277
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:45,239
like this one, which doesn't require a royal background, and only focuses on one's ability.

278

The entire world is your land, Your Majesty.

279
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,019
These people were so bold that they abused their power, ignoring their emperor.

280
00:23:50,019 --> 00:23:52,499
What audacity!

281
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,899
Minister Xia,

282
00:23:55,899 --> 00:24:01,199
should we keep the convention afloat to demonstrate our empire's greatness?

283
00:24:01,199 --> 00:24:08,140
Or should we submit to these outlaws, be at their mercy and show our weakness?

284
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:10,619
General Qin, what is that supposed to mean?

285
00:24:10,619 --> 00:24:13,959
Your Majesty, it is imperative that we choose the actual people who have the talent.

286
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:17,919
Now, someone is purposely sabotaging the convention and violating the imperial power.

287
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,420
I shall never back down!

288
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:27,359
I swear on my life that I shall never allow those outlaws another chance to stir up our peace.

289
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:29,618
You're doing things the wrong way.

290
00:24:29,618 --> 00:24:31,680
Enough!

291
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,300
Follow General Qin's wishes to get this done.

As you command, Your Majesty.

I hope that Uncle Wen has woken up. That way, I can ask him about what happened myself.

00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:08,900
Oh, no! What is my brother doing here?

297
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:18,259
I was drinking at Xinghua House.

298
00:25:18,259 --> 00:25:20,960
And the young master from the Wei Family happened to be there.

299
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,820
Suddenly, dozens of assassins showed up and attacked me.

300
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:28,760
I was severely injured and fell unconscious.

301
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:32,480
When I woke up today, several days had already passed.

302
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:39,879
Sir Wen, do you know who did this to you?

303
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,159
It was the Mountain and Sea Gang.

304
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,219
Mountain and Sea Gang?

305
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:47,580
You have already become a government official,

306
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:51,639
so why are people like them still chasing after you?

307
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:57,100
Or was their target actually the Wei Family?

308
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:01,038
I wonder how Young Lord Wei is doing?

309
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,939
His three bodyguards are dead.

310
00:26:03,939 --> 00:26:06,680
However, he survived.

311
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:11,340
But I heard his injury was serious and he has yet woken up.

312
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:18,320
Three more kills on the Mountain and Sea Gang's record.

313
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:22,899
Sir Wen, why were you at Xinghua House?

314
00:26:22,899 --> 00:26:25,600
Were you meeting someone there?

315
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,038
Oh, no! If Qin Qi finds out Uncle Wen was there to see Lu Ping,

316
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:31,499
he'll never let Lu Ping go.

317
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,540
No, that wasn't it.

318
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:44,098
I suddenly felt nostalgic for Xinghua House's homemade apricot wine.

319
00:26:44,098 --> 00:26:45,800
Have you heard enough?

320
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,739
Come in, then.

321
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,720
Big Brother. Uncle Wen.

322
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,700
How did you know we're here?

323
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:04,419
I was very worried after hearing about Uncle Wen's accident,

324
00:27:04,419 --> 00:27:07,839
so I secretly followed you here.

325
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:10,000
If I knew you two had urgent issues to discuss,

326
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,760
I would've chosen another day to visit you.

327
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,059
Sir Wen, you need not worry.

328
00:27:15,059 --> 00:27:17,779
I'll take care of the convention.

329
00:27:17,779 --> 00:27:22,020
And I will certainly find the person who attacked you in Kaifeng.

330
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:24,019
I'll leave it to you, General Qin.

331
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:26,679
Sir Wen, I'll take my leave.

332
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,779
You already saw him.

333
00:27:36,779 --> 00:27:39,939
All good! Come home with me.

334
00:27:39,939 --> 00:27:43,319
Brother, I just got here.

335
00:27:44,419 --> 00:27:45,919
General.

336
00:27:48,459 --> 00:27:52,118
I recently received a crystal chalcedony.

337
00:27:52,119 --> 00:27:55,700
I'd like to give it to Miss Qin as an ornament for her sword.

338
00:27:55,700 --> 00:28:00,140
I wonder if you'd grant me the honor to accompany me to see it?

339
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:03,639
Brother, you're quite busy, so why don't you head back first?

340
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,859
I'll go with Uncle Wen to see the chalcedony.

341
00:28:05,859 --> 00:28:08,219
Since this is what Sir Wen wants,

342
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:11,050
come straight back home after you're done.

343
00:28:11,699 --> 00:28:14,760
Don't cause him any more trouble!

344
00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:26,859
Uncle Wen, where is the chalcedony?

345
00:28:26,859 --> 00:28:31,020
- Young Miss, you ought to know there is no chalcedony.
- Then why...

346
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:36,119
The things you want to know are precisely what I want to tell you.

347
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:38,999
But the general was present, it was not convenient.

348
00:28:38,999 --> 00:28:41,379
So I couldn't tell you the truth.

349
00:28:41,379 --> 00:28:45,140
What exactly happened in Xinghua House?

350
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:47,980
Actually, that day...

351
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:49,910
[Lu Ping]

352
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:52,199
Master Wen.

353
00:28:52,199 --> 00:28:55,879
That day, I was waiting for Lu Ping.

354
00:28:55,879 --> 00:28:59,780
He didn't show up, even hours after the scheduled time.

355
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:04,239
Instead, Wei Tianqi came to me with Lu Ping's badge.

356
00:29:04,239 --> 00:29:05,940
I worried my whereabouts were exposed.

357
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:10,480
Just when I was about to leave, the Mountain and Sea Gang ambushed me.

358
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,200
Watch out, Master Wen!

359
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:41,690
[Pneuma]

360
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,880
Where is Lu Ping?

361
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,780
I'll tell you.

362
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:00,599
Sir, he's right up there!

363
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:06,658
You mean that the Mountain and Sea Gang's traveler's left shoulder

364
00:30:06,658 --> 00:30:08,618
was wounded by your Bone-piercing Needle?

365
00:30:08,618 --> 00:30:10,579
That's correct.

366
00:30:10,579 --> 00:30:14,580
I specifically had them make the Bone-piercing Needle weapon for me as a self defense weapon.

367
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,178
It goes straight into the bones.

368
00:30:16,178 --> 00:30:18,259
If you don't know how to remove it,

369
00:30:18,259 --> 00:30:21,259
it'll deepen the wound and it won't stop bleeding.

370
00:30:21,259 --> 00:30:22,639
It is slow to heal.

371
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,340
I bet my needle is still in that traveler's shoulder.

372
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:31,580
Then why didn't you tell my brother about all of this?

373
00:30:32,959 --> 00:30:36,159
The general has always been biased toward Lu Ping.

374
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:41,079
If I told him I was there to see him, he might start to suspect him

375
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:44,300
of colluding with the Mountain and Sea Gang.

376
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,880
But why are you telling me this?

377
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:50,380
That day, Lu Ping knew about my whereabouts,

378
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:53,590
weren't you the person who secretly told him?

379
00:30:55,920 --> 00:31:00,319
From what I see, you would never hurt Lu Ping.

380
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:04,819
I have limited mobility right now, so please pass my message to him.

381
00:31:04,819 --> 00:31:08,859
The Mountain and Sea Gang has infiltrated Kaifeng, so he must leave immediately.

382
00:31:08,859 --> 00:31:13,140
As for unlocking the Pneuma Confinement, I will figure something else out.

383
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,920
I'm not leaving.

384
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:24,599
Since I've decided to fight alongside Wind Takers, I would never leave you guys.

385
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:28,298
Lu Ping, now is not the time to be stubborn.

386
00:31:28,298 --> 00:31:31,798
Uncle Wen has made it clear that this place isn't safe anymore.

387
00:31:31,798 --> 00:31:33,840
Miss Qin is right.

388
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,599
It was my lack of consideration for sending you out to battle.

389
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:39,838
But now the situation is different.

390
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:42,579
You already gained your reputation by standing out at the convention.

391
00:31:42,579 --> 00:31:44,698
It's only a matter of time before they will find you.

392
00:31:44,698 --> 00:31:47,658
Brother, just do what Eldest Senior has advised.

393
00:31:47,658 --> 00:31:49,539
I'm not being stubborn.

394
00:31:49,539 --> 00:31:53,019
I just know all too well how the Mountain and Sea Gang works.

395
00:31:53,019 --> 00:31:55,659
They're forcing me to leave Kaifeng.

396
00:31:55,659 --> 00:31:59,499
Once I step out the city, I'll step right into their trap.

397
00:31:59,499 --> 00:32:01,858
Your brother has heavily guarded Wansui Mountain.

398
00:32:01,858 --> 00:32:05,080
Currently, staying here

399
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,179
is actually the safest.

400
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:16,039
Young Master Lu, this is the wine you asked for.

401
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:20,439
Ziyan, when did you start following his orders?

402
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,459
It was an easy task.

403
00:32:22,459 --> 00:32:27,519
I thought a celebration was needed since you and he have made it to the final round.

404
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:33,100
Let's enjoy it while we can!

405
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:36,500
Why go to sleep without a drink?

406
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:40,639
Since the Mountain and Sea Gang is everywhere, then why not just stay

407
00:32:40,639 --> 00:32:44,500
and win the championship to restore the reputation of the Wind Takers.

408
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:47,279
The enemy is closing in, we cannot drink.

409
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,720
That, too!

410
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:52,399
Eldest Senior should be the first one to drink.

411
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:56,160
How can the rest of us, Juniors, dare to drink before you?

412
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,819
Have some!

413
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:09,959
Fine! Fine! I'll drink.

414
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:17,400
You, too!

415
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:26,618
For the past three years after escaping them,

416
00:33:26,618 --> 00:33:29,680
I slept half-awake every night.

417
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:32,138
For fear that any moment, I could be taken back again.

418
00:33:32,138 --> 00:33:34,400
I've always wanted to know

419
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:38,600
what it feels like to get completely wasted with friends.

420
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:46,960
I actually feel at peace even with the enemy already here.

421
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:52,900
If confronting them is just a matter of time, why don't we calmly meet them head-on?

422
00:34:05,699 --> 00:34:08,600
You're right! The final is right around the corner.

423
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,140
Any strength saved is strength gained.

424
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:13,960
Otherwise, how can we make the opposition surrender?

425
00:34:16,919 --> 00:34:19,200
I'm right here.

426
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,199
The champion hasn't been decided yet.

427
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:23,340
I will not show you any mercy.

428
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:28,100
Fine! But don't cry when it's my turn to beat you up.

429
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,998
- You...
- Drink first!

430
00:34:34,259 --> 00:34:36,319
- Eldest Senior, cheers!
- Cheers!

431
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:47,120
[Wine]

432
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,579
Brother!

433
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:33,800
Following your brother is not a good habit.

434
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:37,498
Brother, is there something on your mind?

435
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:43,599
I forgot to bring my clothes with me, so I'm going back to get it. Get some sleep!

436
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:46,780
You only told me, Eldest Senior and the guys

437
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:49,879
about your meeting with Master Wen at Xinghua House.

438
00:35:49,879 --> 00:35:52,399
But if the Mountain and Sea Gang knew about it,

439
00:35:52,399 --> 00:35:56,060
then who was it that leaked the information?

440
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,319
Little Sister, you've grown up.

441
00:36:03,319 --> 00:36:07,699
Besides eating candy, I see thinking has become your hobby.

442
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,419
Eldest Senior and Mo Lin have been with me the entire time.

443
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:14,119
Miss Qin and the Mountain and Sea Gang are enemies.

444
00:36:14,119 --> 00:36:19,338
Even if it was the Wei Family, they would never trade for anything using Wei Tianqi's safety.

445
00:36:19,338 --> 00:36:24,439
There's only one person who knows when and where you were going to see Master Wen,

446
00:36:24,439 --> 00:36:26,880
and who also wasn't with us.

447
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:31,498
And only this person can make you upset and leave the camp secretly in the middle of the night!

448
00:36:31,498 --> 00:36:33,119
Stop it!

449
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:44,079
Brother, let me accompany you.

450
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:03,319
Guo Youdao! Have you teamed up with Lu Ping?

451
00:37:03,319 --> 00:37:06,178
- I—
- After my son bumped into him in Kaifeng,

452
00:37:06,178 --> 00:37:09,979
he not only lost the convention, but also got severely injured.

453
00:37:09,979 --> 00:37:11,839
I'm pissed too!

454
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,860
I will not tolerate this anymore!

455
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:15,939
Your son is stupid!

456
00:37:15,939 --> 00:37:18,558
And you're trying to smear my disciple's name!

457
00:37:18,558 --> 00:37:20,078
How embarrassing!

458
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:23,100
- Don't come near me!
- Don't you lie! I already know everything.

459
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,778
Before he set off for Xinghua House, he found Lu Ping's badge.

460
00:37:25,778 --> 00:37:28,428
Tell me now! Did you two team up to bully him?

461
00:37:28,428 --> 00:37:32,280
The Wind Taker Institute cares only about the convention! But you?

462
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:36,920
You keep persecuting, threatening, and chasing after us!

463
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:39,780
I get it now.

464
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:43,339
Because Young Master Wei was unwilling to leave the convention,

465
00:37:43,339 --> 00:37:45,288
he tried to stop my disciple; instead, what happened?

466
00:37:45,289 --> 00:37:50,139
- He took a rock and dropped it on his foot!
- You...

467
00:37:50,139 --> 00:37:52,099
You're just an old ignorant bastard.

468
00:37:52,099 --> 00:37:54,538
Get him! And then go get Lu Ping!

469
00:37:54,538 --> 00:37:56,939
Don't, don't, don't!

470
00:37:56,939 --> 00:37:59,599
Lu Ping? What are you doing here?

471
00:38:00,339 --> 00:38:02,939
Get him! Stop!

472
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,318
- How mighty Master Wei is!
- It hurts, it hurts!

473
00:38:05,318 --> 00:38:07,658
We heard there's been an attempted murder recently in Kaifeng.

474
00:38:07,658 --> 00:38:10,399
The Agile Dragon Army is here to investigate.

475
00:38:10,399 --> 00:38:13,099
You know my brother and the Qin's aren't just acquaintances.

476
00:38:13,099 --> 00:38:16,658
We just saw the Agile Dragon Army, I'll get them right now.

477
00:38:16,658 --> 00:38:19,058
Don't, don't, don't! I...

478
00:38:19,058 --> 00:38:23,399
Listen carefully! One day, Wind Taker Institute will cease to exist.

479
00:38:36,619 --> 00:38:38,199
Lu Ping,

480
00:38:38,739 --> 00:38:40,599
I was too emotional.

481
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:42,298
I let my emotions take over me.

482
00:38:42,298 --> 00:38:44,799
Sir Wei is the last person I should've of ever offended.

483
00:38:44,799 --> 00:38:47,608
Master, that's not important.

484
00:38:47,608 --> 00:38:50,939
I'll become the champion of the Pneuma Combat Convention.

485
00:38:50,939 --> 00:38:53,399
No one will dare bully us again.

486
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,220
Have you thought it through?

487
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:57,138
Do you really want to become an official?

488
00:38:57,138 --> 00:38:59,499
Then, what do you want me to do?

489
00:38:59,499 --> 00:39:03,000
Leave? Or stay?

490
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:11,499
Master, they didn't hurt you earlier, did they?

491
00:39:16,259 --> 00:39:19,919
Those minions are nobody to me.

492
00:39:20,839 --> 00:39:22,539
Stop messing around, you two.

493
00:39:22,539 --> 00:39:26,458
Go back to Wansui Mountain now! The final round is coming up.

494
00:39:27,769 --> 00:39:30,509
I'm heading back to rest.

495
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:36,360
Brother, could it really be Master?

496
00:39:37,779 --> 00:39:39,959
Su Tang, did you notice something just then?

497
00:39:39,959 --> 00:39:42,199
When Wei Ming grabbed the Master,

498
00:39:42,199 --> 00:39:44,579
not only couldn't he defend himself,

499
00:39:44,579 --> 00:39:47,660
but he also had to protect the left side of his body.

500
00:39:48,769 --> 00:39:51,829
Do you remember the Bone-piercing Needle Qin Sang mentioned?

501
00:39:52,809 --> 00:39:55,600
Could all this just be a coincidence?

502
00:39:55,600 --> 00:40:00,500
Perhaps... Master just didn't want to offend Wei Zhong.

503
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:03,619
He doesn't like trouble; you know that, too.

504
00:40:03,619 --> 00:40:05,480
Brother.

505
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:08,809
Do you really have the heart to doubt him?

506
00:40:10,659 --> 00:40:15,580
It looks like we really do need to win this competition.

507
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:18,328
- Brother.
- Su Tang.

508
00:40:18,328 --> 00:40:20,579
I don't want to doubt him.

509
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,609
I wouldn't dare.

510
00:40:25,179 --> 00:40:28,590
It looks like the longer we stay in Wansui Mountain,

511
00:40:29,139 --> 00:40:31,780
the safer we will be.

512
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:21,429
This is the only way to keep others from smelling the blood.

513
00:41:21,429 --> 00:41:26,600
Who would have thought this kid has started doubting me.

514
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,419
What's on your mind?

515
00:41:57,419 --> 00:42:01,868
Miss Qin, is what happened in Xinghua House really serious?

516
00:42:01,868 --> 00:42:05,839
This concerns the Mountain and Sea Gang, my brother is investigating it already.

517
00:42:06,779 --> 00:42:08,480
Why are you suddenly concerned about it?

518
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,019
Tomorrow's final round will be held in the ring.

519
00:42:11,019 --> 00:42:13,979
Young Master Zhao Xifan is still wounded.

520
00:42:13,979 --> 00:42:16,158
Su Tang and Mo Lin are not your rivals.

521
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:20,160
The only remaining competitor you have is Lu Ping.

522
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:24,618
I've been waiting for this day to come so that I can finally teach this brat a lesson.

523
00:42:24,618 --> 00:42:27,839
Miss, if they lose to you,

524
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,298
they'll probably be assigned to an ordinary position,

525
00:42:30,298 --> 00:42:33,720
and be stationed in various places, right?

526
00:42:35,079 --> 00:42:38,898
Ling Ziyan, what exactly do you want to say?

527
00:42:40,299 --> 00:42:43,198
Miss, you come from a wealthy family and you have the general's protection.

528
00:42:43,198 --> 00:42:45,059
However, Young Master Lu has a poor background.

529
00:42:45,059 --> 00:42:48,879
If the emperor doesn't reward him, I'm afraid it'll be disaster for him.

530
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:54,460
Are you asking me to lose to him in the final round?

531
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:10,260
[Ending OST: "The Paper Boat"]
[by Zhiqian Xue — Singers: Zhiqian Xue and Kewei Yu]

532
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:16,380
♫ Waiting to be buried by the lake in the town, ♫

533
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:22,470
♫ the White Paper Boat drifting with sorrow. ♫

534
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:28,280
♫ Lights on the other side of the sea ♫

535
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:36,910
♫ punched fingertips in the red water tower. ♫

536
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:46,330
♫ Watch the little boat churning, laughing at the ordinariness. ♫

537
00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:50,660
♫ Like a kite being pulled into a low altitude, ♫

538
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:56,120
♫ I smiled to the leaving person. ♫

539
00:43:56,120 --> 00:44:00,410
♫ The more spotlight, the more vivid the story. ♫

540
00:44:00,410 --> 00:44:05,380
♫ Laughing like the moon, ♫

541
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:09,910
♫ regretting the lighthouse broke in the waves, ♫

542
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:17,170
♫ I call the Milky Way that isolates us all, blue. ♫

543
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:24,530
♫ Like a moat built under the sea, ♫

544
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:29,370
♫ waiting for the words on the paper boat to disappear, ♫

545
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:36,470
♫ there must always be someone who doesn’t remember listening to the other. ♫

546
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:44,060
♫ Anyone who is correctly guessed will end in disfavor. ♫

547
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:48,240
♫ You are particularly touched but others consider it ordinary. ♫

548
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:53,650
♫ Like the author, roughly put down with a weak stroke, ♫

549
00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:57,940
♫ the writing boat on the lake was just like a paper crane in the air. ♫

550
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:02,770
♫ Laughing like the moon, ♫

551
00:45:02,770 --> 00:45:07,490
♫ regretting the lighthouse broke in the waves, ♫

552
00:45:07,490 --> 00:45:15,600
♫ I call the Milky Way that isolates us all, blue. ♫

553
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:22,410
♫ Can a moat be built on the seabed? ♫

554
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:26,810
♫ Wipe all the words on the paper boat! ♫

555
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:34,150
♫ Please let someone not remember and don't tell another! ♫

556
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:41,330
♫ Hide the reluctance between words ♫

557
00:45:41,330 --> 00:45:45,970
♫ Unfortunately, I (you) are an average author ♫

558
00:45:45,970 --> 00:45:53,700
♫ No matter how you (I) describe the rest, it's unnecessary! ♫

559
00:45:55,670 --> 00:46:04,430
♫ Don't describe my unfulfilled promise! ♫

560
00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:13,180
♫ Don't interpret my hidden fire-smoke! ♫

561
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:22,230
♫ Don't let the paper boat in the rough wave chasing me! ♫

562
00:46:22,230 --> 00:46:30,800
♫ Don't wait until it's over to know there are you and me! ♫
