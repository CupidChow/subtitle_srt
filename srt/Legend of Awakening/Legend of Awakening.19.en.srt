♫ The dark green sea is hazy ♫

3
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,810
♫ dissipating in a flash. ♫

4
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:36,650
♫ Rivers and lakes divide the world. ♫

5
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:39,950
♫ Ten thousands arrows are firing at once. ♫

6
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:43,940
♫ Who has time to worry? Who loves the color of blood? ♫

7
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:47,780
♫ At that time, spirits are high. ♫

8
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:51,650
♫ Who calls the world his home? Who dares let his horse freely run? ♫

9
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:54,280
♫ Silently, tears form in the death of night. ♫

10
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,260
♫ Heroes are cutting all ties, ♫

11
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,040
♫ giving up whether it's life or death, ♫

12
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,170
♫ never asking what the cost is. ♫

13
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:09,890
♫ Good and evil must be distinguished. ♫

♫ wandering all over the world, ♫

17

[Episode 19]

29
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,760
Master, what happened?

30
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,240
You were smashed by Old Guo's star of destiny.

31
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,039
Now all of your meridians are locked.

32
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,260
Your pneumatic powers are all gone.

33
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,960
Was he kidding me?

34
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,420
Why did he do it?

35
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:46,000
Who knows what he was thinking?

36
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,020
He would never harm me, would he?

37
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,360
Don't think about it! Just rest for now.

38
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:17,760
The double stars of Kaiyang, one is light and the other is dark.

39
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,840
They complement each other.

40
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:32,679
Guo Youdao, you died but your star of destiny didn't fall.

41
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:37,480
You escorted Lu Ping to the Big Dipper with your pneumatic powers,

42
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,760
because you knew that his Pneuma Confinement

43
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,610
would stop him from lighting his star.

44
00:03:45,619 --> 00:03:50,130
The connecting star of destiny ceremony should connect your star to your destiny.

45
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:55,610
In reality, it has led your star to Lu Ping's destiny.

46
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,620
How sly you are!

47
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:19,140
I, Guo Youdao, had never sacrificed anything in my life

48
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:23,420
but I have thought of a good plan.

49
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,320
In the end,

50
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,060
what exactly is your plan?

51
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:53,220
Master, I have already defeated the disciple of Guo Youdao.

52
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,840
Why are you still dissatisfied?

53
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,720
What do you know?

54
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,940
Guo Youdao never lost that easily.

55
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:11,980
Master, but why?

56
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,540
In order to beat him,

57
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:21,780
I have trained for years to light the star of Kaiyang. (TN: the 6th star of the Big Dipper)

58
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:26,359
I thought the brightest star of the two was the best.

59
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,880
So I was always better than him.

60
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,080
But today,

61
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:38,320
he cared so little for his destiny

62
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,380
and gave his star to Lu Ping.

63
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,240
Did he really care so little about the consequences?

64
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,480
Impossible!

65
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:03,440
He must have some plots.

66
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,920
What are they?

67
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,200
What did he want?

You will get better as time goes by.

72

What did Old Guo do?

73
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,780
He was so cruel.

74
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,420
Initially, I had already broken two links (of the chain)

75
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:30,380
but he... made me into a waste.

You are not a waste but a hero.

77

Now, only you think this way.

Oh yes, and also your miss.

The Fifth Institute?

86
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,000
Junior Lu, we have seven peaks and five institutes in Big Dipper.

87
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,880
The seven peaks represent the seven stars in Big Dipper.

88
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,599
The five institutes are places for disciples to live.

89

According to the evaluation, disciples are divided into different institutes.

- I don't care!

He wanted me to hold off.

113
00:09:40,139 --> 00:09:44,140
I must train myself well and take this as a lesson.

00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,060
If you dare stain the yard,

163
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,740
I will slap you to death.

164
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:05,380
Tang Xiaomei, you are such a busybody!

165
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,570
Are you making fun of the new member again?

166
00:14:07,579 --> 00:14:09,750
Lu Ping has lost his pneumatic powers when connecting to the star of destiny.

167
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,990
He can't withstand being tossed about like this.

168
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,060
[Huo Ying - Big Dipper Fifth Institute]

169
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:18,360
The fume was too big.
 [Huo Ying - Big Dipper Fifth Institute]

170
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,960
Lu Ping, I never thought you would come.

171
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,830
I was just cooking in the back.

172
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:28,319
- Also, that one... Su Tang should be fine. Don't worry—
- Hold on!

173
00:14:28,319 --> 00:14:30,060
How did you know my sister's name?

174
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:34,579
Not only the name of your sister, but I also know how many puppies the dog in the back mountain has.

175
00:14:34,579 --> 00:14:36,340
You came from the Wind Taker Institute.

176
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:39,250
You were trained by Guo Youdao and Chu Min, two masters from Big Dipper.

177
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:43,820
You even killed Wen Gecheng from the Mountain and Sea Gang at the Pneuma Combat Convention, didn't you?

178
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:46,460
Sadly, you didn't keep your good luck.

179
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:50,200
A man like you would come here.

180
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,120
We lack all the things here

181
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,100
except rooms.

182
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:07,039
I take charge of the Fifth Institute but you have to take care of your own daily life.

183
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:09,100
Any questions?

184
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,710
Where can I train?

185
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,420
I must recover my pneumatic powers as soon as possible.

186
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,050
Do you remember those people just then?

187
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:16,210
Tang Xiaomei is compulsively neat and clean.

188
00:15:16,219 --> 00:15:18,220
She keeps cleaning around all day long.

189
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:21,170
The one holding a rabbit is called Zimu who regards the rabbit as his life.

190
00:15:21,179 --> 00:15:24,580
Also, that idiot who never knows what he is doing, is Jin Qi.

191
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:27,619
He speaks very little so as a result, I don't know what his hobby is.

192
00:15:27,619 --> 00:15:30,400
And as for me, I am a nosy parker. (TN: nosy parker is a gossiper)

193
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,810
My daily hobby is to nose around.

194
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:37,599
So now, Lu Ping, do you understand what the Fifth Institute is?

195
00:15:37,599 --> 00:15:39,800
It is a place for wastrels.

196
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,960
We don't need training, neither do you.

197
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:47,900
You all came here because of breaking rules so what rules are they?

198
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:52,739
We broke rules by beating corrupt officials and by distributing food to refugees.

199
00:15:52,739 --> 00:15:59,040
Anyway, as long as we listen Li Yaotian and do nothing, we are keeping the rules.

200
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,840
Enough of it!

201
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:05,240
Since you have come, just muddle along.

202
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,270
I don't care what you guys are doing

203
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:11,800
but I must recover my martial arts.

204
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,420
Do as you like!

205
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,720
I must finish running ten li every day. (TN: 1 li = 1/2 km = 1/3 mile)

206
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,040
It's the rule of the Wind Takers.

207
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:06,040
This place has traces of Master Chu Min.

208
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,160
There are also traces of Lu Ping.

209
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,760
They must have come and gone.

210
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,770
They should have been safe.

211
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:20,660
It just that my little disciple has been taking care of me for only two days.

212
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,660
It's still not enough.

213
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:28,420
If I stick the needle in now, I will be sick for two more days.

214
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,080
Time to take medicine!

215
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:38,100
- Are you all right?
- I'm all right.

216
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:42,900
I initially thought of helping you and freeing you from too much work,

217
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,620
but I am too weak.

218
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,959
It's strange! You got just a cold and have rested for so long.

219
00:17:51,959 --> 00:17:54,699
How come you still haven't recovered?

220
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:58,559
I didn't have Pneuma of Strength from my early years

221
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,400
so I'm weak.

222
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:04,379
Don't worry! I will take the responsibility for you.

223
00:18:04,379 --> 00:18:08,860
Responsibility? What do you mean?

224
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,719
I live with my brother from an early age.

225
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,140
I have never thought what I would be like without him.

226
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:18,840
Others always thought that I took care of him

227
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,800
but actually, I was the one who relied on him.

228
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:27,150
I didn’t expect that now, I’m not only alive,

229
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:29,060
but can even take care of you.

230
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,440
I have already grown up, haven't I?

231
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:42,979
Thus, you should be at ease! I will take good care of you.

232
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,959
I'm done for. I haven't met with many women.

233
00:18:51,959 --> 00:18:54,940
Won't I fall in love with such a little girl?

234
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,180
What's wrong with you?

235
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,440
Your face is so red! Where do you feel unwell?

236
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,819
I-I-I'm fine. I'm fine.

237
00:19:08,819 --> 00:19:11,020
Let me see!

238
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:20,460
Mo Lin, why did you put the needle in yourself?

239
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:23,600
I… I treated myself.

240
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:28,440
Why don't you have a stuffy nose anymore?

241
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,280
Your complexion has also gotten better.

242
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:36,660
I… Your medicine is effective.

243
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:40,520
So all of these days, have you been making fun of me?

244
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,940
No, I haven't!

245
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:45,810
Su Tang, please let me explain.

246
00:19:46,299 --> 00:19:48,020
You are too much.

247
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:54,120
Su Tang! Su Tang! Su Tang! Su Tang, listen to me.

248
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:58,239
I know I was wrong. No big deal! I won't be your master and you will be my master. How is that?

249
00:19:58,239 --> 00:20:00,680
Go away! I don't want to see you.

250
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,439
Master! Master! Master!

251
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,860
Master, Master!

252
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:18,439
You're kind to me only when I'm sick.

253
00:20:18,439 --> 00:20:22,760
Therefore, I long for your care and want to extend my illness.

254
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,240
I know my mistakes.

255
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,180
Please forgive me. Okay?

256
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:34,660
Do you know how worrying I've been about you and my brother?

257
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,220
I do know.

258
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:39,820
I swear! Lu Ping will definitely be okay.

259
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,600
You've already investigated a long time ago?

260
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,380
Of course! I do things properly.

261
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:57,440
After I had recovered, I investigated secretly

262
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,920
and checked with the owner here.

263
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,620
Your brother had fought with the Mountain and Sea Gang here.

264
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:05,520
After then, he was saved by Master Chu Min.

265
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:11,919
However, you've been cheating me shamelessly. You made me worry.

266
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,060
Master, wait for a bit!

267
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:17,999
- I found a strange thing.
- What?

268
00:21:17,999 --> 00:21:22,100
It's about the person who helped the gang to stab your brother.

269
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:26,360
- He was our senior brother, Zhao Xifan.
- Impossible!

270
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:29,480
Eldest Senior was upright, how can he be one of the Mountain and Sea Gang?

271
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,760
That's the reason why I feel strange.

272
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,000
People in the Mountain and Sea Gang are good at Pneuma of Essence.

273
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,920
What if…

274
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,680
The Mountain and Sea Gang is like a purgatory.

275
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,280
How can Eldest Senior live there?

276
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:46,240
No way! Even if it's for my brother, I have to investigate it carefully.

277
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,580
Let's go.

278
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:51,880
- Please wait, Miss Su.
- Who are you guys?

279
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,340
I am Aze from Wuji Manor.

280
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:58,380
Our young master entrusted our master to invite you two to our manor.

281
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:01,960
The young master whom you mention is…

282
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,260
Yan Xifan!

283
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:15,870
[Wuji Manor]

284
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:23,020
Who is the manor master?

285
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:25,220
He is very famous, let me tell you!

286
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:28,000
More than ten years ago, he ranked second among Seven Peak Masters of the Big Dipper

287
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,100
He was the senior brother of Master Chu Min and Master Guo.

288
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,020
He was also the leader in the martial arts circle,

289
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:34,780
the famous "Wild Sword from the Northwest".

290
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:39,020
I never thought that our quiet Eldest Senior

291
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:42,900
was the young master of Wuji Manor who was missing four years ago.

292
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:47,960
Naturally, I regarded him as a rich man at the first sight.

293
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:52,940
- His family is full of money.
- Mind your nose!

294
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:55,421
- I know, Master.
- You...

295
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,920
Manor Master.

296
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,300
Champions of the convention of Great Shuo

297
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:06,860
are no doubt these young heroes.

298
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:11,419
Thank you for your praise. I've never thought to be so well-known.

299
00:23:11,419 --> 00:23:15,579
- Are you... Eldest Senior's father?
- Yes.

300
00:23:15,579 --> 00:23:18,840
And I have also been trained in the Big Dipper.

301
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,240
Miss Su, you can call me Senior Master.

302
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:25,060
Senior Master, how did you know that we were here?

303
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:29,420
You two searched for people in public.

304
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:34,480
If I haven't been aware of that, I can give up my position.

305
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,640
Swordsman Yan, my master is very young.

306
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,320
If she offends you, please forgive her.

307
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,740
Could you explain the things about my Eldest Senior?

308
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:50,840
I invited you two just because of him.

309
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:10,299
You have helped exterminating two sects within a month since you entered the gang.

310
00:24:10,299 --> 00:24:14,980
A few more achievements and you will be given the chance of Xi Sui.

311
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,780
It can improve you a lot.

312
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:21,759
As you said, master got his skills by this method of Xi Sui?

313
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:26,599
Anyhow, haven't those with high martial arts been given to the master first?

314
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,639
Don't you see him training secretly every day?

315
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,320
No one knows what he is doing.

316
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:34,580
I even have to send people to protect him every day.

317
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:37,460
All the jobs cut out for me from him have been far beneath my ability.

318
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:42,460
We have no complaints as long as we are serving the master.

319
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:45,580
If you are willing, then you can go.

320
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,100
[Wuji Manor]

321
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:56,300
You said that Eldest Senior stabbed Lu Ping to be a spy in the Mountain and Sea Gang?

322
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,600
Xifan didn't hurt him badly so Lu Ping must still be all right.

323
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,240
Right now, he has been sent to the Big Dipper by Chu Min.

324
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,670
If you investigate the Mountain and Sea Gang now,

325
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:12,320
Xifan may be exposed.

326
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,259
Didn't I tell you that your brother was okay?

327
00:25:15,259 --> 00:25:18,260
Eldest Senior still likes to fight at the front line as always.

328
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:22,260
Several days ago, he sent us some news that

329
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:26,060
the gang may do something in Yuezhou near Tan.

330
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,480
That is where the Big Dipper is.

331
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,340
Therefore, I hope you two can bring this news to the Big Dipper

332
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,939
and warn Pavilion Master Li Yaotian.

333
00:25:34,939 --> 00:25:37,860
And that way, you can also meet with Lu Ping.

334
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:41,900
What about Eldest Senior? Don't you worry about him?

335
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,340
I am.

336
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:50,100
He is my son so how can I not worry about him?

337
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,740
However, since he is my son,

338
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:57,220
I will support all his decisions.

339
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:01,500
Living in the pugilist world, everyone has his destiny.

340
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:06,920
I must stay at Jin City to help him with all his plans.

341
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:12,700
But I don't want to delay the news he sent out at the risk of his life.

342
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,920
We will go.

343
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:19,420
Since my master go, I will go, too.

344
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:23,620
I thank you on behalf of Xifan.

345
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:27,220
I also prepared good horses. You can set off after a brief rest.

346
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:29,480
Don't bother! We are leaving now.

347
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,280
Swordsman Yan, we will visit again. Good bye.

348
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,700
Let's go.

349
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,620
Miss Su Tang,

350
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:39,220
I heard that you grew up with Lu Ping.

351
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:41,920
Do you know his origin?

352
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,500
We are both orphans captured by the gang.

353
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,940
My brother said his parents had died in a war.

354
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:52,200
But Wen Gecheng said that his parents had died in the gang.

355
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,900
Thus, I also don't understand what the truth is.

356
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,020
Tan and Shuo fought all the time.

357
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:03,540
The Big Dipper lies at the border of the two. You must take care.

358
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,509
- Steward.
- Here.

359
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,540
Escort them out.

360
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,900
Please.

361
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,260
Thank you.

362
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:18,060
How about Xifan?

363
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:23,120
Master, as you have planned, I exchanged with the army in Jin.

364
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,660
And disguised those condemned to die as businessmen.

365
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:28,300
We did a good job with the young master.

366
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:32,660
It just that I had tried to persuade him into leaving several times but he still didn't agree.

367
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,300
I have left the Big Dipper for more than ten years.

368
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,700
Now my son is related to it.

369
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:47,900
Is there really some relationship among things which can't be terminated?

370
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:52,740
Aze, you should send more people to help him.

371
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:56,860
My son came home after so many years. He can't be in danger again.

372
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:58,340
Yes.

373
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,100
I have only one chance.

374
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,380
I must succeed in one move.

375
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:29,240
You are too rash, Young Master Xifan.

376
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,260
How did you discover?

377
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,040
When you stood out of the door,

378
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:40,520
your heart beat too fast.

379
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:44,090
People who are about to do something big

380
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:47,520
should be steadier.

381
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:21,720
It's already so late, why hasn't he come back?

382
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,080
I don't know why he is still training.

383
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:30,399
Senior Huo Ying, you also aimed to train when you just came here.

384
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,320
You trained for one month, right?

385
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,320
I also just trained for ten days.

386
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,760
Zimu and Jin Qi, three days.

387
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:39,080
How long do you think he will train?

388
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:43,360
Who knows? No one will be an exception here in the Fifth Institute.

389
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,860
Remember to warn him to wash his clothes, and his face and feet.

390
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:53,260
He can't bring in even a tiny bit of dust.

391
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,300
Master?

392
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,040
Why did you send me to the Big Dipper?

393
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,660
Why did you seal my pneumatic powers?

394
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,980
If I didn't do these,

395
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:52,220
would you stay here quietly?

396
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,400
No one from Wind Takers will be left behind.

397
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,020
Eldest Senior is waiting for me.

398
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:05,940
I still have to avenge for you and for my parents.

399
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,040
What can I do here?

400
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,720
It is all controlled by fate.

401
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,140
If you don't just patiently wait,

402
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:17,120
how would you know?

403
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:22,280
Just consider it as the debt you owe me

404
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:27,380
and you have to pay back.

405
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:32,040
Master!

406
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,420
So strange!

407
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:50,920
My Pneuma of Sound has recovered.

408
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:54,740
Isn't it that my efforts these days finally paid off?

409
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,459
Senior! Senior, come!

410
00:32:01,459 --> 00:32:03,480
Did you hear something?

411
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,499
What? What do you mean?

412
00:32:06,499 --> 00:32:08,680
There is sound of metal.

413
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:11,600
Nope!

414
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:14,060
It comes again.

415
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:19,920
Wait a moment! Did you recover your Pneuma of Sound?

416
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:23,600
I have regained one pneumatic power and will regain the rest.

417
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,979
Just sleep! Sleep! Go on sleeping.

418
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,240
One Character.

419
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,920
What is he doing now?

420
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:58,819
Who knows? He said he heard something which no one knows.

421
00:32:58,819 --> 00:33:01,270
He seems to recover his Pneuma of Sound.

422
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:05,320
When will he stop?

423
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,870
Maybe after another three or five days.

424
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:08,890
Anyhow, he can't go on much longer.

425
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:12,500
Senior, we have waited for many days.

426
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,700
So how come... he is still training even now?

427
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:19,399
- Well, I quit! I will cook for you.
- Why quitting?

428
00:33:19,399 --> 00:33:23,819
Don't you see? As a new comer, he comes here to train every day.

429
00:33:23,819 --> 00:33:27,419
He talks little because he looks down on us.

430
00:33:27,419 --> 00:33:29,019
He just puts on airs.

431
00:33:29,019 --> 00:33:32,179
Everyone will have the characters on his face when coming here,

432
00:33:32,179 --> 00:33:35,159
saying "a wastrel of the Big Dipper" to waste his life here.

433
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:38,799
He has come here, what's the use of behaving himself?

434
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:47,160
I have to let him know the rules of the Fifth Institute.

435
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,939
Zimu, you always have good ideas.

436
00:33:49,939 --> 00:33:54,260
Little White, I indeed have an idea.

437
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:56,460
But

438
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,960
who will be the first to carry it out?

439
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:07,380
Again? The three of us?

440
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:10,729
You all really bully junior like this, wouldn't that be too cruel?

441
00:34:10,729 --> 00:34:13,630
Do you still regard me as your senior?

442
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:23,759
Forget it! I didn't hear anything, I'll cook.

443
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:30,079
Come along! It's your turn. Hurry!

444
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:46,440
It seems to be effective.

445
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,520
Master Chu Min,

446
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:54,020
Lu Ping is so tired.

447
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:57,670
Can you do something to help him recover faster?

448
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,650
He chose his own way.

449
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:04,070
No one can help him.

450
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,759
Did you send the letter?

451
00:35:09,759 --> 00:35:12,780
Why hasn't Qin Sang arrived?

452
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:17,380
Maybe she has something to do now.

453
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:38,179
Please send the message! I am Qin Sang from Kaifeng and I am here for Master Chu Min.

454
00:35:38,179 --> 00:35:40,660
You finally come, Miss Qin.

455
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:42,660
Finally?

456
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:45,540
We have been ordered by Master Chu to wait for you for a few days.

457
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,919
We will take you to Junior Lu Ping.

458
00:35:47,919 --> 00:35:50,300
Then, I have to trouble Senior.

459
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,420
What is it?

460
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:10,100
What did Old Guo want to tell me?

461
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:13,890
Why can I use only Pneuma of Sound?

462
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,000
But can't any others?

463
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,480
Young Master Lu.

464
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,960
Miss Ling.

465
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:39,639
Master Chu Min asked me to tell you that she heard from Xifan.

466
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:42,839
He had investigated where the Mountain and Sea Gang is and has left safely.

467
00:36:42,839 --> 00:36:46,059
- He will come to you soon.
- Really?

468
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:50,600
Eldest Senior is indeed the most senior.

469
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,800
He got the information so fast.

470
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,780
I am going to train.

471
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,080
I have to try even harder.

472
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,920
Don't go!

473
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,520
What?

474
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,950
I... When I was searching for you,

475
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:12,180
I heard that they planned to trap you.

476
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:16,100
They can trap me once but not the second time.

477
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,640
Lu Ping.

478
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,420
What again?

479
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:27,020
I…

480
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,260
I have something to tell you.

481
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,520
- Has he come?
- Senior Huo.

482
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,319
Didn't you say that you know nothing?

483
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,159
I just come to take a look. Can I?

484
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,480
He is coming. He is coming.

485
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,980
Start!

486
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,900
We seem to have captured the wrong person.

487
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:09,720
- What are you doing?
- Just kidding! Just kidding!

488
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,320
Nice sword skill! You are...

489
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,340
I am Qin Sang and I'm here for Lu Ping.

490
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:20,120
- Senior.
- Where is he?

491
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,700
Senior.

492
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,520
He-He is at the back of the moun-mountain.

493
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,720
Thanks.

494
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:39,399
Why do I have some bad premonition?

495
00:38:39,399 --> 00:38:41,900
It does feel terrible.

496
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:46,019
Little White, it seems like this mountain doesn't have two tigers

497
00:38:46,019 --> 00:38:49,799
but more like two tigresses.

498
00:38:49,799 --> 00:38:53,059
By the way, who… who is she?

499
00:38:53,059 --> 00:38:54,879
Never mind who she is!

500
00:38:54,879 --> 00:38:57,499
One has to be steady when facing such situation.

501
00:38:57,499 --> 00:39:00,060
Come, come, come! I'll teach you.

502
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:02,880
Just wait and see!

503
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:12,800
Ziyan? She's still alive.

504
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:21,620
Miss Ling, what do you want to say?

505
00:39:23,999 --> 00:39:29,579
Lu Ping, I want to ask you whether you can stay in the Big Dipper and forget about your hatred.

506
00:39:29,579 --> 00:39:31,699
I can take care of you and keep you company.

507
00:39:31,699 --> 00:39:35,080
We can live in seclusion for the rest of our lives.

508
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:39,720
Miss Ling,

509
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:49,140
do you misunderstand something?

510
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,660
No, I don't. You saved me many times.

511
00:39:56,660 --> 00:40:01,240
I'm very grateful and I want to marry you.

512
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:05,580
You cared for me when I was injured, for which I am thankful.

513
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:10,560
- But—
- Do you still think of my miss?

514
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,940
It has nothing to do with Qin Sang.

515
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:16,800
Lu Ping, Qin Family is high-ranking.

516
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,660
Miss will marry a man who matches her, selected by the general.

517
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:24,099
She will have a bright future.

518
00:40:24,099 --> 00:40:26,680
You two can never be together.

519
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,520
Besides, now that you are an enemy of Qin Family.

520
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:33,520
Miss will finally harm you.

521
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,780
I just worry that you—

522
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,840
Qin Sang?

523
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:43,520
Qin Sang.

524
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,860
I seem to come at a wrong time.

525
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,360
Aren't you having a good time?

526
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:52,320
- Good bye.
- Qin…

527
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:02,600
Miss Ling, what I am going to say will be said once.

528
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,380
Listen carefully!

529
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:08,959
I don't need anyone to serve me and you don't have to serve anyone.

530
00:41:08,959 --> 00:41:13,700
You have a new life so stop regarding yourself as a servant.

531
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:19,400
I will pretend not to hear what you said today.

532
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:43,379
He hurt himself here and there, and he has been going through a hard time.

533
00:41:43,379 --> 00:41:46,000
Stop torturing him!

534
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,760
He is flirting with girls out there with much energy.

535
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,899
He can't go as fast as you now.

536
00:41:52,899 --> 00:41:55,420
He will search for you after a while.

537
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:57,220
None of my business.

538
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:59,400
I am nobody to him.

539
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:08,480
Over thousands of li, one came on horseback. (TN: A guest from afar)

540
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:12,260
Since you rode here all the way, have a drink.

541
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:17,780
Master Chu Min, why are you so wordy?

542
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:19,700
You really won't drink.

543
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:26,500
Master Chu Min, have you seen Qin Sang?

544
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,439
I'm sleeping, be quiet!

545
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,580
Go back to your training.

546
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:40,319
Master, stop kidding me! Qin Sang knows no one here.

547
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:42,779
She must have come to you.

548
00:42:42,779 --> 00:42:45,979
Open the door, please! I have something to say.

549
00:42:45,979 --> 00:42:48,360
What do I lie to you for?

550
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:51,459
You ruined my drinking.

551
00:42:51,459 --> 00:42:53,040
She is really not here?

552
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,240
Really not here!

553
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,400
Then, I'm leaving.

554
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:08,359
No nonsense! Has he really gone?

555
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:11,160
Didn't you ask him to go?

556
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:14,060
But he should still stay a little longer.

557
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:15,960
So dishonest!

558
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:22,200
After a while, he will be far away.

559
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:38,980

00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:45,140
♫ Waiting to be buried by the lake in the town, ♫

561
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:51,240
♫ the White Paper Boat drifting with sorrow. ♫

562
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:57,100
♫ Lights on the other side of the sea ♫

563
00:43:57,100 --> 00:44:05,680
♫ punched fingertips in the red water tower. ♫

564
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:15,110
♫ Watch the little boat churning, laughing at the ordinariness. ♫

565
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:19,460
♫ Like a kite being pulled into a low altitude, ♫

566
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:24,850
♫ I smiled to the leaving person. ♫

567
00:44:24,850 --> 00:44:29,160
♫ The more spotlight, the more vivid the story. ♫

568
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:34,160
♫ Laughing like the moon, ♫

569
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:38,610
♫ regretting the lighthouse broke in the waves, ♫

570
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:45,840
♫ I call the Milky Way that isolates us all, blue. ♫

571
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:53,310
♫ Like a moat built under the sea, ♫

572
00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:58,040
♫ waiting for the words on the paper boat to disappear, ♫

573
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:05,510
♫ there must always be someone who doesn’t remember listening to the other. ♫

574
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:12,720
♫ Anyone who is correctly guessed will end in disfavor. ♫

575
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:16,980
♫ You are particularly touched but others consider it ordinary. ♫

576
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:22,230
♫ Like the author, roughly put down with a weak stroke, ♫

577
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:26,690
♫ the writing boat on the lake was just like a paper crane in the air. ♫

578
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:31,590
♫ Laughing like the moon, ♫

579

♫ regretting the lighthouse broke in the waves, ♫

580

♫ I call the Milky Way that isolates us all, blue. ♫

581
00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:51,110
♫ Can a moat be built on the seabed? ♫

582
00:45:51,110 --> 00:45:55,490
♫ Wipe all the words on the paper boat! ♫

583
00:45:55,490 --> 00:46:02,920
♫ Please let someone not remember and don't tell another! ♫

584
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:10,020
♫ Hide the reluctance between words ♫

585
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:14,630
♫ Unfortunately, I (you) are an average author ♫

586
00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:22,290
♫ No matter how you (I) describe the rest, it's unnecessary! ♫

587
00:46:24,290 --> 00:46:33,100
♫ Don't describe my unfulfilled promise! ♫

588
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:41,880
♫ Don't interpret my hidden fire-smoke! ♫

589
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:50,850
♫ Don't let the paper boat in the rough wave chasing me! ♫

590
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:59,590
♫ Don't wait until it's over to know there are you and me! ♫
