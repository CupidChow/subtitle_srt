♫ The dark green sea is hazy ♫

♫ dissipating in a flash. ♫

♫ Rivers and lakes divide the world. ♫

♫ Ten thousands arrows are firing at once. ♫

♫ Who has time to worry? Who loves the color of blood? ♫

♫ At that time, spirits are high. ♫

♫ Who calls the world his home? Who dares let his horse freely run? ♫

♫ Silently, tears form in the death of night. ♫

♫ Heroes are cutting all ties, ♫

11
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:02,030
♫ giving up whether it's life or death, ♫

29
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,880
When I arrived just now,

30
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,740
I found that your army had already surrounded the entire lodging.

31
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:32,540
Suddenly, I didn't know whether I was in Tan State or Shuo State.

32
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:37,420
It is a customary rule to guard the important area of peace talks with troops.

33
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,990
You say you came here to negotiate

34
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:42,580
but you brought so many soldiers here.

35
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:45,039
What you're doing seems to oppose to what you're saying.

Xu Tianbing!

37
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,960
Peace talks are good for both the countries and their people.

38
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,260
Besides, this is the decisions of His Majesty and your emperor.

39
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:58,200
What is it? Is General Xu unable to control the army?

40
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,759
Are you afraid of my Agile Dragon Army which has less than a hundred soldiers here?

Qin Qi.

42

General Xu.

43
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,860
Minister Xu, I didn't mean to offend anyone.

44
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:17,819
However, the years of war only made our people suffer and benefited others.

45
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:22,439
I also received a message recently saying that the Mountain and Sea Gang has infiltrated Yuezhou,

46
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:24,340
but no one knows what they are up to.

47
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:27,860
Therefore, in my opinion, right now,

48
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:30,280
we still have to be careful.

49
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,279
Enough, General Xu!

50
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,440
We're in the middle of a peace talk. Don't cause any trouble!

51
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:46,020
I say, Minister Xu, you are pursuing peace between the two kingdoms.

52
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,840
The peace talk hasn't even begun yet.

53
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,440
Your son brought back his friends from the pugilist world

54
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,519
along with Miss Qin who placed a sword to my neck.

55
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,999
They casually threatened me to a peace talk at the gate of my city,

56
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,960
forcing me to open the gate and let the refugees in.

57
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,940
Minister Xu,

58
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:08,940
you two must have had reached an agreement long ago.

59
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,120
As for me, I'm only a general,

60
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,040
maybe I should retire.

61
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,460
Please go on with your talk.

62
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,120
I will leave first.

63

General Xu!

64
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,999
- Minister Xu, your general is too arrogant.
- I—

65
00:04:29,999 --> 00:04:33,659
Minister Xu, my sister was indeed a bit immature in handling the situation with the refugees.

66
00:04:33,659 --> 00:04:36,120
Please forgive her.

67
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,500
It's just a misunderstanding. Just a misunderstanding!

68
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:43,059
Today, we have exchanged our peace talk contract but we still have some details to discuss.

69

Shall we call it a day?

It seems like the peace talk will not be that easy.

73
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,830
His Majesty issued a clear order.

74
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:06,830
No matter what, we must come to an agreement.

75

In my opinion, you should keep an eye on your sister.

Father, why did you come?

79
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:41,399
My good son and his friends from the pugilist world kidnapped the general of this city

80
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,419
and personally opened the city gate to let in the refugees.

81
00:05:43,419 --> 00:05:47,000
If I don't come back, everything would fall apart.

82
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,640
Father, General Xu was being too cautious. The civilians are innocent.

83
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:55,999
Besides, aren't you preparing to talk peace? Then, we would have to deal with those refugees anyway.

84
00:05:55,999 --> 00:05:58,619
If we take actions earlier, they will suffer less.

85
00:05:58,619 --> 00:06:01,899
As for my friends, they are my fellow disciples at the Big Dipper.

Please let them stay here. I will take care of them.

It's just that you need to be more patient from now on.

Since you have already left the Big Dipper, then you should stay peacefully at home to take care of your illness.

Don't waste time thinking about things like that. Furthermore, don't waste time writing these.

00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,970
but my older brother told me that

160
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:43,140
having a dream is not necessarily wrong.

161
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:47,360
If you don't even have dreams, then you really are dead.

162
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,959
As long as you don't lose hope,

163
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:54,640
your advice may be put to use one day.

164
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,180
Su Tang, I've only met you once.

165
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,480
Why do you help me like this?

166
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,439
Both my brother and I don't have a home.

167
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,760
Meeting someone who is willing to help others return home,

168
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:12,280
I really hope you can succeed.

169
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,800
I have had asthma since young.

170
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:22,200
Even my father lost hope in me.

171
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,700
You are the first person to say this to me.

172
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,960
Su Tang,

173
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,440
thank you.

174
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:34,240
After Eldest Senior left, you were also the first one to cheer my brother up.

175
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,900
I should thank you on his behalf as well.

176
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,160
Does Lu Ping really

177
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,460
care that much about his Eldest Senior?

178
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,080
It's okay. I can do it myself.

179
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:56,020
It's getting late. You should hurry to go to bed.

180
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,060
I will take the medicine.

181
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,640
By the way, send a message to Lu Ping for me

182
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,860
saying that his Eldest Senior will definitely return.

183
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,159
I have taken the medicine so you have nothing to worry about anymore.

184
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,920
Then, I'll head back first.

185
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:41,420
Boss, I finally understand what you mean when you said I should help myself.

186
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,180
You, pretty boy!

187
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:47,040
After taking my medicine, I guarantee you'll puke and have diarrhea a lot.

188
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,540
Let's see how you can still flirt with my master.

189
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:09,440
Miss, according to the general, we are in the middle of a peace talk.

190
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,660
Please stay in your room.

191
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:24,099
Did you climb over the wall again? Aren't you afraid of being killed by arrows?

192
00:14:24,099 --> 00:14:28,520
Didn't I already say that even if we don't live together, we can still see each other?

193
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,520
Have you got any information on Xifan?

194
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,990
[Pure Wind Courtyard]

195
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,760
It is already midnight.

196
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,440
He hasn't puked or had diarrhea yet.

197
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,500
Could it be that he realized that what I gave him was a laxative so he didn't take it?

198
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:25,320
He goes out alone in the middle of the night.

199
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,980
As I said, he can't be so perfect.

200
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,000
He must have some problems.

201
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:23,460
That's strange! Where is he?

202
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:33,320
I had also asked the scouts your brother gave me from the Agile Dragon Army to search in the city for a while

203
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,560
but there was no news.

204
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,440
What's about the peace talk?

205
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,260
It will start tomorrow.

206
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,400
If the Mountain and Sea Gang want to interfere,

207
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,900
they will certainly appear tonight.

208
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,640
It's just that Xu Tianbing is arrogant

209
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,300
and have had many conflicts with my brother.

210
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:54,260
My brother tolerated him for the sake of the peace talk.

211
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:01,700
He isn't so patient when interacting with me.

212
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:07,810
How can he treat work related and his sister related affairs the same way?

213
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,200
If one day,

214
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:15,700
some brat boy gets close to Su Tang, what will you do?

215
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:22,020
If Su Tang really likes him,

216
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,940
I don't care who he is.

217
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:30,000
Lu Ping, don't give your sister to a bad guy.

218
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:34,180
Xu Weifeng is not a good man.

219
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,020
Why are you here as well?

220
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:39,160
What? Lu Ping can come but I can't?

221
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,020
What's more, after having a breaking through last time, I have been successful at the Pneuma of Energy.

222
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,920
I don't need padding anymore when climbing over walls.

223
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,980
Oh right, let's talk about something serious.

224
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:54,140
I saw Xu Weifeng put out the candle and left his mansion in the middle of the night.

225
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:58,240
He was stealthy and suspicious so he must have some secrets.

226
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,160
It just that I lost him halfway through.

227
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,740
Otherwise, I would definitely expose him.

228
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:07,200
What were you doing outside his room in the middle of the night?

229
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,799
- I—
- Miss,

230
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,260
there was news from the Xu Mansion, saying that something happened to Xu Weifeng.

231
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:17,180
Miss Su Tang couldn't find her brother or Mo Lin so she came to you for help.

232
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:27,880
Didn't you say that Xu Weifeng secretly left in the middle of the night? Why did something happen to him?

233
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,940
Who knows what evil he is doing?

234
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:33,390
Maybe he detected me

235
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:36,190
so he lost me on purpose.

236
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:40,840
Boss, think about it! We are not the people from Tan State.

237
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,940
Who knows what he wants from helping us?

238
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:48,020
- Brother.
- What's wrong?

239
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:51,399
Brother Xu has been constantly spitting blood. We can't stop him.

240
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:01,379
Young master. Young master. Young master.

241
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,900
- Brother Xu.
- He's been poisoned.

242
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,680
- Where is the antidote?
- Are you exposing me in public?

243
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,519
- You can be jealous but this is his life we're talking about.

244
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,320
Did you poison Brother Xu?

245
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,720
I… I just gave him a laxative.

246
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,840
Who knew he would spit blood?

247
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,380
Moreover, you should ask him why he went out secretly in the middle of the night.

248
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:25,120
Who knows what he was up to?

249
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,900
Young Master heard that you've all been searching for Hero Yan

250
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,240
which is why he went in the middle of the night to give some money to the refugees

251
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,300
- in order to help you get information on this.
- Everyone can speak beautiful words.

00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:58,580
Master, I know I am lazy, greedy, and cowardly,

256
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:03,160
but I swear on my name of the World's No. 1 Assassin that I didn't poison him.

257
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,520
- You would rather believe him than believe me.
- Enough!

258
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,880
Mo Lin, come with me.

259
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:31,260
Boss, you told me to

260
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,919
- help myself.
- I didn't mean this.

261

Then should I watch master go with him?

262

Boss, Xu Weifeng is an outsider.

We are friends that are ready to die for each other.

264

Do you also think that I was wrong?

266
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,560
you might just have to apologize to Senior Xu first.

267
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,880
Okay.

268
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,400
How long has it been?

269
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,280
You already trust him so much.

270
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:06,680
Since you don't trust me, I should just leave.

He said he has information on Young Lord Yan.

00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,080
There is a mansion in the outskirts of the city,

which used to be the home of officials' concubines

it was my brother's mistake that you got poisoned.

We just met each other.

You didn't have to get involved in this,

let alone help us at the risk of your life.

no one thought I could achieve anything

295

Only Miss Su Tang kept encouraging me.

00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:34,740
Maybe to repay her trust,

297
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,840
I should do this.

298
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:44,240
Then I will accept your information.

299

Xu Tianbing was so aggressive so there are still many items that we haven't decided on.

307

It is not the time to worry about your personal business.

00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,679
Have you thought about if Xifan is really there, what you are going to do?

318
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:12,460
He never defeated me in the Wind Taker Institute.

319
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:16,780
Maybe if I beat him up, he'll wake up.

320
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,200
What if…

321
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,500
I only said "what if," that he doesn't wake up?

322
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:26,060
Have you thought of the worst situation?

323
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,780
During my hardest times,

324
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,500
eldest senior never gave up on me.

325
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,680
I will never give up on him, either.

326
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,760
It doesn't matter if he is good or bad, insane or silly,

327
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,540
I'll never leave him with the Mountain and Sea Gang.

328
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,620
He also wouldn't want to live like that.

329
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:01,440
Don't worry! The evil cannot beat the justice.

330
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,120
Xifan has always been upright.

331
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,680
He can't be imprisoned by the Mountain and Sea Gang.

332
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,300
My junior is so devoted to me.

333
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:14,060
I'm so moved, almost to a point of crying.

334
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:21,300
You said that I have never defeated you and kept saying you want to save me.

335
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:25,060
You're so proud of yourself! Aren't you afraid that I might be jealous?

336
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:30,960
Xifan, let's talk later when we are back.

337
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,360
It is not all fun and games at the Mountain and Sea Gang.

338

wake up!

342
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,479
Don't forget! It's because of you that the Wind Takers got destroyed.

343
00:25:58,479 --> 00:26:00,740
You are the one who needs to reflect on yourself.

344

I really am living very well right now.

345

Leader Zhou, take good care of them.

346

After our big event, take them to the Mountain and Sea tower.

You can go back first. I will take care of Brother Xu.

Don't worry! They are brothers.

There will definitely be a positive outcome this time.

I know I am lazy, greedy and cowardly,

People can use acupuncture points to create fake health conditions.

If Mo Lin didn't lie, then did Brother Xu really fake his

Why did you want to know the truth?

372

Young Lord Xu should have been more careful.

373
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:29,840
Just now, you could have been exposed.

374

Young Lord Yan, you are not qualified to lecture me.

Maybe this time I'll really need Young Lord Yan's help.

I heard Young Lord Xu is the son of the War Minister.

He also cooperated with Lu Ping in Yuezhou and became his good friend.

385
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:34,180
I don't know why you would want to cooperate with the Mountain and Sea Gang.

386
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:39,280
Allies, of course, are only made through mutual interests.

- You don't have to worry about this matter.

My father has already arranged everything for the sake of the peace talk.

He sends fresh vegetables to the lodging every day.

Once you're inside, just do as we planned.

Then the peace talk is bound to fail.

00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:04,439
You gave him to them, didn't you?

476
00:38:04,439 --> 00:38:07,540
Tingsong Villa was just a trap, wasn't it?

477
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:11,080
I'm telling you! My brother is very clever.

478
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,190
You are bound to be exposed by him.

479
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:15,690
He won't fall for your trap.

480
00:38:15,699 --> 00:38:18,180
Lu Ping is indeed clever

481
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:20,979
but he values friendship too much.

482
00:38:20,979 --> 00:38:26,000
People like him... can only be sacrificed for the greater good.

483
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:43,120
Lu Ping, the Mountain and Sea Gang may have made some sort of plan.

484
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:46,080
We must find some way.

485
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:49,099
Why don't I attract the attention of Zhou Youlong so you can run away first?

486
00:38:49,099 --> 00:38:51,719
- Then send news to my brother afterward.
- No way!

487
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:54,019
I can't leave you alone here.

488
00:38:54,019 --> 00:38:56,920
Once the people from the Mountain and Sea Gang relax a little,

489
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,220
let's take action together.

490
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,180
We will act according to the situation.

491
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,360
Our savior is here.

492
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,880
It's Mo—

493
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:19,140
You still talk so much when you are about to die?

494
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:22,040
It really sucks to see couples.

495
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:28,020
What about handing this girl over to serve me?

496
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:32,679
Leader Zhou, how does it feel to have Yan Xifan as your boss?

497
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:36,240
Just a betrayer who got kicked out of his home.

498
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,220
How can you compare him with me?

499
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:43,040
However, it's true that you're a watchdog for him right now.

500
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,500
You've been in the Mountain and Sea Gang for a while.

501
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:49,380
Wen Gecheng may have left but Yan Xifan came.

502
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:51,940
You are always just a servant.

503
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:55,560
- What do you mean by it?
- Didn't Lin Tianyi tell you?

504
00:39:55,560 --> 00:40:00,179
I am the Awakener with six Pneumas in my body and the best candidate for Xi Sui.

505
00:40:00,179 --> 00:40:04,860
If you take me back to the gang, at most you'll share half of the reward with Yan Xifan.

506
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:09,379
It won't benefit you much but if you get all six of my pneumatic powers,

507
00:40:09,379 --> 00:40:12,480
you can be carefree forever.

508
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:17,220
You don't have to be an idiot who is always obeying the orders of others.

509
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:19,620
Are you really willing to do so?

510
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:25,540
Xifan has said that I am too kind.

511
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:29,540
Let Qin Sang go, then I'll cooperate with you.

512
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:35,020
You want to sacrifice all your martial arts just for a girl?

513
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:36,970
I really overestimated you.

514
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:39,440
Lu Ping, whom are you kidding?

515
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,840
I am just an ordinary man.

516
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:46,600
If you are hurt at all because of me, I can't be at ease.

517
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:52,180
Zhou Youlong, the girl I like,

518
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:55,820
be safe and live long.

519
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:58,720
Let alone my martial arts,

520
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:02,780
I am willing sacrifice even my life for her.

521
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:06,560
If you improve your skills

522
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,760
and kill Yan Xifan, that traitor, for me

523
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,920
that would be even better.

524
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:17,560
Leader Zhou, you can't betray Leader Lin.

525
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:23,519
Zhou Youlong, if you dare touch him, I will kill you!

526
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:27,220
Leader, let's talk at another place.

527
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:30,220
I can't stand the scene of parting and saying goodbye.

528
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:32,800
We have to focus with the Xi Sui.

529
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,780
As I said, you can't leave me.

530
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:28,140
Are you okay?

531
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,120
I'm okay.

532
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:38,299
Just now, you said you like me and could sacrifice even your life for me.

533
00:42:38,299 --> 00:42:40,600
Is it true or were you acting?

534
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,840
I will tell you after all this is over.

535
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:50,859
Boss, please flirt at another time.

536
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:52,859
I saw our Eldest Senior in the city.

537
00:42:52,859 --> 00:42:55,100
He dressed like another hired-hand and got into the peace talk lodging.

538
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:58,579
There were many baskets on the cart and a strong smell of blood inside them.

539
00:42:58,579 --> 00:43:01,199
I thought something felt off so I came to find you.

540
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:04,079
Lodging? What is he doing there?

541
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:08,260
Oh no! The Mountain and Sea Gang want to ruin the peace talk.

542
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:10,680
Qin Qi is very careful about this.

543
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:13,360
Now Xifan interfered as well.

544
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,420
This time, things will become very troublesome.

545
00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:33,820

♫ Waiting to be buried by the lake in the town, ♫

547
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:46,000
♫ the White Paper Boat drifting with sorrow. ♫

♫ Lights on the other side of the sea ♫

♫ punched fingertips in the red water tower. ♫

550
00:44:04,590 --> 00:44:09,880
♫ Watch the little boat churning, laughing at the ordinariness. ♫

551
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:14,220
♫ Like a kite being pulled into a low altitude, ♫

552
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:19,580
♫ I smiled to the leaving person. ♫

553

♫ The more spotlight, the more vivid the story. ♫

554
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:28,910
♫ Laughing like the moon, ♫

555

♫ regretting the lighthouse broke in the waves, ♫

556
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:40,600
♫ I call the Milky Way that isolates us all, blue. ♫

557
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:48,190
♫ Like a moat built under the sea, ♫

558
00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:52,900
♫ waiting for the words on the paper boat to disappear, ♫

559
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:59,940
♫ there must always be someone who doesn’t remember listening to the other. ♫

560

♫ Anyone who is correctly guessed will end in disfavor. ♫

561
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:11,750
♫ You are particularly touched but others consider it ordinary. ♫

562
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:17,040
♫ Like the author, roughly put down with a weak stroke, ♫

♫ Laughing like the moon, ♫

♫ Can a moat be built on the seabed? ♫

568

♫ Wipe all the words on the paper boat! ♫
