[By Wang Sulong — Lyrics by Wang Sulong and Zuo Muxiu]

00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:28,850
♫ The dark green sea is hazy ♫

3
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:32,810
♫ dissipating in a flash ♫

4
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:36,590
♫ Rivers and lakes divide the world ♫

5
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:39,930
♫ Ten thousands arrows are firing at once ♫

6
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:43,990
♫ Who has time to worry? Who loves the color of blood? ♫

7
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:47,810
♫ At that time, spirits are high ♫

8
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:51,620
♫ Who calls the world his home?
Who dares let his horse freely run? ♫

9
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:54,410
♫ Silently, tears form in the death of night ♫

10
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:58,190
♫ Heroes are cutting all ties, ♫

11
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,130
♫ giving up whether it's life or death, ♫

12
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:04,220
♫ never asking what the cost is ♫

13
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:09,850
♫ Good and evil must be distinguished ♫

14
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,760
♫ The wind blows off the snow ♫

15
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,540
♫ On the body, etch multiple scars, ♫

16
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,760
♫ wandering all over the world, ♫

17
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:25,200
♫ only wish to ask for answers from this world ♫

18
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,170
♫ A teenager doesn't have to be a hero ♫

19
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:33,080
♫ There is no need for flowers in the dream ♫

20
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,180
♫ Destiny need not be afraid ♫

21
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:40,820
♫ Because you have him all the way, ♫

22
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:44,720
♫ experienced a handful of conquests, ♫

23
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,510
♫ overcame a number of challenges ♫

24
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:50,600
♫ From now on, happy and free! ♫

25
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:56,420
♫ The only wish is, with the world, ♫

26
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:00,230
♫ would come along the willing of change ♫

[Episode 33]

29
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,580
His hand...

30
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,951
was injured because of making Osmanthus candy for me.

31
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,411
He said he likes me.

32
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:47,151
At least, I should go to see how his hand is.

33
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,311
Oh no! I'm lost again.

34
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,760
A bird?

35
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,571
Maybe it'll lead me to a populated area so I can find someone to ask for the way back.

36
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,960
Su Tang?

37
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,500
Su Tang!

38
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,651
Young Valley Master.

39
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,460
- Did you find her?
- Young Valley Master,

40
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:17,159
someone saw Miss Su heading towards the direction of the Forbidden House.

41
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:20,239
Damn it! Isn't that where the old man goes to cultivate?

42
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:21,959
Valley Master hates it the most when there is an outsider in the valley.

43
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,851
If he bumps into Miss Su, she will be in a lot of danger.

44
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,451
Young Valley Master, what is that?

45
00:03:42,451 --> 00:03:43,840
The hottest chili.

46
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,731
I use it for barbecues on the road. I always bring it with me.

47
00:03:46,731 --> 00:03:48,279
I mixed it with sodium nitrate powder.

48
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,079
Valley Master uses the Pneuma of Pivot in cultivating medicine.

49
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:53,879
If he is disturbed in the process of cultivation, something bad will happen to him.

50
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:55,799
How can I save my wife without disturbing him?

51
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,419
Who is more important, my wife or that old man?

52
00:03:58,419 --> 00:03:59,900
Let's go!

53
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,599
Someone is coming. Someone is coming.

54
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,400
Who is it?!

55
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,599
Sorry to bother you, Elder.

56
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,559
I am lost. Can you tell me the way to Mo Lin's residence?

57
00:04:41,559 --> 00:04:43,691
Mo Lin?

58
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:52,439
That brat, he finally came back by himself.

59
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:55,159
Then there will be no return.

60
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,979
He won't be able to leave again!

61
00:04:56,979 --> 00:04:59,931
Elder, you are probably part of the Mo Clan as well?

62
00:04:59,931 --> 00:05:01,659
He is the Young Valley Master.

63
00:05:01,659 --> 00:05:04,531
By saying this, aren't you afraid of falling out with him?

64
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:15,271
You were brought in by Mo Lin from the outside, right?

65
00:05:15,271 --> 00:05:17,959
You, outsiders, are talking nonsense all day!

66
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:21,919
You made that brat make up his mind to be an assassin.

67
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,399
He's just wasting his life away every day.

68
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,239
He wants to be the best assassin in the world.

69
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,599
You can look down on him but you can't look down on his dream.

70
00:05:30,599 --> 00:05:32,900
No outsiders are allowed in Carefree Valley.

71
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,460
Since you're here,

72
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:37,991
you can come in alive and leave dead!

73
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,999
Elder! Elder!

74
00:05:52,999 --> 00:05:55,599
Are you okay? Get up!

75
00:05:55,599 --> 00:05:56,599
- Be careful!
- I don't need your help.

76
00:05:56,599 --> 00:05:57,839
Do you think I want to help you?

77
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,159
This is my disciple's home. I don't want anyone to die here.

78
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:02,939
It will get haunted. Let's go!

79
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,099
Young Valley Master,

80
00:06:07,099 --> 00:06:10,759
once the Pneuma of Pivot is disturbed, the Valley Master will be severely injured and not be able to move.

81
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:11,799
Why didn't you tell me earlier?!

82
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,971
You never let me finish what I had to say!

83
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,019
Miss Su? How is our Valley Master?

84
00:06:20,019 --> 00:06:22,960
This elder is the Valley Master?

85
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,199
Old man! Old man, wake up! Old man.

86
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,480
You brat!

87
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,559
Didn't you make a huge fuss in Carefree Valley back then saying that you wouldn't come back until you become an assassin?!
[Mo Buliu: Carefree Valley Valley Master]

88
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,959
How come you're back before living up to your word?

89
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,300
If I hadn't returned in time, you would die in there!

90
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,319
I would be fine if you didn't come back!

91
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:45,720
- I... I... I...
- I... I... I...

92
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,599
He is our Valley Master, Mo Buliu.

93
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,791
He thinks that the Mo Family should learn medicine for generations to come.

94
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:54,251
Young Valley Master had asked me to sneak him out of the valley.

95
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,160
Elder,

96
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,159
please forgive me for being impolite just before.

97
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:00,580
I am Mo Lin's Master.

98
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,591
My name is Su Tang.

99
00:07:02,591 --> 00:07:05,619
Old man, now you've seen the strength of my master's pneumatic powers.

100
00:07:05,619 --> 00:07:08,279
I also have a boss and a senior brother.

101
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,199
One could use all six Pneumas. It's just that he is blocked by Pneuma Confinement.

102
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,199
The other is the young master of Wuji Manor.

103
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,999
I've been an assassin for a long time already.

104
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,591
I am much more accomplished than you.

105
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,571
You said you have a friend

106
00:07:22,571 --> 00:07:24,479
who has been blocked by Pneuma Confinement?

107
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:28,411
Is he called Ping'er?

108
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,119
Father, how do you know my boss?

109
00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:34,279
It's not like you're going to stay in the valley. Why should I tell you?

110
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:37,131
I won't tell you. I won't tell you.

111
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:41,199
Isn't this the old man's favorite parrot?

112
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:45,059
Master, why do you save such an annoying thing?

113
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,560
It's a life. I didn't think too much.

114
00:07:52,499 --> 00:07:57,139
Fine! I'll tell you for the sake of you saving Little Mo.

115
00:07:57,139 --> 00:07:59,159
I once saved a child.

116
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:03,639
I personally gave him the Pneuma Confinement.

117
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:06,471
How could I not know about it?

118
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,519
Father, why didn't you say so earlier?

119
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:13,079
Did you ever come back home? Have you ever written a single letter to me?

120
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:17,931
If I bring my brother here, can you unlock the Pneuma Confinement?

121
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,540
No,

122
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,291
but I can try.

123
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:28,479
That's great.

124
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,700
It's worth it coming to Carefree Valley with you this time.

125
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,391
Let's go and find my brother.

126
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,571
Master, it's time to go.

127
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,251
Disciple, why aren't we leaving yet?

128
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,790
After everything, I am still just your disciple.

129
00:09:18,471 --> 00:09:20,740
Why are you still standing there?

130
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:29,239
Say, isn't Young Valley Master allergic to Osmanthus pollen?

131
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,039
He personally picked many Osmanthus flowers that had just bloomed yesterday.

132
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,671
No one knew what he was doing.

133
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,660
Master, does this mean you promise me?

134
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:54,939
I promise you! From now on, I will never feed anyone candy besides you.

135
00:09:54,939 --> 00:09:58,399
As for the rest, let's wait until my brother comes and we'll talk about it.

136
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,259
Master, don't worry.

137
00:10:00,259 --> 00:10:02,651
I'm patient.

138
00:10:02,651 --> 00:10:06,691
But... can you give me a hug? Just one!

139
00:10:06,691 --> 00:10:10,430
Let's go! I will still hit you if you delay my trip.

140
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:13,979
Master, wait for me!

141
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,360
- Young Master.
- Young Master.

142
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,360
You're not as good as me on horseback.

143
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,839
In terms of being proper and prudent, I'm afraid the whole Big Dipper can't be compared to you.

144
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:40,439
My father taught me that self-discipline is based on behavior.

145
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,159
You must not be disrespectful in behavior or conduct.

146
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:47,359
I was able to enjoy indulging myself a little after I entered Wind Taker Institute.

147
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,679
Are you saying that Wind Taker is poor and unruly?

148
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,239
You are from a noble family.

149
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,420
I should take advantage of your hospitality.

150
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,439
Young Master, Manor Master received your letter.

151
00:10:56,439 --> 00:10:58,731
He is waiting for you in the back of the manor.

152
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,579
- Let's go.
- After you.

153
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,371
The Wuji Manor lives up to its name.

154
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:14,231
It is much more magnificent than I thought.

155
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,420
Young Master Xifan!

156
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,519
- Xifan.
- Young Master.

157
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,571
You are back.

158
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,160
Lu Ping?

159
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,200
Why have you come as well?

160
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:36,231
Nice to meet you, Uncle Yan.

161
00:11:36,231 --> 00:11:39,639
I came without your invitation. Sorry to be a bother.

162
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:42,959
Father, Lu Ping knows the Mountain and Sea Gang best.

163
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,531
I asked him to come with me to assist you.

164
00:11:46,531 --> 00:11:49,771
Since you are here, stay a few days at the manor.

165
00:11:49,771 --> 00:11:52,791
We can discuss how to fight against the Mountain and Sea Gang later.

166
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:54,631
I've already prepared dinner.

167
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:58,051
Have a few drinks with me tonight.

168
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,460
[Wuji Manor]

169
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,160
Come in.

170
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,439
Ping'er,

171
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,691
why aren't you resting early after a long day's journey?

172
00:12:25,691 --> 00:12:29,751
I come here tonight to especially thank you for your hospitality.

173
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,771
You don't need to be so courteous with me.

174
00:12:35,771 --> 00:12:39,551
Actually, I came here with a question this time.

175
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,899
Even though what happened at the Seven Stars Convention has been settled,

176
00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:46,431
but I can't get over the words left by Liu Song in the Big Dipper.

177
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,840
This is the account book left by my master in the Wind Taker Institute.

178
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,119
It seems that he had been searching for years as well,

179
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,231
but the last few pages are missing.

180
00:12:55,231 --> 00:13:00,611
I wonder if he told you anything back when he came to Wuji Manor.

181
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,439
We weren't able to rescue my eldest senior that year.

182
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,180
It has always been a sore spot for all of us

183
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,111
especially Fourth Brother Youdao.

184
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:17,531
He came to Wuji Manor to drink with me that day.

185
00:13:17,531 --> 00:13:22,831
He scolded himself for not being able to see people clearly.

186
00:13:22,831 --> 00:13:27,631
He might have already known the identity of Liu Song at that time.

187
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,611
Did he say anything else?

188
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,800
I told him...

189
00:13:35,451 --> 00:13:37,731
that the past can't be changed.

190
00:13:37,731 --> 00:13:40,011
We can only look forward to the future.

191
00:13:40,011 --> 00:13:44,120
Afterward, I heard he was searching for the Mountain and Sea Gang

192
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,530
and got you back.

193
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,500
Sometimes,

194
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:57,531
it doesn't matter what the truth is.

195
00:13:57,531 --> 00:14:01,671
What's important is that your parents sacrificed their lives to protect you.

196
00:14:01,671 --> 00:14:05,451
You became brothers with Xifan after everything by chance

197
00:14:05,451 --> 00:14:10,280
and even went back to the Big Dipper to inherit your father's legacy.

198
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:13,391
This was all fate.

199
00:14:13,391 --> 00:14:16,911
The dead are gone.

200
00:14:16,911 --> 00:14:19,951
You should cherish the present.

201
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,571
What you say is right.

202
00:14:24,571 --> 00:14:27,271
But as someone's son,

203
00:14:27,271 --> 00:14:29,671
I am not able to be filial to my parents.

204
00:14:29,671 --> 00:14:32,031
I feel very guilty.

205
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,871
Actually, I really envy Xifan.

206
00:14:35,871 --> 00:14:41,531
Having a father really does feel great.

207
00:14:41,531 --> 00:14:43,879
You're like a brother to Xifan.

208
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,831
I like you very much.

209
00:14:46,831 --> 00:14:49,071
You can take this as your home

210
00:14:49,071 --> 00:14:52,691
and treat me as your father.

211
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,671
Thank you, Uncle Yan.

212
00:14:56,671 --> 00:14:58,559
Xifan and I are brothers.

213
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,711
I will happily regard you as my father as well.

214
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,959
After I rescue Master Chu Min and get rid of the Mountain and Sea Gang,

215
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:13,231
I will always come back to Wuji Manor to accompany you.

216
00:15:13,231 --> 00:15:15,570
Okay. It's a deal.

217
00:15:16,359 --> 00:15:19,331
Liu Song hasn't made any moves lately.

218
00:15:19,331 --> 00:15:22,199
He must've found out the secret of the Thousand Pine Ruler.

219
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,171
We here at the Wuji Manor have been watching them.

220
00:15:25,171 --> 00:15:28,680
Once there is any news, we will defeat them in one blow.

221
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,380
Don't worry.

222
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:36,039
Wuji Manor and I will avenge your parents' death for you.

223
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,331
Thank you, Uncle Yan.

224
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,660
Young Master Xifan,

225
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,460
you had quite a few drinks today.

226
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:51,051
I made you some tea to help sober you up.

227
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,900
How is your injury?

228
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:12,380
Thanks to Manor Master, I have fully recovered.

229
00:16:13,191 --> 00:16:15,951
You don't have to do this stuff.

230
00:16:15,951 --> 00:16:18,519
I am used to it. It's not a big deal.

231
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,240
Ziyan,

232
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:26,211
in Wuji Manor, you are not a maid and I am not your owner.

233
00:16:26,211 --> 00:16:28,231
We are equal.

234
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:34,711
The scenery here is quite different from that in Kaifeng.

235
00:16:34,711 --> 00:16:37,060
After I get rid of the chaos of the Mountain and Sea Gang,

236
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:39,251
I'll take you traveling.

237
00:16:39,251 --> 00:16:41,560
Are you willing?

238
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,551
Yes.

239
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,531
Your parents sacrificed their lives in order to protect you.

240
00:16:54,531 --> 00:16:57,831
You became brothers with Xifan after everything by chance

241
00:16:57,831 --> 00:17:02,900
and even went back to the Big Dipper to inherit your father's legacy.

242
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,719
This was all fate.

243
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,901
The dead are gone.

244
00:17:08,901 --> 00:17:11,901
You should cherish the present.

245
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,439
You're like a brother to Xifan.

246
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,620
I like you very much.

247
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:30,351
You can take this as your home and treat me as your father.

248
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,511
Here comes the imperial edict.

249
00:17:44,511 --> 00:17:50,719
Yan Qiuci and Yan Xifan of Wuji Manor, receive the imperial edict.

250
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,131
According to His Majesty,

251
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:22,999
Princess Xining is being escorted to Wuji Manor by the Agile Dragon Army.

252
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,031
She will arrive in a few days.

253
00:18:26,031 --> 00:18:29,619
Young Manor Master, congratulations.

254
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:36,151
I'm sorry, I can't accept His Majesty's favor.

255
00:18:36,151 --> 00:18:37,871
What did you say?

256
00:18:37,871 --> 00:18:41,280
I can't accept the edict to get married.

257
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,731
How dare you refuse His Majesty's edict?

258
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,359
Please don't be angry. My son was rude.

259
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:50,451
Please forgive him.

260
00:18:50,451 --> 00:18:52,911
Can we speak somewhere else?

261
00:18:52,911 --> 00:18:54,680
After you.

262
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,039
Such a good thing!

263
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,971
He was able to get a perfectly good wife.

264
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,520
Ziyan,

265
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,271
who is Princess Xining?

266
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,571
She is…

267
00:19:21,571 --> 00:19:23,751
She is Miss Qin.

268
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:29,799
Don't go! Lu Ping, that's an imperial edict.

269
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:31,891
I don't care.

270
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,951
Do you know of Lu Ping?

271
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,891
I heard that he made contributions in Yuezhou.

272
00:19:46,891 --> 00:19:48,660
Yes.

273
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:52,760
Since the battle of Yuezhou, I believe that His Majesty has known that

274
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:56,071
Lu Ping and Princess Xining are in love.

275
00:19:56,071 --> 00:20:00,111
Lu Ping is the son of my eldest brother.

276
00:20:00,111 --> 00:20:03,071
He is the brother of my son.

277
00:20:03,071 --> 00:20:08,339
We will lose our loyalty to friends if we accept the sudden imperial edict of marriage from His Majesty.

278
00:20:08,339 --> 00:20:11,971
We will lose our loyalty to His Majesty if we don't accept.

279
00:20:11,971 --> 00:20:16,220
May I ask what the meaning is of His Majesty's arrangement?

280
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,711
His Majesty has only a phrase for you.

281
00:20:20,711 --> 00:20:23,791
Manor Master Yan is the master of the puglist world.

282
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:27,151
Who governs the pugilist world?

283
00:20:27,151 --> 00:20:30,260
Wuji Manor is located in the Northwest.

284
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:33,291
Who are you protecting?

285
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:36,691
Nowadays, the Mountain and Sea Gang is becoming more and more powerful and doing evil.

286
00:20:36,691 --> 00:20:40,919
His Majesty is marrying the princess to the Young Manor Master at this time

287
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:44,039
because he hopes that the imperial family and the pugilist world

288
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,319
will join hands to fight against their common enemy.

289
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,839
When facing a formidable enemy,

290
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:52,551
love means absolutely nothing.

291
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,039
Eunuch,

292
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:58,719
I am part of the pugilist world, but I also stand with the Shuo State.

293
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,399
If our country is in trouble, I will gladly fight.

294
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,691
Why would you need to use marriage as leverage?

295
00:21:03,691 --> 00:21:08,471
This edict will make me betray my friends and myself.

296
00:21:08,471 --> 00:21:10,260
I'm sorry I can't obey the order.

297
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,391
You…

298
00:21:12,391 --> 00:21:14,591
Who is he?

299
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,711
Eunuch, be careful.

300
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,839
The imperial edict!

301
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,359
Yan Xifan, when did I mess with you? Why are you stealing my Qin Sang?!

302
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:25,560
Lu Ping, what do you mean by this?

303
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,940
There's something wrong with all of this. Cooperate with me.

304
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,240
Eunuch.

305
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,739
- Lu Ping, that's enough!
- Eunuch.

306
00:21:29,739 --> 00:21:31,220
- You can't watch over your own woman!

307
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,820
What do you mean by starting a fight with me?!

308
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:35,079
You might feel angry, but I'm also in a bad mood!

309
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,279
You want to fight, right?

310
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,539
Come outside and fight with me!

311
00:21:37,539 --> 00:21:39,420
- Fine, let's fight. Do you think I'm afraid of you?
- Eunuch.

312
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:41,039
How dare you!

313
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:44,591
This is the imperial edict.

314
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,151
What's going on?

315
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:59,371
His Majesty is serious. This is not a normal imperial edict granting marriage.

316
00:21:59,371 --> 00:22:02,351
This an alliance agreement between the pugilist world and the imperial court.

317
00:22:02,351 --> 00:22:06,611
It's just I don't understand why His Majesty had to choose Qin Sang.

318
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:11,151
What other reason could there be? I contradicted His Majesty in Yuezhou.

319
00:22:11,151 --> 00:22:13,320
He is retaliating against me.

320
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:18,071
Qin Sang must have been forced. Right now, she must be tied to the bridal sedan chair.

321
00:22:18,071 --> 00:22:20,351
His Majesty is not someone who's so narrow-minded.

322
00:22:20,351 --> 00:22:23,571
As for Miss Qin, who can force her?

323
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,749
Don't stare off blankly. Think of a way.

324
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:30,279
- So I need to find her and ask her in person.
- Don't act rashly.

325
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:34,131
We are rivals in love right now. There's no running from that.

326
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,351
As to what to do about you and Miss Ling,

327
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:40,240
you have to figure it out by yourself.

328
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,949
Yan Xifan, I'm not finished with you!

329
00:22:43,949 --> 00:22:45,879
- Lu Ping!
- Xifan!

330
00:22:45,879 --> 00:22:47,020
Young Master!

331
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:50,989
W-What can I do now?! The edict was destroyed and he ran away!

332
00:22:50,989 --> 00:22:54,380
How… How can I report back to the palace?

333
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,980
Young Master, are you okay?

334
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,280
I am fine.

335
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:03,380
Eunuch, the pugilist world has its own rules.

336
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:06,319
If you use force, then there will definitely be trouble.

337
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,159
You can rest in the manor for a few days.

338
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:13,631
I guarantee that this matter will be settled properly.

339
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:24,211
Father, thank you for indulging in my behavior.

340
00:23:24,211 --> 00:23:26,211
Get up.

341
00:23:26,211 --> 00:23:27,460
Yes.

342
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:33,099
You are not greedy and are not afraid of imperial power.

343
00:23:33,099 --> 00:23:35,719
I understand your personality.

344
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:39,180
It happened so suddenly, I believe there must be some hidden motive.

345
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:44,199
Lu Ping should be heading to find Qin Sang right now. Hopefully, he can find out the truth.

346
00:23:44,199 --> 00:23:46,700
Don't do anything that can let those imperial officers hold something against you.

347
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:50,491
I will take care of the rest.

348
00:23:50,491 --> 00:23:52,040
Thank you, Father.

349
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:55,660
Fan'er, you have to be prepared.

350
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,470
If something goes wrong,

351
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:02,140
you can't refuse the order from His Majesty.

352
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:06,260
Wuji Manor can delay this for a while, but we can't defer forever.

353
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,740
Father, I—

354
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:12,211
All the land under Heaven belongs to the emperor.

355
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,851
No matter how you indulge yourself in the pugilist world,

356
00:24:15,851 --> 00:24:20,471
you can't go against His Majesty. Understand?

357
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,120
I understand.

358
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,160
Ziyan.

359
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,100
Ziyan.

360
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:01,379
Manor Master, the eunuch and his party have all be settled in.

361
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,721
I don't understand.

362
00:25:03,721 --> 00:25:07,711
Why are you indulging in Young Manor Master and Lu Ping's mischievousness?

363
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,591
He is my son.

364
00:25:10,591 --> 00:25:14,351
I know what is on his mind.

365
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:22,151
Marriages to the imperial court have always had more than one meaning.

366
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:28,171
I'm afraid His Majesty wants to lead the snake out of the hole by using this method.

367
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,011
Manor Master, what do you mean by this?

368
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:39,739
Back then, Eldest Brother ordered Chenfeng to seal the commander's seal in the Thousand Pine Ruler.

369
00:25:39,739 --> 00:25:43,339
Right now, Liu Song has gotten the Thousand Pine Ruler, but he can't get the commander's seal out.

370
00:25:43,339 --> 00:25:45,611
He will need to find Chenfeng.

371
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:50,371
His Majesty... is forcing me.

372
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:56,260
Ah Ze, immediately spread the news that

373
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:59,531
Lu Chenfeng has recently returned from his long trip

374
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:02,479
to the Wuji Manor.

375
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:07,139
- Master, do you really want to let the man—
- I won't unless I really have to,

376
00:26:07,139 --> 00:26:12,211
so we have to speed up our actions and seize the Thousand Pine Ruler back.

377
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:27,039
Qin Sang, what happened?

378
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:50,079
Princess, there are still 40 miles to go before we arrive at Wuji Manor. We'll arrive at dusk.

379
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:59,319
It's a marriage bestowed by His Majesty. We must show proper etiquette and follow the rules.

380
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:00,580
Yes.

381
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:05,260
♫ Wait for a gust of wind to blow  ♫

382
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:08,800
♫ the youngster's sleeves ♫

383
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:15,990
♫ Time drifts by, stopping at the dock ♫

384
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:23,520
♫ If there hadn't been an encounter, there wouldn't
evoke a sense of nostalgia ♫

385
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:30,120
♫ So carefree! ♫

386
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:34,450
♫ A streamer is chasing after the moonlight ♫

387
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:38,200
♫ Those eyes that move me, ♫

388
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:45,670
♫ float above the clouds, walk into my heart,
and stay there for a while ♫

389
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:54,400
♫ The sky, the land, the flowers, the birds, and the pavilion,
they are always waiting on their own ♫

390
00:27:54,410 --> 00:28:01,300
♫ Passing through the world, we meet by chance,
dreading the parting time ♫

391
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:38,820
♫ Looking at the cloud hiding in a forgotten corner, ♫

392
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:45,930
♫ When the thought is disturbed, I failed to catch you ♫

393
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:53,400
♫ If it weren't for the usual ups and downs, there would just be ordinary joys and sorrows of unions and separations ♫

394
00:28:53,400 --> 00:29:00,110
♫ So overflowing! ♫

395
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:03,000
♫ A streamer is chasing after the moonlight ♫

396
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,540
Where is my sword?

397
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,620
Princess.

398
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:13,159
I am from the Qin Family. I am only me when my sword is with me. I will never betray my sword even if I get married.

399
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:24,390
♫ The sky, the land, the flowers, the birds, and the pavilion,
they are always waiting on their own ♫

400
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:27,100
♫ Passing through the world, we meet by chance,
dreading the parting time ♫

401
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:32,011
This is a bodhi fruit. This is meant to help protect you.

402
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:39,500
Qin Sang, no matter what happens in the future,

403
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,631
I just want you to be safe.

404
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:04,450
♫ A streamer is chasing after the moonlight ♫

405
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:08,160
♫ So close and yet, so far! ♫

406
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:15,500
♫ It still shines and reflects on me with a thin outline ♫

407
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:24,510
♫ You are like a firework of the world and also
a passing dream traveler, ♫

408
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:31,940
♫ forever stay in my heart ♫

409
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:40,680
♫ forever stay in my heart ♫

410
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,911
Protect the princess!

411
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,479
Do you know that this a crime punishable by death?!

412
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,791
Why would I still be afraid of death at a time like this?

413
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,951
You look really nice... dressed like this today.

414
00:32:26,951 --> 00:32:31,280
You know I don't want to see you. Why did you come here?

415
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,391
I think you have the answer.

416
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,571
Otherwise, you would've stabbed me already.

417
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:46,080
I came to remind you of our promise that day.

418
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,471
I don't want you to marry Xifan.

419
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,831
I believe you don't want to either.

420
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:59,671
This is a marriage bestowed by His Majesty. It is the Qin Family's honor.

421
00:32:59,671 --> 00:33:02,311
I am also willing to do so.

422
00:33:02,311 --> 00:33:06,320
My brother is gone. Our Qin Family needs someone to depend on.

423
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:10,311
Wuji Manor is my best choice.

424
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,751
Qin Sang,

425
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,811
it's really tiring to say what you don't mean.

426
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:20,131
If you really have no feelings for me,

427
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,491
why do you keep the sword I gave you?

428
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:34,619
It's only a sword. I can pick it up and let it go.

429
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:04,900
Qin Sang, do you have any difficulties?

430
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,611
Can you tell me?

431
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:12,011
We conquered many difficulties together.

432
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,421
Am I so unreliable in your mind?

433
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,071
Also, Eldest Senior Brother has developed feelings for Miss Ling.

434
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,071
Do you really bear to force them apart?

435
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,491
Qin Sang,

436
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:35,071
Miss Ling chose her own path.

437
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:38,691
Why don't you choose one for yourself?

438
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:43,641
It's just the honor of the Qin Family.

439
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,401
I can earn it with you.

440
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,290
Qin Sang,

441
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:00,400
come back to me. Okay?

442
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,220
Lu Ping,

443
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,671
I am sorry.

444
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:32,020
Qin Sang.

445
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:02,300
Lu Ping, I'm sorry.

446
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,051
Have a good sleep.

447
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:10,811
When you wake up, everything will be fine.

448
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:21,251
If he shows signs of waking up, give him this medicine again.

449
00:36:21,251 --> 00:36:23,131
Princess, don't worry.

450
00:36:23,131 --> 00:36:27,271
The Pneuma Lock can't even be unlocked by the Pneuma of Energy.

451
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,951
Lu Ping definitely can't get out of it.

452
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:39,099
Wen Rui, personally escort him back to the Big Dipper.

453
00:36:39,099 --> 00:36:42,260
He's not allowed to leave until the Mountain and Sea Gang is destroyed.

454
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:45,560
What? Then, what about the Mountain and Sea Gang?

455
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:48,791
I can deal with the Mountain and Sea Gang with Manor Master Yan.

456
00:36:48,791 --> 00:36:50,580
I understand now.

457
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:54,890
You had planned this from the beginning, right?

458
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:58,619
This is my personal affair. It's none of your business.

459
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,959
Yes.

460
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:05,831
Why are you still here? The rest of you, hurry to Wuji Manor.

461
00:37:05,831 --> 00:37:07,080
Yes.

462
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:32,200
[After obtaining the Thousand Pind Ruler, the Mountain and Sea Gang will definitely .... We hope that Manor Master Yan can cooperate with the Princess...]

463
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:42,719
His Majesty wants to lure Liu Song to appear using Lu Chenfeng as a bait?

464
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:47,971
Yes, that is His Majesty's plan. There's no news about Liu Song right now.

465
00:37:47,971 --> 00:37:51,351
He probably hasn't been able to get the commander's seal from the Thousand Pine Ruler yet.

466
00:37:51,351 --> 00:37:55,591
We have to make a dangerous move in order to get rid of future trouble.

467
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,751
This still needs to be carefully planned.

468
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:04,099
It's been a long journey for Princess to get here. I see that it's getting late.

469
00:38:04,099 --> 00:38:07,031
You should go rest in the side courtyard first.

470
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:12,851
Master Yan, I heard Lu Chenfeng is here right now.

471
00:38:12,851 --> 00:38:14,159
Can I meet him?

472
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,479
He is not at the Wuji Manor right now.

473
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,491
He is not here?

474
00:38:18,491 --> 00:38:22,559
Chenfeng is eccentric. I've been worried about his safety all these years.

475
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:25,660
He just came back from his travels and is visiting Wuji Manor.

476
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:28,240
I arranged for him a secret place.

477
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,179
He is very safe. Please rest assured, Princess.

478
00:38:31,179 --> 00:38:32,380
Master Yan.

479
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:36,711
I know. His Majesty has foresight,

480
00:38:36,711 --> 00:38:39,531
but Chenfeng is my junior afterall.

481
00:38:39,531 --> 00:38:44,471
There are spies from the Mountain and Sea Gang around the Wuji Manor.

482
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:49,391
I know the terrain of Jin City.

483
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,651
I hope the Agile Dragon Army will cooperate with me in the future.

484
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,991
What do you think?

485
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:03,720
Princess.

486
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,870
Is there anything else, Master Yan?

487
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:10,490
Did you meet Lu Ping on the way here?

488
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,330
What?

489
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:19,740
Nothing. The two kids argued with each other over the marriage.

490
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:25,271
Lu Ping hurt Xifan and went to you.

491
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:32,131
I'm afraid that he'll be too sentimental and will ruin His Majesty's plans.

492
00:39:32,131 --> 00:39:36,691
Master Yan, don't worry. I've dealt with this properly already.

493
00:39:36,691 --> 00:39:38,711
Lu Ping is no longer in the plan.

494
00:39:38,711 --> 00:39:43,151
I've already... sent him back to the Big Dipper.

495
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Princess, you don't know how arrogant Wuji Manor is.

496
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,919
The Young Manor Master actually refused the imperial edict. Now, they keep shirking again and again.

497
00:39:58,919 --> 00:40:02,071
I think they are playing tricks.

498
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,611
What tricks? Are you afraid I can't get married?

499
00:40:07,611 --> 00:40:09,551
I will keep my mouth shut.

500
00:40:09,551 --> 00:40:11,659
- Leave.
- Yes.

501
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,060
Someone.

502
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,060
- Princess.
- Pass down this order.

503
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:29,611
Place guards all around Wuji Manor and be ready to fight.

504
00:40:29,611 --> 00:40:30,860
Yes.

505
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:39,691
Where is Yan Qiuci hiding Lu Chenfeng?

506
00:40:39,691 --> 00:40:44,879
Young Manor Master, the princess has arrived to Wuji Manor. Young Hero Lu is not with her.

507
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:51,060
I got it.

508
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:54,491
Manor Master has arranged for Princess to rest in the side courtyard.

509
00:40:54,491 --> 00:40:59,811
Master ordered that he knows you need time, but you only have at most until tomorrow morning.

510
00:40:59,811 --> 00:41:03,131
Young Manor Master of Wuji Manor can't keep trying to escape reality.

511
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,850
I had already decided to follow you all my life

512
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:32,550
after being saved by you many times.

513
00:41:32,551 --> 00:41:35,020
However, His Majesty suddenly granted marriage to you.

514
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:39,199
I don't want you to get involved in it and become enemies with Lu Ping.

515
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:41,011
I'm going to be selfish.

516
00:41:41,011 --> 00:41:45,291
I definitely don't want to see you marry someone else and live unhappily.

517
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:50,931
If you're willing to get out of this mess, then tonight at midnight,

518
00:41:50,931 --> 00:41:53,711
I will be waiting for you outside of the manor.

519
00:41:53,711 --> 00:41:58,800
Since then, I've been wiling to follow you wherever you go and stay with you forever.

520
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:15,359
You didn't stay well in the tree but fell here instead.

521
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:22,111
Do you have no one who cares or to depend on either, where you're just a nuisance everywhere,

522
00:42:22,111 --> 00:42:24,451
which is why you ended up like this?

523
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:30,580
But... why can't you be as brave as Lu Ping?

524
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:34,740
You should fight for what you want.

525
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,711
Do you understand?

526
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,820
Qin Sang. Qin Sang. Qin Sang.

527
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:34,340
Qin Sang indeed still cares about me.

528
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:36,479
You don't deserve to mention the name of the princess.

529
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:41,579
If she really didn't care about me, why did she scold me, but send you to protect me?

530
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:58,600
[Ending OST: "The Paper Boat"]
[by Zhiqian Xue — Singers: Zhiqian Xue and Kewei Yu]

531
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:04,800
♫ Waiting to be buried by the lake in the town, ♫

532
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:10,840
♫ the White Paper Boat drifting with sorrow ♫

533
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:16,700
♫ Lights on the other side of the sea ♫

534
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:25,160
♫ punched fingertips in the red water tower ♫

535
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:34,780
♫ Watch the little boat churning, laughing at the ordinariness ♫

536
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:39,000
♫ Like a kite being pulled into a low altitude, ♫

537
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:44,470
♫ I smiled to the leaving person ♫

538
00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:48,800
♫ The more spotlight, the more vivid the story ♫

539
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:53,750
♫ Laughing like the moon, ♫

540
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:58,200
♫ regretting the lighthouse broke in the waves, ♫

541
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:05,390
♫ I call the Milky Way that isolates us all, blue ♫

542
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:12,970
♫ Like a moat built under the sea, ♫

543
00:45:12,970 --> 00:45:17,700
♫ waiting for the words on the paper boat to disappear, ♫

544
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:25,000
♫ there must always be someone who doesn’t
remember listening to the other ♫

545
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:32,370
♫ Anyone who is correctly guessed will end in disfavor ♫

546
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:36,600
♫ You are particularly touched but others consider it ordinary ♫

547
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:41,860
♫ Like the author, roughly put down with a weak stroke, ♫

548
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:46,300
♫ the writing boat on the lake was just like
a paper crane in the air ♫

549
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:51,130
♫ Laughing like the moon, ♫

550
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:55,900
♫ regretting the lighthouse broke in the waves, ♫

551
00:45:55,900 --> 00:46:04,000
♫ I call the Milky Way that isolates us all, blue ♫

552
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:10,730
♫ Can a moat be built on the seabed? ♫

553
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:15,100
♫ Wipe all the words on the paper boat! ♫

554
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:22,450
♫ Please let someone not remember and don't tell another! ♫

555
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:29,650
♫ Hide the reluctance between words ♫

556
00:46:29,650 --> 00:46:34,300
♫ Unfortunately, I (you) am (are) an average author ♫

557
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:42,300
♫ No matter how you (I) describe the rest, it's unnecessary! ♫

558
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:52,700
♫ Don't describe my unfulfilled promise! ♫

559
00:46:52,700 --> 00:47:01,500
♫ Don't interpret my hidden fire-smoke! ♫

560
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:10,500
♫ Don't let the paper boat in the rough wave chasing me! ♫

561
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:19,050
♫ Don't wait until it over to know there are you and me! ♫
