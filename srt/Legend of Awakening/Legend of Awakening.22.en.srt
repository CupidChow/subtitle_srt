00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:28,890
♫ The dark green sea is hazy ♫

3
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,760
♫ dissipating in a flash. ♫

4
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:36,620
♫ Rivers and lakes divide the world. ♫

5
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:40,020
♫ Ten thousands arrows are firing at once. ♫

6
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,900
♫ Who has time to worry? Who loves the color of blood? ♫

7
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:47,740
♫ At that time, spirits are high. ♫

8
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:51,590
♫ Who calls the world his home? Who dares let his horse freely run? ♫

9
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:54,340
♫ Silently, tears form in the death of night. ♫

10
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:58,240
♫ Heroes are cutting all ties, ♫

11
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,040
♫ giving up whether it's life or death, ♫

12
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,240
♫ never asking what the cost is. ♫

13
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:09,830
♫ Good and evil must be distinguished. ♫

14
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:13,760
♫ The wind blows off the snow. ♫

15
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,630
♫ On the body, etch multiple scars, ♫

16
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:19,690
♫ wandering all over the world, ♫

17
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:25,060
♫ only wish to ask for answers from this world. ♫

18
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:29,160
♫ A teenager doesn't have to be a hero. ♫

19
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:33,060
♫ There is no need for flowers in the dream. ♫

20
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,140
♫ Destiny need not be afraid. ♫

21
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:40,670
♫ Because you have him all the way, ♫

Eldest Senior.

30
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,160
Eldest Senior!

31
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,599
Zhou Youlong will come at any time,

32
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,640
it's not safe here.

33
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,780
How could Eldest Senior know that

34
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:40,320
I had been at the Yuezhou Mansion?

35
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,560
You really are the same Lu Ping.

36
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,440
You are always so careful.

37
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:00,219
Xifan, what did the Mountain and Sea Gang offer you

38
00:03:00,219 --> 00:03:02,680
for you to betray your brothers?

39
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,100
They just reminded me that

40
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:14,400
the Wind Taker Institute was destroyed all because of you.

41
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:20,080
Only by catching and taking the Awakener back to the Mountain and Sea Gang, can the world be peaceful.

42
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,200
Eldest Senior, actually, the Mountain and Sea Gang are the ones who destroyed the Wind Taker Institute.

43
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,899
Be clear-mind! Don't be fooled by them.

44
00:03:27,899 --> 00:03:30,340
Do you think that if I wanted to catch you

45
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,880
that I wouldn't have come prepared?

46
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,039
What are you waiting for? Capture them!

47
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,680
Run quickly!

48
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:07,180
D*mn! Why does Yan Qiuci appear everywhere?

49
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,399
- Catch them!
- Hang on!

50
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,100
I don't want to get my father involved.

51
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,520
Yan Xifan, remember!

52
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:19,959
- At this moment, I am your boss!
- Is that so?

53
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:24,560
How about we argue about it in front of the chief to see whose argument is more logical.

54
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:40,499
Manor Master, the Mountain and Sea Gang haven't caught up yet, you'd better hurry up to treat it.

55
00:04:40,499 --> 00:04:42,240
Cover us!

56
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:04,399
Cocky! Arrogant!

57
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:06,620
What kind of senior are you?

58
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:09,520
You can't even distinguish right and wrong!

59
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,560
You are yelling at Xifan or yourself?

60
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,899
I should have been the one caught by the Mountain and Sea Gang, Master died because of me.

61
00:05:20,899 --> 00:05:22,810
Now, Eldest Senior is suffering because of me.

62
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:25,710
They really think that I can live in peace

63
00:05:25,719 --> 00:05:28,119
using their lives in exchange for mine.

64
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:33,120
If they hadn't created the chance for you so you could cut the third link of the Pneuma Confinement at the Big Dipper,

65
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,940
you would have died long ago in the Mountain and Sea Gang.

66
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,820
Would you even have the chance to be complaining here?

67
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,020
Elder Guo and Xinfan made their own decisions.

68
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,940
It's not for you to complain about life

69
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,960
but so you can fight back.

70
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:59,680
Xifan must have been bewitched by the Mountain and Sea Gang.

71
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:04,920
If you are not strong, how can you bring him back safely?

72
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,820
Miss Qin,

73
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,440
you comfort people so oddly.

74
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,399
We already agreed. Let's fight together!

75
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,780
Let's go to see Elder Yan.

76
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,740
Elder Yan,

77
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,560
how is your injury?

78
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,260
It's not a big deal.

79
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:47,699
Elder Yan, why did you come here all of a sudden?

80
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,340
It's a long story.

81
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:59,000
Xifan snuck into the the Mountain and Sea Gang and kept in touch with me.

82
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,399
He's the one who told me the news of Yuezhou.

83
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,000
However, I didn't expect that he was so impulsive.

84
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,620
He risked everything to assassinate a leader of the Mountain and Sea Gang

85
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:12,000
but instead, fell into their trickery.

86
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,360
I've been following him this whole way,

87
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,020
mainly to avoid any catastrophe.

88
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,660
Elder Yan,

89
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,480
Xifan went into the Mountain and Sea Gang for me.

90
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,440
I really am...

91
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,099
You guys are brothers, it's not your fault.

92
00:07:30,099 --> 00:07:33,859
It's just that I didn't think he progressed much faster in the Mountain and Sea Gang than

93
00:07:33,859 --> 00:07:38,540
in Wuji Manor and the Wind Taker Institute combined.

94
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:43,140
I knew he could use three pneumas when I fought with him.

95
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:48,160
I don't know what kind of crooked means he used to progress.

96
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,360
It's the Xi Sui method, the usual means of the Mountain and Sea Gang.

97
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,880
The reason why they plundered the people is

98
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,660
to use the Xi Sui Method from those of high cultivate levels on their travelers.

99
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:02,880
It can improve their combat power in a short amount of time.

100
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,560
I heard from Xifan before that you were

101
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,340
imprisoned in the Mountain and Sea Gang for many years.

102
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:11,460
- Is that because—
- That's right!

103
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,559
They want to use Lu Ping's innate ability of six pneumas

104
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,639
to make more martial artists for the Mountain and Sea Gang.

105
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,140
Six Pneuma Breakthrough?

106
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,360
The weapon on your hand…

107
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,880
Is it really The Horn?

108
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,839
- You got it by yourself?
- I got it in the Seven Martyrs Court at the Big Dipper.

109
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:41,129
However, I just got this weapon so I have yet trained well with it.

110
00:08:41,129 --> 00:08:45,600
Thus, just now, I almost hurt Xifan.

111
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,920
It's your own fate.

112
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,220
Indeed! It's like father, like son.

113
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,140
Elder Yan, what are you talking about?

114
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,460
What father?

115
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:03,840
Didn't Chu Min and Guo Youdao tell you the story of your birth?

116
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,000
The story of my birth?

117
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,999
What is it?

118
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,880
The weapon on your hand, is your father's unique weapon.

He was upright, honest, and had the best martial arts skill in the world.

127
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,960
He deserved the name of hero

Moreover, they could even use five pneumas with great skill.

[Seven Martyr Court]

161
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:03,240
You say that the Mountain and Sea Gang came because of me?

162
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:08,680
Back then, the Big Dipper was the most powerful in the world.

163
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,120
We opened the gates all the time.

164
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,540
Some sects would come and duel martial arts with us.

165
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:18,980
Xifan's mom was badly ill at that time so I went back home to visit.

166
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:21,840
Chu Min and Guo Youdao also went down the mountain.

167
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:26,120
The Mountain and Sea Gang came in the name of dueling martial arts.

168
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:32,160
When I hurried back, the Mountain and Sea Gang had left.

169
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:37,960
The Seven Martyr Court had beendestroyed and your parents had died.

170
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:42,900
My sixth junior Liu Song and seventh junior Liu Chenfeng had gone missing.

171
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,640
I didn't know what had happened.

172
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:50,660
We all thought you had been dead.

173
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:55,220
Was it because of this that my master left the Big Dipper

174
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,960
and Master Chu Min hid in Tianzhao?

175
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,160
We had good relationships with each other back then.

176
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,699
After your parents had died,

177
00:15:06,699 --> 00:15:09,780
no one wanted to stay here.

178
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,879
I also resigned as the master of a Peak.

179
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:16,240
I went back to my hometown and built Wuji Manor.

180
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:22,740
I've been fighting with the Mountain and Sea Gang since then because of this hatred.

181
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:26,380
- I didn't expect that—
- You didn't expect...

182
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:31,560
...didn't expect that I was taken to the Mountain and Sea Gang after I had been displaced.

183
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:36,140
What's more, my master saved me

184
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,820
but didn't tell me anything.

185
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,760
You were born with an innate talent

186
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:47,380
but your parents want you to have a smooth life.

187
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,420
I named myself Lu Ping

188
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:53,020
in the hopes that my life would be smooth.

189
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,759
I didn't expect that I would be the one with the most twists and turns in my life.

190
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,460
Second Senior Yan!

191
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,680
Why did you tell him?

192
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,959
Lu Ping is the son of Senior Brother and Sister Leng. It's the truth.

193
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:13,300
- He'll find out sooner or later.
- What?

194
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:18,020
Lu Ping... is the son of Pavilion Master Leng?

195
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,380
Calm down!

196
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,480
I have some things to tell Lu Ping.

197
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:36,040
Now, you have something to tell me?

198
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,290
You all didn't tell me anything before,

199
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:41,820
what was the reason then?

200
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:45,060
Lu Ping, trust me!

201
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:48,370
Lu Ping, the incident of the Seven Peak masters back then

202
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:53,040
- at the martial arts competition was really a mistake.
- Pavilion Master.

203
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,780
How could a martial arts competition harm people's lives?

204
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:59,520
How could a martial arts competition burn the mountains and destroy corpses?

205
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,900
How could a martial arts competition imprison me for all these years?

206
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,810
This whole thing from the beginning to the end is full of doubts.

207
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:10,640
You just said it was all a mistake.

208
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,510
Was it because you didn't want to find out the truth or because you were too scared to?

209
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:23,610
You are right! I was too scared to find out.

210
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,240
The accident that year, indeed, resulted in

211
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:33,000
the deaths or departures of the most famous Seven Peak masters in the Big Dipper.

212
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:36,140
Of course, we dared not to find out the truth.

213
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:40,300
Even if we figure it out, what could we do to fight against them?

214
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,380
So everyone in the Big Dipper knew that

215
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,840
the Mountain and Sea Gang killed my parents.

216
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,820
In order to protect yourself,

217
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:06,000
you've pretended that you didn't see or hear anything.

218
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,940
Lu Ping,

219
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:14,700
that year, Big Dipper lost a lot.

220
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,540
As the Pavilion Master,

221
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,480
I couldn't let the whole Big Dipper fall into a desperate situation.

222
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,240
I…

223
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,720
I am sorry.

224
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:33,740
I wasn't here that day, neither was Chu Min nor Guo Youdao.

225
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:37,740
The Mountain and Sea Gang went up the mountain,

226
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,959
burnt the Seven Martyr Court and killed three peak masters with another peak master is still missing.

227
00:18:40,959 --> 00:18:45,379
But you said something went wrong and no one was allowed to mention it again.

228
00:18:45,379 --> 00:18:48,399
Now, the people of the Mountain and Sea Gang have appeared in the territory of Dan.

229
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,660
Only one of the seven masters is suspected.

230
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,320
You guys are still indifferent.

231
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,810
Tell us,

232
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,439
are there family skeletons in the closet that cannot be shown?

233
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,020
Yan Qiuci, don't guess at will!

234
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:08,640
Is it me who fathom a wild guess or you who try to protect your old friend?

235
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,220
What does Uncle Yan mean by this?

236
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:15,780
I… I…

237
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:20,100
She doesn't dare to say because she doesn't dare to face it.

238
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,120
Because the most suspicious one

239
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,520
is her lover, Liu Song.

240
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,040
Impossible!

241
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,520
It couldn't have been him.

242
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:41,860
He was in charge of the mountain that day.

243
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:44,820
He was also the one who let the Mountain and Sea Gang in.

244
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:49,560
If Junior Liu is innocent, he wouldn't have done that.

245
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:53,720
So the most suspicious person can only be him.

246
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,760
Yan Qiuci!

247
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:01,100
He's already dead.

248
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:06,899
Master Chu Min, is it true what Uncle Yan just said?

249
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,260
Lu Ping.

250
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,900
Yan Qiuci! You stir up trouble with your nonsense.

251
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:19,020
You… You've gone too far.

252
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:24,680
I only want to ask one thing.

253
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:28,380
Big Dipper and the Mountain and Sea Gang have a deep feud.

254
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,400
Now, my good friend has been taken by them.

255
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,920
The Mountain and Sea Gang provoked us right outside the door of our Big Dipper.

256
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,740
Such a disgrace,

257
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:44,900
will Big Dipper take any action to take care of this?

258
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,030
Lu Ping,

259
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:56,780
this matter involves a dispute among Tan, Dan and Shuo, three states.

260
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,940
The relationship among them is complicated.

261
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:02,220
As a disciple of Big Dipper, even more so as a child of the Big Dipper…

262
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,080
- A child of the Big Dipper.
- You can't—

263
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:14,480
Where were you when my parents were killed by the Mountain and Sea Gang?

264
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,580
Where were you when the Mountain and Sea Gang endangered the world?

265
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,640
Now, they've taken my best friend.

266
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:35,140
I can't be a coward like you.

267
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,820
If you won't go,

268
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:42,360
I will.

269
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,180
Lu Ping!

270
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:50,159
If you leave… If you leave here, you are no longer a disciple of Big Dipper.

271
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:04,000
Dad. Mom.

272
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,660
I can't respect such a teacher any longer.

273
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,300
From now on,

274
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:16,180
Lu Ping and the Big Dipper will have nothing to do with each other.

275
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,360
Lu Ping!

276
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,839
Lu Ping? Lu Ping!

277
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,999
What are you doing? Stop!

278
00:22:51,999 --> 00:22:54,450
I am still in charge of the Big Dipper.

279
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:56,620
I usually indulge you.

280
00:22:56,620 --> 00:23:00,840
Today, I will never forgive anyone who wants to follow Lu Ping.

281
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,660
Go back. Go back!

282
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,260
Master Yan, you'd should go back to be the Leader of martial arts circle.

283
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:21,060
As soon as you come back, the Big Dipper becomes a mess.

284
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,200
Are you satisfied now?

285
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,520
You've caused so much trouble!

286
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,439
You think you can keep him in the dark his entire life but he was already aware of it.

287
00:23:37,439 --> 00:23:40,380
If you continued to hide it, you'd only be lying to yourself.

288
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,820
You put it so nicely.

289
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:50,939
But I think you're just trying to save your own son so you led Lu Ping to seek revenge on the Mountain and Sea Gang.

290
00:23:50,939 --> 00:23:54,260
With him around, the Mountain and Sea Gang will definitely show up.

291
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,300
Even if it is, so what?

292
00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:02,320
Little Junior Sister, what's the use of running away for half your life?

293
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,040
When you meet a real powerful enemy,

294
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:09,030
only if you can face them head-on, will the problem be solved.

295
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:13,380
Do you still need these kids to teach you that logic?

296
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,200
Old Guo,

297
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,240
you kept Lu Ping in the dark for three years.

298
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:38,640
Were you right... or wrong?

299
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:47,140

Now, many forces have gathered in Yuezhou, the situation is more complex.

Then... what should we do next?

There is someone in the Mountain and Sea Gang who has already cultivated the Pneuma of Essence to this level.

By time and distance, the Shuo group should arrive soon.

Yan Xifan, you really are arrogant these days.

Don't forget your identity!

There is one thing I want to remind you,

480
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:28,460
my identity is now significantly different than from before.

- You—
- Youlong.

482

You have to remember that Xifan is important in this operation.

483
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:41,320
Now, you should have more respect for your teammate.

A friend of mine in Yuezhou gave me an idea.

You are his and Lu Ping's weakness.

You've come all the way here, it has been wearisome for you.

Is the living arrangement at this lodging up to your expectations?

Thank you, Minister, for your hospitality.

It's worth working hard as long as it's for the stability

It's said that Tan State values etiquette.

However, at the time of the peace talks, the Deputy arrives late.

Why? Is General Xu ineffective in running the army?
