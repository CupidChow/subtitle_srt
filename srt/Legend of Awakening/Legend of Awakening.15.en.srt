00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,890
♫ The dark green sea is hazy ♫

3
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,800
♫ dissipating in a flash. ♫

4
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,660
♫ Rivers and lakes divide the world. ♫

5
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,000
♫ Ten thousands arrows are firing at once. ♫

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,940
♫ Who has time to worry? Who loves the color of blood? ♫

7
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:47,800
♫ At that time, spirits are high. ♫

8
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,680
♫ Who calls the world his home? Who dares let his horse freely run? ♫

9
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,330
♫ Silently, tears form in the death of night. ♫

10
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:58,300
♫ Silently, tears form in the death of night. ♫

11
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:02,100
♫ giving up whether it's life or death, ♫

12
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,300
♫ never asking what the cost is. ♫

13
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:09,850
♫ Good and evil must be distinguished. ♫

14
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:13,700
♫ The wind blows off the snow. ♫

15
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,630
♫ On the body, etch multiple scars, ♫

16
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:19,780
♫ wandering all over the world, ♫

17
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:25,200
♫ only wish to ask for answers from this world. ♫

18
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,240
♫ A teenager doesn't have to be a hero. ♫

19
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:33,080
♫ There is no need for flowers in the dream. ♫

20
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,300
♫ Destiny need not be afraid. ♫

21
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:40,790
♫ Because you have him all the way, ♫

22
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:44,700
♫ experienced a handful of conquests, ♫

23
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,580
♫ overcame a number of challenges. ♫

24
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,700
♫ From now on, happy and free! ♫

[Episode 15]

29
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,030
If there is a day

30
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,930
that I can break free from the Pneuma Confinement,

31
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:30,431
yet the Power of Awakening is used by them,

32
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:35,311
will I have the same end as hers?

33
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:42,900
It won't be like that! The motto of Wind Taker Institute is that no one shall be left behind.

34
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,571
As long as I'm here, I definitely won't let that kind of thing happen.

35
00:02:47,571 --> 00:02:48,980
Trust me!

36
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,330
As long as the Wind Taker Institute is here and our companions are here,

37
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:57,051
no matter what the Mountain and Sea Gang does,

38
00:02:57,051 --> 00:03:01,751
by all odds, I'll never back down or be afraid.

39
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,951
We have only a little left.

40
00:03:19,951 --> 00:03:23,379
Ice Chrysanthemum Wine is so tasteful, Master will like it very much.

41
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:25,240
Let's leave this to him.

42
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:30,611
Speaking of which, I still owe Master a "thanks".

43
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:36,171
By the way, where is Master?

44
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,140
He left?

45
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,460
He is always injured here and there,

46
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,540
and he said the clinic in Kaifeng costs too much,

47
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,531
so he wants to rest at Wind Taker Institute.

48
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,771
Did he mention anything?

49
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:03,560
He... said he would take every piece of the award from the emperor

50
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,511
back to the Wind Taker Institute.

51
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:10,759
Master is, indeed, Master.

52
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,471
From what I see, it's impossible that he will ever change.

53
00:04:13,471 --> 00:04:15,751
You can't be quiet even when you're eating.

54
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:28,419
I'm sleepy, I'll go back to bed.

55
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,240
Master Chu Min, you've known Master for many years, so you must know him the best.

56
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,159
He is a man of great wisdom. Master Chu Min!

57
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:49,931
If he's not from the Mountain and Sea Gang, then who is he?

58
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,591
What is he hiding from me?

59
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,000
Please don't look at me like that!

60
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,630
Like I said, I know nothing about it.

61
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:04,549
Ask Guo Youdao if you want to know.

62
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:06,231
Master Chu Min.

63
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,240
Fine! We are going to go back to Chenqiao Town anyway.

64
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,971
He has nowhere to hide.

65
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,651
Brother, how is Lu Ping?

66
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:34,751
If he's in trouble, are you planning to go there and rescue him by yourself?

67
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:38,139
I'm only worrying about you, who cares about him?

68
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:42,051
Lu Ping is fine, so he should be in the inn right now.

69
00:05:42,051 --> 00:05:44,851
We found the body of Wen Gecheng in the forest.

70
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,731
That's great! It's fine as long as he's safe.

71
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,271
Brother, are you okay?

72
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:56,231
You really care about him, right?

73
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:02,659
No, I don't! I just think he's someone who can become my friend.

74
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:08,231
He is someone who, sometimes, really acts like a rascal

75
00:06:08,231 --> 00:06:11,351
but sometimes he surprises me.

76
00:06:11,351 --> 00:06:15,991
His haters hate him to death while those who like him,

77
00:06:15,991 --> 00:06:19,711
they can't help but to miss him and to care about him.

78
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,830
I mean Zhao Xifan, Su Tang and Mo Lin.

79
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:26,410
They all really care about him.

80
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,260
Okay.

81
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,360
Sang'er,

82
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:40,911
have you ever told others that Wen Gecheng is the spy from the Mountain and Sea Gang?

83
00:06:40,911 --> 00:06:44,900
Except for those from the Wind Taker Institute, until now, no one else knows.

84
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:53,131
Brother, I know you regard Wen Gecheng as your soulmate.

85
00:06:53,131 --> 00:06:55,520
Yet this time you open the door to a dangerous person.

86
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,940
His Majesty shows good sense.

87
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:03,091
With clear explanations, he will definitely understand.

88
00:07:03,091 --> 00:07:06,399
What's more, Lu Ping is the champion of the competition.

89
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,751
He must be more suitable to be enrolled in Agile Dragon Army than Wen Gecheng.

90
00:07:09,751 --> 00:07:12,840
I'll accompany you to persuade him, okay?

91
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,620
All right! Then, do you plan to dress up?

92
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,140
Sure!

93
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,340
You should sleep well for a little while.

94
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,231
After you wake up, you will find

95

These are secret letters found in the Zhiwei Study.

98
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:29,420
They are all about the activities of the Mountain and Sea Gang in Shuo State.

99
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:32,671
I've investigated the people on the list.

100
00:08:32,671 --> 00:08:36,581
I'm afraid they all are spies from the Mountain and Sea Gang.

101
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,371
Burn all of these things before us.

102

As for the people on the list, continue to investigate.

103
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,740
Remember, keep it down!

104
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:51,400
His Majesty has pushed for a New Deal and supported me to hold the Pneuma Combat Convention

105
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,700
for selecting able men from humble families.

106
00:08:54,700 --> 00:09:00,651
There are many officials from distinguished family, like Xia Bojian, opposing this.

107
00:09:00,651 --> 00:09:05,911
If Wen Gecheng gives them the cause to destroy the New Deal,

108
00:09:05,911 --> 00:09:08,891
isn't this a letdown to His Majesty?

109
00:09:08,891 --> 00:09:13,611
So now we should consider the bigger picture, do you understand?

110
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,831
Sir Wen was attacked and killed by enemies.

111

I feel deeply sorrowful.

112

I shall take revenge for Sir Wen by myself.

Qin's Family produces only officials loyal to his sovereign.

This reputation can't be stained.

117

After I kill all the crafty sycophants,

118
00:09:52,931 --> 00:09:56,551

Have you found that the inn is all empty?

128

Moreover, the Agile Dragon Army is monitoring all of us, so I think something is off.

Did we make some mistakes?

Obviously, everything that is supposed to be done has been done.

Don't say, Qin Qi is also from the Mountain and Sea Gang?

Oh no! Do you remember how Wen Gecheng enrolled in the court?

133
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,920
Because of Qin Qi?

134
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,780
Exactly! It's because of Qin Qi's recommendation.

135
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:52,491
These years, Wen Gecheng has always worked for the Qin's Family.

136
00:11:52,491 --> 00:11:56,059
So it's easy to understand that he cultivates his own people and develops personal relationship in the court.

137
00:11:56,059 --> 00:11:58,571
All of these could not be done without Qin Qi's help.

138
00:11:58,571 --> 00:12:02,300
So if the fact that Wen Gecheng was the spy is exposed,

139

Qin Qi will be guilty even if he knows nothing.

and we benefit from him, by the way?

159
00:13:41,151 --> 00:13:43,071
Young Master Lu,

160
00:13:43,071 --> 00:13:47,271
you should go out right now because the gatekeepers are slackening.

161
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,591
It seems that we four will have to run for our lives again.

162
00:13:52,591 --> 00:13:56,991
I think we four are destined to be together forever.

163
00:13:56,991 --> 00:13:59,520
How about we pick up a nickname?

164
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:03,119
Then we have a group title for our future.

165
00:14:03,119 --> 00:14:07,411
How about the Forever Unkillable Four Heroes of Wind Taker?

166
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,980
What do you think?

167
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,611
It sounds so bad.

168
00:14:13,611 --> 00:14:16,519
How does it sound bad? I think it's very powerful.

169
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:21,199
Miss Ling, what about you? What do you plan on doing in the future?

170
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,559
Right! You helped us this time.

171
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:25,871
Qin Qi won't forgive you.

172
00:14:25,871 --> 00:14:28,191
I'll find a way to live.

173
00:14:28,191 --> 00:14:31,300
With such a humble life, I don't deserve your worry.

174
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,300
Miss Ling,

175
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:37,331
you can come with us to Wind Takers if you're willing to.

176
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,451
You can live a new life!

177
00:14:39,451 --> 00:14:42,360
Can… Can I?

178
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:46,071
Wind Taker Institute is a simple place but we live as we please.

179
00:14:46,071 --> 00:14:50,971
Didn't Miss Ling teach me that the hardest part is to let go?

180
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,651
We should still hurry up to leave.

181
00:14:55,651 --> 00:14:57,180
Let's go!

182
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,900
- Miss Ling.
- Miss Ling.

183
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,800
- Miss Ling.
- Miss Ling.

184
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,480
Miss Ling!

185
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,811
Young Master Lu,

186
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:57,051
I don't have the time to live again.

187
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,831
Miss Ling!

188
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,091
Why did you kill her?

189
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,931
She's just an ordinary lady.

190
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:28,871
She's neither your soldier nor your enemy.

191
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,951
It's my family's affair.

192
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:37,511
Some people are meant to die by my hands

193
00:16:37,511 --> 00:16:40,111
so they don't have a chance to flee.

194
00:16:40,111 --> 00:16:44,600
Qin Qi, you confuse right and wrong.

195
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,900
Do you know what the rules are and what fairness is?

196
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:50,491
You killed an important official in the broad daylight.

197
00:16:50,491 --> 00:16:52,299
That's what the rules are and what fairness is.

198
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,700
You...

199
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:59,500
Lu Ping, I figured you have something to do with the Mountain and Sea Gang.

200
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,239
How about this? I'll give you another chance.

201
00:17:02,239 --> 00:17:05,680
You quietly come back with me and help me to investigate.

202
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:09,309
You can be forgiven this time because you are a friend of Sang'er.

203
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:11,820
Bah! Such a sour smell!

204
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:14,521
I can even smell it three li away. (TN: 1 li = 1/3 mile = 1/2 km)

205
00:17:14,521 --> 00:17:18,359
There should be someone to bear the crime of the Pneuma Combat Convention.

206
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:21,001
Lu Ping, you can't trust him.

207
00:17:21,001 --> 00:17:22,611
I'll go with you

208
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,810
but you must let them go.

209
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:28,761
I'm not here to negotiate.

210
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,260
Su Tang,

211
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,291
I hid for so many years.

212
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,271
Today, I want to fight for Wind Taker.

213
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,591
Brother, I have your back.

214
00:18:09,591 --> 00:18:13,360
Might as well! Fighting to death is delightful.

215
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,500
General Qin, listen carefully.

216
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:22,131
We, Wind Taker disciples, have nothing

217
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,351
but a strong backbone.

218
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,400
Fine!

219
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,159
- Agile Dragon Army.
- Yes!

220
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:42,791
Lu Ping killed a royal official, so he's meant to die.

221
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:45,540
Others are his accomplices.

222
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:48,240
- Carry out the execution on the spot.
- Yes.

223
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,800
Fire the arrows!

224
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:36,480
Senior, Miss Ling, she...

225
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,611
You are way too kind.

226
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:41,540
Why care about a dead body when you are in danger?

227
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:45,151
Will you carry the when you are on the run?

228
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,451
Why do you always appear at the critical moment?

229
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,751
Why do you always rescue me at the risk of your life?

230
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,540
Dao. (TN: A thief)

231
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,791
Who are you?

232
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,431
Don't you think he's very familiar?

233
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,231
Like a shadow,

234
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,820
he's watching us all the time.

235
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,500
Now he's trying to distract Qin Qi for us.

236
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,711
With such profound martial arts, he knows how to escape.

237
00:20:50,711 --> 00:20:53,620
We can't stay here for too long, we'd better go.

238
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:56,251
Don't let him down!

239
00:20:56,251 --> 00:21:00,271
We shall finally meet if our destinies are meant for us to be together.

240
00:21:00,271 --> 00:21:02,071
I'll check the horses.

241
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,471
Brother, where are we going?

242
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,871
Qin Qi will surely try to find us.

243
00:21:10,871 --> 00:21:12,911
The four of us together are easy to spot.

244
00:21:12,911 --> 00:21:14,640
We shall not be together.

245
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,439
You should go north with Mo Lin and find a safe place to hide.

246
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,760
How about you? Are you going to leave alone without me?

247
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,839
Lu Ping, what are you doing?

248
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,319
She's your sister and now you abandon her.

249
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:29,119
- Mo Lin, don't mess things up!
- I won't leave.

250
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:32,971
Eldest Senior once said, no one in Wind Taker Institute shall be left behind.

251
00:21:32,971 --> 00:21:34,500
Su Tang,

252
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,391
after eating this candy,

253
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,931
it'll be time to grow up and be obedient.

254
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,039
Brother, I won't eat candies any more.

255
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:48,559
You can take me with you, I can certainly fight with you.

256
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:52,471
You've promised that you'll always take me with you because you saved my life.

257
00:21:52,471 --> 00:21:54,411
In the Mountain and Sea Gang,

258
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,720
I would have had no courage to live

259
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,751
if it wasn't for you.

260
00:22:00,751 --> 00:22:02,571
It isn't I who saved you,

261
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,231
it's you who rescued me.

262
00:22:05,231 --> 00:22:07,559
- Brother.
- Listen to me!

263
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:09,020
Mo Lin,

264
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,551
I entrust my sister to you.

265
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,291
Please take good care of her.

266
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:17,580
Don't let anything bad happen to her.

267
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,680
Don't worry!

268
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,751
I swear on the name of Number One Assassin,

269
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,679
that I'll take good care of her.

270
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,631
All right! It's a deal, then.

271
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,700
Go!

272
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,400
Brother.

273
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,900
Where are you going?

274
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:56,460
I want to go back to the Wind Taker Institute to see how things are.

275
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:59,271
If everything's all right, I'll go find Su Tang.

276
00:22:59,271 --> 00:23:01,191
It's such a big world.

277
00:23:01,191 --> 00:23:03,271
We should be able to find a place to settle.

278
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,080
It's exactly what I'm thinking.

279
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,740
How about we go together?

280
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:14,691
With you by my side, I'll feel so at ease.

281
00:23:14,691 --> 00:23:16,231
Of course, you are.

282
00:23:16,231 --> 00:23:20,291
- Like I said, the Wind Taker Institute—
- won't leave any single one behind.

283
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,540
Master, I'm afraid they will soon find out about our information.

284
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:32,460
[Wei Residence]
I'll pack and take some money to see you and Young Master off.

285
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:36,760
Father, aren't we already back at home so why do we have to leave again?

286
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:40,359
I heard from Sangsang that Wen Gecheng works for the Mountain and Sea Gang.

287
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,119
But what does this have to do with us?

288
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:45,520
Why are you so timid that we have to rush back home overnight?

289
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,619
- It's…
- What happened?

290
00:23:47,619 --> 00:23:49,560
- It's…
- Young Master,

291
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,959
if it wasn't you who leak out the identity of Wen Gecheng,

292
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,731
he wouldn't have died.

293
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,291
What does that have to do with me?

294
00:23:56,291 --> 00:24:00,939
Enough! I have some trouble so we need to hide somewhere for a while.

295
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:04,491
Whatever may come, I won't let you be hurt.

296
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,871
Mountain and Sea Token?

297
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,380
Father, what's going on?

298
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,220
- When did you start to work for the Mountain and Sea Gang?
- Stop talking!

299
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,591
Why is it so noisy?

300
00:24:32,591 --> 00:24:35,979
Be quiet! Otherwise, I'll pull out your front teeth and cut off your tongue.

301
00:24:35,979 --> 00:24:37,500
Please don't, Chief!

302
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:41,211
I'll do whatever you ask me to do.

303
00:24:41,211 --> 00:24:44,591
I just beg you to let my son go.

304
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:49,991
To fight such a coward and smear my own hands.

305
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,391
Chief sent me here to find Lu Ping.

306
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:03,591
But the officials has been tracking him down on a large scale

307
00:25:03,591 --> 00:25:06,020
which makes it harder for me to take actions.

308
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:09,599
So Wei, you should help me.

309
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:12,930
Chief, Lu Ping is on run.

310
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:15,950
I'm afraid he won't cooperate.

311
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:22,380
Father, save me! I don't want to die, Father.

312
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:25,220
I don't want to die, Father.

313
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:28,111
I'll go. I'll go.

314
00:25:28,111 --> 00:25:33,271
Before tomorrow noon, if you can't bring Lu Ping back,

315
00:25:33,271 --> 00:25:38,111
I'll take out your son's front teeth.

316
00:25:38,111 --> 00:25:41,139
I'll go! I'll go! That's a deal!

317
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:43,271
That's a deal!

318
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,891
Can you guess when Eldest Senior will come back?

319
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,611
You only care about Eldest Senior.

320
00:26:00,611 --> 00:26:02,320
We have the God of Bandits.

321
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,099
Exactly!

322
00:26:04,099 --> 00:26:08,639
I think they are coming back on a large sedan chair carried by eight people.

323
00:26:08,639 --> 00:26:11,819
At least, we, Wind Takers, won the competition.

324
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,980
- Exactly.
- Right.
- The champion.

325
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:16,739
- The champion.
- Right.

326
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:21,739
Master, the Mountain and Sea Gang won't take no for an answer.

327
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:24,160
Even if you threaten Lu ping with Wind Takers to catch him,

328
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,800
the Chief still won't just let us go.

329
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,300
Or maybe we should fight until the last breath, we might earn another chance.

330
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,640
Wei Ming, you've been with me for a long time.

331
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,660
I know you are considerate but we are not comparable to the Mountain and Sea Gang.

332
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:38,020
Tianqi is my only son, I shall never put him at risk.

333
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:40,239
- Master.
- Do it!

334
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,280
Advance!

335
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,791
That's our dinner.

336
00:27:16,791 --> 00:27:19,620
Eldest Senior, do you know the meaning of fleeing?

337
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:24,319
We can't appear during daytime, we can't live in the inn, and we definitely can't be picky.

338
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:26,320
The fire is an obvious target.

339
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,039
We are out of town now, enemies could be anywhere.

340
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:32,071
If you don't even know this simple thing,

341
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:40,411
for so many years, how did you live your life?

342
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:51,200
When you fled from the Mountain and Sea Gang, you were caught because of fire.

343
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:56,361
Don't mention such things! I already got to Chenqiao Town.

344
00:27:56,361 --> 00:28:00,780
Qin Qi is not there yet, so it's temporarily safe.

345
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:03,380
Then, why don't we go back to Wind Takers directly?

346
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,411
In the eyes of Xiaochun, Shitou, and them all,

347
00:28:08,411 --> 00:28:11,419
we are still the big heroes who are the winners at the Pneuma Combat Convention.

348
00:28:11,419 --> 00:28:14,500
Don't you want them to be proud of us a bit longer?

349
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,980
You are afraid of indicating them.

350
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:24,131
We, disciples of Wind Taker Institute, will never leave a compatriot alone.

351
00:28:24,131 --> 00:28:27,911
We'll rest till the small hours and then go back.

352
00:28:27,911 --> 00:28:31,220
When we return back to Wind Takers, there'll be someone who understands us.

353
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:34,211
Don't you think that I have dragged you down?

354
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:39,351
You behave like a son from a noble family

355
00:28:39,351 --> 00:28:43,250
but now you are exposed to all the dangers with me, braving the wind and dew,

356
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:45,680
eating only cold food.

357
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,351
I got used to all this.

358
00:28:55,351 --> 00:29:00,351
Lu Ping, believe me! I'll surely find someone to help us.

359
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,320
- You!
- It's from Ruyu House.

360
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,420
I did not steal this, I left Boss Jin a note.

361
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,851

Lu Ping, if you want to see your compatriots alive,

364
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:15,371
come to Wind Taker Institute alone, right now!

365
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,400
Eldest Senior,

366
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,511
it's time to go back.

367
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:42,931
Can Master Wei only come up with such a conventional method?

368
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:50,260
For us, drifters in the pugilist world, death is no big deal,

369
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,370
yet we should still try to be alive.

370
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:56,280
You must die if you fight against the Mountain and Sea Gang.

371
00:30:56,280 --> 00:31:00,091
Fighting for life is better than kneeling down and begging for mercy in front of evil people.

372
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:03,340
You and Master Wei have been controlled by the Mountain and Sea Gang for so many years.

373
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:07,340
Trusted aids are eliminated when they finish their mission, do you really not understand?

374
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:11,680
You don't understand! No one can escape from Mountain and Sea Gang alive.

375
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,431
I already came back here alive.

376
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,000
Don't you see?

377
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,111
Your life is in your own hands.

378
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:24,740
As long as you want to,

379
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:27,511
you are free from anybody's control.

380
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,559
General, the officials of Chan State already received the order of arresting.

381
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:44,751
They have been searching all over the city but still without any result.

382
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,820
If it's not because of the Blackman,

383
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:51,231
we wouldn't need to drag so many people to catch them.

384
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:54,860
Tell them to pay more attention, we go directly to Wind Taker Institute.

385
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,480
Wind Taker Institute?

386
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,391
General, I don't think they will go back.

387
00:31:59,391 --> 00:32:02,540
They value their relationships with compatriots more than their own lives.

388
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:05,239
When something bad happen, they surely will go back.

389
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:08,711
I can see you cherish their talents.

390
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,740
They are just lacking due to their consideration.

391
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:14,020
But it's all too late to talk about these things now.

392
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:20,079
If the lost of Wen Gecheng is known, Xia Bojian's group will fight against the Pneuma Combat Convention.

393
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:24,391
By then, His Majesty will be let down.

394
00:32:24,391 --> 00:32:28,340
Considering the big picture, just let me be the bad guy.

395
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,671
I'll find a chance to ask for His Majesty's punishment.

General, news from Chan State.

397

Zhao Xifan and his companion have been found in Chan State City.

398
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,680
- They are going to Wei's Residence.
- Wei's Residence?

399
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,759

- Lu Ping, are you okay?

Father, I don't understand! Why did you cooperate with the Mountain and Sea Gang?

- Isn't it better if we just keep our own family?

♫ the White Paper Boat drifting with sorrow. ♫

♫ Lights on the other side of the sea ♫
