[Legend of Awakening]

27
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:22,320
[Episode 6]

28
00:02:23,859 --> 00:02:28,880
Miss Qin, the Qin family is from an aristocratic clan.

29
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,819
Instead of enjoying a luxurious life,

30
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:34,919
you're in pursuit of Mountain and Sea Gang, and having a hard time here.

31
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:44,760
I still remember the scene where all the Phoenix Ridge Gang were killed.

32
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:52,180
After my parents passed away, I wouldn't listen to my brother.

33
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,639
So I've been wandering around the world.

34
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:00,300
As people always say, "Pay your own debts."

35
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,140
If I hadn't been so arrogant,

36
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:07,579
Phoenix Ridge Gang would never have been destroyed.

37
00:03:07,579 --> 00:03:09,999
Thus, I have to get to the bottom of this.

38
00:03:09,999 --> 00:03:11,959
I owe them that.

39
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,719
Miss Qin certainly do have noble aspirations.

40
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:21,739
But aspiration doesn't work on dead people.

41
00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:23,579
I won't be deceived by you again this time.

42
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:26,638
In the martial arts tower, the mechanisms are specifically designed.

43
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,740
There will be no casualties.

44
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:33,539
You saw what Wei Tianqi did to us.

45
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:37,439
Can you be certain that he won't rig the mechanisms?

46
00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:47,299
Why didn't you say so earlier?

47
00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:49,100
Don't worry, Miss Qin!

48
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,400
My life is far more critical than yours.

49
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,600
I don't have much time.

50
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:01,160
Lu Ping, you have to get out of there.

51
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:05,879
After one joss stick is burned, not even God can save you.

52
00:04:51,379 --> 00:04:53,759
I think this mechanism is controlled by its engine.

53
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,779
As long as we destroy that part, we can get out of here.

54
00:04:57,619 --> 00:04:59,559
I can use my Pneuma of Strength.

55
00:04:59,559 --> 00:05:02,370
Doesn't your family's sword skills include the Pneuma of Vision?

56
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:07,939
See if you can see through how it works and try to stop it.

57
00:05:19,299 --> 00:05:23,778
I can't! I'm not as good as my brother, I can't see through it.

58
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:27,879
You can't?

59
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:29,379
Forget it then.

60
00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:31,399
What do you mean forget it?

61
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,359
What are you doing?

62
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:38,440
There's only you and me in the last moments of our lives.

63
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,799
What else can we do?

64
00:05:39,799 --> 00:05:43,100
Now that I look at you, you're actually quite pretty.

65
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:47,419
If we couldn't sleep together, isn't it astonishing if we could die together?

66
00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:49,519
You... Bully!

67
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:51,439
I'm taking my clothes off.

68
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:55,959
Even if I had to die, I would never die with someone like you.

69
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,140
I see it!

70
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,900
Miss!

71
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,000
Miss, are you wounded?

72
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:39,119
Oh no!

73
00:06:39,119 --> 00:06:41,360
The Pneuma Confinement is unleashed.

74
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,320
I have merely one joss stick of time to use the Pneuma of Strength.

75
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:48,459
If I keep this on with Qin Sang, it would be too late.

76
00:06:48,459 --> 00:06:51,938
I have to come up with a plan to force her to protect me.

77
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:02,079
Young Master Lu...Your clothes...

78
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:07,660
Don't look at me like that!

79
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,959
If I didn't do this, you wouldn't unleash your power,

80
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:12,250
and we would've been buried underground.

81
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,780
You have a sly nature.

82
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,159
Who knows what else goes on inside your brain?

83
00:07:17,159 --> 00:07:18,839
Fine!

84
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:22,219
How about this? Let's make a deal.

85
00:07:22,219 --> 00:07:27,760
I wish to obtain the Tianying Stone in order to be accepted in the Pneuma Combat Convention.

86
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,179
You may stay and watch over me.

87
00:07:30,179 --> 00:07:35,199
If someone from Mountain and Sea Gang tries to contact me, I will be at your mercy.

88
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:40,000
But in order to obtain the Tianying Stone, I need you to help me.

89
00:07:42,299 --> 00:07:44,700
Are you setting me up?

90
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,878
If I wished to do that, you would've been dead.

91
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:50,039
Why would I put myself through so much?

92
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,599
Ziyan, keep an eye on Wei Tianqi.

93
00:07:58,599 --> 00:08:00,298
Make sure he doesn't cause any more trouble.

94
00:08:00,298 --> 00:08:02,659
And I will be watching this delinquent.

95
00:08:02,659 --> 00:08:05,760
- Who knows what he is up to?
- Yes, Miss.

96
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,260
Please take care!

97
00:08:09,059 --> 00:08:12,060
And you too, Young Master Lu.

98
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,058
Listen to me carefully!

99
00:08:18,058 --> 00:08:22,638
From this very moment, you are not allowed to leave my sight, nor talk to me.

100
00:08:22,638 --> 00:08:26,100
You and I are suspect and supervisor.

101
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,350
If you truly are from Mountain and Sea Gang,

102
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:32,190
I shall use my Kuiying Sword on you.

103
00:08:32,199 --> 00:08:35,960
Sure, Lady Qin.

104
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,479
Did you get his identity?

105
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:47,849
Master, his name is Lu Ping and he's from the Wind Taker Institute.

106
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,940
I have been watching him inside the tower.

107
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,559
That man is more than what he seems.

108
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:01,120
Besides, he is the one Young Master Wei is looking for.

109
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,180
If he is the mysterious man who met with Miss Qin at Ruyu House that day,

110
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,299
everything would makes sense.

111
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:15,160
Who would've known this man is right under our noses...

112
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,690
Lu Ping is now at the top of the tower.

113
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:19,210
Our men have been stationed around the martial arts tower.

114
00:09:19,219 --> 00:09:22,190
We can make a move once the other disciples are out.

115
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:26,910
- But there's one thing... I don't know if I should tell you.
- Say it!

116
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:30,539
Don't you have to keep him alive for His Lord?

117
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:35,399
This man killed Xing Luo.

118
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:37,699
We're out of his league.

119
00:09:37,699 --> 00:09:41,838
We can only take his life by using the mechanisms in the martial arts tower.

120
00:09:41,838 --> 00:09:43,820
Sacrifice him to avenge for His Lord.

121
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:47,179
Only then, would His Lord spare our lives.

122
00:09:47,179 --> 00:09:49,859
Give the order! Do it.

123
00:09:49,859 --> 00:09:52,559
I appoint you as the commander, no mistake is allowed.

124
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:54,130
Yes.

125
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:10,700
The smell inside the tower is not normal.

126
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:14,900
Some of them went in and some of them head out.

127
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:15,959
Don't take me back!

128
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,659
- Let's go, Young Master.
- We have to, Young Master.

129
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:19,160
- I'm not done yet.
- Young Master.

130
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,019
Master ordered that, when the time is right, we must leave.

131
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:25,118
- I want my revenge!
- Let's just go, Young Master.

132
00:10:25,118 --> 00:10:26,640
Wei Tianqi?

133
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,990
Why is he taken away by his own men?

134
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,738
This is not right. It's a trap!

135
00:10:46,899 --> 00:10:48,799
Eldest Senior!

136
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:50,600
Mo Lin? Why are you here?

137
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,800
Did you guys defeat Wei Tianqi?

138
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,359
We defeated others from downstairs.

139
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:58,939
But the Wei Guards seem to have been ordered to take Wei Tianqi away.

140
00:10:58,939 --> 00:11:01,878
The exam isn't complete, how could they throw their honor away?

141
00:11:01,878 --> 00:11:04,159
Unless their lives are at stake.

142
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:07,800
I smelled some men with an unknown identity outside the tower.

143
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,258
They had weapons in their hands, so this can't be good!

144
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,518
Chun, take everyone with you.

145
00:11:14,518 --> 00:11:16,660
And, get the Master of Chan State Academy over here as fast as you can.

146
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:17,940
Yes.

147
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,458
Su Tang, Mo Lin and I will go up to find Lu Ping.

148
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:24,240
I'm afraid he is the target at the exam.

149
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:28,200
Maybe your judgment is wrong.

150
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,839
Wind Taker Institute isn't a popular organization.

151
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:33,419
Maybe, it's that the Chan State Academy is coming for you.

152
00:11:33,419 --> 00:11:35,670
This exam concerns the qualifications of Pneuma Combat Convention.

153
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,770
It's the goal of every martial arts disciple.

154
00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:40,420
But the guys at the academy have all dropped out.

155
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:43,280
It shows how powerful the man behind the scene is.

156
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,358
I'm afraid they're scared of what Lu Ping can do.

157
00:11:45,358 --> 00:11:49,739
So they deliberately lured him here, to finish him using the terrain and the mechanisms in the tower.

158
00:11:49,739 --> 00:11:52,818
The closer you are to the top, the fewer people there will be and the higher their chances are.

159
00:11:52,818 --> 00:11:56,779
So to speak, the biggest trap is at the rooftop.

160
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,100
I'm going with you!

161
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,698
You're Miss Qin's maid, what are you doing here?

162
00:12:03,698 --> 00:12:05,959
Miss Qin is with Young Master Lu at the moment.

163
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:07,719
I heard everything you said.

164
00:12:07,719 --> 00:12:11,839
She will also be in danger if something happens to him. Just follow me!

165
00:12:13,419 --> 00:12:14,798
Wait, wait, wait! Wait for me!

166
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:17,559
- Tianqi!
- Master.

167
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,280
- What happened?
- Father!

168
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,220
Why did you have them bring me back?

169
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:31,779
I haven't finished the test yet! I didn't lose to Lu Ping and I still want to put Wind Takers in their place!

170
00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:34,580
Get Young Master back to his room and lock the door!

171
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:37,080
He will not leave his room until the exam is over!

172
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,719
- Yes.
- Yes.

173
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:43,340
Father, what is going on?

174
00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:51,480
My boy, behave and stay home!

175
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,158
Don't you go out and mess around.

176
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:58,579
Your life, my life, and the lives of our entire family are depending on it.

177
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,739
I thought you were good at what you do.

178
00:13:25,739 --> 00:13:28,078
But why do I feel like you've weakened?

179
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:33,179
If Lady Qin is here, how can my poor technique even be noticed?

180
00:13:34,699 --> 00:13:36,440
Miss Qin.

181
00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:40,458
I don't know who you really are but a girl has to have her leverage.

182
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:44,020
I will give it back to you once I find out your identity.

183
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:03,038
Why is there another mechanism? Lu Ping, what is happening?

184
00:14:03,038 --> 00:14:06,940
This isn't the exam! Someone is coming for us.

185
00:14:11,659 --> 00:14:16,078
This cage is made by meteoric iron, not even my Kuiying Sword can cut it loose!

186
00:14:31,999 --> 00:14:34,579
How can his Pneuma of Strength suddenly be so strong?

187
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:43,400
I've seen that chain before.

188
00:14:45,859 --> 00:14:49,939
What is it? Who are you?

189
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:58,320
No matter who I am, I cannot die here.

190
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,378
I'll hold it myself! You guys go get them out!

191
00:15:22,659 --> 00:15:23,920
- Big Brother!
- Miss!

192
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,560
- Su Tang.
- Ziyan.

193
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,118
Su Tang, this is meteoric iron.

194
00:15:32,118 --> 00:15:35,099
Even Pneuma of Strength cannot break it, let me think of something else.

195
00:15:35,099 --> 00:15:36,960
Get out of here with Eldest Senior.

196
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,390
Without me, I don't think the guys at Mountain and Sea Gang will go after you.

197
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:41,879
- Big Brother!
- Listen to me, shut up!

198
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:46,678
I brought you all in here and I am bringing everyone out! No one from Wind Taker's will be left behind!

199
00:16:08,099 --> 00:16:11,458
Here it is! I think this remedy can burn the meteoric iron.

200
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:13,940
- Step back.
- Step aside.

201
00:16:42,659 --> 00:16:43,940
Big Brother.

202
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:48,359
Assassin boy, your time management is spot on.

203
00:16:48,359 --> 00:16:53,319
One joss stick of time! Not one second more, not one second less.

204
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,278
There is something wrong with your tower! Eldest Senior might be in danger!

205
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:04,980
You have to open that tower now!

206
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:09,379
You uneducated kid... It's true that you don't know how this works.

207
00:17:09,379 --> 00:17:14,099
Listen to me! This is the exam, we will never open the tower in advance.

208
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,100
Eldest Senior and Senior Sister Su Tang are both in there.

209
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:19,479
Even the stubborn Lu Ping is one of our brothers.

210
00:17:19,479 --> 00:17:22,158
If you don't open the tower now, the Wind Takers will never let this go!

211
00:17:22,158 --> 00:17:23,199
We won't let this go!

212
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,239
- Open the tower!
- Open it now!

213
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,690
- Open it!
- We won't leave you alone!

214
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,298
Your skin is slit open. It's as if you don't feel anything at all.

215
00:17:35,939 --> 00:17:39,319
Is everyone in Wind Taker Institute a lunatic who doesn't feel pain?

216
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:43,549
Brother, why didn't you leave?

217
00:17:43,549 --> 00:17:46,820
Why did you have to drag Eldest Senior in here with us?

218
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:50,920
I was probably infected by the guy who only knows how to carry rocks.

219
00:17:51,699 --> 00:17:56,149
Don't worry! Even if I become crippled, I won't blame it on you.

220
00:17:56,149 --> 00:18:02,520
Shouldn't you clearly explain to me what exactly the chain on Lu Ping's body is?

221
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:07,480
Miss Qin, I don't have the answer to your question.

222
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,370
The most important thing is leaving together.

223
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:13,610
I'm sure the reason why he didn't leave is because he believes that,

224
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:18,020
if we do this together, it will be better than fighting alone.

225
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:28,099
Miss, I hear noises outside.

226
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:33,210
Perhaps, Chun brought the Master Wei here.

227
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:37,198
Wind Taker's disciples are in there, too, Lu Ping is not the only one inside.

228
00:18:37,198 --> 00:18:40,899
Don't worry! Since the Killing Dragon Stone was dropped, no one can escape.

229
00:18:40,899 --> 00:18:44,279
Once we set out the Hypnotic Smoke, we can then go inside.

230
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:49,739
As Master said, we only keep Lu Ping alive, the rest are doomed to die.

231
00:18:49,739 --> 00:18:51,499
Set the smoke!

232
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,719
Oh no! I smell Hypnotic Smoke.

233
00:19:05,459 --> 00:19:07,780
This place doesn't even have rat holes.

234
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:10,690
How much more unlucky can I be with you guys at my side?

235
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:16,900
What about the top of the tower? That is the weakest spot of the entire tower.

236
00:19:18,339 --> 00:19:22,079
Mo Lin, can you use your silver needle on me again to gain me one more joss stick of time?

237
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:24,438
It's useless! You're used to the pain.

238
00:19:24,438 --> 00:19:27,599
My needle can't stimulate your veins anymore.

239
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:38,019
Don't come close!

240
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:44,340
Disturbances in the three realms are like a burning mansion.

241
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:48,180
Only the invincible Mountain and Sea Gang can tide you over.

242
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,420
Miss Qin, you should just give in.

243
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:53,940
You really are one of them...

244
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,260
Big Brother!

245
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:59,190
Don't go! Trust your brother.

246
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,919
Then why did you save me?

247
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:05,559
His Lord was interested in your abilities.

248
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:09,080
He knows the only way to have you, is to lure you in.

249
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:13,680
Do you know how Mountain and Sea Gang deal with prisoners?

250
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,450
They drain every single drop of blood

251
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:20,310
and scrape every single bone of your body.

252
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:24,738
They'll show you the only thing you'll ever feel in this world is pain.

253
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:30,290
You should be happy that your guys at Phoenix Ridge Gang are all dead.

254
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:32,470
No more suffering!

255
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:36,000
If it was you, how long can you hold on?

256
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,580
Shut up!

257
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:48,210
Brother!

258
00:20:52,899 --> 00:20:55,599
Thanks, Silly!

259
00:21:00,379 --> 00:21:04,449
He's crazy! He's using Qin Sang's sword to stimulate his veins.

260
00:21:04,449 --> 00:21:06,719
He's fighting against the Pneuma Confinement.

261
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:41,639
I think there's one Pneuma Confinement missing in his body.

262
00:22:22,619 --> 00:22:24,199
- They're out!
- They're here!

263
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,100
Eldest Senior is out!

264
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,718
- Eldest Senior!
- Eldest Senior!

265
00:22:54,718 --> 00:22:56,060
Are you okay?

266
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,470
My tower!

267
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:59,160
Senior Brother, what happened? Are you hurt?

268
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,219
Move!

269
00:23:01,219 --> 00:23:03,440
What on earth did you do?

270
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,058
Didn't Headmaster make it clear?

271
00:23:05,058 --> 00:23:10,239
The person who obtains the Tianying Stone and gets out the tower first wins the exam.

272
00:23:10,239 --> 00:23:13,370
I, Lu Ping of the Wind Taker Institute,

273
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,720
retrieved it!

274
00:23:17,419 --> 00:23:23,680
Headmaster, I wonder how many disciples of Chan State Academy passed this time?

275
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,779
- Yes!
- Tell us!
- None, right?

276
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:28,880
Although the tower is expensive, but it doesn't seem firm at all.

277
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,340
Now, Chan State Academy's disciples don't even have a chance to retake the exam.

278
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:35,140
- You...
- He's right.
- None!

279
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,859
What the devil did you do?

280
00:23:36,859 --> 00:23:39,440
I was generous to let you inside the tower, and now...

281
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,879
You deliberately destroyed it, didn't you?

282
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,059
Fine! This is a capital offense.

283
00:23:43,059 --> 00:23:46,379
Wind Takers, stay in Chenqiao Town for the rest of your lives.

284
00:23:46,379 --> 00:23:48,799
You shall never participate in the Pneuma Combat Convention again!

285
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:51,720
He took off!

286
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,519
All right now!

287
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:58,260
Let me introduce to you once again, your senior, God of Bandits.

288
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:01,100
- He's God of Bandits?
- Lu Ping is God of Bandits?

289
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,119
I'm not dreaming, am I?

290
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,619
- Does it hurt?
- Doesn't it hurt?

291
00:24:05,619 --> 00:24:07,798
He even acquired the Tianying Stone.

292
00:24:07,798 --> 00:24:11,059
You don't believe my words, the words of your Eldest Senior, any longer?

293
00:24:11,059 --> 00:24:12,100
It's true then!

294
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,799
So Lu Ping was the one who saved us from Mountain and Sea Gang!

295
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:18,950
- God of Bandits!
- Lu Ping!

296
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:22,850
- God of Bandits!
- Lu Ping!

297
00:24:22,858 --> 00:24:25,279
Miss, why don't we sit down and rest?

298
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:26,659
God of Bandits! Lu Ping!

299
00:24:26,659 --> 00:24:28,219
Let's go!

300
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,680
Thank you for the Tianying Stone.

301
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,379
A delinquent will always be a delinquent.

302
00:24:46,379 --> 00:24:48,420
You just can't control your hands.

303
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,820
Stealing means taking without asking.

304
00:24:51,619 --> 00:24:53,919
I traded it with something of the same value.

305
00:25:02,219 --> 00:25:04,680
This is belong to the Mountain and Sea Gang!

306
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,559
When did you give it to me?

307
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:11,180
That is more useful to you than it is to me.

308
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:15,279
I hope you get what you want one day.

309
00:25:24,139 --> 00:25:26,160
Don't touch my brother!

310
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,499
He needs to heal.

311
00:25:29,499 --> 00:25:33,759
Miss Qin, all the troubles along the way are brought by you chasing my brother.

312
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:36,559
We don't know if the Mountain and Sea Gang is planning an ambush around here.

313
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,739
We should go.

314
00:25:38,739 --> 00:25:42,979
Everyone has their own path, I wish you would stop chasing after my brother.

315
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,459
Brother, let's go!

316
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:56,359
Miss, are you really letting Young Master Lu go?

317
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,500
We still have work to do.

318
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:05,200
Don't you think what happened in the tower is a bit suspicious?

319
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,359
You mean... The Wei Family?

320
00:26:14,659 --> 00:26:16,459
Lu Ping got away?

321
00:26:16,459 --> 00:26:17,840
Who on earth is Lu Ping?

322
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:22,439
How could you fail with so many men and mechanisms in the tower?

323
00:26:22,439 --> 00:26:26,200
He brought the tower to the ground, many of our men died in there.

324
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,119
Fortunately, I already told them to not wear our signature clothes.

325
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:31,480
At the moment, we haven't been exposed.

326
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,240
He broke the tower?

327
00:26:37,899 --> 00:26:40,259
Even damaging the tower is a crime.

328
00:26:40,259 --> 00:26:43,098
Gather all of our men to look for them.

329
00:26:43,098 --> 00:26:46,858
Head to the governmental office if you have to, I don't care how much money we have to spend.

330
00:26:46,858 --> 00:26:49,659
Have them guard the gate.

331
00:26:49,659 --> 00:26:52,839
Lu Ping can never leave Chan State!

332
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,859
Master, one more thing!

333
00:26:56,859 --> 00:27:00,079
There was another person in the tower.

334
00:27:03,899 --> 00:27:07,359
Miss Qin! I thought you set off for Kaifeng?

335
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:14,178
Master Wei, did you know that someone from Mountain and Sea Gang entered the tower and tried to kill me?

336
00:27:14,178 --> 00:27:16,799
Well...

337
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:19,178
Why were you in the tower?

338
00:27:19,178 --> 00:27:20,839
Mountain and Sea Gang?

339
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:24,540
Even if they ought to commit crimes, they wouldn't do it in the tower.

340
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:27,019
They wouldn't dare offend your family.

341
00:27:27,019 --> 00:27:30,239
They are thousands of mechanisms in the tower.

342
00:27:30,239 --> 00:27:33,850
Perhaps someone of Wind Takers accidentally activated it

343
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:35,910
and hurt you unintentionally.

344
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:38,858
The machines in the tower are for the purpose of the exam.

345
00:27:38,858 --> 00:27:41,800
But the ones I bumped into are all fatal and dangerous.

346
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:45,540
My Kuiying Sword couldn't even cut its iron cage.

347
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,839
This is clearly plotted!

348
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,850
Since you're willing to cooperate,

349
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:58,790
then I shall stay and find out the truth with you.

350
00:28:01,379 --> 00:28:03,599
Okay... Okay.

351
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:06,599
I'll give out the orders.

352
00:28:11,959 --> 00:28:15,198
Father! Help me, Father!

353
00:28:15,198 --> 00:28:18,200
Father! Help me!

354
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,680
Do you have any idea who my father is?

355
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,939
Brother, what are you doing here?

356
00:28:36,939 --> 00:28:40,278
Miss, please forgive the Agile Dragon Army for not arriving on time to save you.

357
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:48,738
General Qin, I...

358
00:28:51,059 --> 00:28:52,620
It was impolite of me to receive you like this.

359
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:55,250
Please forgive me, General.

360
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:07,279
Big Brother!

361
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:11,139
After all the days you've been gone, so am I still a brother to you now?

362
00:29:11,139 --> 00:29:14,499
Actually, I would've come home after a few days.

363
00:29:14,499 --> 00:29:17,340
You wouldn't have to bring so many men to get me.

364
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,580
Even the Agile Dragon Army is here.

365
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:22,499
Outsiders would think you're fighting a war again.

366
00:29:22,499 --> 00:29:25,739
If something did happen to you, even if the General was on a battlefield,

367
00:29:25,739 --> 00:29:28,020
he would still come back for you.

368
00:29:29,939 --> 00:29:32,880
Big Brother... I was wrong.

369
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,140
I shouldn't worry you.

370
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,219
I've been out in the world for so many years.

371
00:29:37,219 --> 00:29:39,799
I don't need you to protect me like this.

372
00:29:40,859 --> 00:29:43,280
You don't need protection?

373
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:46,119
Then take good care of yourself!

374
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:52,680
Are those the people who hurt you?

375
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,598
General! I treated Miss Qin like my guest!

376
00:29:56,599 --> 00:29:58,259
I would never dare!

377
00:29:58,259 --> 00:29:59,839
Please clearly investigate, General!

378
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,539
Sangsang, help! Sangsang!

379
00:30:01,539 --> 00:30:05,320
How dare you! You don't get to call Miss Qin by her name!

380
00:30:06,959 --> 00:30:10,140
Big Brother, this is just a misunderstanding.

381
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:12,920
I hurt myself accidentally.

382
00:30:29,659 --> 00:30:31,418
Thank you, General!

383
00:30:31,418 --> 00:30:33,920
I'm scared, Father.

384
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,919
Sang'er,

385
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,859
it's time to go home.

386
00:30:39,859 --> 00:30:42,539
It's almost time for the Pneuma Combat Convention.

387
00:30:42,539 --> 00:30:44,720
You should stay focused.

388
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:49,400
[Wei Residence]

389
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,880
Big Brother, about Mountain and Sea Gang...

390
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,480
The world will take care of the world's business.

391
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,939
But the Wei Family didn't help much with rescuing the Phoenix Ridge Gang

392
00:30:54,939 --> 00:30:58,058
and now with the thing of the tower, they truly are suspicious.

393
00:30:58,058 --> 00:31:00,359
Should you really not look into them?

394
00:31:05,419 --> 00:31:08,779
Think about it! If what you said sounds like such a comprehensive plan,

395
00:31:08,779 --> 00:31:13,720
how could the Mountain and Sea Gang allow someone like Wei Tianqi be a part of it?

396
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,340
Sangsang!

397
00:31:24,659 --> 00:31:26,960
That sort of makes sense!

398
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,998
But how did you know I'm here?

399
00:31:29,998 --> 00:31:31,979
Did Ziyan tell you?

400
00:31:31,979 --> 00:31:35,379
You wrote the letter yourself, saying that they imprisoned you here.

401
00:31:35,379 --> 00:31:36,860
Did you forget?

402
00:31:37,999 --> 00:31:40,000
A letter?

403
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:44,780
Sang'er, is there anything else that's left unsolved?

404
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:48,640
Did anyone else pick on you?

405
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,920
General! Actually, in Chenqiao Town—

406
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,880
Nothing happened.

407
00:31:57,779 --> 00:32:01,318
Big Brother, I promise you I will behave this time.

408
00:32:01,318 --> 00:32:05,180
No more troubles! I just need you to promise me something.

409
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,839
Tell me!

410
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:10,359
I want him to send me off.

411
00:32:10,999 --> 00:32:12,520
Me?

412
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,959
Sangsang thinks so highly of me! I, Wei Tianqi, will do whatever it takes!

413
00:32:14,959 --> 00:32:16,960
- You...
- I—

414
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,578
Sang'er, are you really interested in that loser?

415
00:32:22,179 --> 00:32:24,400
He's not like you, only scolding me all the time.

416
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,600
He, at least, will have a chat with me.

417
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:38,818
Sangsang! Wait for me in Kaifeng! I will go and find you.

418
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,620
Sangsang! Wait for me!

419
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:46,479
Wait for me! Sangsang!

420
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:02,580
Watch your step!

421
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:07,558
Our family conquers the world sitting on horses, what a joke would it be if you fall?

422
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:11,319
Miss, breaking the tower is a capital offense.

423
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:13,378
Are you not worried for Young Master Lu?

424
00:33:13,378 --> 00:33:15,519
After all, he did he save me...

425
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,300
I mean, he saved your life, Miss.

426
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:22,038
If I didn't make the Wei Family escort us,

427
00:33:22,038 --> 00:33:24,880
they would be in the hands of Wei Zhong by now.

428
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,858
Whether to live or die, it is up to him now.

429
00:33:27,858 --> 00:33:29,640
I cannot help him.

430
00:33:30,959 --> 00:33:33,799
If my brother gets word of this, it will be even harder for them.

431
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:37,159
Miss, so you intentionally stop the Wei family,

432
00:33:37,159 --> 00:33:39,900
so that they can escape Chan State.

433
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:43,579
In order to protect Young Master Lu, you even admitted to the letter you didn't write!

434
00:33:43,579 --> 00:33:45,280
Are you done?

435
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:50,759
You think Young Master Lu is a good person as well, don't you?

436
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:58,259
I don't think he's a bad person, since he is up against the Mountain and Sea Gang.

437
00:33:58,259 --> 00:34:02,119
It must have been his idea to send a letter to my brother.

438
00:34:02,119 --> 00:34:06,098
He saved me once and I returned the favor, and that's that!

439
00:34:06,098 --> 00:34:10,059
If we ever meet again, I shall give no mercy.

440
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:22,418
Stop looking at it! I know what I'm doing.

441
00:34:22,418 --> 00:34:24,689
It smells amazing!

442
00:34:24,689 --> 00:34:26,678
I was too indiscreet to not have brought salt with me.

443
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:30,139
A little bit of paprika and cumin would have been better!

444
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,560
Eldest Senior.

445
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,658
I'm back from scouting, no one is chasing us.

446
00:34:45,658 --> 00:34:48,919
Chun and Shitou have gone to let them know we're coming.

447
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,540
Let's rest here for a while.

448
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:55,219
If we travel for the night, we'll make it back in Wind Taker Institute tomorrow morning.

449
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:59,399
I never expected the arrival of Qin Qi; he made the Wei Family too occupied to notice us.

450
00:34:59,399 --> 00:35:01,079
We got lucky!

451
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:04,179
Luck? I traded my life for that luck.

452
00:35:04,179 --> 00:35:06,138
Is Lu Ping awake yet?

453
00:35:06,138 --> 00:35:07,818
Serving him is draining me out.

454
00:35:07,818 --> 00:35:09,840
Are you injured?

455
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:14,298
Your elbows are still attached and so are your limbs. So cut the crap!

456
00:35:14,298 --> 00:35:16,480
Men don't fight with girls.

457
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:22,459
Eldest Senior, was it really not you who called the Agile Dragon Army?

458
00:35:22,459 --> 00:35:25,560
I even thought your brother called them.

459
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:29,838
Su Tang, who exactly are you two? Tell me!

460
00:35:29,838 --> 00:35:31,879
Perhaps, I can help.

461
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:34,358
Maybe I can help you save some trouble.

462
00:35:34,358 --> 00:35:36,199
You can't help us.

463
00:35:37,779 --> 00:35:39,319
Brother!

464
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:42,160
Have some water!

465
00:35:46,228 --> 00:35:49,960
Brother, you were nice in the tower.

466
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,679
Why are you acting up?

467
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:53,369
That was in the tower.

468
00:35:53,369 --> 00:35:55,618
What happens in the tower, stays in the tower.

469
00:35:55,618 --> 00:35:59,059
Besides, the Wei Family and the Mountain and Sea Gang won't let us go so easily.

470
00:35:59,059 --> 00:36:03,840
Are you trying to lose another leg by following us?

471
00:36:06,619 --> 00:36:09,399
Wind Takers never lets anyone stay behind.

472
00:36:09,399 --> 00:36:11,379
This is our rule.

473
00:36:11,379 --> 00:36:14,599
Whether you want it or not, I'll obey it.

474
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:17,119
As you wish!

475
00:36:25,239 --> 00:36:28,018
- Master!
- What did you say?

476
00:36:28,018 --> 00:36:30,819
Lu Ping is the God of Bandits?

477
00:36:30,819 --> 00:36:33,718
- Yes.
- And he even broke their tower?

478
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:35,189
- Yes, Master!
- Yes!

479
00:36:35,189 --> 00:36:37,879
If you ask me, I don't think Lu Ping is a fool.

480
00:36:37,879 --> 00:36:39,719
He's keeping all the skills hidden.

481
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:42,519
Yes! Eldest Senior said he and Lu Ping are both wounded, so they walk slower.

482
00:36:42,519 --> 00:36:45,539
They want us to bring the good news to you first, they'll be here very soon.

483
00:36:45,539 --> 00:36:49,019
Master, should we get ready to welcome them?

484
00:36:49,019 --> 00:36:51,769
Welcome my head!

485
00:36:52,799 --> 00:36:54,479
Come here, all of you!

486
00:36:56,719 --> 00:37:01,339
Do you have any idea how costly that tower is?

487
00:37:25,429 --> 00:37:27,038
Which part went out of our control?

488
00:37:27,038 --> 00:37:28,819
Never mind Qin Sang's causing some troubles.

489
00:37:28,819 --> 00:37:31,400
Now, Qin Qi, too?

490
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,599
Lu Ping sneaked out of Chan State right under our noses.

491
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:39,020
Master, he can't run forever.

492
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:42,600
No matter how far he goes, he still have to go back to Wind Takers.

493
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:46,920
Before His Lord starts blaming us, we have to get him back!

494
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:50,989
In order to keep everyone's mouth shut, wipe out Wind Taker Institute.

495
00:37:50,989 --> 00:37:52,439
Yes.

496
00:37:53,139 --> 00:37:57,529
Senior Wei, do we really have to find Lu Ping? He brings bad luck.

497
00:37:57,529 --> 00:38:01,690
If it weren't for him, why would Sangsang be so far away from me?

498
00:38:02,269 --> 00:38:05,320
And how could Chan State Academy be completely humiliated?

499
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:09,968
If we do not revenge, how can you call yourselves men of the martial arts?

500
00:38:10,779 --> 00:38:12,778
My father is a coward.

501
00:38:12,778 --> 00:38:15,989
But I, Wei Tianqi, will not tolerate this!

502
00:38:15,989 --> 00:38:18,459
But Lu Ping is capable of breaking the tower to ruins.

503
00:38:18,459 --> 00:38:22,598
Our men, including you, might not be his rival.

504
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:25,379
- He has a point.
- Yes.

505
00:38:27,869 --> 00:38:29,529
Don't worry, my friends!

506
00:38:29,529 --> 00:38:32,719
Everything is under my control.

507
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:35,680
Make it tighter.

508
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,020
Tuck it in.

509
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:40,529
Hurry up!

510
00:38:40,529 --> 00:38:43,799
Carry ten kilos with you every day!

511
00:38:43,799 --> 00:38:46,059
I don't want to see anyone lacking one step.

512
00:38:46,059 --> 00:38:48,619
Get moving!

513
00:38:48,619 --> 00:38:51,318
Master! It's daytime already.

514
00:38:51,318 --> 00:38:53,178
Eldest Senior and Lu Ping still haven't come back.

515
00:38:53,178 --> 00:38:54,339
Did anything happen to them?

516
00:38:54,339 --> 00:38:56,038
- Yes, Master!
- Would anything have happened?

517
00:38:56,039 --> 00:38:58,040
Did anything happen?

518
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,419
It's a good thing they haven't come back.

519
00:39:00,419 --> 00:39:03,440
Who knows how much money he is going to cost me?

520
00:39:04,699 --> 00:39:06,840
Sorry!

521
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,379
I let you down again, Master!

522
00:39:08,379 --> 00:39:10,528
Eldest Senior ! Eldest Senior is back.

523
00:39:10,528 --> 00:39:11,960
- Eldest Senior!
- You're back!

524
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:14,078
- Lu Ping! Eldest Brother!
- Are you alright?

525
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:15,479
You're finally home.

526
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,638
- Eldest Senior!
- I got you.

527
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:17,738
Be careful!

528
00:39:17,738 --> 00:39:18,719
What took you so long?

529
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:20,158
Here, I got you.

530
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:21,859
Slower.

531
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:23,518
- Good to have you back.
- All right!
- I was so worried.

532
00:39:23,518 --> 00:39:25,159
Stop!

533
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,920
Master, Chan State's exam...

534
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,960
We won!

535
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,359
- Rong.
- Master.

536
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:39,359
Head to town!

537
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:41,159
See if they have any followers.

538
00:39:41,159 --> 00:39:42,340
Yes, Master.

539
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:44,819
Followers? What followers?

540
00:39:44,819 --> 00:39:46,668
How could there be followers? What does he mean?

541
00:39:46,668 --> 00:39:49,100
- How can this be?
- Didn't we win?

542
00:39:50,139 --> 00:39:54,239
Surround Wind Taker Institute immediately! Don't let anyone out!

543
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:00,109
Master! Master!

544
00:40:01,139 --> 00:40:03,739
The Wei family is here, in Chenqiao Town! They're coming for us!

545
00:40:03,739 --> 00:40:04,778
- See?
- Coming for us?

546
00:40:04,778 --> 00:40:06,159
I told you so!

547
00:40:06,159 --> 00:40:08,598
They're coming for us, what should we do?

548
00:40:08,598 --> 00:40:11,099
The Wei Family got to us before the Mountain and Sea Gang could.

549
00:40:11,099 --> 00:40:13,398
With us here, we'll never allow them to touch Lu Ping!

550
00:40:13,398 --> 00:40:16,559
- That's right.
- That's what I'm talking about! We won't allow it!

551
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:19,519
Although I don't like this Wind Taker Institute,

552
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:21,328
I hate Wei Tianqi even more.

553
00:40:21,328 --> 00:40:23,999
So, I've decided to help you once more for free.

554
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,298
- Yes!
- Thank you, Young Lord Mo! Thank you, Young Lord.

555
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:28,580
Shut up!

556
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,919
You brat...

557
00:40:35,919 --> 00:40:38,699
Ever since the day I took you in,

558
00:40:38,699 --> 00:40:40,778
I knew you'd be a big trouble to me.

559
00:40:40,778 --> 00:40:42,620
Get out now!

560
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:44,219
I said get out!

561
00:40:44,219 --> 00:40:45,340
Master...

562
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:48,220
- Master...
- Why is this happening?

563
00:40:48,229 --> 00:40:50,179
Now is not the time to scold him.

564
00:40:50,179 --> 00:40:52,919
We can't let the Wei Family take Lu Ping away.

565
00:40:52,919 --> 00:40:54,679
What's the matter?

566
00:40:54,679 --> 00:40:57,140
That family has power and money.

567
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:59,120
Do you know that?

568
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,839
This guy?

569
00:41:00,839 --> 00:41:05,160
He's a rat's poop, destroying the entire porridge.

570
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,410
There's no place for him here.

571
00:41:08,229 --> 00:41:09,638
You clearly don't want to offend the Wei Family.

572
00:41:09,638 --> 00:41:11,720
- Yes!
- Exactly!

573
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,568
- What a coward!
- What's up?

574
00:41:13,568 --> 00:41:15,059
How embarrassing?

575
00:41:15,059 --> 00:41:18,480
Today, I will not change my decision.

576
00:41:19,139 --> 00:41:21,580
Who disagrees? Go with him!

577
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,119
Master.

578
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:28,878
Stay away from me! Don't call me master.

579
00:41:28,878 --> 00:41:33,159
With everything that's happening, it's either his departure,

580
00:41:33,159 --> 00:41:35,920
or the end of Wind Takers.

581
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:40,199
From now on,

582
00:41:40,769 --> 00:41:46,329
you have nothing to do with Wind Taker Institute.

583
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:54,908
I'm sick and tired of that shabby little cabin.

584
00:41:54,908 --> 00:41:57,678
Leaving is just a matter of time! The earlier, the better.

585
00:41:57,678 --> 00:41:59,339
Su Tang?

586
00:41:59,339 --> 00:42:02,170
I'll go where my brother goes.

587
00:42:02,899 --> 00:42:04,580
Lu Ping!

588
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,259
Don't let your temper get in the way.

589
00:42:07,259 --> 00:42:09,828
Rest, cripple! Don't break both of your legs.

590
00:42:09,828 --> 00:42:13,239
Otherwise, you'll be taking your loser master's place.

591
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,340
Master.

592
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:21,158
- Don't push Lu Ping away!
- Don't let him go!

593
00:42:21,159 --> 00:42:23,100
Master, don't do this!

594
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:26,138
Please! Please don't do it, Master!

595
00:42:31,489 --> 00:42:33,518
Lu Ping... You acted like you were so sure.

596
00:42:33,518 --> 00:42:37,779
So now where are you going? The Wei Family are almost here.

597
00:42:37,779 --> 00:42:40,159
Come with me...

598
00:42:44,789 --> 00:42:47,218
Master, we've searched the entire Wind Taker Institute.

599
00:42:47,218 --> 00:42:49,060
Lu Ping is nowhere to be found.

600
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:51,000
You're a bunch of losers!

601
00:42:52,839 --> 00:42:55,719
Spit it out! Where's Lu Ping?

602
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,718
Don't abuse your status!

603
00:43:00,718 --> 00:43:02,639
Wind Taker Institute is small

604
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:06,159
but it's not just any place where you can trample over!

605
00:43:07,379 --> 00:43:09,899
Don't, don't, don't! Calm down, calm down!

606
00:43:09,899 --> 00:43:12,780
Don't, don't, don't! Don't fight.

607
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:14,960
Who said you get to do that?

608
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,709
Master Wei, sorry about that.

609
00:43:17,709 --> 00:43:21,268
It's true that Lu Ping is not here any more, I fired him already.

610
00:43:21,268 --> 00:43:25,418
Besides, once he heard your name, he fled with a tail between his legs.

611
00:43:25,418 --> 00:43:28,658
Master, we can't talk to this stubborn, old man.

612
00:43:28,658 --> 00:43:31,300
- Why don't we set this place on fire?
- Do it!

613
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:34,728
Don't! Sir! Please don't! Don't!

614
00:43:34,728 --> 00:43:36,740
Master Wei.

615
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:42,280
I got it! That brat must have fled to the back of the hillside.

616
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:43,479
I'll take you there.

617
00:43:43,479 --> 00:43:44,618
- Hurry up.
- After you.

618
00:43:44,618 --> 00:43:45,818
- Let's go!
- Over here.

619
00:43:45,818 --> 00:43:47,879
This way, please!

620
00:43:47,879 --> 00:43:49,959
- Eldest Senior.
- What should we do?

621
00:43:49,959 --> 00:43:52,139
Follow them! Make sure Master doesn't do anything stupid.

622
00:43:52,139 --> 00:43:54,079
- Okay.
- Let's move.

623

00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:10,720
♫ regretting the lighthouse broke in the waves, ♫

634
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:17,980
♫ I call the Milky Way that isolates us all, blue. ♫

635
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:25,410
♫ Like a moat built under the sea, ♫

636
00:45:25,410 --> 00:45:30,190
♫ waiting for the words on the paper boat to disappear, ♫

637
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:37,400
♫ there must always be someone who doesn’t remember listening to the other. ♫

638
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:44,890
♫ Anyone who is correctly guessed will end in disfavor. ♫

639
00:45:44,890 --> 00:45:49,030
♫ You are particularly touched but others consider it ordinary. ♫

640
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:54,340
♫ Like the author, roughly put down with a weak stroke, ♫

641
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:58,770
♫ the writing boat on the lake was just like a paper crane in the air. ♫

642
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:03,700
♫ Laughing like the moon, ♫

643
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:08,330
♫ regretting the lighthouse broke in the waves, ♫

644
00:46:08,330 --> 00:46:16,280
♫ I call the Milky Way that isolates us all, blue ♫

645
00:46:18,170 --> 00:46:23,290
♫ Can a moat be built on the seabed?  ♫

646
00:46:23,290 --> 00:46:27,680
♫ Wipe all the words on the paper boat! ♫

647
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:34,850
♫ Please let someone not remember and don't tell another! ♫

648
00:46:37,330 --> 00:46:42,140
♫ Hide the reluctance between words ♫

649
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:46,690
♫ Unfortunately, I (you) are an average author ♫

650
00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:54,810
♫ No matter how you (I) describe the rest, it's unnecessary! ♫

651
00:46:56,380 --> 00:47:05,260
♫ Don't describe my unfulfilled promise! ♫

652
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:14,060
♫ Don't interpret my hidden fire-smoke! ♫

653
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:23,020
♫ Don't let the paper boat in the rough wave chasing me! ♫

654
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:30,800
♫ Don't wait until it over to know there are you and me! ♫
