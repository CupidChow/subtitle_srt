00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,840
♫ The dark green sea is hazy ♫

3
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,750
♫ dissipating in a flash. ♫

4
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:36,590
♫ Rivers and lakes divide the world. ♫

5
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:40,010
♫ Ten thousands arrows are firing at once. ♫

6
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:43,940
♫ Who has time to worry? Who loves the color of blood? ♫

7
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:47,770
♫ At that time, spirits are high. ♫

8
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:51,590
♫ Everywhere is home, who can dare let his horse freely run? ♫

9
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:54,440
♫ Silently, tears form in the death of night. ♫

10
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:58,210
♫ Heroes are cutting all ties, ♫

11
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:02,030
♫ giving up whether it's life or death, ♫

12
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:04,190
♫ never asking what the cost is. ♫

13
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:09,810
♫ Good and evil must be distinguished. ♫

14
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,670
♫ The wind blows off the snow. ♫

15
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:17,580
♫ On the body, etch multiple scars, ♫

16
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,650
♫ wandering all over the world, ♫

17
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:25,320
♫ only wish to ask for answers from this world. ♫

18
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,220
♫ A teenager doesn't have to be a hero. ♫

19
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,060
♫ There is no need for flowers in the dream. ♫

20
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,290
♫ Destiny need not be afraid. ♫

21
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:40,780
♫ Because you have him all the way, ♫

22
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:44,710
♫ experienced a handful of conquests, ♫

23
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:48,530
♫ overcame a number of challenges. ♫

24

[Episode 10]

29
00:02:27,589 --> 00:02:29,489
Stay alert!

30
00:02:31,689 --> 00:02:33,169
Minmin.

31
00:02:33,169 --> 00:02:36,409
What do you think about these adorable disciples?

32
00:02:36,409 --> 00:02:38,710
Do you like them?

33
00:02:43,909 --> 00:02:45,688
Don't gloat too soon!

34
00:02:45,688 --> 00:02:48,669
I have many more ways to torture you.

35
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:54,150
Be sure to wake up early to come here tomorrow!

36
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:15,468
Greetings, Master! Please allow us to kowtow to you.

37
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,169
Save your energy!

38
00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:54,149
Leave it for the convention!

39
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:57,909
Brother, Luo Ting made you break one of the Pneuma Confinement's chains.

40
00:03:57,909 --> 00:04:01,629
You can use two kinds of pneumatic powers now, you're way stronger than him.

41
00:04:01,629 --> 00:04:04,668
Master Chu Min, why did my pneumatic power split as well,

42
00:04:04,668 --> 00:04:06,789
but I couldn't learn the Pneuma of Strength like them?

43
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:09,089
Are you hiding something from me?

44
00:04:09,089 --> 00:04:14,348
Your Mo family's imperfect bloodline are destined to have incomplete meridians.

45
00:04:14,348 --> 00:04:17,108
You won't be able to learn the Pneuma of Strength.

46
00:04:17,109 --> 00:04:21,168
That's why during Soul Splitting, you're the only one who lost all five senses.

47
00:04:21,168 --> 00:04:23,689
You'd better give up earlier.

48
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:30,050
What's with the long face?

49
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:38,920
Sometimes, the level of martial arts isn't determined by the amount of pneumatic power

50
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,120
but the usage of it.

51
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,749
Certain techniques need the usage of multiple pneumatic powers simultaneously.

52
00:04:45,749 --> 00:04:48,290
The arrangement and grouping of the six pneumas are endless.

53
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:51,049
The derived techniques will also be endless.

54
00:04:51,049 --> 00:04:56,089
This is the essence of pneumatic power.

55
00:04:56,089 --> 00:04:57,808
Assassin Boy still doesn't understand.

56
00:04:57,808 --> 00:05:01,968
If they are properly combined, having five pneumatic powers won't be a loss.

57
00:05:03,429 --> 00:05:06,289
Having one less pneumatic power to train on,

58
00:05:06,289 --> 00:05:10,389
the other five pneumatic powers will be more refined.

59
00:05:13,109 --> 00:05:15,928
I got it! So this is good news.

60
00:05:15,928 --> 00:05:19,368
Just like I used the Pneuma of Energy to dodge Eldest Senior's Pneuma of Sound.

61
00:05:19,368 --> 00:05:22,629
After that, I used the Pneuma of Pivot to sprinkle the knockout drops.

62
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:25,900
I could assassinate while staying invisible at the end.

63
00:05:32,429 --> 00:05:34,348
Su Tang, how about it?

64
00:05:34,348 --> 00:05:36,829
With my martial arts, I can surpass Eldest Senior now.

65
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:39,009
I want to train alone.

66
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:53,440
- After Xifan's Soul Splitting, it seems he totally changed, did his brain get smashed that day?
- Master!

67
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,149
I won't be wrong in my judgment.

68
00:05:56,149 --> 00:05:59,469
Maybe something went wrong during the Soul Splitting.

69
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:33,909
Eldest Senior! Are you all right?

70
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:35,709
I'm fine.

71
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:52,630
When my brother wants to hide his injury from me,

72
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:55,670
he has the same expression as you have right now.

73
00:07:01,429 --> 00:07:04,409
Tell me first! What happened to you?

74
00:07:04,409 --> 00:07:09,328
Didn't you restore your hearing because you had broken through the Soul Splitting in the Tripitaka Sutra Pavilion?

75
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:11,588
How could you lose the Pneuma of Sound now?

76
00:07:11,588 --> 00:07:14,629
I used excessive force that my meridians are blocked.

77
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,189
It's nothing serious.

78
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:18,769
Blocked meridians?

79
00:07:18,769 --> 00:07:21,509
Was it because when you saved my brother in the Tripitaka Sutra Pavilion,

80
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:26,328
your Soul Splitting wasn't complete and yet, you still helped him, that's why your meridians are blocked?

81
00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:30,808
- I'm going to find my brother.
- Su Tang!

82
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,110
Be careful!

83
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:43,950
I checked the ancient records.

84
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:48,150
Halting the Soul Splitting is unsolvable.

85
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:50,849
What will be, will be.

86
00:07:50,849 --> 00:07:54,069
I'll let nature takes its course.

87
00:07:54,069 --> 00:07:56,180
The time will come.

88
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:59,650
It was my own choice.

89
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:02,549
Lu Ping doesn't owe me anything.

90
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:05,430
You shouldn't tell him about this.

91
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:08,050
You should at least rest for two days.

92
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,369
The convention is just around the corner.

93
00:08:12,369 --> 00:08:16,610
Su Tang, I'm still Wind Takers' most senior brother.

94
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:20,349
I don't want to be a burden or useless to anyone.

95
00:08:20,349 --> 00:08:22,170
Do you understand?

96
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,850
Eldest Senior, your candy.

97
00:08:51,429 --> 00:08:55,249
I'm worried about Eldest Senior, too, so I came to take a look.

98
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,029
Brother, how can you sleep at a time like this?

99
00:09:08,029 --> 00:09:11,429
Brother! Do you hear me?

100
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,408
You shouted so loud, even the deaf can hear you.

101
00:09:17,408 --> 00:09:19,630
Then, you should quickly think of a solution.

102
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:23,129
Eldest Senior already said, "What will be, will be."

103
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:25,680
What can I do?

104
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,149
He's the eldest disciple.

105
00:09:28,149 --> 00:09:31,109
He can still fight with broken legs.

106
00:09:31,109 --> 00:09:34,150
Can he not handle a small problem like this?

107
00:09:36,189 --> 00:09:38,748
I still have something to do, I can't chat.

108
00:09:38,748 --> 00:09:41,149
Do you still have that Osmanthus candy?

109
00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:42,869
Mo Lin!

110
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:46,788
Su Tang is being filial towards me.

111
00:09:46,789 --> 00:09:50,650
Giving it to this guy is better than letting you have it.

112
00:09:52,429 --> 00:09:54,329
Enjoy it!

113
00:10:14,069 --> 00:10:15,610
Why are you following me?

114
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:17,320
We're guys! Don't you understand?

115
00:10:17,329 --> 00:10:19,428
You're actually cold on the outside but warm inside.

116
00:10:19,429 --> 00:10:23,389
The meaner you are towards someone, the more you actually care about them.

117
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:26,189
I guess you're definitely thinking about the way to help Eldest Senior.

118
00:10:26,189 --> 00:10:28,590
Right, Disciple Brother?

119
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:31,509
What did you call me? Disciple Brother?

120
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:34,528
Yes, you're my disciple's God-brother, so you're Disciple Brother.

121
00:10:34,528 --> 00:10:38,400
Otherwise, why would I run all the way to appease you?

122
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,909
Assassin Boy.

123
00:10:39,909 --> 00:10:43,210
I told you before, I'm not a boy.

124
00:10:44,048 --> 00:10:46,109
You accepted the mission to kill me back then.

125
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:49,130
Wasn't it to earn money and venture the pugilist world?

126
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:53,000
Why are you clinging to my sister and not leaving?

127
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,850
You tried for so long, why didn't you give up?

128
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:02,389
Although that brat, Su Tang, has great strength and is fierce towards me,

129
00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:05,409
she's actually quite kind.

130
00:11:05,409 --> 00:11:07,448
I'm used to living alone.

131
00:11:07,448 --> 00:11:09,929
If I were to leave now,

132
00:11:09,929 --> 00:11:12,389
without Su Tang's fierceness, your loathsomeness,

133
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:15,169
Guo Youdao's shamelessness, and Xifan's coldness,

134
00:11:15,169 --> 00:11:17,250
I'd feel like something is missing.

135
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,010
What's missing?

136
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:23,609
During the Soul Splitting, I was thinking,

137
00:11:23,609 --> 00:11:26,729
if I couldn't survive it,

138
00:11:26,729 --> 00:11:28,669
everyone would get bad luck.

Instantly and inexplicably, I could move.

Honestly,

142
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:41,469
getting a disciple isn't that important,

143
00:11:41,469 --> 00:11:45,390
having an excuse to stay is good enough.

144

Oh right! When I broke through the Soul Splitting, I was thinking about you guys.

Listen carefully! You can do whatever to Luo Ting.

161
00:13:12,468 --> 00:13:16,488
However, Lu Ping is under my command! Without my command, nobody can touch him.

162
00:13:16,488 --> 00:13:17,850
But...

163
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:25,850
Lu Ping is under your command?

164
00:13:31,029 --> 00:13:33,870
Miss, you're still protecting Young Master Lu.

165
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:40,789
Wen Rui is right! He's just a second-rate person.

166
00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:47,930
But when he's serious, it's reassuring to let him watch my back.

167
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:57,130
It's me!

168
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:05,949
Young Master Lu, you're too rash! How dare you trespass a general's residence?

169
00:14:05,949 --> 00:14:08,729
If they discover you, you'll be shot to death.

170
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:11,869
Did you hear her?

171
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:16,468
The Agile Dragon Army is just outside, waiting to peel your skin off.

172
00:14:16,468 --> 00:14:20,288
My skin is rough and tough, the army wouldn't be bothered.

173
00:14:20,288 --> 00:14:24,489
But regarding the Soul Splitting, Qin Qi didn't give you a hard time, right?

174
00:14:25,429 --> 00:14:27,870
Did you come here because you're worried?

175
00:14:31,449 --> 00:14:33,130
What's this?

176
00:14:34,069 --> 00:14:35,490
It's for you.

177
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:39,529
Take a look!

178
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:19,050
Did you bring this as an apology or is it part of your scheme again?

179
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:22,329
This... Didn't I tear your clothes last time?

180
00:15:22,329 --> 00:15:28,370
When I look at it, if you were to wear it, it should look quite nice on you.

181
00:15:32,549 --> 00:15:36,328
Right, the Soul Combat Convention will happen soon, so there are many candidates.

182
00:15:36,328 --> 00:15:39,028
Not every candidate can meet Wen Gecheng.

183
00:15:39,029 --> 00:15:43,130
So I came here specifically to inquire about Wen Gecheng.

184
00:15:48,909 --> 00:15:50,889
Inquire?

185
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:57,689
Do you know under Shuo's laws, what's the punishment for bribery is?

186
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:00,790
Bribery?

187
00:16:01,809 --> 00:16:06,368
Ziyan, call Wen Rui! Tell him someone trespassed our residence.

188
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:20,550
Ziyan, bring my brush here!

189
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:24,010
I can't accept this bribe for naught.

190
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:32,568
She's from a government official family indeed, how did it become bribery?

191
00:16:32,568 --> 00:16:35,869
- She mistook my kindness for malice.
- Young Master Lu!

192
00:16:37,709 --> 00:16:39,650
Miss Ling.

193
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:41,850
This is from Miss Qin.

194
00:16:48,709 --> 00:16:52,328
When the Mountain and Sea Gang was hunting down Mr. Wen back then, my brother saved him.

195
00:16:52,328 --> 00:16:54,829
My brother takes him as his confidant.

196
00:16:54,829 --> 00:16:57,149
In addition, he's the chief examiner of the convention.

197
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:59,709
To prevent fraud, no one can get near him.

198
00:16:59,709 --> 00:17:04,189
But this Pneuma Combat Convention is really meaningful to my brother, he'll definitely be there.

199
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:07,708
Provided that you pass the preliminary exam, you'll definitely meet him.

200
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,988
Miss Qin said, the answers to your questions are in the letter.

201
00:17:13,989 --> 00:17:17,568
If you don't want to be skinned, don't bring trouble to the Qin family.

202
00:17:17,568 --> 00:17:21,460
I thought she was dumb, I can't believe she always surprises me.

203
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:26,629
I also thought your mistress hates me the most for she thinks I'm a heartless person.

204
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:28,729
No, that's not true.

205
00:17:28,729 --> 00:17:30,209
What's not true?

206
00:17:30,209 --> 00:17:33,749
The person who may seem heartless is, actually, the sincerest one.

207
00:17:33,749 --> 00:17:37,640
Young Master Lu, you are actually the sincerest person.

208
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,160
Did your mistress say that?

209
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,500
Yes.

210
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:54,229
Miss Ling, it's getting late, you should go back.

211
00:17:54,229 --> 00:17:59,029
Young Master Lu, actually, I can go home later.

212
00:17:59,029 --> 00:18:02,428
The convention is near, do you have anything I can help with?

213
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:09,240
Now that you mention it, I almost forgot but I'm not sure if you're willing to help me or not.

214
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,790
Tell me!

215
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:14,509
My Eldest Senior is stubborn.

216
00:18:14,509 --> 00:18:17,069
He doesn't listen to me.

217
00:18:17,069 --> 00:18:21,500
If Miss Ling can help me unravel his trouble...

218
00:18:28,429 --> 00:18:32,830
Halting the Soul Splitting is unsolvable.

219
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:36,770
What will be, will be! I'll let nature takes its course.

220
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:38,670
The time will come.

221
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:47,160
If I can never use the pneumatic power again, I should at least relearn my blade techniques.

222
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,449
I can't be everyone's burden.

223
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,809
Xifan!

224
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:31,169
- Miss Ling.
- I'm sorry!

225
00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:34,628
Hero Xifan, I brought this for you.

226
00:19:37,369 --> 00:19:40,289
It's fine, it's fine!

227
00:19:41,369 --> 00:19:44,430
Is something troubling you, Hero Xifan?

228
00:19:52,089 --> 00:19:57,428
I was sold to the Qin family since young, so I'm quite perceptive towards other people's emotions.

229
00:19:57,428 --> 00:20:01,528
If anything is troubling you, you'll feel better if you say it out loud.

230
00:20:01,528 --> 00:20:03,589
I'm a useless piece of junk.

231
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:05,559
You're not useless.

232
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:09,369
If it wasn't for you, I'd have already lost my life in the Tripitaka Sutra Pavilion.

233
00:20:09,369 --> 00:20:12,188
Miss Qin and Young Master Lu wouldn't have escape unscathed, either.

234
00:20:12,189 --> 00:20:16,028
You put your life at risk to save others, you're a hero.

235
00:20:16,909 --> 00:20:21,368
Wind Taker Institute has a united front, you'll definitely succeed in the Pneuma Combat Convention.

236
00:20:21,368 --> 00:20:23,929
Young Master Lu definitely won't complain that you're a hindrance.

237
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,668
It's getting late, I'll take my leave then.

238
00:20:41,509 --> 00:20:42,929
Miss Ling.

239
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:49,750
Did Lu Ping send you?

240
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:10,229
Some sickness can only be cured by ladies.

241
00:21:10,229 --> 00:21:15,190
Which girl did you cheat to get this Miss Ling?

242
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,650
A silly girl who looks stern.

243
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:31,729
Brother, is this real?

244
00:21:31,729 --> 00:21:34,370
Pneuma Combat Convention's preliminary exam is in ten days.

245
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:37,450
We can finally meet Wen Gecheng.

[Kaifeng City]

247

[Qin Residence]

248
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:59,909
The convention will start soon, why are you still here?

249
00:21:59,909 --> 00:22:04,710
Today's Pneuma Combat Convention, Uncle Wen will be there, right?

250
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:10,510
Sir Wen is the convention's chief examiner, I already sent someone to pick him up.

251
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:13,729
What? Why are you still standing here?

252
00:22:13,729 --> 00:22:18,689
If you come late, even if you're my sister, I won't tolerate it.

253
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:30,449
The convention is starting, why are you smiling instead of getting nervous?

254
00:22:31,189 --> 00:22:35,328
Brother, as your sister, I'm a woman of her words.

255
00:22:35,328 --> 00:22:37,349
I feel at ease then.

256
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:54,688
Eldest Senior, look at the fluttering flags of the other martial arts academies!

257
00:22:54,688 --> 00:22:59,229
Ours is the only shabby-looking ones, like a miscellaneous army; we look poor, don't we?

258
00:22:59,229 --> 00:23:02,469
Tell me! Why didn't Master prepare for us?

259
00:23:02,469 --> 00:23:05,968
Pneuma Combat Convention is about martial arts, not about putting on a show.

260
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:08,470
These symbolic items aren't important.

261
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:16,590
Brother, can we really meet Wen Gecheng this time?

262
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:18,270
This time,

263
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:21,560
we definitely can.

264
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:27,700
[Mount Wansui]

265
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:05,369
Even at the Pneuma Combat Convention, you're still wearing your shabby clothes.

266
00:24:05,369 --> 00:24:10,089
Listen to me, just go home! You're embarrassing yourself by staying here.

267
00:24:11,529 --> 00:24:13,149
Qin Qi is here.

268
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:27,789
Disciple, don't let him frighten you, I have seen much of the world.

269
00:24:27,789 --> 00:24:29,689
I'm very clear about how this will go.

270
00:24:29,689 --> 00:24:34,148
After this, it's most likely that he'll talk about saving the state and upholding justice.

271
00:24:38,289 --> 00:24:42,528
When you all come to this convention, you have already been aware of the enlistment.

272
00:24:42,528 --> 00:24:46,569
Death is common in the cruel battlefield, it's the same for today.

273
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:48,090
Pneuma Combat Convention will begin.

274
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:52,749
Those who fear death, please leave now; stay if you're willing.

275
00:24:52,749 --> 00:24:56,708
After wearing this waist tag, you've signed the oath of enlistment.

276
00:24:56,708 --> 00:25:00,170
There's only superiority, your life matters not.

277
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:16,569
Pneuma Combat Convention's first round is to test everyone's pneumatic power.

278
00:25:16,569 --> 00:25:20,649
As long as the entire team passes a total of four stages,

279
00:25:20,649 --> 00:25:22,949
they will advance.

280
00:25:22,949 --> 00:25:27,129
As for the rest, let your strength speaks for itself.

281
00:25:34,989 --> 00:25:36,888
There are many people here.

282
00:25:36,888 --> 00:25:41,749
Let's get to the second round first and wait until there are fewer people.

283
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:00,789
You may start.

284
00:26:04,609 --> 00:26:07,629
Command tokens are hanging on the top of the tree.

285
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:10,109
Rely on the Pneuma of Energy's lightness skill to rise to the top.

286
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:13,509
Whoever can retrieve the command token may pass.
 [Energy]

-There's one more guy.

288
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:28,030
- Watch out!
- He's laying still.

289
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:31,048
- Come down!
- What's wrong?

290
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:33,729
- How can he be this bad?
- So silly!

291
00:26:33,729 --> 00:26:35,370
- Just come down!
- Are you all right?

292
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:38,460
Try harder! Can you train for two more years?

293
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,469
Let it go! Come down quickly.

294
00:26:40,469 --> 00:26:43,549
- Come down if you can't! Let it go.
- That's right!

295
00:26:43,549 --> 00:26:45,069
Stop it! You can't reach it.

296
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,789
- You can't reach it.
- Come down.

297
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:48,509
Watch out!

298

- Are you all right?
- Are you okay?

299
00:26:56,469 --> 00:27:00,409
The pose isn't important, the most important is the result.

300
00:27:02,469 --> 00:27:07,029
Shining Sky Academy and Wind Taker Institute have passed the stage for the Pneuma of Energy.

301
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,929
In every corner of the forest,

302
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:23,409
six musicians are playing the same song.

303
00:27:23,409 --> 00:27:26,489
Everyone needs to use the Pneuma of Sound

304
00:27:26,489 --> 00:27:30,948
to identify their current location and mark them on the map.

305
00:27:30,948 --> 00:27:33,189
Whoever can identify more than three musicians

306
00:27:33,189 --> 00:27:36,989
may pass the stage for the Pneuma of Sound.

307
00:27:57,110 --> 00:28:01,868
I'm done! I've marked all six musicians. Check them!

308
00:28:07,329 --> 00:28:09,549
Not bad! All your answers are correct.

309
00:28:09,549 --> 00:28:12,989
But the exam hasn't ended.

310
00:28:12,989 --> 00:28:15,680
As per the convention regulations,

311
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:20,450
you must play the song you heard

312
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:25,268
to prove that it's the song you heard and you didn't cheat.

313
00:28:25,269 --> 00:28:28,209
Only then will you pass this stage.

314
00:28:28,209 --> 00:28:32,330
The exam on the Pneuma of Sound requires me to play music and know musical notes.

315
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:35,789
It's a rule established by Sir Xia personally.

316
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:40,270
I believe all of you are from prestigious academies.

317
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:41,790
It's not difficult, right?

318
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:46,830
Lu Ping, Kaifeng belongs to the prominent families after all.

319
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:50,389
All of you are a bunch of wild kids, you're nothing.

320
00:28:54,669 --> 00:28:59,289
Lu Ping, I tried my best and finally passed two stages.

321
00:28:59,289 --> 00:29:04,148
I thought you nailed the stage for the Pneuma of Sound, did you get a stomachache?

322
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:08,789
Whatever! It's supposed to be an exam for officials initially.

323
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:11,970
Those from prominent families will have the upper hand inevitably.

324
00:29:12,749 --> 00:29:15,389
But we must pass four stages out of the six stages.

325
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:20,950
Unfortunately, I just unlocked the Pneuma of Essence and it's poorly used because of the disruption of Soul Splitting

326
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:23,169
We can only count on Su Tang now.

327
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,990
[Strength]

328
00:29:39,749 --> 00:29:42,548
Miss, for the test on the Pneuma of Strength,

329
00:29:42,548 --> 00:29:46,228
everyone must lift more than five stone dumbbells to pass.

330
00:29:46,229 --> 00:29:49,789
You look weak and thin, it's better if you give up.

331
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:53,449
Now, I only passed the test for the Pneuma of Vision.

332
00:29:53,449 --> 00:29:56,909
For this round, I have to win.

333
00:29:56,909 --> 00:30:00,168
All right, I understand the rule. Let's begin!

334
00:30:01,529 --> 00:30:06,329
All right! The test on the Pneuma of Strength begins now.

335
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:50,108
What are you doing? What are you doing?

336
00:30:56,029 --> 00:30:59,770
Put me down!

337
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:03,409
I'm afraid of heights.

338
00:31:10,529 --> 00:31:14,909
Three adult men are putting all their hopes on a young lady.

339
00:31:14,909 --> 00:31:20,688
Let me tell you! I just passed five of the tests with flying colors.

340
00:31:20,688 --> 00:31:27,088
I heard that someone was completely humiliated in the test for the Pneuma of Sound.

341
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:33,590
Young Master Wei, you talk so much nonsense,

342
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:37,009
why don't you taste the good stuff I have?

343
00:31:40,749 --> 00:31:44,908
I really want to see how long you guys can stay here. Let's go!

344
00:31:46,229 --> 00:31:48,228
- Brother.
- Su Tang.

345
00:31:48,228 --> 00:31:51,529
- I passed.
- Disciple, are you okay?

346
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:55,168
I did tell both of you about those elites who gather at this Pneuma Combat Convention.

347
00:31:55,168 --> 00:31:58,349
Can't you figure a way out? You can't just depend on my luck.

348
00:31:58,349 --> 00:32:01,268
Su Tang, you did great!

349
00:32:01,268 --> 00:32:03,290
I was the one holding you guys back.

350
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:06,649
Eldest Senior, don't listen to Mo Lin.

351
00:32:06,649 --> 00:32:09,530
The goal of Pneuma Combat Convention is to gather elites from various regions.

352
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:11,508
It's not odd that the standard are higher.

353
00:32:11,508 --> 00:32:16,448
Let's go home earlier and rest well, maybe you'll recover tomorrow.

354
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:30,730
General, this is the list of those who passed the preliminary exam.

355
00:32:34,949 --> 00:32:37,549
Reassign some camps of the Agile Dragon Army.

356
00:32:37,549 --> 00:32:42,708
Let them stay in the camp area during the convention to prevent cheating.

357
00:32:42,708 --> 00:32:47,609
Drawing lots is coming next, we need to prepare for tomorrow's second round of tests.

358
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:49,988
That's right, General.

359
00:32:49,989 --> 00:32:54,769
Do you know which martial arts academy the simplest team belong to?

360
00:32:54,769 --> 00:32:57,770
I think I saw an old acquaintance among them.

361
00:32:57,770 --> 00:33:02,270
It's Wind Taker Institute! It's the institute where that kid, Lu Ping, is from.

362
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:06,968
Sir, he harbors evil intentions, not worth mentioning.

363
00:33:08,289 --> 00:33:10,409
The snowfield was freezing cold.

364
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:13,409
He would've been long gone.

365
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:18,009
Sir.

366
00:33:21,809 --> 00:33:23,209
Sir Wen.

367
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:27,708
I'm fine! I just recalled some past memories.

368
00:33:27,708 --> 00:33:31,548
Brother, Uncle Wen, I passed the exam.

369
00:33:31,548 --> 00:33:34,789
Wen Rui, send Sir Wen to his room.

370
00:33:34,789 --> 00:33:36,369
Yes.

371
00:33:36,369 --> 00:33:38,910
Is Uncle Wen leaving?

372
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:41,540
Can't you stay for a while?

373
00:33:41,549 --> 00:33:45,970
Maybe... Maybe someone wants to find you.

374
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:47,870
Sir Wen has an old illness.

375
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:51,000
Could any matter be more important than his own health?

376
00:33:51,008 --> 00:33:52,530
Sir Wen.

377
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:05,670
Bad timing! I need to find Lu Ping.

378
00:34:09,789 --> 00:34:11,850
Brother, what's wrong?

379
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:20,450
Take a seat first! This convention isn't as simple as we thought.

380
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:24,368
This round tests us on the four pneumatic powers and the next round can be problematic, too.

381
00:34:24,368 --> 00:34:28,488
We must figure out a way to meet Wen Gecheng, we can't just be idle to take the exam.

382
00:34:28,488 --> 00:34:31,688
Then, what about Eldest Senior? Also, what about Master and Mo Lin?

383
00:34:31,688 --> 00:34:33,269
Lu Ping!

384
00:34:34,369 --> 00:34:36,420
I've been looking for you guys. Follow me now!

385
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:38,440
My uncle Wen has already left.

386
00:34:39,189 --> 00:34:40,770
All right!

387
00:34:50,829 --> 00:34:53,389
Wen Rui should've sent him back to his residence.

388
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:56,749
My brother is handling matters, so he won't be back for a while.

389
00:34:56,749 --> 00:34:58,308
Take my horse!

390
00:34:58,309 --> 00:35:01,469
For the drawing lots, I'll ask Xifan to do it for you.

00:35:46,379 --> 00:35:47,809
General gave his orders.

393
00:35:47,809 --> 00:35:52,050
Three years ago, your cardinal was damaged in the snowfield and you need to recuperate.

394
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:55,210
General will handle the matters of the convention.

General Wen, it's fine.

I think it's a wild cat playing in the garden.

Then, rest well, Sir! I won't disturb you anymore.

- General Wen, please!

00:36:32,849 --> 00:36:35,110
You've been hiding for a long time.

402
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:38,189
Why don't you come out and meet me?

403
00:36:47,389 --> 00:36:49,490
Why did you lie for me?

404

At my place, I always have youngsters wanting to get in through the back door.

405
00:36:54,508 --> 00:36:56,990
I can feel your pneumatic power.

406
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:59,209
It has no killing intent.

407
00:36:59,209 --> 00:37:01,890
I think you're not targeting me.

408
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:04,109
I didn't talk about the back door.

409
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:06,990
I just want to ask you something.

410
00:37:10,129 --> 00:37:11,839
Did the Mountain and Sea Gang

411
00:37:13,349 --> 00:37:15,750
cause your injury?

412
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:19,830
You know about the Mountain and Sea Gang?

413
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:27,309
It's already in the past.

414
00:37:27,309 --> 00:37:31,079
Since you mentioned it, I'll tell you a story.

415
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:36,709
Three years ago, when I was the pugilist world,

416
00:37:36,709 --> 00:37:41,750
I saved a brilliant young man from the Mountain and Sea Gang.

417
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:57,489
However, a short while after I saved him,

418
00:37:57,489 --> 00:38:00,929
we encounter the people from Mountain and Sea Gang who were hunting us down.

419
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:13,030
I was outnumbered and got heavily injured.

420
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:15,010
I lost all my martial arts.

421
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:17,590
General Qin saved my life.

422
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:20,649
So I've been following him ever since.

423
00:38:20,649 --> 00:38:22,349
You lost your martial arts...

424
00:38:24,959 --> 00:38:27,659
it's to save that child.

425
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:30,950
It's only martial arts.

426
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:34,089
A person's life is more important.

427
00:38:34,089 --> 00:38:36,449
Although I no longer have martial arts,

428
00:38:37,859 --> 00:38:40,029
I still have my eyes.

429
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:42,958
General Qin treats me well.

430
00:38:42,959 --> 00:38:44,918
I can still contribute to the country.

431
00:38:44,919 --> 00:38:48,909
A loss can be a blessing in disguise.

Sir Wen,

433
00:38:59,349 --> 00:39:01,950
allow me to also tell you this old story.

434
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:04,530
Thirteen years ago,

435
00:39:06,309 --> 00:39:09,619
a lonely boy was kidnapped and brought to the Mountain and Sea Gang.

436
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:13,130
He was tortured for a long time.

437
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:15,909
He initially thought he was going to die there...

438
00:39:20,689 --> 00:39:23,429
until a hero came and saved him.

439
00:39:28,749 --> 00:39:30,949
After the boy was saved,

440
00:39:31,889 --> 00:39:34,829
he has been searching for his savior,

441
00:39:36,339 --> 00:39:38,569
but he couldn't find him.

442
00:39:39,349 --> 00:39:41,210
He only knows

443
00:39:43,749 --> 00:39:45,889
that his savior is called Dao. (TN: A thief)

It's really you.

446
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,949
You're still alive.

447
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:06,470

450
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:14,369
I found you.

451
00:40:59,829 --> 00:41:02,859
I wonder if the four "sauce boxes" (TN: a loving curse for his four disciples)

452
00:41:02,859 --> 00:41:06,549
were beaten black and blue or not.

453
00:41:08,479 --> 00:41:11,818
How can my disciples lose?

454
00:41:11,818 --> 00:41:15,890
The four of them have entered the second round.

455
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:22,559
All right!

Wind Taker Institute is going to be famous this time.

457
00:41:29,309 --> 00:41:33,609
Are you sure Lu Ping will fight for Wind Taker Institute in the end?

458
00:41:33,609 --> 00:41:37,009
You should know that he has a motive.

459
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:42,789
Don't I have a motive as well?

460
00:41:45,389 --> 00:41:48,230
What Lu Ping will choose in the end?

461
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:51,989
Let's wait and see!

462
00:42:10,869 --> 00:42:15,350
These past three years, Su Tang and I have been staying at the Wind Taker Institute.

463
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:17,969
Our master might be reckless,

00:42:17,969 --> 00:42:20,209
lazy, greedy, and a drunk,

00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:23,150
but he treats us very well.

466
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:25,709

474
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:19,920
♫ Waiting to be buried by the lake in the town, ♫

475
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:26,040
♫ the White Paper Boat drifting with sorrow. ♫

476
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:31,860
♫ Lights on the other side of the sea ♫

477
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:39,910
♫ punched fingertips in the red water tower. ♫

478
00:43:44,610 --> 00:43:49,940
♫ Watch the little boat churning, laughing at the ordinariness. ♫

479
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:54,240
♫ Like a kite being pulled into a low altitude, ♫

480
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:59,650
♫ I smiled to the leaving person. ♫

481
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:03,980
♫ The more spotlight, the more vivid the story. ♫

482
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:08,940
♫ Laughing like the moon, ♫

483
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:13,450
♫ regretting the lighthouse broke in the waves, ♫

484
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:20,910
♫ I call the Milky Way that isolates us all, blue. ♫

485
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:28,140
♫ Like a moat built under the sea, ♫

486
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:32,880
♫ waiting for the words on the paper boat to disappear, ♫

487
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:40,050
♫ there must always be someone who doesn’t remember listening to the other. ♫

488
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:47,620
♫ Anyone who is correctly guessed will end in disfavor. ♫

489
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:51,800
♫ You are particularly touched but others consider it ordinary. ♫

490
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:57,140
♫ Like the author, roughly put down with a weak stroke, ♫

491
00:44:57,140 --> 00:45:01,550
♫ the writing boat on the lake was just like a paper crane in the air. ♫

492
00:45:01,550 --> 00:45:06,400
♫ Laughing like the moon, ♫

493
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:11,030
♫ regretting the lighthouse broke in the waves, ♫

494
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:18,950
♫ I call the Milky Way that isolates us all, blue. ♫

495
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:26,040
♫ Can a moat be built on the seabed? ♫

496
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:30,380
♫ Wipe all the words on the paper boat! ♫

497
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:37,680
♫ Please let someone not remember and don't tell another! ♫

498
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:44,860
♫ Hide the reluctance between words ♫

499
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:49,440
♫ Unfortunately, I (you) are an average author ♫

500
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:57,380
♫ No matter how you (I) describe the rest, it's unnecessary! ♫

501
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:07,990
♫ Don't describe my unfulfilled promise! ♫

502
00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:16,820
♫ Don't interpret my hidden fire-smoke! ♫

503
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:25,760
♫ Don't let the paper boat in the rough wave chasing me! ♫

504
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:33,500
♫ Don't wait until it's over to know there are you and me! ♫
