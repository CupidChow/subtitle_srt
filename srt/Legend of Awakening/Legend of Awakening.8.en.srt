00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:28,880
♫ The dark green sea is hazy ♫

3
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,750
♫ dissipating in a flash. ♫

4
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:36,580
♫ Rivers and lakes divide the world. ♫

5
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:39,990
♫ Ten thousands arrows are firing at once. ♫

6
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:43,950
♫ Who has time to worry? Who loves the color of blood? ♫

7
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,750
♫ At that time, spirits are high. ♫

8
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:51,640
♫ Who calls the world his home? Who dares let his horse freely run? ♫

9
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,390
♫ Silently, tears form in the death of night. ♫

10
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,300
♫ Heroes are cutting all ties, ♫

11
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:02,050
♫ giving up whether it's life or death, ♫

12
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:04,180
♫ never asking what the cost is. ♫

13
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:09,860
♫ Good and evil must be distinguished. ♫

14
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:13,700
♫ The wind blows off the snow. ♫

15
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,510
♫ On the body, etch multiple scars, ♫

16
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,760
♫ wandering all over the world, ♫

17
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:25,280
♫ only wish to ask for answers from this world. ♫

18
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,230
♫ A teenager doesn't have to be a hero. ♫

19
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:33,040
♫ There is no need for flowers in the dream. ♫

20
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,180
♫ Destiny need not be afraid. ♫

21
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:40,810
♫ Because you have him all the way, ♫

22
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:44,660
♫ experienced a handful of conquests, ♫

23
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:48,550
♫ overcame a number of challenges. ♫

24
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:50,680
♫ From now on, happy and free! ♫

25
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:56,250
♫ The only wish is, with the world, ♫

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:00,630
♫ would come along the willing of change. ♫

[Episode 8]

29
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:25,019
Honorable guests?

30
00:02:26,979 --> 00:02:29,239
Are those the honorable guests you mentioned?

31
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:32,199
No matter what, I want the private seats.

32
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:35,540
Wei Hu, throw them out!

33
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:40,429
Young Lord Wei, Master instructed us that we must keep a low profile in Kaifeng.

34
00:02:40,429 --> 00:02:42,699
If you won't, I'll do it myself.

35
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,599
- Young Lord!
- Move aside!

36
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:51,679
- Young Lord, don't smash anything. Young Lord!
- Move!

37
00:02:55,139 --> 00:02:57,740
Excuse me! This is your congee.

38
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,740
- Young Master!
- Young Master!

39
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,420
- Young Master.
- Young Master.

40
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,380
You...

41
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:36,239
Shop Keeper, I'm taking the congee.

42
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,139
Elder.

43
00:03:45,139 --> 00:03:47,460
Thank you for standing up for us.

44
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,199
May I ask for your name?

45
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:50,879
Get lost!

46
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,699
Just tell me your name.

47
00:03:54,699 --> 00:03:56,819
I can tell that you're highly skilled.

48
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,120
I would like to learn from you.

49
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,700
Anyone who keeps me from having congee deserves to be beaten up.

50
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,119
Anyone who stands in my way...

51
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,039
deserves to be beaten up even more.

52
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:23,859
Brother, did you see her stances?

53
00:04:23,859 --> 00:04:26,700
No, she was too fast.

54
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,891
Not even Qin Sang could see clearly with her Pneuma of Vision.

55
00:04:29,891 --> 00:04:32,609
What happened? We're just having congee, how did it end up like this?

56
00:04:32,609 --> 00:04:34,700
How is it? Are you hurt?

57
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,278
Don't worry! I'll stand up for you. Who did it?

58
00:04:37,278 --> 00:04:41,439
Master, you're really good at acting in hindsight.

59
00:04:43,499 --> 00:04:45,660
What are you saying?

60
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,320
Wasn't I away getting things done for you?

61
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,938
So Master was actually away just now to get us a greeting gift.

62
00:04:54,938 --> 00:04:58,339
Yet, you can't come with us to Shining Sky Academy.

63
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,178
I am after all the Head of Wind Taker Institute.

64
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:05,919
How would they see me, if I take my own disciples to Shining Sky Academy?

65
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,219
Present this greeting gift!

66
00:05:08,219 --> 00:05:10,820
She will welcome you in person.

67
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,920
What gift is it?

68
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:20,020
It's fresh out of the oven, fresh and piping hot!

69
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,758
A snack? Is it sweet? Is it good?

70
00:05:22,758 --> 00:05:26,199
Master, we don't even know what Chu Min looks like.

71
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:28,210
How are we to ask her to be our mentor?

72
00:05:30,059 --> 00:05:31,800
Her?

73
00:05:33,379 --> 00:05:35,900
She's highly skilled in martial arts.

74
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,820
Her beauty is unsurpassed.

75
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:43,000
We shared many years of friendship.

76
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,260
On top of that, you're bringing her favorite gift to meet her.

77
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:50,279
She will definitely see you.

78
00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:02,080
I get it! Step out.

79
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:07,190
Miss, someone is going around the city scamming people with the Qin family's badge.

80
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:11,280
Someone is using the Qin family's gold badge to scam people in the city?

81
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:14,700
There is a woman and a few men among them, both young and old.

82
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,638
There is also someone with disabled legs.

83
00:06:16,638 --> 00:06:18,680
I know who they are.

84
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,659
I'll deal with it personally.

85
00:06:21,659 --> 00:06:24,639
I thought we would never meet again.

86

[Shining Sky Academy]

87
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,639
I heard the disciples of Shining Sky Academy are all from renowned families.

88
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:44,198
How is this about martial arts? It's more about family upbringing.

89
00:06:44,198 --> 00:06:48,178
It's no wonder that old geezer refused to come here, just because he is afraid to look bad.

90
00:06:48,178 --> 00:06:50,139
I think that it's pretty good at Wind Taker Institute.

91
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:53,780
For the first time in my life, I agree with Eldest Senior.

92
00:06:54,379 --> 00:06:56,518
Brother, let's go in quickly.

93
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:59,939
Didn't Master say the greeting gift can't wait and we have to deliver it to Chu Min as soon as possible?

94
00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:01,839
- All right!
- Let's go!

95
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,839
I believe everyone already knows, that the Qin family has gone overboard this time.

96
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:15,139
They are actually causing disciples from aristocratic families

97
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:18,780
compete together with those common people in the world.

98
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:23,599
Master told us that we must win the Pneumatic Combat Convention.

99
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,630
It's also to take the Qin family down a peg.

100
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,878
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

101
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:34,679
All of you who are present are all Master's disciples.

102
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,219
You're also peers who need a breakthrough in your Pneuma of Sound.

103
00:07:38,219 --> 00:07:41,958
Today, you'll practice with me, Luo Ting.

104
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:44,259
We'll make a breakthrough together.

105
00:07:44,259 --> 00:07:48,519
Noises are a hindrance, when making a breakthrough in Sound.

106
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:50,400
You must bear that in mind.

107
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,980
You must train your Pneuma of Sound to the highest level.

108
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,280
Thank you.

109
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,419
I've asked around.

110
00:08:10,419 --> 00:08:12,899
No one here knows Chu Min.

111
00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:15,379
They also assume that we're here as helpers.

112
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:17,800
What on earth did that old geezer say?

113
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,819
An unsurpassed beauty with great martial arts skills?

114
00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:21,460
Did he lie to us again?

115
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:26,338
I knew it! Whenever Master sounds so certain, nothing good ever happens.

116
00:08:26,338 --> 00:08:28,639
Let's head back to the inn first.

117
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:34,660
Whose servants are you?

118
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,978
Are you here to deliver gifts to Headmaster Xia?

119
00:08:36,978 --> 00:08:39,799
Or are you applying to get trained at Shining Sky Academy?

120
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:45,649
Leave the gift!

121
00:08:45,649 --> 00:08:47,810
You can go after giving me a name.

122
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:54,199
A gift from Guo Youdao!

123
00:08:54,199 --> 00:08:56,020
Don't touch it!

124

Who is it? Get him!

125
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:26,599
Senior Luo Ting, they are here to make a scene.

126
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:29,129
Who are you? How dare you barge into Shining Sky Academy?

127
00:09:29,129 --> 00:09:32,619
Our apologies! We're here to see someone.

128
00:09:32,619 --> 00:09:34,309
We didn't know this would happen.

129
00:09:34,309 --> 00:09:36,738
Tell us! Who are you looking for?

130
00:09:36,738 --> 00:09:40,559
We are here to seek out Elder Chu Min as our mentor.

131
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:42,440
Please take us to her.

132
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,498
Can't you even tell better lies?

133
00:09:44,498 --> 00:09:48,110
Here at Shining Sky Academy, we don't have any Master called Chu Min.

134
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:49,778
Judging by their scrubby looks,

135
00:09:49,778 --> 00:09:53,599
I bet they are thieves who want to sneak into Shining Sky Academy.

136
00:09:53,599 --> 00:09:57,619
Our peers nearly made a breakthrough in our Pneuma of Sound today to master two pneumatic powers.

137
00:09:57,619 --> 00:09:59,779
Now, look at what happened! You've sabotaged it.

138
00:09:59,779 --> 00:10:01,960
Master has fooled us again.

139
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:19,618
Take a good look at this! We're from the Qin family.

140
00:10:19,618 --> 00:10:22,000
Do we need to steal anything?

141
00:10:22,979 --> 00:10:26,890
Qin family and I are best friends.

142
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:30,690
They even found their way here! I would have to check you out.

00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:33,440
Mo Lin, harmony is prized.

144
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,858
Eldest Senior, it is pointless to reason with them now.

145
00:10:36,858 --> 00:10:39,399
Mo Lin, where is the safest spot?

146
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,720
What are you still waiting for?

147
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:50,210
Let's go! That's the quietest spot.

148

Disciples of Shining Sky Academy, listen up!

149
00:10:54,549 --> 00:10:56,479
Seal the doors and arrest the thieves!

Yes!

[Tripitaka Sutra Pavilion]

152
00:11:19,259 --> 00:11:22,339
People rarely come here, we should be able to hide for a while.

153
00:11:30,379 --> 00:11:32,799
Didn't the people at the inn say Lu Ping and the others went to Shining Sky Academy?

154

What is going on?

Hurry up! Don't let them get away!

156

Senior, what happened?

157
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,420
Some people with the Qin family's gold badge have offended Luo Ting.

158
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,040
All disciples in the academy are out to capture them.

- The backyard! They went towards the backyard.

There's a crowd in the backyard.

161
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,539
I'm afraid it's just a diversion.

162
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:54,940
We're doomed! We're trapped in here.

163
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,980
Won't we get surrounded?

166
00:12:05,739 --> 00:12:08,619
I tell you, Miss Qin, we're here to seek a mentor.

167
00:12:08,619 --> 00:12:12,559
Yet the disciples of Shining Sky Academy insisted that we're thieves, how is it reasonable?

168
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:17,060
You've been scamming with my gold badge in the city, how are you not thieves?

169
00:12:19,979 --> 00:12:22,819
Junior Qin, what a coincidence!

170
00:12:22,819 --> 00:12:25,240
It seems that you are always losing something.

171
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,120
These people are indeed thieves.

172
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:34,439
- Capture them!
- Hold on!

173

Luo Ting, wait a moment! They are my friends.

174
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:42,500
I believe they are telling the truth.

175
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,878
If there's any misunderstanding between you and them,

176
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:47,900
please let them off for my sake.

177
00:12:49,779 --> 00:12:51,979
So, they are actually your friends?

178
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:55,820
That's fine! Since they wish to join Shining Sky Academy,

179
00:12:55,820 --> 00:13:00,499
why don't I examine their abilities first according to the regulations?

180
00:13:00,499 --> 00:13:03,520
Junior, you won't mind, will you?

181

- You're that Chu Min, the one our master told us?
- Do not be rude!

193
00:14:48,038 --> 00:14:51,540
Although Master Chu Min is a librarian in our Tripitaka Sutra Pavilion,

194
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:54,220
she's the most powerful warrior in Shining Sky Academy.

195

Elder Xia, we're here to see Elder Chu Min.

We didn't expect to offend your disciples.

Please don't take it to heart.

He has got us a powerful figure. Let's go!

202

We were referred by the Head of Wind Taker Institute, Guo Youdao.

We hope Elder Chu Min can take us in as your disciples.

I'm in pain. Look!

It hurts so much.

208
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:33,520
Master, what are you doing here?

209
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:38,879
Guo Youdao, do you really think that by tricking them into offending the entire Shining Sky Academy,

210
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:41,539
I'd feel bad enough to take them as my disciples?

211
00:16:41,539 --> 00:16:43,320
No, Minmin...

212
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:47,060
Master, you wanted to fool us from the start, right?

213
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,479
I...

214
00:16:48,479 --> 00:16:51,539
Wasn't I trying to get you started in seeking a mentor?

215
00:16:55,879 --> 00:17:02,279
Minmin... You've been alone all these years.

216
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:05,379
If you take in a few disciples now, isn't that pretty nice?

217
00:17:05,379 --> 00:17:08,560
It will get lively, right? What do you say?

218
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,379
Am I right, Minmin?

219
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:25,470
Minmin, why did you hit me?

So what if we saw her?

00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:23,139
I thought that it's already outstanding to master one pneumatic power.

Who knew that it's not worth mentioning at all in Kaifeng?

I think that with your brother's standard, he won't even get through the first round.

Why don't you come with me to make a living in the pugilist world?

Since we returned from Shining Sky Academy,

brother hasn't said a word.

It's obvious that there's a disparity in their skills.

Haven't you wondered why someone who lived in such seclusion

272
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:40,540
would run into us so coincidentally at the congee restaurant?

273
00:20:43,179 --> 00:20:46,819
I've asked around, Chu Min has been in Shining Sky Academy for about ten years.

274
00:20:46,819 --> 00:20:49,820
At this time of the year, she would always buy crab congee there.

275
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:53,079
She kept such a persistent habit, she must have an obsession.

276
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:56,120
It's just that the owner of the congee place was so startled,

277
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,899
so he closed the place and headed back to his hometown.

Speaking of which, Eldest Senior, I bully you all the time,

Whatever danger we are in, you always whine about it, but you have never failed to protect us.

I thought to myself, I'll have to keep leading Wind Taker Institute.

You can't do it or are you afraid?

316
00:24:46,019 --> 00:24:48,360
Do you think I'll be prodded into helping?

317
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,420
Watch out!

318
00:25:28,839 --> 00:25:33,600
Is this how you help me? Ms. Qin is starting a fire?

319
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,880
Aren't you afraid to look bad?

320
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:40,519
It's my fault that you didn't get accepted as disciples today.

321
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:44,679
When anyone in Qin family is in the wrong, we have to take responsibility.

322
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,900
Talk after you have cleaned your face.

323
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:05,979
Silly girl!

324
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:09,940
Master Guo's trick didn't work on Chu Min.

325
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:14,519
But we used your gold badge... I'm sorry.

326
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:23,040
You... You rascal... You actually apologized to me?

327
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:26,619
What did you say? Say it again! I didn't hear you clearly.

328
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,519
I said...

329
00:26:39,459 --> 00:26:42,040
The fire died, put more wood in.

330
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:45,079
Right! Yes.

331
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:53,460
Who lit the stove? Is this meant for cooking or burning the house down?

332
00:26:58,079 --> 00:26:59,920
Are you trying to burn the house down?

333
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:03,680
Who was here? Step aside! I'll help you.

334
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,660
Sure, I'll leave you to it! I'm off.

335
00:27:15,459 --> 00:27:16,900
Brother!

336
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:27,300
Su Tang, I've lost this bag of money for some time, where did you find it?

337
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:31,180
Brother, was Ms. Qin here?

338
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:35,958
You're still acting? I've checked them! These are all government taels.

339
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:42,040
Well done! Your observation skills have improved.

340
00:27:44,899 --> 00:27:47,939
She is worried that we'll keep putting expenses on a tab and make the Qin family look bad.

341
00:27:47,939 --> 00:27:50,200
She came specially to bring us money.

342
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:55,619
With this rich sponsor, I can even reserve the entire Osmanthus Candy Shop for you.

343
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:05,079
Has Ms. Qin... fallen for you?

344
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:09,219
Have you also fallen for her?

345
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,920
Brother, are you not going to get a mentor?

346
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,680
Are you using her to meet Wen Gecheng?

347
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,639
Su Tang.

348
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,850
The path I choose...

349
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:23,520
it can't be changed.

350
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:30,739
The Qin family's young lady and us might seem to be on a similar path,

351
00:28:30,739 --> 00:28:33,590
but in the end, it won't be the same.

352
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:35,320
Do you understand?

353
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:45,880

I didn't bring you crab congee this year.

359
00:29:17,319 --> 00:29:21,299
You always said the congee was made for me.

360
00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:27,720
But I knew, you actually missed the flavors of your hometown.

361
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,300

as you age, your wisdom grows.

371

But now that we've both aged,

372
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:28,700
there's still a lot we can't comprehend.

373
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,540
For instance,

374
00:30:32,419 --> 00:30:35,239
the dead are gone.

375
00:30:35,239 --> 00:30:37,540
You should move on.

376
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:42,879
Guo Youdao.

377
00:30:44,419 --> 00:30:47,079
These past few years, you have been drinking...

378
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:50,319
no less than I did.

379
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:54,460
I drink to forget the past.

380
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:56,140
You drink...

381
00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:02,639
to live in the past.

382
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:10,759
There are thousands of philosophies on life in this world.

383
00:31:10,759 --> 00:31:13,160
I don't have to understand them all.

384
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:18,599
Stop trying to talk me around! It has been ten years...

385
00:31:19,859 --> 00:31:23,680
I no longer hold any aspirations.

386
00:31:25,659 --> 00:31:28,960
My heart is dead.

387
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,280
How can I have the heart to take in disciples?

388
00:31:39,219 --> 00:31:41,319
Don't be in a rush to leave!

389
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:48,219
You've drunk so much wine.

390
00:31:49,179 --> 00:31:51,299
It's time to eat.

391
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,940
Have another bowl of crab congee.

392
00:31:57,479 --> 00:32:03,460
I can't... If I keep eating, I'll die from overeating before I get a mentor.

393
00:32:07,179 --> 00:32:09,880
You've used up your pneumatic power?

394
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,559
Listen! I...

395
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:20,758
Brother, we've tried so many times.

396
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:23,518
It still doesn't taste like the congee from the restaurant.

397
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:25,580
There are plenty more fish in the sea.

398
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:28,930
Why don't we pick another mentor?

399
00:32:28,939 --> 00:32:33,698
I don't want to change the path I've chosen, do you want to see Master Guo bullied?

400
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,898
Every year, Master Guo comes to Kaifeng, he always ends up getting bruised.

401
00:32:39,898 --> 00:32:45,020
Yet, he still keeps coming, Elder Chu Min must mean a lot to him.

402
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:48,800
Let's keep going!

403
00:32:52,379 --> 00:32:54,080
Here, come...

404
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,600
Hurry up! Come.

405
00:32:57,379 --> 00:32:59,079
Look!

406
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:05,239
Look at these kids! They are so serious.

407
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,839
Aren't they like our younger selves?

408
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:50,418
I've got it! Mo Lin! Don't you have all sorts of poisons?

409
00:33:50,418 --> 00:33:54,538
Is there a colorless and odorless one we can put in the congee that will make Chu Min let us...

410
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:04,420
Minmin...

411
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:10,978
Elder Chu Min, we've made you crab congee. Please try some!

412
00:34:12,319 --> 00:34:13,819
Please!

413
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:34,719
No... Don't!

414
00:34:37,219 --> 00:34:39,229
That's enough, Minmin!

415
00:34:42,739 --> 00:34:47,158
This crab congee is a token of these youngsters' sincerity.

416
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:49,979
Are you going to waste it?

417
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:25,119
What's going on?

418
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,809
She's not responding.

419
00:35:28,429 --> 00:35:31,100
Did you really poison her?

420
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:37,860
Meet me at Tripitaka Sutra Pavilion tomorrow.

421
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,800
Quick-quick-quickly address your Master!

422
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,638
- Mast—
- I'm not your Master.

423
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:47,820
Nor am I some deity.

424
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:51,038
It's only a few days away from the Pneuma Combat Convention.

425
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:53,618
If you wish to enhance your pneumatic powers rapidly,

426
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:57,719
I know of a method that isn't really a method.

427
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,769
Think it through and then come to me.

428
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,559
Minmin.

429
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:15,599
Minmin, does it taste like it once did?

430
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:19,898
Your disciples, none of them can cook.

431
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:28,520
But the boiling temperature of the freshly made congee,

432
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,239
it's still quite interesting.

433
00:36:39,819 --> 00:36:43,778
Luo Ting, it seems you're holding it against me?

434
00:36:43,778 --> 00:36:46,488
I just feel bad for you.

435
00:36:46,488 --> 00:36:50,139
You are a high-ranking official of Shuo State, so His Majesty should rely on you the most.

436
00:36:50,139 --> 00:36:53,979
But Qin Qi made a name for himself at the Pneuma Combat Convention.

437
00:36:53,979 --> 00:36:57,129
I also have no choice, but to show Qin Sang respect.

438
00:36:57,129 --> 00:37:00,819
Those scoundrels even made a racket in Shining Sky Academy, this really is...

439
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:03,579
It made you look bad.

440
00:37:03,579 --> 00:37:07,199
Do you still remember what it is that I often taught you?

441
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:11,139
Bide your time, gear up for the moment!

442
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,479
Those kids from Wind Taker Institute, they are but mediocre in martial arts.

443
00:37:16,479 --> 00:37:20,879
They came to seek a mentor just to participate in the Pneuma Combat Convention.

444
00:37:20,879 --> 00:37:25,560
If you're Chu Min, and had a short time to enhance your powers,

445
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,840
what would you do?

446
00:37:30,519 --> 00:37:36,178
Master, you mean... Lu Ping and his peers will take a risk in using that banned skill?

447
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:41,198
Who humbled herself to speak up for Lu Ping?

448
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:43,329
Do you remember?

449
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:49,440
Get up!

450
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:54,388
There are some matters that I have to handle on my own.

451
00:37:54,388 --> 00:38:00,250
But you must remember that schemes can kill better than weapons.

452
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:04,138
Politics is way more complicated than what in the pugilist world.

453
00:38:04,138 --> 00:38:07,800
How difficult can it be to kill someone?

454
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,189
Minmin, please enjoy!

455
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:26,289
This is... Soul Splitting Technique?

456
00:38:26,769 --> 00:38:28,579
Exactly!

457
00:38:28,579 --> 00:38:30,939
There's not much time left.

458
00:38:30,939 --> 00:38:35,618
Judging by your current skills, you're seeking your doom by participating in the convention.

459
00:38:35,618 --> 00:38:39,439
The only solution is to split your pneumatic power.

460
00:38:39,439 --> 00:38:40,650
What is Soul Splitting?

461
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:46,870
Soul Splitting Technique uses an external Pneuma to bear the pneumatic power down and enhance it in a short time.

462
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:50,418
It is to aid in mastering one pneumatic power or even mastering many at a time.

463
00:38:50,418 --> 00:38:53,819
It can promise instant results but it's also very risky.

464
00:38:53,819 --> 00:38:56,319
This is an officially banned skill.

465
00:38:56,319 --> 00:38:57,820
How risky can it be?

466
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:00,500
The least impact is losing all five senses.

467
00:39:00,508 --> 00:39:02,959
The worst is...

468
00:39:02,959 --> 00:39:05,609
losing your life.

469
00:39:07,329 --> 00:39:09,840
Do you still wish to gamble?

470
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,500
Then place your bets.

471
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:16,858
Getting killed in the convention or here, what difference does it make?

472
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:19,679
I'll take the risk.

473
00:39:20,279 --> 00:39:22,159
I'll go along with my brother.

474
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:25,488
Eldest Senior, are you going along with this crazy plan?

475
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,808
The methodology in martial arts is like an instrument.

476
00:39:27,808 --> 00:39:31,289
As long as you bear no ill will, then all restriction is off.

477
00:39:31,289 --> 00:39:34,178
You're just trying to make me join you.

478
00:39:34,178 --> 00:39:36,359
I'm not a fool.

479
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:40,099
You talk too much.

480
00:39:40,099 --> 00:39:43,179
You call yourself the best assassin in the world?

481
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:52,820
Miss, you should practice your swordplay.

482
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:54,519
Got it!

483
00:39:54,519 --> 00:39:57,939
Are you worried about Young Master Lu and the others?

484
00:39:57,939 --> 00:40:01,039
Why don't you plead on their behalf?

485
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:03,060
Why should I help him?

486
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:05,289
Did he ask me for help?

487
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:13,020
Luo Ting? He never gets up early to practice swordplay.

488
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:15,520
Why is he acting differently today?

489
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:19,000
Miss, he is going towards the Tripitaka Sutra Pavilion.

490
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:24,618
Not good! Luo Ting is narrow-minded and vengeful.

491
00:40:24,618 --> 00:40:26,680
I fear that he might harm Lu Ping.

492
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,319
Let's follow him!

493
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:43,919
Where is he?

494
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:49,840
[Tripitaka Sutra Pavilion]

495
00:41:54,809 --> 00:41:56,820
What is that sound?

496
00:42:07,179 --> 00:42:11,140
Ms. Qin, what are you doing here?

497
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:14,088
Lu Ping, do you know what you're doing?

498
00:42:14,088 --> 00:42:17,438
Soul Splitting is banned! It can kill you.

499
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:23,438
Fine! You'd risk your life for the convention?

500
00:42:23,438 --> 00:42:25,829
I'll report this to my brother right now.

501
00:42:38,378 --> 00:42:41,138
-This...
- Once the Soul Splitting begins,

502
00:42:41,138 --> 00:42:44,028
you'll get a backlash if it's stopped halfway.

503
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:48,859
Ms. Qin, right now, you can only join them.

504
00:42:48,859 --> 00:42:53,618
Moreover, you'll be marked with an imprint of blocked meridians.

505
00:42:53,618 --> 00:42:59,818
If you can't make a breakthrough within a day, you'll live with that mark for life.

506
00:42:59,818 --> 00:43:02,719
The Soul Splitting has begun.

507
00:43:02,719 --> 00:43:05,579
Life and death are now in the hands of fate.

509
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:04,560
♫ Waiting to be buried by the lake in the town, ♫

510
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:10,570
♫ the White Paper Boat drifting with sorrow. ♫

511
00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:16,440
♫ Lights on the other side of the sea ♫

512
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:25,070
♫ punched fingertips in the red water tower. ♫

513
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:34,410
♫ Watch the little boat churning, laughing at the ordinariness. ♫

514
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:38,810
♫ Like a kite being pulled into a low altitude, ♫

515
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:44,200
♫ I smiled to the leaving person. ♫

516
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:48,480
♫ The more spotlight, the more vivid the story. ♫

517
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:53,490
♫ Laughing like the moon, ♫

518
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:57,940
♫ regretting the lighthouse broke in the waves, ♫

519
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:05,260
♫ I call the Milky Way that isolates us all, blue. ♫

520
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:12,700
♫ Like a moat built under the sea, ♫

521
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:17,470
♫ waiting for the words on the paper boat to disappear, ♫

522
00:45:17,470 --> 00:45:25,290
♫ there must always be someone who doesn’t remember listening to the other. ♫

523
00:45:26,570 --> 00:45:32,140
♫ Anyone who is correctly guessed will end in disfavor. ♫

524
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:36,330
♫ You are particularly touched but others consider it ordinary. ♫

525
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:41,560
♫ Like the author, roughly put down with a weak stroke, ♫

526
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:46,090
♫ the writing boat on the lake was just like a paper crane in the air. ♫

527
00:45:46,090 --> 00:45:50,940
♫ Laughing like the moon, ♫

528
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:55,630
♫ regretting the lighthouse broke in the waves, ♫

529
00:45:55,630 --> 00:46:03,640
♫ I call the Milky Way that isolates us all, blue. ♫

530
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:10,580
♫ Can a moat be built on the seabed? ♫

531
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:14,840
♫ Wipe all the words on the paper boat! ♫

532
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:22,360
♫ Please let someone not remember and don't tell another! ♫

533
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:29,390
♫ Hide the reluctance between words ♫

534
00:46:29,390 --> 00:46:34,050
♫ Unfortunately, I (you) are an average author ♫

535
00:46:34,050 --> 00:46:42,450
♫ No matter how you (I) describe the rest, it's unnecessary! ♫

536
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:52,590
♫ Don't describe my unfulfilled promise! ♫

537
00:46:52,590 --> 00:47:01,380
♫ Don't interpret my hidden fire-smoke! ♫

538
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:10,330
♫ Don't let the paper boat in the rough wave chasing me! ♫

539
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:18,930
♫ Don't wait until it over to know there are you and me! ♫
