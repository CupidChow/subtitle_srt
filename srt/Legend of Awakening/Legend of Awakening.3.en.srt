00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,780
♫ The dark green sea is hazy ♫

3
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:32,750
♫ dissipating in a flash. ♫

4
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:36,580
♫ Rivers and lakes divide the world. ♫

5
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:40,000
♫ Ten thousands arrows are firing at once. ♫

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,970
♫ Who has time to worry? Who loves the color of blood? ♫

7
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:47,860
♫ At that time, spirits are high. ♫

8
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:51,660
♫ Who calls the world his home? Who dares let his horse freely run? ♫

9
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,400
♫ Silently, tears form in the death of night. ♫

10
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,300
♫ Heroes are cutting all ties, ♫

11
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:02,110
♫ giving up whether it's life or death, ♫

12
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:04,230
♫ never asking what the cost is. ♫

13
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:09,860
♫ Good and evil must be distinguished. ♫

14
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:13,760
♫ The wind blows off the snow. ♫

15
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,620
♫ On the body, etch multiple scars, ♫

16
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,780
♫ wandering all over the world, ♫

17
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:25,260
♫ only wish to ask for answers from this world. ♫

18
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:29,200
♫ A teenager doesn't have to be a hero. ♫

19
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,120
♫ There is no need for flowers in the dream. ♫

20
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,180
♫ Destiny need not be afraid. ♫

21
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:40,550
♫ Because you have him all the way, ♫

22
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:44,770
♫ experienced a handful of conquests, ♫

23
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:48,620
♫ overcame a number of challenges. ♫

24
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,710
♫ From now on, happy and free! ♫

25

[Legend of Awakening]

28
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,119
[Episode 3]

29
00:02:23,119 --> 00:02:24,440
Since we're tracking someone down,

30
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:29,500
we'll need specific experts in that field.

31
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,869
Miss, Young Lord Wei said he has posted wanted posters

32
00:02:31,869 --> 00:02:34,739
from the east to the west of the city.

33
00:02:35,419 --> 00:02:38,999
Perhaps, offering a reward might really work?

34
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,680
Who is it?

35
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,500
Please spare me, heroine!

36
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,660
I am Mo Lin.

37
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,820
I came here because of the poster.

38
00:03:06,999 --> 00:03:08,940
The wanted poster is truly exceptional.

39
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,480
They are posted from the east to the west of the city.

40
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,900
The words written are even bigger than my head.

41
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,220
Reading it makes me stressed out.

42
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:17,318
It took me a good half of the day to tear all the posters down.
[Mo Lin - An Assassin]

43
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:19,000
I couldn't let anyone else benefit...

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,779
No. I couldn't let anyone take the reward.

45
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,139
Heroine.

46
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,060
You possess no Pneuma of Strength at all.

47
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,839
Just do what you're capable of.

48
00:03:37,839 --> 00:03:40,960
No need to take this poster seriously, you also don't have the ability.

49
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,140
You can't question my talent, just because I'm imperfect.

50
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:50,080
My poor situation and poverty are temporary.

51
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,480
But I'm excellent at finding people, one among ten thousand people.

52
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:57,798
- Ling Ziyan, take him hostage and send him to the officials.
- Yes.

53
00:03:57,798 --> 00:03:59,420
Get up!

54
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:11,918
You woke up and refreshed yourself at dawn.

55
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,839
You didn't use willow to brush your mouth like everyone does; instead, you used peach blossom stem.

56
00:04:14,839 --> 00:04:18,718
You went out in the morning; besides being accompanied by this lady, four other men were with you.

57
00:04:18,718 --> 00:04:22,799
First, you went to an iron forge, then traveled across half of Chan State from south to north.

58
00:04:22,799 --> 00:04:25,650
Senses! You excel in the Pneuma of Pivot.

59
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:27,519
During lunch time, you were at the north of the city at Pinxian Restaurant.

60
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:31,449
The dishes were sea bass sashimi, glazed crab, wicked chicken, black rice, almond panna cotta, and shredded pickles.

61
00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:34,919
But it seems like you had a bad appetite, you gave each dish less than three bites.

62
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:36,799
But you did have a bowl of cold noodles with pagoda leaves.

63
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,479
You went out of town in the afternoon.

64
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,169
About two miles away, you passed by a flower field of common peonies.

65
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:44,119
You stood in front of a white common peony for around 15 minutes.

66
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,939
Then you passed by a purple one, and you went... east!

67
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:51,359
You only come back to Chan State in the evening.

68
00:04:51,359 --> 00:04:56,419
- What else?
- There's something in your waistband that doesn't belong to you.

69
00:05:08,859 --> 00:05:10,719
I'm looking for the best of the best.

70
00:05:10,719 --> 00:05:13,639
Even if you smelled something, but had yourself killed,

71
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:16,020
what does that benefit me?

72
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,979
You get to keep her alive.

73
00:05:23,939 --> 00:05:26,879
- When did you poison her?
- When I came to the residence at midnight.

74
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:29,810
I told you, I truly am an assassin.

75
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:32,679
If you hire me now, I'll be at your command.

76
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,060
So, I will have to save your servant; how's that?

77
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,399
Am I qualified now?

78
00:05:40,499 --> 00:05:42,499
- It hurts!
- Do you know who I am?

79
00:05:42,499 --> 00:05:45,859
Ling Ziyan is the maid who guards my sword and is not just someone anybody can touch.

80
00:05:45,859 --> 00:05:50,660
I have the antidote! As for the money... You can pay me less.

81
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:55,860
I'll hire you.

82
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,260
But next time, watch your attitude.

83
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,860
Ziyan.

84
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,680
Wake up!

85
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:19,980
How can she take such a big pill?

86
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,420
Sir, he indeed is one of us.
[Wei Ming - Security Guard/Butler of Wei Household]

87
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:43,780
We couldn't tell because his Mountain and Sea Badge was taken.

88
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,438
Why did Miss Qin say

89
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:48,799
the one who tried to harm her is an undercover of Mountain and Sea Gang?

90
00:06:48,799 --> 00:06:54,420
Could it be that His Lord set another undercover in Chan State?

91
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:57,259
Sir, you've been in Chan State for years under our Lord's orders,

92
00:06:57,259 --> 00:06:59,539
collecting information in the name of doing business.

93
00:06:59,539 --> 00:07:01,499
Even if he sent other men from our gang,

94
00:07:01,499 --> 00:07:04,079
I'm certain they would've informed you.

95
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:06,838
Besides, if he really is a part of the gang,

96
00:07:06,838 --> 00:07:09,299
why would he kill one of us?

97
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,679
This is too suspicious! We have to report to His Lord immediately.

98
00:07:14,679 --> 00:07:18,739
The Wei family will cease to exist if His Lord gets angered.

99
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:22,699
Wei Ming, send men to keep an eye on Miss Qin.

100
00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:25,139
No matter who she runs into,

101
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:27,539
no matter friend or enemy, bring them back to me.

102
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:29,739
We can never let the Qin family have them!

103
00:07:29,739 --> 00:07:31,139
Yes, sir.

104
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:58,040
[Mountain and Sea Tower (TN: Mountain and Sea Gang's place)]

105
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,620
Chief! An emergency message from Chan State.
[Lin Tianyi - Mountain and Sea Gang, Mountain Division Leader]

106
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,560
Situ Chong was murdered in Chenqiao.

107
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,259
And his Mountain and Sea Badge is stolen!

108
00:08:20,619 --> 00:08:23,819
Impossible! Situ Chong has mastered three Pneumas.
[Zhou Youlong - Mountain and Sea Gang, Fire Division Leader]

109
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:26,519
No one in Chenqiao could rival him!

110
00:08:29,539 --> 00:08:31,279
Chief!

111
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:37,259
Forgive me, Chief! I will send Xing Luo, the best man

112
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:40,160
in the Fire Division down there right away.

113
00:08:41,899 --> 00:08:45,350
How dare he touch what belongs to Mountain and Sea Gang.
[Yan Jin - Mountain and Sea Gang Chief Leader]

114
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:48,659
Just send him to the underworld, then.

115
00:08:55,719 --> 00:08:57,479
[Wind Taker Institute]

116
00:08:57,479 --> 00:09:01,190
I think this is the place and the smell here is the strongest.

117
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:02,859
[Closed]

118
00:09:02,859 --> 00:09:04,979
Closed?

119
00:09:04,979 --> 00:09:08,299
It's early in the morning but the door is locked.

120
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:10,350
Something is not right.

121
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,900
Forget it!

122
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:43,359
The unparalleled martial artist live in such a shabby place?

123
00:09:43,359 --> 00:09:47,310
Dear God, grant me some luck!

124
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,438
Young Lord Zhao, is Master Guo really not here?

125
00:09:51,438 --> 00:09:53,380
Don't you lie to me!

126
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,300
Madam Jin, please!

127
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,640
Master is really not here.

128
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,450
I almost died and your master doesn't care at all?

129
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:16,990
He sent you guys to save me, but he didn't even leave me a message?

130
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,430
He did!

131
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:22,719
But Master said relationships cost a lot of money,

132
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,219
- so please pay the commission at once.
- Okay.

133
00:10:26,219 --> 00:10:30,480
I admire talented men like him.

134
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,559
Come on, kid!

135
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:40,179
You have such a handsome appearance but why can't you be sweeter?

136
00:10:41,119 --> 00:10:44,199
If you keep calling me Madam in the future,

137
00:10:44,199 --> 00:10:46,860
then I will get upset.

138
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,600
- Madam Jin.
- Fine!

139
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,209
I... just wanted you to praise me in front of your master.

140
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:58,239
In fact, from the very beginning, I knew you're a good kid.

141
00:10:58,239 --> 00:11:00,799
Unlike that... God of Bandits.

142
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:02,659
He always appears and disappears unpredictably.

143
00:11:02,659 --> 00:11:05,399
I knew he's a cunning man the minute I saw him.

144
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,859
That's true! It is rather odd.

145
00:11:07,859 --> 00:11:10,200
Even though the God of Bandits isn't a man with good morals

146
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,719
but he is always willing to help the Wind Takers.

147
00:11:13,719 --> 00:11:17,579
Because of that, he has my gratitude.

148
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:18,979
What a funny guy you are!

149
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:23,559
This is the first time I hear someone praising a bad man!

150
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:25,739
All right! I'll stop teasing you now.

151
00:11:25,739 --> 00:11:27,519
I'm leaving.

152
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,450
By the way, don't forget to bring your master later

153
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:34,890
over to Ruyu House when he is free.

154
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,100
God of Bandits?

155
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,580
Ruyu House?

156
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,178
Ms. Qin, I have found the culprit's hiding place.

157
00:11:59,178 --> 00:12:01,139
All you need to do is send me 20 strong men.

158
00:12:01,139 --> 00:12:03,579
I have my own way to capture him.

159
00:12:03,579 --> 00:12:06,660
Please wait for my good news at Ruyu House of Chenqiao Town.

160
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,819
He's asking you for 20 strong men?

161
00:12:09,819 --> 00:12:12,900
Is Mo Lin going to break in forcefully?

162
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:16,779
Brother once told me, "Don't hire doubtful men and don't doubt your men."

163
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:18,638
If he wants 20 men, we'll give him 20 men.

164
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:23,079
But we're not in Kaifeng, where can we find that many men?

165
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:26,260
- You see, aren't they here?
- Sangsang!

166
00:12:34,979 --> 00:12:37,199
I heard you're in need of something.

167
00:12:37,199 --> 00:12:40,659
I'm willing to do whatever it takes to help you.

168
00:12:50,819 --> 00:12:54,218
Brother, it hasn't been half a month since you beat that man of Mountain and Sea Gang.

169
00:12:54,218 --> 00:12:58,440
Your Pneuma of Strength has yet to recover and now you're going to see Miss Qin, are you looking for a beating?

170
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,259
I missed her once already, if I wait longer, I'll miss this second chance.

171
00:13:02,259 --> 00:13:05,939
But you don't even know where she is, what if she is gone?

172
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:10,099
Then who else made a scene and posted the reward all over town?

173
00:13:10,099 --> 00:13:13,940
Only the Wei Family has the money and the manpower to do that.

174
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:17,679
My guess is Miss Qin is giving out orders in the Wei Residence right now.

175
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:21,919
Fortunately, Master is not around these few days; I'll sweet-talk or force her, if necessary, into coming back with me,

176
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:24,800
and I'll ask her to bring us to see Wen Gecheng.

177
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,939

178
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:28,539
Brother!

179
00:13:29,139 --> 00:13:32,710
Lu Ping, where are you going?

180
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:35,999
I admit I was too strict with you, I promise I'll teach you well.

181
00:13:35,999 --> 00:13:39,778
Even if afterward, you don't get the Pneuma of Strength, it's still good for strengthening your body.

182
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,840
Then will you let me eat something first?

183
00:13:43,599 --> 00:13:46,710
- I'll eat with you.
- I should go to the restroom first then.

184
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:48,420
That's good!

185

I can join you, too.

186
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:57,459
Eldest Senior, it's better if you keep ignoring me like you always do.

187
00:13:57,459 --> 00:14:01,460
A loser like me isn't worth your time.

188
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,899
Master asked me to take care of you before he left.

189
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:06,419
He wants me to start a step by step beginning with your life first,

190
00:14:06,419 --> 00:14:08,339
to help you cultivate good habits.

191
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:11,539
That might help improve your martial art skills as well.

192
00:14:11,539 --> 00:14:14,779
Your place is too shabby.

193
00:14:14,779 --> 00:14:18,440
How about I move over and stay with you for the night?

194
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:23,039
All right! Okay!

195
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:26,878
- Then, allow me to introduce the surroundings to you, Senior Brother.
- Sure.

196

- Lu Ping!
- I'll stop him.

- Senior Brother! Senior Brother, something happened!

Why was I so greedy back in those days?

I took shelter with the Mountain and Sea Gang.

However, it's no problem.

I can endure it as long as Tianqi is safe and sound.

God of Bandits, I respect you for being a good man.

235
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,739
You were being chivalrous to help the weak but you also robbed people.

236

You do good deeds but you never show who you are.

237
00:17:06,239 --> 00:17:08,660
Is there a reason why you are hiding?

It doesn't matter.

We both are like-minded, why can't you show yourself?

How did you get hurt?

It's nothing serious! The bandits did it.

243

I have no idea whom I had offended to become wanted.

If she was taken away because of me, wouldn't I be a laughing stock?

Eldest Senior, It's true that someone in Chenqiao is giving out

247
00:17:48,138 --> 00:17:50,970
a reward for people who capture the God of Bandits.

Eldest Senior, his brave deeds got him injured.

249

If we leave him like this, it's injustice.

By the way, Young Lord Zhao, didn't you tell me last time that

254
00:18:10,639 --> 00:18:12,379
you respect the God of Bandits a lot?

255

That you wouldn't mind even if he drew a turtle on your face?

316
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:14,039
In the end, you still can't escape my backup plan, will you?

317
00:25:22,839 --> 00:25:24,520
I knew it!

318
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:27,319
I never miss a target.

319
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,719
- How did you do it?
- Isn't it magical?

320
00:25:31,719 --> 00:25:34,518
I planted these worm grass here especially for you.

321
00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:36,199
Its root can alternate the dirt.

322
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,500
As long as you fall into this kind of quicksand,

323
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,800
no matter how good your Pneuma of Strength is,

324
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,900
you can't escape easily.

325
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:49,139
You study these stuff because you don't have the Pneuma of Strength.

326
00:25:49,139 --> 00:25:50,979
Don't you look down on me!

327
00:25:50,979 --> 00:25:54,180
Even though I lack one Pneuma, it doesn't mean I can't make up for it.

328
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:58,459
I'm telling you! One day, I will become the world's number one assassin.

329
00:25:58,459 --> 00:26:02,099
But, congratulations! I don't kill normal, unarmed people.

330
00:26:02,099 --> 00:26:04,898
Consider your life saved today.

331
00:26:04,898 --> 00:26:08,359
I'll tie you up and send you over to see Miss Qin at Ruyu House.

332
00:26:09,219 --> 00:26:11,119
What are you laughing about?

333
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:12,979
Congratulations to you, too!

334
00:26:12,979 --> 00:26:15,619
Consider your life saved today as well.

335
00:26:26,379 --> 00:26:28,739
Your power... You're not just a skilled martial artist.

336
00:26:28,739 --> 00:26:30,640
Who are you exactly?

337
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,839
I'm just a normal guy.

338
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:36,699
As for now, I'm going to bed.

339
00:26:37,259 --> 00:26:40,918
Isn't that my money? Give it back! Give it back!

340
00:26:40,918 --> 00:26:43,761
Think of it as my payment for spending the night with you.

341
00:26:43,761 --> 00:26:47,000
As you know already, I'm short on money.

342
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:50,159
You must have some sort of secrets to make you hide over here.

343
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,260
Aren't you afraid I'll tell on you for doing this to me?

344
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,879
You can try.

345
00:26:56,879 --> 00:26:59,939
Tell them! Lu Ping is the greatest martial artist

346
00:26:59,939 --> 00:27:02,060
and see who'd believe you.

347
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:08,239
Besides, who knows when you can escape?

348
00:27:08,239 --> 00:27:10,078
Brat! Come back!

349
00:27:10,078 --> 00:27:12,340
Free me!

350
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:28,259
Ms. Qin, the mission has gone on to a wrong path.

351
00:27:28,259 --> 00:27:31,059
I never thought Lu Ping is actually a tough rival.

352
00:27:31,059 --> 00:27:34,179
Difficult situations are hard to describe in few words,

353
00:27:34,179 --> 00:27:36,238
but I believe mankind can control his own destiny.

354
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:40,338
With my perseverance, I'm sure I can conquer the difficulties and accomplish the mission.

355
00:27:55,099 --> 00:27:57,920
[Surpass Big Dippers']

356
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:13,659
The valiance of Wind Takers surpasses that of the Big Dippers!

357
00:29:13,659 --> 00:29:14,879
The valiance of Wind Takers—

358
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,420
This man hides among the Wind Takers with a fake name.

359
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:19,540
He must be keeping some secrets.

360
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:23,338
I wrote him a letter, threatening him to meet me at the pavilion.

361
00:29:23,338 --> 00:29:25,858
I plan on setting a mechanism with all I've got

362
00:29:25,858 --> 00:29:28,539
and I'll brush the swords with a poison that seals your throat as soon as it touches blood.

363
00:29:28,539 --> 00:29:32,579
He'll be a sitting duck and I surely will succeed; I shall give you the goods at Ruyu House tomorrow.

364
00:29:32,579 --> 00:29:36,440
Even if I can't bring him to you alive, I'll still bring you his body.

365
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:40,218
Half the price will suffice! This is the end game of my dignity.

366
00:29:40,218 --> 00:29:42,359
Either him or me!

367
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:44,039
Nonsense!

368
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:47,799
I asked for him, his dead body has no use.

369
00:29:52,899 --> 00:29:56,359
If I go, it will just alert him.

370
00:29:56,359 --> 00:29:58,800
If this man really is an expert of Mountain and Sea Gang,

371
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,860
Mo Lin might not be able to kill him.

372
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:06,390
But he is patiently going around in circles with Mo Lin.

373
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:08,780
Is there anything else he wants?

374
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,199
[I know who you really are. If you don't want to be exposed, meet me at Wind Taker Institute's pavilion today afternoon.]

375
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,879
Since we know he's up to no good, why don't you expose him?

376
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,480
Why are you allowing him to stay in our Wind Takers Institute?

377
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,640
It's fun to have him around.

378
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,660
I don't have the heart to expose him and I'm going to meet him now.

379
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:28,799
Brother, even if he's not a man from Mountain and Sea Gang, he can't be a good person.

380
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,880
Who else can he be?

381
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:38,139
I found this on the night I trapped him in the quicksand.

382
00:30:38,139 --> 00:30:43,380
I haven't found Miss Qin yet but she already found me.

383
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:46,340
I think she is scheduled to meet with Mo Lin at Ruyu House.

384
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:49,719
Why is Miss Qin so determined to find you?

385
00:30:49,719 --> 00:30:54,919
No idea! Perhaps, that night I impressed her with my outstanding elegance.

386
00:30:56,279 --> 00:30:58,559
Either way, I just don't think it's safe.

387
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:01,680
What if she plotted against you with Mountain and Sea Gang?

388
00:31:02,239 --> 00:31:04,880
The Qin family has always been the Generals of the Emperors.

389
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,680
Mountain and Sea Gang and they can never be related.

390
00:31:08,939 --> 00:31:10,950
To find Wen Gecheng,

391
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:14,430
the easiest way is through the Qin Family.

392
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:18,000
So... You shouldn't keep going against her.

393
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,519
Why don't you just go sweet-talk her out and ask her to take you to Wen Gecheng?

394
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:27,300
With the mark of Mountain and Sea Gang, if I tell them our background,

395
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,299
how many will believe me?

396
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:35,819
And there's also a Zhao Xifan! He's guarding the gates all the time.

397
00:31:35,819 --> 00:31:37,760
Then what should we do?

398
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:42,539
- So this guy, Mo Lin, is extremely useful.
- How so?

399
00:31:42,539 --> 00:31:47,500
Can we make use of the treasures we found before?

400
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,719
It has been so long... Why hasn't he shown up?

401
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:12,160
What if he's too much of a coward?

402
00:32:27,699 --> 00:32:29,919
That's weird!

403
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:33,920
He is not Lu Ping.

404
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:53,718
[I know who you are. If you don't want to be exposed,]

405
00:32:53,718 --> 00:32:55,939
[meet me at Wind Takers Institute's pavilion today afternoon.]

406
00:33:08,959 --> 00:33:10,920
It's you?

407
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:22,218
Who are you? Say it! Why would you know who I am?

408
00:33:22,218 --> 00:33:24,998
It hurts! Misunderstanding! It's all a misunderstanding.

409
00:33:24,998 --> 00:33:27,459
How could I know who you are?

410
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,718
- Say it!
- I'll say it.

411
00:33:32,718 --> 00:33:34,559
I'll say it!

412
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:40,979
Who did this? Why is this happening?

413
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:50,880
This is the pavilion of the back hillside.

414
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,999
The reason why Mo Lin chose this spot, is probably because he'd use the terrain there.

415
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:59,799
He doesn't possess the Pneuma of Strength; thus, he will not fight me head-on.

416
00:33:59,799 --> 00:34:03,619
If I were him, I would set traps in the pavilion.

417
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,298
With such a generous gift of his, I surely have to give him something in return.

418
00:34:09,298 --> 00:34:13,960
And get rid of Zhao Xifan along the way.

419
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,678
Let's go, Brother! It'll be too late if we don't go to Ruyu House now.

Su Tang, you stay!

421
00:34:19,338 --> 00:34:21,220
This is a matter of the imperial court and the officials.

422
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:24,630
It's too dangerous! You shouldn't be involved.

423
00:34:24,638 --> 00:34:26,769
I'll come back for you once I discover the whereabouts of Wen Gecheng.

424
00:34:26,769 --> 00:34:28,560
- Brother!
- Don't worry!

425
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,100
I'll remember to buy some osmanthus candy for you.

426
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,359
You're not the God of Bandits, who on earth are you?

427
00:34:44,359 --> 00:34:48,479
I'm not God of Bandits but I'm an assassin.

428
00:34:49,319 --> 00:34:52,088
Quit acting! You don't possess the Pneuma of Strength.

Yet your bag is full of murderous mechanism.

Don't! You can take me anywhere; just don't take me to the officials.

No assassin goes to jail.

Assassin? Who is your target exactly?

00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,718
Forget it! I just want to survive.

436
00:35:16,718 --> 00:35:19,069
I shouldn't have to sacrifice for this.

437
00:35:21,329 --> 00:35:23,480

00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,410
His Majesty even gave your family three golden tokens.

470
00:38:35,419 --> 00:38:37,679
You can do anything with it.

471
00:38:39,629 --> 00:38:44,179
Of course, only you, Miss Qin, can possess such a token.

472
00:38:45,439 --> 00:38:49,329
Your guy is good! The powder works like magic.

473
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,709
What a shame!

474
00:38:52,759 --> 00:38:54,740
You killed Mo Lin?

475
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,660
Mo Lin was going to kill me with it.

476
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:08,859
I heard one drop can kill the entire Wind Taker Institute.

477
00:39:10,499 --> 00:39:14,139
Tell me! And the antidote is yours.

478
00:39:14,139 --> 00:39:16,800
What do you want to know?

479
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,529
Tell me where Wen Gecheng lives.

480
00:39:21,909 --> 00:39:26,698
- Is Mountain and Sea Gang going for Sir Wei as well?
- So you do know him.

481
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:30,400
Where can I find him?

482
00:39:32,429 --> 00:39:34,739
I'd never make deals with the Mountain and Sea Gang.

483
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:38,179
I'd rather die than embarrass my family.

484
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:58,329
Leader, do you think our prey is here yet?

485
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:01,240
We'll find out upstairs.

486
00:40:02,019 --> 00:40:07,169
If I say I'm not from Mountain and Sea Gang and that I just need your help,

487
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,440
do you believe it?

488
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,389
Then why are you torturing me?

489
00:40:12,389 --> 00:40:14,920
Didn't you try to kill me, too?

490
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:19,240
Besides, torture is the only way I know.

491
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:22,959
Hand me the antidote first to show your sincerity.

492
00:40:26,499 --> 00:40:29,390
You hit me! Don't go!

493
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:31,280
You hit me!

494
00:40:45,899 --> 00:40:48,819
This is bad! What is Xing Luo doing here?

495
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:53,219
Not good! My Pneuma of Strength can't be used now.

496
00:40:53,219 --> 00:40:55,859
I can't handle them! I have to leave.

497
00:40:56,980 --> 00:41:00,218
If I leave now, she will die for sure.

498
00:41:02,219 --> 00:41:04,409
I'm taking you with me, they're here.

499
00:41:04,409 --> 00:41:06,980
It's Xing Luo, an assassin of Mountain and Sea Gang.

500
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,470
You don't need to play nice, I'm poisoned anyways.

501
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:12,370
I can fight until the end with them.

502
00:41:12,378 --> 00:41:16,239
I gave you the water I used to wash my face, you would have diarrhea, but there's no need for an antidote.

503
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:47,668
Su Tang? Let's go!

504
00:42:09,219 --> 00:42:12,480
You... Are you two with those bandits?

505
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,679
A man and a woman threatened me to hide them.

506
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:20,078
They looked like bandits to me, I wouldn't budge, so they left.

507
00:42:20,078 --> 00:42:22,740
How much money do you want? I'll give it all to you.

508
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,880
Please don't hurt me.

509
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:30,840
Little sister, if you dare lie to us,

510
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,189
you'll lose your life.

511
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,600
[Ending OST: "The Paper Boat"]
[by Zhiqian Xue — Singers: Zhiqian Xue and Kewei Yu]

512
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:44,680
♫ Waiting to be buried by the lake in the town, ♫

513
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:50,700
♫ the White Paper Boat drifting with sorrow. ♫

514
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:56,510
♫ Lights on the other side of the sea ♫

515
00:43:56,510 --> 00:44:04,900
♫ punched fingertips in the red water tower. ♫

516
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:14,610
♫ Watch the little boat churning, laughing at the ordinariness. ♫

517
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:18,900
♫ Like a kite being pulled into a low altitude, ♫

518
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:24,340
♫ I smiled to the leaving person. ♫

519
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:28,600
♫ The more spotlight, the more vivid the story. ♫

520
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:33,650
♫ Laughing like the moon, ♫

521
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:38,140
♫ regretting the lighthouse broke in the waves, ♫

522
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:45,400
♫ I call the Milky Way that isolates us all, blue. ♫

523
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:52,850
♫ Like a moat built under the sea, ♫

524
00:44:52,850 --> 00:44:57,600
♫ waiting for the words on the paper boat to disappear, ♫

525
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:05,040
♫ there must always be someone who doesn’t remember listening to the other. ♫

526
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:12,300
♫ Anyone who is correctly guessed will end in disfavor. ♫

527
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:16,500
♫ You are particularly touched but others consider it ordinary. ♫

528
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:21,680
♫ Like the author, roughly put down with a weak stroke, ♫

529
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:26,200
♫ the writing boat on the lake was just like a paper crane in the air. ♫

530
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:31,010
♫ Laughing like the moon, ♫

531
00:45:31,010 --> 00:45:35,760
♫ regretting the lighthouse broke in the waves, ♫

532
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:43,700
♫ I call the Milky Way that isolates us all, blue. ♫

533
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:50,710
♫ Can a moat be built on the seabed? ♫

534
00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:55,100
♫ Wipe all the words on the paper boat! ♫

535
00:45:55,100 --> 00:46:02,530
♫ Please let someone not remember and don't tell another! ♫

536
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:09,490
♫ Hide the reluctance between words ♫

537
00:46:09,490 --> 00:46:14,100
♫ Unfortunately, I (you) are an average author ♫

538
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:21,750
♫ No matter how you (I) describe the rest, it's unnecessary! ♫

539
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:32,580
♫ Don't describe my unfulfilled promise! ♫

540
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:41,500
♫ Don't interpret my hidden fire-smoke! ♫

541
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:50,380
♫ Don't let the paper boat in the rough wave chasing me! ♫

542
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:59,600
♫ Don't wait until it over to know there are you and me! ♫
