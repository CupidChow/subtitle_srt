00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,940
♫ The dark green sea is hazy ♫

3
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:32,800
♫ dissipating in a flash ♫

4
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,600
♫ Rivers and lakes divide the world ♫

5
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,000
♫ Ten thousands arrows are firing at once ♫

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
♫ Who has time to worry? Who loves the color of blood? ♫

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,800
♫ At that time, spirits are high ♫

8
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,600
♫ Who calls the world his home?
Who dares let his horse freely run? ♫

9
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,320
♫ Silently, tears form in the death of night ♫

10
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,200
♫ Heroes are cutting all ties, ♫

11
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,020
♫ giving up whether it's life or death, ♫

12
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,290
♫ never asking what the cost is ♫

13
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:09,900
♫ Good and evil must be distinguished ♫

14
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,730
♫ The wind blows off the snow ♫

15
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:17,600
♫ On the body, etch multiple scars, ♫

16
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,750
♫ wandering all over the world, ♫

17
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:25,300
♫ only wish to ask for answers from this world ♫

18
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:29,250
♫ A teenager doesn't have to be a hero. ♫

19
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,100
♫ There is no need for flowers in the dream ♫

20
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,100
♫ Destiny need not be afraid ♫

21
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:40,730
♫ Because you have him all the way, ♫

22
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:44,700
♫ experienced a handful of conquests, ♫

23
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,560
♫ overcame a number of challenges ♫

24
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,750
♫ From now on, happy and free! ♫

25
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:56,380

[Episode 34]

29
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:26,609
Qin Sang. Qin Sang!

30
00:02:26,609 --> 00:02:28,500
You are not qualified to mention her name.

31
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,879
If she really didn't care about me, she wouldn't have cursed me at the same time while asking you to protect me.

32
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,260
All she thinks about is you.

33
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,199
But what have you done for her?

34
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,399
If it weren't for you, General Qin wouldn't have died in E'Zhou.

35
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,879
Had it not been for you, Miss Qin wouldn't have put herself in danger.

36
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,840
If I had known I should have had you killed back in Kaifeng.

37
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,320
You deserve to die for what you have done.

38
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,660
Why don't you kill me?

39
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:15,499
We only kill enemies.

40
00:03:15,499 --> 00:03:17,680
We will never kill innocent people.

41
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:23,520
I will not let your blood ruin our reputation.

42
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,720
You really are a soldier who's followed Qin Qi.

43
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:33,500
Tell me. What task did she give you?

44
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:39,400
She ordered me to escort you to the Big Dipper at night and stop you from coming back.

45
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,140
She's putting you to work.
(T/N: Lit: Putting fine timber to petty use.)

46
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,340
You know you are petty.

47
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:49,180
We should have stayed with the princess to fight against the Mountain and Sea Gang.

48
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,740
- But now...
- What did you say?

49
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:54,440
Qin Sang is planning to frame the Gang?

50
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,879
Yes. If it were to try and eliminate the Gang,

51
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:01,959
why would she have agreed to be a princess or to marry Yan Xifan?!

52
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:05,860
Wen Rui, you are worried about Qin Sang.

53
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,940
What about letting me go and we can go together to find and help her.

54
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:13,660
No. I must obey a military order.

55
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:16,599
Otherwise, I can't fulfill my responsibility to her.

56
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,659
You're not thinking. Pushing me away proves the danger she's in is big.

57
00:04:21,659 --> 00:04:25,399
If we don't go help and something happens,

58
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,660
you won't even get the chance to see her again.

59
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,900
Wen Rui, I beg you.

60
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,520
How can we let a girl go fight against the enemy

61
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,880
while we hide in the back?

62
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,180
Hurry up.

63
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,860
Fire the arrows!

64
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,200
Lu Ping.

65
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,260
Stop!

66
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,000
Princess.

67
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,799
What is it?

68
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,619
Yan Qiuci left the manor at dusk. He just got back.

69
00:06:00,619 --> 00:06:04,479
We saw Ling Ziyan in the manor, but she was packing up.

70
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,220
She seems like she's about to leave.

71
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,120
You're dismissed.

72
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:13,400
Turns out Ziyan has been in Wuji Manor this whole time.

73
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:28,680
I'm going to make take this gamble, bet on his love for me.

74
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,320
Ziyan.

75
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,220
Miss.

76
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,580
I will wait for you at midnight outside the manor.

77
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:58,260
I will be with you wherever you go.

78
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:02,690
[I'll wait for you at midnight...]

79
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:09,500
Ziyan, can you stay?

80
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,720
What for?

81
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,920
Why can't you just let me go? Whether it's Lu Ping or Xifan,

82
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:20,460
why can you always take what's important to me so easily?

83
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,500
Why do you always have to stand in front of me?

84
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,860
If it's because of Xifan, then you definitely shouldn't leave.

85
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,440
I never thought that the two of you loved each other.

86
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,820
Even more so, I would never have thought that I'd see you here.

87
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:39,940
I have to obey the marriage offered by His Majesty.

88
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:44,819
But the main order is to kill Liu Song and destroy the seal in the Thousand Pine Ruler.

89
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,480
So what?

90
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:53,400
Ziyan, the Qin family hasn't done right by you.

91
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:58,300
But I hope you can think of the country. Please hold back.

92
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,180
If we succeed,

93
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:05,000
I will speak up for you and Xifan.

94
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,280
What about your own reputation?

95
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:14,960
It is the Xining Princess who will be married. No one knows if that's me or not.

96
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,060
You can be her.

97
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:21,980
You are so upright, I can hardly compare to you.

98
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:25,720
Ziyan. Princess, you're here too.

99
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,230
Go on. He hopes to give you an answer as well.

[Wuji Manor]

Young Master.

102
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:28,780
Before Lu Ping left, he asked me to be braver

103
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,860
and to follow my heart.

104
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:34,720
But I have something I need to do.

105
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,279
I have to help my father in Wuji Manor. I have to cooperate with others against the Mountain and Sea Gang.

106
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,900
Lu Ping is an enemy of the gang.

107
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:45,420
He needs someone to help him in this battle.

108
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:50,220
So you want to go, but you also have to stay.

109
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:54,720
I promise you. After we've taken care of the Mountain and Sea Gang,

110
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,100
I will marry you.

111
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,679
You haven't asked me what I feel? You are so impulsive.

112

I… Ziyan,

113
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,400
I was too impulsive.

114
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,140
If you won't go, I won't go either.

115
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,860
I know you're ambitious when it comes to your goals.

116

I know that Miss wouldn't make it hard for you.

I won't be someone that runs away.

118
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:33,319
I will fight together with you, with all my strength.

119

I will be with you with dignity and pride. That's how I want to live.

And about the other things...

121
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:48,040
I will take care of the other things.

122

- What happened exactly?

161
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:35,440
♫ Every teardrop is a star ♫

162
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,940
It is just the glory of the Qin Family.

163
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,620
I can struggle through it with you.

164
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,380
Lu Ping...

165
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,920
are you alive or dead?

166
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,060
Where are you?

167
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:27,060
You didn't sleep at all last night, why don't you get some rest?

168
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,500
Miss is using everything in her power to search for Lu Ping right now.

169
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:33,439
The Agile Dragon Army isn't familiar with this area. I can serve as a guide.

170
00:15:33,439 --> 00:15:35,620
Also, I am responsible too.

171
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:40,160
If we had gone together, then he wouldn't have gone missing.

172
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,340
I just don't understand. How did the Mountain and Sea Gang sneak in

173
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:46,920
despite the defenses of the manor?

174
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:50,140
Also, aren't they trying to find a way right now to break the Thousand Pine Ruler?

175
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:53,000
Why did they try to grab Lu Ping?

176
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,100
It is indeed very strange.

177
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,700
Ziyan, please check the forest nearby.

178
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:03,379
I will search the lake where he disappeared. Maybe there will be clues.

179
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:27,140
[Wuji]

180
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,620
Princess.

181
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,460
Master Yan, it has been a night since the

182
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:34,080
Agile Dragon Army was attacked and Lu Ping disappeared.

183
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,240
Shouldn't we do something?

184
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,520
I have checked. There is an auspicious day seven days from now.

185
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,640
We will hold the wedding on that day.

186
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:47,639
Master Yan, I am not talking about the wedding but about the Mountain and Sea Gang.

187
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,860
The marriage was decided personally by His Majesty.

188
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,420
All the invitations have been sent.

189
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,560
How can we not go through with it?

190
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,400
Are you trying to checkmate me?

191
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,420
I dare not.

192
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:15,920
The wedding is supposed to be fake.

193
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,620
Please hand over Lu Chenfeng soon.

194
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,640
- His Majesty ordered that…
- Princess,

195
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,440
this is the Wuji Manor, not Kaifeng.

196
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:27,520
I understand better what needs to be done.

197
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,460
Ah Ze,

198
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:33,240
escort the princess back. Prepare for the wedding.

199
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,660
Yes.

200
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,759
Princess, please.

201
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,540
There's something not right with Wuji Manor.

202
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:01,180
We'd better be careful just in case.

203
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:04,080
You still haven't made an agreement with Master Yan?

204
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,820
They have defended the manor well.

205
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:10,419
We can't send any messages out nor organize our men.

206
00:18:10,419 --> 00:18:13,000
Doesn't it feel like we've been imprisoned?

207
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,420
You mean…

208
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:18,320
Yan Qiuci delayed the wedding;

209
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,500
and then secondly, delayed the attack towards the Mountain and Sea Gang.

210
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,460
Then he wouldn't let me meet see Lu Chenfeng.

211
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,500
Why?

212
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,479
Princess, I found something by the lake which I have to report.

213
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,700
Please take a look.

214
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,160
- An eagle feather of iron?
- Yes.

215
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,700
I learned from the general and put my Pneuma of Strength into my arrows.

216
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,840
It makes them extremely fast.

217
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:54,040
This is the arrow I shot when I was attacked that day.

218
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:58,659
The one who broke it must be learning the Pneuma of Vision.

219
00:18:58,659 --> 00:19:00,620
He may be more powerful than you.

220
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:03,000
I have fought with the Mountain and Sea Gang several times.

221
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,640
They use a strange silver hook weapon.

222
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,460
But yesterday, those people used swords.

223
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:14,919
Do you mean they are from Wuji Manor?

224
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,520
Impossible!

225
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,820
Your own home and you still eavesdrop?

226
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,760
Qin Sang.

227
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,140
You persuaded Ziyan to stay.

228
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:35,079
You took Lu Ping and now he's missing.

229
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:37,620
Now you suspect my father.

230
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:40,000
Is this how you cooperate with people?

231
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,900
What exactly are you trying to do?

232
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:45,640
We don't fight with our companions. We only prove things through evidence.

233
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:50,480
Don't you want to quickly finish this and then be with Ziyan?

234
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,640
We've been at the manor for two days and your father has been delaying everything this whole time.

235
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,220
Lu Ping is missing, yet he still delays.

236
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,240
Haven't you thought about why?

237
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,020
Since the first year of Shuo,

238
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:05,180
my father has protected the border of Jin.

239
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:09,660
This is important. He has to think more thoroughly and farther than you and I.

240
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:14,799
Younger Master, do you know that your father hid an important person

241
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,020
from me this entire time? Refusing to hand him over?

242
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:19,180
Do you know what your father is doing?

243
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,360
He tells you nothing.

244
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,620
Do you know why?

245
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,480
Important person?

246
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,960
What important person?

247
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,460
The Seven of the Big Dipper, including your father,

248
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:35,300
are famous for their powers, except for one.

249
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:41,540
Do you mean the previous Master of Tianquan Peak, Lu Chenfeng?

250
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,300
Yes. Lu Chenfeng.

251
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,640
I know that he isn't good at martial arts,

252
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,160
but at forging machines and weapons.

253
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:55,320
But after the Event of Seven Stars, he's been traveling around Jianghu.

254
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,800
Right now... no one knows where he is.

255
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,380
He is right here in Wuji Manor.

256
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,480
I'm guessing your father didn't tell you.

257
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,219
Liu Song got the Thousand Pine Ruler,

258
00:21:05,219 --> 00:21:08,880
but he can't break the lock and take the seal.

259
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,120
The aim of His Majesty is to get Liu Song using Lu Chenfeng as a bait.

260
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,760
Then we can destroy Liu Song and the seal.

261
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,720
I have been away from home for several years.

262
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,340
I am not familiar with things here.

263
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:25,820
It makes sense that Father wouldn't tell me such important information.

264
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:30,120
Qin Sang, we are friends who went through the Pneuma Combat Convention together.

265
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,199
Especially in times like these, we should be trusting our own people.

266
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,519
We can't be suspecting each other before we've even defeated the Mountain and Sea Gang.

267
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,380
Given that you believe your father this much.

268
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:42,240
And I don't mean to force you to suspect anything.

269
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,339
Please decide for yourself. We don't need to continue this conversation.

270
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,580
Princess, Mr. Yan is from Wuji Manor.

271
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,300
We can't believe in him completely.

272
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:05,259
How could you tell him such secrets?

273
00:22:05,259 --> 00:22:08,639
Xifan is a good example of filial piety but he is not stupid.

274
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,380
I made him angry on purpose,

275
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:13,340
because I hope he can investigate it and figure out what's happening.

276
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,940
Perhaps I hope for too much.

277
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:19,860
What should we do then? Just wait?

278
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:23,099
You go on first. I want to be alone.

279
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,700
Yes.

280
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,500
Lu Ping, where are you?

281
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,880
Elder, where am I?

282
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:08,380
Why is there a prison under the lake?

283
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:05,179
Did you already know the direction of the tide and that it's impossible to swim out?

284
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:12,920
I am speaking to you. Hey! I am speaking to you. Can you hear me?

285
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:23,639
What are you doing? Are you insane?

286
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:34,600
All your hair is white. I'll call you Old White.

287
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:45,300
Old White, how long have you been here?

288
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,260
One year?

289
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:49,700
Three years?

290
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:57,420
Draw the line. I have to draw the line.

291
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,560
If each line is one day,

292
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,220
you have really been here for a long time.

293
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:11,979
Let me out. Let me out! Who are you?

294
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,619
You are still eating. Are you happy here?

295
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I'm hungry. I am eating.

296
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,040
What are you doing?

297
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,240
This is my precious. Don't break it.

298
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,600
You have the Pneuma of Energy.

299
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:24,440
The… The Linked Camp Horn has been updated.

300
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:28,119
You recognize it? The Linked Camp Horn.

301
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:29,560
Eldest Brother.

302
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,580
Eldest Brother.

303
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:37,780
Eldest Brother, I am much younger than you.

304
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,780
Would you like to be my younger brother?

305
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,680
It's you, right? You're still alive.

306
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:15,320
You're here aren't you?! Lu Ping!

307
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:25,880
It's her. She is nearby.

308
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:28,780
Old White, well done.

309
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:35,119
Lu Ping, you are right here.

310
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:38,579
Wait for me. I will ask for help from Wuji Manor.

311
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:07,720
Princess, don't blame me for being cruel.

312
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:11,300
You're too clever for your own good.

313
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,020
Is there any news?

314
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:33,999
I have searched all the locations nearby, aside from where the Agile Dragon Army and Master Yan searched.

315
00:31:33,999 --> 00:31:36,060
There's no sign of Lu Ping.

316
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,200
There's something I need to ask Father about in person.

317
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,200
Fath-

318
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:00,440
Let's go see.

319
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,860
Is the news reliable?

00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:19,999
Yes. They disguised themselves as if they were on business and are marching towards Wuji Manor.

321
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:25,979
I have already arranged it. We set off tomorrow.

322
00:32:25,979 --> 00:32:30,200
Tell others that I am preparing for the wedding as a cover.

323
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:35,560
Remember, don't let anyone discover the truth.

324
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,740
What about Young Master?

325
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:45,240
I said, "anyone."

00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,540
Yes.

What do you think?

328
00:32:56,680 --> 00:33:01,219
Qin Sang was right. The Mountain and Sea Gang may have highly skilled people.

329
00:33:01,219 --> 00:33:06,180
But only Father can make such arrangements

330

What exactly is he hiding?

332
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:18,080
I don't know. But I would rather believe that he has his own plan.

333
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,860
And I only hope Lu Ping

334
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,200
wasn't caught by the Gang.

335
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:46,600
Master, Younger Master has gone.

336
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,160
He is still young.

337
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:56,760
Princess Xining must have told him something,

338
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,100
to make him suspect something.

339
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:04,220
Never mind. I will make sure none of this can be linked to him in the eyes of others.

340
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:10,180
When he later inherits Wuji Manor, he will understand why I did what I did.

341
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:15,080
I imprisoned Qin Sang in the water prison temporarily.

342
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,680
Isn't that dangerous?

343
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,600
The prison is hard to break.

344
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:23,640
Old Lu has been insane for years.

345
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,020
Just let them stay there for a bit.

346
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:30,160
Since she and Lu Ping love each other,

347
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:35,050
let's leave the miserable couple there to suffer a bit.

I'm sorry. I do this to save you.

351
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,620
Qin Sang. Good. You're finally awake.

That's good. That's good.

How dare you?

354
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,940
Did you come to save me? Is it because you missed me?

355
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,600
Impossible.

356
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,520
Then, why are your ears red?

357
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,940
And you still have this.

358
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:30,460
When will you stop that bad habit of stealing from others?

359
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:33,740
Looks like your old habit of lying to yourself hasn't changed either.

360
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,939
This is a life and death matter. Stop joking.

Where are we?

362

Under the lake.

363
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:46,860
How is there such a place under the lake? How did you get in here?

364
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:50,700
I had nowhere to go but to jump into the lake.

365
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:54,760
I thought I could swim out, but I almost drowned.

366

Can't you fight back?

367
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:02,600
The drugs you gave me can poison a horse to death. For me to make it out alive was a feat in and of itself.

368
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,160
You deserved it.

369
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:10,180
If it weren't for that, I wouldn't have known that you sent Wen Rui to protect me.

370
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:14,579
I don't want to see you again! I don't want you to bother me anymore!

371

Yet you're still here now?

372

Plus, if you happened to get here first, you probably would've been scared to death.

You…

Did you recognize the person who attacked you?

375
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:33,620
He was wearing the Mountain and Sea Gang's uniform but he didn't seem like one of them.

376
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,820
Why do you ask?

377
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,160
Because I was also attacked from behind and ended up in the water.

378
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:05,239
Master, it's confirmed. It's them.

Yes.

Father, when did you know about the Thousand Pine Ruler?

390
00:38:20,059 --> 00:38:22,180
Why did you hide it from me?

391
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,140
So everything Qin Sang said was true.

392
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:44,900
She told you everything about the secret orders from His Majesty.

393
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,940
Is Lu Chenfeng in Wuji Manor?

394

Yes.

395
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:57,940
That year, Eldest Brother and Sister-in-Law died in the Event of Seven Stars.

396
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:03,040
Chenfeng was ordered by Eldest Brother to seal Liu Song's commander's seal

397
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,860
in the Thousand Pine Ruler.

398
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:10,220
But he lost his mind and also suffered from shock that day.

399
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:15,500
I was worried it wouldn't be safe for him out there so I've always kept him here.

400
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:20,580
Do you blame me?

401
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:25,140
I am just confused. Why wouldn't you cooperate with the Agile Dragon Army?

402
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:27,600
And why didn't you tell me?

403
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,860
Chenfeng is my junior.

404
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:38,440
If the plan failed, how can I face Older Brother and Sister-in-Law?

405
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:41,580
Moreover, you are good friends with Qin Sang and Lu Ping.

Unfortunately, he's insane. He's been here for over ten years and remembers nothing.

423

It's all thanks to Old White forging iron here.

424
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:52,000
He used his Pneuma of Energy to change the direction of the water so that I could get in.

Don't bother. We can't get out.
