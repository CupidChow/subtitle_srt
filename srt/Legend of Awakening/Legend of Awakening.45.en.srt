00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,910
♫ The dark green sea is hazy ♫

3
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:32,800
♫ dissipating in a flash ♫

4
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,640
♫ Rivers and lakes divide the world ♫

5
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,000
♫ Ten thousands arrows are firing at once ♫

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,980
♫ Who has time to worry? Who loves the color of blood? ♫

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,800
♫ At that time, spirits are high ♫

8
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,600
♫ Who calls the world his home?
Who dares let his horse freely run? ♫

9
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,360
♫ Silently, tears form in the death of night ♫

10
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,230
♫ Heroes are cutting all ties, ♫

11
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,100
♫ giving up whether it's life or death, ♫

12
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,200
♫ never asking what the cost is ♫

13
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:09,900
♫ Good and evil must be distinguished ♫

14
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,730
♫ The wind blows off the snow ♫

15
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:17,650
♫ On the body, etch multiple scars, ♫

16
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:19,700
♫ wandering all over the world, ♫

17
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:25,300
♫ only wish to ask for answers from this world ♫

18
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:29,200
♫ A teenager doesn't have to be a hero ♫

19
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,090
♫ There is no need for flowers in the dream ♫

20
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,200
♫ Destiny need not be afraid ♫

21
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,810
♫ Because you have him all the way, ♫

[Legend of Awakening]

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,580
[Episode 45]

29
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,879
Everyone has their own fate.

30
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,581
If they can't deal with their own hardships,

31
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,241
what can others do?

32
00:02:45,241 --> 00:02:49,881
Unless Leng Xiutan were still alive; otherwise,

33
00:02:49,881 --> 00:02:52,841
Lu Ping can only wait for his death.

34
00:02:52,841 --> 00:02:54,281
Not necessarily.

35
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,859
Su Tang, why are you here?

36
00:02:57,859 --> 00:03:02,139
I escorted Master Chu Min to Big Dipper. I heard from Master that my brother and Qin Sang were here.

37
00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:05,041
Elder Guo, I have a way to save my brother.

38
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:11,620
[Big Dipper]

39
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,220
Sister Qin, I have a way to save my brother.

40
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,099
Su Tang, when did you get to Big Dipper?

41
00:03:24,099 --> 00:03:27,119
Yesterday. Master Chu Min has lost her memory.

42
00:03:27,119 --> 00:03:30,321
I came especially to entrust her to Master in Big Dipper.

43
00:03:30,321 --> 00:03:32,681
Lost her memory?

44
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:39,599
According to Master and Elder Guo, Master Chu Min's memory may be hard to recover in a short amount of time.

45
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,689
Fortunately, she still remembers that she had taught at Big Dipper.

46
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:47,549
Master asked her to continue teaching at Yaoguang Peak when she is better.

47
00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:50,981
Hopefully, it will help her recover her memory.

48
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,741
That's good. Lu Ping can feel at ease then, too.

49
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,960
Sister Qin.

50
00:04:00,461 --> 00:04:05,139
About the news of Master Chu Min, can you tell my brother after he's been healed?

51
00:04:05,139 --> 00:04:06,919
So he doesn't have to worry as much.

52
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,601
Lu Ping can be cured? How?

53
00:04:09,601 --> 00:04:14,939
I've already talked to Elder Guo about how to do it. If we find the Two Form Flower, my brother can be cured.

54
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:16,439
Two Form Flower?

55
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,299
The Two Form Flower can protect his meridians and make them bear the power of six pneumas.

56
00:04:20,299 --> 00:04:24,639
It was very hard but my father managed to plant one. My brother took it when he left the valley.

57
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,861
Do you know where it is?

58
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,880
Sister Qin, are you all right?

59
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,441
Su Tang.

60
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,961
Let's talk about the Two Form Flower later.

61
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:01,101
Lu Ping has already suffered a lot.

62
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,181
Let him live a few more days for himself.

63
00:05:05,181 --> 00:05:10,420
But you are the one who cares about him the most. Don't you want to save him?

64
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:13,541
It hasn't been easy for Lu Ping to gain a few days of peace.

65
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:19,001
If he regains the six pneumas, who can guarantee he won't get pulled into the chaos again?

66
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:26,741
I married Lu Ping last night. I don't want much.

67
00:05:26,741 --> 00:05:30,041
I just want to live a peaceful life for a few days.

68
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,081
I hope you can help me.

69
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:13,671
God, why do you always have to play tricks on people?

70
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:18,161
There's only one Two Form Flower.

71
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:22,041
In order to save me, Lu Ping made me take it.

72
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:28,511
Now I am afraid all I can do is use my blood, a life for a life.

73
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,841
Why?!

74
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:46,691
Why out of the two of us can only one survive?

75
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:51,441
Why can't you let us be selfish for once?

76
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:01,681
I really don't want to leave him.

77
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,621
I really don't want to leave him.

78
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:00,439
Bandit, you said you would cook. Have you been well behaved?

79
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:13,281
Lu Ping... Lu Ping!

80
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,239
You can choose one pneuma to practice. Then reach two.

81
00:08:29,239 --> 00:08:31,741
Until you can use several pneuma.

82
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,519
Your fists are not straight enough. How could you use pneumatic powers?

83
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:40,479
Keep your wrists relaxed and your knees straight. Try one more time.

84
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,001
Why are you here?

85
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:52,541
I've learned the pneumatic powers.

86
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,269
- You're so great!
- You're so great!

87
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,540
I want to join the army, too!

88
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,719
I have to serve my country.

89
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,079
One by one. Don't rush.

90
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:18,999
Why didn't you stay at home? What are you doing here?

91
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,721
Came out to relax. I can't stay at home all day.

92
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,261
How was Big Dipper?

93
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:32,721
Looking at these children,

94
00:09:32,721 --> 00:09:37,659
I think of the days when I lived and practiced with my seniors and juniors.

95
00:09:37,659 --> 00:09:39,781
I felt like I should go to see Big Dipper.

96
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,801
I can go with you right now. Good timing, as Su Tang just got back, too.

97
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,559
Su Tang. Sangsang came in the morning for a short time.

98
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:19,399
What did you say to her? Why did she ignore everyone and run off?

99
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:23,180
Has she seen the Two Form Flower? Can your brother survive?

100
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,141
Wei Tianqi, are you looking for a beating?

101
00:10:27,141 --> 00:10:30,481
Are you looking forward to my brother's recovery or death?

102
00:10:30,481 --> 00:10:35,519
I'm telling you. Even if my brother is gone today, there is no room for you.

103
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,521
Who says I am gone?

104
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,120
Brother!

105
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:49,661
I am sorry. I shouldn't have left you alone in Carefree Valley.

106
00:10:49,661 --> 00:10:52,459
It's good to see you back. As long as you're alive.

107
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:57,060
Sangsang, let's not disturb their sibling reunion.

108
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:07,681
I don't want to hear the name of Sangsang anymore.

109
00:11:07,681 --> 00:11:11,241
Today, you can call her sister-in-law.

110
00:11:11,241 --> 00:11:14,260
You. Shameless.

111
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,581
Master Chu Min.

112
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,341
You all can learn from Master Chu of Yaoguang Peak from now on.

113
00:11:27,341 --> 00:11:28,720
Yes.

114
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:33,841
New? Your foundations aren't even solid.

115
00:11:33,841 --> 00:11:37,781
First run 50 laps before entering Yaoguang Peak.

116
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,280
Master.

117
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,279
Brother, our Master—

118
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,841
Master Chu Min.

119
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,681
Don't call me "Master" if you aren't one of Yaoguang Peak.

120
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,721
When did Big Dipper have such weak disciples?

121
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,021
Senior, there's no harm in saying what you want to say.

122
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,681
You've always been very frank anyway.

123
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,201
Your internal breathing is disordered.

124
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,761
Before, you could have lived for more than a month.

125
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,221
But now…

126
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,481
How many days does he have left?

127
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,601
Three days, at most.

128
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:22,501
I used to hate the pneuma confinement.

129
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,481
But now that I don't have it,

130
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,601
I can't protect my own life.

131
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,861
This is probably retribution, isn't it?

132
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,891
What if there was another chance for you?

133
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,391
No one has a second chance.

134
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:58,061
Just say it. What would you do?

135
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,661
The times when I went down the wrong path,

136
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,841
I would do differently.

137
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,961
Unfortunately, there is no turning back when it comes to time.

138
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:23,981
I will try cooking the porridge again. I'll ask Su Tang to help this time.

139
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:55,581
Su Tang, I didn't tell you before.

140
00:14:55,581 --> 00:14:59,621
Now I've decided, I'm going to save your brother.

141
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,241
I need your help.

142
00:15:02,241 --> 00:15:06,121
Sister Qin, don't joke.

143
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:10,059
I found out about all of it. You'll die.

144
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:18,441
If the Two Form Flower was in your blood, would you give it to Lu Ping?

145
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,781
You and my brother just got married.

146
00:15:35,781 --> 00:15:40,761
If something happens to you, my brother would rather die.

147
00:15:40,761 --> 00:15:46,141
I know he will be very sad. So I want you to accompany him.

148
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,701
You're the one that's closest to him.

149
00:15:49,701 --> 00:15:54,341
For you, he'll continue to live his life well.

150
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,140
There are some things that

151
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,771
no matter how hard it is, you still have to do.

152
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,921
I want him to live well.

153
00:16:08,921 --> 00:16:12,041
Live according to his heart's wishes.

154
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:20,260
No. Qin Sang, are you insane?

155
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:23,839
You're going to die for Lu Ping? I don't agree. Come with me.

156
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,260
Tianqi.

157
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,100
What did you call me?

158
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:32,661
Tianqi, Shuo is also your hometown.

159

You have your brothers and friends here.

Now the war has begun. You don't want to lose them either. Do you?

161
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:48,059
As one person, I can't do anything about it. But Lu Ping can.

162
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,761

164

Don't come over here. No matter what, I won't agree to it.

165
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:11,841
Ever since you came to Big Dipper, you've changed a lot.

166
00:17:11,841 --> 00:17:14,721
You know we should focus on the bigger picture.

167
00:17:14,721 --> 00:17:18,951
I believe you will become a formidable and brave man in the future.

You will help me. Won't you?

00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:45,301
Sangsang, You know I won't turn you down.

171

You know that whatever you say, I'll say yes to.

How is everything?

173
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,739
The disciple guarding him has been transferred by me. I just gave Lu Ping silver needles.

174
00:18:20,739 --> 00:18:22,981
It'll be half a day before he wakes up.

No matter who comes, don't let them disturb us.

Take care of yourself. I'm entrusting Lu Ping to you.

My master taught me medical skills. Don't worry.

It won't hurt at all. It'll feel like you're asleep.

♫ when the mirror in the bottom of the pupil has been lifted out, ♫

316
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:55,900
♫ my affection is deciphered as a longing ♫

317
00:39:55,900 --> 00:40:01,800
♫ Who is reflected in my eyes? ♫

318
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:08,270
♫ It’s a lifetime of foreshadowing you ♫

319
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:17,910
♫ The candle wants to extinguish, the lamp wants to dim,
don’t want to say it’s the end ♫

320
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:24,900
♫ No matter if the sky is clear or not ♫

321
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:29,579
Master, Big Dipper has never been so bright. What's...?

322
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:35,741
Maybe someone's untied the knot in his heart. The stars have returned to their place.

323
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:42,861
The Awakener has finally truly awakened.

324
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:59,120
[Tomb of Qin Sang]

325
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:19,080
[Qin Sang]

326
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:24,011
I know you've always wanted to be free

327
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,111
and unfettered in Jianghu.

328
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:36,160
This place has the most beautiful scenery during the day and the brightest stars at night.

329
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:41,301
There are seniors and juniors practicing martial arts,

330
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:44,320
making it lively every day.

331
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:48,441
You'll definitely like it here.

332
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:57,021
After I've finished what I have to do,

333
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:04,321
I will come back to keep you company. Okay?

334
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:17,521
Big Dipper is not a place where anyone can just bury bones.

335
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,241
You've broken the rules again.

336
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:28,561
Since you're speaking of it now, does that mean you've acquiesced?

337
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:32,261
I can use the six pneumas now.

338
00:42:32,261 --> 00:42:35,761
Even if you disagree, you're no match for me.

339
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,151
After last night,

340
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:46,271
how does your body feel?

341
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,601
At the time, my entire body felt hot.

342
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:53,641
I thought I was going to die.

343
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:58,141
But after I woke up, I realized I was okay.

344
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:04,821
I know... she wouldn't let me die.

345
00:43:04,821 --> 00:43:07,221
Then, what plans do you have now?

346
00:43:07,221 --> 00:43:11,201
I have to do what I promised her.

347
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,881
No more pursuing hatred and resentment?

348
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:19,739
Didn't you want to drag my brother out of the grave and ask what happened?

349
00:43:19,739 --> 00:43:23,501
If I did that, Uncle, could you let me go?

350
00:43:23,501 --> 00:43:26,120
It depends on whether you understand him or not.

351
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:35,071
Now I really understand why Master kept hiding the truth from me.

352
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:42,990
He was afraid that I would be deceived by hatred... become another Liu Song.

353
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:51,310
I don't practice martial arts so that I can address the resentment or hatred in my family.

354
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,711
Then, who do you do it for?

355
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:10,750
[Ending OST: "The Paper Boat"]
[by Zhiqian Xue — Singers: Zhiqian Xue and Kewei Yu]

356
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:16,810
♫ Waiting to be buried by the lake in the town, ♫

357
00:44:16,810 --> 00:44:22,900
♫ the White Paper Boat drifting with sorrow ♫

358
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:28,700
♫ Lights on the other side of the sea ♫

359
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:36,970
♫ punched fingertips in the red water tower ♫

360
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:46,830
♫ Watch the little boat churning, laughing at the ordinariness ♫

361
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:51,100
♫ Like a kite being pulled into a low altitude, ♫

362
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:56,560
♫ I smiled to the leaving person ♫

363
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:00,900
♫ The more spotlight, the more vivid the story ♫

364
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:05,820
♫ Laughing like the moon, ♫

365
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:10,300
♫ regretting the lighthouse broke in the waves, ♫

366
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:17,980
♫ I call the Milky Way that isolates us all, blue ♫

367
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:25,050
♫ Like a moat built under the sea, ♫

368
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:29,800
♫ waiting for the words on the paper boat to disappear, ♫

369
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:37,610
♫ there must always be someone who doesn’t
remember listening to the other ♫

370
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:44,500
♫ Anyone who is correctly guessed will end in disfavor ♫

371
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:48,620
♫ You are particularly touched but others consider it ordinary ♫

372
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:54,100
♫ Like the author, roughly put down with a weak stroke, ♫

373
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:58,370
♫ the writing boat on the lake was just like
a paper crane in the air ♫

374
00:45:58,370 --> 00:46:03,300
♫ Laughing like the moon, ♫

375
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:07,950
♫ regretting the lighthouse broke in the waves, ♫

376
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:16,040
♫ I call the Milky Way that isolates us all, blue ♫

377
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:22,900
♫ Can a moat be built on the seabed? ♫

378
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:27,190
♫ Wipe all the words on the paper boat! ♫

379
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:35,030
♫ Please let someone not remember and don't tell another! ♫

380
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:41,780
♫ Hide the reluctance between words ♫

381
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:46,400
♫ Unfortunately, I (you) am (are) an average author ♫

382
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:54,430
♫ No matter how you (I) describe the rest, it's unnecessary! ♫

383
00:46:55,870 --> 00:47:04,800
♫ Don't describe my unfulfilled promise! ♫

384
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:13,600
♫ Don't interpret my hidden fire-smoke! ♫

385
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:22,500
♫ Don't let the paper boat in the rough wave chasing me! ♫

386
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:30,140
♫ Don't wait until it's over to know there are you and me! ♫
