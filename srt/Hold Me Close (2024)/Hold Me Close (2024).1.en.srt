1
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:50,837
I hope it lands here.

2
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:17,882
Hello.

3
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:35,984
One please.

4
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:30,163
Hello!

5
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:33,708
Would you like some fresh squid?

6
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,546
I still have other places to visit.

7
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,424
But I promise I will be back later to buy.

8
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,051
Promise.

9
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:46,345
<i>Sugoi!</i>

10
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:47,764
<i>Sugoi.</i>

11
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:48,765
<i>Sugoi!</i>

12
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:49,849
<i>Sugoi.</i>

13
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:55,855
I bet he's Filipino.

14
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:57,398
How did you know?

15
00:05:58,316 --> 00:05:59,942
He points at things with his lips.

16
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:01,652
<i>Ohayou!</i>

17
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,613
- <i>Ohayou!</i>
- Three, please.

18
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:05,740
Three, give her three.

19
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,208
This should be fine.

20
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:45,905
Closing now? I need seven squids, please.

21
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:50,618
A thousand yen.

22
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:54,747
Hey!

23
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,124
- Please leave.
- What, why?

24
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:57,166
Please, go home.

25
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,501
We're already closed.

26
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,671
Please leave.

27
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,256
You guys are crazy!

28
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,428
- Lynlyn! Are you okay?
- You okay?

29
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:14,600
How should I cook
these spare squid we have?

30
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,770
I'm good with just grilling it.

31
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:18,813
Again?

32
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:20,606
Let's try something new.

33
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,108
Ow, that hurt!

34
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:23,192
Hey, cut it out!

35
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:26,112
You should be thankful,
you get to eat every day.

36
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:28,781
What?

37
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:34,996
Isn't that the guy from earlier?

38
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,458
The one who said he'll come back to buy?

39
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,751
Bro, do you need help?

40
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,675
I thought you guys were Japanese.

41
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,052
Let's help him out.

42
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,024
It's okay, I'm fine.

43
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,217
Um…

44
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,511
I was supposed to come back to buy squid,

45
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,721
but it seems you guys closed up.

46
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,973
Yobuko morning market is only until noon.

47
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:38,226
There's a reason
it's called "morning market."

48
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,144
Fair enough.

49
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,439
Is he with you guys?

50
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:48,236
They're the rude bastards
who refused to sell me squid!

51
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,239
Who do you think you are?

52
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:56,953
Leave this man alone!
He didn't do anything!

53
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,454
- Huh?
- Let's go.

54
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:01,457
Leave her alone!

55
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,668
- Stop!
- Stop it!

56
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,002
Stop it, Botbot, Tantan!

57
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,212
That's enough!

58
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,839
- Please, stop!
- Lynlyn!

59
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,216
Please stop!

60
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,385
What?

61
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:15,346
Beer.

62
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,431
Beer!

63
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:19,433
Let's buy beer!

64
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,354
Beer!

65
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:25,648
Let's buy beer!

66
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:29,110
Let's meet at the bridge.
The bridge, okay?

67
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:30,611
We're going to buy beer!

68
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:33,489
Let's buy beer!

69
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:41,497
There he is!

70
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,795
They're gone!

71
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:50,923
They're finally gone!

72
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,928
Turns out, they're not from here.

73
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,847
They're from Kitakyushu.

74
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:00,308
Is that far from here?

75
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:02,143
It is.

76
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:05,688
Do these things often happen here
in Karatsu?

77
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:08,190
Not really. Honestly, it's peaceful here.

78
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:09,900
That's good.

79
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,569
I really don't like trouble.

80
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,864
I just moved here. Since…

81
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:24,707
Lynlyn! Lynlyn!

82
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:28,586
He rescued us
from those drunk guys earlier.

83
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:31,339
He baited them with free beer.

84
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:32,757
At least they left.

85
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,055
Thank you.

86
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:41,891
I'm Lynlyn, by the way.

87
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,392
These are my siblings.

88
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,727
Botbot. Tantan.

89
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,230
And I'm Woody.

90
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:51,901
Wait.

91
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,987
The drunk person earlier said
he was offended

92
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,907
while he was buying squid.

93
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,035
He's a bad person.

94
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:03,788
How come?

95
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:07,124
We know, we've been here for so long.

96
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,960
Botbot, give him some squid.

97
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,546
Wow.

98
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,631
Thank you.

99
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,261
Thank you!

100
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,808
Right. What about the things you bought?

101
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:25,142
Will you take them home?

102
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,020
No, you can have them.

103
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:32,525
I just bought those stuff
to experience the morning market.

104
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:41,826
If so, we'll go ahead.

105
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:43,077
Leaving so soon?

106
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:45,830
Let's go.

107
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,045
Excuse me.

108
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:01,887
This is a lot!

109
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:27,913
<i>Ohayou gozaimasu!</i>

110
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:31,917
Where are your siblings?

111
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:36,630
Tantan and Botbot are fishing for squid.

112
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:40,885
Your squid is really tasty!

113
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,012
Promise…

114
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:45,806
Let me buy more.

115
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:48,893
How many?

116
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:52,021
Ten.

117
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,481
You can finish all of that?

118
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,524
Of course.

119
00:12:55,608 --> 00:13:01,071
Three in the morning, four at lunchtime,
then three again in the evening.

120
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,386
How long have you been in Karatsu?

121
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,056
Less than a week.

122
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,309
There's still a lot you haven't seen here.

123
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:32,186
Yeah, I guess.

124
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:38,692
Maybe you can…

125
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:39,818
show me around?

126
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:45,199
What's in it for me?
I've seen everything here.

127
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:48,285
And I got things to do, can't you see?

128
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:51,789
What if I buy everything in one go?

129
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:54,917
Even this.

130
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:01,507
There's an observation deck nearby.

131
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,510
You can see the entire city
of Karatsu from there.

132
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,429
Sounds exciting.

133
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,401
Are you avoiding me?

134
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:23,904
I'm not.

135
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:46,468
I'm not avoiding you.

136
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:54,894
Let's go up there.

137
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,567
What's that river?

138
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:02,985
That's Matsuura river.

139
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:08,073
What about this stretch of land
filled with trees?

140
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,205
Niji-no-Matsubara.

141
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:22,588
It was built 400 years ago to block
the strong winds coming from the sea.

142
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,049
Wow!

143
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:26,091
Let's go!

144
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,760
There's nothing there.

145
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,678
- Just want to take a look--
- It's ugly!

146
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,310
Okay.

147
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:41,440
You know more about this place than I do.

148
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,152
As long as I can explore with you,

149
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:46,737
I'm happy.

150
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,620
You seem too happy.

151
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:57,373
Nothing, it's just…

152
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:02,294
I'm just happy that I met you,
and Tantan, and Botbot.

153
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,881
You've only known me for two days.

154
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,633
My siblings, for just a day.

155
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:09,218
Exactly!

156
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,387
But you've been so kind to me.

157
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,805
Right?

158
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:17,351
I haven't had luck when it comes to
places I chose to live.

159
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,812
Where did you live before?

160
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,272
Before Karatsu…

161
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,233
in Bangkok.

162
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,026
Before Bangkok, in Cebu.

163
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,236
Before Cebu, in L.A.

164
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,487
Before L.A., Jakarta.

165
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,030
Before Jakarta, Madrid.

166
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,949
Before Madrid, in Miami--

167
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:38,372
Why do you keep moving?
Are you trying to escape?

168
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,628
I just haven't found my "perfect home."

169
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:51,260
I hope Karatsu is the one.

170
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:34,636
Let's go.

171
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:38,724
What's wrong?

172
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:44,146
You act like you don't like me,
but you entertain my advances.

173
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:47,733
You randomly touch me, my hands,
on the cheeks.

174
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:50,611
Just tell me if you like me, or not.

175
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:53,197
We've only known each other for two days.

176
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,865
What kind of question is that?

177
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:03,874
Sorry.

178
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:06,627
- I just don't know--
- I have a special ability.

179
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:15,886
I can sense whether a person
will bring pain or joy into my life.

180
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:21,266
And can you sense if it's immediately,
or in the future?

181
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,144
That, I don't know.

182
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:25,479
It could be tomorrow.

183
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:26,980
Next year.

184
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,649
Even after 50 years.

185
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:33,612
That's why your siblings get tense
when there are other people around.

186
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,161
What do you sense from me?

187
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,042
Nothing.

188
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,919
Nothing, as in absolutely nothing?

189
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:52,172
No joy, no pain, no…

190
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,633
You won't have any significance
in my life.

191
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:55,843
Just neutral.

192
00:18:57,886 --> 00:18:59,596
That's a serious accusation.

193
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,724
What accusation?
At least you're not negative.

194
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,935
The only reason I keep you around,

195
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:07,146
is because you won't do anything wrong.

196
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:12,860
Let's try again.

197
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,778
- Did I consent?
- Sorry.

198
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:16,697
Sorry.

199
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,369
Shall we?

200
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:53,817
Nope.

201
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:55,402
Still nothing?

202
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:04,411
Maybe because we've just met recently.

203
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:09,249
But I promise,
once you get to know me better,

204
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:11,418
it will be positive.

205
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,051
Wait a sec.

206
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,428
I'll handle this.

207
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,810
- Why are you dressed that way?
- You guys relax.

208
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:30,395
I got this.

209
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,816
Squid. Squid!

210
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,569
- Hello.
- Hello.

211
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,363
- I'd like two, please.
- Okay.

212
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,413
<i>Ohayou gozaimasu!</i>

213
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:50,916
What are you doing?

214
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,543
Do you want something cleaned inside?

215
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:55,879
I'm good at cleaning.

216
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:18,777
I'll buy everything
so we can go out again.

217
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:24,658
Wait, are you doing all of this
just to be positive?

218
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:25,993
Not really.

219
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:28,453
Kind of.

220
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:29,788
No.

221
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:31,206
This is just how I am.

222
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:55,522
What?

223
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:58,442
Still nothing.

224
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:19,504
Why do you want me to like you?

225
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:27,929
You like me, right?

226
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:32,559
Yes.

227
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:38,190
I know you're not comfortable.

228
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:41,902
If you like me, why don't you kiss me?

229
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:45,906
Well, because I'm nothing to you, right?

230
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:50,786
I want you to have
a positive impression of me first.

231
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:53,955
So I'm asking you. What should I do,
so I can turn things around?

232
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,374
I'm okay. At least you're not negative.

233
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,381
I don't know…

234
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,384
it just doesn't feel right.

235
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,057
I shouldn't have come here.

236
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,311
Sorry for the trouble.

237
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:17,270
No.

238
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:10,657
Our sister's been acting weird lately.

239
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:13,493
It's obvious. She likes Woody.

240
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:17,539
How about you?
Do you like Woody as a person?

241
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:20,208
It's not important
whether I like Woody or not.

242
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,253
As long as she's got
no negative read on him.

243
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:25,755
Yes!

244
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:30,594
You went out?

245
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:34,222
- I thought you were asleep.
- I just went to buy some things.

246
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,016
We could've bought it for you.

247
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,393
It's okay, I don't want to bother you.

248
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:42,731
By the way, when we see Woody,
don't pay too much attention to him.

249
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:44,774
But why?

250
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:49,946
Why are we entertaining him so much?

251
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,531
He's not positive.

252
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,116
Well, yeah.

253
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,993
How about the other people

254
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:58,163
I don't have a read on,
do we pay attention to them?

255
00:24:58,246 --> 00:25:00,790
Do we give them special treatment?

256
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:02,250
We don't, right?

257
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:05,003
So why are we giving Woody
special treatment?

258
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:09,174
Because… he's your type.

259
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:12,510
Ouch! You said that!
You said it was obvious!

260
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,429
You said it!

261
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:18,308
Go to sleep, both of you,
early day tomorrow.

262
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,561
You said that.

263
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:29,986
I want to see
the Nanatsugama Caves. Let's go!

264
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:32,489
We can't go today.

265
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:35,951
I'll just buy all of this.

266
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,079
We've got regular customers.
It can't just be you.

267
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:43,917
- How about tomorrow?
- We can't.

268
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,877
- The day after tomorrow?
- We can't.

269
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,545
- Next week.
- We can't.

270
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:48,838
I'm available.

271
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:49,756
Ouch!

272
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:55,929
Okay, I'll just buy five squids.

273
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:19,953
Leave.

274
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,416
I said, leave.

275
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:45,812
Lynlyn?

276
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:49,607
Positive.

277
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:51,985
Who?

278
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:57,615
Him.

279
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:58,616
Oh, my!

280
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,623
Besides you two, he's the only one
I've read as positive.

281
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:09,919
What should I do?

282
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:15,633
Well, what do you want to do?

283
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,639
I… I don't know.

284
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:25,226
But I'm so happy.

285
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:28,229
What should I do in this situation?

286
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,482
Just celebrate!

287
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:32,484
<i>En-Ya!</i>

288
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:33,860

00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,153

<i>Well, you can just shoot me</i>

00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:01,865
<i>Ma, that's enough!</i>

304
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:05,744
<i>Why don't you just shoot me?</i>

305
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:07,579
<i>My life is a living hell!</i>

306
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:15,587
It's almost noon.

307
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,548
Let's just wait, he won't be long.

308
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:22,969
Maybe he still has leftover squid,
that's why he didn't come.

309
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,558
I remember you raised
your voice at him yesterday.

310
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:31,436
It's only natural for him to hesitate.

311
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:34,105
Why'd you make him leave
when you felt positive?

312
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,315
I don't know.

313
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:37,358
- Were you nervous?
- I don't know.

314
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:39,944
- Were you thrilled?
- Heck, I don't know!

315
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:46,159
You can have this.

316
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:49,370
- That's for Woody, right?
- He's not coming.

317
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:53,541
There!

318
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:55,835
There he is.

319
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,337
Hey! You guys had lunch?

320
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,505
Hey, just in time!

321
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,424
I've also got some for you.

322
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:06,471
Really?

323
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,865
Sorry for yelling at you yesterday.

324
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:29,202
I'm sorry too, I was annoying.

325
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:30,912
Not at all.

326
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:32,539
No, it's okay. Right, Botbot?

327
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:35,583
Yes, in fact, Lynlyn wants to go out
with you.

328
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:37,669
Are you not busy?

329
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:39,003
We are.

330
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:40,380
But Lynlyn isn't!

331
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:51,641
- Zeela, for two, please.
- <i>Hai.</i>

332
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:16,207
- Did you call me?
- What?

333
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,127
- You didn't touch me?
- No.

334
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:04,756
Really?

335
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:06,883
These things are 100 years old?

336
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:08,551
Yes.

337
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:12,722
Every November, they parade
them all on the street.

338
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:15,892
And the people
altogether shout repeatedly…

339
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:17,894
En-Ya!

340
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:19,145
En-Ya!

341
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:20,939
- En-Ya!
- En-Ya?

342
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:22,899
Yes, along with the drummers.

343
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:23,858
Like this…

344
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:25,902
<i>En-Ya</i>!

345
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:26,986
<i>En-Ya!</i>

346
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:28,988
<i>En-Ya!</i>

347
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:30,365
<i>- En-Ya!</i>
<i>- En-Ya!</i>

348
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:31,741
<i>- En-Ya!</i>
<i>- En-Ya!</i>

349
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:32,825
<i>- En-Ya!</i>
<i>- En-Ya!</i>

350
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:34,702
- <i>En-Ya!</i>
- <i>En-Ya!</i> There!

351
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:35,787
<i>- En-Ya!</i>
<i>- En-Ya!</i>

352
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,538
- <i>En-Ya!</i>
- <i>En-Ya! </i>That's it.

353
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:38,831
<i>En-Ya!</i>

354
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:39,791
<i>- En-Ya!</i>
<i>- En-Ya!</i>

355
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:41,709
<i>- En-Ya!</i>
<i>- En-Ya!</i>

356
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,252
<i>- En-Ya!</i>
<i>- En-Ya!</i>

357
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:44,712
<i>- En-Ya!</i>
<i>- En-Ya!</i>

358
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,130
<i>- En-Ya!</i>
<i>- En-Ya!</i>

359
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:47,340
<i>- En-Ya!</i>
<i>- En-Ya!</i>

360
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:48,341
<i>- En-Ya!</i>
<i>- En-Ya!</i>

361
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:54,889
I have a question about your ability.

362
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:56,766
What is it?

363
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:05,692
When you touch someone, you can sense
whether they're positive, negative…

364
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:07,568
or just neutral, right?

365
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:09,946
Yes.

366
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:11,447
Let's stay here for now.

367
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:14,784
That can change, right?

368
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:16,536
It can't be permanent.

369
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:23,793
I just can't accept
that I have no significance.

370
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:27,922
The truth is, I like you.

371
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:33,094
- I was just thinking--
- You're positive.

372
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:38,474
What?

373
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:42,228
Who would have thought?

374
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,481
Wow!

375
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:50,570
But…

376
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:54,782
what did you like about me first?

377
00:33:57,618 --> 00:33:59,746
I'm just a weird person.

378
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:03,624
I don't have an exciting career.

379
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:06,044
I got nothing interesting in life.

380
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:09,756
So… why?

381
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:15,678
Because you're kind to me.

382
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:18,681
Is that it?

383
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:23,144
Don't take that lightly.

384
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:27,106
Only few people are kind to me.

385
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:09,315
I'm going to get you!

386
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,819
When I get you, you'll see.

387
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:17,490
Why are we still here?

388
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:19,117
She's old enough, right?

389
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:21,494
I know.

390
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:24,163
Lynlyn!

391
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:26,874
- What?
- We'll leave you guys, okay?

392
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:28,835
Where are you going?

393
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:30,753
I don't know, walk around.

394
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:33,631
It's feels weird staying here,
watching you lovebirds.

395
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:36,384
Geez, we're just playing around!

396
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:40,138
- Why don't you join? It'll be fun!
- No thanks. Pass.

397
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:43,641
Remember, Woody,
if you feel any negativity,

398
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:45,476
protect our sister!

399
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,602
Sir, yes, sir!

400
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:48,437
Let's go.

401
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:51,607
Take care!

402
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:55,611
Can I touch you again?

403
00:35:57,488 --> 00:36:00,491
Go ahead, you got
an all-access pass to my body.

404
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:13,045
Stop teasing me. Come here.

405
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:21,596
Do you still want to know more about me?

406
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:27,643
How did you get that ability?

407
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:32,064
I was expecting your questions

408
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:34,025
to be about my work,

409
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:36,152
about my parents' province.

410
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:40,615
It's fine if you don't want
to talk about it.

411
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,120
Years ago…

412
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:50,291
I encountered a <i>yokai</i> in the forest.

413
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:52,460
Do you know what a <i>yokai</i> is?

414
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:57,089
They are Japanese spirits and creatures.

415
00:36:57,798 --> 00:37:01,844
I think they're the ones
who gave me this ability.

416
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:05,306
Forest?

417
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:07,391
What were you doing in the forest?

418
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:10,895
Nothing.

419
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:12,855
Just strolling around.

420
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:18,444
And then you encountered the <i>yokai</i>,
and you gained the ability?

421
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:22,323
How about you?

422
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:26,661
How did your search
for the perfect home start?

423
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:31,290
Isn't everyone looking for a perfect home?

424
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:34,293
Yes, but you're kind of crazy with it…

425
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:35,753
Searching the whole world.

426
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:40,383
But if you have the means,
why not, I guess.

427
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:45,263
Okay, here goes.

428
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:47,181
I've got a question.

429
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:50,476
What is it?

430
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:57,942
What if you find out that
Karatsu is not your perfect home.

431
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:00,987
Are you going to leave?

432
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:08,577
It seems impossible for Karatsu
to be an imperfect home.

433
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,330
You're here.

434
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:24,260
Then, let's add a little soy sauce.

435
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:26,304
I'm scared. What if I'm allergic?

436
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:27,930
You're allergic to this?

437
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,433
Not sure, I haven't tried them yet.

438
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:34,186
There are lots of these in Yobuko,
and you still haven't tried them?

439
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,315
I always buy squid, right?

440
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:40,318
Well, try it first to see
if you're allergic or not.

441
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:41,360
Sure.

442
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:44,697
You can just take meds later
if you get a reaction.

443
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,324
Here.

444
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,079
It's hot.

445
00:38:58,669 --> 00:38:59,628
Yummy?

446
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:00,671
Okay?

447
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:02,048
- Delicious.
- Okay.

448
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:04,175
Now it's your turn. Give it a try.

449
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:05,926
Here.

450
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:07,762
There.

451
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:09,305
Why do you remove this?

452
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:10,931
- There, you take it.
- Okay.

453
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:12,850
Let me show you. Then…

454
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:17,146
And then?

455
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:21,776
Lyn?

456
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,529
- Lynlyn!
- Lynlyn!

457
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:27,156
- Lynlyn!
- Lynlyn!

458
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:29,450
- Don't come near!
- She must have read it wrong.

459
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:31,786
Her ability never makes mistakes.

460
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:32,953
Lynlyn!

461
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:33,954
Lynlyn!

462
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:36,540
Lynlyn!

463
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:37,833
Stay away from her!

464
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:29,218
What's your plan?

465
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:33,722
Lynlyn?

466
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:37,435
Why the suitcase? You plan to leave?

467
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:45,734
This place isn't for me anymore.

468
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:50,156
There won't be a right place
for you, if you keep running.

469
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:55,077
What do you want me to do?

470
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:01,750
I suddenly became negative to you.

471
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:06,213
What did I do wrong? I don't understand.

472
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:18,100
This might be the pain
and sorrow you'll bring me.

473
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:22,438
Which one?

474
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:24,523
You leaving.

475
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,027
You abandoning me.

476
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,823
To be honest, Woody,

477
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:36,702
we've never seen our sister develop
strong feelings for someone before.

478
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:39,288
More strangely,

479
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:42,374
though you're a negative,
she still wants to be with you.

480
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:44,668
Once a negative, no chance at all.

481
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:51,675
Lynlyn.

482
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:53,928
What should I do?

483
00:41:57,306 --> 00:42:00,976
You might need to change something
to be positive again.

484
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:03,646
Tell me, what's wrong? What's wrong?

485
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:07,816
You tend to just run away.

486
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:13,739
Instead of facing the mess head-on,
you run from it.

487
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:29,838
Lynlyn?

488
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:31,966
Wait!

489
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,431
Give me a chance to change how you see me.

490
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:53,571
Three, Woody.

491
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:58,117
I'm giving you three chances
to be positive again.

492
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:02,246
If not…

493
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:07,001
sorry, but we can't
see each other anymore.

494
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:11,894
Yeah!

495
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:23,447
What happened to you?

496
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:26,992
I just have a slight fever, but I'm okay.

497
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:30,204
Where are Tantan, and Botbot?

498
00:46:31,997 --> 00:46:33,165
It's just me.

499
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:36,126
What?

500
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:37,753
I'm a negative, right?

501
00:46:37,836 --> 00:46:39,463
Why'd you come here alone?

502
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:40,923
I might harm you.

503
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:46,929
Are you ready to let me hold you again?

504
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,684
I don't know.

505
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:57,397
I don't want to waste
the three chances you gave me.

506
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:05,906
Delicious.

507
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:11,662
Wait, did you come here
without them knowing?

508
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:13,747
Yes.

509
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:17,918
Tantan will kill me

510
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:19,753
if he finds out that we're together.

511
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:23,090
Are you a bad person, Woody?

512
00:47:24,466 --> 00:47:25,509
I have no idea.

513
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:27,803
Do you hurt people?

514
00:47:27,886 --> 00:47:30,973
Do you have a history
of being violent and abusive?

515
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:35,018
So, why should I be afraid of you?

516
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:42,401
I want to try something.

517
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:45,028
Where are your clothes?

518
00:47:48,865 --> 00:47:49,950
Okay.

519
00:47:51,785 --> 00:47:52,703
Ready?

520
00:47:54,871 --> 00:47:57,207
Don't blame me if you get electrocuted.

521
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:02,879
Three, two, one.

522
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:09,428
What?

523
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:14,349
Nothing.

524
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:17,519
So?

525
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:19,313
What's this?

526
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:23,317
Did my negativity disappear,
or am I back to where I started?

527
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:25,319
I don't know.

528
00:48:26,903 --> 00:48:28,196
It just means that,

529
00:48:29,197 --> 00:48:33,785
my ability doesn't work
if I don't touch a person directly.

530
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:53,180
Are you satisfied with this?

531
00:48:58,352 --> 00:49:01,021
This is the only way
I can think of for now.

532
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:06,693
This isn't a solution.

533
00:49:10,572 --> 00:49:13,116
We need to get rid of my negativity.

534
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:23,043
Tell me about your life.

535
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:26,880
Maybe I can suggest something
if I get to know you better.

536
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:33,762
<i>When I was a teenager…</i>

537
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:37,724
my parents always used to fight.

538
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:42,646
And I kept avoiding it.

539
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:44,189
I just let them fight.

540
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:50,779
But, one day, their fight got
really heated.

541
00:49:52,989 --> 00:49:56,993
Mom grabbed Dad's gun
and threatened to end her life.

542
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:01,915
And then?

543
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:12,759
My dad panicked.

544
00:50:15,762 --> 00:50:17,639
He grabbed the gun from Mom.

545
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:23,145
It's the only time
I tried to intervene.

546
00:50:29,317 --> 00:50:31,278
I grabbed the gun…

547
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:39,536
I accidentally fired it.

548
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:51,339
I shot Dad's shoulder.

549
00:50:58,096 --> 00:51:00,474
He was really mad at me, he slapped me.

550
00:51:06,813 --> 00:51:08,648
Then he had a heart attack.

551
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:26,416
My mom was surprised to find out that…

552
00:51:28,376 --> 00:51:29,961
in my dad's last will,

553
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:37,511
he left everything to me,
all the money, the properties.

554
00:51:42,724 --> 00:51:45,393
And when I turned 18,
I gave her five percent.

555
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:48,438
I left and never showed up again.

556
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:55,987
So, she's okay with the five percent?

557
00:51:58,824 --> 00:51:59,950
Of course not.

558
00:52:01,117 --> 00:52:01,993
She got angry.

559
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:05,914
She called me ungrateful.

560
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:10,460
So, you never spoke to her again?

561
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:13,547
Never.

562
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:16,842
That's it.

563
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:20,136
Maybe you need to make amends.

564
00:52:20,762 --> 00:52:22,722
Your anger seems to be intense.

565
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:26,977
She doesn't care about me,
and I couldn't care less.

566
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:28,979
All she wants is the inheritance.

567
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:30,897
Ouch.

568
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:34,276
You're running away again.

569
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:37,988
Face it.

570
00:52:39,364 --> 00:52:40,448
Sort it out.

571
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:45,495
<i>Ma.</i>

572
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:48,081
<i>The lawyer called me.</i>

573
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:52,752
<i>You're passing on half of your inheritance</i>
<i>from your dad to me?</i>

574
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:55,505
Yes.

575
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:00,260
<i>Why?</i>

576
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:09,811
I don't know why Dad
didn't include you in his last will.

577
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:13,940
Maybe because you were always fighting.

578
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:16,818
You always got on his nerves.

579
00:53:20,488 --> 00:53:21,948
But I'm not Dad.

580
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:28,079
I can make my own decisions.

581
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:30,332
I have my own experiences with you.

582
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:37,797
You're not perfect, far from it, but…

583
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:41,509
you don't deserve
to be disregarded at all.

584
00:53:43,094 --> 00:53:46,932
<i>I'm sorry for not being</i>
<i>a good mother to you.</i>

585
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:49,851
<i>Thank you.</i>

586
00:53:49,935 --> 00:53:52,979
<i>But I can't accept what you're offering…</i>

587
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,943
<i>until the day I hear from you that</i>

588
00:53:58,526 --> 00:54:01,279
<i>you've forgiven me</i>
<i>for all my shortcomings…</i>

589
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:02,864
<i>to you and to your dad.</i>

590
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:11,164
I forgive you, Ma.

591
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:26,680
Don't do anything stupid.

592
00:54:29,015 --> 00:54:30,308
Shall we try again?

593
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:47,659
Lynlyn!

594
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:49,536
Are you okay?

595
00:54:58,503 --> 00:55:01,172
- Lynlyn…
- I'll shout if something bad happens.

596
00:55:07,095 --> 00:55:08,680
<i>Your dad is gone, right?</i>

597
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:16,354
But you said he slapped you
before he had a heart attack.

598
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:21,860
Have you forgiven him?

599
00:55:21,943 --> 00:55:26,698
Or was inheriting such a large amount
enough for you to overlook that?

600
00:55:31,911 --> 00:55:33,913
I accepted being slapped by him.

601
00:55:35,373 --> 00:55:39,502
I did shoot him, so it feels like
I deserved to be slapped.

602
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:41,671
It wasn't intentional, right?

603
00:55:48,094 --> 00:55:51,765
How do you forgive someone
who can no longer ask for forgiveness?

604
00:55:56,644 --> 00:55:58,354
Was he a terrible dad to you?

605
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:10,158
No.

606
00:56:12,952 --> 00:56:14,537
He wasn't an ideal father.

607
00:56:17,415 --> 00:56:19,125
But he wasn't bad either.

608
00:56:23,004 --> 00:56:24,506
Actually, I admired him.

609
00:56:26,424 --> 00:56:28,134
Grandpa was a drunkard.

610
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:32,597
So he was often the subject
of physical abuse when he was young.

611
00:56:33,681 --> 00:56:36,267
He was forced to work even as a minor.

612
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:40,897
But…

613
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:44,234
he managed to succeed despite that.

614
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:50,240
It's just his childhood traumas
were never resolved.

615
00:56:50,323 --> 00:56:52,033
So, when provoked…

616
00:56:53,326 --> 00:56:54,869
he would become violent.

617
00:56:59,624 --> 00:57:01,876
So you do understand your Dad.

618
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:08,299
Everything seems to make sense now.

619
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:11,052
Now that I think about it.

620
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:16,641
Thank you for your intervention.

621
00:57:21,479 --> 00:57:24,065
Even if he didn't ask for forgiveness,

622
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:29,654
maybe understanding him
is enough for you to forgive him.

623
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:25,793
Turn around.

624
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:51,277
Lynlyn?

625
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:53,446
Lynlyn?

626
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:56,574
Are you okay?

627
00:58:58,117 --> 00:58:59,202
Strike two.

628
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:12,173
You still have one more chance, Woody.

629
00:59:15,134 --> 00:59:16,261
Just have faith.

630
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:29,774
Yes!

631
00:59:33,319 --> 00:59:35,029
Tantan, I have a question.

632
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:37,615
It's kind of philosophical.

633
00:59:39,033 --> 00:59:40,118
What?

634
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:42,579
For example,

635
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:45,206
a person's life is only
a hundred days long…

636
00:59:46,332 --> 00:59:50,378
If within 99 days,
that person made you happy,

637
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:54,340
then on the 100th day, he hurt you,

638
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:56,509
what do you think is he?

639
00:59:57,302 --> 00:59:59,178
Positive, or negative?

640
01:00:01,222 --> 01:00:03,057
Open up!

641
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:06,436
Lynlyn! Let me in!

642
01:00:06,519 --> 01:00:07,562
What…

643
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:12,525
What if on the third touch,
I'm still a negative?

644
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:15,903
Are we just going to forget each other?

645
01:00:15,987 --> 01:00:16,988
Hey, Woody!

646
01:00:17,071 --> 01:00:18,156
Woody!

647
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:22,660
I'll just accept everything!

648
01:00:22,744 --> 01:00:23,620
Woody?

649
01:00:23,703 --> 01:00:25,538
That no one loved me!

650
01:00:26,164 --> 01:00:29,167
That no one will love me until I die.

651
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:34,881
I'm not…

652
01:00:43,973 --> 01:00:45,099
Lynlyn!

653
01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:53,691
Lynlyn!

654
01:00:54,567 --> 01:00:56,486
I'm not a bad person,

655
01:00:56,569 --> 01:00:58,529
why are you pushing me away?

656
01:00:58,613 --> 01:01:01,574
- Lynlyn, let go.
- Lynlyn!

657
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:04,160
Lynlyn, let go!

658
01:01:43,449 --> 01:01:44,450
So what now?

659
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:48,121
You proud of what you did last night?

660
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:57,046
You know, I think you became negative
towards my sister because…

661
01:01:58,131 --> 01:02:00,383
you became too obsessed with her.

662
01:02:01,342 --> 01:02:04,303
And that obsession is dangerous.

663
01:02:09,183 --> 01:02:10,893
What else can I do?

664
01:02:16,107 --> 01:02:17,608
Maybe you're forgetting.

665
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:20,778
You've used up all three chances.

666
01:02:24,031 --> 01:02:27,744
Can I talk to her
even if it's the last time?

667
01:02:38,379 --> 01:02:39,964
Is this really necessary?

668
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:41,841
I can't take chances.

669
01:02:50,224 --> 01:02:51,184
What?

670
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:01,110
Lynlyn?

671
01:03:05,239 --> 01:03:06,574
I just want…

672
01:03:07,825 --> 01:03:09,410
I just want to thank you…

673
01:03:11,245 --> 01:03:12,288
because…

674
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:16,501
you gave me a chance to try and…

675
01:03:16,584 --> 01:03:18,377
change your perception of me.

676
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:24,300
Not everyone with negative traits
gets that opportunity.

677
01:03:27,428 --> 01:03:29,514
I just want you to be happy,

678
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:33,059
despite…

679
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:37,355
your situation.

680
01:03:42,944 --> 01:03:44,612
You won't see me again.

681
01:03:48,324 --> 01:03:51,702
Should we run into each other,
I'll be the one to avoid you…

682
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:55,623
so as not to bother you.

683
01:05:23,336 --> 01:05:24,795
Sorry.

684
01:05:30,801 --> 01:05:32,386
Sorry, Woody.

685
01:05:38,851 --> 01:05:39,977
I'm sorry.

686
01:05:40,061 --> 01:05:41,312
It's nothing.

687
01:05:41,395 --> 01:05:43,606
You didn't do anything wrong.

688
01:05:46,817 --> 01:05:48,778
Your ability said otherwise.

689
01:06:45,209 --> 01:06:46,210
Lynlyn?

690
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:53,843
Your hand.

691
01:06:55,136 --> 01:06:56,387
You cut your palm.

692
01:06:57,096 --> 01:06:58,014
Let me handle that.

693
01:07:09,650 --> 01:07:10,651
Negative?

694
01:07:11,485 --> 01:07:12,611
Tantan?

695
01:07:16,282 --> 01:07:17,116
Tantan!

696
01:07:21,245 --> 01:07:23,164
- Tantan!
- Tantan!

697
01:07:23,247 --> 01:07:25,624
- Tantan!
- Don't come any closer!

698
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:27,168
Your hand!

699
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:29,670
I'll take care of it!

700
01:07:29,754 --> 01:07:31,589
Let me handle it!

701
01:07:31,672 --> 01:07:33,049
Why don't you want me to?

702
01:07:33,799 --> 01:07:35,051
I am negative, right?

703
01:07:35,134 --> 01:07:37,219
But you're still my brother, right?

704
01:07:39,472 --> 01:07:40,973
Let me do it!

705
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:50,274
Give it to me!

706
01:07:56,781 --> 01:07:57,990
Lynlyn!

707
01:07:58,074 --> 01:07:59,492
- I'm okay!
- Why do you insist?

708
01:07:59,575 --> 01:08:00,701
- Let me!
- No, let me!

709
01:08:33,192 --> 01:08:34,485
Why?

710
01:08:40,741 --> 01:08:42,076
You no longer get shocked?

711
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:46,747
It's over.

712
01:08:50,042 --> 01:08:51,043
It's over.

713
01:08:58,384 --> 01:09:00,469
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

714
01:09:02,471 --> 01:09:03,514
What's that?

715
01:09:05,891 --> 01:09:10,229
I'm thinking, what if you didn't
insist on helping Tantan…

716
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:14,358
maybe he won't be back
to being positive again.

717
01:09:17,069 --> 01:09:18,279
What do you mean?

718
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:27,037
It means your meddling played a part
in changing your perspective of someone.

719
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:33,252
So, you're saying…

720
01:09:33,794 --> 01:09:36,630
Woody needs direct help from our sister,

721
01:09:36,714 --> 01:09:38,883
so her negative read would reverse?

722
01:09:52,605 --> 01:09:53,606
Help?

723
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:58,903
<i>I used to like helping people.</i>

724
01:09:58,986 --> 01:10:00,571
<i>I meddle in people's affairs.</i>

725
01:10:01,363 --> 01:10:03,616
Excuse me. What would you like to buy?

726
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:04,992
Um, just one.

727
01:10:06,285 --> 01:10:08,454
Let… Let me show you.

728
01:10:08,537 --> 01:10:11,040
- Okay.
- You just need to put it here.

729
01:10:12,666 --> 01:10:13,500
And then…

730
01:10:13,584 --> 01:10:15,002
- Which one was it?
- This one.

731
01:10:15,836 --> 01:10:17,880
Just click it, and it will come out.

732
01:10:18,589 --> 01:10:20,216
It's that simple.

733
01:10:20,299 --> 01:10:21,884
- Okay.
- Thank you.

734
01:10:21,967 --> 01:10:24,178
- You're welcome. Enjoy.
- Thank you.

735
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:36,023
Thank you.

736
01:10:49,870 --> 01:10:53,999
<i>But don't forget that</i>
<i>your overly helpful nature,</i>

737
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:56,335
<i>was the reason</i>
<i>you got into trouble before.</i>

738
01:10:56,418 --> 01:10:58,087
Excuse me! Excuse me!

739
01:10:59,213 --> 01:11:00,422
Please help me.

740
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:02,216
My daughter…

741
01:11:02,716 --> 01:11:04,301
She ran into the woods.

742
01:11:04,385 --> 01:11:05,427
I can't find her.

743
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:07,137
Calm down.

744
01:11:07,221 --> 01:11:08,305
Just stay calm.

745
01:11:08,389 --> 01:11:09,807
We'll find her.

746
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:11,225
Don't worry.

747
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:14,311
Your daughter…

748
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:17,231
what was she wearing?

749
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:19,358
A yellow jacket…

750
01:11:19,441 --> 01:11:21,360
and a white skirt.

751
01:11:21,443 --> 01:11:23,821
How about the beach?
Have you searched the beach?

752
01:11:39,086 --> 01:11:40,087
Help!

753
01:11:42,214 --> 01:11:43,674
Help!

754
01:11:49,471 --> 01:11:50,931
Help!

755
01:11:53,350 --> 01:11:55,019
Help!

756
01:11:55,602 --> 01:11:57,062
Help!

757
01:12:02,818 --> 01:12:04,111
Help!

758
01:13:15,724 --> 01:13:18,477
If that didn't happen,
I wouldn't be like this.

759
01:13:19,937 --> 01:13:21,563
But did it make you happy?

760
01:13:22,439 --> 01:13:24,775
She's shielded from dangerous people.

761
01:13:25,526 --> 01:13:28,028
- Isn't that a blessing?
- Blessing? More like a curse.

762
01:13:28,112 --> 01:13:31,532
- Not everyone has that ability.
- But does it make her happy?

763
01:13:31,615 --> 01:13:34,493
My life just revolves around
avoiding pain.

764
01:13:35,327 --> 01:13:37,204
Evading danger.

765
01:13:42,167 --> 01:13:43,043
I give up.

766
01:13:43,877 --> 01:13:44,795
Lynlyn!

767
01:13:45,504 --> 01:13:46,338
Lynlyn!

768
01:13:48,507 --> 01:13:49,383
Lynlyn.

769
01:13:51,301 --> 01:13:55,097
I got this curse from this place.
Maybe it can also take it back.

770
01:13:57,015 --> 01:13:59,476
- Lynlyn, enough!
- I said I'm done, Tantan.

771
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:01,103
I'm tired of all of this!

772
01:14:02,604 --> 01:14:05,399
Do you never get tired
of watching over me?

773
01:14:08,235 --> 01:14:09,445
I'm so sick of it!

774
01:14:12,197 --> 01:14:14,950
Let's free ourselves, all of us.

775
01:14:29,214 --> 01:14:30,048
Woody?

776
01:14:41,101 --> 01:14:42,102
Woody.

777
01:14:46,940 --> 01:14:47,900
You're here.

778
01:14:49,776 --> 01:14:51,153
Don't come near me.

779
01:14:53,363 --> 01:14:55,240
I just might eat you alive.

780
01:15:01,455 --> 01:15:02,956
What are you doing here?

781
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:06,126
I'm going for a swim…

782
01:15:08,086 --> 01:15:10,130
before flying to another country.

783
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:14,510
You want to know where I'm going?
I'll show you.

784
01:15:19,806 --> 01:15:22,851
Tierra del Fuego in Argentina.

785
01:15:26,271 --> 01:15:27,648
That's very far.

786
01:15:29,274 --> 01:15:31,193
It's close to Antarctica.

787
01:15:33,362 --> 01:15:35,447
Maybe I'll find peace there.

788
01:15:42,579 --> 01:15:43,455
Woody.

789
01:15:46,667 --> 01:15:47,501
Woody.

790
01:15:57,302 --> 01:15:58,929
Woody! Woody!

791
01:15:59,012 --> 01:16:01,265
No.

792
01:16:01,974 --> 01:16:04,059
Why do you keep following me?

793
01:16:06,770 --> 01:16:09,398
Didn't your ability
say that I'll hurt you?

794
01:16:10,649 --> 01:16:11,900
Leave!

795
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:14,570
Go away!

796
01:16:16,655 --> 01:16:17,739
I don't…

797
01:16:18,907 --> 01:16:20,409
I don't want to hurt you.

798
01:16:24,162 --> 01:16:25,664
I don't want to hurt you.

799
01:16:29,585 --> 01:16:30,919
Please leave.

800
01:16:32,170 --> 01:16:33,005
Woody?

801
01:16:39,928 --> 01:16:42,723
No one will ever love me!

802
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:45,017
Woody, stop.

803
01:16:49,479 --> 01:16:51,023
That's enough.

804
01:17:03,452 --> 01:17:04,745
Stop.

805
01:17:28,935 --> 01:17:29,936
Woody?

806
01:17:32,689 --> 01:17:33,690
Woody?

807
01:17:48,455 --> 01:17:49,414
Woody?

808
01:17:50,624 --> 01:17:51,667
Woody?

809
01:17:54,294 --> 01:17:55,295
- Woody!
- Lynlyn!

810
01:17:59,216 --> 01:18:00,634
- Woody!
- Hey!

811
01:18:01,468 --> 01:18:02,427
Lynlyn?

812
01:18:03,762 --> 01:18:04,721
Why?

813
01:18:06,848 --> 01:18:09,393
You aren't flinching
even if you touch him.

814
01:18:09,476 --> 01:18:10,560
Yes!

815
01:18:11,478 --> 01:18:12,854
Is he positive now, Lynlyn?

816
01:18:16,066 --> 01:18:18,110
No, I don't feel anything.

817
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:33,875
This means…

818
01:18:35,252 --> 01:18:36,253
I…

819
01:18:38,463 --> 01:18:39,923
I no longer…

820
01:18:44,511 --> 01:18:45,679
Nothing!

821
01:19:32,934 --> 01:19:34,060
Good morning.

822
01:19:41,651 --> 01:19:43,028
No, don't!

823
01:19:46,156 --> 01:19:47,199
Calm down.

824
01:19:49,493 --> 01:19:52,037
You have a negative read on me, right?

825
01:19:59,669 --> 01:20:01,129
My ability is gone.

826
01:20:11,973 --> 01:20:12,974
Try it.

827
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:35,121
What'd I tell you?

828
01:21:11,575 --> 01:21:13,577
It's a huge world we're living in, right?

829
01:21:14,703 --> 01:21:17,831
How many more places
can we visit in our entire lives?

830
01:21:21,418 --> 01:21:22,502
I don't know.

831
01:21:23,211 --> 01:21:24,713
But…

832
01:21:25,755 --> 01:21:26,923
I feel like…

833
01:21:29,801 --> 01:21:31,094
we will see a lot from now.

834
01:21:37,893 --> 01:21:42,647
The <i>yokai</i> in the forest
didn't just grant me that ability.

835
01:21:45,650 --> 01:21:47,068
Why? What happened?

836
01:21:50,363 --> 01:21:53,825
I was in the forest because
I was helping someone.

837
01:21:56,578 --> 01:21:58,622
But he took advantage of me.

838
01:22:01,499 --> 01:22:03,084
Took advantage, as in, he…

839
01:22:13,637 --> 01:22:14,804
I'm sorry.

840
01:22:17,933 --> 01:22:21,561
I want you to know that as long as
I'm here, no one will hurt you.

841
01:22:24,564 --> 01:22:25,732
Thank you, Woody.

842
01:22:33,073 --> 01:22:34,491
But I just thought…

843
01:22:35,659 --> 01:22:37,160
Your ability is gone, right?

844
01:22:38,995 --> 01:22:42,290
Your ability is gone,
but my negative side didn't disappear.

845
01:22:44,334 --> 01:22:47,170
What if, at some point,
I end up hurting you, too?

846
01:22:50,298 --> 01:22:51,716
Don't hurt me.

847
01:22:55,470 --> 01:22:58,014
What if I unintentionally hurt you?

848
01:23:01,226 --> 01:23:03,353
Then ask for forgiveness.

849
01:23:06,189 --> 01:23:09,359
And learn from what happened
so you won't do it again.

850
01:23:11,319 --> 01:23:14,698
That's what I'd do
if I end up hurting you.

851
01:23:22,163 --> 01:23:23,748
You're overthinking it.

852
01:23:24,374 --> 01:23:26,459
I'm not a perfect person either.

853
01:23:27,043 --> 01:23:29,921
Surely you'll also see an ugly side of me.

854
01:23:31,006 --> 01:23:34,634
What's important is we're both
willing to ask for forgiveness.

855
01:23:38,430 --> 01:23:41,016
<i>But why would you waste your time on me if</i>

856
01:23:41,099 --> 01:23:43,476
<i>you're not sure if</i>
<i>I'm a good person or not?</i>

857
01:23:46,771 --> 01:23:48,523
<i>Because I care about you.</i>

858
01:23:59,284 --> 01:24:02,454
<i>And I believe that</i>
<i>you can heal your wounds.</i>

859
01:24:12,547 --> 01:24:13,548
<i>Can you do it?</i>

860
01:24:16,509 --> 01:24:17,635
<i>I can.</i>

861
01:25:27,372 --> 01:25:29,791
JAPANESE STYLE PUB

862
01:25:31,459 --> 01:25:33,711
There aren't many Filipinos here, right?

863
01:25:33,795 --> 01:25:34,671
Yes.

864
01:25:37,132 --> 01:25:40,635
If someone were to open a Filipino resto,
you think it'd be a hit?

865
01:25:43,263 --> 01:25:46,474
Filipino food is greasy, right?

866
01:25:47,559 --> 01:25:49,269
The Japanese don't like that.

867
01:25:50,395 --> 01:25:51,896
Are you planning on it?

868
01:25:57,402 --> 01:25:59,571
Sorry, I just got a message.

869
01:25:59,654 --> 01:26:00,947
What's that? Oily?

870
01:26:07,412 --> 01:26:08,621
I love you.

871
01:26:09,497 --> 01:26:10,623
"I too love you…"

872
01:26:11,749 --> 01:26:12,959
"I you love."

873
01:26:14,002 --> 01:26:15,253
"Do me too love you?"

874
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:17,881
Almost there. You can do it.

875
01:26:17,964 --> 01:26:18,923
"Do me love you"?

876
01:26:19,924 --> 01:26:21,301
I can't remember.

877
01:26:22,844 --> 01:26:24,262
Let's just go with this.

878
01:26:31,394 --> 01:26:33,438
I love you.

879
01:26:34,230 --> 01:26:35,190
That's it.

880
01:26:37,358 --> 01:26:38,401
Noted.

881
01:26:51,456 --> 01:26:53,291
I have something I want to share.

882
01:26:54,667 --> 01:26:55,668
Is it okay?

883
01:26:57,962 --> 01:26:59,047
What is it?

884
01:27:01,841 --> 01:27:05,011
Do you think if you still had
your previous ability…

885
01:27:07,555 --> 01:27:09,098
I would still be negative?

886
01:27:18,733 --> 01:27:23,321
Even though I don't have the ability
anymore, I know you're a positive for me.

887
01:27:29,911 --> 01:27:32,580
I was chatting with Mom earlier.

888
01:27:34,582 --> 01:27:37,418
She was asking when I could visit.

889
01:27:39,504 --> 01:27:40,880
Why? What's going on?

890
01:27:45,134 --> 01:27:47,762
She didn't mention anything specific, but…

891
01:27:50,598 --> 01:27:55,270
she hinted that she's not feeling well.

892
01:27:57,355 --> 01:27:58,564
She's getting weak.

893
01:28:00,942 --> 01:28:04,404
That maybe she doesn't have long to live.

894
01:28:09,575 --> 01:28:10,910
What are you planning?

895
01:28:16,541 --> 01:28:17,792
I don't know.

896
01:28:30,221 --> 01:28:31,806
How do you feel?

897
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:35,601
About what?

898
01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:38,646
About your Mom's situation.

899
01:28:39,355 --> 01:28:40,606
I really don't know.

900
01:28:47,405 --> 01:28:48,614
Sorry.

901
01:29:05,631 --> 01:29:08,343
Wasn't your Dad's death sudden?

902
01:29:12,555 --> 01:29:14,223
What does that have to do with it?

903
01:29:18,811 --> 01:29:21,939
If your Mom's already
feeling these things…

904
01:29:25,735 --> 01:29:27,612
could you handle it if…

905
01:29:29,322 --> 01:29:31,282
she were to suddenly pass away?

906
01:29:34,660 --> 01:29:37,163
Without even talking to her, or…

907
01:29:37,246 --> 01:29:39,749
being there for here, in the flesh.

908
01:29:57,183 --> 01:29:58,267
I'm running late.

909
01:29:58,351 --> 01:29:59,936
- I'll go ahead, okay?
- Sure.

910
01:30:00,019 --> 01:30:01,771
- I'll join you!
- Hurry up!

911
01:30:01,854 --> 01:30:03,815
I might be late for our practice.

912
01:30:03,898 --> 01:30:05,817
- Okay.
- Our stage play is coming up.

913
01:30:05,900 --> 01:30:08,444
We'll watch it, right?
Tickets for me and Woody!

914
01:30:09,278 --> 01:30:10,822
Take care, both of you!

915
01:30:12,990 --> 01:30:15,326
Lynlyn, when is Woody coming home?

916
01:30:15,409 --> 01:30:17,703
- Tomorrow.
- Will you pick him up in Fukuoka?

917
01:30:17,787 --> 01:30:19,205
- I'll come along?
- Sure.

918
01:30:19,288 --> 01:30:20,832
- Botbot!
- Yes, I'm coming!

919
01:30:20,915 --> 01:30:21,916
Take care!

920
01:30:45,815 --> 01:30:47,024
Hello.

921
01:30:47,108 --> 01:30:50,194
<i>Hello? Is this Erlinda Lumanay?</i>

922
01:30:52,155 --> 01:30:53,990
Yes. Who is this?

923
01:30:54,740 --> 01:30:56,242
<i>Attorney Diego San Pedro.</i>

924
01:30:56,325 --> 01:30:58,202
<i>Family lawyer of Woody Carrera.</i>

925
01:31:00,621 --> 01:31:01,622
Why?

926
01:31:02,331 --> 01:31:04,417
<i>I regret to inform you.</i>

927
01:31:04,500 --> 01:31:05,960
<i>Woody has passed away.</i>

928
01:31:08,754 --> 01:31:10,590
<i>He just arrived in Manila when</i>

929
01:31:10,673 --> 01:31:13,676
<i>he was suddenly hit by</i>
<i>a truck that lost its brakes.</i>

930
01:31:19,891 --> 01:31:22,101
<i>Before he took his last breath,</i>

931
01:31:22,185 --> 01:31:24,729
<i>his last wish was to tell you that…</i>

932
01:31:28,482 --> 01:31:29,942
<i>he loves you very much.</i>

933
01:32:26,499 --> 01:32:31,295
<i>Perhaps, this is why</i>
<i>I used to have a negative read on you.</i>

934
01:32:33,256 --> 01:32:37,885
<i>But he also brought joy</i>
<i>to my life, didn't he?</i>

935
01:32:40,346 --> 01:32:41,264
<i>What a mess.</i>

936
01:32:45,393 --> 01:32:48,020
<i>But what he is doesn't matter</i>
<i>to me anymore.</i>

937
01:32:49,522 --> 01:32:54,402
<i>People who bring happiness to us,</i>
<i>can also hurt us…</i>

938
01:32:55,653 --> 01:32:57,822
<i>whether they intend to</i>
<i>or not.</i>

939
01:32:58,781 --> 01:33:00,199
<i>As long as it is clear.</i>

940
01:33:02,285 --> 01:33:03,119
En-Ya!

941
01:33:03,786 --> 01:33:05,329
En-Ya!

942
01:33:05,413 --> 01:33:06,914
En-Ya!

943
01:33:06,998 --> 01:33:07,832
En-Ya!

944
01:33:08,582 --> 01:33:09,834
En-Ya!

945
01:33:09,917 --> 01:33:11,210
En-Ya!

946
01:33:11,294 --> 01:33:12,628
En-Ya!

947
01:33:12,712 --> 01:33:13,546
En-Ya!

948
01:33:16,841 --> 01:33:17,842
<i>En-Ya!</i>

949
01:33:19,593 --> 01:33:20,636
<i>En-Ya!</i>

950
01:33:28,853 --> 01:33:29,812
<i>En-Ya!</i>

951
01:33:30,438 --> 01:33:34,525
<i>En-Ya! En-Ya! En-Ya!</i>

952
01:33:34,608 --> 01:33:39,530
<i>En-Ya! En-Ya! En-Ya!</i>

953
01:34:54,939 --> 01:34:55,981
<i>I love you…</i>

954
01:34:56,899 --> 01:34:57,900
<i>Woody-san.</i>
