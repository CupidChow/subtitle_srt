So hot...

So hot...

3
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:50,439
Feeling better?

4
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,600
Still hot?

5
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,240
So hot...

6
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:08,480
Better now?

7
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,400
So hot...

8
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,239
Can I

9
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:35,719
stay by your side forever?

24
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:02,319
You said you were hot,

25
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,800
so I took it off

26
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,840
to help you cool down.

27
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:10,840
The bite mark on your chest was from...

28
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,439
My lady.

29
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,919
You're lying.

30
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,680
N-No, I'm not.

31
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,800
I'm telling the truth.

32
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:22,599
My lady,

33
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,039
why do I recall you 'groping' me?

34
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:26,280
How do you

35
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:28,520
explain this otherwise?

36
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,319
Nonsense.

37
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,800
I didn't 'grope' you.

38
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,400
I did nothing at all.

39
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,439
It was you who...

40
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,520
So I initiated it?

41
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,439
But you were rather forceful.

42
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,479
But since you care for me,

43
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:43,919
I don't mind being 'groped'.

44
00:03:45,824 --> 00:03:46,840
I'll take responsibility.

45
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:48,479
Li Ya'er.

46
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,199
Don't flatter yourself.

47
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:51,840
There's nothing between us.

48
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:53,199
Take a good look

49
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,360
at yourself in the mirror.

50
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,479
You despise me so much?

51
00:03:59,159 --> 00:03:59,639
Yeah.

52
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:00,919
I absolutely loathe you.

53
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:01,960
Li Ya'er.

54
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,159
Remember.

55
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,719
You're my sworn enemy.

56
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,479
If I find out you're related

57
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:08,840
to my sister and father's deaths,

58
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,759
I'll kill you myself.

59
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:13,199
Fine.

60
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:14,719
Why bother saving me?

61
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,240
Kill me now.

62
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:18,959
Wu Ya'er.

63
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,959
How dare you speak to me like this?

64
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,759
Wu Ya'er?

65
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,360
Wu Ya'er is dead.

66
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,519
This is Li Ya'er.

67
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,040
Why would I not dare?

68
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:30,399
Very well.

69
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:32,160
I shouldn't have saved you.

70
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,480
Let me reclaim your life now.

71
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,639
"Reclaim"?

72
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,360
What are you doing?

73
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:39,959
For real...?

74
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:41,160
I'll kill you.

75
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,279
You missed.

76
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:48,399
Ya'er.

77
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:49,360
Ya'er.

78
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,839
Ya'er, are you hurt?

79
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,079
Why didn't you dodge?

80
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:54,439
Does it hurt?

81
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,360
My lady.

82
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:04,000
What happened?

83
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:05,920
Where are we?

84
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:08,639
You...

85
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,839
Weren't we avoiding the worm?

86
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,319
How did we end up here?

87
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,319
You don't remember?

88
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,279
Remember what?

89
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:19,079
You are...

90
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,560
I'm Wu Ya'er.

91
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:22,720
My lady.

92
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,439
Have you lost your memory?

93
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,360
Why am I tied up?

94
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:29,959
Exactly.

95
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:31,920
Who tied you up and threw rocks at you?

96
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:38,839
What's going on here?

97
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:49,879
It hurts.

98
00:05:51,008 --> 00:05:54,120
You... truly remember nothing?

99
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:56,199
Nothing at all.

100
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:58,120
Did you carry me here,

101
00:05:58,279 --> 00:05:59,079
my lady?

102
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,000
Y-Yeah, I did.

103
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:05,600
You're so nice to me.

104
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,360
You saved me again.

105
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,519
You saved me first.

106
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:10,639
We're even now.

107
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:11,839
I vowed that

108
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,319
I'll always be

109
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,519
indebted to you.

110
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:19,120
If you remembered,

111
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,680
you wouldn't say that.

112
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,879
If I regain my memories,

113
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:23,680
hit my head with a rock again

114
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:24,759
to make me forget.

115
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:29,399
Li Ya'er.

116
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,920
When did I say that

117
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:33,600
I hit your head with a rock?

118
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,424
You put on a good act, huh?

119
00:06:35,424 --> 00:06:35,944
Just a guess.

120
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:36,680
Just a guess.

121
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:38,040
When did I ever say that?

122
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,800
Just a guess.

123
00:06:39,488 --> 00:06:40,096
Don't kick me.

124
00:06:40,096 --> 00:06:40,800
You...

125
00:06:40,998 --> 00:06:42,368
You're quite the performer, huh?

126
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:43,008
You...

127
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:43,969
Get down here.

128
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:45,879
Get down here!

129
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,040
You...

130
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,160
Stop chasing me.

131
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,079
You crafty man.

132
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:51,639
You...

133
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,399
My head hurts.

134
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:52,992
Cut the act.

135
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,720
Stop chasing me.

136
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,120
You...

137
00:06:55,776 --> 00:06:57,056
Have you seen a man and a woman?

138
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:58,720
No.

139
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,839
- Have you seen a man and a woman?
- Tell us if you see anything.

140
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:04,040
Yes, officers.

141
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:04,920
Move along.

142
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,279
Sir.

143
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:11,120
We found two sets of footprints

144
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,040
heading north.

145
00:07:12,512 --> 00:07:14,112
It must be the princess and that slave.

146
00:07:14,528 --> 00:07:15,079
Excellent.

147
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:15,759
Get my horse.

148
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:16,720
I'll go find her.

149
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:17,600
Sir.

150
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:18,920
One more thing.

151
00:07:21,376 --> 00:07:23,392
(Prescription)

152
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:26,959
This paper

153
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:28,439
is imperial-grade.

154
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,040
That's right.

155
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:31,360
The barbarians rebelled,

156
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,199
which led to decreased production.

157
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:35,399
Only a few departments
can afford it now.

158
00:07:36,696 --> 00:07:37,536
Where did you get it?

159
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:39,279
The witch doctor

160
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:40,279
wrote this prescription

161
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,120
for a villager's foul sore.

162
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:45,439
So the Worm Sorcerer

163
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:46,639
is someone we know.

164
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:48,680
Look into it.

165
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:49,399
Understood.

166
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:57,120
Ling.

167
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:02,839
Excuse me.

168
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:06,720
Anyone here?

169
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,639
Who are you?

170
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,040
Granny.

171
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,399
Can we stay here for a night?

172
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,000
What happened to you two?

173
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:23,480
My wife and I are from Shendu.

174
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:24,879
We've been traveling

175
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:25,959
and seeking shelter.

176
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,439
Could you take us in for the night?

177
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,720
We'll repay your kindness.

178
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:31,800
I don't need repayment.

179
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,039
You're welcome to stay

180
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,320
in my humble cottage.

181
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,080
I happen to have

182
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,039
a spare room.

183
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:39,200
Alright. Come on in.

184
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,080
Thank you so much.

185
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:42,399
Come on in.

186
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,639
Come on.

187
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:57,000
Why did you say

188
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,120
that we're married?

189
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:02,720
Didn't you notice that

190
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,840
there are only two rooms?

191
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,519
If I hadn't said we're married,

192
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,440
the granny would find it troublesome

193
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:10,320
to take us in.

194
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,960
I could've shared

195
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,840
a room with Granny.

196
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:17,480
You didn't have to lie.

197
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,000
Why?

198
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:20,559
Because

199
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:23,279
we should maintain boundaries.

200
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:29,279
Don't you think it's a bit late

201
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,000
to say that?

202
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:32,240
You weren't like this.

203
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,320
You stripped my clothes,

204
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:35,799
saw me naked,

205
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:38,759
and 'groped' me in that cottage.

206
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,519
Why are you so reserved now?

207
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,440
You...

208
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:44,039
Who 'groped' you,

209
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,039
saw you naked,

210
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,175
or stripped your clothes?

211
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:47,639
Besides, that was Wu Ya'er,

212
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:48,360
not Li Ya'er.

213
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,679
What's the difference?

214
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:55,080
I'm always me.

215
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:57,799
At least, Wu Ya'er wouldn't talk back.

216
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,440
Li Ya'er only spouts nonsense.

217
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,039
Fine.

218
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:02,840
My lady's word is law.

219
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:05,840
Wu Ya'er is better.

220
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:07,799
Wu Ya'er spoils his lady.

221
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,559
Li Ya'er only annoys his lady.

222
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,600
Alright?

223
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:12,320
Your tongue's dipped in venom.

224
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:13,600
Wu Ya'er isn't like this.

225
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,159
What's so great about Wu Ya'er?

226
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:21,159
Wu Ya'er is

227
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,519
simple, sincere, and kind.

228
00:10:24,896 --> 00:10:25,679
He's way better.

229
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:28,000
You like Wu Ya'er that much?

230
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,679
I can be Wu Ya'er forever.

231
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,320
Who wants you to play dumb?

232
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,799
Then hit me with another rock

233
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:43,759
to knock me out.

234
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:45,440
I've got rocks here.

235
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:50,200
Sounds like a good idea.

236
00:10:52,928 --> 00:10:53,360
You...

237
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:54,559
You're serious?

238
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:55,879
Turn into Wu Ya'er.

239
00:10:56,064 --> 00:10:56,608
You...

240
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,840
I'll fight back.

241
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,759
How dare you?

242
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,240
Wu Ya'er is obedient.

243
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,559
He won't fight back.

244
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:02,440
Says who?

245
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,000
He doesn't...

246
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,440
Are you okay?

247
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:13,279
Granny.

248
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,320
We're fine.

249
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:16,480
We're just making the bed.

250
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,840
Good.

251
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:22,799
There are evil spirits.

252
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:24,440
Don't go outside.

253
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:26,919
Evil spirits?

254
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:29,480
Six months ago, a plague broke out.

255
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:30,600
A witch doctor

256
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,159
cured our strange illness.

257
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:33,200
He said that

258
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,720
there were evil entities
in the mass graves

259
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,159
and told us to stay in.

260
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:39,039
Granny.

261
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,000
Rest assured.

262
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:41,879
We're going to sleep now.

263
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,320
We won't go out.

264
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,679
I'll check.

265
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,080
Come on.

266
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:06,639
Come on.

267
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,679
One, two, three.

268
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:22,919
So unlucky.

269
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,360
This remote village

270
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,440
has no worthwhile plunder.

271
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,279
Paupers.

272
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:27,360
Stop complaining.

273
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,000
Keep working.

274
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,200
Li Ya'er's Phantom Slash

275
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,639
lives up to its reputation.

276
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,200
I underestimated him.

277
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:44,480
I should have killed him back then.

278
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:46,480
What's your plan?

279
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:49,159
Things are almost ready in Youzhou.

280
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,799
Just a little more time.

281
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:52,879
The Tiance Army might be onto me.

282
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:54,919
What else can I do for you?

283
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:56,039
In that case,

284
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,639
it's time to let them find some clues.
