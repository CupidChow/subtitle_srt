00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,319
What's wrong?

3
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,640
I never noticed before

4
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:34,120
that your hair has turned so gray.

5
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:37,319
When people grow old,

6
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:38,640
gray hairs come naturally.

7
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,599
No need to be sentimental.

8
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,959
I've failed you.

9
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:44,319
Everything's settled.

10
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:45,239
It's all over now.

11
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:47,040
What's your next plan?

12
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:48,400
Eunuch Zhongyi is dead,

13
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,400
but the court

14
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:51,239
remains at odds with Youzhou.

15
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,920
I won't drag Ling into this.

16
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,439
I want to take her

17
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,079
to live somewhere peaceful.

18
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:57,799
Father,

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,959
are you disappointed?

20
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,319
You've all grown up,

21
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:05,599
and I've grown old.

22
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,120
I once

23
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,319
wanted to conquer the world for you.

24
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:12,319
But since you've made your choice,

25
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,439
then follow your heart.

26
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,759
Just don't repeat

27
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:19,120
the path your mother and I took.

28
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,479
Thank you, Father.

29
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,919
That day outside your door,

30
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:25,000
I heard you say

31
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,520
the princess is pregnant.

32
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,439
Is this true?

33
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:30,599
Father,

34
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,240
we said that

35
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,520
just to

36
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:35,360
force you to take action.

37
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:38,240
Actually,

38
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:40,240
you two are perfectly matched.

39
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,240
Don't keep me waiting too long.

40
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:45,280
Father,

41
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:47,120
when did you

42
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,719
approve of Ling and me?

43
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,439
When you risked everything

44
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:54,400
to save her.

45
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,520
Father,

46
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,879
I was terrified by your rage that night.

47
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,064
I...

48
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,319
I really thought you'd truly kill Ling.

49
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:06,080
That day I sealed your acupoints,

50
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,199
yet you broke through to save her.

51
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:09,280
You did

52
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,879
what I failed to do.

53
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:13,479
What's it?

54
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,879
Your mother insisted

55
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,240
on using the Jinlouzi's treasure

56
00:03:18,655 --> 00:03:20,400
to aid the Noble Consort
and former Emperor.

57
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:22,080
I served the new emperor

58
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:23,400
and strongly opposed her.

59
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:25,919
If I possessed

60
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,120
your courage and resolve then,

61
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:29,719
perhaps your mother

62
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:32,439
would still be alive.

63
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,159
Father,

64
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:38,800
don't dwell on the past.

65
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,439
Mother would never blame you.

66
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,439
Who knows?

67
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,960
I'm old now.

68
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:46,319
Soon enough,

69
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:48,080
I'll ask her myself.

70
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,120
Father, you...

71
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:51,400
Alright.

72
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:52,919
No need to comfort me.

73
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:53,840
I'm fine.

74
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,199
Go now.

75
00:04:15,968 --> 00:04:17,360
(Governor's Mansion)
Ling, rest assured.

76
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,920
Shadow Guards'd protect your sister.

77
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,920
Can you stay?

78
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:24,879
Xuanzhi got poisoned

79
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:25,759
because of me.

80
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:28,240
I must resolve this in Shendu.

81
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,959
Then I'll go with you.

82
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,360
What's wrong?

83
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,040
You seem

84
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,839
so worried.

85
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,759
Nothing.

86
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,560
Too many things have happened recently.

87
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:44,040
I'm always restless.

88
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,600
Don't worry.

89
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:49,839
Only when you stay in Youzhou

90
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:51,199
can I feel at ease.

91
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,399
Remember.

92
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,439
No matter what happens,

93
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,480
I'll return to you.

94
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,279
Okay.

95
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,199
Master.

96
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:19,480
Master.

97
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:21,759
Mr. Ya'er.

98
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,800
Father ate nothing?

99
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,800
Yes, it's been a day now.

100
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,240
Master doesn't let anyone in.

101
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:30,079
When I brought the food this morning,

102
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,800
I heard someone singing inside.

103
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:33,560
Master said to put it outside the door.

104
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,240
When I came at noon,

105
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,079
I found the meal remained untouched.

106
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:38,639
I'll do it.

107
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:49,639
Father.

108
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:51,399
I've brought your meal.

109
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,839
Father!

110
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:42,120
Ling.

111
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,120
Xuanzhi.

112
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:45,160
You're awake.

113
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,519
Feeling better?

114
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:51,360
Where are we?

115
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,960
The poison kept you under for five days.

116
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:55,879
We're now returning to Shendu.

117
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,399
Returning to Shendu?

118
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,680
You're not marrying Li Ya'er?

119
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:02,759
Your health comes first.

120
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,920
We'll discuss it later.

121
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,120
What if I never recover?

122
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:09,319
Nonsense!

123
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,279
I will definitely cure you.

124
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:14,759
I'm happy to see you

125
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:17,560
when I open my eyes.

126
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,600
You will be happy every day from now on.

127
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,040
You'll live to be a hundred.

128
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:23,879
Are you hungry?

129
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,240
Let me get you some food.

130
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:27,199
Don't go.

131
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:32,839
Xuanzhi.

132
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,680
Xuanzhi.

133
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:34,920
Are you okay?

134
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,240
Stop!

135
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,360

137
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,040
Mr. Zhang.

138
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:58,319
How is he?

139
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,160
The poison has spread.

140
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,360
There's no way to save him.

141
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:02,759
Impossible.

142
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:03,720
Impossible.

143
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,399
Before,

144
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,319
he showed signs of improvement.

145
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,199
Her Highness's blood
might've temporarily

146
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,439
alleviated the symptoms,

147
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:11,720
but it didn't detoxify.

148
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:14,319
He might not survive
the journey to Shendu.

149
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:18,480
W-What should we do now?

150
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,600
He requested fresh air.

151
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,040
You two can carry him down

152
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,480
and keep him company.

153
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,799

After I die,

156
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:53,039
don't grieve.

Okay.

I'll smile for you every day.

161
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,480
Don't build me a tombstone.
