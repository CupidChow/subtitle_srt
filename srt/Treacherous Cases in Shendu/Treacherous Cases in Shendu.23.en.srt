1
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,560
Lady Zhao.

2
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,719
You finally woke up.

3
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:47,200
Why did you do this to yourself?

4
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,399
Why did you save me?

5
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:50,600
Where is Xuanzhi?

6
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,119
He's over there.

7
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:12,200
Xuanzhi.

8
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,640
Are you a ghost?

9
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:14,959
Please don't scare me.

10
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,200
I think I'm human.

11
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:38,656
=Treacherous Cases in Shendu=
=Episode 23=

12
00:01:43,296 --> 00:01:47,904
(Governor's Mansion)

13
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:54,079
Madam, General,

14
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,200
the autopsy of Lord Wuwei is complete.

15
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:56,959
Go ahead.

16
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,400
Lord Wuwei

17
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,480
indeed died from

18
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,680
exhaustion of vital energy.

19
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,640
What do you have to say?

20
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:08,479
General, I haven't finished.

21
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:09,639
Go on.

22
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:12,360
Though Lord Wuwei died of exhaustion,

23
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,240
it wasn't due to the fight.

24
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,639
It was liver disease.

25
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:16,840
Nonsense!

26
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,368
My examination shows

27
00:02:18,368 --> 00:02:20,448
that his liver was riddled with tumors

28
00:02:20,448 --> 00:02:22,208
that had developed long ago.

29
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:23,616
Based on my experience,

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,919
such patients

31
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:27,599
usually perish within six months.

32
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,199
He did consult physicians
half a year ago.

33
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,840
Then he started acting weird.

34
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:38,599
Six months ago.

35
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,280
That's why he sent me

36
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,240
to investigate Jinlouzi in Shendu.

37
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,639
Now I get it.

38
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,280
Knowing his time was limited,

39
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:50,199
he took the risk.

40
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:53,080
What else?

41
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,479
This is

42
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:57,400
found in Lord Wuwei's
mouth, nose, and stomach.

43
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:00,639
This is...

44
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,080
Opium paste.

45
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,400
It's made from Opium extract.

46
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:04,560
It has strong analgesic

47
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,960
and hallucinogenic effects.

48
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,240
It seems that Lord Wuwei

49
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,520
used it chronically for pain relief.

50
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:12,879
Indeed,

51
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:15,280
I had noticed a pungent odor

52
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,159
in Father's chamber.

53
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,719
He scolded me once,

54
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:19,719
so I never went again.

55
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,599
I thought Father looked pale

56
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,120
because of the old injuries.

57
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,759
What about his severed head?

58
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,680
The decapitation occurred post-mortem,

59
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:33,000
inflicted by a sharp blade.

60
00:03:36,896 --> 00:03:41,400
(Governor's Mansion)

61
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,304
Stop! Who are you?

62
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:51,879
One more step

63
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:52,960
and you're dead.

64
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,479
Let's go.

65
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:20,079
These are Eunuch Zhongyi's clothes.

66
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:21,439
That's right.

67
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,600
Isn't he dead?

68
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:29,360
The puppet master.

69
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:30,920
He's still alive.

70
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,279
I see.

71
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,240
The puppet master

72
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,560
severed Father's head
with wires to create chaos.

73
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,360
Then he made the puppets

74
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:45,959
smuggle Thunderclap Fire from the tomb.

75
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,240
The venomous bugs

76
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,519
kill living beings,

77
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,600
not the puppets.

78
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,959
They're smuggling the explosives out.

79
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:55,720
Lin.

80
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:56,920
Close the city gates.

81
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,319
Unbelievable.

82
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:13,279
Mr. Guo was clearly dead.

83
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:14,519
Mr. Zhang,

84
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,079
pinch him for me.

85
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:17,680
See if he feels pain.

86
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:23,240
Panpan.

87
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,040
Ghosts can't linger

88
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,079
in broad daylight.

89
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:28,079
I could die with you,

90
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,040
but I'd prefer not to be haunted

91
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,240
by your spirit.

92
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,319
It's different.

93
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:35,959
Yeah.

94
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:37,839
Zhao Panpan.

95
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:39,399
I am a ghost,

96
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:41,759
here to claim you.

97
00:05:45,231 --> 00:05:52,416
♪Through mountains cold,

98
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:59,340

100
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,639
Silly girl.

101
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:12,839
I know you're happy for me.

102
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,519
I'm alive.

103
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,480
What was that?

104
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,439
Xuanzhi.

105
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:22,319
I'm so happy that you're alive.

106
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,839
I'm so happy.

107
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,160
Silly girl.

108
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,199
Mr. Zhang.

109
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,519
How did it happen?

110
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,720
Someone must've given you the antidote.

111
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,680
The antidote took effect, which made

112
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,399
you vomit blood and expel the toxin.

113
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,519
While your pulse was stopped,

114
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:46,759
the antidote neutralized the toxin.

115
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:51,120
Who came to see me before we left?

116
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,600
The night before departure,

117
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,439
Qingqing visited your chamber

118
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:56,720
and tended to you.

119
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:09,800
Panpan.

120
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:12,199
How's Xuanzhi?

121
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:14,759
The same.

122
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,199
Still unconscious.

123
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:25,360
Qingqing.

124
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:27,199
Please watch over him for me.

125
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,839
I'll check on the medicine.

126
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,160
Let's go back.

127
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:00,399
Now.

128
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:11,160
Ya'er.

129
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:11,800
Ling.

130
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:12,879
Are you alright?

131
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:14,079
I'm fine.

132
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,319
But the Thunderclap Fire is all gone.

133
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:19,279
A classic diversion tactic.

134
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:21,560
The puppets can't get

135
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,279
so much Thunderclap Fire out.

136
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,759
It's still in the city.

137
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:25,759
Yeah.

138
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,439
All city gates are closed.

139
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,079
The puppet master can't get out.

140
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:31,000
Right,

141
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,480
how's my sister doing?

142
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,039
She was resting

143
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,399
at the governor's mansion.

144
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,639
Since I got locked up,

145
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,200
I haven't heard from her.

146
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,039
Qingqing.

147
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:45,240
Qingqing.

148
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,559
Why isn't she here?

149
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:49,279
Ling.

150
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,080
Ling.

151
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,600
Qingqing.

152
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:53,759
Ling.

153
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,039
Why did you come back?

154
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:56,600
How did you

155
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,639
manage these days?

156
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,600
I woke up only to find

157
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,600
the whole mansion in chaos.

158
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:05,960
Didn't you take Xuanzhi back to Shendu?

159
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,360
Why are you back?

160
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,360
Ling returned to save me.

161
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:10,360
His father is dead.

162
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,720
His two brothers framed him

163
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,120
and almost got him killed.

164
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:17,559
So much has happened,

165
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:20,320
but I knew nothing of it.

166
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:22,440
There's one more thing.

167
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:25,600
On the way back to Shendu,

168
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,440
Xuanzhi died from

169
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:28,679
the poison.

170
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,600
This is all my fault.

171
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,360
Young Master,
puppets spotted at the city gates.

172
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,559
Ling,

173
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:43,559
look after her.

174
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:44,320
I have to go.

175
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:46,120
That puppet master is cunning.

176
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,000
Be very careful.

177
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:48,480
Let's go.

178
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:55,480
Ling.

179
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,559
Do you love Li Ya'er so deeply

180
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,159
that you risked your life for him?

181
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,919
Now it's not just me

182
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:04,960
who loves Li Ya'er.

183
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:08,159
You...

184
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,039
You...

185
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,000
Qingqing,

186
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:12,720
I'm pregnant.

187
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,600
Who is there?

188
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,279
Greetings, Commander.

189
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:37,720
What's in the carriage?

190
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:40,320
These are Princess Changle's
wedding dowries.

191
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,504
With the wedding canceled,

192
00:10:41,504 --> 00:10:43,628
Princess Qingping told us
to get these back to Shendu.

193
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,519
Xuanzhi.

194
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:54,799
What are these?

195
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,480
Jinlouzi's Thunderclap Fire.

196
00:10:58,639 --> 00:10:59,320
Why would these

197
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,960
be in our convoy?

198
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:09,120
Qingqing.

199
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,559
She works for Jinlouzi.

200
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,080
What?

201
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,440
Ling.

202
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,080
Qingqing.

203
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,679
Are you feeling better?

204
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:25,320
Minor injuries.

205
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,399
Nothing serious.

206
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,399
When Eunuch Zhongyi

207
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:28,600
brought you out,

208
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:29,639
I was terrified.

209
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:31,440
Ling,

210
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:33,240
I got you into trouble.

211
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:35,799
We're sisters.

212
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,159
Don't say that.

213
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,679
I don't think

214
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,639
we should stay in Youzhou.

215
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:44,159
The army besieged the city.

216
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,120
Let's hurry up and leave.

217
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,519
You haven't left the mansion for days.

218
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,919
How did you know about

219
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:56,240
the city siege?

220
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,320
Also, you asked me

221
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,679
to steal the military token,

222
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:10,440
but you never asked for it.

223
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:13,000
But I descended into the tomb.

224
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,600
And that very token

225
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,639
was the key to the treasure chest.

226
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:21,679
Qingqing,

227
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:23,399
you...
