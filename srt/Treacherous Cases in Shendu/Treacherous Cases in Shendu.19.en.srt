1
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:43,119
Is it safe to talk here?

2
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,119
Rest assured.

3
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,000
It's safe here.

4
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,719
I heard

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,439
Panpan and Xuanzhi
are spies from the court.

6
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:54,479
That's a long story.

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,600
However,

8
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,759
neither of them

9
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:58,079
has done anything to betray us.

10
00:00:58,479 --> 00:00:59,359
That's good.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,719
What do you want to tell me?

12
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:10,760
We're sisters by blood.

13
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,000
Why be hesitant to talk?

14
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:12,680
Tell me.

15
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:13,799
Actually,

16
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:15,480
the Emperor

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,959
asked me to come

18
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,959
to steal the military token of Youzhou.

19
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,120
What?

20
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,319
This...

21
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,719
Mother was supposed to come,

22
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,079
but got detained by the Emperor.

23
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:33,079
Why would he want it?

24
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,840
Youzhou's army follows commanders,

25
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,000
not the token.

26
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:38,439
I don't know.

27
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,319
The Emperor just asked me to steal it.

28
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,760
Don't worry.

29
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,879
I think Li Ya'er has the token.

30
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:49,239
I'll find a way.

31
00:01:54,963 --> 00:02:00,352
=Treacherous Cases in Shendu=

32
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,439
Ling.

33
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:04,200
What's wrong?

34
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,400
There's something I want to discuss.

35
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:11,919
Go ahead.

36
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,479
I need your Youzhou military token.

37
00:02:23,002 --> 00:02:26,912
(Youzhou)

38
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,680
You're just giving it to me?

39
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,680
Even without asking why?

40
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,280
That day, you entrusted me

41
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,560
with the Jinlouzi painting.

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,039
Today, I trust you

43
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,479
would use it wisely.

44
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,280
Thank you.

45
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,439

Got it.

66
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,720
Lord Wuwei, congratulations

67
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,480
for your marriage.

68
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:46,360
Thank you, my lord.

69
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:53,759
Where is

70
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:58,000
your third son Li Ya'er?

71
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,360
The Qidan people launched
a surprise attack days ago.

72
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,600
Li Ya'er led troops to suppress them

73
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,839
and achieved victory.

74
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:07,920
He'll pay respects to you later.

75
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,879
When Li Ya'er was in Shendu,

76
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:16,160
I failed to take care of him.

77
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,319
There might be

78
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,720
some misunderstanding.

79
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,759
Don't worry, my lord.

80
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,000
He's always been eccentric.

81
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,439
If he does anything improper,

82
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:34,319
please forgive him.

83
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:38,480
Please.

84
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,800
Ling.

85
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,360
You look radiant tonight.

86
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:09,199
Li Ya'er.

87
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,480
Don't hate me.

88
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:14,079
I have reasons I can't tell you.

89
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:17,120
What was that night then?

90
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,560
A reward?

91
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:22,439
Or farewell?

92
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:24,079
Whatever.

93
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,120
From tomorrow on,

94
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,439
I'll be your stepmother.

95
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:37,759
You can only be my wife.

96
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:52,000
Master,

97
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,079

What are you doing?

105
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,160
The Jinlouzi treasure

106
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,439
exists as burial offerings

107
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,959
across twelve tombs.

108
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:57,720
Without uniting all Jinlouzi members,

109
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,720
one couldn't retrieve them all.

110
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,439
(Treasure Map)

111
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:01,319
Back then, your father

112
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:03,000
somehow managed

113
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,639
to locate the treasure in Youzhou.

114
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,879
It should've been guarded

115
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,360
by Yang Chan.

116
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,720
Now it's hidden beneath my crypt.

117
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,279
I'm not one of Jinlouzi.

118
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:14,480
Why capture me?

119
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,279
You know the secret

120
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:20,120
of this Jinlouzi treasure map.

121
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,839
It's made with unique materials.

122
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:24,759
It displays the map
when exposed to fire.

123
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:26,360
However,

124
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:29,439
all these are just deceptive tricks.

125
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,480
To truly discover the map within,

126
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,080
one needs to collect blood

127
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,120
from twelve descendants of Jinlouzi

128
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,080
and infuse it into this painting.

129
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,000
The most crucial element

130
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:45,080
is the blood of the Wu family.

131
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:50,320
You had Li Ya'er

132
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,720
enter Shendu to propose marriage,

133
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:53,840
just to lure out
the other Jinlouzi members?

134
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,600
Correct.

135
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,480
Only when this painting

136
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,679
and a Wu family woman appear together

137
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:02,279
can I lure out all the members

138
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:04,000
(Treasure Map)
of Jinlouzi.

139
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,080
The map to the treasure

140
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:43,080
is hidden

141
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,360
in these twelve fragments.

142
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,039
My lord,

143
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,559
stop being an onlooker.

144
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:07,440
As long as you abide by the agreement,

145
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,960
this secret edict

146
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,360
that claims to never
go against vassal kings

147
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,279
will be proclaimed

148
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:15,279
to the nation tomorrow.

149
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,416
You!

150
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,440
Don't look at me.

151
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:23,600
Isn't Mr. Guo

152
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:24,759
your man?

153
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,840
Guo Xuanzhi.

154
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:30,679
What are you doing?

155
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,799
Are you attempting a rebellion?

156
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,759
You incited unrest,

157
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:36,879
privately sought Jinlouzi's treasure,

158
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,480
deceived the Emperor,

159
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,559
and forged imperial edicts.

160
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:41,679
Who is rebelling exactly?

161
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:43,840
Guo Xuanzhi.

162
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:45,000
It seems

163
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,039
you've found a better master

164
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,000
and are now against me?

165
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,039
The Guo family

166
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,320
has generations of loyalty

167
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,320
to the emperor.

168
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,600
You are so greedy,

169
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,080
even defying the emperor.

170
00:10:58,799 --> 00:10:59,759
You shall be punished.

171
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,559
Want to punish me?

172
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,559
Then prove you have the capability.

173
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:06,519
Do you think

174
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,559
I'd be here without any backup plan?

175
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:14,879
