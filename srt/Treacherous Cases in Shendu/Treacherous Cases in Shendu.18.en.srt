1
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,520
Why did you accept the marriage?

2
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:41,399
I didn't.

3
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:43,880
I had no choice.

4
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,320
Besides...

5
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,359
"Besides" what?

6
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,840
I trust Li Ya'er.

7
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,200
That's straightforward.

8
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,384
So many disputes and troubles

9
00:00:56,384 --> 00:00:57,560
stem from misunderstandings.

10
00:00:58,479 --> 00:00:59,679
I've come to Youzhou

11
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,560
to solve problems,

12
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:03,479
not create new ones.

13
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,000
Solve problems?

14
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:12,680
You're the problem.

15
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:13,680
What should we do?

16
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,400
Please enlighten me.

17
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,159
Li Ya'er

18
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,799
defied my wishes

19
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:19,400
and ruined my decades of planning.

20
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:21,640
That's how you see it?

21
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,680
How else should I see it?

22
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,560
Li Ya'er didn't do all this

23
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:28,319
for me.

24
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:30,480
He did it to save

25
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,120
his beloved father.

26
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,920
I don't need his salvation.

27
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,799
Tang needs my salvation.

28
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:37,159
Tang can only save itself

29
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,439
or perish.

30
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:40,719
What's the point of gaining power?

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,120
Can you take it

32
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,200
to your grave?

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,480
If you were to die now,

34
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:51,799
any final words?

35
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,719
If you were to die now,

36
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:56,079
any final words?

37
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,280
You're the one who wanted to kill me?

38
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,400
If I want to kill you,

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,920
you won't survive.

40
00:02:07,424 --> 00:02:12,864
=Treacherous Cases in Shendu=
=Episode 18=

41
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:15,120
Ling.

42
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:17,919
Ling.

43
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:25,120
Ling.

44
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:26,120
You're fine.

45
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,240
Thank goodness.

46
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,120
Thank goodness.

47
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,240
Ya'er, you woke up.

48
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:48,360
How do you feel, Ya'er?

49
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:50,840
I feel awful.

50
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:51,759
My head hurts.

51
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,240
Terrible headache.

52
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:55,960
Ling.

53
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,520
Come check on me.

54
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,759
A fake innocent is the toughest.

55
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,039
Even a stab

56
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,039
couldn't kill him.

57
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,759
The master of sarcasm
is quite impressive,

58
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:07,479
skilled in medicine,

59
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,560
and even sharper with words.

60
00:03:10,432 --> 00:03:11,639
I shouldn't have treated you.

61
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:13,240
Xuanzhi.

62
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:14,319
He just woke up

63
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:15,520
and is still dazed.

64
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,759
Don't be mad.

65
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,280
Who wants your treatment?

66
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:19,879
Ling is the cure for me.

67
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,159
Enough.

68
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,960
What exactly happened last night?

69
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,960
You're the one who wanted to kill me?

70
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:31,520
If I want to kill you,

71
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,319
you won't survive.

72
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,759
I know.

73
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:38,199
May I ask some questions?

74
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:39,840
Ask away.

75
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:41,479
Did you

76
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,400
kill my father

77
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:44,919
for Jinlouzi's treasure?

78
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,159
If I tell you

79
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,680
that your father

80
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:54,280
begged me to kill him,

81
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:55,919
would you believe it?

82
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,680
Li Ya'er's mother Yang Chan

83
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:00,879
was my junior sister from the sect.

84
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,039
During the coup,

85
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,919
the Wu family lost power.

86
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,639
Your grandfather sent your father

87
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,879
to the mountains to avoid persecution.

88
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,639
The three of us were close.

89
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,840
We spent ten years together there.

90
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:14,759
One day,

91
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,560
your grandfather came

92
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,240
and took your father home.

93
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,879
Yang Chan cried her heart out.

94
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,079
And I realized

95
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:23,240
that she was

96
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,120
into your father.

97
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:29,680
I was older

98
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,000
than them

99
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:32,639
and more rigid.

100
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:34,000
Your father

101
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,000
and Yang Chan

102
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:36,600
were around the same age.

103
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,439
And he was outgoing.

104
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,560
Naturally, he was
more popular among girls.

105
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,839
One day, Yang Chan left to look for

106
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,480
your father.

107
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:48,000
I searched everywhere,

108
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,439
and finally found them in Chang'an.

109
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:52,160
By that time,

110
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:56,399
they had secretly established Jinlouzi.

111
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,800
The treasure

112
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,199
was meant to restore the previous reign.

113
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,680
We can't fund the Li family's regime.

114
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:05,240
If Tang falls,

115
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:08,120
it's even harder
to restore the previous reign.

116
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,360
Things have changed.

117
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:11,800
Preserving Tang

118
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,959
is the key.

119
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:18,120
Your Highness.

120
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,000
He's here.

121
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,600
I, Wu Zhongheng, pay my respects to you.

122
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:24,040
I heard

123
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,079
you used Jinlouzi's treasure.

124
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:29,279
Your Highness,

125
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,720
His Majesty followed
the Noble Consort's advice

126
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,000
to utilize the treasure

127
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,600
against the barbarians.

128
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,879
When did your Jinlouzi agents

129
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:39,120
start serving the Yang family?

130
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:43,360
My father would never

131
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:44,759
betray his master.

132
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:49,240
Then how did you find the treasure?

133
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,319
Your father

134
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:51,879
gave me the treasure.

135
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:53,160
Do you believe me?

136
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:55,040
Your father,

137
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:56,279
like Yang Chan,

138
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,439
supported the new ruler
against Jinlouzi.

139
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:01,040
They went down the mountain

140
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,040
to find the treasure and got poisoned.

141
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:05,000
The poison would flare up

142
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:07,240
every afternoon after they returned,

143
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,639
causing unbearable

144
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,720
pain and itching.

145
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:12,199
The new ruler

146
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:14,519
urged me to persuade your father.

147
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:17,079
But he'd rather die than support

148
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:18,680
the new ruler's rebellion,

149
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,360
and was confined in camp.

150
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,079
The poison took effect.

151
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,720
He knew his time was limited

152
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,480
and made me swear

153
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,680
to use the treasure against rebels.

154
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,000
He begged me

155
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:30,639
to end his suffering.

156
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:38,439
My lord.

157
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:40,920
Are you alright?

158
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:43,399
I'm fine.

159
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:48,800
Let's call it a day.

160
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:03,600
Li Huaixian beat his own son,

161
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,600
and then told stories
to his new wife at midnight?

162
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:10,199
Your family is quite interesting.

163
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,319
My father told you

164
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:18,399
that my mother was also poisoned?

165
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,639
Yes.

166
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,279
My mother took medicine constantly

167
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:29,600
and feared sunlight intensely.

168
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,319
It matches

169
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,000
the symptoms.

170
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:35,240
What poison could be this potent?

171
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,120
It's the price for seeking the treasure.

172
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:43,399
I'm glad you're fine.

173
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:44,560
He stormed out,

174
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:46,720
threatening to kill you.

175
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,879
I was terrified.

176
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,240
I was frightened, too.

177
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:51,839
Then, his tone softened a lot.

178
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,720
But he didn't

179
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,680
look so well.

180
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:57,319
Shouldn't you check on him?

181
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:00,680
My father has suffered

182
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,519
many injuries.

183
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,199
The pain recurs

184
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:05,519
quite often.

185
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,519
He knows your relationship.

186
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,360
And he beat you up,

187
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:10,759
but let Ling go.

188
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,839
What is he really up to?

189
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,279
Since we've come this far,

190
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,240
we must keep moving forward

191
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:21,160
until everything gets resolved.

192
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,920
- Father.
- Beans are boiled

193
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,679
with beanstalks burning.

194
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,399
I'm coming in.

195
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:40,919
A sound of weeping
came from the caldron.

196
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:49,720
We came from the same root.

197
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:58,080
Why should we burn each other?

198
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:03,879
Who allowed you to enter?

199
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,279
Forgive me, Father.

200
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,639
Anything else to say?

201
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:14,240
The envoy said

202
00:09:15,584 --> 00:09:17,760
that they'll send representatives
to your wedding.

203
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,480
Alright.

204
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,240
I see.

205
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,120
Leave.

206
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:24,200
Understood.

207
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:49,200
Ya'er.

208
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:06,080
I went to see my father.

209
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:09,720
He was acting weird.

210
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,960
What do you mean?

211
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:13,480
It's hard to explain.

212
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,200
I've also noticed

213
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:18,000
something strange about him.

214
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,639
Is it possible that

215
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,200
your father is playing along?

216
00:10:26,656 --> 00:10:30,848
(Governor's Mansion)

217
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,759
Qingqing.

218
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:50,399
Qingqing.

219
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:51,720
Xuanzhi.

220
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,000
Panpan.

221
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,440
Silly girl.

222
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,919
Why are you crying?

223
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:03,399
When I left Shendu,

224
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:05,279
you were still unconscious.

225
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,080
Now you're standing in front of me.

226
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:10,200
How could I hold back my tears?

227
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,720
It's been a long trip.

228
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,799
Let's talk inside.

229
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:14,519
Yeah.

230
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:15,399
