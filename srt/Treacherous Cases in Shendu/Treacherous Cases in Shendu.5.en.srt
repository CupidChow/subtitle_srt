1
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,320
Who are you?

2
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I am Wu Ya'er.

3
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:07,680
No.

4
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,640
You're my mortal enemy,

5
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,239
Li Ya'er.

6
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:29,408
=Treacherous Cases in Shendu=
=Episode 5=

7
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:41,040
Panpan.

8
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,239
Go have some food.

9
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,840
Xuanzhi hasn't returned yet.

10
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,640
I can't eat.

11
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,719
Aren't you worried?

12
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:50,680
Given their martial skills and agility,

13
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,480
they'll be fine.

14
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:52,439
Just go back.

15
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:54,480
Makes sense.

16
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,319
Then I should eat something.

17
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,840
Ling.

18
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:05,400
A word in private.

19
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:12,599
Did you capture them?

20
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,919
They are highly skilled.

21
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:17,919
How could I subdue them?

22
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,680
Mr. Guo simply drank too much,

23
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:23,000
and Mr. Wu is looking after him.

24
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:28,000
That day you asked
if I knew about Jinlouzi.

25
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:29,520
I do know.

26
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,039
How?

27
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:34,479
Several months ago,

28
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,280
a man came to Zuixian Tower.

29
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:39,599
He spent lavishly.

30
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,048
After drinking the Immortal's Ecstasy,

31
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,199
he revealed information.

32
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:44,680
That's how I learned

33
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,520
he was Di Long,
one of the Jinlouzi members.

34
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,360
To uncover the other Jinlouzi members,

35
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,400
I made him talk

36
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:55,879
and bribed him
to join the wedding entourage

37
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:58,680
to gather intelligence
about the Jinlouzi.

38
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,080
Unexpectedly,

39
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,199
he betrayed us.

40
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:03,800
You mean

41
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,639
Zhou Mi, Judicial Minister?

42
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:07,520
Yes.

43
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,159
Then why did he tell you

44
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:12,199
his true identity?

45
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,039
Immortal's Ecstasy

46
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:16,879
is a potent hallucinogenic drug.

47
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,256
It strips away all mental defenses.

48
00:03:20,544 --> 00:03:21,719
Victims answer any question.

49
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,520
But it doesn't kill.

50
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,560
How did Zhang Liang die?

51
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,759
Mrs. Zhang

52
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,368
failed to bear a son,

53
00:03:30,368 --> 00:03:31,599
and got beaten by Zhang Liang.

54
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:33,319
Zhang Liang

55
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:34,800
frequented brothels,

56
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:37,039
breaking Mrs. Zhang's heart.

57
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:39,360
That day,

58
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:40,719
she came to me.

59
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:48,240
Please.

60
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:49,960
Help me.

61
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,639
Make my husband return to me.

62
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,800
Otherwise, I can't go on living.

63
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,000
What can I do to help you?

64
00:03:59,039 --> 00:03:59,639
I heard

65
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,360
your Immortal's Ecstasy

66
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,919
can capture a man's heart.

67
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:05,199
I want...

68
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,199
Here's Mrs. Zhang's letter

69
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:12,919
requesting our meeting.

70
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:16,199
It details Zhang Liang's abuse.

71
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:19,800
(Keep my husband with the Immortal's Ecstasy)
I met her out of pity.

72
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:23,720
I gave her Immortal's Ecstasy

73
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,399
to help,

74
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,800
but Mrs. Zhang overdosed her husband

75
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,199
with Immortal's Ecstasy.

76
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,160
Zhang Liang's too weak

77
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,839
to handle it,

78
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,480
and died suddenly.

79
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:43,839
So you used the mural trick

80
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,399
to cover for Mrs. Zhang,

81
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,560
making everyone
present that night believe

82
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:49,920
Zhang Liang

83
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:51,879
died at the tavern.

84
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:54,279
Yes.

85
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:57,319
Mrs. Zhang

86
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,399
reminded me of my past.

87
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,680
She's pitiful.

88
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:06,279
She shouldn't die
for Zhang Liang's death.

89
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,360
Moreover,

90
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,199
she has a child.

91
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,519
But

92
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:16,040
the man she met that night...

93
00:05:21,248 --> 00:05:22,680
Male actor as Geisha Hua Yuenu,

94
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:24,519
for the Princess Changle.

95
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:52,600
Wu Ya'er.

96
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,040
Why are you in my bed?

97
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:56,959
Guo Xuanzhi.

98
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,759
Are you even human?

99
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,839
If not for me,

100
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:03,240
you would've been killed.

101
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,360
Hua Yuenu.

102
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:10,279
You have an Adam's apple?

103
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:13,680
When you got here,

104
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:15,040
what's my state?

105
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:21,639
Actually, it's my fault.

106
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,720
I came too late.

107
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:24,680
When I got here,

108
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,279
I saw you two...

109
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,199
hugging,

110
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,000
kissing, and groping each other.

111
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,040
Even clothes were off.

112
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:31,808
I...

113
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:32,399
Stop it.

114
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,680
I'll go kill him.

115
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,560
Xuanzhi.

116
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:43,600
You're awake.

117
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:45,199
I made you hangover soup.

118
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,759
Why are you still vomiting?

119
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,839
It's not because of hangover,

120
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,000
but remorse.

121
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:56,279
Wu Ya'er.

122
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,000
Don't gloat over my misery.

123
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:00,639
I told you not to go.

124
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:01,800
Deserve it.

125
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:04,439
Last night,

126
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:05,839
as soon as I got Ling's message,

127
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:06,959
I came to take care of you.

128
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,040
And you?

129
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,040
One was grinning on the bed,

130
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,519
another sobbing on the floor.

131
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,680
What's wrong?

132
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:19,040
You're grinning on the bed,

133
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,560
and Wu Ya'er sobbing on the floor.

134
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,680
Don't you remember anything?

135
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,368
You're both dead weight.

136
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:51,800
I can't drag you anywhere.

137
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:53,639
You can just live here together.

138
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:55,839
Wu Ya'er.

139
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:58,120
Did you do anything to betray Ling?

140
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:01,480
Guo Xuanzhi.

141
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:03,759
Did you have some filthy dream?

142
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,800
Don't let Hua Yuenu down.

143
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,279
Treat him well.

144
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:21,399
Thank you for helping
conceal my identity.

145
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,759
Thank you for resolving my doubts.

146
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,800
Well,

147
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:29,920
why did you help Mrs. Zhang?

148
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:31,879
She turned herself in the yamen,

149
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,360
and received due punishment.

150
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,960
After losing her husband,

151
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:40,240
her living with her child

152
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,360
must be difficult.

153
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:44,159
Since the yamen showed leniency,

154
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,320
why would I pursue further?

155
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:49,159
You're so magnanimous.

156
00:08:58,799 --> 00:08:59,600
Is he...

157
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:09,080
Is he Li Ya'er?

158
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,759
Who do you think he is?

159
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,440
Does my opinion matter?

160
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,600
Can it change anything?

161
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,000
You've changed something.

162
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:24,440
He remembers nothing of his past.

163
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,320
Now you alone occupy his mind.

164
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:29,879
Though occasional troubles arise,

165
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,559
I can tell

166
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:32,600
he's content.

167
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:36,759
Li Ya'er's life was filled
with endless darkness,

168
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:37,799
but Wu Ya'er

169
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:39,080
has found light.

170
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:41,200
Henceforth,

171
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:42,360
whoever he becomes

172
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:46,720
depends on you.

173
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,639
I leave this Immortal's Ecstasy
with you.

174
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:54,440
It may prove useful someday.

175
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,799
Farewell.

176
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,480
Have some tea.

177
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:32,840
Ling.

178
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,159
You've figured it out?

179
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,559
Mostly.

180
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:40,840
Well,

181
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:42,279
what did Hua Yuenu

182
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,039
tell you?

183
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:46,159
He gave me Immortal's Ecstasy

184
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,960
and told me

185
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:50,600
his connection with Jinlouzi's Di Long.

186
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,080
He also mentioned

187
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,679
my sister's death

188
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,639
was unexpected to him.

189
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:56,639
Do you

190
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,159
believe all that?

191
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,519
He had no reason to lie.

192
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:02,120
To find the treasure,

193
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,759
they're also seeking Jinlouzi.

194
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,120
My sister's death
brought them no advantage.

195
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:10,480
Alright.

196
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:11,679
Alright.

197
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:13,840
By the way,

198
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,639
he asked me to tell you.

199
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,039
He made you surrender your first kiss.

200
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:23,679
He also praised

201
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,759
your nice figure.

202
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,399
Xuanzhi.

203
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:30,759
I'll go kill him!

204
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:32,000
I'll kill you!

205
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,639
Li Ya'er.

206
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,799
I'm not Li Ya'er.

207
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:53,399
I am Wu Ya'er.

208
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:57,039
Why don't you turn around?

209
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,559
You were calling someone else.

210
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:00,759
Why would I turn around?

211
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:05,600
Try to avoid?

212
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,120
Not at all.

213
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:09,919
I have to

214
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:10,919
keep my promise.

215
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,080
I promise you

216
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,000
to avenge you.

217
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,440
Until then,

218
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,879
this is what I can do.

219
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,200
I won't give up.

220
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:22,200
My lady.

221
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:25,840
If you still see me

222
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:27,919
as your enemy after learning the truth,

223
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:30,360
then kill me.

224
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:39,159
Alright.

225
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:40,759
Understood.

226
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:42,639
Wu Ya'er.

227
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:53,639
Thank you, my lady.

228
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:55,559
My lady.

229
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:01,919
It's your cup.

230
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,490
Looks like your memory is coming back.

231
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,759
What do you want?

232
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:18,879
Whoever you are,

233
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,519
stay away from Ling.

234
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,200
Don't harm her.

235
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:26,879
I've told you

236
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,320
she saved my life

237
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,279
and I would never harm her.

238
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,639
I can tell you care for Ling.

239
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:44,480
She's valued relationships deeply.

240
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,559
After losing her father and sister,

241
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,559
she puts on a brave front

242
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:49,879
but her heart's been shattered.

243
00:13:50,432 --> 00:13:51,512
The more she cares for you,

244
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:53,559
the more it'll destroy her

245
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:55,840
when you recover your memories.

246
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,519
I can remain Wu Ya'er forever.

247
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:01,600
You can't.

248
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,600
Even if you want to,

249
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,000
the forces behind you won't allow it.

250
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:07,000
Moreover,

251
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,120
Hua Yuenu

252
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,559
relates to you, right?

253
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,000
Perhaps you're right.

254
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:23,360
But as long as I remain Wu Ya'er,

255
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,919
I won't let anyone harm Ling.

256
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,600
If my other self comes,

257
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:28,960
I'll kill that version of me.

258
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,919
I'll always be her Wu Ya'er.

259
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,480
Forever.
