1
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,439
(His Majesty decrees.)

2
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,799
(Princess Wu Qingqing)

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,520
(was born of noble lineage)

4
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,079
(Wu Qingqing, Princess Qingping)
(with virtues)

5
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,799
(much to my delight.)

6
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,640
(She shall be titled Princess Qingping)

7
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,039
(to wed the Governor of Youzhou,
Li Huaixian.)

8
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,119
(May their union endure for centuries,)

9
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,320
(and their lineage
thrive for generations.)

10
00:01:14,656 --> 00:01:15,552
Yah!

11
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,560
What's going on?

12
00:01:52,627 --> 00:01:58,144
=Treacherous Cases in Shendu=
=Episode 1=

13
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,599
Stay out of the wedding procession.

14
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:02,799
Your lives will be forfeit

15
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,079
if you delay us.

16
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,080
(Li Ya'er, Governor of Youzhou's son)
You shall perish!

17
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,280
Attack!

18
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:25,840
Kill him!

19
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,439
Who are you?

20
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,080
I was merely passing by

21
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:54,400
and lost my way.

22
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,039
You saw me killing them.

23
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:57,360
Do you think

24
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,840
I'd let you go?

25
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,159
Please spare me.

26
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:08,800
I'll do anything you ask.

27
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,120
This is how you

28
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,360
show affection?

29
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,000
I merely seek to survive.

30
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,280
No other intentions.

31
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,400
The Jinlouzi agents

32
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,000
are resorting to such lowly tactics?

33
00:03:46,528 --> 00:03:47,296
Nothing.

34
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,560
You're not a Jinlouzi.

35
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,800
Who are you?

36
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,520
Your father killed my father

37
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,520
and forced my sister into marriage.

38
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,120
Our feud can only

39
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,000
be settled with your death.

40
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:03,400
Lord Wu's Mansion.

41
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,856
Sister of Princess Qingping.

42
00:04:05,856 --> 00:04:06,944
(Wu Lingling, Princess Changle)

43
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,479
You're under control.

44
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,280
What can you possibly do?

45
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:30,160
What are you doing?

46
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,720
My lips bear
the strongest numbing poison.

47
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,240
I won't kill you.

48
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:36,680
I'll keep you under house arrest.

49
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:38,560
When your father begs mercy,

50
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:41,399
I'll make your entire clan suffer.

51
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,720
You underestimate me too much.

52
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:52,879
I'm no match for you today.

53
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,759
But I'll claim your life one day.

54
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,920
Li Ya'er.

55
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,360
You shall perish!

56
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,639
Ling, where were you last night?

57
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,439
Qingqing must have reached

58
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:08,519
the western outskirts.

59
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:10,000
Let's get her back.

60
00:05:15,392 --> 00:05:15,959
Ling.

61
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:17,600
(Guo Xuanzhi, Tiance Army Commander)
That's her carriage.

62
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,519
Ling.

63
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,639
Ling.

64
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,640
Ling.

65
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:21,792
Ling.

66
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,200
Ling.

67
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:25,024
Ling.

68
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:40,759
Ling.

69
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,000
There you are.

70
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,439
(Ling, help!)

71
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:56,439
Ling.

72
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,839
Xuanzhi.

73
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,439
Ling.

74
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:05,439
Well?

75
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:06,959
Are you alright?

76
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:10,560
X-Xuanzhi.

77
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:13,560
I just

78
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:16,360
had a nightmare.

79
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:19,759
Ling.

80
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:23,279
Qingqing's remains

81
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,639
have been returned.

82
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:30,399
His Majesty sent Eunuch Zhongyi

83
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,000
and vowed to find the killers

84
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:34,839
to do the Wu Clan justice.

85
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:38,560
But he says

86
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,639
no funeral for now

87
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,160
in case some exploits it.

88
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:45,879
No funeral?

89
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:49,160
Blind ruler.

90
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,879
Blind ruler!

91
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:53,360
Ling.

92
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,680
He first killed my father.

93
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:57,439
Now my sister.

94
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,000
Why didn't you marry off

95
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:03,000
your own daughter
to the Youzhou Governor?

96
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:04,519
Ling.

97
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:05,839
Ling.

98
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,680
I know you're mad.

99
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:09,959
But now

100
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,040
is not the time for grief.

101
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,000
Qingqing died mysteriously.

102
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:16,879
We must pull ourselves together

103
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:18,560
and uncover the truth.

104
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,560
The death of Princess Qingping

105
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,040
has created a dire situation.

106
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,320
You're saying...

107
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,399
Li Huaixian

108
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,480
(Eunuch Zhongyi, Military Overseer)
asked to marry

109
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,840
a young maiden

110
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,200
of the Wu clan.

111
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:43,080
His Majesty approved it.

112
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:44,600
At that time,

113
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,440
considering your friendship

114
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:49,919
with Wu Lingling,

115
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,600
I advised His Majesty to send

116
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,039
Wu Qingqing for the marriage.

117
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,519
Now that Wu Qingqing has died,

118
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,960
Wu Lingling

119
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,759
must take her place in the marriage.

120
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:02,879
My lord.

121
00:09:03,552 --> 00:09:04,384
Ling and I

122
00:09:04,518 --> 00:09:05,888
have been engaged since childhood.

123
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:07,879
Please take into account

124
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:08,759
my years of service

125
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:10,480
and beg His Majesty.

126
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
There might be a way out.

127
00:09:20,864 --> 00:09:23,648
(Three days later)

128
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:27,840
This place is chaotic.

129
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,720
There could be clues we need.

130
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,000
Candied hawthorn.

131
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:33,399
Ling.

132
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,320
Let me get you back to rest.

133
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,279
Such relentless investigation

134
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:38,720
will ruin your health.

135
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:41,480
I'm fine.

136
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:45,480
Get him!

137
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,799
Stop!

138
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:49,360
Freeze.

139
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:51,679
Don't let him escape.

140
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,360
Catch him.

141
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,120
You brat.

142
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,120
Get him.

143
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:03,320
Keep running.

144
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:04,399
Why did you stop?

145
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:05,720
Xuanzhi, what's going on?

146
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,600
Beat him to death.

147
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,399
Looks like they caught a slave

148
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:09,799
for sale.

149
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:14,720
Move.

150
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,639
Quite the runner, huh?

151
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,720
I chased you for quite a while.

152
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:25,320
Keep running. Why did you stop?

153
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:32,480
You brat.

154
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,960
Three days ago,

155
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,200
I saved you at the western outskirts

156
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:37,759
to feed you for nothing?

157
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:39,399
(Three days ago.)

158
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:41,039
(Western outskirts.)

159
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,399
(Qingqing died there.)

160
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,360
I'll teach you a proper lesson.

161
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:47,000
Break his legs.

162
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,200
Do it.

163
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,639
Take the money.

164
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,879
He's mine.

165
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:09,600
Why are you dazed?

166
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:10,639
Let's go.

167
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,600
Grab a drink.

168
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,399
Are you okay?

169
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:20,360
Come home with me.

170
00:11:25,203 --> 00:11:27,296
(Lord Wu's Mansion)

171
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,600
Are you fine?

172
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,960
Can you hear me?

173
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,080
Did you see anything

174
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,000
that night

175
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:34,399
at the western outskirts?

176
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,279
Can you remember anything?

177
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:37,879
Ling.

178
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:41,720
It appears

179
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,120
his head injury

180
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,000
caused amnesia.

181
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,559
Give him some time.

182
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:46,799
When Qingqing was killed,

183
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:48,279
he might have seen something.

184
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,759
We must find a way to cure him.

185
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,559
Who are you?

186
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:18,550
Where's the painting?

187
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:19,919
What painting?

188
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,519
I don't understand.

189
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:22,519
Knock it off.

190
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,224
What did you do to Qingqing?

191
00:12:40,224 --> 00:12:41,724
Why are you looking for the painting?

192
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:42,879
Tell me!

193
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:32,759
Hands off me.

194
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:35,600
You're poisoned.

195
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,679
You're not mute.

196

Ling!

201
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:04,600
Xuanzhi.

202
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,279
Ling.

203
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:07,440
Ling.

204
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:09,399
Let go.

205
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:11,399
Where were you?

206
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:12,320
What happened?

207
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,519
You were poisoned?

208
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:15,440
I'm fine now.

209
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:17,080
He sucked it out for me.

210
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:18,200
Sucked?

211
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:22,480
You brat.

212
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:23,720
The Weakening Powder

213
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,679
is nothing lethal.

214
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,639
You've gone too far.

215
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,200
Xuanzhi.

216
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,440
Don't give him a hard time.

217
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,279
Ling.

218
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,279
I bet he is playing dumb.

219
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,879
Let me interrogate him.

220
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,360
Xuanzhi.

221
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,120
After all,

222
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,360
he just saved my life.

223
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:42,919
Never mind.

224
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:52,320
Since you've lost all memory,

225
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,440
stay by my side.

226
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:03,200
My mortal enemy

227
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,320
is Li Ya'er.

228
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:06,240
You must remember his name.

229
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,120
My surname is Wu.

230
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,039
From now on, you'll be

00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,679
