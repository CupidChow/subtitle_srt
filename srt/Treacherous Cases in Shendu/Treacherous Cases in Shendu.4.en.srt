1
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,399
What is it?

2
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:57,439
Doesn't matter if you don't know.

3
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,640
Just a bunch

4
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,799
of petty villains.

5
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,319
Then, sir,

6
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:11,120
any more questions for me?

7
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,799
They say

8
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:15,719
the Immortal's Ecstasy at Zuixian Tower

9
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:16,680
is peerless.

10
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,000
I wonder

11
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,480
if I could taste it.

12
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,680
Since you respect me,

13
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,319
I shouldn't refuse.

14
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,519
But due to Mr. Zhang's incident,

15
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:29,400
the yamen confiscated all our stock.

16
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:30,239
We must

17
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:32,480
wait for the new batch in a few days.

18
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:37,000
Then, I'll pour you a cup.

19
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:52,747
=Treacherous Cases in Shendu=
=Episode 4=

20
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:56,319
My lady,

21
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,000
according to you,

22
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,120
Hua Yuenu must know something.

23
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,760
If she has the Immortal's Ecstasy,

24
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,040
my lady,

25
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:07,079
do you really plan to taste that?

26
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,759
Xuanzhi said

27
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,240
it's not a potent poison.

28
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,599
For my sister,

29
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,639
I would risk it.

30
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:19,919
What's wrong?

31
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:23,960
Let me do it.

32
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,000
I won't let you take risks.

33
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,080
Besides,

34
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,960
I might be your mortal enemy.

35
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,479
Even if I die,

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,159
it doesn't matter.

37
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,680
If you're really Li Ya'er,

38
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,159
that'd be the biggest joke.

39
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:43,400
Why?

40
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,759
Li Ya'er, the Godslayer,

41
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:47,240
is pretending to be pitiful here.

42
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,560
What a joke.

43
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:54,800
My lady,

44
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,439
I'm sincere.

45
00:02:59,199 --> 00:02:59,680
Fine.

46
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,800
If you're sincere,

47
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,520
do me one more favor.

48
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,360
Just say it.

49
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,280
Seduce Hua Yuenu

50
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,472
to get the Immortal's Ecstasy.

51
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,000
But I don't know how to seduce women.

52
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,080
I can teach you.

53
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,840
What about Mrs. Zhang?

54
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:30,759
She panicked home last night

55
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:31,719
and hasn't left since.

56
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,479
I've asked friends at the yamen

57
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,360
to keep a watch.

58
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,919
You even

59
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,159
have connections there?

60
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,000
Money opens doors.

61
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,360
Using my money to open doors.

62
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,439
Don't complain.

63
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,000
If you hadn't messed up,

64
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,560
we wouldn't have this trouble.

65
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:49,240
But that Hua Yuenu

66
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,280
must know something.

67
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:52,120
She's so vigilant.

68
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,319
She didn't give me the wine.

69
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:55,520
I need to find a way.

70
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,879
What is it?

71
00:03:57,719 --> 00:03:58,960
Honey trap.

72
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,000
Honey trap?

73
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,080
I disagree.

74
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:04,800
As an unmarried maiden,

75
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:06,560
I can't visit such a place.

76
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,199
Don't flatter yourself.

77
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,039
Ling means me,

78
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:11,879
not you.

79
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:14,120
Then I disagree even more!

80
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,759
Xuanzhi is pure and simple.

81
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,800
I won't let that courtesan taint him.

82
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,120
This isn't your call.

83
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,279
Moreover,

84
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,439
aside from me,

85
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,519
any other man?

86
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,000
What about Wu Ya'er?

87
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,839
Send him.

88
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:25,639
What?

89
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:26,680
I'm much prettier.

90
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,040
True.

91
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,759
Besides,

92
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,079
no women

93
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:31,319
would like a blockhead.

94
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:32,879
Mr. Guo,

95
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,199
mind your words.

96
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,759
It's fine.

97
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:36,959
Clothes make the man.

98
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:38,439
I'll dress up Wu Ya'er.

99
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,040
Maybe that woman has peculiar tastes.

100
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,639
Mind your words too.

101
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:48,199
Don't waste time.
I could solve it quickly.

102
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,480
Wait for my good news.

103
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:52,519
Wait...

104
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:53,240
Wait.

105
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:53,839
Xuan...

106
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:56,639
I haven't finished.

107
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:23,959
Sir,

108
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,639
Zuixian Tower hasn't reopened yet.

109
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:27,160
Please visit another day.

110
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:30,199
I only wish

111
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:31,839
to meet Miss Hua Yuenu.

112
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,560
I desire nothing more.

113
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:37,800
You...

114
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:44,199
Let me inform her.

115
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,639
Please wait a moment.

116
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:51,439
Look!

117
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,560
He is really handsome.

118
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,160
Exactly.

119
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,480
Truly remarkable.

120
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,199
Sir,

121
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,879
Miss Hua says

122
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:06,240
to play a game with you.

123
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,639
If you pass,

124
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:09,000
you may meet her.

125
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,040
What game?

126
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,288
Drink as much as we offer.

127
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:15,279
Okay.

128
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:17,399
What's Zhao Panpan doing?

129
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,319
Taking so long.

130
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,879
Where's Wu Ya'er?

131
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:51,759
Panpan, impressive.

132
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:52,600
This costume's good.

133
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,480
Of course.

134
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,480
Even I found it great.

135
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:57,519
If I didn't fall for Xuanzhi,

136
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:58,959
I'd be charmed by him.

137
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:04,439
Meeting you and we drink heartily.

138
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:06,879
Tethering horses by willows
by the wine house.

139
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:10,000
What a dashing young man.

140
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,480
Gleams like jade before the wind.

141
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,199
This is stunning,

142
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:14,759
Panpan.

143
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:16,600
You'll surely win over Hua Yuenu.

144
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:18,279
But my lady,

145
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:19,720
I don't know how.

146
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:21,879
I do.

147
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,480
You teach him properly.

148
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,000
Don't let me down.

149
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,639
I'll go to Xuanzhi.

150
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,439
What are you up to?

151
00:07:41,632 --> 00:07:45,133
(Li Bai)

152
00:07:57,376 --> 00:07:58,880
(Li Bai)

153
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,199
- Sir.
- Sir.

154
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,240
You're amazing.

155
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,519
Have a drink.

156
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:16,759
One more cup.

157
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:18,759
Drink mine too.

158
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:21,000
Impressive capacity for liquor.

159
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,800
Truly remarkable.

160
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,800
Sir,

161
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:28,680
you may see Miss Hua now.

162
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,519
Please.

163
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:33,200
I won.

164
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:35,720
Hua Yuenu.

165
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,279
What do you want?

166
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,879
I shall fulfill it.

167
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,480
Bring me your finest wine.

168
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:50,840
Sir,

169
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,039
are you also here
for the Immortal's Ecstasy?

170
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:56,600
Of course.

171
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,480
Ling

172
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,240
sent me to investigate the wine.

173
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:05,120
Ling?

174
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,080
Who is Ling?

175
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,360
Ling...

176
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,120
She is my betrothed.

177
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,519
She's the woman I love most.

178
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:21,759
You're so spoony.

179
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,679
Yet you don't know

180
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:25,799
beauty can be a blade

181
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:28,960
that takes your life.

182
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,320
Why does Ling investigate
the Immortal's Ecstasy?

183
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:33,279
That wine

184
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:34,679
harmed her sister.

185
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,559
I can't bear to see her grieve.

186
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,559
Who is Ling's sister?

187
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:43,080
Her sister

188
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:45,440
is Princess Qingping.

189
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:47,799
I knew it.

190
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:51,320
You fake it?

191
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,000
I'm Shendu Flower Slash.

192
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,840
Such little liquor

193
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,519
couldn't make me drunk.

194
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,519
Are you Jinlouzi?

195
00:10:06,112 --> 00:10:06,656
You...

196
00:10:07,328 --> 00:10:08,399
You have an Adam's apple?

197
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,200
Look at me.

198
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,879
Is it necessary?

199
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:38,039
Rule number one for attracting women.

200
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:40,080
Be confident.

201
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,639
Don't be coward.

202
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:42,960
Understood.

203
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,240
Rule number two for attracting women.

204
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:55,519
Don't show excessive lust.

205
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:56,840
No women like to see

206
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,200
a man leering like that.

207
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,279
Right.

208
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:09,240
Exactly.

209
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,879
With deep affection,

210
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,360
undivided attention,

211
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:13,600
and purity.

212
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,679
You'll surely win over her.

213
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,399
Why?

214
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,240
Hua Yuenu is a dancing courtesan.

215
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,559
She has seen all kinds of men.

216
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,919
Every man desires to possess her.

217
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:25,720
But someone innocent like you

218
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:26,919
could surely win over her.

219
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,919
Hua Yuenu

220
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,159
will offer you wine

221
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:34,960
and say,

222
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,879
"Sir, have a drink."

223
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,919
I can't hold the liquor.

224
00:11:43,392 --> 00:11:44,480
If I drink this,

225
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:45,799
I might lose control

226
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,039
and harm you.

227
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,080
But refusing to drink

228
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,000
might hurt your feelings.

229
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,159
Why not

230
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:55,679
we share this cup?

231
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:14,639
Is that right, my lady?

232
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:17,879
Yes.

233
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,799
Exactly.

234
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:21,720
I'm so talented.

235
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,159
Have you

236
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:27,639
been frequenting brothels?

237
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,360
You seem familiar with this.

238
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:31,039
N-Never, my lady.

239
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:32,679
I've never been to such places.

240
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,440
All thanks to your guidance.

241
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:36,159
Is that so?

242
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,919
Anyway,

243
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:41,279
obtain the Immortal's Ecstasy.

244
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:43,399
With this honey trap

245
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:44,440
to win over Hua Yuenu,

246
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,360
she'll hand over the Immortal's Ecstasy.

247
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,360
Then,

248
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,600
our mission will be accomplished.

249
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:52,840
Understood.

250
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:53,720
My lady.

251
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:03,600
(Ya'er.)

252
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,399
(Remember.)

253
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,200
(You're now a Qidan warrior.)

254
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,840
- (Hu people respect Qidan people.)
- Hello.

255
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,120
(No matter what,)

256
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,200
(stay composed.)

257
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,488
- (Get your mission done.)
- Hello.

258
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,639
- Hello.
- Hello.

259
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:17,039
Hello.

260
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,240
Hello.

261
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,600
My guest.

262
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,519
I wish to see Hua Yuenu.

263
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:25,720
Understood.

264
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,720
I'm former chief
of Lulong Dark Guards, Hua Yuenu.

265
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,680
Greetings, Young Master.

266
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,480
Di Long, who infiltrated

267
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:52,879
into the wedding entourage
as Judicial Minister,

268
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,600
failed to complete the plan.

269
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,399
Now the court seems to be investigating.

270
00:13:58,039 --> 00:13:59,200
We await your advice.

271
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:05,600
By marrying in my father's stead,

272
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:07,480
I'll inevitably draw Jinlouzi's pursuit.

273
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:08,879
Remember,

274
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,919
at all costs,

275
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:13,120
protect the princess.

276
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,240
Yes.

277
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:17,159
Hua Yuenu,

278
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:20,240
high-ranking officials frequent you.

279
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:23,840
Use the Immortal's Ecstasy to keep them

280
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,200
and gather intelligence about the Court.

281
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:29,879
Yes.

282
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:36,799
