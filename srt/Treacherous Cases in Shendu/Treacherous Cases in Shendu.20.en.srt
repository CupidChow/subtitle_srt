1
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,399
Qingqing!

2
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:48,799
Qingqing.

3
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:50,200
Ling.

4
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,119
I'm sorry. Leave me alone.

5
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,240
Do you think

6
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,000
I wouldn't notice your scheme?

7
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,479
Release Princess Qingping.

8
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,799
I'll let you leave.

9
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,439
I never intended to leave.

10
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:10,599
Today I must obtain the treasure.

11
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:12,680
Li Huaixian.

12
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,439
Those Qidan people
who ambushed you last time

13
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:17,760
were just

14
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,159
a minor warning.

15
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:20,560
Now,

16
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,879
if I don't get the treasure,

17
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:24,519
what comes next

18
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:27,599
won't be mere Qidan people.

19
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:30,120
Now,

20
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:32,879
I'm going down to get the treasure.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,560
Who...

22
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:37,159
Who dares to move?

23
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,200
My lord,

24
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:39,920
I'll go with you.

25
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:41,600
Let my sister go.

26
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:42,280
No.

27
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,920
- Ling.
- Sister is already injured.

28
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,280
I can't let her be.

29
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:49,959
Then I'll go with you.

30
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,079
Come on.

31
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,304
Qingqing.

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,680
Qingqing.

33
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:09,439
Qingqing.

34
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:10,719
- Ling.
- Qingqing.

35
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,000
Sorry.

36
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:13,800
I'm sorry.

37
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,719
Lord Wuwei.

38
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,560
Please take care of my sister.

39
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:29,719
Ling.

40
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:31,360
Ling.

41
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:44,932
=Treacherous Cases in Shendu=
=Episode 20=

42
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:56,439
Fear not, Ling.

43
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:57,360
I'm here.

44
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:00,039
Xuanzhi.

45
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,919
Promise me one thing.

46
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,560
Say it.

47
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,759
Whatever happens,

48
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,280
don't act recklessly.

49
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:03,800
The Jinlouzi treasure

50
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,719
is finally mine.

51
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,439
Princess,

52
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:15,800
open it.

53
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,000
But I don't know how.

54
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,839
Don't force me.

55
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,839
How dare you!

56
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,199
Calm.

57
00:04:36,596 --> 00:04:38,784
(Youzhou)

58
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:43,480
I think I figure it out.

59
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:45,079
Hurry!

60
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,439
My lord,

61
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,759
did Li Huaixian switch the treasure?

62
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:21,600
Very well.

63
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
This is

64
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,560
one of Jinlouzi's treasures,

65
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,120
Thunderclap Fire.

66
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,720
I've finally found it.

67
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,439
Where's Ling?

68
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:43,560
Answer me! Where is Ling?

69
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:46,959
Given Youzhou's tensions with the court,

70
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,000
war is inevitable.

71
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:49,720
The treasure brings only calamity.

72
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:51,399
Only by surrendering it

73
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,560
to the court

74
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,240
can we secure lasting peace.

75
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,680
They went down

76
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,680
for the treasure.

77
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,439
If you don't rebel,

78
00:05:58,439 --> 00:05:59,240
peace will prevail.

79
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:02,000
You don't need to aid the court
in getting the treasure.

80
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,199
I truly don't understand.

81
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:06,160
You rebelled against Tang,

82
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:07,680
yet now flatter them.

83
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,319
What do you want?

84
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,160
I'm old now.

85
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,759
Must secure

86
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,759
a future for you.

87
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,639
We've grown up.

88
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,240
We have our own future.

89
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:22,600
Grown up?

90
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,040
Then prove it.

91
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:46,079
Forgive me, Father.

92
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:47,639
The princess will be fine.

93
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,519
The world thinks

94
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:59,120
the late Empress left behind

95
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,240
gold and treasure,

96
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:01,279
but they're wrong.

97
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,680
It's the secret arts

98
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,879
and worm sorcery
that 12 Jinlouzi members possess.

99
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:06,519
Among them exists

100
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:07,920
something called Thunderclap Fire.

101
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,560
Back then,

102
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,959
it was the Thunderclap Fire

103
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,199
your mother risked her life for that

104
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,640
let us defeat the Tongluo troops

105
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:16,360
against all odds.

106
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,560
If the Thunderclap Fire
holds such power,

107
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,600
why did you let Ling down there?

108
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,959
It seems

109
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,839
you truly understand

110
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:26,120
what you desire now.

111
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,240
Only the Wu family members

112
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,040
can get out of the Jinlouzi's
secret chamber alive.

113
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:31,519
This was what

114
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,800
the late Empress designed.

115
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:39,439
Hurry!

116
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:44,960
My lord,

117
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,519
what exactly is this?

118
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,959
Tales tell

119
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,120
how Li Huaixian

120
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,759
routed the Tongluo rebels
with a mere handful of troops.

121
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:01,000
They talk him up like he's invincible,

122
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,600
some god

123
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,839
of war.

124
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:07,959
Actually,

125
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,800
he received assistance
from the Jinlouzi.

126
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:11,680
Among these,

127
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,600
the Thunderclap Fire

128
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,040
was the decisive factor.

129
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,439
It seems

130
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:29,120
they've found it.

131
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,120
Father.

132
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,799
Ling and I have committed to each other.

133
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,840
If she died,

134
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,759
I would die with her.

135
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:47,639
With the Thunderclap Fire,

136
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,600
the Tang

137
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:53,360
will surely conquer everything.

138
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,039
- Congratulations, my lord.
- Congratulations, my lord.

139
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:01,120
Ling.

140
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:02,200
Let's go.

141
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:12,120
Want to break your promise?

142
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:16,399
I won't kill you.

143
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,679
But I never promised to let you leave.

144
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,360
What do you want?

145
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:23,799
Back then,

146
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:27,440
if Lord Wu hadn't been indecisive,

147
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,480
the Tang

148
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,759
would never have come to this state.

149
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,360
I helped you get the treasure.

150
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:36,960
Why involve my father?

151
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,919
Back then,

152
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,600
Lord Wu found the Thunderclap Fire,

153
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,320
yet he refused to surrender it,

154
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,200
remaining loyal to the late Emperor.

155
00:09:44,352 --> 00:09:45,080
So I ask you,

156
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,080
did he deserve to die?

157
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:50,080
Li Huaixian said

158
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,559
my father

159
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:54,039
died from poisoning.

160
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,320
You poisoned him!

161
00:09:57,152 --> 00:09:58,519
If I wanted him dead,

162
00:09:58,519 --> 00:09:59,879
I'd have killed him.

163
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:01,600
Why bother with poison?

164
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:03,679
Then how did my father die?

165
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:06,120
We merely imprisoned him

166
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,360
to prevent him
from giving the Thunderclap Fire

167
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,919
to the late Emperor and the Yang family,

168
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:13,759
and waited

169
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,519
for his existing poison to take effect.

170
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,480
I'll kill you!

171
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,159
Calm down.

172
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:28,799
What's that sound?

173
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,240
Watch out!

174
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,320
Let's go.

175
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:49,600
Xuanzhi.

176
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:51,759
Ling.

177
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:53,559
Ling.

178
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:54,399
Are you okay?

179
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:56,519
Why are you here?

180
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:57,919
It's dangerous here. Leave now.

181
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:58,720
Let's go.

182
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:02,840
Let's go.

183
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,320
- Xuanzhi.
- Xuanzhi.

184
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,559
- Xuanzhi.
- Xuanzhi.

185
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:08,039
He's been poisoned.

186
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:09,840
Same as your father

187
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,840
and Li Ya'er's mother.

188
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,000
Where's the antidote?

189
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,759
Only the Jinlouzi members have the cure.

190
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:15,840
But they are

191
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,360
either dead or missing.

192
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:18,639
I fear

193
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:19,919
there's no cure.

194
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,639
Xuanzhi.

195
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:23,080
Xuanzhi.

196
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,440
- Xuanzhi, wake up!
- Hold on.

197
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,440
Xuanzhi.

198
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:45,600
H-How is he?

199
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:46,720
He hasn't awakened.

200
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:48,879
His breath is growing weaker.

201
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:52,320
It's all my fault.

202
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,600
Now that Xuanzhi is frail,

203
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,360
we must do something.

204
00:11:58,159 --> 00:11:59,480
What can we do?

205
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:02,039
Locate Jinlouzi members now,

206
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,120
otherwise...

207
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,600
When Li Ya'er

208
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:10,720
got the Worm Poison,

209
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:12,559
we used the Immortal's Ecstasy.

210
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,679
Should we try?

211
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:16,600
I tried.

212
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:18,840
It doesn't work.

213
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,039
Li Ya'er already sent some over.

214
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,519
Immortal's Ecstasy

215
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:25,200
can kill the worms,

216
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,799
but can't detoxify.

217
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,840
The Worm Sorcerer Sun Er

218
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:33,600
had extensive research on Worm Poisons.

219
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,960
There might be clues
in his medical texts.

220
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,279
We should

221
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,320
send Xuanzhi back to Shendu.

222
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,240
I don't think

223
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:48,159
he can hold up till then.

224
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,879
That night,

225
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,080
those worms

226
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:03,559
seemed to fear me.

227
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,720
All things have their enemies.

228
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,399
Perhaps try my blood.
