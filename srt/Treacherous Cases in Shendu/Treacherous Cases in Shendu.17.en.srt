1
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,600
Your Excellency.

2
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,479
What does Qidan King think

3
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:43,920
of our proposal?

4
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:45,359
Our King says

5
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,960
if Youzhou's 100,000 troops

6
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:48,039
and Qidan's

7
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,039
50,000 warriors

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,159
could strictly

9
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,479
follow your lead,

10
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,600
they'd sweep through defenses

11
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,479
and storm straight into Shendu.

12
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,000
Your King is truly wise.

13
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,399
So, please advise him

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,119
to start preparing.

15
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:03,960
However,

16
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,280
our King heard

17
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,599
that you had

18
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,719
obtained Jinlouzi's treasure.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,319
Who told you that?

20
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:14,400
Last month,

21
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,719
rumors spread from Shendu.

22
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:18,359
I wonder

23
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,200
if it was true.

24
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,760
Jinlouzi's treasure?

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,239
There is no such thing.

26
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:26,480
My lord,

27
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,599
since you seek cooperation with Qidan,

28
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,040
please show us some sincerity.

29
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,640
We don't covet any treasure,

30
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,120
but sustaining an army costs dearly.

31
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,040
If you possess such wealth,

32
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,200
our march against Tang

33
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:43,439
would gain greater certainty.

34
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:45,159
Moreover,

35
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:46,719
it would help speed up

36
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:48,840
your ascension to the throne.

37
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,799
That was a rumor.

38
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,120
Without treasure,

39
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,760
you may not

40
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:58,200
be able to

41
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,599
obtain our elders' approval.

42
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,319
What does

43
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,760
your King want?

44
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,599
You're Qidan-born, too.

45
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,439
You know our kind
outnumber the Han people

46
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,919
in Youzhou.

47
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,400
If you would

48
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,840
cede Youzhou to Qidan,

49
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:16,919
then our King

50
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:18,879
will march south beside you

51
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,520
with full force

52
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:23,639
to crush Shendu.

53
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,400
If I surrender Youzhou

54
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,840
to Qidan,

55
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,319
that'd leave Shendu

56
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,039
defenseless against invasion

57
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:33,879
like meat before wolves.

58
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,960
My lord,

59
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,599
think about it carefully.

60
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,520
Li Ya'er was killed.

61
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:41,280
It might be too late

62
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:43,240
to play loyalist now.

63
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,400
Should our King

64
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,280
accept Tang's terms,

65
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:48,879
Youzhou will face

66
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,759
attacks from both

67
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,719
front and rear.

68
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,680
Is this a threat?

69
00:02:58,919 --> 00:02:59,879
Not at all.

70
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,240
Think carefully.

71
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,120
I shall

72
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,319
take my leave now.

73
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,159
My lord.

74
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:07,879
Bad news.

75
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,319
Li Ya'er raided our camp

76
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:10,840
with the Shadow Guards.

77
00:03:11,008 --> 00:03:12,120
They killed our commander

78
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,280
and burned our provisions.

79
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,599
You...

80
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,479
You set us up.

81
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,919
Who did he say

82
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,439
raided the Qidan camp?

83
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:37,920
=Treacherous Cases in Shendu=
=Episode 17=

84
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:47,680
Xuanzhi.

85
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,719
Are you still mad at me?

86
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,879
Do you have more medicine?

87
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,759
You don't need it.

88
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:57,080
Give it all to me.

89
00:03:58,199 --> 00:03:59,240
I've suffered so much

90
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,479
this past month.

91
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:01,840
I was losing it.

92
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,319
Soon my tears will flow

93
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:06,080
more than your medicine.

94
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:11,080
Panpan.

95
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:12,400
Will you try to

96
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:13,479
get through to him?

97
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,240
I dare not.

98
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,480
He's in rage.

99
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:19,639
You caused the trouble.

100
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,480
Fix it yourself.

101
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,800
Lord Wuwei has arrived.

102
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:38,959
Lord Wuwei.

103
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:41,639
Princess Changle, Wu Lingling.

104
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,439
You do bear some resemblance
to your father.

105
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,240
I pay my respects.

106
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,519
We'll soon be family.

107
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:50,600
No need for formalities.

108
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:56,000
Do you truly intend to marry me?

109
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,519
Why else would I have you travel

110
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:58,720
all this way?

111
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,560
After dinner,

112
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,639
come to my chamber.

113
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:18,879
Among all my sons,

114
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,839
I thought you alone understood me.

115
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,519
But you killed the Qidan commander

116
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,079
and burned their provisions.

117
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,439
You left Youzhou with no way out.

118
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,279
Father.

119
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:32,279
Stop being obsessed.

120
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,399
What's the point

121
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:37,120
even if we obtain Jinlouzi's treasure?

122
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:44,000
After what I've been through in Shendu,

123
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:47,639
I've obtained the ultimate truth.

124
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,360
Whoever wins over the people

125
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,720
claims the throne.

126
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:53,519
Whenever you wage a war

127
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,759
for whatever reason,

128
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:56,360
the suffering

129
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,800
always falls upon the people.

130
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,279
Has that girl bewitched you?

131
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,639
Are you

132
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,199
betraying me for her?

133
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,639
It has nothing to do with Ling.

134
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,120
I'm only telling you the truth, Father.

135
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,959
You're not my son.

136
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:18,639
My son Li Ya'er

137
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:21,199
was meant to conquer the world for me.

138
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,040
Father,

139
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,839
do you mourn

140
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,759
the loss of a son,

141
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,680
or weep for losing

142
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,600
your unstoppable

143
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,959
bloody blade?

144
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,600
I'll kill her right now.

145
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,160
Why can't you see, Father?

146
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:06,920
She has nothing to do with it.

147
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,240
What?

148
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,120
Have you ever

149
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:15,519
truly cared for me?

150
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,600
I've risked my life repeatedly

151
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,279
to complete missions.

152
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,360
You never asked

153
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,560
if I was in pain

154
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,480
or severely hurt.

155
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,360
Even when I faked my death,

156
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:36,399
your only concern

157
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,279
was whether I ruined your great plan.

158
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,360
Tell me.

159
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:46,480
What kind of father

160
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,040
treats his son like this?

161
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,800
Only Ling showed me care.

162
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:04,360
She was my salvation.

163
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,399
I've sealed your major acupoints.

164
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,160
If you truly love this Ling of yours,

165
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:24,120
break through the seals and save her

166
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,120
before I reach her chamber.
