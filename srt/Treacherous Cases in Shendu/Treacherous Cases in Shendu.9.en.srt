10
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,940
(a rare drug that induces
hallucinations and numbness.)

11
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:45,840
(Once diluted, it paralyzes.)

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,640
(This worm)

13
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:50,040
(suffered prolonged exposure.)

14
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:53,159
(Hence, it failed
to kill the host promptly.)

22
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:56,000
If our lord inquires,

23
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,479
what should I say?

24
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:02,000
Tell him that

25
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,680
everything's under control.

26
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,039

Wu Ya'er.

29
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,800
You saw me killing them.

30
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:48,120
Do you think

31
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:50,480
(I'd let you leave alive?)

32
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:52,920
(I fear that I'm an evil person.)

33
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:56,680

(You saved my life)

35
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,000
and gave me hope,

36
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:07,600
yet named me after your enemy.

37
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,680
Why?

38
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,959
How could there be

your life

88
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,639

without drugging me.

101
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:10,399

(she hanged herself.)

106
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:33,559
Take her away.

- Yes.
- Yes.

108
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:38,039
(My mother died 15 years ago.)

109
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,720
(After that,)

110
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,840
(your father Lord Wu
got hold of the painting.)

111
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:45,159
That's my mother's painting.

112
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:46,519
Give it back to me.

114
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:49,480
Give it back.

116
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:56,960
That painting contains

117
00:11:57,879 --> 00:11:59,039
secrets about the treasure?

118
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:02,080
That's right.

119
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:05,080
Lord Wu once commanded

120
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,799
Jinlouzi with it

121
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,759
and obtained the treasure.

122

00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,240

125
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:17,159
only my father knows the truth.

126
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:18,960
I must confront him directly.

127
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:21,480
Can I trust you?

128
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:23,200
If you don't trust me,

129
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:26,240

Also,

132
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,759
was the one who stole the painting

133
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:39,159
one of your people?

134
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,440
No.

135
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:44,159
He could be a Jinlouzi agent.
