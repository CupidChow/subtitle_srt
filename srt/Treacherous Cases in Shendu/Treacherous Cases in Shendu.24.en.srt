1
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:00,679
Hop on.

2
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:01,439
Ling is in danger.

3
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:02,600
Weren't you dead?

4
00:01:02,656 --> 00:01:03,840
You've faked your death, too.

5
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,560
Come on.

6
00:01:08,288 --> 00:01:13,888
=Treacherous Cases in Shendu=
=Episode 24=

7
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:29,560
Tell me. Where is the military token?

8
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:41,359
I...

9
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,640
I swear I don't know.

10
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,799
Qingqing.

11
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:03,359
Ling.

12
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,799
I've searched your belongings.

13
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,599
Where is it?

14
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,919
So you stayed in Youzhou

15
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,919
for the military token?

16
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:15,520
Eunuch Zhongyi

17
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,360
didn't open all the treasure chests.

18
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,639
You entered the tomb

19
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,280
and didn't find the token on him.

20
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,599
Am I right?

21
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:24,879
You're right.

22
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:27,759
The Thunderclap Fire chests
are specially made.

23
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,240
Forcing them open
would cause an explosion.

24
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,719
So I need the military token.

25
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,360
Ling.

26
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:40,240
Tell me. Where is the military token?

27
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,280
Qingqing.

28
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:51,719
Why are you doing all this?

29
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,240
Why?

30
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,919
To never be manipulated again.

31
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,639
To never be bullied again.

32
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:01,680
Haven't you

33
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,159
figured out how Father died?

34
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:08,039
We've endured humiliation
all these years.

35
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,520
Be it the imperial court or Li Huaixian,

36
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:12,800
who was willing to spare us?

37
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:16,240
Why?

38
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,560
To take revenge.

39
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,400
To survive.

40
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,319
Finding the treasure

41
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,520
is our only chance.

42
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:29,280
Others may not understand

43
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,240
the bitterness and hatred in your heart.

44
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:35,080
But I'm your own sister.

45
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:37,280
How could I not understand you?

46
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,560
Ling.

47
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,639
There's another secret
I haven't told you.

48
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:45,919
Actually,

49
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,719
I'm not your real sister.

50
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,599
Your sister died

51
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,560
on her way to Shendu when you were

52
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,960
five years old.

53
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,800
You recall that serious illness I had.

54
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:06,080
It was actually caused

55
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,879
by the worm sorcery

56
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:10,319
Father performed to alter my appearance.

57
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,319
The truth is,

58
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,439
I am one of the Jinlouzi.

59
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,079
My surname is Zhou.

60
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,800
I was an infant abandoned
by the Jinlouzi rebels.

61
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,399
Father took me home.

62
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:26,920
No way.

63
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,839
No way.

64
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:28,839
This is nonsense.

65
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:29,519
Qingqing.

66
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,360
We're sisters who grew up together.

67
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,160
Do you know why

68
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,959
I sent puppets to retrieve the treasure?

69
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,600
Because I'm not from the Wu family.

70
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,839
Those venomous bugs would attack me.

71
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:46,319
From the day Father brought me home,

72
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,439
my whole purpose in life

73
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,680
was to reclaim

74
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,000
what rightfully belongs to Jinlouzi.

You...

80
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:38,519
Ling.

81
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:40,720
You've finally come.

82
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:41,720
Qingqing.

83
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,839
Let's talk this through.

84
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,399
Don't do this.

85
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,319
You're alive?

86
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:48,480
Your antidote

87
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,480
saved me.

88
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,120
I know you're kind-hearted.

89
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:53,279
Why don't we

90
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:54,600
discuss this?

91
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:56,560
There's nothing to discuss.

92
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:59,519
Hand over the military token.

93
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:07,279
You can have it.

94
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:09,040
Release Ling.

95
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:11,120
Why don't you

96
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,319
toss it over?

97
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,199
Do you only want the military token?

98
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,480
Or do you also want military control?

99
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:18,560
What's wrong?

100
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,279
Can't bear to give it up?

101
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,600
I can give up

102
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,160
everything for Ling.

103
00:06:25,504 --> 00:06:26,496
(Youzhou)

104
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:29,759
I tried to dissuade my father, too.

105
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,920
Even if he ascends the throne,

106
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,720
the people would suffer

107
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,399
and might not live a better life.

108
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:36,279
Qingqing.

109
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:39,160
Why would you incur condemnation

110
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,439
for this doomed endeavor?

111
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:42,519
Who said I want the throne?

112
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,800
Who said I want them
to live a better life?

113
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:48,600
I want them

114
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,680
to feel my pain.

115
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:53,160
The loss,

116
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,439
the exile.

117
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,040
Stop this, Qingqing.

118
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,279
Those who wronged you

119
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:02,920
are all dead now.

120
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:04,160
No.

121
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:06,560
It's not enough.

122
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,240
That emperor remains enthroned.

123
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,399
I'll destroy everything he holds dear.

124
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,759
Qingqing.

125
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,920
Our time together

126
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,360
was what truly mattered.

127
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,360
We've shared all those years together.

128
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,600
Haven't you felt any happiness?

129
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,160
I don't believe it.

130
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:26,360
I don't believe it.

131
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,439
You love me.

132
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,199
You loved Mother.

133
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:33,720
Why would you let your hatred

134
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,240
destroy what we have now?

135
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,160
Ling.

136
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,680
You grew up surrounded by love.

137
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,680
You won't understand my suffering.

138
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,320
The military token is mine.

139
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,799
Ling.

140
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:05,720
Qingqing.

141
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,320
Qingqing.

142
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:09,840
Ling.

143
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,159
Take me...

144
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:16,919
home.

145
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:18,240
Qingqing.

146
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,159
Qingqing.

147
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:20,440
Qingqing.

148
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:21,639
Qingqing.

149
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,879
Li Ya'er, find a physician.

150
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,600
Qingqing.

151
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:30,159
Someone help her.

152
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:31,559
Help us.

153
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,279
Qingqing.

154
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,240
Qingqing.

155
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,879
(Youzhou)
Qingqing.

156
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,080
Qingqing.

157
00:09:44,896 --> 00:09:46,880
(Six months later)

158
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,440
Ling.

159
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,000
I was dying, but you rushed

160
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,639
to save Li Ya'er instead.

161
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:02,399
You abandoned me

162
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,240
for a pretty face?

163
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,559
But you didn't die, did you?

164
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,399
I knew you had the antidote.

165
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:09,960
Panpan.

166
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:11,559
Do you think she knew?

167
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,679
That's ancient history.

168
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:14,879
Stop dwelling on it.

169
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:15,600
Yeah.

170
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:16,600
Why don't you

171
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,320
hurry up, instead?

172
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:20,200
Panpan.

173
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:21,879
I'll propose right now.

174
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:23,399
No.

175
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,879
I might not accept it.

176
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,440
I can't lose to Li Ya'er.

177
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:27,240
Then beg me.

178
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:28,039
Beg me.

179
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:28,759
Beg me.

180
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,679
