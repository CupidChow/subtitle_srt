1
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:42,336
(Zuixian Tower)

2
00:01:52,948 --> 00:01:58,560
=Treacherous Cases in Shendu=
=Episode 3=

3
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,359
A dead body.

4
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:07,200
How tragic.

5
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,439
This is horrible.

6
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:09,560
Who killed him?

7
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,439
How tragic.

8
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:13,120
Indeed.

9
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,240
Excuse me.

10
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,080
Who did he offend?

11
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,840
What happened

12
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,919
at Zuixian Tower?

13
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:17,639
So brutal.

14
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:18,280
Outsiders?

15
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:21,000
Three days ago,

16
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,719
a weird murder

17
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:23,039
happened at Zuixian Tower.

18
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,240
Mr. Zhang went to watch Sogdian Whirl

19
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,639
and dropped dead.

20
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,599
Rumors say

21
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:28,840
witnesses saw

22
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,319
that a fairy descended,

23
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:31,599
dragged him into the air,

24
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,719
and hanged him alive.

25
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:33,759
This is creepy.

26
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,159
Is Zuixian Tower

27
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,159
very famous?

28
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:37,039
Absolutely.

29
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,319
It was built

30
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:39,159
by the Hu people.

31
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,080
It has all kinds of

32
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,479
exotic oddities.

33
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:42,840
Its grape wines are also superb.

34
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,919
The Immortal's Ecstasy

35
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:45,800
is said to lure fairies from heaven.

36
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,240
It's intoxicating.

37
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,159
Have you tried it?

38
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,039
No, I haven't.

39
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,080
The dancer and wine keeper Hua Yuenu

40
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,919
has a strange rule.

41
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:56,759
Only guests she hand-picked

42
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,159
get to taste the drink.

43
00:02:58,759 --> 00:02:59,639
She never picked me.

44
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:01,280
Who'd want

45
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,080
such cursed wine?

46
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,968
Hey, you.

47
00:03:03,968 --> 00:03:05,568
You wouldn't understand men's pleasures.

48
00:03:05,568 --> 00:03:06,599
Even nobles here

49
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:07,400
beg for it in vain.

50
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:08,639
You won't get it.

51
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:10,680
After what happened,

52
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,000
will we ever taste it?

53
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,560
Why did it happen exactly

54
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,080
when we're investigating?

55
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,360
Unlike Shendu,

56
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,199
the border town

57
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,599
sees strange things.

58
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:23,840
Don't overthink.

59
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,719
Who are you?

60
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:41,680
Excuse me.

61
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,240
Is this Zhang Liang's residence?

62
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:44,960
Yes.

63
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,680
May I help you?

64
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:47,639
We're

65
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,840
Mr. Zhang's friends.

66
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:50,400
We've come

67
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:51,719
to pay our respects.

68
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,639
Thank you for your kindness.

69
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,479
But his remains

70
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,000
were cremated and buried.

71
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,800
I can take you to his grave.

72
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:06,319
Why did you cremate him

73
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,280
so hastily?

74
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,599
He died mysteriously.

75
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,520
Authorities feared rumors.

76
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,000
That's why.

77
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,639
In that case,

78
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,120
please kindly take us

79
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,000
to pay our respects, Madam.

80
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:53,519
Who are you?

81
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:58,959
I am...

82
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,399
your father's friend.

83
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:04,680
Your mother

84
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,879
was worried about you

85
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:07,480
and sent me here.

86
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,040
I'm hungry.

87
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,120
Here.

88
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,319
Thank you.

89
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,160
Your father's gone.

90
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,279
Are you upset?

91
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:28,120
No.

92
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,920
No one will

93
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,920
bully Mother anymore.

94
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:37,399
Mother said

95
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:38,920
this is the best thing.

96
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,759
Here.

97
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,519
Thank you.

98
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:49,160
Immortal's Ecstasy.

99
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,759
Mr. Zhang,

100
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,399
what a tragedy.

101
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,120
Why did you die so young

102
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,639
and leave me all alone?

103
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,480
I couldn't even

104
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,680
(Zhang Liang's Grave)
see you one last time.

105
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:07,759
Panpan has better

106
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:08,800
acting skills than you.

107
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,800
How am I going to live?

108
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,639
Help her up already.

109
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,920
Others might think

110
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,160
Mr. Zhang was her husband.

111
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,439
This is too dramatic.

112
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:19,199
Alright.

113
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:20,959
Come on.

114
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:21,439
Panpan.

115
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,360
Let me die.

116
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,000
Let me die.

117
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,680
There, there.

118
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,240
You're upsetting Mrs. Zhang.

119
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,800
But you told me to cry out loud.

120
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,720
That's enough.

121
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:34,560
Mrs. Zhang, I'm done.

122
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,199
My condolences.

123
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,959
You wailed so mournfully.

124
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:41,319
Did you have a story with my husband?

125
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,199
Don't talk nonsense.

126
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,199
I've never even met your husband.

127
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,360
I was merely

128
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,120
expressing grief for my cousin.

129
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,639
Yeah.

130
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,959
She's my cousin.

131
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:52,920
She was simply

132
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,120
expressing condolences on my behalf.

133
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,520
(Zhang Liang's Grave)

134
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,079
Mrs. Zhang.

135
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,560
Things must be hard

136
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,439
with your husband gone.

137
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,759
Please accept this.

138
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,279
How could I take it?

139
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,759
I appreciate your kindness.

140
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,160
But take this back.

141
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,079
Just take it.

142
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:20,879
Thank you, then.

143
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:00,720
Wu Ya'er.

144
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,120
Are you sure those heartless words

145
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,800
came from a child's mouth?

146
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:09,079
Don't you see the courtyard

147
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:10,959
full of shattered porcelain and pottery?

148
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,120
Though they didn't elaborate,

149
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,160
I suspect

150
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:15,920
it must have been

151
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:18,040
Zhang Liang's drunken rampage.

152
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:19,279
The fragments

153
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,480
still carry the faint scent

154
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:22,040
of Immortal's Ecstasy.

155
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,600
There are scars

156
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,639
on Mrs. Zhang's arms.

157
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:29,120
If Zhang Liang was poisoned,

158
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:31,079
how did he appear at Zuixian Tower?

159
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:33,600
She couldn't have done this alone.

160
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,840
There must be accomplices.

161
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,840
Hua Yuenu is suspicious too.

162
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,080
Mr. Zhang had so much

163
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,759
of the rare drink.

164
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:46,639
Moreover,

165
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,799
though Mrs. Zhang looked weary,

166
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:50,519
she actually

167
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,000
(trimmed her eyebrows)

168
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,519
(and wore a faint perfume.)

169
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,639
Would someone who lost a loved one

170
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:57,879
bother with grooming?

171
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,440
Even if Mrs. Zhang was the killer,

172
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,519
we couldn't find any evidence

173
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,000
when the body was cremated.

174
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,440
We're investigating
the Immortal's Ecstasy,

175
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:11,639
not the murder case.

176
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:13,519
Clues about the Immortal's Ecstasy

177
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,799
can help us confirm

178
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,000
whether Hua Yuenu is a Jinlouzi.

179
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,240
You were cuter when you were mute.

180
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,399
Stop showing off.

181
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,679
I knew it.

182
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,279
I knew it.

183
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,720
My lady.

184
00:09:59,159 --> 00:09:59,759
Let's do it.

185
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,240
A secret meeting proves nothing.

186
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,559
Let's take a look.

187
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:15,799
Sir.

188
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:16,799
Thank you.

189
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,639
If it weren't for you...

190
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:19,360
Say no more.

191
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,919
You look amazing.

192
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:23,279
Someone came to pay respects today.

193
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:26,080
But they acted strangely.

194
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,000
Were they authorities?

195
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,679
Not exactly.

196
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:31,360
They gave me some money.

197
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,240
But one of them

198
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,000
entered my house when I was away.

199
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:35,759
Did they

200
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,919
find anything?

201
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,559
Probably not.

202
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,039
My daughter said

203
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,679
he just went in for a look and left.

204
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,440
The body has been cremated.

205
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,320
Nothing can be traced.

206
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,440
Get rid of those

207
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,440
Immortal's Ecstasy

208
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:48,879
to avoid complications.

209
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,000
Let me help you.

210
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:55,600
Xuanzhi.

211
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,519
Why did you leave me alone at the inn?

212
00:10:58,519 --> 00:10:59,480
Wait.

213
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:02,200
Wait.

214
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:08,639
We split up.

215
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:09,879
Alright.

216
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:18,559
Xuanzhi.

217
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:19,919
Xuanzhi.

218
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:21,559
Why did you leave me alone at the inn?

219
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:22,939
What if something happens to me?

220
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:23,960
Why did you come out

221
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:25,039
if you were scared?

222
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:25,679
You blew it.

223
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,799
Xuanzhi!

224
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,040
(Zuixian Tower)

225
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:10,799
Who are you, sir?

226
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,679
And who are you?

227
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,440
I am Hua Yuenu.

228
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:22,440
Thank you for your help.

229
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:29,360
Are you

230
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:31,240
interested in the Celestial Dance?

231
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,080
I know the Hu people

232
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,240
are great dancers.

233
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,320
I didn't know you could also

234
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,440
perform such a dance.

235
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:42,639
You flatter me, sir.

236
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,279
My humble attempt

237
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:47,000
is just a poor imitation.

238
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:48,919
If you enjoy watching,

239
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:50,120
I will invite you

240
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,679
for a special viewing.

241
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,399
I'd welcome your guidance.

242
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,919
To a graceful fairy like you,

243
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,039
what guidance

244
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,279
could I offer?

245
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:04,279
Sir,

246
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,200
what brings you here at this hour?

247
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,799
I was chasing a rogue,

248
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,279
but he got away.

249
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,000
Heard anything?

250
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:14,960
I did hear

251
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:17,039
what sounded like footsteps.

252
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:18,600
I thought it was a thief,

253
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:20,360
but then

254
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,200
I bumped into you when I stepped out.

255
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:24,200
I'm sorry I held you back.

256
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,480
It's fine.

257
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:28,276
I'm just glad you're unharmed.

258
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:29,480
It's lucky.

259
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:32,840
Are you

260
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:34,039
with the authorities?

261
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,360
Do I look like an official?

262
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:40,879
Ever since Mr. Zhang died,

263
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:42,320
only the authorities

264
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:43,840
have been visiting.

265
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:46,840
I'm not with the authorities.

266
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:48,879
Nor am I here

267
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:49,960
for Zhang Liang's case.

268
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,559
I've been presumptuous.

269
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,759
May I ask you

270
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,720
something, Miss Hua?

271
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:07,679
Have you heard

272
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:08,960
