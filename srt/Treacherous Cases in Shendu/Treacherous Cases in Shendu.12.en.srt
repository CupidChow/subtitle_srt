1
00:00:38,419 --> 00:00:39,744
(Lord Wu's Mansion)

2
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:49,840
Xuanzhi.

3
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,200
How's she?

4
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:54,159
Her pulse is extremely faint,

5
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:55,439
but she isn't poisoned.

6
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:56,920
Sun Er must've used

7
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:57,799
a technique

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,159
to suspend her breath.

9
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,640
You know the Turtle Breath Technique.

10
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,159
Go check on her.

11
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,239
I noticed when bringing her back,

12
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:07,599
the technique

13
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:09,120
might not help her.

14
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,840
We need clues from Sun Er's place.

15
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,480
I've retrieved everything

16
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,879
from Sun Er's secret chamber.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,040
Let's go take a look.

18
00:01:25,523 --> 00:01:30,971
=Treacherous Cases in Shendu=
=Episode 12=

19
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,280
Sun Er was actually pitiable.

20
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:38,560
If he hadn't taken my sister,

21
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:40,359
I wouldn't hate him.

22
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,840
You're too kind.

23
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,359
No need to show mercy

24
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:46,000
to those who plot against

25
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,200
the Wu family.

26
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:52,879
Well,

27
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,400
when my sister and I

28
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:55,920
fled to Chang'an,

29
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,280
she fell gravely ill.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,799
At that time,

31
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:00,239
the Sun family sent a child

32
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,719
with a secret prescription.

33
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:04,400
I suspect

34
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,239
that child was Sun Er.

35
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:08,520
What?

36
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:09,960
I didn't know it.

37
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:12,199
It just suddenly came back to me.

38
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,599
After Father died,

39
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:15,960
the Wu family declined.

40
00:02:16,128 --> 00:02:17,376
No imperial physicians came,

41
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,919
except Sun Er.

42
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,879
Look what happened now.

43
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,759
Fate plays cruel tricks.

44
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,360
Indeed.

45
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:28,360
If not for Li Huaixian,

46
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,080
the Wu family

47
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:31,639
wouldn't be like this.

48
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:34,919
Guo Xuanzhi.

49
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,080
Stop talking sarcastically.

50
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,879
Speak your mind.

51
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,680
You are Wu Ya'er.

52
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,199
What's it to you?

53
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,240
I am Li Ya'er now.

54
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,680
What now?

55
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,120
Finally admit it?

56
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,520
Enough!

57
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,080
No time for this.

58
00:02:58,199 --> 00:02:58,976
Your family

59
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,599
sought this marriage.

60
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,080
You should take

61
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:03,479
responsibility.

62
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,479
The Li family will take responsibility.

63
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:07,199
Don't worry about it, outsider.

64
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:08,240
See, Ling?

65
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,520
This is your future nephew.

66
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:11,560
Such filial piety.

67
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:13,240
Don't worry about it, outsider.

68
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,039
We'll never become relatives.

69
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:32,736
Ling.

70
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,759
Tell me the truth.

71
00:03:34,144 --> 00:03:34,840
What's going on

72
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,840
between you and Li Ya'er?

73
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:37,159
Xuanzhi.

74
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,800
I need his help

75
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,120
to investigate the Jinlouzi.

76
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:42,159
But he looks at you

77
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,479
with affection.

78
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,360
Do you also...?

79
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:49,240
Ling.

80
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:52,240
Remember one thing.

81
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,360
I won't give up on you.

82
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,120
Xuanzhi.

83
00:03:58,719 --> 00:03:59,960
I must tell you something.

84
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:02,800
We found the Jinlouzi painting.

85
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,840
It wasn't stolen?

86
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:09,719
That one was a forgery.

87
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,599
I hid the genuine one

88
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:12,919
in a secret compartment

89
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,960
under my sister's bed.

90
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:18,784
Good.

91
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,639
That's good.

92
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,120
Take a good rest.

93
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,240
I'll leave.

94
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:35,968
Ling.

95
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:37,399
Have some food.

96
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:44,480
We should meet less often.

97
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:46,279
Just because of

98
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:47,399
Guo Xuanzhi's

99
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:48,680
words today?

100
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,319
Not at all.

101
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,360
Ling.

102
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,279
I don't want to be your nephew.

103
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,560
It's not up to you.

104
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,240
It's the fact.

105
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,720
What?

106
00:05:01,248 --> 00:05:02,752
Your sister hasn't been married off.

107
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:04,120
I bet you don't

108
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,160
want her to marry anyway.

109
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:05,959
Besides,

110
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,480
we two have already...

111
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,079
Stop the nonsense.

112
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,399
Am I talking nonsense?

113
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,959
Shall I jog your memory?

114
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:15,120
I even have...

115
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,399
Li Ya'er!

116
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,040
Leave right now!

117
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:21,959
Fine.

118
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,920
This bite mark of yours

119
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,480
will probably stay on me for life.

120
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,680
What if my future wife

121
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,000
sees it?

122
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,319
Take responsibility.

123
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,319
Come on.

124
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:31,639
Get out.

125
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:32,800
Get out!

126
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:34,752
You...

127
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:35,600
I...

128
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:36,439
Let go of me!

129
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:37,600
If you keep shouting,

130
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,680
everyone in the mansion

131
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,839
will know about
our immoral relationship.

132
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,439
Li Ya'er.

133
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,040
Why are you so shameless?

134
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:46,519
I regret saving you.

135
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,240
Too late.

136
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:51,360
You...

137
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:54,360
How to make you let me go?

138
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,480
Two things.

139
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,639
Say it.

140
00:06:01,984 --> 00:06:03,840
Don't distance yourself from me

141
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,959
because of your sister.

142
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,959
And the second?

143
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:09,000
Well,

144
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,680
I'll tell you

145
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,680
after I capture the black-clothed thief
who stole the painting

146
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,319
tonight.

147
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:30,839
Stop searching.

148
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,240
Xuanzhi.

149
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,319
It was Li Ya'er's idea?

150
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,399
Yes.

151
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:48,920
Why?

152
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:50,680
Ling,

153
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,199
I did it to protect you.

154
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,160
Did you attempt to kill my sister?

155
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:58,199
How's that possible?

156
00:06:59,360 --> 00:06:59,920
I was...

157
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:02,240
ordered to get that painting.

158
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,240
The painting

159
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,680
in Wu Lingling's hands

160
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,800
is the key to locating the treasure.

161
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:09,240
Keep an eye on it.

162
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:11,399
When necessary,

163
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,480
bring it

164
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,120
to me.

165
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,480
Yes.

166
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:22,120
Can I still trust you now?

167
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,199
I've only deceived you this once.

168
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,680
I had to.

169
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,000
You had to?

170
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:29,839
Do you realize

171
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,120
how many enemies
the Wu family has in court

172
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:34,439
and why your father died?

173
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,560
What's it to do with my father?

174
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:42,279
Your father

175
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,800
refused to aid His Highness

176
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:46,000
and surrender the Jinlouzi treasure,

177
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,759
so he was executed.

178
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:49,839
All these years,

179
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:52,240
many requested to eliminate your family.

180
00:07:52,869 --> 00:07:54,199
Without the Emperor's protection,

181
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:55,480
you would've died.

182
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:58,720
How do you know all this?

183
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,199
When Lord Wu was executed,

184
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:02,639
my father witnessed it.

185
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:06,639
My father doesn't let me marry you

186
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,240
but I already fall for you.

187
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:11,720
Only by gaining the Emperor's favor

188
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,399
can I withstand the pressure.

189
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:16,384
Only by becoming Tiance Army's commander

190
00:08:16,384 --> 00:08:18,319
and secretly monitoring
officials for the court

191
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,160
can I earn a sliver of hope
to be with you.

192
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:23,279
What else are you hiding?

193
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:27,560
The Emperor desires
to get the Jinlouzi treasure.

194
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,680
I have to obtain it

195
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,839
to protect your family.

196
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,480
The marriage alliance

197
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:35,080
is merely a ploy to find the treasure.

198
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,448
Ling,

199
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,240
I won't let you take risks.

200
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:41,600
Xuanzhi.

201
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,480
Go back.

202
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:47,799
Ling.

203
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,080
I'm sorry.

204
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:51,919
It's all my fault.

205
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,720
I want to have a moment alone.

206
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,360
If you're angry,

207
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:01,960
just vent your anger

208
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,960
on me.

209
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,320
Don't leave me.

210
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,080
Ling.

211
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:38,039
He left.

212
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,720
Why the tears?

213
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:55,480
I don't know.

214
00:09:58,639 --> 00:09:59,840
Do you hate Guo Xuanzhi?

215
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:04,519
Why would I hate him?

216
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:09,440
He's sacrificed and suffered

217
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:12,919
so much for me.

218
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:17,120
And my father,

219
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:18,960
my sister...

220
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,120
I can only hate myself
for being useless.

221
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:28,759
They love you,

222
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,240
so they protect you.

223
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,159
Of course, it doesn't

224
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,559
include Guo Xuanzhi.

225
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,440
The Wu family now relies on me.

226
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:45,840
I can't cry anymore.

227
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,519
You still have me.

228
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:49,320
You're not one of the Wu family.

229
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:51,960
Marry me and I'll become one.

230
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,919
What did you say?

231
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:56,224
Fine.

232
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:57,960
Then I'll

233
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,279
go back and discuss

234
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,559
marrying into your family.

235
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:03,120
At worst, my father breaks my leg.

236
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,320
Don't look down on me then.

237
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:07,320
First, figure out

238
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,919
your family matters.

239
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:11,639
So, you agree?

240
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:18,208
Panpan.

241
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,240
Feeling better?

242
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:21,000
The physician said I'm recovered.

243
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,159
Thanks to your first aid,

244
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:24,679
so I can heal quickly. Thank you.

245
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:26,399
Don't mention it.

246
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:28,240
Xuanzhi.

247
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,759
Why standing there?

248
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,279
Come here.

249
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:46,519
You two

250
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:48,240
had a fight?

251
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,200
No.

252
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,432
By the way,

253
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,240
I heard

254
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,440
you found your sister?

255
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,480
How is she?

256
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:00,360
Her health hasn't improved.

257
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,639
She's unconscious.

258
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:03,639
Maybe

259
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:05,000
we should consult Mr. Sun.

260
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,840
He's a descendant of Medicine God.

261
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:07,799
The prescription

262
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,279
he provided

263
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,039
cured me.

264
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,159
Mr. Sun's prescription?

265
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:13,919
When did it happen?

266
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,000
The day after I was brought back.

267
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:17,399
It's been some days.

268
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:18,840
What's wrong?

269
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,480
That was the day before

270
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:23,159
we found him.

271
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,512
(Palace Sedan Painting)

272
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,240
Guess who I am.

273
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,120
Why asked me out

274
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,480
at this hour?

275
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:04,120
Miss me?

276
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,240
Take this painting

277
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:10,559
and leave.

278
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,159
Testing me?

279
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,960
I trust you.

280
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:28,559
This painting

281
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:30,559
holds too many interests.

282
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,159
It took

283
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:33,519
my father,

284
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,120
and now

285
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:36,799
it almost took my sister.

286
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,159
Both the court and Youzhou want it.

287
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:41,879
If I keep it,

288
00:13:42,944 --> 00:13:44,360
Lord Wu's Mansion stays in turmoil.

289
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,799
I don't trust anyone else.

290
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,799
I can only entrust it

291
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,519
to you.

292
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,168
Ling.

293
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:01,679
I'll definitely find a way

294
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:02,360
to protect you.

295
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,000
Convince your father

296
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:07,840
to stop rebelling.

297
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,360

298
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:11,759
the people suffer.

299
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:16,080
My sister and I have witnessed

300
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:19,039
countless families destroyed

301
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:22,679

You...

306
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:41,519
You burned it?

307
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,600
There's nothing

308
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:45,879
I can't leave except you.

309
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:47,559
This was your mother's keepsake.

310
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,679
Don't you want to keep it?

311
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:53,600
My remembrance of my mother

312
00:14:53,888 --> 00:14:54,799
is buried in my mind.

313
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:55,600
It shall never fade.

314
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,120
But if burning this painting

315
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,639
could ensure

316
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,559
your safety

317
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:03,559
and peace,

318
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:05,879
that matters most to me.

319
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,799
What about your father?

320
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:13,399
Ling.

321
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:14,720
In the past,

322
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,600
I'd have sided

323
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,879
with my father.

324
00:15:18,464 --> 00:15:19,648
But after I lost my memories,

325
00:15:19,648 --> 00:15:20,399
you saved me

326
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:21,840
and kept me around,

327
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,679
I realized

328
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:24,080
that the peace of the world

329
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:26,440
is what we should pursue most.

330
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:29,919
Without this painting and treasure,

331
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,159
the court and Youzhou

332
00:15:32,384 --> 00:15:33,504
won't disturb each other.

333
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:36,759
But if either gains this treasure,

334
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,960
