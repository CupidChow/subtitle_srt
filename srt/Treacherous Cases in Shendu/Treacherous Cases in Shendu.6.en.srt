00:00:41,072 --> 00:00:43,313
(Dali Court)

2
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:54,600
Weird.

3
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,439
So eerie.

4
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,759
The corpse has been here half a month,

5
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:00,000
not decaying at all.

6
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:17,680
The...

7
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:18,079
The...

8
00:01:19,266 --> 00:01:20,416
The corpse is reanimating!

9
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,159
It...

10
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,000
It is reanimating!

11
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,120
Someone help!

12
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,439
Help!

13
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:28,000
One more step.

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,719
We'll attack!

15
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,120
Attack!

16
00:01:45,184 --> 00:01:50,272
=Treacherous Cases in Shendu=
=Episode 6=

17
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:54,319
Xuanzhi.

18
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:56,359
Who is the Night Emperor?

19
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:58,959
He is beyond

20
00:01:59,488 --> 00:02:00,288
the sun and moon.

21
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:01,799
Of both realms.

22
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:03,159
He can skim

23
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:04,439
all worldly affairs.

24
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,959
About the strange insect

25
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,079
in the morgue of Dali Court,

26
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:08,599
he'll surely know something.

27
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:09,800
Is he that amazing?

28
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,840
This place is too dark

29
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,479
to inhabit.

30
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:17,159
Indeed.

31
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,680
Silence.

32
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,520
46.

33
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,800
47.

34
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,039
48.

35
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:31,319
This is it.

36
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,199
Forty private, eighteen bloom.

37
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:40,439
The salmon springs, the lintel rings.

38
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,159
Xuanzhi.

39
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,840
Why is this place so eerie?

40
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,800
Does the Night Emperor

41
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,439
look like a ghost?

42
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:33,919
How rude you are!

43
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,800
Xuanzhi.

44
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,400
He is the Night Emperor?

45
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:44,879
You're so prestige,

46
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,919
knowing all affairs.

47
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,159
We aren't coming

48
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:47,800
to offend you,

49
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,639
but to

50
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,879
seek answers.

51
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:51,800
With a reward.

52
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:53,639
You are quite sensible.

53
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,879
We want to ask what this is.

54
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:05,879
It became a cocoon.

55
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,800
First in larval state,

56
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:10,400
later self-entombed in cocoon.

57
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:16,079
This is the Mother-Child Worm.

58
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,199
Common in Miaojiang.

59
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:22,160
It is cultivated within
human or animal corpses.

60
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,920
Mother and Child worms
share consciousness.

61
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:27,000
By controlling the Mother Worm,

62
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:29,519
the Child Worm miles away

63
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,920
can control their hosts.

64
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,079
Thus, enabling

65
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:33,519
kill without trace.

66
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,519
But breeding them is arduous.

67
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:39,279
It's lost to the world for 30 years.

68
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,199
Yet now,

69
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:43,240
it shows up again.

70
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,000
Why is it like this now?

71
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,120
This is your second question.

72
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,079
The Mother Worm controlling it died,

73
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:06,560
so it cocoons

74
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,959
to transition from Child to Mother.

75
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,439
Yet this Child Worm

76
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,040
wouldn't transition successfully.

77
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,160
Why?

78
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:29,079
Normally, they should be

79
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:32,000
robust and plump.

80
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,319
Yet this cocoon indicates

81
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:37,639
its undersized form

82
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,240
and stunted growth.

83
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,639
After transition,

84
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,000
it cannot spawn many Child Worms.

85
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:45,000
This cocoon

86
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,319
isn't pure white,

87
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,439
but with pale yellow.

88
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,079
I guess

89
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:53,600
long-term drug exposure

90
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,920
severed the link
between Mother and Child worms.

91
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:58,360
The Mother Worm's death

92
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:00,399
triggered its cocooning.

93
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,240
What about this?

94
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:17,240
Immortal's Ecstasy,

95
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:20,079
a rare drug that induces
hallucinations and numbness.

96
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:22,920
Once diluted, it paralyzes.

97
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:25,000
This worm

98
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,319
suffered prolonged exposure.

99
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:28,480
Hence,

100
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,920
it failed to kill the host promptly.

101
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,439
So,

102
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:34,759
the Judicial Minister

103
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,720
consumed the Immortal's Ecstasy

104
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,120
that made him

105
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:39,759
to avoid dying with the others.

106
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:04,959
Ling.

107
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:07,240
It's cold.

108
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,920
Don't catch a chill.

109
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,879
Go get some rest.

110
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,920
I'm okay.

111
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:15,040
Not tired yet.

112
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:34,079
Ling.

113
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:35,600
I love you.

114
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:38,040
Let me be your support.

115
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,680
Okay?

116
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,040
X-Xuanzhi.

117
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,240
I appreciate your love.

118
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,639
All these years,

119
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,240
you've excused my faults,

120
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,560
tolerated my moods,

121
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:52,360
and enabled all my choices.

122
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,720
But I can't marry you.

123
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:56,959
Ling.

124
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,519
I did all that willingly.

125
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,439
My greatest happiness is to marry you.

126
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,720
Moreover,

127
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
if you don't marry me,

128
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:08,120
I fear the court

129
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,720
will soon involve you in a political

130
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:11,040
marriage alliance.

131
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,000
Wu Ya'er.

132
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:19,560
Want to kill me?

133
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,759
How dare you try to kiss her.

134
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,120
Deserve death.

135
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:25,160
Wu Ya'er,

136
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:27,120
stop acting rashly.

137
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:29,920
What do you mean?

138
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:30,720
My lady,

139
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,480
he's acting rashly.

140
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,440
Don't you see

141
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,440
she doesn't want it?

142
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,759
Is this your Guo family's discipline?

143
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,559
My Guo family's discipline

144
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,559
isn't for you, an outsider,

145
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,399
to judge.

146
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:43,840
Besides,

147
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,679
I'm Ling's betrothed.

148
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,360
Why do you interfere?

149
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,080
Enough!

150
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,399
Xuanzhi,

151
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,360
what do you mean?

152
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:01,720
I heard from Father

153
00:09:02,016 --> 00:09:03,159
that the Emperor still wants

154
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:04,519
a political marriage with Youzhou.

155
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,159
What if he sends you...

156
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:06,919
Enough.

157
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,000
I understand.

158
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,080
Know what you did wrong?

159
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,080
I did nothing wrong.

160
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,679
Anyone who dares disrespect you

161
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:21,080
deserves death.

162
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,240
Wu Ya'er!

163
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,759
Forgot what you promised me?

164
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,399
You vowed to protect me

165
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:27,840
and those around me.

166
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,159
Forgot all these?

167
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:31,200
I didn't.

168
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:31,960
But...

169
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,200
Enough.

170
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,679
Don't you keep your promises?

171
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,039
No.

172
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,399
Now shake hands and make peace.

173
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,879
He wanted to kill me.

174
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,759
And I make peace with him?

175
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:48,120
Don't you listen to me?

176
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:04,639
Go rest.

177
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,759
We'll investigate the worm tomorrow.

178
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,039
Why is Wu Ya'er

179
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,320
kneeling there?

180
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,159
No idea.

181
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,960
Been kneeling all night.

182
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,559
Seems he does it voluntarily.

183
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:41,279
You may go.

184
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:42,279
- Yes.
- Yes.

185
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,360
Why are you kneeling?

186
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,799
Are you still angry?

187
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,399
Why would I be angry?

188
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:05,720
I was wrong last night.

189
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,480
I shouldn't quarrel with Guo Xuanzhi

190
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,200
and make you upset.

191
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,440
Deserve it.

192
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:12,159
So you use this trick

193
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,519
to make me pity you?

194
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:14,799
No.

195
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:15,919
It's my fault,

196
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,399
failing to keep my word.

197
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,159
I was wrong.

198
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:23,799
Okay.

199
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,720
Don't do this again.

200
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:26,919
Understood?

201
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:28,240
Understood.

202
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,320
Get up.

203
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,919
I told you to get up.

204
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,399
Now it hurts?

205
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:10,639
Come sit and eat.

206
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,159
You've grown crafty.

207
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:25,720
Used a trick to earn pity.

208
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:27,639
Your memories are missing,

209
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:29,080
but you're still scheming.

210
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:29,799
Xuanzhi.

211
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:30,960
Enough.

212
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:33,159
What about the worm thing?

213
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,399
I tweaked

214
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,440
the Mother Worm rig in the Black Market.

215
00:12:37,856 --> 00:12:39,900
It'll warn us if the one
to cast the worm is nearby.

216
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:40,759
Then,

217
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:41,919
we could capture him

218
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:42,879
right away.

219
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,639
He killed my sister.

220
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:53,320
I'll end him myself.

221
00:12:58,848 --> 00:13:00,679
(Memorial)

222
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,039
Never thought beyond Shendu

223
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:03,639
lay such a desolate place.

224
00:13:04,288 --> 00:13:05,448
After the foreign invasion,

225
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,639
though Shendu remains prosperous,

226
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,159
many places

227
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:10,360
have declined.

228
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:13,200
Shendu is maintained

229
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,679
by draining the whole realm.

230
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:16,720
Are you sure Jinlouzi is here?

231
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,000
Yes.

232
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:20,200
The Mother Worm points this way.

233
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:21,720
Further north

234
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
lies Youzhou territory.

235
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,519
Xuanzhi,

236
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,600
what custom is this?

237
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,600
No idea.

238
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,320
White lanterns

239
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:32,879
and coffins.

240
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:34,919
Eerie.

241
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,240
Xuanzhi,

242
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,879
let's leave. I'm scared.

243
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:39,600
That's all you say?

244
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,080
I'm here, fear not.

245
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,600
Right.

246
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,000
A living person?

247
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:51,639
Old man.

248
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:52,759
Old man.

249
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,360
Old man.

250
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:58,480
Leave now.

251
00:13:58,559 --> 00:13:59,000
Leave!

252
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,240
Mr. Immortal's coming.

253
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:01,559
Mr. Immortal?

254
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,600
You folks are new?

255
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:04,320
Yeah.

256
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,279
Please enlighten us.

257
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,679
That's my father.

258
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,360
He's ill.

259
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,840
Mr. Immortal will take him to heal.

260
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:11,879
Leave now.

261
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,879
Don't get in the way.

262
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,000
Go now.
