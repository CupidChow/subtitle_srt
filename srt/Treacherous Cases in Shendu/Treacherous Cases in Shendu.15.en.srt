1
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,320
I've been training you

2
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,079
just for the very moment.

3
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,640
This is how you
gather intelligence for me?

4
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,520
Calm your anger.

5
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,600
Sorry, I failed.

6
00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:59,520
Master, please grant us another chance.

7
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:02,359
I keep

8
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,439
your life for now.

9
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,680
Don't let

10
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:09,040
anyone else know about it.

11
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:09,760
Yes.

12
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:10,439
Besides,

13
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,799
recall all Shadow Guards from Shendu.

14
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:16,200
Inform the mobilized troops

15
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,959
to come back

16
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:19,439
for a new plan.

17
00:01:20,608 --> 00:01:25,600
=Treacherous Cases in Shendu=
=Episode 15=

18
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,040
Are you really okay?

19
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:27,959
Let me check.

20
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,040
I'm truly okay.

21
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:31,200
However,

22
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,200
that person
has excellent martial skills.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,519
He subdued me instantly.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,760
Alright.

25
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:40,159
I'll stay to protect you tonight.

26
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,040
I won't leave.

27
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,200
No way.

28
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,840
If someone discovers us,

29
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,319
our plan will be ruined.

30
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,599
What if that person returns?

31
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:47,760
Don't care about the plan.

32
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,840
Well,

33
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:53,040
should I

34
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,280
tell Xuanzhi the truth?

35
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:55,879
Then he could help.

36
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,560
Seeing him grieve for me,

37
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:00,959
I feel somewhat guilty.

38
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,599
Guilty?

39
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,079
Very well.

40
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,599
You feel guilty
when Guo Xuanzhi grieves.

41
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:13,919
I've been living a wandering life.

42
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:16,000
Why don't you care for me?

43
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,879
Don't I care for you?

44
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,560
I weep so sadly

45
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,479
every day.

46
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,000
Don't I care for you?

47
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,080
Fine.

48
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,039
I forgive you.

49
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:31,599
But honestly,

50
00:02:33,248 --> 00:02:33,919
you...

51
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:35,719
Your acting was so real

52
00:02:36,192 --> 00:02:37,680
that it made me feel I'd truly died.

53
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:38,960
I feel so terrible.

54
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:41,639
So how much longer

55
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:43,080
do I have to act?

56
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,800
In Youzhou.

57
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:46,479
When in Youzhou,

58
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:47,439
nothing to fear then.

59
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:51,639
When in Youzhou,

60
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,199
you'll have to call me Mother.

61
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,719
Is it funny?

62
00:02:58,879 --> 00:02:59,919
Why not?

63
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,800
I'd gain a fine son.

64
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,759
Is it funny?

65
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:06,360
Is it funny?

66
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,080
Stop it.

67
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Someone might come.

68
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:11,560
Ling,

69
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:12,960
rest assured.

70
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,319
I will protect you.

71
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:15,800
When in Youzhou,

72
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,439
I'll tell my father about us.

73
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,479
But about the court,

74
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,319
Youzhou, and Jinlouzi,

75
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,479
everything is complex.

76
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,080
It won't be that easy.

77
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,199
Then we'll

78
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,319
tackle them one by one.

79
00:03:41,248 --> 00:03:43,719
(Governor's Mansion)

80
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:44,736
By the Mandate of Heaven,

81
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:46,080
the Emperor decrees

82
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,010
that Li Huaixian,

83
00:03:47,168 --> 00:03:48,544
who succeeded in repelling Qidan,

84
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:51,280
is hereby entitled as Lord Wuwei.

85
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:52,830
Hereditary and irreplaceable.

86
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:53,879
Princess Changle,

87
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,639
Wu Lingling,

88
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,240
reverent and virtuous,

89
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,560
talented and beautiful,

90
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:58,599
is now

91
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:00,840
betrothed to Youzhou's Li Huaixian,

92
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,920
as principal consort.

93
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:03,599
So decreed.

94
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:06,112
- Much obliged, Your Majesty.
- Much obliged, Your Majesty.

95
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:15,080
Come on.

96
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,759
Lord Wuwei is absent?

97
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:23,920
It is our custom.

98
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:26,140
Before the wedding,
the groom can't meet the bride.

99
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:27,720
Madam.

100
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,720
Allow me to introduce.

101
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,000
This is Lord Wuwei's eldest son, Li Lin,

102
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,360
and his second son, Li Lie.

103
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:35,319
Come.

104
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:36,199
Huan, Xi.

105
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,600
Greet your grandmother.

106
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:40,000
- Greetings, Grandmother.
- Greetings, Grandmother.

107
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,639
- May you enjoy boundless blessings.
- May you enjoy boundless blessings.

108
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:42,959
Rise now.

109
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:47,279
Such adorable children

110
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:48,519
are Li Lin's children

111
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:49,800
or Li Lie's children?

112
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,120
Madam.

113
00:04:51,296 --> 00:04:53,400
These two children are not

114
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,560
two young masters' children,

115
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,120
but Mr. Ya'er's.

116
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:20,560
Others won't join us for the meal?

117
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:21,839
Madam.

118
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,759
Two young masters have their families.

119
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:25,560
They dine at their mansions.

120
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:27,120
Master asked me

121
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:28,759
to bring the children

122
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,360
to dine with you,

123
00:05:30,366 --> 00:05:31,456
in case you'd feel lonely.

124
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,839
(Li Ya'er!)

125
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:40,000
(These two children
do look a bit like him.)

126
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,319
Eat some vegetables to cool your temper.

127
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,519
Why be mad at a dead man?

128
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,480
Why would I?

129
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,000
Becoming a grandmother suddenly,

130
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,519
I've got a jackpot.

131
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:59,759
I should burn incense to thank him.

132
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,120
Grandmother, you're so beautiful.

133
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,959
You're Huan, right?

134
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:11,160
How old are you?

135
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,079
Five years old.

136
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:18,360
(Li Ya'er was only fifteen when he...)

137
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,959
Where is

138
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:24,040
your mother?

139
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:25,199
Grandfather said

140
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:27,120
Mother went to another world.

141
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:28,040
Right.

142
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:34,839
Do you want to see your father?

143
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,079
Yes.

144
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:37,319
But we've never met him.

145
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:39,519
Before Mr. Ya'er went to Shendu,

146
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,240
they hadn't arrived in Youzhou yet.

147
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,120
Li Ya'er stationed at the camp.

148
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:44,879
Why was there a woman?

149
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:45,759
Well,

150
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,079
I didn't dare to ask.

151
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,240
He was quite horny.

152
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,399
All men

153
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,519
are alike.

154
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:18,120
The army had already secretly removed,

155
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:20,959
yet two days ago, they went back.

156
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:22,079
Lin.

157
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:24,199
What is Father planning?

158
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:25,720
Any news from

159
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,639
the Shadow Guards?

160
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,399
They leak

161
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,839
nothing out.

162
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:31,079
I bet this matter

163
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:31,959
relates to Ya'er

164
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:33,639
and his situation in Shendu.

165
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,519
The Shadow Guard teams

166
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:36,759
were all killed in Shendu.

167
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,040
Do you think

168
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,439
if Ya'er...

169
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,920
That's possible.

170
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,600
With Youzhou's military strength,

171
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,240
if we rebel,

172
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,759
our chance of victory is slim.

173
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:52,120
Father has always been cautious.

174
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,879
If not for Ya'er,

175
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:56,120
he wouldn't

176
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,800
mobilize troops so easily.

177
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,120
What did the Qidan King say?

178
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:01,959
Qidan King

179
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:03,959
also knows Father
can't guarantee victory.

180
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,279
Though he deployed troops at the border,

181
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:07,800
he has no intention to march.

182
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,000
He probably

183
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,319
wants to be an onlooker.

184
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,480
That cunning man!

185
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,120
Now the princess is here.

186
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,160
Then the Qidan King

187
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,959
won't send troops to aid Father?

188
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:20,120
Not necessarily.

189
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,399
Ya'er is still missing,

190
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:25,040
yet Father still marries Wu Lingling.

191
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,439
He probably wants to use

192
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:29,120
the Jinlouzi treasure.

193
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:31,920
Money alone won't help.

194
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,360
What we lack is manpower.

195
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,159
Father once defeated rebel forces
against overwhelming odds.

196
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,600
It's all thanks
to the Jinlouzi treasure.

197
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,200
With the treasure,

198
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,039
we can march north

199
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,240
to conquer Qidan,

200
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,039
or head south

201
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,440
to overthrow the emperor.

202
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,240
Then we'll

203
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:49,320
get the initiative.

204
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:50,639
Wu Lingling

205
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,440
clearly sides with the court.

206
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:53,799
Will she help us?

207
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,919
It doesn't matter.

208
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,080
What matters is

209
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,360
to take her life.

210
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:04,840
Madam.

211
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,519
Please.

212
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,519
Madam,

213
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:15,879
Mr. Ya'er instructed in his letter

214
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:17,799
to decorate it
in your maiden home's style.

215
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:19,639
I wonder if you like it.

216
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:23,600
Thank you.

217
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:25,879
May I ask

218
00:09:26,592 --> 00:09:27,808
when Li Ya'er got married?

219
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,879
My lord,

220
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,519
he didn't get married.

221
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,720
Those two children

222
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,279
were born from his mistress.

223
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:35,840
They only reunited with us
six months ago.

224
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:38,919
Thank you.

225
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,039
You may leave.

226
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:40,720
Yes.

227
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:46,279
Ling.

228
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,240
See?

229
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:49,320
That Li Ya'er is a fraud.

230
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,480
He has two children.

231
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:52,320
And you're grieving for him.

232
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:53,519
Had I known,

233
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,159
I'd have scattered his ashes

234
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,279
into the lake.

235
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:58,320
Beautiful women deceive.

236
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:00,440
So do handsome men.

237
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,039
Ling,

238
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,799
don't forget our purpose here.

239
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:14,720
Ling.

240
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,120
My offer still stands.

241
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:17,559
If you want to,

242
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:19,120
I'll take you away anytime.

243
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,000
I came to be his mother,

244
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,960
not to become his bride.

245
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,960
Knowing this actually helps.

246
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,919
That wretch!

247
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,440
Your fighting spirit is back.

248
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,840
Let's turn Youzhou

249
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:35,320
upside down,

250
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,679
making Li Ya'er

251
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,159
rest in chaos.

252
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,320
Xuanzhi.

253
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:42,399
I'm tired.

254
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:43,639
You go rest first.

255
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,440
Alright.

256
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:46,759
Get some rest then.

257
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,559
Xuanzhi.

258
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,360
Leave me a blade.

259
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:57,279
What for?

260
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,879
