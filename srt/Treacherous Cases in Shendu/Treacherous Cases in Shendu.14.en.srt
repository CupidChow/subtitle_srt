Xuanzhi.

00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:02,679
Good to see you.

5
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,248
Ling.

6
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:07,719
You've lost weight.

7
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,840
I'm commissioned

8
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:13,879
to escort you to Youzhou.

9
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:16,400
Thank you.

10
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,519
This is my fault.

11
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:22,000
It's not your fault.

12
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,920
I was just born unlucky.

13
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:26,840
Ling.

14
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,959
What else can I do for you?

15
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:31,439
You've done

16
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,120
more than enough for me.

17
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,159
I'm taking you home.

00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:07,120
Xuanzhi.

20
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:09,159
You haven't fully recovered.

21
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,759
You don't have to take this job.

22
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,840
Are you denying me the chance

23
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,719
to atone for my sins?

24
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,520
You owe her nothing, Xuanzhi.

25
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,560
Now I know how Ling felt

26
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:23,680
when she learned

27
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,960
my true identity.

28
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,240
We were betrayed by someone

29
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:29,879
we truly cared for.

30
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,639
Have you ever truly cared for me?

31
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:38,680
You only care about her.

32
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,039
Have you cared

33
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:41,680
about your family

34
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:44,360

that a crow's feathers

are actually colorful?

69
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:16,959
Yet people misunderstand them

70
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,439
and depict them as black.

71
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,759
Just say the word,

72
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:26,920

I can't leave.

Don't worry about your family.

76
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,800
I'll get them out.

77
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,360
Seeing you like this

78
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:40,759
is worse than death to me.

79
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:43,680
No.

80
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,600
I won't leave.

81
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,279
I must go to Youzhou

82
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,879
to see where he was born.

83
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,319
Why didn't you kill me?

84
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:00,560
What would you do

85
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:03,399
if it were you?

86
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,120
I want you to live.

87
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,920
It's the same for me.

88
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:12,680
I also want you to live.

89
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,279
I can no longer offer you love.

90
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,040

91
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:28,480
I... love him.

92
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,360
But I can't bear to hurt you.

93
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:45,519
We must both live well.

94
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,039
Who are you?

95
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:34,159
If you were to die now,

96
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,639
any last words?

97
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,159
Are you

98
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,000
from Jinlouzi?

99
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,759
Or from Youzhou?

100
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:43,639
How did Li Ya'er die?

101
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:46,759
I don't understand.

102
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,480
Li Ya'er is in Shendu.

103
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,840
Lying even at death's door.

104
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,639
If she gets so much as a scratch,

105
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,200
I'll tear you apart.

106
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,480
Ya'er.

107
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,080
Li Ya'er, wake up.

108
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,799
Ya'er, wake up.

109
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,799
Ya'er, you're scaring me.

110
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:01,879
Ya'er.

111
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,720
Ya'er.

112
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,200
You woke up.

113
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,600
Ling.

114
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:14,560
Come on.

115
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,679
Are you hurting?

116
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,600
I'm fine now.

117
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:31,559
I'm fine.

118
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,440
Sun Er's medical notes

119
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,600
are remarkably accurate.

120
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,080
When the blade goes between the ribs,

121
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,519
it may look fatal,

122
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,120
but it actually misses all vital organs.

123
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:55,320
Ling.

124
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,320
Ling.

125
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,679
We made it.

126
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:04,120
I was so scared.

127
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,159
I thought you might actually die.

128
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,919
I don't mind dying

129
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,559
in your hands.

130
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:15,808
No.

131
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:18,360
Let's never

132
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,279
use this trick again, okay?

133
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:24,679
We've been

134
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:26,320
manipulated all this time.

135
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,080
Without muddying the waters,

136
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:30,879
we can't gain the upper hand.

137
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:33,120
I promise we won't

138
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,279
do this again.

139
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:45,480
Does it hurt?

140
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,200
Not at all.

141
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:49,120
The pain's long gone.

142
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,759
Are you alright?

143
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:56,879
I'm fine.

144
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:00,480
I was just terrified.

145
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:12,559
It's fine.

146
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,080
It's over.

147
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:15,879
It's fine now.

148
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:18,840
Don't cry.

149
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,360

00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:31,799
