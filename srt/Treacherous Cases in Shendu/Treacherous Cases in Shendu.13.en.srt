00:00:45,075 --> 00:00:47,840
(Treasure Map)

2
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,960
This paper must be made
of special materials.

3
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,280
The flame

4
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,280
reveals its secret.

5
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:01,119
The creator was

6
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:02,200
truly thoughtful.

7
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:05,079
If others obtained this treasure map,

8
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:06,480
they'd treasure it and keep it

9
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,560
away from fire.

10
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:09,959
Thus, they'd never discover

11
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:11,239
the secret.

12
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:17,400
Show yourself.

13
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:28,359
Ling.

14
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,760
Hand over the painting.

15
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,519
I'll explain everything to His Majesty.

16
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,879
You're also his informant?

17
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:36,879
You think

18
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,480
His Majesty

19
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,280
only assigned Xuanzhi to watch you,

20
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:42,319
without sending someone to watch him?

21
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,640
I won't give it to you.

22
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:45,840
Wu Lingling, you're heartless.

23
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:47,959
Don't you realize

24
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,040
that if Li Ya'er takes this painting,

25
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:52,640
Xuanzhi will be convicted of deception?

26
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,480
He's so nice to you.

27
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,799
How could you let him die?

28
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,879
I'll go with you.

29
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:03,640
Let Li Ya'er go.

30
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,200
He can't leave.

31
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,359
I won't leave.

32
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,439
But you can't stop me

33
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,680
from taking Ling away.

34
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:13,479
That's right.

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,960
I'm no match for you.

36
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:16,840
That's why I've sent someone

37
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,319
to have tea with the Dowager Consort.

38
00:02:22,868 --> 00:02:28,096
=Treacherous Cases in Shendu=
=Episode 13=

39
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,800
Brilliant.

40
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:35,719
The late Empress was indeed thoughtful.

41
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:37,280
The secret of this treasure map

42
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,360
(Treasure Map)
remained unsolved for decades.

43
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:40,039
It turns out

44
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:42,439
that we must

45
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,240
put it to the flames.

46
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,439
In the end,

47
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,639
only someone from
the Wu family could uncover the trick.

48
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,199
You could have asked for the treasure.

49
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:54,879
Why hurt the innocent?

50
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,759
Save this question for Lord Wu.

51
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:03,159
Had he not been so stubborn back then,

52
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:04,560
this treasure

53
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,639
would've been mine already.

54
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,400
And Li Huaixian wouldn't dare

55
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:11,360
act so recklessly now.

56
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,080
The treasure map marks

57
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,400
12 burial sites.

58
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:18,439
But the markings are unclear.

59
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,599
Only the Jinlouzi agents
know the details.

60
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,840
I'm afraid your efforts

61
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:24,400
may prove futile.

62
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,319
I don't know the details.

63
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:34,360
But during the post-road coup years ago,

64
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:37,800
your father controlled Jinlouzi.

65
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,199
He once

66
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,520
retrieved part of the treasure.

67
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:45,759
And his most trusted confidant

68
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:48,120
was Li Huaixian.

69
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,520
Li Huaixian

70
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,840
betrayed your father later,

71
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:56,919
but managed to defeat the rebels

72
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:00,319
precisely with those treasures.

73
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,479
So with this map in hand,

74
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,439
he'll have no choice

75
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,639
but to cooperate with me.

76
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,879
So you used my sister

77
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:11,080
to gather information.

78
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,360
Fate was cruel to her.

79
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,080
She was willing to serve

80
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,519
and lacked the means.

81
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:18,920
Fortunately,

82
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,439
Lord Wu

83
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,920
has two daughters.

84
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,560
I won't help you.

85
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,079
You are exactly

86
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,279
like your father.

87
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,279
Years ago,

88
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,959
I gave your father

89
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,560
two options.

90
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,199
Help my new master seize the throne,

91
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,639
or perish.

92
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,600
Today,

93
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,160
I offer you two choices, too.

94
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:52,800
Ling.

95
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,120
One deceived His Majesty.

96
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:08,000
The other shall lose his entire family.

97
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,839
It's your call.

98
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:11,279
Among these two,

99
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,399
only one can be saved.

100
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:17,519
If you have a problem with me,
come at me.

101
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:18,759
Why hurt the innocent?

102
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,839
How could I bear to kill you?

103
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:24,439
Your mother

104
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,720
is still waiting for you.

105
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,399
Don't get her into this.

106
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,720
I know.

107
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:31,839
I don't want to make things

108
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:33,600
difficult for you, either.

109
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:37,600
But I'm giving you a chance now.

110
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:39,639
Their lives

111
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:42,160
rest entirely

112
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,160
in your hands now.

113
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,160
Treasure map.

114
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:36,040
Alright.

115
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:14,000
Ling.

116
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,360
I did everything willingly.

117
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:20,959
I won't blame you.

118
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,519
You've protected me since childhood.

119
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:27,600
Every request I made,

120
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:29,480
you fulfilled.

121
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:30,839
Every wish I had,

122
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,560
you granted.

123
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:34,519
Other than my father,

124
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,600
you're the kindest person
to me in the world.

125
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,800
How could I bear to kill you?

126
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,439
Ling.

127
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:54,016
Ling.

128
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:08,160
Ya'er.

129
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,639
Any last words for me?

130
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:20,720
Li Ya'er.

131
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:26,759
I love you.

132
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:29,759
Ling.

133
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,560
Ling.

134
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:00,960
My lord.

135
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:02,200

This time,

150

you'll accompany
the princess to Youzhou.

151
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,159
You must

152
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:53,799
keep close watch on her.

153
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:55,960
Understood.

154
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:09,519
Your Highness,

155
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:12,240
you're shouldering grave responsibility.

156
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:15,200
You won't forget, right?

157
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:17,480
Take the map to Li Huaixian.

158
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,559
Find the treasure.

159
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,639
If necessary,

160
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,240
kill Li Huaixian.

161
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,279
What if Li Huaixian

162
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:29,759
asks about Li Ya'er?

163
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:32,919
Li Ya'er has been made
General of Agile Cavalry

164
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,120
to remain in Shendu

165
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,960
and eradicate Jinlouzi.

166
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,919
Over the past month,

167
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,440
we've been forging
Li Ya'er's handwriting

168
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:47,159
and corresponding with Youzhou.

169
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,519
They didn't suspect anything.

170
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:52,840
As long as you act prudently,

171
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:55,240
the operation

172
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,679
won't be exposed.

173
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:58,120
And please don't

174
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,679
hold grudges against me.

175
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:01,080
I did all this

176
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,600
only to spare

177
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,600
Tang from the ravages of war.

178
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,759
