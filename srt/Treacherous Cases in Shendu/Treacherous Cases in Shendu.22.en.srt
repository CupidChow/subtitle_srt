1
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:23,439
Li Ya'er.

2
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:25,920
You have anything else to say?

3
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,000
Li Ya'er is guilty of incest

4
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:29,079
and patricide,

5
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:30,840
and shall be beaten to death

6
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:31,920
as a warning to all.

7
00:01:35,104 --> 00:01:40,640
=Treacherous Cases in Shendu=
=Episode 22=

8
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:45,799
Ling.

9
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,400
Ling.

10
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:49,760
You woke up.

11
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:56,159
Where is Xuanzhi?

12
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:21,199
Ling.

13
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:22,400
Just now,

14
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,400
the imperial physician took your pulse.

15
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,000
You're pregnant.

16
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:30,240
What?

17
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:31,360
It's true.

18
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:32,879
It's been two months.

19
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,879
Let me check on Xuanzhi first.

20
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,360
It's too late.

21
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:45,680
The Shadow Guards sent us a message.

22
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,960
Li Huaixian died in Youzhou.

23
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,240
The "killer", Li Ya'er,

24
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,240
will be executed tomorrow at noon.

25
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,039
This is the imperial token

26
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:01,120
His Majesty gave me earlier.

27
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:03,159
It can mobilize nearby troops.

28
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:04,439
Go save him.

29
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:07,360
I won't go.

30
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,479
I'll check on Xuanzhi.

31
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,919
Xuanzhi is dead.

32
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:15,520
Think about those who are alive.

33
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,319
You're not alone.

34
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:18,400
You're carrying a child.

35
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,520
What will you do

36
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:24,400
if Li Ya'er dies?

37
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:28,000
Will you let everything
Xuanzhi did for you

38
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,120
end up in vain?

39
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,879
Ling.

40
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,159
Please let me be willful one last time.

41
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:52,919
Let me stay

42
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:55,439
with Xuanzhi alone a bit longer.

43
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,344
(Token)

44
00:04:14,752 --> 00:04:17,920
(Token)

45
00:04:21,376 --> 00:04:26,400
(Token)

46
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,360
(Xuanzhi.)

47
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,800
(I'm leaving.)

48
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:34,120
(Rest assured.)

49
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,120
(I will find the real killer)

50
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,680
(and avenge you.)

51
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:44,360
Hyah!

52
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:55,439
Xuanzhi.

53
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:57,360
It's so dark.

54
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:00,839
I can barely see you clearly.

55
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:22,800
Beat him to death.

56
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:04,360
Who's there?

57
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:49,920
Ya'er.

58
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,439
Ya'er.

59
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:54,839
Ya'er.

60
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,240
Wu Lingling.

61
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:57,600
You dare come back?

62
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,519
Why wouldn't I?

63
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,240
I've done nothing wrong.

64
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,879
You and Li Ya'er murdered Father.

65
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,839
Today, you shall be executed.

66
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:07,160
(Token)
Here is the imperial token.

67
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:08,839
I've surrounded Youzhou with troops.

68
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,720
You'd better stay put

69
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,399
or you shall die.

70
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,759
You agreed to the marriage

71
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,720
only to capture Youzhou, didn't you?

72
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:17,120
Even if I die here today,

73
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,360
I won't let you succeed.

74
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,639
Shadow Guards.

75
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:21,439
- Here.
- Here.

76
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,560
Those who obstruct

77
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,199
the investigation of Lord Wuwei's death

78
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,800
shall be executed.

79
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,360
Ya'er.

80
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:37,240
Ya'er.

81
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:02,159
I just found out.

82
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:04,759
It's been two months.

83
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:27,039
Xuanzhi is dead.

84
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:30,840
I couldn't even attend his burial.

85
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,399
If you die too,

86
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,120
what will I do?

87
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,360
What will our child do?

88
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:24,799
Wu Lingling.

89
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:26,000
My father's dead.

90
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,159
What else do you want?

91
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,200
To find out the cause of death.

92
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:31,480
You want your brother dead,

93
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,480
but not the truth?

94
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:33,759
My father died from

95
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:34,799
fighting Li Ya'er.

96
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:35,759
That's the truth.

97
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,039
You know your father's

98
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:38,080
martial prowess.

99
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:39,840
How would he get exhausted

100
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:41,399
from a single fight?

101
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:42,559
Unless he had injuries

102
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:44,200
or was poisoned.

103
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:48,120
Ling.

104
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,559
I've checked.

105
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,279
Father truly died from fatigue.

106
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:54,639
No matter what,

107
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,080
I'm the primary cause

108
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,600
of Father's death.

109
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,559
Then who severed his head?

110
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,960
Don't you want to know?

111
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:02,440
Li Ya'er.

112
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:04,200
I know you feel guilty.

113
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,159
But if we let the real culprit

114
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:07,120
get away with it,

115
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:08,480
you'll betray

116
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,799
your father's final wishes.

117
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:21,679
Coroner.

118
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,799
Thank you.

119
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:24,799
