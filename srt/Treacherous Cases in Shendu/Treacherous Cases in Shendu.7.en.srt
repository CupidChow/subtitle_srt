1
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,039
Waiter!

2
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:40,840
My guests,

3
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:41,679
this way.

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,479
Please.

5
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:43,000
Okay.

6
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:43,960
Here.

7
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,840
This way, please.

8
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:49,600
Sit.

9
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:55,399
May I know

10
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:57,359
if you're lodging or dining?

11
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,479
Both.

12
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,560
Four deluxe rooms.

13
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:01,640
Apologies.

14
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:03,039
Only two rooms remain.

15
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:03,920
Perhaps,

16
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,239
you could share?

17
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:11,319
Can you free up one more room?

18
00:01:11,392 --> 00:01:12,319
I want to live alone.

19
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:13,920
Sir,

20
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,079
we're packed today.

21
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:16,879
Just two rooms left.

22
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,840
Take them then.

23
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:20,280
Bring us some

24
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:21,280
signature dishes.

25
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,040
Coming soon!

26
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,200
One moment.

27
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,040
Signature dishes!

28
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,680
Bad luck.

29
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,400
Enough.

30
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,000
Stop sulking.

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,159
Exactly, Xuanzhi.

32
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:32,239
You've shared a room before.

33
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:33,280
Silence.

34
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:35,239
It is perilous here.

35
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,480
I'll stay awake

36
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:37,760
and guard your door.

37
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,879
You're so cunning.

38
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,120
Using a clever trick now?

39
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,719
Pretending not to resent me,

40
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:47,040
while playing hero

41
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,640
before Ling.

42
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:49,879
Then you'd

43
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,439
guard her door.

44
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:53,000
I'll go sleep.

45
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:53,480
I...

46
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:53,879
Enough.

47
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,159
Grow up, men.

48
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,799
Enough, Xuanzhi.

49
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,959
You'd better shut up.

50
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,359
Stop getting tangled

51
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:00,400
in his words.

52
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:17,240
What's wrong?

53
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,159
The device's moving.

54
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,800
Jinlouzi must be close.

55
00:02:22,131 --> 00:02:27,360
=Treacherous Cases in Shendu=
=Episode 7=

56
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,560
Signature dish is here!

57
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,639
Here is

58
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,759
the signature dish.

59
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:46,319
Enjoy.

60
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:48,280
What?

61
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:49,199
You startled me.

62
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,479
What's this?

63
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,479
Serve us this?

64
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,879
Listen to me.

65
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:58,719
This is our signature dish.

66
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:00,639
We eat this ourselves.

67
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:01,280
You're lying.

68
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:03,159
Why don't they have it?

69
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:04,960
Sir,

70
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:06,400
he speaks true.

71
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:07,560
We eat this.

72
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,719
Please enlighten us.

73
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,159
This town's at the border of Youzhou.

74
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:12,639
After the barbarian invasion,

75
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:13,479
it had years

76
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:14,879
of war

77
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:15,840
and famine.

78
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:17,960
Grain is rare here.

79
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:19,560
Exactly.

80
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,840
Thank you for telling us.

81
00:03:23,936 --> 00:03:24,896
The court ignores it?

82
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,400
Forget the court.

83
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:27,719
Here is beyond any rule.

84
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,000
Not Youzhou,

85
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,400
the court,

86
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,240
or even the locals.

87
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:35,800
We noticed upon arrival

88
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,240
white lanterns and coffins

89
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,680
at every house.

90
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,159
What's this about?

91
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:43,319
It's a story from a year ago.

92
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,439
Plague was

93
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,520
ravaging the town.

94
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:46,960
And no cure existed.

95
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:49,560
Many died mysteriously.

96
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,039
Then a dark-robed Taoist came.

97
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:53,919
He can conjure

98
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,840
and heal the sick.

99
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,520
And he knows

100
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:58,039
immortal arts,

101
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,800
resurrecting the dead.

102
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,080
This dark-robed Taoist

103
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,479
would visit patients' houses
to treat them at night.

104
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,039
Gradually, the town began to recover.

105
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:08,319
(Six months ago,)

106
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:09,639
(the Taoist demanded us)

107
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:11,280
(to build a temple for him.)

108
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,240
(And when someone's sick,)

109
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,319
(Memorial)
(just place a coffin at the door,)

110
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:17,199
(and put the patient inside.)

111
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:19,439
(Envoys would carry it up the mountain.)

112
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,160
How many people cured then?

113
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:29,000
About half.

114
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,279
How about the dead?

115
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,759
Just let them be.

116
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,040
Who'd dare to retrieve?

117
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,360
But some claimed they saw

118
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,759
the immortal taking the dead to heaven.

119
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,839
Nonsense.

120
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,360
Then why told me to tell?

121
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:49,839
People here are annoying.

122
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,800
Why hasn't she come yet?

123
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,879
No idea.

124
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:22,600
Coming.

125
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:30,199
Why are you here?

126
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:31,000
What are you up to?

127
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:31,879
Talk later.

128
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:32,879
Why so late?

129
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,199
We've been waiting.

130
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:35,439
Got the money?

131
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:36,839
Let us see the child.

132
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:00,920
Let's go.

133
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:01,720
Go.

134
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,519
Child trafficking.

135
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:23,680
This is an inn,

136
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,480
not a temple.

137
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,519
The temple lies ten lis east.

138
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,040
I'm talking to you.

139
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,000
Are you deaf?

140
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,279
She's dead!

141
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,839
(Immoral trafficker deserves to die)
Murder!

142
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,160
Murder!

143
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,680
Murder!

144
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:42,839
Murder!

145
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,720
Carry her away.

146
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:48,199
Yes.

147
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:48,759
Yes.

148
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,040
My lord.

149
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,360
Idiot!

150
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:55,399
Useless!

151
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:57,519
Can't you support me?

152
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:10,360
Where's the innkeeper?

153
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,560
My lord,

154
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,120
the innkeeper got held up

155
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:15,240
by family matters.

156
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:16,800
You

157
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,600
discovered the body and reported it?

158
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,759
Yes.

159
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:21,560
The deceased was a guest here.

160
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:23,279
When I opened the door,

161
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,759
she was kneeling there.

162
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:27,279
The post is remote.

163
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,680
The killer must be among your guests.

164
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:30,240
Someone.

165
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:30,800
- Here!
- Here!

166
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,279
Arrest them all.

167
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,399
Make them confess.

168
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:33,839
- Yes.
- Yes.

169
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:34,600
My lord, wait.

170
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,240
You are...

171
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:41,800
She's also a guest here.

172
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,839
Arrived yesterday.

173
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:44,279
Did I ask you?

174
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,519
Mind your tongue.

175
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:48,240
You just said

176
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,600
to arrest all guests here?

177
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,519
For a lady like you,

178
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:56,480
exceptions can be made.

179
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,920
If you obey me,

180
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,600
I won't...

181
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:01,800
You!

182
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,279
Ya'er.

183
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:03,000
What do you want?

184
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,759
Behave.

185
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,439
Forgive him.

186
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,759
He's my guard.

187
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,319
We mean no offense.

188
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:10,319
For her sake,

189
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:12,360
I'll let you off today.

190
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:21,000
State your names and origins.

191
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,480
If you tell lies,

192
00:08:22,784 --> 00:08:23,720
you will be arrested.

193
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:25,720
My lord,

194
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,560
I'm Qin Ye from Chang'an.

195
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,839
We're here to find

196
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,439
lost relatives.

197
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,480
Jue Yuan, Ascetic monk.

198
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,480
Just passing through.

199
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,039
Amitabha Buddha.

200
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:39,559
And you?

201
00:08:40,832 --> 00:08:42,039
A constable from Chang'an,

202
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:42,960
Yan Shiqi.

203
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:44,960
I'm here on official duty.

204
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:46,639
Mr. Guo from Luoyang.

205
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:47,919
To look for someone

206
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:49,200
skilled in worm sorcery.

207
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,399
This is my wife.

208
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:52,440
My cousin

209
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:53,519
is upstairs,

210
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:54,519
surnamed Zhao.

211
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:56,000
Probably still asleep.

212
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,039
It's already noon.

213
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:58,919
Yet she's asleep?

214
00:08:59,240 --> 00:08:59,480
Go.

215
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,960
Ask everyone to get down here.

216
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:28,679
How is he?

217
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:31,039
He hasn't spoken since last night.

218
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:43,080
Are you hungry?

219
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,720
Eat if you're hungry.

220
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,639
Boy,

221
00:09:55,552 --> 00:09:56,879
do you know this cloth-wrapper?

222
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,720
Why did

223
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,799
your mother sell you?

224
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,399
Is she

225
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,120
your mother?

226
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,159
Keep talking.

227
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,720
After our child went missing,

228
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:29,799
we've been worried sick day and night.

229
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,200
Finally, we got a lead

230
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:33,559
and went all this way here
to pay the ransom.

231
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:37,480
Mr. Qin,

232
00:10:38,272 --> 00:10:39,240
what's your son's name?

233
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,720
How old is he?

234
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:41,600
My Lady,

235
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,480
my son is named Qin Lang,

236
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:44,960
about six years old.

237
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,159
That woman brought

238
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,559
a child yesterday.

239
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:50,360
Why didn't you just cry for help,

240
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:51,840
but stay silent?

241
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,879
Our child's been missing for two years.

242
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,039
We couldn't

243
00:10:58,279 --> 00:10:59,240
be certain

244
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:00,639
and kept identifying.

245
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:02,399
With a huge sum of money

246
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,960
in this unfamiliar place,

247
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,480
we know no martial arts.

248
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:06,639
My lady,

249
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,840
I had to be cautious.

250
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:12,080
Yet that trafficker took our money

251
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:14,360
and tried to silence us.

252
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,000
How did you escape?

253
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,159
Where is the child?

254
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,840
That woman tried to kill me,

255
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:22,279
but somehow

256
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:24,039
she fled in fear.

257
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,720
Then the child disappeared.

258
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,000
Her accomplice

259
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,720
must take the child

260
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,600
while we were struggling.

261
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,480
By coincidence,

262
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,080
I went out for food last night

263
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:41,840
and found your child.

264
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:44,919
He's in my room now.

265
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:52,039
My lord.

266
00:11:59,240 --> 00:11:59,960
Wonderful!

267
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,159
The child has a birthmark
on his right hand.

268
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,200
Go check

269
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,200
and confirm it.

270
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,080
Thank you so much.

271
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,320
We can't thank you more.

272
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,200
Go check on him.

273
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:22,720
Exactly.

274
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:23,399
Exactly.

275
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,000
This is my child.

276
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,080
My child's arm

277
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,039
has a birthmark.

278
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,720
You're not his parents at all!

279
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,519
Didn't you say

280
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:33,759
this was their child?

281
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:35,159
The birthmark matches.

282
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:36,240
Indeed.

283
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:36,960
I recognize

284
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,919
this birthmark.

285
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,559
Actually,

286
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:40,879
this birthmark

287
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,919
was drawn this morning.

288
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:44,039
It can be wiped off.

289
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:49,159
This...

290
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,799
So eager to take the child?

291
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:52,639
Tell us.

292
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:53,879
What's your game?

293
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,399
I saved you yesterday.

294
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,480
I can still kill you now.

295
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:05,879
Husband.

296
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,120
Let go!

297
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:07,879
Let go!

298
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,039
Husband.

299
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,080
Husband.

300
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,080
Husband, are you okay?

301
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:16,960
Come.

302
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,559
Get up.

303
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:18,159
Come.

304
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:28,799
Who's there?

305
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:29,679
Come out.

306
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,440
You vicious!

307
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,159
You traffic children,

308
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,520
and even steal from your own?

309
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,039
I was doing good.

310
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,559
That child was abandoned in the temple.

311
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,480
I just found him a loving family.

312
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,039
Temple?

313
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,559
I found him from a coffin

314
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:47,759
in the temple.

315
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:48,919
If not for me,

316
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,200
he'd have died long ago.

317
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,639
Without me,

318
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,519
he would've died soon.

319
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,480
That kid is sick.

320
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:56,279
He won't make it.

321
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,960
Then why sold him to that couple?

322
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,039
They're seeking a child.

323
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,679
They need a child.

324
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:03,279
I need money.

325
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,120
Why not?

326
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,480
Then why tried to kill them

327
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,399
after the deal?

328
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,440
- I'll talk.
- I'll talk.

329
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,200
- I'll talk.
- I'll talk.

330
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,559
- My lord, we'll talk!
- We'll talk!

331
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:33,120
We'll talk.
