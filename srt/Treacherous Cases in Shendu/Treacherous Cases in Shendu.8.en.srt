1
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,960
(Memorial)
I got the money.

2
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,039
Where's the child?

3
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,880
Give me the money.

4
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,359
You'll see the child.

5
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,159
I haven't seen him.

6
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,280
How can I tell if he's worth it?

7
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,359
Meet

8
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,000
at the post three days later.

9
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,880
Ensure he was born
on the sixth day of the seventh month,

10
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:04,959
and just turned six?

11
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,000
If he's not born on the same date,

12
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:08,519
I won't accept him.

13
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,359
Exactly.

14
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,519
Bring the money

15
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:12,640
when we meet.

16
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,200
Mr. Immortal,

17
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,480
I am not committing evil deeds.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,439
My child has an incurable illness.

19
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:26,519
We need the organs of two children born

20
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:27,280
on the same date

21
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,159
for treatment.

22
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,319
If my child recovers,

23
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:32,040
we two

24
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:33,519
will fast to repay you.

25
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,280
Bless us.

26
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:37,519
Bless us, please.

27
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:38,640
Bless us, please.

28
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,680
Bless us.

29
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:41,000
Bless us.

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,799
Bless us, please.

31
00:01:42,707 --> 00:01:48,256
=Treacherous Cases in Shendu=
=Episode 8=

32
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,200
Are you even human?

33
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,760
How can you sacrifice

34
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,480
two innocent children for your own?

35
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,879
You are completely vile.

36
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,959
Well... That's utterly ruthless!

37
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,239
My lord,

38
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,319
we had no choice.

39
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:08,479
Our child is so young.

40
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:09,800
Do you know

41
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,719
what torment he endures?

42
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,120
A witch doctor gave us the prescription.

43
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:20,080
It's our last hope.

44
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,360
Even if we'd be condemned,

45
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:24,960
we won't let our child die.

46
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:26,319
Witch doctor?

47
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,400
What witch doctor?

48
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:29,680
A witch doctor wearing a dark robe

49
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,560
gave us this prescription.

50
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:33,759
That's why we came here.

51
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,120
Why that trafficker

52
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,479
tried to

53
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:40,599
kill them?

54
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:43,000
Panpan.

55
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:51,159
What's this?

56
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,000
We found shoes from that trafficker's

57
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
cloth-wrapper.

58
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:56,639
At first, we thought

59
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:57,599
they were the boy's,

60
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,639
but then we noticed

61
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:00,120
embroidered patterns.

62
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,319
That trafficker must have

63
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,240
had a daughter before.

64
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,439
I think after she discovered

65
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,439
that they

66
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:09,439
wanted to harvest organs for medicine,

67
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,840
so her maternal instincts flared up

68
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:13,080
and tried to kill them

69
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:15,080
to stop them from killing the child,

70
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,680
and then escape with the money.

71
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,960
We got the organs.

72
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,599
Our child can be saved now.

73
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:22,800
Then who killed the trafficker?

74
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,830
She's got someone else in on this.

75
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,879
I injured her.

76
00:03:25,888 --> 00:03:26,788
Take off the clothes,

77
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,680
and we'll know.

78
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,199
My lord, wait for me.

79
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:40,120
What's going on?

80
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:42,680
That swordswoman

81
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:44,159
is injured.

82
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,479
Xuanzhi, Ya'er.

83
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,560
Go after her.

84
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,120
Panpan,

85
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,840
stay and take care of the child.

86
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:14,280
You ambushed me last night?

87
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:15,240
What did you say?

88
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,560
Stop pretending.

89
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:18,680
Why did you run away?

90
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,920
Why attacked that monk?

91
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,560
That fat monk attacked me.

92
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,920
(Constable)
I'm a constable,

93
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:26,439
to arrest a trafficker.

94
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:31,240
When I was checking
on the trafficker's corpse,

95
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:33,079
the monk suddenly attacked me.

96
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:35,399
I thought there's only one trafficker,

97
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,360
but there are actually two.

98
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:45,360
The monk didn't go upstairs.

99
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:49,759
How did he know

100
00:04:50,432 --> 00:04:51,488
I injured the accomplice?

101
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,399
Namo Amitabha.

102
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,319
Panpan.

103
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,279
Panpan.

104
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:43,439
What's wrong?

105
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:44,680
Panpan.

106
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:46,639
The child...

107
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,519
Panpan.

108
00:05:54,067 --> 00:05:55,872
(Worm Sorcery)

109
00:06:06,836 --> 00:06:13,499
(Memorial)

110
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:27,000
In Prince Qi's mansion,
I once saw you often.

111
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,920
In Cui Jiu's hall, I also appreciated
your art several times.

112
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,399
Now with Jiangnan's beautiful scenery,

113
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:35,519
we meet again as petals fall around us.

114
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:37,959
Stop the tricks.

115
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,399
Princess Changle,

116
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,639
it's been a long while.

117
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,240
Why are you alone?

118
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:02,639
Where's my lady?

119
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:03,959
Her Highness

120
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,360
left this object behind

121
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:07,360
and claimed to pursue that monk.

122
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,600
What?

123
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,519
Where did she go?

124
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:12,720
No idea.

125
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,920
Her Highness said

126
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,000
if you return,

127
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,680
follow the markers she left behind.

128
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:18,959
Mr. Guo,

129
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,839
your cousin is injured.

130
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:32,279
Are you looking for them?

131
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:34,319
The fat monk

132
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,399
and that female trafficker are partners.

133
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,639
Recently, to swindle
that couple's wealth,

134
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,240
they stole this child from my temple.

135
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:43,439
Now,

136
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,360
they've received due punishment.

137
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:48,480
You must've

138
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,680
made a worm sorcery in him long ago.

139
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:54,439
You're the Worm Sorcerer of Jinlouzi?

140
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:55,959
Smart girl.

141
00:07:58,639 --> 00:07:59,560
You left this token

142
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,519
intentionally, right?

143
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:05,240
Since you know I did it on purpose,

144
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,319
how dare you come here?

145
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,360
Why not?

146
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,839
You killed my sister.

147
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,199
I'll avenge her!

148
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,160
Remarkable.

149
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,040
Ventriloquism.

150
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,480
What do you want?

151
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,879
Made a mistake.

152
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,120
Otherwise,

153
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,639
you'd never have detected me.

154
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:54,879
Why did you kill my sister?

155
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:56,519
Your sister would've died anyway

156
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:57,679
after marrying into Youzhou.

157
00:08:58,639 --> 00:08:59,440
Right,

158
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:01,799
Li Ya'er?

159
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:05,960
Nonsense!

160
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:08,600
Li Ya'er.

161
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,759
You've indeed lost your memories.

162
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,792
Li Ya'er came in his father's stead

163
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:19,240
to protect the Princess.

164
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,759
Why would he kill her?

165
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,399
Wu Lingling.

166
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,519
Do you want to know
how your father died?

167
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:29,200
Just say it.

168
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:30,879
Stop beating around the bush.

169
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,200
Fifteen years ago,

170
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,600
the Crown Prince utilized rebel forces

171
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,840
to stage a military coup,

172
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,120
trying to seize power.

173
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,120
Lord Wu attempted
to aid the late Emperor with Jinlouzi,

174
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,159
and obtained
some treasure from Jinlouzi.

175
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:45,639
But Li Huaixian's betrayal
caused his death.

176
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,120
Later,

177
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,879
Li Huaixian used that treasure

178
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,360
to eliminate the rebel forces,

179
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,519
securing his position
as Governor of Youzhou.

180
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:03,000
The Phantom Slash is really amazing.

181
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:05,879
I wonder if Lord Wu

182
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,000
also died by this very technique?

183
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,240
Used corpses to breed worms?

184
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,879
Only human flesh can breed

185
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,279
the most potent worms.

186
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,600
Today,

187
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:25,039
I'll show you what they can do.

188
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,000
Leave.

189
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,720
I know it.

190
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:47,440
The worms track us by scent.

191
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,320
What to do?

192
00:10:55,508 --> 00:11:01,534
♪Stormy tides engulf the realm,
yet compassion remains♪

193
00:11:02,501 --> 00:11:08,500
