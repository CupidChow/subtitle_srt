1
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:50,799
Ling.

2
00:00:55,479 --> 00:00:55,960
Ling.

3
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:58,159
Ling.

4
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,320
Ling.

5
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:02,240
You dare show your face?

6
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,840
Let me explain.

7
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,200
They look so much like you.

8
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,480
Still trying to deny it?

9
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:10,200
But they aren't my children.

10
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,640
The point is that I'm a...

11
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,879
W-What?

12
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:14,319
A wretch, right?

13
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:15,280
I...

14
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,480
I-I'm still...

15
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,519
I'm pure.

16
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:18,400
Prove it.

17
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:19,439
Prove it?

18
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,200
Fine.

19
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,480
I'll prove it.

20
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:24,560
Come on.

21
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:26,040
Please come verify.

22
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,079
You!

23
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:28,200
Li Ya'er!

24
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,359
You are shameless!

25
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:32,560
I'm shameless?

26
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:34,599
You slander me.

27
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,000
Today I could be the wretch,

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,280
not even a human anymore.

29
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,319
But I can't let you

30
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:40,519
stay up all night upsetting.

31
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:42,040
I don't care about shame

32
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,239
or reputation.

33
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,239
Come on.

34
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,200
Come on.

35
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,480
Li Ya'er, why are you shameless?

36
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:50,079
If I weren't shameless,

37
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,319
how could I deserve you?

38
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,000
I want to see how jealous you can be.

39
00:01:58,599 --> 00:01:59,200
Get up.

40
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:02,599
You!

41
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,240
Get up.

42
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:12,599
Get off my bed.

43
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:14,560
Get up.

44
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,360
Get up.

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,520
Alright, I'm getting up.

46
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,199
Not angry?

47
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,039
Cool your temper.

48
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,439
Rage hurts.

49
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:33,039
Tell me.

50
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:34,479
Coming here so late,

51
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,840
did you find something?

52
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,599
I went to see those two children.

53
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:41,759
I discovered

54
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:44,159
(the nanny caring for them)

55
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,879
(pricked their toes with needles)

56
00:02:47,399 --> 00:02:48,159
(to collect blood.)

57
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:02,719
Then why did they claim
they're your children?

58
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:06,319
To divert suspicion, perhaps.

59
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,400
I'm rarely in Youzhou anyway.

60
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,560
Having two children isn't surprising.

61
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:12,560
I suspect

62
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,199
those two children

63
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:16,120
might be members of Jinlouzi,

64
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,400
or their descendants.

65
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,240
Half a year ago,
I was told to go to Shendu.

66
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:25,000
My father secretly instructed me

67
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:26,240
to try every means

68
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,919
to lure out the Jinlouzi.

69
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,560
If I can't bring them back alive,

70
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:34,159
I must retrieve their corpses.

71
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:35,280
So I believe

72
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:36,879
this matter

73
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:39,680
must relate to the Jinlouzi treasure.

74
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,560
Remember what

75
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,240
the Worm Sorcerer said?

76
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,120
He said my sister would die

77
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:51,240
in Youzhou.

78
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,599
Ling,

79
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:58,879
I swear

80
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,680
I'll do everything

81
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,159
to protect you

82
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:03,560
and your sister.

83
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:15,560
Go back now.

84
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,160
Where to?

85
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,600
To where you sleep.

86
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:29,160
I'm so tired.

87
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,519
My lady,

88
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:39,279
I'm so tired.

89
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,160
Let me stay awhile.

90
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:48,672
=Treacherous Cases in Shendu=
=Episode 16=

91
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,392
Master, we only need
the princess's blood

92
00:04:51,392 --> 00:04:52,600
to complete the 12 Jinlouzi.

93
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,639
My cause is near success.

94
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,639
You've worked hard.

95
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,519
Serving you

96
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,519
is my honor.

97
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:21,759
Who's there?

98
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,879
Xuanzhi.

99
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,240
Can I come in?

100
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,120
Are you going
to assassinate Li Huaixian?

101
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:44,199
None of your business.

102
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,240
Your swordsmanship is superb,

103
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,839
but if you want to assassinate

104
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:48,839
Li Huaixian,

105
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,600
I'm afraid your Ling
will end up dead too.

106
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:55,399
Are you threatening me?

107
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:03,079
Do you resent me that much?

108
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,560
If it weren't for you,

109
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,120
things wouldn't have come to this.

110
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,519
If not for my intervention,

111
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:10,439
things would've been
beyond saving long ago.

112
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,399
I hate wise fools.

113
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:18,079
What do you want?

114
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,319
I am fulfilling your wish.

115
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:32,839
I have adored you since childhood.

116
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,800
My every thought has been of you.

117
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:36,720
I know you'd do anything

118
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,000
for Ling.

119
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:40,120
I am the same.

120
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:42,240
Everything I've done

121
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,040
is to protect you and the Guo family.

122
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,040
Can't you see that, Xuanzhi?

123
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,000
But I don't love you.

124
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:55,879
Wu Lingling doesn't love you either.

125
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:57,360
But I love her.

126
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,360
Between Li Ya'er and me,

127
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,800
she chose me to live.

128
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:03,639
She doesn't love me.

129
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,920
But I have to stay with her.

130
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,279
What if she doesn't need you

131
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:13,360
to stay with her?

132
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:16,680
What do you mean?

133
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,920
Come with me to watch a good show.

134
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,399
Say something.

135
00:07:57,985 --> 00:07:58,465
What?

136
00:07:58,959 --> 00:07:59,959
You only talk

137
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,279
after everyone finds out?

138
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:04,680
Xuanzhi.

139
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,160
I'm sorry.

140
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,680
Everything happened suddenly.

141
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,000
That's why I thought

142
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,600
to let Li Ya'er fake his death

143
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,279
and take the initiative.

144
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,560
They used the method of feigning death

145
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,319
described in medical texts.

146
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,639
How did you know?

147
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:23,680
If I hadn't guided you

148
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,160
to read those medical texts

149
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:26,680
to find a cure,

150
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:27,600
would you even

151
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:29,079
read them?

152
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,960
I heard

153
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,000
you found your sister?

154
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,919
How is she?

155
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,600
Her health hasn't improved.

156
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:37,840
She's unconscious.

157
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:40,519
Maybe we should consult Mr. Sun.

158
00:08:40,608 --> 00:08:42,144
(He's a descendant of Medicine God.)

159
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,000
(The prescription)

160
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:45,159
(he provided cured me.)

161
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,440
Ling.

162
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:54,080
Read this.

163
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,039
The method of feigning death?

164
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,000
Why are you showing me this?

165
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,440
Ever since I arrived in Shendu,

166
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,440
we've been led around

167
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,360
by the mastermind.

168
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:10,799
We must take

169
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:11,960
the initiative.

170
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,559
This method is too risky.

171
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,360
High risk means high reward.

172
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,039
It's feasible.

173
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:32,679
Panpan, you...

174
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,279
Ling.

175
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,320
I wasn't ordered to do so by the court.

176
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:37,960
I'm jealous of

177
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,559
Xuanzhi's affection towards you,

178
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:41,960
but I'd never harm you.

179
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:44,840
Royal authority, wealth,

180
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,039
status, or money.

181
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,279
None of these matters

182
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,279
compared to Xuanzhi's safety.

183
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,200
If I hadn't exposed you,

184
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,480
my lord

185
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,080
would never spare any traitors.

186
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,519
You knew all along

187
00:09:56,919 --> 00:09:57,840
that Li Ya'er is alive.

188
00:09:58,159 --> 00:09:58,759
Yes.

189
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,240
I kept it a secret

190
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,960
because only in Youzhou

191
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,200
could we shake off the court's spies.

192
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:04,960
Besides,

193
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:08,200
I selfishly hoped

194
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,919
Xuanzhi could stop loving you anymore.

195
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,279
Very well.

196
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,200
What an excellent play.

197
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:26,600
All of you kept me in the dark.

198
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,039
What do you take me for?

199
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:32,960
A fool?

200
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:36,840
Ling.

201
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:39,279
We've grown up together.

202
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,320
Twenty years together,

203
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,240
yet I remain an outsider.

204
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Someone who's never truly touched you.

205
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:55,120
No.

206
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,840
I was wrong.

207
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,600
I've wanted to tell you.

208
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,360
But I didn't want to drag you into it.

209
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,559
I fear you'd be implicated.

210
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:10,120
Alright.

211
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:12,840
I'm the one who got hurt the worst.

212
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:15,679
Xuanzhi almost killed me.

213
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:36,600
Panpan.

214
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:40,480
I'm sorry.

215
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,639
I've wronged you.

216
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,440
It's not that serious.

217
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:52,840
However,

218
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,720
since we've now realized

219
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,679
who matters most to each other,

220
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,000
let's stop hiding our true feelings.

221
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:01,960
After we settle all these,

222
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,440
let's go live in peace together.
