1
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:47,280
That bed

2
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,799
was already old.

3
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:50,280
Just leave it broken.

4
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,280
No need to fix it.

5
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:52,840
Granny.

6
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:55,520
We've been staying
at your place for a while.

7
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,679
We'll feel bad

8
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,560
if we don't do something for you.

9
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:00,840
Your man

10
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,960
is truly nice,

11
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:03,600
with a handsome face

12
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,359
and strong physique.

13
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,799
He also treats you well.

14
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,640
Granny,

15
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,319
actually

16
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:13,239
we're not married.

17
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,680
But I still

18
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,040
can tell

19
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:18,760
he genuinely cares for you.

20
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,560
Really?

21
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:22,159
I can see it from the way

22
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,480
he looks at you.

23
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,359
Every time he looks at you,

24
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,599
his eyes overflow
with tenderness and affection.

25
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,120
That can't be faked.

26
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,480
But we won't end up well.

27
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,200
Our families...

28
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:52,719
When I first saw you two that day,

29
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,239
I could immediately tell

30
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,400
that you two could
share hardships together.

31
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:58,239
Life is short,

32
00:01:58,519 --> 00:01:59,959
and a good partner is rare to find.

33
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:02,439
Don't let social status

34
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:04,519
or prejudice chain you.

35
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,840
Life is unpredictable.

36
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:08,680
Cherish the one who's around you.

37
00:02:22,036 --> 00:02:27,744
=Treacherous Cases in Shendu=
=Episode 11=

38
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:41,800
They are really suspicious.

39
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:43,319
Must have evil plans.

40
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:53,919
No breath,

41
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:55,800
yet skin remains supple.

42
00:02:56,512 --> 00:02:57,728
They aren't ordinary corpses.

43
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:00,439
What kind of technique

44
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:01,960
could suppress breathing

45
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,000
and heart beating?

46
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,054
Turtle Breath Technique.

47
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,639
But it only works briefly.

48
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,919
They seem

49
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:12,360
connected to the worm sorcery.

50
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,159
Why not

51
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:17,680
just play along?

52
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,200
Teach me the technique.

53
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,039
Alright.

54
00:03:37,376 --> 00:03:39,360
Not a single valuable.

55
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,560
This job is killing me.

56
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:55,680
Hurry.

57
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,319
No signs of life,

58
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,560
but still alive.

59
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,199
Why are they gathering so many zombies?

60
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,240
That day,

61
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,240
after you left, Jinlouzi ambushed me.

62
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,879
(The dead gong soldiers)

63
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,040
(attacked me
like puppets under control.)

64
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,639
Jinlouzi must be using

65
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:35,480
their puppet skill

66
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:37,319
to manipulate corpses for killing.

67
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:38,560
Puppet skill?

68
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:39,456
Exactly.

69
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,360
Miaojiang

70
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,920
not only excels at worm sorcery,

71
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,319
but also the puppet skill.

72
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:45,000
To control puppets to kill,

73
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:45,920
yet the one

74
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:47,399
can lurk in shadows.

75
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:50,639
Ling.

76
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,079
Could your sister

77
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:53,879
have been controlled too?

78
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:57,824
Someone's here.

79
00:05:58,772 --> 00:06:01,472
(Lord Wu's Mansion)

80
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,519
She had been controlled.

81
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:17,839
Ling,

82
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,839
I have a guess.

83
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:21,759
What is it?

84
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,360
Puppet masters can control corpses,

85
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,480
but corpses

86
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:27,839
can't speak.

87
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:29,920
If I recall correctly,

88
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,839
before your sister set off,

89
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:33,439
she bid farewell
to the Princess Consort.

90
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:36,040
You mean, she isn't my sister?

91
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:42,319
I got it from the Black Market.

92
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,759
If this corpse is truly her,

93
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,319
then mixing it

94
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:48,000
with your blood in water

95
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:49,160
won't change color.

96
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:51,232
But

97
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:55,879
I need a piece of her remains.

98
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:41,120
Your Highness,

99
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:42,399
we found this

100
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:43,560
in your sister's carriage.

101
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,720
Calcium carbide residue.

102
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,199
What?

103
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:51,879
When exposed

104
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:53,959
to water, it releases a gas

105
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,240
that can be ignited
in specialized lamps.

106
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,079
We mainly use it

107
00:07:58,079 --> 00:07:58,839
for coal mining

108
00:07:59,079 --> 00:07:59,879
and lighting.

109
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:01,319
And it's

110
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:02,480
brighter than candles

111
00:08:03,008 --> 00:08:04,096
and harder to extinguish.

112
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,519
On that day your sister set off,

113
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,759
a fire burned down the carriage.

114
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,600
Perhaps it's caused

115
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:14,079
by the calcium carbide
beneath the carriage.

116
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:21,399
(We also found the coachman)

117
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,759
(had needles in his body)

118
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:23,839
(and got Worm Poison.)

119
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:29,399
Your sister might have been switched

120
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:30,589
before boarding the carriage,

121
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:33,440
so Di Long came to steal the corpse

122
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,240
to cover their scheme.

123
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,240
You mean,

124
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,399
my sister might still be alive?

125
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,528
Ling.

126
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:48,159
Xuanzhi.

127
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:49,792
Ling.

128
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,519
Wonderful!

129
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,559
You're back.

130
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,080
What's wrong?

131
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:55,559
Are you okay?

132
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,320
Xuanzhi,

133
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:58,960
you look so worn out.

134
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,840
Since you disappeared,

135
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,080
I couldn't eat or sleep.

136
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,600
Don't leave me again

137
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:03,960
or take such risks alone.

138
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,120
Okay.

139
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:05,919
I understand.

140
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,519
Mr. Guo,

141
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,000
we're in public.

142
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:12,000
That's enough.

143
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:13,919
It's all your fault.

144
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,360
Where did you put Ling?

145
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:16,639
I was so worried.

146
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:17,320
What?

147
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:19,799
You seem perfectly energetic,

148
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:20,799
even hugged my lady.

149
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:22,279
And,

150
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:23,720
I didn't kidnap her,

151
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:25,399
but saved her.

152
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,639
And you.

153
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:27,279
Got it?

154
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:29,759
Why shouting at me?

155
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,759
What do you want?

156
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,080
Enough!

157
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,639
Can't you two talk in peace?

158
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,360
Xuanzhi,

159
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:38,720
how's Panpan?

160
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:39,919
She's fine.

161
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,399
Rest and medicine will do.

162
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:43,232
Good.

163
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,120
I'm glad then.

164
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:45,216
By the way,

165
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,039
when I came here,

166
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,480
I saw official notices

167
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,399
claiming your sister was kidnapped.

168
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,464
What happens?

169
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,879
We've examined

170
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,000
and discovered

171
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:54,759
the corpse isn't my sister.

172
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:55,320
Really?

173
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:56,720
She's still alive?

174
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,200
Not sure.

175
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,679
But we're sure

176
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:00,960
that's not her corpse.

177
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:02,679
Thanks to Wu Ya'er

178
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,840
for discovering this.

179
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,360
The notices might

180
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:09,679
alert the mastermind.

181
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:11,200
That's what we want.

182
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:13,440
The mastermind swapped the princess,

183
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:14,960
wanting to hide the truth

184
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,000
that she's still alive.

185
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,519
Now everyone knows it.

186
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:19,240
Then he has to do something.

187
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,679
No need to lure him out.

188
00:10:24,467 --> 00:10:26,240
(Prescription)

189
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:26,840
I've

190
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,240
targeted him.

191
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:57,919
The time has come.

192
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:00,320
Farewell.

193
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,320
This is Mr. Sun's house?

194
00:11:11,715 --> 00:11:13,695
The Worm Sorcerer is
a descendant of Medicine God.

195
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:15,240
We'll know

196
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,840
who he is exactly.

197
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:20,200
A descendant
of the renowned Medicine God

198
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:21,960
also became a member of Jinlouzi?

199
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:23,960
Interesting.

200
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:30,000
I am Sun Huairen.

201
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,080
May I ask why you're here at my place

202
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,320
at this hour?

203
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:38,360
Is it your family's secret recipe?

204
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,639
Well...

205
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,200
How did it end up in your possession?

206
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,519
A Sun

207
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,840
has been cultivating worms

208
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:49,519
and attempting
to kidnap Princess Qingping.

209
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,039
Mr. Sun.

210
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:52,759
Know who that is?

211
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:56,080
Well...

212
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,120
You're finally here.

213
00:11:58,039 --> 00:11:58,840
Sun Er!

214
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:00,840
You beast!

215
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,320
What have you done?

216
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:04,399
You're not a member of the Sun family!

217
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,120
When have you ever treated me as one?

218
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,879
Locking me away in that dark yard

219
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:13,600
for over twenty years.

220
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:16,000
Who even knows I'm a Sun?

221
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,759
I should never have shown mercy.

222
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,240
I should have strangled

223
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:22,200
a freak like you at birth.

224
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:25,000
Now you've caused such massive trouble.

225
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,536
I...

226
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:27,240
I'll kill you.

227
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:29,360
If you'd strangled me,

228
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:31,240
I would thank you,

229
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,200
Father.

230
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,799
You can kill me in an instant.

231
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,399
But you've spent over twenty years
tormenting me!

232
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:38,279
If not for me,

233
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,480
you and my brothers

234
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:42,279
would never have enjoyed

235
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:43,600
all those years of fame.

236
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:45,600
Are you merciful?

237
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
You are hypocritical,

238
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,399
greedy, and shameless!

239
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:51,000
You monster.

240
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,679
Let my sister go.

241
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,639
Release Princess Qingping

242
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:55,519
and I'll spare you.

243
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:57,879
The Guo family

244
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:00,279
truly controls the Tiance Army.

245
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,080
The Emperor

246
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,320
really does favor you Guo family.

247
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:17,504
Father.

248
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:20,720
Let me fulfill your final wish.

249
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:22,639
I've repaid you

250
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,399
