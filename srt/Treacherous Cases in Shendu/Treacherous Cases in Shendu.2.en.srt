1
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:42,144
A covert organization of 12 agents
established by the late Empress

2
00:00:42,144 --> 00:00:45,184
monitored officials
while amassing wealth,

3
00:00:45,184 --> 00:00:49,950
which was later managed by
the Jinlouzi agents after her passing.

4
00:00:54,227 --> 00:00:58,304
(Palace Sedan Painting)

5
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,240
Turn in the Jinlouzi agents.

6
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,920
I'll make it painless.

7
00:01:04,544 --> 00:01:05,384
Where's the painting?

8
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:07,000
(Jinlouzi?)

9
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:07,840
Ling.

10
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,040
What is this?

11
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:17,680
I took this painting

12
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,599
from Li Ya'er.

13
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,439
The man in black

14
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:22,640
was also after this painting.

15
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,959
What is Jinlouzi?

16
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:25,959
I've heard about it.

17
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,200
I'll look into it.

18
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:27,719
Right,

19
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,120
why are you keeping

20
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:30,920
that stranger around?

21
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,040
He might help me

22
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,280
find my sister's murderer.

23
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:35,439
With him

24
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,319
and this painting by my side,

25
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,799
the killer will surely show up.

26
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:42,239
You're using him as bait?

27
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,239
No.

28
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,480
I'm using him as a blade

29
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,120
to eliminate all my enemies.

30
00:01:52,052 --> 00:01:57,888
=Treacherous Cases in Shendu=
=Episode 2=

31
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:15,960
Xuanzhi.

32
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,080
Where have you been?

33
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,560
I've missed you so much.

34
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:21,879
Xuanzhi.

35
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:22,439
Stop training

36
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:23,800
your chest muscles.

37
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:25,199
They're so bulky now.

38
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:28,400
Panpan.

39
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,280
What are you doing?

40
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:33,400
Xuanzhi?

41
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,319
So, you...

42
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,479
(Zhao Panpan)

43
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:36,400
Who are you?

44
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:38,439
Why are you in my cousin's clothes?

45
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,919
I'm sorry.

46
00:02:41,216 --> 00:02:42,880
He took advantage of me.

47
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:43,960
Panpan.

48
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,080
How could you

49
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:46,520
mistake him for me?

50
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,520
I'm way more handsome.

51
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,560
Ling.

52
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,960
Don't be lured by his looks.

53
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,039
You can't keep him around.

54
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,080
Since you're working for me,

55
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,080
from now on,

56
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,479
you'll obey my rules.

57
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:21,039
First,

58
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:23,159
address me as "my lady" in public.

59
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:24,120
Second,

60
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:26,120
since you had nowhere to go

61
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,000
and I took you in,

62
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,800
you should protect me

63
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,879
and my family.

64
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:31,280
Third,

65
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,719
always obey my orders.

66
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:34,960
You will do

67
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:35,879
whatever I say.

68
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:37,520
Otherwise,

69
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:39,080
I'll kick you out.

70
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:40,360
Understood?

71
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,639
Understood.

72
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,199
My lady.

73
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,160
My lady.

74
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:27,959
Why...

75
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:28,879
Why are you here?

76
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,639
What did you dream about?

77
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,439
I...

78
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,199
I...

79
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:46,879
dreamed...

80
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:51,680
Just answer

81
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:52,800
my question.

82
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,600
I dreamed

83
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:58,759
that I killed many people.

84
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,639
Who did you kill?

85
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,199
My lady.

86
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:12,639
I'm scared.

87
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:14,600
About what?

88
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,959
That I'm an evil person.

89
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,240
That I might harm you.

90
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,240
Stop overthinking.

91
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:24,480
Right now,

92
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,480
you're Wu Ya'er.

93
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,879
Take your medicine.

94
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,240
It's over there.

95
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,519
I feared the dark

96
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:43,240
when I was little.

97
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:47,120
My sister stayed with me at night.

98
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:50,279
Later,

99
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:52,639
she gave me a puppy.

100
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,399
It may be small.

101
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:57,600
But the moment we took it home,

102
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,240
it became our family.

103
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,120
It will grow with you

104
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,680
and protect you forever.

105
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:04,480
So adorable.

106
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:06,279
What's its name?

107
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:07,959
Ling, give it a name.

108
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:09,600
Got it.

109
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,839
Let's call it Naughty.

110
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:11,480
Naughty.

111
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,600
Behave yourself.

112
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,399
No biting.

113
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:14,480
No potty here.

114
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,519
Do you understand?

115
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,519
Ling.

116
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:17,319
It's a dog.

117
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:18,560
It doesn't understand you.

118
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,480
Woof.

119
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,120
Woof, woof.

120
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,879
Woof, woof.

121
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:23,480
Sadly, we fled Chang'an

122
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,360
without it.

123
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,000
I lost it.

124
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:30,079
My lady.

125
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,839
Don't be sad.

126
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,279
If you fear darkness,

127
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:36,759
I'll guard you every night

128
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:37,600
from now on.

129
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,399
If you miss Naughty,

130
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:43,040
just look at me.

131
00:06:44,659 --> 00:06:49,639
♪Darkness looms with impending doom♪

132
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:51,120
Your eyes kind of

133
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,720
remind me of that puppy.

134
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:02,624
Woof.

135
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,279
Woof, woof.

136
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:10,752
Woof.

137
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:17,879
Who's there?

138
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:20,879
Palace Sedan Painting.

139
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:21,800
Watch out.

140
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,319
Are you okay?

141
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:46,759
My lady.

142
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,839
What's wrong?

143
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:49,920
Who are you really?

144
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,160
I don't know.

145
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:54,040
I told you

146
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:55,439
not to lie to me.

147
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:56,680
I'm not lying.

148
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:58,879
Turn around.

149
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:14,560
You bear the Qidan tattoo.

150
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,040
You're from Qidan.

151
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,600
What...

152
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,480
What tattoo?

153
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,439
I have no idea.

154
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,639
Only Qidan people have this tattoo.

155
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:42,919
Li Ya'er is from Qidan, too.

156
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:44,799
You came from Youzhou.

157
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,919
Li Ya'er.

158
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:58,279
You saved my life

159
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:01,360
and gave me hope,

160
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,679
yet named me after your enemy.

161
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:09,799
Why?

162
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,639
My life is yours to take.

163
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:14,440
If you think I'm your enemy,

164
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,799
just kill me.

165
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:33,799
Don't move.

166
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,639
Someone's outside.

167
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:07,960
He died?

168
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,480
What happened?

169
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,200
We caught him trying to steal

170
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,240
my sister's remains.

171
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:12,879
Xuanzhi.

172
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,080
What happened?

173
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:17,840
Who is this man?

174
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:21,639
He looks

175
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,240
quite familiar.

176
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:25,840
You know him?

177
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:28,000
Isn't he the Judicial Minister

178
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,440
from Qingqing's wedding?

179
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:30,919
I've seen him.

180
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,080
This fragrance.

181
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:11,759
He died a while ago,

182
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,360
but there's no stench.

183
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:15,679
His blood even carries
a subtle fragrance.

184
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,360
This fragrance

185
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,159
persisted against

186
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:20,200
natural decay.

187
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:24,480
It's...

188
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,039
- Poison.
- Poison.

189
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,480
Ling.

190
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:28,480
My lady.

191
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:31,639
Found anything?

192
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,320
Judicial Minister's remains

193
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:35,799
carry a rare poison.

194
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:37,039
Poison?

195
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,679
This unique toxin

196
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:40,240
is from the Western Regions.

197
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,720
It's been

198
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:43,039
in his system for a while

199
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,519
and broke out yesterday.

200
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,039
This must be

201
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,159
a premeditated act.

202
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:50,000
So he was stealing my sister's remains

203
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:51,440
to hide something bigger.

204
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:07,759
My lady,

205
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:08,559
stop drinking.

206
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:10,320
You're drunk.

207
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,799
I can't sleep

208
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:15,799
without drinking.

209
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,000
The moment I close my eyes,

210
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:22,559
I hear my sister's agonized screams.

211
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:37,279
May I call you Ling from now on?

212
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:48,200
You...

213
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:53,919
Say that again.

214
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,048
May I...

215
00:12:58,048 --> 00:13:00,440
call you...

216
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,720
Ling?

217
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:31,072
Have it.

218
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,240
This will help with

219
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:33,559
the hangover.

220
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,639
You helped me to bed?

221
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,879
You remember?

222
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:44,399
Nothing on Qingqing's remains.

223
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:46,399
But we found a major clue.

224
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:49,840
What are you doing?

225
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:52,799
Having tea.

226
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,919
It's early morning. Why did you come?

227
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,720
The Judicial Minister turns out

228
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,039
to be a Jinlouzi,

229
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:08,200
code name Di Long.

230
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:13,919
These were seized from his residence.

231
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,039
They don't look like

232
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,480
ordinary treasures.

233
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,320
And they bear

234
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:27,960
engraved inscriptions.

235
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:29,799
Recognize them?

236
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:36,080
Burial objects.

237
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,279
You recognize them?

238
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:48,159
So he

239
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:49,279
tried to steal the remains

240
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,519
for some other reasons,

241
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:52,039
not money.

242
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:54,639
Xuanzhi.

243
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:55,720
What's this?

244
00:14:56,799 --> 00:14:58,080
This is the poison

245
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:58,759
that killed him.

246
00:14:58,759 --> 00:14:59,440
Immortal's Ecstasy.

247
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:00,720
It's from a wine house

248
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:01,960
called Zuixian Tower

249
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,559
owned by the Hu people.

250
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:09,919
