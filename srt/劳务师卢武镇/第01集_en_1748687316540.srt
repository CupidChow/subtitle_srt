1
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,539
Machine 2!

2
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:41,624
Machine 2 is fine, right?

3
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,126
Right?

4
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:46,087
We need to crank out twice as much today.

5
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:50,383
Machine 1 is down,
and it's being a nuisance.

6
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:51,885
Got it?

7
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:56,181
Hey! Watch where you're going!

8
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,154
You good?

9
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,949
Hey, Nimal! Get your act together!

10
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:17,702
This is exactly why
the machine keeps malfunctioning!

11
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:22,165
And you are?

12
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:25,543
Goodness.

13
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,340
Safety sensor broken,

14
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:32,675
helmets not worn,

15
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,844
and the two-person rule
completely ignored.

16
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:36,679
Clearly,

17
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:39,849
you don't care about
the Occupational Safety and Health Act.

18
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,351
I mean, wow.

19
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:45,146
How is a factory like this
still around in the 21st century?

20
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:48,441
So I'm asking you, who are you?

21
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,945
A labor attorney just passing by.

22
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:53,863
What's that?

23
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,659
A noble profession serving those who toil.

24
00:01:57,742 --> 00:01:59,869
An advocate
who stands up for working people.

25
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:05,542
Not only do I provide legal advice
to protect workers' rights…

26
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:06,918
To protect workers' rights?

27
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,170
As a licensed professional

28
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:12,966
offering labor law, management, HR,
and social insurance consulting,

29
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:16,302
legal work and representation in hearings
for business owners…

30
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:17,220
Whatever.

31
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:22,433
So what exactly
is a labor attorney like you doing here?

32
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:24,894
Are you the safety manager?

33
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:28,106
No. We don't have anything like that.

34
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:32,443
Right, so you don't have
a designated safety manager either.

35
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:37,157
It looks like you employ
more than 50 people here,

36
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,160
so that will be a five-million-won fine.

37
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,619
Five million? Chief.

38
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:44,706
Chief?

39
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,749
So you're the supervisor here.

40
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,918
As you have failed to perform

41
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:52,171
the occupational safety and health duties
required of a supervisor,

42
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,549
that will be
an additional five-million-won fine.

43
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:57,594
Five million won? Me?

44
00:02:58,344 --> 00:02:59,512
I'm just wondering.

45
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:02,098
The person I saved earlier

46
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:04,934
isn't here illegally, is he?

47
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:09,022
No, of course not.
Don't even say stuff like that!

48
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:11,149
No, no.

49
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,318
Don't get me wrong.

50
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:17,155
I'm here to help you
before things get out of hand.

51
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:18,531
Think about it.

52
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:21,534
If he'd been hurt,
that would've been awful.

53
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:22,452
You met me…

54
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:47,268
2 YEARS AGO

55
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,441
Mu-jin,

56
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,110
how long have you worked here?

57
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:59,656
Ten years this year.

58
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:03,076
Right, you were a new hire
when I'd just become a senior associate.

59
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:05,578
Oh, right.

60
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,289
Do you remember
your new employee orientation?

61
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,668
You said you'd bury yourself here.

62
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:14,254
Why would I do that?
This isn't a cemetery.

63
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:16,464
I was immature back then.

64
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:18,925
You seem worse now.

65
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,594
I don't get it. Tell me.

66
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,763
What's your real reason for quitting?

67
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:28,268
Well…

68
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:35,566
I'm just not happy.

69
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:40,321
Wow… Okay.

70
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,741
You're not happy?

71
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:46,077
Listen.

72
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:52,208
When I look out the window,
this is what goes through my mind.

73
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,628
"I'll die instantly if I fall from here."

74
00:04:58,214 --> 00:04:59,590
This doesn't open.

75
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,721
Oh, it doesn't?

76
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:10,768
Did they replace it
because too many jumped?

77
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,899
Do you have something lined up?

78
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:26,701
I'm asking you to reconsider
because it's you.

79
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:30,830
Once you're out there,
you'll miss having a steady paycheck.

80
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,167
Okay.

81
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:55,438
How did it go?

82
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,607
He was pretending to be all considerate.

83
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:01,194
Something about how
I'll miss having a steady paycheck.

84
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:02,904
That's because he's never left.

85
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,617
A steady paycheck
won't buy you a car like this.

86
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:13,748
- Right?
- Of course.

87
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:17,668
Salaries will never beat
investment income.

88
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:22,465
Your severance pay is enough seed money,
so just leave everything to me.

89
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:25,510
I'll take you somewhere
you've never been before, my friend.

90
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:29,514
Friend?

91
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:34,060
Brother. I'm counting on you, my brother.

92
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,353
Let's go!

93
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,113
Oh, wow.

94
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:48,366
Whoa.

95
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,286
Slow down, brother.

96
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:02,547
Hey, slow down. You're going too fast.

97
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:09,846
Hey.

98
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,391
Hey, you're going way too fast.
This is dangerous!

99
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:14,642
Wow.

100
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:16,936
You'll get us killed, damn it!

101
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:19,105
You can only die once, not twice.

102
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:21,816
Hey!

103
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,979
You must've been close with Jeong-min.

104
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:20,917
By the way,
was Mr. No that close with Jeong-min?

105
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,793
That's not why he's crying.

106
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:24,587
Then why?

107
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:32,470
Jeong-min quit to invest in crypto,
got wiped trading futures, then croaked.

108
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:36,098
He got Mu-jin to quit too
and blew all his severance pay.

109
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:39,560
I'm worried he might end up dying too.

110
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:40,811
He probably will.

111
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,523
If his wife finds out.

112
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,066
His wife?

113
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,237
She found out he blew all that money,
and now they're separated.

114
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:52,406
I'd file for divorce, not just separate.

115
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,951
His wife's a lawyer, isn't she?

116
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,744
Oh, you're here.

117
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,914
Hey, Mu-jin. It's been a while.

118
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:08,506
It's the people you know
you need to be careful of.

119
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:12,301
Seriously, you quit your job
just to do crypto?

120
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,221
Not just crypto. Futures too.

121
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,765
What will you do now?

122
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:18,975
Do you have a plan?

123
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,435
Like he would.

124
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:25,690
All right.

125
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:27,900
Then be a labor attorney.

126
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,113
A labor attorney?

127
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:33,781
Where did that come from?

128
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:37,034
It has good prospects,
and they're in demand these days.

129
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,037
It's a specialized profession.

130
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,956
It's stable. No retirement age.

131
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:44,500
Isn't the exam pretty hard?

132
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:46,711
You have a law degree.

133
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:49,297
Civil law, civil procedure, labor law…

134
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:53,009
A lot of it overlaps and you're smart,
so you'll pick it up quickly.

135
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:57,221
So think of it as your last shot
and just go for it.

136
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,349
If you pass, I'll bring you into HR.

137
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,269
Why would I do that
when I can go to law school?

138
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:04,186
Law school?

139
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:07,356
Will your wife cover the fees
for three years?

140
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,736
Let's be realistic here.

141
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:13,112
In my view,

142
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:17,617
getting that license and returning to work
is your best option.

143
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:19,535
Trust me.

144
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,536
He's right.

145
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,332
If you get that license,
your wife might come back home, thinking,

146
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:27,043
"My immature Mu-jin
is finally getting it together…"

147
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:30,087
Knock it off.
When I say something, I mean it.

148
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:33,049
That's true. You always follow through.

149
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,801
First, quitting, then the crypto.

150
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:39,680
No one's as gutsy as you
when it comes to wrecking your own life.

151
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,518
Yeah, you just quit without a clue
about what you were doing.

152
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:49,857
I should've knocked some sense into
you both and stopped you from leaving.

153
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,233
Like they would listen.

154
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,985
Are you kidding me?

155
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,445
Oh, hey! You leaving?

156
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,822
I'm gonna go. See you.

157
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:04,497
How much?

158
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,166
What?

159
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:10,753
If I come back with that license,
how much money will I get?

160
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,672
If it's a lot, I'll do it.

161
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:15,216
Honestly.

162
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,968
You still haven't learned, have you?

163
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,141
When will you grow up?

164
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:29,647
You promised.

165
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:31,899
Get that license first.

166
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:45,579
A nosebleed.

167
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,086
Just a runny nose.

168
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:58,926
Can I pay?

169
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,054
Oh, right.

170
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:19,029
- Mr. No Mu-jin?
- Here.

171
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:32,293
NO MU-JIN

172
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:35,546
CONGRATULATIONS ON PASSING
THE CERTIFIED PUBLIC LABOR ATTORNEY EXAM

173
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:44,972
<i>The manager quit.</i>

174
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:48,601
<i>He went drinking</i>
<i>with an employee who came for advice,</i>

175
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,978
<i>and something happened there.</i>

176
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:54,273
<i>The victim posted about</i>
<i>the sexual harassment internally, so…</i>

177
00:12:57,693 --> 00:13:00,738
It's nice to be
a licensed professional, huh?

178
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,907
You get to be drunk at this hour.

179
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:06,535
I just can't catch a break.

180
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:11,499
How could Cheol-yong do that
to a female employee?

181
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,000
Not a female employee.

182
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,044
A male one.

183
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:23,719
I'm doing this because it's you.

184
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,766
How did my life get so messed up?

185
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:30,476
You did it to yourself.

186
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:33,229
You think
everyone makes money from crypto?

187
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:36,815
Does everyone with a license
get employed just like that?

188
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:40,277
How did someone like you
even pass the exam? Unbelievable.

189
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,655
You're the one
who was egging me on with him.

190
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:46,033
Who cares about that?

191
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,327
What now?

192
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:52,289
What about the firm
where you did your training?

193
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,585
I was counting on Cheol-yong,
so I made a mess of it.

194
00:13:56,669 --> 00:14:00,589
Wow, seriously.
You can be oddly wild sometimes.

195
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,509
Want to see me go wild?

196
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,059
Hey, how about this?

197
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:14,019
Open up your own practice.

198
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:17,231
And then? Will you bring me clients?

199
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:20,109
Then will you start from the bottom again
at your age?

200
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:22,945
Come on.

201
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:25,906
You didn't quit to do that, did you?

202
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,157
No, I didn't.

203
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:29,118
Seriously, if I were you,

204
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,912
no matter what happens to me,
I'd go for it.

205
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:34,999
And the office? Who's going to pay for it?

206
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:36,876
You lend me money then!

207
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,377
Oh, man.

208
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:42,047
How did you pass the exam in just a year?

209
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,259
Hey, you're a licensed professional.

210
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:51,682
Yeah, so what?

211
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:56,103
Get a loan. It's easy for professionals.

212
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:58,147
Paying back is what's hard.

213
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:05,863
You'll be pushing 50 before you know it.

214
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:08,824
Don't kick yourself afterward.

215
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,784
Don't look back and just go for it.

216
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:15,956
Mu-jin, you've already
hit rock bottom anyway.

217
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,708
Asshole…

218
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,711
Life's a one-shot game!

219
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:23,172
You can only die once.

220
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,343
Not twice.

221
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:37,603
I don't want the salaryman life either.

222
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,563
I envy you.

223
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:42,232
Get off me, you bastard!

224
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,068
Seriously.

225
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:48,155
I'm the one who wants to cry here.
Why are you the one getting wasted?

226
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,157
Don't do it.

227
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,076
Don't.

228
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:56,372
Who gets drunk
and throws up in public anymore?

229
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:00,793
Huh? Wow, who's this?

230
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:04,463
It's the labor attorney, Mr. No Mu-jin.

231
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:10,427
A licensed professional,
unlike a lowly salaryman like me.

232
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:12,763
Let's go.

233
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:16,558
Wow, an advocate for the working people.

234
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:21,438
A labor attorney. That's so cool.

235
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,607
I shouldn't have called him.

236
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,110
Don't do it.

237
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:28,153
Hey, stop it!

238
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,166
I'm sorry.

239
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:44,211
I'm sorry.

240
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:50,759
We're not weirdos or anything.

241
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,513
Well, he is.

242
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,563
I'm a labor attorney.

243
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:08,360
A noble profession serving those who toil.

244
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,947
An advocate
who stands up for working people.

245
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:16,744
A licensed professional.

246
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,289
Dry cleaning fee aside…

247
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:27,087
if you need help
with comp claims or unpaid wages…

248
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,007
give me a call.

249
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:33,427
CERTIFIED PUBLIC LABOR ATTORNEY NO MU-JIN

250
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,597
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

251
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:40,309
Let's go.

252
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:44,730
- What, do you know him?
- Come on, let's go.

253
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,288
LABOR ATTORNEY LICENSE

254
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:02,915
LABOR ATTORNEY NO MU-JIN

255
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,549
This is so heavy.

256
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,054
Hey, boss!

257
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:19,681
Office manager! Please be gentle.

258
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,391
What century do you think this is?

259
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:25,521
You can order all of this online.
Why would you make me go in person?

260
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,731
I don't pay you to lounge around.

261
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:30,859
Just make sure
you pay me on time, or else…

262
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,444
Brother-in-law or not.

263
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,114
Where is that thing?

264
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:36,698
Your business card.

265
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:40,202
I put extra care into making this, okay?
Especially the slogan.

266
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,454
WE RECOVER YOUR UNPAID WAGES

267
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,915
What the heck is this?

268
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:47,042
"We recover your unpaid wages"?

269
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,794
What am I, a debt collector?

270
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:52,714
Look, this is straight to the point
and eye-catching.

271
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:53,924
Got it, boss?

272
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:56,760
You have no chance
if you go plain like everyone else.

273
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:58,846
Take these to your desk.

274
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:04,726
What's with that face?
I went out of my way to make that for you.

275
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,437
- I'm done here!
- Okay, fine.

276
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:11,859
She was just bumming around at home
after graduating anyway.

277
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,443
Bumming around?

278
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,821
You think it's easy
being a content creator?

279
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:20,284
I have to plan content, edit, and film.
I barely have time to breathe.

280
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:22,786
Who would watch a channel
with 500 subscribers?

281
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,746
Five hundred subscribers?

282
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:26,415
You heard that?

283
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:31,128
Let's get one thing straight.
I have 532 devoted subscribers, not 500.

284
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:35,174
And as for yours truly,
I'm in high demand right now,

285
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:39,011
but I've chosen to help a poor soul,
so do this right, okay?

286
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:42,973
And you need to bounce back
and get back with my sister again!

287
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:45,642
I'm about to go crazy
putting up with Mi-joo's temper.

288
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,186
I know.

289
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:50,439
But seriously,
did you really have to pick this photo?

290
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,191
Stop grumbling!

291
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,279
The phone's ringing.

292
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:58,780
Hey, it's yours!

293
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:01,783
- I think it's a client!
- What?

294
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,620
- Hurry up! Take it!
- Okay.

295
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:07,039
- Quickly!
- Okay, fine. Geez.

296
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:11,376
Hello? This is No Mu-jin, labor attorney.

297
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,546
<i>Hey, Mu-jin. It's me, Cheol-yong.</i>

298
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,840
<i>Congrats. I heard</i>
<i>you opened your own practice.</i>

299
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,759
- Who is it?
- Right… Cheol-yong.

300
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:20,552
You're…

301
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:23,013
not doing so well, right?

302
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:25,515
<i>Yeah, you heard?</i>

303
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,434
<i>Things are a real mess,</i>

304
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:31,271
<i>so I wanted to tell you</i>
<i>I'm seriously innocent.</i>

305
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:36,777
<i>You know I can get a little touchy-feely</i>
<i>when I'm drinking.</i>

306
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:40,697
<i>But that's purely out of affection.</i>
<i>It's not like I had any other intentions.</i>

307
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:44,910
If the other person feels uncomfortable,
it's sexual harassment, Cheol-yong.

308
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:46,078
Sexual harassment?

309
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:49,581
<i>Sexual harassment?</i>
<i>Damn it. Did you feel uncomfortable too?</i>

310
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:54,419
No, not me, but everyone's different.
You should've been careful.

311
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,588
And times have changed.

312
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,674
<i>Right, yeah, so…</i>

313
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:02,678
<i>I want to file a claim against the company</i>
<i>for unfair disciplinary action.</i>

314
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:03,679
Oh, really?

315
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:08,475
<i>But I haven't been paid for a few months,</i>
<i>so I don't have any money.</i>

316
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:11,353
<i>- Can you help me first, and once I…</i>
- No money?

317
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:14,773
Our rent's about to become overdue.
The first job is crucial.

318
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:18,193
A freebie from the start?
No way. Don't you dare.

319
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,194
Hang up!

320
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,697
- Right, Cheol-yong.
<i>- Yes, Mu-jin?</i>

321
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:25,659
I'm sorry, but I'm getting a call.
I'll call you back later.

322
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:28,453
<i>I'm telling you, I'm innocent.</i>

323
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:31,790
<i>Come on, you know I'm good for it, right?</i>
<i>How long have we…</i>

324
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:35,002
Is this that new labor attorney's office?

325
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:38,171
I'm here for a consultation. Anyone here?

326
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:41,466
Yes! Yes, have a seat.

327
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,551
- Hang up!
- Cheol-yong.

328
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:46,054
Sorry, but a client just arrived.
I'll call you later.

329
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,098
<i>I see how it is.</i>

330
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:49,099
I said, hang up.

331
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:51,977
- Okay, I promise to…
<i>- Have a good life, asshole!</i>

332
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:59,818
You can't even turn down a call.
He says he has no money.

333
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:02,195
Wow, seriously.

334
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:07,743
Now's not the time
to be gazing out the window, okay?

335
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:11,621
Here, put your jacket on. Let's go.

336
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:14,958
Go where?

337
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:17,461
If they won't come, make them come.

338
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:19,963
It's time to go hustle up some business.

339
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:27,596
So many people.

340
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:30,766
Put on a smile and get moving.

341
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,643
Hi there, we do labor consulting.

342
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:38,899
Is this a person? Huh?

343
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:41,693
Go give it to people!
And stick them in like this.

344
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,739
Hi there, we do labor consulting.

345
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:49,367
Have a look and please give us a call.

346
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,411
Please give us a call.

347
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:55,540
You seem pretty stressed out.
Do call us if you need our help.

348
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:57,542
Who is No Mu-jin?

349
00:22:57,626 --> 00:23:00,212
If you look at the back,
this is our managing attorney,

350
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:01,213
Mr. No Mu-jin.

351
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:05,550
"Unpaid wages, unfair dismissal,

352
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:08,720
minimum wage violation,
unemployment benefits, and more."

353
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:14,601
"We offer clear, practical advice
on all your concerns."

354
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:19,397
Location…

355
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:22,609
Damn it, we can't afford to be picky.

356
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:24,027
"Can travel nationwide."

357
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:25,779
Hello.

358
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:30,575
Oh, hello. I'm a labor attorney.
Please give me a call.

359
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:32,410
Where are you headed?

360
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:34,246
- The restroom.
- The restroom.

361
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:35,413
Total fee.

362
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:36,581
30-MIN CONSULTATION

363
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:44,131
"Discounted to 35,000 won."

364
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:46,007
Do give us a call.

365
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:48,844
Do give us a call. Do give--

366
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:49,845
LABOR FIRM WOOIN

367
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:53,640
Right…

368
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:02,983
Man, it's cold.

369
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:04,985
Here, have a hot drink.

370
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:06,486
Right, thank you.

371
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:09,364
Please give us a call.

372
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:12,200
Right, sure.

373
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,704
Settle your unpaid wages!

374
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:27,841
<i>I still haven't been paid.</i>
<i>I'll report you to the labor office.</i>

375
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:33,096
<i>Going to file a claim for unpaid wages?</i>

376
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:35,765
<i>Hire me.</i>

377
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:37,767
<i>You get a discount.</i>

378
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:43,273
It's cold.

379
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:53,241
Do you need a bag?

380
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:56,995
No bag. Just give me a paper cup.

381
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,789
You need to pay for that.

382
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:01,917
Hey! You think I'm a joke?

383
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:05,086
Just give me one you have left over.

384
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:08,131
You have to buy it yourself.

385
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:13,303
You can just give me one lying around
instead of talking back, you punk.

386
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:17,057
Is this what you call customer service?

387
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:21,770
Take that out of your ear
when a customer's talking…

388
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:24,147
Look at this guy.

389
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:26,066
God damn it.

390
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:27,484
What did you say?

391
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:31,321
Who are you?

392
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:33,740
It looks like life isn't easy for you,

393
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:36,034
and the same seems to apply
to our friend here,

394
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:39,162
so let's not make life harder
for one another.

395
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,835
Fine.

396
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:49,464
I may be drunk, but you're right.

397
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:52,926
Sorry, kid.

398
00:25:56,554 --> 00:25:57,639
Can I go now?

399
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:01,893
Goodbye.

400
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:07,732
Thank you.

401
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,735
I tried it for a few months,

402
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:13,071
and the worst ones
always show up at this time.

403
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:16,241
That'll be 7,100 won.

404
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,494
I'll pay with a coupon.

405
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,381
Do you have any other coupons?

406
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:32,674
Why?

407
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:35,176
We don't accept that coupon here.

408
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:39,389
Oh, really?

409
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:45,061
I left my wallet.
Can I pay for this next time?

410
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:46,688
You know I work just there.

411
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,064
Sorry.

412
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:50,608
Right, I can't really run a tab here.

413
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:52,235
Right.

414
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,741
I'll put them back.

415
00:26:57,824 --> 00:26:58,950
Leave it. I'll do it.

416
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:00,577
No, I can…

417
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:02,829
All right, then.

418
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:11,421
I know you're in there.

419
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:12,756
Huh?

420
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:18,011
I'm going to file for eviction
and clear out all your belongings.

421
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:21,973
So pay all the overdue rent
by the end of the month, okay?

422
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:36,071
NO REQUESTS RECEIVED

423
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:41,618
DISCOUNT RATE 30%
TOTAL FEE 35,000 WON

425
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:21,533
WITH MI-JOO AND PPOKKU

426
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:25,537
<i>Wow.</i>

427
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,704
<i>What are you doing?</i>

428
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:29,624
<i>I need to get this on camera.</i>

429
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:32,794
<i>My Mi-joo is cooking me porridge</i>
<i>because I'm sick.</i>

430
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:34,838
<i>Though the taste…</i>

431
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,174
<i>The taste isn't important.</i>

432
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:40,218
<i>I feel better already.</i>

433
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:41,177
<i>Oh, stop.</i>

434
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,096
<i>Seriously, get lost.</i>

435
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:44,764
<i>Go lie down.</i>

436
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:46,307
<i>Hey,</i>

437
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:49,352
<i>how could you</i>
<i>tell your husband to get lost?</i>

438
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:51,688
<i>Are you sorry or not? Are you or not?</i>

439
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:53,273
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

440
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:57,318
<i>Then can you repeat what you said earlier?</i>

441
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:00,029
<i>Why?</i>

442
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:03,366
<i>So I can watch it whenever I'm tired.</i>

443
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,454
- Just this once.
- Okay.

444
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:12,792
Honey, don't ever get sick again.

445
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:16,629
If you get sick, I get so upset.

446
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:20,800
You know you keep me going, right?

447
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:23,678
Happy?

448
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:27,640
No. Not yet.

449
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:34,230
Oh, seriously.

450
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:40,445
Is life a joke to you?

451
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:44,282
I was only trying to do well.

452
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,327
You tried to do well,

453
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:49,746
so you quit your job
and invested in crypto?

454
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:51,790
And you lost all that money.

455
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:55,001
What do you have to say for yourself?

456
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:57,253
Go on, let's hear it!

457
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,094
I'll do better.

458
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:08,348
I'll make it up to you.

459
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:11,267
Please… Please don't go, Mi-joo.

460
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:14,854
I'll do better.

461
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:18,399
Come here.

462
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:30,662
Mi-joo…

463
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:52,141
Mi-joo?

464
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,142
Help!

465
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,065
Please open the door!

466
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:03,570
Hello?

467
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:15,540
Please help me!

468
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:21,546
I know you're in there!

469
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:46,195
I know you're in there!

470
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:47,947
Open the door!

471
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:53,536
How long are you going to stall on rent?

472
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:58,124
If you keep this up,
I'm seriously taking legal action!

473
00:31:58,207 --> 00:31:59,042
Got it?

474
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:01,461
Damn it!

475
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:10,053
FIRE DREAM MEANING

476
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:15,224
A VERY GOOD DREAM

477
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:17,727
A SIGN OF BUSINESS PROSPERITY
AND GAINING WEALTH

478
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:18,645
It's positive.

479
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:25,568
They're all dead except you.

480
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,988
Thank you for staying alive.

481
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:32,200
You're my last hope.

482
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:35,620
What are you doing?
Why would you water a fake plant?

483
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:40,917
What do you mean a fake plant?

484
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:43,461
This isn't a… It is!

485
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:44,420
Geez.

486
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:48,841
No wonder it stayed alive.

487
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:57,684
- What are you doing?
- Huh?

488
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:59,978
I need to use this somewhere.

489
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:01,854
Sure.

490
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:06,484
Go ahead and sell this too.

491
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,028
Might as well sell this too.

492
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:10,196
Why would I sell that?

493
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:12,615
What else is there? Right. This.

494
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:15,910
And this too.

495
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:18,746
- And…
- What's wrong with you?

496
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,165
This. Sell this too, okay?

497
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:24,210
Put it up for sale online or whatever.

498
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:26,963
We don't have any clients
and we're about to get evicted,

499
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:30,133
so what use is all of this?

500
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:33,177
Even my last hope turned out to be fake.

501
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,514
I should never have started this.

502
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:38,641
Why didn't you stop me?

503
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:40,393
- You're blaming me?
- No, no.

504
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:43,104
I should never have quit my job.

505
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:48,943
Are you crying?

506
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,029
Why would I be crying?

507
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:53,281
You <i>are</i> crying!

508
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,367
- Why are you crying?
- I'm not.

509
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:58,327
It's the hormones.

510
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,289
Once you pass 40, your hormones…

511
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:05,293
You're really embarrassing yourself
in front of your sister-in-law!

512
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:15,636
How's business going?

513
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:22,310
The work's just…

514
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:23,728
flooding in.

515
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,939
And Dad, it's not really a business.

516
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:29,233
It's labor consulting.

517
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:33,154
That's a relief.
Everyone's finding it hard these days.

518
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:35,865
Don't worry about me,
and you worry about yourself--

519
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:41,621
What I mean is I'm more worried about you.

520
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:43,956
You should rest if you're unwell.

521
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:46,834
Don't worry about us.

522
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:50,838
If we stop working,
our bodies will just hurt more.

523
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:55,885
Not me.

524
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:02,558
I'm thankful I can still work at this age.

525
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:05,394
We need to earn every penny
while we still can.

526
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:13,069
So, Mu-jin…

527
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:17,406
I won't be able to this month,
but I'll send you a bit more next month.

528
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:20,409
It's still early days,
so I have a lot of expenses to cover.

529
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,995
It's not that.

530
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:26,541
Are things still the same with Mi-joo?

531
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:48,896
Seriously, where are you taking me?

532
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:52,191
I told you. You'll see when you get there.

533
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:02,785
Hello, big brother. I'm Ko Gyeon-u.
I've heard a lot about you.

534
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:04,370
Big brother?

535
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:06,080
You do look younger than me,

536
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:09,000
but "big brother" is too much
when we've just met.

537
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:11,961
I need an explanation.

538
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:14,547
Why would he call me that?
What's he to you?

539
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:18,134
Hui-joo's family is family to me too.
I'll look up to you as my own.

540
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:21,470
Sorry, but can you cut the crap
and make some coffee?

541
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:22,638
- Sure.
- Yeah.

542
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:33,357
How did you two meet?

543
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:36,485
Oh, well, we met
inside the content creator community,

544
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:38,362
and we do it together sometimes.

545
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:39,322
Do it?

546
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:43,910
Create content together.
What are you thinking of?

547
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:47,580
Oh, that. I was thinking of that too.

548
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,504
Isn't that from our office?

549
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:58,966
Yeah. I gave it to him
because I needed a favor.

550
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:10,811
Hey, what's this?

551
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:14,649
Sound absorbers.
He sometimes does song covers too.

552
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:17,360
- He sings?
- Yeah.

553
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:20,196
I uploaded a duet with him last time.

554
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,157
You didn't subscribe
to my channel, did you?

555
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:26,786
Of course I did. That song was great.

556
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:29,247
Maybe my notifications are off.

557
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:31,707
Here you go.

558
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:38,172
What's your subscriber count?

559
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:40,925
I'll be at a million soon.

560
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:42,301
A million?

561
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:45,471
Yes, I have 950,000 more to go.

562
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:49,892
So, what content do you make?

563
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:52,061
Well, how shall I put this?

564
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:54,855
I share content
that inspires patriotism among our people

565
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:57,608
and promotes our merits to the world
to boost our image.

566
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,028
It's called the halo effect.

567
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:03,823
Some rely on patriotism
to boost their low self-esteem.

568
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:06,367
I create content for those people
and turn a profit.

569
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:07,576
What's he saying?

570
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:10,246
Basically, superpatriotism content.

571
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:12,290
Super what?

572
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:13,457
<i>Did you know</i>

573
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:17,461
<i>that people of the strongest country</i>
<i>on Earth are trying to become Korean?</i>

574
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:22,758
<i>With K-dramas, K-pop, and K-foods</i>
<i>becoming popular by the day,</i>

575
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:24,760
<i>Americans addicted to Korean culture</i>

576
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:29,890
<i>have been flooding the Korean embassy</i>
<i>with demands to be naturalized.</i>

577
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,852
People seriously watch this stuff?

578
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:36,397
It has 700 views already.
In the first 57 minutes.

579
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,357
What use is that, Gyeon-u?

580
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:41,652
Your channel's been demonetized
for spreading fake news.

581
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,656
But the donations are pretty good.

582
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,657
How much?

583
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:50,244
I can order in fried chicken
every other day.

584
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:53,080
Stop…

585
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:56,125
You think that's worth
bragging about? Huh?

586
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:02,798
Why did you bring me here?

587
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,969
After hearing about you, I had an idea.

588
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:07,887
Please sit.

589
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,475
A republic of workplace accidents.

590
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:14,894
That's the unfortunate reality
of our country.

591
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:18,189
But despite this shameful reputation,

592
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:21,359
people don't care,
thinking it has nothing to with them.

593
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:24,987
Forgetting that they themselves
could easily become a victim.

594
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:29,325
So what? You want to create content
about workplace accidents?

595
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:31,535
Will that make money?

596
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:34,622
Big brother.

597
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:36,624
Workplace accidents here

598
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:40,044
are mostly from ignoring safety rules,
not providing protective gear,

599
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:41,670
not installing safety equipment.

600
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:43,047
So how is this an accident?

601
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:44,423
It's human negligence.

602
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:46,384
Complete human negligence.

603
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:49,887
We go to such places,
report them, and get them to change.

604
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:52,640
That's all good, but that's for amateurs.

605
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:58,270
As I said earlier, big brother,
attention equals money.

606
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:00,356
But attention like this is chump change.

607
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:03,526
Some people want to avoid attention
and pay big money.

608
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:05,861
Like who?

609
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:07,696
Who else?

610
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:12,368
Companies without safety gear
that cover up workplace accidents.

611
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,830
You visit those places and offer advice,

612
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:17,915
and if they refuse to cooperate…

613
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:22,378
You film everything and blackmail them.

614
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:25,297
I'd call it a tip-off.

615
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:27,675
- Geez.
- Wait…

616
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,885
I mean, come on.

617
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:31,429
So that was it.

618
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:33,848
You're suggesting we scam these people?

619
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:36,142
Scam? Why would you put it like that?

620
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:38,519
Let's be honest.
What is this if not a scam?

621
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:40,062
Big brother.

622
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:42,731
Do you know how many
small factories we have here?

623
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:44,108
Over 530,000.

624
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:47,111
Of those, how many do you think
have proper safety measures?

625
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:50,197
Don't think so negatively.

626
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:52,992
If you visit those factories
and offer advice,

627
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:55,161
we get clients and prevent accidents.

628
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:56,162
Perfect.

629
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:58,122
Okay, well, fine.

630
00:40:58,205 --> 00:41:02,251
But you think labor attorneys can just
poke around however they want?

631
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:03,544
God, you're frustrating.

632
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:04,587
Look here, boss!

633
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:06,755
Dear brother-in-law.

634
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:09,258
You're all about
sticking to your work ethic.

635
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:10,634
Fine, you do that.

636
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:13,721
But the point we're trying to make is

637
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:17,099
I'm sure there are people
who keep to the rules,

638
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:18,893
but some don't.

639
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:21,729
We go to those people
and scare them a bit.

640
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:23,814
What's so bad about that?

641
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,566
We're kind of like… Batman?

642
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:27,359
- Batman.
- Right, like Batman.

643
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:29,320
Invaluable to society.

644
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:33,199
And when someone dies on the job,

645
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:36,410
nine out of ten owners get fined
or a suspended sentence.

646
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:37,745
Isn't that ridiculous?

647
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:41,624
Statistically, only a mere 0.591%
end up serving time.

648
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:43,125
Whatever.

649
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:45,920
Looks like you've come fully prepared,

650
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:48,923
but I wonder if we even have

651
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:53,260
0.591% chance of succeeding.

652
00:41:58,182 --> 00:41:59,683
Hey, why did you write this?

653
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:01,393
The number's a bit…

654
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:03,562
BEAUTY JOO

655
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:07,399
Why aren't my views going up?

656
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:13,405
<i>I used to watch out of pity.</i>
<i>Are you not uploading anymore?</i>

657
00:42:15,991 --> 00:42:17,993
<i>I'll be coming back soon!</i>

658
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:26,585
God, you startled me.
Ever heard of manners?

659
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:27,670
I told you to knock!

660
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:31,298
Happy?

661
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:36,053
- What did you do today?
- What else would I do?

662
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:39,014
I went to work.

663
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:44,562
I know you've been hanging out
with Nothing Mu-jin.

664
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:48,941
It's not my business what you get up to,
but there are boundaries to respect.

665
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:50,859
Things between us aren't settled yet.

666
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:53,028
Excuse me, I don't appreciate that.

667
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:55,823
Please don't call my brother-in-law
Nothing Mu-jin.

668
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:57,324
He doesn't have nothing.

669
00:42:58,742 --> 00:42:59,702
It's on sale.

670
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,497
- Have a taste and bring your mom.
- Okay.

671
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:09,378
Where are your parents?

672
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:13,924
<i>He has no awareness,</i>
<i>no maturity, and no money.</i>

673
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:16,010
BUILD IT UP EVERY DAY
MAKE SURE TO CHECK IN

674
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:22,516
<i>And no luck either.</i>

675
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,061
Want me to go on?

676
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:27,771
That's enough. Stop.

677
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:29,273
Man, how pitiful.

678
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:33,527
You were so hard on him,
and that's why he became an inchworm.

679
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:34,528
An inchworm?

680
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:35,487
You know,

681
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:38,866
that bug that twitches and hesitates,
overthinking every step,

682
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:40,909
and ends up doing nothing in the end.

683
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:45,122
I tell him how to make money,
but he overthinks it so much.

684
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:47,124
He can't do a single thing.

685
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:49,627
He's an idiot.

686
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:51,879
What do you mean? Make money how?

687
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:53,213
Never mind.

688
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:56,717
Seriously, if he doesn't pay me,
I'm going to report him.

689
00:43:57,343 --> 00:44:00,346
You might be okay being around him
because he's a pushover,

690
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:04,808
but you won't get anything out of him,
so just get another job, please.

691
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:06,518
So much nagging. Just go!

692
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:10,064
How long are you gonna stay here?
Are you really not going back home?

693
00:44:10,856 --> 00:44:12,816
Not until he gets his act together.

694
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,443
Please go back home.

695
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:17,404
Hold on,

696
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:19,239
this isn't your home.

697
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:21,950
What's with the attitude?

698
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:26,121
I kept the deposit in and let you
live here alone out of pity, you little…

699
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,415
Want me to give notice?

700
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:31,669
That's not what I was saying.

701
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:34,963
I'm sorry, okay?

702
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:36,590
You're sorry?

703
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:38,050
Yeah, I'm sorry.

704
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:42,012
Fine. Then go out and get some beer.

705
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:44,848
Damn it.

706
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:53,690
<i>Only on the condition that</i>
<i>the law-abiding companies are left alone.</i>

707
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:02,282
LET'S GO VIRAL

708
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:06,578
#NATIONALPRIDE #GYEONJJANG
SUBSCRIBE AND LIKE

709
00:45:15,754 --> 00:45:19,049
Can't you turn that down
or off completely?

710
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:22,678
Big brother, you need to get fired up.

711
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:24,054
Confidence is key.

712
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:26,473
Yes, confidence. Got it?

713
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:28,058
Don't get intimidated.

714
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,561
Don't be nervous. Just stick to the plan.

715
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:33,522
When we get there,
flash them your business card,

716
00:45:33,605 --> 00:45:36,316
scan the entire factory floor like a hawk,

717
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,944
uncover all the illegal
and unlawful elements,

718
00:45:39,027 --> 00:45:40,487
then we'll step in and…

719
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,531
Like that would work.

720
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:46,201
If it doesn't work, make it work.
Impossible is nothing.

721
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:47,286
IMPOSSIBLE IS NOTHING

722
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:48,704
Impossible is nothing!

723
00:45:48,787 --> 00:45:50,372
Give me a break.

724
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:54,293
Anyway, if it doesn't feel right,
I'm walking away.

725
00:45:54,376 --> 00:45:55,461
We've arrived.

726
00:45:56,628 --> 00:45:58,755
- Right.
- I have a good feeling.

727
00:45:58,839 --> 00:45:59,673
Let's go!

728
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:10,184
This actually works.

729
00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:30,329
You need to wear earplugs.

730
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:31,330
Earplugs.

731
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:33,040
WEAR EARPLUGS

732
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:40,088
No safety helmets.

733
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:41,590
Fire hydrants look old.

734
00:46:41,673 --> 00:46:42,966
Inadequate ventilation.

735
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:44,468
INSPECTION CRITERIA

736
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:46,553
Here you go.

737
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:04,780
Poor fire extinguisher maintenance.

738
00:47:07,282 --> 00:47:09,368
Improper storage of hazardous materials.

739
00:47:10,118 --> 00:47:12,412
Hey, be careful!

740
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:14,790
- Above you…
- Up!

741
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:19,169
Hey, stop…

742
00:47:20,837 --> 00:47:22,548
A small token of my appreciation.

743
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:31,306
Failure to wear dust masks.

744
00:47:32,432 --> 00:47:34,601
Dust concentration is at 30 mg!

745
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:43,527
Careful. Watch it.

746
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:51,326
Yes. This way, please.

747
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:53,704
Gyeon-u, move that a little to the right.

748
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:55,998
A little more to the right. That's it.

749
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:58,584
- Where do you want the sofa?
- Yes, this way, please.

750
00:47:58,667 --> 00:48:00,294
Okay, please put it right here.

751
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:01,920
Is that right?

752
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:04,464
- The landlord! Hello, it's been a while.
- Yes…

753
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:05,882
Miss Manager.

754
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:07,884
What is all this?

755
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:12,055
Oh, our furniture looked a little worn.
We thought we'd freshen things up.

756
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:14,766
Seems like you've got some business going.

757
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:18,895
If you have money for all of this,
tell your boss to pay the back rent.

758
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:21,273
- Oh, have you not checked it yet?
- Checked what?

759
00:48:21,356 --> 00:48:23,650
We paid all the overdue rent yesterday.

760
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:25,277
Really?

761
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:27,863
Please check it.

762
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:30,824
We look forward to your continued support.

763
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:38,915
My, you're a handsome fellow
now that I look at you.

764
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:44,671
Right, thank you.

765
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:47,591
Aren't we overdoing it a bit?

766
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,636
We've been signing
more clients on retainer,

767
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:53,597
so this is hardly overdoing it, boss.

768
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,015
Exactly.

769
00:48:55,682 --> 00:48:57,392
Wait, are you scared?

770
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:01,897
No, I'm not scared. Just being careful.

771
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:06,526
Plenty of people see a little success,
get cocky, and then crash and burn.

772
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:08,904
There you go again being an inchworm.

773
00:49:08,987 --> 00:49:10,364
What worm?

774
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:11,907
Actually, Mu-jin,

775
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:16,370
since we're on the subject,
why don't we take things up a notch?

776
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:17,954
What do you mean?

777
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:20,707
Are we going to keep
to small businesses forever?

778
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:23,502
Even just outside the city,
there are quite a few…

779
00:49:24,419 --> 00:49:26,546
- Are you listening?
- Yeah.

780
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:27,923
Even just outside the city,

781
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:31,551
there are quite a few large factories
that aren't run properly.

782
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:32,469
Yes, true.

783
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:35,305
While we're on a roll,
we need to push hard,

784
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:37,099
bring in a partner labor attorney,

785
00:49:37,182 --> 00:49:41,395
move to a bigger office,
and build a proper labor law firm.

786
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:42,729
It's good enough already…

787
00:49:44,439 --> 00:49:47,776
And then, maybe Mi-joo will finally
stop nagging so much.

788
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:51,822
Does she know what we're doing?

789
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:54,032
I haven't told her any details,

790
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:55,909
but I've been hinting to her

791
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:59,121
that things have been going well.

792
00:49:59,204 --> 00:50:01,289
She seemed quite hopeful.

793
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:04,376
And I think maybe she's waiting for you.

794
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:09,131
Jackpot! Big brother, look at this.

795
00:50:09,214 --> 00:50:10,465
This factory is crazy.

796
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:11,967
What? Did you find something?

797
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:15,470
TAEHYEOP STEEL
4 DEATHS IN 5 YEARS

798
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:17,764
3RD HIGHEST UNREPORTED ACCIDENTS
IN GYEONGGI-DO

799
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:19,516
SLAP ON THE WRIST
REPEATED ACCIDENTS

800
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:22,144
What're you doing? Get the car ready.

801
00:50:22,227 --> 00:50:23,645
Oh, yeah!

802
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:27,149
I'll turn on the AC,
so please come down in five.

803
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:32,821
I taught him well.

804
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:38,660
Something really stinks about this place.

805
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:40,495
A lot of accidents happen here,

806
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:43,665
but there's no record
of the owner ever being punished.

807
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:46,293
That means
they managed to get away with it.

808
00:50:47,085 --> 00:50:50,380
Is it because of their size?
That's a super expensive car.

809
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:51,631
I know.

810
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:52,549
Wait.

811
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:54,885
Let's renegotiate our split.

812
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:56,470
I want a 60-40 split. I get 60.

813
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:58,221
Are you kidding me?

814
00:50:58,305 --> 00:51:00,557
We plan it out, drive you,
and close the deals.

815
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,518
If we're 40,
that means we only get 20% each.

816
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:05,687
It makes no sense
you get 60 and we get 20.

817
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:07,564
You can't do this without me anyway.

818
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:11,568
Wow, you're seriously mistaken.
They turn out 500 labor attorneys a year.

819
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:16,239
And how many of them would want to do
such pathetic and worthless work?

820
00:51:21,077 --> 00:51:23,747
Fine, 50-50. Not a percent higher.

821
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:29,294
You've got a deal.

822
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:31,713
Fine.

823
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:35,217
I was fine with 20 too.

824
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:37,302
Okay, let's do this, brother-in-law.

825
00:51:37,385 --> 00:51:38,303
Yes, big brother!

826
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:42,599
What? What is it?

827
00:51:42,682 --> 00:51:45,769
I suddenly have
a personal matter to attend to.

828
00:51:45,852 --> 00:51:47,270
A personal matter? Like what?

829
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:50,357
What is it?

830
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:04,120
How can I help you?

831
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:06,665
Hi there. Is the owner inside?

832
00:52:06,748 --> 00:52:07,999
What is this about?

833
00:52:09,042 --> 00:52:12,462
We're here for a special
on-site safety inspection and review.

834
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:13,588
Right…

835
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:17,884
Are you from the Safety and Health Agency?

836
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:20,554
Yes, in the grand scheme of things,
that's correct.

837
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:22,347
What's this camera for?

838
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:26,101
It's for record-keeping purposes.
It's necessary for our internal data.

839
00:52:26,184 --> 00:52:27,561
I hope you can understand.

840
00:52:31,022 --> 00:52:32,691
Well, okay. Please come this way.

841
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:35,652
Come in.

842
00:52:36,444 --> 00:52:39,155
If you'd let us know you were coming,

843
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:42,784
I would've told my father…
I mean, the CEO.

844
00:52:42,868 --> 00:52:44,953
He's out visiting a client right now.

845
00:52:45,036 --> 00:52:47,330
- You're the owner's son?
- Yes.

846
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:49,124
And your title is?

847
00:52:49,207 --> 00:52:52,085
Well, for now, I'm down as the director.

848
00:52:52,168 --> 00:52:54,379
- The director, for now?
- Yes.

849
00:52:55,046 --> 00:52:58,258
- Here, take a seat.
- Right, okay.

850
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:00,677
You need to survey the floor.

851
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,429
- Right.
- I'll show you around.

852
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:03,346
It's fine.

853
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:07,350
Yes, you have things to discuss with me.

854
00:53:09,477 --> 00:53:10,395
Right…

855
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:13,523
- Machine's down!
- Excuse me.

856
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:15,108
- Where's the supervisor?
- Again?

857
00:53:15,191 --> 00:53:16,818
Why is this one always breaking?

858
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:17,944
- Over there.
- Nimal!

859
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:19,696
Maybe you're the broken one.

860
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:21,531
Pick up the pace!

861
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:30,582
Wait.

862
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:33,126
Halt!

863
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:41,176
You good?

864
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:44,304
Hey, Nimal! Get your act together!

865
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:46,890
This is exactly why
the machine keeps malfunctioning!

866
00:53:50,226 --> 00:53:51,227
And you are?

867
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:53,521
Right, so…

868
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:58,276
If we don't pay up,
you'll pick our factory apart?

869
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:01,279
Rather than getting reported
and paying the fines,

870
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:05,241
wouldn't it be better for both of us
to settle for a smaller amount?

871
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:07,327
Are you blackmailing us?

872
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:08,328
Oh, no!

873
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:09,621
Blackmailing?

874
00:54:09,704 --> 00:54:14,042
We're only here to share some tips
about preventing workplace accidents.

875
00:54:14,709 --> 00:54:16,044
We looked into it,

876
00:54:16,127 --> 00:54:20,256
and it seems Taehyeop Steel does have
more accidents than other factories.

877
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:21,257
Right.

878
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:24,761
Man.

879
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:26,429
Hey.

880
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:28,723
What are you?

881
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:31,810
You're scammers, aren't you?

882
00:54:31,893 --> 00:54:34,104
Get that camera out of my face.

883
00:54:34,187 --> 00:54:37,899
Don't you know that a camera can be
deadlier than a gun in this country?

884
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:42,237
Man, these scammers, seriously.

885
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,154
Hey.

886
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:46,533
Shall I press this?

887
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:50,036
Why? To turn yourself in?

888
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,287
Suits us just fine.

889
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:52,998
Yes, press it. Go on.

890
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:57,168
And, hey, let's get one thing straight.

891
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:59,295
Scammers make up things that don't exist,

892
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:01,923
but we're proposing a negotiation
based on facts.

893
00:55:02,757 --> 00:55:06,219
I'm here to help you
before things get out of hand.

894
00:55:06,302 --> 00:55:07,721
Think about it.

895
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:10,265
If he'd been hurt,
that would've been awful.

896
00:55:10,348 --> 00:55:12,684
You met me before that happened,

897
00:55:12,767 --> 00:55:16,104
so you guys really are fortunate.

898
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:33,246
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

899
00:55:33,329 --> 00:55:37,542
<i>Happy birthday, dear Mu-jin</i>

900
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:41,463
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

901
00:55:47,802 --> 00:55:48,636
Good job.

902
00:55:49,345 --> 00:55:51,222
What did you wish for?

903
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:52,891
For our family to be happy.

904
00:55:53,808 --> 00:55:55,351
What is this?

905
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:07,822
I'll be humiliated if I wear these.

906
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:10,658
They're all the same, aren't they?

907
00:56:10,742 --> 00:56:11,868
They'll make fun of me.

908
00:56:11,951 --> 00:56:13,828
No, they won't.

909
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:15,914
No one's going to be
looking at your shoes.

910
00:56:15,997 --> 00:56:17,665
Whatever. I'm going.

911
00:56:18,374 --> 00:56:20,460
Hey, Mu-jin!

912
00:56:21,586 --> 00:56:22,629
Hey!

913
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:27,467
Honestly, that kid…

914
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:29,761
What a temper.

915
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:39,979
Is this my life flashing before my eyes?

916
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:45,985
Can't you just take English lessons?

917
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:49,906
Everyone else is going abroad
on exchange programs and whatnot.

918
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:52,158
How will I compete?

919
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:57,247
We don't have that kind of money.

920
00:56:57,330 --> 00:57:01,459
If you get a loan to send me abroad,
I'll get a good job and pay you back.

921
00:57:02,293 --> 00:57:04,671
If we get a loan,
who will pay the interest?

922
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:07,757
- Shall I sell my kidney?
- Fine, whatever.

923
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:09,425
If I don't get into a big firm,

924
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:12,178
I'll do manual labor like my brother
and end up like Dad.

925
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:14,347
How can you say that?

926
00:57:19,727 --> 00:57:21,396
This flashback is too long.

927
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:26,818
I'm here.

928
00:57:26,901 --> 00:57:29,279
My, you must be tired from the trip.

929
00:57:29,362 --> 00:57:30,530
Not at all.

930
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:33,616
Where's Mu-jin? Didn't he come with you?

931
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:36,119
He can't come anymore.

932
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:39,914
He can't come? What do you mean?

933
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:40,915
He'll be…

934
00:57:41,749 --> 00:57:42,750
dying soon.

935
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:44,711
What?

936
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:48,756
- Is that so?
- That's all you have to say?

937
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,675
It's pathetic, isn't it?

938
00:57:50,758 --> 00:57:53,094
Drifting through life
and then dying like this.

939
00:57:54,053 --> 00:57:57,265
He was like that from a young age.

940
00:57:58,099 --> 00:58:00,268
He only thought about himself,

941
00:58:00,351 --> 00:58:04,564
but it's not like he was anything special.

942
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:05,482
That's true.

943
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:13,031
Seriously, what in the world
are you talking about?

944
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:15,408
I'm not dead yet!

945
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:18,495
That's right. Not yet.

946
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:19,871
But you will be soon.

947
00:58:20,371 --> 00:58:21,372
No, I won't.

948
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:23,333
- Do you want to live?
- Of course, Mom!

949
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:27,045
What's the point? You won't change.
You'll keep being selfish.

950
00:58:27,128 --> 00:58:28,588
How would you know?

951
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:30,882
Do you know how selfish he is?

952
00:58:43,978 --> 00:58:44,938
Open the door!

953
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:48,900
Please help me!

954
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:02,747
Please open the door!

955
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:05,250
Please help me!

956
00:59:31,776 --> 00:59:35,405
Didn't you hear what I said?
Why didn't you open the door?

957
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:38,449
Why did you just stand there?

958
00:59:39,617 --> 00:59:40,618
You're…

959
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:51,504
Wait,

960
00:59:52,964 --> 00:59:55,174
why are you talking down at me?

961
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:58,094
I'm old enough to do so.

962
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:01,848
You wanted to live, so I came to help.

963
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:04,517
But you don't seem too desperate.

964
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:05,435
You'll…

965
01:00:06,352 --> 01:00:07,270
help me live?

966
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:09,689
How?

967
01:00:10,565 --> 01:00:11,983
In today's world,

968
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:17,155
countless souls
who worked diligently but died unfairly

969
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:21,492
are roaming the Earth even after death.

970
01:00:24,078 --> 01:00:27,999
But I'm too busy
to look after all of them.

971
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:31,628
So will you take my place

972
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:35,048
and help those souls
find peace and move on?

973
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:37,967
Me? How would I…

974
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:39,218
You're a labor attorney.

975
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:43,264
"A noble profession
serving those who toil."

976
01:00:45,099 --> 01:00:47,518
"An advocate
who stands up for working people."

977
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:58,321
Labor attorney No Mu-jin.

978
01:00:59,614 --> 01:01:00,615
That's you, isn't it?

979
01:01:05,244 --> 01:01:07,121
Where did you get this?

980
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:11,459
Yeah, that's me, but…

981
01:01:12,418 --> 01:01:13,670
Well then…

982
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:22,011
Here, sign this.

983
01:01:24,222 --> 01:01:25,056
What is it?

984
01:01:25,139 --> 01:01:26,557
What else could it be?

985
01:01:27,308 --> 01:01:30,144
- It's an employment contract.
- An employment contract?

986
01:01:30,228 --> 01:01:33,439
Times have really changed.
Such things exist now.

987
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:35,400
Back in my day,

988
01:01:35,483 --> 01:01:38,653
if they fed you, you said "thank you" and…

989
01:01:38,736 --> 01:01:40,363
If I sign here…

990
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:44,575
will you really let me live?

991
01:01:44,659 --> 01:01:45,660
Of course.

992
01:01:46,786 --> 01:01:48,830
I always keep my promises.

993
01:01:53,418 --> 01:01:54,961
How can I trust you?

994
01:01:55,044 --> 01:01:56,879
Then just die.

995
01:01:57,797 --> 01:02:00,174
Then again, what's the point?

996
01:02:00,758 --> 01:02:02,385
You won't change.

997
01:02:02,468 --> 01:02:04,387
You'll keep being selfish.

998
01:02:05,179 --> 01:02:07,348
Okay, fine. I'll do--

999
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:23,740
Hurry up and sign.

1000
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:25,700
What's the holdup?

1001
01:02:25,783 --> 01:02:27,994
You're about to die
and you're being picky?

1002
01:02:30,121 --> 01:02:31,622
Decide already!

1003
01:02:31,706 --> 01:02:32,540
Life's a one--

1004
01:02:32,623 --> 01:02:34,125
A one-shot game, I know!

1005
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:37,378
I'm about to die,
so I need to check the fine print!

1006
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:39,464
I'm not dying just once here.

1007
01:02:40,006 --> 01:02:41,340
It's twice!

1008
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:44,302
Then just die here right now.

1009
01:02:44,385 --> 01:02:46,763
Okay, fine. I'll sign it.

1010
01:03:00,735 --> 01:03:02,737
Wait, I haven't finished reading it…

1011
01:03:05,239 --> 01:03:08,117
Okay, well, the contract's in place now.

1012
01:03:08,201 --> 01:03:12,038
I look forward to your work,
labor attorney No Mu-jin.

1013
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:13,873
Wait, I haven't finished reading!

1014
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:16,584
I didn't finish! Hey, you!

1015
01:03:36,854 --> 01:03:38,481
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

1016
01:03:44,111 --> 01:03:46,447
- What, do you know him?
- Let's go.

1017
01:03:47,031 --> 01:03:48,324
Do you know him?

1018
01:03:48,407 --> 01:03:49,367
Gosh, you're tiring.

1019
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:51,828
I'm sorry.

1020
01:04:34,662 --> 01:04:35,955
<i>Who are you?</i>

1021
01:04:36,038 --> 01:04:36,914
What's wrong?

1022
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:38,624
Am I the only one seeing this?

1023
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:41,544
<i>- So it's true that you can see ghosts?</i>
- Hey, no!

1024
01:04:41,627 --> 01:04:46,549
- What grudge made you seek me out?
- Min-uk!

1025
01:04:46,632 --> 01:04:47,633
You piece of shit!

1026
01:04:49,135 --> 01:04:50,720
Big brother!

1027
01:04:50,803 --> 01:04:52,096
- Big…
- That hurts!

1028
01:04:52,179 --> 01:04:53,222
You got possessed.

1029
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:54,140
Possessed?

1030
01:04:54,223 --> 01:04:56,893
A ghost-seeing labor attorney
helps ghosts find peace.

1031
01:04:57,435 --> 01:04:59,562
Work undercover? Me? Why?

1032
01:04:59,645 --> 01:05:03,107
<i>Get him! Anyone who catches him</i>
<i>will get a 100,000-won bonus!</i>

1033
01:05:04,984 --> 01:05:06,235
<i>Do you even have proof?</i>

1034
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:07,945
<i>These bastards are totally busted.</i>

1035
01:05:10,823 --> 01:05:12,825
