00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,457
Boss! Mu-jin!

2
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:50,467
Are you okay?

3
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,013
Hui-joo…

5
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:23,625
Seriously, I almost had him.

6
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,627
Why'd you have to mess up?

7
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,129
I laid everything out,
only for you to ruin it.

8
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:29,714
You ruined everything, Mu-jin.

9
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:34,886
You almost lost your only brother-in-law.
How could you say that?

10
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:38,807
But it's a relief
you weren't hurt, big brother.

11
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:44,562
Don't move an inch until we arrive.
You reek.

12
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:47,524
It's dry now!

13
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:50,527
I actually think
this could be an opportunity.

14
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:52,362
What?

15
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:56,157
How about we use that accident
to pressure the owner?

16
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:58,910
You're really on the ball today.

17
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,497
What do you think, Mu-jin?

18
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:08,336
Hey, listen.

19
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:11,631
Something really weird
happened to me earlier.

20
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:13,550
I know, me too.

21
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:17,178
I've never seen
a fully grown adult wet themselves.

22
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,139
You're dead if you tell Mi-joo.

23
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,143
No, that's beside the point.

24
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:26,896
When that stuff rained down on me earlier,
there were…

25
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,858
all these flames engulfing…

26
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:33,111
Flames engulfing what?

27
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:41,995
- That startled me.
- Who are you?

28
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,499
Who are you?

29
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,836
What's wrong? What are you looking at?

30
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,296
- Huh?
- Hey…

31
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,675
What's wrong with you, Mu-jin?

32
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:57,844
- This…
- Please stop doing that.

33
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:01,681
When I get overly stressed,
I start having some personal issues…

34
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:04,559
Hey, can't you see this?

35
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:06,060
Am I the only one?

36
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:09,981
See what, Mu-jin? Seriously!

37
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:26,706
- Gyeon-u.
- Yes?

38
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,542
Take me to a hospital.

39
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,377
Hey, take him to a hospital.

40
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,060
- Big brother.
- Mu-jin.

41
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:49,062
What did they say? Are you okay?

42
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,565
Well, there's no external trauma…

43
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,359
But you have internal injuries?

44
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,277
No, it's not that.

45
00:03:58,112 --> 00:04:01,616
She thinks my energy's blocked
and suggested a Korean medicine clinic.

46
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:03,952
- A Korean medicine clinic?
- Yes.

47
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:06,371
Her husband's the doctor there.

48
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:11,167
- He's totally getting milked.
- Korean medicine's good.

49
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:17,966
Mr. No Mu-jin?

50
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,885
I'm going to apply the moxa now.

51
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:22,804
Please lie on your back.

52
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,144
You startled me.

53
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:32,522
You must scare easily.

54
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:35,024
Don't worry. This isn't that hot.

55
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,944
- No, it's not that…
- Please lie down.

56
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:43,783
Will that help me stop seeing things?

57
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,118
Of course.

58
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:48,621
You're seeing things
because your energy is weak.

59
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,540
It's all right. Please lie down.

60
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,626
I'm applying it now.

61
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,503
- That's hot.
- It's okay, right?

62
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,216
Please rest.

63
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:12,854
Who's been ordering two drinks at a time?
I'm on to you.

64
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:15,815
Mu-jin!

65
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:19,360
Is your energy unblocked now?

66
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,780
No, it's blocked again.

67
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,699
What? Blocked again?

68
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:27,869
Were you here alone? Where's Gyeon-u?

69
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:29,787
Where you'd expect.

70
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,875
I was attending to a personal matter.

71
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,003
That matter again?

72
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:39,380
It must be nice
being so bright and optimistic.

73
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:42,759
Thank you.
It must be the effect of your radiance.

74
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,053
Were you born with that,
or do you get lessons?

75
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:47,430
You've got a real gift for kissing up.

76
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:50,308
- Can you answer my question?
- Thank you.

77
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:51,684
Can you see ghosts or not?

78
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,187
I can.

79
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,564
You can? Did you hear that?

80
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:59,233
It must be here.
It's here, isn't it? Where is it?

81
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:02,278
Well, next to you.

82
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,823
Next to me? He said it's next to me.

83
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:08,451
Where? Next to me where?

84
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,119
Here?

85
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,120
Here…

86
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:13,164
Hey, no!

87
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,415
Big brother!

88
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,793
- This could be an opportunity!
- What opportunity?

89
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:20,338
"The world's first ghost-seeing
labor attorney helps ghosts find peace."

90
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:22,131
I help them while you make money?

91
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,050
Come on. This will work.

92
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:26,803
We'll get to a million,
even ten million, in no time.

93
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,721
I can feel it. This will blow up.

94
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,348
Good for you.

95
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:34,268
Wait, Mu-jin, so it's true
that you can see ghosts?

96
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:36,020
Then at least ask them.

97
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:38,397
Ask them what grudge
made them show up like this.

98
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,738
You don't believe me, do you?

99
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:48,991
No, I totally believe you.
Right? We talked about that.

100
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,159
Right. We trust you.

101
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:55,540
Like how you said
that person on fire helped you.

102
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:58,209
- And how you need to help souls…
- Find peace.

103
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:00,545
How you need to help souls find peace.

104
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,922
We believe you, really.
You need to help them.

105
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:06,300
You're not trying to get views
by uploading "My Ghost-Seeing Boss"?

106
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:09,428
That's quite catchy.
"My Ghost-Seeing Boss."

107
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:10,763
Are you writing that down?

108
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,889
MY GHOST-SEEING BOSS

109
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:15,726
Just ask them, please. I'm really curious.

110
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:18,020
Ask them.

111
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:36,956
What grudge made you seek me out?

112
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,002
Hey.

113
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:43,504
I didn't think he'd actually ask.

114
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,131
There's nothing there.

115
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,841
Look at his face.

116
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:48,384
Are you kidding me?

117
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,970
I didn't think he'd ask so seriously.

118
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:52,555
My name is…

119
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:55,808
Lee Min-uk.

120
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,440
Sweetie, did you pack medicine?

121
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:04,442
I'm sure they have basic meds there too.

122
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:07,069
And Mom, I need to go right now.

123
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,488
Already?

124
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,865
The <i>galbi-jjim</i> is almost done.
Your favorite.

125
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:14,827
My teacher's coming to the terminal
to see me off, so I need to go.

126
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:15,745
Oh, but…

127
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:20,124
I marinated the beef last night
so you could eat it before you go.

128
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:23,336
I should've started earlier
if I'd known you'd leave early.

129
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:24,837
It's fine.

130
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:28,174
I'm going to be on the bus for a while,
so I might get sick.

131
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:31,469
It's just a work placement.
It'd be nice if you could commute.

132
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:32,887
It's too far for that.

133
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,723
Plus, it's easier
if I don't have to commute.

134
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:37,016
Still…

135
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:40,102
That's how I feel as your mother.

136
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,065
- I really have to go.
- Okay.

137
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:46,400
Call me if you're having a hard time.

138
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:48,152
I'm not a kid.

139
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:50,530
Yes, you are. You're not an adult yet.

140
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:53,699
My baby.

141
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:57,119
Show me that thing before you go.

142
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,831
- I really have to go.
- Come on.

143
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,085
Seon-hui, you've got this!

144
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,840
- I'm going.
- Okay.

145
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,052
Be careful out there.

146
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:15,471
Bye.

147
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,975
Your teacher was full of praise for you.

148
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,894
He said you're hardworking
and sensible for your age.

149
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,855
These days,
kids your age avoid jobs like this,

150
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,774
saying it's back-breaking grunt work.

151
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:29,277
They all have their noses in the air.

152
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,531
That is the problem with our country.

153
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:35,408
At this rate, we're all screwed.

154
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:36,367
Hello, Director.

155
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,451
- Yeah.
- This way, sir.

156
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,744
Yeah, come this way.

157
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:43,040
Keep your nose clean and do the work well,

158
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,959
and I'll hire you right away.

159
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,377
So work hard, got it?

160
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:50,298
This is where you'll be staying.

161
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:51,507
The dormitory.

162
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,310
EMPLOYEE DORMITORY

163
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,770
I told those punks to take this down.

164
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:06,647
It's nice, right?

165
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,151
I heard I'd be getting
separate housing off-site.

166
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:11,652
What?

167
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:15,865
I guess there was a miscommunication.

168
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,491
No, this is the place.

169
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:18,826
It's great here.

170
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:21,454
Anything happens at the factory,
you can go at once,

171
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:23,956
and there's no commute cost,
no expenses at all.

172
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,041
Hey!

173
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,501
Hey!

174
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,048
Isn't that right?

175
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,300
What?

176
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,801
"What?"

177
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,971
Oh, and by the way…

178
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,726
if you're being so picky already,

179
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,645
I'd be too afraid

180
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:47,980
to hire you permanently.

181
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:51,901
I'll work hard.

182
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,444
All right. Okay?

183
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:57,073
Right then.
Unpack your things and get to work.

184
00:10:57,156 --> 00:11:01,160
All you need to do is enter the numbers
on this purchase order.

185
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:06,415
When you press the start button
and the foot pedal together, it starts.

186
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:11,337
Sometimes, the machine acts up midway.

187
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,254
Come look.

188
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:16,592
- See that belt?
- Yes.

189
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:18,719
It gets stuck because of grease buildup.

190
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:21,097
If you go in and clean it,
it'll start up again.

191
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,308
- Isn't it dangerous?
- It is.

192
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,560
If you're not careful,
you'll get sucked in.

193
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:29,146
It'll be fine if the machine's off, right?

194
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,231
Jesus Christ.

195
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:33,192
If you turn off the machine,
you'll hold up the entire line.

196
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:35,820
That'll cause a drop in output,
so you can't do that.

197
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:38,739
Just be sensible and use your head.

198
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,618
And here's the maintenance manual.

199
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:46,038
If it breaks, just look it up and fix it.

200
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:48,040
- I have to fix it?
- Yeah.

201
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:49,834
Today's my last day.

202
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,796
Cheer up.

203
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,511
Oh, but don't call me.

204
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,109
Min-uk.

205
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,446
Aren't you sleeping?

206
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:22,450
Go ahead and sleep.
I need to read a bit more.

207
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,120
Hey.

208
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:29,165
- You're so feeble at your age!
<i>- How's work? Is it going okay?</i>

209
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:32,168
<i>Yeah, it's fine.</i>
<i>It's nothing too difficult.</i>

210
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:36,297
<i>How are your colleagues?</i>
<i>Are they showing you the ropes?</i>

211
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,841
<i>They're not bossing you around?</i>

212
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:41,594
<i>No, they're all nice to me.</i>

213
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:44,305
<i>Still, always be careful.</i>

214
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:47,808
<i>I heard accidents happen</i>
<i>in the blink of an eye at factories.</i>

215
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:49,518
Move your foot, kid!

216
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:53,481
<i>Don't worry.</i>
<i>It's exactly what I learned at school.</i>

217
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:57,776
<i>I don't have to commute, so I have time</i>
<i>to work out at the company gym.</i>

218
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,237
<i>The food's good too.</i>

219
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,948
<i>I've been eating three square meals a day.</i>

220
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,160
How are you?

221
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:09,079
I've already eaten.

222
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:14,084
I'm in the dormitory now.

223
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:22,343
<i>I go to bed early</i>
<i>and stick to a regular routine.</i>

224
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,763
<i>So don't worry about me, Mom.</i>

225
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,725
Slowly, keep it centered.

226
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:32,770
<i>We've had more orders come in,</i>
<i>so we're busy this holiday,</i>

227
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:35,981
<i>but the boss said we'll get a bonus</i>
<i>if we get everything done.</i>

228
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:40,986
<i>Even if you're busy,</i>
<i>you're working through Chuseok?</i>

229
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,322
<i>I'll be able to go home on the day of.</i>

230
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,449
<i>I'll get some beef ribs for us.</i>

231
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,834
One, two, three!

232
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,671
Big brother!

233
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,548
Big brother!

234
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:02,383
Big brother!

235
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:04,218
Big…

236
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,723
That hurts! Stop.

237
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,895
Are you back with us now?

238
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:21,944
What happened?

239
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:23,612
<i>What?</i>

240
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:26,615
<i>What's he doing, Gyeon-u? He's not moving.</i>

241
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:28,701
<i>Did he just crash?</i>

242
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:30,911
<i>- Hit him.</i>
<i>- What?</i>

243
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:33,205
<i>I can't hit my brother-in-law.</i>

244
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:35,124
<i>I can't do it.</i>

245
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:38,085
What's the harm? Just hit him once.

246
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:39,962
Geez.

247
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,715
Mu-jin, stop messing around.

248
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:44,925
Hey!

249
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,678
<i>Hey, dummy!</i>

250
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:50,014
<i>What's wrong with him?</i>

251
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:52,683
<i>Boss?</i>

252
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:54,518
<i>God, move aside.</i>

253
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:57,062
<i>- Seriously, what's he doing?</i>
<i>- Like this.</i>

254
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:59,064
<i>Big brother?</i>

255
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:00,858
<i>Big brother?</i>

256
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:02,526
<i>Big brother!</i>

257
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:05,738
- Big brother!
- Hey!

258
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:07,072
Big brother!

259
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,366
Big brother!

260
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,411
<i>- Big…</i>
<i>- That hurts!</i>

261
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:18,626
"Big brother"?

262
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,670
Is that how you treat your big brother?

263
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,924
I was just worried about you…

264
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:25,841
And you.

265
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,469
"Hey, dummy" is a bit much, isn't it?

266
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:35,100
That was you getting possessed.

267
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,018
Possessed?

268
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,729
Like when a ghost enters your body.

269
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:43,025
Even if I've been possessed,
you can't just slap someone so…

270
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:46,737
I've heard stories about this,
but I got goosebumps seeing it in person.

271
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,989
I got so many. Wanna see?

272
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,240
How hard did you slap me

273
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:52,826
that I can't even feel my jaw?

274
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,161
You did go overboard.

275
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:58,707
Is this really the factory we visited?

276
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,794
It is. I saw it.
Min-uk followed us from there too.

277
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:04,713
I'm not surprised.
That place seemed sketchy.

278
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,256
You said you looked into them

279
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,134
but missed this crucial detail
and tried to blackmail them?

280
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:11,053
It's not blackmail.

281
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,389
And how would we know every little detail?

282
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,683
That's why you look into them, isn't it?

283
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:18,394
Now, now. What's the use in us fighting?

284
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:21,939
Let's calm down.
We can ask everything we want to know.

285
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:24,858
- That's why we came here, isn't it?
- Exactly.

286
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:28,153
They can't do the research right,
but they sure can hit people.

287
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:29,238
Are you still upset?

288
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:33,117
We weren't hitting you.
We just touched you so you'd wake up.

289
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,201
This is hitting.

290
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:36,245
- She's right.
- No, touching.

291
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,955
- Touching.
- This is hitting.

292
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:41,291
If that was touching,
what's your definition of hitting?

293
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:44,294
- You're upset.
- The pain should be gone by now.

294
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:46,964
So he's got more than just his appearance.

295
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:50,300
He has good connections,
even a reporter friend.

296
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:53,470
He studied media in college
and worked as a reporter for a while.

297
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:54,847
But he quit pretty quickly.

298
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:58,017
Then why is he making
trashy nationalist content now?

299
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,101
How would I know?

300
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,145
He's your boyfriend.

301
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:04,481
He's not. He has a crush on me,
so he's making a fool of himself.

302
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:08,152
But you keep encouraging him,
and I'm the one who has to deal with it.

303
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:10,112
- Of course.
- I appreciate it.

304
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:13,657
Say hello.

305
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:17,327
This is the legendary leader in labor law,
labor attorney Mr. No Mu-jin.

306
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,872
- And this is…
- I'm Gyeon-u's girlfriend, Na Hui-joo.

307
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,208
Right…

308
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:27,546
Yes, I'm No Mu-jin.

309
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:32,259
I'm Lee Yeo-jin.
I used to work with Gyeon-u.

310
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:34,344
- Nice to meet you.
- I'm in social affairs.

311
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:37,806
- Social affairs reporter…
- Social affairs reporter, Lee Yeo-jin.

312
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:40,642
Right.

313
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,314
This way.

314
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:46,231
Sure.

315
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:57,910
I did look into it,

316
00:17:57,993 --> 00:18:00,788
but the desk shut it down,
so I didn't get far.

317
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:03,457
Just tell us anything
that might be useful.

318
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,585
Contact info for someone
at the kid's school. Things like that.

319
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:08,420
Telling you isn't the problem.

320
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:11,048
The school won't cooperate
because of their image.

321
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:14,760
Once that "accident" label sticks,
they'll find it hard to recruit students.

322
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:17,096
With work placements,
you work for a few months,

323
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,681
and if you're liked,
you get hired permanently.

324
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:24,103
It boosts their employment rate,
so they're keen to send students out.

325
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,897
But Lee Min-uk's accident was pretty bad,

326
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,691
so I got the sense
they just wanted to bury it.

327
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:33,070
Anything to call the company out on?

328
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:37,366
Well, you could call them out
on safety equipment or poor management,

329
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:40,994
but it didn't happen during work hours,
so it's tricky.

330
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:44,289
Why would he work the machine
outside of his work hours?

331
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,999
That doesn't make any sense.

332
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,085
- He was clearly told to.
- What's wrong?

333
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:49,753
- Stop.
- Well…

334
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:52,714
The owner said he never gave that order.

335
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,260
And you believe that? As a reporter?

336
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:57,511
Stop it, Hui-joo.

337
00:18:57,594 --> 00:19:00,806
The bereaved settled the matter
with the company,

338
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,642
so I can't exactly
report allegations, can I?

339
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:05,602
As a reporter.

340
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:08,689
Wait, settled?
They settled with the company?

341
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:10,023
Yes.

342
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:14,444
Anyway, that's all I can tell you.

343
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:18,615
I'll find the details for Min-uk's teacher
and his mother, and send them to you.

344
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:21,326
Thanks, really.
I'll treat you to a meal sometime.

345
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:25,289
I'm glad to see you're doing well.

346
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:29,751
- You just left suddenly, so we were all…
- Yes, well. Thanks.

347
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,212
If that's all you can tell us,
we'll be going now.

348
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,506
I'm glad you're doing well too.

349
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,674
Aren't you coming?

350
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:36,884
- Yes, coming.
- Yeah.

351
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,093
I'll call you later.

352
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:41,263
What's it to him how she's doing?
I don't get it.

353
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,557
- What's wrong? Are you mad?
- No.

354
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,684
You seem mad. What's wrong? What happened?

355
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:47,102
I said I'm not mad.

356
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,730
But you were grinning nonstop.

357
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:51,773
- You smile too easily.
- I do?

358
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,193
You really are clueless.

359
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:57,613
Me? Not you? That's news to me.

360
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:58,530
Hui-joo!

361
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:03,118
You said you were my girlfriend earlier.
Then it's day 1 for us today?

362
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:05,287
Move aside.

363
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:11,710
- Hang in there, brother-in-law.
- "Brother-in-law"?

364
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:13,003
Why not outlaw?

365
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,005
What's wrong with them?

366
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:17,507
In-law, outlaw.

367
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:19,843
In-law, outlaw…

368
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:22,012
EMPLOYMENT RATE

369
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:28,769
Is this a school or an employment agency?

370
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:31,480
Lee Min-uk…

371
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:35,692
I remember him.

372
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:41,073
In 2020, or 2021, he had an accident
while on a work placement.

373
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:43,033
Excuse me, sir.

374
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,744
It was 2020.

375
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:49,164
One of your students died,
and it doesn't ring a bell right away?

376
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:53,126
From what I hear, the work
he was assigned was quite dangerous.

377
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,796
Was it a task he was supposed to be doing?

378
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:57,673
Well, not really.

379
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:02,719
But when it comes to physical labor,
there are always risks involved.

380
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:06,556
Construction workers face fall hazards,

381
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,102
and production workers
can get caught in machines or suffer cuts.

382
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:14,606
Even athletes are at risk of injury,
aren't they?

383
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:15,649
What?

384
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:21,697
This factory lacked proper safety measures
and didn't follow safety regulations.

385
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:26,243
It's not normal to send a young student
to train at a place like that, is it?

386
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:31,790
I mean, you can't expect a teacher
to visit every one of these sites

387
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:34,084
to conduct a safety check.

388
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:37,254
In any case, the owner
and the bereaved reached a settlement,

389
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:41,800
so you shouldn't be
taking this up with me.

390
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:45,470
Then who else are we
supposed to ask if not you?

391
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:50,684
Yes, well, that aside,
we need some information regarding Min-uk.

392
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:54,146
Could we see the training log
he filled out at the time?

393
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:57,065
- Or anything else that could help…
- I don't know.

394
00:21:57,149 --> 00:22:00,277
Since then, we haven't been sending
any more students there.

395
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,988
We submitted his training log
during the investigation,

396
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:04,489
and no problems were found.

397
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:09,328
This was several years ago,
so why would you…

398
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:14,541
Are we done here?

399
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:20,172
I have a lesson to prepare for.

400
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:31,516
- I got through to Min-uk's mother.
- What?

401
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:38,982
When Min-uk was young,
his father died in an accident.

402
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:42,778
Min-uk was very close with his dad,

403
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:46,573
so I think of them being together now,

404
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,534
but I also get the feeling

405
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:54,081
that my husband's telling me off
for sending our boy so early.

406
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:56,541
I really…

407
00:22:57,834 --> 00:23:00,420
want to see him just once.

408
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,425
My wish…

409
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,929
is to join them as quickly as possible.

410
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,143
Your son's wish

411
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:18,063
is for you to live a healthy…

412
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:19,481
Well…

413
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:21,942
I don't know how to say this.

414
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,569
Ma'am,

415
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:28,073
we were told that
you reached a settlement with them.

416
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:31,243
I didn't know…

417
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:35,205
what else I could do other than settle.

418
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,333
I was told everyone just settles.

419
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:43,130
I changed my mind and tried to withdraw,
but I was told that wasn't possible.

420
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:47,425
They rushed you into settling
when you were unable to think clearly,

421
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:49,761
but we need to uncover the truth.

422
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:51,263
The truth?

423
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:53,849
About what?

424
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,977
They said it was just an accident.

425
00:23:57,727 --> 00:24:00,814
That my son
touched the machine by mistake.

426
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:07,946
I can't tell you the specifics
at this stage,

427
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:12,200
but a similar accident nearly happened
at that same factory

428
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:16,121
because they haven't been following
safety regulations

429
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:17,956
even after Min-uk's accident.

430
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:22,419
So we plan on setting things right.

431
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:24,379
And if you do?

432
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,716
Will that bring my son back?

433
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:30,802
Sorry? Ma'am, we…

434
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:32,846
Well…

435
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:38,977
Just thinking about it breaks my heart,
so I don't want to revisit it.

436
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:41,479
I want to just forget about it.

437
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,064
- I…
- At least…

438
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:48,111
much later…

439
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:54,201
when you meet Min-uk again,
you'll have something to tell him.

440
00:24:58,121 --> 00:25:00,332
That he helped make the world better.

441
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:14,930
LABOR ATTORNEY NO MU-JIN

442
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:20,143
<i>I don't know if they'll help,</i>
<i>but please return them when you're done.</i>

443
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,651
What was with those tears earlier?

444
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,029
I don't know. It just happened.

445
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:34,783
Is this what sincerity looks like?

446
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,788
You're not secretly smart
but pretending to be dumb, are you?

447
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,665
Am I?

448
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:43,917
Geez. Of course not.

449
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,335
Am I smart?

450
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:47,837
Did you find anything in there?

451
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:50,215
- Of course not.
- True.

452
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:53,260
They probably made sure
everything looked fine on paper.

453
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:55,595
What a letdown.

454
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:59,140
I didn't have high hopes
when we got the accident report,

455
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,059
but it's just too clean.

456
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:04,062
And they kindly delivered it
to the bereaved.

457
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:05,188
Man…

458
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:07,440
Then is there nothing else we can do?

459
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:22,956
Wait a minute.

460
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:29,504
At 23:50 hours?

461
00:26:29,587 --> 00:26:31,047
Oh, that's right.

462
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:34,092
That day was
the first day of the Chuseok holiday.

463
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:37,846
They made him work over the holidays
instead of sending him home.

464
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:42,350
These bastards are totally busted.

465
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,102
What is it?

466
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:57,741
Why are you looking at me like that?

467
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:05,248
Work undercover? Me? Why?

468
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:07,334
They already know our faces.

469
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:11,713
You were doing a number two,
so they don't know your face.

470
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:14,924
Well, I suppose that's true, but…

471
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:18,261
No offense to people in that line of work,

472
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:22,557
but my looks
scream intelligence and glamor,

473
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,934
so no one would buy it.

474
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:26,561
That's why we're here.

475
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:27,729
Yup.

476
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:33,985
- Mu-jin.
- Yeah?

477
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:35,612
No?

478
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:36,654
Where are you going?

479
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:40,033
There's nothing better out there.
Just come in.

480
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:41,201
We've got quality.

481
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,161
Let's take a look.

482
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:52,587
Take him inside.

483
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:56,257
- What are you doing?
- What's he doing?

484
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:58,093
This isn't…

485
00:27:58,176 --> 00:27:59,886
This isn't my vibe.

486
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:07,685
- Not bad.
- It's bad.

487
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:09,062
What is this, a runway?

488
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,109
It looks off.

489
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,318
- It is.
- It is.

490
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:22,075
- It's tacky.
- Yeah, it really is.

491
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:25,245
I think we need professional help.

492
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:28,164
How about it? Want my help?

493
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:30,500
What's the occasion?

494
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:36,464
I'm racking up so much good karma today.

495
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,258
I've nailed it.

496
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:39,592
It says Kim Guk-jin…

497
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:41,720
Don't mind that. That's my ex-husband.

498
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:43,972
Wow, this is perfect.

499
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:47,183
- Amazing, aren't I?
- Totally amazing.

500
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:49,352
Time to open your wallet.

501
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,479
Mu-jin, open your wallet.

502
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:54,399
PRODUCTION STAFF WANTED

503
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:00,196
RÉSUMÉ

504
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:10,623
Have you done this kind of work before?

505
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:13,668
I don't look it, right?

506
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,587
No, you really do.

507
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:19,674
You see, we don't pay more money
just because you're experienced.

508
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:23,720
Hey, what are you doing?

509
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:25,722
You're not filming with that, are you?

510
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:28,933
Don't you have something smaller?
Like a tiny hidden camera?

511
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,310
The right equipment is key.

512
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:32,896
I do. All charged and ready too.

513
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:35,982
That's what I asked you to grab
on your way out.

514
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:39,277
I didn't know that was a camera.

515
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,237
You should've made that clear.

516
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:43,698
I did make that clear, but you…

517
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:50,038
I should've brought it.
I was in a rush, so I forgot.

518
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:53,750
We'll be on video call
and recording everything on the tablet,

519
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:57,086
so, Gyeon-u,
you just need to stay sharp, okay?

520
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:59,881
This is killing my vibe.

521
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:01,841
- Get over yourself!
- Get over yourself!

522
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,261
Okay, well. Sure.

523
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:08,139
You can go.
Our factory manager will show you around.

524
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:15,855
- Excuse me, Director.
- Yeah?

525
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:18,107
Aren't we signing an employment contract?

526
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:20,777
A contract?

527
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:22,612
Yes.

528
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:26,241
<i>You might not even show up after today,</i>

529
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:28,910
<i>so let's see for a few days,</i>
<i>then we can sign one.</i>

530
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:32,956
No written employment contract.

531
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:42,966
Kim Guk-jin?

532
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:44,467
Right, let's go.

533
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:49,764
Have you cooked rice before?

534
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,766
Only with a rice cooker.

535
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,226
Then it's fine.

536
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:55,228
It's all the same, okay?

537
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:56,896
Press the start button,

538
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,649
watch it work for a bit,
then press the stop button.

539
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:02,652
That's all there is to it.
You just need to press the buttons.

540
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:04,487
Excuse me…

541
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:07,282
Don't I get any safety training?

542
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:10,493
You just did.

543
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:11,452
Follow me.

544
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,204
Is he allowed to do that?

545
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:18,042
What is it? Why are you watching it again?

546
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:20,795
They use press brakes here,

547
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:23,506
but if they don't even train new hires,

548
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:28,344
they probably skip the biannual training
for workplaces with over five employees.

549
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:31,890
Under Article 29 of the OSH Act,
that's a fine of up to 35 million won.

550
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:33,725
- Mu-jin.
- Yeah?

551
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:36,769
- You really are a labor attorney.
- I'm a licensed professional.

552
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:38,354
Impressive.

553
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:43,568
But damn… This machine…

554
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:44,903
What about it?

555
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:49,365
- It's the one that killed Min-uk.
- What? This one?

556
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:51,451
It's got a lot of issues,

557
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:53,286
but they're still using it.

558
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,247
You need to be careful with that.

559
00:31:56,331 --> 00:32:00,084
One wrong move and everyone gets hurt.

560
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:05,965
We use him because he's cheap,
but he can't really speak Korean,

561
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:07,675
and he's not very good at the job.

562
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:11,846
I can't even tell
if he understands my instructions.

563
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,848
Then you can hire Koreans…

564
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:17,644
What? Young people don't want
to work in places like this.

565
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:20,939
We used to hire kids on work placements,

566
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:23,107
but something happened,
so we don't anymore.

567
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:25,109
What happened?

568
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:28,905
Oh, just something. Come this way.

569
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:30,823
Hey, Nimal.

570
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:36,496
He'll be working here from today,
so make sure you teach him proper.

571
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:38,247
Got it?

572
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:40,708
Did you understand me?

573
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,211
Yes!

574
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:49,258
It's not "proper."

575
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:50,885
It's "properly"!

576
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:52,971
You're good at Korean.

577
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,891
I had a good teacher.

578
00:32:58,184 --> 00:33:02,146
But you pretend not to understand
in front of the chief?

579
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:06,067
That way, he gets frustrated
and gives me less work.

580
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,864
Now, come around slowly and safely.

581
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:13,658
- Okay.
- Hey, Nimal!

582
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:16,077
If you're done teaching him, come here!

583
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:18,496
Okay, I come!

584
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:30,508
<i>Good to see you,</i>
<i>all you patriotic citizens out there.</i>

585
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:34,762
<i>Today, I'll be explaining why</i>
<i>Korean archery is out of this world.</i>

586
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:39,058
<i>The world's been left speechless at how</i>
<i>Korean archery swept all the medals.</i>

587
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:42,353
<i>Well, it turns out</i>
<i>the secret may be in our very DNA,</i>

588
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:43,938
<i>according to a paper published…</i>

589
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,152
<i>As descendants of the archer Chumong,</i>

590
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:52,196
<i>I'm sure you know</i>
<i>that this runs in our DNA.</i>

591
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,281
<i>But wait!</i>

592
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:55,324
<i>According to a recent study from Harvard,</i>

593
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:58,828
<i>Korean DNA has</i>
<i>around 39% better aim and balance</i>

594
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:00,997
<i>than other ethnic groups,</i>

595
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,291
<i>all based on scientific research.</i>

596
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:05,126
<i>Also, as metal-chopstick users…</i>

597
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:14,427
He needs to get closer to Nimal.

598
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:17,180
Exactly. Why is he being so slow?

599
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:23,936
Wow, you're really well-built.

600
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,980
You must've worked here a long time.

601
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:30,026
Why are you here?

602
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:30,943
What?

603
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:32,445
To work.

604
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:37,950
Why?

605
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:40,870
Oh, this phone?

606
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:42,830
It's a new model.

607
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:45,124
You've… never seen it before, right?

608
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:46,751
I know you're filming with that.

609
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:49,962
You're with the people
who came the other day.

610
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:52,340
The other day? I don't know…

611
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:57,678
Well, the thing is…

612
00:34:58,304 --> 00:34:59,722
I'm here to help.

613
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:00,807
Help?

614
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:02,475
How?

615
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:03,559
Well…

616
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:07,563
By exposing the dangerous working
conditions and punishing the--

617
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:11,400
If I lose my job here, I'll be deported.

618
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:14,153
You know what "deported" means?

619
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,447
Yes, of course.

620
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,825
Please just leave.

621
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:21,160
I'm fine.

622
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:24,872
Remember Min-uk?

623
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,334
Min-uk?

624
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:31,003
He used to work here.

625
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:38,970
You two were close.

626
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:41,889
No!

627
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:43,933
You were roommates.

628
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:46,394
The colleague you lived
and worked with died.

629
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,858
So, please, tell me what you know
about his accident.

630
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:56,529
I have nothing to say.
I don't know anything.

631
00:35:56,612 --> 00:36:00,074
The day of his accident
wasn't September 30th, was it?

632
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:02,326
He's already dead!

633
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,037
Why does the date matter?

634
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:06,956
It does matter. A lot.

635
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:07,915
Just a day…

636
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:11,919
No, by just a few minutes,
they avoided legal punishment--

637
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,796
Enough chatter!

638
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:16,674
Unless you want to be
thrown out without pay!

639
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:18,384
Oh, sorry.

640
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:22,555
I was just asking questions.

641
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:32,148
TODAY'S SAVINGS: 63 WON

642
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:35,651
- Enjoying yourself?
- Jesus!

643
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:37,361
I thought you were going to sleep.

644
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:40,573
You blew all that money
and you're happy saving up pennies?

645
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:42,366
Don't underestimate cashback apps.

646
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:45,203
I bought you that iced Americano
last time with this.

647
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:47,705
Wow, great. Thank you. It was delicious.

648
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:54,045
Mu-jin, that car's going into the factory.

649
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:55,546
Whose car is that?

650
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:58,966
It's a nice car. Maybe it's the owner.

651
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,344
Do you think they recognized our car?

652
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:03,846
No way. I'm sure they didn't notice.

653
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:19,195
There are systems in place
to protect whistleblowers.

654
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:21,530
We'll make sure you don't get…

655
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:23,282
I don't know anything.

656
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:26,452
So stop following me around.

657
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,006
Have a look at this.

658
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:41,509
What is it?

659
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:43,678
Min-uk's notebook.

660
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,137
It mentions you.

661
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:53,062
LEE MIN-UK

662
00:37:58,317 --> 00:37:59,610
MIN-UK'S PLAN

663
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:01,362
4. VISIT NIMAL'S HOMETOWN

664
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:09,996
NIMAL'S AND MY GO-TO MENU
CUP NOODLES, RICE BALLS, BANANA MILK

665
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:17,545
NIMAL IS FROM SRI LANKA!

666
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:24,635
I WANT TO VISIT HIS HOMETOWN

667
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,475
He must've been really fond of you.

668
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,984
STUDYING KOREAN!

669
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:47,825
ALWAYS CHEERFUL WHEN TALKING WITH HIS MOM

670
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:58,461
Where are you going?

671
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,588
We can't be away for long.

672
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:04,258
What's this doing out here?

673
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:07,386
It should be outside!
Why did you put it here?

674
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,971
Hey! Move this!

675
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:12,892
He looks new.

676
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:15,394
Who is he? A new hire?

677
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:18,564
Oh, I interviewed him this morning
and let him start.

678
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:22,318
You should answer
when someone talks to you!

679
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:24,695
Oh, me?

680
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:26,030
How did you know about us?

681
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:28,908
Oh, while looking through job postings.

682
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:30,785
How did you get here?

683
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:33,245
Oh, by… bus.

684
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:34,163
Hold on.

685
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:36,374
There's no bus stop here.

686
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:39,210
Oh, well…

687
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:42,338
Something's shady about this kid.

688
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:43,255
Hey!

689
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:44,840
Who the hell are you?

690
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:47,551
This person!

691
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:52,807
He's friends with those
labor attorney people from before!

692
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:55,393
What are you talking about?
You don't even know me.

693
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:56,685
I saw you!

694
00:39:56,769 --> 00:40:00,064
- You were taking a dump outside!
- What?

695
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:02,024
Hey, is that true?

696
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:05,778
That's ridiculous.

697
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:08,239
Why would I take a dump outside
like a dog?

698
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,825
You were all in cahoots.

699
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:13,786
I let you off once,
but you came crawling back?

700
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:16,664
Oh no! He got caught!

701
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:18,165
- Start the car!
<i>- Come here.</i>

702
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:20,960
Hey, get him!

703
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:23,921
Anyone who catches him
will get a 100,000-won bonus!

704
00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:25,297
Get him!

705
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:29,718
Get him!

706
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:50,656
That hurts.

707
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:53,868
Make that 300,000 won!

708
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:55,911
Get him!

709
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:09,341
Damn it.

710
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:38,829
Wait!

711
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:53,135
- Get him!
- Darn it.

712
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:00,851
Gyeon-u, get in quickly!

713
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:01,936
Get in!

714
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:15,324
It's the police!

715
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:17,284
Here! It's them!

716
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,121
Gyeonjjang TV?

717
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,707
Are you my subscriber?

718
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:26,418
Hey, you!

719
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:28,712
I knew you were shady from the start.

720
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:32,341
We're not shady people.

721
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:33,759
We're content creators.

722
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:36,929
We visit places
with unsafe working environments

723
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:40,349
and expose the truth in our videos.

724
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:43,894
So we're doing this
in the public interest.

725
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:46,939
I know that views make you money,

726
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:50,276
but you can't just barge into
someone's place of business like this.

727
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:52,987
Listen, Officer. Never mind all that.

728
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,573
We have work to do,
so just take them all in.

729
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:57,741
Unbelievable.

730
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:59,952
These people here
are exploitative employers.

731
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:03,163
- They don't respect safety regulations!
- Hey, scammer.

732
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:05,833
Who are you calling exploitative?

733
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:10,921
Also, do you have even proof?

734
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:12,089
Proof?

735
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:14,383
What if we do?

736
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:15,301
Gyeon-u.

737
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:20,055
It's all recorded in here.

738
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,726
What's wrong with this?

739
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:24,643
What's going on?

740
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:26,729
What's wrong with it? Is the battery dead?

741
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:28,397
The tablet. We saved it on there.

742
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,398
That's enough.

743
00:43:29,898 --> 00:43:32,818
This is for the labor office
or the safety authorities.

744
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:35,279
If you trespass
and record illegally like this,

745
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:38,157
you could be charged
with trespassing or obstruction.

746
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,492
In 2020, at this very factory,

747
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:42,870
a high school boy died
during his work placement.

748
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:44,121
We came here to uncover…

749
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:47,249
But why are you folks the ones doing that?

750
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:48,208
Because…

751
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:54,173
It's different from what I know.

752
00:43:54,256 --> 00:43:55,424
Come on.

753
00:43:55,507 --> 00:43:58,927
We already settled the matter
with his family,

754
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:03,557
so why are you digging into it again?

755
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,351
You're saying a student in training

756
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:07,436
operated a machine
without any instructions

757
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:08,937
and got into an accident?

758
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,109
You expect me to believe that?

759
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,571
How could you do that?

760
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,198
He was a young student.

761
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:21,283
The kind we adults should protect!

762
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:23,452
He died because of his own mistake.

763
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:27,373
Why should the company care
about some brat who got himself killed

764
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:30,292
doing something no one told him to do?

765
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:32,628
What are you…

766
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:34,129
He didn't get himself killed!

767
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:40,260
And the company made him work!

768
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:43,472
What are you doing, you piece of shit?

769
00:44:43,555 --> 00:44:46,392
My friend's name isn't "some brat"!

770
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:48,477
It's Min-uk! Lee Min-uk!

771
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:50,062
And me!

772
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:54,108
I'm not a "piece of shit."
I'm Nimal. My name is Nimal!

773
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:57,569
Hey, you don't know anything,
so stay out of this.

774
00:44:57,653 --> 00:44:59,571
You can't even speak Korean!

775
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:00,989
My friend…

776
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:03,200
was alive.

777
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:05,077
He could've lived.

778
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:07,538
But they killed him!

779
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:09,456
This is ridiculous.

780
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,208
Hey! Bring him inside.

781
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:16,880
What are you talking about?
He could've survived, but they killed him?

782
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:19,466
How? How did they kill him?

783
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:21,176
Hey!

784
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:23,846
Don't say another word and get lost.

785
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:25,931
Get lost, you bastard!

786
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:41,071
<i>"Have you eaten?"</i>

787
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:42,865
"Have you had your meal?"

788
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:43,782
"You ate?"

789
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:45,492
It's all the same.

790
00:45:47,035 --> 00:45:48,537
And the one you find difficult.

791
00:45:49,204 --> 00:45:51,498
"I appreciate your help." Repeat after me.

792
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:54,084
I appreciate your help.

793
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:55,127
Good job!

794
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:57,296
Your pronunciation
just needs a little work.

795
00:45:57,379 --> 00:45:58,672
Anyway,

796
00:45:58,755 --> 00:46:01,467
people in Korea
always ask if you've eaten.

797
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:05,554
You should try asking that
when you talk to people.

798
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:07,139
And…

799
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:10,100
If you're in trouble,
don't keep it to yourself.

800
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:11,560
Ask for help.

801
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:14,062
Say, "I'd appreciate your help."

802
00:46:14,771 --> 00:46:15,606
Okay.

803
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,609
Korea is so cold.

804
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:23,405
What will you do if you're cold already?
It's only September.

805
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:25,657
In seven minutes,

806
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:27,826
it will be "Otober."

807
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:30,412
"October," not "Otober."

808
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:35,542
You're right. Time really flies.

809
00:46:36,251 --> 00:46:38,253
Chuseok. Go home?

810
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:40,631
Lots of good food?

811
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:43,884
Of course. My mom makes killer <i>galbi.</i>

812
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:46,261
I'll bring some back for you.

813
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:47,763
Thank you!

814
00:46:47,846 --> 00:46:49,723
I appreciate your help.

815
00:46:49,806 --> 00:46:52,184
- I appreciate your help.
- I appreciate your help.

816
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:55,479
Hey, Lee Min-uk. Come quickly.

817
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:58,482
Why? I still have time until my shift.

818
00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:00,025
The press brake stopped.

819
00:47:00,108 --> 00:47:02,528
We're busy enough,
but the machine's acting up.

820
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:04,863
Come on, get a move on. Check the machine.

821
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:07,157
We need to do this
for you to go home tomorrow.

822
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:09,660
- Okay.
- Hurry up!

823
00:47:12,871 --> 00:47:13,872
Director!

824
00:47:15,123 --> 00:47:16,333
We've got a problem!

825
00:47:16,416 --> 00:47:18,043
There's been an accident!

826
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:19,127
An accident?

827
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:20,671
The press brake.

828
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:23,757
Min-uk's arm got caught,
and he got sucked in.

829
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:27,719
If he got sucked in, just pull him out.
What's the fuss?

830
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:31,306
The machine's not working,
so we can't get him out!

831
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:33,267
What's the big deal? Let's go!

832
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:35,602
You should just pull him out…

833
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:37,104
One, two!

834
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:40,732
One, two, three!

835
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:41,984
One, two!

836
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:44,570
I'll help you.

837
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:46,238
Min-uk!

838
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:47,489
Min-uk!

839
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:48,407
Nimal…

840
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:49,950
Where's my phone?

841
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:51,326
God damn it, Chief.

842
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:55,706
Hey, boss, we've had an accident!

843
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:56,915
Here. Hey, move!

844
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:58,458
Move, you bastard!

845
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:00,294
Can you see that?

846
00:48:01,086 --> 00:48:02,337
Help…

847
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:04,089
Please help.

848
00:48:04,172 --> 00:48:07,551
His body's been sucked in halfway.
What do we…

849
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:12,139
Min-uk.

850
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:13,390
Lift it! Hurry up!

851
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:16,101
What do we do?

852
00:48:16,184 --> 00:48:18,228
Should we call 911?

853
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:21,940
<i>Don't you know we get fined</i>
<i>for making a student work at night?</i>

854
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:23,942
<i>And it's the holidays right now!</i>

855
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:28,030
Besides, his body's stuck in there.
He won't survive that.

856
00:48:28,113 --> 00:48:31,533
<i>Even if he makes it out alive,</i>
<i>if he starts filing claims,</i>

857
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:34,119
we're finished!

858
00:48:34,202 --> 00:48:36,496
Then what do we do? Do we just…

859
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,248
Do we just leave him to die?

860
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:39,207
<i>First,</i>

861
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:43,587
<i>make sure the other workers keep</i>
<i>their mouths shut and send them home.</i>

862
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:45,213
Nimal, please…

863
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:48,967
<i>We have to make it look like he got stuck</i>
<i>while doing maintenance alone.</i>

864
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:49,885
Don't die.

865
00:48:49,968 --> 00:48:50,802
<i>Chief Kang!</i>

866
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:52,054
<i>You get me?</i>

867
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:53,805
Yes, understood, sir.

868
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:55,390
<i>When it's done,</i>

869
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:57,768
<i>take him to the hospital</i>
<i>in the company car.</i>

870
00:48:58,435 --> 00:48:59,770
<i>It must be the company car.</i>

871
00:48:59,853 --> 00:49:01,730
<i>Calling 911 will leave a record.</i>

872
00:49:01,813 --> 00:49:02,981
Okay…

873
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:04,858
Wait, Dad!

874
00:49:04,941 --> 00:49:06,610
When what's done?

875
00:49:06,693 --> 00:49:08,487
When he dies.

876
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:09,905
When he's dead!

877
00:49:10,572 --> 00:49:11,406
<i>Got it?</i>

878
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:17,162
Okay, I got it.

879
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:23,543
Damn it!

880
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:27,714
Please! I'd appreciate your help!

881
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:29,007
I'd appreciate your help!

882
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:30,342
What help?

883
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:33,095
Ambulance? Hey, get lost.

884
00:49:36,973 --> 00:49:38,141
Now!

885
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:40,102
Listen up, okay?

886
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:42,729
You didn't work today, got it?

887
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:46,066
Yesterday at 11:00 p.m.,

888
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:48,402
you finished your shifts, okay?

889
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:51,697
I'll sort things out here, so you…

890
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:53,949
Hey, put him down.

891
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:56,535
It's fine now, so put him down.

892
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:58,203
You all go home. Go rest.

893
00:49:58,286 --> 00:50:00,622
- Go!
- Please, ambulance…

894
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:01,790
Go, you bastards!

895
00:50:01,873 --> 00:50:04,459
Go! Report this
and I'll have you lot deported!

896
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:07,629
Why aren't you doing as you're told?

897
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:09,047
Go, you piece of shit!

898
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:10,465
Go!

899
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:12,509
Go.

900
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:24,855
Please help me…

901
00:50:26,481 --> 00:50:27,649
Mom…

902
00:51:05,103 --> 00:51:06,646
My friend, Min-uk…

903
00:51:07,355 --> 00:51:08,523
He was alive.

904
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:11,568
He could've lived…

905
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:15,572
but he died.

906
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,742
What's he talking about?

907
00:51:20,285 --> 00:51:23,789
That video's fake. It's been manipulated.

908
00:51:23,872 --> 00:51:25,123
He used his phone to…

909
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:27,042
He died because of you!

910
00:51:27,125 --> 00:51:28,627
Don't you see us?

911
00:51:29,294 --> 00:51:31,046
We're the evidence and witnesses!

912
00:51:31,129 --> 00:51:32,005
He's right!

913
00:51:32,088 --> 00:51:33,465
We saw it.

914
00:51:34,716 --> 00:51:37,511
Disregard for the standard
work placement agreement,

915
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:40,680
violation of regulations
restricting night and holiday shifts,

916
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:45,477
failure to respond to injury,
resulting in death,

917
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:48,438
as well as covering up the site
and falsification of records.

918
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:55,862
I don't know what you're talking about.

919
00:51:56,905 --> 00:52:00,158
We've already settled
with the kid's family,

920
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:02,619
and nothing was wrong legally,

921
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:04,162
so why are you butting in?

922
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:07,165
Even if you reached a settlement
in the civil suit,

923
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:09,251
you still have to face criminal charges.

924
00:52:11,419 --> 00:52:15,382
You wrote in the accident report
that on September 30th at 23:50 hours,

925
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:18,093
Lee Min-uk got stuck in the machine
and died instantly,

926
00:52:18,176 --> 00:52:21,930
but the accident happened
on October 1st at 00:05,

927
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:26,685
and according to the video,
he was alive until 00:20 hours.

928
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:28,311
So what?

929
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:30,021
What about it?

930
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:33,733
It doesn't change the fact that
he died from his own mistake!

931
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:36,820
You changed the dates
because you knew it did change something.

932
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:38,363
Why?

933
00:52:38,446 --> 00:52:40,240
From October 1st, 2020,

934
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:43,410
special provisions to protect students
came into effect.

935
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:46,246
Under Article 166-2 of the OSH Act,

936
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:50,208
if a student dies due to an employer's
violation of safety regulations,

937
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:52,377
in accordance with Article 167,

938
00:52:53,169 --> 00:52:57,007
they may face up to seven years in prison
or a fine of up to 100 million won.

939
00:52:58,174 --> 00:53:00,218
Wait, hold on.

940
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:02,679
Seven years? Are you kidding me?

941
00:53:02,762 --> 00:53:03,763
I'm not.

942
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:05,181
There's more.

943
00:53:05,807 --> 00:53:07,684
Concealing a workplace accident.

944
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:10,520
You gave his family
a falsified accident report.

945
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:13,023
That's a violation
of Article 57, Paragraph 1.

946
00:53:13,106 --> 00:53:15,233
Under Article 170,

947
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:18,320
anyone who conceals or conspires
to conceal a workplace accident

948
00:53:18,403 --> 00:53:21,656
may face up to one year in prison
or a fine of up to 10 million won.

949
00:53:23,658 --> 00:53:25,243
You scumbags.

950
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:26,703
You're done for!

951
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:29,247
You!

952
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:30,415
You bastard!

953
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:40,759
Why…

954
00:53:42,427 --> 00:53:43,929
- You just hit him!
- Gyeon-u.

955
00:53:44,012 --> 00:53:45,430
We'll file an assault charge!

956
00:53:45,513 --> 00:53:48,725
And they might try to run,
so you should arrest them right now!

957
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:51,269
I didn't even punch him that hard.

958
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:52,312
You've got it wrong!

959
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:55,023
Let go of me!

960
00:53:55,106 --> 00:53:56,441
How dare you hit him?

961
00:53:56,524 --> 00:53:58,443
Let go! Dad!

962
00:53:58,526 --> 00:54:01,279
Were you going to dodge that?
You need to take it.

963
00:54:01,863 --> 00:54:03,990
- Did you push him?
- Yeah, on purpose.

964
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:07,744
Oh, you pushed him? She pushed you. I see.

965
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:08,662
Are you okay?

966
00:54:09,996 --> 00:54:10,914
You're fine.

967
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,124
Right. Let's go.

968
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:16,294
<i>In 2020, at a factory</i>
<i>in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province,</i>

969
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:21,091
<i>a high school student died</i>
<i>during his work placement.</i>

970
00:54:21,174 --> 00:54:24,928
<i>It was recently revealed that his death</i>
<i>involved safety regulation violations</i>

971
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:28,723
<i>as well as cover-ups and manipulations</i>
<i>by those in charge.</i>

972
00:54:28,807 --> 00:54:30,642
<i>The truth came to light</i>

973
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:34,479
<i>after crucial video evidence</i>
<i>was provided by a migrant worker.</i>

974
00:54:35,271 --> 00:54:36,398
I was too scared…

975
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:39,985
so I couldn't say anything.

976
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:43,154
He had to work every day
at the site where his friend had died.

977
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:44,823
It must've been hard for him.

978
00:54:44,906 --> 00:54:46,825
If only he'd reported it right away.

979
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:49,285
Those owners would've been
punished earlier too.

980
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:52,288
He could've been deported
if they fired him.

981
00:54:53,206 --> 00:54:56,710
And he wasn't good at Korean back then,
so it would've been hard.

982
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:59,629
But still, Min-uk helped him so much.

983
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:03,550
I think

984
00:55:04,759 --> 00:55:07,512
there are more people
than we realize in this world

985
00:55:08,346 --> 00:55:10,223
who can't choose how they live.

986
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:14,019
Good job, guys.

987
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:16,187
You were great too! Great job!

988
00:55:16,271 --> 00:55:18,273
<i>Cost-cutting corporate policies,</i>

00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:21,651

00:55:30,785 --> 00:55:33,997
Seriously, how much food does it take
to fill you two up?

994
00:55:35,331 --> 00:55:37,709
Yes, I got the beer.

995
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:50,680
Oh, right, boss.

996
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:53,600
You seem right at home.

997
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:56,770
I just dozed off.

998
00:55:58,104 --> 00:56:01,649
I unpacked the delivery and worked nonstop
without even a bathroom break.

999
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,318
Sir,

1000
00:56:03,401 --> 00:56:07,697
when will I get
my overtime pay from last month?

1001
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:09,699
It hasn't been paid in yet.

1002
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:12,202
I'll give it to you!
I'm not gonna stiff you.

1003
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:16,289
Kids these days
have no heart at all. Geez.

1004
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:18,666
Oh, my head.

1005
00:56:38,394 --> 00:56:39,646
That'll be 12,000 won.

1006
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:45,068
Want me to get your unpaid wages?

1007
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:50,740
I need your credit card, not this.

1008
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:56,412
Here.

1009
00:56:57,163 --> 00:56:58,039
Do you need a bag?

1010
00:56:58,123 --> 00:56:59,541
- How much?
- It's 100 won.

1011
00:56:59,624 --> 00:57:01,084
- No.
- Receipt?

1012
00:57:01,167 --> 00:57:02,001
How much is it?

1013
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:03,336
What?

1014
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:12,720

00:57:54,512 --> 00:57:56,347
<i>Why is Min-uk handsome?</i>

00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:00,226
<i>Me?</i>

1031
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:36,596
Of course.

Thank you.

1033
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:45,605
I don't have anything to offer you,

1034
00:58:47,106 --> 00:58:48,775
but at least stay for a meal.

1035
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:52,695
No, we're okay. We should go.
I'm sure you need to rest.

1036
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:53,613
Let's go.

1037
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:55,323
Actually…

1038
00:58:56,574 --> 00:58:57,742
Let's eat.

1039
00:58:58,576 --> 00:59:01,204
I'm hungry. Yes, that'd be nice, ma'am.

1040
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:02,121
Okay.

1041
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:17,679
What is this?

1042
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:20,181
It's delicious.

1043
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:24,394
So delicious.

1044
00:59:24,477 --> 00:59:25,562
Have more.

1045
00:59:26,437 --> 00:59:27,272
It's so good.

1046
00:59:27,355 --> 00:59:29,023
- Have some too, ma'am.
- Okay.

1047
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:34,487
I ate way too much.

1048
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:36,114
- Thank you.
- It was delicious.

1049
00:59:36,197 --> 00:59:38,992
How did you marinate that?
It was so delicious.

1050

I'm grateful you liked it.

1051
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:47,125
Seeing you eat so well
reminded me of Min-uk.

1052
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:49,168
Oh, this is embarrassing.

1053
00:59:50,336 --> 00:59:52,922
I can die happy now.

1054
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:54,299
Please, ma'am!

1055
00:59:54,382 --> 00:59:58,928
You need to think of Min-uk
and live a healthy, happy life.

1056
00:59:59,512 --> 01:00:00,638
- I should.
- Yes.

1057
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:03,808
Thanks to you,

1058
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:07,395
my son would've found some peace.

1059
01:00:10,064 --> 01:00:11,149
Thank you so much.

1060
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:16,487
- Please stay healthy.
- I will.

1061
01:00:17,405 --> 01:00:18,239
Thank you.

1062
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:21,284
- You should go in.
- Okay.

1063
01:00:21,367 --> 01:00:22,785
- We'll get going.
- Bye.

1064
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:29,626
Oh, right.

1065
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:39,469
Seon-hui.

1066
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:58,047
Goodness, what's wrong with me? I'm sorry.

1067
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:01,843
You should go.

1068
01:02:01,926 --> 01:02:02,927
You should go in.

1069
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:04,721
Okay.

1070
01:02:04,804 --> 01:02:06,264
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

1071
01:02:06,347 --> 01:02:07,515
You've got this!

1072
01:02:22,655 --> 01:02:23,489
<i>Thank you,</i>

1073
01:02:25,116 --> 01:02:26,033
<i>Mr. Labor Attorney.</i>

1074
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:31,414
You did great, boss.

1075
01:02:31,497 --> 01:02:32,623
I mean, brother-in-law.

1076
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:36,669
Yes. I really worked hard.

1077
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:40,256
I uploaded an edited version,
and we got a lot of subscribers.

1078
01:02:40,339 --> 01:02:41,924
But it's a shame.

1079
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:45,052
That clip of you getting punched
would attract more views.

1080
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:51,058
By the way,
is that contract thing over now?

1081
01:02:51,142 --> 01:02:52,685
Since you helped Min-uk move on?

1082
01:02:53,978 --> 01:02:54,812
I assume so.

1083
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:57,315
You don't see ghosts anymore?

1084
01:03:06,574 --> 01:03:07,408
No.

1085
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:09,494
I don't see them.

1086
01:03:10,203 --> 01:03:11,037
Great!

1087
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:14,290
We've been offtrack for a while,
so let's get back to work.

1088
01:03:14,373 --> 01:03:15,374
Congratulations.

1089
01:03:17,752 --> 01:03:18,586
Yes.

1090
01:03:20,421 --> 01:03:21,422
I'm free!

1091
01:04:06,425 --> 01:04:07,635
<i>Why did you appear again?</i>

1092
01:04:07,718 --> 01:04:09,095
Isn't our contract over now?

1093
01:04:09,178 --> 01:04:10,012
Says who?

1094
01:04:10,096 --> 01:04:10,972
<i>It's not over.</i>

1095
01:04:11,055 --> 01:04:13,224
Then, can you see ghosts here?

1096
01:04:13,307 --> 01:04:14,141
Jesus Christ!

1097
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:16,018
Are you a nurse?

1098
01:04:16,102 --> 01:04:17,854
What are you doing? Just talk to me.

1099
01:04:19,897 --> 01:04:21,607
<i>- Let's go.</i>
- Where?

1100
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:22,775
To take revenge.

1101
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:24,068
<i>Let's go to the hospital.</i>

1102
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:25,528
I found you.

1103
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:28,656
Why? I'm only a junior nurse!

1104
01:04:29,991 --> 01:04:31,158
Who are you?

1105
01:04:31,242 --> 01:04:33,077
<i>Seriously, why?</i>

1106
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:35,246
Why are you doing this to me?

1107
01:04:35,329 --> 01:04:37,999
<i>You won't understand her feelings</i>
<i>unless you've lived it.</i>

1108
01:04:40,793 --> 01:04:42,795
