1
00:00:57,932 --> 00:00:58,767
What is this?

2
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,603
Why did you appear again?

3
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:03,563
Isn't our contract over now?

4
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:04,647
Over?

5
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:07,358
Says who?

6
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:09,444
What do you mean?

7
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:11,946
I helped Min-uk find peace. So we're good.

8
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,910
I told you to help <i>souls</i> find peace
during the contract period, not just one.

9
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:19,829
Contract period?

10
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:22,624
I never saw such thing.

11
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:26,669
It was written in the contract.
See for yourself.

12
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:36,513
What is this?

13
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:40,475
"On duty 24 hours a day for six months"?

14
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:43,311
"Failure to help souls
will result in death"?

15
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:45,438
- That's ridiculous!
- You're right.

16
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:46,856
It's ridiculous.

17
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:49,734
The lifespan of concrete is 20 years,

18
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:52,862
but the replacement cycle
for utility poles is 30, which is…

19
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:54,739
truly ridiculous.

20
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:59,661
That's why they collapse,
and people get electrocuted.

21
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:02,413
Honestly,

22
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:05,291
it's been 50 years since I died,

23
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:07,752
but nothing has changed.

24
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,004
Fifty years?

25
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:12,966
Never mind. In any case!

26
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:16,177
This is an unfair deal!

27
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:17,595
This is fraud!

28
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:20,014
Unfair?

29
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:22,976
Unfair?

30
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,479
Do you know what's really unfair?

31
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:28,857
Back in my day,

32
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,860
people died from mercury poisoning
making thermometers by hand

33
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:35,196
and from tuberculosis
after working in sewing factories!

34
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,533
Plus, you said
you'd do anything if I spared you,

35
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:40,243
but now you're changing your tune?

36
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,245
What I mean is

37
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:46,374
will I have to keep helping
all these souls find peace?

38
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:47,959
Busting my ass like this?

39
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:52,672
Just fulfill the contract
for six months, as promised.

40
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:54,757
You won't be seeing me after that.

41
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:56,718
Oh, and…

42
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,096
watch your tone, will you?

43
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:02,932
You're a labor attorney
helping wronged workers pass on.

44
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,684
What's so unfair about that?

45
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,694
Hey, wait.

46
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,196
This…

47
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,573
CLAUSE 10

48
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,825
What's this?

49
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,953
What do you think? Special terms.

50
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:28,583
Special terms? Was this always here?

51
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:32,879
Yes, from the beginning.
You should've read it properly.

52
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:35,924
What?

53
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:43,723
Get with the times!
It's all in Chinese characters!

54
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,267
Wait! I haven't read everything!

55
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:50,396
I look forward to your continued help,
Mr. Labor Attorney.

56
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,526
Hey! You can't just leave like that!

57
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,198
I'm reporting you to the Labor Office!

58
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,868
Over my dead body!

59
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,377
His test results are all fine.

60
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,336
What?

61
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:14,921
Yes, he's good to go home.

62
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:18,591
Are you sure he's okay?
He was electrocuted.

63
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:21,594
He might look fine on the outside,

64
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,722
but his insides,
like his brain or organs, could be fried.

65
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,766
I mean, he's been talking nonsense.

66
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:28,977
Based on the results, he's fine.

67
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,397
You should take him home for now
and come back if there's a problem.

68
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:34,023
What?

69
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:38,528
Please follow me.
I'll explain the discharge process.

70
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:39,862
Right, okay.

71
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:42,532
They're sending you home. Get dressed.

72
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,242
It's not over.

73
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,327
What isn't?

74
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:48,579
The contract.

75
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:51,916
I have to keep going.

76
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:53,376
What contract?

77
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,964
Did you meet
that burning guy in jeans again?

78
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,804
What did he say?
Then can you see ghosts here right now?

79
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:10,810
Gosh.

80
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:17,191
That startled me.

81
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:20,111
Why is everyone sitting up?

82
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:22,196
What is it?

83
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,250
He's been hurt badly.

84
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:39,505
Let's go.

85
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:43,968
This is so exhausting.

86
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,136
Come on, hurry up.

87
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:49,515
You're amazing, big brother.

88
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:52,602
You got out before I even parked.
Shouldn't you be on TV?

89
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:56,481
Hey, can't you go for one second
without spouting nonsense?

90
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:58,441
It's probably what keeps him going.

91
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:03,029
Your sense of humor is back too.
You really are better. Let's go.

92
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:06,699
On we go.

93
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:07,617
Right.

94
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,536
Aside from seeing her, I should be fine.

95
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,498
- What the heck?
- What? Can you see her?

96
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,460
Why? Her hair looks great.

97
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,549
What is it? Are you feeling unwell?

98
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:26,260
I don't know.
Maybe it's the flu or a cold…

99
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:28,679
It's your tension wearing off.

100
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:31,390
Why not hit the sauna today
to get some rest?

101
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,893
- Right.
- The sauna? That sounds good.

102
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:54,789
It's seriously been a crazy few days.

103
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:57,291
I know. The most hectic it's been, right?

104
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,459
Yeah.

105
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:03,005
<i>The broadcast went well, thanks.</i>

106
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,715
- Hey.
- Yeah?

107
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,300
What was that reporter to you?

108
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,594
Yeo-jin? I just know her from college.

109
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,055
The way she looked at you says otherwise.

110
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,432
Are you jealous?

111
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:15,184
Then, are we an item from today?

112
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,186
Wanna be an item with my fist?

113
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:18,688
No.

114
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:21,441
- But we're really just friends.
- "We"?

115
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:23,526
I mean, her and me.

116
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:28,072
You really get on my nerves.
Your looks are your only saving grace.

117
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:31,993
- Looks, my foot!
- Jesus!

118
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:34,662
Your LASIK clearly went wrong.

119
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:37,123
- God, you startled me.
- Have you been well?

120
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:39,542
- Still streaming?
- Yes, I've been working hard.

121
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:43,379
I got 2,000 new subscribers this month,
so I'm close to the Silver Play Button.

122
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:48,342
You need to get your act together.
You're old enough now. Stop wasting time.

123
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:52,430
Big sister, with all due respect,
what you are saying is behind the times…

124
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:54,390
Hey! Just ignore her.

125
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,684
She's doing this
because you keep letting her.

126
00:07:56,767 --> 00:08:00,313
Who does she think she is?
Lawyers are a dime a dozen these days.

127
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:03,733
That remark is an insult
to all lawyers in this country.

128
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,818
Really? I'm so sorry.

129
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:08,488
Hey!

130
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:10,406
That's my…

131
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:14,160
- You got a death wish?
- No.

132
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:15,953
Who said you could wear that?

133
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:18,831
- Take it off.
- Here?

134
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,958
- Stop.
- I'm still paying for that!

135
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,169
- Wanna get slapped till it's paid?
- Let go.

136
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:24,420
- I'm telling you.
- Wait.

137
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,422
- Take it off right now.
- You let go.

138
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,299
Take it off! Right now!

139
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,307
Ladies! Let's please talk this out.

140
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,267
- You're a brute.
- Enough.

141
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,102
And you're a thief.

142
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:41,687
Stop it.

143
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:49,153
"Ghost-Seeing Labor Attorney."

144
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,531
"Corrupt Employer Taken Down."

145
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,617
You guys are unbelievable.

146
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:58,412
Enjoying that, are you?

147
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:01,374
Yeah, it's so good that I'd kill for it.

148
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,126
You really have
a way with words, don't you?

149
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,963
I have you to thank for that.

150
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:09,173
I learned so much from you.

151
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:16,013
I'd love to have you two on my channel.

152
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,598
"Classic Sisters."

153
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,767
This will get a million views easily.

154
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:21,936
- Shut up.
- Shut up.

155
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:22,853
Okay.

156
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:28,359
Did you subscribe and like our video?

157
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,363
You two are pathetic.

158
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,740
Can't you be nice?

159
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:39,412
Speaking as a professional,

160
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:42,498
you might get sued
if you keep sticking your noses in.

161
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:46,043
Please don't worry.
We don't cross the line.

162
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:49,171
Don't come to me for legal help.

163
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,674
You say that
like you have something better to do.

164
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,051
Hey, stop drinking.

165
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,804
Do you know what really pisses me off?

166
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:59,765
She failed the bar twice
and barely passed,

167
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,310
but she thinks she's all that now.

168
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:03,769
That's enough. I mean it.

169
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,229
"That's enough. I mean it."

170
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:06,731
"That's enough. I mean it."

171
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,865
- One more bottle of soju, please.
- Okay.

172
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:21,495
Ma'am, she'll bring it back tomorrow.

173
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:24,081
All right, sure. Go on home now.

174
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,249
- Okay.
- Sure.

175
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,209
- I'm cold.
- Hui-joo, wear this.

176
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:31,130
I don't want to.
This is so annoying. What is this?

177
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:32,173
Come on. Please.

178
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:35,009
You can't go outside wearing just that.
Not at this hour.

179
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:37,428
Hey, you carry this.

180
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:42,558
Hey, why do you care what I wear outside?

181
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,144
You'll get arrested, for public indecency.

182
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:46,437
Right, Attorney Na?

183
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,106
Yeah, it's an assault. On my eyes.

184
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:52,234
Hey! Na Mi-joo, seriously!

185
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,569
Ow, my ears!

186
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:58,324
Minor Offenses Act, Article 3,
Paragraph 1, public disturbance!

187
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:02,161
Punishable by a fine of up to 100,000 won,
detention, or a summary fine.

188
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:05,331
You'll get maybe 30,000 won?

189
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,041
As if.

190
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:10,378
You think you're a judge or something?
You're just a lowly lawyer.

191
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:12,505
- Your Honor.
- Lowly lawyer?

192
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:13,714
That's right.

193
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,257
Criminal insult.

194
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:19,095
Wow, she's in big trouble.
May I arrest her and take her home?

195
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:22,056
Yes, you may take her home.

196
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:24,350
But not yours. Our home.

197
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:25,351
Yes, ma'am.

198
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:28,396
- There is no "our home."
- Careful, Hui-joo.

199
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:31,023
God, my brother-in-law,
labor attorney No Mu-jin.

200
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,316
I feel so sorry for him.

201
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,737
- Marrying someone like that…
- If you can, make her shut up.

202
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:37,822
Yes, ma'am.

203
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,784
Did that hurt? I'm sorry.

204
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,870
You should go to the hospital.

205
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:47,039
To get your rabies shot.

206
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,625
Do you ever stop?

207
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,627
You turn into a dog whenever you drink.

208
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,087
God, seriously…

209
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:02,805
Jesus Christ!

210
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:05,641
What the…

211
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:16,485
What?

212
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:26,454
Wait…

213
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:29,665
Hey, seriously!

214
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,418
- What are you doing?
- So sorry.

215
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,753
- Sorry.
- Geez.

216
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:35,671
No, but…

217
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:37,548
There was…

218
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,509
definitely a…

219
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:16,420
This is straight-up gaslighting.

220
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:06,929
Geez.

221
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:27,157
Hey…

222
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:30,703
If you have something to say, just say it.

223
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:33,998
Why do you keep creeping me out like that?

224
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:41,547
Are you a nurse?

225
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:48,137
You followed me from the hospital, right?

226
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:51,515
Wait, what…

227
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:55,102
What are you doing? Just talk to me.

What are you doing? Just talk to me.

231
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:16,457
Eun-yeong, please. We can talk…

232
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,215
Oh, my head.

233
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:30,387
What is this?

234
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:35,434
Na Mi-joo is so annoying!

235
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:41,523
You're still in bed at this hour.

236
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:42,691
I told you to knock.

237
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,277
I should just get rid of this door.

238
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:48,864
I'm hungover as it is.
Don't make it worse.

239
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,660
Aren't you going to work?

240
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:55,412
Ppokku?

241
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:58,248
Here, Ppokku. There you are. Come here.

242
00:15:58,332 --> 00:15:59,333
"Hui-joo."

243
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,336
"Wake up, Hui-joo, wake up."

244
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:04,588
You told me not to work with Mu-jin!

245
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,632
So why do you care?

246
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:10,052
Don't you have to meet
to plot your next scam?

247
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,887
Seriously…

248
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,977
Stop glaring at me,

249
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,646
get out of bed,
and clean up Ppokku's pee pads.

250
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:21,981
And take her on a walk.

251
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:23,732
And give her a bath.

252
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,651
She needs to be groomed soon.

253
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:29,279
How does Ppokku have
a busier schedule than I do?

254
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:30,698
She wants to rest too.

255
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,743
Mu-jin at least cleaned up the dog poop.

256
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:36,495
God…

257
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:41,500
Then, go back and live

00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:51,093
She annoys me so much!

261
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:55,639
She treats us like we're scammers
or people who clean up dog poop.

262
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:57,558
I can't deal with this anymore.

263
00:16:58,434 --> 00:16:59,351
Actually,

264
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,771
why don't we take revenge?

265
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:08,444
Hey, are you listening to me?

266
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:11,739
Mu-jin!

267
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,121
Revenge?

268
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,248
Sounds good.

269
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:24,501
Let's go.

270
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:27,463
Where?

271
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:36,430
To take revenge.

272
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:41,560
Forget about revenge.
I think you should go to the hospital.

273
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:44,938
Yes, let's go there.

274
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:47,983
Come on, you're scaring me.

00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:51,111

276
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:54,239

Are you okay?

Mu-jin!

Hang in there, okay?

Mu-jin, we're here, okay?
Just hang in there.

That's it.

Mu-jin, we're here. Stay with me, okay?

287
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:53,382
So, what symptoms does he have?

288
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:57,803
He's been saying weird things
and having fits and stuff.

289
00:18:57,886 --> 00:18:58,804
What do we do?

290
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:02,808
He came yesterday
after being electrocuted, right?

291
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:03,725
Yes.

292
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,062
Sir, please open your eyes for a moment.

293
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:12,818
Don't look at me, but look up.

294
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:19,783
Okay, please stick your tongue out.

295
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:21,869
I found you.

296
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:23,662
Sorry?

297
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,039
Found what?

298
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,042
You.

299
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:32,754
- Mu-jin, what are you doing?
- Why?

300
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,256
Why did you do that to me?

301
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:37,384
- Why? Why did you do it?
- What are you doing?

302
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:39,386
Sir, let go of me.

303
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,055
- Let go…
- Mu-jin, are you crazy?

304
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,682
Why did you do that?

305
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:46,185
What did I ever do to you?

306
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,561
Why did you do that to me?

307
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:49,104
- Nurse!
- Huh?

308
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:50,772
- This way!

309
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:51,815
- Why?
- Sir!

310
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,275
- Please, sir!
- Let go first.

311
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,194
- Please calm down.
- We can talk it out.

312
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,070
- Calm down!
- Why did you do that?

313
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:57,988
- Stop.
- Let go!

314
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:59,072
Why?

315
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,617
- Are you okay?
- Damn it!

316
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,994
Calm down, sir, or we'll call the police.

317
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:05,662
I'm so sorry.

318
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:07,623
He's not usually like this.

319
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,917
But he's unwell,
so he's not himself right now.

320
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,418
Please forgive him, Doctor.

321
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:13,212
I'm really sorry.

322
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,426
Please lie down.

323
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:20,969
I'm so sorry.

324
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,599
What's wrong with you, Mu-jin?

325
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:27,309
Lie down. Rest.

326
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:36,902
I'll bring you some water.

327
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:39,404
Don't cause another scene.
Just stay still, okay?

328
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:48,163
Damn it!

329
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:51,959
A total nutjob ruining my mood
first thing in the morning.

330
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:05,430
Hey, Gyeon-u.

331
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:10,060
Took you a while to come.
You might as well have shown up tomorrow.

332
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:12,479
Sorry, I was about to head out
when nature called.

333
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:14,773
- Oh, man…
- Seriously.

334
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:16,108
And Mu-jin? Is he okay?

335
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:18,652
You have no idea
what I went through earlier.

336
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:20,779
He completely lost it and went wild.

337
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:22,030
Did you record it?

338
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:24,408
Are you serious?

339
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:27,077
- Where is he?
- Over there.

340
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:36,169
He was here before.

341
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:39,840
- Where did he go?
- Where is he?

342
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:43,969
This is bad. We need to find him.

343
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:44,970
Oh no!

344
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:19,338
Damn it…

345
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:24,509
You crazy bastard! Hey!

346
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:31,933
I'm not letting you off.

347
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,478
I'm reporting you, you nutjob.

348
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:36,938
How dare you assault a doctor?

349
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:39,941
"Hey, newbie."

350
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:41,818
What's he saying?

351
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:43,820
"Are you a doctor?"

352
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,199
"You don't tell me what to do."

353
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:51,078
"Stop acting out and do as you're told."

354
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:58,001
"Are you crying?"

355
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:02,089
"You think you deserve to cry?"

356
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:05,842
You gave the order.

357
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:10,639
I only did what I was told,
so why are you pinning it on me?

358
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:13,558
Why? I'm only a junior nurse!

359
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:16,937
Do you know…

360
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,233
how scared and upset I was?

361
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,401
What the hell?

362
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:26,655
Just to save yourself,

363
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,740
you threw an innocent person
under the bus,

364
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,659
and your job is to save lives?

365
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:34,079
Who are you?

366
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:35,872
A scumbag like you

367
00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:39,918
has no right to wear this white coat!

368
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:45,257
Over there! Stop!

369
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,424
- Big brother!
- Mu-jin!

370
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:47,843
- Get off him!
- Mu-jin!

371
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:48,885
Big brother…

372
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:50,137
What are you doing?

373
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:52,139
Doctor!

374
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:55,684
- What's wrong with you?
- Doctor, are you okay?

375
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,105
I'm so sorry.

376
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:05,110
Get out!

377
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:06,778
Don't push. We're leaving.

378
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:09,906
Sirs, we're on our way out.
Look, we're outside.

379
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:13,118
If you cause another scene,
we're calling the police.

380
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:16,413
Yes, we're sorry. We're really sorry.

381
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:17,998
Mu-jin!

382
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:18,915
Are you crazy?

383
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:21,001
- Why did you do that?
- Yeah, why?

384
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:24,963
Even if you ask me,
I don't know what to say…

385
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:30,135
You're lucky the doctor was nice.
Otherwise, you'd be behind bars right now.

386
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:33,013
You grabbed him by the collar
and even hit him.

387
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:35,056
He's a saint for letting you off.

388
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,350
- I sure wouldn't have.
- Agreed.

389
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:38,435
Well, I…

390
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:41,188
I have no idea what you're talking about.

391
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:43,982
What? Don't act like you don't remember.

392
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:47,485
Big brother, you really don't remember
causing a scene?

393
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:50,614
Or are you pretending?

394
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:55,285
I had no idea you were like this.
You were totally aggressive.

395
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:57,412
I know. He seemed like a different person.

396
00:24:57,495 --> 00:24:59,331
God, I'm so embarrassed.

397
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:00,832
Let's go. Go.

398
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:02,876
What are you doing? Come on.

399
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,338
What did I do to you?

400
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:07,464
Who are you?

401
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:14,179
You're right. I was a different person.

402
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:37,953
The nurse.

403
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:42,916
Her name was Cho Eun-yeong.

404
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:48,672
<i>Stop acting out and do as you're told.</i>

405
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:50,882
<i>You gave the order.</i>

406
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:54,970
I only did what I was told,
so why are you pinning it on me?

407
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:03,812
God, you startled me.

408
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:05,438
Hello, sir.

409
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:18,618
Whatever.

410
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,246
I'm out.

411
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:23,957
Pay me this month's salary,
and let's end things here.

412
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,043
So I'm telling you,

413
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:29,421
Cho Eun-yeong
was a nurse at that hospital,

414
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,673
and she was seriously wronged.

415
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:36,177
I know, and I get it,
but I'm too scared to do this.

416
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:39,347
What if she wants revenge again
and sets the hospital on fire

417
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,641
or tracks down the doctor
with a knife and…

418
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:42,892
What a nightmare.

419
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:46,354
I'm sorry, but I don't have the heart
to see that happen.

420
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:50,984
That's why we need to help her find peace.
Or else, I'll be the one to die.

421
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:52,319
That burning guy in jeans…

422
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:54,154
How will you help her?

423
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:56,406
All you know is her name, Cho Eun-yeong.

424
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:59,075
So how will you resolve her grudge?

425
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:00,410
Excuse me, you two.

426
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:02,662
Please look at this.

427
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:04,706
What is it?

428
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:11,087
"On the 29th,
at a hospital in Jung-gu, Seoul,

429
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:14,090
a nurse jumped from the roof and…

430
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:15,675
died"?

431
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:17,302
What is this?

432
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:20,555
NURSE JUMPS FROM ROOF OF HOSPITAL
IN JUNG-GU, SEOUL

433
00:27:20,638 --> 00:27:23,308
What? Is that it? No other articles?

434
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,897
Anyway, it's a relief, big brother.

435
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,273
What is?

436
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:33,109
We now know
it wasn't the electrocution talking.

437
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:35,028
I kept saying it was the truth!

438
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:38,782
That's what's terrifying me.
What if you suddenly lose it again and…

439
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:40,867
Think about what happened at the hospital.

440
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:44,371
If no one stopped you,
you would've taken the fall for her crime!

441
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:46,247
If I don't do this, I'll die!

442
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:49,042
Are you trying to end up in jail?
You're driving me nuts!

443
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:50,835
I'm the one going nuts here!

444
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:54,172
Hold on, you two!
Please calm yourselves down.

445
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:59,302
Instead of letting our emotions take over,
we must think rationally.

446
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:26,204
Can you see something?

447
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:37,465
Someone's mind is in the gutter.

448
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:39,634
Me? Are you talking about me?

449
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:41,428
You're really gifted.

450
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:49,519
How is our compatibility?

451
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:50,729
What are you doing?

452
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:54,149
A match made in heaven.

453
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:55,608
I knew it.

454
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:57,485
- See?
- Whatever.

455
00:28:58,445 --> 00:28:59,696
Not you.

456
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:01,990
Be good to her.

457
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:06,077
If you lose her,
you won't find another woman in your life.

458
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:08,329
No, that's not what we're here for.

459
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:13,001
Please look into this person behind him.

460
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:24,095
Dear heavens!

461
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:25,805
I thought she was famous.

462
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:27,307
She is.

463
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:29,100
She has a Silver Play Button.

464
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,896
Excuse me, ma'am. Not that.

465
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:35,023
Please get rid of the ghost on this man.

466
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,733
We heard that was your specialty.

467
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:38,026
I wouldn't dare!

468
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:41,154
That is not someone
I could ever go up against.

469
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:42,864
What?

470
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:46,242
I mean, a great general is with you.

471
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:50,455
A general? Isn't it a woman?

472
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:56,294
Your destiny is full of fire,

473
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:59,297
but the one bit of water energy you had
has also burned out!

474
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,800
You were destined to die

475
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:05,053
but survived with the help
of the one you serve,

476
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:06,513
so do as you're told.

477
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:08,181
Do not slack off.

478
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:13,770
That… jeans guy is the one I serve?

479
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:18,775
Excuse me…

480
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:21,986
Could you tell me more
about our compatibility…

481
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:24,656
Compatibility is the least
of your worries.

482
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:27,075
You have humiliation in your fate,
so watch this.

483
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:29,410
I told you to watch your mouth.

484
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:31,120
Let's go.

485
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:33,665
Wait.

486
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:36,042
The general will protect you,

487
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:39,796
but your eyes are hollow
and your mind is weak.

488
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:41,923
The perfect target for a vengeful spirit.

489
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:47,178
Yielding your body without caution
could bring you disaster.

490
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:52,141
That woman is full of spite.

491
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:54,853
Then what should we do?

492
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,941
Luck is on your side.

493
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:10,034
TALISMANS 50% OFF

494
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:14,330
I can't with you, seriously.

495
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,833
Fifty percent off isn't bad.

496
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:18,209
Then buy one.

497
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:20,920
How much is it?

498
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:22,714
Go ask outside.

499
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,549
Go ahead.

500
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:26,175
Hey, you do it.

501
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:29,846
You've committed the most sins,
especially with your mind in the gutter.

502
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:31,514
How could I commit the most sins?

503
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:33,349
Mu-jin's lived longer than me.

504
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:36,436
I haven't committed a lot of sins, but…

505
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:38,897
Someone has entered my body.

506
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:39,814
And…

507
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:43,568
- What?
- Did he leave?

508
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:49,115
Excuse me, Father.

509
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:56,122
I've never had three people
enter the confessional together

510
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:58,458
in my 30 years as a priest.

511
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:02,420
You must observe the proper etiquette.

512
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:04,631
We apologize.

513
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:06,507
We're sorry.

514
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:09,093
We're very sorry.

515
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:11,346
But we heard you're skilled at exorcisms.

516
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:13,306
He's in a dire state.

517
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:14,474
Yes, me.

518
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:17,602
Exorcism?

519
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,358
I don't do stuff like that.

520
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:27,695
Then, could you at least
refer us to another exorcist…

521
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:31,074
Or perhaps sprinkle him
with some holy water…

522
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:39,165
This is no place to be messing around.

523
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:48,466
- Who told you about him?
- My subscriber told me.

524
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:49,467
For God's sake!

525
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:52,053
Let's go.

526
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:58,559
Please, drink up.

527
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:07,151
Venerable,

528
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:10,196
please show us the way.

529
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:13,241
You came to the right place.

530
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:17,954
I will show you the way.

531
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:19,080
Thank you.

532
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:31,426
- Is someone counting?
- We're at 537.

533
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:57,827
Count.

534
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,162
It's 3,227.

535
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:04,083
You must get up, big brother.

536
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:06,335
Help.

537
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:09,464
You need to do this.

538
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:11,049
Just a bit more.

539
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:18,639
Big brother!

540
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:20,600
Big brother!

541
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:23,186
Mu-jin!

542
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:28,524
Gyeon-u, there are stairs.

543
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:31,027
I'll help you.

544
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:35,740
Hold on. Wait for us.

545
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:37,492
Wait up. Aren't you tired?

546
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:40,328
Do 108 bows 108 times?

547
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,413
What complete nonsense.

548
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:46,209
Why did we do it as well?

549
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:49,879
Exactly. Why did we do that?

550
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:54,258
Big brother, don't forget your protection.

551
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:57,095
- You bought it?
- Of course.

552
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,180
It was on sale.

553
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:03,017
Wait, Mu-jin.

554
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,436
Didn't you see anything
while you were possessed?

555
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,105
I don't remember anything.

556
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:09,023
Then did she say anything to you?

557
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,025
No, she did that without saying a thing.

558
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:14,987
This is so annoying.
It's completely different from last time.

559
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:16,697
I mean…

560
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:21,202
I need to know what happened
to resolve her grudge.

561
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:24,914
This is really frustrating.

562
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:27,458
If you happen to see her again,

563
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:29,836
you can't let her
take over your body again!

564
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:32,380
You heard it. She's full of spite. Okay?

565
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:33,965
Yeah…

566
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,719
My whole body's aching.

567
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:39,637
Me too.

568
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:42,014
I need to sleep.

569
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:44,684
Drive safe.

570
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:46,310
Hui-joo?

571
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:48,271
Drive safe.

572
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:51,899
Big brother?

573
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:52,900
I'm exhausted.

574
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:55,903
I shouldn't sleep, right?

575
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,113
- No.
- Of course not.

576
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:25,892
- Get home safe.
- Call me if anything happens.

577
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:27,351
Actually…

578
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:30,229
You know that feeling
when something bad might happen?

579
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:32,023
That eerie feeling.

580
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:33,566
That's when you need to call!

581
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:35,693
Yes, big brother. I'll come right away.

582
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:36,777
Why would you come?

583
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:38,529
I don't feel good about this.

584
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:40,448
He might get into trouble again

585
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:43,784
and call me, saying,
"Hui-joo, I'm at the police station."

586
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,829
This won't do. You sleep with him today.

587
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:49,040
- I'm picky about where I sleep.
- Seriously?

588
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:54,545
Should we just tie you to the bed
so you can't wander around?

589
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,047
Let's do that. Get ready.

590
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:59,800
Stop talking nonsense and go home!

591
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:03,971
I'll be fine.

592
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,557
My legs feel like jelly,
so I can't even go anywhere.

593
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:10,228
See you tomorrow. Go.

594
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:13,689
- Lock the door, okay?
- Okay.

595
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:16,150
- And charge your phone.
- I'm not a kid!

596
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,778
You seem like one. I'm worried.
You're so much work.

597
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:21,530
- Let's go.
- We'll be going.

598
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:22,448
Go!

599
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:23,491
We will!

600
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:25,326
Bye-bye.

601
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:28,329
Oh, man…

602
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:36,212
You need to buy something to sit there.

603
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,547
Or the boss will tell me off.

604
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:40,424
Oh, sorry.

605
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:44,887
I will be buying something,
but my legs gave way…

606
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:50,059
I should get an energy drink.

607
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,395
I overworked myself today.

608
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:55,481
Lend me a hand?

609
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,365
You do look worn out.

610
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:06,075
No, I'm fine.

611
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:06,993
Is it okay…

612
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:10,162
being a labor attorney?

613
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:13,040
Why do you ask?

614
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,209
Just curious.

615
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:17,378
Being a labor attorney…

616
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,089
A labor attorney…

617
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:22,466
Well, I don't know.

618
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:25,970
I got into it because I heard
you make good money,

619
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:28,764
but the people
who come to a labor attorney

620
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:30,599
aren't doing so

621
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:34,103
for pleasant or happy reasons.

622
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:38,899
It feels like a piece of me
is being worn down day by day.

623
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:44,238
Why? Want to become one?

624
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:45,656
Oh, no, I don't.

625
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:48,075
What was that then?

626
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:56,042
Yes, sir.

627
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:58,377
<i>Yun-jae! Why aren't you at the register?</i>

628
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:02,006
I was cleaning up outside.

629
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:03,841
Yes, I'm going back in now.

630
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:17,623
I'm too tired to be startled.

631
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:23,254
First…

632
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:25,756
Let me hear you out.

633
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:29,385
I need to know what happened to help…

634
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:32,763
No, please! Don't come any closer.
Just say it from there!

635
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:34,640
Ms. Cho, if you keep doing this,

636
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:37,977
I can't help you
with your revenge or your grudge!

637
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:50,614
Yes, you made the right call.

638
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:54,910
You said you need to know
what happened to help her.

639
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:05,129
<i>Use your head, will you?</i>

640
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:12,386
I'm busy enough as it is
without having to babysit you.

641
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:15,890
Did you check
on the DM patient's transfer?

642
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:19,310
I asked you to follow up
on whether the consult was made.

643
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:21,270
Hey.

644
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:25,566
Yesterday you ignored a set of abnormal
vitals and nearly called a rapid.

645
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:28,110
- Get your act together.
- Come on, Nurse Lee.

646
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:30,321
She's worked overtime
for the past few days.

647
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:32,448
Eun-yeong's been on call this whole week.

648
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:36,368
Screw over the next shift nurse again,
and I won't let it slide.

649
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:39,747
Come on, Nurse Lee.
You must be really tired today.

650
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:43,375
Why did an idiot like her
apply to work in IM?

651
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:49,048
Your blood pressure's
a little high, ma'am.

652
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:50,591
Hold on.

653
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:52,968
Did you just call me "ma'am"?

654
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:56,972
Why would I be "ma'am" to you?

655
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:01,519
I'm sorry.

656
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:07,066
Seriously, I'm not even married,
and I get called that everywhere!

657
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:10,152
No wonder my blood pressure's so high.

658
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:13,155
I apologize. I'll be careful next time.

659
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:18,202
Yes?

660
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:21,038
Yes, understood.

661
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:32,216
BABE, DID YOU HAVE TO SKIP
LUNCH AGAIN TODAY?

662
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:40,766
Nurse Cho. Did you prep the antibiotics
for the patients for 4:00 p.m.?

663
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,657
It's almost time for the rounds.

664
00:42:57,324 --> 00:42:58,576
Why are you so slow?

665
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,121
I told you to prep them
ahead of time, didn't I?

666
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:04,790
I came 30 minutes early to do them…

667
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:10,796
If 30 minutes isn't enough,
you should come earlier.

668
00:43:10,879 --> 00:43:12,631
Isn't that right?

669
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:15,843
Yes, Nurse Lee.

670
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:29,607
It never ends with you, does it?

671
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:32,234
Do you know how expensive…

672
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:38,198
Why did someone like her end up here?

673
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:41,410
Instead of doing work,
she gives us more work to do.

674
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:45,080
Seriously, I swear,
she will be the death of me.

675
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:55,674
Are you okay?

676
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:57,843
Yes.

677
00:43:57,926 --> 00:44:01,847
Try to understand. She's been working
overtime a lot, so she's a little on edge.

678
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:10,981
You know A-reum's pregnant, right?

679
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:15,110
The truth is,

680
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:18,822
Seo-jeong had a miscarriage last year
and she was trying again recently,

681
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:23,827
but the nurse manager said
she couldn't this year because of A-reum.

682
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:26,163
That's why she's so on edge.

683
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:30,959
They say no one's having kids
in this country,

684
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:34,004
but we're made to feel guilty
for getting pregnant here.

685
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:36,215
Watch your hands.

686
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:43,222
I have to walk the dog this late at night.

687
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:44,932
Mi-joo's really driving me crazy.

688
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:47,476
She doesn't care about me at all.

689
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:49,269
I thought she was paying you.

690
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,399
At least we get to go for a walk too.

691
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:55,317
That has no merit for me.

692
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,654
Anyway, will Mu-jin be okay?

693
00:44:58,737 --> 00:45:00,823
Don't worry. He'll be fine.

694
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:04,493
It must be nice being so carefree.
I'm worried sick.

695
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:06,328
It must be nice being him.

696
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:08,956
You worry about him so much. I envy him.

697
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:10,999
Are you seriously saying that right now?

698
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:13,710
Let's call him to see what he's doing.

699
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:19,716
<i>The person you are calling</i>
<i>is not available. Please leave a…</i>

700
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,635
Why isn't he picking up?

701
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:24,012
He's not getting into trouble, is he?

702
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:26,890
If you're so worried,
we can see for ourselves.

703
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:27,850
How?

704
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:42,364
Wow, no way.

705
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:45,909
- Why didn't I think of this?
- Because you only think about me?

706
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:49,788
Let's turn to the right.

707
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:56,712
- There!
- There he is.

708
00:45:57,379 --> 00:45:59,882
He must've been tired.
He's already asleep.

709
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:01,300
I know.

710
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:03,302
I feel better seeing this.

711
00:46:03,385 --> 00:46:05,345
I told you. You don't need to worry.

712
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:07,806
Ppokku, what's wrong?
Wait, where are you going?

713
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:11,518
Enough…

714
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:16,398
Stop!

715
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:20,986
Fine.

716
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:25,532
I get it! So let me go already!

717
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:27,743
You get it? Already?

718
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:29,536
Get what?

719
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:30,454
What else?

720
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:33,832
I completely get
what Ms. Cho Eun-yeong went through.

721
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:36,627
- Completely?
- Yes, completely!

722
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:40,547
I get why she made that decision.

723
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:44,134
They were really hard on a junior nurse.

724
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:52,809
That's not all.

725
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:53,852
Then…

726
00:46:54,811 --> 00:46:56,063
what else is there?

727
00:46:57,523 --> 00:46:58,899
- Curious?
- No.

728
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:00,901
- Yes, I'm sure you're curious.
- I'm not.

729
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:03,737
You need to see it well
to help her properly.

730
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:12,329
Can't you just explain it to me?

731
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:14,498
Of course not.

732
00:47:14,581 --> 00:47:17,626
You won't understand her feelings
unless you've lived it.

733
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:26,385
We don't have any rooms right now.

734
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:30,222
If you give us some time,
we'll move you to another room.

735
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:34,560
He says his back really hurts.

736
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:36,061
Can he lie on his side?

737
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:40,399
Right now, it'll feel uncomfortable
no matter how he lies.

738
00:47:40,482 --> 00:47:42,067
Still, can't you do anything?

739
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:44,319
He says it's too uncomfortable.

740
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:47,739
Please help change positions.

741
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:49,491
Yes, Doctor.

742
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:50,701
Thank you, Doctor.

743
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:52,869
Well then, I'll be off.

744
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:54,788
I'll help you change positions.

745
00:47:54,871 --> 00:47:56,582
I'm pulling back the blanket.

746
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:09,344
Nurse Cho.

747
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:11,221
Yes?

748
00:48:13,473 --> 00:48:15,851
That patient you repositioned earlier.

749
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:16,977
Yes.

750
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:19,438
Give him two amps of KCl IV.

751
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:22,733
- His levels are still quite low.
- Sorry?

752
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:29,156
Just wondering,
but have you seen the lab results?

753
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:33,535
His levels came back to normal,
so I don't think he needs any more KCl…

754
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:37,748
Hey, newbie.

755
00:48:38,832 --> 00:48:39,666
Yes, Doctor.

756
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,251
Are you a doctor?

757
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:43,962
You don't tell me what to do.

758
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:46,131
I apologize.

759
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:56,224
Stop acting out and do as you're told.

760
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:01,563
Yes, Doctor. I'll carry it out
per your verbal order.

761
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:08,987
<i>I've been doing overtime all week.</i>

762
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:12,449
I'm seriously about to die right now.

763
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:14,785
Have you talked
to the grievance committee?

764
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:16,953
Oh, that?

765
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:20,916
I filed a report,
but they told me to just wait.

766
00:49:26,505 --> 00:49:27,339
Si-yeon.

767
00:49:28,882 --> 00:49:30,300
I really want to quit.

768
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:33,595
But…

769
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:38,475
If you quit before hitting a year,
it won't count on your resume.

770
00:49:38,558 --> 00:49:40,018
It'll be hard to go elsewhere.

771
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:45,941
You said your parents were so happy
when you got this job.

772
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,779
It'd be a waste to leave like this.

773
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:53,782
Seriously.

774
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:57,035
We all make mistakes, don't we?
They're being so harsh.

775
00:49:58,078 --> 00:50:01,039
No one's perfect from the start.
Isn't that right?

776
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:06,503
Eun-yeong.

777
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:11,341
Don't cry. It's okay.

778
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:12,759
Don't cry.

779
00:50:14,594 --> 00:50:16,138
I need to talk to you.

780
00:50:22,018 --> 00:50:23,145
Unbelievable.

781
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:26,815
I gave you a hard time?

782
00:50:28,316 --> 00:50:30,235
You're the one who gave me a hard time!

783
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:33,780
You've been here for months
but can't do your job properly.

784
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:36,199
Are you the only one going without sleep?

785
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:38,744
What about the people
suffering because of you?

786
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:45,292
Will you report this too?

787
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,877
WORKPLACE BULLYING REPORT

788
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:51,798
Am I verbally abusing you right now?

789
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:55,343
Is this abuse of authority?

790
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:57,220
Huh?

791
00:51:04,686 --> 00:51:08,982
<i>Unit 81, Room 810, Bed 1.</i>

792
00:51:10,275 --> 00:51:11,777
Come on! Get it together!

793
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:19,534
Hye-jin, get a line in first.

794
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:20,660
Right.

795
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:23,830
The current time is 18:51 hours.

796
00:51:26,124 --> 00:51:27,584
Si-yeon, bring the bicarb.

797
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:30,670
What's happening to my husband?

798
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:32,130
What's going on?

799
00:51:41,014 --> 00:51:44,309
<i>Do you save lives at this hospital</i>
<i>or end them?</i>

800
00:51:45,101 --> 00:51:46,478
It's you, isn't it?

801
00:51:47,687 --> 00:51:50,607
After you came and left,
my husband ended up like that!

802
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:52,442
- Ma'am, please.
- Huh?

803
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:57,364
If anything happens to him,
I'll make you pay! This is malpractice!

804
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:59,074
Please, just one moment.

805
00:52:00,408 --> 00:52:01,827
I'm truly sorry, ma'am.

806
00:52:03,411 --> 00:52:07,123
The mistake was made by our nurse,
so I sincerely apologize on her behalf.

807
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:10,460
What? I only did what you ordered…

808
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:13,088
What on earth are you saying right now?

809
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:15,715
We're sorry.

810
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:19,010
Apologize, now!

811
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:24,516
I'm sorry.

812
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:30,021
I'm going to sue every single one of you!

813
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:33,066
You'd better save my husband!

814
00:52:33,149 --> 00:52:34,609
Please come help.

815
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:35,610
Save him right now!

816
00:52:35,694 --> 00:52:37,612
Come with me, ma'am.

817
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:50,542
Hey, newbie!

818
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:56,965
Didn't I tell you to handle it right?

819
00:52:57,591 --> 00:52:58,508
What did I…

820
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:00,135
"What did I"?

821
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:01,761
Are you crying?

822
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:04,764
You think you deserve to cry?

823
00:53:05,473 --> 00:53:07,684
Don't you see the mess you've caused?

824
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:11,897
I'll tell her off, Doctor.
You must be busy.

825
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:15,650
This happened
because you didn't train her properly.

826
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:17,652
Do you call that doing your job?

827
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:20,947
Even her preceptor is a mess.

828
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:37,380
Draft a written apology first.

829
00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:39,925
Nurse Lee, it wasn't me.

830
00:53:40,008 --> 00:53:43,136
I just did what I was told.
This isn't my fault.

831
00:53:43,219 --> 00:53:46,681
It's not your fault? He flatlined
and ended up in the ICU because of you!

832
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:52,270
Also,

833
00:53:53,146 --> 00:53:55,774
how dare you talk back
in front of the patient's family?

834
00:53:56,524 --> 00:53:58,526
You should've been
begging for forgiveness.

835
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:02,322
If you're dumb, at least read the room.

836
00:54:04,157 --> 00:54:04,991
Nurse Lee…

837
00:54:06,701 --> 00:54:09,996
Please look at this.
It's written right here.

838
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:11,748
I…

839
00:54:11,831 --> 00:54:12,874
Eun-yeong.

840
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:18,672
No matter how much you deny it,

841
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:21,549
people will believe the doctor

842
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:24,260
over a junior nurse.

843
00:54:26,179 --> 00:54:28,390
Let's not complicate things.

844
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:44,447
Keep it together

845
00:54:45,907 --> 00:54:47,534
and make it clear who's to blame.

846
00:54:49,285 --> 00:54:50,912
You're a third-year resident now.

847
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:54,249
It won't be good if you get sued.

848
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:59,629
You put yourself through med school,
so you can't let this ruin your career.

849
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:02,215
No, of course not.

850
00:55:02,298 --> 00:55:05,760
Did you take care
of the order sheet and the chart?

851
00:55:05,844 --> 00:55:06,845
Yes, sir.

852
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:12,726
If this goes wrong,
it won't just fall on you.

853
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:14,728
The hospital will go down too.

854
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:17,022
If rumor gets out
there was a medical mistake,

855
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:18,898
it'll hurt our hospital's reputation,

856
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:21,443
and it'll hang over your career for life.

857
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:24,029
So stay sharp.

858
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:26,573
Yes, sir.

859
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:42,130
<i>Hey, newbie!</i>

860
00:55:42,213 --> 00:55:44,215
<i>Don't you see the mess you've caused?</i>

861
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:48,053
<i>Stop acting out and do as you're told.</i>

862
00:55:49,262 --> 00:55:50,972
<i>It never ends with you, does it?</i>

863
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:53,475
<i>Why did someone like her end up here?</i>

864
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:03,985
<i>Didn't you know?</i>

865
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:08,490
<i>It says in your contract you can't resign</i>
<i>or join another hospital for a year.</i>

866
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:15,872
<i>I'm going to sue you for negligence!</i>

867
00:56:15,955 --> 00:56:19,250
<i>And I'll be filing a civil claim</i>
<i>for damages too!</i>

868
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:44,752
Seriously, why?

869
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:47,255
Why are you doing this to me?

870
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:56,181
You said you wanted to know
what happened to Eun-yeong.

871
00:57:57,223 --> 00:57:58,892
Not like this, I didn't!

872
00:58:03,188 --> 00:58:05,815
Helping them find peace was the deal.

873
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:09,944
If you keep taking over my body,
what do you expect me to do?

874
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:11,821
Did you plan to do anything at all?

875
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:14,449
A <i>goot</i> ritual, maybe?

876
00:58:16,242 --> 00:58:18,745
No, that was…

877
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:22,874
If I'm going to try anything at all,
Eun-yeong needs to let me go.

878
00:58:22,957 --> 00:58:26,586
Fine, try what you can.
I'll keep her with me.

879
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:28,796
What? Really?

880
00:58:30,965 --> 00:58:32,175
Yes.

881
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:35,011
I'm not getting possessed again, am I?

882
00:58:35,094 --> 00:58:37,680
Anything but that.

883
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:38,890
Don't you trust me?

884
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:44,854
How do you expect me to trust you?

885
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:48,233
You're too suspicious for your own good.

886
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:54,489
Anyway, since you're here,
let me ask you a question.

887
00:58:55,448 --> 00:58:56,866
How am I supposed to do this?

888
00:58:56,950 --> 00:59:00,245
You didn't give me any instructions.
Isn't that a bit harsh?

889
00:59:00,328 --> 00:59:02,205
That's for you to figure out.

890
00:59:02,288 --> 00:59:03,706
You're the labor attorney.

891
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:06,000
In my view,

892
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:09,462
you seem well-suited
for this kind of work.

893
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:11,297
"Well-suited"?

894
00:59:14,133 --> 00:59:15,385
Did you say "well-suited"?

895
00:59:15,468 --> 00:59:18,638
My, you get angry over a compliment.

896
00:59:27,438 --> 00:59:29,941
Didn't that shaman tell you
to listen to me?

897
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:35,071
Yes, well…

898
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:39,993
Please tell me. What should I do?

899
00:59:40,952 --> 00:59:43,288
All right. You want to know?

900
00:59:44,497 --> 00:59:45,707
Yes, I want to know.

901
00:59:47,458 --> 00:59:48,293
Come closer.

902
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:53,548
I said, come here.

903
01:00:01,222 --> 01:00:02,432
Essentially…

904
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:07,437
It's…

905
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:37,342
Hold on. Wait for us.

906
01:00:37,425 --> 01:00:38,968
Wait up. Aren't you tired?

907
01:00:40,094 --> 01:00:42,138
Do 108 bows 108 times?

908
01:00:42,221 --> 01:00:43,973
What complete nonsense.

909
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:47,894
Why did we do it as well?

910
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:51,522
Homage to Amitabha Buddha
and Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva.

911
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:10,041
Okay.

912
01:01:13,544 --> 01:01:14,504
Good morning.

913
01:01:14,587 --> 01:01:15,880
Good morning, big brother.

914
01:01:16,714 --> 01:01:18,966
What is all this? Did you buy more?

915
01:01:19,801 --> 01:01:21,052
They were 30% off.

916
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:23,721
How many times must I tell you?

917
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:26,224
- It's no use.
- You're not meant to take that off.

918
01:01:26,307 --> 01:01:29,310
- You'd better get rid of them, got it?
- This is wood energy…

919
01:01:29,394 --> 01:01:30,395
It's wood energy…

920
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:32,188
Hui-joo?

921
01:01:32,897 --> 01:01:34,899
What's this? You've never prayed before.

922
01:01:37,568 --> 01:01:38,403
Amen.

923
01:01:38,486 --> 01:01:41,823
God, seriously, you're both so hopeless.

924
01:01:41,906 --> 01:01:44,659
How can I get anything done with you two?

925
01:01:44,742 --> 01:01:46,828
They have no faith whatsoever.

926
01:01:46,911 --> 01:01:49,914
Shame on you. Get rid of these!

927
01:01:51,666 --> 01:01:55,044
Now, let's see
what the weather's like today.

928
01:01:56,421 --> 01:01:58,715
It's getting hot already.

929
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:01,134
Gosh.

930
01:02:02,635 --> 01:02:04,721
The rainy season's early this year.

931
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:07,640
Honestly…

932
01:02:10,184 --> 01:02:11,102
Lord!

933
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:42,425
<i>If we want to draw media attention,</i>
<i>we should dig around there first.</i>

934
01:02:42,508 --> 01:02:43,676
Why, seriously, why?

935
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,762
<i>Why are they digging into that again?</i>

936
01:02:45,845 --> 01:02:48,598
Do whatever it takes
to keep this from escalating.

937
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:50,558
That paper slid in there.

938
01:02:50,641 --> 01:02:52,602
<i>It could be the key evidence.</i>

939
01:02:52,685 --> 01:02:54,103
- Where is it?
- Oh my God.

940
01:02:54,187 --> 01:02:58,024
<i>- Switch on. I'm off to do my rounds.</i>
<i>- Will people fall for this white coat?</i>

941
01:02:58,107 --> 01:02:59,358
- Handsome guy!
- Thank you.

942
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:01,736
- Are you yourself?
- What are you doing?

943
01:03:01,819 --> 01:03:02,945
Not here for revenge?

944
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:04,864
<i>- Act natural and run!</i>
- Hey!

945
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:06,240
- Seriously!
- No!

946
01:03:06,324 --> 01:03:07,492
Don't, Nurse Lee.

947
01:03:08,951 --> 01:03:10,077
<i>You can't let go.</i>

948
01:03:11,037 --> 01:03:12,830
- Cho Eun-yeong?
<i>- Hold tight!</i>

949
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:17,710
