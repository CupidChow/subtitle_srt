Deok Hui.

10
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:36,916
Gosh.

11
00:00:38,378 --> 00:00:40,389
Deok Hui.

12
00:00:44,635 --> 00:00:46,226
Come on.

13
00:00:46,226 --> 00:00:48,397
Are you pooping?

14
00:00:57,316 --> 00:01:00,600
Why did she leave without telling me?

15
00:01:01,611 --> 00:01:05,024
The truth about Eun Woo behind his angelic face

16
00:01:10,029 --> 00:01:11,491
Share

17
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:24,614
Deok Hui, why did you just leave yesterday?

18
00:01:24,614 --> 00:01:27,758
Do you want to come over later? I have something to tell you.

19
00:01:27,758 --> 00:01:31,300
No, I'm busy today.

20
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,624
What's wrong? Are you sick?

21
00:01:34,624 --> 00:01:36,976
I'm going to nap. Don't talk to me.

22
00:01:36,976 --> 00:01:39,610
Deok Hui, I've got the ticket.

23
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:41,371
Really?

24
00:01:42,442 --> 00:01:45,616
I failed at getting mine. Can you sell it to me?

25
00:01:45,616 --> 00:01:47,566
Twice... No, I'll give you three times the amount.

26
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:50,369
No way. My fingers almost bled trying to get these.

27
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:53,333
Please, my friend. Let's talk about this.

28
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:57,587
Oh my gosh. The thing about Eun Woo must be real. There's a video this time.

29
00:02:00,631 --> 00:02:02,071
"The truth about Eun Woo."

30
00:02:02,071 --> 00:02:03,923
"A video of another victim?"

31
00:02:03,923 --> 00:02:05,825
"Eun Woo habitually molested minors

32
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:08,407
even before his debut"?

33
00:02:08,407 --> 00:02:12,011
I went out simply as a fan,

34
00:02:12,011 --> 00:02:14,653
but he kept telling me to get in his car.

35
00:02:14,653 --> 00:02:17,497
He took her to a studio apartment...

36
00:02:17,497 --> 00:02:19,148
I can't believe this.

37
00:02:19,148 --> 00:02:20,960
Isn't Cha Eun Woo the kindest-looking one?

38
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,652
He was totally wearing a mask.

39
00:02:22,652 --> 00:02:25,274
Guys like him always turn out to be the worst.

40
00:02:25,274 --> 00:02:27,276
He is totally a habitual criminal.

41
00:02:27,276 --> 00:02:30,440
You don't know anything. Don't talk of him like that without a thought.

42
00:02:34,745 --> 00:02:36,865
Is she a fan too?

43
00:02:39,669 --> 00:02:41,672
This isn't good.

44
00:02:41,672 --> 00:02:44,933
I need to at least tell Deok Hui about everything.

45
00:02:46,425 --> 00:02:50,830
Eun Woo

46
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:54,014
The phone is turned off. You'll be connected to voice mail.

47
00:02:54,014 --> 00:02:56,826
An additional fee will be charged after the beep.

48
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:01,640
What do we do?

49
00:03:02,601 --> 00:03:05,084
What's going to happen to him?

50
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:10,519
I'm coming in.

51
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:20,870
Eun Woo's phone won't work for the time being.

52
00:03:21,792 --> 00:03:24,433
He told me to tell you not to worry about him.

53
00:03:25,715 --> 00:03:28,177
I think he knows what he's doing.

54
00:03:28,177 --> 00:03:30,469
Let's wait and see.

55
00:03:47,987 --> 00:03:49,529
Deok Hui, why did you leave without me?

56
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:51,240
Deok Hui, are you still busy?

57
00:03:57,828 --> 00:03:59,439
Will you be the Revenge Goddess?

58
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,041
Enter target's name

59
00:04:07,337 --> 00:04:11,079
If I knew who it was, I could at least try to do something.

60
00:04:12,381 --> 00:04:15,565
I want to at least tell Deok Hui about everything.

61
00:04:31,901 --> 00:04:34,033
Showtime K-Pop

62
00:04:36,365 --> 00:04:38,678
Manager, may I have a moment?

63
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:43,442
Producer, have we checked on the smoke?

64
00:04:43,442 --> 00:04:46,545
The cue sheet suddenly changed,

65
00:04:46,545 --> 00:04:49,098
so their performance got canceled today. I'm sorry.

66
00:04:49,098 --> 00:04:50,841
How could that happen?

67
00:04:50,841 --> 00:04:54,494
The fans are already here, and the damage won't be small either.

68
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:56,496
The decision was made higher up.

69
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:58,769
There's nothing I can do about it.

70
00:04:58,769 --> 00:05:00,690
Wait a minute. Producer.

71
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:02,560
Producer.

72
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:06,736
I wonder if we'll even be able to have our concert.

73
00:05:06,736 --> 00:05:09,509
Hyeong, what is this?

74
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:11,862
You should at least give an explanation or take the blame.

75
00:05:11,862 --> 00:05:13,422
Do something!

76
00:05:13,422 --> 00:05:15,975
Hey, let's not do this.

77
00:05:15,975 --> 00:05:18,657
It's under investigation. We decided to wait it out.

78
00:05:18,657 --> 00:05:21,170
I'm just frustrated.

79
00:05:40,349 --> 00:05:42,121
Ah Reum, do you have an umbrella?

80
00:05:42,121 --> 00:05:43,252
No.

81
00:05:43,252 --> 00:05:44,795
Do you want to share mine?

82
00:05:44,795 --> 00:05:46,355
We're going opposite ways though.

83
00:05:46,355 --> 00:05:48,819
It's all right. It doesn't matter.

84
00:05:48,819 --> 00:05:50,559
Let's go.

85
00:06:03,242 --> 00:06:04,923
What do you think?

86
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:09,347
You got here thanks to me.

87
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:24,634
I'll get going.

88
00:07:33,373 --> 00:07:35,234
I'm back.

89
00:07:35,234 --> 00:07:37,527
Yes.

90
00:07:37,527 --> 00:07:39,448
Clean your room.

91
00:07:39,448 --> 00:07:41,411
Is your room a pigpen or something?

92
00:07:41,411 --> 00:07:43,133
Give me a break.

93
00:07:43,133 --> 00:07:45,494
I don't even have time to clean these days.

94
00:07:45,494 --> 00:07:47,596
Take this.

95
00:07:47,596 --> 00:07:50,379
Why did you take this out? Put it back.

96
00:07:50,379 --> 00:07:51,961
What?

97
00:07:51,961 --> 00:07:54,283
- Why is this here?
- I gave that

98
00:07:54,283 --> 00:07:57,176
to your friend to look at when she was here.

99
00:08:12,371 --> 00:08:16,004
Orabeoni Gu Jun was so cute when he was little.

100
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:19,508
Gu Hui was quite adorable too.

101
00:08:19,508 --> 00:08:22,371
She became uglier as she grew up.

102
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:37,046
What...

103
00:08:37,046 --> 00:08:39,258
What is this?

104
00:08:48,827 --> 00:08:52,191
Gu Hui, what is this?

105
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,011
What?

106
00:09:02,011 --> 00:09:03,802
What is it this time?

107
00:09:05,255 --> 00:09:08,867
- What?
- Why did you show this to her? Why?

108
00:09:08,867 --> 00:09:10,309
- Hey!
- Why?

109
00:09:10,309 --> 00:09:13,543
You're no help to my life, you jerk.

110
00:09:13,543 --> 00:09:16,335
I was going to tell Deok Hui everything.

111
00:09:16,335 --> 00:09:20,429
How can I face her now?

112
00:09:20,429 --> 00:09:23,311
I couldn't think that far.

113
00:09:27,946 --> 00:09:29,738
Oh my gosh.

114
00:09:33,122 --> 00:09:35,774
Who is it? Did you order something?

115
00:09:35,774 --> 00:09:39,127
- No, I didn't.
- You didn't? What is it?

116
00:09:40,999 --> 00:09:43,131
Who is it?

117
00:09:45,094 --> 00:09:47,046
Why isn't anybody here?

118
00:09:49,048 --> 00:09:50,788
What is this?

119
00:09:54,103 --> 00:09:56,086
Did you order this?

120
00:09:56,086 --> 00:09:59,048
What is it? I didn't order anything.

121
00:09:59,048 --> 00:10:01,691
Really? Maybe Gu Hui left it outside.

122
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:04,702
I think I saw a letter inside. Look at it.

123
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:10,989
To Deok Hui

124
00:10:10,989 --> 00:10:14,512
Does she think this will make me feel better?

125
00:10:23,502 --> 00:10:26,966
Astro.

126
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:31,430
Merry Christmas, Deok Hui! Have a wonderful Cristmas!

127
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,223
Deok Hui, good luck on your exam.

128
00:10:35,394 --> 00:10:37,766
Study hard, Deok Hui!

129
00:10:40,809 --> 00:10:43,853
Happy birthday, Deok Hui!

130
00:10:55,704 --> 00:10:59,328
I got these signed cards in advance to give them to you

131
00:10:59,328 --> 00:11:01,651
on special occasions.

132
00:11:02,581 --> 00:11:06,015
He was my oppa's close friend since we were young.

133
00:11:06,015 --> 00:11:08,577
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you earlier.

134
00:11:09,629 --> 00:11:12,532
Because of his situation, everyone kept quiet,

135
00:11:12,532 --> 00:11:14,973
so I couldn't say anything either.

136
00:11:16,015 --> 00:11:20,339
But as I got close to you day by day,

137
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:24,332
I felt like I was doing you wrong, and it was distressing.

138
00:11:26,276 --> 00:11:28,578
I was going to tell you that day,

139
00:11:28,578 --> 00:11:32,932
but you happened to see the photos first.

140
00:11:34,072 --> 00:11:36,155
Meeting you

141
00:11:36,155 --> 00:11:37,837
was the best thing

142
00:11:37,837 --> 00:11:41,440
in my life since entering high school.

143
00:11:42,871 --> 00:11:44,213
Deok Hui,

144
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:47,085
please, forgive me.

145
00:12:05,234 --> 00:12:06,566
Hello.

146
00:12:06,566 --> 00:12:07,967
Oh.

147
00:12:07,967 --> 00:12:10,359
Deok Hui, what are you doing? Why aren't you going inside?

148
00:12:10,359 --> 00:12:12,030
Well,

149
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:14,694
I don't feel quite ready yet.

150
00:12:14,694 --> 00:12:17,246
Why do you need to get ready for eating chicken?

151
00:12:17,246 --> 00:12:18,907
- It's—
- Let's go in.

152
00:12:18,907 --> 00:12:20,789
- Come on.
- All right.

153
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,313
What's wrong with them?

154
00:12:26,085 --> 00:12:27,916
Maybe they got in a fight.

155
00:12:29,378 --> 00:12:32,201
I'm not completely over it yet, you crook.

156
00:12:32,201 --> 00:12:36,254
Thanks for coming anyway. I'm so glad.

157
00:12:39,808 --> 00:12:42,760
Eun Woo Set is always delicious.

158
00:12:44,604 --> 00:12:47,996
Eat as much as you want. For you, it's free forever.

159
00:12:49,108 --> 00:12:51,880
Really? You better keep that promise.

160
00:12:54,113 --> 00:12:58,425
Deok Hui, thank you.

161
00:12:58,847 --> 00:13:00,949
My gosh.

162
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,482
- What's up with them?
- You're the best.

163
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:05,984
Are you all right?

164
00:13:05,984 --> 00:13:08,016
Come here.

165
00:13:08,016 --> 00:13:10,068
It's seriously free for you forever.

166
00:13:10,068 --> 00:13:11,881
Thanks.

167
00:13:12,882 --> 00:13:15,994
First of all, we need to help Eun Woo.

168
00:13:15,994 --> 00:13:17,616
Yes, please help me, Deok Hui.

169
00:13:17,616 --> 00:13:18,908
Shut up.

170
00:13:18,908 --> 00:13:23,250
I'm not helping you. I'm helping Oppa, you crook.

171
00:13:25,684 --> 00:13:28,627
Whoever is trying to tear him apart,

172
00:13:28,627 --> 00:13:31,209
will definitely pay for it.

173
00:13:33,403 --> 00:13:34,983
Let us show them.

174
00:13:34,983 --> 00:13:36,695
The power of Aroha!

175
00:13:36,695 --> 00:13:38,757
Enter.

176
00:13:42,782 --> 00:13:45,374
Comrades, let us unite.

177
00:13:45,374 --> 00:13:47,917
Who is important? Eun Woo is important.

178
00:13:47,917 --> 00:13:49,789
- Who is important?
- Eun Woo!

179
00:13:49,789 --> 00:13:51,840
- Eun Woo!
- Eun Woo!

180
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,382
- Eun Woo!
- All right!

181
00:13:53,382 --> 00:13:55,384
Let's do this! Let's go!

182
00:13:55,384 --> 00:13:56,705
Let's go!

183
00:13:56,705 --> 00:13:59,098
- Gosh.
- What's going on?

184
00:13:59,098 --> 00:14:00,949
Let me see.

185
00:14:04,513 --> 00:14:05,974
IP address lookup

186
00:14:05,974 --> 00:14:07,306
IP tracker.

187
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,763
That's it. Yes.

188
00:14:13,763 --> 00:14:15,774
Zoom in right here.

189
00:14:17,447 --> 00:14:19,718
We're looking for sources regarding Eun Woo's scandal.

190
00:14:36,755 --> 00:14:37,967
Hello?

191
00:14:37,967 --> 00:14:40,389
Ho Gu Hui, we found the IP address of the initial source.

192
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:41,971
- Okay.
- The funny thing is...

193
00:14:41,971 --> 00:14:45,124
it's the Internet café right next to Eun Woo's agency building.

194
00:14:45,124 --> 00:14:49,367
This person kept changing their ID and leaving malicious comments.

195
00:14:49,367 --> 00:14:53,211
The first ID used is "dmsdnzlf".

196
00:14:53,211 --> 00:14:55,063
In the Korean keyboard, it's spelled out as "Eun Woo kill."

197
00:14:55,063 --> 00:14:56,695
We're tracing their personal information.

198
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:58,237
"Eun Woo kill"?

199
00:14:58,237 --> 00:14:59,448
- Okay.
- Yes.

200
00:14:59,448 --> 00:15:02,119
Good work, Deok Hui.

201
00:15:06,825 --> 00:15:09,077
Will you be the Revenge Goddess?
Enter target's name

202
00:15:09,077 --> 00:15:12,581
dmsdnzlf

203
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:19,128
We will proceed with the revenge

204
00:15:25,515 --> 00:15:29,187
Maybe Deok Hui really is the Master.

205
00:15:30,849 --> 00:15:32,941
Wait, no.

206
00:15:34,352 --> 00:15:36,965
Deok Hui would have made a move first.

207
00:15:38,648 --> 00:15:40,288
I don't know.

208
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,723
I don't know who it is,

209
00:15:44,723 --> 00:15:45,935
but please help!

210
00:15:45,935 --> 00:15:48,577
Shocking idol scandal. Suspected to be dating minor

211
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:58,256
You have been selected as a revenge target.

212
00:15:58,256 --> 00:16:00,338
Your misfortune will continue until the revenge is complete.

213
00:16:19,397 --> 00:16:21,490
We can just check the hallway surveillance cameras.

214
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:23,061
We can compare the dates too.

215
00:16:23,061 --> 00:16:26,826
All right then. Team A can check the cameras outside the building,

216
00:16:26,826 --> 00:16:28,867
and Team B can take the inside. Let's move.

217
00:16:28,867 --> 00:16:30,918
- Let's go.
- Okay.

218
00:16:33,703 --> 00:16:35,755
Are you the manager?

219
00:16:35,755 --> 00:16:36,795
Yes.

220
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:40,309
Hello. Could I ask you something?

221
00:16:40,309 --> 00:16:42,160
Yes, what is it?

222
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,614
Oh, this was broken.

223
00:16:44,614 --> 00:16:47,516
Does that mean nothing got recorded?

224
00:16:47,516 --> 00:16:51,270
It doesn't seem to be functioning well because it's so old.

225
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,541
I'm sorry.

226
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:56,864
I guess we can't do anything about it. Thank you anyway.

227
00:17:05,404 --> 00:17:07,786
He looks strangely familiar.

228
00:17:09,327 --> 00:17:11,450
E-Sports Internet Café.

229
00:17:14,873 --> 00:17:18,217
I'll continue to put updates online.

230
00:17:18,217 --> 00:17:19,518
I'll see you all later.

231
00:17:19,518 --> 00:17:22,090
- Good work.
- Good work, everyone.

232
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:24,162
- Good work.
- Goodbye.

233
00:17:51,991 --> 00:17:53,562
Is this the right roof?

234
00:17:53,562 --> 00:17:55,504
I think it is.

235
00:18:03,793 --> 00:18:07,145
I'm pretty sure the video showed this area.

236
00:18:07,145 --> 00:18:09,987
Look harder. We might get more clues.

237
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,181
Isn't this the girl in the video?

238
00:18:13,181 --> 00:18:15,752
Did you find something?

239
00:18:15,752 --> 00:18:17,727
Search, choose face.

240
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:20,148
The account is deactivated now,

241
00:18:20,148 --> 00:18:23,662
but when I ran the program, it seems to be the same person.

242
00:18:25,193 --> 00:18:29,267
Special feature, possibly by plastic surgery

243
00:18:29,267 --> 00:18:32,241
After their Asia concert tour,

244
00:18:32,241 --> 00:18:34,102
Astro has finally landed home.

245
00:18:34,102 --> 00:18:37,226
Regarding the scandal of Astro member Cha Eun Woo,

246
00:18:37,226 --> 00:18:40,439
Cha Eun Woo's fans have gathered the sources of malicious comments

247
00:18:40,439 --> 00:18:42,151
and have submitted them to a lawyer

248
00:18:42,151 --> 00:18:45,044
to clarify any suspicions.

249
00:18:45,044 --> 00:18:48,738
It is still in question whether it is simply a spiteful rumor

250
00:18:48,738 --> 00:18:51,110
or a true unveiling of the idol star

251
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:53,141
wearing the mask of an angel.

252
00:18:53,141 --> 00:18:56,895
The issue is being highlighted with their domestic concert coming up...

253
00:19:09,108 --> 00:19:10,648
Oppa,

254
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:13,451
I'm getting nervous.

255
00:19:14,663 --> 00:19:17,255
What if we actually get caught?

256
00:19:17,255 --> 00:19:20,398
Pack your things and go to the States. Stay with your eonni for now.

257
00:19:20,398 --> 00:19:24,473
Don't contact me for the time being. I'll follow you there you soon.

258
00:19:24,473 --> 00:19:26,824
Okay.

259
00:19:26,824 --> 00:19:29,518
The noisier it gets, the larger the amount will become.

260
00:19:29,518 --> 00:19:30,950
I'll contact you soon.

261
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:33,060
Be careful, okay?

262
00:19:49,108 --> 00:19:50,739
It's late.

263
00:19:50,739 --> 00:19:54,053
I'll go and eat the Eun Woo Set

264
00:19:54,053 --> 00:19:56,725
and then I'll go to the meeting.

265
00:20:25,855 --> 00:20:27,816
Gosh, that scared me.

266
00:20:36,365 --> 00:20:38,708
We could've just grabbed something near the hagwon*,
(*private cram school)

267
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:41,060
but you insist on having chicken again.

268
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:43,481
You're obsessed with chicken these days.

269
00:20:43,481 --> 00:20:45,583
Hey, I've always liked chicken.

270
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:48,586
That is definitely a lie.

271
00:20:48,586 --> 00:20:50,588
- What's this?
- What?

272
00:20:54,884 --> 00:20:56,635
Isn't this...

273
00:21:23,202 --> 00:21:24,793
- Did you get the license plate?
- What?

274
00:21:25,744 --> 00:21:26,916
It's HA 13...

275
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:29,397
- It's 2745.
- Yes, 2745.

276
00:21:37,006 --> 00:21:39,557
International Terminal

277
00:21:49,147 --> 00:21:52,360
Departures.

278
00:22:18,507 --> 00:22:20,397
Look over there.

279
00:22:53,461 --> 00:22:55,834
HA 13

280
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:58,257
7544...

281
00:22:58,257 --> 00:23:00,929
No, it's 2745.

282
00:23:02,971 --> 00:23:04,402
I know.

283
00:23:09,647 --> 00:23:11,219
Hey.

284
00:23:14,353 --> 00:23:16,234
13 HA 2745

285
00:23:17,606 --> 00:23:19,258
Hey,

286
00:23:19,258 --> 00:23:22,181
call the police first just in case.

287
00:23:22,181 --> 00:23:23,812
Okay.

288
00:23:29,788 --> 00:23:31,049
Hello?

289
00:23:31,049 --> 00:23:35,133
I'm calling because I think my friend has been kidnapped.

290
00:23:36,045 --> 00:23:39,588
Where are we? We are...

291
00:23:39,588 --> 00:23:41,930
in front of the Internet café.

292
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:43,872
It's at Chorongmaeul-ro 3-gil.

293
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,834
Please hurry.

294
00:23:47,435 --> 00:23:53,062
Ben E-Sports Internet Café

295
00:24:03,571 --> 00:24:04,953
Be quiet.

296
00:24:05,743 --> 00:24:09,557
I'll keep you for half a day and let you go, so just stay still.

297
00:24:11,209 --> 00:24:13,791
I told you to be quiet.

298
00:24:13,791 --> 00:24:16,494
Who are you to ruin everything?

299
00:24:16,494 --> 00:24:19,128
My life was ruined because of that punk.

300
00:24:19,128 --> 00:24:21,030
Why are you getting involved?

301
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:23,571
If it wasn't for that punk,

302
00:24:24,512 --> 00:24:28,146
you wouldn't be stuck here in an Internet café like this.

303
00:24:45,783 --> 00:24:48,306
- Let go of me!
- Stay still!

304
00:24:52,161 --> 00:24:53,881
Are you okay?

305
00:24:56,044 --> 00:24:58,786
This is just crazy.

306
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,751
Hurry.

307
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:07,315
Let me go! Let go of me, you punk!

308
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,103
Why are you doing this? What did I do?

309
00:25:15,103 --> 00:25:16,875
- Step aside!
- My gosh.

310
00:25:16,875 --> 00:25:18,187
- Step aside!
- Darn it.

311
00:25:18,187 --> 00:25:19,877
Let me go!

312
00:25:20,608 --> 00:25:22,720
Let go of me!

313
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,653
This isn't fair!

314
00:25:26,235 --> 00:25:28,726
I don't deserve this! This isn't fair!

315
00:25:28,726 --> 00:25:30,688
- How do you feel?
- This is unfair!

316
00:25:30,688 --> 00:25:32,130
We have no time for that.

317
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:33,592
This is unfair!

318
00:25:33,592 --> 00:25:35,193
Do you want to say something?

319
00:25:35,193 --> 00:25:37,015
Wait a second!

320
00:25:40,628 --> 00:25:44,863
I was walking with Ji Hun when we found the doll.

321
00:25:44,863 --> 00:25:47,676
So I picked it up

322
00:25:47,676 --> 00:25:50,148
and saw a car driving away.

323
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:52,581
I saw Deok Hui inside.

324
00:25:52,581 --> 00:25:55,124
The doll must be precious to you.

325
00:25:55,124 --> 00:25:57,876
Yes, it's the doll

326
00:25:57,876 --> 00:26:00,879
of an idol group that I like.

327
00:26:00,879 --> 00:26:03,232
I dropped it

328
00:26:03,232 --> 00:26:05,144
and I guess these guys saw it.

329
00:26:05,144 --> 00:26:07,265
And so...

330
00:26:07,265 --> 00:26:09,157
Well,

331
00:26:09,157 --> 00:26:12,351
my boyfriend was originally a member of Astro,

332
00:26:12,351 --> 00:26:14,393
but he was replaced with Eun Woo.

333
00:26:14,393 --> 00:26:18,086
He trained for a few years and never even got to debut.

334
00:26:18,086 --> 00:26:20,609
Woman arrested for falsely accusing pop Idol Cha Eun Woo.

335
00:26:20,609 --> 00:26:23,181
We were going to

336
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:25,522
split the settlement money.

337
00:26:29,468 --> 00:26:33,081
Fans of Astro have played a big part in solving this incident.

338
00:26:33,081 --> 00:26:35,804
Through the surveillance footage submitted by an anonymous individual

339
00:26:35,804 --> 00:26:38,627
and a hacking program, they have obtained conclusive evidence.

340
00:26:38,627 --> 00:26:40,078
- What a relief.
 - The offender was

341
00:26:40,078 --> 00:26:43,562
a trainee disqualified from Astro due to Cha Eun Woo.

342
00:26:43,562 --> 00:26:47,265
His grudge led him to consistently post malicious comments,

343
00:26:47,265 --> 00:26:51,119
and he even made up a false scandal for a large sum of settlement money.

344
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:53,270
He has come forward with his confession.

345
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:57,815
- Yes?
- Gu Hui,

346
00:26:57,815 --> 00:26:59,507
it's me, Deok Hui.

347
00:26:59,507 --> 00:27:02,231
Deok Hui, are you all right?

348
00:27:02,231 --> 00:27:05,394
Yes, I'm all right.

349
00:27:05,394 --> 00:27:06,975
But, Gu Hui,

350
00:27:06,975 --> 00:27:11,350
could you please get me a ticket to the concert?

351
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:14,162
I couldn't get it.

352
00:27:17,725 --> 00:27:20,018
Okay, I will.

353
00:27:20,018 --> 00:27:21,971
I'll try to get one for you.

354
00:27:21,971 --> 00:27:25,854
Thanks so much.

355
00:27:25,854 --> 00:27:28,136
I love you, my friend.

356
00:27:28,136 --> 00:27:30,118
Okay.

357
00:27:50,339 --> 00:27:52,760
Woman arrested for falsely accusing pop Idol Cha Eun Woo.

358
00:27:59,888 --> 00:28:02,341
Since Deok Hui was kidnapped,

359
00:28:02,341 --> 00:28:04,772
it probably isn't her.

360
00:28:06,104 --> 00:28:08,025
Then is it Eun Woo?

361
00:28:09,237 --> 00:28:12,379
No way. Eun Woo was the victim.

362
00:28:13,822 --> 00:28:17,634
I don't know. I'm getting more confused.

363
00:28:25,793 --> 00:28:28,777
Your revenge is complete.

364
00:28:28,777 --> 00:28:31,830
STAFF

365
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:33,301
I love Astro

366
00:28:33,301 --> 00:28:35,973
- Astro!
- I love him.

367
00:28:35,973 --> 00:28:37,386
Astro!

368
00:28:39,016 --> 00:28:41,169
- I love them.
- I'm so nervous.

369
00:28:41,169 --> 00:28:42,891
Let's go. I'm nervous.

370
00:28:45,934 --> 00:28:49,026
Since I've got our tickets, you need to double my allowance.

371
00:28:49,026 --> 00:28:51,569
All right. Gosh.

372
00:28:51,569 --> 00:28:54,322
I'm so nervous. Should I keep my glasses on or off?

373
00:28:54,322 --> 00:28:55,614
- Take them off.
- Ms. Jeong Deok Hui?

374
00:28:55,614 --> 00:28:57,065
Yes?

375
00:28:58,326 --> 00:29:00,188
This way, please.

376
00:29:00,188 --> 00:29:01,939
What's going on?

377
00:29:01,939 --> 00:29:03,891
- No!
- No way!

378
00:29:09,587 --> 00:29:11,809
- Please come this way.
- Okay.

379
00:29:13,511 --> 00:29:16,153
- Wait here for just a moment.
- Sure.

380
00:29:18,176 --> 00:29:20,108
They're in there.

381
00:29:20,108 --> 00:29:21,790
What do we do?

382
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:23,192
My heart is about to explode.

383
00:29:23,192 --> 00:29:25,343
Have fun at the concert.

384
00:29:29,066 --> 00:29:31,179
- You can come in now.
- Ah, yes.

385
00:29:31,179 --> 00:29:33,160
They're over there.

386
00:29:34,733 --> 00:29:37,495
- Hello.
- Hello.

387
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:25,243
You don't really have to eat it now. It might get on your shirt.

388
00:30:25,243 --> 00:30:27,355
You have to do the concert.

389
00:30:34,382 --> 00:30:35,544
It's amazing, Nuna*.
(*"elder sister", said by a male)

390
00:30:35,544 --> 00:30:38,206
What did he just say? Nuna*?
(Normally, a married woman her age would be called "ajumma")

391
00:30:40,428 --> 00:30:43,872
I also enjoyed the soy sauce marinated crab you gave me yesterday.

392
00:30:43,872 --> 00:30:45,914
- It's so good.
- Nuna?

393
00:30:45,914 --> 00:30:47,766
Nuna, take a picture with us.

394
00:30:48,606 --> 00:30:50,178
Okay.

395
00:30:54,022 --> 00:30:55,233
I'll be back.

396
00:30:55,233 --> 00:30:57,744
- See you.
- What do I do?

397
00:31:00,408 --> 00:31:02,359
There's the camera.

398
00:31:04,533 --> 00:31:06,203
One, two, three.

399
00:31:07,375 --> 00:31:09,005
Three.

400
00:31:13,001 --> 00:31:14,631
You look so handsome.

401
00:31:15,713 --> 00:31:18,106
One, two, three.

402
00:31:19,216 --> 00:31:21,299
- Let's take one more. I think I blinked.
- Okay.

403
00:31:21,299 --> 00:31:24,493
I'm sorry. My mom's a little weird.

404
00:31:24,493 --> 00:31:26,355
No, it's all right.

405
00:31:26,355 --> 00:31:28,236
I'm the one who's thankful.

406
00:31:28,236 --> 00:31:31,839
By the way, are you all right? I heard you almost got hurt.

407
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:34,641
I'm all right. I'm perfectly fine.

408
00:31:36,984 --> 00:31:41,009
After the concert, let's have chicken together

409
00:31:41,009 --> 00:31:44,992
at Gu Hui's restaurant, oppa.

410
00:31:44,992 --> 00:31:47,514
Sure. Let's definitely do that.

411
00:31:48,617 --> 00:31:50,097
Yum.

412
00:31:58,506 --> 00:32:00,699
~ Revenge Note 1 ~
[Preview]

413
00:32:00,699 --> 00:32:02,910
I like Ji Hun. Can you help me out?

414
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:05,273
Look at her so obviously hitting on him.

415
00:32:05,273 --> 00:32:06,555
Forget it. Don't do it.

416
00:32:06,555 --> 00:32:07,806
Don't bring Gu Hui into this.

417
00:32:07,806 --> 00:32:10,588
Wait and see. I'll make your life miserable.

418
00:32:10,588 --> 00:32:12,140
You two look great together.

419
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:14,271
What do you mean, we broke up? We were just having a fight.

420
00:32:14,271 --> 00:32:16,893
So please stop being interested in me.
