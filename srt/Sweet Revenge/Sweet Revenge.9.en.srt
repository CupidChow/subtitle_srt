Episode 9

9
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:36,647
I don't normally

10
00:00:36,647 --> 00:00:39,419
cause others inconvenience like this.

11
00:00:39,419 --> 00:00:41,381
It's fine. It can happen if you're in a hurry.

12
00:00:41,381 --> 00:00:44,004
- I'm sorry. Here.
- Yes?

13
00:00:44,004 --> 00:00:45,956
I'll give you a coupon as a token of gratitude.

14
00:00:45,956 --> 00:00:48,008
Thank you.

15
00:00:48,008 --> 00:00:50,510
- Goodbye.
- Thank you.

16
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:53,023
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

17
00:00:53,023 --> 00:00:54,754
Teacher!

18
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:56,436
Min Ah.

19
00:00:58,018 --> 00:00:59,719
This is for you.

20
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:01,842
It turned out so well, so I brought it for you.

21
00:01:01,842 --> 00:01:04,073
You didn't have to do this.

22
00:01:04,073 --> 00:01:05,574
It's all right.

23
00:01:06,657 --> 00:01:08,197
It smells good.

24
00:01:08,197 --> 00:01:09,769
Really?

25
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:12,331
- Did you make it yourself?
- Yes.

26
00:01:12,331 --> 00:01:15,495
Ah, I really can't believe you did that.

27
00:01:15,495 --> 00:01:18,248
You pooped at that teacher's house?

28
00:01:18,248 --> 00:01:21,130
It takes at least half a day to ventilate the smell of your poop.

29
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:23,182
This is so embarrassing.

30
00:01:23,182 --> 00:01:25,965
No, it smelled okay that day.

31
00:01:25,965 --> 00:01:27,887
Whatever.

32
00:01:27,887 --> 00:01:30,890
I should sew up that hole of yours.

33
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:34,505
We're eating, so can we stop talking about poop already?

34
00:01:34,505 --> 00:01:37,987
Should we? I'm sorry, son.

35
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:52,571
Oh my goodness. Hey.

36
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:55,565
Min Ah exposed her love story on the Hanjong High online community.

37
00:01:55,565 --> 00:01:57,428
- Really?
- Goodness.

38
00:01:57,428 --> 00:01:59,569
"April 27th,

39
00:01:59,569 --> 00:02:03,653
he looked at me with such sweet eyes.

40
00:02:03,653 --> 00:02:05,886
I felt like I was being treasured."

41
00:02:05,886 --> 00:02:08,679
"April 29th at the music room,

42
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:11,010
I saw the teacher hunched over the piano.

43
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:12,973
I got so alarmed and went inside."

44
00:02:12,973 --> 00:02:16,436
"Teacher, are you all right? Teacher!"

45
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:18,548
Teacher, are you all right?

46
00:02:18,548 --> 00:02:20,090
Teacher?

47
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:23,783
I'm all right now that I saw you, my Min Ah.

48
00:02:26,106 --> 00:02:27,406
Keep listening.

49
00:02:27,406 --> 00:02:30,991
"He reached out his hand without lifting his head

50
00:02:30,991 --> 00:02:33,322
and pulled my waist."

51
00:02:33,322 --> 00:02:35,005
Are you out of your mind?

52
00:02:35,005 --> 00:02:37,667
- Keep reading.
- "Sunlight filled the music room".

53
00:02:37,667 --> 00:02:39,610
"When his hands approached me after playing the piano..."

54
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:43,082
"Sunlight filled the music room".

55
00:02:43,082 --> 00:02:46,726
When his hands approached me after playing the piano,

56
00:02:47,718 --> 00:02:50,680
our two hearts became one..

57
00:02:53,683 --> 00:02:55,104
They became one.

58
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,435
"April 30th."

59
00:02:56,435 --> 00:02:58,307
"We went for a movie, not even daytime,"

60
00:02:59,188 --> 00:03:01,210
"but late-night."

61
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:02,332
Really?

62
00:03:02,332 --> 00:03:04,394
"We sat in our seats in the theater with our popcorn,"

63
00:03:04,394 --> 00:03:07,277
"but the seats next to ours were empty."

64
00:03:07,277 --> 00:03:08,739
Why?

65
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:09,990
"He whispered."

66
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:12,972
"'I didn't want us to get disturbed, so I reserved all the seats."

67
00:03:12,972 --> 00:03:15,364
"I want the two of us to be alone.'"

68
00:03:15,364 --> 00:03:16,656
"From that day on..."

69
00:03:16,656 --> 00:03:20,459
From that day on, he became my oppa.

70
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:21,881
Oppa.

71
00:03:21,881 --> 00:03:23,603
Oppa.

72
00:03:26,465 --> 00:03:28,068
- "Oppa."
- "Oppa."

73
00:03:28,068 --> 00:03:29,920
- "Oppa."
- How sweet.

74
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,781
"Oppa."

75
00:03:31,781 --> 00:03:34,633
"On our way back from the movie in his car,"

76
00:03:34,633 --> 00:03:38,497
"I fell asleep because I was too tired, then I felt like we were almost there."

77
00:03:38,497 --> 00:03:42,082
"The car stopped, and I was awake,"

78
00:03:42,082 --> 00:03:44,234
"but I couldn't open my eyes."

79
00:03:44,234 --> 00:03:46,276
" 'Why won't he wake me up?' "

80
00:03:47,437 --> 00:03:50,860
" When I opened my eyes, pretending to turn over in my sleep,"

81
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:54,484
"his nose approached and touched mine."

82
00:03:56,155 --> 00:03:58,397
It's not holding hands this time.

83
00:03:58,397 --> 00:04:00,200
- It's a kiss.
- It's a kiss.

84
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,001
Oh my goodness.

85
00:04:02,001 --> 00:04:04,873
- It's so heart-fluttering.
- My gosh.

86
00:04:05,956 --> 00:04:07,637
Goodness me.

87
00:04:08,588 --> 00:04:10,510
Oh gosh.

88
00:04:14,214 --> 00:04:16,016
- It's so heart-fluttering.
- My gosh.

89
00:04:16,016 --> 00:04:18,748
It's so exciting.

90
00:04:18,748 --> 00:04:22,121
She should've posted a little more while she was at it.

91
00:04:22,121 --> 00:04:23,283
My goodness.

92
00:04:23,283 --> 00:04:25,775
My dad went for a delivery

93
00:04:25,775 --> 00:04:27,677
and saw Min Ah going into Teacher Eum's house.

94
00:04:27,677 --> 00:04:31,221
Seriously? She even frequented his house?

95
00:04:31,221 --> 00:04:33,724
Then the later parts of the story would be rated R.

96
00:04:33,724 --> 00:04:36,285
Gosh, I'm so curious. I can't wait.

97
00:04:36,285 --> 00:04:39,980
This isn't fan fiction. It's a true story.

98
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:43,042
It's not a joke.

99
00:04:43,042 --> 00:04:44,823
Sorry.

100
00:04:49,298 --> 00:04:51,100
Principal's office

101
00:05:07,477 --> 00:05:10,010
- I don't think it'll last long.
- Right?

102
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,631
- No way.
- Is this real?

103
00:05:11,631 --> 00:05:13,571
Hey, quiet.

104
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,873
You're a sex offender under a handsome mask

105
00:05:22,873 --> 00:05:25,204
Did you reserve all seats to not be disturbed?

106
00:05:25,204 --> 00:05:26,596
We don't need an offender teacher

107
00:05:26,596 --> 00:05:28,207
Get out of this school

108
00:05:28,207 --> 00:05:30,029
And you call yourself a teacher?

109
00:05:42,893 --> 00:05:44,834
We're going to talk about music theory today.

110
00:05:44,834 --> 00:05:47,336
Open up your books to page 28.

111
00:05:47,336 --> 00:05:49,849
How can he call himself a teacher?

112
00:05:52,061 --> 00:05:53,082
Get out of here.

113
00:05:53,082 --> 00:05:54,663
- You're a piece of trash.
- Get lost.

114
00:05:54,663 --> 00:05:56,045
- You can't be a teacher.
- Get out.

115
00:05:56,045 --> 00:05:57,277
How could you do such a thing?

116
00:05:57,277 --> 00:05:59,409
- Just get out of here.
- We don't need you.

117
00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:03,163
- How could you do this?
- You're unbelievable.

118
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:05,224
- You came here to teach?
- Gosh.

119
00:06:05,224 --> 00:06:07,037
- You're a piece of trash.
- Exactly.

120
00:06:07,037 --> 00:06:09,278
- He can't teach us.
- I know.

121
00:06:09,278 --> 00:06:11,421
- Just get out.
- Get out of here.

122
00:06:11,421 --> 00:06:15,013
- We don't want you.
- Get out.

123
00:06:17,047 --> 00:06:18,988
Enter target's name

124
00:06:18,988 --> 00:06:22,141
Eum Chi Hun

125
00:06:22,141 --> 00:06:23,783
Should I send it?

126
00:06:25,014 --> 00:06:26,786
Should I not?

127
00:06:28,647 --> 00:06:30,640
What should I do?

128
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:42,572
How are we supposed to do a group assignment

129
00:06:42,572 --> 00:06:44,324
when the whole school is in total chaos?

130
00:06:44,324 --> 00:06:47,006
Just look at our group members.

131
00:06:49,748 --> 00:06:51,962
Why did we have to group up with you two, out of all people?

132
00:06:51,962 --> 00:06:55,954
Tell me about it. Group assignments are all about teamwork.

133
00:06:57,796 --> 00:06:59,798
I'm not confident. Maybe I should give up.

134
00:06:59,798 --> 00:07:04,062
Shut it. Do you want to go down all together?

135
00:07:04,062 --> 00:07:05,935
It's a performance assessment for our Korean language class.

136
00:07:05,935 --> 00:07:09,518
Right. We have to finish the assignment in two days.

137
00:07:09,518 --> 00:07:11,020
Let's start off with anything.

138
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:13,722
All right. Let's do it.

139
00:07:13,722 --> 00:07:17,896
Trust me. I'll make sure our group gets an A-plus on this assignment.

140
00:07:18,989 --> 00:07:20,599
Do you even know what the assignment is about?

141
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:22,601
No, I don't.

142
00:07:22,601 --> 00:07:24,573
- Goodness.
- Gosh.

143
00:07:24,573 --> 00:07:26,484
- Good for you.
- We're doomed.

144
00:07:27,786 --> 00:07:29,908
Have some snacks, girls.

145
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:32,131
- Here.
- That's a lot.

146
00:07:32,131 --> 00:07:35,694
You'll gain about three kilograms by the time you leave our house.

147
00:07:35,694 --> 00:07:37,046
Brace yourselves.

148
00:07:37,046 --> 00:07:39,738
- They look delicious.
- Thank you.

149
00:07:39,738 --> 00:07:43,772
Enjoy the food. You look so pretty.

150
00:07:45,385 --> 00:07:47,396
"Novel Analysis.

151
00:07:47,396 --> 00:07:51,100
The Square by Choi In Hun. Our Twisted Hero by Yi Mun Yol."

152
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,173
Do you still do homework with stuff like this?

153
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:54,984
Gosh, it sucks.

154
00:07:54,984 --> 00:07:57,887
Why don't you use some cool Internet novels instead?

155
00:07:57,887 --> 00:08:00,238
Those are fun.

156
00:08:03,192 --> 00:08:05,344
That's actually a good idea.

157
00:08:05,344 --> 00:08:07,246
- Girls, look it up.
- Let's look it up.

158
00:08:07,246 --> 00:08:09,248
- Internet novel?
- Internet novel it is.

159
00:08:09,248 --> 00:08:11,661
My mom is the first generation of idol fans.

160
00:08:11,661 --> 00:08:13,622
It should be fun since she recommended it.

161
00:08:13,622 --> 00:08:16,374
Hey, what was the title again?

162
00:08:16,374 --> 00:08:19,809
"I Still Love You Though I'm a Teacher and You're a Student".

163
00:08:19,809 --> 00:08:21,590
Isn't this much lamer?

164
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:23,953
I can't find it.

165
00:08:23,953 --> 00:08:26,064
The account seems to have expired.

166
00:08:27,516 --> 00:08:29,098
Wait. I found it.

167
00:08:29,098 --> 00:08:31,020
- Isn't this the one?
- Let me see.

168
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,282
I think it's right.

169
00:08:32,282 --> 00:08:33,973
- It's the one.
- This.

170
00:08:33,973 --> 00:08:36,065
- It's right.
- Right?

171
00:08:36,065 --> 00:08:37,636
Right?

172
00:08:37,636 --> 00:08:40,510
Let's see. It was written in 2002.

173
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:42,952
It means we were...

174
00:08:42,952 --> 00:08:44,883
We were a year old then.

175
00:08:44,883 --> 00:08:47,906
- It's amazing.
- The account name is "Kye Sang's Wife"?

176
00:08:47,906 --> 00:08:49,619
- Kye Sang's Wife.
- Kye Sang's Wife?

177
00:08:49,619 --> 00:08:53,202
I think it's Yun Kye Sang of g.o.d.

178
00:08:53,202 --> 00:08:54,744
Did you say "g.o.d"?

179
00:08:54,744 --> 00:08:56,585
Oh, those ajussis?

180
00:08:56,585 --> 00:08:58,667
How did you get it right away?

181
00:08:58,667 --> 00:09:01,390
It's because we always play old-time songs in our restaurant.

182
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:03,802
The story seems nice.

183
00:09:03,802 --> 00:09:07,825
It's no literature, but it's realistic.

184
00:09:07,825 --> 00:09:10,790
"I ran inside the messy science room with the exploded beakers

185
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:13,543
when I saw Mr. Yun hunched over.

186
00:09:13,543 --> 00:09:17,275
'Are you all right, Teacher Yun? Teacher!'

187
00:09:17,275 --> 00:09:21,730
He reached out his hand without lifting his head and pulled my waist."

188
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:22,941
What's this?

189
00:09:22,941 --> 00:09:25,114
"'I'm all right now that I saw you.'

190
00:09:25,114 --> 00:09:28,867
Sunlight filled the science room. When his hands approached me,

191
00:09:28,867 --> 00:09:31,480
our two hearts became one."

192
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,493
- They became one.
- Goodness.

193
00:09:34,493 --> 00:09:37,187
"We went for a movie, not even daytime, but late-night."

194
00:09:37,187 --> 00:09:38,418
"Late-night," she says.

195
00:09:38,418 --> 00:09:40,839
"We sat in our seats at the theater with our popcorn,

196
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:43,543
but the seats next to ours were empty.

197
00:09:43,543 --> 00:09:45,044
Teacher Yun whispered,

198
00:09:45,044 --> 00:09:47,346
'I didn't want to get disturbed, so I reserved all the seats.

199
00:09:47,346 --> 00:09:49,748
I want the two of us to be alone.'"

200
00:09:49,748 --> 00:09:52,770
- Goodness.
- Gosh, it's so sweet.

201
00:09:55,555 --> 00:09:56,875
Hold on a second.

202
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,797
Wait.

203
00:09:58,797 --> 00:10:00,269
Don't you think it sounds familiar?

204
00:10:00,359 --> 00:10:02,212
No way. It came out when we were a year old.

205
00:10:02,212 --> 00:10:04,344
No.

206
00:10:04,344 --> 00:10:06,305
Hey.

207
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:09,648
It's Heo Min Ah's love story.

208
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,622
You're right.

209
00:10:27,005 --> 00:10:29,508
We came to see her,

210
00:10:29,508 --> 00:10:30,990
but what should we tell her?

211
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:34,624
Are we going to ask her directly if she lied?

212
00:10:34,624 --> 00:10:36,346
I don't know.

213
00:10:36,346 --> 00:10:39,197
Let's try throwing a bait at least.

214
00:10:50,199 --> 00:10:53,602
Hey, are you all right?

215
00:10:53,602 --> 00:10:56,234
Are you feeling any better?

216
00:10:58,207 --> 00:11:00,199
It's so-so.

217
00:11:07,836 --> 00:11:11,470
Are you sure this is all true?

218
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,482
Is it 100 percent your story?

219
00:11:16,015 --> 00:11:18,546
Are you still suspicious of me?

220
00:11:22,731 --> 00:11:25,844
Well... I mean...

221
00:11:25,844 --> 00:11:28,467
Maybe you copied it from somewhere.

222
00:11:28,467 --> 00:11:31,281
I'm asking you just in case,

223
00:11:31,281 --> 00:11:33,671
since it's a serious matter.

224
00:11:36,455 --> 00:11:37,966
Deok Hui.

225
00:11:39,158 --> 00:11:42,111
We really

226
00:11:42,111 --> 00:11:43,832
loved each other.

227
00:11:45,123 --> 00:11:46,975
My oppa...

228
00:11:48,668 --> 00:11:51,050
I mean, Teacher Eum

229
00:11:52,051 --> 00:11:55,304
must be in some kind of trouble right now.

230
00:11:57,726 --> 00:12:00,218
I'm regretting it too.

231
00:12:02,351 --> 00:12:05,883
I posted our story online because I felt so resentful,

232
00:12:08,818 --> 00:12:12,190
but it was a story between just the two of us

233
00:12:13,612 --> 00:12:16,504
that I didn't want to share with anyone else.

234
00:12:35,384 --> 00:12:37,517
Maybe it's true.

235
00:12:37,517 --> 00:12:40,539
You saw her crying earlier as well.

236
00:12:40,539 --> 00:12:43,052
It didn't seem fake at all.

237
00:12:45,774 --> 00:12:47,686
I'm freaking out a bit.

238
00:12:47,686 --> 00:12:49,898
I think she has sort of a mental problem.

239
00:12:49,898 --> 00:12:52,411
She believes it's real when it's actually not.

240
00:12:53,652 --> 00:12:56,415
Something like mythomania.

241
00:13:14,303 --> 00:13:16,386
Guys, it's finally happened!

242
00:13:16,386 --> 00:13:19,788
I just came back from...

243
00:13:30,859 --> 00:13:33,072
I came to school

244
00:13:33,072 --> 00:13:36,375
with him in his car every morning.

245
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,678
She lived next building in the same apartment complex.

246
00:13:38,678 --> 00:13:42,170
I gave her a ride a few times when we ran into each other at the entrance.

247
00:13:44,202 --> 00:13:47,736
This is the phone case he gave me.

248
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,692
This is our matching t-shirt.

249
00:13:58,757 --> 00:14:00,918
And this is our matching mug cup.

250
00:14:03,433 --> 00:14:06,414
There are more of these.

251
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:12,842
I also own these things.

252
00:14:12,842 --> 00:14:15,915
But I didn't know Heo Min Ah had the same.

253
00:14:15,915 --> 00:14:18,897
I went to his house often too.

254
00:14:20,489 --> 00:14:23,531
We would lay down and watch TV together.

255
00:14:25,825 --> 00:14:28,317
She brought me food a few times.

256
00:14:28,317 --> 00:14:30,168
I felt a little uncomfortable,

257
00:14:30,168 --> 00:14:34,113
but I only accepted it with gratitude because she was so low-spirited in school.

258
00:14:34,113 --> 00:14:37,155
I sent her back at the doorstep. I never let her in my house, not even once.

259
00:14:37,155 --> 00:14:42,350
This is wrong, and my engagement is about to be called off.

260
00:14:43,642 --> 00:14:46,054
Omo, are you all right?

261
00:14:46,054 --> 00:14:48,917
Should I give you some painkillers if you have a stomachache?

262
00:14:48,917 --> 00:14:52,360
No, I don't take medicine.

263
00:14:55,023 --> 00:14:57,225
- Teacher Jeong.
- Yes?

264
00:14:58,947 --> 00:15:01,619
I'm pregnant.

265
00:15:04,413 --> 00:15:06,324
She's pregnant?

266
00:15:06,324 --> 00:15:07,976
- What?
- I think she's lying.

267
00:15:07,976 --> 00:15:10,287
- Seriously?
- Really?

268
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:13,972
- No way.
- Really?

269
00:15:13,972 --> 00:15:16,575
- Her belly is...
- That's possible.

270
00:15:18,587 --> 00:15:20,009
Shush.

271
00:15:34,232 --> 00:15:36,134
She's scary.

272
00:15:36,134 --> 00:15:39,196
How far is Heo Min Ah going to go?

273
00:15:40,699 --> 00:15:44,402
It might be too cruel for her, but we have to reveal the truth.

274
00:15:57,255 --> 00:15:58,417
Enter target's name

275
00:15:58,417 --> 00:16:00,178
Heo Min Ah

276
00:16:00,178 --> 00:16:02,621
It's not a revenge.

277
00:16:03,592 --> 00:16:08,065
We need to put an end to this for your sake.

278
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:11,079
Heo Min Ah
Send.

279
00:16:11,079 --> 00:16:13,271
We will proceed with the revenge

280
00:16:17,856 --> 00:16:20,639
We've analyzed Internet novels.

281
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,792
What we've prepared for today's presentation was

282
00:16:22,792 --> 00:16:26,364
written in 2002 and worked as a guideline for the earlier fan fictions.

283
00:16:26,364 --> 00:16:30,619
The title is "I Still Love You Though I'm a Teacher and You're a Student".

284
00:16:30,619 --> 00:16:33,121
It's written by Kye Sang's Wife.

285
00:16:33,121 --> 00:16:36,775
It became the talk of the town when it was released in 2002.

286
00:16:36,775 --> 00:16:40,759
It is also regarded as a work that gave rise to more fan fiction novels.

287
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:44,332
We'll get more in-depth in our presentation with some excerpts.

288
00:16:45,715 --> 00:16:49,307
The following is part of the novel.

289
00:16:49,307 --> 00:16:51,920
"I ran inside the messy science room with the exploded beakers"

290
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,083
"when I saw Teacher Yun hunched over."

291
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:59,008
'Are you all right, Teacher Yun? Teacher!'

292
00:16:59,008 --> 00:17:04,013
"He reached out his hand without lifting his head and pulled my waist."

293
00:17:04,013 --> 00:17:07,847
" 'I'm all right now that I saw you.' "

294
00:17:07,847 --> 00:17:09,909
"Sunlight filled the science room."

295
00:17:09,909 --> 00:17:14,232
"When his hands approached me, our two hearts became one."

296
00:17:14,232 --> 00:17:17,526
Firstly, abbreviations were used in this text.

297
00:17:17,526 --> 00:17:19,688
Secondly, metaphors were used.

298
00:17:19,688 --> 00:17:22,862
Thirdly, excessive interjections were used.

299
00:17:22,862 --> 00:17:25,564
That's it for our presentation.

300
00:17:25,564 --> 00:17:27,335
Thank you.

301
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,941
Good job.

302
00:17:32,941 --> 00:17:37,005
It was brilliant of you to choose a lesser-known piece for the presentation.

303
00:17:37,005 --> 00:17:40,989
Let's end our class here for today.

304
00:17:43,111 --> 00:17:45,274
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

305
00:17:45,274 --> 00:17:48,177
Hey, Heo Min Ah, what was that about?

306
00:17:48,177 --> 00:17:51,379
Goodness. Say something.

307
00:17:52,661 --> 00:17:55,573
I swear that I've never read such a thing.

308
00:17:57,876 --> 00:18:00,318
You guys...

309
00:18:00,318 --> 00:18:02,861
You guys are really horrible.

310
00:18:10,098 --> 00:18:12,290
- What's wrong?
- Gosh.

311
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:13,752
What's wrong with her?

312
00:18:13,752 --> 00:18:15,714
- Should we call someone?
- What?

313
00:18:16,685 --> 00:18:18,396
Should we call a teacher?

314
00:18:18,396 --> 00:18:20,218
Call the teacher.

315
00:18:21,771 --> 00:18:22,912
What do we do?

316
00:18:22,912 --> 00:18:24,613
What should we do?

317
00:18:24,613 --> 00:18:26,515
She's...

318
00:18:26,515 --> 00:18:31,791
is not pregnant. It's a false pregnancy.

319
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:33,432
What?

320
00:18:33,432 --> 00:18:35,313
What...

321
00:18:35,313 --> 00:18:37,706
She said she kept dry heaving

322
00:18:37,706 --> 00:18:39,578
since a few days ago.

323
00:18:39,578 --> 00:18:41,791
Actual symptoms for pregnancy may appear

324
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,782
in the worst cases.

325
00:18:43,782 --> 00:18:47,456
She should get psychotherapy along with her treatment.

326
00:18:48,587 --> 00:18:50,348
Goodness.

327
00:19:04,482 --> 00:19:07,176
Are you all aware that a student in our class got in trouble

328
00:19:07,176 --> 00:19:09,519
for stealing someone else's social media account?

329
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:10,889
Yes.

330
00:19:10,889 --> 00:19:15,614
You guys are part of the problem, being on social media all day long.

331
00:19:15,614 --> 00:19:18,997
Refrain yourselves before I take your phones away.

332
00:19:18,997 --> 00:19:21,490
- Yes.
- That's all.

333
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,443
So what happened is

334
00:19:24,443 --> 00:19:28,466
that Min Ah copied and pasted what was posted on Mr. Eum's girlfriend's account?

335
00:19:28,466 --> 00:19:30,800
It looks it got reported.

336
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:35,233
All the pictures uploaded by Min Ah turned out to be fake and fabricated.

337
00:19:38,557 --> 00:19:40,669
She had another account.

338
00:19:40,669 --> 00:19:44,031
His face was included in all the pictures uploaded there.

339
00:19:47,485 --> 00:19:49,457
Check this out.

Korea University Hospital, Heo Min Ha

341
00:20:05,624 --> 00:20:08,718
Are you mad at me, Teacher Eum?

342
00:20:08,718 --> 00:20:12,200
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

343
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:16,345
It's all right even if you get married.

344
00:20:16,345 --> 00:20:18,877
So...

345
00:20:18,877 --> 00:20:22,019
let's go back to how things were between us.

346
00:20:23,182 --> 00:20:24,722
Okay?

347
00:21:05,895 --> 00:21:11,050
"Pythagorean tuning is the interval defined on the basis of the perfect fifth.

Modulations can't be made as intervals get too narrow."

349
00:21:16,364 --> 00:21:19,498
Teacher Eum returned to how he was,

350
00:21:19,498 --> 00:21:22,300
but he doesn't smile anymore like he did in the past.

Traces of Min Ah

353
00:21:29,848 --> 00:21:33,652
disappeared completely

354
00:21:33,652 --> 00:21:36,114
as if she never existed.

355
00:21:39,888 --> 00:21:42,901
Your revenge is complete

356
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:44,823
Hey, what's this?

357
00:21:44,823 --> 00:21:46,585
Why is this the top trending keyword all of a sudden?

358
00:21:46,585 --> 00:21:50,339
This is an old-time novel. Didn't you say it wasn't that popular?

359
00:21:50,339 --> 00:21:52,300
There's an article about it.

360
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:55,594
"The shocking ending of the fan-fiction novel which drew a lot of attention in 2002,

361
00:21:55,594 --> 00:21:57,575
was revealed after 15 years.

362
00:21:57,575 --> 00:22:00,529
Among original fans who are in their 40s to 50s now,

363
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:03,211
it has become a hot topic, getting an explosive number of views."

364
00:22:03,211 --> 00:22:07,086
That's crazy. It's happening now of all timings?

365
00:22:07,086 --> 00:22:09,867
I'm getting goosebumps.

368
00:22:17,466 --> 00:22:19,577
Do you still do homework with stuff like this?

369
00:22:19,577 --> 00:22:21,349
Gosh, it sucks.

370
00:22:21,349 --> 00:22:24,373
Why don't you use some cool Internet novels instead?

371
00:22:24,373 --> 00:22:26,403
Those are fun.

372

Makeup Show

376
00:23:15,443 --> 00:23:17,676
Hello, everyone. This is Nan Hui.

377
00:23:17,676 --> 00:23:20,909
Today's video will be a tutorial on makeup for dates.

378
00:23:20,909 --> 00:23:23,072
It's not too excessive but still lovely.

379
00:23:23,072 --> 00:23:26,494
I named it "Peach-flavored Candy Makeup".

380
00:23:26,494 --> 00:23:30,068
It's important to give off a delicate bare-faced impression.

381
00:23:30,068 --> 00:23:35,363
I should wear pretty makeup for my first date.

382
00:23:35,363 --> 00:23:38,175
"Makeup for dates"?

383
00:23:39,257 --> 00:23:40,618
Hold on.

384
00:23:40,618 --> 00:23:43,231
Goodness, it's her.

385
00:23:43,231 --> 00:23:46,224
How annoying.

386
00:23:46,224 --> 00:23:48,647
Still, she's pretty.

387
00:23:48,647 --> 00:23:51,669
How should I do this?

388
00:23:51,669 --> 00:23:54,612
No, this one has to come first.

389
00:23:57,525 --> 00:24:01,039
Good. My face is getting lighter.

390
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,801
How should I put this on? Like this...

391
00:24:06,284 --> 00:24:07,516
What is Gu Hui doing?

392
00:24:07,516 --> 00:24:09,337
Gu Hui!

393
00:24:09,337 --> 00:24:12,440
Leave her alone. She seems to be sensitive because of puberty.

394
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,273
Wait a second.

395
00:24:14,273 --> 00:24:16,945
Gu Hui's birthday is coming up soon.

396
00:24:16,945 --> 00:24:19,257
- You're right.
- Remember?

397
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:22,050
We forgot about her birthday once, and she made a huge deal about it.

398
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:24,933
She's a high schooler now, let's make sure we celebrate it.

399
00:24:37,936 --> 00:24:39,828
Are you all right?

400
00:24:39,828 --> 00:24:42,170
I'm sorry.

401
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:44,122
My heart flutters once every day.

402
00:24:44,122 --> 00:24:46,184
He's God Ji Hun indeed.

403
00:24:46,184 --> 00:24:47,766
Are you all right?

404
00:24:48,786 --> 00:24:52,500
I'm all right. It just grazed my head.

405
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,902
Are you really all right?

406
00:24:53,902 --> 00:24:55,743
Yes.

407
00:24:58,667 --> 00:25:00,859
Let's go eat.

408
00:25:00,859 --> 00:25:02,851
I'll buy you something delicious.

409
00:25:02,851 --> 00:25:05,324
- What do you want to have?
- Well...

410
00:25:05,324 --> 00:25:07,464
I don't know. What should we eat?

411
00:25:10,179 --> 00:25:11,969
- Let's go.
- Okay.

412
00:25:25,823 --> 00:25:28,476
Hey, look at that guy over there.

413
00:25:28,476 --> 00:25:29,888
Don't you think he's handsome?

414
00:25:29,888 --> 00:25:33,412
Gosh, he's tall too. My goodness.

415
00:25:33,412 --> 00:25:35,523
Is he a high schooler?

416
00:25:35,523 --> 00:25:36,584
Should I go talk to him?

417
00:25:36,584 --> 00:25:39,948
How dare you with that face of yours? You'll embarrass yourself.

418
00:25:39,948 --> 00:25:42,711
I wonder what his girlfriend looks like. I bet she's pretty.

419
00:25:42,711 --> 00:25:44,581
Of course.

420
00:25:53,722 --> 00:25:56,725
- What?
- Is that his girlfriend?

421
00:25:56,725 --> 00:25:59,478
- No way.
- They don't look good together.

422
00:25:59,478 --> 00:26:01,380
They don't look good together at all.

423
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,521
Look.

424
00:26:02,521 --> 00:26:05,413
What's wrong? Does your stomach hurt again?

425
00:26:05,413 --> 00:26:06,915
No.

426
00:26:06,915 --> 00:26:09,377
You think I always have a stomachache?

427
00:26:29,548 --> 00:26:30,979
Why?

428
00:26:30,979 --> 00:26:34,542
Am I eating too messily?

429
00:26:34,542 --> 00:26:36,754
You're cute even when you're eating.

430
00:26:41,939 --> 00:26:43,711
What on earth?

431
00:26:53,911 --> 00:26:55,184
What are you doing tomorrow?

432
00:26:55,184 --> 00:26:57,115
Well...

433
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:58,497
I'm going to go see oppa Eun Woo

434
00:26:58,497 --> 00:27:00,979
at his filming site with Deok Hui tomorrow.

435
00:27:00,979 --> 00:27:02,931
I won't be able to see you then.

436
00:27:02,931 --> 00:27:04,853
That's unfortunate.

437
00:27:06,505 --> 00:27:08,097
Do you want to come with us?

438
00:27:08,097 --> 00:27:09,448
Can I?

439
00:27:09,448 --> 00:27:11,249
Sure.

440
00:27:38,666 --> 00:27:40,247
It's pretty.

441
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,721
One, two, three.

442
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:05,243
Is there anything you like here?

443
00:28:05,243 --> 00:28:07,205
This one?

444
00:28:09,147 --> 00:28:11,900
No, it's not that pretty.

445
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,412
Let's go.

446
00:28:13,412 --> 00:28:15,224
It's not that pretty. Let's go.

447
00:28:15,224 --> 00:28:18,106
Come on. Hurry.

448
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:23,751
Go in first.

449
00:28:23,751 --> 00:28:25,674
No, you should go first.

450
00:28:25,674 --> 00:28:27,236
Go in first.

451
00:28:27,236 --> 00:28:29,046
Go first. I know you're going this way.

452
00:28:29,046 --> 00:28:30,569
I'll go after seeing you go in.

453
00:28:30,569 --> 00:28:33,121
Goodness. No.

454
00:28:33,121 --> 00:28:34,862
Go in first.

455
00:28:36,385 --> 00:28:38,175
Oh Gu Hui.

456
00:28:50,568 --> 00:28:53,302
It seems that you like these. Help yourself.

457
00:28:53,302 --> 00:28:55,143
Thank you.

458
00:28:57,946 --> 00:29:00,409
What do your parents do for a living?

459
00:29:00,409 --> 00:29:02,120
Are you crazy? Why would you ask such a thing?

460
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:05,503
What do you mean? It's because you two are friends.

461
00:29:06,754 --> 00:29:09,978
My father runs a small business, and my mother is a housewife.

462
00:29:09,978 --> 00:29:11,548
I see.

463
00:29:13,131 --> 00:29:17,366
You look handsome like a prince.

464
00:29:17,366 --> 00:29:19,807
I heard you're good at studying too.

465
00:29:19,807 --> 00:29:21,499
Mom.

466
00:29:21,499 --> 00:29:23,221
Please.

467
00:29:24,522 --> 00:29:26,585
Why? Stay a little longer.

468
00:29:26,585 --> 00:29:28,727
No. Let's go, Ji Hun.

469
00:29:28,727 --> 00:29:30,628
Are you taking care of your boyfriend already?

470
00:29:30,628 --> 00:29:33,009
It's not that.

471
00:29:35,613 --> 00:29:37,406
All right. Bye.

472
00:29:37,406 --> 00:29:39,557
Come by often.

473
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,540
He's handsome.

474
00:29:44,493 --> 00:29:47,135
I'm sorry. You must've been flustered because of my mom.

475
00:29:47,135 --> 00:29:49,398
It's okay.

476
00:29:49,398 --> 00:29:52,950
Your mom's so cute. I guess you take after her.

477
00:29:54,673 --> 00:29:56,304
Well...

478
00:29:57,506 --> 00:29:59,787
That's right. Where did I put it?

479
00:29:59,787 --> 00:30:01,849
What? Did you leave something behind?

480
00:30:02,059 --> 00:30:03,500
Yes.

481
00:30:09,478 --> 00:30:11,308
See you later.

482
00:30:29,498 --> 00:30:32,129
Seriously. Why did you have to do that?

483
00:30:32,129 --> 00:30:34,071
It's embarrassing.

484
00:30:34,071 --> 00:30:36,104
What did I do?

485
00:30:37,134 --> 00:30:38,786
By the way,

486
00:30:38,786 --> 00:30:40,969
does he really like you?

487
00:30:40,969 --> 00:30:42,600
I don't know. Why do you ask?

488
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,804
It's because he's too good to be your boyfriend.

489
00:30:45,804 --> 00:30:47,265
- Mom.
- Gu Hui,

490
00:30:47,265 --> 00:30:49,547
you'd better not lose him.

491
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:52,881
For you, he's like winning life's lottery.

492
00:30:52,881 --> 00:30:55,384
Mom.

00:30:55,384 --> 00:30:57,495
- Are you really my mom?
- Gosh.

494
00:30:57,495 --> 00:31:01,479
I'm telling you this because I'm your real mom, got it?

00:31:07,915 --> 00:31:10,999
Oppa, I'm here.

497
00:31:10,999 --> 00:31:12,250
Hi.

498
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:14,922
Hyeong, I'm a huge fan of yours. Can I take a picture with you?

499
00:31:14,922 --> 00:31:18,775
Why are you trying to butt in when you're here thanks to me?

500
00:31:19,758 --> 00:31:23,211
You must be Ji Hun. I heard a lot about you.

00:31:37,326 --> 00:31:40,308
I didn't know I'd see you here. It feels like we're destined to meet.

503
00:31:40,308 --> 00:31:43,111
Seonbae Yu Ra seems to be interested in Ji Hun, don't you think?

504
00:31:43,111 --> 00:31:44,973
I have some additional shooting. I have to go now.

505
00:31:44,973 --> 00:31:46,414
I guess you have to go alone today.

506
00:31:46,414 --> 00:31:48,666
- I'll get going now.
- Wake up.

507
00:31:48,666 --> 00:31:51,658
You won't be able to keep Ji Hun away from Yu Ra this way.

508
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:54,232
- Hey, this is bad.
- No way.

509
00:31:54,232 --> 00:31:56,044
Is this really Ji Hun?
