Episode 4

9
00:00:33,243 --> 00:00:37,708
That's why Ye Ri didn't react much when Yamete was in trouble.

10
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:40,370
Yamete had nothing to do with it.

11
00:00:41,501 --> 00:00:43,993
What should I do now?

12
00:00:43,993 --> 00:00:46,255
Can I send it again?

13
00:00:52,101 --> 00:00:54,014
Transmission error

14
00:00:55,265 --> 00:00:56,727
Uh? What's this?

15
00:00:58,357 --> 00:01:01,841
What's wrong with this? Is it because I used it already?

16
00:01:04,234 --> 00:01:05,995
I'm an idiot.

17
00:01:05,995 --> 00:01:08,600
I should've thought a little more before sending it.

18
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:11,920
I'm such an idiot.

19
00:01:13,703 --> 00:01:14,874
Notice

20
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:17,417
We're accepting applications from students interested in writing for a national writing competition.

21
00:01:17,417 --> 00:01:19,169
One of the applicants will be selected and awarded a 1 million won [about 885 $] scholarship.

22
00:01:19,169 --> 00:01:20,671
The results will be announced individually

23
00:01:20,671 --> 00:01:23,633
I thought Ye Ri was going to participate in that contest.

24
00:01:23,633 --> 00:01:27,598
Right, but why are they selecting another student?

25
00:01:27,598 --> 00:01:29,850
I knew this would happen.

26
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:32,471
She was so arrogant because Mr. Kim doted on her.

27
00:01:32,471 --> 00:01:34,724
To be honest, I didn't get why she made it to begin with.

28
00:01:34,724 --> 00:01:38,589
Come on, girls, don't be like this. Ye Ri must be struggling so much now.

29
00:01:38,589 --> 00:01:42,012
All her effort has turned to nothing.

30
00:01:42,012 --> 00:01:44,043
Are you all right, Ye Ri?

31
00:01:48,067 --> 00:01:51,140
Did you just see how they attacked her sarcastically?

32
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,683
Even her eyes look foxy.

33
00:01:52,683 --> 00:01:55,190
How dare she get in Mr. Kim's car?

34
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:57,430
She got in his car? Why?

35
00:01:57,457 --> 00:02:01,090
I don't know. She probably flirted again to get a ride.

36
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:04,635
Maybe that's how she's got selected for the contest.

37
00:02:04,635 --> 00:02:06,425
No way.

38
00:02:06,425 --> 00:02:09,840
She could've tried to flirt, but Teacher Yi Jeong isn't the person to be swayed by that.

39
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,161
Of course, he has high standards.

40
00:02:14,975 --> 00:02:18,498
Girls, I think you're crossing the line.

41
00:02:18,498 --> 00:02:20,710
- What do you mean?
- You were just bad-mouthing Ye Ri.

42
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:24,674
What? We did? When did we bad-mouth her?

43
00:02:24,674 --> 00:02:27,387
You don't even know what's going on.

44
00:02:27,387 --> 00:02:29,199
Go to apologize to Ye Ri now.

45
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:30,761
Apologize?

46
00:02:30,761 --> 00:02:32,031
Listen.

47
00:02:32,031 --> 00:02:34,464
Even Ye Ri isn't saying anything, so who are you to tell us to apologize?

48
00:02:34,464 --> 00:02:36,456
Teacher Kim Yi Jeong...

49
00:02:37,868 --> 00:02:42,832
He's... he's not the type of person you think he is.

50
00:02:42,832 --> 00:02:44,944
He's totally two-faced.

51
00:02:44,944 --> 00:02:49,268
How dare you say that about him? You go apologize to him.

52
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,202
This is frustrating, but I can't say anything more.

53
00:02:53,202 --> 00:02:56,427
Just don't butt in if you know nothing.

54
00:02:56,427 --> 00:02:57,957
He's a scumbag...

55
00:02:57,957 --> 00:02:59,980
Shut up.

56
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,210
How dare you say that?

57
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:03,193
Hey!

58
00:03:03,193 --> 00:03:04,754
Let me go.

59
00:03:04,754 --> 00:03:07,617
You think I put up with you because I was scared of you?

60
00:03:07,617 --> 00:03:09,568
- Why you...
- What?

61
00:03:09,568 --> 00:03:10,801
You!

62
00:03:10,801 --> 00:03:12,032
Let this go!

63
00:03:12,032 --> 00:03:15,555
- Let go first!
- What's wrong with you?

64
00:03:15,555 --> 00:03:17,356
- Goodness!
- The teacher is coming!

65
00:03:17,356 --> 00:03:18,939
- Let go!
- The teacher is coming!

66
00:03:18,939 --> 00:03:20,190
- Let go!
- The teacher is coming!

67
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,221
- Hey!
- Hey!

68
00:03:22,221 --> 00:03:23,783
You little brat!

69
00:03:23,783 --> 00:03:25,005
Hey!

70
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:27,047
- Let go!
- The teacher is coming!

71
00:03:27,047 --> 00:03:31,071
Why do I have to get in this mess because of this crazy wench?

72
00:03:31,071 --> 00:03:34,574
My image is ruined because of you. How are you going to take responsibility?

73
00:03:34,574 --> 00:03:36,445
Tell me, Ho Gu Hui.

74
00:03:37,727 --> 00:03:40,159
Who do you think you're glaring at? Lower your eyes.

75
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,562
Just don't freak out later.

76
00:03:42,562 --> 00:03:44,835
- You crazy little...
- What?

77
00:03:44,835 --> 00:03:48,027
- Goodness.
- Did you girls have lunch?

78
00:03:56,996 --> 00:03:59,407
So what you're saying is...

79
00:04:01,331 --> 00:04:04,384
Teacher Kim and Ye Ri...

80
00:04:04,384 --> 00:04:08,658
So the bad guy in the rumor is Teacher Kim?

81
00:04:08,658 --> 00:04:12,812
Right. I clearly saw it with my own eyes.

82
00:04:12,812 --> 00:04:16,295
He kicked Ye Ri out right away because she wasn't obedient.

83
00:04:17,516 --> 00:04:20,269
Can't you think of any good ideas?

84
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:23,573
Show me what you can do.

85
00:04:23,573 --> 00:04:25,875
Reporting won't do any good.

86
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:27,677
It'll only harm Ye Ri.

87
00:04:27,677 --> 00:04:29,878
No one's going to believe us.

88
00:04:29,878 --> 00:04:34,453
Right? It'll only make us look crazy.

89
00:04:34,453 --> 00:04:36,815
It's so hard.

90
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,411
How about we try this?

91
00:04:42,411 --> 00:04:44,153
What?

92
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:53,052
You're a genius.

93
00:04:53,052 --> 00:04:56,366
Can we do a good job though?

94
00:04:56,366 --> 00:04:59,437
We can do it. Don't worry.

95
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:29,900
Right. You made the right choice.

96
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:33,823
Reporting me will only harm you.

97
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:37,275
Do you think people will take your side?

98
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:45,503
You're only going to be criticized as a girl who flirts with men.

99
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:51,480
If you do as I tell you,

100
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,663
I'll even get you into college.

101
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:04,201
All right. Come closer.

102
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:10,499
Give me your hand.

103
00:06:10,499 --> 00:06:12,141
What?

104
00:06:13,632 --> 00:06:15,295
Hey! You...

105
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:17,406
Who are you?

106
00:06:17,406 --> 00:06:19,930
What's wrong? Are you surprised

107
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:21,590
because I wasn't the one you've had in mind?

108
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,834
Well, why...

109
00:06:23,834 --> 00:06:26,845
Why are you here?

110
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:31,010
I sent you the message.

111
00:06:32,401 --> 00:06:35,065
Teacher Kim, I'm sorry.

112
00:06:35,065 --> 00:06:37,856
I'll do everything you tell me to. I'll wait in the special activities room.

113
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,491
Your joke went too far.

114
00:06:42,491 --> 00:06:45,504
- This is beyond what I can tolerate—
- Then don't tolerate.

115
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:48,767
I'm doing this because I can't tolerate you, too.

116
00:06:48,767 --> 00:06:50,468
What?

117
00:06:59,508 --> 00:07:01,579
The video has been deleted

118
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:11,181
I'll let it slide just this once.

119
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:14,093
Don't ever pull such a prank on me again.

120
00:07:14,093 --> 00:07:16,736
Don't think about telling this to other people either.

121
00:07:18,317 --> 00:07:21,261
No one will believe you even if you tell them anyway.

122
00:07:21,261 --> 00:07:23,051
Okay?

123
00:07:33,963 --> 00:07:36,126
Did you get that?

124
00:07:36,126 --> 00:07:38,067
Yes, I got everything.

125
00:07:38,067 --> 00:07:41,340
- Well, why... Why are you here? 
- Good job.

126
00:07:42,551 --> 00:07:44,414
Gosh, I was so nervous.

127
00:07:44,414 --> 00:07:46,525
- I got goosebumps, seriously.
- My goodness.

128
00:07:46,525 --> 00:07:47,977
Gosh, it's hot.

129
00:07:47,977 --> 00:07:49,728
- Seriously.
- That evil bastard.

130
00:07:49,728 --> 00:07:51,460
You did a great job!

131
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,631
Your joke went too far.

132
00:08:02,902 --> 00:08:06,424
Do you think people will take your side?

133
00:08:07,366 --> 00:08:11,750
You're only going to be criticized as a girl who flirts with men.

134
00:08:13,163 --> 00:08:16,525
If you do as I tell you,

135
00:08:16,525 --> 00:08:20,070
I'll even get you into college.

136
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,911
- Can you believe it?
- I know, right?

137
00:08:21,911 --> 00:08:24,604
- Seriously...
- How could he?

138
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:25,895
He's unbelievable.

139
00:08:25,895 --> 00:08:27,477
Aren't you getting in?

140
00:08:27,477 --> 00:08:29,317
Gosh.

141
00:08:33,353 --> 00:08:35,524
Doors are closing.

142
00:08:38,027 --> 00:08:39,168
Hello.

143
00:08:39,168 --> 00:08:42,111
Let's just go. That's Mr. Kim.

144
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:07,295
This is Teacher Kim, right?

145
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,891
It's really him.

146
00:09:11,891 --> 00:09:15,504
I can tell right away by his face and voice.

147
00:09:15,504 --> 00:09:18,768
This must be fabricated. How can this be Teacher Kim?

148
00:09:18,768 --> 00:09:20,038
Right?

149
00:09:20,038 --> 00:09:23,092
But the video captured him too well for it to be fake.

150
00:09:23,092 --> 00:09:25,634
I had no idea he'd do such a thing.

151
00:09:25,634 --> 00:09:28,336
I know, right?

152
00:09:28,336 --> 00:09:30,160
Who is that girl by the way?

153
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,103
- This is so satisfying.
- Was there a girl like her in our school?

154
00:09:34,103 --> 00:09:35,804
Who is she?

155
00:09:49,179 --> 00:09:52,000
All right. Come closer.

156
00:09:54,012 --> 00:09:56,485
Give me your hand.

157
00:10:03,693 --> 00:10:07,116
Teacher Kim ended up getting arrested.

158
00:10:07,116 --> 00:10:11,140
Other victims reported him after the video went viral.

159
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,942
Turns out there were several students

160
00:10:13,942 --> 00:10:17,296
who were victimized in a similar way at his previous school.

161
00:10:17,296 --> 00:10:18,997
Is that right?

162
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:23,322
Do you think Ye Ri reported him too?

163
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:26,545
I don't know, but I guess she did,

164
00:10:26,545 --> 00:10:29,097
judging by her bright face.

165
00:10:37,055 --> 00:10:38,356
Ye Ri.

166
00:10:39,479 --> 00:10:40,939
How did the contest go?

167
00:10:40,939 --> 00:10:43,603
I got selected among the applicants.

168
00:10:43,603 --> 00:10:45,674
So I'm still participating in the writing contest.

169
00:10:45,674 --> 00:10:48,207
I see. I knew it.

170
00:10:48,207 --> 00:10:51,660
I guess it's better for you this way.

171
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:55,145
Otherwise, people would talk this and that about you because of Teacher Kim.

172
00:10:55,145 --> 00:10:57,576
Gu Hui.

173
00:10:57,576 --> 00:10:59,187
Thank you.

174
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:01,571
For what?

175
00:11:01,571 --> 00:11:04,023
For taking my side back then.

176
00:11:04,023 --> 00:11:08,878
Oh, that. It's not even a big deal.

177
00:11:08,878 --> 00:11:10,660
It's nothing.

178
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:13,012
Wait, Ga Eun.

179
00:11:13,012 --> 00:11:15,153
Apologize to Ye Ri already.

180
00:11:16,345 --> 00:11:17,646
Ye Ri,

181
00:11:18,727 --> 00:11:20,348
I'm sorry.

182
00:11:24,813 --> 00:11:27,297
This is why I told you so many times

183
00:11:27,297 --> 00:11:30,029
that you should look at personality more than appearance in men.

184
00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:34,103
What are you saying? You lack in both personality and appearance, so get lost.

185
00:11:37,287 --> 00:11:38,457
Bye, girls.

186
00:11:38,457 --> 00:11:39,998
Bye.

187
00:11:43,293 --> 00:11:45,073
We should go, too.

188
00:11:54,304 --> 00:11:56,614
The girl in that video...

189
00:11:57,807 --> 00:11:59,187
It was you, wasn't it?

190
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:02,140
How did you know?

191
00:12:06,985 --> 00:12:09,447
She was tiny just like you.

192
00:12:11,109 --> 00:12:14,482
Forget about it. I don't know how I pulled it off then.

193
00:12:15,614 --> 00:12:17,135
Why?

194
00:12:21,451 --> 00:12:23,511
I'll remember it forever.

195
00:12:24,623 --> 00:12:26,585
You were really cool.

196
00:12:32,842 --> 00:12:35,073
Right. I need to give you something.

197
00:12:35,073 --> 00:12:36,805
Wait here.

198
00:12:47,936 --> 00:12:49,668
It's your necktie.

199
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:51,570
I'm sorry for giving it back so late.

200
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,342
It's okay.

201
00:12:53,342 --> 00:12:55,704
I should've given it back earlier,

202
00:12:55,704 --> 00:12:58,537
but you know, things were a little hectic.

203
00:12:58,537 --> 00:13:02,340
And I put in a small gift with it.

204
00:13:03,542 --> 00:13:05,943
Open it later.

205
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,400
How cute.

206
00:13:18,717 --> 00:13:21,059
Coupon

207
00:13:28,317 --> 00:13:30,219
Are you ready?

208
00:13:30,219 --> 00:13:33,452
- All right. In position.
- Okay.

209
00:13:35,775 --> 00:13:37,956
This should be in position too.

210
00:13:39,659 --> 00:13:41,999
All right. Five seconds left.

211
00:13:44,373 --> 00:13:46,566
- Go!
- Go!

212
00:13:46,566 --> 00:13:47,937
Astro

213
00:13:47,937 --> 00:13:49,127
- Astro.
- More!

214
00:13:49,127 --> 00:13:50,289
More!

215
00:13:50,289 --> 00:13:52,942
They must top the search keyword list as soon as they release their album.

216
00:13:52,942 --> 00:13:55,494
Type more! Search their names with every device you have!

217
00:13:55,494 --> 00:13:57,656
Cha Eun Woo...

218
00:13:57,656 --> 00:14:00,789
- Use the F5 hotkey.
- All right.

219
00:14:00,789 --> 00:14:02,081
What should I search?

220
00:14:02,081 --> 00:14:03,583
- Anything about them. Astro!
- Okay.

221
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:04,804
They're the best.

222
00:14:04,804 --> 00:14:07,316
Astro is the best.

223
00:14:07,316 --> 00:14:09,709
More!

224
00:14:09,709 --> 00:14:12,340
He's so cool!

225
00:14:12,481 --> 00:14:13,993
Eun Woo is

226
00:14:13,993 --> 00:14:16,274
so cool.

227
00:14:16,274 --> 00:14:18,517
Oh, right. Do you like soy sauce marinated crabs?

228
00:14:18,517 --> 00:14:20,118
What? Why do you ask?

229
00:14:20,118 --> 00:14:23,241
I saw it earlier. Your mom is great.

230
00:14:23,241 --> 00:14:25,755
- She was making soy sauce marinated crabs.
 - It's for my baby.

231
00:14:25,755 --> 00:14:27,477
This late at night.

232
00:14:27,477 --> 00:14:30,510
That's not for me. It's for Eun Woo.

233
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:32,290
What?

234
00:14:33,713 --> 00:14:36,795
Play the entire song, not just the preview.

235
00:14:36,795 --> 00:14:38,537
Can't you do a better job with streaming?

236
00:14:38,537 --> 00:14:39,839
All right. Yes ma'am.

237
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,071
It's done.

238
00:14:42,071 --> 00:14:43,973
When you go to work tomorrow morning,

239
00:14:43,973 --> 00:14:45,283
have this delivered by courier.

240
00:14:45,283 --> 00:14:46,976
Use express courier so it won't spoil.

241
00:14:46,976 --> 00:14:48,897
- Express, all right.
- The address is written here.

242
00:14:48,897 --> 00:14:50,459
Yes.

243
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:53,932
My baby Eun Woo will be so happy to eat this.

244
00:14:55,104 --> 00:14:56,675
Aigoo!

245
00:14:56,675 --> 00:14:59,718
These two women go nuts whenever Asphalt or whatever makes a comeback.

246
00:14:59,718 --> 00:15:03,112
It's driving me crazy.

247
00:15:03,112 --> 00:15:04,894
Their name is Astro.

248
00:15:04,894 --> 00:15:06,666
It's Astro, not Asphalt.

249
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:07,767
You idiot.

250
00:15:07,767 --> 00:15:08,827
- A.
- A.

251
00:15:08,827 --> 00:15:09,788
- S.
- S.

252
00:15:09,788 --> 00:15:10,709
- T.
- T.

253
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:11,621
- Ro.
- Ro.

254
00:15:11,621 --> 00:15:13,111
- Astro.
- Astro.

255
00:15:13,111 --> 00:15:14,943
- So what should you be doing now?
- Astro.

256
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,776
- Streaming.
- Oh, right.

257
00:15:16,776 --> 00:15:18,547
- Do it already.
- All right. Streaming.

258
00:15:18,547 --> 00:15:20,278
I'll just...

259
00:15:22,131 --> 00:15:23,201
- Streaming.
- Streaming.

260
00:15:23,201 --> 00:15:24,433
- All right.
- Right.

261
00:15:24,433 --> 00:15:26,416
Play all songs.

262
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:30,689
Did you watch the music video yesterday? I stayed up all night watching it.

263
00:15:30,689 --> 00:15:33,462
Check this out. I captured the scenes by frame.

264
00:15:33,462 --> 00:15:35,294
Awesome.

265
00:15:35,294 --> 00:15:37,135
I love them so much.

266
00:15:37,135 --> 00:15:39,388
Ta-da, I got JinJin's picture.

267
00:15:39,388 --> 00:15:41,831
Ta-da, mine is MJ's.

268
00:15:41,831 --> 00:15:44,002
Jeong Deok Hui, what about you?

269
00:15:45,284 --> 00:15:46,615
You only have one each?

270
00:15:46,615 --> 00:15:49,878
I bought ten albums and got so many pictures of Oppa Eun Woo.

271
00:15:49,878 --> 00:15:51,830
Goodness!

272
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:54,112
You're the best!

273
00:15:54,112 --> 00:15:57,366
To be honest, he's just average-looking.

274
00:15:57,366 --> 00:16:00,017
I think I'm better. Don't you agree?

275
00:16:04,262 --> 00:16:05,455
Sorry.

276
00:16:05,455 --> 00:16:06,765
Exterminate him.

277
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:08,647
Are you out of your mind?

278
00:16:08,647 --> 00:16:09,929
Sorry.

279
00:16:09,929 --> 00:16:11,681
- You're crazy!
- How dare you say that?

280
00:16:11,681 --> 00:16:14,934
Your dead-fish eyes can't be compared to his deep eyes!

281
00:16:14,934 --> 00:16:16,886
- You idiot!
- How dare you?

282
00:16:16,886 --> 00:16:18,487
I'll make you shut up!

283
00:16:18,487 --> 00:16:21,259
What a scene.

284
00:16:21,259 --> 00:16:23,031
Astro Fan Tour

285
00:16:23,943 --> 00:16:26,615
Eun Woo set: half fried, half seasoned, one soy sauce chicken.

286
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:32,811
This is the fried chicken restaurant that was added to the fan tour list, right?

287
00:16:32,811 --> 00:16:34,663
- It was posted on Oppa Eun Woo's Instagram.
- Really?

288
00:16:34,663 --> 00:16:36,335
Don't stop me. I'll buy ten fried chickens.

289
00:16:36,335 --> 00:16:37,556
Let's go!

290
00:16:37,556 --> 00:16:39,477
Excuse me.

291
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,092
Will he be here today?

292
00:16:43,092 --> 00:16:44,633
- Oh my god.
- I always check his Instagram

293
00:16:44,633 --> 00:16:47,346
and it always says that he comes here. Do you think he'll really be here?

294
00:16:47,346 --> 00:16:49,137
- I think he will this time.
- Yes.

295
00:16:49,137 --> 00:16:50,600
I'm really excited he's here.

296
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,321
They're foreigners.

297
00:16:53,352 --> 00:16:56,255
- I'll leave it up to you.
- Can't you take an order in English when you're a high school student?

298
00:16:56,255 --> 00:16:58,658
Oh my god. He'll be like sexy...

299
00:16:58,658 --> 00:17:01,411
- Hi, where are you from?
- No.

300
00:17:01,411 --> 00:17:03,783
I'm from New York.

301
00:17:03,783 --> 00:17:07,636
Gosh, my son is good at speaking in English too.

302
00:17:07,636 --> 00:17:09,488
You're so handsome.

303
00:17:09,488 --> 00:17:12,190
Can we take a picture together?

304
00:17:13,993 --> 00:17:16,695
Even foreigners recognize handsome men.

305
00:17:16,695 --> 00:17:18,397
Thank you.

306
00:17:18,397 --> 00:17:22,200
It looks like my face will be exposed as well.

307
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,781
Okay.

308
00:17:25,004 --> 00:17:27,245
One, two, three.

309
00:17:27,245 --> 00:17:29,557
Thank you.

310
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,351
- Goodness.
- Gosh.

311
00:17:35,313 --> 00:17:36,686
My son.

312
00:17:36,686 --> 00:17:39,067
- Goodness, seriously.
- Gosh.

313
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:42,191
What was that?

314
00:17:42,191 --> 00:17:46,023
All right. The food is on its way.

315
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,614
Forget about the Eun Woo Set.

316
00:18:04,614 --> 00:18:06,516
I can't eat anymore.

317
00:18:06,516 --> 00:18:09,048
Right. Stop eating now.

318
00:18:09,048 --> 00:18:12,321
You've been eating fried chicken for days.

319
00:18:14,392 --> 00:18:16,884
He only ordered delivery...

320
00:18:17,977 --> 00:18:20,008
and didn't visit this place, right?

321
00:18:20,008 --> 00:18:21,460
That's right.

322
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:24,783
He won't come even if you hang around this place all day long.

323
00:18:28,196 --> 00:18:30,768
I want to see him.

324
00:18:32,321 --> 00:18:35,003
He's too busy to come these days,

325
00:18:35,003 --> 00:18:37,265
so technically, I'm not lying.

326
00:18:37,265 --> 00:18:39,578
Sorry, Deok Hee.

327
00:18:42,752 --> 00:18:44,823
"Please don't push me".

328
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:47,335
"Please don't push me."
(In Japanese)

329
00:18:48,297 --> 00:18:51,991
Right. No matter how busy you are as an avid fan of theirs,

330
00:18:51,991 --> 00:18:53,993
you have to study from time to time.

331
00:18:53,993 --> 00:18:56,265
- Why are you studying Japanese though?
- Oppa Eun Woo is holding a concert

332
00:18:56,265 --> 00:18:59,628
in Japan this summer. I have to get prepared to go with him.

333
00:18:59,628 --> 00:19:01,479
"Please don't push me."

334
00:19:01,479 --> 00:19:02,651
It means, don't push me.

335
00:19:02,651 --> 00:19:04,774
"Please don't touch me."

336
00:19:04,774 --> 00:19:06,154
It means, don't touch me.

337
00:19:06,154 --> 00:19:07,235
- I see.
- Okay.

338
00:19:07,235 --> 00:19:09,738
You must be really busy these days.

339
00:19:09,738 --> 00:19:11,710
Of course, I am.

340
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:14,573
I wish I had at least ten bodies.

341
00:19:14,573 --> 00:19:17,977
I pulled off something again yesterday.

342
00:19:17,977 --> 00:19:21,419
Everyone, their promotions in Korea are expected to be short this time,

343
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:24,083
so we must organize things systematically.

344
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:27,025
And we have to buy gifts for each member.

345
00:19:27,025 --> 00:19:28,977
Does anyone have an idea?

346
00:19:28,977 --> 00:19:31,990
What about limited-edition sneakers?

347
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:34,203
During promotion, their health condition is the most important.

348
00:19:34,203 --> 00:19:36,414
Red ginseng extracts could be a good idea.

349
00:19:36,414 --> 00:19:37,847
Go on.

350
00:19:37,847 --> 00:19:39,688
There is a lot of micro dust these days.

351
00:19:39,688 --> 00:19:42,230
How about we send them a high-end air purifier

352
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:44,922
and a clothing refresher?

353
00:19:48,357 --> 00:19:50,760
Everyone, only the last issue remains.

354
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,353
"Eun Woo's Wifey" from Mapo Gu, known for her craftsmanship,

355
00:19:54,353 --> 00:19:57,266
has prepared something special this time as well.

356
00:19:57,266 --> 00:20:00,188
It's 100 percent handmade.

357
00:20:00,188 --> 00:20:02,161
It's a stuffed Eun Woo doll.

358
00:20:02,161 --> 00:20:03,332
Ta-da!

359
00:20:04,793 --> 00:20:06,965
- It's so pretty.
- It's 20,000 won per unit.

360
00:20:06,965 --> 00:20:09,088
There are only ten dolls for sale. Who wants them?

361
00:20:09,088 --> 00:20:11,129
- Me!
- Me!

362
00:20:11,129 --> 00:20:12,510
Line up, please.

363
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:15,053
- Can I touch it?
- No.

364
00:20:15,053 --> 00:20:16,725
- It's so pretty.
- Come and check it out.

365
00:20:16,725 --> 00:20:17,847
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

366
00:20:17,847 --> 00:20:19,178
- Here.
- Thank you.

367
00:20:19,178 --> 00:20:20,639
Thank you.

368
00:20:20,639 --> 00:20:22,710
- Here.
- Thank you.

369
00:20:23,772 --> 00:20:26,123
- Thank you.
- It's so pretty.

370
00:20:31,861 --> 00:20:35,364
You're so cute. I love you.
(In Japanese)

371
00:20:36,745 --> 00:20:40,159
I'm getting more and more scared of you.

372
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,540
I might have to sell my organs

373
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:45,654
if I want to go to their Asia tour during vacation.

374
00:20:45,654 --> 00:20:48,107
Oh my goodness. Eun Woo got involved in a scandal!

375
00:20:48,107 --> 00:20:49,507
Daebak, check this out!

376
00:20:49,507 --> 00:20:50,709
- What?
- What scandal?

377
00:20:50,709 --> 00:20:52,561
Daebak. Read this.

378
00:20:52,561 --> 00:20:54,984
- Is this for real?
- "Shock! Member of popular idol group

379
00:20:54,984 --> 00:20:57,165
had late night date with a high school girl."

380
00:20:57,165 --> 00:20:58,577
"Suspected to be dating a minor"?

381
00:20:58,577 --> 00:21:01,069
Guys, look at the pictures.

382
00:21:01,069 --> 00:21:03,392
He's hugging her.

383
00:21:03,392 --> 00:21:04,853
Are you sure he's Cha Eun Woo?

384
00:21:04,853 --> 00:21:06,575
Can't you tell? It's obviously him.

385
00:21:06,575 --> 00:21:08,316
By the way, isn't this our school uniform?

386
00:21:08,397 --> 00:21:09,968
- What?
- Look.

387
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:11,469
Daebak.

388
00:21:11,469 --> 00:21:14,763
You're right. Who is this wench?

389
00:21:14,763 --> 00:21:16,765
These pictures...

390
00:21:16,765 --> 00:21:18,536
No way.

391
00:21:18,536 --> 00:21:21,169
Make sure you tell me when something comes up.

392
00:21:21,169 --> 00:21:24,142
Okay. Thanks.

393
00:21:40,219 --> 00:21:42,211
This is a conspiracy.

394
00:21:42,211 --> 00:21:44,683
Dispatch* would've revealed it first if it was real.
(Korean news and gossip magazine)

395
00:21:44,683 --> 00:21:48,067
These pictures were taken by an amateur. Something's fishy.

396
00:21:48,067 --> 00:21:50,629
She's wearing our school uniform.

397
00:21:50,629 --> 00:21:52,922
Right. She could be one of them.

398
00:21:52,922 --> 00:21:54,944
I'll find this girl and give her a lesson.

399
00:21:54,944 --> 00:21:57,054
I'll protect my oppa.

400
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:08,917
Handsome idol, Cha Eun Woo, on secret date with a high school girl.

401
00:22:16,344 --> 00:22:17,716
Hello?

402
00:22:17,716 --> 00:22:20,659
Gu Hui, is everything all right?

403
00:22:20,659 --> 00:22:23,272
Oppa, what about you? How are you doing?

404
00:22:23,272 --> 00:22:26,053
I'm all right, so don't worry.

405
00:22:28,606 --> 00:22:31,840
How can it be all right? It's getting crazy.

406
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,012
It's not a big deal.

407
00:22:34,012 --> 00:22:37,554
It'll quiet down after a small fuss.

408
00:22:39,157 --> 00:22:40,749
Oppa...

409
00:22:40,749 --> 00:22:44,302
I'm so sorry. It's all my fault.

410
00:22:44,302 --> 00:22:46,214
Should I write a post on the Internet?

411
00:22:46,214 --> 00:22:48,606
Don't even think about doing such a thing.

412
00:22:48,606 --> 00:22:50,668
I'll take care of it myself,

413
00:22:50,668 --> 00:22:54,131
so act like you don't know anything until the end, okay?

414
00:22:56,085 --> 00:22:58,576
Okay.

415
00:22:58,576 --> 00:23:01,650
Okay. Good night.

416
00:23:14,313 --> 00:23:15,443
Yes.

417
00:23:16,315 --> 00:23:19,258
Yes, Reporter Park.

418
00:23:19,258 --> 00:23:21,810
How could you release an article

419
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:24,473
about something that hasn't been confirmed to be true?

420
00:23:24,473 --> 00:23:26,515
Delete it.

421
00:23:26,515 --> 00:23:30,769
Think about how we've been cooperating with you.

422
00:23:30,769 --> 00:23:34,762
Yes, please do that. Bye.

423
00:23:37,086 --> 00:23:40,239
Don't go to your dorm and stay here for the time being.

424
00:23:40,239 --> 00:23:41,809
Who's she?

425
00:23:44,182 --> 00:23:47,556
You have to tell me if you want me to deal with it.

426
00:23:47,556 --> 00:23:50,528
Hyeong, can't you trust me?

427
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,592
- It's not what you think.
- Then who is she?

428
00:23:54,592 --> 00:23:56,645
Call her in and do a press interview or something.

429
00:23:56,645 --> 00:24:00,889
That's not an option. Whatever I say at this point, it will cause a ruckus.

430
00:24:00,889 --> 00:24:03,662
Let's go according to our schedule.

431
00:24:03,662 --> 00:24:05,074
I'll take care of it.

432
00:24:05,074 --> 00:24:08,267
A tiny tinderbox could burn down the entire house.

433
00:24:08,267 --> 00:24:11,539
The other members will be in trouble because of you.

434
00:24:11,539 --> 00:24:13,582
Who on earth is she?

435
00:24:14,542 --> 00:24:16,525
I must not reveal who she is.

436
00:24:16,525 --> 00:24:19,206
I don't know what will happen to her if I do.

437
00:24:26,345 --> 00:24:27,596
Bye.

438
00:24:27,596 --> 00:24:29,678
- Bye.
- See you.

439

Now that you sang for me, I don't feel sick anymore.

Really? Ajumma, I'm going to marry Oppa Eun Woo,

444

so I'll come and sing for you every day.

Really?

I'll be so happy if you become my daughter-in-law.

I'll give you a massage before Oppa Eun Woo comes, so you should recover soon.

All right, then.

Aigoo, that feels so good.

450
00:25:18,927 --> 00:25:20,978
How nice.

451
00:25:21,859 --> 00:25:24,193
You're good at massaging. It feels good.

Oppa Eun Woo.

455
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:44,132
- Gu Hui.
- I brought an umbrella for you.

456
00:25:44,132 --> 00:25:46,425
Your mom can't come because she's sick.

457
00:25:46,425 --> 00:25:48,826
Thank you, Gu Hui. Let's go.

458
00:26:08,237 --> 00:26:09,678
Thank you.

459
00:26:09,678 --> 00:26:11,809
The manager asked me

460
00:26:11,809 --> 00:26:14,132
to feed you something.

461
00:26:14,132 --> 00:26:16,384
Do you need anything else?

462
00:26:16,384 --> 00:26:18,497
I'm all right.

463
00:26:18,497 --> 00:26:20,128
Isn't it tough practicing these days?

464
00:26:20,128 --> 00:26:21,710
Like always.

465
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:25,033
Just worry about yourself, and take care of your health.

Bye.

468
00:26:47,025 --> 00:26:49,316
I think it's somewhere around here.

469
00:26:51,199 --> 00:26:53,322
What?

470
00:26:53,322 --> 00:26:56,753
Who ordered fried chicken in this large park?

471
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:14,743
What are you doing?

472
00:27:14,743 --> 00:27:16,774
What do you mean? We're waiting for our delivery.

473
00:27:16,774 --> 00:27:21,838
So there was a reason why you said you craved fried chicken all of a sudden.

474
00:27:23,602 --> 00:27:26,744
You're slacking off while I'm working my butt off.

475
00:27:26,744 --> 00:27:28,306
Here.

476
00:27:28,306 --> 00:27:32,281
It's originally 34,000 won,

477
00:27:32,281 --> 00:27:35,364
but with the coupon, it's 17,000 won.

478
00:27:35,364 --> 00:27:39,457
Take a break. He ordered two so you could join us.

479
00:27:39,457 --> 00:27:40,858
Eat before you go.

480
00:27:40,858 --> 00:27:44,132
Don't do this. I need to go.

481
00:28:01,269 --> 00:28:03,040
You're sloppy.

482
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:36,053
Deok Hui, it's hard for me because my hands are slow.

483
00:28:36,053 --> 00:28:38,706
You have to succeed, no matter what.

484
00:28:38,706 --> 00:28:41,559
Mom, I'm so nervous. What if I fail right away?

485
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:44,583
No, you can do it because you're my girl.

486
00:28:44,583 --> 00:28:47,064
Make consecutive attempts so that you can secure my ticket too.

487
00:28:47,064 --> 00:28:51,699
If you succeed, I'll raise your allowance by 100 percent, all right?

488
00:28:57,155 --> 00:28:58,786
Come on.

489
00:28:58,786 --> 00:29:00,258
Get ready.

490
00:29:00,258 --> 00:29:02,811
- All right.
- Five, four,

491
00:29:02,911 --> 00:29:05,824
- three, two, one.
- Three, two, one.

492
00:29:05,824 --> 00:29:07,676
Gosh! I can't get in!

493
00:29:07,676 --> 00:29:09,497
Darn it! I can't access!

494
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:12,140
Hurry! Try again.

495
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,701
- Gosh, I can't get in!
- No!

496
00:29:13,701 --> 00:29:15,473
Come on.

497
00:29:23,722 --> 00:29:24,822
I see the grapes.

498
00:29:24,822 --> 00:29:26,123
Grapes (empty seats)

499
00:29:26,123 --> 00:29:27,315
Hurry.

500
00:29:27,315 --> 00:29:28,937
Wait, gosh.

501
00:29:30,067 --> 00:29:32,729
- It's already taken.
- What?

502
00:29:33,982 --> 00:29:35,912
Yes!

503
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:45,464
- Oh dear.
- Why did it have to be so hard?

504
00:29:45,464 --> 00:29:47,044
All of them bought tickets.

505
00:29:47,044 --> 00:29:49,026
- It's—
- You useless brat.

506
00:29:49,026 --> 00:29:51,750
Why are you so slow? Did I give birth to a slug?

507
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:55,003
I made mustard leaf kimchi to feed my baby, what am I going to do with it?

508
00:29:55,003 --> 00:29:58,396
Raising your allowance? Forget it.

509
00:29:58,396 --> 00:29:59,907
Don't even bother to come home.

510
00:30:04,513 --> 00:30:06,403
Congratulations!

511
00:30:18,196 --> 00:30:20,579
Gosh, it's so tiring.

512
00:30:20,579 --> 00:30:22,529
Put it in.

513
00:30:23,661 --> 00:30:25,093
- Hello.
- Hi.

514
00:30:25,093 --> 00:30:26,435
Hello.

515
00:30:26,435 --> 00:30:27,885
- Hi.
- What's up?

516
00:30:27,885 --> 00:30:29,858
Eun Woo Set is sold out today.

517
00:30:29,858 --> 00:30:31,919
I couldn't buy the tickets for the concert.

518
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,363
It looked like my mom would beat me to a pulp,

519
00:30:34,363 --> 00:30:35,965
so I came here.

520
00:30:35,965 --> 00:30:40,448
I see. Go upstairs first. I'll come too, after I'm done with this.

521
00:30:40,448 --> 00:30:42,079
Okay.

522
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:44,281
- Bye.
- Go upstairs.

523
00:30:45,893 --> 00:30:48,085
What was she talking about?

524
00:30:48,085 --> 00:30:50,208
What tickets?

525
00:30:50,208 --> 00:30:52,349
You don't have to know.

526
00:31:05,122 --> 00:31:07,003
Who are you?

527
00:31:08,376 --> 00:31:11,218
Here, drink this.

528
00:31:18,175 --> 00:31:20,678
So you're Gu Hui's classmate, Deok Hui?

529
00:31:20,678 --> 00:31:22,491
That's right.

530
00:31:22,491 --> 00:31:24,453
Thank you for this.

531
00:31:24,453 --> 00:31:26,555
I have to head outside again.

532
00:31:26,555 --> 00:31:28,456
It must be boring to wait alone.

533
00:31:29,477 --> 00:31:31,469
Oh, hold on.

534
00:31:39,196 --> 00:31:40,738
This will help you to kill time.

535
00:31:40,738 --> 00:31:42,971
Yes, sure. Thank you.

536
00:31:42,971 --> 00:31:45,684
See you again, Orabeoni*.
(*antiquated form of "oppa")

537
00:31:45,684 --> 00:31:47,285
Bye.

538
00:31:51,289 --> 00:31:53,971
My gosh. Gu Hui is a total liar.

539
00:31:53,971 --> 00:31:57,635
She said her brother was an idiot, but he's actually really cool.

540
00:31:59,677 --> 00:32:02,269
And his abs...

541
00:32:07,345 --> 00:32:09,357
I should visit here often.

542
00:32:18,025 --> 00:32:21,809
Orabeoni Gu Jun was so cute when he was little.

543
00:32:23,111 --> 00:32:25,953
Gu Hui was quite adorable too.

544
00:32:25,953 --> 00:32:28,526
She became uglier as she grew up.

545
00:32:40,669 --> 00:32:42,419
What is this?

546
00:32:58,275 --> 00:33:00,288
~ Revenge Note 1 ~
[Preview]

547
00:33:00,288 --> 00:33:01,589
Let's share an umbrella.

548
00:33:01,589 --> 00:33:02,990
But you go in the opposite direction.

549
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:04,692
It's okay. It doesn't matter.

550
00:33:05,823 --> 00:33:07,906
I guess it's real. The video is going viral this time.

551
00:33:07,906 --> 00:33:10,619
The cue sheet got changed suddenly, so we aren't shooting today.

552
00:33:10,619 --> 00:33:13,330
I need to know who it is to do something.

553
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:15,063
Explain or take responsibility!

554
00:33:15,063 --> 00:33:17,354
Do something!
