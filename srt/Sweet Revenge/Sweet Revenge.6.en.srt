Episode 6

00:00:36,957 --> 00:00:38,418
My gosh.

10
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:41,801
Who is it?

11
00:00:50,349 --> 00:00:52,663
Deok Hui.

12
00:00:52,663 --> 00:00:54,975
What is it? What's wrong?

13
00:00:54,975 --> 00:00:56,705
What happened?

14
00:01:03,023 --> 00:01:06,465
So you ran away from home?

15
00:01:07,487 --> 00:01:10,269
I'm never going back home.

16
00:01:10,269 --> 00:01:12,983
Deok Hui, can I stay here for a few days?

17
00:01:12,983 --> 00:01:15,354
That's fine,

18
00:01:15,354 --> 00:01:18,336
but why did you run away from home?

19
00:01:27,177 --> 00:01:28,547
My goodness.

20
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:30,640
Why do you have to eat so fast?

21
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,972
Let your oppa have some. Can't you see how thin he is?

22
00:01:32,972 --> 00:01:34,704
You're really...

23
00:01:34,704 --> 00:01:36,795
Here, eat up.

24
00:01:37,807 --> 00:01:40,559
Aigoo, look how well you eat.

25
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:43,963
My baby even eats like an angel.

26
00:01:45,445 --> 00:01:47,778
You do know that my only joy in life is

27
00:01:47,778 --> 00:01:50,730
seeing your face every day, right?

28
00:01:53,242 --> 00:01:55,645
What's wrong with her? How rude.

29
00:01:55,645 --> 00:01:58,138
Gu Hui, get back here or there will be no food for you.

30
00:01:58,138 --> 00:02:01,069
- I'm not eating!
- That little...

31
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:06,286
What on earth has gotten into her all of a sudden?

32
00:02:06,286 --> 00:02:10,520
They say adolescents are a handful. She's just really making me grow old.

33
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,590
Are you hungry?

34
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,120
That's why you should've eaten when you could.

35
00:02:27,026 --> 00:02:28,739
I'm going to make some *bibimmyeon.
(*cold mixed noodles)

36
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:31,241
- Do you want some?
- No.

37
00:02:31,241 --> 00:02:33,312
- I'm full.
- Are you sure?

38
00:02:33,312 --> 00:02:34,914
I'll make just one portion then.

39
00:02:34,914 --> 00:02:39,027
- You better not try to take any later.
- Enjoy it all you want.

40
00:02:53,592 --> 00:02:56,605
That looks really good.

41
00:02:59,139 --> 00:03:01,060
Gu Hui, can I have a bite?

42
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,693
No, I already asked you before if you wanted some.

43
00:03:03,693 --> 00:03:05,395
Can I have just one bite?

44
00:03:05,395 --> 00:03:07,027
- I said no.
- I swear,

45
00:03:07,027 --> 00:03:08,947
I'll really only have one bite.

46
00:03:13,243 --> 00:03:15,134
- I'm watching you.
- Okay.

47
00:03:16,286 --> 00:03:19,038
No, that's not a bite. Take less.

48
00:03:19,038 --> 00:03:20,879
- Like this?
- Gosh.

49
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:26,756
- This is only a few strands of noodles.
- Yes.

50
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,572
You...

51
00:03:32,572 --> 00:03:35,926
You said you didn't want any!

52
00:03:35,926 --> 00:03:38,058
You're eating it all!

53
00:03:38,058 --> 00:03:41,561
My goodness. Can't you share with your brother?

54
00:03:41,561 --> 00:03:44,715
Why is someone small like you so greedy over food?

55
00:03:44,715 --> 00:03:46,605
Gu Jun, do you want me to make you another one?

56
00:03:46,605 --> 00:03:50,380
No, that was a really filling bite.

57
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:54,034
It was mine. I made it for myself!

58
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:56,115
Why did you eat the whole thing?

59
00:03:56,115 --> 00:03:59,449
Aigoo... That's nothing to scream about.

60
00:03:59,449 --> 00:04:02,420
Fine. I'll make you another one!

61
00:04:04,874 --> 00:04:06,636
Oh, my.

62
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:10,118
I can't believe that girl.

63
00:04:12,963 --> 00:04:15,095
It's not because of the bibimmyeon.

64
00:04:15,095 --> 00:04:17,627
Why do I always get treated this way?

65
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:24,364
So you ran away from home over a bowl of bibimmyeon?

66
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:25,875
No.

67
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:30,489
I'm not saying it's over the bibimmyeon. It's not about the food.

68
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:35,264
The one getting on my nerves isn't my mom.

69
00:04:35,264 --> 00:04:37,366
It's my brother.

70
00:04:37,366 --> 00:04:40,080
Why? Oppa Gu Jun

71
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,083
is tall, handsome and sweet.

72
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,454
I wish I had an oppa like him.

73
00:04:44,454 --> 00:04:47,337
He only acts normal outside of the house.

74
00:04:47,337 --> 00:04:50,741
He's a completely different person at home.

75
00:04:50,741 --> 00:04:52,342
Hey, Gu Hui,

76
00:04:53,552 --> 00:04:54,995
take this.

77
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:57,356
What's this?

78
00:04:57,356 --> 00:04:58,958
This is expensive.

79
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:01,190
What's the occasion? Is this really for me?

80
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,853
Yes, eat up.

81
00:05:02,853 --> 00:05:05,444
I love you, Gu Jun.

82
00:05:05,444 --> 00:05:08,809
But eat it and stay in your room.

83
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,630
Why?

84
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,482
My friends are coming over later,

85
00:05:12,482 --> 00:05:15,343
and it's embarrassing because you're ugly.

86
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:19,890
That's hilarious.

87
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:23,131
Your brother really knows how to lay down the facts.

88
00:05:25,495 --> 00:05:29,688
I can't believe this. How could my baby get disqualified?

89
00:05:29,688 --> 00:05:31,682
My oppa must've gotten disqualified.

90
00:05:31,682 --> 00:05:33,242
You have an oppa?

91
00:05:33,242 --> 00:05:36,386
My mom recently adopted an oppa.

92
00:05:36,386 --> 00:05:38,828
- He's even younger than I am.
- But your mom is a fan of Eun Woo.

93
00:05:38,828 --> 00:05:40,950
You know how easily my mom falls in love.

94
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,793
How could this happen?

95
00:05:42,793 --> 00:05:47,306
Samuel is young, handsome and talented.

96
00:05:47,306 --> 00:05:50,400
I'll make him debut myself.

97
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,032
I'll break my savings account for you!

98
00:05:53,032 --> 00:05:54,805
Wait for me, Samuel!

99
00:05:54,805 --> 00:05:57,777
It's making me so angry.

100
00:05:57,777 --> 00:06:00,699
Why did he have to get disqualified?

101
00:06:02,701 --> 00:06:05,524
I think I should go home.

102
00:06:05,524 --> 00:06:07,957
I understand. I'm sorry about that.

103
00:06:07,957 --> 00:06:09,859
Do you want me to walk you home?

104
00:06:09,859 --> 00:06:12,951
It's all right. I can go by myself.

105
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:42,030
I bet I'll get in a lot of trouble.

106
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:46,535
Maybe it was better to leave my bag at Deok Hui's?

107
00:07:02,932 --> 00:07:04,353
Gosh...

108
00:07:05,434 --> 00:07:06,935
Ho Gu Hui.

109
00:07:08,098 --> 00:07:09,880
Did you use my computer again?

110
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,391
It's been slow all day for no reason.

111
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:14,693
I didn't use it. Why would I?

112
00:07:14,693 --> 00:07:17,066
You didn't? In any case,

113
00:07:17,066 --> 00:07:19,859
if you ever touch my computer, I won't stand for it, all right?

114
00:07:19,859 --> 00:07:21,820
Are there things in there you don't want me to see?

115
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,954
Never. You must never see it.

116
00:07:24,954 --> 00:07:27,406
If it's embarrassing to show your little sister,

117
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:30,359
you shouldn't be watching them either, Oppa.

118
00:07:30,359 --> 00:07:32,561
- Where's Mom and Dad?
- They're sleeping.

119
00:07:32,561 --> 00:07:35,113
You should go to bed, too.

120
00:07:45,594 --> 00:07:46,975
What?

121
00:07:47,846 --> 00:07:50,069
No one even knew?

122
00:07:55,184 --> 00:07:57,186
That's how I ran away from home

123
00:07:57,186 --> 00:08:00,618
and came back without anyone even knowing.

124
00:08:16,835 --> 00:08:18,157
What do you guys think?

125
00:08:18,157 --> 00:08:20,670
Can you see why people call French

126
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:22,160
the language of love?

127
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,534
For the next group assignment, get into pairs,

128
00:08:25,534 --> 00:08:28,558
find French signs on the street,

129
00:08:28,558 --> 00:08:31,020
and find out what they mean.

130
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:34,224
I'll know if you merely look them up on the Internet!

131
00:08:34,224 --> 00:08:37,457
If you're caught, you'll get a zero. Try if you think you can get away with it.

132
00:08:37,457 --> 00:08:40,779
So until next class...

133
00:08:40,779 --> 00:08:42,820
Au revoir.
(French: goodbye)

134
00:08:52,372 --> 00:08:54,394
Deok Hui, how about we...

135
00:08:54,394 --> 00:08:56,095
What's with the bag?

136
00:08:56,095 --> 00:08:58,748
I'm sorry. I have to leave early today.

137
00:08:58,748 --> 00:09:01,991
Mom wants me to go with her to see Samuel.

138
00:09:01,991 --> 00:09:04,493
I even have a note for an early leave.

139
00:09:04,493 --> 00:09:06,455
I'm off. Sorry.

140
00:09:06,455 --> 00:09:08,187
Bye.

141
00:09:17,566 --> 00:09:18,968
Why are you alone today?

142
00:09:18,968 --> 00:09:20,450
Where's Deok Hui?

143
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:22,491
She went to a fan signing event.

144
00:09:22,491 --> 00:09:25,043
A fan signing event? For whom?

145
00:09:26,156 --> 00:09:27,636
Samuel?

146
00:09:27,636 --> 00:09:30,619
Her mom even signed an early leave slip so she could go.

147
00:09:30,619 --> 00:09:34,493
This is Mo Nan Hui. She can fool even her own mother with her makeup skills.

148
00:09:34,493 --> 00:09:37,506
What kind of girl has brows like those?

149
00:09:37,506 --> 00:09:39,138
Come here.

150
00:09:49,007 --> 00:09:51,390
Did you know that my YouTube channel has over a million views?

151
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,372
Yes. Sure.

152
00:09:53,372 --> 00:09:56,775
Actually, I have a favor to ask you.

153
00:09:56,775 --> 00:09:58,007
What is it?

154
00:09:58,007 --> 00:09:59,939
I like Ji Hun.

155
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:05,774
You're close to Ji Hun. Can you help me out?

156
00:10:05,774 --> 00:10:07,656
In return, I'll introduce you to someone.

157
00:10:07,656 --> 00:10:09,808
I know someone who'd be perfect for you.

158
00:10:09,808 --> 00:10:12,602
That's all right. You don't need to do that.

159
00:10:12,602 --> 00:10:15,254
Don't back out when you really want to.

160
00:10:17,496 --> 00:10:18,877
Come here.

161
00:10:23,132 --> 00:10:26,204
See? Don't you look much more vibrant?

162
00:10:28,046 --> 00:10:29,369
You can have this.

163
00:10:29,369 --> 00:10:31,049
What?

164
00:10:31,049 --> 00:10:34,513
Well... Thanks.

165
00:10:34,513 --> 00:10:37,005
I'm off. I appreciate your help.

166
00:10:49,698 --> 00:10:53,031
Gu Hui, the guy I told you about wants to meet you today.

167
00:10:53,031 --> 00:10:55,824
What? I told you I'm not interested.

168
00:10:55,824 --> 00:10:58,627
No, I already set it up.

169
00:10:58,627 --> 00:11:00,069
But I said I didn't want to.

170
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:02,372
Can't you just go and see him for a second?

171
00:11:02,372 --> 00:11:04,003
Please, Gu Hui? Just once.

172
00:11:04,003 --> 00:11:05,083
Please.

173
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:07,196
It's just that...

174
00:11:07,196 --> 00:11:10,429
You'll go, right? You're going, okay?

175
00:11:10,429 --> 00:11:13,182
- Gu Hui, you're so nice. I'm off.
- What?

176
00:11:26,396 --> 00:11:29,948
I'll just say hello

177
00:11:29,948 --> 00:11:32,081
and leave right away.

178
00:11:36,455 --> 00:11:38,116
Gu Hui,

179
00:11:38,116 --> 00:11:39,368
come over here.

180
00:11:39,368 --> 00:11:41,661
It's been so long.

181
00:11:41,661 --> 00:11:43,912
You've gotten prettier.

182
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:45,634
What are you doing? Get over here.

183
00:11:45,634 --> 00:11:47,266
Come here.

184
00:11:47,266 --> 00:11:50,308
It's so nice to see you.

185
00:11:50,308 --> 00:11:53,652
We must be fated.

186
00:11:53,652 --> 00:11:55,425
I thought you had a girlfriend.

187
00:11:55,425 --> 00:11:56,676
We broke up.

188
00:11:56,676 --> 00:11:59,177
A nice girl like you is the best kind of girlfriend to have.

189
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:00,580
I'm hungry.

190
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:03,482
I'll have the Beijing Spicy Chicken Burger set

191
00:12:03,482 --> 00:12:05,593
and Coke with a lot of ice.

192
00:12:16,446 --> 00:12:17,866
Revenge Note?

193
00:12:17,866 --> 00:12:22,590
I've had such bad luck ever since I got it. It drove me insane.

194
00:12:25,123 --> 00:12:26,895
Are you wearing makeup?

195
00:12:28,046 --> 00:12:30,469
You look a lot better. Keep it up.

196
00:12:30,469 --> 00:12:32,310
Eat up.

197
00:12:43,021 --> 00:12:44,393
You should come.

198
00:12:44,393 --> 00:12:46,565
Oh, my. Are you going to the hagwon?

199
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:49,228
It's so good to run into you. Ji Hun, have you eaten?

200
00:12:49,228 --> 00:12:52,591
You haven't, right? Do you want to eat together? It'll be my treat.

201
00:12:52,591 --> 00:12:54,723
I'll have a hamburger.

202
00:12:54,723 --> 00:12:58,376
Let's go. It's free food.

203
00:12:59,619 --> 00:13:01,540
Just go.

204
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,282
You know how hard it is to get free stuff?

205
00:13:09,167 --> 00:13:12,331
Gu Hui, I've caught you red-handed.

206
00:13:16,756 --> 00:13:19,057
Isn't he...

207
00:13:19,057 --> 00:13:21,119
- You know him?
- What?

208
00:13:23,312 --> 00:13:24,913
Well...

209
00:13:28,226 --> 00:13:31,451
We saw the two of you break up

210
00:13:31,451 --> 00:13:32,821
in front of the building.

211
00:13:32,821 --> 00:13:36,306
What do you mean, we broke up? We were just having a fight.

212
00:13:36,306 --> 00:13:40,278
I'm her first love. Isn't that right?

213
00:13:44,953 --> 00:13:46,686
Ji Hun, it's not...

214
00:13:46,686 --> 00:13:48,987
You two look great together.

215
00:13:48,987 --> 00:13:52,109
Ji Hun, should we go eat somewhere else?

216
00:13:57,296 --> 00:13:59,437
What about our hamburgers?

217
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:04,454
What should we do this Saturday? I have some free time.

218
00:14:04,454 --> 00:14:06,014
You should bring some chicken.

219
00:14:06,014 --> 00:14:08,357
I remember your mom used to like me.

220
00:14:08,357 --> 00:14:12,009
You're not going to eat this? I'll eat it then.

221
00:14:15,864 --> 00:14:17,776
I'm sorry, but I think I should go.

222
00:14:17,776 --> 00:14:19,748
You should stay and eat.

223
00:14:38,337 --> 00:14:39,839
Nan Hui: How's it going?

224
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,139
Jung Wu: Gu Hui is under control

225
00:14:41,139 --> 00:14:42,431
You need to make it work on your end

226
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:44,433
He didn't seem interested in you though.

227
00:14:44,433 --> 00:14:47,766
Nan Hui: None of your business.

228
00:14:51,481 --> 00:14:53,551
It was a misunderstanding...

229
00:14:54,734 --> 00:14:56,674
That won't do.

230
00:14:57,816 --> 00:15:00,158
He probably doesn't even care.

231
00:15:00,158 --> 00:15:03,332
Am I just overreacting?

232
00:15:03,332 --> 00:15:04,794
Gosh.

233
00:15:04,794 --> 00:15:07,124
What should I text him?

234
00:15:08,748 --> 00:15:10,269
Okay.

235
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,111
First loves are

236
00:15:13,111 --> 00:15:16,945
meant to be broken...

237
00:15:16,945 --> 00:15:20,489
Are you insane? Don't talk about your first love.

238
00:15:20,489 --> 00:15:23,872
That's not it. Should I text him or not?

239
00:15:23,872 --> 00:15:26,103
What should I write?

240
00:15:28,346 --> 00:15:31,949
They're shutting off the water soon. If you want to take a shower, do it now.

241
00:15:33,311 --> 00:15:35,024
Okay.

242
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:44,153
God Ji Hun

243
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:51,469
God Ji Hun?

244
00:16:02,971 --> 00:16:04,572
Hello?

245
00:16:12,851 --> 00:16:16,324
Here. I answered a call for you.

246
00:16:25,403 --> 00:16:27,656
Your call is being forwarded to voice mail.

247
00:16:27,656 --> 00:16:31,440
Additional fee will be charged after the beep.

248
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,723
My gosh. Why did you answer my phone?

249
00:16:34,723 --> 00:16:35,855
What did you say?

250
00:16:35,855 --> 00:16:36,956
What did I say?

251
00:16:36,956 --> 00:16:38,087
Hello?

252
00:16:38,087 --> 00:16:39,509
Ten minutes ago

253
00:16:39,509 --> 00:16:41,079
Isn't this Gu Hui's phone?

254
00:16:41,079 --> 00:16:42,951
It is.

255
00:16:42,951 --> 00:16:45,183
She's taking a shower right now.

256
00:16:45,183 --> 00:16:46,785
Who is this?

257
00:16:46,785 --> 00:16:48,386
Me?

258
00:16:48,386 --> 00:16:50,428
I'm the one who showered first.

259
00:16:50,428 --> 00:16:52,280
Where are you?

260
00:16:53,522 --> 00:16:56,125
I'm on top of a bed.

261
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:58,436
Are you insane?

262
00:16:58,436 --> 00:17:01,288
- Why, you crazy...
- Hey.

263
00:17:01,288 --> 00:17:03,001
You're crazy!

264
00:17:03,001 --> 00:17:05,194
How could you lie like that

265
00:17:05,194 --> 00:17:07,156
to your 17-year-old sister's friend?

266
00:17:07,156 --> 00:17:10,239
I didn't lie. Everything I said was true.

267
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:12,411
Forget it. Get out!

268
00:17:12,411 --> 00:17:14,332
Get out! Get out, you pervert!

269
00:17:14,332 --> 00:17:16,165
Get out!

270
00:17:19,377 --> 00:17:21,110
I can't believe this! Seriously!

271
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:25,154
I will take down Gu Jun even if I have to make a pact with the devil.

272
00:17:25,154 --> 00:17:27,635
That imbecile.

273
00:17:29,929 --> 00:17:31,540
Will you be the Revenge Goddess?
Ho Gu Jun

274
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:34,163
Transmission Error

275
00:17:34,163 --> 00:17:37,476
What? Why isn't this working?

276
00:17:37,476 --> 00:17:39,497
Why isn't this working?

277
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,892
I can't believe this.

278
00:17:50,489 --> 00:17:53,342
Look how diligent you are, Gu Hui.

279
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,565
Are you still mad?

280
00:17:56,565 --> 00:17:59,838
Is he your boyfriend or something?

281
00:18:05,254 --> 00:18:08,386
Okay. I'm sorry I did that.

282
00:18:08,386 --> 00:18:10,909
I'll give you 50,000 won. (≈ $45) Let's call it even.

283
00:18:12,972 --> 00:18:14,352
Gu Hui.

284
00:18:14,352 --> 00:18:16,053
Ho Gu Hui.

285
00:18:18,808 --> 00:18:20,148
This wasn't what I was going for.

286
00:18:20,148 --> 00:18:22,271
Gosh, you are such a pushover.

287
00:18:22,271 --> 00:18:23,813
It isn't even something to worry about.

288
00:18:23,813 --> 00:18:26,604
Go and tell him not to misunderstand.

289
00:18:26,604 --> 00:18:28,527
- Go.
- Gu Hui, congratulations.

290
00:18:28,527 --> 00:18:31,320
- I heard you and Jeong Wu hit it off.
- Really?

291
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,122
You're getting back with that jerk?

292
00:18:33,122 --> 00:18:34,573
It's not that...

293
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:37,865
They're back together. Jeong Wu couldn't stop talking about you.

294
00:18:43,962 --> 00:18:45,184
What's next class?

295
00:18:45,184 --> 00:18:46,805
Let's see.

296
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:49,527
My books...

297
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:54,532
What are you doing? The bell rang.

298
00:18:56,935 --> 00:18:58,547
Gosh.

299
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:03,261
Forget it.

300
00:19:08,987 --> 00:19:11,939
Gu Hui, don't you use sunblock?

301
00:19:13,362 --> 00:19:17,495
You can tell?

302
00:19:17,495 --> 00:19:20,318
You're going to keep your promise, right?

303
00:19:20,318 --> 00:19:22,500
You promised to help me

304
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,823
make Ji Hun my boyfriend.

305
00:19:27,126 --> 00:19:30,468
If you betray me, you know what will happen, right?

306
00:19:31,469 --> 00:19:33,210
I trust you.

307
00:19:48,947 --> 00:19:51,740
Ji Hun, I can't figure out this question.

308
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,552
Can you explain it to me?

309
00:19:53,552 --> 00:19:55,203
What is it?

310
00:19:58,117 --> 00:20:00,789
"Find the x-coordinate of intersection X."

311
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:03,833
By the way, isn't it a bit hot today?

312
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:05,464
I'm not sure.

313
00:20:05,464 --> 00:20:06,695
Not really.

314
00:20:06,695 --> 00:20:08,818
Really? It's a bit hot for me.

315
00:20:08,818 --> 00:20:12,320
Ji Hun, who are you going to do the French assignment with?

316
00:20:16,095 --> 00:20:18,306
Do you want me to explain this?

317
00:20:18,306 --> 00:20:21,860
Look at her so obviously hitting on him.

318
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,182
If you look at the X...

319
00:20:23,182 --> 00:20:25,104
Hey, are you okay?

320
00:20:25,104 --> 00:20:27,646
I thought you were into Ji Hun.

321
00:20:27,646 --> 00:20:29,408
Not really.

322
00:20:30,318 --> 00:20:34,431
Don't regret and cry over it later. I won't listen to it.

323
00:20:48,457 --> 00:20:51,380
Hey, isn't that Jeong Wu?

324
00:20:53,632 --> 00:20:56,535
What do I do? He must've come because I didn't answer his calls.

325
00:20:56,535 --> 00:20:57,896
What should I do?

326
00:20:57,896 --> 00:21:00,899
He was dirty when he broke up with you, and he still doesn't have any manners.

327
00:21:00,899 --> 00:21:03,642
What is wrong with him?

328
00:21:03,642 --> 00:21:05,003
I'll solve it for you.

329
00:21:05,003 --> 00:21:07,065
Lee Gang Min, let's do the assignment together.

330
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:09,378
- What?
- Ji Hun, you work with Gu Hui, okay?

331
00:21:09,378 --> 00:21:11,860
You owe me for this. We'll take care of him.

332
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,321
Let's go.

333
00:21:13,321 --> 00:21:15,432
Go.

334
00:21:20,239 --> 00:21:21,779
Let's go.

335
00:21:28,877 --> 00:21:31,178
- Aren't you coming?
- What?

336
00:21:32,421 --> 00:21:34,452
I'm coming.

337
00:21:48,267 --> 00:21:51,820
When you called last time,

338
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:54,273
that was my oppa. He was just making fun of you.

339
00:21:55,573 --> 00:21:57,596
I know.

340
00:21:57,596 --> 00:22:00,779
Do you think I'm stupid enough to believe that?

341
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:03,953
Your oppa is funny.

342
00:22:03,953 --> 00:22:05,513
Really?

343
00:22:07,206 --> 00:22:10,037
So why did you call me?

344
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:12,530
I don't know.

345
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:14,443
I forgot.

346
00:22:14,443 --> 00:22:16,073
Why did I call?

347
00:22:16,885 --> 00:22:18,286
Well...

348
00:22:19,298 --> 00:22:20,889
It's...

349
00:22:20,889 --> 00:22:23,321
Also...

350
00:22:24,392 --> 00:22:27,685
I'm not back together with Jeong Wu.

351
00:22:30,358 --> 00:22:32,039
You're hungry, right?

352
00:22:33,651 --> 00:22:35,193
Let's go eat something.

353
00:22:35,193 --> 00:22:36,625
Sure.

354
00:22:39,868 --> 00:22:42,281
Spicy Tteokbokki*
(*rice cake)

355
00:22:42,281 --> 00:22:44,351
Oh, my.

356
00:22:44,351 --> 00:22:46,785
Why did you order so much food?

357
00:22:46,785 --> 00:22:50,699
From what I've seen before, I thought this would be appropriate.

358
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:55,583
No, I don't eat that much.

359
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,881
This looks so good.

360
00:23:16,025 --> 00:23:17,676
It's okay

361
00:23:17,676 --> 00:23:20,318
if you eat it within three seconds.

362
00:23:27,536 --> 00:23:29,188
Well...

363
00:23:29,188 --> 00:23:32,099
Hang on. I need to use the restroom.

364
00:23:37,005 --> 00:23:40,218
I ordered a mango bingsu*.
(*Ice shavings with condensed milk and fruit)

365
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:41,550
Do you like it?

366
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:43,520
It's my favorite.

367
00:23:54,192 --> 00:23:57,045
Mango bingsu is seriously the best.

368
00:23:58,947 --> 00:24:00,348
Oh.

369
00:24:00,348 --> 00:24:01,679
Wait.

370
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,802
Je t'aime (French: "I love you" 
Isn't that French?

371
00:24:03,802 --> 00:24:06,464
You're right.  "Je t'aime."

372
00:24:07,656 --> 00:24:10,008
- What does that mean?
- What?

373
00:24:15,834 --> 00:24:18,167
I...

374
00:24:18,167 --> 00:24:19,997
love you.

375
00:24:24,302 --> 00:24:26,123
That's what it means.

376
00:24:32,141 --> 00:24:35,964
I think we should take a picture.

377
00:24:35,964 --> 00:24:38,236
Let's take a picture. Come on.

378
00:24:40,278 --> 00:24:42,770
One, two, three.

379
00:24:44,153 --> 00:24:46,816
Yes. Good.

380
00:24:46,816 --> 00:24:49,176
I have sharp eyes.

381
00:24:56,375 --> 00:24:58,967
Every part of you is so small.

382
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,681
Your hands are really small, too.

383
00:25:23,281 --> 00:25:25,963
Maybe I shouldn't have had the mango bingsu.

384
00:25:25,963 --> 00:25:28,816
No, just keep it in.

385
00:25:28,816 --> 00:25:30,018
You have to keep it in.

386
00:25:30,018 --> 00:25:31,910
- Gu Hui, are you okay?
- Yes.

387
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:34,913
Your face turned white.

388
00:25:36,544 --> 00:25:37,896
It's...

389
00:25:37,896 --> 00:25:40,548
Ji Hun, I just remembered something urgent.

390
00:25:40,548 --> 00:25:43,021
I think I have to go. I'm sorry.

391
00:25:46,965 --> 00:25:49,158
What are you two doing here?

392
00:25:49,158 --> 00:25:51,289
What are you doing with Ji Hun?

393
00:25:51,289 --> 00:25:55,013
Nan Hui, something urgent came up, so I have to go.

394
00:25:55,013 --> 00:25:57,686
- Let's talk later.
- Later? We should talk now.

395
00:25:57,686 --> 00:26:00,517
No, Nan Hui, I have to go.

396
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,611
Crap.

397
00:26:06,824 --> 00:26:09,428
That was the worst ever.

398
00:26:09,428 --> 00:26:11,229
Did you just...

399
00:26:11,229 --> 00:26:12,930
It was me.

400
00:26:14,332 --> 00:26:16,064
I was the one who farted.

401
00:26:16,064 --> 00:26:19,507
My stomach didn't feel well. It really stinks, doesn't it?

402
00:26:23,341 --> 00:26:24,903
Guys,

403
00:26:24,903 --> 00:26:27,035
I really have to go. Bye.

404
00:26:27,035 --> 00:26:29,218
He took the fall for me for the second time.

405
00:26:29,218 --> 00:26:32,489
Ji Hun, I'm sorry.

406
00:26:33,931 --> 00:26:35,724
The next day

407
00:26:41,109 --> 00:26:43,500
It's going to rain today. Take an umbrella with you.

408
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:54,072
She must be really mad this time.

409
00:26:55,703 --> 00:26:57,345
What should I do?

410
00:26:59,207 --> 00:27:01,969
Gu Hui, let me see your pouch.

411
00:27:04,212 --> 00:27:07,035
Nan Hui, this is yours, right?

412
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:13,942
Gu Hui, I didn't think you were that type.

413
00:27:13,942 --> 00:27:15,764
It turns out you're a thief.

414
00:27:15,764 --> 00:27:16,955
No, this...

415
00:27:16,955 --> 00:27:19,968
Nan Hui, you gave this to me yesterday.

416
00:27:21,979 --> 00:27:23,651
This tint was sold out.

417
00:27:23,651 --> 00:27:26,315
It's so hard to get this. Why would she give this to you?

418
00:27:26,315 --> 00:27:29,778
I just gave it to her to try it out. I think she must have misunderstood.

419
00:27:29,778 --> 00:27:32,149
Stop it. It's all my fault.

420
00:27:32,149 --> 00:27:34,622
You're too nice to a fault.

421
00:27:35,824 --> 00:27:37,425
I'm giving it back to her.

422
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:44,392
That's jealousy.

423
00:27:45,334 --> 00:27:47,196
Jealousy?

424
00:27:47,196 --> 00:27:49,407
Why would she be jealous of me?

425
00:27:49,407 --> 00:27:53,051
It's because of Ji Hun.

426
00:27:53,051 --> 00:27:55,732
Ji Hun likes you.

427
00:27:57,386 --> 00:27:59,277
No way.

428
00:27:59,277 --> 00:28:01,290
It's true.

429
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:03,792
That's why she's like that.

430
00:28:03,792 --> 00:28:07,115
Gosh. She's full of rage.

431
00:28:15,743 --> 00:28:18,786
Deok Hui, I heard you went to Samuel's fan signing event yesterday.

432
00:28:18,786 --> 00:28:21,119
- How was it?
- How do you know about that?

433
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:24,663
Gu Hui told me. I heard your mom even signed your early leave slip.

434
00:28:24,663 --> 00:28:28,777
I'm jealous you get to be a fan with your mom.

435
00:28:28,777 --> 00:28:30,618
Then you should go with your mom, too.

436
00:28:30,618 --> 00:28:32,491
What's it to you whether I go to a fan signing event

437
00:28:32,491 --> 00:28:34,643
or give them gifts with my mom?

438
00:28:34,643 --> 00:28:36,513
What did you just say?

439
00:28:37,765 --> 00:28:39,328
Jeong Deok Hui,

440
00:28:39,328 --> 00:28:42,090
you told me you were going to a funeral.

441
00:28:43,101 --> 00:28:44,853
How could you lie to me like that?

442
00:28:44,853 --> 00:28:47,305
Follow me.

443
00:29:00,909 --> 00:29:02,099
Introspection Room

444
00:29:02,099 --> 00:29:05,924
Stand up straight. Tell me honestly.

445
00:29:05,924 --> 00:29:10,238
Samuel looks better in person, doesn't he?

446
00:29:10,238 --> 00:29:12,209
Yes.

447
00:29:13,962 --> 00:29:15,752
Put your arms up.

448
00:29:22,431 --> 00:29:26,424
It's too bad Deok Hui got caught by our homeroom teacher.

449
00:29:30,439 --> 00:29:33,402
Did you do that on purpose?

450
00:29:33,402 --> 00:29:36,013
- Why did you do that to Deok Hui?
- Because of you.

451
00:29:36,013 --> 00:29:38,597
Do you think you deserve Ji Hun?

452
00:29:38,597 --> 00:29:41,229
You should know your place.

453
00:29:41,229 --> 00:29:43,642
- That's a misunderstanding.
- Whatever.

454
00:29:43,642 --> 00:29:47,244
Wait and see. I'll make your life miserable.

455
00:29:55,253 --> 00:29:56,804
What's wrong?

456
00:29:56,804 --> 00:29:58,927
- Are you okay?
- I'm sorry, Gu Hui.

457
00:29:58,927 --> 00:30:02,350
I'm sorry. What do you want me to do? Should I get on my knees?

458
00:30:03,762 --> 00:30:05,762
Hey, get up.

459
00:30:08,477 --> 00:30:09,997
What happened?

460
00:30:09,997 --> 00:30:13,221
I think Gu Hui is mad over Ji Hun.

461
00:30:13,221 --> 00:30:16,475
I'm sorry, Gu Hui. I had no idea you liked him.

462
00:30:16,475 --> 00:30:18,637
Guys,

463
00:30:18,637 --> 00:30:21,468
I really have to go. Bye.

464
00:30:24,242 --> 00:30:25,833
How nice of her to leave us alone.

465
00:30:25,833 --> 00:30:27,835
Ji Hun, can you walk me home?

466
00:30:27,835 --> 00:30:29,688
I have something to tell you.

467
00:30:29,688 --> 00:30:30,968
Forget it. Don't do it.

468
00:30:30,968 --> 00:30:32,401
What?

469
00:30:32,401 --> 00:30:35,113
I can't believe this. You don't even know what I'm going to say.

470
00:30:35,113 --> 00:30:37,446
Whatever it is, I'm not interested.

471
00:30:37,446 --> 00:30:39,537
Do you like Gu Hui?

472
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:42,920
- Is that why you're like this?
- Don't bring Gu Hui into this.

473
00:30:43,931 --> 00:30:46,604
I'm just not interested in you at all.

474
00:30:46,604 --> 00:30:49,358
So please stop being interested in me.

475
00:30:49,358 --> 00:30:51,079
Okay?

476
00:30:52,981 --> 00:30:56,334
I'll get going then. Get home safe.

477
00:30:59,818 --> 00:31:01,519
Let's go.

478
00:31:04,622 --> 00:31:06,454
What's going on? Explain it to us.

479
00:31:06,454 --> 00:31:09,377
How could you do that, Gu Hui? What is this about?

480
00:31:09,377 --> 00:31:11,149
Why did she have to get down on her knees?

481
00:31:11,149 --> 00:31:12,630
Look here! Hey!

482
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:15,043
If you have something to say, say it properly!

483
00:31:15,043 --> 00:31:16,835
It's okay.

484
00:31:17,836 --> 00:31:19,237
Let's go.

485
00:31:21,009 --> 00:31:22,720
Deok Hui, how are you feeling?

486
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,263
You got in trouble because of me. I'm sorry.

487
00:31:25,263 --> 00:31:27,596
That's okay. It's not like it's a secret.

488
00:31:27,596 --> 00:31:30,919
She's the bad one for revealing it on purpose.

489
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:32,210
Are you okay?

490
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:35,502
Yes, I'm all right.

491
00:31:46,954 --> 00:31:48,896
Fine.

492
00:31:48,896 --> 00:31:52,159
I won't let you get away with trying to hurt Deok Hui.

493
00:31:56,124 --> 00:31:57,465
Will you proceed with Revenge Note?

494
00:31:57,465 --> 00:31:59,628
Will you be the Revenge Goddess?
Enter target's name.

495
00:32:04,633 --> 00:32:07,055
Mo Nan Hui

496
00:32:07,055 --> 00:32:08,436

00:32:19,147 --> 00:32:21,109

499
00:32:21,109 --> 00:32:23,601
It wasn't me. I didn't do it.

500
00:32:23,601 --> 00:32:25,603
Why spread a rumor like that?

501
00:32:25,603 --> 00:32:26,784
It's unbelievable.

502
00:32:26,784 --> 00:32:28,827
Is it really Ga Eun?

503
00:32:28,827 --> 00:32:30,438
Fine. I like Ji Hun.

504
00:32:30,438 --> 00:32:31,789
Is that something to laugh at?

505
00:32:31,789 --> 00:32:34,111

506
00:32:34,111 --> 00:32:36,734
I am very interested in you.
