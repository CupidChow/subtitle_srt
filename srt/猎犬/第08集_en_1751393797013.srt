1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,880
Dun-Dun

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,320
Aren't you going home?

4
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,960
I was looking for the money.

5
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,560
Hey, it's not easy to get a job these days.

6
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,520
Where's your wife?

7
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,400
My wife wants to go to Paris, but I don't think she can because of Corona.

8
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:05,400
Oh, Corona.

9
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:11,400
What are you doing here at this hour?

10
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,400
Hey, there's a big one.

11
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,400
I've been watching a dead body for about half a year.

12
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,400
He's the kind of guy who takes pictures and threatens people.

13
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:27,400
But I got the list of people who were killed by him today.

14
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:33,400
Anyway, I'll share it as soon as I get it, so let's go in together.

15
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,400
Yes, sir.

16
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:43,400
Let's find a lot of things we've been looking for.

17
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,400
I heard you got the list today.

18
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,400
You wouldn't have done it alone.

19
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:54,400
If you take the guys you were in contact with, you'll get 100 million won each.

20
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,400
When will you be in the location of the dead body?

21
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:05,400
I think it will be possible tomorrow morning.

22
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:13,400
I'll pay you as you receive it.

23
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,400
Here you go.

24
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,400
How is it?

25
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,400
Jangdo is the only one who knows the hard location.

26
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,400
This is the one he saw when he was caught by Mr. Choi.

27
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,400
The guys who were with him then were together.

28
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:39,400
But there's only one hard?

29
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,400
There's only one hard.

30
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:51,400
But there's a backup of the laptop I used to put the hard video in.

31
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,400
Yeah.

32
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,400
You just stay still.

33
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:05,400
If you don't solve the video well, this bastard will be the third investigation of our company.

34
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,400
You're a fucking bastard.

35
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:17,400
Isn't it better to let them know that you have a video?

36
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:25,400
I have to be scared to be a bastard.

37
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,400
You're smart.

38
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,400
Let's make a toast.

39
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:38,400
Cheers.

40
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,400
Have you seen this person?

41
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,400
I don't know.

42
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,400
I don't know because the customers are wearing masks.

43
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,400
Oh, really?

44
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,400
Oh, shit.

45
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:16,400
Look again.

46
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,400
I don't know.

47
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,400
Is it funny?

48
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,400
What?

49
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,400
Is it fucking funny?

50
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,400
No, it's not that.

51
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,400
What the fuck are you doing?

52
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,400
Look at me.

53
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,400
I don't know.

54
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,400
Get up.

55
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,400
Get up.

56
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,400
Look at me.

57
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,400
Look at me.

58
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:44,400
Look at me.

59
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,400
Hello, sir.

60
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,400
Yes, welcome.

61
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,400
I'll ask you something.

62
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,400
I'm looking for someone.

63
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,400
He's my father's friend.

64
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,400
Oh, yes.

65
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,400
You know, right?

66
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,400
Do you know?

67
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,400
Yes, but what's the matter?

68
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,400
I'm getting married this time, so I'd like to give you a wedding invitation.

69
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,400
Oh, do you know where you live?

70
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,400
Of course I know.

71
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,400
I go to the rice delivery once a month.

72
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,400
Can I get your address?

73
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:19,400
Oh, yes, I'll let you know.

74
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:05,400
Here it is.

75
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,400
Newly-made by Kang In-beom.

76
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,400
I'm back.

77
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,400
You're fast.

78
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,400
Speed is life.

79
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,400
Thank you.

80
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:37,400
Done.

81
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,400
Is that it?

82
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,400
Yes.

83
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,400
Oh, you don't know.

84
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:48,400
When I usually do this, I take care of Sojung.

85
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,400
Oh, yes, how much do I have to pay?

86
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,400
Okay, one page.

87
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,400
We're in the same team and we're a family.

88
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,400
One page.

89
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,400
Thank you.

90
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,400
Call me anytime.

91
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,400
Yes, thank you.

92
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,400
Thank you.

93
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,400
Thank you.

94
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,400
Have a good day.

95
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:19,400
Yes.

96
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:33,400
Oh, shit, I called 1 million won.

97
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,400
I told you not to use it.

98
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,400
You have to see it on a big screen to understand the surroundings of the house.

99
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,400
What if Dam-in comes in?

100
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,400
He's not coming.

101
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,400
I happened to pass by and got caught.

102
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,400
I was unlucky.

103
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,400
Kang Dong-gu.

104
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:57,400
Seongguro.

105
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:06,400
It's okay, don't.

106
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,400
What's wrong?

107
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:19,220
It smells like a

108
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,220
No, I'm screwed.

109
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,220
Dam-in.

110
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,220
Why?

111
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:27,220
I'm sorry again today.

112
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:29,220
I'll take responsibility for the smell of the smell.

113
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,220
How?

114
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,220
Diffuser.

115
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:36,220
If you put a diffuser on it, you can catch the smell of the smell.

116
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,220
Really?

117
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:41,220
So basically, to catch the smell, you have to find the other scent.

118
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:46,220
This smell of the smell is a very strong musk scent with a slightly rotten wood scent.

119
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,220
It's a very strong musk scent.

120
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:53,220
To catch this, you have to find the other scent, that is, the floral and fruity scent.

121
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,220
I have a stomach in Diptyque.

122
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:56,220
I like that.

123
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,220
That's great.

124
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,220
It's so good.

125
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:05,220
The fresh sweetness in the stomach will catch the smell of this musk.

126
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,220
We'll buy you a present when we go out later.

127
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,220
Yes.

128
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,220
I'll buy you two.

129
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,220
One on the bottom floor and one on the top floor.

130
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,220
One in the bathroom.

131
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,220
Okay, three.

132
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,220
Call.

133
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,220
How does Kang Inbeom know my number?

134
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,220
Look at this.

135
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,220
No way.

136
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,220
Is something wrong with this?

137
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:35,220
What's wrong with my grandfather?

138
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,220
Who made this?

139
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,220
You.

140
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,220
Hey.

141
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:46,220
Come to the Incheon shopping mall in an hour.

142
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:49,220
If you call the police, I'll kill you.

143
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,220
You're dead to me.

144
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,220
You're dead to me.

145
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,220
You're dead to me.

146
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,220
You're dead to me.

147
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,220
You're dead to me.

148
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,220
You're dead to me.

149
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:06,220
We need to tell you what we said.

150
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,220
They told us to come to the Incheon shopping mall in an hour.

151
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:13,220
If you call the police, they'll kill your grandfather.

152
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,220
Let's go. We don't have time.

153
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,220
Geon-woo.

154
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,220
How many of these guys are coming?

155
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,220
At least 30 people?

156
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,220
They must have weapons.

157
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:39,220
I think Kang Inbeom and the team leader will come.

158
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:42,220
Should I call Kang Kyung-hee?

159
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:44,220
No.

160
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,220
Then I think the driver will be too dangerous.

161
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,220
Then senior.

162
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,220
What senior?

163
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,220
Mr. Moon.

164
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,220
But you hurt your arm.

165
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,220
Won't you help me somehow?

166
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,220
I think so.

167
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:59,220
I think so.

168
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,220
Are you done?

169
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,220
Yes.

170
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:05,220
But where are you going to use the bow?

171
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,220
I'm going to save my grandfather.

172
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,220
No, no, no. It's too dangerous.

173
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,220
We'll go together.

174
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,220
Move.

175
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,220
No, Dam-in.

176
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:18,220
No, no.

177
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,220
I know how to do something.

178
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:30,220
I'm going to go no matter what, so don't stop me.

179
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:33,220
What are you doing? We don't have time.

180
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:36,220
Hey, I think I can sleep.

181
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:39,220
Hey, I think it'll help.

182
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:45,220
Senior, I'm Woo Jin.

183
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:50,220
Driver Oh was kidnapped.

184
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:53,220
Can you help me?

185
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:56,220
I'm also indebted to the driver.

186
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:59,220
Don't go in until you go.

187
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,220
It's an order.

188
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:19,220
The driver is in danger.

189
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,220
The driver is in danger.

190
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:24,220
The driver is in danger.

191
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,220
The driver is in danger.

192
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:30,220
The driver is in danger.

193
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:33,220
The driver is in danger.

194
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:36,220
The driver is in danger.

195
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:39,220
The driver is in danger.

196
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:42,220
The driver is in danger.

197
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:45,220
The driver is in danger.

198
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:06,220
Oh, are our junior soldiers here?

199
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,220
Senior, you prepared a lot.

200
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:12,220
I applied it because I was in the car, but it tickles.

201
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:14,220
I think it's old.

202
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:17,220
Get off before the pimples come up.

203
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,220
I'm in the underground parking lot.

204
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,220
Who are you?

205
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:35,220
I'm here to save my grandfather.

206
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,220
You're a girl.

207
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:40,220
You're right. You have a similar face.

208
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,220
It's been an hour.

209
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:45,220
Okay, okay. What's in that bag?

210
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,220
It's a compound bow.

211
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:50,220
That's a compound bow.

212
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:53,220
Senior, it's a bow for players.

213
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:58,220
Oh, that's right. Archery is Korea.

214
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,220
You're good at shooting, right?

215
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,220
Yes.

216
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:07,220
Good. Yanggung and I are going up the stairs.

217
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:10,220
Our two marines are going through the front door.

218
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,220
We'll support you from above.

219
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,220
Okay?

220
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,220
Yes.

221
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,220
Move.

222
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,220
Follow me.

223
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,220
This way.

224
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,220
Yes.

225
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:42,220
This way.

226
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,220
Where are you?

227
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,720
Kill him!

228
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,300
Kill him!

229
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,380
We lost.

230
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,740
mean me!

231
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:56,780
embassy!

232
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:59,980
We have to beat the hell out of the congress.

233
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:02,220
Hey, hey, hey!

234
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,220
Hey!

235
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,220
That bear, that...

236
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:18,220
That blue one, that blue one!

237
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,220
You're helping your juniors!

238
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:32,220
Hey, blue one!

239
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:54,040
Are you a

240
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:59,180
Go into a

241
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:34,040
What are you doing? Get up.

242
00:17:54,040 --> 00:18:04,040
What are you doing?

243
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:34,040
What are you doing?

244
00:18:54,040 --> 00:19:04,040
Oh, my God.

245
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:14,040
Help me.

246
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,040
If you knew, you wouldn't have a fucking monkey, you bastard.

247
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,040
Pull it out, you fucking bastard.

248
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:31,040
Pull it out.

249
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:34,040
You're going to be in trouble.

250
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:44,040
Come on in.

251
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:11,040
Are you okay?

252
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:21,040
I'm fine.

253
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:31,040
I'm fine.

254
00:20:51,040 --> 00:21:01,040
I'm fine.

255
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:31,040
Hey, you bastard.

256
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,040
You bastard, you don't have time. Get a hold of yourself.

257
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:36,040
Hey, where's Oh Gi-sun?

258
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:41,040
You're looking at the five-month-old scary.

259
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,040
Yang-gung, give me the arrow.

260
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,040
What?

261
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,040
It's okay. Give it to me for a second.

262
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:50,040
You're a very loyal hunter.

263
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:54,040
I did the same before our boss left.

264
00:21:54,040 --> 00:22:00,040
Do you know what a hunter like this is?

265
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:10,040
It's a wild dog that can bite anyone.

266
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,040
No, no.

267
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:16,040
No, this is a surprise, not a pain.

268
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:24,040
The real pain is when you pull this out.

269
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,040
Hey, guys.

270
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:34,040
Please stop Yang-gung.

271
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:38,040
You didn't get married, did you?

272
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:42,040
Family is the most important thing in the world.

273
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:48,040
But if you don't have this, you can't make a family.

274
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:52,040
Work, family, choose one of the two.

275
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:58,040
Even in this situation, if you choose work, I'll recognize you as a professional.

276
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:02,040
Instead, you'll get a hole in your cheek.

277
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,040
Why?

278
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,040
Because I'm a professional, too.

279
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,040
Where do you want to go?

280
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,040
I'll give you three seconds.

281
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:15,040
Three, two, one.

282
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,040
Wait, wait, wait.

283
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:20,040
Why, why, why?

284
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:26,040
I'll tell you today.

285
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,040
Head, head.

286
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:31,040
Get out of here.

287
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:37,040
Head, head.

288
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:42,040
Hey, can you hold Kang In-beom down a little bit?

289
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,040
What are you talking about? I have to go, too.

290
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,040
We'll do it.

291
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,040
You don't have a good arm.

292
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,040
Oh, my God.

293
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:55,040
Oh, sir, I know where Kim Myung-gil's secret fund is.

294
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,040
Where's the safe with the money?

295
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,040
Where did our chief Choi hide the gold?

296
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,040
Please shake this guy off.

297
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,040
As a member of the overseas military.

298
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,040
I beg you.

299
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,040
Okay.

300
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,040
Okay.

301
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,040
Get it, Mr. Oh.

302
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,040
Yes, sir.

303
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,040
Let's go.

304
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:23,040
Let's go.

305
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,040
Here.

306
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,040
How is it?

307
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:39,040
Yes, I've seen this guy standing next to the chief of the Chung-A-Dae.

308
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,040
Chief of the Chung-A-Dae?

309
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,040
Yes, this Hwasal and Gyu-joo.

310
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,040
Are you sure?

311
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,040
Why is this guy in the Chung-A-Dae?

312
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,040
He's a little clumsy.

313
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:57,040
Or it could be a huge hand that we don't know.

314
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,040
Hey.

315
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,040
Yes, I'm sorry I'm late at night.

316
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,040
But I didn't know what to do, so I called you.

317
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,040
Why?

318
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:08,040
Kim Myung-gil kidnapped the driver and is going to Seoryeong with his brother and me.

319
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,040
You guys?

320
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,040
Hey, why are you talking about this now?

321
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:15,040
I'm sorry, but the police said they'd kill the driver.

322
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,040
Hold on.

323
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,040
Did Kim Myung-gil call himself?

324
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:22,040
No, Kim Myung-gil's subordinate, whom we caught, told me.

325
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,040
Then you don't even know Kim Myung-gil is there.

326
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:27,040
Yes.

327
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,040
Take a picture of the location.

328
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:31,040
I'm going to go first, so don't go in and wait.

329
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,040
Yes.

330
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,040
Just send me a text.

331
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:39,040
Yeah.

332
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,040
Yes.

333
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,040
Jaemin, come down to the meeting room for a second.

334
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,040
Now.

335
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:53,040
Yes, sir.

336
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,040
Oh, Jaemin.

337
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,040
Let's call some support.

338
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,040
It's the Seoryeong branch.

339
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,040
Isn't that the theater I talked about before?

340
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,040
Yes, sir.

341
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,040
Okay.

342
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,040
When did you go?

343
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:09,040
A month ago.

344
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:19,040
Yeah.

345
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:27,040
The police are here.

346
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:37,040
Okay.

347
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,040
Hey, the police are here.

348
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:49,040
Start!

349
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:19,040
Start!

350
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,040
Yes.

351
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,040
Jaemin, I'll go check on the situation.

352
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:26,040
Wait a minute.

353
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,040
I went ahead and looked, but there was nothing.

354
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:33,040
It's Director Hwang Ho-young.

355
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:38,040
Brother, please look at that bastard in the back.

356
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,040
What's this bastard?

357
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,040
Kim Yeon-gil, a fool.

358
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:46,040
The guy who stabbed me with that knife.

359
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:51,040
I'm a cop, so answer me properly.

360
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:54,040
You're nodding your head.

361
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,040
Is this the Seoul Western Market?

362
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,040
Yeah.

363
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,040
Does anyone know we're coming here?

364
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:04,040
Yeah.

365
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,040
Oh, brother.

366
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:08,040
These people's parents ran away from us.

367
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:15,040
I think they contacted us first.

368
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,040
Put him down and you guys get out of here.

369
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,040
You guys are not here.

370
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,040
Yes, sir.

371
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,040
There's no place to get hurt, right?

372
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,040
Yes.

373
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:34,040
Hwang-gu.

374
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:37,040
Where's Grandpa?

375
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,040
Let's wait a little longer.

376
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:41,040
The detectives will contact you.

377
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:46,040
I don't have time.

378
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:49,040
I'll find it.

379
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,040
I have to find it.

380
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:57,040
You bastard.

381
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,040
You bastard.

382
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:09,040
You're going to die like this.

383
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:19,040
Give me a cigarette.

384
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:25,040
Give it to me.

385
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,040
Give it to me.

386
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,040
Give it to me.

387
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,040
Give it to me.

388
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:47,040
Give it to me.

389
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,040
What happened?

390
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,040
Where's the chief Oh?

391
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,040
I couldn't find him.

392
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:54,040
I think they noticed and took the chief.

393
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,040
Did Hyeon-chang blow something up?

394
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,040
It's a poison.

395
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:05,040
I don't open my mouth.

396
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,040
Is it fun?

397
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:09,040
Do you want me to show you something more fun?

398
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:23,040
What the hell do you say?

399
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:33,040
I chewed his tongue.

400
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,040
Hey, you bastard.

401
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:37,040
Wake up.

402
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,040
Call an ambulance.

403
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,040
Okay.

404
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,040
Wait, wait, wait.

405
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:44,040
How can I find Kim Byung-gil's safe if I send him away?

406
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:47,040
But I can't get close to people, sir.

407
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:51,040
If you die like this, you can't find the safe.

408
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,040
Give me a cigarette.

409
00:30:53,040 --> 00:31:02,040
Please put this down.

410
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,040
Are you okay?

411
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,040
Wake up.

412
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:13,040
Are you okay?

413
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,040
Hello.

414
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,040
Hello.

415
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,040
Where did the boss go?

416
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:21,040
He went on a vacation.

417
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,040
Give me a cup of coffee and a hand dripper.

418
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:26,040
Okay.

419
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,040
Wait a minute.

420
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:37,040
Wait a minute.

421
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:07,040
Oh, Minbeom.

422
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,040
Kim Byung-gil still has my video.

423
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:15,040
I just sent it.

424
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,040
Hello?

425
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:26,040
Hello?

426
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:56,040
Oh, my God.

427
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:26,040
Song-woo.

428
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:56,040
Oh, my God.

429
00:33:56,040 --> 00:34:06,040
Come on, come on.

430
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,040
Hey, you stupid bastards.

431
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:13,040
Why do you have to come out and make a problem?

432
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,040
What do you want?

433
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:19,040
Come to the farm until 9 tonight.

434
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:24,040
If you call the police again, I'll change the meat and feed the fish.

435
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,040
Okay?

436
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,040
Why aren't you talking?

437
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:32,040
Don't mess with me because Min Kang-yong and the stupid bastards are all in it.

438
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:36,040
And if you crawl out again, I'll kill your mom.

439
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:46,040
Let's see.

440
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,040
Kang Kyung-kyung was attacked?

441
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,040
He's a cop.

442
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,040
I think it's going to be really dangerous this time.

443
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,040
I think it's better for the two of us to go.

444
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,040
Excuse me.

445
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,040
When did you start?

446
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:03,040
I've been here since the beginning.

447
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,040
Don't think about me.

448
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:12,040
I'm going to save Grandpa.

449
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:15,040
Wait a minute.

450
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:24,040
Wait a minute.

451
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:31,040
If something bad happens to Mr. Oh in front of us,

452
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:35,040
Dabin will definitely collapse like Hyun-joo.

453
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,040
I don't want to see that again.

454
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:44,040
But Gun-woo, there's something different about then and now.

455
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,040
Do you know what?

456
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:49,040
There was an invincible navy duo down there.

457
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,040
Not now.

458
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,040
And we got much stronger.

459
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,040
You remember, right?

460
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,040
One, two, three, four, five.

461
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:02,040
One, two, three, four, five.

462
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:12,040
So let's work together to save everyone.

463
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:22,040
Mr. Oh, Dabin, and everyone who was hurt by Kim Myung-gil.

464
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:27,040
Huk.

465
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:31,040
Huk.

466
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:39,040
Huk.

467
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,040
Why are you standing?

468
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,040
I'll go in with you first.

469
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,040
I'll watch from outside.

470
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,040
Come in when you get a good place to be.

471
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:56,040
Let's get off.

472
00:36:56,040 --> 00:37:06,040
I'll go in with you first.

473
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:14,040
I'll go in with you first.

474
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:19,040
I put it down far away.

475
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:22,040
You did a good job.

476
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:27,040
I put it down far away to keep Dabin from getting hurt.

477
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:31,040
I put it down early so that I wouldn't get caught.

478
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,040
It's a little far.

479
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,040
I think it'll take about 10 minutes.

480
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,040
Let's just finish it quickly.

481
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:48,040
Let's go.

482
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:18,040
Let's go.

483
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:48,040
I'm going to kill you.

484
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:54,040
Help me.

485
00:38:54,040 --> 00:39:04,040
Let's go.

486
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:34,040
Let's go.

487
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:44,040
Let's go.

488
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:54,040
Let's go.

489
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:24,040
You bastard.

490
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:33,040
Hey, can't you two get rid of the kids?

491
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,040
I'm sorry.

492
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:42,040
You're sorry every day, aren't you?

493
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:47,040
Stop it.

494
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:51,040
Hey, if you move a finger, you'll get a head injury.

495
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,040
You do it yourself.

496
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,040
That's right.

497
00:40:55,040 --> 00:41:04,040
Stop moving.

498
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,040
What are you doing, you bastards?

499
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,040
Why don't you kill me quickly?

500
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,040
You want me to kill you?

501
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:17,040
I don't have a chance to come in, you bastards.

502
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:27,040
Sit down.

503
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,040
You bastard.

504
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,040
Come here.

505
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,040
Come here.

506
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:41,040
You bastard.

507
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:47,040
Who are you?

508
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:57,040
I said kill me.

509
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:07,040
I'm sorry.

510
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:17,040
Grandpa, are you okay?

511
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:25,040
It's me, Dami.

512
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:31,040
I'm sorry.

513
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:35,040
Are you okay?

514
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:45,040
Thank you.

515
00:42:55,040 --> 00:43:01,040
Who are you?

516
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:11,040
Jjajangmyeon delivery.

517
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:19,040
What are you doing?

518
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:27,040
What's this?

519
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,040
I found it.

520
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:38,040
Come here, everyone.

521
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:42,040
I'm the chief of the Central Police Department.

522
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,040
This is the receipt.

523
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,040
I'll pay the receipt in real time.

524
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,040
I'd like to ask you to come in.

525
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,040
Come on.

526
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:55,040
Come on in.

527
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,040
Mr. Kim Jaemin.

528
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:02,040
You're under arrest for murder and bribery.

529
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,040
I feel so good.

530
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:07,040
Let's go.

531
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:17,040
Let's go.

532
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:21,040
Fortunately, the warrant came out quickly, so I went into Kim Yeonkyul's house.

533
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:24,040
There were a lot of cell phones in the closet drawer.

534
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:29,040
I checked the numbers, and they were all dead or missing.

535
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:34,040
This crazy bastard kept the cell phones of the people he killed.

536
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:36,040
This is a trap.

537
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,040
I can't even see the president of Korea.

538
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,040
What about overseas escape?

539
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:42,040
It's difficult because it's in a deadly state.

540
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:45,040
You often run away to China on a freight train.

541
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:48,040
Kim Yeon-kyul is a level A deadly enemy.

542
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:50,040
I'm going to focus on the possible routes.

543
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:52,040
I can't get out of Korea easily.

544
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:54,040
But it's not impossible.

545
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:59,040
I think everyone thinks it's over, but I'm actually very anxious right now.

546
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,040
He still has my video.

547
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:08,040
When are you going to go crazy and solve it?

548
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:14,040
I really need to see him in jail.

549
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:22,040
I understand.

550
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:25,040
It's good that you're in Korea now.

551
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:28,040
Tae-young hasn't even opened her eyes yet.

552
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:38,040
I need some time to think about it.

553
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:40,040
We'll help you.

554
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:43,040
It's not over until it's over.

555
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:47,040
Can you find out where Im Jang-do is?

556
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,040
Why is Im Jang-do?

557
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:52,040
Im Jang-do is probably hiding somewhere from Kim Yeon-kyul.

558
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:57,040
But I think Im Jang-do might know where Kim Yeon-kyul is going to run away.

559
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,040
That's right.

560
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:00,040
Im Jang-do can teach you how to push.

561
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:04,040
He used to say he was in charge of that.

562
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:14,040
Okay, I'll find out.

563
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,040
Don't tell me.

564
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:18,040
I think I could've heard up to 1,800.

565
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:23,040
Im Jang-do hasn't used his cell phone or credit card for half a year.

566
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:26,040
I avoided everything that could be traced.

567
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,040
Is there any way?

568
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:33,040
Well, all we've found is Im Jang-do's account number.

569
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:37,040
That's the last thing we got from Suwon in March.

570
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,040
What's the difference with that?

571
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:42,040
I need to check the CCTVs for a few months, so I'll have to deliver it.

572
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:45,040
It takes some time.

573
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:48,040
Can we get his account number?

574
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:51,040
This guy's gonna make a lot of money.

575
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,040
Here, make money with your account.

576
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:56,040
When you're making money, write down the phone number you're going to get in the name of the person you're paying.

577
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:58,040
Then you'll get 100% contact.

578
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:59,040
How much do I have to spend?

579
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,040
It's one page.

580
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:03,040
10,000 won?

581
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:09,040
I forgot to tell you last time, but in our industry, one page is different from time to time.

582
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:14,040
When I told you about Kang In-beom last time, that one page was not 10,000 won, but 1 million won.

583
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,040
1 million won?

584
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:18,040
Of course, I'm not saying I'm going to take it.

585
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:19,040
I'm not a bad person.

586
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,040
We're family.

587
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:24,040
How much is one page in our situation?

588
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:26,040
Don't laugh at a million won.

589
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:28,040
10 million won.

590
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:31,040
It's right on the line.

591
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:43,040
If you keep running like that, the wound will get worse.

592
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:45,040
Oh, my God.

593
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,040
Say hello.

594
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,040
Yes, sir.

595
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,040
Get up.

596
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:12,040
66, 63, 68, 69.

597
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,040
I don't have a number.

598
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,040
Hello?

599
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,040
Hello?

600
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,040
Hello?

601
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:37,040
You're the one who was with Choi Seo-jung, right?

602
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,040
Yes.

603
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:44,040
The police told me before I left.

604
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:47,040
What?

605
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:49,040
I gave you money.

606
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:52,040
Kim Myung-gil is running away.

607
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:53,040
Why?

608
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:58,040
I found evidence that Kim Myung-gil killed someone at the police station.

609
00:48:58,040 --> 00:48:59,040
When is that?

610
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,040
Two days ago.

611
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:04,040
You know where Kim Myung-gil is running away, right?

612
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,040
I know.

613
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,040
Please.

614
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:12,040
We want to catch Kim Myung-gil.

615
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:13,040
Please help us.

616
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:17,040
How much are you going to give me?

617
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,040
One page.

618
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:24,040
Oh, my God.

619
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:27,040
100 million won.

620
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,040
100 million won?

621
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:30,040
I trusted Mr. Choi.

622
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:31,040
I'm screwed right now.

623
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,040
I need that much compensation.

624
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:35,040
But what we have now is...

625
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:39,040
Mr. Kim, I'll teach you how to get out of here.

626
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:41,040
You know what I mean, right?

627
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,040
Think about it.

628
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,040
No way.

629
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,040
How can I get 100 million won?

630
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:54,040
Let's ask the driver.

631
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:56,040
You don't have any money, do you?

632
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:58,040
He said the last money he gave me was the emergency fund.

633
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,040
Wait.

634
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:07,040
How much is in there?

635
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:12,040
I think it's only 300 million won.

636
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,040
It's not enough.

637
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,040
Should I ask Min Beom-hee?

638
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:21,040
The video of Min Beom-hee is on the website.

639
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:24,040
Can you help me with this?

640
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:29,040
But there's no one else who has that much money.

641
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,040
Let me ask you once.

642
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:36,040
I'll ask the driver.

643
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,040
I brought the driver.

644
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:50,040
Do you guys trust Im Jang-do?

645
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:59,040
I think I can trust him as much as he has.

646
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:02,040
What if he gets 100 million won and goes abroad?

647
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,040
What are you going to do then?

648
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:06,040
I'll ask him.

649
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:29,040
If Im Jang-do breaks the promise and runs away,

650
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:31,040
we'll chase him to the end and catch him.

651
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:34,040
I'll promise you this.

652
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,040
I'll do it.

653
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,040
Keep your promise.

654
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,040
Yes.

655
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:55,040
Yes.

656
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,040
Yes, sir.

657
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:07,040
Move.

658
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,040
Yes.

659
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,040
You can go.

660
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,040
That's it.

661
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:08,040
At 1 a.m. on Monday,

662
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:12,040
a 27-ton cargo ship called Nikheo left Pohang Shinilman as a citizen.

663
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:15,040
The person who paid the tax for Mr. Kim is a senior official of the Vietnamese government.

664
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:17,040
He'll take all the unpaid money he hid and move on.

665
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:21,040
The container number is TGBU 9004230.

666
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:24,040
There will be a hidden container in the container.

667
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:26,040
Kim Young-gil will try to get on the ship.

668
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,040
I'll go to the container.

669
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:29,040
I'll go to the container.

670
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,040
I'll go to the container.

671
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:33,040
I'll go to the container.

672
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,040
Should Kim Young-gil try to get on the ship?

673
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,040
It's not easy to catch him because he's big.

674
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,040
Then how do you find him?

675
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,040
You guys get on the ship together.

676
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:45,040
Are you telling us to get on the ship and go to Vietnam?

677
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,040
You guys take care of that.

678
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,040
But I...

679
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:49,040
Wait, wait, wait.

680
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:52,040
What should we do if we want to get on the ship?

681
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:54,040
I'll leave a message to contact you.

682
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:56,040
Make sure you get my name.

683
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:58,040
For your information, you like cash.

684
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:05,040
The message is here.

685
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:18,040
I didn't know what you needed, so I prepared one by one.

686
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:20,040
Thank you.

687
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:21,040
Take care of yourself.

688
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:23,040
Yes.

689
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:26,040
Huh?

690
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:28,040
Yes.

691
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:31,040
Let's go up.

692
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:33,040
Go up first.

693
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:35,040
Let's talk.

694
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:39,040
Okay.

695
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:46,040
Thank you for helping me.

696
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:48,040
We're the ones who should be thankful.

697
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:00,040
Hi, Dam-in.

698
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:03,040
Hi.

699
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,040
Go up.

700
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:11,040
You know my number, right?

701
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:21,040
Let's go.

702
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:32,040
Yes, brother.

703
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:33,040
Are you going down?

704
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:35,040
I'm on my way.

705
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:38,040
Don't get hurt, okay?

706
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:39,040
Okay.

707
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:41,040
I'll take care of the rest of the things.

708
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:43,040
Drive safe.

709
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,040
Okay.

710
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:02,040
Let's go.

711
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:21,040
Let's go quickly.

712
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:23,040
Wait a minute.

713
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:24,040
Wait a minute.

714
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:32,040
Brother.

715
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:39,040
Okay.

716
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:50,040
Let's go.

717
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,040
Let's take a look inside first.

718
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:32,040
Kim Myeong-gi!

719
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:02,040
Oh, my God.

720
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:14,040
Oh, my God.

721
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:33,040
Oh, my God.

722
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:03,040
Oh, my God.

723
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:33,040
Oh, my God.

724
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:02,040
Oh, my God.

725
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:33,040
Oh, my God.

726
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:03,040
Oh, my God.

727
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:32,040
Oh, my God.

728
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:02,040
Oh, my God.

729
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:34,040
If you show up again,

730
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:40,040
I'll kill you.

731
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:47,040
I'm going to kill you.

732
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:53,040
I'm going to kill you.

733
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:56,040
I'm going to kill you.

734
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:58,040
I'm going to kill you.

735
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:08,040
Then die.

736
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:38,040
Gunwoo.

737
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:51,560
Are you okay?

738
01:03:58,040 --> 01:04:08,040
What's wrong?

739
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:18,040
I think I'm a hunter.

740
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:38,040
Gunwoo, did you forget your heart?

741
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:42,040
You can go back to the way it was.

742
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:50,040
Let's go back with me.

743
01:04:50,040 --> 01:05:00,040
Yeah, let's go back.

744
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:11,040
Wait.

745
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:27,040
Hey!

746
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:37,040
I found it.

747
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:38,040
Yeah.

748
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:40,040
Yes, where are you?

749
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:41,040
I'm here.

750
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:43,040
Did you find the gold?

751
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:46,040
Yes, I found it.

752
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:49,040
Where's your cell phone?

753
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:51,040
I'll take it.

754
01:05:51,040 --> 01:06:01,040
Let's go.

755
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:03,040
What happened?

756
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:07,040
I finally found my cell phone.

757
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:09,040
Good job.

758
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:11,040
I asked for an interpol employee.

759
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:13,040
They'll be waiting in Vietnam.

760
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:15,040
It's all over.

761
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:17,040
You did a great job.

762
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:27,040
Thank you.

763
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:39,040
What do you want me to do?

764
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:47,040
The boss always wanted to help people who couldn't be treated because of poverty.

765
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:52,040
So I want this money to be used as you want.

766
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:55,040
What about you?

767
01:06:55,040 --> 01:07:01,040
Don't you want this money?

768
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:04,040
I want to, brother.

769
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:07,040
But this money isn't mine.

770
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:11,040
I paid back the debt you gave me.

771
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:17,040
I just kept my promise with you.

772
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:23,040
Guys, there are 168 gold bars here.

773
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:25,040
Today's debt is 500,000 won.

774
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:27,040
Roughly 840,000 won.

775
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:33,040
If you want, I'll bring this and set up a welfare foundation for our group.

776
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:39,040
I can provide treatment for those in need through the welfare foundation.

777
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:45,040
Or we can make a hospital with some money.

778
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:47,040
That's a good idea.

779
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:51,040
I think my father will like it.

780
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:53,040
I think it'll help the group's image.

781
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:55,040
It's a good thing in the world.

782
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:59,040
I'll finish the hotel and make money.

783
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:03,040
Can I put your name in the hospital's name?

784
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:04,040
My name is?

785
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:06,040
Choi Tae-ja Ho-ja.

786
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:12,040
It'll be hard to be honest, but I'll think about it.

787
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:22,040
Thank you, brother.

788
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:24,040
I'll pay back the debt with my own money.

789
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:27,040
It's a bonus for doing a good job.

790
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:29,040
No, I'm really fine.

791
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:37,040
I'm sure the boss did the same.

792
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:43,040
I don't know what to say.

793
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:45,040
Thank you.

794
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:47,040
Thank you, boss.

795
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:54,040
No, I'm thankful to you.

796
01:08:54,040 --> 01:09:04,040
Thank you so much.

797
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:14,040
Thank you.

798
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:16,040
Oh, Gun-woo.

799
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:20,040
Where are you?

800
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:30,040
Oh, Gun-woo.

801
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:40,040
Oh, my son.

802
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:47,040
Oh, my son.

803
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:50,040
Oh, my son.

804
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:53,040
What's with your face?

805
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:59,040
Oh, I've tried.

806
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:01,040
Let's go home.

807
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:04,040
Yeah.

808
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:14,040
Did you sleep well?

809
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:44,040
I'm sorry.

810
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:14,040
I'm sorry.

811
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:44,040
I'm sorry.

812
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:44,040
I'm sorry.

813
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:14,040
I'm sorry.

814
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:44,040
I'm sorry.

815
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:14,040
I'm sorry.
