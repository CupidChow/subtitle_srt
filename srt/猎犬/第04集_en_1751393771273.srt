00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Episode 2

3
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,120
Hey, team leader Bae.

4
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,620
Find the house of the lady who owns a cafe on the first floor of the Seoul Building.

5
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,360
Nice-gu-en.

6
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,520
Will you kill me or are you leaving the team?

7
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,000
Worse of the championships,

8
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,360
the first final makeover with Withers to the final.

9
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,300
N exempted left in the center.

10
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:57,100
Nan hyang Seung got a creativeZero.

11
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,060
Let go of it!

12
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,800
Let go!

13
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:32,720
Hey, hey!

14
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,180
Teacher.

15
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,100
You bastard!

16
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,100
You bastard!

17
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,100
You bastard!

18
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:00,100
You bastard!

19
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,100
You bastard!

20
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,100
You bastard!

21
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,100
You bastard!

22
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,100
Let's go.

23
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,100
Let's go.

24
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,100
Thank you for coming.

25
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,100
I'm sorry I'm late.

26
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,100
I'm glad you came.

27
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,100
It hurts.

28
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,100
You're here.

29
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,100
You bastard!

30
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,100
Kwon.

31
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,100
Hurry up.

32
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,100
Hurry up.

33
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,100
Come on.

34
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,100
Hurry up.

35
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,100
What's wrong with him?

36
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,100
I'm so tired of him.

37
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,100
Hurry up.

38
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,100
You bastard!

39
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,100
You bastard!

40
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,100
You bastard!

41
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,100
Hurry up.

42
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,100
You bastard!

43
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,100
Who the hell are you?

44
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,100
Shut up, you bastard.

45
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,100
Get up.

46
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,100
Get up.

47
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,100
You bastard!

48
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,100
You bastard.

49
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,100
Hey.

50
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,100
Who the hell are you?

51
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,100
I'm sorry.

52
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,100
What the hell are you doing?

53
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,100
Sleep tight.

54
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,100
What's this?

55
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,100
When did I get hit like this?

56
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,100
Yes, mom.

57
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,100
Kwon.

58
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,100
What's wrong?

59
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,100
What's wrong?

60
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,100
I'll change your seat.

61
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,100
Where are you?

62
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,100
Kwon.

63
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,100
What's wrong with your forehead?

64
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,100
It's okay.

65
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,100
It's just a scratch on the floor.

66
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,100
Your face...

67
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,100
Woojin, what's wrong with your face?

68
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,100
It's just a scratch.

69
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,100
The boss couldn't sleep and was waiting for you.

70
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,100
Let's go downstairs.

71
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,100
Yes.

72
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,100
I'll be back.

73
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,100
Sit down, everyone.

74
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,100
I won't say anything because I'm tired.

75
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:27,100
I was called by you and the world collapsed.

76
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,100
You're my family.

77
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,100
I was so scared that I might lose you.

78
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,100
I know you're hurt.

79
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,100
From now on, the adults will take care of it.

80
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,100
I want to help, too.

81
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:48,100
Kwon, this is not a game where someone wins and loses.

82
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,100
It's a war that ends when one person dies.

83
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,100
I'm sorry.

84
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,100
You two go up.

85
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,100
I'm sorry.

86
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,100
Promise me you won't come out twice.

87
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,100
Yes.

88
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:19,100
They know Kwon's house, so it's dangerous to go now.

89
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,100
Bring the boss to the orphanage tomorrow.

90
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,100
It's much safer to stay there for a while.

91
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,100
Yes.

92
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,100
Good night.

93
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,100
What should I do now?

94
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,100
I'll see you off.

95
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:48,100
It's something I should have solved a long time ago.

96
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,100
Can you catch Myeong-gyu?

97
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,100
I'll move with Du-young from tomorrow.

98
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,100
I'll take care of one person.

99
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,100
Let's eat with Du-young.

100
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:01,100
Mr. Oh, please find out what kind of people are in Myeong-gyu's pocket.

101
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,100
Yes.

102
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,100
Oh, my God.

103
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,100
Oh, my God.

104
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,100
Oh, my God.

105
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,100
Oh, my God.

106
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,100
Oh, my God.

107
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,100
Oh, my God.

108
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,100
Oh, my God.

109
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,100
Oh, my God.

110
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,100
Oh, my God.

111
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,100
Oh, my God.

112
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,100
Oh, my God.

113
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,100
Oh, my God.

114
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,100
Oh, my God.

115
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,100
Oh, my God.

116
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,100
Oh, my God.

117
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,100
Oh, my God.

118
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,100
Oh, my God.

119
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,100
Oh, my God.

120
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,100
Oh, my God.

121
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,100
Oh, my God.

122
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,100
Oh, my God.

123
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,100
Oh, my God.

124
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,100
Oh, my God.

125
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,100
Oh, my God.

126
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,100
Oh, my God.

127
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,100
Oh, my God.

128
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,100
Oh, my God.

129
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,100
Oh, my God.

130
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,100
Oh, my God.

131
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,100
Oh, my God.

132
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,100
Oh, my God.

133
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,100
Why are you up so early?

134
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,100
I'm supposed to come.

135
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,100
I got the surgery for you.

136
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,100
Thank you.

137
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:50,100
The other guy cut off all the tendons on his shoulders.

138
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,360
He had a short waist and his eyes were wide open.

139
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,200
He was very quick.

140
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,200
And he was really good at using a knife.

141
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,100
Yes.

142
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,400
Yes.

143
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,800
It was like a knife from a sashimi restaurant.

144
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,800
Tell Bum-hee to come to the office by 1 o'clock. Let's have a meeting.

145
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,800
Yes.

146
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,800
It's getting interesting.

147
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,800
I'll go with you.

148
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,800
Wait.

149
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,800
I want to help you.

150
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,800
Indong.

151
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,800
I'll take care of it.

152
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,800
You live your life.

153
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,800
Brother.

154
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,800
I want to be with you.

155
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,800
Hey.

156
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,800
I want to be with you.

157
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,800
I want to be with you.

158
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,800
I want to be with you.

159
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,800
I want to be with you.

160
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,800
I want to be with you.

161
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,500
I cleaned up and came back.

162
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,500
What are you going to do if the store is ruined?

163
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,500
Keep the store. That's helping me.

164
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,500
But still...

165
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,500
Look at the store.

166
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,500
I'm going to go to the office.

167
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,500
I'm going to go to the office.

168
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,500
I'm going to go to the office.

169
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,500
I'm going to go to the office.

170
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,500
I'm going to go to the office.

171
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,500
I'm going to go to the office.

172
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,500
I'm going to go to the office.

173
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,500
I'm going to go to the office.

174
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,500
I'm going to go to the office.

175
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,500
I'm going to go to the office.

176
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,500
I'm going to go to the office.

177
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,500
I'm going to go to the office.

178
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,500
I'm going to go to the office.

179
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,500
I'm going to go to the office.

180
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,200
Hwang Hyeonjung.

181
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,200
Long time no see.

182
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,200
You should've called me.

183
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,200
I was busy eating and living.

184
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,200
Why are you so old?

185
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,200
Is it easy to live a honest life?

186
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,200
Right?

187
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,200
Isn't it hard to live a honest life?

188
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,200
Long time no see.

189
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,200
I called Sucheol and Minsoo

190
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,200
and looked them up.

191
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,200
They're a bit big.

192
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,200
They're not just private owners.

193
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,200
They're weird.

194
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,900
Thank you.

195
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,900
I heard a friend came here.

196
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:57,900
The IL Group bought a hotel in Gangnam.

197
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,900
They used my money for Smile Capital.

198
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,900
That's Kim Myeonggil's company, right?

199
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:03,900
Yes.

200
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,900
But why did Jaewol lose Kim Myeonggil's money?

201
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,900
I don't understand.

202
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,900
Kim Myeonggil must've done something.

203
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,600
Let's see.

204
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,600
They finally got their revenge.

205
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,600
Let's see.

206
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,600
The boss allowed it.

207
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:33,600
There were five people under Chairman Choi.

208
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,600
Chairman Choi used to be a company owner

209
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,600
and had millions of dollars in his bank account.

210
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,300
There were many times when he was over 100 million won.

211
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:46,300
But there were bandits who watched over the construction site.

212
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:52,300
They would go out and kill a group of bandits in one day.

213
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:57,300
The big bandits were really scared of Chairman Choi's knife-cutters.

214
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,300
After I got rid of Chairman Choi,

215
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:07,300
the first thing I did with Beom was to be a friend of the knife-cutters.

216
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,300
Do you know why?

217
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I was so scared, too.

218
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Did you catch him with your own two hands?

219
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I sent two teams of bandits to Shindang-dong and Yeongdeungpo.

220
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
They could've caught him when they were far away.

221
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
If they were together, they wouldn't have caught him.

222
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Wow, you're amazing.

223
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:35,000
But Jeongja couldn't catch the two most important people.

224
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:39,700
Lee Duyeong and Hwang Yangjun.

225
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:43,700
Left arm of Chairman Choi and right arm.

226
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:48,700
I ran into Lee Duyeong once while I was looking at his bag.

227
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,700
He was handsome.

228
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:57,700
Once, a group of bandits blocked the car and pulled down the window to light a cigarette.

229
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,700
I heard the sound of a motorcycle and looked back.

230
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,400
Duyeong ran away with his face in his hand.

231
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,400
His mouth got this big.

232
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,400
That's amazing.

233
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,400
Who's Hwang Yangjun?

234
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:20,400
He said he made a fool out of 20 people with an achilles' heel.

235
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,400
He said he stabbed a man a hundred times in a minute.

236
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,400
That's amazing.

237
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,100
I heard three of the kids were there.

238
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,100
Yes.

239
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,100
A girl appeared in the middle.

240
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:36,100
I think she was connected to the book store.

241
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:42,100
It makes no sense if the owner of the book store is Chairman Choi.

242
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,100
He crawled out to save those bastards.

243
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,100
Do you know how much money Chairman Choi has?

244
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,100
With cash?

245
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:57,800
It's worth 5 billion won.

246
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,800
That's a lot of money.

247
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,800
The sky is helping us.

248
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,800
Jangdo and Beom are ambushed.

249
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,800
The children are watching the kids.

250
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,800
Aren't you getting off?

251
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,800
I don't want to go in.

252
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,800
Go ahead.

253
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,800
Okay. I'll be right back.

254
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,800
Come this way.

255
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,800
The children's room is small, but you'll be fine.

256
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,500
Take your time.

257
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,500
Thank you.

258
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,500
Mom, how is it here?

259
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,500
It's your brother.

260
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,500
Hello, Mom.

261
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,500
One of my friends in elementary school was under the team leader of Kim Byung-kyu.

262
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,500
He was there that day.

263
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:30,500
He was really mean.

264
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,500
He was waiting at the gas station.

265
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:37,500
As soon as the R group leader came in, he was arrested and threatened.

266
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:41,500
Those who do that to me are the only ones in Korea.

267
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,500
So?

268
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,500
I took a video.

269
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,200
I took a video.

270
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:02,200
It's a fraud case against a film director named Kim Joon-min.

271
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:07,200
He's been fraudulent in various ways.

272
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,200
He was in the Seoul South-North District Office.

273
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,900
Kim Jang-do.

274
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:17,900
He was a police officer and was expelled from the school.

275
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:21,900
He's a chief of strategy planning at Schmal Capital.

276
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,900
That's a lot.

277
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:28,900
If there's someone who knows how the police work, it's very helpful to avoid police investigation.

278
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,900
Are these two?

279
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,900
Yes.

280
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,900
What's the address of the house?

281
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,900
I have a name.

282
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:40,900
I live in a private house and have a car number and a car number.

283
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,600
I think I'll call you.

284
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,600
I'm going to be careful.

285
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,600
Yes.

286
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,600
I'll do the next one.

287
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,600
Tomorrow night?

288
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,600
How much do you catch?

289
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,600
What do you mean how much?

290
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,600
I'll send it right away.

291
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,600
I'll call Kim Myeong-kyu.

292
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,600
He's not the only one.

293
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,600
Everything about him is a trick.

294
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,600
Go with Do-young.

295
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,600
I'll step on the back.

296
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:14,300
Was there a big guy who stood next to Myeong-kyu?

297
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,300
Yes.

298
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,300
The police asked for a little more time.

299
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,300
I'll find out more.

300
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,300
Who is it?

301
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:26,300
It's Chang-seo, the guy who threw me out the window.

302
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:34,300
Boss, how are you going to transfer the cash to the book room?

303
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,300
I have to move.

304
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,300
I know where this is.

305
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
How about the kids moving the cash?

306
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I don't have time and I'm not good enough.

307
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I don't think they're normal.

308
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I pushed 30 people.

309
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Did you see it?

310
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I saw it.

311
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I didn't use a knife and I used 30 people.

312
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
They're not normal kids.

313
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Boss, I think it's okay to move at dawn.

314
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,700
You guys can trust me.

315
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,700
Hyun-joo is smart, too.

316
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,700
Yes, put it here.

317
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,700
It looks delicious.

318
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,700
Thank you for the meal.

319
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,700
Try it.

320
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,700
I'll put it on the table.

321
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,700
Thank you.

322
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,400
It's delicious.

323
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,400
Did you make this with our kimchi?

324
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,400
Yes.

325
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,400
It tastes different from what I made.

326
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,400
It's easy. I'll teach you.

327
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,400
I have a question.

328
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:09,100
Do you run the orphanage?

329
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:14,100
Yes, my grandfather was poor.

330
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:18,100
He wanted to help people who had a hard time.

331
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,100
Is Hyun-joo your granddaughter?

332
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:28,100
No, I went to the orphanage after my parents died.

333
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,100
I'm sorry.

334
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,100
I shouldn't have said that.

335
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,800
No, it's okay.

336
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,800
I'm sorry.

337
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,800
What does Hyun-joo eat?

338
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,800
I like rolled omelet.

339
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,800
Then eat this.

340
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,800
Where are all the rolled omelet?

341
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,800
You should have left some for your sister.

342
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,800
I wanted to eat rolled omelet.

343
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,800
I'll make it again.

344
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,800
No, it's okay.

345
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,800
No, it's okay.

346
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,800
Make it big and thick.

347
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,800
Okay.

348
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,800
I'll make it big.

349
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,800
Eat.

350
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,500
Eat.

351
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,500
Hey, look at the color of this jangjorim.

352
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,500
I'll make it big.

353
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,200
I'll make it big.

354
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,200
It's pretty.

355
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,200
I'll make it big.

356
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,200
Did you pack everything?

357
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,200
I'll make it big.

358
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,200
I'll make it big.

359
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,200
I'll make it big.

360
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,200
I'll make it big.

361
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,200
I'll make it big.

362
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,200
I'll make it big.

363
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,200
I'll make it big.

364
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,200
I'll make it big.

365
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,200
I'll make it big.

366
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,200
I'll make it big.

367
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,200
I'll make it big.

368
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,200
I'll make it big.

369
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,200
I'll make it big.

370
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,900
I'll make it big.

371
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,900
I'll make it big.

372
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,900
I'll make it big.

373
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,900
I'll make it big.

374
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,900
I'll make it big.

375
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,900
I'll make it big.

376
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,900
I'll make it big.

377
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,900
I'll make it big.

378
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,900
I'll make it big.

379
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,900
I'll make it big.

380
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,900
I'll make it big.

381
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,900
I'll make it big.

382
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,600
I'll make it big.

383
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,600
Don't open the box. I'll get the money.

384
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,600
How are we going to move the car?

385
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,600
Let's take each one.

386
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,100
No, he's too slow.

387
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,600
Do you have a cart?

388
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,000
Go down one floor, turn left and you'll find it.

389
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,600
You and I will get the cart.

390
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,600
Just put the money down.

391
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,600
Let's go.

392
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:26,260
..

393
00:33:51,900 --> 00:34:01,900
Hey, you're good.

394
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:31,900
What?

395
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:32,900
Why are you taking off your clothes?

396
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:33,900
You can't get caught.

397
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:34,900
Who is it?

398
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:44,900
I'll go get you.

399
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:14,900
Hey!

400
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:44,900
Hit it faster and get out.

401
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:14,900
What are you doing?

402
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:44,900
What are you doing?

403
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:14,900
What are you doing?

404
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:44,900
What are you doing?

405
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:14,900
What are you doing?

406
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:44,900
What are you doing?

407
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:14,900
I'm sorry.

408
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:20,900
It's done.

409
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:21,900
It's all over.

410
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,900
Are you okay?

411
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:27,900
Are you okay?

412
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:33,900
Let's get this guy out of here.

413
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:39,900
Let's find him.

414
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:53,900
You look over there.

415
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,900
Hey, bro.

416
00:39:55,900 --> 00:40:03,900
Let's tie it up.

417
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,900
What's wrong with you?

418
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:06,900
I don't know. I fought.

419
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:07,900
Are you okay?

420
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,900
I think it's going to hurt a lot tomorrow.

421
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,900
But why did you tie this up?

422
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,900
I can untie it if I give it strength.

423
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,900
I don't think I can untie it.

424
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:16,900
Should I tie it up again?

425
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:17,900
Hurry up and tie it up.

426
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:24,900
Go get the cart.

427
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:25,900
Hold on.

428
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:26,900
It's done.

429
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:29,900
Let's go.

430
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:30,900
Oh, my clothes.

431
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:40,900
Hurry up.

432
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:45,900
I put a handcuff on here.

433
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,900
I think he tied it up and ran away.

434
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:58,900
You should've tied it up properly, Hyun-joo.

435
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:16,900
I'm late.

436
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,900
There's been a little problem.

437
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:19,900
Where's the money?

438
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:20,900
Don't worry about that.

439
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:22,900
The money's still there.

440
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,900
But where are you going?

441
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:25,900
I can't contact the body.

442
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,900
My face and mouth are badly torn.

443
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:31,900
I'm going to the scene first.

444
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,900
What's wrong with you?

445
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,900
You have to clean up what you've ruined.

446
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:36,900
Yes, that's right.

447
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,900
But my face is bleeding so much.

448
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,900
I'm going to the hospital because I'm shaking.

449
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,900
Hey, you punk.

450
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:46,900
Call the team leader and get the kids together.

451
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:48,900
I know all the kids.

452
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:51,900
You're going to get your ass kicked and die.

453
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:56,900
I'm going to get your neck first, you bastard.

454
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:57,900
Yes, sir.

455
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:07,900
Boss.

456
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:11,900
Yes, sir.

457
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:15,900
Let's go.

458
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:26,900
Hurry up and go.

459
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:42,900
Let's go.

460
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:45,900
Open the truck.

461
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:55,900
Push it.

462
00:42:55,900 --> 00:43:04,900
Be careful, be careful.

463
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:05,900
Let's go.

464
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:07,900
You have to get the gold.

465
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:08,900
Shouldn't we go quickly?

466
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:09,900
Go up first.

467
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:10,900
How much is it?

468
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:12,900
There's a few billion won.

469
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:13,900
I'll help you.

470
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:16,900
Hey, come up first.

471
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:18,900
Hey, what time is it?

472
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:19,900
You have to take care of that.

473
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:20,900
Start up and wait.

474
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:22,900
I'll be right up.

475
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:27,900
I have to hurry.

476
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:34,900
I have a bag under the chemist.

477
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:36,900
Fuck, gold bar?

478
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:45,900
Hurry up and take it.

479
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:46,900
Dollar?

480
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:49,900
Don't just stand there.

481
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:20,900
Oh, my God.

482
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:22,900
It's a lot.

483
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:26,900
Are you all right?

484
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:41,900
Follow me.

485
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:42,900
Let's find it, let's find it.

486
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:48,900
Why is the money going like this?

487
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:58,900
It's really heavy.

488
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:28,900
Call Gunwoo.

489
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:30,900
Yeah, bro.

490
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:32,900
Just follow me.

491
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:42,900
Yeah.

492
00:45:48,900 --> 00:46:17,900
Hey, can't you get out of there?

493
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,900
But I think the car is too heavy.

494
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:22,900
Then I'll hit the sign and get out.

495
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:28,900
Yeah, I'll try.

496
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:38,900
Hit it now and get out.

497
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:48,900
Oh, my God.

498
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:58,900
Oh, my God.

499
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:28,900
Hurry up and get in.

500
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:33,900
Hey, come on, come on, step on it.

501
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:43,900
The car is weird.

502
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:53,900
Oh, my God.

503
00:47:53,900 --> 00:48:21,900
Hey, hold on tight.

504
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:31,900
Are you all right?

505
00:48:51,900 --> 00:49:08,900
Oh, my God.

506
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:23,900
Push, push, push, push.

507
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:29,900
Hey.

508
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:34,900
Hey, push to the right.

509
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:45,900
Push, push, push, push, push.

510
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:52,900
Oh, my God.

511
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:54,900
Oh, my God.

512
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:56,900
The car is broken.

513
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:57,900
Get off.

514
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:06,900
You have to pack your bags.

515
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:11,900
Run.

516
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:21,900
Run.

517
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:35,900
Oh, my God.

518
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:40,900
Hey.

519
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:50,900
Hurry up and run.

520
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:20,900
Hey.

521
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:50,900
Hey.

522
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:20,900
Hey.

523
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:50,900
Hey.

524
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:20,900
Hey.

525
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:50,900
Hey.

526
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:20,900
Hey.
