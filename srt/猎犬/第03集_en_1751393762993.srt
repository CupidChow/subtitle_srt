00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
Live so that viewers don't have to be killed here

2
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:24,500
What the...

3
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,020
Who the hell are you guys?

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
What?

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,800
Come here, you bastard.

6
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,100
You bastard!

7
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,800
Darn it.

8
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,800
Let's go.

9
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,700
Let's call an ambulance.

10
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,500
Geon-woo, this is serious.

11
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,100
You'll die.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,200
Darn it.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,100
Hyun-joo, the homeless man was badly hurt.

14
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,200
So we called an ambulance.

15
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,500
What about Jae-myeong?

16
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,500
He ran away.

17
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,600
I told you not to come out.

18
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,300
But he was badly hurt.

19
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,900
So we had no choice.

20
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,100
He's not even my husband. Why would you come out?

21
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,200
But we didn't...

22
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,500
What should we do?

23
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,700
I'll call him.

24
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,400
What?

25
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,700
Hyun-joo.

26
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,600
I'm really sorry.

27
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,400
We're really sorry. Where are you?

28
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,400
I wanted to say sorry to you.

29
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,400
It's over.

30
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,600
Hyun-joo, please give me five minutes.

31
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,500
I'm really sorry.

32
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,100
I want to apologize.

33
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,300
Please give me five minutes.

34
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,400
Please.

35
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,600
I'll be right there.

36
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,000
I...

37
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,900
I honestly don't understand.

38
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,200
What?

39
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,600
If we stayed still,

40
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,800
the homeless man could have died.

41
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,200
You saw it too.

42
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,500
I know.

43
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,200
We did the right thing.

44
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,200
Why do we have to apologize to you?

45
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,900
Geon-woo, this is our first job.

46
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,400
It's hard for Hyun-joo to relate to this.

47
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,000
We're still in a situation

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
where we don't know each other.

49
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,800
If we apologize for things that we might misunderstand,

50
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,200
I think we can communicate.

51
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,200
But...

52
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,800
Geon-woo, I don't think you did anything wrong.

53
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,300
But from a work-related point of view,

54
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:14,200
I think we can solve this if we help each other.

55
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,800
Just once.

56
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,000
Okay?

57
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,400
Okay.

58
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,200
Ready.

59
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:28,800
Go!

60
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,300
Cut, cut.

61
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,100
Geon-woo!

62
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,200
Geon-woo!

63
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,200
Don't die!

64
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,800
I won't die!

65
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,400
Jun- assistant Manager Design

66
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,400
Keyboard- Controller figures

67
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,100
Orange team number four statements

68
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,100
Don't do it.

69
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,100
The baby will be over soon.

70
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,100
You fought with Yang Jae-myeong, didn't you?

71
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,100
It's a bit uncomfortable.

72
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:03,100
We can't work together.

73
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,100
Why?

74
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,100
Isn't it obvious?

75
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,100
We sincerely apologize.

76
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:13,100
Apologizing isn't important.

77
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,100
You showed your face to Yang Jae-myeong, didn't you?

78
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,100
Right?

79
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,100
I'm sorry.

80
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,100
I'm sorry.

81
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,100
Right?

82
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,100
I tried to gather clues by quietly stepping behind Yang Jae-myeong.

83
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,100
Now that Yang Jae-myeong knows someone is behind him, he'll be careful, right?

84
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,100
In other words, my plan is ruined.

85
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,100
He wore a hat and a mask, so he couldn't see his face.

86
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,100
Oh, you can't recognize him because you covered your face.

87
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,100
I can't recognize him because I can't see this stupid hair.

88
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:44,100
If it's me, I'll find out even if it's 100 meters away.

89
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,100
What are you doing?

90
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,100
Get out.

91
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,100
I apologized.

92
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,100
Get out of here.

93
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,100
I couldn't help it.

94
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,100
What's the situation?

95
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,100
We were just getting started, how can we do well?

96
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,100
That's why I said I didn't want to get started.

97
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,100
We're moving after seeing the situation.

98
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,100
What's the situation?

99
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,100
I called you earlier.

100
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,100
I can't understand what you're saying.

101
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,100
What the hell are you talking about?

102
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,100
I'll go out.

103
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,100
I'll go out, so don't yell.

104
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:11,100
I'll pay back the boss's salary somehow.

105
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:19,100
But I heard you and Hyun-joo yelling, so please listen to me.

106
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:35,100
I'll let you do what you do, so if you tell me to kill someone, I can kill him.

107
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,100
Smile Capital CEO drew with a knife.

108
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:45,100
If a person dies and stays still, I'm a worse guy than that CEO.

109
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:49,100
That's not it.

110
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:55,100
Think about it.

111
00:05:55,100 --> 00:06:05,100
I'm sorry.

112
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,100
I'll find you somewhere else.

113
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,100
Don't worry too much.

114
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,100
I'm sorry.

115
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,100
I couldn't stand it.

116
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,100
I held it better than I did.

117
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,100
You're hungry, right?

118
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,100
There's a hangover soup restaurant I know.

119
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,100
Let's go.

120
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,100
Oh, wait a minute.

121
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,100
I'm sorry.

122
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,100
I'm sorry.

123
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,100
I'm sorry.

124
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,100
I'm sorry.

125
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,100
I'm sorry.

126
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,100
I'm sorry.

127
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,100
I'm sorry.

128
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,100
I'm sorry.

129
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,100
I'm sorry.

130
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,100
I'm sorry.

131
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,100
I'm sorry.

132
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,100
I'm sorry.

133
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,100
Oh, wait a minute.

134
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,100
I closed the door because of Corona.

135
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:02,100
It's past 10 o'clock.

136
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,100
I just made you hungry.

137
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:09,100
I forgot.

138
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:12,100
I'm upset.

139
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:15,100
Hey, is it my fault that the restaurant closed because of Corona?

140
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:19,100
What you said is your fault.

141
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,100
Hey, you just couldn't stand it.

142
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,100
You said you held it in until just now.

143
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,100
That's because you're so miserable.

144
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:29,100
I'm not miserable.

145
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,100
I'm not miserable.

146
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,100
What are you doing?

147
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,100
I'm going to hit you.

148
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,100
I'm hungry.

149
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,100
I'm upset.

150
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:43,100
Wow, you're so ugly.

151
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,100
Why are you making a joke so harshly?

152
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,100
I'm not kidding.

153
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,100
I'm serious.

154
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,100
I was seriously hurt by this.

155
00:07:50,100 --> 00:08:00,100
Apologize.

156
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:03,100
Hey.

157
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,100
I knew this would happen.

158
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:15,100
I'm sorry.

159
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:44,100
Hey, hey, short, short, short.

160
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,100
It's so loud.

161
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:48,100
I'm going to hit you.

162
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,100
You're so annoying.

163
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,100
You're so annoying.

164
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,100
I'm going to hit you.

165
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,100
It's your turn.

166
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,100
Are you crazy?

167
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,100
I'm going to hit you.

168
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,100
It's so loud.

169
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,100
I'm going to hit you.

170
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,100
You're so annoying.

171
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,100
I'm going to hit you.

172
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,100
You're so annoying.

173
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,100
I'm going to hit you.

174
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,100
It's your turn.

175
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,100
Are you crazy?

176
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,100
I'm going to hit you.

177
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,100
You're so annoying.

178
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,100
You have to wear a mask.

179
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:12,100
Okay.

180
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,100
What is it?

181
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:18,100
Who's stepping behind us?

182
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,100
Who?

183
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:23,100
They're young kids, but I think they've been working out.

184
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,100
Are you sure?

185
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,100
Yes.

186
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:29,100
How can you be sure, you punk?

187
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,100
You're not focusing.

188
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,100
Well...

189
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,100
Tell me.

190
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:37,100
I borrowed money from the director before I worked.

191
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,100
They didn't ask for it, so I just went straight to it.

192
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,100
Tell me quickly.

193
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,100
He came to get money from you a while ago.

194
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,100
The guy who came to get money wore this red cat hat.

195
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:52,100
The guy who covered me today also wore the same hat.

196
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,100
Isn't it a coincidence?

197
00:09:55,100 --> 00:10:01,100
No, I'm the same.

198
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,100
Where's the money?

199
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,100
Let me explain the situation yesterday.

200
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:10,100
The fallen homeless grandfather had already been given a ID card from Yang Jae-myeong.

201
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:14,100
Yang Jae-myeong forgot about it and started a fight.

202
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:20,100
But how much do you get in loans with one of the stolen IDs?

203
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,100
Do you get a fine of 5,000 won?

204
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,100
If you take out 10 of the documents, you get 500 million won.

205
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,100
How long have you been doing this?

206
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,100
I think I've been doing it for at least half a year.

207
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,100
Wow, that's a lot of money.

208
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:38,100
But are the victims of the frauds still standing?

209
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,100
I can't do it because I'm going to be investigated if I report it to the police.

210
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:46,100
I'm trying to find it personally, but I don't think I can find it.

211
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,100
This is what I'm trying to do.

212
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:53,100
Find the private owners who were cheated on by Yang Jae-myeong and take the money Yang Jae-myeong borrowed and take care of the surgery.

213
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:57,100
It's going to be 3 billion won if I hit it.

214
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:05,100
You have to get this.

215
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:12,100
If the private owners are scammed, it's going to be harder for the people who borrowed money from the private owners.

216
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,100
What?

217
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,100
You have to bother people to fill in the money you lost.

218
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,100
Why?

219
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:24,100
I mean, I think the people who do the store are the most damaged.

220
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:34,100
That's true.

221
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:39,100
How did you find it?

222
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,100
How did you find it?

223
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:46,100
I don't know.

224
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:56,100
Turn off the lights and the signboard.

225
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:03,100
Turn off your phone first.

226
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:07,100
Is this the right place?

227
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,100
Are you sure?

228
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:18,100
Yes, I'm sure.

229
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,100
He borrowed money from the room.

230
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:41,100
The owner here said he used to do a lot of private property business.

231
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,100
You're not going to get away with this, are you?

232
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:53,100
Kick this.

233
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:57,100
Kick this.

234
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:06,100
Kick it quick, you punk.

235
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,100
Kick harder.

236
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,100
What?

237
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:13,100
You punk.

238
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,100
Yeah.

239
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,100
Yeah.

240
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:21,100
Kick harder.

241
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,100
All right.

242
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:28,100
This is going to cost a lot of money.

243
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:38,100
This is the basis.

244
00:13:53,100 --> 00:14:13,100
Did you check who was behind you when you came here last night?

245
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:16,100
I was on the bus.

246
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:19,100
You could have followed the bus.

247
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:25,100
If they stepped on us last night, why didn't they come right away?

248
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,100
Maybe they were trying to bring Kim Jun-min.

249
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,100
Oh, Hyun-joo.

250
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:31,100
Yang Jae-myeong saw us use our fists last night.

251
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:34,100
If they came to cover us, they would have brought more people.

252
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:37,100
They weren't sure either.

253
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:45,100
But now you might know something.

254
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:49,100
Anyway, it's important to find out how they found this place.

255
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,100
That way, we can prevent the same mistake.

256
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,100
Okay, I understand.

257
00:14:53,100 --> 00:15:04,100
Let's sit down and talk.

258
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,100
Do you know this place?

259
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:10,100
I've been here before.

260
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:15,100
I knew we were connected here.

261
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:25,100
Yeah.

262
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:30,100
Maybe they found Hyun-joo's hat.

263
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:39,100
Actually, I used to follow Hyun-joo chasing the homeless.

264
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:42,100
Yes, it's me.

265
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,100
The homeless man was Yang Jae-myeong.

266
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,100
Oh, my God.

267
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:51,100
I was wearing that hat back then, too.

268
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:55,100
Oh, yeah. I remember that hat.

269
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:58,100
Then you might have known.

270
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,100
But why did they kick the shutter?

271
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:05,100
Our shutter wasn't aluminum, it was made of steel.

272
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,100
I think I checked that.

273
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:11,100
I think they're coming back.

274
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:30,100
Why are you here?

275
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,100
What did you do?

276
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:36,100
I came here for that white car.

277
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:41,100
You're not going to tell me?

278
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,100
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

279
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:48,100
We went out to work last night.

280
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:53,100
What happened?

281
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,100
What happened?

282
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:59,100
Yang Jae-myeong was tailed.

283
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,100
Why?

284
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,100
Grandpa, as a homeless person,

285
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:05,100
Yang Jae-myeong is a bastard who has to be caught even if he pays.

286
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:08,100
He's the only one who can catch Yang Jae-myeong.

287
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,100
Why are you doing this for money?

288
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:13,100
It's good to make money.

289
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,100
What did you do?

290
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:20,100
It's my job to protect you.

291
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,100
I'm not hurt.

292
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:25,100
I'm disappointed.

293
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:28,100
I was disappointed in you, too.

294
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:31,100
I'm sure Yang Jae-myeong is doing something bad. Why don't you do anything?

295
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,100
If you ask Mr. Hwang, Yang Jae-myeong can be eliminated in an instant.

296
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,100
Are you frustrated?

297
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:39,100
I'm more frustrated.

298
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:42,100
Open your face.

299
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:49,100
Hurry up.

300
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:52,100
If Yang Jae-myeong and Kim Jun-min are individual bodyguards,

301
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,100
Individual bodyguards are like this brother.

302
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,100
People who are weak.

303
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:58,100
I have to threaten and squeeze them more.

304
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:02,100
Then it's useless for my grandfather to help people who don't have money.

305
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,100
Your grandfather's money is going into their pockets.

306
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,100
If you want to help the poor,

307
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:13,100
No matter how much you don't want to do it, you have to catch Yang Jae-myeong first.

308
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:17,100
Who did that to your face?

309
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:21,100
CEO of Smile Capital did.

310
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,100
What's your name?

311
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,100
I don't know your name.

312
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:38,100
There was a long knife mark on the left cheek.

313
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:48,100
You guys go in.

314
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:01,100
Boss, is this a coincidence?

315
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:04,100
Please find out who CEO of Smile Capital and Kim Byung-kyun are.

316
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:13,100
Yes.

317
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,100
Candy.

318
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,100
You're so short.

319
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:22,100
No, I said they were brothers earlier, and I felt good.

320
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,100
So?

321
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:27,100
So wouldn't it be okay to talk comfortably?

322
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,100
We're a team.

323
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,100
Isn't it a team if you don't talk?

324
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:36,100
I think it would be better if it was a family-like atmosphere, so I'm suggesting it.

325
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:39,100
If it's a family, the oldest person buys food.

326
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,100
Are you going to buy food?

327
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,100
I actually like honorifics.

328
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,100
I'm kidding.

329
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,100
Let's eat with your grandfather's card.

330
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,100
What do you want to eat?

331
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,100
Flower sirloin.

332
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:52,100
Then you buy it.

333
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,100
Meat buffet.

334
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,100
Meat buffet?

335
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,100
Yeah.

336
00:19:55,100 --> 00:20:00,100
There's a really good place.

337
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,100
Do you like it?

338
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:05,100
Let's go.

339
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,100
When did you start getting along with Gunwoo?

340
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:12,100
I don't think it's important that this person knows each other.

341
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,100
You're not really friends because you've known each other for a long time.

342
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,100
But?

343
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:20,100
What's really important is how similar you have lived.

344
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:25,100
So it's important to be able to understand each other even if we don't have a short conversation.

345
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,100
That's important.

346
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,100
That's how they get along?

347
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,100
Of course.

348
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:32,100
But our boxers have something to feel while being punched.

349
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,100
Wow, you've lived like this.

350
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,100
Bam.

351
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,100
I've lived like this, you punk.

352
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:46,100
The personality, heart, history of the player who punched each and every punch.

353
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,100
History.

354
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,100
History.

355
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:52,100
History.

356
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,100
You can see all this.

357
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,100
I know.

358
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,100
Yeah.

359
00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:03,100
And Gunwoo is a marine senior.

360
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,100
That tells you everything.

361
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:08,100
What are you telling me?

362
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,100
Everything.

363
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,100
What's everything?

364
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,100
Hyun-yu, I can't explain this no matter how much I explain it.

365
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,100
There's something only the marines can know.

366
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:22,100
When hip-hop artists say, this is hip-hop, it's similar to saying everything.

367
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,100
I can't describe this.

368
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:27,100
You can't describe it.

369
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,100
Are you a math major?

370
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,100
No way.

371
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,100
You're very.

372
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,100
Here.

373
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,100
Why didn't you turn on the lights?

374
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,100
You didn't say anything.

375
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,100
It's normal for a person sitting to turn on the lights.

376
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,100
I didn't know.

377
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,100
Then you should have turned it on.

378
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,100
How can I turn it on?

379
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,100
It's time to bring the meat, so I'll burn the whole plate.

380
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,100
How can you burn the iron?

381
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,100
Oh, it's not the iron that burns.

382
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:58,100
If the grill is too hot, the meat burns as soon as you put the meat on.

383
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,100
Then the meat burns.

384
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,100
Are you saying that the grill burns?

385
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:04,100
That's a professional English and I'm a civilian.

386
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,100
My mom says the grill burns.

387
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,100
My mom doesn't.

388
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,100
Hey, then the guy who knows the meat.

389
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,100
Done.

390
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,100
Put it on.

391
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:16,100
No, you can't put the meat on when the grill is unheated.

392
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,100
Then it won't taste good.

393
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,100
You have to wait.

394
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:24,100
Shall we talk while the grill is heating up?

395
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:28,100
You can just talk naturally.

396
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,100
Is it your boss and family?

397
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,100
Huh?

398
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,100
Why are you so quick?

399
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:36,100
Honestly, I was curious from the beginning.

400
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:43,100
In short, I got a stroke when I was eight.

401
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:51,100
I got out of the hospital when I was ten, but my dad died.

402
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:58,100
So I went to the orphanage, but I ran away because I hated it.

403
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:05,100
But I was so hungry that I couldn't eat anything.

404
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:13,100
I secretly ate the leftover jajangmyeon that others had put out in front of the door and worked at a bar with the kids who were on the run.

405
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,100
It was so hard.

406
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:21,100
So I went back to the orphanage.

407
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:27,100
I was taken to a new orphanage when I was 17, and my grandfather was the owner of the orphanage.

408
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,100
Your boss?

409
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,100
Yeah.

410
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:34,100
He wanted to do something good, so he built a orphanage.

411
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:44,100
He was so nice to me, so I thought he was a pervert at first, but I found out after a while.

412
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,100
I was just serious.

413
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:51,100
My grandfather made me do everything I couldn't learn because I didn't have any money.

414
00:23:51,100 --> 00:24:01,100
I learned how to use a sword and how to use a motorcycle.

415
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:05,100
I can feel that you're a really good person.

416
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:10,100
I've been working with my mom since I was in middle school and paid my dad's debt.

417
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:15,100
But when I suddenly got 100 million, I was really dark.

418
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:18,100
I know how scary 100 million is.

419
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:23,100
When my boss gave me money to pay off my debt, I thought about it.

420
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:28,100
I have to protect him no matter what.

421
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:34,100
My grandfather said, if you want to see the depth of a person, open your heart wide.

422
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:38,100
The person with the depth will know how to understand and pay back.

423
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:42,100
The person without it will try to use it.

424
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,100
That's right.

425
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:45,100
You're nice.

426
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:48,100
I'm confident in being kind and sincere.

427
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,100
I can put this on the meat.

428
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:59,100
Yeah.

429
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:02,100
The timing is very good.

430
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,100
You know how to do it, too.

431
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,100
I learned it from you.

432
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:09,100
Why are you two playing with me while talking to me?

433
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,100
Oh, it's done.

434
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,100
Turn it over quickly.

435
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,100
No.

436
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,100
Trust him.

437
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,100
Trust me.

438
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:17,100
I can't get used to this.

439
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,100
Slowly.

440
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:24,100
Oh, it smells good.

441
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,100
Let's use up all the buffet today.

442
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,100
Good.

443
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,100
When are you going to eat?

444
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,100
I'll come tomorrow morning.

445
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,100
Does it hurt?

446
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,100
It's bearable.

447
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:34,100
I told you it was warm.

448
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,100
It's supposed to be cold in winter.

449
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,100
Oh, really.

450
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,100
Hyun-joo.

451
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,100
Yeah.

452
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,100
I know where the book store is.

453
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:45,100
What should I do?

454
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:48,100
I'll talk to my grandfather.

455
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,100
Ask him quickly.

456
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,100
I don't have time.

457
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:53,100
Okay.

458
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,100
Team leader.

459
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:57,100
The lobby is the first impression of the hotel.

460
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:02,100
I want you to have the most Korean and beautiful and grand impression on foreign guests.

461
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:05,100
I've never experienced it before.

462
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,100
Yes, sir.

463
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:11,100
Anyway, I'll look forward to your good opinion at the meeting tomorrow morning.

464
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:15,100
Our casino is located at the top of the hotel.

465
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:18,100
My goal is to make a year-end sale.

466
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:23,100
There are a lot of people who can't run away from Macau because of Corona.

467
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:29,100
We'll make a secret reservation for the suite room every week and make it fun.

468
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:32,100
I'm going to take a picture of you running away.

469
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:42,100
When we have enough cash, we'll hand over illegal evidence to the police.

470
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:58,100
If the hotel is ruined and we get paid, we'll eat the whole hotel.

471
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:03,100
If Jang Do-gwang comes to make a drug store, he has to prepare a thousand.

472
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:06,100
I'm going to make about 500.

473
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,100
Yes, sir.

474
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:11,100
Collect all our money out there.

475
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:23,100
Sell everything that's worth money.

476
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,100
Yes, sir.

477
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:27,100
Yes, the car you mentioned earlier is here.

478
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,100
Yes.

479
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:42,100
I'll be back, sir.

480
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:52,100
What is it?

481
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:55,100
Excuse me.

482
00:27:55,100 --> 00:28:05,100
What the hell.

483
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:13,100
Get off me.

484
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:23,100
Get off me.

485
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:35,100
What are you doing?

486
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:45,100
Get off me.

487
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,100
Oh, yes.

488
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,100
It's this way.

489
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,100
Are you going in well?

490
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,100
Yes, yes.

491
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:52,100
You've had a hard time.

492
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,100
Try it.

493
00:28:53,100 --> 00:29:02,100
Thank you.

494
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:05,100
You did it very well.

495
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:10,100
It's so cold, can't you give me some clothes?

496
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:16,100
I'm sorry.

497
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:21,100
Hi.

498
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,100
You.

499
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,100
It's you, right?

500
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:28,100
Oh, my God.

501
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:35,100
You're pretending to be your own.

502
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:39,100
So why are you being so mean to the CEO?

503
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:43,100
If you're a real cop, our leader is scared.

504
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:54,100
You're going to make an accident.

505
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:58,100
I'll teach you one thing.

506
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:04,100
If you hit the beast, bite it.

507
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:08,100
It doesn't matter if it's stronger or weaker than you.

508
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:18,100
Just bite it.

509
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:23,100
Come on.

510
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,100
Take it off.

511
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,100
Yes.

512
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:29,100
Take off all your underwear.

513
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:32,100
Please let me go.

514
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,100
I'm sorry.

515
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,100
I don't know what it is.

516
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,100
Hey, Im Bok.

517
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:43,100
Please give me a hug.

518
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:53,100
Take it off.

519
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:59,100
Take it off or not.

520
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:06,100
Then drink more.

521
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:16,100
Take it off or not.

522
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:19,100
Take it off.

523
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:26,100
Take it off.

524
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,100
You thought well.

525
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:38,100
Let's see our CEO Song already.

526
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:08,100
I'm sorry.

527
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:18,100
I'm sorry.

528
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:28,100
Yes.

529
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:35,100
Boss, the CEO of Smile Capital is Kim Myung-gil we know.

530
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,100
I see.

531
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,100
I'm on my way to pick him up.

532
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,100
I'll be there soon.

533
00:32:40,100 --> 00:33:03,100
Yes.

534
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:08,100
I'm sorry it happened all of a sudden.

535
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:13,100
I've been through a lot of things recently.

536
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:18,100
I decided after a lot of thought, so I believe you'll understand.

537
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:23,100
Our company will close at the end of this month.

538
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:31,100
I'm going to pay the rent and pay the monthly salary for a year.

539
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,100
Everyone did a good job.

540
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:36,100
Boss, we...

541
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:39,100
What about the money that's out there?

542
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:49,100
I'll take care of it.

543
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:11,100
Dad...

544
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:21,100
Dad...

545
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:31,100
Yes.

546
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:33,100
I'm Oh In-muk from the police station.

547
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:35,100
I think I was a thief in the office.

548
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:43,100
How many?

549
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:53,100
I think it's two.

550
00:34:53,100 --> 00:35:03,100
I'm sorry.

551
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:09,100
Hey!

552
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:12,100
I heard it'll be done in 10 minutes.

553
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:16,100
This model is originally a combination of six passwords and a password, but this is eight.

554
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:19,100
I think it's been remodeled to four.

555
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,100
What do you want me to do?

556
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,100
Just a little more.

557
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:32,100
Finish it quickly.

558
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:42,100
It's done.

559
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:52,100
Come out.

560
00:35:52,100 --> 00:36:02,100
Come out.

561
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:12,100
One of the first 10 billion won in this loan is 100 million won.

562
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:17,100
I'm not going out.

563
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:21,100
I got the elevator.

564
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,100
Yes.

565
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:25,100
Should I go up with you?

566
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:29,100
No, thank you.

567
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:37,100
I'll borrow this.

568
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:47,100
I'll borrow this.

569
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:17,100
What's this?

570
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:27,100
How did you get in?

571
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:37,100
I'm sorry.

572
00:37:57,100 --> 00:38:07,100
Who sent you?

573
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:17,100
Who sent you?

574
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:27,100
Who sent you?

575
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:35,100
Who sent you?

576
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:45,100
Who sent you?

577
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:15,100
Who sent you?

578
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:45,100
Who sent you?

579
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:15,100
Who sent you?

580
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:25,100
Who sent you?

581
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:35,100
Who sent you?

582
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:45,100
Kill me.

583
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:15,100
Are you okay, Heo?

584
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:19,100
Wake up.

585
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:21,100
Heo.

586
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,100
Wake up.

587
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:24,100
Kang In-seong!

588
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:26,100
You don't have time?

589
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,100
I'm here.

590
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:36,100
You take everything from the safe and go down first.

591
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,100
Wake up.

592
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:47,100
Wake up.

593
00:41:56,100 --> 00:42:06,100
Wake up.

594
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,100
Brother.

595
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:25,100
He's gone.

596
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:35,100
Let's go in.

597
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:45,100
Boss.

598
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:15,100
Let's go.

599
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:25,100
Did you think about it?

600
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:28,100
What's the problem?

601
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:31,100
Let's avoid Yang Jae-myeong.

602
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:33,100
Why?

603
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:35,100
They kill people.

604
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:37,100
Let's move the book room.

605
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:38,100
Why?

606
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:43,100
Hyun-jae.

607
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:48,100
Look at me.

608
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:50,100
I'm tired of you.

609
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:56,100
I don't have the courage to fight them.

610
00:43:56,100 --> 00:44:01,100
I want to teach you for the rest of my life.

611
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:05,100
I want to give you what you want to give you.

612
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:10,100
I want to live peacefully.

613
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:17,100
That's my only wish.

614
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:25,100
Can you do that?

615
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:35,100
Thank you.

616
00:44:55,100 --> 00:45:05,100
I'm sorry.

617
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:35,100
I'm sorry.

618
00:45:55,100 --> 00:46:05,100
I'm sorry.

619
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:35,100
I'll go to bed.

620
00:46:55,100 --> 00:47:05,100
I'm sorry.

621
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:15,100
I'm sorry.

622
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:20,100
Bbom.

623
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:22,100
Brother.

624
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:32,100
Come on in.

625
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:35,100
How is it?

626
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:42,100
It's cool.

627
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:44,100
One is 500 million.

628
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:52,100
If our business breaks down in Korea, you and I will take this and go straight to Vietnam.

629
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:57,100
I have a plant in the Vietnamese government.

630
00:47:57,100 --> 00:48:04,100
This way, we can live like kings for the rest of our lives.

631
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:10,100
Thank you, brother.

632
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:12,100
You're my brother.

633
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:16,100
What can't I do for you?

634
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:20,100
Bbom.

635
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:24,100
You're the only one I have.

636
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:34,100
You're not, are you?

637
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:37,100
Stir-fried spicy pork here is the best in the world.

638
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:38,100
In the world?

639
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:48,100
Yeah.

640
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:50,100
Bbom.

641
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:56,100
Bbom.

642
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:58,100
I'm Woojin.

643
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:01,100
Woojin, Woojin.

644
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:04,100
What happened?

645
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:07,100
I borrowed money from my cousin.

646
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:13,100
I don't have money to buy a new one.

647
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:18,100
I'm scared.

648
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:28,100
What should I do?

649
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:46,100
Please be quiet and do your job.

650
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:47,100
Do you understand?

651
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:57,100
Okay.

652
00:49:57,100 --> 00:50:00,100
CEO Lim.

653
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:02,100
He used to work with me.

654
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:05,100
He was cheated on by someone who lent him 500 million.

655
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:06,100
Isn't it Yang Jae-myeong?

656
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:07,100
I don't know.

657
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:09,100
I didn't ask him in detail.

658
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:12,100
He was a homeless man and a fake criminal.

659
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:14,100
He's got the same method.

660
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:16,100
That's right.

661
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:19,100
Let's catch him.

662
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:22,100
I've been through it. How can I stay still?

663
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:24,100
Grandpa told me not to come out.

664
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:26,100
They're really dangerous guys.

665
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:29,100
But I don't think you're staying still when you see it.

666
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:31,100
Or should I tell Yang Jae-myeong about the brother who just called?

667
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:33,100
You want me to catch him?

668
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:36,100
If you're going to catch him, let's catch him and hand him over.

669
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:38,100
If you do well, you can make money.

670
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:41,100
If you really make money, can I help you?

671
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:43,100
I'll give you a quarter of the money.

672
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:45,100
Take it and do whatever you want.

673
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:46,100
Okay.

674
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:51,100
Then I'll help you, too.

675
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:56,100
Come here.

676
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:57,100
Come here.

677
00:50:57,100 --> 00:51:01,100
Thanks.

678
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:06,100
Thanks.

679
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:21,100
Okay.

680
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:26,100
I'll go.

681
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:36,100
Brother, what's this?

682
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:38,100
It's over there.

683
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:44,100
The engine is off, but no one's coming down.

684
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:45,100
Jun-dae.

685
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:47,100
Yeah.

686
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:48,100
Check your cell phone.

687
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:53,100
Okay.

688
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:59,100
Yes, sir. It's up.

689
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:08,100
Move as I said in two hours.

690
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:28,100
Where is it?

691
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:37,100
Let's go.

692
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:47,100
You're dead today, you bastards.

693
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:17,100
Let's go.

694
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:39,100
Yes, sir.

695
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:49,100
Come down.

696
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:59,100
Let go.

697
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:00,100
Let go.

698
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:05,100
You bastards, come out quickly because you know you're there.

699
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:07,100
Come out, you bastard.

700
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:15,100
Are you playing hide and seek?

701
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:17,100
Please take it.

702
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:25,100
Please.

703
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:28,100
Please take it.

704
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:36,100
Please.

705
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:39,100
Grandpa, the brothers are in danger.

706
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:41,100
Where?

707
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:42,100
Run, run, run.

708
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:44,100
Go, go, go.

709
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:45,100
You bastards.

710
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:50,100
Run, run, run.

711
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:52,100
Go, go, go.

712
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:54,100
Run, run, run.

713
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:56,100
You bastards.

714
00:54:56,100 --> 00:55:02,100
Run, run, run.

715
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:12,100
Are you okay?

716
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:42,100
Run, run, run.

717
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:12,100
Run, run, run.

718
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:42,100
Run, run, run.

719
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:42,100
Run, run, run.

720
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:12,100
Run, run, run.

721
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:42,100
Run, run, run.
