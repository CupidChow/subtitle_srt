00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,140
Please visit our channel!

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'll be right there.

3
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,520
You can't lose your mind.

4
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:53,520
Open your eyes.

5
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Oh, thank you.

6
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,920
試� 살짝

7
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,920
Mom,

8
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:29,940
Oh...

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:39,700
I'm sorry...

10
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:45,700
Well...

11
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:56,020
Let's go.

12
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm so glad you didn't get hurt.

13
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You're not going to remove the scar?

14
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
This is a suture.

15
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
If you don't want to leave a scar,

16
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
it's best to do the surgery as soon as possible.

17
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It must be expensive.

18
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I can introduce it to you.

19
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
If you look at the recent surgery photos,

20
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
you can see the scar on the left forehead.

21
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's a scar that's been removed.

22
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's a scar that's been removed.

23
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
This is a picture before the surgery.

24
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
This is a picture after the laser surgery.

25
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's a face.

26
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I think it's better to do the surgery when you're young.

27
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
No, it's okay. Thank you.

28
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Choi Young-jung, are you there?

29
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Yes, please come in.

30
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Are you okay?

31
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Look.

32
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Look.

33
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
How many times did you bite?

34
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
30 times.

35
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You're so annoying.

36
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Let's report it.

37
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
If you report it, your mom will die.

38
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
But...

39
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Why?

40
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Mom could be in danger.

41
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Oh, my God.

42
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
What about the contract?

43
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I've never seen a loan extension surgery before.

44
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I pay 10% of the original money every month until I pay the loan.

45
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
My mom's loan is 5,000 won, but the surgery fee is 500 won.

46
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
If you don't pay the surgery fee, it'll double.

47
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
The interest rate goes up from 5% to 20%.

48
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
These guys wrote it down so they wouldn't forget it.

49
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
This is fraud.

50
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I can't help it.

51
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
What should I do?

52
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You have to pay it back.

53
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
The interest rate is 100 million won a month.

54
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
The house is also a mortgage.

55
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I don't have money.

56
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Oh, my God.

57
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Let's eat first.

58
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'll buy you something. What do you want to eat?

59
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Braised pork?

60
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Are you in the mood to joke?

61
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I really want to eat.

62
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Okay.

63
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'll buy you delicious stir-fried pork like braised pork.

64
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Bye.

65
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You have to come after I finish exercising.

66
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's just a course. It's a perfect course.

67
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Don't just stand there and eat.

68
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Okay?

69
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Okay.

70
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Oh, my God.

71
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Give me two pork.

72
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Okay.

73
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I've never seen it before.

74
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
He's a friend who's boxing with me.

75
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Really?

76
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'll be right back.

77
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Okay.

78
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Yes, brother.

79
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Yes, brother.

80
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm Woojin.

81
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
How are you?

82
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Oh, it's not clean.

83
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Oh, Gunwoo.

84
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I took care of your contract.

85
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I don't think they're professional scammers.

86
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I'm sorry.

87
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm sorry.

88
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'm sorry.

89
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I lost my contract, but they're professional scammers.

90
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I can't help it.

91
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's not my fault.

92
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Thank you, son.

93
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
How's your face?

94
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Yeah, he's holding it well.

95
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Oh, that's a relief.

96
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Mom, I'll clean the cafe later with my brother.

97
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Mom, take a rest at home today.

98
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
No, no, no.

99
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'll clean it up. Just leave it.

100
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
No, I'll do it later.

101
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It's almost done.

102
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Mom, I'll call you when I get home.

103
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Oh, yeah.

104
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Yeah.

105
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'd like to ask you a favor.

106
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I have a younger brother.

107
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I'll get the interest and loan and give it to you.

108
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'll make sure there's no problem.

109
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I can get this from somewhere else.

110
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Please give me a minute.

111
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'm begging you. Just once.

112
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I really care about my brother.

113
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Please help me.

114
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Do you know how much I got from the US military?

115
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I just did it for you.

116
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm sorry.

117
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Why didn't you tell me?

118
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I just got out.

119
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Try it.

120
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It's the best Korean spicy stir-fried pork.

121
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Right?

122
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Yeah.

123
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Let's eat.

124
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
He's a little picky, so it's okay.

125
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'll tell you.

126
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Manager Seo.

127
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Manager Seo.

128
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Yes.

129
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
How much is this?

130
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'm going to do that for about two times.

131
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Brother, Woojin is here.

132
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You've been missing for years.

133
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
If you suddenly come to me,

134
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Will I die?

135
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'm sorry.

136
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Sit down.

137
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Sit down.

138
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
So what did your brother say?

139
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I got caught by the bastard.

140
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Smile Capital.

141
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Smile Capital?

142
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
The one in Ganghwando?

143
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I don't know the location.

144
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Oh, my God.

145
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Smile Capital is not a bastard.

146
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It's a big company.

147
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
How much did you borrow?

148
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
One page.

149
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Wow.

150
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I'm screwed.

151
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
So help me.

152
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You're getting rich.

153
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'll give you a year's worth of 100 million won.

154
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Thank you.

155
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You can work under me like you used to.

156
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Thanks to Corona, our company is the best.

157
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Let's pull it tight and build a building.

158
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Look at the work.

159
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'll give you a bonus as soon as you ask.

160
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
All of a sudden?

161
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Let's play the hunting game with me for a year.

162
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
This is an opportunity.

163
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It's an opportunity to make more money.

164
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
When will you ever touch this big money?

165
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I know what you mean.

166
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
All of a sudden?

167
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Let's decide.

168
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Let's go.

169
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
What if we get a job?

170
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
We're hitting people who are weak to make money.

171
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
We're the gangsters.

172
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
We're boxers.

173
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Hey, bro.

174
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
If you can't get the money to Smile Capital, you're really dead.

175
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You're gonna get all the electricity?

176
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
What are you doing?

177
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Thank you, bro. I'll come again.

178
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Let's go.

179
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
What the hell are you doing?

180
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Are you kidding me?

181
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'm just kidding.

182
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
See you again.

183
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Let's go.

184
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Hey, box.

185
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Take a picture.

186
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
If the business goes well, please take off your clothes.

187
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Thank you so much.

188
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Thank you so much.

189
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Thank you.

190
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Let's go.

191
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Let's go.

192
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Excuse me.

193
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Is there a problem?

194
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Yes, there is.

195
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
And this is the money for today.

196
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I'm looking for a homeless person who goes around in many places.

197
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Who are you?

198
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I'm looking for a homeless person who goes around in many places.

199
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I'll do my best to get the money as soon as possible.

200
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Can you do it until this week?

201
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'll make it by this week.

202
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I'll do my best.

203
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
You've been waiting for a long time.

204
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Why are you taking off your mask?

205
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I'll use it again.

206
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I'm not asking you to use it again. Why did you take it off?

207
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I've been waiting for over 30 minutes.

208
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I took it off because I was frustrated.

209
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
How can a man who is so impatient protect other people?

210
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
What does it have to do with the mask and protecting people?

211
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Get out.

212
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Go away.

213
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
That bastard.

214
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
You were taking off your mask, right?

215
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
No, I saw it.

216
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I wasn't taking it off, I was getting off.

217
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
If you didn't use it, you took it off.

218
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
You're being cowardly.

219
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Get out.

220
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I'm not going out.

221
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Oh, my God.

222
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Oh, my God.

223
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Oh, my God.

224
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Oh, my God.

225
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Put down your mask.

226
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
What's your name?

227
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I'm Dongho Chun.

228
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
What's your height?

229
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
187cm and 74kg.

230
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
What did you do for exercise?

231
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I've been doing kickboxing for 10 years.

232
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
What's your major?

233
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I graduated from Yongwon University.

234
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Oh, my God.

235
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
What about the army?

236
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I got an exemption.

237
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I was playing soccer and my cross-strait broke.

238
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Let's see next time.

239
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Can I ask why you're doing this?

240
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I'm looking for a marine.

241
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
How much is a marine?

242
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

243
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Then you should have used the notice seriously.

244
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Wait a minute.

245
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Oh, C?

246
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I'm the only one who's wasting time.

247
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
You can't do that in front of an adult.

248
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
You're an adult and a fool.

249
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
You can't do that.

250
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
See you next time.

251
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Yes.

252
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I'm sorry.

253
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Run.

254
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Why are you running all of a sudden?

255
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
It's 734.

256
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:36,000
There's only one person in Korea who can move a trillion won in a single call.

257
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Chairman Bang Sung-woo.

258
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
And there's only one person who knows the face of Chairman Bang.

259
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I'm just one person.

260
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Stay still.

261
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
The only person that the legendary Chairman Bang trusted and raised is Mr. Choi.

262
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
And since Mr. Choi is here, I can eat and live on this floor.

263
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I understand this worldview.

264
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Okay.

265
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Good.

266
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Mr. Choi is looking for people right now.

267
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:16,000
He said he wanted to have at least a little knowledge of our business, which is extremely great, and he could risk his life to protect people at any moment.

268
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
So I've been meeting people since yesterday.

269
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
All of them are not good.

270
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
At that time, our junior marine gave me a call.

271
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It's an amazing timing.

272
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
My brother is a marine, too.

273
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
He's older than me.

274
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
How many?

275
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
1,207.

276
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I'm 734.

277
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Great.

278
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I'm going to give you two marines a special recommendation, so write down your resident number here.

279
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Actually, we needed a loan, so we called you.

280
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
That's why I'm telling you to find the boss.

281
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
He's like a tiger in Baekdu Mountain, but he's really, really generous and generous.

282
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Once you admit yourself as a person, you're a real marine who takes responsibility until the end.

283
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Are you a senior?

284
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Is the CEO a marine?

285
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Yes.

286
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I think he was exempted from middle school.

287
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Oh, like hip-hop people saying this is hip-hop, that's hip-hop, you just said it symbolically.

288
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
What are you saying?

289
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Write down your resident number.

290
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Yes.

291
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I saw your face, but I don't think it's bad.

292
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I think it's going to work out.

293
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Thank you.

294
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Let's go.

295
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
What are you saying?

296
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Hey, how many people did you fight with?

297
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Ten people?

298
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
But I got hit by one person.

299
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
One person?

300
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
He was very big, but he got caught and hit hard.

301
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
It's not hard to hit.

302
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I think it's a little hard to hit.

303
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I think it's a little hard to hit.

304
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I think it's a little hard to hit.

305
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I'm going to eat everything.

306
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Hey, what if you're going to run a hunting dog instead of paying your mother's debt?

307
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Let's think about it together.

308
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
You're a great doorkeeper.

309
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Yes, thank you.

310
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
No, no, no, no, no, we'll take care of that.

311
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Director Oh knows that very well.

312
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Yeah, let's just eat half of the food that Yang Joong-yoon gave us.

313
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Yeah.

314
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Yang Jaemyeong went around Chungjeongno and Myeongdong today and borrowed 400 million won from seven private companies.

315
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
How did you get out?

316
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I handed it over to the director of a company called Small Capital in Ganghwando.

317
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Do you know?

318
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Of course.

319
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Yang Jaemyeong made a ghost criminal without a name under the name of a homeless person and borrowed money from private companies.

320
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Private companies don't share information with each other and they don't know the law of the water, so they get hit.

321
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
You know you were fooled by the company for money, right?

322
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
It was designed by someone who knew the flow of money.

323
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Yang Jaemyeong is just a front-runner.

324
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
How do you know?

325
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
2001?

326
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
2002?

327
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:43,000
The disabled were pretending to be self-sufficient at the facility and gave them ID cards.

328
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:51,000
They made a ghost criminal and borrowed more than 7 billion won from the private companies in Myeongdong with their bank accounts.

329
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
They ran away to the Philippines.

330
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
How much money do you have now?

331
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Are we going to stay still?

332
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Huh?

333
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
The private companies are working.

334
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
In a way, there are my grandparents and juniors.

335
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
They'll take care of it themselves.

336
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
The private companies can't report to the police.

337
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Hyunjoo, this is a problem that they have to solve themselves.

338
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I'm a person who doesn't exist in the world.

339
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I've lived like that for 10 years.

340
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Then what happened to the person who went to the Philippines?

341
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Did you catch him?

342
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,000
The people who took the money from that friend gathered the hunters and sent them to the Philippines.

343
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Is he dead?

344
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
It's cruel.

345
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Hyunjoo, what if I put someone who works with you on it?

346
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
No.

347
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
It's dangerous. You could get hurt.

348
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I got scratched.

349
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
But it's still the same.

350
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
It's faster to walk alone.

351
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Good night.

352
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Hey, you punk.

353
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Oh, nice.

354
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Why did you do that to my face?

355
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Who said that?

356
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I asked this body.

357
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Did the culprit say that?

358
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Well, do it to me.

359
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Just this.

360
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Oh, good. Good shot.

361
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I spat on my face when the kids were all there.

362
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I just showed you the showcase.

363
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
There are the most people who go out themselves.

364
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Changdo, you should go out when you have to.

365
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
That's what kids are afraid of.

366
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Yes.

367
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
By the way, why haven't you contacted the report yet?

368
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
It's been over a week.

369
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I'll talk to Park and make a seat quickly.

370
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
It's your fault, right?

371
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Let's do that.

372
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Park's House

373
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
You've made a good body.

374
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Didn't you fight in the old days?

375
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I'm an amateur.

376
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
You look very diligent.

377
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
You don't lie.

378
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
That's right.

379
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,000
But I don't know anything about the dead body.

380
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I'm a friend who goes around with Kim Gunwoo these days.

381
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:10,320
I heard about the

382
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I'll just look at the guy named Gunwoo.

383
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Yes.

384
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Oh, there it is.

385
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Hello.

386
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Hello.

387
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
You came through the headquarters, right?

388
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Yes.

389
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Go in this way.

390
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Go in.

391
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Yes.

392
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Hello.

393
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I'm Kim Gunwoo.

394
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Sit down.

395
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Yes.

396
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I'm a little comfortable.

397
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I'm sorry.

398
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I'm sorry.

399
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I'm sorry.

400
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I'm sorry.

401
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I'm sorry.

402
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I'm sorry.

403
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I'm sorry.

404
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I'm sorry.

405
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Can I talk comfortably?

406
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Yes.

407
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Did you get hurt on your face?

408
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
The private workers broke my mother's cafe and stopped it.

409
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I used to be a dead body.

410
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
It's been a while since I quit.

411
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Yes.

412
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I'm sick now, so I can't get treatment.

413
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I borrowed money without interest.

414
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Yes.

415
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I'm looking for people.

416
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I have a young friend who is learning to work for me.

417
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Yes.

418
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Not a bloodline.

419
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
It's the only family I have.

420
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Yes.

421
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I'm worried that he might get hurt while he's alone.

422
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
So I want a good person to protect me.

423
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Then it's not a job.

424
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
It's not a job.

425
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
It's a guard.

426
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Yes.

427
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
It could be bad.

428
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I talked to Gunwoo.

429
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
He's not in a bad mood.

430
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I heard that he lived hard without losing his good heart in this difficult environment.

431
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I met him in person, and his eyes are strong.

432
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Do you trust me?

433
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Thank you.

434
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Why did you start boxing?

435
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I wanted to be strong when I was young.

436
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Why?

437
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
My father was a person who couldn't drink.

438
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,000
When I was in the first grade of middle school, my house was getting a little difficult, so he drank and hit his mother.

439
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
I wanted to be strong in my young mind while watching that.

440
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
You live together.

441
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
No.

442
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I was divorced when I was in the third grade of middle school.

443
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I couldn't see you after that.

444
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I'm a countryman.

445
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Yes.

446
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
My father was a small farm.

447
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Yes.

448
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I remember very vividly when I was 10 years old.

449
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
He came to the prison and ruined his farm.

450
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I can't pay the rent, so I ordered the land owner to do it.

451
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
In front of the villagers,

452
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I hit my father.

453
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:34,000
My father was seriously injured in his head, but he couldn't go to the hospital because he didn't have money.

454
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
He died while resting at home.

455
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
That's why I decided to make money without working.

456
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I thought I'd help people who couldn't get treatment because they didn't have money.

457
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:04,000
We're in a difficult situation, but let's overcome it with a good heart.

458
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
That's what I'm saying.

459
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Yes.

460
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I always have a good heart.

461
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
You're out of words.

462
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Yes.

463
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I'm sorry. I'm not good at talking.

464
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Oh, really?

465
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Yes.

466
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
How was it?

467
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I think I did a good job.

468
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I was glad to hear that the boss talked a lot.

469
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Thank you. I was doing my best.

470
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
How was it?

471
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
He's definitely not funny.

472
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
But he's a good guy.

473
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Be careful.

474
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I think he's in a hurry.

475
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Please solve it within today.

476
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Just a little bit.

477
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Eat a lot.

478
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Eat deliciously without tea.

479
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Mother, I really like kimchi stew.

480
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
It's hot.

481
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
It's so delicious.

482
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Thank you for the meal.

483
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Enjoy your meal.

484
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
I don't know how reliable you are for helping me this time.

485
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
No, you're my younger brother.

486
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
You'll solve the problem well.

487
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Thank you.

488
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Thank you.

489
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Eat quickly.

490
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Thank you for the meal.

491
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Eat a lot.

492
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I'm out.

493
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Who is it?

494
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Who?

495
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
I'm the one who's taking Mr. Choi.

496
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Hello.

497
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I'm Lee Rok.

498
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Pardon?

499
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
You said it's a gift for your second year's salary.

500
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I'll go to work at 10 tomorrow morning and send you the address of the office by text.

501
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Thank you.

502
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Thank you so much.

503
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
You should be thankful to Mr. Choi.

504
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I'll go now.

505
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Thank you.

506
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
It's so delicious.

507
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I'll make more for you.

508
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Who is it?

509
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I actually got a job through someone I know.

510
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
What?

511
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I'm working as a guard for the owner of a very rich family.

512
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:49,000
But the owner took good care of me, so I gave him 100 million won as his second-year salary.

513
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Really?

514
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Let's pay the debt first.

515
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
So that it won't increase.

516
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I think I ruined your dream.

517
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
No, mom.

518
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
I think it's most important to live happily with you.

519
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,000
You can work hard and work out after COVID-19.

520
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
It's okay.

521
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I'm so sorry.

522
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Let's laugh, mom.

523
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
It's a good thing.

524
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Thank you.

525
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
What?

526
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
The guest came 20 minutes ago.

527
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
You're early.

528
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
He's the son of the I-group, right?

529
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
You know?

530
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Be careful.

531
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Why?

532
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Here.

533
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Yes.

534
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Give me some wet wipes.

535
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I'm sorry, I don't come here even if I press the bell several times.

536
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I'll pay you back quickly.

537
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
When I was doing the baby talk at Speed, he had a fight with Wang Won-hee.

538
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Hyun-ji?

539
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Yes.

540
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
We had a fight after drinking and talking about politics.

541
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
A few days later, he came in as a new employee.

542
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
He even sold his house because he was hit by a tax bomb.

543
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Later, I found out that there was no one in their family.

544
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
National Intelligence Agency, gold family, police agency.

545
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
They have a family everywhere.

546
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
That's how rich people are.

547
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Really?

548
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Hyun-ji may be a family of a political person who cursed.

549
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Oh, I'm just worried about you.

550
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Okay.

551
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Did you set up the pretty girls?

552
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I heard not to put it on at all.

553
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Okay, don't worry.

554
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
People are here.

555
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Who?

556
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
The police.

557
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
A contract?

558
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Yes.

559
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
To the police station.

560
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Do you know?

561
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I don't think I know because there's a lot of blood.

562
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
You can sleep no matter what.

563
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Okay?

564
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Yes.

565
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I'll ask you to put in a call.

566
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Hello.

567
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Hello.

568
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
You're here.

569
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
This is my cousin.

570
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
My name is Min Kang-ryong.

571
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
You have a nice voice.

572
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
My name is Kim Myung-gil.

573
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I went home and my brother said he was drinking.

574
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
I was shamelessly caught.

575
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
I heard you're a big man.

576
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
It's an honor to meet you.

577
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
I'm honored.

578
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
This is Lee Jin-soo, who works with me.

579
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
We met somewhere, right?

580
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I look a little common.

581
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I'm sorry.

582
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Have a seat.

583
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Yes.

584
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
I brought mine because I can't drink.

585
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I was going to buy it today.

586
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Please.

587
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
This friend can't drink.

588
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I'm sorry.

589
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
I'm sorry.

590
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
It's hard to be sober alone.

591
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
But I have to get drunk together to not say anything else.

592
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Then our CEO will buy us a drink.

593
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
I think he'll drink well.

594
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
It's good to be loyal.

595
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Okay, give it to me.

596
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
You're drinking well.

597
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
It's soft, right?

598
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Yes.

599
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
I'll give you a drink.

600
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Do you want a glass?

601
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
I think you're thinking about a cup.

602
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Give me a cup.

603
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
The civil servant who only drinks soba drinks in a cup.

604
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
I'm lucky today.

605
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Let's have a drink.

606
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
You're drinking well.

607
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
It's my drink. Give me a drink, too.

608
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Then I'll do it with one hand.

609
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Go ahead.

610
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Wait.

611
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Drink it.

612
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
You two are good at drinking.

613
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,000
If I get drunk and make a mistake today, please forgive me.

614
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Okay. If you're too suspicious, where are you?

615
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I'll arrest you.

616
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Let's drink.

617
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Let's drink.

618
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
We've had a drink together.

619
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Shall we be honest?

620
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Let's do that.

621
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Do you have a lot of money?

622
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I'm making a lot of money because I'm a blacksmith.

623
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Do you have a billion won?

624
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
I don't lie with money.

625
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Really?

626
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
It's weird.

627
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Even if someone I know takes out a smile cap, I don't think I'll get 500.

628
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
I know.

629
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
I guess the National Tax Administration doesn't work properly these days.

630
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Shall we call him?

631
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
My brother, Choi Hae-nae.

632
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
The president got a good job. Apologize to him.

633
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
I'm sorry.

634
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
I drank in vain.

635
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I'm angry.

636
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
You don't have to worry about money.

637
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Really?

638
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
I see.

639
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
I should never worry about money.

640
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000
But my mother asked the president not to see it.

641
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
I was really grateful then.

642
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
But the person who took the money that day...

643
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
He said he was in his mid-40s.

644
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,000
What happened to the president's mid-40s for 20 years?

645
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Did he do a lifting?

646
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Do it a lot these days.

647
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
I thought I wouldn't ask my mother.

648
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
What is it?

649
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
You're quiet.

650
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Do you keep your mouth shut when you're in trouble?

651
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Did you teach like that in prison?

652
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
He's laughing.

653
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
He's laughing.

654
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,000
I'm out of alcohol, so let's end it.

655
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Let's end it.

656
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
President, I made 1,000.

657
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
So we'll never see each other again.

658
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Come here.

659
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Come on.

660
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Hurry up.

661
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,000
If you play with my family's name one more time,

662
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
you'll die.

663
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Okay?

664
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Huh?

665
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
You worked hard.

666
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
You have a knife.

667
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
I'm right.

668
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Let's go.

669
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
I don't know.

670
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
I wanted to see you well.

671
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I think I worked hard.

672
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Chang-do.

673
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Yes.

674
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Go out with the culprit and make me a 약.

675
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
A strong one.

676
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Okay.

677
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Thank you for coming with me.

678
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
No, it's okay.

679
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Why?

680
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Why?

681
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Are you going in, too?

682
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Yeah, I'm going to appeal to the boss.

683
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
I was wondering if I should get a job.

684
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
It's nice to have me.

685
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Yeah, I love it.

686
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Yeah, so I'll hit you with a baton next to it.

687
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
MSG.

688
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Okay, let's go.

689
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Hello.

690
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Hello.

691
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
You found it well.

692
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Yes.

693
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,000
I paid the loan with the money the boss gave me in the morning.

694
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Thank you so much.

695
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Thank you so much.

696
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
I believe you'll do well.

697
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
I'll do my best.

698
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Hello, boss.

699
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
I'm Hong Woo-jin.

700
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
I'm a high school student.

701
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
I'm a high school student.

702
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
I'm a high school student.

703
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Hello, boss.

704
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
I'm Hong Woo-jin.

705
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
I used to help you with your work.

706
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,000
I'm a very special person who served as a brother when I was a Marine.

707
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
I wanted to help you by watching you.

708
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Actually, I couldn't help you with my ability, so I was very painful as an older brother.

709
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
But I'm so glad that a really good person like you helped me.

710
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
And I'm so grateful as a brother who cares about you.

711
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,000
And now I've decided that Hong Woo-jin can help me.

712
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:22,000
I'm afraid I'm too much of a burden to tell you my experience in front of the legendary boss of Myeong-dong.

713
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
But I know better than you.

714
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
I'm going to help you get used to your job.

715
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
What if I help you in the beginning?

716
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Wouldn't this be a little help?

717
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
No, maybe it'll be a big help.

718
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
I came here with a lot of trust.

719
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
If you allow me, I'd like to work with you and help you.

720
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
I'm sorry.

721
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Well, that's right.

722
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Thank you.

723
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Sit down.

724
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Yes.

725
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Thank you.

726
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Thank you.

727
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
I'm not saying anything.

728
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
I'll pay you the salary, but I'm not the one who hired you.

729
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Pardon?

730
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
I still have an interview with Hyun-joo.

731
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
What if I fail the interview?

732
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
You have to get your salary back.

733
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
I used up all the money to pay the loan.

734
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
I believe you'll do well.

735
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Pardon?

736
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Hyun-joo is against people being attached.

737
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
I really don't have a reason to say anything.

738
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Good luck.

739
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Sir, if I can persuade Hyun-joo to hire Gun-woo and me,

740
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
can I get my salary?

741
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Let's do that.

742
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
I have a scalp massage appointment.

743
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Oh, okay.

744
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Yes, you can go.

745
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
And...

746
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
And...

747
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Buy something delicious for lunch with this.

748
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Thank you.

749
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
I want to work for this company that is perfect.

750
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
You two...

751
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Be sure to stick together.

752
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Yes, sir.

753
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Good luck.

754
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Good luck.

755
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Good luck.

756
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
What?

757
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
You...

758
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
What?

759
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
What is this?

760
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
It was in here.

761
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
I think this will cost over 100 million won.

762
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
100 million won?

763
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Hey.

764
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Hey.

765
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
It's here too.

766
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Wait.

767
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
1,750 million won.

768
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
1,850 million won.

769
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
1,920 million won?

770
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
2,000 million won.

771
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Hey.

772
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
I...

773
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
I actually met Hyun-joo once.

774
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
What?

775
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
What do you mean?

776
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
I met her once.

777
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
What?

778
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
I met her once.

779
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
What?

780
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
You met her once?

781
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
I met her once.

782
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
What?

783
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
I met her once.

784
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
What?

785
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
What do you mean?

786
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
A few days ago, when I went to see you,

787
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
a homeless person was chasing me.

788
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
I got hit by a shocker by Hyun-joo.

789
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
A shocker?

790
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Yes.

791
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Did you two fight?

792
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Yes.

793
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
I just got cursed and that's it.

794
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Oh.

795
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Don't worry.

796
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
I'll take care of everything.

797
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
You just stay still.

798
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
I forgot how many times I said that.

799
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Sorry.

800
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Oh.

801
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Oh.

802
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Hello, Hyun-joo.

803
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,000
We're here to help you do your job more safely.

804
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
The CEO hired us.

805
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Hashtag, guard.

806
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Hashtag, volunteer.

807
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Hashtag, manager.

808
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Hashtag, oppa.

809
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Oppa.

810
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
What?

811
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
You can think of me as oppa.

812
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Nice to meet you.

813
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,000
If you need anything, we'll help you.

814
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
I don't need anything.

815
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:22,000
You can take your time and tell us what you need.

816
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,000
I won't need anything from now on, so leave.

817
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Okay.

818
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
You don't like us?

819
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
How can I not like you?

820
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
I don't need you.

821
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,000
I've never hired you, so how can you say that?

822
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:46,000
I've never had any problems so far, so I don't need you.

823
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,000
And I hate people who argue.

824
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
I'm not trying to argue.

825
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
That's what you argue about.

826
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Leave.

827
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
You can leave.

828
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,000
The CEO said we can stay.

829
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,000
You didn't try to persuade me?

830
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,000
You're lying now.

831
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,000
I thought you were just pretending.

832
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Leave.

833
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Get out of here.

834
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Excuse me.

835
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Can't you hear me?

836
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Get out.

837
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Get out.

838
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
I really need this.

839
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Please give me a month.

840
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
I'll leave if it's really not helpful.

841
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Please give me a month.

842
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Excuse me.

843
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
I'll lend you the money if you need it.

844
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
I'll talk to you, so please leave.

845
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
It's really uncomfortable.

846
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
The money...

847
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:09,000
The CEO gave me a two-year salary in advance.

848
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:13,000
My mother was loaned out of the Smile Capital.

849
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
The debt increased rapidly,

850
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,000
so I paid back with the money the CEO gave me this morning.

851
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
I...

852
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,000
I'm in big trouble if I have to return the money.

853
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Please.

854
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Please, just once.

855
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Get up.

856
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Let's eat.

857
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Why did you borrow the money from the Smile Capital?

858
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
My mother was fooled.

859
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,000
How much did you lend?

860
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
100 million won.

861
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
You paid off the loan and that's it?

862
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Did you have any other damage?

863
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
My mother ran a cafe,

864
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,000
but it all broke down.

865
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Did you get hurt on your face?

866
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Yes.

867
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
That must be so unfair.

868
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Did you call the police?

869
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
No.

870
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,000
I threatened to kill my mother.

871
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Who?

872
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
The CEO.

873
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Here's your delicious hamburger.

874
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Here.

875
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Let's hear it out.

876
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
I'm sure you heard,

877
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
but my grandfather is a loan shark.

878
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,000
He lends money to people in need.

879
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
But sometimes,

880
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,000
there are people who use his good heart.

881
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
That's what Yang Jaemyeong did.

882
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
He lied that his mother needed surgery,

883
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,000
and he borrowed 10 million won to dive.

884
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
I found him after half a year,

885
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,000
and he was doing that in front of Nammun Station.

886
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:13,000
At first, I thought Yang Jaemyeong was a real thief,

887
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
but when I looked closer,

888
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
his teeth were so clean.

889
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
So I looked back,

890
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
and I saw him cosplaying as a homeless man

891
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
and walking around at night,

892
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,000
stealing real homeless people's ID cards.

893
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:31,000
He made a bank account with his ID card

894
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:36,000
and used it to bribe people in the private property.

895
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
He was so professional,

896
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,000
so I thought there would be someone behind him.

897
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,000
I found out that he was connected to Yang Jaemyeong.

898
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Do you know?

899
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
I do.

900
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
What we're going to do today is to find out

901
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:07,000
how many ID cards Yang Jaemyeong steals a day.

902
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Don't get involved in anything.

903
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
If we get caught,

904
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
the plan I made will be ruined.

905
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
The number of people who stole the ID card

906
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,000
is not the same as the number of people who stole the ID card.

907
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,000
The number of people who stole the ID card is not the same as the number of people who stole the ID card.

908
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,000
The number of people who stole the ID card is not the same as the number of people who stole the ID card.

909
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,000
The number of people who stole the ID card is not the same as the number of people who stole the ID card.

910
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,000
The number of people who stole the ID card is not the same as the number of people who stole the ID card.

911
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,000
The number of people who stole the ID card is not the same as the number of people who stole the ID card.

912
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,000
The number of people who stole the ID card is not the same as the number of people who stole the ID card.

913
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,000
The number of people who stole the ID card is not the same as the number of people who stole the ID card.

914
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:21,000
My byte infrared is mr.

915
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
There is a hat behind. Cover your face.

916
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
I'm sorry.

917
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
How's he?

918
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
He's too fast.

919
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
I think he's going to die.

920

We're from the North Korea Association of Seoul City.

938
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Sir, if you have ID, we'll register you as an association's boss.

Then I can help you until next week.
