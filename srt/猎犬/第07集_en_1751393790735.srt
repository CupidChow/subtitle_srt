1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
The

2
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,800
patient's condition is okay now?

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,300
BP is dropping again.

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,100
Let me check for a moment.

5
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,200
Please eat this.

6
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,900
You have to eat well today.

7
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,300
Thank you.

8
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,300
Okay.

9
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm sorry, but did you see where the person who was here went?

10
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,800
He left earlier.

11
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,300
When?

12
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,000
About 10 minutes ago?

13
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,800
Thank you.

14
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,940
Massage

15
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,200
Uh..

16
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,280
Are you dragged by Ho Mu There?

17
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,200
Yes.

18
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,660
I finished the surgery.

19
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,660
The surgery went well.

20
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:01,660
We'll have to wait and see how it goes, but the surgery was successful.

21
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,660
Thank you.

22
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,660
Thank you so much.

23
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,660
Cheer up.

24
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,660
Yes, yes.

25
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,660
Cheer up.

26
00:04:55,660 --> 00:05:05,660
Hey, you're always surprised.

27
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,660
Let's go.

28
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,660
Let's go.

29
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:28,660
Oh, my God.

30
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:58,660
Oh, my God.

31
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:34,660
86, 88, 89, 10.

32
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:40,660
One, two, three.

33
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:46,660
12, 13, 14.

34
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,660
Good night.

35
00:06:49,660 --> 00:07:04,660
Good night.

36
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:10,660
Let's keep going.

37
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:20,660
15, 16.

38
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,660
Hey!

39
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,660
Hey!

40
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,660
Hey!

41
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,660
Hey!

42
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,660
You bastard!

43
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,660
You bastard!

44
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,660
Hey!

45
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,660
Hey!

46
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,660
Hey!

47
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,660
You bastard!

48
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,660
You broke the balance by changing the center.

49
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,660
That's how you broke the balance.

50
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,660
Guys.

51
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,660
Let's talk for a second.

52
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,660
I told you no.

53
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,660
If you go up there, you'll die.

54
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,660
I know why you're worried about us.

55
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,660
Why don't you listen to me?

56
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,660
Are you rebelling?

57
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:28,660
I'll tell you today.

58
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:34,660
I believe I can win by fighting with Kim Myung-gil.

59
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:38,660
Yang Joong and Du-young are dead.

60
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,660
How do you guys win?

61
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:44,660
We just have to do what the boss told us to do.

62
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:49,660
There are a lot of people who lost their family and lost their precious things to Kim Myung-gil.

63
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:55,660
The boss said that if we gather all the people and work together, we can win.

64
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,660
We're hiding because we know we can't win by fighting alone.

65
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:01,660
But if people like you and I show up,

66
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,660
I'll support you.

67
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:07,660
What if Kim Myung-gil catches us?

68
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,660
You don't have to worry about fighting.

69
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:13,660
My brother's wounds have healed, and I've gained two more weight.

70
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:16,660
I've prepared enough to catch Kim Myung-gil.

71
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:22,660
I believe that if you use what the boss and the guys taught you, you can beat Kim Myung-gil.

72
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:26,660
I can't allow it.

73
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:31,660
I can't allow it, so I know.

74
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:01,660
I'll be in Rome when the boss opens this letter.

75
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:06,660
I got a small house with the money my grandfather gave me.

76
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:13,660
I promised my grandfather that we would go to Rome together with Kim Myung-gil.

77
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,660
I'm sorry.

78
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,660
I'm sorry.

79
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,660
I'm sorry.

80
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,660
I'm sorry.

81
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,660
I'm sorry.

82
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:30,660
I promised my grandfather that we would go to Rome together with Kim Myung-gil, but I ruined it all.

83
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,660
I won't ask you to understand me.

84
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:39,660
But I can't stand it because I think of my grandfather when I'm here.

85
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:45,660
I can't stop crying wherever I go.

86
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,660
I think I'm going crazy.

87
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,660
I'll get better if I go to a faraway country.

88
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,660
I love you.

89
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,660
I'm sorry.

90
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,660
It hurts so much.

91
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,660
This isn't a pain.

92
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:14,660
Your weakness is leaving your body.

93
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,660
What are you talking about?

94
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:19,660
I'm getting stronger than yesterday.

95
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:26,660
Guys, follow me.

96
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:52,660
This is the last emergency fund that the boss left.

97
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,660
Take it and go up.

98
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:58,660
I'm sorry I tried to lock you up with my thoughts.

99
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:01,660
I'll prepare a house and a car in Seoul.

100
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:04,660
Don't get hurt.

101
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:08,660
Thank you, driver.

102
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:13,660
I will win.

103
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,660
I'm sorry.

104
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:49,660
I'm sorry.

105
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,660
809.

106
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,660
Oh, brother.

107
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,660
Yes.

108
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,660
Hello.

109
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:19,660
We're here because Mr. Oh In-mook sent us.

110
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,660
Hello.

111
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,660
Go in.

112
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,660
Jung.

113
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:37,660
When I come back, if the tape is torn or if it shows that it's back, I'll call the police.

114
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,660
Why?

115
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,660
Because I have underwear.

116
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:45,660
Oh, never.

117
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:48,660
There's a bed up there.

118
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,660
Who's going to sleep on top?

119
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,660
It doesn't matter.

120
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,660
Yes.

121
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,660
I'm going to sleep on the floor.

122
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,660
I'm going to sleep on the floor.

123
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,660
Why would you sleep on the floor?

124
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,660
It doesn't matter.

125
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,660
Then you sleep on top.

126
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,660
Yes.

127
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:07,660
I'm sorry, but can I ask why you made that choice?

128
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:15,660
It's up to me.

129
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:20,660
It's a good thing that the card that opens the front door and my grandfather said he was renting it.

130
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,660
And it's my number, so don't call me if you can.

131
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,660
I'm busy.

132
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,660
All right?

133
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,660
Yes.

134
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:36,660
Then.

135
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:43,660
Thank you.

136
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,660
Hey, wait a minute.

137
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:48,660
Didn't you just tell Mr. Oh that you're his grandfather?

138
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:52,660
Yeah, I guess he's a granddaughter.

139
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,660
Oh, you look like him.

140
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:59,660
And then I saw you wearing glasses with Adam.

141
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,660
But don't you think you're forcing him to rent the room?

142
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,660
Right?

143
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,660
I'm sorry.

144
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,660
Hey, forget it.

145
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:12,660
Let's find a strategy.

146
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:18,660
Oh, my.

147
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:26,660
What's the reason?

148
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:41,660
I think it's important to get the information first by getting the name of the victim.

149
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:46,660
What about you?

150
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,660
I think it's important to collect the items first.

151
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,660
We need to move together to create synergy.

152
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,660
That's good, too.

153
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,660
But how do you find this person?

154
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,660
You said you'd be of great help.

155
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:03,660
I've been thinking about it while I was coming up, but I don't think it's going to be easy to meet.

156
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:12,660
I'll try to get it in my head.

157
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:19,660
Oh, brother.

158
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,660
Hey, this is a model that opens the lid.

159
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,660
Does this lid open?

160
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:24,660
Yeah.

161
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:35,660
It's a cloth.

162
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:39,660
Brother.

163
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:43,660
There are a lot of people in Myeong-dong who have a smile capital like you.

164
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,660
We're going to gather them and put them together.

165
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:48,660
Honestly, the people in this neighborhood.

166
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,660
You know, they're all people you know.

167
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:56,660
When you stand in front of them, they're all going to move.

168
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,660
Next time, we'll get the money back.

169
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:04,660
Smile Capital should never be able to do this again against the private investors.

170
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,660
You have to get rid of it.

171
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,660
What?

172
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:15,660
You lost a few hundred million, too.

173
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,660
I can't.

174
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,660
If this goes wrong, I might really die.

175
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,660
Then what about the money you lost?

176
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,660
That's the money.

177
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,660
I can make money.

178
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,660
Anyway, I never get involved.

179
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:31,660
My life is more important than money.

180
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:41,660
Please.

181
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:52,660
What the hell is this?

182
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:56,660
What's wrong with this?

183
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:57,660
Senior.

184
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,660
Senior.

185
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,660
Can you come in?

186
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:06,660
What's going on with our junior soldiers?

187
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,660
What happened to this?

188
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,660
Huh?

189
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:18,660
A few days ago, these guys came in and went in.

190
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:28,660
Why?

191
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:32,660
I have a month's worth of debt left to pay off.

192
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:38,660
If you take this money, I'll give you five parts of the surgery.

193
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:42,660
This is a business that I have nothing to lose.

194
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:46,660
Then let's sign the contract right away.

195
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:51,660
I guess our elegant madam is not used to this.

196
00:18:51,660 --> 00:19:05,660
These things generally trade for trust in each other.

197
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:09,660
I'll find someone else.

198
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,660
No, no, no.

199
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:21,660
Overall, there are exceptions.

200
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:32,660
I found out later, but if I don't get my book back in a month, I'll give half of the money to the gun.

201
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:37,660
It was written like that.

202
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:40,660
It's similar to the smile capital of the contract.

203
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,660
What is that?

204
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:45,660
The CEO is Kim Myeong-gil.

205
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,660
Kim Myeong-gil who was under the boss?

206
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,660
Yes.

207
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:52,660
Where's that bastard?

208
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:56,660
Senior, did you hear about the boss?

209
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,660
What?

210
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:08,660
The boss was attacked by Kim Myeong-gil.

211
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,660
What are you talking about?

212
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:17,660
Kim Myeong-gil killed both the boss and the boss.

213
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:20,660
We're hiding in the basement with Mr. Oh.

214
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:28,660
Oh, my God, it's so boring.

215
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,660
Oh, my God.

216
00:20:50,660 --> 00:21:00,660
Why is the boss dead?

217
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:06,660
Why is our boss dead?

218
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:10,660
Answer me, you bastards.

219
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:20,660
Why is our boss dead?

220
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,660
I'm tired.

221
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:38,660
I'm so tired.

222
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,660
Let's go in and rest.

223
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:46,660
Yes.

224
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:50,660
What?

225
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:54,660
Long time no see.

226
00:21:54,660 --> 00:22:04,660
What's wrong with you guys?

227
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:12,660
Hey, I'll tell you everything, so don't hit me.

228
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,660
Huh?

229
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,660
There's a rumor among the homeless.

230
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:18,660
These days, people are dying in the disabled facilities.

231
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,660
Did someone ask you?

232
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,660
How's the smile capital?

233
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:25,660
You asked me in detail.

234
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:28,660
Did you open the casino?

235
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,660
Wait a minute.

236
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:34,660
Hey, close your eyes.

237
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:37,660
What?

238
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:40,660
Gunwoo, be tough.

239
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,660
What should I do?

240
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:45,660
First of all, out of honorifics.

241
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:48,660
But, bro, he looks like he's over 40.

242
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:51,660
I'm a little shy to talk informally.

243
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:52,660
Okay, then.

244
00:22:52,660 --> 00:23:01,660
If you think you're sick, punch me.

245
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:04,660
It's hard to believe, but I'm 31.

246
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:07,660
I don't know you two, so you don't have to hit me.

247
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,660
I'm not in any place where I'm sick.

248
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:12,660
A while ago, a teenager broke both Achilles' heel with his 40th.

249
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:15,660
It took me four months to recover.

250
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,660
That teenager is our brother.

251
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,660
Watch your mouth.

252
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,660
I was wrong then.

253
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:23,660
It was worth it.

254
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,660
You asked for the price, right?

255
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,660
Yes.

256
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:29,660
I heard the director talking on the phone a while ago.

257
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,660
Director?

258
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,660
What's your name?

259
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,660
Kim Jun-min.

260
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,660
Is he alive?

261
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:40,660
I almost died because a teenager cut his neck.

262
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:44,660
Oh, you're all one.

263
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:47,660
Okay, I understand 100%.

264
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:50,660
I'm going to be careful from now on, so you don't have to hit me.

265
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,660
I hate Kim Jun-min.

266
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,660
He's a son of a bitch.

267
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,660
Smy Capital is a son of a bitch, too.

268
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,660
I'm stuck because of money.

269
00:23:58,660 --> 00:23:59,660
You're here today.

270
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,660
I have a lot of things piled up.

271
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,660
I'll tell you everything.

272
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,660
Okay, so please tell me the conclusion.

273
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:07,660
I heard that you're still fighting with the I-group.

274
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:10,660
That's why Kim Myung-gil is so sensitive.

275
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:11,660
Again?

276
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,660
There's a man called Lim Jang-do.

277
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,660
Kim Jun-min and a tough guy.

278
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:40,140
He was in charge of the

279
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,140
Why?

280
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:45,140
You can't trust the people in Daegu, can you?

281
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:49,140
And I'm going to rent a golf course in Gyeonggi-do.

282
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:52,140
That's why we're playing like this.

283
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:56,140
You don't even give me a lot of money, but you make me work a lot.

284
00:24:56,140 --> 00:25:03,140
That's all I've been asking for these days.

285
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:13,140
Wait a minute.

286
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,140
You know you're screwed if you send this to Kim Jun-min, right?

287
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,140
Keep your mouth shut.

288
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,140
Don't worry.

289
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:21,140
If you need anything, call me anytime.

290
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:24,140
I'm also one of those who want to ruin Smy Capital.

291
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:28,140
Then can you find the I-group's number?

292
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,140
I don't think that's going to be easy.

293
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:40,140
I'm worried about the people in the group.

294
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:43,140
Oh, your name is Hong Min-beom.

295
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,140
Hey, we're the same age.

296
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:49,140
I think Seoul is the best for noodles.

297
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:55,140
Yeah.

298
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:58,140
Why are you using someone else's computer?

299
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:01,140
I'm sorry.

300
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,140
I'm really sorry.

301
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,140
I've never opened a messenger.

302
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,140
If you have money, go to my PC room.

303
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:08,140
Okay, I'm sorry.

304
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,140
Turn it off quickly.

305
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:13,140
Okay, I'll use number two just once.

306
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,140
Turn it off quickly.

307
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:20,140
Yes, I'm sorry.

308
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,140
What do I do?

309
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:33,140
I think I got an alarm because I logged in to the messenger when I turned on the computer.

310
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:35,140
Wow, awesome.

311
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,140
Why?

312
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:40,140
Hong Min-beom's followers are 500,000.

313
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:50,140
Wait a minute.

314
00:26:51,140 --> 00:27:01,140
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

315
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:35,140
Did I tell you to sign a contract so you could make money today or not?

316
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:49,140
I was going to, but my father...

317
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:59,140
Min-beom.

318
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:02,140
Help me, please.

319
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:04,140
Help me.

320
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,140
Help me.

321
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:14,140
Fix the contract I told you to by Friday.

322
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:19,140
I'll fix the contract by Friday.

323
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,140
I'll release a video when I get it.

324
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:24,140
I'm going to make you a second-hand asset because of that video.

325
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:34,140
Okay?

326
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:54,140
I'm sorry.

327
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:24,140
I'm sorry.

328
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:34,140
What the hell are you guys doing?

329
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,140
Let's meet.

330
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,140
Let's meet quickly.

331
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:39,140
I have to sign a contract by Friday.

332
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:41,140
Then ask them if they can do it now.

333
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:43,140
Let's go to the bar you go to.

334
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:49,140
If you give me some alcohol, I'll be honest.

335
00:29:49,140 --> 00:30:06,140
Don't worry. I'll put it on our team.

336
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,140
In-seong.

337
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,140
Yes.

338
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,140
It's good, right?

339
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,140
Yes.

340
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:12,140
Don't drink it.

341
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:20,140
Yes.

342
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:22,140
Hello.

343
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:27,140
Hello.

344
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:30,140
I'm Min-beom's real brother.

345
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:32,140
I'm Kim Geon-woo.

346
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,140
I'm Hong Woo-jin.

347
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:36,140
I'm the one who sent you a DM.

348
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:44,140
Let's sit down.

349
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:53,140
Let's talk while we're drinking.

350
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:55,140
I'm really sorry.

351
00:30:55,140 --> 00:31:03,140
I got stabbed by Kim Young-gil's assholes and my liver broke, so I can't drink.

352
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:07,140
If you don't want to drink, just say you don't want to drink.

353
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:14,140
It's okay.

354
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,140
It's real.

355
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:20,140
Here, here, here.

356
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,140
Okay.

357
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,140
Yes, okay.

358
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:24,140
Get off. It's too much to see, so get off.

359
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:27,140
Yeah, take a break.

360
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,140
Did you get stabbed that much?

361
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:32,140
No, I don't drink.

362
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:40,140
Let's have a drink while we're talking about something deep.

363
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:44,140
Didn't we all tell you to be honest and meet?

364
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:49,140
How can we trust you if you take your feet off from the smallest things?

365
00:31:49,140 --> 00:32:03,140
And you said we needed you, so we asked you to meet.

366
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:05,140
I'll just have a drink.

367
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:12,140
No, I'll drink it.

368
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:22,140
Here, Mr. Hwang.

369
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:27,140
Let's have a drink.

370
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:29,140
One shot.

371
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:39,140
Yes.

372
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,140
You're eating well.

373
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:45,140
Let's go to this glass with the busy people.

374
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:47,140
Whiskey is a glass.

375
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,140
Yes.

376
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,140
Here we go.

377
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:59,140
Here we go.

378
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:19,140
Oh, my God.

379
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:29,140
Oh, my God.

380
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:39,140
Oh, my God.

381
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:41,140
Oh, my God.

382
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:43,140
Oh, my God.

383
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:53,140
Hey, slow down.

384
00:33:53,140 --> 00:34:03,140
Oh, this is good.

385
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:33,140
Oh, my God.

386
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:38,140
What's this?

387
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:41,140
Kang Yong-hee.

388
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:42,140
Kang Yong-hee.

389
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:43,140
Kang Yong-hee.

390
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:45,140
Kang Yong-hee, follow me.

391
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:50,140
Because of that bastard.

392
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:55,140
I got a doll hair loss and I'm going to go to the police station.

393
00:34:55,140 --> 00:35:00,140
I hit you as soon as I saw you.

394
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:04,140
Our chief loves me a lot.

395
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,140
Hey, you two, to me.

396
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,140
Hey, Min Cheong-jang.

397
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:07,140
Hey, Cheong.

398
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,140
Don't do that.

399
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:13,140
Min Cheong-jang, I'm not like you.

400
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,140
Take good care of him.

401
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,140
He's our family.

402
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,140
Take good care of him.

403
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,140
I think he's nice.

404
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:19,140
Woo-jin and you.

405
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:21,140
You two do whatever you want.

406
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:23,140
I'll push you all the way.

407
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:25,140
Do you want me to pour you a drink?

408
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,140
Drink it.

409
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,140
Yes.

410
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:29,140
I can't drink it all the way.

411
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:31,140
I'm so drunk.

412
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:41,140
I need to take another two hours.

413
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:53,140
Oh, my God.

414
00:35:53,140 --> 00:36:05,140
Oh, my God.

415
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:15,140
Hey.

416
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:17,140
Oh, my God.

417
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:20,140
Oh, hi, bro.

418
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:23,140
Hi.

419
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:27,140
What happened to this?

420
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:32,140
Oh, my brother brought us over to your house yesterday.

421
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:35,140
I was going to wake you up because the ramen was ready.

422
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,140
You have to do the hangover.

423
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:38,140
Sit down.

424
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,140
Hey, Geon-woo.

425
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:40,140
Give me this.

426
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:42,140
I'll wake up Kang Kyung-hee.

427
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:48,140
How much did you drink?

428
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,140
Geon-woo?

429
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,140
Geon-woo?

430
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:55,140
Geon-woo.

431
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:57,140
What did we do?

432
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:00,140
Kang Kyung-hee brought a computer expert from the police station.

433
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:02,140
After hacking Kim Myeong-gil's phone,

434
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:05,140
I'm going to burn all the hard drives in the safe.

435
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,140
You have to get rid of the ramen.

436
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,140
Hey, wake up.

437
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:13,140
This Friday, Kim Myeong-gil is coming to sign the contract for the I-L Group.

438
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,140
I decided to go then.

439
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:17,140
Who?

440
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:19,140
Jang.

441
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,140
Of course it's me.

442
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,140
Let's eat.

443
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:32,140
How much did you drink?

444
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:40,140
Enjoy your meal.

445
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,140
Thank you for the meal.

446
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:49,140
Thank you for the meal.

447
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,140
It's been a long time.

448
00:37:51,140 --> 00:38:02,140
It's hot.

449
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:04,140
It's really big.

450
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:06,140
It's so hot.

451
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:09,140
What floor is this?

452
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:11,140
Thank you.

453
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,140
Hello.

454
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:13,140
Hello.

455
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:18,140
Hello.

456
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:22,140
I'll introduce our employees.

457
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:25,140
You do it.

458
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,140
I'm a detective from Yunwang-gu.

459
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:29,140
Nice to meet you.

460
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,140
Hello.

461
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:33,140
Hello, I'm Kang Tae-young, a cyber crime investigator.

462
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:35,140
What I have here is a secret.

463
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:38,140
Nice to meet you.

464
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:42,140
What I have here is a secret, and we're all secrets.

465
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:46,140
Anyway, Tae-young is the best in Korea in terms of cyber security.

466
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:51,140
I'm going to give you a briefing on how to hack Kim Myung-gil's cell phone and activate the safe.

467
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:53,140
Yes, there are two ways.

468
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,140
The first way is Wi-Fi.

469
00:38:54,140 --> 00:39:00,140
First, if I install a small signal in the meeting room and block the signal, it becomes temporarily impossible to use the Internet.

470
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:03,140
Then, Yong Hee-ja naturally induces Wi-Fi to catch it.

471
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:07,140
The moment Yong Hee-ja connects to the transmitter I made, I can infiltrate the cell phone.

472
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:09,140
If I infiltrate the cell phone, the game is over.

473
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:13,140
I've also done a preliminary investigation into the safe app that Yong Hee-ja can use.

474
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:17,140
The second way is to open a more direct gate.

475
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:20,140
We're going to take a personal QR code when we enter the building because of Corona.

476
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:24,140
I'm going to put the QR code I made at the entrance and make it take a picture with my cell phone.

477
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:28,140
The moment the QR code goes into the cell phone, the door I can hack opens.

478
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:31,140
We'll use two methods at the same time.

479
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:37,140
No, what should I do?

480
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:42,140
It's best for Yong Hee-ja to use our Wi-Fi as long as possible.

481
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:48,140
I'm going to infiltrate the cloud and scratch the data, but it takes some time depending on the capacity.

482
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:56,140
If you're lucky, you can use all the evidence that he's been using so far.

483
00:39:56,140 --> 00:40:00,140
But what if he's conscious?

484
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:05,140
There's another way.

485
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:09,140
To prevent that, we'll use two methods at the same time.

486
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:11,140
No, no, no, no.

487
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:15,140
No, that's not it.

488
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:21,140
Whatever you do, you have to get rid of Hada tomorrow.

489
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:23,140
I think I'd do that if I took my cell phone.

490
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:24,140
It's simple.

491
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,140
It's not hard.

492
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:28,140
Why are you talking so hard?

493
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:30,140
I'll take the cell phone.

494
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:36,140
I'm not going to.

495
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:38,140
Can I ask what's going on in the room?

496
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:40,140
Oh, my God.

497
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:44,140
You guys stay still.

498
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:50,140
Yes.

499
00:40:50,140 --> 00:41:00,140
Lim Bum, let's take a look.

500
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:16,140
Lim Bum.

501
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:19,140
You're very nervous, aren't you?

502
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:22,140
This is a pretty difficult operation.

503
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:24,140
It's a big limit because it's moving unofficially.

504
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:30,140
If I can't erase this hard, I'll have to get rid of Kim Myung-gil for the rest of my life.

505
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:32,140
I'm in trouble.

506
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:34,140
So I'm really going to do my best.

507
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:42,140
Just trust me a little more.

508
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:52,140
Okay.

509
00:41:52,140 --> 00:42:02,140
No.

510
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:04,140
Are you sure?

511
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:14,140
Of course.

512
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:16,140
Are you sure?

513
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:48,140
You can measure the temperature.

514
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:50,140
Take a QR code with the camera.

515
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:53,140
Isn't it usually the other way around?

516
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:56,140
It's our building system.

517
00:42:56,140 --> 00:43:04,140
Yes, it's unique.

518
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:14,140
It's working.

519
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:16,140
Okay.

520
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:18,140
Yes.

521
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:28,140
It's working.

522
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:30,140
Okay.

523
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:38,140
Yes.

524
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:39,140
Oh?

525
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:41,140
What's wrong?

526
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:43,140
There's nothing in the album.

527
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:53,140
Wait a minute.

528
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:59,140
There's no emergency app here.

529
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:01,140
You heard it right, right?

530
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:02,140
Yes.

531
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:07,140
It wasn't a situation where the head of the department could lie.

532
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:20,140
Did he notice?

533
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:22,140
Oh, my.

534
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:25,140
Director Hong.

535
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:35,140
Hello.

536
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:45,140
Oh, my.

537
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:47,140
Why?

538
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:57,140
There's no emergency app on my phone.

539
00:44:57,140 --> 00:45:07,140
I'm sorry.

540
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:19,140
You have two phones.

541
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:21,140
What are you talking about?

542
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:23,140
The phone I took the QR code on is black.

543
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:27,140
This is silver.

544
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:29,140
What do we do now?

545
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:41,140
We just have to get him to connect to Wi-Fi.

546
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:47,140
The team leader is coming back.

547
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:57,140
No, it's okay.

548
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:59,140
What happened?

549
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:01,140
Kim Byung-gil has two phones.

550
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:04,140
We hacked one, but there's no emergency app.

551
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:07,140
The app is in that pouch.

552
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:09,140
So?

553
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:11,140
We're still thinking about it.

554
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:13,140
I'm thinking about it.

555
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:15,140
I really don't have time.

556
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:23,140
It's over soon.

557
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:35,140
Tae-young, Hangu, let's get ready for a moment.

558
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:37,140
What did the head of the department take the video with?

559
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:38,140
Phone.

560
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:41,140
Then wouldn't the head of the department have sent a video to Kim Byung-gil's phone?

561
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:43,140
I need to get a confirmation.

562
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:44,140
Yes.

563
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:48,140
Before you sign the contract, just ask him to make the video first.

564
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:51,140
Then Kim Byung-gil has no choice but to take out his phone.

565
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:53,140
What if I didn't send it?

566
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:55,140
What am I going to say because of the fraud?

567
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:58,140
If you're proud, show me the conversation with the head of the department.

568
00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:02,140
And tell him that the head of the department told the CEO that he would send it.

569
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:03,140
Seriously.

570
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:06,140
No one believes criminals like Kim Byung-gil.

571
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:20,140
I'm sure he told you to send a video after the work is done to make sure the head of the department is done.

572
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:24,140
I'm not confident.

573
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:25,140
Trust me.

574
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:27,140
No, it's not that.

575
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:34,140
I'm not confident I saw Kim Byung-gil.

576
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:37,140
I'm scared.

577
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:39,140
I'm shaking my hands just by looking at it.

578
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:47,140
Fuck, bro.

579
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:52,140
Minbeom.

580
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:57,140
I believe you can do it.

581
00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:00,140
If you're a little weird, I'll hit you right away.

582
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:09,140
And if one thing gets bigger, I'll mobilize the power of my family to protect you.

583
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:17,140
So let's be brave once.

584
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:20,140
Brother, we'll follow you.

585
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:30,140
I can do it.

586
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:45,140
Everyone was waiting.

587
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:48,140
Where did you go?

588
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:51,140
The company's employees should leave for a while.

589
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:53,140
I have something to talk to CEO Kim.

590
00:48:53,140 --> 00:49:08,140
Yes.

591
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:17,140
Do you want to be arrested for current crimes?

592
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:19,140
What is it?

593
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:21,140
Catch the bastard?

594
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:27,140
Before you stamp it, delete the video first.

595
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:29,140
Stay home.

596
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:32,140
I'll go home and delete it right away if I make a contract.

597
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:35,140
I promise.

598
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:37,140
Are you kidding me right now?

599
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:43,140
I know your subordinate sent it on his cell phone.

600
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:53,140
Delete it in front of me.

601
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:15,140
I'll erase it.

602
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:18,140
No, please let me erase it myself.

603
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:21,140
I can't believe it.

604
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:23,140
If you don't want to.

605
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:27,140
Then I don't contract either.

606
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:30,140
You're crazy.

607
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:33,140
Hey.

608
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:36,140
Do you think my family will stay still if you touch me?

609
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:39,140
I'm so embarrassed.

610
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:43,140
I've been moving alone to solve it quietly.

611
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:46,140
Oh, my aunt is the head of the national tax office.

612
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:49,140
If you don't answer my phone, you'll have no time to stop me.

613
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:51,140
I'll give you a new door tomorrow.

614
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:53,140
What do you think?

615
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:56,140
I'll get hit by a million dollar tax bomb.

616
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:58,140
I'll be the head of the national tax office tomorrow.

617
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:03,140
You've improved a lot.

618
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:06,140
Threatening.

619
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:12,140
I learned it from you.

620
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:18,140
Do you like it?

621
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:28,140
I don't like it.

622
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:58,140
It's open.

623
00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:05,140
Wait a minute.

624
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:07,140
I have a safe application.

625
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:11,140
Okay.

626
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:19,140
I'll open the safe.

627
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:23,140
Is it working now, Mr. Hong?

628
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:33,140
Let's sign a contract.

629
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:36,140
Okay.

630
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:46,140
Should I sign it?

631
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:50,140
Okay.

632
00:52:50,140 --> 00:53:00,140
Okay.

633
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:11,140
It's over.

634
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:12,140
It's over.

635
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:14,140
Hey, is this going well?

636
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:16,140
Yes, it's for sure.

637
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:18,140
I'll take the data first.

638
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:19,140
Take it out.

639
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:22,140
Take it all out.

640
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:24,140
It's all thanks to you.

641
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:26,140
Oh, no.

642
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:30,140
I'm going to gather the evidence on my cell phone and put it in this bastard's cell.

643
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:31,140
Don't worry.

644
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:41,140
Yes.

645
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:43,140
You've had a hard time.

646
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:44,140
I'm going to contact the police.

647
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:45,140
Yes, thank you.

648
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:46,140
Thank you.

649
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:50,140
I've been thinking about it for a while.

650
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:52,140
Wounds, scars.

651
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:55,140
I want to help you with the treatment.

652
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:58,140
Thank you so much for your words.

653
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:00,140
I'm fine.

654
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:01,140
Are you really okay?

655
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:03,140
Yes.

656
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:11,140
Thanks to this scar, I was able to meet really good people and I think I was able to get the power to not give up.

657
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:16,140
So I'm fine with this scar.

658
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:18,140
Okay, okay.

659
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:19,140
See you soon.

660
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:20,140
Yes.

661
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:22,140
Yes.

662
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:23,140
I'll ask you to take good care of him.

663
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:24,140
Yes.

664
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:25,140
Yes, thank you.

665
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:29,140
Goodbye.

666
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:31,140
I'm glad it ended well.

667
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:35,140
I know.

668
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:40,140
I knew it would work out.

669
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:41,140
Oh, right, Gunwoo.

670
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:42,140
Huh?

671
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:47,140
Do you remember when the boss asked the head of the company about the ban?

672
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:50,140
Yeah, the ban is only known to the person who is the criminal?

673
00:54:50,140 --> 00:54:54,140
Yeah, how much do you think that will be?

674
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:56,140
Well.

675
00:54:56,140 --> 00:55:02,140
I think it will be several hundred billion won.

676
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:05,140
The money that the boss stole from that money is also in it, right?

677
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:06,140
Yeah.

678
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:15,140
If the police miss Kim Myeong-gil in this situation, Kim Myeong-gil will run abroad with that money and the ban.

679
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:16,140
That can't be.

680
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:18,140
That money is yours.

681
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:19,140
Let's get ready.

682
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:22,140
Let's chase him to the end and kill him.

683
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:32,140
Cool.

684
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:33,140
Oh, my God.

685
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:34,140
Hey!

686
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:35,140
Oh, my God.

687
00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:37,140
Jun-min, you did a great job.

688
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:38,140
Oh, my God.

689
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:40,140
Let's go to the second floor.

690
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:43,140
To the second floor.

691
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:44,140
What are you doing?

692
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:54,140
I think I smell something burnt.

693
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:24,140
Oh, my God.

694
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:59,140
Where are you?

695
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:00,140
I'm working late.

696
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:05,140
I'm going to call the reporter right now, so find me a person.

697
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:06,140
How many people?

698
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:08,140
First, one old man.

699
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:10,140
Did you see it?

700
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:16,140
If you find Jung-ho tomorrow, you'll get three times as much money.

701
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:26,140
Yes.

702
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:44,140
I'm going to call the reporter right now.

703
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:46,140
