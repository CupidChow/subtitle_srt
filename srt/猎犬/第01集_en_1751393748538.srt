1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:26,700
the

2
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,500
Sir, you need to wear a mask.

3
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,540
I'm sorry.

4
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,540
You need to wear a mask when you use the bus.

5
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,920
Please don't.

6
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,920
Please go down and wear a mask.

7
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,920
What do you mean a mask?

8
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,920
We're the best.

9
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,340
I don't want to wear a mask!

10
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:43,340
What do you think I am?

11
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:47,340
I'm a driver. I can't drive properly.

12
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,340
I told you to wear a mask.

13
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,800
What's wrong?

14
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,800
What's wrong?

15
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,800
What's wrong?

16
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,800
What's wrong?

17
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,800
What's wrong?

18
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,800
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,800
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,800
What?

21
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,800
What?

22
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,800
I'm sorry.

23
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,800
I think you need to go down.

24
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,800
I'm sorry.

25
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,800
I'm sorry.

26
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,800
What the hell?

27
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,800
I'm sorry.

28
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,800
What's wrong?

29
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,800
I'm sorry.

30
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,800
I'll make it up to you.

31
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,800
I'm sorry.

32
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,800
I'm sorry.

33
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,800
I'm so pissed.

34
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,800
I'm sorry.

35
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,800
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,800
I'm sorry.

37
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,800
I'm sorry.

38
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,800
Thank you.

39
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,800
Thank you.

40
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,800
I'm sorry.

41
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,800
I'm sorry.

42
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,800
I'm so sorry.

43
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,800
I didn't know it would be this long.

44
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,800
I'm so sorry for telling you this.

45
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,800
I'll try to do something next month.

46
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,800
Can you wait just one month?

47
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,800
I'll pay you back.

48
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,800
I'll try to do something next month.

49
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,800
Thank you.

50
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,800
I'm sorry.

51
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,800
Thank you.

52
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,800
We just need a quick response from you, Mr. Seoul.

53
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,800
Just the hotel workers who stayed in the U.S. for three minutes,

54
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,800
they don't have 3.5 million.

55
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,800
The foreign companies that are trying to take over this hotel

56
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,800
will not exist for at least three to four years.

57
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,800
There will be no more domestic companies.

58
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,800
You're saying it like a fact.

59
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,800
There are several friends who have led

60
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,800
50 companies in Korea around me.

61
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,400
I've been talking to my friends for a long time, so it's a fact.

62
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,800
No, it's just a fact.

63
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,700
It's true that you don't want to work with me, Mr. Bu.

64
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,100
Mr. Hong.

65
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,500
The money our bank lent to this building is 400 billion won.

66
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,600
It's not like we're trying to make a bet to get 300 billion won.

67
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,700
Shouldn't we be able to bear the loss in this situation?

68
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,700
Otherwise, how can we do business?

69
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,700
I'm not a businessman. I'm a banker.

70
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,800
Mr. Bu, I brought you here because...

71
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,400
Yes, yes.

72
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,100
I want the building to be completed as soon as possible for the safety of the city.

73
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,800
I'm very concerned about the market.

74
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,700
It doesn't make sense.

75
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,800
You're saying that I'm ridiculous, right?

76
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,800
What do you think makes sense?

77
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,300
I'm sorry. I'm a little late.

78
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,800
This is Mr. Kim, who I told you about before the meal.

79
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,300
Please say hello.

80
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:27,300
This is the person who introduced me to the mayor, Mr. Seo Woo-hyun.

81
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,300
I'm Kim Young-gil.

82
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,800
I'll call you later.

83
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:37,800
Yes.

84
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,800
I'm Kim Young-gil.

85
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,300
Yes.

86
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,300
I'm sorry, but what kind of work do you do?

87
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,800
I do a lot of investment work.

88
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,300
If good people call me, I go and help them get strength.

89
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,800
Are you a general manager?

90
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,300
Did you call a private sector worker?

91
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,800
The president is doing a lot of work.

92
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,300
Isn't it a place for private sector workers?

93
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,800
You're the president of Hongwoo-gun, right?

94
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,800
When I was young, I met a person named President Bang in Myeong-dong.

95
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,800
You may not remember because you were a baby,

96
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,800
but the IMF in Korea exploded,

97
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,800
and the I-group of 50 years of history had less than 6 billion,

98
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,800
so it was almost a disaster.

99
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:42,800
At that time, the president of Hongwoo-gun came to our president and asked for help.

100
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,800
He knelt down to save the company no matter what happened,

101
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,800
and the president was touched by his passion and sincerity.

102
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,800
I went to the house with 6 billion in my bag.

103
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,800
I remember my mother peeling a cold melon for me.

104
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,800
There is no bad money in the world.

105
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,800
It can be used in bad places.

106
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,800
It's good money if it's used in a good place.

107
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,800
I came here with a desire to help.

108
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,800
How much do you want to talk?

109
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,800
I was talking because there was a difference in the amount you think.

110
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,800
What's the difference?

111
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,800
1 billion.

112
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,800
Are you going to run the hotel yourself?

113
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,800
I've been working in Hong Kong for 4 years after finishing the management of the hotel in Switzerland.

114
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,800
Oh, you've prepared a lot.

115
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,800
Can I invest a little?

116
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,800
How much?

117
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,800
Since it's 1 billion, I have to invest 1 billion.

118
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,800
I'll do more if I need to.

119
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,800
What are the conditions?

120
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,800
There are only three conditions.

121
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:10,800
First, make a small casino on the top floor of the hotel.

122
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:16,800
As the hotel management is your dream, I also dream of opening a casino.

123
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:22,800
Second, help me set up a small bar under the hotel.

124
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,800
Lastly, when the corona virus spreads again,

125
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:32,800
Please open our hotel as a free quarantine space for people who don't have money.

126
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,800
I hope we can be kind to each other when we're having a hard time.

127
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,800
That's how we can have a better world.

128
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,800
I'm ready to invest 1 billion tomorrow.

129
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,800
I'm going to the hotel.

130
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,800
Did you do well?

131
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,800
Do you think you're going to cry?

132
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,800
Yeah.

133
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,800
Oh, yeah. Then I just have to worry about the interior of the store.

134
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,800
Hey, aren't you going to see the interior of the bar?

135
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,800
What are you going to see?

136
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,800
Pretty girls, do some scouting.

137
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,800
You're doing a lot of scouting, you bastard.

138
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,800
How nice is it to talk to a pretty girl like my sister?

139
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,800
What do you know, you idiot?

140
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,800
I'm going to wipe my face.

141
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,800
Oh.

142
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,800
Here?

143
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,800
Let's go.

144
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,800
What about the Seomun Building?

145
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,800
No one was connected to the police or the prosecutor among the new family members.

146
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,800
Did you check the master?

147
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,800
I missed it just once.

148
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,800
Your lover could be a cop.

149
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,800
You don't care about your brother, so do it right.

150
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,800
Oh, my sister, do it right.

151
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,800
Jang Do-yeon?

152
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,800
You should be polite to your sister-in-law.

153
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,800
Yes, I'm sorry, sir.

154
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,800
Apologize to me, you idiot.

155
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,800
I'm sorry, sister.

156
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,800
Let's go quickly. I'm craving alcohol.

157
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,800
Yes.

158
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,800
We will be with the 2020 KBC National Newcomer Competition.

159
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,800
Originally, the Newcomer Competition is a competition in which many audiences shout, love, and cheer for each other.

160
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:50,800
But due to the COVID-19 situation, it is a game without an audience, so the atmosphere is a little lonely.

161
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,800
That's right.

162
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,800
The Newcomer Competition is a game that many people are supported.

163
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,800
Let's go!

164
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,800
The third round of the Hong Woo-jin game has started.

165
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,800
It's a middle-class game.

166
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,800
Hong Woo-jin of the red trucker, and Jung Jae-hoon of the blue trucker.

167
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,800
Oh, both sides were good.

168
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,800
That's right.

169
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,800
Hong Woo-jin on the road.

170
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,800
Oh, hit both sides.

171
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,800
Oh, he's complaining.

172
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,800
Oh, he's complaining.

173
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,800
He's showing off his skills.

174
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,800
Try hitting him.

175
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,800
Yes.

176
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,800
Oh, he's a body shot.

177
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,800
Get in, get in.

178
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,800
He's not scared of the guy.

179
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,800
Oh, he's a good kicker.

180
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,800
Oh, it's a great kick.

181
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,800
Nice.

182
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,800
Wow, he's good at kicking.

183
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,800
Now, the game is the game between Kim Gun-woo and Kim Nae-ryeong.

184
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,800
Hey, Kim Gun-woo, the blue trucker.

185
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,800
Come on, Kim Gun-woo.

186
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,800
It's not right to hit and run!

187
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,300
Stop!

188
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,800
That's a perfect body!

189
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,800
That's right.

190
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,800
He's constantly fixing his posture.

191
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,800
The game's over.

192
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,800
That's right.

193
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,800
That was a one-shot game.

194
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,800
Kim Yeon-woo continues to fight back with one-shot.

195
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,800
That's a perfect body.

196
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,800
A scary rookie has appeared.

197
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,800
That's right.

198
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,800
That's right.

199
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,800
That's right.

200
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,800
That's right.

201
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,800
That's right.

202
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,800
That's right.

203
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,800
That's right.

204
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,800
That's right.

205
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,800
That's right.

206
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,800
That's right.

207
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,800
What's the score?

208
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,800
That's right.

209
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,800
Hong Woo-jin!

210
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,800
He's so excited.

211
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,800
Box!

212
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,800
Ah, as expected, the showman is a good player.

213
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,800
Hong Woo-jin.

214
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,800
He's good.

215
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,800
He's good.

216
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,800
He's good.

217
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,800
He's good.

218
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,800
Hong Woo-jin is good.

219
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,800
He's good at the rest of the game.

220
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,800
Stop!

221
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,800
Hong Woo-jin is going up again.

222
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,800
Kim Gun-ho and Lee Hyun-hee.

223
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,800
Kim Gun-ho.

224
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,800
Kim Gun-ho.

225
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,800
He's got a strong body.

226
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,800
He's good.

227
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,800
He's a good fighter.

228
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,800
He's a good fighter.

229
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,800
He's good.

230
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,800
Stop!

231
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,800
One, two, three.

232
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,800
Stop!

233
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,800
He's good.

234
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,800
He's good.

235
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,800
He's good.

236
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,800
That's right.

237
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,800
Kim Gun-ho and Hong Woo-jin.

238
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,800
Let's see who will take the trophy.

239
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,800
Don't try to cut your fist.

240
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,800
Short, short, with your waist.

241
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,800
Be careful of the left hook.

242
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,800
The punch is no joke.

243
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,800
Brother.

244
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,800
I'm a marine.

245
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,800
Be careful of the left hook.

246
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,800
I'm a mercenary.

247
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,800
Just hold it in and cry.

248
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,800
I'm going to kill you.

249
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,800
Let's go!

250
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,800
Thank you.

251
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,800
Good luck.

252
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,800
Take your seat.

253
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,800
He's been coming up really well.

254
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,800
Kim Gun-ho is a very different fighter.

255
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,800
That's right.

256
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,800
He's a fighter who's very good at fighting.

257
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,800
Kim Gun-ho.

258
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:05,800
Hong Woo-jin is a fighter who's good at outboxing and counterattacks.

259
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,800
Hong Woo-jin is a fighter who's good at playing games.

260
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,800
That's right.

261
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,800
He's very good at fighting.

262
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,800
He's going in.

263
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,800
He's pulling.

264
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,800
Can Hong Woo-jin come out?

265
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,800
He's coming out well.

266
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,800
Hong Woo-jin is really fast.

267
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,800
That's right.

268
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,800
Kim Gun-ho is a fighter who's good at fighting.

269
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,800
That's right.

270
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,800
He's going in.

271
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,800
He's pulling.

272
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,800
That's right.

273
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,800
He's pulling.

274
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,800
Hong Woo-jin is going in.

275
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,800
He's pulling.

276
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:00,800
Two, three, four, five.

277
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:05,800
Ten, seven, eight.

278
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,800
He's holding on.

279
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,800
He lost.

280
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,800
He's not shocked.

281
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,800
He's still in the back.

282
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,800
That's right.

283
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,800
Wow.

284
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,800
Come on!

285
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:28,800
We're going to experiment.

286
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:33,000
Does

287
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,800
really

288
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,000
change

289
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,800
your thoughts and

290
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,800
to

291
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:39,920
the

292
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,800
past.

293
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:46,800
Come on.

294
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,800
Come on.

295
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,800
Come on.

296
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,800
Come on.

297
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,800
Come on.

298
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,800
Come on.

299
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,800
Kim Gun-woo, the water of the sea.

300
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,800
He's getting more and more.

301
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,800
Let's go.

302
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,800
Come on.

303
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,800
Stop.

304
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:12,800
Oh, my God.

305
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,800
Okay.

306
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,800
Good.

307
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,800
Hey, Gun-woo.

308
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,800
Hey, Gun-woo.

309
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,800
Hey, Gun-woo.

310
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,800
Hey, Gun-woo.

311
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,800
Oh, my God.

312
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,800
Are you okay?

313
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,800
I didn't do anything in honor of the Marine Corps.

314
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,800
You always fall when you're hit.

315
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,800
I'm going.

316
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,800
Food is Corona.

317
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:44,800
No, you have to feed the child.

318
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,800
Go home and order.

319
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,800
Hi.

320
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,800
What? Why? What?

321
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,800
Do you want to eat?

322
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,800
Why should I eat with you?

323
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:33,800
I'm going to eat pork belly, so I'm going to eat with you.

324
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,800
Do you pity me?

325
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,800
No.

326
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,800
You told the others to eat.

327
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,800
They all went home.

328
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:45,800
Oh, my God.

329
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,800
Isn't the prize $10,000?

330
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,800
Yeah.

331
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,800
But why do you eat pork belly?

332
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,800
Let's eat.

333
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,800
I'm going to give it to my mom.

334
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,800
Why?

335
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,800
I have to give the rest to my mom.

336
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,800
Did you give it to your mom?

337
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,800
No.

338
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,800
But why?

339
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,800
I have to pay a little for my mom's store.

340
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,800
You're a good son.

341
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,800
Try 10,000 more.

342
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,800
The meat buffet I know is 29,000 won per person.

343
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,800
It's low quality, and it's Korean beef.

344
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,800
Really? Where?

345
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,800
It's a lie, Kyu-yong.

346
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,800
How did you pay 29,000 won for Korean beef?

347
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,800
Did you only work out for the rest of your life?

348
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,800
Anyway, it's okay.

349
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,800
Just use 10,000 won more.

350
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,800
Yeah.

351
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,800
Let's go.

352
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,800
Why is the left hand so strong?

353
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:54,800
I practiced hitting the tires with a hook when I was working at a car accident.

354
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,800
Just the left?

355
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,800
Why do you only hit the left?

356
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,800
I'm asking if you only hit the left.

357
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,800
Of course I hit both.

358
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,800
But why is your left hand so strong?

359
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,800
My right hand is stronger.

360
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,800
But why did you only use your left hand?

361
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,800
I didn't have time to use my right hand.

362
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,800
You're so annoying.

363
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,800
Why am I?

364
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,800
You could have dealt with everything with your left hand.

365
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,800
I did that today.

366
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,800
Look at that. You're so annoying.

367
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,800
No, I'm not. I'm talented.

368
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,800
Just flip the meat.

369
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,800
No, I have to stay for another 30 seconds.

370
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,800
You can flip it now.

371
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,800
No, I worked part-time at a pork belly restaurant. I know.

372
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,800
What the hell, you've worked so hard.

373
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,800
Poor?

374
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,800
Yeah, my house is ruined.

375
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,800
Why?

376
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,800
My father was a big company employee.

377
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,800
He filed a lawsuit for a defamation and lost in four years.

378
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,800
The lawyer's salary was all gone.

379
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,800
Big companies can't win.

380
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,800
The rich guys always win.

381
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,800
Right.

382
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,800
What did you do for a part-time job?

383
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,800
I did a lot of things, but I did the most deliveries with my mom.

384
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,800
You came from a part-time player village.

385
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,800
You're good at everything. You're good.

386
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,800
You're grilling meat with your right hand.

387
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,800
When did you start boxing?

388
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,800
About three years ago.

389
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,800
When was that?

390
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,800
After I went to the army.

391
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,800
I've been playing gloves since I was in sixth grade.

392
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,800
My father is a national team player.

393
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,800
Wow, awesome.

394
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,800
What's your father's name?

395
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,800
Hong Sung-geun.

396
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,800
Barcelona's bronze medalist.

397
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,800
Do you know him?

398
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,800
No.

399
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,800
Most people who box know him.

400
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,800
Sorry.

401
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,800
Did you learn boxing from your father?

402
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,800
I'm not close to my father.

403
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,800
Why?

404
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,800
My father doesn't get upset no matter what I do.

405
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,800
He won the bronze medal at my age.

406
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,800
He's evaluating me based on his standards.

407
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:03,800
Then your father won the bronze medal at the age of 25.

408
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,800
No, I was 27.

409
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,800
27.

410
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,800
How old are you?

411
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,800
27.

412
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,800
I'm sorry. I'm 25. I'm really sorry.

413
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,800
You punk.

414
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,800
I'm sorry.

415
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,800
Do it right from now on. Okay?

416
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,800
Okay.

417
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,800
Turn it over.

418
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,800
No, I have to stay one more minute.

419
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,800
It's okay. Turn it over.

420
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,800
No.

421
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,800
You're a punk.

422
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,800
You're a punk.

423
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,800
Did you go to the army?

424
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,800
Yes, I told you that I started boxing after I came back from the army.

425
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,800
I know.

426
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,800
I mean, where did you go?

427
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,800
You have to understand.

428
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,800
I'm a marine.

429
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,800
Hey, you're a marine too.

430
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,800
How many are you?

431
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,800
Yes, I'm a 1,207th.

432
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,800
I'm a 1,216th.

433
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,800
Why aren't you sleeping?

434
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,800
Sit down.

435
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,800
Sit down.

436
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,800
I'll sit down if you give me a salute.

437
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,800
Oh, okay.

438
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,800
Oh, Mr. Marine.

439
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,800
Yes?

440
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,800
Where did you come from?

441
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,800
Ilseoda.

442
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,800
Oh, me too.

443
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,800
Which university were you in?

444
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,800
Search.

445
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,800
Awesome.

446
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:23,800
I wanted to go into the search, but I fell.

447
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,800
Marine's flower.

448
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,800
Search.

449
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,800
Search.

450
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,800
Search.

451
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,800
I'll just call you brother, so let's do it comfortably.

452
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,800
Yes, sir.

453
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,800
Let's do it comfortably.

454
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,800
We'll do it comfortably.

455
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,800
Brother.

456
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:47,800
Hey, you're so talented.

457
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,800
Why?

458
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,800
I was a little punk in Incheon.

459
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:55,800
I went into the Marine Corps and met really good people and now I'm awake.

460
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,800
I'm having a hard time training, struggling, and overcoming.

461
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,800
I love this.

462
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:06,800
I wake up in the morning, run, sweat, shower, and wash.

463
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,800
It's not 5 degrees, is it?

464
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,800
No.

465
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,800
Try this.

466
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,800
How is it?

467
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,800
It's steak.

468
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,800
Really?

469
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,800
Hey, I'll show you.

470
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,800
I'll give you three.

471
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,800
I'll give you ssamjang.

472
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,800
I'll give you kimchi.

473
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,800
Brother, it's a bingo.

474
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,800
Ah!

475
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,800
It's amazing, right?

476
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,800
Do you want a drink?

477
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,800
Why?

478
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,800
Because of your body?

479
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,800
Oh, you perfectionist.

480
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,800
You're so annoying.

481
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,800
Excuse me.

482
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,800
Here.

483
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,800
Tesla.

484
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,800
One.

485
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,800
How much are your shoes?

486
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,800
120.

487
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,800
Really?

488
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,800
Why is it so expensive?

489
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,800
It's a rent for my house.

490
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,800
Hey, why are you so good at it?

491
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,800
Of course it's cheap.

492
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,800
It looks real.

493
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,800
This cheap one is the front car is smooth.

494
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,800
It's real suede.

495
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,800
The hole finish is a little rough.

496
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,800
Tell me if you want to buy it.

497
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,800
I'll find you something better than the real thing.

498
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,800
Really?

499
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,800
What do you mean, really?

500
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,800
Hey, the world is good.

501
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,800
There's nothing better than the real thing.

502
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,800
Let's play with your brother and learn the world.

503
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,800
You seem to be too busy.

504
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,800
Do you know this?

505
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,800
There are a lot of things like this these days.

506
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,800
Coronavirus special loan.

507
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,800
I used to run a little bit of work because I was so poor.

508
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,800
It's good to eat back as you get desperate.

509
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,800
Everyone gets desperate after the coronavirus.

510
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,800
The dead bodies are very excited.

511
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,800
Why?

512
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,800
Everyone is running to block the rent.

513
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,800
I'm sitting still, putting a straw in my mouth, and I'm bleeding.

514
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,800
My mom is really hard because of the rent at the cafe.

515
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,800
The sales used to be half and half, but the building owner still gets the rent.

516
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:11,800
If we catch it now, we'll have more tax, so we're just holding on.

517
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,800
They said they had to do it back to normal.

518
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,800
Hey.

519
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,800
I'll shoot you next time.

520
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,800
Do you eat a flower?

521
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,800
Go. There's a place with the butcher.

522
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,800
It's not a lie.

523
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,800
Hey, I'm not lying.

524
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,800
I think I'm going to hit you.

525
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,800
Can't you believe it?

526
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,800
You kept lying to me.

527
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,800
It was a joke.

528
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,800
Okay, I won't lie anymore.

529
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,800
Call.

530
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,800
I'm so sorry.

531
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:56,800
I should have done it this month, but I couldn't.

532
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,800
I'm sorry.

533
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,800
I'm sorry.

534
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,800
I'm sorry. I'll call you in the morning.

535
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,800
Mom.

536
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,800
Oh, yes.

537
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,800
Oh, my God.

538
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,800
You were so cool today.

539
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,800
Did you see it?

540
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,800
Of course I saw it.

541
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,800
The people at the office praised you a lot.

542
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,800
Really?

543
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,800
Yes.

544
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,800
I'm so sorry.

545
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,800
I'm sorry.

546
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,800
I'm sorry.

547
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,800
I'm sorry.

548
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,800
The people at the office praised you a lot.

549
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,800
Really?

550
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,800
Yes, they said it was perfect.

551
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,800
I should see it too.

552
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,800
Mom, wait a minute.

553
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,800
Oh, it's so nice.

554
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,800
This.

555
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,800
What's this?

556
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,800
The prize money.

557
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,800
It's a monthly fee.

558
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,800
I can't take this.

559
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,800
No, I'm taking this to give it to you.

560
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,800
Let's pay the money we borrowed from Uncle first.

561
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,800
Huh?

562
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,800
How did you know that?

563
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,800
Uncle is having a hard time, too.

564
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,800
Let's pay it back quickly.

565
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,800
Okay.

566
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,800
But I'll pay you back by paying the interest.

567
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,800
Okay.

568
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,800
Thank you.

569
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,800
It's okay.

570
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,800
Let's go, Mom.

571
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,800
Let's go.

572
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,800
Did you eat?

573
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,800
Yes, I ate.

574
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,800
Who?

575
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,800
My brother who played the final match with me today.

576
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,800
Oh, the one with curly hair?

577
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,800
Yes, that's right.

578
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,800
Did you eat?

579
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,800
Yes, I ate, too.

580
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,800
Mr. CEO.

581
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,800
How is it?

582
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:02,800
As you said, all the tenants have been fired from the bank or the financial system.

583
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,800
I'll try to get all of them to our company by next week.

584
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,800
Well, can't you do it by this week?

585
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,800
Keep in touch with the attorney general to get them out of here quickly.

586
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,800
I'll try.

587
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,800
Okay.

588
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,800
I'll try.

589
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,800
I'll try.

590
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,800
I'll try.

591
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,800
I'll try.

592
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,800
I'll try.

593
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,800
I'll try.

594
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,800
I'll try.

595
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,800
I'll try.

596
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,800
Okay, let's hurry up.

597
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,800
You know the sales team is the most important, right?

598
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,800
Yes.

599
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,800
Beom.

600
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,800
Let's get ready.

601
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,800
I'm Yoo In-young, the team leader from Smile Capital.

602
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:03,800
Our company is the top financial company selected by the government.

603
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,800
Could you please tell us if you have time?

604
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,800
Yes.

605
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,800
You don't have many customers these days, do you?

606
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,800
Yes.

607
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,800
Mr. CEO, you have 40 million won in bank loan money.

608
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,800
Yes.

609
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:22,800
If you sign here, we'll give you the money today.

610
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:26,800
And we get a 5% lower than 7% of bank interest.

611
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,800
Then you have nothing left.

612
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,800
Yes.

613
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:38,800
But this time, the government started a special support project for the people who are suffering from COVID-19.

614
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:42,800
Our capital has been able to get the package and lower the interest rate than other companies.

615
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,800
2% of interest is not a small amount.

616
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,800
In this time, holding on is winning.

617
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,800
Corona?

618
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,800
This will pass someday.

619
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:56,800
I want to help you a little bit.

620
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:03,800
We like this, but it's really good for my father.

621
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,800
Thank you.

622
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,800
Thank you.

623
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,800
What?

624
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:28,800
I ordered chicken with the kids at the gym last night, and the kid I ate with said he was confirmed.

625
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,800
Is it okay if I don't get tested?

626
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,800
You're fine.

627
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:37,800
But your game ended yesterday, why did you come to the gym today?

628
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,800
I came to the gym because I wanted to play.

629
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,800
I'm sorry.

630
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,800
I'm sorry.

631
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,800
I'm sorry.

632
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,800
I'm sorry.

633
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,800
I'm sorry.

634
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,800
I'm sorry.

635
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,800
I'm sorry.

636
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,800
Why did you come to the gym today?

637
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,800
I'm going to exercise.

638
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,800
Gun-woo, take a week off.

639
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,800
What do you do to rest?

640
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,800
It's not a rest if you do something.

641
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,800
Don't do anything and just rest.

642
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,800
Okay.

643
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,800
What are you doing?

644
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,800
Sleep.

645
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,800
Huh?

646
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,800
Sleep.

647
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,800
I can't hear you.

648
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,800
I'm sleeping.

649
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,800
I'm sleeping.

650
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,800
Do you want to stop exercising?

651
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,800
No.

652
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,800
I'm bored.

653
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:39,800
I'm tired of it from the morning.

654
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,800
Let's play.

655
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,800
I'm tired of it from the morning.

656
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,800
Let's play.

657
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,800
I'll give you the address.

658
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,800
Come.

659
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,800
Okay.

660
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,800
Come.

661
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,800
Stop!

662
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,800
You bastard!

663
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,800
Stop!

664
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,800
Are you okay?

665
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,800
Yes.

666
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,800
Oh, my.

667
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,800
What?

668
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,800
Why did you follow me?

669
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,800
Who sent you?

670
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,800
I'm going to help you.

671
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,800
What?

672
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,800
Who?

673
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:41,800
I thought you were the one who chased me.

674
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,800
Fuck!

675
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,800
He's a fake!

676
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,800
I'm not a fake.

677
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,800
I'm not a fake.

678
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,800
He's a fake!

679
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,800
If you don't know, don't be me.

680
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,800
Oh, my.

681
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,800
What's wrong?

682
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,800
What's going on?

683
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,800
My daughter Miyeon got a surgery yesterday.

684
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,800
Really?

685
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,800
What about the surgery?

686
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,800
She's fine.

687
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,800
She's recovering well.

688
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,800
It's all thanks to you.

689
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,800
You helped me out.

690
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,800
I'm so glad you're okay.

691
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,800
I'm so glad you're okay.

692
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,800
I'm so glad you're okay.

693
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,800
I'm so glad you're okay.

694
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,800
I'm so glad you're okay.

695
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,800
If you hadn't helped me,

696
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,800
Miyeon would have just sent me away.

697
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,800
This...

698
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,800
My husband was lucky enough to move to a big company.

699
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,800
So he got a refund.

700
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,800
I wanted to give it to you first,

701
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,800
so I ran to the bank as soon as I got the money.

702
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,800
Here.

703
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,800
Please give it to me slowly.

704
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,800
I'm in a hurry.

705
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,800
No, it's okay.

706
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,800
Please accept it.

707
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,800
I feel better now.

708
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,800
Thank you.

709
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,800
Thank you so much.

710
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,800
Thank you.

711
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,800
Thank you.

712
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,800
I'm sorry.

713
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,800
I found Yang Se-myeong's wallet.

714
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,800
He said he had no money.

715
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,800
I took it from him.

716
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,800
This is over 20,000 won.

717
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,800
But?

718
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,800
The money Yang Se-myeong borrowed is 10,000 won.

719
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,800
I forgot.

720
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,800
Are you hurt?

721
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,800
I was fighting Yang Se-myeong.

722
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,800
But I'm talking to you.

723
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,800
Let's talk.

724
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,800
What?

725
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,800
Why are you talking to me?

726
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,800
Why are you talking to me?

727
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,800
How long are you going to do this?

728
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,800
What?

729
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,800
Lending money without interest.

730
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,800
There's nothing left.

731
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,800
Why is there nothing left?

732
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,800
I give you 30% of the money for surgery.

733
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,800
Not me, grandpa.

734
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,800
You know Mi-yeon's mom, right?

735
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,800
So?

736
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,800
I came here earlier and took all the money with me.

737
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,800
Is that interest?

738
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,800
Hyun-jo.

739
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,800
The sick child got surgery and became healthy.

740
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,800
I lent him money.

741
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,800
The parents of the child didn't have to borrow money as a group.

742
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,800
So there's a house for the child to go back to.

743
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,800
We saved a family.

744
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:03,800
This is the most valuable interest in the world.

745
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:10,800
I heard about Yang Se-myeong.

746
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,800
Yang Se-myeong is doing his own cosplay.

747
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,800
He's getting a loan from the real homeless.

748
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,800
What are they doing?

749
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,800
They were in the same room as Yang Se-myeong.

750
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,800
They're not good quality.

751
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,800
You know that, but you went alone.

752
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,800
Shall I go with my grandfather next time?

753
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,800
Anyway, I'll dig a little.

754
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,800
I think there's something fun.

755
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,800
Don't touch the dangerous thing.

756
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,800
Yes.

757
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,800
Yes.

758
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,800
Is the phone okay?

759
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,800
Yes, tell me everything.

760
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,800
I'm looking for someone to ask for a favor.

761
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,800
Yes, wait a minute.

762
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,800
Tell me.

763
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,800
A good person.

764
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:12,800
It's good to know the skill of the guard and the skill of the worker.

765
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,800
Yes, sir.

766
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,800
I'll quickly reduce the number of good candidates.

767
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,800
Okay, I'll ask you.

768
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,800
Yes, loyalty.

769
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,800
Victory.

770
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,800
Mayweather is a must.

771
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:31,800
But Mayweather is more like a businessman than a player.

772
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,800
That's right.

773
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,800
He's trying to make money.

774
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,800
But he's good at it.

775
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,800
I'm sure he made a few thousand hundred million.

776
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,800
Money is important to you?

777
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,800
What's more important than money?

778
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,800
The heart of the boxer.

779
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,800
Why?

780
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,800
Why?

781
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,800
Why?

782
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,800
No, no.

783
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:03,800
I think I was a little embarrassed because you were suddenly serious.

784
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,800
Explain it to me.

785
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,800
The heart of the boxer.

786
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,800
I think Mayweather is the best.

787
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,800
Pow!

788
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,800
Pow!

789
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,800
It's cute.

790
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:14,800
Pow!

791
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,800
Hey, stay still.

792
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,800
I don't hang up when you talk.

793
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,800
I'm sorry, sir.

794
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,800
I will never hang up.

795
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,800
I think the heart of Mayweather is so cool.

796
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,800
I don't know how to give up.

797
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,800
Park Hyewon, I admit it.

798
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,800
But Mayweather made a lot of money.

799
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:33,800
But there are a lot more people who started dreaming of boxing after seeing Park Hyewon.

800
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,800
I did, too.

801
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,800
I want to be like that.

802
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:44,800
If you have strong will and a passion for not giving up, you can achieve your dream.

803
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,800
That's enough.

804
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,800
That's the heart of the boxer.

805
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,800
No, it's the heart that people feel while watching boxing games.

806
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,800
That's the heart of the boxer.

807
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:54,800
It's all cooked.

808
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,800
Let's eat.

809
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,800
Wow.

810
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,800
Is it delicious?

811
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,800
Yes, it's delicious.

812
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,800
How do you make money?

813
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:13,800
I taught the kids to exercise in my sister's kindergarten.

814
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,800
You're a PE teacher, right?

815
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,800
It doesn't suit you.

816
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,800
What are you talking about?

817
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,800
The kids love me.

818
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,800
Anyway, I ran that in the morning and worked out in the afternoon.

819
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,800
Now that the kindergarten itself is closed, it's hard.

820
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,800
Do you want to do delivery with me?

821
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,800
Delivery is no joke these days.

822
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:34,800
Do you make money?

823
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,800
Of course.

824
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:39,800
If you and I eat together, we can make about 20 dollars a day.

825
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,800
Really?

826
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,800
Yes, if you run a delivery, you'll be an aerobic pig.

827
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,800
And it has muscles that you don't use when you box, so it's very balanced.

828
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,800
Oh, it's a two-week contract.

829
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,800
It's a three-week contract.

830
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:50,800
Why?

831
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,800
You earn money, you're an aerobic pig, you're balanced.

832
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,800
Hey, aerobic and balanced are the same.

833
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,800
No, they're different.

834
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:02,800
Hey, you know, you won the rookie election this time.

835
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,800
Wasn't it going to be a super series as a representative of Korea?

836
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,800
Yeah, but it's been postponed because of Corona.

837
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,800
When is that?

838
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,800
I can't help it.

839
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:21,800
But I'm always ready to fight anytime.

840
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,800
You have a boxer's heart.

841
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,800
Come on, let's go outside.

842
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,800
Where's the real one?

843
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,800
I'm sorry.

844
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,800
Come here, come here.

845
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,800
Come here, come here.

846
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,800
Come here, come here.

847
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,800
Come here, come here.

848
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,800
Let's have a drink.

849
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:12,800
Today's main event, the world's largest show, the watermelon game with Inbeom.

850
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,800
Hey, get the money.

851
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,800
100 for not breaking.

852
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,800
300 for not breaking.

853
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,800
If you eat this today, I'll give it to you all.

854
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,800
Hey, I know you're going to break it, but I'll give you 400 for not breaking.

855
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:39,800
Inbeom, Inbeom, Inbeom, Inbeom.

856
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,800
Let's buy some tteokbokki.

857
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,800
Let's eat tteokbokki.

858
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:48,800
Let's eat.

859
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:49,800
Let's eat.

860
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,800
Inbeom, I did a good job.

861
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,800
Quiet, quiet, quiet.

862
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:04,800
Yes, sir.

863
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:13,800
Yes, sir.

864
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,800
I'll call you that.

865
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,800
Have a good night.

866
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:38,260
Our mayor will push the casino

867
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:48,260
I prepared a small gift for you today.

868
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:54,260
Open it.

869
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:02,260
It's a thousand dollars.

870
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:03,260
Yes, sir.

871
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:09,260
These turtles are very clean, so no one knows.

872
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:17,260
I prepared it because I wanted our relationship to last for a long time, so I'd appreciate it if you could accept it.

873
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:29,260
You're not just watching, are you?

874
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:32,260
I know you have a big dream.

875
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:37,260
You will need money to go to the National Assembly and the National Assembly.

876
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:39,260
Let's go to the end.

877
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:42,260
I'll push you.

878
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:47,260
I've never failed in my money.

879
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:00,260
Open it.

880
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:05,260
Where are you going?

881
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:06,260
Be careful.

882
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:08,260
I'll take you to the end.

883
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:09,260
Let's go.

884
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:17,260
When do you build the building?

885
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:23,260
There is a slight difference in each store, but this Friday, everyone's interest is more than 2,000.

886
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:25,260
I think it will be out if I hit it well.

887
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:27,260
I think it will be out if I hit it well.

888
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:35,260
Every time you go to work, if you see a completely destroyed store on the first floor, people will give up faster.

889
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:38,260
I'll do that, sir.

890
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:45,260
Team Leader Jung is not feeling well, so he can't move for a while, so he called and told me to send him when the good guys come.

891
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:48,260
The culprit will clean up.

892
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:49,260
There's nothing much.

893
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:53,260
Put on a suit and put on a mask.

894
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:55,260
I think five of you will hit it.

895
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:58,260
The CEO must have thought of everything.

896
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:01,260
I know.

897
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:03,260
I made a big mistake.

898
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:08,260
I'm going to hit you again.

899
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:12,260
So where do you want to hit it from?

900
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:24,260
I'm going to hit you again.

901
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:28,580
Oh,

902
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:49,960
I demonetized it.

903
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,460
Uh,

904
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:52,260
uh,

905
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:53,260
Oh,

906
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:56,260
Why aren't you keeping your promise?

907
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:57,260
Pardon?

908
00:48:57,260 --> 00:49:03,260
Instead of giving you a deposit, you promised to pay the extension fee.

909
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:05,260
Pardon?

910
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:15,260
You signed a 10% loan extension fee and said you'd do it in 24 hours.

911
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:20,260
There's a fortune in the extension fee.

912
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:25,260
The credit rating dropped, so the interest rate went up by 20%.

913
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:30,260
We started with a good heart.

914
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:35,260
Mr. Seo, you're a fool.

915
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:37,260
What are you going to do now?

916
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:43,260
Do you have money to get surgery?

917
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:45,260
I'm going to call the police.

918
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:47,260
