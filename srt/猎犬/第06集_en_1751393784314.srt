1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,920
The

2
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,560
brother onset

3
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,660
rather than

4
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,580
Flip it over and put it on the table so I can hear you.

5
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:28,780
You know what I mean, right?

6
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:39,820
I'll tell you the truth first.

7
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,120
What's wrong?

8
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,120
Don't make a sound and stay still.

9
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,160
Can you hear me?

10
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,760
Can you hear me?

11
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,860
Hey, do you want to die?

12
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,860
You're making a big mistake, you bastard.

13
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,160
Shut up.

14
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,320
Hey.

15
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:06,860
Be quiet.

16
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,860
I'll never let you sleep in my room again, you bastard.

17
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,260
Hey, shut up, you bastard.

18
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,360
You idiot.

19
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,960
You calmed down, right?

20
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,560
Don't you want to answer?

21
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,060
What do you want?

22
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:31,660
There must have been a report at Yeongmunpo Police Station today.

23
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:36,660
A motorcycle guy scratched a person's neck with a knife in an apartment basement parking lot and ran away.

24
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:37,860
Write down the number.

25
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,660
Seoul Gangdong A 6438.

26
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:47,060
It's a motorcycle number, but it's fake, so it won't be a good sign.

27
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:50,060
Find out where this motorcycle guy went.

28
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,760
Hey, if you want to find something like this.

29
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,160
It's hard and takes a long time.

30
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,460
That's why I'm asking you to do it.

31
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,260
It's ten o'clock now.

32
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,960
I'll give you five hours.

33
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,060
If you can't find it.

34
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:05,660
Your brother's strip show will be on the Internet.

35
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,860
Even if you sprinkle a random number in the middle, it will be on the Internet.

36
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:12,860
If you don't want to see the child group group and the bandit group tomorrow morning.

37
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:13,660
Do well.

38
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:18,660
What is it?

39
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,960
It's a death penalty.

40
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,760
Don't tell me, for the fried more's corrupt face.

41
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,460
Let's meet again.

42
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,360
Ah, fuck!

43
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:57,720
girl for the same

44
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,720
how have you been

45
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:21,400
why

46
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:32,760
I'm sorry.

47
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:32,840
Hello.

48
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:32,920
Yes.

49
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:41,760
Boil the body for a few days and when the bones are soft, grind it and pour it into the sea.

50
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,760
It's 1,500 won to treat one body like that.

51
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,760
I can't even find a bone.

52
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,760
What kind of person is boiling a bone soup?

53
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,760
Who did you hear that from?

54
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,760
I brought Seungdaegi to visit him.

55
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,760
How did he get out of the prison?

56
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,760
Prison is the fastest way to get information like this.

57
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,760
Are you guys all right?

58
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,760
Yes, we're fine.

59
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,760
You've had a hard time seeing what you can't see.

60
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,760
But what happens when the casino opens?

61
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,760
What do you mean what happens?

62
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,760
You're scratching Kim Young-gi's money, right?

63
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,760
Gun-woo.

64
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,760
Yes.

65
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,760
There are a lot of people addicted to gambling and drugs.

66
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,760
Kim Young-gil will connect the dead body with the casino.

67
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:29,760
The more people come to the casino, the more people use the dead body.

68
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,760
It's just that money comes in every day.

69
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,760
But only foreigners can go to the casino.

70
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,760
Does Kim Young-gil keep the law?

71
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,760
Yes.

72
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,760
Those who make money get it all back.

73
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,760
You can't make money in the law.

74
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,760
Kim Young-gil will buy a building with a loan if he makes money.

75
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:53,760
Then he'll get a loan as a collateral for the building and buy a bigger building.

76
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,760
You're a great bastard.

77
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,760
I'm going to make the casino harder to pay off the loan.

78
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:02,760
Smile Capital will take more people.

79
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:12,760
It's Kim Young-gil's kingdom.

80
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,760
Myeong-gil stole the money from me.

81
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,760
That's over 20 billion won.

82
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:28,760
If we get it back, shall we travel the world together with Gunwoo and Woojin?

83
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:32,760
You have enough money right now.

84
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:38,760
But we can't get out because of the corona.

85
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,760
What?

86
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,760
Let's go to Rome.

87
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,760
Why Rome?

88
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,760
I watched a movie called Rome's Holiday when I was 20.

89
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:57,760
I made up my mind that I would go if I made a lot of money later, but I haven't.

90
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:05,760
I just want the three of you to go together.

91
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,760
I'll buy you everything you want.

92
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,760
Grandpa, Italy has a lot of expensive things.

93
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,760
It's a luxury country.

94
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,760
Hey, you punk.

95
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,760
I'm Choi Tae-ho.

96
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,760
I'll show you how to spend your money.

97
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,760
Grandpa, that's called flex.

98
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,760
Yeah, well, I'll show you flex.

99
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:36,760
I'm not showing you, I'm just flexing.

100
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:42,760
Flex.

101
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:52,760
Yeah, let's finish this and go together.

102
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,760
Yes, sir.

103
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,760
Yes, sir.

104
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,760
Yes.

105
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:14,760
The boss wants to have a simple drink at home.

106
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,760
I guess you're in a good mood.

107
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,760
Do you guys drink?

108
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:30,760
All right.

109
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:17,760
Let's see a little faster.

110
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,760
There's two times faster and four times faster.

111
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,760
Let's see twice.

112
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:28,760
Yes.

113
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:38,760
If I were Kim Myeong-gil, I would have moved the hard to a safer place, thinking that the executive director had released all his weaknesses.

114
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,760
Did he have the freedom to do that?

115
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,760
We've tied up Kim Myeong-gil's arms and legs.

116
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,760
There's no one else but that team leader Jung.

117
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:54,760
And I don't think Kim Myeong-gil will leave that crime to anyone.

118
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,760
But there's no need to move it far.

119
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,760
We can't find it even if we hide it in the car trunk.

120
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,760
I know it's Kim Myeong-gil.

121
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,760
You're right.

122
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:09,760
If we make Myeong-gil's enemy our bodyguard, the whole world will bow to us.

123
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,760
Then we need a hard.

124
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,760
There's going to be a lot of people who have weak points against Myeong-gil.

125
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:20,760
They're like us.

126
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:27,760
Among them, there will be a lot of people who are strong like the eldest son of the I-L group.

127
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,760
It's going to be a long fight, and it's going to be a disadvantage to us.

128
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,760
Myeong-gil must have put his feet in a lot.

129
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:41,760
Police, prosecutors, politicians who can live with money, they must have bought it all.

130
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,760
It's not good for us if we get nervous for a moment.

131
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,760
Yes.

132
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,760
We caught all three of Kim Myeong-gil's subordinates, right?

133
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,760
Yes.

134
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,760
If you look too long, you'll get nervous.

135
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,760
I think we're all doing well.

136
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,760
There's no one hurt.

137
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,760
That's right.

138
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,760
Let's do it one by one.

139
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,760
We can catch Kim Myeong-gil and break down the company.

140
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:15,760
And anyway, Kim Myeong-gil must have been in a fight because he fell for Im Jang-do and Kim Jun-min.

141
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,760
That makes sense.

142
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:23,760
Well...

143
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,760
Yes.

144
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,760
Boss, senior.

145
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:35,760
For the sake of everyone's safety and common goals, I'll make a toast.

146
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:41,760
If I say, let's find the bottom line, Kim Myeong-gil is over.

147
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,760
I'd appreciate it if you could shout it out.

148
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,760
Then I'll start.

149
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,760
Please listen to everyone's glass.

150
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,760
Let's find the bottom line.

151
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:59,760
Kim Myeong-gil is over.

152
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:23,760
Kim Myeong-gil is over.

153
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:33,760
Let's find the bottom line.

154
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,760
Yeah, go over to the central police station.

155
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,760
They went from Dongpo to the central station.

156
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,760
Can you find it by 3 o'clock?

157
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,760
If you stopped at the central station, you'd find it soon.

158
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:58,760
If you went over to another place, you'd have to look for it more.

159
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,760
I'm counting on you.

160
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,760
Don't worry.

161
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,760
First, listen to what he wants.

162
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:09,760
After we stop this one, I'll think of a way to get rid of this guy.

163
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,760
Thank you so much.

164
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:16,760
Lim Beom, do you think you'll leave the guy who touched my family alone?

165
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,760
Don't worry.

166
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,760
Huh?

167
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,760
I'll really trust you.

168
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,760
Don't drink a lot, okay?

169
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:33,760
Yeah.

170
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,760
Why did you drink so much while you were doing your homework?

171
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,760
I guess I felt good today.

172
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,760
I'm sleepy. What about you?

173
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,760
I'm going to go downstairs.

174
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,760
Aren't you tired?

175
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,760
Yeah, it's okay.

176
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,760
You did a great job today.

177
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,760
Yeah.

178
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,760
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

179
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,760
I'll be right back.

180
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,760
I'll be right back.

181
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,760
I'll be right back.

182
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,760
I'll be right back.

183
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,760
I'll be right back.

184
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,760
I'll be right back.

185
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,760
I'll be right back.

186
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,760
You did a great job today.

187
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:08,760
Yeah.

188
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,760
Geon-woo.

189
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,760
Geon-woo.

190
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,760
Aren't you going to sleep?

191
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,760
Why aren't you sleeping?

192
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,760
I'm drinking with everyone downstairs.

193
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,760
You too?

194
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:25,760
Yeah, I don't eat.

195
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,760
I'll make you a cup of coffee in the morning.

196
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,760
Yeah, sleep more.

197
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,760
I'll close the door and go out.

198
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,760
Yeah, good night.

199
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,760
Good night.

200
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:56,760
It's been a while since I went to middle school.

201
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,760
Is it a girl?

202
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,760
Yeah.

203
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:05,760
Who's going to call you at this hour?

204
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,760
Tell me.

205
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,760
Brother.

206
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,760
I'm going to be a dad.

207
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,760
When?

208
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:22,760
My daughter is coming out next month.

209
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,760
It's been over three years since I met my mother.

210
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,760
You should have told me if you were with your family.

211
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:35,760
Then I wouldn't have told you to come out.

212
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,760
Go in quickly.

213
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,760
I'll be the last one to go.

214
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,760
No, I haven't had a drink with my brother in a long time.

215
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,760
Go in.

216
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,760
Oh, my God.

217
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,760
Hey.

218
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,760
Oh, it's okay.

219
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,760
I'm not giving it to you.

220
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,760
I'm going to buy Jaesoo's meat.

221
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,760
The pregnancy product is important.

222
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,760
Hurry up.

223
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,760
What's this?

224
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,760
Aren't you going down?

225
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,760
Yeah, I'll go in.

226
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,760
Yes, I'll go down first.

227
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,760
Yeah.

228
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,760
Call a taxi.

229
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:16,760
Cover the mask while you wait.

230
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:22,760
Thank you.

231
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:27,760
What are you talking about?

232
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,760
Oh, my brother.

233
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:37,760
I'm going to take a nap when I get in.

234
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:43,760
Hyunju said she'd go to bed first.

235
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,760
Are you okay?

236
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:52,760
Yes.

237
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,760
You're worried, aren't you?

238
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,760
I taught you the way.

239
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,760
It's my responsibility.

240
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:07,760
I didn't have the courage to fight because my body was broken.

241
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:17,760
All I could do was take care of Hyunju.

242
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:47,760
Hyunju.

243
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:17,760
Who are you?

244
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:27,760
I'm your dad's friend.

245
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:37,760
Dad.

246
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:47,760
Dad.

247
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:02,760
Hey, fill up the hallway with the best thing.

248
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,760
Yes.

249
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,760
Call about 10 kids and keep them up all night until the end of the day.

250
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,760
Should I fill up the ceiling?

251
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,760
No, it's because I'm keeping it empty.

252
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,760
Tell them to eat.

253
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,760
Yes.

254
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,760
Sir, I think you left your scarf behind.

255
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,760
No, I didn't.

256
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,760
Why did you kill yourself?

257
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:31,760
Delivery at dawn, assembly at the fan factory all day, and running away at night.

258
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:36,760
You worked all night to save your daughter, and you only slept for three hours and endured for two years.

259
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,760
Now that the baby's born, why do you want to kill yourself?

260
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,760
There's no reason.

261
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,760
I told you to pay back the money because you don't have to take it now when you lend me money.

262
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:56,760
I'll give you an unlimited loan if you need a period.

263
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,760
I'll find out.

264
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:08,760
I don't understand.

265
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:14,760
Excuse me.

266
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:24,760
It's on the third floor.

267
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,760
Excuse me.

268
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,760
You scared me.

269
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:33,760
Are you going to Cha Sang-woo's funeral?

270
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:38,760
Yes.

271
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:50,760
When I was in the back surgery two years ago, my father was throwing away the garbage in my house for three months.

272
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,760
There was no one who worked so hard.

273
00:19:54,760 --> 00:20:00,760
I was so heartbroken when I was sick without my mom.

274
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:06,760
I was feeding you and filling the refrigerator with side dishes.

275
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:10,760
Why did you kill yourself when you were all born?

276
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:14,760
It's all because of those four-body scumbags.

277
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:20,760
I came to you all the time and hit you with a person's collar.

278
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,760
What do you look like?

279
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:32,760
One guy is as big as a bear and the other guy is tall.

280
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:38,760
A month later, the person I lent money to committed suicide.

281
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:44,760
He was the one who lent me money because his family was sick.

282
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:48,760
I'm going home too soon.

283
00:20:48,760 --> 00:21:01,760
Watch the stairs.

284
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,760
Bye.

285
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,760
Go in.

286
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:14,760
Good night.

287
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,760
Later, Yang Joong found out.

288
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:23,760
I lent money to people for family treatment.

289
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,760
Myung-gyu is like a son-in-law.

290
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:35,760
He said he ordered me to do it, and he took out a few hundred loans every month.

291
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:40,760
My mother was also in the same situation.

292
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:48,760
He hid that in the contract.

293
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,760
I'm sorry.

294
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,760
A lot of people got hurt because of me.

295
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:59,760
No, you don't have to feel sorry for me at all.

296
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:05,760
I think you feel more guilty because you are responsible.

297
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,760
Real cowardly people don't feel guilty.

298
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:14,760
They always blame others and bully people who are weaker than them.

299
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:21,760
I think all the people here are gathered because of the good heart that the boss gave them.

300
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:30,760
I don't think the boss bought a orphanage for Hyun-joo, but I really believe in you.

301
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:37,760
We'll work together to catch Kim Myung-gyu, so don't be too painful.

302
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:47,760
I hope you stay healthy.

303
00:22:53,760 --> 00:23:03,760
After this, I'll set up a boxing gym for you so you can focus on exercise until you become a champion.

304
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:08,760
And I'll set up a big cafe on the first floor.

305
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,760
I'm free until I die.

306
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,760
Yeah.

307
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,760
I don't know what to say.

308
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,760
Yes.

309
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:26,760
Thank you.

310
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,760
Thank you, boss.

311
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:34,760
No, I'm thankful to you.

312
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:39,760
I learned youth from you.

313
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:44,760
This is flex.

314
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,760
How is it?

315
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:52,760
Yes.

316
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,760
Let's take a look over there.

317
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,760
Here?

318
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,760
No, next to it.

319
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:12,760
Yes.

320
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,760
One minute later.

321
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:29,760
Yes.

322
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,760
Thank you.

323
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,760
Yes.

324
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:50,760
Yes.

325
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,760
I'm 88 today.

326
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,760
Are you done?

327
00:24:54,760 --> 00:25:07,760
Thank you for your hard work.

328
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,760
Let's go.

329
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:30,760
Let's go.

330
00:25:50,760 --> 00:26:00,760
Let's go.

331
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:28,760
Let's go.

332
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:44,760
I guess the president has a sore throat.

333
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:49,760
It's reduced to salt water.

334
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,760
Did Jang Dong-wook release it?

335
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:55,760
I don't know.

336
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,760
It's safer to think that it's released at times like this.

337
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:05,760
Let's catch Chairman Choi.

338
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:11,760
Yes.

339
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:28,760
Chairman Choi.

340
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,760
Don't be so excited and kill me.

341
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,760
Do you have anything to ask?

342
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,760
Yes.

343
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:44,760
Except for that.

344
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:26,760
Someone must have come.

345
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,760
Who is it?

346
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,760
Yes, I'm from the basement.

347
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,760
My house is on the roof.

348
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:39,760
Can I go in for a minute and take a look at the bathroom?

349
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,760
Just a moment.

350
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,760
My house is on the water.

351
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:47,760
The kids can't sleep.

352
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,760
I'll ask you to do something.

353
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,760
Now?

354
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,760
Yes, I'll be there in a minute.

355
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:11,760
I'll just check it out.

356
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,760
Honey.

357
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,760
Who is it?

358
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:22,760
Water is dripping from the bottom floor.

359
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:37,760
Come out.

360
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:47,760
Wait a minute.

361
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:59,760
Honey, call the police and report that you were robbed.

362
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,760
Yes.

363
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,760
I'll explain later.

364
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,760
Do you trust me?

365
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:15,760
No matter what happens, you can't open the door.

366
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,760
It's okay.

367
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:25,760
It's okay.

368
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:35,760
Honey.

369
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:45,760
Honey.

370
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:55,760
Oh, my God.

371
00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:05,760
Dongjak High School, 3rd floor.

372
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,760
Please open the door.

373
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:20,760
My husband is in danger.

374
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,760
Hey, go ahead.

375
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,760
Go ahead.

376
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:33,760
What the hell?

377
00:31:52,760 --> 00:32:02,760
What the hell?

378
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:32,760
What the hell?

379
00:32:52,760 --> 00:33:02,760
What the hell?

380
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:30,760
I'll save your woman.

381
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:40,760
I keep my promise.

382
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:50,760
I'll be right there.

383
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,760
Good night, sir.

384
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,760
Good night.

385
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,760
Did you sleep well?

386
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:19,760
Yes.

387
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:24,760
Welcome.

388
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,760
We're in this situation.

389
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,760
Yes, there are a lot of people.

390
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,760
Get up, brother.

391
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:36,760
Let's eat.

392
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:41,760
Thank you.

393
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,760
He's not coming.

394
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,760
Where is he coming from?

395
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,760
I told him to eat and sleep.

396
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,760
Woojin ate yesterday, right?

397
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,760
Yes.

398
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,760
You said you drank well, but you're drunk alone.

399
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,760
Let's eat.

400
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,760
Thank you for the food.

401
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:05,760
Thank you for the food.

402
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,760
Geon-woo.

403
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,760
Yes.

404
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,760
When are you going to take your mother to the orphanage?

405
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,760
I'll do it.

406
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,760
Grandpa, please lend me a car.

407
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,760
You've been standing there for a long time.

408
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,760
It might be dangerous, so be careful.

409
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,760
Okay, I'll do it.

410
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,760
Shall we eat and go?

411
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,760
If it's now, it's over in an hour.

412
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,760
Mom, are you okay?

413
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:35,760
I think it would be more comfortable to stay here and eat.

414
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,760
Madam.

415
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:45,760
If you don't mind, could you help us with the orphanage?

416
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,760
Madam, I love your food.

417
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:52,760
I think our children will love it.

418
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:59,760
The food is really good.

419
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:06,760
Mom, I think that would be good, too.

420
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,760
If it helps.

421
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,760
Thank you.

422
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:20,760
Thank you.

423
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:30,760
Can you eat well without Mom?

424
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:39,760
Yeah.

425
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,760
You can't eat well.

426
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:49,760
Yeah.

427
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:54,760
Don't worry too much.

428
00:36:54,760 --> 00:37:04,760
I'm a girlfriend.

429
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:34,760
Lidong.

430
00:37:54,760 --> 00:38:04,760
Lidong.

431
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,760
How did you find it?

432
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,760
What?

433
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:36,760
Did Lee Du-young tell you?

434
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,760
Did Du-young touch a woman?

435
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,760
What?

436
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:52,760
Did you kill him?

437
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:22,760
What?

438
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:52,760
What?

439
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:22,760
What?

440
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:52,760
What?

441
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:22,760
What?

442
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:52,760
What?

443
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:22,760
What?

444
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:52,760
What?

445
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:22,760
Let's go.

446
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:52,760
What?

447
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,760
Boss.

448
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,760
Kim Myeong-kyu's sons are here to see you.

449
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:05,760
What are you talking about?

450
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,760
Let's go to the basement.

451
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:17,760
I'll be here, so go to the chase.

452
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,760
Hey, Woojin.

453
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:29,760
Hey, Woojin, hurry up.

454
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:39,760
Hey, Woojin.

455
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:47,760
Hey, Woojin.

456
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,020
Run away.

457
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:22,900
May I rescue the prince and princess.

458
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:30,000
Run!

459
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:39,000
Get up!

460
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:55,080
They even

461
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:04,180
keep shooting each other.

462
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:06,180
Oh, my God.

463
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:36,180
Oh, my God.

464
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:07,180
Woojin.

465
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:09,180
Woojin.

466
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:27,180
Woojin.

467
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:36,180
Woojin.

468
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:00,180
You're an idiot.

469
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:06,180
Oh, my God.

470
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:18,180
Where?

471
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:20,180
This way.

472
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:22,180
Put some oil on it.

473
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:30,180
Blood.

474
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:36,180
Put some oil on it.

475
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:48,180
Good job.

476
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:59,180
You're a very thankful person.

477
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:01,180
Here.

478
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:06,180
I gave you a dream.

479
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:19,180
So I'll let you go without hurting you.

480
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:21,180
It's okay.

481
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:24,180
It'll be over soon. It's okay.

482
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:26,180
It's okay. It's okay.

483
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:28,180
Yeah, yeah.

484
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:34,180
It's okay.

485
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:36,180
It's okay.

486
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:03,180
Oh, my God.

487
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:21,180
Dad.

488
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:36,180
Dad, go to the back door.

489
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:50,180
Hey!

490
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:04,180
Hey!

491
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:34,180
Hyunju!

492
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:36,180
Hyunju!

493
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:48,180
Grandpa.

494
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:52,180
Grandpa.

495
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:54,180
Grandpa.

496
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:56,180
Grandpa.

497
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:58,180
Oh, my God.

498
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:00,180
Grandpa.

499
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:02,180
Dad.

500
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:06,180
Get up.

501
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:12,180
Grandpa.

502
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:14,180
Grandpa.

503
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:16,180
Grandpa.

504
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:18,180
Grandpa.

505
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:20,180
Grandpa, get up.

506
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:22,180
Dad.

507
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:24,180
Dad, help me.

508
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:26,180
Dad, help me.

509
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:28,180
I'm sorry.

510
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:30,180
I'm sorry.

511
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:31,180
You have to get out.

512
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:33,180
No, I can't.

513
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:35,180
No, get up.

514
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:36,180
You're going to die.

515
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:38,180
I'm sorry.

516
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:40,180
I'm sorry.

517
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:43,180
I'm sorry.

518
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:45,180
I'm sorry.

519
00:52:57,180 --> 00:53:02,180
Knife.

520
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:03,180
Suction.

521
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:25,000
Get me more

522
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:29,180
What should I do?

523
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:30,180
What should I do?

524
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:31,180
What's wrong with you?

525
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:32,180
What's wrong with you?

526
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:33,180
What's wrong with you?

527
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:35,180
What's wrong with you?

528
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:36,180
I'm A.

529
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:41,180
Follow me.

530
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:43,180
I'll save you no matter what.

531
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:45,180
Don't worry.

532
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:55,180
I'm sorry.

533
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:57,180
Bleeding is severe.

534
00:53:57,180 --> 00:54:00,180
Dr. Ma, please prepare enough blood.

535
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:02,180
I need more gauze.

536
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:05,180
Please get ready quickly.

537
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:06,180
It's done.

538
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:08,180
Can this save Hong Woo-jin?

539
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:11,180
No, I think I need a few more.

540
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:12,180
Can this save Hong Woo-jin?

541
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:16,180
No, I think I need a few more.

542
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:18,180
Then let me fill one more.

543
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:19,180
You've got 320ml.

544
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:20,180
It's dangerous if you do more.

545
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:21,180
I'm okay.

546
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:22,180
I'm a boxer.

547
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:23,180
I don't die this much.

548
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:24,180
I'm really okay.

549
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:25,180
No.

550
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:29,180
I really have to save my brother.

551
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:31,180
Let me fill one more.

552
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:32,180
Please.

553
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:33,180
