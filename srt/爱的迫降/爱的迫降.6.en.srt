1
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,971
ALL CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND BACKGROUND ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:55,931
You know,

3
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,560
why don't we get our photo taken?

4
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:01,728
I mean,

5
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:04,856
we won't see each other again
after I leave.

6
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:06,316
It will be a memento.

7
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:11,738
There is no need for us to remember

8
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:13,699
or keep a memento of each other.

9
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,744
You have a point.

10
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:20,664
I was just saying.

11
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,969
You get five passport photos.

12
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:35,304
And it's 5,000 won.

13
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:37,931
Can I get one more just in case?

14
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:40,183
One for your passport, one for a resume,

15
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,728
one for the Immigration Bureau,
one for Air Koryo,

16
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:45,981
and one extra photo
for an overseas posting.

17
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:48,984
It makes five. I'm sure it will be enough.

18
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,695
Still, can I just get one more?

19
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:54,031
COMMEMORATIVE PHOTO, PASSPORT PHOTO

20
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:02,497
I will do that.

21
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:03,832
I will send her your regards.

22
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:05,876
I think I will be able to do that.

23
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:12,007
You really are Yoon Se-ri!

24
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:17,387
-Come over here.
-But...

25
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:21,058
My gosh.

26
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:30,025
Who are you?

27
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:31,777
Well...

28
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:34,738
Hang on.

29
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:37,115
It looks like there is a little mix-up.

30
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,409
Se-ri, who is this guy?

31
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,411
He's someone I know.

32
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:46,291
Right. I'm someone she knows.
Se-ri's acquaintance.

33
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:54,007
I have chronic
shoulder dislocation on that side.

34
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,511
Name, Gu Seung-jun.

35
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:00,514
-Are you a British citizen?
-Yes.

36
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,891
Please let go of me first.

37
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,935
Why did you come to North Korea?

38
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,397
Why am I telling you all this?

39
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,691
Se-ri, please do something about him.

40
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:12,693
Who are you? Are you a cop?

41
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:14,111
Sir...

42
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,489
He's not a cop.

43
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,158
He's my bodyguard.

44
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,496
Let go of him,

45
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:26,456
Mr. Ri.

46
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,292
I told you to let go of him.

47
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,379
She told you to let go of me, Mr. Ri.

48
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:37,801
Once my bodyguard gets upset,
he wouldn't let it go easily.

49
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,302
Bad Mr. Ri.

50
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,763
Calm down and let go of his arm now.

51
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,317
I almost dislocated my shoulder.

52
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:01,825
What's happening?

53
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,661
I would've been shocked
if I met you even in Tokyo or New York.

54
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,204
But it's Pyongyang.

55
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:12,919
So tell me.

56
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:19,926
What made you come here, Se-ri?

57
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:23,764
Well...

58
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:26,850
Did you not hear about me from anyone?

59
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:30,645
Must you ask? She is dead.

60
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,566
No. Did something happen?

61
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:36,610
No.

62
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,111
The thing is...

63
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:44,951
I have something urgent to take care of.

64
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:47,078
Can I see you again

65
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:49,539
in the coffee shop at the lobby
at seven this evening?

66
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,082
-I'll be waiting.
-Okay.

67
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:54,669
Thank you for your work, Mr. Ri.

68
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:00,967
It's okay. I must say
you're good at your job.

69
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:03,720
Keep up the good work.

70
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:07,015
-Excuse me.
-I'll see you around.

71
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,892
I'm kind of in a hurry now.

72
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,520
I can't believe that I ran into you here.

73
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,730
This has to be destiny.

74
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,369
What can I say?

75
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,955
I can't tell him
that I'm engaged in North Korea.

76
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:32,624
And it's not like I lied.

77
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,627
You're protecting me
right now, Jeong Hyeok.

78
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,671
Not protecting
but keeping my eyes on you.

79
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,548
What's the difference?

80
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:41,800
They are clearly different.

81
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:45,178
I'm not a person who follows you around
to protect you.

82
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:47,681
Hello.

83
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:50,809
Like I said,

84
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:53,353
what I'm doing is strict supervision.

85
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:55,939
I'm, so to speak, like your superior.

86
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,943
How could you call me your bodyguard?

87
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,236
You should never say that.

88
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,453
Mr. Ri Jeong Hyeok.

89
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:13,164
This is what a bodyguard does.

90
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,348
Going for a meal, are you?

91
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:32,809
So a group of three
for an arrest here, too.

92
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,189
-Hey!
-A dog never bites its owner.

93
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:40,442
Watch out for your arm.

94
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,235
I'm a brown belt in jujitsu, you know?

95
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:44,446
Hey, don't get me wrong.

96
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:49,284
Come to think of it,
jujitsu is a one-on-one match.

97
00:06:58,835 --> 00:06:59,920
Damn it.

98
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:11,097
Those jerks.

99
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:13,767
They are really fast.

100
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:16,353
They are like sprinters.

101
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:28,865
I surrender.

102
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:35,830
How do you know him?

103
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,168
To tell you that,

104
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,837
I need to talk about my family history.

105
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:47,509
Did I tell you that I'm a daughter
of a big conglomerate?

106
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,595
You said that numerous times
until I could remember it.

107
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:52,847
For people like me,

108
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:55,350
a family has different meanings.

109
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:56,977
It's like...

110
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:59,854
Being a good daughter
is part of the business.

111
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,273
Even things like whom my father

112
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:05,110
had breakfast with can be business.

113
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:07,404
-Is that so?
-Yes.

114
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,948
It doesn't matter whether I'm good or not.

115
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,825
I have to be better than my brothers.

116
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,786
And my brothers have to be better than me.

117
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,455
So there's no way
we could have any siblinghood.

118
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,584
I just asked about your relationship
with the guy.

119
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,295
Just listen.

120
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,173
When you're sick of competition,

121
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,634
you might wish
your competitor would vanish.

122
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,554
I guess my brothers were like that.

123
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,181
So...

124
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:38,268
they decided to marry me off

125
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:39,978
to the guy we just met.

126
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,439
He's an overseas Korean.

127
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,607
It means my brothers wanted to

128
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,862
send me to another country.

129
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:52,282
To send me far away
so they won't have to see me.

130
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,869
So I won't take anything from them.

131
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:58,621
But I didn't do as I was told.

132
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,374
There's no way I'd do such a thing.

133
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:04,461
My brothers must be really excited by now.

134
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:07,589
They might think I'm dead.

135
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,468
You're being foolish.

136
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,889
This is about a life-and-death matter,
and you're their family.

137
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:18,141
I get that

138
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,685
you guys didn't get along well
and had some quarrel.

139
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:22,687
But you can't say such ruthless things.

140
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:25,273
They must be worried.

141
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:27,984
They must feel bad
that they didn't get along with you.

142
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,075
I'm sure they are waiting

143
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,786
for you to come back.

144
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:48,713
My goodness.

145
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:51,591
What's going on?

146
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:52,884
Gosh.

147
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:59,766
Hello? Dan? Are you there?

148
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,268
Comrade Ri Jeong Hyeok

149
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:04,062
is at Pyongyang Hotel

150
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:06,147
<i>with some woman, do you know that?</i>

151
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:08,858
Of course I do.
He's coming to Pyongyang today.

152
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:11,528
And I know the woman who's with him.

153
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,446
I'm meeting them later today.

154
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,450
Thank you for your concern.
Okay. I'll see you later.

155
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,001
Please get these off, ma'am.

156
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:28,503
I have to be somewhere.

157
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:29,671
Okay.

158
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:32,590
Where are you going?

159
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:33,800
I have an appointment

160
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:35,635
with Jeong Hyeok.

161
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:36,553
Really?

162
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,596
Is he in Pyongyang again?

163
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,597
Yes.

164
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:41,975
So I was thinking, Mom.

165
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:46,354
We should have dinner
with Jeong Hyeok's parents tonight.

166
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:49,774
Oh, that's a good idea.

167
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:51,442
You should give them a call then.

168
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,194
Tonight at seven,

169
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,114
at the restaurant in Pyongyang Hotel.

170
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,115
Okay.

171
00:10:57,198 --> 00:11:00,118
I'll make an appointment. Don't worry.

172
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,328
Then I'll go meet with Jeong Hyeok first.

173
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:06,374
All right. You can go out for a walk
and enjoy the autumn leaves with him.

174
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:09,711
Ma'am.

175
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:10,879
I should look

176
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:12,922
gorgeous today.

177
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,510
Then let's cut right to the chase.

178
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:19,554
Yes, please make it

179
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:21,014
revolutionary.

180
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:26,102
I surrender. I'm on my knees now.

181
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:27,812
I surrender. Please stop it.

182
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:29,856
A gun?

183
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:34,485
I'm really sorry, sir.

184
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:38,031
I'm reflecting deeply on what I did.

185
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:41,242
Forget it. There's no room
for reconsideration.

186
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:43,369
<i>Please think twice</i>
<i>before you do something to me.</i>

187
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,079
<i>In return,</i>

188
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:49,042
I'll tell you some big news
which is good for you.

189
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,252
Are you trying to fool me again?

190
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:53,338
The phone, please.

191
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:55,423
Thank you.

192
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:01,221
You thought Se-ri was dead,

193
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:02,805
but she's alive.

194
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:06,100
What did you just say?

195
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:09,520
Se-ri. She's still alive.

196
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:10,855
You jerk.

197
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:12,774
Don't you dare lie to me.

198
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,067
I'm serious.

199
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:16,402
I saw her.

200
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:20,323
Where did you see Se-ri?

201
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:21,824
Where is she now?

202
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,119
Which one is my room?

203
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,683
Are these bugging devices--

204
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,036
My goodness.

205
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:50,788
You can talk now.

206
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:55,084
Are these bugging devices?

207
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:58,713
All the rooms in this hotel
have those devices installed.

208
00:13:58,796 --> 00:13:59,964
All the rooms?

209
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:01,382
Probably.

210
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:05,803
Are you sure you got rid of them all?
I'm still nervous.

211
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:08,473
I stay in the next room,
so if you have any problem--

212
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,141
Okay. I'll call you immediately.

213
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,351
No.

214
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,020
Don't call me
unless it's a very serious problem.

215
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:16,814
Wait.

216
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,775
When do I get my photos?

217
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,109
Tomorrow morning.

218
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:21,986
Am I getting my passport tomorrow as well?

219
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:25,740
All the members will get their passports
right before the departure.

220
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:27,867
I see.

221
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:28,993
But

222
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,788
could I do well and not get caught?

223
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,167
It will be important
that you keep a low profile.

224
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,669
-And stay quiet.
-I mean,

225
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,757
I stand out and attract people's attention
even when I take a breath.

226
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:45,218
I'm like Triton among minnows.

227
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:47,720
I'm worried.

228
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:50,473
I guess you should take a nap.

229
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,017
You seem to be out of your mind.

230
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,019
What? I'm not.

231
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:57,814
Do you think

232
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:01,025
I should meet Seung-jun
and ask him a favor?

233
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:03,861
-About what?
-He says he's here for business.

234
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,613
It means he will leave.

235
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:07,949
It'd be the best
if I could leave with him.

236
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,118
If it doesn't work,

237
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:14,122
he can at least tell my family about me.

238
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:15,456
How could you trust him?

239
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,418
You're probably right.

240
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:22,130
But like Seung-jun said,
the fact that we met again here

241
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:24,549
could be because of a peculiar destiny.

242
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:29,095
Do you think destiny is that simple?

243
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,556
I almost got married to him,

244
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,975
and I met him again here.
It's not that common.

245
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:38,146
Then, for instance...
I mean, this is just an example.

246
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:40,898
You fell from the sky all of a sudden
and I found you.

247
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:43,651
You ran away
but ended up in front of my house.

248
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:45,403
-It's just a coincidence--
-What?

249
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,947
That's not it.
What you said is a coincidence.

250
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:49,574
Well...

251
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,744
Why are you being so competitive
for something like this?

252
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:59,250
That's not what I meant.

253
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:00,877
I was just clarifying the distinction

254
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,754
-between destiny and coincidence.
-What?

255
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:07,508
Jeong Hyeok, do you want to be my destiny?

256
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:09,469
-It's not like that.
-Fine.

257
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:11,929
Let's say destiny brought us together.
Let's put it that way.

258
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:13,139
You don't have to do that.

259
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:16,642
After all, this is
a cross-border encounter

260
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:17,810
We can say that.

261
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:19,645
I said you don't have to.

262
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,026
Do you have a guest
named Ri Jeong Hyeok registered here?

263
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:26,235
Tell me his room number.

264
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:29,655
I'm sorry, but I can't tell you that.

265
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:30,656
I bet you can.

266
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:39,290
It's me. I'm at your hotel now.

267
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,460
I'm here to find out something,
so I need your help.

268
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:48,591
Hello?

269
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:50,510
Okay.

270
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:52,053
Yes, I will.

271
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,348
Please say the name again.

272
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:56,641
Ri...

273
00:16:57,308 --> 00:16:58,351
Jeong...

274
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,144
Hyeok.

275
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,814
He booked two rooms.

276
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:04,815
Tell me them both.

277
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,289
You left your key.

278
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:25,253
If things like this happen twice in a row,

279
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:27,213
I should be upset, right?

280
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,882
I guess you should.

281
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,511
Someone told me she saw you here,
so I came to make sure.

282
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,388
How did you know I was in this room?

283
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:38,391
The son of the hotel owner chased after me
when I studied in Russia.

284
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:39,642
Well...

285
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,310
I understand

286
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:44,230
this can be misleading.

287
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:47,858
But for your information,
we're staying in separate rooms--

288
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:49,735
I don't want to know,
and I didn't ask you.

289
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:54,365
Right, you don't want to know.

290
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:55,992
Then...

291
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,453
I'll leave you two to talk.

292
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,248
I should get going.

293
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:04,875
Do you want me to stand here all day?

294
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,315
She's not going to kill him, is she?

295
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,028
Why did you not give me a call?

296
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,447
You're the one
who should've given me a call.

297
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:39,118
You were seen in Pyongyang Hotel,
and you were with a woman.

298
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:42,580
Do you know how I felt
when I heard things like that?

299
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:46,042
I'm sorry I embarrassed you.

300
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:49,920
So I put you on the spot as well.

301
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:52,882
Do you have a plan tonight?

302
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:55,009
Actually, you shouldn't have a plan.

303
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:57,386
We're having dinner together
with both families.

304
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:03,851
Why? Is it too hard for you?

305
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:07,188
No, it's not.

306
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:09,523
I made you a promise.

307
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:12,526
I promised to cooperate with you
on things that need to be done.

308
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:14,153
I'll cooperate.

309
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,239
Is there anything else I need to do?

310
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,076
Tell me. I'll do it.

311
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,496
No.

312
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:24,747
I'll see you

313
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,667
at the restaurant in this hotel at seven.

314
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,799
<i>I don't trust you.</i>

315
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:36,926
I understand, sir.

316
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,844
If I weren't you, I wouldn't trust me.

317
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:40,680
<i>So where's Se-ri?</i>

318
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:43,599
I can't tell you that so soon.

319
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,477
I need my weapon for negotiation.

320
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,230
<i>Do you want to vanish</i>
<i>off the face of the earth there?</i>

321
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:52,066
If I vanish off the face
of the earth here,

322
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:55,486
you will never be able
to find out your money.

323
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,154
Are you okay with that?

324
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:02,618
So what do you want?

325
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,412
<i>Let's agree on half and half.</i>

326
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:07,456
-What?
-<i>I'll give the half back to you.</i>

327
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,417
You should fill in the rest
with your own money.

328
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,335
You have a lot of money.

329
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:12,962
You damn bastard.

330
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:15,339
It's your only younger sister
I'm talking about.

331
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:20,052
I know the whereabouts of your sister
who's known to be dead.

332
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,265
I believe it's worth the money.

333
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:34,900
Watch him closely here.

334
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,610
We never know what he's up to.

335
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:37,611
Yes, sir.

336
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:03,304
Excuse me.

337
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,682
If you're trying to jump off,

338
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:10,686
the building over there
is higher than this hotel.

339
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,021
You should go there.

340
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,196
Don't you know me?

341
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:23,532
I guess you do.

342
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:24,992
Don't you worry.

343
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:28,370
We'll make sure you get there
safe and sound.

344
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:30,581
Thank you.

345
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:35,920
Do you remember me now?
It's good to see you again.

346
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,174
I've had enough of this.

347
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:43,719
Actually, I'm from the UK.

348
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:46,722
I'm here for business.

349
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,267
That's why I sound like this.
So you don't have to call the cop.

350
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:52,353
I'm not interested in your way of talking.

351
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:55,564
Then I guess a guy you're interested in
is troubling you.

352
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:59,527
The rooftop is a place
for times like that.

353
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:04,031
My fiancé got caught in a hotel
with another woman.

354
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:07,076
My gosh. That's a tough one.

355
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:09,203
So did you catch him on the spot?

356
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:10,871
I don't know.

357
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:14,166
Don't be so upset because of that man.

358
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:16,919
If you do,

359
00:22:17,378 --> 00:22:18,671
the guy will grow away from you.

360
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:19,672
Do you know why?

361
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:23,384
A man wouldn't want to stay
with someone who's troubled by him.

362
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:25,845
What do I do then?

363
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:28,889
Just ignore him.

364
00:22:28,973 --> 00:22:31,600
If you ignore him now,
you won't be ignored later.

365
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:35,938
When it comes to a romantic relationship,
your initial position lasts forever.

366
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:41,986
What were you doing on the rooftop
when you are so smart?

367
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,112
Me?

368
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,867
I'm just troubled with money matters.

369
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:50,619
Actually, I'm in love with money.

370
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:54,874
I thought it was about to come to me,
but it hasn't come yet.

371
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,376
It just hurt me like this.

372
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:03,257
When it comes to money,
your initial position also matters.

373
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:06,051
-Like how?
-Money comes only when you ignore it

374
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:07,094
and look down on it.

375
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:09,889
If you cling to it and follow it around,

376
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:13,350
it will just run away from you
waiting for you to catch it.

377
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:16,520
I guess we can learn from each other.

378
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,859
Please forgive my indecent looks.

379
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:25,112
My name is Gu Seung-jun.

380
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,454
I'm Seo Dan.

381
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,296
You look fine though.

382
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:44,131
Why would I not be fine?

383
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:46,300
I thought you'd get shot.

384
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:48,928
She was shooting
the laser beam from her eyes.

385
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:53,807
Are you sure you'll be okay by yourself?

386
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:58,812
I'll be fine. He's someone I already know.

387
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:00,689
I can't say he's a really good man,

388
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:02,608
but he's not that bad.

389
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:05,903
You should get rid of pincers
even when you eat a cooked crab.

390
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:08,280
What about a cooked crab?

391
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:13,452
A clumsy person like you
should be careful of everything.

392
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:16,872
Someone you trust is the first one
to stab you in the back.

393
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:19,917
That's dangerous.

394
00:24:20,918 --> 00:24:22,670
-What?
-Your eyes.

395
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,047
Those I'm-in-love-and-I'm-worried eyes.

396
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:27,257
What eyes?

397
00:24:27,341 --> 00:24:29,009
Don't fall for me, Jeong Hyeok.

398
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:30,636
It'll only make things weird.

399
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,723
You're not running a fever.

400
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:36,934
Stop touching me.

401
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,727
Don't have a crush on me.

402
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:40,688
I can't do anything for you.

403
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:43,524
I don't understand
why she keeps talking nonsense.

404
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:49,113
Hi, Se-ri.

405
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:51,615
Hey, Seung-jun.

406
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:54,827
He seems quite handsome from here.

407
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:58,038
Does it have different meanings
in South Korea?

408
00:24:58,122 --> 00:25:00,374
You should go then. I'll see you later.

409
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:02,835
I was going to, just now...

410
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:05,212
You're here right on time.

411
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:08,298
Bye, Mr. Ri.

412
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,223
Gosh, Mom.

413
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:17,933
What's wrong with your face?

414
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:21,812
Why are you behind in fashion
when you're young?

415
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:24,982
This is the contouring makeup
which is popular these days.

416
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:27,526
Look how prominent my nose looks.

417
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:30,362
And my jawline seems very sharp.

418
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:31,947
It's not sharp at all.

419
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:33,657
You just look scary.

420
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:34,867
That's right.

421
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:38,370
I actually wanted to
look scary with this contour.

422
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:39,371
Why?

423
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:43,000
I won't let the Ri family
gloss over things anymore.

424
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,002
I will have it out with them tonight.

425
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:46,879
They're mistreating you
because I'm a widow.

426
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,380
Mom.

427
00:25:48,756 --> 00:25:51,300
I know he's the Director
of the General Political Bureau,

428
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:54,887
but I sweep all the dollars in Pyongyang.

429
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,431
They promised to marry their son
to you for money,

430
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:59,600
but it has dragged on for years.

431
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:07,524
Excuse me.

432
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:09,610
Here.

433
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:11,070
Yes, sir.

434
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:18,452
Dan.

435
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:19,620
Yes.

436
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:24,875
So you run a business here?

437
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:27,294
To be exact, I'm doing
some market research.

438
00:26:27,878 --> 00:26:29,797
-For what?
-You know Jim Rogers.

439
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:33,801
He's one of the top three investors
in the world. He's a close friend of mine.

440
00:26:33,884 --> 00:26:35,761
Don't tell no porky.

441
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:41,058
Anyway, he told me this.

442
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:44,311
He wants to invest all his money
in North Korea, if it's possible.

443
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:47,981
Why? The farmland here
is seriously undervalued.

444
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:51,235
It's like the last blue ocean
left in the world.

445
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:54,822
So I'm doing some research
and groundwork behind the scenes

446
00:26:54,905 --> 00:26:56,281
in order to grab a chance on time.

447
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:57,324
So

448
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,409
you're here to look at some land?

449
00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:02,830
Yes. And the coal mines
I bought in Ireland

450
00:27:02,913 --> 00:27:05,749
are showing low profits these days.

451
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:07,126
Prices are too high there.

452
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:12,506
So I looked around the Aoji Coal Mine.

453
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:14,383
Stop talking about Aoji.

454
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,468
What about the money
you conned my brother of?

455
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:17,803
It wasn't conning.

456
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:20,931
I guess you don't know
because you've been here for a while.

457
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:24,476
There was some misunderstanding
between us, and we cleared it up already.

458
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:26,895
You're lying.

459
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:29,606
Do you want to talk to him on the phone?

460
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,818
Oh, right. We can't
make a call to South Korea.

461
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:35,988
Anyway, I'm serious.

462
00:27:46,707 --> 00:27:49,418
I heard they met already.

463
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:51,086
Yes.

464
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:55,632
Since Jeong Hyeok
is very prudent and laid-back,

465
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:59,511
my daughter couldn't wait
and went down to see him.

466
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,762
Mom.

467
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:05,517
What's wrong? It's a compliment.

468
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:09,479
Being prudent and laid-back
is a good thing for a man.

469
00:28:11,148 --> 00:28:12,649
You are right.

470
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,613
By the way, Dan looks so pretty.

471
00:28:17,905 --> 00:28:19,072
She is, isn't she?

472
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:20,449
Yes.

473
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:23,660
She was even prettier yesterday.

474
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:28,957
Every day, day by day, She grows old.

475
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:33,503
The cells she had yesterday are gone now.

476
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:37,716
What she has now will be gone tomorrow.

477
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:39,718
Pardon?

478
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:46,099
These young and pretty man and woman
are withering away.

479
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:48,852
I think it's just

480
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:51,146
a great loss to the country.

481
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:53,357
I see.

482
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:56,860
I know we've been neglectful.

483
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:58,987
Think about it.

484
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:01,156
The wedding was put off

485
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,283
because of your son's accident.

486
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:05,869
Even mourning for your parent
would end in three years,

487
00:29:05,953 --> 00:29:08,205
-but it's been seven years already.
-Mom.

488
00:29:13,377 --> 00:29:15,170
Let's hold a wedding ceremony

489
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:17,839
on the last Saturday next month.

490
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:20,217
Pardon?

491
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:22,261
Well...

492
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:25,097
That would be nice.

493
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:28,892
I'll have Jeong Hyeok be transferred
to Pyongyang soon.

494
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:32,938
We will get them
a high-storied house there

495
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:35,607
and buy some household goods.

496
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:37,067
You don't have to prepare anything.

497
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,069
My gosh. But

498
00:29:39,987 --> 00:29:41,530
we can't do that.

499
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,782
We have to buy some basic furniture
and home appliances.

500
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:45,659
Basic furniture and appliances?

501
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:50,247
Ma'am, you don't seem
to know the latest fads.

502
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:53,375
The furniture is cabinet, bedding cabinet,
closet, bookshelf, and shoe shelf.

503
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,919
The home appliances are freezer,
washing machine,

504
00:29:56,003 --> 00:29:57,963
recorder, telephone, camera,
and electric fan.

505
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:00,590
I see.

506
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:05,178
There are also robotic vacuum cleaner,
speaking rice cooker,

507
00:30:05,262 --> 00:30:06,596
and goose down quilt.

508
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:10,100
We can prepare a lot more than that.

509
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:14,896
Jeong Hyeok, what do you think?
If it seems too hasty--

510
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,273
It's a long-standing promise.

511
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:17,774
We should keep it.

512
00:30:22,112 --> 00:30:25,407
We should pop the champagne tonight.

513
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:27,284
Waitress.

514
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:32,956
Get us the most expensive champagne here.

515
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:37,252
We have something to celebrate here.

516
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,254
Yes, ma'am.

517
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:54,644
I guess what you two are working on
is pretty urgent.

518
00:30:54,728 --> 00:30:56,730
You followed him all the way to Pyongyang.

519
00:30:57,647 --> 00:31:00,817
I didn't follow him.
We just came together.

520
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:05,322
You go to a hotel with one man
and have coffee with another.

521
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:07,449
I must say you are very sociable.

522
00:31:08,075 --> 00:31:10,327
Or are you just slutty?

523
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:16,958
Why?

524
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:20,379
I already had coffee with the guy
I came to a hotel with.

525
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:21,421
Earlier today.

526
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:23,715
Is that so?

527
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:29,721
I decided on a wedding date
with that man just a while ago.

528
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:33,850
We're getting married
on last Saturday next month.

529
00:31:38,188 --> 00:31:39,231
Is that so?

530
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:41,817
I see.

531
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:45,654
Congratulations. I wish I could
attend your wedding,

532
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:49,157
but I will be out of town by then.

533
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:50,283
Don't worry.

534
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:54,663
You leaving here
is the best wedding gift for me.

535
00:32:02,546 --> 00:32:05,006
Cursing someone with a smile is my thing.

536
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:07,008
But she just beat me to it.

537
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:09,344
Darn it.

538
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:13,807
Se-ri.

539
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:17,144
You've been pretty all your life,

540
00:32:17,227 --> 00:32:20,730
but why are you looking so tacky
right at this moment?

541
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:24,818
You should've chosen the Hello Style,

542
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:26,278
not the Goodbye Style.

543
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:28,196
Did you get the picture?

544
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:30,824
See? I was right about that.

545
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:35,579
No. She's not someone who looks like her.
It's just her.

546
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:39,749
<i>Where would I find a woman</i>
<i>who resembles Se-ri?</i>

547
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:41,835
Hang on. Don't hang up.

548
00:32:45,881 --> 00:32:48,758
Shall we go out and walk?

549
00:32:51,011 --> 00:32:52,721
Even in Pyongyang,

550
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:55,432
things turn pretty with autumn leaves.

551
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:57,601
It's just like Seoul.

552
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:01,271
Right.

553
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:03,106
I'm done talking.

554
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:04,816
Let's talk about you now.

555
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:08,445
What about me?

556
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:11,031
How did you get here?

557
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,826
There was an accident.

558
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:17,037
What accident?

559
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,457
I can't tell you now.

560
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:22,918
I'll tell you the details later.

561
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:24,669
One thing I can tell you

562
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:27,506
is that I'll go back to Seoul soon.

563
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:31,343
<i>Since you're here on business,</i>
<i>I guess you'll go back soon.</i>

564
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:33,762
I will.

565
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:34,971
Then...

566
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:38,642
Can I ask you a favor?

567
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:44,648
Tell my father that I'm still alive.

568
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:46,816
And...

569
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:50,278
tell him to go ahead as planned.

570
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:53,782
<i>You have to tell him that</i>
<i>before the shareholder meeting.</i>

571
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:58,203
Okay.

572
00:33:58,828 --> 00:33:59,955
I'll tell him.

573
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:01,164
Don't worry.

574
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:02,624
Thank you.

575
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:24,312
My goodness.

576
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:25,939
What did you do on your face?

577
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:30,610
Hey, you should know that this face
made Dan fix her wedding date.

578
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:40,996
I guess there's nothing she can't do
with that face.

579
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:43,873
I'm happy for you Dan.
You're getting married.

580
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:48,211
Is it a good thing only for me?

581
00:34:48,295 --> 00:34:52,173
Of course not. Your mom must be happy too.

582
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:55,427
So you and your mom has finally
realized your wishes.

583
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:57,429
Jeong Hyeok,

584
00:34:57,721 --> 00:34:59,306
I'll give you a call.

585
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:06,187
What's wrong with her?

586
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:08,231
Jeong Hyeok, I should get going.

587
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:18,992
Oh, right. Jeong Hyeok.
About the thing you asked me before.

588
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:10,335
MY COUNTRY
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH

589
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:50,083
Excuse me, Comrade.

590
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:52,293
Why is your skirt so short?

591
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:55,296
-What's going on?
-And your hair is too long.

592
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,507
It's like the 1970s.

593
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,926
They crack down
on people's dress and hairstyles?

594
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:01,886
I can't believe this.

595
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:07,851
Why aren't you two wearing the portrait?

596
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:10,061
Do you not speak Korean?

597
00:37:13,106 --> 00:37:16,526
I asked why you two aren't
wearing the portrait.

598
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:34,335
You may go.

599
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:38,715
What is he talking about?

600
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:40,383
What?

601
00:37:43,136 --> 00:37:45,722
People from both North and South
are afraid to speak English.

602
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:53,688
Jeong Hyeok.

603
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:56,858
Did he not get off work yet?

604
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,067
What are you doing here?

605
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:00,779
I'm the one to ask the question. Let's go.

606
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:05,033
Seung-jun, I should go with him.

607
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:08,620
If you have anything to tell me urgently,
call the number I gave you.

608
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:10,079
Okay. I'll see you around.

609
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:13,583
Keep up the good work, Mr. Ri.

610
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:23,092
"The number I gave you?"
What number did you give him?

611
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:26,179
I gave him your mobile number.

612
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:29,682
My mobile number?
Who said you can do that?

613
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:33,937
Seung-jun promised
to tell my father about me.

614
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:37,357
But why do you seem so upset?

615
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,484
You said I'm your bodyguard
who needs to protect you.

616
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:41,736
I can't protect you when I can't see you.

617
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,489
Is that why you're upset?

618
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:46,199
Because you couldn't see me?

619
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:50,620
So you should stay in my sight.

620
00:38:53,206 --> 00:38:54,123
What if I stay

621
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:56,125
within your sight?

622
00:38:57,252 --> 00:38:58,461
Then you'll be safe.

623
00:38:59,629 --> 00:39:01,214
As long as you stay in my sight.

624
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:20,567
You're not in the Avengers or anything.

625
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:24,320
How can you be so sure of yourself
when you don't know what lies ahead?

626
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,073
Do you think you can win all the time?

627
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:30,118
There aren't that many memories
of defeat in my life.

628
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,042
Well, now that I'm here,

629
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:40,461
even if I don't get to try
Pyongyang <i>naengmyeon,</i>

630
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:43,172
I would like to try beer
along the Taedong River.

631
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:44,549
Do you know a place?

632
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:54,809
-Here you go.
-Stop that!

633
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:56,185
-Don't worry.
-That's okay.

634
00:39:56,269 --> 00:39:58,563
You should try this, too. This is good.

635
00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:00,315
This is the one.

636
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:04,360
I can't remember the last time
I had fried chicken and beer.

637
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:07,071
To tell you the truth,
the only thing I really craved

638
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:11,075
was the crispy fried chicken and beer
I had from time to time in Seoul.

639
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:15,330
Their fried chicken is pretty good, too.

640
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:16,372
Order it.

641
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:20,919
I want the number one draft beer

642
00:40:21,002 --> 00:40:23,171
which is the most expensive beer
on the list

643
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:26,758
and sweet fried chicken.

644
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:29,552
We'd like two 500ml glasses
of beer number 1 and sweet fried chicken.

645
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:30,845
Okay.

646
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:46,027
No one is chasing you.

647
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:55,745
I've been really stressed out lately.

648
00:40:56,496 --> 00:40:58,206
Let's drink a lot today.

649
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:01,668
It's not like you stopped drinking.

650
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:05,838
But drinking today feels a bit different.

651
00:41:05,922 --> 00:41:07,799
I took my photo for my passport.

652
00:41:08,758 --> 00:41:10,176
And I'll be leaving soon.

653
00:41:21,062 --> 00:41:22,397
What's happening right now?

654
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:24,023
It's a blackout.

655
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:27,860
I didn't know there were blackouts
in Pyongyang.

656
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:29,779
The power will be back soon.

657
00:41:30,363 --> 00:41:32,323
People here aren't even surprised.

658
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:04,689
It's snowing.

659
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,191
I'm watching, too.

660
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:09,277
Isn't this the first snow?

661
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:15,491
Goodness, we're in trouble.
This isn't good.

662
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:20,663
If you watch the first snow with someone,
your love will be fulfilled.

663
00:42:20,747 --> 00:42:21,998
Have you not heard of this myth?

664
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,918
It's my first time hearing it.

665
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:31,758
In Seoul,
the communication network crashes

666
00:42:31,841 --> 00:42:34,260
when it's the first snowfall
of the season. It's crazy.

667
00:42:34,469 --> 00:42:36,721
They're all trying to set up a date
with their crushes.

668
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:37,847
Why?

669
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:40,516
If they watch the first snow together,
their love comes true.

670
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,352
Really?

671
00:42:43,436 --> 00:42:44,520
Yes.

672
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:47,231
But

673
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:50,026
it's not supposed to work between us.

674
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:51,527
It'd be a mess.

675
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:55,323
Yes. That's a big mess.

676
00:42:58,659 --> 00:42:59,869
A big mess?

677
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:02,997
Why?

678
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:06,250
What? Because you're with me
when you should have been

679
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:07,335
with your real fiancée?

680
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:10,338
Is that why it's a big mess?

681
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:13,299
I'm sorry,

682
00:43:13,883 --> 00:43:15,802
but do you have a disorder?

683
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:19,806
Like a happiness-sad disorder?

684
00:43:19,889 --> 00:43:21,557
What's "happiness-sad disorder"?

685
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:24,602
Wait, are you talking
about bipolar disorder?

686
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:27,480
You keep changing your stances.

687
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:29,857
I don't know what you really want.

688
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:32,276
I don't even understand myself.

689
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:34,570
How could you understand me?

690
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:40,368
And this repeating cycle of my mood swings

691
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:42,370
is my drinking habit.

692
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:43,663
Let's just

693
00:43:44,247 --> 00:43:45,414
bump it.

694
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:15,695
Is my head heavy?

695
00:44:17,405 --> 00:44:18,531
A bit.

696
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:19,824
Hold on.

697
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:24,704
If this small face of mine
is heavy for you,

698
00:44:25,288 --> 00:44:27,206
your shoulder...

699
00:44:27,707 --> 00:44:30,084
Why do you bother carrying
around your broad shoulder?

700
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:33,004
You should get rid of your muscles here.

701
00:44:37,425 --> 00:44:39,260
Just put up with me a bit longer.

702
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:43,389
My head is heavy

703
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:49,145
because I have a lot on my mind.

704
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:52,273
Why do you have a lot on your mind?

705
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,649
You'll be going back soon.

706
00:44:55,443 --> 00:44:57,069
Shouldn't you be liking it?

707
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:03,576
I am liking it.

708
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:09,874
It's the liking part

709
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:12,627
that's giving me a headache.

710
00:45:14,045 --> 00:45:15,379
Because I like it.

711
00:45:23,596 --> 00:45:25,681
You don't know anything.

712
00:46:09,225 --> 00:46:11,018
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

713
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:27,410
Here's the fried chicken you ordered.

714
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:28,911
-Enjoy it.
-Thank you.

715
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:31,122
Hey, that was a big lead.

716
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:34,250
We really got a big lead.
The police will analyze the recording

717
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:35,376
and track the location.

718
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:37,086
I'm sure they'll find her.

719
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:40,756
You also sent them
a copy of the recording, right?

720
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,633
Her brother and her sister-in-law.

721
00:46:42,717 --> 00:46:44,510
Yes, I gave it to his secretary.

722
00:46:45,094 --> 00:46:48,264
They are going to believe us, right?

723
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:50,850
Hey, let's drink.

724
00:46:51,434 --> 00:46:53,978
Let's drink to the swift and safe return
of our boss, Se-ri one.

725
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:55,688
-Cheers.
-Wait.

726
00:46:56,689 --> 00:46:57,690
Hold on.

727
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:00,568
Yes, I want her to return safely,

728
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,653
but does she have to return quickly?

729
00:47:03,279 --> 00:47:05,072
-What?
-Buddy, hear me out.

730
00:47:05,156 --> 00:47:07,700
Here's a major premise of mine.

731
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:10,369
I am so happy that she's alive.

732
00:47:10,453 --> 00:47:11,537
I'm over the moon about it.

733
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:13,414
I feel relieved
now that I know she's alive.

734
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:16,167
It makes me want to go to church
this weekend. I'm serious. I mean it.

735
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:17,668
But what?

736
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:21,630
But when I thought
about how she will be coming back,

737
00:47:22,131 --> 00:47:24,717
it is true that I did think for a second
that she can take her time.

738
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,346
It's just that
I deserve a break like this.

739
00:47:29,347 --> 00:47:32,099
Lately, my evenings became very relaxing.

740
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:34,226
Hey, she's from a rich family.

741
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:36,729
Do you think her family would do nothing

742
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:38,522
after hearing her desperate voice?

743
00:47:40,024 --> 00:47:41,942
YOON JEUNG-PYEONG

744
00:47:43,903 --> 00:47:45,905
Explain to me how my sister Se-ri

745
00:47:46,322 --> 00:47:47,823
ended up there.

746
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:50,076
What? Right.

747
00:47:50,618 --> 00:47:52,953
I also thought it was preposterous
when I heard about it.

748
00:47:53,621 --> 00:47:56,290
Gosh, I don't know
why she went there, either.

749
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:58,667
Manager Oh, do a job for me.

750
00:47:58,751 --> 00:48:00,086
Yes, sir.

751
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:02,171
Please make sure she--

752
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:04,090
Of course.
We'll get her out of there safely.

753
00:48:04,173 --> 00:48:06,926
We are the experts in that field.

754
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:10,346
We will do our best,
so she can return home safely.

755
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:11,639
-I'm going to--
-No.

756
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:13,349
-No.
-Pardon?

757
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:15,851
Just make sure she stays there.

758
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:20,189
You don't want us to get her out of there?

759
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:22,191
-No.
-No, that's not what you want.

760
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:24,193
Make sure she stays there forever.

761
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:25,611
Do you not understand it?

762
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:31,367
-Was it Manager Oh?
-Yes.

763
00:48:31,951 --> 00:48:34,328
We'll send someone to your home tomorrow.

764
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:37,706
Get your ID and a copy
of your bank account ready.

765
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:40,084
As soon as you sign the agreement,

766
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:41,544
the money will be wired to you.

767
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:43,129
Excuse me?

768
00:48:43,212 --> 00:48:44,422
Listen carefully.

769
00:48:45,131 --> 00:48:46,424
It's simple.

770
00:48:46,507 --> 00:48:49,343
We want Se-ri to continue

771
00:48:50,136 --> 00:48:51,720
to stay there.

772
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:56,642
In other words,
she must never come back here.

773
00:48:57,601 --> 00:49:00,187
Just make that happen. If you do,

774
00:49:01,397 --> 00:49:03,816
you won't have to worry about money
for the rest of your life.

775
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:09,989
<i>Just stop her</i>
<i>from returning to South Korea.</i>

776
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:13,784
And take whatever means necessary.
That's it.

777
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:15,744
If you do that,

778
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:20,040
he said he would forget
about the money you scammed from him.

779
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:21,709
It's a win-win.

780
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:23,752
What a nice family.

781
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:25,754
How could they be so heartless?

782
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:29,758
We just need to focus on the gains
we'll get from this deal.

783
00:49:29,842 --> 00:49:31,635
That's true.

784
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:36,390
Then, we need to meet up
with that guy first.

785
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:41,437
The most powerful governmental officer
in this field, Cho Cheol Gang.

786
00:49:41,854 --> 00:49:43,397
Where is he now?

787
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:46,859
PYONGYANG INSPECTION DEPARTMENT

788
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:58,871
Goodness, look at that.

789
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:02,791
I've never seen anyone finish his food
after coming here.

790
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:07,129
You know what? You have guts.

791
00:50:13,594 --> 00:50:14,970
There's a saying,

792
00:50:15,054 --> 00:50:17,473
"Tears fall down, but the spoon goes up."

793
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:19,600
We're working hard here
to put food in our mouth.

794
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:22,269
There's not a thing that will stop me
from finishing my meal.

795
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:26,023
Goodness, I don't think you have grasped
the gravity of the situation.

796
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:28,108
You're in a serious predicament.

797
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:31,362
I checked your call history.

798
00:50:32,071 --> 00:50:34,114
You often talked to the Engineer Brigade

799
00:50:34,198 --> 00:50:36,617
that's strongly suspected
to have been involved.

800
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:37,743
Is that so?

801
00:50:38,786 --> 00:50:41,705
Well, there must have been a reason
for my calling.

802
00:50:42,373 --> 00:50:44,083
Does that count as evidence?

803
00:50:45,084 --> 00:50:46,168
Evidence?

804
00:50:47,336 --> 00:50:48,921
You son of a bitch.

805
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:52,633
Did you think I would go easy on you
because you're one of us?

806
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:54,385
Four people died.

807
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:57,012
Among those three were grave robbers

808
00:50:57,096 --> 00:50:58,847
whom you gave orders to steal.

809
00:50:58,931 --> 00:51:01,559
Didn't you mobilize the trucks
from the Engineer Brigade

810
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:04,019
and kill them to keep them silent?

811
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:07,523
Director Hwang Tae Yong
of the Inspection Department.

812
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:09,275
How do you know

813
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:11,318
my name?

814
00:51:11,402 --> 00:51:14,071
You may not know it,
but we are closer than you think.

815
00:51:14,655 --> 00:51:15,698
What?

816
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:19,910
What do you mean?
I've never met you before.

817
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:24,873
Why don't we continue this
without the investigators here?

818
00:51:26,584 --> 00:51:28,919
Don't get smart with me.
Or you'll end up with broken bones.

819
00:51:29,003 --> 00:51:30,921
Just answer my question!

820
00:51:31,255 --> 00:51:33,257
Well, if that's what you want.

821
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:35,759
Director Hwang.

822
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:38,387
Before you joined
the Inspection Department,

823
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:40,681
your daughter got married, didn't she?

824
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:42,808
Didn't she get a unit
in a newly built apartment

825
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:44,810
near the Potong River
for her marital home?

826
00:51:45,394 --> 00:51:48,355
The 30-story apartment
that costs about 100,000 dollars?

827
00:51:56,572 --> 00:51:57,740
Who are you?

828
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:01,702
-How do you know that?
-To help you buy

829
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:05,331
your daughter's marital home,
I sold off dozens of my antiques.

830
00:52:05,414 --> 00:52:07,249
If you're curious, just tell me.

831
00:52:07,583 --> 00:52:10,502
I recorded the dates and time.
And I also have

832
00:52:10,586 --> 00:52:12,004
photos for evidence.

833
00:52:13,172 --> 00:52:15,007
You aren't the only one.

834
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:18,344
Director of the Investigation Department,
Director of the State Security Department,

835
00:52:18,427 --> 00:52:21,221
and the higher-ups.

836
00:52:22,765 --> 00:52:25,392
There's only a handful of people
who didn't take money from me.

837
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:28,896
It doesn't take a lot to be a family.

838
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:32,149
Once you share, you become a family.

839
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:34,151
Let me live, too.

840
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:35,986
We're family.

841
00:52:49,083 --> 00:52:50,876
What did you tell them?

842
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:52,294
Why did they release you?

843
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:55,673
From what I know,
it's hard to get out of there alive.

844
00:52:55,756 --> 00:53:01,345
In life, there is no such thing
as a free lunch.

845
00:53:01,929 --> 00:53:04,807
That's why a free lunch
is the most expensive.

846
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:08,227
Cheol Gang, I asked you a question.
You ought to answer it.

847
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:11,021
Why are you deflecting the question?
How rude of you.

848
00:53:11,105 --> 00:53:14,358
Are you telling me I ought to help you out
because I took money from you?

849
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:16,235
Sir.

850
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:20,656
I, Cho Cheol Gang, was an orphan,
roaming around and begging for food.

851
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:24,201
I neither have parents nor siblings.

852
00:53:24,785 --> 00:53:27,663
You're the one who helped me
get to where I am now.

853
00:53:29,373 --> 00:53:30,541
You're my family.

854
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:34,002
Is that so?

855
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:37,005
I will be loyal to you.

856
00:53:37,965 --> 00:53:39,341
No matter what happens,

857
00:53:39,675 --> 00:53:43,303
a family is supposed
to stick together to the end.

858
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:49,768
He meant we're in the same boat.

859
00:53:49,852 --> 00:53:52,312
Why did he make it sound so scary, then?

860
00:53:53,689 --> 00:53:55,524
Is he the grim reaper or what?

861
00:53:58,110 --> 00:54:01,280
It seems a lot of things happened
when I was away.

862
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:03,657
Yes, a lot has happened.

863
00:54:04,867 --> 00:54:06,118
Which brings me to say--

864
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:08,954
Do you intend to keep
one more person other than me?

865
00:54:09,037 --> 00:54:10,122
One more?

866
00:54:19,715 --> 00:54:21,216
Do you know this person?

867
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:22,468
What about you?

868
00:54:23,635 --> 00:54:26,013
-Do you know her?
-You answer me first.

869
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:27,139
Who is this woman?

870
00:54:28,307 --> 00:54:29,308
<i>Sam Suk.</i>

871
00:54:30,142 --> 00:54:33,437
Wait, Comrade Ri is here.
Why are you leaving without him?

872
00:54:34,146 --> 00:54:36,565
Is it because of that woman?
That White Fox?

873
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:38,692
-You mean that bitch?
-That gigabytch?

874
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:42,780
Yes. That's right.
It's because of that ass-hat.

875
00:54:44,198 --> 00:54:45,949
I have no choice, you know.

876
00:54:46,033 --> 00:54:49,286
Gosh, she must have been crushed
in Pyongyang.

877
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:52,581
What happened?
Did she pull your hair or something?

878
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:55,125
My gosh. Do people also pull hair here?

879
00:54:55,209 --> 00:54:57,711
When you fight, you pull their hair.
What else can you do?

880
00:54:57,795 --> 00:54:59,087
-Right.
-Do you not do that there?

881
00:54:59,171 --> 00:55:00,839
-You ought to.
-You need to pull her hair.

882
00:55:00,923 --> 00:55:02,132
-Exactly.
-Right.

883
00:55:02,216 --> 00:55:05,052
It is true.
We are indeed of the same ethnicity.

884
00:55:05,636 --> 00:55:07,095
But I didn't pull out her hair.

885
00:55:07,179 --> 00:55:09,348
And she didn't pull out my hair, either.

886
00:55:09,473 --> 00:55:10,307
I just

887
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:13,602
don't want him to be in pain anymore.

888
00:55:14,186 --> 00:55:16,897
Goodness, but still.

889
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:19,608
Are you telling me
that you will part your ways with him

890
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:20,984
just like Gyeonu and Jiknyeo did?

891
00:55:21,068 --> 00:55:23,403
We don't have to live together
to be in love.

892
00:55:24,905 --> 00:55:27,199
The singer, Choe Sam Suk,
sang about this, too.

893
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:30,494
Love is engraved in our hearts.

894
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:32,830
True love

895
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:36,667
ought to be engraved in your heart.

896
00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:39,711
Sam Suk.

897
00:55:41,213 --> 00:55:44,883
Don't engrave your love in your heart.

898
00:55:44,967 --> 00:55:46,218
Do it in your brain.

899
00:55:46,468 --> 00:55:47,803
If you engrave it here,

900
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:50,514
you can't live as it's too painful.

901
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:55,853
Well, you are bound to forget some things
as time passes by.

902
00:55:56,937 --> 00:55:59,231
Live a better life, so he sees it.

903
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:01,817
Meet someone
who's more distinguished than he is.

904
00:56:03,402 --> 00:56:05,237
This is so sad.

905
00:56:06,113 --> 00:56:07,906
Make sure you stay healthy.

906
00:56:08,532 --> 00:56:10,492
I wonder if we'll ever meet again.

907
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:14,204
Come over here.

908
00:56:16,874 --> 00:56:18,041
It all worked out.

909
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:20,252
I'm sure you two
would have broken up later.

910
00:56:20,836 --> 00:56:23,130
Then, breaking up now
is 100 times better than later.

911
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:25,132
You made the right decision. Good.

912
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:26,049
Wait.

913
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:28,093
How could you be so sure

914
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:30,220
that we would have broken up?

915
00:56:30,429 --> 00:56:32,264
He and I could have lived
a good life together.

916
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:35,058
No. There's no way.

917
00:56:35,142 --> 00:56:36,727
That cannot be the case.

918
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:38,770
Why not?

919
00:56:39,897 --> 00:56:42,441
First, your personalities don't match.

920
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:46,778
And you're not exactly the type of woman
the elders like.

921
00:56:46,987 --> 00:56:50,532
So you must have had a terrible
relationship with your mother-in-law.

922
00:56:50,908 --> 00:56:53,327
This is much better
than getting a divorce later.

923
00:56:53,869 --> 00:56:55,746
You must have misjudged me.

924
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:58,290
I smile to the elders

925
00:56:58,373 --> 00:57:01,043
and talk to them in a very gentle manner.

926
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:03,462
Sam Suk, did you know?

927
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:06,715
You are smiling with your eyes,

928
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:09,635
but you're talking back to me.

929
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:13,055
When you do that,
I want to bash your head in.

930
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:16,266
-Others wouldn't have put up with that.
-You shouldn't have put up with me, then.

931
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:18,185
See? Did you see that?

932
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:20,228
When an older person points out your flaw,

933
00:57:20,312 --> 00:57:22,314
you ought to accept it.

934
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:25,984
You never accept it
or try to fix your flaw.

935
00:57:26,068 --> 00:57:27,694
When I talk to you,

936
00:57:27,778 --> 00:57:30,113
my blood pressure rises.

937
00:57:30,197 --> 00:57:31,073
It's the same with me.

938
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:33,408
Let's put an end to this
for the sake of our blood vessels.

939
00:57:33,492 --> 00:57:34,910
Let's do that. Bye.

940
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:36,536
Take care. I'm leaving.

941
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:38,288
Fine. I'm leaving, too.

942
00:57:38,372 --> 00:57:39,498
Goodness.

943
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:40,958
-Move.
-Move out of my way.

944
00:57:41,041 --> 00:57:42,793
Those are my shoes.

945
00:57:47,506 --> 00:57:49,132
Do you know who that is?

946
00:57:50,926 --> 00:57:53,762
Right. You've only listening
to her voice all this time.

947
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:55,806
You probably don't know how she looks.

948
00:57:56,682 --> 00:58:00,143
She's that woman who's staying
at Ri Jeong Hyeok's house.

949
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:05,941
Today, I received a request
to keep her here.

950
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:07,359
Pardon?

951
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:09,069
Do you know this person?

952
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:11,780
What about you? Do you know her?

953
00:58:11,863 --> 00:58:13,156
You answer me first.

954
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:14,616
Who is this woman?

955
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,036
She's my friend.

956
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:22,249
What was her status in South Korea?

957
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:25,585
Well, she's from a rich family
and lived a comfortable life.

958
00:58:25,669 --> 00:58:27,045
That's all you need to know.

959
00:58:27,129 --> 00:58:28,797
Now, you answer my question.

960
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,257
How do you know her?

961
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:38,390
She's staying
in the military housing area now.

962
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:39,474
I know that.

963
00:58:39,558 --> 00:58:42,769
Do you also know
that she's leaving here this Thursday?

964
00:58:43,687 --> 00:58:45,439
-She's leaving?
-I heard that

965
00:58:45,564 --> 00:58:47,315
she's ready to leave via plane.

966
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:48,775
That can't happen.

967
00:58:50,027 --> 00:58:51,111
You must stop that first.

968
00:58:51,737 --> 00:58:54,698
He asked me to stop her from leaving.
It's killing two birds with one stone.

969
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:58,076
I can get rid of what's been bothering me
and make money, too.

970
00:59:00,162 --> 00:59:01,580
What do you plan to do?

971
00:59:02,164 --> 00:59:05,083
Thanks to you,
I have all the information I need.

972
00:59:05,167 --> 00:59:09,087
I know which flight
the national team will be taking.

973
00:59:09,171 --> 00:59:11,214
And there is only one route to

974
00:59:12,174 --> 00:59:13,675
Pyongyang Sunan International Airport.

975
00:59:28,023 --> 00:59:29,608
I'm sure you all heard.

976
00:59:30,025 --> 00:59:32,986
This time, I'll be really going back home.

977
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:34,529
Whatever.

978
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:36,573
Will you give us a present again?

979
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:38,158
Do you think I'm Santa Claus?

980
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:40,827
I don't even have 100 won.
I can't give you presents again.

981
00:59:40,911 --> 00:59:42,287
There's nothing I can give you.

982
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:43,413
"Santa Claus"?

983
00:59:43,955 --> 00:59:45,415
What's that?

984
00:59:51,338 --> 00:59:53,632
As for Santa Claus,

985
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:57,010
he's an old man who goes down
people's chimneys once a year--

986
00:59:57,094 --> 00:59:58,220
Is he a thief?

987
00:59:58,804 --> 01:00:02,349
No. You can't call him a thief
because he leaves presents.

988
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:04,226
I see. Does that mean
he's a righteous thief?

989
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:07,771
All right. Stop talking about
whether or not he's a righteous thief.

990
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:11,900
Anyway, I'll be going back
for real this time.

991
01:00:11,983 --> 01:00:14,903
To celebrate our farewell
in a beautiful way,

992
01:00:14,986 --> 01:00:18,031
an idea of going on a picnic together
was suggested.

993
01:00:18,115 --> 01:00:20,117
Who was it? Who suggested such an idea?

994
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:21,618
I did.

995
01:00:24,371 --> 01:00:26,957
Captain Ri,
why don't you put her in her place?

996
01:00:27,207 --> 01:00:28,625
She keeps talking nonsense

997
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:30,961
and has these pipe dreams
because you let her have her way.

998
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:34,172
We'll have a day off in two days.
Shall we go, then?

999
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:36,925
I'll have outing permits
ready for the four of you.

1000
01:00:40,512 --> 01:00:42,639
I need to clean the badge on my cap,

1001
01:00:42,722 --> 01:00:44,516
clean the gold buttons,

1002
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:46,643
wash the collar and iron it on my day off.

1003
01:00:46,726 --> 01:00:47,978
There's a lot that must be done.

1004
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:50,355
I can't afford
to lounge around on a picnic.

1005
01:00:51,189 --> 01:00:53,108
I'm against this idea.

1006
01:00:59,614 --> 01:01:01,533
RICE

1007
01:01:01,616 --> 01:01:04,119
By the way, we're going on a picnic.

1008
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:06,246
Why did you bring shovels and axes?

1009
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:09,040
Are you really trying
to bury me somewhere?

1010
01:01:09,124 --> 01:01:10,667
I will regret sending you back

1011
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:12,544
in one piece instead of burying you here

1012
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:13,837
for the rest of my life.

1013
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,925
I don't see your captain and Eun Dong.

1014
01:01:19,009 --> 01:01:20,969
Eun Dong left before us
and started a fire.

1015
01:01:21,553 --> 01:01:22,929
And Captain Ri went somewhere.

1016
01:01:23,638 --> 01:01:26,183
-Where?
-I don't know that far.

1017
01:01:29,853 --> 01:01:32,189
Did he leave to prepare
for his wedding or something?

1018
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:43,992
This is not the picnic I had in mind.

1019
01:01:44,910 --> 01:01:46,203
But this is nice, too.

1020
01:01:46,953 --> 01:01:48,455
This is romantic.

1021
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:53,585
There's a piglet.

1022
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:56,796
All right. If you're ready,
slaughter the pig first.

1023
01:01:58,840 --> 01:01:59,758
Slaughter what?

1024
01:02:00,175 --> 01:02:03,178
We couldn't send you off
without a proper farewell present.

1025
01:02:03,261 --> 01:02:05,680
So we decided to see off
our prize pig today.

1026
01:02:05,764 --> 01:02:08,725
Why see him off? He doesn't belong
elsewhere, let's not do that.

1027
01:02:08,808 --> 01:02:10,560
When we met, we fired at you.

1028
01:02:10,977 --> 01:02:12,604
But we must bid farewell on a good note.

1029
01:02:12,687 --> 01:02:15,690
How could you say slaughtering the pig
is ending things on a good note?

1030
01:02:15,774 --> 01:02:20,195
Oh, right. We can't keep our food
refrigerated or frozen here.

1031
01:02:20,278 --> 01:02:22,364
When we go on a picnic, we bring a pig

1032
01:02:22,447 --> 01:02:24,616
and make pork roast on the spot.

1033
01:02:24,866 --> 01:02:26,326
No, I can't eat that.

1034
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:29,621
Our eyes met so many times.
There's no way I can eat that.

1035
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:32,749
When you first came here,
you told us that you had meat

1036
01:02:32,832 --> 01:02:34,167
for all three of your daily meals.

1037
01:02:34,251 --> 01:02:38,171
-Why are you acting all innocent now?
-Right. Yes, that was true back then.

1038
01:02:38,255 --> 01:02:40,423
I've never eaten an animal
I came face to face with.

1039
01:02:40,715 --> 01:02:42,050
No. I can't eat that one.

1040
01:02:42,676 --> 01:02:43,927
No.

1041
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:46,596
Then, what are we going to eat?

1042
01:02:53,895 --> 01:02:55,146
It's over there.

1043
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:56,773
Over there. Right there.

1044
01:02:56,856 --> 01:02:58,275
-There!
-Go now!

1045
01:02:58,358 --> 01:03:01,027
- Get it!
-That way!

1046
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:02,779
-Damn it.
-We missed it again!

1047
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:05,657
-You were supposed to be ready.
-I'll do it.

1048
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:06,783
Come on.

1049
01:03:07,409 --> 01:03:09,035
Hey, stop it. Don't do that!

1050
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:15,375
-Hey, we got it.
-Yes! We have a fish here!

1051
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:18,211
-We got a fish!
-Yes!

1052
01:03:19,963 --> 01:03:22,465
-Goodness.
-Hey.

1053
01:03:28,972 --> 01:03:31,599
-Did you do that?
-Yes, I really did that.

1054
01:03:34,561 --> 01:03:36,771
Here. I got it.

1055
01:03:37,314 --> 01:03:39,441
-Did you get it?
-It looks like he got two.

1056
01:03:40,775 --> 01:03:41,901
We got five.

1057
01:03:43,945 --> 01:03:45,238
Hey, be careful.

1058
01:03:53,621 --> 01:03:54,622
Here.

1059
01:03:55,165 --> 01:03:56,458
It's all ready.

1060
01:03:59,627 --> 01:04:01,379
-That looks good.
-I'll give you a lot.

1061
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:04,632
Isn't this good?

1062
01:04:05,133 --> 01:04:06,259
Yes.

1063
01:04:07,802 --> 01:04:10,180
-Is it good?
-This is so good.

1064
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:13,350
Where did you learn
to catch crabs like this?

1065
01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:16,019
I've never had tasty crabs like these.

1066
01:04:16,936 --> 01:04:19,064
I didn't know you could do that.

1067
01:04:19,147 --> 01:04:20,648
I caught all of these crabs.

1068
01:04:20,732 --> 01:04:21,983
This is so sweet.

1069
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:31,201
Since today is your last day here,

1070
01:04:31,284 --> 01:04:33,244
we have prepared a farewell ceremony.

1071
01:04:34,162 --> 01:04:35,246
Really?

1072
01:04:36,414 --> 01:04:38,625
It's about time. Where is it?

1073
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:39,751
What do you mean?

1074
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:41,336
What?

1075
01:04:41,461 --> 01:04:44,631
I thought you were giving me a present.
I gave you presents the first time around.

1076
01:04:45,215 --> 01:04:46,341
It's not a present.

1077
01:04:46,424 --> 01:04:49,010
Comrade Pyo wrote a farewell poem.

1078
01:04:49,094 --> 01:04:51,471
I'll pass. I don't need to hear--

1079
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:57,143
You're going to read the poem? Forget it.

1080
01:04:57,769 --> 01:04:58,853
Just give it to me.

1081
01:04:58,937 --> 01:05:00,688
I'll read it if I have time later. Or not.

1082
01:05:02,357 --> 01:05:04,776
<i>"Farewell Poem for the Woman.</i>

1083
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:09,739
When you hammer a nail,
the nail goes into the wall.

1084
01:05:10,323 --> 01:05:14,202
When the wind blows,
a persimmon falls from the branch.

1085
01:05:16,037 --> 01:05:17,330
His poem isn't that good.

1086
01:05:17,414 --> 01:05:21,084
But this woman does
whatever she wants to do.

1087
01:05:22,168 --> 01:05:23,837
She didn't die when we fired a gun at her.

1088
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,630
When we criticize her,
it doesn't affect her.

1089
01:05:25,713 --> 01:05:30,593
-Oh, my. What a troublemaker she is."
-Hey, I heard enough of that.

1090
01:05:30,677 --> 01:05:33,638
"But as you are leaving soon,

1091
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:35,432
please do me this favor.

1092
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:40,937
Take care. Don't get hurt.

1093
01:05:42,188 --> 01:05:43,523
Live a good life.

1094
01:05:45,567 --> 01:05:46,901
Don't forget us.

1095
01:05:51,448 --> 01:05:53,032
If you're exposed,

1096
01:05:53,533 --> 01:05:55,785
don't you dare

1097
01:05:57,537 --> 01:05:59,372
give them away my name."

1098
01:06:00,165 --> 01:06:02,417
Your name will be the first one I say.
Mark my words.

1099
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:08,214
We'll never be able to meet again
once you leave.

1100
01:06:14,053 --> 01:06:15,763
Can't you sing a song for us?

1101
01:06:22,395 --> 01:06:23,480
You know what?

1102
01:06:24,147 --> 01:06:26,024
If I sing a song for you,

1103
01:06:26,357 --> 01:06:27,901
you will never be able to forget me.

1104
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:29,652
How are you going to live without me?

1105
01:06:29,736 --> 01:06:31,237
I'm so concerned about you guys.

1106
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:35,742
<i>When the cold wind blows</i>

1107
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:40,914
<i>Just know that I have left</i>

1108
01:06:41,956 --> 01:06:45,877
<i>The fleeting breeze</i>

1109
01:06:46,586 --> 01:06:50,465
<i>Carries away only my yearning for you</i>

1110
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:54,469
<i>When the leaves fall</i>

1111
01:06:55,053 --> 01:06:59,724
<i>Just know that I have left</i>

1112
01:07:00,308 --> 01:07:03,895
<i>The falling leaves</i>

1113
01:07:04,479 --> 01:07:09,150
<i>Will only carry our memories together</i>

1114
01:07:11,277 --> 01:07:15,323
<i>When the cold wind blows</i>

1115
01:07:16,199 --> 01:07:21,204
<i>You will be lonely</i>

1116
01:07:23,373 --> 01:07:27,585
<i>Even so, do not</i>

1117
01:07:28,753 --> 01:07:33,341
<i>Think about me anymore</i>

1118
01:07:39,973 --> 01:07:45,144
<i>One time</i>

1119
01:07:45,562 --> 01:07:49,983
<i>Your warm gaze</i>

1120
01:07:50,567 --> 01:07:55,196
<i>Brought butterflies</i>

1121
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:59,242
<i>To my young heart</i>

1122
01:08:21,973 --> 01:08:24,058
You're really not going to see me off?

1123
01:08:25,435 --> 01:08:26,436
But I thought that

1124
01:08:27,061 --> 01:08:28,813
you would accompany me to the airport.

1125
01:08:30,481 --> 01:08:31,816
We should part our ways here.

1126
01:08:36,529 --> 01:08:38,865
Please take care on your way back.

1127
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:46,205
It might not be the case for you,

1128
01:08:47,749 --> 01:08:49,751
but I think I'll miss you.

1129
01:08:51,919 --> 01:08:54,047
I might think about you from time to time.

1130
01:08:56,341 --> 01:08:57,175
No.

1131
01:08:58,926 --> 01:09:00,178
I'll think about you often.

1132
01:09:05,058 --> 01:09:08,353
But we can't even ask
how each other is doing.

1133
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:11,064
That's a bit upsetting.

1134
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:16,527
The moment you leave here,

1135
01:09:17,028 --> 01:09:19,322
I hope you will forget everything
about this place and me

1136
01:09:20,490 --> 01:09:23,534
go back to the life you have been living
and stay healthy there.

1137
01:09:25,536 --> 01:09:27,705
Just pretend that you had a nightmare.

1138
01:09:37,757 --> 01:09:39,133
Instead of shaking my hand,

1139
01:09:41,386 --> 01:09:42,845
can you give me a hug?

1140
01:09:44,472 --> 01:09:45,848
I won't ever see you again.

1141
01:10:34,105 --> 01:10:35,356
They left, sir.

1142
01:11:01,716 --> 01:11:02,592
What is that?

1143
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:14,645
They are coming at us way too fast.

1144
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:31,454
Gwang Beom, are we okay?

1145
01:11:42,715 --> 01:11:44,008
Oh, no.

1146
01:12:53,744 --> 01:12:55,204
We need to get out of here now.

1147
01:12:57,582 --> 01:12:58,833
Oh, no.

1148
01:14:10,613 --> 01:14:11,530
Are you hurt?

1149
01:14:12,657 --> 01:14:13,658
No.

1150
01:14:14,241 --> 01:14:15,159
What about you?

1151
01:14:31,842 --> 01:14:32,677
Jeong Hyeok!

1152
01:14:48,567 --> 01:14:49,652
Jeong Hyeok.

1153
01:14:52,613 --> 01:14:54,782
Oh, no. Wake up.

1154
01:15:08,212 --> 01:15:11,215
You need to drive the truck
Se-ri will take tomorrow.

1155
01:15:11,298 --> 01:15:12,591
What about you?

1156
01:15:12,675 --> 01:15:14,385
I will secretly follow you guys.

1157
01:15:14,468 --> 01:15:16,387
I need to prepare
for the worst-case scenario.

1158
01:15:16,470 --> 01:15:17,763
Is this two-layered protection?

1159
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:20,850
Go on the picnic without me.

1160
01:15:20,975 --> 01:15:22,101
I need to prepare something.

1161
01:15:33,487 --> 01:15:36,240
Why do you need this spring?

1162
01:15:37,241 --> 01:15:39,493
Are you participating in a mountain race?

1163
01:15:50,171 --> 01:15:52,798
5TH COMPANY ARMORY
UNITY IN ONE MIND

1164
01:15:57,678 --> 01:15:59,764
-One more silencer for the pistol.
-Yes, sir.

1165
01:16:03,601 --> 01:16:05,519
Switch this
with a nine-millimeter semi-automatic.

1166
01:16:06,103 --> 01:16:07,980
-And give me a grenade launcher, too.
-Yes, sir.

1167
01:16:22,286 --> 01:16:24,622
LOG FOR ISSUED WEAPONS
RI JEONG HYEOK

1168
01:16:27,875 --> 01:16:29,001
Captain Ri.

1169
01:16:29,585 --> 01:16:30,878
Is everything okay?

1170
01:16:32,379 --> 01:16:33,631
I should hope so.

1171
01:17:02,535 --> 01:17:03,786
<i>I made a promise to her</i>

1172
01:17:04,912 --> 01:17:07,248
<i>that as long as she's in my sight,</i>
<i>I will protect her</i>

1173
01:17:09,083 --> 01:17:10,459
<i>no matter what.</i>

1174
01:18:13,731 --> 01:18:15,232
Jeong Hyeok.

1175
01:18:15,316 --> 01:18:17,484
<i>The man in the shootout must be him.</i>

1176
01:18:17,568 --> 01:18:19,486
Go to the airport first,
and we'll take care of--

1177
01:18:19,570 --> 01:18:20,696
What if he dies before that?

1178
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:23,407
<i>Seeing that hasn't made it back yet,</i>

1179
01:18:23,490 --> 01:18:25,326
<i>he must be suffering from an injury.</i>

1180
01:18:25,409 --> 01:18:27,494
Could something have happened for real?

1181
01:18:27,578 --> 01:18:29,580
She's not in Division 11.

1182
01:18:29,663 --> 01:18:31,332
Instead, she infiltrated

1183
01:18:31,415 --> 01:18:33,334
-our republic from the South.
-If you report her,

1184
01:18:33,417 --> 01:18:34,668
you'll hurt your man as well.

1185
01:18:34,752 --> 01:18:37,463
I don't care if he gets hurt or dies.

1186
01:18:37,546 --> 01:18:39,465
The very reason one gets the butterflies

1187
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:41,342
is because one knows not
how things will end.
