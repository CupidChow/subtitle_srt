CRASH LANDING ON YOU

2
00:00:52,228 --> 00:00:56,799
CRASH LANDING ON YOU

3
00:00:56,905 --> 00:00:59,825
ALL CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND BACKGROUND ARE FICTITIOUS

4
00:01:45,668 --> 00:01:47,128
We need to get out of here now.

5
00:01:47,837 --> 00:01:49,088
Oh, no.

6
00:02:43,559 --> 00:02:44,935
Are you hurt?

7
00:02:45,644 --> 00:02:46,478
No.

8
00:02:47,021 --> 00:02:47,980
What about you?

9
00:03:16,425 --> 00:03:17,509
Jeong Hyeok.

10
00:03:20,429 --> 00:03:22,640
Oh, no. Wake up.

11
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:26,518
What do I do? Jeong Hyeok.

12
00:03:28,854 --> 00:03:30,231
Gwang Beom, are you all right?

13
00:03:31,523 --> 00:03:32,691
Captain Ri.

14
00:03:32,775 --> 00:03:35,486
-Captain Ri.
-What do we do?

15
00:03:36,278 --> 00:03:38,280
We need to leave now.
Your flight is leaving soon.

16
00:03:38,364 --> 00:03:40,574
Oh, right. I don't have time.

17
00:03:42,493 --> 00:03:44,578
Gwang Beom, give me the car key.

18
00:03:44,662 --> 00:03:46,997
-What?
-You're injured too.

19
00:03:47,915 --> 00:03:50,876
You can't drive with your leg injured.
Give me the car key now!

20
00:03:51,669 --> 00:03:52,711
Come on.

21
00:04:05,975 --> 00:04:07,893
SUNAN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT
SARIWON

22
00:04:09,103 --> 00:04:10,229
Is there a hospital there?

23
00:04:10,312 --> 00:04:12,856
What are you talking about?
You need to go to the airport.

24
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:13,816
Answer me!

25
00:04:15,526 --> 00:04:17,152
There's a hospital in Sariwon, but...

26
00:04:23,701 --> 00:04:26,870
Don't do this. Go to the airport first,
and we'll take care of--

27
00:04:26,954 --> 00:04:28,998
What if he dies before that?

28
00:04:32,793 --> 00:04:36,255
Which direction now?
Hurry. We don't have much time.

29
00:04:37,673 --> 00:04:39,008
Turn left.

30
00:04:42,553 --> 00:04:45,597
He might end up dying in a car accident,
not the gunshot.

31
00:04:52,521 --> 00:04:54,440
UNDER CONSTRUCTION

32
00:04:55,024 --> 00:04:57,860
What do we do? It will take a long time
if we take a detour.

33
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,492
-Gwang Beom.
-Yes.

34
00:05:05,576 --> 00:05:07,536
Do you know what my favorite movie is?

35
00:05:08,454 --> 00:05:09,788
Pardon?

36
00:05:10,164 --> 00:05:12,666
<i>Mad Max: Fury Road.</i>

37
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,959
What?

38
00:05:20,672 --> 00:05:25,094
CRASH LANDING ON YOU

39
00:05:29,475 --> 00:05:30,726
EMERGENCY ROOM

40
00:05:30,809 --> 00:05:32,269
PEOPLE'S HOSPITAL OF SARIWON

41
00:05:32,353 --> 00:05:34,855
EMERGENCY ROOM

42
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:39,234
Blood pressure, 70 over 50.
He's unconscious.

43
00:05:39,318 --> 00:05:40,736
He's losing a lot of blood.

44
00:05:41,236 --> 00:05:43,614
It's a hemorrhagic shock.
He might have a cardiac arrest.

45
00:05:44,323 --> 00:05:46,700
Press the wound with gauze
and use vasopressors.

46
00:05:46,784 --> 00:05:48,410
-Get ready for surgery.
-Yes, Doctor.

47
00:05:49,495 --> 00:05:51,663
Se-ri, you can go now.

48
00:05:51,747 --> 00:05:54,083
If you hurry now,
you can make it before the flight leaves.

49
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:57,419
He's losing a lot of blood, so we need
extra blood for blood transfusion.

50
00:05:57,503 --> 00:06:00,047
We don't have it in our hospital,
so find it. It's an emergency.

51
00:06:00,589 --> 00:06:01,715
Pardon?

52
00:06:02,466 --> 00:06:03,759
What?

53
00:06:04,218 --> 00:06:05,511
We need to find blood?

54
00:06:06,095 --> 00:06:07,930
It looks like they don't have blood.

55
00:06:08,013 --> 00:06:10,599
Then what do we do? A person is dying.

56
00:06:10,891 --> 00:06:13,227
-She said it's an emergency.
-I wish I could give my blood,

57
00:06:14,228 --> 00:06:15,687
but my blood type doesn't match his.

58
00:06:17,022 --> 00:06:18,690
Blood type?

59
00:06:19,358 --> 00:06:21,235
-What's Jeong Hyeok's blood type?
-O.

60
00:06:21,318 --> 00:06:23,612
O? I can give him mine.

61
00:06:23,695 --> 00:06:26,740
Se-ri. If you don't go now,
you won't ever be able to go.

62
00:06:31,995 --> 00:06:32,996
Attention.

63
00:06:33,122 --> 00:06:37,418
When I call your name,
take your passport and get on board.

64
00:06:38,252 --> 00:06:42,589
As soon as you get on board,
you must give me back your passports.

65
00:06:43,424 --> 00:06:45,175
-Do you understand?
-Yes.

66
00:06:46,385 --> 00:06:47,511
-Kim Seon Suk.
-Yes.

67
00:06:48,887 --> 00:06:50,180
-Ra Yeong Sil.
-Yes.

68
00:06:52,891 --> 00:06:54,101
-Kim Jeong Sun.
-Yes.

69
00:06:55,978 --> 00:06:57,855
Coach.

70
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:00,065
About the reserve player.

71
00:07:01,608 --> 00:07:03,360
The one from the General Political Bureau.

72
00:07:03,569 --> 00:07:05,404
-Right.
-She hasn't come yet.

73
00:07:05,988 --> 00:07:07,990
And we can't reach
Captain Ri Jeong Hyeok either.

74
00:07:40,189 --> 00:07:41,315
She hasn't come yet, right?

75
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:43,984
You said she took off.

76
00:07:44,776 --> 00:07:47,446
Did Lieutenant Cho Cheol Gang stop her?

77
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,740
I told you.

78
00:07:50,324 --> 00:07:52,159
That man is good.

79
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,621
I get he's good, but where did he...

80
00:07:56,288 --> 00:07:58,081
Where did he send her?

81
00:07:58,165 --> 00:08:00,375
Hurry and contact Cho Cheol Gang.

82
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:02,377
How are those who got shot?

83
00:08:02,461 --> 00:08:05,047
They didn't get shot
on important body parts or bones.

84
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:06,215
If it was purposely done,

85
00:08:06,298 --> 00:08:09,218
the only explanation to it is
that the gunner has excellent techniques.

86
00:08:11,762 --> 00:08:13,096
Where is Ri Jeong Hyeok?

87
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,307
I just asked Company Five about him,

88
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:18,018
and they told me he went away
to attend a workshop.

89
00:08:18,602 --> 00:08:21,021
A workshop?
At the General Staff Department?

90
00:08:21,104 --> 00:08:23,357
Yes. They say
that is why he went to Pyongyang.

91
00:08:23,857 --> 00:08:24,733
Call the headquarters.

92
00:08:24,816 --> 00:08:26,902
-Look into his whereabouts.
-Yes, sir.

93
00:08:26,985 --> 00:08:29,404
-Seize Company Five's firearms logbook.
-Yes, sir.

94
00:08:31,448 --> 00:08:32,699
Please wait here.

95
00:08:47,464 --> 00:08:48,674
Se-ri.

96
00:08:49,675 --> 00:08:50,676
Gwang Beom.

97
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,265
We don't know

98
00:08:57,349 --> 00:08:58,976
how the surgery will go.

99
00:08:59,977 --> 00:09:02,563
Don't you think we should
call Jeong Hyeok's family?

100
00:09:03,063 --> 00:09:06,024
Captain Ri's phone is broken.

101
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:13,949
Okay.

102
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:17,286
You should go on
and get the rest of the treatment.

103
00:09:17,744 --> 00:09:18,787
I'll stay here.

104
00:09:29,965 --> 00:09:34,678
OPERATING ROOM

105
00:10:13,258 --> 00:10:15,344
Why don't we get our photo taken?

106
00:10:15,427 --> 00:10:16,511
I mean,

107
00:10:17,095 --> 00:10:20,724
we won't see each other again
after I leave. It will be a memento.

108
00:10:21,308 --> 00:10:22,893
There is no need for us to remember

109
00:10:23,935 --> 00:10:25,228
or keep a memento of each other.

110
00:10:25,312 --> 00:10:26,563
Look at you.

111
00:10:31,985 --> 00:10:33,779
After acting all arrogant...

112
00:10:35,906 --> 00:10:37,366
What a weirdo.

113
00:10:47,084 --> 00:10:48,418
-Tweezers.
-Tweezers.

114
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,675
Attach the styptic gauze.

115
00:10:56,843 --> 00:10:58,220
Plasma injection.

116
00:11:00,347 --> 00:11:01,807
Administer urokinase

117
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:03,892
-and general antibiotics.
-Okay.

118
00:11:05,977 --> 00:11:07,354
Tweezers.

119
00:11:12,234 --> 00:11:15,028
OPERATING ROOM

120
00:11:17,364 --> 00:11:18,740
Be careful.

121
00:11:20,575 --> 00:11:22,077
The surgery went well.

122
00:11:23,203 --> 00:11:25,539
I was worried
his main artery might have been damaged,

123
00:11:25,997 --> 00:11:27,416
but luckily, that wasn't the case.

124
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:30,961
Still, he has lost a lot of blood.
His blood pressure is yet to rise

125
00:11:31,044 --> 00:11:33,296
and he must watch out
for tetanus and blood poisoning.

126
00:11:33,797 --> 00:11:34,673
Above all,

127
00:11:34,756 --> 00:11:36,675
he must regain his consciousness soon.

128
00:11:37,426 --> 00:11:38,844
Let's see how it goes.

129
00:11:40,846 --> 00:11:41,680
Thank you.

PEOPLE'S HOSPITAL OF SARIWON

131
00:11:55,193 --> 00:11:56,278
Jeong Hyeok.

132
00:12:02,492 --> 00:12:03,577
I am not

133
00:12:04,619 --> 00:12:05,996
used to things like this.

134
00:12:08,665 --> 00:12:09,750
I have been only

135
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:15,172
loving myself and hating myself.

136
00:12:17,174 --> 00:12:19,176
And I have been only protecting myself

137
00:12:20,218 --> 00:12:21,595
and abandoning myself.

138
00:12:24,055 --> 00:12:26,016
All I had was myself.

139
00:12:26,767 --> 00:12:28,226
I had nobody else.

140
00:12:30,979 --> 00:12:33,440
So this is awkward for me.

141
00:12:36,568 --> 00:12:38,153
Having someone else

142
00:12:40,238 --> 00:12:41,406
that is not myself.

143
00:12:43,492 --> 00:12:44,868
<i>You looked at me,</i>

144
00:12:46,286 --> 00:12:47,704
<i>listened to me,</i>

145
00:12:49,414 --> 00:12:50,707
<i>smiled at me,</i>

146
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:53,043
<i>ate with me,</i>

147
00:12:54,377 --> 00:12:55,879
<i>kept the promise with me</i>

148
00:12:56,463 --> 00:12:59,299
<i>even if we didn't make any contract,</i>

149
00:13:00,884 --> 00:13:02,928
<i>and protected me.</i>

150
00:13:04,763 --> 00:13:05,764
You did...

151
00:13:09,976 --> 00:13:10,936
all...

152
00:13:11,686 --> 00:13:12,729
those things.

153
00:13:14,064 --> 00:13:15,106
All along,

154
00:13:17,067 --> 00:13:19,152
I had you by my side.

155
00:13:24,032 --> 00:13:25,492
Usually,

156
00:13:27,035 --> 00:13:28,203
I don't

157
00:13:29,162 --> 00:13:31,039
get scared,

158
00:13:35,836 --> 00:13:37,254
but now I'm a bit scared.

159
00:13:39,881 --> 00:13:41,716
I'm scared something might happen to you.

160
00:13:44,678 --> 00:13:45,929
Does this mean

161
00:13:48,306 --> 00:13:49,349
you have become

162
00:13:51,434 --> 00:13:53,311
a special person to me?

163
00:15:22,192 --> 00:15:23,234
Jeong Hyeok.

164
00:15:23,318 --> 00:15:26,029
I got an urgent message for you
from your family in Pyongyang.

165
00:15:27,155 --> 00:15:28,573
-What's that?
-Your brother

166
00:15:29,616 --> 00:15:31,952
died of an accident.

167
00:15:32,452 --> 00:15:35,163
You must hurry back to your country now.

168
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:12,450
Is that your piano?

169
00:16:14,285 --> 00:16:16,413
Can you play the piano?

170
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:21,209
Could you please play it for me?

171
00:16:28,633 --> 00:16:32,220
This might be my last time
playing the piano.

172
00:16:32,303 --> 00:16:33,596
Why?

173
00:16:35,098 --> 00:16:36,099
Well...

174
00:16:41,438 --> 00:16:44,941
I wrote a song for my brother.

175
00:16:49,904 --> 00:16:53,533
Would you be my last audience?

176
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:03,037
Jeong Hyeok.

177
00:19:04,706 --> 00:19:08,126
Well done. You did well.
I'm so proud of you.

178
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:10,044
Are you all right?

179
00:19:10,461 --> 00:19:11,588
Why are you here...

180
00:19:12,922 --> 00:19:15,967
Don't talk yet. You just woke up
from general anesthesia.

181
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:16,885
Later.

182
00:19:20,054 --> 00:19:22,807
You shouldn't sit up now.

183
00:19:31,608 --> 00:19:32,734
Did you

184
00:19:35,069 --> 00:19:36,029
not take the flight?

185
00:19:37,906 --> 00:19:39,991
I couldn't take the flight.

186
00:19:42,452 --> 00:19:43,369
Why?

187
00:19:44,412 --> 00:19:45,371
Well...

188
00:19:47,123 --> 00:19:49,167
I couldn't go because of the situation.

189
00:19:52,962 --> 00:19:54,756
You should have gone.

190
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:56,591
I know.

191
00:19:57,884 --> 00:19:59,636
I should have,

192
00:20:01,387 --> 00:20:04,307
but I couldn't.

193
00:20:04,933 --> 00:20:06,976
-Listen to--
-Just to send you back home,

194
00:20:08,269 --> 00:20:10,021
we all risked our lives.

195
00:20:11,856 --> 00:20:13,691
Do you know what that means?

196
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:15,401
I do.

197
00:20:16,194 --> 00:20:18,029
If you do, why are you still here?

198
00:20:18,529 --> 00:20:20,698
You made all that effort
go down the drain.

199
00:20:25,703 --> 00:20:29,874
How much more do you have to
trouble us until you feel sorry?

200
00:20:36,965 --> 00:20:39,092
It seems the anesthesia
hasn't completely worn off yet.

201
00:20:40,843 --> 00:20:41,844
And that's probably why

202
00:20:42,595 --> 00:20:44,389
you're showing your true feelings.

203
00:20:47,809 --> 00:20:50,520
The doctor said you needed
a complete rest.

204
00:20:51,145 --> 00:20:52,855
I don't want you to upset you,

205
00:20:53,856 --> 00:20:55,316
so I will leave for now.

206
00:20:56,192 --> 00:20:59,696
When you feel better later,
you can get mad at me then.

207
00:20:59,779 --> 00:21:02,073
RI JEONG HYEOK

208
00:21:16,379 --> 00:21:19,465
The patient woke up. Please check on him.

209
00:21:20,049 --> 00:21:22,927
I see. I will let the doctor know...

210
00:21:26,139 --> 00:21:29,559
The wound is clean
and there's no bloody discharge.

211
00:21:29,642 --> 00:21:31,019
Despite a lot of blood loss,

212
00:21:31,102 --> 00:21:33,521
your blood pressure has risen
thanks to the blood you received.

213
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:35,481
You're very lucky.

214
00:21:36,941 --> 00:21:39,360
Still, avoid too much exercise.

215
00:21:39,736 --> 00:21:41,988
You need to be treated well
for the next 15 days.

216
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,409
You and your girlfriend must be
meant to be.

217
00:21:46,492 --> 00:21:48,661
Luckily, your blood types matched.

218
00:21:48,745 --> 00:21:50,705
If she didn't give you her blood,

219
00:21:50,788 --> 00:21:52,790
-you could have been in big trouble.
-She's right.

220
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:56,294
I told her she would faint
if she cried after giving her blood away,

221
00:21:56,919 --> 00:21:58,921
but she cried the whole day.

222
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:01,466
-Where did she go?
-Before he woke up,

223
00:22:01,549 --> 00:22:03,009
she cried because he didn't wake up.

224
00:22:03,092 --> 00:22:05,053
After he woke up,
she cried because he woke up.

225
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:06,637
Is that so?

226
00:22:08,056 --> 00:22:09,098
Please rest well.

227
00:22:11,517 --> 00:22:13,603
Maybe she's crying again somewhere.

228
00:22:36,709 --> 00:22:37,960
I wish

229
00:22:39,837 --> 00:22:41,589
I could go somewhere,

230
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,092
but I don't have a car

231
00:22:45,343 --> 00:22:46,803
nor a place to go.

232
00:22:49,138 --> 00:22:50,306
How pathetic.

233
00:22:59,315 --> 00:23:00,274
Have you lost your mind?

234
00:23:00,942 --> 00:23:02,985
You can't move just yet.

235
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:05,863
It's cold. Do you want to catch a cold?

236
00:23:05,947 --> 00:23:07,949
It's not your place to worry about me.

237
00:23:08,658 --> 00:23:10,993
You got shot by a gun today.

238
00:23:11,077 --> 00:23:12,286
Seriously.

239
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:16,666
Hold onto me. Let's go in.

240
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,584
I didn't mean

241
00:23:20,044 --> 00:23:21,212
what I said earlier.

242
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:25,341
I'm sorry I was harsh to you.

243
00:23:27,718 --> 00:23:28,928
Okay.

244
00:23:31,472 --> 00:23:34,559
Fine. I accept your apology.

245
00:23:34,642 --> 00:23:36,102
You're not dead.

246
00:23:37,353 --> 00:23:39,230
I'm just thankful that you're alive.

247
00:23:39,814 --> 00:23:42,233
Compared to that,
forgiving you is nothing.

248
00:23:42,316 --> 00:23:44,986
Now hold onto me. Let's get in.

249
00:23:49,365 --> 00:23:50,324
What is it?

250
00:23:51,951 --> 00:23:53,661
You wanted to go home so badly.

251
00:23:56,372 --> 00:23:57,373
You should have just left.

252
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:01,794
I wanted to,

253
00:24:04,088 --> 00:24:06,424
but I couldn't. I told you.

254
00:24:07,216 --> 00:24:08,634
For once,

255
00:24:10,052 --> 00:24:12,305
I had to protect you too.

256
00:24:18,144 --> 00:24:21,022
Stop looking at me with such wistful eyes.

257
00:24:21,731 --> 00:24:22,982
Don't misunderstand me.

258
00:24:24,066 --> 00:24:26,194
-I'm just looking.
-No, you're not.

259
00:24:27,111 --> 00:24:30,823
For a second,
your eyes were so very wistful.

260
00:24:34,202 --> 00:24:35,244
See?

261
00:24:35,828 --> 00:24:38,831
Even now, you're looking at me
with those wistful eyes.

262
00:25:17,745 --> 00:25:19,288
FIREARMS LOGBOOK

263
00:25:20,831 --> 00:25:23,000
CAPTAIN RI JEONG HYEOK

264
00:25:24,502 --> 00:25:27,004
The man in the shootout must be him.

265
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:31,884
Seeing that hasn't made it back yet,
he must be suffering from an injury.

266
00:25:33,177 --> 00:25:35,179
From this moment forward,
everyone at the switchboard

267
00:25:35,263 --> 00:25:36,597
will be on emergency standby.

268
00:25:36,681 --> 00:25:38,808
-Yes, sir.
-Call every hospital

269
00:25:38,891 --> 00:25:41,936
that is within a radius of 20km
of the place of the gunfight.

270
00:25:42,019 --> 00:25:44,355
Call all the hospitals
and doctors' offices

271
00:25:44,438 --> 00:25:46,357
-in even tiny villages.
-Yes, sir.

272
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,150
-Hello?
-Is this...

273
00:25:48,234 --> 00:25:49,819
Is this the emergency room in Songnim?

274
00:25:49,902 --> 00:25:53,155
Do you have a patient
called Captain Ri Jeong Hyeok?

275
00:25:53,739 --> 00:25:54,907
Okay.

276
00:25:54,991 --> 00:25:56,993
Is there a patient named
Ri Jeong Hyeok there?

277
00:25:57,368 --> 00:25:58,995
Is this People's Hospital of Pungdeok-ri?

278
00:25:59,078 --> 00:26:00,788
This is Unit 527.

279
00:26:00,871 --> 00:26:02,582
Why won't take pick up the phone?

280
00:26:07,044 --> 00:26:08,838
MR. RI

281
00:26:11,674 --> 00:26:14,343
<i>The person you have reached
is not available.</i>

282
00:26:16,596 --> 00:26:19,098
Why won't he pick up the phone?

283
00:26:21,058 --> 00:26:23,561
<i>The person you have reached
is not available.</i>

284
00:26:26,188 --> 00:26:28,065
What happened?
Did you meet Cho Cheol Gang?

285
00:26:28,149 --> 00:26:30,359
-Yes.
-Where is Yoon Se-ri?

286
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,486
He said he didn't know either.

287
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,655
What are you talking about?

288
00:26:34,739 --> 00:26:36,824
They mobilized a truck corps
to stop her, but--

289
00:26:36,907 --> 00:26:39,243
A truck corps? Is there such a corps?

290
00:26:39,869 --> 00:26:41,203
There's no such a corps.

291
00:26:41,412 --> 00:26:44,165
They're Cho Cheol Kang's private troops.

292
00:26:45,666 --> 00:26:49,253
So did they make
a car accident or something?

293
00:26:49,837 --> 00:26:51,047
-With the trucks?
-Yes.

294
00:26:52,757 --> 00:26:54,508
But apparently, Yoon Se-ri disappeared.

295
00:26:55,217 --> 00:26:56,385
Disappeared?

296
00:26:56,469 --> 00:26:59,013
Cho is looking for her.
I'm sure he'll find her soon.

297
00:26:59,722 --> 00:27:03,851
How could you make a car accident?
You could have hurt her.

298
00:27:04,435 --> 00:27:05,436
Hey.

299
00:27:05,936 --> 00:27:08,356
Wasn't our goal to keep her
from going back to South Korea

300
00:27:08,439 --> 00:27:09,690
no matter what happens to her?

301
00:27:09,774 --> 00:27:10,816
Are you saying

302
00:27:11,901 --> 00:27:13,444
you don't mind killing her?

303
00:27:14,612 --> 00:27:16,364
I thought we didn't mind that.

304
00:27:21,118 --> 00:27:22,078
You must be busy.

305
00:27:23,537 --> 00:27:24,538
What?

306
00:27:24,622 --> 00:27:27,208
You want to be human
while being a con man.

307
00:27:28,125 --> 00:27:29,251
I'm sure you're busy.

308
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,801
Oh, my.

309
00:27:38,386 --> 00:27:39,595
Who is that?

310
00:27:46,394 --> 00:27:48,479
That's the bitch from earlier.

311
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:51,482
Sam Suk has just left,

312
00:27:52,066 --> 00:27:54,151
and there she enters,
as if she's been waiting.

313
00:27:54,235 --> 00:27:55,319
I will bring tears

314
00:27:55,903 --> 00:27:57,822
to that bitch's eyes.

315
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,702
Looking at her mother's face,
that might be hard.

316
00:28:03,577 --> 00:28:04,662
Then?

317
00:28:05,746 --> 00:28:08,541
Make her show us respect. That's enough.

318
00:28:14,672 --> 00:28:15,756
I heard

319
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:18,676
the head of the village was here.

320
00:28:19,802 --> 00:28:21,929
She just came,
and she's talking informally.

321
00:28:29,854 --> 00:28:31,814
That's me. Who are you?

322
00:28:35,025 --> 00:28:38,988
I'm the mother of the fiancée
of Captain Ri Jeong Hyeok

323
00:28:39,071 --> 00:28:42,658
of the frontline unit.

324
00:28:42,825 --> 00:28:45,077
I'm thinking of getting an apartment here.

325
00:28:45,161 --> 00:28:46,203
That would be difficult.

326
00:28:48,289 --> 00:28:50,291
Why is it difficult?

327
00:28:50,458 --> 00:28:53,544
It's difficult
because there's no empty place.

328
00:28:53,627 --> 00:28:57,381
I know the tall apartment building
at the entrance of the village is empty.

329
00:28:57,465 --> 00:28:59,175
I heard all about it.

330
00:28:59,425 --> 00:29:00,468
By the way,

331
00:29:01,969 --> 00:29:05,389
you seem way younger than me.

332
00:29:05,473 --> 00:29:08,225
Is that how you show respect
to the elderly?

333
00:29:10,978 --> 00:29:13,314
Let's just go.
We can find a place elsewhere.

334
00:29:13,397 --> 00:29:15,983
-Let go of me.
-I didn't hold you.

335
00:29:19,695 --> 00:29:23,783
I know that you're uneducated,
but this is just outrageous.

336
00:29:23,908 --> 00:29:26,952
You're supposed to be kind to strangers.

337
00:29:27,453 --> 00:29:29,914
What's with this attitude?

338
00:29:29,997 --> 00:29:31,415
I don't get what you're saying.

339
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:34,877
What's with all the fuss?

340
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:39,715
Who are you?

341
00:29:44,178 --> 00:29:48,098
I'm the wife of the Senior Colonel,

342
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:50,184
who is the boss

343
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:52,812
of Captain Ri Jeong Hyeok.

344
00:29:57,233 --> 00:29:59,902
I didn't expect to see
such a noble person on the street.

345
00:30:00,069 --> 00:30:02,780
Dan, come on and say hello to her.

346
00:30:07,159 --> 00:30:11,205
How about we drop all this
and have a peaceful conversation

347
00:30:11,288 --> 00:30:14,625
over a glass of juice? What do you say?

348
00:30:14,708 --> 00:30:16,252
We don't need juice.

349
00:30:17,002 --> 00:30:19,171
Just tell us why you need an apartment.

350
00:30:21,382 --> 00:30:24,301
My daughter is marrying Captain Ri soon.

351
00:30:25,094 --> 00:30:26,971
So I'm here to find them an apartment.

352
00:30:29,723 --> 00:30:30,975
I see.

353
00:30:32,059 --> 00:30:33,769
-However--
-Oh, right.

354
00:30:34,812 --> 00:30:36,230
Look at me, being all forgetful.

355
00:30:36,814 --> 00:30:41,402
I'm running a department store
in Pyongyang.

356
00:30:42,903 --> 00:30:44,071
That's probably

357
00:30:45,239 --> 00:30:49,243
why I have these things in my bag.

358
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:50,744
They're so heavy.

359
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:56,166
Next time I come,

360
00:30:56,250 --> 00:31:00,421
I will make sure to bring more things
that you might need.

361
00:31:03,591 --> 00:31:06,385
Here's one more for you.

362
00:31:08,095 --> 00:31:11,640
This is where my aunt lives,

363
00:31:11,724 --> 00:31:15,311
so I know very well about this place.
Why don't you go up and take a look?

364
00:31:16,562 --> 00:31:17,605
Please.

365
00:31:20,983 --> 00:31:24,820
After all, a marriage has to be
consented by both families.

366
00:31:27,364 --> 00:31:31,702
Usually, it doesn't hurt
to listen to your parents.

367
00:31:31,785 --> 00:31:34,121
-Right?
-I learned that from my experience.

368
00:31:34,204 --> 00:31:36,332
-Right?
-I agree.

369
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:39,001
Let's go.

370
00:31:40,294 --> 00:31:43,213
All the rooms
in this tall apartment building

371
00:31:43,505 --> 00:31:46,383
has open mountain views.

372
00:31:46,467 --> 00:31:47,843
The location is excellent too.

373
00:31:47,927 --> 00:31:49,887
Water in the back
and mountains in the front.

374
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:52,097
-It's the other way round.
-Right, yes.

375
00:31:52,181 --> 00:31:56,101
All the key facilities in the village
are only five minutes away by foot.

376
00:31:57,311 --> 00:31:59,563
Thank you. This way, please.

377
00:32:00,147 --> 00:32:02,107
She got two.

378
00:32:02,608 --> 00:32:03,943
Welcome.

379
00:32:08,948 --> 00:32:10,115
Which floor are you going to?

380
00:32:10,199 --> 00:32:12,660
Comrade Operator. Fifth floor, please.

381
00:32:13,494 --> 00:32:15,329
The fifth floor is the perfect floor.

382
00:32:21,585 --> 00:32:24,838
Does it stop often?

383
00:32:26,757 --> 00:32:30,052
This is why I said it's the perfect floor.

384
00:32:30,344 --> 00:32:32,721
A person I know lives on the 17th floor,

385
00:32:32,805 --> 00:32:36,058
and said when there's a blackout,
he couldn't walk up all the stairs

386
00:32:36,141 --> 00:32:38,686
so he went back to the camp
and slept there.

387
00:32:38,811 --> 00:32:40,813
No wonder. The 17th floor is very high.

388
00:32:40,896 --> 00:32:42,189
-It is indeed.
-For sure.

389
00:32:42,272 --> 00:32:44,191
Five floors are walkable.

390
00:32:44,274 --> 00:32:46,777
Let's pull the doors open together.

391
00:32:47,277 --> 00:32:48,362
Don't worry.

392
00:32:53,909 --> 00:32:54,827
Come up.

393
00:32:55,828 --> 00:32:58,330
-The door opens really smoothly.
-Hold my hand.

394
00:32:59,248 --> 00:33:00,082
Come on.

395
00:33:00,332 --> 00:33:02,001
Don't worry.

396
00:33:02,376 --> 00:33:04,086
-Come on.
-Come on out.

397
00:33:04,586 --> 00:33:06,338
Come on. There you go.

398
00:33:06,422 --> 00:33:09,216
Look at the European-style wallpaper.

399
00:33:09,675 --> 00:33:11,093
Isn't it just the ultimate luxury?

400
00:33:13,053 --> 00:33:15,472
The landlord graduated
Pyongyang University of Fine Arts.

401
00:33:15,556 --> 00:33:17,766
That's probably why this apartment is
so gorgeous.

402
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:18,976
-That's right.
-Right?

403
00:33:19,059 --> 00:33:22,855
Oh, my. Isn't this the famous Sung fridge?

404
00:33:23,439 --> 00:33:25,607
It's a perfect size. I love it.

405
00:33:28,736 --> 00:33:31,405
It's a perfect size to keep books inside.

406
00:33:32,072 --> 00:33:34,241
In the bottom shelves,
you can put your clothes.

407
00:33:36,702 --> 00:33:38,203
The electricity isn't stable,

408
00:33:38,287 --> 00:33:41,373
so fridges are often just for decoration.

409
00:33:42,708 --> 00:33:45,544
It must be very convenient
to store things.

410
00:33:45,627 --> 00:33:46,920
-Right?
-For sure.

411
00:33:50,841 --> 00:33:53,677
Goodness. I haven't seen you
since you were a baby.

412
00:33:55,095 --> 00:33:58,140
-You're all grown up now.
-I mean, do they raise a goat in here?

413
00:33:58,223 --> 00:34:00,476
It's an eco-friendly way
of using the space.

414
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:03,145
I'm sure you haven't
even imagined this in Pyongyang.

415
00:34:03,729 --> 00:34:06,106
My aunt is raising it

416
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:09,151
so she can throw a party
when her son goes to college.

417
00:34:09,651 --> 00:34:11,862
But I don't think he's smart enough.

418
00:34:12,446 --> 00:34:14,198
-Oh, my.
-Hey.

419
00:34:14,281 --> 00:34:16,492
Parents can't force their kids to study.

420
00:34:16,575 --> 00:34:19,328
-That's true.
-That boy needs to be beaten up.

421
00:34:21,205 --> 00:34:23,165
The goat has grown
into a perfect size to eat.

422
00:34:33,801 --> 00:34:36,887
They raise chickens too?

423
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:38,806
We all raise chickens on the terrace.

424
00:34:38,931 --> 00:34:41,350
Where do you raise chickens
in Pyongyang then?

425
00:34:41,934 --> 00:34:44,228
Oh, my. Eggs.

426
00:34:45,229 --> 00:34:46,230
Well done.

427
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,191
Mom.

428
00:34:49,858 --> 00:34:52,319
-Do you want to continue the tour?
-Why?

429
00:34:52,402 --> 00:34:55,447
-I'll go to Jeong Hyeok.
-Okay, sure.

430
00:34:56,532 --> 00:34:57,699
Gosh, what was that?

431
00:35:01,036 --> 00:35:03,497
<i>The person you have reached
is not available.</i>

432
00:35:05,999 --> 00:35:08,460
Could something have happened for real?

433
00:35:21,723 --> 00:35:24,268
What? What is she doing here?

434
00:35:51,044 --> 00:35:52,129
Goodness!

435
00:35:53,422 --> 00:35:54,506
What are you doing here?

436
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:57,050
That's my question.
What are you doing, Ms. Seo Dan?

437
00:35:57,634 --> 00:36:00,804
Oh, right. You came to this village
when I gave you a ride last time.

438
00:36:01,305 --> 00:36:02,681
Why did you come here again?

439
00:36:03,265 --> 00:36:05,809
-This is where my fiancé lives.
-Fiancé?

440
00:36:05,893 --> 00:36:07,644
-This is?
-What's wrong?

441
00:36:09,188 --> 00:36:11,815
Well, I know this house too.

442
00:36:12,399 --> 00:36:14,276
Are you saying you know Ri Jeong Hyeok?

443
00:36:14,651 --> 00:36:16,028
Right. Mr. Ri.

444
00:36:16,778 --> 00:36:19,323
I'm also waiting for him now.
He's not home.

445
00:36:19,448 --> 00:36:22,701
If you like, you can wait for him
in my car. It's cold.

446
00:36:25,621 --> 00:36:27,039
You look better with your hair down.

447
00:36:27,873 --> 00:36:28,832
I mean, I saw you.

448
00:36:31,251 --> 00:36:33,003
You look better with your hair down.

449
00:36:33,921 --> 00:36:35,797
I'm not sure

450
00:36:38,133 --> 00:36:39,134
what you're talking about.

451
00:36:41,428 --> 00:36:42,596
I'm sure you know.

452
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,451
You have no fever.

453
00:37:05,244 --> 00:37:07,079
But why is your face so red?

454
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:09,873
No, it's not.

455
00:37:10,749 --> 00:37:13,585
It's red. Did you something
you're not supposed to see?

456
00:37:15,796 --> 00:37:18,465
Well, I'm the one who saw something
I'm not supposed to see.

457
00:37:18,548 --> 00:37:20,175
Last night,

458
00:37:20,259 --> 00:37:25,847
I saw two people having a deep kiss
out there in the dark.

459
00:37:28,141 --> 00:37:29,393
The world must be near its end.

460
00:37:29,685 --> 00:37:32,062
It was in the middle of the night.
How vulgar is that?

461
00:37:32,145 --> 00:37:33,397
Everyone is asleep at that hour.

462
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:36,233
When everyone is asleep,
they should be asleep too.

463
00:37:36,316 --> 00:37:38,735
Why did they have to come out
in the rain and do that?

464
00:37:39,236 --> 00:37:41,655
I'm sure it wasn't that bad.

465
00:37:41,738 --> 00:37:45,158
I'm the one who saw it,
and I say it was bad. What do you know?

466
00:37:47,369 --> 00:37:48,912
Why is your blood pressure rising?

467
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:51,832
Your pulse is fast too.

468
00:37:52,416 --> 00:37:53,500
I'm okay.

469
00:37:54,042 --> 00:37:56,545
No, you're not.
You're supposed to take a complete rest.

470
00:37:57,379 --> 00:37:59,423
I'll tell the doctor about it.

471
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,395
What did you say?

472
00:38:14,479 --> 00:38:15,564
I didn't say anything.

473
00:38:18,275 --> 00:38:19,359
You didn't.

474
00:38:21,361 --> 00:38:22,404
I didn't.

475
00:38:24,698 --> 00:38:27,242
What are you doing, by the way?

476
00:38:28,243 --> 00:38:32,247
You got a hole in your uniform.
Because of the gunshot.

477
00:38:33,165 --> 00:38:35,334
I washed it to get the blood off.

478
00:38:35,417 --> 00:38:38,045
I'll make sure to sew it up nicely.

479
00:38:38,628 --> 00:38:39,713
I may not look like it,

480
00:38:40,422 --> 00:38:44,509
but I have the Asian fashion industry
in the palm of my hand.

481
00:38:53,977 --> 00:38:58,565
Now, we have three options.

482
00:38:59,024 --> 00:38:59,858
Number one.

483
00:38:59,941 --> 00:39:02,986
Pretend nothing happened last night
and act like before.

484
00:39:03,904 --> 00:39:04,780
Number two.

485
00:39:04,863 --> 00:39:08,617
Act as if nothing happened last night
and never talk about it.

486
00:39:09,868 --> 00:39:12,079
-Aren't they the same?
-They're slightly different.

487
00:39:13,205 --> 00:39:14,289
What's number three?

488
00:39:15,874 --> 00:39:17,876
Honestly, it's not like we are teenagers.

489
00:39:18,627 --> 00:39:20,670
Don't pressure each other
over such a trivial thing.

490
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,964
Is that also slightly different?

491
00:39:23,799 --> 00:39:25,092
Of course it is.

492
00:39:25,759 --> 00:39:27,219
Let's go with number three.

493
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:32,849
-You want to go with number three?
-Yes.

494
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,939
It looks like what happened last night
is pressuring you a lot.

495
00:39:39,689 --> 00:39:42,776
-You told me to choose one, so--
-Right. I did say that.

496
00:39:42,984 --> 00:39:45,987
You made a good choice.

497
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:49,699
But anyway,
it means you did feel pressure, right?

498
00:39:50,992 --> 00:39:53,537
I understand though.
Yesterday, you got shot,

499
00:39:54,121 --> 00:39:56,415
you got surgery,
you were still under anesthesia,

500
00:39:56,498 --> 00:40:00,794
it was pouring, and I was crying.

501
00:40:00,877 --> 00:40:02,546
So you probably did it on impulse.

502
00:40:03,713 --> 00:40:05,757
I understand.

503
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,469
-But--
-I'm not giving you any pressure.

504
00:40:09,553 --> 00:40:10,637
I hate that.

505
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,473
Such a minor physical contact
is not that big a deal to me.

506
00:40:13,682 --> 00:40:15,016
Let's both be cool about it.

507
00:40:20,272 --> 00:40:21,815
I will return the sewing box.

508
00:40:49,676 --> 00:40:50,760
Se-ri.

509
00:40:54,598 --> 00:40:55,765
How did you come here?

510
00:40:55,849 --> 00:40:58,059
Because we heard the sad news, obviously.

511
00:40:58,143 --> 00:41:00,645
We made up an excuse,
so we should bring some cement back.

512
00:41:01,396 --> 00:41:03,106
Is Captain Ri all right?

513
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:05,567
I was so surprised to hear about him.

514
00:41:05,817 --> 00:41:08,028
He's okay now. Don't worry.

515
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:12,491
The sadder news is that
you didn't leave, again.

516
00:41:13,074 --> 00:41:14,743
To us, it's devastating news.

517
00:41:14,826 --> 00:41:18,788
He may say so, but when he heard the news,
he was very worried about you.

518
00:41:21,291 --> 00:41:22,334
Is that true?

519
00:41:23,168 --> 00:41:24,127
Worry, my foot.

520
00:41:25,795 --> 00:41:27,672
We brought some food.

521
00:41:28,381 --> 00:41:30,926
That's good. This hospital gives rice
without side dishes.

522
00:41:31,009 --> 00:41:32,886
It's up to the patients' to make them.

523
00:41:32,969 --> 00:41:35,931
I bought some things
and made a lunchbox earlier.

524
00:41:36,515 --> 00:41:38,099
What is "lunchbox"?

525
00:41:38,183 --> 00:41:39,059
A packed lunch.

526
00:41:39,643 --> 00:41:40,644
I see.

527
00:41:41,645 --> 00:41:42,854
Did you make it yourself?

528
00:41:42,938 --> 00:41:44,105
Yes.

529
00:41:44,189 --> 00:41:46,441
Did you make the patient eat it?

530
00:41:46,525 --> 00:41:48,109
That's right.

531
00:41:48,193 --> 00:41:51,696
Gosh, it must have been

532
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:54,407
as lethal as a bomb.

533
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:55,992
Let's go.

534
00:41:57,035 --> 00:42:00,205
She should have been more considerate
of the patient.

535
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:04,302
He fell asleep!

536
00:42:05,137 --> 00:42:07,097
He was awake just now.

537
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:13,186
Captain Ri looks very pale.

538
00:42:13,353 --> 00:42:15,021
Are you sure he is recovering?

539
00:42:16,857 --> 00:42:19,943
It's strange to see someone so spirited
lying on a bed.

540
00:42:20,193 --> 00:42:22,696
He looks a bit different, doesn't he?

541
00:42:22,779 --> 00:42:25,407
He doesn't look different at all.

542
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:26,867
He does.

543
00:42:27,451 --> 00:42:28,618
How did he get shot?

544
00:42:28,702 --> 00:42:30,871
He shouldn't have pretended to be agile.

545
00:42:31,371 --> 00:42:32,747
Don't say that.

546
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:35,167
He must be flustered to be bedridden.

547
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:36,960
Embarrassed is more like it.

548
00:42:37,169 --> 00:42:39,171
-Hey.
-He got shot during operation.

549
00:42:39,254 --> 00:42:41,047
Weren't you listening earlier?

550
00:42:41,131 --> 00:42:42,883
He was trying to protect me.

551
00:42:42,966 --> 00:42:45,218
He got shot in my stead.

552
00:42:46,845 --> 00:42:48,847
He couldn't dodge the bullet.

553
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:50,265
-I see.
-I see.

554
00:42:50,348 --> 00:42:52,184
I wouldn't say he got shot in your stead.

555
00:42:52,267 --> 00:42:55,770
We can't rule out that possibility
that Captain Ri failed

556
00:42:55,854 --> 00:42:58,106
to dodge the bullet
because it was too fast.

557
00:42:58,690 --> 00:42:59,858
We know how it is.

558
00:43:00,442 --> 00:43:01,776
The real life isn't like a movie.

559
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:04,446
You can't dodge a bullet.

560
00:43:10,494 --> 00:43:12,037
Thank you for coming.

561
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,497
You should get going now.

562
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:15,916
But we came a long way.

563
00:43:15,999 --> 00:43:18,710
-Do you have a soft drink?
-Stop talking nonsense

564
00:43:18,793 --> 00:43:20,629
-and go.
-Hey, don't push me.

565
00:43:20,712 --> 00:43:21,922
Take care.

566
00:43:22,088 --> 00:43:23,340
We will come again.

567
00:43:24,341 --> 00:43:26,426
Take care. Bye.

568
00:43:34,684 --> 00:43:35,894
Open your eyes.

569
00:43:36,853 --> 00:43:38,855
Why would you pretend to be asleep?

570
00:43:38,939 --> 00:43:40,148
You are such a bad actor.

571
00:43:46,863 --> 00:43:47,739
Did they leave?

572
00:43:47,822 --> 00:43:49,491
Of course they did.

573
00:43:51,576 --> 00:43:53,828
I am too ashamed to face them.

574
00:43:56,831 --> 00:43:58,083
Tell me.

575
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:00,126
Did you fail to dodge?

576
00:44:06,216 --> 00:44:07,425
Did you?

577
00:44:11,638 --> 00:44:13,014
I didn't try to dodge.

578
00:44:14,266 --> 00:44:17,269
-Why not?
-Had I dodged, you would have gotten shot.

579
00:44:22,649 --> 00:44:24,276
I am touched.

580
00:44:25,527 --> 00:44:26,528
It's like a movie.

581
00:44:28,196 --> 00:44:30,031
But don't do that from now on.

582
00:44:30,532 --> 00:44:32,826
I doubt we will face
such a situation again.

583
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:36,079
Even if we do,

584
00:44:36,413 --> 00:44:39,040
don't even try to look cool

585
00:44:39,666 --> 00:44:40,625
and dodge.

586
00:44:41,876 --> 00:44:43,128
The same goes for you.

587
00:44:44,754 --> 00:44:48,008
If something like this happens again,
don't stay behind because of me.

588
00:44:48,216 --> 00:44:49,342
Just go.

589
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:52,262
You always have to have the last word.

590
00:44:52,721 --> 00:44:53,847
I mean it.

591
00:44:54,764 --> 00:44:57,934
To think that you could have gone back
to Seoul

592
00:44:59,436 --> 00:45:00,854
makes my heart ache.

593
00:45:01,396 --> 00:45:03,773
Of course I have a back-up plan.

594
00:45:03,857 --> 00:45:06,985
Gu Seung-jun promised
to send my regards to my family.

595
00:45:07,444 --> 00:45:10,363
I am sure that they know
I am alive by now.

596
00:45:23,835 --> 00:45:24,878
It's cold.

597
00:45:28,798 --> 00:45:30,258
What's the name of the game?

598
00:45:30,842 --> 00:45:31,926
<i>Boy General.</i>

599
00:45:32,677 --> 00:45:33,970
Is it fun?

600
00:45:35,597 --> 00:45:36,681
Let me play it once.

601
00:45:37,766 --> 00:45:39,559
Seo Dan, how old are you?

602
00:45:40,101 --> 00:45:41,144
You are so small-minded.

603
00:45:41,728 --> 00:45:43,730
What was the name of the game?
I will download it.

604
00:45:43,813 --> 00:45:45,523
-You can't download it.
-Sure I can.

605
00:45:45,607 --> 00:45:47,192
It must be on the App Store.

606
00:45:47,275 --> 00:45:49,110
Cellphones here don't have such a thing.

607
00:45:49,194 --> 00:45:50,779
When you go to Pyongyang,

608
00:45:51,321 --> 00:45:53,948
go to the App Market
and ask them to download it.

609
00:45:54,532 --> 00:45:55,492
App, what?

610
00:45:56,076 --> 00:45:57,452
App Market.

611
00:45:58,286 --> 00:46:00,580
It's at Bongsa Market at Pyongyang.

612
00:46:00,664 --> 00:46:01,873
No way.

613
00:46:02,624 --> 00:46:04,417
Do I need to buy an app
at an actual market?

614
00:46:04,501 --> 00:46:06,795
How many times do you need to ask?

615
00:46:06,878 --> 00:46:08,088
Let me concentrate.

616
00:46:09,714 --> 00:46:10,674
Weren't you

617
00:46:10,965 --> 00:46:12,717
waiting for your fiancé?

618
00:46:12,801 --> 00:46:16,304
I guess you aren't worried about
being unable to reach him.

619
00:46:16,888 --> 00:46:18,807
This isn't time to concentrate on a game.

620
00:46:19,974 --> 00:46:21,810
I didn't concentrate on it.

621
00:46:22,394 --> 00:46:23,395
Aren't you hungry?

622
00:46:23,645 --> 00:46:24,562
I am.

623
00:46:24,646 --> 00:46:27,399
Why don't we go and have some noodles?

624
00:46:27,732 --> 00:46:28,983
Noodles, my foot.

625
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:45,208
By the way, how did you meet your fiancé?

626
00:46:46,084 --> 00:46:48,211
The decision was made a long time ago.

627
00:46:48,503 --> 00:46:50,255
I see. It's an arranged marriage.

628
00:46:50,338 --> 00:46:51,339
Yes.

629
00:46:52,924 --> 00:46:54,217
Did you set the wedding date?

630
00:46:55,427 --> 00:46:56,594
It's next month.

631
00:46:56,678 --> 00:46:58,805
But your fiancé goes to the hotel
with another woman.

632
00:47:01,057 --> 00:47:03,435
It's not like that.
They use separate rooms.

633
00:47:03,518 --> 00:47:04,728
They do everything separately.

634
00:47:04,811 --> 00:47:07,272
They are carrying out a secret operation.

635
00:47:07,856 --> 00:47:09,649
-Did he confess his love to you?
-He...

636
00:47:12,777 --> 00:47:13,778
Well,

637
00:47:14,696 --> 00:47:15,905
we will get married soon.

638
00:47:15,989 --> 00:47:16,990
Hey, come on.

639
00:47:17,699 --> 00:47:20,952
I told you on the rooftop that I seem to
have a few things to teach you.

640
00:47:21,035 --> 00:47:22,787
Listen carefully.

641
00:47:22,871 --> 00:47:24,706
It might sound coldhearted,

642
00:47:25,290 --> 00:47:28,626
but it's hard for you and your fiancé
to feel a romantic attraction.

643
00:47:30,336 --> 00:47:32,505
-Why not?
-The ending is marriage.

644
00:47:33,089 --> 00:47:34,340
What about it?

645
00:47:34,424 --> 00:47:36,426
You are suddenly talking down to me.
In any case,

646
00:47:36,509 --> 00:47:38,219
The very reason one gets the butterflies

647
00:47:38,303 --> 00:47:40,430
is because one knows not
how things will end.

648
00:47:40,513 --> 00:47:42,098
Will we continue to date? Will we part?

649
00:47:42,182 --> 00:47:43,892
Will I get turned down? Will we be happy?

650
00:47:43,975 --> 00:47:45,894
We have no way of knowing!

651
00:47:45,977 --> 00:47:47,604
You need to be curious and anxious.

652
00:47:47,687 --> 00:47:50,273
Your heart needs to beat fast
to feel a romantic attraction.

653
00:47:51,191 --> 00:47:53,985
You think it's impossible
because we set the wedding date.

654
00:47:55,236 --> 00:47:58,114
You should have captured his heart
before setting the wedding date.

655
00:48:03,244 --> 00:48:04,704
Give me a bottle of <i>soju</i>.

656
00:48:05,205 --> 00:48:06,039
Okay.

657
00:48:07,999 --> 00:48:09,334
To set the wedding date,

658
00:48:09,417 --> 00:48:11,085
couples have dinner, drink tea,

659
00:48:11,169 --> 00:48:12,587
go to a movie, confess love,

660
00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:14,214
fight, stay up all night,

661
00:48:14,297 --> 00:48:17,342
break up, run toward each other,
and do all sorts of crazy things.

662
00:48:17,425 --> 00:48:19,093
But you set the wedding date.

663
00:48:19,677 --> 00:48:20,970
There is nothing to do now.

664
00:48:21,763 --> 00:48:23,389
There is no excitement.

665
00:48:23,473 --> 00:48:25,600
That's the downside
of an arranged marriage.

666
00:48:26,392 --> 00:48:27,894
How do you know so well?

667
00:48:29,854 --> 00:48:31,439
I almost had an arranged marriage.

668
00:48:32,315 --> 00:48:33,441
But it fell apart.

669
00:48:35,235 --> 00:48:38,321
Once that happened,
my heart began to flutter.

670
00:48:40,156 --> 00:48:41,658
I couldn't stop thinking about her.

671
00:48:50,166 --> 00:48:51,459
I will turn off the light.

672
00:48:57,882 --> 00:48:59,634
Will you sleep there again?

673
00:49:02,095 --> 00:49:03,221
What other choice do I have?

674
00:49:04,305 --> 00:49:06,474
It will be cold due to the frigid air
from the floor.

675
00:49:08,101 --> 00:49:09,018
Sleep here.

676
00:49:17,026 --> 00:49:18,653
Should I do that?

677
00:49:19,612 --> 00:49:22,240
It is cold down here.
I almost got a facial paralysis yesterday.

678
00:49:24,659 --> 00:49:25,785
What are you doing?

679
00:49:28,788 --> 00:49:31,207
Sleep here. I will sleep there.

680
00:49:32,125 --> 00:49:33,501
Then you will be cold.

681
00:49:34,294 --> 00:49:35,461
I was fine

682
00:49:35,545 --> 00:49:37,714
when I slept in a hole
during the winter training.

683
00:49:38,089 --> 00:49:39,716
Coldness doesn't bother me.

684
00:49:39,799 --> 00:49:42,677
The situation is completely different now.
You are a patient.

685
00:49:46,431 --> 00:49:48,933
Are you suggesting
that we use the same bed?

686
00:49:49,017 --> 00:49:50,268
Don't feel uncomfortable.

687
00:49:50,351 --> 00:49:51,311
This is my bed.

688
00:49:51,394 --> 00:49:53,271
As I always say,

689
00:49:53,354 --> 00:49:56,316
there is no need for a war
if we stay within our boundaries.

690
00:49:59,235 --> 00:50:00,486
That's what I wanted to say.

691
00:50:26,387 --> 00:50:27,221
Are you asleep?

692
00:50:33,227 --> 00:50:34,354
Already?

693
00:50:39,275 --> 00:50:41,235
How could you fall asleep
in this situation?

694
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:28,593
The name is Ri Jeong Hyeok.
Is there such a patient?

695
00:52:28,676 --> 00:52:30,136
Are you sure he has a gunshot wound?

696
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:33,431
-People's Hospital of Sariwon?
-Yes, sir.

697
00:52:33,681 --> 00:52:37,018
Only the First Lieutenant's name
was recorded, so it took us a while.

698
00:52:41,898 --> 00:52:43,608
Contact the hospital.

699
00:52:43,941 --> 00:52:46,444
-Tell them to keep an eye on him.
-Yes, sir.

700
00:53:09,926 --> 00:53:11,302
GU SEUNG-JUN

701
00:53:35,076 --> 00:53:36,202
Hello.

702
00:53:36,327 --> 00:53:37,495
<i>Seung-jun.</i>

703
00:53:38,830 --> 00:53:40,039
Yoon Se-ri?

704
00:53:40,123 --> 00:53:43,501
I contacted Mr. Ri so many times.

705
00:53:43,584 --> 00:53:44,585
Are you

706
00:53:45,419 --> 00:53:46,254
okay?

707
00:53:46,337 --> 00:53:49,215
I asked you for a favor the last time.

708
00:53:49,298 --> 00:53:51,634
I asked you to give my regards
to my father.

709
00:53:51,717 --> 00:53:53,010
How did that go?

710
00:53:53,469 --> 00:53:54,345
Did you do it?

711
00:53:54,428 --> 00:53:57,056
That was why I contacted Mr. Ri.

712
00:53:57,265 --> 00:53:59,642
Let's talk in person.

713
00:53:59,725 --> 00:54:01,727
Where are you? I will go to you.

714
00:54:02,311 --> 00:54:03,187
Okay.

715
00:54:31,507 --> 00:54:33,801
There you are, Captain Ri.

716
00:54:35,136 --> 00:54:37,763
We searched for you everywhere.

717
00:54:37,847 --> 00:54:39,974
I was so preoccupied with surgery

718
00:54:40,057 --> 00:54:41,601
that I reported to the base belatedly.

719
00:54:41,684 --> 00:54:45,605
That's right. We didn't get ahold
of your whereabouts until now

720
00:54:45,688 --> 00:54:47,315
because of that.

721
00:54:48,274 --> 00:54:49,483
Give it to me.

722
00:54:51,527 --> 00:54:52,778
Get out.

723
00:54:56,365 --> 00:54:57,700
FIREARMS LOGBOOK

724
00:54:58,034 --> 00:55:00,411
It's the Records of Firearms
of the fifth company.

725
00:55:00,661 --> 00:55:02,997
That's your signature, right?

726
00:55:04,290 --> 00:55:06,709
-Yes.
-You took out

727
00:55:07,293 --> 00:55:09,045
a nine-millimeter semi-automatic,

728
00:55:09,128 --> 00:55:11,839
enough ammunition for a battle,
and a grenade launcher.

729
00:55:12,131 --> 00:55:14,425
Were you preparing for a war?

730
00:55:14,508 --> 00:55:16,636
The same kind of ammunition

731
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:19,764
as the one you took out was used to attack

732
00:55:19,847 --> 00:55:22,016
the soldiers of the Engineer Brigade
near Sariwon.

733
00:55:22,516 --> 00:55:23,851
What do you think that means?

734
00:55:24,435 --> 00:55:25,811
It means I fired the shots.

735
00:55:30,233 --> 00:55:33,903
Are you saying you shot
the soldiers of the Engineer Brigade

736
00:55:34,487 --> 00:55:38,199
to protect a South Korean spy?

737
00:55:38,282 --> 00:55:39,909
She isn't a spy.

738
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:42,995
To protect my woman,

739
00:55:43,996 --> 00:55:47,250
I shot people who purposefully tried
to cause a car accident.

740
00:55:48,084 --> 00:55:49,168
"Purposefully"?

741
00:55:50,127 --> 00:55:51,295
How are you so certain?

742
00:55:52,004 --> 00:55:53,214
Do you have any grounds?

743
00:55:54,465 --> 00:55:57,969
On what grounds are you so certain
that she is a spy?

744
00:55:58,552 --> 00:56:00,471
-That's--
-Chief Three of United Front Department

745
00:56:00,554 --> 00:56:02,056
told you that, right?

746
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:06,978
Jeong Hyeok, it's about
what you asked me a few days ago.

747
00:56:07,061 --> 00:56:10,273
Apparently, Mr. Choi introduced
Lieutenant Commander Cho Cheol Gang

748
00:56:10,356 --> 00:56:13,567
to Chief Three
of the United Front Department.

749
00:56:14,151 --> 00:56:17,071
He asked for information on Division 11.

750
00:56:17,154 --> 00:56:18,906
Is everything okay with you?

751
00:56:18,990 --> 00:56:21,659
According to Article Three, Clause Two

752
00:56:22,118 --> 00:56:25,705
of the management regulations
regarding undercover agents,

753
00:56:26,163 --> 00:56:29,083
a proposal must be submitted
in order to receive personal information

754
00:56:29,166 --> 00:56:30,918
regarding the special agents

755
00:56:32,211 --> 00:56:33,337
of Division 11.

756
00:56:34,505 --> 00:56:35,798
Did you do that?

757
00:56:35,881 --> 00:56:38,134
Would it be okay if I request
an investigation?

758
00:56:41,345 --> 00:56:42,722
Comrade Ri Jeong Hyeok.

759
00:56:43,931 --> 00:56:46,726
It seems like you have a lot to say.

760
00:56:47,310 --> 00:56:51,147
Let's see if you can run your mouth
at the State Security Department.

761
00:56:51,230 --> 00:56:52,481
First Lieutenant.

762
00:56:54,483 --> 00:56:56,319
Arrest Ri Jeong Hyeok.

763
00:56:56,819 --> 00:57:00,072
Is the matter so pressing that you must
drag away a patient with a gunshot wound?

764
00:57:05,536 --> 00:57:07,079
I can't believe this is happening!

765
00:57:07,371 --> 00:57:09,332
First, the State Security Department.

766
00:57:09,832 --> 00:57:11,917
Now, Director
of the General Political Bureau.

767
00:57:12,001 --> 00:57:14,754
This is an interesting way
to start the day.

768
00:57:14,837 --> 00:57:16,672
There is a rumor that the director's son

769
00:57:16,756 --> 00:57:18,424
is in this hospital.

770
00:57:18,507 --> 00:57:19,675
I heard the rumor, too.

771
00:57:19,967 --> 00:57:21,844
It's the patient with a gunshot wound.

772
00:57:21,927 --> 00:57:23,137
The tall and handsome one?

773
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:26,640
He is the son of the Director
of the General Political Bureau.

774
00:57:27,725 --> 00:57:28,893
You wait and see.

775
00:57:29,185 --> 00:57:31,854
I will marry into the family

776
00:57:31,937 --> 00:57:34,231
and bring about the dazzling revival

777
00:57:34,315 --> 00:57:36,609
of the economy of this hospital.

778
00:57:36,692 --> 00:57:39,028
I think he has a girlfriend.

779
00:57:39,111 --> 00:57:42,448
You can seduce a man with a girlfriend!

780
00:57:42,531 --> 00:57:43,699
You can't.

781
00:57:43,783 --> 00:57:47,036
Dan, what was the room number?

782
00:57:59,090 --> 00:58:00,800
What are you doing? Who are you?

783
00:58:01,801 --> 00:58:02,885
Who are you?

784
00:58:02,968 --> 00:58:03,803
BTS.

785
00:58:05,429 --> 00:58:07,640
I saw you watch a BTS music video.

786
00:58:10,184 --> 00:58:12,561
-I am sorry.
-It's okay. I am sorry.

787
00:58:12,686 --> 00:58:14,146
Let's just go quietly, okay?

788
00:58:16,607 --> 00:58:18,859
You asked me to get the person
you recommended on the plane

789
00:58:18,943 --> 00:58:20,486
as a member of the national team.

790
00:58:20,569 --> 00:58:23,864
Why does the State Security Department
want to arrest you?

791
00:58:24,448 --> 00:58:25,533
Honey.

792
00:58:26,617 --> 00:58:28,035
Answer me right this instant!

793
00:58:29,829 --> 00:58:32,206
Please calm down. Let's ask him later.

794
00:58:32,289 --> 00:58:33,707
Stay out of this!

795
00:58:36,252 --> 00:58:38,421
What kind of trouble are you scheming?

796
00:58:38,838 --> 00:58:40,339
If you make a wrong move,

797
00:58:40,423 --> 00:58:43,300
so many people will use it against me
and take me down.

798
00:58:44,677 --> 00:58:46,137
Despite being my one remaining son--

799
00:58:46,220 --> 00:58:48,764
Don't tell me
to stay out of my own son's business!

800
00:58:49,348 --> 00:58:50,433
He got shot.

801
00:58:50,808 --> 00:58:52,309
He almost died.

802
00:58:52,393 --> 00:58:54,145
He is our one remaining son.

803
00:58:55,229 --> 00:58:56,939
We should be thankful

804
00:58:57,022 --> 00:58:59,150
that he called us to a hospital,
not a funeral house.

805
00:58:59,233 --> 00:59:01,402
We should be proud that he is alive!

806
00:59:02,862 --> 00:59:06,615
You should ask him if he is hurt
and console him.

807
00:59:06,699 --> 00:59:08,534
Why do you keep cornering him?

808
00:59:09,118 --> 00:59:11,829
You should side with him,
not the State Security Department.

809
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,168
Jeong Hyeok!

810
00:59:17,918 --> 00:59:20,171
My goodness, Jeong Hyeok!

811
00:59:20,254 --> 00:59:22,339
Let me get a good look at you.

812
00:59:28,637 --> 00:59:31,015
Your limbs are intact.

813
00:59:32,057 --> 00:59:34,935
How did this nonsense happen?

814
00:59:35,019 --> 00:59:36,270
How did he get shot?

815
00:59:36,770 --> 00:59:40,774
I don't know
if he should continue being a soldier.

816
00:59:41,025 --> 00:59:44,320
Mom, whatever you want to say,
I don't think--

817
00:59:44,403 --> 00:59:46,780
Before something worse happens,

818
00:59:47,573 --> 00:59:49,992
he should change his job.

819
00:59:50,493 --> 00:59:54,830
There shouldn't be another widow
in my household besides me.

820
00:59:55,581 --> 00:59:58,542
Wasn't Jeong Hyeok pursuing the arts?

821
00:59:58,626 --> 01:00:03,339
Thanks to his mother who was an actress,
he has good looks.

822
01:00:03,422 --> 01:00:05,299
He was born with artistic skills.

823
01:00:05,382 --> 01:00:07,301
Because of that,

824
01:00:07,384 --> 01:00:10,262
I wanted my daughter to marry
the second son, not the first son.

825
01:00:10,346 --> 01:00:11,889
Mom, please!

826
01:00:14,141 --> 01:00:15,100
I apologize.

827
01:00:15,684 --> 01:00:17,645
Mother is this way because she is shocked.

828
01:00:17,728 --> 01:00:18,604
That's right.

829
01:00:19,188 --> 01:00:21,065
I was shocked beyond belief.

830
01:00:21,690 --> 01:00:23,734
I did a disservice to everyone.

831
01:00:24,318 --> 01:00:25,486
I apologize.

832
01:00:26,070 --> 01:00:27,780
As you can see, the surgery went well.

833
01:00:28,030 --> 01:00:29,448
I simply need to recover.

834
01:00:29,907 --> 01:00:30,991
Please don't worry.

835
01:00:48,342 --> 01:00:49,426
Let's go.

836
01:00:50,261 --> 01:00:53,556
PEOPLE'S HOSPITAL OF SARIWON

837
01:01:06,443 --> 01:01:08,279
Thank you. You can sit down.

838
01:01:08,362 --> 01:01:11,115
By the way, how are you so good
with the Seoul accent?

839
01:01:12,157 --> 01:01:14,368
I watch the dramas and copy the accent,

840
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:17,037
-but it's hard.
-I picked it up

841
01:01:17,121 --> 01:01:18,789
because I heard and used it a lot.

842
01:01:18,872 --> 01:01:19,832
I see.

843
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:21,792
Sticking to the basics is the key.

844
01:01:23,043 --> 01:01:26,964
I am the biggest ARMY of Pyongyang,
Hyun Min Ji.

845
01:01:27,756 --> 01:01:29,133
It's nice to meet you.

846
01:01:30,593 --> 01:01:32,720
Who is your favorite member?

847
01:01:33,512 --> 01:01:35,180
-What?
-For me, it's Jungkook.

848
01:01:35,306 --> 01:01:36,181
He is so charming!

849
01:01:36,765 --> 01:01:38,726
How about you?
Who is your favorite member?

850
01:01:39,310 --> 01:01:40,436
For me,

851
01:01:42,229 --> 01:01:43,105
it's Ri Jeong Hyeok.

852
01:01:43,689 --> 01:01:44,773
What?

853
01:01:45,065 --> 01:01:46,817
He is so charming.

854
01:01:47,401 --> 01:01:48,319
He is my favorite.

855
01:01:54,158 --> 01:01:55,159
Bye.

856
01:02:00,748 --> 01:02:01,582
Bye.

857
01:02:08,672 --> 01:02:09,965
She's so cool.

858
01:02:16,513 --> 01:02:19,350
I guess someone's been looking after you.

859
01:02:20,768 --> 01:02:21,685
Who is it?

860
01:02:26,106 --> 01:02:28,108
It's the person you're thinking of.

861
01:02:28,734 --> 01:02:30,819
You said she's your partner
in your operation.

862
01:02:31,362 --> 01:02:32,905
Is she your caregiver too?

863
01:02:35,115 --> 01:02:36,492
Dan.

864
01:02:37,201 --> 01:02:38,952
There's something I must tell you.

865
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:42,289
I never intended to fool you,

866
01:02:44,124 --> 01:02:45,626
but things ended up happening that way.

867
01:02:46,043 --> 01:02:47,252
What do you mean?

868
01:02:54,218 --> 01:02:55,552
You see,

869
01:02:57,805 --> 01:02:58,931
I like that woman.

870
01:03:01,266 --> 01:03:02,309
I have feelings for her.

871
01:03:04,019 --> 01:03:05,521
You think you fooled me?

872
01:03:06,939 --> 01:03:10,609
No. I didn't fall for your lie,
so you can't say you fooled me.

873
01:03:10,776 --> 01:03:11,944
I was never fooled by you.

874
01:03:12,611 --> 01:03:15,322
I thought I could marry you
even if I had no feelings for you,

875
01:03:17,241 --> 01:03:19,243
but I don't think we can get married

876
01:03:19,827 --> 01:03:21,620
if I have feelings for someone else.

877
01:03:24,248 --> 01:03:26,375
I heard she's going to leave soon.

878
01:03:28,085 --> 01:03:28,919
Is it not true?

879
01:03:30,003 --> 01:03:32,172
-It is true.
-That's the reason.

880
01:03:32,923 --> 01:03:34,007
Don't you see it?

881
01:03:34,758 --> 01:03:37,219
You're sad because she's leaving soon.

882
01:03:37,302 --> 01:03:39,346
You're afraid you may never see her again.

883
01:03:39,555 --> 01:03:41,265
That's why your heart is fluttering.

884
01:03:41,515 --> 01:03:43,767
You're deluding yourself
into thinking that is love.

885
01:03:44,893 --> 01:03:45,936
I'm not deluding myself--

886
01:03:46,019 --> 01:03:48,105
Our wedding date is set,
so you don't feel thrilled.

887
01:03:48,689 --> 01:03:50,107
I don't make your heart flutter.

888
01:03:50,607 --> 01:03:52,693
This is what happens
with arranged marriages.

889
01:03:53,861 --> 01:03:55,863
Dan, what are you talking about?

890
01:03:55,946 --> 01:03:56,989
Anyway...

891
01:03:58,031 --> 01:04:00,576
As for our wedding, nothing will change.

892
01:04:02,119 --> 01:04:03,996
You have feelings for her?

893
01:04:05,247 --> 01:04:06,331
Sure, go ahead and like her.

894
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:08,625
When she leaves, those "feelings"

895
01:04:09,418 --> 01:04:10,669
will all be gone.

896
01:04:28,437 --> 01:04:30,147
Those stupid feelings will all be gone.

897
01:04:34,818 --> 01:04:38,071
You're already done?
You can stay longer and chat more.

898
01:04:38,614 --> 01:04:41,408
Mom, my wedding dress.

899
01:04:41,492 --> 01:04:42,367
What?

900
01:04:43,952 --> 01:04:45,537
Let's go and get my wedding dress.

901
01:04:46,121 --> 01:04:47,498
We should get ready for my wedding.

902
01:04:47,581 --> 01:04:48,499
Right, let's go.

903
01:04:53,670 --> 01:04:54,797
Thank you.

904
01:04:55,255 --> 01:04:58,467
I couldn't really stay there.

905
01:04:58,717 --> 01:04:59,885
Why not?

906
01:05:00,677 --> 01:05:01,595
Well...

907
01:05:02,471 --> 01:05:04,139
I had a bit of a situation.

908
01:05:04,973 --> 01:05:07,684
By the way, where are we going?

909
01:05:08,685 --> 01:05:12,105
Oh, it's where I usually stay
when I'm here.

910
01:05:12,189 --> 01:05:15,692
I figured you probably haven't eaten
or even had a chance to wash up.

911
01:05:15,776 --> 01:05:18,070
You can eat some good food and rest up.

912
01:05:18,654 --> 01:05:20,823
-What kind of place is this?
-You'll see.

913
01:05:26,119 --> 01:05:28,455
My gosh, what is this fancy mansion?

914
01:05:29,456 --> 01:05:30,332
What?

915
01:05:30,749 --> 01:05:32,376
You're Chairman Yoon's only daughter.

916
01:05:32,459 --> 01:05:33,669
You're impressed by this?

917
01:05:33,752 --> 01:05:35,003
First, tell me.

918
01:05:35,504 --> 01:05:36,713
Did you contact my family?

919
01:05:36,797 --> 01:05:38,298
Have a seat first.

920
01:05:41,635 --> 01:05:44,304
-Did you contact them?
-We can't call a Korean number from here.

921
01:05:44,888 --> 01:05:46,598
But it seemed urgent,

922
01:05:46,682 --> 01:05:49,142
so I contacted them through my friend
who's abroad.

923
01:05:49,768 --> 01:05:51,645
-And?
-What do you think?

924
01:05:51,728 --> 01:05:53,730
They're over the moon happy
that you're alive.

925
01:05:53,814 --> 01:05:56,567
Really? Who? My mom? My dad?

926
01:05:56,650 --> 01:05:58,527
All of them, I heard.

927
01:05:58,652 --> 01:06:01,905
Everyone from your parents to brothers
are so happy.

928
01:06:03,156 --> 01:06:04,366
You're lying.

929
01:06:04,449 --> 01:06:06,410
-What?
-There's no way Se-jun and Se-hyeong

930
01:06:06,493 --> 01:06:08,078
were happy to hear that I'm alive.

931
01:06:08,871 --> 01:06:11,415
Even if you guys fight all the time,
a family is still a family.

932
01:06:12,332 --> 01:06:14,751
They still care more about you
than a complete stranger would.

933
01:06:14,835 --> 01:06:16,587
I heard you had been missing

934
01:06:16,670 --> 01:06:18,088
since the paragliding accident.

935
01:06:18,171 --> 01:06:20,257
So you actually managed
to get in touch with my family.

936
01:06:20,340 --> 01:06:21,884
Yes, I told you.

937
01:06:21,967 --> 01:06:23,802
So you landed here after the accident?

938
01:06:24,094 --> 01:06:25,554
That's insane.

939
01:06:26,847 --> 01:06:28,515
The weather was crazy that day.

940
01:06:29,016 --> 01:06:31,101
And I found out later that the radars

941
01:06:31,184 --> 01:06:33,645
can't detect paragliders
because they're not engine-powered.

942
01:06:33,729 --> 01:06:35,147
It was the worst-case scenario.

943
01:06:35,230 --> 01:06:37,900
That's why they couldn't find you
no matter how hard they looked.

944
01:06:38,275 --> 01:06:41,695
I heard your brothers even hired
private agencies to find you.

945
01:06:41,904 --> 01:06:45,365
They said you can put your worries to rest
now that they know you're alive.

946
01:06:46,366 --> 01:06:48,911
They said you mustn't do anything reckless
to go back soon.

947
01:06:48,994 --> 01:06:50,996
There's a lot going on politically,

948
01:06:51,079 --> 01:06:53,790
and you're like a celebrity, you know.

949
01:06:54,875 --> 01:06:55,834
They said

950
01:06:56,418 --> 01:06:58,629
they'll secretly look for a way
you can return safely.

951
01:07:00,088 --> 01:07:03,175
Right, they're even postponing
the general shareholder meeting

952
01:07:03,467 --> 01:07:04,927
as it would be pointless without you.

953
01:07:05,427 --> 01:07:07,012
THE 36TH GENERAL SHAREHOLDER MEETING

954
01:07:41,755 --> 01:07:43,298
THE 36TH GENERAL SHAREHOLDER MEETING

955
01:07:43,382 --> 01:07:44,883
Before we begin,

956
01:07:45,634 --> 01:07:50,472
I'd like to clarify a few things
regarding the rumors about my family

957
01:07:51,056 --> 01:07:53,684
that have been spreading

958
01:07:54,351 --> 01:07:57,312
in the stock market recently.

959
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,273
Yoon Se-ri,

960
01:08:00,774 --> 01:08:03,151
the CEO of Se-ri's Choice
who is also my daughter,

961
01:08:04,528 --> 01:08:07,572
has been missing
since an unfortunate accident.

962
01:08:08,448 --> 01:08:12,536
We searched for her for a month
while keeping it confidential

963
01:08:13,203 --> 01:08:16,331
but could not find her.

964
01:08:20,252 --> 01:08:23,714
Hence, according to Article 90
of the Family Registration Law

965
01:08:23,797 --> 01:08:26,717
and following the guidelines
for certifying deaths...

966
01:08:36,101 --> 01:08:41,314
We have completed registering her death.

967
01:08:49,239 --> 01:08:50,866
THE 36TH GENERAL SHAREHOLDER MEETING

968
01:08:50,949 --> 01:08:53,243
Did you see this?
Apparently, Yoon Se-ri is dead.

969
01:08:53,326 --> 01:08:55,078
Isn't she Cha Sang-u's ex-girlfriend?

970
01:08:55,162 --> 01:08:57,205
-Yes, she is.
-She's dead?

971
01:08:58,915 --> 01:09:00,167
Hey, Chang-sik.

972
01:09:07,299 --> 01:09:09,176
YOON SE-RI'S DEATH
REGISTERED BY HER FAMILY

973
01:09:10,093 --> 01:09:11,219
<i>Hello?</i>

974
01:09:11,303 --> 01:09:12,137
Su-chan.

975
01:09:13,305 --> 01:09:14,347
Did you faint?

976
01:09:14,431 --> 01:09:16,600
THE 36TH GENERAL SHAREHOLDER MEETING

977
01:09:16,683 --> 01:09:18,018
Gosh, I'm worried sick.

978
01:09:18,226 --> 01:09:20,645
Out of all 94,823,847 stocks

979
01:09:20,729 --> 01:09:24,816
with voting rights,

980
01:09:25,192 --> 01:09:26,860
a total of 5,798 shareholders,

981
01:09:26,943 --> 01:09:29,404
including those
who signed a power of attorney,

982
01:09:29,738 --> 01:09:34,785
have exercised their voting rights
representing 70,040,947 stocks.

983
01:09:36,286 --> 01:09:40,207
Over two-thirds of the shareholders
attending this meeting have voted

984
01:09:45,212 --> 01:09:48,048
in favor of Mr. Yoon Se-hyeong
taking over the management rights.

985
01:10:35,428 --> 01:10:38,849
Gosh, is this really necessary?

986
01:10:38,932 --> 01:10:42,352
I'll be sent to the concentration camp
if I get caught selling wedding dresses.

987
01:10:42,435 --> 01:10:44,271
Please understand.

988
01:10:45,814 --> 01:10:49,442
Dan, you've gotten even prettier
after living abroad for a few years.

989
01:10:50,193 --> 01:10:51,236
Have a seat.

990
01:10:55,657 --> 01:10:58,451
So you got back from Shanghai today.

991
01:10:58,618 --> 01:11:00,078
I'm sure you brought something new.

992
01:11:00,162 --> 01:11:04,082
I obviously didn't go all the way there
just to eat some <i>xiaolongbao</i>.

993
01:11:08,879 --> 01:11:11,464
I brought this wedding magazine
from the South. It's a new edition.

994
01:11:12,048 --> 01:11:14,467
My gosh! A new edition, indeed.

995
01:11:14,968 --> 01:11:18,597
I was so scared of getting caught
while smuggling this in.

996
01:11:19,181 --> 01:11:21,725
Look through this
and pick something gorgeous.

997
01:11:23,101 --> 01:11:26,938
Dan has fair skin and a sharp jawline,

998
01:11:27,522 --> 01:11:30,775
so something with a boat neck
and a dramatic, full skirt

999
01:11:30,859 --> 01:11:32,652
will look amazing on her.

1000
01:11:33,278 --> 01:11:35,155
Will you be okay with a full skirt?

1001
01:11:35,447 --> 01:11:38,825
She has lost quite a bit of weight.

1002
01:11:38,909 --> 01:11:41,745
Just look at her.
Any dress would look amazing on her.

1003
01:11:41,828 --> 01:11:43,163
She's lost too much weight.

1004
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:51,838
YOON SE-RI HASN'T BEEN SEEN IN PUBLIC

1005
01:11:51,922 --> 01:11:54,257
So? Is there anything you like?

1006
01:11:56,468 --> 01:11:57,928
MISSING SINCE PARAGLIDING ACCIDENT

1007
01:11:58,011 --> 01:12:02,140
Hey, I told you to pick out a dress.
Why are you looking at this?

1008
01:12:03,016 --> 01:12:04,226
Mom.

1009
01:12:04,893 --> 01:12:06,645
I have to go somewhere.

1010
01:12:06,728 --> 01:12:08,188
Where?

1011
01:12:08,980 --> 01:12:11,733
-Open the door for me, please.
-You can't take that. Give it back!

1012
01:12:11,816 --> 01:12:13,276
Let me out at once!

1013
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:15,153
YOON SE-RI HASN'T BEEN SEEN IN PUBLIC

1014
01:12:23,161 --> 01:12:25,288
-You didn't find her?
-No, I didn't see her anywhere.

1015
01:12:29,918 --> 01:12:32,170
Oh, dear. Had I known,

1016
01:12:32,254 --> 01:12:34,839
I wouldn't have gone
to Masikryong Ski Resort.

1017
01:12:35,215 --> 01:12:38,802
I missed the opportunity to meet the
Director of the General Political Bureau.

1018
01:12:38,927 --> 01:12:42,639
Still, his son
is asking for our help, you know.

1019
01:12:42,722 --> 01:12:44,057
Yes, you're right.

1020
01:12:45,267 --> 01:12:48,228
I've been told that I will turn
my life around at the age of 55.

1021
01:12:49,229 --> 01:12:51,356
You said he's asking to see
the security footage, right?

1022
01:12:51,940 --> 01:12:55,694
You can just call us over
if you need anything.

1023
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:57,570
We would've made a copy

1024
01:12:58,071 --> 01:13:01,032
so that you could comfortably
watch the footage in your bed.

1025
01:13:01,116 --> 01:13:02,158
It's okay.

1026
01:13:02,575 --> 01:13:04,202
Thank you for your help.

1027
01:13:04,286 --> 01:13:07,163
You must be busy.
You can all go back to work.

1028
01:13:08,248 --> 01:13:09,749
Are any of you busy at the moment?

1029
01:13:11,501 --> 01:13:12,919
We have a lot of time to spare.

1030
01:13:13,003 --> 01:13:15,588
We have nothing better to do,
so please keep looking.

1031
01:13:19,467 --> 01:13:20,302
There.

1032
01:13:25,598 --> 01:13:28,018
What is it? What's the matter?

1033
01:13:34,232 --> 01:13:35,900
May I use your phone?

1034
01:13:35,984 --> 01:13:38,611
Gosh, you don't even need to ask.

1035
01:13:38,695 --> 01:13:42,073
Feel free to use everything
at the hospital as if it's yours.

1036
01:13:42,824 --> 01:13:44,492
Did you look up the license plate number?

1037
01:13:45,201 --> 01:13:48,788
Yes. The vehicle does belong
to the Ministry of People’s Security,

1038
01:13:48,872 --> 01:13:50,206
but it's fake.

1039
01:13:50,582 --> 01:13:52,375
-You mean, the number is fake?
-<i>Yes.</i>

1040
01:13:52,459 --> 01:13:54,085
I looked further into it,
and it looks like

1041
01:13:54,461 --> 01:13:57,964
the State Security Department
uses the vehicle.

1042
01:13:58,214 --> 01:14:00,884
<i>Apparently, it was used
for a long-term event at the guest lodge.</i>

1043
01:14:01,384 --> 01:14:04,137
But from what I know,
the guest lodge was shut down a while ago.

1044
01:14:04,679 --> 01:14:05,847
I wonder what's going on.

1045
01:14:05,930 --> 01:14:07,390
Where is the guest lodge?

1046
01:14:07,474 --> 01:14:08,975
<i>On the map, it's showing</i>

1047
01:14:09,059 --> 01:14:12,604
<i>in Bongdeok-dong in Kaesong.
The coordinates are 35, 129.</i>

1048
01:14:12,687 --> 01:14:14,981
<i>It won't be easy to find it though.</i>

1049
01:14:28,828 --> 01:14:29,788
Hey.

1050
01:14:30,163 --> 01:14:31,623
Why didn't you wake me up?

1051
01:14:31,956 --> 01:14:33,333
Because you seemed exhausted.

1052
01:14:34,292 --> 01:14:35,377
Can I use your phone?

1053
01:14:38,713 --> 01:14:40,340
Have a seat. The food is ready. Let's eat.

1054
01:14:40,423 --> 01:14:41,925
Let me make a call first.

1055
01:14:42,008 --> 01:14:43,218
A call? Why?

1056
01:14:43,301 --> 01:14:45,845
I left without even telling him.
He must be waiting for me.

1057
01:14:45,929 --> 01:14:47,013
Who?

1058
01:14:47,097 --> 01:14:48,431
That bodyguard?

1059
01:14:49,224 --> 01:14:50,100
Yes.

1060
01:14:51,226 --> 01:14:52,852
But you don't need him anymore.

1061
01:14:54,729 --> 01:14:55,855
What?

1062
01:14:57,899 --> 01:15:00,360
I said, you don't need him anymore.

1063
01:15:19,963 --> 01:15:21,214
Is it Yoon Se-ri?

1064
01:15:21,714 --> 01:15:22,799
Her name.

1065
01:15:27,429 --> 01:15:28,638
You have me now.

1066
01:15:29,806 --> 01:15:31,891
You can stay here with me and go home.

1067
01:15:32,642 --> 01:15:34,352
Why do you want to spend time with him?

1068
01:15:34,853 --> 01:15:37,647
You said you couldn't be there.
That's why you escaped.

1069
01:15:39,649 --> 01:15:41,067
The situation earlier today...

1070
01:15:42,694 --> 01:15:44,154
Wasn't it dangerous for him as well,

1071
01:15:44,612 --> 01:15:46,364
not just for you?

1072
01:15:47,282 --> 01:15:49,742
Let's be honest. You can just leave.

1073
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:51,411
But what about him?

1074
01:15:52,579 --> 01:15:54,581
He has to live here
for the rest of his life.

1075
01:15:55,665 --> 01:15:57,542
Don't you think you're being cruel to him?

1076
01:16:01,129 --> 01:16:02,881
You see,

1077
01:16:04,466 --> 01:16:06,009
he might die because of you.

1078
01:16:12,599 --> 01:16:14,517
Can you explain this?

1079
01:16:19,189 --> 01:16:21,900
YOON SE-RI HASN'T BEEN SEEN IN PUBLIC

1080
01:16:21,983 --> 01:16:23,610
So this is her?

1081
01:16:24,694 --> 01:16:26,613
The woman you like.

1082
01:16:29,949 --> 01:16:30,909
Answer me.

1083
01:16:32,494 --> 01:16:34,037
Did you know

1084
01:16:34,287 --> 01:16:35,788
who she really is?

1085
01:16:37,081 --> 01:16:38,124
Yes, I did.

1086
01:16:38,208 --> 01:16:41,044
What the heck is a South Korean woman
doing here?

1087
01:16:41,127 --> 01:16:42,754
She ended up here due to an accident,

1088
01:16:43,796 --> 01:16:44,923
and we met by chance.

1089
01:16:48,384 --> 01:16:51,137
-She'll go back soon.
-So you're helping her hide?

1090
01:16:51,721 --> 01:16:52,764
That's right.

1091
01:16:53,348 --> 01:16:56,684
If you get caught,
you might lose everything you have.

1092
01:16:58,228 --> 01:16:59,145
What I'm saying is,

1093
01:17:00,563 --> 01:17:02,315
she could get you killed.

1094
01:17:02,899 --> 01:17:04,234
And you still

1095
01:17:05,068 --> 01:17:06,528
like her?

1096
01:17:25,046 --> 01:17:26,422
100 PERCENT PURE CARBONIC ACID

1097
01:17:27,298 --> 01:17:28,758
THIS IS THE TASTE OF TRUE BEER

1098
01:17:28,841 --> 01:17:29,884
WELL-MADE BEER

1099
01:17:57,245 --> 01:17:59,414
You studied classical music
back in school, right?

1100
01:18:00,540 --> 01:18:01,583
Do you know this song?

1101
01:18:30,862 --> 01:18:31,779
What is this song?

1102
01:18:33,781 --> 01:18:34,907
I don't know.

1103
01:18:35,575 --> 01:18:38,036
I just happened to hear it somewhere
a long time ago,

1104
01:18:38,119 --> 01:18:39,954
but I have no idea whose song it is.

1105
01:18:40,038 --> 01:18:42,206
I looked up all the songs I could think of

1106
01:18:43,291 --> 01:18:45,960
and asked my acquaintances
that know a lot about music,

1107
01:18:46,085 --> 01:18:47,378
but no one knows what song it is.

1108
01:18:49,631 --> 01:18:50,840
Play it again.

1109
01:19:18,159 --> 01:19:19,369
I have no clue.

1110
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:25,875
I really want to hear it one more time,

1111
01:19:26,626 --> 01:19:28,127
but no one recognizes the melody.

1112
01:19:28,711 --> 01:19:30,254
Where did you hear it?

1113
01:19:31,964 --> 01:19:33,383
A few years ago,

1114
01:19:34,467 --> 01:19:36,386
I went to Switzerland.

1115
01:19:52,902 --> 01:19:53,903
<i>Back then,</i>

1116
01:19:54,487 --> 01:19:56,406
<i>I didn't want to live.</i>

1117
01:19:57,281 --> 01:19:58,366
<i>I thought</i>

1118
01:19:58,866 --> 01:20:01,786
<i>it'd be nice to spend my final moments</i>

1119
01:20:01,911 --> 01:20:03,621
<i>in a place with beautiful scenery.</i>

1120
01:20:04,914 --> 01:20:07,333
<i>But during the trip, I realized </i>

1121
01:20:07,834 --> 01:20:09,794
<i>that I did not want to die.</i>

1122
01:20:09,877 --> 01:20:11,838
<i>I just didn't want to live.</i>

1123
01:20:13,381 --> 01:20:14,507
<i>I just</i>

1124
01:20:15,133 --> 01:20:17,051
<i>needed some consolation.</i>

1125
01:20:17,802 --> 01:20:21,556
<i>I'd never live the kind of life where
I could be loved by those whom I love,</i>

1126
01:20:22,306 --> 01:20:23,683
<i>but I still</i>

1127
01:20:24,058 --> 01:20:25,435
<i>wanted to hear someone say</i>

1128
01:20:25,852 --> 01:20:27,270
<i>that I could live</i>

1129
01:20:27,937 --> 01:20:30,064
<i>and that I must keep on living.</i>

1130
01:20:40,575 --> 01:20:42,201
<i>And right at that moment,</i>

1131
01:20:43,202 --> 01:20:44,787
<i>that melody started playing</i>

1132
01:20:45,204 --> 01:20:46,873
<i>as if it was the answer to my prayer.</i>

1133
01:20:48,291 --> 01:20:50,209
<i>"You can live.</i>

1134
01:20:50,752 --> 01:20:52,545
<i>You must get through this."</i>

1135
01:20:53,463 --> 01:20:55,423
<i>It gave me solace.</i>

1136
01:21:59,194 --> 01:22:01,491
CRASH LANDING ON YOU

1137
01:22:02,156 --> 01:22:05,785
If you like him,
you should just disappear now.

1138
01:22:06,369 --> 01:22:08,788
They broke off their engagement.
He's not her boyfriend.

1139
01:22:09,372 --> 01:22:11,165
<i>A fake marriage with you?</i>

1140
01:22:11,249 --> 01:22:15,378
<i>I, too, will do anything
to protect my fiancé.</i>

1141
01:22:15,461 --> 01:22:19,674
<i>Bring that South Korean woman to me
at once.</i>

1142
01:22:20,258 --> 01:22:22,593
<i>I came for you.
I figured you'd be waiting for me.</i>

1143
01:22:22,802 --> 01:22:24,720
<i>Your safe return to Korea means</i>

1144
01:22:24,804 --> 01:22:27,306
that Ri Jeong Hyeok's safety
won't be guaranteed.

1145
