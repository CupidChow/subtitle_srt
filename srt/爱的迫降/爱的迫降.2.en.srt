00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,971
ALL CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND BACKGROUND ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,515
1989

3
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,809
Se-ri, choose

4
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:00,435
-your dream!
-Your dream!

5
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:02,771
Se-ri, grab the flower!

6
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:04,231
Grab the flower!

7
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:07,484
<i>That day, I made a choice</i>
<i>for the first time.</i>

8
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,405
<i>When others grabbed money or strings,</i>

9
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:12,531
<i>I grabbed</i>

10
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:15,742
<i>my dad's hand.</i>

11
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:18,787
That's right! Grabbing your daddy's hand
is the best thing to do!

12
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:22,332
<i>As a baby who would grow up</i>
<i>to fight over who will be the successor</i>

13
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:26,211
<i>of a huge business conglomerate,</i>
<i>I think it was an excellent choice.</i>

14
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:30,549
SERI'S CHOICE

15
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:34,219
CONTRACT

16
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:43,478
-Congratulations.
-Look here, please.

17
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:45,480
<i>Either when things depended on my luck</i>

18
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:47,899
<i>or depended on my sense,</i>

19
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:50,652
<i>I always made the right choices.</i>

20
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,576
He said I should go right.

21
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:02,539
<i>That's why even at the crisis of my life,</i>
<i>I had never doubted myself.</i>

22
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,542
Let's go.

23
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:06,543
<i>Where are we going</i>

24
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:09,630
<i>I believed I'd be making</i>
<i>the right choice once again.</i>

25
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:12,007
<i>But this time,</i>

26
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:13,800
<i>I was wrong.</i>

27
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,557
<i>Although it was just one mistake,</i>

28
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:23,143
<i>the consequence was immense.</i>

29
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:30,108
<i>Right now,</i>

30
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:32,319
<i>I'm in North Korea.</i>

31
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:38,617
<i>This is an accident.</i>

32
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:41,828
<i>When you're in an accident,</i>
<i>you need someone</i>

33
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,289
<i>on your side.</i>

34
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:48,251
<i>And the only person I know here and now</i>

35
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:49,961
<i>is this man.</i>

36
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,007
<i>I should do well.</i>

37
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:57,344
Oh, my.

38
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,846
My goodness.

39
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:04,601
I can't believe we've met again.

40
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,061
I thought you went back.

41
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:09,523
Exactly. You must be surprised.

42
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,817
I was just as surprised.

43
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,821
I lost my way. When I came to my senses,

44
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:19,408
there was a North Korean cow,
then some North Korean ladies,

45
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:20,992
and North Korean kids.

46
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,705
But I'm so relieved

47
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,791
to meet you once again.

48
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:36,842
<i>I knew it. No matter how tough</i>
<i>you pretend to be, you're just a man.</i>

49
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:42,639
<i>See? He can't even look me in the eye.</i>

50
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:44,725
<i>He's more innocent than I thought.</i>

51
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:49,020
<i>She sneaked over</i>
<i>the Military Demarcation Line</i>

52
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:50,856
<i>without showing an intention to defect.</i>

53
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:53,900
<i>Based on the rules,</i>

54
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:57,571
<i>I must get rid of her.</i>

55
00:03:58,363 --> 00:03:59,364
Well, it seems

56
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:01,491
there's always a way to survive.

57
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:03,243
<i>Should I kill her?</i>

58
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:08,582
By the way, is this your house?

59
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:10,208
Is it really?

60
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,795
Then can I ask you one question?

61
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:16,631
Do you have food?

62
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:18,842
<i>Should I kill her?</i>

63
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,813
EPISODE 2

64
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:35,108
<i>Oh, my.</i>

65
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,110
Oh, my.

66
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:40,405
What's wrong with my face?

67
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:41,531
Come on.

68
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:46,286
He should've told me if I was this dirty.

69
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,748
What is this?
There isn't even a handbasin.

70
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:07,891
No, you're fine.
This is a good experience.

71
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:13,271
They say things you can't buy with money
are the most priceless.

72
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:15,899
This is a priceless experience.

73
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,731
I don't know how you guys do it.

74
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:59,901
But in the South, this is what we do.

75
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:03,405
When you are eating
at someone else's house,

76
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,323
the guest

77
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:08,618
usually offers the first bite to the host.

78
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:09,870
Like this.

79
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:12,205
Open up.

80
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:17,502
We think it's proper
for the owner of the house to eat first.

81
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:19,462
It's a part of table manners.

82
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,756
Perhaps, that'll help you understand.

83
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:26,011
What's wrong?

84
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,721
Are you concerned
about what's in the food?

85
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,222
In case it's poisonous?

86
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:35,478
I'm sorry if I offended you.

87
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:39,232
But do understand
why I'm acting like this.

88
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:41,192
Wouldn't it be more ridiculous

89
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:43,987
for me to trust someone instantly
in this situation?

90
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,032
You are correct.

91
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:49,576
Right? I'm correct, right?

92
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,661
You made an emergency landing at the DMZ,

93
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,830
while flying an unpowered aircraft
on a windy day.

94
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:56,666
Just when the electric wires
weren't operating,

95
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,794
you crossed the ceasefire line
into this military housing area.

96
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:02,422
I'd be absurd to believe
that you're a harmless civilian.

97
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:06,718
Don't tell me that you're suspecting me

98
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:08,929
of being a spy.

99
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:10,764
I'm just talking about the possibilities.

100
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:15,810
Look, here.

101
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,730
I'm not a spy.

102
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:20,815
In fact, I'm so famous down there

103
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,567
that you'd be a spy not to know me.

104
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:24,235
I'm not disclosing my name

105
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,530
because I don't want you
to search me up online and be in shock.

106
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:30,367
We don't have internet, so don't worry.

107
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,827
Are you serious? You have no internet?

108
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:35,163
That makes it even worse.

109
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:37,666
No one knows that
I'm in this off-the-grid village.

110
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:38,959
I'm sure the entire country

111
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:42,087
is stirred by my disappearance.

112
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:50,804
They searched all night,

113
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:53,223
but they haven't found anything.

114
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,392
Let's not rely solely on the police.

115
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,603
We should hire some professionals
and do our own search.

116
00:07:58,687 --> 00:07:59,854
Okay.

117
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:02,607
Make sure word doesn't get out.

118
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,484
Beware of the reporters.

119
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:07,445
That was the first thing I looked into.

120
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:11,157
And my father-in-law helped us big time.

121
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:15,495
My father called
the police commissioner himself.

122
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:16,538
Don't worry.

123
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:19,249
Really? I'm relieved.

124
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:22,794
I heard she was working when it happened.

125
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:27,048
Then her employees who were
on the scene are aware of this.

126
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:28,466
What should we do with them?

127
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,845
I summoned all of them and made them sign

128
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:35,974
the confidential agreement
with the corporation lawyers present.

129
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:39,978
I knew it. You are such a professional.

130
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:42,272
-Don't say that.
-Are you having fun?

131
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:45,275
-Mom.
-How could we?

132
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,694
That's a bit harsh, Mom.

133
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,154
Of course it's not fun, Mother.

134
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,698
You all look like you're having fun.

135
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:55,410
<i>I'm sure everyone is panicking by now.</i>

136
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:57,954
Also,

137
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:01,541
the reason that this is no laughing matter

138
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:06,087
is that this could create
nation-to-nation problems.

139
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:08,673
Do you not get it?

140
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:11,760
I'm talking about
possibilities of war. Hello?

141
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:17,390
Once everyone finds out that I'm here,

142
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:18,892
the South Korean government,

143
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,810
military authorities,

144
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:22,520
and...

145
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,690
even the UN won't stay still.

146
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:30,653
Then I won't let them know.

147
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,407
-What?
-No one should know that you're here.

148
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:38,495
What are you trying to say?

149
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:43,875
Are you saying that you'll get rid of me
before anyone finds out?

150
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,877
That is one of the many options.

151
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:47,462
Is that

152
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,964
supposed to be a North Korean joke?

153
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:53,885
I'm not used to
North Korean jokes yet, you see.

154
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:56,304
That was quite witty, though.

155
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,187
I think

156
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,397
you misunderstood me there.

157
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:10,068
Right. I think my explanation
was too complicated.

158
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,736
I'll give you an example.

159
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:14,572
Do you know Heung-bu and Nol-bu?
Let's say that you do.

160
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:17,784
What happened to Heung-bu after he treated
the swallow's leg?

161
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,661
He hit a jackpot,
went from rags to riches.

162
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:22,372
And what happened to Nol-bu
who tortured the swallow?

163
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,124
His family was ruined.

164
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,251
What are you trying to say?

165
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:27,335
Tell me.

166
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:30,839
Would you rather be Heung-bu or Nol-bu?

167
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:32,882
Are you the swallow?

168
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,050
No.

169
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:35,969
I'm not just any swallow.

170
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,596
I'm a very wealthy swallow
who pays back her debts.

171
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:40,723
You see...

172
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,185
I usually don't say this.

173
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:45,645
Then don't.

174
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:48,523
I come from

175
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:53,653
the 0.001 percent tier in South Korea.

176
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:58,908
From a rich family.

177
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:04,622
My fashion company is listed on KOSDAQ.

178
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:06,040
I'm not interested.

179
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:10,920
This is what I'm trying to say.
Just like how Heung-bu took care of

180
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,131
the swallow until she could fly
back home to Gangnam,

181
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:15,341
I'm asking you to help me.

182
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:17,802
If you do, I'll repay you handsomely.

183
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:20,221
Are you trying to negotiate with me?

184
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:23,391
Yes, yes. That's it.

185
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:24,642
This is a win-win negotiation.

186
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,856
-I refuse.
-Why?

187
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:31,608
I'll repay your kindness.

188
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,111
I won't show you
any kindness to begin with.

189
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:52,462
I didn't know you were home
and went looking everywhere.

190
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,798
I knew you were home when I saw smoke
coming out of your chimney.

191
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:00,929
I have good news.

192
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:07,310
We don't need to worry
about that South Korean woman anymore.

193
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,604
Look. About that woman--

194
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:10,605
She's dead.

195
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:16,319
Aren't you surprised? I was too.

196
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:19,489
This early morning, there was a collision
at Mount Suseok.

197
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,283
An unidentified, young woman died
at the scene.

198
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:23,868
It's obviously her.

199
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:25,787
-That's not--
-Come on.

200
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,248
My hunches are as precise
as those of a fortuneteller's.

201
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:29,832
You just wait and see.

202
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,459
If I'm wrong, you can chop my head off.

203
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:34,462
-You can leave for now--
-I need to pee.

204
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:35,672
I've been holding it in.

205
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:40,134
Anyway, I'm truly relieved.

206
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:44,389
Eun Dong won't have to face
a dishonorable discharge while he's young,

207
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:47,517
and they won't find out that
Ju Meok left his post

208
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,435
to watch that South Korean drama.

209
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,605
I only had a glass of alcohol,
so it's not a big deal.

210
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:56,567
But you failed to catch that woman
who was right before your eyes.

211
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:59,737
That's quite a grave...

212
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:02,323
How do you chop someone's head off?

213
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:04,158
I've never done it before.

214
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:06,077
Is it like this?

215
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:08,162
You startled me.

216
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:11,374
Captain Ri, what is going on here?

217
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,084
It's you, right?

218
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:16,254
You're the one who shot at me.
I almost died thanks to you.

219
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:18,214
I thought she died.

220
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:19,632
What...

221
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:21,426
What happened?

222
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:24,846
I must say, South Korea is quite good.

223
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:27,598
How did they send a spy
right to this location,

224
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:30,059
a North Korean
commissioned officer's house,

225
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,979
without making a single mistake?

226
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:35,064
How many times did I say this?

227
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:38,067
I had no idea this was his house,

228
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,861
I'm not a spy,

229
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:42,780
and I definitely wasn't sent here.

230
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:44,991
Do you usually have trouble understanding

231
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,285
what people say to you
and things like that?

232
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:51,331
Captain, do you have a shovel or a pickax?

233
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:53,708
Spare me some time.

234
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:56,085
We have many rivers and mountains.

235
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:59,589
There are countless places
where we could bury her in our country.

236
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,799
What are you talking about, you sly cat?

237
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:05,303
Bury what? You can bury yourself
if you'd like.

238
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,597
Hey, you South Korean.

239
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:11,934
I know you're stupid, but do you really
not get what's happening here?

240
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,604
We don't show mercy to our enemies.

241
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:20,318
I don't think you get
what's going on here, either.

242
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:23,571
Won't all of you get in huge trouble

243
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,033
if people find out that I'm hiding here?

244
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,827
It won't only be me
getting screwed, right?

245
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:31,704
What was it again?

246
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:34,791
Eun Dong will face
a dishonorable discharge.

247
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:35,958
Ju Meok?

248
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:39,128
He'll be punished for leaving his post
to watch South Korean dramas.

249
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:40,338
As for the captain...

250
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:42,423
You'd be revolutionized.

251
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:44,384
TO BE REMOVED FROM ONE'S POST
TO DO FORCED LABOR

252
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:46,177
And you, sly cat!

253
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,553
Drinking during work hours?

254
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:49,347
You're the worst.

255
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,433
Captain Ri,

256
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:55,311
how does that woman know all that?

257
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,105
What do you think?

258
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:11,202
Hello.

259
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:14,163
Did you hear about the good news?

260
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:15,706
At Mount Suseok, a young woman--

261
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:16,791
That's not true.

262
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:18,876
-An unidentified woman--
-It's not true.

263
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,378
You must be Eun Dong.

264
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:22,588
Sorry? Who are you?

265
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:26,175
I heard you might face
a dishonorable discharge.

266
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,136
That means you'll get kicked out.

267
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,596
I heard you need this job.

268
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:34,684
They said she died.

269
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,394
Exactly.

270
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,355
You're Ju Meok, aren't you?

271
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:41,566
What a combative name, "Fist"?

272
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,651
Well, I guess a soldier
could use such masculinity.

273
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,611
Which South Korean drama

274
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:47,530
were you watching when you left your post?

275
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:49,615
<i>Stairway to Heaven.</i>

276
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:51,325
That's an old one.

277
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:53,244
The one with Ji-woo and Sang-woo, right?

278
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:54,370
I'm close with them.

279
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,747
Ji-woo used to live
a few houses down from mine.

280
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:58,082
Is that true?

281
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:00,877
-Is that important right now?
-I'm sorry.

282
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,671
Don't just stand there. Come inside.

283
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,465
Let's sit down and chat. Come on.

284
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:08,676
Let's make it simple.

285
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:11,262
Just drop me off where I landed.

286
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:12,847
I'll find my way from there.

287
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,600
It's bright outside. It'll be much easier.

288
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,060
-That's impossible.
-Why?

289
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:20,271
Captain Ri, let her be.

290
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:23,858
Let her get fried like roast chicken
on the electric wires and say,

291
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:27,153
"So this is the danger
of high voltage electric fences."

292
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:28,571
How else would she learn?

293
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:33,326
The electric wires
were turned off yesterday

294
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,453
because the generator
was broken due to the winds.

295
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,663
But they have fixed it now,
so you can't go in there.

296
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,957
That's exactly why I'm asking you
to drop me off.

297
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,293
You're soldiers. It's your turf, right?

298
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:45,505
We just finished two months
of duty at the outpost line

299
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:47,215
and returned to our unit this morning.

300
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:50,051
We can't enter the area for a few months.

301
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,638
Don't talk so irresponsibly
and say that it's impossible.

302
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:56,974
Try to come up with something.

303
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:59,060
There are no other ways.

304
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:02,271
-Burying her would be nice and clean.
-I didn't ask you.

305
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:06,400
That rotten wench.

306
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:07,652
What?

307
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:09,946
"Rotten"?

308
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,198
Is that how you guys curse?

309
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:15,034
Should I reply back
with some South Korean cursing?

310
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:17,954
When it comes to cursing,
we're quite good as well.

311
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:18,913
That's enough.

312
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:23,543
Do you really think deciding
which country is better at swearing

313
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:25,670
is the matter at hand now?

314
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:27,213
Right. I'm too worked up.

315
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,549
Let's talk this through now.

316
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:35,429
So is this the first case
of a South Korean

317
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:37,181
landing in North Korea?

318
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:39,767
Isn't there a protocol
for things like this?

319
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,185
Or a manual?

320
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:43,437
According to the manual,
you'd be interrogated

321
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:45,231
by the State Security Department by now.

322
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,984
You keep talking
about the State Security Department.

323
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:51,362
Is that like a police station or the NIS?

324
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:53,614
I'm sure it's similar.

325
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:57,034
So why didn't you bring me there

326
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,995
when you first saw me?

327
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:04,959
I knew it. If I were to go there
and spill everything,

328
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:07,253
you'd all be in a pickle.

329
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:09,672
Right?

330
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:14,468
That's exactly why
I'm asking you for help.

331
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:17,722
I know you want to deny it,
but we're on the same boat here.

332
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,894
Okay, "Stairway to Heaven",
share your thoughts with us.

333
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:26,772
My uncle works as a boat-to-boat man.

334
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,691
What? Boat what?

335
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:31,485
-Boat-to-boat.
-"Boat-to-boat?"

336
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:35,406
It's when boats meet other boats
on international waters.

337
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,409
You take a small boat
to the middle of the sea

338
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:41,829
and secretly meet with a bigger boat
that is going to another country.

339
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:45,750
That's a great idea. Boat-to-boat.

340
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:50,296
Ju Meok, I'll make sure
I give you Ji-woo's autograph.

341
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:52,506
Really? When?

342
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,300
After the unification.

343
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,010
One day, it'll happen.

344
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:58,137
Anyway, so when does he set out?

345
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,432
He leaves Jinheung Port every 15 days,

346
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:02,642
so three days later.

347
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:04,310
Three days?

348
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,062
Is there a way to leave sooner?

349
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,688
Even if I do leave in three days,

350
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:11,442
it'll take me longer if I have to
go through other countries and stuff.

351
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:16,072
To be frank,
I have a general stockholders' meeting.

352
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:19,200
-Look here.
-This is very important to me.

353
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:21,994
It's the most important moment of my life.

354
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:24,121
Let's make something clear.

355
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:27,625
You're the reason behind all of this.

356
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,835
You're the one who missed
your chance to return home.

357
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:33,464
You should be sorry
causing trouble for everyone.

358
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:36,884
You're right.

359
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,762
I am sorry about that.

360
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,181
I'm sure you're all shocked.

361
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:43,974
Then choose.

362
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,519
-Choose what?
-If you want, I can escort you

363
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:48,729
to the State Security Department
right now.

364
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:50,690
-Captain Ri.
-That's a bit...

365
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:52,650
They might send you home
after the interrogation.

366
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,610
But that means they might not.

367
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:55,945
I can't make promises.

368
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,905
What are the other choices?

369
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:58,864
You told me to choose.

370
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,286
Listen to our orders.

371
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,831
Orders? What kind?

372
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:10,543
First, you may not leave this house
during your time here.

373
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,002
That's a given.

374
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:14,088
I'm not insane. I'm not going anywhere.

375
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,841
Do not talk to any of us.

376
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,592
Do not propagate South Korean beliefs.

377
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:21,470
That's great. Don't talk to me either.

378
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:23,973
And don't propagate anything
because it won't work on me.

379
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,683
Once you return to the South,

380
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:28,060
you may not disclose anything
that happened here.

381
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:31,564
Don't you worry about that.

382
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:33,357
I am definitely not going to tell anyone.

383
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:36,777
I'm going to suffer from amnesia
when I return.

384
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:39,613
Right. She is telling the truth.

385
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:41,240
If you watch South Korean dramas,

386
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,617
nine out of ten
are suffering from amnesia.

387
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:46,162
It's a common illness
in capitalistic countries.

388
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,663
-Is that so?
-Is that

389
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:49,665
because they drink too much American cola?

390
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,418
That is quite fascinating.

391
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:57,840
All right, then.
Let me ask you for a favor.

392
00:20:58,174 --> 00:21:00,050
It's nothing hard.

393
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:02,762
For two out of the three meals I have
every day, I eat meat.

394
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:04,513
I'm a meat lover.

395
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:07,016
Hey, you South Korean.

396
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,392
Don't tell no porky.

397
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:09,977
"Don't tell no porky"?

398
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,147
Does that mean, "Don't kid yourself"?

399
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,190
"Don't kid yourself"?

400
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,400
Does that mean, "Don't tell no porky"?

401
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:18,861
Yes, they mean the same thing.

402
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:21,697
Captain Ri.

403
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:25,743
This wench is pulling sly tricks
to bewitch our men.

404
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:28,746
She's selling loads of porky

405
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:31,999
and propagating about
how South Koreans eat meat twice a day!

406
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:33,417
Whatever you want to believe.

407
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,961
Anyway, that's who I am.

408
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:38,631
But as you all know, I've been starving
for the past two days.

409
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,299
I've walked a long distance as well.

410
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:43,594
My vision is a bit blurry right now.

411
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:47,640
I'm sorry, but do you have some meat?

412
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:00,110
Goodness, you've been waiting.

413
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:01,654
I'm sorry. Sorry about that.

414
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:04,073
It gets busy at the end of the year.

415
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,784
Oh, you should've finished
your work first.

416
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:09,829
Don't be ridiculous.
You're more important than work.

417
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:12,081
Did you forget whom you introduced me to?

418
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,707
You introduced me to your boss.

419
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:18,879
Ever since the contract was signed,

420
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:21,048
no one dares to bother me at work.

421
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:24,468
You know that annoying manager?
Even he can't do anything.

422
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:25,761
These days,

423
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:28,722
I purposely get on his nerves.

424
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:30,349
But he stays silent.

425
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:34,353
You idiot. Why? Why did you do that?

426
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:37,523
No, don't worry. I can do that now.

427
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:38,732
No, you can't.

428
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:42,069
I'm no longer that guy
who was nervous about getting laid off.

429
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:44,154
No, Su-chan. You're wrong.

430
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:47,992
I even managed to put
a ten-billion contract through.

431
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:49,410
Chang-sik.

432
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:52,454
I think I'll get promoted.

433
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,832
My boss has disappeared.

434
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,375
What? What do you mean?

435
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,335
She might be dead already.

436
00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:01,380
It's already been 24 hours
since she was declared missing.

437
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:02,923
Don't joke around.

438
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:04,633
I'm sorry.

439
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:06,385
I truly am.

440
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:10,598
So why did you provoke the manager?
You shouldn't have!

441
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:14,268
Never mind.
I shouldn't have introduced you to her.

442
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:15,436
I'm sorry.

443
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,317
Dear Lord.

444
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:25,112
I pray that my husband will be placed
in the position you've prepared for him

445
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:28,157
as the successor of the company
as soon as possible.

446
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:31,827
Please allow him to receive that honor.

447
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:33,787
Lord, please show your mercy.

448
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:35,205
Rest in peace to those--

449
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:36,373
Lord!

450
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:39,376
No.

451
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:41,128
That's not right.

452
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:43,130
This cannot be.

453
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:46,592
Please help her return safe and sound.

454
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,178
Please keep her uninjured.

455
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:52,473
And of course, please keep her alive.

456
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:54,892
Please allow her to return home.

457
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:58,729
Lord, that's not the case for me.

458
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,981
-Lord--
-Do You hear me?

459
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,816
-I know You're on my side.
-Lord...

460
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,538
GREAT LEADER IS ALWAYS WITH US

461
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,123
Hi.

462
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:20,626
Go on, now.

463
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:55,661
We have less cabbages this year.

464
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:57,413
-Right?
-It's sweet.

465
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,540
It's a total of 2t for five families.

466
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,792
That's only 2,000kg.

467
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,502
Before I got married,

468
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:06,755
my family alone would make 1t of kimchi.

469
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:08,924
I know we'll have less work to do,

470
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:12,302
but I'm worried that we may not have
enough kimchi to last until spring.

471
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:15,305
Hey, you should salt those a bit more.

472
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:16,557
Okay.

473
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:18,392
That's good.

474
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,520
Oh, right.

475
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:22,980
Is it today?

476
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:25,899
Yes, it is.

477
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:31,030
Two months? It's been a long time.

478
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:32,740
Yes, it was way too long.

479
00:25:32,823 --> 00:25:35,409
Excuse me. What are you talking about?

480
00:25:35,576 --> 00:25:39,038
Come on, this isn't something
you should forget.

481
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:42,291
Did you forget that Jeong Hyeok will be
returning from the outpost line today?

482
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,918
Oh, dear! I deserve to die!

483
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:47,463
Gosh, I'm becoming
more forgetful these days.

484
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,673
Don't the other captains

485
00:25:49,757 --> 00:25:53,635
also work at the outpost line?

486
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:57,181
Why do you make it sound like
he's special?

487
00:25:57,264 --> 00:26:00,642
His handsome face is special, isn't it?

488
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:05,022
It's just like how we're protective

489
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:06,857
of national treasures.

490
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:07,775
I see.

491
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:09,443
Look at you.

492
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:12,196
Did we place enough firewood at his place?

493
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:15,324
There's a huge pile. Don't you worry.

494
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:18,535
How about salt, soybean paste,
and red pepper paste?

495
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:21,455
All the crocks are packed with them.

496
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:22,998
And as you've ordered,

497
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:26,460
the meat is resting in the salt crock.

498
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,472
Why do you keep meat in there?

499
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:42,226
The food doesn't go bad
if you put them in the salt crock.

500
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:44,311
What about the other side dishes?

501
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:45,437
Them?

502
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:47,689
This way.

503
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:55,948
What is this place?

504
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,950
Don't you know what a kimchi cellar is?

505
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,619
What? Of course, not.

506
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:04,039
This is called a kimchi cellar.

507
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:06,375
We store our kimchi and pastes in there.

508
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:10,504
Not only won't they go bad,
but they'll ferment deliciously.

509
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:14,091
Oh, my. This place looks

510
00:27:14,842 --> 00:27:16,343
organic.

511
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,513
How should I put it? It's very hip.

512
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:22,724
Are you saying all families have
one of these instead of

513
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:25,686
-a kimchi fridge?
-No talking.

514
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:43,912
What are you looking at so intently?

515
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:47,624
Back in our hometown,

516
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:50,711
we still use fallen leaves and weeds
as firewood.

517
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:54,256
It's so fascinating to see a briquette.

518
00:27:54,965 --> 00:27:57,718
Soon enough, your hometown will modernize,

519
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:59,344
and you will use these too, comrade.

520
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:02,848
If briquettes are considered modern,

521
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:04,516
then how advanced are gas boilers?

522
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:09,062
What?

523
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,106
I was talking to myself.

524
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,482
Is that forbidden as well?

525
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:17,738
Don't overcook it.
I prefer rare over well-done.

526
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,825
I was talking to myself
about my preference in meat.

527
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:36,006
After eating, we must return to our posts.

528
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:38,425
Make sure no one finds out about you.

529
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:41,386
Will I be alone here?

530
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:44,014
Are you saying you want to
stay here with Captain Ri?

531
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:47,309
That's not what I mean.

532
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,394
But what if there's an emergency?

533
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:51,480
I doubt you have mobile phones.

534
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:53,440
Mobile phones?

535
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:56,485
What are these things that we don't have?

536
00:28:56,652 --> 00:28:57,986
They're cell phones.

537
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,821
A cell phone?

538
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:01,365
Of course we have one.

539
00:29:02,032 --> 00:29:03,784
I see. Does everyone have one?

540
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:07,412
We don't have it.

541
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:10,332
But our company commander has one.

542
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:15,212
And a lot of people in the country
have cell phones as well.

543
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:17,881
It's fine as long as he has one.
I'm going to call him anyway.

544
00:29:17,965 --> 00:29:20,008
You're not allowed
to use cellphones in the unit.

545
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:24,054
Then how do I call you when it's urgent?

546
00:29:24,805 --> 00:29:28,141
If you press five,
you'll be connected to my office on base.

547
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,269
It's like the concierge desk at a hotel.

548
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:32,354
This isn't a hotel.

549
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,481
I was just giving you an example.

550
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:36,566
I don't want you to give an example.

551
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:41,530
All right then. I'll call you
if something happens.

552
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:42,948
I'd appreciate it if you don't.

553
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:45,617
I won't call you so often.
Only when it's urgent.

554
00:29:52,082 --> 00:29:54,001
-Hello--
-<i>I'm really sorry,</i>

555
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:56,420
<i>but I'm looking for body wash urgently.</i>

556
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:58,171
<i>I just can't find one.</i>

557
00:29:58,255 --> 00:29:59,631
There must be soap.

558
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:03,510
-Hello--
-<i>What about shampoo?</i>

559
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,178
<i>It's really urgent.</i>

560
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:06,638
Soap.

561
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:12,102
<i>I'm calling to ask you just in case,</i>

562
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:14,354
<i>for the slightest chance</i>
<i>that you actually do, okay?</i>

563
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:16,481
<i>Do you have a scented candle</i>
<i>by any chance?</i>

564
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:22,404
<i>I really need it</i>
<i>when I take a bath or sleep--</i>

565
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:27,701
<i>I'm not getting any hot water.</i>

566
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,537
<i>This is really urgent.</i>

567
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,233
What am I supposed to do?

568
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,319
<i>With the clothespins on the clothesline,</i>

569
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:05,822
There are clothespins.

570
00:31:05,906 --> 00:31:07,783
<i>fix the bath bag.</i>

571
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:19,753
<i>Tuck the bath bag in</i>
<i>under the basin filled with warm water</i>

572
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:21,546
<i>to block airflow.</i>

573
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:28,512
<i>Then you can take a warm bath.</i>

574
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,390
So this is

575
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:35,435
something like a wet sauna for one person?

576
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:37,771
It's amazing.

577
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:42,651
Do I have to do this though?

578
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:48,698
Should I just wait a few days
without showering?

579
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:53,995
It's so warm.

580
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,498
It feels great.

581
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:05,215
-What now?
-<i>Sir, it's me.</i>

582
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:08,969
Hello, Master Sergeant. What's the matter?

583
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:11,263
<i>In the car crash</i>
<i>this morning in Mount Suseok,</i>

584
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:14,182
<i>all the tomb raiders being taken</i>
<i>to Pyongyang were also killed.</i>

585
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:18,311
STATE SECURITY DEPARTMENT

586
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:23,817
RI JEONG HYEOK

587
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:31,241
<i>It keeps happening.</i>
<i>Do you think it's a coincidence?</i>

588
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:34,744
<i>Could it be true that</i>
<i>the State Security Department is keeping</i>

589
00:32:34,828 --> 00:32:36,163
<i>a secret truck unit?</i>

590
00:32:37,164 --> 00:32:38,915
LET'S WORK FOR PEACE IN KOREA

591
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:41,418
STAY HIGH TO FIND OUT THOSE WHO HIDE DEEP

592
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:15,494
You're Captain Ri Jeong Hyeok,
the Company 5 Commander.

593
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:17,162
Your company was realigned today, right?

594
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:18,205
Yes, sir.

595
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:21,875
Have a seat and have some stick coffee.

596
00:33:28,632 --> 00:33:32,010
This coffee is from down South.

597
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:34,054
No thank you, sir.

598
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:35,138
Why?

599
00:33:35,764 --> 00:33:37,557
Because they're
relief goods from South Korea?

600
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:40,810
I also felt uncomfortable at first,

601
00:33:40,894 --> 00:33:43,980
but now I can't have enough
of its bitter-sweet taste.

602
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:49,277
I don't think you like sweet things.

603
00:33:49,903 --> 00:33:51,780
I have something to report to you.

604
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:53,073
Go ahead.

605
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:56,409
I heard the convoy turned over
from a car crash this morning

606
00:33:56,493 --> 00:33:58,203
and all the tomb raiders got killed.

607
00:33:59,246 --> 00:34:01,581
I heard it. I feel bad,
but what can we do?

608
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:04,084
I believe it needs an investigation.

609
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,795
What car did they crash into?

610
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,338
Was it accidental or intentional?

611
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:11,174
If it was intentional, who is behind it?

612
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:14,803
And why do incidents
like this keep happening?

613
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:20,725
You sure have a lot of questions, Captain.

614
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:22,269
Please let me look into it.

615
00:34:24,271 --> 00:34:25,522
Okay. Go ahead.

616
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:28,233
The Trial Bureau is
in charge of the accident,

617
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:29,442
I'll let them know.

618
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:32,779
You should go
to the headquarters in Pyongyang tomorrow.

619
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:45,500
Are you sure it'll be okay?

620
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:50,547
The director is a friend of mine.

621
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:54,384
Why is Ri Jeong Hyeok being
such a stuffed shirt by the way?

622
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:55,927
Does he have a good backing?

623
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:59,264
His resume doesn't have anything
about family background.

624
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:01,933
I'm not sure what he is like yet.

625
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:03,435
Really?

626
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:05,770
Senior Colonel.

627
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,233
I guess there might be a new account.

628
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:13,403
Who is it this time?

629
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:16,281
CHILBOSAN HOTAL

630
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:18,867
<i>He's in hiding</i>
<i>after the one-billion-won scheme.</i>

631
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:20,744
<i>He's come to Shenyang</i>

632
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:24,205
<i>after passing through the Philippines</i>
<i>and Malaysia to evade the police.</i>

633
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:25,123
You're pretty.

634
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:27,208
<i>We can be sure</i>
<i>about the size of his wealth.</i>

635
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:31,296
<i>And he doesn't mind</i>
<i>spending money for himself.</i>

636
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:33,673
<i>It's perfect for us to keep him around.</i>

637
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:35,550
Is he here?

638
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:48,188
Mr. Cheon.

639
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:53,234
It's been a long time. Nice to meet you.

640
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:55,028
Well...

641
00:36:04,788 --> 00:36:07,749
We don't have time,
so I won't beat around the bush.

642
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:12,754
Once you sign the contract,
you will be safe.

643
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:15,006
We will make sure to protect you

644
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:17,342
and take you to North Korea safely.

645
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:20,220
We have various deals
with different prices.

646
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:22,138
It starts from 20,000 dollars per month.

647
00:36:22,222 --> 00:36:24,766
The size of your home,
medical service, leisure activities,

648
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,935
radius of coverage, to life insurance.

649
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:29,688
Everything can vary.

650
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:32,148
What about the most expensive one?

651
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:34,901
It's 100,000 dollars per month.

652
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:37,612
It's 1.2 million dollars per year.

653
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:38,655
OFF-LIMITES TO CIVILIANS

654
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:40,782
<i>You get a two-story house</i>
<i>with a reception room,</i>

655
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:43,576
<i>an indoor sauna, and a swimming pool.</i>

656
00:36:45,412 --> 00:36:47,789
<i>You also get five</i>
<i>specially trained bodyguards.</i>

657
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,293
<i>Professed cooks, housekeepers,</i>

658
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,672
<i>chauffeurs, and gardeners</i>
<i>are also included.</i>

659
00:36:56,756 --> 00:37:00,385
You can enjoy leisure activities
like golf and hunting if you want.

660
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,512
You can also enter casinos.

661
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,764
What would you do?

662
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:07,308
I'll pay 200,000 dollars a month.

663
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:10,353
It's 2.4 million dollars a year.

664
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:16,025
But you'd better not change your words
after I enter the country.

665
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:20,739
You guys should remember that
all my money is in my offshore accounts.

666
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:23,324
If someone harms a hair of my head,

667
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:26,703
there's no way you will get my money.

668
00:37:27,454 --> 00:37:28,538
Okay?

669
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:30,290
Mr. Gu Seung-jun.

670
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,084
The statute of limitations
on assault is five years.

671
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:34,794
Seven years for injuring.

672
00:37:34,878 --> 00:37:37,464
And 10 years for a fraud case like yours.

673
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:41,676
A lot of people from South Korea
have spent the statute of limitations here

674
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,345
under the protection of my people

675
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:47,140
to evade the police of South Korea
and Interpol.

676
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:49,726
Well. I know that.

677
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:52,145
That's why I'm right here.

678
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:54,606
We are doing this business
risking our lives.

679
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:58,318
To protect our customers
who committed illegal acts,

680
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:01,112
we have to commit illegal acts ourselves.

681
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:03,740
So without mutual trust,

682
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:06,159
I'm afraid we can make this contract.

683
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:09,496
Gosh, I get it.

684
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:11,372
Why are you being so serious?

685
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,166
Gosh.

686
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:16,878
I was going to North Korea
just to tour around Mount Geumgang.

687
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,422
GU SEUNG-JUN

688
00:38:19,506 --> 00:38:22,008
One, two, three.

689
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:23,760
Four, five, six.

690
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,637
-Seven, eight, nine, ten.
-Guys.

691
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,138
Nam Sik.

692
00:38:27,931 --> 00:38:30,683
Why are you still here?
Do you know what time it is now?

693
00:38:30,767 --> 00:38:32,435
-Come right away.
-Mom.

694
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:34,979
-Come here.
-I told you to come right away.

695
00:38:35,063 --> 00:38:37,148
Go. Your mom is looking for you.

696
00:38:37,232 --> 00:38:38,441
-Mom!
-Let's go.

697
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:40,610
-Come here.
-We should hurry.

698
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:48,368
U Pil.

699
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:50,829
Dad!

700
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:56,751
What are you doing here alone?

701
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:57,794
What is this?

702
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:03,007
It's your favorite doughnut.

703
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:06,177
-Let's go.
-Okay.

704
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:19,357
What?

705
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:22,569
Haven't I had enough surprises today?

706
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:27,782
<i>Honey, the power is out.</i>

707
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:29,826
<i>Will you get the lamp?</i>

708
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:37,166
A HEADBAND WITH A SMALL BULB IS USED
LIKE A DESK LAMP DURING BLACKOUT

709
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:42,839
Let's eat.

710
00:39:47,677 --> 00:39:49,012
What?

711
00:39:50,013 --> 00:39:52,390
What are they up to?

712
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:04,819
I knew it. He's not answering.

713
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,781
Are they going to bury me or something?

714
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:18,750
Where's a flashlight?

715
00:41:14,514 --> 00:41:16,349
What are you doing?

716
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:20,853
Why are you here?

717
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:23,356
You said you need a candle.

718
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,571
You need it

719
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:32,740
when you take a bath and go to sleep.

720
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:35,451
This is just a candle.

721
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:37,912
What I need

722
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:40,915
is a scented candle.

723
00:41:53,803 --> 00:41:55,388
I'm sorry.

724
00:41:57,557 --> 00:41:59,684
I know you'd feel flustered.

725
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,353
But I just can't believe

726
00:42:03,146 --> 00:42:05,565
what I'm going through now.

727
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:23,666
SELF-SUFFICIENT

728
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:57,283
Gosh, will you hurry?

729
00:42:59,452 --> 00:43:02,330
What if someone finds it out?

730
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:10,254
Gosh, it's bright.

731
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:13,925
Ho Yeong, can you finish
your homework now?

732
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:16,511
Mom, now that the power is out,

733
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,137
I can just go to sleep.

734
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:20,640
You rascal.

735
00:43:21,057 --> 00:43:25,436
Your dad even brought the tank battery
in secret to light up the room.

736
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,230
Just go ahead and finish your homework.

737
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:29,649
If you go foot again this time,

738
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:31,859
I'll strip you off
and throw you out of the house.

739
00:43:31,943 --> 00:43:33,653
I'm not at the bottom.

740
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:35,238
Nam Sik is behind me.

741
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:36,489
Is that so?

742
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:39,534
You must feel reassured
to have Nam Sik behind you.

743
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:41,369
Just do it.

744
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:44,789
You silly rascal.

745
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,293
Honey.

746
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:53,798
Do you think there's a chance
you can get promoted this time?

747
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:54,924
I'm not sure.

748
00:43:55,216 --> 00:43:57,176
It's up to the senior colonel
who grades soldiers.

749
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:58,678
Darn it.

750
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,515
Why is the senior colonel
being so harsh on you?

751
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:05,309
So you should try currying favor

752
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:06,644
with his wife.

753
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:09,522
I've been trying really hard
to get on the right side of her.

754
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:10,648
Why would you say that?

755
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:12,692
About Captain Na's wife.

756
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:15,862
I saw her going to his place
with some stuff.

757
00:44:15,945 --> 00:44:17,446
What?

758
00:44:23,536 --> 00:44:25,705
Ms. Ma, are you in there?

759
00:44:30,418 --> 00:44:31,627
Ms. Ma.

760
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:33,713
You're here.

761
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:36,132
Take a look at Ok Geum.

762
00:44:36,257 --> 00:44:37,508
She's running the generator

763
00:44:37,592 --> 00:44:39,927
so I can watch TV.

764
00:44:40,887 --> 00:44:43,472
Ok Geum, are your legs okay?

765
00:44:43,556 --> 00:44:44,682
I'm fine.

766
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:49,020
I'm just happy to see you
burst into laughter.

767
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:51,314
I don't care even if my legs break.

768
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:52,732
It's no problem.

769
00:45:05,286 --> 00:45:06,621
Sang-a.

770
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:12,668
I ate too much at dinner.

771
00:45:12,752 --> 00:45:14,253
I feel so bloated.

772
00:45:14,337 --> 00:45:15,379
I see.

773
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:18,382
Any news yet?

774
00:45:18,466 --> 00:45:21,093
We would've got a call
if there's something new.

775
00:45:21,177 --> 00:45:22,762
I feel bad for her. She's so young.

776
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:25,056
She didn't even get married.

777
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:28,142
I mean, Father even said
he'd hand his business

778
00:45:28,226 --> 00:45:29,727
over to her.

779
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:31,771
She might have thought it would happen.

780
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:33,147
What unfortunate timing.

781
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:34,523
What do you mean?

782
00:45:34,607 --> 00:45:37,193
I mean, we all knew

783
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:38,903
that Father didn't really mean it.

784
00:45:40,071 --> 00:45:41,781
He actually didn't mean
anything like that.

785
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:43,866
He just wanted to provoke my husband.

786
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:45,493
He'd give it to his oldest son anyway,

787
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:47,912
but he just wants his son to try harder.

788
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:51,123
So he lied that
his daughter would take it over.

789
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:53,251
He's so cunning.

790
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:58,923
<i>Seri's Choice with its stocks</i>
<i>remaining strong for three days</i>

791
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:01,926
<i>is receiving peculiar attention</i>
<i>in the stock market.</i>

792
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:06,097
<i>-Seri's Choice is...</i>
-Once the news about the CEO goes out,

793
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,807
the stock price will plunge.

794
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:10,101
<i>Based on this, local investors...</i>

795
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:12,061
<i>Do you know anything about stocks?</i>

796
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:15,106
I bet you don't.

797
00:46:16,107 --> 00:46:17,650
Stock prices fluctuate

798
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:21,612
by as much as billions of won
from day to day.

799
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:26,117
I once invested three billion won
in stocks because of my acquaintance

800
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,493
and lost all the money.

801
00:46:36,127 --> 00:46:37,670
But...

802
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:41,507
I'm more frustrated than I was back then.

803
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:44,969
Than the day I lost my three billion won,

804
00:46:45,678 --> 00:46:48,556
I'm even more frustrated and sad.

805
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:51,767
What am I doing here?

806
00:46:52,393 --> 00:46:56,022
I wasn't even interested
in where North Korea is located.

807
00:46:56,522 --> 00:46:59,275
And why do I have to be crying

808
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:01,235
in front of a total stranger?

809
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:03,904
It's so frustrating.

810
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:13,956
Don't worry. I can't see you now.

811
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:18,085
Fortune and misfortune
are like twisted rope,

812
00:47:18,169 --> 00:47:19,670
so they come by turns.

813
00:47:20,296 --> 00:47:22,840
Everything will be fine soon.

814
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:25,176
Are you sure?

815
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,428
I'm sure.

816
00:47:33,017 --> 00:47:34,226
Where are you going?

817
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:37,396
I need to get on the train
to Pyongyang in the morning.

818
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:38,647
Pyongyang?

819
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:41,525
When are you coming back?

820
00:47:42,151 --> 00:47:43,152
I don't know.

821
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:46,238
I might not be able to see you leave.

822
00:47:46,322 --> 00:47:49,575
My comrades will be helping you.
Don't worry.

823
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:52,912
I bought some stuff you might need.

824
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:06,175
Wait.

825
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:11,514
What's your name?

826
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:14,725
I want to remember it

827
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:16,644
because I want to return the favor.

828
00:48:17,228 --> 00:48:19,563
You don't have to.
There was no favor to begin with.

829
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:23,442
As I asked you earlier,

830
00:48:23,526 --> 00:48:26,278
Please don't tell anyone
what happened here when you go back.

831
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:29,198
Even better, just forget about it.

832
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:57,017
What's all this?

833
00:49:00,563 --> 00:49:02,273
What is this?

834
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:07,778
What happened to using
a block of soap from head to toe?

835
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,781
These are all from South Korea.

836
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:32,636
Where did he get these?

837
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:39,226
Are you looking for cosmetics?

838
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:44,440
These are from down there.

839
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:46,609
This is skin toner,
and this is cleansing cream.

840
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:48,903
This is day cream,
and that one is night cream.

841
00:49:49,278 --> 00:49:50,488
Which one do you want?

842
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:52,406
I want them all.

843
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:02,666
My gosh.

844
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:04,710
<i>Do you need underwear?</i>

845
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:07,379
These are from down there as well.

846
00:50:07,755 --> 00:50:10,257
This is Vivian, and this is Venus.

847
00:50:10,341 --> 00:50:12,134
That one is Bodyguard.

848
00:50:12,218 --> 00:50:13,469
What do you want?

849
00:50:14,887 --> 00:50:15,888
I'll take them all, too.

850
00:50:17,598 --> 00:50:18,974
What size?

851
00:50:19,058 --> 00:50:20,851
What size do you need?

852
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:26,732
Anything will do.

853
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:33,364
Gosh, I guess he overestimated me.

854
00:50:33,948 --> 00:50:35,491
It would probably fit.

855
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:47,920
What was that?

856
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:51,757
He pretends to be indifferent,
but he's kind of sweet.

857
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:09,024
If this is a dream,

858
00:51:10,359 --> 00:51:12,611
please let me wake up from it.

859
00:51:28,252 --> 00:51:32,631
The latex mattress
is so snug and comforting.

860
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:36,802
This is my bed.

861
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:06,206
I knew it. It was just a dream.

862
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:09,627
I knew it wasn't real.

863
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:11,253
North Korea?

864
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:14,089
Gosh, it was just a horrible nightmare.

865
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:27,770
What is it doing here?

866
00:52:29,313 --> 00:52:30,939
It's not supposed to be here.

867
00:52:31,023 --> 00:52:32,650
No.

868
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:34,526
This isn't a dream.

869
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:36,153
Earlier was a dream.

870
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:37,905
This can't be a dream.

871
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:39,198
Don't wake up.

872
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:41,075
No. <i>Don't wake up.</i>

873
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:43,077
<i>I'm not waking up.</i>

874
00:52:47,623 --> 00:52:49,541
<i>How care have you come?</i>

875
00:52:49,625 --> 00:52:51,460
<i>I've come this far.</i>

876
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:53,379

00:53:53,731 --> 00:53:55,357
Will you hurry?

886
00:53:55,441 --> 00:53:56,775
Come over this way.

887
00:53:56,859 --> 00:53:58,068
What's the rush?

888
00:54:00,154 --> 00:54:01,447
Come here.

889
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:02,823
Please show your identification.

890
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:04,742
-Hurry.
-Wait for me.

891
00:54:04,825 --> 00:54:06,368
-Excuse me.
-Move over.

892
00:54:08,162 --> 00:54:09,747
RI JEONG HYEOK

893
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:13,208
Are you Captain Ri Jeong Hyeok

894
00:54:13,292 --> 00:54:14,835
from the Civilian Police Battalion?

895
00:54:15,127 --> 00:54:16,336
Yes.

896
00:54:16,712 --> 00:54:18,297
He's right here.

897
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:23,886
We're from the Investigation Division
of the Trial Bureau.

898
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:25,637
I was on my way
to the Security Department.

899
00:54:25,721 --> 00:54:27,014
I have a case to investigate.

900
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:28,557
Hey, Ri Jeong Hyeok.

901
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,851
You're the one to be investigated.

902
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:32,895
Come with us.

903
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:42,321
DEFENSE SECURITY COMMAND

904
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:52,623
You've never been in a place
like this before, have you?

905
00:54:53,457 --> 00:54:54,750
Too bad.

906
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:56,960
There's no place else you can sit.

907
00:54:57,503 --> 00:54:58,337
Have a seat.

908
00:55:06,887 --> 00:55:10,891
Let's begin with a conversation.

909
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:15,354
Please.

910
00:55:16,814 --> 00:55:20,984
I heard you disgraced the citizens
who work hard to earn foreign currency.

911
00:55:21,068 --> 00:55:23,695
Right in front of South Korean soldiers.

912
00:55:23,779 --> 00:55:26,949
They illegally crossed
the southern limit for tomb robberies.

913
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:29,243
Would you call it legitimate work?

914
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:31,203
You think? All right then.

915
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:33,455
Where are the cultural properties now?

916
00:55:33,539 --> 00:55:35,916
All the tomb raiders died in the accident.

917
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:38,335
There's no way we can find it out.

918
00:55:39,253 --> 00:55:42,172
If Lieutenant Commander Jo Cheol Gang
from the State Security Department

919
00:55:42,256 --> 00:55:43,841
investigated the case,

920
00:55:43,924 --> 00:55:45,717
he would've figured it all out.

921
00:55:45,801 --> 00:55:49,596
But you insisted to send them
to the headquarters in Pyongyang

922
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,683
and they ended up dying
in a questionable accident.

923
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:55,936
So we can't help but suspect you.

924
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:58,522
It's common sense not to let the permitter

925
00:55:58,605 --> 00:56:00,023
investigate the case.

926
00:56:00,649 --> 00:56:03,402
Do you think this is
a common-sense question?

927
00:56:05,112 --> 00:56:07,865
-Common sense?
-I'm asking you to make wild speculations.

928
00:56:07,948 --> 00:56:09,575
Do you have any evidence?

929
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:12,327
Hey.

930
00:56:12,953 --> 00:56:15,956
Do you think you can drive a nail
only when there's a crack?

931
00:56:16,582 --> 00:56:18,709
If you hammer a nail,
it will make a crack.

932
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:20,460
This is where we hammer a nail.

933
00:56:20,544 --> 00:56:21,628
We don't need evidence.

934
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:25,173
We can make up any crimes
if we want to. Do you understand?

935
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:27,134
Is that so?

936
00:56:27,718 --> 00:56:29,761
You will have to be responsible
for what you said now.

937
00:56:30,721 --> 00:56:31,763
You idiot!

938
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:35,267
What kind of jerk caused trouble
and got hauled in here?

939
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:36,894
What did you just say?

940
00:56:36,977 --> 00:56:38,770
Say that again.
How dare you say such a thing!

941
00:56:40,981 --> 00:56:42,608
Who's that guy?

942
00:56:44,026 --> 00:56:45,027
Hey!

943
00:56:48,155 --> 00:56:50,032
General, what bring you--

944
00:56:51,158 --> 00:56:53,827
Have you lost your mind?
Are you out of your head?

945
00:56:55,996 --> 00:56:58,874
Jeong Hyeok, are you all right?

946
00:56:59,458 --> 00:57:00,751
I'm fine.

947
00:57:02,711 --> 00:57:05,672
What are you waiting for?
Take him to my office.

948
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:11,219
General, who on earth is he...

949
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:14,014
You're so doomed, you idiot.

950
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:17,684
He is the only son of the Director
of the General Political Bureau.

951
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:19,394
What?

952
00:57:20,771 --> 00:57:21,855
My goodness.

953
00:57:42,793 --> 00:57:44,670
-Hello.
<i>-You, Jo Cheol Gang!</i>

954
00:57:44,753 --> 00:57:47,047
<i>Are you trying to see</i>

955
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:49,675
<i>-how badly you can ruin my career?</i>
-What's wrong?

956
00:57:49,758 --> 00:57:53,929
Tell me. Do you know who
Captain Ri Jeong Hyeok's father is or not?

957
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:56,598
<i>The section of army related officers</i>
<i>was empty, so I couldn't check.</i>

958
00:57:56,682 --> 00:57:58,350
Why do you think the section was empty?

959
00:57:58,433 --> 00:58:00,519
It was because
he comes from an influential family!

960
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:02,604
What are you talking about?
Explain it to me.

961
00:58:02,688 --> 00:58:05,565
Brace yourself. Don't pass out.

962
00:58:05,649 --> 00:58:06,942
Ri Jeong Hyeok is...

963
00:58:07,526 --> 00:58:08,402
He's

964
00:58:09,111 --> 00:58:11,113
the son of Director
of the General Political Bureau.

965
00:58:11,863 --> 00:58:13,865
What did you just say?

966
00:58:13,949 --> 00:58:17,369
<i>That's right. It will take more than once</i>
<i>for you to hear it to understand, right?</i>

967
00:58:17,828 --> 00:58:20,414
<i>He's the son of the Director</i>
<i>of the General Political Bureau.</i>

968
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:22,457
<i>And the director had two sons.</i>

969
00:58:22,541 --> 00:58:23,917
<i>But he lost a son in an accident.</i>

970
00:58:24,001 --> 00:58:26,837
<i>-So he's the only son the director has.</i>
-Are you sure?

971
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:29,381
<i>You know what? I hope I'm wrong!</i>

972
00:58:30,007 --> 00:58:32,467
<i>How are you going to handle this mess?</i>

973
00:58:32,551 --> 00:58:33,635
I'll call you tomorrow.

974
00:58:33,719 --> 00:58:37,055
<i>I don't even know</i>
<i>if I'll still be in the office by then.</i>

975
00:58:37,139 --> 00:58:39,057
<i>How could I not have...</i>

976
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:46,606
<i>He's my younger brother.</i>

977
00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:49,484
<i>Say hello. He's my friend.</i>

978
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:58,452
Then, the younger brother of Mu Hyeok

979
00:58:59,703 --> 00:59:01,163
was Ri Jeong Hyeok?

980
00:59:08,462 --> 00:59:11,006
So does Dae-gil live or die?

981
00:59:16,595 --> 00:59:21,141
Please tell me. I only watched
<i>The Slave Hunters</i> up to the 14th episode.

982
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:25,103
What happens to Dae-gil?

983
00:59:25,937 --> 00:59:26,855
Dae-gil

984
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:30,901
-dies.
-Damn it.

985
00:59:31,193 --> 00:59:32,736
Really?

986
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:36,239
My gosh, I can't believe
Dae-gil dies in the drama.

987
00:59:36,323 --> 00:59:37,449
You can't feel bad

988
00:59:37,532 --> 00:59:39,910
for a character in a drama
that aired ten years ago.

989
00:59:41,328 --> 00:59:42,871
Did you come here to hang out with her?

990
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:45,165
I'm sorry.

991
00:59:46,291 --> 00:59:47,709
Gwang Beom. Eun Dong.

992
00:59:47,793 --> 00:59:49,461
-Let's continue this after some food.
-Okay.

993
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:52,631
By the way, why are you guys shoveling?

994
00:59:52,714 --> 00:59:53,924
Why do you think?

995
00:59:54,174 --> 00:59:57,594
We're trying to bury this rude
South Korean woman in the pit.

996
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:01,389
We're doing construction
on the underground water here.

997
01:00:02,057 --> 01:00:04,392
Captain Ri told us to protect you.

998
01:00:04,476 --> 01:00:07,562
We need an excuse to bring you out
from the base without drawing suspicions.

999
01:00:08,688 --> 01:00:12,317
Is that what your captain told you to do?

1000
01:00:12,692 --> 01:00:14,027
Did he tell you to protect me?

1001
01:00:14,653 --> 01:00:15,946
Quit dreaming.

1002
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:18,824
He wants us to keep an eye on you.

1003
01:00:18,907 --> 01:00:22,244
You, a South Korean spy, might commit
heinous crimes in our country.

1004
01:00:22,828 --> 01:00:24,079
What's your name?

1005
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:26,498
It's Pyo Chi Su. Why do you ask?

1006
01:00:26,581 --> 01:00:30,168
I see. When our countries unite,
you'd better emigrate somewhere else.

1007
01:00:30,252 --> 01:00:32,420
I'll find you no matter what it takes

1008
01:00:32,504 --> 01:00:34,339
and bury you deep in the ground.

1009
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:38,802
You ungrateful woman.

1010
01:00:39,594 --> 01:00:40,762
What is your name?

1011
01:00:40,846 --> 01:00:43,765
Do you think I'm a fool?
Why would I tell you that?

1012
01:00:49,229 --> 01:00:50,397
By the way,

1013
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:54,860
why did your captain
go to Pyongyang all of a sudden?

1014
01:00:58,738 --> 01:01:03,076
So about what happened today...
I'm really sorry about that.

1015
01:01:03,994 --> 01:01:05,495
You don't need to apologize for that.

1016
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:07,247
It's just that

1017
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:11,168
I really want to find the vehicle
that caused the crash.

1018
01:01:11,585 --> 01:01:14,254
Are you paying attention to the accident
because you think it might be

1019
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:16,131
related to your brother's accident?

1020
01:01:17,966 --> 01:01:21,094
A car crash at the intersection
in Jeonseung-dong in 2011.

1021
01:01:21,178 --> 01:01:24,014
A rollover crash on Nampo Expressway
in 2013.

1022
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:28,101
A 3-car pileup collision
at Cave Rainbow in 2014.

1023
01:01:31,188 --> 01:01:33,565
All of them were caused
by a Russian Kamaz truck.

1024
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:36,818
Everyone involved in the accidents died.

1025
01:01:37,194 --> 01:01:39,446
Despite the rumor
that there is a secret truck unit,

1026
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:41,948
the State Security Department
didn't investigate further.

1027
01:01:43,325 --> 01:01:45,869
I checked the security footages
near Mount Suseok.

1028
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:49,247
Three Kamaz trucks passed
before the accident.

1029
01:01:49,331 --> 01:01:51,458
Well, that's a very common truck.

1030
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:54,336
Is that what you really believe?
It's just a coincidence?

1031
01:01:56,630 --> 01:02:00,550
Jeong Hyeok, do you only look
at one side of things?

1032
01:02:01,676 --> 01:02:03,678
If your mind is already made up,

1033
01:02:03,845 --> 01:02:05,931
everything will look suspicious.

1034
01:02:07,015 --> 01:02:09,059
Why do we have eyes
on the front of our head?

1035
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:11,603
It means we must face forward.

1036
01:02:12,103 --> 01:02:14,481
Put your past behind you.

1037
01:02:15,065 --> 01:02:16,775
And face forward now.

1038
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:23,615
-Why did they kill Dae-gil?
-You must be mad.

1039
01:02:23,698 --> 01:02:25,825
Hey, quit talking about that man.

1040
01:02:25,909 --> 01:02:28,453
I should have buried her today.

1041
01:02:28,536 --> 01:02:30,330
I will regret for the rest of my life...

1042
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:35,126
You're in the Fifth Company.
Where are you coming from?

1043
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:37,879
From fixing the pump
at our captain's house, sir.

1044
01:02:38,797 --> 01:02:39,798
Is that so?

1045
01:02:41,091 --> 01:02:43,718
Well, he's in Pyongyang now.

1046
01:02:44,511 --> 01:02:46,179
-Good work.
-Yes, sir.

1047
01:02:46,304 --> 01:02:48,932
May I ask where you are headed, sir?

1048
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:52,852
Lately, we have a lot of runaways.

1049
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:56,106
I'm going to run random house inspection
on the houses today.

1050
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:58,942
You mean tonight, sir?

1051
01:03:02,404 --> 01:03:04,239
-What's wrong with him?
-It's nothing.

1052
01:03:04,823 --> 01:03:06,032
We miss what's in front of us.

1053
01:03:06,116 --> 01:03:08,493
The runaways might be hiding
in the military base.

1054
01:03:08,576 --> 01:03:10,745
I believe that it is a very wise plan.

1055
01:03:11,705 --> 01:03:15,125
That's right. Everyone, go back inside
and get ready to sleep.

1056
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:16,084
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

1057
01:03:23,383 --> 01:03:25,260
Captain Ri, we have a problem.

1058
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:28,638
They are going to run random inspections
on the military housing area.

1059
01:03:28,722 --> 01:03:29,723
But

1060
01:03:30,724 --> 01:03:32,934
we told the South Korean woman

1061
01:03:33,018 --> 01:03:36,688
never to pick up
any phone calls, just in case.

1062
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:38,982
<i>There's no way to reach her now.</i>

1063
01:03:48,867 --> 01:03:50,910
Let me ask you for a favor.

1064
01:04:05,133 --> 01:04:07,844
MUNSU STREET

1065
01:04:39,084 --> 01:04:41,461
<i>Grant access through all areas.</i>

1066
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:43,213
<i>Grant access immediately.</i>

1067
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:02,023
What's wrong with that car?

1068
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:03,608
That's really fast.

1069
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:08,446
Hey, the plate starts with 729.

1070
01:05:08,530 --> 01:05:10,573
Only the highest-ranking officials
have that number.

1071
01:05:10,657 --> 01:05:13,785
If you stop that car,
you'll be stopping your life, too.

1072
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:18,790
All right now.

1073
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:21,626
Let the house inspection begin.

1074
01:05:23,002 --> 01:05:24,921
Someone told me

1075
01:05:25,505 --> 01:05:27,715
that you were spotted buying

1076
01:05:27,799 --> 01:05:30,135
a South Korean talking rice cooker
at the market.

1077
01:05:30,218 --> 01:05:34,305
Who on earth told you
such an absurd thing?

1078
01:05:34,389 --> 01:05:37,392
I was taught to always speak the truth
regardless of the situation I was in.

1079
01:05:37,475 --> 01:05:39,102
A talking rice cooker?

1080
01:05:39,185 --> 01:05:41,896
And a South Koran talking rice cooker?

1081
01:05:42,147 --> 01:05:44,983
I don't have enough time to complete
my tasks for our revolution.

1082
01:05:45,567 --> 01:05:47,902
Why would I go around
and buy something like that?

1083
01:05:47,986 --> 01:05:49,821
That's a conspiracy.

1084
01:05:49,904 --> 01:05:52,115
<i>Your rice is ready.</i>

1085
01:05:52,824 --> 01:05:54,033
<i>Please stir it well.</i>

1086
01:05:57,495 --> 01:05:58,496
Move.

1087
01:05:59,873 --> 01:06:01,791
Goodness.

1088
01:06:03,084 --> 01:06:05,628
What on earth is this?

1089
01:06:05,712 --> 01:06:06,921
What is it?

1090
01:06:07,589 --> 01:06:09,632
Wol Suk. Please look at me.

1091
01:06:09,716 --> 01:06:11,968
I'm kneeling down right now.

1092
01:06:12,051 --> 01:06:17,015
I was wondering who was stealing
our hard-earned electricity.

1093
01:06:17,265 --> 01:06:19,601
And the thief had been here all along.

1094
01:06:19,684 --> 01:06:23,563
I lost myself when I tasted
the sticky rice from the rice cooker.

1095
01:06:23,897 --> 01:06:26,024
I must have lost my mind.

1096
01:06:26,107 --> 01:06:29,736
Please turn a blind eye just this once.

1097
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:32,113
Then, what are you going to do
with this rice cooker?

1098
01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:35,867
As for that electricity-stealing thief,

1099
01:06:36,242 --> 01:06:39,704
I ask that you take care of it
on your own.

1100
01:06:41,915 --> 01:06:43,708
Is the rice really that sticky?

1101
01:06:43,791 --> 01:06:46,252
You should have a taste.

1102
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:51,758
There's nothing here.

1103
01:06:52,342 --> 01:06:53,635
Let's move on to the next house.

1104
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:59,224
My goodness.

1105
01:07:00,975 --> 01:07:04,354
No one is here.
But look at this messy room.

1106
01:07:17,617 --> 01:07:20,370
Come on out, sir.

1107
01:07:32,382 --> 01:07:35,927
What on earth are you doing here?

1108
01:07:36,511 --> 01:07:39,847
Your wife is doing the long-distance trade

1109
01:07:39,931 --> 01:07:42,850
in order to put food on the table
for her family.

1110
01:07:43,351 --> 01:07:45,562
-What on earth are you--
-Comrade Wol Suk.

1111
01:07:47,397 --> 01:07:48,314
I was just lonely.

1112
01:07:48,398 --> 01:07:51,109
I see. You're lonely?

1113
01:07:51,192 --> 01:07:53,778
In that case,
I won't make you feel lonely.

1114
01:07:54,195 --> 01:07:56,948
How about a nice self-criticism session

1115
01:07:57,031 --> 01:07:59,033
in front of everyone, then?

1116
01:07:59,117 --> 01:08:02,579
You can tell them
why you had to be naked in front

1117
01:08:02,662 --> 01:08:06,499
of another woman
in the middle of the night.

1118
01:08:10,545 --> 01:08:13,881
That bastard. I can't even treat him
like a human being now.

1119
01:08:14,591 --> 01:08:16,342
-Which one is next?
-Next is

1120
01:08:18,803 --> 01:08:20,930
Captain Ri Jeong Hyeok.

1121
01:08:21,014 --> 01:08:22,307
Is that so?

1122
01:08:33,985 --> 01:08:40,825
PARADISE OF PEOPLE

1123
01:08:42,535 --> 01:08:44,203
Supervisor Jo.

1124
01:08:44,287 --> 01:08:46,873
We were inspecting the houses.

1125
01:08:47,081 --> 01:08:48,124
What's the next house?

1126
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:50,293
It's Captain Ri Jeong Hyeok's.

1127
01:08:50,376 --> 01:08:52,003
He's in Pyongyang.

1128
01:08:52,837 --> 01:08:53,838
Pardon?

1129
01:08:55,089 --> 01:08:56,507
But

1130
01:08:56,924 --> 01:08:59,218
the light at his house is on.

1131
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:02,722
Did he come back already?

1132
01:09:10,647 --> 01:09:12,231
Why are there so many books here?

1133
01:09:19,822 --> 01:09:21,366
Piano sheets?

1134
01:09:25,036 --> 01:09:26,412
"Mozart."

1135
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:36,339
APPLICATION FORM

1136
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:40,259
I've seen this face

1137
01:09:42,053 --> 01:09:44,013
from somewhere.

1138
01:09:47,433 --> 01:09:49,519
I am here for house inspection.

1139
01:09:49,602 --> 01:09:51,270
What's "House inspection"?

1140
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:55,358
Captain Ri Jeong Hyeok.

1141
01:09:56,109 --> 01:09:57,985
I don't think he's back yet.

1142
01:09:58,069 --> 01:09:59,696
-Unlock the door.
-Pardon?

1143
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:03,199
It's not just anyone's house.

1144
01:10:03,282 --> 01:10:04,992
-It's Captain Ri's.
-Do it now.

1145
01:10:05,076 --> 01:10:06,327
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

1146
01:10:35,648 --> 01:10:37,692
I believe someone was just here.

1147
01:10:52,165 --> 01:10:55,501
I guess he forgot
to turn off the light before he left.

1148
01:10:55,585 --> 01:10:57,545
My gosh. Captain Ri.

1149
01:10:57,628 --> 01:10:58,963
I thought he was perfect.

1150
01:10:59,046 --> 01:11:01,466
I didn't know he would make such mistakes.

1151
01:11:05,011 --> 01:11:08,681
My gosh. Someone is inside there.

1152
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:11,642
What? Is she a ghost?

1153
01:11:13,186 --> 01:11:14,562
Come out.

1154
01:11:18,566 --> 01:11:20,610
-Who are you?
-Look at her.

1155
01:11:21,152 --> 01:11:23,529
I asked who you are.

1156
01:11:24,113 --> 01:11:28,034
Why were you hiding
in Captain Ri's kimchi cellar?

1157
01:11:28,242 --> 01:11:29,243
Forget it.

1158
01:11:29,744 --> 01:11:33,372
Even the mutes can talk once they go
to the State Security Department.

1159
01:11:33,873 --> 01:11:34,999
Right?

1160
01:11:36,459 --> 01:11:38,085
-My gosh.
-What's that sound?

1161
01:11:38,169 --> 01:11:39,962
-Move.
-What is it?

1162
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:43,424
-Does it say 729 there?
-What? 729?

1163
01:11:43,508 --> 01:11:46,135
-It says 729 there.
-What's going on?

1164
01:11:46,427 --> 01:11:49,013
-Who's driving it?
-That vehicle...

1165
01:11:49,639 --> 01:11:51,557
-My gosh.
-It says 729 there.

1166
01:11:51,641 --> 01:11:53,518
I've never seen that car in person.

1167
01:11:53,601 --> 01:11:55,603
-I can't believe it.
-Goodness.

1168
01:12:20,294 --> 01:12:22,880
What are you doing to my fiancée?

1169
01:12:22,964 --> 01:12:24,549
-What? Fiancée?
-Did I hear it wrong?

1170
01:12:24,632 --> 01:12:26,175
-He's engaged?
-That's his fiancée?

1171
01:12:26,259 --> 01:12:28,010
What did you just say?

1172
01:12:28,678 --> 01:12:32,473
I would appreciate it if you put away
the gun you're pointing at my fiancée.

1173
01:14:22,833 --> 01:14:25,461
If some sightseeing
would have helped me feel better,

1174
01:14:26,003 --> 01:14:27,922
I wouldn't have come all the way here.

1175
01:14:37,723 --> 01:14:39,684
I don't have a home to return to.

1176
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:50,027
This isn't going to work on me.

1177
01:16:02,058 --> 01:16:04,435
So I introduced her to them,
and he just said "Okay."

1178
01:16:04,518 --> 01:16:07,730
So what did you introduce her as?

1179
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:11,108
I guess you could call it
a kind of disguise tactic.

1180
01:16:11,192 --> 01:16:12,276
She came from South Korea.

1181
01:16:12,359 --> 01:16:15,446
That's how they all fall in love.

1182
01:16:15,529 --> 01:16:16,447
<i>One hundred percent.</i>

1183
01:16:17,364 --> 01:16:20,242
What missions have you undertaken,
and where?

1184
01:16:20,326 --> 01:16:22,328
I am not allowed to tell you.

1185
01:16:22,411 --> 01:16:24,830
<i>That woman is a Type 11 individual.</i>

1186
01:16:24,914 --> 01:16:27,208
That makes him impervious.

1187
01:16:27,291 --> 01:16:30,044
By the way, do you have
a girlfriend who plays the piano?

1188
01:16:30,127 --> 01:16:33,714
<i>If we plan this out accordingly,</i>
<i>we can use that woman to destroy</i>

1189
01:16:33,798 --> 01:16:36,675
his whole family. That's what I mean.

1190
01:16:37,384 --> 01:16:39,720
-Two of us.
-She's going back to Pyongyang tonight.

1191
01:16:40,346 --> 01:16:42,014
Look at me, nothing else.

1192
01:16:42,348 --> 01:16:45,059
